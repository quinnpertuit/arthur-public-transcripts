"48940","49820"," Yee-haw. "
"75260","76540"," Oh, wait, what did I do down there?"
"88040","89060"," Chaz, good morning."
"89220","89540"," How are you?"
"91420","92800"," Gee, daddy gold."
"99620","101720"," Good morning, everybody. "
"101720","102640"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"103000","104140"," Y'all doing well?"
"104760","106920"," Y'all ready to get another week started here?"
"107740","109240"," We can go up today."
"109760","120290"," I made a post this morning that made a post"
"120290","130110"," this morning that to let the markets open up, we'll see if sometimes"
"132580","135360"," the market can look like it's going up."
"135360","138760"," And I'll show you my reasoning at some point here in just a moment. "
"139680","148640"," It's one of those days where even if we're going up, it's sometimes better to let the"
"148640","151480"," market open up so that you can find the direction."
"154060","155460"," Same thing would hold true."
"155720","159400"," If we were going down in this bell, I would say the same thing to a bear. "
"161180","164220"," I would say, temperature expectations."
"166280","167140"," Let's see here."
"169880","172240"," And let the markets show you the direction. "
"172660","174300"," That would be the key this morning."
"182940","183920"," All right, I posed this."
"185300","186720"," Let's get straight into it. "
"188160","190840"," Trying to get the everything set up here in the background."
"193900","196020"," Let's have a look and see if we are range bound."
"196300","196860"," We might be. "
"197000","197920"," I think that we are."
"199880","203680"," Now we can break out of range, but just where my cursor is in here."
"204200","205320"," Let's keep an eye on this. "
"207620","210160"," I'll explain to you why in just a moment."
"211480","212680"," My thoughts here."
"215780","219580"," On this Monday, my thoughts here are that. "
"223980","227460"," You let the market open up and find a direction."
"227880","230180"," I don't think it would matter if we're going up or down this morning."
"231760","234120"," I would temp your expectations if you're a bear. "
"234320","236900"," I would temper your expectations if you're a bull."
"239920","243800"," I would let the markets show you the direction that we're heading in."
"244740","247820"," That sounds counter to productive. "
"248120","248840"," You want to call it."
"252670","255610"," And say we're going here, point your finger or whatever it is you're going to say."
"255790","256390"," If I had to guess. "
"258950","263270"," It's going to be like a rainbow sideways and down to consolidation."
"265390","272710"," We also have, you know, yelling on deck at some point around 10 a.m. Not on deck, but let"
"272710","273530"," me see if I get this right."
"274390","275370"," Keep that up. "
"277890","279850"," We're going to close that up here in just a minute."
"281910","284310"," I'm going to show you guys what I'm talking about here."
"286730","288090"," Hope everybody had a great weekend. "
"289370","291530"," I had a great week last week."
"291750","294670"," So I ended up taking off some time and."
"298550","299990"," I've been I've been. "
"301030","303030"," Well, I'm thinking about selling my boat."
"304510","308130"," And while I'm thinking about that, I'm also provisioning."
"309450","312070"," We had a late spring and. "
"313590","315950"," I was provisioning for."
"318970","322390"," The upcoming season for hiking, biking, camping."
"323930","327530"," Oh, subboarding, kayaking, sailing, all that kind of stuff. "
"330430","333790"," So seeing from a poll here, a Canadian home prices are to fall."
"333890","337670"," A median of eight spot 9% this year versus a 12% fall."
"337810","342490"," If that was seen in the March poll, same poll states that Canada's average home prices are to rise"
"342490","342790"," to. "
"342970","344930"," I'm going to mute this this here for you."
"344930","347570"," Now, just off of."
"349690","351090"," We're going to take a look at something here. "
"354690","356230"," Just off of this open."
"357210","358550"," Normally I would say."
"364280","365580"," We're going up here. "
"368800","370960"," Let me meet some of this stuff here."
"374000","374980"," Does a bull."
"378790","381030"," Move some of the songs stuff down here. "
"381510","382010"," Get some walking."
"382270","382770"," I got some walking."
"382970","383690"," It's going on this morning. "
"384170","385090"," It's what takes me forever."
"385130","386850"," Sometimes this kind of stuff here."
"390570","393170"," I've got like some screens set to. "
"394270","399550"," 60% some screen set to 90% off this opening bell right here."
"400290","404590"," Is there anything stopping us from just ripping faces off on this boat?"
"404590","405470"," No, nothing."
"408330","410430"," Can we like rip some faces off here?"
"410550","411210"," Grab that 430. "
"413450","415630"," Bounce along and then consolidate down."
"416070","416350"," Absolutely."
"417150","418110"," We do that off this bell?"
"418490","418810"," Absolutely. "
"420470","423110"," Can we get velocity to keep going higher?"
"423570","423610"," Sure."
"425630","428250"," Is there a trap up here for bulls more than likely?"
"428870","430210"," Where do I like to buy down here?"
"430210","431710"," Call me Kirsten down here."
"432530","433490"," That's where I like to buy. "
"434710","437130"," If you're a bear, you want to sell this, right?"
"437370","438690"," Or take profit Friday."
"439030","439490"," Take profit."
"439770","440470"," We talked about that. "
"443390","447330"," You can kind of see here."
"448010","449390"," Like, what do I want to do?"
"450250","453550"," I'm sure you've got bulls out there just saying buy the dip by the dip."
"453890","455490"," And we can get another bump up here. "
"456950","460590"," But it does result in some sort of catastrophe."
"461130","462210"," Even if we get up there."
"462530","465510"," So, enter today if you wanted to buy that dip as long as it showed itself. "
"465810","469070"," We are coming into hourly velocity tag here."
"469530","472710"," It could be short lived as my points and then some kind of a roll."
"473090","475710"," This roll, though, I don't think it's as deep as you think it is. "
"476790","482970"," We also have some treasuries being, some T-bills being sold today, I believe at 10 a.m. But just"
"482970","486070"," for me, when I'm buying a, when I'm looking to buy a dip, I'm a bull, right?"
"486210","487850"," When I'm looking to buy it up, I'm trying to buy down here."
"487850","488910"," Trying to buy that."
"489530","490630"," Trying to buy this. "
"491830","500510"," I want that sustained run trade in some kind of, uh, some kind of, uh, comfort, right?"
"502130","503930"," And I don't want it to be short lived."
"504170","508970"," If you end up getting this range, let's say you get yelling, say some nonsense, you come back down"
"508970","513909"," here and then you get your range bound sideways trade that kind of sets itself up over time."
"513929","514190"," Okay. "
"514650","516289"," Just be conscious of this."
"516289","521770"," I know that, uh, I know the bulls are, you know, fever, feverly wanting to just buy this opening"
"521770","522150"," bell."
"522970","524050"," The next two minutes. "
"524050","525750"," So just the spy specifically."
"527470","529010"," We'll look at the cues real quick."
"529790","530870"," We're looking at NDX. "
"533950","534890"," That's NDQ."
"538710","539670"," NASDAQ 100."
"540210","543190"," You know, the NASDAQ 100, not showing it as much. "
"543710","546330"," It is the Arley's racing up."
"546750","548350"," You see this role here?"
"549050","550710"," You get a little bit of down in here, maybe."
"551590","553030"," This comes down, right?"
"554710","556010"," NASDAQ kind of cools. "
"556090","558150"," It's jet up jets on this open, possibly."
"559490","561610"," IWM everybody's looking for the RT."
"561810","563370"," I guess we can do RTY. "
"563470","563830"," It doesn't matter."
"567290","569670"," RTY ready to rotate, right?"
"569890","571470"," Look at the explosion in here ready to go."
"573190","575110"," Arley not looking so good. "
"576190","578970"," Uh, though the RTY trade is likely odd."
"579130","580730"," You can see the consolidation down."
"580870","582270"," They're looking for an explosion move higher. "
"582730","587670"," Target above 186.2.7 on the rut this morning."
"588530","590710"," Uh, some interest at the sea this morning."
"590990","596530"," How if we actually go up, if we reverse and come back down, then we blast higher to that target"
"596530","604760"," of 187.5. The last thing we'll take a look at is"
"604760","608820"," the VIX this morning on the opening bell. "
"620660","623720"," We got the VIX in a death spiral still."
"625080","632670"," You get that push down, and then maybe that push up here on the VIX this morning."
"633450","634830"," Trying to squeeze itself higher. "
"635490","636270"," Downside target."
"637790","638310"," 1250."
"640990","642410"," 13 somewhere in there. "
"646360","647580"," On the VIX."
"649800","654040"," It would be fascinating to see if we can squeeze this up in this opening bell."
"654920","657360"," I truly think though it's some kind of a range bound move. "
"657620","658860"," We either like tag the high."
"661100","662560"," Either going to tag the high."
"663400","664600"," Roll and start trading sideways. "
"665980","669240"," Or we get that first leg down and the dip gets bought."
"670000","673660"," Come back up and try to fight for that 433 on SPX."
"676700","678500"," We'll get SPX as well if you want. "
"687460","688780"," You can see it right here."
"689220","690280"," Top of the key, Mom."
"692080","694820"," Here's the 432 620. "
"695660","697840"," So you get that nice squeeze up higher."
"699260","701780"," Then we end up getting that consolidation move right here."
"713610","715130"," Oh, and I'm trying to log in to Tasty. "
"717190","719450"," Another, I'm trying to log into my account right now."
"721430","721930"," Damn it."
"722310","723390"," Oh, that was thinking of the wrong. "
"729270","731730"," Trying to log in so I can take some trades with you."
"747210","747870"," Here we go."
"748030","751590"," I'll give you some exact targets on the day if you think we're going up there. "
"751890","764400"," 434.14. Let's"
"772170","774590"," take a look on the SPY here."
"780320","781820"," You got to see my picture."
"782640","784800"," Is my video quality okay?"
"785060","785940"," It looks a little dark, man. "
"786120","786300"," Hold on."
"788440","791660"," Can you see my face on my video or is it dark right now?"
"794240","801070"," This is the previous high right here."
"802230","803490"," 42875 from Friday. "
"806390","809630"," This is the previous gap from way back when."
"811350","814930"," This is where the old dirty dog sellers are way up here."
"815950","816830"," Here's our two. "
"817470","839680"," And then our three the big boy at 434.59. These"
"839680","840720"," are the Jimbrough sellers."
"841680","844880"," These are the guys that only these are the guys that missed leg day."
"851820","854540"," These are the guys that get right over because they forgot to do leg day. "
"857980","859480"," Previous gap from way back when."
"868600","869340"," There's your pivot."
"870560","872340"," We're bullish on the open so far. "
"872340","876240"," We are trading above the five minute trade."
"881600","882600"," Miss like day."
"883000","884340"," I didn't miss like day. "
"884640","886500"," I didn't miss like day this weekend though."
"889100","890280"," My video looks normal."
"891140","893320"," Yeah, normal like the camera. "
"894520","895600"," Can you see my face?"
"897100","899400"," You see old dirty dog Jim James here."
"899740","902480"," I'm looking on twitch on one monitor over here and it looks kind of dark."
"906800","907800"," I can turn it up. "
"913530","914950"," Turn that one up turn."
"916130","917450"," That one up a little bit."
"919770","920510"," Looks good. "
"921930","922850"," Right on right on."
"929050","931010"," And I've got some work I got to do this morning."
"931250","934030"," So you're going to see me here and you're going to get. "
"934390","937550"," I have to take some phone calls this morning and set some stuff up."
"938330","939250"," So you will see."
"939250","945520"," Yeah, this all looks like algos, man. "
"945860","948640"," This all this is all looking like algos to me."
"952640","954080"," Like let's set a range."
"954360","954940"," Let's get up there. "
"966630","971390"," Twenty five thousand zero eight call buyers on four twenty nine see."
"972050","974650"," They're trading for seventy six cents right now."
"988820","990440"," They're making me chase right now. "
"1012010","1013610"," They're fucking dicks dude."
"1020120","1023540"," Whenever they make me chase that pisses me off when they make me chase."
"1044290","1048430"," Have a new high here of four twenty eight ninety four. "
"1090500","1092200"," Watch that wild open here."
"1092200","1093580"," This one bar right here."
"1095700","1097300"," And just look at that gnarliness. "
"1097840","1098840"," That's the one minute bar."
"1100060","1103220"," Five minutes just going absolutely crazy right here."
"1118160","1120420"," Yeah, this is one of those mornings, man. "
"1120600","1122040"," You just kind of let it open up."
"1122100","1123680"," It's not really the place to."
"1125040","1127040"," It's not the place to be long or short. "
"1127480","1131980"," We could green bar it straight up and just tag that caller up there."
"1133340","1137680"," We could red barch straight down and have we didn't start selling here."
"1137780","1138620"," It's not really. "
"1140220","1150120"," I mean, just before I came into the open today,"
"1150120","1150980"," I was like, yeah."
"1151660","1156200"," This morning, I was like, I was like, if I tell them that I'm not going to start streaming until"
"1156200","1158120"," like 10, 30, 11 o'clock."
"1158280","1159380"," They're going to think that I'm hung over. "
"1159800","1161120"," They're going to think that I've been drinking."
"1163040","1165120"," Like you guys don't believe me when it's."
"1165820","1167220"," If we're crashing, right?"
"1167220","1168580"," Like probably got an inter-day crashing. "
"1168780","1170920"," You guys were like, he ain't here because it's just crashing."
"1172100","1174120"," If we go to the moon, you guys don't say anything."
"1174500","1174860"," He's hung over. "
"1174920","1175660"," He's got to be hung over."
"1175780","1176620"," That's why he's not here today."
"1176620","1177780"," We're going up and he's not here. "
"1179020","1181520"," So like this morning, I was like, dude, I don't want to."
"1181560","1183760"," I don't want to stream until like 10, 30, 11."
"1184320","1187040"," It has more to do with this action right here. "
"1187340","1189200"," Like I don't want to be in stream going."
"1190560","1192940"," Take a long take a take a short here."
"1195480","1200940"," Probably the why is this course of action is to let the market open up. "
"1201080","1202120"," Let it show you the direction."
"1203720","1204780"," Let it tag a high."
"1204960","1205620"," Let it tag a low. "
"1206560","1207640"," And we got our range for the week."
"1218070","1219810"," And just watch this action right now."
"1220010","1221010"," I mean, this isn't normal, right?"
"1221190","1222610"," You know, this is not normal on an open. "
"1225290","1228190"," Oh, yeah, no, this is not just this is a normal action."
"1230970","1232150"," I think we go up here."
"1233270","1237590"," I think we go up and we get above SPX is caller. "
"1239050","1242090"," We are raised some of this stuff, but I don't think it like extends."
"1243110","1244870"," If we get up there, I don't think that it extends."
"1245090","1248190"," I think it's like go up there, tag it and roll it over. "
"1248330","1252070"," And then we start to work on establishing a new zone up here."
"1253070","1255270"," I think it's going to be as easy as people think that it is."
"1256830","1266570"," What is this vicious"
"1266570","1267350"," battle at open?"
"1267730","1268710"," It's not really a battle. "
"1268890","1269930"," This is algorithms."
"1272650","1276670"," I should have just said, just give it time to open this morning."
"1278630","1284290"," It looks to me like we technically have some numbers to hit above. "
"1285250","1291150"," The market at large looks like it wants to trade sideways and down."
"1291750","1295910"," And rotate into small caps and some DIA."
"1299890","1302810"," We also have some danger to the market. "
"1304750","1309910"," You know, it's a treasure going to sell a bunch of shit today to fund the TGA."
"1311690","1314190"," And so it's probably waiting on those numbers."
"1314390","1322770"," Those numbers come out at 10 a.m. Anybody talking about that this morning?"
"1322890","1323830"," I don't know if they are not. "
"1327110","1331370"," I don't see anything."
"1334090","1336870"," Biden signs the debt limit spending book half of earning default."
"1338870","1340230"," Kind of expected that. "
"1340530","1342090"," Anybody talking about yelling this morning?"
"1349140","1350860"," Now trading for 29."
"1361520","1364260"," Dude, what in the fuck is going on with this?"
"1365200","1366540"," I'm trading this right now."
"1366640","1367200"," Believe it or not. "
"1367360","1371740"," I'm not telling you guys that I'm trading on this because I think you're going to get fucked up."
"1372320","1374060"," I'm having a hard time even getting closed."
"1374320","1376980"," It opens and closes on my contracts right now. "
"1378000","1386700"," I'm like by 41 self 51 by 41 by 51 or self 51 and they just went to like 53"
"1386700","1387960"," and was like fuck you."
"1388120","1390440"," We ain't doing this for you."
"1391840","1393640"," People with dealers are like blow me. "
"1395900","1396300"," Trappy."
"1405740","1406940"," Trappy, Trappy, Trappy."
"1408180","1408660"," Good morning, everybody. "
"1408880","1409220"," How are you all doing?"
"1412370","1414290"," No, I don't know that she speaks at 10."
"1414890","1418730"," I think it has to do this has to do with a few things, right?"
"1420830","1422810"," They have to sell treasury bills, right?"
"1422810","1424030"," They've sell tea bills this morning."
"1424590","1430310"," The big question is does anybody show up to buy them at the price they want to sell them at?"
"1432270","1436950"," The other question is do they unload them into the market regardless of price?"
"1437250","1440190"," Or does the buyer of last resort show up?"
"1441010","1442970"," There's questions about discount window too. "
"1443190","1444650"," Here we go."
"1444730","1448290"," Coming in to the market right now."
"1448670","1451270"," I'm telling you, man, between now and 10 am. "
"1452010","1453310"," I'd be fucking flat."
"1453930","1456430"," I'm going to give you some real insight here."
"1456950","1457830"," Like 10 am. "
"1458050","1459730"," You don't want to be long or short here."
"1462270","1466430"," And the like half the commenters will be like, I called it up or down."
"1466850","1470090"," But if you're just out there being a trader, you just let this shit happen at 10. "
"1474200","1476220"," I'll also join the S&P 500."
"1480100","1481260"," I'm telling you, man."
"1482140","1483500"," Live to fight another day. "
"1484280","1488460"," This isn't like, this is like an ER, right?"
"1488720","1490100"," I can set up the ER for you."
"1490200","1492740"," I can tell you that's going to tag this, this, this and this."
"1494160","1499100"," And all you need is like some guy from Samuel Adams bear to be like, oh, we miscalculated. "
"1499360","1502820"," Never, never issued guidance and we're down a thousand points."
"1502820","1512600"," Oh, the apple event being the side right doubt that."
"1519880","1521180"," This has to do with the. "
"1522740","1523600"," The element."
"1525320","1525840"," 100%."
"1525840","1530600"," Look at these violent moves right now. "
"1531900","1534380"," Do not get fucking caught in this."
"1537720","1538940"," Yeah, we can talk about oil."
"1539300","1540660"," Oil is another big one right now, right?"
"1540660","1541480"," Oil gas. "
"1541900","1544540"," It's like, things you guys want to be watching this entire week."
"1545420","1546060"," Listen closely."
"1548560","1549680"," Oil and gas. "
"1550940","1552920"," Is there a rotation trade?"
"1556580","1562480"," How much how much money does yellow need and the impact of that?"
"1564480","1566620"," And then that leads us into, of course."
"1567700","1570800"," The Fed pause or raising rates."
"1570800","1574900"," I think that has, I think that's where the interplay is, the market reaction. "
"1577800","1579620"," To raising rates or not."
"1579780","1580640"," And then we've got, of course."
"1581680","1582380"," What do we got?"
"1584960","1589440"," We've got rate decisions coming out of at least two countries this week, I think. "
"1589940","1591400"," So we'll look at that as well."
"1596260","1599840"," Yeah, there's, I have no, I have no, I just got out right now."
"1599960","1601440"," I'm not flat right now if you want to know. "
"1604700","1607120"," There's a couple of nice trades in here as we grind higher."
"1610810","1613550"," Let me take a look on the previous."
"1617590","1621150"," I don't want to be the guy to be like, yeah, go long calls here. "
"1621790","1623130"," I get what you guys are saying."
"1623130","1628190"," And then we just red bar straight to the depths of hell and you're like, I'll capitalize your"
"1628190","1628430"," fault."
"1632070","1634610"," Let's go back in time here and just take a look at some stuff. "
"1640550","1643310"," Let's take a peek as to where are we?"
"1649430","1651870"," So just on the right in here, right?"
"1653370","1654970"," Let's see that line right there."
"1655110","1656110"," That's where that gap is."
"1657010","1658750"," This is our one right here. "
"1658830","1659690"," Watch my cursor right here."
"1659810","1661030"," This is our one right here."
"1662850","1665590"," This is where the actual gap started right there. "
"1667270","1668650"," So the gap started right there."
"1670810","1674310"," We got it on a four hour too and see if we can clean it up a little bit."
"1684490","1685230"," Back here. "
"1703650","1705470"," We got a bunch of other crap up here."
"1711780","1712820"," We're 30s."
"1725700","1727120"," It's actually not that high. "
"1727280","1729000"," It's there."
"1762010","1762530"," Violent."
"1765190","1769350"," We are trading above our five minute here, five minute here. "
"1769810","1772870"," To the upside, previous gaps way back when old dirty dog sellers."
"1773730","1774470"," They're up here, right?"
"1774470","1776450"," This is going to be volatile."
"1776450","1779130"," No matter how you look at it, it's going to be volatile up here. "
"1780350","1782810"," We got a bunch of stuff up here."
"1783210","1792430"," 436, 438, 441, 443, all huge extensions filling in gaps."
"1794410","1796110"," 448, 450. "
"1807040","1808620"," Let me just look at this."
"1811260","1813580"," Algo is baby going to town."
"1819070","1820030"," 10 more minutes. "
"1820070","1820870"," We'll know what's up."
"1821170","1822950"," We've got some gaps down below to fill now."
"1823330","1824790"," We're just creating gaps all over the place. "
"1825650","1826470"," Got a gap here."
"1827370","1834520"," A gap here."
"1834520","1834660"," A gap here. "
"1835020","1844940"," A gap there."
"1848140","1849020"," A gap there."
"1849560","1856240"," I bet you these claps bears are like, I guarantee these claps bears are like. "
"1857460","1858360"," This is it."
"1858520","1859240"," This is the one."
"1862240","1862760"," Guaranteed. "
"1863460","1867140"," Guaranteed the claps bears are like, we're going to the depths of hell today."
"1869500","1871840"," I do have some question on that."
"1872160","1874080"," Do they just hammer the market with?"
"1878430","1879930"," Put some of this down here. "
"1880550","1885890"," Catch some of these previous, some of these pivots, the target one right there."
"1887590","1891550"," Another one right there."
"1896290","1898490"," There's the opening price right there. "
"1899390","1901290"," Tag that one right there."
"1910340","1912600"," Man, we got all kinds of shit left behind."
"1913360","1914540"," One right there. "
"1917360","1926240"," Right there."
"1929280","1930620"," Oh, yeah."
"1930620","1930880"," Yeah. "
"1940160","1947630"," Let's see where the hourly trigger is and the daily trigger."
"1949010","1950890"," This is not the place for a bull, man."
"1955580","1958320"," The place for a bull is to let the market open up. "
"1958460","1963380"," We got bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam down below."
"1965460","1966980"," It's all the way down at S2."
"1968920","1970640"," Get some bams down here too. "
"1974340","1975760"," Kinds of nice little lower targets."
"1976480","1976720"," Oh, yeah."
"1976860","1978660"," We got all kinds of shit to close up, don't we?"
"1979560","1981740"," All kinds of dirty dogs down here. "
"1984760","1987760"," This bears like really go close all that, all those pivots cap."
"1990100","1991660"," Fucking bulls got them bulls."
"1991980","1994460"," They're like leaving behind a path of destruction down there. "
"1997340","1999100"," Oh, we got another little one down there."
"1999780","2002640"," I'm just going to litter us with me."
"2002720","2004440"," Just look at that juicy shit down there. "
"2005540","2007720"," Start clearing all that nonsense out."
"2015730","2018390"," There's like, we're going to go, we're going to, someone get out the vacuum."
"2023550","2024970"," Let's see it spy real quick. "
"2029480","2030000"," Yeah."
"2030460","2030600"," Yeah."
"2031040","2033120"," Let the market breathe, baby. "
"2033820","2035080"," Let it breathe today."
"2036140","2036460"," 426."
"2038620","2041780"," This is where your hourly trigger is around 426ish. "
"2043080","2049360"," Your daily trigger is down at 41621."
"2054679","2056420"," Way down here."
"2061520","2063500"," Way down here. "
"2065360","2069120"," We could totally use like a minus 10% day, couldn't we?"
"2069900","2072219"," Just like send it down for three straight days."
"2072540","2075620"," Just like blast it down, clear all that nonsense up."
"2077920","2079719"," Bulls are like, dude, what are you doing to me?"
"2081580","2082980"," Don't be live streaming that. "
"2083500","2084260"," They believe you."
"2101270","2102450"," Warren, Jared, how are you?"
"2106610","2108510"," It is like I sold my calls."
"2110930","2112590"," Yeah, I chased a little bit. "
"2112770","2116070"," I was like, yeah, I'll grab a little bit of that."
"2116550","2118070"," Like 10 a.m. You don't want anything."
"2118290","2119650"," You want to fuck around next five minutes. "
"2120270","2122230"," Dude, don't fuck around next five minutes."
"2122450","2122850"," Let it be."
"2124030","2126870"," So many easy setups all day long up and down. "
"2127690","2130490"," No need to be jumping on hand grenades here."
"2133950","2137450"," No need to be jumping on a matter of fact, we'll put on the one minute because it should be"
"2137450","2137710"," fun."
"2138130","2141550"," A little bit of a bear plane forming right now. "
"2148330","2156990"," Yeah, we've got a we've got some probably a few things going on."
"2157050","2157710"," We got oil and gas."
"2158770","2163270"," We're going to talk about if there's a rotation trade to be had. "
"2164210","2168530"," We saw we saw TLT get hammered, right?"
"2169350","2172250"," We saw our divergence in TLT SPX."
"2172870","2173750"," Talk about that today."
"2174270","2175270"," How about yelling at 10?"
"2175690","2178950"," I'm not seeing anything in the background about yelling. "
"2179750","2181130"," Let me see if there's something I'm missing here."
"2181750","2185350"," Yeah, we got PMI and ISM numbers too."
"2197070","2199810"," Everyone wants the rotation trade. "
"2201810","2204810"," We saw a little bit of that in the overnight action, right?"
"2205070","2207090"," Hopefully some of you guys saw some of that in the overnight action."
"2209090","2212570"," It says we got factory orders at 10, ISM services at 10."
"2213910","2223650"," We had S&P US services PMI 55.1 previous 55.1 actual 4.9. The"
"2223650","2225090"," big one that's not on here. "
"2225430","2227370"," Let me go do a different economic cows."
"2227510","2229470"," A bunch of stuff not on this economic calendar."
"2230750","2231870"," That should be. "
"2233170","2235610"," It's not fucking figures."
"2243640","2251680"," My post this morning at trade, the trigger was about letting the market open this morning fine with"
"2251680","2252240"," the ranges."
"2252240","2257740"," If bulls are able to slam higher, we can follow that trade. "
"2258780","2262280"," If bears break out of a range, we can follow that trade as well."
"2263360","2267500"," So if we break underneath, here's the hourly trigger down here."
"2267580","2274520"," If we trade down here and we start to reject here, we'll follow that trade down as well. "
"2274520","2282920"," Let me see if I can get or"
"2282920","2288050"," times are right now."
"2288470","2292870"," I want US time, baby."
"2293010","2294490"," I want Wall Street time. "
"2313160","2316840"," They got the bill auctions this morning, 10.30 it's saying."
"2327900","2329840"," I don't think that they won't."
"2329840","2331320"," I don't think that they will either. "
"2331440","2334520"," I don't think we're getting that quote unquote market crash."
"2336380","2338220"," Because of how much they're selling."
"2338600","2340660"," I think though that it warrants. "
"2344580","2345840"," It's still warrants."
"2347600","2349600"," Patience as it happens, right?"
"2349780","2350440"," You want to just see."
"2352300","2354260"," It just stand off a little bit. "
"2355040","2357700"," We can all say what we think is going to happen."
"2358240","2361520"," But you don't you don't actually trade trade to that right."
"2361940","2364120"," Trade to just a little bit of. "
"2365200","2368600"," Patience to prove that prove itself so we don't know instruction."
"2368840","2369080"," We're going."
"2383550","2386370"," Yeah, there should be demand, but it doesn't remove money from the market. "
"2388030","2389490"," If you have too much demand, right?"
"2403870","2404530"," Yeah, yours."
"2404790","2407470"," I was having problems getting in on a trade this morning on the bell."
"2414180","2415080"," Yeah, it's believable. "
"2417060","2418760"," Let's see if it can change this time here."
"2431120","2435420"," So UST ETC Eastern Standard is minus five, right?"
"2437520","2439100"," Why the fuck am I showing?"
"2443920","2445300"," Why the fuck is US?"
"2448560","2450400"," Okay, I came back to."
"2452160","2459140"," The fuck is my time not working here?"
"2467200","2469740"," It's saying ISM's at nine, but it's not. "
"2470100","2470680"," It's at ten."
"2471660","2473640"," Minus five or minus six."
"2480900","2482140"," Minus four. "
"2483980","2493720"," It's actually minus four, right?"
"2494580","2496760"," Claiming that it's minus four."
"2505530","2506530"," Here we go."
"2506690","2508230"," UISM Services PMI. "
"2508230","2512190"," And then three month bills at eleven thirty."
"2521520","2524420"," It's not just it's not just no clear direction."
"2524740","2528160"," Here I'll show you guys once again. "
"2528800","2530920"," I tried to show it to you on the opening bell this morning."
"2533240","2535820"," On the triggers and on velocity."
"2537700","2541660"," That the market looks range bound to consolidate. "
"2541660","2543480"," We also have some."
"2545240","2550940"," You likely have institutions that are waiting to see what the treasury department does today."
"2552300","2553660"," With treasury bills. "
"2555240","2558940"," So you're watching the open this and there's a bunch of other stuff."
"2559100","2561780"," There's some rotation trade likely going on."
"2562220","2563680"," So you're watching horse trading, right?"
"2563880","2568360"," These are algorithms and computers that are trying to buy the dip in other places. "
"2571080","2577020"," I don't think that you see."
"2577520","2579940"," If you see a rotation trade into small caps."
"2582340","2586360"," I don't think that you see like damage done to the S&P 500. "
"2586480","2589160"," I think it's more like sideways and over like a rainbow."
"2590540","2592000"," Let me give you an example of it."
"2592140","2594320"," I'll show you a previous example of what I'm thinking here. "
"2594940","2598560"," I can be wrong here, but I'll show you a previous example."
"2598560","2602640"," We'll trade this up and down."
"2604400","2606000"," If we become range bound. "
"2609780","2611320"," These guys are gone now."
"2614200","2617000"," So if we become range bound, we'll know what our range is."
"2617200","2620000"," If we start to break out of range, we know right here. "
"2620780","2621700"," I want you to know."
"2622240","2624960"," So right here, this is our previous gap from way back when."
"2626720","2629500"," We know that JPM as a caller up here. "
"2629500","2634580"," So even if we tag it, we're likely going to consolidate there."
"2634720","2635680"," Not on a daily chart."
"2635800","2637220"," This is over the next week or so. "
"2637780","2645320"," We'll normally consolidate here and then it'll act to repel the market lower into end of quarter."
"2646220","2655280"," Not guaranteed, but likely to the downside."
"2658280","2666020"," Now, if we get a rotation trade into small caps or DIA, anything like that, along with that trade,"
"2666660","2669140"," some stuff is at almost zero in breath. "
"2669800","2672360"," We know oil was like that just a few days ago."
"2672860","2673860"," Oil on a busch."
"2674320","2678900"," When you guys are looking at your breath every week, oil was at like a three. "
"2680260","2681980"," That's max bearishness."
"2682640","2685180"," So you saw a bounce in oil last week."
"2685920","2691040"," Due to that, there's some other sectors that are being murdered in the background. "
"2693420","2696460"," So there could be a rotation trade going on as the point."
"2698240","2702460"," I'm going to show you a few things here."
"2710160","2715040"," And fascinatingly enough, you're watching a dip buy on this morning on XLU. "
"2715900","2718620"," So XLU has now had two up days."
"2720020","2721820"," I want to show you guys a couple of things here."
"2721920","2727380"," When these days happen, you guys want to be paying attention while no one's looking. "
"2729180","2732800"," So if nobody's looking in the background and you're like, what's going on?"
"2733080","2733900"," What's happening with the market?"
"2740060","2743240"," You should be checking individual sectors."
"2744900","2748680"," And utilities have been a bullish percentage."
"2751460","2757980"," We're at 59.6. That's bullish out of a possible 100, right?"
"2759000","2759740"," That's still bullish. "
"2761460","2762900"," Utilities are down at a 10."
"2762900","2768200"," In the last two sessions, utilities have been bought."
"2769420","2770660"," Energy was at a three. "
"2771360","2772520"," Now it's at a 73."
"2773240","2774340"," So they got bought, right?"
"2777160","2781800"," Consumer staples at 32.4. They were at like 25 earlier in the week."
"2782860","2784480"," Keep your eyes on that trade. "
"2787140","2789620"," But I want you guys to see something here."
"2792340","2794180"," Bring this up for you."
"2795100","2797100"," Back in April, I believe. "
"2798180","2799560"," Right here, April."
"2819220","2821580"," Something not exact, but comparable."
"2831090","2832890"," I want you to look at this. "
"2833350","2835550"," I want you to look at this daily here, okay?"
"2837890","2840830"," I want you to look at this daily right here."
"2841950","2844290"," I want you to see this daily up in here."
"2845710","2848790"," You can see I kind of have that rainbow effect right there. "
"2849010","2850310"," This sideways trade."
"2851550","2853250"," I want you to see that, okay?"
"2853490","2855250"," Now we're not as explosive to the upside."
"2855330","2857670"," We did have an explosive move here to the upside. "
"2860750","2862630"," On the hourly right, slam it up."
"2864230","2865850"," It's kind of like roll over."
"2866790","2869090"," You don't have all this chop in here. "
"2870530","2873970"," You have this like rainbow effect, right?"
"2874130","2874630"," And then we go higher."
"2875890","2879510"," So just, and then this daily, though, is the one that's got me going here."
"2879670","2883030"," So does that mean that?"
"2883630","2886510"," And just look at how beautiful that is. "
"2886890","2889490"," Does that mean we can't go up here and tag the SPX?"
"2889730","2889810"," No."
"2889810","2895470"," So this means that whether we do or don't, there's some kind of an action here."
"2896870","2900170"," It's like rainbow effect into end of quarter. "
"2901090","2901550"," Make sense?"
"2904210","2906030"," Does that mean that we don't go back up again?"
"2906310","2912730"," No, it just means just be careful that range bound effect."
"2915290","2918090"," Kind of that trade into end of quarter."
"2919710","2921450"," Some of you can't have highs up here. "
"2921630","2923250"," No, because we can't have lows down here."
"2923310","2926790"," No, it's just that overall feeling of."
"2929350","2931230"," Here's a 430 up here, right?"
"2934450","2939050"," So if I'm telling you, yeah, look for that range bound effect down into the month. "
"2940010","2945270"," If we trade up here and you go, boom, cap, we're not doing that range bound trade."
"2945270","2945710"," Sure."
"2946030","2949830"," As long as we do this, I'll take this trade right here to 440. "
"2951850","2957830"," But until this happens in this consolidation and a confirmation that we're going higher happens,"
"2958470","2961730"," this looks like range bound consolidation to the downside."
"2962290","2963110"," So it's looking like."
"2964150","2966790"," And we also have this daily trigger over here. "
"2967390","2968310"," See it right there?"
"2969130","2976310"," Right down here at 416, so you get that nice rainbow, that nice sideways effect, right?"
"2977450","2984210"," Hourly comes down, waits for the daily, comes back up, everybody's in full panic mode."
"2984330","2985230"," We're going to crash, boom."
"2986350","2987310"," We're up and we're running again. "
"2988510","2989070"," Make sense?"
"2989910","2992810"," 14th, 26th, 30th."
"2996070","2997790"," Guys, get me, get what I'm saying there."
"3000810","3002670"," So unless that happens, right?"
"3002830","3011270"," Unless we get above and hold and confirm the leg higher, the trade is range bound. "
"3022570","3029510"," Even if we trade up here, if we trade up to, so this is the same trade, right?"
"3029510","3038210"," So we get up here, slam, GPM's happy, woohoo, dinner thing, and we roll over, right?"
"3039350","3040790"," So let's say we get up here."
"3043090","3046370"," We start to make our way higher to 440s."
"3047150","3048650"," We'll take that trade, right?"
"3049630","3050590"," Confirms the leg higher. "
"3052050","3053650"," Confirms are going to trade 430 to 440."
"3053650","3063410"," We'll trade this, but until this proves itself, the trade looks like rotation, consolidation"
"3064730","3067790"," for the leg to, between 430, 440."
"3072830","3075010"," Some consider Tesla tech. "
"3077770","3080250"," I consider Tesla beta."
"3082270","3086250"," When Tesla can move on its own, whenever the fucking wants, and it can sell whenever the fucking"
"3086250","3086510"," wants."
"3091010","3100390"," Like, just when I think that Tesla's going to be, like, trade with the S&P, it doesn't. "
"3101830","3106790"," Just when I think it's going to go lower when the S&P's burning, Tesla goes upright, all that kind"
"3106790","3107310"," of cool stuff."
"3108570","3110390"," Tesla kind of moves on its own, right?"
"3110970","3111890"," So look at Tesla."
"3115050","3116030"," Got no problems. "
"3116170","3116530"," We're going to Tesla."
"3116530","3117370"," I love Tesla, right?"
"3117550","3119070"," We have a price target on the high for it."
"3120030","3123110"," We like two things about Tesla right now. "
"3127120","3129820"," We like the hourly and the daily, right?"
"3130100","3132640"," We love buying this daily down on the low back here."
"3133380","3134740"," Talked all about this, right?"
"3134920","3136700"," We made this giant move down here."
"3137900","3142180"," On this lower daily down here, it's like, yeah, fuck yeah, we're buying this, right?"
"3142460","3143640"," We ran it straight up. "
"3145000","3146460"," How bullish can it get?"
"3147000","3147960"," It's pretty close."
"3150060","3152300"," Pretty close to where it needs to chill out."
"3152700","3154340"," So, on Tesla. "
"3155340","3157520"," Right around where it needs to chill the fuck out."
"3157780","3161480"," So, I'm sure you're bullish here in Tesla."
"3161820","3164200"," What I always like to see here, let's show it to you now. "
"3164200","3166160"," Let's show it right here."
"3168560","3172080"," What I like to see in Tesla is we got the break above, right?"
"3172840","3173580"," Smashed above."
"3174800","3174840"," Hulk. "
"3175200","3176120"," Hulk of candles."
"3176780","3177920"," This is awesome."
"3179020","3180680"," This is the same with spy, right?"
"3181040","3184660"," I want to see the retest, the consolidation. "
"3186660","3189780"," I want to see the hourly come up and lend a hand to get higher."
"3190580","3192140"," And then that explosive move higher."
"3192140","3197400"," I want to have my money ready to go for higher highs. "
"3198260","3205960"," And, to be honest, I'd really like to see the daily come racing up, which it is."
"3206140","3207100"," This is all good to see."
"3207780","3210080"," Daily coming above right now to get above the weekly. "
"3211340","3213280"," Saw the big dip buy come in down here."
"3213420","3214260"," This is all good to see."
"3216720","3224140"," So, the first thing I would say to you for today would be keep an eye on. "
"3224420","3227340"," Matter of fact, I'll just hold on a second here."
"3228940","3237280"," I will set some alerts right now in the background for points of interest on Tesla on Tesla."
"3239260","3249670"," Crossing down, buy Tesla"
"3249670","3250690"," question mark. "
"3254000","3255310"," Create that alert."
"3256230","3267690"," That alert"
"3267690","3276690"," crossing down, buy Tesla"
"3276690","3280330"," question mark."
"3281070","3282550"," Create. "
"3282550","3282770"," Create."
"3284410","3285050"," Okay."
"3285510","3287230"," I got some Tesla alerts set. "
"3287850","3288970"," So, if you're a Tesla bull."
"3290810","3293330"," I'm interested in two numbers today on Tesla."
"3293670","3299950"," I'm interested in two thirteen forty nine and one eighty six ninety two ish. "
"3304550","3306430"," Congratulations Tesla bulls."
"3306670","3307730"," You have not gotten above."
"3308430","3310310"," You haven't been bullish at all. "
"3312190","3313930"," Like we are right now in Tesla."
"3314270","3317950"," So, personally, just a little bit of patience."
"3318930","3321090"," Let your friends catch up to you. "
"3322230","3323730"," And provide the."
"3326810","3329630"," The velocity that you need to go higher."
"3331530","3332670"," Closing out some of these. "
"3334790","3337130"," Finally starting to close out all this crap back here."
"3339470","3340610"," These are a bunch of gaps."
"3341590","3343370"," Gatsby and filled down below for the bulls. "
"3345730","3349350"," Bears got a nice bear playing here."
"3350810","3351890"," Just tag this one."
"3366700","3367620"," There's our one. "
"3367840","3368380"," There's your pivot."
"3374650","3377130"," Have a bear playing on the one minute right now."
"3387980","3389880"," You got the huge head fake on T and X."
"3392280","3393480"," Spy looking like it's rolling. "
"3396060","3397220"," You guys are vicious."
"3403160","3404580"," I'll be honest with you."
"3404840","3405620"," I'm going to be honest with. "
"3405780","3407320"," I don't care if you're a bull or a bear."
"3407460","3408540"," I'm going to be really honest with you."
"3408640","3408780"," Okay. "
"3409940","3413340"," I would look for an upper and lower range."
"3414080","3416400"," And I would trade that range."
"3419380","3420760"," I would. "
"3421560","3427820"," I would look for that range bound trading in the spy."
"3432720","3433680"," That's right."
"3433880","3435060"," Nothing has happened yet. "
"3439910","3440870"," I'm going to warn you."
"3441030","3441570"," Bulls and bears."
"3441950","3442590"," I'm going to warn you both. "
"3444030","3444710"," Let's spy."
"3445090","3445610"," Find a range."
"3446730","3447330"," Let it breathe. "
"3448030","3448450"," Drink some coffee."
"3448730","3448930"," Relax."
"3449210","3449790"," It's summertime. "
"3449990","3450370"," Congratulations."
"3452190","3453910"," No, this is not Trend Day."
"3454210","3455510"," It doesn't look like it to me. "
"3457750","3459150"," This is not Trend Day up."
"3459310","3460110"," I can assure you that."
"3460230","3461050"," It doesn't look like it. "
"3462190","3465130"," If it shows itself that we're going Trend Day up, I'll let you know."
"3472710","3474010"," It's not Crash Day."
"3474230","3474390"," We're not. "
"3474710","3475950"," It's a 10-18."
"3476350","3476570"," We're not."
"3476910","3478430"," We haven't started crashing yet. "
"3478750","3480650"," So let it open up."
"3481610","3485490"," I'm going to assume that theta gang is out there and they're just like getting their stretch on."
"3486110","3488750"," They're like, here I got the higher end of my fly. "
"3489050","3490290"," I'm going to get the lower end of my fly."
"3491070","3494110"," We're going to let all these stupid bulls and bears."
"3497390","3498590"," Theta is going to rule. "
"3499010","3499870"," If I had to guess."
"3508230","3509050"," Yeah, I know."
"3509410","3509850"," Agreed. "
"3509990","3510930"," But to me, it looks bearish."
"3511010","3512410"," I'm not making a move unless it moves below."
"3512670","3512710"," Yeah. "
"3514450","3515730"," To you, it looks bearish."
"3516670","3516930"," It looks."
"3517710","3520630"," It looks like it's really hard right now is. "
"3521610","3523390"," It's really hard right now to crash."
"3525490","3527970"," The S&P 500 if there's a if there's."
"3528590","3530650"," So like if everything was Maxwell. "
"3530870","3531730"," So this is where it's."
"3531830","3532750"," Let me show you guys some."
"3534890","3536850"," Let me show you guys something I'm talking about here. "
"3537210","3539550"," Give a better representation what I'm saying to you."
"3540630","3541850"," That's a good question, Darth."
"3548620","3549940"," It's a good thing that you're saying here. "
"3552240","3553420"," Like, can we get out here?"
"3553600","3553800"," Yes."
"3553800","3561750"," The daily here."
"3575380","3575940"," Normally. "
"3577280","3578780"," Normally right on breath."
"3584030","3585710"," You guys look at this here, right?"
"3586330","3586990"," Let me just see this."
"3595550","3597530"," Normally have like an even distribution. "
"3598030","3599810"," See how tech is at ninety one eighty."
"3603230","3607130"," Normally you'd have an even distribution or you'd see a rotation into other sectors."
"3607470","3612310"," But we all know that there's only a few tickers holding up the stank market. "
"3612810","3615330"," We know that later in the week last week we got some rotation."
"3616430","3617890"," Into some of the sectors."
"3620110","3620590"," So. "
"3622270","3625250"," We knew last week we got some rotation into some of the."
"3626250","3629330"," Some of the sectors that were getting no love."
"3630990","3631670"," So. "
"3633750","3635310"," Financials man got some love."
"3636130","3638470"," Energy was at three last week."
"3638490","3639990"," It's at seventy three right now. "
"3641810","3643050"," Consumer staples."
"3643670","3644390"," No love right."
"3645530","3649410"," Like all these communications doing okay, but. "
"3650090","3653150"," A few tickers driving communication services, but."
"3654710","3657350"," There are a bunch of underlying tickers in here."
"3658090","3661190"," Inside of the market that got bit up last week. "
"3662030","3663450"," My point here is."
"3664410","3666070"," If we do that rotation."
"3667050","3668950"," We're in this really weird place where. "
"3669710","3670950"," Normally over here."
"3672190","3675410"," When there's no word place where normally normally."
"3676690","3681050"," All everything would be bit up and we just like dump hard and fast. "
"3681650","3683490"," Where everything isn't bit up."
"3683490","3686330"," I would temper expectations to the downside."
"3688850","3690910"," Because the SMP isn't one ticker. "
"3691310","3693250"," That's the problem for bears is that."
"3694090","3696290"," That's the trick that I see for bears."
"3697310","3697710"," Is that. "
"3698530","3700950"," I don't know what the fuck is going on here."
"3702850","3709650"," Let me see fix all this."
"3715360","3717380"," I think the expectation is. "
"3718140","3720200"," Where you'd expect to see."
"3721040","3723740"," Major role specifically the SMP 500."
"3724720","3726200"," I would be wary of that. "
"3742060","3744580"," Like the like what are you expecting to the downside."
"3745320","3747060"," Normally we get a big role like this."
"3747080","3749900"," It's like everything's maxed out rotation is done. "
"3749900","3750860"," We blast down."
"3751280","3752980"," We go into liquidation mode here."
"3754100","3756720"," And we go like we go to like plus twenty nineteen. "
"3757720","3760140"," We're like plus seventy here."
"3760680","3762140"," We get down to like thirty."
"3762560","3765600"," Get down to twenty one nineteen and then we boom slam down. "
"3765780","3767360"," You get up you get a you get a liquidation phase."
"3768960","3772000"," It looks more like you know like that grind sideways."
"3772160","3774300"," And then hopefully the rotation is done. "
"3774580","3776400"," Then you get the liquidation phase down the road."
"3776880","3777760"," It's like bearish."
"3778020","3778340"," Maybe. "
"3778860","3779980"," How long does it take."
"3780920","3781760"," A month."
"3782420","3782980"," Possibly. "
"3784820","3788340"," And even inside of that month you could still see that four thirty."
"3788700","3790560"," I was at four thirty two or something like that."
"3790820","3792300"," Even in that rotation trade. "
"3793160","3794180"," And they move down."
"3801910","3803670"," Perbell Tom is making a great point."
"3804790","3808090"," There's always a theta trade and the theta gang is looking for it. "
"3808130","3808750"," They're looking for a high."
"3808990","3811230"," They're looking for a low and they're looking to set up."
"3812330","3813990"," Condor or a fly fight to gas. "
"3814230","3814830"," That's what they're going to do."
"3815770","3816830"," That's my guess here."
"3820010","3821930"," Matter of fact if you're a theta trader. "
"3823330","3825590"," In chat of Twitch or YouTube."
"3825650","3828150"," If you're a theta gang guy or girl or whatever."
"3828890","3830390"," Do you see the theta trade. "
"3830590","3833890"," Am I crazy today to say on the open look for a theta trader."
"3837330","3840330"," If one of you guys that likes trading the fucking wheel or."
"3845900","3848100"," If you're a theta theta person. "
"3848200","3849960"," Do you see the sideways action or no."
"3851440","3853960"," Sideways and down to consolidate or even distribute."
"3854460","3855860"," Which is darth darth saying. "
"3856500","3858620"," It'll eventually we'll have a distribution moment."
"3860800","3865240"," Anybody out there like your theta gang out there watching this show right now."
"3866960","3870060"," Are you on the sideways and down trade. "
"3873540","3877360"," Yeah in July is blast the fuck off month right."
"3879920","3884160"," July is like rocket ship month like we trade sideways and down again in July."
"3884480","3885680"," We're some fucking faces off. "
"3889020","3890740"," Judas theta appreciate month."
"3893820","3894780"," The wheel."
"3895400","3902280"," I was watching a guy Wall Street that's had a cool post last night. "
"3902920","3905460"," There is a guy on there's a guy in Wall Street."
"3905540","3907740"," Somebody made a post of an interview with some guy and he was like."
"3908500","3910340"," I roll the spy every month. "
"3911500","3913240"," And people are ripping on him."
"3913620","3916780"," And I was like he's kind of right."
"3918380","3919660"," He's kind of right. "
"3920080","3925880"," I don't know if there's an interview a brief interview with like a like a fat old white guy who"
"3925880","3927140"," looks like he's done a ton of cocaine."
"3927900","3930380"," He's eating every fucking steak in every bar."
"3932280","3934200"," He's like sweating profusely. "
"3934400","3936920"," He's got the gel in his hair."
"3937080","3940120"," He's got the parted short haircut that everybody has in the barbershop."
"3941340","3943380"," And you could tell he was just like sweating profusely. "
"3944220","3948540"," And the guy who was interviewing was like an NFT bro that was trading the spy."
"3949000","3950460"," And of course he goes the spy."
"3951160","3954240"," So the guy looks hard like the kid looks as bad as the old man right. "
"3954900","3955600"," As a matter of fact."
"3956620","3957660"," The whole interview."
"3958240","3960780"," It was like a quick clip that was put on Wall Street Bets. "
"3961560","3965340"," The young guy reminded me of the old guy just the younger version of him."
"3966260","3967200"," To some extent."
"3967960","3968620"," Just the new version. "
"3970000","3971720"," The kid's like he's like kidding."
"3971760","3973360"," He was like probably 30 years old or something."
"3973560","3975980"," He's like fucking just roll the spy every month. "
"3976720","3977520"," It's like it take 50."
"3977700","3979660"," I think he said I buy a monthly contract."
"3981020","3985280"," And as soon as I'm up 50% I sell it for profit and then roll into the next month. "
"3987640","3991820"," He didn't really give the kid didn't really give the details."
"3993060","3994900"," The kid is right to some extent."
"3997700","4001920"," He didn't say he didn't expand and say I took the money and I ran. "
"4002400","4005180"," I waited until the monthly low came in and I reentered."
"4005840","4008040"," The other thing that the kid didn't say was."
"4008900","4012580"," In a bear market you usually get listen closely. "
"4013460","4015700"," Six to seven of those a year."
"4016300","4021780"," In a bull market you get somewhere between nine to eleven of those a year."
"4022180","4023600"," So of course Wall Street Bets is like. "
"4024320","4025680"," Check check check check check check check."
"4025960","4028900"," If he did this every month and you ran the numbers it wouldn't work."
"4030500","4034820"," I doubt that kid is just like entering and exiting. "
"4035500","4037600"," He's more than likely looking for a monthly low."
"4038740","4041420"," And it doesn't happen every month but you can see it."
"4041900","4042640"," You can see it. "
"4042880","4044680"," If it doesn't happen you can actually see it."
"4045200","4046840"," So the kid was right to some extent."
"4047320","4048440"," He didn't expand upon it. "
"4048440","4049700"," He was just throwing it out there like."
"4050420","4051880"," I roll a fucking spy call."
"4052620","4053940"," And it's pretty easy. "
"4054320","4056580"," And I was like he kind of is to an extent."
"4058080","4060300"," And this is likely what you're looking for."
"4060460","4062920"," So that post that was made on Wall Street Bets yesterday. "
"4062920","4065900"," He's probably exited his rule."
"4066540","4071400"," And he's now looking for that next entry."
"4071740","4072960"," Looking for that consolidation. "
"4074280","4078540"," He propped that kid on that kid on that little post on Wall Street Bets."
"4079300","4082540"," That kid is probably like I could give a fine fuck if we go to 432."
"4083840","4085460"," I'm just looking for that next entry. "
"4086660","4088780"," When does that next entry present itself."
"4088780","4091560"," And for me as a bull."
"4091840","4092760"," I know it's not here. "
"4092820","4093820"," Even if we go there."
"4094260","4095359"," Even if we go to 432."
"4095880","4097479"," That's not my entry from here to 432. "
"4098240","4102760"," My entry is looking for that nice sweet sweet green."
"4103500","4105580"," Velocity dip by and you just go boom."
"4105920","4107439"," I'm in and I'm not sweating. "
"4111000","4111600"," Yeah, yeah."
"4111779","4112620"," That's so you saw right."
"4112800","4113200"," Parable time. "
"4113800","4115620"," Just roll and roll and roll and roll."
"4115899","4116160"," Heat."
"4117380","4120260"," So I don't know if it was because of he was being in. "
"4120399","4121240"," So when you're being interviewed."
"4122359","4124500"," You sometimes keep it short and sweet."
"4125620","4127279"," He might have been under pressure. "
"4127620","4128819"," The two of them were like sweating."
"4129380","4131600"," You know, they got the lights and the camera on them."
"4131819","4133319"," Wherever they were, whatever they were doing. "
"4134319","4135660"," The kid has a point."
"4137399","4138580"," The kid has a point."
"4139520","4141800"," It's not exactly what the kid was saying. "
"4142479","4143359"," I call him a kid."
"4143520","4144760"," He's probably a grown man."
"4145600","4147580"," But the guy, the young guy is right. "
"4147779","4149340"," The young guy to an extent is right."
"4149500","4151120"," Even in a bear market guy is right."
"4152100","4156620"," If the opportunity does not present itself enough or as much as it does in a full market. "
"4158040","4159960"," Normally you only get like in a bear market."
"4159960","4163240"," You get like six or seven somewhere in there."
"4165540","4167680"," And sometimes you miss the trade. "
"4170680","4174859"," Sometimes you miss the trade because your rules are not met."
"4175460","4177260"," But I bet that it's not that simple."
"4177819","4179160"," I know they were making fun of that guy. "
"4179399","4182359"," But that guy, if you're like, find out what that guy is doing."
"4183600","4185740"," I guarantee he's got a guarantee."
"4185979","4188420"," If he went to the details of it, he was just short and sweet. "
"4189120","4190880"," Just roll a spy call every month."
"4192300","4193580"," It's fairly accurate."
"4193580","4200980"," I can assure you it's not accurate, but it's not far off from what people do. "
"4202980","4205380"," Yeah, just roll and roll and roll."
"4205600","4205660"," Boom."
"4205920","4207160"," Make twelve hundred fifty percent. "
"4208160","4209480"," That guy is somewhat correct."
"4211380","4213200"," I'm going to defend that kid to some extent."
"4218060","4224890"," Yeah, I like the rainbow. "
"4226790","4227710"," Find a high."
"4229110","4234670"," Grab yourself some ratios or something in case we start blasting off and you get caught."
"4246530","4249230"," I wouldn't be holding just puts though either. "
"4250130","4250850"," I guess you could."
"4251210","4252670"," I guess that's the same role, right?"
"4252790","4255030"," I guess that's the same thing if you were a bear."
"4255610","4257530"," You buy like a month out put or something. "
"4257950","4258430"," Fifty delta."
"4258670","4260230"," I think that's the kid said by fifty delta."
"4260230","4262070"," I can't remember. "
"4262530","4263650"," He's like close to in the money."
"4272960","4276920"," Tony Cheese saying zoom announced some AI shit today."
"4277240","4283480"," I love everybody just because. "
"4284180","4287520"," Yeah, this company just did some more AI shit or just lied again."
"4288460","4289700"," Nobody cares, right?"
"4291520","4297320"," Oh, you got AI too?"
"4298860","4300700"," Even the bulls are like, oh, you got AI?"
"4309900","4310500"," Think tight."
"4310680","4312240"," I got to do some stuff here in the background. "
"4312420","4313360"," I got some crap to do here."
"4317600","4319100"," Sideways into the right for theta gang."
"4346930","4349070"," I'm reading some of Twitter right now. "
"4357580","4358620"," We're just saying here."
"4365190","4367130"," Saudi, yeah, the oil oil was big."
"4367310","4367770"," Oh, wait a minute. "
"4367770","4369390"," We're finally getting the green index up."
"4369550","4369790"," Sweet."
"4370810","4371710"," We're finally max. "
"4371990","4372210"," We're at."
"4372490","4373690"," So finally we're at."
"4376350","4377850"," We're getting pretty good here. "
"4377910","4378950"," We're not quite there yet."
"4382990","4387070"," We're getting everybody always ask me to always show this on screen."
"4393910","4395030"," So fair and greed. "
"4395550","4396630"," Greeds at seventy three."
"4397710","4399330"," Not quite at one hundred yet."
"4401310","4403970"," Looks like we've got a little bit of a rotation trade. "
"4404210","4405690"," Probably we can probably get some."
"4405890","4408270"," Probably get really greedy here if we really want to."
"4408470","4408930"," Oh, shit. "
"4412130","4414610"," We're not like max green right now."
"4416430","4419910"," We're not at like pigs get slaughtered just yet."
"4422630","4424530"," I'm assuming that's at four forty. "
"4434410","4441060"," Yeah, no shit, dude."
"4447760","4449040"," No, that ain't shit."
"4449860","4450700"," That ain't greed. "
"4453900","4455340"," That ain't fucking greed."
"4455620","4458260"," If we were up there, if we had like a hundred max green, it'd be like sell it all."
"4458880","4459240"," Sell everything. "
"4463460","4469980"," Oh, yeah, zoom party with my former team at AWS for call analytics."
"4477120","4477920"," Oh, yeah."
"4478300","4479040"," So I got to have it. "
"4479280","4481620"," So you guys, I'm not taking any payments right now."
"4481620","4482720"," If you guys are trying to sign up."
"4485820","4489700"," We are making those decisions in the next couple days here. "
"4490380","4491640"," What the member levels will be."
"4491800","4493020"," They'll always be a free option."
"4494240","4495160"," So you'll always have. "
"4495400","4500640"," I want you to know that they'll always be an option where there'll be a room or two available on"
"4500640","4501560"," discord that's free."
"4502440","4504760"," You'll always have a live stream that's free."
"4506160","4507140"," That kind of stuff. "
"4507780","4511440"," There are people out there that though that I want you to know that."
"4511440","4514960"," You may not know this, but a lot of people in our stream."
"4516140","4518920"," Are either professionals or retired professionals. "
"4519620","4526960"," A lot of people are serious trainers and they want to be able to do this on their own to"
"4526960","4527340"," some extent."
"4528180","4529560"," They have their own favorite tickers."
"4530020","4532400"," All that kind of stuff and they want to follow along. "
"4532680","4538500"," So it will get data based upon whatever that chick costs."
"4538500","4540220"," We're going to have to charge for that."
"4541580","4542640"," See all different levels. "
"4542880","4543600"," Be like, I want this."
"4543720","4544340"," I don't want that."
"4544460","4544820"," I want this. "
"4544940","4545360"," I want that."
"4545680","4546300"," I don't need this."
"4547540","4552180"," We've got an education class inside the discord that's free right now. "
"4552780","4555460"," But that stuff costs money to put together time effort."
"4556600","4559960"," We've got futures traders that take what their trade."
"4560100","4561480"," They make their living off this stuff. "
"4563360","4567520"," All that stuff takes time, money and experience to produce."
"4568040","4569840"," It will be available for you if you want it."
"4571980","4574040"," We've got moderators, admins, all that kind of stuff. "
"4574680","4576760"," We're going to work on monetizing that."
"4576920","4579200"," There will always be a free option for you as the key."
"4579980","4582240"," If you're always like, oh, am I going to get locked out of this?"
"4582680","4582840"," No. "
"4583600","4584500"," You'll never get locked out."
"4585680","4592580"," But if you need or want more data driven and more exacting."
"4593200","4594780"," You're like, hey, Cap, can you check Tesla?"
"4595080","4595520"," That's one thing. "
"4595620","4597160"," But if you're like, all I do is trade Tesla."
"4598860","4601660"," You want the white papers and find out what this means?"
"4601780","4602260"," What that means?"
"4603160","4610840"," If you're making money, dude, if you're making money, there's been no problem for that."
"4610840","4613240"," That audience is here, so they all know who they are. "
"4621080","4622180"," Hey, David, how are you doing, man?"
"4625080","4625900"," David, how are you doing, brother?"
"4627640","4629520"," Yeah, man, that's what I think, David."
"4629860","4631780"," I think we're a consolidating, brother."
"4632600","4635660"," By the way, how's your fail?"
"4635920","4636900"," I want to ask in stream. "
"4637680","4638720"," I'll contact you privately."
"4639960","4642740"," Are you trading this garbage the next couple of days or no?"
"4642740","4644240"," You're looking for that break above and hold?"
"4656490","4657870"," Yeah, he's getting beach time today."
"4658310","4660410"," That should tell you all you need to know. "
"4661490","4665850"," If David is saying, I'm going to go to the beach, that should tell you everything you need to know"
"4665850","4666090"," here."
"4669770","4671390"," I'm going to assume that they're in agreement."
"4677010","4677810"," Okay, check. "
"4677910","4678550"," So far."
"4678990","4680510"," Let me look at it in the background real quick."
"4682750","4684110"," I can check so far for you. "
"4684710","4688050"," I am going to leave the stream on for you today."
"4688410","4691330"," I have to do some stuff in the background for you guys."
"4692130","4693770"," I don't have a choice here. "
"4694110","4694750"," Let me get a second here."
"4694770","4695430"," I'll look at so far."
"4707310","4708150"," So far. "
"4709950","4711170"," Consolidating back down."
"4711170","4711970"," Look for."
"4714890","4715910"," It's still bullish. "
"4717790","4721350"," See what the reaction is."
"4721430","4730290"," It's 702 7.02. It can still run."
"4732230","4733270"," I personally. "
"4734190","4735210"," Here, we'll do it right now."
"4736150","4737610"," I'll bring the trap so you can see it."
"4738290","4738950"," Give you a better. "
"4739790","4742110"," You know, like I guess to know something."
"4742390","4743690"," So if you guys."
"4744710","4745230"," Have. "
"4745530","4747690"," I'm going to be asked about so far right now."
"4749010","4753330"," This is like a so if you let's say you just trade so far or let's say you just trade"
"4753330","4755130"," Tesla or our PLTR."
"4756390","4756870"," GME. "
"4757730","4760150"," If you were to just have if you have this tool and you."
"4760490","4762310"," Have a list of 100 stocks."
"4762990","4766510"," You don't have to be only trading one ticker. "
"4766630","4769170"," There's no nothing against so far."
"4770490","4772970"," But this so far is a good example."
"4773610","4775110"," Right now where it is. "
"4775110","4777130"," It's a really good example."
"4781190","4782150"," Of checking."
"4784010","4785450"," It's like let's look at so far. "
"4788810","4792930"," So so far is velocity deli velocity is like maxing out right now."
"4794230","4796130"," Like where do I like to buy so far."
"4798630","4800150"," I like to buy it down here. "
"4800150","4806070"," I like to buy it when the early is coming up right deli velocity like low on the deli velocity"
"4806070","4807290"," low on the early velocity."
"4807990","4809290"," I like this move."
"4810030","4812370"," Like this is the move that I like on so far. "
"4814410","4814890"," Right."
"4815190","4820610"," So this is awesome sauce and did the first question that I have for you is."
"4821010","4822490"," Did you catch this move. "
"4825730","4829070"," If your answer is no I bought in here or I bought in here."
"4830610","4831870"," Then you're not happy."
"4832770","4834730"," If you bought it down here you're stoked. "
"4835630","4837410"," You're like woo hoo I made money I'm out."
"4837710","4839370"," I'm going to go smoke a doobie."
"4840090","4840850"," Find a girl. "
"4841290","4841750"," Whatever it is."
"4841910","4842250"," Find a guy."
"4842610","4842890"," I don't care. "
"4843090","4843670"," Whatever you're doing."
"4844370","4844510"," Right."
"4844710","4845430"," So this is like happiness. "
"4847930","4850390"," So if this is the move that you caught down here."
"4851070","4852950"," You'd want to catch that move again."
"4853470","4856810"," I'm assuming that some of you are like when does this move happen again. "
"4858770","4860050"," Is it going to happen right now."
"4860730","4861230"," I don't know."
"4861690","4862310"," I could. "
"4863730","4865630"," I likely don't want to buy that move."
"4865930","4867610"," I always want to buy like this move."
"4869270","4871110"," I want to buy that one that one. "
"4871110","4871970"," I want to buy this one."
"4871970","4874570"," So if I can."
"4876070","4877750"," Trade from its hourly. "
"4878730","4879830"," That's seven oh two."
"4880430","4880950"," Can."
"4882170","4884250"," Seven oh one seven oh two somewhere in there. "
"4885030","4886170"," But I'll be honest with you."
"4886890","4889470"," This is why you have like a stable of stocks."
"4891330","4894710"," Because I'm trying to catch like the ones that are blasting right. "
"4895470","4896810"," Trying to catch a move."
"4898090","4900010"," And if so far I could do a move."
"4900490","4901150"," I'm not anti. "
"4901710","4905010"," I'm not anti so far trading its channel all the way up."
"4905150","4906010"," I'm not against that."
"4910890","4913670"," Oh but to me the move has been made. "
"4913990","4914670"," I'll be honest with you."
"4914770","4915890"," The move to me is made."
"4935430","4939570"," Five ninety five six forty two six ninety four seven forty nine. "
"4943950","4946330"," I'm going to expect a week of consolidation at minimum."
"4948090","4949070"," That's what I'm expecting."
"4950010","4951730"," And I would check back personally. "
"4952870","4954790"," Now you might want this trade here."
"4955550","4956750"," You might want that trade."
"4959590","4961850"," Maybe like we're going we're going a twenty one. "
"4962130","4963210"," Sure we can do that."
"4963610","4967270"," I'm not interested in I'm interested in buying that big dip for the big move higher."
"4968010","4970870"," So if I was going to trade so if I."
"4972590","4975630"," I'm looking more for something like this. "
"4979650","4981650"," And then that larger move higher."
"4983550","4985430"," So I'm looking for the daily to come up."
"4988190","4993350"," I'm looking for the hourly to come down and I'm looking for consolidation down here. "
"4994170","4995550"," And then that leg higher."
"4995550","4998310"," So I'm looking to buy six forty two personally."
"4998710","5000410"," Now if I missed this trade up here. "
"5002550","5004090"," I'm fine with this in that trade."
"5004250","5004990"," I don't need that trade."
"5005190","5008050"," I don't I don't need like sixty cents on so far. "
"5008650","5012510"," I need like I need or want the trade on so far."
"5012510","5013130"," That is."
"5015490","5017350"," You know six forty two to. "
"5020730","5021570"," Nine bucks."
"5021830","5025250"," I want to like thirty percent mover on so fine."
"5025590","5027950"," So you can take this trade. "
"5028050","5029830"," I get that you guys want to is it bullish?"
"5031370","5031990"," It's bullish."
"5033310","5034350"," When does it get there?"
"5035110","5036170"," I don't really care."
"5036350","5042190"," I care more about having the velocity that I need the consolidation that I need and the price that"
"5042190","5042470"," I need. "
"5042890","5044690"," And I don't want to get locked into this trade either."
"5046190","5051060"," I don't want to like load up and get caught."
"5054410","5056230"," If we come up here. "
"5057110","5058590"," We come up here right."
"5059190","5060750"," We start to consolidate down."
"5061850","5067010"," I'd rather be buying here with a stop underneath than have bought here. "
"5067950","5070310"," And be getting rolled past my stops."
"5071290","5075410"," Right I bought here at seven bucks then it's down here."
"5076430","5083230"," Right and now you're at six forty two and then boom we break lower you panic cell and you're all"
"5083230","5083730"," fucked up. "
"5083870","5087190"," You just lost a bunch of money and then it comes back up again right."
"5088310","5090210"," So reaction matters."
"5091290","5095330"," Reaction matters on so far stops matter on so far. "
"5097490","5101190"," Maybe try to buy seven bucks with a stop underneath."
"5103090","5105330"," Six forty two is where I think it is."
"5106830","5111470"," And you don't want to trade sideways for some time do you want to get trapped in here either do"
"5111470","5111610"," you. "
"5112650","5113910"," You get trapped in that kind of nonsense."
"5115310","5116370"," Then you get your move."
"5119790","5121250"," So it's not a buy for me. "
"5138710","5139110"," Yep."
"5140710","5142070"," Good to see you David."
"5144230","5145530"," Yeah I got a couple. "
"5146650","5147990"," I traded this right here Dave."
"5150490","5152690"," Traded that open right there and then I got out."
"5153390","5154710"," I didn't take that one. "
"5158100","5159800"," Looking for a range here man."
"5161400","5186380"," Ping pong"
"5186380","5188160"," ping pong ping pong ping pong ping."
"5205340","5206840"," I'm going to put this on auto. "
"5216800","5219060"," I'm going to take some I have to make some phone calls."
"5219260","5221020"," I'm going to be here with you this morning."
"5223480","5227480"," If we get to many major breaks to the upside or downside. "
"5232420","5235180"," You need to get those call buyers to step in here."
"5235720","5237660"," Start loading the fuck to the upside."
"5256740","5258060"," You want to look at IWM. "
"5264700","5274340"," B.W.M. is juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy juicy"
"5274340","5277140"," juicy juicy to the upside."
"5279780","5281340"," Juicy to the upside."
"5311250","5312430"," See this right here. "
"5315190","5316450"," There's my cursor right there."
"5316550","5316830"," See that?"
"5319890","5321010"," See all that right there?"
"5326720","5330060"," One difference here is we're on the weekly."
"5331920","5332800"," Solidate on the weekly. "
"5334100","5338020"," We got this daily just coming up here like raging hard on right there."
"5341740","5343660"," Just a matter of time, right?"
"5360540","5364620"," Big buy right where we are on IWM."
"5365080","5365400"," Big buy. "
"5367880","5370380"," Any and every dip to the downside."
"5372500","5379140"," Smart money at 176.06, dumb money."
"5381520","5383100"," And there's a trap here too. "
"5386460","5388580"," There's a trap right here."
"5394990","5395830"," For bulls."
"5403560","5406260"," Make that red for yellow. "
"5407000","5408260"," Trap right there for bulls."
"5431180","5433880"," Very bullish over 180."
"5436060","5437380"," Very bullish over 180. "
"5487840","5490700"," I'd really like one brief moment of going down."
"5490980","5492740"," Sorry for how fucked up my lines look right now."
"5500970","5508190"," Target above 186.27. I'd really like to buy the 176 maybe. "
"5509650","5511390"," 178, anything in here?"
"5521030","5521940"," Leave that right there."
"5522800","5524740"," 178, 176."
"5526600","5529800"," 178, 177, if that happens. "
"5530600","5538200"," If we get above at any point, 179.80. Long, 287 with a stop underneath."
"5542900","5544660"," You know when we first break up."
"5545260","5546860"," So what happens is this. "
"5548080","5551060"," When we make the first initial move, we break above the weekly."
"5551920","5553180"," It's called a kiss trade."
"5554180","5555700"," Can we come back and kiss it?"
"5556740","5557180"," Just like that. "
"5559740","5563260"," And you want to see the move higher."
"5564600","5566360"," You do not want to see that fail."
"5568120","5571400"," So the move to me, the rotation to me is into 187. "
"5573060","5574560"," Have some stops down below."
"5575580","5582560"," If it begins to revert, come underneath and slam down as an attempt, and then you get the actual"
"5582560","5583060"," move higher."
"5584760","5585620"," Anything above 180?"
"5588930","5593290"," Well, the kiss trade is setting up right now to make the move higher. "
"5594970","5596610"," Right now we're trading above 179."
"5598570","5603090"," We need to get above 180 basically."
"5604210","5609550"," If this 180 gets going, you can stay long to 187. "
"5610410","5614810"," Or one, excuse me, it's 186, 185."
"5615210","5616610"," Let's call 185 for right now."
"5618090","5619650"," Yeah, get ahead of myself here. "
"5619990","5620670"," Let's call 185."
"5621930","5622210"," Play it safe."
"5625070","5626770"," 25, 186, somewhere in here. "
"5631160","5632480"," As long as you're above 180."
"5637860","5639940"," You do not want to reject this, though."
"5640060","5642720"," If you're sorry, rejecting this, we're going down to consolidate some more. "
"5644880","5646220"," I like the IWM trade."
"5699860","5727910"," Good morning,"
"5727930","5728150"," everybody."
"5728610","5729870"," OK, so I'm going to take a break here. "
"5730090","5733290"," You guys know where we're trading above."
"5734410","5737070"," You guys know, or to me, it's a consolidation day."
"5737450","5739910"," Consolidate, consolidate, consolidate, consolidate. "
"5740530","5744190"," We can get above here."
"5744410","5746050"," We're going to try to attack this 430."
"5746110","5750190"," 79 for the SPX caller, JPM caller above. "
"5751140","5756550"," We've got another target above here, R2, right here."
"5756970","5759230"," We've got another one up here, R3 at 434."
"5808080","5810180"," You're ready to take the IWM trade, finally. "
"5811180","5816860"," Above 180, have stops below, targeting 185."
"5819620","5826800"," I would really like to buy it at 177, 178, personally, but I'm still pretty bullish on IWM right"
"5826800","5832600"," now, that trade into DIA and portions of the SPY."
"5833360","5836640"," Matter of fact, how is that XLU looking right now?"
"5837600","5839960"," Are they still getting a dip buy right now?"
"5846260","5847480"," They had to buy off the bell. "
"5848960","5852260"," XLU's got a gap down below it, 6509 to fill."
"5860550","5864550"," 6509 to fill a gap on XLU."
"5872200","5873240"," All right, so give me just a minute. "
"5873280","5874080"," I've got to make some phone calls."
"5875360","5877600"," And I will be back with you guys in just a minute here."
"5878540","5885220"," If there's any kind of like major shift up or down that shows something other than consolidation,"
"5887180","5889520"," then I'll jump in with you guys at some point. "
"5891880","5898940"," Yeah, XLU should come down and close, 6519 to 6508."
"5905650","5907470"," Look at USO in the background, too."
"5909190","5910410"," Yeah, USO, man. "
"5910410","5911910"," Just keeps plugging along, dude."
"5913190","5916530"," USO, man, with a low on 31st, just keeps getting bought."
"5918470","5920690"," Look at US, any oil traders out there. "
"5920790","5922370"," Let me see if I can see anything on oil for you."
"5925930","5928370"," Dude, oh, man, USO, dude."
"5930270","5932210"," It's kind of wild to see USO here. "
"5933310","5934670"," USO is about to get pretty volatile."
"5938070","5942830"," USO might do really well with a right where we are currently."
"5943030","5950010"," At 64, 65 might do very well with a straddle, a close-in straddle. "
"5952850","5966280"," USO is about to get violent here, 24th, like"
"5966280","5966840"," a month out."
"5967780","5969540"," Month out USO straddle would be nice."
"5971680","5973960"," Whatever direction it picks, pull the other side. "
"5981610","5982450"," All right, I'll be back."
"5986020","5987500"," I'll put something on for you in the background."
"5987720","5990460"," I'm going to put the voice of reason on. "
"6002050","6003550"," Nothing on the T-bill so far."
"6007160","6008540"," We haven't had our crash yet."
"6008740","6028260"," Dude, a T-bill treasury auction. "
"6029800","6031620"," Find anything hard right now on that."
"6033660","6041600"," In desperate bid for cash, the treasury is auctioning one-day bills, desperate."
"6042480","6045780"," You got to love it. "
"6048340","6050440"," Desperate bid for cash."
"6056320","6059220"," Desperate bid for cash."
"6074190","6075680"," Yeah, Rudy, you haven't signed. "
"6075680","6077120"," I made a good point today."
"6078140","6081780"," He said everybody's freaking out over the upcoming T-sections, T-bill auctions."
"6082320","6086100"," If only there was a group of some money fairies that could buy up all the supply using magic beans"
"6086100","6088480"," or keystrokes or something. "
"6088820","6089440"," That's the fact."
"6089700","6090400"," They're going to do that."
"6090580","6094940"," In North West Europe, that plus $3 a barrel to ice brand settlements. "
"6095740","6096340"," That's a fact."
"6096620","6104020"," If you know the actual mechanics of the treasury bill actions, we never left QE in those auctions."
"6104020","6104960"," And we won't. "
"6107120","6114760"," For all the QT that they're doing from the Fed, the Treasury Department is like, what we never"
"6114760","6115160"," left."
"6116620","6118160"," We show up every day."
"6128720","6130500"," Now, if they didn't show up, it would be fucked. "
"6130900","6134840"," But we'd be uber duper super fucked."
"6136880","6138840"," So, we're coming to a Ramco, Saudi Arabia."
"6138840","6145440"," That's the July Arab light crude oil OSP to the United States at plus $7.15 a barrel. "
"6145560","6146540"," Yeah, this is the mantra."
"6147000","6149260"," So, I'm reading another post from somebody else they said."
"6150160","6157540"," Well, now that the Senate passed a limit deal in Biden's side into law, US Treasury is expected to"
"6157540","6161160"," offer 173 billion short-term tables at auction today. "
"6162780","6164360"," Dixie is up right now."
"6164660","6166480"," But here's the question that everybody poses."
"6167020","6168620"," It's always like that person in the back. "
"6169520","6172900"," We're going to fucking burn tires in New York City or some shit like that."
"6173860","6176480"," What will happen to liquidity in the market?"
"6176900","6185980"," Truth is that Fed is moving back to, in my view, supporting the market"
"6185980","6192060"," only when it needs to, and not destroying the market."
"6193320","6195100"," So, it's like this weird balance. "
"6195820","6199800"," It's like the 50s, 60s, and early 70s."
"6202360","6204200"," So, are they going to create a crash?"
"6204740","6205140"," Probably not."
"6206400","6209120"," Are they going to rip faces off of the liquidity?"
"6209360","6209940"," Probably not. "
"6225670","6230330"," Someone else saying that this is the risk of narrative currently that the tea bowl auction later"
"6230330","6230770"," today."
"6231850","6233630"," Yeah, I don't know, man."
"6234170","6234930"," I don't know. "
"6235910","6239690"," I think if the market goes down due to it, then you're going to see a pause in rates."
"6251780","6253340"," Yeah, that's all I can see right now."
"6253400","6254200"," No panic out there. "
"6254360","6264830"," So, yeah, it doesn't matter if there's, there's like, so, Jenny Marcus released, oh"
"6264830","6265990"," boy."
"6266270","6270090"," Some time last year or the year before, not Jedi."
"6270470","6277090"," He didn't release, but the Fed released the mechanics of how they would run these auctions. "
"6279630","6283110"," And he got like five likes on the post."
"6285070","6286390"," Like zero traction."
"6288390","6294630"," But if you actually clicked on it through the Fed, and then you went into the details of how the"
"6294630","6303510"," auctions would be run, no one's going to want to talk about it because they didn't basically, they"
"6303510","6307530"," said, we're going to remove liquidity from the system. "
"6310330","6317570"," And if no one shows up to take that off the books, we're going to warehouse that shit over here"
"6317570","6321050"," and claim that it was removed from the system."
"6322170","6332130"," It's very similar to, it's very similar to when the U.S. says, what is the"
"6332130","6335930"," U.S. will say something like, we haven't balanced or but the budget."
"6336770","6337810"," So, this is a great one. "
"6338030","6341550"," So, like the U.S. is like, we haven't balanced the budget."
"6342850","6344770"," We're spending more money than we have."
"6347630","6350810"," And so, that creates, you know, a vol. "
"6351510","6358510"," And then, of course, they come back later and like, if I'm president, if I'm this, if I'm that, I"
"6358510","6360210"," will balance the budget, I promise."
"6360850","6367370"," So, of course, all the people on Main Street are like, yes, spending's out of control."
"6368170","6369390"," Balance that budget. "
"6371110","6374970"," The reality is, they're kicking the can down the road."
"6374970","6379710"," They balance the budget and they find ways to pay for all the debt."
"6379970","6384030"," They intake on new debt and they kick the can down the road. "
"6386430","6392190"," And that's very similar to what they're doing with some of this liquidity that they're removing"
"6392190","6392890"," from the system."
"6393730","6399290"," So, like, you're seeing some of it being removed, and then parts of it is getting warehoused until"
"6399290","6402330"," they find more buyers in a future date."
"6402670","6405310"," Though, in the books, it looks like it's removed. "
"6409450","6413950"," I'm telling you, dude, you guys got to read some of this shit in the background, like the details"
"6413950","6415210"," of what they're doing."
"6415770","6416850"," It's fucking wild."
"6424790","6426210"," It's absolutely wild. "
"6431540","6435360"," So, it's like, and that was, and then the funny part was, right?"
"6435700","6436760"," No one read all that shit."
"6436760","6444720"," And then when we had the regional banking crisis, we had the regional bank crisis, the Fed, the"
"6444720","6447320"," Fed, the Treasury, where it's like, we didn't create any money."
"6448260","6450460"," And I'm like, I know you warehoused it. "
"6450880","6452800"," And then you pulled it back out when you needed it."
"6453320","6454160"," I know what you did."
"6454940","6456820"," And then people were like, that's not printing money. "
"6456920","6459240"," I'm like, well, you know, invariably it is."
"6460160","6465740"," We can, we can, uh, we can fucking, we can call whatever we want, right?"
"6465740","6471240"," But we know, I mean, it's not printing money, but it's, they already printed it, but it was off to"
"6471240","6472060"," the side, right?"
"6473120","6474980"," And then they reintroduced it again."
"6476520","6484640"," So, you know, it's like, uh, it's like apples and crab apples. "
"6487760","6490800"," We're like, we're like, we're like mixing, we're like mixing hairs."
"6491220","6492840"," I don't know what that's, we're splitting hairs."
"6494720","6497700"," You know, like I said, it's like a sell side wants to sell sides. "
"6498000","6504060"," Like we split hairs, we want to split hairs, and then we don't split hairs when we don't want to"
"6504060","6505960"," split hairs to get a message across."
"6506440","6508220"," Not necessarily what's going to happen."
"6508840","6509880"," Just a message, right?"

"11065310","11071070"," trades and stuff like some scalping and stuff like that but outside of that for me as a as a"
"11071070","11079910"," trader I'm not interested and I'm also looking for above here even if we have that break above we"
"11079910","11082770"," squeeze above I'm still again looking for that consolidation. "
"11083930","11090150"," I'm looking for the catch up over here I'm still looking for this just like downside over here for"
"11090150","11091030"," me to take that long."
"11091430","11098090"," They work so well that I've got no business you know."
"11099210","11103210"," Individual tickers we called out some of those earlier today they seem to be doing quite well at"
"11103210","11103570"," this point. "
"11104530","11108670"," So if you're if you have any questions at the moment in chat if you want to ask them I"
"11108670","11110650"," got five minutes of take a quick break here."
"11112410","11113470"," The credit low is invested."
"11114070","11115810"," My best guess is the S breaks 4305. "
"11116630","11118270"," We just get stuck in that shop anyway."
"11118590","11121330"," Anyway I prefer a nice dip into midweek to find more buyers."
"11122070","11125910"," Yeah I career low I see that happen and I see that squeeze higher than that good consolidation"
"11125910","11126410"," sideways. "
"11131760","11134860"," So that's the tool you guys are getting to base tool."
"11135000","11135660"," It's not the whole tool."
"11136620","11139060"," It's part of the tool that you're getting from us. "
"11139740","11144220"," I still have access to it as well and you'll know which you guys get it to."
"11144380","11150300"," It would be cool because you'll have you'll understand a lot of where I come from where I'm like"
"11150300","11151600"," yeah we're doing this we're doing that."
"11155110","11160330"," And career low is basically saying we grind up here smash above hold it start that consolidation"
"11160330","11160810"," down. "
"11160950","11162530"," But for me personally like can we go there?"
"11162730","11163710"," Yeah can I get cut up in here?"
"11164110","11164210"," Definitely."
"11164530","11168290"," It's kind of where bulls start giving money away with shop."
"11169250","11172170"," I'm looking at 429 C's right. "
"11173090","11177590"," They're 70 cents but they were at like 60 cents all morning."
"11178830","11182330"," So like I'm making 10% on a 0-8 in here."
"11183410","11185950"," Like to be exposed all day long. "
"11187210","11189470"," I'm like fuck you and you're 10% I don't need it."
"11189550","11194130"," I'll tell you I want 300% I want 200% I want 100% I want the market moving"
"11194130","11195170"," where it's going."
"11196050","11198810"," So for me personally I have no interest in it. "
"11201350","11205290"," I was saying if we break that 4305 level cap not come in so we will though."
"11205530","11206830"," Yeah it's not enough for me."
"11207070","11211270"," Like this if we get up here this is not enough for me to take the trade. "
"11212290","11216030"," If we break if we squeeze up here and come back down it's not enough for me to put the"
"11216030","11216470"," risk on."
"11217070","11218310"," Not with size at least."
"11225700","11227360"," I think it actually makes more sense. "
"11227740","11229380"," Yeah yeah I think I think there's traps there."
"11229460","11229840"," Two men."
"11230000","11231380"," I think there's swift reversals here. "
"11231940","11236180"," I think there's like it's all full traps all full like just this right here."
"11236180","11237520"," Watch this right come back up here."
"11238480","11242180"," Lead down check the five we know we're going higher so we get a high right. "
"11242880","11250100"," We had a PT2 here earlier but it stills like draining options off as it goes up there."
"11250280","11253380"," So just for me I got I got no wants."
"11254120","11258560"," I guess if you were trading futures not a bad trade to go to the upside but at least the"
"11258560","11262420"," zero dates one dates I got no no wants here. "
"11266110","11271090"," And I wouldn't be shocked with a swift reversal like the auto sell red red bar style."
"11271890","11274570"," I think it's like this is a fucking minefield for me."
"11278260","11279740"," It's a full on minefield. "
"11282060","11283500"," Yeah Disney was a great trade."
"11285540","11288380"," What do I think about I don't have any in a Q3."
"11289260","11295620"," Dude I'll tell you what man these earnings are not these earnings are not what bears want to see"
"11295620","11297560"," right there's a few few things here. "
"11299040","11301880"," These bears don't want to see these earnings not bears."
"11302300","11308840"," I use bears as a as a these bears as a heel right like you guys watch like wrestling as"
"11308840","11309120"," a kid."
"11310200","11316440"," If you watch the NBA now you got good guys and you got bad guys right. "
"11317100","11320780"," And they're not really bad guys are good guys but as soon as the matches over their friends."
"11322600","11328600"," And but outside of that as a heel right like who are the bad guys who are the good guys."
"11329000","11330840"," You know who wants to see the market crash. "
"11330840","11332300"," You want to see the market go to all-time eyes."
"11333760","11334980"," You don't want to see."
"11337200","11345980"," It's like two or three jobs. "
"11345980","11347500"," You want to talk about unemployment here all the time."
"11348620","11349100"," And."
"11353170","11354790"," You want to see job destruction. "
"11355950","11357210"," And no jobs."
"11357650","11360550"," No no need for for job replacement right."
"11361130","11363270"," You want to see the unemployment rate rising. "
"11364210","11369650"," And you want to also see companies saying we're not hiring this is in mass."
"11371130","11372890"," And you want to see people out of work."
"11372890","11377390"," I don't care if you work two jobs I don't care if you work three jobs I don't care. "
"11378050","11385010"," If you if you're $300,000 job is now $150,000 job or your $150,000 job is now $90 "
"11385010","11385810",",000 job."
"11386530","11390570"," I don't care if you get laid off from Apple and you you play you then have another opportunity."
"11391990","11395590"," Somewhere to work for $90,000 or 70,000. "
"11395590","11404610"," And I don't care if you get cut from your $150,000 tech job and you're now on unemployment, but"
"11404610","11405970"," your benefits haven't run out."
"11406250","11411370"," And you're like, yeah, I'm going to fuck off until I get another job, because there is demand for"
"11411370","11411610"," jobs."
"11412490","11417830"," That's like the, it's not the place that you're looking for on sell side for the crash. "
"11418910","11423290"," You're looking for, I got fired from a $300,000 job."
"11424090","11425670"," I burned through all my unemployment."
"11426910","11429550"," There's no $150,000 job for me. "
"11429610","11431610"," There's no $70,000 job for me."
"11431930","11436390"," I can't work two jobs to pay off my credit, pay off my mortgage."
"11436910","11438070"," I'm starting to miss payments. "
"11438990","11439990"," I'm about to go bankrupt."
"11441110","11444610"," That's what you're looking for, like that back end of it."
"11445610","11446670"," Looking for high unemployment. "
"11447570","11453630"," Looking for also unemployment benefits running out for these people."
"11454290","11458890"," You're looking for no jobs for them to come and get, even a second job."
"11459690","11466550"," You literally want people to be losing their wives, losing their husbands, losing their kids,"
"11466850","11467870"," losing their fucking dogs. "
"11468990","11476630"," You want to be coming out of your house on a Sunday for a Saturday to mow your lawn or"
"11476630","11482690"," not hearing landscaping companies mowing everybody's lawn in your neighborhood."
"11483650","11488290"," And you want to see the mail piling up outside because they're gone, right?"
"11488890","11490050"," And the houses are unoccupied."
"11490410","11496910"," That's the kind of shit you're looking for for the death crash or something in the market. "
"11497170","11498770"," So unemployment's like a big key to this."
"11500030","11501390"," We're not seeing that, right?"
"11501650","11502710"," Not yet, we're not seeing that."
"11504910","11506270"," We're not seeing it. "
"11506610","11508170"," And that's a problem."
"11508970","11510190"," That's a fucking problem."
"11513110","11520090"," The second part of this, the second part of this, that's an issue, is earnings. "
"11520910","11522150"," So I was being asked about IWM."
"11522510","11524250"," We have earnings season, right, for IWM right now."
"11525530","11530090"," And the second part of this is you're not seeing the full collapse of companies. "
"11530750","11535170"," You're not seeing spec growth declaring bankruptcy every week, right?"
"11535950","11536730"," Do we see any of that news?"
"11537230","11539350"," I mean, if we had it, they'd push it, right?"
"11540050","11546450"," If you saw like 10 companies a week, Peton type companies just like rolling up shop and closing,"
"11546750","11547170"," they're not."
"11548870","11556070"," So if you have a decent earnings season, they should run that up into their next earnings season,"
"11556270","11556390"," right?"
"11557230","11563470"," We also saw spec growth get, it's fascinating is a lot of these spec growth companies that I list"
"11563470","11565870"," to you, the ones that I call out to you."
"11566270","11568710"," And I tell you, hey, do you do diligence on these companies?"
"11568710","11577530"," If you go back and look at these spec growth companies that I'm pointing out to you, they were high"
"11577530","11583550"," fires for COVID plays and everybody got caught up in those plays, right?"
"11584750","11592030"," But if you look at their earnings reports and their guidance, going back to when they got chopped"
"11592030","11598170"," in December of 2020 into 2021, they were repriced. "
"11599270","11607010"," Their earnings and guidance were a reset for future growth, right?"
"11607910","11613110"," And these companies make real products as in this demand for them still."
"11613330","11619070"," So I don't point out Peton to you, but what I say to you, like, hey, this one company over"
"11619070","11622410"," here, this isn't a company that's trading at high multiples."
"11622410","11625510"," They're not making you promises on things that they haven't delivered. "
"11625990","11628370"," I do all the due diligence on these companies that I say to you."
"11628550","11631030"," Like, these are companies that are like, we make something real."
"11632150","11639150"," We were high flying, we got chopped, and we're now coming back again, and everything is like the"
"11639150","11640790"," goggles are off in these companies, right?"
"11640950","11641850"," The bear goggles are off. "
"11642650","11646090"," And you're seeing that they're flying again, well, from their new valuations."
"11647150","11649070"," We're not seeing these companies declare bankruptcy."
"11649990","11652290"," Coming into their earnings season and they're saying, yeah, we're doing great. "
"11653470","11655250"," We're saying we're making a product."
"11656050","11658610"," Our sales are going up at a more normal clip."
"11662250","11665750"," So not seeing that, right, is caution. "
"11666150","11668630"," It lends me caution for a market crash."
"11669510","11676350"," We can have like a momentary crash over a course of a month that comes right back, though, like"
"11676350","11680810"," that last leg you're talking about, or I'm talking about, hey, I want to see that last leg down."
"11682470","11689210"," Even if we get it, it's probably not the one that like lasts three or four out of five years. "
"11689310","11693850"," You know, that sideways, that you're in the trough, and you're looking for the last leg down."
"11694450","11695990"," What I already talked about, right, is like you bought the dip."
"11698010","11701830"," So when you're looking for that, like some of the signs in the background aren't saying it's going"
"11701830","11702210"," to happen. "
"11703090","11708190"," As a matter of fact, if you're along this market and we do get some kind of a major move"
"11708190","11713330"," down, all signs point towards you just holding until it bounces back."
"11713750","11715450"," A lot of the major reprising has been done."
"11716350","11717830"," Commercial real estate hasn't. "
"11718370","11720690"," There's some other sectors that are coming down the pike as well."
"11721730","11726770"," But like the S&P 500, whatever down that is."
"11726950","11731790"," This is how it candid and productive discussions with Chinese counterparts according to the State"
"11731790","11732230"," Department. "
"11733450","11735930"," Something that's easily hedged with a ratio spread."
"11736330","11737910"," Something where it'll likely pop back."
"11739730","11741670"," We're talking about that down, right?"
"11742110","11746230"," That last leg is always where market rolls over. "
"11746370","11747310"," It goes down hard and heavy."
"11747510","11748350"," It gets real deep."
"11749230","11751050"," And you see major reprising everywhere. "
"11752010","11757850"," And you see destruction in our economy that lasts a year, two, three years."
"11758750","11761350"," That last leg trade that everybody wants to see happen."
"11761350","11765430"," We're not seeing the things that you need to see for that to happen right now. "
"11765710","11766890"," It's going to happen down the road."
"11767030","11767130"," Yeah."
"11767650","11772230"," It takes Reich allows you to actually hear water flame futures, forex and stock instruments. "
"11772550","11772870"," They can."
"11773090","11773870"," It just isn't today."
"11774590","11775390"," Reich.com."
"11776250","11777670"," They really fucked us, man. "
"11777790","11779670"," They really, they're regional bank shit, man."
"11779770","11782850"," That was the regional bank shit."
"11782970","11785630"," For me at least, that was the thing where I was like, damn it, they did it. "
"11786510","11788670"," I was like, or at least for now they did it."
"11790630","11794730"," The regional bank thing really fucked up, bank thing really fucked over our cycles."
"11795690","11796990"," And they, they, we have a set. "
"11797290","11800250"," We have that hidden psych, that hidden COVID cycle still playing out."
"11810320","11811800"," Now you make it nasty in summer."
"11812740","11814320"," Do you know, I'd be careful of July. "
"11814560","11822020"," I'd be, I'd be careful of June being like consolidation and temper your expectations for a down"
"11822020","11822300"," move."
"11823620","11824260"," You will get it."
"11824420","11826340"," It's just, it's just going to be just like me. "
"11826860","11830260"," I was like, we're going to sell a may, temper your expectations."
"11830880","11833780"," We got some good selling may to an individual tickers, right?"
"11833880","11836100"," We got some really nice down shit going on in May."
"11836500","11838520"," It didn't show itself in the spy, right?"
"11839520","11842840"," And you're not going to expect that in the spy either again in June. "
"11842880","11844080"," You'll like to expect that low."
"11844760","11849420"," You'll expect more trimming as we exit sectors in June."
"11850780","11852620"," But you're going to expect it to get bought. "
"11853140","11854800"," Or I am at least unless something changes."
"11854800","11856400"," You guys know what to look for."
"11857180","11861120"," You guys know all about, I should have shown you in previous streams. "
"11862900","11868000"," For the proof that we are actually going to get a crash."
"11869020","11870700"," What to look for if that happens."
"11871660","11876840"," They, they, they, they show themselves crystal clear as day when it went and if they do happen. "
"11881120","11882340"," Tesla seems bullish."
"11882780","11883440"," It is, but."
"11885420","11887140"," For me, Tesla needs to pull back. "
"11888620","11890020"," Or I want it to pull back."
"11890460","11891460"," We called Tesla earlier."
"11891880","11894380"," So it's been, it's been a few weeks, two or three weeks. "
"11895320","11896760"," I'm sure there's going to be some profit taken."
"11897100","11898780"," It's a good solidation for them."
"11898980","11901260"," For that actual move to 300 to happen or 350. "
"11902440","11903480"," It's going to take some time."
"11905860","11906320"," I don't know."
"11906760","11907440"," Going back to I don't know. "
"11907540","11907940"," I'm really quick."
"11911200","11912220"," Let's take a look at it."
"11918350","11919910"," This is all positive to see. "
"11920210","11922870"," Like everything that's happening right now with IBM is positive to the upside."
"11923370","11923970"," We had a test."
"11924990","11929570"," We had the kiss trade take place on the open this morning, which is really nice to see. "
"11929770","11930910"," We got a nice bounce here."
"11933910","11937890"," Target above 187 to the upside for IWM."
"11939250","11939970"," Love to see it. "
"11940910","11942890"," This is a great trade set up for the upside."
"11946490","11947390"," Love to see it."
"11947490","11948230"," Got above the hourly. "
"11948530","11950310"," We retested the hourly down at 180."
"11953150","11955430"," 179, 180 and we're heading higher right now."
"11955610","11957270"," So I like the 180 bounce. "
"11957990","11961210"," It's a kid's a perfect kiss trade set up to the upside."
"11961470","11963530"," We're likely rotating into some kind of IWM."
"11963810","11965310"," I haven't even looked at the IAA yet. "
"11965510","11968590"," But I'm assuming the same thing is happening over there."
"11969490","11970830"," Same kind of a thing, man."
"11971630","11972070"," DIA. "
"11972410","11972770"," Same thing."
"11972770","11973810"," Nice rotation trade."
"11974750","11976210"," And then look at NDX. "
"11978390","11979390"," NDX, just trade."
"11979570","11979990"," NDQ."
"11980330","11981150"," That's NDQ. "
"11983350","11983830"," NDX."
"11989080","11990240"," NDX holding up nicely."
"11990440","11990960"," Trading sideways. "
"11992300","11992640"," Just grinding."
"11994100","11995040"," IWM trade, man."
"11995240","11995680"," Beautiful trade. "
"12004080","12004820"," I'm looking at it."
"12005020","12006240"," So you guys can't see this here."
"12006240","12012200"," I've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. "
"12012340","12015360"," I've got ten screens that you can't see in the background."
"12016460","12019300"," You can see on your end you're seeing one, two screens."
"12020240","12022920"," I have another eight screens going in the background. "
"12028340","12029180"," Yeah, you're right."
"12029340","12031700"," I have to talk about the Wyckoff."
"12033960","12034720"," Well, that talk. "
"12035120","12036400"," We talked about Wyckoff."
"12036880","12040460"," I have to do an overlay, which I have not done yet."
"12040840","12046540"," But I just have to do it on a, I'm going to do an overlay, remove a background on Photoshop,"
"12047640","12053080"," and then overlay it for you so that you can see even the most bearish. "
"12053740","12062120"," Even the most bearish outcomes here have us trying to close the gaps above at minimum."
"12062980","12065320"," And then rolling back over."
"12066080","12071100"," And the other one would be where we actually make all-time highs. "
"12071360","12073840"," And that's every diagram for the Wyckoff scenario."
"12074300","12080660"," So if you're a Wyckoff kind of person and there's another caveat to this, as long as we stay in"
"12080660","12090600"," that channel where we're closing those gaps or ATH, that's still a valid"
"12090600","12092060"," trade to the upside."
"12092960","12097280"," So unless we start seeing that roll, this should take place and happen. "
"12098780","12101460"," But I will do the overlay with you guys this week."
"12102200","12103220"," I can't do it right at the moment."
"12103320","12107820"," I'm trying to do some discord crap and some membership stuff. "
"12108220","12114840"," I got to do a bunch of like secret things or like secret codes and secret keys and that kind"
"12114840","12115100"," of stuff."
"12115100","12118060"," So just keep trading the day away as you like it."
"12118440","12121060"," If you guys keep talking in the chat. "
"12121220","12125020"," If you guys see something trending, mention it inside the chat."
"12125220","12130100"," If you guys see something that's selling, ready to sell, say something in the chat for your fellow"
"12130100","12131660"," sellers out there."
"12133560","12136300"," But NDX grinding, spy grinding. "
"12136660","12137320"," I don't know if it looks great."
"12138660","12143640"," Personally for me, Tesla, I'm not interested at the moment I get that you're interested."
"12143640","12145300"," I'll take a look at it real quick here. "
"12147080","12149740"," Yeah, I like the Tesla consolidation trade."
"12149960","12153540"," It's waiting for the hourly to come up for continuation of the upside."
"12154040","12156040"," I still would like a dip buy on. "
"12157120","12159900"," I would still like one more dip buy on Tesla, believe it or not."
"12160920","12167420"," But the sideways trade consolidate and move higher trade is here for Tesla to trade."
"12168480","12169100"," You ready?"
"12171000","12173280"," Jesus 300 to 350, bros. "
"12176400","12177640"," Nice call spread."
"12178560","12180280"," Make it three to six months out."
"12180920","12182700"," Sit back, relax, enjoy your summer. "
"12185080","12192720"," I got people in the background calling me FaceTiming me with a video of every vacation everybody's"
"12192720","12193280"," on right now."
"12193280","12194320"," I want you to know that too."
"12195060","12197000"," There's a bunch of bulls out there, right?"
"12197000","12198640"," And I was sailing this weekend. "
"12199920","12202560"," There was a beautiful island this weekend."
"12202740","12203900"," It was up to the wife and the kids."
"12204960","12206020"," Oh, and one more thing. "
"12206260","12207360"," I took the kids up for pizza."
"12207960","12210700"," Someone tipped me $69 on Friday or something."
"12211480","12212240"," I didn't take pictures. "
"12212620","12213220"," Oh, maybe I did."
"12213360","12213640"," I don't know."
"12214080","12220700"," But it's funny because we had a chance to sail to a pizza burger joint. "
"12221860","12225920"," And we're like living off the boat and I'm like, we don't have to do that."
"12225920","12230480"," I was like, I can get us onto this dock and we'll lead some pizza and burgers."
"12230780","12234320"," And the wife and kids felt like I was cheating. "
"12234740","12235620"," And I was like, we ain't cheating."
"12236620","12238160"," I was like, the only time reading that."
"12239180","12240920"," Eating that boat food is when we have to. "
"12242440","12244420"," I got my, I got friends."
"12244720","12245240"," Everybody's on vacation."
"12245540","12246300"," A winky's on vacation. "
"12247660","12249760"," Joe Donut is down in."
"12250880","12251320"," Nice."
"12251320","12252060"," Not my ruba. "
"12252060","12257280"," I think we use an aruba and Joe Donut is somewhere in Mexico."
"12258420","12260720"," I'm not going to say exactly where you probably just want people to know."
"12260940","12263900"," But he's down in Mexico at a nice resort as well. "
"12264100","12266340"," They're all like face out of me, sending me pictures."
"12266880","12269340"," And so there are people on vacation right now."
"12270000","12274440"," There's some bulls out there that are just kind of like, yeah, wait until it's ready for me to jump"
"12274440","12274660"," in. "
"12280200","12284960"," Yeah, if you're already long on Tesla, I mean, if you're already long on Tesla, this trade was."
"12288120","12289080"," This trade was."
"12291420","12292800"," No, let's see what it was. "
"12293700","12294820"," What did that trade start?"
"12298100","12299760"," Or at least for me, when did it start?"
"12300220","12304520"," I don't know what it started for you, but the Tesla trade started."
"12307420","12308240"," For me."
"12324380","12325860"," All each leg, of course. "
"12328940","12329640"," Oh, there."
"12350860","12351680"," Oh, shit."
"12351840","12353860"," You know what's happening in my background is I've got a."
"12354520","12359240"," I think it might be deleting my posts here. "
"12359700","12361700"," Oh, that's fascinating."
"12363620","12364320"," That's cool."
"12365200","12367860"," I've got a scratch where I just said to. "
"12369460","12371200"," So I'm changing."
"12371660","12372400"," I'm changing James."
"12372780","12374900"," The handle is changing right now. "
"12375580","12381460"," So I've got a delete tweet bot in the background that's slowly leading all of my tweet history on"
"12381460","12388340"," Twitter because that handle is going to switch over to specific like a new handle."
"12389780","12390700"," Pass name."
"12391140","12391480"," Okay. "
"12407140","12408780"," Just the grind right now."
"12428080","12431380"," So I'm looking at a mark is right now."
"12434740","12435740"," Look at his. "
"12436000","12438940"," Look at his post today."
"12449270","12454030"," Mac 10 says we're approaching a new bull market in the S&P 500."
"12471510","12481020"," I can see all the trainers are like I can see all the trainers are like I"
"12481020","12483780"," can see all the trainers like I want a better entry. "
"12484320","12485060"," Me too."
"12488960","12489640"," They agree."
"12505540","12506480"," And look at Lily. "
"12506780","12508820"," Yeah, look at Lily."
"12509400","12510420"," No, I'll why."
"12524950","12526630"," I'm not saying to come up here in the background. "
"12545140","12546060"," Oh, yeah, okay."
"12546700","12547160"," Let's take it here."
"12549900","12550800"," Look at it. "
"12556280","12557900"," Trend is your friend on it."
"12560180","12562520"," Next buy in 4 4 1 3 4."
"12563020","12569240"," If you're already long price started the upside retesting the previous high at 4 54."
"12571160","12572320"," I wouldn't buy it here. "
"12579780","12582300"," Like right now at this moment, I wouldn't buy it."
"12582420","12583880"," I'll be looking to take profit here."
"12587100","12589840"," Possibly go back up and test that 4 4 41. "
"12591420","12596200"," Gazzy to show me more tickers that are rolling over or bottoming."
"12597300","12601540"," Like show me a ticker call it a ticker that's rolling over or bottoming."
"12605570","12607690"," Should would I take a trade here on this one?"
"12607910","12608010"," No. "
"12609710","12611910"," I would have taken it at 4 41 0 2."
"12612910","12614750"," Oh, but I personally wouldn't take a trade here."
"12616710","12619770"," Trading for 29 51."
"12623230","12625430"," I always like bottoms and tops. "
"12628010","12632430"," I always like when people come in and there's no offense to L.O.Y either."
"12632730","12633250"," I always like it."
"12633390","12639370"," I always prefer like something's rolling over and you're like, Hey, can you take a look at this"
"12639370","12639570"," one?"
"12639590","12641970"," Is it actually rolling or something where it's bottoming?"
"12644690","12645290"," No, sweet. "
"12645450","12646010"," They're actionable."
"12646650","12647850"," Now, maybe you're long that trade."
"12648070","12651770"," If you're long that trade, I'd be exiting soon. "
"12652370","12655970"," There's a little bit more at the top you can take 4 54 maybe."
"12656890","12661990"," Maybe you get up there and slap 4 55 4 60, but then I don't I still don't like it."
"12666090","12666930"," That's Eli Lilly. "
"12668690","12670370"," It's nothing I'd be interested in."
"12670510","12671350"," And that's not that."
"12675030","12676330"," Not a bad thing. "
"12676450","12676970"," Just just me."
"12683800","12684300"," Ooboh."
"12690770","12691910"," Traded that before too. "
"12693590","12694550"," Like this one."
"12696290","12697890"," Like this one a lot, actually."
"12700850","12702530"," Early right now, I like Bobo a ton. "
"12703550","12704990"," Just keep buying the hourly."
"12706510","12710290"," Bear in mind at the top of the hour, the Apple event is due to start."
"12710410","12713150"," We have posted the live video on the feed for all those interested. "
"12713630","12715070"," I'll put the Apple video on."
"12742660","12745460"," Something like a mixed reality had something that you would actually use."
"12746020","12747060"," And so we kind of see a lot. "
"12764330","12764850"," Excited."
"12781500","12783840"," I've got the Apple event on here in the background."
"12797250","12800150"," Any guys feel like Apple events or sell the news?"
"12800150","12801410"," I"
"12803240","12813960"," like"
"12820960","12822120"," Fubu here right now. "
"12822300","12825940"," I like it to 174 to 197."
"12826740","12831260"," And Fubu is getting quite bullish here."
"12831600","12835760"," They're trying to attack 239 and 315. "
"12835760","12842140"," Be fascinating to see if they announce a merger here, to be honest with you."
"12844100","12845920"," For the way that it's setting up here."
"12855240","12857880"," Fubu stops by the dip at 167. "
"12861440","12862320"," Sell the rip."
"12864440","12866720"," Or stops below 161."
"12867460","12871220"," First price tag at the upside, 199, but it's getting even more bullish. "
"12871980","12874120"," Keep buying that consolidation too."
"12875100","12879280"," Like that 211 down to 159 all the way back up two bucks."
"12879880","12881900"," And it should get an explosive move higher at some point. "
"12882580","12883080"," I like it."
"12883580","12884720"," I like owning it."
"12891040","12892620"," I'll look at Apple real quick. "
"12902180","12904160"," Oh, yeah, dude, Apple."
"12908760","12918090"," Fading 184.56. Just begging to target like 186 "
"12918090","12929430",".67. Anybody"
"12929430","12931450"," going to short the shit out of this event or no?"
"12938770","12940230"," Apple said, fuck your beer market."
"12940610","12942430"," I always like selling the news on Apple. "
"12945920","12948740"," But this one, I don't know if this is like the Apple car, right?"
"12951480","12956920"," This isn't like a services kind of a, or hey, we got a new iPhone or a new iWatch."
"12960450","12962410"," The VR headset should be."
"12967270","12972410"," Eventually get, you know, the key behind the VR head or Apple virtual reality is what does it"
"12972410","12972750"," become?"
"12974590","12975750"," What is it becoming implant?"
"12977070","12977970"," How long does it take?"
"12979550","12981150"," It gets to be two big ones. "
"12981870","12984690"," When does it become an implant and contact lenses?"
"12985530","12986850"," That's like really what you want."
"12987150","12988830"," And you really want to know that they're working on it."
"12989870","12991230"," Like that Apple garden. "
"12991710","12992490"," You know, you want that."
"12992690","12997050"," You want to know that Apple is going to have some contact lenses."
"12997050","12998170"," That's what they want, right?"
"13003510","13005170"," And that's ultimately it, right?"
"13005310","13007510"," Your phone gets implanted into your body. "
"13008650","13011410"," Or it's a wearable, like a wearable would work."
"13011570","13012110"," It was like a watch."
"13012110","13021950"," Think about it like if the watch became a wearable device and you could pop two contact lenses in"
"13021950","13027030"," and have AI and VR. "
"13027930","13029490"," It would be pretty fascinating."
"13030830","13032890"," And you probably want to hear something in your ear."
"13034270","13035590"," I don't know if that's an ear pod. "
"13035590","13041410"," But you"
"13041410","13049310"," have to get hooked up to your TX."
"13049310","13056490"," Hold on, I'm missing stuff."
"13073540","13076520"," PLTR trading $15.56 right now. "
"13076740","13077680"," Ooh doggy."
"13079000","13079880"," Palantir consult."
"13080200","13081440"," You know what fascinating is?"
"13081560","13083900"," This is exactly what we're looking for on. "
"13084960","13086800"," Let me show you PLTR right now."
"13089240","13090800"," So PLTR, right?"
"13091240","13094320"," This is pretty much what you're looking for on Apple or on Tesla."
"13094320","13098400"," So this is a very similar chart to Tesla. "
"13099560","13102760"," You see the break above, right?"
"13104020","13105100"," Consolidating on the monthly."
"13106020","13108340"," And here comes the daily back here."
"13108500","13111500"," Just screaming higher and you get the squeeze up. "
"13112320","13113920"," Very similar to Tesla."
"13114580","13117620"," Very, very similar to Tesla."
"13120230","13121510"," Congrats, Palantir. "
"13122510","13123110"," Palantir."
"13125190","13125650"," Palladium."
"13127610","13128070"," Paladines. "
"13137020","13139400"," Yeah, I don't understand the Vax question either."
"13139660","13144420"," I'm like, every time I hear someone say that I can vaccinate it, I'm like, they don't fucking"
"13144420","13144760"," travel."
"13145660","13148420"," They don't fucking travel anywhere. "
"13148620","13152840"," They're fucking, they either have committed a felony or they're poor."
"13154240","13154940"," I kid you not."
"13155080","13155800"," That's what I say to myself. "
"13156900","13161180"," They're like, the only people that I ever think that are not vaccinated are like pores."
"13162940","13165420"," Pores have a felony."

"13168460","13169200"," It's one of those."
"13170560","13173660"," Oh, I've never had a profession that requires a vaccination."
"13174040","13176980"," One of those, like four or five, they've hit one of those. "
"13179780","13185660"," Everybody else is like, everybody else is like, I had to get vaccinated for my job, my school, my"
"13185660","13186080"," travel."
"13187020","13188040"," I didn't have a choice."
"13191900","13192920"," Join the military. "
"13193500","13193740"," I don't know."
"13193920","13194680"," You pick it."
"13195100","13197660"," You pick it. "
"13199820","13200860"," It's true, right?"
"13202400","13203540"," So you know it's true."
"13203540","13203700"," It's true."
"13207760","13208400"," It's true. "
"13210480","13213040"," I never got the anti-vax question."
"13213340","13214200"," I was always like, what do you mean?"
"13214500","13215660"," Like, I want to go on a travel."
"13216080","13217920"," Of course I'm getting vaccinated. "
"13225410","13226910"," I'm never getting vaccinated."
"13227130","13229130"," I'm like, you've hit one of those things for me."
"13232310","13234350"," One of those five or six things. "
"13234630","13236010"," We didn't need a vaccination."
"13238890","13240150"," That's every vaccination."
"13245410","13246830"," I've been still vaccinated. "
"13247310","13247870"," It's not even funny."
"13249770","13254410"," The bad one for me was the, the bad one for me was the anthrax."
"13254850","13257110"," We got some shots for anthrax that were no fucking around. "
"13258010","13260470"," Got some pills and some shots for it."
"13263970","13266030"," And that's the one that scared the shit out of me."
"13268890","13270230"," They shoot you full of everything. "
"13270610","13271010"," Everywhere you go."
"13271170","13274230"," If you get any guys traveling, if you guys travel around the world, you know that you're getting"
"13274230","13274470"," shots."
"13275570","13277790"," Depending on where you travel to, you're getting even more shit. "
"13278490","13280550"," Pills, shots, doesn't matter."
"13288610","13290830"," Yeah, you're not traveling without your shots."
"13290830","13292870"," I apologize, but you're just not. "
"13293650","13295170"," You're not getting into any countries."
"13295610","13296970"," You're not getting back into our country."
"13297350","13298650"," That's another fascinating thing. "
"13299150","13301170"," So like in our country, we're like, we're not doing this."
"13301350","13305770"," And I'm like, do you realize how hard it is to get into the United States?"
"13306490","13307730"," Even just on vacation."
"13308210","13314430"," Like, we are one of the most difficult countries in the world to enter, even on vacation. "
"13315270","13319210"," And we're expensive if you're not from the US to travel to."
"13319210","13321270"," We're not like one of the fun countries."
"13321510","13326430"," We're fun to go to, but we're not like, you're not poor coming here in vacation. "
"13332010","13332910"," Good morning."
"13333570","13335270"," Welcome to WWDC."

"13536690","13542230"," It starts with a design that's astonishingly thin and light, yet feels incredibly solid and"
"13542230","13542550"," durable."
"13543360","13548990"," It's only 11.5 millimeters thin, making it a 15-inch laptop."
"13550010","13551610"," And it's easy to carry around. "
"13551870","13552830"," Yeah, it's going to hair, right?"
"13552970","13553810"," It's all you got to do is hair it."
"13553950","13557870"," It features magsafe charging, including midnight and starlight."
"13558330","13565390"," The Air has a brilliant liquid retina display with an expansive 15.3-inch screen that's surrounded"

"13735790","13741950"," And the 13-inch Air with M1 remains in the lineup at $9.99. So customers have more choices than"
"13741950","13744110"," ever to find the perfect air for them."
"13745550","13747350"," So that's MacBook Air."
"13748150","13750410"," Next, let's talk about our pro products. "
"13751170","13757110"," Earlier this year, we announced M2 Pro and M2 Max, along with the new MacBook Pro and Mac Mini."
"13757730","13759750"," And users have been amazed by their performance."
"13760850","13764730"," Well, now we have even more exciting news for pros, starting with Mac Studio. "
"13765770","13770850"," Introduced last year, Mac Studio is an entirely new product designed specifically for pros."
"13771490","13772190"," And it's been a breakthrough."
"13772990","13777210"," Users have been astonished by what they can do with it, and satisfaction is through the roof. "
"13777710","13783270"," They love that it puts tremendous performance and extensive connectivity in a compact form that"
"13783270","13784310"," lives right on their desk."
"13784970","13790110"," And you can already find it in the heart of hundreds of thousands of home and pro studios across"
"13790110","13790830"," the world."
"13791610","13795810"," Like at NBC, where they use it to deliver Saturday Night Live every week. "
"13796770","13800870"," And at Air Studios, where sound engineers use it to bring blockbuster movies to life."
"13801570","13806470"," And at Lux, where software developers rely on it to create cutting-edge apps like K-Life."
"13807610","13811050"," Today, we're excited to give Mac Studio its first big update. "
"13811730","13813110"," And here's Jennifer to tell you more."
"13816760","13820620"," Users love Mac Studio for its incredible performance and connectivity."
"13820620","13823420"," And today, both get even better. "
"13824340","13828580"," First, Mac Studio is getting the immensely capable M2 Macs."
"13828880","13830500"," And it's a performance powerhouse."
"13831500","13838700"," Developers can build new versions of apps at warp speed, with up to 25% faster performance than M1"
"13838700","13839200"," Macs. "
"13839760","13846320"," Motion graphics designers using After Effects can render up to 50% faster than M1 Macs."
"13846320","13853000"," Mac Studio with M2 Macs is also four times faster than the most powerful Intel-based iMac."
"13853940","13854900"," And that's not all. "
"13855500","13861620"," Today, we're adding one final chip to the M2 family, taking Mac performance to new heights."
"13862580","13864460"," Introducing M2 Ultra."
"13865320","13867040"," It is a monster of a chip. "
"13868160","13873840"," Connecting two M2 Macs die together with our groundbreaking ultra-fusion architecture, it doubles"
"13873840","13875780"," the performance of M2 Macs."
"13876500","13882260"," The 24-core CPU in M2 Ultra delivers 20% faster performance than M1 Ultra."
"13883260","13887660"," And its 76-core GPU is 30% faster than M1 Ultra. "
"13888600","13892780"," Finally, the 32-core neural engine is 40% faster."
"13893760","13902280"," And M2 Ultra can support an enormous 192 GB of unified memory, which is 50% more than M1 Ultra."
"13902920","13906160"," Enabling it to do things other chips just can't do. "
"13906800","13913280"," For example, in a single system, it can train massive ML workloads like large transformer models"
"13913280","13918820"," that the most powerful discrete GPU can't even process because it runs out of memory."
"13919580","13924380"," So that's M2 Ultra, our largest and most capable chip ever."
"13924380","13931860"," With a mighty CPU and GPU combined with massive memory bandwidth in a single SOC, it's the most"
"13931860","13935000"," powerful chip ever created for a personal computer. "
"13935860","13942180"," And today, we're bringing M2 Ultra to Mac Studio, taking performance even further."
"13943160","13950260"," Compared to Mac Studio with M1 Ultra, colorist using DaVinci Resolve will see up to 50% faster"
"13950260","13951520"," video processing than before."
"13951520","13956740"," 3D artists using Octane can now render up to three times faster. "
"13958160","13966040"," And with M2 Ultra's media engine, video editors can playback a mind-blowing 22 streams of 8K Pro"
"13966040","13966540"," Res video."
"13967460","13970400"," No other computer in the world comes close."
"13971360","13977900"," Mac Studio with M2 Ultra is also a whopping six times faster than the most powerful Intel-based"
"13977900","13978260"," iMac. "
"13979340","13984700"," M2 Macs and M2 Ultra take Mac Studio performance to a whole new level."
"13985520","13987240"," For example, melting up right now."
"13987320","13993560"," Now has higher bandwidth HDMI, enabling up to 8K resolution and 240Hz frame rates. "
"13994160","14001740"," And with M2 Ultra, it can support an incredible six Pro display XDRs, driving over 100 million"
"14001740","14002160"," pixels."
"14002160","14005160"," So that's the new Mac Studio."
"14005760","14010900"," It's a performance powerhouse, taking demanding workflows to the next level. "
"14011520","14012820"," And we're not done yet."
"14013400","14019600"," There are some Pro users who want ultimate performance, yet depend on internal PCI expansion as"
"14019600","14019780"," well."
"14020460","14026220"," Like audio engineers at Skywalker Sound, who work on feature films like Oscar winner Top Gun"
"14026220","14032940"," Maverick, where all at once. "
"14033700","14037780"," So today we're bringing Apple Silicon to one more Pro product."
"14038740","14041700"," Introducing Mac Pro with Apple Silicon."
"14043870","14049740"," It combines our most powerful chip with PCI expansion to tackle the most demanding workflows. "
"14050970","14056260"," First, every Mac Pro comes with the outrageous performance of M2 Ultra."
"14057200","14063620"," Compared to the fastest Intel-based Mac Pro, many real world Pro workflows, like video transcoding"
"14063620","14066800"," and 3D simulation, are three times faster."
"14067620","14074860"," A key reason is the amount of unified memory in M2 Ultra, which is up to a gigantic 192GB. "
"14075660","14082200"," It enables the new Mac Pro to do things simply not possible before, like render Disney's Moana"
"14082200","14085100"," Island scene with massive geometry and textures."
"14085100","14090420"," Another reason is M2 Ultra's media engine, which accelerates video processing."
"14091320","14097240"," The Intel-based Mac Pro does this using Afterburner, a card that can play three streams of 8K"
"14097240","14097980"," ProRes video. "
"14098620","14107060"," Now, every Mac Pro has Afterburner performance, built in, and not just one, but the performance of"
"14107060","14108580"," seven Afterburner cards."
"14109260","14109920"," It's incredible."
"14110960","14119960"," In fact, when using six video I.O. cards, Mac Pro can ingest 24 4K camera feeds and encode them"
"14119960","14123960"," to ProRes in real time, all on a single machine. "
"14124860","14131060"," And the wide array of advanced connectivity on Mac Pro gets even better with eight built-in"
"14131060","14135980"," Thunderbolt ports, six on the back and two on the top, which is twice as many as before."
"14136980","14140600"," Finally, Mac Pro brings PCI expansion to Apple Silicon."
"14141280","14147180"," It features six open expansion slots that support Gen 4, which is two times faster than before. "
"14148060","14154180"," So users can customize Mac Pro with essential cards, including audio and video I.O., networking,"
"14154860","14155180"," and storage."
"14156180","14159560"," Finally, it's available in both Tower and Rack Mountain closures."
"14160300","14162980"," 105 counter-parties take use, but one, three, one. "
"14163180","14163260"," So that's the new Mac Pro."
"14163360","14171300"," Nice role right here in the Spy, first one that we've experienced since 12.05. And the versatility"
"14171300","14176980"," of PCI expansion, it takes even the most demanding workflows to a whole new level."
"14177560","14178840"," Now, back to John. "
"14181080","14185860"," Today, we've announced not just one, but the two most powerful Macs we've ever made."

"14218100","14218820"," laptop experience."
"14219600","14220900"," And we're just getting started. "
"14221620","14225220"," For Intel-based Mac users, every Mac is now a gigantic upgrade."
"14226140","14230240"," And for PC users, there's never been a better time to switch to a Mac."
"14230760","14231580"," Now back to Tim. "
"14233640","14240220"," With Apple Silicon, it's remarkable how far we've taken the Mac in such a short amount of time."
"14241050","14247220"," It's the best and most capable lineup in the history of the personal computer, and I couldn't be"
"14247220","14248860"," more excited about its future."
"14249640","14255820"," And it's the integration of our hardware and software that brings our amazing products to life. "
"14256880","14262760"," Our software platforms enable our developers to do their amazing work, as well as providing"
"14262760","14264960"," incredible experiences for our users."
"14266380","14270380"," So to tell you what's new with our software platforms, here's Craig."
"14280650","14282610"," Let's start with iOS. "
"14283450","14289330"," This year, we looked across the entire iPhone experience to provide delightful new features that"
"14289330","14292650"," make the things you do on iPhone more personal and intuitive."
"14293290","14295570"," Our next release, iOS 17."
"14295870","14297070"," Apple now with a rule over. "
"14297350","14297910"," Communication."
"14298850","14301650"," Simplified sharing, more intelligent input."
"14305090","14310530"," Let's begin with some major updates to three apps that are central to how you communicate with"
"14310530","14311830"," people every day. "
"14312350","14314930"," Phone, FaceTime, and Messages."
"14315950","14318570"," The phone app is essential to the iPhone experience."
"14319510","14325470"," Some of our most special moments start with a phone call, and we're making a big update to the"
"14325470","14326350"," phone app this year. "
"14326810","14332630"," First, we're giving you a brand new way to express yourself with personalized contact posters."
"14333690","14337530"," You get to customize exactly how you're represented when you give people a call."
"14338070","14344570"," Contact posters feature beautiful treatments for both photos and emoji paired with eye-catching"
"14344570","14345290"," typography. "
"14345970","14350550"," And in Chinese and Japanese, the new layout with vertical text looks incredible."
"14351550","14354850"," This rich new visual identity doesn't just show up in calls."
"14355410","14360970"," It's also part of your contact card, so you'll have a consistent look across the places where you"
"14360970","14362390"," communicate and share. "
"14363290","14365170"," With posters, you're in control."
"14365970","14369690"," Customizing your poster works a lot like personalizing your lock screen."
"14370510","14373870"," Decide on the image, font, and color. "
"14375510","14377470"," And look at some puts right now."
"14378690","14384790"," Whether they're from your neighbor, your friend, or your boss, they're going to stand out in a"
"14384790","14385750"," whole new way."
"14385750","14389130"," And for developers, this all works with call kit. "
"14389810","14393710"," So posters will appear for calls placed via third party VoIP apps too."
"14394670","14397390"," Next, we have a powerful new feature to help you make."
"14397470","14399250"," I'm going to add some 4.27s here. "
"14399390","14405450"," I haven't pulled the trigger on them, but I'm watching Vix in the background here."
"14406890","14409670"," It's hard to know whether it's one you want to pick up."
"14409690","14413410"," We're offering up 4.28 to 18 cents. "
"14413410","14418890"," So 4.27s were like 50 deltas just a moment to go."
"14419090","14421230"," They flipped up the 30 deltas are somewhere in there."
"14421410","14425270"," Not really paying attention to the delta, but kind of imagining that that's where they are. "
"14427250","14428750"," 4.27s right down here."
"14428910","14430890"," They want me to buy 18 cent puts."
"14431550","14432930"," Or if it can wait. "
"14433070","14435250"," I don't really want to pay 18 cents for them."
"14435510","14436770"," Right on your screen."
"14437230","14439990"," So you can decide where to take the call. "
"14439990","14442530"," Thanks to the power of the neural engine."
"14443050","14444610"," Live voicemail transcriptions."
"14444690","14445870"," That's how it always is, right?"
"14446490","14447650"," Preserving your privacy. "
"14448630","14451250"," And there's another type of call getting a big update."
"14452130","14452650"," FaceTime."
"14453270","14456450"," Where we've added one of our most requested communication features. "
"14457190","14459730"," Now when you call someone on FaceTime and they aren't."
"14459790","14461250"," I want the 4.27 piece."
"14463070","14464410"," For 7 cents. "
"14465150","14467970"," They're like hey come get some of these puts for 18 cents."
"14467970","14469770"," And I'm like yeah I don't know man."
"14471290","14471770"," Next. "
"14472070","14475910"," To tell you about some updates to another way we love to share and communicate every day."
"14476530","14477130"," Here's Kim."
"14480070","14481650"," Messages is the way we say. "
"14481750","14483450"," Kind of the first time we're looking at a roll here."
"14483570","14485810"," I don't know if we'll see if this plays itself out."
"14485930","14488990"," I'm really looking for a cross verse before I enter a trade. "
"14491070","14493630"," First search is more powerful and precise."
"14493830","14496350"," I want to see like that roll down."
"14496350","14501890"," So now you can start a search and then add additional terms to narrow the results to find exactly"
"14501890","14502930"," what you're looking for. "
"14503130","14506910"," I want to see a liquidity grab in the top right of your conversation."
"14507270","14508550"," Let's you jump to the first message."
"14508810","14510270"," Failure to get a new high right in here. "
"14510510","14511850"," Perfect on busy days when the group chat."
"14512010","14512890"," Start red bar it down."
"14513390","14513950"," See if we can get it. "
"14513950","14515410"," We've also made replying in line."
"14515590","14516870"," Sell the news on Apple maybe."
"14517150","14518550"," Swipe to reply on any bubble. "
"14519370","14523270"," And for those times when you get an audio message but you aren't able to listen right away."
"14523670","14524990"," They're now transcribed."
"14524990","14527410"," So you can read them in the moment and listen later. "
"14527770","14529850"," They're not wanting to pay for 27s."
"14529910","14531190"," They're like it's seven cents."
"14531410","14532390"," We're not going down there. "
"14532490","14533550"," In the conversation."
"14534510","14539010"," Next I'd like to share an important new feature for those situations where you want to let a loved"
"14539010","14540650"," one know you made it back home safely."
"14541210","14541950"," Check in. "
"14542490","14547090"," Whether you're walking home after dark or going for an early morning run you can start check in"
"14547090","14550490"," with a family member or friend to let them know when you get home safely."
"14551190","14555790"," As soon as you arrive check in automatically detects that your home and lets your friend know."
"14556250","14558630"," But if something on Excel the news balls. "

"14560990","14563350"," Towards your destination and check in with you."
"14563690","14564790"," And if you don't respond. "
"14565110","14566250"," Sell the Apple event."
"14567170","14569230"," Your current location and the route you took."
"14569590","14574730"," You'll also be able to see your battery level and cell service status so they know if you might be"
"14574730","14575570"," able to take their call. "
"14576230","14579750"," And any information shared with your friend is end-to-end of your life."
"14579750","14580830"," Vic's looking bullish here."
"14581770","14584650"," We do recur that your loved ones have your back. "
"14585570","14589290"," We also have an updated design for how you get all your iMessage apps."
"14589830","14594390"," They used to live above your keyboard and now they are gracefully tucked away giving you"
"14594390","14594390"," conversations."
"14594730","14600410"," With just a tab you'll see all the things you say. "
"14600830","14604670"," Like a photo of audioscripts and users of the Q&A."
"14604810","14607610"," And when you swipe up you'll see all your iMessage apps there too."
"14608270","14610830"," Also inside this menu you will see a lot of is something you are going to love. "
"14611290","14613010"," A brand new stickers experience."
"14613830","14614670"," Let me show it to you."
"14615950","14623150"," By tapping the plus button and then tapping stickers, you'll see the brand new drawer that brings"
"14623150","14626470"," all my stickers into one place, like my recently used stickers. "
"14626770","14629570"," You don't care about your fucking emojis and your stickers."
"14632830","14635330"," I can peel and stick an emoji sticker."
"14635830","14636730"," Oh, here we go. "
"14637210","14638970"," And I can root the apple garden."
"14642130","14646250"," Last year, we introduced the ability to lift a subject from the background of your photos."
"14646570","14648490"," And now those subjects can be..."
"14648490","14649970"," Tell them about how the phone gets old. "
"14650290","14652010"," You're going to limit their batteries."
"14653130","14653690"," Tell them that part."
"14653910","14655730"," All the stickers I've made with my own photos. "
"14656750","14658290"," Let me show you how I made these."

"14718860","14722780"," And I want hookers in the garden. "
"14725420","14730520"," Every time I imagine the apple garden, I'm always thinking like, it's like when you walk by a"

"14735340","14735680"," a gate."

"14739020","14740140"," of like shit-based."

"15230750","15232690"," Let's see what you got to say inside the chat. "
"15235050","15240950"," No, I think a nice target down below is 427 right here, PT1 right here."
"15243650","15246390"," And PT2 down here, 427 is nice."
"15246390","15251570"," Puts aren't built for you to be trading them like calls, I'll be honest with you. "
"15253270","15256910"," 50 deltas, 30 deltas on the way OTM."
"15257290","15259350"," Way OTM puts, they can print."
"15260510","15267950"," They're not, like, puts were never designed for you to buy OTM put. "
"15268050","15268570"," Well, they are."
"15269070","15270850"," If you're looking for crash puts, they're great."
"15271690","15273670"," Penny puts are great for crash puts. "
"15276670","15280030"," They're not built for you to be running them all day long."
"15280330","15283210"," So 50 deltas are kind of nice."
"15284370","15285530"," 30 deltas are better. "
"15288090","15293250"," There's also here, you're going to get a check right now on this yellow line for more downside."
"15293970","15296130"," You got another check above at 428 86."
"15296130","15299230"," It's not like calls, man. "
"15304100","15306440"," Yeah, they don't believe me when I do this."
"15307860","15312360"," I'm supposed to be, they don't think I can take a putter or a short or something."
"15312540","15312940"," I don't know why. "
"15316950","15319550"," Have a pull cross right now on the VIX."
"15320010","15324190"," You want to see 1491 hold for the next leg lower."
"15327110","15330010"," Yeah, I got a winky out here saying the spy bounces off 426. "
"15331010","15332350"," You know, we can go lower."
"15333410","15335010"," The question isn't can we go lower?"
"15335090","15338130"," The question is, you want to be able to make some money, right?"
"15338550","15346610"," You don't want to be like, anyway, it's not a conversation for right now to explain the mechanics"
"15346610","15347190"," of a putter."
"15352720","15354280"," Hold on, I'm trying to take a peek at something. "
"15359740","15360740"," Fuckin' sell the news."
"15360980","15366840"," My only other fear here is like they, Apple then jumps into the AI BR bullshit."
"15369680","15373800"," Like surprise, like so any of you guys are new traders, I want to tell you something. "
"15375280","15376920"," Back in the fucking day, right?"
"15379640","15381260"," Back in the day, right?"
"15382300","15385040"," You get like, this would be like a perfect back in the day setup."
"15388380","15392980"," You'd see like Apple starts selling off, sell the news, sell the news, sell the news."
"15393260","15395040"," We'd be fucking bearish as fuck, right?"
"15395260","15396640"," Just sell it, sell it, sell it. "
"15398240","15403260"," And then right at the end of the live stream, they'd be like, okay, we're done with the live"
"15403260","15403540"," stream."
"15403600","15405580"," And they'd be like, oh, and one more thing."
"15407600","15413160"," And right when they said that one more thing, they would ram it right up your ass. "
"15413580","15417280"," They'd be like, oh, by the way, we have one more thing for you."
"15417960","15419340"," And then they would drop the hammer."
"15420100","15422400"," And the market would go fucking vertical straight up. "
"15423080","15424340"," We haven't had that in a while."
"15425280","15428080"," That's when they break the news of an Apple car or some shit."
"15430480","15432860"," And you'd get totally fucking demolished. "
"15434300","15435720"," Does any of you guys remember this shit?"
"15435860","15437220"," I used to trade Apple all the time."
"15437680","15442520"," They haven't done it, in my view they haven't done it in years, but they used to back in the"
"15442520","15442760"," day."
"15442920","15446200"," They would come out with just like one more fucking thing, man. "
"15447320","15448500"," Oh, and one more thing."
"15448720","15448820"," Yeah."
"15448900","15449820"," Do you guys remember that shit?"
"15452400","15455140"," And there was like a time when you'd be like flinching. "
"15455180","15458700"," I can't short sell the news on Apple because you'll never know and they're going to come out with"
"15458700","15459220"," something new."
"15460180","15461480"," Hookers and blow, baby."
"15462740","15466620"," Now in the secret garden, we're letting in anyone with hookers and blow. "
"15466620","15468260"," And you'd be like fuck."
"15479270","15480210"," Oh, man."
"15481810","15482730"," Too funny. "
"15490970","15492530"," Yeah, everybody was offside."
"15492530","15493890"," It was insane, man."
"15494190","15496970"," You don't see it as much anymore from Apple, but back in the day, dude. "
"15497530","15500550"," That whole one more thing, you'd be like fuck this."
"15500550","15503370"," I'm not even trading our Apple right now."
"15508910","15510350"," And one more thing. "
"15511170","15511570"," Shit."
"15513910","15515730"," Let's see if he can catch this one more time here."
"15516470","15518730"," You know, I'm going to turn that Apple ship back on again. "
"15519370","15522110"," I turned it off because I wanted to make that trade, but hold on here."
"15522590","15525470"," I'm going to turn that Apple ship just in case he does that stuff."
"15526590","15528050"," Tim Apple, one in one more thing. "
"15529350","15529970"," Goddamn it."
"15537040","15539580"," There's Tim Apple here talking."
"15540820","15543000"," Here we go. "
"15545470","15548670"," Score with Major League Soccer or a timer."
"15549570","15554950"," And we're happy to report that now you can even keep track of multiple timer."
"15555070","15556130"," We'll keep it low in the background. "
"15556510","15558670"," I just don't want there to be like in one more thing."
"15558670","15565770"," The new box screen experience with interactive widgets on the home screen is a big step forward for"
"15565770","15568450"," how you can personalize and use iPad."
"15569530","15571310"," So you got Apple sitting on a cliff. "
"15571790","15572710"," This is the first."
"15572950","15573990"," We're going to go over a couple of things here."
"15574450","15575270"," It's pretty big. "
"15576570","15577050"," Health."
"15577490","15581590"," The health app has been designed to take advantage of the larger screen on iPad."
"15582310","15585090"," Yeah, we get a bear cross on the one minute on Apple. "
"15585410","15585870"," It's very rare."
"15586030","15586870"," It doesn't happen that often."
"15586870","15594050"," They normally trade to their hourly trigger, which is down at 181.89. Apple bleeding off pretty"
"15594050","15595110"," hard and heavy right now. "
"15595490","15604390"," A price target on the downside on Apple 181.90. 181.90. Spy should follow suit to the downside."
"15605310","15610590"," Interactive charts make your health data come to life, letting you dive deeply into the details."
"15610590","15617850"," And for developers, health kit comes to iPad, opening up new ways to build innovative health and"
"15617850","15618870"," fitness experiences. "
"15619790","15624590"," Like RISE, who's built these compelling visualizations as part of their new iPad app."
"15625390","15630450"," Next, let's take a look at improvements we make up to the way you work with an important type of"
"15630450","15630650"," doc."
"15630870","15639770"," Spy target to the downside, 426.71. iPad is the best device for PDFs. "
"15639810","15643670"," There's your target to the downside on spy right here."
"15645070","15647030"," Boom right there, baby."
"15649290","15651290"," Even easier to work with. "
"15651890","15656390"," Thanks to new machine learning models, iPadOS can identify the fields and PDFs."
"15656610","15662470"," So you can use autofill to quickly fill them out with information like names, addresses and emails."
"15662470","15665010"," One minute bear cross on Apple. "
"15665210","15666890"," It could still squeeze here, right?"
"15667210","15670810"," But you're looking for the trade to the downside on Apple from 184."
"15672430","15682250"," 184.03 down to 181.87. So mark those two places on your own chart at home, 184.01."
"15683150","15684030"," And then 194."
"15686590","15687770"," For Apple. "
"15689030","15694650"," If you're short Apple it should be a pullback or a rip higher again just to confirm the leg lower."
"15695830","15697990"," PDFs sit right inside your notes."
"15699490","15705210"," You have all the note taking capabilities of the app and the PDF is expanded to a full width view. "
"15706150","15711510"," You can quickly review the document, flip through pages and annotate using Apple Pencil."
"15712290","15717850"," You can keep multiple PDFs in the same note, which is great for keeping related files together as"
"15717850","15718250"," you work."
"15722390","15724850"," Market crash due to Apple stickers. "
"15726450","15727370"," Love it."
"15727670","15732730"," So as you scribble something down, the changes you make appear right away on your collaborators"
"15732730","15733290"," iPad."
"15734950","15737530"," Come on, get it on down there for daddy. "
"15737530","15738550"," Come on down, baby."
"15739610","15742110"," Give me that 4-2-6-7-1."
"15743670","15744910"," Make me some money. "
"15746710","15749290"," That's two fucking great trades for today by the way."
"15750330","15752750"," 4-27's getting some premium in on them."
"15753130","15755430"," It's trading 17 cents. "
"15756350","15758270"," 4-28's were 18 cents."
"15758490","15759870"," Those are now 45 cents."
"15762510","15765590"," So that's a look at iPadOS 17. "
"15765590","15768310"," But of course, there's even more."
"15768810","15773790"," Like improvements to stage manager where we're adding even more flexibility to the position and"
"15773790","15777550"," size of your windows, giving you more control over your workspace."
"15778410","15784150"," And you can now take advantage of the built-in camera on your external display for FaceTime and"
"15784150","15784890"," conference calls. "
"15785790","15791550"," And Freeform, which gets new drawing tools like watercolor, fountain pen, and shape recognition."
"15791550","15795290"," All along with the features interested in relation to AI."
"15795290","15799330"," Follow a collaborator and track as they move around the canvas. "
"15800410","15806690"," These joint other great features like the redesigned lock screen and interactive widgets, along"
"15806690","15813230"," with the health app and great new ways to work with PDFs, as well as other features you heard about"
"15813230","15819750"," in iOS, like leaving a video message in FaceTime, inline typing predictions, and updates to"
"15819750","15820030"," messages."
"15820650","15823590"," Yeah, they're already doing their inline predictive text."
"15823710","15824710"," I'm not a fan of it. "
"15824810","15826650"," They get it fucking wrong."
"15826950","15836910"," I know you guys like Apple TV out there, but I feel like every Apple TV show is like this"
"15836910","15837490"," presentation."
"15838710","15841910"," Even Apple, man, it's like, I can't do it, dude. "
"15842050","15842570"," I can't."
"15843110","15847510"," My eyes are bleeding watching this and watching Apple TV is just like watching this."
"15847510","15848850"," It's like it's like seamless. "
"15850290","15856390"," Now, when it came to naming this release, we turned once again to Apple's legendary crack product"
"15856390","15857230"," marketing team."
"15857790","15860290"," The instructions were simple and explicit."
"15860850","15862170"," Travel far and wide. "
"15862530","15863650"," Leave no stone unturned."
"15864710","15871010"," Well, as far as we can reconstruct, that search consisted of piling in their microbus, punching in"
"15871010","15876850"," the words awesome vineyard into maps, and be lining straight to one of the most famous wine regions"
"15876850","15877670"," in the world."
"15878430","15883650"," A place celebrated by the team, perhaps a bit too much, and beloved by millions. "
"15885070","15892690"," Introducing macOS Sonoma, a big new release that will make your Mac more delightful and even more"
"15892690","15893110"," productive."
"15893950","15896710"," First, many of the features we talked about earlier."
"15896710","15897430"," Yeah, you're iPhone. "
"15897850","15898890"," I mean, I get an iPhone."
"15899390","15901530"," My rest of my family is all on iPhone."
"15901990","15905810"," I just, I'd actually only put an iPhone on because they break phones all the time. "
"15906430","15910330"," So I had, like, had one lying around and I'm like, yeah, I'll just fucking turn this thing on."
"15910690","15917090"," It's so beautiful, slow-motion videos of places around the world, like the sweeping skyline of Hong"
"15917090","15924010"," Kong, the sandstone buttes of Monument Valley, and the rolling hills of Sonoma."
"15924010","15927050"," And when you log in, Monument Valley is awesome, by the way. "
"15927310","15927790"," Great place."
"15928310","15929110"," Into your desktop."
"15930290","15934950"," Next, let's talk about making your Mac more personal through widgets. "
"15936030","15940710"," Not only are they becoming more powerful, they're also now available somewhere new."
"15941370","15942250"," Let's take a look."
"15943350","15945730"," Doesn't his voice sound a little gimmicky, too?"
"15945950","15946970"," You're just listening to his voice. "
"15947370","15949110"," Now let's look at..."
"15949690","15950950"," Sorry I shouldn't say that shit."
"15950950","15952690"," Now you're using your Mac."
"15953150","15954110"," Now you can. "
"15954510","15958030"," By simply bringing your widgets right into view here on the desktop."
"15959070","15960190"," I'd love to catch it."
"15960270","15961790"," Do you want a serious answer to that question?"
"15961970","15962990"," I was just asked..."
"15962990","15964190"," Cap, serious question. "
"15964470","15965770"," How do you keep your kids off the screens?"
"15966770","15967270"," Do you limit it?"
"15967430","15969910"," What age did you allow them to have phones, et cetera?"
"15970070","15971910"," This presentation is somewhat black marish, LOL."
"15972270","15972690"," Yeah, I agree."
"15973830","15977110"," For me, it's been a huge challenge. "
"15978090","15980550"," I'll be honest with you guys out there."
"15980550","15985170"," My widgets instantly fade into the background so I can focus."
"15985550","15991490"," So we have servers at my house or NAS servers. "
"15991530","15993490"," We have our own, like, Netflix."
"15994210","15996710"," So we created our own what they can and can't watch."
"15997650","16003150"," We also have a router that allows them to do specific things and not do other things. "
"16003970","16004890"," But I'm going to give you the truth."
"16005710","16007870"," I'm going to tell you the truth out there, okay?"
"16008410","16009730"," Some of you can't."
"16010410","16012710"," Do this because I realize life is difficult. "
"16013910","16014830"," And through them."
"16014930","16017710"," The more time you want to mute this right now is the great question."
"16018690","16020590"," I'm going to mute this right now. "
"16021330","16022810"," I'm going to give you guys an honest..."
"16022810","16024150"," I got to tell you guys something honest."
"16024910","16025810"," I love technology."
"16027370","16028890"," So we use Apple in our house. "
"16029250","16034310"," I don't because it would cost me an arm and a leg to do what I want to do."
"16035390","16037750"," Or need to do in Apple's garden walls."
"16037750","16039750"," Keep me from doing it often times. "
"16040110","16040970"," Android and iPhones."
"16042910","16044870"," For me personally are limiting."
"16045670","16047410"," Now my wife and kids love that shit. "
"16047570","16047950"," They all have."
"16048450","16050070"," It's like I wear an old..."
"16050070","16050950"," I'm not wearing it right now."
"16051050","16052410"," But you guys will sometimes see me wearing it. "
"16052850","16055770"," I wear an old Captain Willard watch."
"16058230","16059690"," You know, I have to wind it up."
"16059930","16061550"," My body will have to shake my arm. "
"16061890","16063490"," I have to be wearing it for it to keep time."
"16065610","16069150"," My wife and kids wear Apple iPhone watches."
"16071230","16072950"," But I'm going to tell you the secret. "
"16073850","16077290"," Just spend time with your children."
"16077870","16081030"," Cannot emphasize that enough."
"16083110","16084470"," Spend time. "
"16084990","16087230"," These are like the things that..."
"16088470","16089890"," The kids are great today."
"16090010","16090530"," They're learning a ton."
"16090730","16091550"," They're very smart, right?"
"16091550","16094070"," But there's some things that they're losing like. "
"16095990","16097310"," My kids are great readers."
"16098970","16101390"," But that's because we read books with them."
"16104450","16105950"," They journal with us. "
"16106450","16107830"," They paint with us."
"16108170","16110790"," We take them to the museum, believe it or not."
"16110890","16112010"," We go to the art museum all the time. "
"16113010","16114890"," We take them to..."
"16114890","16116650"," You guys might not like Burning Man."
"16117170","16118510"," But we do Burning Man stuff."
"16118870","16119990"," We don't do the big burn with the kids. "
"16119990","16125590"," But they have Burning Man type of events around here because they're exposed to music, art."
"16127110","16128830"," All these other things, right?"
"16129530","16135790"," Matter of fact, this weekend, my kids are not in Girl Scouts."
"16136530","16137390"," But I was a Boy Scout. "
"16137870","16138430"," I was an Eagle Scout."
"16140050","16144770"," But I do those Boy Scout lessons with my kids."
"16145670","16152430"," So as a prime example, this weekend, I took my children sailing, right?"
"16152930","16154970"," I moved to Detroit, Michigan. "
"16155690","16156790"," And I'm a sailor."
"16157730","16159970"," And I didn't want to own a big boat here in Detroit."
"16161590","16163610"," So I bought a trailer boat. "
"16164370","16165870"," 20 feet long, goes on a trailer."
"16167230","16168710"," The guy was basically giving it away."
"16168830","16172050"," I think it cost me $1,000 or $500 or something. "
"16172330","16173770"," I don't know what it cost, but it was something like that."
"16174150","16175410"," I went and picked it up for me."
"16175410","16177610"," I took it back to the house. "
"16178090","16178930"," I fixed it up."
"16179310","16180250"," First year I got it."
"16180250","16180810"," I fixed it up. "
"16181090","16182410"," Then each year we do more work on it."
"16182510","16184290"," But this thing has a little cutting cabin in it."
"16186550","16188050"," And we put it in the water. "
"16189050","16193690"," Then we sail and camp with it."
"16194210","16196070"," So I'll take it to a public launch."
"16196430","16197990"," I used to have it in a well and all that kind of shit. "
"16198110","16201430"," But right now I'm just taking it to a public launch."
"16203050","16204710"," And we put the boat in the water."
"16206090","16208070"," And this weekend specifically, we went camping. "
"16210870","16212510"," So you go camping with your..."
"16213050","16214010"," I go camping with..."
"16214010","16216170"," So what I did this week with my kids is we went camping."
"16216930","16220630"," And we wrote a list for the entire summer of things we're doing with our children."
"16222270","16223750"," And things we want to accomplish. "
"16224310","16225670"," And we've got star charts."
"16227530","16229430"," So they can learn celestial navigation."
"16229930","16233290"," We do this every year, but every year gets more complicated and more complicated. "
"16235330","16242750"," This year I think it's Jupiter, Uranus, and Jupiter, Uranus, and Saturn, I believe, are all in"
"16242750","16243310"," alignment right now."
"16243410","16246470"," So we try to pick those planetary alignments out at nighttime."
"16248070","16252670"," We did like advanced fire making this week. "
"16253210","16254210"," So like, how do you make a fire?"
"16255650","16259590"," And we're doing an advanced course that we did this weekend."
"16259630","16260970"," I was just talking to Joe Donut about this."
"16261310","16266590"," So it was kind of fascinating because my youngest got a new knife. "
"16267370","16273050"," And this knife, I didn't know, but my older daughter knew that it had a flint hidden in it."
"16273650","16276110"," Now this knife is not known for its flint."
"16276770","16279310"," You can buy flint like a steel. "
"16280390","16281790"," That's really nice, right?"
"16282050","16283010"," It's easy to start a fire."
"16283010","16284490"," This is like one of those crappy ones."
"16285250","16287450"," That's like an afterthought to make a kid happy. "
"16288670","16290370"," But a kid does not use that."
"16290590","16293870"," So I didn't think I'd be able to start a fire with it."
"16294330","16296490"," I was able to start a fire with this flint and steel. "
"16298810","16301430"," And with my children there doing it with them."
"16301870","16306270"," So they don't get that stuff that one on one, right?"
"16306650","16309950"," Even if they're in the Cub Scouts, they might get it in the Cub Scouts, but not that one on"
"16309950","16310170"," one."
"16310170","16315430"," So whether you're a mom or dad or whatever, an uncle or a friend of a family or whatever, like"
"16315430","16317390"," that one on one, hands on. "
"16318390","16320330"," You do it, I'll do it, we'll do it together."
"16321350","16321650"," It's critical."
"16322990","16326790"," Journal writing, when you're teaching a child how to write an essay, we're working on that right"
"16326790","16327190"," now too. "
"16328110","16332510"," How to form a complete thought, how to think about something."
"16333150","16337290"," Another one we're doing right now is the scientific method in essay writing."
"16338550","16344370"," Using the scientific method to posit a thought and then trying to back up your arguments inside of"
"16344370","16344630"," a journal. "
"16345990","16349550"," So we have all these things planned for the summer that we do every year."
"16349810","16352430"," We do in the winter, in the fall, summer, whatever, spring."
"16353490","16354950"," Then we advance them as they go along. "
"16355250","16360530"," These real life lessons that kids with tech today don't always get right now."
"16361530","16362370"," So we did that this weekend."
"16362710","16363510"," That was like one of our things. "
"16363850","16366750"," Another cool thing that we did was I had a tent."
"16367310","16369190"," An islet was broken out of the tent."
"16369990","16371750"," And my kids were setting them up. "
"16371870","16372850"," We set these things up."
"16373510","16375970"," And as we're setting them up, we're on this island, right?"
"16376130","16377190"," That's an old coal island."
"16377990","16383570"," Now, these use it as a shipping island to load coal onto ships. "
"16384150","16385070"," It's abandoned now."
"16385169","16386270"," It has a bed in town on it."
"16386890","16387810"," It's out of the middle of the water. "
"16389130","16390270"," It has trees and stuff."
"16390450","16391210"," And we're setting up a camp."
"16393910","16396810"," We're in the advanced stage specifically with the nine year old. "
"16397790","16401090"," And I'm like, you know, we want to be, we're on a slope."
"16401310","16405509"," And I'm like, you know, you don't want to be down there where a river could run through it if"
"16405509","16407169"," it rains and you get washed away, right?"
"16407930","16411430"," And then we're looking above into the trees to see if there are any dead limbs that could come down"
"16411430","16413590"," or even dead trees, a widow maker to kill us."
"16414810","16417130"," And then we're camping on a slope. "
"16417130","16420150"," Do you want your head on the bottom of the slope or above the slope?"
"16420710","16423029"," And then the tent itself had an eyelet broken."
"16423950","16425290"," We have these little tiny tents."
"16427310","16431349"," And we couldn't get one of the holes to hold. "
"16432610","16435110"," And we needed a solution without having an eyelet available."
"16435710","16437470"," And so we figured out a solution together."
"16437830","16441869"," So those like real world applications with a child these days is being lost. "
"16442090","16442770"," You can see it in kids."
"16443390","16447070"," They're not, I was talking to my daughter this week and I said that they're not dexterous."
"16447150","16450770"," Kids are not, they don't have dexterity like they once did. "
"16451210","16452550"," Even kids that play sports today."
"16453070","16456689"," When I was like the last generation, my generation was the generation of Nintendo."
"16458050","16460570"," So my friends, all teenagers, right?"
"16460810","16464050"," My younger siblings made Commodore 64 and apples. "
"16465009","16469610"," But like the video game generation started just with my younger generation."
"16469610","16472910"," And kids, even if they played sports, they got sucked in, right?"
"16473070","16474910"," Super Mario Brothers and beyond, that was it."
"16475610","16478250"," Every kid had, we had Atari's and clicko vision and television. "
"16478990","16480430"," And we're talking about like the video game generation."
"16481810","16486770"," And since then, even if a kid plays sports today, they're a little more goofy and awkward than"
"16486770","16487270"," they've ever been."
"16487869","16494790"," And that's because kids never spent any time at all on the phone, on computer computing devices. "
"16494790","16495570"," Not that's bad."
"16496009","16502250"," Just, you can see a different stark difference in a kid that's climbed trees his entire life."
"16502689","16503849"," Or her trees her whole life. "
"16505050","16507529"," Or has just run around with a stick in the backyard."
"16507990","16508550"," What do I do with a stick?"
"16509430","16510849"," You know, it's like, oh, that was a kid."
"16511390","16514130"," We all kinds of imaginative things we did with sticks, right?"
"16514910","16516550"," So you have to do that with your kids. "
"16517330","16520910"," You don't have to, but kids really appreciate it."
"16520910","16523070"," Sometimes my kids do get angry about it."
"16523169","16524950"," Sometimes they're like, oh, God, I got to do this again. "
"16526050","16531490"," And, but if you do that more and more of the kids, it gives them that well-rounded youth."
"16534310","16537210"," Just to get them said, these are all easy, simple things."
"16537369","16538650"," They don't cost any money either. "
"16539650","16540390"," We do photography."
"16540990","16545009"," We do, my effect, we're on wildlife photography right now."
"16545450","16548710"," And we recorded wildlife sounds this weekend. "
"16548710","16554189"," My oldest daughter and I sat at a sunset in a marsh."
"16555529","16557210"," And we didn't have anything on."
"16557930","16559890"," And her and I sat for that sunset. "
"16560509","16564390"," And I said, just be quiet and listen to nature here."
"16565490","16566650"," And so we just got quiet."
"16567650","16570450"," And we listened to the sounds of a sunset. "
"16571369","16574210"," And the different animals that were getting ready for nighttime."
"16575270","16576150"," And I asked my oldest daughter."
"16576150","16579450"," I said, when we go, I said, I want you to think about this. "
"16579610","16582369"," I said, do you think that it's as loud as it is right now at nighttime?"
"16582710","16583290"," She said, yes."
"16583849","16584290"," That's okay."
"16584970","16587110"," We'll wait until it gets dark and we'll listen again. "
"16587410","16588029"," And so I know what happened."
"16588050","16589630"," We'll come down here, walk down here and just listen."
"16590349","16591710"," And it was a completely different set of sounds. "
"16592169","16593169"," It was very quiet."
"16599480","16601360"," Yeah, you were raised in a farm and you have time to play."
"16601560","16602900"," So I own what I don't own. "
"16603080","16606540"," My family owns a 7,000 acre ranch."
"16607500","16608460"," A real farm."
"16609099","16613480"," 7,000 acres, probably larger than a lot of cities and towns you live in. "
"16614960","16616119"," So we have a real ranch."
"16616220","16621160"," I go there twice a year and I brand cattle on the spring."
"16621439","16624300"," Normally it's most of the brand cattle in the spring and then we go back to the family area. "
"16626340","16627660"," We still ride horses."
"16631160","16632599"," Yeah, like touching grass, man."
"16632880","16633660"," Like just touch grass. "
"16636320","16637980"," Yeah, chores in the morning, chores in the evening."
"16638560","16638880"," We have chores."
"16639180","16639900"," We give our kids chores. "
"16640320","16640840"," It's a big one."
"16642759","16644740"," So like that, it's being lost with kids, right?"
"16645220","16646619"," We know that that's being lost with kids."
"16646860","16649200"," Chores, farms are being lost, ranching. "
"16650220","16651040"," Our family ranch."
"16652419","16653480"," A bunch of kids."
"16654580","16656060"," None are back home right now. "
"16657259","16658080"," They're all off doing."
"16658240","16660320"," Some of them are still doing that kind of work."
"16660860","16662720"," We have one cousin who's out. "
"16662939","16669779"," We have one cousin that's out in New Mexico."
"16670759","16672919"," Wrangling wild stallions, believe it or not."
"16673580","16678060"," But even kids in the farms and ranchers aren't coming back home from my experience. "
"16679320","16682320"," Not like they once, there were generations in ranching and farming."
"16682560","16684320"," You'd have a bunch of kids, they'd all stay."
"16685939","16688759"," And that shit started ending in the 60s and 70s, right?"
"16688759","16690720"," And now it's even worse. "
"16693000","16701680"," Yeah, I might ask you, if you're living on a farm right now, are you seeing the same kids staying"
"16701680","16701919"," home?"
"16702259","16705340"," Because we're not in our family ranching community."
"16705680","16706520"," It's rare."
"16707560","16713000"," They sometimes come back and they're older, but they're leaving more frequently in their teens, not"
"16713000","16713460"," coming back. "
"16717279","16719480"," Yeah, family ranch is in Eclaca, Montana."
"16719880","16720500"," Spilling ranch."
"16722300","16724680"," If you guys are very Montana, Eclaca. "
"16727500","16730040"," They got roads named after us in that kind of thing, so."
"16734610","16735770"," Perhaps you take it easy, brother."
"16736390","16741770"," Just like they get time on TV's, like they get time on the computer, they get time on the phone. "
"16742750","16747169"," Get those phones out of fucking hands and doing something, anything."
"16747770","16749610"," And you have to be there too, that's the problem."
"16751050","16754390"," That's the issue is you have to be there with them. "
"16754610","16755529"," It's a lot of work."
"16757150","16759070"," It's not fun, it's not fun, it's not fun."
"16759090","16762070"," It's not like, you can't, no you can't. "
"16762130","16764990"," People just don't say go outside and put it with your friends in the neighborhood."
"16766070","16767250"," Those days are over."
"16767689","16769730"," You're only gonna be there for your kids now. "
"16770210","16773509"," When I was a kid, it was like go outside and do this and I'll see you in a couple"
"16773509","16773830"," hours."
"16774169","16775029"," Don't come in until it's dark."
"16776090","16779550"," You know, generally speaking, they seem like they're over these days. "
"16782250","16783570"," You got to be there, you got to be engaged."
"16793130","16794070"," What's going on, Bears?"
"16794450","16795530"," Are you holding on to it or what?"
"16797750","16798790"," What are you doing, Bears?"
"16805380","16806900"," What conference call on Mac?"
"16807340","16810460"," To your favorite playlist on iPhone, all without missing a beat."
"16811560","16814420"," And for the moment, we want to share your content with those around you. "
"16814460","16816680"," Yeah, graduate school and head for the city, right?"
"16817160","16824360"," Even like, even young farmers, man, it's like young farmers are like, give me the technology,"
"16824360","16824900"," right?"
"16826640","16832300"," I need technology, they kind of do force into it to adopt technology, just to survive as a new"
"16832300","16833020"," farmer these days."
"16833440","16838300"," Easiest way to share your audio, videos, and photos to nearby speakers and screens."
"16838940","16840580"," And we're making airplay more seamless. "
"16840600","16841420"," What's going on, Bears?"
"16841720","16842960"," Are you gonna keep this in line here?"
"16843120","16843420"," What's up?"
"16844100","16845020"," I want to know."
"16845400","16846900"," To learn your airplay preferences."
"16848060","16850500"," So if you usually listen to music while you cook dinner. "
"16850920","16853420"," Dude, bears getting rolled on the VIX right now."
"16853600","16855800"," Getting rolled hard on the VIX."
"16856640","16858960"," VIX looking for new lows to the downside. "
"16859960","16860960"," Mom bears."
"16862400","16864180"," Letting you play even more."
"16865200","16866360"," Just your voice. "
"16866780","16870040"," Just say, Siri, play Arlo Parks in SoundCloud."
"16870580","16872060"," With so much media."
"16872080","16874900"," My least favorite place in America, probably. "
"16875780","16879540"," Like one of my most favorite places in America, the Southern Tetons."
"16880000","16882940"," One of my least favorite places in America, Wyoming."
"16884580","16886160"," Easy to take advantage. "
"16886160","16887240"," Same state too."
"16887840","16889600"," Watch an episode of your favorite show."
"16890060","16891300"," Or practice tomorrow's presentation. "
"16892280","16892940"," Peering is simple."
"16894040","16896420"," Just scan the QR code and tap the confirmation."
"16897320","16898340"," Yeah, we're in Montana. "
"16898560","16900880"," We're kind of in a sweet spot in Montana too."
"16901000","16901800"," It's in the Black Hills."
"16902580","16903900"," It's in the four corners. "
"16904540","16907740"," Airplay will be available in select hotels before the end of the year."
"16908100","16908820"," With more to follow."
"16909400","16912080"," And to make your next trip even more enjoyable. "
"16912640","16913720"," We have some exciting up there."
"16913720","16915880"," Oh, we got the bounce on Apple."
"16916660","16919820"," So Apple just did bounce off of that 181 and changed. "
"16920060","16922000"," Passing a cable or sending a link."
"16922560","16923780"," Take a look at Apple real quick."
"16924040","16925500"," See if the bears can hold on here. "
"16925800","16926740"," And what's playing?"
"16927220","16928680"," Even passengers in the vast seat."
"16929220","16932300"," That's why we're thrilled to bring share play to the car."
"16932760","16937460"," Now when the driver's iPhone is connected to car play, any passenger's iPhone will automatically. "
"16937580","16940540"," Beautiful move here for Apple, believe it or not."
"16940540","16942320"," Let's take a quick look here."
"16942780","16946180"," So Apple with a nice, nice, solid news train. "
"16947240","16948240"," All the way down."
"16948820","16949340"," Bam."
"16949880","16950460"," Come back up. "
"16950900","16952020"," All the way down."
"16952800","16953000"," Bam."
"16953380","16956300"," Do they get that last little boom down there or not?"
"16957340","16958960"," Trend is still up for Apple. "
"16960040","16961900"," You know what the bears want."
"16962180","16964680"," I'll tell you what the bears want, which they haven't gotten."
"16964680","16968240"," Like access, AirPod settings, home cameras. "
"16968520","16969600"," To break trend."
"16970500","16971560"," These are profiles."
"16972760","16973900"," All with a touch. "
"16974020","16976760"," There's looking to break trend on Apple."
"16977020","16978160"," Has not happened here."
"16978520","16979780"," I mean, look at that move. "
"16980560","16983760"," Look at that move on Apple."
"16984580","16986940"," Not able to break trend."
"16987360","16988400"," Favorite family photos. "
"16988660","16989160"," Seriously."
"16990260","16992360"," Now to enjoy these special moments even more."
"16992360","16994600"," You can select memories as you. "
"16995000","16996100"," Like all Apple."
"16996320","16997060"," All bears want."
"16997300","16998080"," All bear wants. "
"16998280","16999200"," All bear needs."
"16999420","17000940"," They want to break that hourly trend."
"17001360","17004020"," They want to reject hourly trend and come on down. "
"17005500","17007300"," So what is Apple looking for here?"
"17007460","17007740"," Let's see."
"17010760","17012900"," Apple is looking for that break below."
"17013960","17014440"," 181. "
"17016000","17017060"," See the break below."
"17018560","17019920"," Pull back to hourly."
"17020660","17024100"," Come on back under and there's the confirmation for the next leg lower. "
"17024720","17025280"," Right."
"17028320","17029680"," Something like that, right?"
"17030800","17032360"," Hasn't happened yet over here."
"17032740","17033760"," Big old question mark. "
"17035740","17037840"," Dude, they haven't even broken trend."
"17038620","17042600"," At 174 Apple hasn't broken trend, believe it or not."
"17042920","17043420"," That wild. "
"17044600","17048040"," That sideways and roll over trade that I talked about on spy."
"17048040","17048420"," Right."
"17049120","17051660"," So if you're like looking for that spy roll over trade. "
"17052060","17052680"," It's right there."
"17052780","17053820"," It's showing itself, right?"
"17055280","17056680"," Get that roll over."
"17057840","17059180"," Come over there, right?"
"17061520","17063720"," Get that blast down over there. "
"17063760","17065160"," You get to daily over there."
"17065300","17066800"," 175 or so."
"17067220","17067780"," That's all they want. "
"17067940","17068620"," It's all bear wants."
"17075980","17076680"," Right there."
"17076800","17077540"," You can see it. "
"17079140","17080480"," Bam, bam, bam."
"17081160","17084040"," Last time that happened was May 19th."
"17084340","17085340"," Talked about April. "
"17088560","17091660"," There's the April 17th example."
"17092660","17093720"," There's another example."
"17094060","17094520"," Squeeze higher. "
"17094920","17095960"," Slam back down to the daily."
"17097120","17099120"," So even though we're following trend higher."
"17100160","17102400"," These bears are like, oh, yeah, get me down there. "
"17103040","17104500"," Coming down there in June, baby."
"17106300","17107360"," Here's your start."
"17107540","17109180"," We'll see if it works or not. "
"17112760","17114540"," See if the bears can get underneath."
"17115620","17117940"," Key moment here for bears, apple bears."
"17118240","17123580"," We want to trade under 181.89 and hold. "
"17124620","17126300"," Hold under that number."
"17128620","17131260"," This was the load that was just created."
"17131500","17132600"," This was the roll over. "
"17133840","17135560"," On apple you want to get underneath."
"17136580","17137820"," 181.87 on apple."
"17138280","17162120"," Oh, they're"
"17162120","17163440"," not let me buy puts right now. "
"17163880","17164840"," Tell me to go fuck myself."
"17167600","17168460"," We're going down."
"17169860","17171020"," They won't let me buy some puts. "
"17171260","17171780"," They're like, nope."
"17176450","17177330"," Come on, dude."
"17177970","17178690"," Give me some puts. "
"17179990","17182530"," Oh, dude, I hate these fucking dealers right now."
"17182530","17183050"," They're sucking balls."
"17186630","17186990"," Sorry. "
"17188450","17190130"," These dealers are trying to get me to chase."
"17190410","17191450"," And I'm like, I ain't doing it, dude."
"17193070","17194710"," It's trying to buy some puts right there. "
"17194850","17196090"," They wouldn't, they wouldn't let me in the door."
"17198470","17200310"," It's trying to grab 427s."
"17201290","17202830"," I'm over here blabbing to you guys. "
"17207090","17208850"," I was trying to buy this one right here."
"17210550","17212410"," They told me they told me to get fucked."
"17214350","17215650"," Some flat right now. "
"17215950","17218050"," I wanted 427Ps."
"17223080","17225560"," I tell you what, man, these dealers, dude."
"17226500","17230120"," These dealers know what's up past four weeks, three weeks. "
"17231360","17234400"," These fucking dealers, they're running some kind of program in the background."
"17235340","17236680"," Trying to fuck with retailers right now."
"17236800","17238500"," If it's not the dealers, it's the order sellers. "
"17239840","17242260"," I've had a real hard time in the past four weeks."
"17244540","17246640"," Plus four weeks, up or down, doesn't matter."
"17246800","17251680"," If I know the direction, I always fucking know the direction, mostly. "
"17252420","17259760"," Only the last four weeks have they been fucking with my, they're not filling me like they used to."
"17261200","17265980"," I don't know if that's retailers or if that's them trying to, I think it's the order sellers."
"17266660","17268280"," I still haven't talked tasty about it. "
"17270780","17272740"," Tasty is one of the main offenders right now."
"17274560","17275880"," I have to make a video on that."
"17276540","17278020"," Maybe I'll contact Tasty first. "
"17279880","17282960"," I'm telling them I'm going to make a video about it because I'm kind of fucking pissy."
"17283140","17285820"," This is the same shit they were doing back with GME."
"17286020","17287360"," They're doing it on the greater market right now. "
"17297940","17299320"," There's getting ready here, right?"
"17299740","17300620"," They're all saucy."
"17301820","17306560"," If we get below 181.89 on Apple, it could take time for the next leg lower."
"17312830","17315570"," I got to make, I got to take a phone call here, which sucks because we're selling. "
"17321640","17322320"," Yeah, no, no."
"17322500","17324040"," So, I don't know if you guys know this."
"17325180","17329620"," What, like, you know, you have the, so, let me start at the beginning. "
"17329620","17339060"," So, when the microscope is on, when the microscope is on, zero date buyers and sellers, like, zero"
"17339060","17339540"," date, right?"
"17342220","17345660"," And you are an order flow company, right?"
"17345820","17347300"," You're in between the dealer and me, the retailer."
"17349740","17350860"," You're going to try."
"17351200","17356900"," There's a guy in an office somewhere that's like, hey, look, all these dumbass retailers want to do"
"17356900","17357460"," zero dates. "
"17358480","17363660"," So, what they're doing right now specifically is likely to have a program and they're increasing."
"17365120","17368520"," Let's say it was a one to two penny edge."
"17369880","17370840"," They'll go, fuck it. "
"17370920","17372880"," We'll do three to four pennies or, you know what I mean?"
"17373040","17373840"," Like three to four pennies."
"17374720","17377820"," And they might not catch me, but they're going to catch you or some new trader."
"17381660","17384560"," For a couple pennies, two, three, four pennies sometimes. "
"17385400","17388600"," Like a penny, I don't mind paying a penny, but two, three pennies."
"17388780","17395940"," So, right now there's like, in the background, there's some scraping going on."
"17397980","17406510"," I notice a trust, dude, I make like, in a day I can make, on average,"
"17407450","17409330"," scalping. "
"17413170","17416030"," Ten to 30 trades if I'm scaling in a day."
"17416150","17417670"," So, I do this all day, every day."
"17417950","17419190"," All day, every day, all day, every day. "
"17419370","17420110"," I know it every day."
"17420770","17426310"," How it feels if they're filling or not filling, filling, not filling what they're filling at."
"17427230","17428050"," I notice it. "
"17430510","17434490"," So, there's, right now there's a last, but last four weeks or so."
"17434710","17436770"," It's likely the order flow company is doing this."
"17438150","17438750"," Not catching fills. "
"17450380","17452740"," What do you see that makes you want to buy on Friday?"
"17452980","17454420"," On Friday, I showed it to you."
"17454680","17459600"," I did a whole video on Friday where I showed you the setups for long and short."
"17459980","17461340"," It was fairly, fairly simple. "
"17461460","17464380"," An edge day trading, that is the system right there."
"17465840","17468940"," I think Binky made a cut of, cut that video part of the video out."
"17469620","17474140"," And it shows you what you're looking for to, to get zero dates, calls or puts. "
"17474140","17475640"," It's fairly easy to see."
"17476380","17477120"," It's a money maker."
"17478680","17479760"," Consistent money maker. "
"17486960","17489160"," No, we should tag four twenty, four twenty six."
"17490000","17491280"," We should tag this down here."
"17492420","17493760"," And Apple should cross underneath. "
"17494060","17496880"," It's a one eighty one ninety and hold."
"17500040","17500880"," Fairly good here."
"17502780","17504600"," Fairly high probability trades. "
"17509620","17511480"," But the fills is what's problem."
"17511920","17513100"," That's where I get the fucking problem."
"17513680","17519280"," Because you're trying to be, what you're trying to do is you're trying to be with the dealer. "
"17520520","17521000"," Right."
"17521760","17522840"," You want to be with the dealer."
"17523940","17526080"," And you don't want to be after the dealer. "
"17526480","17528840"," And you definitely never want to be after the."
"17531160","17533060"," After the order flow seller."
"17535560","17537420"," You're like, you're adding too many. "
"17537860","17538480"," I caught the raw."
"17538620","17539240"," I timed it wrong."
"17539580","17541560"," You're already trying to beat everything else. "
"17541780","17546300"," And then once you get, like adding those two other edges against you in the trade."
"17546980","17549460"," Oftentimes leads to a low probability win."
"17549780","17551960"," So if it leaves me behind, it does. "
"17555870","17557810"," It's like every little, you need every little edge."
"17558650","17560430"," This whole market is built for you to lose your money."
"17560610","17563090"," So I need every single little edge to be. "
"17564970","17565970"," A winner for me."
"17586820","17591740"," Yeah, it's kind of like, uh, like I'm trying to catch like, uh, let's say, let's say I'm trying to"
"17591740","17592620"," catch 10 cents."
"17593900","17596880"," Like I want to be in it 10 out of 2021. "
"17597380","17598860"," They're trying to fill it 14."
"17600260","17600640"," Right."
"17602140","17605600"," Uh, we get to maybe let's say we get to 20 or 21. "
"17605600","17607280"," And I'm at 14."
"17607520","17612660"," And as they as we roll into 2021, 20 or 21 cents."
"17613420","17615460"," And let's say it snaps back up on me. "
"17616180","17616440"," Right."
"17616540","17618300"," I've only got those two, three pennies."
"17619120","17621180"," Uh, whereas if I'm in a 10, I can get out of 21. "
"17621240","17625520"," Even if it goes 24 cents, I'm not going to get caught in the 24 to 20."
"17625660","17627080"," So it's like this."
"17628080","17628600"," I don't know. "
"17628680","17629900"," It's like a, it's like a bunch of different."
"17630600","17634060"," Did you figure out it's going down to figure out it's going up to catch the price that you wanted."
"17636520","17639500"," You know, you're getting caught in the downside move on the way back up. "
"17639600","17640700"," Did you get your hundred percent?"
"17641140","17645820"," Did you only get 30% of your paying taxes on the 30% paying the fees on the trade?"
"17646280","17653340"," Like all these, like just like long list of long, long, long, long list of, um, things you need to"
"17653340","17654140"," go right for yourself."
"17662710","17664610"," Oh, no, see, I used to do this, man."
"17665010","17670590"," I used to trade like, uh, I used to trade like fucking $30,000 on zero dates every trade. "
"17671430","17674270"," Yeah, somewhere in there."
"17674750","17680050"," And after a while, they knew who I was, the fucking, uh, the fucking, the door to float guys do."
"17680150","17680750"," They know who you are. "
"17680870","17683770"," They'll start slamming you into block trading and then you get fucked."
"17684270","17685390"," People are like, that's not true."
"17685510","17686270"," I'm like, that's bullshit. "
"17687470","17688970"," So now I have to hide my trading."
"17688970","17691250"," I have to like, try to break it all up."
"17691450","17693110"," There's all kinds of nonsense I have to do. "
"17695130","17697390"," But like, they kind of identify who you are."
"17697990","17702450"," That's even with any kind of trade, like big trade and I got to call a broker and shit and"
"17702450","17707550"," negotiate a price like, uh, I don't want to talk about it right now."
"17707610","17708950"," I've talked about it in the stream before. "
"17711970","17714590"," You will get fucked or it's all order flow usually."
"17715070","17716530"," See, it's the middle man company."
"17717270","17717870"," It's not the dealers. "
"17718290","17722010"," It's the, it's these fucking companies they sell order flow to."
"17724890","17726870"," I'm sure they build a profile on you."
"17727050","17728350"," I'm fucking 100% positive. "
"17730190","17731330"," 100% percent."
"17731970","17732850"," You trade this much."
"17733050","17733730"," This is your size. "
"17734130","17734870"," Then you go into this group."
"17735370","17736230"," People are like, that'll do that."
"17736390","17737110"," I'm like, I would. "
"17738470","17739270"," I would."
"17739390","17743850"," If you're trading size and they could, they could squeeze off, you know, percentage off you more."
"17744590","17745630"," You're not paying attention. "
"17746630","17747750"," That's a fucking lutely."
"17752900","17754300"," Yeah, no, no, no."
"17754520","17757440"," We're talking six figure sizes and stuff, dude. "
"17757580","17758080"," We're not talking."
"17758420","17758680"," We're not talking."
"17759360","17760200"," We're not talking. "
"17760300","17761140"," I've already shown that history."
"17761520","17766880"," You guys have actually shown the actual tax documents, so I don't need to show that shit ever"
"17766880","17767060"," again."
"17767580","17769680"," I made my bones showing you guys that shit. "
"17769800","17775800"," Chairman as well says again, he will pursue contempt of Congress charges against the FBI."
"17776280","17777960"," They can do that anymore at them either."
"17777960","17780180"," I mean, fucking trade and size on that shit anymore. "
"17781900","17787260"," Just trade fucking one, two, three, four, five thousand dollars and just disappear."
"17791720","17793480"," This dream is sponsored by us."
"17793480","17800040"," So many guys have seen me actually post that stuff on Twitter signing up to the tick. "
"17800420","17801960"," You can't fake that shit."
"17802120","17803280"," That's all I think that was all like."
"17805020","17808700"," Scans of my papers that I go to send to my attorneys and stuff, so. "
"17812410","17814310"," But I can't trade that anymore, man."
"17814670","17815390"," Like trade that shit."
"17815610","17816870"," That's one of the reasons. "
"17817130","17819890"," So my attorney's advised me not to do the."
"17824010","17826610"," The spread challenge with you guys."
"17828230","17830750"," Publicly because two reasons. "
"17831110","17833110"," One, it's like giving financial advice."
"17833110","17836670"," And the second reason was too many of you doing that shit."
"17837550","17838650"," It's like, what do you got?"
"17838830","17840730"," Like millions of fucking dollars. "
"17841190","17842290"," They'll see that shit."
"17843210","17847090"," You see like twenty five million dollars from the market for a call spread."
"17848130","17849050"," Two fucking strikes. "
"17849830","17852150"," It's not going to move it, but it's going to they're going to see it."
"17852670","17854170"," They're going to fucking see it guaranteed."
"17855170","17857790"," We're all like slamming the same strikes same fucking times. "
"17863310","17870180"," Yeah, I'll get on the proof."
"17871420","17871980"," Don't worry."
"17872200","17873720"," I already trade with people outside of this. "
"17873840","17875760"," You know, there's people in this stream that I trade with."
"17876500","17876900"," Like."
"17878240","17879380"," There's people in this stream. "
"17879600","17882700"," We trade big amounts of large amounts of money serious amounts of money."
"17883680","17884080"," So."
"17885480","17886460"," Outside of the stream. "
"17886540","17887340"," I trade with these guys."
"17889760","17891280"," I don't want to go to fucking jail, man."
"17891280","17892280"," I'm not no fin round. "
"17892440","17892760"," No SEC."
"17894340","17895040"," No SEC."
