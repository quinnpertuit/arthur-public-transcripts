"157590","159570"," So we got a bunch to talk about, don't we?"
"162270","166390"," First, I can't see all of the stream chat at the moment. "
"166390","171450"," I don't know why, but I'm gonna go through right now and try to find everybody and say good morning"

"208170","211790"," ton of money made today, but we get a bunch of stuff to go over."
"211930","213010"," We have a ton of crap."
"213010","218470"," So remember when we were rolling when we were at the bottom and everybody was calling for a stock"
"218470","219110"," market crash. "
"219170","223530"," Now we're kind of the top looking for a role."
"223890","227730"," How much of a role is that going to be seeing some good news on shelter inflation?"
"228250","229310"," Turn this shit off here."
"229390","229710"," Hold on. "
"232190","237770"," So we got a ton of stuff we got like miles and books to go over here."
"238030","244950"," So so I want you to know so any of you bears out there."
"245330","247290"," We're going to start with this. "
"248850","250010"," Hold on here."
"250910","252470"," So I'm gonna give you guys a quick heads up."
"252630","254050"," Let me put firstly post this on. "
"254610","256070"," Let me post this on."
"257430","258930"," We post this on fin to it."
"259010","259329"," Hold on. "
"260070","263330"," So I want to get any trouble here for being like, Oh, you didn't do this."
"263410","264250"," You didn't do that."
"265070","266090"," Because I forget shit all the time. "
"266270","266550"," Roll band."
"268770","270910"," We got a ton of stuff."
"271170","272330"," Get a paper and a pen out. "
"274510","276710"," Because I want you to write this stuff down."
"276910","279010"," Open up a notepad whatever it is you have to do."
"284060","285560"," Don't say I didn't tell you. "
"286460","290760"," Don't show up to the stream in three hours and be like, What's going on?"
"290920","293680"," Or you said this or whatever the fuck it is you guys say."
"294720","295780"," I think it's COVID."
"296560","298620"," Someone said that the other day about COVID. "
"298760","301460"," They're like, everybody's fucked up now."
"301580","304660"," And I'm actually we'll talk about COVID here in a second."
"304900","305820"," So I did get COVID. "
"305880","311220"," You guys saw me retest on a stream and I was still COVID positive too."
"311680","317620"," Some of you saw that I actually did a test here on stream and I was positive again."
"319100","320220"," It hadn't left. "
"320720","322060"," So hold on here."
"322160","322640"," What are I gonna do?"
"322780","325140"," We gotta go to fucking thin twin post this shit."
"327900","330220"," Hold on. "
"331540","333480"," Number one, I'm alive."
"335960","337620"," Any of you that care from alive?"
"337960","338500"," Yes, I'm alive."
"338920","343720"," I don't think I'm I was doing some cognitive testing last week. "
"344680","348860"," I was afraid I'd go down that whole right be damaged from my brain."
"350920","352380"," Very scared."
"352380","353860"," We'll talk about COVID. "
"353860","354600"," We'll get into COVID."
"354740","356320"," But if you're a bear, I got to talk to you about something."
"356600","358640"," Okay, you're a bear, you're a seller. "
"359800","361640"," We got a chat about something here."
"361780","362680"," Give me one quick second."
"363740","368560"," So we got a bunch to go over this morning, which papers and pens out and all that kind of"
"368560","368740"," stuff. "
"368900","378280"," So number one, there's $2.2 trillion of options, notional expiring today on SPX"
"378280","380380"," in the morning."
"381520","384720"," Spy weekly, spy, single-socks options in the afternoon."
"385200","388180"," Okay, so SPX is this morning. "
"388200","390300"," And then later on today, we got spy and all the other crap."
"391080","394820"," Almost 40% of the gamma will roll off on Monday."
"395560","396880"," So I want you to be aware of that. "
"397000","404180"," If you're a seller, you're looking for that gamma to roll off the market into Monday, not to not"
"404180","405320"," right now at this moment."
"405340","411280"," So that weakness that you just saw on the opening bell is likely those SPX options that are"
"411280","411820"," expiring."
"412100","416980"," You're likely going to see spy it into the end of the day, some other stuff in the end of"
"416980","418780"," the day, expire as well. "
"419100","422880"," Now, what does that mean to the market?"
"423760","430560"," It means that the squeezing, the relentless squeezing that going higher can likely, there's an"
"430560","435240"," opportunity for that squeezing to be important."
"436700","444940"," Or for a seller at least, right, freeze the markets will unclench, or lack of a better word, or has"
"444940","448380"," the ability to unclench, but not today, Monday."
"448800","452660"," Okay, they're going to pin this Friday, OPEC's going to park this shit, they're going to get all"
"452660","453580"," their spreads paid. "
"454540","458480"," I don't see the doom today that you guys might out there might be seeing."
"459600","462880"," It's possible, we can talk about if there is doom, what to look for."
"463180","468620"," So right now, we're sitting on this this hourly trigger here, right?"
"469440","472760"," And this hourly trigger is influenced by the daily trigger. "
"472980","479140"," So we're going to talk about that to daily velocity matters on the hourly velocity and the hourly"
"479140","479600"," trigger."
"479980","484900"," So if if the daily trigger is was a couple of things here, prices blow the hourly trigger, that's"
"484900","485520"," bearish, right?"
"486460","493340"," Number two, you're going to expect support on the hourly trigger as the daily velocity is just"
"493340","494740"," ramping becoming bullish."
"495760","499240"," So let's say daily velocity was maxed out, right?"
"500260","505580"," And we came down into the hourly velocity, I'd expect us to break through and start to bust through"
"505580","506040"," and down. "
"507160","510960"," But for right now, daily velocity is just beginning to ramp."
"511260","515980"," So you're going to expect the hourly, maybe the daily, we might break through and go to the daily,"
"516100","519840"," but you're going to expect those to be supportive for more upside."
"520000","524240"," Now we're going to go over a bunch of crap here, I'm going to show you some examples too of,"
"524600","529200"," uh, prior examples of rotation in the market. "
"529400","537380"," So this role that we're expecting, I wouldn't be as bearish as some of you might be, uh, the"
"537380","539820"," expectation, like everything is normal, we're going to roll down."
"540000","544580"," I'm going to show you some prior examples of rotation in the market, where we can actually trade"
"544580","553620"," sideways and up to a full rotation and the downside move is not as severe as one might think it's"
"553620","554120"," going to be."
"554340","561680"," So if you're a bear out there, uh, we talk about this, the market breath indicator too. "
"563500","568860"," And sometimes you'll see market breath go down in that rotation and then ramp back up at price on"
"568860","572140"," spoos won't go down, follow down, right?"
"572320","575360"," Price is not following that rotation, not following that move down."
"575480","582220"," And there's a high probability of that happening in this, uh, in this, this week or two or even"
"582220","588580"," possibly into end of December with a ramp up end to end of December for the end of quarter."
"589520","593340"," So if you're a bear, this is probably the show for you. "
"593340","596120"," If you're a seller, this is probably the show for you."
"596180","598220"," You probably want to pay attention to this show today."
"598220","603900"," Uh, now Gemma is a concentrate between 4,545 and 15. "
"604460","609640"," The next node above it, I think I posted this on Twitter, is four, five, five, zero."
"609960","612620"," So there's another node above that we can go to from here."
"613280","614440"," Do I think we're going to pull back?"
"614720","614800"," Yes. "
"615000","615620"," Do I think we're going to rotate?"
"616080","616080"," Yes."
"616200","618380"," Do I think that we're going to trade sideways and down?"
"618860","618940"," Yes."
"619420","622920"," But not what I think that some of you think is going to happen here. "
"623340","624960"," We're going to go over like Mike Barry said."
"625060","627100"," Mike Barry's got a big short on the market, I guess."
"627400","628340"," I didn't know about that. "
"628560","629500"," I learned about it later."
"629760","633760"," And, uh, his big short, we'll talk about that."
"634020","637980"," And when it's going to be good, like when it's going to pay and stuff like that. "
"637980","642600"," And you know, I get like how long it can wait for that short pay and how much money he"
"642600","644080"," has versus you, that kind of stuff."
"644940","648220"," Well, he can look back in February, of course, and be like, yeah, fuck it."
"648220","648840"," I won, right?"
"649260","653280"," No, he doesn't care about November, December, uh, like you would. "
"653760","655180"," You're going to get a maintenance call."
"655320","657240"," You're going to get, you're going to get more than maintenance call you."
"657300","660340"," And we told to go fuck yourself, uh, and pay up. "
"660800","662020"," So we have to talk about that too."
"662820","666020"," We'll talk about, um, his bearishness, that kind of stuff."
"666780","669780"," And well, what kind of a role you should expect here. "
"669780","673120"," So, uh, we're going to go into that at some point now."
"673940","678260"," All that CTA buying that you've been seeing out there, right?"
"678480","679580"," I read something this morning."
"679580","682500"," People were like, yeah, fuck those CTA buyers. "
"683500","685620"," Don't, uh, believe that either."
"686620","688520"," That's real money buying in the marketplace."
"689200","693080"," Now, uh, there can be arguments made that late party and all that kind of stuff. "
"693260","699060"," But, uh, I'll tell you what, if CTA's weren't buying at the right times, they'd all be fucking"
"699060","699400"," bankrupt."
"699740","704820"," So, you know, like, uh, I'd be wary of that."
"705080","710780"," CTA's can actually, if they're buyers, net buyers, they can drive this market up or at least"
"710780","713680"," sideways and possibly up down the road. "
"713940","716120"," So, uh, be conscious of that."
"716400","716720"," Okay."
"716820","720620"," It doesn't mean we can't roll down, but not maybe where you think, right?"
"720920","722400"," Not maybe where you think it's going to go. "
"723520","726440"," Uh, so we'll talk about that this morning as well."
"726540","730460"," Those are some key points that I need you to understand though is that there's a, there's a window"
"730460","735140"," here into the next couple weeks, next week where there is an ability for us to go down."
"735600","737640"," Question becomes though, how much can we go down?"
"738160","741760"," And if the market is supportive on this hourly trigger, this daily trigger, let me say you're gonna"
"741760","743060"," bring that daily trigger up for you. "
"744460","747840"," This is where, this is where the seller wants, we'll show the seller's looking for here."
"749360","751120"," We'll sell it, let me put it on a 30 minute chart."
"752580","760860"," Yeah, that's seller wants the, the sellers are just drooling to, uh, have this halfback trade right"
"760860","761160"," here. "
"761480","762340"," Oh, this is something else."
"763040","765740"," Halfback trade down here and get all this right here, right?"
"766460","767560"," Uh, but this isn't guaranteed."
"767940","771540"," So, uh, and that's the big question mark. "
"771560","774200"," Where do you have to go to get that, right?"
"774380","777500"," That pullback is this all you get right there maybe."
"778860","781980"," And then we end up bouncing up and higher or do we get all this pullback?"
"782160","787280"," Look, there's a bunch of juiciness back here that sellers want when they like, seller, it, it, it,"
"787300","788020"," a seller's mind."
"788880","793080"," They look at all this and they're like, oh no, we're bringing all this back, right?"
"793320","797700"," You know, and their, and their version of the world, the seller's version, we're going to take all"
"797700","798480"," that back, right?"
"799780","801380"," Then start again, that's possible. "
"802320","804000"," Uh, but it might not be possible too."
"804060","805700"," You've got end of year stuff here."
"806820","808680"," And, uh, it's a little bit different. "
"808900","809840"," Seasonality is a little bit different."
"810780","812680"," Uh, so, but we'll look at it."
"812680","815900"," If we can break through that hourly trigger, hell yeah, I'll fall that down. "
"816480","819560"," Uh, look for that nice dip buy down here to take this up higher."
"821580","824460"," Uh, but that doesn't begin until Monday, okay?"
"824600","827660"," Is that the key point here is that, or it shouldn't, it shouldn't say it doesn't."
"828260","831100"," The market is freer on Monday, okay?"
"831980","834020"," Uh, so you got all these spreads, they're going to close today. "
"834180","837100"," And then, and then Monday is Tuesday, Wednesday of next week."
"837200","838980"," We should see a nice decent pullback."
"840720","842320"," So we'll chat about that right now. "
"842360","845940"," If you're a seller out there and you think you're going to be saved today, like today is your day,"
"846220","846820"," probably not."
"846820","849660"," The high probability that you're going to get mixed up."
"849780","852000"," Like, so sometimes they'll have calls, right?"
"852180","854360"," They get burned and I'll hold them. "
"854380","857860"," I'll be like, let's say I buy a call for a dollar and they go to 10 cents, right?"
"858160","865120"," Friday comes around and one out of every 10 times that happens to me, one."
"865980","869400"," Those calls will come back and I'll at least break even or make money."
"869620","870160"," So do you have a chance?"
"870540","873640"," Yeah, what's your chance today as a seller?"
"874240","876180"," Five percent, 10 percent. "
"876380","881940"," They're likely going to park today and you'll see that move that you're looking for or the ability"
"881940","885140"," for you to see that move is likely next week, not today."
"885540","888840"," So this is more of a positioning day for you."
"888900","894460"," If anything, I'd probably be waiting unless we see some kind of signs that we break the hourly"
"894460","895200"," trigger right here. "
"896000","899440"," Let me show it to you here at a one minute chart here."
"901820","909040"," Unless we begin to reject this, if we do, if we begin to reject this hourly trigger, which I"
"909040","910060"," haven't seen yet, right?"
"910300","914620"," Like, we broke through the hourly trigger here, came back up and right up here."
"914800","917380"," So what I'm looking for, I mean, this looks like a cell signal here. "
"918280","920160"," It looks like a liquidity grab to go lower."
"920520","921940"," This all looks pretty bearish here."
"923620","930420"," Keep making our way higher, but until I see that break of that over here, no, I need to see"
"930420","932340"," that break of that hourly trigger, that rejection. "
"932520","938280"," This stuff all has the makings of a downside move coming at the end of the day, but I'm going"
"938280","942380"," to tell you see, it's like I see that break in that hold and that this is actually liquidity down"
"942380","944460"," here, that kind of stuff."
"945220","946960"," No, this is kind of rejecting here."
"947080","949280"," I guess, I guess it looks a little bearish. "
"949680","951200"," I know VIX is looking at it."
"951260","952600"," We'll look at VIX at some point too."
"955520","957820"," But, you know, it's fucking Friday, man. "
"958040","958800"," I don't know, OPEC's weak."
"958980","960940"," I think we got OPEC's, the real OPEC's next week."
"961320","962200"," We got Thanksgiving coming. "
"962420","963280"," We got Christmas coming."
"963880","965660"," So we'll chat about that stuff as well."
"970890","973110"," Yeah, I know about, I know the CTA flow. "
"973370","976290"," It was what, 17 was it, 17 billion or something?"

"998770","1002710"," So if someone out there's telling you it's ended, I'm going to tell you that it is not."
"1003110","1008850"," GS has said that they're expected to buy another 17 to $38 billion next week."
"1009610","1012650"," So they're not done yet buying. "
"1012650","1015370"," So whatever you've heard about, like, CTA's are done buying."
"1015570","1020710"," I've got counter data here saying they're going to come in and swoop in and try to buy next week."

"1037210","1037790"," to expect. "

"1046839","1047880"," Oh, no, they're down a little."
"1048020","1048820"," Nope, nope, they're down. "
"1053240","1055340"," All right, so they're burning my calls already."

"1150280","1152100"," What is going on with this shit?"
"1154660","1158280"," Sorry, I'm watching my stuff over here and I'm like, I'm not paying attention like I should be"
"1158280","1159180"," paying attention to my calls."

"1222970","1224770"," Yeah, so let's start with COVID. "
"1225490","1232230"," So COVID, I caught COVID, I think two weeks ago, could have been, yeah, it's about two and a half"
"1232230","1236210"," weeks ago or something like Friday or something, I found it at Friday or Saturday or something like"
"1236210","1236390"," that."
"1236570","1237170"," No, is it Friday Saturday?"
"1237850","1240430"," Can't remember, I found, I was going into Halloween."
"1241430","1247670"," And I found like on Halloween weekend, that weekend of Halloween, I found out like as I rolled into"
"1247670","1249750"," the Halloween weekend, I found out I had COVID. "
"1250730","1253910"," And by Sunday, I was a fucking disaster."
"1254690","1257590"," And I think I was fine by Wednesday."
"1258490","1261670"," Came on streamed Wednesday, Thursday, I think Friday. "
"1262110","1264790"," And I started feeling like real shit again."
"1265990","1267490"," It kicked back in."
"1268050","1273230"," And by that weekend again, it got really, really, really bad. "
"1275310","1280350"," Brutal, like I had to go back to the doctor, had to take some tax-loved shit."
"1282270","1285610"," And I've never been that kind of sick in my life."
"1286250","1295010"," Now, on the first few days that I started streaming again, the problem for me with COVID was"
"1295010","1304790"," that I, for the first, enough, there's been three or four moments in my life where I didn't feel in"
"1304790","1305230"," control. "
"1306490","1310470"," Very rare, I was in a, I had someone try to kill me, I'm in a motorcycle once years ago,"
"1311390","1315330"," a guy tried to run me off the road, that was one of those times, there was two other times"
"1315330","1315950"," in the military."
"1315950","1323010"," And I had one fight once when I was young, where I thought I might die."
"1325230","1326990"," No, I didn't think I'd die. "
"1327470","1332090"," I didn't think I would die past couple weeks."
"1332690","1337730"," But what I did, I didn't trust myself."
"1338210","1338710"," It's hard to explain. "
"1338970","1344610"," I couldn't trust my own judgment, and it made me paranoid."
"1344610","1347350"," I'll be honest, it made me very scared."
"1348490","1353590"," I've never been that kind of, never had that in my life where I didn't trust myself. "
"1354690","1361090"," This is, this like goes back to like family too, like my family, my friends, my whole other side of"
"1361090","1364130"," my life that I have, I own Airbnb's and stuff."
"1364370","1372090"," And then it like, it like snowballs into, can you take care of your family?"
"1372090","1378790"," So it's like the first time in my life where I was scared that I might have lost an edge"
"1378790","1382030"," that I have in life, not the stock market."
"1382250","1383410"," This is just life in general. "
"1383610","1393170"," It involves the stock market too, but not, never in my life, even when I've been drunk or I've done"
"1393170","1399650"," drugs or anything, tired, three days, I could be, when I was in the army, sometimes I'd go almost"
"1399650","1401510"," 72 hours without sleep."
"1402630","1412410"," And even then, I still had a cognitive awareness, and I felt like I"
"1412410","1422010"," lost that edge, and it was very scary for me, and it also brought up, it also"
"1422010","1430890"," brought up like, can you make a decision, any decision that's important, like this is, I was trying"
"1430890","1434870"," to drive down the fucking road in my car, sober."
"1436390","1441150"," Fucked up on COVID and thought, I shouldn't be driving right now. "
"1443390","1449450"," Like, like, I'm driving on the road, bringing my daughter to school in the morning, and I'm telling"
"1449450","1454790"," myself on the road, I shouldn't be driving right now."
"1455250","1462830"," Like, and it was like pulling out of a light, take a left hand turn in traffic, coming against me"
"1462830","1464790"," making right hand turns, or you know what I mean?"
"1465270","1469590"," But like, in those moments where you like, almost like fine motor skills, I didn't have them."
"1470010","1474230"," And I felt like, I shouldn't be on the road, I got to talk to my, matter of fact, I"
"1474230","1478810"," had a conversation with my wife and kids, I had to have, sit them down in my living room, and"
"1478810","1485210"," have a family meeting and say, you know, and you know, as I'm like, men aren't supposed to have to"
"1485210","1490830"," do this, but I have a wife and daughters, and it is amasculating. "
"1491350","1494530"," Tell your, I'm probably going to get stopped out here."
"1496250","1498910"," Amasculating, it's very amasculating to me."
"1499250","1501150"," I like, I have daughters, not boys, right?"
"1501290","1504590"," I can't be a bad dad to my daughters, my boy probably. "
"1506310","1510370"," You know, so what happens to boys, you get told, you know, suck it up, move on, be an adult,"
"1510370","1512190"," take care of yourself."
"1512710","1514730"," Girls can't do that, wife can't do that."
"1514890","1521970"," I owe them, or they look to me as always being the person that will always be there no matter"
"1521970","1522090"," where. "
"1522190","1527570"," I'm the kind of guy that would push my wife and kids out of the way of a bus, and"
"1527570","1529130"," die for my wife and kids."
"1529390","1530030"," I shit you not."
"1530290","1533070"," So think about it from maybe that, maybe that's the easy way to describe it. "
"1533070","1540390"," So if, if there's a moment where, uh, internally in my brain, my id, my, my super ego, all this"
"1540390","1544350"," stuff is like, don't trust yourself."
"1546570","1548590"," And I'm like, what, what said it again?"
"1549670","1553410"," I haven't heard that voice, uh, very rare, I hear that voice."
"1553850","1559690"," And that voice was like a very rational, um, voice of reason saying you can't trust yourself right"
"1559690","1560170"," now, dude. "
"1561070","1564570"," And, uh, with anything, anything of consequence."
"1565470","1567590"," So, uh, very scary."
"1567970","1570350"," Now I've got to put on this, I'm back to the doctor. "
"1571230","1575990"," Got this, uh, five day, like, um, like a five day course of Pax Loven."
"1576850","1580470"," I felt good coming into Tuesday or Wednesday of this past week."
"1581130","1588490"," Now, saying that, first thing that's on my mind is, first thing that's on my mind is the week"
"1588490","1592210"," before I started feeling better and I wasn't. "
"1592410","1600830"," And my, my, my conscience was telling me, um, you have no business, uh, uh, you have no business"
"1600830","1602330"," making critical thought right now."
"1602810","1607210"," And so this past week here, I'm like, well, what if I go on stream on Wednesday?"
"1608550","1612610"," And it's, I start getting cloudy again or start getting cloudy on Thursday or Friday or any of that"
"1612610","1613130"," kind of stuff."
"1613690","1618230"," And I'll be honest with you, I'm not going to, you guys have, uh, millions of dollars. "
"1618230","1622990"," I, we've calculated how many people were influenced and over here with are you long?"
"1623210","1623510"," Are you short?"
"1623650","1625630"," All that kind of stuff and the impact that it makes."
"1625630","1633470"," And, uh, I'm, I'm unwilling to, um, stream or, or talk to anybody about, hey, you should do this or"
"1633470","1637170"," I should do this or you should do that or, hey, I'm, uh, matter of fact, there wasn't this whole"
"1637170","1637470"," run."
"1637510","1638170"," I haven't been long. "
"1639110","1643070"," Um, some of it I have, but most of it happens because I haven't trusted my own self, right?"
"1643150","1646670"," I have my trust, trust my own self as a trader, uh, past couple of weeks."
"1646670","1648850"," So that's the COVID stuff."
"1648850","1652970"," So, uh, just to wrap up the COVID conversation, I feel great. "
"1653750","1655490"," Uh, my brain feels correct."
"1656410","1659110"," Uh, my physical, I went out, worked out yesterday."
"1659110","1660170"," I felt good this morning. "
"1660430","1662890"," I worked out, gave a four, felt good, felt good yesterday."
"1663970","1666950"," Um, so my brain feels right."
"1667210","1668390"," My mind feels right. "
"1668850","1670250"," Everything feels right at this moment."
"1670250","1676470"," So it's felt right since I took that course, uh, this past week."
"1676750","1678790"," I took it this past week. "
"1678850","1681250"," So, um, I'm feeling good."
"1681550","1682390"," So I feel better."
"1682890","1683810"," I've taken a test. "
"1684030","1690090"," I haven't, I don't have any, um, lines going through the tests anymore."
"1690110","1692310"," So it's not stuck up inside my nasal."
"1692830","1696570"," I don't know if it's in my fucking veins and arteries and all that shit, but I'll tell you what,"
"1696670","1699670"," man, I'll tell you what, I don't know what your experience was. "
"1699670","1704230"," If you had COVID or not, if you haven't had COVID, I'll tell you what, you're going to notice that"
"1704230","1708170"," it's not, um, like having the flu or stripped road."
"1708650","1710070"," You can tell that it's something different."
"1710550","1711730"," Uh, and I've never had it. "
"1711810","1712490"," Never knowing that."
"1712550","1714430"," Even had an antibody test and never had it."
"1714570","1716410"," So this is the first time for me having it. "
"1716670","1722650"," I was feeling something this past week where I was like, fuck me, like, I tried to do everything I"
"1722650","1723410"," was supposed to do."
"1723650","1730070"," Like in the beginning of COVID, I was like, they're asking for time in the hospitals and time to"
"1730070","1730850"," find therapy."
"1731490","1736550"," I'm going to do what I'm supposed to do to not show up at a hospital to start COVID. "
"1737010","1738310"," I don't want to be a part of the problem."
"1738330","1742950"," I'd rather just like, hey, I'll just wait in the back and whenever you guys develop that shit to"
"1742950","1750010"," treat this shit and whenever you get over the hump of the influx of new impatience with COVID, I'll"
"1750010","1751870"," take my turn at it down the road."
"1752910","1757690"," Well, so my turn comes up and everyone in my life. "
"1757690","1758890"," This is all over my life."
"1758910","1763310"," Not just streaming, but everyone's like, oh, everything is, you know, because of course I'm not"
"1763310","1764910"," dealing with anything else in my life."
"1765350","1766470"," And he's dealt with either. "
"1766930","1771330"," Like whatever you guys are seeing me not here, the rest of my life, I'm not there either."
"1771790","1774130"," And it's like, it's like a doom and gloom."
"1774370","1776590"," It's like a nuclear bomb going off, right?"
"1776930","1779630"," Oh, oh, dad's in trouble and husband's in trouble. "
"1780830","1782750"," A loyal friend, he's in trouble."
"1783130","1790630"," Like, you know, it's like, you can't have a crack in the facade of being a man, being a husband,"
"1790790","1794190"," a father, all this other shit, all these other responsibilities that you have."
"1796170","1799630"," So, of course, paranoia rolls in like mass paranoia. "
"1799890","1801870"," I think my brain's going a million miles an hour."
"1802710","1806870"," So anyways, at this point right now, I feel good."
"1807610","1808370"," I do feel weird. "
"1808890","1814190"," Like, I feel like if I guess going back to that last product conversation was, you know, if I'd"
"1814190","1816210"," gotten sick in the beginning of COVID, I think everything great."
"1816490","1817630"," People like, yeah, I just got COVID."
"1817730","1818050"," Fuck them. "
"1818130","1820550"," We could be back in a couple of weeks getting COVID now."
"1820690","1824370"," It's like, because you because you stood in the back of the room and said, Oh, wait until"
"1824370","1825510"," everybody's already gotten COVID."
"1825890","1829250"," People are like, yeah, fuck that guy back there with that last asshole. "
"1829370","1830110"," It didn't catch COVID."
"1830210","1832790"," Fuck them, you know."
"1835470","1838270"," But whatever, I guess that comes with with waiting. "
"1838410","1839770"," So I got COVID."
"1840050","1841550"," So I have it had it."
"1842350","1845030"," And if you've had it, I had two people. "
"1845170","1848090"," No, three people, like one person real far out."
"1848750","1854490"," But three people, one person very close, some of the person that was a little bit distant and from"
"1854490","1855170"," extended family."
"1855470","1858150"," And then one person very far distant that died from COVID. "
"1858550","1859270"," So I know it's serious."
"1859510","1861670"," It can be for people."
"1861870","1864070"," But I'll tell you what, that shit was crazy. "
"1864750","1868090"," Like you, I didn't know right away right away."
"1868390","1870210"," When I first got sick, I was like, yeah, this is the flu."
"1870210","1872530"," Uh, but then it felt weird. "
"1872670","1873270"," It felt off."
"1873430","1874070"," It felt different."
"1874570","1877130"," And so, uh, anyways, I got it. "
"1877470","1878570"," Uh, I'm all that."
"1878730","1879670"," I have every vaccine."
"1880750","1882910"," Even this newest one I have, that vaccine. "
"1883030","1883810"," I've got the flu vaccine."
"1884210","1884730"," I've got them all."
"1884950","1886690"," Matter of fact, I got the, the newest vaccine. "
"1887510","1891150"," The day it was released where I live, that actual same day."
"1891170","1892670"," I didn't realize that that was the new vaccine."
"1892830","1894770"," I just showed up and they're like, yeah, we can take in. "
"1895230","1896070"," We just got the new vaccine."
"1896310","1898690"," And, uh, has it, has it blunted it?"
"1898690","1902150"," I don't know if it would have been worse if I wasn't vaccinated."
"1902610","1904010"," I'm an active person. "
"1904230","1906270"," Most of my life I've been very, like most."
"1907170","1911630"," I've been very, uh, a very physical person and very healthy."
"1911950","1917010"," And, um, I haven't lived a life of being set at entry. "
"1917250","1921790"," This is the first thing I've done in my life where I've sat in front of a desk all day"
"1921790","1922230"," long."
"1922870","1924030"," Like I do with you guys on stream."
"1924550","1927250"," Most of my life was spent on my feet. "
"1927250","1936130"," Uh, working, uh, working as an operations director of some kind or, uh, some kind of a leadership"
"1936130","1939990"," position that was in person, um, consulting."
"1940310","1942210"," It was never like, I never sat behind a desk."
"1942270","1943250"," It was never like my MO. "
"1943570","1952530"," So I think that might have something to do with my, uh, like, like, uh, I don't know, like, maybe"
"1952530","1957230"," has something to do with whether it was good or bad."
"1957230","1963930"," Um, I wish, like, I wish I was more active coming into this COVID, but I didn't spend 30 years"
"1963930","1966530"," or 20 years sitting behind a desk either."
"1966550","1971650"," So I think like it's like this mixed bag of, um, my reaction to COVID. "
"1971750","1973010"," I know that might not be true."
"1973470","1976850"," Some of it has to do with your, um, your, your, how your immune system."
"1977170","1981190"," Some of my, some of these guys are dying or like overreactive immune system. "
"1981770","1984210"," That's why it ends up killing them, but, uh, I feel good."
"1984890","1992510"," Um, yeah, the question to ask myself, is it the vaccine compromised by immune system, uh, making me"
"1992510","1994450"," more susceptible to infection?"
"1995090","1998890"," So I was, you, I'm the wrong guy to ask about that stuff."
"1999230","1999870"," I was in the army. "
"1999870","2001410"," I have the anthrax vaccine."
"2001510","2004110"," I've had every vaccine, uh, I've been deployed."
"2004750","2005810"," I've been around the world. "
"2005970","2007110"," I've traveled all over the world."
"2007110","2013550"," I can't travel without vaccines, uh, for me and my life, uh, I've, I've had a life of being"
"2013550","2014190"," vaccinated."
"2014530","2021410"," So whether it did or didn't, I don't know, uh, if it's, if I, if it, uh, compromise me, I"
"2021410","2022930"," mean, it, you know, compromise me or not. "
"2022930","2023570"," I don't know."
"2024110","2026490"," I just know that I've been vaccinated my entire life."
"2027730","2029210"," And I, and I have to be vaccinated. "
"2029510","2030530"," I, I try, I actually travel."
"2030710","2032670"," So, um, I have to be vaccinated."
"2033010","2033650"," I don't have a fucking choice. "
"2034450","2035590"," I guess not everywhere."
"2035770","2039990"," You don't have to be vaccinated, but most of the travel that I've done, I needed to be vaccinated."
"2041950","2043310"," Yeah, it was pretty bad, man. "
"2043530","2047530"," It wasn't, uh, what I, it wasn't what I expected to happen."
"2047969","2052850"," Dude, there was like first, when I first got sick, dude, I was like under a fucking, okay, here's"
"2052850","2055050"," how fucked up I'll be in sick with COVID was for me."
"2055250","2058070"," I don't know what it was like for you being sick, but here's what it was like for me. "
"2058989","2060469"," Uh, the first week, right?"
"2060650","2063909"," When I stopped streaming that first week, I was hiding under a blanket."
"2064710","2068429"," Like, uh, hiding felt better."
"2069130","2075570"," When it kicked back in, uh, the second time when it kicked back in, I was fine. "
"2076210","2079610"," Like, or I didn't have, I didn't have a noticeable temperature."
"2080050","2081989"," I didn't have like flu symptoms."
"2082909","2091010"," It was all in my, all, all in my, um, uh, like I said, like when I was driving, I"
"2091010","2091710"," didn't feel confident. "
"2092050","2096250"," Like that whole thing, um, it was a really fucking bizarre way to be sick."
"2096510","2097710"," It was really fucking bizarre."
"2097710","2104390"," So, um, I appreciate you guys all being here today with me on the stream, by the way, uh, I"
"2104390","2105010"," want you to know that. "
"2105910","2109350"," Um, in staying with, sticking with me, you know, I'm a fucking die, right?"
"2109470","2110450"," It's like, oh, shit, cap died."
"2110790","2115950"," And this, as a matter of fact, there's a few traders that I know of on Fen to it, uh,"
"2116110","2117410"," that have died in COVID."
"2117730","2124410"," There's actually some, it's actually a few like, uh, people that are like, they're the person, they"
"2124410","2125750"," ended up kicking the bucket from it. "
"2125750","2129210"," So, uh, I was like, yeah, I want to become that fucking person either."
"2129250","2130730"," Like boom, just captain's dead."
"2132210","2132970"," James, buh-bye. "
"2135050","2136550"," A lot of them taking a look at this."
"2136670","2137830"," They're going to try to send this shit down."
"2137970","2138470"," Hold on a second here. "
"2147980","2149580"," The HYG is going up right now."
"2150300","2151640"," All right, maybe I'll stay long here."
"2152460","2157880"," Okay, so let me go through some of what you guys are saying in the chat. "
"2158080","2159620"," I'm going to catch up with this to me, you guys in the chat."
"2159860","2163260"," Anyways, I don't know what to say to you guys."
"2165000","2168860"," Assuming everybody has a different reaction to COVID or how many times you've had it, that kind of"
"2168860","2172420"," stuff, uh, I know there's a lot of politics surrounding COVID. "
"2172420","2177480"," I don't want to ever get involved in any of that stuff, um, on a stream or anything like that."
"2177660","2181040"," And I, whatever views you guys have is fine."
"2181120","2184340"," You know, I'm okay with you guys having whatever your views are on it. "
"2185100","2187280"," Be okay with whatever my views are on it."
"2187360","2189620"," All I know is that we know it's real at least, right?"
"2190140","2192780"," And, uh, or at least I can tell you for sure that I got it."
"2192780","2196660"," And it was real for me, um, and I got sick. "
"2196960","2198240"," And it was, it was fucking brutal."
"2198460","2199620"," No, it wasn't brutal."
"2200020","2200900"," It could have gotten brutal. "
"2202440","2204780"," And, uh, I'm just grateful that it did."
"2205000","2205200"," I'm grateful."
"2205420","2205840"," I'm still here. "
"2205860","2207360"," I'm grateful that I haven't lost anything."
"2207400","2210800"," Like I'm counting my fucking fingers and my brain and stuff."
"2211120","2216740"," Taking tests every day, uh, see if having any mental decline, that kind of stuff. "
"2217540","2219140"," And, uh, but I feel fine."
"2219260","2220840"," I feel good and my brain feels right."
"2220840","2222880"," So, well, you guys know that as well. "
"2223400","2225100"," Let me read some of you guys are saying in the chat real quick."

"2236900","2238880"," HYG is just fucking ripping right now."
"2239900","2242820"," Even though the spy is going to likely be pending this close. "
"2243720","2244400"," We're on one second here."
"2246220","2249480"," Let me go into the room here and see what you guys are saying."
"2256070","2258490"," I see that I see that study never ends. "
"2259630","2262370"," Do lots of physical stuff at work of crazy foot pain or like muscle spouse."
"2262370","2265010"," Apparently I just found out I need us to, uh, oh, damn it."
"2265590","2265950"," Herms. "
"2269250","2271070"," Yeah, we got to talk about IWM too."
"2271430","2275190"," I'll write that one down because we got a big, we got a big talk about IWM."
"2275750","2279390"," I was going to make a post earlier in the week saying expect a rotation into it. "

"2287810","2293990"," Uh, I just should have, I'm, so I have that, had that post and I didn't fucking post that I"
"2293990","2295850"," wanted to tell people to buy fucking IWM."

"2299490","2301250"," That was a little bit early, but it didn't matter. "
"2306050","2307750"," Thanks, thanks to the point."
"2312830","2317210"," Yeah, I had the high fever, like fever, no fever, fever, no fever wrapped up in the blanket"
"2317210","2318910"," underneath and a coon, all that kind of stuff."

"2405240","2406780"," The whole family got COVID at the worst. "
"2406780","2407820"," Really thought I was going to die."
"2408860","2415200"," Yeah, that, I think, um, I want to say one thing about that."
"2415520","2419780"," I was talking to Joe Donut earlier this week, and I was like, man, I was like, I was like,"
"2419840","2420820"," that fucking feeling dude. "
"2421440","2425280"," I was like, that, I was like, no, I was like, let's try to express this."
"2426800","2429600"," I read about COVID and stuff like that, but."
"2429600","2435700"," I needed someone to say to me like, it's like being a child, an adult, an adult tells you something"
"2435700","2438500"," and you don't believe it and it happens and you go, holy fuck. "
"2439200","2445660"," When that person said they were scared, um, the weight, the weightiness of it didn't really matter"
"2445660","2446240"," to me."
"2448380","2450480"," Uh, oh, yeah, baby, keep on climbing."
"2451080","2457920"," Um, the weight, the weightiness of the paranoia, the scared of damage being done. "
"2458200","2459040"," That's the biggest one."
"2459040","2463040"," That's the one that's like frightening of all of the COVID shit."
"2463220","2465340"," That's the one that got me, uh, the paranoia. "
"2466000","2470120"," Have I fucking damaged myself permanently?"
"2471100","2473540"," Uh, my brain, fuck my arms, fuck my hands."
"2474240","2475320"," We not fuck that stuff."
"2475520","2477980"," Not fuck my lungs, all that other stuff you can get hurt with. "
"2478800","2484460"," My brain, man, like my brain to me is like, it's not the smartest brain in the world."
"2485000","2485440"," It isn't."
"2485520","2486320"," They've taken IQ tests. "
"2486320","2490780"," So we got like 130 or 120 or something, 120 or 130 somewhere in there."
"2490940","2500020"," But, um, but like losing your faculty of your brain is like, fuck, like that is the, that's the one"
"2500020","2506180"," that got me, uh, super scared, super."
"2507880","2510040"," Um, you could cut my fucking arm off. "
"2510040","2511360"," I'd still be with you."
"2512000","2513760"," Cut my legs off."
"2514180","2523480"," I would, I'd, but the faculty, the mental faculty, that's the one that, um, uh, is, that's the one,"
"2523600","2523720"," man. "
"2523880","2524300"," That's the one."
"2524440","2527220"," That's the one no matter what your mental faculty is."
"2527440","2531720"," Like if you lose that mental faculty, that's the one that freaks me out the most. "
"2532200","2534920"," You just like fucking box me up and ship me out seriously."
"2535780","2539080"," I gotta, I gotta have my, uh, my wits about me."
"2545660","2549560"," So I'm reading through, uh, Twitch right now, we're reading through Twitch right now. "
"2551480","2552100"," Uh, yeah."
"2552420","2553100"," We'll be, some are said."
"2553280","2553580"," We'll be funny. "
"2553740","2555220"," We stayed at 450 all day long."
"2555480","2559080"," We'll, we'll go over to, um, SPX and check out SPX really quick."
"2562860","2568680"," SPX on a 451 right here. "
"2569380","2572020"," It's really where they want to close right up in here somewhere."
"2574910","2576410"," Right up there is where they want to close."
"2576410","2581550"," The next node is way above, it's at, uh, 455 up here. "
"2589670","2590210"," All right."
"2590250","2593730"," We're going to do some, we're going to do some, yeah, right there."
"2593730","2594150"," There it is. "
"2594210","2595190"," This is that green bars there."
"2595270","2596550"," I already put the green bar up there."
"2597870","2603390"," This is your next level to the upside up here that you're trying to get to if you're a bull. "
"2604990","2609330"," And, uh, that freeing of the gap in the market doesn't mean we go down."
"2609430","2611590"," It just means we'll talk about that too."
"2612030","2614370"," Now we're going to think about some, some key levels here. "
"2614510","2619950"," Let me get over to this, um, I'm going to get over, we're going to get over to, hold on"
"2619950","2623310"," one second here, we're going to, uh, trigger screen here."
"2623710","2624070"," Sweet."
"2625250","2629310"," And we're going to talk about a 30 minute chart here. "
"2630130","2632370"," We're going to look at a 30 minute spy chart, okay?"
"2639110","2640150"," Hang tight one second."
"2640330","2640690"," Hold on here."
"2640930","2650630"," I got, I got to give myself a, so we'll go to, let's go to spy. "
"2651370","2653390"," We'll just, we'll translate this to spy."
"2653990","2655350"," We'll get fucking spy dude."
"2656270","2656770"," So stupid. "
"2658870","2660450"," Okay, here's spy, okay?"
"2661610","2664890"," Um, this is what I want to tell you, okay?"
"2665750","2672080"," If you're a seller, you need to get underneath the hourly trigger here, okay?"
"2674020","2675600"," You need to get under there right there."
"2677160","2684200"," And you need to do some rejecting with, you need to get, you need to do some, some rejecting of"
"2684200","2684660"," consequence."
"2686580","2691580"," So we need to see like the breakdown and the rejection, right?"
"2692880","2695060"," And then you start following it down, right?"
"2696500","2697400"," You see what I'm saying here?"
"2697680","2700940"," If you like trying to get this down right here, you need to get that rejection. "
"2701480","2705500"," So rule number one, if you're a seller, you can't short here."
"2705500","2710980"," I'm sorry until you break that hourly trigger, okay?"
"2712560","2719420"," And you, you really don't want to long this either at the moment."
"2719640","2723680"," So there's not a ton to do right now, is there?"
"2724500","2726140"," There's not a ton to do here. "
"2727260","2732940"," Now, if you really did want to get above this stuff here, let's talk about that right now."
"2732940","2739660"," So we're gonna, let me see how I was saying, let me get rid of that sidebar right there."
"2739940","2741020"," Hold on one second here. "
"2742220","2745260"," Can I show you guys my, uh, sweet."
"2745860","2753440"," Okay, so then don't mind the scroll bar down there while I was sick."
"2755380","2759760"," So while I was sick, not streaming, I did a bunch of work. "
"2760080","2762220"," So don't worry about the scroller down there."
"2763080","2769200"," It doesn't mean anything to you right now, but I made a bunch of training videos and educational"
"2769200","2771080"," videos and that kind of stuff."
"2771120","2772860"," It's going to get released publicly here in a minute. "
"2773320","2777580"," Now, what I want you to see here is, uh, hold on here."
"2778020","2779860"," I'll, I'll put my scroller over here."
"2780400","2781240"," Can I bring this right here?"
"2783080","2788280"," Okay, so I want you to, I want you to see this bar right here, this gamma bar right here,"
"2788340","2788540"," okay?"
"2788540","2792920"," This gamma bar is that, uh, so right here we've got, uh, 4,500, right?"
"2794340","2796140"," Next one here is that 4,515. "
"2798020","2798420"," Okay."
"2800020","2802680"," So you got 4,500, 4,515."
"2803720","2805700"," The next one above it is 4,550. "
"2807200","2809220"," And then we've got a 4,600 here."
"2810380","2814420"," So this 41, uh, 4,515, we need to get above it."
"2814680","2818340"," To get what I'm saying, we have to get above this number to start, uh, taking some longs here to"
"2818340","2819580"," get up to that 4,550. "
"2820820","2825140"," So 4,515 on SPX, let me switch back over here again."
"2829270","2832930"," Let's go back to SPX over here."
"2836080","2838000"," I'll just dump all this shit here. "
"2839080","2839560"," Let me get simple."
"2842060","2843840"," So here's SPX right here, right?"
"2843980","2845840"," This 4,500, 4,515."
"2851050","2852710"," Here's that node right there. "
"2853450","2861630"," You have another node just above it right here, okay?"
"2863250","2866430"," Uh, and we'll switch back and forth for you, okay?"
"2866610","2868530"," So you got, so you got this node right here."
"2869830","2871910"," And you got this node right here."
"2872570","2876030"," And the market is parked right fucking here. "
"2877350","2881730"," So the market's parked right sitting right here, you know?"
"2881730","2888050"," So we need to get a butt, we need to get above this node right here to start taking some"
"2888050","2888690"," longs."
"2889230","2898500"," So if we go back to the triggers here, just like I'm telling the sellers out there, you got to"
"2898500","2899980"," get underneath the hourly trigger, right?"
"2900780","2902940"," Telling sellers, they have to get underneath this, right?"
"2903260","2905480"," Start rejecting to take the short."
"2906300","2908860"," Same thing applies for longs. "
"2909120","2911120"," Need to get above, right?"
"2911500","2912860"," And actually sit up here."
"2914180","2915680"," And start to go higher."
"2916240","2918260"," I don't care about these squeezes here. "
"2919140","2921320"," I don't care about, even about this squeeze."
"2924060","2928520"," If this squeeze is up, I don't even care about that."
"2928660","2933540"," I just care about coming back down and then that confirmation on that node. "
"2934280","2935840"," And then we're off and running to the upside."
"2936400","2937720"," So is there a trade here for bulls?"
"2938040","2938560"," Probably not."
"2938940","2940820"," Is there a trade here for bears?"
"2941020","2941840"," Probably not. "
"2941840","2944980"," You need to wait for that squeeze up confirmation."
"2945860","2947500"," And then we're off and running."
"2947680","2950560"," Or you're waiting for that break below. "
"2951500","2953720"," The hourly trigger, the rejection, the rejection."
"2954520","2955820"," And then we start heading to the downside."
"2956760","2958040"," Makes sense to you guys out there. "
"2958540","2962060"," So that's all this gamma crap that's over."
"2962700","2964500"," That's all this gamma crap that's over here."
"2964680","2966000"," Oh, we're sitting, go back to that. "
"2966740","2969180"," That's over here on the left-hand side here, okay?"
"2970000","2976320"," So if you're looking for this over here, if you're looking for that 4550, that 4600, that next"
"2976320","2976560"," move."
"2976800","2978760"," We'll see if they start loading the fuck up on puts."
"2979420","2981440"," That'll propel us up to that 4600. "
"2981580","2986520"," Or if they load up on a bunch of calls and then they send us back down back in."
"2987180","2990980"," So on this trigger screen, right?"
"2991280","2995240"," So see that hourly has not been broken yet on that SPX, right?"
"2996280","3001360"," If you're looking for that break, you need to see that break so we can take this bad boy back"
"3001360","3006680"," down and take out that 43.55, which will likely be up here at that point."
"3008180","3015340"," Expectations so far would be into next week that we pull down and take out at least this here and"
"3015340","3016680"," possibly this right here. "
"3017220","3021020"," But I don't know if you're going to get much more than that is my point here."
"3021680","3025880"," So as these days progress and we've got a short week next week, you've got the CTA supposedly"
"3025880","3027620"," coming back and do some more buying."
"3028500","3030700"," Likely going to be looking for a dip buy next week. "
"3031440","3040340"," Somewhere down at 4468 or possibly even as low as 4414 down here."
"3042820","3043300"," 4414."
"3043780","3045800"," I have a little blood right now on S&P 500. "
"3046780","3048360"," There, come back to this main screen."
"3053230","3054890"," Stay right here and put this back up."
"3063470","3065170"," I'll bring this over here for you. "
"3067990","3070310"," So that node we're stuck on, right?"
"3070510","3072170"," I just showed you the nodes that we're stuck on."
"3072310","3076670"," If you now know the nodes that are above that 4550, that 4600."
"3079600","3081880"," Let's see here, I got more stuff to go over here. "
"3086060","3087480"," Give me one quick second here, guys."
"3094580","3096360"," Why is VIX not coming up for me?"
"3099040","3100660"," Well, I have problems here in my end."
"3101900","3102840"," Come on now. "
"3105760","3107400"," I'm not showing VIX right now."
"3107940","3108420"," I don't know why."
"3115460","3117020"," Why am I not showing?"
"3117520","3118380"," Give me one quick second here, guys. "
"3128980","3129780"," I'm not on text."
"3133340","3134500"," Why does this not work?"
"3134700","3135540"," Give me one quick second here, guys."
"3135640","3136600"," I got some stuff going on the background. "
"3144040","3144600"," That's odd."
"3146380","3149660"," I'm not showing my VIX gamma here."
"3157510","3159930"," All right, I guess I'm not going to show you my seasonality today. "
"3159930","3161050"," I guess fuck me, huh?"
"3166540","3168800"," I'm going to show you guys the seasonality chart here."
"3168840","3174060"," I'm going to show you the sideways expectation of sideways, but I got nothing for you here."
"3178020","3181060"," My seasonality chart is like, shit, no, wait a minute. "
"3181380","3183660"," Wait a minute, hold on a minute, I haven't here."
"3185700","3186360"," There we go."
"3188380","3189100"," Come on, baby. "
"3196810","3199230"," This is going to move this over now."
"3200590","3202330"," Come on, it's like a chat box."
"3204870","3207850"," I'll move that over right there. "
"3208950","3212550"," Move that chat box up right there."
"3216830","3221630"," So you've got the seasonality chart here, right, came back down, blasted down right here, blasted"
"3221630","3222290"," back up."
"3222470","3224170"," That all matches up right there, right?"
"3224770","3232310"," You've now got a seasonal sideways action here, dipped down into the end of the year, and then"
"3232310","3234610"," squeezed up into the bell. "
"3236510","3239670"," You got this ahead of you right here."
"3240210","3243710"," Now I'm going to give you some targets here."
"3250100","3258800"," This is the 241st trading day where you get that last little move down, and then the squeeze up"
"3258800","3260020"," into the close here. "
"3260240","3267080"," So the expectation would be that we trade up and down sideways, get a little bit of bloodbath in"
"3267080","3271900"," the end of December, and then up into the close, you get some kind of a rip higher."
"3272640","3276740"," So what would that mean for you into the next couple of weeks would be to look for a bottom"
"3276740","3277720"," to buy, right?"
"3278160","3283940"," Look for some kind of, you got this pushup right here, until next week you get a down week."
"3284800","3288040"," Remember we talked about the CTA's coming in to buy, right?"
"3288380","3291320"," CTA's coming in here, trying to buy into the end of the year. "
"3291860","3296240"," You already know that CTA's are behind for the year, so there's going to be some kind of an"
"3296240","3300840"," expectation that we squeeze up into December 31st, right?"
"3302680","3308980"," Now you might say, well, hey, Cap, we don't always follow this exact, we don't, and we have"
"3308980","3311220"," oversized moves up and down."
"3311220","3316120"," We had an oversized move back here before we ever got to the top over here, right?"
"3317760","3322520"," Started bleeding off before we ever got there, came back down, right?"
"3322680","3324700"," A little bit of an oversized move down, right?"
"3325240","3326000"," Oversized move up."
"3326820","3330800"," Notice a lot of that, so you didn't expect some kind of an oversized move to the upside and at"
"3330800","3331340"," the end of the year. "
"3332160","3334800"," So let's look into that right now."
"3335240","3338080"," Let's go back to, let's go over to the Weebold chart here."
"3359530","3366790"," But I got all over there, but I didn't make that larger. "
"3367170","3371690"," This is the 29th right here."
"3375230","3376670"," There's your 29th right here."
"3380790","3382130"," Let's raise this up a little bit. "
"3388810","3392170"," Here's December 29th over here, the 1st of the year, right?"
"3392330","3399070"," The expectation would be that you have kind of consolidation down in here and then some kind of a"
"3399070","3403030"," move up into the 31st."
"3403390","3406610"," Whether that move up is only right here, your expectations, maybe you're up here."
"3407210","3410010"," This is that previous high at 4.59, something like that. "
"3410330","3415230"," So if you're going to get any kind of a chance to buy a dip, if you see the CTAs"
"3415230","3417510"," come in, they don't even care if we continue down, do they?"
"3418190","3422490"," They just know that they can buy that dip and come up into the end of this year and get"
"3422490","3423110"," paid, right?"
"3423110","3424950"," So they're not going to care about any of this kind of stuff."
"3425410","3433210"," You're going to be looking for some place to buy a dip into the end of the year."
"3433770","3436710"," Now, how, looking at this chart right here, right?"
"3436850","3437570"," It's pretty simple, right?"
"3438730","3440450"," We'll draw something in here for you. "
"3443740","3448380"," Let's say we just draw something like this first week of the month here, 7th, right?"
"3448560","3453220"," This is when you get the normal inflows in, normal inflows into the market in the beginning of the"
"3453220","3453380"," month."
"3454540","3457220"," It's at least something up in here like this, okay?"
"3457920","3461380"," That's at least the expectation, something like this right here."
"3462260","3468620"," Now, if you're looking for that doom and gloom that Mike Barrie is looking for, or if you're"
"3468620","3474140"," looking for that doom and gloom, you like, hit cap Mike Barrie's short and it's going to start"
"3474140","3476940"," fucking sending it down to the depths of how we're going to crash. "
"3477980","3481340"," So you're like, we are in the Mike Barrie's short or something like that more than likely."
"3481340","3484560"," We're going to go back over to, all right, we're going to have to go back over."
"3484680","3488620"," I'm just going to go back over to the big bar that you need to be. "
"3490660","3504210"," That's 434.50 and"
"3504210","3533660"," 434.35. So"
"3533660","3538700"," worst case scenario, if you're a seller, look at something here."
"3538740","3544820"," If you're a seller, I want you to know that we can go all the way down to 4.30"
"3544820","3545280"," down here."
"3546260","3548400"," Go all the way down here and still be bullish. "
"3550020","3556280"," So the title of today's show and the title of, I think I posted this, I think I posted this"
"3556280","3560560"," on Twitter earlier this morning, which was, we'll have much bearishness you have out there."
"3560620","3565280"," If you're a seller, you should temper your expectations and downside moves."
"3565720","3572840"," You literally need to be underneath this white box for that Michael Barrie crash. "
"3573200","3576560"," Okay, so down here, you'll be way down there."
"3577340","3579260"," Okay, so I'm going to give you some key levels here."
"3579920","3584140"," You want to snap this for yourself at home, the expectation of where we're going to go. "
"3584840","3586220"," There's going to be something like this."
"3586540","3592780"," My expectation is that it's going to go straight up, but, well, no, that's not my expectation."
"3593800","3597100"," The expectation is this, right here. "
"3597740","3598780"," Theta gang, baby."
"3600560","3608440"," And then some kind of stupidity like this up into some kind of stupidity into the end of the year."
"3609160","3613220"," Now, are you going to be able to grab like some kind of like doom and gloom down here, possibly?"
"3614500","3617300"," Keep your eyes on this down here for a dip buy. "
"3617540","3623020"," If you're a greedy bull, you're going to be looking for this target to buy down here."
"3623220","3628780"," If you're like me and you make your money from this market through spreads and stuff like that,"
"3629460","3630620"," that's me down here."
"3630880","3633800"," That's me trying to grab this and just swinging this straight up here. "
"3634060","3641100"," So full port, if you're a bull down here, if you're a bear, my expectation is that we don't"
"3641100","3647840"," actually trade that deep, that we trade for 40 at best down here."
"3648060","3650580"," For 40 at best is my expectation."
"3651720","3658020"," Now that we're like you have like a 30 to 40% chance that we trade this right here, maybe"
"3658020","3658480"," even more. "
"3659060","3660760"," I'd say like 40%."
"3661240","3664120"," You have a 30% chance of trading this right here."
"3664800","3665880"," You have like a 15%. "
"3667880","3670080"," And you got another 15 down here, let's say."
"3670460","3671780"," I'll give that another 15 down there."
"3671900","3672560"," Not 5%. "
"3672560","3673240"," You can go down here."
"3673300","3675580"," It's pretty reasonable to go down this deep."
"3676840","3679960"," But if you think we're going to crash down here, you got like a 5% chance. "
"3681560","3685660"," But a 5% chance you get that big crash that Mike Bari is looking for."
"3686720","3690380"," So expectations from here on out into next week."
"3692060","3695340"," We get a roll and some consolidation down to 440. "
"3696900","3700820"," And you're going to find that we're going to run up into December."
"3701900","3704040"," Worst case scenario, 434, 430."
"3706360","3709860"," For that again, trade up into the close on the 31st. "
"3709860","3711480"," It might not happen until down here."
"3712780","3714800"," But that's the expectation, okay?"
"3715620","3720820"," So if you're a theta gang person, it's a great fucking theta gang trade."
"3720940","3721560"," And here isn't it?"
"3721900","3723420"," It's a beautiful theta gang trade. "
"3724560","3730240"," So everybody's going to be flexing themselves in the next week or two to be trading flies."
"3730680","3736280"," This is like a perfect fly setup into end of month or end to end of quarter."
"3737420","3744920"," So anyways, down in here, this is the expectation into end of the year and then expectation for"
"3746220","3748620"," where the market goes from here forward. "
"3752680","3754680"," You prefer the straight up expectation."
"3755600","3756920"," We can go straight up."
"3757160","3758880"," I'm going to show you guys one last thing here. "
"3759320","3761780"," So career logists say prefer the straight up expectation."
"3762960","3764980"," So can I check out XBI?"
"3765240","3765820"," Yeah, I'll look at XBI."
"3767240","3768400"," So we're going to look at XBI. "
"3770120","3771700"," Fucking are we rolling again?"
"3772760","3773680"," God damn it."
"3776720","3778540"," I'm going to pull the plug on these calls here."
"3780880","3783460"," So we're going to show one more thing here for you, okay?"
"3784280","3785880"," So I do want you to realize something. "
"3786960","3789000"," You can I want you to see this right here."
"3789180","3790520"," Take a snapshot of this at home."
"3790960","3792820"," I want to do one more for you, okay?"
"3793640","3796720"," Remember what we talked about about 10 minutes ago. "
"3797420","3806770"," I said to you, if we get above at any point over here, if we get above those two nodes,"
"3807030","3807190"," right?"
"3807830","3812410"," So next week, we come in and those CTA's come in, right?"
"3812670","3815450"," And they buy next week, right?"
"3815590","3817030"," We got four days left next week, right?"
"3817290","3818710"," One, two, three, four."
"3819710","3823170"," If they buy and we start heading above here, all bets are off."
"3823690","3828070"," So if you're a bear seller, and you see any of this nonsense over here, right?"
"3828570","3832930"," And we get above that node, that gamma node up here, right?"
"3833150","3839770"," Hey, cap told me that we're going to go down to, I don't know, fucking 440, 434, 430 down here. "
"3840190","3845010"," And we're way up here right now and you're a seller, get out of the way because we're going to"
"3845010","3850750"," run up here and we're actually going to run up into all time highs."
"3850750","3857570"," I don't even want to talk about that yet in this stream, but getting above this one here, we'll set"
"3857570","3859890"," up an attempt to take this out right here."
"3859950","3864410"," This is that previous high from summertime and actually to go way, way higher. "
"3864710","3865850"," Go up there and tag that 480."
"3867590","3873470"," 4,800, maybe not by the 31st, maybe like the first week or two of January."
"3873930","3878950"," But if you're a seller, I want you to be very conscious of this box right here. "
"3879510","3881790"," This is on your mind at all times."
"3882070","3887530"," If price goes above this box right here, I want you to get out of the way, okay?"
"3888230","3892790"," Anything up here, get out of the way because they're going to nail this one, grind all this out,"
"3893370","3898170"," and then start slamming us up there and start chasing that all time high, believe it or not."
"3898390","3907090"," So if you're a bear, any movement in price above that node, get out of the way, okay?"
"3907690","3913190"," Because that will, that will x out all of this stuff down here if you're a seller, okay?"
"3914610","3921250"," I'm going to delete this right now because I don't want it on my one minute chart or whatever. "
"3921610","3924410"," So let's do a, let's do a five minute chart for next week here."
"3926190","3930670"," Dude, what the fucking murder in my goddamn calls over these motherfuckers, dude."
"3931130","3932770"," I swear I wouldn't swear this week. "
"3933290","3934090"," Just were pretty bad."
"3934850","3936950"," Now, so expectations in the next week."
"3937970","3944290"," We'll make this into a smaller chart here that you can eat more easily digest for just the upcoming"
"3944290","3945050"," week, okay?"
"3946710","3948990"," Hold on here, let me get rid of my fucking camera. "
"3951050","3952850"," I'm going to swear it already."
"3954190","3955530"," So expectations in the next week."
"3955690","3959790"," I'd already told you or showed you that node up here, right?"
"3960410","3969440"," So if you're a seller, and you don't want to get a margin call, maintenance call, somewhere up in"
"3969440","3971540"," here, if we get above, what's going on here?"
"3978470","3980950"," If we get above this white box up here, right?"
"3981330","3983690"," Put your, put your long pants on, okay?"
"3986410","3993670"," Now, without that happening right now on, on a, on a Friday into next week, right?"
"3994030","3996010"," Into next week, the expectation is we're going to trade. "
"4016400","4018300"," Let me make that green right there."
"4025280","4027960"," Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday."
"4029240","4029680"," Sweet. "
"4029960","4031260"," We'll close this day right here."
"4032080","4033920"," So this is your dip buy for next week."
"4034320","4035780"," You're just looking for that bad boy. "
"4036680","4037960"," Dude, I got some weirdness coming on."
"4038860","4039920"," Come down into Wednesday."
"4040720","4042060"," Boom, that's your dip buy right there. "
"4042380","4043840"," That's what you're looking for right down there."
"4043840","4053700"," If we go trade above that node, we're going to long the fuck out of this up"
"4053700","4054140"," here too."
"4055840","4056820"," Right up there. "
"4058980","4060180"," Those are my expectations."
"4060920","4065100"," Now, if we break that 440, we start getting around this 440, and this daily trigger starts rolling"
"4065100","4068580"," down on us, but that hourly trigger starts rolling down on us down there."
"4069300","4072980"," Your next expectation is going to be way, way lower. "
"4083230","4084430"," Way down there."
"4086710","4088730"," Let me bring this up for you right there."
"4092450","4095470"," Okay, so if you're if you're a bull, what are you doing?"
"4096470","4097170"," Buy in the dip. "
"4097470","4098149"," You're a bull."
"4098350","4098770"," What are you doing?"
"4099149","4099689"," Buy in the dip."
"4100510","4103470"," If we get above, are you buying this dip?"
"4104510","4106270"," You should say, fuck you cap. "
"4106529","4106630"," No."
"4108890","4111810"," If we buy this dip though, fuck you cap."
"4113330","4117490"," Fuck yes, we buy that dip, and we continue to the upside. "
"4119130","4122290"," As of right now though, expectation into next week."
"4123510","4126290"," Close out, come down into next week."
"4126649","4131390"," Look for a dip to buy for the end of the year, New Year's. "
"4132109","4134770"," How long will it take for this to print for you?"
"4136609","4138890"," All right, how long will this take for you to print?"
"4139490","4141210"," Likely into the end of the year."
"4141870","4146090"," Don't be buying down here, and then if you come back down here, and then we go back up, don't"
"4146090","4147689"," be like, get comfortable with my call spreads."
"4148609","4156270"," You just hang on to those call spreads into the 31st of the year, unless we start getting some, let"
"4156270","4157790"," me see if I can go over to this trigger screen. "
"4159410","4164130"," You're looking for, is this the trigger screen, the 30 minute trigger screen for the chart here,"
"4164270","4164390"," right?"
"4166990","4176880"," The only way you're not going to hold on to those call spreads, is if you see"
"4176880","4181540"," price break down next week, right?"
"4183779","4185160"," Gets underneath, right?"
"4185600","4187899"," Slams down, maybe doom and gloom down here at 430."
"4189819","4197740"," Ricochet is back up, and that hourly trigger comes back down here, rejects it."
"4201210","4202570"," That's what I'll start telling you. "
"4202710","4207710"," Fuck no, get rid of your call spreads, and we're going downtown for Christmas."
"4208030","4210870"," We're going to shit all over the bulls and all that other kind of stuff, okay?"
"4211570","4214510"," So unless this happens, then I'll start getting bearish."
"4214650","4218230"," Otherwise, it's buy a fucking dip right here, buy a fucking dip down here. "
"4218830","4224990"," So for right now, temper your expectations as a seller right now."
"4225790","4234130"," If you're a bear, usually, you want to be waiting until December 31st."
"4235030","4240250"," Sometimes the first week of just January, sometimes the second, third week of January, but you"
"4240250","4246390"," should not be looking for that, Mike Barry trade, until that happens. "
"4247110","4249550"," Now, we're going to go over a couple other things here, okay?"
"4250810","4254810"," We're going to go over a couple other things that I have to go over with you, and what backs"
"4254810","4255870"," up what I'm saying here."
"4256470","4265000"," I got to talk to you guys why I'm saying this, why it matters, and the biggest one is the"
"4265000","4266160"," velocity here, okay?"
"4266580","4267980"," Wait a minute, look at this velocity here."
"4276560","4282220"," Lower high here, the velocity, this is good, going a pullback, but not topped out yet. "
"4283020","4285140"," It's at 15 bullishness right now."
"4285260","4291260"," It should be at 5.25 or even 50 in velocity to the upside, okay?"
"4291880","4293060"," So we're not quite there yet."
"4293220","4294840"," We're actually ramping down here. "
"4295280","4299000"," Come down to a low, come back up to a high, right?"
"4299360","4303400"," Still not that plus 25 yet, but we should get there and then come back down."
"4303860","4305100"," So this is your next week, right?"
"4305300","4305980"," Buy it and come up."
"4308910","4313150"," So velocity is on the bull's side for right now, on the daily at least. "
"4313430","4317450"," That doesn't mean we can't come down over here in hourly velocity to come back up."
"4318510","4320470"," So maybe you have some weakness in the next week."
"4320850","4323510"," Let me roll higher here after next week. "
"4323670","4326670"," So that would imply that we come back down here, hit that daily trigger."
"4327230","4329110"," Then we're off and running again to the upside."
"4329450","4331250"," See that hourly velocity comes down?"
"4331950","4333610"," A little bit of cooling on the daily velocity. "
"4334570","4336610"," Then we start running again to the upside."
"4338010","4344590"," So at least on spy right now, I would say that we're not like, hey, sell, get out of the"
"4344590","4344870"," market."
"4346310","4348590"," We're not like, hey, we're at the top, we're topping out over here. "
"4348690","4349650"," It's not like back over here."
"4349790","4351090"," We got all this stuff going on."
"4351310","4352810"," See how we just keep grinding higher right here?"
"4356080","4360620"," See this grind higher, grind higher, grind higher, then we start rolling over. "
"4361620","4364240"," See how the daily is rolling over right here?"
"4364760","4365820"," I want you to see this right here."
"4365980","4367060"," Can't wait to watch this right here."
"4368520","4370340"," I'm going to look at something over here, okay?"
"4375120","4376980"," See how you have the yellow line?"
"4377140","4379860"," The daily is just heading higher and higher and higher. "
"4380900","4383640"," Daily flattens out, then you get your blood."
"4384840","4386700"," Daily trigger is still heading higher right now, right?"
"4388040","4390160"," Daily trigger not flattening out right now."
"4390360","4395300"," Expectation would be pulled back down and test that daily trigger and just start bouncing and going"
"4395300","4395620"," higher. "
"4396380","4400840"," If we come down here and you start to see that daily trigger flatten out, I'll go with you as"
"4400840","4401460"," a bear."
"4402260","4403620"," Do you see price come down?"
"4408280","4408300"," Right?"
"4411050","4415670"," If you see the daily trigger come up and start flattening out, you start to see price get"
"4415670","4416750"," underneath that daily trigger."
"4417110","4422910"," We'll discuss at that point, you and your bloodbath and all the doom and gloom that's coming into"
"4422910","4424370"," February and January, all that stuff. "
"4424970","4428110"," Now, do I think that we're going to roll over in February and January?"
"4428530","4432690"," I do, but this time frame right here is not right now."
"4432810","4435610"," This is like February, April, all that kind of stuff."
"4436270","4437330"," Way farther down the road. "
"4437630","4441270"," Intraday stuff, the expectation here would be that we trade sideways."
"4442510","4443410"," This gets picked up."
"4443850","4445610"," End of December comes into play. "
"4446090","4447370"," Tag that upside move."
"4447890","4449830"," Tag that previous high, that kind of stuff."
"4451070","4455450"," Now, I'm going to show something else here that kind of backs this up. "
"4456110","4461730"," Now, if velocity was at plus 25 or plus 50, I'd be like, fuck that."
"4461850","4462490"," Sell the market."
"4463810","4464450"," It's not. "
"4464730","4465650"," It's not at plus 25."
"4465990","4466930"," It's not at plus 50."
"4467090","4467830"," That's daily value. "
"4469130","4470430"," So is it sell the market here?"
"4470470","4471050"," Probably not."
"4474310","4475770"," Highly likely that it's not."
"4475950","4477410"," We're going to go to the MBI next, though. "
"4477490","4478830"," We're going to take a look at the MBI really quick."
"4481130","4484250"," We're going to chat about this and it's important."
"4487580","4494050"," So what I want to show you here, I want to show you something here. "
"4494130","4494770"," It's very important."
"4496230","4497290"," And why it matters."
"4500900","4501880"," I end of stuff, okay. "
"4505930","4507470"," PMOs not topped out yet."
"4509150","4511370"," A PPO not topped out yet."
"4512150","4513350"," And here's the scary one. "
"4513550","4513770"," You ready?"
"4516030","4518190"," The scary one is this one right here."
"4518970","4521710"," I want you to see that one right there."
"4522170","4528890"," So if you're a seller, you're a bear, I want you to look at this area right here in the"
"4528890","4529490"," market, okay. "
"4531670","4535010"," And I want you to see where we are right here, too."
"4535010","4543320"," So if you begin to see some kind of grinding action over here, do you see market breath come down?"
"4544960","4545920"," See it right there."
"4548320","4550820"," See how price didn't follow that action?"
"4552580","4557160"," We rotate it into another index in the market. "
"4557720","4559260"," Price didn't drop on spoos."
"4559400","4562160"," We rotated out of spoos and rotated back in one more time."
"4562160","4562600"," What happened?"
"4563600","4564440"," Rip face up, right?"
"4565320","4565720"," Just blinding. "
"4566500","4569460"," So we do this stupid grind over here and then boom."
"4571360","4572740"," What happens over here?"
"4573340","4574040"," And you're fucked."
"4574280","4574980"," Does that make sense?"
"4576420","4583540"," And what ends up happening here is you end up getting like this ramp over here. "
"4584860","4589600"," And then boom, we get that one little tag right there."
"4590260","4590860"," Does that make sense?"
"4591980","4595420"," So as a bear right now, as a seller right now, right?"
"4597460","4603700"," Hey, I want you to know that the PMOs and the PPOs are saying, yeah, we're a little toppy right"
"4603700","4607840"," now in spoos, but we're likely going to, there's a high chance we're going to do some rotating."
"4608280","4609400"," You saw yesterday, right?"
"4609500","4611180"," You saw some tickers just going to the moon. "
"4611620","4613640"," You saw Microsoft going to the moon."
"4613660","4616340"," You saw a bunch of other tickers just being ripped and ripped and ripped."
"4618180","4620500"," Where the market was just kind of stalled out, right?"
"4620840","4625540"," If the market stalls out in here, and you don't see that move that downside move, you don't see us"
"4625540","4628420"," get lower than 440, 434, 430. "
"4629040","4631340"," Be scared of that if you're a bear, okay?"
"4633020","4634580"," Here's that 430 right here."
"4635180","4636500"," Here's that 430 right there."
"4636640","4640960"," So if you see that like bullshit grinding and this kind of stuff, and you're like, it's going to"
"4640960","4641760"," crash down here. "
"4641960","4642300"," It's not."
"4642440","4644940"," It's going to squeeze up into the end of the year."
"4645140","4647420"," So be very patient or careful about this. "
"4647420","4653540"," If PMOs were already up here, I might be afraid of, yeah, that we get the role there."
"4653740","4654540"," We get the role up here."
"4655180","4658760"," We're kind of fucked, but I'm not as scared right now. "
"4659480","4665680"," MBI says sell spoons here, but you already know that we can grind this up higher."
"4665680","4667060"," We can trade this thing sideways."
"4667100","4668220"," We can roll it down. "
"4668680","4675780"," Just be careful of the, I guess the point of this show specifically is the point of the show"
"4675780","4677720"," specifically is be very careful."
"4679140","4688020"," Be very careful on your bearish expectations into"
"4688020","4693820"," next week because it's end of year, because the CTA's are buying."
"4694680","4695900"," I know the VIX is already low. "
"4696080","4697140"," It should go up right."
"4697560","4701780"," VIX should go up price if it doesn't follow though is going to be important, right?"
"4701960","4706640"," So if you're a seller here, I think it's fine for you to sell into next week."
"4707040","4715240"," I'm likely going to take some puts into next week, but I would be, if I was a seller, I'd"
"4715240","4725100"," be suspicious and I would be wondering if price will end up like this price follow or not. "
"4725600","4731740"," And if you don't see price follow in the next week and some major downside moves, be wary of that"
"4731740","4732640"," happening."
"4732920","4738300"," If you're not seeing like good moves down like break 440 like it's nothing, break 434, break 434,"
"4738520","4740540"," 430 and just start hammering to the downside."
"4741380","4743340"," I'd be really wary of that as a seller. "
"4744040","4749420"," I was the only caveat to we're at the top and MBI says we're at the top."
"4750180","4759500"," PMOs, PPOs do not say that and then daily velocity and hourly velocity does not say that either."
"4759800","4764620"," So I'd be very, very conscious of it in the coming days. "
"4765160","4765720"," One second here."
"4768520","4770680"," Well, we got to talk about that too."
"4770720","4780680"," Not today, but we have to talk about Jerome is so you guys all know that you guys"
"4780680","4790750"," all understand that the primary vehicle for the primary"
"4790750","4793870"," vehicle for was a couple things to talk about this here. "
"4794330","4795550"," We're not there yet."
"4797770","4799310"," Should we look at 10-year really quick?"
"4799430","4800230"," Let's look 10-year really quick."
"4800470","4801010"," Let's look 10-year. "
"4804860","4807320"," Someone just said something about cutting."
"4811660","4815780"," So the, let's go to that screen really quick, trigger screen."
"4815780","4817760"," This is the 10-year yield. "
"4823340","4825400"," You guys remember this whole thing right here, right?"
"4825680","4827940"," BAM came up here, immediately sold off and down."
"4828940","4833180"," Now the 10-year yield is saying is good for bears, okay?"
"4833560","4834860"," Now we got to talk about this."
"4835040","4836180"," It's an important thing to talk about. "
"4836300","4838040"," We'll talk about more in depth on the road."
"4838400","4841740"," So the market can go up and down without the yields being important."
"4842060","4846300"," The individual, if the curve in uninverts, stuff like that, market can actually go up. "
"4846960","4850220"," Now it is fascinating right now."
"4850640","4860440"," If you're a bull, it's fascinating right now to watch the 10-year yield because"
"4860440","4870760"," if the 10-year yield begins to reject in a bigger way to the downside, it"
"4870760","4873520"," gets underneath the weekly trigger and this daily trigger is coming down."
"4874560","4882900"," So if we start to see something like this, right, it, what do you think, maybe ask you at home,"
"4882940","4884140"," what do you think that that means?"
"4885240","4889300"," Because to me, that means more rate cuts down the road. "
"4892020","4898200"," So there's a lot of caveats to this, but there's a lot of caveats to this."
"4899980","4906440"," The idea here would be that the main vehicle for Fed policy today is yields."
"4907660","4913600"," And if they don't have yields to enforce that economic policy, they have to then unload somewhere"
"4913600","4913980"," else. "
"4914280","4919440"," And what they'll end up doing is raising rates even higher if they can't get it out of yields."
"4919900","4922780"," So you either got the only have a couple choices here."
"4922780","4926800"," It's either going to be in yields or it's going to be in the form of rate hikes, right?"
"4927860","4936020"," So I am fascinated right now how this bodes, how yields bode for rate hikes. "
"4936960","4948660"," If you end up getting yields falling off a cliff, if"
"4948660","4956740"," you end up getting yields falling off a cliff, right, the Fed will be forced, likely forced to"
"4956740","4957740"," raise rates."
"4958180","4965560"," So we'll keep a close eye on it as we'll keep a close eye on it as keep a close"
"4965560","4971140"," eye on the yields as the months continue on."
"4971540","4972500"," Do they hold?"
"4972960","4977680"," Do they raise us 25 or 50 BPS or way higher?"
"4981260","4983100"," They're in a box, man. "
"4983420","4990220"," They're not in a box, but we got a lot to talk about with yields."
"4990300","4994460"," We got a lot to talk about with the Fed's plan, that kind of stuff."
"4994820","5002140"," And we have to do a big show on expectations for the low in the market and that kind of"
"5002140","5003100"," stuff in the springtime. "
"5005100","5006680"," How low does it go, that kind of stuff."
"5007120","5015920"," And the vehicles that the Fed is going to use for removing the sloshing money around in the"
"5015920","5016200"," marketplace."
"5017880","5022540"," We got so much to talk about because the stock market is cheap as fuck right now. "
"5022660","5024740"," I know you guys don't think that it is, but it's dirt cheap."
"5026620","5029420"," And it's implied that it's going to be dirt cheap."
"5030840","5034400"," It's implied that it's going to be dirt cheap in five years. "
"5035980","5037180"," It really is."
"5037180","5046280"," You guys are both, I know and you know that wages are going up."
"5046600","5049820"," We both know that cost of living isn't coming down. "
"5051020","5057940"," And if that's the case, then no matter what they say, whatever the Fed says, that the market is"
"5057940","5058200"," cheaper."
"5059520","5060720"," The dollar is worth less."
"5062280","5065220"," And that means that the price of the stock market is cheap. "
"5065220","5069020"," So my boy back there, Tom Lee is probably right."
"5069960","5071360"," We got a lot to talk about that."
"5071520","5077360"," There's there's likely if you, I don't know how old you are, but man, when you get older, you see"
"5077360","5084180"," it like they're setting this up so that if you're young, when you're 40 or 50, you're like, we're"
"5084180","5090420"," starting a new cycle right now of welcome to higher prices and welcome to higher wages. "
"5091100","5097180"," So it'll probably take five, 10, 20 years to to come around that curve."
"5097600","5100980"," But I think the Fed loses this, loses this fight."
"5101300","5102060"," I'll be honest with you. "
"5102140","5103580"," I think the Fed loses this fight."
"5103740","5104780"," I don't think they win this fight."
"5109660","5111020"," It's kind of crazy to say. "
"5111940","5116360"," I think that they know that they lost this fight and I think that it's a matter of adjustments over"
"5116360","5119220"," time for them to, for you and everybody to accept it all."
"5120980","5125360"," That we're just going to live in that environment where the dollar is fucking worthless."
"5126920","5129640"," Now we have to talk about what that means too, if that's going to be the case. "
"5130040","5131840"," If that is the case, we're going to run into a new cycle."
"5132100","5132760"," How bad is it get?"
"5134300","5136960"," Do we go back down and touch that that trough again?"
"5137920","5141120"," Or do we get the all-time highs then go back and check, recheck the all-time high or not"
"5141120","5141820"," into next year."
"5142020","5143540"," So we'll talk about that soon. "
"5144420","5147520"," So coming week or so, make it through your conversation, put down the road."
"5152220","5155500"," We got a double bear plane on spy right now."
"5158620","5160640"," The bod is short right now too. "
"5163920","5165040"," That's bearish cap."
"5165360","5166320"," No, it's not."
"5167040","5170280"," Well, it isn't depending on how you look at it. "
"5170760","5172700"," Depends on how you look at things."
"5176340","5180800"," So a higher rate bearish depends on the time frame you're looking at."
"5181360","5187520"," If there's still raising rates, we won't have that trough check until they're done raising rates. "
"5187700","5191180"," The key point here is this is that, I guess the key point to take away from this is this."
"5191820","5196440"," If they're not done raising rates because they can't unload in the fucking in the bond market,"
"5196440","5201080"," right, and they're going to continue to raise rates, you're not going to see that recheck yet."
"5201520","5202280"," You're going to be delayed. "
"5203840","5205560"," That's not bearish for the stock market."
"5206120","5210160"," You want to get bearish once we've hit the terminal rate."
"5211160","5216260"," If you're a bear, you want to get bearish the moment we've hit terminal rate for that check,"
"5216480","5217240"," wherever the price is. "
"5217280","5222900"," If price is above the previous high, previous all-time high of 2022 in January, you want to get"
"5222900","5224300"," bearish on a recheck of that price."
"5226280","5231480"," And if we're not above it, you're looking for that 350, that 3500 as the recheck."
"5232300","5235000"," So right now, it's not bearish. "
"5235680","5239740"," If they're going to be forced into raising rates, you're not going to see that bloodbath that"
"5239740","5240340"," you're looking for."
"5245450","5248350"," If something is broke, yeah, something's really fucking broke."
"5249110","5254270"," Does the fucked up part about this, right, is that the auction window the Fed's still showing up in"
"5254270","5255270"," their warehousing this shit. "
"5255810","5259970"," They're not even really dumping this stuff, so they dump what they can, and then they warehouse the"
"5259970","5261210"," rest of it and call it a sold."
"5262570","5265770"," It's kind of like me, how do I explain this better?"
"5267550","5271290"," It's kind of like me saying that this is some fucked up accounting by the Fed."
"5271910","5280270"," It's kind of like me going to, it's kind of like me selling 100 cars every month. "
"5280570","5281270"," I'm selling cars."
"5281510","5284710"," I'm selling 100 cars every month, and you're the buyer, right?"
"5284870","5289190"," You're buying 100 cars every month, and I have no problem selling them."
"5289250","5294030"," And then I show up one day to sell 100 cars, and only 25 cars get bought. "
"5295410","5299270"," And I go, oh shit, what am I going to do?"
"5299970","5303810"," So what I do is on paper, I say I sold those 100 cars."
"5304090","5310450"," Instead of selling the 25, I'm actually selling 25, but I tell you, I sold 100 cars."
"5311290","5315650"," Well, what I did was I took 75 of those vehicles, and I park them. "
"5317290","5320950"," And I'm telling you that I sold them on paper, it says that I sold them because I'm the Fed."
"5321450","5323770"," And seriously, I'm the fucking Fed, I'm the Treasury Department."
"5324430","5326890"," And I'm telling you that I'm telling them the Fed. "
"5326890","5330190"," I'm the Fed and the Treasury Department, and I told you that I sold them."
"5330490","5335390"," But in reality to the downside, I'm just putting those 75 cars to the side."
"5336030","5340630"," And what I'm going to do is I'm going to unload them in five or 10 years or 20 years"
"5340630","5341810"," slowly. "
"5342630","5345630"," I'll sell like two or three, two or three, two or three, two or three."
"5345870","5347010"," At least that's what I'm telling you."
"5347650","5348250"," Does that make sense?"
"5349970","5354910"," Now, I don't know if those cars are going to fucking implode or get old, or the seals are going"
"5354910","5359150"," to go bad, or the whole thing is going to blow up my face. "
"5359750","5360970"," This is the Fed, mind you."
"5361030","5362390"," This is the Treasury Department, right?"
"5363770","5369470"," Whatever they tell us, as long as we believe, they can carry that fraud forward."
"5370570","5373110"," Now, this was the Fed talked about this last summer. "
"5373550","5381590"," As a matter of fact, one of my heroes out there, the Jedi Marcus posted a link to this information"
"5381590","5383150"," last year from the Fed."
"5383690","5386150"," They quietly released it saying this is what they were doing."
"5386270","5387250"," They fucking told us. "
"5387690","5388930"," And nobody paid attention to it."
"5388930","5389410"," He made that post."
"5389610","5390430"," I reposted it. "
"5390810","5395050"," We think that post got like 10 fucking comments and five likes from Jedi Marcus."
"5395950","5396910"," And no one cared."
"5397230","5398430"," And I'm like, no one reads this shit. "
"5398590","5400770"," No one reads the fine print of what they're actually doing."
"5401270","5402430"," And that's what they're fucking doing."
"5402550","5404570"," That's the simplest way that I can explain it. "
"5409300","5410320"," Well, they do."
"5410700","5412380"," It's a bad relation."
"5412800","5413280"," It's a bad. "
"5413820","5418820"," It's a bad silhouette of saying cars, because when you think cars are going to go bad, right?"
"5419480","5420840"," This stuff doesn't go bad."
"5420880","5421820"," It just sits there, right?"
"5421980","5423360"," Until they can dump it down."
"5423480","5424880"," Basically, you know what it is?"
"5425620","5427100"," We're shitting on our kids. "
"5428040","5432460"," I'm shitting on my, like we're shitting on my children, my grandkids, and the buck is getting"
"5432460","5432920"," passed."
"5433860","5437660"," That's a better way to, a car is a bad, it's not bad."
"5437660","5440700"," It's just in your mind, you're probably saying, well, you might not be able to sell those cars. "
"5440700","5441420"," They're going to be looking old."
"5442620","5445620"," But they're going to dress it up like a pig with lipstick on it and sell it."
"5445840","5446380"," Does it make sense?"
"5447140","5449680"," And they're going to, you're going to pay for it in time. "
"5449980","5453620"," So we'll have a second here."
"5456600","5457000"," All right."
"5457080","5458360"," We got a lot to go over here. "
"5460340","5461840"," These motherfucking calls are burning."
"5462100","5464960"," Well, they're a little bit less than 50%."
"5466040","5467060"," I'm holding them though. "
"5467160","5468920"," I know they got to squeeze this shit up into the belt."
"5468920","5470980"," So I'm not fucking selling for any..."
"5470980","5471400"," Hold on a second."
"5480470","5480930"," All right. "
"5480950","5482030"," I'm DCAing right now."
"5485950","5487230"," I'm telling you, that's what's happening."
"5487630","5491330"," I'm telling you, you're going to come back every year, three years. "
"5491630","5493430"," You guys come back and you're like, he was saying it was real."
"5494190","5496790"," Everything I say to you guys, I know you read about it either."
"5497070","5499570"," If I tell you something, it happens in a week. "
"5500370","5502010"," If I'm like, hey, this is going to happen next week."
"5502490","5504390"," I tell you, hey, in six months, this is going to happen."
"5504570","5506250"," I tell you next year, this is going to happen normally. "
"5506250","5507750"," That shit comes true."
"5508290","5508910"," Fucking Tesla."
"5509610","5510470"," What did I tell you?"
"5510810","5515930"," I made fucking videos with Tesla was going to release the cyber truck end of year, right?"
"5516610","5518610"," How many days until they released that goddamn truck?"
"5519350","5522890"," I told you they'd have delivery problems, right?"
"5523450","5525550"," That shit's going to happen coming up here, right?"
"5525670","5528310"," You're going to find out there's going to be delivery failures. "
"5528810","5530130"," I told you at the end of the year and that stuff."
"5530270","5532790"," Any time I tell you this stuff, you guys always come back and say he was right."
"5532790","5540210"," So five, 10 years, you're going to come back and you're going to be like, what the fuck?"
"5540350","5544010"," It's sad because do I think we go hyperinflation like Japan?"
"5544770","5546250"," I hope that we don't. "
"5546710","5552150"," I think we have so few, I want you guys to understand too with Japan."
"5553370","5557770"," They were pulling that shit from the 70s into the 90s."
"5558310","5561390"," That was like a function of the 1970s into the 90s. "
"5561390","5565230"," There's a bunch of other mechanics to it with hedge funds, American hedge funds and stuff like"
"5565230","5575970"," that, but the question becomes, so you got like Japan's like pound in the bottle, right?"
"5577610","5581010"," Let's make an apartment cost $35,000 a month, right?"
"5581410","5582330"," Woo, pound in it."
"5582850","5585510"," In the US is like, I got the same bottle."
"5587750","5590010"," And do I just slam it?"
"5591390","5592630"," Or do I just sip it?"
"5593470","5596370"," Do I pound it during COVID and then spit it back in the bottle?"
"5597130","5598350"," But I still want to drink it. "
"5599170","5601590"," The point that I'm trying to make to here is this."
"5604170","5605630"," Is it the same as Japan?"
"5606150","5609490"," Fuck no, but is it Japan on a longer time frame?"
"5610230","5611450"," That dang right it is."
"5612210","5613150"," It is Japan. "
"5614590","5622790"," So whereas Japan is trying to or did something on a a higher time frame, the US is like, yeah,"
"5622970","5627530"," you know what, instead of turning it into two or three decades, we could probably get six decades"
"5627530","5628110"," out of this."
"5628790","5629630"," Does that make sense?"
"5630070","5633910"," So you got like the, you got, you know that you got, I'm not saying the name because I've done"
"5633910","5637870"," cocaine out there, but I'm sure everybody knows the the coke monster, right?"
"5638610","5642150"," If you remember, even if you don't do it, there's always a coke monster."
"5642330","5646190"," You go to a party somewhere and there's that one like slightly overweight guy. "
"5646190","5647530"," He's the life of the party."
"5647750","5649650"," He's jackets hanging off and we sweat in bullets."
"5650210","5652810"," And he's the guy that wants to do everybody's cocaine, right?"
"5653070","5654870"," You're like, don't tell that guy that we've got drugs. "
"5655430","5659370"," That guy's going to do them all in one sitting where we will be dead, but in 15 minutes of"
"5659370","5659730"," an overdose."
"5660530","5661830"," That guy's going to smoke all the weed."
"5661850","5665270"," That guy's going to drink all the all the papi, the Rip Van Winkle, right?"
"5665410","5667330"," You don't break the Rip Van Winkle out with that guy. "
"5667630","5669770"," He's got like, you know, he's got like a polo shirt."
"5670510","5671870"," It's like unbuttoned slightly."
"5672450","5673730"," It's like sweat coming through. "
"5673730","5674430"," He's at a party."
"5674610","5677270"," It's probably got curly hair, slightly receding hairline."
"5677790","5679850"," He's got a bandana going across his head. "
"5681470","5684070"," He's got a tweed sport coat on with shoulder pads."
"5684630","5687910"," And he's just like in the party and you're like, don't tell that guy over there we got."
"5693130","5696590"," It's always like a, you go to a party, it's always like a drug, you know, the drug monster is"
"5696590","5696990"," always there. "
"5697090","5698410"," You're like, stay away from that guy over there."
"5698470","5698830"," That guy's crazy."
"5700470","5703210"," Like if the pain was that guy, you know?"
"5703210","5706630"," And then the other guy's got marijuana or Rip Van Winkle. "
"5707210","5711010"," And the guy with the coke monster's got his bottle of Rip Van, that bottle of Rip Van Winkle will"
"5711010","5711370"," be dead."
"5712050","5712770"," Same party."
"5713330","5717370"," You use like giving a few shots to your friends and I'll see you next week, bros. "
"5717710","5718750"," That's what the US is doing."
"5721370","5728940"," Okay, so we went over that all that shit, right?"
"5729080","5731320"," So we've been through all that stuff, caught you up on all that stuff."
"5731820","5735220"," We do have to have a conversation at some point about where the fed is headed. "
"5735860","5741080"," Um, down the road, we already know what the fed says they're going to do."
"5741640","5746400"," What their plan is here, yields are saying they're going to have to raise rates."
"5746780","5750400"," I would expect, I'm going to let you know where yields are right now. "
"5751000","5755100"," You're going to expect raises, more raises from the fed because of it."
"5756180","5763880"," Now, if you are going to get more raises, the idea here would be that we're not at the end"
"5763880","5770760"," of the hiking cycle and they're likely wrong in how many more hikes we have out of us."
"5771740","5776560"," That could extend this sideways and up market for another year. "
"5778260","5779880"," Um, it really does."
"5780060","5780640"," It really does."
"5780740","5783920"," It could drag this out for multiple years. "
"5784940","5794720"," So if you're a bear, you're looking for the end of rate cycle hikes uh, for that role that you're"
"5794720","5795280"," looking for."
"5795520","5800840"," And right now it doesn't look like, looks like the, it looks like the yields are going to force the"
"5800840","5803420"," fed into a longer hiking cycle."
"5804860","5805640"," Not good. "
"5808980","5811220"," Not, not, not good for for sellers."
"5811560","5812960"," Not good for bulls either."
"5816720","5818140"," Yeah, love the patch elbows. "
"5822900","5828360"," I should get on a picture, you know what, you know, it's like, um, it's like, uh, fucking, I don't"
"5828360","5829160"," know animal house."
"5829380","5834800"," It's like, uh, Jim Belushi, uh, it's pretty, pretty much what you're looking for."
"5834920","5835440"," It's like, it's fine. "
"5835680","5837200"," Jim Belushi, like, stay with that fucking guy over there."
"5837420","5838920"," We got a lot of trouble with that guy over there."
"5843820","5847720"," Oh, dude, this is killing me. "
"5847840","5852920"," Look at this fucking, like, fucking Friday staring the boat, staring the fucking shitty bust into"
"5852920","5854120"," the fucking terminal in the clothes."
"5855420","5857240"," Okay, so we're going to have a couple of other stuff."
"5857460","5858020"," We're going to talk about Tesla. "
"5858560","5861000"," Uh, we're going to talk Tesla."
"5862800","5863680"," So Tesla."
"5867000","5868840"," We're going to do Tesla talk really quick. "
"5869860","5870240"," Tesla."
"5872480","5876300"," Talk about Tesla on, um, this morning."
"5878760","5881240"," Now, I love trading Tesla. "
"5885380","5887560"," Now, I know the VIX is low and I get it."
"5887660","5888820"," I go, we'll go hit the VIX next."
"5889080","5893500"," We'll do the, I should have done the VIX first, but we're going to talk about Tesla. "
"5895940","5901160"," And what I want to talk to you about is buying these gorgeous fucking daily bottoms, man."
"5901460","5902420"," It's just so easy."
"5902540","5903860"," Like Tesla is like the easiest thing. "
"5904440","5910640"," The scary part here, though, is that we're not even up yet on daily yet on Tesla."
"5911000","5917080"," So I want to be, I want to be careful with you here to say Tesla likely has another push"
"5917080","5917500"," higher."
"5918420","5919200"," Here, okay. "
"5919880","5925680"," Even if it rolls down here, it likely has an upward thrust still inside of it to get up here."
"5926620","5927020"," Okay."
"5927240","5932220"," So in Tesla, if you're a Tesla bull, if you're a Tesla bull in any year, you're likely going to"
"5932220","5936160"," get your stock unfilled again, maybe even in early January. "
"5936160","5940940"," But I would expect this, this continuation for Tesla to the upside over here."
"5941400","5942700"," Be very careful here."
"5942820","5947980"," If you're a, if you're a Tesla bear, uh, be very, I guess if you're a Tesla bear, you're like,"
"5948140","5950180"," yeah, sell, sell, sell. "
"5951300","5951500"," Sorry, cap."
"5951720","5951960"," You're wrong."
"5952100","5952620"," We're going downtown. "
"5953960","5958820"," I get that, I get that auto, but I want you to know that there's a, there's a trap down"
"5958820","5959460"," here for bears."
"5960580","5965640"," Uh, and that trap lies in, uh, in this, in this velocity down here."
"5966800","5968740"," This velocity coming up to the upside. "
"5970040","5972020"," In like a fry and pan across the head."
"5972680","5974560"," You just watch this shit explode to the upside."
"5976000","5980060"," So Tesla, and I want the reason, the other reason I'm telling you this is because of the turn in"
"5980060","5986760"," the daily trigger down here is big and the weekly velocity is very emotional here, right?"
"5986960","5988680"," The weekly trigger is very emotional. "
"5989320","5990680"," We're right now above the monthly trigger."
"5990920","5991400"," That's all bullish."
"5992660","5997700"," Uh, so if you're a Tesla bull, uh, you are looking to buy one, buy one of these dips down. "
"5997760","6004380"," As a matter of fact, you probably had your, probably had your, your, your chance to buy that dip"
"6004380","6005420"," right here."
"6006380","6008700"," See that nice, beautiful red brick wick right there."
"6009320","6011640"," That demand step right in right here. "
"6012860","6016840"," Those all go step right in like it was nobody's business to continue to the upside."
"6017940","6022080"," Uh, so if you get a chance to buy Tesla, uh, you already had your first chance this morning."
"6022600","6024320"," It was at a two twenty six, seventeen. "
"6024940","6031820"," If you are looking for a, a deeper low, maybe two, twelve, but I don't buy it."
"6031820","6032040"," Okay."
"6033020","6035120"," Uh, if you're looking to long Tesla. "
"6035420","6041260"," Or to take that next trip higher, you are looking for anything, any kind of back check that's"
"6041260","6044660"," successful on two thirty four."
"6045140","6050380"," Any kind of squeezing that back checks, uh, matter of fact, I'll give you a target here."
"6052320","6054380"," You got, matter of fact, you're just the first one. "
"6055380","6057240"," You just took this one out right here."
"6057960","6059860"," So your next one is going to be up here."
"6060480","6062660"," So now you're looking for another trade up here. "
"6064220","6069140"," And then you'll get the next trade up there and then you're going to get the next trade up there."
"6070700","6075000"," So Tesla, I am bullish, uh, very bullish on Tesla."
"6076220","6079460"," Remember I was, remember I was bullish on, on, uh, meta. "
"6079720","6080920"," Remember you guys were like, fuck meta."
"6081080","6082200"," You guys weren't really a couple weeks ago."
"6082200","6084520"," We're talking about meta and I was like, I'm very, very bullish on meta. "
"6084940","6086000"," Where's meta right now?"
"6086000","6086660"," Pretty high, right?"
"6087480","6090240"," A few tickers that I said, I'm pretty bullish on pretty fucking high right now."
"6090280","6090900"," So there you go."
"6090900","6094780"," Oh, that one, this one right here, Tesla, very bullish on IWM. "
"6095620","6097520"," I wanted to make a post in IWM last week."
"6098300","6100660"," Oh no, two days ago or three days ago or something like that."
"6101400","6104820"," And what I wanted to talk about was, uh, this right here. "
"6105980","6109520"," Uh, that there was going to be an attack on the weekly trigger."
"6111300","6111740"," Okay."
"6112340","6114320"," Uh, now IWM is still bearish. "
"6114420","6117200"," We have a bunch of reports coming out that impact that IWM."
"6117820","6119540"," And the daily trigger that was turned up here."
"6120900","6124440"," Uh, we're in, we also have a big turn on the daily velocity. "
"6125000","6127740"," I want you to see this down here."
"6128040","6130140"," Big turn on daily velocity heading higher now."
"6132220","6134200"," And through some consolidation. "
"6136360","6137600"," I'll chart this out for you."
"6141020","6143060"," I'm actually bullish in the next week."
"6148380","6152700"," I'm going to be bullish on, uh, IWM into next week. "
"6152880","6156360"," So all this down here, you see this stuff coming up right here."
"6156840","6161940"," One day weekend comes up, maybe you get one more dip eye down here."
"6162680","6164940"," Let's let's, uh, let's do it like this. "
"6168790","6172590"," Let's do something like that right there."
"6173410","6174830"," Turn that green."
"6176650","6184130"," Hey, chances you get to buy, if you get any chance to buy, um, small, small craps next week by"
"6184130","6189210"," the fuck of it, 171, 170, something like that. "
"6189650","6192070"," Uh, but target right now, currently target right now."
"6192470","6194630"," And we are above the hourly trigger right now."
"6194710","6195690"," The daily trigger is coming up. "
"6195890","6200630"," And I'll tell you what, you get that cross up there and it's going to fucking rip."
"6202110","6205030"," It's getting good to get some target, some good targets up here."
"6211410","6214070"," Grinding, grinding, grinding right there. "
"6226230","6227570"," Come back down right there."
"6236260","6236940"," Hey, buddy."
"6237460","6237980"," How you doing?"
"6238260","6240920"," We're in right there. "
"6244400","6247820"," So there's IWM for, uh, it's some of more over there."
"6249680","6251500"," So there you go for IWM."
"6252100","6257780"," Uh, the real price target on IWM is right there. "
"6259180","6269140"," 190 flat end of the"
"6269140","6269400"," year."
"6270160","6275750"," Uh, that's somewhere around the 30th, something like that."
"6275990","6276630"," Just call that, oop. "
"6281340","6282580"," Trash over there."
"6282800","6285120"," We'll do a vertical line over here."
"6285300","6288120"," That's end of year right there. "
"6288120","6290020"," And I think you actually get that squeeze up."
"6290700","6292020"," I think you actually get that."
"6292660","6293820"," I might get that now. "
"6305090","6305950"," Something like that."
"6306090","6308910"," So IWM, very bullish, NVDA."
"6314050","6315990"," And we'll talk about VIX here at some point too. "
"6317270","6320750"," NVDA, they are coming into their earnings on the 21st."
"6321050","6322230"," Let me see if I can bring something up here."
"6328570","6332170"," I'm going to read something to you about and video here in just a moment. "
"6333830","6335970"," We're going to talk NVDA here in just a moment here."
"6336050","6337530"," I got something else I want to tell you here."
"6344640","6348640"," Okay, so Piper Sandler raises the NVIDIA's data center rev estimates. "
"6348980","6352640"," Piper Sandler is optimistic that NVIDIA can deliver strong quarterly results next week."
"6353360","6355120"," Thanks to strong revs from a key segment."
"6355460","6357860"," Firm raised at sales estimates for the chip makers data centers. "
"6358300","6363560"," Business for the third October and January quarters 13 billion and 14.34 billion respectively."
"6364340","6368420"," Quote, we believe demand from US cloud and other data center."
"6369700","6373180"," Clients remain strong and intact given these firms are still. "
"6374260","6379860"," In the process of transforming their data centers with accelerated compute capabilities."
"6380560","6382980"," End quote analyst harsh Kumar wrote quote."
"6382980","6387340"," We note that these include all of the key players in the cloud industry as well as GPU, AS"
"6387340","6390460"," startups, which are also providing tailwinds to demand. "
"6390460","6394220"," End quote NVIDIA is set to report earnings Tuesday."
"6394220","6403080"," Maher has an over rate rating of the stock and a price target of $620 implying an upside of 25%."
"6405240","6411240"," Upside of 25% price target of $620. "
"6412640","6416960"," Boy, if Joe Donut is out there right now."
"6418790","6420030"," I hope he's here."
"6420030","6424830"," He's listening right now because we talked about this in December. "
"6425790","6427350"," December or March or something."
"6428210","6430170"," Fixed 20 baby way up here."
"6431030","6433050"," This is Piper Sandler's expectation. "
"6434090","6436770"," Do I think that's today or tomorrow or next week or are there earnings?"
"6437090","6437510"," I doubt it."
"6439510","6441930"," We'll just do PS for Piper Sandler."
"6444070","6446090"," PS claiming we're going all the way up here. "
"6446770","6447810"," Pretty big move, right?"
"6450510","6452650"," Do I think that's like end of year?"
"6453050","6453490"," Probably not."
"6453690","6454030"," It's possible."
"6454710","6455730"," Probably not. "
"6456390","6463910"," Now NVIDIA is expecting a 6.8% move into their ER."
"6464870","6465510"," Oh, yeah."
"6465910","6466450"," Spoons, baby. "
"6467410","6469590"," Oh, yeah."
"6471250","6472690"," Oh, spoons."
"6473710","6474030"," Give me that. "
"6474290","6475130"," Give me that money."
"6476380","6477970"," Give me that money, baby."
"6479230","6480070"," Look, yeah. "
"6480950","6482010"," Oh, yeah."
"6482310","6483570"," Did I just add it at $0.20?"
"6484050","6490890"," I had a, I had $0.43 and $0.20. So I'm green right now."
"6491250","6491790"," Okay, okay. "
"6492150","6494990"," So it's the NVIDIA."
"6497010","6506240"," They have an expected move of 6.8%. That's 7%."
"6507040","6511060"," It's 6.8% for November 24th. "
"6513080","6520180"," They're expiring on November 24th right here."
"6522700","6529460"," So there's an expectation here of an upside move right there."
"6540860","6543880"," We would expect that it's 6.8% downside move. "
"6544740","6553860"," And that's just down to $0.20. Let's get rid of that now."
"6555880","6558540"," There's a downside expectation down here."
"6569260","6572500"," Now let's take a look at velocity in NVIDIA. "
"6573460","6574760"," And let's take a look at it."
"6574880","6576620"," So right down here, this velocity down here."
"6577840","6581600"," You can see previous examples of it hitting $25.50, right?"
"6581880","6582560"," No problemo. "
"6583760","6585940"," Velocity is only at $15 right now."
"6586060","6588080"," So expectation is that it's going to go up more."
"6589680","6592060"," So I'm bullish into their earnings. "
"6593580","6595620"," I'm very bullish into..."
"6598460","6602360"," I'm actually very bullish into NVIDIA's earnings."
"6603160","6608780"," So today, what are we going to expect into Tuesday?"
"6611040","6612740"," I'm going to expect you're ready for it."
"6613000","6613600"," Whoop, right up there. "
"6615020","6616040"," Tag this previous high."
"6617200","6619020"," Come back down into Tuesday."
"6630290","6631610"," Target that right there. "
"6643730","6646150"," So I am bullish into their ER."
"6646510","6647130"," Just a heads up."
"6649630","6652070"," The am bullish here on NVIDIA. "
"6657490","6658850"," Actually, I think they go higher."
"6659350","6662450"," I'm going to find out where I think that goes."
"6662970","6663630"," Hold on a second here. "
"6668760","6669700"," Whoopsie daisy."
"6670740","6671560"," Holy shit."
"6681270","6682910"," We're going to see what happens right there. "
"6683310","6683810"," Oh, yeah."
"6684070","6684370"," Fuck yeah."
"6684510","6685490"," So right here. "
"6686010","6687350"," Squeeze up, get the new high."
"6688530","6698270"," Price target, $5.65. And then price target, $5.25, possibly $5.30. Into their"
"6698270","6698570"," earnings."
"6699490","6702010"," So that's what I got there for NVIDIA. "
"6702610","6702890"," Bullish."
"6704890","6707150"," I'm bullish on NVIDIA."
"6708470","6708750"," Bam, bam. "
"6709710","6713290"," Do I think your NVIDIA is going up here to Piper Sandler?"
"6714230","6715030"," On Tuesday?"
"6715450","6717190"," Get the fuck on out of here."
"6717930","6718310"," No."
"6719490","6720690"," You got a lot of work here. "
"6721630","6723290"," I think this is going to be an end of the year."
"6723490","6724090"," Take the money and run."
"6724290","6725070"," Get to Christmas bonus. "
"6726830","6728090"," Come back down in the spring."
"6729590","6731930"," And then you'll see your $6.20 or whatever down the road."
"6733530","6735890"," Matter of fact, it just hasn't flipped yet to bullish. "
"6735890","6739810"," So, but I am bullish on this into Tuesday."
"6742370","6743470"," What else should I do?"
"6743710","6743850"," Okay."
"6743970","6747190"," Well, before I get some other stuff, I want to do one of the things here with you. "
"6747270","6748630"," We're going to talk about the VIX really quick."
"6750450","6754830"," And we're going to look at a VIX here."
"6756490","6758590"," And we're going to murder the VIX into Friday, right?"
"6758810","6759490"," Talk to you about that. "
"6761370","6766670"," And what I want to talk to you about a VIX here, the important thing about VIX here is, I"
"6766670","6773200"," want to show you is that, um, where it's all in place."
"6778840","6779360"," Is that?"
"6779540","6780240"," What shot am I on here?"
"6788160","6792420"," This is what I want to show you right here."
"6796350","6797010"," Where is it?"
"6797090","6797570"," I want to show you. "
"6797770","6799670"," I want you at home, okay?"
"6801330","6802650"," On your own time."
"6803490","6804210"," Not me."
"6805750","6808010"," But not me, but I want you to. "
"6808490","6809250"," We can do this."
"6809450","6809610"," You ready?"
"6809770","6810830"," We can actually do this."
"6810990","6811110"," Hold on. "
"6813880","6816260"," Is it a, is it a bar pattern?"
"6816680","6825970"," So I want you to pay attention to this."
"6826190","6831330"," We earlier in the broadcast, I talked to you about the VIX."
"6831590","6835550"," And I talked to you about March, right?"
"6835890","6837510"," March 23rd of this year. "
"6837510","6839790"," Where a price doesn't head lower, right?"
"6839890","6846190"," I said to you, if price just, it's just grind sideways and down, because everybody's like, hey, the"
"6846190","6848270"," VIX man, it's so low, it's going to, it's going to squeeze, right?"
"6848490","6851230"," I want you to remember this pattern over here."
"6858330","6864010"," And I want you to think about, even if even the VIX comes up, right?"
"6865230","6869190"," The market doesn't necessarily need to go down in any, any meaningful way."
"6869850","6870810"," And the VIX can go up there. "
"6870910","6871230"," You see it?"
"6873690","6875270"," So that VIX can go up."
"6875730","6880950"," So if you're like, hey, the VIX man, the VIX is a problem, right?"
"6881230","6887570"," I want you to know that the VIX can easily get sold to the depth of hell, right?"
"6887990","6891650"," Squeeze up with no price decline that you're expecting."
"6892570","6896150"," Hey, why is the VIX going up and the markets just going sideways or grinding higher?"
"6897930","6898850"," I'll tell you why. "
"6898930","6903170"," It's because we're going up to retest that previous high from summer in 4800."
"6903410","6911390"," So I want you to be a wary of anyone out there telling you that the VIX, I just take"
"6911390","6912670"," the, I'm only up a few pennies."
"6915770","6923230"," But I want you to be, I guess my point behind the VIX is whenever you're looking at, or I"
"6923230","6928990"," guess that my point to you would be, my point to you would be, this man is staring at me,"
"6928990","6936290"," my point to you would be that the VIX is low and the VIX can or should go up from"
"6936290","6943730"," here, but I would temper your expectations on the VIX being the indicator to be looking at in terms"
"6943730","6944310"," of price. "
"6944650","6950910"," If the market rotates, right, for two, three weeks, even longer into December, but there's no"
"6950910","6957950"," appreciative decline, yet you see the VIX blast off, rip higher, right, and then it rejects off"
"6957950","6962430"," that previous high and starts to come back down and you start to see spoos heading higher, you're"
"6962430","6965990"," going to be like, holding your dick in your hand, right, being like, fuck, you're like, why didn't"
"6965990","6966790"," this happen for me?"
"6967170","6970070"," So I want you to, on your own at home, I want you to go back and look at the"
"6970070","6973910"," price action in early, as late March, it was March 23rd somewhere in there."
"6974450","6979610"," And then I also want you to check out the, I also want you to be look, or check out"
"6979610","6989310"," our look for, I want you to check out our look for, uh, that price action in relation to the"
"6989310","6995310"," VIX, it being the end of the year, knowing that CTA is looking to get some window dressing, knowing"
"6995310","7001430"," that right now, the price of everything, it like, you got, you got, like, you guys have their"
"7001430","7005130"," sense, CTA's were not in this run, so like, here, I'll explain this better."
"7009550","7012070"," So, hold on, let's look at something here, okay?"
"7013670","7015730"," This is a spy right here, okay?"
"7016450","7017590"," I'm on a 30-minute chart, okay?"
"7019570","7021470"," I want to show, oh, let's go to a daily chart. "
"7023050","7025030"," So I want you to know something, okay?"
"7028160","7029860"," I want you to realize something, okay?"
"7032000","7032840"," You guys ready?"
"7036020","7037900"," CTA's were not buyers down here."
"7040160","7045720"," CTA's were not buyers, and they are now, okay?"
"7046640","7050380"," So they need to make their money, by point two, is that they need to make their money, does that"
"7050380","7050840"," make any sense?"
"7051760","7055700"," So they missed all this run over here, and they're late to the party."
"7056420","7057960"," I want to give you another example of this. "
"7058900","7060620"," They were late to the party here, too."
"7061620","7062940"," They got late to the party."
"7066650","7068610"," They got late to the party back here, too. "
"7069630","7070550"," And you know what they did?"
"7071670","7074950"," They got in in September, October, and they drove this shit up again."
"7075630","7076810"," They got in, like, right here."
"7078110","7082230"," If I remember this correctly, they got in right here, and they slammed this thing up again. "
"7083170","7090070"," So if you don't think that we can slam this up, have a little pullback, get that window dressing up"
"7090070","7090270"," there."
"7090350","7095070"," If you don't think we can get up there and do that, you could be sorely mistaken."
"7095410","7101910"," So end of the year, end of like all that end of the year shit. "
"7104490","7108570"," I'd be really, really, really careful and scared."
"7108810","7109090"," Not scared."
"7109350","7116090"," If you're a seller, I'd be like, be like, on your toes, man, if you're a seller, just the end"
"7116090","7116490"," of this year. "
"7117810","7121790"," If they're out there and they're trying to get their money, right, they didn't participate, right?"
"7122270","7124170"," Can you imagine being like some schmuck?"
"7126170","7129470"," You imagine being some schmuck and you didn't get to participate?"
"7130310","7133050"," You didn't get your participation award for October."
"7133590","7136050"," You didn't get your participation award in December."
"7136450","7139930"," Remember December of 2022, we were supposed to crash from that shit?"
"7140350","7143370"," Then we were consolidating and driving sideways, then we ripped. "
"7144170","7146390"," They didn't get to participate in that one, did they?"
"7146690","7149370"," They didn't get to participate in March, did they?"
"7149650","7152270"," So just be wary of these fuckers, right?"
"7152430","7155630"," These fuckers, man, they like have to go home with their trophy."
"7155890","7162370"," They have to go home in like, you know, it's kind of like a, it's like a fraternity."
"7165450","7170070"," Well, SPX coming into test, it's previous high right now. "
"7171250","7174590"," Do we get the previous high right now on SPX?"
"7174810","7175210"," Let's see it."
"7175390","7177510"," Or let's see if we can get that previous high up here."
"7179070","7183370"," So like, I'd relate the, I'd relate the CTA. "
"7184290","7190790"," I'd relate the CTA is like, if I had to relate this to CTA's, I would say, if you were"
"7190790","7196870"," in a fraternity or a sorority, and you know how like 70% of those guys are smart as fuck,"
"7197030","7199130"," and then 30% are regarded?"
"7202510","7205550"," Then you have to like give them the books with all the tests, and you have to like beat them"
"7205550","7208790"," up and fucking haze their asses so they do their actual work."
"7211650","7216550"," Then if you know who those people are, if you've ever been a part of anything like that, right?"
"7220090","7225370"," Then I want you to know that CTA's are like that."
"7226790","7231450"," And so like, you know, like they get the participant, like, I got my A, did you get your A?"
"7231610","7231750"," No?"
"7232130","7234910"," Okay, we got to make sure you get your A, so you can stay in the fraternity. "
"7235630","7241490"," So these guys often get their A for the gold star in the year, you know, to get their bonuses,"
"7242530","7244050"," damn it, no matter what."
"7244050","7251070"," So be really aware if you're a seller, man, you can get the VIX up and not go down to"
"7251070","7251390"," my points."
"7252070","7254830"," We can get the price to go up of the markets and grind. "
"7255790","7260430"," We can get the price, we can actually get the market to go up into that 4,800, believe it"
"7260430","7264710"," or not, and you'll actually see the VIX follow with it because it's unexpected."
"7265130","7269630"," So be really careful of the craziness that can happen in the end of the year."
"7270010","7274650"," How many, when I was on Twitter this morning, people were telling me, I was on Twitter this"
"7274650","7279490"," morning, people were saying, I was on Twitter this morning, people were saying things like, you, or"
"7279490","7284950"," yesterday, somebody was, people were like, I got DMs from people that I talked to, and they're"
"7284950","7286110"," like, can we really go to 4,800?"
"7286450","7288710"," And I was like, yeah, it's possible. "
"7290910","7293570"," And there are people that are saying things like, that can't happen."
"7293570","7296890"," And I was like, oh, you've never, I was like, this guy's got to be in the market for like"
"7296890","7297570"," three to five years."
"7297570","7302110"," I'm like, we can fucking, we can go like up a hundred points in the last day of the year. "
"7302110","7304070"," We can go up 300 points in five fucking days."
"7304070","7307350"," Like they pull some really funky ass shit."
"7309510","7311970"," Like, you know, those, seek and destroy. "
"7312330","7319410"," So just, just, if you were to tell me this in like, first week of January, like I'm fucking"
"7319410","7321970"," bearish, I'd be like, yeah, me too."
"7323070","7329630"," But like where we are November, December, maybe put some more time on that shit."
"7329810","7333530"," Like if you want to get bearish, if you told me I'm bearish here, I'd be like, well, what do"
"7333530","7334130"," you got for a date?"
"7334510","7336250"," I'd be like, do you have February or April?"
"7336470","7338390"," If they said, yeah, I'd be like, fuck yeah, you're good to go. "
"7339110","7345610"," But if you're like, next week we're going to crash, it'd be like, I don't know, man, maybe, but I'd"
"7345610","7347310"," be, I'd be very tactful."
"7347690","7351450"," But I'd be very, like, you know how like bulls have shit on them?"
"7351730","7355310"," Like, they got to do this and they got to do that and they got to do this and bears"
"7355310","7357930"," got to do this and bears got to do that right now for a bear."
"7359470","7363810"," The only reason, like if it was any of the time of the year, I'd say, well, not any of"
"7363810","7366770"," the time, like some certain times they'd be like, yeah, they're fucking right. "
"7367210","7372470"," Right now where we are, if they grind us sideways into the end of the year and then pull this"
"7372470","7378450"," bull shit, squeeze up into the end of the year, you're going to be left with holding your own dick,"
"7378590","7378730"," right?"
"7378890","7380890"," So just be tactful."
"7381990","7382610"," Be patient."
"7386350","7387330"," Have time on your shit. "
"7387330","7390570"," Put back spreads or your best friend, you know, that kind of stuff."
"7391470","7401410"," Or, or if you're not tactful, at least be more time or I guess the"
"7401410","7402210"," timing, right?"
"7409100","7410780"," How do I know that they're in or not?"
"7411160","7417960"," I get a report every morning, every morning and every night from like a black box stuff from"
"7417960","7419760"," Bloomberg terminal."
"7420060","7423620"," So I've got the I've got a stuff that's sent to me every morning and night. "
"7424880","7426440"," It's coming out of GS right now."
"7426440","7430620"," So you guys, I'm going to cut and paste it for you."
"7430680","7431520"," You guys want to see it?"
"7432700","7433600"," Hold on here. "
"7446620","7449860"," You guys, you guys want to see the, see the notes so you can see it."
"7450720","7451480"," Think tight here."
"7456070","7457150"," I'm going to read this to you. "
"7457290","7458270"," Well, I'll read this to you first."
"7463990","7466350"," You can skip this for you and just get it to you."
"7477080","7478360"," I'll show you guys this maybe. "
"7479340","7480660"," Where the fuck is that?"
"7482020","7483140"," That's simply, there we go."
"7492640","7493420"," Think tight here."
"7495260","7496440"," I move this over here. "
"7496660","7497080"," There we go."
"7498000","7500000"," You can read this if you want at home."
"7501780","7507540"," But I draw your attention to, this is from this morning, by the way, not yesterday. "
"7509540","7512640"," So just right here, just so you can see it right there."
"7516360","7518320"," You can read that for yourself at home."
"7532340","7534100"," Yeah, that's what I'm looking for here too. "
"7534240","7535260"," I'm with you on that springboard."
"7536320","7537000"," Looking for that check."
"7539280","7544660"," We got the, the spy doesn't have the, they got this one. "
"7544760","7545800"," I guess you could count that one."
"7546640","7548020"," I want to see this one right here."
"7551340","7561330"," I want to see, you guys know"
"7561330","7562450"," how we do this over here, right?"
"7562930","7565190"," Up here, back down, test that one. "
"7566290","7567330"," Yeah, right there."
"7568630","7569150"," Come back down."
"7569150","7569310"," Come back down. "
"7571570","7572470"," Now I'm right there."
"7574630","7576170"," You want to see what I'm looking for here?"
"7576370","7580210"," Someone else just said in chat, we spent a ton of time teaching you guys how to do this stuff."
"7580350","7584230"," But you guys, it seems like people in the chat already know what we're looking for here. "
"7584330","7587770"," So you're looking for the, squeeze up, down, up, down."
"7588570","7590450"," And you're looking for new highs all along the way."
"7590810","7592490"," So you got your first high right here. "
"7593310","7596770"," So your first high was, your first high was this one right here."
"7598330","7600730"," That was your first break, right?"
"7601270","7603590"," Up, up, slam, slam, slam."
"7604250","7604670"," Up again. "
"7605150","7606670"," Now you want to, you want to see a successful."
"7608990","7612270"," So you don't want to see, you don't want to see this fail right here."
"7613990","7615390"," We'll draw it down below here. "
"7616310","7617810"," You want to see this hold right here."
"7617890","7620210"," This is the confirmation for continued upside move."
"7621370","7625210"," If you look at the bottom down there, you want to see this hold right here. "
"7626790","7629410"," But if it holds, it's going to, it's going to fucking rip."
"7634110","7636170"," You just, you're just waiting patiently right here."
"7640570","7641170"," Is that?"
"7645950","7646750"," That one. "
"7650990","7655270"," Right there is what I want to see."
"7656650","7657790"," I don't want to see the failure."
"7658730","7660090"," And this one I think I'm good with right there. "
"7667670","7670410"," Well, the CTAs suck."
"7671910","7674730"," But there's a caveat to the CTAs sucking."
"7676090","7679190"," When they do get in, it like extends a rally. "
"7679550","7680730"," Do you got to say them a point with that?"
"7682010","7685870"," So it's a hard thing to say like the CTAs suck."
"7686550","7687750"," We've talked about them in the show."
"7687970","7692590"," I've taught, I've actually shown you when they, so apparently pull this out for you really quick. "
"7697500","7700200"," So if you guys on your own, right?"
"7701220","7702180"," See that book right there?"
"7702280","7702480"," Grab that."
"7702580","7703560"," You guys need to get this book."
"7703820","7705760"," If you haven't gotten this book, get this fucking book at home. "
"7705880","7705980"," Okay."
"7707460","7708080"," Right there."
"7708400","7709380"," Get that book right there. "
"7709400","7709580"," Okay."
"7710600","7715260"," Now there's other books in the series, but the reason you should get that book."
"7717680","7721520"," The reason you should get that book is because, the reason you guys should be getting that book is"
"7721520","7727120"," because you're like, so it's a long fucking conversation. "
"7727500","7729440"," Like it's not, it's not an out conversation."
"7731200","7732320"," Not in the day, right?"
"7735180","7739380"," Banks were very passive investors in the stock market."
"7740020","7743460"," They were, they were, they were, they were like very passive. "
"7743640","7743820"," Okay."
"7745460","7750680"," A way to talk about this would be, let me go back to the main screen so you guys can,"
"7758240","7760420"," what I don't want, let me put what I don't want to see."
"7761800","7763080"," I don't want to see that. "
"7763080","7771860"," I don't want to see as a failure here because we got the new high back here."
"7772040","7773980"," We got, we got the new high for this stuff in here."
"7774900","7776080"," So we're good right now. "
"7776080","7779780"," We're check marking that, but I don't want to see as any kind of break down below."
"7782600","7785560"," So what I, so let's, okay."
"7785840","7788740"," So banks used to be very passive investors. "
"7789060","7789160"," Okay."
"7789740","7797800"," And in the 80s and 90s, if like guys were getting to be like 50, 60 years old, right?"
"7798180","7801720"," Let's say I'm like, let's send the main investor for, for a big bank, right?"
"7801900","7802580"," Big prime bank."
"7804000","7810260"," And I go out my own and I start a hedge fund, right?"
"7811200","7814980"," And I have all these connections and friends in long time, people that trust me. "
"7815760","7821820"," And I, I leave, I leave Wells Fargo, I leave Pulfa, Pulfa D's nuts, right?"
"7822840","7827940"," And I start a hedge fund and I spend this story to prime bankers."
"7828120","7832140"," I'm like, hey, look, I already know you can't take all this risk."
"7832580","7833400"," So I'll do it. "
"7834120","7835280"," I'm one of your best traders."
"7835560","7836820"," I've been with you for 40 years, right?"
"7837520","7837980"," I'm a badass."
"7839740","7844320"," So they started to, to create these hedge funds to take on risk, right?"
"7845280","7850540"," And so these hedge funds, and then individual wealthy people as well, put risk on the market. "
"7850680","7851840"," They put on a real size here."
"7852120","7857800"," And these guys, women, men, mostly men, but many women, they, they've got more risky."
"7860620","7865460"," And these banks will fund these guys or were funding in the background quietly. "
"7866200","7869800"," Well, back to you in the background, you put the risk on, it's not going to destroy my bank."
"7870700","7872780"," And you guys can be the first ones in the marketplace, right?"
"7874300","7880060"," So if you read that book, there it tells you who enters first, that my point to this in that"
"7880060","7882680"," book is they tell you who enters the market first."
"7883420","7884740"," And they tell you who's late to the party. "
"7885080","7887700"," They talk about who comes in late to the party, that kind of stuff."
"7888060","7893080"," So even though CTA suck, even though they enter the market late, usually in a bull run, they are"
"7893080","7898120"," still usually like, it's almost like a forced buying of the market for the market to go higher."
"7898420","7898840"," Does that make sense?"
"7899700","7905060"," So if these assholes are, these big banks are like big elephants coming through, and they have to"
"7905060","7910820"," like show gains for the year, for the quarter, for the year, all that kind of stuff, you kind of"
"7910820","7914320"," have to be like, hey, the market should roll here, and it doesn't, and it ends up squeezing up even"
"7914320","7915760"," more, right?"
"7916300","7921280"," That late cycle of a bull run, there's that last thrust to the upside. "
"7921720","7924200"," So just be where, just be conscious of it."
"7924280","7929960"," You should read that book if you haven't, because it tells you these things are, like things about"
"7929960","7933720"," this are relatable things to CTA's inside that book."
"7933980","7941360"," So if you have the chance, go back there, or go read that book, and you'll understand my point"
"7941360","7941640"," here. "
"7942020","7948140"," And there are many examples of this in the past as well, many examples of the mentoring late, and"
"7948140","7948920"," not getting fucked."
"7949160","7951800"," You'd, they'd all be bankrupt right now, if that was the case."
"7951880","7957500"," So it's almost like forced, it's almost like forced price action to the upside. "
"7958560","7962440"," For the right reasons, no, for all the wrong fucking reasons, right?"
"7962540","7963200"," It's all about greed."
"7970590","7973670"," Yeah, and the same thing goes for selling too, right?"
"7974110","7979110"," Same thing goes, when you have real money selling in the market, there's nothing that the options"
"7979110","7982110"," market controls like 10% of the market, right?"
"7982430","7985410"," So like all your gamma gets thrown out the window, right?"
"7985710","7988450"," When you ever guys ever see when your gamma gets thrown out the window, and you're like, what the"
"7988450","7989030"," fuck is this?"
"7989930","7991070"," That's real money selling."
"7991370","7993170"," Same thing in the inverse on real money buying. "
"7993170","7995010"," So if you see these guys buying, right?"
"7995810","7999870"," They will run over your fucking gamma models on both sides."
"8000430","8004850"," So when the big boys step in, they do run the market."
"8005510","8011010"," Then you can like literally take your gamma or rip it up into pieces, and this is up and down,"
"8011270","8012670"," and just throw that shit in the trash. "
"8013050","8015430"," Because when they step in, they actually do move markets."
"8018560","8024140"," Well, you got like 25% of the market as retailers, it's a 35%."
"8025200","8028540"," Then you got like 25% to 35% of the market as banks. "
"8029520","8034680"," Then you got another like percentage of that is like mid-sized and big investors, big fish stuff"
"8034680","8035120"," like that."
"8035320","8037620"," And you got like, so you have like all these different entities."
"8038280","8040560"," We already know retailers are generally bullish. "
"8041040","8048140"," We have always different forces in the market that sometimes are important, and sometimes they're"
"8048140","8048340"," not."
"8048340","8054740"," So if I'm a bank and I'm not making any moves, right, if I'm just sitting on my hands, the"
"8054740","8056840"," options gamma takes over, right?"
"8057400","8063080"," Doesn't matter if you're selling or not buying, like it's like if I'm a major market mover, right?"
"8064160","8073280"," So I'm a major market mover, and I'm not buying or selling, like I'm a Wells Fargo, both Morgan"
"8073280","8078120"," Stanley, any of these guys, and if they're not buying or selling, that's when gamma takes over and"
"8078120","8079160"," starts to move the market, right?"
"8080240","8084540"," Let's say when they start selling, and then retailers start selling, they get scared, right?"
"8084920","8086040"," Sentiment, it's important, right?"
"8086540","8091320"," So you get like real money selling, then you get those sentiment selling, and that just becomes"
"8091320","8097560"," like a waterfall cascade downside, and you can also become a waterfall cascade to the upside."
"8097840","8099200"," It works on both ends. "
"8101000","8104020"," So you're, let me bring this up so you can see it better."
"8106620","8111360"," So be careful of that as my point."
"8111680","8117300"," Be careful of that if you're a seller here, that if these fucks are out there buying, they could"
"8117300","8120120"," drive this market up, and you're saying this isn't rational. "
"8120940","8122500"," Why is it going up right now?"
"8123400","8124720"," We've ever reason to go down."
"8124980","8129460"," Even just market breath is a good reason for us to go down, and they start fucking squeezing us up"
"8129460","8130100"," and up and up."
"8131120","8132940"," You're gonna be fucked, right?"
"8133380","8135380"," So just be careful end of this year, man. "
"8135380","8136360"," Be careful with these guys."
"8140740","8143940"," And when they own all the bags, guess what they sell into you?"
"8144720","8148020"," Once they've got them all, they just start selling any, they start telling you that we're going to"
"8148020","8148160"," the moon."
"8148600","8154640"," They'll start seeing CNBC coming out end of the year telling you bullshit like, I don't know, RK is"
"8154640","8155320"," gonna go up some more. "
"8155600","8156420"," Start, keep buying."
"8157300","8158660"," Or not, RK is not a good one."
"8158880","8160620"," My favorite one was RKG. "
"8161940","8164340"," CNBC was like, RK's got lots of legs."
"8164640","8166200"," Take your money to RK, go to RK."
"8166480","8168260"," They fucking sold RK down to the depths of hell. "
"8169940","8171740"," Made you bag hold all that shit."
"8172040","8172680"," That was a couple of years ago."
"8172680","8177940"," It was like two, three years ago, but it was hilarious to watch that on the news. "
"8178160","8180040"," I was like, these fucking guys own all these fucking bags."
"8180280","8184940"," They're selling into all these fucking, selling into all these late retailers getting into the"
"8184940","8185480"," market here."
"8187520","8188220"," Not a theory. "
"8189100","8189980"," This is not a theory."
"8190200","8190680"," This is fact."
"8192820","8196920"," What I'm talking about right now is not tap gyms like personal. "
"8197700","8201280"," I'm just making this shit up or stuff like that."
"8203020","8203920"," Good point though."
"8211610","8214190"," Yeah, right now, the thing that I was looking for here. "
"8214330","8216250"," All right, let me see what I can show you guys this."
"8220889","8233900"," So, black,"
"8234120","8234260"," baby."
"8237080","8237520"," Okay. "
"8238980","8240059"," No, no, no."
"8240059","8245410"," All right, fuck you then."
"8246969","8248150"," Uh, okay. "
"8249889","8251910"," So, do you want to know if you're bullish or bearish here?"
"8252950","8253690"," I'll tell you."
"8253889","8257790"," Well, it's not every time, but, you know, 70% of the time."
"8259690","8262170"," So, here's some price action here. "
"8262290","8262889"," You guys want to see this?"
"8269530","8272490"," So, give it all this price action here."
"8272490","8272730"," So, let's see what we're looking for here."
"8275910","8277209"," Ten none of this happened yet. "
"8278950","8280410"," And none of that happened yet, okay?"
"8281010","8281350"," Ten none."
"8281450","8283809"," We don't know what's happened, okay?"
"8285790","8287129"," Just right there, okay?"
"8287389","8288090"," Ten none of this is here."
"8288889","8289270"," It's all gone. "
"8289430","8290250"," All this shit's gone, okay?"
"8292770","8297230"," You were looking for see these previous eyes right here."
"8298530","8299709"," Right, previous eye."
"8299709","8304690"," My new low went down right on buyers back up here. "
"8305790","8308770"," What you're looking for is more rejection down here."
"8309629","8311090"," Not having that rejection."
"8312370","8317610"," Uh, bulls were looking for take out this previous eye right here and they did. "
"8318309","8323070"," So, bulls took that previous eye out, then they took this previous eye out right here."
"8323870","8326950"," So, you knocked that one out, you knocked that one out."
"8327590","8334790"," So, all you're doing right now is then coming down to check that one minute trigger, which is right"
"8334790","8335010"," here. "
"8335129","8339030"," And the implication would be that we should go up, okay?"
"8341990","8351570"," Now, if, if we failed this high right here, right?"
"8352090","8354030"," We had the, we failed it right there, right?"
"8355690","8356990"," The expectation would go down, right?"
"8357090","8359950"," We did went up, so we broke through this one right here, right?"
"8360770","8365750"," So, the idea would be that this will hold and we beat this one, this one."
"8365850","8367750"," So, the next one above is up here, the left hand side."
"8368030","8371549"," So, the expectation up here would be 451 flat. "
"8371889","8374570"," Now, I don't know if that means end of day."
"8376270","8380049"," I don't know if that's just like this takes till four o'clock to get to, but the expectation would"
"8380049","8381910"," be that we go up there."
"8382049","8386370"," Just like the expectation that we would roll here, we didn't, we went up, but the expectation we"
"8386370","8389810"," would roll down there due to these previous low, low, low. "
"8390690","8392250"," We didn't wait, we broke up higher."
"8392530","8395130"," So, sure, there's a bear out there that's hurting right now."
"8395590","8397590"," There's a, there's someone short right now, it's getting pain. "
"8399330","8401150"," So, we'll see if this thing pushes up."
"8401650","8404090"," The office reverses back to the downside, starts heading lower."
"8405810","8411990"," It's underneath here and that this reverses, you get your double, you get your, if we fail this one"
"8411990","8418430"," right here, I'll, I'll change my stance back to bearish. "
"8418430","8428270"," So, if there is a rejection here and you see price, reverse, and we start to see something like"
"8428270","8432650"," that, I will get more bearish."
"8434410","8436550"," So, we start to see price reject here."
"8437390","8441330"," It's like a big red, big red bar down here that comes back up and starts to reject office. "
"8442530","8443430"," I'll get bearish with you."
"8474070","8477630"," So, right now you've got, so right now you've got two things going on."
"8477790","8485730"," You've got, so just so you know, dealers right now are long SPX, okay?"
"8486610","8491350"," Dealers are long SPX and CTAs are buying it, SPX. "
"8492010","8494230"," So, you have an amplified move to the upside right now."
"8494310","8495790"," That's why we have a squeeze going on right now."
"8499670","8501950"," That's why we have, that's why we have the squeeze at this point. "
"8502570","8509400"," I think that here, I got something I got to do here in the background."
"8510480","8512140"," Oh shit, I got to show you guys this."
"8514060","8517160"," I wonder what I want to show you guys, I guess I'm not going to be able to show you"
"8517160","8517520"," guys that. "
"8519220","8520560"," I already deleted it."
"8524520","8530500"," I was going to show you guys what, but maybe I'll bring it back up, hold on, let me have"
"8530500","8530920"," a second here."
"8547850","8550830"," Let's see if we can, let's see if we can go through this and read this to you. "
"8551950","8553190"," Let me make this simpler here."
"8567320","8570020"," I don't know what it's saying, something I want to tell about delta hedging."
"8571420","8576120"," Anyways, so dealers are long calls here in their short puts and SPX. "
"8578060","8580460"," Dealers have no interest in taking on directional risk."
"8580460","8582520"," I think you should already know that, you probably do."
"8583140","8586840"," So they take dynamic, then they're positioning in the underlying, that's to be adjusted frequently"
"8586840","8591360"," as the market moves around, simple delta hedging examples, investors buy a put from a dealer,"
"8591840","8596520"," dealers, dealers, dealers long the market via writing a put and hedges that risk by selling the"
"8596520","8596780"," underlying. "
"8597280","8599780"," If the market goes down, the investors put increases in value."
"8599980","8601300"," The dealer has to sell in the underlying."
"8601780","8605020"," If the market goes up, however the dealer has to buy back the underlying. "
"8606000","8612340"," If the market goes up, if the buy back the underlying, that's why we're sort of short gamma regime"
"8612340","8612980"," right now."
"8613640","8616280"," Oh, no, we're not in a short, we're a long gamma regime right now."
"8622490","8626470"," Well, no, we're short gamma, but can make move at the market. "
"8627110","8630750"," My word salad in this right now."
"8631330","8638070"," It's like short gamma, but to the long side, not the short side, it's a hard thing to put this"
"8638070","8639550"," in a word and I'm like, how do I explain this?"
"8645830","8647410"," Um, gamma flip, hold on."
"8647510","8648850"," You guys want to see the gamma flip, hold on. "
"8648950","8649830"," Show it to you guys right here."
"8654510","8655170"," Pink type."
"8661270","8663290"," Give me one quick second here. "
"8663530","8667690"," Where is, let me go over to the trigger screen here."
"8677020","8678200"," What are we doing?"
"8678700","8679360"," Load layout."
"8680880","8683440"," Who want to do gamma, baby?"
"8684240","8685200"," Who want to do gamma?"
"8687320","8690700"," And we're going to load some gamma today's numbers in. "
"8691000","8691380"," Hold on here."
"8706430","8707390"," Oh, yeah."
"8709730","8711430"," So you guys want the gamma flip?"
"8715270","8715750"," 4450. "
"8718050","8719030"," All right, 76."
"8719490","8721410"," Remember we talked about the 76 million last time we talked."
"8721410","8723810"," I said, hey, the 76 is your next target up here. "
"8725050","8728110"," Your next target is 4555 right here."
"8728870","8732710"," And then above that, your next, you have a minor, minor one right here."
"8733210","8734170"," Do a minor. "
"8738370","8739950"," Big node right here."
"8741350","8742710"," Big node right here."
"8746770","8750330"," And right now we're just slamming into this 76 million node. "
"8751750","8754370"," Like bash, bash, bash, bash, get above."
"8755070","8755430"," Hold on."
"8755550","8757290"," I got to delete all that because it's offset now. "
"8758470","8762850"," And I'm going to bash, bash, bash, and try to get up there and squeeze up there and grab that."
"8764070","8765030"," Right 45."
"8767170","8768650"," Yeah, it's 4550. "
"8770110","8770830"," Gamma flip."
"8774530","8775790"," 4450 right now."
"8778690","8783190"," 4450, next target right here. "
"8799390","8800610"," What's your next target right there?"
"8806190","8807350"," You guys want that for home?"
"8807470","8809270"," You can snip this for yourself."
"8810710","8812250"," Let me see, should I make a bigger?"
"8812450","8812710"," I don't know."
"8813530","8814770"," You guys can see that. "
"8815390","8816630"," Gamma flip is right here."
"8820570","8822550"," Market, very supportive right now."
"8826250","8827790"," You're buying the calls, baby. "
"8832390","8832890"," You're welcome."
"8833050","8833190"," Don't worry."
"8833290","8833730"," I got you guys. "
"8836410","8837950"," All right, we're done with that for now."
"8843890","8844730"," Oh, shit."
"8844970","8845970"," I just deleted that one. "
"8846050","8847390"," I just deleted the NVIDIA thing."
"8849230","8849630"," NVDA."
"8850710","8851370"," Come on here. "
"8852950","8856110"," Oh, let me go back over to the main screen here for you first."
"8857130","8857530"," Start."
"8857530","8860370"," All these horse traders in here. "
"8862370","8863970"," Look at them, and you can just look at them."
"8864050","8864590"," Look at them."
"8864650","8864850"," Look at them. "
"8864850","8864930"," Look at them."
"8864930","8866370"," Look at them just selling into it."
"8867410","8869430"," Look at that big fat red bar up there. "
"8869530","8871310"," Some fat bastard wants to go up there."
"8871810","8873710"," That big red bar to the upside on."
"8875390","8876810"," I got to get rid of this stuff. "
"8882190","8882550"," Options."
"8883490","8887910"," I want to show you guys one of the things for me."
"8891970","8892450"," VDA. "
"8895610","8902410"," The one last thing we're going to look at really quick is what the fuck is that?"
"8902910","8903630"," All right here."
"8903770","8904290"," We're going to look at this."
"8906110","8906710"," Like tap screen. "
"8907650","8908910"," Okay, so right here."
"8910950","8911990"," Close that shit up."
"8912530","8918330"," I want you guys to pay attention to my cursor right here, okay?"
"8920210","8922110"," Uh, this right here. "
"8923370","8924810"," Pay attention to that right there."
"8927050","8933830"," And this is up right."
"8934270","8934970"," August up. "
"8936770","8937430"," May up."
"8938710","8939290"," February up."
"8940910","8944010"," Down, but still upward trend November. "
"8945130","8945570"," August."
"8947870","8952690"," We had the quick rip to the upside and then sell it down, right?"
"8953270","8956210"," A little bit of selling down and then up over here."
"8958470","8962290"," Nvidia tends to, looks like it stays on trend, doesn't it?"
"8963070","8965410"," Trend to the downside, trend to the upside. "
"8966610","8968490"," Trend to the upside, trend to the upside."
"8969270","8972930"," Hit a pretty big moment, hit it a moment over here and then they rolled it, okay?"
"8972930","8975070"," It's like major resistance over here."
"8975890","8977910"," But I've pretty much stayed on trend. "
"8978650","8979910"," Same thing, March up."
"8980550","8983810"," February down, but staying on trend."
"8984670","8988330"," See, November up hit a price target, then started to roll. "
"8989310","8990850"," Okay, this is November of 2021."
"8992910","8995070"," November of 2022."
"8996390","8998290"," Right in here, stayed on trend. "
"8998870","9007170"," So if there was one thing to take away from Nvidia or NVDA, it would be expect friend to stay,"
"9007850","9012610"," expect us to stay on trend for NVDA."
"9012770","9014430"," I wouldn't expect it to be like Tesla, right?"
"9014570","9018030"," Where they sell the news and then we come back and trade it with that kind of stuff."
"9018970","9021270"," So NVDA expect and expect. "
"9023230","9029790"," Historically, at least from previous earnings reports, if NVDA is going up, expect it to go up."
"9030370","9032870"," If it's going down, expect it to continue to the downside."
"9033350","9041790"," And expect it to respect major, major ceilings or major supply zones. "
"9043130","9044590"," I should rephrase that."
"9046750","9048750"," Oh, these bears are going to get fucked here."
"9051490","9055510"," These bears will pay attention to this one right here too. "
"9059430","9061550"," You want to see us get above that one right there too."
"9067490","9068970"," They're really trying here, right?"
"9069790","9071610"," I'm going to park this bitch right into the clothes."
"9075050","9076990"," I'm like green, red, green, red. "
"9077310","9079750"," Now I'm down seven cents right now."
"9084650","9086390"," Nine cents, I'm down right now."
"9088930","9090450"," I'm going to read something to you right here. "
"9091070","9093430"," We're going to talk about Mike Barrie."
"9099330","9103610"," Mike Barrie famously shorted subprime mortgages during the 2008 financial crisis, then got the"
"9103610","9107350"," movie Big Short Made after him just was just wrong in a big way."
"9108030","9112310"," Back in August, we covered Barrie's $1.6 billion short position, the SP500 and that's like 100"
"9112310","9113570"," well, he was wrong, very wrong. "
"9114170","9118130"," This week, Barrie closed this short position for an estimated loss of 40%."
"9119490","9124890"," Oh, this time he's shorting semiconductors."
"9128350","9130470"," Oh boy, we're going to talk about this too. "
"9133770","9138550"," We're going to talk semiconductors because you got Piper Sandler out there saying no, right?"
"9145390","9158590"," We got Barrie's"
"9158590","9165710"," Fund signed capital's newest position shorting 100,000 shares of BlackRock's semi-conductor ETF"

"9180490","9188010"," Some of the companies that are involved in S-O-X that we don't know is NVDA, AMD, INTC, TSM,"
"9188330","9189110"," all the usual suspects. "
"9190210","9192290"," So we're going to take a look at this ETF next."
"9192830","9197810"," So we're going to look at S-O-X and the Michael Barrie's short and we're going to take a"
"9197810","9199130"," quick look at that one right now."
"9200490","9202550"," So we're going to look at S-O-X-X. "
"9205830","9206950"," We're going to take a look at this one."
"9208650","9209890"," This one's all over the place."
"9211590","9214650"," I'm going to say something to Michael Barrie. "
"9215550","9216890"," I've got to say something about him."
"9220460","9229820"," Somebody, if any of you know Michael Barrie, my bro, if you guys know my bro back there, I got"
"9229820","9232980"," that one, that guy right there."
"9233100","9238760"," If you guys know that guy right there, he should just shut the fuck up and get off Twitter. "
"9239680","9242220"," But just get the fuck off Twitter."
"9242560","9245880"," Like, I don't know why the fuck he's out there telling people he's short."
"9246660","9247860"," I kind of understand. "
"9248600","9249960"," I kind of understand."
"9251260","9251860"," He's early."
"9252920","9260600"," What he wants to do, or I'm assuming here, that he has enough money that he's looking for this"
"9260600","9261020"," maybe. "
"9263720","9266440"," Maybe he can take that right there, but I'll tell you what."
"9267340","9268160"," What is that?"
"9272060","9272540"," 531."
"9274560","9276140"," High probability we go up there. "
"9278200","9280320"," And there's a high probability that whatever we..."
"9289610","9290650"," Oh, hold on."
"9291030","9292670"," We got some great stuff coming out right now."
"9295430","9300390"," Like, can he absorb that, I guess, to be the question. "
"9303480","9307640"," Why not just short it once it starts to roll?"
"9308100","9308840"," I don't get that."
"9309160","9310840"," Or break below the hourly trigger."
"9311620","9312320"," I don't understand. "
"9312760","9314300"," I don't understand what he's doing."
"9316920","9318920"," Velocity is not bad right now."
"9320200","9322000"," Velocity still has more room to run. "
"9326170","9327530"," I'm going to go with..."
"9327530","9329370"," Barry is wrong for right now."
"9329650","9331010"," He could be right down the road."
"9331370","9336890"," But let's look at it on a daily chart and see if he's seeing something. "
"9338470","9338950"," Yeah."
"9340590","9341070"," No."
"9343610","9344910"," Man, I'll tell you what. "
"9345790","9346270"," Dude."
"9350360","9351420"," That's a fucking thing."
"9354390","9356170"," That's the wrong way to look at it. "
"9358510","9361050"," This fucking thing is likely going up there."
"9361550","9363890"," And that fucking thing is likely going up there."
"9364650","9366230"," And then maybe you get the roll. "
"9368750","9369330"," Maybe."
"9370130","9370430"," Maybe."
"9372470","9373730"," Maybe you get that. "
"9375170","9376950"," I'm not seeing..."
"9376950","9378990"," We're in accumulation on a quarterly basis."
"9380410","9382330"," We're at zero line in the..."
"9382330","9384830"," We still haven't accumulated semiconductors here."
"9385570","9387870"," Just starting the ramp on the weekly to the upside. "
"9388410","9390030"," I don't know where the fuck is coming from right now."
"9390270","9391190"," Daily's just coming up."
"9392550","9394990"," I'm going to go against Michael Barry on this. "
"9395170","9396530"," I don't know why he's on that trade."
"9397090","9398270"," Does he know something that we don't know?"
"9399230","9400310"," I'd be very..."
"9400310","9401790"," I don't know why the fuck he's doing that."
"9402110","9403670"," I don't know what he's doing. "
"9404750","9405170"," No."
"9406510","9407570"," No, Michael Barry."
"9409310","9411150"," I don't know why that shorts on. "
"9412390","9413790"," He just lost fucking."
"9413790","9415430"," He just lost what?"
"9417350","9420950"," $12 billion or $18 billion or something insane like that."
"9421390","9423150"," I don't know. "
"9425190","9430070"," Yeah, that squeeze, baby."
"9434250","9436270"," Yeah, that fucking squeeze, dude."
"9438370","9439230"," Michael Barry. "
"9444130","9445590"," He's just got fucking social media."
"9445810","9446690"," Put the fucking short on."
"9446790","9447210"," Don't tell anybody. "
"9448390","9450950"," Like the first thing is he's got like..."
"9450950","9451790"," He's got dealers."
"9452110","9453410"," They're going to fucking fuck with you."
"9453510","9455070"," Like dealers are going to take the opposite of the trade, right?"
"9455350","9455570"," Delta neutral. "
"9456770","9459230"," Then you got all these other assholes."
"9459590","9461390"," Retailers are going to jump on the same trade with them."
"9462150","9463450"," So he's thinking it delta hedged again. "
"9464670","9466030"," He should just shut up publicly."
"9470210","9471670"," Yeah, that's a possibility too."
"9472110","9473710"," But he went public about it, it looks like. "
"9473710","9476610"," So I could see that I could..."
"9476610","9477050"," Yes."
"9477570","9478190"," So who just said that?"
"9478290","9479090"," Carillo just said that."
"9479450","9479930"," Carillo. "
"9480830","9482210"," There is that possibility."
"9482850","9485650"," That is definitely possible that he is long the underlying."
"9486370","9488770"," And he's actually hedging a position. "
"9490290","9491330"," That is a possibility."
"9491690","9495810"," If nobody said that or if he hasn't divulged that, that is very fucking true."
"9497210","9501190"," But I don't understand why he'd just be short socks right here because nothing says that he should"
"9501190","9501390"," be. "
"9502270","9503670"," Socks is very bullish here."
"9506070","9516050"," No, I think Carillo Low is probably has the most rational explanation for why he's short would be"
"9516050","9516350"," that."
"9516850","9518110"," That he's long the underlying. "
"9518350","9520950"," That's the only thing that I could think of that would be it."
"9522570","9526190"," And that last thing or that last..."
"9529350","9536370"," That 40% loss, the $1.6 billion short position that he had the NASDAQ 100."
"9537930","9544030"," That question, Carillo Low, that question was raised as well on that last short that he had. "
"9544550","9546410"," People said we don't know if he's long."
"9547530","9549150"," The underlying on that short."
"9553970","9556110"," Yeah, it's 1.6 billion notional. "
"9557230","9559910"," A short position, SP500 and the NASDAQ."
"9560010","9563350"," I said NASDAQ, but he was on the one NASDAQ 100 and the SP500."
"9568110","9569230"," He closed it this weekend. "
"9571370","9573130"," As a matter of fact, you guys want to link to it."
"9578440","9580480"," Here, I'll give you guys the link real quick."
"9580600","9582380"," We're having time now at the bottom of the hour. "
"9582660","9585020"," Do you see the release at the top of the hour?"
"9585220","9586120"," Is that 1p and Eastern time?"
"9586580","9587560"," You got some cool for you guys."
"9587700","9588300"," Guys, you guys want some cool?"
"9589040","9590580"," So the oil rigs, sorry."
"9590580","9591680"," Pink tighter, I got some cool. "
"9591780","9594040"," I got a cool, I got a cool, I got a cool rabbit hole for you."
"9594040","9595380"," Five, six hundred and sixteen."
"9597460","9598600"," Carillo Low, I wish I wasn't. "
"9603140","9612460"," I know it's like, it's like, it's like when I'm like, I always talk about like, well, I don't tell"
"9612460","9612920"," them on a stream."
"9612980","9618400"," I tell them on other people, but I'm like, I don't know."
"9618400","9623700"," If you see me, if you see me trade like, I don't know, 500 bucks for three thousand dollars and"
"9623700","9628960"," spy zero dates, I'm like, did I just, I just burned that. "
"9629060","9632760"," I'm like, well, did you follow me on the, on the spread trade for 20 or 30 grand?"
"9632920","9633300"," They're like, no."
"9634280","9638460"," Just following me in the $13,000 spy trade for call spreads."
"9638860","9638920"," No. "
"9639700","9640080"," Okay."
"9640520","9641900"," Well, what did you follow me on?"
"9642280","9643220"," Just zero dates cap."
"9643860","9644420"," What else did you do?"
"9644760","9646780"," Rolled them into another position. "
"9646780","9650040"," Then I, you know, I doubled down and tripled down until I fucking burned."
"9651980","9653100"," How much money do you have?"
"9653340","9654060"," A thousand bucks cap."
"9654460","9654880"," I'm like, okay. "
"9655080","9656560"," So you're trading with your whole account here?"
"9658200","9665060"," The Carillo is like, like making a very fair point, like, what is he long or what is he short"
"9665060","9666440"," while he's long while he's short?"
"9667400","9668600"," How much money is he doing elsewhere?"
"9670720","9672800"," Did I post that for you guys in YouTube?"
"9673140","9674020"," Let me post this in YouTube."
"9677480","9678980"," I'll post this for you guys."
"9679100","9679760"," Want a cool rabbit hole?"
"9680220","9681500"," I got a cool rabbit hole for you. "
"9682160","9685980"," I think I do."
"9687160","9687900"," You're on YouTube."
"9688700","9690900"," I just posted this in Twitch stream. "
"9691100","9692300"," You don't get on the rabbit hole on scion."
"9693240","9693640"," Skyon."
"9698620","9700460"," Post that link for you in YouTube. "
"9700600","9708060"," So if you want to look at Mike Bari's data, there's your, uh, there's, there's probably the best"
"9708060","9709100"," link you can look at right now."
"9713470","9715750"," You can see, let me read some of your comments right now."
"9715870","9716570"," You can see Baron, thanks. "
"9716710","9718450"," Given only because global situation."
"9718650","9721230"," So if all no one wants to hold four or five day low, we can still solve, maybe."
"9722330","9729850"," I'm like, I'm not necessarily bearish, but I'm looking for a dip to buy a more, well, I'm looking"
"9729850","9738350"," for that dip buy down below or if we can get above this, um, this call wall, then I'll, I'll"
"9738350","9739630"," get, I'll, I'll just buy it. "
"9739670","9740130"," We'll start running."
"9740830","9741770"," So it's one of the other."
"9741810","9745990"," Either we either bring above that call wall, and we start running higher, or you're looking for a"
"9745990","9747610"," dip to the, to the downside to buy. "
"9748470","9750030"," So right now we're below it."
"9751370","9757630"," So if you, you know, and none of this, none of this price action to be matters today, like this"
"9757630","9760110"," price action for today doesn't really mean as much to me."
"9760490","9763390"," And then you've also, there's some of them at a point that they won't hold over. "
"9763490","9763790"," Thanks, Kevin."
"9764050","9766110"," Then you've got, you also have this other problem too."
"9766750","9772150"," The other problem, the other like flying the ointments is, uh, and a month or beginning of the"
"9772150","9773690"," month flows, haven't come into the market yet. "
"9773910","9776950"," So that stuff might not come in until the first week of November."
"9777750","9784390"," So you got like this week, next week, another week of like garbage shit, two, three weeks of"
"9784390","9789530"," sideways and up and down, and then the actual move up for the end of the quarter."
"9793250","9796450"," Yeah, yeah, no, I agree. "
"9796450","9797310"," I agree, Crillo."
"9803860","9804840"," Yeah, I, I agree."
"9805000","9807420"," He could definitely be long con, a convex call options right now. "
"9814620","9816900"," I just gave you the link to show you what he's long in the market."
"9817120","9817300"," You did."
"9817420","9818120"," I just showed it to you. "
"9819820","9822440"," So we're surely expecting the results for the U.S. at Baker Hughes."
"9822600","9824520"," Rick account can be slightly delayed."
"9824880","9826620"," And once released, they won't leave with the oil recount. "
"9829180","9830320"," Should we talk about CL?"
"9830880","9832900"," You got any guys want any interest in looking at oil?"
"9834040","9836540"," I've heard whispers, everybody getting excited about oil."
"9836780","9837640"," I could talk about that next."
"9837840","9839080"," XPI haven't done yet. "
"9839240","9840540"," I haven't, I can do XPI next."
"9842160","9843820"," Put your seatbelts on bowls."
"9849430","9850870"," Put your seatbelts on here. "

"9885910","9888790"," I think it's a small time frame here, but it's it's looking pretty bad."
"9888810","9889910"," It's getting that bear flag going."
"9893070","9894550"," It's getting that bear flag going. "
"9895370","9897750"," Probably Monday you'll see that that that come in."
"9908840","9910480"," No SP will move it up."

"10004100","10006600"," one thing that the thing that scares me the most is AI."
"10007180","10010840"," AI the software that runs the market is not what scares me."
"10011900","10017460"," What scares me is people talked about 1987 crash right a few weeks ago a month ago someone was"
"10017460","10023940"," saying we're gonna get a 1987 style crash and I was like now you're not gonna get that crash and"
"10023940","10030420"," to me the crash 87 was computing software and hardware. "
"10033120","10040620"," The greatest I was like you think we're saying 87 style crash because of what when they gave the"
"10040620","10044380"," reasons to me I was like no no no no it was because of a fucking glitch."
"10046020","10050480"," If you want to see that 1987 style crash this time it's probably going to be AI because they are"
"10050480","10051080"," using it."
"10051320","10052060"," They've admitted to it. "
"10052640","10060760"," Matter of fact they've admitted to it for Matter of fact the feds been using AI since I think 2016"
"10060760","10061660"," maybe."
"10062600","10064980"," Don't quote me on that year it was either 12 or 16."
"10066620","10071520"," I went actually went back a few weeks ago and looked it up again and then they're doing more of"
"10071520","10072240"," it this past year. "
"10073240","10078300"," They've been the feds been talking about but banks started showing this that they've been doing it"
"10079900","10083940"," as of late and they're full board right now."
"10083940","10085480"," Like banks are like full board and AI."
"10085480","10091680"," They're like oh no it still needs the human interaction for the or it still needs the human element"
"10091680","10095100"," for us to have that kind of crash but I am afraid of that. "
"10097020","10098780"," I'm more afraid of AI than software."
"10099660","10101980"," No I guess that is still software but I guess maybe you're right."
"10102120","10102860"," Maybe you are fucking right. "
"10103200","10103740"," You said software."
"10104700","10108300"," We find it and say AI that's probably that's probably one big bit danger."
"10114380","10115240"," Generally AI. "
"10117480","10120900"," Not written not written language AI."
"10121640","10123720"," I'll show you I'll let me write that stuff down."
"10125500","10133620"," I'll show you the stuff on what they've released publicly. "
"10138060","10140100"," Like what we know publicly from them."
"10140600","10150000"," The fucking the fed dude came out in June or March this year and they admitted that they actually"
"10150000","10152800"," outlined how they use AI with social media."
"10153500","10159640"," They're watching if you don't know this public knowledge they've publicly said it that they are"
"10161320","10170580"," paying attention to social media and they're not dredging social media but looking for specific. "
"10171280","10179220"," Looking for how you and I speak and then how a financial advisor the lingo that you use kind of"
"10179220","10183360"," tells if you're a professional or a retailer."
"10183820","10187100"," And so they get sentiments sentiment from Twitter and other places."
"10189360","10199200"," They actually tailor that policy to not to but based on what professionals and amateurs"
"10199200","10206020"," think fail or they don't necessarily say we're going to make policy to what these people think but"
"10206020","10210520"," they do use that that does bear upon how they implement policy. "
"10211300","10220560"," The thing you don't know is if they're like how much are they using AI right now for that decision"
"10220560","10229000"," like I'm going to assume the fed's not using it on like rate decisions but it would not shock me"
"10229000","10237280"," if it came public that they were being used in a yield so and their auctions and stuff like that."
"10237680","10243020"," It wouldn't shock me I wouldn't like they came out like two years three years and said they were"
"10243020","10246240"," making all these decisions for us I wouldn't be like oh that shocked at that."
"10246720","10247980"," So no that shit shocks me. "
"10254930","10258790"," They did not have market halts back in 1987 you're absolutely right."
"10258790","10260430"," They had to actually make a market."
"10260750","10265770"," They had they were actually on the phone trying to make a market not on the phone bunch phones"
"10265770","10272170"," trying to make a market rather than having those stops in place 100 percent that is absolutely"
"10272170","10273550"," fucking true they did not have. "
"10281930","10283150"," AI is hallucinate."
"10284590","10294510"," Yeah my suspicion so if if you've got people you see traders using learn language models for their"
"10294510","10301870"," own trading so if you've got some dipshit doing it on youtube or on twitter or whatever they're"
"10301870","10308630"," probably fucking around with this on a much larger scale in the background so I don't fucking"
"10308630","10312310"," they're not going to tell you but they're not going to tell you that they're not using it to make"
"10312310","10322290"," for decision making until after the fact they don't tell you as they're doing it right so I"
"10322290","10327890"," think they're doing it yeah I'm so fucking lutely I think I got I think you could kind of get"
"10327890","10337350"," kind of see it last year you guys remember you guys remember when volatility was being pushed I'm"
"10337350","10344950"," not going to say who but people were pushing like volatility as a investment product I agree with"
"10344950","10349490"," some of those statements but and there was there was a lot of the market was doing a lot of"
"10349490","10357490"," if you look at the market on like a three or five year time frame it's looking really sketchy like"
"10357490","10367450"," the market could become the market could become more volatile more instead"
"10367450","10376290"," if this was like five years instead of this shit right here we're seeing like whoo yeah baby you"
"10376290","10384970"," know that cut like like losing almost like a death rattle in a vehicle like a death they call them"
"10384970","10391790"," I think it's called death roll or death rattle or so it's when you're front end suspension is going"
"10391790","10396430"," out and you'll hit a high rate of speed and the truck starts to shake and rattle and move left"
"10396430","10402370"," and right and stuff like that and I think we have seen some of that past few years what I"
"10402370","10412010"," used to notice the biggest thing that I noticed it started I don't"
"10412010","10423230"," know um I started to notice I started to notice five years ago COVID's"
"10423230","10429770"," a weird thing like it was pre-COVID I hope you supposed this on Twitter I used to say like"
"10429770","10441860"," um if you'll watch the bottom screen on this broadcast right um if so"
"10441860","10449960"," back in the day if the market was going up we'd like go up like this real easy you know"
"10449960","10456100"," the market was going down going down pretty easy you could like jump on yeah I got some puts"
"10456100","10463740"," everything's awesome right uh now though what I notice is let's say this is a one month period"
"10463740","10470460"," right here and let's this a one month period right here and where you used to see action like this"
"10470460","10478080"," for that one month now you see action like this even if we're going up you see shit like this"
"10480960","10490730"," going up and instead of that you see this and it it's it's become way more"
"10490730","10499390"," glaring uh and that is high frequency trading that is um not just software but likely"
"10499390","10508150"," um trying to like capture every last intrinsic value out of everything that's out there so there's"
"10508150","10513850"," like this max like like it's like maximize you know what it reminds me of it reminds me of um"
"10513850","10523490"," it reminds me of fucking it reminds me of the fucking um of the mortgage crisis that we had right"
"10523490","10528410"," like you just you're getting as much juice as you can get out of mortgages so then you package them"
"10528410","10535130"," AAA and then you start to fudge the AAA packaging just to maximize and squeeze out every last"
"10535130","10540690"," fucking penny in dollar or creating a market within a market right so if you get the market where"
"10540690","10546230"," the market's going to go from I don't know ten dollars to twenty dollars but but but what it"
"10546230","10551030"," explains to me if the market used to go from like ten to twenty and then pull back to five"
"10551030","10554730"," and then go we're going to actually pull back to fifteen then go to twenty five then pull back"
"10554730","10560930"," twenty you know like this normal up and down action some fucking smart guy or woman or whatever was"
"10560930","10565630"," like yeah you know what we can do we'll create a market within that market we're not going to stop"
"10565630","10571010"," the price going from uh ten to fifteen dollars we're going to do a whole bunch of shit in between"
"10571010","10578650"," ten to fifteen dollars and build all these products inside of this stuff so we can put like it's"
"10578650","10583810"," it's very similar to repackaging mortgages shitty mortgages it's like you know I don't know if I'm"
"10583810","10588030"," explaining that right but it's just like a market within a market within a market within a market"
"10588030","10596970"," and they're fully participating because they have they have they got fucking uh they got AI or they"
"10596970","10601710"," got HFTs they're like it's quants like it's not quants it's these is all this all computing it was"
"10601710","10609010"," quants at one time but this is all this is pure pure computing at this point I think there are"
"10609010","10615290"," still quants out there not discount quants just saying that the lollipop is in the fucking mouth of"
"10615290","10623750"," AI it it presents itself like the lollipop is in someone else's fucking hand that's not human in my"
"10623750","10628510"," in my experience I don't know if this is your experience I've been trading for I used to be like"
"10628510","10634250"," 10 years I think I've been trading 15 years now so if you've been trading 10 20 years 30 years"
"10634250","10642810"," have you noticed this or not I noticed it uh and I've noticed it like increase over past six years"
"10642810","10656500"," mostly maybe 10 years glaring um recently but ETFs"
"10656500","10663980"," in the devil I think what it means is uh they want you to play more by the use I"
"10663980","10670820"," think there used to be a time bliss is going to date me so I think there was a time"
"10672320","10680440"," how I noticed this is I was a member of Wall Street Bets at the start um there was a"
"10680440","10687080"," lot of arbitrage that you could you could do you can still do that arbitrage but not like you used"
"10687080","10693620"," to be able to do it and um I think that's the glaring uh I think that's how I see"
"10693620","10702700"," it is that you've got um I used to be able to see more arbitrage than I do I can"
"10702700","10708580"," still see it not as well as I used to and the opportunity for it is rarer than it once"
"10708580","10714460"," was you'd see more like stability in markets and then you'd see something off the wall happen you"
"10714460","10722800"," knew what was going to happen uh what I see these days oftentimes is it'll happen at the but they"
"10722800","10727420"," save it it's like it's like the it's like there's a it's like a computer program out there that"
"10727420","10733400"," knows we we have to do this but we're going to do it when they're not paying attention right so"
"10733400","10737020"," you're like this is when I would normally expect this to happen and then now it's now it's going to"

"12055810","12063050"," it so uh not just the cheaper version i'm trying to launch some kind of a reversion then like a"
"12063050","12068270"," mid-tared version and then right now we only have the expensive version and i don't want to do i'm"
"12068270","12074730"," not gonna be like hey you got to pay all this money for this fucking thing i just got to"
"12074730","12087440"," check in with these guys and make sure i"

"12099880","12106440"," you because we don't have a fucking tool at this point number one i want a tool that you guys"
"12106440","12115980"," can see for the major uh indexes on our website now you can't manipulate it or anything like that"
"12115980","12119580"," but you guys can just see it every day and be like okay i'm looking for this and i'm looking"
"12119580","12125900"," for that right and you got like the major indexes fair and simple that should be like something"
"12125900","12130040"," that's like basically free like five ten bucks like you're supporting what we're doing you're"
"12130040","12135080"," supporting the work that we're doing the cost to us and all that kind of stuff the second one would"
"12135080","12143680"," be where you can go to uh the website and actually put in any ticker you want and manipulate it"
"12143680","12153640"," any way that you want now um that can be very expensive we're talking like twenty"
"12153640","12160140"," thirty thousand dollars a month very expensive for me to take that on uh and then the last one the"
"12160140","12164780"," most expensive one is where you guys have the actual tool you can do what the fuck you want with"
"12164780","12169660"," it on your own you don't need me you don't need the website you could be anywhere you do it"
"12169660","12178560"," on trading view um so just it's harder than it seems i know it like maybe like oh this is"
"12178560","12186020"," so easy but a lot of it has to do with uh the cost to me of development and cost"
"12186020","12193400"," of running it for you to consume um and i can get i can lose my ass i've already you"
"12193400","12199560"," guys don't know a lot of this stuff i've already spent like i am up so i keep my bookkeeper"
"12199560","12204820"," and accountant i keep the books and what this costs for me to do for you guys and i am"
"12204820","12213840"," in the fucking hole like six figures at this point and uh i can't like if i launch this where"
"12213840","12219620"," it's at right now what could happen to me i don't talk about this publicly i will though what could"
"12219620","12228980"," happen to me is um if it doesn't get used if it fails uh to get um"
"12228980","12238520"," adoption i could uh go in the hole for multiple six figures and"
"12238520","12248480"," crash and burn and have to shut it all down and i am fucked and uh you guys don't"
"12248480","12255560"," have what we what you need so um has to be it's very precarious uh where we're at right now"
"12255560","12261920"," and so that's where it's at it's it's like very complicated it's i don't want to talk about all of"
"12261920","12269360"," it here but um it's a lot it's a lot of risk on my on my part for something that"
"12269360","12273020"," i don't need to do i do it because i love you guys i do because like fucking love retailers"
"12273020","12281500"," playing god damn simple my my macro view on you and i is that we're in a time right now"
"12281500","12291500"," where we're in a time right now where there's an opportunity for retailers to um become a force in"
"12291500","12297520"," the market more than they have been in a lot ever uh as a retailer now for that to happen"
"12298060","12302900"," i'm gonna get get it from every side i'm gonna get in trouble and you are and there's other people"
"12302900","12309940"," doing this too so there's a war right now going on where retailers have uh too much or not all"
"12309940","12316480"," retailers but some retailers have a have a it's it's all to do with the dissemination of"
"12316480","12324980"," information the ease of it today it also has to do with the uh computing uh being able to present"
"12324980","12334460"," very complex concepts and a very clean and simple uh or a very digestible format so if you're young"
"12334460","12340080"," okay i want to tell you if you're young back in there's more there's even more back today from this"
"12340080","12349080"," but back in the yahoo message boards everything that you see right now everything that you consume"
"12349080","12358700"," right now right that you're consuming you're young trader all this shit was uh was passed around by"
"12358700","12368380"," retailers uh in the early days of the internet on message boards then it turned into yahoo um"
"12368380","12376200"," but yahoo was the one that always rings a bell for me because guys would go on to yahoo and"
"12376200","12382140"," be like hey man this is this these are the gamma models for spx right and guess what they presented"
"12382140","12391700"," you with they presented you with the raw data no pivot tables no nothing so you go to like yahoo"
"12391700","12395580"," right like this fucking guy knows what he's talking about right he'd be like that guy over there is"
"12395580","12405340"," really smart right and like i'd be like you guys we're just in a back test we're all going up"
"12405340","12410560"," right like she show us and so what they would do is the guy would dump like an excel spreadsheet"
"12410560","12415480"," with a data dump for the day that's all you got you didn't get no pivot tables you didn't get"
"12415480","12421420"," no uh no equations you didn't get no black schools models you didn't get like um spitting out a"
"12421420","12426060"," fucking line for you on trading view that said this is the gamma flip line like when you see a"
"12426060","12429360"," line that says and i just showed you a line a few minutes ago i showed gamma flip we're written"
"12429360","12436000"," gamma flip right what'd that take me to do five seconds right dump in the numbers boom you get your"
"12436000","12441280"," line right well back in the day that's not what was going on you'd be like you have to do"
"12441280","12450320"," that shit yourself it's like right now retailer it's like it's like morris code uh if you're if you"
"12450320","12454780"," get any guys have a ham license out there it's not required for you get your ham license anymore"
"12454780","12463080"," knowing morris code it's pretty much very similar to that um you used to have to have to learn"
"12463080","12470800"," morris code pass your um your um i feel like the first license is called anymore but your ham i"
"12470800","12475820"," feel like the ham entry level license is anymore but whatever it's called you don't need to know"
"12475820","12479680"," that anymore right now you just go on the internet and someone's got it all for you big bam there"
"12479680","12486220"," you go calculations done now and a lot of this is two is two twofolded so the first one is"
"12486220","12493520"," that you have much easier dissemination of information that means like social media and the second"
"12493520","12501600"," part of it is uh you have uh functions of how to interpret data on a level that we've never"
"12501600","12510380"," seen and ease that we've never seen uh in this in this thanks in my view uh retailers are dangerous"
"12510380","12518540"," to our market and they're dangerous to banks 100% and i don't think it's been realized right now"
"12518540","12526740"," but i think it does get realized in the next decade i think you'll see the dangers of uh those"
"12526740","12536320"," dangers come to light and also uh you'll see likely uh FINRA and uh the SEC come down on retailers"
"12536320","12542180"," because of it you'll likely see especially new retailers in the market like the price to entry to"
"12542180","12546860"," get in will be um unless they have some other ways to beat you which probably a.i they have"
"12546860","12557230"," to beat you but it's that nice little role right there um"
"12557230","12563570"," older guys know all about this but young people have no idea how easy things are for you right or"
"12563570","12567290"," for what you're presented with in the in the speed of it like hey it's 9.30 we just got"
"12567290","12572210"," all the new data from the fucking asset from the uh cm uh from the uh chicago mercantile exchange"
"12572670","12577270"," we got all our new data for all the indexes let's fucking send them to the pivot table let's do"
"12577270","12584790"," a quick uh graph on it and now let's do a fucking uh a gamma curve model just like instantaneous"
"12584790","12594200"," yeah they do like range bond markets they do not want retailers taking over retailers"
"12594200","12603600"," truly are you might not know this but retailers are are dangerous retailers are very um"
"12603600","12613440"," uh retailers are not to be trusted so"
"12613440","12619060"," if you get retailers going crazy in the market they're all a one-body unison so that's the and"
"12619060","12628520"," right now retailers are manipulated right now uh use like this is used against retailers uh we're"
"12628520","12633520"," you know if if if i had a lot of money like you do you remember that time when they"
"12633520","12639320"," said the uh i'm not gonna say it remember when the p-e-n-t-a-g-o-n uh"
"12639320","12645600"," when there was a uh a b-o-m-b-s-c-a-r-e last summer in the market"
"12645600","12650840"," just dropped uh it was in the morning it was one day in the morning and it wasn't being just"
"12650840","12657340"," a rumor scam rumor that spread like wildfire like that kind of shit is real uh and so you can"
"12657340","12663020"," actually manipulate retailers today to like a herd run left and run right depending on what you"

"14882960","14887280"," nine dollars ten dollars thirteen dollars they went to fucking three hundred dollars i was trading"
"14887280","14895740"," that stuff so at that time i got out of that stuff and went back to the greater market and"
"14895740","14902180"," just made money in the greater market i wish i had stayed in that trade or those trades it was"
"14902180","14910220"," a more question of time right so it's like the bitcoin stuff had i just longed all that shit not"
"14910220","14916880"," looked at it for a year or two three years what a fucking made uh i probably would be i'd"
"14916880","14924380"," probably fucking money probably worth tens of millions of dollars that that much very high"
"14924380","14931780"," probability of that so uh so what i'm talking about xp i right now it could take some time it"
"14931780","14937920"," could take like two three months to even make that legit turn and then see that uh see that like"
"14937920","14944640"," hey this is awesome but i'm gonna warn you of something when i was showing you uh when i was"

"14975540","14980760"," up like those covid tickers um now we don't have covid to make it go to the moon over a"
"14980760","14986200"," year or two but over you know one three years something like that xp is very bullish here it's"

"15000380","15010260"," is good right now it's really good yeah yeah no no the black money thing i'm talking more"
"15010260","15018080"," about like uh like uh we lose the president or there's a terrorist attack in the united states or"
"15018080","15023520"," we've covid it's like something big like something that's not priced into the market that nobody"
"15023520","15029780"," knows about it's only when they don't know that uh it's like when they know about stuff most stuff"
"15029780","15035040"," they know about like all these banks put offices like there's offices in all these war countries"
"15035040","15042060"," they have offices there uh they're they're um if i worked for gs right now i'd be in uh ukraine"

"15064100","15070380"," to have somebody on the inside of moscow uh so that i would know before that was being discussed"
"15071960","15078820"," you should you should if you don't believe me there's many books written about this by um actual"
"15078820","15086780"," vetted insiders you i want you to know okay that if there's something that can negative negatively"
"15086780","15095900"," or positively impact the market in a huge way uh that these banks are just like the cia they have"
"15095900","15110110"," their own people of the same quality um bribing people to to know that's known so yeah"

"15114750","15121110"," thousands at risk uh so i was talking to joe donuts past week and we were discussing these layoffs"
"15121110","15128450"," and um we just we've just we've discussed this in the past uh we've had long conversations about"
"15128450","15138370"," this it's a good point to bring up uh and it's starting to happen right and"
"15138370","15146450"," we discussed this uh well back in uh two years ago we discussed this when you see i want to"
"15146450","15154750"," be clear to make sure that you still know this and remember this okay so that late late stage cycle"
"15154750","15160950"," of these businesses right these business cycles for these companies if i we were discussing the"
"15160950","15168670"," other day and we're trying to simplify it in our conversation and uh i'll simplify it for you so if"
"15168670","15178190"," i am going to uh it's a good good example so if i'm going to build um"
"15178190","15185690"," i'm going to make pencils get a pencil right here uh just sharpened it looks great it's a very"
"15185690","15189910"," sharp pencil i don't think it's going to come in there but you know very sharp pencil right here"
"15189910","15195410"," okay let's talk about layoffs i want to do a quick down and dirty what you need to know as"
"15195410","15199530"," a market purchase cash market which is all you need to know as a market participant the important"
"15199530","15208670"," thing about you and what you need to know about layoffs so i want to make 100 pencils and"
"15208670","15217970"," sell them for profit okay uh i don't have the money to make 100 pencils i'm fucking broke but i"
"15217970","15224950"," know that these pencils will make me some money so i approach uh do donut and i go hey Joe"
"15224950","15232730"," you got money man i'm broke now i know that i can make 100 pencils uh and they're going to"
"15232730","15242370"," make me i'm going to sell them for a dollar a piece but they only cost me i don't know"
"15242370","15249410"," 20 cents right i'm going to make a buck on make 80 cents a pencil fucking i'll split it with"
"15249410","15253670"," you you got the money i'll give you 60% i'll keep 40 okay Joe goes give you the money"
"15253670","15261110"," so i go and i make 100 pencils now the the paper or the uh proposal that i gave to"
"15261110","15270090"," Joe says something like uh nobody's ever had a pencil before people don't have pencils the first 30"
"15270090","15277750"," of these pencils i can probably get fucking uh a dollar fifty two dollars for it it cost me a"
"15277750","15284590"," ton of money in in uh hiring production workers and engineers and all this stuff and so it costs a"
"15284590","15290750"," lot of money but i can charge a lot of money and then uh so let's say i sell i"
"15290750","15297790"," don't know 30 of these pencils and a dollar 50 and pencils wear off other people are making them"
"15297790","15303410"," demand is lower i still command the market because i was the first guy to make them but you know"
"15303410","15312250"," everybody's got them and uh i now have to sell these pencils for a dollar right but so i sell"
"15312250","15317190"," a bunch of for a dollar now i've sold 60 pencils so the first group for dollar 50 dollar 30"
"15317190","15329050"," whatever dollar second group for a dollar right normally there's the kicker normally"
"15329050","15337610"," over 20 years in the future that's like two dollars seventy seven cents a gallon normally in our"
"15337610","15343610"," business cycle when we get to the end of that cycle the last 30 pencils that i have i can"
"15343610","15349830"," i usually have to sell those pencils for much less than the dollar 50 or the dollar i got a"
"15349830","15353170"," discount them i got to get rid of the supply and the stock that i have in hand and that's"
"15353170","15354710"," built into the pulls that I give Joe."
"15355250","15363650"," I'm like $2 or $1.50 then I get a dollar and then I get a 75 cents and that"
"15363650","15368590"," gives me or a 50 cents and that gives me the 30 gets 50 cents that gives me a dollar"
"15368590","15376590"," per average car or per average gross profit on this pencil right. "
"15376990","15377870"," That's how I get my dollar."
"15378930","15383350"," He's not afraid that I'm selling pencils at 50 cents because I already sold them at $1.50 right."
"15384390","15386250"," This is a business cycle right. "
"15386810","15392170"," Now there's some points here to be made even though I'm only selling it at 50 cents I don't need"
"15392170","15399890"," to make the dies for cutting this stuff and shaping it and I don't need I have perfected the"
"15399890","15402710"," manufacturing process so I can now begin to do what."
"15404070","15410650"," I'm not laying out new costs for new equipment and I don't need so many workers anymore right."
"15410770","15413970"," We're at an end of a business cycle nobody's offering any money anymore. "
"15414590","15420010"," They'd start laying people off and trimming right so I can spend the spend the last part of this"
"15420010","15426770"," cycle of selling pencils in laying motherfuckers off and maximizing all my profit."
"15429170","15434570"," There is a fucked up thing going on here not fucked up but something that doesn't happen too often"
"15434570","15437930"," only happens every decade two decades sometimes even three and four decades."
"15438850","15449290"," We just had a major major price increase across the board of all goods and services so"
"15449290","15455850"," even though we're in the end of this business cycle my pencil company and I had planned on dropping"
"15455850","15463550"," the price of these pencils to 50 cents instead of doing that guess what I've done I've been able to"
"15463550","15472810"," raise the price back to a dollar 50 and possibly even higher now that pencil that had a mean price"
"15472810","15479590"," of a dollar that mean price is now a dollar 50 and I can jack at the two dollars every"
"15479590","15484670"," now and again to go back to school or something whatever it is you're doing great pencil shortage"
"15484670","15493950"," or something that makes sense so my point here is that we have something that wasn't here"
"15493950","15503330"," in previous business cycles and that is inflation that has made a jump and is becoming embedded"
"15503330","15506150"," in our economy unexpectedly. "
"15508050","15517050"," So if you're seeing those layoffs out here right now right you should normally expect"
"15517050","15526350"," as those layoffs begin for these companies to possibly be their most profitable petting it in this"
"15526350","15535310"," late stage throwing in this big giant jump in inflation i.e. your pencils now cost a dollar fucking"
"15535310","15544950"," 50 or two dollars right you might expect even more profit in this late stage of this business"
"15544950","15554770"," cycle so if you're going to look at this quarter ERs and possibly even into next year"
"15556970","15562710"," and you see these mass layoffs happening in this late business cycle and let's say you say to"
"15562710","15567270"," yourself well they're laying all these people off so they're going to be doing great right but now"
"15567270","15571690"," we've got inflation to contend with these guys are not only going to be great with their layoffs"
"15571690","15576430"," but they get inflation and unexpectedly making more profits than they ever expected to make this"
"15576430","15586310"," late cycle it is probable that you're going to go into next year's ERs and see"
"15586310","15593030"," some wild ass numbers with all those layoffs and all that cutting back and expenditures on research"
"15593030","15600870"," and expenditures on new products just refining your best products so there's something that's not"
"15600870","15605950"," in our there's something that doesn't happen too often and another way to relate this would be to"
"15605950","15612630"," go back to i think i want to say 1992 or 96 but i think that was the last time"
"15612630","15618430"," when we saw but matter of fact the fact are around the country we're raising uh minimum wage right"
"15619070","15626170"," so you're seeing like the start of a new cycle with higher prices higher wages and this is"
"15626170","15633270"," something that doesn't happen too frequently so like if you're a hamburger producer right you only"
"15633270","15641730"," have a few moments every decade or two to raise your prices permanently that permanent price"
"15641730","15651410"," raising cycle is rare it's happening right fucking now the last time this happened was almost 30"
"15651410","15660530"," fucking years ago 30 so you're in the midst of this of this of this paradigm or this or this"
"15660530","15669410"," new greater cycle and you've got these companies that are able to capture before all these other"
"15669410","15674430"," costs come into play or other people are asking for producers are asking for this or this is asking"
"15674430","15679170"," for that whatever is happening in the background right there's that there's like goldilocks moment"
"15679170","15688430"," for me as a company where i already expected to cut i already expected to stop doing the uh the"
"15688430","15694050"," research i already expected to be selling the pencils much cheaper but lo and behold right now i"
"15694050","15698910"," can charge more than i ever expected so if i was the guy that was originally trying to plan all"
"15698910","15703390"," this out with joe and i give this prospectus to joe and i go hey this is what we're gonna"
"15703390","15709710"," make and we'll all both of us are like whoo we're rich and then i go back to joe right"
"15709710","15717960"," now and i go guess what joe we've been uh we've been given this opportunity where i don't have to"
"15717960","15724320"," charge a few cents for these pencils we didn't write that into our expectations uh five years ago"
"15724320","15729780"," or ten years ago when we started this that this was going to happen covid was going to happen"
"15729780","15734800"," embedded inflation was going to happen then i can raise the price of pencils right now is at the"
"15734800","15740360"," back end of a cycle for this pencil company and so now that i'm laying people off now i'm not"
"15740360","15744940"," doing any research and development i'm gonna squeeze this fucking thing and squeeze this pencil"
"15744940","15753680"," company every last fucking ounce of the end cycle profit out of it and so"
"15753680","15761780"," though we might see those profits go to the shit dumpster once they start researching and building"
"15761780","15768480"," or designing new dies and rehiring people to make a newfangled mechanical pencil our next our next"
"15768480","15775540"," pencil is gonna be mechanical it's not right now and so it might seem bearish to you but it could"
"15775540","15785480"," be delayed bearishness so when we're looking at um we're looking at this next quarter and possibly"
"15785480","15793440"," even longer um we could see ridiculous uh we could see ridiculous returns in some of these"
"15793440","15798440"," companies some really ridiculous ones especially with all these mass layoffs happening right now so"
"15798440","15806160"," it's bearish layoffs are bearish traditionally right now because this it might not be as bearish as"
"15806160","15814840"," it seems and uh it might be even more delayed and more mutated more really retarded like uh like"
"15814840","15821300"," retarding an injury or something it's like it's more like um it's more uh mutated or something like"
"15821300","15828080"," that abnormal not something in a normal business cycle you would see so um we were discussing that"
"15828080","15835940"," last uh last week on a phone call and i don't know um all right not that i"
"15835940","15845820"," don't mean it like i important at"
"15845820","15851680"," this moment they will be important uh but at this moment right now where they're starting just"
"15851680","15858620"," starting to lay off and they have way way higher prices than they ever expected and a lot of these"
"15858620","15865840"," companies are at the ass end of their business cycle that they they are probably seeing very much"
"15865840","15879490"," so unanticipated profits from their plans five years ago ten years ago the"
"15879490","15887450"," old pencil factory i don't know i had to make some shit up pencil factory i didn't think of the"
"15887450","15894690"," company mary's landscaping bob and the basement main street bob are you getting together we need to"
"15894690","15900830"," know it for this pencil company but it's very rare that that happens my point normally in a"
"15900830","15906730"," business cycle as it's coming to an end you're not seeing the the kind of inflation that we're"

"16065560","16073880"," idea here from previous fed presidents saying that we just do this stuff when we see the business"
"16073880","16079260"," cycle where it's at we we kind of like take the data see which where we are relates late business"
"16079260","16087360"," cycle we start that hiking and uh it lines up with already what's happening so it's more of like a"

"16235570","16241150"," raising rates you kind of know you know the covid the covid cycle is the one thing i think people"
"16241150","16248170"," missed that we got on this show was uh the two different cycles not being in line with each other"
"16248170","16253750"," the normal business cycle the covid business cycle two different things and they're trying to get"
"16253750","16259650"," them if you have like if you have like um a sine wave and you got one sine wave here"
"16259650","16266430"," that's the business cycle and then you had you know you then you had the uh you got the you"
"16266430","16272830"," know you got the you got the the dork and he's over into the door but then you got normal"
"16272830","16276210"," this is normal like just like this business cycle business then all of a sudden you got covid and"
"16276210","16283910"," it's like hold on hold on boss we're over here and you're like in Jerome and all those guys like"
"16283910","16289490"," ah shit we got to beat this thing up and get it back in line with this cycle over here"
"16289490","16296850"," and then we'll deal with this together again right slowly ween that out over time at least get them"
"16296850","16302870"," back on the same uh the same path where they were over here doing their own thing uh covid's very"
"16302870","16311310"," covid's are very weird um not weird it's just abnormal right and created uh created a whole nother"
"16311310","16320330"," fucking cycle of unexpectedness well the taxation thing is there"
"16320330","16330050"," so of that business cycle right that we're talking about with uh eventually you nor if normal have"
"16330050","16335230"," layoffs especially if that company's like peton going bankrupt uh you guys should already if you"
"16335230","16340450"," don't know about peton cycle um what's his name does a great job of explaining it though don't uh"
"16340450","16347590"," don't believe he's a he's horrible at timing shit but Ray Dalio has a great uh explainer on how to"
"16347590","16355750"," explain this stuff uh look up go to youtube look up Ray Dalio uh uh debt cycles and you should"
"16355750","16365670"," go to the first one right here a lot of retailers didn't want to believe"
"16365670","16370670"," that either you got two separate business cycles going on you got a covid fucking cycle and a"
"16370670","16376630"," normal business cycle and everything's become like weird not weird it's like mutated like two"
"16376630","16382990"," different heads and you got to squish two heads together again he he addressed this uh two cycles"
"16382990","16388990"," to go at the end of uh the presser and it was great to hear him say that because it's"
"16388990","16399759"," real that is a real thing it's really it's very rare that that happens very very rare very rare"
"16399759","16405200"," very rare where you give free money around people uh people likely did the right thing not the"
"16405200","16412240"," wrong thing they have more wherewithal than they would normally around this time companies too have"
"16412240","16416900"," more wherewithal can you talk about like zombie companies being out there and empty offices and all"
"16416900","16420900"," that kind of stuff they're not all empty some of them are some of these companies did do the right"
"16420900","16426340"," thing and they took their money and they fucking turned it into staying alive in a second chance a"
"16426340","16432380"," prime example of this would be maybe not a prime example i don't know if peton took cash but let"
"16432380","16442210"," me see if they did i'm going to assume that they did like peloton had a chance right they"
"16442210","16450029"," didn't they they fucking lot they they fucked it up but people were giving a second chance man that"
"16450029","16455990"," covid money companies corporations individuals they were giving a second chance and some people"
"16455990","16459590"," didn't even need the second chance so it was just like a freebie hey you want to pay for college"
"16459590","16464009"," loans here's all this money they got to put pay off some debt from that company that you have here"
"16464009","16473990"," you go here's some money and uh so it's like an abnormal um abnormal resuscitation of the"
"16473990","16480270"," market and what's even shocking about this is that uh in 2019 we were we were about ready to roll"
"16480270","16487029"," over we were about right the our last business cycle should have ended or let's just rephrase that"
"16487029","16492349"," we were coming to the end of a of what we think was a short-term debt cycle Ray Dalio"
"16492349","16496029"," has been calling for that this is the end of the long-term debt cycle he's been calling for that"
"16496029","16502630"," shit since 2000 but we know for sure that we were at the end of debt cycle in 2019 covid"
"16502630","16511369"," like just like blew that out of the water uh and mutated that whole normal business cycle uh"
"16511369","16518810"," yeah that that yeah i don't think it's a bad thing uh the money i know that why the money"
"16518810","16527050"," was given and stuff like that but it is what it is it is what it is well this looks"

"17901000","17911000"," um if i show that right"
"17911000","17923990"," there okay so if i um if i was guessing about twitter it's it's"
"17923990","17932570"," probably to an end that or like it has more to do with transforming itself into a new kind of"
"17932570","17936970"," company and hasn't like whatever we thought twitter like i think there's like so there's like a"
"17936970","17942510"," group twitter had like a group of people it's like twitter was its thing right and then you you"
"17942510","17952500"," have uh some people on twitter that were like hey um i've been silenced right this is"
"17952500","17960660"," typically uh people that from the right right and then um you see more middle the road people from"
"17960660","17963920"," left saying no we need to do this and do that this that's what twitter was rolling in becoming"
"17963920","17971660"," right jack dorsey was about and all that stuff um and then right now you're seeing uh people from"
"17971660","17977900"," the right saying this is better twitter's become better and uh people in the left are like twitter"
"17977900","17984000"," sucks now so you're like twitter sucks and twitter's better and you got these like like two warring"
"17984000","17990460"," factions and twitter and x and stuff but the most comical part of it it's not comical uh it's real"
"17990460","17996620"," world stuff that really impacts people but to me inside the the thing that i think about is that um"
"17996620","18004020"," what's happening with twitter likely doesn't there isn't about either side it's more of a vehicle"
"18004020","18012940"," to tear it down and turn it into um a for-profit vehicle town square social media do everything for"
"18012940","18020700"," everybody um at some point now do i think it's successful with that i don't fucking know i don't i"
"18020700","18026580"," don't know about that with twitter it's a weird thing i'll tell you this um do i think twitter uh"
"18026580","18033700"," comes back or is twitter ever like i think like i think twitter is dead um you don't think twitter"
"18033700","18038980"," ever comes back in what made it special which was uh i think they're going to try to save that"
"18039480","18045340"," or he's attempting to save that because the best part about twitter is the instantaneousness of"
"18045340","18050020"," news right you get news from twitter that you can't find like for all your like or dislike for"
"18050020","18055280"," twitter there's one major thing about it or if you were to if you were to distill twitter down to"
"18055280","18064900"," its um if you're to distill twitter down to its most special thing it's more than likely um the"
"18064900","18074640"," immediacy of information that you can't get anywhere else um now does that"
"18074640","18083660"," continue no it doesn't one of the big problems with it is you're not going to get some i don't"
"18083660","18089280"," know somebody in some some third world country that can't afford twitter to be picked up so you see"
"18089280","18092760"," what's going on maybe he thinks he's got algorithms to make sure that that person's voice gets"
"18092760","18097680"," heard if something crazy happens but man that might be true too but twitter as it what it was is"
"18097680","18105140"," probably dead is my point so if you're from the right or the left and you like what Jack Dorsey"
"18105140","18111700"," was doing or you you didn't it doesn't really matter twitter and what it is is more than likely"
"18111700","18117580"," fucking dead at a very early stage of a of some kind of a transformation into becoming a different"
"18117580","18122960"," kind of company now could some other company step in and replace what made twitter awesome for"
"18122960","18129960"," everybody or some people or one side or the other same with the fight is it's possible but it's"
"18129960","18133900"," possible or it's possible they could do enough to make you think or us think or other people think"
"18133900","18139840"," that about twitter but more than likely twitter and what it was and what it is likely dead forever"
"18139840","18148500"," i could eat those words if something changed there but i think from a pure"
"18148500","18156500"," for a pure like capitalist brutally capitalist perspective"
"18156500","18166260"," if i was looking at twitter um i would try to save"
"18166260","18173600"," just that one thing or find a way to make it seem like that thing was saved and that is"
"18173600","18179960"," the immediacy of twitter even if it's fake and i really don't care what republicans and democrats"
"18179960","18186640"," think um and if anything and you're all fighting with each other and it gets traction for me on"
"18186640","18192700"," twitter even better but the reality is twitter is probably uh i mean not just the name the namesake"
"18192700","18200220"," name debbie who had made it absolutely fucking unique is likely uh dead and there's probably uh"
"18200220","18207540"," some a human out there that said don't worry about it i can replicate that even if you're going to"
"18207540","18212440"," go do whatever you're going to do to transform this company um and some people think that's real"
"18212440","18219760"," some people think that that uh that hasn't died that that was salvaged that you could be some woman"
"18219760","18227320"," in a third world country that could get on a a drop bone with a quick twitter account and say"
"18227320","18232140"," hey there's a coup going on in my country right now and it boom goes to the goes to the"
"18232140","18237140"," top of it gets a million views and all that kind of stuff if i could tell you as an"
"18237140","18244000"," engineer hey i can either still still facilitate that to happen or keep that aspect good or alive"
"18244000","18248800"," and you can turn into whatever you want to turn into then behind a close like behind like the third"
"18248800","18257120"," door and the biggest c-suite there was that deal was probably made uh to monetize and you know grow"
"18257120","18265940"," it into whatever we can with gross disgustingness google thing it's going to become um okay so yeah"
"18265940","18271980"," you got the bear to bum with them okay it's a couple things here number one um if you're a"
"18271980","18276700"," bear if you're a seller right i want you to know that this is not a good place for the"
"18276700","18283680"," market to fucking close uh if it pops up and above on monday uh you're going to be chasing so"
"18283680","18290200"," we if you were here since this morning and we break over that that uh that uh that node right"

"18435640","18445600"," the 31st of december uh i'm going to expect trading to be kind of garbage uh next week or two"
