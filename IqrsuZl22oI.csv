"86920","87260"," morning."
"88360","92110"," All right, just a second here."
"92150","105040"," I've got a couple things I've got to do, got a"
"105040","106360"," sweet. "
"114370","119270"," We're got some premium kicking in it even with even with the selling on the open bell right now."
"120130","125910"," Some premium kicking in to call side of the world."
"128350","129630"," I'm going to look it out here. "
"129889","130530"," Hold on here."
"136490","146370"," Having some weirdness going"
"146370","146610"," on."
"150920","154440"," Come on, where's subscribers only button. "
"154800","158520"," I've got this still having some monitor issues here this morning."
"158520","167190"," There we go, subscribers."
"171130","171570"," Save. "
"173050","173970"," Squeezing, baby."
"176550","177610"," They're not even waiting."
"177810","179570"," They're buying calls right off the opening bell. "
"179810","181010"," They don't care right now."
"183850","185290"," Let me turn this over here."
"185430","186070"," You got the live stream. "
"187250","188590"," You can just see them right off the bell."
"188750","189250"," They don't even care."
"189990","194170"," Right away, I want you to pay attention above here to 40140. "
"195270","196270"," Watch that number."
"196470","199790"," There could be just a brief reversal up here."
"201510","202530"," 40140 or so. "
"203970","205510"," The yellow box is what's important."
"205870","207130"," I want you to pay attention to this."
"207270","208710"," This is S1 right here. "
"210850","212230"," For R1, excuse me."
"214590","216150"," They've got R2 up here."
"216550","222430"," Specifically, the yellow box right there is going to be a key for you to pay attention to at least"
"222430","223370"," right now. "
"223610","237990"," R1, they don't"
"237990","238430"," even wait."
"238570","239870"," They're just going to take it right up here."
"240050","242490"," They want you to remember this right off the bell this morning. "
"242590","243370"," Remember this, OK?"
"244110","245770"," You got R1 and then you got R2."
"246090","248590"," It's going to come back probably off here at some point."
"248590","252250"," It could come off R1, but I want you to right away. "
"252630","254930"," Just pay attention to this move and this move."
"255769","257589"," They're going to be looking for some consolidation."
"258050","259829"," This is the daily bar right here, OK?"
"260690","262690"," You've got the hourly right underneath you. "
"262770","265390"," It's not showing here in the chart, but there is an hourly right here."
"266050","270630"," So you'll get that push up and then you should get an explosive move over the daily."
"270910","272770"," Now, if we get over that daily, it's going to get violent. "
"272770","276390"," Violent to the upside today, OK?"
"276590","278810"," So just pay attention to this as we move forward."
"279670","281370"," They didn't even wait at this point."
"281870","286350"," I would still like to see us come back and close some of this bullshit down below some pivots. "
"286510","288550"," I don't know if that happens this morning."
"289530","290970"," So just remember R1."
"290970","291770"," Remember R2. "
"291810","293630"," This yellow box is critical here, OK?"
"294150","294890"," As we come above."
"295030","297110"," I can't even have any impose this on fin to it yet."
"297830","298610"," This stream. "
"300170","306170"," I need to I know I mean, I'm not figured, but I'm like I'm like the people aren't even waiting"
"306170","306610"," probably."
"307310","308830"," They're just like I'm long here."
"309350","313010"," I just made money off. "
"313130","313930"," I just took some money off."
"314070","315350"," I was long calls right on that Bell."
"317070","317910"," Fuck yeah. "
"319830","321870"," I was on 401 C's."
"322090","326990"," So I'm looking for a pullback on our one brief maybe and then a rip rip face ramp to this"
"326990","328870"," yellow yellow box above."
"329250","330110"," That's what I'm looking for. "
"330310","331770"," I just made I just made some quick money."
"334170","339250"," Fucking outstanding Thursday Friday is I guess I guess that's how the weeks are going right now."
"340050","355550"," Every Thursday Friday come get your money so you have a green week and then"
"355550","356370"," hold on here. "
"356490","365450"," I'm going to post this for the regular people that don't follow on that captain's alpha."
"367450","368110"," All right."
"368370","371710"," So what are we going to do in a day like today is like before like usual, right?"
"371850","374610"," We're going to come back over here snap ourselves some lines over here. "
"375410","377050"," And we're going to see how this goes."
"377330","379930"," You know, there's I was thinking about this last night and I'm like, you know what?"
"381090","382670"," We'll talk about this this morning."
"382670","387990"," I promised a good friend of the program that I would go over this for him today. "
"388030","390610"," And I got a bunch of stuff for you if you're a bull a bear."
"392850","395230"," What you're going to get not going to get right now."
"396250","399730"," That kind of stuff and it's going to be kind of a shitty. "
"400310","404330"," I think bears and bulls are kind of kind of getting it screwed over here."
"406030","411370"," In the coming weeks more to come on this and there's not a decision made if we're going up or"
"411370","412110"," down from there."
"412210","415870"," And even when we do go up or down from there, it's not going to be fruitful for either side. "
"415870","420090"," I don't think they're buying this right off the right right off the look at this boom."
"420350","420850"," They don't even care."
"421370","427070"," They're loading up right now on calls 400 C's 30,000 calls on those that they want to be fast"
"427070","427610"," on this. "
"428650","430550"," Let's just be just be conscious of this."
"430690","432190"," There could be a quick trap up here."
"432610","436270"," Roll back down test the one test the five and then you get to smash through above. "
"436550","440410"," I'll show this to you on the back end this morning."
"447620","448440"," I'm going to have to go."
"448520","450320"," I'm going to buy some buyback into these things. "
"450680","452940"," You know, I'm going to tell you, I'll be honest with you."
"453740","457380"," Today or tomorrow, if you buy the zero dates, I'm not going to, not you."
"457560","458140"," Don't do this. "
"460100","461880"," Don't do this, but I'm going to tell you this."
"462980","464120"," If it was me."
"464900","466180"," I'm almost betting. "
"467380","473940"," I'm almost betting that today or tomorrow, if you just buy the open with some zero dates or one"
"473940","474920"," dates or something."
"475720","476780"," And just hold them."
"477160","481340"," Just turn close your laptop and come back to 30 in the afternoon or something. "
"481540","486440"," They're going to be like 3000% printers or 1000% printers or something fucking stupid."
"488240","489180"," There you go."
"489260","491680"," You want to, you want at least an idea of a trend day?"
"492480","493660"," It's looking like one. "
"504590","506150"," No, not financial advice."
"509470","515950"," But if you want the days where I say, yeah, probably in a, we're probably in a fucking trend day"
"515950","516630"," that that's it."
"518990","519909"," You got it. "
"520929","522590"," Let me just buy them and close it."
"523110","525150"," I guess you have to pay attention to this one up here."
"528890","529590"," Good morning. "
"529730","530850"," Voice is already fucked up."
"531010","533950"," I need, I need like a look at this."
"533950","534650"," It's not even waiting. "
"535130","536350"," It's not, it's not even waiting."
"536890","538130"," It's not going to wait."
"539210","542330"," I'm going to show you one quick thing as we blast higher here. "
"543450","544570"," Ring that bell."
"544890","548630"," If anybody showed up here early this morning and caught that first trade."
"548910","552370"," And if you're catching the second trade, whoo hoo again. "
"553250","554970"," I need to show you something up here."
"555110","555230"," Okay."
"555730","556810"," You guys got to be quick. "
"558830","560190"," Got to be quick and fast."
"560430","560650"," Okay."
"562190","562650"," Here. "
"562870","563930"," Hold on here for a second here."
"564390","564690"," Okay."
"565130","565210"," So. "
"565950","568750"," I want you to pay attention to this right here."
"569930","574590"," Remember this hourly daily greens hourly yellows daily."
"575030","577850"," I want you to be very aware of this. "
"578430","580010"," We'll look at it in a one minute here."
"581770","583270"," You're very aware of this here."
"583410","583590"," Okay. "
"584390","585910"," What you're looking for here."
"587730","592370"," Is you're looking for the, for the white, the green and the red line to catch up."
"592670","596070"," To give them a momentum needed to break above. "
"596710","597450"," The daily."
"597670","597870"," Okay."
"598110","599090"," These three lines right here. "
"599650","601610"," You need price to stay above the one minute."
"601610","603790"," You need the debt, the hourly to come up."
"603790","604830"," So every hour today. "
"605210","607370"," And you need the five minute to catch up."
"607370","612370"," You need price to stay above to get enough momentum to break through."
"613110","618710"," Now when we break through this daily, if we break through this daily, they can be explosive and"
"618710","621390"," very, very emotional, right?"
"621710","623510"," So just be careful in here. "
"625110","626370"," Watch all of this."
"626490","627230"," This right here."
"627350","628950"," Watch this see this hourly coming down. "
"629210","631190"," I want you to see my cursor here."
"632350","634410"," The hourly is building to the upside."
"635210","635610"," Okay. "
"635610","639310"," Even if the five minute, the one minute is coming down a little bit here, right?"
"639510","641470"," The hourly is what you should be paying attention to."
"641590","643570"," I was wanting to pay attention to the daily down here."
"644010","645990"," And that daily is starting to get bullish. "
"646270","646450"," Okay."
"647170","649010"," Just a little tiny bit right here, right?"
"649430","653250"," Not quite bullish yet, but this hourly is key for bulls right here."
"653330","657910"," We want to see that come up here over the course of today and tomorrow, right?"
"658070","659670"," That's what you're looking for today and tomorrow. "
"660110","661650"," So we're like, I don't want to do zero dates cap."
"661650","662990"," I'm like, I get you."
"663470","667910"," But those one dates, you get all these cheap, cheap Tesla calls out there. "
"667910","669050"," You get all these bulls back."
"669410","671870"," You're like, I'm buying my Tesla weeklies on a Monday."
"672170","673270"," It makes so much money. "
"673630","677170"," I'm buying my Friday when the close and this whole entire week, they got wrecked."
"677570","678530"," Torn to shit."
"678950","681890"," We got expiries on tech coming out tomorrow, right?"
"682270","685410"," So you've got weeklies and monthlies and all these normal expiries and all of a sudden, they turn"
"685410","686870"," into zero dates on tomorrow. "
"686870","688010"," They're one dates right now."
"688010","688970"," You got Tesla."
"690230","692750"," That is, you got get burned, right?"
"692930","694310"," Tons and tons of Tesla calls. "
"694330","694970"," The US crew."
"695030","696590"," They're going to go all expire tomorrow, right?"
"696710","697570"," You got GME calls."
"697810","698710"," You got BBY calls. "
"698790","699470"," You got Apple calls."
"699510","700450"," You got Nvidia calls."
"700810","701050"," You got Nvidia calls. "
"701050","703730"," You know, Nvidia did pretty well, but there's a bunch of them out there that didn't."
"704230","705170"," And tons of them."
"705970","706330"," Okay. "
"706470","709870"," My point here is that there's tons of them that didn't do well this week."
"709890","711010"," And they're everywhere."
"711270","713470"," And they're going to sell them and they're going to be, that's in them closed. "
"713730","714610"," Then we're going to get screwed, right?"
"714790","715830"," I was bottom for 10 bucks."
"716030","716410"," Another worth."
"716410","717570"," 30 fucking cents. "
"717630","718590"," I'm never going to make money back."
"719850","722590"," And there's a high chance, a small, small, small chance in there."
"723090","726710"," But those 30 thing calls that went to, they got torched to zero or to a dollar. "
"727370","728290"," They're going to come up."
"730550","731370"," They're going to come up."
"732570","734510"," They're going to come up into Friday clothes. "
"735870","738150"," Today, tomorrow, it's, it's, it's."
"738830","739790"," Wait a minute here."
"739990","741110"," I'm gonna have to take another trade here. "
"749000","749720"," Oh, come on."
"749820","750380"," Give them to me."
"751060","752200"," Don't make me fucking chase. "
"755420","757080"," Don't make me fucking chase here."
"758600","760940"," I'm going to retest of the one minute right now."
"761000","766900"," I'm going to go back up and try, hopefully try to test this high and get a new high in"
"766900","767640"," the next 15 minutes. "
"767900","768420"," It's 943."
"768820","774040"," The bulls have 17 minutes to make a new high right now into the 10 o'clock hour."
"775060","777720"," We'll see if I can get a fill here to grab to come up higher. "
"777720","782560"," He says they're worried about coming for you winters and energy security issues in Europe are not"
"782560","782960"," resolved."
"783240","785160"," So it's going to start a week starting the show."
"787960","789720"," Here, give me one quick second here. "
"791020","793640"," And we know they're going to try to sell this down from above, right?"
"793820","796500"," They're going to try to rain down rain, rain on the parade above here."
"796960","799540"," And they're going to look for this big green arrow to come up America."
"799800","801120"," I'll tell you where it is right now. "
"801220","802580"," We'll move it as the day moves forward."
"804040","805680"," I'll tell you where the line is."
"805800","809840"," It's at $3.99.49. It's going to come up all day long. "
"810580","814080"," So $3.99.49 right here."
"814860","816580"," This stream is sponsored right here."
"818320","820540"," This line is going to keep coming up. "
"820720","821700"," This line all day long."
"822240","823860"," Right now it's with the five, the one minute."
"824120","825780"," It's going to keep coming up, coming up, coming up. "
"826260","828300"," And the red line's going to come up with it and the white line."
"828420","830500"," You're going to get this nice little cluster that's going to build in here."
"830500","835760"," And as long as this cluster holds, it's going to smash up into this 40145. "
"836740","841180"," If it gives it up down here, if we get, if we get price that goes below and holds below,"
"841460","842160"," it's bad, right?"
"842580","846940"," So the play is dead if we come down here, right?"
"847120","848200"," And you start to see these crossover."
"849240","851720"," These green box crossover and price gets under here."
"851860","852740"," The play is dead. "
"852860","856560"," But other than that, this is probably the best set of a bull scene all week long."
"857020","860020"," Only a bull scene, a bull scene, a better set up."
"860320","862280"," This whole entire week, not a single day. "
"862780","867780"," Well, the open yesterday coming into the open had a good set up, but they fucking started hedging"
"867780","869540"," right on the bell yesterday."
"869620","870920"," But today, not so much."
"871120","874780"," This is probably your best bull set up of the week right here, if you are a bull. "
"876200","877160"," Oh, look at that."
"877360","878220"," Making money right now."
"887000","888420"," Woo hoo, baby. "
"888800","889900"," Keep on pushing."
"892040","893340"," Keep on pushing."
"896560","898320"," Big three cluster right here. "
"898640","900060"," Monster three cluster right here."
"900220","901000"," One, two, three."
"901080","901980"," You got three triggers here. "
"902140","904180"," You've got, uh, what do you got?"
"904820","906460"," This is the hourly trigger right here."
"909250","914170"," You're all probably out there all like stone cold, sober, like what are you all on there?"
"914310","915690"," Like you're all quiet out there."
"915690","918030"," You're all like paying attention to your trades right now. "
"918710","919870"," You're all sweating bullets."
"920510","923590"," How many of you out there are going, I'll just wait for the, I'll just wait for it to go"
"923590","924650"," up, fucking 70 points."
"925130","927910"," And then I'll jump into some calls that you're selling to me cap. "
"934800","936400"," We're right there, early trigger."
"937440","941320"," We got the one, the five minute and the hourly trigger on the spy right now."
"941540","941980"," Three trigger cluster. "
"943300","948120"," Next trade and this trade is, for me at least, is going to be, so you got one trade, got"
"948120","951880"," two trades and I'm going to take another monster trade, hopefully right in here."
"951960","956560"," I'll play grab something down in here after we get rejection up here on the daily."
"956960","959780"," If we break above the daily, two things should happen. "
"962020","967040"," We should smash above and then we want the hourly to come up."
"967180","970260"," The one minute to come up, the five minutes come up and grab on."
"970260","972060"," They are in change trend for the bulls. "
"973340","976000"," Now trading 485 right now."
"976540","977940"," Show me some love in the stream."

"1109300","1112260"," Does that train a dollar point 37?"
"1113440","1115280"," BBB, why off the bell?"
"1115660","1117380"," Let's take a look at BBY next."
"1118620","1120540"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"1120740","1122960"," Extend declines to 10 basis points now. "
"1126240","1127380"," Oh, yeah."
"1127580","1130460"," BBY is coming into its hourly support right now."
"1130500","1132800"," One minute and five minute triggers. "
"1133220","1135300"," Three triggers on BBY."
"1135300","1142900"," It has to hold 131.34, looking for what above, huge above."
"1143900","1145060"," What is it looking for here?"
"1145320","1146920"," Oh, dude, is it really trying to go there?"
"1147020","1150120"," It's trying to go up to $1.92 right now in BBY. "
"1153070","1155690"," Price target, $1.90 on BBY."
"1155810","1161430"," You've got some resistance at $1.50, and then again at $1.64 or so."
"1162250","1166450"," Smashing into the hourly here at 401.35 right now. "
"1167830","1170070"," This is not the time for you to jump on this train."
"1170230","1171970"," It's the time for you to take money up here."
"1172170","1174290"," You remember the hourly trigger above here?"
"1174390","1176690"," It needs to cool down a little bit. "
"1178290","1179870"," Some of you guys are probably just like, fuck that."
"1179990","1183830"," I'm in zero dates and I ain't coming back until fucking end of the day."
"1183910","1184170"," I understand. "

"1204900","1208580"," You might get 401.51. You might be able to get that 51 update."
"1208720","1210420"," It might be another penny or two up here to grab. "
"1211460","1212320"," Look at that."
"1212540","1214000"," Reaching for the sky right now."
"1214260","1217300"," 401.46. Blasting, baby. "

"1258760","1260320"," I've got to put the exact number in there."
"1262680","1268540"," I don't think we get all the way down here to the hourly trigger, but I think I think we"
"1268540","1269300"," might not even get down."
"1269400","1270320"," I might just start blasting. "
"1271960","1273820"," We might get the one minute here."
"1274020","1274320"," We might."
"1274520","1276020"," We might catch the one minute. "
"1276580","1277440"," Just be patient."
"1278920","1280440"," Just be patient."
"1281260","1282320"," Be cool, man. "
"1283260","1284380"," Be super cool."

"1296140","1297980"," Got the one minute screaming up here right now."
"1298300","1300480"," Five minute hourly screaming up right now for some consolidation. "
"1301440","1302580"," This is all sexy in here."
"1302700","1303220"," I want you to know."
"1303520","1305440"," If you're like, cap, I don't want to time this. "
"1305660","1306040"," What about a weekly?"
"1307000","1308400"," What about a monthly for a day?"
"1311060","1313160"," This won't matter to you if it's a weekly or a monthly."
"1313300","1313500"," Will it?"
"1313620","1313680"," Maybe."
"1313940","1314220"," I don't know. "
"1314520","1315240"," It might not."
"1315820","1317480"," It doesn't make this thicker so you can see it."
"1317860","1318600"," Make it thick. "
"1319780","1320440"," There you go."
"1320560","1321120"," It's a nicer one."
"1322200","1322580"," It's nice. "
"1322760","1324240"," I want to see this one minute right here."
"1325120","1325480"," 449."
"1331180","1331900"," Maybe 451. "
"1332920","1335520"," Maybe slightly higher than where this is showing you right now."
"1338150","1338770"," What are we doing?"
"1339010","1339570"," What are we doing?"
"1339750","1340110"," BBY."
"1340270","1341910"," It looks like it's power pumping right now. "
"1342030","1342690"," It doesn't end the background."
"1345950","1346350"," BBY."
"1346470","1346790"," Come back. "
"1346990","1347450"," Check it's back."
"1347610","1348410"," Support as well."
"1349410","1350790"," How are you guys all doing out there?"
"1351270","1352650"," I got some weird echo going on today. "
"1352650","1353110"," I don't know why."
"1364620","1365740"," Good morning, everybody."
"1365820","1367500"," Thanks for joining us this morning. "
"1368080","1369360"," Everybody's ready to make some money today."
"1369520","1371260"," I'm assuming that at least two of them."
"1371300","1372380"," I made two trips. "
"1372480","1373940"," I made both of these trips right here."
"1374260","1375860"," I'm waiting for this to cool off a little bit."
"1376140","1377180"," I'm waiting this to calm down. "
"1378920","1382600"," We got 63,000 calls on 400C."
"1383600","1385900"," 63,000 calls on 401C."
"1387040","1389380"," How am I bowing these 402s right now?"
"1389800","1392800"," Maybe they can jump on the train if it comes down a little bit. "
"1393320","1395240"," I think they can jump on the 401 train or something."
"1396260","1398140"," They're a little pricey a dollar right now."
"1398780","1399560"," We're in the money calls. "
"1400800","1402140"," We want them to come down just slightly."
"1402500","1403220"," Just a little tiny bit."
"1403960","1404400"," Come on, man. "
"1404560","1405060"," Don't leave me behind."
"1406640","1407980"," One minute's coming up right now."
"1408140","1409160"," This is a trend change. "
"1409420","1410120"," We talked about this yesterday."
"1410120","1414280"," If we get above this 40150, this will be a trend change for the bulls."
"1414560","1415920"," It'll be an explosive move higher. "
"1420180","1423040"," A bunch of calls just came off the market at 400."
"1424340","1427460"," So it looks like they're just holding 401s at this point."
"1430720","1431560"," Come on now. "
"1432080","1435280"," Dude, I can't stand fucking sometimes tasty."
"1436080","1439760"," They're doing these alerts where they mess with my buying powers."
"1442960","1444340"," Sitting over here looking at. "
"1444340","1446640"," I'm looking at a 402s."
"1446740","1447840"," They're 57 cents."
"1448140","1449700"," 401s are 98 cents. "
"1450160","1452340"," So five minutes away now to the top of the hour."
"1452560","1455400"," Would you expect comments from Fed Vice Chair for supervision bar?"
"1455860","1459280"," He needs to like delay his speed tomorrow."
"1459680","1463180"," As a reminder, text is expected at the top of the hour. "
"1463440","1464780"," It'll also be a Q&A from the moderator."
"1465500","1467540"," And we have got the live video for this speech on the feed as well."
"1467780","1468220"," Gross. "
"1471180","1472660"," We got to wait for the sped speaker."
"1475820","1482680"," Give it five seconds here."
"1488200","1488920"," Five seconds. "
"1489060","1489740"," You don't want to be trapped here."
"1489860","1490340"," Just hang tight."
"1495990","1496910"," Good morning, everybody. "

"1507410","1509050"," There's a guy and you are a girl."
"1509190","1510590"," I don't know if it's a guy or a girl actually. "
"1510590","1513710"," But I haven't asked what they want to be called."
"1514870","1516550"," But LC channel."
"1516830","1517570"," LC's channel. "
"1517850","1524390"," If any of you are looking for someone to hang out with in our community, other in Discord or"
"1524390","1525090"," Twitter or something."
"1526470","1528690"," Can you guys reach out to LC's channel?"
"1529270","1532490"," He or she has started their trading journey about a year ago."
"1534950","1537710"," And probably looking to hang out and say what's up. "
"1537710","1542050"," So it'll cool really nice conversation with them last night."
"1542550","1547310"," And I don't know if you guys can reach out to him or something."

"1549430","1551390"," Maybe I'll see you put up your Twitter handle or something."
"1552150","1553770"," People can find you on fin to it."
"1566730","1567810"," I always like that. "
"1567970","1571670"," Like somebody that can persevere a year as a new investor or trader."
"1572570","1573170"," I was there."
"1573610","1574290"," I remember it. "
"1574290","1581430"," And I was always like either like I think inside I wanted to be a part of a community."
"1581710","1583530"," And I think we probably already is part of other communities."
"1584070","1587770"," But I remember when I was like a year maybe a year trader, I always wanted to be like, I"
"1587770","1589350"," mean, I want to be a part of a community or something. "
"1590250","1591110"," And I would never ask."
"1591450","1593350"," And so he may be here."
"1593430","1595490"," He is part of a community, but or she. "
"1597910","1601550"," But you know, like no one ever, no one ever like said hi to me."
"1601550","1606190"," And I want to be like, oh, I want that or, you know, anyways, I don't know, at least for"
"1606190","1606350"," me."
"1612550","1613670"," I'm flat right now. "
"1613730","1614270"," I'm not in anything."
"1615390","1617050"," But I am looking to jump on this."
"1617430","1619150"," And I'm just going to give it a second here and wait for this. "
"1620630","1623570"," Wait for this bar speaker to speak."
"1634320","1635140"," Let me see here."
"1635280","1636480"," Let me look at you. "
"1637200","1638060"," If you want to place."
"1640480","1641320"," 400 145."
"1642380","1643100"," So right here. "
"1643860","1645360"," We want to get above this."
"1647500","1649440"," So if you want safety in a trade."
"1650460","1652320"," If you want safety in a trade, it's. "
"1654200","1658140"," Or if I want safety in a trade, it's probably price being above."
"1658920","1661020"," And this one minute coming up here."
"1662280","1664400"," That's a safer trade right there. "
"1665120","1665560"," Okay."
"1665720","1668100"," So you can see this on your own screen, wherever you're watching."
"1669160","1672400"," The safer and that's actually the safer trade here is. "
"1673160","1675000"," The safer trade here is price."
"1675780","1677180"," Let me draw this out."
"1678940","1679860"," Let me draw this out. "
"1680000","1681160"," So it's a better view."
"1681440","1681540"," Okay."
"1682600","1683580"," So this is the white line. "
"1687610","1689430"," One minute now to the top of the air."
"1689690","1691590"," We were expecting the text release for Feds bar."
"1691810","1692970"," So again, it's under one minutes time now. "
"1693650","1695090"," This is price right here."
"1695990","1697490"," Looking for price to come up."
"1698670","1699950"," And actually retest. "
"1701230","1702570"," And this right here."
"1703290","1706530"," Is usually the best part of the trade right here."
"1707530","1709270"," This is very dangerous in here. "
"1709450","1711390"," You can get we can we can do is roll over."
"1711530","1711750"," Let's see."
"1711810","1713090"," Let's see it by like 60 cents. "
"1713150","1714730"," This is sponsored by to the tick."
"1715210","1715970"," Get free data."
"1716030","1720910"," We roll down here and they come 30 cents by signing up to the tick. "
"1721510","1726170"," Another way to get rid of this is do like 60 cents calls and then do a stop at 58"
"1726170","1727730"," cents or even 55 cents."
"1728550","1733710"," Do it nine or 10 times until it starts going up like you get you like take like little hits"
"1733710","1734810"," three four five times."
"1735230","1741790"," Then you get that banger word word actually prints for you like 100 200 300%. "
"1741790","1751700"," So there's different methods you could just grab like a weekly"
"1751700","1752860"," for next week."
"1752860","1754960"," And the pennies are going to matter to you."
"1754960","1759460"," Potential for transformative effect, but needs appropriate guardrails. "
"1759780","1763480"," As recent experience makes it clear the crypto could pose risks to banks."
"1763720","1765940"," Although exposure is limited so far."
"1767820","1773080"," Yeah, I was reading about Silvergate further this morning going down the Silvergate whole we talked"
"1773080","1773960"," about last week. "
"1774920","1777320"," They do make money as a market maker, right?"
"1777760","1780660"," So, but does it poison banking."
"1782000","1787960"," The Fed's part also does say the Fed is creating a team of experts to study crypto innovation and"
"1787960","1791680"," that the Fed would view it as unsafe for banks to directly own crypto assets."
"1792360","1797080"," The banks expected to notify the Fed before engaging with crypto as well and some new financial"
"1797080","1801900"," technologies could speed up payment systems and the benefits of crypto innovation only possible"
"1801900","1803600"," with the appropriate guardrails. "
"1803680","1805540"," I'm over here doing stink bids on spy."
"1806480","1809720"," I'm like, I'll buy 300 right now."
"1810240","1811260"," Then I'm like, nope. "
"1814980","1815440"," Nope."
"1816180","1816180"," Nope."
"1816500","1816960"," Nope. "
"1820770","1823630"," Trying to sell me spy zero dates for an extra three cents."
"1823870","1824690"," I'm like, get out of my face."
"1850800","1854540"," Vic's bleeding off down to 1897 right now. "
"1859810","1862030"," Man, I want to buy this so bad and I haven't yet."
"1862590","1865070"," I should just buy it and just hold it all day long."
"1870180","1871760"," It's about to rip face right here. "
"1871880","1872880"," It's getting ready."
"1880640","1884860"," I'm like, do I just buy seven then just fucking DCH so just so I don't miss it."
"1887900","1891980"," One minute keeps coming out with a five and it keeps one of the five is now up here. "
"1893420","1895300"," Just creeping up right now in the background."
"1924720","1925740"," I'm about to enter."
"1925960","1928040"," I'm about a minute or two away from entering here. "
"1929040","1929680"," I'm close."
"1940070","1941070"," I'm chasing now."
"1944930","1947370"," I'm going to delete it and try to get back in here in a second. "
"1948650","1950210"," It's not going to fill for me."
"1952730","1953430"," Now I'm chasing."
"1953670","1954250"," I'm chasing now. "
"1954930","1955870"," I didn't make that trade."
"1956050","1956350"," I missed it."
"1960830","1962430"," I missed jumping on board there. "
"1963070","1963510"," I tried."
"1964270","1966590"," I tried grabbing it briefly there and I missed it."
"1967110","1967310"," Fuck. "
"1988160","1990060"," I mean, I totally missed that trade."
"1994770","1996570"," We're about to smash through right now."
"1997650","2000290"," I think trying to smash through right now. "
"2004490","2008810"," My only hope here is to just something like this."
"2009730","2011190"," That's my only hope to get into that trade."
"2016650","2019030"," That's my only hope right there as I come back down. "
"2020870","2022510"," Just give me liquidity break, bro."
"2023130","2024730"," It's like one fast one straight down."
"2036010","2037430"," Yeah, Winky, I haven't had a chance. "
"2037710","2038690"," I saw your text message."
"2038930","2040130"," I haven't had a chance to look at it very yet."
"2040250","2040930"," Do you want to take a look at it?"
"2047060","2048520"," Oh, look at Bert. "
"2057699","2060159"," Bert is almost there, Winky."
"2061219","2061320"," Almost."
"2064800","2066060"," Almost there, bro. "
"2066520","2070060"," Feds boss says the Fed is forming a team to study crypto innovation."
"2071260","2073639"," Let me bring up Bert for you, Winky."
"2076900","2078320"," It's almost there, bro. "
"2078620","2079280"," It's like close."
"2082620","2087320"," This looks like the bottom, but you see how we didn't have the hourly."
"2089120","2093920"," But over here, the hourly is kind of bottoming down here, so it's close to turning around. "
"2094739","2097580"," Five minutes turning around, one minute turning around on vert."
"2098360","2099320"," It's trade in 1808."
"2101680","2102760"," It's close, Winky. "
"2103320","2104060"," It's almost there, man."
"2104620","2108760"," Oh, yeah, you don't want to see this though, do you?"
"2111240","2115660"," You don't want to see that happen down there, down to 14 or 16."
"2117520","2121040"," Winky, the hourly is still coming down and the daily is still coming down. "
"2122920","2127860"," In safety, you're looking to at least capture like 1834 at the moment."
"2128460","2132060"," Let this just let it do its thing, man."
"2132540","2133800"," It's a trade in 1808. "
"2135260","2136960"," You want it to trade above and hold."
"2137640","2142000"," It's probably going to need some time to get back up there and consolidate, even then 1915."
"2142920","2144940"," Be careful right now, on vert, brother. "
"2155300","2157220"," I should put some alerts on vert."
"2158840","2159880"," It's close, Winky."
"2179780","2182620"," I'm trying to come up and test this one minute again now. "
"2183080","2185120"," This is the second attempt on the one minute."
"2185420","2189240"," If it can't break through all by itself, the one minute can't break through all by itself."
"2189260","2190300"," It's going to come back down. "
"2191040","2196260"," It'll end up coming back down over here and looking for the support that it needs to make that move"
"2196260","2196620"," higher."
"2197500","2200260"," Just be careful in here because you don't have the one in the five."
"2200400","2201980"," You don't have the one in the five on your side. "
"2202000","2203360"," You don't have the hourly on your side."
"2203800","2205180"," Just be careful over here."
"2205820","2210400"," Could see us come back down and look to build some support to actually break through. "
"2210560","2217540"," It could look something like this and then this kind of shit and then it is going blasting right"
"2217540","2218120"," off up here."
"2218240","2227270"," Just be careful over here, right down in here."
"2237320","2239320"," Needs momentum to help it take it above. "
"2261650","2264150"," It's so short it hurts."
"2280360","2281610"," Let's see here where they are."
"2281890","2283470"," $399.65 now. "
"2285210","2294070"," $399.65. Save right there."
"2295430","2296610"," $399.65 down there."
"2300830","2303490"," $399.65 right there. "
"2314260","2316920"," We have to look for March 10th."
"2318780","2321240"," Now they're already juicing March 10th March 10th, huh?"
"2322120","2327520"," Two bucks for a call on March 10th for a zero date or a one date right now."
"2327620","2328040"," It's two bucks. "
"2342940","2343860"," I'm all in, baby."
"2348670","2349250"," 10, 10."
"2349490","2351610"," Now five more minutes for bulls. "
"2352330","2354210"," Five more minutes for bulls to get a new high."
"2355010","2358430"," They want to get a new high in the next five minutes, believe it or not, right up here."
"2358750","2362110"," Even if it's just a little bit of a new high, a little tiny bit, they want to get one"
"2362110","2362510"," new high. "
"2378820","2381020"," 15 minutes for bulls or five minutes for bulls."
"2382700","2384360"," Come back down, jump on the five minutes."
"2404610","2405850"," Come on down here. "
"2405950","2407270"," I should put the screen line right here."
"2409710","2410950"," Right there, baby."
"2411850","2413310"," Right down there, baby. "
"2414190","2419190"," Send them right down here to me so I can get them dirt cheap or at least something like this."
"2420430","2421750"," Then something like that either way."
"2423030","2425730"," That'd be a nice place too for call spreads down in here. "
"2426470","2427310"," Friday call spreads."
"2427850","2430110"," Oh, yeah."
"2430210","2430690"," Get down there. "
"2430770","2431770"," Some of your fucking calls."
"2437020","2437900"," Yeah, that's right."
"2438220","2438600"," Bleed them out. "
"2442220","2443040"," Yeah, that's right."
"2443220","2443620"," Bleed them out."
"2443900","2444300"," A little bit more. "
"2444580","2445680"," Give me more juice down there."
"2445780","2446140"," A little bit more."
"2448120","2449040"," Stop them out. "
"2449720","2451360"," Stop them out down there."
"2452780","2462580"," I started a position on"
"2462580","2464040"," four zero two."
"2464940","2465920"," Very small position. "
"2466200","2468020"," I'm going to keep adding to it as we head down here."
"2468020","2470400"," I'm going to try to grab some right down in here."
"2471840","2473980"," Right in here, I'm going to try to grab some calls. "
"2475340","2476980"," Watch this consolidation move."
"2478200","2479440"," So I am long right now."
"2480360","2481560"," Not by much, just a little bit. "
"2482620","2483400"," I want to miss it."
"2483620","2484260"," There's so much here."
"2484440","2489000"," There's so much momentum right here that I don't want to miss this trade right here. "
"2491640","2496500"," Got your nice little hourly trigger right here."
"2497060","2503320"," We've got on the hourly we've got we've got 18 minutes left on the hourly."
"2504340","2506520"," Come back to test that five minute right now. "
"2524080","2525260"," Diamond hands, baby."
"2526340","2527040"," Diamond hands."
"2529600","2533100"," Actually, not just diamond hands, but buy that fucking hour. "
"2533100","2549760"," Oh, yeah,"
"2549960","2550040"," dude."
"2550120","2552060"," Spy is bullish as fuck right now."
"2559100","2560780"," Touch that hourly for me. "
"2572280","2573420"," Come on down there."
"2573500","2574400"," Touch that hour for me."
"2587930","2588950"," Come on now. "
"2600340","2601440"," Come on now."
"2624490","2626210"," I feel so good buying right here."
"2626250","2626910"," It's like I'm funny. "
"2626970","2629430"," A little bit of ad right here."
"2629530","2631770"," If we can get just if we can get this one little red bar down here."
"2631770","2636010"," They're like oneness and oneness right here and we happy man. "
"2637230","2638570"," Happy, happy, happy man."
"2655860","2656640"," Come on down."
"2666740","2670120"," Now 10, 15, 15 minutes left for bulls. "
"2703650","2706290"," Green right now from flat right now."
"2706310","2773280"," I should say just"
"2779580","2781700"," wait and see if I can grab this hourly trigger here."
"2781860","2791330"," Hold on added at 34"
"2791330","2792270"," cents. "
"2794870","2795910"," Oh, wait a minute."
"2796290","2797130"," Can I get one more here?"
"2797130","2806590"," Oh, we got a switching from call side to the put side here 400 P's for $1.37. Two more"
"2806590","2806850"," here."
"2808270","2808950"," Hold on. "
"2809150","2809990"," Don't leave behind here."
"2812390","2814190"," Grab some at 24 cents."
"2832640","2834960"," Take my portfolio and see if I'm green or red. "
"2836420","2837520"," I'm almost green."
"2840000","2844900"," Look into the fair and greed index showing 47 out of 100 vision to get it's neutral and the crypto"
"2844900","2847940"," fair and green for out of 100 indicating fair."
"2857970","2860970"," They're probably going to stay above like 29 cents or something like that. "
"2863030","2864510"," Now trading 30 cents."
"2871880","2876100"," Got a small bear plane coming up here, but I trust this hourly so far right now."
"2880200","2882160"," As long as this hourly holds, I'm going to be good. "
"2882600","2886400"," If we do break below the hourly or reject off the hourly, I'll close them out."
"2887700","2896640"," Switch to the put side 10, 19 right now."
"2898080","2899320"," 11 minutes left for the bulls. "
"2904560","2905960"," Now trading 31 cents."
"2931580","2932640"," Bulls have to break above."
"2933200","2937040"," The next 11 minutes bulls have to break above this five minute and this one minute. "
"2937140","2938420"," If they can't do it, it'll reverse."
"2939320","2940520"," I'll jump on the put side."
"2952490","2953550"," Come on, hourly. "
"2953870","2955230"," Hold it together."
"2957570","2959910"," 30 minutes time now at the bottom of the hour."
"2960150","2962630"," Do you get the release of the weekly EIA natural gas change?"
"2963290","2966150"," 4 cost minus 83 BCF on the prior minus 81. "
"2966470","2968450"," 31 cents right now, 32 cents."
"2972190","2973170"," Sweating bullets here."
"2981070","2982110"," 33 cents. "
"2992080","2995300"," Got my finger on the cell button just in case this reverses on me."
"2996020","2996980"," 34 cents."
"2998540","3001340"," Come on bulls, put it out of your asses. "
"3003840","3006280"," They're trying to reverse this so hard right now."
"3006760","3007840"," They're trying their best."
"3008920","3011400"," These bears want nothing more than reverse this shit right here. "
"3012760","3016300"," These bears are like sending this to the depths of hell."
"3018320","3020120"," I'm trading 33 cents right now."
"3021160","3022140"," 31 cents. "
"3022660","3023480"," They're trying, man."
"3024300","3030200"," They want nothing less than the send this down to right down here, 39754."
"3037680","3038540"," 31 cents. "
"3038740","3040720"," I'm only up like two pennies right now, three pennies."
"3041840","3043980"," I got a nine minutes left."
"3043980","3044200"," 31 cents left. "
"3055130","3057090"," This hourly must hold for the bulls."
"3057310","3060230"," If the bulls can't hold the hourly, it's not good."
"3060990","3062670"," This is where the bears are above here. "
"3062850","3065870"," So the bears are they don't want to they don't want to change trend over here."
"3065990","3067010"," I'm going to show you this right now."
"3067010","3070710"," You got the daily trend here and you get the hourly trend right here. "
"3070830","3075230"," So if the bulls hold this hourly, the hourly is going to push up above here."
"3076110","3077290"," And then break above."
"3077290","3082050"," And change trend bullish for tomorrow. "
"3082350","3084910"," So you know that the sellers don't want us going above there, right?"
"3085450","3086950"," That's their last stand, by the way."
"3087110","3092230"," Someone was asking last night, are the bears still way up high?"
"3092450","3092690"," They're not."
"3092990","3093650"," They're right here. "
"3094510","3097150"," This is their last this is their last stand right here."
"3097310","3104250"," If we break above this hourly, it's going to fucking squeeze to the highs that we where we sold off"
"3104250","3104470"," to."
"3104530","3110990"," So if you're like the scene of the crime, for the bulls is above just right here. "
"3111230","3114630"," It's not above like another 40, 60, 70 handles."
"3115530","3120410"," The scene of the crime is like, this is the last stand for the bears right here."
"3121170","3121990"," This is all they got. "
"3122910","3124310"," They only have this."
"3124550","3128030"," The moment that you hold and break above here, it's going to go."
"3128230","3130150"," It's going to go like 70 handles straight up. "
"3130190","3133030"," Maybe not 70 like 30 to 70 handles straight up."
"3137420","3139160"," So this is kind of their place, right?"
"3139160","3140740"," They don't have anything above there."
"3140900","3143400"," This is the last place for the bears right here. "
"3144360","3145180"," This is where they are."
"3145340","3145880"," They're nowhere else."
"3145980","3146780"," They're nowhere else above. "
"3147200","3148360"," They're just right here."
"3156280","3159300"," You know, the moment you break above there, it's over."
"3159620","3160760"," It's like it's like 70. "
"3160940","3161620"," I don't know if it's 70."
"3161760","3163000"," We'll take a look at it here in just a minute."
"3163080","3163780"," I'm in a I'm in a trades. "
"3164020","3167900"," I don't want to look at it, but I will here in just a minute."
"3170320","3171520"," I'll show you where they are."
"3174590","3176050"," And that's all where they are. "
"3176230","3177470"," They are nowhere above there."
"3177470","3179290"," As a matter of fact, from there, we go."
"3180510","3182930"," I'll give you exactly where we go from there. "
"3184230","3188510"," Yeah, dude, we go to like, we go to like 410 or something."
"3189690","3190410"," 406 first."
"3191750","3192970"," And then like 410 or 412. "
"3193890","3195310"," That's how low they are right now."
"3195470","3196370"," They're like right here."
"3198270","3199250"," They're nowhere else. "
"3199410","3200650"," This is where they tee off right here."
"3206520","3209680"," So we're going to talk a lot or I was asked this morning in a text message."
"3210160","3217440"," Tuesday, one that once someone asked me yesterday about you know, will the bears defend all the way"
"3217440","3218680"," up to 412 and they won't?"
"3218780","3220240"," They'll just defend this line right here. "
"3221900","3227700"," And not only that, but the moment you break above and hold this, you'll start, we'll start"
"3227700","3228340"," squeezing crazy."
"3229120","3233860"," And the crazy part is they're waiting for, they're waiting for the J-POW meeting to believe it or"
"3233860","3233880"," not."
"3233980","3234720"," It's a J-POW meeting. "
"3235660","3236800"," They're going to tell you that."
"3236920","3242180"," So the next two, three days, they're going to tell you that however the numbers come out in the"
"3242180","3248260"," economic news, they're going to try to predict that that's the moment of the crash and all that"
"3248260","3248500"," stuff."
"3248680","3253280"," But the reality is they wanted to hear J-POW in that meeting do an emergency rate hike. "
"3253480","3257300"," That was the trigger right there for the market to crash was they sent it hearing."
"3257960","3265100"," So they'll grasp for straws in these numbers that are coming out today, this morning, then tomorrow"
"3265780","3268900"," and on Monday, they're going to grasp for straws heading into the meeting."
"3269060","3274200"," The truth here is that one of the key things J-POW said was we're not going to make a"
"3274200","3275100"," decision until the meeting. "
"3275600","3282100"," So with that being said, you're talking about a bank trying to crash the stock market into the Fed"
"3282100","3282460"," meeting."
"3283240","3285320"," Probably shouldn't be trying to do that in the market."
"3285780","3287620"," Probably not the best thing to be doing. "
"3288480","3292160"," So he's basically telling banks they have to wait until the Fed, the FOMC meeting."
"3294160","3298460"," For a decision from him as to what's going to happen, right?"
"3298680","3303080"," Now he's not, Fed Chair Powell is not waiting for the numbers to come out."
"3303940","3307860"," Even though in the Senate hearing, he's like, you know, we're waiting, I'm waiting for these three"
"3307860","3312340"," numbers to come out for the Fed meeting. "
"3312540","3316020"," So here in this hourly trigger, I got to make sure we don't make this cross down below here."
"3316780","3321600"," If we make this cross, if we get this five in one minute that crossed over this, let me see"
"3321600","3321720"," it."
"3321860","3325820"," If you get this cross over here, I'm going to have to cut myself loose in here because it can"
"3325820","3328580"," be very dangerous for me to be in a position here. "
"3329760","3331760"," So on the FOMC meeting, right?"
"3332160","3334440"," Not the FOMC, but the Senate meeting with J-POW."
"3335220","3340640"," One of the key things he said was, well, the funny things he said was I'm waiting for the data"
"3340640","3341720"," to come out the next few days."
"3341780","3344500"," He's not fucking waiting for any data to come out these few days. "
"3345260","3346200"," He's got the data."
"3346620","3347000"," What do you think?"
"3347160","3354500"," Do you think he sits in like an office and gets a dot matrix, like, gets a dot matrix printout?"
"3355120","3361580"," And maybe he does make his decisions off of these numbers that he supposedly doesn't have right"
"3361580","3361860"," now."
"3363160","3365400"," But he's basically telling the market, you have to wait. "
"3365800","3370980"," You have to wait until the FOMC meeting for me to make a decision on what we're doing."
"3371660","3373560"," He's not going to tell you in the Senate hearing."
"3374080","3376640"," He didn't do an emergency rate hike in this Senate hearing. "
"3377520","3378700"," And I apologize."
"3379380","3383820"," He might not be the one doing all the scientific stuff, but he's got people that do that for him."
"3383820","3384600"," So just under three minutes. "
"3384600","3385960"," They're already looking for..."
"3385960","3387540"," If you get the EIA, not through gas change."
"3388000","3390660"," Hold on a second here, probably got to cut these loose here a second."
"3390740","3391660"," That's a minus 81, please Jeff. "
"3392120","3395060"," So I'm going to keep my hand on the trigger here to get out of this."
"3395380","3400480"," So the idea here is he's not waiting for three numbers to come out that he's going to put on"
"3400480","3406480"," a trading view chart and then decide, fuck it, we're doing 100 BPS on the 22nd of March."
"3406800","3407400"," That's not happening. "
"3407700","3409840"," I apologize to you if you think that's what's happening."
"3410540","3411720"," Here he has that data."
"3411960","3413940"," He has got people that are telling him what he has to do. "
"3414360","3419520"," And he's being goaded in a Senate meeting to grandstand like some of some fucking people from"
"3419520","3422440"," Massachusetts are doing in that meeting."
"3422720","3424200"," So what he's basically saying though is this."
"3424340","3431560"," He's telling the market, hey, you're not getting an answer from me on fucking rate hikes today. "
"3431560","3432720"," You would have gotten them yesterday."
"3432880","3434240"," You would have gotten them yet the day before."
"3434780","3436520"," And that's what the market was positioned for. "
"3436880","3441420"," For him to come out into the market in the Senate meeting and drop a hammer like he did in"
"3441420","3442600"," 2018 and October."
"3443140","3447660"," With him not doing that, he's telling the market you have to wait until the FOMC meeting."
"3448340","3454600"," So the question then becomes are you telling me that the market's going to crash the 3300 until"
"3454600","3457180"," March 22nd and then maybe I guess maybe it could. "
"3458380","3462640"," But if the market does that and he comes out and says, no, we're not doing that, the market's going"
"3462640","3463480"," to scream higher, right?"
"3463660","3465940"," Million miles an hour to the high side."
"3466820","3468320"," So maybe that is the end of it."
"3468620","3471880"," But normally the market waits for the Fed. "
"3472080","3474260"," That's part of where that don't fight the Fed comes from."
"3475100","3479020"," Is you start fucking with the Fed and what they're going to do and they're telling you to just wait"
"3479020","3480040"," until the FOMC meeting."
"3480640","3489260"," So with that being said here, I'm not expecting numbers to come out into today, tomorrow, Monday"
"3489260","3494240"," and have like some rocket scientists that a hedge fund say, fuck it, we're selling everything. "
"3495900","3503000"," I'm not personally, so maybe, I guess maybe it's possible, but that does leave something else."
"3503120","3511420"," And that leaves where the market, what the market could do, could possibly do is have a hedge on it"
"3511420","3515540"," until into that meeting where they just don't remove it, right?"
"3515740","3522980"," And we saw that earlier this week, we saw that yesterday into the last half an hour, right?"
"3523240","3524900"," We saw it right in the last half an hour."
"3524960","3526340"," It was like, all right, fuck it, we're going to take it off. "
"3527260","3528620"," And they're sitting right here."
"3528780","3534680"," So the moment that they pull it off or you get enough buyers saying, hey, the Fed's not going to"
"3534680","3539340"," do anything into the 22nd, they're going to fucking ramp this thing right up into that FOMC"
"3539340","3539560"," meeting."
"3540240","3548660"," Now, with that said, right, with that said, they'll ramp it up into that FOMC meeting, is that it"
"3548660","3549320"," could go either way. "
"3549660","3550780"," I was looking at some data."
"3550960","3554900"," The F minus 84 BCF, the draw on the forecast of minus 83 BCF."
"3555700","3560960"," I was looking at some data in similar situations, similar patterns like this. "
"3561040","3567160"," We had in the past and breadth patterns and in similar circumstances."
"3567420","3569140"," And it goes two ways."
"3571100","3572040"," It's really crazy. "
"3572400","3579900"," You could end up having like two or three weeks into the 22nd where where we're like consolidating,"
"3579920","3581280"," but we're not really consolidating."
"3581280","3582300"," We're in like a holding pattern."
"3585940","3590920"," And we break down or up after a couple of weeks. "
"3592300","3596160"," And I don't think here that bulls or bears could call either side."
"3596340","3602300"," The worst part of that is if we break up or down, it's not going to be to the depths"
"3602300","3603920"," of hell or to all-time highs."
"3604560","3605280"," Not all time happens. "
"3605360","3611760"," I'm exaggerating here, but it's going to be, am I trapping a bear here?"
"3612900","3614360"," Hold on a second, let me get my phone, hold on."
"3616760","3622280"," I don't know if I'm trapping a bear here, but let me call a bear central."
"3623120","3624100"," Hold on here and make a phone call. "
"3625760","3626120"," Hello?"
"3629740","3630540"," This is a bear hotline."
"3633840","3636500"," I'm trying to find out, is this a bear trap?"
"3637460","3639020"," Can I get a definitive answer here?"
"3639100","3639500"," Yes or no?"
"3643380","3648520"," So, my point here though is that- Is that the weekly EIA natural gas report on the feed for"
"3648520","3648940"," those interested?"
"3649980","3663300"," My point here though is that, oh shit, my calls are, my"
"3663300","3664640"," calls are healthy right now."
"3664880","3665800"," They're doing really well. "
"3668840","3670580"," Very healthy calls right now."
"3670900","3673820"," Is your last chance bears in the next two or three minutes?"
"3675400","3676540"," Is your last chance?"
"3676720","3677780"," You better throw this shit over."
"3677980","3678880"," You got two minutes, right?"
"3679340","3681600"," Is this a bull hour or a bear hour?"
"3682200","3684000"," You tell me what it is right now. "
"3685480","3687640"," Thankfully, I'm not reading the chat at this point."
"3691540","3693500"," Yesterday, I caught reading the chat."
"3693820","3700980"," Why would I ever read the chat when I'm in a position that's saying that I would just- What"
"3700980","3702480"," are we printing right now?"
"3703540","3705520"," Am I at almost 100% right now?"
"3705680","3706120"," I want to know. "
"3715950","3717990"," I'm making stupid money right now."
"3718130","3720110"," I'm up like 89% or something."
"3726820","3729120"," I'm probably going to have a thousand percent day. "
"3729160","3730680"," I think I might have a thousand percent day today."
"3730780","3731140"," It's possible."
"3731620","3732200"," It's possible. "
"3734700","3737160"," It's very possible I could have a thousand percent day today."
"3746020","3748880"," All I got to do is pick a couple more minutes here so I don't get trapped."
"3749120","3750560"," I'll just put the sent off to the EIA reports. "
"3750800","3751340"," It's slightly different."
"3751340","3753180"," Just smash this shit right up there."
"3754780","3755980"," Just smash that. "
"3756120","3757400"," Give me a thousand percent day."
"3757500","3758000"," I want it so."
"3758700","3759320"," F and bad. "
"3760040","3760520"," Beep."
"3761300","3763660"," Oh, yeah."
"3766060","3767360"," Oh, yeah. "
"3770260","3772680"," Oh, yeah."
"3773420","3774300"," Give it to me."
"3777000","3779220"," Give me- Oh, yeah. "
"3779660","3780260"," Give it to me."
"3780400","3781580"," Put the pain on."
"3782820","3785160"," Put the pain on, baby. "
"3786760","3787740"," Put it on."
"3791900","3793240"," Oh, yeah."
"3793480","3794600"," Look at that pain trade. "
"3795380","3803080"," Oh, yeah."
"3810740","3812520"," Oh, I love that pain trade."
"3813620","3814680"," Feels good. "
"3818040","3819600"," Love that pain trade."
"3825120","3826780"," Love that pain trade."
"3827180","3828260"," Who's ours this?"
"3829000","3829940"," We don't know yet. "
"3830000","3831820"," We're going to find out right now who's ours is."
"3841040","3842080"," Oh, yeah, dude."
"3842160","3842840"," It's just pumping. "
"3847480","3849240"," Just pumping right now."
"3850280","3851200"," Just pumping."
"3851440","3858280"," So the point being here is that they ain't doing shit until Jerome Powell has his time. "
"3858660","3859820"," He told you that in the Senate."
"3859820","3865020"," You guys will read though, not you guys, but people on fucking social media in the news, they tell"
"3865020","3868740"," you the opposite of what he's actually saying."
"3868820","3874660"," I don't know why they do this, but he's telling you, sorry, you didn't get your fucking bloodbath"
"3875700","3876780"," on the Senate hearing. "
"3877220","3878560"," And no, I got to read."
"3878860","3881640"," It's funny because he's like, I went through it last night."
"3881840","3883600"," You guys thought I was sleeping last night. "
"3883720","3884160"," I wasn't sleeping."
"3884820","3887120"," I was watching that shit for two days on speed."
"3887900","3888600"," What is it?"
"3889520","3890760"," Binky calls it a five. "
"3891140","3892040"," Binky's like here."
"3892240","3892740"," I made a video."
"3894020","3897800"," Binky's like, I made a video of the Fed hearing on five times speed. "
"3898140","3898920"," I'm like, oh, okay."
"3899480","3901100"," He's like, you can watch it in 18 minutes."
"3901320","3902720"," I'm like, damn it, I got to watch it. "
"3903100","3907940"," So I'm watching the Fed Senate hearing on speedplay for 18 minutes both days."
"3909360","3911360"," And I'm like, I know exactly what he said."
"3911480","3913740"," He told just, sorry, you can't sell the market today. "
"3914300","3918520"," And then he told John the next day, sorry, you can't sell the markets day either."
"3918940","3919900"," And so now you got hedge funds."
"3920140","3920620"," What are they going to do?"
"3921040","3922020"," What's the else I got to do?"
"3922400","3924360"," Keep a hedge on for the next, I don't know. "
"3925340","3927280"," I don't know, next 22 days?"
"3927740","3927860"," Nah."
"3929040","3932980"," They're going to come into like Tesla that's been beaten down to crap."
"3933740","3936720"," And they're going to be like, how much do those zero dates cost for Tesla?"
"3937640","3939960"," And then they're going to be like, well, we were on the south side. "
"3940080","3942500"," Why don't we throw some risk on super dirt cheap?"
"3943380","3947920"," We'll buy some of those worthless Tesla calls for like one penny."
"3948160","3952040"," And we'll watch them go to $24 and make more money than we'll short the shit out of this as"
"3952040","3953500"," we head into the FOMC mean."
"3953540","3954140"," How's that sound?"
"3954260","3955100"," They're like, OK, let's do it. "
"3956800","3959520"," What are those 402 C's to printing right now?"
"3959700","3962220"," 48 cents right now."
"3964100","3965720"," 48 cents right now."
"3968810","3970010"," Who's short right now?"
"3970470","3971130"," You feeling it?"
"3972090","3973170"," You feeling it right now?"
"3975110","3981190"," If you're looking to take a trade here, the three trigger cluster is coming up currently. "
"3981490","3982350"," It keeps moving on up."
"3982570","3983510"," Where are we at right now?"
"3986450","3989970"," 399.73. It's now cranking up here."
"3990650","3991190"," It's now higher. "
"3993470","4000810"," Now have a three trigger cluster trying to build some support to smash through the literal literal"
"4003490","4004430"," sell side."
"4004670","4005190"," They're right here."
"4005450","4005890"," This is where they are. "
"4006690","4007530"," They're sitting right here."
"4007750","4008650"," They got nothing above."
"4009850","4011210"," Let's take a look and see. "
"4011510","4012870"," I'm not sweating as much anymore."
"4013670","4015770"," Let's look and see where they are."
"4018870","4019750"," Five days. "
"4023120","4024020"," They're right here."
"4029550","4030470"," That's where they are."
"4031830","4033210"," We get a three trigger cluster. "
"4033610","4038570"," It turns into a four trigger cluster and we literally effing moon right here."
"4040590","4041630"," Hello ladies."
"4042850","4043710"," Moon shot. "
"4048560","4049980"," Let me know how short you are."
"4050100","4050500"," I want to know."
"4051100","4051840"," I want to know. "
"4051980","4053580"," Tell me in the chat how short you are."
"4055220","4056060"," I want to know."
"4060690","4065790"," Tell me you're a bull and that you're buying this right here. "
"4065910","4067770"," I want to hear you coming in chat later today."
"4069690","4074710"," I want you to tell me that you're buying right there."
"4078930","4079410"," Right there. "
"4079470","4080030"," Do I get that right?"
"4080270","4081090"," I don't know if I got that right."
"4082050","4083750"," You let me know when you're buying up here."
"4084510","4085450"," You let me know. "
"4086550","4087410"," That's what is that?"
"4087570","4087750"," 403."
"4088470","4089890"," Let's look at a five day again."
"4090150","4090350"," What's that?"
"4090530","4090750"," 403. "
"4092110","4092630"," 404."
"4094170","4094550"," 404."
"4094550","4095029"," 404. "
"4095790","4096310"," 404."
"4097250","4097470"," Okay."
"4098450","4099850"," Let me know what you're buying today. "
"4101189","4101710"," 404."
"4104050","4104930"," Where's that at?"
"4105229","4105569"," Way up here."
"4105930","4105970"," 404. "
"4106050","4106529"," 14."
"4109500","4111160"," Right up there."
"4112420","4118000"," I don't care if we get there today. "
"4118000","4119700"," I don't care if we get there tomorrow."
"4120520","4121939"," I don't care when we get there."
"4122380","4123640"," We're fucking getting there. "
"4123939","4124800"," Kiss my ass."
"4125560","4126760"," That's where we're going right there."
"4128580","4130020"," So I want to see you right there. "
"4132359","4134140"," How much does calls cost for tomorrow?"
"4135100","4135580"," 404."
"4141600","4143000"," Oh, they're juicing them already."
"4143220","4145080"," $1.21 for calls for tomorrow. "
"4145920","4146819"," Come on, man."
"4148700","4149660"," Come on, man."
"4149660","4155680"," $1.04. 404 is for today only $0.09. I bet I could buy those 404s twice today. "
"4156180","4158120"," Like today for $0.09 and then tomorrow."
"4159580","4161359"," Give it a buy for today and tomorrow."
"4161859","4162279"," Maybe 401. "
"4162840","4163300"," Maybe not 404."
"4163859","4165100"," Maybe like 403s."

"6320520","6325260"," five right now and then you've got your daily trigger here at this yellow box I'm going to show it"
"6325260","6336990"," to you I'll read or draw it out for you daily trigger right there"
"6336990","6344410"," that's your daily trigger right there this is your hourly trigger right here right where you are"
"6344410","6351790"," the white and red are your one in five minute triggers and then you've got your weekly trigger and"

"6378570","6383510"," your weekly there's your monthly there is where J-POW would have gotten you your death and"
"6383510","6392980"," destruction hourly trigger right here one in five minute pre-trigger cluster right here"
"6392980","6400300"," we have velocity momentum heading to the bull side not the bare side I'll show that to you if you"
"6400300","6408250"," want briefly and bring up the spot wait a minute I don't need to take here"
"6408250","6417270"," so you can see velocity here I want to show you guys velocity"
"6417270","6427200"," this is a 30-minute chart on the spy five minutes not doing so"
"6427200","6432020"," hot right now right but what you really want to be paying attention to right now is this little bar"
"6432020","6439340"," down here wait to see this the daily velocity is turning from you know if this is the top this"
"6439340","6446740"," is the bottom makes sense if this is the top this is the bottom does that make sense so if"
"6446740","6451360"," you're looking on the daily the hourly you can see that the hourly is switching to the bull side"
"6451360","6459520"," see that so the intraday like one in five minute stuff is not on the bear's side it can go"
"6459520","6466160"," bearish but it's not bearish so right now whatever whatever nonsense this is right here this on"
"6466160","6471820"," this one minute chart really doesn't mean much it means that we're rolling bullish right now so"
"6471820","6477420"," we're building support to make a leg higher and so it doesn't matter to me it doesn't matter what"
"6477420","6483820"," we're doing down here it matters every hour as time passes that momentum goes to the bull side it"
"6483820","6490800"," is right now so less negative it becomes the more the buildup is to the squeeze higher the example"
"6490800","6499220"," would be the example would be let me show you a better example in this so let's look at it"
"6499220","6504100"," from this perspective okay do you see how the do you see how when we're topping out here we start"
"6504100","6512650"," to come down oh you guys can't see that do you see how when we're see how this see how"
"6512650","6517110"," we're topping watch my cursor down here see how those yellow bars are topping out right here you"
"6517110","6522010"," see how the green bars are topping out you see where the roll comes into play in the hourly you"
"6522010","6528470"," see this this this negative momentum in the market on the green and you see how when we start to"
"6528470","6534530"," level out on the hourly and then you start to see the velocity go down on the daily but now"
"6534530","6540790"," it's coming up today's bar you see how low it is it's right there so my cursor is right there"
"6540790","6548630"," so momentum is shifting here and not only is momentum shifting here but you've got buyers you got"
"6548630","6553550"," the man stepping in right now what's 11th and as long as that demand stays there in the one and"
"6553550","6558770"," five minute you had up to the hourly private it's building for a reptile and a pry a high yield"
"6558770","6565450"," of four foot five you can actually see the the no no no three times so we're trying to build"
"6565450","6572270"," momentum to be able to break through that resistance now if we do break through that resistance"
"6572270","6580650"," right what you're looking for here is a squeeze and to at least try to close this gap above that's"
"6580650","6587350"," at 404 14 you see what I'm saying stuff the bulls are able to take out this hourly and this"
"6587350","6592750"," and this one day you should see some kind of a move higher in a Friday or even Monday to"
"6592750","6599730"," close this up again at least repair all this crap back here so like wondering hey West capsule"
"6599730","6604790"," bullish here it's because we're not at a top on the hourly right we're not at a top"
"6604790","6614690"," on the I'm very bullish here extremely bullish until you"
"6614690","6619310"," rolled over you have to roll over and start start making like a new a new low on the day"
"6619310","6623730"," would be bearish so if you're a bear and you're like well how do we how do we get bearish"
"6623730","6633210"," again you have to close below you have to close like a closing low from the previous day so that's"
"6633210","6642450"," 396 back here so if you close today down here and like close the day down here though you'd be"
"6642450","6646510"," like yeah we won the hourly and we won the daily does that make sense we won the daily in"
"6646510","6651870"," the hourly we're getting super bearish in here it's right down here you have to close the day down"
"6651870","6657730"," here to remain extremely bearish here outside outside of that it's a matter of just consolidation"
"6657730","6665890"," and finding the strength to go higher in my view so so we see that now this looks like"
"6665890","6674910"," consolidation for for strength to break through the daily trigger above does that make sense that's"
"6674910","6682870"," how you get bearish or my view that's how you get bearish momentum has been turning up here so"
"6682870","6690370"," that's what I'm looking for for today and tomorrow and bears want nothing more than to break this"
"6690370","6695270"," trigger right now they need to break this trigger to get the hourly on their side to get bearish"
"6695270","6710080"," and then they need to break the daily to get more even more bearish yeah if"
"6710080","6713760"," you don't know what I'm talking about some of you out there do that as long as some of you"
"6713760","6750720"," know what I'm talking about that's all that matters but I'm sure"
"6750720","6755700"," I'm sure some of you buy calls when the hourly and the daily are on the on the high side"
"6755700","6763740"," and then you get burned I'm sure that happens I'm sure that's pretty frequent you get the hourly"
"6763740","6767560"," and the daily on the here on your side if you're a bull you have momentum on your side if"
"6767560","6774980"," you're a bull this is your best chance here as a bull for the market to go up you can"
"6774980","6792000"," see ES squeezing right now yes trying"

"9731760","9732980"," I'm going to watch out here."

"9740280","9745000"," I may not be losing these fifteen centers, but the thirty six centers I'm considering selling them"
"9745000","9746480"," up here in case you make another trip lower."
"9747460","9750420"," So I'll probably have to enter some other puts up here at some point. "
"9751240","9752680"," But right now I'm still long these calls."
"9758760","9761920"," I'm now up uh seven hundred and five thousand."
"9792340","9795780"," Three ninety eight's are holding value at fifty nine cents. "

"9839110","9840410"," For those are for Friday. "
"9840630","9846710"," So I'm not as concerned with the Netflix ones, but of course the spy zero dates are a concern."
"9847790","9850930"," And I am long right now in calls on uh uh spy."
"9857320","9858740"," And I'm gonna take a piss really bad. "
"9859920","9861580"," Matter of fact I might take a piss right here."
"9861780","9864060"," So I'm gonna take a five step like just five minute break."

"10128650","10129870"," We have a little chat here."
"10129890","10131410"," A little fireside chat. "

"10136210","10136950"," Hold on a second here."
"10139850","10141770"," I'm getting a text message this morning. "
"10142010","10144070"," Now there's a couple things here that's going on okay."
"10144470","10147090"," So let's take a look at this chart here."
"10148150","10153530"," So if raise your hand if you're here at the open this morning with me maybe you don't have to"
"10153530","10153910"," raise your hand. "
"10155350","10157010"," So there's there's issues here."
"10158350","10160270"," So the first issue is this okay."
"10161050","10163070"," Uh is that we took a trade right here okay. "
"10164690","10167670"," Right up here in R1 and we took profit here."
"10167790","10168590"," You see that over here."
"10169550","10172830"," I want to show you that one right there okay. "
"10173690","10174910"," I was a pretty decent winner there."
"10175990","10178490"," Uh we're getting angry here and I shouldn't be getting angry."
"10178730","10180670"," We had a second trade up here okay. "
"10180790","10182070"," This is a winner right here as well."
"10182710","10183650"," You see that one right there."
"10184630","10187590"," And in stream we said to you that this is a daily trigger. "
"10187590","10189430"," That's where the sellers are above right."
"10190670","10193790"," Uh and then I took another trade down here as a third trade up here."
"10193970","10195310"," Took another trade for a winner right. "
"10195410","10198130"," That's three trades winning in a row right."
"10198830","10202110"," And then somewhere over here I took some calls and they were getting beaten up."
"10202530","10204270"," And it took a put made some money down here. "
"10204390","10204890"," Does that make sense?"
"10206010","10207990"," So there's a few things going on here."
"10208030","10211130"," I'm reading in the chat people saying that they've got shit burning to zero."
"10212730","10213630"," That's a problem. "
"10213950","10215390"," That's a problem for this stream."
"10215750","10218290"," So I'm figuring a couple things are going on here."
"10219270","10225390"," So I think number one that you're either following my trades late and then hoping that it's making"
"10225390","10225730"," money. "
"10226450","10227530"," That's second that's an issue."
"10228390","10232990"," That maybe that you're seeing me take a trade inside stream and you're saying well fuck it he made"
"10232990","10233470"," money here."
"10233610","10237890"," I'm going to buy some calls and you know I'm buying at the wrong time or timing them incorrectly. "
"10238490","10240870"," So let's say let's say in here I'm buying a call."
"10241510","10242310"," Look over here."
"10244450","10245810"," Maybe you're buying a call. "
"10246090","10249450"," Maybe I'm buying a call down here and you actually bought a call right here."
"10249490","10250090"," Does that make sense?"
"10250770","10253250"," And so now you're upside down 20 30%."
"10253250","10254530"," That's an issue for me. "
"10255350","10260070"," Um and it's issue for me that you're not putting on your own rules to trade."
"10260290","10262690"," And if you're upside down to add to your trades and stuff like that."
"10263110","10264530"," But my last issue is this. "
"10264670","10269490"," I got up my bigger problem here is that I just made I think three or four decent trades."
"10270070","10276310"," I took a bad trade and then I took some puts to cover that trade make money on that trade."
"10277410","10278550"," And now we're trading higher here. "
"10278670","10279690"," And I mean calls right here."
"10280370","10285510"," But my real issue here is that I've got someone in chat saying I just read something in chat from"
"10285510","10293010"," somebody that said I was just texted to me that said I'm going to read the exact quote here."
"10296850","10304580"," You know longing into bloodbath someone saying you know you're people longing in the bloodbath. "
"10304860","10312000"," The real issue here is that you've got watchers of this show right that don't enter."
"10312240","10316740"," As a matter of fact I can guarantee you right now right I can guarantee you that there's probably"
"10318520","10323460"," 20 or 30 of you out there that did not buy calls down here at all."
"10323820","10326740"," And you're probably trying to enter calls right now and chasing. "
"10327620","10328640"," You understand what I'm saying."
"10328840","10330620"," So you're waiting until it happens."
"10331620","10336120"," And then when it happens you are then entering that trade. "
"10336440","10337020"," Does that make sense?"
"10337540","10344100"," So you end up chasing and then you end up saying something like well you know your bloodbath or"
"10344100","10349760"," someone over here is so it doesn't matter if it's on the put side or the long side or whatever"
"10349760","10355100"," you end up talking about something that's you know you're still up."
"10355440","10359540"," I'm going to assume at this point that someone was in puts right here in this stream right now."
"10360140","10364280"," Someone was in puts down here and they're getting fucking torched right now. "
"10365300","10366580"," Do you get what I'm saying?"
"10367400","10372020"," So you're getting you're getting alpha that you think is alpha but it's not right because you're"
"10372020","10376040"," kind of late and they're all like following this late alpha here."
"10377000","10381220"," And so you're getting counter alpha and then you're all fucked up inside my stream."
"10381880","10384700"," So first of all you shouldn't be trading like with me. "
"10385320","10386460"," That's like first number rule."
"10386580","10388160"," You have to see where these setups are."
"10388340","10391800"," Enter on what you should be watching the options chain as you should be. "
"10392400","10396160"," I'm going to assume that someone in here is in puts right now and they're either flat or getting"
"10396160","10396760"," fucked up."
"10398620","10403580"," And so that's my point is it's hard it's hard it's hard from an end."
"10403880","10406500"," It's like a problem where dog chases his tail right. "
"10407220","10411080"," You've got you'll say well look the move was down way up here right."
"10411400","10413220"," And it was always down all the way down here."
"10413900","10415480"," But it's just not true right. "
"10416000","10419140"," It's just not it's it doesn't those those I was watching these puts they didn't print."
"10419660","10422500"," They chewed them up up here and they they printed them down here finally."
"10424460","10427080"," And the trade wasn't put here either. "
"10427080","10430820"," So if you're a bitch and about getting puts back here you got fucked up up here."
"10431400","10435840"," You know so they guess the idea here is it turns into a chasing your own tail kind of a"
"10435840","10436020"," thing."
"10436540","10440500"," You think that it's one way and then you find out that it's just someone that's not taking the"
"10440500","10441480"," trade when they're supposed to. "
"10442200","10444160"," So for my end that's how I see it normally."
"10444600","10449180"," Normally I'll sit there and I'll see it and you see the counter you see the counter trend in the"
"10449180","10454900"," chat but the chat is actually behind the trade or not at that point."
"10455140","10456880"," So just for yourself if you're out there trading. "
"10458040","10462880"," It's not a question of it's not a question of you know I'm going to watch this rip three times"
"10462880","10464560"," then jump on the top side of this."
"10465320","10470140"," It's that you have to find out where that trade is going and take that trade with your own risk"
"10470140","10470620"," out there."
"10471780","10477580"," But that's important I think that's important for you understand if I'm super bullish here then"
"10477580","10480540"," there's an argument that you're like hey I'm super bearish here right. "
"10481200","10487420"," And the truth is we're trading a one minute chart not a day chart or an hourly chart or anything"
"10487420","10488400"," like that right."

"11873530","11881630"," changes for the bulls right so you need to build momentum here to break above right so bears don't"
"11881630","11886670"," want to see that happen sellers don't want to see they're trying to throw it down on you right now"
"11886670","11891150"," above here and you can see we're breaking the weekly trigger right here there's no news events in"

"12014610","12019030"," the 11 years uh they were not long around commute this for a minute let's be clear about something"
"12019030","12024890"," a lower low is when you beat the lower the low from yesterday not today now you do have lower"
"12024890","12030310"," lows on the day we don't have a lower low today the lower low would be lower the pivot points"
"12030310","12038890"," are 396 59 right it right here you need bears need a lower low on the day from yesterday not"
"12038890","12045530"," today does that make sense they got to have it from yesterday not today so all this here is"
"12045530","12052850"," semantics that's all this is right now all this is semantics all of the trend is on the move up"
"12052850","12064080"," and it's to break up break through this daily trigger above thank for"
"12064080","12068980"," all the emotions and the drama and all of this stuff you still don't have a lower low on the"
"12068980","12074680"," day right we don't have one yet to get that lower low on the day you have to break right"
"12074680","12081180"," through this last uh h line down here 396 58 and this is what gives you the daily earlier we"
"12081180","12085700"," were talking about the daily and the hourly right the bears winning the hourly are they winning the"
"12085700","12090840"," daily uh trigger if they win the daily then they get that extra big uh bar right they get the"
"12090840","12095940"," extra yellow bar on the day so until they make that new low down here there is no loss for"
"12095940","12099700"," a bull if you bought the mark if you bought a spot if you bought spy in the low yesterday"
"12100180","12105160"," you're green today no matter what's happened at this point today you're green if you own the spy"
"12105160","12121470"," right now that sounds"
"12121470","12129770"," crazy you know i mean while we're all getting wildly like wild up in here or not wild up in"
"12129770","12135810"," here but you know this is bearish it's like well no we're actually up on yesterday we're actually"
"12135810","12142970"," green today on yesterday well at least on yesterday's low in terms of pivots and stuff like that"
"12142970","12151710"," and that figure is right down here at 396 58 might be 56 it's somewhere down there uh 59"
"12151710","12157590"," i got it down a tick it has to be up one tick 396 59 would be the low on"
"12157590","12167410"," the day that's the one that the bears want"
"12167410","12175230"," the bears want below the bears what below 396 59 guaranteed because then you got a lower low right"
"12175230","12181050"," you got a lower low yesterday a lower low today uh any kind of a higher high any kind of"
"12181050","12186270"," a higher low today is actually bullish right we got a lower low yesterday we got a higher low today"
"12186270","12218440"," on the close yeah"
"12218440","12221920"," we're going to get the we have to get the we have to do is build the momentum to get"
"12221920","12226420"," above the daily trigger and they're not going to give it up nicely because you know it's an"
"12226420","12234000"," automatic squeeze we squeeze up from the daily trigger and there's no news out there that i can see"
"12234000","12243160"," that warrants bloodbath down at 360 or down to 3300 if there was trust me i'd be fucking net short"
"12243160","12249960"," this market right now um i was looking for it earlier in the week with the senate meeting if we"
"12249960","12255420"," broke below the weekly in the monthly it's on right if we if we hear uh Jerome Powell say we're"
"12255420","12261820"," going up 50 bps or hundred you know like hundred points or something or i don't know he's cutting"
"12261820","12267540"," rates in the market i'd be net short this market but we're not seeing it you know until we see"
"12267540","12273920"," that uh they're not going to sell this market in my view unless we have some unknown news so what"
"12273920","12279500"," is this a matter of their short or they're protecting them you've got sell side funds that are"
"12279500","12285460"," protecting themselves with uh zero dates on the spy specifically and the moment that they close"
"12285460","12293420"," them out we're going to rip faces off to go north in my view at least and it's paid me"
"12293420","12300400"," very well even the last two weeks i was down earlier in the week and closed both weeks green uh"
"12300400","12309610"," because of course they pulled their shorts off the market and we ripped face i think i was talking"
"12309610","12314770"," about that on fin to it that once one zero dates one out what once zero dates got popular on"
"12314770","12319490"," fin on fin to it i was like i wonder who's pushing this narrative of course the banks are trying"
"12319490","12325410"," to push it uh but you can see that there's cheap hedging specifically on the spy so in video going"
"12325410","12330590"," up you saw apple going up earlier today and not the spy so they're actively pinning the spy because"
"12330590","12335910"," it's cheap right you can buy cheap puts and the moment they take them off we're we're fucking"
"12335910","12341910"," ripping we're going to to the moon right and we're closing out a week right now and we're at this"
"12341910","12348930"," resistance point on the daily you saw sell off it i literally drew you out a box above here and"
"12348930","12353610"," said that they're gonna try to sell this down here until we can get enough momentum to break"
"12353610","12363440"," through enough buyers right uh and so the the implication here is when do they"
"12363440","12368600"," lift those shorts that were not shorts but when do they close out a fuck ton of zero date puts"
"12368600","12388750"," uh for the market to go higher we're not the market but spy specifically yeah i"
"12388750","12393150"," think and i want to thank anyone that's put in their positioning inside of the chat i appreciate"
"12393150","12402860"," you for doing that and you know i don't care if i think um"
"12402860","12410640"," yeah you can find like uh i think there are websites where you can paper trade i know that some"
"12410640","12417740"," brokerages allow it i don't know which ones but i know that some do allow paper trading you can"
"12417740","12422440"," paper trade this you don't have to tell people i'm paper trading it just just enter the position in"
"12422440","12427000"," the paper trade so you can see if you're winning or losing before you trade with real money rather"
"12427000","12432400"," than getting cut up because you can go there's another great site there's a great website um called"
"12432400","12439900"," uh i tried to put i posted it here once before but i can't seem to find it where you"
"12439900","12445480"," can even back test what you're doing so if you're taking actual real trades you can actually back"
"12445480","12449940"," test where you made mistakes where you should have taken winners where you should have cut yourself"
"12449940","12457040"," do you guys use stop limits out there that's another big question right are you putting stops in"
"12457040","12462660"," you take two three four five stops then you make one kick-ass trade that goes the direction that"
"12462660","12469320"," you want are you trading both sides of these trades another big part of this uh if you're if you're"
"12469320","12473860"," trading the one in five minute going up and it rolls over on you're jumping on the other side to"
"12473860","12483830"," try to get back the the losers on that side there's another big part of it and if you don't"
"12483830","12489310"," know how to do that stuff you have to join us in the discord because they'll explain to you how"
"12489310","12500520"," to do that stuff the craziest"
"12500520","12507140"," part too is if i had held those puts longer i would have bought free calls right would have owned"
"12507140","12513240"," free calls and have been up like 12 or 15 cents um and that's being in two sides of the"
"12513240","12524450"," trade right you just saw me in two sides of a trade i'm just"
"12524450","12534110"," gonna find this website for you and we're actually building a we're building a back testing tool so"
"12534110","12541070"," that we can um go back and look at our trades do we have to find find this uh website"
"12541070","12548150"," here one of the tools that we're building in the background is a um no i didn't i haven't talked"
"12548150","12553090"," about it because i don't know when it's coming out but we're building a tool right now where you"
"12553090","12560510"," can um paper trade and then look back over their week or two or even a month and say where"
"12560510","12565370"," was i making money where was i not making money do i need to add another side to this trade"
"12565370","12571890"," uh my buying like a 20 cent put a 20 cent call and then printing 40 cents and walking away"
"12571890","12581840"," with 20 right but we will have that tool available to you"
"12584750","12590130"," i don't know when that tool because that tool is complicated to uh right it's going to take time to"
"12590130","12597190"," get that tool to you guys but that tool is going to be simple not rocket science nothing like that"
"12597190","12605180"," put your entries in your exits in and then you find out uh where you went wrong as a matter"
"12605180","12635210"," of fact i gotta write something out here for that i'm looking"
"12635210","12645070"," to add some calls here i'm looking at i like the 399s i've got some"
"12645070","12649990"," burning 401s i've got 400s that have a little bit of life left into them but now i'm looking at"
"12649990","12659870"," some 399s here i'm going to watch uh 399 and 398 here three four there's 348 000"
"12659870","12665430"," puts at 399 for a dollar 54 i'm hoping i can steal some of the juice off of those at"
"12665430","12672390"," some point coming up in just a few minutes and i'm going to try to find this back testing website"
"12672390","12682170"," for you if i can here in the background while i'm watching this stuff it's called trade well t-r "
"12682170","12688790","-a-d-e-w-e-l-l uh i think they have a free a free way to back test"
"12688790","12700460"," your own trades so you can see where you're a winner and a loser oh dude"
"12700460","12747190"," i need to pick this trade up hold on it's like"
"12747190","12764380"," bouncing around 33.36 i got bags sitting here too i'm missing a trade right now they"
"12764380","12770080"," already took uh 55 cents off those uh puts and now what i 55 they're down to a dollar 18"
"12780780","12801660"," i'm missing this trade right now maybe it'll come back down and retest real quick for me uh"
"12801660","12810460"," tradewell.com now i i find trade well to not be complicated but it's not the easiest uh site to"
"12810460","12816200"," figure out it took me some work to figure out how to back test there with the tool that we're"
"12816200","12823260"," building the idea behind it would be if i meet you and you come hang out with us i would"
"12823260","12830540"," direct you to just paper trade so you'd go to the website you would watch the broadcast and then"
"12830540","12836540"," you would just paper trade along with us and then after a week or two or a month you'd go"
"12836540","12841940"," back and you'd look at those trades and see where your winners are and your losers are and you can"
"12841940","12848100"," have kind of a journal that says uh this is what i'm making great trades i'm making bad trades um"
"12848100","12855220"," maybe i'm in trades too long or my positioning is wrong i'm early or i'm late any of those kinds"
"12855220","12871660"," of things and it should be kind of simplified oh"
"12871660","12877720"," yeah i could but you can see it right here when i'm moving my cursor across it's 1306 right now"
"12877720","12882240"," you can actually so you can't get you can see it see my cursor right here you can actually see"
"12882240","12888760"," where we are but uh i've had been asked for a clock in this in the stream um and i"
"12888760","12892100"," can look for i'll look for a widget and see if i can put a widget down here so we"
"12892100","12903130"," can time that stuff yeah that's"
"12903130","12909310"," another thing too i got j more x's in here saying risking five percent you know we were i was"
"12909310","12914950"," talking with um i was talking with another guy earlier this week and i'm like the trader's fallacy"
"12914950","12922610"," is not in taking trades it's it's when you find out what they're trading with like oh i'm trading"
"12922610","12930090"," fucking hundred percent of my my account on one trade or the other my other favorite one is i"
"12930090","12935290"," traded one percent or five percent of my account i made a bunch of money and so i scaled it"
"12935290","12941930"," up to 50 percent of my account usually when you look at a journal of somebody's trading you usually"
"12941930","12946490"," find it in i made one good trade and i scaled up to like 30 percent of my account in"
"12946490","12953890"," a trade does it make sense i know some of you are trying to build an account i know that"
"12953890","12959230"," that works but you're making one trade a week right you're just placing it all on black until you"
"12959230","12966390"," hit 30 or 50 000 dollars i get that but you know what happens you make that 30 or 50"
"12966390","12972930"," grand and you don't go back to trading your paycheck you rent you let 30 grand ride i know you"
"12972930","12977270"," do they used to do it that's how i used to do it that's how i used to blow up"
