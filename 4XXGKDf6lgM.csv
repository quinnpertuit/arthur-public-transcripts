"1031060","1038500"," is now the 55th of 57 quarters in which actual results have exceeded end-of-quarter estimates And"
"1038500","1044040"," when you look to profit margins themselves they for this second quarter have risen from an estimate"

"1054040","1059660"," in their profit margins in this second quarter So actually the the belief is that we are seeing"

"1105440","1114240"," Well, I think that 2024 Historically has a wonderful track record a first year president up for"
"1114240","1121160"," reelection We see a very strong advance on average with a very high frequency of advance So"
"1121160","1128540"," basically the market is saying don't worry about it We traditionally have a positive third year as"
"1128540","1134620"," we're experiencing right now And usually the gravitation is toward the economically sensitive areas"

"3098950","3104090"," economies around the world We've had a ton of data recently when it shows When it comes to global"
"3104090","3109990"," commerce china is the world's biggest exporter this week Or reported the biggest contraction and"

"3133730","3139690"," right now senior economist managing director at bemo capital markets jennifer Basically, we're"
"3139690","3145370"," we're kind of trying to gauge Who's going into recession and and if it's possible for the us to"
"3145370","3146090"," have a soft landing."
"3146250","3146630"," What do you think?"
"3147810","3148430"," Good morning. "
"3148670","3149510"," Thanks for having me on."
"3149750","3155630"," Um, you know what we have been in the soft landing camp For most of those whole period and we"
"3155630","3160310"," are still standing by that and it looks like a lot of other analysts are jumping on to Onto this"
"3160310","3166310"," uh, this family again as well, but it's all comes back to strong job growth strong wage growth"
"3166950","3171630"," Resilient consumer and that's all helping everything and it plus it's certainly helping that we saw"
"3171630","3177870"," But was it like three months in a row now of moderating consumer price inflation gains And that is"
"3177870","3181110"," definitely good news and gives the fed a little bit of breathing room of course What we saw this"
"3181110","3185270"," morning on the ppi front still a lot of hot doesn't mean that so means that inflation has a"
"3185270","3189990"," completely gone away Not that anyone expected, but I think it sort of helps solidify like overall"
"3189990","3193970"," like this big picture Soft landing story looks like it's in an attack."
"3194390","3198690"," We actually, um, you know, we're only looking for like a one quarter now of negative growth Early"
"3198690","3204130"," next year Around the turn of the year and before you know, so it's it's not gonna be great growth,"
"3204470","3210530"," but it's gonna be growth regardless So, um, I think that's the the soft landing narrative I mean"
"3210530","3214870"," you think about that the world's largest economy staying out of recession, but oxford economics"
"3215570","3221970"," Still projecting that advanced economies are going to see that recession if a shallow one Um early"
"3221970","3230630"," or late 2023 early 2024 is that something you agree with and why or why not So in terms of"
"3230630","3234330"," advanced economies, and so that's you know, that's you know, so we got no more more countries"
"3234330","3239710"," Blooped into or lumped into that, you know for Canada We're looking for also a softish landing, but"
"3239710","3243590"," you know where we've already started to see some headwinds play out Uh, you know north of the"
"3243590","3247170"," border now elsewhere now This is kind of interesting because I was thinking about this recently so"
"3247170","3251050"," at the beginning there you were all thinking that you know potential hard landing Um, you know,"
"3251110","3255390"," again big picture here, but then now we're sitting now the world's sort of thinking soft landing"
"3255390","3260970"," the us But now the whole hard landing Concept is being playing is starting to show up more often. "
"3261150","3267150"," I think across Europe Just because perhaps the central banks there are more gung-ho on raising"
"3267150","3272630"," rates and keeping rates at these restricted highly restrictive levels For longer than uh, for"
"3272630","3277330"," longer Um, these to be of course in the Bank of England, so I think that has the potential to"
"3277330","3284550"," to weigh I think overall on the aggregate Um advanced economies grouping but the us again is"
"3284550","3288910"," hopefully going to pull its weight and you know, and if we are right It's gonna land land on its"
"3288910","3293870"," feet Um, it's not going to be completely, you know, we're still going to see this this rise or a"
"3293870","3298670"," pickup in unemployment Uh, there's still going to be some pain, but it's not going to be a large"
"3298670","3303090"," contraction at least not from what we're we're standing right now But of course like central"
"3303090","3303290"," bankers."
"3303630","3304610"," We are very data dependent."
"3304910","3310830"," So you're looking at a soft landing here in the us You're looking at a continental Europe that we"
"3310830","3314950"," thought, you know was going to avoid a recession But now looks like it's declining into one. "
"3315330","3317210"," What about the island nation?"
"3317210","3323550"," Uh of Great Britain Um, it's it's had a I guess a decent quarter in terms of growth, but it's"
"3323550","3329830"," got real problems in terms of inflation Yes, so that's a very difficult one to call and it"
"3329830","3335330"," surprised everybody of this morning with its point with its Increase in in the second quarter a big"
"3335330","3340730"," increase in june although that could be related to a couple of special factors So we could see"
"3340730","3344070"," we'll probably see some sort of a reversal or some reversal."
"3344550","3351510"," I think in july But All the colonies continue to to um pick up and it's even in the first"
"3351510","3355910"," quarter for italy I mean it was a big two and a half percent jump which surpassed any of everyone's"

"3364250","3368710"," coming out of the central bankers out there and plus the fact that especially in the uk As you as"

"3378190","3380870"," Well into next year before we see any kind of relief. "
"3381090","3385490"," So I think that is going to put so more pressure on the bank of england um, and that's going"

"3428950","3434070"," all this hawkish talk Um worried about hard landing and then suddenly you know in a couple months"
"3434070","3439030"," where we're gonna kind of reconsider I think it's it's very possible again because you know, we"

"3474390","3479130"," might move We could see even more um and at least some more hawkish talk just to bring just to"
"3479130","3484310"," bring down inflation expectations And that again, I think is where all of this uncertainty is going"
"3484310","3487670"," to it's going to play out Is to how far they're going to take it and how far our consumers"
"3487670","3493250"," can can go with such high inflation rates and high interest rates I'm looking at the uh, well, I I"

"3544990","3548490"," and and and prices and you know here food prices are starting to maybe they're not coming down But"
"3548490","3551310"," they're at least stabilized and they're not rising as such a quick pace."

"4082410","4089090"," Thanks for joining us in the interactive broker studio Uh, why are you optimistic that inflation"
"4089090","4090290"," will continue to decline?"
"4090890","4094970"," Well, I think one of the reasons is that we've seen most of the inflationary fuel dissipates so"
"4094970","4098670"," monetary growth has has all but Flatlined here."
"4099170","4103210"," You've seen all of the supply chain problems dissipate the index that's widely maintained and"
"4103210","4105670"," followed there really only hit normal Just a few months ago."
"4106250","4110970"," You've seen a lot of the demand swings in the economy start to normalize We're still seeing some of"
"4110970","4116370"," that but supply and demand a bit more stable And allowing companies to really produce at a level"
"4116370","4120870"," that that they need to to keep prices in check And so I'm relatively optimistic on the pace of"
"4120870","4125210"," inflation continuing to decline from an economic perspective But I think from a market perspective,"
"4125510","4129050"," we've maybe gotten a little bit of ahead of ourselves and there's a bit more work to do It's"
"4129050","4136170"," interesting because These cpi figures don't necessarily Uh look ahead to things like rising oil"
"4136170","4141410"," prices Uh and the impacts I mean when we think of the fed they're looking at this core number that"
"4141410","4147770"," strips out all this other stuff that is the stuff That consumers potentially feel most strongly Um,"
"4148210","4153109"," is this going to change the fed's thinking is this going to change their reaction to some of these"
"4153109","4156930"," data that we get So the way that I look at that on a go-forward basis of trying to"
"4156930","4161370"," estimate the the pace of the decline in cpi And I think that's the real open question mark for for"
"4161370","4165189"," markets here I think you're right there are a number of things that are likely to put some upward"
"4165189","4169649"," pressure on cpi and the energy complex certainly being one of those Um, the one that's the biggest"
"4169649","4173950"," one of course on the downside is housing And so when we look through some of those estimates of how"
"4173950","4178729"," much of the contribution from cpi from housing well over 2 percent It looks like maybe middle of"
"4178729","4184510"," next year that that starts to go flat So if I add back in more energy inflation than we have"
"4184510","4189370"," currently and I take out the housing Um, I get to a point where I sort of estimate we hit"
"4189370","4193830"," that 2 percent fed target sometime in the middle of next year So we're still a ways away from that"
"4193830","4197590"," and then beyond that we still have to ask the question What will the fed do if and when we"
"4197590","4198410"," hit that 2 percent?"
"4198630","4202370"," So I think that's why the market's struggling a little bit here with inflation's improved a lot I"
"4202370","4206390"," think we've factored most of that in and we're sort of looking for some additional fuel What do you"
"4206390","4207810"," think you think the fed is going to hold?"
"4208530","4214150"," Uh at this level right and what in 2024 start to cut I think it won't be at least until"
"4214150","4218730"," the middle or late in 2024 until they start to cut I think I based that somewhat on the comments"
"4218730","4223210"," that we saw from uh, New York Fed President Williams talking a little bit about the restrictiveness"
"4223210","4228250"," of policy increases as inflation comes down So if we do see inflation coming down a bit, I think"
"4228250","4231730"," they may cut just a bit just enough over the real process too, right?"
"4231850","4238250"," This is the passive Uh hike that we got basically yesterday right when cpi came down even though"
"4238250","4241850"," rates were the same It essentially gives you a higher real rate. "
"4242150","4246050"," Yes, and I think even that process that will take some time It's not like they're going to take you"
"4246050","4251310"," know 200 to 300 basis points out in a single meeting It'll be this measured pace of very slow cuts"
"4251310","4255550"," later in the year So I think there's still a long timeline for for rates being a bit elevated here"
"4255550","4263270"," and creating a bit of a drag on the economy Yeah, the ponderous 25 basis points Then we'll see and"
"4263270","4268030"," we'll pause and we'll see in that that kind of message Um, impact on corporate profits."
"4268030","4272050"," I mean are we at the end of a potential earnings recession?"
"4272130","4273410"," Will we see things improve from here?"
"4273790","4275090"," I think we're getting close to that."
"4275210","4280110"," So I based that on two things one is I do think economic growth is mostly stabilized and while Um,"
"4280110","4283750"," I think we'll be running at around one and a half percent It certainly could be a little bit lower"
"4283750","4288730"," than that in the next few quarters If the the the rate stress and bank stress weighs more heavily"
"4288730","4292750"," than I'm expecting But I think in terms of looking out to next year, there's reason for some"
"4292750","4297150"," optimism I've started to see some signals in earnings reports this past quarter that companies are"
"4297150","4301750"," making improvements in productivity Enhancement and I think some of that has been masked by the the"
"4301750","4305490"," wild swings We've had in the economy in the past few years now that we get back to a much"
"4305490","4309290"," more stable backdrop I think some of those productivity gains will start to flow through So I"
"4309290","4313550"," wouldn't be surprised if next year is marked by a period of slightly increasing margins and getting"
"4313550","4316850"," a little bit of upside on the on the earnings What do you think about the labor fight so they"
"4316850","4317090"," too?"
"4317950","4324150"," um, you know industry specific and uh spread out you've got you know Labor fight over streaming"
"4324150","4328190"," you've got a labor fight and automotive production, but there's some big numbers that we're looking"
"4328190","4332570"," at right Yes, and I think we saw some of that in different industries during the pandemic"
"4332570","4337670"," particularly in service industries My take on that is that I think in an overall cost basis for"
"4337670","4337930"," companies. "
"4338170","4340070"," They can manage it So it's good for the consumer."
"4340390","4344290"," It's good for the people getting increased pay But I think you do that with perhaps less headcount"
"4344290","4348690"," And we've started to see some of that companies holding the line on headcount or companies that in"
"4348690","4352270"," industries that have been disrupted in the pandemic it's staffing levels lower than they were in"
"4352270","4355250"," 2019 and higher capacity in terms Of the number of customers."
"4355550","4360310"," They're serving so wages might be going up on a on a basis of hourly wages for employees But lower"
"4360310","4362210"," headcount or flat headcount on higher revenue. "
"4362430","4363750"," Uh, okay for margins."
"4363970","4367830"," So the bottom line for stocks We're at we're just under s&p 4500 right?"
"4368150","4371970"," Uh, we come in about two and a half percent the last couple weeks, but you think we're going to"

"6536870","6542210"," 29 But there's kind of a blip there where we can still tweak with the data and move it back"
"6542210","6545950"," even further It's just something we have to do with the excel data But if you put in 30 it"
"6545950","6550630"," automatically change it to 29 But if you do that you look at the 29 year average for august"

"6555170","6560550"," tenths of a percent So you'll see september being typically the worst month and then August right"

"6592990","6599310"," a tough month But july Actually still held up really well and actually the past 16 years if you"
"6599310","6604210"," look at the qqq as well It's been up for 16 consecutive years for the s&p 500 in the"
"6604210","6610830"," month of july So it's some interesting tidbits there looking ahead to next week though We aren't"

"6615590","6622930"," for the s&p 500 having reported This is when we're going to start hearing from walmart Target It's"
"6622930","6626550"," interesting both of those companies are technically in the staples sector because they have a"
"6626550","6631870"," higher percentage of grocery sales Target had been in discretionary but got moved back in march"
"6631870","6636390"," because of some of the gix changes going on But then also we'll hear from other companies like"

"6657090","6663150"," interesting stuff something I like to look at so you can look at the ratio from equal weight For"
"6663150","6667890"," the staple sector and then also equal weight for discretionary to kind of get the noise out from"
"6667890","6673910"," because you do have amazon In tesla and is the discretionary sacred sector and to watch it kind of"
"6673910","6677930"," where it's headed Typically that can be a view of wall street as far as where they think the"
"6677930","6681970"," projection of the economy is because typically you'd want to see Discretionary outperform staples"
"6681970","6688370"," which we saw the opposite effect last year But that's steadily been moving higher all year And so"
"6688370","6692910"," that can tell you really when you're thinking about investors view of the economy That's basically"

"6768730","6774390"," quick Matt is because I was also pulling data earlier this week about the flows in the energy"
"6774390","6779130"," sector So specifically if you're looking at the 80 listed us exchange treated products because"
"6779130","6783490"," there's also some etns in there For energy companies, there's been around 11 and a half billion"
"6783490","6787590"," dollars in outflows So it's more than obviously all the other sectors combined But some people are"
"6787590","6791750"," kind of wondering now if it's hidden inflection point in a contrarian zone where there's just been"
"6791750","6796030"," so much pain in outflows That maybe we'll start to see that reversing here And we have seen"
"6796030","6799710"," obviously when you're looking at crude price is holding up better than expected I'll send you this"
"6799710","6801490"," story and expected to rise, right?"
"6801630","6806370"," I mean this I think the consensus is for the at least the people that we've been talked to last"
"6806370","6808530"," week They expect true prices to ride."
"6808590","6809230"," It's interest arise. "
"6809530","6815590"," It's interesting how much energy earnings have just Crushed yes everything else right because so"
"6815590","6816550"," far this earnings season."
"6816790","6820770"," We're down about 8% I think on the bottom line for all the companies that reported on the s "
"6820770","6825970","&p which is like 450 so far And it's but it's skewed by the weakness in energy earnings are down"
"6825970","6832650"," Yeah, so it's asking some of the improvement in other sectors like industrials Discretionary in"
"6832650","6837130"," things of those natures and even technology too that have benefited from those margin cutting but"
"6837130","6843370"," the comparables are so Terrible for the energy sector because think of where we were In you know"
"6843370","6850870"," the three months ending in June say in 2022 Right, we were at these Energy prices and we what"
"6850870","6857070"," energy analysts are saying all year Yeah, is that we should expect tighter oil supplies come the"
"6857070","6861630"," end of the year and that was before you know saudi arabia decided to Make all these production"
"6861630","6862070"," cuts."
"6862070","6867010"," Yeah, so Especially when you look at those year-over-year effects and then also how much of that"
"6867010","6873330"," rides on how much of the energy Forecast rides on china's economy I think a lot you know, you know"
"6873330","6879210"," that the demand has not been there Yeah, but you know a recovery has been slower than normal, but"
"6879210","6880850"," it's still a recovery, right?"

"6955190","6963590"," treasure yields tick back up to higher levels eric what has What has I guess this supply That what"
"6963590","6965670"," effect has this supply had on the muni market?"
"6966450","6972250"," I mean the same things has been going on all year right where we have low primary supply And"
"6972250","6976770"," there's still flows coming into the municipal space, you know, not as robust as previous years But"
"6976770","6980770"," there's still people who don't want to pay taxes That's really the bottom line here and they're"
"6980770","6985710"," willing to pay up in price and we're seeing that in positive returns for the year I mean in fact,"
"6985710","6990670"," you know, munis are probably outpacing Taxable alternatives by about a hundred basis points in"
"6990670","6999310"," total returns so far this year not too bad How much of this is tied to these ongoing Um, the"
"6999310","7004730"," salt restrictions Uh that were put into place under the trump administration is that is that why"
"7004730","7008750"," people are so keen on these tax benefits I mean in high tax dates. "
"7008970","7012730"," Yeah, of course right in New York, California People still don't want to pay taxes and they had a"
"7012730","7017390"," key tax break taken away from them Um, you know, will we see that come back when some of these"
"7017390","7018150"," provisions sunset?"
"7018950","7019750"," Probably not."
"7020090","7023130"," Uh, it seems like very unpopular provision to put back in, right?"
"7023290","7027110"," They've already you know, sort of capped that at 10,000 But look that's good for my market."
"7027250","7033570"," It's going to keep that normally higher demand for those coastal states Talk to me about how this"
"7033570","7040730"," plays out Uh, if we see the fed kind of continuing Um to say on pause perhaps if that is"
"7040730","7046030"," the expectation in markets Um, does this change the story as we watched a fed move into a different"
"7046030","7051850"," kind of pattern You know with this inverted yield curve the the opportunity set in unis has changed"
"7051850","7052750"," a little bit, right?"
"7053250","7057290"," So, you know in prior worlds we'd say, you know laddering a portfolio would make the most sense"
"7057290","7061970"," Here we're taking more of a barbell approach and in the front end of the curve It doesn't really"
"7061970","7065570"," make a lot of sense to be buying unis in there and you know, we're telling a lot of people"
"7065570","7069230"," that we speak to you're better off Buying corporates are better off buying treasuries. "
"7069630","7073870"," Um, long end of the curve munis make a lot more sense Um, and we think that you know as"
"7073870","7078770"," the fed stays on pause, they're still going to continue to outpace corporates I mean as an example"
"7078770","7081190"," 30 year munis on a tax equivalent yield basis."
"7081530","7087010"," You're picking up 130 basis points over single aerated corporates I mean really cheap Are you"
"7087010","7088410"," starting to see people go out the curve?"
"7088650","7093370"," I mean, that's the talk we've been hearing Yeah, absolutely And when I just looked at the fed"
"7093370","7098030"," holdings data prior to hopping on the call and individual holdings and munis are the highest"
"7098030","7103290"," they've been since It would take mid 2021 So there is activity coming back in in the individual"
"7103290","7107710"," holdings for municipal's this year And I think at these higher rates are really drawing people in"
"7107710","7114130"," that's so weird to me eric because I think about um the fiscal spending situation over the last few"
"7114130","7120890"," years and uh, the infrastructure bill the amount of money going from washington dc to Local"
"7120890","7127530"," communities to municipalities across the country and I would think Uh, they have far fewer reasons"
"7127530","7130710"," to issue because they have so much more money, right?"
"7131110","7136170"," Yeah 100 and that's why it's another reason we're saying lower primary supply in our market, right?"
"7136570","7140550"," They're still sort of siphoning off a lot of that stimulus cash they had coming in and look to be"
"7140550","7145530"," honest You know one wants to buy a house and mortgage at like seven and a half percent rate A"
"7145530","7149170"," lot of issues don't want to issue bonds at higher rates So they might be a little trying to market"
"7149170","7152950"," time to some degree But at some point they're going to have to come back in the market regardless"
"7152950","7156630"," of where the fed is Talk to me about some of the issuance that's hitting the market."
"7156710","7157590"," Uh, New York city. "

"7160470","7164950"," New York tfa was a recent issuer that came back in the market And we're seeing strong demand across"
"7164950","7170430"," the board for these coastal names, you know People don't want to pay their in-state taxes, and this"
"7170430","7176030"," is one way they can avoid that Hmm And I believe there was a couple stories in the last couple"
"7176030","7183470"," of weeks about the likes of you know bar harbor or Hamptons going I believe he's Hampton was that"
"7183470","7183670"," right?"
"7184110","7188410"," Uh going into the market as well That was interesting because more people are staying in the"

"10079550","10088190"," the the news Uh, uh, comparison was particularly harsh, uh, because the the belt and and road, uh"
"10088190","10095510"," initiative by china has become a bit of a, uh, uh a weight around she's neck actually because, uh,"
"10095970","10103150"," it's everyone complains about how, uh, he's got china's gotten all these, uh, developing countries"
"10103710","10110670"," Uh, in that the problem is of course, uh, china is left holding the bag and they don't pay anything"
"10110670","10117370"," back So so there is a there it's a it's a two-sided two-edged sword so so, uh It's"
"10117370","10122510"," it was kind of how it even even a little bit more trumpian in that biden seemed to be making"
"10122510","10126070"," up his own facts Which were not in fact facts, right?"
"10126250","10132850"," I mean, he said, uh, china has growth exactly When it was actually 5.5, well, everyone is"
"10132850","10138730"," suspicious of course of chinese numbers But that is quite, uh, quite a, uh, uh, uh, uh, difference"
"10138730","10145610"," Especially when, uh, americ the american growth rate is about what 1.2 1.5 He also made up his"

"10157570","10164130"," how is this different than, um, the sort of bombastic commentary that we constantly got from a"
"10164130","10171150"," president former president trump, you know, I remember you keep him talking about Chinese virus and"
"10171150","10174270"," I mean, yes, uh, that sort of rhetoric rhetoric. "
"10174850","10177830"," Um, how does this how does it coming from biden differ?"
"10178670","10184970"," I'm not sure and that's why i'm a little i worry about it sometimes when when when the president"
"10184970","10189050"," comes out and talks this way And it feels like he's just speaking off the cuff."
"10189850","10197290"," Uh, I just worry that the things will get A combination of certain things may happen and and the"
"10197290","10202830"," same thing that happened under trump may happen again Which is that people will Take him a little"
"10202830","10210450"," too much of his word and go after people they assume are the enemy Uh, so, uh, and these would"
"10210450","10218990"," be their fellow americans So, uh, I worry about things like that and, uh, I'm not sure What the"
"10218990","10227670"," strategy is to speak this way except that the, uh The way american Economic diplomacy has been"
"10227670","10233130"," conducted over the years has basically been it's it's a zero sum game and basically you are the"
"10233130","10237370"," main rival Uh, we're going we're going to destroy you."
"10237530","10245290"," So, uh, so it's and it's not that the Chinese are behaving otherwise But it is that sort of Lack"
"10245290","10248530"," of of feeling that we're all in this together. "
"10248530","10249710"," There's a global economy."
"10250050","10255430"," We should share uh, dan moss in his, uh Column was was very good."
"10255570","10259430"," He said, you know, there's there was this period when everyone was growing at the same time Then"
"10259430","10265950"," suddenly The u.s wanted to recession china had to come in basically it was the chinese colony that"
"10265950","10271510"," buoyed the rest of the world And so now they're it's the other way around Uh, and is the the"
"10271510","10278070"," u.s. Economy is expected to bring everyone along Now to the chinese economy is down and so there"
"10278070","10286470"," we've we've come into what may be a new cycle uh Dan very nicely points out that uh that uh"
"10288290","10295490"," Then when the chinese economy is down Uh, the u.s. Economy has to come in and if it doesn't"
"10295490","10300450"," work out that way then we're all in trouble Well, he was also supposed to be uh more serious"
"10300450","10307550"," president bring some gravitas to the office actually um speak in truths rather than just making up"
"10307550","10314510"," numbers and uh, it's so weird that president biden would say this to a group of His own donors in"
"10314510","10315230"," park city, right?"
"10315390","10321850"," He's not talking to the general electorate Now it's it's it's it's quite surprising that he wasn't"
"10321850","10325850"," aware or the people around him weren't aware to let him know that This was going to get out. "
"10326170","10330470"," Let's let's get to the other to the real cage match I mean we hope it's real right we want"

"10345810","10346750"," Is it gonna happen?"
"10348210","10353310"," You know, I think if they keep on talking this way they'll have to make it happen even though they"
"10353310","10359410"," Even though one or both of them may not eventually want to do it Uh, and you know, I like"
"10359410","10360130"," all these matches. "
"10360710","10364470"," It's a game of of of of cycle Siking each other out."

"10467950","10471910"," you know, do you benefit or suffer from that at upwork?"
"10473290","10474330"," That's a great question."
"10474610","10480130"," I think this is a A long-term trend that's here to stay remote work Uh, the cat is out"
"10480130","10483670"," of the bag and even though a lot of companies are going back into the office Which is great."
"10483910","10488270"," You know, every company is going to find their place On the spectrum of remote work whether it's in"
"10488270","10493950"," office whether it's hybrid or whether it's fully remote Um, the the norms and the capabilities that"
"10493950","10500130"," every company figured out over the pandemic Are things that will serve them well as they now Tap"
"10500130","10505310"," into some variety of remote workers on a platform like ours, you know, we serve the world with"

"10521970","10526650"," So I think this is a long-term trend that's not reversing even though there will be, you know, fits"
"10526650","10531370"," and starts as companies could have navigate, you know, this new normal I have to ask, uh, just"
"10531370","10536590"," quickly about your stock price because it was soaring during the pandemic You were one of the"
"10536590","10537370"," darlings of the markets. "
"10537690","10544650"," It was up Uh to $60 a share a few different times Now it had come back down to earth,"
"10544710","10550270"," but now it's heading back up again Um, it was back down below 10 and now we're up above 14"
"10550270","10553270"," How much do you have to watch this as an agent?"
"10553570","10557950"," I guess of the owners right of the company and um, what's influencing it?"
"10558510","10563210"," You know, we are here building a business for the long term through durable profitable growth And I"
"10563210","10564150"," think that's really the story."
"10564390","10568630"," This is a company that's still in its early innings frankly, you know We went public in 2018 and we"
"10568630","10573850"," are going after a trillion-dollar tam So this is a com tam total addressable market."
"10574210","10574410"," Okay. "

"10589910","10590770"," in its early innings."
"10591030","10594970"," I think that's what's really exciting is we are executing well We're performing well and yet we"
"10594970","10600150"," have a ton of runway ahead of us I mean, I see kind of a discrepancy here right because these"

"10648610","10652590"," through the pandemic because workers figured out that they really want to work this way You know,"
"10652670","10657970"," they are excited to have the freedom the flexibility To do this and we see younger generations of"

"10663390","10668010"," realizing if they want to tap into the workers they need with the skills they need They absolutely"

"10672930","10677010"," into this workforce And certainly as they're looking at things like generative AI, which is a huge"
"10677010","10684090"," and growing category for us We saw these jobs increase a thousand percent In q2 versus q4 Companies"
"10684090","10688210"," that need these types of workers with these types of very current skills have to tap into"

"10694570","10701410"," realized that it was such a massive industry And uh, I talked with somebody who ran a company that"
"10701410","10707210"," that helped to help them administrate their their jobs Um, it's interesting. "
"10707430","10712670"," They make more money than the nurses that are actually installed permanently at the hospital I'm"
"10712670","10718230"," wondering what the freelancers that that you bring in are making I mean My initial thought would be"
"10718230","10722350"," they must not make very much money because they're freelancers But then maybe they do it's the"
"10722350","10723410"," opposite That's amazing."
"10723410","10728270"," This is a this is a very lucrative career And I mean so in AI for example, we're seeing people"

"10739630","10743850"," They know they can't get laid off So this is something where they've got multiple steady clients"
"10743850","10749050"," and it really insulates them from the vagaries of the normal economy Um, and they're earning more."
"10749390","10755690"," Uh, we we've heard from our our talent Frequently they say no amount of money would pay them to go"
"10755690","10759750"," back into a full-time normal job because they make more They have more freedom."
"10759930","10760410"," They're more flexibility. "
"10760670","10764490"," They have control over their schedule So everything about the work arrangement as a freelancer is"

"11332490","11339510"," that uh republicans have been trying to sort of forefront Um, but I think that their hope among"
"11339510","11346790"," democrats had been that hunter biden could kind of sort out his legal problems And put that to an"

"11364910","11370510"," a special counsel investigation can lead Sorry, well, what's what's changed here?"
"11370710","11377150"," I mean, I thought these these investigators have been looking into hunter biden For years, um, is"
"11377150","11388550"," this simply a political move or is this um, maybe maybe to maintain this uh image of Separation"
"11388550","11395310"," between the the administration or is this Um, the uh, do we think that they found something new"
"11395310","11397150"," that they just haven't investigated?"
"11397650","11405850"," I mean, I I still don't think that there has been um enough Uh, material there from all of the"
"11405850","11412290"," investigations that have happened to really prove that something Untoward or or extremely bad"
"11412290","11413330"," happened, right?"
"11413570","11415170"," But there's no proof is going a long way. "
"11415210","11417910"," Is yes I mean, oh, we need just the appearance of impropriety."
"11418150","11422770"," Yes, there's enough to raise the question And the question has been raised repeatedly and there've"
"11422770","11427970"," been investigations I think what the special counsel is a move that you make when There's just been"
"11427970","11434010"," too much question about how you were investigating it For you to credibly continue to say no, we"
"11434010","11440210"," did this All above board and it's sort of a way of insulating yourself from that investigation Then"
"11440210","11444670"," you hand it over to a special counsel You that person goes and takes it and runs with it wherever"
"11444670","11450730"," they're going to go And you may not like where they go, but at least it's no longer your decision"
"11450730","11457050"," And so I'm a little surprised that they took this move, especially now But I think that with the"
"11457050","11462270"," whistleblowers and with just sort of the Uh clear sense that this was going to continue to be a"
"11462270","11469210"," political thing Uh, no matter where the cases went um that this was sort of the best approach to"
"11470010","11475770"," Show the public that like, okay, this is we're not, you know, stacking the deck here This is being"
"11475770","11478710"," fairly investigated So what do we know?"
"11479530","11487690"," That they'll be investigating I mean, he had planned as far as I know on pleading guilty to Uh, a"
"11487690","11493350"," tax evasion charge I don't know if that phrase is too heavy, but not paying taxes for a while and"
"11493350","11499210"," uh or imp or not paying enough and To claiming to be sober when he when he bought a gun"
"11499210","11506510"," in 2018 When he in fact wasn't sober Is that the only thing or is there more Well, I mean"
"11506510","11514170"," keep in mind that like, you know Bill Clinton was impeached over an affair Like as the end result"
"11514170","11519750"," of a special council that was looking into a real estate deal So, you know, the special council can"
"11519750","11524230"," go wherever they think the evidence leads them And as we you know, as we said, like there's a lot"
"11524230","11530490"," of stuff out there that We've heard about that can you know, kind of shady like doesn't look great"
"11531110","11535690"," Maybe doesn't rise to level of criminality, but who knows where where they will go, you know, so"
"11536170","11543230"," The the last thing you want ever Is a special council on your trail because they can turn over any"
"11543230","11549190"," any stone they want and there's really not any Uh And there's not any way to rein them in that's"
"11549190","11554890"," the whole point So So this investigation could go anywhere or it could be that they go They look"
"11554890","11558630"," through all the stuff they had they spent a little bit more time investigating And they could wrap"
"11558630","11564230"," it all up and that has happened before there was a cabinet secretary who was Had a special council"
"11564230","11568290"," and that at the very end of it They basically said yeah, there was nothing here."
"11568430","11571630"," There was never anything here We just you know, we we turned it all over. "
"11571770","11576110"," We looked at all of it and there was nothing So that can also happen Ryan, I want you to"
"11576110","11580870"," stick with us Ryan Teague Beckwith There from Bloomberg news in Washington."
"11581170","11586290"," I want to bring in june graso She's a legal analyst from bloomer television at bloomer radio here"
"11586290","11589730"," with us in the Interactive broker studio june."
"11589910","11597590"," This is No doubt a surprising twist of events and just I think a couple of weeks ago We expected"
"11597590","11600670"," this all to wrap up with a uh plea agreement. "
"11601050","11602130"," What happened to that?"
"11602510","11607510"," Well, hunter biden walked into a delaware courtroom expecting to walk out with a plea agreement and"
"11607510","11612970"," the judge questioned the deal It was very strange first of all because the prosecutors and defense"
"11613530","11618530"," Appeared and they didn't have the details of the deal nailed down and they there was confusion"
"11618530","11625830"," about his whether he was getting full immunity from Any charges or not and the judge noticed that"
"11625830","11631770"," and said go back and come back when you have A deal hammered out when you know what the immunity"
"11631770","11637370"," is that he's getting because hunter biden said well if i'm not getting immunity She asked him Would"
"11637370","11641870"," you agree to this deal if you're not getting immunity from other for other offenses and he said no"
"11641870","11647910"," So it was it was a very odd proceeding from the start and that's where you take a plea agreement"
"11647910","11653870"," for well not Not the only reason but typically a lot of defendants take a plea agreement because"
"11653870","11657050"," they want it to be over and done with and they Want to wipe their hands and walk away?"
"11658090","11664830"," um, how does this work logistically uh from an invest you're moving the investigation from delaware"
"11664830","11670190"," to a special counsel Are there any ways that that the investigation would change?"
"11670870","11676530"," You know, i'm not sure this is so surprising because you know, it's been said time and again That"
"11676530","11681330"," this didn't need to be a special counsel that he had all the powers that he needed So in this"
"11681330","11687830"," case, um, he'll have and you know, he'll have much more resources He can get more people on board"
"11687830","11694950"," and it'll be totally separate from the delaware office Which I think it was anyway But so and he'll"
"11694950","11701750"," have a jurisdiction wider jurisdiction And so he can go and as ryan was saying, you know, think"
"11701750","11709290"," about the um the proceeding that's been going on forever That started under donald trump the"
"11709290","11715530"," special counsel there the durum Which has been going on for years and has it resulted in losses at"
"11715530","11720930"," trial and just one plea agreement So the the problem with the special counsel is they have rope and"
"11720930","11725190"," a lot of them take it and run with it And it goes on and on and on when it"
"11725190","11728590"," should have been wrapped up But this way he'll do a report at the end."
"11728730","11734570"," He You know, allegedly he doesn't have to answer to the attorney general, but from all that was"
"11734570","11741590"," said he wasn't answering Anyway, so I think this is just being done for political purposes really"
"11741590","11749910"," to have the appearance of independence and You know that so that the republicans in congress Well,"
"11750050","11756790"," I'll say can't but are less likely to attack some of the decisions that are made here But as far"
"11756790","11763350"," as you know, what's gone on it's just been a little bit Strange, I'd say and this makes it even"
"11763350","11769890"," more and I mean, you know where there's smoke there's fire in many cases and Even if there's no"
"11769890","11774150"," fire here yet We can agree that there's a lot of smoke, right?"
"11774150","11781170"," I mean, there is a lot of smoke is clearly has clearly attempted to leverage his The powerful"
"11781170","11786750"," position his father is in has for years to make money and for years not even money And I know"
"11786750","11789790"," that's not illegal and many presidents family members have done it in the past, right?"
"11790130","11795230"," But not I don't want to make this what about other people the question is did Have the republicans"
"11795230","11800530"," moved the ball any further and it's something to prove that there was actually some kickbacks for"
"11800530","11806290"," the big guy They haven't that's what they want to prove But they have it and the problem is all"
"11806290","11812070"," the smoke around hunter Biden So this deal that they gave him based on those charges from the"
"11812070","11818330"," attorneys that I've spoken to who are you know Expert in this area that deal wasn't necessarily a"
"11818330","11823030"," sweetheart deal It wasn't in fact some people who were in that position might not have even been"
"11823030","11828590"," prosecuted So they would have made a you know a plea agreement and just not gone to jail like that"
"11828590","11833530"," the tax charges We paid the tax ahead of time and the gun charge is a lot of people don't"
"11833530","11839350"," even get prosecuted on those So it wasn't a sweetheart deal But all the smoke around it and all the"
"11839350","11844030"," republican inquiries and also the whistleblowers who testified that you know There was something"
"11844030","11850050"," wrong with the investigation That all has created a lot of smoke and now it has to be you know"

"12373870","12380510"," the doj has been assigned a special council So we saw uh briefly marrick garland come out and make"
"12380510","12384970"," a statement appointing this special council to oversee the government's ongoing Criminal"
"12384970","12392470"," investigation into president biden's son over his taxes um as well as a number of other issues"
"12392470","12397490"," certainly the republicans hope there will be another number of other issues there We have nick"
"12397490","12398910"," acriman on the phone right now. "
"12399210","12405250"," He's a former assistant special watergate prosecutor And uh nick, you know typically we would talk"
"12405250","12412970"," to you about all things trump um increasingly these Conversations are about the biden family"
"12412970","12417870"," certainly about hunter biden We thought it was all going to be over a couple of weeks ago with a"
"12417870","12420270"," plea agreement and now it's come to this are you surprised?"
"12420910","12422590"," Um not completely."
"12422930","12429090"," I was surprised that the plea didn't go down and the day it was supposed to Um, but since then"
"12429090","12435230"," this is not at all surprising And I think it was pretty clear at that point that um that we"
"12435230","12442470"," would not have taken care of all the other matters Uh that might be under investigation Um, and I"
"12442470","12447810"," think that marrick garland did the right thing Um appointed wise submitted official that he's"
"12447810","12454570"," really a special prosecutor in this thing Um and that he has complete independence Um as he had"
"12454570","12458070"," before and I think it just solidifies that Don't forget."
"12458290","12461030"," He was appointed initially as the us attorney in delaware. "
"12461230","12469830"," Yeah my donald trump Um, so I I think this just you know provides more Distance between the"
"12469830","12474930"," department of justice and the prosecutor But does it give him any extra tools?"
"12475370","12482990"," I I just you know, it seems like an investigation had Had been happening for a long time All the"
"12482990","12487730"," members of the biden administration had had said, you know, marrick garland's given him a bunch of"
"12487730","12495170"," tools whatever he wants Um, but now, you know, the escalation here June grassa was just with us."
"12495290","12499430"," She's a legal analyst at bloombrook law and was saying you know, this looks like political move uh"
"12499430","12504730"," plain and simple Well, I think it's it's part of what marrick garland is done all around."
"12505090","12512390"," I mean he has tried on these types of cases Um that affects the administration and particularly joe"
"12512390","12518190"," biden Um to put make sure that the person who's doing the investigation whether it's jack smith or"
"12518190","12521810"," whether it's vice That they are completely independent. "
"12521810","12529670"," I mean, I think what um garland is trying to do is is basically used the model of archibald cocks"
"12529670","12536510"," who has made the First Watergate special prosecutor where he really had total independence um"
"12536510","12542990"," wasn't answerable to the department of justice And I think that's what marrick garland is trying to"
"12542990","12550610"," set up so that there is complete buffer um between the department of justice and and and joe biden."
"12550730","12556050"," I mean, I think that's really The whole purpose of this is to have somebody in there who is truly"
"12556690","12563150"," Independent and I think this was a way to make it more formalized uh particularly if there are"
"12563150","12570130"," other areas to be investigated now having said that um a question You know what is left to"
"12570130","12576190"," investigate mainly because you've got a statute of limitations that goes for five years and most of"
"12576190","12583130"," these matters and if you take the two uh tax crimes, um They were at a period of time now"
"12583130","12589070"," that's getting beyond A normal statute of limitations for anything probably other than tax crimes."
"12589150","12596130"," So um I just got you know, I I think it's it in some sense is is political to the"
"12596130","12603390"," extent that It it's set up so that there is no Question of politics not being involved. "
"12603810","12608450"," I mean, I think you know to the extent you're saying it's political um having complete independence"
"12608450","12615550"," from the department of justice and from marrick garland um Just adds to the fact that the person"
"12615550","12620570"," has the independent ability to do what he's doing And even though on to this crazy special"
"12620570","12627710"," prosecutor, um Regulation it's supposedly the the special prosecutor ultimately answers to the"
"12627710","12632370"," attorney general I think that marrick garland has been And made it clear that he's been totally"
"12632370","12636990"," hands-off on all of these matters whether it's jack smith or now It's going to be rice."
"12637270","12642030"," I mean frankly Why wouldn't they have been a lot better off if they'd done this from the get-go"
"12642030","12650350"," because the concerns are on the republican side not just the tax crimes or the gun issue, um, but"
"12650350","12658270"," the uh The the sort of foot dragging, uh, you know the the idea that um if the president's son"
"12658810","12664950"," Is a tax evader he can get away with it or he'll be given a lighter sentence Like wouldn't"
"12664950","12670750"," president biden or the administration have been smarter to get this out of the way at the at the"
"12670750","12676910"," beginning Oh, I totally agree with you But I think from marrick garland standpoint Pointing"
"12676910","12684850"," somebody who to investigate this who is a trump appointee as u.s. attorney in delaware Um had the"
"12684850","12690770"," same effect but in some ways it didn't and I think what he's trying to do is emphasize that now"
"12690770","12696690"," it also sends a signal that there are other matters to be investigated He wouldn't be doing this"
"12696690","12701110"," unless There was something more to investigate beyond the tax crime."
"12701390","12708250"," So, um, I think this probably also signals the fact that Um, there's not going to be a plea anytime"
"12708250","12708670"," soon. "
"12709010","12714790"," Um that um, I think that there are other matters that they're looking at And I don't think they're"
"12714790","12720730"," in a position yet to say they're going to put this all behind hunter biden Yeah, I mean so there"
"12720730","12727830"," was this closed door testimony of 100 biden's ex-business partner devin archer And I think the the"
"12727830","12735710"," takeaway from some of the press was that this didn't really um backup the republicans accusing"
"12736590","12743110"," president biden, you know of Crime and corruption Uh, but there were some bits and pieces in there."
"12743250","12748810"," Was there anything there for you that you thought you know this might be potentially the subject of"
"12748810","12755270"," of The uh, probe that could be continued under david wise Yeah, not really."
"12755830","12762370"," I mean it sounded like um hunter biden had his dad call in a couple of times over a long"
"12762370","12769050"," period of time Basically trading off his name but trading off his connection Um, you know a lot of"
"12769050","12775290"," other presidents in the past have had the same problem and Richard nixon did jimmy carter did um,"
"12775290","12782850"," even hillary quinton had this problem with her brother um that relatives, um, you know, if you can"
"12782850","12788910"," pick your friends, but you can't pick your relatives basically and um It's always been something"
"12788910","12796670"," that's bedeviled um presidents and people in high public, you know office Um, so I don't think it"
"12796670","12802650"," really reflected that there was any there there But look the public has to be assured that"
"12802650","12809910"," everything is being done by the book That everything that's out there is being investigated Um, and"
"12809910","12815170"," at the end of the day, I think this will give that assurance You know one he's a special made"
"12815170","12820230"," to special counsel on this and two Um, he was a former trump of pointy. "
"12820410","12827270"," Um, you know republican who was the Delaware u.s attorney who's been kept on Uh, and he's the one"
"12827270","12828150"," investigating it."
"12828270","12835170"," So I really don't see how you can have anybody with any better credentials to do this than rice and"
"12835170","12840270"," um, I think this You know provides exactly what needs to be done."
"12840570","12842570"," Did we find out who the big guy was nick?"
"12842930","12850050"," I mean if in the uh emails that the post got out of the laptop, um In the the quote"
"12850050","12858290"," on the cfc china energy venture when um, they said 10 percent held by h for the big guy Did"
"12858290","12859490"," we ever figure out who that was?"
"12859990","12864690"," Did we lose nick?"

"12876010","12879930"," Well, so far they haven't found any there there, but it doesn't mean that they shouldn't"

"13560910","13563810"," This appointment confirms my commitment to provide mr."

"13574290","13582450"," steps he deems appropriate independently based only on the facts and the law So we're now joined by"
"13582450","13588810"," eric larson bloomberg legal reporter eric thank you so much for joining us on short notice This is"
"13588810","13596710"," very recent news this afternoon Um most basic question on this what is the practical difference now"
"13596710","13602730"," that david wice is a special counsel What does it mean to have a special counsel specifically on"
"13602730","13602930"," this?"
"13603610","13610130"," So the point of having a special counsel like this is to essentially remove Uh this individual uh"
"13610130","13615610"," david wice from the normal chain of command at the justice department So what that does is sort of"
"13615610","13622590"," uh creates um or sort of removes any concerns whether real or perceived About any influence from"
"13622590","13627270"," the biden administration Uh, so so this individual as well."
"13627490","13628890"," It's worth noting david wice."
"13629130","13633950"," He's the u.s. attorney in delaware Uh, who was already overseeing this investigation You know, he"
"13633950","13640170"," was appointed by uh, donald trump when he was president and he was kept on by biden Specifically"
"13640170","13645050"," because this investigation was already on going and he wanted didn't want to give the appearance of"
"13645050","13648230"," trying to Influence the probe into his son. "
"13648490","13655090"," So this gives on mr Wice more independent and he'll be allowed to issue a report at the conclusion"
"13655090","13659690"," of his investigation Uh, and then the justice department will make any decisions or recommendations"
"13660510","13663310"," Do we know roughly when that report would come out?"
"13664010","13669710"," You know, we don't uh, we do know that this investigation has been going on for five years So it's"
"13669710","13675510"," safe to say that a lot of this, uh, you know, investigatory work is probably already done Uh, but"
"13675510","13680710"," we also know that there's a lot of concern, um among republicans in congress and the crit critics"
"13680710","13687130"," of biden And uh his family saying that you know, some of these uh business dealings that hunter"
"13687130","13692190"," biden has been involved in Um could potentially have involved payments to other biden family"
"13692190","13697430"," members and even to the president himself None of that has been concluded This is just suspicion"
"13697430","13699930"," and concerns about republicans at this time."
"13700150","13706070"," So, uh, this will, uh, potentially involve, you know, expanding Investigation, not not sure exactly"
"13706070","13711990"," where she'll go with it, but she clearly has the time and resources now to do what he wants Well,"
"13712090","13717350"," yeah, you you made a point earlier about the process of uh avoiding the appearance of bias But I am"
"13717350","13723590"," curious if we could dig down on on more on this idea of expanding the investigation Uh, does this"
"13723590","13724330"," decision?"
"13724930","13730850"," Tell us anything about if this is bad news for hunter biden or if this is bad news for the"
"13730850","13737650"," president If if this is expanding to any links between them Uh, well, I can't tell you exactly what"
"13737650","13743850"," that what mr White had in mind when he requested to become special counsel it's also worth noting"
"13743850","13750910"," that that was his request Um and that the attorney general granted it Um, so we don't know Exactly"
"13750910","13755610"," what what he has in mind here You know, there's already been doing this investigation for five"
"13755610","13760390"," years, but definitely, you know with an investor Sorry with an election coming up next year."
"13761050","13765770"," Um, you know, it's certainly is that uh, you know a risk for president biden That you know,"
"13765990","13772090"," something else could be uh uncovered or this particular a special counsel, um could issue Uh,"
"13772190","13777730"," something damaging, um, but we also know that this us attorney was overseeing a plea deal with"
"13777730","13782930"," hunter biden Uh, where they were hoping to wrap up this whole investigation and put it to rest Uh,"
"13783290","13789870"," so that plea deal fell apart late last month in court just as hunter biden was prepared to plead"
"13789870","13797530"," guilty to uh, attacked mr meaner Um, the judge had concerns about Uh, the agreement and it sort of"
"13797530","13803930"," fell apart and it sort of had been in limbo up until now Uh, we're not sure exactly what happened"
"13803930","13810430"," in the in the in the meantime, but the us attorney was already prepared to put this case To that"
"13810430","13816090"," and uh, the only reason that uh, we're still here You know, in a way, it's just because that plea"
"13816090","13816770"," deal fell apart. "
"13817090","13823230"," So we'll learn a lot more about this I think when his report comes out I do have to ask"
"13823230","13829210"," a little more about the the plea deal is big news when that fell apart last month Is there is"
"13829210","13829750"," there any chance?"
"13830150","13835230"," I am the legal layman here Is there any chance of a different kind of more clarified plea deal or"
"13835230","13837070"," is that absolutely out the window?"
"13837890","13841310"," Um, I don't I don't see why it would be out out the window."
"13841310","13848390"," I mean the judge made her concerns clear I think that there were some issues with uh, ways that the"
"13848390","13856310"," deal might have restricted court oversight into certain future um elements of the agreement And"
"13856310","13862690"," that's where some of the concerns arose Uh, so it certainly we were expecting that they would be"
"13862690","13866810"," able to come up with some sort of revised deal That they would go back to court and perhaps she"
"13866810","13871870"," would just be guilty and and that would be the end of it But right now that deal, I I"
"13871870","13878570"," would say that the deal is definitely Um very much, uh in jeopardy if this investigation is ongoing"
"13879810","13880950"," Right, eric larson."
"13881250","13885790"," Thank you so much for joining us with the immediate insights on the news about the appointment of a"

"13898570","13904970"," ramifications here because Uh, you you listen to the rhetoric from house republicans and they are"
"13904970","13910890"," looking for a connection between hunter biden and the president Rick, uh, what do you make of"
"13910890","13913210"," today's news in terms of?"
"13913210","13919070"," Does this does this build some sort of bridge between this case and the president himself in any"
"13919070","13919330"," way?"
"13919610","13923610"," You know, it's hard to tell at this stage whether that bridge is is in place. "
"13923630","13929270"," Certainly the house will make good use of this as a way of saying Hey, there's more here, uh, and"
"13929270","13935610"," it kind of takes away the You know two separate lines of justice that donald trump and a lot of"
"13935610","13940510"," house republicans have been using as a political argument I would say we kind of saw this"
"13940510","13944830"," telegraphed I mean, you know part of what screwed up the deal with hunter biden was when they found"
"13944830","13949970"," out that the government still had ongoing Investigations and that the plea deal wasn't the sum"
"13949970","13955430"," total of everything that was going on Legally at the justice department related to hunter biden and"
"13955430","13960790"," and so now all of a sudden it's like oh, we're maybe there was more to it than that It's"
"13960790","13963670"," a bad news item for the president and his political team."
"13964030","13968310"," They're gonna now have to deal with this throughout the entire election cycle Highly unlikely this"
"13968310","13973470"," gets resolved between now and an election day and and and so, you know, it's just it's just another"
"13973470","13976870"," headache They did not need yeah, not great for the president."
"13977130","13983810"," I'm also curious about the I guess political views about David Weiss himself the special counsel I"
"13983810","13990450"," see there's a statement out from congressman jim jordan's Office that's very negative about Weiss"
"13990450","13995830"," noting that he had signed off on the plea deal Republicans in congress were not happy about that"
"13995830","14001590"," genie I know this is an attempt to make it clear that there's not supposed to be any bias no"
"14001590","14006650"," favoritism here Um, but given republicans feelings about David Weiss. "
"14006950","14007970"," Is that even possible?"
"14008490","14014670"," Yeah, I was just looking at that jack he has he has a tweet and you just referenced it Jim"
"14014670","14019410"," jordan the chair of the house judiciary committee saying this is a new way to whitewash the biden"
"14019410","14024850"," family corruption He describes what Weiss had signed off on as a sweetheart deal So if anybody"
"14024850","14030450"," thought this was a gift to the gop and they were going to be content by marek garland doing this"
"14030450","14035650"," They are expressing at least jim jordan is expressing a lot of consternation about what is"
"14035650","14040150"," happening here And I think it speaks to what rick was just talking about because what we had been"
"14040150","14046290"," hearing was they were very frustrated by Weiss after five years Trying to push forward this deal"

"14286070","14291810"," Well, the challenge nationwide whether it's hawai or porterico or the united states mainland, you"
"14291810","14296910"," know, the goal Should be of any community to build a baseline capability that's pretty strong,"
"14297250","14297410"," right?"
"14298030","14303610"," Um, and when the local capability to respond to the disastrous is strong And the state ability to"
"14303610","14308430"," respond to the disastrous is strong Then the federal government should be able to support the gaps,"
"14308470","14314510"," but in this situation everything in the municipality of lahina has wiped out Um, you know,"
"14314510","14319830"," obviously they need all the help that they can get from the state and federal government And hawai"

"14349430","14354350"," set the expectations Uh at this point because a wildfire wiped out all the infrastructure."
"14354730","14359270"," There is nothing left There is nothing really to go back to and if you look at the infrastructure"
"14359270","14364950"," on lahina that's been impacted The ports are gone the comms the communications are down the power"

"14858350","14859150","-to-back administrations."
"14859230","14866030"," What what causes these misunderstandings that you see with regard to the us's approach on china?"
"14866510","14868730"," So let's be clear jack."
"14869210","14877910"," Um, there is a grabby Mercantilism from china and there is an authoritarian Excess from china and"
"14877910","14888110"," both of those things demand a reaction from the united states At the same time my view is that At"
"14888110","14895850"," the moment here in the united states, we view china through a kind of angry red mist We can't get"
"14895850","14904290"," beyond the big dichotomies democracy versus a single party state free markets versus a state"
"14904290","14912870"," dominated economy and as a consequence of that we find it hard to gauge and calibrate the right"
"14912870","14916370"," policy response Let me give you an example of that. "
"14916750","14923610"," Um, a huge focus Here in the united states is on china's intellectual property theft, right?"
"14923990","14930310"," And if you listen to the narrative here in washington dc You would think that china's rise has come"
"14930310","14938230"," mainly maybe even almost exclusively from stealing ip from the united states But look at the top"
"14938230","14945570"," end estimate from the united states government on how much ip theft is costing The top end estimate"
"14945570","14951410"," which is a really flaky hard to support estimate, but let's just go with it for a minute Top end"
"14951410","14959950"," estimate is 600 billion dollars a year Well china is an 18 trillion dollar a year economy So what"
"14959950","14966630"," that means is that based on the us's own top end estimate Theft from theft by china is only"
"14966630","14971150"," accounting for three percent of china's GDP What about the rest of it?"
"14971250","14972150"," What about the other 97?"
"14973750","14982430"," Well that 97 comes from smart policies and hard work by china's policymakers and china's people So"
"14982430","14984550"," what's the best response from the united states?"
"14985110","14991810"," Well Bad behavior by anybody and certainly bad behavior by china demands a response But what should"
"14991810","14994450"," the bigger focus of attention be for the united states?"
"14995350","15001210"," Well, really it should be on getting his own house in order Now you you make a good point on"
"15001210","15007830"," the correct or incorrect response to bad behavior as i read your piece I wondered if maybe the"
"15007830","15015490"," hardest question to answer Is the following you you point out that china sees hypocrisy in the us's"
"15015490","15023790"," tone on Repression whether you're referring to weegers or hong kong But of course, this is not the"
"15023790","15028670"," first repressive action that we've seen from the chinese government And the us doesn't have the"
"15028670","15035650"," same stance toward any repressive Government in the world, but then that raises the question What"
"15035650","15043590"," is the correct response from the us with an eye on the weegers that are in concentration camps Is"
"15043590","15047930"," there a correct response to current repressive activity by the chinese government?"
"15048670","15058130"," So calibrating a china policy Which is true to us values And also"
"15058130","15068530"," keeps broader strategic objectives in place is tough to do Right is really not an easy task um At"
"15068530","15075790"," the same time I don't think that united the united states does itself any favors When it casts the"
"15075790","15084730"," relationship with china in terms of a manatee and struggle between good and evil um when we have"
"15084730","15092730"," remarks along the lines of China is a dictatorship When we have remarks along the lines of china"

"15100070","15107870"," compromise You don't leave any space for strategic reassurance All you're really doing is buying a"
"15107870","15113830"," little bit of popular support in the united states And trump demonstrated how powerful that can be"

"17244110","17248450"," course for that But is there an investment case to be made right now around that?"
"17251710","17257850"," Well, I I think there is a case for three percent inflation going forward plus or minus and I I"
"17257850","17263590"," think if we got to that point then the fed would begin to consider stopping and maybe even Lowering"
"17263590","17271230"," rates over the next Year or so, but I I do think that the tenure at 415 now You know,"
"17271370","17278150"," it is probably overvalued and has been overvalued for a long time in terms of a lower yield Um and"
"17278150","17279210"," too high a price. "
"17279730","17287490"," Um, you know, if fed funds Actually came down to two and a half or three percent You know the"
"17287490","17293590"," ten-year term premium that is the spread between uh, ten years and fed funds typically has been"
"17293590","17301070"," about 135 basis points over a long period of time So, you know, if you had 135 basis points to"
"17301070","17306130"," two and a half or even three percent on fed funds You get to a point where we are now"
"17306130","17312290"," and that suggests that all of the bulls on Treasuries and on the ten year and maybe even on the"
"17312290","17315970"," long one Um, I think their arguments are a little misplaced."
"17316410","17322150"," I think it's been overvalued for a long time and we're going back to Proper valuation on longer"
"17322150","17328210"," term notes and bonds I mean you understand better than anybody that relationship between what's"
"17328210","17332750"," going on with inflation and the fed And how that sort of factors into some of these bullish calls"
"17332750","17337290"," and those bull calls have really started to increase Not just because of the two reports that we"
"17337290","17343110"," got this week bill If they do have it wrong here kind of give us a sense here of why"
"17343110","17353110"," specifically Well, I think the they got it wrong First of all because rates were so low"
"17353110","17359310"," because of quantitative easing and the fact that You know, in some cases the five-year real yield"
"17359310","17367470"," was a minus 200 basis points, which sounds incredible, but it was a year and a half ago and It's"
"17367470","17369730"," now a plus 200 basis points."
"17370030","17375690"," So if 100 basis points switch in terms of real rates So I I think investors simply got overwhelmed"
"17375690","17381250"," with the fact that the fed would stay low and stay low for a long time And that inflation wouldn't"
"17381250","17387930"," pop its head out of the out of the rabbit hole It has and and so now we're moving back"
"17387930","17390310"," into a an old age world. "
"17390310","17400230"," I suppose in which You know interest rates really are Are are a sign of a healthy economy"
"17400230","17407490"," and The way we have it now the negative yield curve and we've had that for 12 18 months."
"17407730","17415050"," I suppose You know a thriving economy a thriving finance based economy can't do well Doesn't mean"
"17415050","17422870"," it Goes down in the dust but it can't do well if You know low risk investments yield more than"
"17422870","17429330"," high risk investments and as you march out from the You know the 30-day bill to You know the"
"17429330","17435710"," 30-year bond You can see that you Are better off the old ones in terms of the 30-year"

"17445650","17450310"," the economy going forward Well, you make the point that higher rates are a sign of a healthy"
"17450310","17454510"," economy And I want to talk a little bit more about real yields because I was just going through the"
"17454510","17461030"," screens If you look at 30-year Real yields they're knocking on the door of 2 percent We haven't"
"17461030","17467450"," been there for well over a decade What message do you take away from that this fantastic run-up"
"17467450","17477170"," that we've seen specifically in real yields Well, it's a message that That the economy and"
"17477170","17485750"," inflation in particular Should be slowing down and has to slow down If inflation is to be contained"
"17485750","17492270"," it's a 2 percent real yield for I don't think it's that high for 30s But for fives and close"
"17492270","17494030"," to that for tens is that too high?"
"17494370","17501110"," Yeah, it probably is on a longer-term basis, but you know, it's been deemed necessary I guess to to"

"17507990","17516610"," going forward of real yields as Paul Volcker showed us, you know, are the Are this are the solution"
"17517400","17524010"," To slower economic growth to lower inflation and I think Volcker, I think You know, the current"
"17524010","17533270"," chairman Powell is He's trying to replicate what Paul Volcker did He just to slay the inflation"
"17533270","17538190"," dragon not in the same way and not to the same magnitude that Volcker had to do But he's trying"
"17538190","17547450"," to be the the Volcker number two going forward You know 12 to 24 months in the future Bill, I"
"17547450","17553530"," promise you I'm looking at the 30-year real yield right now at 1.95 I'll I'll be you the"

"17555710","17561250"," It's been shocking I want to go back to nominal yields though and talk about fair value because I"
"17561250","17565610"," follow your twitter pretty closely And of course you tweeted last week that you're overall bearish"
"17565610","17569270"," On 10-year yields we've talked about how you look at the 10-year right now. "
"17569370","17577490"," It's at About let's see 4.16 percent Where is fair value at what level would you get comfortable"
"17577490","17579110"," stepping into duration here?"
"17581170","17590110"," Well, I think at higher levels around Four and a half is a good technical stopping point You know"
"17590110","17595230"," what we've seen this week kitty in in terms of supply We've seen a hundred billion in supply you"
"17595230","17603690"," mentioned that Three 10 and 30 are bonds the first two options went well the 30 year did not But"
"17603690","17609550"," we can expect I think going forward based upon the fiscal situation and a trillion and a half"
"17609550","17618870"," dollar deficit to see a supply in terms of longer dated Treasures of maybe a trillion more than we"
"17618870","17627510"," saw in the previous 12 months So it's supply and addition to the fact in my view that the 10"
"17627510","17632850"," year You know began the year at a Much too low a level."
"17633070","17638850"," I would point out to that other markets the bull market in germany and the gilt market in the uk"
"17639310","17650770"," they're all at basically cyclical"
"17650770","17657770"," Now we know Something about japan we don't know exactly what their intentions are but it seems all"
"17657770","17663610"," major Central banks are moving in the same direction and all major On markets are moving that way"
"17663610","17663930"," too."
"17664170","17669050"," So I I think the 10 year treasury at four and a half percent might be some might be some"
"17669050","17674430"," value but The bill is certainly not at this at this level But bill when we look at sort of"
"17674430","17678590"," I guess what real rates are telling us and you put that I guess against the backdrop of the"
"17678590","17683850"," increase in treasury supply What most people expect to increase further and of course the potential"
"17683850","17686450"," for additional Fiscal money coming through the pipeline. "
"17686470","17688530"," Does that distort the message that we're getting?"
"17691570","17699070"," I think to some extent, I mean like I suggested the the real yields That's sorry katie on the 30"
"17699070","17699330"," year."
"17699510","17703810"," I guess you're more right than I am in terms of being close to 2 percent So they're all close"
"17703810","17710430"," to 2 percent Historically, you know, those levels have been enough have been enough to bring down"
"17711270","17716230"," In inflation they were higher than that during the Volcker period, although it was harder to"
"17716230","17724010"," measure because it didn't have tips, but You know 2 percent real Is a It's a substantially"
"17724010","17735430"," restrictive Rate and I I think once You know this 500 billion or 1 trillion Push"

"17745310","17751750"," ago I think once that's used up that we're going to start to see the effect of a 2 percent"
"17751750","17759290"," real rate on Consumers and consumption going forward therefore lower real GDP and therefore"
"17759290","17766910"," inflation in my view around 3 percent Alright, you've been listening to a special conversation with"

"17862490","17872410"," I understand the former president is not supposed to discuss Sensitive That's"
"17872410","17877430"," right, you know, typically in a criminal case The government will ask for what's known as a"
"17877430","17880910"," protective order And this is a pretty standard part of cases."
"17881290","17887410"," It just means, you know The parties and the lawyers can't Take a lot of the evidence to have trial"
"17887410","17892610"," and share it with the public You know, it makes sure that witnesses aren't placed in jeopardy and"
"17892610","17898090"," sort of the integrity of the trial is maintained And the fight here had been over You know, how"
"17898090","17903750"," much of the evidence in this case would be covered by those kinds of restrictions and trump and his"
"17903750","17908950"," lures It already agreed for instance that information about you know secret grand jury proceedings"
"17908950","17916310"," Um, you know things that were obviously Sensitive quote unquote that was not an issue But they did"
"17916310","17921690"," want to have the government, you know, clearly state what it believed was sensitive in for instance"
"17921690","17928590"," witness interviews And then everything else could potentially be discussed On air on the campaign"
"17928590","17935630"," trail wherever By the former president and his attorney So, you know, it wasn't any specific"
"17935630","17942010"," category of of evidence that's specified in court But it's more sort of broad strokes Whether or"
"17942010","17947770"," not, you know All of it is considered off limits or whether you know, he has some leeway to talk"
"17947770","17953110"," about what he's getting from the government Well, and of course zoe trump on true social for"
"17953110","17957490"," example Have said that a protective order would violate his right to free speech Which is the same"

"17962990","17966790"," when it goes to trial was that the president the former president had a right to say the things He"
"17966790","17967310"," was saying etc. "
"17967910","17972850"," It's noteworthy to me that judge chutkin in this hearing Said that while the former president does"
"17972850","17978230"," have a first amendment right to free speech that right is quote not Absolute and I just wonder if"
"17978230","17985190"," that also has implications ultimately for his wider defense You know, it's it's not unexpected that"

"18008650","18014130"," seated in the case And so, you know, she said that she was mindful of the first amendment"
"18014770","18019850"," Implication and did have to take those into consideration That was sort of pushing back on the"
"18019850","18027350"," government a bit Um, but ultimately, you know, her job is not to worry about You know what it means"
"18027350","18034230"," for Trump's campaign is what she has said to them Zoe i'm curious Can they hold the former"
"18034230","18039150"," president to this or what happens if he decides he doesn't want to cooperate and he just starts"
"18039150","18045930"," posting everything on truth social Sure, so separate from this protective order as a condition of"

"18049570","18055690"," He already had to agree that he wouldn't do anything that would jeopardize Witness security or you"
"18055690","18060830"," know, the the integrity of the case and that the judge noted that was even broader Than any"
"18060830","18066450"," restrictions that she would place on what evidence he could or could not talk about Um, you know"
"18066450","18072410"," what we've seen in other high-profile cases is judges starting out with you know warnings Sort of"
"18072410","18079350"," informal Admissions to parties to say listen, you know, i'm not going to tell you you can't say xy"

"18084990","18085690"," she's done here."

"18091490","18099110"," that is a clear problem and the government can you know ask for additional restrictions But if the"
"18099110","18104110"," judge, you know sees things happening out in public if the government brings them to her attention"

"18204570","18210050"," Sure, so practically what it means is that dave advice is no longer subject to the normal chain of"
"18210050","18215510"," command That would have him answering to political appointees at the justice department This is a"
"18215510","18221490"," step that's normally done in situations where you know the attorney general has to be concerned"

"18732070","18736770"," really well surprisingly Like that will completely change the landscape and we've seen that before"
"18736770","18741910"," and that's one of the things that those very early states can do Which is just completely overnight"

"19494970","19500490"," I think once that's used up that we're going to start to see the effect of a 2% real"
"19500490","19504550"," rate on consumers and consumption going forward. "
"19504550","19510770"," Therefore, lower real GDP and therefore inflation in my view, around 3%."

"19516450","19520710"," The Dow right now, up 3-tenths of a percent, 113 points now. "
"19520890","19522610"," The S&P 500 pretty much flat."
"19523250","19527690"," It had been lower than NASDAQ still down, but less than before, down only about 5-tenths of a"
"19527690","19530490"," percent now down about 71 points."
"19530490","19532770"," You hold it on the tenure every time I check in. "
"19533050","19534950"," It goes higher, just won a little bit higher again."
"19535150","19538250"," 4.162% now."

"19543770","19547870"," 9x crude up about 4-tenths of a percent at 83-18 a barrel."
"19548430","19549850"," And that is a Bloomberg Business Flash. "
"19550470","19556550"," You're listening to Bloomberg Sound On with Joe Matthew and Kaylee Lyons on Bloomberg Radio."
"19557830","19561970"," Plenty of China news and analysis to discuss today."
"19562270","19567650"," I'm Jack Fitzpatrick from Bloomberg government sitting in for Joe Matthew here co-hosting with"
"19567650","19568590"," Kaylee Lyons. "
"19568950","19571570"," And Kaylee, I am struck by the back and forth."
"19571590","19579130"," What appears to be a careful approach yesterday toward China with a seemingly scaled back executive"
"19579130","19581190"," order on investment issues."
"19581190","19588950"," But also some kind of glib comments about China's economy referring to it as a ticking time bomb by"
"19588950","19592230"," President Biden shooting from the hip recently. "
"19592970","19599890"," And we are joined now by David Weston, host of Wall Street Week, who I understand also spoke to"
"19599890","19601530"," Deborah Lair at the Paulson Institute."
"19601890","19607650"," David, how do you make sense of the back and forth between hot and cold with regard to the"
"19607650","19609170"," president's stance on China?"
"19609170","19610530"," Well, it's great to be with you."
"19610790","19616350"," You know, as I heard once that faux pas in Washington is when you speak the truth by accident. "
"19617470","19619250"," And you have to wonder about comments like this."
"19619350","19622410"," You have to bear in mind, of course, he was appearing before fundraisers."
"19622950","19624710"," He was trying to raise money out there in Utah. "
"19625630","19628250"," And I wonder whether it's positioning him for the election."
"19628490","19631350"," We did talk to Deborah Lair, who spent a lot of time in China with Hank Paulson."
"19631450","19635090"," She's the vice chair of his foundation as well as working at Edelman Global Advisory. "
"19635090","19641150"," And I asked her among other things about what she made of these comments and what it said very"
"19641150","19645710"," specifically about where the respective parties may well be on China coming up to the next"
"19645710","19645970"," election."
"19646370","19647070"," This is what she said."
"19647310","19653030"," China has always been a focus in election campaigns, and it will be again this year in a very"
"19653030","19653630"," heated way. "
"19653910","19658750"," I'm sure both sides are looking to see how tough they can be when it comes to China."
"19659310","19665730"," What we hope is in the context of looking at being tough on China, we remain laser focused on what"
"19665730","19670870"," we need to be doing to ensure that the United States remains competitive and that we're doing"
"19670870","19676690"," things that don't isolate our companies, but instead ensure that they remain competitive because,"
"19676690","19681590"," after all, our economic security is what underpins our national security."
"19682070","19684350"," Yeah, that's Deborah Lair, the Edelman Global Advisory. "
"19685070","19688450"," And the thing that, actually, when I heard about this first thing this morning, Jack and Kayleigh,"
"19688530","19693250"," I thought about, and you won't remember this, I barely do, when John Kennedy was running for"
"19693250","19698430"," President Nixon, he came out early to make sure he was to the right of Nixon on Russia, on the"
"19698430","19702730"," Soviet Union, and I wondered whether this was actually President Biden making sure he was to the"
"19702730","19706550"," right, if I can use that expression, of whoever runs for the Republicans on China."
"19707150","19712270"," Yeah, I'm very curious, especially David, because you mentioned earlier he did make these comments"
"19712270","19720210"," on the Chinese economy at a fundraiser where you often, I guess you get less scripted comments, but"
"19720210","19727810"," I'm curious if we can chalk this up to sort of a Joe Biden accidental gaff kind of thing, or"
"19727810","19733910"," is this a natural outgrowth of a political pressure that is multiple administrations deep?"
"19734130","19737490"," I mean, do we have a clear answer on the motivations there in your view?"
"19737690","19742290"," Well, certainly, I can't get him inside the President's mind at all, and I don't know that he ever"
"19742290","19747870"," wanted this to come out in this way, but I think at the very least what it does indicate is"
"19747870","19752770"," his state of mind and where he wants to communicate to the people who are giving him money where he"
"19752770","19755190"," is on China, and that is, I'm going to be really tough on China."
"19755370","19756430"," That's the way at least I read it. "
"19756650","19759250"," He doesn't want the Republicans to come in and say, you're soft on China."
"19760270","19765510"," Well, it's so interesting to me, David, that words are words, obviously, action is action, and"
"19765510","19770090"," maybe he's being a little less careful with some of the specific wording than the administration is"
"19770090","19775510"," being very intentional with the specific action, like this executive order, which was quite narrow"
"19775510","19776030"," in scope."
"19776030","19782970"," High fence for small yard is what they're calling it, and maybe that's a good thing for investors. "
"19783310","19787690"," I mean, I wonder how Wall Street should be looking at this very careful strategy when it comes to"
"19787690","19787910"," China?"
"19788550","19790070"," Well, I think that's a great point, Kayleigh."
"19790330","19793990"," I'm sure investors will look at what he's doing much more than what he's saying."
"19794490","19802230"," At the same time, this was, again, going back to John Kennedy, you remember he got really to the"
"19802230","19806090"," right of Nixon on Soviet Union, and then what did he do once he got an office?"
"19806450","19807070"," He did the pay of pigs. "
"19807350","19811590"," And the question is, is it possible for a candidate, to some extent, to pay themselves in a corner"
"19811590","19818390"," on policy, so they have to be tough once they get reelected, and it really affects policy in that"
"19818390","19818570"," respect."
"19818750","19823750"," I mean, some people might suggest that having with Saudi Arabia with candidate Joe Biden, when he"
"19823750","19826650"," got an office, he had taken such a strong position on Saudi Arabia."
"19826650","19827610"," He almost had no choice. "
"19828150","19833430"," Yeah, I'm curious of the degree to which the politics drive the policy and maybe policy mistakes."
"19833430","19839930"," I spoke earlier with Tom Orlick, Bloomberg Chief Economist, who made a case in a piece this morning"
"19839930","19848110"," that there seems to be, I guess, a false idea that there's this binary choice between China either"
"19848110","19853410"," collapsing or taking over the world, that a lot of the political rhetoric is almost cartoonishly"
"19853410","19853810"," binary."
"19855030","19862190"," David, I mean, is this a case in which the politics have led policy makers to oversimplify the"
"19862190","19862850"," issues there?"
"19862850","19863930"," Well, we all do. "
"19864050","19867390"," I mean, I want to say, I think we in the media sometimes oversimplify too, so I'm not going to"
"19867390","19868970"," point too many fingers at people."
"19869230","19872290"," I'm sure that you're right, but I also want to take a half step back."
"19872730","19876070"," China has its own struggles right now without regard to the United States. "
"19876310","19880430"," Whatever our position is, whatever our policy is, they're facing, President Xi is facing a lot of"
"19880430","19882070"," challenges that we went over with Deborah Lair."
"19882770","19886970"," And he's got a long way to go to really get his economy going again."
"19887590","19891230"," And it's not clear exactly how quickly or effectively he can do that. "
"19891230","19896370"," I think that maybe in some ways the larger issue for investors, because obviously a China that"
"19896370","19898290"," isn't growing is not good for the global economy."
"19898970","19899070"," Yeah."
"19899270","19903750"," And so China's economy, obviously, is a very sensitive issue for Beijing. "
"19904250","19909230"," Speaking of sensitive issues, some like the economy of China, President Biden speaks on."
"19909670","19912770"," Other sensitive issues, he is more reluctant to do so."
"19912950","19914510"," One of those, David, being his son. "
"19914690","19919330"," I know, I feel like every Friday you come on sound on and we ask you to put on your"
"19919330","19919970"," lawyer hat."
"19920450","19927010"," I'd like to do so again, just given the news of today, a special counsel being appointed in the"
"19927010","19929170"," investigation into his son, Hunter Biden."
"19929710","19934770"," This is actually just the U.S. attorney in Delaware who already was investigating him now being"
"19934770","19935890"," given this designation. "
"19936770","19938770"," As an attorney, how consequential is this?"
"19939070","19943850"," Jack was asking one of our legal reporters about this earlier, but do you think it's going to be"
"19943850","19947230"," enough to be satisfactory for some of the critics of the Justice Department in this matter?"
"19947230","19949970"," Well, you should tell me what the legal reporters say, because I don't want to get crosswise of our"
"19949970","19950570"," legal reporters."
"19950830","19953990"," But I was watching Merrick Garland, with whom I clerked, you know, for a couple of years."
"19954490","19957870"," I've known him quite well in the past as he made that announcement. "
"19958290","19959670"," And I thought two things right away."
"19960110","19965690"," One is this is really proof positive of what he, and to be frank, President Biden has been saying,"
"19965850","19967710"," which is he is independent of the White House."
"19968050","19971890"," This can't be something that the White House was urging or wanted or wanted to tolerate. "
"19972310","19974850"," But he was proving he is independent of the White House."
"19974850","19980430"," And now the Special Counsel, Jack Smith, is even more independent, because he's really out from"
"19980430","19982630"," under to a large degree, Merrick Garland himself."
"19983230","19988330"," And I am afraid for the President, because it will not be fun for him. "
"19988530","19990570"," I think this means it's not going away anytime soon."
"19990970","19994870"," The one thing we have experienced with Special Counsel is once you appoint him, they keep going."
"19995270","19995550"," Right. "
"19995730","20001890"," Even if it's not a massive expansion of the investigation, this is not a scaling back of the"
"20001890","20002410"," investigation."
"20002410","20006250"," David Weston, thank you so much for joining us, host of Wall Street Week."
"20006770","20008530"," Great insights on China policy. "
"20009390","20011050"," Merrick Garland being very careful."
"20011210","20016090"," You know who hasn't been careful lately is Paul Krugman with his predictions of the alien war and"
"20016090","20017970"," the inflation that apparently will come out."
"20018450","20021590"," We're going to wrap up with some weird stuff on that. "
"20022170","20024270"," But for now, I'm Jack Fitzpatrick."

"20368940","20369660"," Thanks, Jack. "
"20369980","20370460"," You mentioned it."
"20370580","20374440"," The investigation into the President's son, Hunter Biden, is now entering a new phase."
"20374780","20379760"," The U.S. Attorney, who's been handling the investigation into the President's son, David Weiss, is"
"20379760","20383080"," being appointed as a special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland. "
"20384060","20391220"," On Tuesday of this week, Mr. Weiss advised me that in his judgment, his investigation had reached a"
"20391220","20397800"," stage at which he should continue his work as a special counsel, and he asked to be so appointed."
"20398980","20405080"," Upon considering his request, as well as the extraordinary circumstances relating to this matter, I"
"20405080","20409640"," have concluded that it is in the public interest to appoint him as special counsel."
"20409940","20414220"," With Garland's appointment, Weiss will now be able to operate outside the normal chain of command. "
"20414920","20419900"," The federal judge overseeing the election conspiracy case against Donald Trump is going with a"
"20419900","20425060"," defense request for less restrictive rules on sharing evidence than prosecutors wanted, but Judge"
"20425060","20430680"," Tanya Chutt can also make clear, Trump, like every American, has a First Amendment right to speech,"
"20431240","20432900"," but that right is not absolute."
"20433320","20436860"," She warns she will take whatever measures are necessary to protect the proceedings."
"20437860","20442240"," Hawaiian officials say they still do not have a firm number of those missing following the wildfire"
"20442240","20447660"," that has caused massive destruction on the island of Maui that was fueled by drought conditions and"
"20447660","20448740"," hurricane force winds. "
"20449440","20450960"," The death toll is now up to 55."
"20451500","20455580"," Bloomberg Climate Reporter Eric Rosten says what happened on Maui is highly unusual."
"20455980","20458600"," Thirdly, the scale is unprecedented. "
"20458840","20462820"," It's the worst natural disaster Hawaii has seen."
"20463260","20472980"," It's essentially, I hope not, but it could surpass a 2018 California fire as the deadliest fire"
"20472980","20476760"," in U.S. history."
"20476760","20479640"," It's the first time in the years to determine the role that climate change played in that disaster. "
"20480420","20485580"," Global news 24 hours a day powered by more than 2,700 journalists and analysts in over 120"

"20487120","20489140"," Nancy Lyons, now back to you, Jack and Kaley."
"20489640","20490880"," Thank you so much, Nancy. "
"20491280","20494440"," Jack Fitzpatrick here wrapping things up in this hour with Kaley Lyons."
"20495180","20501580"," So the Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman was on the latest episode of the Odd Lots podcast."
"20502040","20504720"," Of course, you can download that anywhere you get your podcasts. "
"20505460","20510940"," And he seemed very confident in his prediction of what economically would happen if there is an"
"20510940","20511860"," alien invasion."
"20512220","20514060"," We bring you the freshest analysis here."
"20514180","20515220"," Let's play Krugman's comments. "
"20515880","20517680"," And uncontested alien invasion."
"20517940","20520780"," I guess it kind of depends on how they run the occupation."
"20521120","20525460"," But the, but actual wars are always inflationary. "
"20525560","20527440"," I can't think of one that wasn't."
"20527440","20532440"," Kaley is quite confident that if they, if they arrive, we are going to war with the aliens."
"20532440","20535560"," I have so much to say about this. "
"20535940","20537100"," This is a Nobel Laureate."
"20537180","20538740"," So we should take his words seriously."
"20539960","20543540"," But I guess my question is what kind of aliens are we talking about?"
"20544160","20545820"," Why would we have to go to war with them?"
"20545900","20546760"," What if we could be friends?"
"20547020","20548940"," I have to disagree with him. "
"20549040","20550040"," I think we'd be friends."
"20550340","20551340"," We'd establish trade."
"20551840","20553400"," Whatever brought them all the way here. "
"20553560","20557800"," They must have a lot of minerals or electricity generations generation."
"20558040","20559440"," And I think it would be disinflationary."
"20559440","20562020"," I think we'd have a big supply boost. "
"20562800","20564760"," It could be copper or lightweight metal."
"20565020","20565820"," Whatever happens."
"20566300","20571120"," I, I want a full debate with Paul Krugman about the inflationary or disinflationary effects. "
"20571640","20572580"," I would buy a ticket."
"20572840","20573040"," Yes."
"20573300","20576240"," I'll go on for the full hour on that topic. "
"20576240","20578800"," But thank you again to our guests."
"20579280","20581140"," This, these past two hours."

"20606240","20608000"," So much for a slow summer Friday. "
"20608220","20608760"," No, no."
"20609020","20613640"," And thanks again to Brock Long, the former FEMA administrator for walking us through the response"

"20658060","20662860"," I'm Carol Masser along with our Bloomberg News Deputy Team Leader for US Securities."
"20663100","20665420"," Just meant Tim is actually off today."
"20665940","20667720"," And, you know, a lot going on. "
"20667780","20670580"," Although I'm kind of just a little lost because I was listening about the aliens."
"20670980","20671160"," Yes."
"20671480","20672260"," From sound on. "
"20672820","20673300"," It was so entertaining."
"20673680","20677720"," It's so funny when I said to be so like my family brought up because they know I'm in the"
"20677720","20679280"," news world and they're like, what do you think about these aliens?"
"20679280","20683800"," I'm a little worried about climate change right now and some other things."
"20684200","20685020"," So, yeah. "
"20685460","20687280"," It's something that really grabs your attention."
"20687660","20687960"," It does."
"20688340","20690660"," You know, you bring up the alien and like, you know, we're like, what?"
"20691420","20693240"," Anyway, it is Friday, August 11th. "
"20693260","20696200"," We're getting ready to wrap up the trading day in the trading week."
"20696600","20700280"," I will say it's been another interesting day and I do feel like we have been saying this every day"
"20700280","20705580"," where we kind of get one maybe trend, if you will, at the open coming off an economic report or"
"20705580","20706120"," something else."
"20706280","20707420"," And then we kind of dial back. "
"20707680","20713420"," It's safe to say if there's a trend, a theme, I feel like it's a reminder that, yep, inflation is"
"20713420","20717000"," way down from a year ago, but the Fed's probably still on an inflation fight."
"20717240","20720960"," And I have to say one of the particular sectors I've been keeping close eye on is energy."
"20721320","20725140"," Just continuing to outperform after being one of the amongst the losers this year and especially"
"20725140","20728980"," when you're looking at some of these ETF outflows hitting extreme some people wondering potentially"
"20728980","20730720"," is that a contrarian level just yet. "
"20730720","20732140"," So keeping an eye on that, Carol."
"20732300","20736300"," Alright, so we're going to talk about energy probably with our TV guys too as well as we break down"
"20736300","20736580"," the trade."
"20736720","20742420"," But I do want to get into because of the treasury trade in particular because we are seeing a"
"20742420","20744860"," stocks kind of bounce around but definitely off their highs in the session. "
"20744980","20746340"," We do have yields higher."
"20746760","20750280"," We're going to talk about the inflation fight still on it as we saw in this morning's PPI report."
"20750580","20755780"," We're also going to get into the ticking time bomb, not really the way to endear yourself if you"
"20755780","20762780"," will to a country or to someone if you will, but President Biden kind of saying that the U.S."
"20762820","20765840"," and China political and economic relationship definitely on our radar. "
"20766040","20766960"," And then we're going to talk retail earnings."
"20767220","20769600"," Ernie's Walmart target next week home depot."
"20769940","20772260"," So that's key focus heading into next week. "
"20772280","20776220"," And then also we're going to be speaking with the founder and CEO of the blockchain company Paxos,"
"20776220","20778580"," which is behind PayPal's new stablecoin."
"20778780","20779440"," He'll stop by later."
"20779620","20780900"," That was a big story this week. "
"20780980","20784860"," But I had a lot of questions for him because I still have problems just with calling things a"
"20784860","20786420"," stablecoin because I ain't so stable."
"20786760","20787780"," It's a great point, Carol."
"20788160","20788560"," All right. "
"20788660","20789360"," So we're going to talk about that."
"20789500","20792000"," We're going to get into the lazy girl jobs."
"20792120","20794080"," That's a new career trend, if you will. "
"20794820","20798620"," And we're also going to talk with Yannick Benjamin back with us, co-founder of Wine on Wheels and"
"20798620","20799280"," Contento Restaurant."
"20800920","20805180"," OE's so inspirational, but also I just love all the worlds that he's playing in."
"20805240","20806220"," And we're going to drink a little wine. "
"20806460","20807360"," So it's fine, everybody."
"20808080","20808340"," All right."
"20808400","20808680"," Right now. "
"20808820","20810020"," Let's head over to our TV team."
"20810120","20810760"," Countdown to the close."
"20811000","20812000"," It starts right now. "
"20813700","20814960"," Countdown to the close."
"20816020","20821580"," Bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform coverage ahead of the U.S. market close starts right now."
"20822440","20824100"," This is the countdown to the close. "
"20824600","20826440"," Romaine Bostik alongside Katie Greifel."
"20826620","20831220"," Join right now by our colleagues, Carol Massehr and Jess Metten filling in today for Tim Stenovic."
"20831220","20833740"," Welcome to our audiences across all of our Bloomberg platforms. "
"20834360","20837020"," Carol Massehr, we're closing out the Friday afternoon here."
"20837340","20838260"," A somewhat down note."
"20838420","20842320"," I interesting the one bright spot, at least as far as a major indices, it's actually the Dow Jones"
"20842320","20842980"," industrial average. "
"20843140","20843640"," What's up with that?"
"20843760","20844940"," Does everybody care about the Dow anymore?"
"20845540","20845880"," Yes."
"20846400","20847080"," I just said it."
"20847680","20849480"," Oh, because Romaine says it. "
"20849720","20850080"," Wow."
"20850540","20851740"," We are living in Romaine's world."
"20851880","20854140"," No, I think it's interesting that we have been talking about the Dow. "
"20854300","20855480"," Wait, can someone cut that clip?"
"20855820","20858000"," I'm just going to play it every time."
"20858280","20859420"," No, it's the ether."
"20859760","20859980"," It's gone. "
"20860540","20862260"," What's interesting, we've talked a lot about the Dow."
"20862520","20864560"," I feel like this past month or so."
"20864560","20868120"," So what does that say about rotation or emphasis by investors?"
"20868580","20873040"," Having said that, once again, we were focusing on another inflation print, and this time it was the"
"20873040","20875100"," producer side of the inflation story. "
"20875260","20878500"," We got that this morning picking up, boost from services."
"20880260","20881300"," So what's the verdict?"
"20881840","20882520"," Well, I don't know."
"20882680","20885920"," I think what's interesting, Neil Dada, I know we've all been talking about Neil, but others have"
"20885920","20888060"," said too, freight rates are bottoming. "
"20888340","20889580"," We've seen oil prices pick up."
"20889700","20893120"," So is it just a reminder that the Fed ultimately has to be vigilant?"
"20893640","20897800"," And I was speaking with Jillian Wolf over at Bloomberg Intelligence who crunches the numbers when"
"20897800","20900480"," we always talk about margins right in what this means for corporate America."
"20900480","20904840"," So the spread between producer prices and consumer prices, it came down a little bit. "
"20904980","20909820"," But overall, if you look over the past year, still very much in positive territory that should give"
"20909820","20913200"," you some indication that when we're looking at earnings, there's potentially still brighter times"
"20913200","20913400"," ahead."
"20913540","20917660"," Yeah, I feel like the takeaway from the PPI combined with the CPI from the day before is that kind"
"20917660","20920940"," of like we don't know anything because I feel like the CPI was definitely encouraging."
"20921260","20921820"," But I don't know. "
"20921940","20925720"," I mean, for all those folks who are positive about this PPI report, there was a lot in there on"
"20925720","20926460"," the services side."
"20926620","20928160"," We're just like, this is a disinflation."
"20928560","20929060"," No, exactly. "
"20929560","20930200"," Yeah, I agree with."
"20930380","20930840"," Yeah, sorry."
"20930920","20932120"," No, I was just going to say you had it all together. "
"20932320","20937300"," I think the bond market is pretty set on their pricing that even if the Fed, maybe they hike again,"
"20937300","20940320"," maybe they don't, but they're going to be on hold for a while."
"20940540","20941640"," What do Bill Gross say about it?"
"20941800","20942020"," Everything."
"20942600","20943120"," Oh, okay. "
"20943420","20943620"," Yeah."
"20943820","20944820"," No, you'll have to go back."
"20945580","20948180"," I listened to a little bit, but I was busy working on my broadcast. "
"20948540","20948980"," I got it."
"20949060","20951900"," I got it."
"20953900","20954580"," I love Halloween. "
"20955140","20955320"," So fun."
"20955560","20956700"," So does Walt Disney World."
"20957020","20958560"," What else do you talk about in mid-August?"
"20958820","20964820"," There is a fantastic story in the Wall Street Journal saying that Walt Disney World is rolling out"
"20964820","20967300"," jack-o-lanterns on Main Street, USA. "
"20967740","20971540"," There's a fantastic quote in the story that August is the new September."
"20972000","20973680"," That is from an associate professor at Fr."
"20973800","20974500"," Mill State College. "
"20974820","20975340"," And get this."
"20975540","20976460"," I have a size and scope."
"20976460","20978060"," I have a size and scope. "
"20978440","20983800"," All six dates in August for Mickey's not so scary Halloween party have sold out already."
"20984480","20984920"," Okay."
"20985080","20986480"," So first of all, August is the new September. "
"20986820","20986960"," Yes."
"20986960","20987920"," But Halloween is in October."
"20988580","20990480"," So I'm still confused by this. "
"20990800","20995720"," So am I supposed to, is this like a read on like how trouble the Disney parts are that they"
"20995720","20997040"," got to like do Halloween early?"
"20997260","20997900"," When's Christmas coming?"
"20998080","20998940"," Is that going to be like what?"
"20999200","21000000"," September 2nd?"
"21000300","21000840"," Yeah, exactly."
"21001320","21001380"," Exactly."
"21001800","21005780"," Right after they get through basically on November 1st or maybe I will say the Halloween is"
"21005780","21006780"," actually my favorite holiday. "
"21006940","21007840"," I'm going to dress up."
"21008040","21009100"," Are you going to be Ken this year?"
"21009320","21010040"," Because Barbie costumes."
"21010040","21012080"," There's going to be so many Barbie costumes. "
"21012240","21012800"," I was thinking about that."
"21012900","21015000"," I was like, everybody's going to be on Barbie something this year."
"21015120","21015740"," You could be Alan. "
"21016440","21017160"," That's no."
"21018240","21019520"," Nobody wants to be Alan."
"21020120","21022800"," You know what's interesting?"
"21023340","21025520"," Michael's launched in July, July 21st. "
"21025660","21030080"," I think it was started like the 100 days to Halloween and they started putting Halloween stuff out"
"21030080","21030300"," there."
"21030340","21030960"," But that makes sense."
"21030980","21031460"," It's got me in hell. "
"21031600","21032420"," So they make money, right?"
"21032600","21035700"," It's like, you know, Halloween and a couple other and then, you know, those five people who are"
"21035700","21036100"," still crafting."
"21036400","21036780"," Eddie Munson."
"21037120","21038040"," Eddie Munson perhaps. "
"21038040","21038440"," Yeah, that's for me."
"21039600","21039960"," Maverick."
"21040100","21041120"," Maverick from the Maverick. "
"21041180","21041820"," I need something cool."
"21041980","21042400"," Well, Maverick."
"21042900","21043260"," Ariel. "
"21043520","21044120"," Ariel costume."
"21044620","21045400"," Disney connection there."
"21046180","21046540"," Maybe. "
"21047340","21048880"," I'm going to be Carol Masters for Halloween."
"21048920","21049540"," Are you thinking serious?"
"21050440","21051160"," What's happening?"
"21051440","21051560"," Ariel."
"21052280","21052600"," We are. "
"21053020","21053660"," Is that like a mermaid?"
"21053760","21053840"," Yeah."
"21054140","21056120"," We are living in Katie's world."
"21056440","21056980"," Love it. "
"21057220","21057400"," Love it."
"21057580","21058180"," Let's end it there."
"21059700","21061260"," Just as just have anything to say?"
"21061560","21062260"," Does she let you talk?"
"21062480","21063840"," I feel like we all should. "
"21064120","21066120"," Carol Masters would be the best Halloween costume Katie."
"21066120","21066560"," I agree."
"21066900","21068600"," What is Carol Masters costume?"
"21068920","21069700"," I've got to get some highlights. "
"21070260","21070640"," Oh, I'm sure."
"21071080","21072040"," I'll just go on that note."
"21072300","21072520"," Yeah. "
"21072700","21075220"," We'll be back in about 15 minutes until the answer's that question."
"21075720","21076100"," All right, guys."
"21076300","21076920"," Join us at 4pm. "
"21077060","21080780"," We're going to wrap up the trading day and the trading week, our cross-platform radio, TV, YouTube,"
"21080880","21082400"," and of course, Bloomberg Originals."
"21082400","21083260"," We call it P on the bell."
"21083260","21084060"," We'll see you at 4pm. "
"21084380","21084820"," Wall street time."
"21085520","21085880"," Wishing."
"21086640","21086980"," And hoping. "
"21087560","21088180"," And thinking."
"21088720","21089260"," And praying."
"21090060","21090420"," Planet. "
"21091140","21091500"," And dreaming."
"21092060","21093860"," Each night of his charm."
"21098540","21099420"," All right, everybody. "
"21099740","21102480"," We do want to talk a bit more about the inflation picture."
"21102980","21104640"," Whether or not you bought your Halloween costume."
"21105360","21108020"," That will provide some economic momentum, no doubt about it. "
"21108180","21109900"," But another day, another inflation print."
"21110080","21111020"," We just talked about it."
"21111180","21111760"," Jess and I did. "
"21112000","21116980"," US producer prices picking up in July, primarily due to increases in certain service categories,"
"21117400","21119600"," highlighting the choppy nature of getting inflation back down to target."
"21119800","21125640"," But you heard Romaine say, you know, we were called all kind of happy or felt encouraged by the CPI"
"21125640","21126640"," print yesterday."
"21127260","21128820"," PPI felt a little bit different today, Jess. "
"21129160","21132920"," And especially because I know Anna Wong will get into this, but she was thinking the month over"
"21132920","21136400"," month number was going to be actually a tick higher than it actually didn't."
"21136540","21139480"," And we're not seeing necessarily the energy numbers flow fluid just yet."
"21139760","21139920"," All right. "
"21139920","21144300"," So let's get into it and see what our Bloomberg News senior editor, Chris Ansey has to say."
"21144400","21148880"," He's on Zoom in Boston and Bloomberg economics chief, US economist, as Jess mentioned, Anna Wong."
"21149020","21149960"," She's on the phone in DC. "
"21150900","21152320"," Anna, let me kick it off with you."
"21152320","21154960"," You're taking your analysis following that release."
"21155780","21156440"," Yeah. "
"21156560","21162580"," I think overall it's still consistent with our view that the near-term inflationary impulse is that"
"21162580","21163480"," of going down."
"21164060","21170720"," So the PPI is important because parts of it fit into the inflation metric that the Fed cares about,"
"21170880","21171980"," which is core PCE."
"21172580","21180720"," And what's driving the uptick today was actually financial portfolio management, which is a very"
"21180720","21182880"," jumpy and volatile category. "
"21182880","21184320"," What is that category?"
"21184900","21186200"," It sounds so wonky."
"21186860","21187220"," Right."
"21187840","21193420"," It's reflective of what's going on in the bond market and stocks market. "
"21194040","21200880"," And for example, if there's a stock rally, it could drive up that number."
"21201200","21208100"," So I think that actually is not even though that counts into the super core measure that Powell"
"21208100","21208640"," cares about."
"21208980","21211080"," They know that this is a volatile category. "
"21211540","21215180"," So if we focus on the sticky part, actually, they're all going down."
"21215480","21222460"," And particularly today's University of Michigan short-term and long-term inflation expectations are"
"21222460","21224200"," numbers are what the Fed cares about."
"21224200","21225560"," They are also going down. "
"21226240","21232940"," And so I think the the signals that the Fed cares about are basically unambiguously pointing that"
"21232940","21234300"," inflation is going down."
"21234300","21236220"," I want to bring Chris into this conversation."
"21236660","21238580"," Some other data that we did get this morning. "
"21238780","21242980"," If you're looking at the University of Michigan, those inflation expectations also unexpectedly"
"21242980","21243540"," falling."
"21243940","21245480"," So what's the worry here?"
"21245540","21246040"," Do you think, Chris?"
"21247380","21257200"," Well, I think, you know, you can see the worry, especially in the market reaction yesterday to"
"21257200","21262880"," CPI compared with the market reaction to the previous month CPI."
"21263520","21272200"," So as we have flagged, you know, the 0.2% increase month on month for July was the same"
"21272200","21272800"," as June. "
"21273400","21278040"," Back in June when we got that figure, investors were cheering, right?"
"21278340","21279680"," Stocks rallied on the day."
"21279960","21281640"," Treasuries rallied on the day."
"21281920","21288300"," Yesterday, we got a little bit of a rally in stocks, but then we closed, you know, pretty much flat"
"21288300","21288980"," today. "
"21288980","21290880"," The market is not really doing much."
"21291340","21292720"," Treasure yields are higher."
"21293360","21302260"," So I think actually the idea that inflation is going to stick around at an uncomfortably high level"
"21302260","21304340"," is starting to percolate. "
"21304920","21313080"," And in fact, I think Anna is among those who has been saying that all is not necessarily rosy"
"21313080","21319660"," looking ahead into the fall and that there are a number of inflation dynamics that continue to be a"
"21319660","21320080"," concern."
"21320960","21324360"," I think that investors are coming to grips with this."
"21324940","21332080"," And so, you know, you look at a number like Yumish inflation expectations and folks are saying,"
"21332080","21337740"," well, that's nice, but I think they're looking to, and I'm sure Anna can talk in more detail about"
"21337740","21343420"," this at some of the, you know, unpleasant dynamics that are still in train. "
"21343420","21348480"," Well, then Anna, come on in, come back in on this because I am thinking about to what Neil Dutta"
"21348480","21353720"," put out and shared with us all this morning right after the PPI print and said, you know, well,"
"21354080","21356960"," freight rates are bottoming, oil prices are climbing."
"21357900","21364720"," If you look at companies paying up big for workers in some cyclical industries, UPS, GM Ford, in an"
"21364720","21369180"," above trend economy in tight labor markets, he writes, and I'm reading from this note, risks"
"21369180","21371060"," building that the Fed has more work to do."
"21371060","21372240"," So that higher for longer. "
"21373220","21374120"," You agree?"
"21374360","21374720"," Disagree?"
"21376080","21376280"," Anna?"
"21376560","21377700"," I disagree."
"21378180","21384580"," Well, so I think the inflation picture is complicated, and that Chris is right that there's some"
"21384580","21390820"," worry, some dynamics in the fall, and wishes that oil prices rising, and we have extreme weather"
"21390820","21396880"," patterns, which could introduce new adverse supply risk, which could reverse the progress on some"
"21396880","21397860"," of the supply chain bottoming."
"21397860","21403540"," But at the same time, I think where we differ from Neil, Dutta, and many other people in Wall"
"21403540","21409200"," Street is that we do think that the U.S. economy actually is not re-accelerating. "
"21409560","21411920"," In fact, a lot of cracks are showing."
"21412300","21419440"," Some recessionary dynamics are showing its ugly head, which is number one, rising surging, actually"
"21419440","21427700"," surging bankruptcies among small firms, and rising credit delinquencies, even before student loan"
"21427700","21428940"," payments are resuming."
"21429200","21430780"," So it comes September. "
"21431360","21437760"," After September, we're going to see, we expect to see a surge in delinquencies, and then lenders"
"21437760","21441020"," will further tighten their lending standards."
"21441740","21445360"," And that's how you get that recessionary downward spiral."
"21446020","21450760"," And so we also think that the labor market is overstating the strength, a lot of the non-farm"
"21450760","21454700"," strength payroll strength that we have seen are going to be revised down. "
"21455220","21461860"," In fact, it's even possible that two years from now we see that monthly non-farm payroll was"
"21461860","21463420"," actually negative last month."
"21464060","21465260"," So that's where we are."
"21465460","21470400"," We think core inflation, there's a very strong disinflationary in-pounds in the rest of the year. "
"21470540","21476060"," But the risk is that headline inflation will be going up, but because inflation expectations are"
"21476060","21480240"," going down, the Fed will look through these adverse oil shocks."
"21480240","21485140"," And Chris, I have to get your thoughts because JP Morgan and Bank of America have both dropped"
"21485140","21489620"," their recession calls for this year, but you still have Wells Fargo that's hesitant to do so."
"21489880","21494980"," What is giving some of these Wall Street firms pause still to keep those recession calls at this"
"21494980","21495360"," point?"
"21496220","21500780"," Well, I think Anna was just pointing to some of the dynamics. "
"21501520","21509760"," You know, one thing that is kind of hard to gauge, and the bankruptcy numbers that Anna points to"
"21509760","21519040"," our symptom of it, but is the magnitude of pain from the resetting of borrowing costs higher."
"21519700","21525520"," So, you know, any company that took out a loan a few years ago sold a bond a few years"
"21525520","21533600"," ago that needs to refinance that when it comes to, you know, today, later today, next week, in"
"21533600","21538140"," coming months, next year, that's going to be at a much higher cost."
"21539120","21546480"," You know, one other symptom that we see of this dynamic is the rapidly surging debt interest"
"21546480","21548980"," payments that the U.S. Treasury is paying. "
"21549740","21557540"," And we get nice, you know, figures on that on a monthly basis, even on a daily basis."
"21557540","21565440"," And we're seeing that that cost is soaring by hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars for the"
"21565440","21566040"," U.S. government."
"21566460","21568700"," Well, this is also happening at the corporate level. "
"21569280","21571840"," We don't have such great data on that."
"21572060","21575320"," But we know the dynamic is going to impart a lot of pain."
"21575900","21581920"," And the higher that, you know, that interest rates go, the longer that they stay at these elevated"
"21581920","21585570"," levels, we're going to see an increasing economic impact. "
"21586070","21591830"," And I think that's a dynamic that leaves many on Wall Street, including the ones you mentioned,"
"21592250","21593490"," still seeing a recession."
"21593770","21594350"," You know, it's interesting."
"21595010","21599310"," As everybody's backed off the recession call and as more strategists are upping their targets, I do"
"21599310","21602990"," feel like our guests who come on and talk about the market all want to kind of take some money"
"21602990","21605030"," off the table and want to be a little bit more cautious. "
"21605630","21607450"," Chris, this question, I want to pose it to both of you."
"21607710","21612390"," You first, I mean, when it comes to as an editor, the things that you really and you and your"
"21612390","21618550"," team are watching very closely in terms of an indicator of the U.S. economy or maybe even the"
"21618550","21622010"," global economy, because everything we know, despite the pushback and globalization, we're all"
"21622010","21622210"," connected."
"21623650","21627130"," At the end of the day, you know, I just have to keep going back to jobs. "
"21628250","21633810"," And, you know, Anna says that they're going to turn at some point."
"21634630","21641010"," At the end of the day, you know, one of the key ingredients, right, National Bureau of Economic"
"21641010","21648230"," Research Business Cycle Dating Committee, you know, determination for heading into a recession is"
"21648230","21648790"," payrolls."
"21648970","21650050"," They have to come down. "
"21650670","21655930"," And so if we don't get negative numbers, and if we don't see a softening in the job market, I"
"21655930","21657270"," don't know how to get a recession."
"21657710","21659710"," Hey, Anna, save 30 seconds for you."
"21659870","21662550"," Your number one thing, top of mind that you keep an eye on just quickly. "
"21662550","21668090"," It would be senior loan officer reporting of whether they're tightening credit conditions."
"21668830","21674890"," Non-farm payrolls could be negative right now, because actually those things are measured very"
"21675370","21677010"," inaccurately in the eve of the recession."
"21677390","21680410"," So I don't think I'm not putting too much weight on that right now. "
"21680590","21680770"," All right."
"21680910","21682510"," Well, great discussion as we head into the weekend."
"21682750","21683690"," Guys, thank you so much. "
"21684170","21688590"," Chris Anstihi is, of course, Bloomberg new senior editor on Zoom and Boston and Bloomberg economics"
"21688590","21690190"," chief U.S. economist Anna Wong."
"21690190","21692990"," She is always a must-read by everyone here at Bloomberg."
"21693310","21694450"," We really appreciate both of them. "
"21694850","21698490"," She's joining us on the phone in D.C. Carol Messer, along with Jess Matton."
"21698610","21700290"," She's in for Tim Stenoveck on this Friday."
"21700970","21704950"," More to come right here on Bloomberg Business Week on radio on YouTube and, of course, Bloomberg"
"21704950","21705430"," Originals. "
"21705750","21706970"," This is Bloomberg Radio."
"21712990","21716190"," Bloomberg Radio on demand and in your podcast feed."
"21716190","21721730"," On the latest edition of the tape podcast, a conversation with Robert Teeter at Silvercrest Asset"
"21721730","21722150"," Management. "
"21722770","21726370"," Why are you optimistic that inflation will continue to decline?"
"21727010","21730410"," Well, I think one of the reasons is that we've seen most of the inflationary fuel dissipates."
"21731030","21734730"," So monetary growth has all but flatlined here."
"21735050","21739190"," You've seen all of the supply chain problems dissipate, the index that's widely maintained and"
"21739190","21741710"," followed there really only hit normal just a few months ago. "
"21742110","21745810"," You've seen a lot of the demand swings in the economy start to normalize."
"21745810","21750930"," We're still seeing some of that, but supply and demand are a bit more stable and allowing companies"
"21750930","21754030"," to really produce at a level that they need to to keep prices and check."
"21754250","21758810"," And so I'm relatively optimistic on the pace of inflation continuing to decline from an economic"
"21758810","21759470"," perspective. "
"21759790","21762970"," But I think from a market perspective, we've maybe gotten a little bit ahead of ourselves and"
"21762970","21763930"," there's a bit more work to do."
"21764130","21769870"," The CPI figures don't necessarily look ahead to things like rising oil prices."
"21770590","21774010"," When we think of the Fed, they're looking at this core number that strips out all this other stuff"
"21774010","21777230"," that is the stuff that consumers potentially feel most. "
"21777590","21779470"," Is this going to change the Fed's thinking?"
"21780070","21784090"," So the way that I look at that on a go forward basis of trying to estimate the pace of"
"21784090","21787710"," the decline in CPI and I think that's the real open question mark for markets here."
"21788130","21788770"," I think you're right."
"21788870","21792230"," There are a number of things that are likely to put some upward pressure on CPI and the energy"
"21792230","21793870"," complex certainly being one of those. "
"21794350","21796990"," The one that's the biggest one, of course, on the downside is housing."
"21797350","21801330"," And so when we look through some of those estimates of how much of the contribution from CPI from"
"21801330","21804830"," housing well over 2%, it looks like maybe middle of next year."
"21805110","21806290"," That starts to go flat. "
"21806850","21812550"," So if I add back in more energy inflation than we have currently and I take out the housing, I"
"21812550","21817090"," get to a point where I sort of estimate we hit that 2% Fed target sometime in the middle"
"21817090","21817710"," of next year."
