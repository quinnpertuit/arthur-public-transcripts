"9000","22970"," This one"
"22970","23470"," here."
"44960","51140"," It's the work by Nuest, Personalization. "
"55720","62000"," That one."
"69320","70680"," Sorry about that this morning, guys."
"71420","72700"," Let me just one quick second here. "
"73500","76340"," I've got a, I don't know if it's stream labs or internet related."
"76560","80960"," It's one of the other, but I rebooted the internet and stream labs, so this should be good to go."
"95200","95960"," Do it morning. "
"96160","96980"," How y'all do it out there."
"97580","98140"," Go Lions."
"100180","130480"," The NBC"
"130480","137180"," retail and focus as investors continue to watch for cracks and what has been a strong, surprisingly"
"137180","138440"," strong consumer. "
"138640","140780"," I sat down with Ralph Lauren CEO, Patrice Louvay."
"141120","145740"," Last week in Davos, we discussed his outlook for the company heading into 2024, the global market,"
"145740","148900"," and of course, the hottest topic this year, artificial intelligence."
"151040","153660"," We're cautiously optimistic as we get into 2024. "
"154320","157880"," I think one of the things that really gets characterized the work we've done with Ralph Lauren in"
"157880","163840"," particular is our ability of building resilience into our business model into our brand so that you"
"163840","167480"," can count on Ralph Lauren irrespective of what the environment will look"
"167480","178880"," like."
"178880","181880"," It really was a reckoning for retailers like yours and a test of leadership."
"182580","185500"," Yeah, I think there are a few areas that have evolved for us. "
"186020","188700"," First of all, if you look at the way consumers have been shopping, right?"
"188840","191920"," There's been a pretty significant pivot that we all have to make towards digital."
"192660","195780"," That's been a big new capability for us, and it stayed."
"196020","198020"," About a quarter of our business knowledge is digital. "
"198740","203180"," The second area is you look at how people dress and what's changed there, and you can hear a lot"
"203180","204600"," about quiet luxury."
"204860","210300"," I think in times of uncertainty, consumers are gravitating towards branding, no product they trust,"
"211160","215700"," and so we're seeing that clearly evolve as consumers move to more sophisticated casual dressing."
"215700","220820"," And then I think we've just learned to build a bigger agility muscle, right?"
"221180","226180"," And obviously we have supply chain challenges as we speak with what's happening in this way as"
"226180","226420"," canal. "
"226720","230400"," And I think one of the one of the new muscles that the company has developed is this ability to"
"230400","231560"," just be nimble and be agile."
"232020","237220"," Just a heads up here on a 30 minute basis spoos is looking for a role here, role to the"
"237220","237500"," downside."
"260980","262240"," We're driving that successfully. "
"263080","266300"," China, as you and I have talked in the past, is a major opportunity for us."
"266760","269360"," China today is about 67% of the company."
"270240","273620"," Pre-COVID, it was around 3%, so we made good progress. "
"273920","280420"," But when you compare the penetration of luxury companies, and China is more 20, 30, 40% of the"
"280420","282680"," business, so I think we have a lot of runway in China."
"283520","287140"," Southeast Asia in general is a significant white-faced opportunity for us."
"287820","289720"," And then we're starting to plant seeds in India. "
"290120","291960"," I know that's a topic this week, right?"
"293480","297440"," But would it really a lens to the next 10 years and the next 20 years to make sure we're"
"297440","303780"," building the right brand positioning, the right brand equity so that we can benefit from that in"
"303780","304740"," the many decades to come?"
"304740","310100"," China's been a really good story for you and a growth driver, as you mentioned, even amid questions"
"310100","316800"," last year and going into this year about the strength of their recovery, how much China is willing"
"316800","321740"," to add stimulus, to use retail sales and economic growth."
"322460","323480"," What are you seeing on that front?"
"323480","326500"," China has been consistently strong for us."
"326600","328420"," You saw that in our last quarter release. "
"329000","331680"," I think what the team is doing really well there is we're very focused."
"332000","336580"," We focus on top six cities, Taipei, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Shanghai, Beijing."
"337380","343620"," We are building consumer-centric ecosystems with a flagship store, a polo boutique, surround sound"
"343620","344960"," digital, quality wholesale. "
"345860","348920"," On the product front, this is where we sell our most elevated product, actually."
"349240","352960"," Our most expensive cashmere sweaters are actually loved by our Chinese consumers."
"354020","355380"," And so we're leaning into that. "
"355860","360100"," We've also seen really nice diversity in terms of the makeup of our customer base, to younger"
"360100","362400"," consumer, more diverse from a gender standpoint."
"362400","368020"," And I think the team is doing a great job bringing our purpose to life, which is global and"
"368020","371140"," universal, and weaving that into the Chinese culture."
"371540","373340"," You said the most high-end cashmere sweaters. "
"373620","373700"," Yes."
"373940","376280"," How much is the high-end cashmere sweaters?"
"376460","377360"," Oh, there's a broad range."
"377660","380800"," If you're ready for it, you could spend $1000"
"380800","390440"," or more on that. "
"390440","392940"," You're trying to play in that area and competing against."
"393680","395420"," Yeah, so we've made good progress on valuation."
"395760","397380"," Obviously, we want to continue to drive that. "
"397560","400780"," And our goal is to be associated with the key luxury players."
"402080","408280"," I think when you look at our business in Europe and Asia, clearly our positioning is there."
"408620","410820"," We have work to do in North America to elevate our positioning. "
"411120","415180"," I think as we continue to do that, I think the financial community will recognize that and we'll"
"415180","420360"," continue to see our valuation come closer to the historical luxury players."
"420440","427260"," Another top of the agenda issue here in Dallas is generative AI and its explosion onto the scene."
"427600","430820"," I know that you're thinking about it, experimenting with it. "
"431520","433700"," How do you think it's going to change the fashion business?"
"434800","436960"," So this business started with human creativity."
"437340","438400"," I don't think that goes away."
"438860","441520"," I reassure Ralph and I tell him. "
"441640","449600"," I'm going to show you guys up here really quick."
"449600","449860"," Be careful."
"450220","455600"," I'm going to go to the trigger screen here. "
"460860","464120"," Just on a 30-minute basis here on Spy."
"465840","470810"," I want to draw your attention just here."
"471110","475310"," See this maxed out hourly trend right here and half our trend. "
"475550","479690"," Whenever we hit stuff like this, we tend to roll to the downside over here."
"480390","481790"," Just be wary of it."
"482630","487090"," Whenever you see it stuff like this, you get that grind and then that roll coming down. "
"488130","490170"," Just on a one-minute basis here."
"490550","491710"," Doesn't mean we can't go up from here."
"491770","493990"," It does mean though that we are a little long in the tooth. "
"495370","500510"," We could possibly experience some kind of a roll coming up either today, tomorrow, something like"
"500510","502190"," that, at least on a 30-minute basis."
"534990","542310"," More, but this is where this is Lou Bay's mission is to bring Ralph Lauren as a competitor against"
"542310","543370"," the European luxury giants."
"543370","548430"," The reach month, the LVMH, the carings and to get a stock market valuation on par with that as"
"548430","548610"," well. "
"549410","551270"," You got to get margins on par with that too."
"552150","556290"," He's done some work on it, but yeah, there's clearly more to be done."
"556490","558090"," One of the richest men in the world, right?"
"558630","559990"," He's done that. "
"561070","563170"," I'm not sure the cost of manufacturing is that different?"
"564530","569110"," No, and I think he has to continue to elevate the brand in places like North America where outlets"
"569110","570910"," were a big part of the story for a while."
"571670","576310"," Before he came in, it did go very mass market into the wholesale division."
"576570","578830"," He's trying to work on that in an effort to boost margins. "
"580310","581530"," You are, it's called in retail."
"581910","586810"," It's the pure play luxury brands have that mode where they don't have to discount at all."
"587330","589550"," Still to come this morning, have we hit peak oil?"
"590030","594350"," We'll find out what the CEO of Aramco is saying about that and oil demand when we return from a"
"594350","594550"," break. "
"777720","778480"," I need insurance."
"782120","782840"," Welcome back."
"783020","785080"," I have the Stevens at your CNBC News Update. "
"785600","789700"," A judge postponed Donald Trump's defamation trial for at least one day."
"790300","795320"," The former president was expected to testify today in the case which will decide how much he will"
"795320","797740"," have to pay for defaming writer Eugene Carroll."
"797960","804460"," Both had already arrived at the courtroom when the judge put the trial on hold because a juror and"
"804460","806780"," two of Trump's lawyers weren't feeling well. "
"807300","813220"," Family members of hostages held by Hamas stormed an Israeli parliament session today after Prime"
"813220","819340"," Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told them there's no real proposal from Hamas for another hostage deal."
"820040","823960"," An estimated 130 hostages are still being held in Gaza."
"824740","830060"," And New Hampshire Democrats say voters in the state are receiving a robocall imitating President"
"830060","834220"," Biden's voice telling them not to vote in Tuesday's primary election. "
"834900","839800"," The president actually won't be on the ballot because the Democratic National Committee mandates"
"839800","845300"," that South Carolina's primary is the first sanctioned contest of the 2024 nominating race."
"845980","849780"," However, local supporters started a writing campaign for the president."
"849780","853280"," It's not yet clear how many people received the robocall. "
"853520","854360"," Sarah, back to you."
"854940","855620"," Peppa, thank you."
"856180","860660"," Energy, a big topic for business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year amid"
"860660","863260"," growing geopolitical tensions, conflicts abroad. "
"864000","867800"," While I was there, I had the chance to sit down with the CEO of Aramco, the world's biggest"
"867800","873920"," integrated oil and gas company, to discuss amid all of this push toward clean energy and renewables"
"873920","876700"," and EVs whether we've hit peak oil."
"877040","877160"," Listen."
"879780","882260"," Let's look at 2023 last year. "
"884220","886560"," We will talk about peak oil even before that."
"886740","889620"," But last year, we were 102.5 million power."
"891280","896140"," 2024, they're talking about another one million and a half, 110 folk. "
"896460","896960"," So not yet."
"897560","900300"," 2025, they're talking about another million power."
"900820","901740"," So there is growth. "
"902480","909780"," But you see, at the same time, you see, if you go back 40 and then I deal with the"
"909780","917380"," 80s when I joined, 80% of the energy used was from fossil fuel."
"920060","922440"," Today, it's 80%."
"922440","924200"," But the scale is high. "
"925520","930700"," When you go there on peak oil, I also asked Nasser about global oil demand right now."
"930840","931280"," Here's what he said."
"933260","936200"," If you look at the forecast, they're talking about 100 and 4."
"936920","942560"," This is in the middle of economic headwinds. "
"942680","948600"," Still, we are not over what the economic situation we are in."
"949320","950620"," But still, it's a healthy growth."
"950620","955740"," If you think about it, even last year, we have grown by about 2.6 million power. "
"956920","961440"," So if you talk about 24 or a growth of 1.5 million power, that is significant."
"962020","965740"," So there is a demand and there is a significant growth."
"966260","968640"," And that's what we are seeing from our customers. "
"969500","971780"," Healthy growth, significant demand."
"972280","977380"," For the full conversation, you can tune in tonight for a CNBC leaders special at 8 p.m. Eastern"
"977380","977700"," Time."
"978400","984080"," Because he's been at the helm here for several years, including taking this company through World's"
"984080","990220"," Biggest IPO, which happened regionally, as opposed to some of the expectations leading up, got them"
"990220","993180"," through the attacks by the Houthi rebels, the drone attacks. "
"993180","998260"," I mean, we went through leadership and because we had a long time to talk about it, we really got"
"998260","1004220"," to have a window into not only his leadership, but how unique of a company this is."
"1004460","1010840"," Remember, one that is what 98% owned by the Saudi government doesn't make the decisions on oil"
"1010840","1011580"," production, right?"
"1011800","1016760"," Because they're the OPEC producer, but has made a lot of other really important decisions leading"
"1016760","1021700"," and guiding this company, including toward this future where they are having to diversify into"
"1021700","1022900"," chemicals, for instance."
"1023180","1026599"," It's renewable energy and how he's thinking about doing that. "
"1027160","1029119"," I mean, there are enormous in chemicals as well."
"1029359","1029359"," Huge."
"1029640","1035300"," I think he's done $95 billion worth of deals to bring Aramco more into chemicals and refining. "
"1036579","1041079"," No, it's like sitting down even more so with Darren Woods or Mike Worth."
"1041300","1046079"," I mean, they're running an enormous company, one of the largest market caps in"
"1046079","1053160"," the world."
"1053160","1058280"," And they're very bullish on China and they've tightened the relationship there with China and with"
"1058280","1060040"," some of the Chinese oil companies as well. "
"1060240","1064400"," So we talked a lot about that, what he's seeing both economically and geopolitically."
"1065660","1067440"," All right, let's fight for everyone to watch."
"1067700","1068200"," Yeah, of course. "
"1068400","1068660"," What time?"
"1068920","1070720"," 8 p.m. Eastern tonight, CNBC."
"1071320","1073040"," All right, well, let's stick with energy here."
"1073320","1078740"," So, as you take a look, I was starting to join Sarah at 8 p.m. The top pick for"
"1078740","1084420"," many across Wall Street, that is overall energy stocks, despite what's been a kind of tough start"
"1084420","1084820"," to the year. "
"1084880","1087060"," Let's get over to Brian Sullivan and the CNBC team."
"1087060","1089560"," They've been collecting all the names to watch here."
"1089980","1092260"," And as you see, Brian joins us now with a bit of a breakdown. "
"1092600","1092900"," Good morning."
"1093240","1094880"," Hey, good morning, David and Sarah and everybody."
"1095080","1098260"," All right, well, we're going to start with energy, but then I've got a little surprise for you guys"
"1098260","1098800"," at the end. "
"1098920","1104020"," We're going to show you all the stocks in any sector that are on four or five top picks list"
"1104020","1106540"," of Wall Street firms for the year to give you a little investing edge."
"1106540","1111240"," Quick note is taking a lot of time, a big shout out to our colleague Mike Bloom for helping me"
"1111240","1114100"," sort through literally mountains of emails over the past month."
"1114480","1115740"," Could be a stock or two that we missed. "
"1115860","1118920"," This was a massive list, but we think this is a pretty good list."
"1119060","1122440"," All right, so now the names that are on Wall Street's top picks list."
"1122500","1126800"," And since I cover energy here at CNBC, let's start with that sector makes sense, right?"
"1126940","1130860"," And all the stocks appearing on at least one top pick list for the year. "
"1130860","1135040"," And it's fair to say, guys, that energy is not overall well loved."
"1135180","1140140"," There are only 23 different energy or energy related stocks across more than 35 firms that we track"
"1140140","1141500"," on any kind of top picks list."
"1141980","1146140"," All right, the first list is the more pure energy stocks, oil and gas companies. "
"1146340","1147820"," You got Exxon Chevron."
"1148020","1152380"," Okay, we know that you got Katera, the original fang Diamondback Civitas energy."

"1170940","1172900"," Some names like air products and Lind."
"1173260","1174780"," You say, well, why are those on energy?"
"1175100","1177060"," Because they're both hydrogen plays."
"1177060","1180220"," You got chemical companies, Huntsman and Methonex, Pentair. "
"1180560","1184070"," They help oil and gas firms push water through wells, darling, this biofuels."

"1193780","1197460"," is on at least one top pick list this year. "
"1197620","1203740"," So guys, there are the 23 energy or energy related names most loved by Wall Street this year."
"1203940","1206880"," But, you know, as I said, I'm not just tracking energy stocks."
"1206880","1208780"," In fact, there's a number of names. "
"1208960","1209740"," So here's what we did guys."
"1210040","1216020"," We went through Carl and we basically sorted all the stocks and we found out how many are on"
"1216020","1219260"," multiple top picks or best bet type lists."
"1219480","1225220"," Okay, for example, Exxon and Chevron, they're on three different firms lists, but there are stocks"
"1225220","1228820"," showing up on four, five or even more top picks list. "
"1228820","1230620"," We spend a lot of time breaking them out."

"1278540","1279700"," It goes from seven to eight."
"1279800","1280500"," So here's what I suggest. "
"1281240","1287500"," Watch last call from seven to eight and then roll right in to leaders with Alman Nasser."
"1287840","1288380"," How does that sound?"
"1288860","1289800"," I love that, Brian."
"1290060","1291320"," It sounds like a perfect evening. "
"1291760","1292240"," What could be better?"
"1293000","1293820"," Being at home."
"1294400","1295240"," Being at home."
"1295580","1297460"," Yeah, watching you. "
"1297860","1298740"," Brian, thank you."
"1298980","1299460"," And then me."
"1299800","1300300"," Brian Sullivan. "
"1301000","1305720"," For more on the energy picture and my conversation with the CEO of Aramco, be sure to tune in right"
"1305720","1308940"," after last call to CNBC leaders, 8 p.m. Eastern Time."
"1309160","1309620"," Don't go anywhere."
"1493300","1498080"," I've got a couple of movers for you this morning, including shares of Arthur Daniels, Mendelins,"
"1498200","1500100"," see them right there down over 13%. "
"1500100","1501700"," There were a number of downgrades."
"1502020","1507440"," The company did issue fourth quarter guidance that seemed to be below many analysts' prior"
"1507440","1513160"," expectations, but the key reason why the stock is down is that it is placed at CFO on leave."
"1513160","1519080"," This is amidst an investigation into accounting practices specific to its nutrition reporting"
"1519080","1523260"," segment, including as related to certain intersegment transactions. "
"1523420","1529720"," Apparently, this was initiated after the SEC asked for a voluntary document request."
"1530540","1531260"," They gave them the documents."
"1531480","1537220"," They're cooperating and whatever they saw, at least warranted suspending their CFO. "
"1537500","1539200"," They have an interim CFO who stepped in."
"1539200","1543000"," On the flip side of that, take a look at shares of a firm company."
"1543200","1547860"," We follow up over 9%, maybe just on rates, getting a little bit better this morning. "
"1548020","1550740"," Sarah, hard to know specifically what's behind that."
"1550820","1554480"," But there've been a number of whether it's a firm, upstart, palantier, just in general, sort of"
"1554480","1555840"," some significant moves this morning."
"1556440","1558160"," Among certain technology related. "
"1558360","1560320"," Yeah, the arch innovation fund is up 4%."
"1560320","1564980"," So that's always a good benchmark of some of those less profitable or unprofitable tech names,"
"1564980","1566040"," which are rallying today."
"1566040","1570300"," Let's talk housing, new home sales and pending home sales data out later this week. "
"1570300","1574600"," And with average mortgage rates now below 7%, buyer demand is coming back."
"1574820","1580040"," However, our next guest warns of challenges ahead, such as quote, the lock in effect of current"
"1580040","1580480"," homeowners."
"1581220","1582200"," Robert Refkin joins us. "
"1582260","1583520"," Compass co-founder and CEO."
"1584360","1585060"," It's good to see you."
"1585580","1585820"," Welcome. "
"1586300","1587120"," Thank you for having us."
"1587380","1591640"," You were saying that things look are looking a little bit different here as we go into 2024."
"1591760","1592200"," How?"
"1592200","1594160"," Yeah, well, it's official as of Friday. "
"1594700","1601780"," The number of homes that sold last year was 4.1 million of the lowest level since 1995, and the"
"1601780","1604400"," population today is 27% bigger than 1995."
"1605500","1610440"," However, this year, all the key signs are pointing the right direction, specifically inventory,"
"1611320","1616940"," because more inventory equals more sales and you have 7% more inventory today than this time of"
"1616940","1617340"," year ago."
"1617340","1621880"," And you can see as well, 5% more homes under contract today than a year ago. "
"1622180","1624440"," So is it that mortgage rates?"
"1624580","1625140"," Is it the relief?"
"1625360","1626240"," Is that what's changing things?"
"1626460","1631560"," 8.1% mortgage rates last fall was very difficult, but now it's basically free marketing to the"
"1631560","1634080"," entire real estate market saying that 6.8 is a good deal."
"1634520","1635040"," And so you have more?"
"1635180","1635660"," Is that working?"
"1635960","1636700"," It is working."
"1636880","1637360"," You have more buyers"
"1637360","1647320"," than sellers. "
"1647320","1651560"," You have all homes in the fall, having a price drop, and so prices are better now than they were."
"1652180","1656520"," The Redfin data on listings, new homeless things, is up to 7 year on year."
"1656800","1657380"," You think that's low?"
"1657940","1663680"," Yeah, I think that we're going to continue to see more demand for new homes than existing, because"
"1663680","1669360"," people today want things that are new, and there's just not enough homes available for sale in the"
"1669360","1673080"," existing home market because of the rate of the rate lock in effect. "
"1673080","1679380"," This time last year, 72% of homeowners were locked in at 4% or below."
"1679800","1681540"," Now it's actually 59%."
"1681540","1685020"," And so although it's still high, it's much better than it was a year ago. "
"1685080","1689680"," Do people try to beat each other to the punch before spring comes, or do we have to wait for"
"1689680","1690900"," spring out in classic fashion?"
"1690900","1696200"," In the last month, I've spoken to over 1,000 of our agents and just asked them how's the market"
"1696200","1696500"," going."
"1697260","1703960"," The most common quote I've heard is this is the busiest of January I've had on record, and more"
"1703960","1708700"," buyers are calling me over the holiday season than ever before."
"1708980","1713840"," They were working over Christmas, they were going to New Year's Day, New Year's Eve, and so I think"
"1713840","1718360"," buyers are trying to beat people to the punch before the spring market really gets. "
"1719060","1723800"," Regionally, you always give us a breakdown as it continues to be in some of these warmer places or"
"1723800","1725080"," low tax states that benefit."
"1725080","1728780"," And what about the pandemic darlings that they come back down to earth?"
"1729040","1736500"," The low tax, warm weather states are still very attractive."
"1737040","1740360"," I think Florida has more steam power than some of those other markets. "
"1740360","1746320"," Texas, Carolina is still strong, but Florida is just benefited longer than the others."
"1746760","1754760"," It is a vacation community that the entire country can go to, so it is a retirement community."
"1755460","1759780"," So if you're playing retirement fives now, you can just accelerate it earlier, and there's still"
"1759780","1765380"," enough of the country that's working from home where it does make it more viable. "
"1765380","1771980"," I would also say this bill over migration markets, and so markets, people move to when they're"
"1771980","1773280"," getting priced out of their core market."
"1773480","1781040"," So let's say San Francisco moving to Las Vegas or Sacramento, you have DC moving to Charlotte or"
"1781040","1786140"," Raleigh or Austin moving to San Antonio."
"1787640","1791240"," 6.8% is still a lot higher than where are you?"
"1791920","1794160"," I mean, most Americans have under 4% rates, right?"
"1794160","1801200"," Yes, 6.8% is still high, but that's encouraging for me to see the market be this strong with"
"1801200","1808400"," 6.8. Last year, it wasn't as strong as 6.8, so it shows that demand has been building over"
"1808400","1811540"," the course of last year, and you can only hold back the market for so long. "
"1812080","1813280"," Robert, thank you for the update."
"1813620","1814680"," It's always good to get color from you."
"1815040","1816280"," Robert Raffen from Compass. "
"1817000","1820740"," Still ahead this morning, I look at the stock route that's been hitting Chinese equities and"
"1820740","1827080"," erasing millions, much more than that in market cap, led live to Beijing for the latest after the"
"1827080","1827220"," break."
"1827780","1831640"," And an interview you don't want to miss next hour, the CEO of Marriott's with us will get a read"
"1831640","1833720"," on the consumer when we continue."
"2003010","2011790"," Asset.com China is keeping its low prime rates unchanged as stocks continue to sell off. "
"2011910","2015450"," The Hanksang approaching what is its lowest levels since 2009."
"2016350","2021050"," The CSI 300, that's an index of mainland Chinese shares that's also hitting multi-year lows."
"2021870","2022650"," Unisune joins us. "
"2022790","2024030"," She has the latest from Beijing."
"2024710","2029590"," Overall sort of, you know, the sentiment has got to not be particularly positive right now, Unis."
"2031250","2032810"," Absolutely not, David. "
"2033050","2034650"," It is very pessimistic over here."
"2034950","2036710"," Shanghai has hit a five-year low."
"2037070","2041270"," Investors are bailing out of Hong Kong as well, especially Chinese property plays. "
"2041830","2047750"," The central bank's decision was expected, but it's just feeding into the growing belief here that"
"2047750","2054290"," the government is not willing to make any meaningful stimulus or take any big action to try to"
"2054290","2055050"," shore up the economy."
"2055050","2060929"," In fact, most of the speculation around the non-action by the central bank was that the authorities"
"2060929","2066310"," are much more concerned about the potential downward pressure that they could put on the renminbi."
"2066909","2072989"," The authorities here are very sensitive about the possibility of the renminbi moving quickly,"
"2073230","2077909"," especially when it declines because they're worried about the potential for capital flight. "
"2077909","2084909"," The traders have been talking today about how state banks appear to have been making moves to try"
"2084909","2089050"," to stabilize the yuan, in fact, shore it up by selling dollars."
"2089429","2094330"," And there are also some reports in the market today that the regulator has been making unofficial"
"2094330","2101390"," guidance to some of the local funds to come up with new equity products in order to stabilize the"
"2101390","2101830"," market."
"2101830","2109270"," The state media has also been weighing in with the Xinhua, which is the state news agency, has been"
"2109270","2116370"," saying that really trying to debunk a narrative that we've been hearing, at least outside of China,"
"2116870","2122110"," that China, with all of its economic woes and its problems with its demographics, has hit peak"
"2122110","2122650"," China. "
"2122650","2130830"," And so Xinhua ran a piece today that said that it's an opportune time to pick China and not worry"
"2130830","2132730"," about peak China, guys."
"2133670","2135690"," You know, I'm curious on the domestic front."
"2135870","2140090"," I mean, you know, it's been many years since I was there, but there was a great deal of interest"
"2140090","2141750"," amongst Chinese in investing. "
"2142110","2147550"," I remember this is years ago, they go into sort of almost parlors and buy stock and sell stock like"
"2147550","2148310"," it was horse racing."
"2148310","2152650"," I don't know to what extent there is that kind of interest or enthusiasm."
"2152930","2157090"," But what is sort of the, you know, the mood and or the action on the ground amongst the domestic"
"2157090","2157630"," investors?"
"2159290","2161230"," Well, the mood is not very optimistic. "
"2161530","2165870"," In fact, I was talking to someone just yesterday about this, about where do you invest?"
"2166410","2171430"," And a lot of people here are really wondering where they can find any type of"
"2171430","2178290"," yield."
"2178290","2183670"," And I'm not saying that, you know, I've lost so much money and that's the sentiment that I've been"
"2183670","2185050"," hearing just in conversations."
"2185450","2188730"," Also, the property sector hasn't been doing well. "
"2188990","2190470"," So it's like home values going down."
"2190770","2191630"," Where do you put your money?"
"2192090","2195730"," People have been talking about, you know, where can they find investments overseas?"
"2196150","2200910"," But it's just gotten much more strict and you could potentially be flagged if you take money out of"
"2200910","2201310"," the country."
"2201430","2206010"," So it's a really, really difficult environment right now for average investors. "
"2206010","2210550"," And I think, I feel like we should separate both the near term issues, you know, which you describe"
"2210550","2214850"," on the economy, the cyclical issues and some longer term structural issues."
"2215270","2218790"," You know, the number that stood out to me was that foreign direct investment actually went down"
"2218790","2221110"," last year for the first time in years."
"2221410","2223490"," So it's not just investors that are worried about the economy. "
"2223730","2228650"," It's businesses worried about, I mean, big things like de-risking and geopolitical support."
"2228750","2231110"," And I wonder how much of a long term challenge that's going to be for China."
"2231110","2236310"," I think it's going to be a really big long term problem. "
"2236710","2242130"," People have been discussing how they feel that the outlook for China just isn't very good."
"2242230","2246830"," When you look at all of those things, deflation, de-risking, demographics, debt, everything."
"2247770","2251670"," So the outlook has been something that people are talking about and one of the reasons why we're"
"2251670","2254170"," seeing all this money outflow from the Chinese markets. "
"2255110","2258810"," Eunice, as always, appreciate your time and insights from Beijing."
"2259190","2259470"," Thank you."
"2261310","2263490"," Well, don't miss on the other side of this break. "
"2263630","2269310"," We're going to have Marriott's CEO and, of course, our live market coverage back continues at all"
"2269310","2271090"," times back in this."
"2442160","2449900"," Remember, good Monday morning."
"2450100","2450680"," Welcome to Money Movers. "
"2450840","2451380"," I'm Carl Keaton."
"2451480","2454320"," Sarah Eisenhower is in his back on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange."
"2454840","2459660"," Today, the street debates the next move for stocks with the S&P Dow and Nasdaq 100, all hitting"
"2459660","2460800"," some fresh all-time highs. "
"2461360","2465380"," We'll talk with HSBC's chief strategist on why he's putting risk exposure."
"2465860","2470980"," Then more from our conversation with the CEO of Ralph Lauren, advantages and risks he's seeing from"
"2470980","2471200"," AI."
"2471800","2475960"," Marriott unveiling some new growth numbers, which shares up 40% in the past year. "
"2476580","2478280"," Tony Capilano is with us live this hour."
"2478700","2481500"," Right now in the markets, as Carl said, new highs."
"2481800","2485220"," We continue the strength building on last week's more than 1% rally in the S&P. "
"2485360","2486220"," It was fueled by Big Tech."
"2486540","2488040"," Big Tech is leading again today."
"2488200","2492200"," Although there are some bright sectors like real estate on top of the market right now. "
"2492360","2493100"," Energy's lagging."
"2493460","2494420"," Nasdaq's up 2-10."
"2494580","2498200"," So is the S&P Dow also up a healthy 4-10 of 1%. "
"2498200","2503000"," Yields are backing off, so that's adding to some of the gains today, especially perhaps in some of"
"2503000","2507480"," the more speculative names, the unprofitable tech stocks that we're seeing big rallies in today,"
"2507720","2509480"," like in a firm or a palantier."
"2509760","2513000"," Topping the tape for us this morning is those new highs in stocks."
"2513320","2517500"," S&P Dow, Nasdaq 100, all setting new records at the open. "
"2518180","2520900"," But how will a ramp in corporate earnings impact the rally?"
"2521320","2527020"," Bank of America points out that fewer companies are beating versus history and beats, not"
"2527020","2530660"," necessarily rewarded by investors, while misses certainly get punished."
"2531220","2535920"," Let's bring in CNBC senior markets commentator Mike Santoli on the brink of a whole lot of"
"2535920","2536080"," earnings."
"2536440","2537220"," Yes, for sure. "
"2537340","2538200"," And that's a familiar pattern."
"2538400","2542660"," You can actually go back three months and say that was exactly how the third quarter earning season"
"2542660","2543000"," started."
"2543560","2548680"," Really kind of harsh responses, low beat rate, at least in the initial phases. "
"2548680","2553740"," And then it was a tale of two earning seasons, because you always get this sort of reducing of"
"2553740","2556020"," expectations people get used to the negative reactions."
"2556680","2559200"," And October 27th was the low in the market."
"2559460","2562380"," It was basically when all the big tech stocks culminated their reports. "
"2562680","2563840"," Those few days."
"2564220","2566980"," I don't think that's necessarily what we're looking at right here, because the field position of"
"2566980","2567880"," the market is very different."
"2568060","2569640"," We were in a deep correction back then. "
"2569940","2575680"," And so now it's much more about, can we get some confidence that 2024 full-year estimates are not"
"2575680","2576300"," pie in the sky?"
"2576300","2581280"," Well, the other point the B of A makes for that guidance ratio is that January guidance tends not"
"2581280","2584920"," to be great anyway, because there's no reason to promise the world so early in the year."
"2585240","2585920"," No doubt about it."
"2586100","2591600"," And really the way the market has treated the fundamentals recently, it's much more about, look,"
"2591760","2595120"," we're trading it 19, 20 times earnings at the headline index level. "
"2595360","2600820"," It's clearly because you expect a handful of secular trends to keep working and that we've seen the"
"2600820","2605160"," inflection point in earnings and they're going to be moving in a positive direction, not just for a"
"2605160","2605660"," couple of quarters."
"2605660","2607560"," But it's multiple years."
"2607660","2611360"," It sounds ridiculous in January to say we've got to have a couple of years of earnings growth. "
"2611860","2613740"," And at least that's what the market's looking ahead to."
"2614040","2616020"," But I think that's where we are at the moment."
"2616840","2619440"," Soft landing I think has been mostly embraced. "
"2619580","2624960"," You were talking earlier about how better economic numbers have not been toxic to at least the S&P"
"2624960","2628840"," 500, even though we're pushing out the potential for a first rate cut."
"2629600","2629820"," We'll see."
"2629960","2631540"," It's a bit of a delicate balance at this point. "
"2631540","2635920"," It's not clear to me that we've got the full reset below the surface that we were kind of"
"2635920","2636160"," expecting."
"2636200","2641500"," I was traveling last week and came back and went to the charts and saw the melt up in stocks,"
"2641640","2646420"," but it was surprising somewhat that it came with a big, I would say a jump in inflation"
"2646420","2646820"," expectations."
"2647360","2651840"," You saw that in the tips, the tenure tips market in the fact that yields were a little bit elevated"
"2651840","2654140"," and rate cut expectations paired back. "
"2654140","2654980"," Yeah, exactly."
"2655460","2661780"," Well, I'm not surprised that necessarily higher stock prices coinciding with, oh, maybe we have to"
"2661780","2663280"," wait for a first rate cut."
"2663720","2666360"," Also, market yields are still in the manageable range. "
"2666800","2671660"," It seems like it was really just profit taking in treasuries, and we're still below 4-1."
"2671800","2674980"," And so it's not necessarily forcing the issue as much as you might think."
"2675460","2676420"," Michael, talking a little bit. "
"2676540","2678480"," There's a lot to work with today, Mike Santoli."
"2679000","2683860"," Sticking with the markets with the first Fed meeting of 24 said, for next week, our next guest says"
"2683860","2688940"," Wall Street is pricing in too much easing for the year ahead, predicting three cuts beginning in"
"2688940","2692080"," June and keeping a pretty broad scope when it comes to finding value."
"2692080","2696040"," Joining us today, HSBC chief multi-acid strategist Max Kettner is back. "
"2696220","2697000"," Max, great to have you back."
"2698160","2698580"," Hello."
"2698800","2699060"," Thanks for"
"2699060","2712280"," having"
"2712280","2712280"," me. "
"2714700","2723080"," Yeah, I guess over the next couple of months, there's quite a few things that can go wrong in the"
"2723080","2727860"," sense that not that we're suddenly going to see a recession or really the data already rolling"
"2727860","2728260"," over."
"2728460","2731320"," I do think the danger is actually the exact opposite."
"2731860","2736700"," What we have seen over the last two, three months, of course, is a record easing of financial"
"2736700","2737440"," conditions. "
"2737440","2743180"," We're probably talking about private household wealth in the US that has risen by around 13"
"2743180","2748740"," trillion US dollars in 2023 on the back of that higher US equity market."
"2749060","2751960"," So there's a lot of power for the US consumer to spend."
"2751960","2754480"," There's been a lot of easing of financial conditions. "
"2754520","2760760"," But the other thing that hasn't changed is that in Q1 and Q2, actually near term growth"
"2760760","2764900"," expectations for both of those quarters are still very, very low from consensus."
"2764900","2771040"," So that centers on for a continued really low bar to be in terms of activities and phrases."
"2771500","2776260"," And I think the danger is a bit comparable to what we've seen in the third quarter of last year,"
"2776340","2781700"," where expectations again have been very, very low, but the reality has been 5% GDP growth. "
"2781700","2787580"," And of course, with those sort of very, very double expectations that we've got right now, I would"
"2787580","2793260"," argue, if we do get another sort of 3% plus quarter, that's some of those double expectations"
"2793260","2795900"," really are a bit exaggerated, I have to be pushed out."
"2796340","2801760"," And then that's what we call reverse goldilocks, where the higher yields really send a bit of pain"
"2801760","2802860"," across the asset market."
"2802860","2807960"," It's getting reflected in a lot of media here in the States where supplies given us a lot, maybe"
"2807960","2811260"," the next, you'd need to look to demand to help you out further. "
"2811760","2816920"," I am curious about your asset classes to avoid, including European equities."
"2817620","2818820"," What is that all about?"
"2819020","2823240"," How much is centered around, for example, the dip in UK retail sales last week?"
"2824220","2829840"," Yeah, I think overall in Europe, the absolute growth momentum, whether it's in the Eurozone or in"
"2829840","2832200"," the UK really still remains quite sluggish."
"2832960","2838780"," The advantage compared to 12 months ago is that growth expectations, both on the earnings side and"
"2838780","2843500"," on the top downside, are no longer as optimistic as they've been 12 months ago. "
"2843500","2849340"," Remember, 12 months ago, the consensus opinion was, you've got it by European equities because of"
"2849340","2855500"," the reopening in China and because the gas price crunch and all the gas crunch has abated, that of"
"2855500","2856780"," course didn't work out at all."
"2857020","2862160"," So, consensus expectations did come down, fair enough, but the absolute growth momentum still"
"2862160","2863240"," remains quite sluggish."
"2863760","2868840"," And one other thing that really should be weighing on European earnings going forward is the"
"2868840","2871460"," stronger sterling compared to three, four months ago. "
"2871460","2874440"," The stronger Europe compared to the dollar, both of them."
"2874980","2880520"," And of course, for export sensitive markets, like the UK and like the Eurozone, those stronger"
"2880520","2885180"," currencies in an environment of quite sluggish absolute growth momentum."
"2886100","2887240"," That is toxic, right?"
"2887500","2892580"," So then really the rally that we've seen in Q4 in Europe is not really on the sand footing, and"
"2892580","2894180"," we do expect a bit of a pullback there. "
"2894180","2899820"," It really does feel, in terms of the outlook for global growth this year, that it's lumpy and that"
"2899820","2901380"," it's not connected."
"2901860","2906120"," You know, there's this idea of coordinated growth and it doesn't, investors are pouring into Japan"
"2906120","2909180"," and the US, not so much Europe and China."
"2909520","2915220"," And I do wonder how those opportunities shake out and also how that sets up just global growth in"
"2915220","2916160"," particular this year. "
"2916160","2919460"," Yeah, I think global growth, you're absolutely right."
"2919600","2925240"," I think global growth of the cycle really is like, to be quite honest, at least what I haven't seen"
"2925240","2925760"," before, right?"
"2925900","2930520"," We know that, for example, look at manufacturing, even within manufacturing, there's these mini"
"2930520","2931540"," cycles going on."
"2931700","2936400"," We know chemicals are really struggling, altars are sort of trying to get out of door drums,"
"2936700","2940100"," whereas, you know, construction, particularly with you guys in the US is on fire. "
"2940100","2948840"," So even, you know, even those businesses or industries within a tiny sector like manufacturing are"
"2948840","2952620"," having these very independent stages of the cycle at the moment."
"2952920","2957080"," What I would say, you know, how you have to position right now, if we do get a bit of"
"2957080","2962640"," a really a reverse gold e-docs going where particularly US growth, which at the end of the day is"
"2962640","2964620"," the most, you know, that is the most important."
"2964620","2967740"," That is going to be the key factor, the key determinant. "
"2968560","2974540"," If we do indeed do surprise very, very strongly to the upside in the next couple of months on the"
"2974540","2977740"," activity data, that is particularly short duration assets, right?"
"2977860","2981840"," It's things like short duration or short dated IG credit."
"2982160","2988000"," It is, you mentioned Japan, Japanese equities are very heavily correlated to higher treasury yield"
"2988000","2989940"," to the stronger dollar as well."
"2989940","2995700"," So those ones really are quite good to go for latam equities as well. "
"2996100","3001060"," And in general, just a stronger dollar as well, particularly against some of the European risk"
"3001060","3001340"," currencies."
"3002160","3006640"," Indeed, and we're going to watch China very closely over the next few days for sure, Max."
"3007220","3009300"," Good insight on a host of topics. "
"3019400","3019920"," Appreciate it very much."
"3034960","3220970"," Thank you."
"3220970","3221350"," Welcome back. "
"3223030","3223450"," Let's talk retail."
"3223930","3227630"," How do luxury apparel brands differentiate themselves in an increasingly crowded retail"
"3227630","3228270"," environment?"
"3228710","3233050"," That was one of the many themes that dominated discussions last week with business leaders."
"3233050","3238130"," I sat down with the CEO of Ralph Lauren, Patrice Lube for an interview to talk about this as well"
"3238130","3243490"," as his outlook for 2024 and how endorsements and ad spend will define the winners and losers of"
"3243490","3244950"," retail for consumers this year. "
"3246530","3252370"," One of the challenges in this industry is to chase trends that might be very effective for three or"
"3252370","3252810"," four years."
"3253270","3257130"," And they're using some incredible companies kind of do that very well and then fall off a cliff"
"3257130","3261330"," because then the consumer really doesn't know exactly who you are anymore and what you stand for."
"3261330","3264210"," So, for us, what we do want to be fresh and relevant. "
"3264610","3268950"," We're also really, it's very important for us to stay consistent with what we stand for, what's our"
"3268950","3272670"," point of view, what's our philosophy, and I can't help you with that."
"3272770","3279630"," Is there any concerns developing around copyright or intellectual property that's what goes into"
"3279630","3280470"," some of these models?"
"3280570","3281470"," Yeah, I think that's a real question."
"3281630","3281850"," Absolutely. "
"3282970","3285610"," For example, we have 57 years of design history."
"3285970","3292090"," We actually have it captured in a library in New York City where we've kind of cataloged everything"
"3292090","3293850"," that's been created over the past 57 years."
"3295330","3297110"," That's gold for this company, right?"
"3297230","3298630"," It's really the foundation of this company. "
"3298770","3299690"," We want to make sure that's protected."
"3299890","3304210"," So that is a real issue as it is across many industries as we're talking here this week."
"3306330","3307910"," That's true, that's true in media as well. "
"3307910","3310470"," I think it's very important down the ground."
"3310670","3314750"," Yeah, I mean, it would be nice to see some sort of regulation or arrangement."
"3314890","3317490"," Yeah, we have to codify it. "
"3318370","3322310"," And there's clear will to do that and there's an absolute need to do that."
"3322450","3323750"," In the restaurant business as well."
"3324390","3327490"," Is that about branding or growth or what?"
"3327630","3329010"," That's about consumer engagement. "
"3329450","3333150"," So we have five restaurants around the world, just open one in Chengdu during very well."
"3333150","3335670"," We have 25 coffee shops around the world."
"3336310","3340850"," It's about giving consumers around the world the unappreciated discover and enter the world of"
"3340850","3341410"," Ralph Lauren. "
"3342310","3344670"," Differently than if they were going to do it through apparel."
"3345210","3350670"," So fun fact, we touch 2 million people every year with our hospitality propositions."
"3351690","3356330"," So a wonderful way to present the brands to consumers who actually discover us to cup of coffee in"
"3356330","3356570"," Shanghai. "
"3357070","3357790"," And then they go by."
"3357790","3362610"," And then we trade them up or we trade them across the portfolio."
"3362890","3365710"," We just launched preparation for the Olympics in Paris this summer. "
"3366210","3370170"," And as you know, we sponsor the US team coffee shop in Paris."
"3371730","3374470"," And after it was been a month after a wonderful start."
"3374630","3381050"," So the consumer, wherever we put it, whether that's in China, in Japan, in London, in New York,"
"3381430","3382430"," we're getting incredible response. "
"3382830","3384170"," And I think we're getting incredible response."
"3384410","3385750"," Not that we want to be in the coffee business."
"3386610","3390870"," But we want to be able to invite consumers into the Ralph Lauren world and this is an effective way"
"3390870","3391130"," to go. "
"3391130","3394710"," Speaking of consumer engagement, Taylor Swift wore Ralph Lauren on the top of the time."
"3394930","3397750"," Beyonce wore Ralph Lauren on the Renaissance tour."
"3398430","3401270"," JLo, the wedding, she's a Warren Ralph Lauren. "
"3402310","3405690"," Does this give you a material long-term boost?"
"3406970","3410570"," And did you initiate those relationships?"
"3410930","3411570"," Did you pay for that?"
"3412190","3414350"," So it is part of our marketing portfolio."
"3414710","3417910"," And as something you know, we've increased our marketing spending significantly over the past four"
"3417910","3419190"," or five years, more than doubled it."
"3420150","3424730"," That ranges from passion shows to sporting events to gaming, to partnerships with celebrities. "
"3425650","3427350"," They are friends of the brand, right?"
"3427550","3432690"," Because we're a very wary Ralph and I of seeing individuals kind of move from one brand to another"
"3432690","3434490"," driven by paychecks."
"3435890","3440530"," And whether that's JLo, Beyonce, you know, JLo reached out to Ralph for her wedding."
"3441790","3443970"," And Ben was also dressed in Ralph Lauren. "
"3444310","3444970"," Oh, I do know that."
"3445070","3445890"," Beyonce reached out."
"3445990","3446370"," I was with Ralph. "
"3446370","3447050"," I cared more about the draft."
"3447390","3448410"," Yes, well I look at both."
"3449450","3451790"," Beyonce reached out to Ralph for her Renaissance tour. "
"3452010","3455550"," I actually was with him in Colorado last summer when the conversation had started."
"3456530","3460470"," And then we were super excited to see that Taylor Swift decided to wear Ralph Lauren for the cover"
"3460470","3461110"," of Time magazine."
"3462030","3464750"," Not bad, Taylor Swift, Beyonce and JLo. "
"3465030","3467590"," You can find the full interview on the Money Mover's podcast."
"3467970","3470550"," You can subscribe wherever you get your podcast."
"3471550","3476170"," Fascinating sort of conversation about everything from the global economy to AI. "
"3476590","3481230"," And I think what you've got there is a taste of the sort of opportunities in terms of productivity"
"3481230","3485290"," and enhancing designers ability to use AI."
"3485550","3487170"," But then the copyright issues."
"3487170","3491770"," We know, for instance, the New York Times is suing chat GPT owner open AI. "
"3492310","3496670"," I mean, that transcends to the fashion world as well and protecting what he says their library that"
"3496670","3500350"," they have physically in New York of all the designs Ralph has ever made."
"3500650","3506410"," They have to be able to protect that both financially and sort of as a way to control the brand."
"3506690","3510570"," Yeah, journalists wonder how they're going to get paid for all their work and designers feel the"
"3510570","3510950"," same way. "
"3511190","3513250"," The strength on China is interesting."
"3513250","3515450"," Hong Kong China was up 25."
"3516210","3518930"," How do we square that with everything we've just been talking about the last two hours?"
"3519050","3524610"," Strong brands are doing well in China because it's not exactly, you know, I mean Burreal had a weak"
"3524610","3528190"," quarter in China and some of the other consumer companies as well. "
"3528370","3531050"," No, he said that China continues to be strong also for Ralph Lauren."
"3531330","3536790"," They're coming from a pretty low base in terms of they're seeing growth because it hasn't been in"
"3536790","3539170"," the Chinese market, for instance, in a big way."
"3539170","3545070"," But what you saw from Nike as well that China's growing not as fast as it once was. "
"3545390","3550790"," I think that it's not booming necessarily, but for brands that are strong and that have invested a"
"3550790","3554730"," lot and are still growing in China like a Ralph Lauren, he's very bullish on it."
"3555450","3558590"," Additionally, I spoke to a number of business leaders, including a Ramco CEO."
"3558830","3564610"," I mean, NASA, as we discussed how, for instance, one thing, the Red Sea disruptions are affecting"
"3564610","3565950"," the global or market right now. "
"3566070","3566930"," Here's what he says about this."
"3569170","3578570"," We do have an alternative routes while others don't have an alternative routes to bring their"
"3578570","3581050"," battles to the Red Sea."
"3581170","3583090"," I saw Qatar had a rerouted gas tanker. "
"3583950","3589430"," Unless you have pipelines, for example, we do have, as I said, a pipeline that will to meet our"
"3589430","3589690"," requirement."
"3589690","3598790"," However, there are certain products that would be impacted, but we do have ways of managing that."
"3599710","3600770"," That goes through. "
"3601010","3602070"," Just keep your eyes on this."
"3602750","3605090"," Find out if there's a rejection or not here on the spot."
"3605410","3608650"," If we don't reject, we should continue back to the upside. "
"3609010","3610770"," We are bouncing up right now."
"3610850","3612290"," How disruptive is that?"
"3612290","3620750"," It is disruptive in a way it continues for increasing the burden on having available tankers."
"3621490","3627890"," Because when you take two to three weeks more to deliver, the tanker is booked for a longer time. "
"3628050","3629310"," There's not enough tankers."
"3630410","3633530"," So, if you can continue, you can continue as a whole."
"3634130","3636670"," So, extend for a longer period of time. "
"3636850","3638490"," It will have an impact on supply chain."
"3638910","3641050"," Because you should not look only at oil and gas."
"3641430","3648150"," There is material, spare parts, equipment, goods that comes from there. "
"3648690","3649550"," That will have an impact."
"3650070","3659410"," So, with a lot of buildings on the companies and the industries, because they have to be higher"
"3659410","3661250"," cost, it will take longer."
"3662650","3664210"," Insurance prices goes up. "
"3664670","3668270"," So, a lot of implications for the industry."
"3669310","3672750"," You can watch my full conversation with Nasar at 8 p.m. Eastern tonight."
"3673070","3676730"," It's part of our CNBC leaders series from Davos airing all week long. "
"3677030","3681570"," I chose to play that part for you, Carl, because I know it's top of mind right now, for investors"
"3681570","3685610"," as these Houthi rebel attacks continue at a B.M. in back by Iran."
"3686090","3688610"," And it disrupts global shipping, including the oil trade."
"3688870","3689090"," Interesting. "
"3689610","3690690"," He says they're not effective."
"3690710","3691670"," They have an alternative route."
"3691990","3693910"," But, the longer it lasts, it's obviously disruptive. "
"3694510","3699090"," The bear argument is that there is new capacity coming online this year, but it's not tomorrow."
"3699630","3700330"," It's going to be a while."
"3700550","3702590"," What happens in the short term is going to be important. "
"3703390","3704810"," You need capacity for energy."
"3705010","3705770"," New freight capacity."
"3706050","3711510"," New shipping capacity that would still go around the corner, but would be more boats. "
"3711510","3716270"," More expensive too, I think, is the question, at least in the short term, until they can get there."
"3716810","3717250"," Fascinating."
"3717530","3719430"," What a point of view on such an important story. "
"3719870","3723210"," Later on this hour, the CEO of Marriott's going to reveal some new growth numbers."
"3723390","3725650"," Stocks up 40% in the last year."
"3726090","3727710"," And just mentioned the energy sector. "
"3728070","3731530"," Natural gas on pace for its fifth down session in the past six this morning."
"3732150","3735530"," Right now, falling, almost five and a half percent."
"3735730","3736350"," We're back in two minutes. "
"3930060","3935880"," In five minutes time now at the bottom of the hour, the US is due to sell $77 billion in"
"3935880","3941880"," three month bills with a prior high yield of five spot two to five percent and a private cover of"
"3941880","3942860"," two spot nine nine."

"3971160","3975720"," But our focus this morning turns to China with Beijing setting a five percent growth target for"
"3975720","3975980"," 2024."

"4103720","4106460"," The new high that we passed was mostly due to technology."

"4108680","4112020"," Energy was the biggest movement but remember energy is only 4% of the S&P."
"4112260","4114479"," Technology is about a quarter of the S&P 500."
"4114720","4116840"," Industrials also had a modest contribution as well. "

"4146319","4147520"," Not a lot of momentum elsewhere. "
"4147520","4151300"," One subgroup not paid a lot of attention to is insurance stocks."
"4151920","4157420"," Which on the back of travelers fantastic earnings last week where the pricing was much higher."

"4159439","4162340"," That's another new high for travelers today."
"4162700","4166620"," So there's your momentum there in technology and insurance stocks."
"4167220","4170040"," Elsewhere I keep waiting for oil stocks to bounce. "
"4170260","4173779"," I mean there's two oils to stock at $73 for ages and ages."
"4173779","4179520"," But these exploration production names like EOG down 9% on the month."

"4186340","4191319"," Marathon, Conoco, Chevron, really not going anywhere. "
"4191680","4193540"," It's kind of a major problem for the markets here."
"4193600","4194280"," I'd like to see some movement."
"4194680","4196460"," A little bit of excitement on the IPO front. "
"4196700","4198140"," Remember we got new highs on the market."
"4198420","4200380"," Some hope the IPO market will start opening up."

"4203940","4205880"," Amherst Sports is going to be here at the NYSE."
"4206400","4208820"," It's scheduled and this is not permanent."

"4212600","4214700"," This is one of the big international sports brands."
"4215640","4217020"," They won Wilson's Sporty Goods."
"4218160","4219680"," And it's going to be a fairly big deal. "
"4219800","4221040"," They just announced some of the terms here."
"4221280","4223780"," Looks like $16 to $18.00 million shares."
"4223980","4226320"," That's $1.7 billion IPO. "
"4226780","4229600"," It could be depending on where they go."
"4229800","4231980"," About an $8 billion overall market cap."
"4232080","4235380"," This would be one of the first significant IPOs since Birkenstock. "
"4235620","4236040"," Believe it or not."
"4236160","4236660"," Remember that, Sarah?"
"4236840","4237920"," It was way back in October."
"4238760","4240560"," So finally a little bit of excitement. "
"4240620","4241800"," And let's see."
"4242060","4242780"," There's a lot of names."
"4242840","4244460"," I got a trader talk this morning out folks. "
"4244660","4248980"," If you want to look trader talk.cmuc.com Listing some of the other potential hopefuls out there."
"4249140","4251220"," A long list, Sarah, as you well know."
"4251440","4251740"," Thank you. "
"4252040","4253680"," Yeah, I can see why the market would be opening."
"4253900","4254560"," I mean rates have stabilized."
"4254560","4256120"," But I'm just looking at Birkenstock. "
"4256280","4257920"," It's like $2.00 above its IPO price."
"4257920","4260920"," It had a really ugly reaction to earnings last week."
"4261320","4263960"," So that could give people an extra habitation. "
"4264400","4265820"," The IPO is down 8% this month."
"4265980","4267000"," But the market's at a new high."
"4267480","4269100"," So they're all hopeful. "
"4269560","4270200"," It's going to happen."
"4270440","4273880"," And we've been hopeful for two years that things are going to really start moving."
"4274120","4275880"," And it's just been a really rough time. "
"4276000","4280200"," The valuation haircuts last year killed a lot of these companies that are out there."
"4280200","4284780"," That's why companies like Reddit and everybody else are sitting out there waiting and waiting and"
"4284780","4285000"," waiting."
"4285320","4288500"," So let's see if we can finally get things going here with the markets at New Eyes. "
"4288760","4289920"," Maybe this will be the year."
"4290200","4290760"," Bob, thank you."
"4291040","4291440"," Bob Asani. "
"4291720","4292880"," Time now for news update."
"4293260","4294380"," HIPAA Stevens has that for us."
"4294500","4294740"," Hi, Bob. "
"4295040","4295340"," Hey Sarah."
"4295580","4300540"," The president is convening key members of his cabinet today to discuss abortion rights on what"

"4618660","4619660"," Take a look at Banco ZK."
"4619920","4625860"," Q4 results did beat estimates since shares higher last week, both loans and deposits up nearly 30%"
"4625860","4626340"," year on year. "
"4626700","4631800"," Joining us in a cmbc exclusive this morning, Bank of OZK CEO, George Gleason, oversees roughly 250"

"4636380","4637120"," Thanks for the time today."
"4638000","4638880"," Thank you, Carl. "
"4638980","4639840"," It's nice to be here."
"4639980","4644660"," A lot of discussion last few days about whether the regionals are sort of back in the loan"
"4644660","4645000"," business."
"4645580","4648220"," It sounds like you think growth is going to be fairly linear this year. "
"4649620","4651840"," Carl, we never left the loan business."
"4651840","4657960"," You know, the events that created so many headlines in March and April of last year."
"4658780","4665520"," You know, obviously showed a few months that were very unprepared for the interest rate"
"4665520","4669300"," environment, the economic environment they found themselves in. "
"4669740","4672900"," On the other hand, we were very well prepared."
"4673520","4679420"," And we had a great year last year, a record year in net income, and we had some up 23 "
"4679420","4683620","% record income in our needs for share up 29%."
"4683620","4687980"," So we continued business as usual all year long. "
"4688800","4695920"," And we had loan growth and deposit growth last year when many in the industry did not have growth."
"4696520","4701460"," Our loans and deposits grew over 27% each for the year."
"4701660","4704220"," So it was business as usual for us. "
"4704540","4710000"," The turmoil in the industry and the fact that a lot of banks were shrinking their balance sheets"
"4710000","4715280"," created a lot of opportunities for us to gain market share and gain customers."
"4715780","4720340"," And we were in extremely good position to capitalize on those opportunities."
"4721080","4721540"," Interesting. "
"4721780","4727200"," So how would you describe to the degree you're cautious about elements like construction or CRE"
"4727200","4727640"," loans?"
"4728240","4729340"," How cautious are you?"
"4730060","4736560"," Well, you know, we are probably the largest construction and development lender in the country"
"4736560","4739860"," where in every major market all the time."
"4740620","4749140"," And certainly commercial real estate is part of the economy that's facing a lot of challenges just"
"4749140","4751740"," because of higher interest rates."
"4752520","4756920"," But CRE and CRE lenders are very different. "
"4757780","4761220"," And different members of the capital stack have very different positions."
"4761220","4764240"," We're in every market in the country and every product type."
"4764980","4767420"," So we see that market really well. "
"4768300","4775880"," And certainly it's a challenging environment for equity because of rising costs to produce their"
"4775880","4785060"," projects and higher cap rates, higher interest rates and softening demand for rentals in some"
"4785060","4789540"," markets on some product types and for sales on some product types."
"4790320","4793040"," If you're in equity, it's been really challenging."
"4793040","4798640"," If you're somewhere else in the cap stack that's equity like, it's very challenging. "
"4799520","4801680"," We are a super low leverage lender."
"4802060","4809840"," Our average loan to cost on the projects we've financed is about 53% and our average loan to"
"4809840","4812740"," appraised value is about 43%."
"4812740","4819520"," And that significant amount of equity, real dollars equity around 47% on average. "
"4819900","4828280"," And on a price value about 57% equity on a price value gives us a significant cushion."
"4828520","4836540"," So we're able to continue to very actively engage with the market and serve our customers even in"
"4836540","4837200"," this environment."
"4837760","4839520"," We never leave commercial real estate. "
"4839840","4845160"," It makes you unique because you're growing the CRE loans in this environment and not seeing the"
"4845160","4849460"," kind of stress that we're seeing at the bigger banks on commercial real estate and office in"
"4849460","4849740"," particular."
"4850100","4855520"," George, I'm curious if you could just broaden out for us just in the major metro areas that you"
"4855520","4859080"," serve, what you're seeing on a macro level from businesses and consumers."
"4859280","4860640"," Are trends improving?"
"4861260","4862700"," Are they cooling off?"
"4863560","4864380"," What are you seeing?"
"4864780","4865120"," What's the outlook?"
"4865740","4868700"," I would say trends are challenging, Sarah. "
"4869700","4878600"," And it very much depends, you know, at the macro level on what sort of economic environment you're"
"4878600","4878740"," in."
"4879300","4882640"," You know, as I mentioned, we're in markets all over the United States."
"4882940","4890660"," So if you're in Florida or Texas, you've got economic tailwinds, demand tailwinds because those"
"4890660","4891780"," markets are growing. "
"4892620","4899700"," If you're in markets that are shrinking and having, you know, an outflow of businesses,"
"4899700","4905160"," particularly because it's not a favorable business environment, those markets are much more"
"4905160","4905520"," challenged."
"4906520","4911780"," Commercial real estate is very much an asset by asset basis."
"4911780","4917180"," You can generalize about it, but you get in trouble if you generalize. "
"4917520","4925340"," It's not just states, it's not just cities, it gets down to sub markets and even micro markets"
"4925340","4926560"," within those cities."
"4927360","4936780"," A new building, two blocks from a 25 year old building, it may have an incredibly different profile"
"4936780","4938860"," for leasing and functionality."
"4939560","4939580"," Yeah. "
"4939900","4941900"," It is extraordinarily complex."
"4942080","4945940"," We keep trying to remind viewers how many different slices you can take on CRE."
"4946560","4949180"," George, it's a great lens to understand a complex topic. "
"4949380","4949660"," Thank you."
"4949780","4950240"," Good to see you."
"4950800","4951420"," Thank you. "
"4951900","4952660"," Thanks, George."
"4953080","4957840"," Mariotte, Tony Cappelliano is with us after the break record year for expansion and room growth"

"4960040","4962080"," Stop the 40% in the past 12 months. "

"5181390","5182230"," Hash courses."
"5185170","5186030"," Welcome back. "
"5186250","5192430"," This morning, Mariotte announcing a record year of global signings with 52% more organic rooms"
"5192430","5194610"," signed in 2023 from last year."
"5194730","5199410"," Mariotte also highlighting strong net rooms growth of 4.7% last year."
"5199790","5203290"," Joining us now, tell me a sense of these numbers and what he's seeing from the Americas lodging"
"5203290","5207190"," investment summit in the United States. "
"5207190","5207990"," Well, Tony, it's great to have you."
"5208130","5208350"," Welcome."
"5209610","5210310"," Hi, Sarah. "
"5210450","5211230"," Thanks for having me."
"5211570","5214410"," So put these numbers, if you could, in perspective for us."
"5214410","5221630"," I think this is a higher rate of rooms added than you had originally forecast last quarter. "
"5221790","5224570"," What sort of growth does it represent for you going into this year?"
"5225930","5226410"," Yeah."
"5226630","5234090"," So the openings, the 4.7% net unit growth is a little higher than what we had guided and"
"5234090","5236830"," a little higher than consensus, which is terrific."
"5237210","5240990"," And it actually excludes the impact of the MGM transaction. "
"5241990","5245430"," We expect those rooms to come in sometime early this year."
"5246230","5252130"," What's just as exciting to me as the signings volume, as you pointed out in the open, our organic"
"5252130","5257030"," room signings last year were up 52% year over year."
"5257370","5258850"," We hit an all time record. "
"5258850","5267270"," We signed 164,000 new rooms and that excludes the impact of the city express acquisition we did"
"5267270","5271270"," last year, which added another 17,500 rooms."
"5271610","5274410"," So really strong growth momentum last year."
"5274930","5276170"," What does it speak to, Tony?"
"5276350","5282450"," Because I thought for a while there was kind of an inventory problem on hotels as, you know, banks"
"5282450","5288150"," were slow to land and it was just harder to build hotels and get them up and running harder for"
"5288150","5289510"," smaller hotels out there. "
"5289670","5290930"," So what does it speak to?"
"5291050","5291550"," What kind of environment?"
"5292990","5296370"," Well, it speaks to the continued resilience of travel."
"5296950","5299970"," It speaks to the confidence in the owner and franchise community."
"5300770","5305310"," And a year ago, I think there was some trepidation, particularly because of some of the"
"5305310","5309170"," constriction in the debt markets here at home and in Europe. "
"5309690","5313270"," But it's one of the reasons that conversions have become so important."
"5313810","5319550"," And in the numbers that you shared, about 25% of our openings last year were conversions."
"5320070","5324050"," And actually 40% of our signings came through conversions. "
"5324270","5330610"," And I think as we look into 24 conversions will continue to be a really important part of our"
"5330610","5331910"," growth story going forward."
"5332430","5334890"," So now will you be able to keep the demand?"
"5335350","5338390"," Will we see the kind of demand that we've seen in 2023 to fill those rooms?"
"5340010","5344890"," Yeah, so as you know, we saw about 9% rev-par growth in the third quarter."
"5344890","5348410"," We'll announce fourth quarter earnings right after Super Bowl. "
"5348970","5351630"," And Lini and I are really excited to share those numbers."
"5352210","5355150"," But the growth patterns that we're seeing are really encouraging."
"5355850","5358070"," Group continues to be really strong. "
"5358530","5360670"," We're not really seeing any slowdown in leisure."
"5361310","5365270"," And we continue to see slow and steady improvement in business transient."
"5365730","5369170"," So we're quite optimistic about continued demand growth. "
"5369850","5373510"," Tony, the streets taking a sharper view of airlines recently."
"5373510","5375290"," Now, there's a lot folded in there."
"5375750","5376610"," There's oil prices. "
"5377310","5378590"," There's some capacity issues."
"5378950","5381950"," Obviously mergers aren't going that smoothly on antitrust."
"5382390","5386890"," But do you think that has any impact on how the streets viewing lodging?"
"5388370","5391110"," Yeah, it's a good question, Carl. "
"5391350","5396830"," My guess is they're looking at the experience we saw in the early days of recovery from the"
"5396830","5397450"," pandemic."
"5397790","5404510"," When travelers perhaps were a little nervous about flying, we saw big uptick in the performance of"
"5404510","5405630"," drive to destinations."
"5406470","5412050"," And so even if there is some sense of weakness in the airline sector, they know how well"
"5412050","5415690"," historically our drive to destinations have performed. "
"5416730","5421690"," Does it feel to you like the spring and summer are going to be about domestic travel?"
"5422550","5426290"," Or are we counting on continued strength in transatlantic?"
"5426610","5428950"," And maybe some budding progress in transpacific?"
"5430230","5436250"," Yeah, it's a little early to say, although some of the early things I hear from our Caribbean team,"
"5436950","5439290"," the spring break numbers are really encouraging."
"5440230","5445870"," When you talk to our European team, I think they're pretty optimistic that we'll see another really"
"5445870","5452710"," strong group of numbers with transatlantic travel into Western European destinations."
"5454070","5458850"," When you talk about transpacific, China looks really encouraging. "
"5459150","5463870"," The question will be whether they continue to see strong cross-border travel."
"5464590","5469950"," A lot of the recovery that we've seen over the last couple quarters has largely been on the"
"5469950","5476750"," shoulders of domestic recovery, remains to be seen whether we see continued recovery in cross "
"5476750","5477150","-border."
"5477710","5483550"," And a lot of that will hinge on whether we see a return of those cross-border airline seats. "
"5483550","5491870"," At the end of last year, we'd only seen about 60% of the international airlift into China recovered"
"5491870","5493270"," a pre-pandemic levels."
"5494010","5496890"," Tony, I'm wondering what's happening on the jobs front."
"5497070","5500470"," You guys have been the jobs creator over the last year and a half. "
"5500730","5503470"," Obviously, the biggest jobs loser during the pandemic."
"5504090","5506970"," Have you hired back everyone you need to?"
"5507250","5508870"," And what does that look like going forward?"
"5508870","5513070"," Yeah, we're never really a full employment."
"5513610","5519430"," I can tell you in our biggest market here in the U.S. and Canada, essentially we're back to about"
"5519430","5521010"," where we were a pre-pandemic. "
"5521790","5527970"," Prior to the start of the pandemic, we were at a steady run rate of plus or minus 5,000"
"5527970","5529750"," job openings at any one time."
"5530110","5531930"," And that's about where we are today."
"5532410","5537850"," So we feel like we're essentially that we're back to pre-pandemic employment levels. "
"5537850","5539730"," And really quickly, what's the hottest part of the market?"
"5539890","5543910"," Is it luxury in terms of pricing and segment?"
"5544490","5545630"," Yeah, it's a good question."
"5546170","5548090"," I'm not sure it's a binary question."
"5548470","5554790"," Luxury continues to show great strength, but just last week I was in Fort Myers, Florida for the"
"5554790","5561550"," groundbreaking of the first studio res, which is our entry into mid-scale extended stay, and we're"
"5561550","5565850"," seeing extraordinarily strong demand in the mid-scale tier as well. "
"5565850","5571330"," So I think we're seeing strength in demand really across sectors and across price points."
"5572050","5575890"," Tony, thanks for joining us with a snapshot of the business, especially on those new numbers,"
"5575950","5580510"," helping our investors understand Tony Capiano from LA."
"5581390","5581530"," You too. "
"5582250","5585610"," When we come back, is there still room to run this year for tech?"
"5586150","5589730"," We'll look back to 1999 for some answers with money movers as back in two."
"5801680","5804140"," Big tech shaking off a rocky start to the year."
"5804400","5806040"," NDX hits a new all-time high Friday. "
"5806820","5811440"," And it's causing some to compare it to the tech-led stock market party of 1999."
"5812340","5814560"," Our Deirdre Bose is digging into that for today's tech check."
"5814780","5815100"," Morning, Dee. "
"5815460","5816100"," Good morning."
"5816240","5816760"," We've heard that before."
"5817040","5818060"," We're probably going to hear it again. "
"5818220","5823620"," But so far, at least, this moment of AI mania and text rally, it has nothing on the dot com"
"5823620","5823980"," bubble."
"5824160","5826040"," But it doesn't mean the Wall Street doesn't getting a little nervous."
"5826280","5831460"," So note from strategist Edgar Daney speaking the rounds, warns that potential fed easing risks"
"5831460","5833700"," fueling irrational exuberance. "
"5834460","5839740"," He even asks is NVIDIA's today's Cisco, noting that it's, quote, starting to remind us of the"
"5839740","5843730"," parabolic ascent of Cisco stock during the tech bubble of the 1990s."
"5844440","5845420"," So let's break that down."
"5845840","5850120"," NVIDIA would have a lot further to run before any kind of crash, which he does acknowledge. "
"5850500","5854700"," Back in 1999, Cisco had a price to earnings ratio of nearly 150."
"5855900","5861040"," NVIDIA's is currently 80, but it's forward PE based on expected earnings in the next fiscal year."
"5861200","5861560"," That's 50. "
"5862000","5868840"," Cisco's growth outlook back then was just 30% versus NVIDIA's expected growth this year at 119%,"
"5868840","5870880"," nearly 60% next year."
"5871000","5872980"," So yes, NVIDIA shares and we made this point before."
"5873380","5878220"," They have more than tripled last year, but that actually led the fundamental growth of the business"
"5878220","5879840"," earnings nearly quadrupled. "
"5880140","5885360"," Now, the question of irrational exuberance, however, may be more relevant in other areas of tech"
"5885360","5891600"," like software sector whose rally has been fueled arguably less by AI, more by the prospect of fed"
"5891600","5892120"," rate cuts."
"5892440","5893940"," And that is looking a little frothier."
"5894020","5900000"," The software ETF, the IGV, that's up 25% of the last three months and it's outperformed the broader"
"5900000","5901240"," NASDAQ this year. "
"5901700","5906020"," So while investors, they typically pay for growth and future profitability in these software names,"
"5906260","5908360"," growth estimates have come way down as well."
"5908720","5913060"," Rate cuts that could make those valuations look better, but it's unlikely to help the fundamentals,"
"5913620","5918720"," especially if AI spending accrues to new names, not yet public or the mega caps."
"5919220","5922480"," Lastly, guys, no sector has done better than semis this year. "
"5922700","5925040"," On that note, I leave you with Jensen Huang dancing in China."
"5925280","5927760"," I know you showed it early, but I can't get enough of it."
"5928740","5929360"," Counterpoint though. "
"5929480","5932480"," Let me just show you an AMD stock because I saw this as I was coming to air."
"5932840","5936420"," Those shares are down three and a half percent, kind of an outlier in the semispace today."
"5936540","5939880"," And that's on a note that said that AI spending may not be that big, it's going to be big,"
"5939880","5940620"," but not that big. "
"5940620","5944960"," And it's a good reminder what happens at these high expectations that if these companies,"
"5945060","5946480"," especially the semis, don't meet them."
"5947060","5949740"," Yeah, the year Denny knows that you mentioned is pretty interesting."
"5949920","5951760"," He's not giving it full probability. "
"5951760","5957480"," I think he's at the 20 percent probability, but he does say that the forward PE of TAC back in"
"5957480","5961360"," the 99 went to 50 or at about 26 right now."
"5962140","5964940"," In a way you could read that note is very bullish, right?"
"5965200","5968140"," Because that is a lot of room for the markets to run."
"5968140","5971720"," But a lot of participants, they're looking at what are the catalysts this year?"
"5972060","5976340"," There's generative AI, yes, but are we going to see more applications, especially with the Vision"
"5976340","5977140"," Pro coming out?"
"5977600","5978360"," And IPOs, right?"
"5978480","5979600"," Still an open question, guys. "
"5979820","5980820"," Which companies are going to go public?"
"5981180","5984780"," A trend that we've been following on tech check is private companies staying private, especially"
"5984780","5988920"," some of the most exciting ones and doing stock buybacks, letting employees cash out."
"5989020","5991020"," So that's still a big open question whether we see it."
"5991720","5993260"," All right, Deirdre, thank you, Deirdre Bosa. "
"5994180","5998980"," As we head out, Carl, it looks like we're holding the gains on the NASDAQ, where a record high is"
"5998980","6004900"," building on Friday's record close for the S&P, adding to gains, tech is leading, although it's"
"6004900","6008840"," pretty broad today in terms of sectors, real estate, for instance, at the top of the market."
"6009220","6014000"," We've got a lot this week on data, we have GDP, first look at the fourth quarter, we have PCE"
"6014000","6016600"," at the end of the week, a ton of earnings, the New Hampshire primary."
"6017280","6019180"," You know, I'm seeing more and more in the research notes. "
"6020580","6025180"," How a, well, after Iowa, Trump presidency, for instance, might impact the markets."
"6026040","6030040"," Usually, I think the old adges is investors kind of discount politics, they don't pay close"
"6030040","6032620"," attention to it, but that didn't happen in the last two elections."
"6032860","6037680"," Starting to draw some assumptions on the dollar and the pay so and a bunch of other things. "
"6038180","6039440"," We'll see what happens in New Hampshire tomorrow."
"6039660","6040140"," Let's get to the judge."
"6042800","6043880"," All right, Carl, thanks so much. "
"6044040","6044800"," Welcome to that time."
"6044940","6045120"," I'm Warren."
"6045220","6046520"," I'm Scott Walker from the center. "
"6046760","6049380"," He's now responding to record highs with some big names."
"6049400","6053300"," Once again on the move, we'll discuss and debate how to play the rally with the investment"
"6053300","6053600"," committee."
"6053600","6056620"," Joining me for the hour today, everybody here at Post 9."
"6056880","6057940"," Joe Turner of Anastasia. "
"6057940","6058640"," I'm a roso."
"6058920","6060160"," Jason Stein, Jim Labenthal."
"6061000","6061880"," Let's take you to the markets. "
"6062480","6063560"," We are in the green across the board."
"6064220","6065380"," Down top 38,000."
"6065420","6065900"," Sorry about that. "
"6066080","6066420"," I'm watching."
"6066500","6072840"," You say this is the moment of transport for the rotation argument because what looked like it was"
"6072840","6077540"," going to have some staying power at the end of 23 hasn't really worked out that well so far in"
"6077540","6077840"," 24."
"6078440","6079660"," That's exactly right, Scott. "
"6080060","6083940"," You know, and let me start by saying, all right, we're in an area where I don't feel anybody,"
"6083940","6088340"," including myself, that's going to do a Jason Kelsey here and rip off their shirt to celebrate their"
"6088340","6088800"," brother's touchdown."
"6089260","6090560"," It just doesn't feel that way."
"6090680","6091300"," Now, why is that?"
"6091560","6092260"," Why is that?"
"6092380","6095740"," Is because the equal weight, the small caps have not participated year to date. "
"6096080","6100100"," So, yes, you've got a new high, but it's the same Mag 7 that's leading the way."
"6100440","6103260"," In order for that to broaden out, this is the moment of truth."
"6103500","6107000"," Earnings need to prove that the broadening of the rally is deserved. "
"6107400","6111080"," The broadening of the rally is not going to happen on rate cuts and the debate whether it's 6, 5,"
"6111380","6111660"," 4, 3."
"6111660","6113320"," That's not what's going to broaden the rally."
"6113820","6115300"," Earnings are going to broaden the rally."
"6115580","6120060"," And if you don't get them, then this new high feels a lot like winning a football game because your"
"6120060","6122680"," opponent missed the last minute field goal wide-right. "
"6122840","6127460"," If you happen to be over exposed to cyclical names, it feels like that."
"6128140","6132580"," If you, you know, dance with Ubrungia and you're in these magazines like that."
"6132600","6135940"," Now, I'm meeting with attorneys this morning and then I'm working on Viscour. "
"6136140","6137660"," Hold on, we got to do a roll."
"6137660","6138780"," Hold on, we got to do a roll."
"6138940","6139160"," Right. "
"6139400","6140740"," Well, so far, you'll look at the market for 4 days."
"6140780","6141840"," I'm trying right now."
"6141940","6142800"," I'm going to leave this here. "
"6142800","6144500"," You're right back to the playbook of 23."
"6146620","6147540"," So I have to work."
"6147760","6149620"," So we're supposed to be launching on the 31st. "
"6151060","6157440"," And when you have a free Discord, you attract scammers, scammers, bots, all kinds of stuff like"
"6157440","6157660"," that."
"6158960","6166140"," So we have to do a roll into a new Discord that basically wipes all of that, all those scammers"
"6166140","6166500"," out."
"6166500","6170840"," So I'm looking for, I have to do an oath thing and all this other kind of stuff and have"
"6170840","6171980"," a ready to rock for you to go. "
"6175260","6180360"," And Scott, what I say is the bar is set low for earnings across the board outside of financials."
"6180560","6185160"," For example, typically you do cut back earnings estimates by about 3 or 4 percentage points leading"
"6185160","6186280"," up to the start of the quarter."
"6186820","6191840"," This time we cut them back by 6.8%. So I think the bar is low and in the next"
"6191840","6196880"," couple of weeks we've got communication services, consumer discretionary tech sectors that will be"
"6196880","6201600"," reporting, and they're not reporting a negative 18% earnings decline, like we see for financials,"
"6201660","6204740"," but a positive 18 or in some cases 41%. "
"6204740","6209340"," We stay with this idea that we're going to get this rotation or at what point do we abandon ship"
"6209340","6209720"," on that?"
"6210920","6212260"," It's an important question to ask."
"6212440","6216520"," I think, you know, I think a couple points that are already made in terms of the beat rate."
"6216760","6218840"," So the beat rate, earnings haven't been great. "
"6218960","6220520"," There's only been a 62% beat rate."
"6220940","6222580"," The average is 77%."
"6223120","6230380"," We do need the other 493%, 493 companies of the S&P 2 to participate and really start to"
"6230380","6230600"," grow. "
"6231300","6234120"," Semi's are up 7% right in the year to date."
"6234460","6238780"," A lot of that is on the back of some of the Taiwan semi guide and report."
"6239180","6243160"," So for me, yes, we're going forward. "
"6243360","6245720"," We have 15% of the S&P to report this week."
"6246440","6250860"," We'll see how that develops, but we absolutely need to see broader participation."
"6250860","6253400"," You've been looking at this from the beginning of year. "
"6253740","6253880"," Yes."
"6254080","6258280"," Wondering if all of this talk about broadening is just talk and it's not going to actually happen."
"6258480","6258680"," Okay. "
"6258840","6262320"," So compare S&P value versus S&P growth on earnings expectations."
"6263140","6271040"," S&P value doesn't see double digit year on year revenue growth until the end of 2024 at best."
"6271700","6274520"," S&P growth, double digit growth is there. "
"6274800","6280460"," It's evident and in fact that double digit growth goes into the 20 to 25 to 30% range."
"6280900","6282620"," So that's where the clear growth is."
"6283020","6287740"," I think really what shook that narrative was the backup and yields. "
"6288180","6294660"," The backup and yields drove a lot of capital back into the quality factor, drove capital back"
"6294660","6295880"," towards the mega caps."
"6296620","6299260"," And you would have to see, I think, a reversal."
"6299580","6302220"," You would have to see yields return in particular the 10 year. "
"6302420","6307520"," You've got to get that 10 year back down to about three and three quarters to ignite some of the"
"6307520","6308860"," Q4 type of price action."
"6309100","6314520"," Well, see, that's why, you know, Jan Hazzias over at Goldman says first cut to your point is"
"6314520","6315200"," happening in March."
"6316100","6320460"," David Costen there says lower rates are going to just continue to fuel this appetite for growth"
"6320460","6320700"," stocks. "
"6321020","6321360"," Yeah."
"6321600","6322480"," I think they are."
"6322560","6326540"," And the point that David actually specifically makes that it's not just growth stocks, but stocks"
"6326540","6331180"," can continue to grow in terms of their return on equity and can continue to grow into their"
"6331180","6335740"," profitability when you are in an environment where you are on certain where the economy is headed,"
"6335920","6337740"," you go to where the highest profit margins are. "
"6337900","6341780"," And when you have this perceived safety of margins and that's got why people blocked the"
"6341780","6342480"," magnificent seven."
"6342940","6349600"," But now if you think we might have fed easing on the table, then you start going to stocks that"
"6349600","6353860"," may have higher leverage, have lower growth today, but higher expected growth in the future."
"6354260","6355100"," So that's David's point. "
"6355200","6355720"," David's point."
"6355820","6356760"," I'm sympathetic to that."
"6356920","6361600"," And we've been looking at the Goldman Sachs and profitable tech basket, which so far is down 15%"
"6361600","6362160"," for the year. "
"6362160","6365720"," But I think at some point that catch up trade is going to start working again."
"6366020","6367820"," Apple remains the place to look."
"6369280","6372900"," So three downgrades in the last two, three weeks. "
"6373340","6373460"," Yes."
"6373780","6378760"," Do you remember, you know, prior to this string of downgrades, you know, a few months ago, Apple"
"6378760","6382680"," got downgraded and we joked on the show, like, okay, that marked the near term bottom for that one."
"6382840","6382980"," Yes. "
"6383220","6388760"," And then, you know, Apple comes roaring back off of that down grade, and then it gets these three"
"6388760","6392200"," downgrades and stocks looking dicey."
"6392440","6394020"," Technically, it's kind of messed up."
"6394680","6398020"," The last one was Redburn Atlantic, downgrading it to neutral. "
"6398140","6399420"," What happens from there?"
"6399680","6401060"," Stocks pushing back towards 200."
"6401460","6402820"," Mark the bottom once again."
"6403240","6408040"," It's remarkable because if you look at the S&P 500 year to date, which I did this morning, 71 "
"6408040","6414240","% of the S&P 500 is under performing the overall performance year to date for the S&P. "
"6414460","6421740"," And going beyond that, actually 61% of the stocks in the S&P 500 are negative on the year."
"6421860","6429420"," So you take a stock like Apple and you try to insert this negative sentiment towards it in the face"
"6429420","6435520"," of very, very strong fundamentals and strong fundamentals, not just from the standpoint of"
"6435520","6440240"," earnings, which have been relatively flat, but just the ability to buy back their own stock."
"6440480","6444540"," And what's interesting about the rally over the last several days is remember, it's happening at a"
"6444540","6449000"," time where in a blackout period for corporations to buy back their stock, which is another"
"6449000","6449820"," compelling case. "
"6449820","6457960"," But I think Apple is just a classic example of not trying to push against the overall momentum in"
"6457960","6458340"," the market."
"6458460","6460500"," And the momentum in the market is incredibly strong."
"6460900","6466320"," And the momentum in the market is being captured by a lot of non-discretionary funds. "
"6466620","6471500"," And I really want to highlight that because I don't think people understand how the market"
"6471500","6480460"," structure has changed so dramatically to where now you have algorithms, you have non-discretionary"
"6480460","6484700"," capital that really is the overwhelming driver of where the market goes."
"6484880","6491080"," And I think Apple is a clear example of being a beneficiary of that type of non-discretionary"
"6491080","6491280"," momentum."
"6491560","6496360"," You could make the argument, Jason, that the time to be negative Apple was when it was going to"
"6496360","6498340"," head down into the 160s. "
"6498420","6501380"," Like the high 160s is where it got back to."
"6501840","6503880"," Now it's rallying back once again."
"6504020","6506700"," And we have the parade of downgrades in the last couple of weeks today. "
"6507000","6507860"," Not so much."
"6507960","6509740"," Bernstein reiterates it as market perform."
"6510220","6513620"," Bank of America says AI could drive Apple to outperform in 2024. "
"6514080","6518800"," Stronger upgrade cycle coming driven by the need for the latest hardware to enable generative AI"
"6518800","6519260"," features."
"6519540","6520440"," So that's their call there."
"6520860","6521280"," Yeah. "
"6521460","6525500"," So I think for me, you pointed it out, scattering, three downgrades."
"6525840","6525940"," Right."
"6526060","6527760"," And then you see obviously the price action that we saw. "
"6527780","6529120"," It's rare that you see one downgrade."
"6529540","6529700"," Okay."
"6529920","6530780"," And the guide of a week. "
"6531260","6531760"," You got it."
"6532140","6532680"," Or eight days."
"6532960","6535160"," From January 2nd to January 10th you got three. "
"6535640","6536520"," A hundred percent."
"6536660","6538940"," And then they lose the position as a largest company in the world."
"6539180","6539200"," Right. "
"6539340","6542800"," And then Microsoft obviously takes the lead, which obviously Microsoft's price action has been"
"6542800","6543120"," strong."
"6544380","6549480"," But again, I think for me as a relates to Apple, you know, a couple weeks ago as a source"
"6549480","6554780"," of funds, you know, you get the upgrade and you know, there's no longer concerned about the"
"6554780","6556300"," multiple 29 times forward."
"6556520","6559160"," Kafka is no longer an issue supply chain's upgrade cycle. "
"6559340","6562520"," We hear about the glass is 180,000 pre-order sold."
"6563120","6563240"," Right."
"6563240","6566560"," So I think it's just benefiting from the momentum in the tech space. "
"6567000","6567660"," As rates pull back."
"6567760","6568660"," Got the watch drama."
"6569000","6573000"," You have some potential regulatory issues, DOJ, all these reports coming out. "
"6573280","6579280"," It's like, okay, the stock doesn't seem to pay much attention to it over the last, you know,"
"6579380","6585220"," several days, looking ahead probably the earnings and figuring that the negative part of the story"
"6585220","6588220"," is trough through consecutive quarters of negative revenue growth."
"6588220","6589280"," That's in the rear view."
"6590020","6591760"," Smartphone market was weak globally. "
"6591760","6593860"," People believe that's going to be troughing as well."
"6594360","6598500"," Look, I'm not a big believer in there's a huge catalyst out there to move Apple higher."
"6598800","6598960"," Okay. "
"6599040","6602280"," I know some people are putting the vision where goggles out there as the catalyst."
"6602440","6602760"," That's fine."
"6602840","6604520"," You can make a market on anything you want to. "
"6604740","6605740"," I just don't believe that."
"6605840","6608040"," I think this is more and I'm going at you Joe with this."
"6608260","6610120"," This is more going to respond to the market overall. "
"6610440","6614440"," Animal spirits are turned and people are coming back to the market right now just by definition."
"6614440","6617720"," Those nondiscretionary buyers that you're talking about have to go to Apple."
"6617720","6620860"," If you're anywhere exposed to the S&P 500 or the triple Q's. "
"6620860","6624480"," Now what I think is interesting here and I'm going to dovetail to something you said about the"
"6624480","6624820"," algorithms."
"6625440","6629180"," Because I said this to you on the area yesterday in rhetorical or last week and I didn't quite get"
"6629180","6629540"," an answer."
"6629840","6630340"," What happens?"
"6630560","6631540"," We were talking about interest rates. "
"6631600","6633220"," You were talking about interest rates a second ago."
"6633480","6636840"," What happens when the yield curve all of a sudden disinverts?"
"6637240","6641200"," I think those algos just to answer the question are now going to pile on and I think that's going"
"6641200","6641580"," to happen."
"6641700","6646260"," So I hear you on hey we'd like to have the tenure at three and three quarters but I don't"
"6646260","6646640"," think so. "
"6646840","6647940"," I think you want to get it higher."
"6648420","6653160"," Maybe the two here comes off a little bit but when that yield curve uninverts I think the algos are"
"6653160","6653800"," going to pile on."
"6653920","6654780"," It's going to benefit Apple. "
"6654860","6656220"," It's going to benefit everybody in the market."
"6656360","6660720"," Let me ask you all this because Friday's big story that we did was Stephanie Link selling meta."
"6661340","6670080"," She looks at the incredible price appreciation Joe of a stock like that and it's like look I love"
"6670080","6670320"," it. "
"6670620","6674920"," It's just I'd be crazy not to take some profits just given what the move's been."
"6675020","6679960"," So I'm like well what about other big winners from November 1st that you guys are all in."
"6680480","6683240"," Crowd strikes up 70% since November 1st. "
"6683320","6684560"," Ubers up 50%."
"6684560","6686560"," There are other names on the list which we'll get to as well."
"6686940","6690840"," But these are growth names which have ripped. "
"6691940","6698680"," Well you never say never in terms of looking at a particular position realizing that it's been a"
"6698680","6705280"," significant contributor to your portfolio and saying okay do I need to reduce the allocation to"
"6705280","6707800"," this individual equity to manage the risk."
"6707800","6711240"," So there's always that possibility that exists in the case of Uber."
"6711700","6714720"," That's in fact what I did towards the end of 2023. "
"6715040","6718100"," I paired back because I had a significant gain in the stock."
"6718420","6719560"," I paired packed the holding."
"6720200","6726980"," In the case of Crowd Strike there's a very strong thesis, a fundamental thesis and a tailwind"
"6726980","6728800"," surrounding cyber security. "
"6729280","6730300"," And I think that's well entrenched."
"6731180","6734280"," It's clearly so for then a dominant theme in 2024."
"6734280","6741900"," And what would be the motivating factor for me to consider reducing the holding in Crowd Strike is"
"6741900","6747540"," to see a reversal of that trend both in terms of the technicals themselves. "
"6748360","6753460"," But really in fundamentals really beginning to hear the earning story looking like it's"
"6753460","6754280"," decelerating."
"6754620","6757860"," And if you do get that type of evidence then yeah you have to pair back the position."
"6758060","6760080"," But until it does that I'm going to stay with it. "
"6760120","6766560"," Jimmy stocks are right in the wheelhouse of his argument slash concern about the broadening of the"
"6766560","6772240"," market because the cyclical names that he's betting big on like you know Greenbrier for example is"
"6772240","6774220"," up 30% since November 1st."
"6774380","6776720"," GM is up 27%."
"6776720","6778680"," You know I'm not much news. "
"6779020","6784920"," Thermo Fisher is up 25% if your test so to speak right."
"6785440","6787300"," Call this a test for these stocks."
"6787900","6791220"," If that fails what do you do with these names. "
"6791220","6792620"," I think you got to trim them."
"6793220","6796520"," I mean this is the moment of truth to go back to where we started this."
"6796660","6800560"," Now Greenbrier I'll just point out there on an off cycle as far as when their calendar year end so"
"6800560","6801740"," they reported a few weeks ago. "
"6802080","6803780"," Pretty good earnings report by the way."
"6803880","6806420"," Now that's a look it's a small cap stock it makes rail cars."
"6807160","6811720"," Rail cars it's pretty cyclical okay so that's a good indication but again it's a small cap you"
"6811720","6816300"," can't you can't you know derive from that that the overall cyclical economy is doing well as much"
"6816300","6817160"," as I may want to. "
"6817420","6820060"," GM on the other hand is a major moment of truth."
"6820060","6825180"," It's up whatever you said 27% a lot of that I think is the accelerated share repurchase where"
"6825180","6827700"," they're buying back about 20% of the company."
"6827980","6831880"," Now they wouldn't be doing that if they didn't feel good about their prospects but those prospects"
"6831880","6836040"," needs to shine through not just in the fourth quarter reports but the guidance going forward. "
"6836380","6841420"," The stock is still ridiculously cheap it's less than five times earnings so you know if I'm right"
"6841420","6845300"," and I think I am about the broadening of the economy excuse me the broadening of the rally on the"
"6845300","6846560"," back of economic strength."
"6846820","6847700"," GM will do well."
"6848420","6851960"," Thermo Fisher you know I would say this is more of a sector call I think a lot of us"
"6851960","6855600"," have talked about health care being this year being the year for health care was a terrible year"
"6855600","6856100"," last year. "
"6856520","6860720"," Thermo Fisher is one of the highest quality companies in the health care sector a little pricey"
"6860720","6866020"," I'll admit that but let's see if this near term momentum can run along with the sector as people as"
"6866020","6867160"," sentiment comes back to it."
"6867280","6872560"," All right so we mentioned what Apple is doing pushing back towards 200 bucks in videos hitting an"
"6872560","6876140"," all-time high because chips have been crushing it best sector this year semiconductors."
"6876480","6881880"," That after having their best year the SMH at least in 20 years last year Christina Parts and Evelos"
"6881880","6886460"," joins us now because key bank reiterates and videos overweight you've got some other calls in the"
"6886460","6889380"," space but your B has been going crazy. "
"6891000","6894920"," I know and I just happened to take a few days off during all of this but let's start with"
"6894920","6899740"," AMD because it seems like it's a little bit less optimistic analysts at Northland Capital are"
"6899740","6904820"," saying hold your horses on AI yes it's big but it's not as big as investors are thinking which is"
"6904820","6911320"," why they are downgrading AMD on valuation to a quote heck if we know rating they believe right now"
"6911320","6915740"," AMD's AI earnings potential is just too inflated at the moment that's how you can see shares are"
"6915740","6921040"," down slightly but not the case for Nvidia that stock is up what 25% year to date after 240 "
"6921040","6927840","% ride last year speaking of Nvidia Nvidia CEO Jensen Wong just made his first visit to China in"
"6927840","6933340"," four years just over the weekend it's unclear who he met but the visit does highlight Nvidia's"
"6933340","6938920"," concerns about US chip restrictions and this growing competition from local alternatives like"
"6938920","6944080"," Huawei he also visited Taiwan to meet with Taiwan semiconductor to secure production capacity for"
"6944080","6950440"," its current upcoming its current and upcoming AI chips but not everyone thinks Nvidia is number one"
"6950440","6958140"," for 2024 Morgan Stanley is replacing Nvidia with Western digital as its top pick with a new price"
"6958140","6964140"," target of 73 bucks and that's why it's pushing shares higher right now over 4% and the analyst Joe"
"6964140","6969620"," Moore says the stock is dirt cheap and NAN prices which is really just the memory is not associated"
"6969620","6974600"," with AI so just think of it as a separate type of memory and he said those prices are ripping"
"6974600","6979520"," higher and then the major catalyst who is in the second half of this year Western digital will"
"6979520","6985060"," separate its NAN business from its hard disk drive a K the storage business which should unlock"
"6985060","6991460"," additional value so that's why they're upgrading Western digital and in replacing it instead of"
"6991460","6991700"," Nvidia."
"6992640","6997020"," Jason you want to chat about what's been going on with Nvidia of late."
"6997800","7001360"," I mean I remember the stock has just been incredible. "
"7001880","7002940"," You pick without a purlative."
"7003800","7008080"," You're the shareholder and you tell me how you're feeling about this move whether you think it's a"
"7008080","7009920"," little too much whether it's really justified."
"7011280","7017340"," Yeah every time I say that it keeps going higher right so the stock to Christina's point up 240%"
"7017340","7024420"," last year 2020 plus percent this year you know think about think about the meta move 300,000 chips"
"7024420","7030220"," that they bought right so the demand is extremely robust 300,000 H100 right and they're still"
"7030220","7035620"," innovating there on top of that bill so for me the semi-space a cyclical space they call them the"
"7035620","7037820"," new transports all these things that we've talked about forever. "
"7039320","7043200"," It's very much in play and I continue to think there's upside momentum there."
"7043380","7043800"," Yeah Joe."
"7044460","7049360"," The concern I look Nvidia is nothing more than a reflection of what Jimmy's talking about with the"
"7049360","7050020"," animal spirit. "
"7050020","7055920"," It's a strong positive momentum and really the desire for ownership of quality within the market."
"7055920","7057380"," We all know where AI is."
"7057600","7062960"," The set up with semis this week is somewhat concerning when you think about well where do we kick"
"7062960","7064240"," off semi earnings. "
"7064240","7067380"," We've got Texas Instruments and then we'll hear from Intel."
"7067740","7071200"," Texas Instruments has had five quarters of struggles."
"7071720","7073300"," There's a week on that one too right?"
"7073540","7073560"," I did. "
"7073860","7074020"," I did."
"7074460","7080200"," Week demand for industrial equipment analog is going to be down double digits once again so the set"
"7080200","7085500"," up for semis this week can be a little bit complicated when you're hearing some of the fundamental"
"7085500","7091000"," stories that certainly aren't going to sound as good as what you hear from AI, AMD in video."
"7091220","7093300"," That's a good distinction Christina isn't it?"
"7093300","7102640"," The tale of two chip kind of segments whether it's on semi Texas Instruments and XPI versus the"
"7102640","7104420"," others that are getting all the live life. "
"7105620","7110900"," Yeah and it's a great point by Joe just because auto sector is also a concern so that's weighed on"
"7110900","7117280"," on semi and a few other like an XPI Texas instrument is exposed to EVs but not so much they're"
"7117280","7122140"," more diversified so it seems like some analysts are saying hey the bottom may have hit four Texas"
"7122140","7126080"," instruments despite you know the five quarters of potential weakness."
"7126460","7131880"," There's still some mixed reviews on Intel but if I may just bring it back to Nvidia the thesis that"
"7131880","7138100"," Northland capital had on AMD they are arguing that there's a lot of stockpiling happening with"
"7138100","7138960"," these AI chips."
"7139260","7145020"," China is going to slow down its demand in Q3 once they you know they buy all their chips and"
"7145020","7148200"," start using alternatives so I wonder why that thesis isn't used for Nvidia. "
"7148880","7153800"," Let's say you know beyond the second half of this year and why there isn't maybe more concern that"
"7153800","7156560"," this may taper off by the end of 2024."
"7157520","7161960"," Well we'll have to wait and see what happens with their guidance and what the analyst community has"
"7161960","7162480"," to say about it."
"7162540","7164420"," Christina thank you I appreciate it Christina parts and levels. "
"7164840","7170380"," It's a perfect segue to you know talk about stocks going wild and some of these names that have"
"7170380","7171040"," gone crazy."
"7171680","7179200"," We just got green light capitals annual letter two investors David Einhorn of course who says that"
"7179200","7185280"," they returned 22.1 percent last year net of fees and there's a line in here towards the top that"
"7185280","7187280"," I think sets up this conversation pretty well."

"7192220","7196280"," until the last couple of months when the market took off and most of our short book performed"
"7196280","7202280"," poorly bubble light conditions returned for the most speculative stocks and a handful of our shorts"

"7204120","7211140"," He's known as somebody who certainly wasn't trying to you know jump on these crazy growth stocks."
"7211440","7216280"," He has always had or at least for the last at least handful of years this so-called bubble basket"
"7216280","7222120"," of names that you know went against him and then for him when they you know had a really rough"
"7222120","7224060"," year a year ago."
"7224260","7228300"," So he talks about these speculative stocks going parabolic. "
"7228920","7234660"," Edgar Denny has a note guys out today in which he talks about an exuberant melt up phase."
"7235580","7241400"," Talking about which already might be underway and might become irrational so two smart market"
"7241400","7247620"," watchers one great overall market participant throughout the years in David Einhorn went through"
"7247620","7252560"," rough patch but has bounced back from that what do we make in the stage of some of this commentary"
"7252560","7258140"," speculative stocks even you know Edgar Denny who's as bullish as anybody on this market talking"
"7258140","7264120"," about an exuberant melt up I talk about Apple coming back towards two I talk about Nvidia ripping"
"7264120","7266100"," higher among these other semiconductor names."
"7266380","7270600"," Yeah I mean if there's nothing to get in the way of the exuberance why can't the market continue to"
"7270600","7275320"," roll on and when I think about the setup right now we talked about earnings that maybe started on a"
"7275320","7280380"," weak basis but I think that broadens out and earnings can be a catalyst for markets you know then"
"7280380","7285320"," we talk about elections people maybe sort of start to worry about it but guess what stocks actually"
"7285320","7291400"," typically go up in election years more often than not 85% of the time and then you talk about"
"7291400","7296420"," Fed easing you know whether we want to debate whether it's March or May or June the bias for the"
"7296420","7301420"," Fed right now is to ease policy so I call it the three E's the elections the earnings the easy"
"7301420","7305620"," I think all of that right now is on the side of the market and there was an interesting note"
"7305620","7311400"," Scott today from Tony Pascarello where he talked about that the Fed is now talking about cutting"
"7311400","7317560"," rates but investors are also starting to think about what happens with tax cuts from the Trump era"
"7317560","7322860"," and whether they start to get extended so I think for now the market has a lot to support it"
"7322860","7329180"," you know one of these stocks who would have said fits right into this basket over the years was"
"7329180","7336920"," Netflix right and you know Jason you own it remember the stock was at 700 had this you know huge"
"7336920","7342960"," decline down to what four less less than that yeah well it's back towards five okay and it reports"
"7342960","7348360"," earnings tomorrow which has always been a key moment for the bank stocks Julia Borsten joins us now"
"7348360","7353640"," with what the setup looks like hey Julia well Scott Netflix is expected to deliver accelerating"
"7353640","7358940"," revenue growth and subscriber editions pretty much in line with last quarter's surprise beat that's"
"7358940","7364920"," nearly nine million that's how many new subscribers analysts are projecting for Q4 that would bring"
"7364920","7372780"," Netflix's paid membership to 256 million now the other key number to watch is 11% that's the"
"7372780","7378300"," accelerating revenue growth that Netflix forecast for the quarter both numbers reflect success"
"7378300","7385140"," converting freeloaders to paid subscribers as well as advertising upside after Netflix announced 23"
"7385140","7391040"," million ads supported subscribers they know that just earlier this month as rival streamers focus"
"7391040","7397120"," on profitability Netflix's lead is seen as giving it an even greater advantage to license others"
"7397120","7403800"," content and ultimately spend less on content now despite the 36% run up in Netflix share since its"
"7403800","7410120"," last earnings 60% of analysts have a buy rating 34% have a hold and only 6% have"
"7410120","7414080"," a sell Scott all right Julia thanks so much that's Julia Borsten should of course be all over the"
"7414080","7419360"," network tomorrow as we look ahead to that and then we report the earnings in OT so mark Mahaney"
"7419360","7425700"," speaking of what Julie was saying still some wind left in the sales he says what do you think I"
"7425700","7434140"," think so I think Scott for me as a as relates streaming is always on the streaming has been slowing"
"7434140","7441440"," some 9 million is a very solid number right and when I think about how they're monetizing that"
"7441440","7447060"," existing base you know you've talked about 23 million ad support here new members right so these"
"7447060","7452760"," are folks that maybe are in the space where we're sharing some somebody else's subscription and"
"7452760","7457880"," then you're talking about the password share so I think there is continued upside on the existing"
"7457880","7462400"," base the free cash vote continues to grow I think the one concern for me though is what happened"
"7462400","7466160"," with the strike there's not been a lot of new releases the content library is strong there's not a"
"7466160","7471000"," lot of new releases this year so we'll see how it goes yeah so the momentum is clearly back in"
"7471000","7476220"," Netflix but this is a quarter where I don't know if it's as much the technicals as the fundamentals"
"7476220","7480620"," that's going to drive the direction I think what's going to be important is the operating margin"
"7480620","7486540"," returning the operating margin back into the mid 20's and then also gaining an understanding coming"
"7486540","7492300"," off the Hollywood strike which ended in the early weeks of October okay what's the cost effect now"
"7492300","7500160"," on Netflix as we move forward because the writers obviously are going to be receiving more and"
"7500160","7504580"," that's going to weigh on those margins themselves so I think that fundamental elements can be"
"7504580","7510540"," really important to understand as they give us a little bit of a road back into 2024 we got a"
"7510540","7515540"," lot of other names on the earnings list for this week and we'll try and get through those before"
"7515540","7518740"," the end of the show today because we do have a lot of ownership on the desk don't put that"
"7518740","7522740"," aside we'll take a quick break we do have more stocks on the move that the committee owns we're"
"7522740","7526260"," going to talk trades on city and D.R. Horton Lulu and more we'll do it next. "
"7529880","7679130"," All right"
"7679130","7694790"," we're back"
"7694790","7700770"," let's hit some committee names that are on the move today let's talk city Jimmy okay Warren Buffett"
"7700770","7706150"," apparently telling Jane Fraser the CEO to continue with the overhaul made that case over a lunch"
"7706150","7715790"," meeting according to a bunch timing for weeks right for some reason I think"
"7715790","7721910"," Saint Warren has a bigger voice than mine it's okay it's look it's nice to hear it's not the thesis"
"7721910","7726750"," for being in the stock that Warren Buffett is in it but it certainly helps I agree of course I"
"7726750","7731030"," agree look I think Jane Fraser who's been at this for about three years as a CEO of city group"
"7731030","7736090"," has been doing all the right things first rationalizing the international businesses and by the way"
"7736090","7739910"," on that note second half of this year it looks like they're going to spin out the Banum X operation"
"7739910","7745730"," that's a huge move okay that simplifies the structure of the business then domestically doing"
"7745730","7749930"," things like getting rid of distressed debt and municipal bond businesses those are hard decisions"
"7749930","7755330"," to make all right that's what you want a CEO to do is make hard decisions but ones that benefit"
"7755330","7760190"," the remaining businesses and shareholders this all comes down to cost cuts and making the business"
"7760190","7766450"," simpler to understand both for shareholders and for regulators by the way so Warren agrees okay"
"7766450","7773830"," Jason let's talk some home improvement Oppenheimer today cuts both Home Depot and Lowe's they take"
"7773830","7780550"," it off outperform you got Lowe's okay so they take the price target down to 230 from 275 it seems"
"7780550","7786230"," to be a near term tactic more tactical call they're taking a more cautious stance towards home"
"7786230","7790950"," improvement retail we make this call yeah and I think the call is is pretty much just saying hey"
"7790950","7796770"," listen there might be a better entry point later on down the road I think it's it's possible I"
"7796770","7800430"," don't know I don't know if I necessary agree with that I think part of part of the run listen"
"7800430","7805230"," it's been it's up 15% in the last three months I think part of his policy I really like"
"7805230","7809170"," Marvin Ellison I like what he's done with selling the Canadian business I think I think their"
"7809170","7814090"," operational margins continue to grow and they're focusing on profitability but you know when"
"7814090","7819470"," inventories are really low like they are you know these home improvement stocks can struggle but I"
"7819470","7824290"," still think I still like this one in this space so what about the builders Joe is DR Horton today"
"7824290","7830910"," gets downgraded over its seaport earnings are tomorrow morning for the bell they also reiterate a"
"7830910","7836010"," buy on NVR that's at a 52 week high today I ask you because DR is in the Joty and"
"7836010","7841430"," NVR is in the Joty as well it sure is it a 52 week high and look you can't play"
"7841430","7848430"," both sides of the fence on the show a few weeks back I was talking about the distance between price"
"7848430","7854930"," and the 200 day moving average and how in a lot of the semiconductors names it had gotten extreme"
"7854930","7860410"," towards 25 to 30 percent and that's the case for the home builders okay let's be candid about it"
"7860410","7867050"," when you look at DR Horton you're nearly 30 percent with price above the 200 day moving average so"
"7867050","7871610"," could you have a technical correction absolutely you can what do you do with the information I'm"
"7871610","7875990"," giving you you set the expectation I don't think you do anything with your position because the"
"7875990","7882250"," fundamental conditions that are in place are favorable for the home builders and the setup for 2024"
"7882250","7888570"," if the economy is able to achieve the soft landing if the Federal Reserve begins to cut rates"
"7888570","7895230"," you're going to see a frozen residential real estate market begin to fall out and that's going to"
"7895230","7899850"," fundamentally benefit these companies so be prepared set the expectation you get a technical"
"7899850","7904550"," pullback but fundamentally I'm staying in these names so what about Lulu which got downgraded today"
"7904550","7910650"," the price target 500 the stock had a great run as we've been debating Lulu's place in your"
"7910650","7916790"," portfolio versus a Nike which had been going in opposite directions so what do we do here okay so I"
"7916790","7922430"," read the note rather extensively and they made the valuation argument and what puzzled me about"
"7922430","7931090"," what they were citing is yes they said Adidas offers a bet of valuation but they didn't move on"
"7931090","7937510"," Nike and if you believe you've got this rich valuation in Lulu lemon and you're suggesting that you"
"7937510","7942950"," want to look for valuation opportunities somewhere else well there's Nike which obviously is"
"7942950","7950290"," trading at a significant discount for a reason for reason but not only that but now they don't know"
"7950290","7956030"," what to do with it because the stock had this massive ramp into their earnings which were a massive"
"7956030","7960990"," disappointment so there's where the valuation argument falls and that's where the valuation"
"7960990","7967410"," argument falls because what you have in the case of Lulu is you have strong brand momentum you have"
"7967410","7974070"," strong revenue growth and within the note they're talking about impending impending moderating"
"7974070","7979470"," growth okay impending means may or may not happen I'm not moving out of my position because"
"7979470","7984550"," something's impending just on Nike real quick I mean I got lucky with where I entered it two"
"7984550","7989030"," quarters ago and sold it before this bad quarter that they reported but tell my watch list right"
"7989030","7992930"," this thing looks like it's going to break down below 100 and if it doesn't I think it's going to"
"7992930","7997850"," go test those 52 week lows now I'm saying all that because at some point it does become a buying"
"7997850","8001690"," opportunity I read the articles that they've lost their mojo what are they doing with Tiger Woods"
"8001690","8005930"," all that sort of stuff it's Nike okay it's Nike this gets in the low 90s I think you're supposed"

"8477050","8658390"," transports we will debate the best ways to play that group in just two minutes we"
"8671030","8675710"," are back I want to hit some transports today because and the station we'll go to you first doing"
"8675710","8680350"," this because Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern got upgraded today to outperform over Bernstein"
"8680350","8684750"," what about this group I really like these upgrades I think they're very timely when you look at the"
"8684750","8689390"," Dow Jones Transportation Index it has largely been range bound for the last two years and the"
"8689390","8694590"," reason for that is because after the pandemic we've accumulated these inventories and we then had"
"8694590","8700830"," to destock them and nobody was restocking so you didn't have to have to move more stuff but today"
"8700830","8706450"," we're on the other side of that if I look at inventories we have destock quite significantly and if"
"8706450","8712110"," you look at the manufacturing gauges they're sort of around 50 so that to me suggest that if we're"
"8712110","8717430"," going into this true soft landing economy and demand actually sustains and picks up inflation"
"8717430","8723910"," moderates you know race could also spur a demand pickup you could have this restocking cycle so we"
"8723910","8728370"," are going to have to move stuff again and so when I look at the demand for trucking for rails"
"8728370","8733350"," for example that is collapsed it is now going through a bottoming process and we're starting to get"
"8733350","8738790"," some green shoes from the commentary from shippers and also they expect rates to go up as well so I"
"8738790","8744910"," like picking up the sector here and if you look at the ETF like IYT for example that's rails that's"
"8744910","8749110"," freight that's trucking that's marine transportation so if you think that the world is going to"
"8749110","8754530"," move more stuff that's a very timely call okay Jimmy so if you want to get more stock specific we"
"8754530","8761770"," mentioned UNP in one of the calls today so price target goes to 280 from 229 the firm calls it"
"8761770","8767210"," the best best France rail franchise in the US you own that one yeah I do own it I'm comfortable"
"8767210","8771670"," owning it I take great comfort and agree with what you just said Anastasia the one thing that's"
"8771670","8776510"," interesting is the call that this is the best class one rail franchise in the US I'd like to"
"8776510","8781530"," believe that but I need to see that proven in the results and here's why I'm saying that the stock"
"8781530","8786670"," really languished for about a year and a half until Jim Vana was announced as a CEO last summer and"
"8786670","8792870"," it promptly has risen 20% since then but now treating it 21 times this year's earnings that's just"
"8792870","8798130"," a touch rich unless what Anastasia just said comes through we're shipping goods again and those"
"8798130","8804470"," earnings estimates are nicely beaten again that's a show me sort of story JB Hunt Joey is yours it"
"8804470","8812210"," got upgraded today the trucker to buy it this is at UBS price target to 234 from 205 says the"
"8812210","8818070"," company quote provides strong leverage to a freight cycle turn March 16th 2022 Federal Reserve"

"9997940","10004040"," of avoid it completely I do think that inflation is going to be a little bit stubborn and so you're"
"10004040","10009840"," not going to see the rate cuts as quickly as maybe the street thinks and so when you go back"
"10009840","10015580"," to 2022 and you're looking forward to a lot of rate hikes growth certainly sold off dramatically"
"10016060","10021380"," and then in 2023 when rates came down growth had an unbelievable year I just don't think that I"
"10021380","10026080"," think that rates are going to be you know lower not until the end of the year which is going"
"10026080","10032180"," to cause large cap growth which is quite overvalued by the way versus 20 year averages etc to"
"10032180","10037300"," really stall and then the action is going to be more in the smaller cap cyclical value names that"
"10037300","10044120"," are very undervalued versus their 20 year average did I hear you say that rates came down in 2023"
"10044120","10050020"," that's not my recollection I mean at the end of the year rates backed off a little bit and as"
"10050020","10056260"," there was increasing sentiment that the Fed was going to cut rates but the rates for most of 2023"
"10056260","10060520"," were moving higher but when you look at it out of the 10 year going from 5 percent you know"
"10060520","10065260"," really crossing under 4 percent and they sort of rolled over that way and now on the 10 year you're"
"10065260","10070740"," back up to say a 413 or so so I think that rates are going to be you know maybe"
"10070740","10076300"," under 4 as opposed to really you know taking off from here so kind of kind of an interesting setup"
"10076300","10083140"," so looking at where things were in October where they sit now and the forecast for the rest of the"
"10083140","10091700"," year you see rates coming down right small caps why small caps why value and give us some names"
"10092560","10098540"," yeah I think with a little bit of growth coming and rates doing what they're going to do I just"
"10098540","10103940"," think they're mispriced you know when I look at things like you know atlas energy I think energy is"
"10103940","10109040"," going to do quite well they're in the middle of building a 42 mile conveyor belt system in the"
"10109040","10115500"," Permian Basin and just mining and delivering sand a very simple high cash flow business that's I"

"10121920","10128760"," supplier swimming pool products in the in the world I think had trough earnings in 2023 and will"
"10128760","10135020"," certainly look better in 24 and beyond and I think the consumer is a little bit more resilient and"
"10135020","10139780"," then I look at Palomar technology which is another name that only trades at 15-16 times earnings"
"10139780","10144940"," and growing quickly that's kind of been left for dead by the rest of Wall Street as they chase the"
"10144940","10150240"," Magnificent Seven and so I think that's also an opportunity to be in a name like that that's again"
"10150240","10158860"," just just been unfounded and hopefully people find it you say the trade in growth and especially"
"10158860","10164740"," large cap tech is crowded right now and that you think you'd rather be in small cap or large cap"
"10164740","10171460"," value I wonder does that suggest that that that it's going to be a bad year for for large cap"
"10171460","10176380"," tech and and the Magnificent Seven or just that the smaller caps are going to outperform them?"
"10177160","10180600"," Yeah I think it's going to be more of a stock pickers market and I think a lot of those"
"10180600","10187280"," larger cap Magnificent Seven are just going to stall I think that you could see a little bit of a"
"10187280","10193720"," pullback in the names depending on where where rates go but again I think with inflation being a"
"10193720","10198300"," little bit more stubborn you may not see those cuts as quickly as people think calling large you"
"10198300","10202460"," know making large cap tech sort of stall out and then when people are digging through the rubble"
"10202460","10207720"," and looking for you know other names I think they're going to just cover that small cap is is quite"
"10207720","10212640"," quite reasonably priced and money could be allocated towards towards those sectors Sandy good to"

"11040470","11045150"," seven eight percent of the industry growth and this is an industry that actually grows in mid "
"11045150","11050530","-single digits so AI itself is you know helping drive that you know high-single digit type of growth"

"11065190","11070910"," you think that that that there is an even longer-term play that may not that will give the AI"

"11079390","11083870"," know this is something new that we haven't had this kind of a catalyst in a long time maybe you"

"11089870","11096710"," said right now the most of the benefits of AI are going to NVIDIA as you mentioned we expect that"
"11096710","11101630"," to broaden out over the next few years so we're starting to see companies like Broadcom and AMD"
"11101630","11107870"," this year and then memory for example Micron will be a play on this going forward and even some of"

"11138510","11144650"," NVIDIA and I saw you have a $700 price target on that stock right wow they're just gonna I mean"
"11144650","11149890"," look yeah look valuation-wise it's not that expensive even though the stock has had a massive run"

"11154910","11159150"," times and forward estimates right now it's about 30 times so I think there is some concern that"
"11159150","11164190"," things could slow down a bit we don't see that in the short term along the term there's always that"
"11164190","11168170"," you know risk that you know things could take a pause for a quarter or two we want to be"
"11168170","11172570"," too worried about it because you know it's such a long-term massive trend that if there's a pause"
"11172570","11177850"," in the next one or two you know quarters would actually view that as an opportunity so at 700 we're"

"11197350","11206110"," tepid endorsement or a relatively relatively it's a pretty enthusiastic endorsement yes I think you"
"11206110","11212530"," know we've been positive on Intel since last year stock did quite well last year and you're right"
"11212530","11217910"," it's a it's an out-of-consensus call you know it doesn't get much loud but our view on Intel"
"11217910","11222950"," is that as long as they execute on the roadmap which they seem to be doing the stock continues to"
"11222950","11227970"," work yes you know PC is coming back a bit we do expect the server business to come back a"
"11227970","11233030"," bit this year but at the end of the day what matters for that stock is their technology roadmap and"
"11233030","11237770"," they think they can eventually regain the living in manufacturing from TSM which they used to have"
"11237770","11243370"," two years ago or a few years ago they lost it and if they if they do regain the lead"
"11243370","11247930"," I think that opens up a lot of things for Intel first it does stop the bleeding on their you"
"11247930","11252650"," know share losses in servers and then it opens up the foundry opportunity which is a significant"
"11252650","11257610"," opportunity and then it also opens up the AI opportunity so as long as they're executing you know"
"11257610","11262190"," we'll continue to support their stock let's talk a little bit quick thought if you would on China"
"11262190","11270990"," and how export controls and the chip business in China import controls as well may may be headwinds"
"11270990","11277150"," in this sector yeah I mean you know there are a lot of restrictions already in place and NVIDIA"
"11277150","11282710"," will see some impact but you know the good thing is that the demand in other regions are so so"
"11282710","11288010"," strong the impact is minimal in the short term longer term there will be some impact and also"

"12131320","12138100"," see you man thanks Jeff Kilberg KKM financial coming up the FAA recommending more Boeing planes go"

"12145160","12309480"," couple weeks ago the models impacted and what it means for the carriers that is nice welcome"
"12309480","12315180"," back the FAA recommending expect inspections for more Boeing aircraft Phil Laboe is on the news"
"12315180","12324000"," line with that story Phil this is beyond those 900 max planes well those are 737 max 9 that are"
"12324000","12330340"," grounded this new safety alert is not for a max model this safety alert which was issued last night"
"12330340","12339960"," by the FAA is for 737-900 extended range models and essentially what they're saying is look we want"
"12339960","12346100"," the airlines that have these planes to do visual inspection of the mid exit door plug so they're"
"12346100","12350960"," looking at the door plugs much as that is at the center of the grounding of the max 9s right"
"12350960","12359760"," now but here's an important distinction of these 737-900 ERs these aircraft remain in service they"
"12359760","12365380"," are not grounded so why is this safety alert alert been posted well the FAA says that some of the"
"12365380","12372980"," airlines that have these 737 and by the way these have been flying for a number of years very you"
"12372980","12378360"," know a lot of service would be playing some of the airlines were doing some checks of the door plug"
"12378360","12384780"," once the max 9 issue came up they reported what the FAA report says findings about the door plugs"
"12384780","12389980"," and that was enough for the FAA said look you need to do visual inspection on these there are 504"
"12389980","12396160"," of these that are in service around the world the both of them by the way flown by Delta United"
"12396160","12401360"," and Alaska airline so as you look at shares of Boeing keep in mind that the max 9 has been"
"12401360","12406760"," grounded what basically two weeks now and we still see the pressure that's on the shares right now"
"12406760","12414380"," and these inspections of the 737-900 ER most believe that they will be done relatively quickly"
"12414380","12419060"," again these are visual inspections and the aircraft remain in service don't forget tomorrow morning"
"12419060","12425880"," well after the bell today we get united 2-4 results as well as its guidance for 2024 and we"
"12425880","12431680"," will be talking with CEO Scott Kirby tomorrow morning about that guidance and yes about the max 9"
"12431680","12438500"," because they do have 79 of those max 9 models that are currently grounded the inspection the"
"12438500","12446360"," inspection recommendation does that apply solely to US carriers or does it apply globally it's"
"12446360","12452920"," globally I mean when the FAA they are the the the office of record if you will so even if"
"12452920","12458680"," you are a foreign carrier when the FAA says we recommend that this be done because Boeing is a US"
"12458680","12464960"," corporation right the foreign entities will do it as well yeah very and these are door plugs is"
"12464960","12468480"," that the sort of that rear exit that I'm looking at yeah I don't know what the answer is that"
"12468480","12476480"," that's the mid exit for your larger and remember the 900 ER is a larger 737 it has the capacity"
"12476480","12483720"," to carry more passengers because you have more passengers you have to have some way to allow for an"
"12483720","12489600"," exit if there is an emergency and that's what the mid exit door plug is there for now it's covered"
"12489600","12495840"," up but the whole idea here is on these larger aircraft when you have that capacity you have to"
"12495840","12501000"," allow that to be a possibility is it an emergency exit or not you say it's covered not an emergency"
"12501000","12508440"," it's not an emergency exit per se but it is there because you have that capacity that is that much"

"12779590","12785630"," you for having me no I mean what we're seeing right now it's really two factors that are coming"
"12785630","12791610"," into play the first is that use vehicle values particularly EVs as we you have noted have decreased"
"12791610","12797770"," prematurely on the EV side but also broadly across the board and that's certainly having a pressure"
"12797770","12803870"," on car rental stocks but mostly hurts as you noted the second issue is actually very unique to hurt"
"12803870","12809710"," and that they are staying elevated EV costs from higher damages and repairs related to these EVs"
"12809710","12814790"," and these are higher damages and repair claims versus even you know internal combustion engine"
"12814790","12822090"," vehicles this is creating a lot of just lack of visibility into when when these issues are going to"
"12822090","12828470"," actually subside over time so while you noted we did cut our estimates to about 500 million in"
"12828470","12834630"," eBITDA for 2024 well below the street which is that just over 815 million we don't even have a lot"
"12834630","12841610"," of visibility and and faith in even these cut numbers is hurts going to what they're doing I think"
"12841610","12845630"," if I'm I'm not sure I've got the percentage right it's about a third of their EV fleet is what"
"12845630","12849990"," they're getting rid of is that right or is that right or is that right on that exactly so so"
"12849990","12854310"," they announced they announced about two weeks ago that that they were rebalancing their portfolio"
"12854310","12859670"," and they were going where they will be selling 20,000 of their current 16,000 vehicles which are"
"12859670","12865750"," EVs in the US you know look I do believe that this is the right move just given the cost"
"12865750","12871330"," headwinds that we have seen across EVs but you know look to your point they're only cutting about a"
"12871330","12876650"," third of their current fleet and they'll go so that by the end of 2024 EVs will make up about"
"12876650","12883450"," 8% of their fleet it had about 10% but note that you know a year ago Hertz was"
"12883450","12888850"," targeting that EVs would make up 25% by the end of 2020 they were pushing it they were pushing"
"12888850","12894510"," it hard is you think they're going to get out of it and will other rental companies rental car"
"12894510","12899130"," coming out Hertz owned several brands including Hertz but will they follow suit here to the extent"
"12899130","12904930"," that they're in the EV world and is Hertz going to get completely out of it well so you know"
"12904930","12910230"," Hertz was really at the forefront of EV adoption they start they first started their they're kind"
"12910230","12916450"," of foray into EVs with some partnerships announced back in 2021 and the other EV companies really"
"12916450","12922930"," have not followed suit to the same magnitude of which at Hertz has so I would expect to see that"
"12922930","12927330"," Hertz is going to be the one with the lion's share of the impact of selling EVs and kind of"
"12927330","12933810"," pausing the strategy just given what we're seeing today and what we're seeing it's a couple of"
"12933810","12940150"," factors so you know the original adoption that Hertz expected from EVs has not tanned out the way"
"12940150","12945950"," they expected you just have not seen the penetration the demand from customers all of which is"
"12945950","12950470"," coming into play where you're just not seeing the thing on the adoption that they want and then the"
"12950470","12955510"," other side of it is that you're staying higher repair costs because honestly it's a little bit of a"
"12955510","12960710"," different vehicle to drive well it is a different that's what I want to get as I give background"
"12960710","12964730"," here you have your base case is an eight dollar share stock which is a little bit lower than where"
"12964730","12970730"," it is now best is uh twelve dollars a share and downside is three dollars a share on Hertz that's"
"12970730","12976450"," pretty amazing I wonder why they're having such higher not repair costs I guess I get that but"
"12976450","12981230"," collision costs and so forth is that because people just are not familiar with driving those EVs"
"12981230","12985190"," and so they're distracted by the touch screen or what it is do you have any hunch?"
"12986630","12991230"," Well I don't know if you've ever driven it in Tesla but the first time I got into it I"
"12991230","12996570"," was pretty surprised by how you know how little you had to really put press down on that gas pedal"
"12996570","13001230"," and you really don't touch the brake at all so I think that's the aspect of the the amount of"
"13001230","13005610"," torque when you are driving an EV it's just a little bit different a little bit more sensitive and"
"13005610","13010830"," I think you're just seeing particularly in their rental sleep not in their ride share but in the"
"13010830","13015290"," consumer rental fleet they are seeing higher degree of accidents and then you take this a step"
"13015290","13021170"," further and accidents are one thing but the majority of their EV fleet they are it is Tesla so what"
"13021170","13027210"," you're seeing is that Tesla does not have necessarily the repair you know the repair infrastructure"
"13027210","13034790"," then other OEM so you're also facing higher repair cost dealing with parts as well as actual labor"
"13034790","13039490"," related to both the vehicles themselves very interesting and you are so right I actually do drive a"
"13039490","13044730"," Tesla and they jump they are fast and they get they get moving pretty quick you're not not"
"13044730","13049970"," accustomed to it you'll have a little pullback on it Stephanie thanks good to see you appreciate it"

"13255470","13259990"," get a look at the numbers right now Tyler mentioned that the Dow hit a record high above 38,000"
"13259990","13266150"," a little more than a month after crossing 37,000 for the first time there the S&P 500 also"

"13297530","13303290"," Mike Santoli for more on where the markets stand right now how do you read the tea leaves Mike well"
"13303290","13308230"," Tyler the first thing probably to note is that a new record high in the S&P 500 especially after"
"13308230","13313290"," a long drought and this one has been over two years is generally more a show of strength that"
"13313290","13317950"," should continue as opposed to a warning sign that a top is likely in if you look at the prior"
"13317950","13322830"," dozen or so let's say 14 times where the S&P has made a new record high after a year"
"13322830","13327870"," without one the forward returns are actually better than average up 90 percent of the time over 12"
"13327870","13332390"," months obviously that's no guarantee clearly there've been exceptions and I do think one of the"
"13332390","13336610"," quibbles that people are going to point to is the unevenness of the gains especially in the last"
"13336610","13341070"," few weeks where you do have a small handful of the mega cap tech stocks carrying the weight that"
"13341070","13346470"," said I think we could take some comfort in the fact that it's also occurred as economic data have"
"13346470","13352890"," been better than expected and the odds of a March Fed rate cut have declined which suggests that"
"13352890","13359090"," good news for the economy is somewhat good news for the S&P 500 index and by implication for most"
"13359090","13363850"," of the stocks and for the earnings outlook so I would say a net positive sign even though we maybe"
"13363850","13368810"," have not quite had enough payback from that fourth quarter rally in the average stock just yet all"
"13368810","13374050"," right thank you Mike stick around as we want to keep the conversation going our next guest thinks"
"13374050","13378210"," the market is due for a pause let's bring in Brent shooty a chief investment officer with"
"13378210","13382610"," Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Brent welcome good to have you with us you heard Mike there"
"13382610","13389050"," talk about what history tells us and history tells us that when the S&P says Mike hits a new"
"13389050","13395930"," high after not having hit one for a year or more that the performance is usually pretty good are is"
"13395930","13400530"," what you're saying does it quarrel with that thesis or does it just mean we're going to have a"
"13400530","13405990"," pause and then we'll pick up and move farther higher unfortunately I think it corals with that"
"13405990","13410070"," thesis I think this time is a bit different given kind of what's happened post-COVID and where"
"13410070","13414670"," we're at right now look to me I think a lot of the good news is been priced in people"
"13414670","13420570"," see finally inflation coming down that was something we forecasted now we're worried that inflation"
"13420570","13424850"," is moving from a covid thing which is what that was to something of an end-of-a-business cycle"
"13424850","13430090"," thing so we're relinking to an economy that looks late in an economic cycle where wages rise they"
"13430090","13434410"," stay elevated and that puts upward pressure on inflation which is where we think right right now"
"13434410","13439710"," and given that backdrop we don't think the Fed is going to be using policy anytime soon certainly"
"13439710","13443590"," if they do I think they really risk a wage price spiral and we think inflation numbers have"
"13443590","13448070"," bottomed out but they are certainly showing signs of pushing back higher so for example the"
"13448070","13454070"," Cleveland Fed median CPI is rising core inflation it's kind of stalled out in the 3 percent area as"
"13454070","13459490"," has services X shelter which is in the 5 percent area and so we think you know these things are"
"13459490","13464090"," going to cause inflation worries to come back the federal reserve is going to stay tighter and the"
"13464090","13467170"," market will actually experience some sort of a pullback in the coming months."
"13467170","13474150"," I see in my notes that you say we continue to forecast a recession you're fighting the good fight"
"13474150","13480490"," there a lot of people have given up that forecast you have not I wonder why number one you see"
"13480490","13485630"," that as a probability but number two if there's going to be a recession why wouldn't you then"
"13485630","13491270"," believe that the Fed would be more inclined to cut interest rates to make sure that the economy"
"13491270","13492370"," doesn't slump deeply."
"13493670","13497050"," I am more inclined to believe that the Federal Reserve will cut rates when they see a recession but"
"13497050","13501530"," by that I'd imagine the stock market would falter if history is any guide and so to me that's kind"
"13501530","13505570"," of a sequencing I think you will see the Fed eventually cut rates once they see the labor market"
"13505570","13511350"," weaken but that tends to be a trending type of an index and typically when the Fed cuts rates it"
"13511350","13515350"," doesn't arrest the stock market decline immediately nor does it arrest the recession immediately"
"13515350","13519850"," and that typically has a period of negative returns which I think is more likely than not. "
"13520290","13524230"," Look last year we were fighting the good fight of inflation coming down and no one believed us"
"13524230","13529510"," that's happened this year I feel just as lonely as I did last year I still think a recession is"
"13529510","13534610"," likely just given that I don't believe the Fed is going to ease policy until you see that labor"
"13534610","13536690"," market weaken which by then it's too late."
"13536830","13542890"," Well listen Brent the voice crying in the wilderness is often correct it's just unheard."
"13543510","13547970"," Let me bring Mike back in here Mike we're looking for some data later this week the fourth quarter"
"13547970","13553510"," GDP numbers we're looking for the personal consumption expenditures price index how much could"
"13553510","13555530"," those numbers move the market?"
"13555990","13561070"," I think that's a pretty significantly I mean I think a premise for this market remaining on firm"
"13561070","13566690"," footing is that this inflation story has to remain believed and plausible and it has to show up in"

"14356470","14361810"," think one of the biggest remains a pull forward in demand in the pandemic so we're sort of safe"

"14366170","14371570"," lower but they're higher they're higher at this point so all that's contributing to what i think is"

"17033770","17038430"," see what she's basing that upon any of you up there I have a question for you guys but here"
"17038430","17047810"," in this person speak on CNBC right now can you give me a a historical example there are some uh"
"17047810","17057650"," yeah but I know the reasons why in those historical examples they were positive for US stocks so if"
"17057650","17065370"," you know why the first rate cuts would be positive for stocks what would be the reason for that"
"17065370","17075230"," because about 80% of the time in that first rate cuts the market actually crashes so there are some"
"17075230","17079130"," instances where they do where the market does not but I want to know from you if you know the"
"17079130","17088910"," reasoning behind that so if you can answer that I'd appreciate it not only that I always"
"17088910","17095170"," wonder when these people are on my guess my other question here is these other people that are on"
"17095170","17102250"," CNBC is part of their own bonds so are they pushing something a narrative that doesn't really match"
"17102250","17124840"," up with where their investments lie um"
"17124840","17131660"," a lot a lot of large cap COs are actually downgrading guidance outside of technology it's really in"
"17131660","17136440"," technology we're hearing upgrades in terms of of the earnings outlet don't you think that if you"
"17136440","17141580"," know if there are these cuts and let's just say it's three for for argument sake and but rates"
"17141580","17147620"," continue to to come down or at the very least stop going up you know is that's going to continue"
"17147620","17151500"," to be good for growth stocks because that again is you know people like David Cost and keep talking"
"17151500","17156840"," about that that just lower rates are going to fuel the growth trade we've seen this every time"
"17156840","17162420"," we've had lower rates if fuels are growth trade um and and you have okay so this woman here is"
"17162420","17168880"," talking about so this woman here is pushing a narrative that's false uh we're gonna interject here"
"17168880","17176600"," for a moment uh on the stream really quick because she's really driving me fucking nuts and uh"
"17176600","17186440"," we're gonna take a quick look and see we can see here give me a quick second here she's out"
"17186440","17193480"," of her fucking mind or she's lying to you 1000 percent uh we're gonna talk about that right now"
"17193480","17198840"," this woman that this one's on CNBC right now she's pushing a narrative that is fucking false and"
"17198840","17203280"," it's really driving me fucking baddie here in the background and I got a second here to chat so uh"
"17203280","17211400"," we'll bring this up here me quick second here so this person here and the on CNBC is pushing a"
"17211400","17217740"," narrative that it can be very false now it doesn't mean every time it's false we're gonna chat"
"17217740","17227700"," about that right now and uh what she's stating to us on CNBC this is where my this is a"
"17227700","17235500"," um all the macro you need kind of a chart uh basically if you're a cash market participant what you"
"17235500","17240860"," need to know about when we get crashes in the marketplace and I'm gonna remove this right now here"
"17240860","17246260"," for you just put to the side here and put this to the side here this is the unemployment rate"
"17246260","17248640"," you want to see typically traditionally you want"
"17248640","17258520"," to see the you also want to see uh"
"17258520","17268500"," the unemployment rate uh hit two percent and then ricochet off"
"17269020","17275580"," so this one could be improved right here let me a quick second here I'm gonna improve this this"
"17275580","17284840"," line is not accurate here hold on a second here right there so you should see unemployment slam"
"17284840","17293780"," down into two percent and then bounce off and ricochet we'll make that purple here for you and"
"17293780","17298200"," we'll make the line solid and maybe like a number two or something like that so you can see it"
"17298200","17304320"," better maybe a number three uh there are some instances where we what now this is inflation down"
"17304320","17309620"," here right you want to see inflation uh and you also want to see the velocity of inflation uh you"
"17309620","17316980"," don't want to see inflation go down like this per se and touch two percent uh or if you're a"
"17316980","17323340"," bear uh but you do want uh like the slam down the velocity in the downside tag of two percent"
"17323340","17330320"," and then a ricochet to the upside something more like this right velocity and inflation so what i'm"
"17330320","17337840"," showing you right there now this person here is saying that uh whenever we see rate cuts uh they"
"17337840","17345360"," tend to bode well for the stock market um that hasn't historically been the case you can see here"
"17345360","17351240"," uh you can actually see right here there's a there's a quick rip up right this is a violence in"
"17351240","17358700"," an upside move but it results in a major downside move in the marketplace when you get these cuts"
"17358700","17365440"," okay so there's the anticipation of rate cuts there's the fuel in that in that and there's actually"
"17365440","17371760"," a larger role so you'll sometimes hear me on stream say things like uh if we're if they're"
"17371760","17377420"," anticipating a role in march you'll see a cocaine fueled rally but then that cocaine fueled rally"
"17377420","17386400"," does result in a crash stock market crash so my point or my thesis here is that um you know"
"17386400","17390840"," if you're anticipating rate cuts you like fuck yeah we're getting rate cuts and we begin to go"
"17390840","17397920"," higher uh you should be in jubilation right and the reality is you're just looking for liquidity to"
"17397920","17406860"," drop the market down so now you could have um short term or mid-term um some bullishness here but"
"17406860","17414260"," the idea here is that it rolls and we sometimes don't even get this uh portion it just rolls uh"
"17414260","17419440"," to the downside depending on where we are historical examples at least uh so let's look at that and"
"17419440","17426180"," some prior examples of this in history and i can show you more examples of this this is another"
"17426180","17433140"," rates cut right here you know this person's on cmbc pushing you a narrative and there is a pause in"
"17433140","17439060"," rates and there is the cut in rates and you can see what that results in here boom downside move"
"17439060","17444900"," erase everything that you thought was awesome sauce here's another example right here right you get"
"17444900","17450900"," the pause in rates whoop it doesn't matter fact you had a cut here right and he had a cut"
"17450900","17455800"," right here that did result in some more climbing higher but eventually pulled back but the real"
"17455800","17462380"," cuts the real rate cuts here resulted in a downside move so you get the point that i'm trying to"
"17462380","17472180"," make here right and we have example though when it has not happened"
"17472180","17478160"," there are some examples of when when that did not happen you can actually see a rate cut here with"
"17478160","17483040"," a bit more stiffness pullback but not the damage that you're expecting this is back in the 1990s"
"17483040","17490160"," but there are other um there are other my point here is that there are other um uh factors involved"
"17490160","17495840"," you can see one right here too nice pullback right here just grinding sideways grinding sideways"
"17495840","17501560"," pullback right here in the first cut and then continue downside moves now this isn't 100% of the"
"17501560","17506980"," time that this happens but it is it is enough that if you were to trade it you would trade"
"17506980","17511840"," this with you can go back all the way back to the 1950s on this stuff but if you were"
"17511840","17518960"," to go back and look at all instances of rate cuts they tend to either they would lead to one"
"17518960","17526900"," of two things either either looking for liquidity to the upside or you're to drop the market or we"
"17526900","17533380"," just roll down unless there's some other reason for us to go higher typically that has to do with"
"17533380","17541360"," some form of QE from the treasury department there's some issuance stuff with bonds we were talking"
"17541360","17548960"," about earlier last week you need to see that stuff for a positive outcome in rate cuts so i always"
"17548960","17553480"," question what these people are talking about when they say things like yeah rate cuts are good for"
"17553480","17558820"," equities i'm like yeah for how long one week two weeks do they just roll a straight down right"
"17558820","17564660"," there or instead of looking for logging the market uh for a month or two i'm actually looking for"
"17564660","17569800"," liquidity to sell the market to the downside we got some news coming out at the end of the month"
"17569800","17577600"," that i don't think will benefit or favor bulls but there are people out there currently watching to"
"17577600","17583740"," see um what that data is coming out from the treasury department i believe in the 31st or 29th or"
"17583740","17589140"," something like that but even watching this action in the market this right rise that we see in this"
"17589140","17594960"," market right now it was in my view some sort of anticipation of rate cuts and then a major market"
"17594960","17601220"," downside move so you're like yeah super bullish here cap we're going to 4900 we're going to 5000 or"
"17601220","17606640"," something then we get hit with a rate cut in March or May if that were to happen uh i"
"17606640","17610980"," would be looking for more of an exit liquidity right instead of going to 5,200 or 6,000 or"
"17610980","17616460"," something like that looking for an actual role in the market down possibly even into that trough"
"17616460","17622760"," that we had back in 2022 uh so are you watching did you did you just miss when i went"
"17622760","17626200"," back in every single rate cut you're going to show you all the way back to the 1950s we can"
"17626200","17631140"," do that right now uh hold on a second here there there none of them are different they're all the"
"17631140","17636760"," same we'll look at them again we'll show you one more time so we can be fucking super crystal clear"
"17636760","17642680"," in this stupid shit so that none of you are pushing bent false narratives out there on twitter okay"
"17642680","17652510"," i'll show you them all going back to the 1950s right here now you someone just"
"17652510","17657670"," made a comment lol that was covid we have this one right here explain this one to me this is"
"17657670","17663590"," back in 2007 explain this one to me this is back in 2000 i'm going to go to spx really"
"17663590","17667670"," quick and show you a better i'll show you only back to the 50s and you start explaining that to"
"17667670","17674630"," me because i think a lot of you out there have preconceived notions on this stuff here but you can"
"17674630","17681090"," you can get this stuff for yourself get on uh get on trading view and uh pull down the fed"
"17681090","17691010"," funds rate on its own scale the unemployment rates and the"
"17691010","17699390"," but the yield curve but that's not as accurate it it it historically leaves um it's only accurate"
"17699390","17705550"," about 60 percent of the time uh explain this one back in 2000 to me please if you can explain"
"17705550","17712070"," this one right here uh hold on a second here explain let me show you a bunch of these explain"
"17712070","17717170"," this post pull back right here explain this one right here for me uh we can go on and on"
"17717170","17723750"," and on and on again on these rate cuts here this one wasn't so bad but there was a pull"
"17723750","17729390"," back we actually had a larger pull back uh uh further on here's another one back in the 1950s right"
"17729390","17736130"," here here's another one right here uh we actually had a rate rate cut right here and then just that"
"17736130","17741910"," pull back right there on cuts so you can see those right there but you can actually see when this"
"17741910","17749050"," stuff ends up happening uh go back all all historical examples of rate cuts we only have a few that"
"17749050","17753810"," caught I think it's only like two maybe two or three where uh when we touch that two percent"
"17753810","17761230"," inflation and we have unemployment's ramping that we did not get rolled to the downside and as a"
"17761230","17768750"," matter of fact if you look right here right now you can actually see the ramp kind of taking place"
"17768750","17773970"," here this is the fraud moment in the market so this is unemployment right this is where I this is"
"17773970","17779230"," where my thesis is the longer they keep unemployment's kind of around here doing this nonsense and"
"17779230","17784430"," not getting that full ramp right there this is where the manipulation phase comes into the"
"17784430","17789130"," marketplace same on inflation the more this inflation number kind of bounces in here and doesn't"
"17789130","17795390"," hit two percent uh the fed is the fed in the treasury department is prolonging that expected role"
"17795390","17802590"," and as a matter of fact just by looking at this period right here just that looking at this period"
"17802590","17809490"," right about here this is going back to uh june of 2023 right in here uh this is where the"
"17809490","17814650"," fraud starts the longer they can make this market go sideways with these uh this date these data"
"17814650","17821610"," points the longer they keep this these rates held sideways the more the more the the chances are or"
"17821610","17828630"," the probability are of this market to continue uh to the side sideways and to the upside it's the"
"17828630","17834830"," moment they begin to actually cut rates that I would be fearful as a bull uh so I I don't"
"17834830","17840250"," know I'm I guess I'm looking for you they have someone's out there commenting uh what do you got"
"17840250","17844130"," there they have a fixed right matrix right on appreciate that traded podcast so I'd really like to"
"17844130","17850610"," know from you if something better than oh yeah that was that doesn't really fly uh some examples"
"17850610","17859410"," for when we actually do not roll to the downside now there is a positive out there I did read"
"17859410","17866450"," finally someone did finally post a story somewhere that the prime banks are lending to hedge funds"
"17866450","17872590"," to invest in the stock market I did post that on the chat last week I believe on Friday uh"
"17872590","17877470"," and then I posted something to I think a gamut or whatever his name is he was talking about that"
"17877470","17882570"," same stuff you want to be seeing the treasury department and the federal reserve doing some kind of"
"17882570","17888050"," uh more money right money supply needs to increase basically in the market for that expansion that"
"17888050","17893310"," you're looking for and you'd want the public to know about it that's another key part you want the"
"17893310","17904690"," public to be to know about this before you rate you cut rates I think"
"17904690","17909890"," that's a 300 percent yeah I'll put her back on a topic lab again I apologize to my client right"

"18408170","18412910"," last couple days you've begun to see some renewed leadership from the Smalls today in particular"
"18412910","18418310"," and you know look at this group right small caps it's banks banks drive it and I think the way"
"18418310","18422610"," the banks have responded not just the last couple days again starting to work but really the entire"
"18422610","18427010"," fourth quarter is suggestive of some small cap leadership that's funny you say that because I mean"

"18449630","18453370"," they behaving as if they're the weakest part of the market and I think you could say pretty"
"18453370","18459450"," comfortably right now neither the regional banks or the REITs are behaving as if they are still the"

"18497570","18503130"," health care strength is not extending to the other defensive groups so this is just not some move"
"18503130","18507510"," into defensive health care defensive nature staples this is health care working on its own right"
"18507510","18511610"," which is a change in terms of what the leadership fabric of this market spin you want to tell me"
"18511610","18518530"," what the not just technical aspect of this move in semis means but you know this the macro reasons"
"18518530","18524610"," or what justifies this move and maybe there's plenty I'm not I'm not trying to throw stones at it"
"18524610","18531610"," it's just continues to blow the mind I think what's important we know the story in the video we"
"18531610","18536470"," know the story of AMD it's getting broader than that I mean the breakout in Taiwan semi in the last"
"18536470","18541490"," 48 hours is meaningful from look their guide last week is one of the reasons why tech sort of got"
"18541490","18546530"," restarted importantly equal weight technology so you know moving away from just in video or"

"18563870","18567950"," something one must be mindful of in the first quarter first half of the year but it's hard to"
"18567950","18572970"," position against it until you begin to see the relative leadership deteriorate which has not"
"18572970","18576590"," happened yet I mean this is the power of momentum exactly what you're talking about I mean we're"
"18576590","18581590"," talking about today one of the highest readings in technology sector 52 week highs in many many"
"18581590","18586630"," years that tends not to be bearish you can consolidate from it you can pause from it but that's"
"18586630","18591650"," more of a signature of a bull market not a bear market the internals from tech still reflect that"
"18591650","18595430"," far let you go I mean is there one thing that you look at and you say well this concerns"
"18595430","18599870"," me yeah I think it's always important to be like what are the blemishes there or what could disrupt"
"18599870","18606230"," this watch crude here crude over 77 78 would be a changing character and I would continue to"

"18981290","18986090"," simple is the stock market gonna do well this year what's your answer I think the the the runway is"
"18986090","18990570"," improved if you continue to see what you and I've talked about a lot which is this rolling weakness"
"18990570","18994750"," under the surface of the economy transform and sort of transferred to different sectors at"
"18994750","18998470"," different times because you look at certain sectors like manufacturing particularly in the"
"18998470","19002590"," sentiment world where a lot of that data still looks weak still looks recessionary if you're going"
"19002590","19006950"," to take something like the empire survey last week which got a lot of attention doesn't pretend a"
"19006950","19011410"," very strong reading for ISM manufacturing and at the same time you're starting to see more cracks"
"19011410","19015950"," underneath the surface of the labor market but if that doesn't morph into this widespread weakness"
"19015950","19020370"," at the services level or at the at the overall labor level then you don't go into a full-blown"
"19020370","19025050"," recession and you sort of continue to roll on with the unique nature of the cycle all of that being"
"19025050","19029210"," said that probably paints a better scenario for for equities and I think it's it's a much better"
"19029210","19033950"," way to think about it where you kind of normalize you go into an environment where you no longer"
"19033950","19038550"," have these huge divergences between you know large caps versus small caps are the mag seven versus"
"19038550","19042830"," the rest of the market that was very much the story last year as we all know but you know"
"19042830","19047770"," a character of a market that was November December where you did really start to see it broadening"
"19047770","19051050"," out that that's something that we would look for this year may not may not be as great at the"
"19051050","19055650"," headline level but under the surface it would be a lot better a lot more than just run for the"
"19055650","19060250"," you know run for the money heading to the end of the year I mean I think there was definitely"
"19060250","19064590"," a lot of you know pressure that had built up and and sort of pushed money and that was itching"
"19064590","19068190"," to look for you know other parts of the market that hadn't done well but at the same time you"
"19068190","19072950"," know the breadth picture for even something like small caps has improved dramatically just look at"
"19072950","19077030"," the percentage of companies within even the Russell that are above their 200-day moving average"
"19077030","19081150"," you've made a series of higher highs and higher lows than that index so even though you've been in"
"19081150","19087690"," this chop phase since 2022 where you know you've gone up 20 percent down 18 percent up 15 down 10"
"19088250","19093010"," for a considerable period of time throughout that entire period it isn't that breadth this weekend"
"19093010","19097130"," it's actually started to strengthen so then I'm not suggesting you you should be anything in your"
"19097130","19100890"," view of the market but why aren't you more bullish if you're if you're here pointing out this"
"19100890","19105630"," broadening that you think is believable especially under the surface in something like small caps"
"19105630","19109650"," because you know money's gone back into the mega caps so if you're leaving the mega caps and now"
"19109650","19112770"," you believe in the small caps aren't you painting a more bullish scenario?"
"19112850","19116490"," Yeah I mean it's not a binary trade I think one of the things and I talked about this last"
"19116490","19119710"," time I was on with Mike I thought you know one of the things I think we get caught up"
"19119710","19123050"," in a lot is is it going to be you know one group that has to do well at the"
"19123050","19126670"," expense of the other I don't think that's the case I think that both can do well and that's why"
"19126670","19131490"," I talk about this more normalized environment where you can get to a scenario where if the economy"
"19131490","19136550"," stops sending these sort of late cycle you know signals whether it's from the leading indicators or"
"19136550","19141330"," whether it's from the manufacturing and the housing side which thankfully some housing data looked"
"19141330","19145710"," to be turning and maybe not entering their own expansion but at least forming up a little bit that"
"19145710","19149950"," ends up being a better scenario for the overall market itself but you know headlined index gains"
"19149950","19154690"," that you saw last year because of a couple of names that happened to you know constitute a large"
"19154690","19158910"," portion of the index maybe that's not the case moving forward but I much rather look for something"
"19158910","19163370"," that's a lot healthier where you have participation under the surface improving at a much faster"
"19163370","19165950"," degree sorry how many rate cuts we get in this year and when do they start?"
"19166250","19171010"," I don't know modeling it in how can you know I mean about how many we might get I think"
"19171010","19176010"," the discussion around rate cuts if you're thinking about it as to when or how many that to me is"
"19176010","19179870"," sort of missing the broader picture of why are they happening so to me it's tell me the economic"
"19179870","19183970"," data when we're at the first rate cut and I'll tell you if it's a good cut or a bad"
"19183970","19188050"," cut and I'll tell you probably if you're going to get more or less I think if that is placing"
"19188050","19192370"," your bets now though that they're going to be good cuts so to speak because you're yeah this guy's"
"19192370","19196330"," doing a good job right now of explaining that there are good cuts and bad cuts right now you want"
"19196330","19201150"," to listen closely to this guy your word rates bad cuts would be they have to cut because the"
"19201150","19205570"," economy softened too much absolutely I think that yeah in the scenario where they're easing a"
"19205570","19209410"," little bit but you still have a lot more pressure from real rates because they stay elevated I mean"
"19209410","19213130"," think in the in the instance of inflation continuing to come down let's say it you know you you"
"19213130","19217710"," continue to ease at a trend that you've been seeing over the past couple of months maybe even over"
"19217710","19222630"," the past year and the Fed only cuts three or four times that still keeps real rates in pretty"
"19222630","19226950"," restrictive territory I don't think that's a bad scenario if they think and the and the economic"
"19226950","19231670"," data prove that the economy can handle that situation but at the same time yes if you have to pivot"
"19231670","19235390"," to more aggressive rate cuts then they see something that's a little bit sinister under the surface"
"19235390","19239870"," and then that probably means a little bit of a weaker scenario for risk assets but I think that the"
"19239870","19245370"," unique nature again of the cycle is that you can't really pick out any certain analog from history"
"19245370","19249690"," and say well if the Fed is cutting at this point yeah I like that usual whales a lot too"
"19249690","19255070"," you're seeing your whole investment analysis off of just the Fed I think is you know is a pretty"
"19255070","19259290"," useless exercise when you're not taking into account the economic data itself really I mean because"
"19259290","19265010"," someone suggested actually is that simple just don't fight the Fed I mean no because I mean look at"
