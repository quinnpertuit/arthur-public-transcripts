"zQuDa_e8OD8","80720","85080"," waving it around down the bottom here this is SPX your gamma flip is right here"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","85080","92640"," hey it's January 31st"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","97920","110200"," it's a 478 and then 470 right there so I'll put spread right now dated for January"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","110200","119880"," 31st 478 470 that's a long put at 478 short put at 470 cost is $225 pays out"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","119880","144800"," $575 just doing like a 480 to 470 put spread and then if it does go if we do"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","144880","150720"," blood down to 460 or 450 day trade that stuff so"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","154880","163400"," all right place this tree right now man I'm long good it's an American divide it"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","163400","166760"," kind of puts you know I'll chase it up I mean the one thing I'll say is this is"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","166760","176600"," not really a fan here of a large downside move I was talking yesterday to who"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","176600","179280"," yesterday I was talking to chase yesterday and he was said where do you"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","179280","182360"," think it comes down to hey good morning game how are you he's like you're"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","182360","187960"," expecting a big downside move and I was said to him at worst 450 460 possibly"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","187960","194480"," but just doing like a 480 to 470 put spread and then if it does go if we do"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","194480","202920"," blood down to 460 or 450 day trade that stuff so between now and the 31st I"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","202920","207480"," think I'll I'll be able to capture this trade at some points now if we trade up"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","207480","212560"," from here we break above 4800 and we trade 4900 I'll just day trade that all"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","212560","218000"," the way up as well and I could also cut the the sold puts on one side of the"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","218000","223160"," trade and then hang on to the bot puts heading into the end of the month so"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","223240","234400"," oh yeah it's already printing right now they're already up I think seven bucks"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","234400","237080"," or something like that"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","244600","250760"," I posted the trade on finchwett so you're you're basically buying a 478 P"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","250760","257000"," you're selling a 470 P the idea here would be if we go higher you monetize"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","257000","266520"," the 470 P right and then the you keep the four 78 on and whatever yeah I think the"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","266520","269720"," spread is the way to go I'll be honest I think that the spread is the best way"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","269720","275120"," right now to trade this so not necessarily bearish here I want to say to"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","275120","278440"," have more or less I'm looking for that ping-pong trade I think H bomb said it"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","278440","282880"," earlier it's like that 480 to 470 trade if I can at any point monetize 470 or if"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","282880","285720"," you get some capitulation the other one thing about the spread is I don't make"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","285720","291440"," any extra money below that 470 so when we tag it if we tag or trade 475 74 right"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","291440","296480"," now so I just want to wait but I need another 55 points on on SPX buy to get"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","296480","302960"," that a full print so we'll just leave on until we get that 470 JPM call you want"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","302960","309360"," to take a look at it let's take a look at it right now JPM caller crude oil super"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","309360","315640"," tank it for you you turn before entering the recipe this is spy got to go to"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","315640","325160"," SPX that's what I'm looking for I'm looking for something like this I'm"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","325160","329400"," looking for something like this ready something like this into the 17 actually"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","329400","334240"," 26 or 29 and then I'm looking for something like that right there probably"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","334240","337920"," not this but you know something like that I think it's a failure to be honest I"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","337920","342760"," think it's something more like this so let's do it like that I'm looking for"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","342760","348440"," this grind down into the 17th for me it's not the 17th it's 26th or the 29th then"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","348440","353760"," a grind up and I think we fail this I don't think we actually tag it you get"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","353760","356840"," the all-time highs and XP SPX and then we have some kind of a bloodbath here"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","356840","362720"," into mid March now this is where I think we go in a mid March that's my"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","362720","369980"," most probable outcome here is worth likely worst case scenario right and then"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","369980","373840"," we like swing back up here into the end of the quarter there are some out there"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","373840","376760"," that think we go all the way down into coast to coast I don't know this is your"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","376760","383360"," least probable it's like 5% possibly 15% chance so I'm not putting any"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","383360","386720"," validation into this trade I'm not going to validate that for myself at"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","386720","391640"," least I think if you got your I think if you got your rate cuts in your March"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","391640","395560"," meeting it's on the table we'll talk about that too someone just posted about"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","395560","400200"," rate cuts are back on the table again I think this is valid to more valid on a"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","400200","405800"," rate cut that we tagged this low down here but with no rate cuts in March your"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","405800","411760"," best bet or my best my best my worst case scenario is about 4200 my most"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","411800","417080"," probable scenario for a for a seasonal low is right here let's talk about this"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","417080","423920"," right here because switch over real quick and look at that okay so this is"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","423920","427640"," really what I'm looking for here right buying this down here you see that like"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","427640","431600"," just right down there now if there's like a quick capitulation down and I can"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","431600","435180"," actually grab that one that'd be fucking phenomenal I would like I'll be"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","435180","440040"," honest with you I'm a cheap ass bull okay so if I can get that by down here"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","440080","442920"," be stoked I'd even be stoked with that I don't think they give me that though"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","442920","446200"," you need some you need something to happen for this to happen in my view"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","446200","449760"," like I cutting rates as a matter of fact if they cut rates I would not buy this"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","449760","453960"," so if an off chance we go down there like a five percent chance we go down"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","453960","457540"," there without rate cuts sure I'll buy it but the truth is that I'm looking for"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","457540","462280"," something more like this 4200 right here something like that okay"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","462280","466800"," somewhere I catch that take the other trip higher there's an alternate"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","466800","473160"," scenario in this JPM caller and we need to talk about that as well there is an"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","473160","480000"," alternate scenario here and that alternate scenario is kind of crazy"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","480000","489120"," you know let's talk about that alternate scenario here so there's an alternate"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","489120","491640"," scenario out there right now right a gully it was out there"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","491640","495000"," global economy is poised for a soft landing with lower inflation but low"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","495000","500280"," income countries are at risk of falling further behind there's an alternate"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","500280","505560"," bull scenario now Miguel it was talking about it earlier in the week right he"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","505560","514880"," was talking about where the Fed announces an end to QT they begin QE and"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","514880","521040"," they can add in some some rate cuts the market would scream higher or they leave"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","521040","525240"," rates where they are announce QT or to end the QT"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","525240","531240"," deliver rates where they are they announce an end of QT they could create"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","531240","536160"," this like it's like a sentiment thing like let me go but maybe we should go back"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","536160","547680"," to that one there's an alternate thesis here now you all know my take on this"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","547680","555200"," right that back there for you or whatever there's an alternate take on"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","555200","563160"," this so this without showing you guys the other charts or whatever that I have"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","563160","567640"," turned it out for the year if you get no rate cuts my expectation areas like"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","567640","571760"," something like this here right and you're gonna make this move higher you come"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","571760","575480"," into September you're gonna catch some weakness maybe even a bloodbath down"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","575480","578120"," here a major correction doesn't matter but then you get it doesn't matter"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","578120","582720"," because you're gonna get out a hall or an election run the ball will come off"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","582720","588120"," for the election and this thing usually lasts in to March of 2025 so you're one"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","588120","591320"," dip by down here you get your other dip by down here there's another June dip"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","591320","595400"," by somewhere in here but basically you're buying this stuff to ultimately lie"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","595400","599760"," here now there's it Miguel it's but basically saying this this is a chopped"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","599760","602920"," up version of what he's saying but basically what he's saying is if we have"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","602920","612840"," public public end of QT and public QE if you can change the if you can if this"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","612840","620360"," is a weird thing right if everyone knows that we're in this this a Goldilocks"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","620360","625660"," zone right rather than having this play out you would have like a FOMO"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","625660","630720"," exuberance where like this would be bought and we would have like a crazy"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","630720","636520"," like like straight-up move and there's a reason for this there's a reason for"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","636520","639360"," that Miguel thing and that the reason is this it's this it's very it's very"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","639360","644920"," similar to the tech bubble in 2000 if everyone knows that we're coming in and"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","644920","648200"," we're gonna talk about that today if we can too there's a housing cycle that"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","648200","653040"," last nine years and there's a housing cycle that last 18 years so if everybody"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","653040","657480"," knows there's gonna be a party into that by the way that housing"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","657480","660680"," department is lifting up to three million pounds of over here strategic"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","660680","666880"," security and it says that housing top should come in 2026 so if you line"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","666880","674080"," everything up right you line everything up where sentiment is the key here where"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","674080","678680"," everyone knows the Fed is doing something for the election everyone knows that"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","678680","682160"," we're at the end of a big housing cycle when you start figuring it all out you're"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","682160","685080"," like oh that's right we were at the end of a housing cycle we already had I'll"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","685080","689080"," show you that too here if you want to see it hold on here well anyways I'll"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","689080","691320"," show it here in a minute but there's we've already had the pullback in that"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","691320","695680"," 18 year cycle and then normally in that end of that 18 or 16 or 16 year cycle"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","695680","700560"," no 18 year cycle excuse me at the end of that 18 year cycle you have a it's like"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","700560","704960"," this it's like 18 years right and right at the end of the housing cycle we get a"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","704960","710280"," dip and then we get this like scream in housing prices and this is very similar"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","710280","713520"," to the tech bubble and we already have this part right here this has already"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","713520","718080"," happened this part so if everyone gets on board that we're at the end of this"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","718080","723840"," cycle you can see this this over exuberance to the upside now that's not"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","723840","729720"," guaranteed to happen here but it's possible it's very possible it's very"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","729720","733020"," possible and so if that were to happen I'm gonna post on Twitter about it too"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","733020","736640"," saying a lot of bulls would be left on the sidelines believe it or not they'd be"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","736640","739240"," like I want to pull back I want to pull back and they just watch it just fucking"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","739240","746560"," melt up into 2020 five six to some like a crazy exuberance I don't know I know"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","746560","749960"," some of you know this but some of you probably don't when we're in that tech"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","749960","753760"," bubble at the end they were having days like one day wake up and we would be up"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","753760","761080"," like three four five six seven percent in a day like straight up so if you get"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","761080","765200"," enough people on that trade it's a possibility but it's still a slim"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","765280","770520"," possibility it's like the bare thesis we're gonna get rate cuts right now that"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","770520","773720"," we're not gonna end QT we're gonna get rate cuts they're not gonna introduce QE"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","773720","778600"," until the bloodbath happens all that shit so it's a it's an outlier but it's"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","778600","782520"," possible as a point it is it is possible I'll give it to the bulls that they do"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","782520","787120"," have a chance of that happening it's probably even a better chance probably"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","787120","791480"," even a better chance than the crash scenario for where we are in a soft"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","791960","797360"," landing scenario that the bulls could have that so is it there yeah or is it"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","797360","802320"," possible yes it is I'll give it more to the bulls on I'm gonna give it more to"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","802320","805480"," the bulls right now and there's a reason for that okay I'm gonna show you guys"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","805480","807600"," something really quick I'm gonna do some cool for you guys for one second here"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","807600","812680"," I'll show you guys a couple cool things think tight one second here hold on"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","812680","813440"," here"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","813440","822000"," I keep a little space eater in my office like my office is has HVAC but I keep a"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","822000","826680"," little space eater this thing is awesome like my I can't keep it next to me I'll"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","826680","831280"," toast you warm and stuff but it's a little too hot right now so I'm gonna"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","831280","834320"," show you guys a couple things here but in this scenario okay what I'm what I'm"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","834320","836720"," talking about this scenario we're gonna talk about right now so just one quick"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","836720","844640"," second and here's another fascinating part even my friends like I got friend"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","844640","849440"," I'm in this real estate group I don't use Facebook but I'm I do use it for two"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","849440","853400"," things I use it for marketplace and I use it for a real estate investing group and"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","853400","856760"," I use it for Burning Man I have a Burning Man regional group and I'm in and"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","856760","860800"," then a real estate group I'm in and I do I do buy and sell stuff on Facebook"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","860800","865040"," time and time that's all use Facebook for anymore so on Facebook there's a"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","865040","868920"," group of investors okay these guys been in here with me I've been there I"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","868920","873920"," think since 2014 or 13 this group and this group has grown these guys have"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","873920","878200"," grown to in amazing ways now these guys are all talking about this cycle in and"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","878200","885680"," they're all getting ready to sell into strength into 26 for a roll down in"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","885680","890880"," 2028 okay and the idea here would be you're in a cycle of buying cheap"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","890880","895720"," property and you rent all these properties out Airbnb landlord whatever"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","895720","899040"," it is you're doing and then what you do is you unload into this market where"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","899040","903120"," this exuberation period comes in you unload into these people and then when"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","903120","906480"," this crash actually happens this housing crash actually happens I'll make them"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","906480","910680"," I'm like here here's a house and here's a rental for you it's $200,000 you pay"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","910680","914600"," for it and then I come back in six months or a year and I find you upside down"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","914600","917880"," getting torched right and I come back and buy it back from you for like a"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","917880","921400"," hundred K or something like that does that make sense so we're gonna look at"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","921400","927160"," that housing cycle really quick"

"zQuDa_e8OD8","1249400","1254160"," was roughly a year so what can we pause it from history soft landings last on"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1254160","1258680"," average of one and one and a quarter years we can also pause it at this point"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1258680","1264880"," that we have not raised rates so we are in the soft landing right now make sense"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1264880","1268720"," you guys all tracking that but what's the other fascinating part about these"

"zQuDa_e8OD8","1274480","1279840"," else is we can we pause it from this that in between every software or excuse me"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1279840","1286440"," ever no sorry that historically after every soft landing there we are followed"

"zQuDa_e8OD8","1309080","1316160"," the recession so the period between this here and this right here and check out"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1316160","1319560"," the dates there the soft landing ended in 1966 of"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1319640","1324960"," December right and the next recessionary period did not begin here for another"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1324960","1328800"," year and a half or year and two months on this soft landing right here that ended"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1328800","1336400"," in August of 84 the next recessionary period not begin for how long two three"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1336400","1341400"," years right and then this one right here this is the big boy right here where it"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1341400","1349520"," ended in February of 1995 and we had a we had an obscene obscene move into the"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1349560","1354800"," next recessionary period so what is that that's like a window right do you see"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1354800","1361080"," it now there's a window in between a soft landing in a recession guess who"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1361080","1365480"," controls that you know I'll tell you who it is it's the fucking fed in the"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1365480","1371280"," Treasury Department there's this moment in here there's a moment in here where"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1371280","1377600"," the fed fully controls where we go this is the this is the period that I'm"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1377640","1382800"," talking to you about where this is the period what a second here where I talk"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1382800","1388720"," to you about what happens in there and when I talk to you guys about the when"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1388720","1392760"," I talk to you guys about the largest or excuse me when I talk to you guys about"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1392760","1399240"," the time where the fed will commit the most fraud where they will massage their"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1399240","1405400"," numbers where they will try to manipulate the yield curve where they will fudge"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1405480","1409240"," the inflation numbers where they'll fudge the jobs numbers where they'll fudge"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1409240","1415640"," the unemployment numbers the velocity in this stuff is actually in the period"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1415640","1419240"," leading up that window during that soft landing the end of that soft landing"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1419240","1423560"," and into that window phase of the stock market now you can go back and clip that"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1423560","1428720"," stuff and at home I want you to snap some vertical lines on your own charts do"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1428720","1433760"," some homework over the weekend snap some vertical lines where those periods are"

"zQuDa_e8OD8","1446800","1451240"," the fascinating part I also want you to put on a chart at home I want you to"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1451240","1458080"," compare that to inflation unemployment in the fed funds rate when you compare"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1458080","1463680"," the rate of inflation the unemployment rates the fed funds rate against those"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1463680","1471040"," periods right it's fascinating what it shows you now that doesn't mean this"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1471040","1477200"," happens this time but if we're looking back on historical examples pre-prior"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1477200","1485120"," examples we have some potential for not only a bull run this year but it being"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1485120","1489840"," up to the fed how long that extends in that window so if we can pause it right"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1489880","1499320"," now that the soft landing began in late July right of 2023 it should last"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1499320","1505320"," until when at least one year right or at least historically into July possibly"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1505320","1513600"," even the end of the year of 2024 we also can pause it that the next"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1513600","1520480"," recessionary period does not begin right away right we have three examples"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1520480","1523600"," year and a half I think it was year and two months two or three years and then"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1523600","1529560"," five years now knowing those things knowing that a housing cycle is ending"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1529560","1538120"," this market can go up and not only can it go up they can have some of seen"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","1538120","1544160"," upside moves so when you're out there being a bear and you're like oh you know"

"zQuDa_e8OD8","2207520","2215280"," until the 17th that's right here do not expect weakness in the market until the 17th right now"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2216160","2221840"," if you scale out a little bit you scale up just a little bit right and you can see this parking"

"zQuDa_e8OD8","2226400","2232240"," down up down up what does this look like looks like parking it right market brings up price"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2233200","2237440"," and they're going to park this bad boy into the 17th so the weakness that i'm looking for right now"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2237440","2243840"," right weakness that i'm looking for doesn't look so weak does it does not look that weak is it so"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2243840","2247680"," the weakness the put spread that i have on is telling you we're likely going to trade for 70"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2248240","2254880"," as the target into opx now let's say we don't trade for so let's say opx it's actually up here at 480"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2254880","2259040"," or something like that right now if we get the unclunching on the 17th i'm going to at least be"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2259040","2265680"," hoping to be paying that into the 30 or into the 30th over here okay so for me and what i'm doing"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2265760","2270240"," here is i've got a put spread on for next week so this is my expectation into next week"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2271040","2278240"," that we are going to sell off into tuesday we are going to grind down and park the bus into opx"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2278960","2284080"," you might excuse me you might have another day or two up here and solidize would break underneath"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2284720","2289680"," bulls get all creepy or our bulls try to pull it back up right get the confirmation to the downside"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2289680","2294720"," leg over here and we get even more fur now i don't know if this put spread is going to pay me"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2296560","2300800"," well it's been paying me but i don't know if it's going to pay me like a full of 570 bucks"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2301760","2307040"," here it might not right might might squeeze up here in opx right so i have some time on this"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2307040","2312880"," on this trade so that i can get that print down here or i can get that print later on down here"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2312880","2317440"," when the when the unclunge comes in on the 17th now stating all of this saying all of this to you"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2318080","2323120"," for next week and into the end of january and one other thing here too would be this we got to"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2323120","2328320"," talk about something important here there's something else we have to talk about here"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2329120","2335840"," now this here we should make a big run to all-time highs but there's something important to say"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2335840","2341120"," here there's a trap in here for bulls okay there's a pretty big trap in here for bulls and i want to"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2341120","2347120"," talk about that with you right now if possible and that's going back to the 11th of january"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2347920","2351520"," so right here do you see where my cursor is right here you see this right here there's a trap"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2352400","2360320"," in here for bulls so i'm walking into my thesis for i'm walking into my thesis here for opx and for"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2360320","2363680"," the end of the month right and i'm like yeah everything is honky-dory i'm hoping to get a"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2363680","2369120"," print here or get a print down here the real problem here is that this gamma flip that's over"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2369120","2375280"," here let me just write that in there's a like a bull trap in here for a lot or i guess that's"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2375280","2378720"," black and better word or that is the right word but there's a bull trap in here with a gamma flip"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2379360","2387520"," so what does that mean to me as a bull i'm hoping for this turnaround up here and what can happen"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2387520","2392080"," to me is this come down here we come up here come down here and i'm all bulled up we're under the"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2392080","2397200"," gamma flip here and i'm thinking we're going to go to the moon and they roll me right down over"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2397200","2402880"," here so this is a cause for concern and we end up getting that low and in another low in february"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2402880","2407120"," like blood right bad news over here this is like a this is like i'm thinking we're going to go"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2407200","2411760"," to all-time highs and come back down into march for a low and there's actually a really dangerous"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2411760","2418240"," momentary in the market once we get underneath this gamma flip so if you are looking to if you"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2418240","2422800"," are following me on this trade and you're like yeah cap probably get that what i would say to you is"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2422800","2428640"," do not buy this right here this is a no buy for a bull unless we get above this gamma flip once"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2428640","2434160"," again so you'd have to wait until we climb above the gamma flip if it is right here you don't want"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2434240","2439120"," to see any development of new put walls to the downside and you want to see us start climbing"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2439120","2443600"," higher again and maybe even break these highs or even start getting long for that all-time high so"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2443600","2449040"," just be aware of the trap that's being set for bulls in here i don't know what andes out there"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2449040","2453040"," saying i don't know what gem is saying i don't i mean i follow those guys sometimes i see their"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2453040","2456720"," stuff and i'll comment or read it or whatever so i don't know what the basis is for you guys i"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2456720","2461760"," don't know what they're saying out there but i'm telling you that there is a setup here with this"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2461760","2465920"," gamma flip a trap for bulls where you think it's going up and they're going to drop you down"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2465920","2470480"," over here it's going to be a bloodbath so just be careful of this into not next week but as we"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2470480","2476000"," head down into this over here if you're a bear i'd be really concerned too if we do roll this down"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2476000","2481760"," into next week uh you're going to hear bears telling you the crash is coming uh on opx i'm"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2481760","2486480"," going to tell you that i don't believe that it makes more sense for us to go to the 31st as well"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2486480","2490080"," end of month because they still have end of month stuff even though you have opx over here you still"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2490160","2493280"," end of month stuff that needs to close a bunch of spreads and shit they need to close"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2493280","2496880"," so i would be really wary of as a matter of fact this line up here should go like this"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2500480","2505120"," this is oh wait a minute just a little trash this line actually likely goes back up"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2506320","2510480"," some point uh right back to where we were for opx right up there"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2512080","2515360"," so let's say if you're a bear right and yeah we're like doo doo doo doo sound"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2516640","2520000"," you're likely going to hear some asshole not asshole some asshole yeah some asshole on youtube"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2520000","2523920"," and some asshole on fucking finchwit couple assholes on bloomberg and on fucking wall street"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2523920","2527840"," journal and cmbc telling you crash you're going to try to get all crash business over here and"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2527840","2532160"," then you're going to be waiting so if there is a crash it's likely after the 31st bloodbath down"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2532160","2536080"," here and there is a bull trap here to be aware of but don't get all crazy down here"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2536080","2540400"," you're like if you're selling this down here don't be like yeah you know uh i'm fucking balls deep on"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2540400","2545120"," crash puts down here when in reality it's like a week down the road okay so just be aware of that"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2545120","2551920"," there's a setup here for um bulls to get really royally fucked uh it likely does not uh likely"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2551920","2556720"," doesn't begin the real true fucking infurbles does not begin until probably after the 31st"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2556720","2562000"," that's the highest probability can it come before in here yes but i don't see it happening uh i"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2562000","2566560"," don't so i don't see it happening in the time period uh that trap for bulls playing out as soon"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2566560","2571200"," as bears might think that it is so if you're a bear put your blinders on at some point trade that"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2571280","2575600"," down wait for this and your real true entry is probably somewhere in there okay probably like"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2575600","2579520"," right over here in the first or something like that heading into february if it's going to happen"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2580560","2585920"," if it's going to happen my thesis at this point stands uh weakness down here more weakness"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2585920","2591360"," continued weakness at the end of the end of the end of the month squeeze back up and my thesis is"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2591360","2597120"," still to the upside so i'm still on upside all-time highs on spx not e well not we probably get a"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2597120","2603040"," month es and spa because we've already had them but specifically all-time highs on spx and then a"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2603040","2609600"," real real correction when we get that correction it's going to be violence uh and you got to be"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2609600","2613920"," ready for it and there's something else here too if we know we're getting a correction they can"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2613920","2618080"," say yeah you know what fuck that we're just going to start selling and another thing about this uh"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2618080","2623120"," you have a flip here you get those real money flows in here you get like you get institutional"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2623520","2627520"," traders they could just say fuck you and you're all-time highs on spx and we just start heading"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2627520","2632320"," down so be really careful this in here mechanics of this now saying all of this for an expectation"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2632320","2636880"," for next week right as long as we stay above the hourly trigger and above the gamma flip the"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2636880","2641440"," bulls are still in charge here so for all my beard up bearishness into next week and the end of the"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2641440","2646240"," month i'm going to tell you that um if we if we bounce here in this gamma flip and start heading"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2646240","2650480"," higher i will ride that shit right up if we bounce off the hourly trigger and keep going higher i'll"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2650480","2654800"," ride it up i'll ride it up off fucking screen so be aware of that too so you've got two different"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2654800","2659280"," things here you've got the extreme bullish or bearishness to the downside be aware of it but"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2659280","2664400"," don't get crazy with it same thing for the bulls if you're if we're bouncing off the gamma flip and"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2664400","2668960"," we're bouncing off the hourly trigger and we're making new highs continue to trade this stuff up"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2668960","2674960"," even with your thesis or my thesis or whatever uh price action still rules always remember that you"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2674960","2681040"," will never stay in this market if you cannot adjust to a break of your own thesis when you see"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2681040","2686720"," people out there in public and they're like hey i'm a bearish here or i'm bullish i'm bullish i'm"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2686720","2691440"," bullish here right and i'm always buying tesla no matter what uh on highs lows don't new highs"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2691440","2694800"," whatever don't fucking be that that's not real those people aren't real that they're fake or"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2694800","2700240"," they got no money so if your thesis or my thesis gets broken be able to adjust to that thesis"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2700240","2704720"," breaking into next week and beyond but this is what i've got for next week this is what i think"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2704720","2709440"," happens next week this makes sense and actually this still fits some of these other uh people's"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2709440","2714960"," narratives for the uh 17th down here that parking job and you can kind of see it back here this is"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2714960","2718160"," familiar right you guys know what this is right here it's when they they're parking the fucking"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2718160","2721600"," bus for the end of the month end of the quarter you'll see this kind of action so for the end of"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2721600","2727440"," january this is what it looks like my expectation for op-x is a parking of the market at 470 you"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2727440","2733760"," should see them park it like fucking 470 and like 13 cents or something like that uh into uh or"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2733760","2739280"," excuse me into the 17th at uh four p.m. four four 70 so we may be even lower like right down here"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2739280","2744800"," going here in that right down there right there a little bit more a bit more and this isn't"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2744800","2748960"," selling is it this is like normal this if you look back in time uh this still fits the thesis of"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2748960","2754560"," some of those guys out there any questions on this specifically do you have any questions"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2755280","2759600"," let me see main screen here you guys could you guys get snaps of snips of that or whatever"

"zQuDa_e8OD8","2813280","2816480"," history says about the cues let me show it to you i want to show this to you guys"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2817360","2822560"," whoop hold on cap screen okay so cues uh do you want to explain exactly what happens in the cues"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2823280","2827600"," uh a bunch of you're going to say everything is fucking fine but they're going to do is grind"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2827600","2832960"," you down you're going to get that one update like uh like i have on uh the 17 uh opex and then"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2832960","2836160"," you're going to grind down again and the real move is going to come at the end of the month"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2836240","2840880"," okay so let me show this better on uh should i already closed out give me one quick second here"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2841840","2845520"," so what's going to happen is or what's likely to happen is this"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2847520","2852400"," a little out here i'm going to show you exactly what happens here on the uh purple for uh tech"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2852400","2858720"," bulls uh okay so where you see the blood here and on spoons what's going to happen is this"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2859520","2863680"," uh tech bulls you're going to come in and be like dude cap's wrong and you're going to grind just"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2863680","2868320"," like this okay you're not going to go up and you're not going to go down and then the last"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2868320","2872880"," minute you're going to get a bloodbath and then you're going to go up tire here for cues that's"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2872880","2878720"," our cues expectations uh if you are a theta gang uh you might have a great trade coming up on the cues"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2879600","2882400"," where you're going to hear bulls you're going to hear bulls for two straight weeks"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2884800","2887120"," talking that the market's going to go up the market's going to go up the market's going to go"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2887120","2889440"," up the market's going to go up and they're just going to get fucking trapped and they're going to"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2889440","2891840"," to get theta killed for like two weeks."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2891840","2893520"," So that's the Q's expectations."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2893520","2896920"," SPX has not touched all time highs yet,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2896920","2899120"," has not touched all time highs yet."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2899120","2900120"," So it has not."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2900120","2903280"," ES has, spy has, SPX has failed to do that."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2905480","2907880"," I'm still sitting in 477s."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2907880","2909520"," I did not buy the strike higher."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2910680","2911680"," I was sitting open right now,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2911680","2914280"," I'm in open order right here for 50 contracts."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2914280","2917200"," I didn't do 150, but I didn't buy them."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2917200","2919160"," Those are up to 55 cents right now."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2919160","2922040"," Those are like 25, just a few minutes ago."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2922040","2923560"," I'm at nine cents right now."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2923560","2926920"," I'm in for a total of about 27 cents on calls right now."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2926920","2928080"," That's what I'm in for right now."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2928080","2928920"," Right roughly there."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2928920","2931040"," I bought it, I think 34, and then I bought it 25,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2931040","2932440"," so whatever the difference is there."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2932440","2934840"," 27 or 29 or something like that, somewhere in there."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2934840","2936200"," Maybe it's higher, maybe it's about 30 cents,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2936200","2938200"," maybe I'm lying to you."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2938200","2939800"," So we'll see what happens in this close right now."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2939800","2941440"," And I never executed the second last part"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2941440","2942440"," of that trade on this higher strike,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2942440","2944040"," so we'll find out what happens."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2944040","2948360"," So on losses, right?"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2948360","2949320"," You're going to take loss."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2949320","2951200"," Just, if you're a new trader, right?"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2951200","2953040"," When I was a young trader, I remember things,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2953040","2956880"," like something stood out to me, trading size."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2956880","2959120"," I went through the motions of like trading 500 bucks,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2959120","2960480"," trading 1,000 bucks, being scared,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2960480","2964400"," trading 5,000, being scared, trading 10,000, 15,000, 20,000."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2964400","2967080"," And then eventually I started trading real size,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2967080","2969280"," and I got really destroyed."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2969280","2974440"," I got destroyed from about $30,000 to about $100,000."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2974440","2975520"," Now I blamed it on everything,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2975520","2978080"," and I still to this day believe some of that,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2978080","2980160"," that they watch what you're trading,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2980160","2981920"," what you're doing, they package you."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2981920","2983400"," These order flow things, like there's like packaging,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2983400","2984520"," like this guy's doing this,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2984520","2985840"," and then we package all this shit over here."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2985840","2987720"," We add this stuff where we need to add it,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2987720","2990280"," or there's like a software that does that."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2990280","2993120"," So I don't trade that size anymore, for me personally."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2993120","2995280"," But my point here is, now you get scared"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2995280","2996720"," as you trade more size and stuff like that."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2996720","2999080"," I pull back what I'm trading and size and stuff like that."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","2999080","3001040"," Same thing applies for large losses."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3001040","3003360"," If you have large losses, when that happens,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3003360","3005080"," you need to go back and look and see what's working,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3005080","3006600"," what did work, what doesn't work,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3006600","3009640"," and move back into that system, or find a system,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3009640","3011000"," where if you don't like,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3011000","3013480"," hey, I look back on my trading history and none of that works,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3013480","3016440"," then you have to learn a system that does consistently pay you."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3016440","3018560"," You have to have that."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3018560","3019400"," So you have to have that."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3019400","3021880"," You have to find a way to find a system"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3021880","3025000"," that consistently you can make money from."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3025000","3028240"," So an example on this, I day trade, right?"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3028240","3033240"," But for me, I also trade oversold bounces with call spreads."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3034920","3036400"," And I get yelled at for that too."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3036400","3038160"," People are like, why don't you buy zero dates,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3038160","3039000"," or a weeklies down there?"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3039000","3040320"," You're gonna make way more money."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3040320","3041760"," But when I back tested those systems,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3041760","3043240"," they don't consistently pay."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3043240","3046000"," So I need a consistent way to always keep myself funded"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3046000","3048120"," if I do blow up for me personally."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3048120","3049720"," So I do the call spread thing."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3049720","3053120"," I buy stock on major lows, I buy stock,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3053120","3055040"," that gives me more money too, right?"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3055040","3056000"," Then I'm not losing it."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3056000","3057520"," Well, I don't realize those losses"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3057520","3058840"," unless they go down even deeper."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3058840","3060840"," And I'm looking for like real good deals."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3060840","3065040"," So on those underlying stock itself for shares."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3065040","3066480"," And then I fuck around day trading"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3066480","3068800"," because I'm a goddamn gambler, right?"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3068800","3071520"," If I was only a place one or 10 trades a year,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3071520","3072880"," I'd be fucking rich."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3072880","3073680"," But you know what we do?"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3073680","3074520"," You know what we all do it, right?"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3074520","3075840"," You get on CNBC, you get on Fintuit,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3075840","3077640"," you get on Wall Street Pet Stock, which whatever it is,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3077640","3079360"," and you have to be involved in the market."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3079360","3081040"," So that's what I do with day trade."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3081040","3082120"," I fuck around in the market."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3082120","3084000"," And as a matter of fact, I used to not day trade"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3084000","3085880"," as much as I do now, streaming."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3085880","3088080"," So streaming, like people like take a trade,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3088080","3089280"," take a trade, take a trade."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3089280","3091120"," So even my wins on day trade and I've gone"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3091120","3092600"," my percentage wins, I've gone down."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3092600","3093760"," It used to be a really good date."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3093760","3095480"," Well, that's two sides of this."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3095480","3096840"," I used to be a really good day trader"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3096840","3098760"," because I only traded 10 trend days."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3099640","3101440"," You guys being here with me,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3101440","3103480"," I started trading more than I ever did."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3103480","3105520"," And that was a double edged sword."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3105520","3108360"," So my win percentage is lower now,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3108360","3110600"," but I've become a better trader."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3110600","3113920"," So I'm kind of paying for a better day trader education"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3113920","3114880"," in this process."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3114880","3117320"," I don't know where that leads me to in the future"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3117320","3118880"," because I've never experienced this in my life."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3118880","3122200"," I've had no career of over trading for two years,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3122200","3123120"," three years now."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3124520","3125600"," I don't know where that leads."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3125600","3127160"," If I take a major loss from it,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3128520","3131840"," I'll have to reconsider what I'm doing with that."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3131840","3132800"," I'll have to reconsider."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3132800","3136160"," Right now, I'm generally up about 15 to 30% day trading"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3136160","3138640"," at the end of a year, but I was way, way higher,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3138640","3141280"," way higher before I was screaming."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3141280","3144080"," So it could be over trading too, it could be an issue."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3146600","3150200"," I'm on a, I think I got a hundred contracts right now."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3150240","3151560"," Not nine cents right now."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3151560","3153040"," I'm taking a pretty fucking big hit."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3153040","3155560"," I never took the higher strike trade."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3155560","3159160"," So I wish I had, I wish I could tell you that I did"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3159160","3160760"," for like high, I fucking lied to you."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3160760","3161760"," I'd be like, yeah, I'd grab that."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3161760","3162960"," I'm fucking making money right now,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3162960","3164880"," but I'm not getting towards right now."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3164880","3165720"," Getting fucking ate up."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3165720","3168280"," So I'm hoping on a creepy crawly to the clothes on."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3168280","3171480"," I'm hoping on a fucking no based and no logic."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3173120","3174400"," And not thinking that that's gonna happen here."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3174400","3175320"," I think they're gonna pin this fucker"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3175320","3176840"," and burn all the shit into the clothes here."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3176840","3179200"," That's what I think they're gonna do is burn all this shit."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3181200","3182560"," Three thirty seven right now."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3182560","3185200"," We got another 20, we got another 23 minutes here."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3189200","3192200"," Oh, oh, that's, oh, you have a question about a hundred packs"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3192200","3193200"," and stuff."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3193200","3194200"," So how do I day trade?"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3194200","3197200"," Sometimes it's a 25, sometimes it's 50, sometimes it's 100."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3197200","3201200"," I used to be, I used to day trade and just order 300 packs."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3201200","3203200"," Like 300 pack, 300 pack, 300 pack, 300 pack."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3203200","3205200"," I felt like, I felt like they were watching me."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3205200","3208200"," I felt like I was getting sold into an order flow for pennies."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3208200","3210200"," And so it kind of pissed me off."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3210200","3211200"," So I stopped."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3211200","3212200"," I don't do that anymore."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3212200","3215200"," Mostly it's 100 packs, 25s and 50s."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3215200","3217200"," That's mostly what I trade these days."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3217200","3219200"," I trade way smaller than I ever used to."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3219200","3223200"," I got really fucking, I got, not recently."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3223200","3224200"," It's been a while."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3224200","3227200"," It's been maybe a year and a half or a year ago."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3227200","3228200"," I stopped doing it."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3228200","3231200"," I felt like I was being taken for a ride from these guys."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3231200","3234200"," And most recently I've had a trading platform"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3234200","3236200"," that I'm actually watching it happen in real time."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3236200","3238200"," I've gotten refunds, dude, for this shit."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3238200","3242200"," I called them, I broke them and I'm like, man, you guys are fucking taking me for a ride here."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3242200","3245200"," So I try to stay out of the cover now, right?"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3245200","3248200"," I don't want to be like, oh, there's some guy buying 30 grand in this and 50 grand in that"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3248200","3251200"," and 100 fucking grand in this and that kind of stupid shit."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3251200","3254200"," Packaged up a bunch of retailers and just fucking tore it for a few minutes."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3254200","3257200"," Seriously, that shit pisses me off, man."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3257200","3258200"," I believe it happens."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3258200","3261200"," From my experience, I think it happens over time."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3261200","3263200"," I think my brokers are involved in it, too."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3263200","3264200"," But no names."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3264200","3265200"," I'm not naming any names."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3265200","3266200"," I think it happens frequently."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3266200","3267200"," Daytray."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3267200","3269200"," This isn't spreads and stuff like that."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3269200","3272200"," Like a spread I can call a broker usually get a better price."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3272200","3273200"," And that all works out fine."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3273200","3274200"," They've had a problem with that."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3274200","3276200"," But zero dates in the chain."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3276200","3277200"," I don't think it's the broker."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3277200","3282200"," I don't know if it's a, I blame my broker, but I think it's more the software is written"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3282200","3286200"," to execute and bundle these packages of calls and puts."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3286200","3291200"," And you get put into a group and they round you off with small buys and all that."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3291200","3292200"," So now I just trade small money."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3292200","3293200"," But it's not small."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3293200","3295200"," It's not as small as you think it is."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3295200","3298700"," You're still trading fucking two, three, four, five thousand, six thousand is the average"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3298700","3304000"," right around there on these trades or I build into that trade about that amount of money."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3304000","3307700"," So then the one other thing that I like about zero dates, I was a bunch of stuff about"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3307700","3308700"," zero dates we should talk about."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3308700","3310200"," I like zero dates because I'm on the hook."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3310200","3312400"," I've been on the hook of futures."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3312400","3315600"," You know, you're trading fucking something for five, 10 grand and then you walk away,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3315600","3318200"," you come back and you're on the hook for a hundred K, right?"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3318200","3320200"," A hundred thousand, sixty thousand, something like that."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3320200","3322200"," Because you're using somebody else's money, right?"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3322200","3323200"," So it's just zero dates."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3323200","3328200"," I have defined losses and I'm not, I'm not, when I close my laptop into the fucking day,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3328200","3331200"," it's not like panic that I'm blowing up my account to come back on a fucking Monday"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3331200","3334200"," and they get a fucking maintenance shit and I get fucking closing."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3334200","3337200"," They open the position against me and I'm fucking, they got me by the fucking balls."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3337200","3339200"," I don't know if you've ever been through that."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3339200","3344200"," Matter of fact, if you trade futures, I would always use somebody else's money, man."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3344200","3347200"," If you're a regular futures trader, why not just trade somebody else's?"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3347200","3349200"," I see the value in that."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3349200","3351200"," Like, I guess a lot of you guys do prop trading out there."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3351200","3355200"," You pay, what, two, three, four, five hundred bucks, trade somebody else's money."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3359200","3361200"," I'm telling, I'm telling you guys, man, I know you guys don't believe me,"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3361200","3364200"," or not don't believe me about that this shit going on with this."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3364200","3369200"," If you ever trade size with zero dates, I mean size, like 50, 60, hundred thousand."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3369200","3371200"," I'm telling you, they fucking do it to you."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3371200","3373200"," From my experience, they do."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3374200","3379200"," From my experience, it's like they take a chunk out."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3379200","3383200"," They don't care if it goes up, but they take five to 15K and pocket that shit."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3383200","3384200"," Then they don't care what you're doing."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3384200","3385200"," That's how I feel about it."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3385200","3389200"," I feel like I'm going in with like 100K and immediately I get nailed for like five or 15K"
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3389200","3390200"," and then they're like, fuck it."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3390200","3391200"," We don't care where the market goes from here."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3391200","3392200"," We took the money from them."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3392200","3394200"," That shit bugs the fuck out of me."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3394200","3395200"," So it really does."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3395200","3396200"," It grinds my ass."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3396200","3400200"," It's changed fundamentally my trading habits."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3400200","3401200"," I don't know if it's real."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3401200","3402200"," I don't know if it's fake."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3403200","3404200"," I don't know if it's just my imagination."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3404200","3407200"," I don't know if I've come up with some kind of like voodoo or whatever."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3407200","3409200"," But for me, it never works for me."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3409200","3412200"," So I don't do it anymore."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3412200","3413200"," Not anymore."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3413200","3414200"," I'll get the caveat."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3414200","3416200"," Like 98 percent of the time I don't do it."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3416200","3418200"," But every once in a while, yes."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3418200","3419200"," I have done that."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3419200","3423200"," But 99 out of 100 times, I don't do it anymore."
"zQuDa_e8OD8","3432200","3434200"," It helps support the community."
