"347300","351800"," You hear me?"
"353180","354020"," Yeah."
"356460","358100"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"359980","365160"," Can you guys see the my screener inside of the stock market set?"
"369060","370280"," Can you make it a bit large?"
"370500","371960"," Can you make it larger or no?"
"385560","389000"," Is it possible to make the screen larger so you can see it or no?"
"391380","392140"," You can make it larger."
"394080","394640"," All right. "
"394960","397460"," So let me bring my microphone over here."
"400480","401640"," So you can zoom in."
"401880","406200"," So if any of you guys aren't in the if any of you guys aren't in the. "
"408480","411720"," You can make it larger because people are confirming that you can make it larger."
"412120","418920"," So what that will do is it will show you the options flow as it comes in a live stream"
"418920","420240"," all day long for you today."
"421060","424920"," Let me mute my button here at least so you guys aren't hearing an echo. "
"426060","426760"," Hold on here."
"426840","427740"," I'll just talk into YouTube."
"430600","431000"," Okay. "
"431280","433440"," So what I'll do is I'll leave up."
"433840","437880"," If you guys aren't in Captain Jim James discord, I'll put a link in the chat box of YouTube."
"439840","442780"," Can you guys still hear me on the panel or no?"
"445300","451350"," Like people. "
"457610","459370"," I'm going to mute this down here."
"460530","462150"," I got these here you guys talking now."
"467250","468550"," Hold on here. "
"468570","469870"," I want to listen to you guys talk."
"472830","473670"," All right."
"474290","477490"," So you guys should be able to see my screen. "
"477490","482210"," And I can at least hear you guys talking in the chat."
"482390","485830"," So if you guys are chatting in the chat, I can hear you guys in the background talking."
"485990","491650"," I don't think that the microphone picks it up in YouTube, but you'll be able to see the you'll see. "
"495610","499050"," You guys are able to see you guys should be able to see flow."
"499050","504050"," I'll go inside of discord all day long."
"504050","506490"," I think I'm not positive on that. "
"506790","509090"," Don't hold me to that, but I think you can."
"511110","513110"," So let me print this off here."
"516450","523810"," All kinds of weird stuff going on. "
"540890","542450"," Give me just a second here."
"542490","544950"," I got to load my screens up here and make sure I get everything going."
"546870","547450"," All right. "
"547510","550670"," So what I think is this you can hear me."
"551510","554430"," Yeah, it's kind of weird, right?"
"554550","555690"," You have both of them open now."
"556130","558490"," So what you'll do is what I'll be like is this. "
"559410","561390"," I got a whole bunch of new shit for you."
"561890","563450"," So this has taken me a while."
"563630","564410"," I'll just make a brief. "
"564550","565690"," I'll take like a five minute conversation."
"565770","572190"," I'm trying to set up a bigger, better studio and it's been more work than I ever anticipated."
"572950","579670"," If you when you like starting out and it's basic and then as I'm adding as I'm adding options and"
"579670","583070"," different things to the to the live stream, it's just become more complicated. "
"583070","585690"," We're going to upgrade and upgrade and upgrade and upgrade."
"585810","587730"," And I have other stuff to show you this morning."
"588130","592850"," So like I can switch before like I can I can I got a whole bunch of shit that I"
"592850","593310"," can do now. "
"603240","606380"," So there's a bunch of stuff that I can there's actually a bunch of stuff that I can do with"
"606380","606900"," you guys now."
"606900","608160"," Like I can switch between screens."
"609180","611260"," I can switch to a chart screen. "
"611620","612980"," I think we'll see if I can."
"615950","616690"," Hello here."
"617950","622750"," So you can switch to the screen now and just goes direct to a chart with you so that you"
"622750","625270"," can look at it at a at a screener for a chart. "
"625270","633330"," So if we want to bounce back and forth between say book map and the charting software, I think"
"633330","633630"," we're good."
"634070","637070"," And then I'm sorry, I'm talking of the interns here."
"637410","639710"," So I can switch back and forth between book map. "
"639950","644390"," I can switch back and forth between calendars and wherever's going on here and book map."
"644670","645230"," That kind of stuff."
"645410","646310"," And then you guys will be able to see. "
"647910","649030"," You guys will be able to see."
"651510","654030"," The flow all day long and discord."
"654970","656150"," So second live stream. "
"656850","660770"," You can keep that up if you want to check that or if we're going to discuss that possibly at"
"660770","661230"," some point."
"662010","665610"," If I say bring up bring up some flow that's coming in, you can go over to discord and check"
"665610","666030"," that out."
"666830","672010"," And then I've got I switched news providers, but I don't know what's going on with that fucking"
"672010","672230"," thing. "
"672530","673990"," I don't know what's going on."
"674190","680710"," Like I sign up for a new a new new service and it's saying that my payment is still being"
"680710","681810"," processed or something."
"682450","683370"," The boys are asleep. "
"683830","684210"," I don't know."
"684630","686690"," So at some point today we'll have market news."
"688870","692530"," On the YouTube channel, but it still hasn't happened yet. "
"692830","693370"," So I'm either getting."
"695210","697510"," I'm not getting taken for a ride or not."
"697510","698670"," I'm not sure at this point. "
"700130","701750"," So good morning to all of you out there."
"703250","705030"," It's kind of weird having me on both right."
"705390","707530"," You guys can't hear me in discord right now, can you?"
"708070","709510"," Tell me you can't hear me in discord. "
"718320","718800"," Excuse me."
"720380","720760"," Okay."
"721240","724820"," So I want to know that I don't want you to hear double voice. "
"725080","726740"," So I only want you to hear me in YouTube."
"727540","729620"," I'll listen to you guys talk in discord."
"730420","734100"," So if you guys want to shout out or something in discord, I can hear you in my in my"
"734100","736100"," in my in my in my earpiece or something. "
"736480","739220"," Talking in the background, but I don't want my voice to be double speak."
"739440","742360"," I don't want to have to deal with two voices going."
"743420","744380"," So just let me know. "
"744760","745620"," Yeah, you can't hear me in discord."
"745840","746400"," That's fucking awesome."
"746680","746980"," All right. "
"747180","747200"," Good."
"747820","748180"," All right."
"748380","750220"," So let's get started on some shit here this morning. "
"750220","750560"," Okay."
"750880","752000"," Because we got a lot to go through."
"752340","756440"," I'm a little, a little pissed off right now about what's going on. "
"757000","758640"," So I got, I want to ask you guys."
"758880","763300"," So I have a conference that I'm going to be in the next couple days."
"763300","767720"," Go listening to some information on the FOMC meeting. "
"770280","773280"," This morning we had retail sales."
"773400","773700"," Excuse me."
"773780","774980"," We had a not this wrong day. "
"776180","780340"," So today on the 17th, we had initial claims, continuing claims, building permits, housing starts,"
"780640","780920"," Philly fed."
"781240","782420"," This is the big one Philly fed."
"783340","786800"," And the industrial production next capacity utilization rate. "
"787340","789520"," But other than that, we don't have a ton on the boards for today."
"789640","791600"," I think I'm going to have some oil numbers coming out later today."
"791600","794960"," But I'm a ton on the board today and we don't see that much weakness. "
"795440","800320"," And if anything, I'm going to switch over real quick and just show you a quick, quick, quick chart"
"800320","800660"," right here."
"800740","800860"," Okay."
"801220","806660"," I just wanted to see that it's just natural for us to trade down in this channel that we're in"
"806660","806980"," today. "
"807360","813520"," So this doesn't say to me that even the Philly fed matters this morning that we're just selling off"
"813520","813740"," briefly."
"813760","818160"," We should have some weakness and we're going to be looking for support here on book map this"
"818160","818480"," morning."
"818480","823880"," We'll bounce back and forth between book map and the charts today and see if we catch this bounce"
"823880","824200"," here. "
"824520","827320"," Or if we don't catch this bounce and we start to trade the lower."
"830100","834240"," So what I really want is what I really want you guys to see today is watch my cursor here."
"834600","839880"," You're going to be looking for some support to be found down here between 430, 102, 429, 95,"
"840240","841700"," somewhere in here right 430 basically. "
"842220","843160"," You're looking for some support."
"844260","847320"," Now another thing we could do is green bar straight up here and reject."
"847780","848840"," This is what the bears wanted. "
"848980","851900"," They want to see us green bar it up off the bell, right?"
"852100","854780"," Ricochet off 439, 440 somewhere in here."
"855160","860480"," Maybe even higher you could see it up here at 441, 78 and then a firm rejection down into Friday."
"860920","863260"," Now we are in OPEC's this week. "
"863660","867020"," We all we have OPEC's and then we've got end of month coming up, right?"
"867020","873240"," And so there's a chance that we're going to trade back out down into this zone at some point, or"
"873240","876300"," even trade sideways over time as time moves forward."
"876660","879560"," Now the bulls are going to say, well, we're going to go much higher cap."
"879700","881040"," We're going way out of this trading channel. "
"881300","882420"," We're just going to explode here."
"882500","883460"," We're going to talk about that."
"883560","886860"," We're going to talk about the macro environment to the market this morning. "
"886860","890800"," I want to know what your thoughts are on it versus what my takeaway was on FOMC."
"891080","894220"," But what I'm looking for this morning is a nice bounce down here."
"894220","899440"," If we revisit the previous low over here, if we come back down to 425, we'll look for it on"
"899440","900100"," BookMap, right?"
"900460","903160"," So I'm going to be looking for a bounce down below and then a trade higher. "
"903600","905020"," If we hold here, we're good to go."
"905100","910220"," If we trade below, then we're going to look for some rejection off of this channel and a trade"
"910220","911160"," lower from here."
"911820","913960"," So we'll trade this live this morning. "
"914520","915760"," We'll make some money today."
"916420","922280"," So we'll see how the market reacts this morning off the bell and see if we're going to trade lower"
"922280","923000"," off the bell here."
"923000","924280"," That's what I think is going to have. "
"924380","927940"," We're going to trade down below here, find some support, and then we'll move higher."
"928440","933160"," Now, if we don't get that reaction down below on 430, then we start to trade below."
"933940","939420"," We'll take that trade on the short side, heading down even deeper back down here. "
"939960","941460"," Now, let's get back to..."
"941460","943880"," We're going to go to the spot gamma report for this morning."
"945260","949060"," So futures are at 435 down from overnight highs of 4367."
"949060","952680"," With yesterday's rally up, there was a sharp reduction negative gamma. "
"953240","955080"," We know that we had gamma fall off yesterday."
"955640","959060"," We had a daily OPEC yesterday."
"959660","961380"," Huge puts fall off. "
"961640","964780"," We have huge puts falling off on Friday as well."
"965460","968240"," And however, we still forecast high volatility for today."
"968600","970980"," A 1.4% open to close move. "
"971460","973220"," That's a pretty big move for us today, right?"
"973220","977760"," Resistance lies at 434, 8, and 440..."
"977760","980080"," or 4400 support shows."
"980340","981260"," And we'll look back on this chart."
"982460","983780"," You see it up here, right?"
"983960","985580"," This is that zone of resistance. "
"986220","988740"," Volatility somewhere up in this area here, right?"
"991600","996100"," And support shows at 4330 and 4300, right?"
"997120","1007820"," So 4330 is roughly right here,"
"1007880","1008800"," right where we're sitting on."
"1009340","1010860"," We'll actually switch these out here."
"1012940","1014120"," Let's move this up here. "
"1014660","1016040"," 4330, right?"
"1016700","1018560"," And then our next support..."
"1019740","1021720"," We can move this one up here..."
"1022640","1025099"," is 4300, right?"
"1025240","1028040"," So we're going to look right up in here and we're going to look for our support."
"1028040","1030240"," That's 4300 right here, right?"
"1030359","1031940"," We already know this channel that we're in."
"1032020","1034900"," We're looking for this to hold here this morning. "
"1035220","1038560"," Matter of fact, I'm going to move this somewhere up in there."
"1039720","1041140"," Somewhere up right in there."
"1041220","1041980"," I'm going to look for another bound. "
"1042140","1043440"," We might as well sell it all the way down here."
"1045160","1050160"," For the past several weeks, I've been looking for a rally, catalyzed by a post-FOMC implied event"
"1050160","1051980"," volatility reduction and OPEX."
"1052100","1055900"," Accordingly, we felt that a bullish Fed response could pull forward some of the OPEX rally. "
"1056660","1059440"," Market movement so far coincides with this outline."
"1060140","1061480"," The volatility crush is quite clear."
"1061560","1064880"," Shum below is the VIX term structure from Monday, Blue versus today. "
"1066500","1070800"," This curve, which the barometer of IV suggests a decrease in value of the SP500 put options."
"1071260","1077100"," As put options lose value, those that are short puts have to buy back short stock hedges."
"1077820","1079440"," This is the VANA trade, right?"
"1080900","1085240"," Along with the decline in IV, we saw a big stock rally in time passing. "
"1085820","1090160"," Yesterday or the day before I posted that the easiest trade for you to take, because you had some"
"1090160","1093780"," volcrush, even on the call side, was to take spreads, right?"
"1093960","1096500"," Pick up spreads because you won't deal with that volcrush."
"1096720","1101180"," I even noticed it trading yesterday that even though I was making gains, they had to be in the"
"1101180","1102980"," money calls on zero dates."
"1103460","1107820"," There was no money on outside the money calls yesterday or the day before, or there are on the put"
"1107820","1108280"," side either. "
"1108700","1110100"," It had to be kind of be right in there."
"1110760","1112020"," Those add to the put destruction."
"1112020","1115640"," Take, for example, the value of March 18th, 4,000 put chart below. "
"1116260","1122160"," There were greater than 100k of these open for Friday's expiration, and the value of those was"
"1122160","1124400"," decimated from Monday into today."
"1124860","1125840"," Our takeaway here is simple."
"1126480","1128420"," This is a short cover rally through put destruction. "
"1129040","1131360"," Short cover rallies are inherently unstable."
"1132360","1137720"," The other major signal we picked up yesterday was the total lack of positive call deltas in the"
"1137720","1139180"," spies and the queues."
"1139180","1142140"," You can see below that spy traders are fairly heavy call sellers. "
"1142540","1146400"," It appears to be in the money call sellers into the AM short stock cover."
"1146640","1149040"," And then after 1pm through the FMC flow was neutral."
"1149820","1152640"," The QQQ chart was similar. "
"1152860","1157140"," If the Fed tripped some macro bicycling, you'd think response from call buyers and put sellers"
"1157140","1159140"," would be significant positive deltas."
"1159380","1160900"," We didn't see that yesterday."
"1161360","1162240"," That is a key. "
"1162500","1166140"," We saw short covering yesterday, but we didn't see an over like the double."
"1166140","1168300"," We didn't see puts, puts lose value."
"1168760","1174760"," And we didn't see an overwhelming buy from retail or from banks from the announcement yesterday"
"1174760","1175300"," into the close. "
"1176580","1177060"," Right."
"1177280","1182040"," So if the Fed trips to macro buy signals, you'd think the response from call buyers and put sellers"
"1182040","1183880"," would be significant positive deltas."
"1184180","1184580"," Right. "
"1184840","1189840"," Looking forward, we still have 30% of total deltas in the SPX spy Q set to expire tomorrow."
"1190000","1194160"," From the gamma perspective below, you can see how much is set to expire."
"1194160","1199580"," Like gray area is shaded and note that 4,300 is a major support strike. "
"1200220","1202060"," And that's right down here at 4,300."
"1202540","1202620"," Okay."
"1203920","1209100"," They're not going to want to trade below this and they're not going to want to trade higher than"
"1209100","1210920"," this 4,400 right in here. "
"1211180","1212920"," Somewhere in this zone right here."
"1213460","1217060"," Accordingly, we think OPEC's flows will continue to continue to be supportive of markets into"
"1217060","1217380"," Friday."
"1217780","1222060"," However, we are currently having a hard time finding data that implies options based support into"
"1222060","1222620"," next week. "
"1222620","1227840"," This would change if we see a pickup and call flows and or a push above 4,400 in the"
"1227840","1228200"," S&P."
"1228460","1229580"," This is key down here."
"1230220","1231820"," We're not seeing that flow. "
"1231980","1232840"," We didn't see it yesterday."
"1233320","1234860"," And as a matter of fact, I looked yesterday."
"1235180","1236660"," I'm going to bring this up for you real quick. "
"1237660","1238720"," Actually, I can't right now."
"1238720","1239060"," Hold on a second."
"1243780","1247500"," What I'm going to bring up at some point is going to bring up a chart that shows the call"
"1247500","1250220"," flow that came in yesterday was all dated for the 16th. "
"1250280","1252340"," There was minimal data for the 18th."
"1252340","1256640"," There was some, but there wasn't a ton far dated out and farther out of the money."
"1257080","1261460"," We didn't see 4,500 calls dated two weeks or three weeks. "
"1261500","1262360"," We didn't see any of that."
"1262580","1264000"," We didn't see any kind of call flow."
"1264660","1269880"," Like 80% of it was dated yesterday for the 16th, 20% for the 18th. "
"1270540","1276160"," So we know typically what happens on days like an in-between OPEC stay in the spot."
"1276460","1281380"," If you're not going to see the bid coming to the market, you'll see us trade sideways or even down."
"1282200","1283820"," And killing call options. "
"1284260","1288020"," You might remember, you know how in the past we talked about, hey, if I'm going to buy a one"
"1288020","1289340"," date or a two date or a three date."
"1289660","1294760"," So there's that middle day where you've got overpriced call options."
"1295140","1296380"," So we'll look for that today. "
"1296500","1300840"," We'll see if Friday strike calls are over overpriced this morning."
"1301580","1307100"," And see if they need to lose some value before you buy them for the close on Friday."
"1307220","1308740"," We're going to keep our eyes out on flow. "
"1308740","1311940"," I'll go for a bid into the market when we are seeing that."
"1312180","1316600"," We are actually seeing an advanced on the advanced the client is a bit in the market."
"1317500","1319280"," It's in real stock purchasing. "
"1319760","1324560"," We've seen it for the past since Monday at least or I've seen it at least since Monday."
"1325260","1329060"," But what they're buying is interesting and we'll look at that this morning as well."
"1329500","1334660"," All these 52 week low companies have been coming in for the past few days like wing stop. "
"1334940","1337220"," You saw it and I got a list of them."
"1337620","1339000"," I actually have a list of them over here."
"1339060","1339820"," I'm going to look at real quick. "
"1340300","1346780"," I saw and I'm in a couple of calls to some traders out there where I was talking about."
"1346900","1347600"," Hold on a second here."
"1353720","1354620"," But you saw 50. "
"1354840","1356220"," I have to bring the list up a little bit."
"1356280","1357100"," But I had a list of them."
"1357240","1363200"," There were a list of these companies like Twilio like weird companies that were on dog days 52 week"
"1363200","1363480"," lows. "
"1363940","1365940"," They all caught bids the last two or three days."
"1366400","1368680"," Matter of fact, you saw SP spy was up on Monday."
"1368680","1373120"," I think it was green and the market was red like Apple was down. "
"1373600","1379300"," So you're seeing a rotation going on early for Opex and you're more than likely will see that that"
"1379300","1384300"," Opex rotation continue even though the does bid in the market."
"1384300","1393520"," You might not see let's say spy fly until after Friday this Friday or even as far into the 31st"
"1393520","1394960"," believe it or not of March."
"1394980","1396800"," You might not actually see it. "
"1396980","1397900"," What does that mean for you?"
"1397900","1402280"," It means that the right around now is two things you need to be watching and be careful of."
"1402660","1407280"," You need to be really fucking careful that this by of the market is fake."
"1408100","1408400"," Right. "
"1408520","1410020"," They're not going to sell this market down."
"1410420","1417080"," You need to start looking at stocks that are having beaten down to their lows almost of March 2020."
"1417480","1420320"," If you're going to take them long into June, right. "
"1421220","1426260"," Companies that actually produce something that can handle inflation will get an inflation later."
"1426260","1433380"," But companies that can pass inflation along to their customer base and of goods and services that"
"1433380","1437160"," people are going to buy no matter what, even if inflation is high."
"1437940","1442920"," We saw that move into those companies Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. "
"1443500","1445600"," So you can buy and hold those stocks from now."
"1446320","1449820"," Let's say into April or June still worried about the market selling off."
"1449820","1457440"," And also, if you're going to take a position in options, the only safe bet really is to be taking"
"1457440","1460100"," like call flies or taking call spreads and the money. "
"1460420","1467920"," They're dated out into April, June, even possibly even into June as we trade from now into end of"
"1467920","1468140"," month."
"1468140","1471740"," And if you let's say you're like, Oh, cap, I missed yesterday cap."
"1471960","1473700"," I didn't buy spreads yesterday at the bottom. "
"1474080","1475520"," I was too afraid that of 425."
"1476340","1481080"," There's probably a chance of a seeing a lower number between now and 31st."
"1481320","1485220"," It could be this Friday and it could actually be the 31st of March. "
"1485740","1486560"," We say another dip."
"1486700","1486980"," It's possible."
"1487280","1489920"," So if you if you're like, Oh, I missed the cap and I don't want to do it now. "
"1490380","1494740"," There's probably a chance for you to buy again a low somewhere."
"1494740","1500880"," Somewhere this week, I would say somewhere between Friday, you might see it down to 420 and you"
"1500880","1501840"," might even see it down to 405."
"1502300","1506800"," But it's not going to really matter if you buy a call spread that's nice and wide and it doesn't"
"1506800","1507440"," expire. "
"1507740","1511340"," And so let's say April 31st or late June."
"1512000","1514120"," So you guys can start to take this market long."
"1514380","1518740"," If you're still afraid and we're going to talk about what FOMC really meant. "
"1519120","1521080"," We're going to talk about the risks associated with it."
"1521080","1524640"," If they're going to sell this market down, if we're going to get uber super duper bearish."
"1524740","1530180"," If you're going to see the rotation trade where there's a bid in the market and they trade us up"
"1530180","1534000"," to, let's say 450 and they pull the rug on us and send us down to 400. "
"1534480","1535500"," That's that's fine too."
"1535880","1542560"," But the key is you have to take the take these trades to a price and also you can put"
"1542560","1544540"," some risk protection on."
"1544540","1546420"," We've talked about put back spreads. "
"1546960","1552240"," I would be looking to put some more put back spreads on somewhere around four four four four four"
"1552240","1556020"," zero zero or even four five zero zero."
"1556260","1559780"," You can put on some put back spreads data about three months."
"1559800","1564320"," We're ready to start of an opx period right or excuse me a quad witching. "
"1564820","1565980"," Throw them on for three months."
"1566780","1569200"," I think it's a fair topic."
"1569480","1571260"," It's like you're you're selling. "
"1571940","1575480"," You're selling your selling puts and you're buying puts outside the money and inside the money."
"1575700","1576860"," They actually pay money."
"1577420","1580120"," They actually pay you money if the market continues to go up. "
"1580120","1581600"," We don't have a risk off event."
"1582080","1587860"," So add 10% of your your pile under there around 4,400 add some around 4,500 add some"
"1587860","1593300"," and take this market long as of right now as of right now there's rotation into our market."
"1595300","1596920"," So we're going to scroll through this real quick. "
"1597040","1597740"," We're going to be done with this."
"1598140","1599280"," We're already done with this."
"1599360","1604060"," We're going to look at this chart real quick here and we're going to look at some support right"
"1604060","1605840"," we're looking for some support off the ballot. "
"1606060","1608680"," 930 read this 4, 3, 3, 0, 0."
"1608680","1611520"," We can call it not 5, 9 probably down here a little bit."
"1611820","1612620"," Make it a minute."
"1612740","1613540"," Make it a little bit of. "
"1614340","1617960"," 4, 3, 2, 4, 3, 3, 0 and then we'll look for another bounce down below."
"1617960","1620860"," This is where I want to see 4,300 down here."
"1621100","1622900"," I'd even like to see a dip. "
"1623200","1624780"," I'd even like to see something like this."
"1624780","1626320"," We'll do a polyline here."
"1626760","1633240"," I'd really like to see something like like outside of a trading range maybe down here and then we"
"1633240","1633900"," take this higher. "
"1634380","1635620"," Something like that would be nice."
"1638860","1643200"," Another thing I'd like to see another option I'd like to see would be something like this."
"1643820","1645840"," We trade down below here, right?"
"1646380","1648860"," And we come up and there's a rejection here. "
"1649260","1650140"," Right if we get this rejection."
"1651460","1654200"," You'd see like one like two time failure, three time failure."
"1655380","1657080"," And then we start to head lower here. "
"1657540","1659360"," That's another nice trade down below here."
"1659820","1660160"," All right."
"1660280","1661580"," So that would be a nice trade down here. "
"1661900","1664700"," If you're super bullish there, you're like, hey, Cap, I'm super bullish."
"1665340","1666720"," The only thing you're looking for then is what?"
"1667100","1670040"," If you're bullish, you're going to look for a green bar up here, right?"
"1670220","1672940"," And a rejection, the rejection is going to start here, start here."
"1672940","1674700"," Let's say it gets as high as here. "
"1675000","1677180"," Then you're going to take your money and run somewhere up there, right?"
"1677300","1679260"," As it trades back down, right?"
"1679720","1681260"," So that would be the next option."
"1681600","1687940"," And then the last option would be that we trade, we trade something like this up here, right?"
"1688060","1689660"," And we get a rejection, you get a fake green bar."
"1689800","1691180"," That's one of the one of my favorites. "
"1691620","1694020"," You get the fake green bar off the bell, right?"
"1694400","1696040"," And we actually bounce down below here."
"1697860","1700140"," And then we actually take it up higher here."
"1700140","1703660"," So be aware of all these support and resistances today. "
"1703960","1709420"," Make sure that you know that if you're day trading this, that you are a reaction trader, right?"
"1709740","1711300"," We don't need to see the first move."
"1711520","1713860"," We just need to see what the reaction is."
"1713860","1715400"," And can we take it short then?"
"1715760","1717220"," Then can we take it long here?"
"1718820","1720880"," So we're going to want to remove this real quick. "
"1721660","1726240"," If you really want to know what I think happens, if you want to know what my take in is"
"1726240","1728240"," on today, it's going to be one of those two."
"1728240","1730080"," We're either going to green bar it up."
"1730360","1733780"," We start here and then we're going to reject down. "
"1734120","1737400"," I think eventually by Friday, we're going to wind up somewhere down in here."
"1737920","1738980"," That's what I think happens."
"1739420","1740500"," Something like this. "
"1741240","1746540"," If we don't do that, I think we're going to trade somewhere in this zone."
"1746960","1751400"," Now if we don't green bar it up and reject automatically after bell, if we start to trickle down"
"1751400","1755940"," here, I'm going to be looking for some support and then take along for another rejection above"
"1755940","1756280"," here."
"1756280","1760740"," There'll be some rejection at some point in this area above. "
"1761160","1762640"," I don't know if it's right off the bell."
"1762760","1767300"," I don't know if it's a bounce down below and then a rip higher for a rejection."
"1767840","1772680"," But if you want to take this short, this is a perfect zone for you to take this market short. "
"1772820","1774080"," You can wait for this to happen."
"1774460","1778120"," Or if we start to trickle off right off here, you take it long and then we'll take it short"
"1778120","1780180"," again down into Friday's close."
"1784540","1789140"," Paul is saying there's a gap at 417 down in here. "
"1789440","1790500"," I can see a straight lower."
"1790900","1793440"," I don't mind taking this down to 415, 417."
"1794340","1802960"," I don't even mind us trading this down to 4050 into the game and looking at different time frame"
"1802960","1803260"," here. "
"1804000","1806540"," If you want to see it, you want to see how nasty it can get."
"1808680","1810780"," You guys want to see where it can actually trade to."
"1810860","1812280"," This is the 31st down here. "
"1812720","1817340"," It's nothing for us to trade down to 400 to just trail this, hold on a second here."
"1817560","1823980"," There's nothing, nothing saying we can't have one more capitulation move down into the 31st way"
"1823980","1825300"," down in here, right?"
"1825560","1826720"," Just trade this right down."
"1827380","1830600"," But we do have puts rolling off where we are right now. "
"1830860","1836380"," The only thing you have to be concerned about here is if you watch real money selling or if you"
"1836380","1840900"," watch calls coming to the market, if you don't see calls from the market, if you start to see more"
"1840900","1847160"," hedging take place either here or if you see hedging taking place, if you're a futures trader, keep"
"1847160","1849780"," your eyes open on the futures market."
"1849820","1858240"," If they take the money, put options in the cash market and roll them into futures going short where"
"1858240","1866540"," they can short down the overnight all the way down into 400 down here, heading into the 31st."
"1866840","1869820"," This could be a whole rotation phase and then you end up getting fucked. "
"1869820","1871240"," You buy in too early as a bull."
"1871780","1877580"," When reality, the real buy is down here into April and June and the future."
"1878160","1879280"," I want to talk to you guys about something. "
"1879380","1881460"," We've got a few minutes left out there."
"1882420","1884220"," I want to talk to you guys about something."
"1885140","1887080"," Try to make this quick and simple here. "
"1891400","1893380"," Yesterday, I've got some other charts for you."
"1893380","1894600"," I've got some stock screeners."
"1894800","1897780"," As the day progresses here, I'm going to bring up some screeners for you. "
"1898060","1903060"," I'll show you some stocks as the day progresses that are down around there, 52-week lows, stuff"
"1903060","1908140"," that looks tempting to buy into for a long hold one to three months."
"1908520","1912580"," You don't necessarily have to buy this stuff down at 4050."
"1912920","1915620"," You don't necessarily have to be like, I have to wait for rock bottom cap. "
"1915620","1917820"," These are like one three month holds."
"1918680","1924100"," You can buy them soon this week on Friday next week into the 31st."
"1924380","1925900"," You can even buy them some of them now. "
"1926240","1932040"," Some of these stocks have not been participating in the sell-offs as aggressively as other stocks"
"1932040","1932440"," have."
"1932980","1934400"," We'll talk about that in a little bit."
"1934540","1936160"," Right now, I want to talk about yesterday's FOMC. "
"1938180","1938820"," It's weird."
"1939140","1941940"," I'm watching bears say some fucked up shit."
"1942160","1943960"," I'm watching bulls say some fucked up shit. "
"1944540","1950400"," None of them are making sense to me out there for either side of what their takeaway is from"
"1950400","1951480"," yesterday's FOMC."
"1951920","1954200"," Now, there are some fucking problems."
"1955040","1960960"," I don't like to bring up politics, but I think it's leading me to politics at some point. "
"1962600","1964700"," Now, there's two sides to this trade."
"1965720","1967380"," There's a bunch of stuff going on with this."
"1967640","1970820"," Number one, inflation is through the fucking roof. "
"1971560","1972740"," It is through the roof."
"1972740","1974780"," You can see it right here."
"1974820","1975580"," This is the Fred chart. "
"1976440","1978340"," You can see where we are currently."
"1978860","1986860"," Last time we were up in here was we drove up into here was way back in 1973."
"1987680","1988380"," We did it again. "
"1989300","1992060"," We did it again somewhere in 1978."
"1992540","1995920"," Roughly, roughly right here."
"1995920","1997400"," December, 1978. "
"1997600","1999620"," Look up a chart in December 1978."
"2000520","2003820"," What we actually did is to try to fight inflation back then."
"2006340","2008260"," I'm not going to mute this a little bit. "
"2010240","2015640"," I want to be keyed in on this because rates were high back then."
"2015940","2016620"," You had Volca, right?"
"2016780","2021960"," They had rates that were like 25 basis points, 30 basis points, 15 basis points."
"2022700","2024640"," There's a couple of problems that we had in here. "
"2025820","2028820"," First of all, we raised rates through the roof, right?"
"2029340","2035440"," When we started to see a steep decline in inflation, we also came into a recession."
"2036720","2040620"," There's a few other things though, but the tools that are being used right now are not potent"
"2040620","2042620"," enough to reverse inflation."
"2043560","2047739"," Yesterday, you've got J-POW saying we want to price control, right?"
"2047840","2049159"," We're trying to price control. "
"2049159","2051000"," They can't price control."
"2051480","2055900"," The way the rates are right now are not enough to price control."
"2056460","2061159"," The other issue that we have right now, of course, is war fairs, right?"
"2061540","2066420"," We have fears on war, on commodities, right?"
"2066719","2067540"," It's commodities scarcity. "
"2068280","2072639"," We also have people taking advantage of inflation right now when they shouldn't be."
"2073920","2079920"," And we have another issue here right now, which is the tools the Fed is using are not potent enough"
"2079920","2084679"," to stop runaway inflation or wage inflation as well, right?"
"2084940","2086080"," They're not the tools."
"2086760","2089940"," And furthermore, they didn't discuss QT yesterday. "
"2090780","2095780"," So like we talked about the top in the past, they're not going to start QT."
"2095920","2098200"," They, of course, QE has ended."
"2098500","2103040"," They've stopped their bond purchasing or the debt corporate debt purchasing, but they haven't begun"
"2103040","2104980"," to remove this money from the market. "
"2104980","2109160"," So no QT is bad to stop inflation over here."
"2109260","2113480"," Not that it really does or really doesn't, but they're not going to stop the inflation."
"2113820","2116300"," They're not going to stop it with the rates as low as they are. "
"2116480","2119400"," They're not going to stop it with QT not being implemented."
"2120000","2122620"," Even if that's another, yesterday he called it another Fed."
"2123140","2128600"," Another Fed rate raised in a way by introducing QT, but he hasn't done that. "
"2128880","2133080"," And then the timeframe that he took yesterday of saying, oh, this should go away."
"2133080","2135040"," We should have shortages should go away in nine months."
"2136480","2139640"," And inflation should start to go away in nine months in one year. "
"2140540","2141900"," In one fucking year."
"2142240","2148580"," And even if they did in one fucking year and we continue up here, if this chart continues up here"
"2148580","2154140"," on the right hand side, and let's say magically, right, you see that come down each time we've had"
"2154140","2154660"," that happen."
"2155120","2158940"," It's marked by a major recession, major recession. "
"2159540","2159940"," Okay."
"2159940","2165280"," So first of all, rather than spreading it out over, let's say two, three years, so that we have a,"
"2165280","2168840"," we've got a great market, let's say, for a couple more years, two, two, three years, he's saying,"
"2168980","2170600"," no, it's going to happen in nine months."
"2170920","2171300"," It's insane. "
"2171920","2172560"," It's never happening."
"2172880","2174940"," He's been wrong every single time and everything he said."
"2175380","2178000"," And in another fact, the Fed is like a skiff. "
"2178260","2180640"," They come through and like a hammer that hits a nail."
"2181400","2184660"," It's always too late by the time they slam the hammer down."
"2185100","2186400"," And here's where the real issue lies. "
"2186400","2191880"," More than likely we've got a Senate election coming up this fall, and we have a presidential"
"2191880","2192960"," election in 2024."
"2193760","2196660"," There's no way they're going to control these prices in a year, right?"
"2196900","2202420"," And furthermore, what they're going to do is my thought, or my thought process here is it"
"2202420","2204600"," ultimately leads to two things."
"2205060","2212500"," They're going to try to manage the rate of inflation, but extend it into, let's say, 2024,"
"2212540","2215260"," November, so that you can get in a letter. "
"2215440","2219640"," At least this is what the perspective of the current president is, right?"
"2220020","2225380"," You don't, you don't allow an actual recession to kick in or hit until after the election in 2024."
"2225960","2231640"," You manage inflation until then, and then they could, then they claim that they'll fight inflation"
"2231640","2233260"," after that next election."
"2233780","2236340"," So what you end up seeing is a couple of things happen. "
"2236500","2244960"," You'd see Main Street get poorer for the next, basically you'd have Main Street get fucked over."
"2245420","2247600"," You would also see inflation rise."
"2248140","2251700"," You would see the housing market do well for the next couple of years, believe it or not, because"
"2251700","2258320"," rates are so low, and you would end up seeing the stock market trade to stupid highs. "
"2259020","2262780"," Like you would, you would literally see our stock market trade, so you'd see probably test out like"
"2262780","2270400"," 2000 or something insane because of, because of inflation, because of the value of the dollar, and"
"2270400","2273900"," furthermore, you're only getting, no people getting fucked, they're going to deal with variable"
"2273900","2278800"," rate mortgages, people with credit cards available, variable rates, right, and credit cards."
"2279520","2282520"," You're not going to see as much of an impact in the use of the car market, but we already"
"2282520","2285920"," know that the car dealers are saying we're not going to increase inventory, right?"
"2286220","2287480"," We're going to create artificial shortages."
"2288220","2294520"," And the other issue is that people can't put money into savings accounts and make actual, for the,"
"2294520","2299060"," excuse me, for the increase in inflation, right?"
"2299780","2302800"," You won't be able to keep up by putting your money into savings account. "
"2303140","2307620"," So basically what they're telling you is you have to take risk on as a wealthy person."
"2307920","2315440"," You have to buy real estate and you have to invest in the stock market to be inflation, and"
"2315440","2318320"," inflation is going to run rampant during these two or three years."
"2318600","2321300"," So what are you going to do with your money, right?"
"2321560","2326460"," What are you going to do with your money so that it doesn't lose value over two, three years?"
"2326800","2333580"," So in my view right now is changing to, my view is changing to, and then the last option would"
"2333580","2339000"," be where you've got banks that are like, oh, we're going to be, we're going to be the market"
"2339000","2344320"," guardian and we're going to drop the market and we're going to drop the market down as rates"
"2344320","2347620"," increase over time and we're going to keep the market safe. "
"2348020","2349400"," I don't believe that for a fucking second."
"2349400","2354820"," I think the fucking banks are greedy fucking old greasy old men and they're going to take it,"
"2354820","2356300"," squeeze it for every dollar that they can."
"2356580","2359320"," I don't think that they're going to self-regulate the markets so they don't have another crash. "
"2359820","2364440"," I think that they're setting this market up to trade into a giant fucking bubble."
"2364980","2368800"," It's going to take two, three years, and then I think there's going to be a large crash at some"
"2368800","2370440"," point, two, three years down the road."
"2370580","2374420"," Now, with all that said that I'm just telling you here, right, you're going to see a moment like"
"2374420","2376140"," this in 1974. "
"2376140","2383620"," You're going to see another moment like this in 1978, something like this and inflation rage out of"
"2383620","2388340"," control because two points, three points, four points, five points, none of that helps."
"2388720","2389780"," QT doesn't help."
"2390000","2393180"," None of that's actually going to stop this runaway inflation. "
"2393320","2395700"," It probably is tied in my view to politics."
"2396380","2400940"," So you get elected, the economy is great, and then you get your last four years and hopefully that"
"2400940","2406800"," president, whoever that is, is going to then clamp down, pull a Volcker move and raise rates to the"
"2406800","2411360"," roof and literally slam us into a recessionary depression after the election is over."
"2411580","2412660"," That's what I think at this point. "
"2412840","2414360"," Now, I can be wrong on this."
"2414560","2419820"," I have a conference that I'm going to attend in the next day and I have to sit in and"
"2419820","2426820"," listen to these guys, these weirdo macro smart guys and what their viewpoint is if the banks are"
"2426820","2431860"," actually going to sell this market out or if the banks are actually going to attempt to do the"
"2431860","2437720"," right thing for the next couple of years and try to help tame in inflation, but I'm not buying it."
"2437940","2439940"," The way that he talked yesterday, right?"
"2440060","2441180"," I'm not fucking buying it. "
"2441580","2448100"," I'm trying to connect the dots here and it's weird because I'm hearing bears say, this is hawkish."
"2448600","2450280"," I'm hearing bull say, this is hawkish."
"2450680","2453700"," I'm hearing bull say, this is dovish. "
"2454180","2455660"," I'm hearing bears say, two dovish."
"2456060","2460400"," I'm hearing all these weirdness and cross-channel takes on where the market is."
"2460900","2464880"," To be honest, because of that, I'm in a weird place myself, but I got to tell you, right?"
"2465340","2471680"," I got to tell you, my instinct and gut feeling from the past is that it was super dovish. "
"2472140","2475400"," The Fed is going to fuck this market."
"2475840","2480980"," They're going to fuck Main Street and they're going to drive this market to all-time eyes, all-time"
"2480980","2481560"," eyes, bubble."
"2482140","2489340"," We are set up right now as of the talk yesterday to turn this market into a giant, giant bubble"
"2489340","2491160"," over the course of two years. "
"2491580","2496000"," I'm going to call it sometime late 2024, somewhere in there."
"2496100","2500840"," We're already in 2022, as we got, I don't know if it's two years, somewhere around 2024, you'll see"
"2500840","2506600"," us peak at an all-time, or not an all-time, but near and all-time high here, you'll see"
"2506600","2509300"," someone, I guess, see someone's talking the background, microwave and stuff."
"2511000","2513020"," So I want you guys to be aware of that. "
"2513140","2515960"," I'll know more information over the coming week."
"2516440","2522340"," I'll have a better grasp on the macro picture of where we're actually heading."
"2522720","2526400"," The one thing you can watch in the background are going to be the credit markets. "
"2526960","2533280"," If the credit markets, if junk bonds doesn't buy it, you start to see it in T&X, you start"
"2533280","2537020"," to see it in the 20-year, any of that kind of stuff, the bond market's going to tell you"
"2537020","2541640"," truly what's going on in the background, the underlying mechanics of the market market forward."
"2542120","2547980"," But even if we trade down a 405, right, even if we trade out a 405 onto the 31st, that"
"2547980","2551620"," doesn't mean shit in terms of us still trading into a bubble."
"2551980","2560000"," It's a small moment on a much larger chart and a much larger market mechanic that could send us to"
"2560000","2563820"," some stupid highs, to out of control, just wild. "
"2566570","2567170"," Wild."
"2568390","2569470"," Absolutely wild."
"2570690","2575670"," So if you're listening into that, we'll push this over here for you. "
"2576250","2576750"," Slide this over."
"2576910","2578090"," We'll miss some of your chat in there."
"2581190","2583870"," Yeah, I saw the QT schedule in May. "
"2584130","2584870"," I saw the discussion."
"2585430","2587370"," It's still talking about talking about."
"2587610","2591710"," It's still talking about talking about that it's still not high enough. "
"2591990","2596250"," You have to understand the rate of increase in inflation, right?"
"2596730","2599810"," The rate of increase where we are currently right now, right?"
"2600470","2602250"," Two percent, five percent."
"2602610","2605710"," The regime is not strong enough to fight this."
"2606290","2611210"," The shortages that we have are not strong enough to fight shortages. "
"2611830","2613030"," We're still seeing shortages."
"2613350","2617670"," And then furthermore, if you're looking out there, if you look, I got some other numbers I want to"
"2617670","2622230"," bring up for you later on, but I've got a bunch of other charts for you that show where people"
"2622230","2623990"," are spending their money out there."
"2624270","2629770"," You will see Main Street get fucked first and you will see rich people, wealthy people like me,"
"2630190","2635290"," that can't compete with inflation, have to put risk into the stock market. "
"2635710","2640150"," If I can't get it from a savings counter from bonds, I'm going to have to get it from real"
"2640150","2643310"," estate and I'm going to have to get it from the stock market."
"2644050","2647690"," So just be conscious of that as we move forward and we're going to switch over now."
"2647850","2652470"," We're at 924 and I'm going to bring up some stocks here in just a minute for you. "
"2653750","2659790"," Turn this off here and turn that fed off for you and bring this down here."
"2662050","2663050"," You know, let's see that."
"2665850","2667890"," I can hear you guys talking back when it's pretty wild. "
"2669050","2670370"," It's kind of making me giggle."
"2672790","2673310"," All right."
"2673430","2674410"," So we've got book map open. "
"2674550","2675450"," We've got the spy feed up."
"2675650","2681910"," We should have, if you guys want me to look up in the chat right now, now let me get"
"2681910","2683310"," a paper and pen here."
"2683890","2690110"," I don't know where pens are. "
"2690210","2692610"," I want to write down some stickers to look up for you guys."
"2701440","2702320"," Call on the interns."
"2702680","2707720"," I feel like I feel like the debt from the 1980s. "
"2708400","2710060"," It's like yelling from three rooms away."
"2711340","2712620"," You like Mikey?"
"2713200","2714340"," Mikey come down here."
"2715780","2727730"," Can you"
"2727730","2729030"," guys can still see me on camera?"
"2729210","2729510"," That's dope. "
"2730210","2731070"," So I'm still here."
"2748330","2749270"," Hey, winky face."
"2749470","2750050"," How are you doing brother?"
"2753210","2754410"," Good morning, winky face. "
"2754650","2754890"," How are you?"

"3413020","3422140"," Probably still trying to, the market is probably still trying to digest the implication from FOMC"
"3422140","3422500"," yesterday. "
"3422500","3430040"," It was a really weird take on FOMC yesterday."
"3430240","3433800"," I don't think that was the expectation from most participants."
"3435140","3436780"," What was going to take place here?"
"3436880","3438680"," Here indicator is green though or yellow. "
"3438940","3445440"," It was called yellow but it is positive currently at this moment at 4865 on the market."

"3494120","3495560"," Let me just a second."
"3511070","3512070"," All right."
"3521400","3526460"," Got some burn going on the options side of things puts are losing a little bit of value here. "
"3527660","3532700"," Looks like it's starting to look like we're getting a little bit of a bit into the market right off"
"3532700","3533520"," of the bell here."
"3535580","3538460"," Spy is trading higher after I've got two green bars."
"3538940","3541160"," Looking for a little bit of resistance above at 435. "
"3542340","3549420"," Let's call it 435.93. And we got a little bit currently right where we are right where we are"
"3549420","3550300"," right here at 434."
"3550640","3552380"," But only look, let's look at the higher here."
"3552880","3553940"," Let's look higher. "
"3555400","3563160"," Yeah, right up here, 435.50. And then let's see if we find some more resistance up in here, 437 "
"3563160","3567380",".75. And then the golden child above at 440."
"3576450","3577970"," We'll see if we get this rejection."
"3585460","3587360"," So you can bring 440 up here. "
"3587820","3589360"," A little bit of ice above here, 440."
"3589960","3598280"," A little bit more ice above here, 437.62. We have slightly more buyers than sellers currently in"
"3598280","3598640"," the market."
"3602530","3604630"," Hey, Mikey, good to see you. "
"3606950","3608150"," The balloon meme."
"3613680","3616820"," Fed talking about the balance to reduction starting May is no."
"3616940","3623940"," You know, the one thing I want to say about that, right, is they're still talking about talking"
"3623940","3624400"," about. "
"3624680","3626720"," They still haven't."
"3626720","3628580"," They still have not."
"3630280","3632000"," They still have not. "
"3637280","3639740"," They're like still talking balance reduction."
"3639800","3643140"," They're still talking QT, but they still haven't done it."
"3643500","3645060"," And it wasn't definitive. "
"3645420","3648320"," It's still that's one of the key things about."
"3649140","3656260"," It's one of the key things about the balance sheet is that you're not seeing."
"3657020","3658340"," The actual reduction. "
"3659020","3663880"," And so as long as they're talking about talking about it still makes the market bullish."
"3664400","3666220"," It still does, whether you like it or not."
"3667940","3670000"," They're not definitive on it. "
"3675300","3678380"," And so I'm not I'm not seeing it."
"3684020","3690700"," I'm not saying I'm not seeing the bearishness from that QT should have been should have been"
"3690700","3691020"," discussed."
"3695100","3695920"," Well, in here. "
"3702150","3702770"," All right."
"3702770","3705230"," So you got a little bit of a bump on the VIX this morning."
"3707840","3709000"," Keep an eye on the VIX. "
"3709180","3714280"," The VIX is starting to turn up slightly as as it comes online at this point."
"3732800","3736440"," It is nice to see some call expansion in this morning."
"3736660","3744160"," If you're just joining us, we added a live stream into the discord with options flow. "
"3744160","3747360"," So you can have the YouTube stream up and running."
"3747760","3752280"," And then you can also have a discord open to watch live options flow."
"3752500","3753440"," It's in one of the voice channels. "
"3753900","3755580"," I think it's the daily stock market chat."
"3755880","3756860"," You can go in there."
"3757000","3758980"," I can hear you guys talking in there right now as well. "
"3759320","3762600"," So if you guys are discussing topics that I can always listen to in the background."
"3763460","3769400"," If you don't have a link to the discord that I think your wife's boyfriend just posted one so you"
"3769400","3770060"," can pop in there."
"3770060","3774940"," Some great traders in there and they'll get you into the chat. "
"3775440","3778020"," So you can actually watch the flow as it comes in."
"3778400","3785200"," What I'm looking at right now on the on the flow is some decent expansion right now into April."
"3785420","3787560"," You're seeing some April calls come into the market. "
"3787840","3794160"," You should see more of this as we trade into OPEC's as we as we catch a bid into the"
"3794160","3794460"," market."
"3802300","3803220"," You can see F."
"3803260","3803380"," S."

"3836480","3837760"," Yeah, you know, double away."
"3837940","3840420"," That's the one thing is the one thing is that."
"3841000","3847620"," Is that duty was discussed, but it's been it's been discussed, been discussed, been discussed, been"
"3847620","3847840"," discussed. "
"3849700","3852160"," And there's no there's no insight."
"3852160","3853660"," There's no aggressiveness."
"3866050","3867970"," Yeah, there's there was nothing hawkish. "
"3868190","3871610"," It's weird to because bears bears all over social media are like."
"3872150","3873950"," Are like, you know, that wasn't bear."
"3874110","3877410"," It was it was a dovish fed and then you got bulls. "
"3877410","3882910"," I see saying it was a hawkish fed in some seeing the opposite discussion, depending on who you"
"3882910","3883390"," speak to."
"3892080","3893980"," Okay, yeah, there we go."
"3896060","3898160"," So look over that trade higher off the bell. "
"3899300","3902440"," We know that we've got some resistance higher from there."
"3902520","3908200"," We'll bring you back to the spot gamma levels and the levels that we have charted here."
"3908280","3912220"," If you're just joining us so you can see where resistance is. "
"3914100","3915260"," Let's see here."
"3916220","3917560"," Bring this one up for you."
"3917960","3920880"," Just so you can see we are trading higher, you should see some resistance. "
"3920880","3927480"," If you see where my cursor is somewhere at this 435 435 or 436 99."
"3927980","3931480"," And then again above at 4400 somewhere up in here."
"3932000","3932860"," Some up in here. "
"3932940","3933940"," You should see some resistance."
"3934780","3937380"," I'm going to be looking for from this point for."
"3939640","3942640"," This this bounce down below here. "
"3943080","3944200"," Let's see."
"3944340","3945620"," We see the change that here."
"3947740","3952360"," I'm going to change this to a better color here so you guys can see the trade. "
"3953240","3962190"," And this trade should this resistance should begin right here or slightly higher."
"3962630","3968870"," We could trade above here or even as high as 440 441 and then we'll take us short."
"3968870","3971250"," If you want to start adding puts here. "
"3972690","3978470"," If you want to start adding puts here and then get more aggressive as we can move this over here"
"3978470","3980730"," into Friday called something like this."
"3981390","3985510"," You could start to add to a position here or even higher in here."
"3985810","3992310"," Anywhere from here to this 441 or so start putting on puts and look for a short in the market"
"3992310","3995010"," somewhere in this zone as we trade higher here. "
"3997370","3998710"," Is this helping you guys?"
"4000530","4000970"," Yeah."
"4001030","4002310"," He was neither damaged nor hot kids."
"4002430","4003590"," He was exactly what he needed to be. "
"4003970","4005390"," I doubt that."
"4006390","4007350"," But that's okay."
"4008450","4009210"," I've heard that. "
"4009370","4010710"," I've heard that comment out there."
"4010930","4012250"," I've heard that from other people as well."
"4012590","4014050"," He was exactly what he needed to be. "
"4014350","4015230"," That's not really true."
"4015530","4020390"," If you look at the mechanic the underneath mechanics of our market."
"4021450","4023630"," It's not exactly what he needed to be. "
"4024030","4025410"," And I'm fine with that."
"4025470","4027490"," I'm not actually in the camp of."
"4027750","4035170"," I'm actually in the camp of we need to be aggressive with with rates. "
"4035210","4037190"," We need to be aggressive with QT."
"4037870","4043650"," But you have to be aware of the of what's the the internals of the market."
"4044110","4045910"," The internals of the economy. "
"4046850","4048430"," And be aware of."
"4049330","4051170"," What actions they're taking."
"4051750","4056090"," And the impact that it has on the market and the economy. "
"4056510","4061130"," And so if they don't do those things what how does that translate into our market."
"4061350","4064410"," In my view that means the market goes up drastically."
"4065270","4068130"," I think that we actually the market goes to forms bubble. "
"4068370","4068770"," I think we're going to."
"4069090","4069610"," I think the."
"4070010","4070570"," They won't. "
"4070710","4072370"," I think that it comes to the point where."
"4072990","4074050"," Down the road."
"4074310","4075710"," They're going to have to get so aggressive. "
"4077610","4079170"," That it'll be it'll be wild."
"4079330","4080570"," The aggressiveness."
"4080930","4081990"," You put it off. "
"4082130","4082910"," Put it off."
"4083270","4083770"," Put it off."
"4084910","4088790"," The aggression that will need to be made to tamper these things down. "
"4089970","4094650"," Will in turn create a recession or a or a market crash of some point."
"4094750","4095830"," But I don't think it's here right now."
"4096090","4099010"," I think that I think that it's now. "
"4099670","4103229"," It's in the bucks been passed at least at this point."
"4103729","4104529"," The bucks been passed."
"4105850","4109890"," And even if you got aggressive in nine months it's not going to matter at that point. "
"4110430","4113649"," So I think you're going to get runaway inflation and I think you're going to also see the market."
"4114770","4116529"," Go to all time highs."
"4117330","4119090"," As of right now just as of today. "
"4119550","4120510"," My view may change."
"4120750","4124109"," I have some more work that I have to do to figure out."
"4125450","4129490"," How bad this market sells up because up and leading up to this meeting. "
"4129490","4134430"," My viewpoint was that we could be in a bear market down to."
"4136290","4140750"," Like three mid 300s mid 200s somewhere in there over time."
"4141470","4146430"," Depending on how aggressive we get that we would hit and go into some sort of a slow down. "
"4146870","4150689"," In the economy and in our market lasting a year or two."
"4150689","4152189"," If they postpone it."
"4153189","4155790"," The natural thing to do would be to make the market rip. "
"4156410","4159050"," To all time highs and then probably a bubble at some point."
"4160490","4161630"," And we just postpone."
"4164370","4166870"," I don't know if that making sense with that right now. "
"4169350","4171770"," So there is my charting right there."
"4171810","4179029"," We'll see if this pans out here, here and here is what you're looking for to take some form of"
"4179029","4179410"," a short."
"4182500","4184180"," Somewhere in that vicinity. "
"4185880","4188100"," And I'm going to mute that charts."
"4188600","4190040"," We're going to meet that go back to."
"4190460","4192120"," We're going to go back to the. "
"4195020","4198660"," You see some resistance above here at 850 on Tesla."
"4200020","4201920"," Cumulative indicators slightly green."
"4202200","4206020"," This would today looks like to me what I'm looking at right now looks like rotation. "
"4206720","4210040"," Looks like banks are buying what they want to buy."
"4210800","4214320"," The focus is not in driving the market up per se."
"4215680","4219300"," And I, my expectation is going to be that from now into. "
"4220600","4222860"," At least Friday that you'll see."
"4223620","4230340"," The whole quad witching thing right you're going to see rotations in and out of stocks."
"4231040","4235520"," Heading into quad witching and setting up for the next quarter. "
"4241590","4243130"," Matter of fact, I should have left that."
"4243390","4244050"," I should have my chart."
"4244210","4247510"," I should have left up where I think it's going to roll where the market's going to roll over. "
"4248650","4249610"," Let me see if I can get this."
"4251690","4252710"," Yeah, you know it's weird."
"4255690","4256950"," I'm not getting the. "
"4262350","4263230"," Hang tight here."
"4281550","4286410"," I'm lucky that I didn't sign up for that for longer than a short amount of time."
"4286870","4288150"," Okay, so give me just a second here. "
"4288210","4289210"," I'm going to look some stuff up for you."
"4289770","4291450"," I'll bring a screener up here for you."
"4291450","4297340"," And we're going to look at some charts here. "
"4311590","4314650"," All right, first, first try to bring up for you."
"4315390","4316130"," Hold on here."
"4319170","4323150"," Okay, the first thing I want to take a look at is this is one of the stock screeners that"
"4323150","4323470"," I use. "
"4323630","4324630"," This is Finviz."
"4326410","4332490"," I've got it checked off for price above the 20 day simple moving average, right?"
"4333670","4336550"," The float short is over 5%."
"4337190","4340510"," And then price above the 50 day simple moving average. "
"4342270","4346990"," I've got the price above the 200 day simple moving average checked off here, right?"
"4347730","4349990"," The average volume is over 500,000."
"4350850","4356290"," The IPO date is within the last three years, right?"
"4356990","4363110"," And then the sales growth quarter over quarter is over 30%."
"4363110","4367850"," This is a key sales growth quarter over quarter over 30%. "
"4367850","4373110"," And this is I haven't been able to use this screener for some time."
"4374590","4380810"," We recently we've had a lot of conversation about catching knives and I've talked about why bother"
"4380810","4385830"," catching knives when you can look for companies that are growth companies, right?"
"4386750","4392250"," You can look for growth companies that opened that IPO within the last three years."
"4392910","4399110"," Why bother finding these growth companies that have bad news constantly, right?"
"4399110","4401990"," So you're looking for year over year growth. "
"4402610","4406690"," You're also going to look at these companies they want to show you and look to see."
"4408310","4416430"," Check their you want to be checking their last three guidances on their reports and see what their"
"4416430","4418350"," what their expectations are for future growth."
"4418910","4423090"," And then it's weird because recently I haven't had a lot of tickers show up. "
"4423470","4426550"," But I have had tickers show up this past week."
"4426550","4427950"," I've had a bunch of tickers show up."
"4427950","4432570"," So we're going to look at some of these tickers and see what they're doing here. "
"4433170","4436850"," So the five that have come up this week are GFS."
"4439070","4440690"," We'll look at GFS here."
"4440750","4447310"," You can see that there's been a consolidation phase and they just actually squeezed higher here to"
"4447310","4447630"," $70. "
"4448350","4453790"," So sometimes the tickers that come up in here are good companies to track."
"4453970","4455110"," Sometimes they've already made their moves."
"4455110","4457770"," We'll look at JXN right now. "
"4458150","4458910"," Here's another one."
"4458970","4461250"," This is another one that I keep my eye on JXN."
"4461670","4468150"," You can see this impulse move higher to $42.45. I'll be looking for a price target above of $50"
"4468150","4469330"," on JXN. "
"4469950","4471430"," So there's another good one for you."
"4473130","4474610"," We've got sweet green."
"4475250","4476570"," This one's already made its move. "
"4476710","4481410"," But you can see this beautiful trade down consolidation phase and then a trade higher to $40."
"4481410","4484350"," So it's probably got a little bit more room left."
"4484510","4487850"," There's some resistance above here between $40 and $45. "
"4488110","4491350"," But we'll check these out on book map here in just a few moments."
"4491370","4492810"," We'll check out each one of these tickers."
"4494070","4495490"," Maybe that EV go. "
"4496770","4499270"," A beautiful consolidation phase down here."
"4500210","4500890"," Nice rip higher."
"4501930","4505510"," Looks like we're making another move here on EV go as well. "
"4507890","4511010"," I actually want to watch this one very closely EV go."
"4512470","4516630"," And then we're going to look at our same kind of a deal, right?"
"4516770","4517430"," We sold down."
"4517910","4523550"," Had lots of buyers came down, consolidated down here at two bucks and have sprung higher to a high"
"4523550","4524250"," of $5. "
"4524950","4527050"," And now looking for another bounce down below."
"4527210","4531850"," So we'll take a look at all these tickers quickly on book map."
"4533850","4536630"," And these should rotate out, rotate in and out. "
"4537910","4542250"," These should rotate in and out every, every week."
"4542910","4546130"," You should see new new tickers come in every week or two."
"4546250","4550130"," I love how you can usually find one or two tickers to trade. "
"4550730","4557310"," And the best part about this, about this, this screener is, instead of catching knives, you're"
"4557310","4558630"," actually catching momentum."
"4559190","4561350"," And we've talked about this in the past."
"4561830","4568150"," Why bother catching a knife on some stock like Facebook that's falling and trying to time it when"
"4568150","4576410"," you can just jump directly into stock and find out where it's actually heading. "
"4576630","4576770"," Okay."
"4577270","4577970"," And where it's going."
"4578630","4580390"," So we'll look at GFS first. "
"4580410","4581730"," This is global foundries."
"4582410","4583350"," Give me a second here."
"4583750","4586370"," Now this one has already made a move higher. "
"4588890","4590290"," That's right boys and girls."
"4590910","4592410"," This one's already made its move higher."
"4592930","4594730"," It's coming into some resistance above. "
"4595430","4603510"," You can see though that the sellers here are not actually here until we reach $74.84. So look for"
"4603510","4611290"," a cell on $74.84 and $75.72. And let's look for below."
"4611530","4620150"," What you can do with this chart is you can look below here at $67.63. Down to $65 for"
"4620150","4620870"," some support."
"4621270","4623910"," Looks like some major support though down at $60. "
"4625070","4626210"," So keep your eyes."
"4626770","4628230"," Let's see if we can get this."
"4628490","4629270"," Hold on here. "
"4630450","4633030"," Let's see if we can hang tight here."
"4636250","4637390"," So real support."
"4637590","4638990"," Set an alert at $50. "
"4640310","4645490"," It's just set an alert on this ticker on GFS for $50."
"4645490","4649970"," And if you set an alert on your charting software, have them send you an alert."
"4650470","4651710"," If it never hits, it never hits. "
"4651910","4654950"," What we're going to do here, what we're going to do for the next week or two."
"4655870","4659550"," During this OPEC cycle, what we're going to do is we're going to look at some tickers every day."
"4660430","4664770"," And you're going to create a watch list on your own charting software. "
"4665310","4665770"," Get yourself."
"4666130","4667730"," I don't know what you guys trade without there."
"4667830","4668730"," I hope you're not trading with Robin. "
"4668870","4672290"," But even if you are, download some kind of a legit charting software."
"4672850","4673210"," Right?"
"4673430","4674410"," I'm going to show you guys something else."
"4674570","4674670"," Okay. "
"4675270","4677630"," So I'm going to bring up, I guess we're going to start at the beginning."
"4678210","4678910"," Some of you out there."
"4678910","4679090"," Okay. "
"4679290","4682250"," So this is the, this is the spy chart."
"4682450","4682530"," Okay."
"4682630","4683390"," See my cursor over here. "
"4683850","4686450"," And you see this support line that I have here."
"4687430","4688630"," This channel, right?"
"4688830","4689210"," This channel."
"4689790","4693410"," I can right click on this and I can create an alert. "
"4694210","4695870"," So that every time we touch this, right?"
"4696290","4698190"," See that says create an alert at 42780."
"4698750","4703910"," Every time we touch this, it's going to send me an email or a text and say, Hey, cap."
"4704310","4705530"," We're touching down here. "
"4705530","4713290"," So then I would pay attention again to the spy and be able to find out if it's something that"
"4713290","4713950"," I want to buy, right?"
"4715770","4717270"," I could send an alert down here."
"4717270","4717570"," Right?"
"4718710","4724030"," And if it touches down here today, tomorrow, next week, however long it takes, it doesn't matter."
"4724030","4724770"," Right?"
"4724930","4729670"," And if I set enough of these alerts and chart enough of these tickers out, if I chart enough of"
"4729670","4737530"," these tickers out, what happens is I can, what happens is I can, I'll do one right now. "
"4737590","4738310"," We'll do GFS."
"4739310","4740570"," So we'll do GFS."
"4743270","4745210"," So this thing is just rip and hire. "
"4746170","4746250"," Right?"
"4746450","4749210"," I already know that it's going to probably sell off somewhere above here."
"4749290","4749570"," It's 74."
"4749570","4751550"," It was at 74-7369. "
"4752430","4755830"," So I'm going to look for resistance at 7369."
"4757690","4758390"," Almost right."
"4758750","4760130"," It's going to make a nice short right here. "
"4760830","4761490"," Believe it or not."
"4762770","4764010"," This man actually make a nice."
"4764170","4764730"," Where's that?"
"4765510","4766530"," It's not 7369. "
"4766790","4768530"," It's 7575."
"4768830","4769850"," This is where the short is."
"4772050","4773330"," So $75, $75. "
"4774570","4775650"," There's a short here."
"4775890","4775910"," Okay?"
"4776070","4777370"," You could send an alert to short here."
"4778030","4780490"," Send an alert on your own charting software. "
"4781110","4784570"," And then I gave you another level down below to pay attention to, right?"
"4784710","4787610"," I said pay attention to what I say, $50."
"4788150","4796570"," Now it might bounce at $65, but I told you to pay attention or to pay attention to $250."
"4796870","4799170"," I know you're like, oh, it's never coming back down here again, Cap. "
"4799910","4807190"," $50, but if you were to create a list of, let's say, 200 tickers, 150 tickers, right?"
"4807190","4810190"," I got another one here at 6575."
"4811450","4812510"," I got another one here."
"4812650","4813210"," Hold on a second here. "
"4813210","4814190"," I got another list."
"4814970","4817550"," I got another one here at 7163."
"4823150","4823550"," 7163. "
"4825450","4825850"," Right."
"4826010","4826390"," There's one."
"4827170","4831250"," And then I'm going to do another one here at 7023. "
"4836770","4837750"," 23 right there."
"4838010","4841630"," And then I'm going to do another one here at 6561."
"4848670","4849330"," Right there. "
"4850150","4850270"," Right."
"4851390","4855350"," So I got all those set there, but the big one is down here, right down here, 50 bucks."
"4855510","4856790"," This is where the real money is, believe it or not. "
"4858130","4860610"," So this is where I'm going to look to buy this ticker."
"4860610","4863270"," This ticker has great future ahead of itself."
"4864050","4865550"," And it's got some resistance above here. "
"4865710","4875550"," So in the short term, just in the short term here, do your"
"4875550","4876230"," own due diligence."
"4880250","4882110"," Just do your own due diligence."
"4884650","4886130"," We'll look for that right there. "
"4887910","4890050"," And then I'm going to set a second one over here."
"4890550","4891210"," One more."
"4893170","4896370"," Because we know we can dip even lower. "
"4897310","4901890"," In reality, if you're a bull, you're going to set your alert right on this line right here."
"4902970","4905450"," And you're going to create an alert right down there."
"4905630","4905670"," Okay. "
"4906510","4908650"," You can change it from above or below."
"4909650","4912410"," Just do above and then it'll be price, right?"
"4913830","4915090"," And we'll save that."
"4916270","4918070"," So now I've got an alert set here. "
"4918290","4921410"," This will send an email to me saying, hey, Cap, we've traded down below."
"4921530","4922690"," You might want to take a look over here."
"4923230","4924330"," You may pick up another long here. "
"4924490","4924590"," Okay."
"4924730","4925430"," So that's GFS."
"4926410","4928290"," Next one we're going to look at is. "
"4933820","4934860"," So we got GFS."
"4936180","4938180"," Next we're going to look at is JXN."
"4954180","4954900"," JXN Financial. "
"4959820","4961040"," Let's have a look at this one next."
"4962880","4963960"," I think one looked bad on the other."
"4964060","4965420"," I think JXN actually looks great. "
"4966660","4969060"," I can't remember, but I think JXN looks unreal."
"4969600","4970920"," So we'll bring up JXN next."
"4975500","4978960"," You start, you start looking at these companies and then you don't really care what they're doing. "
"4978960","4982060"," You just care about the basic fundamentals on a company, right?"
"4982680","4987260"," You care about, I'm going to chart this one out for you right here."
"4987440","4989860"," Actually JXN looks fucking gorgeous, by the way."
"4990560","4991820"," It looks gorgeous. "
"4995360","4997560"," Man, it looks gorgeous."
"5002220","5003520"," JXN looks banging."
"5007540","5010700"," I'm saying the F-bombs like F-bomb this, F-bomb that. "
"5012800","5014120"," JXN looks like it's going to squeeze."
"5019660","5021200"," JXN definitely looks like it's going to squeeze."
"5022960","5025440"," I mean look at that green bar for today on JXN. "
"5025440","5029220"," Let's look at JXN."
"5029420","5031920"," We've got more sellers than buyers currently in JXN."
"5038200","5039700"," That squeeze candidate. "
"5042220","5043740"," Real quiet in here."
"5044580","5047480"," We've got 41 and 45."
"5050280","5054100"," I'm going to go back to the main display. "
"5054100","5056320"," You guys can see what that buy and sell is, right?"
"5057060","5058920"," I'm going to bring this up right here."
"5059620","5062080"," I'm going to show you the move here."
"5064560","5068080"," I'm going to show you this nice consolidation phase here. "
"5070080","5072400"," I'm going to draw another one down in here."
"5072800","5075780"," We know, going back to December, if you bought this, boom."
"5076640","5079820"," Sold off, bought this, boom, sold off, bought this, boom. "
"5080560","5082860"," This is number 3, 1, 2, and 3."
"5083540","5085660"," They're going to say, oh, this is a double-top cap."
"5086000","5086960"," This is no double-top."
"5087080","5088460"," This is consolidation in here. "
"5088860","5090020"," That's exactly what this is."
"5090260","5091780"," Let's look at this one year."
"5092300","5093460"," Let's look at the five year. "
"5094140","5095060"," Let's look at our one year."
"5096520","5098500"," Look at that gorgeous consolidation."
"5099560","5102380"," Push up higher consolidation consolidation. "
"5103240","5104100"," Where is it trying to go?"
"5104220","5106660"," It's trying to go to a higher price target, right?"
"5107720","5111380"," We said 45 was where resistance was on it."
"5112460","5113300"," Above here."
"5114300","5116920"," We'll look to see if this rejects or if it squeezes. "
"5117580","5123200"," Even if it doesn't hit, let's say it trades higher here and it starts to sell off."
"5124720","5127420"," Let's say it trades here and it's not able to squeeze higher."
"5128140","5129200"," It just starts to come down. "
"5129380","5130920"," We'll set an alert for right down here."
"5132800","5133840"," We'll just keep trading this."
"5134080","5134800"," This should be a winner. "
"5135640","5136680"," Absolute winner, right?"
"5136860","5138280"," You've got one, two, three."
"5138460","5139980"," Three times it's been a winner so far."
"5139980","5144300"," We'll set an alert on this bottom right hand side here and just create an alert. "
"5144980","5146880"," If it's above, we're just going to save it."
"5147160","5149560"," Now we've got an alert set for one, two, and three."
"5150180","5152900"," It gives us an alert for the next time that it comes back down here. "
"5155100","5155540"," JXN."
"5162000","5162360"," Squeaks."
"5162840","5164260"," SG looks like it's already done. "
"5165060","5166340"," We're looking at our next."
"5170340","5171620"," We'll look at our loop."
"5172980","5173800"," Look at that. "
"5174120","5175040"," Look at that beautiful."
"5177440","5178460"," Absolutely great."
"5179100","5181160"," $1.80, right?"
"5182780","5187760"," We can see that it's broken out of its consolidation phase, consolidated, it has moved up. "
"5191440","5191960"," Right?"
"5192520","5194300"," And we've got another one coming down over here."
"5194880","5195900"," We've got a high of $10."
"5195900","5197700"," Hold on here. "
"5197940","5200860"," I don't know what happened there, but I think it's got weird."
"5203340","5203820"," Nope."
"5204080","5205020"," I don't know what's going on here. "
"5206280","5207300"," Okay, is that working?"
"5209860","5210880"," It's really wonky."
"5211380","5212700"," Can't see how that's happening like that."
"5215780","5218800"," I don't know what's going on here. "
"5219980","5221560"," The chart doesn't like it."
"5225900","5227380"," Somewhere right there."
"5228380","5229520"," So what are you looking for here?"
"5229620","5233640"," You're looking for some kind of a rejection above, right?"
"5234640","5237480"," We'll give a price target above a 46949. "
"5238300","5242780"," More consolidation here, our break above, and then a straight shot north here."
"5244360","5247700"," So we'll look to see if this can break out from this channel."
"5248680","5250100"," And so we could take this now. "
"5250280","5257940"," It's at $3.80. You could probably take it to $4.75. We'll look at this one up on BookMap"
"5257940","5260260"," and see if this actually tells the truth or not."
"5262960","5266200"," The ticker is our, and you can do, don't do diligence."
"5266500","5267320"," Look, these companies up. "
"5268120","5270780"," Find out what they're, what they're, what they're talking about."
"5270780","5271700"," Their futures are."
"5272020","5273360"," I think what's going to happen here. "
"5273740","5276480"," We'll look to see if this actually pans out here."
"5278880","5279980"," We'll meet that."
"5280240","5281220"," We're on hour now. "
"5284860","5287660"," We've got more buyers than sellers currently an hour."
"5288180","5294880"," And we're looking for sellers above at 479, 474, and real sellers above at 542."
"5295820","5300380"," And that's just about, yeah, just above where that resistance plays out there. "
"5300380","5302300"," And then of course you're looking above."
"5302320","5304600"," Now you can see a new price target of $7."
"5305660","5308460"," So if you look back on that chart that I have here. "
"5310320","5313000"," And you can see the resistance is here, right?"
"5313640","5316220"," And then I put this up to 7, but it's lower."
"5316420","5317780"," It's 7 bucks even."
"5318920","5319680"," There you go. "
"5320580","5321720"," There's your next one right there."
"5321800","5322200"," Great play."
"5322540","5323280"," This is a great play. "
"5324140","5324760"," And good consolidation."
"5325700","5328180"," You're not chasing fucking falling knives, right?"
"5328180","5330840"," Not chasing falling knives."
"5331240","5333060"," You're looking for something that's moving. "
"5333420","5334660"," Something that has interest."
"5335360","5340600"," Why bother chasing a knife when you can just follow along with stocks that are on the move higher,"
"5340880","5340920"," right?"
"5341220","5341740"," These are both."
"5342040","5344200"," These are stocks with bullish context. "
"5346000","5347020"," Falling knives."
"5347840","5349640"," Falling stop changing falling knives."
"5351760","5354660"," We'll look at SG and EV go next. "
"5357200","5358540"," Let me see if I can mute this."
"5359000","5359320"," Hold on."
"5361360","5361760"," Okay. "
"5361840","5364660"," So we'll look at we're looking at EV go unsubscribe."
"5365760","5366460"," We'll look at SG."
"5370100","5370820"," Sweet green. "
"5371580","5372580"," And these change every week."
"5372800","5373120"," Every week."
"5373280","5375160"," Every week I've got companies that come up. "
"5375980","5378180"," So get f SG and then we're going to do."
"5379240","5380340"," I don't think we did EV go yet."
"5380500","5381240"," So we'll do EV go. "
"5384160","5384980"," Ev go."
"5388160","5389200"," Ev go."
"5389300","5390100"," You guys like EV, right?"
"5392720","5393760"," All right. "
"5394060","5396020"," So we are on EV go."
"5396400","5397180"," Take a look at it."
"5397400","5398540"," It's got more buyers and sellers. "
"5398800","5398940"," Shocker."
"5400900","5403880"," And we'll look up SG."
"5403880","5404240"," Look at SG. "
"5408880","5409440"," Banging."
"5411880","5413460"," So we'll look at SG now."
"5413700","5415580"," Look at this gorgeous consolidation down here. "
"5420300","5423200"," A dip below 2487 twice now."
"5423420","5426460"," One and two trade higher both times."
"5427100","5428420"," Here's another one traded higher again. "
"5431240","5433040"," We'll draw another one right here."
"5433820","5436280"," Get a nice little resistance point here."
"5436600","5438500"," Trading a little bit above its weight. "
"5439220","5441640"," So we'll look for where resistance could be."
"5442680","5445220"," And we know that it's traded above its first resistance."
"5446120","5448820"," We know that its next price target is probably somewhere higher. "
"5448980","5450620"," We get some trap buyers probably hiding up here."
"5453140","5457860"," And the last place for trap buyers is probably higher at 53."
"5459920","5462400"," And again, higher at 56. "
"5462880","5463860"," You get some guy back here."
"5464360","5468060"," Probably capitulated down to $21 and just sold his ass out of there."
"5468740","5470720"," Just sold his ass out of there. "
"5474340","5477180"," Look at that."
"5477420","5478100"," Just crushing."
"5478400","5478840"," Oh, wait a minute. "
"5478920","5480920"," We got the more of that weird chart and shit going on."
"5481300","5482500"," Because all these companies are new."
"5484720","5486500"," All these companies are new. "
"5486500","5487640"," They're gorgeous."
"5489080","5490100"," Just bam."
"5491820","5496680"," And then we're going to look on to spot camera real quick. "
"5496820","5497260"," This is SG."
"5498520","5501980"," We can see we've got resistance at $39.11 and $40."
"5503860","5505900"," So we will mark off. "
"5506320","5506820"," Hold on a second here."
"5506980","5507480"," We'll mark off."
"5509820","5513320"," $39.11. Some sneaky pizza up here. "
"5517260","5518420"," That's why I like."
"5526240","5527280"," Somewhere in here."
"5528160","5529120"," And let's look higher. "
"5530560","5533620"," See if we can actually see if we can actually trade it to $43 or $44."
"5534660","5538460"," Looks like it's $46.44. $46 is the real money."
"5543780","5544260"," $46. "
"5548680","5549720"," And boom."
"5550200","5550460"," Okay."
"5550820","5553620"," So I just added in these dotted lines here. "
"5553760","5557680"," This is where the resistance is showing up on spot gamma."
"5558120","5559760"," This is where I think resistance is."
"5560220","5561740"," It looks like it's a little bit lower, right?"
"5561960","5563120"," See a little bit lower resistance. "
"5564200","5565660"," You can mark this however you want."
"5568240","5571280"," We've got more buyers and sellers currently right now."
"5572640","5576420"," And we've got heavy resistance at $39.61 or so. "
"5576420","5577860"," Somewhere up in here."
"5578080","5578220"," So."
"5580400","5582440"," I'd like to see something like this. "
"5583780","5584220"," Right."
"5584460","5584840"," Come up here."
"5584920","5585640"," Trade rebounds. "
"5586520","5590100"," And then I'm going to look for a buy anywhere below this yellow line."
"5591220","5592160"," Anywhere below this line."
"5592320","5593120"," Anywhere down here. "
"5593580","5594380"," So we get a rejection."
"5595060","5598240"," And what we end up doing is we end up consolidating for the next move higher."
"5598280","5600960"," So set an alert on this one right here. "
"5601180","5604040"," $33.19. Doesn't mean you have to buy it here."
"5604440","5604640"," Right."
"5605100","5609780"," But if if if this ended up like capitulating move down for three seconds. "
"5610360","5612600"," Down like 30 bucks or something bounces off."
"5612860","5614260"," Buy that for your next move up."
"5614420","5615300"," You can see consolidation. "
"5615920","5617440"," You can see a strong move higher."
"5617980","5619180"," Why bother about catching knives?"
"5619400","5621560"," Why why why why we trying to catch something out there."
"5621760","5624960"," That's currently going down for consolidating. "
"5625200","5627460"," When you literally on its way up right now."
"5627640","5629360"," Okay, now this might have been the best pick for today."
"5629860","5631440"," There's a couple of better ones that we already went through. "
"5631900","5633780"," But next we're going to look at EV go."
"5633780","5637540"," And so we're going to look at EV go next."
"5639040","5643520"," So I don't understand why we're constantly fighting with catching knives. "
"5644200","5646160"," When you've got stocks here that are."
"5646900","5647820"," That are."
"5651660","5654300"," We've got stocks here that are have consolidated. "
"5655220","5656120"," And are pushing."
"5657080","5658020"," We just look at that right."
"5658020","5659080"," Trade it's 20. "
"5659760","5661820"," Sold off boom down to seven bucks."
"5662740","5664020"," Consolidation didn't even last."
"5664240","5666200"," They're like literally boom one quick bump. "
"5666860","5668520"," And it's on the move already."
"5670340","5673460"," How many times do you guys go out there and you're trying to catch some shit like this."
"5674000","5677060"," And just keeps trading down and down and down and down. "
"5677660","5680780"," And reality we've got stocks that are on the move there."
"5680920","5683260"," They're literally moving higher right now."
"5683600","5686520"," How do you trade stocks would be the next question. "
"5686520","5688000"," How do you trade a stock that's on the move higher."
"5688600","5690580"," Well you just set some sports right."
"5691360","5696620"," You set some classic lines like this and you make a you make a make a an alert here. "
"5697300","5697480"," Right."
"5697740","5698880"," And hopefully it comes back down."
"5699040","5700620"," Test one, two, three, four. "
"5701160","5701400"," Right."
"5701560","5703620"," You can see that we can even move this higher here."
"5704500","5707800"," And if one of these sets an alert off for you come back to it. "
"5707900","5711020"," Let's say you set like 200 of these alerts and all of a sudden."
"5711720","5714100"," You see the EV go is bounced here."
"5714100","5715040"," Right. "
"5715040","5715680"," Like a week."
"5716440","5717780"," And you get alert in the morning."
"5718120","5719040"," You're sipping your coffee. "
"5719220","5721720"," It's 4 a.m. And you're like, oh look, EV goes come down."
"5722180","5724040"," Let's find out if it's going to actually bounce here."
"5724380","5726940"," So I can take a long position to trade it higher. "
"5727360","5730560"," And EV goes first resistance is at $15."
"5732240","5732720"," $15."
"5734060","5736180"," Clear skies to 15 bucks. "
"5737260","5738640"," 15 bucks right now."
"5738860","5738920"," Boom."
"5739660","5741140"," That's actually where resistance is. "
"5741880","5744760"," And so I'm going to show that one to you right now."
"5746380","5748560"," And we've got double."
"5750320","5753000"," Double the buyers on EV go double. "
"5753660","5755940"," Look at the CD buyers versus the CBD sellers."
"5756740","5758320"," Your first resistance is higher."
"5761580","5767000"," You got a little bit of resistance here at 12.95. A little bit of resistance at 13.84. Major"
"5767000","5769740"," resistance at 14.89 above here. "
"5769740","5772920"," And you got buyers just waiting down below at 12 bucks."
"5774100","5775440"," Just buying it up."
"5775720","5778580"," Trying to rip through this resistance here above. "
"5779240","5780720"," So EV go like that trade as well."
"5781980","5783500"," We'll get back to the spy."
"5784300","5785460"," And we will look at. "
"5788080","5789080"," Back to the spy."
"5792200","5794320"," See that ricochet move on the spy."
"5795580","5796760"," You see that ricochet right here. "
"5797560","5798800"," Let's look at the spy real quick."
"5799100","5800860"," I don't know if you guys can see that."
"5803600","5805180"," Let's look at the chart on the spy. "
"5806720","5807780"," I meant, oopsie."
"5809620","5810680"," You guys see this?"
"5811020","5812040"," This chart right here?"
"5812120","5812760"," Let's look at the spy chart."
"5813020","5813780"," You guys see the spy chart?"
"5816920","5820140"," I don't know if you guys are able to see the, there's the other chart. "
"5820520","5823460"," I don't know if I recently, this is the EV go chart."
"5826020","5827860"," Let me see if I bring this EV go."
"5832320","5834120"," There's that EV go chart right there. "
"5834740","5836400"," This is the SG chart right here."
"5841280","5842680"," And it's going to spy."
"5856240","5857120"," Some consolidation. "
"5860380","5862920"," Nice little consolidation zone in the spy right here."
"5863000","5864260"," We'll see if the spy can trade higher."
"5865020","5873500"," Price target above is going to be 439.05. And 441.72. We'll see if spy can trade higher,"
"5873680","5875420"," consolidate and make a move higher here. "
"5887760","5890320"," Just keep an eye right here when you guys to see this right here."
"5890420","5894740"," You guys want to see a better context of what we're looking for here."
"5895140","5897360"," What's this descending line here?"
"5897480","5899160"," We'll look at this in a larger frame frame. "
"5907900","5909740"," It's not a larger time frame."
"5910560","5912600"," How far back does that little white line go?"
"5912680","5913260"," It's right up here."
"5914040","5915320"," Well, you guys see this right?"
"5915440","5915920"," See right here?"
"5916120","5916700"," Bam right. "

"5921160","5921600"," 45773."
"5921960","5925960"," This is the last hope for the book, for the bear. "
"5926600","5927940"," And where is it right now?"
"5928360","5929260"," Right up here."
"5930360","5930800"," Right."
"5931320","5933000"," This is exactly where we are. "
"5933300","5936400"," So we're right at the last point of resistance."
"5936400","5939940"," We should be breaking above this moment."
"5941740","5943620"," And that comes down to right here. "
"5944680","5948660"," So three months ago, if you go all the way back to early January."
"5950680","5956860"," This is the highest point that we've traded to in the descending channel."
"5957920","5960780"," On the spy, a move higher. "
"5961480","5964620"," And consolidation above is bullish."
"5964620","5967820"," Foolish on the market."
"5975560","5977480"," This is the last one, boys and girls. "
"5978200","5979140"," Can we get enough?"
"5979400","5980940"," Can we go higher here?"
"5981720","5983920"," Or do we reject off of this line right here?"
"5984040","5984360"," Big question."
"5984940","5987340"," If you're a bear, right?"
"5987600","5990440"," This is the time for you to be taking short, right?"
"5990440","5996420"," If you're a bull, this is the time for you to wait for the banks to make this happen for"
"5996420","5996660"," you."
"5997200","6002720"," If you're a bull here, right, what you should be doing at this moment is taking profit. "
"6004000","6005900"," I'm going to show you what you're looking for if you're a bull."
"6007580","6013180"," You're going to look for some kind of a move like this, right?"
"6014580","6017160"," So this move here is going to fuck you up if you're a bull."
"6017160","6022740"," But then you're going to be taking it long, taking this long here, right?"
"6022960","6028920"," But if you're buying options, I guess, or if you're going to pick up some options with the next"
"6028920","6031600"," trade here, you're not looking for a rejection here. "
"6031660","6034760"," You're looking for some kind of consolidation on the next leg higher."
"6035020","6041300"," If you're a bear, what you're looking for, of course, is you're not looking for a trade sideways"
"6041300","6041620"," here."
"6041740","6042940"," This means we're going up. "
"6042940","6048960"," You want to be seeing either a hard rejection, which we haven't seen yet, or you see you're looking"
"6048960","6054680"," for like a super hard rejection, or you're looking for something like this, right?"
"6056980","6059660"," Can't get up higher, and then we start selling down here."
"6060980","6061300"," Sorry."
"6061800","6062080"," Sorry. "
"6062820","6065940"," I'm going to get a program to draw on this shit for you."
"6066800","6072100"," So you're looking for some rejection here if you're a bear to take this lower at this point."
"6073680","6078700"," So this is a no-go zone for bulls at this point, and this is a no-go zone for"
"6078700","6081480"," bears until you start to see the rejection take place. "
"6083300","6091880"," You'd rather pick it up as it starts to roll over rather than you want to be looking for the"
"6091880","6095020"," roll over here rather than pick up the roll over."
"6096780","6100760"," Rather than grabbing short here, you just wait until it rolls down slightly, then you know that you"
"6100760","6101920"," get a confirmation."
"6102780","6110080"," Another good confirmation for if you're a bear, another good way to take short is you don't take it"
"6110080","6110320"," yet. "
"6110840","6112580"," You wait for the first sell off, right?"
"6113240","6113940"," You don't get in yet."
"6114500","6116560"," It'll come back up, right?"
"6117280","6119300"," It'll act like it's going to bounce, but it's not."
"6119960","6121920"," And this is where you'd actually take your short. "
"6122180","6125960"," You'd actually wait to take your short until this move over here."
"6126260","6127220"," You don't enter this."
"6127240","6128040"," You look wait for confirmation. "
"6128700","6134200"," If you want to be safe, you wait to pick it up here, and you'd actually take this move for"
"6134200","6134780"," the move lower."
"6138180","6139500"," Does that help any of you out there?"
"6139800","6141240"," I hope this is helping you guys out there."
"6141240","6148820"," I hope you'll be able to show a better representation of what's going on in the market currently. "
"6150000","6150780"," We know this helps."
"6152740","6155780"," Yeah, so Chase is asking a great question."
"6156240","6158700"," What does Bookmap say about this inflection point on spy?"
"6159300","6160520"," And you see it right now, right?"
"6160940","6163060"," We're looking at Bookmap right now. "
"6163880","6164600"," So what are you looking for?"
"6164680","6168380"," Are you looking for more questions to be answered?"
"6168380","6170520"," You can see that there are sellers above."
"6171100","6175760"," You can see down here, we have some absorption of sellers, though, in buyers versus sellers."
"6176340","6179240"," You can see that the options market is showing negative. "
"6179580","6183960"," My assumption would be with this is that you're seeing call holders taking profit."
"6184940","6190220"," And you're seeing call holders selling calls, right?"
"6191000","6192740"," And people buying puts here."
"6193520","6194440"," So what would you do?"
"6194600","6197100"," If you're a bull, you could take on some protection here. "
"6197620","6201540"," Even if you're going to take it long, you just add some put spreads in the money here."
"6201700","6205100"," Know that we're going to come back here at some point in the future, even if we trade higher."
"6205480","6206880"," So you probably see some put buying. "
"6207140","6210920"," That's what you're seeing with this here indicator is call selling and put buying."
"6211360","6214400"," You see the negative divergence already starting or beginning here."
"6214960","6217180"," You're seeing heavy resistance above, though. "
"6217580","6219900"," And you're seeing real money buying at the same time."
"6220440","6227900"," So let's look higher and see if there's more sellers above and you see them here at 440.09. So"
"6227900","6229940"," no, I'm not a bull here at this point."
"6230500","6233080"," I wouldn't be a bull until we trade up. "
"6233240","6236160"," We break through resistance above here."
"6236340","6238460"," Let's call it at 437.80 or so."
"6239780","6243540"," Possibly even as high as 440 and then take the next like higher. "
"6244560","6246700"," This is where you want to be sure somewhere in here."
"6252300","6253880"," Is this helping you guys out there?"
"6254580","6264500"," Is it helping bouncing back and forth between the charts and the charts and the book"
"6264500","6264700"," map?"
"6281140","6283320"," Yeah, so I've got some puts."
"6283680","6288600"," I've got four twenties for March 18. "
"6289400","6291240"," They cost me 22 cents."
"6293140","6296600"," So I've got some I've got some puts to 420 believe it or not."
"6297000","6299660"," Way down here right here. "
"6299740","6300640"," Oh, I can't even show you guys."
"6301460","6303340"," So I'll show you guys right now."
"6305500","6307240"," So I'm on this chart right here. "
"6307720","6309880"," I've got some puts."
"6311860","6314040"," So what I'll do is I have puts here."
"6314220","6316200"," I will cut them loose anything above 440. "
"6316200","6321000"," And my price target is."
"6321940","6326100"," Come on here."
"6326760","6328360"," No, take it. "
"6329200","6330020"," God damn."
"6330840","6332120"," Hold on here."
"6333340","6335660"," You guys want to know what my price target is. "
"6339580","6341300"," Right here."
"6343520","6344400"," So 420."
"6344940","6345700"," That's my price target. "
"6349480","6352480"," So the letter."
"6353100","6355200"," I don't know what's going on with this computer today."
"6356840","6358200"," So that's my price target. "
"6360180","6361200"," I've entered some puts."
"6361400","6363800"," What I'll do is I'll average into them as we trade higher."
"6364460","6367920"," If they go down like 10 cents, 15 cents somewhere up in here, I'll grab more. "
"6369100","6370560"," And they're dirt cheap right now."
"6370680","6371580"," They're pennies, right?"
"6371740","6373080"," 20 cents for puts down here."
"6374280","6375120"," No problems. "
"6376820","6377660"," No problems."
"6377920","6380680"," And if we trade higher than right here, let's say, let's say like, Oh, cap."
"6380920","6381700"," I'm not bearish at all. "
"6383460","6383880"," Right."
"6383940","6387860"," If we trade higher from here, I spent that 20 cents, 15 cents, 10 cents."
"6388100","6393380"," I'll pick up some calls to go higher to go higher into Friday up here. "
"6393780","6395760"," But so from right in here, I've got puts."
"6396740","6397580"," Four twenties."
"6398080","6401660"," You can see my projection from now into Friday clothes. "
"6404660","6405500"," Is that helping?"
"6405920","6407160"," I'm hoping if this helps."
"6408180","6409520"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"6411020","6417140"," So you guys see now what my, what my thought process is on taking a short here. "
"6417460","6422560"," And you know, if, if I burn 20 cents, if I burn 15 cents and 10 cents, and some of"
"6422560","6425300"," them up in, up in here, let's say I burn like that."
"6425440","6426460"," It's not a lot of money."
"6426640","6429480"," It's small and the payoff is huge. "
"6430320","6430660"," What do I care?"
"6431380","6431420"," Right?"
"6431660","6432640"," I've already taken this long."
"6433980","6435700"," I've already made the money on the long side here."
"6435980","6437380"," So this is nothing. "
"6438160","6441000"," And if we trade higher here, I'll pick up a, I'll pick up a long here."
"6441320","6441660"," No problem."
"6441860","6443460"," I can pick up a long above four forty. "
"6444180","6448640"," If we start trading and holding above four forty, I'll pick up some longs here and pay the money"
"6448640","6451820"," for the long, the expensive calls to go trade this higher."
"6452660","6456300"," But somewhere in here, right?"
"6456520","6461140"," Even if it trades to here, I can add more puts here and just, and just short this down into,"
"6461140","6463240"," into Friday's OPEC's."
"6463620","6468980"," Which I'm assuming we've got some, my assumption is that we've got a shit ton of call. "
"6469120","6469540"," Well, not assumption."
"6469800","6471080"," I've already looked at the, at the gamma."
"6471400","6477480"," We've got a ton of calls up here that they don't want to expire in the money on Friday. "
"6477480","6483320"," So my assumption is we trade lower somewhere between, you know, here, here and here."
"6483720","6485820"," So I'm going to scale into a short position."
"6486800","6490340"," Well, actually long puts the scale into it currently right here. "
"6490640","6492960"," I'm going to add some more right here and I'm going to add some more right here."
"6493780","6493840"," Right?"
"6493960","6497220"," It doesn't matter if it doesn't matter if it takes us all day to get here."
"6497680","6499420"," It doesn't matter if it takes us to end of day to get here. "
"6499520","6501120"," It doesn't matter if it takes us to get right here."
"6501520","6505340"," Either way, I'm taking a short on the market in here."
"6506240","6507020"," All right. "
"6507320","6508080"," So that helps."
"6509660","6519340"," And we're going to switch back over to off the charts and back to the book map here."
"6521220","6524720"," And we'll see if this market starts to roll over or not. "
"6525660","6528220"," And even if it fakes out, I'm going to be calm here."
"6528660","6529880"," Just keep adding to my position."
"6531140","6533840"," And we'll see how this market rolls over here. "
"6536740","6539060"," Also pay attention to the VIX."
"6539420","6540500"," Let's take a look at the VIX here."
"6541560","6543160"," We're going to bring up the VIX real quick. "
"6545440","6546040"," Do that."
"6546160","6547720"," Love having all this shit going on here."
"6548420","6554080"," You guys get to see, you guys get to see what the options flow is currently in the market. "
"6558940","6563820"," We're going to look at the VIX baby VIX."
"6571020","6572640"," How does cap trade?"
"6573320","6575540"," It's hard sometimes just showing you guys book map."
"6581260","6585300"," It's hard showing you guys just book map sometimes. "
"6600860","6601500"," All right."
"6601700","6603620"," So let's take a look at the VIX here."
"6612100","6613980"," And we're going to get back to the charts here. "
"6614680","6619620"," And we're going to look at the VIX real quick and see if we can see in the past."
"6619680","6622520"," We've had some support back here on February 17."
"6622520","6625580"," We've had some port back here on February 25, right?"
"6626700","6630140"," And we traded higher rejection, rejected, rejected, right?"
"6630360","6633240"," Trade it back down, rejected, and we're trading back down here. "
"6633360","6635560"," We've got some pretty decent support traded here in the past."
"6636280","6639160"," We've got some of this blue line down here."
"6639700","6642540"," It would be one that I'd be looking for without a doubt to be buying. "
"6642820","6644140"," Well, it's shorting the market, right?"
"6644940","6650000"," So my trading plan right now is that we bought them."
"6650000","6652600"," And maybe we come up here."
"6653140","6655480"," And then we find some rejection above. "
"6655920","6657200"," And then we trade down here."
"6657380","6659320"," Hold on there."
"6661020","6663780"," Or that we trade even higher here in the Friday, right?"
"6664020","6666720"," So you see this trade higher on the VIX into Friday. "
"6668860","6673020"," And then let's say Monday, it actually starts to fall off."
"6674260","6675520"," And what do we do?"
"6675700","6677560"," We end up buying the clothes on Friday."
"6677560","6680900"," We see the VIX fall off from Friday into Monday. "
"6681820","6685820"," And from now into Friday, we actually see the VIX make a move higher."
"6687160","6688220"," So that's my VIX."
"6688300","6689580"," That's my thoughts on the VIX. "
"6689680","6694200"," Now, if you're a bull and you're like, hell no cap, we're going higher."
"6694520","6695660"," I can see that trade too, right?"
"6695860","6696500"," Here's the VIX."
"6697380","6707360"," If the VIX ends up trading down into, let's say down here for Friday. "
"6708980","6713220"," The next question you would have would be, are you saying that we're going to keep trading up on"
"6713220","6713580"," Monday?"
"6713880","6714900"," It's possible, I guess."
"6715060","6717480"," I guess you could have a VANA trade that just keeps going on and on."
"6717920","6720740"," But you have this stupid melt up that takes us to 450. "
"6721260","6722200"," I can see that happening."
"6724440","6729040"," I'm going to buy the 20 cent cheat puts there and trade against that."
"6729840","6732920"," That we actually consolidate somewhere in here. "
"6733940","6738060"," And that this consolidation actually leads to a move higher."
"6739100","6741440"," This right here, this move here is a consolidation."
"6742340","6745260"," And that we actually trade this higher unless we get some headline news or something that I don't"
"6745260","6745640"," know about. "
"6758680","6764340"," So starting to think about, starting to think about thinking about what's actually happening."
"6764700","6766920"," A little bit of a roll over currently in the spy right now."
"6767280","6769520"," You see the roll over taking place in the spy. "
"6770900","6774540"," Oh, yeah, my puts are making money."
"6774720","6778400"," Not a lot of money, but they're up to 26 cents."
"6779100","6782120"," So I called that one out to you just a few minutes ago, right?"
"6782480","6783120"," It's not a lot. "
"6783320","6789460"," I mean, it's fucking 10% or 10% in a trade."
"6789640","6790020"," But look at that."
"6790240","6791540"," Your live stream is paid a little bit. "
"6795540","6796600"," Probably lose it all."
"6796600","6798180"," I'm probably going to add in some."
"6798500","6799700"," It's a good point that you're making. "
"6799700","6804920"," I'm probably going to add in some moving averages here and."
"6806760","6807600"," And see."
"6810880","6813020"," I'm going to give me just a second here. "
"6821660","6823180"," I'm going to get rid of that."
"6823480","6828200"," I'm going to get rid of the 20, the 50 and the 200."
"6839100","6843080"," Think tight here, I got to work on 20, 21. "
"6846020","6846460"," 50."
"6847960","6849420"," I'm going to create a moving average on this computer."
"6849700","6850220"," I got a new computer. "
"6853940","6855460"," 100."
"6857540","6859060"," 200."
"6860200","6860620"," Done. "
"6874420","6876020"," Just a second here."
"6882720","6883200"," 7."
"6885480","6885960"," 41."
"6888260","6888740"," 50. "
"6891500","6891980"," 100."
"6893140","6894520"," And then I'm going to skip the 150."
"6896480","6897620"," I guess I could do that. "
"6898740","6899000"," 200."
"6899960","6901080"," I'm going to put the 150 in there."
"6908600","6938540"," I'm"
"6938540","6938580"," not going to be looking for a bounce here on 434. "
"6969950","6970150"," I'm not going to be looking for a bounce here."
"6970150","6970230"," I'm not going to be looking for a bounce here."
"6970230","6970310"," I'm not going to be looking for a bounce here. "
"6970310","6970570"," I'm not going to be looking for a bounce here."
"6970610","6970770"," I'm not going to be looking for a bounce here."
"6972770","6976590"," I'm not going to be looking for a bounce. "
"6976590","6980270"," I'm not going to be looking for a bounce here."
"6993830","7000670"," I'm not going to be looking for a bounce."
"7004830","7006470"," Let's see. "
"7030670","7060050"," You"
"7064470","7072630"," See All right, there we"
"7072630","7075210"," go."
"7075210","7089810"," Oh, yeah,"
"7089950","7090030"," baby."
"7090270","7090730"," There's that role. "
"7092730","7093750"," Where's the yellow?"
"7094810","7096150"," Just a second here."
"7102710","7103530"," All right."
"7105230","7106190"," There we go. "
"7109750","7111770"," All right, sorry, I'm back again."
"7112850","7114910"," I had to build a, uh, the fed is always projected."
"7115250","7121930"," All right, maybe we guys are staying inside the side of the, uh, lawn here. "
"7128090","7128450"," Okay."
"7134690","7136530"," Some weirdness going on in the chat here."
"7141320","7142180"," All right, good. "
"7142400","7142820"," Hey, Cody."
"7142920","7143480"," Good to see you."
"7144060","7145020"," I hope you're doing well out there. "
"7146220","7147700"," Uh, thinking about thinking about IWM."
"7148220","7148240"," Yeah."
"7148360","7155240"," If you're looking for a bounce trade here on the market, I don't know if it's current. "
"7155420","7156440"," Well, let's get the Spyro quick."
"7156560","7156660"," Sorry."
"7156660","7157860"," I was paying attention to something else. "
"7159700","7161500"," I'm like looking for the bounce fade too."
"7164320","7169340"," Sorry, I was, I was working on a, uh, let's take a look here and see where real support is"
"7169340","7170760"," on the market."
"7174280","7177980"," Watching a lot of negative flow coming to the market currently, just to heads up on that. "
"7182600","7186780"," Watching, watching puts come in on Tesla."
"7187880","7189960"," March 18th, eight 30 P."
"7191300","7192700"," 26,000 dollars."
"7193220","7195440"," CDS puts AMD puts I N T C puts. "
"7196780","7200140"," American Airlines puts small money per part of that."
"7200140","7202460"," There's a big money on, on calls."
"7203680","7206100"," Just looking for some weakness, I think in the market. "
"7207020","7208960"," Uh, so that's the question."
"7209100","7209880"," We're going to roll over here."
"7209960","7210840"," We're not going to roll over here. "
"7211160","7213760"," Uh, hero indicators turning up though on the spy."
"7214040","7214800"," So be aware of that."
"7214880","7219320"," If you look down the bottom of your screen, you will see here indicators been turning up since"
"7219320","7224140"," what, um, since nine 40. "
"7224620","7226720"," So it's currently a 10 41, right?"
"7226720","7231820"," Now we're rolling over here, but you're seeing the hero indicators show green here."
"7232240","7237660"," So when you see a divergence like this where we're trading higher yesterday, I posted a divergence"
"7237660","7240520"," in the hero indicator."
"7241240","7242080"," Let me see here. "
"7242620","7245800"," I think yesterday, let me look at this."
"7245940","7246980"," Let me look at this real quick here."
"7248360","7249720"," You close this up. "
"7250860","7253820"," You guys can, you guys, I'll show you guys this right here yesterday."
"7257920","7262880"," Yesterday yesterday in Twitter, I posted, see my cursor yesterday in Twitter."
"7263160","7263720"," We were right here. "
"7264120","7267420"," I posted, see my cursor right there."
"7267580","7272800"," I posted yesterday and I said, Hey, there's a divergence in the hero indicator, even though it's"
"7272800","7274060"," showing that we're going up."
"7274600","7277600"," I said there is a divergence that we're trading down. "
"7278180","7282140"," You should have taken this trade yesterday and made fucking bank."
"7283420","7285040"," Fucking bank down here yesterday."
"7286600","7289580"," And so right now we're selling off in the market. "
"7289780","7289980"," Okay."
"7290940","7293780"," So it looks ugly where we are right now, right?"
"7293920","7298300"," This looks ugly on this chart, but I'm going to bring you back to, I'm going to bring it back"
"7298300","7299440"," to the hero indicator."
"7299620","7300080"," Okay. "
"7300700","7307040"," And the hero indicator is telling a slightly different story where we are currently."
"7307240","7310860"," So we're going to just take a look here and want you to see right there."
"7310860","7312840"," It was back to 930. "
"7313080","7318080"," So the past hour calls are coming in right now as we're selling off."
"7318900","7319260"," Right."
"7319640","7320880"," So what does that mean?"
"7321480","7328140"," It means that currently, right, we're not exactly selling this market just yet. "
"7328440","7334400"," You're looking at some dip buyers, some consolidation going on here."
"7334400","7336240"," And you see this yellow line."
"7336380","7340840"," You want to see this hero cumulative break below this red line. "
"7340840","7342940"," Below this CVD sellers."
"7343300","7344740"," See this CVD sellers?"
"7344960","7350920"," You want to see this hero indicator break below to start getting uber, super, duper bearish because"
"7350920","7356020"," otherwise what's happening is you're looking and it's starting to break through right now."
"7356020","7361720"," You can actually see the sellers overcome the buyers on the spy. "
"7361900","7362800"," I'm still short right now."
"7362960","7368920"," Just as heads up from now up to 27 cents on those, on those puts."
"7368920","7372580"," They were 22 cents, I think, when we bought them, right?"
"7372880","7374600"," So we're almost at 50% right now. "
"7375180","7380000"," Watching some buyers step in currently where we are trying to maintain on the spy right now."
"7380460","7383580"," So that you're going to say, hey, that's a bull flag cap."
"7383780","7387000"," And this looks like a bull flag because we have divergence going up. "
"7387460","7393340"," So you want to be paying attention to this and see if this hero indicator can continue to be moving"
"7393340","7398900"," higher, even if we're selling off to protect yourself in case it is an actual bull flag."
"7398900","7401240"," Just consolidation for the next move higher."
"7401640","7408420"," Or if the heretic here turns down and it makes us that trade lower at this point, right?"
"7408860","7413500"," So let's look back real quick on the on the on the candlestick chart. "
"7413500","7416400"," You saw resistance above here at 437 23."
"7416860","7419340"," You're seeing this consolidation in here."
"7419540","7426660"," And the question becomes, do we trade even if it's just down down here, right?"
"7426660","7427040"," Boom. "
"7427460","7428940"," And then we make the move higher here."
"7429240","7430020"," So that's the question, right?"
"7430160","7431380"," Do we trade down there?"
"7431760","7433660"," Do we not trade down there or not?"
"7434000","7437640"," Currently, is the trade even bigger heading into Friday down over here?"
"7437980","7440380"," Is the trade actually funnier?"
"7441160","7442040"," Am I doing here?"
"7443220","7443240"," Weird."
"7444900","7446360"," What is going on here?"
"7446460","7447620"," I got some weirdness going on here. "
"7449880","7451020"," Why is that happening?"
"7451940","7452300"," Hold on here."
"7454000","7455320"," That's some weirdness going on."
"7455620","7455800"," Okay. "
"7456420","7461600"," So as I trade just down to here, is it just to find more support for the next move leg"
"7461600","7461960"," higher?"
"7462560","7466180"," Is it something that trades all the way down into this Friday close here?"
"7467140","7469500"," Or is it going to slingshot higher?"
"7469720","7471540"," Is it just the consolidation phase?"
"7472300","7473200"," I guess this is the question."
"7475920","7476400"," Right."
"7476540","7479460"," Is this just the consolidation phase for the next leg up?"
"7480060","7483000"," You can also look for some support down here, currently where we are. "
"7483640","7485500"," So right now I'm still short this market."
"7486860","7489200"," I'll keep adding to it if I need to as we go higher."
"7492380","7495920"," I don't know what the fuck is going on with my charting software. "
"7496760","7498120"," This is bullish, right?"
"7498580","7500680"," You can see that it's bullish, but this is the move."
"7500920","7503020"," You see the move sideways trade, right?"
"7503240","7504380"," Think you're going higher and then boom."
"7504520","7505780"," We trade down, find some support. "
"7506140","7508760"," Boom, trade down, find some support for the next move higher."
"7508760","7510780"," Do we trade higher right now?"
"7511380","7512520"," I don't know."
"7512720","7515380"," You know, I'm watching SQQ puts come in right now. "
"7515740","7518840"," I'm watching racks and racks of SQQ calls come in."
"7519200","7523520"," They get a high algo score if you're watching inside of the, if you're watching inside of the"
"7523520","7531260"," discord, just saw one, two, three, four racks of SQQ calls"
"7531260","7539560"," March 18, 42C for a grand total of $400,000"
"7539560","7542160"," against tech."
"7549480","7551840"," Happy St. Patrick's Day, Paul, my brother. "
"7552060","7553200"," I hope you're doing well out there."
"7555500","7556740"," Hope you're doing well out there."
"7556900","7557940"," Happy St. Patrick's Day, my brother. "
"7558140","7561360"," My family is from Ireland."
"7561820","7563620"," Okay, so I'm going to take a quick break here."
"7564020","7565300"," I'm going to leave you on. "
"7565780","7567120"," I'm going to leave you on."
"7568120","7569560"," I'm going to leave you on."
"7570980","7572360"," Spot gamma right now. "
"7573860","7576200"," And you guys can watch spot gamma here."
"7577640","7579860"," I'm going to take a quick break, like five minute break."
"7579860","7583120"," Keep your eye on this here indicator because there is some divergence right now. "
"7584200","7588020"," We are rolling over slightly in the market, whether you want to admit that or not."
"7588020","7589940"," I don't care what spot gamma is saying."
"7590280","7591160"," I'll be honest with you. "
"7591480","7594020"," The offense spot gamma."
"7594400","7595360"," We could be trading higher."
"7595920","7599320"," And I saw some TQQ puts earlier about right now currently. "
"7600060","7602440"," There's still divergence in their own hero indicator."
"7603140","7604620"," I expect us to roll over."
"7605900","7611860"," I will attempt to take some profit down here at 431 and then maybe re-enter a short as we"
"7611860","7612200"," move forward. "
"7612200","7613040"," I just need five minutes."
"7613160","7616160"," I'm going to go take a piss and grab a cup of coffee."
"7616440","7617320"," My coffee is cold. "
"7620000","7620980"," I'll be right back."
"7623440","7626920"," Yet in my family is from Galway and Enish Gill."
"7628360","7629460"," And where else?"
"7629860","7630680"," Galway and Enish Gill. "
"7630800","7634180"," My fact, I'm only first generation in this country."
"7634740","7638400"," My grandparents lineages from Ireland."
"7638400","7642960"," I hope you're doing well, Paul. "
"7649320","7651280"," Oh, yeah, there you print me some puts, baby."
"7651740","7653400"," Print me some fucking puts."
"7654620","7655800"," I can't go anywhere. "
"7656040","7657160"," I got to see if these things print."
"7657880","7658700"," Give me some money."
"7659980","7661760"," There goes a print on some puts coming in. "
"7661920","7663100"," We're making some money on some puts."
"7666840","7669140"," We're making some money on some puts right now."
"7675500","7677360"," We're making some money on some puts. "
"7678080","7678560"," Yay."
"7679840","7681320"," I need a new mountain bike."
"7682720","7684240"," I'm about to order a new mountain bike. "
"7684420","7685020"," Print me some puts."
"7688960","7691000"," Print me some puts, baby."
"7692840","7693840"," Put print them. "
"7699240","7700620"," Print me some puts."
"7703140","7704920"," That was the call from this morning."
"7705040","7706240"," I hope you guys are making money out there. "
"7706360","7707520"," Burr, baby, burr, baby."
"7708500","7709580"," I love Galway."
"7713500","7714700"," Oh, yeah, so there's a question. "
"7716820","7717900"," Good question, Cody."
"7718740","7721780"," I'm just going to try a different news service."
"7722160","7723340"," I just bought a different news. "
"7723880","7725740"," I'm going to fight with Trade the News."
"7726200","7728080"," I'll get them back on here again, I promise."
"7729680","7736160"," If I'm going to go to Ben Zinga Charlie, I think at this point and try him out one more"
"7736160","7736340"," time. "
"7736700","7739120"," I'm going to make the rounds here because I'm a little pissed off."
"7739820","7740740"," Currently I trade the news."
"7740880","7743580"," I'm going to fight with one of their workers over email. "
"7744300","7745320"," It was really fucking nasty."
"7746720","7748540"," It was this big long to do."
"7749200","7750340"," It was this big long to do. "
"7751280","7752940"," I've had the same problems right now."
"7753120","7756920"," I'm having the same problems with a book map right now."
"7758440","7761200"," I'm having some issues and I have to deal with them. "
"7761500","7768540"," I just kind of found out that book maps have been overcharging me for like five months for a lot"
"7768540","7768840"," of money."
"7770360","7772240"," I'm like talking to this guy from book map."
"7772420","7775020"," They're talking to the support at book map. "
"7775500","7776580"," They don't think you have a life."
"7776820","7778580"," His life is just book map."
"7779560","7782000"," Which means I have to talk to them for like an hour and a half. "
"7783380","7784340"," I have to do my own research."
"7784860","7786420"," They're fucking websites."
"7787000","7788280"," Too much information sometimes. "
"7790620","7797700"," I sign up for a different news channel."
"7797700","7799740"," And it hasn't been playing and I don't know why."
"7800100","7801500"," So I just canceled that one. "
"7801740","7806700"," Matter of fact, when I get back here, I will have a new service back up and running for you"
"7806700","7808280"," guys in the next five minutes or so."
"7808320","7808660"," Ten minutes."
"7808840","7808960"," Okay. "
"7809280","7810180"," Let me just a five minute break."
"7810380","7810820"," I'll be right back."
"7811100","7813720"," I hope you got along like five, ten minutes and I'll be right back with you guys. "
"7816900","7817940"," Good question, Cody."
"7819420","7820420"," Give me just a minute."
"7820500","7820660"," Okay. "
"7820860","7821820"," I just need a quick break."
"7822220","8453920"," Yeah, just"
"8453920","8454700"," heads up out there."
"8455040","8458140"," Give me a, I'm still on a break, but give me a second here, but I just want you to"
"8458140","8458920"," be aware of that. "
"8460160","8462340"," My puts are gaining a little bit of premium right now."
"8462340","8466220"," So just be conscious of that even if we trade our price target below."
"8466520","8468620"," If we can get there is at least 433. "
"8473460","8475880"," I just don't mind to be aware that even though."
"8476920","8480820"," Get a little bit of a bid here, but watching a little bit of interest on."
"8481880","8483200"," The put side. "
"8483960","8484420"," So."
"8486560","8488260"," I see some, I see some calls."
"8489800","8493340"," Some interest then calls 435 C for Friday. "
"8494440","8498140"," 60,000 contracts, but then there's a ton of interest at 430 P."
"8499440","8503940"," And there's some interest at 425 P and then 420 P as well."
"8504820","8507820"," Kind of a mixed bag right now."
"8510060","8515060"," But I am short this market at this point and I think it's going to roll over. "
"8521700","8525640"," And it was part of the reason for that too is I, if we're going to trade higher."
"8526360","8530960"," If we're going to trade higher into on Monday, right after OpEx."
"8531800","8536680"," I think that the trade high, I don't think you're going to see huge market moves higher during"
"8536680","8537340"," OpEx. "
"8538600","8539820"," Sometimes you do rare."
"8540580","8542000"," Normally you see the market."
"8543420","8545220"," On quad whichings, you see them. "
"8547980","8549440"," Roll over as."
"8550200","8553600"," As the market makes a decision for what it's going to do in the next three months, you don't"
"8553600","8554360"," typically see."
"8554840","8558580"," Like banda banda rallies over quad whichings. "
"8558820","8561380"," It's just, it's just not that it's, it's just rare."
"8562000","8562920"," It's not really."
"8563980","8564860"," The usual. "
"9864680","9865820"," Yeah, I'm still taking a break."
"9865820","9870960"," I'm eating an apple right now at the moment that I want to eat an apple live on the air."
"9871860","9873400"," It's like five or minutes. "
"9879820","9882940"," At the same time what I was doing was I was looking at."
"9884440","9885880"," See guys that I'm looking at here."
"9886500","9887420"," Take a quick break here. "
"9889220","9890540"," So what was I looking at?"
"9892300","9893560"," Just so you guys can see."
"9894960","9896500"," So over here what I'm looking at."
"9898060","9900300"," Is I'm looking at the spy right. "
"9901700","9906440"," And I was looking at Facebook to see if there was a potential for a rollover."
"9907600","9909160"," I'm watching over here."
"9909400","9911420"," Microsoft say they're looking to dump. "
"9912960","9914480"," Or squeeze higher."
"9915460","9918400"," You could look at this as a bull flag here."
"9919020","9921000"," But there's a divergence in. "
"9922940","9924340"," The small divergence."
"9925740","9927380"," In tech currently."
"9931540","9933600"," This is looking pretty spiky here, right?"
"9933820","9937060"," But at the same time, sometimes these bull flags aren't real, right?"
"9937220","9942440"," Sometimes you'll see this and in fact it's, it's weaker than it looks and. "
"9943540","9945480"," Facebook looks really strong right now, right?"
"9945600","9947380"," It's been strong for the past few days."
"9947980","9949640"," I like the Facebook trade, of course."
"9950240","9954060"," I like buying Facebook and there's a huge gap. "
"9954860","9956860"," Beautiful gap right here needs to be filled."
"9957580","9960040"," So there is a kick ass long trade in Facebook."
"9960720","9961720"," Believe it or not. "
"9962680","9967580"," But I'm looking at other tickers to be like, hey, is this looking kind of rolly pull here?"
"9968000","9972300"," And does it drag down maybe Facebook at the same time?"
"9973340","9973440"," Right?"
"9973700","9975440"," This is actually looking pretty, pretty bullish here."
"9976020","9977740"," I was looking at sending triangle to."
"9978140","9982220"," I feel this is called, but push up, push up, push up and then Bami go higher. "
"9983580","9986460"," So I'm just keeping an eye on something like this."
"9988620","9990880"," It's kind of a face ripper right here."
"9991520","9993120"," He'd be looking for on Microsoft. "
"9994120","9995880"," And then I'm going to be looking at Tesla."
"9998000","10001160"," And just checking the internals of all of these."
"10001600","10003280"," This trade actually worked out pretty well. "
"10003460","10004260"," This downward move here."
"10005560","10006820"," Where does this trade go?"
"10006920","10008420"," Does it actually trade up to 872?"
"10008640","10010660"," How much room does it have if it rolls over?"
"10010660","10012760"," Does it actually trade up higher here?"
"10013160","10014760"," I'm going to look at Apple as well."
"10017280","10020040"," And just looking at that same thing over here, right?"
"10020880","10022860"," It's kind of looking healthy, but not quite. "
"10025180","10028940"," This isn't really the version of Webull that I use too often."
"10029120","10031320"," This is one on another computer that I'm looking at right now."
"10032200","10034260"," So this could be very bullish right here. "
"10035380","10039760"," One, two, big, larger move higher, strong move higher."
"10039760","10042360"," Or we start to roll over here."
"10043920","10046300"," So what am I looking for right now, right?"
"10047200","10048960"," I'm looking for a bid into the market. "
"10049520","10051700"," Looking for a waterfall of calls."
"10054410","10056110"," There's a little bit of calls coming in."
"10056510","10057350"," But I'm looking for a waterfall. "
"10057350","10060070"," I want to see a waterfall of calls coming into the market."
"10061090","10063850"," And I'm looking for large scale buyers."
"10064310","10065850"," We're seeing not on the spy right now. "
"10067530","10071030"," And we're looking at some call action come in right now."
"10071450","10073710"," To see if we can push this up higher."
"10074290","10075210"," Same thing over here, right?"
"10075650","10080810"," The whole market's kind of at that point where the question becomes, do we crank?"
"10083960","10085240"," Do we crank higher here?"
"10086220","10086240"," Right?"
"10086420","10088700"," This would be a huge move for the bulls. "
"10089500","10091940"," Or do we start to roll over here?"
"10092780","10094420"," And so I don't have the answer to that at the moment."
"10094440","10095600"," So I'm just trying to look around."
"10095840","10097120"," We know that the advance to Kleiner. "
"10097340","10099680"," As a matter of fact, I'll try to bring up the advance to Kleiner here."
"10100220","10105480"," I'll take a look at the AD line and hold on here."
"10106140","10107080"," I'm going to eat that real quick. "
"10107660","10108420"," Let me just a second here."
"10108520","10112020"," What I'll do is I'll bring up the trades on trading view."
"10115140","10116800"," Let me just a second here. "
"10117500","10118600"," I usually look at it on."
"10120780","10125160"," As you look at it on thinkorswim the AD line."
"10126580","10127560"," But I think we can. "
"10146400","10148140"," See, I'm going to look at the sort of five days."
"10151140","10153060"," I thought this was supported on weekly."
"10154040","10154440"," Oh, great. "
"10154760","10155380"," I still have a second here."
"10162760","10163340"," Excuse me."
"10165780","10171320"," So I'm looking at the AD line. "
"10172500","10174280"," This is kind of nice to see right here, right?"
"10174400","10176760"," This is the this is August 20."
"10177020","10177700"," Wait a minute."
"10177780","10179420"," I'm on the wrong line here. "
"10181920","10183400"," Let me just a second here."
"10189920","10191320"," Being a pain in the ass now."
"10202480","10205600"," So you can see in the 21st, this is really nice to see here. "
"10205980","10208900"," A little bit of push down here on the 7th of March."
"10208920","10211400"," But for the week and the 14th, this is this week."
"10212480","10212800"," Right here. "
"10213340","10215340"," This is the important thing you want to be seeing, right?"
"10215500","10217900"," Advancers are overcoming declineers."
"10218240","10220040"," This is the AD line right here."
"10220620","10222880"," It's still a battle between the bulls and the bears. "
"10223620","10224880"," The bulls are winning currently."
"10225200","10226480"," You want to be seeing this right here."
"10226900","10228800"," It's a nice, a nice wick to be seeing. "
"10229740","10232380"," You can actually see other examples of that in the past."
"10233060","10233780"," We sell down."
"10233980","10235560"," We have plenty of room here to be moving up. "
"10237580","10240240"," So we're looking to keep track of this advanced decline."
"10240240","10242480"," The event is very nice right now."
"10244930","10248910"," Some accumulation back in December, January, February 22nd. "
"10249630","10251650"," Of course, we have March 22nd right now."
"10252250","10254850"," So we're going to keep an eye on this on advanced declineers."
"10255050","10258290"," Make sure that everything is well and good in the market. "
"10259170","10262230"," And if we're going to roll this over, I am short the market right now."
"10262570","10265450"," I think that we look for more consolidation."
"10266170","10268970"," Then we have the breakout further down the line. "
"10268970","10273790"," It's somewhere here in the 18 or the 21st."
"10275610","10277090"," Or possibly even deeper."
"10278430","10279830"," On the 31st. "
"10279970","10281010"," Bull's want it right now."
"10281470","10282150"," Bull's the one to wait."
"10283390","10288330"," Bull's are saying, hey, look, we got puts rolling off on Friday. "
"10288590","10292070"," We got puts rolling off on the 31st."
"10292150","10295290"," All these puts are going to roll off and buyers are going to step in here."
"10295870","10302910"," My thought on this is it's hard to say because you don't normally see. "
"10303850","10307210"," Opex is just blast off on on like today."
"10307430","10309830"," You'd see it blast off on the close of Friday."
"10310310","10311710"," Lots of rotation in here. "
"10312710","10314830"," But I do like the idea of big tech."
"10315070","10320910"," I like the idea that I've got to list our baskets portfolio basket of stocks that I'm interested"
"10320910","10321370"," in."
"10321450","10323830"," Of course, part of that basket is big tech. "
"10323830","10325350"," They're proven winners."
"10325890","10335150"," Then comes real companies that can pass along cost to their buyers."
"10337470","10339170"," People have to buy certain things. "
"10339990","10346730"," And then my third part of my basket is going to be that speculative tech growth stocks that are"
"10346730","10349510"," performing above and beyond even in a shitty market."
"10350170","10352990"," As a matter of fact, I was just looking at another stock screener over here."
"10353730","10354910"," I think it was this one right here. "
"10357230","10360410"," Yeah, we had a 20 to 20 day moving average."
"10360490","10363410"," And then I'm actually looking for 52 week low as well."
"10365670","10367170"," And he has nothing there and new lows. "
"10367590","10369470"," These stocks are all performing today."
"10371250","10376710"," But yeah, you'd be looking at these ones just to see where the 52 week lows are and which ones"
"10376710","10377530"," are moving."
"10378790","10381530"," And the advanced ecliner is good on big tech right now. "
"10381570","10382950"," It's showing up in that chart right there."
"10384050","10386830"," So I'm just going to keep an eye on this if we continue to roll over or not."
"10387650","10391730"," And how much pain there should be written in here for bears. "
"10392790","10397590"," Have a four roller happens or when to take along on this chart."
"10397790","10398730"," Sometimes it's a fake out in here."
"10399170","10399790"," Let me just come a minute. "
"10399890","10403330"," I'm just going to finish up this apple and eating an apple, believe it or not."
"10403850","10404790"," And we'll start."
"10404950","10405430"," We'll chat again. "
"10414760","10415680"," You guys hear me?"
"10415740","10416360"," It says no sound."
"10416980","10418040"," Can you guys hear me right now?"
"10420200","10421880"," It says no sound."
"10458060","10460140"," It's got some puts coming on on hood. "
"10460480","10462960"," I'm looking to see if it's going to get a bounce off 1067."
"10463840","10466080"," It seems like pretty decent support on it."
"10466180","10467160"," Must have something we don't know. "
"10468400","10471700"," Maybe you look for a buy down here at 1024 at some point."
"10514250","10516330"," See that roll over an apple right now?"
"10516750","10518490"," Watch that roll over an apple."
"10518670","10519030"," Everything's looking. "
"10519250","10520410"," I mean, this looks bullish in the outset."
"10522650","10525070"," But then it spies looking pretty good, right?"
"10528130","10531880"," But it's not the movement you want to be seeing."
"10532120","10534220"," Like the one thing about this move right here, right?"
"10534740","10536100"," I want you to be paying attention to some. "
"10536280","10537880"," This is a learning moment for you."
"10537880","10538100"," Okay."
"10540540","10547120"," So one thing that's concerning in movements like this is you guys see moves like this, right?"
"10547440","10548760"," You guys see stuff like this, right?"
"10548980","10550020"," Roles over bam. "
"10550520","10551960"," Roles over bam, right?"
"10552220","10553880"," Roles down bam, bam."
"10554400","10555820"," You're not seeing that right now, right?"
"10556140","10558620"," You'll see that in these moves."
"10559400","10565280"," If they spend too much time around here and they can't go higher, they wind up rolling over. "
"10565280","10567200"," And so I just want you to be aware of that."
"10567280","10568000"," We can trade higher today."
"10568340","10570000"," I'm not starting to say that we don't trade higher today. "
"10570100","10574500"," What I'm trying to say to you is that when you're spending, we spent now."
"10575480","10576180"," Oh, what?"
"10576400","10578660"," So 9.30. It's what time right now?"
"10578680","10584400"," It's 11.37. It's been two hours of fucking around over here in this line."
"10585020","10586500"," And we can trade higher here. "
"10586640","10593880"," But my point to you is that when you spend so much time over here, that I start getting bearish"
"10593880","10595440"," on trades like this, right?"
"10595540","10600340"," I really want to see like, if I'm bullish on a day, like you guys want to be bullish on"
"10600340","10604620"," a day, like a day to take a long trade, you're looking more for like, let me say what you're"
"10604620","10605860"," looking for for being bullish."
"10606900","10608400"," You're looking for a move up, right?"
"10609500","10611940"," You're looking for a very short period, right?"
"10612580","10614780"," And you're, bam, straight up, something like that, right?"
"10615740","10617180"," Like really short period, right?"
"10617740","10618680"," And then bam, move up."
"10618860","10620440"," It's fast, right?"
"10620440","10623980"," And then about halfway through the day, you get the rollover effect, right?"
"10624020","10625820"," You start doing this kind of nonsense, right?"
"10626820","10629440"," Then you'll find a deep support heading into the close, right?"
"10630160","10632540"," And then you usually do some kind of goofiness like this. "
"10633280","10634280"," You guys know it, right?"
"10634460","10635320"," You guys know how this happens."
"10635800","10636820"," Some kind of deep pullback."
"10636980","10639740"," Then we go blasting off way higher, right?"
"10639880","10640460"," This is pretty common. "
"10640980","10642000"," This is set up right here."
"10642700","10644100"," This setup right here, right?"
"10644360","10644920"," It's pretty common."
"10645640","10647040"," This is a bullish day. "
"10647520","10650580"," This is how you know that you're being fucking bullish, right?"
"10650720","10651420"," It's the middle of the day."
"10651780","10652740"," Get that rollover."
"10653400","10656860"," Everyone's taking a lunch, trade down, drift down, come back up. "
"10657040","10657900"," A little more support, bang."
"10658020","10658680"," We go to the top, right?"
"10659080","10663320"," Something like this is typical, but you're looking for it."
"10663740","10665160"," It doesn't mean we don't trade higher here. "
"10665740","10670560"," I'm just saying that when I'm bullish, I should just barely be catching up."
"10670700","10671760"," I should be like, oh shit."
"10672460","10676960"," Am I going to be able to grab this before it makes this next leg higher?"
"10676960","10677280"," Right?"
"10677440","10679000"," Boom one, boom two, boom three. "
"10679200","10680120"," It's up, right?"
"10680220","10680700"," It's that resistance."
"10681180","10681920"," That's what I'm looking for."
"10682020","10683180"," That doesn't mean we don't trade higher. "
"10683580","10686560"," It doesn't mean we don't go to bounce off here at some point today."
"10687180","10692840"," I'm just saying when I'm bullish, I'm looking for fast moves and looking for making moves higher."
"10694240","10702260"," The one positive for bulls right now is you're not seeing the fission scams, right?"
"10703240","10704600"," We see lots of stop loss scams. "
"10705060","10708640"," Markets just kind of trade and slow and steady right now."
"10709180","10712340"," But when I see these kind of moves, typically you'll see a failure at some point."
"10713100","10717360"," You'll see this just burning, eating up calls, call start losing value. "
"10717980","10720860"," And if bulls don't keep buying it here, it eventually rolls over."
"10721060","10724880"," What you end up getting is you end up getting some more, you know, something like this, right?"
"10725160","10725760"," You made some money."
"10726260","10729060"," You bought back in, you kind of making money, but not really. "
"10729880","10730980"," Runways running out, right?"
"10730980","10732920"," And it trades back down over here."
"10733320","10734980"," Kind of nonsense like this, right?"
"10735180","10736000"," And you're just like, fuck this."
"10736160","10739080"," I'm getting chewed up and it gets sold off. "
"10739260","10740240"," I'm not saying it's going to happen today."
"10740300","10746580"," I'm just saying to you that if you are a bull and when you are bullish, you're looking for fast"
"10746580","10747220"," moves up."
"10748040","10751100"," You're going to take your money and run, let it consolidate, right?"
"10752540","10753820"," You guys know all about distribution. "
"10754920","10757040"," You guys know about accumulation and distribution."
"10757660","10760300"," If this is an accumulation phase and it's up here, sure."
"10760300","10763900"," I can see that, but this looks more like this. "
"10764100","10765140"," I'm going to tell you what this looks like."
"10765240","10765440"," Okay."
"10766480","10767520"," Show it to you right here. "
"10768540","10768940"," Okay."
"10769400","10770540"," So I actually bought this."
"10771340","10773080"," Actually, matter of fact, I bought this. "
"10773520","10774300"," I think I bought this one."
"10774360","10775920"," I think this is Sunday or Friday, Sunday or Monday."
"10776580","10776700"," I think. "
"10777560","10779060"," But I bought this and I bought all this."
"10780020","10781900"," I made all this money and I made all this money."
"10782400","10785440"," And then I took this short yesterday and then I missed it. "
"10785440","10790360"," So I just say I actually took this with the wrong calls and I got burned in this trade."
"10791720","10793860"," But I ended up taking a short in here."
"10794320","10796920"," And the reason is because this big move right here, right?"
"10797380","10800060"," This is this is actually the accumulation was over here. "
"10800620","10800880"," Right."
"10801120","10807180"," It moves on up, makes new highs and now there should be some sort of a pullback, even if we're"
"10807180","10807660"," going higher."
"10808320","10813140"," Even if it's not playing out at this moment, there should be a slight roll over in the market. "
"10813140","10815460"," And then another push higher."
"10816760","10821820"," So this going so slow here bothers me right here."
"10822100","10825120"," So anyways, we'll see what happens here. "
"10825260","10826780"," We'll see if it rolls over or not."
"10826960","10829860"," It is making another move to the to to highs up here."
"10830480","10831500"," You guys can see. "
"10834710","10836990"," You guys can see what's going on up here."
"10836990","10837250"," Right."
"10837570","10839070"," Still have some sellers above here. "
"10839630","10840690"," Still have accumulation."
"10841270","10843410"," You can see accumulation taking place today."
"10844750","10846790"," Rotation trade taking place today. "
"10848170","10852790"," And so I'm just I just got some some puts here and I'll keep adding as we eventually roll down"
"10852790","10853510"," over here on the right."
"10854250","10855390"," And I'll be back in just a minute."
"10871220","10873240"," Hey, Michael, they just give me just a couple seconds brother. "
"10873940","10875740"," Yeah, I got a bunch of new shit."
"10877860","10882220"," I got a bunch of new like I had to get a new graphics card in the graphics card."
"10882220","10885020"," My third graphics card, I'm not happy with this one. "
"10885560","10892900"," I have to I have to process video before it gets even to the computer."
"10893740","10894540"," So whatever."
"10895160","10896640"," I'll be back here in just a couple of seconds. "
"10896840","10896920"," Okay."
"10899640","10904020"," Yeah, no, I'm not I'm interested more in this trade over the next few days."
"10904140","10905360"," Next two days actually. "
"10905920","10906320"," I'm interested."
"10906740","10909100"," I'm not day trading at the at this brief moment here."
"10909300","10910640"," I'm just sitting on some stuff. "
"10910640","10914200"," But if you guys want to do like a fast trade, we can at some point."
"11531580","11532760"," All right, I'm back here."
"11540080","11625120"," We just a second here. "
"11687380","11687900"," Oh."
"11690540","11698980"," I'm over here getting weird with my getting weird."
"11786470","11796370"," Yeah, I'm over here trying to in the background, I'm"
"11796370","11797270"," trying to mess with. "
"11798990","11800050"," Here we go."
"11800870","11801530"," Come on."
"11813780","11814820"," Hold out here. "
"11834620","11835680"," Same tight here."
"11838680","11840960"," Having some technical difficulties in the background."
"11842180","11844600"," I'm over here trying to move around some some screeners. "
"11892310","11892930"," All right."
"11893190","11893750"," So I'm back."
"11894130","11894590"," I think I'm back. "
"11894830","11896730"," I was trying to fuck around some stuff here in the background."
"11896830","11897430"," I apologize."
"11900400","11902060"," I'm over here trying to do a bunch of stuff. "
"11902240","11904180"," And I'm like, what am I doing?"
"11917280","11918000"," All right."
"11919360","11920460"," Let's see if I can."
"11921160","11924260"," Let me just a second here. "
"11937120","11939260"," I need to move my mic to."
"11949980","11960760"," Oh, yeah."
"11967530","11973390"," Did you guys just hear by chance that guy speaking in the background?"
"11981910","11983610"," You can't post anything, Ed. "
"11984230","11985510"," Did you confirm your account?"
"11988450","11989590"," We need to add."
"11997540","11999080"," We just a second here, boys and girls."
"12010260","12014340"," You guys here, guys, speaking of the background, you know, I think I'm having problems with is"
"12014340","12021690"," giving me just a second here. "
"12038480","12040500"," Let me give me just a second here."
"12044390","12048810"," I am going to put you on the chart screen for just a moment."
"12050800","12051390"," All right. "
"12052330","12053510"," I'm just a second here."
"12067560","12068490"," Media source."
"12073740","12075100"," You just a second here. "
"12077400","12079640"," Microcellular box, post settings."
"12084900","12087320"," Give me just a second here, boys and girls."
"12093660","12097740"," Audio capture, add source. "
"12108990","12109670"," Desktop audio."
"12138380","12140280"," Check one, two, you guys can still have me out there."
"12147420","12151890"," I think I have to"
"12151890","12162390"," think"
"12162390","12164710"," that I've got this going now. "
"12164830","12166090"," Yeah, there we go."
"12166850","12167510"," All right."
"12167770","12168690"," Desktop audio is enabled. "
"12168930","12172750"," Let me know if you guys hear a voice like a, if I've got a guy speaking of the news"
"12172750","12173990"," in the background at some point."
"12175710","12179710"," And we will see if we hear news being spoken."
"12181370","12182470"," Move this over. "
"12192330","12194010"," Static rain is gone now."
"12197850","12198790"," Big static."
"12199150","12203010"," Is it, are you guys still hearing a, are you guys still hearing static right now?"
"12208710","12209370"," Let me know. "
"12209950","12211210"," Is it still raining on your end?"
"12215070","12216630"," You can go over Microsoft real quick."
"12217170","12218850"," Let me know if the static rain is gone now."
"12225510","12231270"," Let me just a second here. "
"12236010","12237790"," We're going to look at CCJ real quick."
"12238970","12240770"," Why is a million dollars in calls on this?"
"12243570","12244750"," More buyers than sellers."
"12247870","12254190"," Some calls just came through a golden ticket on CCJ. "
"12262150","12264870"," Is that a five March 20th?"
"12267570","12269770"," 25C looks like it's already made its move."
"12275390","12277390"," It's just been cranking and cranking."
"12280910","12282570"," It's been moving all morning. "
"12282570","12290450"," Take another step higher, $28, $28.50 and 30 and CCJ."
"12297630","12299130"," We'll look at Microsoft."
"12308970","12312750"," As from books, some day ahead you might link capacity to Germany. "
"12315150","12316810"," As you guys just hear of that guy talking."
"12328610","12332870"," As the question is on Microsoft, is there resistance here at 300 or not?"
"12333030","12334050"," We're currently trading at 290."
"12334050","12335610"," Here indicator is green. "
"12336130","12338990"," More sellers than buyers, though, on Microsoft."
"12341070","12343570"," You guys are glad here."
"12354920","12356720"," We're looking at Microsoft chart right now. "
"12357640","12358780"," We're looking at Microsoft."
"12359420","12361940"," We're going to bring up the Microsoft chart in just a moment here."
"12363400","12364400"," We're looking at here. "
"12364580","12366620"," We've got a little bit of resistance above 300."
"12367500","12370240"," We already bounced off 300 in the past."
"12371380","12373260"," Here indicator is slightly negative. "
"12373980","12378240"," The key here is that you've got more sellers than you have buyers on Microsoft."
"12379580","12382920"," The question becomes, does it start to roll over or not?"
"12383360","12384880"," How deep does it roll over?"
"12385480","12387500"," This is showing firm support at 270."
"12388780","12391020"," 270 is where it took off at. "
"12393620","12398880"," We're going to look at the hero indicator on this chart."
"12398880","12400540"," This is what I want you to see."
"12401760","12403000"," Someone was asking about Microsoft. "
"12403420","12407680"," I'm looking at Microsoft as if you look at the Microsoft chart."
"12408100","12409860"," Let's go back to the Microsoft chart."
"12410820","12411920"," Look at the chart. "
"12412140","12413800"," Chart looks like it's going up."
"12414340","12418460"," This chart looks like a nice beautiful bull wedge."
"12419200","12420520"," We're going to trade this pitch up. "
"12420680","12421140"," That's what we're going to do."
"12421260","12423020"," I shouldn't even be saying that, but boom."
"12423240","12424400"," Price target above 300. "
"12426120","12428380"," We already know the resistance above here at 300."
"12428680","12430280"," I don't know what this thing is doing here either."
"12430960","12432440"," We've got some weird shit going on. "
"12433140","12434700"," We've got artifacts and stuff."
"12434960","12438320"," The question becomes, though, is this going to trade up to 300?"
"12439600","12441300"," Are we going to make a power move up here?"
"12444940","12446580"," Or are we going to roll it over?"
"12447300","12452240"," Or does it do something more like this where it just doesn't make it?"
"12452340","12453140"," It just keeps falling."
"12455500","12456440"," That's my question. "
"12456460","12457260"," Is it coming over here?"
"12457440","12458160"," Or is it going higher?"
"12458840","12462020"," Now, there's a divergence in the market currently."
"12462340","12465220"," Whether you believe this or not, believe it, doesn't matter."
"12465480","12469260"," The fact is that there's a divergence in the market right now. "
"12469380","12472380"," If you look here and, wait a minute."
"12473300","12483130"," If you start to look here on this book map, right, and you start to look"
"12483130","12484150"," behind in time."
"12484150","12485670"," It's now 11 o'clock. "
"12485670","12486810"," It's not 11.15, right?"
"12486870","12487350"," Times it now."
"12488110","12489690"," It's 12.08, excuse me."
"12490690","12494710"," But the hair indicator has been crossing negative on Microsoft. "
"12495490","12499130"," If you're looking at Microsoft and the outside looking in, it looks healthy."
"12499510","12502290"," It looks like it should blast off here."
"12502990","12508370"," But if you're looking at the internals of Microsoft, it's not looking like that. "
"12508510","12511630"," It's looking like it's going to trade back down to this 270 down below."
"12511630","12516610"," Now, if Microsoft will trade down a 270 right now and you're a bull, you're going to get fucking"
"12516610","12517170"," blast."
"12517410","12518510"," You're ass blasted in here. "
"12518670","12520510"," You're going to get your ass blasted in here."
"12520930","12528390"," So I'm trying to look at the underlying tickers within, you know, underneath the hood of the"
"12528390","12528690"," queues."
"12529250","12530330"," Microsoft being one of them. "
"12530990","12532450"," Apple and Amazon."
"12532790","12537290"," Tesla always other companies in saying to myself, hey, is this actually going up?"
"12537430","12538170"," Is this going down?"
"12539110","12540610"," Do we have more sellers than buyers?"
"12540610","12542510"," Spy looks like we got lots of buyers."
"12542690","12544010"," Everyone's like, hell yeah, we're buying the spy. "
"12544570","12545430"," We're going up."
"12545750","12552330"," But then the leading indicators of the spires telling a different story right now as to what's"
"12552330","12553410"," taking place in the market."
"12558370","12563470"," I'm also concerned with the basing going on in the VIX. "
"12563590","12565090"," The VIX hasn't sold shit off yet."
"12565950","12568310"," So I don't know what everybody's saying with the VIX being sold off."
"12569330","12570950"," I'm looking at the VIX right now. "
"12573350","12576730"," And, you know, I mean, it's sold off a little bit."
"12577030","12583030"," Sold off down to 2606 currently traded up higher to 2785 sold back down."
"12583110","12584450"," It's down to 2604. "
"12585190","12589930"," So I'm wondering, I'm wondering, is it trade higher or does it break here?"
"12590530","12595070"," So it's either basing right now or it's going to have a capitulation move down."
"12595250","12596090"," We're getting close to it."
"12596090","12602430"," If we look at the VIX right now, right, here's the VIX. "
"12602770","12605710"," And the question becomes, is this basing?"
"12605970","12609270"," Is this the basing pattern over here or is this not a basing pattern?"
"12609310","12609810"," I don't know."
"12610290","12613230"," I don't know what the answer is on this right here."
"12613930","12615230"," What this is right here. "
"12615330","12621350"," If this is basing, right, or if this is looking for a move down higher, do we end up getting"
"12621350","12626650"," the capitulation move down, forcing markets higher?"
"12627470","12630610"," Or is this just, it's just like this right here, right?"
"12630930","12632590"," Come down here and then bam, may get to move up."
"12634350","12635890"," And the market starts to sell off."
"12637410","12638270"," So I don't know. "
"12638910","12643370"," So I'm trying to look at tickers and, you know, if you look at Microsoft, it's not looking good."
"12644010","12646810"," Microsoft is looking pretty bad right now."
"12646850","12648330"," It's not looking too healthy. "
"12649710","12652130"," And Facebook's starting to curl over a little bit as well."
"12652130","12656430"," So I don't know exactly where we are in the market per se."
"12656870","12659010"," I am still short this market right here. "
"12659250","12666050"," And I'll continue to add to short on this market as we, if we trade higher, I'll continue to add"
"12666050","12667530"," short somewhere up in here."
"12668290","12672290"," Mostly because of the move that we've made for the past three days."
"12673590","12679590"," I was long, as a matter of fact, I've been long since somewhere back here and traded this all the"
"12679590","12679870"," way up. "
"12679870","12684210"," So one, two, three long days."
"12685390","12686610"," I think we're getting close."
"12686870","12691650"," We're getting, we're starting to get long in the tooth here, especially with OPEC's being here. "
"12691870","12697830"," So I would just keep rolling through all these different tickers and seeing what is happening in"
"12697830","12701230"," the market currently if we're going to make this leg higher."
"12701810","12704690"," If you guys are just tuning in right now, there's a few things for you."
"12705110","12711070"," So this white line that's at an angle here goes all the way back to January. "
"12712010","12715690"," So it starts way back here on January 4th, right?"
"12715870","12721050"," You see we got a kind of a touch back here, another touch back here on the 10th, right?"
"12721210","12725490"," Touch bear, we sold here on the 13th, we sold here on the 10th or so, right?"
"12725690","12728210"," And we're right back up in there right now."
"12728490","12731230"," Now, I'm bullish right now in this market, believe it or not."
"12731330","12732990"," I'm actually have changed my view. "
"12733490","12737630"," Even if we trade down a 405, I'm bullish macro speaking at this point."
"12737630","12744690"," Because my take is that the Fed is going to blow this market up big, like big, big, big down"
"12744690","12745050"," the road."
"12745690","12747450"," So do we trade above this?"
"12747670","12752750"," Probably trade above this at some point that we break through. "
"12753350","12758030"," If you're going to make this power move in here, and then you've got puts rolling off, should we"
"12758030","12758630"," trade up higher?"
"12758990","12761490"," Yeah, I don't think, not think that we don't."
"12762050","12768310"," But I do think that there's possibly a relief coming in down here for the next leg higher."
"12768550","12778510"," I think we do head into, and I don't think you see the power move until Friday close or possibly"
"12778510","12779350"," Monday open. "
"12779850","12782610"," It could be more capitulation over the weekend to fuck any bulls in here."
"12783150","12784070"," No offense to bulls."
"12784810","12788990"," Any of you that don't know me, I've been a bull for, I'm still inside. "
"12790270","12794410"," I am a bull, but I do take the short trade when it calls for."
"12794410","12797910"," And this looks to me, I wouldn't be long here."
"12798250","12802510"," This is where the money was, and this is where the FOMO is. "
"12802890","12805810"," So even if it moves up here, I'm not interested in it."
"12806130","12809730"," I'm interested in the next nice, beautiful, huge move higher."
"12811590","12815650"," And I'll leave, like, if you're filling a bag up, you guys hear about bag holding, right?"
"12816270","12819830"," I fill it up, you fill it up, another guy fills it up, another guy fills it up over here,"
"12819950","12824430"," and you're trying to find buyers and you're saying to buyers, hey, look, there's a little bit more"
"12824430","12825810"," room in here for you. "
"12826390","12829350"," You can make some money to market sources here."
"12829550","12830930"," Russia bond coupon payments."
"12831110","12832450"," That would you on March 16th. "
"12832510","12834350"," We received up on holders in dollars."
"12837160","12841640"," And so the question becomes, how much room is left in that bag to fill up in here?"
"12842200","12848480"," And so what I'm looking more for is the next, even if it's not a leg down, I'm looking more"
"12848480","12850960"," for the roll over here to make that money."
"12850960","12856140"," And then as soon as you roll over here, I'll look for the next leg up as a bull, of"
"12856140","12856340"," course. "
"12856680","12860000"," I was, I am long this market in general."
"12861540","12863180"," So I hope you guys can see all that."
"12864300","12866400"," See where we actually are here. "
"12867120","12870360"," And, you know, I'm looking more for something down here, if not even deeper."
"12871540","12873280"," So then you've got a bunch of OPEC shit."
"12873440","12876300"," You've got a bunch of quad-witching shit. "
"12876860","12878880"," And then you've got a bunch of spreads out there."
"12878880","12881200"," You got the JPM collar you got to deal with."
"12881660","12882420"," That's over here. "
"12882540","12885260"," I think that actually goes into the 31st."
"12885820","12888440"," We'll talk about that at a later date, the JPM collar."
"12888740","12890540"," And we've got the cowboy out there trading as well. "
"12891140","12892380"," Some of you guys probably know about the cowboy."
"12892520","12893940"," Some of you guys probably don't know about the cowboy."
"12894380","12896740"," We'll have a conversation about his ass as well. "
"12897940","12900900"," So there are other market mechanics going on here."
"12900960","12902840"," I know that this can look very bullish."
"12903460","12906480"," But we've talked in the past about what bullish moves look like in a day. "
"12906480","12912560"," And even if we grind higher here, even if we melt up here, this is not the trading action of"
"12912560","12914360"," being bullish."
"12914560","12915120"," I'm sorry."
"12915400","12917540"," So I know what bull days are. "
"12917840","12919180"," I trade bull days all the time."
"12919700","12920460"," I've been trading for years."
"12920740","12923500"," I just charted one out for you on this daily chart. "
"12924220","12925760"," What a bull day should look like."
"12926240","12929000"," And this looks more like a rolling over kind of day."
"12929660","12931060"," We know we can have a move higher. "
"12931360","12933320"," If we have a headline news that sends us higher, that's possible."
"12933680","12934300"," We can get that in there."
"12934300","12939280"," But just so you know, the longer we trade sideways as we add those days up, what happens, right?"
"12939440","12941920"," We end up trading sideways and down to consolidation. "
"12942260","12945980"," And then we find that consolidation and that power move higher."
"12952140","12953320"," That power move."
"12954240","12955220"," The power move. "
"12961740","12962860"," Hey, estate humble."
"12963160","12963640"," Good to see you."
"12964800","12966520"," So that's what you guys saying here, right?"
"12966520","12968340"," Vic's is falling off a cliff. "
"12968340","12968980"," It should."
"12969460","12971860"," So Chase brings up a good point."
"12972280","12973740"," So Chase is saying that. "
"12974640","12977280"," Vic's is falling off a cliff."
"12977460","12977880"," It should."
"12978520","12980680"," This is the thing. "
"12980960","12983140"," Vic's should fall off a cliff."
"12983720","12985100"," Between now and Friday."
"12985600","12987080"," There's no reason why it shouldn't. "
"12987600","12989540"," These puts should lose value."
"12990460","12994500"," We shouldn't trade down to 400 or anything crazy like that."
"12994500","12997020"," Mostly due to the fact that. "
"12998480","13000740"," That these, these puts should expire worthless."
"13001140","13004280"," They're not going to pay and print the puts down at 400 for the 18th."
"13004480","13008600"," We kind of already knew that heading into heading into FOMC. "
"13009600","13011860"," There's still a lot of calls though way, way higher."
"13012500","13014700"," That already in the money, believe it or not."
"13015940","13016940"," For months ago. "
"13017140","13021020"," So we want to, I want to see or not the money."
"13021200","13022080"," They haven't come into the money."
"13022080","13023980"," They're not going to want these in the money higher. "
"13024960","13029500"," So I think, I think if I had to guess that into Friday, OPEC."
"13029740","13031260"," So we burn all these puts down below."
"13031680","13033560"," We're going to burn all the calls up above. "
"13034200","13038340"," And we're going to trade sideways and down into Friday."
"13038920","13040600"," That's my, that's my guess at this point."
"13040940","13042300"," No matter what it looks like out there. "
"13042480","13044360"," And the Vic should fall off at the same time."
"13044640","13045640"," That can still happen."
"13046620","13048680"," You guys can, you guys can often see. "
"13049220","13052300"," The VIX move higher when we move higher and you can see VIX."
"13053300","13056080"," Roll over and we still trade sideways and down."
"13056380","13058800"," Even though the VIX is showing something completely different. "
"13060740","13062240"," So that was extremely loud."
"13062380","13063600"," I'll turn that down lower than."
"13064140","13065940"," I'll turn that guys that voice down. "
"13066080","13066980"," Thanks Josh for saying something."
"13071160","13074680"," Your favorite macro indicator points to crash in the next three months."
"13074980","13076260"," We'll talk about that this morning. "
"13080360","13081760"," We cover Tesla yet."
"13081960","13084220"," Who is the cowboy you're supposed to tell us we was a while back."
"13084780","13085840"," What's the macro indicator?"
"13089400","13091320"," We'll look at Tesla real quick. "
"13092260","13095360"," And let me switch over here for you guys so we can see Tesla."
"13098480","13103380"," So there's, so we, so there's like, there's two Cowboys basically, right?"
"13103600","13107800"," There's, there's, what's his name there?"
"13107800","13108740"," Hold on a second here."
"13111230","13113650"," There's basically, there's basically Carl Eiken. "
"13114330","13115110"," There's two Cowboys."
"13115650","13116750"," There's Carl, Carl Eiken."
"13117610","13120110"," And there's a douche bag. "
"13121690","13122530"," What's his name?"
"13123730","13126330"," I'm not always, but I'm forgetting his name right now."
"13128630","13132430"," Who's the guy that called the crash back in, uh, in 2020?"
"13135090","13138110"," And they put huge, huge spreads in the market."
"13138110","13141230"," They put, uh, they put giant fucking spreads in the market. "
"13141910","13144750"," And they do it when we're at bottoms and they do it when we're at tops."
"13145650","13148050"," And they're trying to fuck each other at all times."
"13149810","13152290"," So we're, we're crashing back up again at this resistance point. "
"13153090","13157350"," I'll switch back over so you can see it on, so you can see it on."
"13158190","13162160"," I'll show you the same chart again."
"13162300","13164220"," We'll get a little bit closer so you guys can see. "
"13165980","13168320"," To have one move up here, right?"
"13168820","13169700"," Bounce off it."
"13169960","13171700"," Another powerful move up here."
"13172300","13173700"," Nice, gorgeous support here. "
"13174140","13176340"," Coming back up almost to the pin, right?"
"13176720","13176980"," Second time."
"13177660","13178400"," Almost to the pin."
"13179040","13183740"," You can see it again on book map. "
"13184580","13186840"," See if I can show you guys here."
"13188120","13191660"," And you're also watching the divergence in the hero indicator here."
"13191660","13194700"," So we'll see if we can break through and trade higher here. "
"13195280","13201380"," We, I will give this a move higher to 440 or as high as 440."
"13202120","13204740"," So that, um, I'm going to stay short."
"13205180","13206260"," I should say up to 440. "
"13208700","13210700"," And we'll see if we find resistance."
"13210860","13215900"," If we roll, if this is a rolling over move in the market, or if this is actually a move"
"13215900","13219040"," to break out of law, a long time."
"13219040","13220900"," I mean, this is a long time. "
"13220920","13222220"," It's been going back three months, right?"
"13222620","13224660"," It's been going back since the beginning of January."
"13225340","13228340"," Uh, this is the high point of resistance in the market."
"13228820","13230520"," So we'll see if we can squeeze higher. "
"13231000","13237860"," Uh, we're now trading to 437, 07, 437, 10, 437, 15, 437, 29."
"13238940","13242700"," Uh, we'll keep an eye here and see if we can continue to trade higher."
"13242700","13248380"," And the spot gamma level for today was a max of 440. "
"13249020","13254720"," If you can break above 440 up in here and settle above 440, then the next target is 450."
"13256640","13259000"," I got shorts being squeezed out."
"13259220","13260400"," I'm still in my short position. "
"13261000","13261720"," I haven't left."
"13262000","13263300"," I'm still, I'm still in here."
"13263920","13265560"," Um, so I don't think I can get squeezed. "
"13266220","13270520"," Maybe I could get squeezed, I think, but I'll hold and add at 437."
"13270520","13275180"," I'll probably add some right now and I'll add some more 440 for the rollover."
"13279720","13281820"," Yeah, it's a blackman. "
"13282280","13282820"," Not Atkinson."
"13283400","13284320"," Bill Ackman is the other cowboy."
"13285300","13287100"," And so they trade against each other inside the market. "
"13287440","13292520"," And I'll post, I'll bring up their trades for you guys and show them to you."
"13292800","13294960"," You can see where they're pulling out spreads."
"13295460","13302560"," They're buying and selling large, large, large spreads that tend to make the market move into the"
"13302560","13303560"," direction they want them to. "
"13312140","13315600"," Uh, yeah, Bill Hell is coming Ackman."
"13316000","13317860"," Uh, did I see the Peter Schiff tweet?"
"13318080","13321700"," No, I didn't see the fucking tweet, but I did see some people freaking out about it."
"13321900","13323460"," I didn't read the tweet or whatever. "
"13323940","13326820"," Schiff's a fucking jack off if he's talking about blue Zelinsky."
"13326980","13328060"," That guy is a fucking beast."
"13328900","13333880"," That fucking Zelinsky is a fucking, that guy's got balls bigger than anybody out there. "
"13333880","13334980"," Think of it."
"13335060","13336220"," I think you guys think, right?"
"13336480","13341140"," Even if you're, I saw another tweet about how many state reps and senators are veterans."
"13341940","13343220"," I'll tell you what, okay. "
"13344480","13351220"," The, like the number of our politicians that would sucker down in a bunker in the White House for"
"13351220","13356420"," some shit like that are in Capitol Hill fucking maybe 1% of them."
"13356700","13360400"," Maybe, uh, Zelinsky doing what he's doing."
"13360400","13361860"," Even if he doesn't, he falls a fucking steal. "
"13362780","13363800"," Nobody can say shit."
"13366860","13368660"," I wouldn't short Tesla right now."
"13369140","13370440"," Deliveries are all around the corner. "
"13371220","13372900"," Agree Josh Tesla on the high 856."
"13373720","13376740"," Rich out of touch with reality fucking more and yeah, exactly."
"13377820","13378860"," Hey John, how you doing?"
"13379640","13381020"," Uh, so we'll look at Tesla real quick here. "
"13382940","13383840"," Take a look at Tesla."
"13384720","13389760"," Tesla's that same resistance point right above here at 856, 860."
"13389760","13391460"," Good place to take some profit on Tesla. "
"13392260","13394860"," And then you're, if you think we're going to make another move up on Tesla."
"13395340","13397780"," You pick Tesla back up again at 861."
"13398580","13406220"," And you would trade it to roughly, you have some volatility moving all the way up into the 89900"
"13406220","13406840"," area. "
"13408700","13410200"," Take a look up here again."
"13410900","13411760"," Right there."
"13411980","13415480"," If you can get above this area here, this area of 861. "
"13415480","13417900"," Get above 861, 829."
"13418140","13420880"," Take the next leg up for 900 on Tesla."
"13428770","13430670"," A beautiful move on the spy. "
"13431430","13434850"," Trying to break out from that resistance channel."
"13435150","13438270"," We've had this resistance channel here all the way back to China."
"13438690","13443950"," The French finance ministry is partially being evacuated due to a terrorism threat. "
"13445870","13448110"," Oh, terrorism threat in France."
"13473640","13474900"," I got to check something home."
"13475040","13475260"," Hold on. "
"13645340","13647660"," I think Zelensky gets too much praise."
"13648660","13649780"," No, I don't."
"13649920","13653060"," I think it's the praise for Zelensky is deserving. "
"13654440","13656720"," I think we don't have too many heroes out there."
"13656820","13657860"," I think it's fine to give him praise."
"13658940","13661100"," I think our heroes are rare. "
"13661920","13665440"," I think he's a good person to get praise."
"13665740","13667220"," I think if you look at him."
"13667220","13670020"," I saw a video of him. "
"13671500","13675520"," Yesterday and he looked he looked like he'd aged 20 years."
"13677320","13679780"," See, I think I think the praise is fine."
"13681320","13684480"," We knock so many people down out there that. "
"13686260","13688620"," Looking at a guy like that is not so bad."
"13695650","13698310"," The guy said there wouldn't be an invasion right up to the invasion."
"13698310","13701090"," He's begging the US for help now, but wouldn't take our world. "
"13701870","13706710"," Our word that Russia was going to invade, put all of his citizens in danger."
"13707250","13708190"," Yeah, I think that he."
"13708390","13710570"," I think that he can't. "
"13710690","13712430"," I think that they knew that they were invading."
"13712430","13714910"," I think that has more to do with other stuff."
"13718710","13723590"," They go break out time to cover short times cover shorts. "
"13725350","13727170"," Yeah, no, I don't agree with this at all."
"13727750","13728850"," I think this is just to hurt."
"13729030","13730530"," I think this is just meant to squeeze shorts. "
"13730530","13731710"," That's all it's meant for chase."
"13733330","13758190"," Yeah, I"
"13758190","13759950"," think the I think he has to be diplomatic."
"13759950","13762770"," I think he has to be I think you can't scare. "
"13762950","13766090"," You know, he doesn't want to cause fucking chaos with the population, either."
"13766850","13769310"," And they also need to keep people to defend."
"13771410","13778470"," I think there's there's so many mechanics in why he did or did interact with the way that he did. "
"13780090","13783610"," And it brings up the other question, right?"
"13783730","13787710"," If there's ever like a if there's ever like a meteor coming towards towards the world where they"
"13787710","13789330"," tell you they're going to die."
"13789330","13792250"," And of course you've got scientists that say, oh, we tell everybody."
"13792870","13796630"," The reality is they're more than likely not going to tell you that the meteor is coming to kill all"
"13796630","13797730"," of you into the last few minutes. "
"13798590","13802970"," Matter of fact, in the, you know, it's just like the warning system."
"13803390","13807930"," And remember when they announced the nuclear bomb or some was or a rocket was launched to Hawaii?"
"13808610","13814570"," I think they had like 15 minutes, 15, 15 minutes to find out."
"13815130","13821750"," And there were stories of people like trying to climb into sewers and stuff with their kids, I"

"13822050","13825310"," I think I remember one of those stories, some guy tried to climb into a sewer with his kids."
"13825850","13829410"," He created a lot of fair panic amongst the populace."
"13829590","13834450"," They get, you know, into trouble and you can cause more harm than good. "
"13834590","13836690"," Sometimes letting someone know and some bad's happening."
"13837390","13839530"," So that's always that's one of the philosophical questions."
"13839770","13841470"," Do you tell everybody that bad things are going to come?"
"13842330","13845790"," Or do you kind of lock them in and then tell them at the last minute, hey, this is what's"
"13845790","13846050"," happening. "
"13860340","13862120"," Vic's still rolling over right now."
"13865830","13867990"," Now trading down at 2561."
"13874940","13876980"," Test up 15 in the day. "
"13879480","13881940"," Apple still bouncing off its resistance here."
"13882240","13885440"," Even Apple still bouncing off its resistance here."
"13886140","13887620"," Nothing's really changed for me. "
"13887620","13889820"," I'm not day trading this at all."
"13889980","13891880"," I am looking for a short here."
"13892160","13892460"," That's it. "
"13893060","13894420"," All I'm looking for here."
"13896020","13902580"," If we trade higher from here, if we can trade higher than 440, I'll take another long there."
"13903280","13907980"," But anything in here for me is not saying anything I'm interested in. "
"13916620","13918580"," I think I'm bringing up 440 here."
"13919940","13927180"," As I said, 440, but it looks like if we break above 438, if you can actually break above 438,"
"13927680","13930120"," I don't see the sellers at 440 anymore."
"13930560","13932720"," And you guys can look here and see that there's no sellers. "
"13933200","13936140"," A little bit coming in just starting to come in at 439."
"13936500","13937860"," Maybe they're hidden sellers, not sure."
"13940730","13941930"," I might add some more shorts here. "
"13942050","13942210"," Hold on."
"13942450","13943410"," Not sharp, but long puts."
"13986020","13990200"," But it is cast and Russia wasn't evading rather than the cast after they invaded. "
"13990540","13991240"," I don't know."
"13993240","13998220"," It's a clip of Merrick Guy who went to fight for U.K.R. based up on lots of English"
"13998220","13999000"," Americans died."
"13999200","13999680"," They had no gear. "
"13999940","14001700"," So he had somebody's left and went for the border."
"14001900","14002640"," No, it didn't see that."
"14003860","14005440"," We need to task news. "
"14005780","14007860"," Russia's sanctioned lender BTP."
"14008640","14013080"," It says that they will hand over servicing of foreign securities to other financial companies."
"14015540","14016360"," Don't look up. "
"14016480","14016840"," Check it out."
"14016980","14017040"," Yeah."
"14017100","14017840"," I think I saw that movie. "
"14023200","14025880"," We're trying to go short into next week or just manana."
"14026140","14027900"," Where is the resistance for Tesla for the high?"
"14029100","14030120"," Sunday is spring soles."
"14030240","14031440"," This shit may hit the fan on Monday. "
"14031560","14032780"," Gold is turning sort of back up."
"14032920","14033640"," This looks pretty bullish."
"14034960","14035720"," The writing puts here. "
"14038980","14039860"," There's off the charts."
"14040560","14040620"," Yeah."
"14040960","14044240"," So this is all this here is to be expected. "
"14044560","14046160"," Everything that's happening right now."
"14047040","14048020"," Is to be expected."
"14048300","14048660"," Nothing here. "
"14048860","14049720"," Nothing that's happening right here."
"14049780","14052540"," We talked about this this morning that we could squeeze higher."
"14052780","14057220"," We talked about the three places I'm going to add puts here, here, and here this morning. "
"14057520","14058880"," We're talking about where the trade was."
"14059000","14060040"," I want you guys to see this."
"14060180","14060320"," Okay. "
"14061240","14063660"," I want you guys to see where this trade started."
"14066380","14067960"," Talk about this all the time."
"14068300","14071060"," And I know I understand where you guys are coming from. "
"14072660","14073800"," We're going to look at this one more time."
"14073880","14074040"," Okay."
"14074040","14075740"," I'll show you guys where the trade was. "
"14076460","14077840"," Trade was down here, right?"
"14078700","14080920"," Trade was actually actually started back here."
"14082740","14084040"," And there is consolidation."
"14084920","14085920"," Look at my cursor down here. "
"14086000","14086180"," Okay."
"14087420","14088480"," And this was for a move higher."
"14089740","14091240"," This shit's blasted off. "
"14091460","14096100"," Now does that mean that the trade doesn't go until we get up here?"
"14096360","14097080"," I think that it can."
"14097280","14098760"," I don't think that there's any issue."
"14099440","14102040"," I have no issue at all with this trade. "
"14103300","14104180"," Going to right here."
"14104340","14105260"," We had no issue."
"14105440","14106100"," I don't care if it's here. "
"14106380","14107000"," I don't care if it's here."
"14107460","14108480"," I don't care if it's right here."
"14109600","14110160"," All right. "
"14110360","14110620"," I don't."
"14111020","14117160"," I have no issues with that trade, but what I'm looking for is a trade of half back trade of"
"14117160","14120620"," some kind somewhere down in here to jump into."
"14121600","14122000"," Okay. "
"14122480","14128020"," So now that doesn't mean this happens, but puts us starting to get cheap over here."
"14128840","14129240"," Right."
"14129420","14131400"," And they're going to get cheaper and cheaper as we roll over here. "
"14131400","14135020"," Now some you can have both saying we're going to go higher, higher, higher."
"14135040","14136160"," We're going to 450 right now."
"14136520","14141060"," It's possible that we do, but you have to understand that the trade. "
"14141900","14142420"," Right."
"14143420","14144980"," The trade was way over here."
"14145060","14147420"," And even even this move higher. "
"14147760","14152420"," It's kind of like being down here and a bear saying we're going lower."
"14154300","14158280"," When the reality is you wanted to position for higher here, right?"
"14158280","14163240"," So sometimes that takes one, two, three days for that move to take place."
"14163920","14169200"," Sometimes it rolls right away, but the on the downside move, right?"
"14169560","14171700"," So we could trade up even higher here. "
"14172420","14176180"," And my take is that we still roll here at some point."
"14176700","14179060"," This can be this can happen right here."
"14179660","14181320"," It can happen up high here. "
"14181740","14182800"," It can happen over here."
"14182900","14183380"," It doesn't matter."
"14183720","14188120"," So I'm starting to take a short position to roll this market over. "
"14188120","14189140"," I want to capture."
"14190200","14191880"," I want to show you what I want to capture."
"14192100","14192260"," Okay. "
"14192940","14194280"," The move that I'm trying to capture."
"14195780","14196880"," I don't know."
"14197740","14198420"," This works. "
"14199980","14200980"," Like hold on."
"14201120","14202380"," I need to get out of a pen or something."
"14203320","14205640"," Like I want to capture this move here. "
"14205840","14208880"," Most of this and not get caught in this."
"14209240","14210720"," And I don't want to get caught in this."
"14211480","14213200"," And the same goes this way. "
"14213300","14214620"," I want to capture most of this move."
"14214620","14218060"," I don't want to buy in shorts here or puts down here."
"14218300","14221460"," I want to be or shorts over here. "
"14221900","14224280"," So you're going to see that squeeze here, right?"
"14225700","14227380"," And you'll see that squeeze here."
"14227460","14228880"," The same thing happens down here."
"14229320","14232840"," You'll start to see this capitulation moves down here. "
"14232920","14234340"," You'll start to see bears or bullsey."
"14234820","14235180"," Oh, God."
"14235540","14236240"," Lord Jesus. "
"14236760","14237040"," We're fucked."
"14237620","14238840"," We're not going to get anything here."
"14239180","14240640"," And so that's what I'm looking for. "
"14240740","14241920"," Some kind of sideways and down."
"14242480","14245060"," No matter what we're being shown right here right now."
"14245060","14246460"," It means nothing to me. "
"14246940","14247380"," Nothing."
"14248040","14251440"," The only thing that would mean anything to me if you wanted to if you wanted to squeeze me out."
"14251980","14253180"," I'll say exactly where it is. "
"14253540","14254520"," Say I squeeze me out."
"14256060","14257640"," Say exactly how you squeeze me out."
"14258420","14262000"," The only way you can squeeze me out is if you did something stupid like this. "
"14263180","14264320"," You did like this."
"14265040","14265900"," That would squeeze me out."
"14266900","14267800"," Something like that. "
"14267980","14268340"," I get fucked."
"14269760","14270940"," That move right there."
"14271540","14272380"," Totally fucked. "
"14273740","14275880"," But even then my puts are cheap."
"14276540","14278540"," They're like 10 cents, 12 cents, 20 cents."
"14279300","14281340"," They mean nothing as we trade trade. "
"14281560","14282720"," Or hopefully we trade this down."
"14284000","14285140"," So you might be asking me."
"14285700","14286400"," Well, then cap wire. "
"14286600","14287860"," It's taken this long today."
"14288560","14289940"," I'm just not day trading at this moment."
"14290280","14294000"," I'm working in the background on mechanics of this shit. "
"14294600","14295900"," So to be truthful with you."
"14295900","14298600"," I just had a monitor go out over here."
"14298760","14299600"," So I'm working on my monitor. "
"14300560","14303020"," I'm working on some other stuff we have."
"14303220","14309900"," I've got one, two, three computers going and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven monitors"
"14309900","14310460"," going."
"14310660","14312120"," And so I'm just trying to get this thing set up. "
"14312200","14317840"," And actually at some point today I have to turn the stream off and remove some shit around."
"14318880","14323220"," Physically move some stuff around so that they have a better view point of what's going on."
"14329530","14333070"," Spy pushing higher while apple and misfit are down. "
"14335830","14338110"," I'm able to make a new high of the day."
"14338410","14339050"," Yeah, exactly Josh."
"14342310","14343930"," Yeah, I'll get you guys. "
"14344170","14345010"," That's another thing I have to do."
"14345090","14346210"," So I've got discord rolling."

"14546040","14547160"," know they can mute their microphone."

"15350420","15353860"," President Macron, the French state should take a greater stake in EDF."
"15356000","15357560"," All right, sorry about that."

"15364860","15369940"," I do real estate on the side."
"15371260","15373080"," I don't know if you guys know that."

"15522230","15525450"," We'll see if the market can squeeze higher to 440 or not."
"15528810","15530950"," And we're going to talk about some real estate here."
"15530990","15532810"," So we'll see if we can squeeze higher. "
"15533210","15535410"," Look for a price target above of 440."
"15536130","15537810"," See the sellers are up here."
"15538650","15543970"," Looks like they're coming down currently right where we are at 437.75. See if the market can trade"
"15543970","15546290"," higher into the end of the day here. "
"15546330","15547610"," Or if the market's going to roll over."

"15571450","15573610"," Let's look at spy real quick."
"15573850","15574250"," Let's buy. "
"15574390","15575550"," We're going to look at the VIX real quick."
"15576550","15578670"," And we're getting a little bit of a bounce here."
"15578670","15580670"," If you look closely at this chart here. "
"15583320","15585800"," And we sold off down below, right?"
"15586080","15587980"," Bounce, bounce, and then we're traded lower."
"15588380","15591280"," Tagged a nice low down here at 2561."
"15591860","15595920"," We want to see continued selling of the VIX to keep going down. "
"15596320","15601520"," And hopefully this is not some kind of a consolidation trade higher here."
"15602660","15604200"," I'm short this market currently."
"15604200","15604940"," It's not ruled out. "
"15605000","15605600"," I'm going to Keith."
"15605960","15607940"," But only if it's useful and at the right moment."
"15608920","15609880"," And we'll continue. "
"15610120","15612180"," Well, not going to the VIX here, but looking at the spy."
"15612880","15613800"," I'm looking for."
"15614620","15622160"," A roll over here as we head into Friday. "
"15622800","15627900"," Some kind of a pretty severe selling as we trade lower here."
"15628260","15630280"," Now we are resistance across the market."
"15630440","15631860"," We've been a resistance here. "
"15632340","15636640"," We were here at resistance at starting at 436.53 or so."
"15637280","15640340"," And we are at resistance again above here at 438."
"15641200","15646460"," Supposedly, Spock Emmett is claiming that we should be able to trade as high as 440 today before we"
"15646460","15647360"," find some real resistance. "
"15647840","15650620"," They're also claiming that if we trade higher than 440."
"15651320","15652500"," Let's look at closer here."
"15653920","15659300"," If we're able to get above 440 today at some point, then that's very bullish. "
"15659540","15660100"," We break through."
"15661000","15663200"," What happens is we end up breaking through volatility."
"15664380","15668620"," And we have clear skies above at that point to take this much higher. "
"15668620","15671640"," And here would be the ultimate price target above at 450."
"15673180","15675100"," The price target if we can get above 440."
"15675860","15678980"," But anywhere that we are right where we are right now is all volatility. "
"15679640","15681920"," You can see that as it's been happening all day long."
"15682420","15685920"," Just lots of rotation in the market trying to get us higher."
"15686540","15687880"," We are at some resistance here. "
"15688000","15690340"," You can see this resistance point that we're at right now."
"15690760","15693660"," And we're just a big giant solid grind."
"15698270","15699510"," Just get eight up. "
"15699770","15701930"," Yeah, we'll talk about being a slumboard here in just a minute."
"15702030","15704090"," Okay, we're going to show you guys this."
"15704970","15707450"," If I own and flip 28 houses in my life. "
"15707570","15707970"," Oh, you did."
"15709810","15711390"," Janice has owned and flipped houses."
"15711670","15712650"," We'll look at two right now. "
"15714610","15716150"," You want to know how to make money."
"15716270","15717930"," We're going to teach you guys how to make money right now."
"15718730","15719790"," So here's the deal. "
"15719970","15720170"," Okay."
"15721190","15725390"," If you, if you, let's say you're, you're making some money and you're like, how do I make money?"
"15726090","15727450"," And you get a job."
"15728710","15732970"," And then you, I don't know, you get a job and then you get. "
"15735470","15738590"," Savings accounts and then you get yourself a 401k and then."
"15739070","15742910"," Eventually you find the stock market and you find a new way to make more money."
"15743190","15744450"," You found Bitcoin, whatever. "
"15745750","15747910"," It's, there's risk in that, right?"
"15748150","15750670"," So if you're a portfolio, you want to have a portfolio."

"15760270","15767550"," So if you get, so if you get, if you have a, your portfolio, right, you've got some money in"
"15767550","15768790"," the bank, right?"
"15768990","15771590"," The pay your girlfriend or your boyfriend because they're broken poor. "
"15772110","15775850"," And then you've got some money tied up in some real estate, right?"
"15776050","15777370"," Your first one is a home, right?"
"15777370","15778510"," Let's say you try to buy a home."
"15778910","15780930"," It's not a depreciative asset, right?"
"15781690","15782990"," And then you've got some money."
"15783170","15784770"," Let's say, save it up at a 401k or something. "
"15786150","15790810"," And you've got, you've taken out some risk with, or not too much risk, but Bitcoin or something"
"15790810","15791210"," like that."
"15791310","15793530"," Or an NFT, whatever it is, wherever your poison is, some gold."
"15794750","15795650"," Then you found the stock market. "
"15795950","15800510"," So you want to put some risk on to make high profits and then you want to protect those profits,"
"15800770","15800790"," right?"
"15800790","15808930"," If you take $100 and you wager it and you make $500, let's say, or you make $100 off that"
"15808930","15814050"," $100, you don't want to leave that hundred that you made in the stock market."
"15814050","15815470"," It's a high risk proposition."
"15816590","15818670"," It's not that you don't risk the first hundred again. "
"15819130","15822490"," It's that the money that you made, you want to put somewhere else that's a little less risky."
"15823050","15824610"," So how do I deal with that, right?"
"15825390","15827230"," So you're like, hey, Cap, what do you do with your money?"
"15827230","15832190"," So one of the things that I do with my money is I buy houses, right?"
"15832630","15836090"," I used to take on tenants and I don't do that anymore."
"15836270","15837230"," Too many problems with tenants. "
"15837910","15841970"," Well, if I first started with, I'd buy them, rehab them and then flip them."
"15842670","15849530"," And the taxes, the time, and the bullshit, now the cost of materials and the"
"15849530","15859510"," cost of, you know, you buy a house for"
"15859510","15864350"," $150 to $300,000 and then you're in a high-priced market."
"15865070","15867930"," And they try to do a rehab cost of 100 grand, 200 grand. "
"15868090","15870410"," They try to sell three, four, five, six, $700,000."
"15871190","15872390"," That's all fine and dandy."
"15873930","15877670"," But usually if you get, it's a couple of things you have to think about. "
"15877910","15883030"," And let's say the market turns on you and you're in a nice neighborhood, you're going to get"
"15883030","15883530"," fucked."
"15884090","15886370"," And I've seen it happen too many times, right?"
"15887290","15892230"," So my take on the real investing in real estate for me at least is I try to buy houses"
"15892230","15895350"," with cash and with cash money."
"15895610","15902970"," And then I try to fund, I use the fund flips or rehabs with hard money loans. "
"15903410","15907430"," So I don't know if you guys know about hard money loans, but I find a house."
"15907650","15908850"," I'm like, hey, I'm going to buy this house."
"15908850","15913030"," It's going to cost 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75 grand. "
"15913770","15917850"," And they will front me part of the rehab money."
"15918490","15920510"," And I have to have a rehab in a time frame."
"15921010","15923030"," You're like, hey, it's three months or six months. "
"15923470","15926490"," And then there's points that you pay them and you have to get the house on market."
"15926550","15927850"," You can't live in any of that kind of shit."
"15928570","15929310"," It's hard money loan. "
"15930110","15933230"," And the VIG starts at month, month, three months, six, whatever."
"15933530","15935190"," And they usually take 10 points or less."
"15935190","15936270"," It's your first deal. "
"15936370","15937570"," They might take 10 points off you."
"15937790","15942410"," If it's done multiple deals, it goes way down three to five points."
"15943330","15948430"," If you've done multiple deals or they know that you can make the money in a positive time frame. "
"15948650","15951030"," Anyways, all that shit noise and bullshit."
"15951330","15952750"," For me personally, I don't do that anymore."
"15952910","15959550"," Now what I do is I try to buy and hold and I try to buy and hold these houses"
"15959550","15963530"," and I don't rent them out to regular renters, too many problems for me at least. "
"15963530","15967910"," So what I do is I try to buy and hold and then turn them into Airbnb's."
"15968850","15970090"," Because they don't have to deal with the tenant."
"15970750","15975550"," I can unload the workload on to a housekeeper and a property manager. "
"15977330","15980350"," And I can kick these people out if I need to."
"15980910","15984250"," There's no, you don't have any rights if you're an Airbnb renter."
"15984390","15985990"," If I don't like, you can get the fuck on out, right?"
"15987770","15991610"," So for me, I don't have to rent out that often to make what I would make and rent. "
"15991610","15994270"," So that's my, that's my story at this point."
"15994490","15995230"," No more buying and flipping."
"15995730","15996650"," No more rentals. "
"15997170","15997690"," None of that shit."
"15998170","16000430"," Just Airbnb's Airbnb's."
"16000730","16005970"," And specifically if you're in a place like, if you're in a community like, let's say, Detroit or"
"16005970","16011330"," Cleveland or lots of places in Minnesota is a good place. "
"16011750","16012850"," Ohio is a good place."
"16014350","16019390"," Yeah, Minnesota, any kind of like up and coming neighborhoods or cities."
"16019970","16022190"," So if you look like an up and coming city, right?"
"16022190","16026030"," They're being gentrified or they're, or they're making a comeback in some way or shape or form. "
"16026210","16034050"," Usually they had a period 10, 20, 30 years, especially in the Rust Belt where they had decay, urban"
"16034050","16034330"," decay."
"16035110","16037530"," And these towns are reinventing themselves, these cities."
"16037530","16045430"," But within that, you find that there aren't a lot of options for, there's usually still industry in"
"16045430","16045810"," these places. "
"16046210","16049130"," Lots of engineers need places to stay."
"16049390","16053490"," There aren't a lot of options for business travelers to stay."
"16053690","16055890"," There aren't a lot of hotel options, nice hotel options. "
"16056790","16061430"," You'll find like an engineer will come to town that has to work on five or six gas stations and"
"16061430","16063430"," they need a long term stay, right?"
"16063950","16067830"," So Airbnb does this thing where they offer long term stays."
"16068150","16074310"," They offer one to three month rentals, almost like a sublet."
"16075370","16077410"," And there aren't a lot of hotels available. "
"16077830","16081890"," They're nice for an engineer, let's say to come to town and spend a month, three months."
"16082550","16087910"," Also, when people, let's say someone escapes a poor neighborhood, they get a college degree or they"
"16087910","16088290"," make it."
"16089410","16092650"," Let's say Hollywood is a joke, but let's make it out in Hollywood or some. "
"16094370","16097310"," And they want to come back to visit their family that still lives in these neighborhoods."
"16097330","16098590"," They don't really have options."
"16098590","16101310"," They have to travel to see family. "
"16101490","16105730"," So I buy these houses now and turn them into Airbnb's."
"16105910","16109290"," So you have an option somewhere nice to say secure."
"16109970","16110670"," It's pimped out. "
"16110730","16112470"," It's beautiful and that kind of stuff."
"16112570","16114490"," So we're going to look at a couple properties."
"16114650","16116130"," So my guy just called me and he said. "
"16117050","16118750"," So and this is another crazy thing."
"16119130","16123710"," The last for the last five years or so you could get great properties at auction."
"16124370","16131150"," Tax auctions and people upside down their taxes and said often would get properties at auction. "
"16131570","16135970"," But most of these towns are getting reinventing themselves."
"16136410","16140370"," You can't really get a decent house at auction anymore and specifically in Detroit."
"16141190","16142730"," Although that is changing. "
"16142730","16149490"," A lot of people in many communities around the U.S. have not paid their taxes during COVID."
"16150210","16155650"," And now they've, matter of fact, I just read an article that said that there's 16,000 homes coming"
"16155650","16157770"," into the auction this year for unpaid taxes."
"16158310","16165250"," So this year's this year's this year's tax auctions should be a good one, believe it or not. "
"16166930","16170090"," And you might say like why are you buying these houses and all that kind of stuff?"
"16170270","16171510"," Well, because it's real estate."
"16171510","16175410"," You buy real estate and you buy real."
"16175530","16177190"," I'm going to look a couple of these up right now. "
"16177250","16177770"," They just got offered."
"16178330","16180870"," So you buy real estate because it's a safer investment."
"16181110","16183590"," If you take care of the property, you renovate it properly. "
"16185170","16188430"," You put real, you put tenants or yourself in them, you live in them."
"16188790","16190410"," That's how never it's become gentrified."
"16190650","16192350"," You move there, you live in the house that you bought. "
"16193290","16195050"," I live in the city on a house that I bought."
"16196990","16197850"," Hold on a second here."
"16198670","16200350"," You have an active member of my community. "
"16201890","16202650"," See, does that work?"
"16202950","16203530"," Hold on a second here."
"16204230","16204890"," Just a second here."
"16204970","16205570"," Okay, five. "
"16206290","16206690"," I'm going to show."
"16206830","16211650"," So you say, why do you or I can't afford to live in an L.A. Because they still live"
"16211650","16212150"," in L.A., right?"
"16212270","16213130"," Lived in L.A. Santa Monica."
"16213750","16214230"," Lived in Vale. "
"16215090","16216690"," A bunch of other expensive places."
"16217230","16220950"," Let's see a young person and you want to start making money out there, right?"
"16221410","16227070"," Yeah, if you how this has been done since time immemorial is you find a place that is undervalued."
"16227070","16229110"," And you. "
"16230630","16233650"," You move to those places and you become a part of the community."
"16234250","16235470"," And then you."
"16237290","16238150"," Then you. "
"16239390","16240650"," You live there, right?"
"16240990","16243050"," And you start to buy properties."
"16243450","16243710"," They're cheap."
"16243950","16245050"," They're cheap. "
"16245290","16250690"," They're constantly where between like $10,000 and $100,000 between that sweat equity loans,"
"16251050","16251770"," whatever you can get."
"16251770","16256490"," From sources, Italy approves the gradual phasing out of COVID-19 restrictions."
"16258170","16259770"," And then four, five, seven. "
"16262290","16263930"," And this is how you build wealth."
"16264730","16268810"," You don't actually build wealth from the stock market, believe it or not."
"16269050","16270270"," Some people tell you that you do, but it's not. "
"16270490","16271350"," I'll tell you how you build wealth."
"16272110","16274870"," You build fucking wealth by owning real estate."
"16275970","16279330"," The more properties that you own, right, the more leverage that you have. "
"16279330","16281410"," And you upkeep them."
"16281550","16283130"," They generate income for you."
"16283270","16284110"," You get tax breaks. "
"16285770","16286790"," You want a property?"
"16286970","16287270"," You want an Airbnb?"
"16287750","16288690"," You can get a check from an Airbnb."
"16289450","16292630"," Let's say you're like, oh, I bought a, I bought a house for, let's say 10 grand."
"16292810","16296530"," I renovated for 30 and I sold it for 75, let's say, just say, right?"
"16296670","16298470"," See this quick payment of 35 grand. "
"16299030","16300770"," You had to wait two, three months to work it all out."
"16300970","16305130"," You end up getting a tax, big time taxes, 30% of that goes taxes."
"16305310","16306210"," You're left with 10, 20 grand. "
"16306810","16307450"," It's okay paycheck."
"16307450","16312630"," But if you get someone to pay you a thousand bucks a month for the next 10, 20 years, it's"
"16312630","16313530"," some serious money."
"16313930","16314810"," Okay, serious money. "
"16315190","16320830"," And even in Detroit, believe it or not, rents right now in Detroit are $900 to $1200 for a single"
"16320830","16322610"," family home, which is great."
"16323030","16323970"," It's outstanding."
"16324710","16328930"," Airbnb is making like $1,500 to $2,000 a month, depending on where they're located. "
"16329370","16330270"," It's pretty serious money."
"16330670","16332190"," So I'm going to show you guys."
"16334230","16338990"," I'm going to show you guys closing on my trades to attend this real estate seminar. "
"16339290","16339950"," So I'm going to show you guys."
"16340250","16344850"," So when you start doing this stuff, what happens is you end up meeting people, right?"
"16345030","16345790"," You end up meeting attorneys."
"16346150","16348890"," The government sets the publishing energy supply plan next week. "
"16349970","16350910"," You end up meeting."
"16351270","16355270"," Let's look at the UKPM Johnson seeking to reduce dependence on Russia."
"16356230","16357990"," We'll get a little bit of a roll over here. "
"16358550","16360330"," Tagged out at four, three, seven, nine, two."
"16360510","16362730"," We'll see if we can find some support here on."
"16363450","16366830"," So you can find some support down here on four, thirty six, eighty. "
"16367230","16368870"," See if we can make another move higher or not."
"16370470","16373550"," And we'll see if we'll trade down here and then then make this move higher."
"16373770","16376150"," Or does the market begin to roll over as we head into Friday?"
"16376750","16378730"," Now, so let's think about that. "
"16378770","16378910"," Okay."
"16379030","16383570"," Let's say you're a young guy out there or a woman and you're like, I can't make it."
"16383570","16386650"," I'm on Reddit anti-work and my job sucks. "
"16387009","16390509"," And I can't buy a house and I can't buy a car and I can't buy this and I can't"
"16390509","16390869"," buy that."
"16391369","16392610"," And it will is me, right?"
"16392910","16394630"," You can say that shit all you want all day long."
"16394990","16398430"," But the reality is for you to make it in this world, nobody's going to help you. "
"16398810","16402070"," Your job isn't, your parents can't."
"16402250","16403210"," They can, but they can't."
"16403310","16404790"," You know, most parents can't help you that much. "
"16405570","16407529"," Your girlfriend boyfriend, they're not going to help you."
"16407770","16410189"," You have to really literally pull your pants up."
"16410970","16413550"," And you're like, why can't?"
"16413550","16416890"," One of these places, you fucking can't. "
"16417070","16421130"," So, anyways, you meet these people and then there's properties that come offline."
"16421470","16422310"," They're not on the market."
"16423050","16426349"," And if you meet enough like attorneys, real estate agents, stuff like that, they call you up and"
"16426349","16427570"," say, hey, do you want to buy this?"
"16427770","16428790"," Do you know anybody that wants to buy this?"
"16429169","16429950"," So I just got a phone call. "
"16430570","16432910"," The guy said to me, hey, do you want to buy these two properties?"
"16434390","16438390"," And there's, I'll talk about this stuff later too, because sometimes what I can do is I'll buy, but"
"16438390","16440230"," not buy this property and then sell it to somebody else."
"16441009","16442290"," Okay, so another part of this business."
"16442290","16444490"," So, then we'll talk about that at a time. "
"16444669","16447110"," But for right now, these are the two properties that I was just offered."
"16447110","16447450"," Okay."
"16448150","16449029"," This is the first one. "
"16449669","16454550"," This is, uh, don't bother looking this up because there ain't a market."
"16454830","16456090"," I mean, nobody fucking buying this house."
"16456750","16457210"," All right. "
"16458810","16461630"," But this is 5236 Vancouver Street."
"16461770","16465750"," We should surely be expecting the results of the fence reverse replay facility usage."
"16467910","16469470"," 5236 Vancouver Street. "
"16469750","16470009"," Okay."
"16470730","16471450"," It's off market."
"16471450","16472630"," It got renovated. "
"16474150","16475930"," Uh, we'll look at it right now real quick."
"16477310","16478689"," Uh, there's some problems here."
"16478790","16480090"," No, first of all, this house got renovated. "
"16480770","16481009"," Okay."
"16481730","16482590"," That's a great yard."
"16483130","16487050"," Uh, it's actually in some, some newer pictures of the whole yard is fenced in. "
"16487750","16489849"," But there's some, there's some bad houses here."
"16490130","16491090"," It's a bad house right there."
"16491169","16491810"," It's all boarded up. "
"16492110","16493349"," That's like occupied house."
"16493570","16494529"," This is an occupied house."
"16494730","16495290"," That's good to see. "
"16495369","16496369"," You want to see stuff like that."
"16496669","16499450"," But all these you want to find out if these are scheduled for demolition."
"16500070","16503250"," Or if they're on the list for there's a rehab program in Detroit. "
"16503810","16505610"," Where they'll sell these houses in auction."
"16506169","16508250"," And then developers are coming in and develop this stuff."
"16508369","16510210"," So you want to find out if this is on the development list. "
"16510689","16511070"," Or not."
"16511790","16511869"," Right."
"16512130","16513110"," And there's more over here. "
"16513270","16513869"," Some of these are occupied."
"16514150","16517150"," You can always check by lawns if people are living in them or not."
"16517349","16518810"," Or people are taking care of them or not. "
"16519590","16521110"," Uh, this does not look occupied."
"16521430","16522050"," Neither does this."
"16522349","16524550"," But there's a positive to this house. "
"16524550","16524869"," Okay."
"16525650","16526290"," Wait."
"16526610","16529430"," And that is that downtown Detroit. "
"16530650","16531290"," Stop."
"16531930","16534310"," Downtown Detroit is right here."
"16535310","16537189"," And six counter parties take one spot. "
"16537529","16540349"," Six, six trillion dollars at the Fed's reverse repair operation."
"16540950","16542849"," And so this house has been renovated."
"16543550","16547290"," And I'm not going to tell you the story behind how this house became available. "
"16547290","16552869"," But this house probably could sell for right now."
"16552869","16556810"," Probably sell 35 to $55,000 in its current state."
"16557270","16561009"," I could probably buy this house today for anywhere from $10,000 to $30,000. "
"16561610","16562430"," No taxes out."
"16562570","16563750"," No water bills and all that stuff."
"16564450","16566610"," So anywhere from $10,000 to $30,000, I could buy this house. "
"16567410","16568029"," Put a renter in it."
"16569130","16572910"," And in three years, I'll have my money back at most one to three years."
"16573950","16576650"," One to three years, I'll have my investment paid back. "
"16576849","16578029"," And it'll just be free a free money."
"16578570","16581410"," Uh, free money from this point forward."
"16582490","16583450"," Which is kind of neat. "
"16583910","16585310"," So this house right here, I just got offered."
"16585570","16588470"," He says that Italy is ready to impose new restrictions."
"16588910","16590509"," If the COVID situation wasn't. "
"16590730","16593230"," Now see, see how this neighborhood kind of sucks right here."
"16593930","16594369"," Right."
"16594669","16599050"," So you want to find out if this neighborhood is on the master plan. "
"16599250","16600090"," Detroit has a master plan."
"16600189","16600910"," Is it going to come back?"
"16601390","16605369"," Because this house, if this neighborhood comes back, is going to be worth probably a hundred grand."
"16605970","16606410"," Okay. "
"16607130","16608150"," Easily hundred grand."
"16608189","16611910"," If this is, if this neighborhood is on that, that, that plan, I'm going to show you a neighborhood"
"16611910","16614150"," here that is on that plan."
"16614490","16617029"," So this neighborhood here and this house right here. "
"16617410","16618570"," See this neighborhood right here?"
"16618950","16620330"," This neighborhood is beautiful."
"16621869","16624410"," See how, see how this, this neighborhood."
"16625189","16628070"," Has actually been renovated, rejuvenated. "
"16628890","16630430"," People have bought and renovated."
"16631210","16637290"," This area is being, you can start to see that all these homes are well taken care of."
"16637830","16638110"," Right. "
"16638930","16641189"," And this is the neighborhood you want."
"16641369","16641509"," Right."
"16641730","16642890"," I want this neighborhood here. "
"16643290","16646290"," But to be honest, you don't want this neighborhood now."
"16646849","16650029"," You want this neighborhood before it becomes this."
"16650570","16654550"," So that when it becomes this, your property value goes through the roof. "
"16654730","16654810"," Right."
"16654930","16656390"," You double your investment."
"16656910","16657050"," Right. "
"16657509","16657869"," This is beautiful."
"16658849","16662090"," So my point behind you is this or behind it is this."
"16662689","16663750"," See this house right here?"
"16664509","16672730"," So this house right here had a house fire and the comps in this neighborhood are right around a"
"16672730","16675810"," hundred grand hundred two hundred thousand dollars, believe it or not. "
"16676650","16678490"," So this house had a house fire."
"16678830","16680590"," I was told the house fire was not that bad."
"16680950","16681770"," It didn't got it. "
"16682029","16683150"," It didn't blow through the roof."
"16683150","16685029"," You can't see smoke coming out of it anywhere."
"16685029","16687910"," Now the deal on this house is they just want out of it. "
"16688070","16691290"," This is another older person that just wants to get out."
"16691710","16696970"," The insurance is willing to pay fifteen thousand dollars towards the renovation of this house."
"16697509","16698849"," So I have to drive over here today. "
"16699189","16705250"," Take a look at this house on the interior and see how much it would cost to renovate this, even"
"16705250","16705910"," after the house fire."
"16706130","16712790"," So fifteen grand, maybe another ten to fifteen grand, hopefully, or as high as maybe thirty grand"
"16712790","16713470"," twenty thirty grand."
"16713470","16717810"," That's going to put me right at, it's going to put me at a buy price at like twenty thousand,"
"16718210","16720310"," maybe twenty thousand dollars at fifty. "
"16721009","16724509"," Costing like fifty and they can probably sell this house for a hundred thousand dollars."
"16724890","16726830"," So that's a quick fifty grand."
"16727330","16731029"," I'll probably walk away with thirty grand or something like that. "
"16731470","16734730"," But with that money, the twenty five grand plus six or fifteen."
"16734869","16737050"," I could probably put a GC right on site here."
"16737189","16738110"," We'll now check on it. "
"16738430","16741590"," Come back through and this is only going to make money over the years."
"16741590","16744790"," So there's the two houses that I'm looking at right now to buy."
"16747430","16753570"," Now, if you wanted something even cheaper than that, there's something called, now there's"
"16753570","16755070"," something called, what is it called?"
"16757270","16758750"," The Wayne County Tax Auction. "
"16768610","16774330"," Now, this Wayne County Tax Auction doesn't take place this year until October, September, October,"
"16774610","16775790"," it starts for twenty twenty two."
"16776150","16780250"," This is what you want right here, because there's no, there's nothing attached to it."
"16780310","16784170"," There's this other thing called building Detroit, where you can get a house for like five hundred"
"16784170","16784350"," bucks. "
"16784610","16788730"," Don't ever do that shit."
"16788730","16792350"," Dirt cheap, but like you got to bury your power lines, all kinds of fucking nonsense."
"16793010","16797050"," You just go here to this auction site and they'll add this show. "
"16797090","16799030"," They're going to probably add like twenty thousand properties to it."
"16799170","16801570"," And then you get a list and then you you bid on them."
"16801590","16803570"," You can get like a list for like twenty different properties. "
"16803930","16806190"," You bid on the drive around, find the house that you like."
"16808170","16811590"," And another thing that I do is if I find if I find people living in any of these houses,"
"16811590","16817210"," if they're occupied, I'll offer the owner to buy pay off their taxes and pay them money to get out"
"16817210","16817610"," of the house."
"16817610","16819290"," Let's say you were upside down. "
"16819390","16821150"," The state of the county was going to take your house."
"16821490","16822930"," Let's say you were upside down like ten grand."
"16823530","16828310"," I'd give you ten grand to pay your taxes off and give you another ten or twenty grand to move. "
"16829170","16833070"," So you have somewhere to go and your property taxes are paid off now for that."
"16833630","16837030"," That's another another work around and not even doing the auction."
"16837210","16838190"," That way it comes out of the auction. "
"16838870","16841570"," I don't have to bid anybody else and then I get the house."
"16842650","16845310"," And it's actually been lived in, so it usually needs less renovations."
"16848830","16849730"," So you get. "
"16856970","16858990"," Is the buyer liable for property back taxes?"
"16859150","16860010"," Good question, Mr. J."
"16860090","16860330"," Rambo."
"16860490","16863370"," So there's a bunch of stuff wrapped up on that."
"16863470","16863670"," Okay. "
"16863890","16867990"," So if you buy a house through the Wayne County tax auction."
"16869030","16873570"," You have to pay off the back taxes if there are any and you can search to find out if"
"16873570","16874010"," there are any."
"16874010","16875730"," And or, you know, I think it comes. "
"16875910","16877310"," No, no, I get that wrong."
"16877810","16883230"," If you buy it from the Detroit land bank, taxes are taken care of."
"16883390","16892970"," If you buy it from the from the Wayne County tax auction, the starting bid includes the old"
"16892970","16899770"," property taxes and you have to pay off the next year's property taxes in advance when you close in"
"16899770","16900130"," the house. "
"16902610","16907250"," Now, if you're buying a house like these that I'm going to try to buy, I just do a tax"
"16907250","16908130"," search on them."
"16908290","16909170"," You can do a tax search."
"16909350","16913150"," And then if, if there are any taxes owed, if it becomes a part of the negotiation, like, hey, I"
"16913150","16914170"," know you owe this much money. "
"16915230","16920570"," And you don't buy the house without the water bill because the water bill is attached to the home"
"16920570","16922930"," here in this county is really fucking crazy."
"16924590","16925490"," We move it up here."
"16926190","16926970"," Sweet Jesus. "
"16927210","16927510"," Look at that."
"16935200","16936160"," Just cranking."
"16937800","16942440"," Pumping on up to 438.03. Consolidation and another move higher. "
"16942780","16944360"," Squeeze higher to the melt up here."
"16945020","16949120"," 438.03. Yeah."
"16949300","16954440"," So what you're looking for is when you do the deal, they have to pay the taxes off. "
"16955400","16957760"," Or it's a part of the deal that you pay the taxes off."
"16960570","16964570"," One way or another, you try to get your, you don't close the deal ever without any, any"
"16964570","16966410"," encumbrances on the property."
"16966790","16969990"," And that has to do with type, type of title that you get where you get a warranty deed and"
"16969990","16971430"," your title, you don't ever, I don't do quick claims. "
"16972010","16973790"," Some people do if they're only going to be rentals."
"16974510","16978090"," They'll do quick claim deeds, but I'd only do warranty deeds on homes."
"16987120","16990740"," So if I live in New Jersey, how do I have a bunch of questions?"
"16991540","16992660"," Yeah, you bypass the auction. "
"16994700","16995940"," I bypass the auction."
"17004970","17009530"," Yeah, so like, so what I do is there's a bunch of different ways you can buy these houses."
"17009810","17017050"," The first one I do that my most successful one is when I get the list, you go to your"
"17017050","17018490"," county, wherever you live, right?"
"17018490","17020890"," Some, some places you can find them. "
"17020970","17030870"," You go to the first thing you do is you, you find the first thing you do into facts here."
"17031030","17035030"," Russia's Novak says the energy supplies from Russia are to remain stable."
"17036370","17043670"," So the first thing that you're doing here is, there is no, even with these squeezes, none of these"
"17043670","17045190"," calls are printing that fat. "
"17047850","17048450"," Spreads, baby."
"17048710","17050490"," It's the way spreads spreads."
"17050550","17051790"," Spreads are pretty fat. "
"17055110","17060930"," The, the first, the first thing you can do is you go to your, your county and you, or call"
"17060930","17065670"," your county and say, Hey, when do you have auctions because they'll have court step auctions."
"17066390","17067710"," Some counties only do court step options."
"17068970","17073650"," Some counties have an actual auction time of the year where they hold an auction event. "
"17073650","17074550"," Think of where you live."
"17075510","17076630"," And they'll give you the details."
"17077250","17081090"," Now, if they put a list out there, sometimes they ask you to have, you know, you have to have"
"17081090","17081550"," 10 grand. "
"17082050","17088390"," You put into escrow or 15 grand or 20 grand or a percentage or even depending upon the number of"
"17088390","17089530"," properties that you're going to bid on."
"17089650","17092050"," There's a bunch of different rules where you're bidding on houses."
"17093190","17098770"," What you want to be doing is you want to be looking for, we're going to scroll back over here. "
"17101060","17103480"," So you want to be looking for what you're looking for."
"17103600","17106640"," We have some resistance forming above it for 40 and for 39."
"17109340","17115160"," What you're looking for is you're looking for places where you can find cheap houses. "
"17115380","17118620"," So if you live in New Jersey, right, you have to find a neighborhood that's coming."
"17118860","17121240"," That's beaten down in a county that's beaten down."
"17121540","17123640"," If you live in New Jersey, you have to consider moving. "
"17124260","17128680"," If the Jersey's like ripping or whatever, if the real estate market's excellent there, you have to"
"17128680","17131320"," be willing to move, pick yourself up, move somewhere else."
"17132000","17137100"," If you're looking for just a rental in a different place, like let's say you're living in New"
"17137100","17140180"," Jersey, but you want to buy something to rent out to somebody else."
"17140820","17143660"," What you do is you find properties in a different city. "
"17143660","17148200"," And you can buy them through through ads."
"17148480","17152520"," They have Facebook groups to where we have properties already been rehabbed."
"17152680","17156900"," When I first started what I did was I went on Facebook, found a real estate group here in Detroit. "
"17157460","17159960"," I got some addresses."
"17160340","17163900"," I flew into Detroit and then I started to actually physically inspect them."
"17164300","17167380"," And then I signed a contract and bought houses, right?"
"17167900","17168960"," That's how I got started doing it. "
"17169720","17170960"," They were already rehabbed."
"17171000","17172240"," My first one was already rehabbed."
"17175360","17178620"," I picked up some 440 C's there at like 98 cents. "
"17178860","17179900"," They're up to $1.30 now."
"17181360","17184240"," But I think I'm going to cut a mousse here in just a minute trying to offset the cost of"
"17184240","17185060"," my puts that I'm in."
"17189440","17193940"," That's what you do. "
"17194080","17194520"," You take your money."
"17194680","17196700"," Now, if you let's say you're like, I'm poor, I'm broke, right?"
"17197160","17198760"," You have to have some kind of money."
"17198920","17206060"," You probably, if you were to buy a house and like dirt cheap, you probably need to have some form"
"17206060","17206820"," of cash. "
"17207620","17213780"," It has to be like, I don't know, somewhere around $10,000 to $50,000 to get started."
"17214580","17215980"," You're like, well, I don't have $10,000 to $50,000."
"17216300","17217040"," The truth is, right?"
"17217740","17220920"," You got to get like a partner and just say, just start banking their money. "
"17220920","17223580"," Or you make the money off the stock market."
"17224980","17228580"," And if you can come to the table with like 10 to 50 grand, you can get a hard money"
"17228580","17231380"," lender and they'll back you for the other half of that money."
"17232220","17235260"," And they'll back you to flip that house. "
"17245000","17247000"," So I just sold those calls real quick here."
"17253020","17254900"," That was a quick 25%."
"17266700","17268960"," All right, let me see what you guys are talking about in here. "
"17272710","17273970"," Get some weird shit going on."
"17273970","17275010"," All right."
"17278150","17278970"," Step it on toes. "
"17279250","17279970"," Yeah, yeah, of course."
"17281410","17282590"," How do you bypass an auction?"
"17283150","17286230"," Fuck, you get the list and you literally drive from house to house."
"17287270","17291150"," And if you see someone living in there, right, you try to get them out from underneath because"
"17291150","17292430"," they're going to get fucked one way or another. "
"17292970","17294250"," The county's going to fuck them."
"17294490","17296090"," So you're getting them out of the tax liabilities."
"17297130","17299390"," And then you're giving them a way to get out, right?"
"17299550","17302670"," You give them 10, 20 grand and they're like, hey, I can buy, you know, rent something somewhere"
"17302670","17302990"," else. "
"17304530","17308550"," I know if some people who pay this tax, then probably then suddenly you own the property kind of"
"17308550","17309830"," gray area, but it is what it is."
"17310150","17311410"," Yep, I've done that before."
"17311950","17313170"," Spy trying to catch a bid. "
"17313570","17314150"," It caught a bid."
"17314850","17318090"," It seems like it's possible to get taken out a bit of melt up."
"17318890","17319930"," How do you find the owner?"
"17320270","17321450"," How do I find the owner in a house?"
"17321730","17321770"," Right?"
"17322030","17322570"," That's a good question. "
"17324390","17328050"," Typically, typically, I don't, so there's two, there's a bunch of different ways you can find an"
"17328050","17328970"," owner in a house."
"17328970","17331730"," Typically, you go to a county tax payment."
"17332190","17332590"," I shouldn't. "
"17332650","17337130"," I don't know if I should tell you guys this stuff, but most counties, you can pay your property"
"17337130","17341990"," taxes on through a county website and you can usually just search the property."
"17342690","17344550"," You don't have to do an entire title search."
"17344570","17349370"," You just search the property number and it'll give you a way to pay the taxes and then it usually"
"17349370","17351230"," lists the actual owner of the property. "
"17352090","17356910"," If it's an LLC or a corporation that owns the property, you can then do an LLC search or a"
"17356910","17363530"," C-corp, S-corp search and then you find out who the, who the post that agent is for the"
"17363530","17364090"," owner of the home."
"17365850","17368270"," I should have sold those calls in after dollar thirty-two."
"17368450","17370470"," Action by New York and Dallas directors. "
"17372350","17373150"," I should have held those calls."
"17374050","17378010"," That's the fed discount rate approval is a formality following the Wednesday rate hike."
"17381090","17382850"," Oh, so what else you guys doing here?"
"17383410","17383910"," Let me see. "
"17387570","17389150"," Where's Tesla melting up to?"
"17389290","17390550"," Let's take a look."
"17390730","17391330"," Nowhere."
"17392610","17397230"," You're looking to, we talked about taking Tesla long over 86863. "
"17397230","17401530"," It has broken above and breached major resistance."
"17402330","17404370"," Next price target above would be 900."
"17405050","17407990"," You've got some other areas of concern here, 868. "
"17408790","17415350"," You've got 879 and then you've got 887 and then of course 897 here above."
"17415950","17422370"," It just smashed through a huge area of resistance that was down here between 860 and 863."
"17423090","17423670"," Good job, bulls. "
"17424450","17424930"," Woohoo."
"17431640","17433160"," What else you guys saying here?"
"17434060","17434860"," Wait a minute."
"17435700","17436080"," Tesla. "
"17441380","17442800"," What are you guys saying in here?"
"17449190","17453170"," Yeah, the property tax information, the name is public information, absolutely."
"17454030","17455790"," Yep, not hard to find."
"17456030","17458470"," Not hard to find who owns the house, not hard to find. "
"17459350","17464950"," Like, so another thing, another crazy thing, right?"
"17464950","17470830"," But some states, 100% on misfit calls, right on, right on in misfit calls."
"17471290","17475430"," On in most states."
"17475490","17479150"," In the Italian prime minister, sanctions on Russia can be strengthened further. "
"17480550","17486290"," A lot of call flow, waterfall coming in on flow algo right now."
"17486470","17489990"," You can see flow just pouring in right now."
"17489990","17497690"," XLV calls, misfit calls, apple calls, Tesla calls, spy calls, VA, QQQs and apple calls. "
"17498470","17499110"," So on."
"17500070","17500650"," Okay."
"17501590","17502230"," So on. "
"17504150","17509110"," Like this state here, water bills can be attached to an individual or to the house."
"17509610","17514510"," You have to in every county, wherever you're looking, you always want to know what kind of liens or"
"17514510","17514790"," debts."
"17515970","17522270"," We'll do a title search, but you always want to know, like, generally speaking, why people are"
"17522270","17522930"," losing their homes. "
"17523170","17527450"," It's typically from water bill, in this state, it's typically from water bills and tax bills."
"17527670","17530090"," They get underneath on them and they're fucking crazy."
"17530710","17532790"," They're like, haven't paid a water bill in 20, 30 years. "
"17533370","17536450"," They're upside down like $15,000, believe it or not, in a water bill."
"17538010","17543910"," Or they're upside down in their taxes, three, four, five years unpaid taxes."
"17545510","17547490"," And that's how they end up losing their homes. "
"17548190","17557230"," Now, when it comes to mortgage, when it comes to like a, like a, like a, like a four closure,"
"17557390","17557830"," a mortgage foreclosure."
"17558830","17560250"," I don't fuck with mortgage foreclosures."
"17560330","17560970"," I don't bother. "
"17561370","17561830"," They're still money."
"17562090","17564730"," They have the banks have to make the mortgage back."
"17564730","17566270"," And I'm not interested. "
"17566510","17568450"," There's not enough for me, at least."
"17568890","17570410"," There's not enough money in there."
"17570850","17575190"," I'm looking more for even a nice, and you'll find these tax auctions, even in nice neighborhoods. "
"17576490","17578550"," They're only looking for the taxes to be paid."
"17579510","17582490"," Then it becomes a bidding war amongst the buyers."
"17584190","17585710"," It's the only properties that I buy now. "
"17585990","17588150"," I buy, I should say I do a state buys."
"17589230","17595990"," From attorneys that have off market properties and I buy auction properties, pre auction or ad"
"17595990","17596230"," auction."
"17597110","17598870"," I find the best deals there. "
"17599270","17603730"," And I have the best gains from those properties."
"17604910","17612830"," And you know what else I feel like at the, my experience with auctions that are mortgage auctions,"
"17613330","17618770"," like, I feel like a lot of, I don't know if you have any auctions you guys have been to."
"17618930","17620510"," It doesn't matter what kind of auction it is. "
"17621130","17623550"," There's a lot of amateur bidders out there."
"17623870","17626410"," Seeing from Punchball Sherman saying the Senate."
"17628390","17632550"," Saying Schumer says they will amend the house bill next week and send it back to the house. "
"17634170","17643390"," And there are a lot of, so there are a lot of amateur bidders."
"17645290","17651150"," There are amateur bidders that overbid for properties and there are inside bidders trying to bid up"
"17651150","17652530"," bids on properties."
"17653210","17657430"," So if it's something we're through like a county, it tends not to happen. "
"17657730","17658450"," Sometimes it does."
"17658670","17664950"," Sometimes you'll find big real estate flippers that'll, that'll outbid an overbid for properties or"
"17664950","17666050"," they're trying to accumulate properties."
"17666530","17671270"," Deliver bid, but I've found less, less fucking fucking around in county auctions. "
"17678360","17681000"," Yeah, we stream daily."
"17681380","17682320"," I try to stream daily."
"17682940","17683820"," I use the stream daily. "
"17684160","17686680"," I'm just getting back into streaming daily again right now."
"17688440","17691820"," If you guys are just joining here, there's a few things you need to know."
"17691940","17693800"," Try to join us in the discord room. "
"17693800","17702000"," We stream or started to stream options flow as it comes in live within that discord."
"17702600","17704100"," So you might want to join us in the discord."
"17704340","17706400"," There's no nothing hidden behind a paywall here. "
"17706500","17707140"," Everything is free."
"17707840","17708840"," This is a free sub."
"17709540","17711420"," And then we live. "
"17711640","17717160"," We were live streaming every day and then I had some equipment upgrades that were not working out"
"17717160","17717480"," for me."
"17717600","17720480"," They're starting to work out for me, as you can see here now."
"17721320","17727860"," We'll take a look at the spy chart and then check in on the regular chart outside of book map. "
"17729080","17731280"," And see where we are."
"17731800","17736400"," So spot gamma this morning spot gamma report did put a ceiling at 440."
"17738540","17743460"," And they also made a note that if we trade higher than 440 here. "
"17744780","17747540"," That you should see volatility go away."
"17748040","17748840"," So we'll take a look here."
"17748840","17752700"," We're going to just go back to some of you are just joining us right now. "
"17752980","17755560"," We're going to go all the way back to the beginning of January here."
"17755640","17758460"," This is way back on January 4th, right."
"17758920","17761740"," And we started trading down into this negative channel here. "
"17761880","17763600"," These two thick white lines right here."
"17763660","17765060"," This one and this one."
"17765500","17770420"," And we traded out of bounds, of course, but generally speaking, this was the trend down. "
"17770960","17776420"," And even within these out, these out trading outside of these bounds right of this negative"
"17776420","17776820"," channel."
"17776820","17781000"," There were some some points of reference in this one right here."
"17781120","17785880"," We just broke out of just so you guys can see we finally broken out of. "
"17786480","17790540"," Our upper resistance of negative band here."
"17790560","17790820"," Okay."
"17791860","17793340"," Now within that. "
"17794060","17796040"," There is a volatility zone."
"17796200","17798520"," We're going to show I'm going to show you with this volatility zone is."
"17799000","17801000"," And that is right here. "
"17801000","17806260"," And so this is by a spot gamma note would be that in here."
"17807340","17808520"," This is volatility."
"17809300","17809580"," Okay. "
"17811200","17817720"," And we are in negative gamma down or we're negative gamma actually down or this whole thing is"
"17817720","17818200"," fucking negative."
"17818200","17819160"," Believe it or not."
"17820220","17823920"," But where this is a volatility zone right in this is this zone here. "
"17824480","17828640"," The spot cameras note today was that if we were able to break above."
"17829520","17831360"," Let's say you break above here."
"17832460","17836640"," And let's say consolidate think from blank thing saying seven projected rate hikes. "
"17836640","17838620"," We're not not so hawkish from the fed."
"17839380","17842480"," Yeah, they're not hawkish nothing about that statement yesterday was hawkish."
"17844620","17848540"," So if you break above this, this is this volatility zone here. "
"17848680","17851600"," You should be able to make the next leg up to 450."
"17852440","17852960"," Okay."
"17853880","17855300"," There's no volatility here. "
"17855460","17860380"," That would mean that rather than erratic movements up and down, you're going to get more."
"17860520","17861260"," It shouldn't go like this."
"17861420","17867640"," It would be more of a less volatility and more like a stretched out move higher over time to 450. "
"17868360","17869940"," This is when volatility is crushed."
"17870700","17875060"," This is when things get positive and we tend to move slower towards an upper target."
"17876180","17881740"," The violent moves tend to go away when you start to move into a more positive environment. "
"17881740","17883660"," You get out of a volatility zone."
"17884160","17885360"," So that's where we are today."
"17886020","17886780"," We'll get rid of that. "
"17887020","17888140"," We'll get rid of this here."
"17890380","17898400"," If we do meet this 440, we should see a pullback here anywhere from three four thirty six to four"
"17898400","17899520"," forty is volatility."
"17900040","17906640"," So even though we've traded this high, there is an expectation that we will get a roll over. "
"17907760","17913900"," In the market, even if it's just a pullback over time into Friday or even into Monday and then for"
"17913900","17915840"," the next leg, higher to 450."
"17927890","17928490"," All right."
"17928510","17930610"," So back to, let's bring this back up here. "
"17931570","17932270"," Get rid of charts."
"17932590","17933190"," We'll look at Tesla."
"17934210","17935150"," Tesla is still fighting around. "
"17935430","17936550"," See the resistance above here."
"17936670","17937850"," Tesla currently where we are."
"17938450","17943330"," Though there was a huge resistance here at eight sixty eight sixty one and the bulls just wrecked"
"17943330","17945630"," like a wrecking ball just destroyed. "
"17945630","17947130"," We'll actually look back."
"17947210","17948070"," Look at it back here."
"17948230","17949430"," You guys want a sexy chart?"
"17949490","17950090"," Here it is. "
"17951750","17952310"," Let's see."
"17952470","17954430"," Let's show you guys a nice sexy beautiful chart."

"18355640","18357580"," But if you guys want me to do this I have an intern. "
"18357880","18364960"," I have two interns I could get these interns to chart these and possibly even get you guys an"

"18396120","18397080"," Teach us please."
"18401000","18407840"," Yeah, I've got the I've got the script to auto load demonstrating view."
"18409640","18411040"," It's not really an indicator. "
"18411260","18411880"," I don't think it's an indicator."
"18411880","18413460"," The one that I've got is..."
"18413460","18416720"," At least PM Draghi see slowdown for Italian economy and no recession."
"18417380","18419960"," I have to cut and paste them in. "
"18420220","18424400"," So I have the script and then every morning I have to go in and I cut and paste them"
"18424400","18424440"," in."
"18424520","18428060"," It takes like five minutes to cut and paste them in every day."
"18429380","18431920"," But if you guys want me to do it every day I will. "
"18432080","18437660"," I've seen a US defense official saying US has anecdotal indications that Russian troop morale is"
"18437660","18438200"," flagging."
"18440160","18443540"," Draghi says no one in Europe expects there to be a recession this year."
"18443680","18445520"," But the economy will slow just to repeat that. "
"18445940","18452420"," 440 calls are now up to $1.64. They were trading down on the last move at like 98 cents."
"18452600","18453920"," So they're 50 cents at this point."
"18455200","18458000"," It's pretty good on those four four C's, four four zero C's. "
"18460760","18464500"," So we'll head back over to get out of the charts."
"18466080","18471440"," And we will go back to where the gamma or where the sellers are."
"18471840","18473140"," And they're hiding up here at 440. "
"18473580","18476360"," They're starting to show themselves above here."
"18476900","18479740"," We'll see if we can actually trade as high as 440."
"18480340","18481780"," We'll see if they can trade higher than 440. "
"18483300","18484940"," And you can see all these sellers."
"18485180","18486300"," You see all these sellers above here?"
"18486940","18488220"," Just nasty sellers."
"18488440","18489020"," Look at these sellers. "
"18492180","18494480"," Just nasty sellers above here."
"18495140","18497080"," These sellers want to take over here."
"18497180","18497940"," You can see them. "
"18498820","18500780"," Why you guys to see this above here?"
"18500960","18501960"," See this is called ice."
"18502860","18503280"," Right?"
"18503500","18505180"," All this white that you see above here."
"18505580","18508340"," This is a huge band of sellers. "
"18508860","18510820"," So we're going to take another look above here."
"18510860","18513660"," It says US high old funds C1 is about $6.5 billion."
"18514340","18516280"," See how high these sellers actually go. "
"18516280","18522980"," There won't be clear skies from here until you get above $4.42. So $4.42 on the spy."
"18533930","18534770"," Right on Garrett."
"18536090","18537690"," You guys are learning so much today. "
"18539250","18543270"," Yeah, I'll get a let's see if you're right boyfriend."
"18543610","18547650"," So tomorrow I'll be able to cut and paste discord links right now today."
"18547730","18548810"," I can't because I'm running. "
"18548810","18551650"," I'm running the bears."
"18551910","18554390"," I'm running discord on a different computer."
"18554950","18557650"," And if I have two instances of it running, it kicks me off. "
"18558150","18562770"," And I'm running options flow live options flow in the discord right now."
"18563810","18565630"," So I can't today."
"18565710","18569750"," But if anyone out there can grab a link to the discord and pop it in the YouTube chat. "
"18569890","18570530"," I would appreciate it."
"18571110","18576310"," And I will get a different username on discord to run it on another computer here tomorrow."
"18578930","18582830"," Now where's the tomorrow expectations was a question. "
"18583390","18586290"," You like to get a discord link in there for you guys."
"18586430","18587170"," I want you guys to do."
"18587330","18590070"," I want I do want you guys to know that. "
"18591270","18593970"," If you guys want you guys to know that we have a great trading community out there."
"18595090","18596410"," They're all trying to help each other."
"18596630","18597810"," Our trading community is wonderful. "
"18597830","18600710"," It's not a bunch of craft shit talkers."
"18600850","18602750"," No, everyone's trying to help everyone make money here."
"18603830","18607090"," People have different levels of experience trading and investing. "
"18610130","18612430"," And so they're all here trying to help you."
"18612510","18615870"," So if you're not in the discord, you probably want to join the discord at some point."
"18616530","18622750"," And find out how how we trade how we chart with traditional charting methods. "
"18622750","18629550"," And then we layer that with with volume market and volume profile."
"18629550","18633230"," And then we layer that with gamma and volatility levels."
"18633830","18639310"," And then we layer all of that on top of it with live book map with with the real buyers"
"18639310","18640450"," and real sellers are. "
"18641810","18646430"," Now we're making our way higher for 39.68 up to 440."
"18647010","18648090"," We'll keep this nice."
"18648310","18652010"," We'll expand this a little bit and see if we can make a nice beautiful touch above here. "
"18652010","18660330"," Looks like 439.98 and then slightly low at 439.91. We'll see if we can trade to this resistance"
"18660330","18663390"," point on the spy heading up to 440."
"18664150","18669210"," This morning when we started talking, we were talking about whether the Fed was hawkish or bullish."
"18669970","18675170"," And my take was that we're going to run this market up to not just all time high as a"
"18675170","18676670"," prop possibly create a bubble. "
"18676670","18679490"," There is one note I want to make within that."
"18680030","18687230"," And that is that there is talk on the street that they will make you comfortable to 450 thinking"
"18687230","18690430"," that we're going to create that bubble and then they're going to crash the market or bear market"
"18690430","18691150"," this thing again."
"18691590","18696890"," So just be conscious as we head towards 450 for a big turn in the market. "
"18697610","18700350"," So then, but I am very bullish in this market."
"18700530","18706010"," My stance is against that at this point due to what the FOMC said."
"18706130","18706750"," I've got one more. "
"18707630","18716490"," I'm in a meeting today and tomorrow about the macro viewpoint in the Fed's take on this where we're"
"18716490","18716690"," headed."
"18716890","18719330"," The market is headed for the next couple of years."
"18719530","18725030"," But if anything, if you go back and watch the original show this morning, I discussed what actually"
"18725030","18727570"," happened yesterday with with J-POW. "
"18727970","18731730"," And it was it was not what I think bulls or bears wanted to hear."
"18732270","18733590"," It was very loose."
"18734070","18737510"," And my view not hawkish in any way, shape or form. "
"18737510","18742630"," And the time is running out unless you slam a hammer down."
"18743050","18747750"," And the hammer, even thinking three to five percent is a hammer, it's not."
"18747750","18751410"," You're talking about a hammer that would need to be like 15 or 20 or 30 percent. "
"18751870","18753650"," And they're not going to do that."
"18753790","18755910"," So what does that mean for the market?"
"18756050","18757890"," It's going to get run up at this point."
"18758010","18762950"," And it's probably going to become a bubble at some point over the next two to three years. "
"18763350","18764950"," And it's probably tied to politics."
"18767770","18773310"," Now, trading the 439.85. We are looking at some resistance above here."
"18773310","18780670"," We did ricochet above here slightly lower at 439.87. We'll see if we can get one last push. "
"18781050","18784050"," Sometimes you'll get that rejection and then we will do that push."
"18784350","18787730"," And instead of just the pin strike, we'll make it slightly higher."
"18787950","18790030"," So we'll see if we can trade higher from 440. "
"18790610","18793810"," We'll see if this is the time when bulls take profit off the table."
"18794270","18798830"," Those 440 C's are now at $1.80. I think they were slightly higher there for just a moment."
"18801430","18803210"," Still seeing lots of calls coming. "
"18803390","18805430"," Lots of call flow coming into the market currently."
"18806210","18807710"," Nice trade higher today."
"18810430","18812050"," It's a total of seven hikes. "
"18812190","18817430"," You'll hear people use six hikes, but it's because we have one hike right now."
"18817950","18819450"," It's about one plus six."
"18819630","18824630"," So seven total currently, but it doesn't really matter what the hikes are at this point. "
"18824630","18831390"," The davishness from the Fed yesterday sets up inflation to rage."
"18832050","18836670"," The only people that will pay that price on inflation raging are poor people."
"18836990","18841930"," People like us that have money that you own a house or you have your money in the stock market. "
"18842390","18843990"," That will be the safe haven."
"18844830","18850330"," It's forced buying of the stock market so that you can outrun inflation basically."
"18850990","18853130"," So you can't save your money in a savings account. "
"18853130","18856370"," You can't save your money in a bank counter checking account."
"18856910","18858410"," You're not going to be safe in bonds."
"18858890","18862470"," In all honesty, the Fed is basically telling you out there. "
"18863130","18865390"," There's no way they're getting rid of inflation in the next nine months."
"18865570","18866730"," You can smoke and crack thinking that."
"18867070","18873030"," So what's going to happen is my money and your money has to be put into something riskier. "
"18873510","18876370"," And people with money have to put it into two places."
"18876410","18877590"," It's going to be into real estate."
"18878250","18881810"," I had a negative viewpoint on real estate leading you to the Fed. "
"18881810","18885190"," It says half dozen of Russian ships are off the coast now, Dessa."
"18885790","18889630"," I think you're going to see the real estate market currently blast off again."
"18890310","18894390"," And you will see the stock market blast off again for the next two to three years. "
"18894670","18896870"," I'd like to boost US bank net interest margins."
"18897530","18902190"," It is the only way the cash will outrun inflation is in the stock market."

"19061060","19063000"," Once you start to break above here. "
"19063180","19064520"," Even if you consolidate here."
"19064580","19066020"," This is your doorway to four fifty."

"19141360","19143120"," Let's Greg's bringing up a good point."
"19143320","19145760"," Cap respectfully disagree on the two to three year take."
"19146300","19147800"," There's never been an incident where all time. "
"19147900","19150640"," I was coming while Fed is doing it to team."
"19150860","19152560"," Even if you think the Fed's office plans."
"19152620","19153820"," It only does. "
"19154040","19155440"," So after a big pullback."
"19155780","19157060"," It's a very fair point."
"19157180","19158040"," So we're going to look at something. "
"19158060","19160760"," That's just the US officials saying the insurance that the US is sending."
"19161100","19162620"," Could help resist the Kiev siege."
"19163320","19165100"," Give me two seconds and bring something up for you guys. "

"19187300","19187760"," Okay. "
"19188960","19194300"," So those were like the news week article about the US saying Iran nuclear deal can be revived in"
"19194300","19194880"," the coming days."
"19194880","19195900"," Despite setbacks."
"19196000","19198720"," The link to that is available on the financial justice news feed. "
"19200400","19200880"," And."
"19202760","19204060"," This is a."
"19205400","19207200"," We're going to we're going to look at something here."
"19207460","19209740"," You guys don't always any guys don't always get this. "
"19210620","19211960"," New your composite."
"19213900","19215060"," New your composite."
"19216760","19218060"," Give me just a second. "
"19218180","19219260"," I got to go all the way back."
"19220600","19222560"," 1978 we're going to talk about something here."
"19224720","19225900"," We're going to go way back. "
"19226900","19228500"," So we're going to kind of a similar situation."
"19229400","19235560"," Not exactly but similar enough to at least see what to similar enough that you can see the impacts"
"19235560","19237660"," and effects of inflation."
"19238540","19240280"," You can see the impacts and effects. "
"19243000","19245200"," Let me just hold to be just a second here."
"19246560","19248540"," It's a good chart to watch."
"19248540","19248960"," Okay. "
"19250700","19252900"," And I'm going to show you guys something here."
"19254540","19258460"," Well, you guys to see something here."
"19258460","19258780"," Okay. "
"19260600","19262960"," It goes all the way into 83."
"19264200","19266360"," And we're going to talk about."
"19266820","19267760"," Hold on one second. "
"19267980","19269160"," The Fred inflation."
"19274400","19274800"," Okay."
"19275900","19279280"," And you you actually heard a you actually heard a."
"19282620","19288660"," You actually heard some people asking us to run away inflation run away wage wage is right. "
"19289040","19290300"," So we're going to do something right now."
"19290420","19292040"," We got to we have a chance right now to look at this."
"19292120","19295880"," So we're going to look at this because it's more involved in this than some of you guys understand. "
"19296140","19296280"," Okay."
"19296280","19299820"," So let's look at where inflation is right here."
"19299960","19300060"," Okay. "
"19300120","19300600"," This is real."
"19300600","19302360"," Not real, but we know it's fake."
"19302540","19303460"," We know it's higher than this. "
"19303880","19305800"," But I want you to see where it's that right here."
"19305800","19306060"," Okay."
"19306840","19307780"," And the point. "
"19308060","19308800"," Now I'm not a bear."
"19308920","19309280"," I'm a bull."
"19309560","19309680"," Okay. "
"19309760","19311560"," When you guys understand that I am a bull."
"19312000","19315380"," My point to you is this is that QT has not begun."
"19315920","19321880"," And the longer that you put QT off the longer that you don't increase rates aggressively. "
"19321880","19323540"," And there's some other things you got shortages."
"19324120","19327800"," We've got artificial shortages as well."
"19329120","19331620"," And we have too many people working right now. "
"19331780","19334640"," If you go back and check the news back in 1978."
"19334660","19335140"," Okay."
"19335940","19337020"," And there's another time as well. "
"19337400","19338360"," We're going to look back here."
"19338500","19338640"," Okay."
"19338960","19340480"," See this see this level right here. "
"19340640","19341560"," Well, you guys see this is level."
"19341900","19343180"," This is level right here."
"19343980","19348460"," And you can see it happening here back in 1973. "
"19348460","19350620"," And you can see it again take place."
"19351200","19354020"," Right around here in 1970 in October, 1978."
"19354280","19354840"," Okay. "
"19356500","19361180"," And I want you to see this movement down into 1983 back here."
"19361420","19362680"," July 1983."
"19363040","19363300"," It's critical. "
"19363640","19363760"," Okay."
"19364220","19367740"," And now we were we were we had huge rate increases."
"19368300","19369620"," We had no QT. "
"19369720","19369860"," Right."
"19370360","19370660"," We had to."
"19371480","19374940"," So we have we have a huge rate trying to control. "
"19375560","19376300"," Runaway inflation."
"19377000","19380520"," And right now we're right at the point of having runaway inflation in the market."
"19381140","19383800"," And now if you let's say you're saying, oh, we're going to get aggressive. "
"19384340","19385680"," Uh, uh, cap."
"19386020","19387360"," They're not aggressive right now."
"19387360","19392020"," And as the longer it takes for the longer it takes to get aggressive, right?"
"19392540","19395140"," And you start to say, well, they're going to do 5% or 10%. "
"19395140","19398520"," You would literally need like 30% by next year."
"19398640","19399960"," And you've got J."
"19399960","19406220"," I was saying, hey, inflation is going to be, uh, uh, controlled, uh, with 5% or 3 or 3"
"19406220","19411580"," or 30 B or 30 BPS 50 BPS, 150 BPS 30 BPS 300 PPS in nine months."
"19411680","19412520"," It's just not the case. "
"19412980","19414100"," Not for where we are."
"19414440","19414880"," Okay."
"19415060","19415720"," Not for where we are. "
"19415940","19420120"," I'm going to show you an example of this and what happened to the markets when this took place when"
"19420120","19425100"," you started when this inflation went up when you hear bears right now say, oh, we're fucked."
"19425560","19426820"," It's not that we're fucked."
"19426820","19428060"," The market's not fucked. "
"19428540","19429560"," Main streets fucked."
"19430180","19430520"," Difference."
"19431100","19433600"," Wall street's not fucked because what actually takes place. "
"19434140","19435680"," I'm going to show you the composite index."
"19436320","19438020"," This is 1978 right here."
"19438200","19438240"," Okay. "
"19439620","19444340"," And once you start to get this runaway inflation, this is now September, October, right?"
"19444700","19446520"," The market actually fucking rips."
"19447040","19447320"," Let's go."
"19447420","19451880"," This rip actually goes boom into January of 1980, right?"
"19452260","19454820"," Now you also have, uh, believe it or not. "
"19454820","19457020"," Jimmy Carter loses his second election."
"19457840","19460660"," You had a Reagan come in very similar, right?"
"19461500","19463100"," He doesn't want that to happen."
"19463300","19466460"," So what happens is if you want that second term, you're going to have to do what they did the"
"19466460","19467100"," same thing, right?"
"19467200","19471220"," Fox's program saying the house is now debating the bill to suspend normal trade relations with"
"19471220","19471980"," Russia and Belarus. "
"19472380","19475000"," And here's where the bubble comes in from up to 1980."
"19475280","19478460"," And then again, all the way up to 1983, right?"
"19478920","19481400"," And then it just keeps cranking and cranking."
"19481800","19485200"," And the market just moves uncontrollably into 1987. "
"19486180","19489700"," This is where the first real crash happens is in 1987 here."
"19490600","19490820"," Okay."
"19491560","19493420"," I want you to see these violent moves. "
"19493660","19496840"," I want you to see back here in 1978, right?"
"19497040","19498180"," This is pretty much where we are."
"19498300","19498520"," Excuse me."
"19498640","19501540"," This is December and October, right?"
"19502160","19503280"," And you want, I want you to see this. "
"19503340","19503560"," Okay."
"19503700","19504060"," This is October."
"19504480","19505380"," We're right about there. "
"19505380","19509140"," It is nice move down with the way climax up here and climax up here."
"19509260","19514080"," So if you talk about where is the market going ahead, I respectfully think the market is going to"
"19514080","19520620"," trade down to, let's say, the 2600 or 3600 or some kind of low number, right?"
"19520940","19526340"," As long as this inflation rages, you are going to see violent moves in the market and you will see"
"19526340","19528640"," the market move drastically higher."
"19529500","19529540"," Okay. "
"19530140","19532580"," So this process, this was with aggressive."
"19532580","19538640"," This is with aggressive rate increases in the market."
"19539080","19544580"," We had aggressive rate increases and all it did was pin it down enough so that it would spring even"
"19544580","19546320"," higher farther down the road. "
"19546800","19549720"," So I'm not seeing this bear trade much lower."
"19550020","19555640"," I'm actually going to say that I see the trade inflation raging and in the trade and the market"
"19555640","19559200"," actually going to extremes from this point."
"19572560","19575580"," Yeah, the balance sheet runoff is still talking about. "
"19575840","19579700"," And even the balance sheet runoff is not that big."
"19579920","19581840"," It's not as big as you think that it is."
"19582000","19586540"," I know that you think that it's big, but it's, and I realized that it's just like a rate hike,"
"19586820","19588280"," but you're talking about. "
"19588600","19593820"," We hope our rate hikes are so small right now that they're not big enough to be consequential."
"19593820","19598280"," If you were to say, hey, we're going to do QT and we're going to throw in 30 points."
"19598560","19600280"," I would say, fuck yeah, you have a good chance of it. "
"19600720","19601500"," Of stemming it."
"19601600","19603840"," If you said, hey, we're going to go after the oil producers."
"19604000","19605280"," We're going to go after the wheat producers. "
"19605820","19608260"," We're going to start to put price controls on."
"19608480","19609460"," I would say, yeah, you get a good chance."
"19610020","19610240"," Right. "
"19610480","19611540"," We're going to put price controls in the market."
"19611540","19615200"," If you said to me, hey, yeah, we're going to start laying people off at work and we're not going"
"19615200","19616660"," to raise, raise wages."
"19617200","19618280"," Let's say, yeah, you have a good chance. "
"19618440","19619940"," But what we're doing right now."
"19619940","19622460"," You're talking about price controls, right?"
"19622760","19626340"," Price controls have not worked and they're not going to work."
"19626740","19631000"," They're certainly not going to work with the stance of the Fed right now. "
"19631600","19633060"," So no, I don't see the trade lower."
"19633260","19639760"," I did see the trade lower into this FOMC meeting until I saw that this is being a can being"
"19639760","19640600"," kicked down the road."
"19640980","19642260"," I think it's tied to politics. "
"19642260","19648400"," I think what it is, is that you have politicians that don't want to make the mistakes of quote"
"19648400","19653280"," unquote, that Carter did."
"19653680","19656740"," I think that they want to keep the Senate and the presidency."
"19657180","19662380"," UK foreign minister trust is ready to trigger Brexit's article 16 before Northern Ireland"
"19662380","19662860"," elections. "
"19663420","19670440"," And so then I think what I think what truly happens is you see the Fed be lenient in in"
"19670440","19675580"," rate increases and I think that you're going to hear the QT talk about talk about for the next"
"19675580","19677780"," couple of years next two, three years."

"19790250","19793710"," Do I think that there's another move down to 405 or 390."
"19794130","19795190"," Yeah, I think they could be on the table."
"19795790","19800190"," It wouldn't shock me to see a move that's I wouldn't shock me to see this you know this move"
"19800190","19800470"," here. "
"19801430","19802530"," Right to 450."

"19804690","19806030"," They're like whoo, everything's great. "
"19806590","19810490"," And then we trade down to that 390 actually go lower at that point."
"19810810","19814130"," 395 let's say 396 or something like that."
"19814350","19815690"," Hold on. "
"19816310","19817390"," I could wait a minute here."
"19817630","19818410"," Hold on here."
"19819430","19820510"," You could see that move. "
"19820990","19822730"," I don't know why this is happening but."
"19823530","19824230"," All right."
"19826470","19827490"," Let's call it there. "
"19827930","19828830"," Bad drawing."
"19829890","19830330"," Okay."
"19831030","19833390"," But this move could still take place over here. "
"19833670","19837270"," And this could be the real bottom down here at 400 or 390 or whatever."
"19838050","19839930"," That you're you're roping in the bulls."
"19840230","19841870"," The one thing I made a comment on Twitter. "
"19842270","19844950"," I said, you can't trade this market ever again."
"19844950","19846410"," And I agree with this still in the statement."
"19846930","19850650"," You'll never be able to trade this market like you traded it in 2020 or 2021. "
"19850910","19852310"," You have to trade it to prices."
"19853190","19855110"," Now, not just by the dip and hold forever."
"19855490","19856470"," Do I think this can happen?"
"19856770","19856870"," Sure. "
"19856870","19861490"," Do I think after this though that we could trade this up to some stupid high."
"19862130","19865810"," Something like this, like literally to 510 of the year."
"19866050","19866410"," Yes. "
"19866950","19868470"," I think where we couldn't."
"19868630","19869610"," I think where we couldn't."
"19869990","19871290"," Before this FOMC. "
"19871290","19873030"," Yes, I absolutely think we can trade this higher."
"19873370","19875530"," 490 510 by end of year."
"19876310","19879950"," Do I think we certainly roll over up here at 450 lower?"
"19880610","19881130"," I don't know. "
"19881430","19883110"," On a smaller time frame."
"19883110","19886330"," I think we can trade down to 420 then make a move up to 450."
"19886590","19888890"," Yes, 430 hooked up to 450. "
"19889210","19889610"," Yes."
"19890370","19892370"," This is like different timescales, of course."
"19894790","19895810"," I see that. "
"19895970","19899570"," I don't see the one thing that I don't see is I don't see like."
"19900490","19901130"," I'm a bull."
"19901290","19902050"," You guys have to understand. "
"19902250","19903110"," I'm like bull bull."
"19903430","19904510"," I don't see this."
"19905450","19909410"," I know that some of you want to see this, but I don't see this in the next three weeks. "
"19910310","19911810"," Same from the US fund."
"19912110","19913090"," I don't think you guys do either."
"19913350","19913670"," Some of you do. "
"19913930","19916470"," Dollars in the week to March 16th."
"19916850","19918230"," Some of you see that in the next week."
"19918710","19920930"," You guys want all time highs like this week and I get it. "
"19921430","19922710"," I understand what your point is."
"19923670","19926350"," A little bit of a rollover currently in the spy."
"19927250","19929130"," A bit of profit taking coming off the table. "
"19929810","19931270"," Short picking up a little bit more."
"19931950","19934710"," You've also seeing as some golden ticket puts come in."
"19934710","19943010"," If you're inside of the discord, you can see the flow as it's coming in. "
"19943350","19944910"," A little bit of a rollover in the markets here."
"19945490","19948450"," You want to see this level get held and maintained."
"19949670","19949890"," You do. "
"19950210","19953510"," You can if you're a bull and you want to see it traded to close possibly."
"19954090","19955650"," We can charge something out here."
"19955970","19957890"," If you want to see something, some kind of a move. "
"19958650","19963010"," Maybe we trade down here and you're hoping for the last shorts to cover up in here."
"19963010","19963970"," That's always in the table."
"19963970","19966330"," It's possible that we could do that. "
"19966830","19971110"," That this could be a potential play that we make one more leg higher."
"19971310","19975470"," That four forty two four fifty to squeeze every last bear out here."
"19976950","19979730"," So keep that trade in mind as we head forward. "
"19981070","19982410"," But there could that we could have that."
"19982690","19984070"," Now why you to look on."
"19985310","19987770"," Why you to look on look here. "
"19987770","19988190"," Okay."
"19989170","19991910"," And I want you to look and see."
"19992850","19995730"," We're going to see if we can see if we can bring this closer. "
"19996910","19998290"," I need to see this here."
"19998970","20000310"," This is trade that's taking place."
"20000490","20002350"," Very broke above resistance here. "
"20002530","20002610"," Right."
"20003370","20007170"," Smashing above a four forty smashing back down some sellers."
"20007650","20010530"," But looking like we're finding some support we are currently. "
"20011270","20016910"," So be aware of that if you're a bear and whether we can hold this level and trade this higher."
"20016910","20018990"," If not, we'll look below for more."
"20019150","20023190"," We have another control point down below at four thirty six twenty six. "
"20024150","20024630"," Right."
"20024850","20026030"," And we'll look real quick."
"20026210","20029210"," We have that Vwap down here for four thirty six twenty eight. "
"20029570","20030050"," Right."
"20030290","20033590"," And so let's look real quick and see it's on a regular chart."
"20034250","20036730"," Four thirty six twenty eight is right down here. "
"20036730","20037010"," Right."
"20037430","20038870"," So you see it right down here."
"20039150","20040430"," Four twenty six Vwap. "
"20040610","20042410"," So maybe the trades back down."
"20042410","20044750"," Even if you broke up broached Vwap for a moment."
"20045270","20048110"," Bulls could try to take it higher again down here. "
"20048410","20049890"," You don't want to breach of this."
"20050290","20052130"," You want this to hold at some point."
"20052650","20055150"," And we are currently on some kind of a support level here. "
"20055790","20056930"," Right where we are right now."
"20057410","20058130"," Right where we are."
"20058130","20061610"," You don't want to see this breach or intraday right next hour half an hour. "
"20061890","20064310"," If you do see it come down here."
"20064630","20066770"," It's showing up where Vwap is."
"20067750","20070350"," Not interesting how these all tie into each other. "
"20070550","20070590"," Right."
"20071610","20072370"," All right."
"20072610","20073590"," So there you go. "
"20074010","20075450"," See if this gets held."
"20075850","20079390"," Keep your eye on the hero cumulative indicator."
"20079630","20080890"," Make sure it stays. "
"20082510","20084430"," Stays in line with the move higher."
"20084710","20087090"," If you see a divergence where it starts to head down."
"20087450","20089430"," You'll be looking for lower prices at this point. "
"20089450","20090890"," If that happens if not."
"20091070","20093070"," It continues the hero indicator."
"20093070","20095270"," The yellow line continues to head higher. "
"20095270","20099850"," You should see a bounce and another attempt to get higher into the close."
"20100990","20105910"," You'd be looking for the real high is four four three point four seven."
"20106170","20107230"," I don't know that we get there. "
"20107490","20111250"," Maybe we just get to four forty or above four forty into the bell."
"20111650","20113850"," So that we are actually out of a volatility zone."
"20120680","20122660"," There are I agree with you to Josh. "
"20148120","20150380"," Fed has to choose between recession and inflation."
"20150400","20151200"," They chose inflation."
"20151620","20152200"," Massy G."
"20152620","20153240"," You got it right. "
"20153680","20155060"," Massy G made a good point."
"20156020","20157700"," It's pretty fucking simple."
"20157700","20161440"," The Fed has to choose between recession and inflation. "
"20161840","20162040"," Yes."
"20162420","20164380"," Secretary of State Blinken is currently making some comments."
"20164600","20167220"," We have just posted out the video on the financial speed. "
"20167360","20168180"," If you want to have a watch along."
"20169120","20172700"," So Massy G made a point and it's it's very simplified."
"20173060","20176320"," It's easy to follow along with the Fed made a choice. "
"20177110","20177400"," Right."
"20177620","20180740"," And they made a choice between recession and inflation."
"20180820","20185640"," And I promise you you are going to see inflation fucking on fire. "
"20186380","20190960"," On fire in the longer that they allow inflation to rage."
"20191100","20192520"," Which that's what they're doing."
"20193100","20197880"," What they're what they're going to try to do is the temper inflation long enough for an election"
"20197880","20198440"," cycle. "
"20198760","20200060"," That's what's really happening."
"20200060","20205760"," To get through a midterm Senate and a mid term presidency election in 2024."
"20206180","20211140"," So you ask me a question like how can you say this is going to happen for two years or"
"20211140","20211640"," three years. "
"20211660","20212840"," I'm going to explain it to you."
"20213200","20220020"," They're going to try to pump the brakes just enough to temper inflation as inflation rages for the"
"20220020","20220900"," next two, three years."
"20221340","20226180"," All they're doing is postponing a recession at this point in the longer that they postpone it. "
"20226180","20229300"," The worse it's going to be down the road."
"20229600","20234980"," In that time period, we are going to trade into a fucking bubble like you've never seen."
"20235560","20241820"," Doesn't even matter if the Fed comes out and talks about or even adds QT in in May or in"
"20241820","20243380"," September or by December. "
"20243820","20247460"," The longer that they hold off, the bigger the hammer needs to be."
"20248060","20254140"," And if you start to go two years in three years, eventually something will break and that will that"
"20254140","20255640"," break will be not a recession."
"20255640","20259200"," As a matter of fact, postponing a recession, it could be even worse. "
"20259440","20266140"," It could be a market crash into a recession more so than even more so than even a recession."
"20266720","20272400"," Rather than pushing us in a recession, it would actually come into a bad moment in the market."
"20272780","20273620"," And I don't believe banks. "
"20273860","20274780"," I think they're greedy as fuck."
"20275160","20277340"," I think fucking banks will milk and milk this."
"20277720","20280040"," I think that producers will milk this. "
"20280220","20283500"," I think that commodities will milk this as long as they possibly can."
"20283500","20288240"," And you can see artificial inflation right now and shorted artificial shortages being created right"
"20288240","20288440"," now."
"20288620","20290620"," Nobody gives a fuck about the guy in the street. "
"20291320","20295500"," And it doesn't it looks like it looks like the Fed sold us sold you down the river for your"
"20295500","20296300"," main street person."
"20296300","20296680"," I'm sorry."
"20296920","20297620"," That's what it is. "
"20298460","20299260"," In my view."
"20299840","20301280"," I'm not trying to piss here about this."
"20301380","20303420"," Massey G is nailed the nailed it on the head. "
"20305620","20307520"," Had been nice with small fash cabos."
"20307520","20309620"," So there's a fed key."
"20311460","20312960"," Spy breaking down a bit. "
"20313320","20314680"," Exactly why it'll happen."
"20315220","20316120"," Okay, Greg Thomas."
"20316400","20317160"," Thanks for the thoughts cap. "
"20317500","20320260"," Don't think 70s inflation elect fits for multiple reasons earnings."
"20320520","20323220"," Next cues will not be good revisions down already started."
"20323560","20326160"," I agree with that as well, Greg revisions are down. "
"20326480","20330920"," But I think the revisions are down based upon a fed with a different viewpoint and outlook."
"20331400","20335140"," But I agree with you, Greg, what you will see is you'll see less products come out."
"20335140","20338080"," And you will see layoffs in these companies. "
"20338480","20342220"," And that will produce profits for for the stock market."
"20342480","20346380"," You will see that happen before you ever see the market roll over."
"20346440","20347740"," It'll take time for that to happen. "
"20347980","20349180"," But I agree with you, Greg on that."
"20349360","20352480"," I think it's just stretching it out is the point I'm trying to make."
"20353980","20357240"," Everyone will keep loading up and puts expecting the crash and downfall. "
"20357240","20358180"," It just won't come."
"20359100","20359960"," Dan saying LOL."
"20361080","20363820"," What are your odds on a new what are your odds on a new what?"
"20363820","20364740"," I missed this one. "
"20364920","20365320"," Hold on here."
"20366320","20370260"," What are your odds on a new low this year with your new bullish outlook?"
"20370660","20371840"," I think it's still there, Stephen."
"20372340","20373100"," I think we trade. "
"20373280","20374800"," I think we're right now we're trading the price."
"20375740","20376960"," I think you'll see more."
"20377080","20379040"," I'll think you're going to see volatility in the market now. "
"20379540","20382720"," Even if we trade higher, you're still still going to have volatility in the market."
"20383020","20384760"," I don't think it's going to be a straight shot up."
"20384880","20386760"," It's not like we've got QE anymore. "
"20387360","20392420"," But I think that you have jagged moves but ultimately leads towards a bubble currently."
"20396860","20398140"," Yep, Josh doesn't agree."
"20398480","20399000"," That's okay. "
"20404260","20404980"," Inverted yields."
"20407820","20417820"," Oh, if I say this"
"20417820","20420860"," week of the dollar and lower price, trust, hence lower inflation pressure."
"20421520","20422820"," Oh, yeah, they're going to trust me. "
"20422880","20424380"," They're going to do all they can to lower it."
"20425240","20426580"," They're going to do all they can."
"20427340","20428860"," They're going to do all they can. "
"20428860","20429620"," They're going to do all they can to lower it."
"20429680","20430040"," They're going to send."
"20430240","20431300"," They're going to sweet talk you. "
"20432240","20433580"," They're going to sweet talk you."
"20433780","20435480"," They're going to sweet talk you all day long."
"20435480","20437660"," They're going to tell you that the dollar is going to be lower. "
"20438480","20441960"," Matter of fact, the deal with China will you're watching the reinvestment in China."
"20441960","20446680"," That's to get goods cheaper into the U.S. But you're going to see parts of the market that they"
"20446680","20447900"," can't control prices in."
"20448540","20453400"," So you might even see you might even see main streeters spend less on durable goods. "
"20454000","20460540"," Spend less on on some discretionary spending, but they're going to get nailed by commodities."
"20460540","20462060"," They're going to get nailed where they can't."
"20462120","20463160"," They have to pay for gas. "
"20463540","20465620"," They have to pay for summary."
"20465780","20472900"," In matter of fact, you're seeing some rotation into a lot of stock the past week where people have"
"20472900","20473980"," to buy certain things."
"20474280","20476220"," Some people have to buy Apple phones, right?"
"20476380","20477740"," No matter what, believe it or not. "
"20478080","20481260"," So you're seeing a bid into big tech this week as well."
"20493350","20494570"," Can I post the discord?"
"20495010","20496990"," I can't at the moment post the disc."
"20497190","20497610"," Well, wait a minute. "
"20497650","20498690"," Let me see if I can hold on."
"20499430","20501070"," I might be able to post the discord."
"20501270","20501490"," Hold on. "
"20503800","20504960"," I can't at the moment."
"20505400","20506700"," I will be able to tomorrow."
"20507100","20510880"," Maybe someone out there can post Josh or your wife's boyfriend might be able to post the link to"
"20510880","20511220"," the discord. "
"20511520","20516680"," If not, I will have the ability right now because of the way that the system is set up."
"20517220","20522060"," But I will ensure that tomorrow I can post the discord link for you in the YouTube chat."
"20522700","20524100"," They probably don't want anybody in there. "
"20524520","20524820"," I'm just kidding."
"20526220","20528860"," Lincoln says Russia may be planning a chemical weapon attack."
"20528860","20529720"," A recession. "
"20530360","20531060"," Fuck me."
"20531260","20532200"," We were looking at a recession."
"20532840","20538040"," We were looking at a recession from a tightening right now to T right now. "
"20538220","20540620"," We were looking even if it was a minor one for two, three years."
"20541280","20543480"," But the longer that it gets pushed off, right?"
"20544160","20549300"," The longer that it gets pushed off the market, you can't put your money anywhere to fight or to"
"20549300","20549700"," beat inflation."
"20550380","20553220"," So you're being forced into investing in the stock market. "
"20553680","20558300"," You're being forced into it, not you, but like somebody with money is being forced to buy real"
"20558300","20564620"," estate, to outpace inflation, and to outpace savings accounts, outpace rates."
"20565580","20566740"," There is nowhere to hide."
"20566980","20568380"," So you have to buy the stock market. "
"20568560","20569020"," You don't have a choice."
"20569520","20570940"," That's basically what they're telling you."
"20571800","20573340"," That's my viewpoint right now. "
"20573420","20574520"," This has only been two days."
"20574780","20576320"," I have some more research to do."
"20576820","20580800"," But from all in all where we are right now, I was not expecting that fed it out yesterday. "
"20581340","20586140"," The Russian economy is in free for nice Russian economies in free fall."
"20586140","20587120"," Fuck yeah."
"20589680","20591260"," Another thing to look forward to. "
"20591760","20594260"," There should be you should see a ceasefire."
"20595200","20596580"," I haven't told you guys this yet."
"20597520","20603060"," There are some estimates coming out that you should see a ceasefire in Ukraine when the next three"
"20603060","20606580"," weeks that should bolster markets as well. "
"20606840","20607840"," So mark that on your calendars."
"20608140","20608240"," Okay."
"20608660","20613120"," Mark Captain Jim James telling you it's March 17th. "
"20613120","20613380"," Okay."
"20613840","20619460"," Within the next three, but by mid April, you will see a ceasefire and a cessation."
"20620060","20623560"," I don't know if it's if it's Ukraine folding. "
"20624040","20626080"," I don't know if it's a peace deal."
"20626480","20630720"," But the idea is that there will be one within the next three weeks."
"20631260","20633500"," So keep that mark that on your calendars out there. "
"20633760","20635820"," Come back and tell me I was wrong in three weeks."
"20636260","20637300"," Say cap, you were wrong."
"20644270","20645950"," Hey, Josh, thanks for doing that, brother. "
"20651410","20653570"," It doesn't matter if it is it doesn't matter."
"20653710","20659170"," So the longer that they wait, right, the seven rate hikes won't be enough."
"20660370","20663850"," If they were going to throw the hammer down, they would have already thrown it down. "
"20664150","20667810"," The fact that they're not throwing the hammer down right now, right?"
"20668730","20673230"," Shows that they are it starts to it's like cumulative over time."
"20673370","20679310"," You can't just raise by 0.2 or 25 BPS can't raise by 50 BPS."
"20679310","20683530"," You have to start raising like percentage points percentage points. "
"20683650","20687290"," You guys understand that like it's it's as time passes."
"20687910","20690350"," It's not enough, right?"
"20690810","20694450"," The feds already admitted that they should have cut it off a while ago."
"20694790","20700130"," And so they're passing the buck and there has to be a reason why they're passing the buck. "
"20700350","20704190"," You have to remember that the fed to an extent is a political appointment."
"20704390","20708890"," So there's politics behind it saying we don't want this right now."
"20708890","20709650"," Right?"
"20709810","20713350"," There's politicians are saying, fuck, if we go in a recession right now, we're going to lose the"
"20713350","20714610"," midterms and we're going to lose the presidency. "
"20715210","20715850"," So what do we do?"
"20716590","20717150"," I promise."
"20717150","20719250"," I promise Jay Powell and Yellen, right?"
"20719410","20723590"," That if you just keep us in office, which I would expect that of both parties, this has nothing to"
"20723590","20724830"," do with political party."
"20725050","20726590"," It would have been Republican would do the same shit. "
"20726970","20728030"," Democrats, same shit."
"20728150","20731550"," It's all about power, power and money and greed."
"20732550","20736150"," If the party doesn't matter, get the party out of your head right there. "
"20736230","20737590"," It's all about power and money."
"20737590","20742330"," So what they're going to promise is, hey, look, what we'll do is just get us the Senate, get us"
"20742330","20743310"," the second presidency."
"20743710","20747070"," And because I'm a lame duck, I promise I'll put the hammer down for my last four years. "
"20747070","20748990"," And it doesn't matter because we're already in power anyways."
"20749290","20749890"," That's the promise."
"20751330","20755910"," There's a reason why we're not doing it right now and I'm telling you what the reason is. "
"20756070","20757470"," The reason is because of power."
"20758690","20761730"," It's all it is greed and power, greed, power, money."
"20762230","20764170"," Remember that greed, power and money. "
"20765110","20766390"," It's always is."
"20773820","20776460"," They want to crash the economy with greed reset."
"20776660","20777100"," No, they don't. "
"20777120","20778200"," They just want to fucking make money."
"20778860","20779760"," It's always about money."
"20782160","20785460"," Secretary of State Blinken says China is refusing to condemn Ukraine. "
"20786040","20790940"," You condemn Ukraine aggression and seeking to portray itself as a nuclear arbiter."
"20791920","20796030"," A little bit of a roll over here in the spy."
"20796030","20801530"," Blinken says China has responsibility to use its influence on President Putin to defend"
"20801530","20802930"," international rules on principles. "
"20804830","20807950"," Blinken says we will not hesitate to impose costs on China."
"20812480","20813860"," Yeah, 20,000."
"20814260","20818280"," Well, so you guys, let's talk about that, Massey. "
"20818560","20821260"," So I saw 7,000."
"20830960","20832220"," You'll never do that."
"20836800","20838060"," 20,000 people died. "
"20838380","20839220"," Russians have died."
"20839380","20839440"," Yeah."
"20839760","20847360"," If one of the weird things says fine, we'll make clear to you that China will bear responsibility"
"20847360","20848500"," for any actions. "
"20848780","20850320"," It takes to support Russia's aggression."
"20854700","20855460"," Do that."
"20855820","20856680"," How are BPS raises?"
"20857820","20859560"," Well, even if you did, it's not going to be enough. "
"20859820","20860440"," That's the problem."
"20861600","20862500"," It's not going to be enough."
"20864340","20866440"," The 20,000 Russians dead. "
"20866680","20870640"," You know, I've heard all kinds of arguments against our four, like they throw in their conscripts"
"20870640","20872980"," first, and this is how they fight and all that kind of stuff."
"20873380","20876840"," Telling you guys what modern warfare has changed a lot."
"20876860","20881440"," And when you have two modern armies fighting each other, like modern with a will to fight. "
"20882960","20884880"," We haven't seen fighting like that."
"20885080","20888560"," Blinken says the U.S. is concerned China is considering age to Russia."
"20888560","20893420"," And quote unquote first world countries and they are concerned that China is considering directly"
"20893420","20895320"," assisting Russia with military equipment. "
"20896040","20898860"," In a long time, you got people you have people up there."
"20898980","20901120"," They're like, Oh, well, rack this and Iraq that Afghanistan."
"20901120","20901980"," I'm like, Bullshit. "
"20902620","20904600"," I'm like a Fallujah one, two and three."
"20905380","20908920"," You saw that kind of fighting for brief moments in time."
"20909200","20914980"," If you think if we had had Fallujah one, two or three, I have not seen any meaningful efforts by"
"20914980","20917620"," Russia to bring war to a conclusion through diplomacy. "
"20918420","20921620"," If you've seen Fallujah one, two and three right away."
"20923760","20924560"," Consistently persistently."
"20925080","20926600"," The one side would give up immediately. "
"20926940","20933260"," If that was happening to us for weeks on end, you would eventually see a ceasefire."
"20933780","20934580"," One side or the other."
"20934700","20940620"," I don't know if the ceasefire will be Ukraine or Russia, but you will see it one way or another. "
"20940900","20942800"," No matter what Russia says, you will see it."
"20942800","20945540"," Yeah, let's say Ukraine wins or tradition."
"20945660","20947440"," Lincoln says Putin's remark yesterday. "
"20947660","20950300"," Suggest he is moving in the opposite direction from diplomacy."
"20951600","20953940"," Yeah, we started it as we have Putin says."
"20954140","20954600"," I don't give a fuck. "
"20954700","20956080"," I'm going to put the meat grinder on."
"20956380","20961860"," I promise you that that meat grinder can get uglier than it's ever been for most modern militaries."
"20962340","20963260"," You guys were there. "
"20963460","20965940"," So you saw that they were saying that they sent drones."
"20966700","20968200"," The US said they sent a hundred drones."
"20968780","20970020"," It's not a hundred drones. "
"20970020","20978280"," It's like they sent like the drone systems have like six to 12 drones in each system."
"20978340","20980740"," So the US basically just sent."
"20981300","20983800"," I think it was like six. "
"20984000","20990280"," It was either 600 to 900 killed drones over to Ukraine."
"20990740","20991420"," It's insane."
"20992420","20995160"," It could decimate the Russian military. "
"20995160","21000260"," Now I'm not giving it to Ukraine or Russia to win, but the escalation and what this war is going"
"21000260","21001500"," to what can happen in this war."
"21002640","21007340"," You're talking about grinding a military down to dust and that includes Russians."
"21009380","21015580"," But they'll be forced between the economy and the resolution of the military conflict in itself and"
"21015580","21019000"," the kind of support that's now going into Ukraine. "
"21019860","21020900"," Wasn't a hundred drones."
"21021080","21022260"," It was like six or seven hundred."
"21022260","21023900"," No one touched on that. "
"21024180","21026700"," They were actual systems and not the actual drones."
"21027300","21029520"," Each system has like six to seven hundred."
"21029720","21032240"," He's like three long drones in a tube. "
"21032440","21035100"," You just set about three dollars and twenty one cents a gallon."
"21035580","21037080"," And you shoot them like a mortar."
"21038060","21039680"," You shoot these drones off like a mortar. "
"21039980","21040600"," It's like a flare."
"21040980","21046400"," You pop it off and it shoots off and then you've got an operator or navigator that navigates."
"21063180","21065500"," And I'm on a I'm on puts right now. "
"21066100","21067100"," I'm holding puts."

"21112960","21113740"," I don't know. "
"21119260","21122100"," We still are seeing at this time."

"21140620","21141800"," when past month or two."
"21143740","21149320"," Still seeing the hero indicator positive looks like keeps touching lower than works. "
"21149320","21151660"," It's way back up to the CVD cell line."
"21154570","21160630"," You're going to also look for more capitulation into Friday due to the put roll off."
"21160830","21168370"," There should be a nice play from the Friday close into the Monday open once all of those puts roll"
"21168370","21169390"," off as well. "
"21191600","21195260"," Currently two thirty three in the afternoon two thirty four in the afternoon."

"21238460","21242880"," Just want to see a close above this yellow line right here."
"21242880","21247760"," Basically the white line not the yellow line but somewhere down here right somewhere above four"
"21247760","21249640"," thirty six or so you want to see that close. "

"21261100","21264920"," this higher breakout of this channel."
"21265100","21266160"," We don't think we can break out of this channel. "
"21266520","21269780"," I think you roll this here but if you are a bull you do want to see a close above"
"21269780","21270400"," four forty."
"21270400","21272200"," It's out of the volatility zone."
"21272940","21275320"," It gives you new breath into four fifty. "
"21275920","21277420"," Personally I don't see that happening."
"21277920","21280420"," I see let me see if I can bring this back over here."
"21283190","21288430"," I see a roll over here to some extent into Friday and then the trade to pick back up on"

"21303330","21306590"," Yeah so I feel like super duper bullish you want to see a close above four forty. "
"21307130","21310090"," This is volatility in this there this zone here."
"21311170","21315570"," I still see that the roll over and then find new sport takes some profit off the table."
"21315570","21321530"," And then you also see this trade restart back up on Monday. "
"21321550","21326610"," We get more puts closing on Friday's OpEx."
"21335510","21340350"," You guys want to see Tesla just grinding higher baby."

"21373200","21374420"," This is good to see."
"21374960","21378140"," We talked earlier about this four thirty six number right."
"21378240","21380960"," This is that line in the sand four thirty six sixty. "
"21381080","21382260"," This is also the VWOP."
"21382460","21384960"," You could trade below it briefly and then pop back up."
"21385280","21388880"," This is really the buy the fucking dip kind of the zone right that we know about. "
"21388880","21391720"," And even if we just stay in this area here."
"21392280","21394680"," This is positive for the bulls over time."
"21395300","21402080"," The one thing the one or the trade higher to four fifty though does not begin until you get above"
"21402080","21402860"," four forty. "

"21512970","21513570"," The next trade up."
"21513570","21515570"," The next leg up to four fifty is on Monday."
"21516290","21518570"," And it could possibly because of how FMC. "
"21519430","21520690"," And OPEC or excuse me."
"21520910","21522690"," Because of where OpEx was this month."
"21523170","21524370"," And where the end of the month is. "
"21524970","21528630"," The trade to four fifty is probably on the Monday on this Monday coming up."
"21528910","21531830"," Or on April 1st."
"21532250","21532910"," Somewhere in there. "

"21555050","21556770"," And then Johnny's got Zim X."
"21556870","21563900"," The key on Twitter is take the money off the table and then trade above it."
"21564300","21565600"," You guys know when you're here. "
"21565860","21566240"," So like."
"21568880","21571360"," So when I talk to you guys about stuff here we'll go."
"21572000","21573020"," I'm going to show you guys some real good. "
"21573020","21574160"," I'm gonna let murder load up."
"21574260","21575200"," I wanna show you guys something, okay?"
"21576220","21577820"," Let's, wait, talk about this a lot."
"21578700","21580700"," Okay, so let's just look at something here, okay?"
"21585400","21587320"," So if you're a bull or a bear, it doesn't matter. "
"21588640","21594700"," You take the trade, if you know where the levels are, if you know, because we know we have a"
"21594700","21597900"," book map, we know where the levels are, we can see where the levels are."
"21598360","21601800"," You would take the trade from here to here as a bull, and then you take your money and run."
"21601800","21607740"," And then if you're a bull, you'd wait to pick it back up again above here, right?"
"21607920","21609580"," And then you take it to here, right?"
"21609780","21613460"," And then you pick it up again up here, right?"
"21614220","21616300"," So you're in, you're out, you take your money and you run. "
"21616780","21619260"," If you're a bear, the same thing holds true."
"21619800","21622480"," If you start to see a rejection here, right?"
"21622700","21626100"," You can then take this trade down from here, right?"
"21628020","21632360"," Have stops on, this is for bulls and bears, but you don't want to be, you want to be picking"
"21632360","21638040"," up and dropping off trades in these, in between support and resistance levels, or you look on major"
"21638040","21639700"," support and resistance levels."
"21639700","21643180"," So let's look at a major support and resistance level, right?"
"21643900","21648780"," So we know at a more macro scale that we have some resistance here. "
"21648880","21651560"," We're coming into resistance here, right?"
"21651740","21655380"," So this was the trade over four days, three days, four days."
"21656540","21659100"," Right, on a larger, on a more larger trade, right?"
"21659600","21660440"," That's what it was, right?"
"21660740","21662280"," So you should be taking profit here."
"21662860","21666840"," And then if you're looking for the next trade, if you look as a bull, if you're looking for the"
"21666840","21675660"," next trade, you're gonna be looking for this consolidation and then the next leg up to 450. "
"21676420","21678940"," The consolidation could be a day, could be two days."
"21679080","21682640"," If you think we're gonna go straight at 450, it's possible, but generally it doesn't happen like"
"21682640","21682800"," that."
"21683040","21683880"," Same thing on the way down. "
"21684280","21690120"," Whenever you're reversing, the market's reversing, you'll have that same, when we trade down, it's"
"21690120","21693920"," three, four days down, five days down, then it's three days up, right?"
"21694760","21697440"," And same thing here, market is reversing right now."
"21697820","21701980"," You're gonna look for some moments of consolidation and then your next leg up to 450."
"21703980","21707780"," And so when you're asking about Twitter, yeah, you take the money off the table on Twitter right"
"21707780","21708000"," now. "
"21708440","21712480"," And if we're gonna make the next leg up, you're gonna wait for this consolidation and you'll leg up"
"21712480","21713400"," on Twitter as well."
"21716860","21719520"," So we'll do, we're gonna do MR&E, right?"
"21719720","21722340"," MR Sony, pull out of here."
"21723780","21725540"," Oops, nope, hold on here. "
"21726280","21729440"," All right, so we're gonna now, so we're gonna get murder real quick."
"21730020","21731280"," MERS got room to run."
"21732380","21737000"," Nice support on Merck's diesel April future, set about $3.48 a gallon. "
"21737760","21739220"," More sellers than buyers currently right now."
"21739420","21742740"," Hero indicator is negative, but it is on some kind of support."
"21743400","21747180"," Major support on MR&E right now, Moderna is 166. "
"21750900","21754020"," We'll look a little bit lower here, 162."
"21759660","21761300"," Hold on a sec, we'll look at something else."
"21761840","21762300"," Hold on a second here. "
"21763880","21766120"," This stream is sponsored by Ticksright."
"21766660","21771020"," Ticksright allows you to actually hear water flowing futures, forex and stock instruments."
"21771020","21773040"," I mean, a lot of sellers that are on Merck's. "
"21773300","21774200"," Ticksright don't count."
"21774540","21775180"," That's a tough one."
"21776780","21778740"," Not a lot of support in here in Merck-Durna. "
"21779600","21782960"," Lots of sellers above on Merck-Durna, 180."
"21784000","21786180"," This is all volatility on Merck-Durna."
"21789060","21791120"," What do I have to say about Merck-Durna?"
"21792580","21799140"," You know what I like about Merck-Durna is that they're claiming that there's another shot needed. "
"21803960","21805240"," Let me get a second here."
"21808620","21812580"," I mean, it looks bullish is all held, doesn't it?"
"21814340","21816120"," I would say that it's news-driven."
"21817300","21823760"," I would say to squeeze higher here, you want to break above 173 or so or 180, that you're going"
"21823760","21825440"," to need a new, you're going to need news to drop. "
"21825680","21831680"," I like the idea of the consolidation from January 19th to where we are right now."
"21831680","21834700"," It does look bullish on a chart to squeeze higher."
"21835220","21837980"," You do have almost the double top right here. "
"21838400","21844940"," If you were to look at this on, if you were to look at Merck-Durna a different way, it"
"21844940","21848740"," does look like a second correction is in store for it."
"21849040","21852460"," There's a bear trading this of a second leg down."
"21853020","21854400"," So you're just looking for news. "
"21854740","21860280"," If you don't get the news that, hey, we're doing that fourth shot for everybody, you would see"
"21860280","21864700"," another corrective move down, something like, I'll try to post this for you right now."
"21868060","21870380"," I guess I can hear."
"21871000","21872660"," So be the first corrective move. "
"21875520","21877620"," And then another move down right here."
"21880190","21882530"," We will show you this one right here."
"21882610","21883210"," This is MRNA. "
"21884350","21886390"," And you'd have one move down, right?"
"21886790","21887070"," Push higher."
"21888010","21892130"," You could even get a news-driven moment where it trades higher here."
"21892510","21893830"," Breaks through you squeeze higher. "
"21894330","21895310"," Hey, we're getting a fourth shot."
"21896190","21898290"," I don't know if this was that move already."
"21898810","21899830"," Let's say it trades higher here. "
"21900070","21904050"," But then you would continue on with the corrective movement over time."
"21905530","21907470"," It looks like you already had it though back here."
"21907930","21909270"," 497, 1, 2, 3."
"21909990","21914430"," Yeah, at least in the main term, you could look for a squeeze here. "
"21914530","21914810"," It's possible."
"21915670","21916330"," It's possible."
"21916790","21919050"," This is actually what had happened right here. "
"21920470","21922690"," This is your first corrective movement."
"21922930","21923370"," It's even larger."
"21925270","21926190"," The tough one. "
"21926950","21928290"," MRNA is a tough one."
"21928530","21929910"," I would say it's all news-driven."
"21930590","21930710"," Beautiful. "
"21931070","21931450"," Look at that move."
"21932050","21933010"," Bam, bam, bam."
"21933710","21937090"," Correction over on MRNA is a fair take. "
"21938090","21939810"," You've got no support underneath down here."
"21940790","21941350"," None."
"21942070","21942350"," No support. "
"21943110","21944210"," This does look bullish."
"21944670","21946950"," I'm not following MRNA right now."
"21946950","21952670"," But I would say that this is completely dependent upon some kind of news dropping for MRNA. "
"21952750","21953870"," Nice chart, actually."
"21954610","21955810"," This looks over to me."
"21956570","21958510"," You broke this negative channel. "
"21958970","21959690"," You're trading higher."
"21960090","21961950"," You've got some resistance above here, of course."
"21962670","21963210"," Trapped sellers. "
"21963950","21965950"," You can do another level above here."
"21967050","21968950"," Another one of Trapped sellers."
"21970450","21971250"," Next level, 228. "
"21972290","21973910"," And then next level, of course."
"21976450","21976850"," 255."
"21978490","21980350"," And next level above here. "
"21981070","21985530"," So you want to be looking for support down here."
"21986970","21987690"," So what do you do?"
"21987930","21989390"," You see the sellers here, right?"
"21989550","21990770"," Sellers are here because they're Trapped."
"21991550","21993490"," So what you do is you take the money and run here. "
"21993970","21997590"," You wait for us to trade above this zone that we're on."
"21998050","22001330"," You're going to look for, look at the chart again, right?"
"22001590","22002250"," You can see this here."
"22004590","22009690"," So right here at 181.45, you pick the trade back up again at 181. "
"22010250","22015950"," And you then take it to 176 or so, right where we are."
"22016250","22018250"," As you can see these sellers, see these sellers here."
"22021790","22023110"," See all this right here, right?"
"22024430","22025950"," Please just get me out of this trade. "
"22026770","22029910"," This white ice right here, these are the sellers are starting to step in."
"22030250","22031450"," And they come in heavy at 180."
"22032690","22034610"," So there's some people on board to go higher. "
"22034610","22035290"," That's good to see."
"22036170","22038310"," And so you take this trade a second time."
"22038470","22043130"," If you get above 180, your next target above would be 228 or so. "
"22043850","22045530"," And then 255, we can look higher."
"22045930","22047370"," See where the next level is."
"22047750","22051710"," You have some sellers at 200, normal and natural for that. "
"22052730","22055330"," And then right up here, I said 228."

"23135800","23141420"," White House Press Secretary Sarkis stating it is a high concern of the U.S. that China may provide"
"23141420","23143080"," to Russia with military equipment."
"23162600","23163380"," All right."
"23163560","23164380"," We're going to talk about something here. "
"23164460","23166900"," Just be conscious of something here as we..."
"23166900","23169620"," As this is happening right now, can we be careful here?"
"23170300","23175940"," So I'm paying attention to the options changed as we trade."
"23176760","23182060"," So in the background, you guys don't see me, but I have a screener here where I just have the"
"23182060","23186080"," options chain open for the spy all day long."
"23187180","23189480"," I want you to see this move here, okay?"
"23190320","23192580"," This right here is a liquidation break. "
"23194700","23197340"," And there's two sides to liquidation breaks."
"23197820","23201720"," The first one would be to hold on..."
"23201720","23203740"," This is almost an efficient expedition, right?"
"23204260","23209280"," It will end up trading higher again, but when you see these liquidation breaks, there's two things"
"23209280","23209900"," to think about."
"23212460","23214380"," There are a few things to think about. "
"23219740","23223440"," Why are they happening and when are they happening and what the importance is of them?"
"23225360","23232960"," What you'll see is HFTs and you'll see algorithms that will try to shake you out of your positions."
"23235080","23237520"," Now it depends on where it is in the day, right?"
"23238920","23246000"," Now it also matters when it happens if it's in a accumulation distribution phase."
"23246720","23253240"," Not only will they try to break you out of this, but right now today, this liquidation event right"
"23253240","23261360"," here, this break, there's one difference between this break and any from earlier this afternoon. "
"23264730","23269330"," And I just watched calls go from, I think they were up at $1.85 or something."
"23270130","23277390"," It might have been close to $2 and they just broke from $2.43. So in your own trading, if"
"23277390","23279910"," you're out there, these are 440Cs expiring on Friday."
"23282830","23289190"," So the key point though is because of where we are right now and this sell-off real quick, I"
"23289190","23291590"," want to bring this up on another chart here. "
"23291810","23294270"," This is an important thing as a trader for you to understand."
"23295330","23296810"," Some of you do and some of you don't."
"23299310","23307190"," So you might see, you might see a move down and not see much premium leave, an option. "
"23309630","23312230"," This liquidation break here is small."
"23313670","23314430"," Real small."
"23314670","23315770"," This move right here is small. "
"23316070","23320530"," It's tiny, but this one right here is small."
"23321470","23322590"," There's two things you need to know about this."
"23323210","23329590"," First thing you need to know about this is you shouldn't lose 25% or 30% of the value"
"23329590","23333930"," of that option with a break like this at that price. "
"23334090","23334410"," It was like $1."
"23334650","23336730"," I think we've even got $2 at one point."
"23336970","23343390"," But when you start to see breaks that are whacking premium out of call options, it's showing that"
"23343390","23347050"," you're getting into this, hey, we're going to hand some off to this guy and we're going to hand"
"23347050","23349850"," some off to this guy over here and some off to this guy over here and we're going to take"
"23349850","23354430"," money and run means that less buyers are showing up right now for those options. "
"23355030","23356850"," Okay, let's just be careful."
"23357030","23364470"," It's not like you're consolidating and more buyers are stepping in propping up the underlying value"
"23364470","23365350"," of the option that you got."
"23366810","23368010"," The conscience of that. "
"23368470","23372410"," If you see a liquidation break like this in early trading and we're heading in a direction, though,"
"23372590","23375090"," what you'll see is like a steep selloff."
"23375190","23378350"," It's typically deeper and like way deeper."
"23379230","23383950"," When you see them like this, hold because they'll typically come flying back up at some point. "
"23384490","23386470"," Some, though, we've only been down this far."
"23387030","23392490"," Does make me think that call holders are selling at this point."
"23392650","23393910"," Just be aware of that as we move forward. "
"23394030","23398350"," A little bit different makeup is a little bit different than usual."
"23406890","23408930"," Be aware of that as we trade forward here."
"23409830","23417410"," The importance of the different types of liquidation breaks and what they mean in the underlying in"
"23417410","23423070"," the background, especially if you're seeing it in the value of your stocks. "
"23424210","23425690"," You guys all understand that out there?"
"23429190","23430070"," Oh, yeah."
"23430750","23432470"," Dan, I'm holding puts right now."
"23432830","23434290"," I'm holding puts. "
"23434830","23436170"," I ain't fucking sound shit."
"23436750","23437370"," I'm buying the call."
"23437590","23440110"," I'm buying calls and holding them for brief periods. "
"23440850","23442730"," But I'm fucking short here."
"23443370","23445450"," I believe the run up here."
"23445450","23448710"," I just think that we're like we talked about it. "
"23448810","23450910"," Are we at the start of the finish of a leg up or down?"
"23451230","23452470"," We're at the finish of a leg up."
"23452770","23454190"," Or at least for at least for the time being."
"23454950","23456990"," Whether you like that or don't want to hear that or not. "
"23457790","23459370"," I don't care that you couldn't get in."
"23460170","23462030"," I don't care that you didn't buy the bottom."
"23462830","23463470"," I don't. "
"23464070","23465090"," I bought the bottom."
"23465410","23471590"," So I, you know, if you didn't, if you only bought calls today, if you haven't bought calls in the"
"23471590","23474530"," last three or four days, what the fuck do I have to say to you?"
"23474530","23474590"," Yeah."
"23474890","23476010"," I don't know what to say to you guys. "
"23478390","23482290"," But if you're like just starting to buy calls now and you want to see forty five hundred right now."
"23483370","23487050"," You can be in and out because the market's probably going to roll over a little bit."
"23488910","23489910"," I shouldn't be that nasty. "
"23489930","23493630"," I'm not trying to be that I'm trying to be being a prick saying I'm not."
"23493750","23494810"," I don't mean to be like that."
"23496190","23499570"," Just be conscious that profit taking is happening right now. "
"23508180","23512280"," Is it against listening and make this prettier for you?"
"23520620","23522420"," Just spread this out a little bit for you here."
"23528430","23530170"," Remember that number I talked to you about down here."
"23530970","23531370"," 43662. "
"23540730","23547590"," If you're a barrier looking for trade down into 43694 or so, maybe slightly lower"
"23547590","23550950"," one here."
"23553720","23555640"," You're looking for that trade might be slightly lower."

"23564560","23568680"," And you could also be looking for 43598 as well if you're a bear."
"23569700","23577920"," If you're a bull, my only fear, you can trade these right now, but the only one I warn you"
"23577920","23582360"," of is right where we are right now in the market that I'm watching now."
"23582480","23589000"," The 440Cs are not out of $1.14. $1.13. So just be there losing value like crazy. "
"23589340","23591320"," It's not just the trade down here."
"23592020","23596300"," It's also the number of people interested in calls."
"23597680","23598380"," Just be conscious. "
"23599740","23602460"," We have it's 314 power hour."
"23603540","23606360"," The bulls are hoping for some kind of a squeeze in the close."
"23609620","23611700"," Let's see if they can have one more dip to buy. "
"23612520","23617600"," Bears currently are looking to short this down to at least 43683, possibly 43598."
"23618340","23620100"," Bears would really like to see half the day."
"23620280","23622200"," Get half the day to give them back, right?"
"23622760","23624600"," Matter of fact, I don't think I can measure on this. "
"23625120","23626240"," Can I measure on this?"
"23629830","23631050"," There's some things about."
"23631850","23634990"," Let's do a retracement real quick."
"23639220","23648520"," Yeah, so 50% retracement of the day would be 43659. "
"23649300","23652780"," So if the bears can take half that back, they'd be happy."
"23654800","23656160"," You guys want to show you that?"
"23657620","23658480"," Hold on here."
"23663500","23665520"," You can do it from either side, no matter. "
"23668780","23670540"," No matter where you click it from."
"23671620","23672680"," I'm just looking at the day."
"23673060","23675400"," You can see the day started somewhere down in here. "
"23678160","23685360"," Let's say the low of the day was 43318 and 50% of the day."
"23685960","23687720"," This is my line over here."
"23688320","23690460"," This line should actually be like this. "
"23692460","23694860"," Something more like this is more appropriate."
"23699560","23700460"," Right there."
"23700960","23711900"," And lo and behold, 50% from peak to trough is roughly down here, 43665"
"23711900","23712520"," or so. "
"23714840","23716560"," So do I think we're going there?"
"23717260","23717660"," I don't know."
"23718900","23721220"," But there's a chance we trade down over here."
"23721900","23722420"," It's not guaranteed. "
"23723300","23725100"," We could make this smooth."
"23725200","23731460"," If you see shorts closed into tomorrow to Thursday, we try to do like the creepy crawly up the wall"
"23731460","23733020"," in terms of doing this creepy crawly."
"23733740","23735280"," Do this kind of creepy crawly thing. "
"23737360","23741620"," Then we do this creepy crawly thing all up in there and you get the numbers that you're looking"
"23741620","23741880"," for."
"23743400","23746360"," That's probably 30% chance of that happening."
"23748800","23749760"," Maybe 20%. "
"23753780","23761520"," High probability that we have something more like a failure somewhere in here and then I move down"
"23761520","23761840"," lower."
"23762700","23767080"," And then you can try to make this trade higher or it fails one more time and just keeps trading"
"23767080","23767740"," lower down here."
"23768820","23769780"," Something like that. "
"23776360","23779080"," I don't like that the premium is kicking out on the calls."
"23779080","23780760"," I assume the people are taking profit here."
"23782080","23783540"," We can do the creepy crawly thing at the top. "
"23783780","23784380"," We'll take a look at it."
"23798280","23799200"," See if this can hold."
"23811100","23812460"," My puts are finally green. "
"23816580","23817780"," You guys are hilarious."
"23820300","23821360"," Check Baba."
"23821480","23822340"," Yeah, I can check Baba, bro. "
"23824420","23826720"," Alright, Josh, I'm sorry, bro."
"23827680","23828980"," What did I miss, Josh?"
"23829260","23831320"," I'll do AMC and GME right now."
"23832280","23834920"," Keep bugging me because the fucking stream keeps going. "
"23835480","23839660"," The fucking stream keeps going so fast that I can't get back and look at what you guys are wanting"
"23839660","23840060"," me to do."
"23840420","23841360"," Let's do Baba real quick."
"23847710","23848470"," I got your brother. "
"23848810","23850070"," I'm not trying to not do them for you."
"23850190","23850850"," Oh, shit."
"23852870","23853610"," Baba, baby. "
"23857370","23857930"," That's crazy."
"23858250","23864170"," I was reading all those news stories about, uh, I was reading all those news stories."
"23865250","23867450"," Matter of fact, Spock Emma had a video. "
"23868310","23873530"," I forget his name, but they just put out a video recently where the guy was like, my only exposure"
"23873530","23875630"," to equities was emerging markets in China."
"23876070","23876970"," And he's like, I sold."
"23879830","23881450"," He's like, just sold. "
"23883330","23890270"," Whatever Spock Emma's last video, if you watch the whole entire thing, the guy, uh, the guy fucking"
"23890270","23890530"," sold."
"23891310","23892250"," It was fucking hilarious."
"23895170","23896130"," Smart guy too. "
"23897490","23899410"," So let's see what Baba was doing."
"23902210","23905750"," Yeah, look at that fucking giant gap on Baba."
"23907110","23908270"," Sit on the cusp. "
"23908970","23910770"," Ain't shit down there either, is there?"
"23911270","23911570"," Look at that."
"23912410","23914110"," Yeah, fill that gap down below."
"23914350","23917770"," The US House has votes to revoke the more trade status with Russia. "
"23918330","23922910"," The House votes on the trade relations with Russia is ongoing, but the US House does have the votes"
"23922910","23925090"," to revoke normal trade status with Russia."
"23925870","23927610"," Let's look at it over time here."
"23929390","23930710"," Mixed bag right now. "
"23933470","23938050"," Looks like you got support down at 95.32. Seems reasonable."
"23940650","23943630"," If I had to guess on Baba, I would say consolidation."
"23945610","23947990"," If I had to guess consolidation, then I move higher. "
"23949250","23952570"," Let me bring up my chart real quick."
"23960700","23962640"," I'm not seeing the..."
"23962640","23964020"," I mean, I'm seeing some sellers here."
"23964120","23968100"," You got 40,000 sellers to 36, 4361 to 404. "
"23969800","23971520"," We're at 414 sellers."
"23973500","23974580"," We bring up a chart."
"23976420","23977080"," Hold on here. "
"23979020","23980080"," Okay, so Baba."
"23980960","23982080"," Here is Baba."
"23983960","23985730"," There's one good thing to say about..."
"23986100","23988600"," I mean, the one scary thing about Baba is right. "
"23990320","23993320"," I mean, this is that same classic..."
"23995220","23996100"," It's like a Baba."
"23997740","23999580"," Man, it looks like it's already done."
"24000260","24000460"," It's thing. "
"24000680","24001880"," Baba got fucked up, man."
"24002040","24002740"," Look at that shit."
"24003720","24004840"," Look at that. "
"24006440","24007400"," Just savage."
"24009560","24011160"," Just straight savage."
"24013260","24013740"," God. "
"24014820","24018540"," A larger time frame."
"24020020","24021200"," Okay, so Baba."
"24022740","24026080"," The one good thing you want to see, you want to look at is..."
"24026080","24027200"," I want you guys to look at is..."
"24027200","24027820"," Do you see this right here?"
"24028460","24030400"," This is nice volume down here, okay?"
"24030940","24032380"," They bought the dip on Baba. "
"24032500","24033960"," What does that mean for Baba?"
"24034920","24037340"," Typically, it means the banks are in here, right?"
"24037680","24038560"," You had capitulation."
"24040480","24041880"," And the banks bought this."
"24042280","24042780"," You didn't buy..."
"24042780","24046160"," You might have bought this, but generally speaking, the banks bought this right here. "
"24047120","24052960"," White House Press Secretary Sarkis is the US and China economic relationship is to be part of the"
"24052960","24053140"," call."
"24053660","24055280"," So they're going to get out whenever they feel like it."
"24057560","24060760"," And you saw some sellers and you're like, why are there sellers?"
"24061100","24062680"," It's because they were trapped above here. "
"24063680","24064660"," They just want out."
"24064800","24065480"," They're just like, fuck it."
"24065540","24065980"," I've been..."
"24065980","24067560"," I've been back all over so long. "
"24067720","24069100"," I don't trust any of this bullshit here."
"24069480","24071880"," And then the other thing you hear is you hear them saying that..."
"24071880","24073820"," We just heard a bunch of negative China news."
"24074300","24075900"," What are you truthful and honest with you guys?"
"24078530","24079770"," I don't think..."
"24079770","24082610"," I think China likes Russia where it's at. "
"24085610","24088830"," And the US also wants cheap goods from China."
"24090410","24093870"," And they'll use anything for an fucking excuse to get it as cheap as they possibly can."
"24094710","24095750"," Especially American banks. "
"24096410","24097810"," So this doesn't surprise me here."
"24097870","24098730"," This capitulation move."
"24099310","24101230"," And it also doesn't surprise that they bought it. "
"24101390","24104990"," And it also doesn't surprise me that behind the scenes the US needs cheap goods from China."
"24105730","24107970"," And China wants to give those cheap goods, believe it or not."
"24108410","24112030"," They're going to look like they're partnered with Russia, but they probably aren't. "
"24112410","24113970"," And the US needs China as a partner."
"24114250","24115850"," So you got a rejection here."
"24118090","24122890"," So what you're all you're looking for is if you're trading this, what you're looking for is this. "
"24125730","24127170"," Now you're looking for..."
"24127170","24128510"," You're going to short this."
"24128970","24129870"," You're going to buy this."
"24130450","24131470"," You're going to short this. "
"24131910","24134070"," And you're going to buy this right until it moves higher."
"24135610","24138290"," Don't fucking diddle in the middle on Baba here."
"24138730","24143550"," So the point that I would make you would be set some alerts down below. "
"24143850","24145910"," You're looking for a capitulation move at some point."
"24146590","24149430"," Doesn't matter if it takes a week, two weeks, or whatever."
"24149850","24150950"," Any kind of capitulation move. "
"24151090","24152470"," I think it's going higher, believe it or not."
"24152470","24154370"," I might not be shorting this stuff here."
"24154490","24155250"," Maybe for a change rate. "
"24155390","24156530"," It's being sponsored by Tickshrike."

"24164870","24166790"," I'm not making any money off this guy talking by the way. "
"24167270","24170370"," I'm going to dump this fucking thing at the end of today and glue on to something else."
"24171130","24172370"," So the key though is this."
"24173010","24173990"," You made it here. "
"24175170","24177230"," I guess you could trade this again."
"24177230","24183990"," You can see on the Baba chart that there's still some sellers here, right?"
"24184690","24186630"," You can see that they're above here."
"24187490","24188390"," Sellers at 105. "
"24189270","24194190"," The news agency that an Iraqi official says that four rockets fell in open areas around Iraq."
"24194430","24197170"," Ballad air base leaving no damage."
"24197750","24198570"," And then 110. "
"24198910","24200670"," You've got more resistance above here."
"24200730","24201270"," That makes sense."
"24201950","24207110"," The reason why I'm saying that is because what you're looking for is you want this. "
"24207650","24209190"," Consolidation for the next leg up."
"24209930","24211670"," You want that power behind the move."
"24211890","24216190"," You don't necessarily need to be falling on swords for that. "
"24216710","24219230"," It's not like you're going to miss it either."
"24221130","24223070"," Unless you're in spreads, if you're in spreads, you're probably fine."
"24225830","24227130"," You can see it right here, right?"
"24228870","24230510"," So you've got resistance here. "
"24230790","24231110"," Bang, bang, bang."
"24231590","24232850"," Maybe there's that one more move."
"24233070","24235250"," We already had that move though down here, which is kind of nice to see. "
"24235250","24238530"," Yeah, you can take a spread here for a trade higher."
"24238710","24239970"," You might not need to wait for this."
"24240190","24244250"," Too many oil and gas burns are increasing stock buybacks instead of increasing output. "
"24245150","24246410"," But what I would do is this."
"24247930","24249130"," Set alert right here."
"24249310","24251910"," Every time it comes back down here to this line right here. "
"24252570","24253730"," My little hand is."
"24254410","24255930"," Anytime it comes back down here, you just accumulate."
"24257250","24259330"," Whether it's now, whether it's a week, whether it's a month. "
"24260210","24262310"," And you just keep buying every time it comes back down again."
"24262310","24263610"," And hold."
"24264210","24265170"," I think Baba's going up. "
"24265750","24267570"," You guys want a price target in Baba?"
"24267970","24268790"," Pretty fucking big."
"24270490","24271570"," It's fucking giant."
"24273650","24275630"," I mean, you got this one right here. "
"24276070","24279070"," You could just do, you know, a measured move here."
"24279630","24281490"," I can't do it on this charting software."
"24281850","24285850"," The events of the IMF, World Bank, EBRD, and other institutions. "
"24286590","24290950"," They say that global economy will feel the effects of the Ukraine war through slower growth, trade"
"24290950","24292730"," disruptions, and higher prices."
"24293390","24297730"," Next price target in Baba, 126.67. Maybe slightly lower."
"24299530","24301270"," And then slightly higher from here, 143. "
"24302790","24304230"," I like Baba."
"24307410","24309490"," It's falling a little bit right now, but it doesn't matter."
"24311470","24312530"," It doesn't mean shit. "
"24315610","24316450"," Set an alert."
"24317170","24318010"," Keep setting alerts."
"24318010","24322510"," Every time I do one of these charts for you guys, create your own chart on your own, right?"
"24322850","24323950"," Set alerts on all these charts. "
"24324250","24327050"," Every time I do one of these, the next few weeks, I'm going to do these every single day."
"24327870","24331430"," And you guys are going to make your own charts, set alerts, even if it doesn't hit."
"24332190","24334950"," You're just going to keep it in the background because you've got a text message saying one day. "
"24335250","24335470"," Oh, yeah."
"24336110","24339370"," Can't tell me to set alert at 91.79 and all of a sudden we hit it."
"24340250","24343050"," So you're going to look to see at that point if it's market-generated news. "
"24343390","24344790"," Is it news in the headline news?"
"24345250","24349230"," Is it just the market being weak that day that you can get into your favorite ticker?"
"24349410","24355590"," Does it mean that they're actually that have some bad, you know, if it's just resuming."
"24356910","24357830"," It's trade down."
"24358190","24361830"," But set these on every ticker that we do. "
"24362890","24365690"," Hey, Carl, thanks for bringing up the SPYX dividend tomorrow, bro."
"24372790","24373230"," Yeah."
"24373490","24376830"," So what I had was, so what I did was this. "
"24376830","24380450"," What I, what I did was I signed up for, or I have trade the news."
"24380990","24383650"," Matter of fact, I still have fucking trade the news, believe it or not."
"24384410","24385490"," I still have it. "
"24387230","24391370"," But I canceled it and I got a pissing contest with him and canceled it."
"24391510","24396450"," And then I bought some other fucking news service and they didn't turn on this morning."
"24397770","24399890"," And so then I went and fucking broke. "
"24399890","24404650"," I broke down and bought, um, or, and Zinga this morning."
"24404650","24407730"," And then I canceled it because I fucking hate being Zinga too."
"24410030","24413610"," And I think this is a finance, someone recommended financial juice. "
"24413990","24415470"," So I think this is financial juice."
"24416390","24418490"," So I paid for them this morning and I'm not happy with it at all."
"24419110","24420450"," So someone recommended it on Twitter. "
"24421010","24424250"," So I'm going to fucking cancel this one end of the day and move on to the next one."
"24427840","24429600"," Let's look at Spy again real quick."
"24436000","24443000"," See if we can get this move up higher on Spy into the close. "
"24445320","24447780"," We bring up this Spy here."
"24451320","24457990"," Probably leave it a little bit closer to there."
"24457990","24461230"," And then see if we can actually trade this up. "
"24462230","24464530"," It's a nice little consolidation here."
"24464690","24472410"," I don't like, I can tell just from the premiums that the calls are losing value."
"24473230","24479650"," They're taking profit that bulls are taking profit here on their trade, which they should. "
"24480810","24485410"," And the last move that bulls are waiting for is if we do the creepy crawler to the top or"
"24485410","24487130"," if we sell off into the bell here."
"24492780","24497140"," Looks like bulls are extending their call buying into the 18th and 25th."
"24497520","24502580"," It's good to see more call buying on the Spy into close lots of bulls betting on this trade higher"
"24502580","24504140"," into the bell. "
"24514410","24516410"," So we'll see if they get their price target above."
"24516590","24522410"," We'll look higher here and see if they can push it up higher with that nice new tag coming above"
"24522410","24534760"," 4.47. And 4.50. Yeah, we're"
"24534760","24535880"," getting rid of this one at the end of the day."
"24540050","24541530"," No, I think I had newswire. "
"24541910","24546350"," I think I had newswire a long time ago."
"24547250","24548910"," I mean, you know, maybe I'll try newswire."
"24549890","24551350"," I haven't had them in a while. "
"24553610","24555310"," So if you guys, what's your favorite?"
"24555550","24557110"," You guys tell me what you think your favorite."
"24559070","24561590"," I got to do something here."
"24563470","24568330"," Now to the early market on close imbalance, just sitting at one spot, 4 billion to the south side. "
"24572500","24573980"," Let me know if."
"24577340","24579140"," Well, I got to do something real quick, you guys."
"24582440","24583860"," I got to do a switch real quick. "
"24584020","24584520"," Give me a second."
"24590400","24591820"," Give me just a second here."
"24601240","24602480"," Just a second here. "
"24604040","24604540"," Properties."
"24606440","24610500"," I'm going to take the monitor output."
"24610900","24612060"," Check one to check one to. "
"24622310","24623810"," I think that'll work."
"24625230","24630110"," We're getting a feedback echo from the desktop audio source."
"24630370","24638530"," I don't know what you guys know about video production, but I'm getting a feedback loop echo inside"
"24638530","24639170"," my headphones. "
"24639170","24640690"," I'm trying to turn it off right now."
"24641390","24642130"," Excuse me a second."
"24644190","24650370"," I just I just put that source into the mixer and I didn't fuck with the monitor on it. "
"24653270","24654490"," So we go back again."
"24656050","24657130"," So much new stuff."
"24661350","24663310"," There goes that price target above right. "
"24663710","24665250"," See right there, 44 47."
"24668450","24673090"," More buyers and sellers, even though we've got a south side imbalance, not always true."
"24673750","24676770"," Hero indicator is very positive heading into this belt. "
"24680340","24682640"," Vix is settling up a little bit."
"24683180","24689920"," And also the 440s went down to $1.13 at one point, not up to $1.41. There was a"
"24689920","24691520"," nice little buy in there for a quick play."
"24695180","24698300"," Let me move you guys over here so I can read what you guys are saying. "
"24698860","24702760"," So confirm now is the US House votes to revoke normal trade status with Russia?"
"24704200","24705220"," I love trade the news."
"24708100","24709660"," Yeah, I like trade the news."
"24709940","24710680"," I got into a fight. "
"24710880","24712080"," I don't know who I got into a fight with."
"24712100","24713400"," It was someone in their back office."
"24715520","24724220"," I'm going to fight with someone in their back office and I got stinky about it. "
"24725280","24727120"," And I was like, yeah, fucking what fuck you then?"
"24727160","24727700"," I'm fucking quitting."
"24728700","24731400"," I became a big, big email flaming war."
"24732740","24735260"," Maybe I'll ask for a supervisor or something and talk to them. "
"24740860","24745280"," So yeah, just so you guys know, like I don't have any commercials on my streams."
"24745400","24746080"," I don't have any."
"24746360","24748560"," I don't sell ads on YouTube. "
"24748560","24749340"," I can't."
"24749420","24750140"," I just don't."
"24750740","24753840"," I don't do any of that kind of stuff. "
"24770040","24771360"," Just a second here."
"24779570","24785530"," White House press secretary, says that we have seen no evidence that Russia is deescalating a new"
"24785530","24785790"," crime."
"24786310","24788690"," So this is a repeated sentiment just from yesterday as well. "
"24801530","24805870"," Yeah, like I have used trade the news on and off over the years."
"24806790","24809570"," They they're not as good as they used to be."
"24810710","24814670"," So I've used trade the news for at least four years, I think. "
"24815250","24815970"," They're very pricey."
"24816250","24816630"," They're not cheap."
"24817090","24820250"," They are very expensive, but they also. "
"24821470","24824570"," You know, the other thing too is I could just read the fucking news to you."
"24825390","24828410"," As it as it pops up, or I can put you know what I can do."
"24829470","24830530"," So I can get. "
"24833050","24836970"," I can make a I can make a bot that would be an AI that would just read the news"
"24836970","24838890"," as it comes into trade the news."
"24842510","24843050"," It's good."
"24843110","24846110"," Take some work for me to to design one, but. "
"24847230","24848810"," There are options on the table."
"24850270","24853490"," I just need to give me like the night to when I get done with this, I'll."
"24853870","24858870"," I'll do some more work on the problem is that if I don't do it outside of trading hours, you"
"24858870","24859750"," don't really get the full picture. "
"24865500","24867760"," New squawks used to be better than they are right now."
"24867800","24868400"," Maybe that helps."
"24870840","24873820"," New squawks used to be used to be baller. "
"24874040","24875940"," They've come they've come out of favor with traders."
"24876780","24879540"," Traders are lying often on times on social media for their information."
"24880060","24883840"," Even even Walter Bloomberg doesn't get it before you get it on trade the news. "
"24884600","24886140"," So like that newswire subscription."
"24886440","24887300"," We are trading higher right now."
"24887360","24889480"," The spy spies looking to make that move. "
"24889980","24891780"," We'll see if it's just the trap bowls here."
"24891940","24892680"," I think that it is."
"24893540","24897240"," Trap bowls, but we could see if we can trade higher into the close. "
"24897820","24900020"," It is now three thirty five and a half an hour left."
"24910960","24911760"," I'm too busy."
"24912080","24913380"," Yeah, but we do have kids. "
"24913680","24914140"," They got a wife."
"24915300","24916400"," U.K. Questions."
"24916560","24919600"," I had a plan to potentially suspend the Northern Ireland EU deal. "
"24920220","24921520"," U.K.'s Foreign Minister."
"24921800","24925380"," Truffs gave Brexit orders due to the frustrations over the EU talks."
"24926260","24926680"," Yeah. "
"24926760","24927400"," That shit going on."
"24927520","24932900"," But then I'm trying to deal with this hardware side of the stream to get it up and running for"
"24932900","24933860"," you guys as it grows."
"24934240","24935780"," Like as the matting ship to the stream. "
"24936840","24939740"," It's a it's just a growing pains."
"24939860","24942380"," We've only been doing this for a couple months now I think right."
"24942380","24943940"," Like two, three months or something. "
"24944340","24945880"," It's just it's just growing pains."
"24946980","24948140"," And frustration too."
"24948380","24948720"," Trust me. "
"24949900","24951320"," And of course hardware."
"24952840","24953800"," It gets hardware."
"24954500","24954700"," I'm learning. "
"24955880","24959720"," I'm learning that when you upgrade your hardware on one side of something you have to upgrade"
"24959720","24960040"," everything."
"24960300","24962100"," It's not like you can just upgrade one fucking thing."
"24962680","24963680"," You have to upgrade everything. "
"24964260","24965260"," It's like oh you did this."
"24965400","24966060"," Now you got to do that."
"24966220","24966720"," You got to do this. "
"24966880","24967480"," Now you got to do that."
"24967740","24969520"," Oh, you're now you're doing this."
"24969580","24970160"," You got to do that. "
"24973680","24977680"," Oh, yeah, you guys want to you guys want to tell you what I think's going to happen tomorrow."
"24978800","24979800"," Yeah, I don't have hunches."
"24980220","24983100"," I can tell you every day you guys know I trade the clothes all the time. "
"24983620","24984440"," All the time."
"24984960","24987480"," Everyone here knows that I trade clothes is all the time."
"24989080","24991640"," I'll show you what my hunches are for today and tomorrow. "
"24991740","24991980"," Okay."
"24993040","24994420"," So here we go."
"24994440","24995800"," I'll meet this one right here. "
"24997540","24999940"," I'm going to come over to this chart right here."
"25000400","25001900"," I'm going to say exactly what I think is going to happen."
"25003160","25010380"," I'm going to show you guys exactly what I think is going to happen. "
"25015760","25017240"," So today, wait a minute."
"25017440","25018220"," Give me a second here."
"25021320","25023880"," So today we've got we've got some problems. "
"25024340","25029760"," Not problems, but what we got is we've got a ton of calls up here."
"25029920","25030020"," Okay."
"25033240","25040620"," And unless you see a stock call expansion today, higher, like 450, right, farther dated out, which"
"25040620","25041620"," we didn't see a ton of that. "
"25041740","25043080"," We saw some, but not a lot of it more."
"25043220","25043680"," It's in the money."
"25044520","25045160"," You're not going. "
"25045160","25046380"," I don't think you're going to see it trade higher."
"25047380","25048100"," It says 41."
"25048720","25049840"," We have opx tomorrow. "
"25050160","25050560"," Well, not opx."
"25050840","25050920"," Yeah."
"25052100","25053720"," We've got quad watching tomorrow into Monday. "
"25054740","25056220"," Now, my thought would be we'd trade."
"25057540","25062080"," Down in this area next next two days in here, between here and Monday."
"25062400","25063720"," But there, this is where they want it. "
"25064100","25067600"," Somewhere between 425, maybe 435 somewhere in here."
"25068980","25069640"," Into Monday."
"25069920","25070620"," How we get there. "
"25072300","25076940"," You could see us trade up the one, the one issue with the overnight is you could see."
"25077280","25080460"," If you're a futures trader, you'd have to, because you could see something like this."
"25081140","25084240"," You can even see somewhere you tag it up in there, but then we start to trade it down. "
"25084880","25086080"," You could see something like that."
"25086620","25088560"," And you kind of get fucked if you're holding calls in the close."
"25090180","25091940"," We could just see the rollover as well. "
"25095960","25096920"," Hold on here."
"25097700","25100160"," I could just see the rollover as well into this area."
"25100680","25104260"," Could see the squeeze higher to get that price that we're looking for. "
"25104940","25108380"," The problem with doing it in here in this overnight is if you're not hedged, it could end up"
"25108380","25109300"," rolling back down."
"25110700","25112640"," Where do they want this stuff to print for opx?"
"25112880","25113540"," Then what's going to happen?"
"25113540","25120580"," My thought process is that we roll here into Monday, and the next leg up is somewhere over here."
"25120820","25125440"," Before we trade sideways, we fuck around in here, take everybody's money, and then we make it move"
"25125440","25125700"," higher. "
"25126340","25133860"," So we could do some kind of nonsense like this at some point, and then it becomes just a shit"
"25133860","25136220"," show from here into Monday."
"25136220","25141480"," I could even trade as low in there, and then the next leg higher."
"25143020","25144980"," We'll just get rid of that. "
"25146340","25149300"," Now, I also think that we can dip lower."
"25149700","25152260"," We trade in an area, right?"
"25152480","25156700"," We expect this in here, but then we end up briefly going down low."
"25157280","25158640"," This is my trade into Friday and Monday. "
"25158640","25163300"," Again, now to the early market on close imbalance, because we're sitting at 1.4 billion to the"
"25163300","25163760"," south side."
"25164720","25168140"," This here, I do think this happens."
"25168400","25168520"," Sorry. "
"25169280","25171160"," I still think that this happens here."
"25171600","25174460"," We roll this market over into Friday, possibly even into Monday."
"25175100","25177440"," This is Friday and this will be Monday, and then you buy your calls here. "
"25177800","25187740"," It's also possible that it could settle down in there, and we take the trade higher, something"
"25187740","25188340"," like that."
"25188340","25196080"," And if Vol kicks off, it would take a longer period of time to make this next move to 450."
"25196080","25199900"," It could take some time for us to get there if Vol gets crushed. "
"25200340","25207800"," Now, with that being said, we've got puts rolling off on Friday into Monday, which should crush Vol"
"25208320","25212320"," unless they re-up puts for a lower leg down the road there."
"25212920","25216500"," I just see a waterfall cascade of actual hedging coming into the market here."
"25216500","25218880"," You can see this after the 4 or 4 or 15 hour. "
"25219200","25221140"," So for today, what would be the recommendation for today?"
"25223560","25226220"," You're going to be looking, of course, for..."
"25228080","25229920"," Of course, looking for this move higher."
"25230480","25232160"," It could happen now into the bell."
"25234020","25237760"," We squeeze higher here, or it could happen from now into the 4 or 15. "
"25238580","25239360"," We squeeze higher."
"25239920","25241020"," It's already happening right now."
"25242200","25245600"," But we could see that squeeze try to tag that upper range. "
"25246740","25248140"," Squeeze the last of the shorts out."
"25248400","25250320"," I doubt that we trade higher than this tomorrow."
"25250840","25255640"," So either sideways and sideways and down into tomorrow, Monday is my call for..."
"25255640","25258400"," If you're hearing calls, I think you take profit before the bell today. "
"25258900","25259460"," One way or another."
"25260120","25260880"," You take profit today."
"25261360","25263520"," I would not hold calls into tomorrow. "
"25265360","25266160"," I hope that helps."
"25267980","25270620"," I would be trading flat today if I was a bull."
"25271080","25274100"," And if I was a bear, I would be putting some shit on into this bell. "
"25274100","25275020"," Without a doubt."
"25285960","25287220"," There goes the creepy crawly."
"25287440","25288400"," Moving up to 440-13. "
"25289400","25291860"," You'll see the last of the shorts come off between here."
"25292240","25295200"," And the upper bound is 443-31."
"25296560","25299720"," Hopefully the bulls can get up there and make quick trade, make some fast cash. "
"25300700","25304600"," We did see 440s trade all the way down to $1 and change, like $13."
"25305620","25308440"," Now to $1.84 on 440Cs."
"25308800","25309440"," They are in the money. "
"25309440","25313500"," And let's look at calls for tomorrow."
"25314120","25317060"," I'm not seeing any big call structure around 450s."
"25317360","25319580"," So 450s are at 7 cents for tomorrow. "
"25320320","25323500"," There's no option interest there."
"25324040","25326820"," Let's look at Mondays on the 21st."
"25328120","25332740"," And so for Monday for 450, I see 29 cents. "
"25333260","25336520"," I don't see any options interest on Monday for 450s."
"25337180","25338840"," Let's look for the 23rd."
"25338840","25341940"," And 450s have 68 cents. "
"25342540","25343560"," Not that big either."
"25344120","25347000"," And for the 25th."
"25347100","25349320"," Seeing some, nope, no calls there either. "
"25349980","25352300"," They're $1.21. Or 450."
"25352660","25353620"," No one's seeing that either."
"25355940","25356520"," 28th of March. "
"25358820","25361560"," The stream is sponsored by Ticksright."
"25361960","25365800"," Ticksright allows you to actually hear water flowing futures for example."
"25365800","25369700"," This shit is driving me to free trial at Ticksright.com."
"25370140","25371280"," Turn that shit down. "
"25376060","25377060"," March 30th."
"25377060","25383500"," The market makers aren't pricing in a move to 450."
"25384080","25385920"," We might move there, but they're not pricing it in. "
"25391060","25392280"," So we'll come back here."
"25392280","25394540"," There's that 440 tick talked about this morning."
"25408260","25410560"," We had 440, 23 or something. "
"25410620","25412920"," It's ticked at 440 or 440, 30."
"25428690","25429490"," Good to see you."
"25429510","25429690"," Hi, Trent. "
"25431370","25435550"," A little piece of zero learning off on YouTube about components, AMD, CPU, and GPU."
"25435890","25438670"," Yeah, that's I've got AMD and I've got a red devil."
"25438670","25443070"," My CPU is AMD. "
"25444190","25446650"," And then I've got a red devil GPU."
"25448270","25449230"," This is badass."
"25457800","25459560"," That's early mark on close imbalance. "
"25459760","25463460"," I'm changing the prior reads at one spot, 4 billion to south side."
"25466860","25471860"," Nice pen strike, 440.33. Let's see it right up here."
"25476040","25476680"," Bam. "
"25478440","25479080"," Blando."
"25484120","25484760"," Gorgeous."
"25488120","25493240"," And we'll switch back over to, let's see if we can get this. "
"25496160","25498440"," Just chilling like a villain over here."
"25500080","25502700"," Equal on buyers and sellers at this point."
"25503980","25506800"," And the heroin decay is cooling off slightly. "
"25511000","25513260"," Still seeing the VIX kind of just chilling out."
"25513400","25514020"," We're doing its thing."
"25514960","25521780"," We know we've got a lot of, we've got a lot of puts rolling off as we head into tomorrow. "
"25522420","25532320"," There is one positive that a lot of institutions were expected to"
"25532320","25537780"," hold their puts into the close of Friday and let them expire."
"25538600","25543160"," And this looks like a lot of them are actually closing their puts that is very bullish on the"
"25543160","25544040"," market in general."
"25544380","25548500"," Even if we trade back, it is very bullish watching the squeeze higher. "
"25548840","25552800"," Now at 440, 45 on the on spy."
"25553500","25555960"," We've got 14 minutes left into the bell."
"25557140","25562120"," Still hearing about a sell side imbalance, but that's not showing itself on real buyers and sellers"
"25562120","25562500"," here. "
"25563060","25570820"," We were about even slightly higher on buyers currently now trading at 440.47. You guys think we can"
"25570820","25572480"," trade this up into the bell?"
"25572740","25573660"," I don't know, I'm not sure."
"25574780","25585720"," This is very bullish on the market when you trade higher at this 440.47. 440"
"25585720","25594210"," is now trading up to $1.90. 440 sees $1.93. Beautiful lady."
"25594750","25622810"," Now 440.50. Hold"
"25622810","25624630"," on, I'm going to close out a trade here. "
"25654890","25664820"," I think"
"25664820","25666040"," it's hard to trade."
"25666360","25670980"," I think it's going to be hard to trade the overnight unless you're trading."
"25672480","25679140"," I think it's hard to trade the cash market here into the bell unless you can hedge the overnight. "
"25703200","25704900"," 11 minutes left into the bell."
"25707880","25717000"," Rounding off at 440.58. See if they can do the creepy crawly into the close here price target."
"25717000","25729900"," If it does the creepy crawly up the last few minutes or so would be 443.34. Let me"
"25729900","25730220"," see. "
"25746620","25748740"," There has spied bottomed from a long term investor."
"25749680","25750900"," In some ways it has Jason."
"25753480","25755260"," You have to be selective in what you're buying. "
"25759800","25762620"," This way it's going to be final orders now ahead of the market."
"25762820","25767680"," It's sell side by saving relevantly someone buying calls."
"25768120","25772200"," There's different hedges. "
"25772960","25773880"," Sometimes it's calls."
"25776000","25777000"," Sometimes it's stock."
"25777240","25778280"," Sometimes it's not stock. "
"25778640","25780280"," It's a long conversation, Josh."
"25780800","25782640"," We should have the summer when it's slow."
"25783560","25785060"," But yes and no. "
"25785220","25788200"," It is settling at $3 billion to the sell side."
"25788520","25789820"," That's the market on both imbalance."
"25790120","25791480"," That's $3 billion to sell. "
"25795540","25802560"," The hedging of let's say I buy calls and they hedge against those calls."
"25803440","25806300"," There are multiple ways they can hedge against those calls."
"25825060","25827400"," You need to get new pair headphones. "
"25837700","25842720"," Yeah, you want to see above $4.40. The clothes you want to see above $4.40. He doesn't have"
"25842720","25843180"," to be there."
"25843740","25845400"," You guys don't have to be there."
"25845520","25849300"," The only thing you have to be at, what you really want to be at is if you're a bull,"
"25851880","25855880"," is you want to be above this right here. "
"25856280","25864700"," You want to be above $4.36. It is better to be above $4.40. The above $4.40 doesn't"
"25864700","25865460"," matter if you trade back."
"25880920","25882000"," But you do want to see it."
"25882060","25884620"," If you're a bull, you're like, hey, I want to see above $4.40. It's a big move. "
"25885040","25888840"," Like $4.40 has been brutal for bulls for a long time."
"25889000","25892740"," It's been a point of contention for some time."
"25893700","25896420"," So anything of a close down in here is going to be good for bulls. "
"25896720","25897540"," Either way, this is bullish."
"25898320","25903700"," It's better above $4.40, of course, because if anything you trade back or give back in here, I will"
"25903700","25911220"," probably still lead to this next leg up to $4.50. You don't want to see a close below this"
"25911220","25913640"," $4.35, $4.36 area at all."
"25915740","25919420"," And you don't want to see a bear's takeover as well and put us back into volatility. "
"25920280","25930280"," That would send us back down below that $4.36. You get the"
"25930280","25938750"," VIX still trading off, which raises a new question for you out there."
"25939470","25947250"," We had this big conversation, right, that I don't expect VIX to be below $4.30, right?"
"25947570","25949330"," Everybody's been talking about that for weeks and months."
"25949990","25952770"," $30, $30, $30, $30, $30. "
"25952770","25954810"," And now you see the VIX trading below it, $25."
"25955950","25964310"," So does the question become, if in 2020, 2021, you could pretty much guarantee that the VIX hit"
"25964310","25966450"," $12, $13, $15."
"25967250","25969170"," You take the opposite side of the trade, right?"
"25969450","25971970"," And it looks like we're going from $30 down to $20. "
"25973550","25975350"," So that becomes the next question, right?"
"25975630","25982790"," Does the VIX now get the baseline of VIX get lowered down to $20 to take a short rather than"
"25982790","25983170"," $30?"
"25984390","25987690"," Big question mark on that question here in the market, right?"
"25987870","25992510"," So when you guys are looking to take short or long after this FOMC, at least for the time being,"
"25992830","25997170"," has the bottom lowered from $30 down to $20?"
"26001620","26004400"," We'll switch back over here to the..."
"26010960","26014560"," VWAP is now higher at $4.37.30 or so."
"26016020","26044620"," $4.37.30. Give"
"26044620","26046340"," me that creepy crawly in the clothes, baby."
"26048180","26049460"," Squeeze it right to the top. "
"26050620","26051220"," Dump that shit."
"26051500","26052600"," Ayers, dump it."
"26054800","26055780"," Give up the goods. "
"26059100","26061420"," We've got five minutes into the bell."
"26061880","26065740"," Bulls are wondering if the bears are going to give it up this last few minutes into the bell or"
"26065740","26066020"," not."
"26068600","26074940"," You get that little burst right into the last few minutes where you just go straight north, crawl,"
"26075240","26077200"," climb the wall into the bell. "
"26077980","26079380"," We'll see if we get it these last few minutes."
"26079600","26083260"," It's not too rare of an occurrence, but when it happens, it's pretty fucking cool."
"26083260","26085300"," You get the creepy crawly, it goes red for a while. "
"26085620","26086340"," Zip, zip, zip, zip."
"26086520","26090780"," All those last shorts the last minute are closed out, heading into Friday."
"26091480","26095520"," We'll see if that takes place these last five minutes into the bell. "
"26095700","26098320"," Maybe we can slam it home in cash market."
"26099900","26101900"," Bulls want to see it one way or another."
"26102300","26106100"," That is the hope if you are a bull that you want to see us just slam it up. "
"26106840","26108680"," Squeeze every last short out of the market."
"26111500","26113980"," We'll see if we can make that happen the last two or three minutes here."
"26113980","26115780"," It doesn't always happen when it does. "
"26115920","26116680"," It's kind of neat to watch."
"26135780","26143380"," Richard, we'll have to talk about Josh."
"26143680","26144680"," Give me a second, bro. "
"26144780","26147040"," As soon as the market bell rings, I'll talk about it."
"26149080","26151020"," The stock being sold, but it's bullish."
"26158020","26158420"," No. "
"26158940","26159500"," All right."
"26160140","26161900"," So yes and no."
"26162300","26162520"," All right. "
"26167220","26168840"," No, let me try to explain it in simpler."
"26181160","26182000"," Is the feed pause?"
"26182540","26183260"," Feed should be good."
"26186120","26186860"," Feed should be good. "
"26187000","26188880"," You guys, oh, you got, oh, this feed here."
"26189620","26190260"," Oh, I pressed pay."
"26190700","26191120"," Oh, my bad. "
"26191940","26192360"," My bad."
"26194800","26195860"," I apologize for that."
"26197180","26198780"," Give me that blast up to the top. "
"26199000","26199360"," Give it to me."
"26200740","26203160"," We got three minutes left into the bell."
"26203900","26205320"," Please like and subscribe these videos. "
"26206080","26210100"," I'm trying to build this thing so it gets back up and running here day in, day out."
"26210220","26211140"," I will be back again tomorrow."
"26211200","26214280"," Seems like I've got this thing kind of stuff to where it needs to be. "
"26214720","26217980"," What I need to be able to do is just come into the office, sit down and trade with you"
"26217980","26218520"," guys every day."
"26219520","26223280"," It's hard trying to get all the stuff set up and then I'm not here."
"26224080","26225460"," Or I'm not able to trade as well. "
"26225720","26227520"," So I have, I'm not an active day trader myself."
"26229120","26232760"," And so just adding all the stuff up takes time and energy, of course."
"26233020","26235980"," And then, of course, I'm here with you guys from open to close. "
"26236280","26241980"," I don't think I know anybody that trades live all day long out there on a live stream."
"26246550","26248150"," So they're going to pin it into the bell here, huh?"
"26248770","26249070"," Nothing."
"26250150","26250930"," Damn, that sucks. "
"26251550","26255830"," I wanted to see that last little ripper right into the brand, into the face melter straight up to"
"26255830","26256230"," like 443."
"26257710","26260030"," So I guess it would be that we could get that in the overnight."
"26260030","26265450"," You could get that, that ripped up 443, 444 and then a slow roll over into tomorrow. "
"26266050","26268450"," Let me know in the chat what you guys think will happen in the overnight."
"26269510","26270390"," I think you get that."
"26270570","26272670"," I think you get a slow roll over into tomorrow. "
"26273130","26276590"," We could, we could be green after the bell to like, let's say 443, 444."
"26277770","26280070"," And then it starts to roll over once the open comes tomorrow."
"26280070","26281950"," Start to settle down the market into Friday. "
"26287350","26288250"," No, it doesn't."
"26288750","26290150"," There's, there is no correlation."
"26290510","26293010"," There is no correlation with oil in the market. "
"26293410","26298950"," There can be correlation at times, but in the, if you look at oil over time, there is no"
"26298950","26299250"," correlation."
"26301470","26303270"," It's hard to, it's cut."
"26303670","26310370"," Of course, the bottom buying of oil ripped money out of equities into oil, but it's hard to"
"26310370","26312770"," correlate oil to our markets. "
"26313810","26315050"," Oh, here's the creepy crawly."
"26315830","26317470"," Give me that creepy crawly to the bell, baby."
"26319070","26320070"," You got one minute left. "
"26321610","26322710"," Give me that creepy crawly."
"26322770","26323370"," Give me that last minute."
"26323630","26324610"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"26325370","26326470"," Give me that last minute."
"26326730","26328190"," Pull shit, baby, up to the top."
"26328770","26330190"," Give me that creepy crawly after the bell. "
"26330990","26331550"," Give it to me."
"26332650","26332990"," Give it to me."
"26333210","26335150"," 40, 440, 441. "
"26335870","26337710"," Give me that creepy crawly on that bell."
"26338050","26338370"," Give it to me."
"26338610","26340550"," 440, 60, 7, 440, 71. "
"26341510","26342430"," Almost there, baby."
"26342710","26343450"," Give it to the end of the bell."
"26344010","26345410"," Squeeze every last short out. "
"26345410","26346230"," 440, 72."
"26347590","26348650"," There we go."
"26348930","26350270"," Push it, baby, into that bell. "
"26350710","26351970"," 440, 104."
"26352830","26353910"," Whoo-hoo!"
"26359000","26360080"," Whoo-hoo-hoo!"
"26366770","26368110"," Maybe I saw you guys too."
"26371560","26371860"," Yeah. "
"26372180","26373520"," How to, yes, do it correct."
"26373780","26379320"," There is a rate of change that does affect the markets, but the correlation over time doesn't"
"26379320","26380160"," really matter as much."
"26381700","26391260"," You will see, you will see hard cash or leave equities for commodities or for bonds, or just be"
"26391260","26391740"," straight cash. "
"26392160","26392700"," You will see that."
"26392760","26393280"," I agree with that."
"26393980","26399460"," But it's hard to correlate commodities with equity markets over time. "
"26400240","26401160"," My only point."
"26404900","26405900"," Look at that."
"26406080","26406420"," Right under the bell. "
"26406660","26407560"," 441, 15."
"26409300","26410140"," Bam-o."
"26410700","26413500"," 440 is just screamed into that bell too. "
"26413940","26414780"," 440 C's."
"26418310","26418970"," All right."
"26419210","26424890"," So let's talk about, let's talk about a few things on. "
"26425310","26428770"," Before we get off here, we're going to try to simplify this."
"26430930","26434790"," It's hard to simplify too, because it gets more complex."
"26434990","26435810"," It gets very complex. "
"26437470","26439430"," But yes, they can short."
"26439910","26441190"," They can sell calls."
"26442950","26444950"," They can sell calls to hedge. "
"26445370","26447950"," They can short the underlying."
"26448970","26450990"," They can just sell equities too."
"26451410","26453510"," They can buy equities to buy them back. "
"26454950","26456310"," To hedge the bet."
"26457090","26460970"," So the, at the end of the day, right, all being equal, right?"
"26461330","26465410"," You have to be able to hedge against the bet that's made."
"26465410","26468170"," In case that bet prints, right?"
"26468390","26469310"," So you have to. "
"26470510","26473050"," Now, so let's say, I don't know."
"26473110","26475110"," I'm getting tired right now to explain this, but."
"26476890","26478210"," To simplify it. "
"26483050","26484470"," I can't do it right now."
"26484650","26485230"," I'm tired."
"26485510","26486030"," I'm going to be honest. "
"26486650","26490170"," But I have a way of simplifying this that I usually explain it."
"26490770","26491710"," But they have to."
"26491950","26495450"," Basically, you're, you've got, you're making a gamble, right?"
"26495750","26500230"," The stock A is going to go from $1 to $10. "
"26501890","26509590"," And so if that stock is $1 and it goes to $10, I have to pay you $9 on that"
"26509590","26510310"," trade, right?"
"26513010","26516930"," So I have to cover that trade and have to make some, well, there's like fees involved."
"26516930","26519090"," But then it has to be able to pay you that $10."
"26519490","26523110"," Take that trade with someone else on the opposite side of that trade. "
"26523490","26526710"," That's betting that the stock, I guess the dollar is not a good way to look at it."
"26527010","26528770"," Like $10 stocks $10."
"26529170","26530150"," You're like, that's my bet. "
"26530270","26530930"," It's going to go to 20."
"26532750","26536170"," And there's someone on the opposite or hopefully there's someone on the opposite side of that"
"26536170","26536410"," trade."
"26536950","26540450"," That's saying, Nope, I think it's going to a dollar, right?"
"26541770","26545470"," So you have to hedge the opposite side of that trade one way or. "
"26548650","26549570"," Don't bother now."
"26549730","26551170"," Yeah, I'm too tired of that for this."
"26551430","26553890"," My brain is fucking fried at this point. "
"26555150","26556130"," I'll explain it better."
"26556290","26556710"," You know what I'll do?"
"26557750","26561570"," Is I'll explain it better tomorrow morning when I'm wide awake."
"26562070","26563770"," I've explained it here in the channel in the past. "
"26564970","26566610"," They do take the opposite side of the trade."
"26566770","26569710"," But then there's another trade on the opposite side of that trade as well."
"26570070","26571610"," It's not just them hedging. "
"26571610","26576210"," It's other people that are betting against that trade that factor into it."
"26577130","26580130"," And then making the money on the opposite side of that trade."
"26580830","26585190"," So let's say, so we're going up now to 440, right?"
"26585730","26591850"," You don't have to hedge this trade anymore as the risk of us going down there comes off. "
"26592090","26593230"," So they start to de hedge."
"26593850","26599590"," The market makers start to de hedge us going to 405, let's say, by March 18th."
"26599590","26601990"," They do it actively in cash market. "
"26602330","26605850"," Sometimes they don't until after until futures as well."
"26606250","26607570"," But there's other problems in this."
"26608110","26616430"," An example would be that these hedges could be moved over to futures market and not cash market. "
"26616850","26621110"," So you might not see where that money went to for stuff that was in the money."
"26621590","26623030"," We'll talk about this more in depth tomorrow."
"26624550","26627650"," I should write all this out on to like a spreadsheet or something. "
"26627870","26630770"," I'm not spreadsheet, but a line by line."
"26632950","26634370"," Explanation because it is important."
"26639300","26641720"," Puts for Friday question mark. "
"26642740","26648260"," It's tough if you're if you I would I would say if I was a futures trader, I would be"
"26648260","26652620"," looking for us to trade to 443, 444 in the overnight and then short the fuck out of it."
"26653500","26654480"," That's what I would say."
"26659010","26660990"," Put spread would work wonders here too. "
"26664580","26665620"," But I am short."
"26665740","26668860"," If you want to know I am holding puts into Friday."
"26674940","26676420"," You guys all have a wonderful evening. "
"26677140","26678240"," Thank you for showing up today."
"26678300","26680480"," I'll be back again tomorrow with another live stream for you."
"26680800","26684940"," I seem to have worked out most of the kinks on this end. "
"26685160","26687220"," If you are new here or just rejoining us."
"26687320","26692120"," I do want you to know that we are now running another live stream within the discord for."
"26692720","26694820"," Each day for the options flow. "
"26695220","26697880"," We have another news service, but I'm not happy with it."
"26698300","26699540"," So we'll see that again tomorrow."
"26699620","26702620"," I got to switch around some physical stuff for tomorrow and I also have to. "
"26703100","26705160"," Add in a way to put links."
"26705660","26711440"," Every day into the chat for invites to the discord for any of you out there that are."
"26714760","26719060"," Mediate or moderators or helping out within the stream and. "
"26719060","26724140"," The discord I appreciate your patience with me and supporting the stream and staying with us inside"
"26724140","26724640"," the stream."
"26725500","26730960"," I've had a lot of work to do outside of this stream and then of course on the stream itself."
"26731140","26736260"," I've got a ton of work mechanical work and of course frustration is mixed in there and trying to"
"26736260","26736500"," trade. "
"26737040","26739560"," So I appreciate your patience right now as you as you move forward."
"26740280","26742560"," And I will see you guys again tomorrow morning."
"26742740","26744700"," I will address the hedging. "
"26745480","26748640"," That's weird because I used to have a really good way to describe it."
"26748720","26752560"," A simple way to describe it so people can understand it basic base to be able to basically"
"26752560","26753880"," understand the basics of it."
"26754040","26755400"," The basic mechanics of it. "
"26755880","26758980"," But we do have some other problems with that currently in this market."
"26761040","26766560"," Where hedging can be placed elsewhere and you don't see it in cash market."
"26767240","26771440"," So we'll expand upon this this concept tomorrow and I'll try to. "
"26772760","26776960"," Simplify it so that as you are trading the market you can see the impacts."
"26777380","26778660"," There's another part to this too."
"26779220","26782200"," Some of the people always argue like oh that what about buyers and sellers. "
"26782980","26786000"," That I want to talk about as well and I can't put it into words right now."
"26786420","26789420"," But there's someone always on the opposite side of the trade right."
"26789900","26792540"," So you're like well what happens to the other side of that trade. "
"26794580","26797900"," Here and that's where you need to see like when I always talk about waterfall."
"26798580","26801620"," Puts or calls or the difference between puts and hedging."
"26802100","26805600"," And the amplification impacts upon where if we go there or not. "
"26806080","26808800"," And then of course if it wears off."
"26809320","26812480"," Expansion of calls what is a call wall what is a put wall."
"26813000","26815440"," What is absolute gamma on the put and call side. "
"26815900","26819940"," So I need to write it all out so that I can maybe visualize it for you while I talk"
"26819940","26820520"," to you about it."
"26820820","26825480"," Well well draw it on a piece of paper for you and explain how you actually get to the price"
"26825480","26826140"," you want to be at."
"26826140","26828980"," Why there's a call wall why there's a put wall. "
"26829580","26833800"," And what you need to actually get there it actually can be simplified down to a bag."
"26834200","26837820"," Literally just like I you hear people say there's a bag in this little bit more room in it."
"26838580","26841380"," And when you do have that bag of little bit more room in it. "
"26841460","26846380"," You still need bag holders above that point to continue to buy those puts and those calls."
"26847500","26848640"," As we move forward."
"26849060","26849520"," So. "
"26850200","26852220"," And there's sometimes this value in there."
"26853180","26855880"," There's some arbitrage value in there as well that you'll find."
"26856100","26859920"," But this this conversation is complex and it can be simplified. "
"26860040","26862380"," I used to be able to simplify it quite easily."
"26862460","26863980"," I think I'm just tired at this point."
"26864200","26865820"," I've been up since like three or four o'clock. "
"26865980","26870340"," Matter of fact I was up at three a.m. and trying to work out the last kinks and getting"
"26870340","26876060"," this fucking stream up and running for you guys out there because it's been complicated as we have"
"26876060","26880680"," done these upgrades to bring you a smooth, seamless stream."
"26881280","26883040"," So I will see you all tomorrow morning."
"26883480","26888160"," I should be on no later than nine a.m. But I hope to be on at least by eight"
"26888160","26888420"," thirty. "
"26889020","26890000"," So we can do our same."
"26891200","26893440"," Our city because they basically have two shows right."
"26893860","26898840"," We've got the pre market show and that sets you up for the day so you know where we're going"
"26898840","26901180"," what to anticipate if we move up or down. "
"26901840","26906320"," And then we also live stream the day day trading throughout the day."
"26906740","26908200"," So all you guys have a wonderful afternoon."
"26911860","26914460"," And I'll see all you guys tomorrow morning. "
"26915500","26918460"," And make sure you're tuning in in the morning even if you just check in throughout the day."
"26918860","26923840"," Try to be here in the morning so that you can have a perspective from what we're so what we're"
"26923840","26925220"," talking about throughout the day."
"26925800","26929860"," Often times you get lots of questions and if you've just been here for that first half an hour an"
"26929860","26930220"," hour or so. "
"26930780","26934800"," You've at least got a perspective of where we're coming from as we trade the market because we give"
"26934800","26937780"," both the bull bear and."
"26937780","26944080"," And theta sideways trade each day and so that when you pop in and out of the live stream."
"26944440","26950140"," You have a reference point as to where we're at and why we're there and what we what our"
"26950140","26951800"," expectations are at that point forward. "
"26952580","26954060"," You guys all have a wonderful afternoon."
"26954340","26956060"," I appreciate all of you being here."
"26956300","26960100"," I want you to know that it blows in mind that you show up every day. "
"26960740","26961060"," Okay."
"26961380","26963200"," So I'll check in with you guys again tomorrow morning."
"26963520","26965100"," I look forward to seeing you out there on Twitter. "
