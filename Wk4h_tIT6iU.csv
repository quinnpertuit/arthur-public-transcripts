"201950","208390"," that this morning, and what should be happening this week, we'll talk about that, then of course"
"208390","213790"," I'm shitposting all week long on Twitter about it, because I'm laughing my ass off the entire time,"
"213790","217350"," and then I told you guys it wouldn't be here until Wednesday, that was just more shitposting on"
"217350","222210"," Twitter, anyone that was following along on that stuff yesterday, so we're gonna take a look at"
"222210","227310"," this morning and just see that we traded higher than single digits here, so we're gonna get into it"
"227310","230630"," because we only got a few minutes until we open, and we're gonna get as caught up as to where"
"230630","235110"," the market is, what to expect for today and tomorrow, now one other thing I posted on Twitter was,"
"235410","244150"," oftentimes on OPEC states, you will see, I said, I think I said, I might have, I might have"
"244150","249450"," misworded what I was trying to say was that we have OPEC's today and tomorrow, and the market maker"
"249450","254710"," sometimes will make a huge move today and tomorrow and burn all of those options, believe it or"
"254710","259790"," not, and then you'll get your move on Thursday, and we'll look at the economic calendar here in a"
"259790","265070"," minute, I do want you to see ES this morning that we're down here with single points down below, we"
"265070","268610"," traded above that of course, I talked about this last night too, that we would get this bought up"
"268610","274810"," by open, and sure enough we did, and we should too, right, someone's gonna buy this bottom by the"
"274810","280310"," time after hours opens here, no one's gonna stay short down here, heading into today, Tuesday,"
"280510","283890"," they're gonna buy this bottom and hopefully make this run up and sure enough, that's what we did,"
"284430","290970"," now, value area low is 4.39 to 0.7, be aware of that, number two, this is an important"
"290970","297570"," number for you to know, and then we've got putting controls up here at 4504, this is about a 15 "
"297570","302670","-day chart, 15-minute chart, be aware of this as we move forward, that we don't have a ton of"
"302670","308490"," resistance heading up until we hit this 440 number, and we'll talk about retesting down below,"
"308750","313790"," we'll talk about what we talked about on Friday, we said on Friday we said, look, we broke below"
"313790","323170"," 4350 or 4352, and that would set up a test of lower numbers than at 420, we retested those numbers"
"323170","331570"," in futures over the weekend with horrible news, horrible news over the weekend, so for us to go"
"331570","337450"," back and retest that 420 again today or tomorrow, I was going to take an economic calendar,"
"337450","342410"," horrible news or more Russia horrible news for us to go back down there, but I'm assuming that a"
"342410","346790"," ton of you are like, hey, we're gonna go back and retest that, whatever, however deep we went, I"
"346790","351350"," think we went pretty, pretty low, so you know, you've got bears out there that are like, we were"
"351350","356390"," retesting that right off the bell today, we'll look at some of the charts and we'll talk about some"
"356390","362550"," of that this morning, if we do that this week or today on Monday, we go back and revisit those"
"362550","368590"," numbers, now the door for us to be open is for a break of that 420 number, we'll look at"
"368590","375490"," the exact numbers where we need to see a break, we didn't see a break of the previous low in"
"375490","384450"," futures, we were slightly higher, so technically we're not gonna see 410, 415, 400 yet until we see"
"384450","388970"," a cash market break of that previous low, so we'll look at that here in just a moment, I'm gonna"
"388970","394870"," turn this off here and we're gonna take a look at some other stuff here, so it's critical that you"
"394870","401010"," know that right, that the futures did not break that previous low, and that so far is showing a"
"401010","408790"," double bottom, it's not showing us a, it's not showing us so far that we have broken through and"
"408790","413790"," we're most definitely going down to C400, now there's some other requirements for us to head down"
"413790","419670"," lower, if we don't, if we don't retest that 420 and then if we bounce off of, I think it's"
"419670","425290"," 440 or somewhere in there, the 200 a moving average, yeah we can head back lower and retest again,"
"425290","431690"," right, we're always testing lows, we're always testing highs, now for today, for Tuesday, we know"
"431690","437270"," we had a home depot this morning, Macy's this morning, we've got huge reports this week, right,"
"437750","443470"," we've got over about 100, 150, 200 a day each day this week, we got some big ones coming up,"
"444070","448710"," we got Teladoc coming up, we've got Transocean, we got Caesars coming up today, we got lows"
"448710","452290"," tomorrow over stock, so we'll take a look at these tickers if we get a slow day at all, we've"
"452290","458230"," got Jack in the box, we got Molson cores, Boo Boo, remember how Samuel Adams did not fare well"
"458230","464510"," inside of their their reports, we've got Hertz skills, Hertz got run up, we've got eBay, Lemonade,"
"464950","470870"," a bunch of beaten down tickers, keep that in mind, some of these beaten down tickers, and someone"
"470870","476910"," put a list out over Twitter over the weekend, some of these tickers are down 80, 90%, 60, 70, 80,"
"477070","482370"," 90%, so if any of these guys hit good earnings, any of these guys come out with some with some"
"482370","486190"," good earnings, you're gonna see some ripper, some face rippers, I also want you to be aware of"
"486190","490970"," something on earnings this week, we got Coinbase, Alibaba, that's the you know all these beyond"
"490970","498190"," meat, wafer, rocket, I do want you to be aware of something that there is a program in this market"
"498190","507090"," or a basket of stocks for indexes that are being shorted by hedge funds, and then there are, they"
"507090","514770"," also have a basket of high risk, of high risk growth stocks that they're shorting as well, and then"
"514770","520570"," they pick certain ones that they remove their shorts off of and then they let them rip, and this is"
"520570","526830"," this basket of a mix between risk and bonds, so they're buying some bonds, they're shorting the"
"526830","532890"," market overall, but then they have this play money where they put into high risk trades, and these"
"532890","537990"," high risk trades believe it or not, are in these individual tickers that have been beaten down for"
"537990","542550"," the course of a year or two, and Shocker when you're seeing some of these stocks just rip out of"
"542550","549030"," nowhere, when you see a stock that just blows up, goes up like 30-40%, that's typically one of"
"549030","556050"," these big hedge funds that are lifting their shorts and trading them up for fast money, so I think"
"556050","560650"," we are set up for some of that this week with some of these reports we have this week, so"
"560650","564530"," we'll pay attention to see if some of these start to pop off, and if they do start to pop"
"564530","569030"," off as the week goes on, you're going to see a bid in some of these companies just on that"
"569030","573550"," information heading forward, so we keep an eye on that as the week moves forward, the economic"
"573550","579130"," calendar this week, we have got the case Shiller Home Price Index, on Tuesday we've got, excuse me,"
"579170","586530"," Monday we're closed of course, we had the case Shiller Home Index this morning, we've got the PMI"
"586530","594770"," Flash, consumer confidence at 10am, so we still have some, some volatility between 930 let's say"
"594770","601930"," and 10am, but Wednesday we've got nothing scheduled, unless we get some bad Russia news, you might"
"601930","606990"," be setting up for some kind of a move here, right, move higher I believe honestly, on Thursday"
"606990","613570"," we've got claims, this is all bad stuff, right, GDP, bad stuff, we've got personal income, bad"
"613570","620450"," stuff, PCE, no-go, right, this is all inflation kind of stuff, core inflation monthly, we've got"
"620450","624370"," real disposable income, these are all the bad ugly numbers for Friday, right, the pair is going to"
"624370","633050"," be looking for us to sell down by at least Friday over here, and this is the 25th, but we're"
"633050","638110"," going to talk about how the market swings high, swings low, and where we are in that movement here,"
"638230","641570"," okay, so I have a feeling that we're going to swing up this week, that could be wrong on this,"
"641690","646290"," even if we do a retest, but there's a fair chance that we make a move higher for a rejection"
"646290","650910"," point to trade lower again, believe it or not, so we're going to get out of the economic calendar"
"650910","656250"," for right now, we're going to go into the spot camera report, futures in there are $4.33, $5 up"
"656250","661670"," from overnight lows of $4, $2, $4, $9, our models look for continued volatility with resistance at"
"661670","668010"," $4,400, so keep that one up, $4,400 is basically your 200MA or simple moving average on a daily"
"668010","675650"," chart, right, support is at $4,300 and $4,270, our current view remains in line with that of"
"675650","680170"," Friday, we see a little reason for risk on a large rally, and a red drought brought into this"
"680170","686010"," clarity on interest rates, latest possible date, FOMC March 15, geopolitical headlines are"
"686010","689730"," certainly taking us on a stage of the moment, we feel their impact is being exasperated by large"
"689730","696470"," negative gamut and elevated implied volatility, we'll find on this simply because it's through this"
"696470","701070"," view that we feel that any rally is simply short covering, right, we talk about that, right, that"
"701070","705570"," we're not getting that huge banner rally, we're just getting shorts covering, the rallies are"
"705570","711410"," short, they don't last for two, three days, they last sometimes for just an hour, two hours, and"
"711410","716670"," then they start re-shorting again, right, rallies can reverse great speed as the feedback loop"
"716670","722290"," reverses, killer short V and negative gamma, put buying increases IV, as IV increases, the speed of"
"722290","727410"," these V put the feedback loop's increase, that is a key note right here, the speed of the feedback"
"727410","732910"," loop increases to the downside, to this point if you think about the 50 day hit a rally in Friday"
"732910","736190"," or here on the cater a real time after this full side rally was spurred on through traders selling"
"736690","742310"," put options, right, closing their shorts, closing their puts, right, and then we get a lift up in"
"742310","747250"," the market with implied dealers could buy back futures, right, this implied that there was could"
"747250","752170"," buy back futures, this forced covered spurs on second order effects cam event that this short cover"
"752170","756270"," rally faded quickly though at 3 p.m, we saw that as well on Friday, matter of fact I think"
"756270","761450"," we saw this on Thursday as well, today's updated open interest data confirms, confirmed puts were"
"761450","766710"," closed, as we saw net put position closures for all strikes in the spy, greater than the 435 and"
"766710","768210"," SPX greater than 4,400."
"768850","773470"," Perry wanted to zoom out on the intraday feedback loop's base and equity help models pose below, we"
"773470","777590"," can see how the rate of SPX gamma changes below the nodes which appear as small peaks indicate"
"777590","783030"," where there may be a large change in SPH S&P gamma which believe signals material change and risk,"
"783470","787050"," hedging points, thinking about like a hedging band, at the strikes we've printed on the chart we"
"787050","791730"," believe support resistance forms, you typically watch chart during periods of high volatility as it"
"791730","796650"," showed great accuracy in previous drawdowns, we posted this chart because we think it's the best to"
"796650","802130"," pick the large amount of gamma at the 4,000 strike, now we talked about this last week right, last"
"802130","807090"," few weeks maybe four weeks we've been talking about hey look this is where they're re hedging, this"
"807090","812390"," is where they're rolling hedges, we know that right now they're pretty much from March 18th that"
"812390","819330"," all the money is right around 4 or 15 or so, okay for this March 18th expiry, we know that"
"819330","823490"," a lot of the puts have been actually rolled out to May, that doesn't mean they don't print out into"
"823490","829650"," March, whether the March 4, 15's and 4, 10's don't print out this week, but we know that we've been"
"829650","835650"," watching this before this has been commented on by SPOT gamma, okay, the large amount of gamma at 4 "
"835650","841150",",000 strike being sale large the note is just under 4,050, we believe this is material long-term"
"841150","847110"," support, strictly through an options positions lens, we take a material change in policy, not just"
"847110","852110"," narrative punch through that level, now this is just like the reverse if you're a bull, if you're"
"852110","859450"," looking at the high strikes right and in call options, we'll be looking for those strikes down the"
"859450","863890"," road as we trade higher, right now we're in this negative gamma, we're in bears buying tons of"
"863890","870930"," protection, so we're looking lower now to hit those strikes as time moves forward, and we've had"
"870930","876190"," that proven week out, week in, week out, and until we get some kind of material change, we're not"
"876190","882150"," just outside of negative gamma, but you're seeing long calls, long dated, much higher strikes be"
"882150","888910"," purchased out, let's say we start buying 4,60's, 4,70's, 4,80's for 60's for this month, 4,70's"
"888910","894850"," for next month, 4,80's for April, you would then see a switch in that regime, but we're not doing"
"894850","899270"," that, we're doing the inverse of that, right, so we're looking lower over time, to know you're not"
"899270","904770"," getting 400 today, know you're not getting 390 today, it's going to go up and down as we make our"
"904770","910370"," way lower, right, so we also be aware that it's part of the ship posting over the weekend, so"
"910370","917590"," should concrete and positive new emerge from positive news, I guess emerged from Ukraine, then we"
"917590","922410"," could see a strong multi-day rally into the 4500 area, so we're going to pay attention to that,"
"922490","926970"," right, we're going to need to open up at some point today, I got a couple different streams on"
"926970","930430"," another computer here that I'll keep open all day long, I'm going to have to also rely upon you"
"930430","934990"," guys out there to be aware of any kind of positive news, even if it's not, even if it hasn't"
"934990","941190"," been confirmed yet, to at least be aware of a possible Ripperorn rally, and even though you say"
"941190","947830"," this can't happen, I'm telling you, they will scan this market up and down wherever they can,"
"948290","955070"," remember the time when Biden was going to talk at 4pm, the market just rallied, right, hard and"
"955070","962290"," heavy on that speech, then he had another speech and it did dumped, right, so be aware of news that"
"962290","967930"," can come out, that can imply a move higher to 4500, and is that above this line where positive"
"967930","972790"," gamma forms, we consider that major resistance, I don't think we get to this 4500 to be honest with"
"972790","977570"," you, but anything can happen, so if you keep this on your plate, if you're a bear to be really"
"977570","982990"," cautious, let's say we're trading down at a moment in the market, and we're at some form of a"
"982990","988210"," support level, and you hear some kind of news come out that Biden's going to speak for some kind of"
"988210","993430"," nonsense with the UN or NATO, there's a fair chance that they're going to flip the script on that,"
"993490","998710"," interpret that news as positive and cover their shorts, okay, just be conscious of that, I'll roll"
"998710","1003070"," through this, you can always come back into this video, pause it, come back, and take a look at"
"1003070","1012150"," these defined levels on, and gamma, gamma zones inside of ES, QQQs and the small caps in here,"
"1012310","1017090"," okay, so I'll scroll through this to the end, so we kind of get the information that we need to"
"1017090","1022590"," know right on the top up here, right, we know resistance is at 4400, we know that supports that"
"1022590","1030849"," lies at 4300, we know we've got 4270 as well, and we'll identify that as well, and we already saw"
"1030849","1035109"," that on the market profile, right, we've got single prints and then we've got some resistance above"
"1035109","1040790"," at 4400, and we're going to confirm all this once we turn on book map, we're going to look at"
"1040790","1046230"," book map and see where real support is, and where real real resistance is within the market today,"
"1046770","1050150"," so we're going to get rid of this right now, I just want to show you over the weekend over"
"1050150","1057930"," here on this ES chart over here, that we did not retest the lows down below, and just be conscious"
"1057930","1067550"," of this, okay, this low down here is 4213, okay, we broke 4520, excuse me,"
"1067550","1073530"," 4500, I thought that's wrong, but I think it's 4520 on Thursday or Friday of last week over here,"
"1073810","1081630"," and we broke this, right, it demanded that we go down and retest these lows down here at 4213, we"
"1081630","1090610"," tried to do that with all the bears, I'm going to tell you, we're going to retest this in cash"
"1090610","1095270"," market, but even if we do, we're going to need some nasty news to go down and actually break"
"1095270","1102050"," through, believe it or not, this point is 4213, and this is the 200A moving average, you can see"
"1102050","1107790"," right now that it's up around 4423.75, I'm going to assume that once we get into this cash market,"
"1107910","1113610"," this is going to roll down somewhere around this 4400, so that would imply, right, that maybe we"
"1113610","1118530"," come back and we would say, hey, we'll retest the low back here, we can't, right, we maybe can't, I"
"1118530","1123690"," guess we could retest it here, and then we're going to probably trade up to this 4400, and then"
"1123690","1130750"," look for more shorts to re-enter to come back down and trade this 4213, now this could also take"
"1130750","1135850"," two three days, right, this could take like burning opexes, make a maybe a run up for Wednesday"
"1135850","1142910"," here to this 4400, and then we trade back down on bad news Thursday and Friday, as much on unknown"
"1142910","1149630"," news we don't have, we could possibly trade down right off the bell doom and gloom today, to make a"
"1149630","1154930"," rip higher to 4400, we'll just watch the open this morning, see what winds up happening off the"
"1154930","1158750"," open this morning, but this is pretty much your trading zone, it gets a real basic way of looking"
"1158750","1164370"," at your trading zone, right, and if we break below, we all know that if we do this retest in"
"1164370","1174170"," cash market, or if we break below here, only then does that open up lower numbers, you"
"1174170","1180950"," can't open up down below unless you retest and break this support down here, if this support down"
"1180950","1187750"," here is tested, and it holds, right, we got a big nice crown formation, right, and that's going to"
"1187750","1192050"," set us up to rip higher, you don't want us if you're a bear, you don't want to see this"
"1192050","1198530"," zone hold, okay, because it will want to take now take another look higher, so ultimately with the"
"1198530","1203790"," other bears, the market does want to see in cash market another retest down below at this 420, we"
"1203790","1208330"," will more than likely get it, I don't know that we get it right now at this moment, maybe we"
"1208330","1214910"," do, my thought process is that we trade sideways, if I had to guess right now we trade sideways,"
"1215590","1221590"," we're going to make a move higher into Wednesday, and then we'll eventually with Thursday, Friday"
"1221590","1227570"," retest this low, and possibly even begin to make our way lower from there, now we're going to also"
"1227570","1232350"," look once more, we're going to look at the cash market on the spy, you can see we're trading inside"
"1232350","1238490"," of this, on this bullish, believe it or not, this bullish, this bullish megaphone, I guess you"
"1238490","1244250"," could call it, you can see the buys that came into the market this morning actually, I haven't"
"1244250","1249830"," looked at this chart yet, but you can see down here, boom, we bounced right off 428, 24, and after"
"1249830","1253890"," hours, and we got a big buy down here and a big buy down here as well, so just be"
"1253890","1258830"," conscious of this, see this sideways movement though, see this sideways movement back in the 14th,"
"1258990","1262970"," this is kind of what I'm talking about, right, you do kind of drifting sideways, then boom, we"
"1262970","1266850"," shoot up for the next two, three days, this is kind of what I think is going to happen, we're"
"1266850","1272470"," going to make this sideways movement over here, right, lay my hair, make this kind of sideways"
"1272470","1278010"," movement, then we boom, make it move up into Wednesday, then we start trading down again, unless we"
"1278010","1282250"," get some bad news, so we're going to pay attention to any kind of bad news that come in, any"
"1282250","1286850"," kind of setups for bears to get short in here, if I was a bear, right, and if I am"
"1286850","1290290"," a bear, I'm going to be looking to not, I don't want to take this short right here, I want"
"1290290","1294230"," to take this short somewhere up in this zone up here, I want to wait for us to get around"
"1294230","1298850"," 440, and then I want to take a nice fat short up here, right, and I want to run this"
"1298850","1304210"," down to 420, if I don't know, maybe bears are saying I don't care, I just want all this, I"
"1304210","1308810"," think that more than likely a bear that's like, oh, I want it to drop today, it's probably upside"
"1308810","1313650"," down in their shorts at this point, or I don't know what they're thinking, but I guess we could"
"1313650","1318190"," just fall off today, we need some bad news, otherwise a bear that's looking to make max gains, is"
"1318190","1322570"," going to wait for this to trade higher for another move down, and we might not get this high, we"
"1322570","1327190"," might not get up to 440, we might get some kind of bad news along the way, so we're going"
"1327190","1331490"," to turn this off, we got what, four minutes left until the opening bell, hope this guy is helping"
"1331490","1339430"," you this morning, as we move forward, I'm going to turn on, what am I turning around here, book"
"1339430","1344510"," map, and we'll look for the opening bell, my thought process this morning is, it's not going to be"
"1344510","1350110"," a short covering rally, I think you're going to see a lot of bears load up on the bell today,"
"1351070","1354950"," I think you're going to see a lot of bulls load up on the bell today, I think the market"
"1354950","1360310"," makers are going to take all that money in today, and that they'll make a move later, I think it'll"
"1360310","1365630"," drift higher over the next two or three days, and to Wednesday, excuse me, today, Tuesday, and"
"1365630","1370550"," Wednesday, it'll drift higher into that 440 zone, I'm adding an extra day to the week here, we'll"
"1370550","1375370"," drift higher to 440, if we get no bad news, I'm going to also try to monitor, or maybe you"
"1375370","1379250"," guys should be monitoring CNBC, if they start coming out and acting all stupid bulls or something,"
"1379690","1384550"," or the market's going to be okay, anything kind of nonsense like that, you might see the market"
"1384550","1390110"," drift higher today, tomorrow, and then you look for a Thursday or Wednesday into the closed short"
"1390110","1399950"," for a Wednesday into Thursday, short into, you know, into Thursday, Friday, for us to start"
"1399950","1403250"," selling this market again, am I saying that right?"
"1403970","1412010"," I'm thinking that today, Tuesday into Wednesday closed, that we go higher, and then maybe Thursday"
"1412010","1420400"," open into Friday, we start to sell once again, so if that helps all of you out there, but it"
"1420400","1426480"," could be a nice run for, it could be a nice run for bulls, and then the only other thing"
"1426480","1431040"," I would say on the Russia, the whole, we'll talk about Russia later once the market opens, we've"
"1431040","1434880"," only got two minutes until the open here, so we'll get loaded up here for all of you guys out"
"1434880","1442260"," there out there right now, paying it, or tuning in this morning, so make sure you guys, you guys"

"1461120","1465860"," something for it, so we'll take a look here, let's take a look at the last couple minutes before,"
"1466020","1476580"," for the bell and see where real support lies on, see if we can get some, let's"
"1476580","1480560"," see if we got real, we've got one more minute left here before we open, we're gonna take a look"
"1480560","1491120"," at where real support lies this morning, and uh, see here, come on now, here indicator, we'll"
"1494220","1503200"," close this up, take a look here, it's just, I gotta get, I gotta get it situated myself because"
"1503200","1513200"," I've got uh, some trades I think I want to take today, just"
"1513200","1520280"," remember, remember that it's classic for long weekends, for options to get burned, who I posted"
"1520280","1527980"," about this, I talked about this on Friday, you guys uh, I also posted about, so you make it a"
"1527980","1535780"," retest right now down to let's say 42776, might be a possibility, so we'll take a look at that"
"1535780","1542360"," level there, and we'll see right off the bell here, if there's any kind of a retest right off the"
"1542360","1549140"," bell, kind of a fake out move, so you can see it down here, right, see the lower band of"
"1549140","1554940"," this, of this volatility coming off the bell right here, is right down at that 42750 right in that"
"1554940","1563150"," channel where we are, so you guys can see that right, maybe we get that nice little retest down"
"1563150","1569310"," below, and it might be a buying opportunity here, take a look, uh, the bell is open at this point,"
"1571150","1580560"," so I get this to widen out a little bit, but I do want you to be aware of, I've"
"1580560","1587520"," made another post, there's a little bit of sellers right off the bell here at 43343, I do want to"
"1587520","1594240"," talk to you guys about long weekends too, this doesn't always happen, but sometimes you'll also see"
"1595600","1603440"," not only the option burned from that weekend, but you'll see, like the people loading up on the"
"1603440","1613320"," Tuesdays and the Thursdays, and you won't always see major moves, but with no news on Wednesday, we"
"1613320","1618400"," might get a move, we might get a move earlier, I didn't consider that when I made that comment, uh,"
"1618500","1625260"," that the way the economic calendar is working out, you saw a big buy this morning in, in, uh, after"
"1625260","1630760"," hours, hopefully we can get another retest down below, that's a, I'm assuming that that's a poll"
"1630760","1636440"," they're hoping for this morning, is for at least a retest down to, uh, 427. "
"1639820","1645120"," Yeah, let's not have Joe, good morning Joe, let's not have these extended three-day weeks again or"

"1783400","1788280"," 30 second delay, uh, I have to, I have to do a bunch of stuff, I have to still, I"
"1788280","1794780"," still haven't signed up for the 1080 60 frames per second in discord, but that's next, that's,"
"1794780","1795280"," that's today."
"1799260","1809040"," Let me see here, trade the news, we'll turn on Charlie so he can talk to us this"
"1809040","1811260"," morning and see what his points are."
"1811900","1818440"," Looks like we're trading down off the bell, gonna do that retest down below, I'm assuming that the"
"1818440","1822900"," bears think we're trading all the way down to, uh, I forget what we talked about where that was,"
"1823040","1823180"," right?"
"1823440","1833040"," The overnight low was down around, where do we say that was, where is the, where was the"
"1833040","1833840"," overnight low?"
"1843500","1848460"," For the over weekend low, I can clear this real quick. "
"1853670","1863350"," So the overnight low is 4253 low, maybe it's slightly lower, that is like 424925 somewhere in"
"1863350","1863490"," there."
"1864390","1869670"," So we'll see if it retests that, the bears want to retest that for sure today, I don't think we'd"
"1869670","1874190"," get that low, I think we'd only get down to 427 if we're lucky."
"1874690","1883140"," I think at most we get out of 42750 or so, wherever that, get this to sign in here. "
"1884800","1890700"," I don't think bears get that lucky today, I think bears wish they get that lucky today."
"1895390","1903850"," Let me see here, can we just second, let's turn this on, maybe, I guess you can't say never, you"
"1903850","1905310"," can just say maybe they do."
"1910290","1912010"," Looking for lower lows today. "
"1919130","1923830"," Long puts from Friday, that's all I ever see when I hear stuff like that."
"1927470","1933910"," That's all I hear, all I hear is I'm, I'm long puts and they're burning, so please give me lower"
"1933910","1934510"," lows today."
"1938050","1940910"," Okay, so let's look below and see where we tagged. "
"1941930","1944630"," We'll end up tagging down here at 4309."
"1945890","1949970"," We'll take another look lower here and see if we do even get down here."
"1950870","1958570"," There's a little bit of that, this buyers are down here at 428, it's like there's some ice down"
"1958570","1963750"," here at 428, so we'll see if those buyers just moved up at this point. "
"1964810","1969210"," I've got bears already stepping in off the bell this morning, let's talk about where we got for"
"1969210","1970370"," trades off the bell."

"2151270","2156130"," today, I feel like here we're going more, we'll take a look down below and see if there's any other"
"2156130","2160910"," areas to look at, it does look like we've got buyers down here, you have 50,000 buyers down here,"
"2160990","2170730"," 430, you got another 75 down here, and 428, you got another 100 down here at 426, 64, looks like"
"2170730","2177410"," we've got some pretty, this is a rug pull, looks like pretty firm support, your next price target"
"2177410","2186770"," down below before 2652 for major support area, then you've got light support at 424.99, and then"
"2186770","2190130"," you've got major support, which already know about down at 420. "
"2192110","2197430"," So we'll keep that in mind, and then we'll look above as well from this point, and see we've got"
"2197430","2206030"," some resistance above here at 433.36, let's see where the major sellers are, you can see them up"
"2206030","2216010"," here at 433.50 ready to step in above, 434,"
"2216010","2217810"," some nasty sellers up here, right?"
"2217950","2219070"," They don't even want to hear about 440."
"2221210","2224030"," They're like, hell no, you need some good news to get up here at 440."
"2224670","2229250"," So the bears are saying, no, we're not getting up there today, we're going to sell even earlier,"
"2230090","2232090"," that's what, it looks like the bears are saying that, right?"
"2232230","2242170"," That they're going to be selling even earlier, I don't know resistance above here"
"2242170","2257890"," at this 433.38, 433.38. Yeah,"
"2257950","2259730"," that's right where our opening bell was, right?"
"2259930","2263570"," So bears are wanting to step in right away this morning, they don't want to give any kind of a"
"2263570","2264790"," respite to the bulls. "
"2265090","2269190"," I haven't taken any positions yet, by the way, if you're wondering, I want to wait for this news to"
"2269190","2273450"," come out between now and 10 a.m. And so we can get any of this volatility out of the"
"2273450","2273630"," way."
"2273890","2279090"," We've got 18 minutes left until 10 a.m. to get an answer on any kind of bad news."
"2280570","2284310"," We did have dip buyers step in this morning and after hours. "
"2284970","2291290"," And if you're a bear, the sell, like in the futures market, you already made your money, you ran,"
"2291470","2291650"," right?"
"2292210","2297450"," And if you're looking for your next place to take a short, the recommendation, of course, is"
"2297450","2297890"," higher."
"2298110","2299230"," It's somewhere around this 440."
"2299930","2303230"," Possibly, we've got some resistance of area zones above. "
"2303430","2313330"," We've got 43456, we've got 43737, we've got 43861, we've got 43981,"
"2313910","2317470"," 441.98, we've got a bunch of resistance above."
"2317950","2319690"," It's just a matter of where do you take your short?"
"2320030","2321190"," Where do you buy your puts?"
"2322810","2324350"," And do you enter earlier?"
"2324470","2325930"," Do you enter later?"
"2327050","2330710"," So my take on this is that it's going to be later."

"2805210","2808790"," It's funny though, the brokerage that they got into and took money from was Robinhood."
"2809730","2812770"," This was, I want to say it was like three years ago, two or three years ago."
"2813690","2816190"," They broke into Robinhood and how they got into Robinhood. "
"2816370","2821070"," They got into my, they first got into my, I had a debit card through Robinhood."
"2821970","2825070"," And I don't know how they got my, I don't know if I got, I don't know if I was"
"2825070","2825690"," using it."
"2825930","2830130"," I had blamed it on Wall Street, but it wasn't sure if they were used, if I wasn't sure if"
"2830130","2832410"," it was a card reader that it was caught on. "
"2832790","2837610"," And I wasn't sure if it was something that I ran it on because I was like at that time"
"2837610","2841830"," I was spending like 10, see the max that you can spend on your debit card every week."
"2841830","2843210"," It's like 15 grand or something."
"2843850","2845610"," And I'd like, I'd use it. "
"2845610","2848650"," Like I'd run it for like 10 grand, 15 grand, 5 grand."
"2848850","2850390"," I don't know if it's 5, 10 or 15 grand."
"2850530","2853110"," I don't remember what it was, but I would run it. "
"2853330","2856490"," Let's say if I was going like an Airbnb or something or if I was going on a trip."
"2857590","2859510"," And I was using it actively."
"2860050","2861630"," And that's how it started. "
"2861910","2868390"," It started with my card being run and eventually it got into the account."
"2868610","2869690"," I didn't notice it right away."
"2870610","2876010"," And so from that point forward, I've tried to limit how much people know about me. "
"2876430","2878070"," There's a few of you out there actually know who I am."
"2878170","2878950"," There's a few of you out there."
"2879290","2882890"," There's a very small select few of you that have some of my personal information. "
"2884290","2891850"," I know that I've shown some of these documents to Quinn and Joe Donut."
"2891970","2896330"," I know some of you have my personal phone number so you can deduce who I am that way."
"2896930","2899910"," But I trust the ones that know who I am out there. "
"2911130","2915590"," When I post trading view charts on Captain's Alpha, why don't you provide attribution?"
"2917230","2918270"," What do you mean by attribution?"
"2918590","2921210"," I don't know what attribution means."
"2924110","2925490"," Do you use it in the script right?"
"2926130","2927230"," I don't know what you mean by that."
"2927850","2928410"," Anyway, I stopped. "
"2928530","2929430"," It's really weird too."
"2929750","2933170"," I used to do a bunch of trading view charting."
"2934950","2941110"," I used to do a bunch of trading view charts back in the day, but not. "
"2942010","2943370"," You mean like links?"
"2943630","2946210"," I used to do like trading view charts where I provide links to stuff."
"2949790","2951730"," And I have a trading view account."
"2952250","2952730"," You know, it's weird. "
"2952850","2953910"," The way the market is right now."
"2954530","2956430"," It's not really the market's really not set up."
"2956810","2957890"," Oh, like the URL to the chart. "
"2958250","2959130"," Yeah, I used to do that."
"2959590","2961950"," So I used to do a, you know, do it more."
"2961950","2964010"," So I've done those charts are all mine. "
"2966330","2970970"," I used to do URLs to the trading view charts and then the way the market has flipped heading from"
"2970970","2971910"," like September, October."
"2972470","2973890"," I did a video back in September."
"2974530","2974970"," I don't know. "
"2975070","2976230"," Some of you guys have been following a long time."
"2976390","2977750"," So like back in September, I did this."
"2979210","2986970"," I did a chart back in September or a video back in September where I said this is the time"
"2986970","2987330"," to sell. "
"2988290","2990210"," And I talked about Apple staying higher."
"2990550","2992370"," I talked about though, taking your money and running."
"2992550","2994110"," We're more than 20 minutes into the trading session. "
"2994350","2996530"," We're seeing a rally in U.S. equity futures."
"2996790","2998970"," The S&P is now up about 10 handles on the day."
"2999110","3000890"," Then as that composite up 40 points. "
"3001850","3005090"," And we down 75, but recouping good portion of the early losses."
"3005990","3011070"," The VIX is now at 28.98 up about 4% on the day, but 9% from where we"
"3011070","3013850"," opened down 9% from when we opened in the VIX."
"3014330","3018030"," Yeah, VIX was up to 31.80, but it's now falling off right now. "
"3018030","3021010"," The market is holding above 1900 up about a quarter percent today."
"3023760","3027280"," I used to do those videos or excuse me, I used to do charts that were attributed."
"3027600","3033480"," But for me personally, I don't feel confident telling you guys, hey, you should be buying right"
"3033480","3033760"," now. "
"3034120","3040380"," And I won't make those charts again until you'll start to go back into that shift back into that"
"3040380","3041200"," when I think we're done."
"3041200","3044660"," But I don't think we're done selling this market as of yet."
"3045080","3051340"," When I feel confident with reinvesting in this market, which I think happens sometime in probably a"
"3051340","3053440"," nice buy in Ram March. "
"3054060","3064660"," And then I take profit and there's probably another deep buy in sometime in May, maybe"
"3064660","3065040"," June."
"3066840","3069920"," There's like March is probably a good buy in multi charts for March."
"3070020","3075420"," And then there's another chart or there's another buying opportunity sometime in May, maybe into"
"3075420","3075960"," June. "
"3076540","3081100"," And then there's probably another take profit scenario between then and August."
"3081820","3085940"," And there's even another sell, deep sell into more than likely into fall."
"3087140","3089880"," And they will buy again for Christmas rally. "
"3090860","3092360"," But I don't feel confident right now."
"3092880","3096400"," I don't want you guys to be like, I don't want to be the guy out there being like, yeah,"
"3096700","3101840"," buy PayPal right now or buy Facebook and it dumps another 20%."
"3101840","3105800"," My viewpoint is that I'm seeing some spy puts come in right now. "
"3107540","3110380"," Spy puts February 22nd for 30 P."
"3111480","3115960"," $35,000, $48,000 and then $157,000."
"3116680","3121560"," Lots of IWM calls coming in right now just rolling through more spy puts February 22nd."
"3121560","3127580"," $434 P for $1,000 just day traders watching lots of day traders by high. "
"3127640","3138080"," I'm calls February 23rd 200 C, $300,000, $128,000, $25,000, $140,000, $90 "
"3138080","3144360",",000, basically a little bit over a million bucks on IWM February 23rd 200 C."
"3146220","3151640"," So yeah, I don't feel confident with saying to you guys, hey, these, so I've got all these stock."
"3152640","3159080"," I've got these Finviz stock pickers that I've been using for a bunch of years and none of them are"
"3159080","3161120"," coming up as buy right now, like none of them."
"3161720","3167720"," The only thing you can really confidently buy right now is basically commodities, energy, metals to"
"3167720","3168020"," an extent. "
"3168880","3171220"," And I don't personally like trading those."
"3173160","3176720"," Maybe I could spend more time on energy or on metals."
"3177280","3184260"," My problem with that is that they always seem to be, you get a caught in the down cycles of"
"3184260","3184880"," those trades. "
"3185800","3192940"," I typically tend to short the market and then buy the rips and looking for entries for a bottom of"
"3192940","3193240"," the market."
"3198490","3198990"," Good morning, everybody."
"3199190","3199570"," Good morning, Brad. "
"3207430","3211710"," I don't know, I think with the, I think of pound terrors that it's a, it's a buy and hold."
"3212030","3212750"," It always is."
"3215230","3216210"," Paletteers a buy and hold. "
"3219190","3226210"," It's the, my only problem I've ever had with pound terrors that it's a, it has some, it's a, it's"
"3226210","3227010"," a high float stock."
"3227250","3231250"," It's got, no, high float, but it's got, there's so many shares out there."
"3232610","3240070"," It's been, it's been diluted to such an extent that it's kind of, it's one of those things that you"
"3240070","3241230"," buy and you don't ever sell it. "
"3241410","3243930"," You just kind of hold on to it over five or ten years."
"3243930","3246710"," It's not something that I ever like or want to actively trade."
"3247550","3251270"," And they're going to fan of actively trading and it's something you just add to your collection and"
"3251270","3252150"," you don't mess with it. "
"3252910","3255950"," It reminds me a lot of like a Ford, right?"
"3255950","3260490"," If, I remember I sold a bunch of Ford stock when it was three bucks and I just didn't want"
"3260490","3263770"," to wait for six months a year, five years for it to trade higher."
"3264550","3268610"," That was a couple years ago, two, three years ago and it's traded much higher since then, but I'm"
"3268610","3270210"," not at that kind of investor investor."
"3271510","3274230"," I'm always looking to buy stocks that the banks are actively moving. "
"3275490","3282310"," Get the conference for data for February about a minute expected at 110 Richmond Fed, usually"
"3282310","3284070"," released early expected at 10."
"3285570","3289310"," So waiting for this 10 o'clock news to come out and then the news is over for the day,"
"3289310","3289650"," I think."
"3290750","3292610"," We should get some clear, much clearer direction. "
"3297480","3299180"," Richmond fed at one."
"3299960","3302960"," Well, the 10 expected Richmond Fed dropping to one from eight prior."
"3307610","3313170"," Look at the consumer competence reading for February and just a few seconds expect that 110. "
"3316510","3319390"," The actual is one versus 10 on the estimate."
"3324860","3331410"," We see volume of new orders minus three versus six prior."
"3332210","3334710"," Back hog of orders minus four versus two prior. "
"3340770","3341470"," This impacts the spy."
"3348380","3351100"," One hundred ten point five for consumer competence."
"3351100","3355640"," One hundred ten point five little above one hundred ten expectation present situation one forty"
"3355640","3358720"," five point one down from one forty eight point two prior. "
"3359420","3363700"," Expectations index slipping to eighty seven point five from ninety point eight prior."
"3364620","3365180"," Nope."
"3365180","3374810"," So it was one February consumer confidence was"
"3374810","3383030"," one ten versus the expected one sorry one ten point five versus one ten point zero expected. "
"3384530","3394170"," But the expect the expectations index was eighty seven point five versus ninety point zero the"
"3394170","3394510"," prior."
"3395470","3396990"," So it has gotten lower."
"3401740","3407020"," You see here present situation index one forty five point one versus one forty eight. "
"3407540","3408660"," Oh, wait a minute."
"3409460","3411080"," Revising this as they post it."
"3413000","3419320"," Those that are saying jobs are plentiful is fifty three point eight percent versus fifty five point"
"3419320","3420480"," zero percent prior. "
"3421320","3425940"," Those are saying jobs are hard to get his eleven points mixed bag on this."
"3425940","3430880"," Seven point eight percent versus twelve points twelve percent prior."
"3432560","3441000"," Prior consumer confidence revised lower to one eleven point one versus one thirteen point eight. "
"3441440","3448130"," So not the best numbers on the February consumer confidence."
"3450670","3452110"," Manufacturing looks like not."
"3452350","3453650"," I don't forget this wrong here. "
"3454410","3455690"," That's not that good either."
"3458080","3459500"," They still have no less."
"3459720","3460940"," Yeah, let me see if I read this wrong. "
"3464060","3466860"," Back like a board is minus four versus two prior."
"3467420","3468040"," Okay, that's good."
"3470420","3472200"," We're getting some weakness off this. "
"3472380","3473380"," Yeah, a little bit of weakness here."
"3481930","3485950"," Yeah, so James the my take on pound here is."
"3487630","3491190"," I think I've heard people saying we can link a pound here real quick. "
"3494410","3495670"," It's a it's a tough one."
"3495950","3500810"," You know, people like to day trade pounds here because of the rips that has had in the past timing"
"3500810","3501590"," those rips."
"3502410","3504110"," It reminds me of Ford, right?"
"3504370","3508290"," You kind of just buy it and hold it and you put it in your your portfolio. "
"3508810","3510350"," I think it's a better pick."
"3511310","3511850"," We should."
"3512890","3515190"," You know, there was a I saved. "
"3515570","3519310"," Let me see if I can bring this up, but someone did it really neat."
"3519630","3520350"," I remember that."
"3520490","3522130"," I forget who originally did it. "
"3522330","3523970"," It was stolen by a bunch of Twitter."
"3524630","3528770"," Finn Twitters and thrown around Finn Twitter on Sunday or Saturday."
"3529470","3534510"," But somebody put we're watching some spy puts come in Twitter puts come in Apple puts come in. "
"3534510","3537790"," The AC puts come in XLE puts come in."
"3537930","3538910"," That's a spy."

"3567470","3570830"," February 25th 44 P for $12,000."
"3571110","3574350"," XLE puts March 4th."
"3574350","3576290"," I don't know if it's in February 4th. "
"3576370","3581170"," I'm in March 4th and all those XLE 66 P for $6,000."
"3584770","3586510"," So we'll look at pounds ever quick."
"3587010","3589510"," There was a chart front around with all of these. "
"3590370","3596690"," All these speculative growth stocks that are down 60% there and 80% 90% and they were kind"
"3596690","3598690"," of abused and thrown around."
"3599250","3609170"," I saved the chart with all the names of these companies and there were."
"3609350","3612310"," There are some key things to look at on those companies. "
"3613590","3615790"," So one of my I'll talk to you guys."
"3615870","3617470"," This is a good thing to talk about right now actually."
"3617670","3618110"," Believe it or not. "
"3618130","3618950"," It's a good one to talk about."
"3619430","3619850"," So."
"3621250","3624230"," Ask you QQ calls February or excuse me. "
"3624290","3625470"," March 4th."
"3626550","3627510"," 44 C."
"3631000","3633520"," $167,000 that BAC put."
"3633800","3636360"," I miss miss spoke on. "
"3636620","3637380"," It's sorry."
"3637780","3638980"," The more came out on BAC."
"3639360","3643760"," We've got BAC January 20th 2023 40. "
"3643760","3647040"," P for $1.4 million."
"3648020","3649760"," The SQQ calls are high."
"3649900","3651540"," I'll go score March 4th. "
"3651800","3652400"," 44 C."
"3652820","3654040"," $167,000."
"3654280","3657180"," We'll get some calls on spy February 22nd for 35 C."
"3657820","3658540"," $95,000."
"3660000","3662440"," The market is neutral right now. "
"3662900","3665880"," So you've got a neutral call ratio."
"3666620","3668720"," 0.65 versus."
"3671320","3674100"," 0.65 as the call ratio. "
"3674460","3677500"," That 47,000 puts to 71,000 calls."
"3684750","3687950"," And I'm going to look at something real quick with you guys."
"3692230","3698930"," So basically what I'm always looking for in companies right is on that list that was thrown around"
"3698930","3699230"," Twitter. "
"3699470","3701710"," I'll post that right now on at Captain's Alpha that."
"3702470","3703430"," That guide."
"3704810","3706070"," And we'll talk about this right now. "
"3706070","3706390"," This is important."
"3706450","3708470"," People are wondering when they can start buying this market."
"3708870","3710050"," So Palantere real quick. "
"3710050","3710930"," We'll take a look at it right."
"3711730","3716050"," We know that that's got some semblance of support down at $10 and $8."
"3716430","3718730"," So we've got some support at $10 down here. "
"3723520","3724220"," 10 bucks."
"3724440","3727540"," And then we know that it can go down to eight or nine points, right?"
"3729420","3733960"," We've got buyers down at $9 down here."
"3734940","3736620"," So what do you do on a Palantere?"
"3737100","3739120"," I can chart this out for you guys and make a video. "
"3739760","3743360"," I get buyers at $8 and I'll show you how to buy any stock."
"3743560","3744780"," I've done videos on this in the past."
"3745240","3746140"," How to buy falling knives. "
"3747140","3748700"," How to look for a turn in the stock."
"3749780","3751020"," And it applies to Palantere as well."
"3752640","3755160"," I'm going to any stock and index. "
"3758540","3762340"," But I'll post this chart that came out on."
"3763600","3766220"," I'll post this chart that came out on Twitter over the weekend."
"3767760","3772360"," And so what I apply what I would apply to that chart that was given on it. "
"3772480","3775380"," I think it listed like maybe 90 or 300 tickers."
"3775540","3779380"," I don't know exactly how many it listed like 100 tickers or some nonsense like that."
"3779720","3780620"," They're all beaten down. "
"3780880","3784340"," So what you do is you take those tickers, right?"
"3784860","3786500"," And you're going to look for certain things."
"3786940","3793420"," If you're an investor, if I'm an investor and I want to buy speculative growth stocks, there's some"
"3793420","3794100"," things I'm looking for."
"3794260","3797380"," I'm looking for, so you're looking for the next Apple, right?"
"3797580","3798280"," And that's the plan, right?"
"3798600","3799140"," I want to buy Apple. "
"3799160","3799860"," You hear all these stories."
"3800340","3801700"," I heard this one guy this week on YouTube."
"3801700","3803800"," He was talking craziness to me. "
"3804060","3805440"," That shit craziness."
"3805540","3806440"," I had to turn the video off."
"3806540","3808460"," I turned it off because I was like, I don't want to hear this anymore. "
"3808460","3816220"," And his point was that he made it through two or three recessions with Apple."
"3817380","3821140"," And then he bought it before whoever and all kinds of fucking nonsense."
"3822180","3823200"," And you hear that. "
"3823380","3827700"," You always hear these antidotal comments from your secretary, Marcus trending."
"3827700","3830680"," Laura, once again, following the Richmond Fed print, we've seen the."
"3831300","3831980"," You hear these?"
"3832120","3832440"," You'll hear these. "
"3832520","3833740"," He's not down about four now."
"3833740","3836540"," The NASDAQ composite down 21 on the Dowdown 160."
"3838480","3839500"," You'll hear these nonsense. "
"3840200","3844720"," Crew features holding on to gains of about two and a quarter percent, but near their lowest levels"
"3844720","3845200"," of the day."
"3845220","3846820"," That's far for WTI crude."
"3848460","3853640"," You're going to hear these, answered, anecdotal comments and say to yourself, why didn't I ever"
"3853640","3854140"," catch that?"
"3854420","3856200"," Why didn't everybody Apple with two dollars?"
"3856600","3861440"," Why didn't I buy this company at a dollar and you know, why didn't I buy Tesla?"
"3861740","3862680"," You can just name them. "
"3862680","3866160"," And say, well, how, you know, what am I doing wrong in this situation?"
"3867220","3871200"," And of course, you know, people will think, Oh, well, that's just by Apple right where it's at"
"3871200","3871700"," right now."
"3872400","3873300"," And that's not true."
"3873480","3877260"," What you need to be looking, you need to be looking at this child post this chart here in a"
"3877260","3877480"," minute. "
"3877500","3882500"," What you need to do is apply some, some things to it, right?"
"3882580","3889200"," You want to apply things like, so you want the company to be have launched within the last three"
"3889200","3889620"," years, right?"
"3889620","3890820"," IPO'd last three years."
"3891160","3893100"," You're looking for companies that are new companies."
"3893300","3896240"," You want me looking at an Apple, you want me looking at a Tesla, you want me looking at a"
"3896240","3899800"," company that's opened, that's IPO'd publicly in the last three years. "
"3900200","3900240"," Okay."
"3900400","3907000"," So one to three years, you want to make sure that their float is over 5% right over 5 "
"3907000","3907700","% their float."
"3908860","3913900"," You want to make sure that they're above their 50 day simple moving average, right?"
"3914020","3916300"," We're not even going to enter and knife by these stocks yet. "
"3916300","3919780"," He's one that this chart I'll show you, you're not even going to buy him yet, right?"
"3920300","3923340"," You want them over their 200 SMA, which a bunch of them are right now."
"3924520","3930840"," So you want their IPO date in the last three years, you want to make sure that their average volume"
"3930840","3934700"," every day is over 500,000, right?"
"3935020","3935900"," You ready for this one?"
"3936000","3939420"," This is going to knock out half of the, well not half, this is probably knock out 95% of"
"3939420","3940680"," these companies are listed on this chart."
"3941220","3946840"," You want to make sure that their sale growth is 30% higher, quarter over quarter, per least three"
"3946840","3952600"," quarters, three straight quarters, even if they're tickers, trade and lower. "
"3953580","3955480"," Yeah, the sales growth rate, right?"
"3956000","3965520"," Then you want to make sure that their last three earnings reports, they had positive guidances."
"3965540","3970300"," That means you have to go then go into all these companies and review all of their guidance"
"3970300","3975580"," statements that they're making, they're profitable, they've been profitable and that they're"
"3975580","3978620"," guiding higher, even right now with everything being down."
"3979160","3985760"," That'll probably take out, I would say, I would bet you might get left with three to five tickers"
"3986380","3989040"," on that list that was published this weekend on Twitter. "
"3989440","3995360"," Maybe you might get 10, but that work that needs to go into looking at a hundred tickers is"
"3995360","3995760"," substantial."
"3995800","3999100"," Probably take an entire weekend to look at all those tickers."
"3999300","4002580"," I'm going to find that the chart rate and I'm going to post it on Twitter for you. "
"4004450","4010350"," I'm going to go to Twitter at Captain's Alpha, I'm going to post this chart that I'm talking about"
"4010350","4015830"," and you'd be surprised at what tickers will come up with that."
"4017010","4022530"," You'd be surprised with how many tickers it discludes that you're interested in."
"4022730","4026490"," You can just look at a pound tear, they don't meet those requirements. "
"4027850","4028730"," They don't."
"4029050","4029830"," I know they don't."
"4029870","4031530"," I know that they haven't had three positive quarters. "
"4032090","4032830"," I know that, right?"
"4032830","4037850"," The guidance is awesome, but they're not hitting 30% profits, right?"
"4038130","4042270"," And then the last thing would be if you really want to knock out, and let's say you left with"
"4042270","4044790"," 10 or 15 companies, you want the last killer?"
"4045350","4047450"," Last killer is Tam, right?"
"4049050","4057270"," You want to know about, you want to know about how much market to report here out of the ministry"
"4057770","4058550"," of Ukraine."
"4058550","4062110"," Ukraine is reportedly asked for the U.K. in the United States for more weapons."
"4062790","4063090"," Nice. "
"4064850","4065610"," I like it."
"4066550","4069510"," So I just posted on that Captain's Alpha this list, right?"
"4070010","4071850"," And then the last part would be their mark on capture."
"4071870","4074310"," It's being attributed to the U.K. foreign minister, Kuleba. "
"4076210","4079550"," So you're looking at, you're looking at, let's say, market capture."
"4080130","4085810"," So you're going to say to yourself, you're going to say to yourself, just like an apple, right?"
"4085810","4090390"," If you were to buy an apple at two bucks, what did apple do differently than everybody else, right?"
"4090510","4094170"," They had a closed garden economy, right?"
"4094430","4096010"," Everything was closed guard without it."
"4096069","4098390"," Did something different than all everybody else. "
"4098569","4099910"," They used their own operating system."
"4100330","4103430"," They said they were different than everybody else."
"4103770","4107870"," So you could target apple and say, yeah, they've got a great mark capture for doing their own thing"
"4107870","4108330"," over there. "
"4109149","4110930"," And that's how you target them, right?"
"4111270","4114609"," And they're going to capture a large percentage for themselves, right?"
"4114609","4116870"," Outside of what everybody else is doing."
"4117310","4122170"," And so I just posted the list that was passed around over the weekend on Twitter."
"4122550","4125830"," And I'm sure that if you go through all these companies, there's only a few that hit them. "
"4126609","4127410"," There's only a few."
"4127630","4132109"," Evenhood doesn't hit the profitability target, but they do have a great Tam, right?"
"4132609","4138689"," So you might find one to three companies on this list that have the potential to actually become an"
"4138689","4138870"," apple."
"4139229","4143370"," So when you hear that argument from Bull out there saying, well, I held through all these problems"
"4143370","4146450"," and I kept adding even when things are terrible. "
"4147010","4150870"," And even after three to five years, it kept going up and you know, you would have made turn $2"
"4150870","4154950"," into, you know, fucking $20,000, some fucking nonsense like that."
"4155370","4160270"," You still have to be selective in that 30 times growth narrative."
"4160270","4165029"," You still have to be selective when all these stocks are beaten down, what you're going to buy. "
"4165290","4171189"," And I guarantee if you look at this list and apply those concepts to it, you're going to get an"
"4171189","4171910"," answer that small."
"4171910","4176950"," You're going to get just a few companies on that list that you should be focused on targeting on."
"4177430","4183430"," And then from that point targeting, when do I actually start to catch knives on this company?"
"4184109","4186029"," And so they have done videos on how to do that too. "
"4186350","4190330"," So even when you get it down to picking those one to three companies or five companies off that"
"4190330","4195030"," list, you're then going to have to then apply when do we start to enter those tickers."
"4195430","4199310"," And I have recorded videos, not my daily streams, but I've got previous videos and before"
"4199310","4206270"," everything went to shit, where I show people how to catch knives, when to catch knives, I went to"
"4206270","4210590"," look for a turn in a ticker to start to enter to go long in it."
"4211310","4217330"," Now one other thing about this post that I just made on at Captain's Alpha, these tickers, there's"
"4217330","4218870"," another play in these tickers. "
"4219190","4223670"," And now this would be the merger and acquisition department."
"4223670","4229370"," And I should have brought this up, you know, and I didn't, I missed this."
"4229930","4234370"," So you know, the whole Peton, the whole Peton episode, right?"
"4234670","4236170"," Why is Peton going back up?"
"4236910","4243970"," And we should have, we should have kind of keyed into that activist investor that spoke up and just"
"4243970","4248910"," caused all that fucking ruckus and the stock shot back up and then it kept going up thereafter. "
"4250370","4255630"," And oftentimes, you know, I ended up watching this weekend, Carl Icahn's documentary on HBO, I"
"4255630","4257690"," think Jenny Marcus brought it up on Twitter."
"4258110","4262490"," So I ended up watching it this weekend and it gave up pretty much the same layout as to what's"
"4262490","4263210"," happened to Peton."
"4263710","4267950"," And the same thing with Biacom, you're going to look for some of these tickers that are getting"
"4267950","4274270"," really beat to shit and you're going to watch for investor and activist investors that are going to"
"4274270","4278070"," come in and they're going to do one of two things, they're either going to pump it up and you"
"4278070","4283230"," can enter for the, for wins or for gains off that, but know what you're getting into, right?"
"4283570","4288410"," Know that these companies are going to get either get merger or equity, or acquiesced. "

"4356190","4361850"," You can make those plays off these tickers, but they're not the apples that everybody talks about,"

"4513690","4514890"," No, I don't think it's weak."
"4515290","4520270"," I think you got, I went through this in my broadcast the earliest morning in the open, which was,"
"4520930","4530850"," you're, I think, usually, I'm assuming we got no pecs today, we got no pecs tomorrow, we've got no"
"4530850","4536170"," news on Wednesday, and you got to think of this in the perspective of a trader that makes money,"

"4559230","4563030"," You want, I want to short it at 440, that's where I want to short the market. "
"4563770","4569270"," So my hope is that we trade higher to 440, and then I can short it there, I don't want"
"4569270","4575950"," to enter a short or a long put right down here at 430, 49, hoping for 420, I want to"
"4575950","4578810"," get max gains, I want to, I want to make it max gain."
"4578970","4586470"," So I'm hoping that we trade up to near 440, if we even get up there, 436, 440, so that's"
"4586470","4587250"," what I'm looking for."
"4588330","4593510"," And I'm looking for the market to trade higher with no news tomorrow, we're not, we don't have any"
"4593510","4596550"," bad news coming until Thursday and Friday. "
"4597230","4604250"," That's when volatility enters the market, where you get the VIX here at 2839, are you expecting"
"4604250","4611350"," some VIX rip between now and Wednesday, it would have to be bad news from Russia to send us up"
"4611350","4612610"," to 3540."
"4613230","4620390"," So everything is adding up to us trading higher, the VIX going down slightly into Wednesday, excuse"
"4620390","4626490"," me, to Tuesday, Wednesday for the VIX to burn off a little bit, and then the VIX to move higher"
"4626490","4628050"," into Thursday, Friday."
"4629630","4633610"," So I think we roll over right now, it's possible, but it's risky as a bear. "
"4633910","4639010"," If you're a bearish, it's risky, this is like a, this is almost like a bull asking when you hit"
"4639010","4641070"," all time highs, should I buy calls right now?"
"4641630","4647350"," Fuck no, fuck no, you wait for a pullback, even if it even melts higher, you wait for a pullback"
"4647350","4649830"," because eventually you're gonna get burned, right?"
"4650070","4655570"," You're talking about like the law of averages, the law of good and bad trades, you know, if you're"
"4655570","4660350"," only winning one out of 10 trades or three out of 10 trades or six out of 10 trades, it's"
"4660350","4661870"," because you've taken trades like this."
"4662330","4667270"," It's because you've entered short right now, you can promise you that out of 10 trades, you might"
"4667270","4673430"," make seven of them, you might make six of them profitable when you really need to have a target of"
"4673430","4680790"," seven to nine profitable trades minimum, like seven to nine that are profitable to stay inside this"
"4680790","4686090"," market at all times, you need to be profitable, you need to make right trades, we're trading higher"
"4686090","4688910"," right now, 435 is zero."
"4689690","4695230"," So if you're a bear, you might miss some of them, but you are waiting until we trade higher,"
"4695870","4702270"," somewhere between 436 and 440, 4400 to take another short. "
"4702510","4706210"," And you can remember, you can even look back on last week, let's see the month chart on the spy,"
"4706750","4714670"," you can even see on what, we can look on February 9th into the 10th, we traded outside of our"
"4714670","4721950"," trading, right, we traded outside of our trading channel, right, and the best short take was above"
"4721950","4722350"," there."
"4722910","4728990"," So we could technically trade all the way up to 450 on good news, and then that's where the short"
"4728990","4729330"," is."
"4729510","4734150"," So if we're talking about taking a short today, we talked about this for after the bell, I think"
"4734150","4738010"," it's insane to take a short, take a short off the bell this morning. "
"4738410","4742930"," I think that the logical thing is a bear is that you wait first to trade higher to 440."
"4744410","4750450"," Spock Emma said this morning, that there's even a potential for 450, if you hear some kind of"
"4750450","4755790"," stupid like a cord or we're going to meet for any kind of nonsense like, oh, we're going to reopen"
"4755790","4764270"," negotiations for a summit of some kind, any kind of bullshit like that, you'd take that short"
"4764270","4769610"," position, or excuse me, we could trade higher from there to 450 easily on the table, if you hear"
"4769610","4773610"," any kind of nonsense like that, then we trade higher between 440 and actually 450."
"4774290","4778090"," I don't think we'll get that high, but if you want to take a short position, for me, I'm going"
"4778090","4784690"," to be waiting for somewhere between 436 and 440 between today and tomorrow. "
"4786410","4787530"," That's that's my plan."
"4792400","4793660"," Hey, Stephen, how are you?"
"4794080","4804020"," Hi, so yeah, so Stephen, I want you to know that I want you to know, Stephen, that YouTube is"
"4804020","4813440"," hiding, YouTube is hiding people that don't roll themselves into their money making scheme, not"
"4813440","4820240"," scheme, but if I don't, if so I don't, my broadcasts or Twitter or YouTube has asked me to join"
"4820240","4826640"," into their like money making, like add advertising and also their nonsense, and if I don't join"
"4826640","4830800"," into that stuff, they hide my channel, which is fine, I'm fine with that."
"4831360","4839380"," I don't need 1000 years, I just need my, my friends. "
"4848490","4855050"," I used to do, I used to, all right, I tried to clip these moments, and YouTube doesn't allow me"
"4855050","4859030"," to, on live streams, they're like six to eight hours, I can't go in and edit them."
"4859650","4863970"," That's why sometimes I delete these videos, if I posted some personal information by accident,"
"4864550","4869290"," sometimes I'll delete a video fully, they used to allow you to go in and edit them, but now you"
"4869290","4869570"," cannot."
"4870330","4874250"," So I have to do more recorded videos with these moments. "
"4875490","4878210"," I used to do a lot of them, but the way the market's been trading, it's been wild."
"4879110","4882990"," I used to do just recorded videos, and then the way this market's been trading, I've decided to"
"4882990","4887010"," come on live because people are getting smoked, they're getting wrecked, my friends are getting"
"4887010","4892870"," wrecked, my friends on Twitter are getting wrecked, I don't want people getting wrecked out there,"
"4892970","4895790"," so I hate the fucking banks."
"4896470","4899130"," I like retail, I like retail bears and retail bulls. "
"4906020","4909500"," I'm not down with the snark in the social media world."
"4910780","4913760"," I'm more for everybody making money and taking money from the banks."
"4917970","4921730"," So yeah, if you're going to take a short here, you're just going to be looking for higher prices. "
"4922310","4925850"," I think we trade higher, I think we trade higher into Wednesday."
"4930970","4936370"," We're set up just means that we trade higher and we're looking for a better entry to take short"
"4936370","4937030"," once again."
"4938510","4939670"," Just keep that in mind. "
"4939970","4940670"," Where do you take short?"
"4941330","4947090"," I think logically, look at a month chart on the spy right now and look at where you should take."
"4947370","4952450"," If you were to look the last three times to take short on the spy, it was what?"
"4952730","4959370"," Back on the second, it was back on the ninth and it was back on this on the high on"
"4959370","4960470"," the 16th."
"4960730","4963770"," So you were not supposed to take short on the fourth. "
"4964350","4969290"," You were not supposed to take short on the 14th and more than likely you're not supposed to take"
"4969290","4971650"," short on the open this morning on the 22nd."
"4975400","4982960"," Yeah, you know, my aside, just ordered another computer to do a live streaming discord."
"4983220","4984840"," I could possibly record that one. "
"4985420","4989040"," A separate recording for educational moments."
"4992220","4998060"," This new setup should allow us to do, I'm going to put another microphone up here, but I've got a"
"4998060","4998980"," second mic."
"4999320","5008850"," So I'll add a second microphone to the recording and I'll make separate videos"
"5008850","5010150"," off of the live stream. "
"5014290","5015610"," How's everybody doing out there this morning?"
"5021300","5025200"," Yeah, so on Friday, I talked about when we're at the bottom on Friday, right?"
"5025400","5029640"," I said to you, I said, if you really wanted to, you should be buying call spreads right now."
"5030180","5033680"," I said, if you're a bear, you should be buying some call spreads in the money right now."
"5033920","5034620"," And those are printing. "
"5035200","5037740"," And it's been four days or five days, right?"
"5037860","5043560"," Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, two days Tuesday, five days later."
"5043860","5049580"," It's no first star link, the internet access name, private company from Elon Musk, they received"
"5049580","5052080"," their first Africa license in Mozambique."
"5052680","5055160"," Your call spreads are printing right now, right?"
"5057260","5060790"," We talked about spreads. "
"5061390","5066850"," Talked about when you buy call spreads in the lows, if I put spreads in the highs, you roll into"
"5066850","5069650"," more aggressive positions depending where we are on the market."
"5080790","5082450"," Most of these things work out."
"5082590","5087570"," If you guys go back in my videos, you'll see that most of these trades, generally speaking, they"
"5087570","5088290"," work out quite well. "
"5091400","5097340"," And yeah, we should do a $100 challenge for spread so you can learn how to make consistent money,"
"5097340","5103620"," just based on probability of the market going up and down, even if the direction is overall down or"
"5103620","5107920"," the direction is overall up, you'll get prints on these things."
"5108160","5113100"," Sometimes you'll see some guys I trade with here, we'll have phone conversations, we get really"
"5113100","5115880"," scared because you're like, oh shit, it's not going down."
"5117300","5121640"," But spreads eventually, if it does eventually go down or up, they will eventually print. "
"5125980","5127280"," That's a good question, Declan."
"5133410","5138110"," Yeah, I've been saying the futures channels since open, I'm looking for the 4.37.5 level at some"
"5138110","5138290"," point."
"5138470","5145130"," Yeah, and you can see right now, we're looking for 43.60. How's everybody doing today?"
"5145290","5146270"," What are you guys all doing well today?"
"5147770","5150230"," So that was a sweet, so that's a sweet play over the weekend, right?"
"5150830","5158170"," If you were just a cash market trader and you only hold calls or puts, and the question on Friday"
"5158170","5163690"," was, well, what happens to anyone that's long or short, long puts or calls over the weekend, and my"
"5163690","5166170"," point over Friday was probably going to get fucked. "
"5167710","5174930"," At the best trade over the weekend would probably be some form of a spread, something that the"
"5174930","5177330"," gang's not going to come take all your money away from you."
"5177990","5183230"," We're probably at some point, I think we traded as low as 430 at some point or 4.31 or"
"5183230","5186050"," some on Friday, and it was like, oh, do I think we'll see?"
"5186270","5187110"," That's the question, right?"
"5187230","5187610"," Direction."
"5187910","5190870"," Do I think we're going to see 430 at some point next week?"
"5191250","5191670"," Probably. "
"5192250","5197890"," Can I get three days of the market just being closed and make money off that with a spread?"
"5198310","5198690"," Probably."
"5200050","5204090"," Do I think that I then we even talked about, do you just take a butterfly?"
"5204450","5205550"," Like on a Friday and on a Friday?"
"5205990","5209330"," Do you think we're going to trade below 420 between now and next Friday?"
"5209330","5209950"," Probably not."
"5210230","5214150"," I think we're going to trade above 440 next week at 4.31?"
"5214430","5214970"," Probably not. "
"5215130","5220330"," You can probably take a spread or a spread of some kind, probably take some kind of a butterfly and"
"5220330","5226650"," probably it's going to print if your cash market between Friday and Monday."
"5231570","5235390"," Hell yeah, I know naked puts and calls didn't print today."
"5235730","5236930"," I fucking know they didn't. "
"5237530","5240230"," I know they didn't print today."
"5242800","5245280"," And it's a pretty consistent way for you to make money."
"5245840","5249760"," So like if you're if you are buying zero dates or buying weeklies or monthlies on the short and"
"5249760","5251840"," long side, there's a lot more risk there. "
"5252220","5255260"," And if you're just saying, hey, where are we in the market?"
"5255340","5256340"," I just need a direction."
"5256940","5259500"," I don't care about the intrinsic value of options."
"5260100","5265660"," I don't want to get burned on the erratic behavior the markets do to high frequency trading. "
"5267120","5268880"," I know the general direction that we're headed."
"5270140","5273140"," I know the date by that date where it's probably going to be."
"5274880","5277280"," You're kind of reducing a whole bunch of problems. "
"5277360","5281140"," I think that the calls I showed you on Friday were 100% print."
"5281760","5284400"," I think they were 100% print that I showed on Friday."
"5284780","5288320"," They printed 100% to be bottomed down at that low on Friday. "
"5288600","5291940"," You make it 100%, no worries, no panic."
"5293140","5297140"," And you know that even if we hit 420, we're going to swing higher at some point into this week."
"5297180","5298020"," And we already have. "
"5306070","5308430"," Yeah, futures market traders make making bank."
"5311380","5311940"," Yeah, I did."
"5312180","5313100"," Stephen, I didn't have a chat. "
"5313260","5314800"," Someone asked me that on Twitter this weekend."
"5314800","5316580"," I didn't want to go into the complexity of that."
"5317420","5318880"," Twitter wasn't rather the right place. "
"5319100","5319400"," Talk about that."
"5319500","5320800"," It's a good time here to talk about that."
"5320980","5326400"," So when you go over a three day weekend and you've got an expiry, the question becomes, do more"
"5326400","5327580"," people want them to?"
"5328140","5330480"," It's not only where are we?"
"5331240","5336620"," So even this morning, if we were down at, let's say we're down at 430 or ref the bell. "
"5336780","5338580"," Let's have the bell at 430 or 425."
"5339920","5345380"," The next question becomes, when we open, is there an implication that we could trade lower?"
"5346060","5348800"," And the market makers already know that we're not trading lower."
"5349080","5350720"," So they're going to say, nope, nobody's going to want these. "
"5351100","5352260"," They're on an expiration date."
"5352720","5354600"," You've already burned down the theta for three days."
"5355400","5359980"," Oftentimes in three weekends, you'll see, unless we're going to head down deeper or higher at that"
"5359980","5364680"," point, you're not going to see, you'll see them rug pull. "
"5366580","5371000"," Even just where they should print, you'll see the rug pull right on the bell."
"5371180","5372080"," You won't even get the money."
"5372260","5373320"," They just won't give it to you. "
"5374020","5376220"," And it's kind of a complex thing to talk about."
"5376420","5381360"," But if it was, if it was an implication, then we would go lower off the bell this morning."
"5382020","5384500"," They would have, they would have put the money into them. "
"5384960","5387140"," But they already pre know that we're not going down at that point."
"5388800","5390180"," Say straight, just rug pull them."
"5391040","5394160"," You don't even get the the five minutes or the 15 minutes to get your money. "
"5402320","5407820"," So we'll look here and see, looks like the some of that resistance is moving slight."
"5408080","5408740"," No, they're still there."
"5409460","5410720"," 435 93. "
"5412400","5413520"," We'll look higher from here."
"5416540","5418100"," I do think they have burnt options today."
"5418200","5423880"," I think we got to move higher between today and Wednesday into the bell or at some point later in"
"5423880","5426520"," the day, maybe midday, and then we'll see a move lower. "
"5432220","5433080"," You won instead."
"5433500","5434140"," Nice, Josh."
"5440700","5445660"," You guys want to know what would happen to puts on our sex, if sanctions are applied against"
"5445660","5447680"," investing trading with Russian businesses?"
"5448360","5448760"," I don't know. "
"5448840","5450440"," I think that trade was over the weekend, bro."
"5451320","5452840"," I don't like the trade even now."
"5452960","5454180"," I liked the trade over the weekend. "
"5454300","5457620"," I was looking at the, uh, uh, the our sex over the weekend."
"5458380","5459640"," And it's the ruble too."
"5459780","5461640"," Didn't the rule recover it over the weekend as well?"
"5464290","5465150"," Yeah, they generally do. "
"5465250","5466310"," They generally screw up snap options."
"5467130","5476350"," Um, I think that the trade, and that's another thing too about sanctions on Russia."
"5483650","5486230"," Well, we'll get the sands question in just a moment. "
"5486850","5492630"," But yes, there is options, profit, calculator, sand does a good job of it."
"5492630","5495150"," And tasty does a great job of that as well."
"5495410","5495710"," Tasty works. "
"5495870","5496370"," That's for you, sand."
"5496850","5499030"," And then who is asking moat?"
"5499150","5501050"," So Carl was asking about the Russian ETF."
"5501050","5509330"," Either Russian ETF is a weird one for all the fluff and pop and circumstance this past weekend. "
"5510710","5517950"," If you guys paid attention real closely, what was being said, does he get some spy puts coming in"
"5517950","5519410"," some bear stepping in currently?"
"5520070","5520910"," Early bears"
"5520910","5530210"," coming"
"5530210","5531250"," in in some dollars."
"5532130","5536930"," If you paid attention real closely, what was said, the real verbage that was said over the weekend,"
"5538590","5545010"," the only sanctions are coming against businesses doing business in those two break off."
"5545550","5552670"," Uh, I don't know what they're going to be called right break off nations, I guess, or states, maybe"
"5552670","5559550"," only companies doing business and people doing business in those in those two regions. "
"5560150","5566390"," You're not seeing a full out, we're going to stop Russia from doing business in the world."
"5567170","5568630"," And I think that includes gas."
"5569270","5570290"," I think it includes wheat. "
"5570670","5572190"," I think, you know, it's really funny."
"5572710","5575030"," Oh, these are rich, very rich, very powerful people."
"5575330","5579250"," I don't think you're going to get the sanctions that you think you're going to see or that I wish"
"5579250","5580010"," that we would see. "
"5580290","5584030"," I think I think you're going to see pop and circumstance."
"5584750","5590890"," And I don't think that you see true sanctions against Russia for what they've taken so far."
"5591650","5596350"," And I was watching a video video this weekend and someone was talking about the situation in"
"5596350","5598010"," Ukraine seem like annuity is talking about. "
"5598230","5600190"," I'll try to find that video and put it up for you guys."
"5600650","5605870"," And his point was that, um, he's not like an ex a military intel guy."
"5606030","5612670"," And his point was that they'll take these two regions, they will leave their forces there and"
"5612670","5616610"," they'll slowly over time just absorb what they want in Ukraine. "
"5617230","5626310"," And as the news passes by as time passes, you'll you'll see you'll see"
"5626310","5631350"," just an absorption and you won't see the US react so heavily."
"5631350","5632970"," It's kind of like a child, right?"
"5634750","5638650"," They just take a little bit of time a little bit more and a little bit more and they worry"
"5638650","5639450"," about over the years."
"5639530","5642830"," You always notice like the last child you allowed them to do whatever the fuck they want to do out"
"5642830","5647690"," there, like you last kid or your sister siblings, like the youngest sibling gets away with whatever"
"5647690","5648110"," they want. "
"5649130","5650450"," And so I think that's the plan."
"5650950","5657290"," Now his only other comment on that was that unless Ukraine were to strike back, unless Ukraine"
"5658610","5665330"," starts a war and an offensive war against Russia, you would then maybe see some sanctions or"
"5665330","5673870"," intervention by NATO, UN, European countries, probably not NATO, but you probably see EU or some"
"5673870","5679730"," nation states step in and maybe they have maybe they have some, I don't, I'm not clear on this if"
"5679730","5682550"," they've got any treaties with neighboring nations."
"5683390","5693290"," But unless you see something like that, Russia will play its cards to not be sanctioned outside"
"5693290","5702550"," of what appeases small people like us, like like Joe Main Street that's watching Fox News or CNN. "
"5703510","5708510"," I think the reality is in the background that Russia is not going to get sanctioned like we think"
"5708510","5715490"," that they are, that the spice will flow still, which is, you know, sad to say, but more than likely"
"5715490","5716310"," will happen."
"5719390","5722070"," So RSX, the trade was over the weekend for right now."
"5722530","5730390"," If you wanted to short RSX, I wouldn't be looking for sanctions against the companies trading with"
"5730390","5735750"," Russian businesses I'd be looking for an attack from Ukraine against Russia. "
"5737610","5746270"," I'd be looking for Russia to be more aggressive and not protect their invasion."
"5747550","5753010"," But if it becomes a protracted invasion, I would think that the Russia trade, the RSX trade is over"
"5753010","5753430"," for now."
"5765010","5770100"," Yeah, I don't think, yeah, slow erosion. "
"5773450","5783210"," Yeah, I don't think"
"5783210","5783470"," right."
"5783670","5792170"," So you're just looking for some some time around March 18, and I can see below support forming up"
"5792170","5798430"," again at 430 trading a trading area above here to 435 84 currently."
"5800210","5803810"," We have the up down below at 433 28. "
"5806030","5807710"," So we'll pay attention to the news."
"5807970","5809770"," Well, you can take shorts on RSX."
"5809970","5816510"," If you're looking to take a short on RSX, your key thing your key thing that you're looking for is"
"5816510","5824950"," you're listening to another great trade over the weekend was just now President Biden is set to"
"5824950","5828570"," give further remarks about Russia and the Ukraine at 2 p.m. Eastern time today. "
"5829050","5829310"," Ding."
"5833300","5840440"," So you're looking for if you're in a short the Russia and its Russian ETF or the what's the gas"
"5840440","5844580"," visit is it perm gas or something prom gas."
"5845100","5846400"," It's called prom gas. "
"5846600","5847900"," I posted that on Twitter this weekend."
"5848540","5854260"," Do you want to take shorts on those or take shorts on the ruble the ruble versus the US dollar,"
"5854480","5856820"," not the dollar versus the US other the ruble."
"5857120","5863740"," You want to give them time for time to recover and then you want to short them with two targets"
"5863740","5864180"," in mind. "
"5864620","5869080"," You're looking for news that happens outside of market orders actually in market hours."
"5869460","5874140"," I'm looking for here news that happens outside of market hours or you're looking for some kind of a"
"5874140","5879520"," more aggressiveness, not a protection that Russia I think in Russia is doing that."
"5879640","5882540"," They're going to try to protect this over time. "
"5884740","5893660"," Apple Apple puts March 4 165 p $220,000 $216,000 $223,000."
"5894100","5903440"," That's all on March 4 165 p and 162.5 p spy puts every 22nd 430 p"
"5903440","5905020"," $55,000."
"5911110","5920460"," Gaz from t-chrome knows that it is it's gaz from Josh as his short Macy's pumping on earnings. "
"5922300","5924260"," Is the RSX a dip to buy though?"
"5924500","5926360"," No, it's probably a dip to sell at some point."
"5931330","5934150"," And just know we continue to do the following."
"5935030","5942750"," The Russia earlier, we saw reports that the Duma was going to be convene, we're now seeing a report"
"5942750","5947830"," that the Russian Senate is set to vote on potentially sending troops outside of Russia. "
"5950210","5957630"," This is after the governing party did vote to recognize the Hans and Dinesque as separate"
"5957630","5958330"," territories."
"5958870","5958970"," Yes."
"5962530","5965250"," This is setting up for some nice volatility in the market currently. "
"5965250","5971270"," We've got Biden coming up to speak at 2 p.m. We're getting the Russian Senate voting to send troops"
"5972050","5978070"," outside of Russian territory into the Ukraine breakaway province or regions."
"5981480","5982740"," I read this to you right now."
"5982820","5984740"," This is related to RSX the ETF. "
"5984940","5986080"," So keep your eye on it currently."
"5987300","5989640"," So look at RSX out there."
"5989720","5991560"," If you are trading it, you want to take a look at that. "
"5992180","5999340"," They're related at tickers are the USD to rule the USD to the U.A.H. and RSX."
"6001730","6003310"," Funny we're just talking about that, right?"
"6003990","6006310"," I'm going to look at RSX right now, by the way."
"6033040","6043280"," RSX now falling off from its recovery at this point on that news that was just released at"
"6043280","6043700"," the Senate. "
"6043980","6052140"," Russian Senate had voted to deploy troops across borders from Russia into Ukraine."
"6067790","6068710"," Yeah, I didn't get a chance."
"6068870","6070170"," I should have listened to Kamala speak. "
"6070350","6072510"," I didn't get to hear her speech."
"6079030","6080230"," Yeah, I agree with that, Desperado."
"6082390","6087490"," Police spoke with saying that Joe Biden's speech was the last of the unknowns for the day. "
"6087570","6089450"," Unless Kamala talks, she's not a really bad other day."
"6089530","6090330"," I didn't hear her speak."
"6090570","6093330"," I heard some of the talk about her speaking, but I didn't pay attention. "
"6093510","6093810"," I should have."
"6099790","6101330"," Yeah, decline is making a good point."
"6101390","6102730"," It's truly to start drilling to the core. "
"6103050","6104290"," I still agree with that."
"6106940","6108840"," I think you get a pump from Joe Biden today."
"6109900","6116660"," I think my next short position is somewhere between 436 and 440. "
"6122050","6125090"," Yes, saying go chart has been wonderful for the MES today."
"6126950","6129090"," Germany cut off the pipeline this morning."
"6129250","6129790"," I didn't know that. "
"6134090","6135330"," I didn't see that news yet."
"6136490","6140550"," I think maybe I saw something about Germany this morning, but I didn't see that they cut off the"
"6140550","6140790"," pipeline."
"6141350","6144290"," So I'm going to comment yesterday too, saying what if they blow up the pipeline?"
"6145650","6152590"," And then there were some more pipelines, something about gas production in the U.S. being allowed. "
"6153590","6158970"," Apple calls June 16th, 195 C, $1.3 million."
"6160590","6163550"," Another bid coming into RSX right now."
"6165580","6175020"," A reversal candle on"
"6175020","6189890"," the spy currently, and also watching some really"
"6189890","6190390"," weird here. "
"6190570","6197500"," I'm looking at a little bit of a settling down here of the VIX."
"6197640","6200600"," So that's settling down, but some basing on the VIX here."
"6201260","6208780"," A reversal candle on the VIX, a basing pattern. "
"6214860","6217220"," So they denied the certification of the new pipeline."
"6217680","6220860"," If they blow up the other percentage needs, they would say they're crazy."
"6222100","6227800"," Well, no, someone was saying yesterday, someone was saying yesterday that on Twitter that Ukraine"
"6227800","6234100"," could start blowing some of the pipes that are running through its nation, its data. "
"6234860","6236960"," I think Gung show is over."
"6239700","6244880"," Maybe I should bring up some Twitter news as well right now and see if anything pops up."
"6252530","6257910"," So yeah, we know about the assumption is that the Biden speech is going to be positive. "
"6258550","6261150"," At this point, I think it's going to be positive."
"6261550","6271330"," It was taken positive the last time, the last time that Russia did"
"6271330","6271810"," something."
"6279530","6281050"," Oh, shit. "
"6281510","6283010"," I'm looking at Walter Bloomberg real quick."
"6290500","6300490"," Walter Bloomberg's got like a ton, a ton of, am I not"
"6300490","6301970"," following Walter Bloomberg anymore?"
"6305470","6306610"," We see here."
"6308530","6312030"," There's so many, there's so many bots that are at Walter Bloomberg out there. "
"6312130","6312990"," It's not even funny."
"6315270","6326100"," Hold on."
"6330220","6333960"," Oh, I thought I was following the real Walter Bloomberg here. "
"6333960","6334940"," I got to look for him."
"6336920","6338100"," Give me a second here."
"6341300","6342560"," Maybe he banned me. "
"6345260","6347660"," I'm following one of my private accounts here."
"6350320","6351920"," Give me just a second here."
"6353400","6354200"," Here we go. "
"6354360","6354840"," Delta one."
"6363880","6364960"," Let me see what he's saying."
"6365120","6369760"," Russian Depends, Abraham has promised to prove the Russian troops and don't mess that past, by the"
"6369760","6372580"," way, or it looks like it passed. "
"6373800","6376220"," Oh, they've so they've reconvened."
"6376280","6377660"," I made a mistake there."
"6378000","6386860"," Russian Upper House of Parliament has reconvened to vote on the to vote on the Putin request"
"6386860","6387800"," authorizing troops. "
"6387840","6389620"," They haven't located yet."
"6389740","6390240"," I got that wrong."
"6395560","6398100"," So we do have some volatility now in the market. "
"6399740","6401420"," We've got a two o'clock."
"6402000","6410350"," We've got a two o'clock speech by Biden."
"6412170","6421940"," We've got Russia authorizing the authorizing their troops, possibly to"
"6421940","6422440"," enter. "
"6424600","6425380"," I don't know."
"6425500","6427480"," I mean, I don't know if we consider Ukraine right now."
"6428420","6430460"," They're claiming that it's their territory now, right?"
"6438110","6443410"," So maybe I guess that depends on how you look at that. "
"6443550","6449690"," They shouldn't need to authorize entering the Ukraine regions if they're claiming them as their own"
"6449690","6450250"," at this point."
"6451070","6451930"," So that's kind of odd."
"6454570","6460790"," Reversal candle on the spy on the I think that was the 15 minute of the five minute. "
"6464250","6471510"," We've had two rejections above at 435 20 and 435 60 hoping that we could get to 436."
"6484770","6486590"," And the bears are stepping in."
"6488050","6489570"," They want to see us trade down. "
"6489570","6493950"," They want to see us trade down to 427 33 or so."
"6496730","6498030"," Yeah, I don't want to trade this."
"6498310","6499850"," I don't like trading this sideways shit. "
"6500470","6501770"," I don't want anything to do with it."
"6504650","6506290"," Oh, no, I didn't get to put my pan hammer."
"6506410","6506870"," He's still there. "
"6507110","6511570"," He's in my he's in my I was still friends with him."
"6512070","6513230"," We're still homies."
"6514450","6515630"," Did you guys see that?"
"6515870","6522430"," Do you guys see that those texts from from rich from rich on Twitter yesterday?"
"6523070","6529770"," And you see zero not zero hedge, but one of the other guys like Walter Bloomberg's typed in limit"
"6529770","6531150"," down yesterday. "
"6531370","6531890"," It was hilarious."
"6533810","6536890"," The ship posting was at the FX hedge."
"6537290","6538750"," It was FX hedge yesterday. "
"6540630","6544330"," They posted a post yesterday, middle of the afternoon said limit down."
"6544950","6549290"," People are getting wild on social media yesterday."
"6552180","6553740"," Straight wild over the weekend. "
"6554540","6559520"," I mean, pretty much, pretty much the futures market over the weekend got abused."
"6561460","6563160"," It was, I don't know what to say."
"6563360","6568420"," I thought, yeah, I like Jenny Marcus yesterday said something like I was going to do my taxes and"
"6568420","6572940"," then I got strapped into, uh, I got strapped into Twitter today and I did the same thing. "
"6572940","6574400"," I was like, Oh, I got all sorts of stuff to do."
"6574720","6576740"," And then I'm telling my family, I'm like, you know what?"
"6576820","6579540"," I can't do anything because I don't know what's going to happen today."
"6580160","6583180"," Because it seemed like it was a big operation, a big scam. "
"6583180","6589850"," Like yesterday, the whole weekend, to me was what was a way to make money."
"6590250","6592330"," I think a money, make an operation over the weekend."
"6593650","6597690"," It's funny too, because they turned on CNBC this morning just to get their take. "
"6598330","6600430"," And they acted like nothing happened over the weekend."
"6600430","6603610"," They were like, we're not going to discuss what happened in futures over the weekend."
"6604430","6608970"," And futures was just pretty much like a just a big scam, not a scam. "
"6609190","6611970"," It's like, uh, you know, we're going to make a bunch of money over the weekend and then we'll come"
"6611970","6612190"," back."
"6612870","6615290"," And it's like the, it's like the parents are gone on Friday."
"6615590","6622170"," Parents go away in vacation and the kids have a fucking rager over the weekend. "
"6622850","6626010"," And then the parents show up on Monday morning or Sunday night."
"6626430","6632710"," And you like, there's like, the penis is broken on the, on the statue like in goonies or, you know,"
"6632810","6637470"," the pictures hang in sideways in the living room and they let, they bring the market right back to"
"6637470","6640270"," where it was from Friday on Tuesday morning."
"6641370","6644230"," So I just thought that was hilarious over this past weekend. "
"6644990","6648110"," Uh, you know, of course, the, the ship posting was at all time highs over the weekend."
"6648610","6654930"," Well, watching some spy calls come in February 25th, 442C, a couple hundred thousand dollars, some"
"6654930","6661130"," puts on our why, uh, April 14th, 105P, 400,000."
"6663030","6666750"," Spy calls every 25th, 440C, 140,000 dollars. "
"6668070","6671070"," It was like we're playing where we're trading inside of this range, right?"
"6671710","6672430"," 430 to 436."
"6679960","6681320"," It was insane over the weekend."
"6682720","6688260"," And then, and then the worst part is you don't know who's drinking the Kool-Aid and who's not. "
"6689380","6693480"," You don't know who realizes that it's only for the weekend."
"6694320","6697240"," I'm assuming that some people out there were like, we're burning this bitch down."
"6697380","6698920"," We're going to 400 bytes by Monday. "
"6700720","6702240"," You know, of course we're not."
"6702500","6703880"," So we didn't."
"6710540","6714700"," Spy calls February 22, 432C, 113,000 dollars. "
"6715040","6719560"," Nike calls high out of the score, March 18th, 150C, 120,000 dollars."
"6720100","6723520"," Arcade puts March 4th, 60P, 80,000 dollars."
"6724040","6730040"," QQQ's, February 28th, 340C, 376,000 dollars. "
"6730600","6740480"," Probably a trade off of maybe the Biden speech being, uh, being positive or, or taken"
"6740480","6741260"," as positive."
"6744640","6746460"," We'll see if there's another buy in for the spy."
"6746640","6750020"," Maybe there's a buy at 431, 17 or so. "
"6750900","6753980"," We'll look down below and see if there is a little closer."
"6755520","6756360"," Let's see right here."
"6757140","6759120"," Right down here, some buyers are waiting to buy. "
"6762410","6768110"," I don't know if he get as low as this 431, 10, but buyers are hoping that it comes down"
"6768110","6768730"," here real quick."
"6782250","6786590"," And just a word of caution that the VIX does look bullish right now."
"6786910","6788430"," Looks like we can sell down from here. "
"6789010","6792050"," Even if the buyer is waiting down below, uh, it does."
"6792510","6794530"," The VIX is telling a different story."
"6802760","6803540"," Someone breaks. "
"6803680","6805060"," Greetings to the mom's Elvis statue."
"6805500","6806320"," Oh, fuck yeah."
"6806680","6808120"," I haven't ever thought about that showing forever. "
"6810810","6812530"," Not coming back to the office until he is."
"6812650","6813150"," Is it zero?"
"6813890","6821680"," Yeah, there was one thing to be said."
"6821900","6823060"," We were talking about this yesterday. "
"6823500","6830640"," Uh, it's talking to Joe on the phone yesterday and there was one change yesterday and that speech"
"6830640","6836900"," from, I watched that speech from from, um, I watched, you know, I used to never list, I used to"
"6836900","6841000"," only consume whatever Putin said, uh, that the news told us."
"6841940","6848080"," And then I watched his speech on gas back in, uh, uh, should I want to say December?"
"6849680","6854860"," December, I did a big speech, uh, to the, to the, uh, I don't know who to was, but one"
"6854860","6856260"," of these European rackets, right?"
"6856440","6857700"," These energy rackets."
"6858040","6868760"," And it was wild to actually listen to the entire speech spy April"
"6868760","6872140"," 14, 457c, 1.9 million dollars. "
"6873460","6877640"," It was wild to listen to him speed up, give him full speech because he gets erratic and he gets"
"6877640","6877920"," crazy."
"6877920","6880100"," I mean, his speeches are fucking wild."
"6880980","6885860"," Uh, if you go back and listen to some of them, yeah, he gave one to like an energy council,"
"6886100","6890420"," whatever European energy conglomerate speech and he told them to go fuck themselves. "
"6891160","6897920"," He said, basically, basically, he said, I sell energy to Europe and then there are consortiums"
"6897920","6901140"," within Europe that fuck you, uh, it's not me."
"6901420","6903720"," It's your consortiums that are, they're fucking you."
"6904040","6904920"," It's not my problem. "
"6905680","6911040"," And, of course, energy prices were heading up at that time and they continued to rise, as you know,"
"6911160","6911920"," from then until now."
"6913000","6919680"," But his speech that he gave over the weekend was dragging in more nations."
"6922520","6931200"," Uh, there's some danger there because there's a thought that, uh, you know, he's harking back"
"6931200","6933860"," towards not, he said communism was bad. "
"6934100","6941360"," He's harking back towards, uh, a time when Russia, 35 billion in eight week bills and 45 billion in"
"6941360","6942140"," four week bills."
"6945000","6953620"," He was harking back to a time when Russia was an empire and, uh, it brings up the question of,"
"6953620","6957860"," is he going to try to take back Eastern Black countries?"
"6958580","6961240"," Uh, to create a buffer."
"6961640","6966500"," I'm not, you know, I'm not, as a part of me that remembers the Cold War and there's a lot"
"6966500","6971680"," of horrible things about the Cold War, but there was more stability in some respects, uh, with,"
"6972080","6974660"," with a, um, with Eastern Black countries. "
"6974940","6978860"," Matter of fact, there was more stability in, uh, it's weird."
"6979560","6981460"," You're like Bosnia, Syria, right?"
"6981780","6985640"," Uh, I was in the army then for, I was young, really young, I was 17 years old when Bosnia"
"6985640","6991260"," and Serbia was going on and, uh, they're watching some, uh, Qs calls February 28th, 340 C, five"
"6991260","6997980"," hundred and sixty five thousand dollars and video puts, uh, March 4th, 237.5 P for three hundred"
"6997980","6998880"," and fifty five thousand dollars."
"6999140","7006900"," IWM puts March 11th, 195 P two sets sweeps for three hundred thousand dollars each. "
"7007580","7010900"," Uh, but so when I was in back then, right, what's interesting is you had that the iron, the iron"
"7010900","7017980"," hand or iron thumb of Russia on these countries and these countries have had blood feuds for"
"7017980","7018820"," millennial, right?"
"7019260","7021920"," Uh, especially like Muslim nations, right?"
"7022120","7026620"," You've got blood feuds have gone back generation over generation over generation over generation"
"7026620","7028220"," and a quieting of that to an extent."
"7028620","7032660"," But the moment when Russia pulled back, people pulled out their little black books and said, hey, I"
"7032660","7034980"," remember you fucking me over, right?"
"7035180","7037000"," I remember you fucking me over when Russia was in charge."
"7037440","7041740"," I remember your grandfather and your great-grandfather and I'm coming back to get you now, right?"
"7042460","7048980"," And reportedly Gazprom today is not booking extra day ahead, UK, Ukraine, transit capacity. "
"7053110","7054930"," Ooh, Gazprom just talked about that."
"7055330","7060290"," And so you've got, uh, so when, when Russia pulled back from all these nations, you saw lots of"
"7060290","7060650"," infighting."
"7061250","7067960"," Uh, you saw, uh, civil war is basically in some of countries and you've seen it in Afghanistan. "
"7068020","7071740"," You've seen it, uh, Bosnia, uh, places like that."
"7071840","7076800"," And you saw some of that, even in Ukraine, you saw, uh, Ukraine was at one time was the tip"
"7076800","7078220"," of the spear for Russia to Europe."
"7078580","7081060"," It's where Russia had the largest buildup of forces. "
"7081400","7087340"," You had Russians and Ukrainians, uh, uh, uh, hand in hand arms."
"7087340","7089580"," You saw the dissolution of their military."
"7089580","7094780"," They had like a million soldiers in Ukraine and they had the largest stockpile of nukes. "
"7094780","7098360"," They had, um, one of the largest naval fleets that they inherited."
"7098880","7101020"," They also inherited a bunch of arms."
"7101340","7102780"," They had, they had a bunch of stuff, right?"
"7103140","7108460"," And then the Russians ended up leaving and they, uh, they had a breakdown inside of their country"
"7108460","7109380"," to an extent, right?"
"7109500","7115360"," They also had, they rolled into some form of democracy, uh, and they had a problem, the same"
"7115360","7116460"," problem that Russia kind of had. "
"7116780","7125200"," They had corruption, uh, and not in fact, but lots of corruption in their form of democracy, uh,"
"7125620","7128980"," that, that they, that they rolled into same, same kind of a situation with Russia."
"7129440","7139120"," Russia never really, uh, uh, became, uh, wealthy from, uh, the changes that took place, right?"
"7140120","7141200"," Uh, in its nation."
"7141440","7145540"," Same thing kind of happened with Ukraine as well, to an extent. "
"7146360","7152580"," Uh, so I guess the question becomes in that speech that he had, is he trying to have a legacy,"
"7152700","7156100"," trying not to get replaced, trying to get, it's Putin not trying to get knocked off?"
"7156760","7162180"," Is Putin trying to say, well, I'm as great as Lenin, but in my own way, I'm going back"
"7162180","7169660"," to the empire again."
"7170360","7176540"," And so instead of rolling in communism, am I going to roll in that this, you know, this, uh, this,"
"7176680","7179360"," this, like, Nicholas, kind of a czar, kind of a thing, right?"
"7179540","7180300"," It's kind of a bizarro."
"7181900","7187820"," Now we're gonna take back these countries and we're gonna make these, uh, roll these into Russia as"
"7187820","7188440"," another border. "
"7188980","7192700"," So I guess if you were like a Poland, I'd be scared, but I'd be concerned if I was Poland,"
"7193180","7200780"," uh, if I was any of these border nations from that speech, it definitely lends a concern level that"
"7200780","7206100"," we didn't have in them in, in our geopolitical scale before that speech."
"7206700","7210080"," I don't think that was the thought process of Putin."
"7210260","7215900"," But the only thing I would note with that is that, uh, after going back and reading or watching and"
"7215900","7219660"," listening to some of his previous speeches, the guy gives these speeches like this all the time and"
"7219660","7220540"," gives crazy ass speeches. "
"7220540","7227260"," Uh, we're watching Apple puts March 11th, 165 P for two million dollars."
"7227320","7232540"," Thomas from NATO Stoltenberg saying that recent actions in Russia are serious escalation."
"7235890","7239330"," So Apple puts March 11th, 165 P two million dollars. "
"7239510","7247710"," Whoo, Apple just getting, let's take a look at Apple watching lots of Apple puts just stack up."
"7247810","7250850"," I don't know if these are put sellers put buyers on Apple."
"7251150","7252770"," They have an event coming up to right. "
"7255930","7256850"," So we'll check out Apple."
"7259640","7262820"," Yeah, I don't think that he's as real rational as, uh, people are saying he is."
"7263660","7267980"," I think if you go back and listen to a lot of his speeches, uh, he is, yeah, if you're"
"7267980","7276200"," finished, if you're Swedish, if you're, uh, any of the, just to hear, 45 minute hit shows makes me"
"7276200","7277540"," think here's more of what would be cranium. "
"7277540","7281160"," I'd actually go in and attack and he's constantly getting, getting fucked by the US and NATO."
"7283240","7284700"," I'll show you a Tesla on book map next."
"7285340","7288540"," Uh, he has helpless and cornered to an extent. "
"7289380","7295120"," I agree with that statement to Josh and you're seeing, you're seeing in that, that speech that he's"
"7295120","7300520"," kind of admitting to a point that they haven't partaken in the growth that they should have taken,"
"7300520","7301720"," taken apart in."
"7303640","7305460"," Polish and Finnish troops did react to it."
"7305520","7306100"," Yeah, but they did. "
"7308100","7310880"," I didn't think it would talk at all up until yesterday."
"7311560","7314820"," That's where Russia remember to attack after hearing his complaints and his stance."
"7317720","7319940"," Yeah, the, uh, there was definitely some concern. "
"7320560","7323700"," Uh, looks like, uh, at spies looking to roll over slightly here."
"7324480","7325460"," We'll see what happens."
"7325920","7327320"," See how far if it trades down. "
"7328340","7330060"," I haven't taken a position yet in the market."
"7335970","7340430"," These these fucking Tuesdays and Wednesdays after long weekends, this is the norm."
"7343170","7349830"," You trap everybody, you trap all these bulls and bears in, lock them all in, and they're going to"
"7349830","7350890"," fuel the next move up or down. "
"7352850","7353730"," Thank you for playing."
"7355110","7360350"," Yeah, even if, uh, even if Apple doesn't go down right now, just the, just the hedging on this,"
"7360350","7365860"," these trades alone has to knock Apple down."
"7372020","7373800"," It's a lot of negativity about there with Apple. "
"7374140","7375540"," That's the last peg for the market, right?"
"7376140","7377500"," A couple of them sitting out there, right?"
"7377620","7383640"," You got Tesla, Apple, Amazon, Facebook's already been knocked down."
"7387850","7391510"," Heaven looked at all the big, uh, Fang Man names you have to see who's going to knock down the"
"7391510","7392090"," rest of the market."
"7394870","7396290"," Yeah, we'll kick it around at 165. "
"7397370","7398370"," Buyers down below 150."
"7403310","7404030"," See here."
"7404610","7409070"," If Apple goes back to its, uh, pre-2020 stuff, it's somewhere down 140s, right?"
"7409770","7411030"," Can't remember, I'm not my head. "
"7412930","7414390"," Here indicator is slightly negative."
"7417410","7418990"," Where the real buyers aren't Apple."
"7420690","7421630"," Put this load up. "
"7427890","7430110"," Man, you get some real buyers down there, 150."
"7431310","7436690"," 140 would put them, 140 would put them back to pretty much 2020 levels."
"7439330","7441010"," And you get a steepness here, right?"
"7441190","7442170"," 200,000 buyers. "
"7443510","7446630"," 150 is what the hope is that it only trades down to 150."
"7448010","7450190"," 140 would be way out of rent, way out of bounds for them."
"7455880","7459600"," It's hoping for a 10-point move down on Apple. "
"7468030","7470350"," Amazon stalled again, Amazon losing 3K."
"7470550","7473190"," Could be rough on the last generals to really sell off, yeah."
"7480130","7482210"," My puts have been doing the best today. "
"7482510","7484550"," So you're getting some premium kicking your puts, Mary."
"7489540","7490820"," We'll get Tesla next."
"7493940","7495880"," So price started in Apple of 150. "
"7502510","7503510"," We'll check Tesla."
"7525700","7528700"," We'll also look to see if Spy can break through this."
"7530160","7540730"," There's a little bit of a buyers"
"7540730","7542350"," down below it, 436. "
"7545170","7547470"," A little bit of ice down below here at 431."
"7559830","7561850"," Not seeing too much lower from there."
"7563190","7567540"," A little bit of ice in here. "
"7568420","7572360"," At 39,000, 30,000 buyers."
"7572680","7574000"," Real buyers down below 430."
"7580880","7584220"," Same usual trading, same usual trading, right?"
"7585040","7586620"," Trading range as all week. "
"7589420","7590480"," We'll get Tesla."
"7604030","7612610"," Tesla trading down to light support at 823, 820, and buyers down at 800."
"7614110","7614710"," We're going to look lower. "
"7617950","7620710"," See if we're back down to that 75th or not."
"7630790","7632350"," Cuse buyers stepping in."
"7634050","7640070"," February 22nd, 343 C, $40,000 times 2."
"7643430","7644830"," Below 800 and C."
"7654390","7655650"," And this is nice to see. "
"7655850","7659270"," You're seeing, you know, 200,000 buyers right at 800."
"7661070","7663030"," 500,000 buyers at that 750."
"7663670","7667990"," The one that I'm talking about down here, real wall at the real wall, believe it or not, on Tesla"
"7667990","7668570"," is 750. "
"7670830","7672230"," That's a wall right there, okay?"
"7672930","7675190"," You do have substantial buyers though at 800."
"7675590","7678670"," I assume these are, you know, intraday traders, how do I think?"
"7678750","7679570"," Hopefully we get to 800."
"7681410","7683250"," I have to pick it up for a trade higher at 850. "
"7684170","7684890"," Great 30 to 850."
"7688190","7689410"," More sellers than buyers."
"7689750","7692230"," You're just going to want the sea bulls, except that we're going to 750. "
"7699170","7701070"," Guys, I'm going to look at what next."

"7728250","7731790"," March 18, 29C, 400,000 dollars."
"7743470","7745250"," Take a look at Lucid real quick. "
"7747170","7747890"," A little them up."
"7755300","7756280"," A little Lucid."
"7756500","7758820"," We've saw some high-ago score calls coming in. "
"7758920","7762160"," March 18, 29C, 400,000 dollars."
"7762660","7763980"," Let's put four ways."
"7764420","7764740"," All sweeps. "
"7766160","7768120"," We'll look at a bunch of these here in a minute."
"7768180","7768700"," I'll look at Nvidia."
"7769700","7773120"," I'll look at Amazon for you and AMD. "
"7774900","7776620"," I think it hits 754 March."
"7778200","7782020"," I think there's going to be, I think we trade higher in the market."
"7782480","7790560"," I think there's one thing that's the only thing right now, the only thing right now that's abnormal"
"7790560","7791780"," is Russia. "
"7793140","7799360"," We didn't have Russia in this to contend with."
"7799420","7808880"," The only thing with us trading hot, we should trade higher to 450.40 and then trade down to a"
"7808880","7809280"," lower level."
"7810080","7811800"," We should get rejection at 440 at some point. "
"7811940","7815380"," The only wrench in the program right now is, believe it or not, Ukraine and Russia."
"7816660","7818700"," That could wipe out the trade to 440."
"7819400","7820460"," Send us much lower. "
"7822300","7831940"," But technically, technically, we should trade higher to 440 first and get a rejection there."
"7835040","7840280"," We didn't have, or in this, you guys have seen the home, Mr. Blonde."
"7840920","7844760"," We didn't have something like that going on when that was going on last time. "
"7846440","7847240"," And we're not in overs."
"7847420","7849580"," I didn't show you guys that we're not in oversold yet either."
"7849980","7851980"," The RSI is not quite oversold. "
"7852780","7854380"," That would be one more thing in the bear's favor."
"7856480","7859000"," If we retested to 420, we would be oversold."
"7861100","7864940"," This is why we look like this is why we're getting call buyers maybe. "
"7869280","7871100"," Lucid, I wouldn't be buying calls here yet."
"7872440","7886130"," I wouldn't be buying calls until at least the test of 25.14. And"
"7886130","7890610"," even then, the real price target is down below at 20."
"7893130","7894210"," This can easily break. "
"7895090","7896850"," Not that we won't get a bounce here."
"7898330","7899350"," And 25 flat."
"7901070","7904010"," But your real wall on Lucid is 20 bucks currently. "
"7913090","7916830"," No, I don't think it was a trade war."
"7917170","7921330"," It had to do with the trade war, but it also had to do with rates, believe it or not."
"7927150","7930930"," I don't, frankly, I doubt Tesla could even get to below 800. "
"7932350","7933930"," We already got below 800, bro."
"7935350","7936850"," We got below 800 already."
"7937710","7940750"," Jafar, we got below 300, well, in January. "
"7941670","7942390"," It went to 790."
"7945330","7946750"," I don't see spies slipping either."
"7946970","7949030"," I just see us trading off this 430. "
"7953650","7957410"," And if you're in puts, take profit and then reopen them below 430."
"7958050","7958690"," That would be the answer."
"7961390","7966050"," You can take profit and then you reenter puts if we break below 430. "
"7970550","7973330"," Yeah, we already went down below 800 on Tesla."
"7973510","7974570"," So we know we can go below 800."
"7974930","7976250"," We went to 791, I think. "
"7979010","7982310"," So a retest of 791 is on the table, right?"
"7982510","7983330"," At least test there."
"7983830","7987070"," And make sure that we don't want to go lower than 791 or 800."
"7988970","7994270"," If you break below that 800, that retest of Tesla, next price target, 750. "
"7997450","7999110"," I get that you'll want to go to 750."
"7999490","8001110"," I don't think I want to see us go ahead of me."
"8001170","8002770"," I don't want to see us go to 750 on Tesla. "
"8004770","8008910"," But the reality is if the market starts to sell real selling, right?"
"8009150","8009690"," Real money selling."
"8010370","8012350"," These are banks that are really selling."
"8012910","8014230"," They will sell their positions. "
"8014730","8018330"," This isn't us retail saying, you know, I love Tesla and I do."
"8018430","8020090"," I love Tesla all day long."
"8020390","8025190"," It has to do with banks taking profit off the table and risk off the table. "
"8027670","8029590"," So they get a better buy-in, believe it or not."
"8029710","8030810"," They don't care about what we think."
"8031450","8033110"," They don't care about what Elon thinks. "
"8035170","8036450"," They care about their risk profile."
"8036890","8040650"," They care about rebying into bonds first, where they buy into stocks."
"8043370","8045190"," Let's see if we can trade lower here and make it along. "
"8048580","8050400"," If we can see a bounce on 430."
"8052560","8054180"," Might be up along here at some point."
"8064870","8071370"," We've got a large concentration of put buyers still on 430P for today, expiring for today. "
"8071470","8079810"," They're now $4.43. I'm going to watch the flow come in and see if we can see a wall"
"8079810","8087030"," or cascade of puts flow come in and see if we can trade lower than 430 if we can't."
"8087470","8091770"," I'm probably going to grab a long here at some point."
"8093570","8099090"," Probably 4.33s. I don't know how low we go. "
"8099930","8114850"," Maybe 4.32s. I'm"
"8114850","8116170"," going to give it a minute here and just wait and see."
"8125730","8127270"," Let's see anything else in here."
"8130760","8136900"," European macro, the NATO Secretary General Stolberg, Russian actions are a serious escalation. "
"8137920","8143880"," Every indication is that Russia is planning a full attack that came out at 10.44, or excuse me,"
"8143940","8147860"," that came out at 11.08. That's what 12 minutes ago."
"8152480","8160240"," Watching Tesla puts come in February 25th, 8.30P for $667,000."
"8173200","8178520"," I agree with Jafar's points, right?"
"8180630","8182790"," It's not that I don't agree with Jafar's points. "
"8183050","8184350"," I agree with Jafar's points."
"8184630","8189950"," It's a question of, so if you guys have to look at, like, so last week when I talked to"
"8189950","8195290"," you guys about real money selling, it will expand upon this right now."
"8199250","8203730"," We have an options-driven market, okay?"
"8206129","8210209"," Right now, the options that are driving the market are puts, not calls. "
"8211790","8218889"," Now, even outside of that, let's say we're taking profit on these puts, we're not seeing the call"
"8218889","8220870"," expansion that we're looking for, right?"
"8220870","8226910"," But there's another problem in the market right now, and that is real money selling."
"8227629","8237469"," It's called real money selling, and it doesn't matter if we have puts being closed, call"
"8237469","8238110"," expansion."
"8241450","8248570"," There's real money selling in this market right now, so you've got equity selling not being driven"
"8248570","8250690"," by option flow. "
"8251209","8258629"," So you've got real large banks that are selling their positions in these tickers due to risk in the"
"8258629","8266469"," market, and so regardless of where the options are, the markets are moving down based upon"
"8266469","8269709"," just real money selling."
"8269709","8277030"," You've got people with positions that are exiting these equity positions in the market, and it is"
"8277030","8283850"," forcing the market down regardless of options flow, regardless of put flow, call flow, anything out"
"8283850","8284070"," there."
"8284790","8293469"," And when you look at a company like Tesla or Apple or it doesn't matter what the ticker is, it"
"8293469","8297930"," doesn't matter how good the fundamentals are, if you look at them over the course of five years, 10"
"8297930","8306430"," years, you will see, even though things are good, you'll see those tickers trade down, and so"
"8306430","8308030"," that's a combination of a few things. "
"8308330","8315510"," First it is just banks taking profit, banks saying, hey, I bought Apple at 550 last summer, I"
"8315510","8321570"," bought in, I was the big bank that bought that ticker at 550, and I wrote it up to 1200,"
"8322129","8327750"," and I've slowly been scaling out of my position, trying to take my money out, my profit out at"
"8327750","8332709"," different levels, we traded higher, they're going to take more money out, and then you've got now"
"8332709","8337930"," risk in the market, and so I'm going to take the last of my money out of this trade, and"
"8337930","8344190"," that doesn't mean we trade down to 550 again, but it does usually, over time that you'll see us"
"8344190","8351190"," trade back and give back on some of those gains, so if you are a long Tesla investor, the time"
"8351190","8358910"," to buy Tesla was this summer at 550, if you were, so the last time to buy Tesla was this"
"8358910","8363330"," summer at 550, that's when you want to take long in Tesla, there's a bunch of guys, and you got"
"8363330","8371549"," like Justin, you've got Tesla Wolf, you've got Joe Donut, a whole bunch of us, we took Tesla long,"
"8371790","8377150"," all summer long, right, started back in May, I think, and so when you see it trading back now to"
"8377150","8383709"," 800, it's not really that low of a number if you took it from 550 this summer, so you're like,"
"8383770","8386190"," well, where does it trade back to for the next run higher?"
"8387150","8393450"," And I want to take it at 800, but the reality is, for where we are in the market right"
"8393450","8399850"," now, there's a fair chance though we get back to 750, now I could miss that trade, let's say I"
"8399850","8404850"," missed that trade at 750, and let's say it trades from 800 and higher from here, we don't get any"
"8404850","8410110"," lower in Tesla, we trade higher, for me personally, I'm going to have to then go back and look at"
"8410110","8416790"," how I research these tickers and say, well, where did I make a mistake in targeting 750, right, and"
"8416790","8424610"," catch the next dip and try to adjust my buy-in strategies for my favorite tickers, so for me on"
"8424610","8431450"," Tesla, I don't look at it from a perspective of I technically think Tesla can trade down to 750, I"
"8431450","8436570"," think technically Tesla trades to 800, but then I look at inside that trading range, and you guys"
"8436570","8443230"," see me, you see here, you guys actually see me, so if inside this trading range, I'm going to"
"8443230","8450610"," expect Tesla to trade for any ticker, I'm like, the hot, let's just call it ticker ABC, and I'm"
"8450610","8458370"," like, I expect this ticker to trade between 100, my bottom number, and 120, my upper number, and"
"8458370","8462870"," that's my expected range, right, and then I'm going to say to myself, well, whenever I see an"
"8462870","8467190"," expected range on a ticker, right, and this is pretty, pretty good at this, right, my trader's"
"8467190","8473010"," investor, then I also know that we're going to trade outside of that range on the high and below"
"8473010","8479230"," that range on the low, right, so when I, my price target this summer for Tesla was, I think it"
"8479230","8483670"," was 1,100 or 1,000, it was like 1,000 bucks, 1,100 bucks, we ended up getting that"
"8483670","8489470"," Hertz news, traded up to 1,200 bucks, traded outside of my expected range, right, so we traded up"
"8489470","8495910"," to 1,200 bucks, became very risky to hold up there, because outside of the expected range, right,"
"8495990","8501230"," so everybody's like, whoo, that's awesome, so we're down at 800 bucks, my expected range, what are"
"8501230","8503570"," the chances of us trading below it, even if it's only briefly?"
"8504250","8509550"," Probably, it's probably as good as us trading up 1,200, right, probably a fair chance that at some"
"8509550","8515230"," point, we get below 800, so the next question is, how do you get below 800 if the technicals, if"
"8515230","8522750"," the TA, if the fundamentals, if the PE, if all this other stuff doesn't match up, why would we"
"8522750","8529010"," trade below 800, what would be the reason for us to trade below 800, and the only answer is that"
"8529010","8535530"," we have some sort of market risk, right, that doesn't involve Tesla directly, so if the market"
"8535530","8541470"," starts to sell off at any point, if we trade down to 400 or 420 or 390 or something like"
"8541470","8548250"," that, you would get algorithmic selling of these tickers, and so if there's a brief moment where we"
"8548250","8554750"," trade down down to 750 or 775, rather than panicking, I'm going to get excited and try to buy that"
"8554750","8561010"," dip, and I'm looking to buy that dip down at that 750, 775, that brief moment that we're down"
"8561010","8565730"," there, I'm going to try to scoop that up, when everybody, and you'll see, this is also another"
"8565730","8571610"," indicator, right, you'll see, you'll see CNBC, say, oh my god, the world's burning, you'll see bull"
"8571610","8576770"," saying, oh my god, the world's burning, you'll say bull say, you'll see Paris saying, look, market"
"8576770","8580490"," doom, everything's going to go to hell in a hand basket, and those are the really the right times"
"8580490","8584670"," as a bull to be like, oh yeah, I want to buy, I remember last summer when it was down"
"8584670","8590670"," at 550, that, dude, I've got the posts where I had like a hundred comments of people saying, you're"
"8590670","8595350"," fucking crazy, don't fucking buy this, this is the fucking worst mistake in the entire world,"
"8595930","8605170"," fucking awful, what are you doing, so, uh oh, Putin, Putin saying that the Minsk agreement no"
"8605170","8614930"," longer exists after Russia recognized the town tax region, oh oh, Putin's buying puts,"
"8615950","8622650"," so you're, so I guess just that conversation is that outside of all the fundamentals and the TA and"
"8622650","8629590"," all the other fucking bullshit that you hear out there, these things happen, and they happen, uh"
"8629590","8637630"," they happen more often than you would think, right, these tail risk events, tail risk moments on"
"8637630","8643010"," tickers and the market, they do happen, they don't happen frequently, but they do happen, and we"
"8643010","8649130"," saw it happen this past summer, this was a tail, it was not a risk, but a tail for about"
"8649130","8655110"," buying opportunity this past summer, so I know that if we trade that, I already know right now"
"8655110","8661970"," before we even get there, I'm gonna watch an SPXU calls, racks of them coming in right now, uh"
"8661970","8671210"," sweeps $67,000 right, there's a one, two, three, four, five, five of them, March 18th, 16c SPXU,"
"8671590","8679610"," more apple puts coming in right now, more SPXU calls coming in right now, apple puts March 18th, 16 "
"8679610","8688210",".5, $23,000, so like I already can tell you right now, if we trade down at $750 right, and"
"8688210","8692830"," nerdy know I'm gonna have people sitting in the water, heavy calendar in terms of treasury sales,"
"8692890","8697170"," we're gonna get the three and six month bill auctions here just after the bottom of the hour, and"
"8697170","8703370"," in about 90 minutes time we'll get a 52 week, 34 million dollar 52 week bill auction, we'll also"
"8703370","8710310"," see a two year note auction at one o'clock, eastern time as well, get some weakness in the market"
"8710310","8715530"," right now, just heads up guys, real careful right now, this might be probably gonna trade down"
"8715530","8725390"," here, there are XP, the XPXU calls, just kept flowing in, one, two, pi-ago scores, one, two, three,"
"8725850","8735930"," four, five, six, seven, eight sets of them, March 18th, 16c, March 18th, 16c,"
"8741350","8746930"," so yeah so that's my point is that you look for these moments in the market, you look for when"
"8746930","8751870"," we trade outside of ours, opening up applications for a $1 billion in airport infrastructure,"
"8752390","8762590"," that's a good one, airport infrastructure, now"
"8762590","8765750"," so those that's where I'm looking to trade, I'm looking to trade to find the trade that's outside"
"8765750","8771350"," of our normal trading area, take along there or a short there, same thing is applied, this same"
"8771350","8776190"," conversation is me applying, hey where are you taking a short captain, well I want to take it at"
"8776190","8781490"," 440, I don't want to take it at 436, I don't want to take it at the short down here"
"8781490","8788510"," 430, I don't want to take it at 430, I want to take it at 440, that's where I want"
"8788510","8793770"," to take it short, if I miss this short, so be it, I miss the trade, but I can promise"
"8793770","8799290"," you that more times than not grabbing the short or the long outside of your normal trading range,"
"8799670","8803850"," you're going to be rewarded more frequently than you are with diddling in the middle, right?"
"8808450","8825350"," Is this a webcam fucking boy shit, this is nonsense, what"
"8825350","8832560"," are they trying to sell, they want to sell me porn cams, let me get naked on camera, walls, Paul's"
"8832560","8844610"," saying the wheels are on spy February 28th, 392 P, so"
"8844610","8848770"," I don't really care about it, it's Tesla trading higher, the only thing I'm looking for in Tesla is"
"8848770","8856210"," an opportunity to, 6 month bill across 0.710% with 82.17% a lot at the high and"

"8880710","8890550"," cover of 3.07. Yeah, the"
"8890550","8898330"," question about that, if you're a small time western in Tesla, you're playing a waiting game, you're"
"8898330","8905990"," waiting for the right time to go throw the kitchen sink at Tesla, that's what you're looking for,"
"8906330","8913890"," kitchen sink, and you know, it's not until 75, that's me kitchen sink, I'll start trading Tesla"
"8913890","8921890"," every day down at 750, that we'll just focus on Tesla every single day, but until then, for me,"
"8922010","8923630"," it's not ready for me."

"8977610","8982150"," open up a, can you get, you guys just have charts, right?"
"8982330","8983230"," Don't you guys have a chart?"
"8984450","8987730"," Did you guys see where the real shorts are and where the real lungs are?"
"8987730","8994010"," Or you can look up any chart on spy and cashmark and see where the short and where the long,"
"9002520","9005340"," you guys didn't see that it's over, you know, more than a day."
"9009600","9013260"," Hell yeah, I want to see us, I want to see us trade higher to four, not, I don't think"
"9013260","9017800"," we get to fork exactly 440, but I want to see the short higher. "
"9018580","9022980"," I want to see any bullshit news come out that trap shorts that enter too early."
"9025800","9030820"," Cooten speaking to a television address once again, just saying that the Ukraine must be"
"9031460","9033520"," demilitarized and give up its NATO ambitions."
"9036440","9038380"," Yeah, yeah, that's never happened again. "
"9039380","9040820"," You fucked that all up."
"9052300","9053760"," Pete Thompson going down now."
"9054920","9055440"," Charts?"
"9056140","9056400"," What charts?"
"9057680","9060700"," You guys open up any chart for a spy, right?"
"9061340","9063340"," Just open up a month chart on the spy. "
"9068940","9070840"," Where's the where's the long and the shorts?"
"9071420","9072800"," Like the short was where?"
"9073860","9074820"," February 2nd?"
"9076560","9077980"," Right, there's another one where?"
"9078500","9079560"," February 9th?"
"9080500","9081420"," There was another one where?"
"9082260","9083140"," February 16th, right?"
"9083340","9085860"," He's also getting an upgrade to investment grade by Fitch."
"9086080","9090160"," That's letter M raised to investment grade for Macy's."
"9090900","9092260"," So I don't know that it's here. "
"9092380","9096600"," I'm not saying that it isn't to take a short here, but just looking at it."
"9096600","9101560"," I'm like, yeah, I'd really like to see us go back up here and get around this 440 area and"
"9101560","9102360"," take it one more time."
"9102800","9104220"," I'm not saying we don't trade down here. "
"9105960","9107440"," I'm just saying that the risk."
"9109920","9114400"," So if I took a short here and we didn't, it didn't work, that would mean I'm only three for"
"9114400","9114760"," four."
"9116040","9118900"," I'd rather be four from four and nine for ten. "
"9125550","9127030"," Yeah, Putin's going to go ham a week."
"9128390","9129750"," I'm a little bit of a shark."
"9132850","9133650"," Yes, Ken. "
"9133910","9134850"," You're more than welcome to."
"9141560","9146160"," More IWM calls February 25th, 200 C."

"9157080","9160400"," February 22nd, 340 C."
"9161040","9162460"," We'll get out of here real quick. "
"9193740","9199340"," Let's look up, let's add a period indicator here."
"9202180","9203580"," We'll come back to it once it loads."
"9231080","9234800"," I'm going to basically tell me, look at it, my position, look at my ass and go fuck myself. "
"9235880","9244530"," The rebound from fake optimism."
"9244710","9246570"," Was there optimism last night?"
"9247970","9249130"," I didn't think there was."
"9253190","9255450"," I didn't think there was any optimism last night. "
"9258390","9265890"," Let me see here, we got QQQ's puts February 22nd, 338, P for $86,000."
"9279480","9280440"," Yeah, Vix is weird."
"9280620","9286560"," I was seeing a support, a reversal candle on Vix, now another support candle on Vix. "
"9295150","9296010"," Yeah, it's mostly sideways."
"9297110","9297850"," I haven't bought anything yet."
"9298630","9299070"," I haven't sold anything. "
"9301210","9305030"," I literally was posting a position to close."
"9306670","9307410"," They bought me one instead."
"9310590","9312070"," They have been so far, right?"
"9314430","9315610"," They're still burning premiums. "
"9316410","9317550"," They're going to let you all load up."
"9317730","9321250"," You guys are going to load up in long and shorts right now, who are long puts, long calls."
"9322890","9324170"," You guys are going to just load them up. "
"9334350","9343680"," I think if you're, I think if you're, I think if you're looking to take a short, I think the"
"9343680","9344380"," play is higher."
"9346180","9347640"," Unless some other news comes into the market."
"9349660","9356680"," You'd have to have like a fucking, what's his name, putting on the fucking hits right now, putting"
"9356680","9357140"," on the puts. "
"9357480","9358640"," You'd have to come out and do something crazy."
"9359280","9365380"," You'd have to have Biden come out with some kind of crazy news at two o'clock."
"9365980","9368960"," That's the volatility in the market right now. "
"9372180","9378980"," And if you don't see that, I think we drift higher until we get more volatility on Thursday,"
"9379260","9379820"," Friday."
"9387030","9388330"," We'll look at a Home Depot too."
"9389950","9391770"," We'll get Home Depot next after I have you in. "
"9393910","9398090"," Doing look at Home Depot last week and said it needs to come down to like a hundred or something"
"9398090","9402450"," stupid like that, regardless of what they're saying in their, in their ERs."
"9403930","9406990"," I think Home Depot is one of those companies that's hold held the entire market up."
"9411400","9412840"," Yeah, nothing going out with the spy. "
"9413380","9414080"," Look at IWM."
"9416300","9417440"," It's bashing around."
"9421710","9423870"," I'm going to look at J&K too. "
"9424650","9425990"," I meant to look at J&K."
"9427130","9432290"," I did not get the J&K's holding up nicely."
"9433930","9437490"," There ain't no, there ain't no market sell in the market right now. "
"9438410","9444150"," There's risk on and junk bonds, so I don't know unless there's something missing here."
"9447410","9449950"," The low last week was on the 14th."
"9450010","9450890"," I think we traded this high. "
"9451330","9452950"," We traded this up on the 14th."
"9453930","9457110"," This is when it races, we're selling off and we end up trading higher."
"9459710","9461530"," Junk bonds still has a bid in it. "
"9471310","9478390"," We have IWM traded down to $196.73. Had a buy candle in the open, then a reversal candle."
"9479570","9480650"," A second hour of trading."
"9481490","9483710"," Let's see if I'd have themselves down or not. "
"9484250","9488750"," There's been lots of calls coming in on IWM, but I don't know if I believe them."
"9493930","9495990"," I'm going to do a dive place for IWM, huh?"
"9499950","9501270"," I'm going to have everyone who's messy today."
"9511380","9512460"," Let's see if we can look any lower. "
"9520730","9522690"," It'll link any of this support down here."
"9528990","9534110"," Week down to $188.50 on IWM."
"9535870","9537510"," Dangerous would be in a bowl down here. "
"9544390","9553330"," Dangerous ENPH Golden Ticket March 18th, 130P, $1.4 million"
"9553330","9560050"," Golden Ticket ENPH March 18th, 130P, $1.4 million."
"9578120","9579060"," Good Amazon."
"9579460","9581240"," Next I've ever someone asked for Amazon. "
"9636800","9638800"," Let's see where real buyers are on Amazon."
"9650520","9651920"," Hello, can Amazon go?"
"9659070","9659370"," 2,900?"
"9664480","9665460"," Good and lower."
"9673440","9673720"," 2,800. "
"9677000","9680230"," 2,800."
"9682780","9683020"," Nasty."
"9692110","9693410"," You guys want to see Peton?"
"9698960","9699560"," Peton. "
"9718950","9723010"," Let Peton load up."
"9745760","9746980"," All right, what's going on here?"
"9749540","9750920"," Support on Peton."
"9752420","9753760"," We'll get Peton real quick. "
"9758130","9759110"," What else do we have?"
"9760890","9762490"," I'll look at EMPH next."
"9764010","9765910"," Shit, bag-hold or bobby?"
"9766510","9767630"," When is Santa Rally coming?"
"9768570","9770710"," Bro, we had a Santa Rally in October."
"9771070","9772590"," We had twice in December. "
"9773450","9775030"," We had bang in Santa Rally's, bro."
"9777850","9779870"," They had to get pondered on Friday there."
"9780350","9781130"," Santa's not real. "
"9781610","9784450"," Peton just spent a few minutes arguing about how your crane could acquire nuclear weapons."
"9787750","9794810"," No worries, I had a shot at some more tickers, and we'll take a look at some tickers here for"
"9794810","9795190"," you guys."
"9799420","9807900"," I think there was questions if Ukraine still has some kinds of weapons of mass destruction, if"
"9807900","9812900"," they've got gas or maybe even nukes that no one knows about. "
"9813340","9816700"," They were the largest holder of nuclear warheads, I think, in the Iron Curtain."
"9816780","9818880"," I think back in the day they were it."
"9820120","9823180"," So Peton sports at $25, $25, $48. "
"9828230","9829290"," More buyers than sellers currently."
"9830990","9832110"," $25, $41."
"9835010","9835650"," And then below $20. "
"9842710","9847910"," Microsoft calls 318, March 18, 300c, $466."
"9855260","9855820"," Peton."
"9858780","9860180"," Already did Palantair. "
"9861400","9861960"," ADI?"
"9862740","9863480"," VA, please."
"9864140","9864500"," All right, hold on."
"9864860","9865140"," ADI?"
"9870500","9876600"," You guys sometimes want some kick-ass tickers to look at too, so I trust you guys are saying calls"
"9876600","9877060"," on Apple. "
"9878360","9883400"," March 18, 170c, spy calls, February 23, $4.32c, $20,000."
"9890670","9891470"," CDI, real ticker."
"9892930","9893650"," Analog devices. "
"9895890","9896710"," Well, that went up."
"9898030","9899150"," Look at Roblox, too."
"9901690","9902690"," Yeah, it is corrupt. "
"9903390","9906370"," They had a real problem with that lone wolf, with corruption that came in."
"9906770","9908210"," That rush had the same fucking problem, too."
"9910590","9912690"," I don't know if it's crazy accusing someone. "
"9913150","9916710"," You guys have to understand that back in the day that Ukraine had all these weapons."
"9917550","9921390"," They were famous for selling this shit in the black market."
"9921990","9926850"," So it's not improbable to think that Ukraine has some of this stuff still left hidden somewhere. "
"9927350","9927990"," It's not improbable."
"9928650","9930710"," I can't say that it's improbable if they already have them."
"9930830","9936110"," I'm actually surprised Russia saying that Ukraine could acquire these weapons because they've been"
"9936110","9936950"," trained to use them. "
"9937190","9938050"," They used to have them."
"9938710","9941130"," And it's a fair chance that there's some that are hidden."
"9942010","9942890"," More spy calls. "
"9943890","9947510"," February 22nd, 435C, 50,000 spy calls."
"9947790","9950050"," February 22nd, 435C, $58,000."
"9963000","9964060"," Look at ADI. "
"9966140","9968440"," Talked earlier about closing puts."
"9969920","9971740"," Right on spy."
"9972680","9976360"," Say, close your puts and then rebuy in if we break below 430. "
"9977580","9979120"," So there you go."
"9979460","9981520"," Playing out now 15, 20 minutes later."
"9982820","9987880"," That should have helped any of you out there that were short spy to take your money and run. "
"9996460","9998740"," Hopefully some of you guys are following along with that."
"10007550","10007990"," Okay."
"10008730","10011030"," So you've got more buyers than sellers on ADI. "
"10011230","10011530"," Very nice."
"10012170","10014650"," I think that was your right sport from the call that went out."
"10015810","10018090"," Real sellers don't step in until 180. "
"10018830","10020050"," That's beautiful on ADI."
"10020490","10022250"," Good job shouting that one out."
"10026210","10027850"," Got another price target above it. "
"10027850","10029730"," 169, yeah, yeah."
"10030510","10033970"," Hopefully 169, 420 puts 169, 48."
"10036150","10038030"," Next price target above 180. "
"10038890","10040890"," Nice shout out on that ticker."
"10050140","10051000"," Let me see."
"10051180","10051640"," Well, hold on. "
"10051840","10053440"," Miss Yasser going so fast."
"10055020","10056440"," Roblox, I'll do Roblox next."
"10057360","10058340"," Three pounds here earlier. "
"10064310","10064830"," Okay."
"10064930","10065450"," Hold on a second here."
"10065450","10066270"," RBLX. "
"10079650","10082130"," I'm going to have to pause for a minute here guys."
"10082250","10083110"," I'm going to pause."
"10083510","10085470"," I just have someone stopping by real quick. "
"10085630","10086530"," I'm going to have to talk to them."
"10133010","10133830"," I'm going to hand back in."
"10135350","10136230"," So Roblox. "
"10140130","10141350"," Support on 45."
"10143650","10146030"," That's what kind of was a lot of buyers here too."
"10147410","10149070"," 161,000 buyers. "
"10149250","10151250"," Buyers should be able to step up here at 45."
"10152210","10153470"," I like it here at 45."
"10153850","10154310"," We'll look lower. "
"10156910","10159050"," See if any bad news could dump it even more."
"10161010","10163930"," Yeah, you've got strong support heading down to 40."
"10164890","10167490"," So send alert down here at 40 as well. "
"10167810","10169150"," 45 and 40."
"10171450","10172450"," Look even deeper."
"10177510","10179710"," Yeah, 40 looks like pretty strong support. "
"10180010","10181150"," I don't think you get down to 35."
"10182390","10184250"," It's possible, but I doubt it."
"10188760","10190900"," Some spy puts coming in now. "
"10191660","10194640"," February 22nd, 431P, $85,000."
"10195880","10199440"," Spy puts February 25th, 430P, $970,000."
"10201600","10202640"," And Roblox. "
"10206340","10207400"," It's a real ticker."
"10209580","10210800"," It's like rolling all over."
"10210920","10212140"," A lot of war movie that puts. "
"10214020","10214760"," Let me see."
"10215000","10216720"," Where are these tickers you guys looking for?"
"10218060","10220940"," Yeah, tickers are going by so fast right now."
"10221420","10222280"," They're your comments. "
"10229300","10231240"," So yeah, we'll go to HD real quick next."
"10238590","10240170"," Watching puts coming on the queues."
"10240570","10242150"," February 22nd, 335P. "
"10242550","10243750"," Nope, looking for a break in the spy."
"10244850","10246650"," Trading down to 430, 46."
"10248330","10250390"," We'll go hang tight on HD. "
"10250630","10252570"," We're going to look to see if spy can break through 430."
"10255890","10257250"," Or if it's going to hold up 430."
"10267830","10270470"," We'll be watching this dome over here on the right-hand side. "
"10270610","10273850"," You want to see it's at 50,000 buyers right down here."
"10273910","10278290"," You want to see this break down to like 20 or 30,000 for a move lower."
"10278570","10282710"," If you start to see this stay though at like 50,000 or so, it should hold up 430. "
"10295010","10297070"," And this is the way to look at a Home Depot."
"10297570","10299330"," It's said non-support at 318."
"10301070","10302550"," Wave of sellers above. "
"10302870","10306270"," You see this 60,000, 59,000."
"10307050","10310670"," There's only 35, 25, 35,000, 45,000."
"10311330","10312570"," Home Depot still looks weak. "
"10318830","10321130"," And this might be a long time short take."
"10328820","10330580"," The per price started even lower believe it or not."
"10337690","10338470"," Damn, HD. "
"10339830","10340270"," 250."
"10343630","10344610"," Going to look at Home Depot."
"10348270","10349390"," It's currently at 316. "
"10353710","10354870"," That's where I've got my buy."
"10355450","10362530"," I've got a buy set up at 246.35. I wouldn't be shocked to see you trade that low again."
"10365130","10366590"," That's 300 it's showing. "
"10368070","10368730"," 290."
"10373200","10375020"," 290 a local price target."
"10384940","10385600"," 300. "
"10387460","10388880"," I think it can go lower."
"10396360","10397620"," Yeah, right there 250."
"10398800","10404410"," That'll take some time to get there. "
"10406430","10411110"," But shit, if Home Depot doesn't sell the rip over some over a course of time, I don't know what"
"10411110","10411350"," is."
"10414610","10417010"," I think this 300 is light price target."
"10417590","10419210"," Overall from people right now, 250. "
"10420350","10421950"," It might take some time to get there."
"10429900","10430320"," 250."
"10430980","10438500"," All right, let's get the spy. "
"10439020","10440960"," Let's see if it's still hanging out here or not."
"10443100","10444960"," If spy does break at 430."
"10444960","10450000"," You do see this nice support here on spy at 430. "
"10450700","10454900"," But if it does break at any point, we'll look lower to the next target would be."
"10458620","10461120"," There's still that 430 kick in of buyers."
"10463860","10473830"," More buyers down below at 429.26. More hidden buyers down here"
"10473830","10474090"," at 428. "
"10477550","10478630"," Traffic traffic."
"10485210","10487030"," Let's clean this up a little bit."
"10498870","10500890"," There's your 412 down below. "
"10502430","10504330"," Light ice down below here at 420."
"10506030","10508770"," No call structure above, just none."
"10518530","10521350"," Resistance above here localize at 436. "
"10521350","10533210"," 435.93. Damn,"
"10533310","10535250"," Home Depot does not look healthy, does it?"
"10537570","10544930"," Going back to 2020, the low was 140.63. 250 is basically where it was."
"10545830","10548450"," Major support was on Home Depot."
"10549310","10550750"," This is where the banks took. "
"10550870","10551870"," Well, it took a longer 140."
"10552910","10556930"," Consolidated sideways until February 26, 2021."
"10558690","10563970"," Made a move higher from 244 for 420. "
"10569110","10570110"," So yeah, I would see."
"10570230","10574470"," I mean, I don't think Home Depot can trade higher again, close the gap and then trade down."
"10574730","10577070"," But ultimately, probably looking for 250. "
"10577850","10578870"," It might take a long time."
"10579650","10581670"," It might take one to three months."
"10583230","10587410"," When I look at this chart, you know, and then look back on like a Sam Adams chart. "
"10587410","10592610"," The Sam Adams has different reasons for trading lower, but it doesn't matter."
"10593630","10594710"," It's all profit taking."
"10596690","10598450"," Home Depot, price target 250. "
"10598850","10599810"," I don't know if it takes to get there."
"10599990","10603350"," I don't know if we trade higher to 300 again or 350, and then we trade lower."
"10604230","10608150"," Probably need to wait for it to come higher again, to close that gap and then take it lower. "
"10610250","10614210"," 290 would be the first price target, then the next price target blows 250."
"10615090","10621410"," But timing or timing entering that trade is going to take probably probably not right now."
"10621970","10626430"," You probably wait for a trade higher, and then eventually a distribution down. "
"10644320","10648380"," So when an SEC comes from home, I'm actually confident some sort of wrecking will come for them,"
"10648640","10649340"," just inevitability."
"10650360","10652820"," I hope so too, or Tom and Josh."
"10653120","10661820"," I really like to see Vlad be replaced and then add another level or two to new traders entering the"
"10661820","10662080"," market. "
"10662740","10666240"," You probably have the best opportunity to do that of all these companies that are out there doing"
"10666240","10666600"," that shit."
"10667800","10670920"," Saeedi, ENP8, Cinderella."
"10671480","10672100"," Missed all that stuff. "
"10675760","10678100"," Snow for short earnings next week."
"10678320","10678860"," High multiple stock."
"10679140","10679540"," I like snow. "
"10680660","10686980"," I remember the last time Sam, I remember the last time the market had a big sell-off and look"
"10686980","10689720"," at their last big sell-off."
"10689820","10695320"," When the market was cratering in January, if you take that short, if it's a good short, just be"
"10695320","10699580"," careful that you close it when you can."
"10705280","10706720"," Amazon puts print right on. "
"10710010","10710890"," Volatility in."
"10712010","10712810"," Ooh, I missed the moment."
"10713110","10714570"," What are you guys are saying here?"
"10714570","10718190"," This is my chat boxes jumping back and forth. "
"10720050","10720530"," Dole."
"10724210","10725950"," I'm missing a bunch of what you guys are saying."
"10726410","10730130"," I look up Dole. "
"10734070","10734550"," Uber."
"10735510","10735990"," Dole Uber."
"10737050","10738310"," TGT looks worse. "
"10739050","10739790"," Nice heads up on that one."
"10741510","10742770"," Yeah, it does make you a good quote."
"10742930","10743210"," Good point. "
"10743390","10744370"," Your wife's boyfriend unloads."
"10746440","10747180"," P-Y."
"10751210","10752450"," P-V-Y 70. "
"10753030","10753890"," All right, so what am I?"
"10753970","10754670"," You guys I'm going to look at."
"10756250","10757750"," I just missed a bunch of shit."
"10757950","10758070"," Uber. "
"10759370","10760490"," I look at Uber."
"10762690","10763610"," Everybody is looking weak."
"10770010","10771930"," What are you glistening to?"
"10772110","10775350"," I like to get a little ziggy guys. "
"10776710","10781590"," I got Dole up right now."
"10781970","10782690"," Bob Dole."
"10783990","10785050"," Can you remember that guy?"
"10799210","10800230"," Dole looks like a short. "
"10800950","10814330"," I had to"
"10814330","10814910"," pound some water."
"10815170","10819070"," Dole looks like a short to be honest with you."
"10819970","10821230"," See that wallsellers up there?"
"10821730","10822490"," Pretty big wallsellers. "
"10822750","10823750"," I don't know where you trade to."
"10826090","10827890"," There's something going on with Dole we don't know about."
"10835510","10836450"," It's pretty nasty. "
"10838110","10838390"," Looking chart."
"10840670","10841630"," Be honest with you."
"10845440","10846680"," Be wary of this chart. "
"10854720","10856340"," P-V-Y even look at P-V-Y."
"10858680","10862020"," You were like all those guys are dead now, right?"
"10862240","10867560"," You had like old George Bush, the grandfather or whatever."
"10868280","10870540"," He's got a World War II fighter pilot. "
"10870980","10873580"," Like Bob Dole was an old World War II."
"10874940","10876260"," Look at these guys up."
"10876880","10878100"," And then you look at the guys we have today. "
"10878460","10880380"," You get all the politicians today."
"10881170","10882860"," Like loan spurs."
"10883400","10884600"," And I went to college. "
"10884760","10886820"," I was in the National Guard."
"10887740","10889360"," Like you the old school politicians."
"10890500","10891660"," It would be crazy. "
"10893160","10894140"," Like them or not."
"10894460","10898500"," Like just their backgrounds are way different than the backgrounds of most politicians today."
"10901180","10902940"," Spy put Joby calls baby. "
"10903520","10907520"," Joby June 15th, 7.5 C, $176,000."
"10908100","10909580"," Mixed bag of spy calls and puts."
"10909580","10912640"," Now this is all retail traders trying to catch up. "
"10913800","10917460"," All I see is lots of retail traders buying calls and puts on the indexes right now."
"10920200","10921160"," Like back and forth."
"10921400","10922100"," Just loading up the boat. "
"10931650","10932790"," Just half-assertly."
"10933850","10934370"," They don't care."
"10934570","10935710"," They don't care when they get in. "
"10935950","10937830"," They're like fucking on buying calls and buying puts."
"10940310","10943650"," We've got a B-V-Y price target above 100."
"10944470","10945910"," Sitting on some major support of 91. "
"10946650","10948850"," 79 more buyers than sellers right now."
"10949730","10953050"," Well, they are looking for a higher price of 100."
"10954430","10956130"," Who I look healthy right now. "
"10957070","10957610"," I'm not going to lie."
"10957770","10958130"," It's a good chart."
"10967170","10969690"," Make sure I've got a good connection on. "
"10971370","10973590"," You're listening to Trade the News."
"10973590","10974290"," And reset my connection."
"10974630","10976710"," Make sure I get a good connection on Trade the News. "
"10978850","10981190"," Not all of a lot going on the market today."
"10981890","10983190"," I'm still at least in the indexes."
"10984450","10989990"," We saw the first test of 435 off the bell. "
"10990550","10996850"," We traded higher to 435.50. We traded lower down to 430.45 again and retested."
"10997490","10999090"," So you've tested it twice now."
"10999930","11004290"," If you're a bear you want to see us go down there a third time. "
"11004950","11009630"," If you can't break below 430.45 a third time I would expect to move higher."
"11011410","11013090"," No, that's the expectation at least."
"11013870","11019250"," So you've got some cues or puts coming in February 25th 335 P for 350. "
"11020530","11025210"," Choose March 11th 340 P for $902,000."
"11025450","11027330"," I don't think anybody thinks we're going up."
"11027850","11031530"," I just want to clarify my statement at 440. "
"11032230","11037890"," Because I don't think anyone thinks we're going like higher than 440 or if unless Biden says"
"11037890","11038830"," something awesome sauce."
"11039630","11044950"," Even if we trade a 450 over the next day then to Wednesday I think it's minimal, right?"
"11045390","11046770"," That's the most that we trade to."
"11048450","11049950"," Spakima said the same, right?"
"11050590","11052930"," So then the question just becomes where do you take short?"
"11053850","11054910"," Where do you take a short position?"
"11055150","11055910"," Where do you take a long position?"
"11057950","11063010"," You can see that a lot of puts being put on the market for us to trade lower. "
"11063270","11066430"," So do the question just becomes when do you want to take a short in the market?"
"11067230","11068590"," When do you feel most confident in it?"
"11068590","11070130"," When are you going to get paid on them?"
"11073330","11081650"," Where do you think the placement of those puts or shorting contracts on futures on the mini?"
"11082690","11091010"," I don't think any of you guys are doing big contracts on the ES but maybe I was reading something"
"11091010","11099710"," somewhere yesterday about at least at the forest traders to buy the ES to trade the mini back in"
"11099710","11100190"," the day, I guess."
"11101350","11108590"," Someone was commenting on that somewhere, like for the internet."
"11111340","11112800"," Maybe at Joby calls again. "
"11119630","11122790"," Nope, just a little Tesla too, we about to ride."
"11124770","11126010"," Oh yeah, so we'll look at snow."
"11126870","11131230"," Yeah, so snow treats snow like you treat apple right now. "
"11131670","11139050"," It's a market hedge so you can short it but take a look back at snow back in late January"
"11139990","11144510"," when the market was weak, it traded lower but it was really fast."
"11144790","11147410"," It was like you had to get in and get out to short snow."
"11148890","11151650"," You couldn't like hold just hold puts on snow. "
"11151830","11156770"," It it rebounded and it's one of the market hedge stocks."
"11156970","11161450"," You'll be selling four billion year-on-five year bonds along with the one and a quarter billion and"
"11161450","11166070"," floating bonds and three billion and ten year bonds on February 25th, that's Italy."
"11168540","11169560"," We'll let up snow. "
"11171540","11174620"," I'm sure there's some real bears out there that want to see snow die."
"11176400","11177800"," Snow is like shop, right?"
"11178440","11183920"," Snow is like if you knock snow down, you can really kill it."
"11184220","11185980"," You can destroy it, right?"
"11187280","11192860"," It was trading as high as 405, traded as deeply as a real four. "
"11193840","11199280"," As a matter of fact, this would be a good ticker to compare to Home Depot, the way that it's"
"11199280","11199880"," selling down."
"11200400","11206980"," I bet if you compare this to Sam, it's the same overall short strategy."
"11207600","11210760"," But the key on this one is that it jumps back and forth. "
"11211440","11212900"," So it was as high as 327."
"11213940","11215920"," Now it's trading down to 266."
"11217380","11222520"," It's a ticker that you get to short and then get the fuck out of it as soon as you"
"11222520","11222760"," can. "
"11223100","11225840"," Take your money and run every time because it does trade higher quickly."
"11227560","11236810"," Whatever you compare, like snow, Samuel Adams, and then look at Home Depot where it's at and"
"11236810","11238490"," see the trading pattern."
"11240620","11243600"," Hey, Henry, hey buddy, how you doing?"
"11244980","11245980"," Doing up there, bud?"
"11246660","11247140"," Doing that outside?"
"11249980","11250500"," I like the snow. "
"11250620","11251500"," I like the snow short."
"11251740","11253260"," It looks appetizing, doesn't it?"
"11254000","11255600"," I want to see it trade down like 230s."
"11260450","11261470"," It's a fast mover. "
"11271070","11275670"," I'm watching calls from the queues on IWM still."
"11284890","11288750"," Lots of buyers down on snow or at 250."
"11289690","11291450"," They even suck easily break there. "
"11299020","11300920"," 250 looks like real buyers."
"11301640","11303560"," 200 would be the ultimate price target."
"11305000","11311460"," So if you're tuning in, we're out showing you the Home Depot book map, same kind of a situation. "
"11314660","11315220"," Similar."
"11316020","11317120"," Compare all these tickers."
"11317340","11319020"," You can go on like trading view, compare tickers. "
"11321320","11326820"," Samuel Adams is a good representation of what happened to it and what will basically happen to"
"11326820","11327900"," snow."
"11330300","11331360"," Probably Home Depot."
"11348310","11352430"," I'm watching more calls on Nike February 25th, 140c. "
"11352990","11355650"," Those are both high-ago scores from early this morning."
"11357030","11359870"," Nike 225, 140c, $55,000."
"11372870","11373890"," You guys want to see a dog?"
"11375010","11375490"," Hold on a second. "
"11375690","11375990"," Show you dogs."
"11376950","11377810"," Very good boy."
"11385730","11392940"," This is my panicky little. "
"11393600","11394800"," This is my..."
"11394800","11395440"," Hell yelp."
"11396240","11396800"," Come here."
"11400650","11403890"," This is my boy Henry. "
"11404630","11405750"," He doesn't like being up here."
"11412870","11414210"," This is the dog that uh..."
"11418430","11421770"," Now he wants to get back up."
"11425930","11428110"," This is my coyote hunter, believe it or not. "
"11433110","11434850"," Then I got another, I got a border collie too."
"11444220","11445080"," The uh..."
"11445080","11446540"," I'm gonna probably get the border collie down here."
"11447380","11448360"," Where's Jack?"
"11450100","11451080"," Do you want to go outside?"
"11452600","11453080"," I know. "
"11459010","11461450"," I was hoping to get the other dog down here."
"11461970","11462830"," More Jovi calls."
"11463530","11468690"," March 18th, 5c, $100,000, $48,000, $48,000. "
"11473810","11474810"," Look back up."
"11475270","11475590"," Huh?"
"11475990","11479750"," And here you go."
"11480450","11481050"," Where's the hi?"
"11482390","11483310"," Where's the hi?"
"11487370","11489690"," You're the good boy. "
"11492800","11493480"," You want a bark?"
"11494500","11494880"," Like whoa!"
"11501410","11503410"," You want to show that sexy tester?"
"11506190","11510170"," French Foreign Minister announcing an EU sanctions deal."
"11510910","11516710"," He ministers supporting a package of Russian sanctions over Ukraine moves."
"11518010","11518790"," Look at Jack. "
"11520850","11521830"," All right, that's enough."
"11524030","11525910"," Oh yeah, more Jovi calls right now."
"11525970","11526890"," So we'll get Jovi next. "
"11528830","11533180"," I don't even know why he's down here."
"11533360","11535280"," I'm kind of wondering why he's here because he uh..."
"11536300","11538680"," I've got a daughter's that he loves."
"11539980","11541240"," He usually won't leave him alone. "
"11544360","11546600"," He used to hunt coyotes outside for me."
"11554790","11557410"," We'll get Jovi's lots of calls coming in on Jovi right now."
"11563210","11565130"," More buyers than sellers on Jovi. "
"11566110","11567730"," It looks like they're hitting some kind of support."
"11568910","11571690"," There won't be anybody okay?"
"11573490","11574270"," Let's do it on."
"11575530","11584090"," Let's look at Jovi real quick. "
"11585190","11587230"," See why it's got so many calls coming in."
"11590570","11592510"," I don't know, I don't know if I buy Jovi here."
"11593330","11595690"," I need a lot of buyers here right now. "
"11597010","11599650"," The 502 between here and 450."
"11601390","11606730"," But still the majority of buyers are down below at 405-381."
"11609370","11610630"," Not a lot of sellers here. "
"11612090","11614290"," You've got them like a mixed bag of buyers and sellers."
"11615710","11618890"," If you want to take a long on Jovi again."
"11621670","11626730"," I might not get this low, but I keep an eye at 411-382. "
"11640200","11641780"," It doesn't usually hang out with me."
"11641920","11643920"," So I'm kind of wondering why he doesn't want to leave my side right now."
"11644720","11645260"," It's kind of nice. "
"11654020","11657380"," Sometimes our neighbors' dogs go outside and roam around our yard."
"11657740","11661560"," And we're coming to me to try to get out to play with the neighbors' dogs."
"11665470","11668910"," So SPY is trading lower here, 430-58. "
"11669290","11671570"," That's the same little area of support down here, 430."
"11673910","11678430"," Weak buyers down below, only 24,000-30,000."
"11679210","11681250"," Looks like the buyers are stepping lower. "
"11681250","11683130"," They're still down here at 430."
"11687450","11689730"," Let's see if we can see any more price targets lower from here."
"11692730","11694770"," No, they haven't pulled the rug yet. "
"11697730","11699250"," You want to see like a rug pull."
"11699350","11702030"," You want to see like 30,000, 40,000 down here."
"11704990","11705970"," No rug pull yet. "
"11712650","11714030"," Yeah, he's fluffy in the winter time."
"11714170","11717470"," I call my little Tootsie Roll in the winter time he puts on this coat."
"11717470","11718550"," He's a tiny dog. "
"11719010","11722110"," If it's summer time, he's real thin."
"11722350","11723370"," He's skinny right now, too."
"11723810","11726010"," He just gros this thick coat in the winter time. "
"11727550","11728870"," More Joby calls."
"11731170","11732410"," JPM calls."
"11733610","11736310"," April 14th, 160C, $1.2 million. "
"11744230","11748450"," My other dog is a purebred border collie."
"11749050","11749450"," It's a blue mural."
"11750040","11752650"," This one here is some kind of..."
"11752650","11756610"," Or he's an Aussie shepherd and some kind of a terrier mix. "
"11758850","11764190"," I donate to a shelter for no-kill shelters for dogs."
"11765110","11766130"," They were going to put him down."
"11769430","11770590"," No one would take him. "
"11770830","11772250"," He had a bunch of problems."
"11772750","11773080"," He had a..."
"11774190","11774850"," His owner died."
"11776010","11777070"," He was left in the house with his owner. "
"11777890","11779330"," And nobody wanted him."
"11780070","11780750"," So I took him."
"11781130","11782410"," And he's been a great dog. "
"11782650","11783730"," He is an attack dog."
"11783730","11784510"," Oh, he's not an attack dog."
"11784510","11787150"," He was an attack humans, but he attacked small animals. "
"11788010","11789250"," So we used him."
"11789570","11790130"," I had coyotes."
"11790310","11791090"," They lived out in the middle of nowhere. "
"11791250","11792630"," I had lots of coyotes, like packs."
"11792950","11793850"," Like hundreds at a time."
"11794590","11801090"," And he protected my daughters and protected my animals. "
"11801450","11802130"," All this stuff, like chickens."
"11803890","11805270"," And he would run the coyotes off."
"11805930","11807770"," I actually play with them sometimes too. "
"11811490","11814090"," He likes to go after small animals."
"11815450","11817170"," Chickens, sometimes too, believe it or not."
"11817610","11818790"," He caught a couple chickens once. "
"11819570","11823110"," We would separate the chickens from the chickens' rabbits and stuff."
"11823370","11826490"," From him and the Border Colli."
"11826730","11828710"," Border Colli protects, period. "
"11829030","11832870"," But he's going to hunt her instinct inside of him."
"11844750","11847930"," So you have the third test right now of the spy."
"11848650","11850230"," So this is test number three. "
"11850350","11851770"," You got one, two, and three."
"11852790","11859830"," Now, if we were in a bullish stance, if the market was very bullish right now, under every"
"11859830","11864110"," circumstance under the world, more Joby calls coming in."
"11866090","11868270"," Maybe there's some news on Joby they don't know about. "
"11868630","11870450"," There's going to be something coming out with Joby."
"11871710","11874590"," There are lots of dip buyers coming in on Joby right now."
"11876500","11881380"," Not in normal circumstances if this was like, if we were in a normal environment with a positive"
"11881380","11888940"," gamma, and if we were in any of the time of the market, I would say, right now, this would"
"11888940","11889640"," be a super bullish. "
"11890020","11892980"," You can still say new e-sanctions will hurt Russia a lot."
"11895500","11899720"," But seeing this weakness here at 430 right now, we're a third test of 430."
"11900640","11907800"," I don't like seeing us testing this third time and not seeing a firm reaction here. "
"11908360","11911000"," So I'm not a fan of this."
"11911240","11918380"," I don't like seeing a third test of a support level and not seeing like a ricochet off 430."
"11920220","11921840"," I'm not a fan of this right now. "
"11927390","11934770"," I want to see a firm move higher, a firm rejection off of support to a higher number, and we're"
"11934770","11937830"," not seeing that currently in the market."
"11939890","11941510"," It's not a good look for the spy."
"11950450","11953310"," Typically, you should say fierce right here. "
"11953410","11954410"," This would be a fierce reaction."
"11955730","11960410"," Or even if we traded lower for a brief moment, let's say we traded lower to 428 or something, you'd"
"11960410","11961610"," see a huge reaction."
"11961650","11962910"," We'd move much, much higher. "
"11963370","11965350"," So I'm now liking this trickling sideways."
"11966730","11970270"," It's a 1230 in the afternoon."
"11971210","11975050"," I'm not a fan of seeing this action as we head into the 1230 hour. "
"12003350","12008090"," Yeah, so Biden's administration has prepared export controls to hit Russian companies with alleged"
"12008090","12013390"," military ties and deny Russian's access to global tech, putting electronics and computers sources."
"12015750","12018330"," I want to see more details on this."
"12018510","12019250"," This is from Walter Bloomberg. "
"12020030","12022530"," I want to see more details on exactly who they're going to hit."
"12024330","12026210"," It says if Russia further invades Ukraine."
"12027270","12032010"," Biden administration could drive it a vast swath of low and high tech U.S. and foreign made goods. "
"12033030","12036610"," Like which foreign get made goods are they talking about from commercial electronics, computers,"
"12036990","12038070"," semiconductors, and aircraft parts?"
"12038970","12045970"," People familiar with the, you'd still want more definition on this."
"12051540","12059300"," You're seeing a breach currently of the spy testing a breach of 430."
"12064760","12068160"," Brief break below here, 430-26. "
"12069640","12071980"," I just touched a new low on the day."
"12084810","12085950"," Dogs on Prozac."
"12086350","12092430"," Yeah, I'll check Uber right now for you guys. "
"12095030","12100530"," The, um, yeah, the dog had problems before."
"12100790","12102950"," So the first two or three years we had it."
"12104630","12105390"," Had him. "
"12107110","12108910"," It was a lot of work."
"12110230","12112190"," He had anxiety problems."
"12113350","12115250"," He had a, he couldn't leave him alone. "
"12115450","12115910"," That kind of stuff."
"12117090","12118850"," He was locked in the house for like a week with this guy."
"12118950","12119630"," He ended up eating the guy. "
"12121490","12122650"," He didn't have any food."
"12122650","12123850"," Is he a his owner?"
"12125490","12128150"," Who I was told, uh, I guess he was, uh, his companion."
"12128170","12129150"," It was just him and the dog. "
"12131870","12137850"," And, uh, say like all kinds of issues, but he's done well over the years."
"12138230","12141850"," I think I've had him now for at least seven or eight years now."
"12143810","12144790"," Somewhere in there, right?"
"12145070","12146430"," Seven or eight years, I think I've had him now. "
"12146710","12147330"," But he used to run away."
"12147470","12148690"," It was all, we had all kinds of issues."
"12149730","12150910"," And, uh, it didn't matter. "
"12151110","12151670"," We loved him."
"12151670","12153510"," And he's loved my daughter's support in the world."
"12153950","12155710"," And, um, he's our family. "
"12160470","12163490"," So he'll look see down here and see if they're stepping in or not."
"12163930","12165670"," Just looking for the opportunity to buy or not."
"12180110","12180830"," Yeah, it is. "
"12186630","12190870"," Um, is there good action and writing as emotional as a product?"
"12190870","12192650"," I was like breaking back to ratios."
"12193010","12194330"," Like the kind of good point that said."
"12195470","12196550"," Yeah, he's in love though. "
"12196890","12198410"," He's got, I've got two daughters that love Autumn."
"12198410","12201290"," Like, dog sleeps with my kids, like jumps in the bed."
"12204710","12208430"," Like, like, he like, my kids shouldn't have dug so much freaking love. "
"12209170","12212570"," Like, dog just, like, gets loved on."
"12212990","12214170"," But he demands a lot of love."
"12218030","12233100"," Yeah, I"
"12233100","12234460"," love the more than the entire world. "
"12234740","12235140"," It's a great dog."
"12243190","12244210"," See what we do here with Spy."
"12245130","12247090"," Spy is just kind of kicking around right now, right?"
"12247170","12248290"," It looks like he wants the fucking dump. "
"12252380","12255480"," 1228, we've got an hour and a half until Biden comes out and talks."
"12256320","12257700"," So you might take a long here."
"12258620","12259620"," Looks like he wants the dump. "
"12259800","12261740"," I'm hoping that we can get a quick dump and then maybe a rip."
"12264820","12266660"," You'll get a Biden pump in the market."
"12268840","12269920"," He's been hard to read. "
"12271080","12276200"," Get some Spy puts coming in February 23rd, 436 P for $323,000."
"12276580","12277920"," Get some Spy calls coming in."
"12277920","12282560"," February 25th, 435 C for $28,000. "
"12282760","12284640"," Biden's been a tough one to crack."
"12284920","12288540"," We've seen Biden's speeches around the Ukraine."
"12289760","12291620"," Bring the market up and down. "
"12293420","12294540"," Now we've seen both."
"12297400","12299140"," Well, he moved it to 1 p.m. Thanks, Paul."
"12299360","12299900"," I didn't see that. "
"12301880","12309700"," Yeah, I had the Global Plus package for a book map and then I did have that package and I"
"12309700","12310940"," got rid of it for this stream."
"12311180","12317860"," Believe it or not, I got rid of it and got the cash markets package because most cash market"
"12317860","12323400"," traders are wanting to watch individual tickers."
"12325000","12328820"," So I grabbed the hero indicator and the cash market package for these guys. "
"12331460","12333040"," We have a time on Biden."
"12333300","12334060"," Is it 1 o'clock or no?"
"12338670","12341090"," Is Biden at 1 p.m.? Maybe weakness in the Biden."
"12341870","12343870"," Thank you for the heads up on the time change. "
"12361790","12363150"," Let's see if we can get some weakness here."
"12368960","12373020"," Start and dip its toes down below at 4330, 4320."
"12373460","12376840"," We'll see if we'll try to target down below if we're going to trade lower here. "
"12381550","12392310"," Get a little bit of ice down below at 428, 426,"
"12395570","12400340"," 50, and big buyers at 425."
"12411220","12421190"," Putin, French Foreign Minister saying that the Russian Foreign Minister will not be"
"12421850","12423230"," coming to Paris on Friday."
"12430500","12433280"," Is the French Foreign Minister talking about going to the G7?"
"12433720","12435360"," Is that what that discussion's about?"
"12438820","12448590"," The French Foreign Minister was saying, announces"
"12448590","12449770"," sanctions. "
"12450210","12453090"," EU sanctions deal against Russia over Ukraine actions."
"12455030","12457190"," Lavrov will not come to Paris on Friday."
"12460910","12465110"," EU Foreign Parsley Chief Burrell says EU sanctions will hurt Russia a lot. "
"12465390","12465830"," I doubt that."
"12466490","12467950"," It's like we're breaking through."
"12467950","12469970"," We're trying to break through some support here at 430. "
"12471590","12474390"," We'll get a price target below at 425 if we make the break."
"12478470","12480770"," Now, buyers are stepping in currently though at the moment."
"12481030","12482110"," Let's see if there's a rug bull or not. "
"12497170","12500670"," Russia's getting invited to all the parties except the one of those ones of those."
"12503490","12506250"," Some more spy calls and puts coming in."
"12506250","12510210"," We've got buyers and sellers battling over 430 right now. "
"12520150","12521650"," Let's see if we can break 430."
"12529460","12530540"," I'm going to keep my on."
"12533680","12575290"," Those 430 puts are now to $1.81. We'll"
"12575290","12576950"," have a rug bull going on right now. "
"12576990","12579630"," You can see the buyers moving down to 429."
"12585060","12587440"," I'll leave my cursor over here so you can see them down here."
"12587780","12589080"," I'm going to move my cursor around. "
"12589680","12592660"," I can see them now moving down to 429."
"12605970","12607970"," Let's see if I had the number sign right here."
"12608030","12612170"," You can see them moving even further down out of 428.60 or so. "
"12613810","12614210"," 429."
"12633590","12636550"," Keep your eyes on what you see above 50,000."
"12636770","12638790"," You want to see where it's moving up and down right in here. "
"12639450","12641090"," To my cursor on the bottom right hand side of the screen."
"12669070","12694390"," It's 430 puts now only worth $1.57. Look"
"12694390","12694530"," at Uber."
"12701930","12702930"," Uber's on my short list. "
"12703130","12703410"," I like Uber."
"12704150","12706510"," I like Uber for a merger or an acquisition."
"12709510","12710550"," I like them over time too. "
"12711870","12713830"," Sitting on some major support right now in Uber."
"12714770","12720690"," 33.76. Go as low as looks like the rest of the buyers are down below here at Port 3182."
"12722870","12732750"," Even healthier buyers at $29.79. Maybe the"
"12732750","12734930"," better screen or do my screen here. "
"12740980","12743300"," Some more sellers than buyers right now in Uber."
"12748870","12752510"," I feel like a major sell-off in the market at some point."
"12753110","12754370"," And I want this so bad. "
"12755450","12757190"," I just have traded Uber a bunch in the past."
"12763910","12765990"," I think just grab Uber at a stupid low price."
"12766970","12776260"," $20, $25, $25. "
"12778500","12779460"," I'm an Uber fan."
"12780100","12786100"," I know Uber sucks and he loses money but I like the idea of a car company wrapping up with"
"12786100","12789160"," them or them getting a driverless car down the road."
"12789740","12791040"," It's a long, it's a long hold. "
"12798350","12806110"," You have a Biden speech starting at $12.37. I'm probably going to take a long on this speech."
"12807350","12808730"," Some kind of like bullshit."
"12808970","12809690"," Rah, rah, rah. "
"12812750","12814810"," Everybody's on $4.30. Peas."
"12820510","12823230"," Eh, nobody's on calls in this market right now."
"12842550","12843690"," Yeah, that's a good question. "
"12843930","12845370"," Your wife's boyfriend's asking a great question."
"12846290","12849070"," Oh Wayne's saying the Russia is evacuating diplomats from Ukraine."
"12849070","12850530"," I think it got me up. "
"12850870","12851430"," I don't know."
"12851610","12853290"," I don't think Russia wants it to get nasty."
"12853290","12854750"," There's no point in it getting nasty. "
"12859610","12869160"," Like I don't, I don't think, um, I don't think, uh, hold on, I'm sorry."
"12871820","12873280"," It's the Russia evacuating diplomats."
"12873560","12877000"," It's bizarre because I'm like, man, if you were Russia, all you got to do is absorb those two"
"12877000","12878280"," provinces or those two regions. "
"12879020","12882400"," And you just wait for the, for the microscope to go away for a little bit."
"12882400","12885060"," Then you just, you move it, move it, move it a little bit more to the west."
"12885800","12887860"," And you just slowly over consume the country. "
"12888880","12895800"," But if Ukraine does anything, like if Ukraine fucking gets nasty, now you could get international"
"12895800","12897080"," intervention at some point."
"12897360","12899920"," That's probably Ukraine's only play is to, is to fight."
"12902510","12905230"," And if they're going to, they're going to jerk around, they're going to get absorbed over time,"
"12906710","12915970"," trading out out of $4.30, $2.27. I should have bought that dip down here at $4.29 and"
"12915970","12925510"," $5.4. Let me know a dip by, let me know a chance. "
"12927950","12931430"," I'm going to bring up Biden's speech here, Biden Live."
"12939740","12941180"," He's going to go really the wrong way."
"12941480","12947520"," Probably I should never, ever, ever follow me on these trades because these are the nasty ones"
"12947520","12948820"," where you can just lose everything. "
"12952500","12954200"," You guys can at least witness me take a trade."
"12956120","12958960"," Usually more dangerous ones pay the best."
"12961220","12963300"," We've got spy puts coming in. "
"12964380","12967640"," February 25th, $4.30p, $1.1 million."
"12968560","12970580"," So everybody is fucking short."
"12971280","12973180"," Everybody is like, fuck that, I'm short. "
"12974840","12977420"," Everyone is short right now, the entire market is short."
"12977640","12981680"," You got some are just bought February 25th, $4.30p, $1.1 million."
"12982420","12984380"," They're like, bullshit, we're going down. "
"12987440","12993720"," Biden Live, isn't there like a fucking presidential White House channel so you can get the fastest"
"12993720","12994100"," feed?"
"12994740","12998380"," I think the White House has the fastest feed."
"13000840","13003100"," There we go, there we go."
"13005060","13007860"," Nope, nope, nope, that's not it. "
"13012820","13014820"," There it is right now, there it is."
"13014880","13018960"," President Biden read an update at 1 p.m. on your Russia Ukraine."
"13020200","13021800"," I'm just sitting in here right now. "
"13027640","13028460"," Everybody is short."
"13028600","13030120"," You should see a little bit of weakness from that trade."
"13030760","13032220"," So you should see a brief weakness. "
"13032400","13035460"," It was a sweep which is important to know."
"13035460","13042300"," February 25th, $4.30p, $1.1 million, should see some weakness even if we don't trade lower from"
"13042300","13043320"," just it being a sweep."
"13043780","13045260"," It should impact the market briefly. "
"13045440","13050860"," We should trade down from it even if it's only an impact of a few minutes."
"13051340","13053200"," Could be anywhere from 5 to 5, 5 to 10 minutes."
"13057200","13058940"," We'll see if I can grab something down there. "
"13060340","13062160"," I don't like that everybody is short."
"13062820","13065540"," Like everybody in their fucking sister is short right now."
"13075290","13076550"," Yeah, not financial advice. "
"13086540","13089300"," It's not reverse psychology, they don't want to pay it."
"13090840","13091520"," That's the truth."
"13091980","13094280"," So they will pay it if more sellers come in. "
"13094600","13095420"," That's a weird thing."
"13095660","13099360"," Like if more sellers come in, let's say you get a bunch of put buyers lining up."
"13100300","13103280"," You got like stacks of right, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10. "
"13103820","13104460"," And they're all in."
"13106020","13108020"," And they're all on board waiting for this Biden speech."
"13108020","13114420"," If you don't see more put buyers after they're all on board, then you will see them trade a"
"13114420","13115080"," straight hire. "
"13115280","13117980"," You need to have like two sets of bears."
"13118080","13120720"," You need like the initial bears and then you need more bears."
"13121580","13128540"," Because what they'll do is they'll print the new money coming in to the original put holders and"
"13128540","13131480"," then leave the bag holders to be the bears that jump at the end. "
"13132160","13134780"," So you'll see the bears that are originally by."
"13134780","13139160"," And then, you know, let's say I put position right now."
"13140020","13147180"," And then I'm hoping that more put buyers come in once we trade down, let's say to 425, right?"
"13147380","13150220"," So we hit 425, a bunch more puts are bought. "
"13151180","13153340"," And that means I'm selling them my puts at that point."
"13154220","13154980"," They're holding them."
"13155300","13161340"," And now they're hoping that another wave of put suppliers come in so they can fill that bag now. "
"13161340","13168200"," If we only get this initial round of put buyers and we don't get a second wave once the Biden"
"13168200","13172480"," speech starts, then the market maker is going to be like, well, fuck you ain't paying these puts"
"13172480","13173460"," just because you bought them."
"13173800","13177560"," We need more bag holders to step in to buy down at 425."
"13178540","13181240"," So that's what we're looking for here is. "
"13183040","13186840"," It's for Biden to come out and no more put buyers to step in."
"13189430","13190670"," You guys understand all that?"
"13195170","13197330"," The contrarian trade pays better."
"13199110","13200170"," And believe it or not. "
"13203670","13207510"," And well, the matter issue is just the risk of having to stay short for so long."
"13208210","13213350"," Like having to be fucking short from 9.30 to 1 o'clock in the afternoon is dangerous in and"
"13213350","13213750"," of itself."
"13214810","13219750"," You just need some piece of good news for the ministry saying that Russian embassy personnel in"
"13219750","13220890"," order to leave Ukraine. "
"13223110","13224150"," Yeah, that's not a good sign."
"13224310","13226670"," That's a sign that Ukraine wants to fuck around, which is good."
"13227390","13229090"," I hope Ukraine does fuck around. "
"13231300","13238340"," I was saying yesterday that I think that, you know, while the military is staging, they're very,"
"13238340","13242000"," they're very much like an elephant in a room, right?"
"13242660","13246900"," Once they start moving, they become more dangerous."
"13247280","13252240"," But when you've got all these, you know, they got all these Russian troops that are just staged"
"13252240","13254200"," right now, they're all in parking lots and shit."
"13254980","13263780"," They're an easy target, I mean, Ukraine seeing a report from a major news agency suggesting the"
"13263780","13269700"," military convoy of 4,100 trucks of soldiers has been seeing on its way toward the Ukrainian border"
"13269700","13272760"," in Russia's Belgorod region. "
"13273560","13274580"," That's not good."
"13275920","13277360"," Hey, we are going to sell off."
"13279640","13281370"," Here you got to not buy those calls. "
"13283730","13285930"," The 425 is only 38 cents."
"13289260","13291760"," 425 is only 38 cents right now."
"13298330","13299330"," Oh, now they're 40 cents. "
"13309150","13311610"," Let's see if I was able to catch those or not."
"13315620","13316380"," Oh, sweet."
"13318760","13320060"," So we'll see what happens here. "
"13327510","13329090"," Some spy puts coming in."
"13329970","13333590"," February 23rd, 425 P $87,000."
"13349110","13352310"," Some price targets down below if we do trade lower. "
"13354670","13361030"," $4.28. About 15 minutes to get results of the Treasury's $52 billion two-year note auction."
"13365610","13385810"," $4.27. Traffic all the way down to $4.25. I'm"
"13385810","13387230"," starting to roll over slightly here."
"13387510","13404060"," Now down to $4.29.66. See"
"13404060","13406280"," if the bulls can hold on or if they start to sell it down. "
"13409640","13411600"," Did see a large put position come in."
"13411800","13418780"," It was February 25th for 30 P for $1.1 million at 12.38 PM."
"13426350","13427790"," I'm in some puts right now. "
"13430510","13436170"," I don't like that news of Russians rolling over the border right now."
"13438930","13443910"," You're talking about volatility with a conflict that means that you'll see some fighting."
"13446910","13452850"," Those two breakaway regions do have Ukrainian forces within them even though there are separatists"
"13452850","13456510"," there unless they've pulled back and nobody said anything about it yet. "
"13458010","13468180"," Now trading at $4.29.42. Unless Ukraine forces have pulled back those breakaway regions"
"13468180","13470480"," are still full of Ukrainian troops."
"13470820","13478650"," So if you are seeing Russian troops across the border, you could expect"
"13478650","13484470"," Russians to be seeking out contact with Ukrainian troops."
"13486070","13497060"," A slight"
"13497060","13501260"," rug pull here on the spy down to $4.28 currently. "
"13504140","13505160"," Hell yeah wizard."
"13505940","13507520"," There's some pile on the ground baby."
"13508380","13508880"," Love it. "
"13509380","13510640"," Always love seeing powder."
"13511160","13511860"," Champagne powder."
"13517510","13527360"," Spies tending to roll over right now $4.29.43. Put"
"13527360","13529220"," starting to roll in heavy right now. "
"13529560","13531060"," Warning, market warning to a point."
"13531840","13541080"," We've got February 25th, 425 P, $707,000 QQQs, February 25th, 337 P,"
"13541540","13545940"," $359,000 warning right now."
"13546380","13550860"," Spy puts February 25th, 425 P, $718,000. "
"13552580","13554360"," Now be careful out there right now."
"13555000","13558040"," There are a lot of puts rolling into the market currently."
"13559400","13565340"," As we know, trade hider just there's a lot of short dated spy puts rolling in currently. "
"13570480","13571420"," Down to 425."
"13584280","13591280"," Also watched a spy call come in February 22nd, 432 C for $51,000."
"13592140","13597740"," I'll post some of this stuff onto the Twitter handle so you can see it. "
"13600160","13602220"," You can see the flow here."
"13606920","13617430"," This is all based on the trade heading into"
"13617430","13618670"," Biden's speech."
"13621750","13625090"," I'll post this to the captain's alpha handle. "
"13626830","13643720"," And you"
"13643720","13646000"," can see the big positions coming out."
"13651550","13653730"," Got nine minutes until the speech begins."
"13668260","13673680"," Home Depot puts February 25th, 315 P, $61,000. "
"13674400","13679320"," Rocket more puts March 18th, 10 P, $23,000."
"13687360","13688760"," Just be careful out there."
"13688760","13695720"," I want to show you guys that just be conscious that the support is turning into resistance here"
"13695720","13696840"," above at 430. "
"13697720","13704660"," If you're bullish here, you want to see a reclamation of turning this resistance into support."
"13705960","13707280"," Just be conscious of that."
"13716510","13720030"," And currently support at 430 is turning into resistance. "
"13734910","13739110"," The flow sentiment has turned to 60% neutral."
"13739950","13747350"," Put to call ratios now, 0.75. We have a put flow of 165,000, 166,000 contracts."
"13748170","13750410"," Call flow 220,000 contracts. "
"13751430","13752670"," So it's mutual at the moment."
"13766040","13766700"," Oh, yes."
"13766940","13769200"," What your voice boyfriend's asking is the room flat to the speech. "
"13769460","13770480"," It's a good time to ask that question."
"13771420","13773220"," So I, right now I'm short."
"13774680","13780200"," I think the trade is probably higher, but I don't like the setup with all these five puts coming"
"13780200","13780400"," in. "
"13780600","13781840"," So I've got some protective puts on."
"13782500","13786600"," If I have to, I'll get some, if I have to switch real quick and get some calls, I'll sell"
"13786600","13787100"," a lot of them."
"13787320","13788380"," I've got some tight stops on them. "
"13790220","13795060"," If we see any kind of movement on the upside, close them out and I'll take a long position."
"13795480","13797800"," But otherwise, I think we can trade down to 425."
"13798620","13799280"," That's me at least. "
"13799840","13800620"," Don't listen to me."
"13800720","13802060"," I just don't like this turning in."
"13802180","13804380"," I like the support turning into resistance here. "
"13806020","13810680"," So let us know in the comments, are you short or long here into the Biden speech?"
"13811380","13813740"," We've had mixed three results with Biden's speeches."
"13814360","13816520"," We've seen them be positive, so don't get me wrong."
"13816740","13820500"," You can see the Biden speech be a positive on the market. "
"13820880","13828960"," We also did just hear that troops are moving in from a Ukraine into, or excuse me, from Russia into"
"13828960","13829440"," Ukraine."
"13831900","13833020"," So let us know in the chat."
"13833220","13833820"," Be like, hey, I'm long. "
"13833980","13834200"," I'm short."
"13834440","13835960"," I'm cashing whatever it is."
"13836360","13838160"," Maybe things going to happen in the speech. "
"13838360","13842520"," We've got five minutes left to place your bets, which way you think we're trading."
"13844100","13848020"," The only trade I've taken today is getting fucked by hood."
"13850860","13851600"," Short, short. "
"13851600","13855400"," I'm just went flat from short, been short for a few hours."
"13855800","13858320"," Has it hit least short, but it was short from way earlier."
"13858700","13861520"," Short sanctions is bare short sanctions we take off. "
"13862120","13864400"," Short, busy, chewy, by deuce, by short."
"13865140","13866380"," So everybody's short right now."
"13866540","13868400"," Everybody's in the wrong side of that trade, I guess. "
"13871660","13873620"," I'm not trading today, shit, range, and fakeouts."
"13873820","13874780"," I agree with that, Jason."
"13876700","13879060"," The trading, this is not the place we're trading. "
"13880840","13886740"," To be honest with any of you out there, you'll see a move."
"13887520","13891340"," I don't know that I think we trade higher to 440 between today and tomorrow."
"13891820","13893240"," Or overall, that's where I think we trade. "
"13893940","13896300"," And then the next short is at 440 or nearby it."
"13897820","13899640"," I don't know what the trigger is for that to happen."
"13907260","13908160"," No, he doesn't. "
"13908400","13914540"," Biden dumps the market, but then he gets these weird fucking, he gets these weird fucking, like the"
"13914540","13920020"," other day, like four o'clock, he had some kind of goofy fucking speech where he outlined for the"
"13920020","13923920"," 20th time, pale line for the 20th time."
"13925280","13931340"," You know, like outlined what Putin can and can't do instead of just saying, fuck, you know,"
"13931920","13934260"," there'll be consequences, which is what I wanted him to say."
"13935680","13939040"," That's just, but that was taken well by the market. "
"13939680","13944480"," I think the market went up until the overnight and then some bad news came out and dumped it again."
"13948750","13951130"," So I've seen his, I've seen some positive come out."
"13951270","13955970"," Come on, this looks bearish where we're at right now, but get some spy puts coming in. "
"13957830","13960070"," February 25th, 420 P."
"13960770","13963310"," Oof, $590,000."
"13964250","13966810"," Spy puts every 25th, 420 P."
"13967510","13969150"," That's even deeper than I thought we'd go."
"13969150","13972750"," $590,000 against the spy. "
"13974130","13978310"," So every 25th, 420 P, $590,000."
"13978890","13981110"," Lots of bets coming in against the spy currently."
"13991410","13992770"," Now, this is good to see. "

"14121260","14123540"," damage they're trying to incur on a country. "
"14124720","14129340"," Let's say you put, think about this in the back of your head, okay, let's say you're like, think"
"14129340","14134640"," about this for a minute, okay, if you're like, okay, we're going to sanction Russia and choke it to"
"14134640","14135420"," death, right?"
"14137400","14138920"," That brings on war."
"14139340","14145060"," I don't know if you know that or not, but that typically leads to a conventional war."
"14145520","14150760"," So some countries it doesn't because they don't have the ability to wage war with you. "
"14150760","14156320"," Like, let's say you do it with Iran or with Korea, that's a different thing, okay?"
"14157440","14161620"," And they'll get support from, like Korea gets support from China, gets support from Russia."

"14163660","14167340"," You can see that they've raised concerns about Canada's plan for digital service tax. "
"14170210","14174650"," But start to think about a nation like Russia that can do something, right, that can project power"
"14175280","14182290"," and start to think about like, are we going to put sanctions on them that would force them into a"
"14182290","14184090"," corner like a wounded dog, right?"
"14184690","14193870"," And if you did that in reality for just being in these two regions, you could force them into a"
"14193870","14197170"," fight, like a conventional war with other nations."
"14197850","14202110"," So just put that thinker cap on for a minute when you start thinking about what sanctions, the"
"14202110","14205590"," impact of sanctions on Russia and what it really means."
"14206070","14210690"," So some of that is used to play, as my point is that it's used to play to the main"
"14210690","14211970"," street voter hat. "
"14212530","14219230"," So if you're just a voter, you're not in the stock market, you're just a voter, then they're going"
"14219230","14222430"," to say things to appease a main street person."
"14223150","14228590"," But in the background, what really happens in the background is that rich people want to get rich"

"15110150","15110970"," or something."
"15111230","15113950"," And then they went up to $0.51 and I sold them."
"15115850","15117410"," And then somewhere in there. "
"15117650","15124550"," And then now I'm sitting, I haven't bought these yet, but I'm looking at $4.33. So now I'm going"
"15124550","15127970"," to probably come off them because they've got, they've gone out of $0.33. I haven't bought, but I'm"
"15127970","15128490"," just going to open."

"15450350","15456610"," You have imposed travel bans and asset freezes on all members of Russian state Duma."
"15457570","15458390"," That's not big enough. "

"15465570","15473070"," capital and financial markets also sanctioning 27 individuals and entities."
"15488560","15491520"," You want to see bigger news than just the individuals."
"15518170","15522030"," The spy just kind of bouncing around here. "
"15522810","15524010"," Looking for sellers above."
"15525410","15535400"," I mean fucking Biden,"
"15535400","15536120"," what is he doing?"
"15571550","15574530"," I don't see anything in here, I don't see anything."
"15588640","15592620"," Yeah, there's like a shelling by far by Russian led militants. "
"15593180","15600810"," I don't know if that means that these just Russians or these, but they're as long as they say"
"15600810","15601170"," militants."
"15601170","15610430"," The White House reporter saying that the Biden press conference switched back to 2PM possibly"
"15610430","15610910"," later."
"15611530","15612390"," Possibly later. "
"15617210","15618550"," Why the fuck are they waiting?"
"15620750","15622510"," I mean, what the fuck, man?"
"15628570","15631910"," I think Trump used to do that shit, but not like that bad."
"15632070","15637370"," I don't think Trump would just come on and say whack shit at market hours, right?"
"15637370","15639570"," He'd say shit at like four o'clock and then come back on it."
"15639910","15641330"," 9.30 and say whack shit. "
"15641430","15642410"," He'd be late to shit too."
"15647840","15649040"," Spy catching a bid."
"15650400","15651400"," Just the weak buyers. "
"15652000","15652880"," This could be short covering."
"15654720","15657000"," Maybe just some short covering waiting for the speech."
"15665240","15667760"," Wouldn't take it as a face ripping rally or anything. "
"15670140","15672100"," Is it really pushed back to 4.15?"
"15677220","15679400"," Has it really been pushed to 4.15?"
"15687690","15690290"," Yeah, exactly, right?"
"15693050","15700390"," It's not good when it's not good when they make the speech at 4.15. It's never good."
"15706010","15708210"," After market hours, usually good news."
"15708450","15710990"," They'll put in market hours just so you guys are all aware. "
"15712370","15714510"," Just to be cristok, usually, not always."
"15715390","15720330"," We saw some good news, but Biden pumped the market at 4.15 or 4 o'clock like a week"
"15720330","15720610"," ago."
"15721310","15724090"," And then we had bad news come in overnight that dropped the market. "
"15725890","15731930"," So they'll give like a good news conference, usually at like 4.15. They'll pump our 4 o'clock."
"15732030","15737870"," They'll pump the markets up into 4 o'clock for the bad news that rolls in afterwards."
"15743620","15745160"," No, just shit right now. "
"15767090","15768270"," No, I don't think you'll..."
"15769930","15770910"," Yeah, it's not good news."
"15771310","15773950"," It probably means that there's more than likely there's..."
"15773950","15778250"," He'll pump the markets as best he can, even if it's just a small pump."
"15779350","15781470"," And then you're going to sell off after hours at some point. "
"15782490","15786890"," Even if it brings the market back to where it was at close today, you won't be able to trade"
"15786890","15787890"," that unless you're in futures."
"15791770","15792290"," Typically."
"15794930","15798190"," So we could see that we could actually see a trade sideways into the bell. "
"15800110","15804750"," Pump higher, maybe, on the speech, and then a continued downward move."
"15842590","15844070"," So I'm like, mmm..."
"15856930","15859130"," Spy said non-sum support here."
"15862210","15863550"," See, we're going to break below it. "
"15875710","15877330"," Got fixed on the move."
"15879310","15887970"," I'm watching more Tesla puts, February 25th, 805P, $746,000."
"15914060","15918220"," Oh, is that $4.30, $4.20, $73?"
"15961010","15981420"," I think that VIX at $30.38 is quite"
"15981420","15983040"," high with no news out there. "
"16008970","16009930"," Yeah, I don't think that..."
"16009930","16013990"," I think the Biden address better is pushed back again to 2PM or beyond, according to the White"
"16013990","16014210"," House."
"16016830","16019050"," And then someone else mentioned 4.15 in the afternoon."
"16021610","16023410"," So volatility party over. "
"16026170","16032470"," US Secretary of Defense, meeting with the Ukraine Foreign Minister in US support for Ukraine's self "

"16060130","16066950"," Some Spy put buyers here, February 22nd, $4.34P, $3,000 and $12,000, trying to get the pressure on"
"16066950","16067190"," at least."
"16069430","16073530"," But I don't know if they can hold the pressure on the year, not going to get volatility from here"
"16073530","16078490"," into the end of the day as of right now, unless there's a speech announced of some kind."
"16079690","16082850"," Looks like more like a pinning action, trying to pin the market into the close. "
"16083790","16085810"," But there should be some movement at some point."
"16091330","16093670"," I don't expect that you'll see short covering at some point."
"16095530","16097750"," I wouldn't want to be short until 4 o'clock. "
"16125030","16127050"," All that volatility to go."
"16127210","16132990"," For the Biden speech and there's no fucking Biden speech."
"16137150","16138790"," All your 4.15 was a joke. "
"16139310","16141290"," Are you saying they're going to have the speech at 2?"
"16141850","16142990"," Here, I'll look it up myself."
"16145360","16147300"," There's no Biden speech at 2 o'clock."
"16149450","16151510"," Let me look up when Biden's going to speak. "
"16159820","16161440"," Let's read and see."
"16169070","16174010"," Oh, it says Biden speech, Biden address from Russia is live at any moment."
"16189470","16192390"," I'm going to look it up on Twitter and see what it's saying on Twitter. "
"16198520","16201240"," I'm going to get a clearer picture of when the speech is."
"16208330","16225490"," So the Biden speech is going to move to 2 p.m. Someone"
"16225490","16230190"," wrote, if Adidas just threatened to stop exporting track suits to Russia, this whole thing could be"
"16230190","16230750"," over in a day."

"16268500","16275910"," Sinceino, let me see if I can look at those 425s again."
"16276710","16278070"," 425s are almost getting cheap again. "
"16280790","16289760"," Let's see if we can get them down to like 40 cents or some like 47 cents right now, if"
"16289760","16292720"," I get them like 40 cents or something, 39, 38 cents."
"16293400","16294760"," I might re-enter them again."
"16297460","16300020"," Looks like the market is just saying, fuck you, we're going to wait. "
"16316440","16323460"," So peak short gammas looks like 4, 3,300 spx and there's been a transition to 425, 4,200 short"

"16347260","16349080"," 2 p.m. or beyond, Jesus."

"18113130","18114410"," I was told that weeks ago."
"18114690","18116350"," Last month, I remember I was told that. "
"18116930","18118210"," We ain't coming back down here again."
"18121830","18124030"," Cap, we ain't ever coming back down here last time."
"18124030","18127450"," I remember me, Kevin, or whoever it was telling it, they bought the dip down here. "
"18129170","18130430"," Right, I don't know, just him."
"18130650","18134870"," I remember a whole bunch of people saying they were buying down here that back in January."
"18135490","18138550"," I remember Tyletown, Joe, Donut. "
"18139430","18141210"," Don't worry, we'll be back here again."

"18154580","18157360"," Let's just say you claimed out there in the social media world."
"18157740","18161160"," Oh, I bought the fucking dip at $7.91. I don't believe you, by the way. "
"18161500","18168560"," You bought it right at $7.91. So 90% of dip buyers on Tesla are fucking probably pretty scared"
"18168560","18173780"," right now because I guarantee that 90% of them didn't buy right at $7.91. Guaranteed."
"18176850","18178390"," Guaranteed didn't have that savviness."
"18178710","18179590"," Not 90% of them. "
"18181720","18186080"," So Tesla now trading down close to $800, which means I'm a shit ton of retail."
"18188040","18191900"," Share buyers are probably upside down currently and been panicking."
"18192180","18193660"," And I don't blame them for panicking either. "

"18217860","18220680"," Not seeing the reaction that you want to see right now on Tesla."
"18223870","18229690"," Now trading down 426.23. On the spy knocking on the door right now. "

"18241050","18242270"," I'm a bull by the way."
"18242270","18243010"," So get me wrong. "
"18243170","18244410"," I'm not trying to be bearish on Tesla."
"18244690","18247390"," I'm just wondering what the word is out there."
"18249290","18252410"," People asking me, you know, is this the last we're going to see down here?"
"18252970","18254610"," It's been going on for months now, right?"
"18254830","18256150"," Two months at least. "
"18257650","18259530"," You know, it was safe for me to buy down here."
"18260450","18263310"," And last time we were down here in Tesla, I told you no."
"18263530","18264530"," We'll be back down here again. "
"18267060","18267520"," I'm worried."
"18267780","18269880"," I don't think I think we hit that 791 last time."
"18269880","18271340"," It was so brief and quick and fast. "
"18272080","18274520"," I don't think any of you could have even bought that dip at that price."
"18274920","18276960"," So I think that I'm going to bet that most of you bought it."
"18277240","18281180"," Let's say called 805, 815, 820, something like that. "
"18281380","18281440"," Maybe."

"18303650","18305410"," They're not up here where we are currently on the spy. "
"18308350","18309570"," They're down below at 425."

"25268310","25269710"," I'm gonna see who said that. "
"25282070","25285430"," Okay, I was thinking that we're not seeing signs of recession or maybe I'll buy back in."

"25349930","25350790"," They just hear those words."

"25357350","25358290"," Shut up, Mero. "
"25364930","25371860"," Yeah, you don't say the R word."
"25372740","25375360"," Even if you say there's no recession, you just don't say it."
"25380390","25382410"," All right, so I'm flat now again. "
"25385990","25386650"," I'm flat."
"25388090","25389450"," I don't like hearing those words."
"25393790","25397050"," Recession, QT, sodomy, raw dog. "
"25398210","25399630"," Not seeing signs of result."
"25400010","25400570"," Okay, thanks, Ergo."
"25401250","25402710"," Still, I don't, what is he doing?"
"25403050","25404050"," Like, you don't even mention the word. "
"25404830","25405710"," You don't even mention it."
"25407770","25408850"," You don't even bring it up."
"25412520","25413760"," Spy closing strong. "
"25417340","25419960"," All right, so we're not hearing anything right now for reporting."
"25425990","25427870"," So I'm going to, I'm going to log off here."
"25428690","25433550"," If I see anything bad on flow, I'll go after I log off. "
"25434190","25435150"," I'll post it."
"25435570","25436290"," Have I seen it before?"
"25436630","25437610"," Four, ten, four, twelve."
"25437770","25443010"," You guys got my thought process on what will happen overnight. "
"25443330","25445410"," Do you think we trade higher overall?"
"25446190","25450350"," Only because of, because of dealer, not dealers, not many puts."
"25451610","25452570"," I don't think it's a big move."
"25453190","25454650"," Unless there's bad news overnight. "
"25454970","25459070"," That's the one thing you're fucking with, right, is with any kind of bad news that comes overnight."
"25459990","25467370"," You've got another seven minutes to either get out of your calls for that quick run or to hold or"
"25467370","25469070"," add into the four, fifteen hour."
"25471570","25474450"," The only thing I would say into tomorrow would be we should trade higher. "
"25474450","25481010"," We should just because you can go down all the time, but the reality is more than likely if we're"
"25481010","25484510"," going to be going down on Thursday or the implication is we're going on Thursday, Friday."
"25485350","25490010"," You don't, you don't dunk the head of the bulls for a day."
"25490130","25491170"," It can be wrong in there, at least overnight. "
"25492530","25494390"," Even if we don't get it today, we should get it tomorrow."
"25494910","25499310"," We could trade down the next three days, but I find it hard to believe that it's just straight down"
"25499310","25501810"," day after day after day after day after day."
"25501810","25504090"," I think that there's a little bit of a pull up. "
"25504530","25509570"," It doesn't mean that it's bullish in any way, shape, or form, but you do pull up at some point."
"25509710","25510970"," There isn't going to be forever."
"25511310","25514530"," We're going straight down for three months straight. "
"25514670","25517390"," That didn't happen in March of 2020."
"25517830","25520050"," It hasn't happened and it didn't happen in 2018."
"25521170","25523310"," It hasn't happened in any other time that I've been trading. "
"25524750","25528950"," So you do see pullbacks because the market always does want to go up."
"25528950","25533390"," You're always going to see more pull ups than you will pull downs."
"25534810","25538210"," The market tends to want to always spring back up at some point. "
"25539710","25546450"," So my projection for tomorrow is flat to up on the open unless we get some really bad news that"
"25546450","25550070"," we don't know on no news, that you will see dealers buying futures."
"25551910","25555290"," There is some, I think that's what I've got for it until tomorrow."

"25579370","25582930"," My overall outlook on the market right now has not changed. "
"25584810","25586030"," That's overall bearish, right?"
"25586030","25588810"," We all know that the look overall is bearish."
"25589030","25593390"," Even if we get a big move up to four, let's say four fifty or four forty."
"25593730","25598090"," Just keep that in mind that when you should be shorting this market are some key numbers. "
"25598210","25602150"," You are looking for four four zero zero, right?"
"25602330","25605030"," To take a short, like a severe short or real short."
"25605490","25606890"," Take a long put position."
"25607730","25609810"," Possibly even as high as four five zero zero. "
"25610410","25611950"," It doesn't matter if it's today or tomorrow."
"25612190","25615610"," If you even if you missed that train, like I missed out, there were just three kick ass"
"25615610","25618050"," opportunities to do that in the past three weeks."
"25618590","25622230"," So we're looking for the next one at this point to take the market short once again. "
"25622990","25624610"," The price targets below right now."
"25624610","25627390"," We're looking for a cash market recheck down below."
"25627590","25629330"," We did get one just today, believe it or not. "
"25629830","25633590"," But there are a lot of bears out there that are saying, no, we want to we want what we"
"25633590","25639370"," had in the futures market recheck down much lower."
"25641090","25643910"," So we had four twenty five sixty eight."
"25644310","25648110"," And they're looking for a recheck of four twenty seventy one. "
"25648390","25649690"," We didn't quite get there today."
"25650730","25652850"," That not that rechecked out of four twenty."
"25653170","25658070"," And we are looking at some some buyers stepping in when that's not buyers. "
"25658390","25665990"," Well, all it is is dealers getting rid of hedging into tomorrow and then and puts their rolling off"
"25665990","25666430"," today."
"25667190","25669010"," And we'll see what happens in the overnight."
"25669390","25671870"," See if the new hedging today impacts tomorrow. "
"25673010","25674450"," But we do want to see a break."
"25674690","25680450"," We talked about this morning where we saw breaks and we were looking for breaks to open the door"
"25680450","25681430"," below four twenty."
"25681590","25686230"," So if you want to look below four twenty, we didn't quite see that in futures. "
"25687070","25688730"," And so we're looking for that."
"25688970","25693850"," We're looking for another break below four twenty for the door to be opened down to four ten four"
"25693850","25694150"," fifteen."
"25694150","25699290"," And then lower numbers of four hundred and three ninety and whatever below. "
"25699450","25700370"," We've still haven't seen that yet."
"25700870","25705710"," Though the door is open to a recheck of four twenty still without a doubt four twenty is on the"
"25705710","25706610"," table to recheck."
