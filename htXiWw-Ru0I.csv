"205480","206800"," Let's go to the trigger screen."
"206800","207020"," Here."
"208660","215280"," So just on the opening bell this morning, I am looking for some kind of a we've got some real"
"215280","216860"," danger here on the open. "
"217140","220780"," This hourly trigger is crossing over the daily trigger right now."
"221040","222720"," Don't want to see that happen."
"223420","226900"," Have a little arrow here to try to buy a dip. "
"227620","234460"," Even buying this dip though, we've got a 30 minute to an hourly trigger max bearish."
"237800","242480"," Even if I buy this dip, I'm really concerned up here with a reversal of the downside."
"243980","244840"," Speak conscience of that. "
"244980","247380"," It's roughly at four four forty four ten."
"248460","255040"," And then you've got another cross happening above here at forty four four five oh one looking for"
"255040","256339"," rejection to the downside."
"257180","264940"," Now if price after the opening bell does not break above here to trade this, you are looking for a"
"264940","271600"," sell to the downside from that four forty four and four forty five oh one to the downside. "
"271600","277420"," If it begins to sell right off the open this morning, we'll take that short to the downside as"
"277420","277680"," well."
"278320","283420"," If that continuation does happen to happen on this opening bell this morning, if we go back and"
"283420","289320"," recheck any of these prior lows, go back here and check that seven fifty two in the morning."
"291520","295620"," Now we did have a big expiration options expiry on Friday. "
"296800","300140"," And what's fascinating about this is we switched over to ES really quick."
"302340","305360"," What's fascinating about this is we did have the break."
"308860","314340"," We did have that nice squeeze higher but dude they sold the fuck out of this. "
"315140","319460"," Had this nice squeeze higher in the overnight got right back down underneath it."
"319560","323920"," I think it was like three thirty in the morning or something on Thursday and that was it."
"324180","329880"," Boom the sell signal came got underneath the half hour get underneath the hourly trigger and from"
"329880","338720"," there it was underneath the"
"338720","342420"," something it shows in a better time frame here. "
"353140","358240"," Squeeze up and over right here blast down underneath get underneath the hourly and then that was it"
"358240","367200"," get underneath this this zone of up and now we're out we're sitting down here on the hourly trigger"
"367200","369820"," this morning it's looking pretty bad here."
"370360","377840"," Now the one thing saying that we are we do have the open right now so we'll just talk about"
"377840","381980"," that this bull plane here this reversal and this bear plane right here I want to draw your"
"381980","387180"," attention to this bear plane right here that is about to happen right here we get another bear"
"387180","395760"," plane and so you just want to be careful of this into today and into tomorrow if there's any kind"
"395760","400660"," of a of a sell above here in this hourly trigger I'm going to a quick second I got a"
"400660","401340"," place to trade hold on."
"407700","414600"," So just take a peak here right if you're looking on a 30 minute chart this is ES they're going"
"414600","419960"," to be looking for some kind of a rejection up here so you've got four five one two four five"
"419960","426760"," zero three this is I think both contracts but up somewhere up in here you're looking for that for"
"426760","433480"," that next leg lower and for the confirmation of a bull plane to the bear plane to the downside"
"433480","439220"," those usually get pretty violent if we get that rejection so we'll see how that works itself out"
"439220","445800"," here end this open see if we can get that blast down we'll look at spy really quick well for"
"445800","454180"," you as well this morning and it's kind of that same deal right kind of see it right here we're"
"455680","460380"," seeing the cross not quite there yet no confirmation of that bear cross I know for all the doom and"
"460380","465300"," gloom this weekend or in Friday that you're thinking that it's bearish but we actually have no"
"465300","470600"," confirmation for that downside move there yet so we'll look to see if the seller step back in here"
"470600","479360"," and begin to sell this stuff down if they do confirm the downside move on spoos the target to the"
"479360","488140"," downside is quite nasty it's way down here at 4.9 54 basically 430 down here so if they get"
"488140","494720"," that rejection up here your target to the downside is going to be that 430 there is some light to"
"494720","500520"," the end of the at the end of the tunnel for this uh we'll take a look at that today"
"500520","505560"," at some point if we do trade that 430 is at the end of the world is the big question"
"505560","511340"," right does that become end of the world for a pull on here uh four spoos end of the year"
"511340","516880"," kind of a thing and we do do we break trend down there at 430 it doesn't show us as"
"516880","524980"," breaking trend right now on the daily uh that bar down there is just at the bottom of trend so"
"524980","530080"," if you're watching daily trend on spoos that's that little green box down there i'll show it to you"
"530080","540080"," break down there uh right down there you know and I do kind of expect that weakness at least into"
"540080","546880"," uh the 19th for where we are you know do we get down here for the fed rate decision on"
"546880","553100"," wednesday and is that the place where we begin to actually break upward trend or begin to go higher"
"553100","558800"," we'll talk about that too because a bunch of stuff mechanics in the background that are on the bull"
"558800","565840"," side still even with this expiration selling that took place on friday uh the bulls still have a"
"565840","570600"," chance believe it or not I know it's crazy to say that but for bears they really want to get"
"570600","577540"," underneath this 430 down here or at least if they tag that 430 that they get a rejection back"
"577540","585120"," underneath it and start heading lower uh for the doom and gloom side of this trade here now we're"
"585120","592120"," going to watch this into the we're going to watch this that's right sorry i'm in a trade right now"
"592120","601660"," i'm in uh 445 c's but even in here let's look at this 30-minute chart here just take a"
"601660","608640"," peek here and keep if you're a seller keep your eyes on selling all of this stuff up here it's"

"631380","637940"," up the daily and the hourly trigger to the outside we'll see if the sellers can't step back in uh"
"637940","644680"," to this upside we do have max bearishness signal on the hourly trigger that tends to say that this"
"644680","650320"," won't hold for sellers that we will squeeze up and above this this hourly trigger at least get the"
"650320","656420"," squeeze up there even if we roll back over but i'll tell you what heading into Wednesday uh friday"
"656420","664160"," not looking good for bulls right um not what bulls want to see and the market is set up to"
"664160","670720"," begin to sell down to that 430 so we'll see what happens this morning if they do get that sell"
"670720","675960"," to the upside i'll keep you um let me see if i can keep it oh let's take it here"

"1268900","1274900"," right i'm not gonna watch this uh so we've got well this week we've got expiration on the 20th"
"1274900","1281580"," we've got the fed funds rate decision on wednesday uh in the afternoon let's take a quick look at"
"1281580","1289640"," the economic calendar so we've got uh for today we've got home builder confidence index at 10 a.m."
"1289940","1295140"," on tuesday we've got housing starts building permits at 8 30 wednesday we've got the fed rate"
"1295140","1302300"," decision everybody waiting for that rate decision on wednesday do i expect much at this point into"
"1302300","1309320"," wednesday not really uh you're gonna get a panning action of course on this we can switch this over"
"1311740","1317140"," for this rate decision but then let's look at some other things too that could propel us up or down"
"1317140","1324260"," after that rate decision we've got claims fully fed manufacturing on thursday and then into the end"
"1324260","1331620"," of quarter we've got major news coming in as well we've got pmi on friday at 9 45 and then"
"1331620","1339860"," next week we've got claims on thursday and then we've got pce on friday the 29th all of this could"
"1339860","1347460"," all of this economic news could result in some fairly decent downside and upside moves in the"
"1347460","1355980"," market depending upon where the fed comes in for uh on their rate decision on wednesday now this"
"1355980","1364840"," rate decision uh i but the thumbnail this morning i put uh i put a question mark on is this"
"1364840","1372320"," a front running of a pause from the fed the ecb uh if you remember from last week uh came"
"1372320","1380260"," out and they're kind of dumbish right that maybe that would be the end of rate increases and"
"1380260","1387920"," truthfully down in here with this rate decision as a bull i would like to see uh at least one"
"1387920","1395780"," more rate hike now i don't know if we get that rate hike and i don't think it's bullish if"
"1395780","1405400"," we don't get that rate hike i hear that closely if we if there's no hike uh on wednesday it's"
"1405400","1412980"," actually kind of bearish in my viewpoint i i'm going to take that as the uh bank's trying to we'll"
"1412980","1421100"," try to front run uh a pause to rate hikes and i i don't want to see that um if"
"1421100","1430140"," we i would prefer to see the 25 bps on on those rate hikes so that the market can continue"
"1430140","1438080"," higher believe it or not um now that could lead to of course downside moves if we get no hike"
"1438080","1446100"," right you might see an initial exuberance from the market but only for liquidity for a downside"
"1446100","1457300"," move uh it would be my take on no hike on on wednesday now uh at 25 bps if"
"1457300","1465080"," we get a hike on wednesday my expectation would be an initial negative reaction right but then"
"1465080","1473340"," actually the market would continue higher it it would put all of these it put to bed or put to"
"1473340","1483120"," rest uh the idea that the market uh is going to pause higher for longer really is what pulls uh"
"1483120","1490260"," need for this market to continue to march higher uh in my viewpoints now there i did look at the"
"1490260","1497820"," fed fund 30 day rate on i think i think i have it here i'm sitting and bringing up here"
"1502720","1508120"," yeah i'm not i'm not seeing it here i don't have it here in the background but what i want"
"1508120","1515120"," to show you was that the fed the fed 30 day rate is down at the june uh oh six"
"1515120","1522940"," levels uh which would lend lend the argument that the market could go up uh for a period of time"
"1522940","1529700"," for for a significant period time for a major role uh so i'm fascinated to see let me know in"
"1529700","1533780"," the chat what you think if we get a rate hike or not or maybe you're in disagreement with that"
"1533780","1538840"," if you think that we start pausing the market starts to race higher and that all the doom and gloom"
"1538840","1545140"," is over but uh i i i don't want to see that that no rate hike the more that we"
"1545140","1552660"," begin to signal the pause in rate hikes the more risk i think there is two bulls for that last"
"1552660","1560820"," role to the downside uh that that checking a low uh in the marketplace 384 000 something like that"
"1560820","1566940"," uh i think the longer that they continue to threaten and you believe that they're not done with"
"1566940","1571300"," their rate hikes uh that you're going to get the market to go higher and just keep keep running"
"1571300","1575500"," higher and running higher until they fill those who have done their job now there's some other"
"1575500","1583420"," mechanics at play uh on this that are worrisome not worrisome right now but uh oil and gas oh well"
"1583420","1589640"," not gas but oil specifically can go higher and the market can go higher uh with oil and gas believe"
"1589640","1595880"," it or not uh if they continue to raise rates the market can go up higher believe it or not"
"1595880","1601780"," i know you don't want to hear that but uh that's true uh but it the other the other idea"
"1601780","1606820"," behind this is if they continue to raise rates does the oil begin to roll uh with those rate"
"1606820","1615400"," increases you got zero bps you're saying there's no rate hike coming for the market do you disagree"
"1616260","1622740"," i'm fascinated to find out if you think that um we don't i want to know i guess from you"
"1622740","1631880"," if you think if rates pause um if rates pause let's say we pause rates right and that you"
"1631880","1638620"," anticipate rate cuts do you think that that in turn will get front run into a major downside move"
"1638620","1644960"," in the market uh or not that's the bigger question i think uh sorry for my voice this morning i"

"22370270","22379970"," squeezing off its low from open last week now squeezing our price target on arm is 5823"
"22379970","22388890"," 5823 on arm usually a little bit lower you've got arm now heading higher looking to trade that 5823"
"22388890","22397590"," and hopefully that target of 60 bucks to the upside arm on the move right now you want to take"
"22397590","22402970"," a snapshot of that for yourself to keep it at home the one thing I would say about arm would"
"22402970","22408430"," be be careful as we go into after hours it's gonna get really weird man every time we're gonna have"
"22408430","22414050"," to hours on these new on these new tickers they get IPO'd it's always like it's always a freak show"
"22414050","22422130"," to pay attention in the after hours while trading this two upside targets my one upside target 5823"
"22422130","22453180"," and in truth I'm not bullish on arm unless we're above $60 and 53 cents see if"
"22453180","22483000"," they can dump this shit into the bell bears my throat's"
"22483000","22491480"," fucking burning me up right now I throw it's all fucked up right now it ain't pretty blissa wits"

"22582760","22592270"," at take a look at at HYG in a 15"
"22592270","22601570"," minute there's a giant fucking gap to giant a gap above to $75 some"
"22601570","22610970"," gaps to close on the downside it's weird HYG has like a gap to close"
"22610970","22620670"," to 7452 and they've got a giant gap above I might want to buy that close with some calls"
"22620670","22628970"," I'm not gonna lie look at that dude look at the gap on the five minute dude"
"22628970","22636230"," there's like a tiny gap on the five minute down below and then there's a fucking huge gap to the"
"22636230","22645070"," upside just like squeeze the fuck out of these bears like into tomorrow's open like I'll be honest"
"22645070","22652350"," like I'll be honest they're like some not zero dates but one dates that are zero dates tomorrow you"
"22652350","22663130"," like the spidey senses you get Dixie rolling over in the after hours tonight Vix 14"
"22663130","22672270"," 11 right now there's a little room here for a squeeze on bears I don't know I mean you know"
"22672270","22678450"," the one thing I would say on this would be you can't trade futures you may not want to take"
"22678450","22686890"," that trade so let's look at that really quick so on the weevil chart here there"
"22686890","22694350"," is a trade for bulls I just don't know if you get out before the market sells down on you"
"22694350","22702830"," tomorrow so if you're a cash market you might not have this trade you might not be able to take"
"22702830","22709870"," this trade where it goes too high against you like goes up here you're all who pooping it up in"
"22709870","22715850"," the overnight hours and then boom they sell it down on you before you ever get there right so just"
"22715850","22721770"," be careful of that and it's tomorrow the idea would be that we actually trade higher into tomorrow"
"22721770","22727750"," but then by the time you get here you're right here and there's no buyers right so yeah you went"
"22727750","22732930"," up and there's no buyers showing up to buy it up and you kind of get fucked in here and"
"22732930","22737270"," this could happen at 4 a.m. 2 a.m. this could happen at 9 p.m. like there's all"
"22737270","22745570"," kinds of time frames it's more about where the sellers are than time so there might be a trade for"
"22745570","22753530"," you in futures let me take a look at the trigger screen here we're gonna switch over to ES into"
"22753530","22763360"," this close and if you're looking for a place to sell futures"
"22763360","22773200"," you're kind of looking for that kind of a role"
"22773200","22781320"," right there 450925 something like that now you might be able to trade this up into after hours but"
"22781320","22793390"," dude I'd be looking to sell the fuck out of that I would be looking to sell it I would"
"22793390","22813310"," be looking to sell that so we'll see still not bear Sean futures at least kind of a"
"22813310","22818890"," big breakdown here that's needed you really need like you need the market to get underneath this"
"22818890","22828550"," level get those bears all fired up so you can start sending it I'll keep an eye on it"
"22828550","22833090"," if they give me a tease in the 4 p.m. I might buy some calls well I'll stick around"
"22833090","22844780"," here with you till 4 15 minutes left into the close yeah I"
"22844780","22853620"," mean I I'm looking at it more from the like at 4 15 or 4 o'clock there could be"
"22853620","22861220"," a dip buy for bulls and cash market the dip buy is probably better for bears or excuse me the"
"22861220","22869960"," device probably better for Globex futures traders and not for cash market traders but I've had this"
"22869960","22875460"," happen like you pick it right you pick the way that you're going and then because of where we are"
"22875460","22881240"," no one's willing to buy on the open tomorrow right everybody's paranoid you're like the only person"
