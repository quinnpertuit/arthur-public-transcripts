"30490","32230"," before the film begins."
"144540","152700"," I had a phone call I'd take to get right into it. "
"154520","156180"," It ain't said over here."
"157680","158620"," Good morning, everybody."
"158780","159280"," How y'all doing?"
"161960","163740"," I gotta put the triggers over, don't I?"
"165680","166880"," Give me a second here. "
"167720","168500"," I want to..."
"171460","172700"," slap some ads in there."
"175040","175680"," I mean, look at them."
"175920","177080"," I mean, I got a few things I gotta do here. "
"179500","182260"," We've got the Senate hearing starting in eight minutes."
"182600","184840"," They'll likely be a hedge on the market."
"188360","190860"," Austin and Millie defense budget. "
"191160","192460"," We don't want the defense budget."
"194260","197000"," Silicon Valley Bank upcoming."
"197660","199160"," I think that's the one we're looking for. "
"202100","203380"," Was what happened here."
"203800","208240"," This has led to a lot of scrutiny of other similarly positioned banks."
"208240","216280"," Silicon Valley is in a more unique position because a lot of their loans were technology companies,"
"216520","218780"," and the tech industry has really suffered during this kind of..."
"219240","220560"," You know, let's talk..."
"220560","223960"," We've got a few things to talk about this morning. "
"224640","226980"," They're loans aren't going to get paid back because they're not able to recapitalize."
"227200","229680"," Give me a second here."
"230460","231880"," Stop talking, talking heads. "
"232020","237560"," I gotta speed this up, make sure we're real-time."
"242880","246520"," Okay, we're real-time now with Washington Post's coverage."
"246520","248560"," They took over SDBR Friday. "
"248900","251160"," They kind of basically put it in receivership."
"252220","258360"," You know, I do want you to realize that we have something to talk about this morning about the"
"258360","261240"," banks, but just crystal clear as day."
"264640","270580"," When these banks are formed, you know, ended up talking to you even in Washington. "
"271020","271880"," Good morning, by the way."
"274700","277100"," Let me get rid of some of this stuff here in the background."
"278440","280240"," You get a bunch of stuff I gotta do. "
"282240","286380"," Put the live stream up."
"287500","291760"," We're going to be at the end today and we break down what that is."
"292120","295000"," And how is that going to be essential to the discussion we're going to hear today?"
"296280","301320"," Yeah, this is actually a pretty good American invention, and it started around the time of the"
"301320","302000"," Great Depression. "
"302360","309120"," And the idea, of course, was to give Americans, particularly working-class people, the notion and"
"309120","310400"," the trust."
"310720","312340"," Good morning."
"313300","314260"," I think I got everything here. "
"314260","316340"," No, no, no, that's not right."
"317040","318220"," What's going on here?"
"318480","319400"," Oh, dude."
"319660","322260"," The limit is $250,000. "
"326120","331140"," You can have multiple accounts, or for richer people, what they often do is- Close."
"331680","335800"," Turn off shot cut."
"338810","342830"," And the government, in the case of a bank failure, like what we just saw. "
"345020","346900"," Technical stuff I gotta do in the background here."
"347460","351720"," That's a pretty sweet guarantee for any of us in the United States."
"351720","358520"," The question, of course, is what happens if for those people or businesses that have more than $250 "
"358520","360440",",000 in the bank?"
"360820","361820"," There's the live stream. "
"362300","367060"," As James was pointing out, a lot of what are known as uninsured deposits."
"367700","373920"," To give a concrete example, the billionaire Peter Thiel had $50 million sitting in this bank."
"376140","377460"," All right, there's the chat. "
"377680","378720"," I can see your chats now."
"378740","379400"," Good morning, everybody."
"379560","381780"," How are y'all doing?"
"382420","383740"," Everybody's doing well. "
"383740","390290"," I hopped into the discord this morning."
"390370","391810"," I was in the discord last night."
"392350","393570"," Discord this morning. "
"394010","394410"," Phone calls."
"394790","397010"," You're a billionaire."
"397330","400570"," We are going to back all that money. "
"402010","403970"," Okay, so there is a number one."
"403990","405510"," There'll be a hedge on the market today."
"405770","406670"," You have to know that, okay?"
"406790","409350"," There's a pretty big hedge on the market trying to keep it down today. "
"409510","411930"," This has to do with the Senate hearing that's coming up on banking."
"412570","419910"," We also have the Fed President coming out on Wednesday for some kind of a Republican luncheon of"
"419910","420370"," some kind."
"420750","425250"," So you've got Fed Chair Powell tomorrow. "
"428010","430110"," Anyway, we'll take a look at that Fed."
"431590","433530"," I got some stuff for us."
"433610","439070"," But the key point here is that we've got the Fed begging Senate hearing this morning. "
"439530","441850"," This doesn't mean it."
"442030","443550"," This hearing doesn't mean anything."
"443930","444150"," This is. "
"447550","456810"," This is like, I won't give you how you label this, but this is meant for talking points for your"
"456810","461230"," constituents, for election cycles and seasons."
"461890","463570"," It means truly means nothing."
"465030","471770"," You know, banks don't really have systematic risk unless there's a bank run. "
"471770","481770"," When there's bank contagion, it is when people remove deposits from banks"
"481770","483290"," other than that."
"483490","487870"," They don't typically carry that much risk in how they're set up."
"488570","493710"," So as a baseline, banks only have real, not ever. "
"493950","495330"," There is fraud risk, of course."
"495510","497010"," We know that banks sometimes commit fraud."
"497470","498690"," They do wonky stuff. "
"498690","502910"," But basically, if they're following the rules of the law and hot their charters, how they're set"
"502910","505070"," up, there isn't much bank risk."
"505890","511169"," Even their treasury bills at some point or whatever they take, whatever they have out there to"
"511169","516830"," cover the risk that they have with loans that they provide services that they provide stuff like"
"516830","517030"," that."
"517270","518809"," Eventually, they're going to pay, right?"
"518970","519450"," We all know that. "
"519590","525830"," When we have a run on a bank that no one can control that, including the bankers, the Senate, the"
"525830","527250"," Fed, the treasury department."
"527250","537070"," So whenever consumer or user sentiment is panicky, is their"
"537070","539670"," true systemic risk to the banking system?"
"540050","544490"," That's a key point to understand here with these Senate hearings."
"545850","555350"," And the other key point as this unfolds over time would be that the reaction from the Senate"
"555350","565090"," or lawmakers or possibly what could take place inside of the House of Representatives would be"
"565090","569270"," too much of a hammer coming down on these banks. "
"569270","574590"," We know that there needs to be banks that are going to provide liquidity for startups."
"575530","577410"," And sometimes you'll actually get, you know, it's weird."
"577550","581650"," I was talking to, I was talking on a show a week or two ago about the Senate, and I"
"581650","587410"," was saying when these hearings start, the real hearings begin, you'll hear rhetoric. "
"588150","594990"," But what really matters is how much of a hammer actually comes down on these banks and how, in"
"594990","604770"," truth, a lot of these small regional VC driven banks probably had more maneuverability"
"604770","614650"," than larger prime banks in managing risk because of how"
"614650","621090"," low they have, how little they were hedged, right?"
"621930","630450"," I think Jay Powell even alluded to this inside of Jay Powell even alluded to this inside of his Fed"
"630450","637710"," funds rate speech that he had the other day, which I tend to agree with his take on it the"
"637710","638230"," other day."
"638990","642990"," I was that there was more maneuverability for these regional banks."
"646410","649870"," So we're going to take a look here at, well, okay, we're going to take a look at this real"
"649870","650130"," quick. "
"657690","659550"," Looking really squeezy here."
"663510","665890"," This is the monthly trigger here."
"670950","675490"," The people on the committee, I know I'll probably be listening to Elizabeth Warren, who has kind of"
"675490","677810"," been among the most vocal on this issue. "
"678410","680350"," The hourly has now gone up."
"680490","683370"," The populist right, J.D. Vance, who saw a speak at the railroad."
"683650","684930"," Any 592. "
"685590","688070"," I suspect Tim Scott, who you mentioned, who wants to work for president."
"688650","691750"," They don't have an interest to be seen as carrying water for Wall Street."
"691950","694530"," They're going to be tough on the government and on the banks. "
"694970","697510"," And so I think you could have this conference where it's way up here."
"697510","700650"," The populist right in the populist left, Jared Brown, Elizabeth Warren coming hard."
"701370","702830"," They bring some of these up here. "
"702970","707090"," Sort of a perspective of not representing Wall Street, but Main Street."
"708130","711670"," And we're seeing the chair there, Jared Brown, he's seated."
"712430","716510"," I got to look at a few excerpts of his opening statement that were likely here shortly. "
"717730","718330"," He's 16."
"719210","722450"," He's really going to be talking to the American people and saying we get why you might be upset"
"722450","726450"," about the government failing these banks out."
"727670","731670"," And I am fascinating at what these hearings have to say today. "
"732410","742130"," Because we are at this place in the market where the Fed chair knows that whatever is said in these"
"742130","742550"," hearings."
"742970","744950"," The big guy, the big powerful interests."
"745690","754710"," And this is an opportunity for him to be 96.21. I'm going to be fascinated to see how he"
"754710","758210"," sort of threads that needle because it's obviously his party, his administration. "
"758650","761130"," But how aggressive is he?"
"761630","766110"," Out of the witnesses, is there one that you think is really going to give a mind share of some"
"766110","766790"," of the tough questions?"
"767250","774470"," Yeah, I think FDIC, Michael Barr, the vice chair of the Fed for supervision, he's doing an internal"
"774470","776730"," review that's supposed to come back pretty soon."
"776730","779210"," To basically look at what went wrong, lessons learned."
"779510","782170"," So I suspect he'll get asked about lessons learned. "
"782890","784450"," You'll get my report when it's ready."
"785070","789950"," But Martin Grunberg from the FDIC, what kind of warring signs were missed?"
"790190","791330"," Why wasn't more action taken?"
"792010","795910"," It's also possible that Michael Barr from the Fed sort of throws the San Francisco."
"796150","797330"," You can see this big big. "
"798290","801430"," Remember yesterday we talked about do they slip us under?"
"802950","807910"," Remember yesterday it said do they'll try to possibly sell this down to the close?"
"808490","814370"," And then in a low liquidity environment try to slip underneath the hourly trigger, the daily"
"814370","814790"," trigger."
"814970","816970"," They can't get it done in cash market."
"817570","819630"," And they're doing it this morning, right?"
"819810","821550"," They try to open us up underneath here. "
"822430","824450"," They can't do this in cash market."
"824650","825270"," Sellers can't."
"828550","830310"," We're starting up here right now. "
"830310","836510"," The full lever short on S&P 500 is insane, right?"
"836650","841470"," It's been like this for some time down in history in the following days."
"841730","843990"," Like full lever short on S&P 500."
"844930","846890"," And then of course, you know, it's weird. "
"847170","848230"," The indexes are straight."
"848490","848810"," Not weird."
"849390","859230"," We've seen this in previously, but you'll see the stock market's actually trading a lot like almost"
"859230","862990"," the investments of executives and shareholders. "
"863550","870830"," A magnified basket where your long tech long tech sell you, right?"
"870950","874130"," You've got a basket of a long and high risk stuff."
"874310","876030"," I'm long and high protection stuff."
"876290","878750"," And then I'm slim in the S&P 500. "
"880170","881450"," You see the queues go up."
"881530","884210"," You see Southside on IWM."
"885030","891830"," Not past couple days, but generally speaking, selling down sectors of the S&P 500. "
"892490","895250"," And then full lever short on S&P 500."
"899230","900290"," Very unusual."
"901350","903770"," And of course, no price follow through as well. "
"904410","905470"," Starting to squeeze here."
"905470","909850"," As workers feared, they would pay the price for others bad decisions."
"910590","915370"," We're left with many questions and justified anger toward banking sectors and boards, toward"
"915370","919550"," venture capitalists, toward federal and state bank regulators, toward policy makers. "
"920810","924450"," The scene of the crime does not start with the regulators before us."
"924850","931150"," Instead, we must look inside the bank at the bank CEOs, at the Trump era banking regulators, who"
"931150","935450"," made it their mission, again, to give Wall Street everything it wanted."
"936350","941850"," Monday morning, quarterbacking aimed only at the actions of regulators this month, is as convenient"
"941850","947150"," as it is misplaced, coming from those who never met a Wall Street wish list. "
"947830","948630"," They didn't want to grant."
"949650","954110"," Many who are the first to scold the regulators for their failures offer ready ears."
"954110","960390"," Whenever bank CEOs line up at their offices, complaining about out of control bank examiners. "
"960710","965410"," Remember, some of those complaints that are hearing with Fed Chair Powell over the Fed, merely"
"965410","970130"," reviewing capital, just three days before Silicon Valley Bank failed."
"970810","972670"," How soon we choose to forget."
"973330","977950"," When we ask who should have known how the risk for building in these banks, we should start at the"
"977950","979170"," source with the executives. "
"979170","983630"," Silicon Valley Bank almost quadrupled in size over three years."
"983850","986310"," Signature Bank more than doubled in that time."
"986390","988790"," Now, I do have some issues with these banks for not. "
"988970","993290"," The bank should be prudently managed, should be mindful of the scope of risk they face."
"993490","996210"," That I do have issues with these banks for not doing."
"996590","1001430"," The committee must consider how these banks exploded in size in a way that was clearly"
"1001430","1001730"," unsustainable. "
"1002470","1008370"," Some explanations will focus on complicated sounding concepts, like balance sheet, balance risk and"
"1008370","1010570"," moral hazard and stress test and liquidity set."
"1010970","1011610"," Liquidity ratios."
"1012790","1015310"," Really though, it comes down to more basic concepts. "
"1015850","1018110"," Hubris entitlement greed."
"1018730","1023730"," Always, always, always with big pay days at the end for the executives at the top."
"1024310","1028990"," The CEO's own pay was tied directly to the growth of SVB. "
"1029490","1032970"," At SVB, executive bonuses were pegged to return on equity."
"1032970","1037730"," They took more risk by buying assets with higher yields to make higher profits."
"1038630","1041410"," When those investments started to lose money, they didn't back down. "
"1041790","1047270"," It won't surprise anyone that Silicon Valley Bank went nearly a year without a chief risk officer."
"1048130","1052850"," The venture capitalists fueled the bank's growth by forcing the companies they invested in and"
"1052850","1055430"," advised to keep their money at Silicon Bank."
"1056250","1061870"," Those same VCs turned around and sparked the bank run by telling the companies to pull their money"
"1061870","1062070"," out. "
"1062070","1063790"," Yeah, that was bullshit too."
"1065110","1067930"," Signature bank found itself in the middle of the same bank."
"1068150","1074030"," There are a lot of things to be said here, but the VCs and their banks did. "
"1074670","1079090"," It's all just a variation of the same theme."
"1079310","1082010"," The same root cause of most of our economic problems."
"1082390","1088030"," Wealthy elites do anything to make a quick profit and pocket their rewards and when their risky"
"1088030","1092030"," behavior leads to catastrophic failures, they turn to the government. "
"1092250","1093050"," They turn to the government."
"1093590","1094830"," I mean, some of this is legitimate."
"1094830","1098730"," Working workers and taxpayers to pay the price in too often workers do. "
"1099370","1102330"," Even though no taxpayer money is being used to save these."
"1102470","1102830"," That's bullshit."
"1102830","1105170"," I understand why Americans are angry. "
"1105430","1105930"," That's a lie."
"1106750","1110970"," Quickly, government mobilized when a bunch of elites in California were demanding it."
"1111430","1113430"," The taxpayer money is not being used. "
"1113590","1116550"," Problems get taken more seriously than others in this town."
"1116550","1120150"," Of course, we have to prevent systemic threats to the economy."
"1120770","1126070"," But corporate trade deals are a systemic threat to towns like I grew up in in Mansfield, Ohio and"
"1126070","1127270"," across the industrial Midwest. "
"1127730","1130170"," Sounds like I grew up in in Mansfield, Ohio."
"1131270","1134990"," I'm one of the regular people over investments in innovation and workers."
"1135610","1136910"," And those threats are not only tolerated. "
"1138010","1140110"," They've been actively pushed by the same crowd."
"1140630","1141450"," I'm one of the pause."
"1141450","1144090"," The government to save them. "
"1145570","1152970"," Starting to squeeze up above 396.07.08. There are no libertarians in the Silicon Valley."
"1153150","1154390"," These fucking politicians."
"1154910","1157170"," Now on those who have no problem with government intervention. "
"1157390","1158050"," Keep on squeezing."
"1159150","1161130"," We'll think a little bit harder."
"1161830","1165210"," This full-levered short is not going to work out for these. "
"1165390","1167170"," This south side had funds."
"1167710","1169130"," I don't know how it does."
"1169130","1171010"," We don't need new rules. "
"1171630","1176870"," The only thing that I see with this is you're not getting what you want."
"1176990","1177650"," It's going to squeeze."
"1178070","1179230"," Why we need strong rules. "
"1179430","1184950"," When it does finally squeeze, the resolution is typically really high to the upside."
"1186110","1187050"," Historically, at least."
"1187490","1192190"," The official sitting board before us today know that their predecessors rolled back protections"
"1192190","1193830"," like capital liquidity standards. "
"1193830","1197430"," Stressed tests, brokered deposit limits, and even basic supervision."
"1197770","1202210"," They green-lighted those banks to grow and grow and grow too big, too fast."
"1202790","1205810"," There are important questions about deposit insurance we must consider. "
"1206390","1211570"," Whether the current amount works for everyone, including small businesses, whose real goal is to"
"1211570","1212010"," meet payer."
"1212570","1214530"," I'm going to interrupt here for just a minute."
"1214750","1217570"," So just back in this original topic here. "
"1222270","1227330"," You're seeing this full-levered gunlock."
"1228370","1231290"," It was gunlock was on CNBC yesterday."
"1232090","1235570"," And he's basically like panhandling CNBC. "
"1237450","1242470"," I mean, I love the guy's smart investor and all this, but he's basically panhandling on CNBC."
"1242950","1251330"," Who gets a half an hour segment on CNBC to, what is it?"
"1251730","1253250"," They're not bag packers."
"1253630","1257490"," Like beg the fed to pay for the bonds that they bought. "
"1258250","1259170"," You know, the Bond King?"
"1260110","1262590"," To be able to say, hey, we bought all these bonds."
"1263830","1264410"," I'm full of me."
"1264990","1271110"," It would be like a retail trader saying, hey, I bought the dip on TLT and expect them to print"
"1271110","1272450"," at least one time this year. "
"1273410","1274730"," I'm forcing you."
"1275610","1277350"," I'm screaming on CNBC."
"1278270","1283750"," Does the retail trader get to say, well, I bought, I've been accumulating TLT since January 1 on"
"1283750","1286790"," every low and I expected to double at some point this year. "
"1287510","1288590"," Basically what's being said."
"1291470","1300690"," And what's funny about this is what's funny about this to me is that yesterday on Fentuit, somebody"
"1300690","1304250"," posted the Fed Financial Stress Index."
"1305630","1310790"," And I made a comment a week or two ago on Fentuit where I said, I said, boy, this price"
"1310790","1315970"," action, I said this price action that I see in tech. "
"1317390","1325510"," In this price action that I see in the spy, I've only seen when we're near a bottom in the"
"1325510","1331250"," stock market in a crash, believe it or not."
"1331250","1335450"," In the bottom, rounding around the bottom, you see the front running of tech."
"1336790","1346890"," You see the, the, the, the legs being cut out from commodities like oil, XLF, stuff"
"1346890","1347430"," like that. "
"1348010","1357190"," And you'll see like face, rip and rallies and S and P 500 pinned due to the legs being cut"
"1357190","1358430"," off of some of these sub sectors."
"1359990","1363630"," And how they typically resolve themselves is spiral squeeze."
"1364530","1371910"," At some point to match up to the, the, the higher moves in tech. "
"1373130","1376490"," And I think I gave a date as well."
"1376690","1380950"," I was like, I think this reminds me of like mid March or something of 2020."
"1380950","1384850"," Last time I've seen this, I posted this on Fentuit two or three weeks ago. "
"1386990","1391230"," And someone posted on Fentuit yesterday, I think it was a cheddar flow or someone."
"1392990","1398370"," Posted a chart saying, Hey, if you looked at the, the, the Fed financial stress index."
"1399870","1404250"," And so I did look at it yesterday and I was like, well, I was like, let's look under the"
"1404250","1405190"," microscope at this. "
"1405770","1410810"," So I look, instead of looking over the course of five years or 10 years or 20 years."
"1410810","1418170"," I looked over the course of two weeks to a month where we are right now."
"1418490","1426790"," And then two, three weeks to a month in previous cycles where the Fed financial stress index was on"
"1426790","1428770"," a high and shocker. "
"1429790","1435770"," Last time was on a high like this was near the bottom of the last."
"1436470","1440750"," Every example was right towards the bottom of a stock market crash."
"1441870","1446590"," So I'm going to assume on that note, number one is that the Fed is aware of this. "
"1449150","1457990"," This also highlights the systemic risk to a moment of where you have to trade it up, but then there"
"1457990","1459390"," could be a crash at any moment."
"1459390","1464110"," We plunge 300 points, 200, 300 points."
"1464110","1464730"," I don't know 500. "
"1465030","1466190"," You can say whatever fuck you want."
"1466290","1466730"," You can claim."
"1467210","1470510"," I always like this because I'm always like price matters here. "
"1471170","1474130"," Are we getting a plunge to 1600 or 1400?"
"1474970","1477930"," Or are we renegotiating what that plunge is?"
"1478530","1479550"," It's always like it's 20%."
"1480130","1480490"," Okay."
"1481410","1482630"," No, no, no, no. "
"1482630","1483690"," Now it's 30%."
"1483690","1484350"," And I'm like, okay."
"1484450","1484570"," Okay. "
"1484770","1485890"," How short are you short?"
"1486570","1488590"," Are you sure for 20% or 30% are you short?"
"1488590","1489250"," Are you short?"
"1489530","1489850"," 20%."
"1489850","1491110"," Now they're up 10%."
"1491110","1492290"," We have to be 30% down. "
"1492950","1496930"," So I'm assuming that there's some kind of monetary reason in the background why you're now claiming"
"1496930","1497650"," 30%."
"1497650","1502990"," And what is that 20% 30% is it 20% 30% at 420?"
"1503870","1505690"," Is it 30% from 400?"
"1506150","1507270"," Is it 30% from 345?"
"1508870","1510010"," Where is it 30% from?"
"1510950","1511850"," Is it 50%?"
"1512670","1514370"," You know, I think a fucking auction or something."
"1515330","1517530"," And price doesn't seem to matter, right?"
"1517530","1519470"," It's always doom and gloom. "
"1521470","1525910"," And it was fucking doom at 340 and it's fucking doom at 420."
"1526810","1528670"," And it's always 30% or 20%."
"1529190","1529830"," It's 20%. "
"1529830","1530630"," 30%."
"1530630","1532390"," It's 30% we're down at 340."
"1533390","1537050"," It's 30% we're up at fucking 420 or something like that. "
"1537210","1538170"," It's always fucking doom."
"1539010","1541050"," And you can never get a firm price out of anybody."
"1542390","1543910"," And then you're like, well, fuck it. "
"1543910","1546610"," If we do, let's say it's 30% from 420."
"1547890","1554230"," Are you telling me that I should have, I guess I should have bought the fucking 34550 or the 3450"
"1554230","1557210"," back in October."
"1558170","1561470"," I could have wrote all that shit up and then came back down and bought again. "
"1563950","1566430"," So I do find it slightly comical."
"1567250","1570310"," Because then you're like, okay, or are we going to 1400?"
"1570990","1571570"," Are we going to 1600?"
"1572270","1574630"," You tell me we're going down 70% now."
"1574910","1577250"," You know, it just, it just becomes absurdist. "
"1578150","1579790"," At some point it's absurdist."
"1582700","1585300"," So I'm assuming that they're aware of this."
"1585580","1591860"," Now the one here in the, the only here in the ointment that I come up with here is that"
"1591860","1592640"," they're aware of this. "
"1593700","1596940"," And it is going to matter what's set inside of these baking hearings."
"1597920","1600400"," It is going to matter the lunch and tomorrow."
"1601820","1604260"," And, you know, like where do we go from there?"
"1605680","1607960"," We're still in a sideways trading range. "
"1608180","1610140"," If we go down 30%."
"1613140","1614740"," I'll put this back on here."
"1614820","1615940"," I'm going to bring something up for you. "
"1621480","1622660"," Hold on a second here."
"1637820","1639000"," Hold on one second here."
"1640420","1641860"," We got something to bring up for you. "
"1641980","1644720"," Let me bring up the talking head again for you."
"1644720","1647340"," Let's say an unsound practices."
"1648040","1650300"," Recent reports confirm what we already know. "
"1650840","1655700"," Your priorities and your work with the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Bailey,"
"1656340","1663540"," centered on climate change, an issue wholly unrelated to the Federal Reserve's dual mandate and"
"1663540","1664320"," role as supervisor."
"1664660","1673300"," Given SVB's social and climate agenda, one must ask if SVB's investments in climate cause the"
"1673300","1676960"," regulators to be a bit more permissive of its risks."
"1678440","1686900"," If you can't stay on mission and enforce the laws as they already are on the books, how can you"
"1686900","1691440"," ask Congress for more authority with a straight face?"
"1692420","1698660"," To that end, I hope to learn how the Federal Reserve could know about such risky practices for more"
"1698660","1703980"," than a year and fail to take definitive corrective action. "
"1704680","1711040"," By all accounts, our regulators appear to have been asleep at the wheel."
"1712380","1715540"," In addition, our regulators were asleep at the wheel."
"1717020","1718820"," So it's the same thing, right?"
"1719080","1721260"," So let's look at SVB. "
"1721260","1730740"," Here's our low, this is SPX low down here, $34.92. They're claiming that our bears are claiming"
"1730740","1734080"," that we have systemic risk down at $2,800 down here."
"1735360","1738640"," This is another, I guess, this would be another 600 points lower."
"1738820","1743280"," That would be like the depths of hell, $2,800 down here. "
"1744060","1749600"," But if you had bought like this $34,000, $34,000, this is $34.91, and you'd bought somewhere down"
"1749600","1754060"," here at $2,800 and five years or so, it's not going to mean much."
"1755000","1759480"," You'd be a genius to have bought this and to have bought this down here."
"1759820","1763220"," Even if this is the worst that they're claiming, right?"
"1763460","1765700"," So remember, it was 20%. "
"1765700","1770380"," And now, then a couple weeks ago, we're at $4.20, so it has to be 30%."
"1770980","1774920"," Now, you kind of have to stick with the program, right?"
"1775380","1781600"," If we go up here to $4.60, there'll be claims that we're going to sell off 40 or 50%."
"1781600","1782160"," Does that make sense?"
"1782640","1783780"," So it's always like doom and gloom. "
"1784500","1790920"," When in reality, you should have bought this bottom, and you should have bought this bottom"
"1790920","1794880"," deployed 10%, 30% of money here."
"1795700","1798320"," Add another 10%, 20%, 30% here."
"1798580","1803300"," And if there's any kind of other doom, another 10%, 20%, 30%, and then have 10%, 15% cash, and"
"1803300","1804800"," be building cash all along the way. "
"1805360","1807980"," So in five, 10 years, you've bought these bottoms."
"1808280","1816800"," Meanwhile, you're being told, you're guaranteed to go here, which we haven't yet."
"1819740","1822640"," There's no guarantee we go here, because they haven't been there yet. "
"1822680","1830320"," Even if we were down here, you'd be better off, or you'd be better off probability-wise to at least"
"1830320","1831840"," put some skin in the game here."
"1832800","1833800"," Like they did."
"1834260","1838780"," You'd be better off with putting some skin in the game down here. "
"1839120","1844520"," Even if we hit $2,800, even if we blast down here and hit $2,800."
"1845900","1851580"," And you're probably more than likely going to be told, if we hit $3,200, you're probably going to"
"1851580","1854920"," be told, you'll have Mike Wilson say, not so bad."
"1855800","1858900"," If we go to $2,800, you might say, oh, you know what, maybe we'll go to $1,400 or"
"1858900","1859260"," $1,600. "
"1859980","1862380"," So it's always like a maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe."
"1864020","1869180"," When you as a market participant should have been buying down here, here and here, in five years,"
"1869380","1872300"," 10 years later, you would have been, you'd look like a rock star."
"1872300","1878460"," You're literally a rock star hitting all these, and you're kind of covering all your bases trying"
"1878460","1879340"," to buy these dips. "
"1880720","1887120"," This is that once in a lifetime opportunity to get some great exposure."
"1888500","1893480"," If you buy the S&P 500, I'm not talking about individual tickers, but you buy the S&P 500"
"1893480","1895040"," at 349."
"1896580","1901100"," You buy it again at $2,800 or $3,200 somewhere in there. "
"1901100","1905020"," You're now in for, what, $3,300 or something, or $3,100."
"1905740","1908320"," And then you buy it one more time down at $2,800."
"1909360","1910440"," You're a rock star. "
"1910760","1916120"," You're all a famer buying this stock market for generational wealth."
"1916440","1917340"," That's what you are."
"1917540","1922520"," Unless you're saying we're going to $1,400, $1,600, $1,600, like a Mike Barry or something, and lo"
"1922520","1925640"," and behold, you've got another 10 or 15% of cash on you. "
"1925640","1931720"," You've been accumulating that 15% for two, three years, and you slam that down at $1,400."
"1932680","1934040"," You've now beat everybody."
"1934400","1936520"," You beat the banks at that point. "
"1937620","1947620"," And while you're doing all this, you've got panic sellers, you've got doom sellers saying, Hey,"
"1948060","1949660"," look at the Fed Financial Stress Index."
"1949900","1954940"," We could have like a brief moment of screaming down three, four hundred points in here."
"1955100","1956020"," It could be really horrible. "
"1956220","1960300"," Just wake up tomorrow, and we're down two, three hundred points tomorrow."
"1961060","1965840"," And I'm like, okay, so we scream down here tomorrow."
"1966820","1969720"," My assumption is going to be I can deploy some cash down there. "
"1969860","1972020"," Two and about a month later, we're going to be right back up here."
"1972600","1974060"," Looking like a rock star again."
"1974820","1977860"," Looking like a fucking rock star buying this down here. "
"1979900","1982980"," You know, put a ratio spread on here at the same time."
"1983480","1985840"," So I'm long from down here."
"1986160","1988560"," I put a ratio spread on. "
"1988900","1991080"," If we go up, it pays for itself."
"1991900","1993860"," If it goes down, I get purr."
"1994940","1999880"," If I have more cash to buy a bottom down here, I'm a rock star. "
"1999880","2001260"," I'm just rock starring it up."
"2001500","2003980"," So I just don't know where I lose here."
"2005060","2006880"," I just don't know where I lose here. "
"2007520","2009020"," I don't know why there's so much panic."
"2009280","2011180"," We already know there's risk here."
"2011300","2018660"," You don't tell me on fin to it 16 million times that there might be like some systemic risk down"
"2018660","2019000"," here. "
"2020320","2022080"," So I just kind of like scratching my head."
"2022320","2023360"," And I realize that it's there."
"2024360","2029600"," And like somehow you're going to laugh at a bowl for saying, yeah, I bought this down here. "
"2029600","2031400"," And I'm going to buy this down here."
"2031400","2034600"," And I got a little bit of a hedge on in case we do this."
"2034660","2037020"," This looks like a rational market participant. "
"2037900","2041780"," Not like, you know, some fucking sell side."
"2042000","2043840"," That's telling you don't buy this."
"2044060","2044880"," Don't buy this. "
"2045560","2047760"," Oh, and it's going to do it another time down here."
"2047760","2055000"," And you got some like guy out there or some like sub seller like, I didn't buy this and I"
"2055000","2055820"," didn't buy this."
"2055980","2061699"," I sold all this down here and also I tagged this bottom perfectly. "
"2062139","2066219"," You know that they're going to come out and say that to you some kind of nonsense, right?"
"2066620","2067620"," You know it's a lie."
"2069159","2070500"," You know it's a lie."
"2071800","2073920"," And I can show you how it's a lie. "
"2075780","2083139"," We generally hit bottom on May 5th, May 19th, basically bottom May 19th."
"2083980","2085920"," You should have bought May 19th."
"2086600","2089260"," You should have bought June 16th. "
"2089840","2093880"," You should have bought October 13th."
"2094500","2097200"," You should have bought December 29th."
"2097760","2099960"," You should have bought March 10th. "
"2100660","2104040"," Can you imagine who got blown the fuck out on January one?"
"2104600","2109440"," Like once you remember we were going in a January one and it was we're getting a market crash."
"2109820","2111100"," It's going to be fucked, right?"
"2111340","2112600"," And that's not what happened, right?"
"2113020","2114400"," Came in a January one."
"2114620","2118160"," Remember when we were told that the holiday rally is over?"
"2118960","2123560"," Remember it was like a fuck your holiday rally and now we're going to crash. "
"2124120","2124820"," That didn't happen."
"2125000","2125280"," Did it?"
"2125280","2127880"," As a matter of fact, right in here."
"2128880","2131920"," Is where bears got bent over. "
"2133320","2134840"," Bent over."
"2134840","2138380"," We're now on March 28th."
"2138760","2142280"," You're talking people out there with millions in shorts. "
"2143460","2145000"," Millions and millions."
"2145460","2145960"," Southside."
"2146240","2146360"," Millions. "
"2146900","2147860"," I'm talking millions."
"2148280","2151400"," 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 million dollars."
"2151740","2155980"," And I bet today right now this morning heading into the 31st. "
"2157520","2161000"," That if I'm short, this market 20 million, 30 million dollars."
"2161080","2163640"," That's short, but I got a bunch of fucking SPX puts."
"2165940","2167940"," For 20, 30 million dollars. "
"2168440","2170080"," And now they're worth like 10 grand."
"2171580","2173040"," There's some hassle out there."
"2173160","2179640"," It's like you're telling me there's a chance we can crash it by the 31st 200, 300 points. "
"2180380","2182480"," And I'm at least going to get my 20, 30 million back."
"2182760","2184040"," That's what they're doing more than likely."
"2184040","2184920"," I shit you not. "
"2185380","2186500"," I shit you not."
"2186620","2190040"," There's someone out there that's just lost a million dollars."
"2191060","2195420"," Five million dollars, 10 million dollars, 20 million dollars. "
"2195600","2199920"," That's like you're telling me there's a chance before the 31st that these SPX puts my print."
"2201080","2205800"," Do whatever you can do to make the market crash 300 points in the next three days."
"2206220","2206700"," Literally. "
"2207340","2210000"," I know that the people out there are thinking that."
"2210560","2214400"," I know there are people out there probably thinking that on April 1st."
"2214540","2218720"," We're going to crash 200 points so that so that they just get slapped in the face because they put"
"2218720","2220400"," that heads on for an entire quarter. "
"2221040","2222260"," And right in here."
"2225140","2227940"," It's right in here for an entire quarter."
"2228940","2233640"," They got told fuck you know, you're not getting a crash. "
"2234800","2239680"," And you listen to that bear mongering for three months."
"2240540","2248960"," If you look at the NDX, if you look at NDX, it's even uglier."
"2252320","2258260"," It's even uglier to keep the system safe and sound. "
"2259460","2262480"," At the same time, the events of the last few weeks."
"2262980","2264160"," Look at it right here."
"2264340","2266140"," What more can be done in what?"
"2266300","2267120"," December, right?"
"2267400","2269100"," We're going to write it in January and look what they did. "
"2269340","2270060"," Rip face."
"2271420","2277640"," And now they're down here and you've got three days left and they're just like please, please,"
"2277640","2279820"," please sell before the 31st."
"2280920","2282380"," So that's what you're hearing out there. "
"2282540","2283800"," When you're hearing people saying."
"2284680","2287280"," Where it's systemic risk for a crash."
"2287900","2290780"," They want it to crash like the next three days. "
"2293440","2295140"," They want their puts to print."
"2295780","2297300"," They've waited three months for it."
"2297620","2300620"," They can taste it like it's just sitting there. "
"2300880","2303800"," It's just sitting there like like foaming at the mouth."
"2304300","2313220"," I bought bonds and I'm still short and I've got SPX and Q puts that are three months old and"
"2313220","2315620"," I want to print before the 31st."
"2316060","2317460"," So I'm going to go on to CNBC. "
"2319760","2323580"," I'm going to go on to CNBC and I'm going to cry for my money."
"2323900","2329020"," I'm going to go on to I'm going to go to my bank and I'm going to remove all my"
"2329020","2329200"," money."
"2329200","2336020"," I'm going to rug pull a regional bank and see what can I do to crash this market so that"
"2336020","2336780"," I stay rich. "
"2337000","2337960"," I get my golden parachute."
"2339300","2342180"," If I have to do that, I'll do that even with a regional bank."
"2342180","2343760"," I'll try to do a rug pull. "
"2344200","2345140"," That's NDLS."
"2346180","2347060"," Not NDX."
"2347840","2350980"," We're also focusing on whether the Federal Reserve supervision was appropriate. "
"2351520","2354680"," But you can see it right here back in just that way man on the wrong day there."
"2355160","2358440"," While the Federal Reserve's framework focuses on threshold."
"2359180","2360760"," You can see it right here. "
"2361800","2365780"," We're right here and they want this drop down and they're not getting it right back here in"
"2365780","2366060"," December."
"2366660","2368860"," That's October right here December, that's December 9."
"2369400","2371720"," I get the wrong dates there right here."
"2373900","2374840"," Look at it. "
"2375220","2375960"," Didn't get it."
"2376640","2382180"," It's not good enough to say 20%, it has to be 30%, 40%, whatever they can claim."
"2383460","2385540"," It's like, you know, just give me something. "
"2385820","2386700"," Save some of my money."
"2386860","2389420"," It just hasn't happened."
"2390880","2393020"," It just hasn't happened for bears. "
"2398860","2400080"," This hasn't happened."
"2400400","2401400"," That's all you're hearing."
"2401860","2403600"," And you can see the full lever right now. "
"2404300","2404980"," You can see it."
"2405100","2407180"," This is rage from sell side hedge funds."
"2407800","2410580"," This is rage from gun lock and all these other people. "
"2410920","2412180"," And they're just like, we're going to sell."
"2412940","2413540"," We're going to sell."
"2414220","2414740"," We're going to hedge. "
"2415780","2416720"," We want our crash."
"2417200","2418440"," We want bonds to pay."
"2418900","2420480"," That's literally what you're seeing here. "
"2420860","2423000"," In addition, recent events have shown a lot of money."
"2423000","2424660"," They own the market, right?"
"2424800","2428460"," In light of changing technology and emerging risk."
"2429640","2431200"," So, I mean, what do you do here?"
"2431400","2439100"," The only thing that you can do when this resolves typically it's the SP5, I will squeeze like rip"
"2439100","2442020"," faces off when this resolves. "
"2442620","2446880"," So all you can do, if you're a retail trader, all you can do is my point here."
"2446880","2453880"," Ultimately is all you can do is buy dips."
"2455140","2457280"," Whenever there's a dip, you buy it. "
"2458000","2461140"," If we trade down a 345, we trade down a 3,200."
"2461480","2462720"," We trade down a 3,600."
"2464660","2466280"," We trade down a 2,800. "
"2467380","2467640"," You buy."
"2468820","2469440"," That's what you do."
"2469580","2469980"," You just buy. "
"2471480","2472180"," You buy the market."
"2472780","2476900"," You stop listening to all this crazy nonsense out there."
"2478900","2480580"," Like pure craziness. "
"2482840","2484180"," About doom and gloom."
"2485760","2489860"," Your probably be do best to just set an alert."
"2490660","2492280"," Set an alert at 3,600. "
"2492780","2493840"," Set an alert at 3,200."
"2494380","2495380"," Set an alert at 2,800."
"2496760","2498920"," And if we're ever down there again, you just buy. "
"2498920","2502580"," You just buy some and you add to your position."
"2503460","2505280"," If we trade up to 4,200."
"2505680","2506120"," 4,300. "
"2507100","2507580"," 4,600."
"2509040","2510180"," You buy a hedge."
"2510860","2511220"," They're cheap. "
"2512480","2513740"," Most of them are free."
"2514940","2520660"," Wasn't a phone yesterday with someone that said, he said, he said, I feel better shorting."
"2521340","2522580"," And I was like, that's insane. "
"2524020","2528380"," Where we are right now, all you need is a ratio spread."
"2528380","2529300"," That's all you need."
"2530180","2531900"," You put a ratio spread on. "
"2532280","2535460"," If we go up and slam into 420, it pays for itself."
"2535700","2536000"," It's free."
"2538380","2542420"," If we go up to 440, it pays for itself, and it's free. "
"2542820","2545340"," You put three months on it, six months, nine months."
"2546780","2547060"," It's free."
"2551200","2552020"," It's insane. "
"2552900","2554360"," And it protects you if we crash."
"2554360","2559860"," So if you wake up tomorrow, you're making your burr printing."
"2560420","2569780"," If you're long the market, if you're long the S&P 500 and you have that crash, two things happen. "
"2571560","2573480"," You're covered with a hedge."
"2574240","2579940"," So your burr printing, you're just DCAing the S&P 500."
"2580840","2586620"," And the crazy part is in those moments, especially, I haven't harped on this too much recently, but"
"2586620","2596260"," especially right now, like today, if we have that moment of weakness in the market, it's like a"
"2596260","2602580"," 70% chance that it's going to be for like a week or a month, or a month and a"
"2602580","2602840"," half. "
"2603200","2607040"," It will be right back here at 4,000 or pretty close to it."
"2608180","2612340"," By month three, highly likely we're at 4,000 again."
"2612920","2620460"," So even in this moment here, even in this moment where we are in the market, like today, if you"
"2620460","2625060"," didn't even have a hedge, and you were like, I just own like, I own a shit ton of the"
"2625060","2625320"," spy. "
"2625980","2630160"," And it's a shit ton of a, I don't know, of whatever, apple."
"2630480","2635600"," I saw one guy and spent 20 yesterday, he's like, you'll never see apple at 160 again."
"2636360","2639480"," I was like, they didn't buy it at 160 fucking dope. "
"2639920","2641960"," It was like you fucking moron."
"2642240","2644480"," I was like, they bought it at 120 and 130."
"2645240","2646860"," They bought it down there. "
"2649020","2651780"," They weren't buying 160 and 170."
"2652280","2656880"," Bulls, buyers, market participants aren't buying the fucking spy at 165."
"2658520","2660020"," It's funny, he said it wasn't going to 160. "
"2660580","2662740"," It tagged 165, like a week later."
"2663280","2665300"," I'm like fucking wrong again."
"2666460","2669540"," So I'm like, I don't know what to say to these people. "
"2669920","2676120"," Like, if you're a bull and you bought apple at 120 and we crashed today right now, next five"
"2676120","2680020"," minutes, we go down, you're probably going to see apple bounce around 120."
"2682720","2685020"," Probably somewhere in there, right around 120."
"2685960","2688700"," So, and what if it goes to $90?"
"2689580","2691060"," He said something too, yes. "
"2691300","2695400"," He didn't say yesterday, he had been posting this for like three months and he's like, it'll be at"
"2695400","2695760"," $90."
"2696480","2699960"," If you want to buy it there, you can and I'm like, they fucking will buy it there."
"2700780","2703480"," I'm like, they'll DCA 120, they'll DCA $90. "
"2704380","2706880"," And they're going to come back in 10 years and be stoked."
"2707740","2708420"," They're going to be happy."
"2709100","2710520"," You know, they're going to not listen to you. "
"2712080","2713180"," And that's what they're going to do."
"2713600","2714500"," They're going to buy the dip."
"2714680","2715460"," They're going to buy the dip. "
"2715600","2716380"," They're going to buy the dip."
"2716380","2723080"," And if you're a market participant, if you know what happens every decade or two, you will as well."
"2723740","2724480"," You'll buy the dip. "
"2727220","2732940"," That's the point that I have on all of the doom that's out there for you."
"2733260","2741500"," I want you to realize that when you read that stuff from these permabares or these collapsed bears"
"2741500","2745300"," or any of that kind of nonsense that you see, there's mechanics in the background."
"2745300","2749360"," You've got the mechanics of people that were short since fucking January 1."
"2750420","2752800"," We're trading 394 right now. "
"2753840","2759400"," And they were talking about the crash of January 1."
"2760340","2762680"," Now we're in March 28."
"2763900","2764780"," And we're trading 400."
"2765180","2767500"," We're trading 420 a week or two ago, right?"
"2770280","2777700"," And they were screaming then in March or in December 1st or the coming market crash. "
"2777920","2778480"," 420."
"2778880","2781020"," They're screaming about the coming market crash."
"2782300","2788780"," When you're only responsibility as a market participant, especially as a retail trader, you know,"
"2788880","2792020"," there's like some of you out there that are like, hey, I trade better as a bear, right?"
"2792780","2793960"," I understand respect that. "
"2794100","2799000"," If you're a trader that trades better as a bear, but I got news for you."
"2799820","2802820"," The majority of retailers are bulls."
"2804560","2810720"," The majority, like the super majority of market participants are bulls. "
"2811500","2813120"," They like to buy dips."
"2813860","2814920"," That's what they do."
"2815440","2817820"," They've been doing it since the beginning of the stock market. "
"2818200","2820580"," And this is the majority of people out there."
"2821380","2826240"," So you might operate well on sell side, but the majority of people don't."
"2826300","2827220"," They like to buy a dip. "
"2827920","2833220"," And so if you're out there and you're a bull and you're getting depressed or you're getting scared"
"2833220","2837480"," or some of this stuff impacts you, it shouldn't."
"2838660","2844800"," It should be just another chance for you to make generational wealth."
"2845900","2849760"," It's another chance for you if we trade down there to buy. "
"2850240","2851840"," It's another opportunity for you."
"2851940","2854800"," If you long this market to hedge it for free."
"2856080","2860220"," It's another opportunity for you to buy a dip. "
"2860220","2862560"," And to know that it's going to bounce."
"2864520","2871500"," You understand what I'm saying to you out there."
"2871600","2873080"," You don't understand that as a bull. "
"2873900","2878600"," So all that fear and doom that spread is kind of shocking to me."
"2878880","2881900"," You know, especially on fin to it."
"2881960","2883740"," I'm just kind of scratching my head here. "
"2888000","2890960"," The market reaction to that was quite negative."
"2891660","2893020"," There is no violently sideways."
"2893020","2894860"," I was just someone just asked in chat. "
"2895180","2896240"," There is no fucking violently."
"2896700","2898120"," There is no fucking sideways."
"2898820","2904260"," We fucking went to 345 in October and you were told to buy it. "
"2904800","2907200"," So if you bought it, we're not sideways."
"2908080","2911700"," You're up 50 points on the S&P 500 today."
"2913180","2914540"," There is no sideways. "
"2915140","2917140"," If you bought the dips, you're up."
"2917920","2919720"," There is no violently sideways."
"2920600","2921340"," You're selling puts. "
"2921580","2922280"," You're selling calls."
"2923100","2923860"," And you're making bang."
"2926660","2931500"," Like this whole arguments on I said, if it's fin to it in the news. "
"2931680","2933280"," You got the bond buyers."
"2933680","2934580"," Well, I bought the dip."
"2934740","2935480"," So I should get paid. "
"2935820","2937260"," Yeah, you'll get paid likely this year."
"2937260","2942380"," You buy like bottoms of TLT."
"2942540","2944060"," I'm sure you'll get paid once this year. "
"2944300","2946660"," You have a high likelihood of getting paid once this year."
"2947180","2948960"," But it's insane."
"2949520","2950320"," You come back in five. "
"2950480","2954080"," You come back in three years and you look at this market, you're going to say I should have bought"
"2954080","2954900"," that shit down there."
"2956900","2959300"," I should have bought a hundred pack of spy."
"2961020","2964320"," And I should have sold some calls and puts against it for the last three years. "
"2964320","2968760"," Given the unprecedented scale of the bank run, that's what you should do."
"2970300","2972760"," That is how you make money in the stock market."
"2972960","2975920"," That's how you exponentially grow wealth. "
"2977800","2978920"," That is how you do it."
"2980660","2982240"," That was our central concern."
"2982700","2983720"," That is how you do it. "
"2983900","2984960"," There's no other way about it."
"2991700","2993480"," The rest of it's all noise."
"2994940","2996960"," The rest of it's all fucking noise. "
"2997880","3004740"," If you buy a six month or a three month out hedge in this market right here at 400, you"
"3004740","3007040"," are going to trade outside of a range."
"3008300","3010280"," Look at SPX really quick."
"3012520","3013160"," One more time. "
"3013340","3014020"," What if we go sideways?"
"3014540","3016020"," It was a question."
"3016380","3016940"," It's a fair point."
"3017240","3019200"," You're saying the action's taken where the league is. "
"3019200","3027080"," When we trade sideways, we already know within statistics"
"3027080","3036800"," using statistics that if we have a sideways market, we are going, if we're range bound,"
"3037160","3038280"," right?"
"3038720","3045300"," You're going to have moments of trading outside of that range on the downside and on the upside."
"3045300","3047860"," How long are we trading this?"
"3047860","3049060"," There's two things."
"3049780","3050500"," Two things. "
"3050760","3056300"," If we're sideways from a sideways market, we'll trade outside of a range, right?"
"3056500","3057920"," We have a spread here, right?"
"3058020","3061740"," We've got a bell curve and we stay within that range most of the time."
"3062220","3065060"," We have moments where we trade out of that range briefly."
"3065920","3066900"," That's up and down. "
"3067500","3074820"," Another thing that we know is that as time passes, our stock market, on average, I looked it up"
"3074820","3078920"," last night because I posted it last night and I said, I'm going to go, we're kind of fucking due"
"3078920","3079780"," for a face ripper."
"3080000","3088000"," I said, we're due for a face ripper and I looked it up last night and sure enough, they said,"
"3088280","3094360"," every three years on average, no matter what is going on out there, we have a bull run."
"3094780","3097000"," I mean like all time high bull run every three years. "
"3098100","3098920"," By year three."
"3098920","3105000"," We started this, this silent bear market and believe it or not, December of 2020."
"3105800","3107480"," So we have December 2020, right?"
"3107620","3108380"," We got, we got 2021. "
"3109440","3110220"," We got 2022."
"3111400","3112600"," We're now in 2023."
"3113560","3118900"," So statistically speaking, we should hit all time highs this year at some point by December. "
"3119980","3122780"," Statistically, we should at some point this year hit all time highs."
"3123980","3126800"," That means going all the fuck back there, right?"
"3126800","3131500"," All in fact, back to 2021 in the spy and hit it."
"3132800","3138080"," Statistically, it's on your side and people on fintuate last night said, well, they can't happen"
"3138080","3141480"," without unless there's something we don't, or they didn't even say something we don't know. "
"3141600","3143940"," They just said that can't happen in current conditions."
"3144540","3145540"," And I'm like, oh, it can."
"3146840","3150800"," Anything, anything can happen that could make this market go to the moon. "
"3151680","3154680"," All kinds of events could happen to make this market go to the moon."
"3154680","3155960"," Some kind of shift anything."
"3156320","3158300"," There's an election could happen. "
"3158500","3161220"," There's all kinds of stuff that could happen to make this happen."
"3161740","3168320"," So in all the doom and gloom are in right now, you're like sitting here with this cloud over your"
"3168320","3168580"," head."
"3169260","3173420"," And let's say we hit a bottom and we go to all time highs all in one year, even by"
"3173420","3174460"," mid 2024. "
"3175620","3180460"," Meanwhile, you're just like taking a can down the street with a storm cloud over your head and you"
"3180460","3181280"," just missed it."
"3184900","3188960"," And I was saying this to yesterday because I had already looked at."
"3189380","3193300"," I looked at the VIX divided by the by the SPX. "
"3193820","3198960"," And I was like, man, I'm looking at every time that they get the sell side gets run the fuck"
"3198960","3199880"," over at some point."
"3200620","3202360"," And so I got this was like a month or two ago."
"3202460","3203780"," I was like going through it. "
"3203780","3206240"," I'm like, I can see right here where sell side got run over."
"3207280","3212500"," Like straight run over like I'm selling, I'm selling, I'm selling, right."
"3212500","3214600"," Selling, I'm selling, I'm selling. "
"3215900","3218160"," And they get their faces ripped off."
"3218360","3222720"," Not only do they get their faces ripped off prime banks get their faces ripped off."
"3222880","3228240"," If you read that book hedge fund market wizards. "
"3230380","3238400"," They'll even tell you that size volume doesn't come to the market until the ass end of getting run"
"3238400","3238720"," over."
"3238720","3244860"," The banks typically come in like if you look at when the banks actually entered the 2020 the 2020"
"3244860","3246600"," market, they came in like September."
"3247680","3252960"," In size like they came in the ass and the entire time they were saying fuck. "
"3253140","3253500"," No, fuck."
"3253500","3254040"," No, fuck."
"3254180","3254980"," No, fuck. "
"3255180","3257300"," No, we're not going all time highs."
"3258560","3261380"," And then the and then that the ass and they jumped in."
"3261380","3266480"," So you're going to hear them tell you no here, no here, no here, no here. "
"3266480","3269500"," Whenever it happens, whether it's this year or next, I don't know."
"3270260","3272580"," But they're going to tell you know the entire way up."
"3275880","3278160"," That's what they're going to tell you is they're getting run over. "
"3281760","3283380"," Like straight run over."
"3285120","3288360"," And so you're only job as a bull down here as you buy in these dips."
"3288580","3289080"," That's what it is. "
"3289300","3291180"," Your job down here is buy dip by dip."
"3291500","3294920"," You know, this isn't sideways right now as you bought down here, is it?"
"3295400","3296920"," It's a pretty good profit right here."
"3297580","3298660"," Pretty fucking good. "
"3298840","3300860"," That's October to March."
"3300860","3301960"," That's five months."
"3302840","3303880"," You're a professional. "
"3304840","3306480"," You're like a rock star."
"3306740","3310300"," You're like, you're better than Warren Buffett if you bought October."
"3310900","3314600"," You're better than Warren Buffett if you bought this back in June. "
"3315360","3316500"," You're a rock star."
"3317680","3318860"," You're a rock star."
"3319040","3320180"," Pat yourself in the back. "
"3321320","3323660"," You put your money to work."
"3324700","3325680"," You did great."
"3326420","3332540"," If you bought down here at 3600 and you took it all the way up to 4300, you're a rock"
"3332540","3332860"," star. "
"3333880","3339140"," If you bought Tesla when it slapped $95, you took it all the way up to 200."
"3339940","3340960"," You're a rock star."
"3343480","3350000"," If you bought the initial bank crash, I think about three or four of those stocks. "
"3350260","3351140"," Only one of them didn't print."
"3351400","3354680"," In matter of fact, it printed later, but I sold out of all four."
"3355260","3356460"," Dude, that trade was insane. "
"3357260","3358880"," You bought the first bank crash."
"3359280","3360060"," You're a rock star."
"3360300","3362000"," Rock star, rock star, rock star. "
"3362400","3363460"," You're just a rock star."
"3365380","3368160"," And so for the supply, it should be the same thing for you."
"3368280","3371440"," The SPX, the queues, whatever that is. "
"3371860","3373960"," Do I think that Nvidia is going straight up to the moon?"
"3374280","3376280"," No, but I think they're going to buy the dips every time."
"3376400","3378480"," Every time it sells off, they're going to buy it."
"3378480","3379940"," They're going to fucking buy it. "
"3380040","3381500"," Thank you."
"3381700","3385480"," We're running through this new cycle over here."
"3386740","3392060"," So I guess if you're a bull out there and you're getting down on yourself, I see bulls out there"
"3392060","3397500"," on Fintuit getting all scared and hurt and fearful and all that kind of stuff. "
"3397740","3399980"," I think that's why we're looking at them trying to sell it down."
"3400360","3402900"," This is range, sell side rage right here."
"3403160","3404840"," An orderly bidding process. "
"3405040","3406480"," Sell side rage and a month."
"3407160","3408760"," And a quarter."
"3413900","3414960"," Sell side rage. "
"3414960","3417460"," Get a little bit of a bear flag forming here on the one minute."
"3417600","3420400"," A nice little bear flag right here."
"3420480","3421140"," We're going to barrel play. "
"3421300","3421940"," We know what those are."
"3423860","3424980"," Sell side rage."
"3425380","3430200"," They're going to try to sell the market on JPOW tomorrow at his luncheon. "
"3430620","3433260"," They're going to try to sell the market on JPOW tomorrow at his luncheon."
"3433260","3436420"," They're going to try to sell the market for the Senate hearing."
"3437760","3442560"," The fact that they can't get underneath this stuff and cash market over here. "
"3442660","3446660"," They can't get underneath this stuff and cash market."
"3446840","3450960"," They're going to try to do it when they're not in cash market because they can't get it done."
"3452780","3454100"," Can't get it done. "
"3460300","3461860"," Can't get it done."
"3462420","3463840"," Have to scam it."
"3464400","3465680"," There's no other way. "
"3466640","3469460"," There's literally no other way to get it down there."
"3470460","3478140"," I very much appreciate Vice Chairman Barr taking on this unenviable task of sorting this out."
"3479950","3480950"," Because I've got real questions. "
"3481250","3485270"," Was this a regulatory and bank management failure?"
"3486770","3487870"," Or was it a..."
"3487870","3489270"," No other way to get it done."
"3490230","3491630"," We'll move this over here a little bit."
"3491630","3498750"," If it was a statutory failure and an additional test or activity was needed. "
"3499390","3501050"," I'm all for putting it in place."
"3502050","3508590"," But my operating premise at this point is if this had been not a $200 billion bank, but a $5"
"3508590","3515750"," billion bank, that management's mistakes, not having a risk officer or other items."
"3515750","3521310"," And failure, basic prudential regulation should have caught this. "
"3521510","3523610"," We had two chief regulators, a state regulator."
"3524650","3525390"," That is some point Mr. Brown."
"3525390","3528050"," Missy, I'm going to do one thing for a buddy of mine. "
"3528290","3529730"," And obviously the San Francisco Fed."
"3530550","3535370"," So I'm going to be very interested in making sure we get to the bottom of this."
"3536050","3539450"," I think some of the things you've already pointed out, Vice Chair Barr, is that the bank's"
"3539450","3544830"," business, concentrating in one industry and industry that I used to be part of. "
"3544830","3550670"," But the fact that there was such high concentration of counterparty risk, my understanding 10"
"3550670","3554370"," depositors alone had about $13 billion of deposits."
"3555570","3559730"," Again, it seemed to me interest rate mismanagement is banking 101."
"3561150","3564550"," And again, even at a $5 billion bank, this should have been called out. "
"3565350","3571470"," I also think the speed, I've often cited the fact that the largest bank failure we've seen was"
"3571470","3572630"," walnut back in the crisis."
"3572630","3574230"," We just want a quick second here."
"3574310","3575970"," We just want to let that bank over a 10 day period. "
"3577250","3586190"," In this case, $42 billion, the equivalent of $0.25 on every deposit went out in six hours."
"3586490","3591870"," I'm not sure at that point what regulatory structure could have prevented that."
"3593130","3599930"," And at least from reports, it seems to me that, and I say this is somebody who used to be"
"3599930","3606210"," in the VC industry, some of the very VCs who banked for a long time at SVD may have started"
"3606210","3613050"," this run and demanded all of their ancillary companies all go out at once. "
"3614050","3619850"," So, Vice Chairman Barr, can you take us through with a little more detail, starting Wednesday night"
"3619850","3624770"," through Friday afternoon, how this happened, how we got here, and what you've seen so far."
"3626290","3627770"," Thank you very much, Senator."
"3627770","3633330"," I'll start where you did, which is this is a textbook case of bank mismanagement. "
"3634050","3639370"," The risk the bank faced interest rate risk and liquidity risk, those are bread and butter banking"
"3639370","3639990"," issues."
"3641010","3643850"," The firm was quite aware of those issues."
"3644030","3648870"," They've been told by regulators, investors were talking about problems with interest rate and"
"3648870","3652830"," liquidity risk publicly, and they didn't take the action necessary. "
"3652830","3658630"," They were quite vulnerable to risk, to shocks, and they didn't take the actions necessary to meet"
"3658630","3658930"," that."
"3659550","3666870"," What happened on Wednesday night is they belatedly attempted to improve their liquidity position,"
"3667310","3672650"," and they did it in a way that spooked investors, that spooked depositors, that spooked the market."
"3674090","3679930"," Nonetheless, on Thursday morning, things appeared calm according to the bank's report to"
"3679930","3680310"," supervisors. "
"3680310","3689370"," But later Thursday afternoon, deposit outflows started, and by Thursday evening, we learned that"
"3689370","3694490"," more than $42 billion as you indicated had rushed out of the bank."
"3695170","3698030"," That's an extraordinary pace and scale."
"3698830","3706790"," Federal Reserve bank staff worked with the bank through the afternoon evening and overnight to try"
"3706790","3712590"," and find enough collateral that the Federal Reserve could continue to discount window lending"
"3712590","3713070"," against. "
"3714090","3721230"," On Friday morning, it appeared that it might be possible to meet the outflow that was expected the"
"3721230","3721690"," day before."
"3722570","3729050"," But that morning, the bank let us know that they expected the outflow to be vastly larger based on"
"3729050","3733270"," client requests and what was in the queue, a total of $100 billion."
"3736030","3739610"," I'm home alone right now, so I went to make coffee this morning. "
"3741050","3747650"," Instead of making coffee, instead of putting in a coffee mug, I'm going to take a French press,"
"3747870","3754090"," like a huge French press, and I just poured a gallon of it into one of my kid's plastic cups,"
"3754350","3756470"," like this big-ass plastic cup."
"3758670","3759990"," I'm such an animal."
"3761770","3765850"," You leave a guy like me alone, and I turn into a caveman. "
"3767690","3770190"," Even my dogs, so my dogs are with me?"
"3772270","3774210"," My dogs are like..."
"3774930","3779750"," Normally, they're happy, fun, go-lucky, cuddlin' playin'."
"3779750","3783630"," As soon as all the women leave, they're like savage beasts."
"3786810","3789110"," They're like break-out steak for me, too. "
"3789970","3791010"," They're like the girls left."
"3791530","3793510"," You should just feed a steak along with you."
"3794630","3795730"," They're like, let's go running. "
"3796390","3799070"," I'm like, you don't want to cuddle, and you want me to scratch a belly and stuff?"
"3799610","3800950"," They're like, nah, leave me alone."
"3801830","3805950"," I'm going to go to my hole over here, just feed my belly with steak, and take me out for"
"3805950","3807590"," a run to chase down wild animals."
"3809810","3811510"," And I'm like, I'm like, okay. "
"3812670","3814250"," Even my dogs act differently."
"3814590","3816150"," We're like a bunch of savages around here."
"3816210","3817030"," A bunch of cavemen. "
"3822190","3823130"," It's pretty bad."
"3824850","3826310"," I don't know how you do..."
"3826310","3830430"," If you're a single guy out there, I don't know how you..."
"3830430","3834710"," I don't know what kind of semblance of normalcy you have behind the closed door."
"3835510","3837230"," But I'd probably be like..."
"3837230","3838370"," I'd be a full caveman. "
"3839830","3841870"," I think a big old beard."
"3842870","3844690"," I've been a bathrobe all day long."
"3849270","3853230"," I definitely wouldn't eat healthy. "
"3856090","3861170"," Like just shoveling like raw spinach in my mouth, and then a steak on the grill every night or"
"3861170","3861550"," something."
"3862890","3868650"," Like my family makes the nice spinach salad with the strawberries and the cheese and the raspberry"
"3868650","3869390"," dressing."
"3869750","3872710"," I would just be like shoveling spinach in my mouth raw. "
"3874950","3875650"," Pretty gross."
"3883630","3884910"," Okay, hold on a second here."
"3885070","3885670"," Hold on a second here. "
"3886430","3887250"," Hold on a second here."
"3887250","3887930"," Hold on a second here."
"3888510","3890390"," Hold on. "
"3890490","3890690"," Hold on."
"3890750","3891790"," I'm getting fired up in the background."
"3892110","3892350"," Let's go. "
"3894010","3895470"," The watch closed during work."
"3896150","3896370"," Hold on."
"3896790","3897270"," Hold on a second. "
"3897450","3897870"," I gotta see you."
"3898390","3899510"," Do you want to come on live?"
"3899890","3901410"," Do you want to come on live?"
"3910420","3912100"," We got a buddy here in the background."
"3919800","3921640"," Let's see if he wants to come on live or not. "
"3925660","3927680"," So just a couple of things here."
"3927760","3929280"," So we've got the Senate hearing on right now."
"3929440","3931500"," You're seeing a hedge on the market, right?"
"3931660","3932780"," We know there's a hedge on the market. "
"3934280","3934640"," Right?"
"3934800","3936140"," We know there's a hedge coming into today."
"3936320","3940340"," They'll likely be a hedge on the market as well tomorrow for..."
"3941840","3944520"," Jerome Powell's luncheon that he has."
"3944780","3945700"," So you see a hedge here. "
"3945980","3950040"," As soon as this hearing ends, it should be a squeeze higher at some point."
"3951200","3960120"," If you're looking for this hedge on the market just coming into this morning, take away the six"
"3960120","3960500"," here."
"3960760","3966660"," We'll just leave the black and the red and the white one up here so you can see it in"
"3966660","3967200"," the five minute. "
"3967840","3968540"," Selling it down."
"3968800","3971220"," Target's down below S2 here at 39364."
"3971220","3973200"," You should have your levels already. "
"3975680","3977640"," You should already have your levels from me previously."
"3978060","3979860"," You've got a target down below here of S1."
"3980060","3982580"," Then you've got a target down below of S2, 39364. "
"3983380","3985240"," Then you have S3 down below here."
"3986660","3987440"," Right here."
"3987580","3988900"," There's one more down below. "
"3989700","3992040"," Let me snap one more line down here for you."
"3994510","3995770"," One more right there."
"4000520","4005200"," There's an H line down below here of 3941 for the last squeeze that we had higher back up here. "
"4005920","4007460"," There's a bunch of different targets for you."
"4007560","4012960"," You've got S2, S1, S3, and then the H line down here at 3941."
"4014200","4017820"," As soon as these hearings are over, you should see a squeeze up in the market. "
"4021390","4024850"," On a one minute chart, you can see the crossover here."
"4026910","4028210"," There's a one minute chart right here."
"4028270","4029970"," You can see the barrel plane here. "
"4030150","4031150"," You don't need me at this point."
"4031890","4033170"," Tell you what a barrel plane is there."
"4033310","4033830"," You can see them. "
"4034630","4035350"," Right here."
"4035950","4037810"," You can see the other one right here."
"4037910","4039390"," You guys already know what your times are. "
"4040770","4041970"," Right here is another one."
"4043510","4045950"," That's called the barrel plane right there in a one minute chart."
"4046870","4049150"," You should see south side come back in again. "
"4049970","4053270"," Right here at 39551 somewhere in here."
"4054190","4055730"," You also know about times."
"4056390","4062310"," It's now 1056, so bears have another four minutes to get a new low. "
"4062310","4065110"," You can see back here at 1035."
"4065830","4066970"," Watch my cursor down here."
"4067070","4069310"," 1035, they got a new low. "
"4070070","4075050"," And so as we come into the 11 o'clock hour, they're going to have another five minutes to get"
"4075050","4075810"," a new low in here."
"4076390","4079970"," So we're coming into 1056, they have four minutes now to get a new low."
"4080370","4088310"," Bears want to get this low by 11 a.m. or so somewhere in here. "
"4088690","4089750"," Tag a new low down here."
"4090330","4095710"," If they don't get this low, we'll squeeze higher into this into this red tag above here."
"4095950","4101149"," I expect them to get the new low right now until the end of the Senate hearing once this hedge"
"4101149","4101750"," comes up. "
"4108240","4109279"," Let's see if he's ready."
"4123760","4125340"," No, I haven't heard nothing back yet."
"4130550","4131910"," He might not be able to come on. "
"4132790","4135790"," I told him I'd do this segment on Bitcoin for him today."
"4136590","4138630"," You can see right here this nice red line."
"4138750","4139430"," This is a rug pull. "
"4139649","4141370"," I want you to look on book map right now."
"4141990","4143010"," And hold on a second here."
"4145830","4148029"," I'm not catching up to the stream here with you guys. "
"4150109","4153250"," So you can see this little bit, this little bit of support here."
"4154330","4156330"," That's on book map down below where you've seen from."
"4156450","4157330"," It's a little bit of liquidity here. "
"4157670","4161670"," They should rug pull this and we should blast down lower here in just a moment."
"4163029","4164470"," I'm not confident in this."
"4165609","4169770"," In this support right here, I think this we're going to squeeze down and tag the 39364. "
"4170490","4171790"," Or at least get below it."
"4172529","4176550"," I shouldn't say it's going to go all the way down like bloodbath straight down here."
"4176569","4182350"," I think it's going to go next four, two minutes at least, maybe two to five minutes. "
"4182550","4183430"," Get a new low right here."
"4184229","4185850"," And then we'll get the squeeze up to the five."
"4186609","4188710"," And then hopefully we'll get back down here and hit 393. "
"4189310","4190630"," I'd like to see right here."
"4194460","4196160"," We'll see if they can get it."
"4196860","4198380"," We should be over right now. "
"4203110","4204730"," We will say so in that review."
"4205190","4207950"," And then Chairman Gruenberg, same to you."
"4208230","4210950"," You're conducting a scope of the FDIC. "
"4210950","4214450"," Are you comfortable that you can conduct that and be transparent and accountable?"
"4214750","4216670"," Or should there be an independent body looking at this?"
"4217070","4218230"," I think there's room for both."
"4218470","4223890"," As Michael indicated, I think it's important for each of our agencies to look internally at our"
"4223890","4225350"," supervision of these institutions."
"4226370","4228390"," And draw lessons from it. "
"4228450","4232950"," In our case, we've asked our chief risk officer who's not directly involved in the supervision"
"4232950","4236210"," process and has his role is to evaluate risk."
"4236590","4240630"," At the FDIC to undertake this internal."
"4240910","4244370"," So let's look at that fed financial stress index together. "
"4244510","4249730"," And then there's been a lot of talk in the meeting about the executive salaries."
"4250930","4254070"," About the executive bonuses about the sale of stock."
"4254490","4255550"," We'll take a look at that together. "
"4255830","4259310"," If you haven't already seen it, we'll take a look at it together."
"4259770","4260870"," It was on a fed to it."
"4260950","4261050"," Yes. "
"4261190","4262550"," I think it was a cheddar flow."
"4262890","4264070"," Whoever they are."
"4265070","4267050"," Flow cheddar cheddar flow or something like that. "
"4267690","4268790"," We'll take a look at it right now."
"4270370","4271190"," Thank you, Senator."
"4271930","4278130"," So you'll see you'll notice some previous examples here back in 2000 2001. "
"4278710","4280370"," You'll see the other example here in 2008."
"4281290","4283790"," We'll see the other example here in 2020."
"4284590","4288390"," And what we'll do is we'll highlight if you want to bring this up. "
"4288690","4290130"," You can Google search it at home."
"4290630","4294050"," It's the St. Louis Fed financial stress index."
"4295690","4297290"," We're in the middle of a Senate hearing right now. "
"4297430","4298170"," So we'll mute them."
"4298790","4299870"," We'll keep them quiet in the background."
"4300770","4304010"," There's two parts of this would be that you know the Fed knows about this. "
"4304790","4307130"," You know, the Fed is telling you the Treasury Department."
"4307130","4311730"," The Fed is telling you that they're reassuring you publicly that everything is fine, right?"
"4312350","4312970"," Everything is fine."
"4313110","4313590"," Everything is fine. "
"4313670","4314170"," Everything is fine."
"4314850","4324730"," You're seeing also, uh, astroturfing, astroturfing from institutions saying everything"
"4324730","4325250"," is fine."
"4325510","4326050"," Everything is fine. "
"4326510","4327010"," Everything is fine."
"4327790","4329910"," Specifically like governmental institutions."
"4330670","4337010"," You're seeing sell side hedge funds, uh, bond kings. "
"4337650","4339990"," They're going to tell you that everything is not fine."
"4341010","4346550"," You're going to see anyone, any institution like a bank that's short."
"4346550","4350650"," This market or hedge this market are going to rug pull regional banks. "
"4350650","4352350"," Any kind of investment they have in those."
"4352730","4358230"," So let's say I was a big bank and I was, I was long, uh, carry or regional banks."
"4358230","4360990"," Any kind, I'm going to rug pull that shit, right?"
"4361370","4363810"," I'm going to try to trigger a market crash. "
"4367530","4371830"," When you hear these, when you hear these, uh, these Senate hearings, they're telling you that."
"4372350","4375550"," When they're telling you that, um, it's all the VCs fault."
"4375810","4377150"," Yeah, some of it's the VCs fault. "
"4377670","4380670"," But I bet if you look at who actually took their money out of that stock."
"4381450","4384530"," I'm going to guarantee that it was sell side institutions."
"4385430","4390990"," Sell side, uh, banks, like prime banks that were long regional banks. "
"4391610","4395450"," This is not, this is a concerted effort, not from VCs."
"4395890","4400710"," This is a concerted effort from, uh, someone that's long bonds."
"4401250","4405550"," Someone that is, uh, wants the market to go lower, right?"
"4407990","4413330"," And then you've got the, then you've got the fed in the treasury department that they don't want. "
"4414150","4417870"," The one thing that's dangerous to a bank and that's a bank run."
"4418550","4420130"," So they're going to tell you everything is fine."
"4420490","4424230"," When, if you look at this report here, this chart here, it's not fine, right?"
"4424430","4425530"," We can tell that it's not fine. "
"4428430","4432150"," And we're going to just, I'm going to left click here and just highlight this zone right here."
"4433150","4433990"," And there you go."
"4433990","4434930"," It pops in. "
"4435090","4435810"," This is 2021."
"4437410","4437770"," 2022."
"4439430","4440910"," All the way over to 2023. "
"4440910","4449970"," You can start to see that we're at 1.5746. This is a financial stress index for the banks."
"4450850","4452150"," And you can see that it's rising."
"4454430","4460270"," 1.5746. If you come down to the bottom of your chart here and you move this over. "
"4463230","4464350"," And you look closer."
"4464650","4465570"," Let's just go to 2020."
"4466450","4469850"," Let's just go to 2020, uh, the 2020 crash. "
"4469850","4471570"," This is another thing I find fascinating."
"4472090","4479210"," You have, I see people out there say, well, you know, I'm looking at 2000, 2008, but as a crash"
"4479210","4480690"," example, but not 2020."
"4483270","4489030"," Because it was an, it was an, it was an abnormal, abnormal crash, but yet everything we're going"
"4489030","4489930"," through right now is. "
"4491230","4493090"," Pretty much associated with 2020."
"4493350","4495990"," So I don't think you can discount what happened in 2020."
"4495990","4497710"," I don't think you can. "
"4497870","4500590"," Everything we're going through right now is directly related."
"4500870","4505130"," Well, not everything, maybe like 70% is directly related to 2020."
"4505650","4509470"," We were already going to, we already do for a recession and a crash in 2019. "
"4510170","4515150"," We knew we were looking towards that heading into 2020, but we had a crash in 2020."
"4515250","4518030"," And a lot of what we're dealing with right now is related to that."
"4518170","4521250"," And this is pretty much the same as 2000 and 2008. "
"4521750","4522210"," Now."
"4524210","4527630"," With that said, you can look right here."
"4529510","4531310"," See if I can bring this up. "
"4531450","4531730"," So you got."
"4533310","4543130"," March 6th, 1.31. March 13th, 3.34. So right around mid March, like first"
"4543130","4544290"," week, second week of March."
"4545190","4546030"," On the fed. "
"4547110","4548650"," And there has to be an expectation."
"4549870","4551690"," That we're going to continue higher."
"4552490","4553610"," And here's a key point here. "
"4553730","4553870"," Okay."
"4555270","4558230"," March 6th, March 13th, March 20th."
"4560230","4560630"," Right. "
"4560790","4564010"," And on this on this data, right, the financial stress index."
"4567780","4571020"," And so if, oh, he has a nice little squeeze now up to 395 45."
"4572280","4573860"," We'll see if the bears can hold up. "
"4573940","4575080"," They did not get the new low."
"4575760","4577680"," This bottom did hold, which is good to see."
"4579540","4581500"," Now you're going to see the retest up higher. "
"4581700","4582860"," And actually this is good for bulls."
"4583820","4587120"," We'll see if this develops and see if we can buy a dip down here."
"4587920","4590460"," See if we can actually buy some kind of a dip to go higher here. "
"4592680","4597960"," You can start to see right now that the bear, the bear do might be over for the moment."
"4598600","4602840"," Now the key here, the key point that I want to make to here on that, that stress index."
"4602840","4608090"," As if you go back to 2020. "
"4612490","4613630"," Right down here."
"4614290","4617990"," This is the third, the fifth is in here somewhere."
"4619130","4621370"," And here is the 13th. "
"4621490","4623110"," So right where you are right now."
"4625960","4628640"," So the point that's being made by this."
"4634350","4637050"," Right here is the first dump, the second dump. "
"4637250","4638450"," This is all really fast, right?"
"4638650","4640450"," It's not taking place over a year or two."
"4640450","4643430"," But this end, this last little bit right here."
"4646720","4653920"," Would be the, the St. Louis Fed financial stress index continuing higher. "
"4654420","4656360"," Would be this last little bit down here."
"4656740","4658760"," And so that's the point that they're trying to make to you."
"4659080","4664480"," Is hey, if this continues higher, we could be seeing this last leg take place. "
"4664740","4667440"," This kind of validates what we say, right?"
"4667700","4671380"," That if the, if the, if the Fed financial stress index continues higher."
"4671380","4673620"," We'll see that last leg in the market."
"4675480","4677060"," And to expect it. "
"4677800","4678060"," Right."
"4678180","4680760"," So it's like one more, one more example in the market."
"4682660","4686560"," That we could see that last leg down in here. "
"4686820","4688860"," To that one last rollover."
"4689360","4693660"," Now, if you see that one last rollover in the market, though, how long does it last as the big"
"4693660","4694000"," question?"
"4694860","4695480"," Is it one month?"
"4695720","4696400"," Is it three months?"
"4697280","4700560"," Is it something where you should have sold here more than likely not?"
"4701280","4703540"," More than likely, it's also the bottom."
"4704560","4706560"," So you should be looking to deploy cash down there. "
"4708440","4713300"," And what you should also be looking for in the next coming days is knowing that the Fed is aware"
"4713300","4713680"," of this."
"4714200","4716440"," Knowing that you're going to have competing interests."
"4717760","4718440"," In the next few days. "
"4719000","4722020"," And probably the next week or two and even possibly into the minutes."
"4722780","4724180"," You're going to have competing interests."
"4724860","4726640"," And the story that's told. "
"4727500","4732380"," The competing interest in the story that's told is going to be."
"4734060","4740300"," Cell side hedge funds, self side prime banks, long bonds."
"4742000","4743640"," They're going to tell you. "
"4744720","4747840"," Hey, we're in a banking crisis."
"4748580","4755580"," We're in a banking crisis and we have a systemic contagion risk in prime banks."
"4756360","4757440"," That doesn't have to be true. "
"4757500","4758340"," It doesn't matter if it's true."
"4758460","4762740"," We just need the stress to go up and up and up to get that last capitulation moved down."
"4766260","4768280"," So you should be, hold on a second here. "
"4768400","4769540"," You should be aware of that."
"4769980","4770420"," Hold on here."
"4770480","4771240"," I'm getting weirdness here. "
"4774400","4775160"," Hold on here."
"4776280","4777140"," Getting some weird."
"4779200","4781300"," Getting some microphone issues here in my ear. "
"4786950","4787690"," Check one too."
"4788930","4790690"," I thought I was going deaf yesterday."
"4791030","4791750"," I was having air problems. "
"4792090","4792630"," I don't think it's errors."
"4792630","4793650"," I think it's my headset."
"4793650","4794910"," I don't think it's new headphones. "
"4797050","4806230"," So the point here is you're going to get two competing astroturfs, two competing"
"4806230","4808570"," astroturfs out there."
"4808670","4815670"," You're going to get the Fed saying, well, if we don't tell them that there's no contagion."
"4815990","4823590"," If we tell them there's no contagion, no systemic risk, we can cut off the St. Louis financial"
"4823590","4829130"," stress index from going higher. "
"4831980","4836600"," If we don't do that, we know that there's another leg down coming."
"4837360","4845100"," We know that it's in the financial interests of some institutions to get that next leg down."
"4849460","4852580"," As a whole, as opposed to a particular decision. "
"4852580","4855680"," It seems to me that that sounds like a distinction without a difference."
"4857020","4862000"," If any single bank's failure can cause contagion, that threatens the system."
"4862200","4865660"," And it seems that the bank should be considered systemically important. "
"4867980","4869180"," Uncle J.B. J."
"4869380","4869680"," Is hilarious."
"4869920","4871360"," He's like, didn't get that new low."
"4873260","4874640"," No, you didn't get the new low. "
"4875460","4881600"," You took extraordinary steps to protect uninsured depositors that could very well lead to increased"
"4881600","4883660"," fees charged to banks and ultimately to consumers."
"4884320","4888420"," So I think we need to be clear about what is a systemic risk."
"4890240","4892000"," Here you can hear him speaking right now. "
"4893580","4896020"," What is a systemic risk?"
"4897760","4902520"," Do you agree with President Biden's statement two weeks ago that Congress should strengthen rules"
"4902520","4907740"," for banks to make it less likely that we will see another failure similar to that of Silicon Valley"
"4907740","4907980"," Bank?"
"4910400","4911280"," Thank you, Senator."
"4911400","4914940"," I think it's important for us to strengthen capital and liquidity rules."
"4915460","4920420"," We're working on strengthening them as part of our Basel III reforms and our holistic review of"
"4920420","4920760"," capital. "
"4921420","4923600"," And I think we need to move forward with that."
"4924000","4930040"," And as both Chair Grumberg and I suggested with a long-term debt requirement that would provide an"
"4930040","4934200"," additional cushion in addition to capital for large institutions."
"4934520","4938040"," That work will need to go through notice and comment rulemaking. "
"4938360","4939940"," There will be transition periods for it."
"4940100","4943740"," But I think that is really important work for us to do and I'm committed to doing it."
"4944340","4949940"," Well, let me ask you, Mr. Barr, this morning I along with Senator Rounds and other members of this"
"4949940","4956020"," committee sent a letter to Chairman Powell asking him to explain whether the feds had applied"
"4956020","4962320"," enhanced supervision or prudential standards to Silicon Valley Bank or any similar-sized bank using"
"4962320","4964120"," the Fed's existing authority. "
"4965100","4970760"," We've also learned from public reporting that feds supervisors began flagging problems as a SBB as"
"4970760","4972520"," far back as 2021."
"4973480","4978120"," Now, I understand we have a lot more to learn about the facts that were transpired, both at the"
"4978120","4979520"," bank with any management failures."
"4979520","4984960"," But I expect that we're going to see that all factored in as part of a review. "
"4985240","4990800"," So as you begin that review, let me ask you, do you agree with Chairman Powell's statement last"
"4990800","4996440"," week that from what we know it is, quote, clear that we do need to strengthen supervision and"
"4996440","4996700"," regulation?"
"4997440","4999400"," Yes, I absolutely agree with that statement."
"4999600","5000180"," Thank you for that."
"5000460","5009940"," Now, lastly, what I would love to know, Mr. Grumberg, as we think about, should we raise"
"5009940","5012160"," the federal deposit insurance?"
"5012880","5018320"," What percentage of account holders is that account for how much is private versus business?"
"5019660","5022780"," And what are the costs that are associated with itself?"
"5023400","5026960"," I'll just put that out there for you to submit an answer to the record because it will take more"
"5026960","5028200"," time than what I have. "
"5028200","5035200"," But the last point I want to make is we have seen a flight from regional and community banks to,"
"5035460","5037160"," quote, unquote, too big to fail banks."
"5037560","5039080"," I'm going to refresh the video."
"5039080","5040680"," The concentration of the deposits. "
"5040820","5042680"," It's trending tough to end the quite a few rules."
"5043360","5045980"," What are the costs that are associated with itself?"
"5046540","5049300"," I'll just put that out there for you to submit an answer to the record."
"5049600","5050160"," I'll speed it up. "
"5050460","5051340"," Then what I have."
"5051540","5056620"," But the last point I want to make is we have seen a flight from regional and community banks to"
"5056620","5057520"," quote, unquote, too big to fail banks."
"5058140","5062320"," And in concentration of deposits at a select few institutions also brings about its own risk to the"
"5062320","5062800"," financial system. "
"5062800","5067480"," At the end of the day, it seems that we are incentivizing entities to go to big to fail banks."
"5067480","5069320"," It looks like WAPO is way behind."
"5069780","5071700"," What we want to, ultimately, is to be a fine PBS. "
"5072320","5075920"," Senator, I think that the goal of the actions that we took are to make sure that we have a"
"5075920","5081380"," thriving and diverse system of banking in the United States including community banks and regional"
"5081380","5085180"," banks that are the lifeblood of many communities all across the country."
"5085960","5092740"," I think we called it this extension and my view is one step."
"5093040","5097440"," As you know, I've advocated for our country to provide not only strong military. "
"5097760","5098440"," I'll run one here."
"5112280","5114540"," Usually PBS is the fastest one."
"5116040","5123700"," At the end of the day, it seems that we are incentivizing entities to go to big to fail banks. "
"5123980","5125540"," It only makes it even more consequential in terms of too big to do."
"5125660","5127400"," Is that what we want to ultimately achieve in this process?"
"5128560","5132140"," Senator, I think that the goal of the actions that we took are to make sure that we have a"
"5132140","5135940"," thriving and diverse system of banking in the United States including community banks and regional"
"5135940","5137840"," banks that are the lifeblood of many communities all across the country."
"5138480","5138880"," Thank you, Senator. "
"5138880","5140640"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"5140800","5141400"," Thank you all for being here today."
"5141480","5141780"," Chairman Barr. "
"5141780","5143760"," We are the Federal Reserve."
"5143900","5148780"," I just tested 34 banks in 2022."
"5149160","5150020"," Is that correct?"
"5153050","5156690"," Senator, I don't have the exact number in front of me, but that's. "
"5157790","5158430"," I have your."
"5158590","5159610"," It says 34."
"5160750","5163030"," Now we're talking about stress testing right now. "
"5163130","5163830"," Is there financial?"
"5164430","5166010"," Is there risk systemic risk?"
"5166670","5168990"," See a squeezing now failure to get a new low."
"5170410","5174330"," Beginning to squeeze higher now, trading above 395 61."
"5174650","5179430"," Rules that were put in place for transition into the stress testing. "
"5179850","5184350"," It takes a while for a firm to be considered above the threshold."
"5185050","5187410"," They need to have a rolling four quarter average."
"5187430","5190730"," Did you stress test Silicon Valley bank in 2022?"
"5191350","5191550"," No. "
"5191550","5192190"," Okay."
"5193190","5199810"," Silicon Valley bank had a hundred billion dollars, more than a hundred billion dollars in assets."
"5200310","5202410"," Currently squeezing up to the weekly trigger. "
"5202870","5203690"," Monthly trigger."
"5203950","5204270"," Excuse me."
"5204550","5210570"," Senator, I was explaining that the transition rules in place at the time require a rolling four"
"5210570","5212490"," quarter average to be above that amount. "
"5213070","5213170"," Okay."
"5213370","5218570"," And then if the firm is happens to be in a year that isn't a year that since it's in"
"5218570","5222950"," every other year test that a test is running, then it waits till the next year."
"5223190","5228010"," So for Silicon Valley bank, that would have meant 2024 would be its first stress test. "
"5228230","5230570"," So if you're a bull, what are you looking for is the point here."
"5231110","5235730"," You're looking for the bed in the treasury department and the Senate to play ball."
"5235990","5237890"," Of course, using its own stress test. "
"5237930","5238610"," Did you have the alarm?"
"5238610","5240630"," And make people believe that there is no."
"5241370","5243550"," Under our existing regulations, no."
"5243930","5247890"," We would have to change our regulations to have further stress to the banking. "
"5249630","5251450"," The Congress industry."
"5252310","5254150"," Over the course of the next two days."
"5254570","5255690"," And you're looking for the fed. "
"5256010","5258950"," How to come out and say the same thing."
"5259190","5260950"," Section two, five, two point three."
"5261150","5270170"," Isn't that the fact that we gave the federal reserve the authority to stress test Silicon Valley"
"5270170","5276950"," bank under under that legislation, the Federal Reserve could have played in place a rule to finding"
"5276950","5281110"," the word periodic, but you did it a different way than than was done. "
"5281350","5282190"," But you didn't."
"5282350","5283910"," Fed financial stress."
"5284370","5284630"," Okay. "
"5286490","5289110"," If you had stress test, so."
"5290550","5292490"," Fed financial stress index."
"5293310","5295150"," Spoken about in the Senate this morning. "
"5295630","5300050"," It wouldn't have made any difference, would it?"
"5300530","5302510"," I don't know the answer to that question."
"5302510","5307690"," Well, you didn't test for Silicon Valley bank's problem."
"5308350","5309530"," I've read your report. "
"5310450","5319030"," Your stress test, you stress tested these 34 banks for following GDP, spiking unemployment into"
"5319030","5320690"," false and commercial real estate."
"5321510","5322370"," Isn't that correct?"
"5322890","5323130"," Yes."
"5323330","5327390"," That's the next big one for bears is going to be commercial real estate. "
"5327550","5331490"," You'll see the fed in the treasury card saying we're going to support all of this commercial"
"5331490","5333390"," banking or commercial real estate."
"5333670","5338730"," Our problem is inflation high interest rate and loss of value in government bonds, isn't it?"
"5339090","5340250"," I completely agree with you."
"5340450","5345070"," So you stress tested in 2002 for the wrong thing. "
"5345730","5350590"," The stress test is not the primary way that the Federal Reserve or other regulators test for"
"5350590","5351110"," interest rate."
"5351350","5353790"," But you stress tested for the wrong thing."
"5354610","5359470"," As I said, Senator, I agree with you that it would be useful to test for higher rising interest"
"5359470","5359810"," rates. "
"5360350","5365530"," That's why in our alternative scenario, multiple scenario that we put in place for this year's"
"5365530","5366650"," stress test, we do that."
"5367230","5370830"," These decisions were made before I arrived, but I agree with you."
"5370970","5376850"," But it's like somebody going in for a test for COVID and getting a test for common. "
"5380310","5382510"," I don't know enough about either of those."
"5383950","5385350"," Well, they're different."
"5388730","5394390"," So all this business about, well, the amendment to Dodd-Frank kept them from stress testing. "
"5395590","5398070"," The way I see it, you chose not to stress testing if you had stress testing."
"5399870","5401410"," That's Silicon Valley Bank."
"5402130","5403270"," You wouldn't have caught the problem. "
"5404150","5407790"," As I said, Senator, I agree with you that the statute."
"5408230","5409590"," This is false, by the way."
"5410450","5412730"," You can't stress test a bank run. "
"5412730","5415030"," You can implement that in 2019."
"5415990","5420710"," That resulted in SPB not being tested until plan to be tested until 2020."
"5420990","5425870"," SPB though does sound like a sexually transmitted disease, doesn't it?"
"5426530","5427630"," I'm not going to lie. "
"5429390","5436930"," But you knew the Federal Reserve knew well in advance that Silicon Valley Bank had a problem."
"5437110","5438110"," Yeah, pretty stupid, right?"
"5438110","5443830"," Too much of its money in interest rates since the long government bonds did."
"5444050","5450450"," I think the investing public and the Federal Reserve, which cited it for interest rate problems,"
"5450450","5452130"," knew that it had interest rates. "
"5452130","5453170"," Yeah, that's the thing."
"5453930","5456490"," There's no actual risk."
"5456850","5460070"," All of these bonds would cover down the road at some point. "
"5460290","5461650"," I disagree with that."
"5461850","5465290"," You can't stress test a bank run."
"5465290","5466710"," It's the only thing you can't do. "
"5467010","5467730"," Well, you can."
"5468050","5470130"," That's when you have federal government intervention."
"5470130","5471830"," And it failed to act on this. "
"5471930","5472830"," You didn't follow up."
"5473270","5477240"," Time has expired."
"5477480","5485380"," I didn't watch Mr. Barr reluctant to criticize some of the moves of his predecessors at the Federal"
"5485380","5485680"," Reserve. "
"5485860","5486380"," I'll leave the debt."
"5486620","5487240"," Although I do agree."
"5487420","5489020"," I mean, there's still problems with these banks. "
"5489500","5490220"," Thank you."
"5490220","5492140"," These banks still had opportunity to hedge."
"5492880","5495140"," They were it was telegraph players day. "
"5495140","5498820"," So I want to just to start by really that rates would be raised."
"5498880","5499640"," They knew."
"5499980","5502220"," I mean, we can't say that there was a group full on greed. "
"5502540","5504280"," I heard you say very clearly."
"5504960","5506500"," There's like layers to this."
"5506620","5508000"," It's not just one thing. "
"5508220","5509400"," I guess my point here."
"5509640","5510860"," Not just one thing."
"5511020","5518560"," There's layers to the greed and layers to what the intent of the impact is. "
"5519340","5522980"," Strong and decisive action to protect people and to keep our banking system."
"5522980","5524940"," Who stands to make money here?"
"5525120","5529540"," And you can see the different layers of who stands to make most money here."
"5529700","5530200"," Extraordinary. "
"5530660","5533540"," Extraordinary actions were called for a moment."
"5533540","5536080"," And you of course don't want to have to use extraordinary actions."
"5536140","5543060"," You want to be able to rely on banks to do to make good decisions and to protect their shareholders"
"5543060","5544440"," and to protect their depositors. "
"5545100","5549540"," But let me just clarify one thing before I want to follow up a little bit on Senator Kennedy's"
"5549540","5549880"," questions."
"5551980","5561520"," The Fed under the previous vice chair of supervision put into place rules that"
"5561520","5566640"," I think there's a question about whether those rules mean I think even in the moment you are"
"5566640","5568000"," critical of those rules."
"5568100","5568540"," Is that right?"
"5569440","5570640"," Yes, that's correct. "
"5571160","5579920"," And so your review will take a look at what would have happened if those rules hadn't happened."
"5579920","5585100"," You can make decisions about what new rules need to be in place to protect from this kind of"
"5585100","5588280"," extraordinary situation that we saw with these two banks."
"5588520","5589300"," Is that correct?"
"5589720","5590360"," Yes, that's correct. "
"5590600","5596460"," So I think that's just important for us all to understand here as we think about what has happened."
"5597380","5599440"," I caught a bad case of the SBB."
"5599580","5600560"," It's using everywhere. "
"5600960","5605620"," The management failures at many levels all coming together at the worst possible time."
"5605620","5610620"," And I'm particularly struck by the bank's failure to manage interest rate risk."
"5610680","5611480"," Hey, but had bangers. "
"5611480","5612260"," What's going on, brother?"
"5612520","5615800"," Last week, which is basic bank management."
"5616080","5616740"," It's not rough."
"5616880","5617680"," Squeezing in here now. "
"5617760","5619120"," Got a little bull plane forming here."
"5620100","5623140"," Should see a retest on the downside here in just a moment."
"5623140","5623580"," Excuse me. "
"5623660","5625520"," We're near zero for more than a decade."
"5625520","5629260"," And a lot of business models that appears including Silicon Valley banks business."
"5629540","5631980"," Squeeze up for the top of the daily trigger free money. "
"5633240","5635940"," And that obviously presents risks when that changes."
"5636280","5637020"," So I'm concerned."
"5637480","5640220"," I'm up here and see if we can get some confirmation for a move higher here. "
"5640320","5646280"," Other institutions, banks and non-banks alike, how they are managing what must be similar interest"
"5646280","5646900"," rate risks."
"5647140","5651400"," Could you just address that and talk about how the Fed right now and others."
"5651460","5653480"," We'll look at the five minute chart really quick here for you. "
"5653820","5656200"," And what that tells you about what we need to do differently."
"5661000","5661960"," Thank you, Senator."
"5663460","5665380"," This is the hourly trigger right now. "
"5665500","5669460"," The banks are highly effective in managing interest rate risk and liquidity risk."
"5670040","5673520"," It is the bread and butter kind of worth of bank management."
"5674300","5678600"," So we are monitoring the financial system, monitoring the banking system. "
"5679460","5684740"," We're looking at interest rate risk and liquidity risk across the banking system to assess that."
"5685160","5689920"," Where banks need to do better at interest rate risk and liquidity risk management, we're pointing"
"5689920","5690360"," that out."
"5690360","5693380"," But I think the fundamental point is the banking system. "
"5693680","5696000"," It takes quite a lot of use."
"5696840","5703260"," I had a chance to meet with a group of Minnesota bankers, including Minnesota has more community"
"5703260","5706460"," bankers, I think, per capita than any state in the country."
"5706820","5710840"," And they were eager to point out to me that their business models are very different from the"
"5710840","5712980"," business models of highly risky enterprises. "
"5713340","5714280"," That's bullshit too."
"5714460","5717300"," And so I appreciate you raising that."
"5717300","5722100"," In fact, I've been getting texts from some of my bankers today watching this hearing and wanting to"
"5722100","5725040"," point out that difference. "
"5726600","5734700"," Mr. Barr, can you talk about the risks of interest rate, sort of this interest rate risk, as it"
"5734700","5737700"," might affect non-banking institutions?"
"5738160","5740220"," As for example, mortgage loan companies."
"5740740","5741440"," Ding, ding, ding."
"5741660","5741820"," Thank you. "
"5742000","5743640"," First, let me just, you know."
"5743640","5744720"," Mortgage loan companies."
"5745140","5745720"," Commercial. "
"5746280","5747240"," Be more specific."
"5747700","5749880"," Say what it really is."
"5751220","5756080"," The vibrancy and the health of that community banking sector, and we see that too. "
"5757200","5763200"," We are obviously looking at interest rate risk as it affects not only banks, but also the non-bank"
"5763200","5763680"," sector."
"5764380","5769780"," We look at, of course, non-bank mortgage servicers that we're looking at hedge funds."
"5769780","5776180"," We're looking broadly across the financial landscape to see where those risks might arise and how"
"5776180","5780000"," those might propagate in other ways into the banking system. "
"5780240","5781180"," So we're highly attuned to that."
"5781460","5787320"," But again, I think the basic point is that the banking system is down in resilient depositors are"
"5787320","5787680"," safe."
"5789180","5791860"," And we've, through our actions, demonstrated that. "
"5791860","5792980"," Thank you very much."
"5793100","5793680"," Thank you, Mr. Chair."
"5794160","5796640"," Senator Smith, Senator Lummus of Wyoming is recognized. "
"5797260","5799600"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, panel."
"5800300","5804860"," I want to follow up a little bit on Senator Kennedy's line of question."

"5857760","5862800"," Federal Reserve to take into account higher risk profiles presented by certain banks."
"5862800","5866140"," Nice little successful retest here on the bull plane that's forming."
"5866340","5867920"," So you look at Silicon Valley Bank. "
"5869000","5873920"," They had a number of activities with above average risk profiles."
"5874920","5877520"," They're concentration of deposits."
"5878500","5880940"," The quantity of uninsured deposits. "
"5881480","5883940"," 94% uninsured deposits."
"5885220","5892940"," Then you look at Federal Reserve authority under regulation double Y."
"5893640","5898960"," To impose additional risk based or leverage capital or liquidity requirements."
"5899900","5901500"," She doesn't even know what she's reading. "
"5902440","5904420"," She's like, I don't even know what I'm reading right now."
"5904800","5912580"," I look at all this and I think that among all these statutes and regulations, the Fed had plenty of"
"5912580","5922100"," authority to prevent Silicon Valley Bank and the problems it encountered and"
"5922100","5926760"," was aware pretty early on that there were unique problems there."
"5926760","5933820"," It was a very, very unique financial institution because of its risk profile but didn't do it. "
"5934980","5938900"," As I look at what authority you've been given."
"5939600","5940500"," Yeah, thanks Blindness."
"5940620","5941240"," I appreciate it. "
"5941240","5947380"," Additional rule or regulation or law that you need it."

"5957020","5961340"," Notice in common rulemaking the rules that were put in place in 2019."
"5961560","5963480"," Down here we had a failure to make a new low."
"5963700","5965620"," To firms over a hundred billion. "
"5965920","5971160"," There are some areas that on the hourly we didn't get that new low down here."
"5971260","5974380"," You want this low and the half hour and then this low in the hour didn't get it."
"5974400","5978680"," The Federal Reserve to change that negates for any kind of a lower move. "
"5979540","5982840"," Bull's takeover starts sending it higher here."
"5982900","5985960"," We would have to go through a notice in common rulemaking process."

"5988440","5989160"," Bull plane forms."
"5989420","5992000"," I guess that's a little aggressive."
"5992000","5994520"," We haven't made a decision on that. "

"6006960","6007920"," We're looking at that."
"6007920","6011240"," Come down to the one and start to attack this hourly."
"6012180","6015800"," And then this daily here at three ninety six thirty. "
"6016280","6017420"," Online banking."
"6018300","6021760"," Senator let me just say stops below here."
"6021960","6028280"," I said before which is that overall the safety and sound is the banking system is strong. "
"6029280","6034460"," Banks are safe and sound depositors should feel assured that their deposits are safe."
"6034460","6040220"," Well here's the problem though as I see it the way that these banks have been managed."
"6040840","6045540"," Wyoming's community banks may end up paying for this through higher. "
"6045800","6048420"," Squeezing down to the hourly trigger from the FDIC."
"6048420","6049500"," Am I correct?"
"6050540","6051100"," Mr. Bloomberg."
"6051660","6057240"," Well as I indicated Senator in regard to these two institutions. "
"6058580","6063300"," Any cost to the deposit insurance fund from covering uninsured deposits."
"6063780","6069280"," Is required by law to be recovered through an assessment on the banking industry."
"6069500","6070000"," Exactly. "
"6070260","6074740"," If I make just one additional point the law does give the FDIC authority."
"6075360","6077360"," In implementing that assessment."
"6077960","6083100"," To consider the types of entities that benefit from any action taken or assistance provided. "
"6083100","6087180"," So are you saying that you're able to exempt Wyoming's community."
"6087380","6089560"," There's like layers of shit here."
"6089560","6091160"," We have some discretion there. "
"6091380","6093080"," There's like a there's like a shit."
"6093460","6095320"," I'm not a shit pie like a shit cake."
"6095380","6098600"," Will you exempt community banks from having to pay for this. "
"6098800","6100920"," That's a judgment our board is going to have to make."
"6101340","6103080"," It's like layers of shit."
"6103260","6105000"," You've got golden parachutes everywhere. "
"6105840","6109920"," You've got some people that want the markets to burning fast because they're short."
"6109920","6111360"," And as I indicated."
"6112000","6116020"," You've got lawmakers that want to look good and don't know what they're talking about. "
"6116300","6116780"," Assess."
"6117340","6118000"," That's the law."
"6118300","6120060"," That's the legal requirement. "
"6120280","6120640"," Thank you."
"6120660","6121200"," Mr. Chairman."
"6122260","6123380"," Thank you. "
"6123440","6125820"," Senator Warren of Massachusetts is recognizing."
"6126420","6126840"," Thank you."
"6126880","6127500"," Mr. Chairman. "
"6127580","6133040"," So we just experienced the second and third largest bank failures in American history."
"6133040","6133820"," Squeeze in high now."
"6133900","6136920"," 396 tags on the hourly. "
"6137900","6145780"," One more profit our PT above at 396.28. And I'll soon introduce a bipartisan bill to do exactly"
"6145780","6146420"," that."
"6146880","6148060"," But let's be clear."
"6148260","6153860"," These collapses also represent a massive failure in supervision over our nation's banks. "
"6154780","6160440"," So coming out of the 2008 crisis, Congress put tough banking rules in place."
"6160440","6165940"," Now big banks hated them and their CEOs lobbied hard to weaken those rules."
"6166600","6169860"," Ultimately, Congress signed off and then it got bad. "
"6170660","6171440"," Really bad."
"6171880","6179140"," Regulators burned down dozens of safeguards that were meant to stop banks from making risky bets."
"6179800","6185480"," Now the three of you here today represent US Treasury and two of our top banking regulators. "
"6185480","6192920"," I'd like to know if you believe that we need to strengthen our banking rules going forward to"
"6192920","6196280"," ensure the safety of our financial system."
"6196980","6199080"," Vice Chair Barr, let me start with you."
"6199240","6203200"," Do you believe we should strengthen our financial rules going forward?"
"6203500","6203860"," No. "
"6204900","6205960"," Thank you."
"6206680","6208140"," You can adjust them."
"6208280","6208760"," That's about it. "
"6208760","6210420"," You as well."
"6210760","6217240"," Two weeks ago, he stated that we must quote, strengthen the rules for banks to make it less likely"
"6217240","6220020"," that this kind of bank failure would happen again."
"6220540","6222300"," Chairman Grunberg, what about you?"
"6222760","6225920"," Do you agree with President Biden that we need to strengthen that?"
"6225920","6227360"," This is a full scam right now. "
"6227520","6229580"," This whole conversation is a full scam."
"6230020","6230140"," Good."
"6230800","6231360"," And look at him. "
"6231460","6237060"," He's sitting at the table and he's like, he's like, this is, he's like, he's like, I'm just saying"
"6237060","6237780"," yes to diarrhea."
"6237780","6240120"," We need to prevent these types of bank failures."
"6240400","6241300"," Well, I'm asking you. "
"6241380","6242700"," Of course, we need to prevent them."
"6242740","6245820"," But that's not by simply wishing it."
"6246140","6247600"," It's by stronger regulation. "
"6247980","6248400"," Is that right?"
"6248560","6248780"," I agree."
"6249020","6249500"," Okay."
"6249840","6249920"," Good. "
"6250500","6255220"," Now, we need to get our laws here in Congress, but let's also talk about- Do this lot of"
"6255220","6258860"," questioning is- Even before Congress acts."
"6259520","6265980"," Under current law, the Federal Reserve has the discretion to apply stronger prudential standards on"
"6265980","6271480"," banks with assets between 100 billion and 250 billion."
"6271860","6274680"," Exactly the size of Silicon Valley bank. "
"6275080","6278040"," That authority is not being used right now."
"6278520","6284720"," Vice Chair Barr, will you use your authority to strengthen rules for the largest banks in this"
"6284720","6290100"," country as you use your authority to strengthen the rules for the largest bank?"
"6290220","6291200"," I don't mind this part."
"6291200","6296640"," The strength in rules are like, as long as it's not a big hammer, it's not so- It's not"
"6296640","6297040"," negative. "
"6297380","6298620"," A hundred billion dollars?"
"6300100","6303240"," Senator- Like the language here is not that bad."
"6303400","6304120"," I understand."
"6304400","6304660"," I understand. "
"6304660","6310720"," In this process, but I anticipate the need to strengthen capital and liquidity standards for firms"
"6310720","6312000"," over a hundred billion dollars."
"6312060","6313020"," This is a key part of this."
"6313600","6319020"," So this is- Right now is that- We're going to push down further in terms of the greater"
"6319020","6321320"," scrutiny- You don't want to hear the hammer talk. "
"6321580","6323200"," If there's hammer talk, that's bad."
"6323500","6326400"," It began torching rule after rule in 2000."
"6326600","6328400"," So this is more grandstanding at this point. "
"6328520","6329960"," This is kind of a big nothing burger here."
"6329980","6337920"," Under your predecessor joined in on the fund and also started weakening FDIC rules across the"
"6337920","6338200"," board."
"6338700","6343440"," Capital and liquidity requirements, stress tests, you name it. "
"6343440","6353260"," In fact, your predecessor explicitly told these banks that if FDIC bank examiners were asking too"
"6353260","6359060"," many questions that they should quote, let us know end quote."
"6359540","6364880"," Now, there's a banking regulator who makes it clear that she is there to serve the big banks."
"6364880","6365320"," Yeah, I know. "
"6365480","6366440"," I know."
"6366440","6369540"," Someone on someone on Fintuit butt head bangers."
"6370200","6373040"," Someone on Fintuit was like, she's not an economist. "
"6373340","6374440"," I'm like, no, but her husband is."
"6376180","6377040"," Famous one."
"6377620","6380200"," With greater than a hundred billion dollars. "
"6381560","6382740"," All time investors."
"6383020","6386980"," I was a member of the board at that time and voted against those measures."
"6387480","6394460"," And I certainly think it's appropriate for us to go back and review those actions in light of the"
"6394460","6395420"," recent episode. "
"6396620","6398000"," And consider what changes."
"6398240","6401780"," I have to say, review sounds a little wishy here."
"6401960","6404260"," You didn't think they were good rules to begin with. "
"6404620","6405680"," My views haven't changed."
"6405960","6406580"," All right."
"6406840","6408240"," So you still think they were a bad idea?"
"6408560","6409120"," I do. "
"6409380","6409740"," Got it."
"6409940","6410200"," Yes."
"6410280","6414200"," So this guy is saying the same thing that I would say like the rules are the rules are generally"
"6414200","6415480"," good right now. "
"6415600","6417500"," Now there are rules for big banks."
"6417920","6420100"," We're going to mute this right here because I want to talk about this."
"6420810","6425120"," The rules on these banks are pretty good. "
"6426260","6432200"," Now there was greed by, of course, the bank execs."
"6433460","6435380"," VCs as well."
"6436740","6440700"," And we do know that the rules need to be adjusted for. "
"6441840","6443400"," For knowing."
"6444180","6450860"," My hedges, treasury bonds, pre rate increases, and I probably should have not taken on more"
"6450860","6451200"," hedging."
"6451460","6452620"," Those kind of rules can put in place. "
"6453040","6454200"," There's nothing you can do though."
"6454500","6455200"," Be aware of that."
"6455240","6456640"," Nothing can do for bank runs. "
"6457260","6461540"," And you also need to see in the background who's creating some of this bank."
"6462020","6462940"," Some of these bank runs."
"6463240","6469560"," You know that these banks are already on the decline prior to the bank runs months before. "
"6469560","6476480"," You already know that a lot of these stocks are owned by large institutions."
"6477380","6480400"," These institutions by bonds on lows."
"6480500","6486860"," They need to create a moment in the market to go down so that these bonds can print. "
"6488240","6491360"," There's layers to the bullshit is my point."
"6492040","6495140"," The golden parachute out there is for the execs."
"6495460","6498920"," The golden parachute is out there for these VCs, right?"
"6499600","6502520"," A nice little squeeze here in the spot of 39609. "
"6502820","6506840"," And it's a key moment here in this hearing that you don't want to hear."
"6509220","6512160"," New structural change to the rules for these banks."
"6512760","6514880"," You want to hear like, we're going to adjust this stuff. "
"6515040","6516860"," We're going to strengthen this and strengthen that."
"6517120","6520100"," And that's actually a good thing for the market to hear that kind of stuff."
"6520600","6525940"," And you're seeing some pushback from these people that are being grilled by the Senate right now. "
"6525980","6527260"," They're just like, yeah, fuck you."
"6527360","6528060"," We already know."
"6528060","6529000"," We're executing this process. "
"6529000","6530640"," However, the FBI should use the system."
"6530680","6534120"," The other key point here is you've got the Fed note."
"6534360","6536100"," You know, I know these people are going to be honest with you. "
"6536500","6544040"," The Fed knows too that there are institutions like banking institutions that are trying to profit"
"6544040","6545940"," and mass off of this."
"6546420","6549020"," They know that there are VCs and bank execs."
"6549020","6554500"," And prime banks that want to profit off of all this from start to bottom. "
"6554500","6560580"," You trade sources, calculations, rushing your crude prices for April loading, stay below $60 per"
"6560580","6561400"," barrel price cap."
"6563900","6565800"," 22 billion in losses already accrued."
"6566540","6568060"," That position just doesn't square reality. "
"6568920","6573260"," And so I guess if you're like, if you're, if you just like some guy out there, some woman out"
"6573260","6581560"," there, whatever, you do want to, at some point to hear, you don't want to hear the Fed giving into"
"6581560","6583300"," these banks profiting this last leg."
"6583760","6584480"," That's what they want to do."
"6584540","6585620"," They want to profit their last leg. "
"6585800","6587760"," Last leg of profit here is in the bond market."
"6588540","6591540"," Last time I checked, those costs to get passed along to the consumer."
"6592540","6597530"," Those are basically a set of policing, right?"
"6597870","6599970"," It's started months ago. "
"6601750","6605450"," And it begs the question of why you had to invoke that extraordinary exception."
"6606410","6611710"," Just this past Sunday's announcement of a new purchaser, part of SBB, not only were serious losses"
"6611710","6611990"," incurred."
"6612430","6614290"," We looked at the business cycle, right?"
"6614470","6622170"," We know that XLF, we know that financial financial banks out there in this cycle are bound to go"
"6622170","6622490"," down. "
"6622490","6631270"," And this is pre-positioning from institutions knowing that they can create this environment where"
"6631270","6632550"," we are currently in the market."
"6633590","6634950"," What was your counteroff?"
"6635290","6640030"," Did you engage with the board of the bank that didn't approve this to get them to step up and"
"6640030","6640510"," approve it?"
"6640750","6648010"," We received one offer that was frankly more expensive than the cost of it."
"6648010","6649590"," I got something else fascinating for you. "
"6650110","6650590"," Sorry."
"6654110","6659170"," I would have to check with our staff in terms of how much of a back and forth."
"6659370","6661050"," Let's talk about the bidding process itself. "
"6661690","6668310"," Were certain banks dissuaded by you or anyone else associated with this from bidding on SBB, either"
"6668310","6673150"," before or after the bank was taken into the U.S. Squeezing higher now into the daily trigger."
"6673150","6678970"," I was inundated with phone calls telling me that legitimate debtors were being waived off of the"
"6678970","6679370"," process."
"6680230","6683710"," It's $396.26 or so is the price target here. "
"6683830","6685390"," The ideology had anything to do with this."
"6685590","6686570"," Let me see if they can show it to you."
"6688450","6692790"," I look forward to the GAO as a port on this because the result of this failure places the banking"
"6692790","6695950"," sector in a state of disarray that we've never seen before. "
"6696810","6700810"," In spite of all the preparation and tools that you disclose, the FEIC failed to do its job."
"6700810","6703390"," There was obviously enough demand to orchestrate a sale."
"6703850","6707430"," What it looks like to the American people is that you simply didn't feel the incentive to execute"
"6707430","6710750"," and leaned on the systemic risk exemption to buy time. "
"6711430","6715570"," And in doing so, to place the entire U.S. banking sector into uncharted waters."
"6716410","6718030"," Nice beautiful squeeze here."
"6718930","6719990"," And this is a disgrace. "
"6720310","6721470"," I look forward to the GAO review."
"6721910","6729890"," Hedges are looking for the heads on the market was looking for a material change in the Senate's."
"6729890","6732570"," In response to 2008 financial crisis, the size. "
"6732650","6734330"," See the squeeze up here in the overnight."
"6736330","6737030"," Squeezing again."
"6737530","6738090"," Very erratic. "
"6738370","6739910"," A lot of erraticness right now."
"6740070","6741150"," You can see this is abnormal."
"6743330","6744790"," All of this was in. "
"6744850","6749670"," You can see the tag just now above on the hourly trigger."
"6750190","6758010"," This is the weekly and the daily price is now trading above the monthly."
"6758010","6764350"," The five minute, the one minute, the hourly and now smashing and bashing into this daily. "
"6764690","6767810"," We should see at some point even larger squeeze coming up here."
"6768470","6773430"," Big keep price up here and allow all these triggers to come up and run underneath."
"6774070","6777470"," Should be able to get some kind of a blast off north here in just a bit. "
"6778010","6779950"," Ignoring one of the most basic risk in bank."
"6780130","6784230"," You want to make sure that price stays above 395.60. But they have their failure."
"6785450","6788030"," SBBCO sat on the board of the San Francisco Fed. "
"6788170","6792070"," So 395.60. What went wrong in your in your supervision?"
"6793510","6794890"," Will you consider the level of manager?"
"6795130","6796050"," Right here."
"6796050","6797890"," Right where we are right here."
"6797970","6799270"," We want to see price stay above. "
"6799750","6802950"," The center of the staff have to get a nice fat squeeze."
"6803530","6804850"," That might have addressed."
"6805050","6807250"," We're going to watch this retest for the next trade. "
"6814230","6816730"," Right with this yellow box is you don't want to see."
"6818250","6822870"," You want to see a successful retest down here."
"6822990","6832050"," If we can get a successful recest down here we should get a nice nice slam up here. "
"6832050","6837840"," Since the urgency of fair disposal we certainly do another thing."
"6837960","6838680"," Well beyond the reason."
"6840660","6841140"," Absolutely. "
"6841140","6842460"," Thank you for your questions."
"6843440","6845640"," I'm going to ask the questions now if I might."
"6846740","6847840"," Right in here. "
"6847940","6848620"," Trade is good."
"6849700","6851440"," Two down here to 395."
"6852020","6852440"," 395. "
"6854000","6855680"," We do need to protect Americans."
"6856160","6856880"," Fifty nine."
"6857140","6858060"," Small business folks. "
"6858440","6861880"," We need to hold bank executives accountable when they screw up."
"6863060","6867560"," And if the regulators were asleep at the wheel, we need to hold them accountable."
"6868980","6873120"," Look, a correlation I would say is when I run my farm, if I look at the price of diesel"
"6873120","6876220"," fuel and seed, and that's all I look at, I don't get the whole picture. "
"6877260","6879700"," And quite frankly, I won't be in business long."
"6880420","6882640"," If regulators are only looking at capital."
"6883600","6884780"," I'm going to mute this real quick, too. "
"6884880","6885980"," I want to talk about something else."
"6887440","6890100"," So we're talking about business cycles, right?"
"6894710","6898770"," And I'll pass a couple of weeks here, and we're going to, or we'll pass week, I don't know, past"
"6898770","6904330"," week or two weeks that I'm not sure here, but I want to talk to you about business cycles, because"
"6904330","6906610"," I found it fat, so we know down the road."
"6907170","6908450"," Just keep this in the back of your mind. "
"6909150","6915630"," We know down the road that the next big one is going to be commercial backed real estate."
"6915910","6916690"," We already know, right?"
"6917030","6920310"," Commercial backed real estate will be the next one, but the Fed will have to backstop."
"6920310","6922290"," But I did find it fascinating. "
"6922510","6924030"," I was reading some stories this week."
"6924710","6927790"," As a matter of fact, let's look at a thing."
"6929560","6931440"," I'll show you something here in the background here. "
"6940530","6942510"," Look at Kroger just smashing."
"6954100","6964380"," Let me mute some stuff here, and we're going"
"6964380","6965140"," to look at KRE."
"6968260","6969040"," Regional banking. "
"6978250","6981170"," You can see the front running back here, right?"
"6981170","6982290"," You got a top here."
"6983730","6985230"," Looks kind of classic, right?"
"6985990","6989110"," Way back in November of 2022, right?"
"6990510","6991390"," Sell it down."
"6991570","6992010"," Sell it down. "
"6992110","6992650"," Sell it down."
"6992790","6993350"," Sell it down."
"6993550","6997970"," Need to create a reason to get some capitulation, right?"
"6999090","7000250"," We need a reason. "
"7000990","7001890"," Who sold this?"
"7002210","7003090"," Was that you and I?"
"7003230","7003830"," Probably not."
"7005910","7006430"," Right?"
"7006670","7009730"," You need a reason to sell this, right?"
"7009730","7013070"," You need a reason."
"7014590","7018810"," The reason I'm going to talk to you about this, the important part about this, this is KRE. "
"7021010","7023670"," And you can see XLF is similar, right?"
"7030290","7033530"," You get business cycle sector rotation."
"7034370","7044490"," We mute my business cycle"
"7044490","7046770"," sector rotation, right?"
"7048670","7049630"," There's financials."
"7053680","7054160"," Right?"
"7054400","7055260"," There's financials. "
"7055760","7057400"," And look, we got here, real estate."
"7058600","7060620"," So we know that this one is next, right?"
"7062040","7063480"," We know that one is next."
"7064680","7072180"," We also see the front running of tech first, then discretionary. "
"7074100","7080780"," But what's really fascinating for where we are right now currently is I'm already seeing"
"7080780","7088100"," discussions about steel in industrials and manufacturing."
"7088420","7090000"," I'm already seeing the discussion."
"7090860","7098200"," So you're already seeing the front running of the decline, the final decline of industrials. "
"7098500","7104640"," So that's boss's SVB was on notice that they needed to fix problems since November 2021, but they"
"7104640","7104980"," did not."
"7104980","7109980"," So right now you're hearing the discussion over right now, you're hearing the discussion over right"
"7109980","7115340"," now, like under the microscope is kind of becoming commercial real estate."
"7116100","7118020"," And you're going to begin to see. "
"7119300","7121040"," You're going to begin to see."
"7121700","7128660"," This is like right now, this past couple of weeks, you're going to begin to see a discussion over"
"7128660","7133980"," China in war, and you're going to see, hey, can we produce."
"7134840","7140460"," Stuff with steel, right, steel, think about to keep that in the back of your head, steel"
"7140460","7141380"," industrials manufacturing. "
"7142600","7148220"," This conversation is going to take place here and go under the microscope after."
"7150040","7153280"," After we get done with commercial real estate."
"7153800","7155860"," So just keep that in the back of your mind. "
"7159060","7164200"," So you'd see something like this, like where, you know, like instead of, you know, instead of"
"7164200","7169480"," waiting for all this to happen already and saying, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God."
"7169780","7172400"," I want you to start thinking about industrials."
"7173480","7178920"," As we head into the front running it and the front running of it that will take place. "
"7194160","7197640"," And I'm assuming you're going to hear hearings on this as well."
"7197640","7204100"," Down the road, you'll end up have, well, as soon as we're done with commercial real estate, you're"
"7204100","7207660"," going to then have what would be your next one."
"7207720","7212440"," I'm going to, I'm going to forewarn you after we get to commercial real estate. "
"7212660","7216280"," Your next one is going to be manufacturing right there."
"7216360","7217120"," There'll be your next one."
"7217480","7219940"," And so you're also going to see. "
"7222860","7223340"," Institutions."
"7225320","7228080"," That are going to preposition for this."
"7238440","7242800"," And they're going to be like, they're going to be like, I don't know what you're talking about. "
"7244620","7246960"," They're going to be like, I don't know what you're talking about."
"7248000","7250980"," What me who me worry, I don't know what you mean."
"7251720","7252640"," And let's look at. "
"7254000","7255520"," Let's look at XLI real quick."
"7258600","7259880"," This is down the road, right?"
"7259960","7260640"," It's not right now."
"7260860","7261840"," But let's look at XLI. "
"7262480","7263280"," It's not today."
"7265940","7267000"," Interesting though, huh?"
"7269670","7270290"," Look at that."
"7270390","7271790"," There's XLI way up here. "
"7272330","7273690"," Looks kind of familiar, doesn't it?"
"7274330","7276030"," Does that look kind of familiar to you?"
"7277310","7278990"," We're not there today, are we?"
"7279990","7282110"," But it does look kind of familiar, right?"
"7282870","7284290"," Does that look kind of familiar to you?"
"7285370","7286490"," There's XLI."
"7287910","7289970"," There's the peak at 105."
"7292350","7294810"," Was that 105, 60, 105, 70?"
"7295570","7298730"," Not today, but it's right, right?"
"7300630","7305530"," I'm going to bet you right now that there's a hedge fund in a bank somewhere going. "
"7306430","7307310"," Well, don't worry."
"7307450","7309530"," We got this one coming up or down the road."
"7310550","7317850"," And we're going to need to create an industrial crisis a few months from now, three, six months"
"7317850","7318550"," from now or so. "
"7318630","7319530"," Maybe it's middle of July."
"7319870","7321050"," Maybe it's winter."
"7321570","7323970"," Maybe it's September, October or something. "
"7327270","7330730"," And so your next one that's going to get a front run is XLI down the road."
"7331550","7333070"," And you're going to have a Senate hearing."
"7333930","7337170"," And they're probably going to talk about the threats from China and war with Taiwan. "
"7337170","7340070"," And can we get steel?"
"7340570","7341770"," Can we manufacture shit?"
"7343410","7344110"," Right here."
"7345650","7351110"," Probably the car industry, probably short some manufacturing somewhere over here down the road."
"7351810","7352790"," Maybe it's 2024. "
"7355630","7358290"," Somewhere in here you have a, maybe not the full collapse."
"7359250","7361390"," You have like the collapse in November or something."
"7361730","7364970"," And then you have the bloodbath in the beginning of the year, something like that. "
"7368820","7370500"," We didn't know it was coming."
"7371360","7375460"," Now we have to strengthen the USA manufacturing."
"7376560","7378520"," How did we not see this coming?"
"7382420","7385880"," Successful retest right now of the one in five minute. "
"7396020","7397980"," Because we're in a bottoming process."
"7399240","7402020"," We're in a business cycle bottoming process."
"7424050","7424810"," I'm serious. "
"7425210","7425610"," I'm not joking."
"7425910","7426970"," We'll come back to this video."
"7427370","7428850"," I'll come back to this video. "
"7429150","7430610"," Well, you remember that."
"7431050","7433170"," So the next one's commercial real estate."
"7433330","7434610"," They're not going to get real estate. "
"7435250","7438210"," They fucked this whole thing is fucked up from COVID."
"7439910","7443190"," Everybody's got like a zero, two percent, three percent loan."
"7444350","7444830"," The majority. "
"7446270","7447950"," Most fire house buyers right now."
"7448510","7449610"," They're all cash buyers."
"7451350","7459450"," The only people getting fucked here are young people or someone older that only now has some money"
"7459450","7460550"," to buy at a high rate. "
"7460950","7462150"," That's the only people getting fucked here."
"7462710","7464630"," It's going to take like three or five years."
"7464930","7468270"," Meanwhile, they're going to run through the business cycle while all this is going on. "
"7471880","7472500"," And you'll see it."
"7472540","7472960"," You'll see it."
"7473020","7475540"," As soon as we're done with commercial real estate, we're going to go into industrials. "
"7477500","7478840"," That's the next one."
"7480460","7488300"," So you've got some time."
"7488460","7495520"," You could probably put like a two years short on XLI on a high on a market high or something. "
"7495580","7497660"," And you'll say I called it."
"7498040","7499920"," That me, you'll be like, I called it."
"7500520","7502200"," I knew this was coming down the road. "
"7504700","7508220"," I don't know how the Senate didn't see it coming down the road."
"7512060","7512680"," Don't worry."
"7512740","7514720"," Banks are already planning on it coming down the road. "
"7515700","7527270"," Yeah, you"
"7527270","7528470"," want it's already been happened."
"7528470","7530210"," So commercial real estate's already happened."
"7530210","7539350"," Most of these companies just do a Google search for just do a Google search for commercial real"
"7539350","7542190"," estate stocks like the largest ones. "
"7542310","7546190"," And they're usually like the largest commercial real estate holders like New York City and shit."
"7547050","7549130"," And they've already been shorted to the depths of hell."
"7550070","7551410"," They're almost that bottom. "
"7551590","7552210"," They're pretty close."
"7552210","7554590"," They just need that last capitulation phase."
"7555190","7560210"," That's where I'm a bank and I take my last profit out and I rebuy that bottom again. "
"7561450","7564290"," They cycle into buying that real estate bottom."
"7564830","7566210"," You're going to see news."
"7567690","7571170"," That's going to tell you that the world is going to end. "
"7573410","7576170"," And that last little crash in commercial real estate."
"7576270","7581600"," They're going to go and buy that while you're trying to sell it."
"7596540","7597460"," I'm telling you. "
"7598400","7599460"," You can see it."
"7599560","7601340"," You can see it before it happens every time."
"7606880","7608060"," I just showed you XLA. "
"7608820","7612120"," Yeah, I guarantee that's what it's going to look like for XLA."
"7627360","7628400"," Just waiting for."
"7628840","7631280"," We're just sitting here waiting right now for some of these. "
"7634320","7637360"," Some of these lines underneath there to catch up to it."
"7639440","7643280"," Just all this is right here is spy resting bitchface right now."
"7644620","7650410"," Service and testimony today. "
"7651170","7653310"," Mr. Gruenberger, you're aware."
"7653710","7655450"," Are you not a back at the CEO?"
"7655970","7659850"," We need price to hold above this 39562 to remain valid."
"7660050","7661130"," You're also watching time. "
"7661830","7666110"," Coming into the hour now at 11.56. We got four more minutes for a new high here."
"7666870","7668950"," Get a high at 11.41 right here."
"7669110","7670810"," Want to see one more high if we can get it. "
"7670810","7673990"," We might have to come back down and retest down below here."
"7674030","7674870"," It's been 9562."
"7674870","7679370"," The bonuses literally hours before SVB collapsed. "
"7680290","7680810"," Yes."
"7682170","7690270"," Now, I believe we need to have an independent investigation into any criminal culpability."
"7690510","7691830"," You know, criminal culpability. "
"7691890","7698210"," How about a fucking prime bank in this case, but regardless of any like I'm not a fan of VCs,"
"7698210","7704070"," but if you're going to go after VCs or executives in these banks, like the regionals and the, would"
"7704070","7708890"," agree it's simply wrong for the CEO and top executives to profit."
"7709210","7709950"," Yeah, I think it's wrong."
"7709970","7713590"," Own mismanagement and then leave FDIC. "
"7713590","7717930"," If you're going to throw them under the bus, you might as well throw the stockholders under the bus"
"7717930","7719650"," to the prime bank."
"7720490","7728170"," Dodd-Frank provides clawback authority that applies to the biggest banks under the orderly"
"7728170","7729530"," liquidation authority."
"7729790","7738370"," But as I understand it, that authority does not apply to SVB bank. "
"7739030","7739890"," Am I right about that?"
"7740230","7741470"," That is correct, Senator."
"7741770","7743370"," Could I elaborate on that briefly?"
"7744290","7744830"," If you could briefly."
"7744830","7745770"," Very briefly. "
"7745910","7748350"," We do not have explicit clawback authority."
"7748750","7750250"," We do have an obligation."
"7750430","7752530"," Turning yellow right now from red to yellow. "
"7753190","7753710"," Rugpole."
"7753890","7757590"," By the board and management of the institution."
"7758250","7764910"," And we do have authorities to impose consequences, including civil money penalties, restitution and"
"7764910","7766930"," barring individuals from the business of banking. "
"7767290","7770350"," So we can get at some of the issues raised."
"7770890","7773190"," Martin is like we already took the banks from them."
"7775330","7777290"," Prime banks like we already rug pulled them. "
"7777430","7778050"," Don't worry about it."
"7778110","7779370"," We took them from everything they got."
"7779770","7781870"," We corporate rated regional banks. "
"7782410","7783650"," Well, I'm glad you raised that."
"7783730","7788870"," I heard your response earlier and Senator Kennedy, a member of this committee and I are working"
"7788870","7794150"," right now on bipartisan legislation to accomplish exactly what you said."
"7794290","7795370"," I hope we can introduce it. "
"7795550","7796210"," Hey, Mr. Warriors."
"7796390","7796670"," How are you?"
"7796810","7800930"," I know the chairman of the committee is interested as well in pursuing that."
"7800930","7808230"," And I asked Secretary Yellen in another hearing last week whether she and the Biden administration"
"7808230","7809690"," fully supported it. "
"7809870","7810790"," The answer was yes."
"7811610","7815670"," So I hope we can move forward on that piece as quickly as possible."
"7816290","7819970"," Because there does seem to be a hole in your authority. "
"7820350","7824750"," You have some authorities indicated, but there is a hole in that authority that we have to apply"
"7824750","7825550"," and you agree with."
"7825550","7828930"," We should have criminal penalties for these executive executives."
"7830830","7832150"," Vice chair bar. "
"7832670","7836850"," What about the criminal penalties for the bank executives and 07 and 08 guidance."
"7837550","7843190"," In fact, a rule that was issued by your predecessor, former vice chair supervision."
"7844110","7849190"," Quarles shortly before his departure in March, 2021. "
"7849190","7857370"," And this rule established that supervisory guidance does not have the force of law."
"7857830","7864010"," And it cannot be used in the event where it would halt bank's abilities to conduct mergers and"
"7864010","7865550"," acquisitions and that sort of thing."
"7866290","7870650"," I fully understand the distinction between supervisory guidance. "
"7871470","7876190"," Successful retest trying to retest the highs right now coming into the 12 o'clock hour half hour."
"7876770","7885770"," According to the feds staff memo that this guidance was issued upon industry request."
"7886930","7893210"," And they specifically know the bank policy institute and the American Bankers Association is"
"7893210","7899250"," submitting a petition asking for this rule to provide guidance. "
"7900150","7905190"," To try to weaken the punch of the supervisory rules."
"7905250","7905430"," Are you?"
"7905470","7908190"," I started above 396 72."
"7908550","7910050"," See if we can actually get up there or not. "
"7910170","7914090"," This goes into the frame that the chairman of the committee made earlier on."
"7914110","7915550"," 96.2. Excuse me."
"7915890","7919210"," That had been saying miss speaking there months and years. "
"7920270","7925810"," Let's rein in the bank supervisors and now all of a sudden it's like where were the supervisors?"
"7926130","7928330"," Why weren't they being more aggressive?"
"7928330","7937110"," Do you agree that that guidance putting that into rule sent a message that you don't have to listen"
"7937110","7939690"," to supervisors guidance that much?"
"7940050","7945090"," And would you be willing to take a look at whether or not that should be repealed?"
"7945890","7947990"," Senator I'm not sure of the"
"7947990","7958290"," impact"
"7958290","7958290"," of that."
"7959790","7964810"," I'd really like to see this be the end of the Senate hearing to get that squeeze in here."
"7965250","7969730"," Well, I hope you'll take a look at it because otherwise would be could be in a holding pattern"
"7969730","7973750"," until industry and clearly the intent was to. "
"7975070","7976350"," The hearing ends."
"7976530","7986250"," It seems to be part of a pattern of"
"7986250","7992670"," an effort to push back on regulators authority and then come back and do the Monday morning"
"7992670","7994210"," quarterback and saying where were they?"
"7994390","7994990"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"7996210","7997650"," Yeah, I don't think everyone hates. "
"7997810","7999750"," I think this guy is like."
"8001090","8005590"," He's like you know and I know and I know that you know that we're all making money off this."
"8008270","8010250"," It's like that the thieves are all together. "
"8011830","8015270"," He's like they're going to throw me into the polls and we're going to go do some cocaine later"
"8015270","8017610"," after this and rent some hookers at Davos together."
"8019070","8023150"," He's like I just banged a hooker and Davos this guy like six months ago and he called me up"
"8023150","8025030"," on the phone last night and told me I'm going to get grilled."
"8025030","8028290"," To our world could not be understated. "
"8028630","8031990"," So I am proud of the work they do and proud of the strength they continue."
"8033210","8037130"," Mr. Barr, I want to follow up on a question that one of my colleagues brought up."
"8037490","8041630"," You keep talking about the Fed focusing on the size of SBB and banks. "
"8042170","8049090"," However, 2155 also requires the Fed to take into consideration riskiness complexity financial"
"8049090","8050910"," activities along with other risk."
"8053170","8058510"," Mikey asin Mikey asin is saying how is Tesla chart in your opinion."
"8059430","8061150"," I am weekly long. "
"8061290","8064890"," Let's take a look at Tesla chart real quick."
"8065070","8068590"," I was so that you could tailor your regs and your supervision to risk."
"8069250","8075770"," So why did you not require definitive corrective action based on the flaws that you saw. "
"8075950","8077170"," When did you get long."
"8077910","8083110"," Thank you very much Senator Brett and I appreciate your comments about the Alabama banking sector"
"8083110","8087170"," which I think is a thriving sector and is contributing to its communities."
"8088270","8092170"," And like bankers across the country is strong and vibrant. "
"8092450","8096770"," IE we didn't raid your regional your community bank."
"8096950","8097530"," We just raided."
"8098130","8101310"," V.C. banks. "
"8101310","8105690"," So Mikey asin is saying how is the Tesla chart in your opinion."
"8105690","8106810"," I am in weekly long."
"8107850","8114010"," Well, when did you buy a did you buy on Monday or Tuesday long Mikey. "
"8114630","8118610"," If you're listening in on on Twitch there."

"8124770","8125230"," on YouTube."
"8125230","8127650"," Thank you for subscribing on YouTube. "
"8128210","8131650"," Will you take a look at if you use Mikey can you let me know."
"8132170","8133530"," To prevent this both."
"8134190","8135370"," Today at 200 C."
"8136330","8136970"," Okay, good. "
"8137130","8138230"," That's thanks for saying something here."
"8138290","8138690"," Hold on a second."
"8138770","8142410"," We'll take a look at it steps that supervisors took and whether they should have taken more"
"8142410","8143170"," aggressive action. "
"8143290","8148530"," So at current rate you can't speak to whether or not you utilized all of the powers that were given"
"8148530","8148950"," to you."
"8149730","8155090"," I really would like to wait for the formal review for the staff to come evaluate the full"
"8155090","8157130"," supervisory record to make the assessment."
"8157610","8159990"," But we're certainly very focused on that question. "
"8160290","8162150"," Let's look at Tesla."
"8162250","8163430"," We're going to say that."
"8163670","8163970"," Yes. "
"8164270","8168750"," I find it concerning though when you all were asked each one of you were asked."
"8169190","8173710"," Would you like to see more powers more strength every single one of you said yes."
"8173710","8177570"," When you don't actually know if you utilize the tools in your toolbox correctly. "
"8177950","8181430"," Or if the people that were under your supervision were supervising appropriately."
"8182290","8183570"," I think that's what people hate."
"8185010","8185670"," All right. "
"8185790","8186410"," Let's talk about Tesla."
"8186510","8187650"," Let's talk about a couple of things here."
"8187870","8190110"," So you're long Tesla right about weeklies. "
"8192850","8194490"," A few things here."
"8194889","8197590"," Tesla on a longer time frame this blue line right here."
"8198290","8202330"," This is where sellers come in or have been coming into sell Tesla right here. "
"8203209","8204730"," When price comes near it."
"8205530","8207770"," Sellers are coming into sell it."
"8207950","8210270"," They've been doing this now for quite some time. "
"8210830","8212590"," I'll show it to you in a higher time frame here."
"8227000","8231000"," I want you to see that the major downturn in Tesla came."
"8231940","8233879"," On a successful retest. "
"8235420","8238299"," Of this monthly trigger right blasted down."
"8239520","8241180"," I want you to see that right there."
"8241299","8241420"," Okay. "
"8241740","8243920"," So it's like a major move down for Tesla."
"8244660","8246160"," Price got underneath."
"8247980","8251379"," Got let me see and change the color of this price got underneath. "
"8254070","8255330"," The monthly trigger."
"8256350","8258549"," Confirm the move lower on the daily trigger."
"8259370","8262410"," And then made a major move down right pretty pretty severe. "
"8263830","8265709"," You see price now is above."
"8266709","8269490"," The daily right very positive trades above."
"8270049","8273209"," Comes back to the same place where shorts are above here. "
"8273209","8276469"," And the immediate reaction is sell right."
"8276870","8280090"," Expected we knew that we knew that we were actually in stream talking about it right."
"8280790","8282309"," I'm going to take profit up here. "
"8282709","8285850"," We expect sellers to come in at like two sixteen two twenty something like that."
"8286150","8287590"," I think they first came in at two fourteen."
"8288790","8291510"," I think you might have gotten high at two seventeen at one point. "
"8292290","8293170"," They're expecting that right."
"8293450","8294450"," That's the first sell down."
"8295170","8296530"," Here's your first sell down. "
"8298410","8302010"," And you're going to be looking for price to get underneath the daily."
"8303530","8305670"," Right to make that next move lower."
"8307450","8314650"," Or to squeeze up and confirm that move lower so overall they look for Tesla is bearish. "
"8316110","8321070"," It's bearish down to ninety five dollars and then I think it's fifty six or fifty two."
"8321650","8322969"," There's some gaps down there to fill."
"8324549","8327930"," So just just a base case right now for Tesla. "
"8328629","8329430"," Hold on."
"8330110","8331709"," A base case for Tesla."
"8332510","8335190"," Overall it's bearish on a higher time frame here. "
"8335510","8340430"," Now the one thing going for you is that price is above currently."
"8341930","8343150"," The daily trigger."
"8343530","8349490"," So if you're if you're like hey I'm long Tesla one eighty six ninety nine. "
"8351170","8357410"," Seems reasonable right now to be long here for a short weekly or day trade."
"8357410","8358730"," If friend is your friend."
"8359150","8363590"," But for trend to be your friend you will price also wants to be above the one minute five minute. "
"8364110","8365030"," In the early."
"8367549","8369290"," It is nice to see that."
"8370490","8374110"," It's still trending higher here right still haven't made new lows here. "
"8375150","8378330"," Right one two three looking for that squeeze higher here."
"8378330","8380250"," So I get that I get the idea here."
"8381230","8385629"," But the idea still at this point is you can't break trend right. "
"8385629","8387250"," So in a thirty minute."
"8388910","8389650"," Time frame."
"8391630","8395990"," And right now it's bearish so even today Tesla is bearish at the moment. "
"8396810","8400190"," So you don't want to break trend you already know that you don't need me to teach that."
"8400310","8402690"," I'll tell you that I want you to see that you've broken trend here."
"8403430","8407250"," Right you're very broken trend on Tesla and you don't want to get below. "
"8408350","8411830"," Or reject below the key here is that you don't want to reject below."
"8413070","8417290"," One eighty seven twenty four and I'm going to show you what that means right now so."
"8418690","8422330"," If you were to drop box at home at one on one twenty seven. "
"8424130","8428670"," Twenty four sorry not one twenty seven one eighty seven twenty four excuse me on that."
"8429870","8431110"," I'll just snap a line here."
"8431910","8432530"," Make it easy. "
"8437060","8439240"," If you want an abandoned ship kind of a moment."
"8443260","8448940"," One eighty seven twenty seven what you don't want to see here happen on Tesla is you don't want to"
"8448940","8450360"," see price break below."
"8451040","8453500"," And confirm the move lower. "
"8454500","8459240"," So if you see price break and it comes above one twenty seven twenty seven not so bad."
"8459460","8464660"," You still have some life left in and Tesla possibly going higher but you do what you don't ever"
"8464660","8465940"," want to see here on Tesla."
"8465940","8473540"," Is like the price break below and confirm that the move is lower here and you would see the moving"
"8473540","8475120"," averages come down as well. "
"8475380","8477100"," That would be the one in the five minutes."
"8477280","8481180"," So I'll draw this out for you here on a regular chart for you okay."
"8481600","8483740"," You'll want twenty one eighty seven twenty seven. "
"8484480","8486520"," We'll take a look at something else here for you in a moment."
"8488980","8490740"," So we'll we'll simplify it for you."
"8490900","8492920"," So Tesla if you had a chart at home or something. "
"8494740","8495140"," T."
"8495180","8495320"," S."
"8495480","8495480"," L."
"8495640","8495740"," A."
"8498560","8499960"," do a five minute chart here."
"8501280","8501920"," It's Tesla."
"8503480","8505100"," And you got one twenty seven. "
"8505220","8505700"," One eighty seven."
"8505840","8506780"," Keep saying one twenty seven."
"8506860","8507560"," It's one eighty seven. "
"8507720","8508720"," So just for today right."
"8509080","8511520"," This week one eighty seven twenty seven."
"8514900","8516280"," Snap a quick line right here. "
"8517620","8518680"," Make a nice and fat."
"8519580","8520480"," Something like that."
"8520800","8522040"," Pretty pretty simple way to do this. "
"8523420","8523860"," Right."
"8524100","8525400"," You have yourself an EMA."
"8527460","8529000"," You have yourself some EMA's. "
"8529080","8531760"," You got to think this is today is a twenty seven and a."
"8533620","8536120"," I think it's a one to one twenty nine right now."
"8538280","8542660"," These change but for right now what you're looking for if you're buying a weekly or something like"
"8542660","8542900"," that."
"8543360","8544900"," What you don't want to see is price. "
"8547580","8548320"," Get underneath."
"8549760","8550200"," Reject."
"8550200","8554080"," And you don't want to see. "
"8556960","8559820"," This come over and this come over violently."
"8562440","8565360"," Here like this okay because then you'll see price come down."
"8565580","8567240"," Now what you want to be looking for is a bull. "
"8567840","8569620"," You don't want to be seeing that right there right."
"8570120","8571980"," Comes down below and starts to reject."
"8572060","8572900"," We start to get a balance. "
"8573320","8577040"," It's kind of like your your your stops if you will."
"8578800","8582020"," It's okay if it comes down and then comes back up to this kind of stuff."
"8582160","8583500"," You don't want to see the rejection though. "
"8584220","8584900"," Right in here."
"8585220","8585980"," You don't want to see that."
"8586200","8590840"," Now the other thing you can look at using this would be do these flatten out or not. "
"8591580","8591880"," Right."
"8591980","8595180"," Does this white line flatten out or is it chase price lower."
"8596000","8598420"," If you start to see this white line chasing price lower. "
"8599300","8600560"," That's a bad sign right here."
"8600700","8602420"," If you if you see price go lower."
"8604540","8606780"," And this white line is flattening. "
"8607220","8609200"," It's an indication that it's going to come."
"8609380","8613980"," It's going to it's going to it's going to root or pull back higher here."
"8613980","8614220"," Okay. "
"8614300","8618120"," If you start to see these things flattening out these moving averages."
"8619480","8620660"," Flattening out like this."
"8621160","8623480"," You'd actually see price swing shot back up. "
"8623960","8627020"," And start it's it's it's move higher here."
"8627260","8629580"," Now we'll look at some higher time frames."
"8630280","8631100"," On Tesla. "
"8631460","8632180"," We're looking at an hourly."
"8633080","8634660"," Pretty pretty bearish here right."
"8635240","8636540"," Looks pretty bad on an hourly. "
"8637120","8639320"," It doesn't look healthy does it."
"8642360","8644520"," If you wanted to get bullish again."
"8645800","8648540"," You'd want to see this you'd want to see price come above this right. "
"8649440","8650620"," To get bullish on Tesla."
"8650940","8652380"," This is kind of where you take a bull trade."
"8652760","8654700"," So if you're already in a bull trade right now. "
"8654780","8656360"," I would say you know I don't like it."
"8656540","8657800"," I'm not a fan of it right here."
"8658500","8662840"," You're just kind of just trying to die by a dip out of nowhere like I'm calling bottom here. "
"8663540","8666140"," I don't like I always like to see the confirmation first."
"8667040","8670440"," To the meat of the trade is same thing for bears like this."
"8670560","8672200"," There is no bear trade here either for me. "
"8672860","8673780"," You'd want to see."
"8675100","8680180"," If you're a bear you'd want to see price get underneath and then confirm the move lower."
"8681100","8685000"," This is where the money shot is with the real money is in that and that trade is right here. "
"8685640","8687160"," Right here not right here."
"8688540","8690000"," Danger no danger here."
"8691060","8692100"," That's for the bear trade. "
"8692680","8694640"," Oh this is a good bear trade right here too."
"8695680","8699040"," But you'd be like take your money here or you'd take your money underneath."
"8700100","8704200"," If you're already in this trade bearish you'd take your money down here and then you'd look for"
"8704200","8706440"," this to take the second part of the trade. "
"8706660","8708920"," This is the second money shot of that trade for bears."
"8712120","8718240"," So in an early I'm not overly bullish on on on on Tesla here and just looking at Tesla here."
"8718340","8719620"," This looks bearish overall doesn't it. "
"8720020","8722180"," This all looks like it wants to go down lower."

"8848310","8851310"," healthy Apple how healthy and video healthy."
"8851930","8857910"," No bull cares about a dip it's just another opportunity to buy a dip Tesla on the other hand so"
"8857910","8859710"," far until it proves itself otherwise."
"8860150","8865490"," It's looking pretty fucking unhealthy right it's looking looking like it's looking like it's pretty"
"8865490","8866330"," rough right now. "
"8868450","8873910"," Right it's looking pretty rough you need like smart bowls by the retest smart bowls are going to"
"8873910","8875590"," wait for price on Tesla to come up."
"8876130","8882130"," Retest the weekly and have all these all these triggers underneath it trying to propel it forward"
"8882130","8885670"," so until we get there there's no real true like bull trade for Tesla."
"8886450","8892010"," So far Tesla is looking like it's it's rough it's it's got some damage done to it. "
"8894640","8897360"," It's looking like it wants to be reprised so far."
"8898520","8901800"," So Tesla tough tough call on Tesla right now."

"8947700","8951420"," Natural dip buyers the VIX here."
"8951420","8954440"," And you know the bears are going to want to buy this dip down here."
"8954520","8955720"," It's natural for them. "
"8956020","8958700"," Can the VIX roll over and Tesla go higher?"
"8959020","8959140"," Sure."
"8959960","8965760"," You're going to be looking for at least like VIX to break below 20 bucks right."
"8966160","8972460"," And successfully retest it before you even take along on Tesla you'd be looking for you know VIX to"
"8972460","8980020"," VIX to trade lower than 20 bucks and then successfully rejecting go lower to be taking along on"

"9044380","9045700"," 187.23 here. "
"9047000","9054420"," What's crazy is if you get a break of this in a hold or a confirmation it's just like straight"
"9054420","9055620"," down from there."
"9056920","9059480"," There's like blue sky like right here."
"9059780","9063360"," If you wanted to buy a dip this was the place to buy a dip on Tesla. "
"9063720","9067940"," And if they break below this like you buy this dip here and you put a stop underneath."
"9070100","9073260"," Put a stop right here you buy this dip on Tesla."
"9075700","9081040"," You might get one quick break underneath you might get one more blast through oftentimes on these"
"9081040","9081720"," these triggers. "
"9082020","9087460"," You'll see one last blast through you'll see sell side trying to get underneath and stay"
"9087460","9087820"," underneath."
"9089340","9092020"," To get much much lower lows in the market."
"9094200","9094760"," Right. "
"9095140","9099300"," This is what a sell side wants a hedge fund right now where we are currently at that right at"
"9099300","9099860"," this moment."
"9099860","9106660"," I mean I'd be taking profit here if I was a bear but a hedge fund a sell side wants"
"9106660","9107480"," to get underneath."
"9108920","9113940"," That's what they want to do get underneath hold underneath and creates take support and turn into"
"9113940","9114280"," resistance. "
"9115060","9116460"," That's what that's what a bear wants."
"9116640","9118200"," That's what a sell side hedge fund wants."
"9122660","9125460"," There's a one minute chart right here looking at a five minute chart. "
"9128650","9130830"," You can see where sellers are easily right."
"9131710","9132430"," They're right here."
"9132430","9133790"," They're right up here at one eighty eight. "
"9134950","9136430"," Sellers are right here at one eighty eight."
"9138070","9139850"," If you wanted to take along on Tesla."
"9141750","9143570"," You're going to be looking for this first. "
"9149010","9152270"," You're going to look for this flattening of the red line right."
"9152910","9157510"," You'll be looking looking for believe it or not flattening of these lines not these vertical scale"
"9157510","9158290"," vertical this is."
"9158850","9161910"," This is negative velocity to the downside right here. "
"9162530","9164530"," You want to see the white line flatten out."
"9165230","9167350"," Even if price is lower flat note."
"9168110","9169490"," You want to see this line come up. "
"9171170","9173750"," And then price if you saw this and price was lower."
"9174430","9178690"," You'd be expecting that that a squeeze higher here the flattening of this."
"9180010","9182430"," And then you'd want to see price. "
"9184430","9187670"," Actually make its way higher and then read successfully retest."
"9189070","9192610"," And this is where you enter you like set the trade up and you sit there and you wait for"
"9192610","9192870"," this."
"9193630","9198190"," Successful retest you slam the buy button and we're going north right here on Tesla. "
"9200110","9205110"," Now right here just looking at this chart right here some pretty mean velocity down here right."
"9205750","9209450"," Well look at this line look at the verticalness of this line look at how violent this line is"
"9209450","9210170"," coming down here."
"9210910","9213390"," So do I think it's done going down probably not. "
"9214730","9220970"," Not with the how vertical this line is even if this takes some time to trade around here and"
"9220970","9222150"," flatten this line out."
"9222970","9228070"," You know flatten this white line out that would signal an end to the downside move on Tesla."
"9229390","9232650"," So all the signs are still pointing to bearishness there. "
"9233450","9239030"," I'm not seeing like one to adding like one two three four up and that we're going up here on"
"9239030","9239350"," Tesla."
"9241110","9246430"," And I'm a Tesla bull by the way if you're just joining me on on Twitch I'm a Tesla bull"
"9246430","9248610"," so don't I'll never lie to you always tell you the truth."
"9253530","9255110"," I won't sugar coat. "
"9255750","9257630"," I won't sugar coat for you."
"9259790","9264350"," Tesla I'm a Tesla bull but I'm not a Tesla Kool-Aid drinker."
"9281370","9283990"," Just waiting now for the Senate hearing to end. "
"9284190","9288410"," According to the record to the to the CFO of the firm in October."
"9288830","9291390"," Key here this this afternoon is going to be."
"9292550","9297790"," You want these people to break for lunch and cocaine snorting and hooker buying or something"
"9297790","9299430"," senators and bankers. "
"9307750","9313970"," Oftentimes when these Senate hearings end you might see a quick capitulation down for a hedge fund"
"9313970","9314890"," to get what they want."
"9315630","9317670"," And then we'll make that move higher too so be careful in here."
"9318430","9321330"," Like a sideways movement until the hearing ends. "
"9322830","9328410"," I just be prepared to buy a dip to squeeze higher once once this hearing ends this afternoon."
"9330790","9336290"," So your testimony says that asset signs is not necessarily an indicator of complexity and I agree"
"9336290","9343830"," which is why section 401 of S 21 55 gives the Fed explicit authority to impose the regulations and"
"9343830","9344350"," enhance supervision."
"9344490","9345850"," Kind of sex on Tesla right. "
"9346750","9351450"," And you can do that on any bank between a hundred and two hundred fifty billion assets like SUV."
"9352010","9356410"," The Fed is given his authority to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the U.S."
"9357130","9358890"," We both agree that this is existing."
"9358970","9360450"," Yeah no worries Mike I got your brother. "
"9360550","9363810"," Since the enactment of S 21 55 and 22."
"9364190","9365030"," No worries I got you."
"9365410","9368250"," Yes the Fed has broad authority to. "
"9368330","9370130"," And I love trading Tesla man I got you."
"9370130","9376130"," Like different approaches to supervision of firms under the rules that were put in place in 2019."
"9376790","9378250"," The firm was bucketed. "
"9378870","9380090"," How about BTC."
"9380910","9382770"," Yeah I didn't cover that yet did I."
"9382870","9385630"," As I have been doing since arriving at the Federal Reserve."
"9385870","9390690"," So I was talking to a friend last night and he was like I'm short Bitcoin. "
"9391850","9394710"," And I was like well you really can't be short Bitcoin yet."
"9395550","9399570"," He's like well he's like I've got a he's like I've got a very small window of."
"9400090","9402890"," He's like he's like get a squeeze out of my short. "
"9403210","9405990"," And I was like yeah you can't because you can't do that just yet."
"9407550","9413390"," Based on the current supervisory record it looked like the escalations that occurred were in the"
"9413390","9419870"," format of MRAs and sorry matters applying attention and matter of applying immediate attention."
"9420670","9423450"," And the supervisors also put in place. "
"9423790","9426050"," You know how Bitcoin bears are."
"9426610","9428350"," Bitcoin bears are almost as bad."
"9428690","9429550"," This is my buddy too. "
"9430410","9432970"," I'm breaking his balls right now if he's listening in."
"9433410","9439770"," Thank you Mr. Chair thank you all for being here."
"9440530","9442070"," Let's look at a Bitcoin really quick. "
"9442070","9444550"," I want to start maybe with a question that."
"9446210","9450430"," Sorry cash market bulls or futures globe x traders."
"9450770","9452910"," We're going to do a little bit of Bitcoin it's. "
"9454870","9457330"," Traditional requirements that I hear that correctly."
"9458330","9459270"," So Bitcoin."
"9459910","9461290"," For us to strengthen capital. "
"9461890","9462790"," 30 minutes chart."
"9463930","9465250"," Really a spectrum."
"9466430","9469430"," Is there any of the tools that are just going back. "
"9469430","9473970"," You guys want the does the matter with you what we I can do any Bitcoin chart you want."
"9474110","9476890"," You tell me the Bitcoin chart you want and we can do it."
"9479090","9480630"," We can do BCC. "
"9481630","9484950"," Tether US dollar tether you have a preference maybe."
"9491990","9495450"," You guys like you guys you USD tether maybe."
"9495450","9498550"," Tether a lot of questions that I will get them done on time. "
"9498730","9499130"," Binance."
"9500110","9501210"," Do you finance."
"9502190","9503590"," The 2019. "
"9505610","9507990"," We're right here is already started this out."
"9507990","9515390"," 21.55. I'm inferring that bucket at Silicon Valley and a certain regulatory resume."
"9516110","9521770"," Did that mean that it restricted yet from having supervisors make the judgment that the additional"
"9521770","9523270"," that the increase. "
"9523750","9527810"," What I had said to him last night was you want to see a successful."
"9528510","9531350"," You want to see a successful rejection above."
"9533850","9536690"," Before you short it and we got it last night. "
"9536690","9539930"," I think this was last night in the middle of the night."
"9540470","9542790"," You got the successful rejection above here."
"9543490","9547730"," So that is leading the process to lower lows on Bitcoin. "
"9550070","9551590"," I like this so far."
"9551850","9553590"," I like this short above here."
"9553790","9557110"," I told him last night you're going to look for that hourly check and we got it last night. "
"9557770","9560110"," That was up at 27 200 or so."
"9560270","9562150"," You got in the middle of the night."
"9562850","9567030"," So if you're short Bitcoin here if you're short Bitcoin right now last night if you're a matter of"
"9567030","9568730"," fact if you're if you're watching in the background. "
"9569690","9572810"," If you're the person I was speaking to last night you're short from right here."
"9572910","9573730"," You're good to go short."
"9574630","9575710"," The play is dead. "
"9579330","9585410"," The cover for this short is 2709304."
"9588090","9590150"," The short was last night I believe."
"9590370","9594110"," It was like a last night and no it was this morning at eight o'clock. "
"9594230","9595250"," I said last night was this morning."
"9595530","9599130"," It was at eight a.m. I get the wrong ticker but it was at eight a.m. This morning"
"9599130","9600270"," I texted him this morning too."
"9600430","9601750"," I was like eight a.m. It happened. "
"9603090","9605890"," So you get an eight a.m. the short on on Bitcoin."
"9606690","9612770"," You'd be looking for lower lows on Bitcoin and that path goes pretty low."
"9612870","9619490"," You're talking about a target down below of twenty five currently twenty five. "
"9620010","9625690"," Probably eight hundred twenty five eight hundred and then you have another target down below here"
"9625690","9626750"," at twenty three hundred."
"9627730","9629130"," Overall bearish on Bitcoin."
"9631890","9636730"," Any kind of a successful this could take some time to. "
"9637330","9642630"," Unless there's a successful dip by the one thing that one thing I have about Bitcoin that bothers"
"9642630","9643110"," me here."
"9644570","9650970"," Is that these buyers are stepping in like nobody's business down here."
"9651670","9654570"," So if you see any of this kind of like supportive buying. "
"9654970","9657510"," I'm not going to not expect it at this point."
"9658290","9661010"," I'm bearish on Bitcoin but not fully bearish on Bitcoin."
"9661470","9664810"," I'm more like yeah this is looking like dip buying action. "
"9665570","9667790"," And his take is that we're going to crash Bitcoin."
"9669250","9670990"," The crash on Bitcoin."
"9673230","9678830"," Is a successful defense of twenty two eight seventy. "
"9680290","9682750"," You can see there was no successful defense."
"9683810","9687070"," Back here and so you would have wanted to have seen price get underneath."
"9687930","9689010"," And then a rejection. "
"9689490","9692590"," If you saw that rejection this would be this would be like market crash."
"9693210","9694110"," Stock market is going to crash."
"9695690","9700510"," So even my overall bearish is some Bitcoin showing that there it was in a supportive environment. "
"9701770","9703410"," There's a demand here."
"9703410","9709010"," You're likely going to find demand here at twenty five sixty two four six five."
"9709390","9714410"," You're likely going to find demand down below here in the low at twenty three oh two four forty"
"9714410","9714700"," four. "
"9715650","9717950"," So Bitcoin overall supportive."
"9719650","9721370"," But bearish in the short term."
"9722330","9728110"," My bearishness on it is maybe maybe a move down at twenty five sixty seven sixty five something"
"9728110","9728610"," like that. "
"9730190","9734310"," And you're going to you're going to probably see demand step in and squeeze this higher."
"9734730","9735930"," So come down here."
"9736950","9737830"," Consolidation sideways. "
"9738970","9740190"," Then you get to move higher."
"9740610","9742370"," Worst case scenario down here to."
"9744510","9747310"," Twenty two eight six nine seven four. "
"9748350","9750010"," This is what I'd like to buy down here."
"9750190","9752630"," The preference is to buy that."
"9753790","9757310"," With a stop underneath if it if it if it breaks below and rejects. "
"9758430","9762250"," There is something scary here though and this is what he was talking about."
"9763850","9768130"," Was this is daily velocity and it is starting to peak here so."
"9769350","9771590"," When you see this daily velocity peaking. "
"9772510","9777830"," I don't want to see this happen because this would lead not don't want to but this would lead to"
"9777830","9780690"," twenty two eight six nine down here."
"9781810","9783950"," And then expect that dip to be bought here."
"9785050","9789170"," And then it would roll higher and you'd actually get higher prices on Bitcoin. "
"9791270","9793950"," So into the into the beginning of the next month."
"9793950","9798450"," In the beginning of next month I expect Bitcoin to be weak in the beginning of next month."
"9798550","9799990"," I'm going to expect the market to be weak. "
"9803810","9804610"," On Bitcoin."
"9804610","9810210"," Sure had to be known months before the chickens came home to roost."
"9810550","9812970"," And I wish that we could just focus on that problem. "
"9813630","9817130"," Weakness in the spy right now down we're trying to retest the new low."
"9817330","9821270"," See if the bears can get down here and catch a new low if not."
"9821750","9823790"," We'll find out if the market is supportive here. "
"9824490","9826610"," I don't care how you feel about regulatory tailing."
"9827690","9830130"," But use a ballot argument to fight against it."
"9830210","9832690"," Do not use Silicon Valley bank as an example. "
"9832690","9834230"," Not suggesting that you have."
"9834670","9839010"," But there are many people that sit up here who have had the expense of looking at how we can"
"9839010","9839970"," prevent this in the future."
"9840530","9842470"," And I do have questions for the record that I'll submit. "
"9842750","9843170"," Thank you all."
"9843650","9844550"," Thank you Senator."
"9844750","9848130"," Thank all the free of you for your testimony and your public service. "
"9848850","9851490"," I look forward to the reviews on these bank failures."
"9851710","9854630"," And thank you for helping start that process."
"9854870","9855210"," It's interesting. "
"9855570","9859590"," Many of my Republican colleagues are now so eager for bank regulators to crack."
"9860410","9862730"," Taking on too many risks."
"9862730","9863830"," I hope they remember that one. "
"9863910","9868430"," It comes time to empower a lot of leaders in strength and guardrails, including protecting"
"9868430","9871350"," independent funding of financial regulators."
"9871710","9873090"," The events of last month."
"9873330","9878090"," It's so why we need independent regulators funding and stability for all of our financial"
"9878090","9878870"," watchdogs. "
"9879450","9885470"," But now it's in court considers whether the CFPB's independent funding is constitutional."
"9885470","9891710"," He's independent to watch dogs ability to keep our financial system stable faces and an existential"
"9891710","9892490"," threat."
"9892830","9899350"," US financial regulators as we know are independently funded so they can quickly respond when crises"
"9899350","9899970"," happen. "
"9900430","9905750"," On this and every issue I'll continue to fight to protect America and workers from Wall Street"
"9905750","9906530"," arrogance and greed."
"9907370","9908630"," Thank you for joining us."
"9910030","9912670"," So here we should see a nice squeeze here. "
"9916070","9919750"," The Senate banking committee hearing on SBB has ended."
"9921310","9923570"," Do I think that you cut loose?"
"9924710","9927910"," I think you cut loose commercial real estate."
"9934020","9935120"," Not necessarily. "
"9935960","9937860"," I'm a believer winky that."
"9938900","9940360"," I'm a believer in."
"9940660","9942020"," I have to be honest with you, man. "
"9942120","9943000"," I'm a believer in."
"9944700","9947700"," There's a couple of thoughts here."
"9951590","9952750"," I'm a believer in. "
"9952950","9955970"," We'll look at some of these commercial real estate ETFs."
"9956510","9958030"," I'm a believer in two things, winky."
"9958210","9962670"," I'm a believer that being too bearish, you might miss a bottom. "
"9963250","9964210"," I'm a believer in D."
"9964370","9966630"," So let's start a baseline here."
"9967910","9974430"," I'm not a believer in DCAing highs of any stock or ETF or ETN."
"9974430","9975530"," I'm not a believer in that. "
"9975630","9976590"," I'm not a believer in like."
"9977150","9979330"," I'll hear people say I buy the highs."
"9979510","9980150"," I buy the lows. "
"9980370","9981010"," I buy the middles."
"9981230","9982070"," I just buy it all."
"9983070","9984450"," I'm not a believer in that. "
"9985970","9989430"," But on bottoms, I do believe in DCAing."
"9990090","9993430"," When you have major moves down in an ETF, ETN or stock."
"9994110","9994470"," Anything. "
"9995370","9997590"," I do like seen like I agree with that."
"9997690","9998830"," Like I agree with that process."
"9998830","10002050"," If you're like, I'm going to start buying these dips on. "
"10002050","10002150"," On."
"10003690","10005270"," On these stocks, right?"
"10006030","10008090"," I believe in that aspect of."
"10008410","10009510"," Of doing that. "
"10009690","10009850"," So."
"10011330","10012510"," If you're thought if you're."
"10012930","10013530"," If you're. "
"10014230","10018030"," If your thesis is paid sold off, which a lot of these have."
"10019350","10020470"," And there's other."
"10021090","10022430"," I should say it's multi fold. "
"10022910","10023230"," It's."
"10024590","10027530"," Do I want to start adding and what's my time frame?"
"10027810","10029370"," I think time frame is another key point here."
"10030230","10034830"," And how much do I how much percentage do I lend to this. "
"10035290","10037750"," And what's my time my timeline."
"10038070","10039310"," So let's look at."
"10041010","10041930"," We'll look at a few. "
"10042110","10042710"," We'll look at me."
"10042870","10044490"," Look up a VNQ."
"10054000","10055960"," So we he's asking a good question here. "
"10056060","10056240"," So."
"10059980","10060260"," Let's do."
"10061240","10062260"," Let's do a couple different. "
"10062440","10063380"," Let's do look at VNQ."
"10065620","10067080"," Senate hearing is over now."
"10068060","10069300"," Risk is off the market. "
"10070000","10071980"," Law are hedge fund should pull."
"10074580","10077020"," Hedges are like major hedging off the market right now."
"10077540","10078320"," So VNQ. "
"10079340","10081900"," Is a Vanguard real estate ETF."
"10083040","10084640"," It's like on a daily chart on it."
"10092460","10095740"," And let's just look at the accumulation distribution of it. "
"10098340","10099400"," It's close right."
"10101220","10105360"," And there's a few things you need to realize here is you've got the accumulation of it right."
"10108900","10112280"," Right big nice blast higher trade it all up to a hundred and eleven bucks. "
"10112300","10114460"," Does this look familiar to industrials right."
"10114740","10118460"," Does this look familiar to financials right."
"10119360","10122940"," And it probably wants that one last capitulation move. "
"10124340","10129680"," Probably wants they'll create a reason for this last capitulation move."
"10129880","10130680"," Now with that said."
"10131920","10136260"," If you are trying to buy a bottom on commercial real estate. "
"10136880","10140120"," It doesn't mean you can't do a taste for ten or fifteen percent."
"10140540","10143780"," Another taste of fifteen percent down here right."
"10144440","10145620"," Like a capitulation move. "
"10146080","10148560"," Maybe there's like one more moment of blood down here."
"10149080","10150860"," Save another ten percent down here."
"10151460","10153480"," If this is the the end. "
"10154860","10157220"," There's nothing saying you can't add some more up here."
"10158420","10158680"," Right."
"10159760","10162300"," And you don't need to catch the exact bottom. "
"10162300","10167040"," If you say if you say to me I'm going to buy a 111 bucks and forty cents."
"10167240","10168420"," I'd be like you're smoking crack."
"10169420","10171540"," You're not DC aing up here. "
"10172220","10178460"," You can already see the the the the path of of these ETFs right path they take."
"10179760","10185300"," So do I think I think do I think that BNQ is done with sure shit looks a lot like"
"10185300","10186800"," XLF right or right."
"10186800","10193180"," Like sorry or shit the KRE where there could be that last capitulation move. "
"10194640","10195200"," VNQ."
"10197040","10199520"," Let's look to see if we can find anything in a weekly."
"10200820","10201840"," Look at that shocker. "
"10203400","10208340"," And what do we see in a weekly chart whole big giant ass gap down below."
"10209200","10212860"," Look what pops up down here big ass giant gap down here."
"10214240","10218580"," We left a gap behind the last bull run we had. "
"10219160","10224180"," It's down here at 68 and 66 76."
"10226140","10228400"," How much you want to bet we get out there and fill that gap."
"10229820","10232980"," I'm going to I'm going to almost bet that we fill this gap down here. "
"10234700","10239560"," At some point this year we fill that gap right there."
"10240260","10244200"," But I don't think it's a bad thing to be like now let's say we don't let's say I'm wrong."
"10244260","10246440"," At least you had some skin in the game right here. "
"10248020","10252520"," So I think I think this matters your time and then the last part I would say to you is"
"10252520","10252720"," that."
"10253360","10255660"," If you're looking for immediate like yeah."
"10257320","10259580"," VNQ is going to rip faces probably not. "
"10261560","10267360"," Probably see it come down here consolidate maybe one quick blast down one time blast up."
"10267360","10270540"," Make some money me you can make some money and like this will be money for you."
"10270760","10274180"," But if you're looking for that next run in VNQ it's probably not for some time. "
"10275120","10278520"," But I like the idea of buying dips down here me your front running it."
"10279620","10282720"," You are front running that those dips in VNQ."
"10283760","10288120"," And this is kind of like you know it's kind of like you kind of like matches up with it"
"10288120","10288960"," getting clipped next. "
"10290560","10294540"," Does that work for VNQ if you want to see a VNQ."
"10296220","10298380"," I think that's up you want to do X salary."
"10298720","10300680"," I'm assuming it's pretty close. "
"10304670","10307830"," Yeah yeah same thing boom this is X salary and shocker."
"10308990","10310230"," There's the gap down below."
"10311730","10316470"," That doesn't mean that X salary doesn't squeeze up here to 38 bucks and then comes down here. "
"10316630","10318170"," 26 the minister says."
"10318990","10322990"," You know but I mean if you're looking for that like long term 10 year 20 year cycle."
"10324810","10328810"," You know I feel like you're not going to call me in 10 years and say thanks for telling me"
"10328810","10329610"," to buy 30 bucks. "
"10331330","10334050"," Sure call me back in 10 years man right down there."
"10338850","10340830"," We'll look at a X salary."
"10345900","10347420"," It's looking pretty fucking bearish. "
"10355950","10358430"," The daily doesn't look bearish here in X salary."
"10358810","10361050"," I'm going to bet that X salary comes up."
"10363480","10366740"," This looks pretty bullish here on the short term. "
"10367700","10369940"," So like if X salary comes up here."
"10371880","10373520"," Maybe you don't cut right now."
"10374640","10376780"," Maybe you cut at 36 flat. "
"10378320","10383060"," Or this comes down here and it sells squeezes one more time higher and then it starts to make its"
"10383060","10383420"," way down."
"10384340","10390880"," So it could it could come up here but on my point here is that you're still looking for a"
"10390880","10391940"," low."
"10393900","10395400"," We'll look at one more thing here too. "
"10395540","10397020"," I'm going to show you some other thing here in the background."
"10397360","10398200"," Switch this up."
"10407050","10409190"," Think tight here for a minute I guess something else here for you. "
"10417200","10417900"," X salary."
"10429760","10432140"," This is on a higher time frame for X salary."
"10433400","10436300"," What I don't like about this is X salary. "
"10437340","10438620"," This is a higher time frame."
"10440220","10442080"," Though price is not showing it."
"10449020","10451300"," This is monthly right here. "
"10457700","10459240"," This is monthly right here."
"10459300","10462560"," I want to show you something that you can't see in price right now and this is right here."
"10465120","10468440"," This is what this little tick down below right here. "
"10468480","10474820"," This is showing you that on higher time frames the move is down."
"10475900","10479980"," This is I believe this is monthly right here."
"10480460","10481660"," Monthly velocity is leaving. "
"10483420","10486060"," When you start to see that over time frames."
"10486340","10493900"," I want you to see this right here."
"10495540","10498580"," This is back in 2020 right here. "
"10499500","10501640"," I want you to see right there."
"10504200","10505800"," You can see it already starting."
"10506760","10508860"," This is where the last leg is for X salary. "
"10509780","10513680"," As we haven't even gotten there yet and you're going to see it or you're seeing it develop right"
"10513680","10513960"," now."
"10516280","10520340"," Just be careful of X salary having that last leg down."
"10522200","10523220"," There's X salary. "
"10524160","10529820"," Maybe bullish briefly but overall rug pull ahead for X salary."
"10554230","10555670"," Does that help at all or no?"
"10557810","10563870"," You could get like a trade to 36 bucks or something in X salary but the overall trend is down"
"10563870","10564470"," over time."
"10565350","10566690"," You know sometime this year. "
"10567890","10569310"," Whenever they pull that rug."
"10571250","10576130"," The other thing saying that too is with XLF crashing spy didn't did it."
"10577250","10582390"," You could see spies continue to trade sideways and see X salary like blast down. "
"10584170","10587030"," You might not see spy actually capitulate."
"10587350","10595010"," You could see like the fed just laugh at these bears and watch spy just trade sideways down every"
"10595010","10596810"," sector one at a time."
"10610630","10611690"," I don't know maybe put up. "
"10611850","10614410"," I haven't looked at what are you in right now."
"10617720","10618920"," You're in BX."
"10622690","10624030"," You're in blackstone dude. "
"10624210","10625290"," I fucking love blackstone."
"10627210","10627930"," I do."
"10631570","10633110"," Blackstone's not quite there yet. "
"10639360","10640480"," Still bearish though."
"10641300","10642440"," Same setup bro."
"10645800","10652120"," Matter of fact blackstone's looking more more downside risk than the others. "
"10653680","10655220"," Like blackstone specifically."
"10657000","10660660"," Is there a when is the when is the blackstone."
"10663200","10670460"," When is the blackstone don't they have like a you can't withdraw money window coming up here soon. "
"10671700","10672180"," That's lifting."
"10674200","10678700"," Isn't it like a blackout window for removing money from blackstone coming up."
"10684470","10690130"," Blackstone looks more dangerous than than the ones I'm looking. "
"10697110","10701190"," Blackstone's looking more bearish than the indexes specifically."
"10703970","10704490"," Alexa."
"10705390","10706810"," Alexa is over here going crazy. "
"10706810","10707430"," Hold on a second."
"10712570","10713470"," I'm gonna unplug her."
"10719030","10720630"," Blackstone's looking more. "
"10722690","10725610"," We weaker than as an individual ticker."
"10726470","10729250"," Do I think you should select you know I can't give you that advice."
"10761570","10765110"," It's got two small gaps one at 70 and one at $50. "
"10765810","10769650"," It's got a gap at 70 and a gap at 50."
"10769930","10771670"," They have a failure to close a gap at 70 bucks."
"10772970","10778110"," Just barely didn't close the entire gap at 70 but it's got another gap down below 50 bucks if you"
"10778110","10778870"," want to own. "
"10780350","10783330"," If you want to add oh thanks for all the subscriptions."
"10784690","10786630"," I appreciate all the subscriptions out there."
"10787310","10790750"," If you want to own it at 80 and 50 or 30 and 50. "
"10792050","10793210"," Hang tight on it man."
"10799460","10803800"," I would suspect that it's going to close the gap at 50."
"10804940","10806640"," Definitely closing the gap at 70. "
"10807420","10813000"," And maybe that would be the moment that might be a good ticker winky to watch."
"10813460","10816600"," If we crash if we break below that 70 bucks."
"10817780","10819900"," And reject 70 to go down to 50. "
"10820160","10823380"," That would be a pretty ugly move for the market to go down."
"10834050","10837350"," Winky gifted a sub tier one to Devin."
"10837990","10842850"," He also gifted us a sub tier one to Ted Lee. "
"10843610","10844210"," Tadelli."

"11160490","11163690"," What I'm looking for or what I'm looking for this week here is. "
"11164350","11166170"," Into Friday and to end a month and a quarter."
"11166810","11167930"," I'm looking for sideways."
"11169750","11175690"," And squeezing into that supply that's above it for 10. "
"11176190","11177230"," That's not looking for."
"11177470","11180910"," I don't see what maybe it's there."
"11181950","11185410"," Maybe maybe a bear gets 3600 by Friday. "
"11186090","11187430"," I guess anything is possible."

"11205750","11208250"," So I got no time for it or them."
"11208510","11212710"," As a matter of fact I'm going to bet not that but at this point depending upon how the market"
"11212710","11214530"," is structured heading into the 31st. "
"11214930","11216910"," It could open up that downside move."
"11217770","11220190"," However the options market is priced."
"11220950","11223110"," I would like open the door to go lower. "
"11224110","11226690"," After the 31st after all this shit burns off."
"11228450","11232830"," But I'm still waiting for major positioning for I'm waiting for JPM caller."
"11233090","11233990"," I want to see what they're saying. "
"11234930","11239590"," I want to see what banks are going to do for the next quarter to make a decision as to"
"11239590","11240070"," where we're going."
"11241930","11244190"," Maybe a bank gets it."
"11244190","11247890"," Maybe if we crash 300 points by the 31st. "
"11248250","11249930"," To me I look at that as a positive."
"11250130","11251410"," If you want to do it the next three days."
"11251910","11253850"," Something like that today tomorrow Friday. "
"11254410","11256590"," Can you give me a kickass dip to buy down there."
"11256810","11258270"," Sweet bring it on."

"11268470","11269350"," And just let it burn."
"11270110","11272270"," I guess if you're out there trying to say that we're going to crash. "
"11272950","11276670"," Into Friday I don't know buy some five cent fucking puts for Friday."
"11278230","11281390"," You guys burned five cents I burned five cents all the time so."
"11281930","11284490"," I guess you could like claim that as a winner something. "
"11286370","11289590"," I don't think that the you get to wait for the options market to."
"11290930","11291410"," Unclench."
"11292670","11295170"," After the first after the 31st right. "
"11295870","11300670"," So you can see it you can see the the positioning for the next quarter."
"11301610","11303590"," My expectation would be after the first."
"11304070","11309030"," My expectation for this week is we trade sideways and we're going to squeeze up into supply. "
"11310090","11311610"," For people to close positions."
"11313110","11318350"," You'll also see on those highs hedging come into the market into the 31st."
"11319110","11324590"," And then after the first you'll see probably a good chance of some downside moves. "
"11326070","11327670"," At least for the first couple weeks."
"11330610","11331810"," That's what I expect at least."

"11410960","11413240"," The win issue does come out at the top of the hour. "
"11413900","11417800"," There's people out there that are expecting like a 300 point move down into Friday."
"11417800","11418640"," So I don't know."
"11419820","11423620"," I don't know what to say to that I take that as a gift if that happens. "
"11427280","11431600"," I don't maybe I guess I guess it's pie anything's possible."

"11665220","11667720"," That's a characteristic of a healthiest market."
"11668640","11674760"," Like you're hedging the market and the market just continues high higher unless we have a material"
"11674760","11678340"," event that sends the market down to twenty eight hundred right."

"13898030","13900010"," Sixty four for thirty six currently."
"13900710","13906950"," But I think it'd be like fifty for forty maybe down here fifty for forty bucks down here I might"
"13906950","13907370"," take them."
"13908350","13910250"," We'll see if this continues to the downside. "
"13910830","13915350"," If there's any squeezing or something I'll jump back in puts but I feel like I'm late to the game"
"13915350","13915870"," on this one."
"13928600","13931720"," Is JPM call are considered a magnet or a target."
"13932040","13936220"," It's kind of weird it acts as both and not only that the three sixty. "
"13936740","13939500"," It's like the thirty six I think it's thirty six hundred."
"13939940","13942460"," That acts as a magnet to lower prices."
"13944760","13950560"," But there's a bunch of supply above that four ten so just that supply sitting there I'm like yeah"
"13950560","13952720"," we're probably going to fucking squeeze up there at some point. "
"13953620","13959260"," I don't think that supply would be sitting there like when you see supply that high it hasn't been"
"13959260","13959960"," tagged yet."
"13960180","13963480"," So that's why I'm like yeah we could easily trade for ten no problem."
"13967080","13972520"," It's like thirty six hundred is a magnet to the downside but it's not like it's not like. "
"13974420","13979680"," It's like a magnet that's far away from metal it's not close enough to really do a big like huge"
"13979680","13981300"," face ripper down there."
"13985960","13989560"," I think the implied move for today to is three ninety five."
"13989560","13991460"," What am I looking at SPX real quick. "
"13992600","13993800"," Let me take a look at SPX."

"14006840","14008500"," We're getting a little long in the two."
"14008660","14012060"," I want to see if we can get down here though we can tag this PT to at least."
"14012760","14017930"," I think I got this right. "
"14018210","14018410"," Let me look."
"14018410","14019070"," Make sure."
"14032530","14042960"," Yeah the implied move for today's"
"14042960","14045740"," expire in the low is three ninety two eighty two. "
"14047520","14049900"," Three ninety two eighty two somewhere down in here."
"14051600","14054920"," But that doesn't that doesn't account for."
"14057220","14060460"," Implied volatility like zero dates in the market either. "
"14061020","14064440"," So this is kind of like I just start heading down here."
"14064920","14066940"," They come up here and slam down here."
"14067420","14069240"," Kind of like a not a bad idea to. "
"14072710","14075410"," You buy like the put spreads we talked about the other day."
"14075930","14080110"," Now as we start to print these yesterday and today we're looking for to like catch the other side"
"14080110","14080990"," of this trade down here."
"14082650","14086930"," And on the 30th first we've got three ninety nine eighty two. "
"14088550","14090670"," As an upside target for Friday."
"14092130","14093970"," But that's nice PX price not a."
"14100830","14101950"," Not a spy price."
"14124160","14125580"," Now one forty four. "
"14125960","14129180"," We got a new low here into the fifteen minutes."
"14129180","14133680"," So there's no requirement that we get out here to trade back up to three ninety five or even three"
"14133680","14135960"," ninety five fifteen three eighty four fifty four."
"14135960","14139960"," I mean excuse me three ninety four fifty nine or three ninety five fifteen. "
"14142200","14144400"," But still another half hour bearishness."
"14144400","14147420"," So I work to expect this PT to get a tag."
"14150700","14155260"," Either now or by the half an hour for the hour or the half an hour two o'clock. "
"14161390","14162450"," Let's take a look at Tesla."
"14167900","14170120"," Tesla trying to pull its pants up right now."
"14172140","14175060"," So Tesla right now right where Tesla is. "
"14176880","14178740"," Tesla's right on without rejection points."
"14180260","14183420"," We're in a three trigger cluster on Tesla right here."
"14183420","14187300"," So we're either going to see a pretty giant squeeze in Tesla. "
"14188420","14191060"," Or our failure and rejection to lows."
"14192020","14193620"," To pay attention to Tesla right here."
"14194920","14197600"," We got a three trigger we got a daily candle. "
"14198100","14203040"," We have a daily trigger and a five minute trigger and a one minute trigger on Tesla."
"14205080","14208660"," If price can get above one eighty seven twenty four."
"14209640","14214020"," You would expect a face ripper to one ninety sixty four. "
"14215560","14220120"," Let's get a lot of work to do and to be honest to the downside is."
"14221880","14223980"," I guess it's looking pretty bullish here."
"14224600","14225980"," Just looking a little bit bullish here. "
"14230530","14231830"," Five minutes improving."
"14238490","14241010"," Believe it or not the early is improving on it."
"14241350","14241730"," It's improving. "
"14241730","14245730"," And the daily is improving on Tesla as well."
"14245890","14246870"," Be careful if you're a bear here."
"14252320","14253740"," If you're a Tesla bear be careful. "
"14255840","14258580"," It could be a nice of fat rip on Tesla coming up."
"14276090","14277650"," Yeah, Tesla's about to squeeze."
"14283610","14284790"," Squeeze pretty hard too. "
"14289780","14291880"," And we'll see if it squeezes or if it rolls here."

"16081690","16082210"," And."
"16083370","16089610"," It's kind of wild because you're like you think you know what it looks like until you actually see"
"16089610","16089830"," it. "
"16089830","16095950"," And then you're like, wow, this is generations of malnourishment and how the human body can just"
"16095950","16096390"," change."
"16098070","16099670"," To that malnourishment."
"16102760","16111360"," And one of the wildest parts of Korea, the Koreas is they, these people want reunification, which"
"16111360","16112360"," you'd expect, right?"
"16112480","16114740"," It would be like the US being split in half. "
"16116340","16118040"," For a period of time."
"16119320","16121680"," Let's say we have a we have a civil war, let's say, right?"
"16121900","16124680"," And they split the US in half for a couple generations."
"16125980","16128720"," And they let's pretend they had split the US in half. "
"16128920","16131220"," Let's say hostilities and even though we're still a war."
"16131940","16137100"," Like general hostilities and there comes a point where you're like, you know, 20, 30, 40, 50 years"
"16137100","16137540"," down the road."
"16137620","16139760"," We were like, yeah, it's enough 70 years down the road. "
"16139760","16140340"," We were like, yeah."
"16141440","16143200"," That's just reunify at any cost."
"16144000","16146080"," And so I always find it kind of humor. "
"16146320","16147620"," I do kind of find it humorous."
"16148500","16153280"," When you hear things like, and of course the US wants no reunification."
"16154460","16156700"," Because it gives us a foothold, right?"
"16157240","16160980"," In Southeast Asia, you have a foothold there, military as a foothold there. "
"16161780","16163100"," We've influenced over the government."
"16163660","16164800"," They do great job."
"16165260","16166500"," A sub-create is a great job manufacturing. "
"16166500","16169100"," As well."
"16169260","16170300"," So the great trade partner."
"16171100","16174100"," And they're a military partner for us as well. "
"16174660","16178480"," They have a war like history, warrior like history."
"16178760","16180080"," They've they fight good wars and stuff."
"16180740","16183340"," The ruthless fighters that if you've ever met a rock soldier. "
"16184280","16186520"," There are okay soldier, public career soldiers."
"16186540","16187440"," They're badasses."
"16189020","16190060"," Complete badasses. "
"16194140","16195540"," I'd be scared of them, right?"
"16198840","16204000"," But but even so, like if this was in the United States at some point, you're like, yeah, you know"
"16204000","16204140"," what?"
"16204340","16205660"," It's just reunify at any cost."
"16206180","16207620"," And then on top of that too."
"16208840","16215360"," You've got on top of that, you've got North Korea, like Saver rattles constantly. "
"16215900","16217780"," They're just like constantly saved rattling."
"16218340","16222800"," Like we're going to do this and we're going to do that and they'll like, they'll like light off at"
"16222800","16224600"," 105 or 155 or something."
"16227320","16229740"," And threaten war and all this kind of stuff. "
"16230020","16231120"," But the real truth is."
"16233080","16239140"," That if North Korea just ever opened their border, if North Korea ever just opened the border to"
"16239140","16242400"," South Korea, there would be nothing that the US could do."
"16243160","16246280"," And they would more than likely reunify at any and all cost. "
"16247180","16253240"," It'd be something where without a shot being fired, you would likely see a reunification between"
"16253240","16254140"," North and South Korea."
"16254800","16260880"," And they would they would work out their politics, whether in our favor or not, the US's favor or"
"16260880","16265300"," not, you'd likely see without a bullet being fired, that war would be over."
"16266220","16271940"," And that's how that's how wild it is in in Korea. "
"16273020","16277440"," That you could see North Korea actually win a war without by that would be the way that's the"
"16277440","16281660"," everyone harps on like North Korea, their nukes and North Korea, this and that."
"16281660","16286760"," The truth is, if North Korea ever wanted to win that war, they just opened their border and the war"
"16286760","16287300"," would be over."
"16289280","16292160"," And you'd likely see backlash to the United States. "
"16293800","16298020"," You know, the US would lose footing in that reunification now trading 39443."
"16304490","16312150"," So like all the what you're fed as a civilian, what you're fed as, you know, as an American, the"
"16312150","16315070"," real truth of it is that the most dangerous."
"16316550","16326610"," The most danger to US, the most danger to the US right now would be, believe it or not, just"

"16429640","16435900"," Like that's why I try to relate this like like let's say the US."
"16436919","16441200"," Let's say we had the Civil War and you know, two or three generations passed and they didn't let us"
"16441200","16442540"," allow us to reunify because. "
"16443080","16443900"," I don't know."
"16444099","16444500"," I don't know."
"16444560","16448900"," Let's say Mexico wanted a buffer state between Canada and Mexico. "

"16452980","16453540"," We'll work it out."
"16460550","16463050"," Yeah, China definitely doesn't want reunification either. "
"16465720","16467439"," Well, I don't know that China doesn't."
"16467779","16474480"," I think that I think if there was reunification, China would do as much as they could to reunify"
"16474480","16477880"," with North Korea being the center of power."
"16478259","16482279"," And you'd expect that to that reunification with North Korea. "
"16493930","16498150"," Well, that's the same thing with we thought that happened with the Berlin wall falling, right?"
"16503200","16506640"," There was there was some economic damage done to that reopening to."
"16519250","16521830"," It's one of the few societies left."
"16522830","16530890"," I don't know. "

"16540230","16541369"," Like I'm on the. "
"16548360","16554439"," I'm like an old school Democrat, but I realized the need for the needs to be world police."
"16554939","16555840"," I know you don't want to hear that."
"16556779","16557919"," Like freedom isn't free. "
"16558599","16562919"," Even though even if we're horrible, we are sometimes at freedom, the US is."
"16563939","16568080"," I've been around the world like you see some places and you're like, oh, it's all nice and"
"16568080","16569160"," everything is great."
"16569380","16574500"," But the truth is as an American, a lot of us have no idea what it means. "

"16594820","16598099"," You go on vacation places and you're like, this is a nice place. "
"16598419","16601640"," But then you go like two blocks down the road and you're like, oh, shit."
"16603360","16604860"," That's one part about that's good."
"16605020","16605820"," In my view, that's good. "
"16606160","16608160"," And that's what personally why I joined the military."
"16608840","16613340"," It was a, like I was turning 17 or 18."
"16613580","16619220"," I didn't want to join the military and I joined because I felt this greater need like this, like,"
"16619380","16623680"," um, like this ideal list. "
"16623860","16626119"," There's a lot of people in our government like that too, right?"
"16626560","16627700"," That are longtime servers."
"16627960","16630259"," You'll see people that are can claim multi generations."
"16630259","16635099"," Some of the conspiracy there is to be like, oh, yeah, that's the, that's the fifth estate. "
"16637880","16639880"," They're not politically ideological."
"16640340","16643480"," They're old old school Americans that."
"16646640","16648040"," Try to tie together. "
"16651050","16653070"," An altruistic idea of freedom."
"16654130","16656810"," Now we fail at that all the time, but."
"16665320","16669400"," You know, it's like we want to be a Norway or we want to be one of these. "
"16671099","16677419"," We want to, we want to try to be like a Scandinavian country."
"16677419","16678460"," We just fail at it."
"16698630","16698990"," Yeah. "
"16699169","16699230"," Yeah."
"16699410","16699550"," Yeah."
"16699630","16700050"," I went to soldier. "
"16706369","16707930"," I can't see what you're doing there."
"16722480","16724800"," Well, some of the, some of the comments."
"16728669","16729189"," Hell, yeah. "
"16729390","16729810"," I would do that."
"16730290","16730890"," Oh, you know what?"
"16731009","16733610"," I thought this was, um, I don't think I've ever seen this one."

"16740050","16742869"," You know, like your, uh, your family, your family serves and stuff like that."
"16743050","16743849"," They feel like they owe."
"16745550","16747830"," They owe, they owe, like, uh, you know, like. "
"16752250","16754830"," You know, like, you know, it kind of like maybe scratch my head."
"16754830","16759430"," I was looking at, I remember when Elon Musk was saying something about, um, there shouldn't be"
"16759430","16761169"," identity politics in the military."
"16761169","16762390"," And I was like, yeah, I agree with that. "
"16762509","16770830"," But do you realize that our military runs on, our military is basically functions on a minority"
"16770830","16771450"," service."
"16773410","16779430"," That's one of the few places our society has offered minorities to have a way out."
"16780290","16784150"," Uh, protections for them and then a serious career. "
"16785230","16790150"," This is going back, uh, generation after generation after generation where, where they might come"
"16790150","16794030"," from places where they're, um, abused by society."
"16795130","16800750"," Uh, military has a very long, strong history of, uh, rear, uh, echelon cadre."
"16801350","16807890"," Uh, being able to give a career education, a step up, a leg up in society, cultural leg up. "
"16809430","16810510"," And I was like, scratch my head."
"16810570","16815390"," I'm like, I don't think he realizes that the military is, um, one of the most forward thinking"
"16815390","16819850"," institutions, uh, and you like an open door."
"16824240","16830280"," Uh, people otherwise don't have any other, any other way out of a bad situation in life. "
"16831440","16835180"," I know that some of the veterans here know this, but civilians probably don't know that."
"16847220","16848520"," Yeah, Paul is sure is the shipment."
"16848840","16849100"," He's funny. "
"16853050","16858090"," There's a cadre of, you know, that's an entire cadre of African Americans in the military, going"
"16858090","16859890"," back generation after generation after generation."
"16860450","16862390"," They keep our military, Terry running."
"16862850","16865570"," If you didn't know that, Elon Musk. "
"16869970","16873210"," Literally, logistically, keep our military functioning."
"16894840","16896300"," I'm not talking tip of the spear."
"16897300","16898720"," Good old boys from down south. "
"16898920","16900120"," I know who those guys are too."
"16916330","16919150"," No, the tip of the spirit doing shit without logistics."
"16921530","16926990"," The tip of the spares be polished in the rods without the, without the ramps. "
"16933430","16945370"," That was"
"16945370","16946890"," the other thing that kind of freaked me out yesterday."
"16947050","16949930"," I was really sad and, um, not makes natural gas."
"16950410","16952910"," April, he just said like two dollars and three cents. "
"16954130","16955450"," That's shooting yesterday."
"16957990","16959970"," No, that's shooting yesterday in Tennessee."
"16961470","16966010"," And then the one thing that bothered me about that most was I saw our picture. "
"16966250","16967730"," Maybe some of you saw there was a picture."
"16968230","16970370"," It really deeply, deeply troubled me."
"16970430","16971790"," I saw the child that was in the bus. "
"16973390","16978430"," There's a photo that came out of a child in a national bus that was being driven away and."
"16979390","16984850"," No, I'm X, W, C, I crude main futures set about 73 dollars and 20 cents a fowl."
"16985050","16991370"," That's up 39 cents or 0.54%. And the nine makes these away for futures set like two dollars and"
"16991370","16992870"," 76 cents a gallon. "
"16993250","16995050"," You know, that look inside of it."
"16995170","16996710"," That look inside of a face here."
"16997250","16997850"," I'll just take heads. "
"16998030","16998690"," I'll be careful here."
"17001150","17004170"," We look at a mix that child's face, right?"
"17004470","17005250"," I've seen that before."
"17005450","17005930"," You've seen that. "
"17006050","17007430"," I've seen that in adults and children."
"17009150","17013350"," Well, we got Vicks here trying to make a run back at the hourly trigger here."
"17015170","17016290"," I've seen that. "
"17016450","17017570"," I've seen that in the military."
"17018930","17024070"," And I'll tell you what, yesterday, my yesterday, I'll be honest here."
"17024210","17025750"," So yesterday when they first reported. "
"17027930","17034270"," So yesterday when they first put that that that shooting, I went on to Reddit to."
"17038530","17043330"," To LGBTQ subreddits to see what their take on this was."
"17044050","17047830"," And they were quiet, nothing, no posts, no commenting or nothing. "
"17048630","17049650"," And then I eventually saw."
"17050950","17053070"," And this is after being on Twitter."
"17053730","17055590"," And of course, everyone's harping on. "
"17057330","17058930"," That the shooter was trans."
"17060130","17062470"," And then I went on Reddit later and someone had made a post."
"17063710","17066070"," Comparing was there's two issues here. "
"17066070","17072810"," One is they're doing identity or identity politics on a shooter."
"17073830","17076630"," And saying this person was trans and they're a mass shooter."
"17077830","17082550"," But then when you look at the actual data, mass shootings are not committed. "
"17083730","17085870"," By people that identify as trans."
"17087010","17089390"," That's usually committed by white guys like me."
"17091910","17096290"," And a very, a very high percentage of white guys like me. "
"17096870","17097750"," And that do that stuff."
"17101590","17106470"," And we're talking like point zero zero one percent or something crazy like that, you know."
"17107270","17112570"," So you're, so, but the grossest part of it is you've, we've got a school shooter. "
"17112870","17114810"," We got somebody that murdered children."
"17117350","17121830"," Regardless of their identity politics or what, even if they're angry because they were trans."
"17124830","17132010"," And I made a post a day or two before about on Twitter saying something about conspiracy theorists"
"17132010","17134290"," and from the left and the right. "
"17135110","17140610"," We used to have programs help mental health programs in this country to institutionalize."
"17141250","17147790"," So natural gas falls to spot 8% to end a 30 month low of two dollars and three cents"
"17147790","17151410"," on a week springtime demand and storage over supply."
"17152250","17157450"," Now people with with which we since to we since to know whether those programs weren't good. "
"17157450","17159790"," They were actually really bad, right?"
"17160110","17161510"," They weren't they weren't implemented well."
"17162270","17166730"," But we cut a lot of these people loose on the street with no safety net to get them off"
"17166730","17167110"," the street."
"17170530","17175130"," And the real tragedy here is we're we're saying look it's these trans people. "
"17175950","17179450"," Pointing fingers and the truth is I'm watching this kid in this picture yesterday."
"17180630","17184030"," And it's worse that it's really it's really horrible."
"17185210","17188630"," The focus should be on these these families that lost their children. "
"17188990","17195570"," These kids whose they'll be it'll be if you're a soldier out there watching this program right now"
"17195570","17196610"," those kids you know."
"17197190","17200390"," I will never forget that experience for the rest of their lives."
"17200630","17201270"," It's going to come back. "
"17201870","17203370"," A week later, right?"
"17203550","17204070"," Three days later."
"17204330","17205170"," It's going to be like a nightmare."
"17205350","17207990"," If any of you have been raped or any of you have been. "
"17208290","17211370"," If you're any of you I shouldn't say raped, but any of you have ever been in a situation."
"17212130","17214890"," The way that this have PTSD happens is when you're putting a situation."
"17215970","17217630"," Many of you have PTSD down there. "
"17217630","17219850"," It's normally something that's out of your control."
"17220410","17223690"," Your your free will is taken away from you and something really bad happens."
"17224950","17229370"," And you relieve the relive these things like a nightmare like full technicolor nightmare. "
"17229590","17233550"," And they that the time between reliving those events spreads out over time."
"17234030","17236790"," But you never quite ever get rid of those experiences."
"17236790","17238650"," They'll come back to haunt you in your sleep. "
"17239030","17242470"," They'll haunt you in your decisions that you make for the rest of your life."
"17243390","17245330"," And so when you see these tragedies happen."
"17247250","17248930"," Rather than focusing on. "
"17249850","17252490"," The fact that we have this going on in our country."
"17254930","17257950"," With people with major mental health issues major."
"17258390","17261190"," No one normal is going to commit these crimes. "
"17261370","17262290"," Give me a squeeze here, baby."
"17262770","17263510"," Get on up there."
"17264470","17266970"," And we're trying to try to slap labels. "
"17267190","17268810"," But the left is the same way."
"17268930","17270170"," The left's like it's the white guy."
"17270290","17274110"," It's the it's the MAGA guy that's committing this trying to kill trans people. "
"17274110","17278670"," And you got MAGA people trying to point that trans people will kill and MAGA people."
"17278850","17280270"," You got like both sides."
"17281330","17284230"," And it's all identity on both sides left and right left and right left and right. "
"17284770","17287570"," The real tragedy man left in this the wake of this."
"17288230","17290310"," All of it are these innocent people."
"17292190","17293430"," And it's gross. "
"17294470","17298210"," It's gross when it's gross when you like hey it's a MAGA person."
"17298470","17301210"," It's gross when it's like you're you're a trans or something."
"17301210","17306530"," And we're like a signing blame when in reality we've got a mental health problem. "
"17306670","17308290"," This country that's fucking wild."
"17309330","17310590"," Absolutely fucking wild."
"17315280","17316840"," You know un unaddressed. "
"17317180","17318040"," It's not my problem."
"17318220","17318460"," It's there."
"17318620","17324220"," I've got I've had I've had two people in my life that have known with major mental health issues. "
"17324920","17328540"," They weren't my family or anything but I've known to two people."
"17328740","17333420"," And as far as I know they're just allowed to run around and live their lives."
"17333420","17335080"," There's no intervention. "
"17336280","17341120"," And I bet you probably know people in your life that have mental health issues like major ones."
"17342640","17344720"," They're allowed to pretty much do whatever they want."
"17345100","17346080"," They do anything they want. "
"17346560","17348800"," They could walk down and do anything they want at any time."
"17349380","17353060"," And I've seen family members of these people say they're okay."
"17353340","17357580"," They're you know they're they seek help or they're on medication or somebody. "
"17357680","17358780"," You really don't know if they are not."
"17359100","17361840"," They still have access to whatever they want to have access to in life."
"17361840","17364300"," And sometimes they leave path of destruction. "
"17364840","17370540"," You know sometimes they're oftentimes given excuses to well they have mental health issue."
"17371180","17372960"," You know it's not my fault right."
"17373100","17375560"," There's no my brother's keeper in this in the United States. "
"17375580","17377000"," There's no governmental intervention."
"17378320","17380040"," And that's bothersome to me at least."
"17382440","17386560"," You know they don't want the help you know but yet they still have access. "
"17388700","17394760"," And we're forced to accept these that these people as normal functioning human or society members."
"17394900","17397640"," I saw pictures of that person yesterday dressed up."
"17398260","17401780"," And I got friends that don't have mental health issues they dressed up in that shit. "
"17402080","17405840"," I think she or he had camouflage pants on had labels on a gun."
"17406420","17410040"," Like that kind of shit that that that that society that we have right now with."
"17410620","17412220"," I'm sure she showed it to her friends. "
"17412820","17414040"," And there's guys like that too."
"17414040","17416360"," Like there's the right there's people like that."
"17417320","17419260"," You know spend two three grand in a rifle. "
"17421080","17425400"," You know and you're like you're like living you live in that fake fake ass."
"17425700","17428500"," Some of souls are bullshit with some fake ass camos."
"17429440","17434980"," Tell me you're telling me you're just protecting your freedom when you're right. "
"17435180","17436580"," I'm like man come on."
"17437040","17438880"," Like some of this is just fucking crazy."
"17442740","17444880"," I know hunters out there that aren't like that. "
"17445000","17447320"," I know sportsmen that aren't like that."
"17447800","17449280"," But there's a whole there's a whole."
"17450680","17454320"," Like I remember I was a kid like when I was a young kid there was. "
"17456280","17460000"," When I was a kid if your family knew that you had it meant to health issues you weren't allowed"
"17460000","17460500"," around a gun."
"17462840","17465180"," That was that was there was no discussion on that."
"17465980","17469180"," Now everybody now is like focused on everybody has a right to a gun. "
"17470520","17475640"," There was a lot of respect for usage of firearms and weapons."
"17476040","17477980"," It was never glorified when I was a kid."
"17479040","17483860"," You have the stuff to go hunt with but you weren't walking around acting like you're a fucking"
"17483860","17484200"," soldier. "
"17485660","17488980"," We glorified that aspect of gun ownership to me is new."
"17489160","17489860"," I've never seen it."
"17490340","17491220"," Not like that. "
"17491360","17492920"," It was always it was always like."
"17494560","17497040"," It wasn't like there wasn't a glamorous part to this."
"17497720","17500900"," And like the glamorization of guns bothers me deeply too. "
"17501980","17503000"," It goes into the wrong hands."
"17503180","17506560"," Maybe not your hands but other people's hands and it's accepted which is kind of crazy."
"17507720","17508900"," You got my pink M16. "
"17509240","17510400"," I'm like I don't know man."
"17511060","17516460"," 394 9 M16 since it called an M16 394 41 right now."
"17516460","17518720"," 78 dollars and 65 cents a barrel. "
"17519180","17522140"," That's up 53 cents or 0 spot 68 percent."
"17528120","17529920"," This dream is sponsored by the tech."
"17530640","17531800"," Yeah, I don't know. "
"17531960","17536180"," I guess it doesn't bother any of us until it affects us right."
"17543230","17547990"," You saw that you'd build shooting right and you saw police outside by the truckload right."
"17548210","17549130"," None of those guys went in there. "
"17553580","17555640"," Some of those guys went and got their own kids out."
"17556340","17557320"," They did a good job."
"17557520","17565370"," Nashville PD did a good job yesterday but it's like not my yard, not my backyard, not my house has"
"17565370","17566390"," an effect of my family. "
"17566550","17569430"," But once it does then the rage kicks in right."
"17569690","17569890"," Finally."
"17576500","17577360"," Yeah, it's like a fetish. "
"17583990","17584970"," I'm not down with the gun fetish."
"17585850","17586550"," Never have them."
"17586690","17587090"," Don't like it. "
"17593460","17595300"," I'm not anti you own in a gun or anything out."
"17595420","17599000"," I'm not anti gun but I am anti like the fetish shit associated with it."
"17605120","17606720"," I think that's a good way to describe it. "
"17618270","17619950"," Yeah, I think I think we can all like that."
"17620070","17622290"," I think that most people I think if you're like a normal person."
"17623110","17624350"," You can identify it. "
"17624450","17624970"," I would bet."
"17625670","17626810"," I would bet any of you."
"17626950","17630610"," I bet no matter what your politics are out there, I bet you know somebody that you're like that"
"17630610","17632350"," motherfucker doesn't that shouldn't have a gun. "
"17633550","17634690"," I bet you know somebody."
"17636010","17637790"," I bet you know someone in life."
"17639030","17643150"," I bet you they're probably not they're not every time but they fetishize it. "
"17643150","17644470"," Like I bet you know somebody."
"17644590","17646570"," It's like that person should definitely should know a gun."
"17647110","17648550"," There's nothing I can do about it. "
"17650170","17652530"," I bet you know what or have known one person."
"17653790","17655330"," Now trading three ninety four fifty."
"17656090","17658510"," Trying to squeeze up and tag this three ninety four fifty eight. "
"17660450","17661650"," I bet you know somebody."
"17662470","17665490"," I bet you know somebody out there that you're like if you don't know that person."
"17665510","17668850"," I bet you know somebody you're like that person should never get their hands on a gun. "
"17668850","17672170"," And there's no way to stop them if they ever wanted one to get one."
"17680420","17684120"," I bet you know people out there that should be allowed to have a gun that can't have a gun"
"17684120","17685440"," for whatever shit they pulled."
"17686240","17687760"," I'm not into them getting a gun. "
"17688080","17689580"," You but we know the difference."
"17689760","17692400"," I think most rational people are like yeah."
"17693280","17696420"," That guy or like that guy got I don't know. "
"17696420","17701260"," Maybe you got a DWI or something and paid his penance or get a got a felony that was white"
"17701260","17701580"," collar."
"17702660","17704080"," Yeah that guy could probably have a gun."
"17704860","17708920"," But I bet you know somebody out there that's like that mother fuckers never been ahead of felony in"
"17708920","17709160"," a life. "
"17709600","17711880"," But they don't deserve they shouldn't have a gun on them at all."
"17719170","17721270"," I know it used to not protect them."
"17721430","17722890"," That's the thing that's where you're mistaken. "
"17724670","17725890"," It wasn't like that."
"17725890","17729930"," There used to be a time in this country up until the 1970s."
"17730070","17731350"," It would lock your ass up. "
"17733530","17738910"," Your sister your brother your neighbor would call and you would get locked up with no jail."
"17740950","17741750"," That's the truth."
"17742990","17744310"," He's to call up the nut house. "
"17747510","17748790"," That's the actual truth."
"17750610","17751730"," The good old days."
"17753810","17755290"," Remember those the good old days?"
"17755910","17756350"," No. "
"17756870","17758690"," We like to forget some of the good old days."
"17760490","17763670"," We like to remember just the good parts that we remember but not all of them."
"17765490","17766710"," We'd lock your ass up. "
"17768890","17769690"," No court."
"17775990","17777570"," You guys remember the death in that house?"
"17778410","17779770"," One fucking phone call gone."
"17781910","17783390"," You pulled some whack shit. "
"17783570","17784270"," You're out of there."
"17785710","17788870"," Now trade 39450 60 70."
"17795000","17796060"," That is the truth. "
"17801160","17805120"," It'd be kind of good like it'd be kind of good just like the like in the military."
"17805320","17806900"," They don't let you carry around loaded weapons."
"17807860","17810680"," Most military bases are not allowed to just walk around with a gun. "
"17810680","17813260"," Even the military doesn't trust soldiers do that shit."
"17815280","17819450"," You know just some kind of a background check would be nice."
"17820090","17821910"," Check with a doctor would be nice. "
"17822150","17822930"," Oh yeah baby."
"17824950","17827690"," Dude they're not paying shit on my calls right now."
"17829570","17831570"," All right that's the last pack right there. "
"17831670","17832270"," I'm done I'm out."
"17836290","17838310"," That's it for me I'm flat right now done."
"17841770","17847640"," It's weird like maybe you want to own a gun or something like that. "
"17847760","17851840"," I just think just a quick like doctor's note."
"17852740","17853640"," That would be nice."
"17854660","17855860"," Like a doctor's note. "
"17856200","17857960"," We can't do that with HIPAA right now right?"
"17858820","17859700"," This is doctor's note."
"17860620","17865740"," Does this person do you know anything about this person having major mental health issues?"
"17871360","17871920"," You know."
"17876550","17878550"," Yeah I'm not I want to bring back the good old days. "
"17879590","17888130"," It's just like to see like you know a father or a mother could say hey look my child has"
"17889510","17891170"," you know bipolar disorder."
"17892430","17894390"," They're functional but they shouldn't own a gun."
"17895430","17898470"," Here's their doctor don't allow them to own a gun. "
"17907200","17908400"," Yeah I don't know man."
"17908400","17912480"," You hear that I hear that shit all the time about good guys with guns stop shootings."
"17913040","17916400"," I'll tell you what man you own a gut you have a gun on you and the cops come you're"
"17916400","17917020"," going to get blasted. "
"17917580","17922940"," I think people have these pipe dreams of what owning or firing a gun at people is or what they're"
"17922940","17925420"," what it's going to be like firing a gun or a handgun."
"17927180","17932860"," I'd say 70% of gun owners couldn't fucking hit a human 10 feet away."
"17933860","17936600"," I could probably rip a gun off a shooter's hand. "
"17937260","17940960"," A civilian shooter rip it off his body before he even pulls it on me."
"17941840","17945300"," Civilians have this like a fever dream of what it's like being."
"17946200","17948700"," They have these like they have these like. "
"17951820","17957320"," If these like like like dreams or something I'm going to stop this and I'm going to stop that."
"17958220","17960120"," It's just not the case most times."
"17969760","17972260"," Let's see if we can pull back and grab another rip here. "
"17977220","17979980"," Right here it's setting up we'll see if we can grab one more."
"17989540","17994200"," Yeah I like to look at like gun trade any guys are ex-military know if you're any of your"
"17994200","17994940"," ex-soldiers."
"17996040","17998980"," You know you eat slip and sleep and shit with your weapon. "
"17999380","18000800"," It's all day 24 hours a day."
"18002260","18006640"," 24 hours a day break down clean it put it back together break down clean it put it back together."
"18008440","18014260"," Trigger discipline when you say every day I mean every fucking day I mean like day in day out day"
"18014260","18017200"," in day out 24 hours a day 24 hours a day. "
"18017720","18019580"," Some civilians trying to tell you."
"18022700","18028440"," They got this you'd have to be practicing with your shit day in day out day in day out."
"18028440","18030340"," It's like this really weird thing man. "
"18035440","18039560"," Break your weapon down blind put a scarf on somebody."
"18040480","18041660"," That's a big difference."
"18042700","18044960"," You got local police that don't even do that shit. "
"18046200","18049940"," You know local police that go and they qualify once a year or once every six months."
"18053270","18055370"," And you're expecting someone to be competent with a weapon."
"18057570","18061350"," Be more afraid of you as a civilian shooting me while you're trying to kill a shooter. "
"18062250","18065690"," I would be trying to run from you."
"18067050","18070330"," Be shooting guns trying to put bullets through walls and shit."
"18071050","18077370"," Watching movies thinking that a bullet doesn't go through a wall. "
"18078090","18078890"," Muzzle discipline."
"18081250","18084270"," We're not even talking about police showing up and seeing you held in a gun."
"18086430","18089830"," Shooting your kids through a wall or something crazy like seriously. "
"18090730","18092310"," The whole thing is insane."

"18846000","18849260"," The meetings that are coming out this week, the callers that are coming out in the market."
"18849920","18857480"," So my main focus here is into Friday, consuming and digesting, positioning for the next quarter. "

"18883290","18889510"," We got pending home sales at 10 and we got bar testifying at 10 a.m. I forgot the Senate's"
"18889510","18890990"," got the second hearing tomorrow too. "
"18892310","18894970"," So we got bar, we've got more of this bullshit tomorrow."
"18894970","18900230"," Just another, just another way to reset a short into tomorrow on the Senate hearings."
"18901090","18906290"," Another way to reset a short and then we've got Jerome Powell speaking tomorrow as well at a"
"18906290","18906690"," luncheon. "
"18909510","18914870"," You know, Bull's going to be hoping for Jerome Powell to come in tomorrow and try to take some of"
"18914870","18920250"," the, take some of the squeeze, or not the squeeze, but the full levered short on this market off."
"18921170","18924430"," So that's bound to add volatility to tomorrow's trade as well."
"18924430","18928250"," And then on Thursday, we've got claims continuing initial claims. "
"18928930","18933810"," We've got a bunch of speakers later in the afternoon and then the big one for this week is on"
"18933810","18934090"," Friday."

"18937670","18939070"," We've got J Powell again tomorrow. "
"18939790","18945310"," And then we've got initial claims and continuing claims on Thursday."
"18945890","18952690"," And then on Friday, we've got PCE that was, we were given a pass to PCE up until recently where"
"18952690","18957210"," they're trying to point fingers and say, yeah, maybe it's not the cost that's passed along to"
"18957210","18957490"," consumers."
"18958370","18965630"," Maybe it's where the production is, where the production of goods and services is actually where"
"18965630","18969310"," the gouging is coming and the inflation is coming and it's being passed along to the consumer. "
"18970810","18972430"," Like finger pointing on PCE."
"18972570","18974190"," So that's probably the biggest news we got coming in."
"18974430","18975630"," That's 8.30 on Friday. "
"19010910","19012010"," Yeah, Bull should FRC."
"19014130","19016050"," All that was is a gap close, in my opinion."
"19017690","19021410"," FRC had a gap close for that nice big squeeze we traded the other day at like four in the"
"19021410","19021910"," fucking morning. "
"19023990","19025750"," It's just a gap close, that's all that is."
"19025930","19028030"," My view, I think it's a very viable dip for FRC."
"19030390","19031770"," I'm bullish in FRC here. "
"19044600","19045540"," 395 C's, baby."
"19045980","19048560"," Send it up to 396, they're not going to close, I don't think they are."
"19048560","19053820"," I don't think they're going to close 451,000 puts in the money right here. "
"19055000","19055480"," Maybe."
"19058260","19063500"," I'm gambling that it's not gambling with those don't close in the money."
"19064360","19065660"," Maybe it's possible. "
"19072380","19075460"," I've made that trade 10 times, nine times out of 10."
"19075860","19077300"," They're not fucking closing in the money."
"19081400","19082440"," So I'll take the L."
"19083720","19085340"," I'll take the L in the one time. "
"19101490","19103650"," John Saperita saying, I can't get mowers."
"19103950","19106070"," I just ordered two customers took two years."
"19106910","19108910"," They called me, told me they had just half of my order. "

"19117930","19119390"," P-Y-X-S."
"19120410","19121430"," Let's look at it. "
"19132730","19133890"," A pump and dump."
"19134310","19136010"," I'm not going to talk about I refuse to."
"19136110","19138170"," It's probably, I don't want to talk about it at all. "
"19138890","19143750"," No, I will not give an opinion on P-Y-X-S."
"19144270","19144850"," I refuse to."
"19145530","19146110"," It's a pump and dump. "
"19146270","19147270"," I want nothing to do with pump and dumps."
"19147990","19154870"," My assumption is that it has a market cap of small enough that I could influence the price of it."
"19155150","19155350"," No. "
"19156430","19157030"," Apologize, brother."
"19171260","19172400"," It's not you, Fama."
"19172400","19174900"," It's that, do you know how this work?"
"19175020","19176080"," You might not know how this works. "
"19177300","19181400"," So how this works is, I'll go in and I'll buy that ticker."
"19182600","19184380"," I'll go in there and buy with size."
"19185560","19189300"," And then I'll start telling people about it that it should be bought. "
"19189420","19190560"," I'll make some videos about it."
"19192380","19198740"," Maybe I'll take a nice fat like six month out calls, maybe like 10,000 calls for like a penny"
"19198740","19199220"," or something."
"19200480","19206360"," Make sure that like a will, meat or somebody catches it on Twitter and they'll make a note of it. "
"19206440","19208500"," Someone, I'll pay somebody maybe to make a note of it."
"19209220","19213040"," And then you come in to buy all that shit and I'm selling my calls into you."
"19213960","19216520"," I'm making three, four, five pennies, ten pennies on it. "
"19216940","19218840"," You're bag holding, nothing happens down the road."
"19219580","19220220"," I'll tell you go to prison."
"19221200","19222060"," I don't want to do it, man. "
"19222880","19223880"," Whoever is doing it."

"19233360","19234200"," That's not you, man. "
"19234380","19236100"," It's whoever is doing that in the background."
"19236700","19237660"," I want nothing to do with it."
"19245670","19247210"," And it's not that you can't make money. "
"19247630","19248890"," It's that some people get fucked."
"19249710","19251030"," You could make money, Fama."
"19251730","19254470"," But then there's somebody getting fucked at some point on that trade. "
"19254950","19259170"," And I want nothing to do with fucking people over for manipulating shit."
"19259430","19260570"," That's why I trade the spy with you guys."
"19261150","19264110"," Mostly trade the spy with you guys because I can't manipulate it. "
"19264930","19267330"," There's nothing that I'm going to do that's going to influence the price of spy."
"19275790","19278630"," That's why we make the joke that it's the spy pumping dump room."
"19280710","19283490"," It's not like we're influencing the spy. "
"19283710","19284490"," There's just too much money."
"19285730","19286650"," These are all banks."

"19369710","19374650"," I mean, I've traded that shit in the past, but like with you guys on a stream."
"19375510","19379290"," This shit's re-streamed in blogs and shit, it's re-streamed in a bunch of discords."
"19379290","19383790"," It's re-streamed in a service in Europe, but you just don't want anything to do with that. "
"19383910","19384530"," So I can't."
"19385450","19387570"," The only person doing that prison time is me."
"19390610","19392510"," And then like, hey, look at that guy. "
"19392570","19393250"," He just got busted."

"19817320","19818300"," It's not a lot of work."
"19819240","19821700"," You have to be able to get with somebody and say, can you do this?"
"19821840","19822540"," Can you do that?"

"19843060","19843720"," I wish I had..."
"19843720","19844960"," I was thinking about today."
"19845380","19849000"," So when we came in to stream this morning, I was like, maybe I'll turn the stream on and do"
"19849000","19853960"," the work and then just not be here talking to you guys and just put the stream up."
"19854020","19855160"," You guys could do the chat together. "

"19861440","19862160"," I was like..."
"19862780","19866660"," And then I started working on it last night, and then I actually passed out working on it in the"

"20077940","20078660"," It's crazy. "
"20079780","20081940"," I can't even discuss some of this stuff."
"20087080","20093380"," I'll go back into my closet and then tomorrow I'll whip myself and say, stop talking politics and"
"20093380","20093620"," stream."
"20109020","20113340"," Hopefully they'll go and bitch to somebody out there and the people come to the stream just because"
"20113340","20113720"," of it. "
"20114240","20116460"," What do they call that on Twitter when you do that shit?"
"20117780","20120860"," It's a follower thirst."
"20122260","20123560"," You guys know what that means?"
"20124380","20126380"," You guys know what like follower thirst is?"
"20127320","20131300"," It's when you say something controversial and I piss you off."
"20133000","20138460"," So you go out into someone with some other social media space and you're like, fuck that guy. "
"20138920","20147380"," And what you don't realize is that five people saw red or heard you say that, so they come to"
"20147380","20147780"," the stream."
"20148600","20149400"," Do you know that?"
"20150740","20152780"," People do that shit on Twitter all the time."
"20155080","20156900"," It's follower farming, I guess. "
"20160640","20161740"," You guys know what that is?"
"20167830","20173070"," You stir the shit pot and you think you're like, you're like, fuck that guy."
"20173290","20173950"," So you make a pace."
"20174230","20174930"," You're like raged. "
"20175490","20176950"," You're like rage posting."
"20177770","20178730"," Tell all your buddies."
"20180150","20185170"," You don't realize, you don't realize that you've just actually helped that person out rather than"
"20185170","20185910"," just ignoring them. "
"20196180","20202020"," Yeah, you know what I mean?"
"20202020","20203860"," You know who does a good job of talking about this?"
"20204140","20206320"," Or you know who does a good job at it?"
"20208200","20210200"," Quinn does a really good job at it."
"20211680","20217800"," Quinn will build accounts that are like 70,000 followers in like a month or two, 100,000 followers"
"20217800","20218400"," in like a month."
"20219320","20221860"," And what the crazy part about Quinn is, he's a good one. "
"20221960","20223020"," He does a really good job at it."
"20225600","20229460"," So what he'll do is he'll post the opposite of what is actually happening."
"20229940","20234580"," So if we're like, if we're like mooning right now, he just posts that the market's going to burn. "
"20235120","20241380"," If we're going to the depths of hell, you say the market's going to turn around and go up, or"
"20241380","20242920"," especially like the Bitcoin crowd."
"20243860","20249620"," Anyone in the, any of the like, says the Britain has not seen bank deposit outflows amid recent"
"20249620","20250360"," banking turmoil."
"20250980","20253440"," This is the UK banking system is very resilient. "
"20254120","20256720"," And he has confidence in London's bank regulators."
"20257320","20262720"," This is the best thing government can do to keep the UK, UK housing market stable is to bring"

"20263780","20265440"," I'm ready to pressure on interest rates. "
"20265920","20270460"," And says he has no immediate concerns about the UBS credit, sweet, still execution."
"20271120","20274100"," And we will work closely with regulators to monitor it."
"20275960","20279780"," So like if you're a fervent believer in something like you just name them, right?"
"20280980","20287400"," Like Tesla, GME, AMC, if you're a Bitcoin crypto bro, right?"
"20287400","20292320"," Whether you're for or against any of these things, if you just come out on the opposite side of it,"
"20292320","20298160"," you daily points for Benachi and market profile levels by signing up at to the tick.com."
"20299460","20301040"," What's the other one that people do?"
"20301240","20306140"," They do the, um, I saw our STT shorts, short sell or STT made a comment. "
"20306620","20312660"," He was saying that you could do, um, that people will sell, that's how they follow."
"20313360","20317820"," So like they'll follow as many people as they possibly can and then interact with them."
"20318500","20320700"," And then they'll unfollow them once they're followed. "
"20321560","20326120"," That's another bullshit thing that people do on, um, on social media."
"20329050","20333710"," So you like to go into like your notifications, people to follow, you follow people that don't"
"20333710","20335030"," follow you with low followers."
"20335570","20337490"," And then you follow them and then you unfollow them. "
"20337630","20340230"," You interact with them and you unfollow them, which kind of ruthless too."
"20349900","20351040"," Yeah, best off."
"20351160","20352240"," You don't know how to find them. "
"20354480","20359480"," Yeah, I quite don't do really a, I quite don't say something to make you have an emotional response"
"20359480","20360740"," and you'll rage."
"20361920","20367060"," You'll rage, you'll tell all your friends and all your friends will come and start following them."
"20367240","20370720"," And then he'll like get like a hundred thousand followers then burn the account to the ground and"
"20370720","20371460"," do it all over again. "
"20372260","20373760"," It's kind of hilarious to watch."
"20384960","20386840"," And people are believers too."
"20387020","20388280"," They're like people believe it. "
"20388960","20392640"," They're like, oh yeah, don't tell me that guy like that guy, that guy's this."
"20392740","20394240"," I'm like, no, that's that guy's not that."
"20394940","20397620"," Guys trying to guys trying to prove a point. "

"21485670","21486950"," Made one trade earlier today."
"21486950","21488210"," Made another trade down here."
"21488250","21489050"," Another trade over here. "
"21490170","21492210"," Now I got some Yolo's here into the bell."
"21493210","21499470"," I'm expecting, I'm expecting, I wanted to do a call spread down here, but didn't do that."
"21501350","21506110"," So I'm expecting like a, it's kind of a melt up. "
"21506110","21510930"," A Fox reporter on Twitter says that first Republic is no longer for sale."
"21511230","21512250"," Ah shit."
"21513870","21514390"," What?"
"21518170","21521730"," Oh dude, FRC is one of these things we just don't look at it. "
"21521910","21527770"," Oh man, look at FRC to the clothes."
"21528330","21529750"," Oh no, FRC."
"21531090","21535870"," Somebody just took a two by four and just took a two by four and FRC. "
"21542430","21546570"," Somebody just took a base, I don't know, this is a Twitter report so you can't really trust Twitter"
"21546570","21546950"," anymore."
"21547530","21550310"," Hey, into this bell, let me ask you guys some questions out there."
"21550910","21553650"," I got more controversial talk for you today. "
"21555630","21558710"," What do you guys think about, what do you guys think about?"
"21559570","21562650"," What do you guys think about Twitter, man?"
"21562650","21565490"," Like, I don't know what to think about Twitter right now."
"21567670","21573730"," Like, Twitter's saying they're gonna, I think this rolls, I think this ultimately rolls up into"
"21573730","21576510"," your pain for Twitter one way or another."
"21576730","21577950"," I think that's the ultimate goal. "
"21578390","21582550"," So I don't even think there'll be an option for you to not pay at some point."
"21583250","21587050"," Let me know in the chat what you think because I find it kind of hilarious."
"21590470","21595370"," I don't know, I think I want to know what you have fascinated by what you think about where"
"21595370","21596190"," Twitter's going. "
"21596410","21602670"," I think there's like this weirdly weird thing in the background like, you know, it's like, well,"
"21602810","21605570"," they're gonna ban TikTok, so we'll start charging for Twitter."
"21606330","21606990"," It's kind of bizarre."
"21608110","21611630"," There's so many ways to monetize Twitter that's not like this. "
"21612030","21613790"," It's so bizarre, I think it's so bizarre to me."
"21615270","21621430"," Like, there's so many ways from the monetized Twitter and you take like, kind of the stupidest way"
"21621430","21622470"," to monetize something."
"21622770","21623850"," It's got to be the stupidest way. "
"21625850","21630890"," Like, for all the options to monetize Twitter and that's the one you're choosing."
"21632570","21635510"," The writing is really on the wall right now."
"21635510","21644250"," And the other, I think the other thing, the thing that kind of scared me yesterday was the cot. "
"21644410","21645330"," Think about this tonight."
"21646930","21649190"," Twitter is like a useful thing, right?"
"21652590","21655770"," People that want to get news breaking news out use it, right?"
"21655990","21657230"," People from other countries use it."
"21657450","21662990"," All these reasons that are good, like why you need to have Twitter, even if you don't on it, why"
