"1740","3019"," Hey, what is going on?"
"5040","10180"," This leader is provided to permit the projectionist to complete adjustment of focus and sound level"
"10180","11860"," before the film begins."
"63610","68610"," Check one, two facts, but it is going to have a trimming of a quarter GDP."
"69910","76250"," So does that take any, does that bring a recession call back more into focus for you or maybe you"
"76250","77730"," want to market or. "
"78530","82050"," Still a pretty solid market we're looking at."
"83150","88170"," Well, look, I think what's happened here and this is typical is that the stock market has a reflex"
"88170","93650"," rally of significance and then everybody starts to fit the narrative into what the stock market's"
"93650","93930"," doing."
"94770","100730"," And so, you know, we saw this back in, you know, in 1989, we saw it again in 2007, we"
"100730","103250"," saw it, you know, in 2000. "
"103750","104070"," Good morning."
"104790","108890"," So reflex rally in a bear market, and everybody starts to say, well, it's a soft landing."
"109470","111210"," So everybody throws in the recession view. "
"111770","118170"," The recession view is really about the liked impact of the most regressive fat tightening cycles in"
"118170","118770"," 1981."
"119930","123790"," And I didn't think everybody had a rotation to pass to us."
"123970","128270"," It takes about a year for the recession to unfold after the first fat rate hike. "
"128490","130790"," So tell me, first rate hike marks 2020."
"130790","135870"," So I still think this recession is during us in the face and perhaps you can argue that fiscal"
"135870","139170"," policy gave this and that's the lifeline."
"139630","141530"," But there is nothing more powerful. "
"142050","143430"," Let me turn that off right now."
"144890","146570"," I mean, just one quick second."
"146790","148210"," I got some stuff I got to do in the background. "
"150250","151130"," Corn y'all."
"151210","151670"," How y'all doing?"
"155990","158070"," I feel like a great weekend."
"158890","162910"," It's like we had like 50s, 60s last week, and then this weekend. "
"164070","167110"," Just ripping face off 90, 90 plus degrees."
"172100","173580"," All that on there."
"178740","179860"," Members save. "
"179860","188990"," Okay, we'll see what this thing does."
"189270","190510"," Like YouTube's asking a bunch of questions."
"190810","191490"," I'm not used to. "
"198200","199080"," Right there."
"200240","201040"," Close that."
"201720","203340"," Squeezing off the bell this morning. "
"203540","208860"," There was a just a heads up for you that there was a recheck on hourly half our trigger right"
"208860","209800"," down here before the open."
"210820","212180"," We are trading above."
"212560","219840"," We should pull back after this tag right here and tag 437.83. And then begin to make our way"
"219840","220460"," higher here. "
"221280","225100"," Take out this previous high at 438.76 from pre market."
"227400","232240"," And we also have an ultimate target above that same target from Friday."
"232240","232920"," We talked about. "
"232920","239540"," It's right around 445.08. I want to see if we can catch a trend day today."
"240180","242600"," We have some stuff to talk about today about this trend."
"243300","245240"," We have a whole bunch of stuff to go over. "
"246060","247780"," Is the correction over?"
"248960","251180"," And how much time do bulls have left?"
"251460","252640"," Is the second big question?"
"253760","258779"," Of course we've got the old guys getting together up in the mountains."
"259420","265140"," They've got all the hookers leaving stir just to show up to service all the old creepy old white"
"265140","265560"," guys."
"266240","268640"," We'll buy one of those guys this morning as well. "
"269720","272140"," Let me just do a couple things here."
"274480","275780"," Hang tight here."
"286040","287080"," SPX. "
"287600","288040"," Yes."
"291160","293940"," Use or look at Tesla today."
"309590","310630"," Good morning. "
"310750","311450"," How's everybody doing?"
"314630","317570"," Yeah, we're going to talk about TLT as well today."
"318090","324190"," We have to talk about TLT because I think it closed its gap in pre market."
"324190","327190"," And there was one more. "
"328030","331990"," There was one more gap, but it was filled like a couple of days prior."
"332970","335110"," So we have to take a look at the TLT today."
"335110","337330"," It's a big one to talk about now. "
"338810","340770"," Someone's asking in the stream about TLT."
"341130","342210"," There's a greater."
"344430","348390"," There's a greater discussion that we have to have about. "
"349150","353710"," So I guess talking about, hey, is the correction over or not, right?"
"353870","354470"," Is a big question."
"354930","355270"," Is it over?"
"355530","356210"," Is it not over?"
"359130","360870"," Let me see if I can bring this chart up."
"362230","363450"," Just take a peek here. "
"367550","372090"," Now with that question, is the correction over or not?"
"372910","376830"," There's a greater question, which is time."
"378210","379970"," We have seasonal weakness."
"381250","383330"," In the fall at some point, we have. "
"383870","388410"," Usually, I know it's like seasonal is like a term you can throw around that."
"388790","390230"," Can be manipulated."
"392490","397190"," For against dragon, but generally speaking, we get a week period in the fall. "
"397650","399490"," We get a week period in late winter."
"399810","404830"," We also usually get a bottom for risk on markets coming into spring, right?"
"406290","409750"," So you know, there's going to be some kind of a pullback in those timeframes."
"410270","412330"," The question becomes time for bulls. "
"412730","413830"," Do they have the time?"
"414870","418050"," We're in August 21st."
"418290","424050"," Do bulls have the time to make the run that they want to make to that board?"
"424050","428070"," Or four six, excuse me, four, six, six, five, like four 70."
"429610","431210"," For the caller for the quarter. "
"434030","435730"," Do they have the time to do that, right?"
"435890","440290"," That would be the question is, if they have the time to do that, if risk will stay on in"
"440290","440670"," the market."
"441910","443090"," For that to happen."
"444110","452070"," And if it doesn't referring to this question about TLT, do you see some flight in the bond market"
"452070","454830"," and also into, believe it or not, energy?"
"456610","458150"," Where does the risk go?"
"458750","462810"," You have to pay attention to where this money goes, right?"
"462930","468910"," Is it just a matter of taking up the profit running as a matter of shifting risk elsewhere?"
"469450","473790"," So that's like the question of the topic or the question that I'm looking at as well. "
"473790","477270"," Do people put, you got to see money fleet of bonds then to gas, right?"
"477450","485590"," Or oil, I should say, to CL and CL is coming into some major support of its own, a major,"
"485590","487790"," like, large timeframe support."
"488630","490630"," So there is question about that this morning."
"491470","494890"," I was watching TLT as well this morning, just a heads up to you out there. "
"495030","499150"," So I'm trying to see what this interplay is going to be with with oil."
"503680","504440"," Hey, what's up, Dave?"
"504600","505100"," Good to see you."
"506620","511299"," So we do, should we get a trend day today looking for, we'll start looking back here and see if"
"511299","512460"," we can get some targets for you. "
"513260","515280"," We've got the pre-market high that got tagged."
"516559","518320"," We've got another one up here at R2."
"518820","521179"," Let me see if I bring this over so you guys can see it. "
"528130","529630"," Looks like trend day, right?"
"529830","533370"," You've got this pre-market garbage right here."
"533370","534550"," It's got to get taken out."
"534550","538410"," We've got it looking for more upward push to this R2. "
"538890","540130"," Close this gap here."
"540170","541650"," We've got another one up in here."
"542650","546030"," We've got deli trigger sitting up here with a lot of all back here. "
"546050","547170"," I don't know if you can see it right now."
"548710","550630"," So you can see where that deli trigger is."
"550970","552550"," This is where the sellers are. "
"552670","554890"," They're sitting way up here at 445-14."
"556210","557650"," We'll get into all that today though."
"557730","560270"," We're going to look at, is the correction over?"
"560270","562150"," Do we still have the targets down below?"
"562870","565510"," And that's another question too as we never came down here. "
"566470","568610"," And actually tagged our weekly trigger, right?"
"569010","572850"," So we do have some question of during this week."
"574250","575710"," I'm going to bring this over here."
"576870","583370"," During this week heading into the big ski trip up north. "
"585310","587590"," The question becomes, can we get above this?"
"587850","589490"," Do we end up dragging down into this?"
"589670","593390"," Then tagging this into end of the week for the track?"
"593430","597650"," I'm trying to go with some funny names for it this morning because like John H."
"597830","603390"," And all that bunch of people have a bunch of terrible names for the back padding that's coming."
"604190","608890"," They're trying to say that it's going to be what I was listening to this morning was going to be"
"608890","609810"," a very hawkish weekend."
"610430","611570"," A very negative weekend. "
"611910","613970"," That's what we're looking forward to in a very negative weekend from the Fed."
"614250","616410"," I think that we pat in their backs is what I think they're going to be doing."
"617750","619250"," That's, that's what I think that they do. "
"619850","622350"," It seemed like Jerome took a victory lap."
"622970","624550"," His last rate decision."
"629030","633550"," They reminded me of the last victory lap that he took when he went like what COVID was solved or"
"633550","634610"," whatever from the Fed. "
"639890","640550"," So good morning."
"640690","641290"," Everybody's doing well."
"651390","659470"," Had some diversions from HYG into Friday's clothes, I believe a little bit of diversions. "
"659710","660870"," Friday was a nice close too."
"661610","666150"," So I cut out early Friday and I didn't see it until Saturday."
"666790","667910"," I was like Saturday. "
"668150","671610"," I was talking to Quinn and I'm like, Oh shit, like we should open up green on Monday."
"672210","674590"," You can see that nice five minute cross into the close."
"674930","679550"," Hopefully you guys saw the five minute close on Friday. "
"679550","683190"," It was extremely bullish and at least the open today."
"684110","685850"," HYG now reversing course."
"690870","692830"," Dixie with a small bit right now. "
"695170","699130"," Vic's just about to close out some gaps down below in a one minute."

"721920","722900"," Let me make sure we're on Twitch."
"724760","730920"," We had a had to do some private streams."
"734040","734520"," Sweet. "
"734820","735480"," So we are on here."
"737100","738020"," Last was us."

"742920","743480"," So we've got."
"746240","747860"," The expectation here."
"748060","750460"," Let's take a look at a look at one more thing here. "
"756260","757220"," 426 87."
"758160","759420"," It's even lower actually."
"761620","762700"," Way down here. "
"763980","773280"," I don't know if I can make it to show CL."
"773600","774320"," Give me a minute here."
"774400","775680"," We'll go over CL two for a moment. "
"775680","779880"," A million pounds in bonds in the auction receiving three billion pounds in bids."
"779960","783480"," The APF field sale operation coverage three to 79."
"784640","787100"," So we all know this is the weevil full chart now. "
"787260","789100"," This stream is sponsored by Ticksright."
"789480","791220"," Here's our price target down here."
"791780","795940"," The concern that I have here is multi bold. "
"796360","801720"," So they don't have a we've got some vol this week."
"801960","802380"," But of course."

"827900","830540"," Normally at these things you're going to get."
"831360","836940"," People say they're in the know and try to you know shit on the stock market throughout the week. "

"865900","868240"," They got Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. "
"869140","870680"," You've got this big looming."
"871260","874240"," These guys up here are where the real sellers are."
"874460","875500"," They're up here waiting to sell. "
"877100","881120"," We're going to find out if this if they marched down as time passes or if they hang out."
"881280","885320"," Continue to hang out to the upside here in case there's any kind of squeezing that's going on."
"885600","890140"," Just be aware of this if you're if you are a seller to know that there's some problems. "
"890160","891740"," sellers up here still."
"892780","900420"," There are still some are still as a we don't know yet but some pretty serious sellers up here we"
"900420","908020"," know that they're right here we need to overrun them to to begin to reverse to the upside so until"
"908020","915280"," we have that so if you're a bull out there right watch my cursor right here until price gets above"
"917060","927020"," so your sellers are right up here right until I'm gonna"
"927020","935160"," show you guys something unless you see price at any point the price pretty much the screen price"
"935160","941900"," needs to actually get above this 445 and the hourly trigger needs to come up and you need the one"
"941900","946240"," in the five up there and this would be a sign not even a sign but this would be trend"
"946240","954160"," reversal right this is where you can get bullish again it wouldn't even be the first squeeze it"
"954160","960640"," would only be after a successful retest of that hourly or that daily trigger so until we see that"
"960640","969860"," bulls are not out of the invariably bulls are not out of the forest trend is not up yet"
"969860","978740"," now there's nothing saying trend is up the one good thing bulls have here is prices above the"
"978740","986400"," hourly trigger right now so if this holds that's an improvement for bulls to improvement to go up"
"986400","993320"," as long as this gets a or we stay on this hour and don't get underneath it start heading up"
"993320","1000440"," here yeah you could say bulls are in charge to or looking for that high on the week of 445"
"1000440","1008300"," then of course you've got that major ball into end of week let's look forward to on Thursday and"
"1008300","1016240"," Friday and the tone right now that I'm hearing out there is hawkish hawkish hawkish hawkish I do"
"1016240","1023079"," like the price of the market where it is right now heading into Jackson Hole normally if we trade"
"1023079","1029560"," up into Jackson Hole to get big new highs that kind of stuff a little bit more wary heading into"
"1029560","1036520"," it so as we're down here if you if at any point you see weakness in the market and we're"
"1036520","1044079"," trading down here into this 428 426 and change this zone down here for me this would be a big"
"1044079","1051800"," a big buy for me there is another question to of the JPM caller being down at 420 and so"
"1051800","1058740"," that that can act as a magnet as well into the quarter so I'm hyper aware of that in the"
"1058740","1063740"," background I don't know if some of you are aren't or not but it's other concerning area down below"

"5303890","5313710"," kind of gross and come on it's kind of gross you need like money power influence"
"5313710","5322810"," all this grossness and the other gross thing too I'm talking to a friend about this is it's weird"
"5322810","5328650"," like admissions counselors are like they're like two things through through things so like number"
"5328650","5337390"," one all these kids went through covid so all of their applications are and then covid hit and it's"
"5337390","5345470"," not that it's not real it's that everyone has the same story the second thing is that for kids to"
"5345470","5352730"," get into school they want they have to it's really fucked up it's like it's like what are what are"
"5352730","5358430"," what are admissions counselors looking for well they're looking for leaders and it's like they want"
"5358430","5364010"," to they want the future leaders and I'm like well not everyone's gonna be a leader and leaders"
"5364010","5371790"," typically don't make things actually happen if the engineers do and the computer scientists do and"
"5371790","5381470"," the like all these like technical backgrounds actually make this stuff happen so but they're like"
"5381470","5386110"," we want leaders we want somebody that's gonna change the world and so like we'll take them in our"
"5386110","5393610"," program they have to have perfect SATs rigor of course load a core or course load rigor and then"
"5393610","5398730"," they also need to be leaders so I think a big thing and you know not everybody can be a"
"5398730","5403690"," leader and not everybody can be or you don't want everybody to be leaders either right you don't"
"5403690","5410250"," want your best students to just be leaders you want something you want to be taken in people"
"5410250","5417570"," they're like great at technical things right engineering doctors anything like that right doctors"
"5417570","5423270"," of medicine not necessarily you don't want the administrators getting all the positions in the"
"5423270","5428050"," great schools you want the great doctors to get those positions in those great schools but that's"
"5428050","5434530"," not what our education system is built right now so it's kind of sad like I was going to do"
"5434530","5444390"," a a community garden for my my child and we put it on the back burner like yeah maybe not"
"5444390","5453070"," maybe it's too much responsibly too much work and we're back to that discussion again about doing a"
"5453070","5461370"," community garden why because it's just going to college and it's not good enough like it's just to"
"5461370","5467810"," create things and be a leader of something and have volunteers and be the founder or something like"
"5467810","5472930"," that's kind of bizarre to say all that but that's what they're looking for right and the schools"
"5472930","5480130"," she wants to get into there's no guarantee with her grades she's getting in the other fascinating"
"5480130","5486390"," thing is I was talking to a friend I shouldn't say a friend this is an acquaintance over the"
"5486390","5494130"," weekend and he had said that his son he was like my son did not get into the University of"
"5494130","5503010"," Michigan great grades great rigor great everything great SATs got a 35 on his ACT it's pretty good"
"5503010","5512350"," and not not perfect but pretty pretty good and did not get in got into an Ivy League school did"
"5512350","5522270"," not get into the University of Michigan from Michigan doesn't live in well on his"
"5522270","5530330"," application to get into the University of Michigan but yet got into an Ivy League school so that"
"5530330","5535510"," probably another question do they have to apply to like five or ten different schools at first I"
"5535510","5541270"," was like at first I was like yeah we'll just apply to a couple schools two three schools and then"
"5541270","5545650"," everyone I'm speaking to with kids going into college like no no no they have to apply to like ten"
"5545650","5553170"," at least like three to five Ivy leagues and three to five top 25 schools and like another five"
"5553170","5557790"," safety schools and I was like why wait they do they do this great they should be able to get"
"5557790","5563430"," into kind of like kind of the schools that they should get into and that has not been the case"
"5563430","5571870"," so no love here no joy for cap no joy failure to get above the one minute right here"
"5571870","5580790"," still not stopped out yet close to it though back to being close again to being stopped out here so"
"5580790","5588030"," it's kind of weird like the it's like a minefield for kids and it's really bizarre because like"
"5588030","5593270"," your kids have to it's not good enough to be it's"
"5593270","5603150"," not good to put high school soccer you have to be the captain right of your soccer team you're the"
"5603150","5610390"," captain of your field hockey team and even that's not good enough this other girl she was a winner"
"5610390","5616090"," of a math Olympiad didn't matter didn't get her anywhere so you know there's money power in the"
"5616090","5623850"," background already against you to get into a school and even if you do something great they have"
"5623850","5628950"," this like it's like we're turning into a country of like yeah we need a bunch of I like pompa"
"5628950","5636470"," like we pomps everywhere rather than people actually build things to get these prestigious"
"5636470","5643170"," schooling opportunities college of honors all that kind of stuff so in this like really weird place"
"5643170","5650590"," like yeah do you like and that here's another weird thing so we just did two big interviews for the"
"5650590","5657990"," oldest kid to go back to school and two of these schools that we interviewed at were like we give"
"5657990","5664090"," we only allowed them to take so many AP classes in their junior year they're like you we have a"
"5664090","5670410"," two max or we have a three max and then another school yep I am out so I just got"
"5670410","5678150"," stopped out of that trade just then so like they got a they've got a like this really weird thing"
"5678150","5687730"," where this other school is third school where we we actually homeschool these in-person teachers"
"5687730","5694930"," tutors everything but it's all homeschooled right a secular homeschooling this is the homeschool"
"5694930","5702490"," that we're in is for military families that travel around the world and so this other school that"
"5702490","5710590"," was like yes wants to take four AP classes that's fine she's already in my fact she's going into"
"5710590","5715710"," national honors society for the second time or whatever the high school one is she was in like the"
"5715710","5719590"," junior high one now she's going into the high school one I think she like lapsed or something I"
"5719590","5725670"," didn't pay and it's really bizarre so you have some stopped out here man like like that took that"
"5725670","5735530"," triggered me right there like that bar right there triggered me right out and so that now we're in"
"5735530","5743050"," this other conversation where we're looking at it's like well does that prestigious school actually"
"5743050","5750430"," give her what matters on a college application which is kind of weird there's like still"
"5750430","5760310"," not closed down if she applies to"
"5760310","5769190"," her University of Choice let's say and she doesn't have or she's exhausted everything a school"

"5777390","5787350"," classes online or does she take this procedure school and then add two classes that are college"
"5787350","5794010"," level so that she has her full course load but then we're like yes we'll be driving everywhere for"

"5799670","5805390"," she's gonna do it's like a variable minefield and then there's the other question which is yeah you"
"5805390","5812310"," don't have to do all this stuff you just donate five million dollars to whatever school they're"
"5812310","5816130"," going to and then people like that's not even enough feel like you gotta donate like 20 or 60"
"5816130","5821270"," million I'm like I don't have that kind of money there's no fucking way that's happening no way"

"19680740","19689120"," you've got work to do like bulls have some relative safety above 445 and real safety above 450"
"19689120","19695140"," bulls like I said it's the bears all the time right you have to do this you have to do"
"19695140","19699440"," that you have to do this you have to do that once you do that it's all yours you can"

"19704880","19708560"," bulls are not in control right they have to get above the daily trigger they have to get the hourly"
"19708560","19714260"," above the price above to go back into a regime of going up and buying dips do you see that"
"19714260","19720360"," now I want you to pay attention to this yellow line here there's a reason for it I want to"
"19720360","19728180"," bring you back to previous examples okay this is a current break that we just had so we're kind of"
"19728180","19734280"," like right here right prices down here we're bloodbath and doom and gloom bears all well crazy"
"19734280","19738580"," telling you we're getting a market crash all that kind of stuff what you're not seeing in here is"
"19738580","19744960"," this yellow line is not falling price yellow line not falling price yellow line not falling price"
"19744960","19751700"," yellow line not falling price yellow line not falling price again and again and only when you see"
"19752440","19762320"," the yellow line following price down to the weekly trigger is at the top that is the top so"
"19762320","19767440"," are we at a top right now I'm going to tell you, fuck you, no, we're not at a top. "
"19769100","19771120"," Suck my balls, you'd think we're at a top."
"19773200","19774800"," No way, no how."
"19776100","19781840"," What I want to see up here now, even though we're not at a top, what are bulls expecting here?"
"19782260","19783860"," That's a whole nother conversation, right?"
"19784560","19786400"," What are bulls expecting out of this?"
"19787200","19792220"," Are they just expecting to get up here and trade this $4.45 and then continuation of the downside?"
"19792220","19797680"," Does the yellow not follow, and then it comes back up, you get your double bottom down here, and"
"19797680","19799920"," eventually in October you go and hire. "
"19800560","19806960"," And even then, you're like, this break here, this break here in this daily trigger tells you, and"
"19806960","19809480"," maybe you're not getting 4.72 by end of quarter."
"19809940","19812600"," Maybe you're not getting 480 by December, right?"
"19812900","19815480"," See, maybe you lower the expectations here for a bull."
"19816340","19817040"," Can all that change?"
"19817800","19818140"," Fuck yeah. "
"19818720","19823640"," If you start to see a V-shaped recovery, we break above here before the end of the month."
"19823660","19825640"," We start breaking up here in the end of quarter."
"19826060","19826820"," Yeah, I'm all with you. "
"19827240","19828900"," Take that trade right along with you."
"19830000","19830480"," Okay."
"19832100","19835360"," So for right now, was this the top?"
"19836740","19838440"," Very low chance that's the top. "
"19839280","19840980"," 15% chance that's the top."
"19842260","19846420"," Will we likely come back up here and trade this before end of year?"
"19846660","19847660"," At least fail this."
"19847660","19851600"," At least fail 4.57. Absolutely. "
"19854840","19857200"," We're going to trade 4.57.50 again."
"19857640","19860640"," Like a 70 to 80% chance we're trading that."
"19861180","19863040"," Maybe not this week, maybe not next week. "
"19864140","19868560"," Oh, trading 26 cents right now and calls for tomorrow."
"19870000","19872940"," Trading 34 cents for calls for Wednesday."
"19873860","19875720"," So are we in doom and gloom?"
"19876080","19877460"," Is this a correction?"
"19878040","19878580"," Is it the top?"
"19878820","19879620"," No, it's not the top. "
"19880240","19881400"," I'll tell you right now, it's not the top."
"19881800","19882240"," Guaranteed."
"19883100","19884660"," Like not getting like 70% chance. "
"19885040","19885700"," 80% chance."
"19886380","19888420"," We have not seen the top in the market yet."
"19889220","19891120"," Where is the top in the market?"
"19891620","19895220"," There is a high probability that it's somewhere right in here. "
"19895300","19903020"," Some kind of failure at 4.55.87. Can we go higher than this and trade those other numbers that"
"19903020","19905620"," we have higher than 4.65, 4.70, 4.80?"
"19905800","19906440"," Yeah, we can."
"19907080","19910260"," If we start squeezing and ripping faces off, fuck yeah, we can get there."
"19910400","19913360"," But is it like guaranteed right now?"
"19913560","19915120"," Or hey, bulls are in charges right now?"
"19915420","19916980"," Fuck no, no it is not. "
"19918880","19920520"," No, no way is it."
"19922720","19926120"," Trading 24 cents right now and calls for tomorrow for 443."
"19927020","19929180"," Trading 32 cents. "
"19929360","19931700"," I should have taken that and I didn't take that."
"19931700","19936700"," So switching back over to a Webull full chart screen."
"19938120","19940680"," Minimum expectations for bulls this week. "
"19942360","19945000"," Minimum expectations either Tuesday or Wednesday."
"19945260","19946980"," I'm going to draw this out for you."
"19947600","19948900"," What the expectation is. "
"19948920","19953780"," Now we're going to talk about this too because last Monday we sold after the belt."
"19954120","19956140"," So right here, right?"
"19956360","19957440"," What do I want to see tomorrow?"
"19957680","19958400"," I want to see this 440."
"19959080","19960960"," Today or tomorrow I want to see this. "
"19962560","19963980"," I don't mind to pull back."
"19965200","19965980"," On Tuesday."
"19967000","19968980"," But I do want to see this by Wednesday. "
"19969200","19970300"," It's 443, 445."
"19971000","19971660"," Okay, somewhere in it."
"19972200","19972940"," That's my expectations. "
"19973440","19974400"," That's what I want to see."
"19975400","19976280"," Saying that."
"19977040","19977960"," Saying that, right?"
"19978180","19980800"," This all means that we have to hold the hourly trigger. "
"19981480","19982240"," Like you have to hold it."
"19983320","19985140"," Can't like come into the close today."
"19986060","19987080"," Squeeze up in this close. "
"19987420","19991300"," Then begin to sell off, get underneath the hourly trigger and be bullish, right?"
"19991620","19993800"," You got to switch over and be bearish here."
"19994180","19995100"," If that happens."
"19996100","20000660"," If you are looking for, if you're like, I missed all this cap, I didn't take any of this. "
"20001300","20004100"," Earlier in this broadcast, people were like, go to the dark side."
"20005020","20006300"," Take the puts down here."
"20006400","20006940"," I didn't do that. "
"20007240","20007940"," Pop the dip, right?"
"20009000","20012140"," So I'm sure that there's a pain trade going on right now."
"20012140","20015120"," I'm sure half the stream is pissed off right here where we are right now."
"20015840","20018540"," So if you're looking, if you're like, hey, cap, I missed all this. "
"20018680","20020280"," I just want to, I just want to buy and cap."
"20020640","20025160"," You are looking down here, right where this DCA Wednesday calls if pullback right here."
"20025180","20026140"," You want to buy buying this. "
"20026900","20029280"," So currently that sits at 437, 48."
"20030020","20032300"," If you have a chance to buy that, buy that dip."
"20033300","20036160"," The worst case scenario, you're buying this, right?"
"20037360","20039000"," Starts the bounce and you can take that higher. "
"20039260","20039800"," There's your entry."
"20039800","20041640"," It begins to roll lower."
"20041940","20046480"," You cut yourself out of that trade and you start to sell the market or buy puts. "
"20047160","20050420"," Now, can they get all doom and gloomy into this clothes like they did last Monday?"
"20050640","20052540"," You're fucking a where I take hand."
"20053240","20059400"," So if we get up into this price target into the clothes today, let's say we trade this 439, 93,"
"20060180","20065500"," 439, 93, and we take the money off the table here."
"20068180","20070540"," Trading 439, 49 right now. "
"20070780","20077280"," If we trade this right here, right, and you've been bullish and you've been riding this up, you'll"
"20077280","20082180"," like take the money right here and look for a dip buy down in here at some point after the"
"20082180","20086160"," bell or what have you or the open if they get nasty and sell this down."
"20086640","20093060"," So you're going to be sitting on the sidelines until we either hit this target right here or a dip"
"20093060","20094640"," buy or a roll down."
"20097580","20099560"," Roll down into right here. "
"20099720","20101340"," This DCA zone right here."
"20101480","20103020"," Right now, still heading higher."
"20104360","20106280"," Still sitting on that 6 CMA. "
"20108940","20109700"," Griding higher."
"20109980","20110860"," Climbing the wall of worry."
"20113350","20116210"," Still have this here as a tag and the day. "
"20116370","20118170"," We'll see if we can grab this little bit right here."
"20121610","20122810"," Now, 10 minutes passed."
"20124850","20130950"," If you're looking to sell, if you're a bear, so if you're a seller, you are trying to sell. "
"20135700","20140760"," If you are a seller here and you're trying to sell, I'm going to give you a couple places to"
"20140760","20141100"," sell."
"20142500","20147540"," First target for you to sell is 444 even."
"20147540","20156620"," And your next target to sell, if it begins to roll, is 438. "
"20157640","20158860"," Let's call it 438."
"20161100","20168260"," So if you can get underneath 438, start selling again with some stops on the upside of that number."
"20169260","20171500"," So there's kind of no man's land here for sellers. "
"20171600","20172600"," Sellers want to be selling."
"20173500","20174880"," Well, it's actually 437."
"20175580","20183460"," I prefer to sell it to sell like 437 and change somewhere below this down here. "
"20183760","20187220"," Somewhere below this starts selling the fuck out of that."
"20187360","20192180"," If we start trading like this right here, we start blasting down here."
"20192660","20193520"," We'll just change it out. "
"20194820","20202080"," If we start blasting down, you'd want to sell any kind of like a breather up here."
"20202080","20203780"," Like that bullshit in there."
"20204320","20205640"," And then you'd enter right there. "
"20207520","20211500"," And that's where your leg is to 428."
"20214100","20216820"," That's your sell leg right there to 428 right down there."
"20221060","20226620"," Otherwise, otherwise, I am looking for this trade right here. "
"20227340","20228920"," And then I'm looking for this bounce."
"20230160","20233100"," And the continuation of 443, 445."
"20235980","20237860"," Now, if you're if you're a bull, right?"
"20238100","20241580"," If you're if you're a bull watching this program or if you're a bear watching this program right"
"20241580","20241880"," now. "
"20243240","20244200"," I'm not on."
"20244660","20246240"," We'll look at SPX really quick."
"20246420","20247360"," We're talking about SPX. "
"20249400","20251060"," More macro side of things."
"20253520","20256040"," Trade in 25 right now and 32."
"20257480","20259480"," Trying to trade this target up here. "
"20260140","20262620"," I can take the money on both of those trades, I will."
"20267430","20271870"," We're going to talk about the fundamental thesis of bulls."
"20273350","20276410"," And the hopes of bears and sellers. "
"20277550","20281870"," Now, we did a program on the 23rd, I think."
"20281870","20286130"," Let me go back and look and see when that program was big and show it to you guys."
"20286710","20288030"," Hold on here, just a second. "
"20293150","20294170"," Let's go over here."
"20301990","20303110"," Where is it?"
"20307860","20308520"," Where am I?"
"20308760","20309140"," Where am I?"
"20309640","20312200"," Videos are all videos are not in the right place."
"20314060","20315000"," Yeah, so this. "
"20315480","20315880"," Hold on here."
"20318540","20320220"," I only had a thousand views."
"20320400","20320740"," That's hilarious. "
"20325520","20326980"," A little second here."
"20333240","20334840"," That's even that's even crazier."
"20336580","20337540"," Okay, so. "
"20338880","20339880"," What am I doing here?"
"20341600","20343320"," I'm gonna bring this down for you guys."
"20343880","20345860"," Oh, yeah."
"20346000","20346800"," Look at that hourly trigger. "
"20347120","20348260"," Turn it around right now."
"20348340","20349060"," Look at that hourly trigger."
"20349220","20349740"," Turn it around. "
"20352660","20355460"," So I'm going to post in the chats."
"20356280","20357540"," Oh, I got to bring these back up."
"20360850","20362550"," Open that tab. "
"20362930","20364650"," Open this in a tab."
"20368950","20370330"," Dude, what is going on here?"
"20376950","20378410"," Get some walking is going on."
"20380970","20382510"," Should have put that in the live chat. "
"20382970","20384650"," I'm going to post a link to this video."
"20386470","20391510"," So this is a video that I posted on, I believe, three weeks ago, the 23rd."
"20391970","20392970"," Watch this later. "
"20393550","20394250"," Only got a thousand views."
"20394690","20396310"," Private stream for the discord."
"20398010","20400870"," Made the stream late night for discorders. "
"20401470","20404450"," It's public now, but there's the stream."
"20406230","20408110"," Trading 26 right now."
"20409450","20416650"," Trading 34 right now in the squeeze higher, trading $4.39.59. Squeezing higher, just climbing the"
"20416650","20417090"," wall of war. "
"20417230","20418530"," And I posted this to you."
"20418770","20427050"," I posted this to you on to just watch this video and where the market was when I played this"
"20427050","20427410"," video."
"20428330","20435850"," And it's important for you to see that video because we were talking about a local top, does it"
"20435850","20437610"," come back down into the daily trigger?"
"20438210","20441030"," Or is it roll into a correction?"
"20441470","20442670"," And do you wake up one day?"
"20443150","20447690"," The idea by this video is don't be surprised if you wake up this week or next week and we"
"20447690","20448870"," are correcting the market. "
"20449650","20454730"," So as we corrected this market, come on, just pay me."
"20456630","20458890"," I don't fucking want 26 cents."
"20458890","20462530"," I don't want 34. "
"20462910","20464770"," I was at the 36 a minute ago in 445."
"20465810","20467350"," Straight this number up here."
"20482880","20489160"," So the idea behind this video is the idea behind where we are, it extends into SPX. "
"20489540","20491300"," So we're going to look at SPX here."
"20492980","20495120"," We're going to go back to a Webull full chart."
"20495320","20497680"," We're going to go back to SPX and review that same chart. "
"20499680","20500740"," Nope, that's SP."
"20503380","20504820"," Let me SPX."
"20507440","20509680"," So SPX in this daily chart here. "
"20510500","20511020"," We went over this."
"20511240","20513520"," We've gone over this now two or three times."
"20514400","20515640"," And you've got a quarter right here. "
"20517500","20519240"," Right in 26 right now."
"20520840","20522420"," Let me get rid of that right there."
"20523040","20524560"," You've got a quarter right here, right?"
"20525240","20525500"," Sorry. "
"20527420","20532260"," You've got a quarter right here, and you've got the dip that got bought right there."
"20533780","20534360"," Right?"
"20534600","20537260"," This did not happen here, did it?"
"20538720","20540940"," We corrected down farther."
"20541700","20542280"," Right?"
"20543120","20547120"," Now if that dip had been bought, you would expect at the end of this quarter to tag those upper"
"20547120","20550000"," targets on SPX and on the collar. "
"20550720","20558620"," Now with this major pullback here, the cluster becomes, well, can we get to the collar at 46.65"
"20558620","20559300"," still?"
"20559560","20560060"," Is it feasible?"
"20560500","20560840"," It is."
"20561420","20562220"," It's feasible."
"20563200","20564780"," It's feasible to get there. "
"20570070","20573530"," It's feasible to fail this all time high back here too."
"20574930","20577130"," And then this is December right here."
"20577270","20579770"," Can you actually get the all time high into December?"
"20581550","20583590"," Right in 27 cents right now. "
"20584970","20590430"," But the key point here is if you're a bull, if you're a bull, if you're a bear listening to"
"20590430","20598790"," me right now, if you're a seller listening to me right now, the bull thesis relies upon this"
"20598790","20599170"," happening."
"20599430","20606370"," They don't care about this failure here, but it relies upon the end of the year, the 31st, getting"
"20606370","20607330"," that all time high."
"20608470","20613070"," Now I'm going to direct your attention back to what makes this important and that's this stuff over"
"20613070","20613470"," here. "
"20614650","20614930"," Right?"
"20615230","20616250"," It's okay to fail this."
"20616870","20621330"," It's okay for Mike Barrie to come up over here and say market crash, market correction."
"20621970","20623550"," We know these guys are coming out. "
"20623610","20624690"," We know they're going to come out here."
"20625110","20632250"," We already know that the Mike Barrie, we've had a video, previous video that said Mike Barrie is"
"20632250","20632890"," going to come out here."
"20632890","20635310"," He's going to come out right here and he's going to come out right here. "
"20636450","20641490"," Every time we come to this point, this point in that point, you're going to see Barrie's and people"
"20641490","20642570"," like him come out of the woodwork."
"20643110","20644990"," We saw Barrie come out the next day."
"20645090","20648470"," I think a day or two later right here and say boom. "
"20649010","20651070"," Yeah, we're going to have a correction, right?"
"20651670","20652810"," Maybe the end of the market."
"20653030","20654970"," This is the top, any of that kind of stuff."
"20655590","20658350"," So bulls for your thesis to play out. "
"20658650","20659470"," You need to come up here."
"20659550","20661630"," You're fine to fill that in the middle of the fall."
"20661630","20665750"," You're actually fine to get up here into beginning of the year. "
"20666530","20668150"," This would keep your thesis alive."
"20668510","20675690"," If you begin to have failures up here, if you're if you're a buyer and you see bullshit like that,"
"20676010","20680330"," you're going to see a deeper low once we get into the fall."
"20680790","20686230"," And you can kiss off any kind of like all time highs in the December 31st that point. "
"20686650","20690690"," And the bare thesis starts to gain some traction."
"20691170","20692170"," Do you understand what I'm saying?"
"20694310","20695990"," I might take I make it out of here."
"20696030","20697430"," I might just close here. "
"20697610","20702590"," I'm not paying attention."
"20703210","20709410"," So the idea being here is if you start saying you can't be a bull and say, oh, we didn't"
"20709410","20712230"," get the failure before all time highs."
"20712350","20713790"," Oh, we didn't get the all time highs. "
"20714170","20715990"," Oh, and we're going to go way up here in 2024."
"20716430","20716830"," Does it make sense?"
"20717530","20719050"," None of that shit plays out for you."
"20719330","20723290"," If you start failing in here, you start doing this bullshit. "
"20723290","20724290"," And bulls get weak."
"20724850","20727250"," You know, you can kiss off 4,000 and 3,800."
"20727530","20730350"," Now you're looking at 3,500, 3,600. "
"20730930","20732810"," You're looking at much steeper lows here."
"20733210","20735270"," And you can kiss all this out way too."
"20735330","20735990"," All that's gone. "
"20736430","20736570"," Garbage."
"20737130","20739250"," All that stuff becomes garbage down the road."
"20739510","20746230"," If you fail to give the reason why bulls think we're going higher down the road. "
"20746630","20749130"," So as we come up here, you're going to expect craziness."
"20749130","20749650"," Absolutely."
"20750630","20752130"," You're going to expect volatilities. "
"20752830","20753130"," We got there."
"20753290","20753630"," Absolutely."
"20753890","20754930"," We did a whole video on this. "
"20755410","20756490"," We did a whole video on."
"20756730","20758150"," You're going to expect volatility."
"20758530","20761790"," You're going to expect violent moves to the upside to get there. "
"20761790","20763870"," They're not going to give it to you free and easy."
"20764250","20766770"," They're not going to say to you, oh, cap, don't worry about it."
"20766770","20767630"," We're just going to go straight up. "
"20767970","20770410"," That's like a bear saying that we're going straight down, right?"
"20770570","20771690"," That's not going to happen."
"20772530","20782370"," Trading $4.39.62. Do I get my $4.39.93 here into this close?"
"20783610","20788030"," So bulls is your thesis broken?"
"20788990","20789750"," No."
"20791030","20791950"," Bolts. "
"20792770","20795830"," Dude, like you don't have a choice."
"20796330","20799130"," Like you literally don't have a choice here."
"20799130","20800950"," You're not going to go into. "
"20801650","20803070"," You're not going to go into."
"20805510","20812070"," Don't think that you're going into the end of Q3 and not getting $4.72. Just don't even think it."
"20812270","20812970"," Like you have to. "
"20813990","20820230"," If you don't get that $4.72, you don't get the $4.65, $4.72. You're not up there going,"
"20820230","20822870"," hey, Ma, look at me top of the world on Q3."
"20823870","20827390"," What do you think happens with the taller for Q4?"
"20830350","20836110"," They're not going $4.80. They're not going to come out with a collar on the end of quarter and"
"20836110","20839430"," be like, yeah, $4.84.90. They're not going to do that."
"20841350","20843510"," And you're not going to get what you want. "
"20843650","20848370"," Even if we get a major pullback in the fall, you're not going to get that $4.80 JPM car."
"20848510","20849170"," And they're going to come out."
"20849270","20854950"," These sellers will come out on the 31st and they're going to 29th, I think, for September. "
"20854950","20859350"," And they're going to come out and tell you, look at this JPM just told you, fuck you."
"20859430","20860190"," Your upside is limited."
"20861510","20862790"," You don't want that. "
"20863990","20867290"," Do not want that heading into Q4."
"20867490","20872250"," Now you can have a big, big nasty like downside target in Q4."
"20872370","20878010"," As long as you got that 480 up there, it'll still be a magnet for you to trade up into. "
"20878010","20885070"," So, and this impacts the thesis for bulls into 2024."
"20885870","20890510"," It impacts the thesis for the downside targets."
"20891870","20896330"," You know, I'm going to assure you, I'm going to warn you of something if you're a bull moment. "
"20896330","20898330"," We know that we're pausing a moment."
"20898330","20907990"," We know we're going to get some, some, some rate cuts down the road."
"20908750","20913010"," And you really want to know like when they, when they've run that road, that role in the"
"20913010","20919030"," marketplace, you're going to need to know the depth of destruction that's coming from that. "
"20919290","20923130"," And the length of the depth of destruction that's coming from that."
"20923490","20928970"," And you don't want to be going into that role in saying, oh, we failed to get all time highs."
"20929930","20931650"," You want to say we got all time highs. "
"20931870","20933010"," I don't care where we go down here."
"20933030","20935110"," It's only going to be a bounce for us to rock it up."
"20936290","20940570"," Examples historically of us not making all time highs don't end well. "
"20941270","20942810"," Like they do not end well."
"20943050","20943970"," There's not many of them."
"20944310","20945550"," There's only a few of them. "
"20945930","20948850"," But there are, but those few that we have are no bueno."
"20949110","20950130"," They're just not good."
"20950870","20953170"," We don't need to hold all time highs either. "
"20953170","20954570"," We just need to go up there and tag it."
"20954790","20958730"," You go up there and tag it and we pull back down and then we're often fucking running again."
"20959750","20961010"," So you don't want to see that. "
"20961170","20962050"," Nobody wants to see that."
"20962230","20965610"," No, like if a seller sees that we don't make all time highs."
"20966170","20970890"," In my brain as a buyer, I already know that if I don't see that shit. "
"20971450","20973990"," That I will sell everything like just start selling."
"20974190","20975190"," Put a fucking nice fat."
"20975650","20978850"," A nice fat. "
"20981110","20985250"," Train against the market for a year out from now and just wait for that low because I know that"
"20985250","20985950"," it's coming, right?"
"20985950","20991450"," A nice big fat put back spread in the marketplace."
"20992190","20996850"," Run that shit for December of 2024 and it's likely going lower than 38."
"20997070","21001650"," It's likely going to 36 or 33 or 32, 35 somewhere nasty. "
"21002330","21005570"," You know, so there's not much time left for bulls."
"21006330","21012170"," And that raises that part of the conversation of just looking at that SPX chart right there, right?"
"21013010","21018470"," Raises the question of is it worth putting that risk on into end of year?"
"21019390","21019970"," Is it?"
"21020770","21022090"," Is it okay to put it on?"
"21022430","21023110"," Yeah, it's okay."
"21023330","21024970"," Is it okay to put everything into it?"
"21025250","21028070"," But no, as of right now, it isn't. "
"21028430","21030010"," You got to get above the daily trigger."
"21030470","21031530"," You got to get above the hour."
"21031710","21035350"," So the price hourly than daily and you got to do it fast. "
"21035610","21037890"," You don't have a lot of time on your hands to do it."
"21038790","21040750"," And sellers want nothing more."
"21040950","21045870"," Anyone with a thesis to the downside or a crash or not a correction, anything. "
"21046070","21046950"," It's like more than a correction."
"21047430","21051650"," Anyone with that, like we're going to 4,000, we're going to roll this over and do the Mike Barry"
"21051650","21057790"," fraud trade failure to get above and then roll it back down and see destructive destruction in the"
"21057790","21058030"," marketplace."
"21058750","21060050"," Those people are looking for that. "
"21060450","21063510"," They don't want to see us trade back up to the previous side."
"21063510","21065110"," They don't want to see you trade 465."
"21065750","21067730"," They don't want to see you trade 472. "
"21068190","21073370"," They're not going to come back up to you afterwards and say we're going to 2,800, right?"
"21074070","21077190"," If you see that stuff, likely not going to happen."
"21077650","21084750"," If you see those prices to the upside, you're likely going to see whatever pullback happens is not"
"21084750","21091270"," going to be as destructive as that 32, 34, 3600."
"21091370","21096330"," You're going to see likely 4,200, 4,000, maybe 3,800 at best. "
"21096910","21100570"," So this is kind of important for you in the bull thesis."
"21101190","21102190"," Sellers know this already."
"21102410","21106710"," I'm hoping I'm assuming that most of them do that they don't want to see us go. "
"21106910","21111790"," They don't want to see us retest, not even retest, but get a new high on the previous side that"
"21111790","21112110"," we had."
"21112110","21113730"," They don't want to see the 465."
"21114270","21116350"," They don't want to see the 472 guaranteed. "
"21116670","21119250"," They don't want to see those things 100% percent."
"21122450","21124870"," I'm telling you right now, the end of this quarter."
"21125770","21127810"," I'm fucking warning you if you're a bull. "
"21128590","21130250"," The end of this quarter matters."
"21130970","21132090"," It fucking matters."
"21132970","21133210"," It matters. "
"21134110","21134550"," It matters."
"21134970","21137050"," It impacts like your end of year."
"21137050","21141130"," It impacts your down late winter price. "
"21141510","21147570"," It impacts your thesis for 2024, 2025."
"21150850","21152430"," It impacts everything."
"21152750","21153590"," It's a pretty big deal. "
"21153970","21156190"," It's not a big deal we broke daily."
"21157170","21158730"," We haven't broken weekly yet."
"21159230","21162630"," Daily did not come down with price, which is good to see. "
"21163610","21164710"," You don't have time."
"21165470","21166850"," You're a fucking bull, man."
"21167170","21170750"," You're the guy that I don't know. "
"21171590","21172690"," You're left-footed."
"21173130","21176810"," You're not following through right now as you should."
"21178070","21180130"," I have high expectations, by the way. "
"21180210","21181890"," I'm not a low expectation person."
"21184010","21185810"," Every pullback better get bought."
"21188070","21189530"," That is a big thing, right?"
"21190090","21194190"," If you're a buyer or seller's market, you're looking for these things. "
"21195070","21197690"," You're looking for these things into the end of this quarter."
"21197890","21204010"," You're looking for these things into setting up the rest of the year."
"21206550","21207690"," Where are we headed?"
"21208330","21209670"," Where's the grand pieces here?"
"21210450","21211270"," It wasn't a good look. "
"21212190","21215510"," It wasn't a good look for bulls to give that much up."
"21216530","21219650"," It's not a good look looking at..."
"21220330","21222530"," Dad tends to choose them like, man, not so much."
"21223350","21225150"," It's not like your time is burning. "
"21225770","21230990"," By the time they do pause rates or bring them down or cut rates, your time is burning."
"21231290","21236210"," You don't have that time as a buyer, and you need reasons for the market to go up."
"21236390","21239610"," You need a reason for that market to go up there. "
"21239810","21243810"," Some belief that we're near the end."
"21243810","21249330"," I don't know if that happens in this meeting this week that gets reinstilled."
"21250330","21257430"," I don't know that Jerome wants this market lower than back to 3500. "
"21259210","21262390"," He probably knows that he's setting that up right now too."
"21263250","21266850"," Does he know that you want to bring the market sideways?"
"21266850","21273930"," You want to trade the market sideways and down in sideways and sideways and up as long as you can."
"21274150","21279410"," His ultimate plan is for that to happen to trade this market sideways for longer. "
"21279750","21286750"," It's the greatest gift given to our market is to trade it sideways for multiple years, two, three"
"21286750","21287030"," years."
"21287910","21294990"," It limits the downside damage even though it's a stagnant market."
"21296710","21300230"," It reduces volatility in the marketplace on a grander scale. "
"21301350","21303510"," That big rubber band effect that we end up having."
"21304030","21305390"," Does he want to talk it down?"
"21305690","21305850"," Yes."
"21306190","21309330"," Does he is this close enough in horse shoes and hand grenades?"
"21310450","21310450"," Probably. "
"21311910","21316630"," But he knows he's going to have to come out either in this meeting on Thursday, Friday, Wednesday,"
"21316970","21322310"," Thursday, Friday and talk it down right where we are to get it down to that 3500."
"21323230","21328650"," Or he knows that if we get up to the 4700, he's going to have to slam it down into"
"21328650","21329690"," that 3800."
"21330970","21335590"," Inside of those two question marks is, well, if we trade, let's we crash it right now. "
"21336410","21340110"," Does it open up the door to a major market crash?"
"21340510","21341810"," They don't want that either."
"21342510","21350410"," I know you think that they want that, but they likely do not want to see us trade below 35"
"21350410","21352190"," and then start looking for 1600."
"21352890","21354410"," I don't think that's the intent at least. "
"21355470","21359150"," So it's, I think it's a very like complicated thing for them to do."
"21359290","21364230"," I think it's, I think it's easy here to do it and be able to pull the market back up."
"21364630","21368090"," I think it's easier to sell a major sell at 472. "
"21369950","21378970"," It even 4800 4800 somewhere in there to do a major sell to the downside and have that bottom be"
"21378970","21382810"," higher than the 3450 that previous low."
"21383050","21389130"," I think they want that bounce in that 3500 3600 to continue to trade sideways and up."
"21389830","21391770"," Now we are pretty close, right?"
"21392170","21393450"," Last week we were pretty close. "
"21394210","21395510"," I mean, what's 170 points?"
"21396510","21397050"," Not a whole lot."
"21397230","21403570"," What's the risk though, if we trade below that 3500 is when you start to bring in these major lows,"
"21403570","21409570"," like 26, 16 again, 14 again, mass paranoia, all that kind of stuff."
"21409770","21412750"," And you need catalysts for that too. "
"21413810","21415870"," What are those catalysts to make that happen?"
"21417490","21420230"," You can't, you're not just going to trade it without catalysts, right?"
"21420450","21423310"," So it's like Jerome's going to look down the road and be like, well, if we start trading down"
"21423310","21429470"," there, what catalysts are there to send us to start crashing this market even harder and heavier."
"21431470","21433330"," Trading 23 cents right now."
"21434050","21435810"," Get a little bit of a roll in this close. "
"21436290","21438650"," Still long for calls for tomorrow and Wednesday."
"21439590","21443050"," Want to see that $4.39.93 get traded if we can trade it to this bell."
"21444070","21448810"," If we do trade this right now, I'm going to end up taking those calls off the table and be"
"21448810","21450010"," flat into tomorrow. "
"21451110","21452890"," We'll see how this works itself out."
"21453550","21456530"," Now 32 past the hour coming into the close."
"21463660","21466400"," Yeah, the importance, it's very important. "
"21466760","21470780"," So you're talking like major fundamental changes."
"21472560","21478420"," Major fundamental changes in the expectations of where the market goes."
"21494700","21496120"," Yeah, put back spread. "
"21497120","21499480"," You get a failure of 472, 480."
"21499480","21503540"," It's like a giant fucking put back spread for the whole year of 2024."
"21510950","21513170"," Like a lot of your ex boyfriends. "
"21515030","21517590"," I'm reading the I'm not seeing the entire chat here."
"21517970","21519950"," For some reason, I'm only seeing the Twitch chat."
"21520170","21521110"," I don't know why that is. "
"21521210","21522110"," I'm going to refresh the chat."
"21523150","21524810"," I'm not seeing the YouTube chat at all."
"21525090","21525610"," Like zero. "
"21526610","21529230"," I'm on YouTube right now going to see what those guys are saying."
"21529230","21532690"," I missed the entire YouTube chat today."
"21532830","21533250"," I'm only reading. "
"21533250","21534810"," I don't know why I'm only reading Twitch."
"21535350","21536850"," Maybe I'm signed in on the wrong."
"21537270","21538910"," I think I have to switch my sign in. "
"21539750","21541110"," So that I can see both chats."
"21543390","21549950"," Trade 26 and 34 right now and 443's and 445's."
"21550750","21552950"," Give me a big ass fucking payday today. "
"21558680","21564020"," Yeah, I was going to do some some more."
"21565560","21568380"," Some more earnings plays for the close to today."
"21569500","21570720"," Hold on a second here. "
"21587860","21590080"," Eli Lilly just keeps on trucking."
"21594060","21595180"," Let's get a little."
"21595620","21599940"," As long as you're above 546, you're happy. "
"21601740","21611720"," It's got"
"21611720","21613040"," a little more up to go."
"21644860","21647320"," You already tagged 560."
"21650610","21659150"," Eli Lilly truthfully close to a cell. "
"21676750","21677790"," Cell 570."
"21686850","21687890"," Eli Lilly self."
"21688230","21690270"," I think the short is better here than the by. "
"21691710","21706960"," One tag."
"21707120","21708380"," One, two, three, four tag."
"21709100","21709620"," 565. "
"21710780","21711920"," Man, I don't know."
"21714140","21717280"," The reason why I'm saying cell 570 is right here."
"21719920","21721560"," Pretty close to a top. "
"21721560","21722860"," Pretty close."
"21726800","21728060"," That's a tough one, man."
"21732890","21734790"," And it can still grind too. "
"21736190","21737370"," You know, I'll come up this."
"21738330","21739330"," I'll give you 600."
"21741590","21746510"," I think you can grind 600, but I think it's still a cell. "
"21746510","21749330"," So I said 570."
"21750190","21750550"," 600."
"21750930","21752390"," I think it just grinds and then sells. "
"21765430","21768130"," By August 30th, I think you hit it and then you sell it."
"21770390","21771110"," Eli Lilly."
"21775430","21776550"," Do I think you can get there?"
"21776670","21776850"," I do. "
"21778010","21780430"," I think you can get there, but it's going to be tight, man."
"21781650","21783130"," It's going to be tight, dude."
"21785070","21786110"," It's going to be tight. "
"21789450","21791050"," I think you get six, I do."
"21793430","21795670"," It's a better long term short."
"21798230","21799790"," I know that's crazy to say. "
"21804790","21807450"," Still long for calls for tomorrow Wednesday."
"21825320","21827280"," Calls just stagnant right now."
"21827460","21830120"," No real, no real, no real, not really making any money here. "
"21830120","21832140"," Just kind of like fucking around doing nothing."
"21836740","21838020"," Give me the squeeze, baby."
"21839060","21839820"," Squeeze this bell. "
"21844130","21844690"," Oh, yeah."
"21845950","21846630"," Can we get that one?"
"21847710","21848370"," Can we get that today?"
"21851330","21854250"," Can we squeeze this one right?"
"21854470","21855410"," Can we get this one in here today?"
"21855590","21856490"," Can we get 443 today?"
"21857690","21858190"," Can I get 443?"
"21858870","21860670"," Like, just do it right now on a Monday."
"21864170","21866390"," You're going to give me, you're going to give me 443 today. "
"21866590","21867670"," You're going to, you're going to print them today."
"21870330","21871690"," We'll leave them right there just in case."
"21874630","21874990"," Yeah. "
"21878830","21879710"," Now I see YouTube."
"21880010","21882010"," Now I see YouTubers on my chat."
"21886510","21887630"," Now I see YouTubers. "
"21893380","21899260"," Thanks for following Black and Stolen Stolar."
"21900340","21901420"," Stolar, I don't know."

"21907200","21908840"," They gave me a fucking penny."
"21910880","21913040"," They gave me a penny on my calls for tomorrow."
"21913420","21913460"," Thanks. "
"21913700","21914440"," Thanks, that dealers."

"21931520","21934380"," Trade 28 and 36 right now."
"21936420","21937560"," He's out there."
"21943080","21946940"," Taking 37 cents and 29 cents. "
"21949200","21954820"," For tomorrow and Wednesday."
"21955540","21963430"," Play right now."
"21968140","21969920"," Chef's Kiss. "
"21970520","21975080"," One penny higher."

"21979340","21989260"," Good to see"
"21989260","21989620"," you, Jared. "
"21989900","21990240"," How are you?"
"21991300","21992560"," R2 to the upside."
"21993020","21993960"," 44025."
"21995740","22004880"," We have 440.97. 441.50. And 442.94."
"22006280","22007560"," Oh, yeah. "
"22007560","22013790"," Oh, yeah."
"22014610","22015710"," Can we keep squeezing?"
"22017660","22019870"," Another target to the upside right now."
"22022090","22022830"," 44061. "
"22024150","22025310"," Right up here."
"22026490","22027670"," New target to the upside."
"22030070","22030330"," Right there. "
"22033780","22034520"," 44061."
"22045800","22047820"," Be careful after the bell here."
"22047820","22050560"," If they roll this over, remember they did that last week. "
"22051740","22052740"," On Tuesday."
"22053340","22055360"," Don't hesitate to take profit here."
"22056140","22058740"," Congratulations if you're making money with us all day long today. "
"22063250","22065370"," Trade 44011 right now."
"22065670","22067150"," Trying to trade 44025."
"22067990","22069790"," Pay attention to this one right here. "
"22072670","22073230"," 44025."
"22094990","22097130"," Thanks for following their good and Ramsey official."
"22100110","22100930"," Appreciate that. "
"22104770","22107470"," What do I think about ZM and TER?"
"22113890","22114530"," Zoom."
"22115830","22117090"," Toiling right now."
"22124970","22126050"," Let's take a look. "
"22131440","22133420"," What do I think about zoom?"
"22138420","22139300"," Um, bearish."
"22140940","22142420"," Oh, my truthful answer."
"22143240","22143880"," I'm bearish. "
"22146740","22148700"," I'm bearish on zoom into their ER."
"22151420","22151960"," Hold on."
"22152080","22153440"," Let me look somewhere else and take a look. "
"22155120","22155560"," Sorry."
"22156620","22157920"," That's not what you wanted to hear."
"22162180","22163560"," Let me look at it right here. "
"22163560","22163980"," Hold on."
"22167700","22169340"," I mean, it looks bull."
"22169600","22171820"," No, that's, that's, no, no, no. "
"22171900","22172820"," That's fucking oil."
"22173140","22173940"," That's my oil trade."
"22176700","22178920"," I want to talk about the oil trade right now. "
"22180360","22183020"," I see the squeeze potential on it."
"22186970","22188190"," Oh, dude, man."
"22188510","22189330"," I'm telling you, dude. "
"22191850","22193230"," I know this."
"22196730","22197750"," I know it."
"22197870","22199890"," I know what your feeling is. "
"22200030","22202170"," You're like, Oh, dude, we're already at the lows, right?"
"22203230","22206070"," So the opening price on it was $63."
"22208230","22208750"," Dude."
"22209410","22211910"," It needs a flush, dude. "
"22212390","22213210"," It needs a reprising."
"22215830","22216550"," It needs to be reevaluated."
"22216550","22218770"," It needs to be like $20 or $30. "
"22219450","22225450"," It needs that."
"22225690","22228030"," It needs to trade $40."
"22229450","22230110"," It does. "
"22230850","22233750"," Those people that are in zoom from $63, $61."
"22234510","22236930"," There's other people that are in way lower than that."
"22237190","22242050"," So it's here. "
"22242170","22242910"," We'll look at it real quick."
"22243090","22243590"," Hold on a second."
"22246630","22247770"," I'm fly right now. "
"22247910","22249690"," So you guys decide what you're going to do."
"22250270","22251470"," We're going to go over to zoom real quick."
"22252230","22254890"," I think we're going to go over to zoom right now. "
"22258930","22259650"," That's not zoom."
"22262350","22263290"," We're going to look at zoom."
"22269940","22271480"," I'm just looking at this right here. "
"22271660","22273560"," I'm like, yeah, I'm like bullish."
"22275280","22276560"," There's some problems."
"22277560","22278320"," There's some problems. "
"22280660","22284120"," I don't like the daily underneath the weekly."
"22284440","22284620"," Sorry."
"22285360","22285440"," I don't. "
"22285840","22287520"," I like price above the hourly."
"22290200","22291200"," That's all good."
"22292980","22294620"," Don't mind this trade right here. "
"22294880","22295480"," Don't mind it."
"22296120","22296980"," Trade to 68."
"22297300","22297740"," Don't mind it. "
"22299500","22301140"," Big picture thesis stuff."
"22303320","22305260"," Price being under the daily and weekly."
"22305720","22306540"," The saying bearish. "
"22307220","22307760"," That's what it's saying."
"22308940","22310060"," Saying sell sell sell."
"22310240","22310640"," That's what it's saying. "
"22312980","22316060"," If I look at a daily chart on it."
"22316780","22319660"," This is like the big big boy picture stuff."
"22327830","22329510"," This is what I don't like here. "
"22330030","22335980"," I don't like watching monthly heading lower."
"22336380","22338360"," I don't like weekly heading lower."
"22338480","22339640"," I don't like daily heading lower. "
"22340600","22342800"," And I don't like this initial buy in back here."
"22343480","22347800"," Because it makes me wonder if you could trigger some stops in here."
"22349160","22351300"," Can't excel all these people back here. "
"22352020","22354820"," And just get a nice sexy better price."
"22355980","22356700"," Lower."
"22357280","22360560"," So seems like a perfect opportunity to do that. "
"22361400","22362300"," Seems like it."
"22365560","22368280"," So am I bearish on it?"
"22368400","22369240"," Not necessarily."
"22369240","22371280"," But what I am looking at here is. "
"22372120","22376020"," Unless price is above $70 and 11 cents."
"22378420","22380940"," I would love to buy it."
"22381740","22382300"," Love. "
"22383160","22384540"," To buy it down here."
"22385060","22385620"," 40 bucks."
"22386160","22388060"," I would love to buy that. "
"22388880","22392580"," Completely unexpected by a bull's bulls are probably like, yeah, that ain't never happening."
"22394140","22395340"," Never going to have a cap."
"22396120","22397900"," So my take here would be. "
"22399020","22402840"," All that trend down into November to 40 bucks."
"22403660","22406000"," And then hopefully catch that dip down there."
"22406000","22408400"," That's what I would love to buy is something like that. "
"22408580","22409360"," Just like buying that."
"22409480","22410280"," Just like buying that."
"22410940","22412440"," Just like buying that right there. "
"22412900","22415500"," Now, if they have a good ER and they bounce above."
"22416320","22417320"," You want it to long it."
"22418300","22422360"," On a good ER, long it over $70 and you'll start closing out. "
"22423420","22424900"," All that big boy stuff."
"22425120","22426680"," You could also trade this with like."
"22427920","22429300"," Put spread down at $40. "
"22430060","22430940"," Some time on it."
"22431640","22432760"," Put some time on it."
"22432760","22435780"," And you could also do like, oh, this might be a good ER. "
"22436200","22436600"," All right."
"22436820","22439160"," So we're going to trade what?"
"22439300","22439700"," A hundred bucks."
"22440580","22443160"," Maybe put a month call out on a hundred bucks on it. "
"22443900","22445120"," Both sides of that trade."
"22446280","22447160"," Personally, I'd like that."
"22447300","22447920"," I'd like that deal. "
"22449520","22450820"," On zoom, ZM."
"22456240","22457540"," Yeah, that's what I don't like."
"22457700","22458540"," I saw that news. "
"22459760","22461560"," I saw that news about zoom."
"22461940","22462940"," That shit is not."
"22463180","22463860"," You don't want to see that. "
"22464660","22467500"," When they drop that information when they were like."
"22468820","22471140"," Well, let me bring you back to the regular screener here."
"22474670","22477110"," When they like, so you're going to get. "
"22478330","22479670"," You're going to get like."
"22480810","22483470"," So I always like using this example."
"22484070","22486630"," I always like using the example of. "
"22487030","22488630"," Oh, Samuel Adams."
"22490710","22493210"," Samuel Adams went into their earnings report."
"22493850","22496630"," With no update to guidance. "
"22498550","22499030"," So."
"22500450","22504070"," They just come out came out like, oh, by the way, we sold everything."
"22504130","22505850"," And now we're going to tell you that. "
"22507190","22508770"," Zima didn't work at dinner."
"22509630","22514250"," It only works when people are golfing or they're with their wives and hanging out with their"
"22514250","22515010"," boyfriends."
"22515530","22519190"," Boy friends like dreaming that drinking that shit when they're hanging out in their garage with"
"22519190","22520090"," their neighbors and shit. "
"22520090","22522750"," We couldn't get people to convert to that."
"22522850","22525550"," They still want to have a Manhattan or a martini."
"22526170","22529470"," Or they want to drink a nice beer in a restaurant, right?"
"22529610","22531470"," A craft beer from your local brewery. "
"22533310","22533790"," So."
"22535370","22540350"," That it's it's kind of like that article about how they were forcing their own employees back to"
"22540350","22540510"," work."
"22541070","22542210"," It's kind of like. "
"22543010","22546330"," Sam Adams not telling you, but they are telling you."
"22546330","22548630"," They're saying, forcing all of our people back to work."
"22548630","22551150"," We're going to let you know that right now because we're probably going to talk about that. "
"22551430","22553010"," We're going to be asked those questions in our guidance."
"22556570","22558570"," So you don't want to see, you don't want to see that."
"22558650","22560030"," That's kind of like a tip of the hat saying. "
"22560810","22564430"," Yeah, maybe, you know, maybe expect some more down here."
"22564550","22564690"," So."
"22566570","22571750"," Now does that mean let's say zoom has their earnings and their stellar and they start ripping face. "
"22572270","22575130"," You can buy fucking, you can buy the underlying at 72 bucks."
"22575650","22576910"," Have a blast with it."
"22577070","22578030"," We'll start riding up. "
"22578070","22581190"," You can buy calls the next day and I pull back and you're off and running."
"22582570","22584690"," I see the setup that you're talking about."
"22585150","22586150"," Like I see the bush. "
"22587230","22587930"," Set up here, right?"
"22588050","22588650"," We're at the bottom."
"22589530","22590210"," Blasted up."
"22590650","22591910"," But I always loved it. "
"22592030","22593310"," Who did that this year?"
"22593490","22593670"," It was."
"22595870","22597330"," Who was it that did it this year?"
"22597470","22597670"," It was."
"22598850","22599650"," AMD, right?"
"22599810","22600270"," Was it AMD?"
"22601230","22602710"," I think Winky and I were talking about AMD. "
"22602710","22607190"," We're like, yeah, it's like the most shorted stock in the market right now."
"22607870","22608570"," It was."
"22608710","22612410"," It was like three days to cover largest short in the market. "
"22613130","22618550"," And they didn't talk about AI and their ER, right?"
"22619050","22622890"," And sure enough, it was because it had such a large short on it."
"22623250","22625630"," It just ripped faces down to the depths of hell."
"22625890","22626990"," What happened three days later?"
"22627690","22628530"," It was like three days later. "
"22628990","22631630"," It was like the same setup, like same setup."
"22631630","22632750"," It was like blast down."
"22633290","22634470"," They bought the cheap. "
"22635170","22638730"," And then it went rip and faces like three days later."
"22639290","22640850"," So just the setup."
"22641370","22642270"," I get the setup. "
"22642470","22646010"," The bull's thesis here for like price wise where it's at."
"22647090","22651090"," You don't expect like a long time investor to sell now."
"22652850","22654630"," But you know how this shit happens, right?"
"22654870","22656370"," Just like boom, slams down. "
"22656530","22657870"," You're like, oh shit, we're trading 40 bucks."
"22658970","22660550"," We're trading 50, 60."
"22661210","22663030"," And in three weeks, we're down to fucking 40. "
"22663310","22665270"," And you guys should have bought that 40 and not that 70."
"22670160","22671700"," Yeah, the ending work from home."
"22672980","22675560"," That's kind of like the Budweiser guy or that's about right. "
"22675640","22676980"," The Samuel Adams guys coming out."
"22677320","22679200"," Had they come out early and said."
"22680140","22682940"," Yeah, you know, that Zima shit's not working out for us. "
"22686900","22689160"," Okay, so let's go on to this close right now."

"23121920","23122520"," Hold on here. "
"23125670","23130290"," So this is the ES chart for overnight so you can see it."
"23132610","23133510"," Get rid of that."
"23133670","23134430"," See you can see that. "
"23137350","23145280"," It looks so nasty on a look so nasty on a right like the spy chart looks so nasty."
"23146080","23147100"," Just in the overnight."

"23159860","23160800"," I'm concerned of. "
"23161420","23164900"," Could see some sound coming in the overnight nine a.m. That's the actual buy."
"23165940","23166580"," Just be careful here."
"23166620","23169460"," If you only trade cash market and can't touch this right here. "
"23170080","23171520"," You can't hedge this in futures."
"23172320","23173800"," Be wary of it because this could be."
"23174140","23176340"," You know nine thirty in the morning something like that. "
"23176840","23178360"," Let's look at the time frame here."
"23179560","23182100"," So that's a Monday at eighteen hundred."
"23184320","23185680"," Nineteen twenty one hundred. "
"23185880","23187600"," Yeah, I'm going to give it to the bulls here."
"23188680","23189420"," By open."
"23192800","23196600"," Definitely don't want to see the bears come in though and sell this shit down at six a.m. So"
"23196600","23199200"," if you can't do anything that I would say to you here. "
"23199640","23201200"," Anything to say here if you're a bull."
"23202080","23204060"," Would be your safest trade."
"23207740","23210280"," Your safest trade is the open tomorrow. "
"23211380","23214360"," If you want to be bullish on tomorrow your safest trade is."
"23214760","23215720"," The opening bell."
"23216820","23218640"," Not the gap up in the overnight. "
"23218900","23221840"," They're going to try to sell this on the open tomorrow at a forty one."
"23222460","23223620"," Forty three ninety seven."
"23223760","23225020"," You're going to see him try to sell that. "
"23233980","23237500"," Just because it like make sure that you're not trading your whole account with that shit."
"23239100","23244380"," Be really careful."
"23245680","23247300"," Yeah, six a.m. be really careful. "
"23249100","23251260"," Your your better trade is likely."
"23254980","23259820"," Your best trade is likely going to be right down here on like if this holds."
"23260100","23261020"," So if this was tomorrow. "
"23261840","23263000"," I can look at this."
"23266320","23270500"," You're like safest trade is a bull is going to be if they sell this bull shit."
"23270500","23274480"," And you and you can buy this right here right on the open. "
"23275140","23278400"," What you don't want to do is wake up at six a.m. and they're like yeah fuck you were"
"23278400","23279060"," going down here."
"23280020","23284020"," We're going to retest all that nonsense down there to race the entire move from today."
"23285320","23288360"," So if you're like coming into the open by and this is probably a better trade. "
"23289100","23293100"," This gap up I did a four forty for tomorrow's dangerous dangerous trade."
"23293680","23294960"," A minute right now I've got him."
"23295620","23297440"," I've got some calls for tomorrow not a ton. "
"23297680","23298420"," So it's not a big position."
"23299260","23303720"," We'll see see how we open tomorrow what's my expectations for us though for tomorrow."
"23304620","23308300"," That we open doing this shit tomorrow right up in there. "

"23325200","23325460"," again."

"23332780","23333460"," motion of things."
"23333460","23335420"," I feel good today made good money today. "
"23335520","23339720"," So I'm pretty happy with the end of the day at this point have some money to piss away."

"23365240","23368340"," I'm going to I'm going to do a series on."
"23370840","23372180"," On trading futures. "
"23373480","23377080"," So if you want to trade futures if you've never traded futures."
"23378240","23379540"," You've never traded futures."
"23380040","23381740"," If you only trade cash market. "
"23382600","23385160"," I'm going to do a quick video or two."
"23385180","23389260"," Maybe just live stream on how to trade futures how to try Globex."
"23390640","23392660"," Basic trading futures and Globex. "
"23392780","23394080"," I might start trading futures."
"23396080","23397180"," With you guys."
"23399900","23402800"," Then in the next week or two but I don't know if it's going to come together. "
"23403100","23404140"," No, no guarantee here."
"23404520","23407340"," If it does happen and I can do that with you guys."
"23407340","23409160"," I'll trade futures with you for like a week or two. "
"23410020","23411420"," And we'll trade that."
"23411700","23413920"," You guys need you guys to hedge futures."
"23414480","23415440"," You can't edge futures. "
"23415940","23418560"," Just trade cash market kind of like left footed."
"23419060","23421560"," So I'll see you guys tomorrow at nine thirty in the morning."
"23422320","23423180"," Be there man. "
"23423620","23424100"," See you then."
"23426680","23428300"," If you don't have a few."
"23428580","23430900"," Can you guys actually trade futures in Robinhood. "
"23430960","23431600"," I don't think you can."
"23432040","23434440"," Are you guys just trading like options or something."
"23435380","23437780"," Can you guys trade futures in Robinhood. "
"23438240","23439540"," Anybody want to answer that for me."
"23440360","23441620"," I tried to find out."
"23441760","23443840"," I was like I'll move money over to Robinhood for these guys. "
"23445560","23447400"," I wasn't sure if you could or couldn't."
"23449060","23450380"," What are you guys trading like."
"23451680","23455280"," Are you guys trading like options on the futures contract or something. "
"23456400","23458320"," I don't know exactly what the fuck they're doing over there."
"23462310","23464530"," I keep hearing them say something about."
"23466110","23469830"," Yeah, I keep hearing people saying that you can trade futures on Robinhood or some shit like that. "
"23469970","23470730"," I don't know if that's true."
"23472470","23476750"," So I trade futures right now and tasty and I was going to leave some money on tasty."
"23476750","23483830"," To trade futures with you guys for like three days five days something like that. "
"23486130","23486690"," Look it."
"23487270","23489710"," So yeah, you guys can do it on find a find a."
"23489710","23494590"," Find a platform throw like I don't know five grand or something on a."
"23495370","23496330"," Platform three."
"23496470","23499870"," I think you can trade the micros with like three to five grand. "
"23500310","23501190"," Something like that."
"23501430","23501990"," You should be good."
"23505350","23508950"," So they're offering 24 hour trading on certain stocks now I think. "
"23509470","23512550"," So yeah, so Casey is saying something that I think is true."
"23513350","23517050"," I think they're allowing you to trade like options against."
"23518290","23522390"," Futures contracts on like an unlike a specific ETN. "
"23522650","23525090"," Like an or an ETN ETF that like mimics."
"23526670","23529510"," I'm wrong in that like options on futures or something."
"23529730","23530890"," I don't know exactly what the fuck it is. "
"23535080","23537000"," Yeah, my methodology is a lot different."
"23537620","23543400"," All I need to know is so the reason why futures traders watch this show is not because."
"23544420","23545640"," Of the ups and downs. "
"23546040","23547640"," They know the direction is pretty much right."
"23547640","23550660"," So it's way features is easier."
"23551300","23552040"," Easier trading. "
"23553940","23555560"," Oh, there's caveats to that."
"23556400","23558340"," There if it goes against, you don't have stops."
"23558380","23559280"," You don't get a fill. "
"23560220","23561760"," You can you'll be walking this."
"23561940","23564100"," You'll be walking up and down the street for a week or two panicking."
"23564720","23566420"," There's more risk in futures. "
"23568480","23571340"," We'll have a whole thing and run it all down for you."
"23571480","23573740"," So there's like a whole thing behind like."
"23575080","23575980"," Carry costs. "
"23576320","23578220"," There's problems with like whoever."
"23578540","23580540"," Let's say you're buying dips and we don't go back up again."
"23580840","23582240"," You get caught upside down in a trade. "
"23582880","23583720"," It can be devastating."
"23591030","23595670"," Yeah, I'm I've trade futures, but I don't normally talk about it in stream, but I'm moving."
"23595930","23602650"," So the reason I'm saying the reason I'm willing to do this is because I'm moving my options trading"
"23602650","23603710"," to a prime bank. "
"23605490","23609370"," And I'm I still have some money in a future and a margin account with."
"23612490","23614450"," Tasty trade and I'm like, yeah."
"23616090","23618030"," I'm like, do I move that to or do I."
"23619690","23622650"," I've never had a problem with fills on tasty with futures. "
"23622650","23626650"," So I'm like, maybe I leave that there and I trade that like a do a series on it or"
"23626650","23626830"," something."
"23629550","23632530"," I think for the micro, I think three to five grand will be enough."
"23633710","23636190"," Somewhere in there, three to five thousand to start trade micros. "
"23637010","23640350"," Maybe someone else could chime in and then say that's not enough for."
"23642090","23645550"," I'm usually trying to scalp futures mostly."
"23650010","23652390"," Yeah, three to five three to five thousand dollars. "
"23652570","23653530"," I think you'd be fine trading."
"23653890","23655570"," Yes, we could trade on Q two."
"23657370","23659010"," I'm not opposed to trading either. "
"23659010","23661570"," So we'll talk about that in a coming week or so."
"23662410","23666810"," I'm actually trying to move some money into a futures account on tasty right now to it."
"23666850","23667630"," It's not going well. "
"23668170","23671710"," I guess my ask my wife to like, I was like, can you move all this money for me?"
"23672790","23674930"," And I'm going to need this over here and that over there."
"23675150","23678110"," My wife is doing it like a C H or some shit."
"23679810","23685110"," And I don't want to talk about this stuff, but the ACH is now going through like platter or"
"23685110","23685490"," something. "
"23686610","23690130"," And so it's like, it's like fucking like two weeks."
"23691130","23692770"," It's not like three to five days."
"23692890","23694350"," It's like five, ten days. "
"23695530","23697110"," I don't know what the fuck is going on."
"23703360","23706100"," So I'll see you guys on tomorrow at nine thirty in the morning."
"23706540","23707780"," I'm still sitting these calls. "
"23708020","23708400"," I'm like, eh."
"23709680","23711760"," You have five minutes left to decide if I hold them."
"23712480","23713840"," I do this shit all the time. "
"23714080","23716180"," I'm like, eh, like, it's four fifteen."
"23716420","23718860"," Am I going to cut them, cut them loose and just start again tomorrow?"
"23724940","23725680"," That's what I think."
"23725780","23732040"," I think three to five thousand is enough for the micro. "
"23732540","23734480"," There's a U six right now or something like that."
"23738380","23740820"," So that's actually not a bad sign calls we can value."
"23747050","23750880"," I'm going to throw some more on right now. "
"23750960","23751160"," Hold on."
"23752720","23760820"," I'm going to buy some more here."
"23763840","23764840"," Thanks for saying something. "
"23766520","23767160"," No, no."
"23767360","23774000"," So normally when I transfer money, it's two, three days without wiring money to accounts, usually"
"23774000","23774680"," two, three days."
"23775620","23777040"," And then I called my broker this week. "
"23777180","23781920"," I was trying to move from brokerage to brokerage and they were like, that's all plaid shit."
"23782640","23784340"," They're like, it's going to take longer than expected."
"23785120","23787040"," So we'll see to the fuck's going on. "
"23787460","23787720"," All right."
"23787720","23790220"," I'll see you guys tomorrow at nine thirty in the morning."
"23790840","23793080"," Let's keep that and keep that in mind that future stuff. "
"23793140","23796360"," You guys want to open a margin account somewhere."
"23796460","23801340"," If you don't already trade futures, we'll trade some futures together."
"23801760","23805120"," The easy, the nice part about futures is you like it's going that way. "
"23805420","23807420"," You don't care about those bumps along the way."
"23808000","23813680"," Just like long with some stops, raise stops and we'll get out of a role of turn turns turns on"
"23813680","23813840"," us."
"23814500","23815760"," So I'll see all of you guys tomorrow. "
"23816340","23818860"," Definitely not the same, but you know, you'll make as much money though."
"23818860","23821320"," Or you risk more to me."
"23821620","23822340"," That's hard to explain. "
"23824340","23826200"," You would define risk and options."
"23826560","23828120"," If they burn on me, they burn on me."
"23828240","23831620"," If this if futures turns on me, getting a fucking phone call, right?"
"23832400","23833400"," One way or another. "
"23833540","23834460"," So we got to talk about that."
"23835260","23836800"," Yeah, no, that's the one good part."
"23836880","23838980"," No, no, no, no, no. "
"23838980","23839360"," All right. "
