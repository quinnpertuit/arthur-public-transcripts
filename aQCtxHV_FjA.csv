"aQCtxHV_FjA","263000","264000"," Definitely."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","264000","265000"," Let's scroll back up here."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","265000","266000"," Go back to the beginning now."

"aQCtxHV_FjA","273000","275000"," This is a wild night, huh?"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","275000","277000"," I was spooked last night."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","277000","280000"," I can't tell you that I wasn't."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","280000","282000"," I was definitely spooked."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","282000","283000"," Good morning, Chris."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","283000","284000"," Stuff."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","284000","285000"," Steven."

"aQCtxHV_FjA","289000","290000"," Hoon."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","290000","291000"," Okay, so here's a deal this morning."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","291000","293000"," We're going to get through some real quick stuff before they open."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","293000","296000"," I need you guys to understand some stuff this morning."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","296000","300000"," First of all, we've been talking all week long about having a plan."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","300000","304000"," You saw me buy that clothes on Monday, I think, and we went way up."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","304000","310000"," You saw me saying to you all week long to wait for you to get your buy in, right?"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","310000","311000"," Through research."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","311000","315000"," So you're looking for your moments to buy into this market."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","315000","317000"," You've had all these charts this week."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","317000","320000"," I'm going to show you these charts this morning."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","320000","321000"," Hang tight here."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","321000","322000"," Hold on."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","322000","328000"," See if I can get this to not be so wonky."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","328000","331000"," So you guys have seen down here."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","331000","333000"," This is the positive gamma area."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","333000","335000"," This is the negative gamma or area."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","335000","336000"," I've got these."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","336000","337000"," These are wrong."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","337000","338000"," This is positive."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","338000","340000"," All this is positive gamma."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","340000","342000"," This is the negative gamma down below."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","342000","349000"," I misspoke, but we've talked about where we have buy ins here, here and down below here all week long that we want them."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","349000","352000"," We have the price to come to us like the smart money does."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","352000","362000"," Now, having that plan in advance, it gives you the opportunity to not be stressed under pressure in the moment to start buying in."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","362000","364000"," So you're not going to be as aggressive here."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","364000","370000"," You're going to get more aggressive here and then even even more aggressive down below at that 4,600."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","370000","373000"," Now things change yesterday after clothes."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","373000","376000"," Some things change that I made a video about that last night."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","376000","387000"," It's important for you to go back and watch that video because even though we're up this morning, what did change was the gamma wall came down from 4,750 to 4,700."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","387000","395000"," So what I'm going to do at the open today is if we touch up there at that 4,700, I need to close my calls."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","395000","407000"," And now the wall is there, whether you believe it or not, buyers could step in this morning to push this market up into today and into the weekend at least for a rally."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","407000","411000"," But there are some real mechanics that took place last night."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","411000","413000"," I need all of you to understand this morning."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","413000","415000"," I need you guys to pay attention to this."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","416000","420000"," There last night or yesterday between 1 o'clock and 4pm."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","420000","430000"," If you are a call holder or a stock holder in speculative growth stocks that are up right now, the banks really, truly did come in."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","430000","432000"," Now they might get squeezed today."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","432000","443000"," It might be a really good day for bulls, but I have to warn you that between now and the Tuesday and Wednesday, the environment for some stocks out there is going to get very dangerous and wild."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","443000","446000"," It blows accounts up. Some accounts are going to make lots of money."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","446000","459000"," Have where you want to buy in and where you want to take profit and maybe wait until the FOMC to rebuy in."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","459000","466000"," Now let's just say one of these speculative stocks gets the hedge put on it and it starts to trade down into Tuesday."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","467000","470000"," And you believe truly that we're not going to taper."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","470000","483000"," Wait for that moment to buy in because what happens is if you put a hedge that heavy on a stock as you head into an event where no one knows what's going to take place."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","483000","488000"," If they don't taper, those stocks will, that will, that's what they'll do."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","488000","491000"," They will skyrocket to the moon."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","491000","496000"," Now let's just say that the taper does come into effect or they do start to begin to taper."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","496000","500000"," Those stocks are going to drop like rocks as well."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","500000","502000"," And there might even be a moment."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","502000","506000"," I was talking about this last week with, or this earlier this week with Tesla."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","506000","520000"," When those hedge walls are kept on a stock that close to the price of the stock and the liquidity comes up to move the market up, these hedge funds and banks will momentarily dump that stock."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","521000","530000"," So even in that moment on Tuesday and Wednesday and FOMC and you're like, hey, I want to buy into let's say a Tesla that the banks put a hedge on."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","530000","538000"," You want to look for that one brief moment where they dump it to get out of their short positions to take it for a ride back up."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","538000","545000"," Now some of you asked me last week why Tesla would be going down while the hedge was coming off."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","545000","551000"," And that's because I might own, if I'm a bank, I'm going to own tons of that stock already."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","551000","555000"," Millions of shares of that stock while I am actively shorting."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","555000","568000"," And what I can do is block trade in low liquidity environments like pre-market to quickly dump the price of that stock, close my shorts, and then also buy back that stock that I sold."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","568000","583000"," There are methods for these banks to hold stock short, make money on the short side, and then get out of a bad trade like they had done on, I think it was Monday morning when I had made that big rant post where I started coming back into the comment section"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","583000","586000"," and I had to make a short two minute video."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","586000","594000"," You guys are starting to learn with me how to buy closes, how to plan to buy closes, what to look for when to buy closes."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","595000","604000"," Now my plan yesterday that I had to buy that close, after a close yesterday, some real negative news came out saying that I was kind of screwed this morning."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","604000","612000"," And for all intents and purposes that could have been screwed, but this shows how you make a plan for what you're going to do at certain price levels."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","612000","617000"," It shows when you take profit, it shows when you're the guy in the bottom and not at the top, right?"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","617000","624000"," You're not the FOMO buyer at the top, you're the guy that's buying these bottoms so that you can sell to the FOMO buyers in regular hours."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","624000","626000"," You guys catching all this stuff?"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","626000","628000"," Let me not taper, sorry, my bad."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","628000","630000"," I keep saying taper, I mean raising rates."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","630000","631000"," Thanks for the correction."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","631000","633000"," Greg, I appreciate the correction."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","633000","636000"," I'm not talking about taper, I'm talking about raising rates."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","636000","641000"," Thank you guys for saying it for mentioning that."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","641000","643000"," Let's go through here."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","643000","646000"," Spy, Rip and Hard, good morning, Austria, Europe."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","646000","648000"," Yeah, Christopher, how are you, Christoph?"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","648000","649000"," What's up?"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","649000","653000"," Hi, Magnus, good morning."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","653000","656000"," Is Tesla a speculative growth stock?"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","656000","657000"," Yes, it is."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","657000","661000"," So I want you guys to realize whether you believe it or not, I'm going to post something for you today."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","661000","669000"," The hedge funds put heavy hedges on Tesla, GME, and AMC, and more than likely more stocks."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","670000","673000"," I'm going to do a video today about this stuff for you guys."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","673000","675000"," I don't want you guys to share this video."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","675000","677000"," I'm going to keep it private for just you guys."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","677000","679000"," I love Tesla, I'm a Tesla bull."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","679000","683000"," I kept saying Tesla to you at our taper this morning."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","683000","685000"," I mean rates, okay?"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","685000","688000"," So I'm going to let you guys go here in the next couple minutes."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","688000","691000"," I hope you guys are making money off the trades that I give you."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","691000","697000"," I hope you guys took the protection yesterday in the middle of the afternoon to protect your"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","697000","701000"," calls if you did stay long so that you didn't lose your shirts yesterday and I hope you guys"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","701000","705000"," were able to buy that clothes with me yesterday and they were able to take some profit this"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","705000","707000"," morning from buying that clothes."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","707000","709000"," I love you guys."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","709000","710000"," You guys are awesome."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","710000","712000"," I really do."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","712000","714000"," Why the $1?"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","714000","715000"," Well, widespread."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","715000","716000"," Okay, good question, Alex."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","716000","719000"," So I'm going to show you guys something this morning, okay?"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","719000","722000"," So this is where my buy zones start to come into play."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","722000","731000"," I have some videos on my YouTube channel where I talked to you guys how to not blow up your"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","731000","735000"," accounts and take on risk the proper way."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","735000","742000"," So when we're going to risk on type situation or risk off type situation, I start to enter"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","742000","747000"," trades more aggressive as time moves on because sometimes you're not buying the right dip."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","747000","749000"," Does that make sense?"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","749000","753000"," So this could have failed this morning and we could have come down to 4600."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","753000","757000"," So at 4600, I'm going to get as aggressive as I possibly can."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","757000","759000"," I'm going to go all in full bore."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","759000","764000"," I'm going to go in a little bit less up here, maybe less time, not so much spreads, but"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","764000","767000"," my first buy ins are typically spreads with time on them."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","767000","769000"," I do buy FDs all the time."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","769000","771000"," This time I did not."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","771000","773000"," There was no risk as we were making this move up."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","773000","778000"," We were in a vanity right here, but right here, as we're taking a dip down below,"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","778000","783000"," I take less risky buy ins as we start dipping below."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","783000","786000"," Sometimes these things fail right here."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","786000","787000"," You can't say that they don't."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","787000","789000"," You've hit a top up here."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","789000","791000"," You know that we can come back down to this 4600."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","791000","792000"," So you have to measure."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","792000","795000"," Well, first you have to plan when you're going to make that entry."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","795000","797000"," You have to measure how much risk you're going to put on."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","797000","800000"," And then you have an inside of that."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","800000","804000"," Let's say you have a 70% success rate."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","804000","809000"," It's due to those plans that you're making before those moves happen."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","809000","810000"," Does that make sense?"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","810000","815000"," When you hear about guys blowing up their accounts, it's because they don't measure their risk."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","815000","819000"," They don't put risk on appropriately when they should be bought."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","819000","826000"," You know, you guys will see memes out there that say I kept buying the dip and kept getting blown up, right?"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","826000","830000"," That's because you're not measuring the risk for where you actually are."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","830000","832000"," You guys got it?"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","833000","834000"," You aren't swearing today."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","834000","835000"," No swearing."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","835000","836000"," I made a lot of money this week."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","836000","837000"," Yes, I did."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","837000","841000"," I've done very well this week, but I hope you guys have done well as well."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","841000","847000"," Tell me you guys have done well this week because we've had some really great trades."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","847000","848000"," Really great trades."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","848000","850000"," Can you guys hear me out there?"
"aQCtxHV_FjA","850000","852000"," I hope you can."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","852000","854000"," Okay, you guys are getting ready to start."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","854000","855000"," You guys understand."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","855000","856000"," You guys are going to."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","856000","857000"," So here's the deal."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","857000","858000"," I'm trying."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","858000","860000"," I'm working on right now being able to live trade with you guys."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","861000","863000"," I have to try to hide my information."
"aQCtxHV_FjA","863000","866000"," I don't think you guys can hear me."
