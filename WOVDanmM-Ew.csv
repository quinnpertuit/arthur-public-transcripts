"520","1860"," All right, let's see if this works."
"22700","24020"," Yeah, what's going on?"
"24720","26520"," All right, tell me you can hear me right now."
"27040","27900"," Can you hear me?"
"28020","29140"," Please tell me you can hear me. "
"29980","30920"," Tell me the chat."
"31800","32560"," You hear me?"
"33340","34000"," Fuck yeah."
"36560","39860"," Can you hear a Yellen speaking in the background?"
"45940","47880"," Can you hear Yellen talking in the background?"
"51340","52200"," You can't hear. "
"52320","52940"," I didn't think you could."
"53160","57720"," So I'm still having some some issues with audio and I agree with you."
"59640","61280"," I agree with you on the. "
"63739","66480"," Let's take a look real quick and see if we can figure it out."
"70290","71150"," You don't."
"72750","73810"," Second, we announced. "
"73970","74710"," Oh, wait a minute."
"74770","75470"," Can you hear it now?"
"75910","77550"," To provide additional liquidity."
"78190","79630"," Yeah, you can hear it now, can't you?"
"80790","81870"," I think you can hear it now. "
"81970","82450"," Can you hear me on?"
"82690","84350"," Can you says can't hear?"
"84570","85290"," I can't hear Yellen."
"85530","85570"," Okay."
"88210","89090"," Yeah, you can hear. "
"89470","89910"," All right, cool."
"90770","93730"," Like you don't stream for one day and streamlabs is like."
"95390","96830"," Pulling a hissy fit in the background. "
"98830","99590"," It's like now."
"99730","100050"," Fuck you."
"100210","103670"," Did I swear in the first five minutes of the broadcast?"
"105570","109230"," You can hear Yellen now. "
"109430","109750"," Good."
"110110","117070"," I do have some stuff I got to do in the background because."
"117070","124810"," Letting banks, including the very largest and some regional banks, announced 30 billion dollars. "
"124810","125650"," She's so terrible."
"125850","129050"," The posits into first Republic Bank last week."
"130290","134070"," The support represents a vote of confidence in the banking system. "
"135830","139170"," We're continuing to monitor conditions closely."
"140130","141210"," How's everybody doing this morning?"
"141370","142730"," First off, just a couple of things."
"143730","146550"," I'll do the work in the background in just a second here, just so you can see. "
"148990","153410"," You're going to expect natural sellers to come into the market right where we are right now."
"154450","155910"," I'll show it to you on a."
"159230","160030"," Second here."
"160230","167330"," You can't believe. "
"167790","170670"," Back then my ass."
"172730","175030"," You did their holdings of subprime assets."
"175890","179750"," We do not see that situation in the banking system today. "
"180590","182410"," I'm just saying I get some stuff to do here with you."
"182790","186730"," So just let's look at Apple real quick."
"188210","191650"," This is in large part through the post crisis. "
"191970","193770"," You can see where Apple is right here."
"193870","199170"," You're going to see natural just just so you can see here, here, here, and then right here you"
"199170","202150"," should see some sort of natural resistance coming into the market."
"202730","209190"," But I wouldn't be fully bearish here at this point on the market or on Apple. "
"209510","215250"," And I'll head over to another just so you can see it here somewhere else."
"219190","221790"," So here is the daily trigger, OK?"
"223790","225970"," And there's two things you should be looking for here."
"226590","230290"," Just on this yellow line, this is the daily trend, right?"
"231270","234310"," Bulls want to hold on to this trend on Apple. "
"234590","235470"," This is Spy."
"236470","243990"," That's 396.73. Even with that said, we're a large, a large trigger cluster here."
"244270","246230"," And then we also have the hourly working its way higher. "
"246810","249370"," So on the down side, 39356."
"250630","255970"," Even with that said, it's not going to surprise me at all to see."
"256910","259350"," Large banks playing an important role in our environment. "
"261010","268110"," Even if we have a pullback here and some consolidation as this works itself out, we may not get"
"268110","269150"," that bloodbath down."
"269450","272430"," Could just be consolidation for a move even higher."
"273770","280630"," So you want to be probably watching the Spy in the background at least on this cluster and then"
"280630","282090"," maybe even a squeeze higher. "
"282330","283050"," You can actually see."
"284450","285810"," You go back to the main live stream."
"286570","290190"," So you can even see here where we've had other moments where we've squeezed higher. "
"290610","291470"," You can see it right here."
"291670","292830"," Bams squeeze higher."
"293590","297570"," So I'm going to expect that same kind of a thing to take place here at minimum. "
"298350","303810"," Something like this on Apple and Spy and some other tickers."
"303970","305390"," We'll take a look at that later this morning."
"305510","309670"," We're just waiting to see that to start off this morning because we've got a few things in the"
"309670","310790"," background I have to do. "
"313050","320450"," You also worked with us to deliver advanced payments from the Enhanced Child Tax Credit which"
"320450","324690"," helped cut child poverty nearly in half in 2021."
"326150","333830"," And we've collaborated to rapidly deploy assistance to hundreds of thousands of homeowners facing"
"333830","334630"," foreclosure."
"335970","337810"," And this is a five minute chart here. "
"337970","342190"," So I just wanted to see as long as we trade above this one minute line here, this white line,"
"342190","344010"," we'll still go up."
"344390","349270"," Even if there's natural selling that takes place in here, you should see this around the market."
"350670","352810"," Apple is a prime example of why that is. "
"353510","354570"," Does that mean you buy in here?"
"354770","355730"," I don't know, probably not."
"355950","360490"," I was just a phone with Joe Donut and I'm like, I'm selling to close a bunch of puts that"
"360490","363630"," I sold and I still have a bunch of puts out there."
"364630","369470"," So I'm working with mission oriented banks to put us on a path. "
"369510","370210"," Let me just one second."
"370370","371970"," I got something in the background I got to do."
"374030","375270"," And I'll get through it. "
"375370","377270"," I'll get through and see what you guys are commenting."
"378210","387110"," Has invested almost $3.4 billion in depository institutions through CDFIs."
"387630","389110"," I'm going to delete a couple of these things. "
"389110","390650"," Delete forever."
"392050","393750"," Yes, I understand the lead forever."
"394210","400830"," And competitiveness of our vibrant community and regional banking institutions. "
"401430","401950"," Vibrant."
"402290","403790"," So to end."
"404630","405710"," Total disaster. "
"406250","406970"," Where I started."
"408390","410110"," A safe and sound banking system."
"410110","411410"," Absolute total disaster. "
"411790","413110"," To the health of the American."
"413150","414310"," I was looking at the balance sheet."
"414550","416350"," I was talking to Joe's morning with a bound sheet. "
"416350","418270"," I was focused on doing our job."
"419250","420990"," Nice little cross over there."
"421130","422330"," We will remain vigilant. "
"423750","424550"," I look forward to."
"424730","428270"," Talking to Joe this morning about the bound sheet and you're talking about all of this work."
"428510","430350"," And our nation's economy. "
"430630","431890"," All of this work that we've done."
"438080","438900"," Copy that."
"439300","439340"," Close. "
"440820","443420"," All of this work we've been a done has been erased, right?"
"443640","444200"," All of the work."
"444400","444780"," Thank you."
"445100","445900"," Timelines erased. "
"446420","448900"," During this time of stress and for taking time."
"448900","451840"," Not only to deliver those important remarks, but to."
"452220","453580"," One more thing. "
"454680","455240"," Start."
"456280","458460"," I think an obvious one and that's kind of the."
"459660","461260"," Spoken about the extraordinary. "
"461860","462420"," Customization."
"462920","463720"," Anyone can know."
"463860","465320"," It's only subscribers can comment. "
"465960","467020"," Any duration."
"467020","468800"," Or have spoken about this."
"468980","469220"," Save. "
"469440","475180"," Making sure we have to understand the root causes of the factors before determining whether further"
"475180","478740"," regulatory or policy action needs to be taken."
"478740","485720"," Can you expand on that and kind of give us an idea of what you and your fellow regulators are"
"485720","486140"," considering?"
"486860","488380"," You know, where do we go from here?"
"489020","489660"," Okay."
"490480","491560"," Very good question. "
"491560","494740"," So let me just start by saying that."
"495280","497600"," Our banking system is sound."
"498500","500860"," Even as it's come under some pressure. "
"500860","503880"," As I indicated, this is just 2008."
"505880","508260"," 2008 was a solvency crisis."
"509060","510080"," Rather what we're. "
"510080","510920"," Yeah, smelling yelling."
"511140","512700"," I'm like, I can't."
"513559","514919"," Can't listen to this sometimes. "
"515480","517100"," And I'm a bullet."
"517100","518520"," I'm like, I can't listen to this."
"518679","519299"," I just can't. "
"519299","523940"," We committed to taking actions that will mitigate financial stability."
"524500","524720"," All right."
"524780","526340"," Let's see what you guys are saying in the multi stream here. "
"526420","527680"," Let's see if we get youtubers on here."
"527680","530400"," Every step we've taken has been."
"530580","531780"," I don't see any YouTube. "
"531780","533220"," Oh, maybe I do have youtubers there."
"534420","534900"," Awesome."
"535080","536560"," I can see YouTube comments right now. "
"536700","538600"," And we stand behind."
"539300","541100"," Up chat live chat."
"541420","542820"," The public should have. "
"543000","543380"," All right."
"543500","544280"," Good morning, everybody."
"544780","546360"," More in days on more in Doug. "
"546920","549120"," I was having some technical issues coming back on this morning."
"549540","550480"," Live with you."
"550880","552500"," Something when I don't stream for a day. "
"552840","555800"," Sometimes stream labs like the update in the background."
"556720","559700"," Made my main display is all kind of wonky."
"561620","565320"," We've got 120,000 puts on 397 P for today. "
"565480","567660"," Well, I thought it was 21st."
"567760","568380"," So on a second here."
"568420","568920"," Yes, today. "
"569380","569860"," Good."
"570100","570900"," Oh, my God."
"571080","571800"," Hey, guess what else?"
"571980","572240"," Of course. "
"572880","574000"," Yeah, that's a special announcement."
"574400","575180"," I didn't even realize it."
"575220","577680"," When they face the positive outflows. "
"578060","579640"," Everyone's been quiet around my house."
"579900","585880"," That's the reason that was the motivation for the founding of the Fed in 2013."
"586040","587680"," I'm going to read through some of your comments. "
"588540","589660"," Good morning, everybody."
"591060","593540"," I'm able to provide the futures."
"594020","594040"," Today. "
"594360","598460"," It looks like a new hug on the market by a MEMS. Good morning, everybody."
"598560","598960"," Good morning, John. "
"599100","600540"," Biggest morning for Nando."
"601220","601640"," Morning."
"601900","604020"," 12 morning youngness. "
"605280","605880"," Tesla baby."
"606900","608420"," We'll get Tesla this morning as well."
"609160","610300"," Let me look at a switch. "
"611280","612460"," Try to catch up with everybody."
"613140","615920"," I have a multi stream chat."
"616280","618260"," And in touch with you. "
"618720","620940"," But it's trying to catch up right now."
"621160","622580"," Thanks in this room."
"623660","626080"," Miss scroll through as you guys are all talking about here. "
"626860","628220"," All right, so we got everybody here."
"628360","630040"," Flows have stabilized."
"630640","632500"," That's really what we're focused on. "
"632560","632640"," Good."
"632860","635460"," You asked me to look forward."
"636580","638680"," Private, put, put, put, put, put, put, put. "
"638800","639460"," Having a baby?"
"641520","642320"," Well, you know what?"
"642440","647600"," Something is funny that happened yesterday is to have a doctor's appointment yesterday for my"
"647600","647860"," throat."
"648100","649460"," I have to go up to you to see a throat specialist."
"651200","655400"," Whatever that means, maybe I probably have to take a loop down the throat or something. "
"656340","663200"," But then my, my daughter fell off a boat yesterday and smashed her ankle."
"663200","665200"," It was like a baseball size."
"666660","669100"," It was like a baseball on the side of her leg. "
"669600","671460"," She took her to the emergency room yesterday."
"672300","674280"," And I'm like, this is, this is a weird day."
"674960","676860"," So I think there will be time. "
"677040","677960"," It will be necessary."
"678880","680180"," But there's time to."
"680340","680980"," Oh, Fernando. "
"681240","681860"," No worries, brother."
"682040","683020"," Some adjustments."
"683480","684820"," Were you inside of the?"
"685500","686160"," Were you in?"
"686360","688020"," Did you happen to be inside of the discord yesterday?"
"688440","690520"," Your wife's boyfriend on a live stream. "
"691480","693140"," Yesterday for us as a felon."
"694320","697400"," And I heard great things that went over very, very well."
"698800","703740"," Stabilizing our system and restoring the confidence of the positives. "
"704540","708060"," But it has been announced that vice chair for super."
"708180","708920"," Hope she feels better."
"709060","709760"," No, thanks. "
"709880","715520"," We'll undertake a thorough review of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank."
"716220","716920"," Yeah, it didn't help."
"717000","718020"," It didn't help this time. "
"718020","722580"," The throat is not doing well."
"722960","728580"," I need to bring on someone I can speak with on a regular."
"730020","731660"," Not quite like Jamie. "
"732860","736160"," But hey, Jamie, someone I can speak back and forth with."
"736380","738640"," I'm not constantly talking all the time."
"739260","740520"," Second question I have for you. "
"741120","746660"," And I also did some work on humidifier."
"747420","751620"," So I've got a heating cooling system that removes an ad humidity."
"752420","758040"," I'm paying a lot of humidity out of my house, but I have to add extra for my throat. "
"758420","763660"," And then I have a friend who does a lot of audio work that's given me some suggestions."
"764860","766060"," Now that stuff has worked for me."
"766340","769840"," So we don't want to lose my voice, right?"
"770420","775320"," So what happens is I stream and then when I get done, my throat seizes up. "
"775320","778280"," And then I can't speak with my wife and my children."
"778800","784320"," And then this past weekend, it was three days of not speaking to my family."
"784620","786820"," I can't have that either, right?"
"786900","790960"," Gotta have the voice at least to carry a conversation. "
"795180","796400"," She's doing well."
"796680","799440"," I'm surprised because we took her to the yard yesterday."
"800680","807760"," And well, the non-funny part of that story is I had told her that I would go out and"
"807760","808860"," work with her. "
"809440","817980"," And then I was working on a server inside of the house that the family shares for Plex."
"818700","821200"," And she didn't grab me to come with her outside."
"822740","824680"," She just went outside and started working. "
"825980","827720"," And just outside the boat."
"828200","830120"," And I wasn't there."
"831640","833820"," And I remember when I was a kid. "
"835040","835680"," I had a..."
"837400","839640"," I had been outside cleaning a pool in my house."
"839960","841320"," I fell in the pool in the middle of winter."
"842780","844920"," And I had to drag myself out of the pool. "
"845120","845420"," It was freezing."
"845760","846280"," It was really bad."
"847080","847560"," Nobody was there. "
"847680","848340"," It was just myself alone."
"848840","850720"," And so all these things, you do that dangerous in life."
"851800","853140"," You always have somebody there when you can. "
"856680","859700"," I try to get you guys a Discord link this morning."
"859980","861480"," I'll grab you guys a Discord link."
"861560","863320"," We assure their customers. "
"863940","864780"," I don't know if it's recorded."
"865000","866400"," Normally as we record it on their end."
"867260","869020"," I don't know if the Discord can record. "
"870020","871620"," Maybe on your end if you're listening."
"872920","874600"," Or the person that's presenting."
"876420","878820"," But I was already asked that this morning wasn't recorded. "
"880620","882000"," Pre-streamers on the phone."
"883520","884480"," That's the case."
"885500","887260"," Protect out maybe just stream in the morning. "
"887260","888820"," It's not much happening during lunch time shots."
"890560","891840"," I'll say to control the yelling."
"892620","894060"," I got some recalls right here. "
"894140","895240"," Get some over here."
"896360","900160"," And to demonstrate that we are..."
"900160","902020"," You've got to think of my throw-out-of-work spiracles."
"902440","902980"," It's a late one I know. "
"903560","904840"," So two-ball compound."
"904840","909280"," The banking system in their deposits."
"909580","911100"," You're saying there is a..."
"911100","912260"," Secretary on it in fact. "
"912480","914320"," There is a..."
"914320","915940"," Before you arrive talking about this."
"915940","916340"," But records."
"917280","918460"," I shouldn't say that either. "
"918780","920080"," Discord's got everything these days."
"920380","924560"," In the house we're exactly the themes that we use to kick off this conference."
"924800","925900"," We're aligned certainly on that. "
"926460","928540"," I know your time is tight and you have a thousand places to go."
"928740","931760"," But as a treasury vet myself I have to ask you about..."
"931760","934500"," Ignore the big green and red balls."
"935840","937060"," Before the stress. "
"937620","938780"," I think it has to do with..."
"938780","941320"," Several days we were looking at the need to raise..."
"941320","945640"," The amount of talking to the constant constant constant."
"946200","948480"," It's like seven hours a day and then the last..."
"948480","951620"," I think it might have been the last Sunday stream was the last..."
"951620","953320"," We're not having the two days rest."
"953520","957040"," In the events of the last eleven days how important is it for..."
"957040","957400"," Uh oh. "
"957600","959240"," We're losing stuff in the background here."
"959240","964300"," That ceiling standoff acknowledging that people are talking about current events and act swiftly to"
"964300","966600"," ensure the full faith and credit of the United States."
"966640","968320"," Yeah, clock out monologue lies wise. "
"968620","969700"," If it becomes..."
"969700","971480"," That's what I think is..."
"972080","975660"," Set a timer and then take breaks throughout the day."
"976300","978500"," Might be part of the solution as well."
"979680","983860"," We have the amount of time. "
"983940","988740"," The amount of time the constant target is like six, seven hours, five days a week and then you"
"988740","989240"," throw it on a Sunday."
"989660","990860"," It's like just too much."
"992480","995180"," The other side of this too is that I have another side of my life, right?"
"995400","998580"," You got kids and then it gets dogs and they got a wife. "
"999040","999660"," They got friends."
"1000820","1004480"," And that's the time that's happened in the history of..."
"1004480","1008640"," So just normal conversation has been a challenge."
"1009320","1014000"," With the debt limit I think really imposes substantial harm. "
"1014000","1018000"," It brings the cost of the United States of borrowing."
"1018980","1021080"," Yeah, I've got a sound meter."
"1021540","1025319"," I have a sound meter that I can see on my voice. "
"1025619","1026359"," I think it's the amount of time."
"1026460","1029740"," I think it's the amount of time that I'm actually talking."
"1030119","1033380"," We have the safest and..."
"1033380","1034339"," You always happen, dude. "
"1034880","1035079"," Too much."
"1035819","1038859"," Liquid financial system of any in the world."
"1039260","1041280"," The dollar serves as a reserve. "
"1041280","1045280"," So I was talking to Joe this morning and I said to him, I think we're both on the same"
"1045280","1046020"," page on this."
"1047660","1049540"," And it was so bizarre."
"1050020","1052160"," We wipe out..."
"1052160","1055460"," You figure we have a timeline for recovery, right?"
"1055700","1060580"," The market plays ball with Jerome Powell and his plan and pass. "
"1062300","1069000"," I think the baseline here, when you separate all the gray and the noise and the nuts and bolts and"
"1069000","1071000"," all that other stuff, you're just like looking at the hammer."
"1072500","1073800"," And the fed is a hammer."
"1076280","1078060"," So the fed is a..."
"1078400","1083460"," There's two sides that argue about the fed where people will say, well, the fed is a hammer because"
"1083460","1087460"," they don't over-complicate things. "
"1088500","1090840"," They break things too when they're using this hammer."
"1091360","1097920"," The same is in the reverse as well for the fed, or normally is in the reverse for the fed"
"1097920","1098240"," as well."
"1098240","1104200"," But there's a contract or an agreement with society. "
"1106180","1108120"," And the con..."
"1108120","1108760"," At large."
"1109340","1111220"," And this is Bob on Main Street."
"1111580","1112460"," This is the stock market. "
"1112600","1113360"," This is the bond market."
"1114120","1114540"," She's the bank."
"1114860","1115400"," These are the companies. "
"1115880","1116460"," These are the CEOs."
"1116960","1117280"," This is everybody."
"1119100","1124800"," And the fed is contractually making agreements with everybody. "
"1124800","1130260"," And 2022, the market rolls over."
"1130480","1136180"," We trade sideways once we realize, quote unquote, realize that the fed is really doing its job."
"1136360","1137540"," We're taking the fed seriously. "
"1138980","1140840"," You actually see the market go up."
"1141360","1143960"," Our sideways end up, right?"
"1144240","1145280"," Sideways end up for the fed."
"1145900","1151440"," And these past two, three weeks here, that agreement's been broken. "
"1154540","1158760"," And that agreement being broken, you can see it in the balance sheet."
"1159000","1164500"," This is like getting rid of the bullshit, the noise, all the shit out there."
"1164820","1173900"," The argument, the fighting on Twitter, the news stories, talking about all of this nonsense. "
"1175460","1179360"," The fact is that the balance sheet was erased."
"1180000","1183800"," So all this work that we've done in this balance sheet has been erased."
"1184800","1186040"," And you have companies. "
"1186420","1186920"," You have people."
"1187140","1188560"," You have the stock market."
"1189200","1191040"," You have all these different entities. "
"1192500","1194320"," Well, they're on a kind of a timeline."
"1195020","1196080"," We always talk about it on the show."
"1196940","1197780"," The timing isn't right. "
"1197940","1198820"," The timing is right."
"1199100","1202200"," The market looks like this versus the timing is right or wrong."
"1203560","1205340"," It's not unexpected. "
"1209140","1212080"," It's almost like they threw a wrench intentionally, right?"
"1212840","1221020"," But the fact is that all of this work, it's where we talk sometimes in the program about how the"
"1221020","1227860"," fed is applying tools when it may have missed time applying those tools."
"1229940","1232060"," All that money that sloshes around, right?"
"1232220","1234380"," All the money is sloshing around in the market."
"1234380","1235980"," But sloshing around everywhere, right?"
"1236080","1236740"," Sloshing around in homes. "
"1237200","1243720"," We talk about Mary, the landscaper and how she probably has more time before she's going to take a"
"1243720","1243880"," hit."
"1244740","1252780"," And yet we're on this course as if Mary didn't have new lawn mowers and a new truck and a"
"1252780","1253800"," new trailer."
"1255000","1260500"," People didn't want to go back to work or go back to normal life after COVID. "
"1261320","1261880"," People do."
"1262040","1263040"," They want to go back to normal life."
"1263180","1263840"," They want to go back to work. "
"1264760","1266200"," They have a bunch of new shit."
"1266420","1267800"," They took care of all of their debt and their bills."
"1268100","1273600"," Even though you're hearing noise out there saying that it's the worst credit card debt that's ever"
"1273600","1276060"," been, worst of this, worst of that, all that stuff. "
"1276560","1278940"," So none of this stuff is matching up to normal cycles."
"1279520","1280120"," None of it is."
"1280620","1282700"," None of it is like a normal cycle that you'd expect. "
"1285000","1290960"," And so you see all this work has been destroyed in the background."
"1291280","1298920"," And you see the Fed put to an extent stepping in to support regional banks."
"1299600","1304320"," And on one side telling you, you've got Yellen right here telling you if there's nothing wrong. "
"1305400","1309060"," They're holding meetings, they're having press releases on Sundays."
"1310400","1312380"," You know that there is infection."
"1312380","1313680"," You know there's contagion. "
"1314700","1322320"," I'm assuming that you know there's infection and scaring investment out there."
"1323240","1326640"," You see it in UBS in Credit Suisse."
"1329950","1333030"," And there's a parachute that's been released. "
"1333490","1335370"," It's almost as if."
"1338250","1342770"," Rather than not seeing what was going to take place in 2000 or 2008."
"1343330","1344950"," They've seen it in advance. "
"1347010","1350950"," And so they've seen it in advance and they're deploying this golden parachute."
"1351250","1351850"," I was talking to Joe."
"1351850","1354970"," I was like, I was like this back stopping right now. "
"1357870","1360210"," It's within you remember that we got the hammer, right?"
"1360370","1360770"," That's the Fed."
"1361770","1364150"," And it's kind of it's a tough pill to swallow."
"1365050","1367810"," To be told, we're going to protect banks. "
"1370780","1372760"," We're going to pre protect banks."
"1373360","1374800"," Before we get there, right?"
"1375820","1378980"," We're going to pre protect banks, but then we're going to fuck everybody else."
"1379920","1382020"," And we want you to agree to this new change. "
"1384800","1389420"," And it's not like 2008, 2000 where everybody's getting fucked banks again."
"1389600","1395580"," And then later on they ended up."
"1395580","1396780"," Like we need to restart the economy. "
"1398140","1403080"," And you need to start lending to the economy again, lending to Bob on Main Street and Mary on Main"
"1403080","1403340"," Street."
"1403480","1404320"," What they didn't do that, right?"
"1406400","1408100"," They needed those bonds to be backstop."
"1408300","1410880"," And they bought those bonds knowing that they would backstop. "
"1411100","1414600"," And you're almost seeing like a, like I'm not quite a reverse."
"1415720","1418520"," But before the bad shit comes, we're going to take care of the banks."
"1419560","1420140"," We even get there. "
"1420280","1422120"," We're still going to fuck Main Street."
"1423860","1426360"," And that's a hard contract to swallow."
"1426980","1430380"," I was thinking about, I think that the Fed does 25 BPS. "
"1431120","1437940"," I would be angry if I was Main Street, USA."
"1439200","1441500"," I would be angry if I was Main Street, USA."
"1441640","1442760"," And that was the decision. "
"1444660","1448480"," Because you're talking about if you're going to do a bailout of some kind."
"1448840","1450100"," We can name it whatever we want."
"1450100","1451960"," We can say it's not backstop, it's not a bailout. "
"1452560","1455080"," It's not whatever we're saying it is."
"1456600","1458600"," Inevitably, it is to some extent, right?"
"1460060","1464120"," And it's almost like if you're going to do that, then you might, if you're going to ruin all this"
"1464120","1469580"," work that's been done on the balance sheet, you might as well just start sending checks to every"
"1469580","1471380"," American at the same time that you're doing it."
"1472360","1473740"," I know that's crazy to say. "
"1474080","1475260"," I don't want to see that happen."
"1476020","1476720"," But it is."
"1477080","1478380"," That is what's going on. "
"1479120","1483220"," So when you're telling everyone out there, hey, look, we're going to tighten until you break"
"1483220","1483500"," something."
"1484920","1485640"," No problem."
"1485940","1488520"," You're probably breaking people out there, right?"
"1488640","1490740"," They're paying like eight bucks for eggs and also the nonsense. "
"1491560","1495980"," You've got a high rates of interest rates on mortgage loans."
"1496440","1498600"," Any kind of variable rate is through the fucking roof."
"1499220","1502700"," And at the same time, you're saying, but we're going to support this guy over here, but not you. "
"1504080","1507620"," And I got to tell you, even as a bull, I want to see a bottom of this market."
"1507840","1509520"," As a bull, I want to see things break."
"1511440","1516200"," These people in these regional banks, they took more risk than they should have. "
"1516420","1519760"," And they should get burned on this torch to the ground."
"1519940","1521580"," Whatever comes out of that comes out of that."
"1522280","1526000"," You don't want to just break Mary on Main Street. "
"1526160","1527380"," You want to break Mary on Main Street."
"1527900","1530420"," Whoever had bad dad or has bad dad, you should break them."
"1530420","1534220"," For the same time, you've got a rot. "
"1535000","1542020"," You got, you know, we know that there are zombie mid-sized and small-sized zombie companies out"
"1542020","1542300"," there."
"1542540","1545400"," We know that there are zombie large companies out there."
"1545860","1547440"," Well, that didn't do the right thing. "
"1548100","1550400"," And you saw outsized risk."
"1550780","1555700"," You saw a goading of the fed to raise interest rates while they're buying bonds."
"1556040","1557140"," Some of these banks are buying bonds. "
"1558520","1559980"," At the absolute worst time."
"1560300","1561300"," You make these kind of mistakes."
"1563960","1565320"," You pay for it. "
"1566740","1569060"," Mary on Main Street is going to pay for this."
"1570220","1570620"," Right?"
"1570920","1575040"," So, Mary on Main Street's not Mary, but, you know, people that took on bad dad or didn't take care"
"1575040","1575400"," of themselves."
"1576920","1581060"," During COVID, you know, maybe they got free money of any kind. "
"1581480","1586360"," And instead of, I don't know, taking care of their second or third mortgage, they went party or"
"1586360","1591200"," something or they went off and ski all, all COVID or whatever they was that they did."
"1592160","1594580"," Those people need to get taken out of the system."
"1596340","1598140"," And that's going to happen. "
"1598700","1606120"," And that right now is kind of what it leads into is, you're still now breaking certain people, but"
"1606120","1612160"," pre-parachuting, pre-parachuting people that shouldn't be parachuted."
"1612900","1614480"," I'm not at this stage in the game."
"1614760","1617220"," Think of this as like a football game. "
"1617820","1619320"," We're not even in the fourth quarter yet."
"1619520","1621540"," We're in like the second quarter of this football game."
"1622380","1628600"," And you're saying, okay, team number two, or team number one, you have to, you have five heard"
"1628600","1631240"," players and you have to use your bench. "
"1632280","1637500"," And what's left in your bench, but team number two, they have five heard players too."
"1637620","1642040"," We're going to let them bring on some all stars from other teams to fill in."
"1642040","1645820"," And I don't know that I agree with that. "
"1651440","1651920"," Thanks."
"1652220","1653360"," Good to see you guys."
"1653580","1654000"," So, I'll see you. "
"1657520","1658320"," Cargilloput of Guinness."
"1664530","1665230"," They should."
"1666230","1668270"," You know, I think we get 25 BPS. "
"1668610","1674150"," I don't know how that contract goes over for regular Americans."
"1674550","1678310"," I don't know how that contract goes over for regular Americans."
"1681210","1683110"," I'm disgusted by it right now. "
"1684250","1684770"," Absolutely."
"1685090","1691750"," And, you know, you've just basically said, we're going to drag this out even longer now."
"1693550","1695050"," That's basically what's being said. "
"1695390","1695730"," Fuck you."
"1695850","1696950"," We're dragging this out longer."
"1698810","1701350"," And by the way, you don't get a bailout. "
"1701850","1703850"," So does regular American get a bailout?"
"1705170","1707410"," Do they get regular checks a week like we did in COVID?"
"1707410","1708070"," Fuck no."
"1709070","1709930"," Fuck no."
"1711690","1713090"," Do they get a."
"1714290","1715810"," I don't know what to say here. "
"1716070","1717650"," My mind is blown."
"1718410","1720510"," And then we go back to the hammer of the Fed."
"1721270","1726010"," Let's say the Fed does raise 25 BPS attempts to. "
"1727230","1729350"," Balance and not be a hammer anymore."
"1729510","1731070"," Be more precision based."
"1731770","1731850"," Right?"
"1732150","1735730"," Okay, we're going to fight inflation and we're going to backstop all these banks. "
"1737110","1738810"," And these aren't even banks that are healthy."
"1739410","1740450"," These are banks that are unhealthy."
"1741030","1747470"," You're probably going to find out down the road that these healthy banks were as bad as these"
"1747470","1748250"," unhealthy banks. "
"1748430","1749730"," We just don't know it yet."
"1757730","1759250"," Yeah, I agree with the cars and trucks."
"1759550","1761590"," I agree 100% agree with the cars and trucks. "
"1762550","1766410"," I've watched some of those current truck guys videos over the weekend."
"1766730","1768110"," It's a disaster."
"1769130","1774970"," We talked about that prior to right $140,000 trucks $80,000 trucks just pure nonsense. "
"1782140","1782980"," Yeah, I don't know."
"1783180","1785260"," I think that Americans know I think they do."
"1787280","1788600"," I think they do. "
"1788720","1790640"," The whole thing is a fuck show."
"1791040","1794120"," This looks like this looks like oh wait, right?"
"1794420","1797820"," And 2000 now it didn't look as much as look like that."
"1798320","1800840"," But to me now it's looking like 2000 2008. "
"1800840","1806820"," And they're front running protecting themselves rather than, you know, got caught my pants down."
"1806920","1807820"," I'm going to protect myself."
"1808440","1809780"," And this might be the greatest. "
"1810100","1817900"," This could be the greatest fleecing of our country that I've ever witnessed as long as I've been"
"1817900","1818100"," alive."
"1818340","1819740"," This might be the greatest."
"1820040","1821820"," And I don't know that I've ever read anything. "
"1823400","1825660"," This is probably on par with."
"1829300","1833800"," Maybe with what Eisenhower said or possibly the fleecing of Social Security."
"1834480","1835640"," Something like that. "
"1837820","1840240"," Social security should have paid for itself, right?"
"1840840","1843540"," We know that that came for its own fund into the general fund."
"1844080","1847680"," This could be one of the great fleecings of our country by corporate America."
"1848880","1849860"," Not corporate America. "
"1850060","1851260"," I shouldn't say it by banks."
"1864480","1869920"," Yeah, no, I think I think I think you have to let some of these banks fail."
"1870260","1873340"," I think that I think that there's going to be damage done. "
"1873760","1878380"," But what I also think is that they know they're not telling you that if you let these banks fail,"
"1878380","1881800"," that these other larger banks are going to fail right along with them."
"1883100","1885380"," And so they're lying to us right now publicly."
"1886160","1890240"," You got yelling right now telling you there's no systemic risk. "
"1890240","1891960"," We all know that more than likely is."
"1891960","1893540"," And so I'm fine with that."
"1893720","1900340"," My point here is if you're going to I'm fine with backstopping banks, but then you backstop the"
"1900340","1901140"," rest of it as well. "
"1901680","1904540"," It should be zero BPS if anything rate cuts."
"1907000","1914060"," The idea that you're going to fuck over Mary on Main Street and not fuck over these other entities"
"1914060","1915020"," is a problem."
"1915180","1915900"," I got a problem with that. "
"1916440","1917540"," And if we have to live with."
"1917700","1924760"," And then that even leads into the conversation of if you're not going to support the banks, you're"
"1924760","1927500"," going to let them fail right alongside of Main Street."
"1928040","1929620"," I'm okay with that argument too. "
"1929960","1932220"," You can't have one or the other, right?"
"1932800","1933900"," You can't have just one."
"1934080","1937660"," You can, but if they're going to do that, it's pretty bad."
"1939340","1943220"," Because what they're telling you right now is you're going to live with inflation longer as being"
"1943220","1943820"," on Main Street. "
"1943820","1947940"," You're going to have more damage done to you for a longer period of time."
"1947940","1953660"," And meanwhile, we're going to save specific entities, i.e. banks only."
"1960640","1962520"," Yeah, I think that's the question, right?"
"1962820","1964560"," Because this leads to hyperinflation. "
"1966910","1969610"," Now this does this leads to hyperinflation one way or another."
"1970370","1972510"," Or at least extended inflation, right?"
"1972850","1976410"," Extended inflation for longer higher rates, more damage done."
"1977190","1981090"," Meanwhile, you've got some fat ass bank that's fine. "
"1983010","1983890"," As standard."
"1988580","1990520"," Yeah, and you kept getting sold out too."
"1990620","1992260"," You didn't get just get sold out in 2008. "
"1992740","1994520"," You got sold out down the road too."
"1996400","1999160"," So how much money they made, they're doing it."
"1999440","2000640"," They're pre-running it right now. "
"2000780","2003180"," It's being pre-run right in their face right now."
"2010570","2012050"," I think we're getting the real Volcker."
"2012190","2014430"," Well, we're getting a Volcker-esque moment right now. "
"2014430","2018710"," If you see 25 BPS, that's a Volcker moment."
"2019350","2028130"," But with a caveat that you're getting a certain class of the United States being backstop."
"2031980","2034600"," You're being told they can take as much risk as I want. "
"2034720","2035280"," It doesn't matter."
"2036340","2038320"," And I'll face zero consequences."
"2039620","2045780"," Where there were some financial consequences to banks in America in 2008. "
"2045780","2048139"," There wasn't criminal consequences."
"2048719","2049940"," They did make out like bandits."
"2050219","2053480"," But at the same time, a lot of bankers did get caught in that. "
"2054840","2056420"," And this time they're protecting that."
"2056739","2060500"," There's like this key undercurrent in the background."
"2061679","2062980"," Well, that's slightly different here. "
"2078159","2079480"," Yeah, it's a good thing."
"2080040","2081400"," Cody, I didn't see everything you said."
"2081560","2086000"," But under $250,000, I wanted to bring this up. "
"2086600","2092320"," Yesterday's stream, what I had planned to talk about was seeing some support coming in right now."
"2092380","2094100"," Some buyers still stepping into the market."
"2094940","2101320"," I wanted to talk about, there was a video that Andy Constant had put out this weekend about $250 "
"2101320","2104300",",000 depositors. "
"2104760","2108300"," And it was fascinating that he brought that up in that video."
"2108360","2109760"," And I wanted to discuss yesterday."
"2110580","2114820"," So I have owned, let me see here. "
"2114820","2116700"," How do I explain this twofold?"
"2117340","2118580"," I've owned different businesses."
"2119600","2129120"," One aspect of my life of businesses that I've owned have been very service"
"2129120","2138940"," in goods, costs, and insurance costs heavy with very low"
"2138940","2142740"," profit margins, but lots of money exchanging hands."
"2142740","2151900"," So if you out there know anyone that has a small, it's fascinating because I watch this, watch"
"2151900","2153840"," this, people are like, people wouldn't fit into it. "
"2154000","2162020"," They're on the news and they're like, and then you get regular people and regular people say things"
"2162020","2167300"," like, you shouldn't worry, it covers $250,000."
"2168000","2170120"," You don't have $250,000."
"2170120","2173420"," And most businesses don't have $250,000. "
"2173800","2174560"," You don't have to worry about it."
"2174980","2178820"," And who really has to worry about it is VCs."
"2179560","2181000"," And I'm like, this is not true. "
"2183040","2187820"," Any person out there can attest to this that owns a small size business?"
"2188360","2188760"," Not all."
"2189320","2195900"," I don't mean the services where you're providing, or I guess not real goods or services."
"2195900","2205620"," So if you own, let's say, I don't know, a mechanic shop, or if you own,"
"2205620","2206840"," let's say, a restaurant. "
"2208160","2209420"," Matter of fact, we'll use restaurants."
"2210680","2213300"," So restaurants are a fascinating thing to look at."
"2213400","2218340"," If you're like a small sized restaurant that does a million dollars a year, you more likely than"
"2218340","2220560"," likely make less than 10% profit in a year. "
"2221280","2226360"," But you pay high taxes, you pay multiple taxes to different entities, right?"
"2226500","2226940"," Normally, right?"
"2227120","2229380"," Then you pay high insurance costs."
"2229660","2233240"," This is for employees, the building, the business."
"2234220","2238120"," You pay for goods, and you pay for high employee costs, right?"
"2240080","2245660"," And more than likely you're running through at any time, let's say it's a million dollar business. "
"2246440","2250760"," You're more than likely, let's say you keep at best 6 to 10% of that."
"2252100","2255900"," You're probably spending spending out per month $80,000."
"2257100","2264540"," And most restaurants today probably doing more than that in a year, $1.5, $2 million a year. "
"2265120","2270580"," They meet more than likely to keep on hand in cash every month, $100,000 or $200,000."
"2271260","2272020"," Somewhere in there."
"2272880","2274120"," That's just free cash. "
"2275500","2276360"," To spend."
"2277460","2278660"," To pay out, right?"
"2279440","2284540"," You pay out the employees, you pay for your food, you pay for your liquor, wine, and beer."
"2285240","2288920"," You pay for your insurances, you've got money just coming on you. "
"2289000","2290420"," Basically, a custodian of money."
"2290920","2296500"," In most small businesses today, unless you're providing something that's like a real estate agent"
"2296500","2300340"," or something or, I don't know, you're a psychologist or something."
"2301680","2305100"," Where the only money you're putting out is to you, right?"
"2305620","2307560"," You're extending yourself to be making money. "
"2308500","2317940"," But if you're in a real business, you think $250,000 is in a bank for operating income is nothing."
"2319000","2325280"," And Andy made a great point about that this weekend about raising that FDIC insurance to at least a"
"2325280","2326300"," half a million dollars."
"2326300","2327500"," If not more. "
"2327900","2331620"," And this is just like, hey, I can't go and solve it this month."
"2332940","2338520"," So if you're a small business owner, we're not even talking medium sized business owners."
"2339580","2341620"," Just a small business owner. "
"2342440","2348840"," And you have any kind of high insurance, any kind of taxation that's on your, the goods and"
"2348840","2352040"," services you're selling day in, day out."
"2352040","2359040"," If you have a high number of employees, if you have the goods associated with all this, you got all"
"2359040","2361500"," these different things moving parts in your small business."
"2362660","2364220"," And it's intensive like that. "
"2364860","2369300"," You could think of a, there's like, you know, probably 70% of businesses out there like that."
"2370100","2372920"," These are the things that provide you a small."
"2373200","2377860"," That's not many mom podcast stations, but I would assume you're a small mom pop gas station. "
"2377860","2378660"," You have to buy fuel."
"2379240","2381260"," You have to buy the crackers that are on the shelf."
"2381460","2381880"," And the so does. "
"2382980","2385020"," And you pay those things off every month."
"2385480","2386960"," You probably have to pay tax taxes off."
"2387720","2389960"," Probably have employees running around that you're paying off. "
"2390580","2390660"," Right."
"2390960","2391720"," They're insurance too."
"2391980","2392720"," All these different things. "
"2393280","2397260"," So you have this, you're basically a custodian for other people's money."
"2398000","2400160"," And you're trusted as a small business owner."
"2400660","2403820"," Be that custodian of all this money coming and going within your business. "
"2404320","2405440"," So it's laughable."
"2406520","2410860"," It's laughable when they say, well, this doesn't impact most of you out there."
"2411360","2415560"," Most of you out there, you go to a job for 40 hours a week or 60 hours a week. "
"2415900","2418200"," You probably don't have $250,000 line around."
"2418600","2422480"," But the underlying machine of this country does."
"2423600","2425400"," And they most of them do. "
"2425680","2427820"," And $250,000 is not a lot of money."
"2428500","2432080"," Although it may seem like a lot to you if you have a regular job."
"2432080","2435020"," To any kind of small or medium-sized business owner. "
"2435200","2435980"," It's a ton of money."
"2436280","2437620"," And not only is it a ton of money."
"2438000","2440760"," In 08, people got paid their deposits back. "
"2441380","2442760"," Not before being held."
"2444640","2447940"," And even if it was for a short period of time, my point here is."
"2448400","2450100"," Even if it's for a short period of time. "
"2451720","2453420"," They need access to this money."
"2455280","2457280"," You can't be any excuse."
"2457960","2460020"," When a business owner says. "
"2461220","2462520"," I've committed my life to this."
"2462700","2466880"," I know there's like this argument out there that, you know, fuck business owners and fuck the man"
"2466880","2472380"," and fuck, you know, they're pointing fingers at some guy who owns a gas station, let's say, right?"
"2473380","2475240"," Fuck my landlord, something like that."
"2475300","2475800"," I get all that. "
"2476020","2481400"," But the truth is that a lot of these people have worked their balls off to be where they are."
"2482200","2488640"," And they're not going to get, they're not going to risk not having access to this money for that"
"2488640","2489380"," month or two."
"2490280","2494260"," So let's say they have 250 or half million dollars. "
"2494460","2498860"," They are going to move that money either into a prime bank, or believe it or not, into cash."
"2499900","2503160"," And always have that cash on hand, literal cash on hand."
"2503880","2506980"," So that there's no experience, no service disruption. "
"2507880","2510380"," Because there is no answer, excuse for people."
"2510900","2516060"," If you have an employee that works for you and they're working for you, let's say, and you're"
"2516060","2518780"," paying them 20 bucks an hour and they rely upon you."
"2518780","2520820"," To pay their rent off every month. "
"2521120","2523340"," They don't want to hear from you as the business owner."
"2523740","2529720"," Hey, sorry that the bank collapsed and I'm getting the money, but it's going to be a month from"
"2529720","2529960"," now."
"2530600","2533260"," Right, or I'm not going to check for you for two months. "
"2533420","2535000"," Oh, and by the way, we're going to shut everybody down."
"2535160","2541580"," It comes in here to eat or to buy a park or buy gasoline and all that kind of stuff."
"2542240","2546160"," So there is risk underneath the surface is the point. "
"2546660","2550320"," And you don't have to be a rocket scientist, especially a small business owner."
"2550740","2554880"," It doesn't have to be a rocket scientist to know that there's risk there."
"2555080","2560820"," Even if it's just the even if it's just a small blip of not being able to provide whatever they"
"2560820","2561940"," provide to the public. "
"2571270","2572610"," Yeah, it's a great time."
"2572750","2574410"," Andy made a very fair point about that."
"2574510","2578890"," And that's that needs to be done for all the rhetoric that's out there. "
"2580130","2584770"," All the rhetoric that's out there, that should be like number one, like should have been done,"
"2585210","2586430"," should have been done a week ago."
"2588310","2594750"," And that's that minimum, but even with that being said, people remember away people."
"2594870","2596050"," They don't like to talk about this. "
"2596350","2599830"," You get everybody got their money back up to that two hundred thousand and eight, but there were"
"2599830","2601950"," delays in getting that money."
"2602470","2606290"," So you know that there is not only money being moved prime banks, but there's money."
"2606490","2610570"," It's being pulled out of banks right now actively to have cash on hand. "
"2611450","2615870"," People have bills, people with small businesses pay an obscene amount of money."
"2616790","2623090"," Out of their banks, whether this is like it doesn't matter what it is."
"2623330","2628690"," If you're I don't want to touch this subject too much because it can make people upset. "
"2628690","2635870"," But the amount of money that comes out people pay is would would make a normal person."
"2636290","2636530"," Fuck."
"2646190","2647630"," Morning, Alexander, how are you?"
"2652680","2657800"," Yeah, Bill Ward saying small non bank mortgage companies does bizarre to because I even read a"
"2657800","2661740"," story this week and that said, you know, your local credit unions at no risk. "
"2662160","2663880"," And I'm like, this is bullshit too."
"2664680","2666780"," I'm like, this is absolute fucking bullshit."
"2668140","2669800"," He's making a good point here. "
"2670140","2671040"," Who said that point?"
"2671560","2677280"," Yeah, Bill Ward saying small non bank mortgage companies as example can be holding tens of millions"
"2677280","2678580"," that moves around constantly."
"2679040","2681880"," Yeah, they're like, there's no risk to credit unions."
"2681980","2683460"," I'm like, you fucking right there is. "
"2684240","2689340"," If you have a small business in a community that is they're like, they're like, they don't move"
"2689340","2691400"," around millions or a million and a half million dollars."
"2691400","2700200"," I'm like, I guarantee, I know for a fact firsthand that moving around or not moving money coming in"
"2700200","2706560"," and coming out every month, month to month can easily top hundreds of thousands of dollars."
"2707460","2708620"," That's just month to month. "
"2708760","2711680"," When I'm telling my course of a year, just month to month."
"2719950","2724830"," And so my point here though is you're probably seeing people doing this in the background."
"2725170","2726350"," They're not talking about this publicly. "
"2736520","2737480"," We just say it here."
"2742810","2743970"," Kind of waiting around here."
"2744010","2744550"," I'll bring up the. "
"2752690","2754770"," You know, you know, I'm talking about the debt ceiling."
"2758870","2763310"," Like it's in that, you know, of course you have all this going on and you still have political"
"2763310","2767030"," comments from China's president in a joint statement."
"2770230","2771290"," Talking about a."
"2771890","2773490"," Okay, it's a couple of things you got to look at here. "
"2781280","2787060"," All right, so if you guys want to know my positioning here is that I've closed some puts that I"
"2787060","2787440"," sold."
"2788260","2789660"," In the market right up here."
"2790340","2795100"," I'm still holding a bunch of puts into I've got some for into tomorrow. "
"2795740","2801580"," Part of a part of a ratio spread and then I've got some more puts that I have not sold"
"2801580","2804680"," for tomorrow as well just some crash protection."
"2805860","2810300"," I'm trying to catch that ball into the event tomorrow."
"2814650","2817390"," Move some of this stuff down here for you now. "
"2826170","2828010"," Two things you should be looking at here."
"2831500","2833460"," Consolidation taking place in the spy right now."
"2834580","2839120"," And I don't like seeing this little bit of a break off here from the hourly. "
"2839960","2842280"," Showing some weakness to the downside still."
"2844400","2852120"," So I'm going to expect to lease the rest of today for some kind of consolidation between 393 and"
"2852120","2852640"," 396."
"2853340","2855900"," So 30 points or so of consolidation. "
"2856900","2859100"," So we're going to chart this out for you right now."
"2859620","2862720"," I'm going to show you guys some numbers here 39345."
"2870510","2872130"," And draw these in real quick. "
"2878470","2879570"," Right in here."
"2879830","2882010"," This is going to be your hourly trend."
"2882010","2886170"," And we also have some other key numbers here. "
"2891930","2892530"," 3562."
"2893350","2894990"," I'm not necessarily bearish here."
"2905040","2906900"," If you wanted to get bearish here. "
"2907740","2909760"," It is below these two numbers here."
"2911140","2914820"," It's like any kind of selling off down here any kind of this nonsense down here."
"2915160","2917900"," Still considered consolidation down here. "
"2918420","2923200"," So I wouldn't take this bearish unless you start to start to break below and reject to go lower."
"2924220","2925320"," Outside of that."
"2925580","2931660"," This looks like more like normal natural seller stepping in normal natural resistance point in the"
"2931660","2931980"," market. "
"2932800","2938160"," And then looking for some kind of buyer buyers to step in down below here."
"2945880","2948440"," Make an unmute that."
"2949340","2952320"," Then we'll take a look at tomorrow for some ranges. "
"2954020","2955980"," Four and let me ask you guys in stream."
"2956260","2957260"," I'm not going to miss it."
"2957360","2957760"," I'm going to do a."
"2958560","2959960"," I'm going to do a poll in here. "
"2960240","2962320"," I don't know how to do a poll on both right now."
"2964610","2965850"," You're going to learn how to do that."
"2966490","2967410"," I want to do a poll. "
"2967670","2969350"," Let me ask just ask you in stream to comment."
"2970010","2971410"," During that joint statement."
"2971850","2978410"," Do you think we get 50 BPS 25 BPS a pause or some kind of a."
"2980110","2983430"," Rate cut decision tomorrow and I'll tell you right away. "
"2983590","2985450"," I think we get 25 BPS."
"2986590","2991650"," And I think we get some kind of a stern talking to."
"2993030","2995530"," But then I think after that is said. "
"2996690","2998830"," You're going to get some kind of a."
"2999570","3000850"," Talk about."
"3002210","3006130"," Some kind of a non hawkish speech about the banks."
"3008550","3012130"," That's the part that I don't know how well that goes over with. "
"3015050","3017130"," Maybe that's something that the market doesn't have to deal with."
"3017290","3018810"," It's something that the public."
"3019130","3020590"," Joe public has to deal with. "
"3030410","3031650"," Let me see what you guys are saying."
"3031870","3032170"," No surprise."
"3032470","3032550"," Yeah. "
"3032770","3033410"," Duvish 25."
"3033850","3035290"," Pause classy and same pause."
"3035950","3036770"," I think they should pause. "
"3038090","3038910"," Do you want the truth?"
"3039810","3041250"," I think they're going to backstop banks here."
"3041390","3042670"," They should pause rates as well."
"3043970","3045410"," That's what I think they should do. "
"3046130","3049210"," I don't think this goes over well with the public."
"3050210","3053110"," And I think that I think that becomes a big discussion."
"3054050","3055210"," If they do 25 BPS. "
"3057950","3059770"," They should stay the course, but they're not right."
"3059990","3061190"," We know they're not staying the course."
"3062270","3063390"," The course is broken. "
"3064410","3065610"," Let's get that right out in the open."
"3066390","3068630"," Your course is not your course anymore."
"3070450","3071490"," Without a doubt. "
"3072670","3074130"," We don't have the court."
"3074410","3075550"," We don't have to call it a."
"3076210","3077930"," I think we'd have to call it something like."
"3079110","3080290"," We're going to fuck you. "
"3081750","3083070"," Well, we don't get fucked."
"3084190","3085430"," And you're eventually going."
"3085550","3089830"," We're going to eventually go into high inflation, right?"
"3090330","3091170"," Or accepted inflation. "
"3095290","3096430"," Data dependent, I like it."
"3099480","3102520"," And no signal pause of the hawkish stance on the economy."
"3103100","3104040"," Raise 100 points. "
"3106480","3107340"," Yeah, I don't think."
"3108540","3111920"," You know, the fed positive now will screw the goal of having inflation to control."
"3112660","3113840"," Inflation is out the window. "
"3114640","3115280"," You guys are going to pay."
"3115540","3116160"," You guys aren't going to."
"3116280","3119020"," Maybe some of you may know this now, but some of you may not. "
"3119580","3121320"," Your balance sheet going up like that."
"3121440","3122240"," The bond market."
"3122600","3123220"," You are going to. "
"3123440","3124080"," You are going to pay."
"3125400","3126620"," I assure you."
"3127800","3131980"," That you we've now almost guaranteed an inflation spike at this point. "
"3132560","3134500"," Regardless of a 25 BPS."
"3135500","3136460"," We're almost guaranteed."
"3136840","3137240"," Not even almost. "
"3137520","3138980"," We're guaranteed an inflation spike."
"3144030","3145010"," I agree with that."
"3145430","3146650"," I agree with that statement still. "
"3147370","3150250"," So Omar is saying if the fed positive now, it will."
"3150850","3154350"," To the goal of having the inflation of control since rates are still negative."
"3156230","3158710"," I don't disagree with that at all. "
"3158770","3160290"," I still agree with that statement."
"3161150","3163910"," But your fight and inflation is now out the window."
"3168830","3170390"," Even with 25 BPS. "
"3175830","3177370"," Raise my five BBS market tank."
"3177670","3179170"," Five to seven percent."
"3179330","3180230"," Let's talk about that too. "
"3180790","3183930"," After you guys are done in the chat telling us what you think is going to happen."
"3184590","3186650"," We'll chart out what the expectation should be tomorrow."
"3194160","3194600"," Yeah. "
"3196520","3197420"," I agree with this."
"3197600","3199320"," I agree with the inflation rate needs to be above."
"3199700","3201600"," I think that we're missing something here. "
"3201600","3203460"," So then I agree with all of this."
"3203640","3206040"," Omar, the issue here is that."
"3206120","3210320"," Expecting comments from China's president and Putin during their life statement. "
"3212020","3213480"," They print money for a printer."
"3213700","3214800"," How will they be destroyed?"
"3215060","3215640"," They own this country."
"3216100","3216760"," Yeah, I don't. "
"3218060","3223540"," If he comes out and says that like 25 BPS tomorrow and we're still going to fight inflation."
"3224440","3228320"," This backstopping erases all of that."
"3228880","3229340"," It's a race. "
"3230980","3231660"," It's a race."
"3231900","3233600"," So it's either a lie or."
"3234040","3236680"," A lot of statement from China's president. "
"3237020","3238320"," We did hear from."
"3238480","3239840"," I think I'm going to give."
"3240100","3242260"," I'm going to give the no rate increase. "
"3244840","3247580"," More possibility than I would before, even though I don't."
"3248020","3249180"," Think that's going to happen."
"3262160","3263740"," Read what you guys are saying. "
"3266060","3269720"," Jim say because if something is breaking, they'll be slaughtered because of it."
"3269720","3272160"," Twenty-five to settle on March the 28th."
"3272180","3272980"," Son of the idea. "
"3272980","3275460"," Powell doesn't want to make the same mistake as Volcker."
"3275600","3276900"," Powell will raise minimum 25."
"3277720","3278940"," It wouldn't be surprising 50. "
"3285400","3286500"," Yeah, no, it doesn't work."
"3286840","3287320"," You can't."
"3287780","3290540"," I agree with rates needing to be over inflation. "
"3291780","3295980"," A hundred percent, but you have to remove liquidity from the system as well."
"3296180","3297040"," If you're not doing that."
"3297980","3298760"," It doesn't. "
"3298900","3300140"," It still doesn't jive."
"3306840","3307240"," Yeah."
"3307300","3309080"," And that's what GP 8008 is saying. "
"3309420","3312800"," He's saying the fed added 300 billion to the balance sheet."
"3313040","3316980"," Bumping rates again seems stupid if it is going to keep on doing all their QT progress."
"3317600","3318440"," I agree with that. "
"3318780","3320000"," I'm on that boat right now."
"3321080","3322460"," I'm on that boat right now."
"3323380","3327800"," We're in like the absurd stage of we're trying to fight inflation. "
"3328060","3329320"," I mean, you're going to get laughed out of a room."
"3333370","3335010"," You'll get laughed out of a room, right?"
"3335010","3337030"," I would think that you would be laughed out of a room."
"3350920","3355080"," I do wonder if this is setting up a more likelihood of war down the road too. "
"3363430","3367230"," I'm reading some of these Yellen comments from this morning and my face is melting off."
"3368870","3372510"," Yellen is saying, despite recent pressure, the banking system is sound."
"3373490","3377610"," She's committed to taking actions that will mitigate financial stability risk. "
"3378890","3383110"," She also says it is necessary to ensure that the Federal Reserve is capable of providing the"
"3383110","3385070"," liquidity that banks require."
"3385450","3386310"," I agree with all of this."
"3386770","3387890"," We have to provide liquidity. "
"3388310","3396270"," You're going to remove money from the system and fight inflation with rates."
"3397030","3397570"," I get it, right?"
"3398210","3400650"," You're going to remove the excess money in the system."
"3401810","3406430"," You're not creating new money, but you're going to re-provide that money you got took out of the"
"3406430","3407170"," system again. "
"3409290","3413670"," So we know that we're not in a QT stance, right?"
"3414270","3416690"," We're in like a half foot in and a half foot out."
"3419230","3422210"," And we also backstop bonds, right?"
"3422410","3424130"," We're going to take care of any of these bondholders."
"3426650","3429910"," She's also saying it's too early to decide on regulatory changes. "
"3430670","3435370"," It is really essential for Congress to act to suspend or raise the debt limit."
"3436950","3440490"," I'm worried about waiting until the last minute tax and the debt limit."
"3440490","3441590"," That's absurd too. "
"3444990","3449590"," The dollar status as a reserve currency of the United States should be cherished and not be"
"3449590","3450310"," jeopardized."
"3455120","3456480"," So much double talk."
"3462720","3465540"," If they stopped raising rates, we would create a panic in the banking system. "
"3465540","3473180"," Yeah, I think we crash if they pause or cut rates."
"3473720","3474120"," Absolutely."
"3474620","3475580"," I mean, that same camp. "
"3480410","3484990"," Bank crisis is a true collateral damage of the erratic decision of maintaining the rates almost"
"3484990","3486010"," zero for so long."
"3486730","3489930"," A portion of banks put their money on treasury bonds and ended up losing its value by the time"
"3489930","3491730"," these banks were in need to sell them."
"3491730","3493730"," Yes, I agree with all this to Omar. "
"3494090","3497210"," So I think that's my question is where does it leave us."
"3500110","3500830"," Does it leave?"
"3501330","3507130"," Omar, you're almost you're almost setting up the argument for which is what I said."
"3507130","3508130"," You're going to accept inflation. "
"3508410","3511130"," They're going to force feed inflationary."
"3511710","3513270"," Omar is making a lot of sense here."
"3514590","3518430"," But I think it sets up that whole thing of, hey, we're just going to accept inflation down the"
"3518430","3518850"," road, right?"
"3519390","3520610"," We're just going to pass the fucking buck. "
"3523010","3524130"," We're going to pass the buck."
"3524750","3527090"," It ends up being passed to the next generation."
"3528130","3529050"," Just the fraud goes on. "
"3534890","3535850"," And that is where they're fucked."
"3536030","3537970"," Omar is laying it all out quite well right now."
"3539670","3540590"," And that's right. "
"3540810","3541070"," That's right."
"3541930","3545850"," You know, it's like you write all this stuff down in a piece of paper and it all circles right"
"3545850","3546710"," back around to."
"3547790","3549250"," You're not going to fucking do this. "
"3550110","3551250"," You're going to let the fraud go on."
"3560020","3563780"," If they were going to let the fraud go on, you wouldn't see the backstopping of these of these"
"3563780","3565420"," banks that took on too much risk."
"3566120","3567080"," And they know that they can't. "
"3567780","3570080"," You'll hear some of these collapse bears say that stuff."
"3570840","3576120"," They'll say that we'll hear the one side that's like modern monetary theory is dead."
"3577000","3580200"," But then you'll see some of them in the background say, oh, they're not going to do that because"
"3580200","3583500"," they know that they have to run. "
"3583500","3584800"," They can ride this train until it crashes."
"3586480","3588500"," And they won't crash it intentionally themselves."
"3590460","3592040"," Right not on their watch right. "
"3592380","3594440"," Let's leave it for the next person to take care of."
"3602540","3605500"," Yeah, I think that I think what we're looking at is."
"3606360","3608740"," I think what we're looking at is. "
"3610780","3612900"," I have this thought that."
"3613860","3615660"," They're looking down the road and saying."
"3617240","3618460"," Do they buy this. "
"3620160","3624620"," And how much longer can we do this until they actually accept all this bull all this."
"3625740","3627840"," Garbage so we can continue higher again."
"3630080","3632580"," You'll pay bucks for eggs and you're going to like it. "
"3637260","3638380"," Yeah, I agree with that too."
"3638500","3639640"," The fed wants one bank."
"3640940","3645680"," UBS and credit Swiss is looking at like that right smells just like it. "
"3646280","3647000"," National banking."
"3654200","3656080"," The feds raise rates by 50 bps."
"3658200","3665500"," That's what I think I I'm on the I think the fed path that they laid out for the agreement"
"3665500","3666160"," with everyone. "
"3666880","3668820"," Is a bullshit farce."
"3670060","3671900"," I think it's a bullshit farce."
"3673180","3674500"," I think it's a scam. "
"3681290","3685110"," Yeah, so just some guy too is saying or just some guy."
"3685610","3689630"," He's saying that perhaps they do both raise rates and backstop both sides."
"3690110","3691230"," Happy short term. "
"3691470","3692290"," Yeah, I think the."
"3693010","3696430"," I think that's the key here is if they do the back stopping and the raising of rates."
"3697090","3699450"," I think what it's doing is it's telling you. "
"3700190","3702570"," The scam is going to the fraud is going to continue."
"3702570","3707250"," And you're eventually going to be forced into accepting just higher inflation."
"3708110","3714630"," Maybe 3% or 5% and you're going to accept the price of things being higher permanently. "
"3715670","3718890"," And we just need more time for that to become accepted."
"3728970","3732950"," DeMartino booth saying anyone who's seen anything systemic if not, then full speed ahead."
"3733930","3735710"," And then what they're doing and giving the fact. "
"3735710","3737950"," I was not economist doesn't know how it works."
"3738150","3739690"," Yeah, that's true to you isn't dizzy."
"3750240","3752640"," Take a look on some different timelines here. "
"3760850","3762550"," Check the one minute real quick."
"3766140","3767720"," Still in consolidation here."
"3770420","3774480"," I'm looking for pairs looking for a little bit of rejection above here and R2. "
"3774960","3778200"," Try to send this down on a five minute though."
"3780180","3783560"," Still supportive here on the five minute line, the red line."
"3783560","3785300"," And then the 15 minute. "
"3786980","3790400"," See next level of support below right down here."
"3790860","3795760"," And then on the one minute, our one hour chart with Jeremy Hans speaks to the house of rules panel."
"3796740","3797980"," Still trend, right?"
"3798300","3800140"," Trend is still will still be. "
"3800500","3801380"," Hold on a second here."
"3802320","3808880"," Trend still supportive down below in a one hour move the direction is still up here, not down."
"3808880","3815060"," And the four hour. "
"3818030","3821690"," You can see even on the four hour, you're just watching for consolidation here."
"3823810","3825210"," Just time for."
"3827690","3830490"," Just time needed for this consolidation to move higher. "
"3832920","3837880"," So according to CNBC bank CEO, they're discussing the future outcome for first republic."
"3843520","3846520"," Just watching this consolidation for move higher."
"3847540","3849580"," We get one quick rip lower. "
"3850360","3852300"," And then that rip higher in the market."
"3852800","3853780"," Or do we lose."
"3854660","3857280"," Support we reject here tomorrow and had lower. "
"3857720","3860300"," Is that's the biggest question for today and tomorrow."
"3862020","3867260"," And seem to be according to seem to see again bank CEO's focused on the one to four month time"
"3867260","3869500"," frame if the first republic sale fails."
"3869500","3875460"," As long as price remains above this two ninety two seventy three two ninety three three ninety"
"3875460","3876220"," three fifty four. "
"3876640","3878540"," Bulls will stay in control."
"3879100","3880380"," This is even into tomorrow."
"3880800","3884060"," Even we slip below and trade higher again. "
"3884560","3886780"," There should be the support of environments right here."
"3887340","3891020"," Key levels here for bulls is this pivot into tomorrow."
"3891720","3894120"," If there's a if there's a drop below. "
"3894120","3895960"," Let's see you get twenty five BPS."
"3896280","3897160"," Come back up."
"3897340","3897840"," We're good to go. "
"3898360","3900320"," If we get the rip below and it rejects."

"5343420","5347600"," We'll look at the cues let me go back and we'll do the cues and we'll do VIX real quick."
"5356220","5361620"," Two staying bullish nothing bearish about it just as last week we talked about which stocks looked"
"5361620","5362800"," bullish and which didn't. "
"5364540","5369060"," Two still staying on trend right now as long as cues keep it up."
"5371240","5377040"," The cues only have to maintain three oh five sixty nine currently as long as it maintains three oh"
"5377040","5377880"," nine sixty five."
"5377880","5384160"," Look for a dip to buy if that dip fails there they're going to be looking for two ninety eight"
"5384160","5385240"," thirteen on the cues. "
"5387020","5391080"," Putin says Russia is ready to increase oil supplies to China according to."
"5391380","5396180"," Here's the VIX right now this is a VIX on a fifteen minute chart we can look at it on"
"5396180","5397020"," a one minute as well."
"5397680","5402060"," Just for right now you can see the VIX is looking like it's pretty rough right now right. "
"5402060","5409680"," If VIX stays below twenty two oh seven we can continue to see downtrend in the market begin to"
"5409680","5411980"," squeeze even higher believe it or not."
"5411980","5417840"," You can see price just stay below this twenty one ninety three moment if it can't you see the"
"5417840","5418340"," squeeze higher."
"5418720","5422560"," Then you'll see tech stocks are to roll over down to their daily trading. "
"5425400","5427720"," Let's look at VIX on a one minute chart."
"5433980","5436980"," Putin says LNG supplies to China willing."
"5436980","5438120"," Same thing right here. "
"5438380","5444860"," So here on VIX right just take a look on VIX right now you can see this hourly coming down."
"5445460","5450340"," So as we come down this hourly right here if you get the squeeze on VIX currently let's say VIX"
"5450340","5452220"," starts to squeeze up twenty three forty."
"5452920","5455700"," That's going to be the sign that the market's going to roll and you're going to go down to the"
"5455700","5457960"," hourly triggers that I showed you on these other tickers. "
"5459020","5465540"," But if we don't if we get a firm rejection here you'll see those hourlies hold on the market and"
"5465540","5468680"," we will continue higher and begin to squeeze."
"5474560","5481200"," So key points here would be if VIX can hold itself up you'll see the market come down and look"
"5481200","5482400"," for a dip buy down below."
"5482400","5487860"," You'll more than likely see those hourly triggers get broken and we'll come down to the daily. "
"5488260","5490860"," This would be the daily on all those tech stocks."
"5510460","5517100"," Tesla trading higher than its weekly then its weekly now Tesla wants to hold right where it"
"5517100","5518300"," currently sits right now."
"5523160","5532900"," Tesla trading 194.79 snap yourself a line right at 194.07. Tesla wants"
"5532900","5541900"," to treat that as support and Tesla doesn't want to see that support get broken here. "
"5542360","5543740"," You want to see that support hold."
"5544960","5559500"," If Tesla does have a pullback it will be 185.75. See"
"5559500","5560900"," if it can get a nice squeeze on Tesla."
"5592550","5594270"," 185.59 to be more exact. "
"5626830","5628770"," VIX showing some strength currently."
"5637980","5641340"," Where do I think we go to tomorrow on the spy over 400, 405."
"5641880","5645280"," Well the market is not priced in to go higher than that number. "
"5650310","5652110"," Yeah I'm I'm not buying here."
"5660880","5662100"," I'm looking for weakness myself."
"5662640","5665280"," I'm trying to buy it out here somewhere right down in here. "
"5667380","5670380"," I'm trying to buy it out in here for my cursors."
"5672960","5674500"," I'm going to do INTC next."
"5677120","5689070"," Hold on a second I'll do some of you guys are asking for me a second here. "
"5691510","5693230"," We'll do INTC next."
"5704160","5710620"," PCB's Enriya says there is no direct read across of the US events to Euro area significant banks."
"5711720","5713420"," So let's look at INTC. "
"5714420","5715900"," A 30 minute chart."
"5717080","5720040"," We have a full on INTC."
"5733520","5736260"," We see here that it didn't hold 31 right. "
"5737300","5738560"," Didn't get above 31."
"5739740","5743680"," Sold before it even got there right by a dip above 31 didn't get it."
"5744720","5752340"," I didn't mean looking for INTC for buyers to step in at 2764. "
"5754240","5758320"," If you want to look for a rebuy on on INTC."
"5762990","5764470"," Right down where it is here."
"5765670","5770230"," You need to put stops below those stops below 2761. "
"5782510","5787630"," And not only stops below this 2761 but you really don't even want to buy this right now."
"5787650","5788450"," You really want to see."
"5789530","5792710"," You want to see INTC come down and consolidate a little bit at least right. "
"5793530","5795910"," Then watch the hourly get underneath it."
"5796010","5802650"," And you want to see a break above this weekly here."
"5802650","5804310"," So there's work to be done in here. "
"5804350","5806090"," It's very volatile and dangerous in here."
"5806750","5808550"," If you're trading INTC."
"5809750","5812070"," All in all you probably are looking for. "
"5812990","5818010"," You're looking for this consolidation but also price to show you the way."
"5818190","5819910"," So maybe check back with me today or tomorrow."
"5820870","5822230"," If price can get above. "
"5823010","5825230"," For where we are right now price needs to now get above."
"5826150","5827170"," It's just $28."
"5827830","5829030"," But I think it's going to take time. "
"5829030","5832270"," This could end up taking Friday maybe."
"5833250","5838510"," Maybe Friday for INTC maybe even Monday for this to work itself out."
"5857510","5858770"," Wasn't another one so far. "
"5861490","5863010"," It doesn't look weak to me right here."
"5863050","5863830"," It looks fine."
"5864270","5865830"," It made a nice perfect run over here. "
"5865870","5866290"," It looks great."
"5867030","5869030"," This all looks like consolidation here."
"5869830","5871970"," This is actually pretty strong for INTC. "
"5872390","5874070"," This is all productive stuff here."
"5874070","5876030"," You're seeing stuff like this in here."
"5876130","5876910"," This is all productive. "
"5877930","5880990"," It hasn't broken its bottom once."
"5881530","5883330"," So I like all of this in INTC."
"5883890","5885190"," This is all to me consolidation. "
"5886110","5887550"," And it's actually leading to something here."
"5888330","5891230"," That doesn't mean it doesn't blast lower here and go to the depths of hell."
"5891950","5894210"," But you do want to see what takes place in here. "
"5894650","5896710"," If you can get bought and price can get above."
"5896990","5899250"," It'd be very bullish on INTC."
"5901010","5901810"," Not so weak. "
"5902610","5907230"," When you're looking at INTC, it's not technically weak."
"5908150","5911070"," This is what you want to see on recovering stocks."
"5911070","5920340"," Let's look at sofai. "
"5920680","5921940"," Some of you requested sofai."
"5925010","5925610"," Weak."
"5927050","5928850"," I'm bearish on sofai currently. "
"5930070","5930990"," At least on the daily."
"5931730","5933490"," I'm going to keep looking for some rejection here."
"5936510","5938410"," Or at least not the squeeze yet. "
"5938630","5940550"," Now with that set on sofai."
"5943820","5944720"," Sofai looks weak."
"5954070","5958830"," If price can get above $6, you could get a squeeze trade out of this. "
"5959510","5960690"," You don't want the reversal though."
"5960830","5962530"," You don't want to get caught in here like you buy this right here."
"5962630","5963990"," It automatically reverses on you. "
"5964710","5965170"," And heads lower."
"5966390","5971380"," You want to see price get above here."
"5974140","5974960"," There's the trade. "
"5974960","5984380"," And you know this one comes down here."
"5984560","5985880"," So the trade might have to be lower."
"5989870","5994170"," Keep an eye on it at like $5, $85, $6, $5, $80 somewhere in there. "
"5995030","5996490"," Now with some tight stops underneath."
"5997810","5999250"," So we can get this down here."
"6000190","6001830"," You can get price to come above. "
"6003110","6005570"," Could be a nice squeeze trade."
"6006610","6007670"," But it's hella dangerous."
"6008010","6011670"," You have to be like $5, $6, $5, $80 with tight stops underneath. "
"6012830","6013670"," Tight stops."
"6015370","6017610"," Trying to attack that eight bucks above here."
"6018170","6019130"," Squeeze back higher. "
"6019750","6022110"," You have to be fearful of hidden sellers in here though too."
"6022950","6026830"," You know there's like an idea here that let's say you get that squeeze."
"6027290","6028630"," It just starts to roll again. "
"6029450","6031930"," Just taking out these sellers above."
"6033870","6036570"," So I'd even be wary of it at $5, $60 man."
"6036710","6037290"," I'm telling you what. "
"6037550","6037750"," Hold on."
"6037950","6038710"," Let's try this out."
"6042170","6044090"," And you see how they just teeing off here. "
"6049120","6052120"," There's danger here for so far."
"6055620","6057480"," And this doesn't have to be pretty either."
"6060880","6061360"," Yeah. "
"6061540","6063500"," Sellers, sellers, sellers, right?"
"6065800","6073460"," So, you know, maybe there's a trade here between, there might be a trade here between like $5 and"
"6073460","6075800"," $6 but you don't want that automatic reversal due."
"6077400","6079520"," So you kind of have to hold."
"6080800","6084160"," Like even if you get above here, you need that hourly to come up. "
"6084320","6086300"," You need the one in the five to be supportive."
"6087780","6089220"," How about a retest?"
"6089500","6093180"," Let's say you hold $6 in a successful retest."
"6093980","6094840"," There's your squeeze. "
"6095080","6095700"," And so you see that?"
"6096920","6098880"," Looks like bears traps everywhere."
"6103620","6104460"," Come on now."
"6107080","6107980"," So far dangerous. "
"6109000","6113020"," You need to see like, remember in Tesla, I was like, if you get above $185, you're going to get"
"6113020","6113300"," a run."
"6114300","6116840"," If you don't see that consolidation and move higher."
"6119380","6121920"," And you don't see that consolidation and move higher. "
"6123140","6123880"," It's dangerous trade."
"6144650","6147030"," Spine out testing lower support right now."
"6147250","6148930"," So this is the lower support on spy. "
"6148930","6155050"," This is your daily weekly and monthly support levels for spy."
"6156850","6157530"," 39362."
"6158670","6161350"," So this this hourly support is now come up higher. "
"6163830","6167490"," 39362 right here."
"6185250","6188130"," Gap to close below on spy from pre market."
"6188950","6190410"," See that gap right here. "
"6204820","6205540"," 9566."
"6214660","6217080"," Break below 39566."
"6219160","6221360"," And you'll have price target down below. "

"6271590","6273370"," Nice little bear cross over here."
"6274490","6275150"," On the one minute. "
"6277570","6280350"," The five minute start fires stepping in currently."
"6284940","6287020"," You want to see this cross come over here."
"6295420","6298120"," There's one to defend 39563. "
"6300220","6300620"," 66."

"6336690","6338730"," You saw that upper resistance get tagged on Tesla. "
"6339330","6341250"," If price remains below."
"6343710","6347750"," 195 and 194 and change 194 20 194 50."

"6543340","6545220"," Not a place to really be long here."
"6545220","6549860"," We're not here but between 116 and 170."
"6550340","6552200"," You're looking or they're going to be looking to sell this. "

"6570460","6572140"," Let's call it 116 flat."
"6573000","6573980"," It's not a place."
"6574300","6575580"," This is kind of like did in the middle. "
"6575840","6576740"," You don't ever want to do that."
"6577620","6578820"," So I'm just going to change this."
"6580260","6582140"," You see you know you see it come up here. "
"6582280","6583580"," You don't want to be messing around in this."
"6583780","6585680"," You want to get it priced to get above."
"6586280","6588020"," Take the next leg of this trade. "

"6601080","6603160"," trade this 140 overall though. "
"6604300","6606020"," This is still productive for Etsy."
"6607260","6612020"," The one thing you don't want to see here though is that reversal for that second leg lower right."
"6612360","6618760"," So you'll see the continuation of distribution is the conversation I'm talking to you about. "
"6618920","6619440"," You don't want to see."
"6622260","6626660"," You don't want to see this and then we continue lower on Etsy right now."
"6626660","6633140"," You don't want to see that but you don't want to see this consolidation fail and get your role in"
"6633140","6633980"," the back end of Etsy. "

"6653800","6655700"," You're waiting for it to hold. "
"6660420","6663540"," You want to see that like you don't want to be involved in this part."

"6683680","6686100"," Not a bad part of the trade here right take the money and run."
"6686860","6692060"," Then you let this consolidation happen here you can actually trade this zone if you wanted 120 to"
"6692060","6692320"," 140. "
"6693160","6695200"," The big trade though is right here."
"6696440","6699740"," Or the long term trade if you're a bull if you're not see bull."

"6725170","6727970"," I'll give you some more some more more exacting targets."
"6729750","6732250"," So it's kind of shows the same thing right in Etsy. "
"6733070","6733550"," So."
"6735390","6736290"," You've got one."
"6737290","6739110"," One 16 61. "
"6739650","6741790"," I don't know you get completely up here."
"6741890","6743050"," Trend is down though."
"6743290","6745210"," I want you to realize that trend is down in Etsy. "
"6745750","6747890"," This is that bearishness I'm talking to you about."
"6748630","6751830"," So you don't want to see us like one 14 or so."
"6752550","6755070"," Sellers will step in like one 14 in Etsy. "
"6755870","6757950"," You have no business being in here either."
"6758230","6759430"," You kind of like take the money and run."
"6760350","6762890"," And then what you're kind of looking for here is. "
"6764270","6766650"," This is bullish though the daily is bullish on Etsy."
"6767390","6768550"," So I'm not completely."
"6769390","6773030"," I'm not completely I'm not anti the I'm not saying to you. "
"6773650","6774770"," I'm bearish here."
"6774970","6777670"," I'm saying to you that the sellers are going to step in."
"6778290","6780330"," I want to sell this down at one 14. "
"6780330","6784570"," And this is not the place to put risk on there."
"6784930","6787330"," The place to put risk on is above."
"6788330","6792450"," Currently one 31 83 and probably a successful retest of it. "
"6792830","6797130"," So if you are bullish here and all signs are pointing towards bullishness on Etsy."
"6798370","6800010"," They kind of take the money and run."
"6800550","6802290"," You want to see the hourly come up. "
"6802510","6804350"," You want to see these get underneath."
"6806070","6809830"," You want to see price come up fail consolidate rip higher."
"6810950","6812770"," Consolidate rip higher consolidate. "
"6812770","6818590"," And that's where the real money shot is right there like above one 32 waiting below it's like one"
"6818590","6821170"," one 30 or something or sorry not one 30."
"6821310","6824390"," Yeah, quite a little one 30 somewhere in there 130 maybe."
"6824870","6827310"," A lot of work to be done in here. "
"6828530","6830990"," If you want just we're slowing the market."
"6830990","6832490"," I can check on this for you."
"6834150","6838130"," Over time like once a week once twice a week or some just pop in and everybody's here. "
"6838450","6839170"," You're a DM."
"6841110","6842670"," Because it is coming to a place, right?"
"6842810","6844970"," It's kind of a place where you're going to get high volatility."
"6846110","6847450"," Although this is all constructive. "
"6850680","6852000"," If you can see anything else."
"6852320","6853520"," As some pieces increase."
"6854000","6856480"," I'm assuming this is the gap you want to close over here. "
"6856780","6858300"," Banks cost of capital."
"6858480","6859300"," We're now sellers."
"6859580","6860540"," 81 issuance. "
"6860660","6862220"," Try to start blasting higher again."
"6864240","6865800"," Definitely a dangerous area in here."

"6890960","6892380"," Having some missing."
"6895440","6896780"," Do you see that?"
"6897360","6898680"," I'm missing the. "
"6899120","6901200"," These weekend forces of market competition."
"6903440","6905080"," I'm missing where I wrote."
"6905980","6907180"," Price target below. "
"6907180","6912640"," And task news in geopolitics as the Russian defence minister Shorgue says there are fewer and fewer"
"6912640","6914800"," steps left towards a nuclear collision."
"6924160","6925660"," I think into those numbers again."
"6925820","6926020"," Hold on. "
"6926540","6927420"," Put them back on there."
"6927720","6928580"," I don't know why they just spared."
"6929620","6931020"," Just won't get us right now. "
"6941240","6942200"," 95 63."
"6992730","6993210"," 39378."
"7026880","7027700"," Very soon. "
"7028260","7029360"," Very, very soon."
"7030040","7031720"," But only that we get some other cool stuff."
"7032560","7034220"," On the on the triggers too. "
"7034460","7035700"," We have some cooler stuff on it."
"7036860","7039720"," You have some other things you haven't."
"7039720","7040900"," Things I haven't shown you here. "
"7055810","7058050"," You know it's crazy too is I'm looking at."
"7062810","7065030"," This isn't the crazy part of us."
"7065210","7067110"," I'm looking at the breadth of the market. "
"7068910","7070410"," And someone asked earlier."
"7070970","7072330"," Can we go higher than four oh five."
"7072930","7074310"," If we get if we get market expansion. "
"7074970","7075090"," Yes."
"7076890","7078250"," If the way is up."
"7078550","7082910"," You know if we start trading above that or to that four oh five and we see call expansion. "
"7084570","7085050"," Yeah."
"7086750","7089830"," I think I think for 30 or 460 is on board."
"7089830","7092810"," I think we might. "
"7093210","7095390"," You know this conversation this morning."
"7096210","7097310"," Well it's now afternoon."
"7098210","7099670"," You have a cup of coffee here. "
"7100310","7101210"," Me one second here."
"7103370","7104810"," Me just one second one."
"7104930","7105510"," I have a quick chat. "
"7109090","7144180"," He says"
"7144180","7148520"," we have strong trust of the positives in European bank so which is well placed."
"7151640","7154000"," And so if you if you've known this since this morning."
"7155800","7157200"," Since the start of the broadcast. "
"7159560","7160960"," It lends the question."
"7162160","7164220"," Someone brought it up in chat a few minutes ago."
"7164500","7166420"," What about for what happens to get the four oh five. "
"7168180","7171160"," And this is the entire argument here."
"7173620","7177580"," Is is the way out of this all culminates with what the fed is doing."
"7178440","7179820"," The treasury department is doing. "
"7180660","7181460"," The banks are doing."
"7181460","7184560"," This is when the conversation of I'd be really angry."
"7185420","7187580"," If you weren't taken along for the ride. "
"7189320","7191700"," You're you trying to tell me out there that."
"7192360","7195580"," You're going to backstop banks but not anyone else."
"7198640","7200160"," And that becomes the question. "
"7201480","7204300"," We're not trading three or 400 again right."
"7204460","7205840"," We're up here at three ninety nine."
"7206680","7208660"," We're not quite three ninety six I guess. "
"7209480","7212580"," Three ninety eight thirty seven earlier this morning."
"7214380","7217380"," Right up there four thousand question becomes."
"7218280","7220040"," Are you going to punish the market. "
"7222750","7224610"," While you're enriching yourself."
"7226930","7229950"," Are you really the difference between main street the difference between."
"7231050","7234790"," The stock market the bond market difference between. "
"7236710","7241030"," Real life and fake life and it was funny because Jerome Powell said."
"7241670","7244850"," Depending upon where the market is will depend on how we hike."
"7246410","7248950"," He was quoted last week as saying that. "
"7249590","7250390"," I found that."
"7252350","7253830"," Found that to be."
"7257090","7258630"," Ironic that he said that. "
"7261720","7263960"," About the market I found that very ironic."
"7265040","7268980"," You know our rate path depends upon the price of the stock market."
"7269480","7270520"," And I'm like man you know. "
"7271760","7272820"," You kind of."
"7273160","7275640"," You're breaking the contract."
"7277040","7282840"," And I brought up you know earlier this morning I said does the general public it matter angry. "
"7284760","7288760"," And someone commented in the chat saying they probably don't even know."
"7289620","7291260"," I think that's a fair comment too."
"7292260","7295580"," Because they consume what they're told right most people out there. "
"7296620","7297640"," Don't know."
"7299140","7302700"," As a matter of fact I watch the 60 minutes program."
"7303360","7307320"," The that was shoveled into the mouths of people on China. "
"7308420","7311880"," This weekend and I'm always fascinated by 60 minutes."
"7312760","7314560"," I'm always fascinated by frontline."
"7315700","7318260"," Mostly because I want to see. "
"7319000","7322420"," The story that's woven for the general public."
"7323620","7328900"," And I was with the you know if any of you watch the 60 minutes this weekend about China in"
"7328900","7329940"," the United States Navy."
"7331180","7334000"," The most fascinating part to me. "
"7334980","7336320"," About that discussion."
"7337460","7338100"," Was."
"7339240","7341260"," I don't know if you know this or not. "
"7341260","7346520"," They never ever discussed or brought up fighting a two front war."
"7347900","7350220"," They only discussed China."
"7351000","7353840"," They didn't discuss the readiness of the United States. "
"7354580","7355800"," Fighting a two-fronted war."
"7356560","7359440"," They did hit two topics that I was a happy about."
"7359940","7364620"," They discussed the fact that even though China has more ships than us. "
"7365340","7368700"," They don't they didn't go to detail what those ships are."
"7368700","7371180"," Those ships are like little speed boats and shit."
"7371960","7373980"," They did highlight briefly that. "
"7374580","7379480"," Even though they have a larger Navy than us now in terms of total number of boats that in highlight"
"7379480","7382220"," what kind of boats to an extent they did."
"7382920","7386620"," They were talking about diesel aircraft carriers versus nuclear aircraft carriers."
"7388880","7390040"," They didn't talk about. "
"7390680","7394360"," They did they did discuss that were a veritable."
"7395280","7398700"," We own an island there right and we have allies there."
"7401240","7405180"," And they did discuss the size and projection of power. "
"7406400","7409080"," The US military is you know five or six times."
"7409720","7412920"," Larger than all navies combined in this in this world."
"7413520","7415020"," That's how big the difference is. "
"7415620","7418260"," Well they didn't bring up which I found fascinating at all."
"7418460","7422840"," I'm assuming that they were told don't even fucking ask about."
"7423820","7427260"," This question that's can you fight a two-fronted war. "
"7430600","7435000"," And that leads back to six or sixteen or front line."
"7435840","7439660"," And some of the comments in the chat about those people know."
"7440620","7443000"," And so that brings up the question four or five. "
"7443840","7446900"," If we're going to trade four or five or four four hundred."
"7448520","7452140"," Is that just a natural place to tee off from the solar market down."
"7453240","7454860"," Or is the market pointing us up. "
"7456400","7457620"," To higher highs."
"7460060","7464080"," And it is I mean it's pointing us up towards four thirty or four sixty."
"7465440","7471260"," And that becomes the question into this fed is do you ignore at some point the fed. "
"7471700","7473840"," And they say don't fight the fed but in all honesty."
"7475060","7481240"," If they're going to enrich themselves does the stock market attempt to enrich itself."
"7481240","7482680"," Along the way. "
"7495850","7497410"," Hey what's going on your right boyfriend."
"7502440","7504520"," That's right I got some of that Swedish goodness baby."
"7504860","7505840"," That's Swedish snooze. "
"7508710","7510510"," The answer sounds like yes."
"7513550","7516110"," Do we get a squeeze here is my question."
"7516530","7518510"," I'm going to start squeezing this bad boy right now. "
"7520170","7523730"," I mean I'm looking at HYG it looks pretty fucking bullish to me."
"7525050","7528950"," They couldn't sell what they couldn't sell HYG at."
"7529990","7534790"," You know seventy two ninety nine they couldn't sell HYG at seventy seventy three. "
"7535990","7539530"," They couldn't sell HYG at seventy two sixty seven."
"7541790","7545050"," The fed is telling you out there everything is fine."
"7546530","7548370"," There's no contagion. "
"7551910","7555630"," We're going to fight inflation over here but everything is fine."
"7555870","7556570"," If everything is fine."
"7558290","7559590"," Markets should go up right. "
"7562450","7565690"," Y'all aren't going to get rich out there without us getting rich with you."
"7571380","7572460"," Nice little squeeze."
"7574140","7577200"," It's kind of the place where the bears want to be teeing off is the one minute. "
"7577880","7580860"," It's where they teed off before you can see it."
"7584120","7586600"," Sellers stepped right in right squeeze higher."
"7587540","7589100"," The one minute here's the here's the crossover. "
"7589960","7591860"," This is where the big cross came in right here."
"7594470","7596430"," Right in there first bearish cross."
"7597790","7599390"," Second bearish cross right here. "
"7599690","7602150"," I want you to pay attention to this one right here."
"7602710","7604090"," It's the big boy right there."
"7604270","7605710"," The big bad boy right there. "
"7610350","7612110"," Second one right there is the first one."
"7612410","7613510"," Here would be the second one right here."
"7614350","7617450"," It's going to be with the last sellers to get below and break below. "
"7620280","7621140"," See it right there."
"7622820","7626520"," Teed off on the first bearish cross over second tee off to get a new low."
"7627480","7630180"," There's going to be looking for this to take this lower if they can't. "
"7630380","7631440"," It'll be back in bull's hands."
"7632320","7633620"," We're going to look at the five minute really quick."
"7634940","7635900"," Same kind of a thing. "
"7640530","7643010"," You can get a successful retest in a five minute."
"7643130","7643990"," There should be a long here."
"7645170","7646850"," This is a five minute chart right now. "
"7646930","7650510"," The statement that Russia and China say there can be no winners in a nuclear war."
"7650730","7651930"," It should never be unleashed."
"7654490","7655930"," They could be winners in nuclear war. "
"7655930","7656550"," They're wrong on that."
"7660450","7662370"," That's not as true as it used to be in my view."
"7662750","7663370"," Believe it or not. "
"7664730","7667470"," I mean it used to be true but not so much anymore."
"7669230","7670190"," Just right in here."
"7670330","7672230"," Just keep your eyes on price here. "
"7672970","7674790"," Price can successfully test."
"7676630","7677790"," The five minute right here."
"7677810","7679490"," You might have a long trade setting up. "
"7680070","7681170"," Not guaranteeing it."
"7681930","7682390"," We'll see."
"7683730","7686370"," We don't squeeze above and retest this just fine. "
"7687230","7688650"," We could do the other way as well."
"7702240","7703780"," We're going to see this right here."
"7703840","7704820"," It's a nice beautiful cross. "
"7705960","7708860"," If you're going to take the short side of this trade, I'll probably jump in this with you with some"
"7708860","7709320"," day trades."
"7711420","7713140"," If we get a reversal here."
"7724870","7726630"," We can get some kind of reversal here. "
"7728930","7730310"," I'll take that trade with you down."
"7765000","7769060"," So according to Rhea, Russia and China joined statements as China."
"7769780","7773080"," Russia's relations are not confrontational towards other countries. "

"7799960","7800680"," They can't do shit."
"7803180","7804800"," They can't do shit, can they?"
"7808530","7811050"," Lots of people don't realize that first island chain man is."
"7811170","7813650"," Well, number one, China has no coastline. "
"7814170","7817930"," They have, like, for the size of their country, they're basically landlocked like Russia is."
"7818030","7821350"," Just to repeat, that Swiss makes the decisions on variable pay at Credit Suisse."
"7821350","7824150"," The second issue is that we own the chain. "
"7824550","7827690"," We basically own the gates to China and the high seas."
"7833570","7834450"," How you doing, Emerson?"
"7837290","7837970"," Yeah, man."
"7838110","7838770"," You're in line, definitely. "

"7845930","7847210"," It's not locked up by Guam."
"7849170","7852930"," And, you know, there's all kinds of issues with China. "
"7852930","7857030"," They've got their combat experience in Africa."
"7857150","7858590"," They've fled every battle."
"7859570","7861350"," Their equipment is untested. "
"7862050","7863510"," They have no old cadre."
"7864910","7868950"," You know, when forums that I'm in, there's, you know, discussion about this."
"7869510","7877010"," When you look back at World War I, World War II, people don't realize here is that all this cadre"
"7877010","7881770"," that was from the First World War even believe it. "
"7881870","7885290"," I think some of the Spanish American, I think that could be wrong in that."
"7885730","7888890"," But this cadre that was left over for when we went to World War II."
"7889390","7892810"," These are old people, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s. "
"7893490","7902090"," And they were left to raise up young troops, train young troops, lead young troops in World War II"
"7902710","7907390"," so that we had a war fighter"
"7907390","7915870"," history built into a new generation of young people."
"7916350","7918230"," And we have that in the United States."
"7918410","7923270"," We have that from Iraq and Afghanistan for a fight with China, which they don't have. "
"7924010","7928410"," They have unproven equipment, unproven, just no history of it."
"7928970","7930770"," That's another thing that's against China."
"7930770","7934430"," There is some danger with small, fast boats from China. "
"7935090","7938050"," We also have a submarine force that's, you know, unreal."
"7939010","7943310"," It was interesting in that show that was on, I think it was 60 minutes."
"7943750","7946570"," I was talking to your wife's boyfriend or jazz the other day. "
"7947110","7951730"," And they had said, the first thing they do is the US will cut off the Internet in the United"
"7951730","7952130"," States."
"7952570","7959290"," And they talked about that in that program this Sunday that the fight should start in space."
"7959290","7966410"," That would be my expectation that you would see the Internet cut off in the United States. "
"7967170","7967610"," Almost immediately."
"7967990","7971990"," If not an Internet, if not, they might cut it off immediately and then you might just get an"
"7971990","7976750"," Internet pre-programming from prior to war."
"7992620","7993280"," Yeah, they do. "
"7993480","7995060"," They've got an abundance of foot soldiers."
"7995520","7999320"," That was the scariest part of it, Jimmy, was how do you defeat?"
"8000060","8002220"," I only see like EMP, right?"
"8002400","8007620"," EMP would be the only thing that I could think of and how you defeat that many soldiers."
"8009300","8013680"," And the damage that we've done to US soldiers is just seeing that kind of death and destruction. "
"8016440","8020020"," And I saw someone last night talking about B-52s."
"8020380","8023580"," You'd probably have to bring back carpet bombing of some kind."
"8025020","8027760"," Well, the precision ammunition probably wouldn't do it. "
"8033100","8036120"," Yeah, I don't think they have zero hope to ever send."
"8036260","8037340"," I agree with you 100%."
"8039930","8041890"," Yeah, and I agree with you in present tense too. "
"8043630","8048830"," And our worm, or at least our shipbuilding is a disaster right now."
"8049770","8050910"," Absolute fucking disasters."
"8051590","8056350"," I have a measure of variable remuneration for financial years up to 2022 and thereafter. "
"8056350","8066170"," Although I do give, I was in an aviation forum with some pilots and stuff and they were all pissed"
"8066170","8066970"," off at me."
"8067650","8070290"," Whereas the Navy subreddit's not so much."
"8070950","8073630"," They know that it's all unmanned coming. "
"8074470","8082010"," The pilots though are angry about unmanned aviation, which is the future, right?"
"8082270","8082750"," We all know that."
"8082750","8093200"," And we are"
"8093200","8093560"," switching."
"8095320","8098560"," We are switching from a coin position, right?"
"8098700","8106520"," Brigade level logistics driven to brigade level combat teams to a divisional leadership right now. "
"8107660","8108840"," The US military is at least."
"8118690","8120870"," Yeah, so futures trader 87."
"8122550","8123890"," How do you weigh in on that?"
"8124570","8125790"," I know pilots are pissed off. "
"8126770","8128150"," The forum is an amen."
"8128410","8135930"," They're angry about going from drones, invariably."
"8136550","8142450"," Even I think the second Navy or something, one of these guys has been an interview the day and said"
"8142450","8143530"," the future is unmanned. "
"8144530","8146810"," At least from a naval perspective."
"8153550","8156730"," You were just talking about, are we headed?"
"8157550","8164110"," Is the market, is the Fed, is the treasury, is the US look like even more so heading to war?"
"8165990","8168530"," The debt cycles, all that kind of stuff that it was before."
"8172230","8173350"," Yeah, you know where it's going. "
"8175930","8179090"," You know, I know, if you're next Navy pile, you know where it's going."
"8179810","8184170"," You know, the fucked up part is that we take this stance and we mean business."
"8184550","8185350"," I don't think that they know. "
"8185550","8189170"," I don't think they understand that we don't fucking go off."
"8194010","8198750"," So one of the scariest things about the United States is that they don't bluff."
"8200889","8203070"," Yeah, we legitimately are. "
"8209780","8210719"," Yeah, I agree."
"8211160","8217219"," Some of that I think says UBS talk some vets in the background and some close forums and"
"8217219","8220219"," everybody's talking about bringing all that cadre back."
"8220820","8224959"," I'm not just being prepared by before the age out for it. "
"8225580","8233000"," It's bizarre because I'm like, it reminds me of what's his face from Saddam Hussein."
"8233440","8236160"," I didn't believe for a minute that the US would invade Iraq."
"8236820","8240360"," They thought we would like lead up and lead up to that point and it wouldn't take place. "
"8240520","8242540"," And I'm like, man, the US military does not fuck around."
"8242860","8250280"," When they see, when these war planners see the real threat, they will fucking take you out or"
"8250280","8251420"," they're going to come get you."
"8251639","8253480"," Even if they lose, they're coming to get you. "
"8255500","8256879"," So that's bizarre to me."
"8264120","8264740"," I don't know."
"8264840","8265860"," The Russia is a weird thing. "
"8266000","8268480"," There's this one general that likes to talk shit about."
"8268740","8272740"," We shouldn't be in Russia, but he's, you know, I wonder if they got, I wonder if they got, I"
"8272740","8275620"," mean, there's was one general that's not generally more."
"8275920","8278799"," It's one army general is like famous in the first Gulf War. "
"8278799","8284900"," You know, some, there's some noise from people with a podium saying we shouldn't be in Russia right"
"8284900","8285100"," now."
"8285540","8290360"," And I got a, I got a fucking think that they got some pictures or video of him fucking some"
"8290360","8290900"," broader."
"8291280","8294480"," Some kind of, some kind of badness. "
"8294480","8298719"," I should respond to, you know, Korea's legitimate and rational concerns and create."
"8298900","8300320"," Like I'm looking for like dialogue."
"8301860","8306480"," And there's a stark difference in what we're doing in Ukraine versus. "
"8307780","8309840"," We did in Afghanistan when Russia was in Afghanistan."
"8310219","8313320"," We're trying to murder and name as many Russians as possible."
"8314400","8319080"," And not end the war in Ukraine so we can, we can demolish the generation of their men. "
"8319600","8321340"," It doesn't matter where they come from."
"8321340","8324100"," It doesn't matter if they come from a minority."
"8324600","8332160"," The valuation of Credit Suisse shares and see it's C.E.T. one, minority society within Russia. "
"8332700","8334320"," It's, it's, it's grinding right now."
"8335600","8338240"," I would assume that Russia or U.S. doesn't want that Edward N."
"8339059","8341340"," You get to use all the old equipment from these European countries."
"8341840","8343160"," You feed funnel that on Ukraine. "
"8344200","8348459"," And then you give the excuse and the time for you, for the rest of NATO and Europe to prepare"
"8349180","8350139"," with modern weaponry."
"8351180","8351900"," Modern ammunition."
"8352420","8355040"," So they can help out of the front out. "
"8359530","8360670"," Yeah, poking a sleeping giant."
"8360910","8361549"," I don't think so, man."
"8361670","8362549"," I was stationed over there. "
"8362830","8363730"," I've been over there."
"8364049","8365030"," I spent time over there."
"8366389","8367190"," I disagree. "
"8368889","8370770"," I think it's bizarre when you've been there."
"8370889","8373690"," You're like, you're like, no fucking way."
"8373969","8374910"," Like people have no idea. "
"8375070","8377450"," They think they have an idea of how powerful we are."
"8378209","8381730"," They don't, they think, I guess they think we're the bubbling idiot, but when you're travel, when"
"8381730","8386969"," you're in the military and you get to travel, you get to actually see the, the projection of real"
"8386969","8388570"," power that the U.S. has."
"8389350","8393130"," We discount ourselves oftentimes as civilians not realizing. "
"8395190","8397370"," The actual power of the U.S. military."
"8401460","8408400"," Yeah, I'm not, I'm not a, I'm not a proponent of why we were in Iraq."
"8409900","8411880"," I think it was because of three things. "
"8412380","8413400"," We're in Iraq for three reasons."
"8413880","8415580"," Oil, Israel, and logistics."
"8416680","8417420"," Those three reasons. "
"8417620","8419080"," If you want another reason we're in Iraq, I'll tell you."
"8419640","8422100"," Oil, Israel, and logistics."
"8423020","8424180"," Those are the three reasons. "
"8424520","8425600"," Nobody told you I'm telling you."
"8427140","8427900"," That's why we're there."
"8449460","8450920"," Yeah, U.S. is the world police. "
"8451980","8454600"," And you kind of need the U.S. to be, well, world police."
"8456640","8458620"," Nice little squeeze happening right now in the spy."
"8459480","8462760"," See if we can get a retest of this five minute here at 39644. "
"8463640","8467040"," You're looking to take some calls if we can retest this and not get it thrown right back over."
"8478550","8484410"," Yeah, I agree with the functional with the, I agree with the functional with the, with the asterisk"
"8484410","8484630"," too."
"8488070","8490170"," We do better in that capacity, I think. "
"8491170","8494690"," Like head on with another country."
"8495550","8497770"," No one, we shine."
"8499650","8505470"," You know, Iraq was considered the fourth largest army in the world before we invaded the first"
"8505470","8505790"," time. "
"8507530","8511990"," When we, when they took, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, they were the fourth largest army in the world."
"8512570","8515210"," We ran over them in a matter of days."
"8516850","8519990"," Fourth largest in the world. "
"8520870","8522610"," No small, no, no, no."
"8522730","8524090"," I mean, that does mean something."
"8536770","8538150"," Yeah, it's logistics. "
"8538730","8540370"," Well, that's what we coined."
"8540570","8541970"," It was an acronym that we used and we're there."
"8552520","8556980"," Yeah, like the politics of it, whether it should be like that or shouldn't be like that. "
"8557140","8558600"," I leave that to other people."
"8559460","8561080"," But they were like the reality versus."
"8562280","8566560"," You know, like I can accept arguments for against all that stuff. "
"8566960","8568140"," I understand all those arguments."
"8568440","8571860"," But like what the truth is versus statement says they will."
"8572060","8576340"," Like reality versus arguing whether we should or should. "
"8576340","8579100"," They have deep incorporation and trust between their armed forces."
"8579900","8581760"," Yeah, it reminds me of Afghanistan."
"8582260","8582520"," It's like. "
"8585140","8587620"," There's a whole like, you know, Afghanistan, right?"
"8587780","8588180"," Twenty years."
"8588520","8590020"," Stream is sponsored by Ticksright."
"8590340","8591100"," It's like. "
"8591440","8594900"," You actually hear order flame futures, for X and stock instruments."
"8595120","8596280"," I was I was in."
"8596420","8601620"," We went to Afghanistan and we didn't go to Afghanistan to nation build. "
"8601860","8603820"," We went there to kill people."
"8605120","8605520"," Revenge."
"8606040","8608960"," We went there for revenge and went there for some oil and ship to. "
"8610260","8610920"," In pipelines."
"8614060","8615120"," That kind of stuff."
"8616240","8619220"," But like the whole nation building thing was like, yeah, we're going to. "
"8619520","8622480"," We're going to sell that to the US and we're going to sell that to young soldiers."
"8623300","8624540"," That's why we're still there."
"8624560","8625460"," And of course it failed. "
"8626440","8628640"," And of course we're not good at that stuff either, right?"
"8628760","8629760"," We're not good at nation building."
"8631900","8634880"," You do enough of that nation building ship."
"8635900","8639820"," And you're but your pounds are pissed off enough people that they don't want you there. "
"8639820","8641860"," It's a military political alliance."
"8648490","8650010"," Which were Ukraine."
"8652630","8656870"," The Ukraine war right now is built to not end. "
"8657950","8659030"," It's built to."
"8660930","8662910"," Pin down Russia and hurt a lot of Russians."
"8663870","8665910"," That's what's built for right now in my view. "
"8669230","8671990"," It's built to grind Russia to the dust."
"8673690","8676430"," And if we can do that for five more years, all the better."
"8676730","8678710"," We can do it for like next seven years all the better. "
"8679470","8681930"," If it gives a chance for NATO, the UN."
"8682430","8687610"," I don't like NATO in the UN, but like giving those nations a chance to arm themselves."
"8688950","8692410"," To be able to help us in a defense of Europe against Russia. "
"8693130","8696610"," While we go and fight in Asia with our allies."
"8697090","8698230"," It's not all makes sense."
"8698890","8701490"," It all sounds like something the US would do. "
"8710370","8713950"," Yeah, and they're going to, you know, the one thing I don't know what that back room deal is."
"8714210","8715470"," I don't know if that back room."
"8715890","8716990"," My assumption is. "
"8718150","8722250"," From some of the like old interviews from Ukraine, I think they were they don't have a choice."
"8722250","8727130"," I think in a back room that Ukraine has two choices."
"8727530","8730990"," They become a satellite again of Russia law firm. "
"8731170","8737510"," Some holders of credit Suices 81 bonds seek legal advice office, which is the Swiss decision to"
"8737510","8738410"," wipe out their holdings."
"8739110","8742830"," And they get ground down with a war with the West according to a law firm."
"8742910","8749650"," Some holders of credit Suices 81 bonds seek legal advice after the Swiss decision to wipe out their"
"8749650","8749970"," holdings. "
"8749970","8752270"," Just check this real quick right here."
"8752490","8753830"," I'm going to look at this in a one minute here."
"8754330","8756270"," See if see if bulls can hold this. "
"8765430","8774200"," You know, you have this choice if you Ukraine."
"8775500","8777080"," Nice little squeeze here."
"8777240","8779900"," See if the bulls can hold on to this and get a nice squeeze higher. "
"8782020","8783540"," Nice little reversal so far."
"8783540","8790340"," I want to see I want to see some kind of a come back down and check and some bonuses"
"8790340","8790860"," for credit."
"8791080","8796520"," See if forming right in here. "
"8809970","8814130"," Let's see if we can get a nice nice confirmation that we're going higher."
"8815070","8816930"," You're like Ukraine's like in this weird place."
"8816950","8821050"," It's like, okay, so I can become a satellite of Russia. "
"8821050","8824890"," I already know that Russia has plans to."
"8826130","8829610"," Expand its borders for more buffer to start a war with the West."
"8831430","8836730"," And Ukraine historically is the fighting class for Russia if you didn't know that. "
"8837190","8839690"," So I'm going to have to fight the West as Ukraine."
"8840910","8844090"," For Russia and more than likely a ground dust anyways."
"8844750","8845970"," So if I fight for the West. "
"8848230","8850730"," My chances of winning are better."
"8850930","8854230"," And then my chances of becoming a part of the West are better."
"8854870","8856970"," There's no real win win for Ukraine. "
"8858350","8858530"," It matters."
"8858850","8862850"," The only thing the only thing where Ukraine can really do is say I'm on your side or I'm on"
"8862850","8864730"," your side and I know that either way I lose."
"8866930","8868370"," They're kind of screwed here, right?"
"8870670","8871710"," One way or another. "
"8871710","8876670"," In the U.S. and the West knows that they will provide you with weapons and provide you with"
"8876670","8876930"," training."
"8878610","8880230"," It's more than likely CIA."
"8880730","8886210"," There's more than likely contractor U.S. contractors there that are paid and funded with some kind"
"8886210","8886790"," of dark money. "
"8886950","8887550"," You know it's there."
"8887890","8891810"," If any of you are military watching this stream right now, you know what the fuck is going on."
"8894810","8897930"," And what you do is you grind them down instead of just harassing. "
"8897930","8899870"," We're trying to murder as many as possible."
"8902710","8906730"," Instead of getting the Russians experienced, you just want to kill as many as possible."
"8906990","8908510"," It's terrible to say that, but it's true. "
"8910110","8915170"," Meanwhile Ukraine gets stuck in the middle hoping that tensions are relieved so they can then join"
"8915170","8915510"," the West."
"8916430","8920290"," Or if they go to war, they already know that they at least have the West to their back and"
"8920290","8920810"," not the East."
"8922850","8923650"," It's kind of tragic. "
"8924630","8925170"," It's more than tragic."
"8925570","8927090"," It's disgusting and gross."
"8933130","8938210"," But the reality versus the reality versus what you want it to be two different things, right?"
"8961760","8964060"," And we didn't kill many Russians in Afghanistan. "
"8965800","8967920"," Afghanistan in the 80s, we didn't kill a ton of Russians."
"8969080","8972020"," It was more it was like be a thorn in the side."
"8972440","8973380"," This is different. "
"8973940","8975380"," You can see that it's different."
"8977820","8984140"," I'm watching right here."
"8984140","8985180"," It starts to move higher here. "
"8986420","8989640"," If you're a bully, you'll be looking for price to start to head higher."
"8990360","8991760"," I've got some calls set up here."
"8991780","8994240"," I'm looking at 398 C's if that happens. "
"8995000","8996120"," I haven't bought them yet."
"8996980","8999020"," I'm just looking to see if we get this move higher here."
"9000860","9003140"," We get the confirmation that we're going higher. "
"9005830","9007410"," If not, we start to roll over."
"9007510","9009190"," I'll look at some puts for the put side of this trade."
"9012880","9017100"," It's really bizarre because the Russians didn't lose many, man. "
"9017100","9023740"," If you look at back at what Russians lost in a number of troops, Russia's lost in the Afghanistan"
"9023740","9025280"," pales in comparison."
"9026820","9027600"," Pales in comparison."
"9028140","9032940"," This is an active effort from the West to grind down the Russian military. "
"9040590","9041530"," Yeah, I agree with that."
"9041650","9042790"," It has been trapped by that."
"9067220","9068640"," Have a trade set up right now. "
"9068680","9069400"," Still not in it."
"9069620","9070380"," Looking to take it."
"9078400","9080440"," We're going to five minute real quick just for some confirmation. "
"9088170","9089030"," Right there."
"9096100","9097560"," Got a one minute chart here."
"9100380","9101720"," Didn't get a nice squeeze here. "
"9103840","9106740"," Not seeing price change in the options chain right now."
"9107140","9108360"," Not on 398 at least."
"9109480","9111680"," They're not pricing in this move higher here. "
"9156150","9162410"," Yeah, I don't think, I think, I mean, whether it's like, so when it comes to the nuclear option or"
"9162410","9164450"," the nuclear threat, I think that."
"9167090","9168030"," Right or wrong."
"9171290","9174090"," Whether they are making a poor decision on this or not. "
"9174810","9177490"," There are military planners out there that."
"9177590","9181850"," Thanks to your gathering in Washington for a two day scheduled meeting starting on a Tuesday."
"9182270","9184810"," First Republic will be discussed again, according to sources. "
"9185730","9188050"," That see the escalation coming regardless."
"9189130","9192890"," And know that currently right now that."
"9193470","9197150"," The U.S. has its best chance, even with the threat of nuclear war. "
"9197970","9198270"," Right now."
"9200390","9206790"," And you don't, we don't know what, what the U.S. has in terms of defense."
"9207230","9208530"," We don't know what. "
"9209750","9216230"," We don't know the capabilities of the U.S. Publicly, we think we do a few, you and I as"
"9216230","9217810"," a regular person in the street think we do."
"9217930","9218530"," We really don't."
"9219370","9223950"," We don't know, you know, you start to take out how many misses there are. "
"9224430","9227450"," The defense that we have and then what they can actually launch or not launch."
"9227610","9231610"," As you see reason, Maria says, we're much more demanding than the U.S. colleagues on capital for"
"9231610","9232290"," smaller banks."
"9232610","9234950"," Becomes like winnable in some way. "
"9236330","9238870"," The readiness of these countries wasn't there."
"9243080","9248020"," The readiness of these countries was there in the Cold War, not so much right now, right?"
"9248560","9251580"," So it makes the military plan to think, yeah, we can probably win this."
"9253180","9255300"," And, you know, it doesn't make it right or wrong. "
"9255420","9258000"," It doesn't make it right or like real that we can win that way."
"9258080","9259320"," It could be total devastation."
"9260320","9267480"," But from a war planners perspective, the war like that or the threat of that war is more winnable"
"9267480","9269060"," or to keep it conventional. "
"9270140","9272140"," Development of EMP weapons, all that kind of stuff."
"9274620","9275920"," And satellite technology."
"9276400","9279440"," I mean, some of the stuff that they have that we don't know about is insane. "
"9282170","9284070"," So it doesn't make it right or wrong."
"9284090","9291730"," It's just saying that, you know, or it's saying more along the lines of, is there chances of"
"9291730","9294430"," winning better now or in 10 years or two decades?"
"9296930","9298770"," Or is it better now or in two decades?"
"9305300","9305340"," Right?"
"9305500","9309260"," So longer that you wait, the last year chances are winning that war is."
"9309520","9311520"," So you'll have these planners that think like that. "
"9311520","9330010"," I think you"
"9330010","9333730"," just see, to be honest, from a civilians perspective, I would see."
"9335290","9339610"," When you see all those FEMA, those FEMA bases, I think that's what those are built for is the"
"9339610","9340670"," dispersed city populations."
"9343830","9350270"," So that that war overcame, they probably disperse US cities and try to spread out. "
"9352430","9355530"," The possibility of civilian casualties in the US."
"9366420","9367760"," I think it would be before that, John."
"9368080","9370040"," I think if you start dropping EMPs, we're going to go. "
"9370720","9374280"," I think if you start dropping EMPs, we're talking pre-industrial age."
"9375940","9380900"," If you destroy, like, building transformers is like a decade long process."
"9383060","9385680"," The electrical transformers and stuff like that. "
"9388420","9390080"," And then the installation of them."
"9391940","9393580"," Talking pre-World War One, buddy."
"9396420","9398060"," Try going back like pre-1900. "
"9399360","9400180"," I'm with you."
"9400740","9401380"," I think it's worse."
"9412070","9417670"," We're talking about sending people back to pre-1900. "
"9421120","9421600"," Easily."
"9427250","9428130"," That's right, man."
"9430910","9432050"," The transformers, dude. "
"9432310","9433710"," The transformers are where it's at."
"9435110","9437110"," It's probably the biggest risk, I think."
"9438290","9441230"," Do we have a bunch of transformers in a mine somewhere, salt mine?"
"9444670","9448620"," This is the key right there. "
"9449980","9451520"," Alternators and transformers, right?"
"9457760","9467840"," Yeah, I think it's, you know, like, they're trying to talk it out as a whole other thing, too."
"9468660","9469820"," Eastern, Western culture."
"9471260","9472780"," Different paths and civilization. "
"9476040","9477640"," It's another challenge for us."
"9477800","9480800"," Now that I agree with, trying to talk it out."
"9481400","9509440"," But, yeah, I"
"9509440","9515160"," don't think that my arguments disagree with the Russia seeing Ukraine as an existential threat at"
"9515160","9515320"," all. "
"9516100","9517300"," I don't disagree with that."
"9518060","9519460"," I think all that still fits."
"9520480","9521920"," I think it all still fits. "
"9523660","9529700"," And also Slav, you know, Putin's even has this, you know, thing that he talks about."
"9530140","9533420"," Saying that, uh, Slavs have their own empire, right?"
"9533660","9535840"," You have Western, Eastern, and you have a Slavish empire."
"9545480","9547360"," I think come pick me up, too, Jimmy. "
"9552960","9554880"," I certainly don't want to see this happening."
"9555500","9558400"," If you want to see, if you want to know if this is a bearish cross, this is a bearish"
"9558400","9559000"," cross right here."
"9561540","9564920"," Just waiting for one more rejection above, uh, for a target below. "
"9573300","9574780"," I'm not on any calls right now."
"9575520","9576340"," I was looking at him."
"9604790","9607610"," Break and hold 395, 395, 63. "
"9608330","9612190"," And we'll get a price target and a clear cleanup of all these gaps down below."
"9624130","9625270"," No, no, none of them calls."
"9634700","9635320"," John M."
"9635440","9637140"," Baby, here goes the barrel plane. "
"9637760","9640180"," So I'll just tee off right here."
"9661450","9662950"," So many buckets on poles."
"9664490","9671450"," The thing that's, I think the thing that's the saddest part of all of this is the, there's going to"
"9671450","9677690"," be a generation of young people that have a lot of, I've got two daughters. "
"9678450","9683090"," Uh, and I'm, uh, deathly afraid for them."
"9683910","9691030"," I don't want them to live, uh, like it's the 1950s again, or 60s or 70s or even the 80s."
"9691110","9691770"," This is some extent. "
"9691990","9697350"," When I was a young child, they still did, um, get under your desk drills when I was still okay."
"9697410","9706110"," They still had active, um, they still had active, um, uh, followed shelters and stuff."
"9706290","9708410"," When I was a young, young child, they still had that stuff. "
"9708410","9716830"," I was very, very young, but you don't want to see the threat of, uh, escalation of war."
"9718670","9720610"," You almost kind of, here we go."
"9720810","9721630"," Nice little squeeze here. "
"9722310","9723470"," This is where we're going to see."
"9726110","9728570"," This is the rejection that the bears are looking for right now."
"9728650","9729330"," They break below. "
"9730890","9732950"," Find that rejection and look for move higher, lower."
"9733170","9734350"," We'll see if they get it or not."
"9747820","9748920"," No day trade right now. "
"9758650","9760490"," So I'm saying we can get some shoe calls for tomorrow."
"9760850","9768950"," I think that, uh, if I, what I think about tomorrow is, or today and tomorrow is, uh, if I"
"9768950","9770830"," can get down here, I'd love to buy some calls."
"9771350","9775650"," Uh, I'd love to buy some calls for tomorrow down here. "
"9777450","9781010"," If we can get above right here for a squeeze higher, it takes some calls too."
"9781250","9784070"," But unless we get above here, it can't take, can't, can't take them right now."
"9784550","9786110"," As a matter of fact, it's a good point. "
"9786310","9792830"," I was going to get zero dates, but, uh, probably want some calls for tomorrow instead to get the"
"9792830","9793570"," juice off them."
"9797440","9798720"," They're a little pricey, but."
"9800880","9802160"," Four or fives are cheap. "
"9802380","9804880"," Those are only, uh, what do we have for an applied move tomorrow?"
"9806720","9815940"," Uh, four or two."
"9825220","9827320"," Four or two is in 92 cents right now."
"9828360","9831080"," So I'll look at those instead of zero dates. "
"9832220","9834960"," I'm interested in actually taking four or twos for tomorrow."
"9834960","9836280"," If we can get above right here."
"9838140","9839420"," Get some padding on it. "
"9855280","9863300"," Yeah, we have a transformer, um, uh, shortage in the United States."
"9863300","9864040"," It's a 10 minutes away now."
"9864260","9869740"," So we get the 20 year bond auction to the US selling 12 billion dollars of 20 year bombs with"
"9869740","9871240"," a private cover of two to 54. "
"9871820","9874680"," I mean, per high yield of free spot, nine, seven, seven percent."
"9875420","9878620"," I'm just taking a look at the preview for the auction."
"9878960","9883920"," So JP Morgan strategies noted that the richness of the sector and low risk sentiment sentiment"
"9883920","9889700"," ahead of Wednesday's fed decision along with bank liquidity concerns suggest additional concession. "
"9889700","9896180"," Maybe need for the auction to be digested smoothly and weekly CFTC positioning data through March"
"9896180","9903580"," seven shows speculators were net short 173,000 on future contracts possible source of covering"
"9903580","9903820"," demand."
"9904520","9911180"," Primary dealers positions in coupons maturing in more than 11 years when was net long 45 spot $4"
"9911180","9916960"," billion in the week ended March 8 near 45 billion dollars average over the past year."
"9918800","9920240"," Just garbage in here nothing. "
"9920720","9921200"," No trade."
"9936840","9937660"," Yeah, threads."
"9946090","9946910"," Hey, what's up, Joe?"
"9947090","9947690"," I see you in here, man. "
"9948130","9948570"," How are you doing?"
"9958990","9962290"," Yeah, I'm not even concerned with semiconductors as much as I am with transformers."
"9963110","9965170"," No need for no need for semiconductors."
"9966470","9968670"," If you don't have some if you don't have transformers. "
"9970730","9972150"," Getting ahead of ourselves here."
"9980430","9981050"," Oh, yeah."
"9981910","9982970"," Oh, baby. "
"9984250","9985370"," Come on now."

"9998280","9999380"," Only twenty five cents."
"10004730","10006910"," He's twenty five cents to trade now right now. "
"10017950","10018660"," I'm liking that."
"10020600","10021820"," I'm liking this a lot."
"10028500","10029720"," Let me get some of them calls. "
"10036110","10037950"," I mean that squeeze, baby."
"10040790","10042070"," I mean that squeeze."
"10045350","10047750"," Three ninety eights trading twenty five cents. "
"10052680","10053740"," We can get this thing."
"10053880","10055860"," Let's see if we can get three ninety eights to print."
"10058320","10058960"," Come on. "
"10060480","10061320"," Come on."

"10086110","10086630"," Squeeze it hard."
"10086770","10087970"," Not trading twenty seven cents."
"10089510","10090750"," Keep on squeezing. "
"10094310","10095590"," Keep squeezing."
"10098470","10099610"," Give me a retest."
"10099830","10100530"," Give me a retest. "
"10100730","10101010"," They're successful."
"10103570","10104790"," Keep on squeezing."
"10106630","10107610"," Squeeze it up. "
"10108390","10111790"," Keep on squeezing it up."
"10113290","10115150"," Trading twenty seven cents right now."
"10120580","10121400"," Come on. "

"10141810","10142450"," Twenty four cents."
"10145710","10146770"," Twenty three cents. "

"10181520","10183920"," The US selling twelve billion dollars of twenty year bombs. "
"10184560","10189580"," We were private cover of two to fifty four and a prior high yield of free spot nine seven percent."
"10193660","10194660"," You're doing well, Joe."
"10208820","10210800"," Yeah, I think we went over Tesla earlier, Joe. "
"10220500","10221260"," You're going to."
"10222140","10224740"," You probably already have access to Tesla here, right?"
"10225300","10225560"," There's squeeze."
"10228820","10229620"," Come on. "
"10229860","10231200"," Squeeze the spy, baby."
"10238790","10239730"," You have a cold."
"10240610","10242410"," I thought I might have had COVID. "
"10243650","10246430"," I took two COVID tests."
"10247990","10248810"," Both were negative."
"10249230","10250350"," I should probably take one on the stream. "
"10251290","10252510"," Should I take a COVID test here?"
"10255290","10256770"," See if I actually have it or not?"
"10257330","10258170"," Taking two tests now."
"10258390","10259070"," Let me see if I have one here."
"10259210","10259410"," Hold on. "
"10270270","10270790"," I do."
"10271050","10272630"," I have an extra one right here."
"10275740","10277540"," I've got a, I don't know if this is a good one. "
"10277720","10279340"," I've got a bunch of my boxes everywhere."
"10280440","10281600"," I've got this one right here."
"10281600","10282140"," What is that?"
"10282780","10284640"," Fine acts now. "
"10287760","10290060"," I think this is two tests or maybe I might have already you."
"10290140","10291260"," Nope, I haven't used this one yet."
"10293340","10294260"," You can take another one. "
"10294340","10296180"," I have to take them every like two, three days just to make sure."
"10296920","10300480"," I want to make sure that my throat wasn't COVID."
"10307160","10309660"," Yeah, I'm looking for, I've got some calls right now. "
"10310520","10312980"," I'm sitting in three ninety eight C's."
"10329550","10332810"," See, I'll take one of these, I'll take one of these COVID tests right now in front of you guys."
"10333910","10335710"," Let's see if it comes back negative or positive. "
"10339170","10339910"," Hold on here."
"10340470","10341290"," These things are gross."
"10344710","10350530"," It's weird though, when they do it to you when you travel, they're not as, I think I get up,"
"10351030","10352670"," I get deeper inside my nostril. "
"10357120","10358540"," Then they do, but they do more."
"10358700","10359540"," They make more pain."
"10362750","10368470"," They give me, they give me more pain than, uh, I think it'll be able to get deeper up into"

"10848490","10850750"," I haven't actually I had one or two moments."
"10852530","10856230"," I've had two moments where I kind of felt sick or run down."
"10856850","10859310"," Since the start of COVID, but I haven't had it. "
"10861630","10863150"," And I've been vaccinated."
"10864510","10866870"," In large groups of people I bask up."
"10868830","10871810"," If I go anywhere with these large groups of people, I do mask up still. "
"10872470","10873870"," But I haven't always messed up."
"10873950","10875750"," If I go out to eat and stuff like that, I don't."
"10879500","10883200"," It's like I'm like probably like a max bag, right?"
"10883540","10889180"," Like I don't I don't mask up necessarily to not catch COVID, but I don't want people catching my"
"10889180","10889480"," ship. "
"10889900","10894280"," Like if I've got germs or if I had strep and didn't know that kind of stuff, I kind of"
"10894280","10897700"," don't mind wearing masks, especially in places where."
"10900580","10904400"," Like I think like wearing a mask isn't the worst thing in the world and it's not COVID."
"10904680","10907000"," It's not like the whole like should I mask or not mask anything. "
"10907620","10909300"," Plus it keeps my face warm in the winter."
"10909520","10916800"," Now I don't know how I'm going to feel this summer wearing a mask around people, but I haven't"
"10916800","10917860"," gotten sick that I know of."
"10917960","10918900"," Like I mean like nothing. "
"10919520","10920300"," No streps throughout."
"10920600","10920960"," No flu."
"10921440","10922680"," No like I mean nothing. "
"10924880","10926600"," Not a thing since I've done that."
"10926780","10936500"," So like I guess like this general idea of not trying to spread"
"10936500","10937340"," germs to their people."
"10937340","10939580"," I don't know if that's keeping germs away from me as well. "
"10941260","10945900"," But the first time I usually get sick and I got kids too like they get a lot of friends."
"10947600","10952780"," And so I haven't gotten sick surprisingly past what is that now three years."
"10953640","10957780"," At least they haven't gotten a normally I'll get sick at least once or twice a season. "
"10960260","10961540"," They haven't gotten sick."
"10967630","10970970"," Yeah like that the allergies is helped with a ton."
"10972330","10976490"," It's this weird thing where I'm like I get the idea of I don't want to be forced to mask"
"10976490","10976850"," anymore. "
"10976990","10977810"," I get it."
"10979990","10981610"," I understand it flipped it up."
"10981770","10985330"," But I'm like hey this this actually isn't too bad like he's a face warm in the winter. "
"10986090","10987730"," I'm like I'm not getting sick."
"10989590","10991790"," I'm not spreading germs to other people."
"10995720","10997480"," But I'm not a hundred percent. "
"10997940","11000900"," So I'm most certainly not like I'm still going out to eat."
"11000940","11001980"," I'm still going out here."
"11002040","11003100"," I'm still going out there. "
"11003480","11004520"," Still around people."
"11006200","11011560"," Like if I go to like the Home Depot or if I go grocery shopping or something it's packed mask."
"11013560","11019040"," If I go to like an event with like I just went to an event with a bunch of people"
"11019040","11023240"," were there right in this like a glass or it was like a plastic dome or something. "
"11024940","11026780"," And I was packed full of people."
"11028540","11030460"," And I wore a mask in there."
"11031180","11034260"," Matter of fact I was like lifting my mask up to drink whiskey. "
"11034700","11035440"," People were looking at me."
"11036200","11036920"," I was like yeah fuck you."
"11037700","11038180"," Whatever. "
"11039220","11040440"," You do you and I'll do me."

"12422380","12423060"," It's pretty good, right?"
"12424120","12425360"," Got another one above."
"12426680","12427780"," Might not even wait."
"12427940","12429100"," Just start smashing through. "
"12436320","12439400"," Now that's whatever that whatever that shit that I put up my nose."
"12440600","12443740"," Remember that shit that thing that I stuck up my nose a half an hour ago."
"12443840","12444720"," That big long stick. "
"12445400","12446620"," It's making my boogers run."
"12449520","12451120"," I'm like snorting boogers."
"12456190","12457730"," Trading 39721 right now. "
"12458190","12461250"," Now those calls that I got out of there back to 79 cents."
"12461990","12464110"," They might just blast off and might go there."
"12464190","12465750"," We got them one more place to look at. "
"12465870","12470840"," Remember this right here."
"12471300","12473240"," So this is another little H line above."
"12473520","12474600"," This is where shorts were prior. "
"12476060","12478720"," I'm going to show them where you were right here right above right here."
"12479100","12480940"," So you could get one more little squeeze out here."
"12481600","12483140"," Nice little squeeze above here. "
"12483660","12485140"," Try to turn this into some support."
"12485840","12486640"," Make our way higher."
"12489050","12492170"," And we got a couple of other places to look at above here we got. "
"12493170","12496430"," Oh, this little T and off spot spot way up there."
"12497610","12499410"," Couple other places we look on the market."
"12510940","12512400"," Just kill the VIX man. "
"12512980","12514420"," Just murder the VIX."
"12527650","12529010"," Maybe that helps right there."
"12529150","12529470"," Does that help?"
"12530530","12531650"," There we go right there. "
"12531730","12531970"," That helps."
"12536290","12539550"," Got some places showing themselves now to us."
"12539550","12542490"," We have some bars above. "
"12543350","12544430"," Some targets there."

"12556570","12558090"," 397 is now trading 80 cents. "
"12558750","12559870"," I'm not long these anymore."
"12560790","12562650"," I'm looking to get long on them again if I can."
"12563130","12565470"," I hope I don't get left behind here. "
"12566470","12567030"," But I'm happy."
"12572630","12574630"," You have a big long stick."
"12581650","12583230"," You know, I'm like open to it. "
"12583250","12584290"," If I get COVID, I get COVID."
"12584390","12585310"," I don't have COVID yet."
"12586670","12587990"," I'm still waiting to get you. "
"12588110","12589730"," I'm assuming I thought about it the other day."
"12589890","12590250"," I was like."
"12591350","12592430"," I thought about the other day. "
"12592510","12594330"," I was like, whenever I do come down with COVID."
"12595830","12597730"," I might probably get knocked the fuck out."
"12597870","12599650"," Everyone that I know has been knocked out by it. "
"12599890","12602090"," Not everybody, but most people that have known."
"12602090","12605590"," Having said like it was easy."
"12607590","12609650"," Most people that have known they've gotten knocked out. "
"12611970","12613290"," Pretty severely at the minimum."
"12613550","12614990"," And I know people that have died from it too."
"12615350","12617430"," These are older people, but very healthy older people. "
"12618110","12619710"," They've died from COVID."
"12620830","12621690"," Squeezing higher now."
"12621770","12622250"," Not even waiting. "
"12622550","12624530"," Just trading 397 37."
"12624990","12625710"," Does it go all the way?"
"12625850","12633670"," Does 397 actually do 397 kind of print that $1.40. Trading 397 35 right now."
"12634950","12636990"," Trading 85 cents on those calls. "
"12638610","12640850"," Big squeezes ahead for us right here."
"12642110","12647590"," Let me look on Spy real quick and see why I had that red bar above."
"12649190","12651030"," Oh, yeah, we're really bullish here. "
"12651710","12653330"," Actually, going long again."
"12658080","12659120"," Just a second here."
"12667180","12672800"," We have on Spy 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 trigger combination here. "
"12673220","12677000"," If you are a bear here, just be really careful of a major squeeze taking place in the background."
"12677800","12678980"," You may not see it."
"12679080","12681640"," We may like uncontrollably squeeze here. "
"12682700","12684320"," Now if we do get a pullback."
"12686780","12687260"," 39420."
"12689520","12690520"," See something here. "
"12695600","12697400"," 39420 is down here now."
"12697400","12706560"," All of this is now all these out all these all these all this is just pushing and squeezing higher."
"12709470","12711470"," Could be a market squeeze in the making. "
"12713170","12716690"," I'll show it to you on a different chart here so you can see what I'm talking about."
"12719010","12720930"," Someone's going to get squeezed probably tech."
"12722230","12724010"," So we're going to watch this right here. "
"12724010","12727390"," I want you to see."
"12728550","12730750"," I want you to see something here."
"12731010","12735630"," So I want you to see this cluster right here right where my cursor is and this hourly moving up"
"12735630","12736250"," higher here. "
"12737550","12742690"," This hourly starts coming up higher and all this stuff gets underneath and price stays above here."
"12743610","12750390"," In previous examples, it gets really I want to call it emotional."
"12754010","12756010"," I see they show you a prior example of this. "
"12757870","12759350"," We had everything together."
"12763830","12764710"," Everything together."
"12765310","12766230"," It's been a long time. "
"12767550","12768290"," See me bring."
"12769830","12771550"," It's been a long long time."
"12771650","12773210"," We're going back into the 2020s here. "
"12774310","12777390"," Yeah, I can't show it on this chart that make a larger chart for you."
"12778630","12781250"," Now, but I do want you to know that they get violence."
"12781610","12782550"," Here's a good example right here. "
"12783630","12785270"," This is a good good close example."
"12786730","12787390"," I want you to see."
"12788250","12790730"," I believe this is, yeah, back in December 13th. "
"12791490","12793150"," A violent squeeze higher here."
"12795530","12799110"," And we're coming into that same time period right now."
"12799150","12800230"," And I want you to be aware of it. "
"12801730","12803710"," This can become a very, very."
"12805870","12806910"," Very violent."
"12809490","12810430"," So hang on. "
"12810810","12811410"," Hang on tight."
"12811970","12813490"," Even if there's a rejection here."
"12814290","12816170"," Even if you come up here and there's a rejection. "
"12817150","12819870"," You're talking about the ability for the market to squeeze."
"12821250","12821730"," Unrelentlessly."
"12822570","12823050"," Higher. "
"12829050","12831650"," And that green, that green line is right here."
"12832210","12833210"," That's this one right here."
"12834150","12834870"," I'm showing you. "
"12836550","12839190"," You could see a violent, violent move up higher here."
"12850640","12852360"," And sellers do not want to give this up."
"12852520","12853880"," If sellers give this up here. "
"12854780","12856180"," Even if it's just time based."
"12856180","12858300"," If we start doing this nonsense here."
"12858460","12861740"," This comes up, comes up over the next three, four hours. "
"12861920","12862580"," Anything like that."
"12867780","12875600"," 94.03. In the second hand, let me check the."
"12881090","12890940"," 94.05. Right"
"12890940","12891560"," down here. "
"12892480","12893780"," Even though it's right here."
"12896320","12897700"," Even though it's right here."
"12897700","12899780"," This, this is moving up. "
"12899920","12901740"," It's just like climbing, climbing, climbing."
"12902920","12904660"," And it's pushing the market higher."
"12923300","12933300"," 396.75. 396.75. Right down here. "
"12941580","12943940"," I guess we could have left this up here and move this up."
"12945040","12946060"," Make that yellow again."
"12947340","12949260"," So this was, this is where it was early, right?"
"12950420","12951180"," This right here. "
"12951480","12985050"," 96.75. See"
"12985050","12987190"," what somebody you're saying with this squeeze potential here."
"12988430","12999830"," I'll show"
"12999830","13000530"," it to you right now."
"13004280","13006000"," I'm going to show it to you in the VIX two. "
"13013780","13014620"," It's right here."
"13018280","13020080"," Huge, huge, violent squeezing."
"13021780","13023380"," Now you don't want to get trapped here. "
"13023460","13025100"," I'm assuming a bear is going to tell you."
"13025200","13026240"," You're going to get trapped in here."
"13028320","13030280"," The VIX, let's do the VIX real quick. "
"13032560","13033720"," It's a 30 minute chart."
"13036040","13037300"," It's like on the one minute chart."
"13038440","13039680"," So you can see it too. "
"13039820","13041000"," It's a one minute chart on the spy."
"13046030","13047510"," It's right as beautiful right here."
"13048310","13048750"," Gorgeous. "
"13050290","13052390"," hourly is just racing up to meet it right now."
"13053410","13056130"," Bam, bam, bam, bam."
"13057710","13059790"," It's like 1,604 o'clock. "
"13060950","13066330"," It would be interesting to see if we trade sideways in this four o'clock hour for a squeeze"
"13066330","13066970"," overnight."
"13068750","13070830"," Or if they try to trap the bulls the way down."
"13071290","13074050"," Now you have VIXpiration, right?"
"13074390","13074570"," Coming up. "
"13075550","13076170"," You got VIX."
"13086680","13096350"," You want to see the VIX stay below 22 and ultimately"
"13096350","13097910"," below 2,162."
"13098610","13099530"," On the VIX. "
"13108580","13111480"," So two targets for VIX for you to watch for your bear."
"13112860","13124130"," 23.62 and then 21.52. Yeah,"
"13124510","13126330"," the squeezing here could be violent."
"13127290","13128210"," Absolutely violent. "
"13131710","13134070"," I guess if you're a bear the rollover."
"13134350","13137110"," I guess you're thinking about the rollover over here into tomorrow."
"13137790","13140050"," Four PM will be an interesting time today. "
"13140570","13142010"," Let's see where they leave us at four."
"13146330","13147470"," It might be nice."
"13148110","13152650"," It might be interested in a strangle on the close here. "
"13153590","13155090"," They're paying where they leave us."
"13170180","13172420"," VIX just cratering right now."
"13172640","13175480"," Now trading 2141 on the VIX. "
"13176200","13177280"," VIX getting bloodbath."
"13188780","13191140"," Trading 2141 right now VIX."
"13225190","13228430"," Yeah, there's a giant squeeze happening right here. "
"13229510","13233530"," You don't see it in spy, but there is a massive squeeze taking place."
"13238450","13240230"," And a lot of velocity to the upside."
"13255260","13257420"," NVIDIA squeezing higher right now. "
"13257880","13259160"," Tesla squeezing higher."
"13267330","13268490"," Apple squeezing higher now."
"13270350","13272110"," Apple market squeezing. "
"13277800","13279680"," Google's squeezing like crazy too right now."
"13281940","13283480"," VIX now trading 2134."
"13290060","13291260"," It's going to be kind of wild. "
"13291480","13295080"," I'm kind of thinking about whenever that hedge comes off spy."
"13296640","13299600"," It is a go up 100 fucking points in a day."
"13303910","13306090"," Whenever the hedge comes off the market. "
"13307390","13308930"," It's going to be fucking stupid."
"13320970","13330090"," I wouldn't be surprised if someone was asking about if they did a pause or a rate cut."
"13330470","13333650"," We'd probably squeeze the fucking moon in like five minutes. "
"13335470","13336270"," It would be wild."
"13342690","13344310"," Joe Harper saying gross."
"13344310","13348930"," Yeah, you can see they're not shorting them. "
"13349070","13351310"," They're not shorting individual tickers."
"13351310","13352510"," They're getting run over right now."
"13352670","13354750"," Apple's just running people over right now. "
"13371010","13374050"," Do I think we're seeing some hedging coming up right now?"
"13374110","13375230"," No, I think that."
"13377250","13382530"," So I don't even think we know that the market is hedged via spy and not via individual tickers."
"13383270","13386970"," So you're like long tickers and individual tickers. "
"13386970","13388890"," And you're shorting the index is so cheap."
"13389990","13392170"," But if any good news comes around at any moment."
"13392710","13396970"," There should be just, you know, crazy squeezing just like we saw earlier in the week. "
"13419060","13421000"," Yeah, if there is a pause."
"13422040","13425960"," You probably see for 3460 easily."
"13427060","13428760"," It could happen like a day or three days. "
"13428760","13432160"," I mean, that's how that's how crazy the shorts are in this market."
"13432160","13435380"," It's insane, but not the market, but the spy itself."
"13437080","13440560"," You know, you probably see a probably see a squeeze to tomorrow. "
"13440600","13446200"," You probably see a squeeze to at least four or five, if not higher by Friday."
"13446440","13451800"," You might see like four or two get tagged, come back and then a much larger move higher."
"13454300","13455140"," It would be violent. "
"13459960","13460620"," I don't know."
"13460740","13461520"," I don't know."
"13461520","13463280"," I'm trying to don't know. "
"13463380","13465880"," I'm trying to figure out the like the hedging on the market."
"13465880","13466660"," It's all through spy."
"13469850","13471850"," So I've had the potential of getting run over. "
"13473050","13474630"," It could blast off."
"13480250","13480730"," Yeah."
"13481070","13483510"," Omar is saying a $14 move up from two to four PM. "
"13483710","13485050"," We've seen those days too, right?"
"13486170","13489990"," There's been a few days in the past year where hedges did come off the market."
"13492090","13495770"," And those days where it did, we went up three percent in four hours."
"13496190","13497870"," Four percent of those three and a half percent. "
"13498530","13499230"," Something like that."
"13501370","13502950"," It was like three or four hours long."
"13503430","13504330"," It was just straight up. "
"13526250","13528570"," It makes me want to buy calls every day right here."
"13535600","13537080"," I just hold them in the clothes today."
"13537340","13538260"," Tomorrow doesn't really matter. "
"13540380","13543100"," The moment they lift their finger, it's just going to go to the fucking moon."
"13554860","13560640"," I'm missing some, uh, missing some, some tweets here."
"13561580","13601770"," I love it. "
"13601890","13606590"," First Republic will be discussed by major banks, CEOs gathered in Washington for a two day"
"13606590","13608070"," scheduled meeting, beginning Tuesday."
"13609330","13613450"," Sources, ECB's, uh, Enria on capital for smaller banks."
"13614190","13616730"," They're much more demanding than our colleagues in the United States. "
"13619550","13624790"," If the capital raise fails, first Republic Bank is considering downsizing options."
"13631370","13632810"," You got to love this shit."
"13633390","13639030"," I mean, I'm reading some of this stuff in the background here about regional banks and banks that"
"13639030","13640870"," are taking on a scene risk. "
"13643460","13644440"," We're not even tired."
"13644620","13645380"," We're not even in the discussion."
"13645660","13648040"," I love how the ball moves to the ball moves on. "
"13648940","13650240"," The ball moves on."
"13650600","13654760"," Well, they took these bonds because, you know, rates, they didn't have a choice."
"13656420","13657940"," I'm like, this is bullshit. "
"13659880","13663280"," 35% exposure or no 70."
"13663580","13669280"," Would you call it 65% exposure to 35% long bonds?"
"13670260","13671140"," Yeah, no."
"13672140","13673040"," No, no, no. "
"13674620","13676000"," And then not adding bond."
"13676140","13679320"," The other crazy part too is they didn't add bonds as rates went up."
"13681200","13683540"," So I got the guy had nothing for these banks. "
"13685940","13687340"," I'm trying to sell right now."
"13688380","13690320"," They're just trying to roll this over here."
"13690860","13691980"," Trying to get this under. "
"13692180","13693560"," I don't think that it matters much though."
"13693660","13697920"," I don't think that if they get this role here, it's not really too big of a deal."
"13698700","13701360"," If we do get a role here, I don't think it really matters. "
"13701620","13708600"," I think that anything down here is nothing but a bull buy down here."
"13708600","13710760"," The market is extremely supportive in here."
"13711480","13714920"," And then also an awesome buy down below. "
"13716780","13718720"," So I'm not buying any of this right now from the Bears."
"13733280","13734660"," Although it would be epic, right?"
"13735200","13736540"," Bears can get underneath here."
"13737180","13740520"," The Bears can get underneath and then get down here and try to get underneath. "
"13741620","13747220"," I guess this is a nice target for Bears down here, but in truth, Bears need to get underneath."
"13747920","13749840"," I think that it's moved now, right?"
"13752260","13752740"," 39403."
"13754780","13755860"," Yes, we had this. "
"13756220","13757680"," This is actually higher now too."
"13762920","13764720"," This is not your key level for the Bears."
"13765880","13768060"," So we're getting this nice coiling in the market. "
"13769260","13771280"," Bears now don't have to get down that low."
"13771560","13773700"," Bears actually only have to get lower below here."
"13775320","13776320"," That would be Bear Town. "
"13808280","13811320"," Any YouTube finance streamers following us?"
"13811440","13815180"," We're building a toolkit for streamers to have their headlines and their streams need testers."
"13816220","13818140"," Comment DMS. Where did you see that?"
"13821260","13823440"," Should I say something because I stream?"
"13823940","13825920"," As a matter of fact, I didn't stream it this morning, did I?"
"13827160","13829660"," I should show that I actually do stream there. "
"13831300","13832980"," Should I say something to them?"
"13833300","13833820"," Hold on here."
"13834880","13836540"," Let me do something here."
"13837680","13839200"," I don't have it up right now. "
"13842040","13843280"," There it is right there."
"13843400","13844020"," I've got them up."
"13847220","13848080"," Actually do. "
"13849000","13850380"," Uh oh, action required."
"13851500","13854680"," Your SF feed trial has expired."
"13855040","13855440"," Oh shit. "

"13872420","13876160"," Looks like I got a sign up for something here."

"13890950","13892010"," It was expired. "
"13894030","13894550"," Okay."
"13894550","13895470"," So how do I sign up?"

"14017300","14018800"," Like suspect of this."
"14019080","14019840"," Maybe I should contact."
"14021760","14024020"," Okay, so the the ad should be gone. "
"14027600","14029960"," Let's see if that yellow thing keeps coming up."

"14119220","14120640"," This thing is free. "
"14121340","14126240"," Now the updating of data is not."
"14128580","14129540"," Does it make sense?"
"14129860","14131140"," Like the actual feeds in there."
"14132580","14133680"," Are not free. "
"14133840","14135920"," And then the, and then they don't update."

"14197200","14199840"," This is the monthly down here. "
"14200100","14200980"," Maybe to make this blue."
"14206730","14207250"," That's cool."
"14207330","14208190"," We haven't done that color before. "
"14209530","14210570"," This one should be orange."
"14215120","14215720"," That orange?"
"14216000","14216420"," Yeah, that's orange."
"14217440","14218500"," This is the monthly. "
"14218760","14219320"," This is the weekly."
"14220100","14221740"," And this is the daily right here."
"14223780","14225000"," This right here is the daily. "
"14225780","14226720"," Like this one yellow."
"14230090","14231150"," That one red."
"14239770","14241230"," And then the green one down below. "
"14241490","14242530"," This is the hourly right here."
"14243750","14245910"," Maybe I should do the colors with the triggers every day."
"14246930","14247490"," On the boxes. "
"14251670","14252770"," This is bear town."
"14252950","14253450"," But down here."
"14256350","14257350"," You bear town. "
"14266530","14268370"," Yeah, we're down there bear town."
"14270410","14271390"," Maybe that's better."
"14274430","14275890"," Key level right here. "
"14287990","14288770"," This is the weekly."
"14289330","14289950"," This is the monthly."
"14290790","14292150"," Maybe I should be doing it like this. "
"14294350","14295290"," This is the daily."
"14296950","14298850"," I mean, this is better every day."
"14299890","14301370"," I'll show you guys where these are every day. "
"14301690","14304490"," Maybe I'll just start opening the show with where these things are."
"14305730","14306390"," Daily weekly."
"14313010","14313930"," Yeah, I like that. "
"14316790","14317750"," And monthly."
"14326470","14327370"," Maybe that helps."
"14332530","14333530"," Something like that. "
"14340380","14341460"," Yeah, there's a."
"14343340","14344360"," So you've got like."
"14344620","14345380"," So I've got the scroll."
"14345560","14346560"," The ticker scroll, right?"
"14347200","14347540"," And then. "
"14349700","14350580"," To pay."
"14350840","14353220"," So I pull feeds from now."
"14353360","14356400"," What's cool about this pain for this is that I can add feeds to it. "
"14357080","14358660"," From specific accounts."
"14360220","14362580"," So let's say you have an account on Twitter that."
"14363800","14366980"," Only posts long short long short long short. "
"14367500","14368920"," I can add their Twitter feed."
"14369600","14370840"," To this scroller."
"14371460","14374160"," And only when they post would that come up in the scroller. "
"14375540","14377880"," So right now I've got news feeds from Twitter."
"14378460","14382860"," Now the problem here is that a lot of this stuff only updates every 15 minutes."
"14383600","14386600"," So I should probably look so I paid for it right now. "
"14386800","14391520"," What I'll do is after cash market today as a look to find out if there's an RSS feed that"
"14391520","14392140"," I can pay for."
"14392500","14397480"," That's like a one minute update on specific accounts or a real time updating."
"14398180","14400380"," I'm assuming every minute or so I can get a feed. "
"14401440","14403900"," This is all the stuff that Elon talks about, right?"
"14404180","14405740"," Like pain for pain for this stuff."
"14406660","14407520"," Where it used to be free."
"14408800","14410380"," Like Twitter fall used to be instant. "
"14413160","14416920"," You could get like a 30 second or a one minute update on this stuff."
"14417080","14418860"," Real time updates if you want it on Twitter fall."
"14419640","14421000"," So all this stuff is changing. "
"14421980","14425720"," Now going back to financial juice."
"14426440","14428520"," Should I send them a an email?"
"14428780","14429620"," I guess I should send them a."
"14430340","14431980"," Maybe I should email them, right?"
"14432200","14433800"," Is that what they said email financial juice?"

"14493460","14494280"," DB Sigma."
"14495220","14497160"," Do you mind posting?"
"14497900","14503660"," Do you mind posting something to them and just saying say, Hey, Captain James loves financial"
"14503660","14504140"," juice."

"14594600","14595640"," It doesn't say pay anymore. "
"14596500","14598600"," You would see that yellow thing that says pay."
"14613590","14614330"," Oh, wait a minute."

"14976150","14979290"," You know what they have like book map has reached out. "
"14979690","14981790"," I think trend spiders reached out."
"14982350","14984710"," I still haven't contacted all those guys."
"14985030","14986450"," I should and I haven't done that. "
"14988010","14992910"," So I guess I need to I need to contact all these folks because I do like using them."

"15022920","15026460"," We only have 259 concurrent viewers right now, but normally we have."
"15027120","15031500"," 400 or 500 on YouTube and then we've got at least usually 200 on Twitch. "
"15033460","15036080"," So probably because of the stream yesterday, if I had to guess."
"15041720","15044520"," I think it was trend was either trend spider or another one."
"15044700","15045480"," I don't know. "
"15045640","15046100"," Do this today."

"15051760","15056020"," They contacted me once or twice before I wanted to do something, but then I got too busy with the"
"15056020","15056280"," website."
"15056860","15059120"," But for right now, it might as well."
"15060240","15060940"," You know, it's funny. "
"15061080","15061520"," I was looking at."
"15061960","15067460"," I was looking at the book like the books and I think I made like $1.50 or something."
"15069560","15070500"," Which is kind of funny. "
"15071220","15071920"," I'll have to show you guys."
"15072360","15075160"," I'll have to show you guys the figures on that stuff."

"15080200","15081420"," Are you guys are all short here?"
"15081500","15081980"," Is that what you are?"
"15082380","15082840"," Oh, no."
"15093130","15094510"," Yeah, you know, maybe I can have Joe."
"15094710","15096370"," Maybe Joe has some time to help with these. "
"15096370","15097990"," Maybe I just poured all of these requests."
"15099350","15101610"," So Joe, I just want you to know that I have like."
"15102470","15103570"," For months now. "
"15105270","15108790"," They've had a potential sponsors that have reached out."
"15111170","15113110"," Maybe I'll just talk to Joe about it."
"15113410","15114410"," See if Joe can help out. "
"15117820","15118540"," I've got a."
"15118660","15121440"," Oh, yeah, big ass 86 big bass 86."
"15124100","15126440"," I already showed you the high and lows for tomorrow and spy."
"15126440","15128000"," I'll show them to you again right now. "
"15129440","15135540"," Make sure you're tuning in first thing in the morning, but I will show you right now."
"15136460","15137820"," So on the five day here."
"15138600","15140760"," It's not really thinking about the implied move. "
"15140920","15142640"," It is what the implied move is for tomorrow."
"15143420","15144880"," Take a screenshot of this."
"15144880","15146000"," If you're just joining us. "
"15149360","15151200"," Here is your implied move for tomorrow."
"15151600","15152460"," It's right up here."
"15153500","15154880"," And down here right here. "
"15155540","15156720"," You're going to expect tomorrow."
"15157500","15160140"," At least the first you expect at least."
"15161960","15166760"," You know, if we get a squeeze higher for for it to fail and for this to fail. "
"15167580","15168920"," You won't actually hit it."
"15169080","15172080"," They won't actually go into money typically in your first rip higher or lower."
"15172940","15176060"," There is the market is very supportive right now. "
"15176060","15176420"," So."
"15178400","15180180"," Just so you can see this right here."
"15180180","15180760"," We've got the daily. "
"15181220","15182780"," Here's your daily trend right here."
"15184560","15185860"," This is your monthly trend."
"15186180","15187880"," This is your hourly trend. "
"15188660","15190220"," The market is very supportive here."
"15190400","15191320"," And what do bears want?"
"15191440","15194120"," They want to get underneath this and get underneath this."
"15194720","15195880"," To take this market lower. "
"15196280","15198340"," If you look at the market as a whole right now."
"15198680","15201060"," The bears have more work to do than the bulls."
"15202580","15204740"," It's not the other way around it right here. "
"15204840","15205220"," The bulls."
"15205380","15206720"," The bears have a ton of work to do."
"15206840","15207700"," They need to break through. "
"15208040","15209600"," This is all supportive right here."
"15209600","15211620"," Whether you whether you agree with this or not."
"15211980","15214440"," We're in a supportive environment for the bulls currently. "
"15214800","15216200"," You can look on an hourly a daily."
"15217180","15218840"," Fifteen minute chart a five minute chart."
"15219340","15221620"," All this work the bulls have done to get up here. "
"15222380","15223360"," Brings up that question."
"15223580","15225020"," If we're getting up here to go higher."
"15226000","15229360"," Then what where is it is a 430 is it for 10 is it four or five. "
"15229820","15231620"," Those are all big questions here."
"15232020","15234580"," I know that if you look at a chart of like apple on the year."
"15235160","15237460"," This is the place where bears send it to the depths of hell. "
"15237840","15239600"," I can see that on a regular chart."
"15240060","15240680"," I want you to know."
"15240860","15241800"," I want you to see something here. "
"15241860","15242720"," I want to show you guys some."
"15243900","15246280"," A difference right now in the market okay."
"15247640","15249380"," So I'm going to show you something real quick. "
"15249600","15250200"," So apple."
"15253730","15255370"," It's like a one year chart on apple."
"15255510","15257350"," And then we're going to look at a different chart now. "
"15257430","15258430"," But we need to see this right here."
"15259670","15261250"," This is the no landing scenario."
"15261890","15263850"," So just look at apple here. "
"15264910","15267510"," Just just be like if you're just like, Hey, I'm looking at a chart right now."
"15267510","15269750"," And I hate these fucking lines right here."
"15269870","15272370"," But if you're looking at this line right here, you're going to say to yourself. "
"15273010","15275010"," Well, we sold the fuck out of this."
"15275130","15276330"," We sold the fuck out of that."
"15276410","15277630"," We sold the fuck out of that. "
"15277710","15280030"," We should sell the fuck out of this."
"15281210","15281870"," We should."
"15282350","15285690"," And I mean, I got to take a crash put on right now. "
"15285750","15287290"," I got to fucking load it to the tits."
"15287870","15290570"," Tumbled and stocks pushed higher with a rally."
"15290750","15297110"," So I had ratios, but now I'm sitting in just the put side to roll this over. "
"15297110","15299770"," And that's like your base case for a bear."
"15300570","15302170"," That's what a bear has to say here."
"15302710","15306770"," But I want to show you something else here that you're not seeing underneath the surface of the"
"15306770","15306890"," mark. "
"15307210","15311610"," I'm going to show you apple here."
"15316850","15324770"," And the stark difference in what apple looks like over the course of a year."
"15330850","15333530"," And there is a difference in what apple looks like. "
"15342500","15347840"," And I want you to see this difference in apple."
"15348300","15351940"," And in apple here, apple broke below."
"15352140","15352460"," It's hourly. "
"15353420","15354180"," It's daily."
"15355260","15358580"," And it's smashed below camp higher and it just started smashing through down here."
"15359240","15362860"," And it got caught by its monthly, right?"
"15363140","15366420"," It's traded higher again, sold back down again, sold back down again. "
"15367000","15370820"," But at this point, price is trading above all these things."
"15370820","15374540"," And I want you to see the difference here."
"15374660","15376640"," I want you to see this yellow line coming up. "
"15376960","15378460"," The green line coming up."
"15379000","15383380"," And the opportunity for some, and you can see this monthly here."
"15383940","15385560"," I want you to see this monthly right here. "
"15385680","15387020"," It's been closely here."
"15388700","15392480"," I want you to see how supportive the market has been of this monthly down here."
"15392940","15394760"," Right here, supportive, right?"
"15395200","15396300"," Tried to break below the monthly. "
"15396300","15397120"," Couldn't do it."
"15397120","15401140"," So it starts to beg the question of where is the high here?"
"15401340","15401860"," Is it 180?"
"15402200","15402900"," Is it 160?"
"15403640","15404480"," Is it 164?"
"15405320","15405420"," Right?"
"15405980","15409740"," And so right now, apple is bullish at this moment."
"15409920","15416460"," So unless we see some breaking of key levels on apple and spy, the move is still up. "
"15416740","15421620"," When apple is trading above this yellow line right here, right?"
"15422360","15422820"," It's bullish."
"15423340","15425400"," You can see the defense of that yellow line."
"15425400","15427340"," This is daily trend defended. "
"15427960","15428460"," Defended."
"15428820","15434200"," Even if apple rolls over here, as long as this daily is maintained and defended, it's going to move"
"15434200","15435320"," up here is my point."
"15435800","15442440"," So even if apple rolls down, if it was to defend 154, 150, it's still in a bullish context. "
"15443580","15443680"," Right?"
"15444020","15447160"," So you have to give that to the bulls until that breaks."
"15447840","15451980"," To let daily trend breaks on apple, it's a bull's trade."
"15452820","15453400"," Does that make sense?"
"15453400","15456300"," You need to have price get below the daily, right?"
"15456420","15457320"," And start to trade lower. "
"15457520","15461820"," So you can get the meat of the move lower on apple specifically."
"15463000","15467640"," So just looking at this right now, unless you start breaking these key levels."
"15468200","15473200"," So right now in apple, 151, 27. "
"15475100","15479700"," Way down here, unless this area right here is broken."
"15479700","15483160"," It's just another pullback for apple to go higher here."
"15483540","15484300"," Does that make sense?"
"15484860","15486920"," Now you can take this trade and try to sell this down. "
"15487120","15491880"," But trend right now for bulls is just buying this daily all the way up."
"15492480","15493060"," It's right here."
"15493320","15493820"," It's right here. "
"15494000","15494360"," It's right here."
"15494820","15496940"," It's been like that since October."
"15497700","15500400"," It's been like that since summer of 2022. "
"15502080","15504140"," Here's a January or no sign October."
"15504720","15506480"," Here's January 4th."
"15507200","15507760"," And then back here. "
"15507760","15508540"," This is June."
"15509360","15513420"," Back here is October 14th, November 8th."
"15513480","15517180"," You've got buyers stepping in boom, boom, boom, four buyers. "
"15517900","15518820"," And they're all culminating."
"15519180","15523700"," All this is culminating in this rip face move higher inside the market."
"15523920","15527500"," Now I'm not saying like, can't sell this market down to the depths of hell. "
"15527500","15529720"," We're not going to sell this market down to the depths of hell."
"15530140","15535620"," All these bulls are waiting for just to get back down here to take this move even higher."
"15536480","15538100"," That's all they're looking for in Apple. "
"15541070","15541870"," Hold on here."
"15541930","15542750"," Bring that back there."
"15547120","15548600"," It's kind of crazy, right?"
"15549640","15554480"," And so when you're looking at spy right here, you know, spy has not followed suit, has it?"
"15555100","15560260"," And, you know, if they ever take this hedge off for any reason tomorrow, this market could just"
"15560260","15561040"," blast off. "
"15561400","15563020"," Like literally just blast off."
"15563020","15577850"," I guess"
"15584410","15586450"," if you're a bear, you want to like sell this market."
"15586690","15588930"," Like you're like, fuck yeah, bear, sell it. "
"15589530","15590490"," It's way down here."
"15591270","15593050"," Bear town, baby, 393."
"15593410","15594230"," It's actually even higher. "
"15594430","15595710"," It's 39391 or so."
"15596870","15598270"," Bear town is down up here."
"15599190","15600830"," And I'm not talking about coming down here. "
"15602050","15604110"," I'm not talking about slapping down below."
"15604530","15606230"," And then it comes back up and trades higher."
"15606390","15610050"," I'm talking about full rejection and get some new lows. "
"15610050","15612990"," Like full blast through this key level right here."
"15613430","15616790"," Bears need to bear bears need to just smash it down."
"15617550","15619150"," And that comes with news. "
"15621090","15624290"," That comes with news bears need bad news badly."
"15626570","15628970"," And I think raising rates 25 BPS."
"15630070","15632270"," I think that gets you 393. "
"15632570","15635450"," I don't think it gets you like a confirmed bloodbath."
"15638030","15638890"," I don't think it does."
"15639070","15640730"," I don't think you get the confirmed bloodbath. "
"15641070","15642710"," I think right now that what they're doing with these banks."
"15644550","15646290"," What they're doing with these banks is."
"15647010","15650370"," I think the move is going to be that right sideways and up. "
"15650610","15653990"," So if we get a blast down to 393, I think that."
"15654190","15656390"," But I think with 25 BPS, this gets bought."
"15658190","15659650"," I think this gets bought. "
"15659750","15664010"," I think Apple gets bought at 15168."
"15664010","15665730"," I think it gets bought."
"15665830","15668030"," I think buyer is separated at 15188. "
"15668430","15669110"," Trade 158."
"15670210","15671130"," 43 right now."
"15671730","15673110"," I'm about seven points lower. "
"15673450","15675170"," Bulls will step in and try to buy that."
"15676130","15678790"," Unless you get some kind of something."
"15679190","15681090"," I don't think that anybody cares about the Fed anymore. "
"15682570","15684770"," Like the Fed has fucked themselves."
"15685970","15686950"," Like point blank."
"15687630","15690250"," They have fucked themselves at this point in my view. "
"15691950","15695910"," By supporting these banks, they've lost credibility."
"15696990","15698890"," Fed has lost credibility in my view."
"15700330","15701870"," It becomes a viable dip. "
"15703170","15708010"," They need to do like 50 BPS tomorrow, something like that."
"15708270","15709790"," Outside of that, Fed has lost all credibility."
"15711570","15712410"," They really have. "
"15713350","15717010"," If you're not going to take money and be like, yeah, we're going to fuck you over in the stock"
"15717010","15717390"," market."
"15717390","15720050"," I think the buyer is going to step right back in."
"15720050","15728130"," Any bad news, unless you get 50 BPS or you get some kind of tone from the Fed saying, we're"
"15728130","15729230"," not going to support these banks. "
"15729770","15734730"," Maybe something, some kind of conversation like that in his press release."
"15735150","15738610"," Outside of that, they really did fuck up."
"15739230","15742270"," Like they fucked up so I can't stop saying F."
"15742590","15743890"," Stop dropping F bombs. "
"15744710","15746730"," But it's a disaster what they have done."
"15748710","15750230"," It's a full disaster."
"15763080","15764280"," Yeah, it's a disaster. "
"15764820","15766480"," Right now is a disaster for the Fed."
"15766900","15770760"," No matter how you look at it, there's nothing that can be said to save it."
"15771780","15773460"," They got nothing for me. "
"15777910","15779910"," You just you can't buy into them."
"15779910","15782210"," All the work that's been done is erased."
"15782970","15784230"," It's all erased right now. "
"15784890","15787210"," And there's no there's no renegotiating that."
"15787970","15788930"," That's what's happened."
"15789190","15790430"," They've supported the market. "
"15790630","15792470"," The Fed put is here whether you know it or not."
"15793350","15799230"," If they continue to raise rates and try to do this like, you know, raise rates to fight inflation,"
"15799230","15800810"," but we're still scamming."
"15801510","15803710"," They're going to front run this market going higher. "
"15805950","15809270"," So I'm very fascinated to see what the Fed has to say tomorrow."
"15810070","15816430"," I would be shocked to see the Fed step out and try to say, yeah, we're going to screw you"
"15816430","15816750"," over."
"15820070","15824410"," No, it's like, what do you mean you're going to screw like you're trying to front run 2008. "
"15825190","15826090"," Literally what it is."
"15826350","15830950"," It's like we're going to get out ahead of 2008 to protect ourselves and we're going to burn the"
"15830950","15832370"," market down in the course of this."
"15832370","15834450"," So I don't know. "
"15834710","15835990"," I don't know if that's how it happens."
"15836610","15838690"," I think the timeline is all screwed up right now, too."
"15839450","15845370"," You're talking about timelines of thinking maybe we get a bottom end of 2024. "
"15846290","15847210"," 2023, excuse me."
"15847290","15852110"," And then maybe 2024 that timelines out the window out the window."
"15854960","15855800"," Out the window. "
"15856120","15857420"," You can just you can kiss all that shit."
"15857520","15857700"," Goodbye."
"15858420","15858720"," Kiss. "
"15859420","15860880"," You can kiss fight inflation."
"15861000","15861080"," Goodbye."
"15861080","15865520"," And you already know that the balance sheets going up. "
"15865820","15870860"," What else can I say to you balance sheet goes up the market goes up."
"15871700","15873500"," I don't know how else to explain that."
"15878000","15881460"," You know, it's it's it's such a oxymoron right now. "
"15884900","15886280"," Yeah, they're in the box, dude."
"15886480","15887280"," They're totally in the box."
"15887520","15889140"," They're totally after right now. "
"15890960","15893740"," And there's nothing they can do about it."
"15893920","15896060"," Natural gas features jump over five percent."
"15900340","15904260"," They're so they should they shafted themselves. "
"15904980","15906440"," They totally did."
"15907460","15909240"," And there's nothing they can say about this."
"15910060","15910660"," There's nothing. "
"15916480","15917980"," They're so doomed."
"15921260","15922940"," The balance sheet goes up."
"15923280","15924460"," The market goes up. "
"15924740","15926240"," It's like that's not rocket science."
"15931860","15933580"," I don't know what else to say."
"15933740","15936920"," I don't know what what you tell me in the chat with a fed can say. "
"15937400","15938340"," It's going to be laughable."
"15939660","15941620"," Honestly, it's going to be laughable."
"15945420","15946700"," I totally agree. "
"15950220","15951780"," I totally agree."
"15952020","15952740"," It's such a disaster."
"15954760","15957500"," I think even bulls and bears are going to agree on some of this though. "
"15957720","15963200"," At least the smart ones out there know exactly how messed up this is."
"15970680","15972240"," It's a it's a total disaster."
"15973500","15975280"," Don't let anyone try to fool you out there. "
"15989360","15990620"," It's a total disaster."
"15991220","15992180"," It's a total disaster."
"15992180","15993280"," It's a total utter disaster. "
"15995440","15996580"," No makes gasoline."
"15996820","15997420"," April futures."
"15997780","16000180"," Two dollars and fifty three cents a gallon. "
"16000780","16001580"," And no makes diesel."
"16001940","16002500"," April futures."
"16002820","16005220"," That's about two dollars and sixty nine cents a gallon. "
"16005340","16006360"," Yeah, yeah, exactly."
"16010260","16011080"," I don't know."
"16011240","16013720"," I was trying to explain this this morning. "
"16013940","16015520"," I was like, I'm trying to explain this."
"16015620","16017360"," I'm like, you're you're not gonna."
"16017980","16019320"," You're not checking the market. "
"16019380","16021280"," You're seeing stocks rip higher."
"16021560","16022700"," You're saying Q's rip higher."
"16023380","16025440"," That's off the dollar and sixty nine cents. "
"16025700","16026980"," We'll two spot five percent."
"16028100","16032780"," You're seeing the market reacting away that's showing that we're at a bottom or near a bottom."
"16033160","16035580"," I don't care if spy sells off hundred fifty points tomorrow. "
"16035580","16036900"," The market's saying we're at a bottom."
"16038160","16039080"," So I don't know."
"16039180","16043260"," Maybe you knock it down on a fifty BPS or a hundred BPS or something, but that's bottom. "
"16043820","16047100"," Like we're either at the bottom or we're going to see a bottom in the next coming weeks."
"16047800","16049480"," So a nine makes natural gas."
"16049960","16052660"," Just like two dollars and thirty four cents. "
"16053120","16058220"," You're not going to reintroduce money into the system and not see the market go up as the key point"
"16058220","16058440"," here."
"16059620","16060740"," And I don't care."

"16070620","16071760"," I don't care, right?"
"16071860","16072520"," I'll be honest with you."
"16072560","16073460"," I don't care, right?"
"16073640","16078080"," If you if you printed money in 2020 2020 and 2021."
"16078740","16083960"," If you removed that money and stopped printing money, but now you're re-injecting it, the market's"
"16083960","16084420"," going up. "
"16086140","16088880"," And there's people out there that know better."
"16089080","16091500"," They're saying, this is how insane this is."
"16092180","16095980"," They're saying, hey, something other things are broken that we can't see. "
"16096540","16101440"," The Treasury Department and the Fed are trying to tell us that nothing's broken."
"16101740","16106960"," If you were in this stream earlier this morning, I said to you, no, it is worse than we think"
"16106960","16108560"," it is, right?"
"16108780","16109740"," So they're going to have to inject."
"16110980","16114080"," And not only that, they're going to try to inject what they already printed in the past. "
"16114080","16119500"," And then if they ever get to the point meeting liquidity to provide cash to foreign governments or"
"16119500","16120280"," even individuals."
"16121120","16125320"," If you have an individual, let's say, that lives in another country that's, hey, I want to get some"
"16125320","16126320"," dollars here, right?"
"16127120","16128860"," We don't have the liquidity to provide for that."
"16129020","16129840"," They're going to have to print more. "
"16130700","16136800"," Forget we've already printed and removed and warehoused, which we knew we were warehousing."
"16136940","16142760"," And if you read closely, if you read closely the removing of liquidity in the system, it wasn't all"
"16142760","16143880"," removed permanently."
"16145240","16147220"," They were warehousing some of this shit. "
"16147600","16148640"," It was inside the Fed."
"16148720","16152720"," The Fed actually released this information early this summer of 2022."
"16153360","16155480"," So they were warehousing parts of this money. "
"16156600","16161120"," And so now they're re-injecting it back into the economy."
"16161580","16164060"," I don't care how to cut slices and dice it."
"16164400","16165120"," That's what they're doing. "
"16165860","16170460"," And the moment they run out, if there is more broken than we haven't seen, they're going to have to"
"16170460","16172420"," reprint some even more money."
"16172420","16178960"," And so we're in this really insane place, a stupidly insane place."
"16179480","16185160"," And no matter what they say to you, if they continue to re-inject this old money that was printed,"
"16185760","16189000"," and if they're forced into printing new money, it's going to get front-ran. "
"16189540","16191140"," It'll get front-ran in the market."
"16191340","16192660"," You've seen it in tech right now."
"16194220","16195380"," It's going to get front-ran. "
"16199150","16200310"," It's so insane."
"16201110","16202410"," It's absolutely insane."
"16202410","16209210"," And by them backstoaps, by them backstopping, we know that's the case. "
"16209510","16211390"," We know what the truth is."
"16211490","16214130"," They can't hide that shit from the market."
"16216010","16217470"," So the Fed put is real. "
"16218610","16219710"," And they're doing it right now."
"16223640","16224560"," You know, you can't..."
"16224560","16231880"," I don't think that Jay Powell could come out here and beg and plead the stock market to go along"
"16231880","16232480"," with this."
"16232940","16233600"," They're not. "
"16235240","16237400"," The stock market's not going to go along with this."
"16237760","16239340"," The stock market's going to ride it up."
"16240060","16243280"," As long as they know that money's coming back in the system, as long as they know it's going to"
"16243280","16244300"," happen, they're going to buy the dip. "
"16245300","16248740"," Now, if you manufacture a low in the spy or whatever, fine, go do it."
"16248740","16249520"," But they're going to buy it."
"16250240","16251540"," There's a big difference here. "
"16252440","16253340"," You can't fight it."
"16253400","16257900"," And dude, all this shit they're doing is going to lead to a spike in inflation."
"16258880","16261540"," Even if it's not next month, it's going to be in three months. "
"16262140","16263120"," You're going to see it."
"16265200","16267580"," Like that whole inflation line coming down."
"16267780","16268140"," That's over. "
"16269080","16271480"," Bye-bye for at least the next three to six months."
"16274240","16277500"," Do you think they're going to bring out 50 BPS or 100 BPS?"
"16278300","16280460"," I guess that's what they have to do, right?"
"16281700","16284260"," All that hard work washed away."
"16284980","16285100"," Gone. "
"16287240","16287680"," Gone."
"16287680","16290700"," A full disaster."
"16292900","16301540"," The agreement that was made with Main Street, the agreement that was made with the stock market,"
"16301680","16305820"," the agreement that was made with the bond market, the cash market, the agreement that was made with"
"16305820","16308520"," foreign countries, it's all over. "
"16314240","16319040"," And now they're going to try to come out tomorrow and renegotiate a contract with you."
"16320740","16322560"," I don't know what you say to that."
"16325080","16326480"," You can't trust that. "
"16328360","16329240"," It's pure Encino."
"16329940","16330720"," It's pure insanity."
"16332380","16334180"," It's pure insanity. "
"16336830","16338110"," And I'm a bull, man."
"16338310","16338970"," Like I'm not a bear."
"16340430","16342910"," I'm like a bull going, yeah, keep doing what you're doing. "
"16343030","16344130"," Keep doing to break these things."
"16344410","16346710"," You tell me that a bank took on too much risk."
"16347370","16348490"," Then they tried to make excuses. "
"16349470","16351630"," Like, well, you know, they're buying bonds."
"16353190","16354890"," You know, they were raising rates."
"16354930","16356030"," They bought them at the wrong time. "
"16356150","16358630"," And I'm like, did they keep buying bonds when rates went up?"
"16358850","16359250"," No."
"16360990","16364830"," And the crazy part about this is we're not talking about prime banks."
"16365230","16366810"," And they've got bad bonds too, right?"
"16366950","16370710"," We already know that if they were to cash their bonds, then they're screwed too. "
"16373580","16374900"," We already know that they're screwed."
"16375600","16380380"," So, you know, if you had a run on prime banks, we'd be damaged."
"16381580","16385020"," So you see the parachute being thrown out already by these banks right now. "
"16385320","16386140"," They're getting the golden parachute."
"16386700","16391660"," They're, they're front running that golden parachute where they didn't in 2008."
"16392360","16395419"," So you're seeing that gold parachute being front run. "
"16395640","16400540"," And the scariest part of all of this is, well, they don't know if it's scary, but."
"16403060","16409580"," You have had to have had you have to look at these banks and said, well, if you were only"
"16409580","16417840"," at 35% of your of your of your stakeholders of your depositors, why didn't you then get another"
"16417840","16424740"," another 25 or 30% of bonds were in a rate hike cycle and they didn't do that."
"16424919","16425240"," Did they?"
"16428930","16432810"," You know, I can understand like the prime banks being like, well, we've already we've already"
"16432810","16436470"," backed all our depositors by 65% or 60%. "
"16436470","16438130"," But these banks didn't."
"16439150","16440630"," And they didn't afterwards either."
"16445460","16446820"," And we're bailing them out. "
"16450590","16454910"," If we're bailing that if we're bailing this high risk shit out like nothing, what do you think"
"16454910","16456330"," they're going to do to non high risk."
"16459779","16463460"," So it's like sitting at a poker table playing cards and you're like, okay, we're going to let this"
"16463460","16464360"," fail and let that fail."
"16464360","16465759"," You've broken some shit. "
"16466680","16468480"," We need more breakage to happen."
"16469860","16472680"," So now that I guess the question becomes, what are they going to do?"
"16472779","16474200"," They're going to say, we're going to save all the banks."
"16475640","16479700"," Is that what the conversation is tomorrow with with Jerome with Mr. Powell?"
"16479700","16480360"," Is that the question?"
"16481580","16482580"," Okay, we're going to save the banks. "
"16483759","16484860"," We're going to crash the stock market."
"16485540","16488000"," And we're going to burn down every last American."
"16488200","16492860"," And we're going to do it before it happens this time. "
"16494259","16497119"," Oh, and by the way, we want to bring liquidity back into the market."
"16497560","16498460"," We're going to give it to the banks."
"16499180","16501520"," It's a good to you to start making loans again. "
"16502200","16502560"," Cheap loans."
"16503439","16504099"," And then they keep it."
"16504840","16506119"," They already did this man. "
"16506300","16508080"," They did this in 2007 2008."
"16509759","16512000"," They'll be outraged over this outrage."
"16513880","16515680"," There has to be outrage over this. "
"16516960","16518140"," How could there not be?"
"16519860","16522099"," We're going to make you suffer with inflation."
"16523340","16525360"," Because they're going to start the bailout early."
"16526360","16527200"," Get out of here. "
"16532300","16533259"," Absolutely wild."
"16535080","16538750"," They're going to have to pay off."
"16538930","16542070"," They're going to have to pay off stock market holders, which is what they're doing right now. "
"16561939","16563960"," J.P.O. Go school on us tomorrow."
"16564800","16566119"," It says pure insanity."
"16566820","16567580"," Pure insanity. "

"16617700","16620259"," ripped face for 2021, it had never stopped."
"16620460","16621300"," It never looked back."
"16622099","16623980"," It never had any threat of really rolling over. "
"16624360","16627840"," And as long as you're doing that, this market's going to go high."
"16628860","16630380"," There's nothing else you can say about it."
"16632119","16634040"," You keep that balance sheet going up. "
"16634160","16635380"," This market's going to keep going up."
"16635439","16636980"," It's just going to melt faces up."
"16636980","16639259"," And you can say it to your blue in the face. "
"16639960","16642939"," But it's not the reality of what happens in the stock market."
"16643599","16648360"," And so that's my fascination with tomorrow is he's asking you to do that."
"16649060","16652880"," He's saying to you, well, we're going to back up all these rich people. "
"16653180","16654140"," Like, I mean rich."
"16654439","16655720"," You guys think you know what rich is?"
"16656380","16658540"," I don't care if you make a million dollars here."

"16664680","16667040"," And we're going to, we're going to fuck off. "
"16667240","16668700"," We're going to screw all of you over."
"16668800","16670040"," I don't know if that's going to fly, man."
"16670220","16673020"," This will be the first time in history that they've attempted this. "
"16674080","16675720"," I'm fascinated to see it happen."
"16676540","16677300"," I'm fascinated."
"16677480","16678919"," Maybe it happened in 1930. "
"16678919","16679619"," Have to look back."
"16679840","16683060"," But this would be like a fascinating moment in history where they're going to tell you."
"16683400","16685140"," They're going to try to negotiate with you. "
"16687439","16693619"," As they create new money and put it in their pockets and take all of your money away from you."
"16693619","16697640"," I think that shit might fly with Bob on Main Street or something."
"16697900","16700439"," But I don't think it flies with stock market participants. "
"16701540","16702320"," It just don't."
"16702820","16703779"," It never has."
"16723640","16724660"," It's just hilarious. "
"16725460","16725740"," I don't know."
"16725820","16726160"," I don't know."
"16726259","16728500"," I don't know people on Main Street. "
"16728700","16729020"," I want to."
"16729160","16730820"," I'm fascinated by this conversation."
"16731680","16732599"," I'm fascinated by. "
"16732880","16737540"," I'm fascinated if he just does the 25 BPS and just keeps the normal speech."
"16738380","16740279"," Like the normal speech is always been giving."
"16741119","16743279"," Because I see this market going up if he does that. "
"16743520","16744099"," I do."
"16744919","16745580"," I do."
"16745700","16748360"," He's basically giving carte blanche to the market to rip faces off. "
"16749680","16750660"," He basically is."
"16750759","16751740"," That's basically what he's doing."
"16751880","16753320"," If he keeps like the normal tone. "
"16754580","16756840"," He keeps the we're going to backstop these banks."
"16757080","16757880"," We're going to raise rates."
"16758080","16758740"," We're going to fight inflation. "
"16759500","16760980"," Here's your 25 BPS."
"16761619","16763980"," I really do think that that's a nod to the."
"16763980","16767779"," It's not the stock market that hey run it up. "
"16768279","16771939"," And meanwhile we're going to screw over Mary and Bob on Main Street."
"16772580","16773860"," Just don't tell him okay."
"16777580","16780200"," If he says that that's what I think is going to happen. "
"16780780","16781260"," Not think."
"16781500","16782280"," I mean you just look at it."
"16782360","16783380"," You see the balance sheet man. "
"16783460","16783820"," It's simple."
"16787620","16788420"," Print money."
"16790120","16794000"," Even if it's old money that they took out of the system that they're sending it back in. "
"16796600","16799340"," Oh yeah squeeze it baby 397 43."
"16800440","16802660"," I'm back to flat on my calls right now."
"16804140","16805660"," But I'm holding them into the bell. "
"16806580","16808420"," I don't believe it for a minute."
"16810780","16813740"," And you shouldn't either."
"16814100","16815020"," I mean you really shouldn't. "
"16815720","16819200"," There's a lot of bears out there that I get along with because they know."

"16823500","16826180"," They know it's a scam going on right now and you should be outraged. "
"16826620","16829040"," I really believe that you should if you're if you're a normal."
"16829600","16832380"," If you make less than like I don't know."

"16856480","16857020"," Absolutely."
"16859140","16863260"," And inevitably inflation's not going anywhere. "

"16870040","16871820"," All that hard work gone."
"16873000","16873940"," How long did it take them?"
"16873940","16875060"," Two weeks. "
"16875860","16878420"," Took them two weeks."
"16880400","16883360"," Two weeks gone."
"16885020","16886820"," It's pure insanity. "

"17085270","17088390"," Yeah we're probably nineteen thirties like we can't do this."
"17088910","17092450"," So we've got to coax them along until they accept fire inflation. "
"17093670","17097190"," You should see new targets come out for inflation if they haven't I haven't seen them any."
"17097530","17100350"," They haven't seen the news but I would not be shocked."

"17154570","17159250"," I'm still long calls in this bell I believe right here that they're going to squeeze this up now."

"17176730","17178210"," bell is looking for a squeeze too."
"17179450","17184190"," I think the only way they sell this down is in low liquidity environments. "
"17185710","17187250"," So let's say they pin this close."
"17188110","17190690"," Let's say you pin if they pin this close here."

"17741730","17743170"," If we can get the VIX down to like $20."
"17744330","17748090"," Let me look on VIX real quick and give you another target we talked about VIX earlier today. "

"17767430","17769130"," $4.5 by Thursday."
"17772110","17776670"," Not trading $3.98.02. Screaming on."
"17776670","17781990"," We got a price started about $3.98.34. Hopefully they got caught in that bear trap earlier. "
"17783230","17784410"," And you traded this higher."
"17785190","17787630"," And you believe that this market would be supportive."
"17789490","17791790"," Even the day before the Fed meeting. "
"17805790","17807830"," So just between here and the top here."

"17832050","17834050"," They are free baby if we go up."
"17835190","17837770"," So if you put back spreads if we go up you get paid."

"17841970","17842530"," You get paid."

"17870250","17870670"," Sorry."
"17871090","17874270"," You're selling it in the money put and you're buying two. "
"17874870","17878030"," Outside the money lower puts below."
"17878530","17880970"," Just seeing some comments from the Goldman Sachs CEO."
"17881250","17885590"," See a Waldron who tells handles blood that the recent events are different from the financial"
"17885590","17885970"," crisis. "
"17885970","17890930"," 15 years ago says the primary issue is customer confidence in the safety of their deposits at"
"17890930","17895510"," smaller regional banks in the U.S. One up there and tag out three ninety eight thirty four please."
"17898450","17902830"," And how about a price target above of three ninety eight ninety nine."
"17903890","17907130"," Let's give that one up here try three ninety eight ninety nine. "
"17910250","17913130"," How about ninety eight three ninety eight ninety eight up there."
"17915250","17923660"," Can we get that into the bell power hour an hour left into tomorrow's trade."
"17923860","17926000"," So you're positioning into tomorrow. "
"17926380","17928120"," We're going to talk about that."
"17933040","17935000"," No, no, no, hold on."
"17935000","17936420"," Did a fucking good day, man. "
"17936960","17939120"," Wish I was fucking trading yesterday."
"17940680","17941800"," Kind of pissy."
"17943720","17944280"," Okay. "
"17944620","17946180"," So we got a five days."
"17950840","17953720"," What do bears need tomorrow."
"17960700","17962880"," That's screaming higher right now. "
"17970220","17971120"," Trading up."
"17971420","17974060"," I guess a bear would call this a double top above here."
"17976060","17977520"," Applied move for tomorrow. "
"17979460","17981940"," Price target above four oh two fifty four."
"17982060","17986780"," We will likely fail to meet this if we squeeze higher tomorrow."
"17988700","17994420"," Implied move in the low low end three ninety one and change three ninety one eighty nine somewhere"
"17994420","17994940"," down in here. "
"17995120","18001160"," We'd likely fail to go back to the market volatility will remain high in the short term at least."
"18001460","18005820"," So again, I'm speaking to handles blood likely fail to make this low down here."
"18006020","18006120"," Right. "
"18006320","18006900"," Come back up."
"18006980","18010100"," We get the rejection though above on this key level."
"18010640","18011120"," Right. "
"18011400","18013920"," Then we would know that the move the move is lower tomorrow."
"18013920","18014460"," Okay."
"18015380","18017180"," How I'm positioned for tomorrow. "
"18017480","18021800"," Personally, I've got a bunch of puts left over littered inside of my account."
"18022520","18026400"," I'm going to leave those on for tomorrow in case we get a bloodbath."
"18026580","18031520"," In case we get any kind of nightmare scenario and hold those as crash protection on the downside"
"18031520","18032160"," tomorrow. "
"18033720","18035980"," My what my thoughts are on tomorrow."
"18036320","18039060"," What my thoughts are on tomorrow is."
"18039520","18040620"," I don't know. "
"18040620","18041920"," I think."
"18043440","18046080"," I think that the Fed comes out tomorrow and."
"18046520","18048920"," He stays the course twenty five BPS. "
"18051040","18052200"," Twenty five BPS."
"18052920","18054440"," Some kind of hawkish tone."
"18055420","18059160"," You're going to see weakness in the market from that and then he's going to say. "
"18060820","18063380"," But behind door number two, we got to talk about something."
"18063780","18066000"," And I think that's where the market stops crashing."
"18066000","18069480"," So you get some kind of like bloodbath here. "
"18069960","18073440"," Maybe a squeeze higher than a bloodbath here and then it gets back stopped."
"18075080","18077120"," By his conversation about banks."
"18077540","18078720"," I don't think that they can. "
"18079760","18081120"," Unless I don't know something."
"18082260","18085980"," I don't think that anything they can say that the market's going to listen to as long as they're"
"18085980","18088220"," pumping the money with the money back into the market."
"18088960","18094900"," Another market, but into banks and bonds and all that kind of stuff. "
"18096560","18101820"," As long as they're doing that, man, it often finds its way back into our."
"18103100","18107660"," You know, looking at the after effects and the after effects are critical here."
"18108080","18110040"," Capital requirements at smaller and regional banks. "
"18110040","18111200"," According to handles."
"18111480","18115880"," That's just to repeat that Goldman Sachs CEO of water and says industry should actually expect"
"18115880","18120100"," strict rules and strict capital requirements at smaller and regional banks."
"18120660","18121700"," Now with that said. "
"18122700","18124100"," With that said, right?"
"18124840","18128480"," If let's say we come down here tomorrow, this dream is sponsored by any point."
"18128640","18130820"," We come up, squeeze up higher than we saw up down here."
"18131200","18133020"," It's just a chance for me to buy it. "
"18133860","18139360"," Unless some kind of material changes come from from the fed."
"18141640","18148000"," Yeah, we squeeze higher, squeeze higher, squeeze higher, like that, that, that panic weakness that"
"18148000","18148580"," we have twice."
"18149360","18153100"," We have the initial panic weakness when the feds going to release the statement that we have the"
"18153100","18156300"," next weakness that comes into play when they do the interview. "
"18156860","18160460"," Now, nothing changes, nothing material changes, probably a dipped by."
"18161660","18167300"," If they pause rates, if in my view, I can be wrong here."
"18167400","18170800"," Don't be taking what I say as as as this is it. "
"18171020","18175780"," But if they pause or cut rates, I think we squeeze uncontrollably higher."
"18177960","18182720"," And then we sell this market down and find a low like squeeze like crazy squeezing."
"18184520","18190960"," If they do a 50 BPS rate hike and hawkish and all that kind of stuff, we're going to bloodbath"
"18190960","18191520"," this thing. "
"18191980","18194340"," It's going to be ugly, but that's not my expectation."
"18194500","18202200"," My expectation is 25 BPS hawkish tone markets looking like it's going to go to the depths of hell"
"18202200","18203640"," and then he comes out and he has to."
"18205200","18207040"," He's going to tell you that's all bullshit. "
"18210280","18212960"," He's going to tell you that they're back sobbing."
"18213400","18214400"," That's what he's going to tell you."
"18214700","18217040"," And you're going to see these strokers come out next week. "
"18218260","18221860"," I forget if it's Thursday this week, yelling is going to go out or they're going to have these"
"18221860","18222660"," hearings and shit."
"18223360","18225880"," And they're going to rattle their swords at you and all that."
"18226060","18231540"," But the truth is, the truth is that inflation is going up. "
"18234590","18236410"," Yeah, I see the bullwhip day tomorrow too."
"18237990","18240030"," I see the bullwhip day tomorrow as well."
"18240110","18242890"," So this is your implied move right now for tomorrow. "
"18243190","18247470"," This implied move will change end of day at the close."
"18247790","18251950"," It's probably going to go higher, probably 405 and then this will come up."
"18252050","18254610"," I'm assuming that this implied move has moved up now at this point. "
"18255690","18257950"," This implied move has probably gone higher at this point."
"18258150","18262350"," And this close will show that implied move going like 405 roughly 405."
"18266010","18266950"," Look at that. "
"18267090","18268930"," Look at that beefcake move right there."
"18269810","18271130"," Look at that beefcake move."
"18272990","18275050"," Just squeezing faces off. "
"18275890","18278030"," And they'll probably squeeze up into this close too."
"18278130","18280010"," I don't see this not squeezing higher."
"18280870","18282730"," I see this squeezed into the bell. "
"18283610","18284690"," Believe it or not."
"18287650","18288710"," What a scam."
"18289570","18290350"," Total scam. "
"18293050","18294510"," Man, I'll tell you what, man."
"18296230","18296670"," Disappointed."
"18297490","18299230"," If you're a bear out there, you should be disappointed. "
"18300650","18303530"," If I was a bear, I'd be pissed off right now."
"18303890","18305630"," I'd be quite upset right now."
"18307750","18309650"," It's not what you're looking for. "
"18311450","18313410"," If you're a bear, you're looking for."
"18315810","18317030"," You're looking for some wreckage."
"18317030","18320290"," And you're looking for. "
"18322650","18324310"," You know, the firm hand, right?"
"18324430","18325770"," You're looking for the hawkish tone."
"18326190","18328750"," You definitely, definitely."
"18329610","18331210"," Did not want to see. "
"18332390","18336510"," That you didn't want to see the balance sheet go up to where it's gone."
"18336910","18340830"," That is a bad, bad look for bears."
"18341510","18342370"," It really is. "
"18343090","18345070"," There's nothing else you can say about it."
"18345070","18346430"," I'll tell you what, man."
"18346510","18351530"," The Senate banking committee ought to send it banking to hold a March 28th hearing on the SBB"
"18351530","18351890"," collapse. "
"18352510","18354910"," Yeah, that's the hearing I'm talking about right there."
"18357230","18360010"," They can try to set up any way they want, but I'll be honest with you."
"18360170","18364870"," As a main streeter and not would take my stock hat off like a stock market hat. "
"18366150","18367230"," Enraged right now."
"18368370","18368770"," Enraged."
"18371710","18371990"," Enraged. "
"18373050","18373530"," Enraged."
"18373730","18374490"," Hands down."
"18376230","18377190"," Absolutely disgusted. "
"18380290","18383530"," I was saying this morning in stream as they first came on, I said."
"18384610","18389050"," I said, they should be handing out checks to every American right now."
"18389510","18390530"," Every single one. "
"18391450","18395090"," If you have to deal with this shit longer because of what they're doing right now, they might as"
"18395090","18396050"," well help you out too."
"18396530","18397410"," Because that's what they're doing."
"18398170","18399910"," That is what they're doing for certain people. "
"18399910","18401350"," They're not doing it for you."
"18403970","18405650"," They're not doing it for you and they should."
"18407670","18409570"," They should cut rates at a minimum. "
"18411350","18415530"," Not only should they be cutting rates, they should be cutting checks for if you're having a hard"
"18415530","18416890"," time out there, you should get a check."
"18417370","18418430"," And they're not going to do that, right?"
"18418630","18419110"," We already know that."
"18419370","18420350"," Those days are over. "
"18422840","18426420"," But they're going to try to renegotiate an argument with you tomorrow."
"18426820","18429380"," In my view, they're going to try to renegotiate an argument with you."
"18429380","18432220"," And they're going to be like, how about we just fuck Main Street. "
"18432300","18433720"," We make the stock market go up."
"18438160","18438640"," Disgusting."
"18439520","18440000"," Gross. "
"18441920","18447620"," Now trading $3.9834, pin strike on previous high on the daily."
"18447920","18449620"," A new high on the day right now."
"18449740","18451240"," There goes your H line right there. "
"18452000","18453560"," Just tagged it like it was nothing."
"18455140","18459520"," We have one more price target above $3.98. I believe it is."
"18460120","18462480"," And this is on the implied move on this morning. "
"18463700","18464940"," Coming into today."
"18471110","18472050"," I'm serious, man."
"18472230","18473990"," This is real stuff like in real life. "
"18474450","18476190"," This is like crazy."
"18477330","18478450"," Absolute insanity."
"18480430","18481470"," That was a bear. "
"18481570","18482030"," It'd be raging."
"18482450","18483290"," That was the Main Street."
"18488510","18489810"," That's what they're doing. "
"18492550","18493670"," That's what they're doing."
"18493930","18495870"," They're telling you, don't worry, we're going to bankroll you."
"18497910","18499050"," Not your mortgage. "
"18500930","18503970"," They're going to bankroll somebody else's mortgage."
"18505050","18509830"," And the worst part is they're telling these people, fuck it, put more risk on."
"18510650","18514990"," But my favorite part too is that they're like, well, we're going to hold Senate hearings. "
"18516010","18517370"," We're going to change the rules."
"18517810","18520810"," Those rules are meant to be broken by very smart people, right?"
"18521430","18521830"," Can you imagine?"
"18522270","18523990"," This is like what 2008 all over."
"18524670","18527630"," Slap my hand, but here's some here to put on some more risk. "
"18529190","18531010"," Find another way to beat the system."
"18535170","18537910"," Man, to be a bear, I would be enraged."
"18539750","18543590"," And as a Main Street person, if you're not in the stock market and you're watching this broadcast"
"18543590","18552390"," right now, that would be furious, furious, furious that you were asked to do all this hard work. "
"18553070","18554630"," And now they're not even going to come help you."
"18554770","18561610"," They're just going to try to tell you not only do we need you to carry that 100 pound on"
"18561610","18562130"," your back."
"18562890","18564630"," Well, we build these guys out over here. "

"18570690","18572650"," I E and I O nine and 10. "
"18572650","18573590"," We didn't do that."
"18579770","18580530"," Tilling me."
"18581810","18582250"," The fed. "
"18587640","18589820"," The fed disaster on our hands."

"18595190","18595630"," Gross."
"18596650","18599010"," I don't think we've ever seen fleecing like this."
"18600050","18601690"," I don't think I tried to look. "
"18601870","18603570"," The only time I haven't looked at is 1930."
"18605930","18606610"," To see."
"18607070","18608430"," I've checked every one of these things. "
"18608670","18610430"," It's got to be before 1930 or something."
"18612550","18614270"," It's got to be about before 1930."
"18615150","18619570"," Like the absolute fleecing of America in real time right now. "
"18620530","18624470"," Free front front run front running the fleecing of America."
"18625890","18628330"," Where they didn't see SWAT credit default swaps."
"18628930","18629730"," They saw this. "
"18632530","18633750"," They saw this."
"18634150","18639290"," They got in front of it."
"18646010","18646450"," Gross. "
"18646930","18647850"," Absolutely disgusting."
"18648410","18648990"," It really is."
"18653470","18654610"," 2037 ish right. "
"18654870","18657830"," I think I'm assuming that's a bear is looking for on the VIX."
"18661630","18662510"," Absolutely disgusting."
"18663310","18665130"," And they're going to ask you to be a partner in it. "
"18666030","18667310"," As a stock market participant."
"18667910","18669690"," They're going to ask you to be a partner in this."
"18671610","18673670"," They want they want you to get your hands dirty. "
"18675790","18677030"," That's the idea right."
"18677650","18678910"," We're going to take all this money."
"18679050","18681350"," We're going to pocket it and we're asking you. "
"18682590","18685690"," We get like 1963 in the VIX maybe into this close."
"18688180","18691060"," You know they're basically asking you and I right now."
"18691280","18693140"," Maybe you're going to take some of this into this bell here. "
"18694640","18695440"," Hold on here."
"18697980","18698880"," Hold on here."

"18709900","18710900"," I don't think you shouldn't."
"18711600","18712600"," This is what we do. "
"18712760","18714480"," This is the gross part of our job."
"18715500","18721260"," Like the filthy like when you find out that regular people don't like stock market participants."
"18722040","18723420"," This is one of those situations. "
"18723460","18729400"," It's one of those situations where you're being bought by banks bought by the Fed as a market"
"18729400","18730040"," participant."
"18730040","18736120"," If you own stock like Apple, if you own stock like Tesla, you're basically being bribed right now"
"18736120","18737120"," by these people."

"18740720","18741400"," Don't say anything."
"18757590","18758930"," Does that make sense to you out there?"
"18759030","18760430"," Maybe that makes better sense to you. "
"18774120","18775560"," Can't wait for Black Wednesday."
"18779380","18781320"," It's an old fashioned French tickler."

"18783940","18784620"," This is the part."
"18784880","18789900"," This is the part of the this is the part where we get bribed to carry along."

"18859450","18860530"," So terrible. "
"18861310","18861830"," Oh, yeah."
"18866750","18870430"," Put it on the backs of regular people out there in the world."
"18871970","18873510"," Tell your constituents. "
"18873990","18876950"," If you're a politician that you saved their 401k."
"18877330","18882630"," SBB loans to insiders tripled to two hundred and nineteen million dollars before it failed."
"18883090","18887690"," So just to repeat the SBB loans to insiders tripled to two hundred and nineteen million. "
"18888050","18890770"," Yeah, three ninety sevens now print forty dollar forty four right here."
"18891350","18892270"," I'm long again."
"18892730","18894790"," So I'm hoping I can get one more little push here. "
"18896030","18898110"," We have one more fat little print here."
"18905460","18910320"," And I can't even imagine if this hedge ever comes off three percent in a day done."
"18911020","18912300"," Three percent one day. "
"18912400","18915820"," We're going to trade one one point one eighteen on the day."

"18939080","18940320"," Such an awful song."
"18941560","18942540"," And it's disgusting. "
"18944080","18945820"," And they can't even tell people that."
"18953070","18954250"," Yeah, it's gallows humor."
"18954610","18955090"," That's what it is. "
"18955470","18956250"," Straight gallows humor."
"18964600","18966280"," I'm fascinated with what they say tomorrow."
"18967480","18967840"," Fascinated. "
"18970260","18971820"," I can't hear the magic of the background."
"18972180","18972800"," Okay, what's we're going to do?"
"18972880","18973620"," We're going to talk them down."
"18975380","18976480"," We're going to talk them down. "
"18976620","18977200"," The Fed meeting."
"18977420","18979080"," We're going to try to get the stock market down a little bit."
"18985590","18990470"," We just committed a heist and took five hundred billion dollars to get it come up with something. "
"18996940","19000040"," And we're going to blame."
"19000280","19001180"," We're going to blame them."
"19003360","19004360"," It's your fault. "
"19008380","19009900"," It's your fault that we're here."
"19009900","19014460"," Oh, yeah."
"19014720","19015660"," Oh, here we go. "
"19015840","19017240"," Keep on squeezing, baby."
"19018000","19020100"," Get it on up there for daddy."
"19025070","19026390"," Yeah, Main Street did. "
"19026710","19027770"," It's all Main Street's fault."
"19037140","19044460"," It's all your fault."
"19044740","19045740"," Main Street, USA. "
"19046280","19047180"," Look what you did to us."
"19049840","19051640"," You made us rob the piggy bank."
"19063770","19066630"," Main Street loosened financial conditions. "
"19079400","19080840"," It's all Main Street's fault."
"19081300","19081480"," Definitely."
"19098200","19099240"," Absolutely disgusting. "
"19099700","19100340"," What am I doing here?"
"19101100","19101720"," Hold on here."
"19102400","19104700"," I'm going to get the right the right mouse here."
"19110100","19112280"," Absolute devastation, the VIX today. "
"19112540","19113560"," Absolute devastation."
"19120510","19123890"," So we're right above now on Tesla."
"19124590","19129010"," Tesla wants to hold one ninety four and seven cents. "
"19129890","19132450"," And then wait for the hourly to come back up on one eighty."
"19132710","19135670"," It's currently sits at one eighty one eighty seven eighty eight."
"19136410","19141210"," Well, we've got the daily the weekly and the monthly coming up for support. "
"19141210","19146270"," If you're trying to get an entry into Tesla, the best place is one eighty seven sixty seven."
"19146930","19152050"," Although there's probably a buy above it one ninety four fourteen on Tesla."
"19156260","19159140"," Apple training all day long off. "
"19159260","19159640"," It's hourly."
"19160420","19163540"," It's hourly currently sits at one fifty six eighty seven."
"19164320","19168660"," Although it's daily sits down below at one fifty one thirty five. "
"19178180","19180660"," Nvidia hourly bought with relentless power."
"19182320","19183900"," Currently the hourly sits at."
"19185560","19189180"," Two fifty eight forty four right now on on a video. "
"19202840","19205740"," If you're someone just I just saw someone saying in a."
"19208960","19211720"," In DMS here, something about the market rolling over."
"19212640","19214180"," You're going to want to get above."
"19215120","19219180"," Twenty two dollars on VIX for that rollover here. "
"19220820","19225580"," We do have some weakness showing could come back down and trade right down to three ninety seven"
"19225580","19226120"," thirty four."
"19226800","19229060"," You see here, it's only three twenty six in the afternoon."
"19229060","19230660"," Could see a trade below here. "
"19233880","19237260"," Bulls, you're looking for the VIX to reject point two zero three."
"19249480","19251080"," This is your five minute right here."
"19251560","19253180"," You got to keep all of these. "
"19254700","19257440"," Colors the same and switch switch them around right now."
"19273530","19274810"," Yeah, the Q and A tomorrow."
"19274930","19277970"," I think it's I think my take here is that it's twenty. "
"19278390","19279690"," I think that they try."
"19281870","19285290"," I mean, the idea here would be what Jay Powell do twenty five BPS."
"19287530","19290430"," Get hawkish on the market and then go. "
"19291530","19293570"," Say cut some kind of nonsense like."
"19294370","19296770"," We're holding hearings next week on the twenty eight."
"19296770","19297570"," We're going to hold hearings. "
"19299350","19303310"," And you know, we're going to slap some risks and we're going to require."
"19305030","19306150"," Better better."
"19306370","19308830"," I don't know. "
"19311110","19315470"," We're going to require you have to find with the fuck that part the fuck that part of this."
"19317270","19321230"," Is we know there's systemic risk right now to prime banks."
"19321770","19325870"," So prime banks have to hold sixty five percent right. "
"19326770","19334090"," Of available or liquid look liquid data ball assets to cover a runner itself, right?"
"19334710","19337170"," If anything, if anything."
"19338650","19344810"," Banks probably should be able to keep a lower liquidity like let's call it thirty five percent."
"19345270","19346750"," But be required. "
"19347750","19353570"," To work its way up to sixty five percent in a high rate environment."
"19355430","19356470"," Like federal law."
"19357750","19362970"," So if we're in a zero rate environment, banks have to keep thirty five percent forty percent. "
"19364750","19368990"," If we hit every every point that we go up or every two or three points, they have to add"
"19368990","19369830"," like ten percent."
"19371810","19375110"," They have to buy bonds at higher rates, right?"
"19379120","19381120"," But they're not going to do that in those hearings, are they?"
"19384270","19390090"," Or how about liquidate your own assets and then buy more bonds be required to do that?"
"19390950","19395070"," Maybe consolidation of prime banks forced into it."
"19395250","19396670"," We don't do that right now, do we?"
"19406080","19410180"," I'm fascinated to hear what that conversation is in the Senate because you know they're not going"
"19410180","19410620"," to do it. "
"19410680","19411820"," Even if they were going to do it."
"19412920","19417520"," You know, you can't have like you can't these banks do make money, but at the same time."
"19418420","19425600"," We see that if any of the craziest part about this is you probably could have had the fine. "
"19425700","19432360"," The regionals are probably safe, would have been safer than these prime banks."
"19432560","19437300"," These prime banks are who's really screwed because they're already maxed out at sixty seventy"
"19437300","19437700"," percent."
"19440900","19442420"," You could write right into the charter. "
"19446160","19447720"," We can tell you this is crazy."
"19452600","19455520"," Yeah, forced them to compete to bond rates with savings interest."
"19461420","19465440"," Yeah, or even if what about if they had sold their bonds and moved over to savings, right?"
"19465620","19466380"," Maybe make that chip. "
"19466380","19469360"," In balance eight hundred sixty three million to the south side."
"19481040","19486060"," Yeah, I've lost all respect being of any shred of respect that I had for J-POW."
"19487980","19489000"," I don't know, man. "
"19489400","19490220"," I was trying."
"19490740","19492680"," All credibility is out the window right now."
"19493540","19497440"," All credibility for the fed is out the window from my perspective. "
"19499080","19501040"," Any credibility that it had is now gone."
"19501260","19503420"," I think that was the last straw for me forever and ever."
"19509190","19510590"," I thought they were doing good. "
"19510830","19514370"," I thought they were doing good in terms of their agreement."
"19515950","19523130"," I thought their agreement to this point going even back through COVID going back into COVID and"
"19523130","19526650"," then going back to when they telegraphed, we're going to do this and we're going to do that."
"19527890","19535570"," I think it's disgusting with that they told us in advance that they're going to raise rates and"
"19535570","19545420"," none of these banks did anything to protect themselves knowing the rate and environment"
"19545420","19546300"," we were coming into. "
"19547020","19548060"," They did nothing."
"19549680","19551020"," They took the money and ran."
"19551760","19552520"," It's wrong. "
"19555320","19556600"," It's wrong, man."
"19556740","19558000"," It is totally wrong."
"19558260","19558860"," It is wrong. "
"19559140","19560140"," It's disgusting and gross."
"19560940","19564860"," And then seeing these VCs out there, I don't want to fucking hear it."
"19565500","19568920"," The worst part is a lot of these people, they said they don't. "
"19569540","19574520"," They either should have or did have insurance policies to cover all this money."
"19576420","19579040"," You remember, these are the smartest minds out there, right?"
"19579700","19580640"," These are the smart people."
"19580640","19583860"," I saw this, I talked about this sometimes. "
"19585940","19592700"," Whenever you get the leaked emails and the leaked texts, the leaked phone calls, any of that shit,"
"19592780","19598660"," whenever it comes out, these are the people that are pointing fingers at you and they're telling"
"19598660","19599880"," you how smart they are."
"19601520","19603920"," Then you find out that they were just buying zero date puts."
"19605520","19606760"," They're buying zero date calls. "
"19607880","19609600"," Every time, every single fucking time."
"19613680","19617240"," They're putting risk on and they're telling you not to, but they are."
"19617820","19620220"," They know more than you know, but that's what they're doing. "
"19623380","19633280"," There was a couple famous hedge fund guys and a hedge fund, not hedge fund, a short operation"
"19633280","19640260"," that allegedly had a bunch of those emails and text messages leaked last year."
"19640260","19649360"," These guys are allegedly dropping news against individual tickers and then they were just buying"
"19649360","19650040"," zero date puts."
"19651080","19652760"," They sound like rocket scientists. "
"19653600","19654520"," What are they doing in the background?"
"19655800","19656780"," What we do?"
"19662760","19664180"," They're rocket scientists."
"19666240","19667480"," There's like a group of them."
"19668000","19672060"," It's like a sorority or fraternity. "
"19678130","19679490"," It's like not how smart you are."
"19679610","19680070"," It's who you know."
"19681870","19683030"," You're an idea guy. "
"19685310","19686890"," You're not the technical guy."
"19687050","19687590"," You're the idea guy."
"19687630","19689670"," Now I have to give some respect to that. "
"19690890","19696850"," Idea guys and idea girls, they can push things forward and I agree with that."
"19698550","19702730"," At the same time when you find out what they're doing, they disregard the technical people in the"
"19702730","19707850"," background telling you, yes, we can or no, we can't."
"19719020","19719780"," We can't sell off now. "
"19722260","19726980"," You know, the best thing for us to sell this market is tomorrow is for us to leave this up"

"19733570","19735030"," Maybe we don't, but I'll show it to you. "
"19753120","19756960"," The idea here would be to close this market in an illiquid environment."
"19759400","19764260"," The only way it gets underneath here tomorrow is if it can be done in the overnight."
"19765100","19769800"," So if you're like if your hedge fund or if you're a bank, you sell this in the overnight. "
"19771480","19774140"," Because otherwise in cash market, this is showing strength."
"19774460","19776020"," Like this is strength in cash market."
"19776520","19780100"," You're not going to get weakness here unless it's the overnight. "
"19780560","19783980"," The only way to get weakness on the market traps some bulls."
"19784760","19794540"," If you're going to trap some bulls here, you need to see, you want to see this like after hours"
"19794540","19794780"," here."
"19794900","19796060"," You want to see sellers come in. "
"19797360","19799380"," Try to drag and push this down in the overnight."
"19800340","19801460"," It's right underneath here."
"19801640","19801940"," We'll look at it. "
"19802060","19802840"," Yes, the same way."
"19803100","19803920"," Yes, the better."
"19804060","19805420"," It has to be better to look at here. "
"19811570","19812730"," Same thing for yes."
"19812990","19813890"," Yes, needs to."
"19815670","19816330"," Get underneath. "
"19816770","19818690"," Get underneath this stuff."
"19818930","19821630"," Like right now, yes is looking strong into this close."
"19822530","19822970"," Strong. "
"19827780","19828220"," Strong."
"19828620","19831640"," Would not shock me to see us gap up in the overnight and then sell off."
"19832560","19833740"," Here's going to be my prediction. "
"19833740","19839660"," In the after hours, gap up higher and then take a nice fat short in tomorrow."
"19840600","19842620"," Try to tag four zero eight zero possible."
"19845090","19846610"," Try to tag that in the overnight. "
"19846770","19848350"," Take a nice short position up here."

"19865960","19867720"," Got some kind of wonky that's going on."
"19881130","19882030"," I had a guess. "
"19883170","19887010"," We run this up into the bell and we run this up into overnight."
"19887010","19888890"," Just where it needs to be shorted."
"19889170","19895430"," If you're a futures trader, globex trader, you're looking for a nice high to grab a short in the"

"20864680","20866260"," We're doing a bunch of crap in the background."
"20867340","20868420"," We're getting close though."
"20868540","20869680"," We're getting to this point where I'm like. "

"20900540","20902120"," Yeah I'm going to put a hedge on up here. "
"20902820","20903300"," But I got."
"20903580","20905280"," So I have right now I've got."
"20906340","20908240"," Like 200 puts right now. "
"20909000","20911340"," I've got some that are close in the money."
"20911680","20913460"," For tomorrow and I've got another."
"20913460","20914680"," I've got another. "
"20914860","20916300"," I've got some crash puts too."
"20916840","20919020"," I've got like 365 p that are worthless."

"20921300","20923440"," I don't want to see any kind of craziness happen in the market."
"20930400","20931380"," Yeah that's right brothers."
"20931680","20932420"," So 25 bucks. "
"20932640","20932900"," What do I do?"
"20933160","20935040"," What I'll do is I'll send out."
"20935660","20937080"," I'll send out the wife."
"20938340","20939460"," And ask her if she'll grab. "
"20941660","20943680"," Maybe decoration unless they already have them."
"20943680","20944000"," I don't know."
"20944100","20945580"," So they're being really quiet right now. "
"20947080","20949020"," I'll just tell her I'll tell her."
"20949140","20949920"," Take 25 bucks."
"20950300","20951300"," We'll get some from the boys. "
"20957330","20958390"," La Koon capital."
"20959090","20959770"," Biscuit Baker."
"20966520","20968400"," Oh no the 18 hour days aren't from streaming. "
"20968680","20970280"," They're from the background work that we're doing."
"20971000","20971940"," I have to go back to."
"20972440","20974840"," Like in the background we're doing a bunch of crap. "
"20975020","20975800"," And I took a quick break."
"20976440","20977600"," It was like I needed a week or two off."
"20977980","20979180"," Into the pension my family. "
"20979920","20982340"," And now I got to go back to right right back at it again."
"20982340","20984160"," I was like behind the scenes stuff."
"20986060","20987880"," Looks like we're going to pin this in the bell huh. "
"20988160","20990340"," It's three ninety eight ninety eight trying to pin this in the bell."
"20990660","20992680"," Okay so we've got five minutes left to the close."
"20993240","20994800"," You have my predictions for tomorrow. "
"20995700","21000600"," If you want to know what I would say to you would be either be hedged right here into this"
"21000600","21000820"," close."
"21001760","21004940"," Some cheap edges or you just flat into tomorrow."
"21005080","21007360"," So I've got some hedges on for tomorrow. "
"21009460","21012320"," I'm going to be looking for the important part about today."
"21012320","21014480"," Tomorrow is looking to not get caught."
"21015340","21017000"," If you don't know about this stuff. "
"21023040","21025900"," I don't want to get caught tomorrow in."
"21027580","21029880"," I don't want to get caught in tomorrow is."
"21032780","21034400"," I don't want to get trapped in here. "
"21034520","21035060"," Does that make sense?"
"21035460","21037260"," I don't want to be in here trapped fucking around."
"21037980","21040900"," You know I want to catch like a squeeze up and a squeeze down."
"21041000","21041880"," I want to trade this stuff. "
"21041880","21045340"," The easiest way to trade this stuff tomorrow is a reaction trade."
"21045680","21047220"," So if we bleed down you buy the dip."
"21047400","21048900"," If we rip up you sell the rip. "
"21049040","21049560"," Does that make sense?"
"21050320","21052620"," You just trade trading this zone here tomorrow."
"21053620","21054560"," We'll trade this together."
"21054700","21055620"," We trade this live every time. "
"21056860","21060240"," So if we bleed off and down you buy a dip for a rip higher."
"21060760","21063800"," If we squeeze higher you're selling the rip down here right."
"21064180","21065700"," So just reaction trading all day long. "
"21066120","21067200"," It's fairly easy to do."
"21067900","21071620"," I'll try to see if I can set up some guests tomorrow before the day."
"21072220","21074080"," Maybe we can get a guest earlier in the morning. "
"21074760","21075480"," But show up tomorrow."
"21075940","21077400"," I like making money on these days."
"21077840","21079040"," I do a fairly good job. "
"21079840","21084520"," Consistently if you look at my trading on these days they're usually pretty good."
"21085040","21089640"," Now if the market becomes oversaturated with calls or puts they're too expensive on a zero date."
"21090260","21092220"," I'll wait sometimes for the initial move. "
"21092940","21094320"," So let's say I don't buy a call or a put."
"21094460","21095060"," We rip up here."
"21095700","21097840"," I can then get some cheap puts to trade this down. "
"21097840","21100080"," Now you already have my take."
"21100160","21102340"," I'm going to talk about it all day long what to expect tomorrow."
"21103020","21105000"," From the Fed and from Jerome Powell. "
"21105460","21111020"," I discussed with the market and we have some range expansion coming our way into the end of the"
"21111020","21111620"," month here."
"21112080","21113760"," Huge range expansion coming of the way."
"21113900","21121180"," Don't forget the JPM, the JPM caller that's on the market into the 31st. "
"21121560","21124440"," And we've got that Senate volatility now added into next week."
"21124920","21126320"," Let's maybe get up onto a high."
"21126540","21128920"," We trade down into that Senate hearing into the end of the month. "
"21129460","21133780"," For some kind of a pin around 4060 or lower."
"21142340","21143720"," Yeah I birthed all of y'all out there."
"21143860","21146520"," If any of you guys are celebrating birthday I have a birthday to you. "
"21147760","21150340"," If you're wishing me a happy birthday I appreciate the well wishes."
"21153970","21155990"," Medford guy you in Medford right now or what?"
"21156410","21157150"," I know Medford well."
"21158410","21159030"," I know Medford. "
"21159030","21163010"," I don't tell my wife but I used to date a girl in Medford a long time ago."
"21163930","21165350"," I was young though I was a young guy."
"21168010","21172770"," The White House says Biden's focus has been on strengthening the banking system and protecting"
"21172770","21173770"," depositors. "
"21177930","21180230"," So out of that trade right there so don't get caught."
"21184870","21187730"," And I'm flat outside of some put stuff that I have left over."
"21187890","21190750"," These are all free puts that I have for tomorrow. "
"21190750","21194390"," And that's going to be my protection tomorrow in case anything happens in the overnight."
"21195190","21198990"," But otherwise flat not looking to buy calls in this overnight for a squeeze higher."
