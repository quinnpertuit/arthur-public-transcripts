"TJlTQ4K-NEA","0","7940"," Good evening, traders. Captain Jim James here with your daily breathe. I haven't made"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","7940","14900"," a video in a little bit here, but I did say I wanted to put a video out as we are, you"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","14900","19780"," know, at a point in the market where people start to get anxious, a little bit of fear"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","19780","24100"," in the market possibly. As you know, well, first we're going to look at the E-mini. This"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","24100","30900"," represents, you know, the S&P 500, the spy. It's a slightly different chart than SPX and"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","30900","37940"," spy, but it's the most complete in terms of the complete moves that are made in the day"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","37940","47460"," and in the overnight. In past videos, I've talked about how you could use this chart"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","47460","56020"," with basic resistance and basic support lines to know when to make entry in the market."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","56020","61380"," Now, as you know, small caps can somewhat move on its own. It'll sometimes, you know,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","61380","68100"," move independently of the spy and the cues as well, Nasdaq, but this is a pretty complete"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","68100","76220"," composite that still represents the top heavy indexes, indexes, which means, you know, there"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","76220","81980"," are only so many stocks that actually move an index. And most of those stocks are included"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","81980","90620"," to some extent in all three indexes. So to look at the S&P, the 500 is fine. You know,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","90620","93900"," we don't have to look at the other indexes tonight. So if you're in another, if you're"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","93900","100580"," in a specific stock, if you're in an Apple, if you're in Tesla, even though Tesla does"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","100580","107300"," move on its own, Tesla can also move with the market when the banks want it to. So this"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","107300","111060"," is a good indicator to use for we are right now. Now, and you know, you know, in the past that we've"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","111060","116900"," talked again, we've known the past that we've talked about where you can make your long entries"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","116900","122580"," on a chart like this, right? And you know when to get out of your long entries in a chart like this."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","122580","129540"," We could probably make anywhere from eight, nine, 10 longs in a year and probably five,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","129540","137860"," six shorts in the year and would be 100, 100% win rate using just a chart like this. And I went"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","137860","145140"," all the way back to March of 2020 for a reason. And that's because we broke below this channel"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","145140","151300"," over here in the bottom left. And we came, we fought our way back up with, you know, infinite QE."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","151940","156900"," And I wanted to show this part of the chart to you. Because if you look below here, right?"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","158100","162820"," Yeah, we made this new channel here. And we took a small rest once we were in this channel."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","163380","168580"," And even though we kept going up, there were rests along the way. And there was this one stretch here"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","169700","174100"," where we went right out, right out, right out and above our trading channel. We did that once"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","174100","181060"," again later on. But the importance is that the stock market does go up and it comes back down."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","182260","191300"," Even on long runs, there are small areas where we either trade sideways with small downward movements"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","192020","198660"," or we trade sideways for some relief, some downward relief. And some are more pronounced than others,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","198660","207620"," right? So we can look even in here on this move up here, you'll still see that we retraced back"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","207700","212500"," into the bottom of this channel, right? And they tested three times if we wanted to go down."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","212500","216740"," And on the third time when we said, no, we're not breaking this, we want to go up, we went up,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","216740","223220"," right? The market forced its way up. Now we did it twice more. We were told no again,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","223220","228820"," so we made another run up. And so the way the market flows, it's important to pay attention"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","228820","235460"," to these things. One other thing that I want you to notice is that this year, a lot of you"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","235460","242500"," have known that depending upon where we are in the month, during the monthly and quarterly"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","243300","250420"," OPEC cycles, that you can kind of track when, if we're bullish or if we're bearish for that month"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","250420","256420"," or quarter, where we're headed and when we're going to sell off, you can just check the dates."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","256420","262820"," You can see here, this is the 13th, right? They brought it back up to print on the 17th and then"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","262820","267700"," of course the, I think the Mayo pecs was the 20th. And I'm going to bet you that the 18th of"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","267700","273780"," June was the OPEC's again on the 20th of July. And then back down here, the 19th of August,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","274660","279940"," this was the 21st of September, right? This one we were expecting this move, but we were not"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","279940","287700"," expecting this further move down. Now, we did talk about in the past when you, let's say we get"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","287700","293940"," down to this bottom of this channel, right? We, I tell you to, when you first start to re-enter,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","294660","299540"," you can take long in the money, well, actually in the money would be right over here, long in the"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","299540","306740"," money, call spreads, right? I said one to three months out, this is October 18th and over here"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","306740","313060"," is the 17th. So if you were to start there and then we continued to sell off, it would still"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","313140","320020"," recover at some point down the road to print those call options. And the real reason for that is"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","320660","330260"," with modern monetary theory, the Fed does step in. Now, we just had, we just had the coronavirus,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","330260","336900"," right? A year, or almost two years ago now, that affected our market. And they went through extraordinary"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","336900","342180"," measures to try to control it. Does that mean that we're always going to be able to control"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","342180","348340"," what happens to our market, if it's going to do like a natural black swan event or something? No."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","348340","356580"," But we did have a black swan event in 2020. And we applied tools to force the stock market into"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","356580","363300"," a recovery. So even if we have those events, the Fed, as of right now, and until it doesn't work,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","363300","368740"," does step in. And you can see it right in here as well. When we started to correct over here,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","368740","373620"," this deeper correction, everyone was saying that it was going to be a black swan, right?"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","373620","378260"," And it turned into not being a black swan. So if you had gotten, as we've talked about,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","378260","386740"," more aggressive as we continued to fall, eventually, once it did make this turn above here,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","386740","392340"," and if the VIX was to match up, you would be fine, right? You would know how aggressive you can get"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","392420","398020"," with your lungs. And so now some time has passed since the last video that I've made."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","398580","405060"," And I think somewhere in here is when I stopped making videos, and I didn't make anything during"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","405060","410900"," this run. But I want to talk to you about where we are in this run, because it is important."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","410900","419300"," And the reason is that we hesitated here on October 27, right? So you see this hesitation,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","419540","426820"," this red candle here. This wasn't a relief rally. This was a hesitation if we wanted to break"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","426820","434260"," through into this old trading channel that we had. It was indecision. And it's important to"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","434260","441380"," understand that that was indecision. And the same thing was up here on November 1st. This is when we"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","441380","446980"," had this week over here on Monday, when we first came to the week, people were uncertain as to"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","446980","450900"," what the week would hold, right? So you want to look at some of these candles for what they"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","450900","458980"," represent. Was it an actual pullback, right? And they weren't. So technically we've had one"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","458980","464900"," possibly two red candles, but from the start of this move down below, it's just been relentless."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","464900","470580"," And when you start to overextend like this, post it earlier tonight, a chart showing where we are"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","471300","478660"," with the VIX. And it's not creating fair in the market. It's creating complacency in the market,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","478660","482900"," I should say. So there's no fair in the market, right? And when there's no fair in the market,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","482900","487140"," we shouldn't be starting our long positions. We want to be starting your long positions when"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","487140","492340"," we're in peak fair down below here. And when I post that stuff on Twitter, oftentimes I get"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","492340","497540"," ripped to pieces, you know. I usually get yelled at when I'm telling people to get get long in the"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","497620","503540"," market. And I usually get yelled at when I tell people to start closing their lungs."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","504260","509940"," So when we start to get to that, to either one of those extremes, I always use that as a gauge."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","510740","514340"," So I'll start getting really bullish when everything's really bearish. And while everything's really"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","514340","522740"," bullish right now, I'm starting to get bearish publicly. And of course, I'm getting a pushback."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","522740","528820"," And so that's my, that's my gauge to feel or to check to see if we're actually long in this,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","528820","534260"," or if we should continue to stay long in this market or not. And the reason for that is that"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","534260","539860"," oftentimes people will miss this move down below here. They won't get long. They're, they're"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","539860","545540"," fearful. They'll push back on me saying get long down here. And then once we're up here,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","545540","551540"," they might start getting long and they're thinking to themselves, I have to stay in this long position"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","551540","560100"," or capture some of this money, because everybody else is getting rich. Okay. Meanwhile, the smart"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","560100","565380"," traders made all their money down here, right? And so they're taking on less and less risk as we"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","565380","572020"," make this move up. So that's important. For what we are right here, I want to talk to you about a"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","572020","578980"," few things here. The advanced or decline list, there's some people put out like 200 or 300 ticker"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","578980","585220"," advanced or decline list. There are lists that are bigger. And they also, some of the lists also"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","585220","590740"," show how long people have been in these long positions. That's an important detail that is"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","590740","597540"," sometimes left out. So if I was going to enter, let's say Apple on the 1st of October, you want to"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","597540","603700"," see how Apple's doing one month later, right? And you want to think about how long does a bank"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","603700","610020"," hold a position? So if a bank goes in long, let's say with $100 million on Apple long, right? You"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","610020","615700"," want to know how or you want to think to yourself, how long are they going to hold that long for it"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","615700","621220"," to make them money? Right? How long are they willing to hold it? Is it for 20 days? Is it for 50"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","621220","628020"," days, 100 days, 180 days, 360 days? Usually it's no longer than a quarter. When you hear about"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","628020","632660"," rebalancing, right? You know that there's some small rebalancing that takes place each at the end"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","632740","637940"," of each month with OPEX. You know that there's much larger rebalancing that takes place every"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","637940","642020"," quarter, right? So you know, let's say three months at max, they're going to hold most of their"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","642020","649940"," positions, right? So on our intermediate charts, we look pretty good here. We look, they look like"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","649940","656180"," people want to stay in until we get to this top up here. So when I say to you, hey, when I'm on"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","656180","660100"," Twitter, let's say, and I say, hey, there might be a small pullback, right? The reason I'm saying"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","660100","665780"," that is for two reasons. I'm saying it because whenever we make big moves, right, we tend to"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","665780","671220"," trade sideways. This is a sideways move here. And then we'll push up, right? And then we'll tend"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","671220","678500"," to trade sideways or retest below if we need to check to see if we actually want to go this high"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","678500","685380"," up here, right? So that's just basic stock trading. So you need to know that. So let's get on a"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","685380","690580"," smaller chart here, okay? And let's put something else in. Let's put, let's go back to the one year."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","690580","699460"," Why don't do something else for you? So OPEC's this year is a believe on the 19th. So what we'll do"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","701220","709860"," is we're going to put a the 19th, we're going to put OPEC's, okay? You can see where OPEC's is."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","710740","715140"," And you can see normally with OPEC's, right? We'll start to trail off. We came up, right?"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","715140","720420"," We're leading up to OPEC's. Let's say, let's say this is what? Right here is the fourth or fifth,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","720420","727940"," right? A little bit of a pullback, just a little bit of relief. We pushed up, right? To where they"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","727940","735060"," wanted it. And they closed their, their spreads. And then we sold off into OPEC's, right? So pretty"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","735060","741780"," much the week before OPEC's we sell off. So we know we've got the 19th here. So you figure,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","741860","747220"," let's say on the 12th, you want to be done being long. That would be the plan, right?"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","748100","753300"," We're going to, we're going to, we're going to stop being long no later than the 12th at the"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","753300","759860"," latest. That would be, we need to get to four, let's make this, let's put this on a smaller chart."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","763060","764580"," So we want to get to,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","764740","775140"," we want to get to somewhere up in here, right? 476, 6.25. That's what you want to be, right?"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","775140","780980"," If you're a bull, you're like, I want to go and make max money, max gains. That's what you're"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","780980","786420"," looking for. Whether we hit that now, or if we jump above and over, and you start to have to think"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","786420","793460"," to yourself, can we get here from here to there with some form of relief or trading sideways? Does"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","793540","799300"," that even happen, right? Then this chart, it really doesn't show itself well. So we'll make"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","799300","804500"," the chart a little bit smaller and start looking closer, right? So you can see it's nice, we have"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","804500","809540"," this nice push up, right? Because we got to get moving, right? To get up here, we need to get moving."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","809540","815220"," If the bulls want to get up there, we don't have a lot of time. We're going to have a smaller chart,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","815940","822740"," right? And this right here, this is the fourth. We have until the 12th. Well, let's say that"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","822740","833460"," then the 11th. Let's move it to the 12th. I think at the 12th at 1600, right? So we have from here"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","833460","839860"," to here to get up here. And then kind of see that we've done some trading sideways, right? You can"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","839860","844980"," see this is November 3rd. This is yesterday. We traded sideways. We really do really kind of want"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","844980","850820"," to get like this, right? And then you climb this up here, or push this above above if we can, right?"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","851620","857140"," And I've talked to you on Twitter before saying, by any dip that you can any relief that you can"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","857140","863140"," get down here, we bought this and rode this one up. I've just been day trading inside of this area"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","863140","869140"," here. But I haven't taken along here. And the reason being is because of where we're at. We're"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","869140","874180"," bringing down a smaller, smaller timeframe here. I think is that the one month? Let's get inside this"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","874180","882020"," one month. And let's start to put some known supports. We know that this is a major support here,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","882020","886340"," right? We know that this trend line is major support. You can see we kind of ride around on it,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","886340","892420"," right? So this number is going to change every day. We know that tomorrow that it's going to be"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","892420","900180"," 4608.25. This would probably be the worst it would be unless we did a liquidation, a mass"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","900180","910820"," liquidation. We can draw in some decent supports. We've got one right here, right? We know that we"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","910820","915860"," pushed up and we're able to hold this for two days, I think, right? We pushed up in the third"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","915860","920580"," of fourth. And now we're heading into the fifth. We're looking very bullish, right? So we'll take this"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","920580","931220"," down for five days. You can start to see, right? We can start to adjust these. We know we've got"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","931220","936580"," some support here. We know that this is a scary area here, right? You could say that there's some"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","936580","945780"," support in here, a minor support. Somewhere at the halfway mark, right? The bulls will want to defend"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","945780","951220"," this right here, right? They'll definitely want to defend this area here. But this is a long way"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","951220","956180"," down too. If you start to break through this, it's possible that we just let it go and push back"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","956180","962100"," up. So we know that, you know that coming into tomorrow that we're looking at like 4608.50, chart"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","962100","973140"," that for yourself. You got 4630.50, right? Then somewhere in here, we've got 4650.75, right? Take"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","973140","983060"," the auto off. Make this a little bit smaller. We know we had some resistance over here. We saw"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","983060","987300"," this resistance today. We had that same resistance at the end of the day, right? Remember that we"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","987300","991620"," pushed it up right into the four o'clock hour. So we need to break through that. We have already"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","991620","997540"," tried twice. Sometimes futures will do that for you. If we can't push it up, they'll push it up,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","997540","1004020"," a bank, bots, and the algorithms will push it up. So we already have some decent support here,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1004020","1010420"," right? And you can see where the dips are to buy, right? This is kind of like sell everything"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1010420","1016020"," down here. You've got one. We've got a resistance. This is going to be now be your R1. It's your S1,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1016020","1022020"," your S2, and your S3 for tomorrow, right? Let's go back out a little bit."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1022900","1027380"," And I take that off. We can start to see"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1029700","1036500"," in the kind of neat that right down below here, right? This all kind of matches up on the 12th."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1036500","1042900"," Isn't this weird how the map kind of is the 12th at the 1400, let's say? Isn't it neat how"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1043700","1051860"," this big push up right here kind of coincides with what took place during the FOMC?"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1052420","1056660"," Right? So this was like a decision area, right? Are we going up or are we going down?"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1057220","1062260"," So this is very bullish here, right? So you could just buy this right now if you wanted to. If you"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1062260","1068180"," bought a call spread or something that's in the money, right? Or slight, let's say it was slight,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1068180","1075540"," let's say you did a call spread that was like 4, 6, 3, up to like 4, 6, 8, 5,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1075620","1082660"," probably have a 75%, 85% chance of that printing between now and the 12th. Even if we had a little"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1082660","1087140"," bit of a push down, you could at least get out of it if you needed to without too much damage."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1089060","1094180"," And you could also start thinking about putting a hedge on, right? You could put some kind of a"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1094180","1098980"," hedge that's somewhere somewhere right where we are, something that's kind of in the money,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1098980","1103540"," because you can bet your ass that between now and the 18th, we're going to come back down."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1103540","1109620"," I'll bet your ass, but you can pretty much guarantee that between now and November"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1109620","1114900"," OPEX that we're coming back down. So you could probably get in the money, put spread as insurance"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1114900","1121300"," at this point that expires. You could make it the 18th of November, you could make it the week after"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1121300","1126100"," November or the last week of November somewhere into like the 30th or something. Is there even"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1126100","1132660"," a 30th in November? Yeah. So we've got till the 30th, you could put a put spread on in here,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1132660","1136500"," something that's directly in the money. That would protect you this whole root here."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1136500","1140900"," If you wanted to go long, you know that we're going to make a run to get up in here,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1140900","1146020"," and you know that it's going to come back down at some point over here. So there's your protection,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1146020","1153140"," right? In the money, put spread at the open tomorrow. And you hold on to that thing as you go long"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1153140","1161460"," from now into the first week of OPEX. And the price target for OPEX would be $47.66.25, right?"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1162660","1169620"," You could probably guess where some of the resistance points are going to be."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1171220","1173780"," You can see how this is pretty close, right?"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1177540","1181300"," It's a little bit bigger. Probably have one,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1182180","1191380"," two, or six, 72. We like to break through that. And 72.50, I bet, is a, is a"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1194260","1199700"," I bet your 72.50 is going to be a psychological, I'll bring 47.50."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1202100","1206660"," I had to guess. That's going to be the psychological breakthrough is up here."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1207540","1211940"," Now, we have, we're on November 4th, right? We've got,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1214020","1225780"," basically, we've got tomorrow and all of next week. And we're going from 46.74 to 47.66. That's"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1225780","1231860"," about 90, 90 handles or something, 90 points, something like that. I think that's what it is."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1232820","1236980"," No. Yeah, I think that we're roughly somewhere in there. I'm not going to look that closely."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1238100","1243940"," We can do that. We've shown that we can do it before, but you want to start to consider this"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1243940","1249460"," in time. You want to start to think about, as we move forward, are we just trading sideways?"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1250900","1257540"," Are the pullbacks too deep to make that push up? And how aggressive you want to get to make,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1257540","1262020"," to make this in this timeframe, that you figure we got, what, six trading days left?"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1263140","1267460"," Six, maybe if we were to go into the following Monday, you would get in the seven trading days."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1268500","1273780"," That's like 20 points a day, something like that. Maybe we have one or two big pushes,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1273780","1279220"," makes a 10 points a day, and then maybe we have two big pushes from here until there, okay?"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1279780","1286420"," So in this point forward, I'm going to leave you with, buy yourself some protection. If you think"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1286420","1292180"," that we're going to come up over here and then push even higher, I'd say that's on the table."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1292740","1296820"," But if we, if you do go long in here, let's say you were to buy like month, one month,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1296820","1303860"," two month out calls that are, you know, let's say you get them for like 4750, right? You get a"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1303860","1308820"," calls like a month out, two months out that can get hammered with a small pullback."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1309780","1316260"," You just want to ride those from now until the 12th of November, you could easily do that."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1316740","1321620"," You could do that with some protection too and still make a ton of money. If you're"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1321620","1326980"," to do that with a put in the money, put spread or put debit spread, you know, it doesn't matter"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1326980","1332420"," if it's a debit spread or a calendar spread or whatever, but you want to put some kind of"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1332420","1337780"," insurance on as we make this run up. And then what you can do is not worry. What you do is you just"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1337780","1343300"," sit back from now until the 12th and you know that you're covered either way. You know that if"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1343380","1347780"," we sell off and start to sell down that your put spread is going to cover your entry"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1348980","1356740"," into your calls, you know that there's a what 70% chance that afterwards it's still going to come"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1356740","1360980"," down and print, right? So even if you don't get paid on your put spread and you print out your"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1360980","1365380"," call spread or your, your straight calls up in here, you know, you're going to be able to collect"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1365380","1369860"," the money from your calls and then you know, you're going to be able to collect your money"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1369860","1373700"," from your hedge. Now there are probably some of you bulls out here that think that we're going"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1373700","1379460"," to go to this 4700, 4766, we're going to start riding this thing up for the next two months"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1379460","1385620"," right in December. I guess that's possible and even if it is possible, you could just hold on,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1385620","1391140"," you could just hold on to your your calls that are expiring in a month or two later"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1391140","1395620"," and those things will be worth, you know, diamonds. I get the gold that you'll make and you wouldn't"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1395620","1400740"," even be caring about your put spread at that point and you can apply this to any stocks that"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1400740","1405940"," you're in, any of the big stocks that you're in. You may not be able to apply it 100% to"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1406900","1413460"," let's say small caps and you probably can't apply it 100% to let's say a meme stock or something"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1413460","1418900"," like that but generally speaking for the market where we are in the market and where we're headed"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1418900","1424740"," and for some of the fear that's out there, how there or that's starting to grow, I want you to know"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1424740","1430900"," that there are ways to mitigate that fear, put a hedge on and still be looking to make a ton of"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1430900","1436180"," money. Now the only problem that we still have in here is that you've had so many green days."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1437460","1442580"," So I still stand by my thought that we're going to have one shake out at some point"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1443140","1447380"," between now and here, we're going to have a shake out and it's probably going to look like"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1447380","1453060"," doom and gloom and death even if it's for a brief moment, just enough to get you to sell"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1453060","1461140"," and then it's going to make this huge all-time high, it's huge 47 or 66 or whatever that's up there."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1462180","1468980"," Okay so my plan going forward, as of right now I put on my hedge today to get this nice beautiful"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1468980","1474980"," sexy hedge, it's going to last from here to here. I'll day trade this until we do get our pullback"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1474980","1481060"," if we even get it and but I'll day trade it, if we do get that pullback I'll take one more big long"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1481060","1486100"," into the 12. That's all I've got for you. I'll make some other videos here shortly,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1486100","1492980"," I'll do some on the VIX and I'll do some like basic ways to follow the VIX. There are ways for"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1492980","1500260"," you to make money swing trading, taking longs on for one, two, three months and not having to worry"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1500260","1505860"," about them by the quarter. There are ways for you to, we've talked about day trading"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1506820","1513460"," and I'll do a day trading video because I switch what I do. I'll do, I'll take longs on way down here"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1513460","1518100"," and then I get out of them and I'll only take day trades unless we have a pullback or an event"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1518100","1524660"," like this. I did get long in here but I did sell as well. I took my money and ran at the end of"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1524660","1529860"," the day. I was day trading this and I'll day trade this all the way up. If we do get one pullback"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1529860","1535940"," I will put on some form of a one month or two month out long to go with my hedge. I do want"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1535940","1542580"," to say that I appreciate everything, all the support that I get on Twitter. I did make some"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1542580","1549380"," comments on my Twitter handle about my comments section being all fucked up. That isn't directed"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1549380","1555620"," towards any of you that make jokes at me or complain about me and that kind of stuff. That's"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1555620","1565300"," all fine. I think sometimes Twitter you get bought accounts or you get new accounts that are"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1565300","1573220"," only there for the spectacle let's say Tesla going up or market burning and Twitter algorithms will"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1573220","1578980"," follow them too. I had one or two new Twitter users say I found you because you were recommended"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1578980","1586020"," this week when I made an account. I don't mind joking around. I don't mind fucking around. I don't"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1586020","1594260"," mind that stuff. What I do mind is just like the flaming. I mind when you're cluttering up other"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1594260","1599700"," people trying to have conversations that are serious in my comments sections. I put this"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1599700","1605060"," information out to give you guys help. If you guys don't like the shit that I post you think"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1605220","1610580"," when I post sucks if you think you're a better trader than me then just don't come inside my"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1610580","1617220"," fucking feed because I've been doing this for years. I know when to make money and when not to make"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1617220","1622740"," money. I know when things get too risky. I have my own rules. You probably have your own rules."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1622740","1627700"," I don't know how long you've been trading. I know for myself that when I've broken my rules"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1628420","1638420"," that I've burned my account. Not for $1,000, $10,000, $1,000 much bigger. You have to take on"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1639060","1645300"," whatever risk is good for you but this is what I do for a living. I have family I have to take"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1645300","1650980"," care of. I've got dogs I got to take care of. I have this life that I want to live and so"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1651940","1656980"," sometimes I know you guys want me to say we're going to the moon and we might be going to the"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1656980","1665380"," moon but I don't trade like that. I trade as safe as I can and to try to always win. That's how"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1665380","1670980"," the banks trade. That's why not all banks stay in business. Not all hedge funds stay in business"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1670980","1677460"," but that's how they trade. So I try to trade with them in mind. I try to trade thinking like they"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1677460","1683140"," think or try to trade. I'm always out. I don't ever ask myself what you're thinking or what I'm"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1683140","1687940"," thinking or what my friends are thinking. I'm always thinking to myself in the perspective"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1688660","1696740"," of a bank. When they're putting out 20, 30, 40, 50, $100 million, when they're buying $32"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1696740","1703540"," billion or $3 billion of a stock in one fucking day, I'm wondering why they're putting that in."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1704580","1710020"," How long they're in with that stock and why? Are they trying to sell out of the market?"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1710900","1714340"," They're trying to buy into the market. Are they selling the market down to you in the smaller"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1714340","1722980"," banks? All those kind of things. I don't know where I'm going with this. I get what I'm trying"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1722980","1727620"," to say is I love all you guys. You guys are all awesome and it was really weird because after"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1727620","1734900"," this past couple of weeks, all of a sudden, all the new small follower accounts just disappeared."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1735780","1740100"," I have actually, there are some new small follower accounts that I've"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1740820","1746340"," friended because I do want you guys to know if you're legit, that I will follow you. I'll talk to"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1747220","1755140"," you. If you're constructive, we can discuss things. But the past two weeks, it was just"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1755140","1761380"," fucking crazy. It was absolutely fucking crazy. I don't do well in FOMO. I'm not really,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1762180","1768820"," I don't really get too hyped into FOMO. Even yesterday, when I'm in day trader mode,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1768820","1774420"," like yesterday, I sold my position right when we went into clothes yesterday and I had a fat"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1774420","1782820"," position, fat, stupid fat position. We went up again this morning, but that trade wasn't meant"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1782820","1788100"," for me to take into tomorrow, which is now today. That's the same with today. The only trade that"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1788180","1791620"," I put on, or I did take a couple of shorts and a couple of longs day trading,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1792660","1799380"," we were inside of our trading box, like boiler room shit. But the only other trade that I put"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1799380","1804100"," on where I looked at this, a chart like this and said, hey, what can I put on today that's long,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1804100","1809460"," right? Because you know, a put can be long and a call can be long. The only long that I saw today"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1809460","1817220"," was it in the money put spread from now into OPEC's. So consider that. And this still looks like,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1817300","1821220"," if you're thinking we're going to get a holiday or Christmas rally, it still looks like a holiday"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1821220","1827620"," or Christmas rally to me. And as far as FOMC went, you can say whatever you want, but I have to"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1827620","1832660"," trade what's in front of me until it doesn't work always. And if it wasn't clear enough for"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1832660","1838660"," any of you out there, you can say it was because of being a zoom meeting, you can say it was because"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1838660","1845620"," of this because of that. He, sometimes the news is meant to tell you other things and sometimes"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1845620","1850980"," the news is meant to tell you to carry on. You know, sometimes they're lying to you and sometimes"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1850980","1856660"," they're trying to tell you something else. That message from from Jerome the other day, from Jay"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1856660","1866260"," was nothing other than get at it. You know, the Fed, the Fed chair is not going to sit there and"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1866260","1873220"," tell you one thing and then do something to absolutely fuck you, the market, the fuck the United States"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1873300","1878100"," of America, it ain't happening. No, that doesn't mean that doing the right thing. That doesn't mean"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1878100","1881620"," that they know what the fuck they're doing. I don't think that they have any of those things,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1881620","1886580"," but you can definitely take from that message that he gave, right? The market is on. Now, that"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1886580","1892820"," doesn't mean we're going to 500 straight line. You will get pullbacks, you will get relief rallies,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1892820","1898980"," you'll get sideways movement from here to there. And in all honesty, thinking about this logically,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1899620","1905460"," if you were to do this move up here, come back down for this relief somewhere down in here in"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1906580","1914260"," November, right? You start looking at this over here and you start seeing this sell-off coming"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1914260","1920500"," into OPEX, you can easily see 500. Well, I don't know where we are over here, but let's say December,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1922020","1927940"," I can easily see 500 here. And the reason being is when we get into the holiday months,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1929220","1933380"," if some of you guys have been trading a long time, when they are good"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1934980","1941780"," holiday months, we tend to grind. It's a really weird thing. And you don't really want to be"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1941780","1947380"," day trading that. I'll do a video about that once we get into this OPEX November. When we"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1947380","1953220"," start putting our holiday trades on, it's like this weird grind. It just goes slowly straight up"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1953220","1958580"," to all-time highs you've never seen before, like right before Christmas, right before Hanukkah,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1958580","1963140"," whatever that changes every year. But you know, there's like that 17th of December,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1963140","1968740"," right under that, that December OPEX. I think that's December OPEX. But you'll see this weird"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1968740","1975540"," ask grind that just goes straight up. And what you do is you just put a stupid outside the money"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1975540","1983300"," call spread on. We'll chart it out wherever we are. And I guarantee you that if we make this"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1983300","1990100"," move up here, come back down for some relief for the bears, then we will make a kick-ass holiday"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1990100","1994900"," run. And you could literally just go about your business. You just go and spend some time with"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","1994900","2000100"," your family and your friends, kick back, check back every week or so, leading into the holidays."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2000100","2004420"," And you'll be cashing your stuff out. And you'll have a nice fat end-of-year bonus"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2005140","2009940"," for you and your loved ones, okay? As of right now. So you know the chicken change tomorrow."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2010020","2016020"," That's one other thing. Before I go today, you guys have to pay attention to how I trade."

"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2073940","2078340"," looking to fall down when we hit one of these things and then we're going to hopefully stay"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2078340","2082820"," above it, tap it two or three times, then move up, right? That's how you play support and resistance"

"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2242900","2249620"," while we're going up, sometimes I leave it on. So, I don't say on that topic, but just, I've had"

"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2254660","2260260"," I'm in day trader mode. So, I'm fucking bullish and I'm fucking bearish two, three times a day."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2260980","2268020"," All right. Anyways, please leave me a thumbs up, please share this with other traders."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2268020","2273780"," I have previous videos where I start from the beginning on how I trade. So, if you're trying"

"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2280340","2283700"," I start getting short up in here, right? This is when I start really short and there's one"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2283700","2289140"," we're up in here, right? I start looking for how many days we've been long, right? Always be looking"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2289140","2295860"," for that. So, how long have we been going in one straight line, right? I start feeling more"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2295860","2301940"," bearish and we're over here, right? There are signals that I'm looking for with the VIX to see"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2301940","2306820"," if I should start getting scared or if I should start getting ready. And this charting, right?"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2306820","2312980"," Then I've got macro and then I've got a volume profile or a market profile,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2312980","2316500"," not volume profile, market profile, which I'll do a video on that too for you."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2316500","2320660"," Because I do, you can start to see, the thing about market profile, a lot of guys"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2320660","2326580"," harp on market profile and once I learned market profile, I didn't have to look at the market"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2326580","2331300"," profile to actually see it on the chart. If you do market profile long enough, you'll figure out"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2331300","2339300"," that you stop needing to look at it. I really do. That sucks to say because I love the guys that"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2339380","2347940"," do market profile and then I do a base stuff on time, price, price time, volume. I'm always"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2347940","2354900"," looking for a low volume day. I'm always looking to see who has the most to lose and then I'm looking"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2354900","2359460"," for market conditions, right? I'm looking for the charts, right? I'm looking for some Elliott"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2359460","2367620"," Wave stuff. I follow one guy for Elliott Wave. His name is Bob Kendall. He's got a YouTube channel."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2367620","2374900"," He's spot on with his Elliott Wave stuff like, fuck, 80, 90% of the time, somewhere in there."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2375860","2380660"," He's one of the only Elliott Wave guys that I follow. So I follow that stuff. Anything I follow,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2380660","2384900"," that's something I follow, market sentiment, right? And then I follow news. The news that I"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2384900","2390100"," follow, I like news because they're either trying to tell you something or they're trying to scare"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2390100","2395620"," you or sometimes they're lying to you. So I like that. I like to piece all that stuff together."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2396580","2402500"," And then probably the last piece would be order flow. A lot of traders don't believe that"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2402500","2408980"," order flow affects the price movement in the stock market. I disagree with that. I put all those"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2408980","2415220"," pieces together, try to match it to order flow, try to match it to dark pool. When they're buying"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2415220","2420820"," and when they're selling down, they're a dark pool. And then match it to all this other stuff"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2421540","2426180"," that I get going on. So I'm more than willing to learn all the time. If I don't know something"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2426180","2431620"," and let's say I don't know a lot about bonds, I'll go find myself a bond guy on Twitter and I'll"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2431620","2435940"," start following them. I ask them questions. If I don't know something about a currency,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2435940","2442340"," I had to ask a guy a day about currencies between Australia, England, the United States."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2443460","2447620"," I had some questions leading into FOMC. So I follow those guys. They're a bunch of guys that"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2447620","2452660"," deal with VIX. That's all they trade. All they fucking trade is VIX. You find those guys as women"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2452660","2458500"," on Twitter if that's your thing. Or if you don't understand VIX, I can do a simple VIX how to use"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2458500","2465380"," VIX or how I use VIX to trade the spine. If you want to learn about the VIX, go find some guy"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2465380","2471540"," that's only trading the VIX. You would be surprised if someone comes in my comment section and says,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2471540","2476340"," hey, can you show me or teach me? I used to try to show people that and then I just started making"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2476340","2480820"," videos so that I didn't have to respond. I could just say, hey, find my YouTube channel,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2480820","2485460"," start the first video and start working your way through them so that it's more comprehensive,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2485460","2490260"," kind of get where I'm coming from. You get a better picture of where I am in the market."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2490260","2493780"," So you can see, and you can see, look at my cursor right here. You can see where I am right now in"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2493780","2498820"," the market. You can see that we've got a deadline up here. You can see we've got our 90 handles to"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2498820","2503860"," put on, right? You can see that we've been up for what, 16, 17 days, something insane like that."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2504500","2509220"," Right? So you start to look at the VIX. You start to compare the VIX to the"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2509220","2517460"," spine and it's extended. It's long on the tooth, right? What they say? So I'm looking for relief"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2517460","2522820"," down here to push up. I'm only day trade and what's in front of me each day. I've got this nice"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2523380","2529700"," protection on over here and I'll grab a long that's a month out if we get that relief. If not,"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2529700","2533220"," I'll trade. I'll day trade this bitch all the way to the top and I'll make"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2534260","2538580"," all that money. As a matter of fact, I'll put that fucking long trade on and then I'll day"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2538580","2543460"," trade it all the way up as well. So that's easy to do as well. So anyways, hope you all have a"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2543460","2549700"," great night. I wouldn't be too concerned into Friday. My thought would be with this OPEX that"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2549700","2552500"," they're going to try to pin it. If I had to guess, they're going to pin it between"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2553220","2560020"," 4650 and 4674. If I had to guess, they could possibly pin it 4699 to 4677."
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2560020","2564020"," They're going to pin it somewhere in here. You might even just bring it, keep it right here at this"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2564420","2569380"," 4674. And then as soon as they close all their shit, we could probably have a nice down day on"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2569380","2577060"," Monday and possibly where we just start ripping, right? So I don't really care if we have a down"
"TJlTQ4K-NEA","2577060","2583780"," day. I don't care if we rip all the way to all time new highs. I have my trading plan"
