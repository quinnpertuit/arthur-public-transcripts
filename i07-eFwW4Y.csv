"323540","324700"," All right, good morning traders."
"324920","325380"," Hold on a second. "
"325500","325580"," Okay."
"326260","327980"," We've got a sore through it this morning."
"329140","330480"," Just off the bell right here, right?"
"330680","331500"," We want to break above. "
"332800","335780"," I'm going to keep my talking to a minimum this morning at this point."
"335780","339680"," So we're breaking above this little red line right here."
"340080","349600"," We're not quite constructive yet, but we need to break above this pivot point here at 395 or"
"349600","350600"," 15. "
"351120","353000"," You need to see this break above."
"356100","364380"," And we're buying this morning, but the moment that we capture this pivot and then you want to stay"
"364380","364620"," above."
"364620","370640"," The moving averages as long as we stay above moving averages, you'll see some sort of consolidation"
"370640","372340"," in a trend higher. "
"373240","375560"," Now, if the bulls cannot do that today."
"376760","380240"," At any point, or at any point, not stay above the moving averages."
"380920","384080"," If we break below, here we see a different color here. "
"386260","389300"," So these moving averages as they come into play today, right?"
"389580","391300"," We will trade off of them."
"400530","401690"," Or below them."
"401790","402330"," Does that make sense?"
"403990","406250"," So you're going to see this happen. "
"406570","410630"," No, we could trade sideways, but the key here is if you're a bear."
"412730","416710"," Anything below these moving averages, you're going to see eventual selling at some point."
"417370","417470"," Okay. "
"417710","419550"," We're in a negative gam environment."
"419550","428490"," So the only way to trend up to have a snapback rally of any kind, you have to stay above"
"428490","429290"," these moving averages."
"430370","434530"," So you just stay watching the confluence of these moving averages today. "
"435150","437730"," And you'll see how this interacts over the coming days."
"439430","444650"," If you want to show examples of how this happens as the market begins to sell off this morning,"
"444790","445250"," just give me a minute."
"445250","448630"," Let me get the levels in and then we'll look at it again. "
"449510","452030"," And just let the market right now breathe and do its thing."

"532390","536970"," Then we are currently above moving averages right now, which is positive for the market to go"
"536970","537790"," higher today."
"543330","543950"," Hold on here."
"544070","546810"," I'm going to look at my positions here. "
"566320","566660"," Yeah."
"566840","567240"," So this is good."
"567340","568960"," I'm up right now. "
"568960","576020"," Yesterday, I started a position at 42 cents, I think, and then went back in at 70 something cents"

"579100","584520"," If you look closely at the options chain, there's 25,000 contracts on 395 C."
"586800","590900"," Yesterday at the close, I was telling you that there was like, I think someone was on a, I think"
"590900","592200"," there was a large position at 400."
"592200","598600"," And then I told you to expect that position to move higher, and you're seeing that this morning. "
"598800","602060"," So they've moved up from 400 C to 395 C."
"602820","606260"," I was talking to you yesterday about taking that position slightly higher."
"606860","611400"," One to four strikes outside of outside the money."
"611900","614100"," So 396's are fucking beautiful this morning. "
"614300","616480"," Congratulations if you're a fucking bull and bought that shit."
"617060","619780"," Don't hesitate to take some goddamn fucking profit right now."
"620240","621120"," Right where we are. "
"621120","621640"," Okay."
"621840","622840"," Take some money off the table."
"622840","623660"," A lot of few runners run. "
"624680","629520"," And if you took that trade into close yesterday, congrats your fucking lations."
"633760","635520"," I mean, we see what you guys are saying."
"637700","639620"," Oh, no, not, uh, not covert flu. "
"640200","644460"," When you talk all day long like that, and then of course, like trying to pump up the market last,"
"644700","646120"," or yesterday at four o'clock."
"646120","648100"," It's just the vocal cords get sore."
"648820","651080"," That's the only reason why I don't want to talk too much this morning. "
"652160","655400"," No, no, no, no, no sick."
"655540","655920"," No nothing."
"656200","657760"," Now $7 on those calls. "
"658660","659460"," Take somebody out."
"659540","660420"," I'm going to sell some right here."
"660740","662340"," Take some profit and leave some runners on. "
"662540","663460"," So it just heads up on that."
"664700","666000"," Yeah, nothing like that."
"666180","666840"," How are you guys doing?"
"669220","670360"," It doesn't matter to me. "
"670460","671040"," I have long COVID."
"671300","672140"," Yeah, no COVID."
"672900","678560"," Just more when you're talking all day long, repetitively repetitively, vocal cords can get sore. "
"681500","682400"," What are you guys here?"
"682780","684280"," I'm going to show you guys some right here."
"684760","686200"," We're going to go through some right now."
"687500","688320"," Hang tight here. "
"692180","693060"," Explain it to you."
"695340","696540"," Yeah, not muted this morning."
"696540","700360"," But me in a post on Twitter is born. "
"700740","704700"," My vocal cords are sore right now, so hang tight."
"705740","707080"," I'll show you guys some of this morning."
"707920","709720"," What I'm trying to explain to you, okay?"
"710900","713840"," If you're a bull, if you're a bear, it doesn't matter, okay?"
"715360","717640"," This is going to be a really quick explanation, okay?"
"718380","722500"," So people are always like, how do you know if we're going up or going down when we start to"
"722500","723880"," be able to sell off?"
"723880","725180"," This is for me to be honest for a minute. "
"727620","728360"," Hang tight here."
"729160","730260"," You don't have to worry about the levels."
"730500","733080"," You know where the resistance levels are. "
"733160","734420"," That's why you really need to know at this moment."
"735040","741640"," I want to show you so I can see that some of you guys don't know how to look for"
"741640","747080"," trends and when trend changes, okay?"
"749200","751340"," So first off, you see how we're tagging right now."
"751340","754420"," I want you to see this pivot point right here, okay?"
"757240","758160"," This is an intro. "
"758320","764340"," When I post a pivot point, it means that this is your intraday who's in charge, okay?"
"764440","765980"," It's the first thing you want to look at every single day."
"766240","769440"," So this pivot point right here, you can see we're pinging it right now, right?"
"769640","770060"," Is that pinging?"
"770860","775520"," And the first thing you're going to be looking for each day is if we trade to that pivot point,"
"775620","782540"," wherever it is, and then it's going to give you a kind of an idea of how we make sure"
"782540","783820"," you take some off at this point, okay?"
"784060","784600"," Take some profit."
"785200","787260"," When you buy zero dates, it's a directional move. "
"787900","788900"," I want you to understand that."
"789040","792080"," You can re-enter the trade again, but it's a directional move."
"792280","796580"," If you buy them, you pick the direction and you take profit, okay?"
"796800","801200"," You can re-enter the trade again if we go above the pivot point, but until then, this is a"
"801200","806180"," key indicator for you. "
"806180","808920"," Because this is the first thing you're looking for."
"809020","810400"," Are we trading above that pivot point?"
"810620","812120"," Are we trading below that pivot point?"
"812580","813160"," Does that make sense?"
"814600","816940"," That's your first key indicator for the day."
"817960","819180"," Hold on a second here. "
"821880","822360"," Okay."
"823840","830660"," It's critical that we should magnet to it on the opening bell every morning."
"831060","832740"," You can see we're pinging to it today. "
"832940","833920"," We did it yesterday."
"834300","836600"," It doesn't show on this chart right now, but we did."
"836600","838380"," It was like a hidden yesterday. "
"838440","844600"," It was here, but there was a hidden, like we actually attempted to go to the pivot, and then we"
"844600","845980"," sold right off of it yesterday."
"846300","848780"," It's not showing on this chart, but it did show up on the chart yesterday."
"849620","851660"," In most days, you should see that. "
"851820","857120"," Most days, you should see at least attempts to pivot or to trade to it, and then we'll make a"
"857120","858460"," decision on the market direction."
"858980","862220"," Now, we sold off right past few days here when selling off down."
"862220","867440"," I'm going to show you examples in the past so you guys can understand what I'm talking about with"
"867440","867940"," the moving averages. "
"869080","870740"," You see he's moving averages here, right?"
"872040","874060"," You see how we're selling off of it here?"
"875820","877100"," He's sold off of it here."
"878360","881840"," You see the moving averages are now underneath us."
"883000","889620"," We're above the moving averages right now. "
"889620","892680"," You'll see a trade higher."
"892960","897980"," If you see the moving averages stabilize and come sideways and we're still above it, you'll see"
"897980","898360"," consolidation."
"899320","902420"," If you see us start to break below, this is like the reactive trade, right?"
"903180","906180"," If you see these moving averages, we start to get below those moving averages. "
"907180","909980"," We're eventually going to start the continuation of selling off."
"910220","910660"," Does that make sense?"
"911160","912620"," I'll show you examples of this right now."
"914060","916240"," It's probably better to do a different color. "
"918600","926070"," You can see the blue and the green and the white right here."
"926190","929710"," You're going to use these as we've taken to the pivot point, right?"
"930370","936730"," You want to see if you're bullish on today or if you're like, oh, we're definitely going back up to"
"936730","937510"," see the crime."
"938390","948050"," We need to stay above these two return to see the crime or consolidate above for the move higher. "
"948970","954410"," If we break below and start to consolidate, you're going to actually see us start selling lower."
"954730","955130"," Does that make sense?"
"956190","958770"," I'll show you guys examples of this right now, okay?"
"961490","962630"," I'll give you just a second here."
"968350","969710"," That's probably not the best. "
"972860","973780"," I don't want to make a chart."
"973940","975460"," It'll show kind of similar, okay?"
"975860","978200"," So you see this is a two hour chart."
"978200","983000"," It doesn't really matter if it's like I can do a 15 minute chart or if you want. "
"990610","991770"," But you can see it right here."
"991930","992910"," It's a prime example."
"993070","995370"," And a woman in a chart will show up the same way. "
"996290","998250"," You get the initial sell down right here, right?"
"998870","1001010"," And you'll notice we'll come right back up into the moving averages."
"1002590","1019880"," Take a few days"
"1019880","1020820"," of selling down, right?"
"1021580","1022220"," Consolidation move."
"1023339","1024760"," We break above, right?"
"1025040","1025760"," You'll see that too. "
"1025760","1026720"," Even today, you'll see that."
"1026800","1028780"," If you break above, you're good to go to take along."
"1029540","1033420"," The moment we start breaking down through these moving averages, you will start to see selling"
"1033420","1033740"," down. "
"1034079","1036700"," Then you take control and you keep pushing it down, okay?"
"1038720","1041140"," Maybe I'll take some screenshots and show it to you in a one minute chart."
"1042560","1042800"," Think tight."
"1045720","1047420"," But if you're a bear, that's what you're looking for. "
"1049360","1050560"," You're looking at T off."
"1057330","1059710"," You're looking to T off on these moving averages."
"1062190","1063650"," There's no one minute chart right now, right?"
"1063750","1064930"," See the moving averages come in right here. "
"1068570","1070910"," As long as we stay above right here, right?"
"1071810","1075430"," You should start to see the market to head higher."
"1076370","1079210"," So you're going to use these moving averages."
"1080450","1081670"," Of course, you've got that resistance. "
"1082070","1083650"," This pivot point is not a good sign right here."
"1084170","1088310"," You'll see these moving averages come in right here, right?"
"1088830","1090530"," This is where the bulls are in charge."
"1091470","1097010"," Move up, down, up, down, three, usually a move higher. "
"1097650","1100610"," You want to take a trade off this, right?"
"1102410","1108410"," If you see consolidation off of these moving averages right here, you should at some point and move"
"1108410","1108730"," higher."
"1109210","1112670"," If the consolidation is too long, it'll turn distribution and start trading under."
"1113230","1115610"," This is where you put your stop losses in and then take a bear trade. "
"1116570","1116950"," Does that make sense?"
"1119190","1120050"," That's a bear trade."
"1121110","1121890"," God damn bears."
"1123030","1124570"," Does that make sense to you?"
"1124710","1133870"," This is how you're deciphering directional moves, especially in a negative game environment. "
"1135210","1136350"," You see that right here?"
"1139400","1140540"," This is the opening bell, right?"
"1142960","1144180"," What do they tell you here?"
"1144380","1145240"," I said, take profit."
"1145660","1146940"," So you take profit up here, right?"
"1147160","1147800"," Take your money and run."
"1148860","1151380"," If you're a bull and you're like, well, I'm still bullish here, Cap. "
"1151780","1152820"," You don't care what you're saying."
"1153440","1155040"," Or people in Twitter told me this."
"1155460","1156680"," People in Twitter told me that or whatever. "
"1157840","1161680"," Your next entry for a long would be off a reaction play."
"1162660","1163960"," Coming on the off here."
"1165420","1166420"," You'll be looking for that. "
"1166660","1167020"," How do you look?"
"1167120","1168700"," How do you enter a long trade here?"
"1169200","1170240"," You'll see us come down."
"1170880","1172240"," I'm going to change it over here."
"1174820","1176140"," You'll see us come down, right?"
"1176340","1179440"," You're going to want to see one, two, three, and then move higher. "
"1180380","1181940"," You're not going to enter the trade right here."
"1182880","1187340"," You're going to enter it on the first or second, maybe even the third bounce higher."
"1188860","1196520"," If you're a bear this morning, if you're a bear this morning, right?"
"1196600","1198580"," You're going to wait for the interaction here. "
"1199220","1201800"," You're going to be looking for some kind of failure below."
"1203060","1204540"," So you'll be waiting for this."
"1206160","1208480"," You'll be waiting for a failure down here. "
"1208960","1212280"," One, two, maybe even three, right?"
"1212520","1214360"," You want that resistance trapping bulls in here."
"1215220","1216160"," Then you take that move lower."
"1216320","1216800"," Does that make sense?"
"1218280","1220280"," The first, like, five, 15 minutes. "
"1221520","1224780"," This isn't going to tell you immediately off the open."
"1225400","1226380"," It's going to be a magnet."
"1227100","1229220"," But if we stay down below here, right?"
"1229440","1233040"," You see that rejection and you see continued rejection down here. "
"1233980","1236100"," You can forget about the VWAP to some extent."
"1236400","1238940"," You're trying to find out the trend for the day."
"1239060","1239460"," Does that make sense?"
"1240320","1243320"," If we start trying down here and you're like, oh shit, we're selling down. "
"1243680","1245600"," This is going to tell you right away trend for the day."
"1246060","1246940"," Does that make sense?"
"1247320","1248720"," We're consolidating and moving lower."
"1249440","1251260"," We're consolidating and moving higher. "
"1252140","1253800"," You guys understand all that out there?"
"1255040","1260120"," I'm hoping that you spend enough time with me to know that."
"1260460","1262540"," I told you not to buy that original, right?"
"1265810","1271190"," You're looking to see what the interaction is off of this confluence right here."
"1272910","1275470"," So just waiting to see what happens, the interaction. "
"1275470","1281490"," You've got big computers out there that are going to show you the way for you to make a decision"
"1281490","1285450"," as to where we're headed for the day and what your positioning should be."
"1287910","1289190"," I'm trying to see this right here."
"1289570","1292010"," If you're a bully, you're just going to sit here and wait. "
"1292550","1293090"," You took your profit."
"1293870","1298410"," You want to sit here and see if you get at least some kind of one, two, three bounce and"
"1298410","1299690"," off and running."
"1300470","1303790"," If you start to see this break below this confluence right here, right?"
"1304830","1306190"," Start grinding below it here. "
"1306390","1309190"," One, two, and then we start to pick a direction for the day."
"1310410","1314670"," Oftentimes your fine traders will tell you I don't trade the first five, 15 minutes or whatever you"
"1314670","1316610"," want to find out with the direction of the market."
"1317390","1323850"," You have a higher probability of making money each day finding out what the direction is for the"
"1323850","1328850"," day, which where we're going, and then you can go level to level and look for major supports below"
"1329390","1331070"," and major resistances above. "
"1332510","1334490"," Is that helping you guys this morning refbell?"
"1335170","1336170"," I don't know if people here."
"1339310","1345310"," Okay, so it's right here."
"1345370","1347410"," You can actually see it happening right now, right?"
"1348110","1352930"," If you want to see that, you get the one, two, three, and we'll start a continuation up. "
"1353530","1354910"," You've got R1 right here."
"1355250","1356530"," No, that's not R1."
"1356830","1359150"," Anyways, give me a minute here and I'll get the levels done for you. "
"1359150","1359770"," Give me just a second."
"1362350","1362970"," Good morning."
"1363110","1363990"," Hope you all are doing well this morning. "
"1366970","1367630"," Hold on here."
"1368570","1368930"," Okay."
"1370410","1374580"," I also note that we have more sellers than buyers this morning. "
"1377540","1378820"," So we've got a pinpoint."
"1379740","1381220"," R1, R2, R3."
"1381900","1383600"," This is the return to the crime kind of thing. "
"1384060","1385240"," Sometimes this can take a couple days too."
"1386040","1389120"," I was going to post this this morning and I didn't know how to put it to words."
"1389120","1393080"," You could see, I think yesterday it's the close. "
"1393280","1396700"," I was telling you guys that sometimes this takes time."
"1397140","1400700"," This can take like two, three days before it actually rockets up, right?"
"1401580","1403320"," We've got this area above his."
"1403600","1406140"," R1 is going to be major resistance. "
"1406400","1407800"," I want you guys to see that over here, okay?"
"1409600","1411580"," That's 398-70, okay?"
"1412540","1415820"," And then you've got this next level, this next short above up here."
"1415820","1419040"," That's a 4-350."
"1419720","1422460"," So major, R2, major, R1 up here. "
"1424060","1424540"," Okay."
"1425900","1428200"," Just some things to keep within."
"1431360","1433700"," It's an interaction up here in the five minute chart. "
"1434440","1434540"," All right."
"1434640","1435180"," Hold on a second here."
"1436620","1437700"," I'm talking again. "
"1438020","1439460"," I told myself I wouldn't talk this morning."
"1439720","1441700"," I'm like, I'm going to rest my volt cords."
"1443040","1444440"," I'm not doing that right now. "
"1445460","1446060"," Hold on."
"1479160","1483680"," One other note too is sometimes you'll hear bulls say, oh, we'll get out of S1."
"1484540","1486020"," S1 will test previous lows. "
"1486640","1488300"," I can put those in there for you."
"1488440","1490300"," They'll look for this as a jumping point."
"1494580","1495360"," You can. "
"1496200","1499780"," It can be very dangerous in a bearish environment."
"1503780","1504500"," Hold on here."
"1506700","1510020"," You'll often hear bulls say this, right?"
"1510140","1513720"," They're looking for at least a retest previous lows. "
"1514160","1515420"," I'm going to post those right here."
"1515500","1515880"," You see those?"
"1516060","1517560"," These are previous low right here."
"1518040","1519060"," A little bit of a load out here. "
"1519300","1522640"," Sometimes you'll hear a bull say, oh, yes."
"1522980","1525800"," We're going to at least expect some kind of a move down a retest to make sure."
"1526060","1526980"," Then we'll rock a chip up. "
"1527660","1532860"," This works too, but I'm telling you, that works in a supportive environment."
"1533680","1536540"," When we're in positive gamma, I would expect something like this."
"1536700","1538140"," You retest and then a move higher. "
"1538520","1540120"," It needs to be supportive the entire way up."
"1541100","1546320"," But in negative gamma, when you start coming down here, it can be very risky."
"1547040","1555680"," But I prefer to tee off the moving averages using this to move down to hit S1, right?"
"1556320","1556760"," Take profit. "
"1558060","1561340"," Break through and then a resumption down to S2."
"1561860","1565880"," Break through, pull back up and keep slamming those levels down."
"1568740","1571340"," These yellow lines right here are going to be your previous lows. "
"1571680","1573540"," You guys want to see where your real previous lows are?"
"1574220","1575120"," If we start getting bearish."
"1583740","1585180"," Start getting bearish, man."
"1585560","1587480"," Remember we were talking about this before?"
"1587980","1589160"," See this line right there?"
"1590640","1592500"," That's pretty crazy right there, right?"
"1593140","1595040"," This is your first support, 390. "
"1596540","1596980"," 32."
"1598640","1600320"," We can see where it is right here, right?"
"1601140","1601960"," So this is your S1."
"1602100","1604200"," This is your next previous low, right?"
"1604940","1606640"," And then beyond that, where's the next one?"
"1606960","1608380"," It's way down here. "
"1608520","1610360"," This is that gap that I was telling you about."
"1611520","1616700"," When I'm telling you, I was like, hey, we got a lot of room to do it down here."
"1616700","1619180"," A ton of room, right?"
"1619300","1621020"," Your next previous support is way down there. "
"1622740","1631220"," So if you're a bear and you want to see destructive moves lower, you want this S1 to break right"
"1631220","1631440"," here."
"1632140","1633880"," I can see a giant air gaps down here, okay?"
"1639310","1640230"," Excuse me a second there."
"1644040","1648080"," Bears like, I want to sell off that shit. "
"1648340","1649840"," I want it deep and low."
"1651180","1652680"," So bears have some work down here."
"1652800","1653740"," There is some support down here. "
"1653740","1654640"," I've got two previous lows."
"1655580","1658980"," S1 is kind of like the, we start selling down below S1."
"1659140","1660500"," It's going to get ugly. "
"1661060","1662520"," At any point, it'll get ugly down here."
"1664800","1666280"," I don't think we're going down."
"1666460","1670600"," I think we've got, I think we've got minimum of today to go up. "
"1671080","1675280"," One, two, three, and attempt to, if you guys want my bias, it's up."
"1676120","1682020"," So if anybody hasn't told you on Twitter or wherever, Facebook, Reddit, whatever, Stock Twits,"
"1684500","1688280"," we're going to, we're going to either consolidate or move higher, close in gaps above."
"1689760","1690520"," 3,680. "
"1692700","1696580"," Two out of my biases."
"1696580","1698120"," I don't know if you guys care about my bias."
"1701250","1701700"," Hold on. "
"1707210","1708390"," What is going on?"
"1711170","1712070"," There we go."
"1712610","1713130"," There's S2."
"1716210","1718190"," And then S3 is 381. "
"1718890","1720090"," Look at how low this goes."
"1723510","1724550"," This is the air gap."
"1726130","1726490"," 3197. "
"1732290","1736130"," I'm going to warn you, I'm going to tell you right now, okay, if you're a fucking bull, I'm going"
"1736130","1737250"," to tell you this right now, okay?"
"1737950","1742050"," If you're a fucking bull and you don't think you can come down here and blast through, I warn you,"
"1742290","1744270"," start breaking down below like S1 and stuff."
"1744810","1748490"," If we grind through S1 at any point, it's going to be fucking fast and furious down here."
"1748490","1749870"," It's like it's on. "
"1755320","1755960"," It's on."
"1756200","1759500"," Do not be listening to any bull up there."
"1760540","1766470"," If you're a bull, I want you to know for fact, okay?"
"1767570","1768630"," See this S1 right here?"
"1770110","1777210"," It's kind of like your, um, starts selling off down at any point, starts seeing any kind of fucking"
"1777210","1778070"," nonsense like this. "
"1778810","1781530"," Breaking down here and we start blasting through here."
"1781530","1786690"," These levels are going to, they're like, these levels down here are like, it's like a glass."
"1787070","1788970"," You're like, we'll see a glass floor right here. "
"1789290","1793870"," The moment this breaks, it's going to be, it should be super fast."
"1795130","1797150"," I don't think we're going down here, to be honest with you."
"1797790","1799030"," I don't think you're going down here today. "
"1799390","1802990"," I think you're going to, if you're bearish though, I think you're still going to see consolidation,"
"1803470","1804550"," then you'll get that move down."
"1805470","1810010"," This could take one to three days to Friday, maybe you might see a big sell off on Friday."
"1812170","1813650"," But, you know, you get what I'm saying. "
"1815290","1817870"," But if we stay below, he's moving average right here."
"1818050","1821110"," If we start staying below here, right, it's going to get nasty."
"1821650","1823110"," Right now we're not, right now we're consolidating. "
"1823250","1829230"," We just move up, coming back down, still making an decision on what we're doing for the day."
"1832820","1833720"," Hopefully you take profit."
"1836540","1837980"," Hopefully you heard me say take profit. "
"1838780","1840920"," He had those zero dates."
"1841440","1842300"," Hold on a second."
"1848380","1849340"," What's going on there?"
"1855470","1856610"," You've got a point. "
"1859330","1860250"," This means nothing here."
"1861470","1864650"," This one is 390, 32."
"1876780","1879440"," You can see this channel still working here. "
"1879580","1881000"," This is an important channel right here, right?"
"1881620","1885820"," This would be constructive for bulls if they can get above it."
"1886820","1889180"," Connect is like a temporary inter-day support."
"1889920","1892420"," More temporary inter-day support for the move higher. "
"1895100","1895920"," For bulls."
"1897580","1901060"," T knot, place the T off for the bears, right?"
"1901840","1903900"," I'll extend this down for you this morning as well."
"1904120","1905380"," So you may be trading here today. "
"1906360","1909040"," So we'll get that going for you too."
"1909040","1911900"," I'm getting tired here."
"1915170","1916490"," Vicious move down there. "
"1917630","1918110"," Insane."
"1921820","1923300"," I'll actually open this up for you."
"1934530","1938450"," And you can see just off the open, you can see that we're trading in here, right?"
"1941220","1941580"," Down. "
"1942940","1945020"," Tag it right back up."
"1945240","1946960"," The bears right back in charge again."
"1948580","1953440"," One, two, and three, possibly consolidation from move higher. "
"1954820","1957200"," Even possibly just trade in here today."
"1961640","1963900"," See the bears taking charge in here?"
"1964520","1966420"," The bears trying to maintain control here."
"1966820","1967700"," Moving averages right here. "
"1968220","1969100"," The bears are like, nope."
"1969540","1969760"," Fuck you."
"1969960","1970240"," Here's one. "
"1970480","1970820"," Here's two."
"1971540","1972380"," Then we're going to start heading lower."
"1977220","1978900"," Retesting these lows right now. "
"1985150","1988430"," And still have more sellers right now in the market still."
"1988570","1989830"," If you look at the dome."
"1990690","1999990"," I can still see where my cursor is over. "
"2000150","2002470"," You still see more sellers than buyers at the moment."
"2011390","2027480"," I think"
"2027480","2028740"," that works right there."
"2031140","2032980"," Let me check one more thing real quick. "
"2039980","2040860"," Yes, that's up."
"2045580","2047179"," This yellow, hold on a second here."
"2050239","2051120"," Clean this up. "
"2055239","2057000"," This yellow line right here, right?"
"2057139","2066760"," This is the, if there's still any bear or bulls out there."
"2067860","2075659"," Let me eat this one more time."
"2075880","2076500"," Hold on a second here. "
"2083340","2084860"," So if you are bullish."
"2088320","2089639"," Hold on, what happened there?"
"2091639","2092719"," If you are bullish."
"2094800","2095679"," Still bullish. "
"2097360","2100600"," You can't claim to be bullish until we break above here."
"2101600","2103000"," Do you want to see positive gamma?"
"2104800","2107060"," This is where I wrote previous channel."
"2107300","2110380"," I could tell you this is positive gamma or zero gamma. "
"2110680","2111760"," You call it zero gamma two."
"2112100","2114060"," This would be an attainable goal for bulls."
"2115160","2120400"," I wrote previous channel, but this yellow line right here is pretty much going to be your positive"
"2120400","2124460"," gamma and zero gamma or above it is positive gamma. "
"2125320","2128240"," Above it is going to be high volatility in here."
"2128660","2129360"," I want you to know that too."
"2129360","2134480"," High volatility here, zero gamma, positive gamma above, negative gamma below. "
"2136200","2143460"," If bulls want to, if we make this trade higher here, we'd make this trade higher tomorrow."
"2143840","2145860"," We'd make this trade higher on Friday, right?"
"2146840","2149160"," You should expect to fall in here."
"2151740","2158440"," And you wouldn't take a positive approach to the market. "
"2160040","2162460"," Until we're above it, if you're a bull."
"2163120","2164600"," Like cap bullish."
"2164940","2166260"," This is where you get bullish up here. "
"2167280","2170060"," Until then, you would see sell the rips until we get above."
"2170240","2171240"," This is this area right here."
"2172120","2175400"," So any kind of pushes up, you'd expect to get sold off. "
"2176140","2178160"," You'd expect this to get sold off."
"2179220","2180600"," You'd expect this to get sold off."
"2180600","2181100"," You'd expect this to get sold off. "
"2182800","2186460"," You would expect to buy a dip above this area right here."
"2186660","2187040"," Does that make sense?"
"2187040","2188720"," This is where we become supportive."
"2189440","2194800"," This is when you, if we came above here and it came down, you would actually buy this dip or"
"2194800","2195240"," move higher. "
"2196240","2199220"," Until then, the regime is bare."
"2200340","2203240"," That would mean that if we come up here, you would sell that rip."
"2204260","2205780"," I mean, if we come up here, you'd sell that rip. "
"2205980","2206340"," Does that make sense?"
"2206680","2208200"," If we come up here, you'd sell that rip."
"2209420","2211800"," You guys understand the concepts I'm talking to you about?"
"2212600","2215760"," If you're looking to buy a dip, it's going to be above."
"2216440","2217500"," This yellow line. "
"2217660","2219240"," I brought a previous channel."
"2219480","2221380"," I'm going to write zero gamma in here, okay?"
"2222380","2226420"," So you can know what the difference is between positive and negative gamma environment."
"2230860","2233140"," So I'll put zero gamma in. "
"2234820","2243060"," This will be a moving target as we trade."
"2243880","2245980"," You might have a different number from spot gamma."
"2246280","2247980"," I'm telling you that's what it is right there. "
"2247980","2251380"," I promise you that this is your zero gamma."
"2251780","2253100"," No matter what anyone's telling you."
"2253320","2255020"," Let's sell the rip until you get above there. "
"2262460","2263400"," Come on here."
"2264960","2265920"," Where's that yellow line?"
"2266940","2268380"," It's not showing on this chart now."
"2269360","2270420"," It was there and now it's not. "
"2273620","2276580"," It's somewhere between R1 and R2, somewhere in here."
"2277840","2281600"," Let me see if I put it on a five minute chart and see where it's right there."
"2284480","2285840"," Maybe I'll leave it on the five minute. "
"2286900","2288280"," You can actually just see it right there."
"2321830","2323690"," Or do you guys prefer it on a one minute chart maybe?"
"2325970","2327790"," I don't know what you prefer it on."
"2332640","2334080"," It's weird that it's not showing up. "
"2341720","2343580"," You can actually evenly see where it's at."
"2343740","2346340"," It's like 458 or something."
"2348160","2349700"," You're going to be chasing it all day long. "
"2379150","2380450"," It's actually a nice trade right there."
"2383410","2385570"," Already tagged the pivot point."
"2386230","2387130"," We'll see if we can break above. "
"2387970","2388590"," Break above."
"2389210","2389930"," Constructor for the bulls."
"2395940","2396540"," Good morning. "
"2396660","2397040"," How are y'all doing?"
"2397360","2397980"," Yeah, one minute chart."
"2398300","2398560"," No worries."
"2402760","2403820"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"2404760","2406120"," I can't believe you're all here this morning. "
"2413220","2414800"," Very constructive for the bulls."
"2415320","2418500"," Let the market open up."
"2418620","2419920"," You just get one touch right here. "
"2421040","2422060"," Two, three."
"2422700","2425180"," I'd be targeting R1."
"2426460","2427640"," It's a 39816. "
"2428120","2429700"," At least 39816."
"2470460","2472120"," Let's see if we can get this move higher here."
"2481120","2482240"," Take it more than all of you. "
"2497510","2500510"," Yeah, the 396s are now worth 63 cents."
"2500870","2502070"," I think we bought them at 42."
"2503150","2506030"," Then we wrote them up and then they came back down like 74. "
"2506730","2507970"," They're in the 90s for a minute."
"2508090","2509890"," It came back down like 85 and 74."
"2512610","2514070"," They're now at 60 cents. "
"2516890","2519490"," The options market's sitting on 300."
"2519490","2520570"," There's a $3.95 C."
"2522630","2523390"," Let's see here."
"2525590","2528470"," There's a matter of fact, they just got out of them. "
"2528870","2530630"," There's an algorithm that just took off all that."
"2530990","2532730"," They went to 390P."
"2534370","2539050"," They're trying to take us down here to at least right in here. "
"2540010","2544110"," Sometimes the puts will add market movement up though."
"2545030","2549050"," I'm not entirely sold on lower lows."
"2549790","2554250"," I wouldn't always trust where the positioning is on the market. "
"2554810","2556890"," 396 is now 47 cents."
"2559800","2562220"," Very key to watch these moving averages here."
"2562660","2567780"," Very key to let these moving averages pick a direction for the market for you. "
"2571480","2573720"," Just back and forth sideways right now."
"2575960","2576640"," Very key."
"2576760","2579580"," This whole area right here is very important for you. "
"2580700","2581920"," Bull or bear doesn't matter."
"2582080","2587800"," You want to pick a direction off of this or have some kind of a stop-loss here."
"2588000","2589600"," Let's say a bullish right now. "
"2589780","2591160"," Let's just talk about being a bullish right here."
"2592660","2598280"," So if you're bullish right here, you're going to be looking for one, two, three, move higher."
"2599660","2603820"," If you're going to buy some calls, you're going to say when the cheapest calls you can possibly get"
"2603820","2607760"," and I'm going to set some stops down here in case the trade goes against me. "
"2608340","2610580"," So you're looking for some kind of a break below here right?"
"2611220","2614120"," If you're a bull, say nope, I'm going to pull the plug, I'm going to start buying some puts."
"2614980","2615420"," Does that make sense?"
"2617680","2618760"," So as an example."
"2622420","2627020"," What would you expect us to go today if you're bullish?"
"2627460","2629720"," So you're going to start trading plan right?"
"2629720","2630680"," Like I'm bullish cap. "
"2631100","2634020"," You know that's there again is somewhere up in here right?"
"2636770","2639690"," So your target on day probably three ninety eight."
"2640450","2642570"," You're going to take a more of an in the money type call."
"2642790","2644150"," So three ninety five's maybe. "
"2645410","2647690"," You're going to have a stop somewhere down here."
"2647790","2649330"," You already know you already have a low down here."
"2650370","2655770"," So on a low, we're looking to grab some three ninety five's right to run them up. "
"2655970","2657450"," Maybe possibly three ninety sixes."
"2657450","2659770"," So they were cheap here for a minute."
"2659930","2660690"," They were like forty cents. "
"2661130","2662190"," Now they're fifty seven cents."
"2663830","2668290"," So one of these lows right here you'll end up doing is you'll buy them for as cheap as you"
"2668290","2669210"," can possibly get them."
"2669450","2670830"," They were forty cents here for a minute. "
"2672510","2673650"," See that right here one."
"2677250","2679370"," One two and three."
"2680610","2681970"," And this should be an explosive move here. "
"2682990","2684550"," This should be a giant move."
"2684670","2690350"," You should see some kind of a move on your first place to take profit."
"2690350","2692630"," It's going to be three ninety five thirteen blue or not. "
"2693070","2694130"," You'll see a move here."
"2694990","2696290"," You'll see consolidation."
"2697450","2701070"," You'll snap a line right here and then you're going to see a move right there. "
"2702510","2703270"," You got me."
"2706750","2708970"," And so we'll watch how this plays out."
"2708970","2712770"," But you should be thinking your entire trade through looking for these moves. "
"2713310","2714630"," Looking for the move higher."
"2714910","2721450"," If directionally when you're thinking this stuff out, you should be pre planning what you're doing"
"2721450","2721690"," here."
"2722190","2722690"," Does that make sense?"
"2723970","2728330"," If you're pre planning where the market's going right here and that doesn't go the way that you"
"2728330","2728850"," planned it. "
"2729710","2731770"," There's some fucked up in your planning."
"2731970","2732390"," Does that make sense?"
"2734690","2737110"," You should be always you should be."
"2737610","2739010"," If you can't do this. "
"2739530","2742690"," If you can't do this just in a thought process."
"2743250","2744770"," You shouldn't be trading with real money."
"2745070","2749970"," You should you should directionally have a plan of what you're doing and where we're going before"
"2749970","2750550"," it happens. "
"2751050","2752450"," There should not be any guesswork."
"2753950","2755810"," There should be no guesswork in what you're doing."
"2755950","2757710"," I don't know if that process is. "
"2758310","2762050"," So if you're asking yourself most days, I don't know where we're going."
"2762930","2763910"," You shouldn't be trading."
"2764930","2767770"," You should be just the thought process. "
"2768430","2773150"," Watch where the market goes after your thought process and see if that works out for you."
"2773710","2777750"," If it doesn't work out for you, you've got more work to do, right?"
"2777950","2781090"," You've got more more to learn to pick a directional bias."
"2783730","2793160"," This is also oftentimes where if you believe in the trend or you believe in your, if"
"2793160","2795440"," you believe in your positioning and what we're going. "
"2796540","2801520"," You know, let's say you have a small rip down and your directional bias is right."
"2802900","2804000"," It could take all day long."
"2804180","2804800"," It could take half a day. "
"2805960","2808640"," You want to always make sure that positioning though is correct, right?"
"2809520","2812120"," Or if you have this quick tip down that you'll buy your position."
"2812400","2818360"," You'll add to maybe add to your position and have even a lower, maybe even lower your stop losses"
"2818360","2823180"," so that you can build this is where you add and continue on with your thesis."
"2824880","2826180"," And when does your thesis break?"
"2827520","2829340"," You know, you can kind of see it right here, right?"
"2835120","2839520"," If you get a quick snap down and bounce this back up, you're like, hey, my thesis is safe and"
"2839520","2839920"," good to go. "
"2842810","2846230"," And the more you do this, the more you're going to be confident in your thesis."
"2846610","2848530"," And you're like, well, when is my thesis changed?"
"2852340","2859030"," The minute we start resisting, we find some resistance."
"2859130","2859490"," Fine. "
"2859710","2860530"," Let's sort of trade this."
"2861170","2862770"," Start seeing this move lower, right?"
"2862870","2867870"," You can then change your thesis and say, well, my thesis is a sound and it's just, it's not going"
"2867870","2868990"," the direction that I want to go in."
"2869090","2872690"," As soon as you start seeing moves like this down below, I know some of you out there are like,"
"2872750","2874250"," nope, I'm going to fucking diamond hand calls. "
"2875290","2880730"," If your thesis is sound and the market still reverses and goes the other way, you cut your losses"
"2880730","2881430"," down here, right?"
"2881430","2885890"," Three, four, stop, I'll say, nope, my thesis is what the sound, but it didn't happen, right?"
"2886310","2890250"," Cut your losses and then trade this direction and move lower."
"2895060","2896520"," Drop in knowledge this morning."
"2898600","2907350"," Yeah, let's look at, you guys want to look at TLT real quick. "
"2907590","2908570"," Let's talk about TLT."
"2912410","2914750"," No, I don't think it's done."
"2916350","2922950"," TLT is like trading with DIA. "
"2923670","2931790"," It will fucking, it moves, but if you take a position in DIA, if you take a position in TLT,"
"2932050","2936090"," it's a waiting game."
"2937790","2942130"," It's very similar to oil, oil stocks, especially energy stocks."
"2943070","2947310"," You're going to need to be awake at like four o'clock in the morning, take your profit, and then"
"2947310","2948350"," you re-enter that trade. "
"2948650","2956150"," Some people like to trade like 10.30 oil and gas news, but if you trade TLT, just like energy"
"2956150","2964310"," stocks, it's going to, it's a patience game."
"2965070","2966310"," It's a long ass trade."
"2968090","2969130"," So here we go. "
"2973970","2975250"," Click in the wrong one here."
"2975790","2979370"," Okay, so do you take profit here?"
"2979710","2980750"," Apps are fucking lutely."
"2983140","2988080"," But I want you to see this over a long period of time, okay?"
"2989940","2995500"," When you're talking about, let's say you take a position here, it's one, two, three, four days,"
"2995500","2996300"," right?"
"2997320","2999520"," And let's say like, oh, I want to re-enter that trade long, right?"
"2999920","3001160"," Let's say you just trade in the trend. "
"3002000","3002720"," You could be waiting."
"3002940","3003160"," Hold on."
"3003260","3008480"," One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine for that trade. "
"3009380","3010760"," Just re-enter it again."
"3012260","3014300"," These are trades that typically take time."
"3015540","3016780"," You know, again, right?"
"3016920","3018840"," You've got a move higher, right?"
"3019280","3019520"," Move lower. "
"3019680","3021040"," It's like a three day move right here."
"3021900","3022700"," One, two, three day higher."
"3023280","3023780"," Three days down. "
"3024740","3027560"," It was a three or four, five days consolidation move break back down."
"3027560","3029600"," And then it just keeps pumping."
"3030080","3037820"," So whenever I trade, whatever, I haven't traded TLT in a while, but whenever I have traded TLT, I'm"
"3037820","3040600"," talking about placing a position and coming back and check on it. "
"3042340","3043800"," We'll take a look at some stuff here."
"3043920","3053240"," We'll actually look at TLT over, uh, this is like TLT trends for, TLT trends for like, it's like,"
"3053240","3055560"," it's an epic trend."
"3055740","3057420"," I was going to call it like an epic trender. "
"3058280","3059960"," Um, you see this directional move."
"3059980","3061060"," How long this lasted?"
"3061540","3065600"," This is like 2018 to 2020."
"3066200","3068480"," This directional move down on TLT. "
"3068980","3070400"," We just look at how long it lasted."
"3073040","3078500"," Um, and I've got a, um, just the amount of time that it took and it traded in here."
"3080180","3089440"," So if, if you're a bull on TLT, let's see right here, right?"
"3090280","3092460"," Uh, we're coming into major resistance up here, right?"
"3093300","3094160"," On TLT. "
"3098820","3100220"," This bull trend here."
"3102060","3104600"," And I think the question, when you was asking, do you take profit?"
"3104880","3105860"," Fuck, yeah, you take profit."
"3106800","3108520"," Even a bunch of gaps below down here. "
"3109800","3115280"," Um, you're gonna, you're gonna expect even, even if the seller's a week, you're gonna expect"
"3115280","3116560"," sellers to come in, right?"
"3117480","3119560"," You're gonna expect sellers to come in here."
"3120320","3125320"," Um, this, I would assume there's standing orders of sellers above here."
"3127660","3137630"," So, what we're gonna do is, um, we know there are"
"3137630","3139510"," sellers that, sellers are 100%. "
"3140430","3142150"," Perfect place to sell TLT."
"3144330","3144930"," 110."
"3146310","3150410"," You're gonna expect, you're gonna expect, it doesn't matter if it breaks above, you're gonna expect"
"3150410","3151230"," sellers right here. "
"3152650","3153350"," Hands down."
"3154590","3155490"," I promise you."
"3156450","3164420"," It's at 108.93. How about bulls are just sitting up, or bears are sitting up here going, we're"
"3164420","3165600"," gonna smash the fuck out of this. "
"3167000","3172660"," Uh, so, and you've got, uh, some sellers sold down here."
"3172660","3191180"," Yep, they"
"3191180","3193280"," pushed up here, pushing up one more time."
"3194220","3195860"," You're gonna expect sellers to come in here. "
"3199030","3199570"," Excuse me."
"3201870","3203350"," You can see how it's playing out right now."
"3208700","3211820"," So, you're gonna expect these sellers to come in here and just start selling this down. "
"3212300","3213340"," But where does it roll over?"
"3213560","3214380"," Where do you find support?"
"3214720","3215700"," I guess it would be the next question."
"3217340","3219140"," And, uh, you're gonna be looking right here."
"3226260","3227340"," Push higher, right?"
"3228120","3228720"," Push higher. "
"3229600","3231920"," It's gonna be without even, I'm not even fucking looking at anything."
"3232060","3233660"," I'll just tell you right now."
"3234260","3237580"," It's gonna be, this is your S one. "
"3242560","3246660"," And a real time frame, like a, uh, on this where you buy it."
"3248000","3250900"," Um, first place is down here."
"3253860","3255760"," Push, push, zest two. "
"3265600","3272300"," We could draw like a, a yellow and a green bar in here in your own charting software."
"3272580","3274400"," And this is where the real support is right down here."
"3277160","3278120"," Somewhere down in there. "
"3280880","3282400"," It's kinda like your S three down here."
"3287330","3288470"," Where do you enter this trade?"
"3289150","3289650"," Down here."
"3290330","3291510"," That's where you enter this trade down here. "
"3294530","3295950"," So, you're gonna expect consolidation."
"3296330","3298110"," You're gonna expect, uh, sellers to come in."
"3298910","3300510"," And you'll be looking for some kind of consolidation. "
"3301590","3302710"," You already see the trend, right?"
"3304230","3306310"," And hopefully another attack above here."
"3307350","3312670"," Um, and maybe a moment where it slips down, uh, for another move higher."
"3314170","3316490"," Safest place to buy, 105, 102. "
"3322080","3324680"," Where do you start getting really bullish on TLT?"
"3324920","3326700"," Is breaking this right here."
"3327160","3328100"," Break out of this trend."
"3329100","3329980"," Shit is on. "
"3334760","3335680"," Shit is on."
"3336020","3340800"," I mean, you're talking about, talking about targets above, uh, right there."
"3344300","3345800"," Next target above, right there. "
"3346680","3347620"," Big giant moves."
"3348700","3350360"," Giant fucking trend moves."
"3350680","3351360"," It's next year. "
"3353000","3357580"," Uh, solo down."
"3358200","3359960"," Let's see, hopefully I'll solo down there."
"3361500","3361980"," Go on here. "
"3367900","3368800"," Right there."
"3369880","3373300"," If we start trending bullish, it's like, this is like catching us a knife, right?"
"3377570","3378870"," I hate catching those."
"3380030","3381010"," Somewhere in there. "
"3384190","3389270"," what would you expect over it would let's call it a year I so I've got this so I've got"
"3389270","3398850"," a I've got a algorithm for this I'm not going to show it here right now because it's a it"
"3398850","3403370"," has to prove itself when you catch and fall in knives like TLT you're"
"3403370","3413230"," looking for instructive move the real the real training"
"3413230","3420190"," there's a trade in here for TLT but if you want to get bullish on TLT it's not showing itself"
"3420190","3427410"," yet it needs to break this it has to break the downtrend it needs probably some large ass"
"3427410","3434710"," consolidation here this is March down here right and you would want to pick it up again you could"
"3434710","3440210"," you could buy the bottoms down here as it's becoming constructive if it's becoming constructive and"
"3440210","3448250"," then sell the rips down and you'd read actually retake this long for the rest of 2023 2023 if we"
"3448250","3454590"," go into some form of stag stagflation you would see something like this over the course of the year"
"3454590","3463030"," a lot of work to do in here very complicated work you'd be looking for you'd be looking to buy"
"3463030","3468790"," these lows down here at S3 this is a failure at any point down a real failure get out of"
"3468790","3478300"," that trade completely a lot of work to do in here does that help for does that help help you"
"3478300","3485480"," guys uh this is a patience trade too this could take you like a week a month sometimes to get"
"3485480","3492600"," down here to like 102 but I almost I'm not guaranteeing this but almost positively sure that you"
"3492600","3504090"," will get opportunities to buy on lows over here usually you will get a"

"4158010","4163050"," know it's all positive I don't like the selling right here I don't like that selling right there"
"4163050","4171510"," but still positive still above vwap just trading off vwap right now if uh there's more constructor"
"4171510","4177670"," for the bulls right now so if you want to know what I've got for what you know where we"
"4177670","4185550"," are right now you've got two rejections above if you start seeing more rejections like one two the"
"4185550","4193570"," bulls can't we're not in this isn't trend or it's not we're not in trend mode right now we're in"
"4193570","4201850"," consolidation mode this is right here um we are holding"
"4201850","4209990"," right see we're holding hair we're holding hair holding hair if we can't break through like the"
"4209990","4215090"," third time here we are going to head lower you only get you only get so many chances at it"
"4215090","4223310"," you don't get like five chances to go up uh point you know that too right if you see seller's"
"4223310","4229390"," hair seller's hair we're going to look for some for some more or better uh demand down below four"
"4229390","4236470"," uh push higher so you might see some weakness here for a moment uh you'll be using uh book map"
"4236470","4246270"," to look for that i'll put book back up for you and where's that low that's 3,900"
"4246270","4253970"," right so you'd be looking for some point at some for some weakness down here 3,900 is uh somewhere"
"4253970","4261030"," in here so you might see a moment where you dip lower looking for some demand so we can make"
"4261030","4268390"," it to the next level does that make sense well i can't see that i want you to see this"
"4268390","4275790"," right here okay so starting attempt to go higher we have told no right consolidation looking for"
"4275790","4283310"," buyers right next move higher and we're told nope you got nope sorry buddy not enough demand yet so"
"4283310","4293300"," what you'll sometimes see is this move lower looking for buyers if the buyers"
"4293300","4297300"," wind up being here right i'm going to go long i'm going to wait for to keep money smart money"
"4297300","4307160"," they call it right for another attempt higher if you get some fomo people here uh"
"4311160","4323080"," they will make it to the next level make sense because we already tried once we tried twice not"

"4868630","4874450"," fifty million you want to see like continuation of that trade if you only see like one but so if"
"4874450","4881310"," you see like one two point eight million dollar put that's more than likely a hedge on its own it'd"
"4881310","4886610"," be really wary i mean i have no no offense to cheddar flow either um or any of the flow"
"4886610","4893150"," services but uh they don't always interpret what's what it is that's coming out if you see just"
"4893150","4897710"," like a one two million dollar put a three million dollar put you don't see corresponding flow with"
"4897710","4908250"," it it's normally uh a position bullish in the market yeah"
"4913470","4922420"," you're right it's like hedge bingo exactly you're huffing all the hoping in the world that my tons"

"4980280","4989280"," make new highs right now trying to get above that point just trying to get above that pivot point"
"4989280","4992820"," so we can make a run the hour one aren't they look at that look at those dirty fucking bulls"
"5239240","5244040"," serious natural gas teachers turn negative in volatile trade off the rising five percent earlier in"
"5244040","5330900"," the session all right"
"5330900","5337440"," so we're going to do one more thing here i know there are bull or bears here that want to"
"5337440","5342280"," position for another short so we're going to talk about that right now we're quick for just a"
"5342280","5352230"," moment just briefly if you're looking for a target above here now"
"5352230","5357510"," we're coming into some resistance here you see this resistance here and how it matches up to book"
"5357510","5363870"," map you take your money here and re-enter above so if you're a bull i want i don't know"
"5363870","5369690"," how many guys have been with you for how long but uh so here's a nice trade higher right um"
"5369690","5376450"," you're going to consolidation or rejection phase one or the other and then under the leg higher so"
"5376450","5384630"," if you're trading level to level you'll be taking your money here and looking to re-enter so you'll"
"5384630","5391630"," be looking for a if you're at home and you're you've got a chart open or something you can see"
"5391630","5404520"," that that orange bar right there right so when i trade what i do is do"
"5404520","5408660"," something like this right just put a little red one orange box right here if you wanted if you"
"5408660","5416180"," didn't want to uh what you could do sometimes i'll just draw just a simple consolidation line see"
"5416180","5429300"," if this consolidates or if it breaks i'm looking to see what happens and"
"5429300","5433440"," i'd be looking to re-enter again because what they'll do is they'll grind your options down and you"
"5433440","5438940"," want to be you'll more than likely see something like this and move higher if we take too much time"
"5438940","5445240"," here we'll go back down again right we'll look for a grab off of these moving averages right so"
"5445240","5454440"," you're gonna be looking for one of two things either distribution down to get more support if the"
"5454440","5462600"," consolidation is is is a very small amount of time you will see a quick move up higher i don't"
"5462600","5465860"," know what your positioning is if you're taking like calls or a week out there you won't have as"
"5465860","5471900"," much grind on them if you're in zero dates or one dates you'll see more grind on them if you"
"5471900","5476120"," watch options change you'll see that happen right you might have an option that cost you 50 cents"
"5476120","5481840"," goes to 75 cents comes back down to even sometimes 40 cents depending on the amount of time that"
"5481840","5491720"," takes place so you'd like in directionally get out in directionally get out it makes sense"
"5491720","5497760"," in directionally get out SPX if you guys are trading SPX or i want you guys to know there's a"
"5497760","5509900"," tax advantage just trading SPX and also they're not as volatile as spy options so"
"5509900","5516420"," if any of you guys want less volatility you could buy either father dated spy contracts or you"
"5516420","5530930"," could trade SPX i'll"
"5530930","5533670"," leave this up for a minute because any of you guys want to be you guys are trying to watch"
"5533670","5551380"," this well"
"5551380","5555040"," man i'll tell you what we're still in a solar rip environment want to be careful be careful up here"
"5555040","5565560"," uh i mean there is a uh 397250 there's"
"5565560","5576740"," uh somewhere in here maybe a target up in here it's"
"5576740","5592860"," not too much higher 397250 is somewhere up in here here create"
"5592860","5602720"," 650 trans 7250 it's it's lower like great hold on here not too much"
"5602720","5609780"," higher um just let's see be careful up here there could be some bulls or some this could be a"
"5609780","5619680"," bull trap there's not a lot above here there's not so i want you if you guys are looking"
"5619680","5627880"," at um book map book maps not showing like a target above here it could we could step up and"

"6124850","6130950"," good question what let's talk about that so uh Sharaf uh Met is saying do we go long on on"
"6130950","6139430"," spy no uh and that's this is ultimately i meant to talk about this earlier hold on i said for"
"6139430","6145090"," the bears so we'll we'll we'll do the bear trader um so no matter anyone tells you out there i"
"6145090","6153450"," can assure you i was asking a phone call last night uh are you bears for bullish here like truly"
"6153450","6161350"," are you bullish and bearish i was trying to relate to him the only bull case left or if you"
"6161350","6165490"," were if you were to have a bull case here and they don't do a sector rotation and start blasting"
"6165490","6175320"," this market down slowly once they have supply um it was a month chart right here"
"6175320","6184160"," right if you want to get bullish you need to first reclaim all of this right here and get back"
"6184160","6193920"," into positive gamma oh here it gets something going on you can't even so"
"6193920","6200020"," i'm willing to entertain the bull case but uh for me to put a bull suit on need to reclaim"
"6200020","6209700"," a move higher another another um way for the bulls to have the bull case would be consolidation"
"6209700","6219260"," and some sort of continuation so it doesn't have to be this channel it can be a channel down here"
"6219260","6227580"," right so if you're so if the bulls want some if you want a bull case you'd have to have"
"6227580","6236440"," some kind of sideways and up and then a break still still a break above uh zero gamma right so"
"6236440","6241140"," it doesn't matter if you trade sideways then goes up then you take the bull case but right now"
"6241140","6248420"," there's no bull case so uh question then becomes if you're a bear where do you want to take uh"
"6248420","6252540"," a short of the market because you should have your bulls your bear suit on you shouldn't have your"
"6252540","6258040"," bull suit on this morning like or like a over a timeline let's say that's two weeks or a month"
"6258040","6263800"," out you shouldn't um a timeline that's three months out right now you should have a bear suit on"
"6263800","6268340"," like the bears are in charge right now uh i want you to know that you have to know that"
"6268340","6273760"," um so i asked the question do we get to r1 or r2 today and i said we get to"
"6273760","6278520"," r1 why am i saying that i was saying that because if if you're a bear you kind of want"
"6278520","6286500"," to see uh or have a place to to sell you can already see that's happening you can see bears"
"6286500","6293800"," are entering into that cell right now you see this pivot point right here for my or my uh cursors"
"6293800","6297720"," right here you're going to have bears entering right here you know fuck it you're going to have was"
"6297720","6302000"," you you're going to have bulls trying to get unfucked here and you're also going to get some bears"
"6302000","6308640"," they're going to say i don't care we're going back down taking a put spread right here you're going"
"6308640","6312200"," to get bears that are going to be like nope this is where the smart money bears are going to"
"6312200","6316940"," be they're going to be up here we can see them right on we can see them right on the"
"6316940","6321280"," uh book map right they're right there just right and jump back right back in so you've got smart"
"6321280","6325740"," money bears above saying this is where i'm heading and then you've got like the really cheap bears"
"6325740","6333460"," and they're probably up here at r3 r2 r3 what they're saying is no no no i don't look the"
"6333460","6337600"," bulls get back in here they'll feel safe and then we're just going to slam it right back down again"
"6337600","6343320"," so you've got like three levels here and i want you to know that these three places there are"
"6343320","6352100"," fucking bears waiting just waiting not to continue to sell this market i warn you of that okay that"
"6352100","6361820"," uh we're we're bearish and until uh bulls can get constructive get above this"
"6361820","6367940"," zero gamma where these these are the nastiest bears right here if if these sellers are weak yeah"
"6367940","6372500"," you'll seek some consolidation and then this continuation this is where we put the bull head on"
"6372500","6381380"," right so we're we have a bullish stance there we have a bearish stance bull stance below but if"
"6381380","6389840"," anyone out there is telling you you have to be bearish in here so even if we trade a pyre"
"6389840","6395040"," here today your ultimate what are you thinking so what what's your thought process on an intraday"
"6395040","6404300"," you would say you'd say i'm bullish on intraday but only for me to find or already have a"
"6404300","6413300"," predetermined place to sell the market right so so you would say i'm bearish but i don't want to be"
"6413300","6418240"," i don't want to be buying puts here i want to be buying them up here or up here uh"
"6418240","6423760"," or even hot or even higher whether i showed you in that five-minute chart so if you're bearish or"
"6423760","6428240"," if you're speaking to somebody and they're like what are you right now you can be like hey i'm"
"6428240","6433480"," bullish right now and but i'm just waiting for us to get to a certain level for me to fucking"
"6433480","6440000"," sell this shit you'll see bears say i don't care i'm just going to start selling this right here"
"6440880","6448580"," i'm going to sell everything here until it fails so it starts bloodbath and down but i assure you"
"6448580","6456800"," that we are or you should be wearing a a bear suit and just waiting for your for wherever you"

"6489980","6496560"," looking for positioning uh weekly looking for positioning monthly looking for positioning uh if you"
"6496560","6502980"," guys want to know where this ends we're like if we stay bearish where does it end we know where"
"6502980","6509400"," it ends right oh it's what what's where the market becomes oversold they'll sell this until it's"
"6509400","6514800"," oversold and we have ways to go we know that there are sectors that didn't have it even started"
"6514800","6521480"," selling it so we know that some that we know there's tech pools out there that are just parking"

"6628310","6635730"," nice to see this is constructive for the bulls you see how we have these lows down here this is"
"6635730","6640350"," where you want to be buying the market when we're down here uh this doesn't you know the best part"
"6640350","6646950"," about this is it doesn't matter what the price is so uh if you're like well take cap how far"

"6656840","6663440"," here uh i'll start getting bullish again it makes sense and right now we're not there right now we"
"6663440","6686520"," are um we are right here this is"
"6686520","6691560"," currently where we are right now kind of like a neutral place right uh where do you want to buy"
"6691560","6696560"," a dip or get stuck in bullish again you want you want this red line to come down here right"
"6696560","6706560"," into this green zone and the deeper it goes the more bullish you should be getting right"
"6706560","6710900"," you can see it right here right you can see watch my cursor right here you see this right here"
"6712020","6718640"," see that you can buy that you can buy that right there so it makes sense you can buy that"
"6718640","6723560"," right there so it makes sense you can buy that right in there you probably get fucked up in here"
"6723560","6729820"," but uh we'll talk about that later about getting fucked up in a uh position it's like see right"
"6729820","6735640"," here like i what if i'd bought this cap what if i'd bought this cap what if i'd bought this"
"6735640","6743600"," cap now you can put time on those trades right there see right there's nice little bottom it's over"
"6743600","6751080"," the course of a year and see one right there see one right there and once we get down here"
"6751080","6755160"," then you like looking and saying well what what needs to get sold i'll tell you exactly what needs"
"6755160","6764040"," to get sold utilities you want to put a short of the fucking market utilities i think this is"
"6764040","6771520"," consumer uh i think this is i forget what the CNS is but i think it's consumer staples i think"
"6771520","6780680"," this is staples hasn't been sold the fuck down yet so um so you know what hold on i'll put"

"6788890","6798030"," bulls have uh bulls have a um man you know what so see right here"
"6798030","6806270"," we had something similar happen before you're probably going to see at some point uh we'll trade"
"6806270","6813360"," down and then this is like the fake this is the bull trap right here uh you get that pump"
"6813360","6819820"," up and so it fails then we continue down you can see where that where that is like right there"
"6819820","6827020"," and then we started bloodbath and it down again you're gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna make a prediction"
"6827020","6836720"," to you how about this you want a prediction i'm betting you that uh i'll bet you that you'll see"
"6836720","6846180"," this PPO come down you'll see us come down right about there uh you'll see the s&p 500 let's"
"6846180","6854520"," go to 3820 is my right now but give you a bunch of targets 3820 got a target on s "
"6854520","6862280","&p 500 in the in the near term next week or two uh i would expect us to bleed off"
"6862280","6870020"," into into FMC that's going to be my expectation have a price target of 3820 that's true that's"
"6870020","6878220"," legit i bet that when we're at 3820 we're going to be right about here and it's going to be"
"6878220","6886380"," teed up for FOMC to then start bloodbathing it down or to rip higher bulls are going to make a"
"6886380","6890140"," case for this too they're going to say the breath is down you're going to say the PPO is kind"
"6890140","6896260"," of ready um and if we do get that if we do get that continuation here and the breath is"
"6896260","6904960"," down uh that we could get that 4300 and 4400 uh right i won't get that off 3380 we could"
"6904960","6914600"," we'll we'll trade up there absolutely um so let's put your next target is 3820 um"
"6914600","6923080"," from there uh depending upon what the uh what the FMC says upper target 430 lower target uh won't i"
"6923080","6929760"," won't know that here but we could do a measured uh met we could do a measured move i'll figure"
"6929760","6936400"," it i'll do a measured move for you later but you'd be uh you guys want the measured move uh"
"6936400","6944800"," we could do a fib we could do a fib we what does i want to say there"
"6944800","6955850"," time cycles no we just do a fucking let's do a price range so"
"6955850","6969420"," there uh 3264"
"6973160","6980600"," that's what it is 3264 so i'm going to tell you right now that i'm going to expect us to"
"6980600","6989200"," trade down to 3820 into news of or an event of some kind you're going to see us uh either"
"6989200","6998620"," trade to 4300 or 3264 from there does that make sense it rub in and around there that would be"
"6998620","7008420"," the uh that would be my guess trading down on the bottom of the key right now"
"7008420","7020170"," so um if you guys want to look at a uh does that help for price targets so"
"7020170","7025890"," on a longer time frame we can you look at excel you real quick you're going to see the the"
"7025890","7034840"," pitfalls are going to try to buy this right now there's a trying to step in right now if you"
"7034840","7044720"," look on uh look map here and there's going to try to uh trap bulls"

"7215090","7222570"," to re-enter the trade right here, slam money, maybe a little pullback, then something like that. "
"7224590","7227090"," Actually, this would actually turn into the next sell."
"7228750","7230830"," So you can just get rid of this right here."

"7291570","7293490"," Sellers have stepped in for the second leg down. "
"7294010","7296690"," They're going to look to target 3,900 down below here."
"7299970","7302450"," So how does that translate for you, is there?"
"7305930","7307970"," Remember we said there's sellers hiding up here?"
"7308530","7310370"," Came in, they sold it right down, right?"
"7310890","7312310"," Slammed on the moving averages."
"7313170","7314450"," We're now bearish, right?"
"7315610","7316950"," Sold it below the moving averages. "
"7317310","7320930"," Now that they're under the moving averages, the bears are trying to attack to take this down to 3 "
"7320930","7321210",",900."
"7323410","7328340"," I just can't see that, I don't think."
"7331120","7331900"," I'm going to meet this. "
"7335000","7336300"," You can see it right here, right?"
"7336420","7337480"," It's the moving averages right here."
"7339400","7342180"," V-Wops right here, right?"
"7342820","7345620"," And we knew there's sellers up here hiding, right?"
"7345700","7346860"," We said there's sellers up in here."
"7347420","7348540"," They sold it down successfully. "
"7349180","7353100"," They took it right to the moving averages, right?"
"7353100","7357940"," V-Wop, sold it down underneath V-Wop, top of the key right here."
"7358460","7360280"," And now they're going to try to slam it down."
"7362680","7364060"," Nice bear trade, by the way. "
"7367420","7368980"," Where is the price target from here?"
"7371000","7373640"," We know it's down here where the smart money is right here."
"7375620","7378940"," We know the bears are going to push it down here, or attempt to at least."
"7381260","7386880"," So just keeping an eye on the markets overall with the stock market, so stocks can't seem to find"
"7386880","7392160"," solid ground with the treasury market signaling growing bets on an economic downturn amid"
"7392160","7394080"," restrictive federal reserve policy. "
"7395280","7400280"," You also have traders weighing comments from Putin, who stopped short of pledging not to use with"
"7400280","7406000"," nuclear weapons first in the conflict, saying Russia's arsenal is a deterrent factor in conflicts,"
"7406000","7410600"," warning that the threat of nuclear war in the world is rising."
"7411100","7416260"," Putin reiterated that Russia will defend itself and it's allies with all means if necessary."
"7417160","7422000"," Other than that, it hasn't been anything else in regards to headlines. "
"7424000","7430240"," City's Fraser, Jane Fraser, CEO, saying we're in recession in Europe already, and there is some"
"7430240","7431640"," soft thing in the US economy."
"7435020","7436820"," Yeah, this said no news day, right?"
"7438020","7439420"," So we knew that coming in today."
"7439520","7440720"," It's very sponsored by Ticksright. "
"7441340","7442560"," Ticksright allows you to."
"7442680","7444060"," Beer on beer, beer back."
"7444340","7445700"," It's for X and stock insurance. "
"7445800","7447660"," Rubber bands on bull balls."
"7448960","7449960"," You guys are hilarious."
"7450340","7453840"," Fraser says the US recession is likely in the second half of next year. "
"7455920","7458080"," Yeah, the smart money to buy is down here."
"7458580","7459920"," I'd buy this down here in a minute."
"7462800","7464860"," Intraday traders are going to trade this area, right?"
"7466140","7467400"," Like boiler room traders. "
"7467780","7471240"," They're just buying in here, selling in here, buying in here, selling in here."
"7472260","7473700"," Smart money is down below."
"7474480","7475980"," Smart money is down here to buy. "
"7476500","7478580"," You're just standing there going, please give me a, let me get in."
"7478700","7486400"," Let me buy some of this on a larger timeframe for, you know, the way is down."
"7486720","7487400"," I want you to know that. "
"7487400","7491000"," I want you to know if you're out there that the fucking way is down to 3820."
"7492060","7493060"," I promise you."
"7494000","7494800"," That's the way down. "
"7494980","7498500"," Like the next week, two weeks into FMC."
"7499560","7500520"," The way is down."
"7501880","7502540"," I promise you. "
"7509110","7511570"," D.A.P. is saying Captain James first day in your ship."
"7511770","7512710"," Thanks for being a wise captain."
"7513830","7516190"," What do you think Spy will hit a 380 before the beer?"
"7516490","7518910"," Oh, no, I think it'll hit 380 like this week or next week. "
"7518910","7524210"," Like, like next five days, next five sessions."
"7524990","7528650"," Maybe six or maybe, you know, it might not actually hit 3820."
"7529250","7533690"," It might just, it'll, it'll be close. "
"7535810","7536630"," It'll be close."
"7539030","7540910"," Oh, no, no, no, no."
"7541010","7541110"," Yeah. "
"7541470","7543010"," So someone's saying no."
"7543110","7545690"," So no hope for 400 end of month."
"7546210","7546930"," Santa is dead. "
"7546930","7548430"," No, Santa's not dead."
"7548990","7549890"," I just went through that."
"7549990","7551130"," You guys didn't see that?"
"7551330","7551970"," I just had the chart. "
"7552150","7552770"," I've shown you that."
"7554370","7556870"," I just showed you my expectations."
"7557410","7558090"," You guys, are you guys?"
"7558290","7560930"," You're out there listening to me right now, right?"
"7561170","7562870"," Stop anything you're doing unless you're in a trade. "
"7564270","7566510"," And I want you to fucking watch what I just said."
"7568270","7569810"," Okay, so we'll do it again."
"7572410","7573330"," We'll do it live. "
"7576050","7579650"," So it's a pretty fairly easy way to predict this stuff."
"7579890","7582550"," It's not, we're not trying to complicate stuff here."
"7582710","7582790"," Okay. "
"7583470","7584970"," We're going to watch my cursor over here."
"7586910","7589890"," You can see all these sectors within the S&P 500, right?"
"7591610","7594030"," So accumulation distribution, right?"
"7594470","7595730"," We're going to talk about accumulation distribution."
"7597050","7599710"," So bulls bought the market down here. "
"7600170","7600370"," Okay."
"7601870","7606420"," So they're just simple."
"7607360","7608760"," Bulls bought the market down here. "
"7608940","7609060"," Okay."
"7610000","7611800"," And now they're going to take profit."
"7612580","7614860"," They have some signals to take profit, right?"
"7614960","7615640"," We broke trend. "
"7616360","7620380"," So bulls are going to say, oh, I'm just going to take the money off the tail and look for"
"7620380","7621840"," a place to buy the market again."
"7622940","7623600"," Logical, right?"
"7623960","7625820"," I don't care what the overall trend of the market is."
"7625820","7629620"," I just care that I can find an entry into the market and then I can sell for profit. "
"7630340","7637100"," This is like the logic of how you make money, how you really make money in the stock market."
"7638580","7640800"," And so as a bull, you should be bullish."
"7641160","7648440"," As a town, if you're out, sometimes you can trade better as a bear, but you'll make more money,"
"7648620","7653800"," even if you're a bear over time, at least knowing where the market's going to get bought, knowing"
"7653800","7655800"," how long the market's going to be held for. "
"7657960","7660540"," And especially if you're a bull, like where do I buy cap?"
"7662560","7663700"," That kind of stuff, right?"
"7663940","7666660"," So, and there are basic ways to find out."
"7668020","7669620"," Oversold and overbought conditions."
"7674520","7677940"," Our places that you buy and sell the market, the trend doesn't matter. "
"7678560","7679500"," I want you to know that, okay?"
"7679700","7680460"," See this chart right here?"
"7680560","7680980"," I want you to see this."
"7683520","7684780"," That didn't matter here."
"7685340","7685940"," Didn't matter here. "
"7685940","7692760"," These kind of moves over the years mean nothing as a bull."
"7693620","7700280"," I guess to some extent, you could make an argument, hey, cap, I only want to buy and hold for"
"7700280","7702080"," a year or two and not have to worry about it."
"7702220","7702920"," That I can understand. "
"7703760","7707720"," But even though even there, even then there's places, you can see them, right?"
"7707920","7708500"," There's one right there."
"7708640","7709380"," There's one right there."
"7709960","7711300"," There's one right there. "
"7712040","7713720"," Big one right there, right?"
"7713720","7718800"," Even in a bull market, you can find the places to buy the market, right?"
"7719440","7719880"," You can see them."
"7721440","7721920"," See them?"
"7723440","7726820"," I don't know if you guys can see that, but you can see, and you can see this just showing"
"7726820","7730060"," relative strength as well, the market going up."
"7730260","7733460"," So, like, even in this bull run, if you were listening to somebody saying, we're going to have a"
"7733460","7734360"," market crash in here. "
"7734480","7735240"," We're going to have a market crash in here."
"7735240","7735480"," We're going to have a market crash in here."
"7735560","7738560"," You could easily see that we were in an uptrend, right?"
"7739100","7742320"," Our lows weren't giant chasms, right?"
"7743260","7744520"," These giant chasms. "
"7745480","7746520"," You can trade this."
"7747760","7749500"," You could fucking buy this."
"7750480","7754620"," I've back tested this 30 years at this point, I think. "
"7755680","7761040"," And you, if you put the right trade on, you'll never fucking, it doesn't matter if you even have a"
"7761040","7761800"," stock market crash."
"7762740","7767900"," You'll actually, if you're just buying stock or select the S&P 500, you can't lose money."
"7768920","7770360"," Ever, like, ever. "
"7771180","7775880"," So, I know people tried to disagree with that, but I've back tested this fucking 30 years."
"7776580","7780640"," So, anyways, my point though is this."
"7782480","7786240"," Someone's saying, so we're not getting, someone just said, so you're saying we're not getting 4 "
"7786240","7786660",",000. "
"7787120","7791260"," No, what I'm saying to you is that you're going to expect, you can see right here."
"7792080","7795900"," See what I bought, and you're starting to see us sell right here, right?"
"7795900","7796960"," There's no traffic, believe it or not."
"7797120","7798480"," There's no trap bulls out there. "
"7799180","7802560"," I hear that on Twitter all the time, like, there's no fucking trap bulls here."
"7803080","7804300"," Fucking bulls bought down here."
"7804480","7805140"," You can see it. "
"7805500","7806760"," There's data proving it."
"7807360","7808360"," They bought down here."
"7809260","7810560"," There's no trap bulls right now. "
"7811640","7814100"," They're selling for profit and taking the money and running."
"7815320","7816620"," Be aware of that, okay?"
"7817280","7821020"," There's signals here telling you as a bull, it's time to take your money."
"7821020","7823480"," We have no more continuation right now. "
"7823760","7826820"," Take your money and now start to look for an inflection point."
"7827540","7829240"," So, what would that inflection point be?"
"7830200","7835420"," Me as a bull, I'm looking for some breath to go down, right?"
"7835660","7836800"," To come back to a buy zone."
"7837520","7841120"," I'm also looking at sectors and I'm saying, okay, what have they whacked so far?"
"7841540","7844180"," Well, they've whacked the industrials, right?"
"7844560","7847440"," Looks this looks like, I think this is a tech got whacked. "
"7848920","7851540"," There's some fucking bulls hanging out in utilities."
"7851840","7852700"," They haven't sold yet."
"7853320","7855980"," So, I'm going to, my real key right now that I'm looking for is utilities. "
"7855980","7858680"," It's going to be a signal for me to re-enter the market."
"7859300","7864300"," Once utility sells off, I could probably guess that we're going to, you'll start to see a ramp in"
"7864300","7866420"," an accumulation in other sectors, right?"
"7869340","7871460"," And I'm looking at the price that we're at right now."
"7871540","7873800"," I know we're at, our lower level is another 100 points lower. "
"7873800","7875900"," I know the spot can go lower, right?"
"7877420","7882020"," So, I'm looking for, I'm looking for breath to come down."
"7884100","7885040"," This is market breath."
"7886220","7889220"," And the price per cent of oscillator is actually kind of showing you, right?"
"7890900","7892680"," And you see this trend down, right?"
"7892860","7895720"," Even though we're green up here, the same thing's happening right now. "
"7895900","7896320"," You can see it."
"7896960","7898640"," You can see the purple bars down here."
"7901640","7902660"," See it right there, right?"
"7903300","7906280"," So, if you're a bull, you're looking for an inflection point, right?"
"7906900","7908440"," You're looking for this to come down right here. "
"7910580","7913740"," And where's the next major level lower, right?"
"7913940","7914820"," Is 38020."
"7915520","7917820"," We know already we looked yesterday on yesterday's stream."
"7918920","7920180"," There's a big giant gap down there. "
"7920460","7921620"," Easy for us to sell down there."
"7921940","7922700"," No, no worries."
"7922900","7926280"," I'd almost guarantee that you'd see us trade down here. "
"7927480","7929520"," And you'd see us hit this mark right here."
"7930420","7932460"," So, an inflection point, 3820."
"7933100","7935940"," That's what I'm just going to put that out there for myself as a bull. "
"7936740","7938620"," And say, I'm going to say to myself, I'm going to say, okay."
"7939260","7942800"," So, I might not hit there, but that's what I'm going to say, right?"
"7943360","7944580"," I'm looking for like 3820."
"7946360","7948820"," And I'm going to watch this monitor where we are here. "
"7950100","7951740"," See if it corresponds, if it doesn't."
"7952460","7954920"," Let's say I put 3020 down here."
"7956680","7957220"," Right there. "
"7958760","7960060"," And we'll get rid of this."
"7962440","7964700"," So, this is my price target right here, 3820."
"7965540","7968580"," Now, let's say we start selling off and we're not at 3820. "
"7968720","7969920"," Let's say we're at like 3850."
"7970280","7972140"," And I've got some puts on right now, right?"
"7974260","7975140"," For 3820."
"7975480","7976640"," And we're heading down towards it. "
"7976720","7977800"," We're heading down towards it."
"7978560","7982400"," Let's say we're like only right here, but the breath is low, right?"
"7983840","7985520"," And let's say we're right here."
"7988040","7991700"," And let's say we're only at like 3840, 384. "
"7992600","7996740"," This would be a time for me, even though I have a target of 3820."
"7997000","7999560"," It would be time for me to take some profit and say, you know what?"
"7999620","8000600"," I'm going to take some off the table."
"8001260","8005020"," I targeted 3820, but you know, the breath in the market is kind of getting down there. "
"8005600","8007940"," And the risk is now coming into my short position."
"8008360","8010300"," So, I'll pull my short off, right?"
"8010820","8013940"," Take my profit and look to see what the interaction is here."
"8013940","8017620"," And I'm also looking for some kind of news event around here, right?"
"8018440","8019300"," Like magically. "
"8019620","8020700"," You guys ever noticed magically?"
"8021380","8023160"," You see something like this happen."
"8023280","8024400"," This is predicting the future, right?"
"8024980","8028040"," And shockingly, there'll be a news event when this happens."
"8028220","8029980"," I promise you, there'll be like an FOMC. "
"8030260","8031580"," There'll be some fucking CPI."
"8032140","8033880"," There'll be some kind of nonsense."
"8035020","8039560"," And shockingly, you'll be at this price point when we come into that news. "
"8040300","8048280"," Now, if we were, if we had traded higher into that FOMC or that OPEC or not OPEC, CPI, print"
"8048280","8050000"," or something like, have we traded high into that?"
"8050880","8055880"," I'd be, I would be expecting bad news to come from that event for us to sell."
"8056680","8064460"," So when we head into FOMC and CPI, I am going to expect good news because we sold down into"
"8064460","8064560"," it."
"8064740","8065620"," Does it always happen?"
"8065980","8066100"," No. "
"8066100","8073260"," I would rely upon that indicator, though, way more than anything, a nonsense I hear on Twitter,"
"8073960","8075520"," especially if it gets really bearish."
"8076560","8080460"," If it gets really bullish and we're trading down into it, I'd be, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I don't"
"8080460","8081280"," like that trade either."
"8081440","8088260"," I prefer that if we're like trading down into an event that the company of, of chatter is bearish. "
"8089100","8093400"," The more chatter of bearish, the more trading down into an event, the more bullish I get."
"8093400","8098620"," If people are bullish into that event and we're trading down into it, I'm probably going to take a"
"8098620","8100580"," neutral stance or even a bearish stance."
"8101680","8102980"," So that's what I'm looking for. "
"8103100","8106560"," I'm looking for this into OPEC now or into FOMC."
"8106660","8112980"," I'm looking for that trade down into FOMC and for an inflection point for, for a bull."
"8113180","8116180"," So let's say we head down here, slam down here. "
"8116280","8123260"," It's fucking, or it's a December fucking 14th, 13th and they're waiting for the decision, right?"
"8124300","8128060"," This would be where I'm going to start to think about taking a long or short."
"8128240","8133160"," If you're, if you're not a great trader or can't pick a direction, there's no need for you to worry"
"8133160","8133640"," about it."
"8134640","8135280"," Are we go?"
"8135480","8139320"," Is there a chance to go to 400 again cap or 430 abs to fucking lately?"
"8139840","8141080"," You don't even have to be in a position. "
"8141140","8148440"," You could go right into, you could go right into the decision, the FOMC and wait for their"
"8148440","8148820"," decision."
"8148820","8154180"," And you already know if the market's positive or more than likely heading back up here, like 420,"
"8154700","8154740"," 430."
"8155460","8161800"," You already know that if the, if the decision is, is going to be hawkish, where's your next level,"
"8161800","8162060"," right?"
"8162300","8163360"," So you're like, where's the next level?"
"8163560","8168600"," If I'm bearish at 3820 and we're at the, and we're at the event, right?"
"8168840","8171620"," At the FOMC meeting, you can measure that move. "
"8172020","8172220"," It's easy."
"8172820","8174040"," At least have some kind of an idea."
"8174520","8176060"," We already measured it earlier this morning. "
"8176060","8178860"," That we got a number of three, two, or three, was it?"
"8179000","8183840"," 32, 64, I think we measured for continuation down, right?"
"8184080","8185260"," That's just like right here."
"8185760","8186580"," Does that make sense?"
"8187220","8192139"," So the full move, 100% down from the top of the key right here is 32, I believe, 32,"
"8192320","8193000"," 32, 60."
"8193660","8195780"," So you've got, I just gave you like three price targets. "
"8199540","8206040"," 3820, a decision, and then a move higher to 420, let's say, or a move lower to 30."
"8206040","8206799"," 32, 64."
"8207379","8208100"," Does that make sense?"
"8208799","8210400"," It makes life pretty fucking easy. "
"8212879","8217080"," It makes life very, very simple for your stances."
"8217600","8218860"," Like, this is what I'm looking for."
"8218980","8220920"," This is why I'm being a bear. "
"8221100","8222080"," This is why I'm being a bull."
"8222860","8224620"," These are the prices that I'm looking for."
"8224719","8228980"," This is the time frame that I'm looking in to get there. "
"8229240","8232940"," This is now looking, so I'm going to bullish there, or bearish stance right now, right?"
"8232940","8236100"," Where do I want to position myself as a bear to get there?"
"8236520","8239680"," Do I want to start selling at zero gamma up here?"
"8240059","8241580"," Do I want to sell at our one up here?"
"8242240","8244219"," Do I want to just start fucking laying it on?"
"8244660","8246680"," Do you guys understand what I'm saying?"
"8254959","8258459"," So someone's asking me now, is that the move that you're calling for for CPI?"
"8258900","8259540"," That's my stance."
"8260000","8262020"," That's my stance for into CPI."
"8262680","8262760"," Absolutely. "
"8262760","8263440"," Absolutely."
"8267410","8272299"," See, if you're sitting here, I think tight."
"8273520","8276260"," So you're sitting here over the course of a month, right?"
"8277600","8280420"," Look at a month, right?"
"8281240","8281860"," What's trend?"
"8282799","8283799"," Trend is up, right?"
"8284580","8287040"," Until trend is broken, I'm bullish, right?"
"8289280","8292879"," If trend is broken, which it was, right?"
"8294059","8295740"," So you've got right here. "
"8295980","8296740"," Hold on a second here."
"8297459","8306799"," So if you were a bear since October, or the heel of bear, when"
"8306799","8310660"," I say heel, if you're trading this, right?"
"8312940","8315820"," You didn't get any confirmation we were breaking trend in here, did you?"
"8316020","8316900"," You had no confirmation."
"8317900","8319879"," We didn't break down in here, did we?"
"8321520","8323780"," We didn't break down in here, did we?"
"8325160","8327180"," We didn't break down in here, did we?"
"8329180","8331219"," I'll show you where we broke down, right here. "
"8333480","8334639"," That's where we broke down."
"8335080","8338520"," So once you see this breakdown in here, what is this telling you?"
"8338940","8342660"," It's telling you to put the fucking bear so we've broken trend."
"8343540","8347059"," Where do we trade down to in here, right?"
"8347980","8349379"," Where is the next logical place?"
"8349379","8353860"," We already looked at the market profile. "
"8354120","8356059"," There's a giant fucking gap in here."
"8356940","8359040"," Giant gap, right?"
"8359180","8360200"," You get S3 down below."
"8360400","8362020"," This is STXL down here, right?"
"8362740","8363780"," STX buy is down here. "
"8364600","8365719"," This is your buy signal."
"8366440","8369080"," 31, 82, right here."
"8369639","8373700"," Shockingly, I'm giving you these levels, right?"
"8373879","8379020"," They're telling you, hey, the dealers are telling you, are trading ranges here?"
"8380420","8382240"," And this is where the expected move is. "
"8382860","8385740"," We know we've got OPEC's next week, or not OPEC's."
"8385820","8388960"," We've got an FMC coming up on the 14th over here."
"8389640","8391500"," I think it's rational to say we go down here. "
"8392120","8395260"," I can see that there's still big money hiding in utilities."
"8396160","8398740"," I'm looking in sectors that are still fat as fuck right now."
"8399880","8401100"," And they haven't been liquidated. "
"8401920","8403280"," They need to get liquidated."
"8403620","8404600"," So yeah, that's my bias."
"8405480","8406820"," I'm gonna bear stance. "
"8406820","8408800"," No reason for me not to be in a bear stance here."
"8408880","8413260"," It's absolutely logical that I would be in a bear stance down here."
"8413840","8419660"," It was absolutely logical that I would be in a bull stance here, right?"
"8419920","8422260"," Made a lot of money like this. "
"8423080","8425560"," Should make a lot of money like this on the way down."
"8427140","8432000"," And this will likely fall into, this is going to, we're going to likely trade down."
"8432520","8434860"," We might not get this 38, 20. "
"8435460","8440020"," We're going to watch some other indicators to see if we get there, but that's my target, right?"
"8440140","8440660"," That's my stance."
"8440680","8441840"," I'm looking forward to happen."
"8443560","8449300"," I need a bunch of bears though to think we're going even lower before then so we can actually get"
"8449300","8450060"," some. "
"8450120","8451000"," There's a whole other thing."
"8451100","8454760"," This is about buying puts and calls and do we actually get to that price target?"
"8454980","8456160"," I don't care if we actually do though."
"8457040","8459620"," I just kind of make progress down here heading into next week. "
"8461020","8465320"," If I'm in that bear position, I'm just going to, I'll take the money and run depending on when that"
"8465320","8466460"," next big event is."
"8466580","8473300"," We know it's CPI in the 13th and we know that it's FOMC in the 14th."
"8474560","8475140"," I don't care. "
"8475320","8478540"," I don't care about money or like the price where it winds up."
"8478680","8485460"," Do we actually get 38, 20 caps like do I fucking care as long as I'm fucking short into that"
"8485460","8487420"," event and the market selling off."
"8487420","8490760"," And I can watch breath in the market. "
"8490780","8491680"," I don't care."
"8491880","8492380"," Just making money."
"8496280","8497300"," You guys know what I'm saying?"
"8499040","8500520"," You guys feeling me here?"
"8502680","8509520"," And if you want me to put the bull's suit back on, I have no reason to put a bull's"
"8509520","8513140"," suit back on until positive gamma is regained. "
"8513700","8514280"," I have no reason."
"8514660","8515560"," You shouldn't die there."
"8516200","8520320"," You should have no reason to be like I'm bullish here cap. "
"8520820","8522580"," And I'll be honest, this trade higher."
"8524040","8529960"," So this this trade higher, if let's say you're, you're like the top bottom collar and you're like,"
"8530060","8531300"," oh yeah, I called it."
"8531300","8534920"," And we traded all the way up here and we held zero gamma. "
"8535220","8541880"," I assure you, I assure you that if you made this trade or this call or this shot collar as"
"8541880","8544740"," a bear or shot collar as a bull, right?"
"8545300","8547840"," And you actually trade this that you'll fail."
"8547840","8549020"," You can see it."
"8549140","8557310"," You can see it over the past month that when you're in trend, you would have gotten smoked in here. "
"8557450","8558410"," You would have gotten smoked here."
"8558510","8559210"," You would have gotten smoked here."
"8560670","8562010"," You would have gotten smoked here. "
"8562030","8562090"," You would have gotten smoked here."
"8562090","8563070"," You would have gotten smoked here."
"8563210","8563530"," You would have gotten smoked here. "
"8563530","8564170"," You would have gotten smoked here."
"8565270","8566010"," You know what I'm saying?"
"8566330","8567030"," It's going to roll cap."
"8567250","8567850"," It's going to roll cap. "
"8568030","8568670"," It's going to roll cap."
"8568890","8569430"," It's going to roll cap."
"8569610","8570230"," It's going to roll cap. "
"8570530","8573130"," You can say that, but you can't take that trade until you get confirmation."
"8573930","8575890"," Right now you've got confirmation that we're going down."
"8575890","8582170"," So you trade this as we're going down until we have a trend reversal. "
"8583030","8587710"," So if you're a bull and you're like in bull's hair cap, okay, that's fine, but you're not going to"
"8587710","8590470"," take a bull's trade until you get back into a trend this way."
"8590950","8597430"," Or you get back into a trend this way and break above zero gamma or positive gamma."
"8597710","8599690"," This is when you'd be like, all right, cap now. "
"8599790","8600750"," I'm a bullish man."
"8600870","8601290"," We're going up."
"8602230","8604450"," And I would buy your dips right along with you. "
"8604530","8605030"," Does that make sense?"
"8607070","8609390"," Right now you're bearish."
"8610430","8613550"," You're a trader and investor out there telling you."
"8615330","8616690"," This will serve you. "
"8616970","8621110"," This will serve you making money for the rest of your career in the stock market."
"8626050","8627670"," This will serve you well."
"8628670","8631210"," You'll beat the market more times than you'll ever lose the market. "
"8634930","8635610"," Hands down."
"8635790","8636850"," You'll beat the market."
"8637090","8637630"," I promise you. "
"8643770","8644170"," Yeah."
"8644290","8645170"," I want to sell that up here."
"8645310","8646690"," See this seller's hiding right here. "
"8647390","8647830"," It came."
"8647990","8649190"," They swooped right in up here."
"8651810","8652890"," They swooped right up here. "
"8652970","8653410"," Right up in here."
"8653490","8653890"," They didn't even care."
"8654670","8655730"," They were just sitting right here hiding. "
"8657170","8657910"," They are up here."
"8658270","8658950"," They are up here."
"8659110","8659690"," Sellers right here. "
"8659990","8660630"," Sellers right here."
"8661530","8662650"," Sellers getting more aggressive."
"8663170","8663890"," Sellers right here. "
"8664450","8665870"," Sellers came back in today."
"8666530","8667410"," All of this is indicative."
"8667410","8668510"," Selling the market. "
"8669370","8670170"," No change."
"8677110","8677710"," No change."
"8678050","8679210"," They sold it down from right here. "
"8679430","8680450"," They were hiding right up here."
"8681130","8681990"," And they'll do it again."
"8682570","8684570"," They're going to do it to you again and again and again. "
"8688490","8690950"," They're going to do it to you again until the market breath."
"8691430","8694570"," They're going to do it to you again and again and again and again until the market breath either"
"8694570","8702150"," becomes oversold or there's some news that we don't know."
"8702150","8705290"," Some kind of unknown positive news for the bulls. "
"8705630","8709390"," And they're just going to keep selling it until we're in oversold conditions."
"8709590","8714390"," Once we're in oversold conditions, they'll pull the shorts off and they'll let the market breathe"
"8714390","8714710"," again."
"8715650","8716230"," Make sense?"
"8718130","8719170"," Hey, Mario, how are you?"
"8720810","8722430"," This fucking group does rock. "
"8725330","8727350"," This group does fucking rock."
"8733300","8739940"," I'm telling you, as a trader, right, as a dipfire, as a bull, as a bear, if you can learn"
"8739940","8744600"," those concepts, right, and you can trade with those concepts as a bull or a bear."
"8745960","8748760"," If you're like, I only do well selling the market cap. "
"8751540","8752900"," We saw it happen."
"8753320","8756040"," We watched it happen two days ago, right?"
"8756580","8758980"," We were like, hey, we lost the pivot today."
"8759440","8760800"," We didn't get a new higher high. "
"8760840","8761820"," We didn't get a new higher high."
"8762340","8763340"," We lost the pivot."
"8764340","8769560"," Then we lost the 200 and we lost positive gain when it's negative gamma, right?"
"8769960","8773840"," So you're like adding all these things up and you start to say if you're a bull, you're like, man,"
"8773840","8774360"," you know what?"
"8774580","8775760"," Time to start taking some money off the table. "
"8776080","8777280"," If you trade like this, right?"
"8778380","8782500"," If you trade like this, you're going to be able to sell the market with confidence."
"8782720","8784620"," You're going to buy the market with confidence."
"8784620","8787360"," You might have one bad trade out of ten. "
"8788500","8791180"," You're not going to be listening to people that are telling you otherwise."
"8792160","8797640"," When we were at that last bottom in October, I had fucking people all on my ass."
"8799300","8803140"," I had people commenting in my stream like, you're crazy buying this. "
"8803680","8804760"," I have that every time we're at a bottom."
"8805400","8808660"," Right now, more than likely, there's probably bull saying you're crazy selling this."
"8811100","8819000"," As soon as the mechanics are met on the bottoms and tops, you can usually take those with some kind"
"8819000","8819440"," of confidence. "
"8820200","8824140"," You can look at a breath indicator regardless of where the market goes."
"8824800","8828320"," So if the fucking market's trading down over two years, the fucking market's trading up for five"
"8828320","8830200"," years, you're just using the breath indicator."
"8831560","8837300"," The breath indicator does not care about the ups and downs of the markets. "
"8839460","8840680"," Does that make sense?"
"8844370","8845150"," That's right."
"8845350","8846490"," Vescrano is exactly what's up."
"8851030","8852530"," Vescrano is exactly what's up. "
"8857860","8860340"," Your trading journey will become easier."
"8862960","8868380"," Your journey of calmness becomes a lot easier."
"8868380","8878190"," If you have a top"
"8878190","8882370"," or bottom of a channel and the breath indicator is a pretty solid risk. "
"8882930","8890710"," Yeah, I've been back testing this for so like my large money trades are fairly"
"8890710","8895550"," used with that kind of prediction model."
"8897230","8899470"," And they print, man."
"8899690","8900270"," They fucking print. "
"8900650","8901870"," They print nine times out of ten."
"8903370","8908330"," If you want to go into size in a trade, usually the most oversold conditions, you can usually buy"
"8908330","8909910"," that regardless of where price is."
"8911630","8912110"," Regardless. "
"8912530","8919670"," And if you put it on with time on it or in actual owning stock, your time horizon for making"
"8919670","8920010"," money."
"8921270","8923990"," Three months, max, four months, three months."
"8923990","8926750"," I think the widest I've had to wait is three months. "
"8929190","8929850"," Roughly in there."
"8930050","8936090"," So even if you're just buying stock for the shares, even if you get a market bloodbath collapse,"
"8937050","8940930"," that shit would get bought up in the next three months and come right back to where you started."
"8942410","8952660"," Yeah, so"
"8952660","8957460"," GP eight zero zero eight is saying, I agree on everything, but don't you think that PPI. "
"8958080","8960660"," CPI FOMC or potentially major upside move triggers."
"8960960","8961040"," Yeah."
"8961260","8962960"," I don't. "
"8963080","8969980"," So when I look at the way that I view news is different than a lot of what the cacophony"
"8969980","8971620"," of news is out there."
"8971620","8976920"," I can show you where we've sold into or we've bought every FOMC, not every, I think it's like seven"
"8976920","8979640"," out of ten of the last FOMC's we've bought."
"8980420","8983280"," And I think we've sold seven out of the last 10 minutes. "
"8985060","8989020"," You can see we're selling the minute or they were selling the main meeting right now, right?"
"8990420","8993720"," I'd be a more confident in the bullish narrative."
"8995020","9000640"," If we're able to sell down into into FOMC, I would if we were able to sell down at 3820"
"9000640","9001320"," into FOMC."
"9002480","9008120"," I can already I can already look and see that there's a inflection point for bulls to have a move"
"9008120","9008440"," higher. "
"9009720","9010140"," Right."
"9010340","9012820"," If we sold into so let me show you this."
"9013120","9017840"," You guys when you guys hear people say like good news is good news bad news is bad news and"
"9017840","9020440"," all of a sudden good news is bad news and bad news. "
"9020440","9025880"," DCB is often paid dispute to hold talks about potential strike according to financial times."
"9026760","9028240"," So you'll hear people say that."
"9029380","9030960"," And that's all about market breadth. "
"9033000","9034400"," That's all about market breadth."
"9034980","9035740"," There's no real set."
"9036080","9039280"," They're using the news to sell the market or buy the market. "
"9039740","9043000"," When the reality is the breadth is oversold or overbought."
"9044900","9049280"," You can do this on different timeframes one day, five days month year."

"9071180","9073500"," What's used that you like all you read that you like."
"9074180","9078000"," Like I'll see like the market sell off and I'm like I'm like what are they using for news today"
"9078000","9078980"," for selling the market off."
"9079760","9086220"," And they're like to like the market is the market is you know awaiting this decision or the market"
"9086220","9086680"," is. "
"9087180","9090620"," They write at least like it's stupid articles and then you just look at it some other indicators"
"9090620","9092620"," and you're like oh yeah we're we're we're we're bought right now."
"9093440","9094860"," That's actually the reason we're we're."
"9112220","9115280"," Yeah that's going to say and he thinks that we consolidate make the bones higher. "
"9121300","9122060"," One here."
"9125440","9132100"," Well that was my expectation is the move down and pick yesterday at the close we're talking about."
"9135220","9136840"," This is Friday right here. "
"9140660","9142080"," This Monday right here."
"9142900","9145740"," You'd likely see between now and Monday."
"9146360","9151680"," A move to I think it's our one right here. "
"9156780","9158400"," And then a resumption down."
"9160660","9162100"," Something like that."
"9179410","9185190"," I think we're talking about putting on call spreads for Friday or Monday expiry in the money. "
"9198320","9200940"," Eight oh eight eight zero zero eight is boob cap."
"9203080","9210980"," If you trade some crypto for a while then go back to equates you'll become more zen."
"9229660","9233100"," Yeah Christian saying news accelerates action to support. "
"9236110","9240250"," Of course or supply and demand levels doesn't change them."
"9240250","9241030"," Yeah it doesn't."
"9241710","9243770"," Like news is a weird fucking thing when you're like. "
"9245690","9253270"," You know what else is cool about news is when there's when there's breaking news that the market"
"9253270","9255670"," doesn't know like the banks don't know."
"9257090","9260790"," You almost always see mean reverse or your version back."
"9262430","9263670"," So if like a."
"9266350","9268710"," And it doesn't matter if it's positive or negative. "
"9271110","9274870"," If you have something that the market does not have priced in quote unquote."
"9276090","9279270"," Either positive or negative you will almost always."
"9280390","9283850"," See the price or return to its original price. "
"9284950","9285810"," Almost always."
"9286870","9290190"," And it can continue higher from there or lower."
"9291270","9294490"," But you'll almost always see that happen. "
"9297090","9298370"," Almost every time."
"9301550","9305430"," Hey investment I'm going to be in Utah for."
"9306850","9307650"," Sundance. "
"9309490","9312950"," I went skiing last weekend and now I'm."
"9312950","9316510"," I think I'll be there the 19th weekend of the 19th."
"9317770","9321810"," It's like Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Monday I don't want to stay the whole week. "
"9322090","9323310"," Or I think it's like a two week."
"9324270","9327450"," Thing but every time I go I feel like the second half of it is kind of."
"9328170","9330750"," An afterthought I like going to when it starts because. "
"9331470","9332670"," No one's on the mountain."
"9333770","9335510"," Everyone's like in town partying and stuff."
"9335970","9338330"," It's like the skiing is fucking phenomenal. "
"9339390","9340790"," There's no skiers there."
"9341530","9343290"," Everybody's focused on the film festival."
"9344190","9348390"," So I was going to ski that weekend for like three or four days and then spend my night. "
"9352320","9356740"," Trying to sneak into very small concerts and shit like that."
"9366670","9368230"," You'll see crazy things like."
"9371950","9376090"," If you see like positive news you'll see like an initial spike up then it'll come back down. "
"9376250","9379670"," And then if the news is real it'll start to trade into that direction."
"9381070","9382550"," Same I'm saying my bad news."
"9390030","9391690"," Bill's saying buy the dips and get rich. "
"9392450","9393290"," Yeah you know like."
"9398570","9399610"," It doesn't really."
"9403490","9413160"," When you hear things like buy the dips and get"
"9413160","9413980"," rich like. "
"9418300","9419780"," There's a time to buy the dips."
"9421340","9422680"," There's a time to sell the rips."
"9428090","9429450"," Normally it's positive gamma. "
"9429730","9432250"," As long as we stay above positive gamma you'll see volatility get lower."
"9433010","9434230"," You'll see every pricing of the VIX."
"9436050","9437610"," That's the time to buy the dip. "
"9438830","9439630"," In a screen by the dip."
"9446590","9448110"," Spy 450 by New Year's right."
"9448970","9449130"," No. "
"9450010","9450250"," Sorry Bill."
"9451290","9451790"," Maybe."
"9453130","9454590"," It's not saying that right now. "
"9462600","9468100"," It's got a magnet down below book maps showing a magnet down below at thirty nine thirty nine"
"9468100","9468460"," hundred."
"9470300","9471780"," Smart money is down below."
"9472400","9474700"," I'll show you that right here so you can see it. "
"9496660","9498700"," HYG and small caps relative strength today."
"9499060","9500080"," Nothing more than consolidation."
"9502760","9504180"," In a larger time frame. "
"9505220","9507460"," You'd expect to have at least a rip higher to sell into."
"9514580","9522540"," You can sell like HYG and J&K."
"9522920","9526180"," The reason I watch them is sometimes you'll see divergences. "
"9526180","9527740"," It's a good question."
"9528080","9529220"," Let's talk about that real quick."
"9531180","9533420"," Let me see if I can do an overlay over here. "
"9533500","9534260"," I'll show you what I'm talking about."
"9536400","9537320"," Hold on."
"9537780","9538300"," Great question. "
"9538680","9539680"," We'll do it right now."
"9539860","9540000"," Hold on."
"9543600","9546700"," Another simple trading of like HYG. "
"9548580","9549560"," Like why do you."
"9549940","9554460"," You might ask the question like why do you care about H."
"9554460","9556980"," Okay so get your pencil and paper out."
"9557220","9557420"," Ready?"
"9558020","9559040"," I'll tell you something very simple. "
"9559260","9561820"," You don't have to complicate things."
"9561900","9562520"," Make it really simple."
"9565280","9569980"," You'll see like bond traders and you'll see bond guys who's complicated language. "
"9570820","9573400"," You'll see them talking ways that you don't understand."
"9574080","9575220"," You'll see people trying to correlate."
"9577480","9579520"," Make rocket science up for you. "
"9579640","9580280"," If you're an equities trader."
"9581440","9584260"," You'll hear people say bond market knows better than you do."
"9588160","9592180"," And there's only as an equity trader the dumber you the dumber you trade the better you usually"
"9592180","9592480"," are. "
"9592720","9595760"," You have to have like some simple rules and you follow them."
"9596040","9603400"," So if you're a new trader just get a piece of paper and get a note pad on your computer."
"9603740","9605340"," I want to make it real simple for you. "
"9605340","9605520"," Okay."
"9610700","9613320"," If T.L.T. is going up right."
"9614500","9615640"," It's showing that. "
"9619280","9621400"," Buyers let's go try to make simple for you."
"9621540","9625380"," So it means that buyers don't want to make risky bets."
"9627900","9632820"," So they're putting it in their bond and well when so if I'm going to buy bonds right. "
"9635540","9638720"," If I'm like I have to make I put money to work out there in the market."
"9638720","9643560"," So if I'm putting my money into T.L.T. if T.L.T. is going up."
"9644940","9645380"," Right. "
"9646500","9648740"," And H.Y.G. and J.N.K.R. not."
"9650460","9654260"," Right that means that I don't that I don't have faith and risk your bets."
"9654740","9655140"," Makes sense. "
"9655480","9656740"," This is making something simple."
"9659730","9663570"," If T.L.T. is flat to down and you start to see."
"9665710","9668030"," J.N.K.R.H.Y.G. going up. "
"9668210","9670590"," That means that I'm putting risk on in a risk trade."
"9671350","9671730"," I'm saying."
"9672330","9676870"," Yeah these are risky bets right junk bonds high yield growth bonds. "
"9678050","9679590"," You start seeing that going up."
"9680410","9683810"," It implies that I'm willing to take more risk in the market."
"9684550","9685630"," Bond market right. "
"9688840","9692920"," In turn the equity market should go up if you see."
"9693660","9696900"," H.Y.G. and J.N.K. Go up."
"9697500","9699260"," And that doesn't always happen. "
"9700640","9705220"," Now like the saying of the bond traders and the bond market is smarter than you."
"9705480","9707140"," Or just the bond market is smarter than you."
"9707800","9711320"," And they plan more measures against Russia's energy and mining sector. "
"9712100","9716160"," And they and that market can tell you something about what to expect sometimes."
"9717340","9718200"," In the equity market."
"9718760","9720300"," But they're talking about as a divergence. "
"9721460","9722020"," Sometimes."
"9722320","9723920"," It's very missponsored by Ticksright."
"9724420","9728840"," Ticksright allows you to actually hear water flowing futures, forests and stock instruments. "
"9729280","9730040"," Give me a second."
"9730240","9732000"," Give me a trial at Ticksright.com."
"9732460","9734000"," I'm going to clean this chart up."
"9735060","9736720"," So what they're trying to tell you is. "
"9738640","9739460"," Put a."
"9741400","9743540"," Do a comparison here and say what I'm talking about."
"9748070","9752330"," There's H.Y.G. We can actually do a T.L.T. as well."
"9752490","9753270"," If you want to hold on here. "
"9756990","9758510"," Form a nice little base in here."
"9758650","9759770"," Just wanted to do a quick update."
"9760710","9764050"," We could take a trip around the market and see if we're going to make a nice little run right"
"9764050","9764510"," here in a minute. "
"9764610","9765850"," But I just want to show you something here."
"9767870","9769090"," Might get a rip right now."
"9770230","9772030"," Might get a nice blast off here. "
"9774740","9776920"," Nice dip buying opportunity right here."
"9778980","9780900"," One, two, three."
"9781340","9785240"," If you look on a book map is light resistance here. "
"9786020","9790120"," This resistance is turning into a yellow I'd say."
"9791360","9792800"," Could have a nice move higher."
"9798880","9803100"," Should price target above 395 13 same places before. "
"9804160","9807980"," I would like to see it trade to 395 50 next."
"9808660","9810460"," And then 398 16."
"9812380","9813160"," We'll look at. "
"9814660","9815500"," Quickly look at."
"9816960","9817740"," Hold on here."
"9821580","9823040"," Just a second here. "
"9825760","9826240"," Indicators."
"9828860","9829600"," Not indicators."
"9830900","9832260"," I need to put this in the same scale. "
"9832520","9835380"," Hold on."
"9839560","9841680"," H.Y.G. is same percentage scale."
"9848040","9848600"," No. "
"9851380","9851940"," Okay."
"9861520","9862800"," Hold on here."
"9863760","9864100"," Yeah. "
"9864400","9864660"," Throw it."
"9864740","9865020"," Fucking."
"9872690","9873250"," Okay. "
"9873530","9873610"," So."
"9874710","9875230"," Here is a chart."
"9875510","9876670"," This is the S&P 500 right. "
"9877890","9880470"," Sometimes you'll see divergences in the market."
"9882310","9882870"," Right."
"9882870","9884350"," Sometimes it all tracks the same. "
"9884530","9885770"," See that's kind of tracking the same here."
"9886310","9887370"," Starts to come back up."
"9887870","9888330"," Starts to track. "
"9889330","9892090"," But every once in a while you'll see a divergence on a smaller time frame."
"9896010","9897710"," I want you to see this right here."
"9899030","9899790"," See right here. "
"9901110","9903010"," See how we're still selling off down here."
"9903710","9906730"," And yet H.Y.G. is going up."
"9907970","9911130"," So you might get like a day of a divergence. "
"9911590","9912690"," You see that divergence right here."
"9918940","9922040"," See how we're still kind of going up here."
"9922200","9927000"," But there's a little bit of falling off on H.Y.G. So it can be a lead. "
"9927360","9928300"," Oh, you guys can't see this shit."
"9936000","9939300"," There's a couple actually 2000."
"9944110","9945690"," 2016, maybe 14. "
"9946370","9947890"," Or is that sideways market."
"9949230","9951490"," I'll bring up TLT for you as well."
"9951490","9954510"," But anyways, it's not really important. "
"9964040","9970330"," I'll bring this time frame up for you a little bit."
"9973570","9974430"," See right here."
"9975610","9976830"," See this bar right here. "
"9976950","9978170"," It's like May 18th."
"9978970","9980690"," So we're selling down right here."
"9980930","9980950"," Right. "
"9982610","9985430"," And a little bit of consolidation down here."
"9985550","9987390"," Yet you're seeing H.Y.G. go up."
"9987830","9989630"," So you'll get like a lead indicator. "
"9990270","9994130"," Or like a leading indicator that's a day in advance."
"9994370","9995270"," Half a day in advance."
"9996470","10000030"," So in a smart time frame, let's call it like a 15 minute chart or something. "
"10008640","10012980"," You would start to see H.Y.G. breaking higher."
"10014420","10019060"," And you would see maybe consolidation here in Spy, right?"
"10019340","10021200"," But you're seeing H.Y.G. take off."
"10021200","10030920"," So an hour later or two, you'll actually see finally the Spy where this is going up and"
"10030920","10032700"," Spy is just consolidating. "
"10033920","10036480"," It's implying that you're going to get a move higher."
"10036640","10037100"," Does that make sense?"
"10038260","10041860"," So that's why you use H.Y.G. as a lead indicator on the market."
"10043020","10045920"," If you started to see we're consolidating here. "
"10047560","10050480"," And here you start seeing H.Y.G. going down."
"10051360","10051760"," Right?"
"10052480","10057100"," You'd be like, oh, I'm going to expect a bloodbath right now in Spy even though it hasn't happened"
"10057100","10057320"," yet."
"10057440","10057900"," Does that make sense?"
"10061200","10069800"," So that's why I use H.Y.G. and J.N.K. in the market. "
"10071100","10074380"," And then when you're looking at Dixie, when I use Dixie here, right?"
"10075480","10077680"," Remember yesterday we were looking at Dixie, right?"
"10077840","10078700"," Every day we look at Dixie."
"10079960","10080520"," We say, well, how much?"
"10080700","10084860"," Let's say H.Y.G. showing you're going to make a move higher, right?"
"10086280","10089700"," How far can we go in that higher move?"
"10090700","10091900"," I think it's not the line right here."
"10092060","10093300"," You know where supply is, right?"
"10093480","10095060"," You know that sellers are sitting here, right?"
"10096380","10097460"," You know you had sellers here. "
"10098900","10102260"," You know you're going to probably have some sellers somewhere in here."
"10103240","10108400"," So if we had a relief rally, you know you're going to be looking for some kind of a confluence"
"10108400","10112960"," up here to take another short position down to resume the down movement in the market."
"10113160","10113560"," Does that make sense?"
"10115440","10119340"," And then you're going to check in on the VIX, right?"
"10119620","10124740"," You're going to then take a look at the VIX and you're going to say, let's bring up the VIX"
"10124740","10124900"," next. "
"10125920","10127120"," Let's Dixie, where's VIX?"
"10132520","10133700"," Just didn't get whatever."
"10134240","10135460"," Let's get a bucket of VIX back up here."
"10135820","10140760"," Ease on the lines as we want to impose new export controls and restrictions, particularly for dual"
"10140760","10147060"," use goods, including key chemicals that agents and electronics and in components that could be used"
"10147060","10148600"," by Russian war machine. "
"10150940","10152920"," You know that buyers are down here, right?"
"10153680","10155160"," Buyers of volatility are down here."
"10155300","10156620"," Buyers of volatility down here."
"10157220","10161040"," You know that buyers of volatility are down here, right?"
"10162760","10164820"," You know there's some sellers up here, right?"
"10164960","10166300"," You see sellers trying to sell it down. "
"10167100","10168460"," Sellers trying to sell it down."
"10168460","10170820"," Sellers are going to come back down and try to sell it down."
"10171440","10172960"," You know we made a trip up right here. "
"10173140","10175620"," So you're more than likely going to see the move here, right?"
"10176340","10176960"," So you're going to wait."
"10177200","10179640"," You see this VIX being sold down already right here, right?"
"10180100","10182560"," How long can we go down into a buyer step back in?"
"10182640","10183340"," It's somewhere down here."
"10184280","10186880"," So it looks like a relief rally is forming, right?"
"10187080","10189840"," And then you'll see this bounce over here. "
"10190640","10193200"," For continuation, this is the continuation down in the market."
"10193760","10195340"," This is the relief bounce right here."
"10196140","10196680"," Does that make sense?"
"10200860","10202180"," So then you're on the spine. "
"10202500","10205800"," You're like, OK, we're going to get a relief bounce."
"10210990","10211390"," Right?"
"10211470","10215190"," Get some nice positive consolidation right here."
"10215650","10217190"," Say, well, how much risk am I going to put on that?"
"10218210","10220470"," Well, fuck and dealers might fuck me today. "
"10222250","10228150"," So they could fuck me right into the bell on Friday to get up to R1."
"10229690","10231810"," People ask you what's the move on Friday?"
"10231810","10233090"," We're going to sell the clothes on Friday."
"10233230","10234550"," Depends on what we do here, right?"
"10235210","10239070"," If we trade up here today to R1, you'd expect the resumption of selling. "
"10240370","10245350"," If we continue to consolidate, we make the move here, right?"
"10245970","10248150"," You'd expect the resumption of selling."
"10249030","10255770"," If we, if they wait until here, say it was a blast off on a Friday here, right?"
"10255890","10256890"," We close right here on Friday."
"10257390","10258450"," What would you expect on Monday?"
"10258990","10260090"," Resumption of selling, right?"
"10260410","10260730"," Does it make sense?"
"10263350","10268550"," If you're like, oh, I picked the right direction cap, but they didn't do it until Monday, right?"
"10269470","10271490"," And these numbers change every day, too, right?"
"10272050","10275030"," To that zero gamma, it's going to change and go up here. "
"10275890","10276850"," No, it's going to go up here."
"10278430","10279250"," That's going to go up here."
"10279670","10280090"," Does it make sense?"
"10280950","10281930"," How long are we consolidating?"
"10282750","10284310"," The higher the potential move is going to be. "
"10285710","10286670"," Does it make sense?"
"10287950","10289250"," And then resumption of selling."
"10290350","10293050"," Unless we can overtake the zero gamma."
"10293250","10294610"," That's when you, this is by the dip. "
"10295270","10296030"," It's a seller rep."
"10309340","10310220"," Not always."
"10310660","10314480"," So Ergo's saying, does, do you always see divergences?"
"10315020","10315380"," Not always. "
"10315880","10322600"," For me personally, how I use, so what I do is, if I'm looking to take a longer, a short"
"10322600","10328400"," position, what I'm trying to do is, I'm trying to look around the market and I'm trying to add up"
"10328400","10330080"," the probabilities, right?"
"10330620","10336850"," So I'm going to be looking at, I'm going to be looking at all of those indicators."
"10337150","10339110"," I'm going to say, where's, what's the path for VIX?"
"10339350","10342690"," What's the path for HIG?"
"10342910","10345470"," What's the path for JNK?"
"10346310","10348010"," What's the path for TLT?"
"10348910","10350930"," Is TLT signaling a sideways market?"
"10351190","10352050"," Is TLT going up?"
"10352690","10353810"," That's a sideways market, right?"
"10354310","10354750"," Inequities."
"10358110","10361350"," Is Dixie, does Dixie have room just to sell off here?"
"10361610","10365290"," Are there sellers nearby to attempt to sell Dixie?"
"10366490","10368310"," Then there's time of day shit on this too. "
"10368890","10372350"," If you're trading futures contracts, like this time's a fucking day, you don't want along the stock"
"10372350","10377230"," market because you know other countries are going to be buying our currencies."
"10378570","10383170"," Then you see traders, you see a Sator on Twitter, follows the yen all the time, right?"
"10383170","10384210"," Euro dollar stuff."
"10387290","10392740"," So yeah, I'm looking for those, I'm looking for that setup. "
"10394700","10396080"," And is there always a divergence?"
"10396540","10396620"," No."
"10397480","10398760"," But sometimes there is."
"10399480","10401480"," There's a, sometimes it'll lead to 15 minutes. "
"10401740","10403600"," Sometimes there's a lead of half a day."
"10404980","10409200"," Sometimes you'll be sitting, I've sat here in days and I've watched our market just sell off into"
"10409200","10414780"," the bell and I'm watching HIG just go up and I'm like, they're fucking pinning this market right"
"10414780","10416180"," now and it's going to explode higher."
"10416800","10421780"," The longer they pin it, the more divergence that's created, the more chance for an explosive move"
"10421780","10422100"," higher. "
"10423340","10424160"," But it's not always."
"10428340","10432120"," But when someone's out there telling you we're going down or someone's telling you we're going up"
"10432120","10434720"," and all those other indicators are telling you something different."
"10435660","10438140"," They're most more than likely wrong and you're more than likely right. "
"10443210","10444550"," Make it thick, only see red."
"10446030","10448050"," So let's ask Mero, Mero's a bear right now."
"10448110","10449830"," So Mero, where do you want to take your next short?"
"10452550","10454970"," Or would it be a preference for you to take a short?"
"10456650","10458750"," It's like today for me, if I was to take a short. "
"10460150","10461790"," I'm going to look for where the bears are hiding."
"10462450","10463270"," They're up here."
"10466010","10466850"," They're right here. "
"10467730","10468570"," They're right here."
"10469170","10469750"," Hold on."
"10470490","10471290"," They're right here. "
"10471830","10473310"," So where are the bears hiding today?"
"10473950","10474630"," They're hiding right here."
"10480140","10481040"," That's where they're hiding."
"10485720","10488080"," That's where a bear wants to get bearish. "
"10488680","10490020"," Right around this R1 area."
"10517390","10517870"," Huge."
"10525970","10527210"," And there they are right there. "
"10527950","10528830"," They're hiding right here."
"10528830","10530050"," They already took it right."
"10530250","10532490"," They already jumped in right here. "
"10532670","10534350"," They were like, fuck you, we're going down."
"10538530","10539410"," Huge sellers."
"10542610","10544070"," You like that, Mero?"
"10544910","10545810"," Mero, you like that?"
"10546670","10547190"," Huge sellers. "
"10547490","10547990"," Sellers hiding."
"10556350","10557470"," You're helping the whack nest."
"10557750","10558370"," They're pulling us down. "
"10559030","10561870"," I was talking about somebody last night about that."
"10561870","10564630"," I was like, I was like, they didn't really whack NASDAQ yet."
"10564810","10565350"," They kind of did. "
"10565630","10567970"," Today it's saying that NASDAQ got whacked yesterday."
"10568990","10577750"," I think they're down to 34% or 40%, but they still need more whacking."
"10578590","10578810"," Not good. "
"10579050","10579410"," 30%."
"10579410","10580110"," It's not good enough."
"10592130","10593230"," Apple's sitting in the cliff. "
"10606360","10615400"," Yeah, the breath indicator is saying, breath indicator is saying,"
"10616020","10625060"," if you want a short sector is the best sector to short right now as utilities."
"10625810","10629320"," In my view, it's the juiciest one."
"10633150","10636510"," It's the juiciest one to short the fuck out of. "
"10640140","10643320"," Let me tell you what the juiciest sectors aren't as short."
"10648520","10650700"," Juiciest one hands down utilities."
"10653240","10654780"," And then consumer staples, I believe. "
"10656880","10658640"," Could be the next juiciest one."
"10660400","10663940"," Tech is that like FinTechs at 43."
"10665600","10666840"," Communications at 50. "
"10667600","10667860"," CND."
"10668040","10669440"," I don't know exactly which one that one is."
"10672120","10681220"," HLT is at 68.8. Utilities of Juiciest is that 86.7. Utilities is like the one you want to"
"10681220","10681320"," be. "
"10682600","10685900"," You want to look to be short in the fuck out of that one."
"10686060","10687480"," It'll be the last one usually to go to."
"10692390","10693030"," I got it. "
"10693150","10693330"," You know what?"
"10693570","10694050"," That's funny."
"10694190","10700050"," Marrow is like someone was saying something about the market being at a bottom."
"10700990","10702310"," And I was like, no, it's not. "
"10702710","10705910"," I was like fucking utilities is still like fucking 90%."
"10705910","10707010"," Everything was at like 10."
"10707290","10708950"," Everything was at like 20%. "
"10711330","10711770"," 30%."
"10711770","10715430"," Everything they'd like sex rotated out of every sector except for utilities."
"10717450","10721510"," And I got like a three day suspension on Twitter because I was like, if I was like, we can't"
"10721510","10723570"," go up until we fucking murder all the bulls and. "
"10724210","10725990"," And, uh, and utilities."
"10726550","10727570"," And so Twitter."
"10728450","10728950"," I'll go bots. "
"10729770","10731210"," We're like, oh, you just threatened to kill somebody."
"10731790","10732950"," No, I didn't."
"10733630","10735990"," I was like, this is fucking bullseyed in fucking utilities. "
"10737110","10743370"," I was like, you got to clean out the fucking the last of the bulls, man."
"10744190","10745290"," Or we're not going up."
"10746470","10749890"," And of course we had like one more blast down in the market. "
"10751430","10754410"," You guys should, uh, you know, you guys want to see a cool comparison?"
"10754870","10759930"," Do a comparison on, uh, an XLU."
"10760270","10767290"," Do like a year long chart on XLU and you, not, I think not always, but fairly often you'll see"
"10767290","10768210"," the last capitulation."
"10768210","10771790"," Move in a downward move in the market is utilities. "
"10773270","10775290"," Like compare utilities to SPX."
"10776670","10780190"," And see at what part of the cycles rotation do that do we sell utilities?"
"10781210","10785850"," It's kind of hilarious, especially in a, in a downtrend market."
"10800260","10804600"," Yeah, then the first one that's the first, uh, it's the last sector to be bought before a rollover. "
"10805080","10806660"," And it's the last sector to be sold."
"10812430","10815430"," Do I believe in the Xmas rally, 2022 or what?"
"10815730","10823410"," Uh, I believe in the Xmas rally, 2022, if we can get down to 38 20."
"10824910","10828610"," By, um, or near there. "
"10829210","10831250"," Not necessarily that exact price, but."
"10831930","10836950"," If we can sell more into, um, CPI and."
"10839450","10841170"," Fucking FOMC and all that nonsense. "
"10842450","10847470"," They can sell good into the, into the, uh, into the 14th, 13th, 14th."
"10853510","10856410"," Everyone seems to think that the day before is going to matter more."
"10856690","10857770"," I think they're going to pin the market. "
"10858490","10859710"," And they're going to trap bulls."
"10860010","10862790"," I think those are going to be like, Oh, we're going up the day before and I think they're going"
"10862790","10864390"," to fucking trap them in."
"10865230","10866690"," Uh, and wait for. "
"10868550","10870890"," Jerome to speak, I think Jerome means more."
"10877080","10878800"," Uh, I don't know if he's going to fuck things up."
"10878960","10882820"," I think if we can, if we can sell down to 38 20, I think that. "
"10883340","10885780"," There's a fair chance of a good Christmas rally."
"10886160","10886600"," I do."
"10887580","10888300"," I think you're going to get up. "
"10889080","10892500"," I think I think if we can sell, if we can sell down into that, into that number."
"10893060","10894240"," By the 14th."
"10894440","10899100"," So if you had like a, um, can't say this is how things are going to go, but. "
"10899100","10904600"," Uh, what I'd like to see."
"10905800","10907840"," You want to give me a, you want to give it."
"10907940","10908100"," You want to give it. "
"10908100","10909940"," You want to, if you're a bull and you want a Christmas rally."
"10913460","10915300"," You want to see something like."
"10920340","10925580"," If you're a bull and you want to like a safe Christmas rally, like you're like, Oh, I feel like"
"10925580","10925700"," that. "
"10925920","10926840"," I feel like I can do this."
"10931700","10933680"," Remember we talked about this yesterday, right?"
"10933860","10935460"," This, uh, could be Friday or Monday."
"10937660","10939020"," You know, the seller's up here. "
"10939060","10941780"," I'd like to see something like, um, something like."
"10944740","10946640"," It doesn't have to be exactly this, but."
"10947720","10949320"," Eventually some kind of a move higher. "
"10950960","10952640"," And then a sell down here."
"10955220","10956620"," I'd like that a lot."
"10957540","10959200"," If it's even this, I don't care. "
"10959760","10961800"," I don't care if it's this and then sideways."
"10962580","10964560"," But something like this, I like."
"10967200","10972620"," And then I would be bullish on CPI or FOMC, whatever. "
"10972880","10973620"," I don't care what it is."
"10973740","10975600"," I'd be bullish on a, on a rip into the end of the year."
"10977500","10978920"," Or maybe an initial rip. "
"10980200","10982360"," Let's just say somehow we get down here."
"10984100","10988280"," I would expect some kind of an initial rip back, back into a trend up."
"10988280","10993620"," And then I grind up, uh, into the 30 or into 23rd. "
"10994360","10995560"," So we can actually."
"11000340","11002600"," Actually, you can actually plot that, right?"
"11004340","11005420"," Uh, let's do it."
"11005580","11006480"," Let's plot that. "
"11007240","11008600"," Some kind of a, uh."
"11021320","11022640"," How do we plot this?"
"11022780","11023940"," We plot this like this, right?"
"11024220","11024740"," We go like this."
"11035650","11037650"," Probably this probably can move like this. "
"11039110","11043430"," And then, uh, something like this, at least into the 24th."
"11045470","11046210"," Right there."
"11058510","11059390"," Something like that. "
"11059510","11059890"," I'd like to see."
"11061490","11062470"," This will rip up."
"11062990","11064410"," You might even get a bloodbath for a minute. "
"11065590","11066390"," Like a, like a."
"11067410","11068230"," Oh, geez."
"11068450","11068930"," Oh, no."
"11069830","11071530"," And then the, the, oh no woman gets bought. "
"11072270","11073110"," Something like this."
"11074950","11076070"," That's what I'd like to see."
"11077150","11078490"," Some kind of path like that. "
"11081910","11084610"," Uh, they could hold bears to it though."
"11084830","11086970"," Like they could do like this move right here."
"11087210","11088030"," Just kind of gnarly. "
"11090230","11095260"," Let me trap all the bears in here for 38, 20."
"11095880","11098580"," So that's why I don't think price really matters as much as market breadth."
"11099960","11102940"," Be a quick plunge down and then, and then a resumption up. "
"11106220","11107760"," They trap the bears in here."
"11109000","11112980"," Quick plunge down on, on volatility and then the rip face higher."
"11113220","11114840"," That's how you get the fuel for the rally too. "
"11115020","11118220"," You need the bears all in over here to get the, get the fuel in the rally."
"11118960","11122160"," I don't know where, I don't know where a positive gamma would be in here."
"11122200","11126140"," We probably rip up until we hit positive gamma and then a slow grind the rest of the way. "
"11126340","11129300"," So there's some, a bunch of technical shit in here we don't know yet."
"11133020","11135940"," We'll know more as a, we'll know more as time goes on."
"11137020","11138500"," Well, it wouldn't be exactly this. "
"11138820","11139640"," We could figure it out."
"11139860","11141520"," I'm too lazy to figure it out to be honest with you."
"11141780","11143240"," Right now I'm too lazy to figure it out. "
"11143560","11144360"," I don't really care."
"11146260","11149440"," Uh, this actually could, this actually could take place in the Monday too."
"11150720","11152760"," This could be over there. "
"11157240","11158500"," Okay, we could clean this up."
"11166170","11169230"," Like if you had a high and low range, this is the high range, the low range."
"11171570","11173730"," This actually changes over time too. "
"11176540","11178180"," Something like the, or the potential."
"11178960","11181000"," I guess you could do a second one."
"11184240","11186060"," You like a low range down here. "
"11188780","11190560"," Uh, seller is right there."
"11191000","11192020"," Something like this."
"11201470","11203590"," That might be that 420 level up there. "
"11206650","11209710"," Something like this path."
"11219020","11221740"," Could be there, could be there, could be there."
"11223620","11224840"," Time passes, right?"
"11225240","11226140"," Like these numbers go up. "
"11229080","11232160"," Yeah, all these numbers go up and then we sell, right?"
"11232300","11233840"," Eventually we sell, sell, sell down here."
"11234500","11236420"," Anyways, something like this."
"11241900","11243440"," It actually brings us down, I think. "
"11248380","11250140"," Trade it up and then down like this."
"11251140","11251920"," Something like that."
"11252020","11253160"," I don't know exactly what it is right now. "
"11263740","11264600"," That's what I'm going to expect."
"11279140","11280060"," Alright, I'm going to take a break."
"11280320","11281760"," I'm going to leave you guys here to it. "
"11283940","11289640"," I guess that say has been so fucking boring."
"11289880","11290240"," Yep, consolidation."
"11293640","11294620"," Yeah, you're building it in. "
"11294800","11297380"," Yeah, there's a, you could probably make the range wider too."
"11298320","11307130"," You'll see it firm up and, uh, holy shit, at least six people showed up."
"11307710","11316060"," I was watching this lady at Walmart walk through the clothing section. "
"11316060","11317600"," We'll have your kids show her face and candy."
"11317880","11318240"," Oh man."
"11323980","11325280"," That's three to play today. "
"11325480","11329760"," No, I think three to two is, I think a target of, I think if you're a bear, you want"
"11329760","11332580"," to have a healthy target of looking at three to two."
"11332700","11334160"," Doesn't matter if we actually get there or not."
"11335420","11337140"," That's a matter of where you want to be positioned. "
"11337140","11341580"," Uh, the safest bet for a bear."
"11342980","11344700"," Is to sell on a high, right?"
"11345080","11345380"," Remember that."
"11345560","11348400"," If you're, if you're a bear, you want to, you want to sell on a high. "
"11348540","11351260"," If you're a bull, you want to buy in a low, right?"
"11361220","11361620"," Yeah."
"11361800","11365760"," If you have a, so like, so if you're a bear, you want to sell on a high."
"11366440","11368700"," You want to have a price target of 38 20. "
"11369180","11372300"," You want to know that you are likely not to get there."
"11372300","11377340"," Unless some volatility is added to the market or more, more bears are convinced."
"11378400","11380800"," To buy lower, uh, puts. "
"11381440","11385240"," You'll find sometimes that bears will bulls do the same thing."
"11385240","11387080"," As you approach 38 20."
"11387580","11392300"," They won't be buying puts for 37 20 3600. "
"11393180","11398560"," If you can convince bears to buy puts at 3600 or lower."
"11398900","11401480"," We could trade to 30 to 38 20."
"11401480","11405380"," If bears start buying, just puts only for 38 20. "
"11405880","11407440"," We won't actually trade to it."
"11407520","11409100"," We'll trade it with trade like 3900."
"11410340","11414640"," You need to, you need bears to, like you, they bull say they need to buy lower than where you're"
"11414640","11415400"," actually trading to. "
"11416780","11419300"," And continue it like more outside the money puts."
"11420000","11423680"," Once put start to become more inside the money, the market will actually flatten out."
"11426680","11427940"," Does it make sense?"
"11427940","11429980"," We won't trade to 38 20 if everyone's buying. "
"11431480","11435360"," Like if everyone's buying 390 P's, we're not going to trade to 30 20."
"11438720","11439160"," Yeah."
"11446720","11451500"," So this is, this is kind of like above here is positive gamma down here is negative gamma. "
"11459260","11460540"," I don't trust JP."
"11460880","11461440"," It is Mary Bennett."
"11461600","11466100"," I think they want to exert more control until next year, but I would love to be wrong. "
"11472140","11472580"," Yeah."
"11472840","11473060"," Like."
"11474740","11475840"," I think a bull. "
"11476540","11481340"," And I'm like, so people are like, what do you mean by hawkish is like, I'm like hawkish is bullish"
"11481340","11481700"," and."
"11482620","11485420"," People are like, what do you mean by hawkish is bullish and."
"11487420","11489020"," Dovish is bearish. "
"11489900","11491480"," I'm like, well, like if they."
"11492820","11496860"," If they surprise with a davish statement, you're more than likely going to see a market reaction"
"11496860","11497440"," move up."
"11497440","11498160"," A big one. "
"11498520","11502800"," But then it would look, we would probably have a crash afterwards, like two weeks later."
"11503900","11509400"," Then I'm like, if you have a, if you have, if you got slammed with a 35 or a 75"
"11509400","11515080"," point rate rate increase, you'd probably see the market initially sell the fucking world."
"11515080","11521480"," We'd blast, we'd blast lower initially, but you'd probably be able to buy a tradable dip down there"
"11521480","11521720"," too. "
"11522380","11523320"," It's kind of weird."
"11523320","11524400"," It's kind of weird."
"11524660","11527540"," Like, which time frame are you talking about kind of stuff and. "
"11530960","11535020"," Someone on Twitter a few days ago said that I think we were up around."
"11535840","11537820"," We were up around four 10 or something."
"11538740","11544020"," I think like last Wednesday or Thursday or something, we were talking here in stream about, man, I"
"11544020","11546380"," don't want to buy for a long here at four 10. "
"11546500","11548340"," I'd really like to see the mark from down a little bit."
"11548340","11552240"," And then we started trading down, I think Friday, Thursday, Friday."
"11554640","11557600"," And we're looking forward to hopefully trading down, not this deep. "
"11559060","11561600"," Not this much of a, of a sell off."
"11561900","11565860"," We weren't anticipating it to be this deep, which is outstanding for bears."
"11566620","11567100"," Congratulations to bears. "
"11567400","11571260"," But we wanted to stay in positive gamma, right?"
"11571600","11572060"," Trade up higher."
"11573000","11576580"," And we didn't stay in positive gamma, so trade down below positive gamma bears open the door to"
"11576580","11577000"," lower lows."
"11580440","11583860"," But I guess my point here is that. "
"11586740","11589980"," There's no real pathway up unless you get some selling, right?"
"11590260","11591820"," There's no pathway to four 30."
"11592020","11594340"," There's no, when we're at four 10, there was no direct path."
"11595620","11599380"," Maybe close the gap at four 20 and then immediately sell back down. "
"11599800","11603000"," Was a possible extension, but that didn't happen."
"11603000","11603960"," We sold right off, right?"
"11604140","11605480"," They paid right off four 10."
"11606140","11610380"," You heard Mike Williams or Wilson come out and say, there's not enough room to. "
"11610560","11612660"," He was like, he said that yesterday on Monday."
"11613260","11616520"," That was one of my, that's one of my, that's if you have a bullish case there."
"11617020","11621340"," One of the quotes from him on Monday was, there's not enough room. "
"11621840","11626320"," There's enough juice to go up there, which is a fair point."
"11626620","11631340"," If we're down here at 390 or 380, there's now more juice to go up to."
"11632300","11634360"," Four 20, four 30, four 40. "
"11634540","11639760"," If you want to go to those numbers and there's like in a bank and see a 500 point move"
"11639760","11642100"," up, they might take that just for the money."
"11643500","11644260"," See what I'm saying?"
"11644480","11649540"," So we're at 380 and they're like, eh, if we're at 380, right?"
"11650600","11653620"," And big banks like, well, how deep can we go?"
"11653940","11654660"," 200 points."
"11654960","11655540"," Maybe we'll get 3600. "
"11656180","11658120"," Maybe we'll get, we're going to probably get a reaction at least."
"11658500","11662960"," If you're like a big bank, you're like, eh, at 3800, what are we going to get out of this?"
"11663840","11665100"," We're going to get a strong reaction."
"11665360","11668680"," We know we're going to get a strong reaction off 3600, 3500. "
"11668860","11672380"," You know that the fucking buyer, the Algos are going to sit, the computers are going to sit there"
"11672380","11672940"," and just buy it."
"11674960","11680820"," So if we're down at 3800, a guy like Mike Wilson might say, well, you know, we can always go"
"11680820","11685900"," up, you know, three to 500 points real quick, tag all that shit and we can sell our big positions"
"11685900","11688020"," and these big companies into fucking strength."
"11688620","11689980"," You guys get all that stuff?"
"11691160","11692480"," You guys understand that stuff?"
"11699270","11701570"," So you might get some leverage from a bank. "
"11701730","11707050"," You might get a guy like Mike Wilson or any of those guys that might help you out as a"
"11707050","11710490"," bull into a FMC."
"11711690","11715570"," So if you're a bull, you're probably like, yeah, let's get some 3820 going."
"11715570","11719510"," So I can get fucking a big bank on my side to make a face ripper. "
"11722710","11724010"," Beers don't want to hear that do that."
"11724110","11725410"," They want to hear straight to the pits of hell."
"11725910","11727090"," Bulls don't want to hear that either. "
"11727230","11728550"," They're like, just start going up now, Cap."
"11729450","11730870"," That's just not how the market works."
"11731230","11739890"," So we go up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down. "
"11746380","11750720"," Yeah, Leonard's saying a spy 420 by Christmas, 100% Santa and good news rally coming."
"11751060","11751920"," Yeah, I can see that."
"11751920","11753920"," I would love that. "
"11754200","11755140"," I'm down with that trade."
"11756480","11757080"," I'm done."
"11757240","11758240"," I'm totally down with that trade. "
"11761010","11761870"," I'm totally down."
"11762030","11765250"," I'm definitely down with trade to 420 or 430 or 440."
"11767030","11769470"," The Algos are saying that that's going to happen. "
"11769850","11774150"," I showed an algo yesterday that the algo doesn't believe that we're going down."
"11774350","11775590"," The algo is like, fuck you."
"11776230","11778370"," Sorry for swearing, but the algo is like, we're going up. "
"11778370","11783610"," And the farther that we stretch down, the bigger up we're going."
"11785210","11790930"," The algo is like, the algo is tough and the algo is pretty right."
"11791250","11792150"," It's usually right. "
"11792710","11793270"," So we'll see."
"11793570","11794770"," We'll see if it's right still."
"11796930","11798250"," I'll go say and we're going up. "
"11798590","11800150"," I'll go say, and Mike Wilson's a liar."
"11813950","11817210"," Yeah, no, that we were definitely looking for an extension to four."
"11817370","11819230"," There was definitely room for an extension. "
"11819230","11820990"," There was an extension to 420 up there."
"11824580","11825320"," We could have easily."
"11825320","11826780"," I thought we could have easily extended. "
"11827120","11828700"," I measured that we could extend to 420."
"11829620","11831600"," If we did, though, it'd be an immediate sell off."
"11832000","11832800"," It wouldn't hold. "
"11833200","11834680"," We knew that if it did go up there."
"11834680","11837420"," If it went to 415 or 420, it wouldn't hold."
"11839860","11841220"," There was no way for it to hold. "
"11847040","11847820"," Good algo."
"11850560","11857780"," I want you to make like a Twitter account just to talk to me quietly in the background."
"11859060","11860880"," Just don't tell anybody you have a Twitter handle. "
"11863650","11867770"," Well, like follow something like cat pictures or something winky so that you're not being"
"11867770","11868650"," influenced by Twitter."
"11871490","11883690"," Then send me DMs. Yeah, we"
"11883690","11884730"," got to give the algo a name. "
"11887730","11889210"," We have to give the algo a name."
"11894260","11896620"," Yeah, Tony, she's saying my whole insta feed is cats."
"11896880","11897840"," That's working out very well. "
"11902050","11903710"," I feel the same way about Twitter."
"11906390","11907690"," I feel the same way about it."
"11907690","11909490"," You know what I started doing on Twitter recently?"
"11909910","11912470"," I started fucking muting all that shit that you're talking about. "
"11913070","11914370"," I was like mute, mute, mute, mute."
"11916510","11921010"," The Republican Hill says the GOP will pursue policies to enhance bank capital."
"11921410","11922370"," Oh, dude, algo marino. "
"11922770","11923170"," I like that."
"11924010","11924890"," I like algo marino."
"11925210","11926450"," You guys have any ideas for algo names?"
"11927470","11928630"," I like algo marino. "
"11928630","11929770"," Great that damn."

"12047380","12050940"," That was a, oh yeah, I'll go make algo face."
"12051120","12051800"," I like that one. "
"12052180","12057740"," I like that one a lot too."
"12057860","12058440"," I'll go long."
"12060120","12061520"," I like that one too. "
"12062000","12062900"," You guys have some great names."
"12066300","12067180"," VP algorithm."
"12073280","12076620"," You guys are fucking some great fucking great ideas for algo names. "
"12087580","12089100"," Nice little trade higher here."
"12089480","12091780"," We'll take a look at just the book map real quick."
"12096550","12099890"," Got a buyer starting to match sellers right now, which is good. "
"12101370","12103470"," See accumulation in the market right now."
"12103490","12104010"," It's really good."
"12105070","12105470"," Very productive. "
"12127500","12130440"," Remember that we're in a seller rip still."
"12130440","12134440"," So even if we go higher, it's only for supply."
"12134440","12142480"," I wonder if we get sick, man. "
"12142620","12150220"," I thought I'd hurt my voice, but I like my, as my vocal cords, but I'm getting like popping errors"
"12150220","12151000"," and stuff now."
"12166800","12168280"," Rips are to be sold into."
"12168540","12168840"," Remember that. "
"12169600","12175000"," So every taking longs, you have to be measuring, you know, how productive they're going to be."
"12176480","12179200"," You're going to be looking for key areas for reversals."
"12179820","12182120"," If you're taking longs, I would have tight stops. "
"12183260","12185360"," So that you're not giving money back on Rips higher."
"12186720","12193680"," So make sure you have, make sure you have areas of putting your stops in so you're not being, you"
"12193680","12199060"," don't want to see stuff like this move higher and then an immediate reversal."
"12201840","12204420"," You don't want to see move higher, immediate reversal. "
"12207000","12211100"," You don't want to see us go up here and then get blasted straight down to the depths of hell."
"12213860","12215340"," That's not, you can't take these trades."
"12215700","12219580"," It's that you have to, you have to bring your stops up right along with them so that you don't"
"12219580","12220540"," get trapped in a reversal. "
"12221420","12222800"," Just right here is a perfect example."
"12225360","12225760"," Right?"
"12229320","12232340"," Prime example of getting trapped without having stops in place."
"12234440","12239480"," So if you're taking longs here, just, just move them up, move them up, move them up until there's a"
"12239480","12239800"," rejection. "
"12250430","12253350"," You, if I lose my sense of smell, pray that it comes back."
"12253530","12255250"," I got COVID mid-October minus still gone."
"12255510","12255770"," No shit. "
"12256470","12257830"," I haven't lost my sense of smell yet."
"12259170","12262370"," Everything I've had coffee this morning, some tea."
"12263530","12269790"," I haven't eaten any food yet this morning, but my dinner last night, my dinner last night was"
"12269790","12270630"," fucking outstanding. "
"12272370","12282190"," I had a veil meatballs with homemade spaghetti or whatever, like handmade, handmade spaghetti in"
"12282190","12284190"," this like red sauce."
"12284190","12286030"," I was so good."
"12287470","12288950"," I haven't had a veil in a long time. "
"12289470","12290770"," I was pretty, pretty happy with the veil."
"12298070","12301410"," The clear news is great because they did it last week."
"12301950","12303190"," Yeah, I don't know if I'm sick. "
"12303430","12309170"," I was feeling fine, but I was talking so much yesterday that my vocal cords hurt today."
"12309730","12310410"," And I'm a sore throat."
"12311550","12316390"," I don't have, my ears are a little boxed out right now. "
"12317310","12318410"," I'm fully vaxxed."
"12326830","12331570"," But I did do some travel on this weekend, so, you know, it's not like I haven't been, like, my"
"12331570","12335950"," contact with people was high this past weekend."
"12345030","12346030"," Yeah, I'll do it today. "
"12348010","12351010"," Rinsing with Listerine and X clear nasal spray."
"12355920","12356960"," I'm going to write that down."
"12357300","12357620"," It's clear. "
"12361420","12362420"," I've got Listerine."
"12364620","12367280"," I think what I need to do is stop talking for a day."
"12368740","12370420"," Just take the rest of the day off or something. "
"12370600","12371400"," That's what I think I need to do."
"12375680","12377360"," You're personally feeling traveling public."
"12377600","12380900"," Yes, they got a mask up when I'm out in public places. "
"12381120","12384520"," You know what I was afraid of was I was walking up and down."
"12386320","12392040"," So there's these high traffic areas at ski resorts and everyone's got their hands on the handrails"
"12392040","12392960"," because they got boots on."
"12394120","12397120"," And then you get, like, all these kids with no gloves on. "
"12397380","12399960"," They're just, like, dragging their hands across the handrails."
"12399960","12404360"," I've got my gloves on, but I'm like, man, I'm fucking just picking up every other asshole's shit"
"12404360","12404780"," right now."
"12407310","12415470"," So whether you do believe or not believe in COVID or whatever, they still try to practice some"
"12415470","12425330"," kind of like, you know, like, when there's too many people around, I don't know. "
"12425470","12432810"," I've been less sick too overall in like public spaces, people that don't know that kind of shit."
"12434710","12438750"," I haven't been, and the truth is, I haven't been sick in like a, I've been sick in three or"
"12438750","12439350"," four years now."
"12440550","12441190"," Not once. "
"12442130","12444050"," Not one time in like three or four years."
"12447860","12449160"," Probably got the monkey runna."
"12449660","12452820"," The, uh, it is ex, it is ex player. "
"12459680","12460940"," Yeah, it's really weird."
"12461100","12464000"," People get pissed at me too with wearing a mask and I'm like, you know what?"
"12464240","12466700"," I'm like, I don't want you fucking coughing on me."
"12466960","12472900"," So I used to live in Asia and everyone there wears masks. "
"12474080","12475420"," And I didn't know why they did."
"12476760","12483100"," And, uh, then it was explained to me that when people get sick there, they wear a mask so they"
"12483100","12483820"," don't get you sick."
"12485040","12487160"," Um, or at the time that's what it was. "
"12489440","12493700"," So like a little bit of courtesy goes a long way, especially if you're sick, like you're sick, you"
"12493700","12494760"," should be wearing a fucking mask."
"12495280","12503290"," I know that's not cool thing to be doing, but, um, even if you don't believe in that, I don't"
"12503290","12506130"," care, like if you don't believe in COVID or if you don't think it's that bad, I don't care."
"12506470","12508430"," I'm just like a common courtesy kind of thing. "
"12509370","12512690"," Um, and if you see me wearing a mask, what the fuck do you care?"
"12513430","12515930"," I'm not, I don't care if you wear a mask or not, to be honest with you."
"12517150","12519910"," But if I'm wearing one, just leave me alone."
"12523930","12525090"," Well, that's what I have done. "
"12525390","12532010"," So I've, I've had a couple brief interactions where I've been asked why I'm wearing a mask."
"12532010","12533010"," And I just told them point blank."
"12533210","12537210"," I've got COVID and I didn't, of course, but I have said that. "
"12544430","12548150"," Yeah, this is pretty much the same topic that Winky's talking about, right?"
"12548590","12554570"," When you get on to like Twitter, man, in like these fucking websites or even Reddit, it's like"
"12554570","12558290"," they're creating this fucking like fight over stupid shit."
"12558790","12562690"," I was looking at, uh, you know, I was looking at the other day, I was looking at something that"
"12562690","12568490"," showed like, um, there's something about fucking, you know, it's like, on one side, it's like, get"
"12568490","12569210"," these fucking Nazis."
"12569470","12578050"," And on the other side, you got like a very small fringe group of, um, uh, LGBT TQ and they're"
"12578050","12585070"," putting, like, they're putting these really fringe elements of groups of people that most people"
"12585070","12586650"," don't even know these people. "
"12587090","12594230"," Like you might know someone that's, um, uh, LGBTQ, but they're not, they're just normal people."
"12594770","12595290"," Does that make sense?"
"12595830","12602170"," You might have like a grandfather that's kind of slightly fucking racist, you know, and you, you"
"12602170","12605030"," know, you tolerate this, right?"
"12605290","12609370"," But you're not, it's not like you're sitting in your living room when you've got like a fucking"
"12609370","12616050"," Nazi sitting in the corner and you got a fucking, you know, a militant, uh, pissed off, uh, you"
"12616050","12621390"," know, someone dressed in like as an, as an ultra drag queen in your, in your other living room"
"12621390","12621630"," chair."
"12621630","12623750"," And you guys are fighting, duking it out. "
"12624450","12629470"," But yet we go on to social media and we're like screaming and yelling."
"12630450","12631330"," It's bizarre."
"12632130","12632970"," It's so bizarre. "
"12636150","12636950"," You know what I mean?"
"12637150","12639950"," There's like, it doesn't matter which side of this you're on."
"12640310","12645290"," If you're lean right or lean left or whatever, but it's so bizarre because it's like triggering,"
"12645510","12646550"," it's triggering for you."
"12646590","12647930"," It's triggering for other people. "
"12649990","12652150"," Just try to live a good life, be a good person."
"12652550","12653590"," Keep people with respect."
"12654830","12655670"," You're not in your life. "
"12656690","12657730"," None of these people are."
"12658490","12659470"," Wherever life you're living."
"12660990","12666530"," I hope that, I hope that you don't have that kind of, uh, constant. "
"12666930","12667950"," I hope that you don't have that in your life."
"12668150","12669990"," You live, whatever life you choose to live."
"12670190","12671450"," You're able to live it how you want to. "
"12672430","12674350"," Wherever is the norm for you, you're able to live it."
"12674350","12678950"," And, uh, but like the, like the Twitter saga, like the, the easy thing."
"12679690","12684250"," And then like all this other nonsense and then even, like, Elon, I'm upset with him right now. "
"12684330","12686730"," It's like, it's just creating shit."
"12687710","12689090"," And we're like the plebs."
"12689310","12692230"," We're like the little guys in the, we're like the nobodies. "
"12692730","12694030"," And we think we're somebody."
"12694750","12696230"," Let me get all fired up on it."
"12696930","12698190"," It pisses us off. "
"12698710","12700170"," It makes us triggered out in public."
"12700610","12701270"," So fucked up."
"12702070","12704530"," And, uh, we all think we're somebody and we're nobody. "
"12704530","12706650"," We're like tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny specs."
"12716300","12719860"," You know, just try to be, try to live a good life."
"12720820","12721660"," It's so hard. "
"12721820","12722340"," I don't know why."
"12722760","12723460"," I can, winky."
"12723680","12723880"," I understand. "
"12724580","12725580"," I feel the same way, man."
"12731180","12732220"," Yeah, it's pretty simple."
"12733800","12734940"," It's pretty simple. "
"12735700","12737280"," Yeah, like, like it's so bizarre."
"12737500","12737760"," I don't know."
"12737860","12738240"," It's so bizarre. "
"12743830","12746870"," We've got some, we were being productive here right now in the market."
"12747430","12751350"," Um, we've got good consolidation in here."
"12751610","12754870"," You know, even when I say this stuff, don't even worry, sell the rip. "
"12755550","12757730"," Uh, this is, that's, that's positive."
"12758650","12761130"," We're breaking below here."
"12762270","12764250"," But this is positive right here. "
"12765110","12767250"," Might make another, another attack higher."
"12770260","12773440"," Uh, if there is any kind of failure down here, I might buy some calls."
"12773440","12775040"," If we can get down here, I'll buy some calls. "
"12787970","12789610"," I know there's some bad people out there."
"12789770","12795930"," I know there's, I know there's bad people, um, out there on both sides of thing."
"12796170","12797610"," All, I know there's bad people are placed. "
"12797810","12800770"," But for you, me, how I live, I try to keep good people around me."
"12802050","12803570"," Try to keep happy people around me."
"12804510","12805550"," I got a wife, two daughters. "
"12805950","12809350"," I don't want my daughters to be, uh, you know, bad people when they grow up."
"12810030","12812310"," I don't want to be that father to them either, right?"
"12812530","12821570"," Is, um, I couldn't imagine my, my children having like the mean, nasty father or teach my kids to"
"12821570","12822530"," be mean, nasty people."
"12823530","12829550"," How unhealthy that is, you know, if you're meant, you're like mental well being, your spirituality,"
"12829610","12830390"," all that kind of stuff. "
"12833160","12839980"," You ever notice, um, I was just talking to, uh, the daughter about this."
"12839980","12846760"," And I was telling her about when I was young and, um, like you, when you're young, you're like, oh,"
"12846820","12847940"," I want to date crazy over there."
"12849400","12854120"," And so you date enough crazy until you find someone that you meet. "
"12854380","12855840"," It doesn't matter if it's a boy or girl or whatever."
"12856640","12857940"," Day, then whatever, not a care."
"12858540","12861940"," Uh, but you ever notice like you meet, especially when you're growing up, when you're like a"
"12861940","12864340"," teenager, young adult into your thirties. "
"12865220","12868600"," Um, you ever notice you're around certain people you're happy all the time?"
"12868600","12871120"," Your friends just couldn't, doesn't even have to be a love interest."
"12871360","12871960"," Could just be a friend."
"12872560","12873540"," Even just your friends out there. "
"12873940","12876440"," You know, it's like some, some people and they're just always happy."
"12877080","12879820"," Like getting a little bit of that in your life is a real nice thing."
"12880240","12881560"," It really does make life better. "
"12888530","12890070"," You always, I was the self."
"12890370","12894430"," Yeah, that's just a, uh, I try to play a role."
"12894850","12897110"," I try to like, give you guys some, some color. "
"12899870","12901410"," But I'm not really that guy in real life."
"12906690","12910430"," It's just, it's just an image to, it's just an image for you guys that."
"12911290","12912710"," Something fucking laugh about her. "
"12913410","12914410"," Make fun of me."
"12916110","12919430"," Uh, but I was in the military and I do sale."
"12919870","12924030"," So, uh, those all, those all match up to all match up to who I am. "
"12924850","12925650"," I am a sailor."
"12930080","12930760"," It does."
"12931360","12932000"," It does. "
"12932000","12938800"," You know, it's funny too is, um, we, we talk about our, like our parents, our grandparents, our"
"12938800","12939300"," great grandparents."
"12941440","12944560"," Like how my dad was raised versus how I was raised."
"12944900","12951400"," Now how I'm raising my children and you see like the generational differences in how, in how you're"
"12951400","12952020"," raising your kids. "
"12955540","12958060"," I always wonder if we'll cycle back through into that."
"12958800","12963180"," Like do you go through cycles where you have dysfunction, you have less dysfunction, you have less"
"12963180","12963500"," dysfunction."
"12963880","12967700"," And then all of a sudden you have one generation of just real dysfunction. "
"12968440","12970060"," Does that cycle restart?"
"12970420","12970960"," We don't know yet."
"12971100","12971780"," We're, we're wondering."
"12982980","12984320"," You're working on the reversal now. "
"12984500","12985200"," Yeah, I've been that."
"12985500","12987220"," I've, I shouldn't say I haven't been an asshole."
"12987380","12991600"," My job, uh, my profession, I was an asshole. "
"12992400","12993260"," I'll be honest with you."
"12995100","12997100"," I had very high expectations."
"12998400","13005000"," I had very high demands of people and I was not well liked in my, my actual job itself. "
"13005880","13007180"," I was like worse than the human race."
"13007180","13008200"," You didn't want to see me."
"13008400","13012720"," If you saw me, if I was hired to come in to help your company, heads were rolling. "
"13013280","13016620"," So you were automatically were just, I was automatically disliked."
"13019420","13020780"," Um, well, not automatically."
"13021440","13023760"," I was usually liked by the people I was firing. "
"13024000","13025800"," I should be honest more, not more honest, but."
"13027540","13032600"," The mostly the people that liked me were going to, going to get their heads, uh, chopped off."
"13032940","13039780"," And the ones that typically didn't like me were usually the best, um, workforce that they had. "
"13051300","13052000"," Yeah, it's weird."
"13052180","13054720"," Like the business that I was in, it was a sign of weakness."
"13055060","13057040"," Like this would be no businesses like that, right?"
"13057660","13062680"," Um, you have to not so much be, you can be a nice guy, but you don't want to be"
"13062680","13063840"," known as like a nice guy that. "
"13063840","13066640"," Can, can, you know, end your employment or whatever."
"13067720","13071640"," They smile and as a firearm, I mean, I'm being figured to hear."
"13073160","13076080"," But, uh, I was kind of a fucking asshole. "
"13076980","13078020"," And I would take that shit."
"13078360","13078700"," I would, I would."
"13079100","13083220"," Or that, that, uh, that impacted my personal life too. "
"13084040","13086640"," I'm so grateful that I don't have to do that stuff anymore."
"13098220","13099700"," You know, you have to have an asshole song."
"13100800","13101600"," I was part of my job. "
"13101600","13103380"," Well, you know, it wasn't part of my job."
"13103540","13113480"," It was that, uh, my job where it wasn't being an asshole, but it was, um, a serious"
"13113480","13123200"," job that required serious attention and, uh, usually people were business owners were in that"
"13123200","13124760"," position where they needed that."
"13124760","13132720"," Um, like, like, um, do or die, right?"
"13132920","13134100"," Your business is going to go bankrupt. "
"13134320","13135060"," You don't have a choice here."
"13137000","13144560"," We keep things, you know, the publicly keep things, uh, a public persona of being nice, but, uh,"
"13146260","13149860"," there were some very ruthless things people had to do to become profitable."
"13163650","13165590"," Man, what's talking about a sideways market, huh?"
"13165990","13166390"," Consolidation. "
"13168150","13169770"," Not a whole lot going on here."
"13171770","13172570"," Just consolidation."
"13173410","13175250"," We're talking about this yesterday into the battle. "
"13176170","13179890"," Some, we're talking about what to expect this upcoming next for the rest of the week."
"13179890","13184030"," And I was like, man, I was like, they could fucking, they could pin this"
"13184030","13190530"," shit."
"13190530","13194330"," They could pin this fucking market for days if they wanted to. "
"13194930","13195750"," They really could."
"13201980","13204580"," Good thing we took the, took the print up here, huh?"
"13204820","13207580"," Did you guys all take the print with me up here on the opening bell, the calls?"
"13207920","13210680"," Did you guys get, did you guys, uh, monetize these calls up here?"
"13211780","13212400"," This morning."
"13220640","13222560"," I'm so glad I took profit in here, man. "
"13222740","13225320"," I'm like, oh, this nonsense in here."
"13227320","13228900"," Probably waiting for the Robinhooders."
"13230240","13231860"," Who can't trade after what is it?"
"13232000","13232900"," Two 30 or three 30. "
"13232960","13233900"," Then they'll make the move higher."
"13235900","13237860"," Like Robinhooders with like their zero day calls."
"13238120","13239600"," Can you imagine me in a Robinhooder right now?"
"13239940","13241280"," I can't even, I can't even. "
"13241820","13243460"," So like, so they're like."
"13245600","13246520"," See the OE."
"13247040","13249480"," See the OE is like, okay, we're going to introduce zero dates now. "
"13249480","13250520"," And you can't trade them."
"13252900","13257380"," We now have OPEC's five days a week and fuck you, Robinhooders."
"13263370","13267810"," Do you imagine being a Robinhooder and being like, I can't even trade this stuff. "
"13268890","13273190"," So Biden risks 2023 debt stand off as GOP digs in."
"13273550","13276590"," And according to and Democrats white."
"13276590","13283410"," So again, Biden risks 2023 debt stand off as GOP digs in and Democrats wait. "
"13284050","13284970"," What you saying there?"
"13285110","13285350"," Garrett."
"13286590","13288330"," Oh, you're, are you Robinhooder?"
"13289450","13290550"," Yeah, that would suck."
"13290810","13291550"," You got to get out of there. "
"13291710","13293830"," There's if you any of you guys are on Robinhood."
"13295350","13301730"," At least, I guess if there was a graduated step, I'm testing out this dream is sponsored by to the"
"13301730","13301970"," tick."
"13306790","13312850"," I do have some news for you guys, but I don't want to break the news to you yet. "
"13313030","13313390"," Just yet."
"13315750","13320250"," But I have been reached out to and I've reached out to."
"13322450","13325990"," Companies that I've used and companies are interested in using. "
"13326950","13332230"," If they, if they, if they're, if their services suck, I'm never going to talk to you."
"13332290","13334090"," But I'm saying maybe it's better that I don't say anything."
"13337030","13344310"," Specifically, but I am trying to find if I've been, people have been reaching out to me. "
"13345910","13346310"," So."
"13348270","13352730"," If that happens, we'll try to, we'll try to find something to get you out of Robinhood trade"
"13352730","13353350"," somewhere else."
"13354630","13355450"," We'll do something. "
"13361080","13365740"," I don't think that you can on Robinhood unless they change that real recently."
"13366500","13369280"," I don't think that you can trade zero date options."
"13371000","13375200"," I think I don't know if you can, I think you can buy them in the morning, but you can't"
"13375200","13377640"," or you have to sell out of them by 230 or 330. "
"13378400","13384480"," Correct me if I'm wrong on that, but I think I've been told by people that you can't."
"13384960","13387640"," You can close them, you can't open them."
"13388060","13389360"," So the problem with zero dates. "
"13390560","13392000"," So let me explain this better."
"13393060","13394580"," I think I know, I think I got this right."
"13395060","13396060"," I'm not positive on this. "
"13396500","13399040"," So, so you could correct me if I'm wrong on this, but."
"13400100","13404380"," So when I think the Robinhood, let's say it's 230 in the afternoon."
"13406020","13407000"," It could be 330. "
"13408500","13410860"," But let's say right here, this is 230 in the afternoon, right?"
"13411480","13414400"," So let's say you bought some zero dates."
"13416100","13417700"," Zero date calls, let's just say you did."
"13417940","13419140"," That's zero dates right here, right?"
"13421900","13425320"," So your position, we start to do this kind of a thing. "
"13426420","13427660"," And now we're down here."
"13428720","13430280"," I think at the rip higher to the bell, right?"
"13432240","13438040"," You're in a zero date position here and wanted to add to your position because you're upside down"
"13438040","13438460"," in it now."
"13438460","13444480"," I don't think that you could add to your position and I don't think you could open a new position"
"13444480","13446460"," here on zero dates specifically. "
"13447260","13451660"," And I don't think you can even trade a map between four and four fifteen."
"13451800","13452700"," I could be wrong on this."
"13454300","13461720"," So like a most, a most trading platforms, you can trade until open and close until four fifteen. "
"13462140","13464840"," Let me know if I'm wrong on that, but I think that I'm right on that one."
"13464840","13470800"," So there's some like mechanical issues with trading the stock market in here that's kind of like a"
"13470800","13473220"," super sketchy."
"13473580","13476240"," There's another, there's an impact on that too. "
"13476340","13485360"," If you can't do anything but close in here in the positions going against you, it could trigger"
"13485360","13488820"," like some kind of like be be fearful, right?"
"13489100","13491140"," You'll never recover your position unless you add to it."
"13491960","13493600"," There's like, I think that's right."
"13494320","13497340"," I could be wrong on that, but you let me know if I'm wrong on that. "
"13504110","13505030"," Okay, so yeah."
"13507110","13508370"," I think that's right."
"13510550","13510950"," Yeah. "
"13511630","13516010"," And I don't think you can trade a map, but can you guys open and close by contracts at four"
"13516010","13518210"," o'clock into four fifteen."
"13518790","13522910"," You like going Robin Hood by a call at four o'clock and solid at four fifteen."
"13523550","13524450"," I don't think you can. "
"13529830","13530430"," Okay, yeah."
"13530530","13531190"," So there are some rules."
"13531870","13535350"," There shouldn't be any rules, but there are. "
"13538640","13540880"," That complicates your mentality as to right."
"13541100","13543300"," I would assume that that would wait."
"13543520","13548580"," If I was trading Robin Hood zero dates, I'd be like, oh, they have horrible fills in Robin Hood"
"13548580","13548840"," too. "
"13549420","13549820"," Horrible."
"13552520","13555360"," I don't know that I would trade zero dates in Robin Hood if I could."
"13555360","13558780"," If I had a Robin Hood account with money, I don't know if I would that I'd want to. "
"13559620","13562940"," You're talking about three cents and five cents matters."
"13566200","13569820"," I don't like how the website is set up either."
"13570020","13574980"," U.S. natural gas features extend gains in volatile trade up by five percent again. "
"13575820","13576460"," You know what?"
"13576580","13580360"," It might not be about a platform for certain trades."
"13580360","13585600"," I know that they they have a pretty good like you can."
"13585820","13587380"," I think you can execute selling. "
"13587900","13589240"," I could be wrong on this."
"13589780","13596040"," You can set or may you end up in the cell spreads, but you can at least open or buy"
"13596040","13597400"," complex spreads."
"13599800","13600780"," On Robin Hood. "
"13602300","13607460"," It's even still like the way the layout of their just the layout of like buying and selling and"
"13607460","13609600"," then watching the Greeks."
"13610360","13617520"," On your and then then how you watch the options chain is kind of bizarre."
"13617720","13624240"," If you have a chance, you want to try to move out of Robin Hood into a different brokerage. "
"13624320","13626240"," We can always talk about different brokerages."
"13627440","13632540"," I'm not affiliated with any so I'm pretty unbiased here."
"13633420","13635060"," I'm not affiliated with anybody at all. "
"13635060","13637760"," If I ever do have been asked recently have been asked."
"13638600","13647380"," If I would look at some different services and programs and stuff like that."
"13649180","13652400"," But I'm only looking at that stuff in the background, not probably. "
"13677050","13684790"," Yeah, I prefer 101 counter parties take two spot one five two trillion dollars at fed reverse repo"
"13684790","13685490"," operation."
"13686610","13690810"," What I like tasty is because you can open like as many as you want."
"13690910","13692030"," You can open like five ten accounts. "
"13692990","13694610"," So you can sign in and out of them."
"13694710","13698630"," So if you place a trade, let's say you place like a call spread for three months."
"13698650","13702810"," You just put it on one of your accounts and you're not staring at it every day. "
"13703590","13705530"," You're not like it's not right in front of your face."
"13706110","13710550"," Especially like long trades are not long like long the market or long position."
"13711230","13713330"," If you're like, I'm going to put something on for a year. "
"13713490","13715330"," I'm going to put something on or you're going to buy stock."
"13718210","13722070"," Let's see if you buy some stock and you want to manage it over time."
"13722310","13723570"," I just set alerts on this stuff. "
"13724430","13727190"," Key or like about a ten dollars."
"13727370","13729630"," I want to know if it goes to eight dollars or twenty dollars."
"13730750","13733030"," And you set alerts on them and you forget about it. "
"13733470","13734210"," I can't stand."
"13737270","13747090"," I can't stand if I have a five like a I believe in a position where it's"
"13747090","13749090"," going unless it breaks a certain number."
"13749470","13751030"," I don't want to I don't want to look at it every day. "
"13752230","13753350"," I forget about it."
"13753670","13759230"," It auto sells what I wanted to auto sell or at least alerts me as it gets close to a"
"13759230","13759710"," cell opportunity."
"13760310","13760890"," You can do that too. "
"13760890","13762450"," I used to done I used to done that in the past."
"13765110","13767250"," But like look staring and looking at that shit."
"13767390","13767930"," I can't do it. "
"13768190","13769730"," I get crazy."
"13770310","13771750"," I'll start overthinking it."
"13786260","13790280"," Yeah, I like you should not if you're going to do GME stuff like that. "
"13791640","13795200"," And if you ever refer to that stuff, you want to use a prime bank for those trades."
"13797360","13806260"," You want to use like a Schwab or, you know, with a real bank behind it because they can cover"
"13806260","13811240"," that liquidity issue problem that Robin had another order for sellers have."
"13812060","13817920"," And then the other thing to think about is a customer service like support. "
"13820340","13823520"," I'm telling you to trace if you trade any if you ever trade any size."
"13823560","13826100"," If you don't do it now, you don't trade size and you ever do."
"13826840","13828920"," You're going to need customer service at some point. "
"13830360","13831380"," When you're trading size."
"13832720","13834080"," If anything goes wrong."
"13839150","13840770"," You want someone there to talk to. "
"13841750","13843730"," That's one thing I can give for tasty man."
"13844070","13848630"," I'm not affiliated with them in any way shape or form and one thing I can give to tasty is."
"13848630","13852090"," If I have an issue, they answered the phone. "
"13853010","13854990"," It doesn't matter what time of day it is."
"13855970","13858750"," I get somebody who knows my accounts, manages my accounts."
"13860610","13861910"," And they know who I am. "
"13862430","13862550"," So."
"13865390","13871710"," If your broker offers you good customer service like your phone call for two, three rings pick it"
"13871710","13873330"," up nine 30 in the morning."
"13874510","13875530"," We're there for you. "
"13876390","13878010"," There was one thing to give tasty."
"13879350","13881270"," I know there are other good brokers that do that too."
"13881370","13884770"," So if you know any other good brokers that have good customer service, shout them out in the chat,"
"13884950","13885690"," but I'll tell you what. "
"13886330","13887990"," You can't do that with Robinhood."
"13890830","13893090"," You're not calling Robinhood and speaking to somebody."
"13899420","13900280"," Well, that's the thing. "
"13902500","13904060"," It's like a prime bank."
"13904500","13908760"," You only want to use them for buying and selling of physical stock."
"13908760","13911400"," I'm not talking about trading options with. "
"13911940","13915740"," So like GME, you're going to buy and sell GME."
"13916480","13918520"," You don't want liquidity issues."
"13919460","13922980"," I'm talking about physical shares or stock. "
"13927450","13928750"," But trading options."
"13930510","13934810"," I had zero problems trading options."
"13935290","13935690"," Okay. "
"13937550","13939550"," Committed to protect mortgage holders."
"13939930","13944290"," Matter of fact, remember that time when Robinhood was like they were banning stocks, it was like"
"13944290","13946910"," they were just like with like three stocks in the day."
"13946930","13947910"," And so you can't trade these. "
"13947910","13949990"," You can't trade those closing only these positions."
"13950590","13952430"," And they were like rotating through a bunch of a."
"13953410","13956030"," A bunch of pump or not popping up, but meme stocks."
"13957410","13958050"," At that time. "
"13964790","13968990"," There was a window when the women Russia, Russia stocks were going down."
"13969410","13970170"," Tasty was."
"13971430","13974410"," Tasty a lot. "
"13975210","13975770"," Nice."
"13980050","13983090"," You could trade the Russia stocks for like an extra."
"13983390","13986090"," I don't know if it was an extra four hours or an extra eight hours. "
"13987110","13988810"," Tasty was still allowing trading."
"13989270","13989950"," They're like one of the last."
"13992110","13993070"," Brokers to go down. "
"13999790","14000350"," They do."
"14000550","14003230"," So the event is the saying that Robinhood now is phone customer service."
"14003650","14004230"," What did you?"
"14004370","14006770"," What was your experience when you called?"
"14007090","14007750"," Do they help you out?"
"14007970","14008730"," Do they fix your issues?"
"14015160","14016700"," Yeah, I paid for my trades, man. "
"14018640","14019620"," I love Tasty."
"14033860","14040420"," I don't know."
"14042360","14046380"," I think the natural progression for someone that uses Robinhood. "
"14046660","14049800"," Probably they feel they'll feel the safest with Webull."
"14051190","14055960"," I would think like the next step for a new trader is probably Webull."
"14057540","14060000"," You're like, Oh, I don't feel comfortable. "
"14061820","14064540"," Webull is probably the next logical step."
"14067340","14070740"," If in reality, if you had the chance choice, what I would do."
"14071480","14073520"," Is that would open up a bunch of different. "
"14073700","14075440"," I would open up like accounts of Tasty."
"14075700","14077320"," We will open them up."
"14077500","14078900"," I don't know. "
"14080520","14081320"," TD Ameritrade."
"14082260","14083520"," I think a swim account."
"14084000","14084680"," I would just open a bunch. "
"14084800","14086220"," You don't have to fund them all."
"14087660","14088340"," Some you do."
"14088720","14094280"," There's some accounts where you have to come up with like 15, 20 grand, 30 grand. "
"14095360","14096220"," Futures accounts."
"14096880","14100960"," You have to fund most futures accounts, but cash market equity."
"14101720","14102540"," Thank you. "
"14102660","14107940"," And banks have agreed to specific help to specifically help to mortgage borrowers."
"14108400","14111420"," And including extending a loan or lowering monthly payments."
"14111560","14115860"," So just repeat their banks have agreed to offer specific help to mortgage borrowers, including"
"14115860","14118640"," extending a loan or lowering monthly payments. "
"14125880","14130080"," Yeah, I think I can understand the mobile experience of Robinhood."
"14130400","14133680"," I don't think Robinhood is necessarily bad if you're buying and selling stock."
"14134680","14138340"," Or if you're holding positions where it's not timing is not critical. "
"14139140","14144260"," So if you're like, I bought some call spreads and I can close them whenever and I can just pop"
"14144260","14146080"," Robinhood open and do my thing."
"14146220","14146820"," I think that's fine."
"14146820","14153940"," I think if you're, I think if you're timing of your trade, if you're timing your trades. "
"14155220","14159440"," If you're like, so like if you're here with me and you're like, we're like, okay, what we're going"
"14159440","14160200"," to do is we're going to take."
"14160760","14163700"," We're going to buy some spy calls here and we're going to sell them right here."
"14164420","14165240"," I would be. "
"14165740","14169620"," There's no way you're getting a better experience doing this in Robinhood than."
"14170780","14174520"," Then I am right here where I'm standing with my tasty open."
"14174720","14175100"," There's no way. "
"14175660","14179360"," There's no way you're getting a better fulfill and there's no way you're getting faster execution"
"14179360","14182300"," and there's no way that Robinhood you can."
"14182620","14185000"," There's no way that you can track on Robinhood."
"14185860","14190360"," How to get in any positions quickly or add to your positions quickly or close them all quickly. "
"14191420","14192140"," No way."
"14193300","14198480"," No way you beat the speed of the, but that's, but that's, you'd have, I'm talking about trading on"
"14198480","14199880"," a laptop or a desktop."
"14203040","14204760"," Two, I'm not talking about trading on a phone. "
"14206580","14209880"," Tastes a phone app kind of sucks."
"14215280","14217860"," I'll say that it does kind of suck, but I don't trade by phone."
"14218000","14219580"," I trade, I always trade at a desk. "
"14225860","14233160"," Yeah, that's what I'm saying."
"14233160","14235960"," It's a really fast directional moves."
"14236480","14236920"," I don't know. "
"14237040","14237800"," I'd be scared to death."
"14239260","14239900"," I'd be scared."
"14245270","14246670"," No, this is a weebel. "
"14246930","14250330"," So I'll try, I'll try everything."
"14250670","14252010"," I'll go out there and I'll try stuff."
"14252490","14253490"," And if I like it, I'll use it. "
"14254070","14256410"," So market data is expensive."
"14257270","14258270"," It costs a lot of money."
"14259430","14266930"," And then every, every, like, you know, a book map has its own data that you pay for. "
"14268370","14272470"," You can't, well, you can pay for different types of some data is free and some data you pay and"
"14272470","14273570"," you pay more for more data."
"14275310","14280710"," Sometimes your trading app will have good data or you pay for data, but the app might suck or the"
"14280710","14281430"," charting might suck."
"14281430","14287550"," Like I prefer research on trading view, live market data. "
"14288670","14292290"," I love the speed of weebel, a love book map."
"14294370","14297170"," For executing my trades, I like to execute them and tasty."
"14297690","14303790"," So I use different software for different things that I'm trying to do. "
"14303790","14309870"," Like there might be like something that that a trading view does very well and then something that"
"14309870","14311150"," book map does very well."
"14311570","14313750"," Light speed might do something very well."
"14314190","14318470"," I still use options AI to set up fast trades. "
"14318770","14325090"," I don't trade there, but I have used them to quickly figure out"
"14325090","14331210"," how much I can make on a trade."
"14331210","14338730"," Or I use it for research too, like I'll sometimes post options.ai graphs on Twitter."
"14341170","14346370"," Just to get people an idea, hey, this is an idea what can happen if you take this trade, if"
"14346370","14347570"," it was right now at this moment. "
"14348970","14353710"," So I think every service has their really shiny parts, right?"
"14353950","14355530"," You're like, they do this very well."
"14360090","14362650"," It's the same thing, like positive like spot gamma."
"14362890","14364770"," We were talking about some of the negatives about spot gamma. "
"14365290","14366910"," Spot gamma's got some great stuff."
"14367410","14370170"," I can't say spot gamma doesn't have some great stuff."
"14371530","14373210"," It makes all these different services. "
"14373470","14377270"," They put it where they shine if you can take that and use it."
"14377730","14381270"," So the reason why I use weebel with you guys is number one, it's free data."
"14382190","14385570"," But number two, I've run it against paid data. "
"14385570","14390150"," And it's maybe three milliseconds slower."
"14390690","14395050"," But for free data charts, they're probably the fastest out there."
"14395590","14403570"," It's like where weebel isn't the best, like weebels, what do they call their drawing sets and"
"14403570","14404550"," drawing charts?"
"14404870","14406190"," They kind of suck, right?"
"14406970","14408090"," It's really basic, right?"
"14409050","14412390"," Like their tools and stuff, they're really kind of sketchy. "
"14414030","14420230"," But market information, if you have five or six screeners at home and you throw up just a simple"
"14420230","14426250"," candlestick chart, and you're not paying for that data, weebel all day long."
"14426930","14436850"," Probably the best free data that you can get in terms of speed in which that data is made"
"14436850","14437570"," available to you."
"14437570","14441690"," I don't know how they're paying for it and I don't know why they're not charging people for it, but"
"14441690","14442830"," it's fucking awesome. "
"14445050","14451690"," If everything that weebels sucks, weebel kind of sucks, but their data feed is outstanding."
"14454010","14455610"," I'd put it up against any paid data."
"14462360","14464660"," Yeah, I didn't know that they were moving chat in a month. "
"14465300","14469280"," So are they going to remove, who's the guy that's the trader on in the morning?"
"14471440","14473720"," So thinkorswim used to have trade the news."
"14474220","14475560"," They dumped that, right?"
"14475760","14477480"," Then they have trade the news and then they dumped it."
"14477680","14478640"," They used to offer it for free. "
"14480360","14482200"," Can you still pay for trade the news on?"
"14482480","14483200"," I didn't even think of that."
"14483500","14485260"," I have to go check that out and see if I can buy it."
"14487000","14488920"," I know they used to have free trade the news. "
"14489500","14493120"," I think it was like a small delay, like five seconds or something or ten seconds."
"14494740","14498520"," Floyd's garage or masking you specifically, if you know."
"14499900","14503440"," And thinkorswim used to have that guy out in the morning. "
"14503580","14504360"," They're getting rid of him too."
"14505480","14506120"," What's his name?"
"14506920","14508640"," He has a trading show."
"14509060","14512300"," Isn't he on till like 10.30 in the morning or 10.45 or 11.30?"
"14515730","14516750"," Yeah, shadow trader. "
"14517470","14518470"," That's not shadow trader though."
"14518610","14518790"," Is it?"
"14519010","14520350"," Is that like his partner or something?"
"14521330","14522510"," Is there like two of them?"
"14524130","14525050"," No, no, not Peter."
"14526010","14527570"," I know who Peter is. "
"14529790","14530950"," Good afternoon, Omar."
"14531690","14533490"," I thought I know Peter."
"14533670","14533870"," Yeah. "
"14535390","14536450"," Yeah, Peter has to check."
"14536550","14540030"," I know who he is, but I thought there's another guy that was on there in the morning that wasn't"
"14540030","14540270"," Peter."
"14542980","14543900"," Or is that Peter?"
"14547320","14551480"," Are they still doing a morning audio show or are you saying they're canceling their morning audio"
"14551480","14551840"," show?"
"14558760","14559940"," Yeah, Brad or scooter. "
"14560220","14564180"," Are they going to cancel all of their morning shows or are they keeping that aspect?"
"14570500","14571940"," You want to take a look at GME?"
"14574800","14576420"," You all want to take a look at GME?"
"14577060","14579880"," If GME rips here, you should see the spider."
"14580000","14580680"," Do you guys know that?"
"14583300","14584880"," Have you guys been correlating?"
"14585220","14587100"," Let's do something really cool right now."
"14587100","14593460"," So you've got James rolling 17 in the house right now, joining us, stopping by to say hello. "
"14594200","14596280"," He's asking us if we're going to buy GME."
"14596520","14598780"," So we're going to do, we're going to do some clip and want to do."
"14600360","14601440"," I haven't done it. "
"14601820","14607000"," So maybe, maybe James can, James, you want to tell us what's up?"
"14607400","14607700"," Like what's?"
"14612020","14613700"," Holy shit, they're canceling it all."
"14619280","14623860"," Yeah, is that Ben's recording when the flash crash in 2010?"
"14623860","14625320"," That was great recording, by the way."
"14627580","14628680"," That is canceling. "
"14629860","14631720"," They've been here all day, James, right on."
"14634800","14640980"," Okay, so let's look at, let me see if you can find a correlation here."
"14641080","14646560"," There's been some talk recently of, I don't know what they were doing with it. "
"14647620","14652060"," Someone was talking about some correlation between Spy and GME or AMC."
"14654620","14655860"," I don't know what it is."
"14656460","14658540"," I haven't been meaning to look at it. "
"14667150","14668610"," Wait a minute, hold on here."
"14669410","14670670"," AMC, GME."
"14672230","14672690"," Same scale. "
"14674850","14676070"," And AMC, same scale."
"14676630","14677690"," See if you can find any kind of correlation."
"14678030","14678230"," Let's look. "
"14690880","14693780"," Or they've been correlating more than they haven't been, right?"
"14694280","14695180"," That's what it seems like."
"14696960","14700880"," Look at those spikes right there, right?"
"14706780","14708220"," Giant moves right there."
"14712140","14713900"," Let's see if we can go on a..."
"14723730","14724650"," Am I buying?"
"14725850","14727890"," They're kind of correlating with the market now. "
"14728310","14729110"," These did not correlate."
"14729650","14732470"," GME and AMC used to go up when the market was going down."
"14732650","14733250"," You guys remember that?"
"14739160","14741340"," The more violent moves now too, right?"
"14741600","14742620"," Deeper, deeper moves. "
"14743020","14744700"," I mean, that could be really bad for GME."
"14747040","14748740"," How low is GME right now?"
"14753190","14754470"," Big moves though, right?"
"14764900","14766680"," This is what I would say to you then."
"14766680","14776280"," If this more correlated moves in GME, James, I would say to you what we've been talking about here"
"14776280","14778920"," past one here. "
"14781460","14788740"," So into the bottoming process yesterday, we were saying that's possible."
"14789200","14793120"," We don't know when the shorts will come off for a squeeze higher."
"14797000","14799920"," You're going to expect something between now and Saturday. "
"14803100","14805360"," So I would think..."
"14805360","14808540"," So the smart money is down here on the spy."
"14810660","14812080"," The smart money is down here."
"14814300","14818300"," I don't know if this buy, the smart money buy was down here or not. "
"14818880","14824740"," What I would recommend is doing an overlay where I would be looking at the spy for some weakness"
"14824740","14826580"," for the rest of the week."
"14828140","14830860"," If we don't tag R1, right?"
"14831220","14832360"," This would be the rules, right?"
"14832500","14839500"," If we don't tag R1 today directly, if we don't grind up and hit R1, I would say to you"
"14839500","14847760"," look for at least some moment between now and Monday if we can get down here without hitting R1."
"14847760","14853040"," If we sell off and bleed off at any point, I'd be a buyer of GME. "
"14853680","14856320"," I'd be buying calls that are dated for Monday."
"14858280","14859840"," It doesn't mean we don't go there right now."
"14861920","14865120"," My rule here would be that you would wait for this here. "
"14869140","14871320"," It seems like there's more correlation with GME now, right?"
"14875660","14877420"," Maybe I'm missing what you're saying."
"14885840","14889200"," You found out that a Seder owns GME shares."
"14892540","14895000"," You guys can go back and check my Twitter history. "
"14895360","14905080"," So before GME was anything, it was like the end of the Golden Age for"
"14905080","14910920"," just coming into the end of the Golden Age for Wall Street Bets."
"14910920","14915640"," It was a really, really tight group of people."
"14919660","14921420"," It was a great community. "
"14923340","14923940"," It's a great community."
"14923940","14924520"," It's a no other way to say it."
"14924680","14930380"," You have groups cycling out of that community, but there was a core group of probably 3,000 people"
"14930380","14934180"," that were active day or daily users, 3,000 to 5,000 people. "
"14934440","14943140"," I mean, there's more people in the group in Wall Street Bets at that time, but it's all changed the"
"14943140","14943960"," whole different thing now."
"14944460","14952590"," But you're talking about, it was really wild and that happened."
"14952950","14958570"," I have a lot of feelings and thoughts and emotions about it because so much has changed with so"
"14958570","14961050"," much has changed. "
"14961350","14962570"," I remember when we were here at $21."
"14963290","14964470"," I remember we were at $25."
"14964990","14965790"," I remember we were at $12. "
"14967410","14971840"," Yeah, it's an historical place, right?"
"14972160","14979900"," It's most certainly is like $4 right here."
"14980100","14982100"," I remember this original pump, man."
"14982340","14982740"," Not this pump. "
"14983020","14983220"," Hold on."
"14984120","14991900"," It was like, we started laughing like rips in the previous year and there was like a coffin of,"
"14993940","14995820"," hey, man, maybe these guys are right."
"14996660","14997120"," You know?"
"15002030","15012280"," But this"
"15012280","15013840"," is before anyone knew anything. "
"15014260","15015820"," It was such a small community."
"15016900","15025580"," And then I remember being on Twitter and when the original rise happened, I remember Twitter bros"
"15025580","15031570"," were like, I remember like somewhere back in here."
"15032670","15034490"," There was another rip I think before. "
"15035490","15039150"," Yeah, right up in here there was one way back in December."
"15040070","15042950"," This was like where the original excitement started in."
"15044130","15048450"," If I don't cut this wrong, but I think there was like the initial rip and then it came back"
"15048450","15050810"," down and people got really fucking scared in Wall Street Bets. "
"15051510","15053430"," And then I remember when it started ripping further along."
"15056670","15062530"," I remember we were posted on Twitter and we were like, this is before it got picked up by any"
"15062530","15064150"," news or anyone picked up."
"15064350","15067990"," I can't further anybody in Wall Street Bets for anything happened. "
"15069150","15073590"," And I remember like the people were getting trapped in here and they were like, where's it going to"
"15073590","15073850"," go to?"
"15076600","15082680"," And we knew then, we knew before the public knew, we knew before the fucking newspapers knew,"
"15082820","15085960"," before the fucking CNBC didn't matter."
"15086200","15090140"," Before fucking, there was no apes, there was no like none of that stuff."
"15091100","15097000"," And I think as I remember it, people were like asking like, well, how can it go cap?"
"15097180","15100660"," And I was like, oh, I was like, there's no ceiling. "
"15100940","15101860"," They put a ceiling on it."
"15103140","15104180"," There is a ceiling now."
"15104980","15106520"," But at the time there wasn't. "
"15109240","15111500"," And we were like, they're going to have to shut it down."
"15111740","15113300"," There's no, they're going to have no choice."
"15113380","15114520"," People thought we were crazy then. "
"15115720","15120340"," It was like, there was like people were making, then they started making fun of people that were"
"15120340","15121080"," long in GMA."
"15121240","15123220"," And we all knew, we were all like, oh, no, this fucking thing."
"15123900","15125280"," This thing's going to pull a fucking Volkswagen. "
"15125280","15130340"," Like this thing is going to pull a fucking Volkswagen, hands fucking down, or they're going to shut"
"15130340","15131360"," the fucking stock down."
"15132100","15133460"," And people were like, oh, I can't go."
"15133580","15135540"," I was like, I don't know, 100 bucks. "
"15135920","15137360"," And people were like, is that the highest?"
"15137580","15137960"," I'm like, no."
"15138520","15139040"," What do you want?"
"15139280","15139880"," What do we have throughout there?"
"15139960","15140080"," 300?"
"15141020","15141140"," 500?"
"15142020","15142060"," 2000?"
"15143560","15143980"," $3,000?"
"15144700","15146200"," They have no way to shut the shit down."
"15147220","15148440"," And people were like, you're fucking crazy. "
"15148500","15149020"," It's not true."
"15149640","15150260"," And I'm like, no, no, no."
"15150380","15151900"," We get this guy that's like teaching us all this shit. "
"15154840","15156400"," There's no way for them to stop it."
"15156440","15158380"," It's a fucking runaway train."
"15159240","15160340"," And then people didn't believe it. "
"15160580","15168100"," And then as it started running up, I remember like, I remember like in here somewhere."
"15169620","15171620"," People are like, there's no fucking way it's getting up here."
"15171860","15173440"," And like, I remember it was coming down. "
"15174440","15176180"," Like people on Twitter that started getting angry."
"15176500","15179300"," Like always fucking Twitter bros were like, say never happening."
"15181380","15182900"," And I'm like, oh, it's happening. "
"15184260","15186240"," I'm like, there's nothing stopping this fucking train."
"15187540","15187940"," Nothing."
"15188780","15190600"," You guys know the whole like Volkswagen story?"
"15193180","15195740"," I knew we knew about the Volkswagen story back here. "
"15196840","15198680"," We knew exactly what was going to happen here."
"15199440","15202480"," And we knew that there was nothing they could do unless they shut it down."
"15204340","15208440"," And then by the time you're in here, like this day, when this was going on, this shit that was"
"15208440","15210740"," going on in here, and then dude, it wasn't the end. "
"15212300","15212700"," Right?"
"15215220","15217420"," And then it just started blasting up again."
"15217740","15219220"," People were like, this isn't going to happen again."
"15219680","15225780"," Matter of fact, in here, if you go back to like Twitter history, these fucking people in here, like"
"15225780","15226920"," Twitter was like, oh, good. "
"15227040","15228280"," We can get back to regular trading again."
"15228440","15229320"," This is never happening again."
"15230280","15234320"," And it fucking slammed back up again and fucking slammed back up again. "
"15237240","15238860"," And then it fucking ramped up."
"15239040","15241320"," I think it was just fucking pure insanity."
"15242460","15243660"," Pure fucking insanity. "
"15244800","15248180"," Just look at this fucking monster moves."
"15250340","15250780"," 204."
"15251900","15252560"," Look at that. "
"15253240","15255020"," Just fucking beast move mode in it."
"15256460","15258200"," So yeah, is this an important place?"
"15258540","15260100"," It is very important place."
"15261740","15263180"," I would trade it against the spy. "
"15263880","15265200"," I wouldn't believe anything in here out there."
"15265280","15265860"," It's going to rip again."
"15266760","15268060"," It'll be a nice little rip coming up. "
"15270280","15278000"," It was crazy because no one, so if you were one of maybe, you were probably like one of maybe"
"15278000","15281540"," three to 5,000 people that knew all of it."
"15281840","15285420"," Then there was like maybe another 10 to 15,000 people."
"15285640","15287760"," It was really weird of the three to 5,000 people. "
"15287840","15290300"," There was like, I was on the, I don't believe this."
"15290820","15292160"," I was like, we'll make it a rip 20."
"15292440","15293100"," This is early, right?"
"15293900","15294560"," We'll make it 20. "
"15294560","15296700"," Then we got, I think we got 23 or 25 or something."
"15297560","15299200"," And everybody's like, I'm taking the money and running."
"15299640","15301860"," And then of course we start ramping amongst the group. "
"15302040","15305660"," Now you've got like 3,000 people that are like, I think we can, I think this guy's got a"
"15305660","15305900"," point."
"15306140","15307180"," We're going to fucking rip it up, right?"
"15307440","15311920"," But you're still totally talking like three, 5,000 people in the world that knows this is"
"15311920","15312300"," happening."
"15312880","15318060"," And then, and then even when we started ramp, like we even when GME started ramping, you're talking"
"15318060","15321560"," about like a cacophony of people that are not even with you. "
"15321680","15322400"," They're just against you."
"15322760","15323940"," We don't even have apes yet."
"15324400","15325680"," We just have people saying no. "
"15326080","15330660"," And that's the crazy part about that top when it started ramping up to that 500 fucking dollars at"
"15330660","15331220"," that point."
"15331780","15332980"," It was over."
"15334060","15335340"," It was over two reasons. "
"15335580","15337880"," They were going to definitely, they were definitely going to make it over."
"15340480","15341960"," They were, oh, it's already turned."
"15342160","15343300"," The GME's already turned around. "
"15343460","15344400"," You guys see that right now?"
"15345060","15347020"," Look at that GME 2197."
"15348460","15350060"," Big old bounce down here."
"15352520","15358260"," It was so wild because if you were, if you knew it, so if you already knew the entire story,"
"15358320","15364360"," if you'd watched the videos, if you had been in the conversations in Wall Street bets, right?"
"15365140","15371080"," And then, of course, you've get the, like then seeing it evolve, like seeing like the down talking"
"15371080","15375620"," that this ain't going any higher and then people get getting all people that don't know it. "
"15375680","15377140"," People don't know why it's going up."
"15377260","15379140"," People don't even know why it's not going to stop."
"15379140","15383540"," People are coming up with all these crazy fucking lunatic answers. "
"15383880","15388160"," Like, these are like smart people, like hedge funds telling you this isn't going to happen."
"15388560","15393840"," And people listening to hedge funds, the smart money on Twitter saying don't listen to that hedge"
"15393840","15394120"," fund."
"15394300","15395940"," Don't listen to these fucking crazy kids. "
"15396300","15397340"," And this, this isn't no apes."
"15397500","15399480"," This isn't like, there's no 15,000."
"15399560","15400580"," There's no 50,000. "
"15400680","15401600"," There's no million people."
"15402160","15403880"," This is like three to 5,000 people."
"15404520","15405120"," That's it. "
"15405940","15406660"," That's it."
"15407300","15410060"," Now, that's not the five when I hit 500."
"15410340","15413720"," This was like the ramp into $100, right?"
"15414000","15415400"," And then it comes back down. "
"15415540","15416860"," It's like pulsing beating."
"15417180","15419440"," And we're like, they have no idea what's coming."
"15419620","15420840"," We're like, they have no fucking clue. "
"15421340","15427640"," If you guys, if any of you guys traded GME from the beginning when it was under sub 100 bucks,"
"15428000","15429760"," do you have no fucking idea?"
"15430600","15431440"," You'd be sitting in there."
"15431580","15433980"," Be sitting in the fucking options chain, right?"
"15433980","15437660"," And as it would fucking, it would just fucking shut down, start back up."
"15438080","15440460"," And you could like slam fucking 20 grand in there. "
"15440760","15443140"," And it would just fucking go, whoosh."
"15444780","15446260"," There was nothing like it."
"15447340","15448940"," There was nothing like it. "
"15449060","15452160"," It was the most heart pounding, fucking crazy."
"15453800","15457800"," In the beginning of it, people were like, they'd go in with like 10 grand or 20 grand."
"15458340","15461800"," It would go down your fucking, you'd go down to like, it'd be worth like five grand. "
"15462420","15465440"," A thousand bucks and then rocket ship up to $100,000."
"15466260","15470680"," And you initially people were like, oh, should I just last 19 grand?"
"15470860","15471480"," I'm going to close my position."
"15473840","15475780"," And then you're like, boom, I just lost 19 grand. "
"15475920","15478340"," But then you'd be looking at the options chain and we'll go back up to 100 grand."
"15478500","15480060"," You're like, holy fuck if I had just held."
"15480800","15482380"," So you just go in there as it's rampant. "
"15482380","15484140"," And you're like, I don't care where I fucking buy."
"15484560","15486060"," I know that mother fucker is going to go up."
"15486660","15489840"," Another fucking, you know, 3000% in the next 15 minutes. "
"15490480","15491120"," That's true."
"15491380","15492480"," That really happened."
"15494400","15498720"," And then you got the ramp of like, who went from like 3000 to 15,000 people. "
"15498840","15502820"," And then it just started exponentially fucking like, you know, you're talking about 300,000 people,"
"15502880","15505900"," million people, 5 million people that spread and fire around the world."
"15505900","15509860"," And, you know, if you were there in the beginning of that time, but as they were coming into that"
"15509860","15513360"," 500, it was already talk of they're going to shut the shit down."
"15513760","15518440"," And Wall Street bats, there's like an inflot of people subscribing to Wall Street bats, right?"
"15518440","15520220"," No one knew who anybody was. "
"15520980","15526640"," And then it was like, um, it was really bizarre too because it was like, um, and this is my"
"15526640","15527860"," or at least how I recall it."
"15528000","15529080"," I could be wrong in some of this stuff."
"15529100","15530900"," This is my perception of what was going on. "
"15532060","15534700"," I remember that I was like, they're going to shut it down."
"15535020","15538400"," They know and it's only going to take at the time."
"15538400","15541940"," I think I was like, ah, maybe in a week or three days or five days, they're going to figure"
"15541940","15542240"," it out. "
"15542460","15544880"," And they're going to light everybody and tell them it's not going up in the background."
"15544880","15546160"," They're going to shut this shit down."
"15546160","15549740"," And that first time they shut it down, that was the end. "
"15552360","15553880"," And for me, that's when it was over."
"15554500","15556440"," And that's when I walked away and it got crazier."
"15556760","15558480"," It got crazy with people, it got crazy with movement. "
"15559440","15566280"," Um, they were, the OGs that were in Wall Street bats were telling people not the fucking chase GME."
"15566680","15570580"," People would come into the sub be like, I'm this, I'm that big war started."
"15571520","15574380"," I remember when they started calling each other apes and all that shit. "
"15574380","15576700"," They would do original apes."
"15577500","15578180"," They were shit on."
"15578920","15583040"," They were shit on until they overpowered the sub, the subreddit. "
"15583280","15584080"," Sorry, that's what it was."
"15584320","15584980"," That is the truth."
"15586680","15589460"," This is before the rise of, uh, of the apes. "
"15594260","15598680"," So anyways, it's not that we didn't believe in it."
"15598780","15601140"," It was that the, you had two different classes of people."
"15602560","15608600"," We had the people that like were original, uh, and then of course the apes hate the original GME"
"15608600","15615060"," gang because, um, which I understand why because it became a movement for people became a fight"
"15615060","15621840"," against the power became a fight against order flow, became a fight against everything that's wrong"
"15621840","15625620"," with the stock market, everything's wrong with money, right?"
"15625620","15633740"," For people, savings for people, raise larger issues, social issues, economic, social, economic"
"15633740","15635620"," issues, social class issues, all that kind of stuff. "
"15636580","15640740"," Uh, the fake market, manipulative market, all that kind of stuff raised a whole bunch of legitimate"
"15640740","15649280"," answers or raised a whole bunch of legitimate concerns, but, um, so now, of course, the, the"
"15649280","15651480"," original GME gang was like, we're out of here."
"15654400","15662970"," And, uh, most still hold positions in GME, believe it or not."
"15663770","15672610"," There are a lot of GME holders to this day that hold right around some, I know some guys held"
"15672610","15674070"," it like five or six, some had it. "
"15674870","15679010"," Twelve dollars, another big number, sixteen dollars, a big number and twenty one dollars, I think,"
"15679350","15684930"," twenty five dollars was another big number for the original people that were buying GME."
"15685350","15692090"," So they are, they are significant levels for OG holders that never sold."
"15692870","15695970"," Um, dude, there were times people were showing their holdings. "
"15696110","15703010"," They were like people are just posting snapshots, uh, like, immigrants, um, of their holdings at"
"15703010","15703730"," those low prices."
"15704530","15705270"," It was really wild."
"15708940","15709920"," You were there, you were too. "
"15712420","15715500"," It took over almost, that was the day, that was the day Wall Street Bets died."
"15717020","15718460"," That was the day Wall Street Bets died."
"15719200","15721820"," In my view, I know some of you guys don't think it ever died. "
"15722300","15726980"," In my view that, it's funny too, because the mods will always be like, you know, every three or"
"15726980","15727740"," four years we hear that."
"15728720","15731980"," You know, it's not the same Wall Street Bets as it was in the past."
"15732160","15733540"," And it did change over time. "
"15734620","15738880"," But of all the years of Wall Street Bets, to me, that was the time, that was when Wall Street"
"15738880","15739280"," Bets died."
"15739280","15741800"," It was a very sad moment."
"15742020","15747040"," It was too many people, too, just too many people, too many people. "
"15755790","15757250"," It became absurd."
"15757510","15758410"," And it was wild too."
"15758670","15759990"," If you were there in the beginning, right?"
"15760110","15766930"," The absolute beginning with what was most wild about it was, uh, it was rejected. "
"15767570","15769310"," It was rejected from normal people."
"15769490","15771590"," It was the concept of this was reject."
"15771870","15774850"," Even when it started ramp, it was rejected from people. "
"15774850","15778330"," It was rejected by, dude, you had high follow Twitter accounts that were rejecting it."
"15778650","15780470"," It was like everybody was rejecting this."
"15780590","15781550"," Like, no, no, no, no. "
"15781870","15787570"," And as it started to snowball and snowball and snowball and snowball, um, you watching like people"
"15787570","15789390"," switch and roll in."
"15789710","15793590"," And it was really, it was, it was, it wasn't like a bad or good."
"15793790","15801870"," It was just very, um, uh, I think the experience was like, um, like a Twilight Zone episode or"
"15801870","15802150"," something. "
"15802150","15804130"," In real life."
"15804650","15807170"," If you're, if you're, if you're privy and witness to it happening."
"15808350","15810410"," From the absolute beginning, it was really bizarre. "
"15810750","15812230"," It was a really bizarre thing to watch."
"15818230","15819250"," No, it hasn't been the same."
"15819370","15819850"," But they've tried. "
"15820110","15821170"," I think recently."
"15822310","15826270"," I go back in there every once in a while now and it's gotten better."
"15827570","15829750"," Uh, the sites becomes some, it's. "
"15830550","15833690"," If there was a like a peak, I fucking hate Wall Street bets."
"15834370","15839350"," Seems like that time in Wall Street bets is over seems like it's trying to go back."

"16560630","16561689"," Ah, they're still selling."
"16562810","16564680"," So you got like, get them buyers."
"16564800","16565880"," Original buyers right here. "
"16566840","16568619"," Another set of buyers right here."
"16570000","16571580"," Making an attempt right here."
"16571939","16573860"," Not a bad idea to make a position here. "
"16574759","16575800"," It's not a bad place."
"16577180","16580080"," It's like one, two, three rocket ship."
"16581800","16586400"," If you were a bow, this is probably the best trade you could have taken today and then maybe add"
"16586400","16587180"," some down here. "
"16587939","16594000"," I don't know if we get down here, but this is the best trade right here."
"16595939","16598340"," Although this could be a springboard if it holds."
"16598680","16602800"," If it doesn't hold, if this holds, it's going to fucking, this shit rocket ship. "
"16605619","16609060"," But this is the safest trade down here."
"16612560","16624119"," You know, the other thing to consider is that this"
"16624119","16626300"," is another big thing right here, right?"
"16626439","16626840"," We got the low."
"16627980","16629439"," We got this low right here. "
"16631930","16633250"," Just come back down here."
"16634509","16637710"," I think about that today, right?"
"16637890","16639430"," We've got the lower low yesterday."
"16639970","16643070"," This kind of counts, but kind of doesn't. "
"16644590","16647410"," People will say this doesn't count."
"16649390","16654730"," Bears really do want to see at least this today in an actual cash market."
"16656070","16660810"," Bears want to see right the new low and they want to see the lower lower low, right?"
"16662970","16664169"," You guys understand those concepts. "
"16664470","16666430"," You don't want to see a lower or a higher low."
"16667570","16672330"," So if you're a bull, you want to see this low and you want to see this be the low"
"16672330","16672790"," in the day."
"16673590","16674830"," This implies a move higher. "
"16676210","16685390"," If you're bearish, you want to see a new low or even just right here in the actual cash market."
"16686689","16693090"," Some people will say this is cash market right here, but the truth is with a lot of liquidity,"
"16693090","16695730"," you'd rather see it this right here, even if we go higher."
"16696610","16701310"," So you get the previous low, a new low, right?"
"16705669","16710570"," If we don't get a new low into the close here today, it's bullish. "
"16714000","16720259"," Even if it's only on a temporary basis for a few days, it's bullish."
"16730160","16732680"," Not a lot going on right now, it's just in like pause mode, right?"
"16737480","16739380"," Still more sellers than buyers right now."
"16742580","16745820"," Still more buyers than sellers are still more sellers than buyers. "
"16751540","16753720"," Smart money is still down here hanging out waiting."
"16758740","16760140"," They haven't moved up either."
"16763220","16764960"," Smart money is just like fuck you. "
"16765040","16766419"," I'll stay down here and wait for you."
"16769570","16773630"," It doesn't mean that smart money is going to get doesn't mean that it's eventually going there."
"16773770","16782750"," But if you're a smart trader, you want high, high conviction trades that'll print for you. "
"16791700","16793280"," Probably a fair chance we get down here."
"16806400","16807700"," Get down here."
"16811710","16815130"," Show me where I meet Kevin Todd touched you. "
"16816890","16818870"," Show me where I meet Kevin touched you."
"16822170","16823670"," Do you touch you in the bad place?"
"16826510","16830430"," I shouldn't say that."
"16830710","16831150"," That's cruel. "
"16833550","16836050"," That's really nice."
"16841830","16843150"," Oh, look at that right there."
"16847260","16848960"," It's kind of a dickhead thing to say. "
"16849060","16849720"," I shouldn't have said that."
"16850300","16852320"," I truly do apologize for saying that."
"16853160","16854180"," It's unbecoming. "
"16859660","16865240"," Brent Oil erases all 2022 gains and falls to the lowest since December 2021."
"16868410","16870150"," I might be wanting to buy that."
"16870770","16872170"," Let's look at Brent's oil. "
"16874470","16876670"," Here I look at all you guys are watching the main page."
"16876670","16879210"," So what I'll do is I'll go to the I'll look at a off screen."
"16881050","16882290"," Let's look at Brent Oil. "
"16886340","16887660"," Is it time to buy Brent?"
"16891820","16892940"," Thanks for the heads up."
"16894800","16895720"," What do we got going on?"
"16895880","16897980"," Dude, 2543."
"16898600","16907620"," You know what to be the cool part about Brent buying Brent Oil down here is that you could sell"
"16907620","16910340"," outside the money puts on it all day long at some point, right?"
"16913550","16914770"," Just sell puts on it. "
"16915450","16919690"," It doesn't matter if it doesn't come back up."
"16922940","16926220"," All that matters is that you're selling something that it's never going to attain."
"16928300","16929640"," Here we go guys. "
"16930160","16932980"," We're actually through the buy zone."
"16934940","16936540"," Let me bring it up here for you real quick."
"16938980","16941140"," Let's see if I can put it up here for you. "
"16943200","16945260"," So this is our buy zone down here."
"16946120","16947080"," Well, you can't see this."
"16947220","16947420"," Hold on. "
"16952700","16953860"," We've broken support."
"16955560","16958320"," So this is this is kind of this is the buy zone we had."
"16960700","16966500"," I think I bought it back here and back here. "
"16966660","16967640"," I took these two trades."
"16968640","16969860"," I never bought this though."
"16972000","16976460"," Um, I haven't tried to buy anything past week or so. "
"16978620","16979220"," Wow."
"16979780","16981100"," How low can it go?"
"16981660","16983400"," It's in a death file right now."
"16995800","16999940"," $24.92. Let's see if this matches up anything in the back. "
"17001620","17011970"," $24.87. Let's look, uh,"
"17012590","17013830"," see if that nope."
"17014170","17014890"," Yeah, kind of."
"17016010","17017230"," It's kind of in here. "
"17019770","17022370"," Push up actually right here."
"17023690","17025210"," There's another one right there."
"17027930","17031430"," Push up right there. "
"17035940","17036500"," Right."
"17037280","17041820"," I'm down another push up right here broke that support."
"17049510","17050550"," Somewhere in here. "
"17053090","17058910"," Price target $24.39. I don't know if it'll go there, but I think that's easily attainable."
"17061170","17062370"," Easily attainable."
"17063090","17066270"," Get another level of push up right here. "
"17070740","17072120"," That was a push up."
"17072720","17082040"," That was a push up right there."
"17082540","17085020"," Oh man. "
"17088280","17093960"," Up, up, up, up, up."
"17094400","17095480"," Rankin."
"17115470","17116170"," Let's look. "
"17118750","17120270"," Push up right there."
"17121050","17123530"," Dude, look at that fucking monster push."
"17123530","17131330"," I mean, real support on real supporter of Brent oil. "
"17131670","17134290"," You guys, it's low as fuck."
"17149790","17151610"," Real supporter of Brent oil."
"17157110","17157790"," $19. "
"17160550","17162330"," That's real support down there."
"17163710","17164390"," Push."
"17166770","17166770"," Push. "
"17167670","17167670"," Push."
"17168590","17168890"," Hey, push."
"17169510","17170630"," Can we sell all that off?"
"17171150","17177530"," Come back down to where your original position was was down here at 19 dollars. "
"17181150","17183110"," That is super sketchy."
"17195710","17198550"," Like real support on Brent oil."
"17198990","17200250"," 19 dollars. "
"17200890","17204710"," I don't know if it gets there."
"17204790","17219620"," I don't think that it does, but oh,"
"17219620","17219900"," he did."
"17220380","17221480"," He said oil was about to crash. "
"17222580","17225500"," Yeah, there's an argument made for it."
"17227480","17228360"," There's an argument."
"17228660","17229600"," It's crashing right now. "
"17230620","17239060"," B&O, which is, I'm actually surprised on B&O because Brent oil tends to be a little more stable"
"17239060","17244820"," than a, I mean, this is a, this is a crash."
"17246160","17250260"," Why isn't, why isn't my, uh, the hell's going on down here?"
"17251220","17255220"," My charting is, my charting hasn't updated to this instance yet."
"17257540","17258420"," I'll have to bring it on. "
"17260200","17261020"," Sometimes it updates."
"17261260","17261940"," Sometimes it doesn't."
"17263140","17265560"," Let me see if I can bring it back up here. "
"17265940","17275300"," It, when you start to see a breakdown, I mean, this breakdown should get bought, but, uh, it's,"
"17275300","17277220"," it's having a structural breakdown right now."
"17281560","17284740"," Um, it's, it's, it's definitely having a structural breakdown."
"17292970","17298110"," In real support is, push it up higher. "
"17300470","17302570"," Push right here, push right here."
"17302630","17307210"," This is where, this is where real support is, 19 dollars, 100 percent."
"17307850","17308650"," He's probably right. "
"17308890","17310410"," I would say Bob Kendall is probably right."
"17312210","17316830"," Um, and this structural move here, this, I mean, this, this move is easy to erase."
"17318290","17321870"," There's nothing holding this up. "
"17322410","17323170"," There's some in here."
"17324050","17332800"," I guess you could put, um, um, maybe"
"17332800","17342060"," this would be your first, uh, you would dollar cost average from here, 2250 or so."
"17343100","17346000"," You might start dollar cost averaging into a position. "
"17346200","17350300"," I wouldn't be a fucking buyer though until, until it started to stabilize."
"17351420","17353840"," That's the problem is there's no real point in buying this dip."
"17355460","17358860"," You'd want to like let it consolidate and start to get bullish again. "
"17359360","17360480"," There's nothing to buy here."
"17361200","17363040"," Nothing I can say that's worth buying."
"17376500","17377820"," It's not even worth buying it. "
"17380400","17383580"," Now that it's, now that it has structural damage, what's the point?"
"17383840","17386600"," You can just watch it fix itself and then consolidate."
"17387080","17388960"," Then you can maybe enter a position there."
"17389760","17390960"," There's no real point in buying it. "
"17390960","17394780"," Is there unless you're maybe expecting a space for per hire?"
"17398420","17400680"," If anything, that looks very shortable."
"17421040","17422860"," I've been telling them all day long chase."
"17423180","17424360"," They're not listening to me, bro. "
"17426940","17428700"," I've been telling them all day long chase."
"17428940","17429680"," They don't listen to me."
"17432500","17433920"," They do the what abouts. "
"17444360","17445620"," So buy puts on it?"
"17445780","17446140"," Fuck no."
"17446720","17448200"," No, you don't buy puts on it."
"17452610","17454770"," But so we're at 2542. "
"17458350","17459590"," Well, let me go back to spy."
"17460170","17461550"," I don't know why this isn't updating."
"17498590","17502010"," Yeah, that that bread toil looks fucking nasty. "
"17502970","17503670"," Give it."
"17503790","17509550"," Give me a shout out and why don't you throw me a number of what you think price target is"
"17509550","17511850"," for for Brent oil."
"17512750","17522680"," I'm going to go with like the first bump on the road is probably 20 bucks. "
"17523540","17524240"," It'll start."
"17524440","17527580"," I think it'll start buying sport like 2285."
"17528700","17531380"," Rough road down to 20 and then maybe a plunge. "
"17533600","17542840"," Like a like a plunge at like four o'clock in the morning to like $18.81. That's what I"
"17542840","17543060"," think."
"17548780","17553360"," Man, Brent look at Brent bloodbath and Brent."
"17558950","17560410"," Just the street. "
"17568480","17573740"," Brent relies upon international markets more than American markets."
"17573740","17576820"," It's less prone to politics influencing its price."
"17579080","17582000"," Well, that's the that's the argument, at least. "
"17585600","17595160"," Oh, no, yes, it's less prone to to fluctuation in price based on because it's not based upon US"
"17595160","17595680"," politics."
"17596340","17597380"," That's the thesis."

"19683230","19689310"," there's two things that chase is making a very good point so there's two things to know yesterday"
"19689310","19699230"," the selling in spy specifically was uh real money selling and not options driven we talked about"
"19699230","19704010"," that yesterday remember when i said to you guys yesterday i was like this is not options driven and"
"19704010","19708750"," these levels or these this selling has nothing to do with like waterfall puts or anything you could"
"19708750","19715510"," tell that it was real money selling yesterday in spy um you could tell it wasn't options driven but"
"19715510","19721490"," if there are a bunch of put buyers that stepped into the market at all yesterday and let's say they"
"19721490","19729290"," expire like wednesday or friday or monday if they haven't been monetized at this point you would"
"19729290","19733650"," expect some kind of a vanarelli you might not get the charm side of it but you'll get you'll get"
"19733650","19743550"," the vanarelli we did see some longer dated positions added in the fix up"
"19743550","19748630"," a bit and the options flow generally don't speak of major fear protection now we know that too you"
"19748630","19758830"," could see that in um you could see that in the um tech right in tech stocks yesterday there's"
"19758830","19765090"," an argument for us going up to 430 in this too in other words we don't see the options america"
"19765090","19769190"," is currently inducing volatility i agree with that we think that if there was an options induced"
"19769190","19774270"," negative feedback with was that a loop or a look if we get more bounce or mean reversion after"
"19774270","19784190"," larger drawdowns instead futures just drop and stick a shown above yeah 40k and open interest"
"19784190","19794180"," on monday puts below 3,900 put wall support we think that volatility changes"
"19794180","19800760"," materially oh those shit uh i agree with that there's a there's a dark giant chasm down there chase"
"19800760","19808100"," if we break three 3,900 30 38 20 or something is coming really fast and hard and strong i"
"19808100","19813600"," agree with that statement too i think that volatility will change the chair this is because below 3 "
"19813600","19819780",",900 the positioning is put dominated as shown below in red okay concern here is that the weakness"
"19819780","19826400"," plays in the two factors we outlined two weeks ago large December put positions gain in size and"
"19826400","19831380"," due to fmc there is a catalyst to break the higher implied volatility yeah i agree with all that"
"19831380","19841200"," stuff uh no so t lt if t lt"
"19841200","19850960"," goes up you're going to see this the s&p 500 trade sideways yeah"
"19850960","19858240"," that so there's a it's not just December 30th there's there don't forget there's the jpm collar and"

"19868130","19875010"," do you remember if it's the 17th the can anybody go on twitter real quick and find out uh if"
"19875010","19878670"," the if the jpm collars i know they've got three collars they got one in jan or got one in"
"19878670","19893090"," december one in january i think in one in february or march 10 seconds"
"19895630","19899890"," so we're so people are still trapped in calls and they're gonna hold them hoping that we go up or"
"19899890","19909200"," not so they'll wait until monday probably yeah so chase troy is saying something that's important"
"19909200","19914100"," too he's saying eyeballing friday calls versus puts h strikes either side of the current price"
"19914100","19920200"," calls outweigh puts 1.5 to 1 that means we don't go up without a doubt they're not going to"
"19920200","19926240"," print those go well we can but we're unlikely to print them it would be more than likely to to"
"19926240","19931420"," trade sideways and slightly down into the weekend i would think unless some some like material"
"19931420","19941240"," options in the market change so the g so the jpm collar is december 30th that's interesting"
"19941240","19956110"," to know yes so"
"19956110","19960610"," there's some there's some argument to say that we could trade sideways and down burn all this shit"

"20084680","20089240"," still strong earlier in the day here they were hiding too it was really wild they just we put this"
"20089240","20093180"," up before it even happened i was like hey there's some sellers just hiding right here and then"
"20093180","20097980"," almost like yeah we can we can trade up here and then they just step right in like it was"
"20097980","20107860"," nothing um it's like i guess the fair would be the fair would be that um it doesn't matter"
"20107860","20117630"," when if we do it now or if we trade lower and then on monday we actually make this squeeze"
"20117630","20122590"," higher and then you blast straight down we have posted the u.s consumer credit ox over twenty"

"20153990","20159790"," you have to account for that uh so my my point i guess was if you took this long long"
"20159790","20165050"," like here you definitely have to have stops if you took it long today up here you definitely have"
"20165050","20174570"," to have stops and you'd have to know you'd have to know before it comes right so if we squeeze"

"20555080","20565000"," on down now you can search on it you guys so there's"
"20565000","20572580"," like two rules there's like two rules not rules but there's two um two things you always want to be"
"20572580","20577620"," you always want to be concerned about are you do your spreads overlap dividends and do your spreads"
"20577620","20588320"," close the cash you always want to ask that question and"
"20588320","20592060"," there's like you just go on you just if you're if you're ever like i want to buy apple calls"
"20592060","20598160"," or apple spreads always do a quick search every company even if you know that they do or don't just"
"20598160","20603180"," always do it it's like a rule especially if it's something not normal you don't normally trade"
"20603180","20611580"," always do research on dividends always do research on uh splits always do research on uh not spits"
"20611580","20619690"," not as a part but most most important is um does does does does the stock close to cash and"
"20619690","20625090"," uh and is is it dividends you can get they'll uh execute one side of your trade and you'll get"
"20625090","20629250"," phone call and they'll tell you you'll like fucking three hundred thousand dollars and you're and"
"20629250","20641790"," you'll get suicide overnight you"
"20641790","20647730"," don't hold spreads that long that's the point you closed before the dividend and you so there's"
"20647730","20652870"," like rules i we've got over them here so if you buy a spread right i remember we did the"
"20652870","20662310"," time horizon thing where i said to you so let's say you spend a hundred dollars right if you spend"
"20662310","20668150"," a hundred dollars on a spread right there's different time periods if you're if you're able to pick"
"20668150","20673890"," direction of the way you you want to be going the moment that i hit fifty percent profit i usually"
"20673890","20678890"," close them does that make sense i typically don't hold them two hundred percent now let's say you"
"20678890","20682510"," want to hold one percent because you think you're going to hit it before you ever hit the end of"
"20682510","20687790"," your holding your call your your call or debit spread or put spread or whatever um you can manage"
"20687790","20693750"," it by cutting legs off because if you come into the money on one side of it um some people"
"20693750","20698350"," will like take the money the side they made money on like let's say let's say um and especially"
"20698350","20702270"," when you hit hundred percent you want to close your spreads but people will manage their spreads"
"20702270","20706930"," too so let's say you're making all your money on one side of that spread right you take the money"
"20706930","20713410"," and you leave the cheap puts on as a free shot right does it make sense it's like a free"
"20713410","20719270"," uh like a free like lotto ticket for the could print or just expire worthless there's all kinds of"
"20719270","20724290"," different strategies anyways you can make more money in that time frame anyways if you buy like a"
"20724290","20730790"," three month spread does it make sense here along the way you're monetizing and managing that spread"
"20742820","20748100"," no no you just need to manage your position you need to be aware of how what what position you"
"20748100","20753260"," took how does it close to and you need to know if there's any dividends you don't want to have"
"20753260","20763070"," open spreads closing in on a dividend i've done that too"
"20763070","20767150"," i've taken the wrong side off before i've done all kinds of stupid shit i've made all kinds of"
