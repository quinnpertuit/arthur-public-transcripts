"270580","271240"," point as well."
"271600","277000"," And then this morning as well, you saw that we opened with no real, no real move into the market."
"277760","280920"," And there's an intent to want to unclench this market. "
"280920","282760"," So I was posting on Twitter."

"341430","350490"," the weekly and the monthly triggers and now they couldn't get it done in cash market so they have"
"350490","355510"," been trying to do it you can see back here they're tagging it during cash market not breaking"
"355510","364050"," through so they've been attempting to do it during after hours low liquidity environment stuff like"
"364050","372130"," that trying to smash through when I'm missing something here"
"372130","389420"," so get some technical stuff in the back again we just a second so"
"389420","395440"," you what would happen getting some texts in the background here uh so down here you can see they"

"402080","408800"," down here again now in cash market trying to break underneath uh this support now you can't get"
"408800","414540"," price loss a price velocity move to the downside unless we break through these levels of support"
"414540","420940"," here you can see them this is going all the way back now one two three uh on last Thursday"
"420940","426200"," they tried uh bears tried to sell it here right they tried to sell it again uh remember we spoke"

"432100","437060"," selling of the market they couldn't break through in cash market now they're trying to break"
"437060","444120"," through these support levels in low liquidity environments and I had posted I'd seen a Twitter post"
"444120","452080"," I believe back on the 17th uh from someone that posted about how we get you know price movement"
"452080","459540"," velocity to the downside and my my pause it was that anyone that has real money in this market not"
"459540","464920"," like you're spending your weekly paycheck on zero dates or something like that but you have real"
"464920","470680"," size in this market if you've made it to this point you've gone through two and a half years of"
"470680","478580"," market crash right there was a silent market crash back in late 2020 went through all through 2021"
"478580","488080"," in spec growth and it didn't actually reach into blue chips and until 2021 and then 2022 uh came"
"488080","495720"," out they came after the corporate debt bond uh tickers like apple and tesla and and finally the s&p"
"495720","502040"," 500 it basically had two two plus years of market crash so anyone with real money out there inside"
"502040","510500"," the market knows to either at this point uh to hedge or remove themselves from the market uh as a"
"510500","514140"," matter of fact myself I owned a bunch of tesla and I ended up selling it but when I was"
"514140","521320"," holding it hedging was dirt cheap it was it's it's stupid cheap right now and you've also seen seen"
"521320","526980"," the unwinding of shorts in the market going back from october through january there were some"
"526980","531680"," articles posted out there i'm not going to look for them for you but i think they lost 60 billion"
"531680","538660"," dollars unwinding shorts on this market and so when we're at this this top here with you saw tesla"
"538660","548560"," come up and almost trade 220 the first uh but i think everyone that's"
"548560","556120"," out there in this market you get you have to remember that 25 percent of this market is retail and"
"556120","562600"," then of the of the institutional investment investors some of the smaller large or smaller"
"562600","568780"," institutional investors they're smarter as well at this point uh so you've got a decent size"
"568780","575120"," portion of our stock market it's not the institutions it's not the long or short or short hedge"
"575120","582840"," funds but you've got a significant portion of market participants that have learned their lesson to"
"582840","590160"," some extent at this point this gets blamed on the zero date market to some extent but the truth but"
"590160","597000"," truth be told we haven't seen price velocity to the downside you've likely seen in most people that"
"597000","602480"," I know that have real size either in this market or come in and out of this market we're talking"
"602480","608980"," hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars no to hedge at this point i don't think anyone out"
"608980","613620"," there in their right mind has made it through this market without being well hedged and hedging was"
"613620","620920"," expensive until recently until we were up around that 220 right in that area there hedging was not"
"620920","627520"," cheap but it became very cheap during that unwind phase of the market and so there was absolutely"
"627520","632440"," no reason for you not to take profit or hedge cheaply as a matter of fact i'm on the phone"
"632440","638160"," this morning with two guys and we're looking at hedging on the market that's just printed it's been"
"638160","645980"," printing like gold and not in spy and not in the queues but in the Dow right so these estau"
"645980","654700"," these estau calls have been printing like insane amounts money whereas spy of course es sb 500 and"
"654700","660680"," the queues really aren't down uh you're not to see it's weird too because i'm looking at i'm"
"660680","667920"," looking at uh dixie this morning i was looking at dixie i was looking at hyg now they're trying to"

"678060","683260"," this morning to say to show you what algo mcago face is saying he's saying this is all bullshit in"
"683260","690160"," here this ain't going nowhere i guess to me you'd need more news than what they're trying to do to"
"690160","695600"," sell this market this looks more uh like bank real money selling this has nothing to do with any"
"695600","700700"," kind of news in the market uh let's try to tell you that we're you know crash mode or doom"
"700700","707660"," or anything like that there's like nothing about this that's um that's like a event driven of any"
"707660","713700"," kind this is literally a sell side market trying to get the market down as best they can at this"
"713700","724040"," moment and what's crazy is if you look at uh dixie i'll bring up dixie for you this morning and"
"724040","730020"," just talk about a disparity in dixie right here right dixie was up around here on the 28th at a"
"730020","736100"," dollar five and came all the way down here to on the on the first right this is a just"
"736100","742660"," on the 28 let's look at the 15 minute chart on dixie now let's just look at the roll over"
"742660","750100"," that took place on the 24th of february dixie's been coming down yet this isn't being shown in the"
"750100","756600"," market same thing with hyg as well if you look at hyg right now uh you know it's a tale"
"756600","764100"," of two different worlds right you're seeing hyg that was up from the 21st uh now it's rolled over"
"764100","773020"," today but not for that we know one two three four five six sessions hyg up and yet it wasn't"
"773020","779840"," showing itself inside of the s&p 500 right you have expected the s&p 500 to at least have"
"779840","785840"," traded higher for you know one two three four five and what's going on is you've got these shorts"
"785840","790260"," in the market you've got short solars in the market trying to get priced down you've got large"
"790260","795180"," banks trying to get priced down and especially into end of month we were talking about this"
"795180","802700"," yesterday and especially last thursday so i'm i'm captain's off the last thursday i'll tell you"
"802700","807560"," what what they say Wednesday or thursday so sometime in this time frame here i was talking to you"
"807560","814020"," about bulls need to get above or at that time need to get above four oh eight four ten and"
"814020","819300"," then it came down like four oh two or something yesterday four oh four bulls needed to get up there"
"819300","828580"," uh to to reset the weekly and monthly support levels and to watch the entire day yesterday the"
"828580","834280"," intent yesterday was that we want we needed to see what this price would close that we harped"
"834280","841260"," heavily on the price into the closing bell and then even from four p.m. to six p.m. to"
"841260","847160"," know what that price is do we close underneath those two levels and they literally slammed into it"
"847160","853620"," the last minute of the market it was 30 or 40 handles down in a one minute shot none of"
"853620","859200"," that is normal well it's it's normal on end of the month at times and they don't get to the"
"859200","865100"," numbers they want to get and usually the day after those days there's many instances on end of"
"865100","870940"," month where you'll finally see an unclenching for one to four days after the after the last day of"
"870940","876640"," that month so from the first to the fourth you'll either see the market head down for two or three"
"876640","882040"," days or we'll rip face off for a few days so that's what we're going to be looking for here"
"882040","887760"," in the coming two to three days for the beginning of march what's fascinating about this though too"
"887760","895020"," is that march and april traditionally are one of the two of the best months to be buying a bottom"
"895020","902840"," for a great rally now you guys i think it's but it's you probably heard this uh add or you've"
"902840","907980"," been hearing this everybody about how it's selling may go away everybody knows that march you buy"
"907980","914160"," the dip and you trade that up into april it's one of the best couple month periods of the year"
"914160","919000"," that you're looking for a dip and not seeing price velocity to the downside at this point in the"
"919000","925560"," market has to be frustrating it has to be frustrating for um for south side inside the market has"
"925560","930560"," to be frustrating for the jpm collar people that are out there that want to see three thousand and"
"930560","935680"," that kind of stuff now i'm going to bring something up for you that's fascinating here uh i want to"
"935680","941800"," show you this this this monthly support level that they're trying to break right now right right"
"941800","946760"," over here want to show you some kind of fascinating here and this is where this is where my"
"946760","954480"," question lies for not just i told people on thursday that i wanted to see what the end of the"
"954480","961120"," month would bring what would the end of the month bring and why why are they trying to get"
"961120","967480"," underneath and break the support level it's because they can't reset this weekly and this monthly"
"967480","973460"," they can't reset this weekly and monthly support level if we break underneath it on the close the"
"973460","980280"," month of february and it's kind of important to know this because what this leaves us with for this"
"980280","989240"," month is no real support in the market technically speaking this market has no real support here"
"989240","994640"," for and into next end to end of quarter uh into into the into the rest of march at least"
"995100","1001640"," which is a very dangerous situation uh i'm i've heard people someone said on twitter a week ago"
"1002160","1007180"," they said oh no you can wake up tomorrow and we'll have a market crash you can't say that and"
"1007180","1013360"," i'm like no that's not true you think so now but that actually doesn't happen there are support"
"1013360","1019760"," levels within the market that we should stop and have checkpoints that which we always have and"
"1019760","1024160"," since the beginning of the stock market uh you can go back and look and see even when we're in"
"1024160","1030500"," a market crash situation that there are specific places uh the market will stop at even if it"
"1030500","1037619"," crashes uh flash crash of some kind and this person was actually wrong uh and i didn't want to"
"1037619","1041359"," comment on it in twitter i was like i'm just gonna keep him out of that because he probably doesn't"
"1041359","1047319"," know what he's talking about we can actually show this stuff in every market crash going back to"
"1047319","1053940"," the beginning of of the stock market that there are places uh natural natural signposts natural"
"1053940","1060060"," support levels uh that will get broken one at a time as we break through levels right we stop there"
"1060060","1067200"," we trade higher reject again come back down on our way down and what's fascinating is what the fact"
"1067200","1075780"," that we closed yesterday below uh the weekly and monthly the weekly and monthly uh support levels"
"1075780","1080140"," we didn't reset those levels for the month of march and i'll be honest with you we're probably"
"1080140","1086160"," gonna trade sideways right now we're not gonna crash or anything but it opens the door and this is"
"1086160","1090480"," the key that i was trying to make to you and on that cap and zalfa and that big long"
"1090480","1097320"," post i made uh was that you want to see if this support resets itself or not and when it"
"1097320","1105180"," doesn't reset itself there are problems there are functional uh or technical problems in the market"
"1105180","1111700"," at this point so for the rest of the month into at least the end of quarter at any point"
"1111700","1118640"," if they want to sell this market there is no natural spot people will point out the 200 day weekly"
"1118640","1124100"," moving average as a natural spot i'll give you that one that one's probably the next level down"
"1124100","1130980"," from here and but below that you want to know where the next real level is it's now like 3 "
"1130980","1136380",",300 and i'm going to show it to you uh so this person that was on twitter that said there"
"1136380","1142060"," uh you can just keep crashing that is not true but what he what i didn't say to him was"
"1142060","1146820"," when we break through the weekly and the monthly i'm going to bring this up for you real quick give"
"1146820","1153080"," me just a second when we break through this level that we this level that we are breaking to this"
"1153080","1162120"," monthly here this emotional level that the next the next level down is far far away i want to show"
"1162120","1167460"," you this level right now that we're breaking through and uh where that where that actual level is"
"1167460","1174700"," on the market it is far down so if you are hedged in this market you you can't stop being"
"1174700","1179960"," hedged in this market if you're like i'm going to buy some calls up here that kind of stuff we're"
"1179960","1184840"," going to talk about a second case here for we're going to talk about a second case we'll bring it"
"1184840","1194540"," right here for you give me just a second i want to show you this"
"1194540","1200220"," down below here now now that we've broken through i want you to see this break here of the weekly"
"1200220","1207780"," and monthly and the importance of this this is a critical thing for you to to be aware of is"
"1207780","1215200"," that uh like when you have support and resistance levels when you're creating a support level right"
"1215200","1220500"," you're trading up to a new support level or resistance level you're breaking through it here then"
"1220500","1226040"," retesting it retesting it for a move higher when we're coming down and breaking through support"
"1226040","1234120"," levels we're trying to break through sell into those buyers weaken those buyers right so that that"
"1234120","1239900"," support level is now kind of weak right you know that you've worn out some of the buying the demand"
"1239900","1245980"," to buy there and that if you if you go go too much with selling but you can slip right"
"1245980","1250920"," through those levels right we all know this it's standard uh to know that kind of stuff now i'm not"
"1250920","1257040"," showing you the 200 a weekly moving average i'll put that up here at some point but the real key"
"1257040","1265700"," point here is that we're now back to uh this next level down below here it's very low it's down"
"1265700","1273660"," currently it sits at 330 40 on the spy so when you hear people like mike wilson tell you you"
"1273660","1283640"," hear some uh bank people tell you uh hey we can make an leg blower in the"
"1283640","1291760"," first market has broken through that natural point uh over stop right when we stop in the market"
"1291760","1296820"," and we say okay we're gonna take a break here you hear people this is this goes back to people"
"1296820","1300960"," on twitter they're like uh they're like no no no we can go through all that stuff i'm like that's"
"1300960","1305440"," not true historically it's not true i'm going to show you i'm going to show you right now why it's"
"1305440","1312140"," not true so you can actually see this kind of stuff and when if this does happen how infrequently"
"1312140","1318960"," it happens now so we're just going to spy as an example right now and lo and behold what do"
"1318960","1324140"," you see here this is going back to 2020 you see how we came down and slammed right into this"
"1324140","1331120"," uh this white level right you can see this white level here this is your three month level down"
"1331120","1337060"," below we slammed right into it and it held uh you can actually see that we almost slammed into the"
"1337060","1344020"," first crash that we had during 2020 and you can see we held this level here uh this is back"
"1344020","1350060"," in 2019 i'm actually going to switch over to spx so we can go farther back in history with this"
"1350060","1357820"," uh so you guys can see this and get off the spy and the fascinating party watched that same white"
"1357820","1362920"," line right there right and i could bring you up the three the six month in the one year and"
"1362920","1368540"," show you where these levels are down below because they match up almost perfectly down here uh this"
"1368540","1373160"," is where the danger zone lies for the market right this is where the collapsed bears are soft"
"1373160","1377300"," spears are trying to tell you that not only you're going to slam into three thousand uh you're"
"1377300","1382920"," going to go underneath that that's that 2100 level right there probably that's probably your six"
"1382920","1388400"," month uh trend as well you can kind of see how fascinating it is that we slammed down into it"
"1388400","1393540"," right and then we bleed right over it these these last two really bad crashes that we had here's"
"1393540","1397340"," another one with a three month that caught back up we slammed underneath it i'm not going to bring"
"1397340","1403320"," up the six and twelve month uh triggers but i'll show them i'll try to post them on on fin"
"1403320","1408320"," to it at that point at this point and i just want you to be aware uh that now that"
"1408320","1415200"," we've closed the month of february now that we've closed the month of february out with with this"
"1415200","1422140"," with with the damage that's been done down here that there is some risk here there is some risk and"
"1422140","1427740"," i want to show you on a closer level what i'm what i'm talking about this risk here uh and"
"1427740","1432720"," and why it's so significant let me tell you they can delete some of this stuff here all these"
"1432720","1439820"," drawings here remove 15 drawings and the key point here is what mike wilson is talking about what"
"1439820","1445340"," this the sell side in the market is talking about is you see this yellow line right here this is"
"1445340","1452040"," the daily uh trigger and it's starting to roll over the market right here and we also have the"
"1452040","1457740"," hourly the five minute the one minute's not shown here but there is a one minute here and we're"
"1457740","1464820"," starting to try to try to hang out underneath try to get underneath uh with all of these triggers"
"1464820","1469500"," rolling over in the market the only thing that we're not seeing at this point is i'm not seeing"
"1470120","1473720"," there's only one other thing that we're not seeing right now i'm not seeing the weekly and monthly"
"1473720","1482260"," um uh sell side before price heading lower they're both holding up so far quite well but this is"
"1482260","1488180"," something to be concerned about if you are in this market long and you see us trade below this"
"1488180","1493780"," weekly moving average and we hold underneath this weekly and monthly moving average there's not"
"1493780","1498800"," there's not that much support in the market here if they want to sell this market quick and fast"
"1498800","1503660"," there's there's outside of the weekly moving average there isn't much holding this market up that"
"1503660","1507880"," would be to me a song that would be like a speed bump to me the weekly moving average at"
"1507880","1513440"," this point uh be the first target below uh but then you but then the real the real support lies"
"1513440","1519200"," down at 3,300 and we know we already know that to expect this sometime this year i just want"
"1519200","1523220"," you to know heading into the end of this quarter uh that that door is wide open to get down"
"1523220","1529760"," there and we already tested the weekly moving average i want to say uh last summer at some point we"
"1529760","1536060"," went down there and tested it once before so even that level is suspect at this point um and so"
"1536060","1541180"," that there's your target right down here at 3,300 and it's the door is wide open uh the only"
"1541180","1546020"," way for that door to close is for a repair to be done in the month of march do i"
"1546020","1549980"," think we get the velocity to get down there probably not at this point i'm not seeing it in the"
"1549980","1554380"," weekly i'm not seeing it in the monthly velocity and then we're going to get down there usually"
"1554380","1560820"," we'll see it uh develop over the course of a few weeks one two three weeks to actually get that"
"1560820","1567480"," nasty move down we are we do historically have a great march a viable bottom in march for march"
"1567480","1573920"," enabled to take a long in the market we're not seeing price velocity at this point on the downside"
"1573920","1579220"," and to be honest if i was a bear what i'd be looking for in the market is for that"
"1579220","1585480"," trade higher if i had a if i if i was a bear what i would be looking for is"
"1585480","1591660"," hedging to come off the market i'd be looking for a trade believe it or not like 420 or 430"
"1591660","1598480"," that takes tesla up and above and it allows bulls to feel like they're in safety and they pull"
"1598480","1603080"," hedging off the market and go long this market and that's when they wrote that's when they actually"
"1603080","1607520"," dumped this market down uh so for the next few weeks if you want to know what i think is"
"1607520","1611380"," going to happen i'm going to show you a uh i'm going to show you a bot that we have"
"1611380","1616920"," we had called algo mc algo face we talk about him sometimes i'm going to put him up real quick"
"1616920","1622320"," and say what i think is going to happen for the next few for the next few weeks here and"
"1622320","1627380"," then what i expect to happen uh that we we try to trade this up and i'll show i'm going"
"1627380","1633380"," to show it to you right now bring him up and algo mc algo face hold on a second here"
"1642760","1648040"," okay so algo mc algo face right here right uh he looks like he's going to come back up trade"
"1648040","1652820"," this down right come back up and we're going to sell this high and get a low inside of the"
"1652820","1659380"," market at some point 392 52 possibly somewhere in there maybe slightly higher now you might retest"
"1659380","1663860"," these lows here come back up and can't we will fail to get a new high and then we're going"
"1663860","1669820"," to actually trade higher into this 418 or 420 this is kind of where i'm looking this is over here"
"1669820","1676840"," this is march 29th right here and this is april 13th so we're looking still for a dip to buy"
"1676840","1684160"," into a dip to buy believe it or not in this market somewhere where we are currently right now and"
"1684160","1689560"," have that dip that that dip buy to buy for the month of march in april now with that said"
"1689560","1695900"," uh you have to hedge my thought process here man is that we trade that we trade that this is"
"1695900","1701140"," kind of near bottom you're going to look back in march and say i thought we'd be much lower here"
"1701140","1706560"," i think the market's two heads personally to get much lower but what they have broken that level so"
"1706560","1710700"," my point here is that if we're down here and you can find a dip to buy for the month"
"1710700","1718140"," of march or april if it's here 390 392 398 and then we try to trade this up to 420"
"1718140","1723660"," or 430 and then i think that's when it can happen i think that that's when they can roll this"
"1723660","1729440"," market over you'll see some dehedging coming into the market believe it or not i think that bulls"
"1729440","1733580"," are going to think that they're out of the woods and that's when there's a good chance for the"
"1733580","1738540"," market to roll over nice and heavy and hard if it's going to if it's going to happen end of"
"1738540","1744640"," first quarter or summertime anything like that i think that it's on i think it's above and not here"
"1744640","1748840"," if it is here if it if we do roll the market over here and get out of 3,300"
"1748840","1753480"," i don't think that anyone's going to get hurt here i think i don't think that any bulls are at"
"1753480","1759820"," least the bulls that i know are all either if they're long they're super hedged and i think they"
"1759820","1764140"," need to be convinced that they're in the safe and that they're in safety now at this point i think"
"1764140","1771300"," without that there's nothing that can be done to uh shake them out of the market at this point i"
"1771300","1775740"," think the i think the only way that you shake bulls out of this market at this point is if"
"1775740","1781540"," is if you if they believe that that we're going higher and i don't think they'll i don't think"
"1781540","1787040"," they're going to believe that until um i don't think they're going to believe that until they're"
"1787040","1792780"," trading a but like tesla specifically right uh you know i'll show it to you here in tesla how it"
"1792780","1800180"," happens i'll show you exactly what happens with tesla let me just a second here and this and this"
"1800180","1806240"," is how it happens with tesla if you want to trick uh or d hedge or anything like that let"
"1806240","1829720"," me bring up uh how it's been done at least with tesla in the past let me"
"1829720","1849710"," just a second here so"
"1849710","1857410"," this is tesla right here right and you'll see up here that you you have to like get a tesla"
"1857410","1864930"," bull has to be tricked into de hedging and so we'll trade high enough to actually throw it down let"
"1864930","1872510"," me just make this uh you'll see us trade higher than this daily right we'll get above it here if"
"1872510","1878070"," they finally send it down and we're not quite there right yet right we're not quite there this is a"
"1878070","1884090"," prime example tesla's like a prime prime example uh you see this big blue line right here right"
"1884090","1890430"," it's this big blue line coming in right now in tesla i don't see i want to see let's just"
"1890430","1897730"," put this somewhere else here i want to see tesla bulls i'm a i'm a tesla bull by the way"
"1897730","1902490"," if you don't know that uh but this is the note this is the no trade zone right for tesla"
"1902490","1908530"," you bought the dip on tesla down here you're hedging up here and you're looking for a long above"
"1908530","1915730"," this blue line right here and this currently sits at 223.08 so my my point here would be uh"
"1915730","1922770"," that you would get price above right get price above this blue line right here bulls would feel"
"1922770","1928110"," safe and they'd say hey look they'd say look at that we just beat the uh the south side of"
"1928110","1932810"," this market we just beat all these hedge funds we just beat these banks whoo-hoo next leg up"
"1932810","1938150"," confirmed you'd see it all over fin to it you'd see it all over the news probably see like barons"
"1938150","1943610"," telling you we're in a new bull market bull run down here bull market up here right we would"
"1943610","1947630"," consolidate here for a for a week or two or something like that and they'd be talking about"
"1947630","1953170"," retesting uh all-time highs on the spy and that kind of stuff and you this is where it would"
"1953170","1957730"," happen where you'd get that crash down to 3,300 in the market this is my take on what i"
"1957730","1963770"," think how i think it happens because currently where we are right now uh it's not showing that"
"1963770","1968330"," currently right now you're seeing tesla supported even though you don't even though you don't think"
"1968330","1973250"," it is you think we're going to have a market crash today it's not happening i promise you and you"
"1973250","1978090"," can see it right here it's showing itself right here well it's actually it's actually curling up"
"1978090","1983330"," you can actually see this starting to start to mellow out a little bit and usually price should"
"1983330","1988430"," come up here uh and you'd actually want to catch these guys in here and sell back down here and"
"1988430","1994410"," here's april and may right here okay so you can see april and may down below you really want to"
"1994410","1999850"," see that price get up there and you really want to see bull's bill safety right now they don't feel"
"1999850","2005830"," safety but they haven't felt it for three weeks uh i want to say that mid- or mid-february"
"2005830","2012810"," early-february bulls are clenched clenched as hard as they can and uh they're not letting loose uh"
"2012810","2017130"," speaking i don't know what you do uh if you're just trading deserinates you're just a day trader it"
"2017130","2021410"," means nothing but if you go out there and find a real investor with real money in the market"
"2021410","2029090"," they're they're heads to the tips right now 100% uh they're not just like they're in there not in"
"2029090","2036130"," that that woo phase of the market right now they did that at 100 when tesla hit 100 people were"
"2036130","2042910"," jumping out to buy they're buying 100 bucks they're buying 120 they're buying 130 bucks that's when"
"2042910","2049170"," they were jumping in the market so i don't know what to say at this point for how deep the"
"2049170","2056110"," market can go down as a matter of fact you've got uh 188 on tap for tesla is a low"
"2056110","2063630"," expected low if we unclench here let's say let's say tesla trades down to 188 i'd love to buy that"
"2063630","2069790"," by that trade right there and take that up to 220 or even higher at that point i don't i'm"
"2069790","2072710"," not seeing the mark crash today i guess it's"
"2074730","2084590"," my point we're looking for a place to"
"2084590","2094370"," resell uh spy i'll show you where that is trying to tee off right now in the"
"2094370","2099410"," early they try to do it this morning off the open trying to they try to tee off right here"
"2099410","2107570"," on 395 and the target above is 399 68 just like we did two days ago on the high side"
"2107570","2114090"," right here right here so now 399 88 above they're going to try to keep smashing it down smashing it"
"2114090","2120870"," down smashing it down this should end with the next three days from today into the fourth if we"
"2120870","2125810"," continue to go down at all that this should end within the next four days if you're a bull out"
"2125810","2130730"," there and it's like that typically it takes one to three days and we could actually start squeezing"
"2130730","2136330"," air straight to the moon for three days we could go up six percent the next three days right i"
"2136330","2140810"," know you guys are looking right here and thinking this is doom and gloom uh but i know south side"
"2140810","2147310"," is expecting that six percent right now south side is like we're going down six percent over the"
"2147310","2153370"," next three days uh but that that might not happen we could actually go up six percent uh well"
"2153370","2160130"," probably not six but uh usually at end of month uh we we're either down like six percent over three"
"2160130","2171300"," or four days or up six percent over three days i kid you not they're"
"2171300","2185950"," bringing this up for you here ready"
"2185950","2194700"," to put the squawk back on and we'll go over the economic calendar real quick now we've used some of"
"2194700","2204690"," this stuff this guy was saying a few minutes ago feds kashkari this morning said we are not in"
"2204690","2210910"," a recession and in the same sentence this morning said uh i'm not sure if we'll be able to achieve"
"2210910","2218950"," a soft landing uh i agree with his statement uh or i i don't i disagree with the we're not"
"2218950","2222930"," in a recession statements but i don't think we get well i think we get a soft landing in terms"
"2222930","2229090"," of price uh so i don't know what their idea of price for the soft landing is i think the"
"2229090","2235430"," i think the idea of a not a soft landing would be the s&p 500 at uh 2,400,"
"2236230","2245490"," 1,600, something like that uh so so i don't know what his what what he means by if if"
"2245490","2252290"," kashkari thinks he is meaning uh lower than 2,800 i guess would be the uh the point on the"
"2252290","2258270"," point on that remember you have your target above 399 i'll just give you that i'll get i'll i'll"
"2258270","2265530"," draw a box up there for you one more time so you can see it right up in here it's"
"2265530","2285040"," uh 399 30 right"
"2285040","2295000"," up in here we'll see if the white white light will ross the red light and"
"2295000","2300060"," stop here to go off the wall because the wall colors are sitting up in here now there are sellers"
"2300060","2304940"," right here as well with their weaker sellers than the five-minute sellers that are above these are"
"2304940","2309840"," the one-minute sellers here let me get back here for you these are the one-minute sellers right"
"2309840","2320970"," here and these are the five-minute sellers above up here uh"
"2320970","2325510"," kashkari is also kashkari is also saying that there are some grounds to be optimistic but inflation"
"2325510","2331890"," must be cooled we'll take a look at though uh the inverted yield curve today unemployment i'll"
"2331890","2338450"," bring those up for you unemployment uh the fed funds rate the yield curve inversion i'll bring all"
"2338450","2344830"," that shit up for you uh and then inflation and all other stuff us house uh representatives"
"2344830","2351430"," committee approves bill giving biden authority to ban tiktok that should be good for some of the"
"2351430","2357350"," other uh social media stocks or social social media stocks that are out there fed's bostick i"
"2357350","2363610"," continue to believe that the us central banks policy rate should be raised to five to five point"
"2363610","2371330"," five two percent range uh the policy rate will have to stay at that level well into 2024 uh that's"
"2371330","2380890"," unexpected i'm not i don't i don't know if i well in 2024"
"2380890","2390250"," uh that's a shocker to me uh man this is reminding me of the 1970s so"
"2390250","2399910"," much uh i'm fascinated to see the interplay in the presidential election uh and how much this"
"2399910","2405650"," policy will change uh this this is going to be fascinating because we're living in a time of"
"2405650","2413990"," extreme greed unlike other periods in u.s history uh and we know what happened uh when reagan was"
"2413990","2421870"," elected and what his promises were uh so you would probably expect someone to run for uh president"
"2421870","2429190"," that will promise the world um i don't know i mean the way this country is right now not the"
"2429190","2435010"," politics side of the wall street hat politics side uh i doubt that takes place i doubt that that"
"2435010","2441430"," that happens in the 2020 possibly maybe that is the case but uh i don't know i'm fine that one"
"2441430","2446690"," hard to believe bostick saying you'll need to see monetary policy have greater dampening effect on"
"2446690","2453730"," demand slower wage growth before concluding inflation is moving steadily lower fed's bostick is"
"2453730","2459890"," saying the economy has enough momentum to withstand higher interest rates without a major downturn"
"2459890","2466010"," uh yeah i think i agree with that to some extent uh i think i agree with that i i"
"2466010","2471370"," think what i'm afraid of if they're saying that rates aren't going to be cut until 2024 or later"
"2471990","2478310"," dude you're we'll go back today and look at those years where we had a policy like this where"
"2478310","2485810"," they're using rates instead of uh mmt and we grind sideways end up for many years so we'll go back"
"2485810","2491370"," and look at that you know because you want to front run that uh maybe they're just saying that so"
"2491370","2499410"," that uh they can front run uh rate pausing or cuts at some point themselves so that we can't time"
"2499410","2504910"," it or something maybe they're throwing out shit on the wall or something like that uh we'll talk"
"2504910","2510930"," about that too because i'll show you instances where they front run pausing or cutting of uh"
"2510930","2517090"," federal or fed funds rate and that's when we get our actual dump usually there's just kind of two"
"2517090","2524350"," ways to find just two surefire ways to to look for that last leg down uh and what i'm looking"
"2524350","2532930"," for specifically is probably a two to three month lead out uh sometimes it sometimes it said you"
"2532930","2538630"," don't get the two or three months sometimes it is when they pause uh or cut rates uh if they"
"2538630","2543830"," can't if they don't anticipate it they'll start to roll the market down then it's usually also when"
"2543830","2551170"," unemployment is beginning to make its way higher it's the the only two consistent ways uh to know"
"2551170","2558270"," when that last leg is coming believe it or not the two-year yield does not show it we've have"
"2558270","2564790"," many many instances or enough instances in the past to make it an inaccurate indicator for when the"
"2564790","2570830"," market actually makes its role it's it's like accurate like 60 percent of the time which is not"
"2570830","2578150"," accurate enough as a matter of fact when it's inaccurate is when they're still raising rates and"
"2578150","2584990"," when unemployment hasn't turned up now so we're looking for those two specific things for that last"
"2584990","2591110"," leg down we're looking for the front running of a pause in rates or cutting of rates and we're"
"2591110","2596890"," looking for unemployment to turn up in in the economy now for that real last nasty leg down that"

"8586550","8595050"," get double bottomed at 198 93 but basically 197 It's trying to trade up right now to 204 39 Uh,"

"8635860","8637080"," be a natural selling point."
"8637300","8641140"," So you're going to see panicky bulls selling as well So it's probably lower than 220. "
"8641720","8647980"," I think I said 217 And then and then they've found it 216 or something briefly and we went back"

"8703220","8706940"," Well, it was in 2022 and not Not the same year."
"8707300","8707860"," I go. "

"9169030","9174150"," It's just not there if anything happens And we start blasting down there's nothing stopping that"
"9174150","9182010"," train Uh least for the month of march Uh That support has deteriorated and eroded and been"
"9182010","9187770"," destroyed Um and you've got like revenge selling sell side in this market trying to get this market"
"9187770","9188110"," down."
"9188210","9188950"," Does that mean it breaks?"
"9189610","9192210"," No, not at all Doesn't mean it breaks."
"9192430","9196830"," It just means that they have done some Think of yourself is like walking down the street in full"

"9211750","9221190"," with that said um Uh with that said it doesn't mean we can't trade sideways or trade up in sideways"
"9221950","9230570"," For the month of march either and algo mccago face has us trading sideways and up Uh for the month"
"9230570","9235470"," of march in into april Uh failure to make a new high as well in there. "
"9235510","9237710"," So, um, it's something like this."
"9237910","9243350"," I'll show it to you Uh somewhere in here some kind of failure to make a new high up in"
"9243350","9250850"," here Yeah, that's what he's got us doing like a A failure right here come back down Catch this"
"9250850","9254210"," support here and then catching 430 or 420 or 430."
"9254430","9258170"," I'll take a look at it This is the wrong time scale for you though. "
"9258590","9261090"," This is march and april believe it or not."

"9284300","9284820"," I have to do it."
"9284840","9291720"," So Alago mccago face is saying this is bottom Now even though he's saying this is bottom."
"9292100","9295380"," I want you to know that that this is all bullshit now. "
"9295380","9301980"," Okay For at least the next month Oh, I would not I'm not trusting this down here at all So"

"9311740","9316940"," I'm gonna be like, oh shit Because we're probably gonna blast Maybe rip."
"9317140","9322500"," Well, maybe squeeze and then blast down to the depths of hell, but um Basically, but algo mccago"
"9322500","9327140"," face is saying Uh that now we'll have a failure somewhere above. "
"9327420","9332480"," I think it's 406 or 410 I'll come back down into end of month."
"9332960","9339220"," This would do your um, this would do your Your bullshit for jpm, and then you have that swing high"
"9339220","9344760"," in april Uh and grab 420 or 430 up in here somewhere up in there."
"9344820","9348860"," It's what it's looking like something like that Um, I'll try to get it. "
"9349000","9349980"," I'll try to chart."
"9350240","9351260"," I know how about this."
"9351400","9361740"," I'll just chart it for you and um So you can see the actual prices um Of"
"9361740","9371500"," what what he's saying Now you can't trust"
"9371500","9375800"," him that much This is the other thing about I have to write a bunch of stuff about like I"
"9375800","9382440"," have to do a paper on algo mccago face because algo mccago face He's only as good as he's only"
"9382440","9389940"," as good as the market acts So if the market does something that algo mccago face doesn't uh account"
"9389940","9395120"," for he'll change his mind He'll be like yeah, you know what we're going over here now Uh, so it's"
"9395120","9401380"," only as good as it's only algo mccago face is only as good as a few days ahead week ahead"
"9402200","9403360"," Uh in his predictions. "
"9404020","9406380"," So there's are some problems with algo mccago face."
"9406580","9412940"," I'm gonna be honest with you Uh, so you know, it's like it's like I would I would use algo"
"9412940","9418860"," mccago face as a Uh, this is what I think we're going unless something changes materially that I"
"9418860","9427520"," haven't seen That's how I would take algo mccago face You know, it's good for the next few days"
"9427520","9433780"," good for planning And if not this then that right if we don't do what algo mccago face is doing"
"9433780","9439580"," we have to be concerned You know, you can do a snap of this you guys want to do a"
"9439580","9448960"," snap of this maybe Um, you want to take a snap of this you can do a snip Now there"
"9448960","9460820"," it is right there And you would see this um you would this is the Is"
"9460820","9470680"," that uh, 27 EMA on the daily chart something like that right there Does that make sense take a"
"9470680","9471120"," snip of that."
"9472400","9481000"," Um, you see how low we are right here, right Um, you're talking about a squeeze higher a failure"
"9481800","9487880"," That's that that's that shit you guys are watching out there that bull flag See the uh, you see the"
"9487880","9496840"," the failure to break above right here That's at 410 412 or something Uh, then we come back down"
"9496840","9506800"," again This is um That's march 13th right there a"
"9506800","9516700"," low on the 13th that could be the 17th Uh Uh Now it's claiming on"
"9516700","9517640"," march 30th. "
"9518060","9524040"," We're up at 414 I doubt that I don't I don't think that this algo does well down the road"
"9524860","9529900"," Uh, I really am looking for a pin below 4060 on the 31st."
"9530040","9532440"," I am still so I don't trust mr."
"9532640","9538660"," mccago face this far out in time But anyways, uh, that's that's what he's thinking is going to"
"9538660","9547400"," happen Now this is definitely not financial advice Uh, I use this for I use this for like a day"
"9547400","9556920"," out 15 minutes out five minutes out Uh for a for a general gist as to where we're going Right"
"9556920","9562160"," by the bottom by the bottom by the bottom that kind of stuff This can materially change in an"
"9562160","9562460"," instant."
"9562460","9567000"," So do not Do not do like you look at mr."
"9567140","9575840"," mccago face and you're like Now trust your ass Yeah, it's not a rule or even a guideline. "
"9576360","9583420"," It's only it really is only good for like You know, you know you like think about yourself when"
"9583420","9586560"," you're like I think we're going here in the next month or two And then some of the materially"
"9586560","9592560"," changes and you're like, oh fuck that i'm bearish Uh, I would I would assign that same thing to an"
"9592560","9605140"," algorithm You can kind of see what he's thinking there Yeah"
"9606320","9607840"," Yeah, this is bullish believe it or not."
"9608220","9610080"," No, what's happening right now is very bullish."
"9610320","9615620"," The longer we spend here Uh, the more bullish we have we just need to keep price above this white"
"9615620","9620520"," line right here If it starts the turn you guys want to know what what looks bearish. "
"9620600","9621880"," We're saying what bearish is here."
"9621980","9627840"," I'll show it to you If you're if you're bearish, I'll tell you what to be looking for Uh, I'm"
"9627840","9629860"," not telling you that this is financial advice or anything."
"9630060","9637220"," I'm telling you what you're looking for You're looking for that right there And you're looking for"
"9637220","9643980"," this right here You want you what we're watching these two lines if they're curling over or they"
"9643980","9645680"," curl Are they curling up are they curling over?"
"9645980","9646800"," That's a big question. "
"9646840","9647940"," Are they curling up or curling over?"
"9649180","9656320"," Uh, if you see price Begin to trade out of here That's bearish is all fuck right there That's"
"9656320","9663680"," bearish That's pretty fucking bearish and you're looking for these lines to go under there too So"
"9663680","9667040"," I'm not seeing the bearishness yet personally Maybe you are."
"9667160","9667940"," I'm not seeing it yet."
"9667940","9668540"," So far. "
"9668740","9674860"," I'm seeing the white line curl up seeing the red line curl up Seeing price above and holding the"
"9674860","9675240"," white line."
"9675580","9682020"," So for me at least to check it off check marks here Now if I want to start getting bearish"
"9682020","9682840"," here, what am I looking for?"
"9682940","9686340"," I just showed you right Want to see price get underneath this red line."
"9686520","9691500"," I want to see the white line dip down underneath the red line I'm looking for signs that we're"
"9691500","9698000"," going to roll the market over here And so I see that so I see those signs Um, we're just"
"9698000","9752730"," consolidating at this point Did"
"9752730","9753770"," berry tweet today?"
"9753990","9759470"," I hadn't been on I saw I went on to uh fin twit Twice the last two days and I"
"9759470","9768470"," couldn't get on Uh like I could get on but I couldn't read anybody's tweets Uh like I'm like I"
"9768470","9769850"," post the tweet, but that's it. "
"9769870","9776810"," I couldn't I couldn't read anybody else's tweets For some weird reason like any like any like the"
"9776810","9804280"," follower one you follow like the tooth when you can choose each one So"
"9804280","9812060"," he even now go magago face the same we're going up hit a 405 by the way Mr. Magago face"
"9812060","9826660"," the saying we're going up there Uh"
"9826660","9837200"," be a little careful here So we've got a 395 p's there's 318 000 of them There"
"9837200","9844140"," were 42 cents Keep your eyes on that options chain if they get down to like five cents or something"
"9844140","9854040"," sometimes the run will be over They're able to torch those puts They're at"
"9854040","9863580"," 395 Typically they don't want to close in the money puts or calls sometimes they do but that's not"
"9863580","9868380"," often that they'll try to close puts or calls So at least on the put side they want to they"
"9868380","9882820"," want to like an anti anti magnet to 395 Or below Uh,"
"9882820","9884620"," I want you to think about this out there."
"9884680","9891940"," So someone said I don't trust this uptick in the chat Um So think about this sometimes we do but"
"9891940","9898080"," like the laws of probability We won't close a large set of calls in the money."
"9898080","9903800"," Sometimes we do but not often it's not every time right Uh right now we have a very large uh"
"9903800","9913700"," number of puts zero dates on uh 395 p so It'll act like a detractor So they'll"
"9913700","9924080"," try to close the market above 395 like 396 And right now we're trading 395 93 So"
"9924080","9931400"," they'll attempt to they don't always we have seen days here where we've seen hundreds Hundreds of"
"9931400","9939140"," thousands of puts and calls, but it's just a rare it's rare that it happens It's like one out of"
"9939140","9946280"," every 10 Not Not that many it states that rare for every day of the week you might or every"
"9946280","9953280"," 10 sessions you might see one session where it happens I'm not talking about other Put their calls"
"9953280","9958240"," that were taken out or put on the market a month before or three months before I'm talking about"
"9958240","9975700"," zero dates Coming into the market that day You don't often see it Yeah,"
"9975960","9976560"," it's something like this. "
"9976720","9977700"," Let me explain it better to you."
"9977940","9983240"," So let me do the let me explain like the algorithmic agal face is like It's predicting many bars"
"9983240","9991240"," out And so it predicted the the goodness of the prediction is like one to three days out Uh three"
"9991240","9993640"," bars out five bars out does that make sense?"
"9994040","9998720"," So you might your eyes are seeing Uh 50 bars out right now."
"9998720","10003780"," I think I've got it set to 60 bars out Uh, but it's only really good for so if we're"
"10003780","10011400"," in a day chart, it's only good for three bars That makes sense Now when I only when I set"
"10011400","10018160"," it to three bars, it doesn't show the line because Uh, the predictive path of it is the predictive"
"10018160","10021640"," path is before Does it make sense to you guys?"
"10021840","10023080"," So, um here. "
"10023200","10026360"," I'm explaining In a better way."
"10026580","10031560"," So If it's tracking this right here, right?"
"10032100","10042610"," This is it's tracking Uh, it's tracking what has happened And"
"10042610","10052120"," then it begins a prediction Right here against"
"10052120","10062020"," actual price And then it has more predictive bars in front of it right here"
"10062020","10076960"," before something happens And the sweet spot for this stuff is like Right in here If"
"10076960","10085760"," that makes any sense Now you're able to look back and see how accurate it is versus previous Versus"
"10085760","10087780"," previous time in the market, right?"
"10088500","10097200"," And this part will adjust frequently like this this blue part will go It'll swing up like this and"
"10097200","10103200"," swing down like this And so this little spot right here is where where it actually does a really"
"10103200","10109040"," good job Right, it doesn't show itself It doesn't predict well over here."
"10109040","10114720"," As a matter of fact, if you run algorithms Uh, I have I have some algorithms that I run on"
"10114720","10120700"," much larger timeframes and if you if you look back to for it too much They they they they get"
"10120700","10126300"," like a reg, not regressive, but Uh, it'll it'll it'll it'll fold into itself. "
"10126880","10133020"," That's one problem with a lot of algorithms is that Uh, they'll tend to repeat themselves with too"
"10133020","10142680"," many bars Uh, so they they kind of they kind of like spiral out of control Uh, where where we"
"10142680","10150220"," have like they'll really spiral out of control like this and uh What they don't have in their what"
"10150220","10155140"," they don't have is they don't have Um unpredictable events in the market, right things information."
"10155480","10174380"," They don't"
"10174380","10181840"," know Right now see if we can get bearish hair or not Bear is looking for a crossover of the"
"10181840","10209540"," white line over the red line Fair"
"10209540","10225200"," market low is in per urban caramels our indicator Hmm, I don't believe so I disagree Okay, I'll"
"10225200","10230860"," tell you what man you see the if you see the bottom in the unemployment rate And they start fucking"
"10230860","10236540"," they start printing that unemployment rate Starts starts coming higher and you start to see that"
"10236540","10243780"," that um That uh, the fed funds rate get cut So i'm fucking warning if you're a bull out there"
"10243780","10249480"," and you don't think that this market's gonna roll over on note that jit Every single time it does"
"10249480","10256420"," that's what you're waiting for That's what you look if you're a bull or me at least that's what i'm"
"10256420","10263360"," looking for I'm looking for that unemployment rates start turning up like we're really truly"
"10263360","10269180"," turning up And then the fed's fun right to get cut That's going to be a big leg should be"
"10277840","10287660"," The yield curve inversion though man It needs that to"
"10287660","10292340"," happen the yield curve inversion can go up and go Steel curve yield curve version go all over the"
"10292340","10301440"," place If we're still raising rates and unemployment is still low The yield curve version can roll"
"10301440","10306340"," right over and head straight down to the depths of how the market will still trade sideways and up"
"10308300","10321730"," It's kind of wild I"
"10321730","10328790"," always wonder why people use that Like all by itself the yield curve version i'm always wondering"
"10328790","10335110"," why they use that as If you have time today if the market closes today if you're tuning in right"
"10335110","10341990"," now And if the market closes i'll show you instances where The yield curve inversion rolls right"
"10341990","10344590"," over and the market continues higher if you want to look at it."
"10344590","10353350"," I can show it to you Uh, I don't know why people separate that from Their arguments they need to"
"10353350","10360990"," be mixed in with rates and unemployment You need all three And they need inflation bottoming out"
"10360990","10371800"," Not Not just coming down it's like it's like this like magic sauce I"
"10371800","10377540"," wonder if you could write a I wonder if you could write a bot for that I wonder if there's"
"10377540","10378780"," a way to write a bot for that. "
"10378780","10384660"," I bet there is A way to write a bot for all four of those together to give you some"
"10384660","10390260"," kind of a lead if you could do like a prediction on the path of You do a prediction on"
"10390260","10394480"," the path of the of the unemployment rate Forget that we don't really care."
"10394620","10406420"," We just you know that a trigger would be the fed funds Rate Being cut But"
"10406420","10410840"," I have to figure that I mean i'll talk to my guy and see if there's a way to Write"
"10410840","10420690"," an alert for that We can back test it against history and"
"10420690","10429570"," see if it if it produces results every time we've had a market crash Oh, yeah, baby book club"
"10429570","10439180"," reading Yeah, and so I I think I can set alerts"
"10439180","10448360"," on I agree with you uh winky that I could probably set alerts on specific prices Not prices but"
"10448360","10456720"," percentages on each one of those um lines I But you'd want like uh that there's got to be a"

"14400790","14402450"," the hourly is turning to the bull side."
"14402610","14407310"," This is probably a bottom in here somewhere Even though vix is not saying it. "
"14407490","14416130"," I think it's a fucking lie I'm gonna try to scoop some of these up right here and I'm gonna"

"14417790","14423530"," Okay, so I'm gonna go over two tickers with you Uh one because I missed one earlier this morning"
"14423530","14427250"," that I was requested And then I was just requested another one."
"14427250","14435670"," I'm gonna start with this one first called a VIRT Uh, they are market maker right there a bank Um"
"14438170","14440070"," That they and that was their market maker. "
"14440290","14443070"," They make money on Contracts put call contracts."
"14443210","14447950"," We've got zero dates in the market right now Uh tons of them, right?"
"14448210","14451430"," We've got exponential growth on the zero day market."
"14451570","14460330"," So they're must be making bank on these puts and calls They get a cut of every options contract I"
"14460330","14465210"," Make the market for and with the volume of spy calls and puts they have to be making crazy money"
"14465210","14470310"," the stock is at $18 The 52 week high is $38. "
"14470670","14472410"," These are fundamental reasons, right?"
"14472650","14472670"," Now."
"14472750","14486060"," We know that fundamentals don't mean shit Um, hold on a second here I'm"
"14486060","14502580"," gonna look up a VIRT in the background here real quick They're"
"14502580","14510340"," still in a decline right now Uh, they're only on two triggers But I'll bring them up."
"14510500","14515420"," We'll take a look at them real quick I'm gonna take a second way away from this for just a"
"14515420","14524900"," second Then I'm gonna get a second one over here too because by request um This is VIRT right here"
"14526480","14532180"," Trade at $18.42. I don't know a lot about this company, but I get the point behind it It's"
"14532180","14533520"," kind of free-floating right now. "
"14533740","14537440"," So the issue here with VIRT is It's trading underneath."
"14537780","14542740"," It's hourly and daily down here And you don't want to see it trading underneath."
"14543000","14543280"," It's daily. "
"14543580","14545040"," You don't want to see it trading on it It's hourly."
"14545360","14546280"," You want to see it recapture."
"14546460","14555540"," So just put a watch list out there for this stock What you look for is I"
"14555540","14565360"," want to see it trade above 1869 1886 and even trade above You want to see it recapture"
"14566200","14573800"," Uh, 19 1959-1944 So if you can see this get recaptured, it's possible. "
"14574100","14582640"," It's it's something to watch It's not something that you want to be uh in right now But it's"
"14582640","14588340"," certainly worth watching and there is some consolidation Problem is we still have some we still"
"14588340","14594480"," it's not quite consolidated you had some consolidation in here And uh, they sold it right down,"
"14594620","14594740"," right?"
"14595160","14603220"," So now you get trap buyers down below here and uh Trying to fight for this for this bottoming down"
"14603220","14612120"," here none of this is showing an end to the downward move in this in this ticker Nothing showing an"
"14612120","14619220"," end to it Uh, so you want to see we we we we talk about this in streams sometimes Instead"
"14619220","14620420"," of catching a falling knife."
"14620760","14627480"," You want to see certain things happen uh It's very easy to do right you just snap a line and"
"14627480","14631340"," snap out of the line Just like that, right?"
"14632940","14636240"," If it breaks through this consolidation, it's distribution, right?"
"14636500","14646170"," But if it does spend some time here Uh You'll see it be range bound and it might"
"14646170","14654070"," briefly Uh, come underneath and then start to make a move Right and you want to see this new"
"14654070","14661000"," consolidation in here And then it'll go higher something like that."
"14661280","14666340"," Uh, what you're looking for is uh You don't want to get involved in this, right?"
"14666580","14676440"," You don't want to get Um Something like that would be blue And"
"14681200","14691140"," Something like this is orange Over here You want to see price You"
"14691140","14692980"," want to see price hold here, right?"
"14693180","14696980"," You don't want to see like this this so I don't you don't even want to buy this with a"
"14696980","14702380"," stop underneath You just want to just watch it Work itself out in here and you've got some places"
"14702380","14707060"," here where they're going to try to sell you up Uh, so there are some places of danger above, right?"
"14707800","14709220"," There's some sellers right there. "
"14709220","14717640"," They'll try to wear out You got some more sellers right here above And you really want to get above"
"14717640","14725240"," this like 23 bucks or so For the real move in this ticker Now all of this can be Wiped"
"14725240","14726920"," out the moment that you trade under it."
"14726940","14731780"," So if you start seeing any kind of nonsense like this You know trade under here and it starts to"
"14731780","14732120"," reject."
"14732460","14733900"," It hasn't finished yet, right?"
"14734060","14741600"," It's just going to continue down on its path So it's not quite there for me But I get the"
"14741600","14749580"," point I get the point it's worth watching Let me check the other one that I was asked to look"
"14749580","14758360"," at Geo I"
"14758360","14771070"," was asked to look at geo today Interesting. "

"22604820","22611880"," Just huge moves in our market right We always talk about how Uh the 50s were a time right, but"
"22611880","22613660"," what happened overall in the 50s."
"22613920","22622980"," This is in 1957 1959 1962 1966 right market even though we go we dip we trade higher we dip"
"22622980","22628760"," we trade higher we could dip no market crash here right nothing major You see what i'm saying here?"
"22629020","22634080"," No market crash like people are talking about Uh, this is 1966 right?"
"22634660","22636520"," This I guess you're going to call a market crash. "
"22636860","22637740"," What was going on here?"
"22637780","22641580"," You want to come back and look at this stuff Right, but was it really a market crash?"
"22641680","22643460"," This is a sideways market here."
"22643840","22651380"," I want you to see that this is a sideways market 1969 right here right how bad was this crash"
"22651380","22655020"," doesn't look too bad to me It's kind of big, but it doesn't look too bad."
"22655160","22659260"," You want to look down here and find out what was going on this fed rate See the front running"
"22659260","22660540"," of the cutting of rates here. "
"22660920","22666680"," You see that front running of the cutting of rates Uh, do you see the unrate down below is"
"22666680","22669900"," bottoming and then starts the climb after right?"
"22670060","22675340"," This is when they broke something so they front ran the cutting of rates when you're looking at"
"22675340","22681520"," that when you're looking at the when you see Jerome Powell saying in a in a in a meeting We're"
"22681520","22682940"," not done raising rates."
"22683280","22683320"," Now."
"22683560","22688740"," We think we have to raise rates some more That's because you've got someone behind the scenes going"
"22688740","22693920"," the moment this fucking guy says we're pausing rates Probably the bottom of the unemployment rate"
"22693920","22698200"," is going to start ripping and he's going to cut rates And we're going to start front running the"
"22698200","22699240"," selling down on the market. "
"22699240","22705140"," Does that make sense to you Don't wait to see that right You got people out there saying well,"
"22705280","22707200"," you're going to see a spike in inflation, right?"
"22707500","22708500"," That doesn't really matter though."
"22708640","22713960"," What matters is the cutting of rates And the cutting of rate the fed funds rates and the"
"22713960","22720300"," unemployment rate actually bottoming here Very important unemployment rates a huge one here You can"
"22720300","22726280"," see it right down here right unemployment rate is Anticipated to raise and they cut rates right"
"22726280","22726520"," here."
"22726600","22726940"," BAM. "
"22727100","22731120"," They cut rates and we go down Right they anticipate us cutting rates right here."
"22731260","22738020"," They held rates In 1973, but we went straight down Right they thought we were cutting rates here"
"22738020","22744060"," and look at that unemployment is coming up very important unemployment Inflation coming up right"
"22744060","22750440"," here in 1973 Right same kind of stuff rolls right over Let's take a look at this one right here."
"22750480","22756380"," The market actually goes up here From 1973 bottom and start trading up higher hold on a second here"
"22759640","22761940"," Ink tighter and look at this low. "
"22762140","22763540"," I mean look at this crash, right?"
"22764100","22766600"," You have to think about what people are talking about crashes."
"22767140","22768200"," This is 1970."
"22768320","22777160"," We crashed to 619 dollars Right on may of 1970 right And you'd think if if you were if you"
"22777160","22782280"," were talking if you talked to a collapsed person They're like, oh, yeah, we're gonna crash anyways,"
"22782480","22788540"," bro And guess where that crash was 619 Right, and this is 600 dollars. "
"22788740","22793340"," You had a tradable bottom here in the 1960s and 70s."
"22793340","22798900"," This is a tradable bottom tradable bottom look at that you didn't get a crash You got to bottom the"
"22798900","22803420"," body to trade up you got another bottom the body to trade up You see that another bottom in here"
"22803420","22810720"," to trade in the in the stock market absolutely different than Then then what you're told on"
"22812140","22816780"," Unfinance bro a finance bro specifically you're telling you this we're gonna crash I'm like, what's"
"22816780","22817220"," the price?"
"22817300","22822880"," I want to know the fucking price Because we just traded down to 345 in this market, right or for"
"22822880","22829860"," excuse me So you just trade a I think it was 345 3450 or something It's like what is bottom"
"22829860","22830740"," is it 3000?"
"22831160","22833860"," Does that mean that I can trade this up at 345?"
"22834380","22837580"," Does that mean they can trade this up from 3000 Do you know what I'm saying?"
"22838200","22840440"," Some people are claiming market crash, right?"
"22840620","22847180"," Can you imagine being a bear or a collapsed bear at least and saying Saying don't buy this bottom"
"22847180","22847720"," right here."
"22847820","22852760"," We haven't hit bottom yet When you could have actually bought that bottom Don't buy this bottom"
"22852760","22853000"," yet. "
"22853160","22857180"," We haven't hit bottom yet when you actually could have bought that bottom there It doesn't make"
"22857180","22862900"," sense to you if they're pretty fucking close Right, so you could have actually traded that bottom"
"22862900","22867580"," the crazy part is you can hedge this shit too Now, I don't know if we're going to continue down"
"22867580","22870760"," this path, but look at it again There's 619 now."
"22870900","22872900"," We have a new low above here at 739."
"22873360","22881760"," This is 1978 Right you got another low down here in 1981 Um, so we have to look at this"
"22881760","22883080"," stuff to be honest with you. "
"22883080","22890320"," Okay Cutting of rates raising of unemployment inflation coming down so inflation is not the best"
"22890320","22896840"," indicator is it Every now and again inflation here works and it doesn't work Every now and again"
"22897480","22899160"," The two-year works and doesn't work."
"22899180","22904280"," What really works though is unemployment or at least the anticipation of higher unemployment in the"
"22904280","22906360"," cutting of rates Does that make sense?"
"22906860","22913440"," Those are two key ones that seem to be consistent So when we're in a fed meeting And I'm like"
"22913440","22915600"," what am I what am I what am I waiting for?"
"22915720","22920620"," I'm waiting for the fucking fed to pause rates Moment the moment they pause rates and especially"
"22920620","22925340"," I'm staring at unemployment I'm like as unemployment bottoming right now as it's starting to rise"
"22925340","22926020"," right now."
"22926040","22927500"," Are they going to cut rates right now?"
"22928140","22929600"," Very important to know in this market. "
"22929740","22936260"," It's the most consistent Thing to know right now As far as I'm concerned The two-year can roll"
"22936260","22943120"," right over in the market can blast higher and I'll show you that in the future too I'll show you"
"22943120","22953020"," that in the future here Right here what happened The anticipation of cutting"
"22953020","22960220"," rates we didn't cut rates 1987 flash crash You guys remember 1987 this one caught everybody's"
"22960220","22969280"," drawers down in the flash crash Look at this though Two-year kept going up Not a good indicator"
"22969280","22976000"," right Because I can show you where two-year comes down and we don't get a crash Right we've"
"22976000","22982040"," actually got on up the the unemployment rate coming down still Right we've got inflation rising"
"22982040","22988420"," flash crash some people blame this crash On the introduction of computers into the market It's a"
"22988420","22994100"," hard one to look at and really define how that we got that crash But look at here."
"22994260","22997520"," We've got two-year coming down and the market's grinding higher."
"22997520","23002600"," Look at just grind higher here Right just keeps grinding higher inflation rate to me means nothing"
"23003300","23005180"," Right we had a little bit of a crash here though. "
"23005360","23006260"," What was going on here?"
"23006840","23008100"," What was happening right here?"
"23008280","23014540"," Oh there it is Cutting of rates The bottom of unemployment's rising that's it that's one you want"
"23014540","23018420"," to know Can you imagine being told over here though?"
"23018680","23025580"," Don't buy this bottom bro Don't buy this bottom and look where the next bottom is higher That's how"
"23025580","23031720"," this market runs believe it or not Every time you hear somebody say We haven't seen bottom yet"
"23031720","23038560"," question becomes and we are going to go into two big examples here Where we didn't see bottom Right"
"23038560","23044900"," and this is uh 1998 leading into 2000 crash and we have another example in 2008."
"23044900","23046780"," Can you imagine being back here?"
"23047860","23050320"," Just imagine this being back here, right?"
"23050660","23060470"," I want to show it when I put this on a weekly here Just imagine Where's 2000 right here?"
"23063550","23071770"," Do they can Bring this out before you so you can see this There's a weekly chart right here Okay,"
"23071770","23076970"," we had a we had a bottom back in 1990 And you've got someone screaming we haven't hit bottom yet."
"23076970","23077890"," We haven't hit bottom yet. "
"23077890","23078830"," We haven't hit bottom yet."
"23078830","23081550"," We haven't hit bottom yet We haven't hit bottom yet."
"23081550","23082550"," We haven't hit bottom yet. "
"23082570","23090170"," Even when we got a bottom here Even when we got a bottom here guess what happened The bloodbath of"
"23090170","23095930"," 2000 guess what happened You're right back to if you had just bought the fucking bottom back here."
"23095950","23098450"," You were still up Does it make sense?"
"23099230","23105590"," So every bottom there's a buying opportunity in this market It's for a decade two decades three"
"23105590","23110950"," decades four decades every time you hear bottom and this isn't the last bottom Telling you what"
"23110950","23112390"," there are buyable bottoms out there."
"23112450","23114830"," I promise you You got bears in here. "
"23115010","23118310"," They were just bearish bearish bearish and by the luck of their ass."

"23130970","23135590"," You know where they got the swap money from right fucking here and down Just down in here if we"
"23135590","23143650"," didn't do this down here he would have been broke His investors would have gotten torched Does that"
"23143650","23144650"," make sense for you?"
"23144790","23150450"," How long do they wait for that to happen even then with this crash Had you been long back here"
"23150450","23151410"," in the 90s?"
"23151550","23156990"," You didn't even feel it You even fucking feel as a matter of fact you were making banked up in"
"23156990","23163310"," here just tons of bank So you guys get what I'm saying here See the front running of rates right"

"23302800","23303460"," Did you hear him today?"
"23303680","23311180"," They said you probably can't cut rates until 2024 Because they're telling you that because you"
"23311180","23315600"," because there are there are smart people out there that are saying Well, I was gonna be the next"
"23315600","23316160"," one of three months. "
"23316400","23318100"," Should we start shorting the fuck out of the market right here?"
"23318320","23319400"," You're seeing it actively right."
"23319540","23325560"," We have south side of the market right now The south side is like I'll just short this shit every"
"23325560","23330840"," quarter and it's going to hit one time regardless of what the fed says I'm going to fight the fed"
"23330840","23331620"," for four quarters."
"23332080","23337240"," I'm going to buy cheap hedges in this market And if it hits one out of four times, I'm going"

"23344640","23350920"," time You can build your own you can build your own two-year 10-year yield curve version. "
"23350920","23357380"," I think it'll go farther back in time, but you should be focusing on two things in my view uh,"
"23357460","23363640"," which is unemployment And fed funds rate and the front running of it."
"23363800","23365160"," When do they decide to do the front running?"
"23365760","23368440"," What does the market look like as they're front running?"
"23368580","23371420"," It just kind of looks top of here doesn't it on a larger scale?"
"23372320","23377100"," Right this looks kind of top of here to me But you I can certainly see this market go like"
"23377100","23381740"," go just like this There's 2024 right here."
"23381760","23387100"," You see some nastiness like this It can remain and it can remain irrational longer than you can"
"23387100","23392980"," remain solvent as a retail trader until they finally dump it down here And what is the price of"
"23392980","23400360"," that dumping if the market goes up to 460 If this market goes up to 460 yeah, can a bickel"

"23485480","23492080"," good if not in this bottom holds Right if this bottom holds right here you buy this bottom Right"
"23492080","23498000"," and trade this down you buy this bottom trade this down because you'll look back in I assure you"
