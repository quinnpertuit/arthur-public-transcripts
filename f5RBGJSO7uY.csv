"190","3870"," A complete adjustment of focus and sound level before the film begins."
"12590","15290"," This leader is provided to permit the projection."
"96720","98900"," Say, good morning out there. "
"100840","102020"," Just a second here."
"103600","105520"," I'm having some technical issues this morning."
"105680","107580"," I was supposed to be on an 8.30. That didn't happen. "
"109000","110140"," It's more in my end."
"110240","112140"," I had to call my broker this morning."
"118820","123220"," Switch right over to the mainstream here. "
"124080","124600"," Good morning."
"124740","125180"," How y'all doing?"
"125280","125640"," Happy Monday."
"130360","130800"," Okay. "
"131000","131360"," Hold on here."
"140100","141400"," Still having some walkiness."
"145580","146220"," Who's that?"
"146780","148020"," Hang tight for just one second. "
"148140","151020"," I've got some quick stuff, technical stuff in the background to do."
"152820","154220"," So not a good morning, right?"
"154800","155180"," We know that."
"155360","156780"," We've got one minute left until the open here. "
"156880","158760"," I'll switch over to the one minute to see what goes on here."
"160020","162260"," I can get this to a..."
"164400","166580"," Yeah, still having some walkiness right now, too."
"179750","180990"," We should find some buyers here. "
"181170","183130"," We'll end up talking about the open this morning."
"183250","183750"," What's happening?"
"184290","190390"," We wound up selling the hourly trigger this morning right off of the..."
"190390","193450"," You can actually see Book Map having issues with as well."
"196510","200630"," So we did have selling this morning off of the hourly trigger. "
"201890","204010"," I'll show you that right now."
"205590","209610"," Right before the op, we even get past the hourly trigger, let alone the daily trigger."
"216820","218240"," We bring that up for you. "
"219160","220960"," We sold the hourly trigger this morning."
"221540","223160"," Didn't get up to the..."
"226840","229080"," It's a noting following the cash equity open here."
"229200","232580"," The S&P bank index down 6.3% off of the open again. "
"235440","236520"," We're going to talk about..."
"241670","247730"," We're going to talk about the crisis that was created by venture capitalists."
"248530","250070"," All of their own doing."
"250130","253230"," Why I see you have hosted first Republic for additional information. "
"254570","256649"," All of their own doing this morning."
"256810","257490"," You can't really..."
"258510","268460"," You honestly can't blame anyone but them, panicking over, screaming and"
"268460","268660"," crying."
"268660","275640"," I was just talking to a guy on the phone this morning about these venture capitalists and big"
"275640","275940"," money. "
"276160","282620"," You got liquidity providers out there holding press conferences on Twitter over the weekend."
"284260","285740"," It doesn't look good."
"286080","293180"," What it does regardless of what Biden says or Yellen says or the Fed says, it creates panic. "
"293800","296000"," We talked about that on our Sunday show."
"296680","303020"," When you create that panic in the marketplace or not the marketplace, but just in general..."
"304360","306420"," All people remember this shit."
"308640","310300"," I think yesterday..."
"310300","312940"," I was talking to my friend and I said, you know what?"
"313140","320760"," I said every CFO, very company on a phone call, at some point either heading into the weekend or"
"320760","323660"," over the weekend and said, how much exposure do we have?"
"326660","328440"," It doesn't matter where their bank is. "
"328540","329580"," It doesn't matter if it's a prime bank."
"331300","337760"," By Monday morning I want to know, start making moves and you're seeing that play out this morning."
"338240","343680"," You're more than likely going to see that play out as banks open on the West Coast this morning as"
"343680","343920"," well. "
"346560","350820"," It starts on the East Coast and then it'll continue on in the West Coast."
"354060","363200"," It's not good enough to have Yellen saying they're going to protect the investors and fuck"
"363200","366180"," the banks themselves."
"367400","369540"," All of this is not healthy. "
"372400","376580"," The least healthy part is the advent of social media."
"376580","379540"," It really is."
"380280","388780"," I want to swear right now and say, just shut your mouth because you can't believe that these people"
"388780","398700"," that have control of millions of dollars, some billions are on fucking Twitter, hearing their"
"398700","399320"," dirty laundry. "
"400640","403720"," Then you've got reporters inside of these spaces."
"404780","407080"," You've got all kinds of people inside of these spaces."
"407440","414200"," You've got people that are then rebroadcasting these spaces to people that control money. "
"415580","416940"," It's just pure insanity."
"417780","424040"," I know some of you are probably like, I love it, but truth is, it's never been done before and"
"424040","427400"," its effect is unknown at best."
"430380","435440"," In other times that would be considered, by Buddy said, that's this morning too, he said. "
"436540","446260"," In other times this would be considered illegal because they're creating scares in the marketplace."
"447260","452420"," The banking industry, I still have some technical stuff I got here in the background."
"452420","458400"," I saw Tesla sell off this morning. "
"458400","459240"," It's funny too."
"459540","463580"," We talked about the healthy looking chart versus a non-healthy looking chart yesterday."
"463760","467440"," You're looking at Nvidia this morning versus Tesla. "
"471620","473880"," Which one is worse this morning?"
"474120","474880"," You can see it, right?"
"475220","476600"," It's pretty fairly easy to see."
"488270","490870"," You're probably going to see this all morning."
"490870","495350"," You're likely as banks open around the country, as different time zones open. "
"496610","497730"," We're not even waiting."
"498010","499550"," We're not even waiting this morning."
"499750","501510"," We sold right off the hourly like it was nothing. "
"502230","504590"," It was like Buddy didn't even get up there to even test it."
"504810","507570"," The daily trigger is flying down now."
"508190","510130"," It's at 398-32 currently. "
"512289","514510"," So you can see this in a better time frame here."
"515390","521850"," Now Spy's not showing it the sell off on it this morning, but ES does show it."
"523610","525250"," It's probably not done. "
"525550","529350"," We're going to grind through some levels down below."
"536970","540510"," We'll look at the one month right here just so you can see it."
"540510","548500"," One of these bands out that we had from December. "
"550520","556240"," I'm going to mute book map here for a moment."
"558380","560320"," Just so you can see this band here."
"560520","562700"," This is the December buying here. "
"564640","566320"," We'll drop some boxes."
"566540","571320"," I deleted them this morning because I wanted you to see them right in here."
"571540","572400"," It would be the first. "
"577170","579970"," It's going to be the yellow one that you had over the weekend that I gave to you."
"580530","582630"," I'm going to drop a red one in down below here."
"584110","587770"," The truth is right down here. "
"590580","592000"," Like real trading range."
"594300","594780"," 374."
"597440","600980"," And once this is broken here, this is the thing we talked about on Sunday. "
"602060","606440"," The only thing holding this market up there was weekly and monthly momentum."
"607460","610800"," As soon as it was broken, there's no bottom."
"611060","616720"," Not only is there no bottom, but you only have your at the liberty of institutions holding this"
"616720","617680"," market up at this point. "
"618160","620720"," From any buying that they did in October and December."
"622080","624320"," And nothing else holds this market up."
"624800","624980"," Nothing. "
"630810","634750"," You saw me post this on at captain's alpha."
"636050","637030"," Weeks ago."
"639030","639690"," Talked about it. "
"639750","640250"," Talked about it."
"640310","640910"," Talked about it."
"640990","643010"," And then you're seeing it right now play out this morning. "
"645030","646850"," You're seeing this support."
"647430","648910"," We're just burning right through it."
"648910","650330"," We've got one more down below, right?"
"650530","651850"," We've got October lows. "
"657390","660470"," Then it's not a shocker, but you at least expected."
"660990","662290"," Well, I didn't."
"662290","668390"," In the overnight, we traded up into this morning and slammed off twice off the early trigger this"
"668390","668710"," morning. "
"671190","676330"," Didn't didn't slam into it and look for look look for a one in five minutes."
"676330","676990"," Keep coming up."
"677250","679750"," It was just slamming of the hourly starts on it. "
"681910","683110"," And here it is right here."
"683210","685790"," This is the early this this green box right here."
"689390","692330"," I did leave this one up, but this is the early right here. "
"692970","698010"," Teed off it once teed off it again with some with some with some really fast prints."
"698010","699430"," If you're watching that this morning."
"703310","704110"," Right there. "
"705070","708170"," And not surprisingly, this is the same level that they bought."
"708450","712570"," Remember we tagged this on I think it was sixty three or something like that."
"712770","714550"," Three four sixty three down here and Friday. "
"716450","719870"," And you know, you bought it up came right into the early trigger."
"720190","722490"," Didn't even get to the early and just pause."
"722530","723810"," It was just sell into it. "
"724350","727190"," Didn't wait for the daily to sell into sold right on the hourly."
"728510","732990"," And slamming down through any kind of support there is the market currently this morning."
"733550","734730"," And they did this again. "
"737490","742170"," They did this again back in February, heading into the end of the month for March."
"742930","744430"," On the weekly and monthly triggers."
"745450","746470"," And they're now doing this. "
"746710","747650"," We don't have anything below."
"748090","756630"," We only have where at the where at the where at"
"756630","760210"," the."
"760210","765010"," And they control the selling at this point, right?"
"765210","767090"," We have no real support underneath the market here. "
"769620","771420"," Now does that mean we crash today?"
"774420","779860"," I think I think that volatility rains as core inflation is quite persistent."
"780480","783540"," Probably until at least 12 o'clock."
"785340","787760"," West Coast West Coast isn't done here. "
"787900","789960"," You know that there's going to be panic on the West Coast."
"791400","793340"," And until their banks open."
"795060","797120"," I would expect volatility down here. "
"797760","800040"," Do I think we crashed this level right now at this moment?"
"800220","800820"," Probably not."
"802060","804080"," But they're trying to grind through it, right?"
"806950","812570"," Sellers are selling into whatever known buyers we have down below here in December."
"813870","817250"," And again down in October is below this level here. "
"817650","819610"," That's down at that three forty five three sixty five."
"823850","825090"," Oh, I got down below."
"827470","833690"," What's crazy is to is I've got I've got a puts and calls for today. "
"834350","836890"," I actually have crash puts on the market right now."
"838550","842350"," So I'm like I bought calls for the bell here on Friday."
"842530","846750"," And I've actually got crash puts just in just in case of this happening. "
"852150","854330"," Just in case of this happening this morning."
"860560","862760"," My boy Nino's in the house this morning."
"862860","863760"," It's good to see him here. "
"868100","870220"," Good seeing Nino in the room this morning."
"874370","876250"," Trying to grind through S1 right now."
"876370","877190"," It's two and S3. "
"879050","881050"," Let me just a second area to post some stuff."
"890080","892040"," And we've got CPI on Tuesday."
"893580","894480"," Any kind of a."
"895780","897700"," I mean, let's look at it honestly, right?"
"898160","899360"," We sold up into the hourly. "
"899360","900740"," Couldn't hold it."
"901280","903220"," Velocity is moving down quickly."
"904660","906240"," On the daily and the hourly trigger. "
"908760","914640"," The daily trigger at the daily trigger right now or daily velocity is negative as as all flying"
"914640","914880"," out."
"915180","915720"," It's negative."
"917760","919500"," You've got on Tuesday CPI. "
"920960","922280"," You've got end of the month, right?"
"922420","923360"," You get OPEC's on the 17th."
"924460","925820"," You've got the FOMC meeting."
"926300","928200"," You've got Yellen out there talking. "
"928200","930400"," You've got Biden out there talking."
"930540","936920"," You've got all these VC's not just VC's, but you've got market or liquidity providers for the"
"936920","939440"," market screaming inside of Twitter."
"939720","941220"," Of all places. "
"943060","944560"," A few pure disaster."
"960200","963200"," Trying to find some kind of support right here in the market right now."
"968910","973850"," This is a one minute chart right now in terms of can you trade this?"
"974590","975190"," No. "
"982130","983210"," It's bearish."
"983550","985590"," This whole morning, this whole open is bearish."
"986790","988310"," Can you trade this as a bull?"
"988630","988730"," No. "
"998390","999330"," You need to see."
"1006920","1008740"," You're talking something like this."
"1013990","1016150"," Then needing to see price get above. "
"1023940","1026640"," All this kind of nonsense here to be talking about."
"1027540","1029619"," Are we bullish or are we bearish?"
"1029619","1035839"," Right now, we're trading $3.81, probably $3.85 or something like that."
"1036700","1039280"," 40 point move to even be getting bullish here. "
"1043750","1045790"," It's good turning one of those days possible."
"1046890","1048510"," If you're wondering it is possible."
"1050090","1056010"," And at the least expecting volatility into let's say 12 o'clock Eastern Standard Time. "
"1064280","1065800"," I got a bunch of stuff for you guys."
"1065800","1075300"," I've got pictures of everyone that donated on Friday with the kids eating pizza and"
"1075300","1076400"," bowling."
"1077040","1077880"," I haven't put them up yet. "
"1077960","1079660"," I'm going to put them up this morning at some point for you."
"1080060","1082700"," I didn't want to post it all on on Twitter."
"1083580","1085520"," So I figured I posted for here for you. "
"1085560","1088700"," So if you donated on Friday, I got some cool stuff for you today."
"1091120","1094340"," And I had some technical stuff to get take care of this morning."
"1094340","1096080"," I thought I would be on at eight thirty. "
"1096360","1098680"," It took me an hour to get it all sorted out."
"1100500","1104320"," Book maps lending itself saying that there is some kind of support here."
"1104900","1105900"," I wouldn't trust it. "
"1105960","1106720"," I'll be honest with you."
"1107880","1109320"," I wouldn't trust it at all."
"1110080","1111840"," And I wouldn't trust it until we're trading. "
"1112240","1116960"," We're trading above three eighty three forty three five sixty seven."
"1117500","1119000"," I'll go to a one minute chart here."
"1122340","1123780"," Even here in this one minute. "
"1124660","1126340"," It's super dangerous here."
"1129570","1132910"," You know in a one minute chart you want to see price get above."
"1134330","1137610"," Three eighty three oh nine and then retest for a trade higher. "
"1141150","1142030"," Very dangerous."
"1142030","1143210"," Very volatile place."
"1143430","1145630"," Tesla just getting destroyed right now. "
"1146310","1147090"," Or not right now."
"1147270","1149330"," But earlier this morning we take a look at Tesla real quick."
"1167040","1170760"," Yeah, you see this see this yellow box down here that's forming on Tesla. "
"1171940","1173360"," The bottom right inside your screen."
"1173820","1176720"," You can barely see it but there's a yellow line down here."
"1177320","1178600"," Very unhealthy on the day. "
"1179100","1180120"," The hourly looks positive."
"1180620","1182520"," The five minute the one minute all the positive."
"1183260","1186280"," But the daily velocity is very unhealthy here. "
"1197150","1199890"," We should be expecting the Bank of England to sell results."
"1212120","1217340"," What you didn't want to see was price to break below this one sixty this one seventy."
"1217340","1220540"," I want you to see this here. "
"1220720","1226620"," I want you to watch this daily trigger is curling violently over on Tesla right now."
"1230080","1230980"," Not good."
"1231820","1234480"," Rolling over on Tesla currently this morning. "
"1235220","1237420"," We're trading underneath the hourly on Tesla."
"1238520","1241740"," Trading underneath the weekly and the monthly on Tesla."
"1249790","1251310"," Not what you want to see here. "
"1254090","1256890"," It looks like something that Tesla is going to get sold into."
"1257790","1258770"," You catch a bounce."
"1258990","1261670"," I'm going to get rid of this stuff here so you can see it more clearly. "
"1263290","1266190"," This is going to turn into resistance."
"1271910","1274650"," What you're going to end up seeing here is you're going to end up seeing."
"1277190","1279510"," These triggers come down on top of Tesla. "
"1279910","1281670"," So let's look at this for a moment."
"1281670","1286510"," And I want you to make this clearer than it is here."
"1296630","1300090"," And I got some moving to do here to make all this. "
"1313580","1316280"," Sellers are sitting at one eighty five thirty two on Tesla."
"1317200","1319340"," One seventy six thirteen on Tesla."
"1322480","1324300"," Tesla needs to claw its way back. "
"1327840","1332540"," Above this one seventy six and then above one eighty four or so."
"1332840","1336580"," And get the hourly to come underneath get the one minute the five minute."
"1337540","1338840"," For a squeeze higher. "
"1340280","1341400"," As of right now."
"1342760","1344320"," Can't try to trust Tesla."
"1344860","1348320"," As of right now velocity on the daily is where it's at on Tesla. "
"1350560","1353540"," It's looking to sell the daily looks horrible on Tesla right now."
"1359360","1362000"," It's a one eighty four one eighty five somewhere in there."

"3411700","3418220"," They've been doing this all the way back into the ninth on Thursday, just teeing off, teeing off"
"3418220","3424180"," here, teeing off this morning, and they're teeing off right now, very dangerous for the market"
"3424180","3424400"," here."
"3424400","3426460"," Now, we do have some support here. "
"3426540","3431140"," We know we've got support down to three seventy four, but the selling and grinding into this three"
"3431140","3433760"," seventy four is what's most concerning."
"3434580","3436140"," The more time that you spend."
"3438280","3442120"," The more time that you spend here, let me go sit here and bring up a five day chart. "
"3450160","3454940"," This yellow box that I deleted down here."
"3460600","3466400"," This has a lot more to do with the grinding that's taking place down here."
"3466460","3470300"," This is very similar to the last week, a week and a half of February. "
"3470960","3476620"," We break through at this moment, probably not like a clean break, probably not, but you've got"
"3476620","3482240"," selling pressure, heavy selling pressure down here, trying to grind through this support and break"
"3482240","3484040"," this part of the market."
"3484040","3494000"," And if this grind doesn't set up for selling now, it is"
"3494000","3500040"," setting itself up down the road this week next week into the 22nd."
"3500340","3506460"," The more damage that you do to this level here, the more chances we have of trading down to three"
"3506460","3509900"," sixty three forty five easily to get down there. "
"3510100","3511520"," This is all a bear wants right here."
"3512400","3517440"," Is the pressure to be on and it's grinding through this support here."
"3517520","3523780"," The more grinding that we can do down here, the more chances of us actually making a big trip south"
"3523780","3524360"," from here. "
"3542960","3545800"," Getting rid of this box, you can actually see what's going on here."
"3570160","3575740"," You've got Francis Finance Minister, Lemair, saying I do not see any specific contagion risk for"
"3575740","3578880"," France as a result of the SBB collapse."
"3578880","3580700"," I don't know how you don't see that. "
"3581020","3585420"," I don't know that it's if you get bank runs on midsize banks."
"3586720","3592560"," If you've got CFOs that are out there being told, hey, are we safe, right?"
"3593180","3596120"," You're going to see a mad dash of money into prime banks."
"3597360","3603240"," So unless you get reassurance from the Fed and from the Treasury Department, that will likely"
"3603240","3614730"," continue this morning across across the U.S. It's"
"3614730","3619050"," not quite, I mean this morning, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell from South Park and I'm like, I don't"
"3619050","3619570"," know if it's sell. "
"3620330","3623370"," It's definitely move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move."
"3625330","3627350"," It's definitely move money right now."
"3640560","3647980"," Yeah, the only position that I see here is crash protection and selling ting off above here at the"
"3647980","3648640"," salary trigger. "
"3665750","3667150"," Yeah, news is on right now."
"3670970","3675170"," Yeah, MBI doesn't mean anything right now."
"3691570","3693510"," Thoughts on FRC being halted. "
"3694770","3696730"," You got a underneath the service."
"3696970","3698630"," Think about this for a second here."
"3698770","3702070"," You got you got silver gate, right?"
"3703570","3705590"," You've got crypto down everywhere. "
"3705910","3708670"," I love how everyone's separating all of this."
"3709050","3712390"," You've got systemic risk from from exposure to crypto."
"3712390","3716030"," You've got SVB, right?"
"3716330","3717490"," It comes up last week. "
"3717590","3720090"," Now you've got other banks having runs on them right now."
"3720590","3729130"," More than you've got people that lived through 07 and 08 that know not to trust banks."
"3730370","3734510"," You've got to be expecting the Bank of England killed sale results. "
"3736550","3743170"," And as this week in unfolds, you've got coffee conversations going on across America and probably"
"3743170","3744590"," most of the free world."
"3747010","3753730"," And behind the scenes closed doors of every company in America, even my wife."
"3755990","3758610"," Called our banks on Friday, man. "
"3759070","3759830"," And she's not a."
"3761230","3763270"," You know, she knows nothing about the stock market."
"3763810","3765170"," And even she's scared."
"3765330","3766350"," All of her friends are scared. "
"3767350","3772610"," And so what are you seeing today, especially in the open across across the United States as you"
"3772610","3772810"," see."
"3772890","3778330"," The banking sector here knows in Bank of America, research cuts America's price objective to $64"
"3778330","3779870"," from $74."
"3781890","3788910"," You likely see companies ensuring that they're insured outside of FDIC, ensuring that they have"
"3788910","3792810"," insurance, ensuring that their money is safe, not even tied up. "
"3792830","3793410"," You can't have it."
"3793410","3794450"," You can't have it tied up for."
"3795790","3798770"," A month or two 07, 08, some people's money. "
"3798910","3800750"," They got it back after many months."
"3802870","3808450"," So I'm sure that the volatility this morning has a lot to do with what corporate corporations are"
"3808450","3808710"," doing."
"3811960","3815020"," And they really don't trust anything that the government says. "
"3832770","3836910"," And we're just talking about cash from the sidelines trying to come back into the market."
"3837630","3840230"," We're so far away from that right now at this moment."
"3841890","3843450"," Think about that, right?"
"3843570","3845230"," We're talking about money on the sidelines. "

"3867310","3873670"," I'd rather sit on the sidelines that employ money out there in the world, right?"
"3874650","3876670"," In the stock market."
"3898280","3909880"," FRC destroyed, utterly destroyed. "
"3912180","3913040"," Bloodbathing."
"3923400","3924160"," Halted, right?"

"4044690","4046610"," Now trading 74 cents. "
"4052180","4053300"," 76 cents."
"4058240","4061000"," I'm getting asked right now, how do I like this price action?"
"4061560","4062500"," Volatile and dangerous."
"4075420","4078640"," Vix is as bullish as it could be. "
"4083200","4085520"," I'll be honest with you."
"4087220","4090560"," It would be nothing for us to trade up here and go down 20%."
"4092100","4093840"," That's how volatile it is right now. "
"4095979","4097000"," Oh, shit, you're not."
"4103319","4104180"," And I'll show it."
"4104240","4105220"," I'll show you how that happens. "
"4105240","4106680"," If you want to see a violent reversal."
"4108660","4110020"," I'll show it to you right now."
"4113479","4115560"," You want to see a violent reversal in the making?"
"4127000","4128279"," Here's the Vix right here. "
"4129279","4130779"," You might think you're out of the woods."
"4133000","4134740"," I want you to see this right here."
"4134859","4137880"," They teed right off on the hourly, right?"
"4138120","4140100"," If Vix can get down to 2489. "
"4141180","4143140"," They're going to tee off again down here somewhere."
"4143700","4146040"," Probably $26."
"4146660","4150319"," They're going to attempt to tee off on 26 bucks on the Vix. "
"4150819","4150979"," So."
"4156250","4158950"," We're not done here is the point that I'm trying to make to you."
"4158950","4161290"," So this is the Vix right here. "
"4164050","4165770"," See that tee off this morning?"
"4166029","4167850"," 935 teed right off on it."
"4168850","4172069"," And we're it Vix is still bullish, believe it or not."
"4172170","4173729"," We could bloodbath it right down here. "
"4175290","4176770"," And T right off again on it."
"4186540","4188939"," And how does that play itself out just like this?"
"4189060","4192319"," You squeeze higher and it just starts slamming down again."
"4204740","4205640"," Wild West. "
"4210260","4212480"," This even get us a guest on the program here."
"4234950","4237130"," Yeah, I have no wants here to."
"4241610","4243890"," I'm watching FRC right now trading off 1755. "
"4245010","4246490"," I got it on another screen in the background."
"4284370","4285430"," That's my butt."
"4285650","4287590"," That's my butt if he wants to come on the show live. "
"4290710","4292750"," And he's like he's like I'm in the middle of something."
"4292970","4293930"," He's in a public place."
"4295550","4297530"," So I said to him I said I'll stick. "
"4297750","4299770"," I'll stick the phone mic up on my mic."
"4300450","4301670"," We'll cross mic swords."
"4317950","4320830"," I don't think the contagion is. "
"4320970","4322730"," I think the idea behind the contagion is."
"4323330","4326410"," It's not so much like there's the one aspect of."
"4326770","4329690"," Is there contagion we don't know about with prime banks?"
"4329950","4330930"," I wish I had the dot. "
"4331090","4332250"," There's a dot plot that shows."
"4333390","4335350"," Risk put on by different betting institutions."
"4335350","4337390"," JPM seems to be the riskiest. "
"4337690","4338550"," And it's not that risky."
"4338690","4339550"," They have more sticky money."
"4340430","4342050"," The real fair isn't. "
"4342910","4345050"," The real fair really isn't about prime banks."
"4345310","4349050"," It's more about the shuffling of money from these midsize banks."
"4350910","4353650"," That you move your money to to a larger bank, right?"
"4354030","4354810"," You have a shifting. "
"4355150","4357570"," Then you then you get runs on these midsize banks."
"4357950","4359070"," My buddy and I were telling this morning."
"4359190","4363450"," We're saying how much how many depositors does it take at a small bank. "
"4364370","4365730"," To have a run on it."
"4365850","4366870"," Probably not that many."
"4368070","4368990"," Probably not that many. "
"4369170","4371670"," Two or three large depositors in a bank."
"4372170","4373830"," Pull up $50 million, $100 million."
"4374730","4375590"," Five, six of those. "
"4376390","4378490"," And you get yourselves the starting of a run in a bank."
"4380670","4382510"," It doesn't take much on these small banks."
"4387290","4388630"," JPM is the most risky. "
"4388630","4393210"," The Biden's 2024 National Security budget request is $886 billion."
"4393770","4396570"," It has $842 billion A mark for the Pentagon."
"4415650","4417590"," All I want to do is print 390. "
"4417910","4419350"," Just print me 390, please."
"4437530","4439430"," Yeah, Mira stops in all the time."
"4440770","4442010"," I haven't seen him this morning. "
"4442790","4443850"," I haven't been on Twitter either."
"4448940","4451420"," You've got a nice Polish formation going on here."
"4452400","4453600"," This is a five minute chart. "
"4453840","4454800"," So it's getting pretty bullish here."
"4455440","4460100"," Just need time for this one minute to catch up to this red line right here."
"4460240","4461380"," I'm going to show you this red line again. "
"4461540","4463680"," We charted this out earlier this morning."
"4465480","4467880"," I want to see this red line right here come up."
"4468080","4469880"," You want to give time to the white line. "
"4472000","4474900"," To come up and get this beautiful bull cross right here."
"4475440","4481080"," And you want to watch price stay above as long as price stays above."
"4482380","4485280"," Right here should get a nice squeeze higher. "
"4486180","4487600"," That's developing at the moment."
"4489260","4492760"," You can snap or clip this screener here so you can see it."
"4493400","4496860"," Anything below if we start to break below in any significant way. "
"4497360","4502560"," If you bearish, of course, we're getting a bear arrow plane and not a bull arrow plane."
"4504640","4509340"," So I'm just watching to see if price holds underneath the white line hasn't done that yet."
"4509340","4514900"," I do want to warn you if you're out there watching this broadcast right now. "
"4515160","4515800"," It is nothing."
"4517060","4518440"," To have a crash today."
"4519140","4520100"," Very easy. "
"4524940","4529400"," If you don't think that there's risk right now for a stock market crash, I am going to warn you"
"4529400","4532980"," that there is 100% there's a risk today."
"4544300","4547340"," FRC winning its five minute or enough five minutes."
"4547340","4549280"," It's a five day EMA. "
"4549640","4551920"," It's looking to trade higher to 22 82."
"4552840","4555040"," Two targets above on FRC."
"4555920","4559060"," If it can hold price can hold an FRC at $19. "
"4560840","4566560"," If it can hold price target above of 22 82 and 27 11."
"4568540","4570960"," I assure you there's risk in this market today."
"4573780","4574420"," Guaranteed. "
"4577340","4580480"," And not only today, but in the coming weeks, coming next two weeks."
"4581700","4584180"," And it doesn't depend on what the Fed says."
"4584860","4588700"," The Fed says they're cutting rates, pausing rates, anything like that. "
"4588880","4592000"," We usually have a last leg down in the market."
"4596930","4599950"," Any kind of pause from the Fed will likely get front run."
"4602330","4605790"," And on a bad side, no bulls out there like we pause rates. "
"4606050","4606790"," We're going to go into the moon."
"4606970","4608250"," We're going to start doing all time highs."
"4609470","4610910"," Don't expect that. "
"4611350","4616070"," The invert yield curve says otherwise the rise in unemployment saying otherwise."
"4619670","4621550"," Inflation coming down and saying otherwise."
"4622010","4627530"," So there is real risk in this market in the coming weeks coming next week or two of stock market"
"4627530","4627810"," crash. "
"4627870","4630690"," One last leg down into end of quarter."
"4636510","4639070"," You can just watch the Sunday show that I did."
"4639530","4641610"," You know where you can buy in safety. "
"4641610","4643590"," You know where you can buy Tesla in safety."
"4644410","4647870"," If you're just willy nilly buying this market here saying we're just going to."
"4648090","4650050"," This is the actual bottom of the market. "
"4651150","4652250"," Very dangerous."
"4652650","4654530"," Very extremely dangerous."
"4658390","4661150"," Spoke with people just spoke with a guy this morning. "
"4661330","4662650"," Another guy spoke with a guy this morning."
"4663630","4669610"," He had a business there last night with big company heads and these big company heads."
"4670250","4671770"," They're moving money right now. "
"4673430","4679630"," They are risk off in this in this market risk off in their banking risk off in their companies."

"4690390","4693110"," fundamental analysis and preparation ahead of this release. "
"4693870","4694730"," And so again this is tomorrow."
"4695150","4698010"," A lot of video is available on the feed if you'd like to get tuned in ahead of this."
"4698010","4704110"," The price action in the stock market this morning is not indicative of normal bottoms. "
"4704610","4708170"," This price action is very very volatile very dangerous."
"4709830","4713950"," We could easily trade up here to 390 and immediately reverse lower."
"4722170","4723690"," Now trading 76 cents. "
"4725150","4726670"," On 390 C."
"4726870","4729650"," 77 cents 78 cents 80 cents."
"4732170","4734110"," I'm going to switch over to one minute."
"4737790","4739470"," I need to be able to watch. "
"4740790","4743010"," The finer details on this trade."
"4745150","4748910"," And see if I'm actually going to get up here or not."
"4756200","4758880"," To even get this nice explosive squeeze higher. "
"4760420","4762580"," Have your finger on the take profit trigger."
"4764260","4773620"," I want you to be aware of that price"
"4773620","4776740"," action that's going on in this market right now is volatile."
"4778580","4781820"," It's telling you by selling it to the tick dot com. "
"4793250","4796210"," I mean it's so the market is so volatile at this point."
"4796370","4800930"," I'm thinking I'm trying to do the math in my head and I'm like we could probably hit 390 today."
"4801190","4801810"," It's possible. "
"4802870","4807690"," We could squeeze right through the hourly blast off 100 points in a day in the middle of the"
"4807690","4808130"," afternoon."
"4808830","4809390"," Relentless."
"4811090","4812870"," In the same token. "
"4813430","4817210"," We could sell off the daily trigger here and blast down and just start hammering."
"4843820","4845120"," And just just the price."
"4845120","4846900"," Look at the price action these calls. "
"4847620","4851960"," It's like 78 cents 62 cents 52 cents 30 cents."

"5970940","5972180"," To hold here. "
"5972560","5974040"," This is the second part of that trade."
"5975000","5979060"," So it's roughly right around 391 if you can hold 391."
"5980540","5986220"," There you can take a second trade for like 80 points believe it or not now with that said. "
"5986860","5991640"," You see this selling off of off of the hourly right now right it's going to come back down and"
"5991640","5991920"," test."
"5992420","5996580"," The one minute and the five minute to ensure that this is what we're actually doing."

"6002100","6002900"," Past week."
"6004120","6007940"," We haven't come to a point where we've been able to break above the hourly."

"6013460","6019740"," This is a take profit moments until we can get above the hourly trigger and consolidate."
"6020540","6025460"," And you put your finger your trigger finger on the by to go up to that 3 to 70 80"
"6025460","6026440"," points whatever that is."
"6027120","6028140"," Now the VIX. "

"6037300","6041700"," You can see that it's teeing off it's hourly trigger the green line right here."

"6049170","6053590"," You see this kind of nonsense if if we get the trade off of the VIX here."
"6054470","6061350"," The market could roll over violently or at least you'll see some kind of retest down below in the"

"6069610","6070790"," 944 this morning."
"6075140","6079020"," So for a back on spy right here the point that I'm trying to make you is."
"6080580","6082460"," Here's our low here at 945. "
"6083200","6088200"," It would be nothing for us to trade up here and blast straight down and retest this low down here."
"6092590","6097790"," Right nothing for us to do that right now on on the spy and then come back up again believe"
"6097790","6104380"," it or not."
"6104380","6107520"," You're investing itself take this trade higher into this green bar. "
"6108340","6116240"," Your next big trade on spy is only once price comes above consolidates above here and then you"
"6116240","6118820"," start attacking like literally 80 points above."
"6124060","6124880"," Does that make sense?"
"6125940","6127420"," They're already tagged one here."
"6128960","6135480"," And that's how that's how quick this can move so above this early trigger will get bullish again. "
"6136580","6144300"," Below this early trigger easily easily come back down here and retest these lows today."
"6146540","6152920"," This is actually on board today to retest these lows on a rejection above here."
"6153040","6156320"," So we reject here we will go back down and see these lows. "
"6157440","6162120"," Any kind of a trade above the early trigger that consolidates could be a beautiful trade for like"
"6162120","6163040"," 80 points higher."
"6175050","6177470"," Let's look at this on the five minute trigger in the pivot."
"6177470","6178290"," This looks great. "
"6178530","6179650"," This is all very positive."
"6180430","6181670"," It's all looks beautiful."
"6182770","6185410"," And you can see the cross forming right here right now. "
"6186110","6189890"," You want to see this in a matter of fact if you watch this cross right here in the five"
"6189890","6190330"," minute chart."
"6194510","6195950"," As it begins to form."
"6197990","6202570"," You watch something like that and then you end up seeing price not not always but normally. "
"6203090","6204530"," So you have it right here right."
"6204530","6214330"," And you can with with ease as long as we stay above this white line with ease."

"7541140","7544600"," Vicks coming into support right now be very careful out there."
"7552870","7555910"," Remember this box down below this retest of lows."
"7557230","7562930"," The question becomes how soon do you think the Fed pauses or cuts rates. "
"7565790","7569070"," Now what they're pricing in today that they're they're cutting them."
"7570070","7574850"," There be it was priced in today that we would see cuts in this next FOMC meeting."
"7577870","7583090"," I would expect a pausing of rates personally at this FOMC meeting due to. "
"7583890","7586330"," I can't say that actually."
"7587270","7592670"," I'm saying that because my intent here or the implication here is."
"7592670","7598770"," Is the Fed being pushed into pausing rates or a pausing rate decision. "
"7599650","7601370"," By venture capitalists."
"7602590","7607950"," Is this actually I've heard talk of rumors of."
"7609390","7612090"," CEOs being involved in this as well. "
"7612630","7615210"," So this could be a strategic play by."
"7615210","7620350"," I see we'll brief the tech company heads to try to force the hand of the Fed."
"7623820","7626160"," Not a good look that could backfire. "
"7628100","7633260"," There's the other idea that they come out with one last rate hike right one last rate hike slam it"
"7633260","7633460"," in."
"7633940","7640620"," And break some more shit we see broken shit now right we know we're seeing some some cracking in"
"7640620","7641100"," the economy."
"7642040","7645640"," We're seeing some cracking in the housing market the auto market. "
"7645640","7648940"," We're seeing it in commercial real estate."
"7649480","7656800"," We're seeing it in layoffs that are bound to come out of what's had taken place in midsize and"
"7656800","7658500"," regional banks and VC banks."
"7659300","7663820"," People are getting their paychecks but as far as the poor progression of these companies. "
"7665000","7667300"," It's very very very bad right."
"7669640","7675640"," You're also talking about medium and large sized companies that are going to pause at this point."
"7676140","7679680"," That would be the expectations if you're a large company midsize company. "
"7680960","7685320"," You know I get apples not going to feel it but a lot of companies out there in the Dow"
"7685320","7685720"," Jones."
"7686340","7691880"," A lot of companies are going to take a second look at it at deploying money in any way shape"
"7691880","7693360"," or form in new ventures."
"7694140","7696000"," They're going to pull back and wait and hold. "
"7696720","7705160"," So my assumption is at this point they've broken something much larger than just a regional bank or"
"7705160","7706140"," a midsize bank."
"7706920","7716440"," They've caught the cause here or they've caused a more conservative approach to"
"7716440","7719000"," to companies."
"7719000","7728480"," So if I had to guess at this moment right now I would expect our rate pause at this next"
"7728480","7728900"," meeting. "
"7732180","7740370"," If you want to know Jason I would expect them to pause but its impact on the market."
"7742430","7751990"," Usually not good historically if they begin to pause rates we tend to find a market bottom a low in"
"7751990","7752390"," the market."
"7752390","7762050"," It will tend to roll over not every time like that trough we've been in. "
"7762050","7766170"," If you guys follow me on Captain's Alpha I'll try to bring it up right now."
"7768430","7770750"," Let me see if I can bring this up right now and show you this."
"7771870","7773530"," Give me just a second I'll bring this up. "
"7781120","7782880"," Try to find the post for you."

"7832270","7833250"," I got you covered."
"7856500","7861480"," So I made this post on February 3rd."
"7864180","7866040"," And at that time we were very bullish. "
"7867360","7871120"," And I said I'm like the company of every voice calling for limit down the last 13 months and old"
"7871120","7872540"," voice is rejoining us the top buyer."
"7873020","7878120"," Not a fan of either and both can cloud investor and trader force either resulting regurgitation and"
"7878120","7882060"," misunderstanding in the market makes this the most hated bull run of all time."
"7882060","7884660"," This is a bull run going back to October. "
"7885500","7890200"," Are we in a bull market a bull runners is just another bear rally likely a mix of the three"
"7890200","7895660"," for a bull market to return a few things need to happen one we need to 20% declines we"
"7895660","7896300"," got those."
"7898000","7902560"," We are we then need the trough and we're in the trough right now."
"7904140","7906760"," I can show this right here here's four twenty above. "
"7907920","7909960"," We got thirty four hundred below."
"7912060","7915360"," This is the current sideways training action that we have here in the market."
"7917120","7920680"," Twenty percent bull run from a recent bottom we got that too. "
"7921380","7924840"," That's in October we got nineteen point like nine eight percent."
"7926840","7931900"," We did get it doing a negative downtrend break yes we get a range break no."
"7932960","7937580"," That's the key is back from February we did not get a range a range break. "
"7939700","7945700"," We get our boy Mike Wilson here saying the final leg will be in Q one of twenty twenty three."
"7946780","7952880"," And we and I posted here we are looking for two things a possible last capitulation a break above"
"7952880","7956860"," and successful retest of new higher range and continued news hot new highs."
"7957300","7962380"," If we get a last capitulation is always better to hold equities as it was only last for brief"
"7962380","7962800"," moments. "
"7963340","7964400"," If you're a long."
"7967660","7970340"," So here's something important for you to watch here so."
"7971180","7975220"," This is a different this is the five hundred back in two thousand eight. "
"7975720","7977760"," This is that sideways."
"7978300","7979360"," You mute this for a minute."
"7982800","7985860"," So this is the sideways market that we're in right now. "
"7986860","7991960"," And what can happen is you can squeeze up higher and then we bloodbath it down."
"7992700","7994820"," We had this last capitulation phase."
"7997160","7999520"," And then we also have the break up from range here. "
"7999800","8004560"," This is where bulls were looking for when we were when we were trading for twenty ish."
"8005360","8007620"," And you're like hey is this over going to be the bull market."
"8008480","8013080"," But it always gets a retest as well you see the retest you break above it actually get a retest"
"8013080","8014380"," and we continue on higher. "
"8015300","8020740"," Now currently we're still in here we're still believe it or not we're still in this moment right"
"8020740","8021020"," here."
"8022480","8027220"," And we could easily trade down here right this would be like three forty five three sixty."
"8027800","8032620"," Squeeze up higher and then even bloodbath it down further than a three thousand down here. "
"8034160","8038340"," Historically when you're looking at the inverted yield curve when you're looking at."
"8041750","8045270"," Historically when you're looking then you're seeing volatility in the market right now right."
"8045790","8048850"," You're seeing wild and volatile moves hold on a second here. "
"8055960","8060700"," You're seeing wild and volatile moves in the stock market right now see if I can buy this here."
"8093550","8099290"," You're seeing wild volatility in the markets right now so even if you're asking will the fed pause"
"8099290","8100090"," or cut rates."
"8101090","8104390"," Historically on I'm going to show you that chart here in just a moment okay. "
"8105230","8108570"," I think I've showed it on Friday and I think I even showed it yesterday and Sunday."
"8109470","8112110"," If they front run the pausing of rates."
"8113770","8119710"," It can lead to some especially where unemployment is just starting to come up a little bit. "
"8120570","8127210"," You've got the potential pausing of rates right so there's going to be an attempt to front run a"
"8127210","8128350"," market bottom."
"8129210","8133970"," You've also got the inverted yield curve you also have inflation that's starting to come down."
"8134850","8142750"," It all leads to if you're it leads to this point where if you want to be a bull right"
"8142750","8144450"," and say okay can I buy this. "
"8145290","8149410"," It's above 420 and a retest above 420."
"8151610","8158250"," And what do you care so look at this from the perspective of being a bull over the next one"
"8158250","8159170"," to five years."
"8160130","8163770"," Five years three years five years some like three years let's call it. "
"8164090","8167290"," I'm going to be a bull for the next three years and trade safely."
"8168190","8171870"," The calmness of that feeling as a bull or a bear in that environment."
"8172770","8178830"," A bear can every every month right every month a bear can come in and sell this market pulls by"
"8178830","8180650"," that dip and it runs up for another month. "
"8180850","8182250"," It's very smooth sailing."
"8183250","8185750"," That lasts for a long long period of time."
"8185750","8191469"," So do you need to buy apple right now right here fuck no like tell no. "
"8192790","8195290"," You got a great three years ahead of you."
"8196450","8203990"," So the only thing you'd be doing is say staying in cash at this moment and waiting for a retest"
"8203990","8204889"," of say 420."
"8206350","8210150"," Or even 420 to 400 and then we move up higher from there. "
"8210150","8219290"," Otherwise right now we usually get this this exactly how this market is acting right at this moment"
"8219290","8223730"," today is acting like it's going to have a meltdown."
"8227570","8233070"," Trading like a penny stock right now for a reason and let's say the Fed does pause or cut rates."
"8233870","8238770"," There's a there's a very high probability of us rolling this market down to find one last bottom. "
"8238770","8248090"," And if anything just like yesterday we talked on this stream yesterday"
"8248090","8256990"," it's we're getting to a place to look for some kind of a ratio spread or a put back spread"
"8256990","8257670"," in the market."
"8257670","8260570"," So let's say we blast up to three ninety eight."
"8261190","8266570"," What's the move there put back spread guaranteed guaranteed guaranteed. "
"8268190","8274830"," Because it sure as shit looks like it sure as shit looks like pausing of rates sure as shit looks"
"8274830","8276330"," like we haven't seen bottom yet."
"8277690","8283110"," And if we trade higher a ratio spread will still pay you so if we launch off and start taking"
"8283110","8283930"," off from 400."
"8283930","8289070"," We go direct to 420 your your your ratio spread is paid for it's free. "
"8290150","8295870"," It's a free trade and if we roll over down there and we wake up one morning down 10 20%."
"8296490","8302510"," Two three days later we're not talking like three to five or ten days we're talking two three days"
"8302510","8303930"," down 10 20%."
"8305309","8308809"," Burr baby burr 500% trade automatic done. "
"8313090","8315129"," It looks like there's a pause coming."
"8316750","8317930"," It looks like it."
"8328240","8333760"," There's likely there's likely there's likely damage done. "
"8334680","8339620"," There you all have to see this from I want you to see this I want you to see like"
"8339620","8342000"," something in real real real life here."
"8343559","8350620"," There are humans that are CEOs of companies right now like the people that make the shit that you"
"8350620","8353240"," use real shit like."
"8353280","8358740"," I don't know like a tire or a car or. "
"8360540","8365660"," I don't know the oil that you put into it the batteries that you buy to charge a TV the"

"8368959","8375160"," The glassware that you drink out of the tables that you buy anything you name it but more"
"8375160","8377740"," specifically like real tangible things."
"8378559","8383280"," And I assure you that they panicked over this week guarantee guaranteed. "
"8384840","8390020"," And you've now broken my point here is that you've now broken companies."
"8391260","8394240"," There's now distrust in the institutions and banking."
"8394960","8398120"," There's now distrust from right down to mom and pop. "
"8399640","8401500"," Mary and Bill on Main Street."
"8403840","8405220"," Know that there's danger."
"8406120","8407580"," I'm assuring you of this. "
"8408200","8413680"," I'm assuring you that there are companies right now that know that there's likely we're in the"
"8413680","8416380"," trough and we're going to get that that last capitulation move down."
"8416540","8418600"," If that happens they don't want to risk exposure."
"8420560","8424600"," They don't mind jumping back in after the signs are all clear. "
"8425420","8427780"," So right now the market is in high risk."
"8428740","8429940"," These are real people."
"8430520","8437640"," Not what the Fed does not what the Treasury Secretary does is people don't care about what we're"
"8437640","8439060"," doing here in a live stream. "
"8440080","8443840"," These are movers and shakers of our markets and our economy."

"8460720","8461720"," the sidelines now."
"8462640","8467660"," That they actually want to see us trade 400 to 420 with a retest and we get a new bull"
"8467660","8473000"," market right now high risk with money out there for people."
"8473000","8476180"," Whether it's real or perceived it doesn't fucking matter. "
"8477040","8477920"," They don't care."
"8480320","8484400"," Now risk office is going to do the same thing they're going to they're going to they're going to"
"8484400","8488420"," they do this all the fucking they did not all the time they did every every five years three years"
"8488420","8489060"," ten years."
"8490000","8494520"," You just pull risk off the table and spy doesn't have to show the real price of the market either. "
"8495360","8500540"," The spy can be trading 400 right now today and not show the true price of spy."
"8503080","8507780"," You're not hearing companies roll it's just I don't even have them having this conversation so."
"8509520","8513720"," But there's real risk in the market right now at this moment next few weeks. "
"8514520","8529290"," And if you're"
"8529290","8535530"," looking at deploy cash in the market you're probably at home hoping we we we bled back down to"
"8535530","8535950"," 3000."
"8539640","8544740"," Or that you can buy a dip above let's say we scream up to 420 and you go damn I"
"8544740","8545600"," missed all that."
"8545600","8550940"," They'll likely be a retested 400 or 4000 within the next one to three months. "
"8553320","8555180"," Plenty of time to enter the market."
"8567480","8572800"," Yeah the uncertainty is is increasing dramatically I guarantee it I spoke to a guy this morning"
"8572800","8576840"," that had dinner with some of these people last night he said the same thing."
"8577640","8583340"," So they're rolling up shop large corporations rolling up shop right now exiting the market. "
"8586490","8590670"," No discussion on expansion or are no more expansion plans for these companies."
"8591290","8596890"," These companies are exiting exiting right now too much risk."
"8598890","8603850"," And I think I think I think or not think but I'm assuming that Jay Powell knows this. "
"8619120","8620720"," That's right Fernando I agree."
"8622620","8624100"," They'll front run a bottom."
"8626220","8630300"," If we're if they're going to cut rates we're going to get a market roll. "
"8635020","8636300"," I agree with you Fernando."
"8639080","8641720"," And the spy is fucking trading like a right now."
"8648400","8654300"," The spy right now is reminding me of every market role we've ever had. "
"8659020","8662820"," The funny part about just even today's action is I'm like man."
"8665580","8669160"," Some of the best some of the best trading is in this is in a crash."
"8670980","8678560"," To make some serious money on the call side like serious money in like 15 20 minutes an hour a"
"8678560","8679000"," day. "
"8679920","8683600"," Like I don't for a minute think that we can't go up 70 or 80 points today."
"8683600","8684320"," Like today."
"8685440","8686760"," If this is happening. "
"8688660","8689820"," Just straight up."
"8691100","8692520"," And then a violent reversal down."
"8695620","8696660"," If that happens. "
"8697860","8698620"," It'd be great."
"8698840","8698920"," Great."
"8699340","8700000"," We'll make a lot of money. "
"8727760","8729640"," You find the ones from the shit list."
"8731180","8736880"," Yeah the treasuries that they bought did you see that did you see the treasuries for that for these"
"8736880","8737540"," regional banks."
"8738920","8742560"," Once once they're once everybody knew it was like well fuck it. "
"8742560","8746580"," I'm not even paying you a dollar paying you 50 cents now on the dollar."
"8749600","8753260"," Now what if the increase rates will do this same thing."
"8753700","8754960"," The sideways trade. "
"8755600","8756920"," That's what we should be doing."
"8757360","8759240"," The post that I showed you just a moment ago."
"8760000","8762240"," Is a sideways trade until they cut rates. "
"8762920","8765400"," You go up down up down sideways T L T."
"8765820","8767640"," You can see it in T L T."
"8767900","8772600"," Up down sideways up down sideways and eventually T L T is going to rip face faces off."
"8773520","8774700"," At some point this year."
"8776580","8781540"," Which means the normal is this looks all normal to how we do it historically. "
"8802830","8806750"," Well I don't know they don't really get free money right if you're buying treasuries if you're"
"8806750","8808530"," buying treasuries before rate hikes."
"8809570","8815950"," Right and then you have to wait for maturity to get that money back and time passes right."
"8816430","8817970"," Are you really making money off that. "
"8842710","8844690"," I got some real walking is going on."
"8844810","8848850"," There we go."
"8858940","8862230"," Now we've looked we've looked this over I've looked this over. "
"8862990","8866290"," We've done I've done multiple shows on this."
"8867570","8873810"," Multiple multiple shows we've looked at every we've looked at the unemployment rates the two and"
"8873810","8874090"," ten."
"8874490","8877230"," We've looked at the fed funds rate inflation. "
"8877970","8883350"," We can go back historically and it's going down that there is one more low."
"8884150","8886430"," Like nine out of ten times."
"8888390","8892910"," You're not getting negative unemployment it's not going to happen we're at we're low unemployment. "
"8893510","8895950"," They can like show you every single time it happens."
"8898450","8900650"," You're saying this time is different."
"8901550","8902950"," There's no this time is different. "
"8903910","8905010"," If there is."
"8905890","8908930"," I don't know I can assure you that."
"8909430","8912530"," I can assure you that companies aren't doing this time is different. "
"8914010","8916350"," I'm going to show you that the companies are doing fuck no."
"8916790","8918390"," Every time we get a low on the market."
"8920450","8923930"," It's like this time was different might work for like I don't know. "
"8924230","8926010"," A $500 trade or something."
"8926790","8929390"," But with people with real money."
"8929530","8930930"," You don't want to hear it. "
"8931650","8933190"," They don't want to fucking hear it at all."
"8933470","8935050"," And they're not going to hear it."
"8936290","8937870"," Even if this time is different. "
"8938790","8941890"," They can wait to deploy money until after we go up and retest."
"8942850","8944110"," So there's no argument."
"8944790","8945290"," None. "
"8946110","8947210"," For this time is different."
"8947490","8947990"," There's zero."
"8949210","8952050"," Because even if we trade higher from here and never get a lower bottom. "
"8952630","8955670"," You're still going to come back and retest that four twenty four hundred."
"8957190","8958070"," Risk free."
"8958710","8959070"," Retest. "
"8959570","8960910"," And take it from there."
"8961490","8966210"," So like any kind of argument like yeah this is it like it's it's bullshit."
"8966410","8967130"," It means nothing. "
"8967870","8969310"," That bears no relevance."
"8973380","8975760"," None because you can enter risk free above."
"8976440","8980760"," You just you enter risk free and like June or July on a retest. "
"8980860","8983600"," We trade it now from now into June or July."
"8983760","8985040"," Let's say trade it like four forty."
"8986400","8989380"," It would still come back to retest four twenty or four hundred. "
"8991630","8993990"," So you get risk free."
"8997240","8999320"," There's like there's no real argument here for."
"9001980","9005740"," The only argument for a bull here is the same as before. "
"9006460","9010740"," If you bought thirty four hundred thirty four fifty if you bought thirty four fifty in October."
"9011740","9015740"," You can either take profit up here or could have taken profit up here or you can hedge your"
"9015740","9018100"," position up here with a nice fat hedge."
"9019400","9022420"," Or you can wait to add until a retest above four twenty. "
"9022760","9023320"," Does it make sense."
"9023900","9024700"," So like you're buying the dips."
"9025820","9026960"," You buy thirty four hundred. "
"9027500","9030140"," You have an expectation to possibly buy three thousand."
"9034020","9034840"," Second or third."
"9035020","9036380"," If you have one more bloodbath. "
"9036580","9039120"," Let's say you bought thirty four hundred and you buy thirty two or twenty eight."
"9039340","9040740"," You DC a that and you're good to go."
"9041620","9044760"," But up here for anyone long from October you're just hedging. "
"9046060","9049800"," And waiting to get above four hundred or four twenty with a retest that holds."
"9050740","9052780"," Otherwise you're just buying big fat dips."
"9054160","9055480"," Or taking profit here. "
"9056920","9058540"," Or at when we were at four twenty."
"9060080","9063540"," It's kind of like no man's land right now for an investor."
"9064440","9066540"," Is right here right here is a no man's land. "
"9067280","9068300"," For an investor."
"9069760","9075820"," You're either buying a market low or you're buying a retest above in this bull market trend."
"9080100","9083080"," And this isn't trading today healthy at all. "
"9085890","9087390"," None of this is healthy right here."
"9089870","9091470"," And further to that point."
"9091470","9096890"," The grinding down of support from October or December currently. "
"9099030","9101350"," We're going to come back down and try to revisit this right."
"9101590","9105950"," Bears are going to try to sell above from above here and grind down any of this support."
"9106410","9107730"," To get us down into October. "
"9114150","9117470"," Let's take a look at the five minute and see if we get some nice consolidation going on."
"9118570","9119590"," Looking like it."
"9121310","9123050"," Almost the perfect touch right here. "
"9132460","9134040"," We've got some calls here now."
"9135980","9138360"," See that touch right here in this five minute bar."
"9146040","9148880"," See if we can squeeze up above this hourly trigger. "
"9153180","9155300"," Price on VIX trading below it's one minute."
"9165320","9167580"," See if we can break through this hourly here."
"9172580","9175500"," If this doesn't reject here there could be a rejection. "
"9175920","9178360"," I want you to realize that sellers."
"9183620","9184660"," Can't cut here."
"9187020","9189100"," Holy fucking shit. "
"9190720","9199300"," I just sold a 181."
"9223870","9227570"," 390 C's just went from like a dollar fucking 40 to 180."
"9229050","9230710"," In like a moment here. "
"9236500","9238180"," See if I can grab this again."
"9238180","9238680"," Hold on."
"9239520","9242980"," I think I might just put these on and fucking just leave them for the day. "
"9245020","9248060"," I'm starting to smash through the hourly trigger."
"9248320","9249680"," Be careful of a reversal here."
"9250940","9252920"," The safety trade here is above. "
"9254680","9258460"," The safety trade is once we get above a consolidation move to go higher."
"9263740","9265300"," Traded 390 39."
"9268160","9270720"," Yeah, that's bullish is all fuck right there, isn't it?"
"9277520","9280620"," 24 96 on VIX you're looking for to break. "
"9286520","9288320"," Any kind of holding above."
"9288680","9290840"," If we hold above, I'll give you a hold above number."
"9301740","9305840"," Hold above 389 89 somewhere that we're somewhere in here. "
"9306020","9309200"," If we hold above this green bar right here, we can hold above it."
"9310680","9311900"," We're going to go to 389."
"9314820","9316900"," I mean, sorry, not 390, 398. "
"9320210","9322090"," 398 if we can get above right here."
"9325030","9327890"," Sellers are definitely here, but we will squeeze straight up."
"9336590","9339930"," We could see volatility a blast down. "
"9340130","9340750"," Be very careful."
"9340930","9341850"," It's very dangerous here."
"9354490","9359210"," You want to be long above the green bar, but not caught in this here. "
"9360130","9362410"," This can get very violent, very fast."
"9362730","9365470"," We can see we can see big giant red bars come up."
"9368110","9370070"," Just be very careful in here. "
"9370990","9372110"," Very careful."
"9372290","9373350"," Swift reversal time."
"9375170","9376290"," That was a nice trade. "
"9377590","9379570"," Now it's fast as fuck right there."
"9415040","9417200"," Yeah, I'd like to see a squeeze up to 398."
"9417660","9420060"," I'd like to put a ratio spread on up there. "
"9426630","9429290"," Let me show you what the market is looking like right now."
"9430870","9432770"," We're going to go through the entire market here."
"9432870","9433910"," It's only 12 o'clock too. "
"9434490","9435090"," It's early."
"9458340","9460160"," So those sellers are right up there."
"9460920","9463440"," And there's another group of sellers right here. "
"9464280","9466820"," These are the two main drivers of the market right now."
"9466820","9469620"," The yellow and the red."
"9471360","9472380"," Two main drivers. "
"9473320","9474840"," We have teed off of this."
"9476160","9478480"," And teed off of it and teed off of it."
"9479340","9481980"," See it right here, teed off it, teed off it again. "
"9489380","9491080"," Fools want to be able to at least come up here."
"9491320","9493780"," Bears want to want to sell a 398."
"9498240","9502460"," Sellers are very aggressive right now just selling off this hourly trigger. "
"9506890","9509390"," So there's no real safe trade here for a bull."
"9511050","9512710"," Unless price can get above."
"9513070","9514050"," So if price can get above. "
"9514750","9517170"," And hold on the one in the five minute come up."
"9517350","9519070"," Create a three trigger combination and boom."
"9519250","9521630"," We're up there trading 398 like it's nothing. "
"9521990","9523150"," That's how fast that happens."
"9526810","9531570"," Now the VIX is coming into some kind of support."
"9533330","9541220"," You can see it's being supportive right here. "
"9542180","9547000"," If you see the VIX come start trade higher and try to test this double bottom above."
"9550230","9551170"," Sorry about that."
"9551270","9558310"," If the VIX finds support and squeezes up. "
"9559210","9562570"," You could see a new low on the spot S&P 500 ES."
"9563690","9568590"," You really want to see price break below 25 bucks for that trip higher."
"9578870","9583550"," That's where you see this down below a point here being that you would see something like a move"
"9583550","9587070"," here and then swift reversal and then you get your real move right there. "
"9597370","9599450"," If price holds above the hourly trigger."
"9599930","9600750"," It's a nice long."
"9638430","9642050"," 398 currently or so 398 for today. "
"9642950","9644250"," Our four cents."
"9648100","9653040"," They've got us the dealers have us saying we'll be able to hit three for 94."
"9653420","9657200"," I guess you have 30 cents on 394 22 cents on 395. "
"9667440","9671040"," Tomorrow 400 C's are 60 cents."
"9680270","9682390"," And probably be a 300% trade."
"9683090","9735440"," Give me just"
"9735440","9735920"," five minutes. "
"9736060","9736680"," I'm going to take a quick break."
"9736860","9737360"," Grab some coffee."
"9738560","9741840"," Stream will stay on of course and they get the juice on the background. "
"9742780","9745640"," We put some I'll put some news on for you in the background."
"9746120","9775520"," I think it's"
"9775520","9777720"," a music or some news for you."
"9793470","9796830"," Is slightly higher and then they began cutting rates in 1995. "
"9797490","9801690"," The peak in yields occurred with that orange County bankruptcy moment."
"9801690","9805890"," So over the course of 13 months seven rate hikes 300 basis points."
"9805890","9807030"," That's the model. "
"9807150","9809090"," The Chairman Powell should be looking at 1994."
"9809470","9810910"," This is eerily similar."
"9811390","9813130"," And I think we're going to have the same type of impact. "
"9813470","9817890"," So Bryn Goldman's Jan Hazzia says in light of all of this."
"9818770","9822890"," We no longer expect the Fed to deliver a rate hike at its meeting on March 22nd."
"9824010","9825370"," Is that how you think as well?"
"9827790","9829510"," I think that has to be on the table. "
"9829730","9832630"," I think Josh and Joe walked walked us through history really well."
"9832630","9836050"," And I think that something clearly has broken."
"9836350","9839330"," And it's not really put back together right now. "
"9839430","9840530"," Right now everyone's calm."
"9840950","9843150"," Clearly the markets saying rates are going lower."
"9843390","9844550"," We just five minutes to be right back. "
"9845330","9849650"," And I also think that the inflation numbers that come out this week, the market will totally"
"9849650","9851610"," dismiss them because they'll say those are old."
"9851930","9854830"," Those were before last Thursday and going forward."
"9855270","9856790"," This is very deflationary. "
"9857270","9859310"," And so but I don't think we're out of the woods though."
"9859310","9864390"," And so if I think about positioning Scott, you know, while the big banks will clearly be recipients"
"9864390","9870830"," of those deposits, if many deposits, it's like banks are highly, highly sensitive to really small"
"9870830","9871110"," changes."
"9871110","9872970"," Yeah, TLT is a nice trade right now. "
"9873230","9875050"," I like the idea of TLT trade button."
"9875250","9880650"," Because if you didn't know where your money was and what cash vehicle it was on Thursday, you sure"
"9880650","9881610"," as heck know today."
"9882290","9886470"," And you know, JP Morgan and their fourth quarter earnings put together a really good piece that"
"9886470","9889910"," showed in JP Morgan's balance sheet for every one basis point. "
"9890250","9892850"," One basis point rise in deposit rate."
"9893310","9897250"," Scott, that's 250 million in net interest expense."
"9897890","9899530"," And so I think you still have this bus. "
"9899790","9902150"," You could drive through bank deposits to what money markets."
"9902630","9905550"," And I still think that's really the weakness that will come through in financials."
"9906050","9910490"," Therefore, S&P earnings is that people are going to be moving their money out of bank deposits into"
"9910490","9911970"," treasuries and money markets. "
"9912430","9917510"," So I still think earnings are still too high because financial earnings have to come down because"
"9917510","9918570"," of this event that happened."
"9919010","9921810"," Sure, you know, you raise the rate on deposits."
"9921910","9925290"," Obviously, as you say, it changes net interest margin. "
"9926250","9929750"," One of, if not the most important metric when we're thinking about bank profitability."
"9930130","9935210"," And we're assessing what all of this means going forward for how we should view bank stocks."
"9936130","9940310"," There's a lot of collateral damage just within stock prices alone. "
"9940850","9946870"," I bring up, you know, what Charles Schwab and that stock price has been doing today."
"9947350","9948650"," Which is down nearly 10%."
"9949310","9953470"," I bring it up because Josh Brown, you bought Charles Schwab today. "
"9954230","9954790"," I did."
"9955070","9960910"," Some of the best trades I ever made were in the midst of a crisis where they just start"
"9960910","9964990"," indiscriminately hitting stocks that are not going to go down as a result of that crisis."
"9964990","9971470"," And a really great example is like 12 years ago with the European contagion fears in late 2011. "
"9971750","9973290"," Bank of America went six bucks."
"9973790","9975390"," Like Morgan Stanley was single bit."
"9975610","9979270"," People forget it was like an echo crisis of 2008. "
"9979710","9982130"," We did it all over again in 2010, 2011."
"9982950","9985870"," And you had a lot of, I would call them generational opportunities."
"9986450","9987370"," Schwab could go lower. "
"9987890","9989030"," I don't think it needs to."
"9989350","9993810"," I think we can probably see some of the panic come out of that name."
"9993810","9995170"," They put out an activity report. "
"9995650","9997050"," More than 80%."
"9997050","10002250"," This is important for every viewer who's got money, custody that Schwab with an advisor, our firm,"
"10002410","10003550"," custody's with Schwab, for example."
"10004130","10005930"," I think it's probably 60 or 70% of the industry. "
"10006390","10012090"," 80% of Schwab's total bank deposits fell within the FDIC's insurance limits."
"10012510","10018990"," That puts Schwab among the five highest ratios of the top 100 banks in the entire country."
"10018990","10025350"," So if you think this is systemically risky for Schwab, then really nobody's safe if they're in that"
"10025350","10025930"," top five. "
"10026450","10027830"," But I don't think that's the case."
"10028170","10030990"," So today was a huge under overreaction in Schwab."
"10031230","10034010"," I think the stock is down double digits multiple days in a row. "
"10034430","10036230"," It's been cut in half almost this year."
"10036790","10039170"," I stepped in, took position in the high 40s."
"10039610","10041270"," I don't know if it's a trade or an investment. "
"10041950","10044170"," I just know overreaction when I see it."
"10044410","10046190"," And I decided to try to make some money here."
"10046190","10050450"," We'll see if I'm right, you know, the day is not over yet. "
"10050650","10053290"," But I do this all the time in markets like this."
"10054570","10058190"," Hopefully this will have a similar outcome where cooler heads will prevail."
"10058190","10063590"," And you don't sound like you're looking to be necessarily a renter, so to speak, that this is one"
"10063590","10063850"," of those. "
"10064050","10069610"," As you put it, perhaps, generational opportunity type things that you look at."
"10069790","10072610"," If I'm up 10 sticks by the clothes, I might just say all right, good enough."
"10072950","10074910"," Keep in mind, I have exposure to Schwab. "
"10074910","10077150"," They're one of my most important business partners."
"10077370","10081290"," We cost the hour of client assets at TD, at Schwab."
"10081570","10082050"," They've merged. "
"10082770","10084490"," I think Schwab is okay."
"10085090","10086030"," I don't know about the equity."
"10086410","10087230"," I'm talking about the entity. "
"10087810","10089330"," And right now, that's really important."
"10089750","10092690"," So I want to get to our headliner, Brad Gerstner, in just a moment."
"10092910","10098930"," But Joe, just give me a comment on how you're thinking about the banks, teeing off of what Bryn"
"10098930","10105710"," said as to whether the investor paradigm has to change because you think there are going to be some"
"10105710","10110110"," changes in the mechanics around net interest margin and things like that. "
"10110270","10113850"," Mike Mayo on JP Morgan upgrades it to overweight, says Goliath is winning."
"10114990","10120750"," If this episode doesn't sort of tell you where the money, some of the more worrisome, so to speak,"
"10120930","10125630"," money has flowed over the last handful of days, then nothing will."
"10125770","10126490"," So he upgrades it. "
"10126550","10128030"," But give me your quick thought before we bring in Brad."
"10128390","10130810"," The simplest outcome is usually the correct one."
"10131470","10133010"," Think about this logically for one second. "
"10133010","10139730"," What offers relief to all of the banks that are holding treasuries on their balance sheets in terms"
"10139730","10140150"," of assets?"
"10140550","10145550"," What offers relief is exactly what's happened in the last three days, where treasury yields move"
"10145550","10145850"," lower."
"10146330","10151510"," So as the Federal Reserve really going to obstruct the process of, on one hand, on a Sunday"
"10151510","10156330"," evening, announce that they're going to provide the root necessary relief to the tension and stress"
"10156330","10157790"," that the banks are feeling."
"10157790","10162870"," And then on the other hand, at a Federal Reserve meeting come out in a press conference and talk"
"10162870","10167030"," about the need to continue utilizing extreme measures to combat inflation. "
"10167570","10168750"," There's no logic behind that."
"10168890","10175610"," The simple explanation is no reserve is going to continue to allow the relief be offered in the"
"10175610","10176470"," form of lower yield."
"10176690","10180770"," Imagine a Fed press conference where in the first ten minutes he talks about, there might need to"
"10180770","10181310"," be some pain. "
"10181910","10185110"," And then the second half of his comments is like, oh, and by the way, this week we're going to"
"10185110","10189910"," rescue this one, that one, this one in California, it's just not the way things are going to go."
"10190090","10194950"," You have to use common sense here, not spreadsheets, to understand the situation we're in."
"10195090","10196290"," All right, let's bring in our headliner. "
"10196810","10197710"," He's Brad Gerstner."
"10197870","10200850"," He is the founder and CEO of Altimeter Capital."
"10201450","10202930"," Join us in an exclusive interview. "
"10203430","10204770"," Brad, it's good to see you."
"10205890","10210830"," You know, you're probably certainly one of the most prominent voices from an investor base that"
"10210830","10212390"," comes on from that part of the world."
"10212410","10215390"," You have venture activity aside from everything else that you do. "
"10215390","10218730"," Can you just give me your thoughts on all that's transpired here?"
"10219670","10220430"," Meeting some."
"10221490","10224830"," The first thing I would say is it's just been an emotional weekend."
"10226450","10235250"," You know, I heard from hundreds of entrepreneurs, from schools, from little leagues. "
"10235450","10236110"," Feed some nuts."
"10237210","10241090"," That they had done something wrong, that they weren't going to get access to their money."
"10241650","10243430"," They weren't going to be able to meet payroll. "
"10244110","10248670"," They weren't going to be able to, you know, meet the needs of the kids they had committed to."
"10249410","10253330"," And so, you know, I was proud to see a community rally together."
"10254110","10257090"," I know, you know, I'm from a small town in Indiana. "
"10258010","10259850"," I know Silicon Valley is not love."
"10260370","10267990"," I know that Silicon Valley doesn't always do what's in their own best interest in terms of"
"10267990","10268390"," communicating."
"10268390","10275830"," But I will tell you that what happened here this weekend in saving, you know, and pushing to save,"
"10275830","10281070"," you know, these businesses stepping up with no interest loans to help people make payroll today,"
"10281070","10283270"," like our firm and so many others were doing. "
"10284350","10290470"," That is the exact same thing that was going to happen today across this country from Maine to"
"10290470","10295470"," Hawaii, including small banks in Indiana and Florida."
"10295470","10297830"," If the Fed had not stepped up."
"10298190","10304810"," The one thing we know for sure now, this was not, this is not a weekend about Silicon Valley Bank. "
"10305530","10310910"," This is really a story of an entire regional banking system that was in peril."
"10311790","10314690"," And the Canary and the coal mine may have been Silicon Valley Bank."
"10315250","10319910"," And we're going to investigate, there's going to be plenty of things that all of these banks get"
"10319910","10320250"," wrong. "
"10320250","10329250"," But this parabolic move in rates, right, really dismantled the hold the maturity portfolios of"
"10329250","10329730"," these banks."
"10330490","10333310"," It was exposed that they were under capitalized."
"10333770","10337790"," And I think if you look today, obviously a lot of these banks stocks are down. "
"10338290","10344690"," And I've had people text me and tweet me that, you know, seeing we told you this, you know, this"
"10344690","10346430"," isn't going to stop the contagion."
"10346430","10352970"," To me, the stocks being down shows the perfect balance that our government struck here."
"10353270","10355050"," You know, we often criticize our government. "
"10355650","10362690"," But over the weekend, we had the executive branch led by the president, the FDIC, the Fed, the"
"10362690","10369230"," treasury rallied together and find a balance in the middle, a roadmap forward that averted what I"
"10369230","10373870"," believe would have been an O8 type moment, you know, coast to coast this morning."
"10373870","10380210"," And what they said is wipe out the stocks, wipe out the bonds, not a single dollar of taxpayer"
"10380210","10382090"," money going to any executive."
"10382630","10386930"," In fact, we're going to go find the dollars that they sold in stocks in recent weeks. "
"10387450","10387690"," Okay."
"10388090","10393050"," But what we're going to do is we're going to give the confidence to the system that their deposits"
"10393050","10393670"," are safe."
"10394330","10398010"," Whether you're at Signature Bank, which got closed down in New York. "
"10398570","10399750"," For anyone curious."
"10402030","10402770"," I did."
"10402990","10404590"," Would you say here you wrote a."
"10406030","10408210"," Yes, I did smoke a pork shoulder yesterday. "
"10408230","10409110"," Hell, yes."
"10409430","10412430"," I don't think this is the last one."
"10412930","10414690"," We have to work through this problem. "
"10414690","10415870"," And now we have a roadmap."
"10416370","10417750"," What have I told you that rally?"
"10418930","10420450"," Confidence to depositor."
"10420810","10426950"," Not to the CEOs, not to the stockholders, but to the depositors that you did nothing wrong. "
"10426950","10428310"," Am I still bullish here?"
"10428410","10428950"," I am."
"10430550","10435910"," So there's obviously a lot in what you just said, and I want to go to a number of different"
"10435910","10438870"," places within what you just told me."
"10439810","10441590"," Yeah, this guy is talking in the background. "
"10441950","10443390"," I don't believe anything he's saying either."
"10445250","10454770"," I don't believe anything that's coming out of his mouth right now."
"10454770","10456650"," Yeah, I don't believe anything they're saying. "
"10456650","10463590"," A while is argued that governments should get out of our way and let us innovate and let our"
"10463590","10465810"," companies grow and we don't bail people out."
"10467010","10473270"," And now it seems like the venture community was the loudest on the digital rooftops, so to speak,"
"10474010","10479950"," screaming for help when it didn't seem to be as concerned about that in past instances."
"10480210","10481290"," And how would you square that?"
"10482270","10488610"," First, I would say, you know, this debate around federalism, limited government versus a government"
"10488610","10491050"," being involved is as old as the republic itself. "
"10491650","10494210"," I mean, the debates over the federalist papers, et cetera."
"10494270","10500290"," And so, yes, I do think Silicon Valley and so I'm going to give you a warning here."
"10500450","10500630"," Okay. "
"10504010","10506070"," I'm going to give you a warning here real quick."
"10506470","10512970"," So on a one minute chart, we're getting a bearish cross right now."
"10514490","10517490"," I want you to look at this white line right here. "
"10517590","10517730"," Okay."
"10520010","10521890"," Just warning to you warning."
"10533100","10535460"," Price begins to break below here. "
"10537520","10539500"," And hold and start to retest."
"10539500","10541240"," We will see some lows coming up."
"10541440","10541540"," Okay. "
"10542120","10543140"," Just a warning out there."
"10543260","10550460"," If you are long that we are having a bearish cross over forming currently at the moment on the one"
"10550460","10550880"," minute chart."
"10551720","10553160"," We're going to look at the five minute chart real quick. "
"10556020","10558540"," How deep that is at this moment."
"10558620","10559060"," We don't know."
"10559200","10560280"," We'll see how it forms up. "
"10560540","10561780"," You could end up seeing a trade."
"10561780","10563860"," See if I can put this on here for you."
"10570940","10571980"," Something like that. "
"10583410","10586070"," Just watching this right now, starting to form."
"10586350","10587230"," You'll see it on the one minute."
"10587970","10588730"," Easy to see. "
"10594590","10595710"," Right down in here."
"10596450","10597850"," You don't want to see price get underneath."
"10598230","10601050"," It's up now 12, 23, seven minutes left for bulls. "
"10603170","10606230"," To get a new high right now."
"10606430","10608450"," So you can see the previous high right here."
"10609230","10612730"," Three ninety thirty nine goals have seven minutes left. "
"10613690","10616130"," If they don't get this new high in the next seven minutes."
"10616790","10619430"," You will see the market attempt to roll lower."
"10627560","10631180"," Targets below include three eighty seven forty eight three eighty six fifty one. "
"10632280","10634620"," And then a retest of the lows from earlier today."
"10647390","10649170"," Just saved us from ourselves."
"10650030","10650270"," Right. "
"10650550","10653230"," Save those airline employees and they did the right thing."
"10653690","10657310"," Yes, we have a diversity of opinions in this country."
"10657830","10659150"," It's what makes us great. "
"10659910","10663170"," Chamath is my friend, but I'm happy to bait him on any subject."
"10663850","10664310"," And we do."
"10665350","10670710"," You know, there's a lot of criticism about, you know, you know, the voices that came out of here"
"10670710","10671330"," over the weekend. "
"10671850","10673990"," I'm not trying to stifle any of that criticism."
"10674590","10675830"," Let's all have the debate."
"10676050","10676930"," Let's have it in open. "
"10677770","10681150"," But, you know, to say that everybody in Silicon Valley."
"10681730","10684470"," Can you guys hear the speaker in the background of this podcast?"
"10684750","10687190"," Can you guys actually hear them talking to the background?"
"10687370","10691390"," The government's, you know, policies that went all in."
"10692210","10695010"," You guys all hear the broadcast in the background. "
"10695250","10696470"," I'm not saying that."
"10696530","10696990"," It's a little quiet."
"10697450","10699950"," And respectfully, Brad, I didn't say all. "
"10700730","10702110"," I certainly didn't."
"10702350","10709170"," I used the Chamath example as one of the loudest voices from your world in that very moment."
"10709170","10713570"," And there's a reason that that went viral at the time. "
"10713710","10713730"," Okay."
"10713730","10720750"," And it just put forward the debate over when it's quote unquote right or okay to rescue."
"10721010","10721450"," Is that better?"
"10721870","10725990"," And when it's not, who should be rescued and who shouldn't?"
"10726150","10728770"," Can you hear my voice and hear his voice just fine or no?"
"10729010","10733250"," I haven't put a quieter on that source. "
"10733250","10734390"," I'll try to do that tomorrow."
"10734390","10735690"," I'll have this up for you every day."
"10735690","10737930"," Plenty of discussion and debate out here over the weekend. "
"10737930","10740690"," And I'm certain if he and."
"10740870","10743370"," There's a condenser I can put on that was quiet."
"10743370","10744350"," Their voice when I speak. "
"10744630","10746630"," CEOs did not deserve to get bailed out."
"10746930","10749470"," The stocks did not deserve to get bailed out."
"10749550","10750190"," My trade is by. "
"10750410","10752910"," I've got a crash protection on right now."
"10753170","10754710"," Just dirty stanky puts."
"10755030","10756330"," Not deserve to get bailed out. "
"10756610","10758990"," And I'm looking to buy a dip down below here if we can."
"10759290","10760890"," We're the innocent depositors."
"10761190","10763430"," All they did, the only risk that they took. "
"10763430","10765010"," Two trades today."
"10765110","10766010"," Two big trades today."
"10766330","10767690"," Both printed just fine. "
"10767890","10768730"," The citizens bank."
"10769130","10770030"," The PNC bank."
"10770490","10771530"," The first Republic bank. "

"10973070","10973950"," I don't know why."
"10974030","10975770"," And I worked my ass off all weekend. "
"10976310","10977290"," Like everybody else did."
"10977530","10978890"," So I'll go back and check that again today."
"10979010","10980490"," It doesn't go down in flames. "
"10981070","10982810"," It was a very perilous weekend."
"10984390","10985570"," So what happens now?"
"10985570","10989670"," For the, you know, the younger investors, the younger startup."
"10990490","10991910"," Founders who were trying to get the. "
"10991970","10993350"," One of them that I tried was a new one."
"10993350","10994990"," You were trying to get back in the day."
"10995590","10998590"," You just had the prime source of that funding. "

"11003070","11004510"," One of them is a real estate LLC. "
"11005270","11006410"," Funding for the kind of."
"11006410","11010290"," I tried to try to use real estate LLC and that didn't work."
"11010410","11011030"," The moment stop. "
"11011770","11011990"," Right."
"11012230","11013430"," This is the irony of the moment."
"11013970","11014990"," Silicon Valley. "
"11015270","11015750"," The start."
"11015850","11017930"," I tried a new LLC that we just started for the."
"11018150","11019610"," It's not just a Silicon Valley story. "
"11019930","11021410"," And frankly, it's a global story."
"11021930","11023430"," Check in and find out why."
"11023530","11026410"," One of the most interesting periods of technological innovation. "
"11027010","11030890"," Around augmented and artificial intelligence of my career."
"11031650","11033710"," We, I just hosted a dinner last Thursday."
"11034430","11040810"," The night all this news was breaking with with 15 incredible young entrepreneurs who are founding"
"11040810","11041250"," companies. "
"11041250","11042050"," Right."
"11042230","11042930"," With two major."
"11043210","11043690"," Well, I did. "
"11043730","11047350"," So the new LLC I'm waiting on an EIN for that one in America."
"11047630","11051550"," It's going to be made better by what is going by this level of innovation."
"11052030","11053550"," But remember the world. "
"11054210","11055290"," Crashed in 2000."
"11055450","11056610"," You may have sent me an email."
"11056650","11057270"," I'll check right now. "
"11057290","11060650"," And all the Internet changed all our lives and made us more resilient."
"11061290","11066770"," We crashed again in 2008 right at the birth of mobile and birth of cloud computing that it again"
"11066770","11071330"," allowed us to order our food supply in the middle of the pandemic with the with the push of a"
"11071330","11071570"," button."
"11071830","11072890"," And here we are again. "
"11073210","11075750"," We have a major reset that's occurring in the world."
"11076030","11077070"," This wasn't a problem."
"11077070","11078070"," Yeah, they haven't sent me anything. "
"11078070","11079150"," So I don't know why."
"11079350","11082430"," It's weird is that I think I've had to set up a few of the tax things."
"11082690","11085250"," Oh, maybe I have to maybe I've changed both now. "
"11085590","11087070"," That's why thinking problem."
"11088070","11089190"," I think I do."
"11089410","11091410"," And I want to get to that. "
"11091470","11092950"," I want to talk about CPI where we're having."
"11092950","11095290"," I think now I have two different companies listed."
"11095290","11097090"," My hands in the air. "
"11097290","11099050"," I want founders to come in here today."
"11099590","11100970"," I'm excited to back them."
"11101130","11102050"," We have money in the bank. "
"11102250","11103330"," We can access the money."
"11103610","11104970"," There's no loss of enthusiasm."
"11106450","11106550"," Right. "
"11106830","11111390"," To back the world's founders who are creating creating this amazing future."
"11112050","11117150"," But we just didn't want to be set back by something that frankly was much bigger than Silicon"
"11117150","11117990"," Valley's bank."
"11118330","11120070"," It was the entire banking system. "
"11121210","11128870"," So given the enormity and the scale of what we just went through and hopefully don't continue to go"
"11128870","11133110"," through, we just don't know where this goes necessarily from here."
"11133270","11137850"," But what do you think it means for the markets and for the Fed moving forward?"
"11138050","11141150"," Does the Fed pause in a week?"
"11141790","11142750"," Give me your thoughts as well."
"11142930","11143870"," We'll pivot to the market conversation. "
"11144990","11145170"," Great."
"11145990","11148090"," Well, I really think Joe."
"11148090","11151070"," So I just want to give you some warning out there currently. "
"11151450","11151690"," Okay."
"11152130","11154210"," I'll give you a quick warning on the market right now."
"11154210","11155390"," We are starting to bleed off. "
"11155630","11158630"," We're trading below the one minute and now the five minute."
"11161930","11164570"," Rejection off the hourly trigger like we did this morning."
"11164830","11166430"," Could see some blood in the market. "
"11172970","11175310"," Vic's still not showing us the way forward here."
"11175490","11176790"," Vic's needs to trade above."
"11179570","11180010"," 2694. "
"11182950","11186270"," Looks like the hourly on VIX is holding up."
"11186730","11188690"," So I'm going to show you both VIX and SPY."
"11192380","11197060"," And you can, this is the VIX right here and you can see it holding on the hourly needs to"
"11197060","11197780"," trade above. "
"11200340","11200780"," 2694."
"11202040","11204360"," That would signal a big move lower."
"11204520","11208660"," I know SPY is rolling over right now, but it's still not showing the bigger move down. "
"11209600","11212680"," This is the SPY right here and you can see the rejection off the hourly."
"11213180","11215940"," Each time we have rejected off this, we have traded lower."
"11216600","11219960"," It's still not showing itself on the SPY just or on VIX just yet. "
"11221000","11223100"," We'll get that confirmation here in just a few moments."
"11223680","11230640"," As long as SPY is trading under 3801, 3801 it remains bearish."
"11234300","11244130"," So 3801 right here, right with that yellow bar, that red bar is"
"11244130","11244490"," right there. "
"11244490","11249990"," There's a traders add to ECB bets and see 50% odds of 50 basis point high come Thursday."
"11267190","11268290"," They want me to buy."
"11268850","11274210"," I'm looking at a $387 there, $1.76 for zero dates in the money. "
"11274350","11275870"," I'm like, hit the fuck out of here."
"11278650","11285430"," Another $1.90. Another $1.90. There are $1.76. I'm like, no, thanks."
"11293760","11304600"," In the money zero dates for one strikeout zero dates, $1.73. They're"
"11304600","11305720"," all over the place right now. "
"11305840","11307780"," They're trading like 190, 170."
"11310480","11311780"," Bouncing back and forth."
"11312600","11313240"," I'm interested. "
"11314220","11315040"," I want to buy this."
"11317460","11322140"," But I don't like how the SPY is looking on the triggers right now."
"11326580","11327100"," Henry?"
"11328300","11329140"," Hey, what's up?"
"11329940","11330600"," Thank you. "
"11332720","11333700"," Thanks for the water."
"11334880","11337080"," Sweet, get some water, get some coffee."
"11338120","11339460"," I got some pictures for you guys. "
"11340060","11341180"," I got some cool pictures."
"11341520","11344500"," I got pictures for Joe Daudet, knee trading shorts, a bunch of people."
"11344860","11347420"," I'm just going to break those out real quick and put them up on the stream. "
"11349360","11353000"," Let me see what I can do to get these up on stream today for another day."
"11357790","11359490"," Let me see what I can do here."
"11360490","11362470"," See if I can get something going here for you guys. "
"11363090","11364390"," Turn the volume back up."
"11366050","11369800"," Case of all that, which we don't know."
"11370700","11376380"," Ask those questions and appropriately and conservatively say, are there places where we can"
"11376380","11381920"," increase the size of our exposure, knowing that this probably isn't the last 3,786. "
"11382700","11384380"," Somewhere up in here, we need to get above."
"11384660","11387360"," You get above that red box right there."
"11387540","11390740"," I think it's good that the Fed has given us a road. "
"11390880","11392000"," This red box right here."
"11392120","11393260"," Need to get above this bread box."
"11393260","11397460"," We'll wipe out the executives pay, but we'll protect the depositors. "
"11397980","11398720"," That's good to know."
"11398980","11401060"," I think that sets up a good precedent."
"11401920","11406120"," But I said yesterday on Twitter, we're a long, long way for being out of the woods. "
"11406560","11412540"," The only thing we accomplished last night is making sure that millions of people weren't lining up"
"11412540","11414220"," at their small hometown banks today."
"11414940","11418260"," I talked to my mother last night, 85 years old in Florida."
"11418920","11420820"," Big community down there. "
"11420820","11424820"," And my sister and my mom were asking me, you know, is our bank."
"11424820","11426040"," They got some good pictures for you guys."
"11426140","11431740"," And when I can't answer that with clarity for them, you can only, and you look at what is happening"
"11431740","11433000"," to all of these banks. "
"11433480","11435500"," Is he trading shorts in here right now?"
"11435560","11437440"," You can only imagine, right?"
"11437820","11442980"," The panic that was going to ensue today when everybody started getting those calls today."
"11442980","11445480"," So I'm thankful we staved that off."
"11445480","11450760"," But listen, zero days to expiring of what just happened are unknown and unknowable. "
"11451020","11453980"," So I think I've got some funny pictures in here for all of you."
"11454100","11455560"," We use signs and everything."
"11455560","11460900"," But if you have a three to five year time, I've got a, you know, in venture capital, our time"
"11460900","11461180"," rising. "
"11461240","11462460"," I don't know if you can see that."

"11995050","11995870"," realize it either."
"11996590","11999790"," And Winky had made this comment prior to today."
"12001230","12002910"," And I just agreed with Winky. "
"12003070","12007410"," I was like, I was like, I was like, I'm not a fan of Jim Kramer."
"12007410","12008070"," Never have been."

"12016010","12017970"," Jim Kramer sucks balls train, right?"
"12019910","12023150"," And so I was anti-Jim Kramer and then we give me that comment to me. "

"12036170","12037250"," I used to dislike him often. "
"12037930","12038530"," I remember."
"12039290","12041790"," I remember when he went on the John Stewart show."
"12043130","12045490"," And he was told he threw everybody into the bus. "
"12045730","12048330"," I will I still to this day think that he threw everybody into the bus."
"12051470","12053270"," But Winky's comment or point."
"12057050","12059070"," There's this weird like. "
"12061550","12063830"," There's a few different arguments about Jim Kramer."
"12064170","12067610"," And one of them is that he's a horrible stock picker for retail investors."
"12068870","12071550"," That's I think what Winky is pointing towards, right?"
"12071810","12073130"," Is he looking out for the retail investor?"
"12073650","12075210"," Does he make good calls or bad calls?"
"12076310","12076890"," That kind of stuff. "
"12076890","12081350"," So the dev actually likes Jim Kramer."
"12082990","12089730"," And not only does he like Jim Kramer, but he got me to get stopped out here in just a"
"12089730","12089950"," moment."
"12090670","12098770"," Not only does he like Jim Kramer, but he has a tool that he's developed to track all of the"
"12098770","12102750"," stocks that Jim Kramer talks about over the course of a year. "
"12102750","12105870"," And there's two fascinating things."
"12107050","12108930"," You guys are going to be able to take a look at this."
"12109270","12111070"," I'm going to get I'm going to get stopped the fuck out right now. "
"12112690","12116090"," With two fascinating things about the Jim Kramer tool."
"12117490","12119890"," Is that first off."
"12121010","12123730"," The vastness of the tickers that he talks about. "
"12123730","12126590"," This guy talks about more stock tickers."
"12127230","12130570"," Then you can imagine you think you know how many tickers he talks about."
"12130570","12137310"," But in reality, he probably talks about more tickers than anyone else out in public. "
"12139110","12142210"," This guy talks about every ticker you can think about."
"12143310","12148070"," We're talking thousands, thousands of tickers every year."
"12150130","12154490"," If you look at all the tickers that he talks about in the course of a year, he's going to"
"12154490","12155290"," get some wrong. "
"12156010","12161990"," There's just no possibility of him getting his calls right on this vast number of tickers that he"
"12161990","12163870"," that he talks about."
"12164330","12167910"," But the most fascinating part is that his record."
"12168830","12170330"," His actual record. "
"12172610","12176850"," His actual record on the on these tickers is a winning record."
"12177870","12179010"," Which is very different."
"12179170","12180230"," I'm going to get stopped out right now. "
"12180530","12181410"," I already fucking know it."
"12182310","12185790"," His actual record is a winning record on the year."
"12186610","12189410"," So he's actually a good stock picker. "
"12190010","12193470"," And it's fascinating to see that because if you watch."
"12195990","12198310"," Or if you if you ascribe to."
"12198970","12200290"," If you ascribe to. "
"12201210","12203450"," I don't know the."
"12204630","12205350"," The."
"12208710","12210270"," What is it called the start of the V."
"12212250","12213570"," Get the name of the word, but. "
"12217270","12218250"," Like the current."
"12219430","12220250"," Start to the V."
"12220390","12221490"," I don't know the name of the word, but."
"12221930","12224790"," Basically what would common folk or common people think about. "
"12226130","12226790"," Jim Kramer."
"12228030","12229190"," Is actually incorrect."
"12230670","12233530"," Jim Kramer actually has a really good record of picking stocks. "
"12234610","12235590"," Year over year."
"12235850","12238370"," And so when that when we launched that tool, it's going to be."
"12238770","12241130"," I'm very excited because when you actually see. "
"12241130","12243230"," The data on Jim Kramer."
"12243990","12245650"," He's really good at picking stocks."
"12248670","12251510"," And I think when you see that for yourself, you're going to be. "
"12251890","12253590"," It's going to be counter to the."
"12255390","12259230"," The public consensus of if Jim Kramer is a good stock picker or not."
"12271220","12271760"," In the. "
"12271960","12275040"," The inverse Kramer we can we can we can destroy that with this tool."
"12275760","12278380"," We can actually say that the inverse Kramer is not correct."
"12278940","12282140"," The inverse Kramer is basically cherry picking. "
"12284060","12287800"," Is it just basically cherry picking so it's not accurate in any way shape or form."
"12335000","12338060"," Have a bearish cross forming on five minute once again."
"12349990","12351550"," This one here is going to be nasty. "
"12360820","12363220"," Price are down below three eighty sixty two if it holds."
"12365780","12369540"," I'm looking to see if I can get myself up here around three eighty seven."
"12372760","12376900"," But Jim Kramer man does a fucking great job and I didn't believe this. "
"12377120","12380920"," I didn't I didn't believe it for a minute that actually does really good picking."
"12382420","12385900"," And I think once you see this tool, you're going to be fascinated by."
"12386900","12392940"," The calls that he makes and where those picks actually go over the course of a year. "
"12400050","12401810"," How many brains he lives in rent free."
"12401810","12402730"," I was."
"12403830","12407210"," I thought that he was I thought that he was a horrible picker. "
"12407430","12412170"," Or my or my view my view originally was that I had no trust for him."
"12416700","12419260"," Here's where the confirmation is going to be for the bears."
"12425500","12427380"," Need to get out of my calls right up here. "
"12439660","12444140"," So I think I think that was my original thing on Jim Kramer was and I was I was watching"
"12444140","12445280"," Stuart the night that."
"12445280","12448840"," That he had Kramer on."
"12449620","12451000"," I'm flat right now, by the way. "
"12453780","12456100"," The the night that he was on."
"12457220","12461240"," Was the night that I realized that they don't fucking care about you, right?"
"12461520","12462280"," CNBC doesn't care."
"12462400","12463120"," They'll sell right into you. "
"12464520","12467080"," But if you track what Jim Kramer actually does."
"12468140","12470000"," The guy the guy makes good picks."
"12472880","12475680"," The guy legitimately legitimately makes good picks. "
"12477220","12483220"," And you guys will have access to that to be able to see it."
"12483940","12485400"," And this is the pure data."
"12485740","12490860"," So you're not going to be able to or you can be persuaded by the inverse Kramer bullshit that you"
"12490860","12491040"," see. "
"12491220","12491500"," It's funny."
"12491680","12493980"," I like the inverse Kramer don't get me wrong."
"12494000","12494660"," I think it's hilarious. "
"12506540","12511620"," Yeah, but it's still not what it's I'm not saying that you can't make money off the inverse Kramer"
"12511620","12512000"," trade."
"12512000","12514460"," But it's it's causation."
"12515120","12516320"," It's not it's not real. "
"12517360","12521240"," The idea here is that if you inverse Kramer, you're going to make money and then it's just not"
"12521240","12521520"," true."
"12523160","12525820"," It's just not it's just not with the data."
"12525840","12526500"," It's not true. "
"12527380","12530140"," You actually lose you net lose money in versing Kramer."
"12537140","12540980"," The data doesn't support that claim that the inverse Kramer works."
"12542960","12547560"," Now you can pick specific trades and say, you know, this one printed or that one printed. "
"12548920","12551080"," But the inverse Kramer as a whole does not work."
"12564060","12565180"," We have all the data."
"12566180","12567180"," We have all the data. "
"12567300","12568000"," We don't have some of the data."
"12568240","12568540"," We have it all."
"12570220","12579520"," I think I think when you look at this site versus unusual oils, I think you're kind of shocked. "
"12599700","12600940"," So I'm flat right now."
"12622370","12626330"," Penny made delays risky mortgage bond sales amid market unrest."
"12641350","12641830"," Yeah. "
"12641830","12645950"," Yeah, you guys can look at the you guys can you guys will see it all."
"12646310","12649230"," You'll see every single trade that he not trade, but every single."
"12651130","12656930"," Pick that he makes right this one sell this one by this one sell this one by this one and"
"12656930","12661150"," the timeline that he has it on and he's overall a great ticker. "
"12661150","12665930"," I just couldn't believe the vastness of tickers that he actually talks about."
"12666930","12672490"," That's the one that kind of blew my mind was the guy is the guy it talks about every not"
"12672490","12673930"," every, but pretty much every."
"12676030","12677910"," Talked it not even talked about just. "
"12679470","12684030"," You know, not obscure tickers, but known tickers to most investors and traders."

"13282010","13283530"," She was telling us to go in puts."
"13284150","13285630"," Yeah, so let's talk about Thursday. "
"13285990","13289070"," Do you remember on last Thursday when I was talking about the bullish set up on spy?"
"13289710","13294770"," When I had to stop the stream to calm down the audience and then I had to turn off the"

"13299110","13299410"," Probably not. "
"13303210","13304270"," I don't know."
"13306150","13307750"," I don't know what's going on."
"13314800","13319040"," Yeah, I think that happened the last time too. "
"13319680","13321900"," I think you had people are getting cut up in the stream on Thursday."
"13323180","13328100"," And so then I can, of course, trade, stream, read the comments on Thursday and then watch the"
"13328100","13328360"," market."
"13330020","13331860"," I think that pissed me off a lot. "
"13340330","13341030"," Yeah, you are."
"13341130","13345890"," I know that I know that the data says the data speaks to the data speaks to."
"13347510","13351950"," The data speaks to Jim Kramer being more right than wrong, not wrong, more wrong than right. "
"13365580","13369060"," And then the other side of this too is that you've got."
"13371300","13380750"," I was thinking I'm going to read this."
"13403880","13404940"," We're bearish right now. "
"13406020","13410100"," As long as we trade on this five minute right now, as long as we trade underneath this white line"
"13410100","13411500"," and this red line right now, we're bearish."
"13416070","13417890"," I'll show it to you on a larger time frame here."
"13418010","13418210"," Hold on. "
"13427790","13428410"," Hold on a second."
"13431500","13433580"," So let's look at this on a larger time frame here."
"13435000","13436600"," Let's just scale up for a minute here. "
"13440040","13444560"," So we're waiting for is for this white line to cross over shows to you right here."
"13445460","13446760"," You watch this white line."
"13446800","13448620"," I guess we draw these out for you all the time, right?"
"13453160","13454100"," Hold on a second here. "
"13458930","13463170"," You're waiting for the one minute to cross over here and price to stay under."
"13465850","13466290"," Right."
"13466490","13468470"," That shows you the down move right there. "
"13469250","13475330"," Now, if in the next hour or so, if you see price cross above, let's say, right?"
"13476910","13486920"," You're not going to get the bear at the bullish crossover that you're looking"
"13486920","13487500"," for, right?"
"13487800","13489120"," So you switch side to side."
"13489260","13489900"," So right now I'm flat."
"13491100","13496880"," So the bull trades not until right here until your prices above that white line until then we're"
"13496880","13497320"," bearish. "
"13531500","13533200"," What was the one will it be ready?"
"13535240","13535680"," Zangelo."
"13536120","13539080"," So the site Zangelo is asking, when will it be ready?"
"13539400","13542000"," So the site is being worked on right now."
"13542000","13545500"," We've got a front and back end being developed right now. "
"13546120","13549320"," We expect I think we're in week four right now."
"13549320","13555700"," So in the next four weeks, we should have a beta test available for people to check it out, see"
"13555700","13557420"," what works and what doesn't work for them."
"13558940","13563260"," So what you end up doing is you end up we end up testing it for about a month. "
"13563820","13566620"," So about a month away from beta test launch."
"13568160","13572220"," And what you get in that right now is you end up getting."
"13574460","13577980"," I think it's about a month of testing and then it'll be released to the public. "
"13580880","13586140"," Now, the cool part about this is the cool part about all of this is that you end up getting."
"13586880","13591840"," You can actually get by without signing up for anything."
"13592160","13593760"," There's like there's a free option. "
"13594140","13596080"," There's a low paid option."
"13596740","13598160"," There's a mid-tiered option."
"13598460","13604520"," And then when will you get actual text messages or emails sent to you with alerts?"
"13607300","13611220"," You can actually get by that at some point you'll actually see me stop using this stuff. "
"13612140","13615560"," So you'll stop seeing all these lines on a chart and that kind of stuff."
"13615660","13620850"," You'll just see me draw boxes up and down on live stream."
"13621510","13623010"," And the live stream will always stay free. "
"13626270","13629970"," So you can actually get by with just enough information."
"13642300","13643500"," Who is the testing?"
"13643940","13649620"," So my assumption here is that you got anyone that's like watching the live streams every day,"
"13649620","13655260"," anyone that's in the Discord, anyone on anyone that's in the know, I guess, will get an invitation."
"13656480","13662060"," And if you've signed up, so I have a placeholder website called captainjimjames.com."
"13662620","13665000"," And a bunch of you have already signed up for that. "
"13666120","13668840"," So you will get rolled over into the new site."
"13669420","13671300"," Some of you actually know what the new site is."
"13671300","13672220"," Most of you don't. "
"13672340","13678240"," I think we've got total maybe 20 people working on all of this in the background."
"13680820","13682600"," I think it's 20 people total."
"13683020","13686440"," So some of the people on this stream actually are helping in the background right now. "
"13687980","13693420"," So you'll know, you'll get an invitation or if you've already signed up at captainjames.com."
"13693700","13697780"," You'll be rolled right into the beta test and you'll be told publicly, not publicly, but you'll get"
"13697780","13700680"," an email that says, here's the actual website."
"13701880","13708220"," And come beta test it and you'll have it will have a room inside the discord so you can go"
"13708220","13709440"," through it and say, this works."
"13709580","13710280"," This doesn't work. "
"13710460","13710880"," This is right."
"13711060","13711460"," This is wrong."
"13711960","13712860"," I don't like this. "
"13713060","13713760"," I do like that."
"13714940","13717200"," And then we'll roll it out to the public."
"13717320","13721280"," You'll get a free trial for five days, I believe right now. "
"13721340","13722060"," It's at five days."
"13723160","13724400"," So we'll roll it out publicly."
"13725340","13727860"," New people can test it for five days once it's public. "
"13728400","13731180"," And if they don't like it, they don't have to fucking pay for it."
"13731360","13733200"," If they do like it, they can pay for it."
"13733400","13736080"," The problem here is that the federal advisory corporation. "
"13736620","13740960"," The problem here is that it costs a lot of money in the developments and then the running of the"
"13740960","13741220"," shit."
"13741520","13742000"," It's like 50."
"13742560","13743500"," So just the data. "
"13749020","13751440"," I don't know how much that's a lot of money."
"13751440","13752340"," That's just that alone."
"13752520","13755580"," That's not the ongoing running cost of a bunch of other shit in there. "
"13757360","13763640"," And there's some other things to like Twitter tried to shut down Twitter fall and some other"
"13763640","13766460"," websites that try to collect data off Twitter."
"13766600","13768600"," We think that we've."
"13769900","13778400"," We think that we've somehow found a way around it so we can track actual sentiment in the sentiment"
"13778400","13779820"," in social media. "
"13780940","13784500"," So which is kind of cool where Twitter fall has been shut down."
"13784660","13787900"," We think we have a version of it that we think is going to work well."
"13788680","13792080"," So we have some cool shit that you can't find anywhere right now. "
"13793810","13797310"," Spy fighting for its life right now, trying to get above the one in five minute."
"13813430","13817850"," No change in the price of 390 is right now still around 56, 57 cents."
"13829400","13832120"," Price now above the one in five minute on spy. "
"13841200","13842500"," See if they can hold above here."
"13842620","13843060"," It's one minute."
"13856340","13859000"," Price bouncing around between the one and five minute right now. "
"13863660","13866340"," Bullish crossover on velocity on the one minute."
"13867320","13868820"," Five minutes still looking weak."
"13869120","13872740"," The hourly starting to look a little bit more bullish but not quite showing it yet. "
"13885850","13888910"," Coming weeks, let's say four weeks, three weeks, four weeks, something like that."
"13889550","13891490"," Somewhere in there to the beta test."
"13892630","13893190"," What is it?"
"13893770","13895810"," We have March 13th. "
"13896510","13899750"," We're right around April 15th or so, 14th somewhere in there."
"13917950","13918750"," Yeah, it's not easy."
"13918910","13926150"," We tried to we actually tried to bring on a first round of developers and we had problems with"
"13926150","13926450"," them. "
"13927030","13928930"," We didn't like what they were what they were offering."
"13928930","13932210"," And so it took some time to find the right people."
"13933030","13934970"," So now the developer that we have right now is. "
"13937750","13945350"," X space X employee and I works for another big tech company as their lead to lead a developer for"
"13945350","13946010"," artificial intelligence."
"13952450","13954050"," And he's really good."
"13954470","13955370"," Really good. "
"13955850","13958990"," Highly intelligent comes with great qualifications."
"13966840","13969440"," We will be not at the not at the current moment."
"13969620","13969840"," We're not. "
"13970480","13973780"," We're trying right now to we're actually looking for on air talent."
"13974760","13981060"," We're looking for people to do recap videos end of the day and then do like a weekend stock picking"
"13981060","13983540"," show and the weekend still struggling to find that person."
"13983940","13985400"," It's not an easy thing to find. "
"13987080","13988700"," So that's what we're looking for right now."
"13990860","13995480"," I'd like to have some kind of a not quite round the clock, but have a live stream during the"
"13995480","14000740"," day then have market recap at nighttime and then stock picking every weekend on a Saturday or"
"14000740","14002500"," Sunday spend time with."
"14009130","14010410"," Yeah, I love for Winky too. "
"14012050","14015930"," I'd love to see Winky do like a Saturday or Sunday morning something, but I don't know if he's"
"14015930","14017050"," interested in that as of yet."
"14017690","14020130"," I keep asking or I keep like slightly asking him."
"14024140","14029400"," We could give a really cool we give a really cool like a face mask type of thing. "
"14030480","14031260"," For Winky."
"14031800","14035100"," So publicly you'd see like a face mat like a snack or is it snap."
"14036340","14037540"," Face mask on him. "
"14056140","14060880"," Yeah, people don't realize that winky people don't realize how much work it takes."
"14061140","14062020"," They have no idea."
"14065880","14067220"," Yeah, they have no idea brother. "
"14069980","14071340"," It looks easy, but it's not."
"14073900","14075080"," Yeah, I know that's what they think."
"14078160","14079340"," I don't need any of that. "
"14080980","14083600"," They think that's what it is, but it's not of course."
"14084780","14085360"," No, I'm good."
"14085680","14095530"," Yeah, and then not only that like so like live streaming you'll"
"14095530","14098130"," see like I'm not going to name names, but you'll see people out there that. "
"14099190","14103450"," You might see like book map thrown up in a stock chart thrown up."
"14103570","14107610"," You won't see anything else or you won't see a video screen with it."
"14107610","14109590"," You won't see ticker tape reading. "
"14109950","14113770"," You won't see a whole bunch of other stuff that goes on in the background."
"14114110","14117770"," So right now I've got two computers tethered, but I normally have three."
"14119070","14121330"," The entire rig when it's done costs. "
"14122150","14126270"," A lot of money, a ton of money."
"14127070","14128910"," And then the data I've got a commercial."
"14130350","14134730"," Even though the internet where I live sucks, but when the internet is on, I've got a commercial"
"14134730","14136290"," line into my house. "
"14137350","14140090"," And then of course the fucking camera cost a thousand bucks."
"14141170","14141970"," Not kidding."
"14147600","14152580"," Yeah, no, well, you even see it in like you'll see some people will do a live video. "
"14152580","14153540"," They're not even streamers."
"14153680","14156720"," It's like a do a live video and you'll notice that they bring up."
"14156720","14158040"," They won't even show charts. "
"14158040","14160880"," They won't, they'll just bring up like an article that's been cut."
"14161540","14165680"," It's because of what it takes actually put this stuff out within like four, like a four second"
"14165680","14165940"," delay."
"14166880","14167820"," It's just not easy. "
"14179450","14182890"," And then like you could then you're reading the comments and then you're trying to listen to the"
"14182890","14186730"," news and then you're trying to see what's going on and then you're trying to make trades."
"14187950","14188770"," It's not easy."
"14189510","14190450"," Very, very difficult. "
"14205250","14206190"," Still a bear flag."
"14207310","14210590"," Still still bear playing forming on the spy."
"14211150","14211670"," No changes. "
"14216190","14219970"," Need to see a trade above a three eighty seven oh four."
"14220810","14224370"," Not a trade, but price above three eighty seven oh four to take along."
"14232390","14236410"," Yeah, but still winky, you know, then you have to do the research and all these that's another cool"
"14236410","14240310"," thing too is I was hoping this one of the tools on this website. "
"14241430","14243930"," Lists off stock picks automated."
"14245170","14251470"," So the cool part would be my thought process here is that one of these tools actually gives you"
"14251470","14252150"," stock picks."
"14253610","14255210"," And it gives you three kinds. "
"14255450","14256590"," It gives you a squeeze scanner."
"14257130","14257630"," It gives you."
"14258350","14261730"," It's not like a squeeze like I paid for a newsletter. "
"14262570","14268090"," I was paying for a newsletter for like six hundred a month like two months ago, three months ago."
"14268090","14272270"," I've actually showed a few people this newsletter and I think it's six hundred a month."
"14272330","14274050"," Maybe it was four hundred four or six hundred bucks. "
"14274050","14274570"," Can't remember."
"14275210","14278170"," And this guy had a stock screen or a squeeze scanner."
"14279290","14280850"," And it's readily available information. "
"14281970","14288030"," And it listed off like three hundred different stocks and it didn't tell you anything like which"
"14288030","14288950"," one would rip."
"14290210","14296010"," So one of the tools is a picker for what's the what's the most probable."
"14296810","14301990"," Picker that's going to squeeze and it gives you like sometimes it gives you zero. "
"14301990","14306490"," Sometimes it gives you one four or five picks to be watching, right?"
"14307130","14307830"," So you're watching."
"14308630","14310790"," No, this scanner tool."
"14311870","14314870"," The other picker is a stock to watch. "
"14315790","14316430"," Tool."
"14316790","14320850"," So you want to like watch this stock as it develops over time."
"14320850","14327850"," And then the last tool is this is one to be looking for an entry in would be would be"
"14327850","14335810"," super cool is if we have this these three tools and then we track those tickers on a Saturday show. "
"14337790","14341790"," So where if it's if it's spitting out these tickers through the week, we start track them."
"14341790","14349090"," We start chart them put them on trading view and then you can have access to them as they develop"
"14349090","14349850"," or fail."
"14349850","14355810"," And you'll also get alerts built into their consolidation moves higher where they should be bought"
"14355810","14358050"," that kind of stuff and we can track the performance. "
"14358490","14361630"," Now you guys know that I post stocks on Twitter."
"14362370","14365630"," Every now and again, you've seen me in the past two years."
"14365890","14372590"," You see me post specific tickers with their charts and some of you out there have created ETFs that"
"14372590","14374610"," have followed them over two or two years. "
"14374610","14377910"," And you actually know the wind fail rate on those tickers."
"14377910","14384010"," I think I'm at 90% of 100 to 300% winners on all of these tickers."
"14384130","14385350"," I post every single one of them. "
"14385710","14388610"," All together like a 90% win rate on them."
"14388870","14390970"," Those came from these screeners."
"14391610","14394870"," So if this works out, we can track this. "
"14395250","14399390"," Now the cool part would be to have somebody streaming it and then have like a winky come in because"
"14399390","14403570"," winky picks a lot of stocks that don't meet the criteria for a tool."
"14404070","14404830"," But are winners."
"14405650","14411650"," So if you can add wikis stock picks into an automated stock picker, it'd be fascinating to see how"
"14411650","14412570"," those work out over time. "
"14414870","14416450"," But again, it's a ton of work."
"14432900","14435600"," One minute coming down now to cross over the five minute."
"14443050","14445310"," Spy continues to tee off on the one minute. "
"14446130","14448310"," I'm going to switch back over to the one minute right here."
"14449150","14450930"," I'll show you the one minute chart real quick."
"14451370","14453470"," And here's the white line right here. "
"14453850","14455190"," Three six forty one."
"14455670","14457670"," They keep teeing off from above."
"14459030","14466610"," We want to see price get above right now three eighty six ninety nine on the one minute chart. "
"14467330","14472410"," Right up here three ninety three sixty six ninety nine it needs to get above for a crossover."
"14472830","14474190"," And even then you're looking for some development."
"14475210","14476250"," So you want to see. "
"14478030","14481630"," You want to see price get above the one in the five minute."
"14483970","14485150"," And it could reverse."
"14485170","14486630"," You could get a nice trade. "
"14486870","14488130"," If you want to take a bullish trade here."
"14488590","14491970"," Probably want to see it come back down and retest for this move higher here."
"14493210","14497870"," So watch this develop if it does turn bullish but currently it's bearish. "
"14523720","14526480"," Yeah, the trade is talking about on Twitter and I'm going to take it over by the man."
"14529020","14530060"," Yeah, I agree with that too."
"14530200","14532500"," That is one fair too. "
"14537930","14540050"," We've we have actually discussed that in meetings."
"14542490","14545790"," We've discussed in meetings leaving a lot of this stuff too."
"14546190","14549390"," You have to do your own research to come to your own conclusions. "
"14549390","14556070"," And the actual picking you would have to have to be a small group."
"14557030","14559090"," So that doesn't get overrun with sellers."
"14573580","14576760"," Want to see price get above three eighty six ninety four. "
"14580490","14583030"," Three eighty six ninety four is the magic number for bulls."
"14584290","14589030"," If you do get price above three eighty six ninety four you're going to look for the retest."
"14589670","14590990"," Right down there again. "
"14592950","14593930"," For the trade are."
"14597460","14600760"," Now one thirty bears were not able to get a lower price here."
"14601120","14602840"," This is a big move here for bulls. "
"14603440","14607620"," You've got it's now one thirty in the afternoon bears not able to get a new low."

"14615840","14617240"," Off of this one minute."
"14617440","14619900"," So this is being turned over to the bulls now."

"14687980","14690340"," All these other all this other shit cost money."
"14690340","14695640"," And then you've got people that have been volunteering like crazy like if you look at. "
"14696060","14701740"," Can list some of these people off but like Winky and Binky and your wife's boyfriend Jason Hendrix."
"14702300","14705000"," You've got a Joe donut Chas."

"14812760","14816600"," Institutions keep selling into that into this level and they will continue to as well until the"
"14816600","14817100"," buyers are. "

"17075830","17077910"," So for me personally, what I'm looking for."
"17080010","17083670"," Is I'm looking to trade up and put on a ratio spread up here."
"17086310","17088570"," I'd really like to take that ratio spread up here. "
"17089710","17090430"," At 400."

"17100320","17105100"," This is really the trade that I'm looking for."
"17105100","17106160"," I'm looking for some large money. "
"17106300","17110360"," I'd like to put like fairly decent amount of money on a market hedge up here."

"17132200","17133820"," Automatic triggers. "
"17134280","17137840"," you know the thing last night too in the middle of the night I was thinking to myself and I'm"
"17137840","17145140"," like, man, I'm like, I'm like, it'd be better if we went up in cash market so that they didn't"
"17145140","17148480"," sell this down in pre-market and that's what they, that's surely what they did."
"17149400","17154280"," They sold that one hour and now the one hour is lower, it's down here and they sold it down"
"17154280","17158020"," earlier in the daytime and we're just looking to get above it."
"17159720","17164600"," Bull's just want to be above that daily, that hourly trigger, so at least have some breathing room"
"17164600","17168920"," to try to get up here and hit that daily trigger on the high. "
"17173240","17176000"," Oh, dude, my calls are like 75 cents right now."
"17176460","17183320"," So, just looking at the net, just looking at the next few days, we've got volatility tomorrow,"

"17224180","17232080"," support right, but this whole area here so vicinity right here is December support."
"17233000","17236440"," We have one major issue in the market is that is the only support we have. "
"17236640","17241720"," If we were if we were above the weekly and monthly trigger and December support, I'd be like, fuck"
"17241720","17242660"," yeah, this is awesome."
"17243560","17248220"," It's good to be it's good to be above all four of those or three of those at the same"
"17248220","17248560"," time."
"17248980","17254560"," It's even better to be above all three of those and the hourly and daily, but we're not right now. "
"17255100","17255960"," We're below them."
"17256660","17262680"," So your stance is still bearish here even if we go up here with it's bearish, you need to be."
"17266170","17272070"," If this is the trigger here right for you to get bullish again, you need price to get above this"

"17294510","17295410"," three 91 C."
"17295550","17300790"," So if you're looking for trend in the market right now, you need to be looking for a couple things"
"17300790","17301110"," here. "
"17305090","17306750"," So just scaling back in."
"17307630","17313570"," This is the first move higher and then you want the you want the confirmation on this one minute on"

"17348820","17350920"," There's where the big red box is right there."
"17351040","17352300"," We've got our two right here as well."
"17352540","17354000"," This is 395 88. "
"17362090","17365470"," And 395 88 corresponds with our two above here."
"17369740","17371360"," So you've got some traffic, right?"
"17371900","17373680"," It's the same charts from Sunday, basically."
"17375400","17381660"," We've got traffic at 393 86 and then at 395 98 lots of traffic. "
"17382400","17386820"," And there's all kinds of room in here for trouble for bulls."
"17390190","17392310"," So just as this shapes up here."
"17392970","17397510"," Just as if you're looking for like major trend for like 20 days, three weeks. "
"17398370","17402530"," Two weeks a week, anything like that, even right now where we are."
"17403230","17408150"," You want to see price get above all of this to become bullish again."
"17408870","17411450"," So that 400 is kind of a key level, right?"

"17419270","17421810"," Now trading 90 cents on 389 C."
"17423630","17429550"," So this here is you'd rather be up here being a seller, right?"

"17433510","17435730"," You want to be a buyer actually above all of this noise."
"17437010","17440050"," So you can catch trend for a few weeks right now. "

"22187620","22190860"," I said Quincy Crosby, chief strategist of LPL financial."
"22191360","22194320"," Is this enough to qualify as kind of a break that would have the Fed pivot?"
"22195340","22197300"," The market overall doesn't think so. "
"22197300","22199460"," Well, the market price goes volatile Monday."

"22226720","22230740"," And they're saying that some other people are saying that they are going to raise rates. "
"22231020","22232160"," I don't know if they do."
"22235980","22239080"," When I think it's going to happen, trading $0.06 right now."
"22240080","22242760"," If I had to guess what happens, they're going to pause rates. "
"22243720","22244440"," Hey, buddy."
"22245340","22248780"," That's my guess is that they pause rates in March."
"22249140","22250900"," At this point, that's what it looks like to me. "
"22255420","22256200"," They could."
"22260470","22262010"," It's hard to say here."
"22262410","22268850"," I truly think that if they if they continue to raise rates, the market might continue to trade up"
"22268850","22269230"," in sideways. "
"22270070","22272910"," If they do cut rates, we'll get that bloodbath."
"22275730","22278630"," You get a nice bat squeezed up into that rate hike and meeting."
"22280530","22282170"," Nice, beautiful squeeze, right?"
"22282410","22284030"," Rip face up like 420 or something. "
"22284330","22285690"," And then they just tee off on the market."
"22298410","22300990"," Eight cents right now in three to nine C's."
"22308540","22313500"," I agree with the statement that Timros is saying though that it's a very, it's a very fine balance"
"22313500","22313880"," here. "
"22315560","22317120"," My experience with the Fed."
"22318780","22324520"," If we're seeing cracks in regional banks, they've likely done damage that is irreversible that we"
"22324520","22325320"," haven't seen yet."
"22328180","22330120"," I think that's there. "
"22330320","22331220"," That damage is there."
"22332240","22335560"," I was on the phone with a friend who had dinner with some."
"22336620","22341500"," Owners of some large companies last night and they were of the. "
"22343160","22344200"," They were of the."
"22346700","22348180"," Opinion that things are broken."
"22352370","22355490"," And even their companies are shifting towards. "
"22356890","22358590"," The system being broken."
"22358590","22361590"," My assumption is that behind closed doors that conversation is known."
"22363390","22365290"," These are these are very large companies. "
"22366210","22368210"," So I do think that they're going to pause rates."
"22369830","22370430"," I do."
"22370550","22371850"," I think there's damage done that we don't see. "
"22372710","22377450"," I don't think I felt that only a filter or thought that until this."
"22377710","22382050"," The banking stuff that took place last week mark on closing balance, still sitting at one hundred"
"22382050","22383710"," and fifty eight million to the south side."
"22386890","22388550"," The damage is done. "
"22389390","22394790"," There's all trust in this market and in banking and in startups and not just startups."
"22395530","22398490"," If you're a business owner mid sized large business owner."
"22399450","22402030"," This is most definitely going. "
"22404150","22405810"," Put you on a defensive stance."
"22406350","22410860"," Kind of like a wait and see thing right."
"22414080","22416340"," I think I think the damage is done by the guests. "
"22416620","22417300"," The damage is done."
"22417380","22419060"," We are we haven't seen it all come out yet."
"22420000","22424940"," I think the I don't think that the rate cuts are pausing is even going to impact that stuff coming"
"22424940","22425200"," out. "
"22425580","22427900"," I think that will show itself eventually."
"22430360","22432480"," But onto the case of inflation."
"22433700","22436100"," How do they fight inflation would be the next question. "
"22439660","22446060"," So if you didn't cut rates, but just held them pause them."
"22447260","22451360"," You can continue to fight inflation in a kind of."
"22451600","22456400"," And wait and see to see if there's damage done or how extensive the damage done is. "
"22463460","22468340"," So Nick tomorrow is just putting a tweet out with attaching his article, which we did provide"
"22468340","22468760"," earlier."
"22468920","22472600"," So the tweets have to say that there is a saying that the federal reserve raises interest rates"
"22472600","22473580"," until something breaks."
"22474100","22477300"," A big surprise over the past year had been that nothing broke. "
"22484070","22485570"," Yeah, I think they stopped raising rates."
"22485750","22489050"," I agree with that saying I agree with Nick, but there's at least the pause."
"22500850","22506270"," I'm trying to think back to like 18 2018 2019 ticks. "

"22542400","22544220"," No, I think the damage is done."
"22545120","22547620"," But if I had to guess, they're going to at least want to know if the damage is done. "
"22548100","22555620"," Trade an 11 cents, 13 cents, 14 cents on three nine C."
"22559920","22561220"," I think they pause rates."
"22565110","22566770"," I think it's the wait and see at this point."
"22577380","22579060"," And I think that damage is done. "

"22636950","22637730"," Yeah, we'll see."

"22639770","22642990"," We'll take a poll that day and see if we get to pause or not. "
"22642990","22644630"," I think you get the pause."
"22647920","22655340"," I think I think if I think if it hadn't gained so much steam, if the banking crisis quote unquote"
"22655340","22659320"," hadn't gained so much steam, they would still be raising."
"22660640","22662840"," But I think the way that I think that the. "
"22666320","22671620"," I think that the steam that it's carried at this point is doing damage as we speak."
