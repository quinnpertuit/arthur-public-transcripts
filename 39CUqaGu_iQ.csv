"30980","36800"," So you can put this one on here, background, you know, mute."
"47630","52570"," So, I don't know if that can help, but I'll bring this out."
"53550","54010"," Hello, Robert. "
"55690","57970"," Hello, your wife's boyfriend, Omar."

"70570","71170"," Thank you."
"71270","71630"," How are you doing?"
"72970","73830"," Hi, Miha."

"92730","93510"," Hello, John."
"94890","95630"," It's Sunday."

"107790","108050"," How are you?"
"110430","111590"," I got a little bit of rest. "
"112170","112670"," I skied."
"113830","114410"," Hi, Chase."
"114670","114950"," How are you?"
"116330","118030"," Thanks for getting me out of this shit movie. "
"118030","118850"," My wife picked."
"120810","121610"," Hello, Phillip."
"122830","124150"," Do you have a list by chance?"
"126210","126930"," Thank you. "
"128750","130610"," Probably have to keep this under here for me."
"132470","133270"," How's everybody doing?"
"134490","136930"," Let me see if I can switch over to the live stream here."
"137690","138090"," All right. "
"138930","140310"," I hope y'all had a great weekend."
"141850","142450"," Hey, Tom."
"142610","142890"," How are you?"
"144290","144870"," Yeah, great. "
"145050","145370"," How today?"
"145830","146470"," Hey, Carrie."
"147870","148650"," I took a break."
"148710","149170"," I needed it. "
"149370","151490"," I was this week was a brutal."
"152290","156650"," It doesn't matter which side of the which side of the market you were on."
"157170","158410"," It was really straight. "
"158590","160950"," Did anybody find this past week stressful or is it just me?"
"161530","163030"," By Friday, I felt very worn out."
"164630","166230"," I skied in Michigan."
"166230","168490"," I'm originally from West. "
"169130","176170"," I'm from Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, but I've been living in Michigan, so I'm stuck here."
"177930","183370"," I spent a lot of winters in the West still, but I'm trying to move back to the West."
"183570","187730"," I should be back in the West permanently this year. "
"188590","188930"," Soon."
"189270","190230"," Spring time, I think."
"191110","195310"," I have a trip to do down south to Florida, but I'm hoping to get back out West. "
"197710","199150"," Yeah, this past week was brutal."
"201210","204230"," Yeah, the whole not stressful fun."
"204610","207810"," It was exhausting for me. "
"208450","209450"," You know, it's it's pan."
"209590","210510"," You know, for me, it's."
"211530","214750"," Last week's moves are can be brutal for a lot of people. "
"215670","218690"," You guys can you guys can you saw with me, Kevin, right?"
"220250","223830"," I guess there's some other videos came out this weekend with a lot of."
"224390","226630"," Long only YouTube channels."
"226630","228490"," They were having round table discussions all weekend. "
"229050","234750"," You know, it's and even as a new YouTuber, you know, it kind of hit me last week."
"236030","237670"," Because we've been trading this market."
"238110","239850"," We traded it up on this live stream. "
"240150","242610"," We have used to make videos, but we used to trade it."
"242670","246510"," We traded it all the way up to 4.39. And then we traded it down to the first support,"
"246510","247490"," traded it back up."
"248310","250670"," And we we called the next turn down. "
"251370","255769"," But even then, a lot of people are which they should be, right?"
"256190","258350"," Our markets been going up straight for two straight years."
"259990","266710"," And, you know, people who put a lot of time, effort and money and into into this market."
"267470","270390"," And so people people's livelihoods are on the line. "
"270610","271930"," People's retirements are on the line."
"273930","278290"," You know, and you don't want to call stuff that can hurt people's."
"279610","281870"," You want to make the wrong call, all those kind of things. "
"282690","284710"," And I'm the biggest dip buyer out there."
"285110","286110"," That's what I'm known for."
"286290","291270"," I mean, I'm always sticking my finger in the pudding, trying to grab a dip. "
"291510","296290"," Now, with that said, I hope you're all having a great night right now."
"296390","299570"," There's only 41 of you here right now, which is perfect, perfect size."
"299770","300890"," People can come back and watch this later. "
"301890","309250"," I'm going to make this kind of short tonight because I went back onto YouTube and everything I've"
"309250","312490"," said on Friday, everything that I've said all weekend."
"314210","319370"," People are now making videos about people are now talking about it on Wall Street Bats."
"319530","320850"," They're now talking about it on Twitter. "
"321510","322030"," And that's fine."
"322250","322770"," That's all good."
"323890","327050"," You know, but we have to stay one step ahead of everyone else. "
"328850","334810"," So we're going to talk about that tonight, staying one step ahead of people and where we are in the"
"334810","336790"," market and where we really are in the market."
"339130","340890"," There's some things you have to talk about."
"341650","343530"," And, you know, futures are green right now. "
"343850","345930"," Futures could turn red at any point tonight."
"346710","348730"," I'll show you in a little bit why that is."
"349270","351330"," I don't think they're going to turn red, but they could. "
"352570","359550"," And we want to talk about that because it's important to have market perspective and anticipate"
"359550","365230"," what the moves are going to be the next day, the following week."
"366290","369710"," Before they happen so that if they go your way, you have a plan."
"370110","373570"," If they don't go your way, you have a plan as well, right?"
"373770","376650"," We don't want to be thinking about at the end of the day on Friday. "
"376890","380330"," What do we think is going to happen and then, you know, and then make the wrong moves into Monday."
"381050","385170"," And we're already actually playing out as we thought what would happen into Monday."
"386570","389550"," And we discussed it on Friday after the bell as well. "
"390010","392190"," We discussed it into the 14 for 15 hour."
"392330","393910"," We discussed it on Twitter."
"394690","399450"," I think I even made a post on Friday around 6 p.m. Just to clarify and make sure everybody"
"399450","401230"," knew where I thought we were. "
"402890","405390"," Now on that subject, we got to talk about some stuff."
"406370","409130"," So this week on the economic calendar."
"411520","413640"," You know, Monday we've got PMI Tuesday. "
"413640","419460"," We've got the National Home Price Index Consumer Confidence Index, but no one really cares, right?"
"420020","424260"," The only thing everybody cares about is the Fed Chair speech, right?"
"424700","427000"," News conference is at 2.30 p.m. in the afternoon."
"428340","431340"," We do have some more."
"431820","434280"," We've got, you know, claims and continuing claims. "
"435140","437320"," We've got some inflation stuff heading into Friday."
"439040","442920"," I would be concerned about consumer sentiment."
"442920","444800"," But we know most of this stuff, right?"
"445100","451780"," And we know, actually, the FOMC, the Fed Chair, what are the expectations for the Fed Chair?"
"452380","459880"," And I made a post this week on Twitter saying that I always trade against wherever everyone is on"
"459880","465320"," the Fed Chair speech, typically around 1.1.30 in the afternoon, the minutes as well. "
"466600","468880"," And to date, it has always worked."
"469720","476320"," To date, I've never had a problem not trading against wherever everybody was at."
"476680","480160"," So if everyone's loaded up on puts, I usually take the call side. "
"480240","483180"," If everybody's loaded up on calls, I take the put side."
"483540","485980"," It even worked the last Fed minutes we had."
"486420","488240"," Everybody was loaded up on calls side. "
"489220","492300"," Everybody knew that we were priced in and we sold down."
"493040","495320"," Do I think it'll work again this week on Wednesday?"
"496080","496800"," We'll see."
"496800","500120"," We don't know what's happening on Monday, Tuesday, leading into Wednesday. "
"501700","506280"," But we do have some insight into what the banks did on Friday."
"506820","511039"," What the banks did was they closed their short positions."
"512159","516780"," They took protection into February 18th. "
"516840","520840"," And, mind you, we don't even have an FOMC in February."
"521080","522380"," We don't have one again until March."
"524100","526260"," So we have just this one, right?"
"526400","531420"," But they did take protection into the following OPEX into February 18th. "
"531660","533240"," And that's cause for some concern."
"534100","539740"," Because what they're doing is they have the long the market for a snapback play on Monday, maybe"
"539740","540640"," even into Tuesday."
"541360","547700"," And then they're able to cover themselves if that snapback play fails all the way into February"
"547700","548360"," 18th. "
"549420","553180"," So we have to be concerned about that as we trade tomorrow and into the future."
"554540","563240"," The banks have expanded the put wall down now to 420 for the concentration of puts at the 428"
"563240","563780"," level."
"565240","567140"," And so they're kind of covered here, right?"
"567320","569340"," They've covered themselves for a trip up on Monday. "
"569700","571680"," They've covered themselves if there's failure."
"573160","576400"," And I wanted to talk about something on this topic."
"576580","579000"," And that had to do with trading the market that's in front of us. "
"579820","584160"," And we cannot call levels lower levels without more information."
"584860","586600"," But we can gain insight."
"587540","591720"," You know, this drop that we just had was very bearish, right?"
"593880","600480"," And as the days stack up to weeks and then they stack up into red months and then a red"
"600480","607600"," two months into a red quarter, it does implicate how long a recovery takes from the move that we"
"607600","608080"," just made. "
"608840","614400"," The move that we just made on itself would take anywhere from one to three months to recover from."
"614920","617880"," The move that we've taken is a one to three month recovery."
"618380","625580"," If we trade down into the 428, 426 level, it starts to open the door to us down to the"
"625580","627780"," 390 level and below, believe it or not. "
"627780","634700"," And you start stacking up red weeks and red months and a couple red months than a red quarter."
"635560","638920"," The recovery from a red quarter is going, could take up to a year."
"640080","645060"," So we're going to trade what's in front of us to the right every day, but we're going to keep"
"645060","649200"," track of where we are in the market as we trade across. "
"649840","652020"," So you can't really call that."
"652100","655840"," Hey, we're at a bottom now and you can't really call that we're heading lower."
"656900","663400"," But there are some signs that we should still continue to move lower. "
"664000","666640"," One of those is the protection is short dated."
"667340","669860"," These aren't puts that are dated out one to three months."
"670240","671020"," They're not dated out. "
"671200","673140"," Excuse me, they're not dated out three months, six months."
"674280","676800"," This protection is very short dated."
"677100","683200"," These are two to four week of protection and the hedge protection there after the month, the month"
"683200","683720"," later puts. "
"684520","687840"," And we have some real concerns in the market that you can't get past."
"688580","690560"," We know about this margin debt out there."
"691260","697360"," We know that inflation coming down leads to reprising of our markets, right?"
"697560","703540"," If the dollar goes farther, there's some anticipation out there that foreign markets because they"
"703540","705900"," haven't stopped quantitative easing. "
"706500","709980"," They're devaluing their currencies."
"710600","713280"," Their products are going to be cheaper in the United States."
"714500","716820"," There's, of course, the threat of tax increases. "
"716920","717840"," We know that, right?"
"717980","721700"," We know we're talking about three, four, five, maybe even seven rate increases."
"722760","727120"," We know about QT about the money supply possibly going away."
"727460","730980"," We look towards that at this Fed meeting, if not the March Fed meeting. "
"731160","731740"," We know about tightening."
"732320","733660"," We know about the war possibilities."
"734900","738160"," We also have the Senate that's coming up a race in the Senate. "
"739040","740540"," That's coming up at the end of this year."
"740780","742920"," And you've got a presidential race kicking off."
"743360","750520"," You know, this includes a discussion at this at some time this year about our tax increases and"
"750520","752460"," taxes do matter to our market. "
"753420","758220"," And then we also have that two other major issues."
"758720","764000"," And one major issue is, you know, a lot of bulls bought this market two years ago."
"764440","767460"," And a lot of bulls bought this market previous two years ago. "
"767460","768960"," Way back in 2007, 2008."
"769880","771780"," And then you had a mad rush the last two years."
"773020","777500"," And it's not that we can't, or that I don't believe we're not going to have a blow off top. "
"777800","778080"," I do."
"778560","780620"," I'm more bearish, I think, than some bears."
"780900","785160"," And I believe in the blow off top that it's going to take place at some point. "
"785520","787140"," I think it's still on the horizon, right?"
"787480","789860"," It's always out there, like a specter."
"790540","792060"," But there's two issues with that."
"792060","798300"," And the first issue is, bulls have to be convinced that they want to take this long. "
"798540","800440"," The banks need to be convinced."
"800740","801920"," And where is that price at?"
"802200","803440"," Is that price at 440?"
"804080","807000"," Is it at 450, 460, 470, 480?"
"807520","812680"," Does it look juicier for that mad dash to the top down around 420 or 400?"
"813400","815220"," And that's where I kind of think it is."
"815820","818620"," And somewhere down below, there is a price. "
"818620","824700"," And there's been a stealth correction where a lot of tech, a lot of the speculative growth tech has"
"824700","827080"," been whacked and is almost done with their haircut."
"827700","828800"," They're almost there."
"829360","833020"," And then you've just got a few of big tech names that need to come down slightly more. "
"833460","836200"," We saw that take place with some of these banks that were driven up."
"837060","838240"," We saw it with Citigroup."
"838760","840780"," We saw it with the bullshit with GS. "
"841860","846260"," We saw it with companies like Piton that we know aren't going to survive."
"847000","848520"," And we saw it with Netflix."
"849420","855960"," And there will probably be a message given out there that we're in ER season. "
"856640","858740"," We have to see what their earnings are going to be."
"859020","860480"," What their guidance is going to be."
"860900","864380"," There's a normal distribution in the stock market. "
"865140","866240"," They're going to sell it down."
"866380","867820"," We know there's going to be snapbacks."
"868840","871580"," And they're going to tell certain people, hey, we're going up. "
"872300","873800"," We haven't shown that yet."
"873800","878540"," So there's nothing showing that we're bullish or that we are actually going up."
"879420","882280"," There's nothing showing that they were going to burn the market down either. "
"882480","884260"," We're kind of in this limbo at this point."
"884780","886380"," So we can trade the snapback."
"886780","887560"," We can leave it be. "
"887920","890000"," We'll talk about it in the chart here in just a minute."
"890380","891460"," But there's one other real problem."
"891960","894400"," And that is a real market panic. "
"895700","897540"," And there is some concern there."
"897840","903780"," And I want to talk to you guys about that stuff because there can be this moment."
"903780","910520"," This week, the next two weeks during ER season where there are some, there are seriously. "
"911460","914240"," I watched some CNBC over Friday."
"915060","915960"," Some of the clips from CNBC."
"917200","923360"," And I watched this message come out by a lot of hedge funds that were claiming that they closed"
"923360","923880"," their shorts. "
"924220","926600"," They were going to go long in specific tickers."
"927120","930900"," They named some, I think they named Nike was one of them."
"930900","933680"," There was some tech that was saved on Friday. "
"934240","935260"," A few small companies."
"936000","937680"," I think Salesforce might have been one of them."
"937900","939340"," Or there's another one. "
"941320","943460"," Anyways, a few companies that were saved on Friday."
"943860","951260"," And my real feeling and truthful thought process is that more companies got caught in the Netflix"
"951260","953520"," taking a shit and the Nike's taking a shit."
"954000","957520"," I think a lot of these small hedge funds got burned. "
"957520","961080"," And a lot of these people are going to tell you that this is the bottom."
"961220","963500"," A lot of these people are going to tell you that they were going back up from here."
"963880","968020"," And it's only to unfuck themselves as the rest of earnings season plays out. "
"968400","972320"," I think that in the background, there's market panic."
"973040","977760"," A prime example is some of these long only YouTubers."
"977980","980660"," Not just me, Kevin, but a whole lot of them are scared right now. "
"981200","986340"," You saw comments from big time Twitter personalities commenting on their statements."
"986340","989320"," You saw round table discussions over the weekend."
"989820","994360"," I intentionally went through and tried to watch some of these guys over the weekend because I want"
"994360","996020"," to see the panic and there's panic. "
"997180","999800"," Some of them are going to tell you that they're panicking and some of them are not."
"1001260","1006540"," So I want you to be aware of that that market panic can happen."
"1006540","1009420"," And you know, you run for the exits. "
"1009420","1011120"," People get trampled when that takes place."
"1011620","1017840"," And that's my real fair is that there could be market panic at some point as we wear on these"
"1017840","1018580"," next two weeks."
"1019360","1024200"," Regardless, if we should be going down or not, even if we were to break above certain key levels. "
"1025300","1027880"," Because there are some real dangers to the market."
"1028720","1035579"," And so we have to tread carefully as we trade forward is my only point in this."
"1035579","1036740"," So we're going to move on. "
"1037180","1039400"," You know, you guys know we've got a big week here, right?"
"1040300","1043599"," This is a big tech week here and next week's a big tech week."
"1044160","1046119"," We've got Madden on the second."
"1046319","1047780"," We've got Microsoft on Tuesday. "
"1048240","1049120"," We've got IBM."
"1049780","1050720"," We've got Logitech."
"1051560","1058700"," We've got a few more banks and then we've got Intel, Tesla, Boeing, ATT, Levi's, London Club,"
"1059020","1063100"," Apple, Robin, the Hood, Visa, McDonald's. "
"1063840","1065340"," You know, so I wanted to be concerned."
"1065600","1072640"," There was a lot of talk on Friday too in CNBC that value stocks should be bought right now."
"1073400","1078660"," I wanted to be concerned about this because I think that some of these small edge funds thought"
"1078660","1079420"," they were safe. "
"1080240","1083760"," And they ended up getting whacked as we move through early next week."
"1084180","1087440"," So just be concerned as we move forward in these next two weeks."
"1088200","1093860"," At any point, let's say we start driving up all these companies and we think, hey, well, we're"
"1093860","1094580"," driving them all up. "
"1094700","1099740"," There ain't no way they're going to cut the market with Apple having to pull their earnings on"
"1099740","1100000"," Thursday."
"1100480","1106380"," But I promise you, if we get up to a certain price in the market, there's a fair chance of"
"1106380","1108320"," some of these hedge funds pulling the plug."
"1109140","1112120"," Let's just be just be conscious of this as we move forward. "
"1112260","1114880"," I also want to show you one other thing or two other things."
"1115880","1117640"," First is this is SPX."
"1118760","1125340"," This is the start of the COVID run way back on the 23rd of March, 2020. "
"1126480","1129300"," And, you know, this is a retracement graph here."
"1130660","1133120"," And I want to key into some of these levels here, right?"
"1133960","1137860"," You've got a 20% correction right at an area here."
"1138400","1141800"," And just so you know, this area right here is an area that we spent time at. "
"1142100","1144000"," So you're going to expect some level of support here."
"1144000","1146580"," The same thing can be said for any of these levels."
"1147100","1153200"," Even if you don't, I only use these retracement charts to see if they sort of match up to places"
"1153200","1154520"," that we've spent time in. "
"1155100","1156640"," And you can see we spent time here."
"1157140","1159180"," You can see that we spent time here."
"1160200","1162580"," This is a 50% retracement down here. "
"1163080","1164940"," You can see that we've spent some time, right?"
"1165080","1168000"," These are like months that we've spent trading these areas."
"1169120","1172940"," So to see a 50% retracement in the market is not abnormal."
"1173400","1176200"," You know, this is down to the 3500 level. "
"1176860","1183020"," And I think I told you I think on the downside I'm expecting somewhere around here, 360, 350 on the"
"1183020","1184320"," real ugly side of things."
"1184800","1188300"," But for us to have a 50% retracement is just not crazy."
"1189300","1190240"," It just isn't. "
"1190360","1192820"," It's not even a bit that it isn't even that large of a move."
"1193420","1194900"," This is 3511 right here."
"1195960","1198000"," You can see this next level down below here. "
"1198360","1199920"," This is somewhere around 3821."
"1200700","1201960"," We've talked about this."
"1202200","1204880"," This is 4.2. Let me see. "
"1206500","1207980"," 4.4.20 or so."
"1208340","1210900"," We know that we have puts down to 420 over here already."
"1212120","1216160"," And we know we've already encountered a form of a snapback here. "
"1216240","1218980"," But there's one other thing I want to show you in this chart before we move on."
"1219740","1220900"," Let's see if I can hold on here."
"1223820","1225580"," I want to show you, I don't like the cross. "
"1226200","1227720"," I'll show you guys one other thing here."
"1227720","1233420"," And we're going to take this down a little bit smaller."
"1234660","1241060"," And I know in Friday, once people realize we were going to trade higher, all of a sudden you heard"
"1241060","1245540"," both bulls and bears saying stuff like, well, we have this gap to fill down here. "
"1246460","1253940"," We have this gap that's down here between 430, call like 436, and 440."
"1255400","1262400"," And this translates down to 435 on the mini and spy."
"1264440","1267060"," And we like to close gaps when we're down here. "
"1267580","1270700"," But in reality, they can leave gaps behind any time they want."
"1271060","1276760"," And it's wishful thinking to give a bull that sold at the last possible moment."
"1276800","1279380"," They're not going to give that guy an opportunity to buy back in. "
"1279780","1282880"," They're not going to give a bear that didn't buy any of this, right?"
"1282880","1289740"," And didn't buy this until Friday to get out and close this gap just because of this gap that they"
"1289740","1290160"," want to fill."
"1291540","1296600"," Normally, right now, what will happen is we're going to come higher."
"1296980","1298180"," And we're going to leave this gap behind. "
"1298880","1304340"," And we can fill this gap if we do another retest or two down the road in February."
"1305300","1307240"," So be careful with bulls and bears."
"1307500","1311460"," Normally when I hear bulls and bears saying we got to close this, we might. "
"1312720","1323300"," But the reality is, it is just bottom, bottom bears and bottom bulls that"
"1323300","1325840"," are hoping and praying that it opened tomorrow."
"1325840","1331380"," We trade down so they can unfucked themselves and take this long to wherever it is."
"1331840","1334020"," Just be conscious of who you're listening to out there. "
"1334900","1340620"," Another thing I want you to be conscious about tomorrow when the market opens is the tone of the"
"1340620","1341920"," news right here where we are."
"1342660","1345480"," This is a good moment to be listening to the news."
"1346300","1350740"," The tone of the news if we're going to snap back here or continue to sell. "
"1351800","1353320"," Or continue to sell down."
"1353760","1355280"," This is when I pay attention to the news."
"1355880","1362080"," I'm more interested in what they're trying to convey than what they're actually saying. "
"1362820","1364500"," I don't know if that makes any sense."
"1364500","1370620"," But we're going to look over here at the E.S. and it's funny because over the weekend, everybody"
"1370620","1375080"," now comes out with what we talked about all last week on E.S. I've got some of these levels"
"1375080","1376540"," marked out down here."
"1377500","1387100"," 4.23, 4.75, 4.0, 4.5, 0.25, 3.9, 0.08. And we're going to go a"
"1387100","1388020"," little bit closer here. "
"1388460","1391740"," We're going to keep this short because I think you guys have gotten all the information that you"
"1391740","1396500"," need from other YouTube channels."
"1396780","1398000"," I don't think you need this for me."
"1398220","1400880"," I think you mostly need for me a live stream during the day. "
"1401380","1404860"," So you can pay attention to what's on board for us tomorrow."
"1406140","1408340"," So we're going to keep this real short and simple tonight."
"1408920","1412040"," On your own charting software, buy more tonight. "
"1412420","1417300"," Before I go to bed, I'm going to post classic levels for you here."
"1417300","1423240"," And I'm going to also post for you the gamma and volatility zones on Twitter."
"1424500","1427820"," And just on this one right here, I want to talk to you about this one. "
"1428040","1433000"," So just this channel right here."
"1433520","1435600"," This is a major channel right here."
"1436000","1438760"," The bulls want to see a trade above here. "
"1440560","1441680"," We'll make this one thicker."
"1441680","1445940"," This is really what the bulls for even even to start becoming bullish."
"1446740","1448620"," You know, there's a lot of traffic before we get there. "
"1449040","1452360"," And this is what the bulls are looking for to actually get bullish."
"1452580","1452800"," Okay."
"1453000","1453940"," Any kind of bullishness. "
"1454660","1455060"," Yeah."
"1455360","1455640"," Hold on."
"1455660","1458340"," We change the. "
"1461560","1462740"," Hold on here for a second."
"1467940","1472100"," The bulls are looking for some kind of a V shape recovery and then I move higher, right?"
"1472100","1475260"," They need to have that if they don't have that."
"1476220","1477740"," This is the only thing that's bullish. "
"1477860","1482340"," Another thing that could happen if you wanted to do something bullish would be that retest down"
"1482340","1483120"," below to 435."
"1483720","1485000"," This is not on the correct time scale."
"1485620","1490380"," You look for a retest down below another retest, but these are giant moves right here. "
"1490740","1492180"," And then you would see another move higher."
"1492360","1495260"," So if you're bullish, you're looking for some kind of move like this."
"1495740","1496920"," A big giant crown. "
"1497100","1498880"," You're not looking for this move tomorrow morning."
"1499440","1500800"," You're looking for something big."
"1500800","1501740"," Okay. "
"1502120","1505120"," Even if it takes two times of a tap to go higher."
"1505640","1509160"," Now, with that all being said, even with."
"1509620","1510260"," Hold on here. "
"1514200","1515000"," Even with."
"1516640","1518260"," Let's say we do a V shape recovery."
"1518800","1521060"," I'm going to talk about the bulls real quick so they have some idea. "
"1521680","1525780"," Even if you get the V shape recovery as a bull."
"1527120","1527800"," Let's say you do."
"1527900","1531100"," Let's say this is the bottom and you get this giant move up. "
"1531440","1537140"," I would still expect some form of a move down first and then possibly like this."
"1537220","1540700"," It's going to be tough for me to believe that we trade up here and do this kind of a"
"1540700","1541240"," move up higher."
"1541780","1543180"," I still think it gets rejected. "
"1543840","1548480"," I still think that we retest the second time possibly even a third time into March."
"1549180","1551420"," You'll see these two moves then the move higher."
"1551420","1555180"," And that could signal the end of the bear move. "
"1556060","1556200"," Right."
"1556980","1560800"," I don't think I think I give a low probability of this move happening."
"1561220","1566380"," And the biggest reason for me lending the biggest move reason for this move not happening is mostly"
"1566380","1570240"," because I don't think anybody can see us trading above 480. "
"1570860","1573340"," 500 into the rest of 2022."
"1574160","1576940"," We're going to throw up 560 points by December."
"1577720","1579640"," So I still don't see it from where we are. "
"1579640","1582880"," I can't give the bulls the credence here."
"1582960","1584480"," I just can't and I'm not going to."
"1584720","1586640"," I'm going to be even for myself as a bull. "
"1586800","1591800"," I don't feel comfortable buying this dip for the year where we are right now."
"1592140","1596700"," I don't even think that I would believe a bull telling me that we're going to trade sideways from"
"1596700","1602020"," this point forward unless we were to have one huge bottom and maybe in June or July."
"1602560","1604200"," I guess there's an outlier case for that. "
"1604200","1607020"," We trade higher in sideways and then down into June or July."
"1607220","1609860"," We finally make a rip up into December."
"1610220","1611600"," I guess that's always in the table. "
"1612100","1616220"," But the reality is there's a lot of traffic from here to here."
"1616440","1618220"," And I haven't posted them all here for you."
"1618460","1623320"," There are a bunch of different different resistance points on this one. "
"1624700","1629540"," There are a bunch of just different resistance points on this on this chart."
"1629820","1631640"," I'll have a chart for you out in the morning."
"1631640","1633400"," But there's traffic. "
"1634020","1634760"," So much traffic."
"1635920","1640220"," And no matter where we trade here, even this is pretty violent right here."
"1640380","1642940"," But believe it or not, this is resistance for you. "
"1643300","1644880"," We could trade up here into tomorrow."
"1645300","1646620"," Try up to 4, 4, 6, 1."
"1646780","1649640"," We could try up to 4, 5, excuse me, 4, 5, 100."
"1650000","1652120"," A lot of bulls are targeting 4, 500. "
"1652860","1657580"," A lot more bulls are targeting up here around 40, 45, 70, somewhere in this area."
"1657580","1658240"," 4,600."
"1658600","1660540"," And then another sell down. "
"1661260","1662700"," I'm not so sure."
"1663000","1664200"," I think we snap back tomorrow."
"1664860","1668580"," I think we wait for the FOMC. "
"1668900","1675140"," I think the snap back is reasonable to expect possibly 4, 4, 7, maybe 4, 50."
"1675800","1679340"," And then we start trading sideways and down into Wednesday."
"1680280","1681080"," Wait for an announcement. "
"1681340","1685500"," And that decides if we go up or make that next leg down into February."
"1685500","1687500"," If we make the next leg down into 4, 28."
"1687960","1689640"," Now, that's my take. "
"1690360","1694760"," Now, even with all this being said, I do want to talk to you about some points here."
"1694980","1702100"," If we sell down tonight before the open tomorrow, it's a very off chance that it happens."
"1702540","1708660"," But if we sell down, let's say we sell down into the open tomorrow, we sell the news and we"
"1708660","1713220"," put another 15% or 20% in the board, like some people are calling for out there. "
"1714020","1717840"," If you saw something like that, that is extremely bullish."
"1718180","1726880"," That is a move that would signify not only are we going to trade down to a localized bottom, even"
"1726880","1731600"," if we don't get there right now, that is a sign that we're going to more than likely be read"
"1731600","1732580"," the entire year."
"1732920","1734820"," We will trade down the entire year. "
"1735320","1740060"," Moves like selling down the market into open tomorrow before the open tomorrow."
"1740060","1746040"," Anything crazy like that is one of the most bearish moves this market could make at this point,"
"1746080","1747440"," even if we are bearish."
"1747720","1749300"," It's more bearish than being in bear country. "
"1749960","1752180"," It's not even a market correction move."
"1752400","1755140"," It is a market crash type move."
"1755340","1758120"," So if we see this move, we'll have to plan accordingly. "
"1759160","1763980"," My guess is that we trade up to this 4, 4, 5, 7, maybe 4, 5, we can look at"
"1763980","1764620"," a closer level."
"1768060","1769160"," Look at it even better here."
"1769800","1772360"," My thought is that we trip to 4, 4, 7, 2."
"1772600","1779180"," We possibly trade above into 4, 50, 4, 5, 50 or somewhere up in here. "
"1779400","1781040"," Start trading sideways and down on a Wednesday."
"1781560","1783620"," This will be my anticipation or my expectation."
"1784520","1788780"," We have some other places above to look at 4, 5, 9, 5, 0."
"1789000","1790520"," That's that 4, 60 level. "
"1791240","1793380"," We've got some others above it, 4, 6, 3, 7."
"1793920","1797500"," And then we've got 4, 6, 8, 2 and low and behold 4, 700."
"1797500","1798800"," I don't think we have to decide."
"1798980","1800500"," We don't have calls structured to get this eye. "
"1800860","1804220"," Most of the calls taken into the close were in the money type stuff."
"1805120","1810940"," And I'm guessing that dealers are buying futures on all of that stuff that took place end of day"
"1810940","1812880"," after the close on Friday."
"1813700","1815100"," So we'll see what happens tomorrow. "
"1815500","1820820"," But if we do sell deep down here at any point between now and open tomorrow, we're going to have"
"1820820","1825280"," to start setting our sites down to the 390s, 360s, that kind of stuff."
"1825280","1826880"," We're going to get our full bear suit on."
"1827460","1828800"," So what does this leave us as traders?"
"1829420","1830360"," Where does it leave us as investors?"
"1831380","1834640"," And that is that we're in a day traders market, plain and simple. "
"1835740","1840020"," If you were short, I know some of you, like I'm not going to name names right now, but I've"
"1840020","1842860"," been short since above here, then this is all noise too."
"1843760","1849460"," If you bought, if you started shorting down here, you may want to get out from your short and look"
"1849460","1851520"," for a new place too short above."
"1851520","1858920"," We're going to trade this live tomorrow so that we can see where areas of resistance and support"
"1858920","1859260"," are. "
"1859620","1865200"," We can usually pick out where major resistances above where the sellers are going to come on board."
"1865620","1867560"," And we're going to be open to trade this all the way up to 470."
"1868180","1870440"," We can be open to trade this all up to 480 if we need to. "
"1870960","1876080"," But my take is still ultimately currently bearish on this market."
"1876080","1882000"," And as a matter of fact, I ended up taking the same trade that these banks took."
"1882160","1889040"," I took a trade into this week being bullish with protection down to 428 being bearish into"
"1889040","1889520"," February. "
"1890620","1893640"," And I'm going to let the put spreads that I have into February."
"1894020","1896220"," I'll even let this ride up and come back down."
"1896220","1897460"," I'm not going to sell those. "
"1897740","1900660"," I'm going to hold those and if I have to let them burn, if I have to, if we keep"
"1900660","1901400"," trading up here."
"1902260","1903900"," But I don't think we're done yet."
"1903900","1906300"," I don't think that you should think that we're done yet. "
"1906740","1909680"," I don't think that you should panic sell if you're up here already."
"1910400","1911120"," Your position."
"1911400","1914220"," If anything, you can add to them as we continue to trade down. "
"1914700","1920700"," And I'm going to be looking for the next price target down here somewhere between 4, 28, 0, 4, 26,"
"1920900","1921320"," 0."
"1921560","1925680"," And even if we don't sell this market, I'm going to look for a retest down below here to close"
"1925680","1930340"," this gap and potentially make a tag down below at 4, 26, 4, 28."
"1930680","1932540"," And ultimately, I don't think it's low enough."
"1932540","1935420"," Ultimately, I think we do need to trade down into this area. "
"1935800","1937360"," I think you look at companies like Amazon."
"1938080","1939720"," I think you look at companies like Tesla."
"1940280","1943760"," I think you look at companies like Shopify specifically, right?"
"1944180","1948780"," Shopify and Amazon have big, giant areas that they need to come down. "
"1948900","1950100"," They have not come down yet."
"1950480","1955800"," You might see other parts of the market participate in recovery before you see that happen."
"1956380","1959660"," But I'm looking at these companies and I'm like, I can't buy them. "
"1960040","1962420"," I can't buy them."
"1963500","1968180"," Currently, where they're at, they need to have some form of another takedown."
"1968960","1974260"," And I'm going to expect and anticipate that to happen in the next two weeks that you're going to"
"1974260","1974520"," see. "
"1975840","1980040"," Even if they have great ERs and let's say they stay up for a week or two, you guys all"
"1980040","1985740"," know, even when we have great ERs and we're all and we're bullish on the rest of the season, we"
"1985740","1986980"," know that profits are taken."
"1987680","1989940"," We know this happens in the past."
"1989940","1992140"," We've never had these other things on our plate. "
"1992720","1994740"," So that couple, let's say we have great earnings."
"1995260","1998080"," Let's say we even have decent guidance, which I don't think we're going to get."
"1998940","2000040"," Let's just say we did. "
"2000180","2002140"," Let's say a great earnings, great guidance."
"2003300","2005360"," Let's say somebody pulls a golden egg out of their ass."
"2006040","2010000"," Even in a good time, we know that those companies still take profit. "
"2010620","2012620"," They took profit in 2020, all 2020."
"2013240","2015620"," Whenever they went up, they took profit in 2021."
"2016860","2022400"," So no matter what, I still see us coming down to this 404 area somewhere in here, more than likely. "
"2023660","2024880"," No less than the 428."
"2026320","2027540"," This was my last target."
"2028140","2030300"," And now I'm opening us up to at least four. "
"2030680","2037640"," I think I think we're open now down somewhere down minimum, closer to four, zero, six, four, zero,"
"2037980","2038100"," four."
"2038680","2039820"," I think that's on the table."
"2040500","2043640"," I think even if it's just a retest, make sure this is where we want to go. "
"2043640","2047860"," You guys know how we trade in these zones and the banks."
"2048060","2049920"," Let's say we are going up at some point."
"2050040","2051400"," Let's say we start trading down in here. "
"2051820","2057380"," There's always that moment where we trade outside of a trading area, right?"
"2057880","2062360"," Or we end up trading down in a capitulation move so that they can get the best price."
"2063920","2067380"," Let's say we trade down here without this kind of a thing going on."
"2068020","2072760"," It wouldn't shock me to see him trade us down here briefly just to get that ultimate I'm in before"
"2072760","2073040"," you. "
"2073040","2074760"," They love being in before you."
"2075280","2079360"," The banks like being in before anybody so that they can always have an out before you do."
"2079820","2080980"," Just be conscious of that. "
"2081340","2087960"," Be conscious of what bulls say if you're a bear and you get scared that we're going to take this"
"2087960","2088500"," market along."
"2089060","2090659"," Be conscious of what bulls think."
"2090800","2093179"," I'm a bull and I don't like buying this market here. "
"2093320","2094400"," I don't like buying it down here."
"2094860","2097560"," I do think right now we do have a bottom in this market."
"2098140","2101580"," We would have to see for us to not have a bottom in this market. "
"2101580","2103720"," You are going to have to see something like this."
"2103720","2104360"," Excuse me."
"2106260","2108820"," If I think for a moment we're going to have a market crash. "
"2109480","2115200"," You are going to see a move like this off of one of our big pullbacks."
"2115460","2121540"," You'll see like a 10-15% move and then you will see a straight down another 15-20%."
"2121540","2127160"," You will see a 25-30% basic straight down correction. "
"2127160","2134800"," If you see that move then that is going to want this or multiple months and a quarter in the"
"2134800","2135020"," red."
"2135360","2141260"," Either of those will signify some real damage done to the structure of our market."
"2141780","2144920"," Something going on in the mechanics of our market behind our market. "
"2145720","2147300"," I'm looking for these."
"2147460","2149720"," These can certainly happen at any moment."
"2149720","2158520"," But for right now, the only thing the market is showing me is that, and what the banks are showing,"
"2158780","2161100"," because this is the information age, right?"
"2161620","2164760"," The banks are showing that they are open to a move up, some kind of a snapback. "
"2165760","2167980"," They've definitely got some downside protection."
"2168620","2172780"," Our put wall, our absolute gamma strike is now somewhere down around 4,200."
"2173280","2175140"," I don't know what Spock is going to tell you in the morning. "
"2175140","2181320"," But I'm sure then ship positively sure that we had major puts coming in, wall harp hedging coming"
"2181320","2184060"," in down to 4,20 on Friday."
"2184680","2190760"," And we definitely had call structure coming in to go higher, dated for an expiration of this"
"2190760","2191100"," Friday."
"2191980","2197140"," There were millions of dollars that came into the market at the end of the day yesterday between 4,"
"2197380","2204220"," 10 and 4, 15 PM, millions in call strikes expiring this Friday. "
"2204220","2206640"," So I think that they're trading this up."
"2206900","2208480"," They want to run this up real quick."
"2208980","2210400"," They're going to trade this snapback. "
"2210620","2213120"," And then we're going to keep trading this stuff down over here."
"2213440","2219100"," And I doubt that even J-PAL gets that aggressive in this Fed meeting."
"2219620","2221740"," I think he is going to be quiet. "
"2222040","2224700"," I don't think you're going to get the nasty talk until March."
"2224980","2226720"," You might get it in this Fed meeting."
"2227600","2231240"," But I think he's going to like to see that the market is correcting. "
"2231240","2238460"," And he's going to let it continue to correct this because this is more orderly than it should be."
"2239200","2245020"," And so if he was to become hawkish in the Fed meeting, it could trigger market crash."
"2245380","2247560"," I don't think he's looking for that market crash. "
"2248500","2257600"," So on the outside tail risk, I don't leave the tail risk to J-PAL creating it because the market's"
"2257600","2258260"," already doing it."
"2258260","2266360"," I think that the tail risk comes from panic from retail and small hedge funds."
"2266760","2273700"," I think that retail, small hedge funds, I think like Kathy Woods, people like that could create it. "
"2274180","2276860"," I think that wealthy individuals could start it."
"2277760","2280420"," I think that's where the real tail risk is."
"2281180","2289780"," And if anything, he might try to sue the markets for the next couple of weeks to stop those people"
"2289780","2295540"," in hedge funds from selling out of their positions and they maybe get super hawkish come March. "
"2296440","2298600"," So I'm not a buyer of this market right now."
"2299380","2304480"," And I won't be a buyer of this market right now until probably March."
"2305100","2312360"," Normally when we do moves like this, even if we don't do a second check now, you'll still see one"
"2312360","2313140"," between now and March. "
"2313140","2319020"," So at some point to expect to see these levels at least one time, at least one more time."
"2319300","2322040"," Almost always happens, like 95% of the time it happens."
"2322860","2327940"," So the real tail risk this market is is market panic in my view. "
"2329380","2334540"," So one other thing I want to talk to you guys about is I heard one reoccurring theme this weekend"
"2334540","2336380"," on YouTube channels."
"2336540","2340820"," I don't normally do this, I stopped watching YouTube channels months ago because I didn't want to"
"2340820","2346460"," get sucked in to thinking like other people wanted to have my own take on the market."
"2346880","2349800"," And you guys got my take on the market by Friday, you guys knew my take. "
"2350140","2352860"," So my take hasn't changed at this point."
"2353240","2355680"," Nothing has changed this, but I want to bring up something that's important."
"2356520","2364500"," And that is that I consistently heard people say you can't time tops, you can't time bottoms that"
"2364500","2368380"," you might time one aspect, but not the other. "
"2369020","2370500"," That is not fucking true."
"2371280","2373220"," You can easily time tops in this market."
"2373920","2376320"," If you've been in this market long enough, you can time them. "
"2376660","2379380"," You can see everything stacking up for those things."
"2379760","2381580"," And you can see when to buy the bottoms."
"2382280","2384660"," But to their point, they were making this weekend. "
"2385420","2391040"," Well, the market then shot up and they lost that on all those losses by selling down or whatever."
"2391460","2395100"," Even when that happens, even when, let's say we rock it up here to 480."
"2395720","2397160"," So let me bring this a little bit smaller here. "
"2397960","2403000"," I want to say this to you because there was a lot of soothing talk done to bulls this weekend."
"2403140","2410800"," It kind of pissed me off because let's say you did sell out of this market and you're waiting like"
"2410800","2413580"," me, Kevin's waiting or whatever, even so."
"2414980","2422520"," And they say, well, well, then what they what they did was the market wound up trading up and they"
"2422520","2423720"," lost all this money. "
"2425460","2432220"," Even when we trade up like this, typically, typically, like March, you'll see this move might take"
"2432220","2433640"," till June, you'll see this move."
"2434080","2440560"," So even if even if we come up here and even if you sold up here above and you miss"
"2440560","2445880"," this move and you're just day trading it or I don't know, weeklies or whatever, and you're making"
"2445880","2447720"," money and you're still pissed off."
"2447720","2453820"," You didn't buy a fucking Tesla at these levels or whatever, whatever stock it is, Netflix down here"
"2453820","2454080"," or whatever. "
"2454860","2460520"," Dude, if you look back in history, we always come back town to retest every single time and"
"2460520","2461920"," especially with a move like this."
"2462320","2465660"," When you see a move like this, this is rare for us to see a move like this."
"2466160","2470560"," When we see moves like this, we almost always come back to check one more time. "
"2471100","2473500"," This is this is damage that was done to our market."
"2474140","2475400"," There's no doubt about it."
"2475400","2477920"," There's no way to argue that it wasn't. "
"2478300","2480580"," This isn't your normal monthly OPEX pullback."
"2481320","2488900"," And I suspect that it's going to continue at least once more at a minimum and possibly even deeper."
"2489600","2491860"," Nothing here is bullish in this market at this point. "
"2492940","2497400"," So I need you guys to all understand that and that I would expect another retest down below."
"2497840","2501400"," If anything, if you guys wanted a hard number, I'm going to go with the banks."
"2501400","2505160"," The banks are saying is that we come up once more, right?"
"2506040","2510460"," And they're going to hold this probably into Tuesday or Friday, Wednesday, maybe. "
"2510860","2513240"," And then we're going to trade this back down over here at some point."
"2513780","2514100"," Okay."
"2514380","2515940"," Maybe there'll be some fair heading into the Fed. "
"2516340","2517620"," We trade it down one more time."
"2517980","2522540"," We do the second retest and then we start to take this higher or sideways for a little while."
"2523720","2527900"," Maybe we trade this sideways into March and down. "
"2527900","2532740"," And then once March Fed comes, we'll make a decision there if we're going to continue down."
"2532940","2538000"," We could do it, continue down all your long sideways, all your long, and then do a nice pop up"
"2538000","2540860"," for Christmas time, holiday time, or whatever."
"2541420","2544540"," I just don't see this move above and I don't see the market crash yet. "
"2545040","2550740"," I got to see like, I want to see more information before we're claiming market crash here."
"2551340","2555480"," Now with that all being said, I do want to have one last conversation with you tonight."
"2555480","2559160"," And that has to do with some companies out there that you all love. "
"2559880","2563080"," I spent this weekend researching more stocks."
"2564320","2570900"," And when I was researching more stocks this weekend, I came upon a lot of stocks from that were big"
"2570900","2576720"," pump stocks from 2020 that were not pumped this year in 2021."
"2576720","2583360"," Now we're heading into 2022 and some of those stocks, like these are stocks that were big into"
"2583360","2583740"," 2020. "
"2585320","2590980"," And then they went out of favor and they went down from, let's say, highs of a hundred bucks down"
"2590980","2595320"," to lows of 10, 15, 20, like hoods out right now."
"2595960","2598860"," And some of those stocks never actually came back in 2021."
"2599260","2600940"," They just went from like 10, 15 bucks. "
"2600940","2609680"," They went down to two, three bucks, $2, $3, $1.50, $3.25. So you and I need to"
"2609680","2615600"," be wary when we are picking stocks for the rest of 2022."
"2616440","2618340"," Which ones actually are coming back?"
"2619080","2624820"," Which ones have the chance of being absorbed by another company because the price will go up there,"
"2625420","2625580"," right?"
"2626220","2632180"," You see like a fly.com have a deal or like a PayPal has a chance to come back or"
"2632180","2634500"," square can come back or find a new deal."
"2635360","2639000"," We have to look at tech companies that did not trade. "
"2639400","2641720"," I don't have I don't know if I can see them over here."
"2641860","2643800"," Maybe I have one for the other day I looked at."
"2644540","2645100"," That's hidden. "
"2645700","2647260"," It was one that I was looking at the other day."
"2648220","2655540"," There's some big tech that hasn't been up in the past in the past year or two."
"2655540","2659420"," But there hasn't been anything in the 2020 trade for COVID and they're big tech stocks. "
"2660000","2662380"," But they still haven't come down quite where they need to be."
"2662860","2668420"," But we need to be buying quality companies as we head into the rest of 2022, even if we come"
"2668420","2668580"," up."
"2668940","2670460"," Some of these companies like Peton. "
"2671540","2672880"," They aren't ever coming back."
"2673600","2677040"," There are companies like I looked at ride this weekend."
"2677560","2678540"," I looked at it. "
"2678740","2682420"," You know, these are just these companies that they're never coming back."
"2683100","2686700"," The badge is worth being absorbed by another company, but that's about it."
"2687400","2692740"," And so be conscious of what's been pumped this year, what's been pumped for the last two years,"
"2693520","2698200"," what's being told that they're going to come back in 2022 and start to. "
"2699500","2703560"," You know, the one thing I got to give me Kevin is it has to be a lot of weight"
"2703560","2704380"," off his shoulders."
"2705140","2712840"," He's able to take a breather, sit back and not be locked into a bunch of these companies."
"2713220","2714720"," He's not sitting on SQs. "
"2715080","2716540"," He's not sitting on hoods."
"2716640","2719320"," He's not sitting on a lot of these companies."
"2719540","2726160"," He can sit back now and he can make the decisions as to what he's buying from scratch, right?"
"2726420","2732500"," And so let's say a guy like that starts to pump new stocks and you're not in those stocks with"
"2732500","2732700"," him. "
"2733460","2738380"," Not you personally, the people that listen to this broadcast, but think about that for a minute"
"2738380","2744220"," because you do have retail traders out there that love to fall in love with a stock."
"2746160","2752040"," And the guy like him has power and influence over these markets in retail, like it or not, believe"
"2752040","2752900"," it or not, he does."
"2753640","2759540"," And when a guy like that pulls out of all of his positions, it's nothing to say, yeah, you know"
"2759540","2761980"," what, so fine, maybe it isn't the best company. "
"2763160","2765560"," Qcom, maybe I'm not going to invest in Qcom."
"2765920","2768180"," A firm, you know, I'm not saying these are bad companies."
"2768460","2772560"," I'm just saying that there will be waves felt from that kind of move. "
"2772960","2775080"," There are a lot of stock pumpers out there."
"2775740","2781000"," I'm sure that are panicking this weekend and know that they're going to have to adjust to him, but"
"2781000","2786040"," they're going to say, shit, mine the wrong basket of stocks and bag holding the wrong basket of"
"2786040","2786280"," stocks."
"2786860","2793540"," And if anything, there's a lot of us in this trading group that were long stocks and we feel great,"
"2793880","2799000"," like we don't feel like we're beholden to the whims of this market right now. "
"2799380","2802120"," And we're just sitting back saying, when's our time to buy?"
"2803060","2803920"," And what are we buying?"
"2804720","2806740"," You know, we have all the time on our sides right now."
"2807000","2811520"," We have all the time to decide what we're going long in for 2022 and beyond."
"2812440","2817420"," We're not locked into, you know, I always constantly have to pump up. "
"2817940","2819080"," You know, you pick it, right?"
"2819340","2820760"," You pick the stock ride."
"2821100","2823980"," Am I locked in having to pick up a pump ride anymore?"
"2824220","2824380"," No."
"2825100","2829860"," And so when you see guys like that doing stuff like that, they are going to impact any of you"
"2829860","2830680"," that are long out there. "
"2830860","2835580"," Any of you that are bag holding out there right now in these stocks, a lot of these guys have"
"2835580","2839900"," made themselves liquid to make new choices."
"2840500","2845880"," And I bet a lot of these guys don't go back into the stocks that they were in prior to"
"2845880","2846560"," this past week."
"2846900","2847900"," And I give him a lot of respect. "
"2848020","2848620"," I'm going to say that."
"2849060","2850820"," I give me Kevin a lot of respect."
"2851000","2852460"," I used to trash him and rip on him a lot. "
"2852720","2856100"," And I sometimes poke fun at him, but I got to give that guy a lot of respect."
"2856260","2859480"," He was able to even at the last moment."
"2860640","2867400"," Even at the last moment, he was able to get out from the potential of burning down his house,"
"2867600","2867720"," right?"
"2868420","2873900"," Something that Kathy Woods has somewhat the ability to do, but hasn't shown yet that she's done"
"2873900","2874140"," that. "
"2874820","2876980"," And a lot of these long hedge funds have to."
"2877380","2882920"," A lot of these long hedge funds are going to try to pump this market air to unfuck themselves into"
"2882920","2885140"," the next two months or so."
"2886060","2890360"," So they can come back and not get burned and come back with new companies. "
"2891140","2891940"," That's what they're going to do."
"2892500","2899320"," And the first crack of that happening was me, Kevin, being honest about it."
"2899620","2900240"," So I give him respect. "
"2900800","2901540"," I got to give him respect."
"2901740","2902400"," I don't normally do."
"2902820","2905440"," I don't normally like those people, but I like that of all of them. "
"2905960","2906700"," He said something."
"2908600","2909480"," How are you all doing?"
"2911180","2913620"," Let me stop up here and talk to you guys."
"2915880","2917220"," How about value stocks?"
"2917480","2922880"," That's a great question because some hedge funds this weekend were pumping up value stocks. "
"2923540","2925080"," They were saying to buy PayPal."
"2926020","2927620"," They were saying to buy Nike."
"2928560","2930480"," They were saying to buy a bunch of different tickers, right?"
"2930560","2932000"," I got a list somewhere of what they were saying. "
"2932480","2933920"," And you know what I did this weekend?"
"2934180","2936060"," I'm going to tell you what I did this weekend."
"2937180","2940540"," I fucking went and found all these hedge funds."
"2940620","2941940"," These are small hedge funds, right?"
"2942120","2943460"," They got the cute names and all that shit. "
"2944880","2946520"," They were all over CNBC and Friday."
"2946520","2951200"," I went back and I found out all these companies, all these small family offices."
"2952040","2952700"," They were long. "
"2953280","2956040"," All these stocks back in November, December."
"2957700","2960900"," And they just got the rug pulled from underneath them."
"2962740","2966380"," And so I did just did some basic digging research in these companies. "
"2966680","2968980"," And so I think they do try to run this up."
"2969080","2972880"," I think they do try to run this up to unfuck themselves in this time frame."
"2972880","2976640"," So anything that anybody is telling you right now, because I heard this still, I heard this this"
"2976640","2976880"," weekend. "
"2977040","2979640"," I heard this, well, buy five value stocks right now."
"2979820","2981200"," These guys are already in value stocks."
"2981720","2984220"," These guys are going to try to hand their bags off to you. "
"2984960","2990100"," Then they're going to join the ranks of selling this market down into March and April in my view."
"2991420","2993440"," I don't want that to be your view."
"2994720","2995660"," But I went back. "
"2996440","2998020"," I spent like six hours."
"2999520","3001340"," I like two, three in the morning."
"3002000","3004460"," I woke up on Saturday and we went skiing too, right?"
"3004640","3009480"," And I went back woke up and I literally went back through got all these people's names. "
"3009960","3013080"," And sure enough, they've been long in these companies."
"3013900","3015620"," They were calling for PayPal to 240."
"3016020","3018400"," That was one of a key company that was pumped. "
"3019340","3024640"," These are the S&P value 500 SPV, SPYV, I think it's called."
"3025380","3031820"," That there's 10 to 30 stocks that are within that are held in growth, but also in value."
"3032340","3035820"," If you guys know anything about this stuff out there, I see a couple comments about it. "
"3036200","3037500"," Be very wary of this."
"3038140","3042980"," This is a way for big time bag holders to get out from underneath their bags."
"3043860","3046820"," And for once, I'm going to give you some advice if you're a bull. "
"3048160","3049520"," Look towards me, Kevin."
"3050320","3054200"," That guy had a ton of weight lifted off his shoulders."
"3055120","3061700"," And when you hear some of his pairs out there say shit like, what if he misses it?"
"3062400","3063500"," He's not missing nothing. "
"3064300","3065400"," He's not missing anything."
"3065700","3067300"," That guy's got a weight lifted off his shoulders."
"3068000","3072400"," He's able to participate in bringing the market back where it should be. "
"3073160","3078300"," And he has the ability to pick a new basket of what he wants to go long in."
"3078300","3080660"," That guy has so much weight lifted off his shoulders."
"3081100","3082480"," He probably smoked a fat cigarette. "
"3082700","3085560"," It was probably the best sex he's had in two years."
"3086180","3091440"," The stress that you must have, or investing in this market, has a bull."
"3091660","3092280"," It's high. "
"3092740","3095700"," Not being a trader or being an investor is not an easy job."
"3098680","3098940"," All right."
"3099100","3104220"," Something to scroll up and see what you guys are saying here because one more thing. "
"3104460","3105200"," I've got a list here."
"3105200","3109240"," I want to talk to you guys about a couple of things here."
"3110200","3115600"," So on the YouTube channel, I can see some of you guys that are tipping, but some of you guys"
"3115600","3119020"," go direct to the Twitter handle and tip there because you don't want to tip through PayPal. "
"3119600","3120660"," You want to do a direct tip."
"3121040","3121880"," I want to thank you guys."
"3122260","3123140"," Thank you, Henry A."
"3123580","3124660"," Thank you, Jason F."
"3124940","3125700"," Thank you, Kyle B."
"3126080","3127120"," Thank you, Matthew Henn. "
"3127460","3128420"," Thank you, Mary G."
"3129180","3131980"," Thank you, FM Partners Trading of California."
"3134420","3135840"," Thank you, Eric Graper."
"3136040","3137660"," Oh, wait, but these are all from back in January. "
"3138140","3139720"," It's only been three, two."
"3140200","3144160"," So I've only had two people that donate on PayPal on Twitter."
"3144680","3146740"," I want to say a special thank you to Henry A."
"3146980","3147520"," and Jason F."
"3148520","3148920"," Okay. "
"3148980","3149620"," Let's take a look here."
"3149980","3154060"," Now for the one people that donated on Twitter or excuse me on YouTube."
"3154720","3155720"," Thank you, Dan Cornish. "
"3156380","3157860"," Thank you, Visha 89."
"3159000","3160660"," And that's it for tonight."
"3160660","3164500"," Okay, so I want to say thank you to all of you for believing in me. "
"3164980","3169480"," I want to thank you guys for taking the time out of your days to trade alongside me."
"3170120","3171180"," I am an investor."
"3171580","3174580"," If you're an investor, stick around. "
"3175080","3179740"," If you're a swing trader or if you're a month, a three month trader or an investor's trader, swing"
"3179740","3180800"," trader, whatever, stick around."
"3181280","3185160"," This is still a trader's market that we have not found the bottom of the buy yet."
"3185640","3189720"," I'll be right there with you buying this bottom with you as for right now. "
"3190580","3192060"," We can trade these rips."
"3192800","3198680"," I'll be actively trading these rips and I'll also be actively trading the cells, right?"
"3198840","3201700"," The seller rips and I don't think we're done with selling the rip."
"3202020","3204300"," So stick tight. "
"3204680","3208020"," There's a lot of money to be made right now in this market."
"3208680","3213400"," This is some of the best money making that's happened in this market in some time."
"3214380","3217700"," If you're a new trader, if you're new to this channel, paper traded, if you have to. "
"3218640","3219700"," It's great experience."
"3225610","3226750"," Who's this guy, me, Kevin?"
"3228190","3229930"," I think it's just the real me, Kevin."
"3230110","3230590"," I think it's him. "
"3231370","3232450"," A lot of you will follow him."
"3234790","3236570"," Good job going down the rabbit hole screening."
"3236630","3240870"," Also, I'm going to put some Finviz screeners up for you guys on Twitter. "
"3241370","3245970"," I'll try to get those up tonight so you guys can actually see when the turn happens."
"3246950","3248410"," I want to talk to you guys about that too."
"3248410","3249970"," That's a good point, your wife's boyfriend. "
"3250610","3256990"," So I have screeners that can tell when the banks are pushing a stock up right now and none of"
"3256990","3259410"," my screeners yet have turned around."
"3259930","3260710"," Not a single one."
"3261050","3265750"," Not a single one of my screeners are showing a buy anywhere in this market. "
"3266050","3271210"," So be conscious of that the moment that tickers do show up on my screener."
"3271690","3272950"," I'll pass them along to you."
"3273350","3278210"," I'll even show you guys how to do your own screeners so you can know when to buy dips. "
"3278210","3280330"," Or to start investing again."
"3283530","3285730"," The last wrap up with key levels."
"3286510","3287570"," Hey, hell of shit. "
"3289270","3290990"," You guys are talking about football in here."
"3293590","3294230"," Now, China."
"3294590","3295730"," Let's talk about China real quick. "
"3297090","3298330"," We're going to talk about a few things."
"3299030","3300270"," XPI is not done."
"3302910","3304810"," Yeah, so I will say this. "
"3305050","3305790"," Alex is saying this."
"3305890","3308550"," Lots of guys selling out portfolios going cash on YouTube."
"3309790","3313330"," And people, you know, people say, well, that's a sign that this is the bottom. "
"3314450","3317770"," You know, put all that stuff aside for a minute."
"3318190","3320830"," You're going to see more capitulation than just them."
"3321670","3324850"," Right now you've got some very serious players in this game. "
"3325130","3326050"," Not me, Kevin's out there."
"3326130","3327650"," I'm talking about some serious hedge funds."
"3328270","3329730"," And they have not sold out yet. "
"3330330","3332450"," And they are looking for their opportunity to sell out."
"3332830","3334330"," And they will wait for it."
"3334450","3337810"," If they have to, they'll buy this market to sell out of this market. "
"3342080","3343460"," I'll play them on both sides."
"3346920","3347600"," Activist, investor."
"3348800","3350500"," Let me get a sip of this whiskey here. "
"3351060","3352740"," Cheers to all of you out there, by the way."
"3353320","3354360"," Hope you had a great weekend."
"3360700","3361880"," Let's see what you guys are saying here. "
"3363400","3364080"," It is inevitable."
"3364440","3364880"," It goes lower."
"3365500","3366240"," It's not inevitable. "
"3366860","3368440"," You know, it's inevitable that we."
"3369400","3372560"," It's inevitable that we retest, even if we did a V shape recovery."
"3372560","3374960"," It's inevitable that we retest. "
"3375320","3380020"," And we haven't had the only confirmation that I can tell you that we've had right now."
"3380120","3381480"," You guys wanted some confirmations."
"3382660","3383220"," Right?"
"3383420","3384400"," I'll give you some confirmations. "
"3385400","3393680"," If we don't close above 480, 03.25 on February 1, right?"
"3394520","3395280"," That's a red month."
"3396980","3401120"," We've had red weeks stacked in stacked all of January."
"3401120","3401800"," Okay?"
"3402300","3404700"," We barely close green, I believe, on December. "
"3405380","3406260"," See this right here?"
"3407240","3408400"," See this back here?"
"3409060","3410600"," December 28, right?"
"3410900","3414300"," December 29, 31, was 31, right here."
"3415200","3415900"," We close green."
"3417180","3419280"," If we don't see that move up, right?"
"3420060","3423120"," We're now stacking red weeks upon a red month. "
"3423880","3425240"," We stack a red month, right?"
"3426050","3432100"," The anticipation is going to be that we close red for the month of February."
"3432720","3437580"," And if we close red the month of January and February, this is a very serious topic."
"3438220","3440920"," You will see a red quarter. "
"3441840","3444940"," And you don't recover this easily from this move down."
"3445140","3451560"," If we had stopped coming down somewhere above here like 450, possibly 460, it wouldn't say it was"
"3451560","3452040"," so bad."
"3452040","3459280"," But when we broke this here, we broke through that right there, right?"
"3459460","3460000"," This was bad. "
"3460660","3463120"," When we came back up and failed, this was worse."
"3464060","3465920"," This is not a good look here."
"3467600","3474540"," And so my point to you is, as we start to add this stuff up, to recover from this is"
"3474540","3475400"," going to take some time. "
"3476060","3480100"," And if we continue to confirm lower levels, we will continue to go down."
"3482400","3483560"," Let me what else you got there."
"3483800","3489100"," Activist, investor of Blackwell's aims to call Peloton to fire a CEO, explore the sale of the"
"3489100","3489320"," company. "
"3489600","3490240"," I agree with that."
"3490840","3491620"," I've got some puts."
"3492220","3493080"," I've got puts, brother. "
"3493380","3494500"," I've got my Peton puts."
"3495540","3497160"," I fucking diamond-hand on those things."
"3498040","3498700"," That's just insane. "
"3499340","3501320"," The Peton thing is insane."
"3501580","3502360"," We've seen this before."
"3503540","3504400"," I'll play the ramps up. "
"3504540","3504960"," Yes, I will."
"3506200","3507000"," Hey, Jordan's for sale."
"3507700","3507980"," It's stacked. "
"3507980","3508360"," Cheddar."
"3508380","3509060"," Good to see you, brother."
"3510920","3511740"," Good to see you, man. "
"3513260","3516140"," Lots of guys selling up portfolios, short strength, bi-weakness."
"3516320","3516500"," Howdy."
"3516660","3517020"," Hey, Patrick. "
"3517480","3518100"," Good to see you, brother."
"3521660","3522460"," Always retest."
"3523460","3524780"," No, it's always retest. "
"3524900","3525460"," That's a good point."
"3525640","3526800"," Let's talk about that for a minute."
"3528280","3530840"," Let's talk about what I got is saying. "
"3531620","3537000"," So I got saying, we never retested the 08 lows or the COVID lows."
"3537700","3539920"," And we're going to talk about that briefly, okay?"
"3540160","3542240"," I'm going to show you two instances where we actually did."
"3543060","3547260"," I don't think I'm going to get you guys on an 08 chart here real quick. "
"3547800","3549840"," But there are some points here to be made."
"3550260","3554080"," Number one, see this move down here, right?"
"3555180","3561860"," You won't retest this move here down if we drop another 15, 20%."
"3561860","3565280"," I wouldn't expect another retest lower. "
"3565280","3569580"," And if anything, I would retest us, I would consider us to continue to head lower."
"3570040","3578000"," Also, in 2008, I think you saw the retest in 2008 was the retest of 2007."
"3578780","3583600"," I have a previous video where I showed those retests that span actual years. "
"3584200","3591520"," When you trade down like 2008, you actually were retesting a previous low from a year before."
"3592080","3593580"," So it was even more devastating."
"3593580","3595540"," I think it was 2007. "
"3595720","3597440"," But I'll post those on Twitter."
"3597840","3599140"," I'm not going to go back and do them right now."
"3599180","3600920"," It's going to be like 15 minutes to show that retest. "
"3601360","3602920"," But we do end up retesting."
"3603640","3605540"," And you will see a retest here."
"3605660","3606260"," I promise you. "
"3606660","3609960"," I made a video about this, I think, last Sunday."
"3610520","3615740"," I made a video showing all the way back, I think, to 2007 or 2008."
"3615740","3618340"," If I didn't make that video, I will make that video. "
"3618440","3621560"," But I'm almost positive I made that video showing the retest down below."
"3621560","3626880"," I'll make a short one so you guys can see where these retests take place."
"3627280","3630920"," The bigger the move down here, we will get a bigger move higher. "
"3631420","3637820"," But we eventually always, and depending upon the scale of this move, let's say we traded down the"
"3637820","3642520"," entire year here, you would see the following year another retest down below, believe it or not."
"3645200","3646040"," I'll have XBI."
"3646320","3647980"," XBI, I don't know what to say to you guys. "
"3647980","3655820"," The only thing you can bring up to about XBI is look back towards the first time biotech had a"
"3655820","3664220"," run and compare by the first time biotech was made a huge run was, I believe, 0708, and they were"
"3664220","3664620"," devastated."
"3665600","3669700"," They were part of the first tech boom, and they got utterly destroyed."
"3670500","3675100"," And the newest XBI run reminds me a lot of the marijuana run, right?"
"3675100","3677980"," I was trading marijuana four, five, six years ago. "
"3678380","3679540"," It might be six years now."
"3680120","3684100"," I was trading marijuana stocks, and then a couple of years ago when marijuana stocks came back"
"3684100","3686000"," again, all I did was shutter."
"3686820","3694140"," Because I was in the first marijuana stock ramp, and it sounded like the same old story, and it's"
"3694140","3699260"," to me very similar, the marijuana story and the biotech story. "
"3700120","3701740"," And I'm pro biotech."
"3702200","3710440"," I'm pro ArcG, but I always look at it from the perspective of greedy banks."
"3711220","3713380"," And banks don't care how good your story is. "
"3713760","3715000"," They only care about profits."
"3715380","3720520"," So they'll run up stock or an index, and then they're going to do a distribution method, right?"
"3720700","3724820"," I'll wick off, and they're going to take their profits from their original trades."
"3725380","3727700"," They don't just make companies go bigger typically. "
"3727700","3729700"," It's the rare outlier."
"3730560","3731560"," It's the Amazon's."
"3731680","3737880"," It's the Apple's maybe Tesla at some point, but it's not by small biotech companies. "
"3739140","3740440"," It's not pot stocks."
"3744220","3745340"," Very good points."
"3745460","3746360"," How about value stocks?"
"3746680","3747460"," What about China names?"
"3747960","3748720"," The China trade. "
"3749300","3754680"," I don't typically trade the China trade, but I think I want to trade the China trade."
"3754680","3764100"," I might have changed my feelings on that because of the implications of those markets not raining"
"3764100","3764980"," in their currencies."
"3765860","3772940"," And I don't know enough at this point about I want more assuredness from the political side of it. "
"3773340","3776900"," And I want to make sure that the US banks are in on that trade fully."
"3778500","3780780"," How far does Apple and Amazon fall?"
"3781800","3782320"," Yeah."
"3782540","3787620"," Now, from the last channel where it would be Apple puts equal spy puts. "
"3787720","3788000"," Yes."
"3788220","3790660"," No, I believe the cap traded it."
"3790780","3791940"," I want to see your analysis. "
"3792680","3792900"," Yeah."
"3793140","3796380"," I'll show it to you from the past."
"3796940","3801440"," It's weird because you're on the on the on the retests. "
"3802260","3808320"," Depending on how ugly this gets, the retests get even uglier down the road."
"3808320","3810060"," They become amplified."
"3811280","3813660"," And a move like this, you're going to see a retest. "
"3813980","3815740"," It's it's a foreground conclusion."
"3817380","3818300"," Always a retest."
"3818560","3819180"," Well, not always. "
"3819380","3821280"," Let's call it 95% of the time."
"3821640","3822280"," There's a retest."
"3822740","3824960"," And as a matter of fact, let's just look at the year. "
"3826140","3826320"," Right."
"3826460","3827200"," Let's look at the year."
"3828420","3833440"," And we've retested now down to September of 2021. "
"3834080","3837500"," And we have the potential to retest down to May of 2021."
"3838520","3841700"," So yes, you'll see a retest at some point."
"3842240","3844880"," Now, do we go back and retest lows that have been retested?"
"3845040","3848340"," We can look at a five year chart here and quickly go back. "
"3848640","3850060"," You can see one right here, right?"
"3850320","3851480"," You can see a retest right here."
"3851900","3853440"," You can see another retest right here."
"3853560","3854340"," We still do go up. "
"3854600","3856600"," I know that we go up in these bad ugly years."
"3857080","3858800"," We end up retesting one, two."
"3859020","3860260"," There's three on this end here. "
"3860260","3861940"," These are capitulation moves."
"3862320","3864040"," You get one more retest right here."
"3864400","3866340"," And you'll often see these moves, right?"
"3866700","3867640"," You see one right here. "
"3867740","3868920"," You see another one right here."
"3869140","3870100"," Another one right here."
"3870180","3871520"," You'll see another one right here, right?"
"3872640","3876100"," Even on this move right here, we go back to 0708. "
"3876400","3877460"," I want to show you the retest."
"3878000","3878640"," It's right here."
"3879220","3879740"," You can see it. "
"3880760","3881260"," And boom."
"3882200","3884320"," There it is from 02, right?"
"3884860","3886680"," A full collapse down and retested."
"3887500","3888660"," This is 08, right?"
"3888860","3889280"," November of 08. "
"3889280","3892240"," Look at what we did in March of 09, okay?"
"3892520","3894940"," And even on a grander scale, we retested back here."
"3895740","3896580"," Look right here."
"3896800","3903360"," When you get another one, they oftentimes show themselves again where you're like, shit, I got"
"3903360","3903600"," this. "
"3903780","3904940"," I got the bottom right here, right?"
"3905260","3907880"," Or we come back up and come back down and say, shit, I missed it."
"3908260","3909920"," You usually have another chance, okay?"
"3910420","3911440"," You usually have some chances."
"3912220","3914660"," You're more than likely going to see another chance over here. "
"3915960","3916820"," And this move down."
"3916820","3920360"," If we come down anymore, even if we don't, when we come up, right?"
"3920800","3922820"," You're more than likely to see another move down below."
"3923180","3928380"," So if you're a long time investor, if you don't like trading options, you don't like trading"
"3928380","3933120"," futures, you don't like, you like to buy stock, or you like to buy a long out, call your out,"
"3933120","3933740"," leaps, whatever. "
"3934680","3940180"," I almost guarantee you, you're going to see another test down here between now and at the latest"
"3940180","3940660"," July."
"3941420","3946800"," If not March or sooner, you'll see another retest down below and you'll be able to take this market"
"3946800","3949260"," long and with some confidence, okay?"
"3949500","3953620"," Either the news will change, the market will change, the Fed will change, the posture."
"3954560","3958960"," What we have in front of us for news right now, we're trading this as a bear, and we're going"
"3958960","3962060"," to trade this until things are good. "
"3962480","3963680"," Remember this time down here?"
"3963860","3965080"," I remember this time down here."
"3965420","3967960"," You know what I used to tell everybody in this time period, right?"
"3968440","3968980"," Buy anywhere."
"3969320","3970960"," It's going up, right?"
"3971220","3971880"," Buy anywhere. "
"3974860","3976440"," And you can actually see it right here, right?"
"3976540","3977180"," This is June."
"3977960","3979260"," This is July, excuse me."
"3979340","3980200"," I want to show you this real quick. "
"3981120","3982000"," This is July."
"3984080","3985160"," Let's look at this one right here, right?"
"3985320","3987380"," So this is August, excuse me."
"3987640","3990460"," This is August of 2020. "
"3990460","3991340"," We traded down."
"3991460","3993500"," We traded back up another retest, right?"
"3994160","3996900"," Just want to check confirmed down below that we're going higher."
"3997380","3999680"," We didn't want to sell it down and off to the races we were. "
"4000080","4001400"," So this is a pretty common occurrence."
"4001840","4005160"," No, this is not another retest of what took place back in October."
"4005560","4007080"," We have some actual negative news. "
"4007800","4009040"," We have companies here."
"4009700","4012860"," We have bulls that have been long since March of 2020."
"4013460","4014620"," They want to take profit. "
"4015200","4016500"," They got to take some off the table."
"4016960","4018660"," They're going to take some off the table."
"4019500","4022560"," And then they'll decide if they want to take this market forward. "
"4022720","4025800"," They're going to look to see, hey, is has inflation come down?"
"4026080","4029060"," Hey, have the rate of pay for people come down?"
"4029280","4030940"," Hey, have the prices of cars come down?"
"4030940","4035480"," There's a bunch of questions that need answered in here for us to take this market long again."
"4035980","4039480"," Hey, have the banks, are the banks still loaning startups, right?"
"4039600","4043080"," We need to see money flow still to startups."
"4043280","4048520"," We want a rich guy that's like some guy that owns Goldman Sachs, right?"
"4049020","4056980"," For that company to make money, they have to loan almost free money to some smart young 20-year-old"
"4056980","4058700"," and that's smart, right?"
"4059260","4060900"," And say, OK, I'm going to give you some money. "
"4061380","4062560"," And you're going to make that money."
"4062740","4064240"," And then you're going to pay me back in fees."
"4064540","4068140"," You're going to pay me back in rates, not rates to the government. "
"4068680","4071580"," You're going to pay me back in fat in my pockets up."
"4071940","4074940"," And you're going to produce something more than you were before."
"4075480","4079800"," Now, we need that in this zone down here between now and end of summer. "
"4080220","4084920"," Or even if it takes the end of the year, we need confirmation that there's free money flowing for"
"4084920","4085380"," these startups."
"4085380","4091020"," We need to know that the banks are willing to loan money to these people, right?"
"4091240","4094120"," We need to know that the banks are willing to give a 30-year-old."
"4094240","4095620"," I mean, you guys don't want to hear this, I know. "
"4096800","4105260"," But this country is based along, you go into college, you getting a job, you getting married."
"4106080","4109319"," It doesn't matter if you're a man or woman, but this is what our tax code is based on this."
"4109620","4116040"," Our growth, our capitalism is based around you getting married or you creating some, taking a job"
"4116040","4117160"," as an engineer, let's say. "
"4117460","4121819"," Or even if you don't get married, you start up some company that's going to produce something huge."
"4122640","4125460"," And for that to happen, the banks have to give you free money."
"4125819","4129819"," Or the Fed has to give the banks free money, and the banks got to give it to you. "
"4129979","4134040"," And you have to work harder than you want to to pay all those rich guys back."
"4134600","4137040"," It's a shitty system, but that's what our system is."
"4137660","4140740"," And so we have to see that move between now and end of year. "
"4140740","4148340"," As long as we see more tightening, less free money, more taxes, we see that inflation is too high"
"4148340","4149500"," for people to spend money."
"4150120","4152500"," We're in a trading sideways zone."
"4152899","4154100"," So we're looking for better news. "
"4154880","4161040"," The banks in this time period are going to see their money slip out of their coffers, right?"
"4161460","4162800"," They don't want to see a piton collapse."
"4164060","4169020"," They don't want to see higher rates keeping people from buying houses, from people taking out"
"4169020","4169740"," business loans."
"4171140","4176840"," And if that is what's happening, they're going to take their profit here until that changes. "
"4177439","4178420"," They're going to do it."
"4179439","4180479"," They're going to lie to you."
"4180840","4184479"," They're going to take their money, and then we're going to wait until we trade down to a level"
"4185080","4189939"," where bulls feel confident buying a bottom, where the federal government feels better with"
"4189939","4195120"," inflation, where the federal government, and that's my last note on this piece of paper I've got"
"4195120","4201240"," right here, has my last point that I had was that the monetary money is always out there. "
"4201400","4203400"," QE is always out there."
"4203880","4206640"," You know, it's like what Arnold Schwarzenegger says, right?"
"4207000","4207980"," The Fed's always there."
"4208360","4213180"," And if the Fed feels as though everything is safe, the Fed will pull back rates. "
"4213780","4215940"," The Fed will start giving free money away again."
"4216420","4218440"," That is part of monetary theory."
"4218860","4225080"," And they will start to ask people that if they want to produce new goods and new services, and all"
"4225080","4227280"," this new shit, but that's not happening right now. "
"4227720","4229240"," Okay, be conscious of that."
"4229480","4230540"," That's not happening right now."
"4230760","4231900"," But that is what I see. "
"4232080","4232720"," I do see that."
"4232980","4234420"," And I do in that context."
"4234980","4240200"," I do think the Fed is going to make a more dumbish rule, and we are going to blast higher. "
"4240500","4243500"," We are going to trade up to $5.50, $6,000."
"4243880","4247540"," I do think we get there, but I think it's going to take a little bit of time in here"
"4247540","4248900"," before the greed kicks back in."
"4250020","4250420"," Okay. "
"4255380","4260100"," I pretty much only won with super cheap calls."
"4260100","4261300"," I like them 10 saying calls."
"4261720","4262200"," Hells. "
"4262340","4262500"," Yes."
"4263780","4266020"," It's the least worse system that we have tried yet."
"4266720","4268100"," There's a bunch of bots in here tonight. "
"4269620","4271960"," So, anyways, all you guys all have a wonderful evening."
"4272640","4274100"," I hope you guys had a great weekend."
"4275160","4277540"," I will be here with you tomorrow morning. "
"4278540","4279020"," Motherfucker."
"4279340","4279760"," So sorry."
"4280320","4280760"," Shit. "
"4281000","4281560"," Stop swearing Arthur."
"4281560","4284820"," I promised myself that it would stop swearing."
"4286820","4289420"," I promised myself I would stop swearing. "
"4290960","4294760"," Yeah, we're going to surf."
"4296040","4298160"," I cannot believe we're up this high right now."
"4299160","4301120"," I can't believe we're up right now. "
"4301980","4307980"," We're almost up 0.87% on Nasdaq, 0.74% on the market."
"4307980","4309980"," Don't let it go to your head."
"4311680","4312720"," Please don't. "
"4313640","4317100"," Just trade what's in front of you whether you're a bull or a bear."
"4318380","4322300"," Don't let this market get to you bullish or bearish."
"4322980","4324200"," Trade what's in front of you. "
"4324460","4327520"," Trade it with zero emotion until your shit prints."
"4328440","4333800"," And when it prints, you can remove yourself from your trades and wait for the next opportunity."
"4335040","4337300"," I can't believe how high we're trading right now. "
"4339500","4342000"," Russians are invading Ukraine and the captain's chat."
"4342600","4349020"," It was good to see today a little bit more aggressiveness from the U.S. in terms of Ukraine."
"4351860","4353040"," Oil should be up. "
"4353380","4357260"," If any of you guys have any thoughts on sorry for swearing."
"4358300","4359660"," I'm so sorry for swearing."
"4360040","4363540"," I promised myself I would stop the swearing and I am going to work on the swearing. "
"4365320","4367160"," For myself, I shouldn't be swearing like that."
"4367400","4369640"," If my kids were here right now, I wouldn't be swearing in front of them."
"4372900","4375660"," So trade what's in front of you in the next coming days. "
"4377460","4379180"," This is really not a high snapback."
"4380020","4381100"," But be careful out there."
"4381160","4381580"," I'm telling you. "
"4381680","4383320"," We're going to trade this up in tomorrow."
"4384240","4386740"," We're more than likely going to hit us up while at some point."
"4386880","4389400"," We're going to start trading sideways waiting for everybody to put out there. "
"4391240","4391760"," ERs."
"4391840","4396360"," It wouldn't even be shocking to see the markets stay up for all these ERs."
"4397260","4399740"," And then right at the last one happens, rug pull. "
"4400980","4401700"," All right."
"4404040","4406020"," Please like and subscribe these videos."
"4406300","4410540"," Please leave a please leave a tip if you can help support them. "
"4411360","4414900"," I will see David say likes to hit the kids around."
"4415320","4419200"," If anyone has any information on the China trade."
"4419200","4421340"," It's a big trade coming down the pike. "
"4421380","4423560"," I want you guys to know that emerging markets."
"4424440","4430540"," The talk before was that they'll have it'll take a year for emerging markets to really print hard"
"4430540","4430920"," and heavy."
"4431640","4438680"," But the fact that some of these emerging markets are not following our lead with monetary policy is"
"4438680","4444380"," going to lead to a lowering of our inflation in the U.S. It's going to give us cheap goods"
"4444380","4444760"," again. "
"4444760","4449060"," But it's also going to bring huge profits for these companies."
"4449580","4451680"," And let me relate it to you like this briefly."
"4452640","4458720"," If I sell a KitKat bar here in the United States and I sell it for a dollar and I"
"4458720","4460000"," make 50 cents, right?"
"4460460","4462220"," I'm a happy guy making 50 cents. "
"4462700","4471960"," If I take that same KitKat bar and I sell it in Canada and I'm only able to sell it"
"4471960","4474900"," for a dollar in Canada."
"4475540","4477980"," But the exchange rate is only 50 cents."
"4478240","4479820"," It's a break even loss for me. "
"4480200","4484640"," Now if I can sell it in Canada for two bucks, right?"
"4484940","4487860"," I'm going to make 150% profit."
"4488160","4488780"," Does that make sense?"
"4489600","4495240"," So there could be a huge trade in emerging markets until they change their monetary policy."
"4495880","4497760"," And of course the oil trade is still on. "
"4500760","4501900"," Great radio voice."
"4502320","4505120"," You know what's funny is I used to work."
"4505860","4509240"," My profession put me around a lot of Hollywood. "
"4511080","4516080"," And I used to get asked if I wanted to do audio books or a radio show frequently."
"4516600","4517720"," And I always said no."
"4518920","4523640"," And I never thought that I'd be here doing this with you folks out there. "
"4523800","4527140"," So I guess to some extent they were right."
"4527940","4529340"," Even if the show sucks."
"4533880","4535300"," March 380 is level. "
"4535680","4537100"," I can sold puts back in November."
"4537580","4538280"," Yes, that's right."
"4538760","4540020"," You guys didn't forget that. "
"4540180","4540440"," Did you?"
"4540740","4542520"," It was March 3800."
"4542620","4543200"," Troy remembers."
"4545880","4548120"," Yeah, we got to look at that China trade. "
"4548860","4551600"," I haven't had the time to look deeply into it yet."
"4552160","4554160"," But I'm willing to pay for that information."
"4554620","4558380"," So I'm going to go to I've got some friends that are hedge fund guys. "
"4558380","4564480"," I'm going to put a couple of feelers out and see if I can pay for a deeper information."
"4565320","4566020"," I need more."
"4566320","4570620"," I need more safety than I have making that call right now. "
"4574980","4575420"," WNBC."
"4578480","4580220"," Yeah, thanks for all of your time as well."
"4580460","4583160"," So what we'll do and I'm going to add some more stuff to these broadcasts. "
"4583160","4588380"," So you guys are going to get more discussion of the news events out there with slow times of the"
"4588380","4588620"," day."
"4589060","4593000"," I'm going to have more guests on or start to have guests on the program."
"4593320","4596060"," I'm going to try to start spending more time in the discord as well. "
"4596680","4598020"," I haven't had a lot of time."
"4598300","4604820"," I've been doing a lot of work in the background that has pulled me away from the settling down."
"4605040","4607240"," Although this is settling down somewhat, I can feel it. "
"4608020","4614040"," And but I still need another week or two to just get into a better have some of the stuff"
"4614040","4615520"," laid out for you guys out there."
"4618660","4622400"," Want to give a special thanks to young trader Aaron."
"4624240","4630370"," Yeah, I'm still wary on China too. "
"4631110","4636910"," I need to know that there's real money going into the emerging market market trade."
"4637070","4638450"," I know there's some money going into it."
"4638450","4640370"," Not necessarily China. "
"4640810","4642670"," Some of it's going into South America."
"4643730","4645990"," It's very dangerous still though right now."
"4646470","4649750"," I want to see a commitment from big US banks. "
"4653260","4655320"," All right, so you guys all have a wonderful evening."
"4656060","4659640"," I'm going to leave you with this tonight to trade what's in front of you."
"4660180","4665900"," I'm going to say to you that if don't we try and enter these trades after the fact. "
"4666860","4668840"," You know we take these trades long before."
"4670040","4674220"," You know we take profit before the risk moves into taking that trade."
"4675440","4678780"," And we know at some point in my view right now. "
"4679440","4682000"," As a bull, we're still in solid rip mode."
"4682260","4686600"," And so we're going to be looking for that next moment to take this market short once again."
"4692160","4692980"," I love all of you guys. "
"4693120","4693840"," Have a wonderful night."
"4695260","4698080"," And yet test wolfs the man horse lovers great."
"4699900","4701060"," Horse lovers awesome. "
"4703000","4703780"," Guiana baby."
"4704520","4705280"," That's right Jason."
"4705820","4707280"," You guys have a wonderful evening. "
"4708820","4710100"," Trade what's in front of you."
"4710200","4711220"," I don't know what else to say to you."
"4711960","4714700"," Any of you that were here on Friday as we closed out the day. "
"4715000","4715820"," I told you my trades."
"4719760","4723680"," Any of you guys buy 10 cent calls on Friday is the question."
"4724680","4727540"," Is anybody out there by 10 cent calls on Friday?"
"4731060","4732680"," Yeah, I think we can go short again. "
"4732880","4734960"," And we know my one thing about that Mary too."
"4736600","4740100"," Is that I want to see my one fear."
"4741320","4743120"," Is that if we go short on Monday. "
"4744420","4745620"," They might grind them."
"4746580","4751220"," So I'd be more inclined to do some more put spreads."
"4752840","4756260"," Or to hold off on puts into Wednesday. "
"4757420","4758780"," Maybe just day traded."
"4759620","4760540"," Into Wednesday."
"4761100","4763300"," That's my one other fear is that they're going to try to. "
"4763540","4766200"," They're going to try to eat them up even if we are going down fighting."
"4766620","4768060"," You guys all have a wonderful evening."
"4768840","4769380"," Good night cowboy. "
"4769380","4770220"," Good night all the way."
