"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","0","8440"," Good morning traders, Captain Jim James here, just got my coffee out so I'm still a little"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","8440","9960"," slow at this point."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","9960","15000"," But we are going to talk about a few things."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","15000","20280"," First of all, when I make videos for you, I'm not charging you 500 bucks for a course"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","20280","23400"," or a subscriptionary, that kind of stuff, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","23400","29320"," So I don't have an army of guys that can help me to put together all this due diligence"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","29320","30320"," every day."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","30320","39080"," I don't sell subscriptions, so I don't create fluff to make videos about to get to the point"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","39080","41880"," of you to understand why and where we're at."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","41880","49280"," Pretty much come to you with the due diligence already done, snap some lines to confirm and"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","49280","53440"," then put a video out for you, and I make it simple because, you know, I don't get paid"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","53440","54440"," for this."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","54440","58880"," If I got paid for this, I would do that stuff for you because that would pay for that to"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","58880","59880"," be done, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","59880","61600"," Anyways, I guess that's possible."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","61600","63760"," I can start charging if you want to be too."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","63760","71360"," I don't know why though, just take the videos and consume them, I guess, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","71360","74160"," Or compare them to what other people are telling you."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","74160","78920"," Now this is a neat morning though, and because I want to talk to you about something that"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","78920","83520"," happened earlier, and we're going to look here at the 24th."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","83520","87640"," I said it was the 29th on Twitter, but it was the 2024th."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","87640","92720"," This is an interesting date because before this, I could put this, before I could put"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","92720","100000"," this up a resistance in, right, I already knew about this, look here to the left, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","100000","104200"," I already knew about this top over here, but I also knew about this next one right below"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","104200","105200"," it."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","105200","110840"," And I knew that if we were to break above this top right here at the end of the day on"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","110840","114840"," the 22nd, that volatility would come into play."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","114840","121240"," When that volatility comes into play, the reaction is typically violent, and in a low"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","121240","123840"," liquidity environment, it can be very violent."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","123840","131000"," So back here, right towards the end of the 23rd, I was asking, or not the 23rd, right"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","131000","135120"," here at the end of the 24th, I was asking people on Twitter, I was hoping that we would"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","135120","142760"," get a dip into close and possibly even in after hours so that we wouldn't trigger that"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","142760","145600"," volatility in the overnight."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","145600","147800"," And nine times out of 10, we don't, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","147800","154000"," We will dip down, we'll come back up, and the game is played fairly, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","154000","161280"," Now, everything changed this night because I did buy Smuff D's down right at the bottom"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","161280","168240"," down here, and I went to bed, everything was great, and then I noticed that in the overnight,"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","168240","176560"," we went up crazy, it was like 0.5, 0.6, 0.7% until like 12 or 1 o'clock in the morning,"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","176560","181440"," and of course we triggered the volatility, and in a low liquidity environment, you saw"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","181440","184840"," what happened, it just dropped, okay?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","184840","190880"," And that's important to know, and it was important to know moving forward from that point of"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","190880","194840"," what was going on in the market, okay?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","194840","196280"," So this was important."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","196280","201360"," And now we're going to move forward to where we are right now, and what's important about"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","201360","203360"," what happened yesterday."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","203360","209320"," I talked to you, or to some of you on Twitter, until Joe exactly where to sell your longs."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","209320","216400"," I think I said it two, three times, I even went into my comment sections to beg people"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","216400","222600"," that I follow, people that follow me, please sell their longs, I think it was moments before"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","222600","223600"," we ricocheted."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","223680","228640"," And that's because although I have this yellow line here, we know where volatility is, we"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","228640","232880"," know where sellers are hiding, almost exactly where they're hiding."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","232880","239160"," Now, yesterday, as we sold off down here, I actually did put some spreads on, but I gave"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","239160","244200"," some time to them, and even earlier in the day, I posted some spreads with time on them"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","244200","252080"," to show that even if we dipped down lower, either yesterday or in future days, that it"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","252080","254160"," would give you the time for a recovery."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","254160","259080"," Now, the interesting part about that is the reason why I posted some spreads with a swing"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","259080","264160"," underneath was because if we got picked up in this area here, right, where liquidity"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","264160","267440"," should be, well, it starts to be here yet yesterday, it started to be right around this"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","267440","268440"," 457."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","268440","275760"," But anywhere from 460 to 455, zero, we should have had great liquidity here yesterday."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","275760","281160"," So my thought process was, well, we could probably still continue down the next day or"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","281200","286160"," into Friday, so we'll put some time on that so they swing back up after that event takes"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","286160","287160"," place."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","287160","293800"," Well, instead, what happened yesterday was someone, an entity that knows how to manipulate"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","293800","302080"," the market came in and maxed out zero-day puts in this moment here, and when this took"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","302080","307800"," place yesterday, market makers, dealer brokers, you can use them interchangeably, believe it"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","307800","309120"," or not."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","309120","313960"," Some people say there's a difference, but hedging needed to take place when that event"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","313960","314960"," took place."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","314960","322000"," And that drove us down to, so we have the spot gamma, right, and then we've got the real"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","322000","323000"," gamma, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","323000","329040"," I figure what it's called, but basically where the bottom liquidity is, we're like the hand"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","329040","330800"," of God comes out."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","330800","338560"," Now that hand of God, let me show you this, that hand of God is absolute down here at"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","338560","345920"," four forty, probably four forty-two seventy-nine spot, four forty four four zero and yes."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","345920","352120"," It's slightly different depending upon which index you're using, which derivative, etcetera."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","352120","358320"," Now, when we came down here, you can see where it stopped right before the bell, and there's"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","358320","362720"," a reason for that, because the reaction any lower would have been violent."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","362720","367400"," And you started to get that reaction, the fingertips of an invisible God reaching up"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","367400","369640"," that would grab it and catapult it."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","369640","375320"," If we had touched anywhere down here at four forty-seven or lower yesterday, we probably"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","375320","380720"," would have gone up, I'm not getting two hundred points, possibly in the overnight into the"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","380720","385280"," open today, that's how, that's how severe the reaction would be."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","385280","389840"," I would bet a hundred and fifty points in overnight and another fifty right off the bell."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","389840","392280"," So keep that in mind as we roll into today."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","392280","397040"," Now, there are some other factors you have to think about, you have to think about where"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","397040","398040"," we are in the week."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","398040","399040"," We've got Thursday and Friday."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","399040","400040"," We'll live here."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","400040","401040"," Bloodbath."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","401040","402840"," Will there be crazy moves today and tomorrow?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","402840","405960"," Typically, it starts to slow down as we get into a Friday, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","405960","406960"," Things just calm down."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","406960","410680"," The week is over, especially by eight thirty ten o'clock in the morning."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","410680","412480"," Well, I'm going to take a sip of my coffee."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","412480","417600"," So we can almost always ex-nay out more huge volatility on Friday."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","417600","418600"," There might be."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","418600","419600"," It can always happen."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","419600","420600"," There's always that five percent."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","420600","423120"," They have all these puts that expired in here, okay?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","423120","429640"," Which means that these broker-dealers, market makers will on hedge those puts."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","429640","434480"," And it's like, there's like a CME time that there's a time every day, I think it changes"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","434480","437200"," when all this shit is settled each day."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","437200","440160"," And there's more technical stuff about this, so I'm not going to get into it unless I"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","440160","443160"," pull, drag something up for it to read directly to you."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","443160","449440"," But anyways, as we roll into the open this morning, there are a few options."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","449440","454160"," But even within those options, most of them are finite, okay?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","454160","461160"," So if you're bearish on the open, you're going to be looking for heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy,"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","461160","467320"," like unseen, just like yesterday at right around two forty five, you're going to need"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","467320","471840"," to see ridiculous put flow right off the bell."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","471840","476520"," And if you did, you would see us drop back down here."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","476520","485480"," Now that move is not that big, you're talking 453, which it probably tags somewhere, 444.74"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","485480","488200"," on spy."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","488200","499720"," You might get 4404440 on the ES down here, but you're talking about the reaction, which"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","499720","508360"," would end up being the reaction would be a move to probably 470, I'd guess, because"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","508360","511400"," of the correlation between how severe it is."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","511400","517080"," It could even be higher from this point, it could move because you've got the right people"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","517080","523280"," buying that stuff, it could go higher, it could go 478 from this touch, this low."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","523280","524840"," So it's possible."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","524840","529720"," Now even if it does do this move down here, it's going to be so lightning fast, like a"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","529720","534240"," lightning bolt, that if you're short anywhere in this area, you're probably going to get"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","534240","535240"," trapped."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","535240","539000"," This would be the bear trap down here."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","539000","541840"," So I don't say to you at that point."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","541840","545720"," So if you're a bull, you would welcome this down here without a doubt, because anything"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","545720","552000"," down here, the reaction is going to print you probably five to ten thousand percent."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","552000","559920"," Now if there is a hedge fund or a bank that's doing this and they're not a foreign entity,"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","559920","565600"," we're going to talk about that later too, but if it's not a foreign entity, if it's"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","565600","570240"," like a GS or a JPM, more than likely what they're going to do is they're going to let"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","570240","574160"," it come back up to where the sellers are and they're going to take their profit from their"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","574160","579520"," longs that they've had for two years or whatever, and that's what's been going on in the past."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","579520","584640"," So, and that begins, there might be a little bit of trouble up around on spy at least"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","584640","595920"," 457-27, but in reality the real sellers are up here at 461 and higher, 461 and 464."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","595920","603000"," Now understand too, as we are heading into Thursday, Friday, you might see this operation"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","603000","605160"," end until Monday."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","605160","613240"," So if that happens, you will most definitely see 465 today or Friday, and you could possibly"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","613240","618760"," even see higher into Friday or Monday until the operation restarts again."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","618760","626280"," So either way, bulls are in control this morning to an extent, regardless if we drop at the"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","626280","632280"," open or if we move up at the open, either way we're going up heavy."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","632280","636120"," So anyways, that's a positive for bulls, okay?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","636120","640680"," Now if I had held shorts in the clothes yesterday, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","640680","645520"," That's what my trigger is going to be, I'm looking for, I wouldn't take this one here"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","645520","650360"," if we just started dropping at the open today, let's say I want to see what the market's"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","650360","654840"," going, I wouldn't take this short, I would be looking for a bounce here or down below"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","654840","664480"," to take a heavy long, real like heavy, 100% of account probably, that's how much conviction"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","664480","666000"," I have in this."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","666000","670520"," Now on the bell, let's say we start going up, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","670520","677880"," I would take a long here and I would be looking to sell today at 461, if I had to guess, it's"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","678880","687400"," not gas, but there's actual numbers here, 461 and if I don't see heavy put flow, like"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","687400","693080"," heavy, like you can't miss this order flow, if I don't see that order flow up here, I"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","693080","698600"," would hold until 465 today without even blinking an eyelash."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","698600","703520"," Now I would still close somewhere up here today, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","703520","708800"," And if I wanted to take my next short into, because today, right, we're, you got to remember"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","708800","714400"," today, we're on Thursday, right, if I was going to take my next short, I might take some"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","714400","720560"," spreads here, short, like I would like buy some put spreads that I could unfuck myself"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","720560","722640"," from if we keep going up next week."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","722640","726080"," But if you have high conviction that we're going to keep going down, that play might"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","726080","727800"," not take place."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","727800","732600"," I guess it could take place today, but that more than likely that play won't take place"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","732600","734360"," until Monday."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","734360","741520"," You're not going to see this operation go on Friday into the overnight into Sunday until"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","741520","744080"," the people that run it can do it full force."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","744080","746280"," They're going to take the money and run it at some point."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","746280","748120"," Let's look at it from another perspective too."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","748120","752280"," So let's say we do sell off here right at the open."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","752280","756480"," If we sell off down at the open, the operation is probably over."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","756480","762760"," If banks wanted to get ultra, uber crazy bullish or bearish or make max gains on this"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","762760","768880"," operation, they are going to let it come up so that they can take even more profit on"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","768880","771760"," a bigger swing down as we go down the road."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","771760","778280"," Now my last thing I want to talk to you about this morning is who's doing this?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","778280","782360"," In my view, the new, I like trading the news."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","782360","785520"," It's one of my, one of my like little side hobbies."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","785520","788520"," The news is very unreliable right now."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","788520","793440"," The news has nothing to do in my view to what's going on."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","793440","798720"," It's used like a tool sitting next to you to a five year old to explain what's going"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","798720","803440"," on even though it might not actually be to be like, oh, this is the bacon stretcher, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","803440","807640"," And you've got a wrench or something in front of you making jokes to a kid or someone that"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","807640","809200"," doesn't understand your trade."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","809200","810400"," This is the windshield."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","810400","813440"," This is the, this is the blinker fluid, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","813440","816920"," Telling a kid when you send them into the store to get a part for your car."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","816920","820240"," So the news is unreliable right now."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","820240","828200"," What is reliable is, in my view is that profit taking is happening from the run in 2020 into"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","828200","829200"," 2021."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","829200","835320"," Now, so pushing the news aside, you don't get caught up."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","835320","838680"," Right now, if you push the news aside, you don't get caught up in what's actually happening."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","838680","845560"," Yeah, there is a thought that it started to creep in my mind where we are because of"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","845560","850880"," how violent these moves are so early in our rollover period."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","850880","855440"," Like, let's say if the market was actually rolling over, we shouldn't be seeing these"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","855440","859120"," violent swings so early in the move."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","859120","863080"," We should be seeing, we should see this like slow rollover that takes place over the course"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","863080","869080"," of one to three months and then some violent moves each time we're coming to the end."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","869080","871140"," We're seeing these moves that right away."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","871140","876120"," So it makes me think that it's either one bank doing this or two banks doing this."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","876120","882120"," But if it starts to get deeper and deeper, if we start to trigger the vixen certain places,"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","882120","887600"," we start to trigger market crash signals to algorithms."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","887600","894640"," And it could, instead of an orderly exit from the market, it could be something that's"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","894640","898240"," dangerous to our country's national security."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","898240","902760"," And that would start to lead me to believe that it could be a foreign entity that is"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","902760","907160"," invested in our market and is running an operation against our country."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","907160","910320"," Now, that's not now, but we were close yesterday."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","910320","916760"," We were, I don't know how many of you realize how close we were at that belly yesterday"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","916760","921240"," triggering that and it looked like they, it looked like they knew exactly where that"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","921240","924400"," trigger was and pulled back right then, then in there."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","924400","927760"," Now, that still points towards American investors."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","927760","933480"," But if at any point that's triggered by American investors, like when I say investors, I mean"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","933480","941120"," like banks, if that is triggered by banks, it would be something that would, would need"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","941120","942120"," to be invested."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","942120","945000"," Now, I know, I know if I say this, like if it needs to be investigated by the Senate,"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","945000","948560"," you know, no one's going to investigate themselves and put themselves in prison."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","948560","955360"," But there is real danger every time we're doing this, there is real risk if it's someone"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","955360","963520"," outside of the United States to actually crash, not crash, collapse our market."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","963520","969440"," I, you know, I'm not a bear, I, I, you know, I don't say these, those things lightly."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","969440","977320"," So consider that as we move forward into today and to next week, and the way that the market"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","977320","984800"," is working right now, that the, how close, how close the risk was yesterday to triggering"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","984800","988200"," a like a crash, crash, but to a collapse cycle."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","988200","992240"," So if it's the wrong people doing it, in there, in they get a little too risky with it, a"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","992240","1002800"," little too, too, too much on the edge, the trigger is that it's not like 2018 or 2007,"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1002800","1003800"," it's much different."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1003800","1007480"," The mechanics of it, especially in today's market, are much different because so much,"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1007480","1011160"," so much competition goes into our markets."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1011160","1016640"," Now, and then I'll leave you with that, is that this move down here, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1016640","1019480"," This was an unnatural move into the closed yesterday."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1019480","1023680"," There's nothing, this was, this was manipulated into yesterday."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1023680","1025400"," So I would expect us to go up today."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1025400","1030840"," Now, some of you out there will wrap up this, this video with one last thing."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1030840","1035040"," Something up there are going to say, it doesn't matter, it's this news or it's this history"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1035040","1040320"," or it's this fifth wave, bullshit, but you can say whatever you want."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1040320","1045440"," Even if we do come down here today, the chances of it are low, like we're talking point five"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1045440","1048480"," to point 10%, something, something like that, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1048480","1054600"," So even if we do, the only thing I would say to you would be that I don't believe"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1054600","1060680"," that you're a trader because you're, if you take that risk once every 10 to 20 times,"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1060680","1063400"," you're going to blow up your accounts and never trade again."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1063400","1065440"," So I don't believe you're a trader."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1065440","1070680"," I don't believe that you are, whoever you say you are out there because I would say"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1070680","1074360"," that your next play that you take like that, you're going to blow your account and the"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1074360","1077080"," next one and the next one and the next one and the next one."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1077080","1079880"," Does that make sense, any sense to any of you?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1079880","1084920"," So in this, in this is my last one, one more last thing."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1084920","1088960"," This is like this move here, whether you were in it or not, excuse me, whether you were"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1088960","1093040"," in it or not on, I think this is Tuesday, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1093040","1097920"," Whether you were in this ending of the day, play or not, you still have to look at this"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1097920","1103240"," play from the start and this one up what, I think this is 110 points or something stupid,"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1103240","1104240"," something like that."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1104240","1107760"," So when you're like, well, why do you want me to sell up here, you have to look back"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1107760","1114040"," at what the run was and the same thing goes in here, you know, whether you got into the"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1114040","1121080"," short of the top here, which I fucking alerted you to yesterday, you still would have only"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1121080","1123040"," taken this short to here."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1123040","1126800"," If you really wanted to press it, you could have taken it down below, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1126800","1128640"," But even so, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1128640","1134000"," Even so, this was where there was no risk or this was where there was no risk."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1134000","1138400"," This is where your risk started to grow and this close right here, even if you're like,"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1138400","1142480"," hey, well, I'm just going to throw some FDs in here just in case we get down here."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1142480","1146600"," The chances of them paying out are, you know, 5 or 10%."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1146600","1151840"," So when you come on social media and you start telling people we're going to burn on Thursday"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1151840","1154920"," morning, I think that's, you shouldn't be saying that."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1154920","1158800"," You should be saying there's, you know, a 5% chance this burns, you should be honest"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1158800","1165720"," about it because you trick another bears into taking this short, not knowing what the"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1165720","1171120"," real risk is of that sell-off at open, you know, I don't know why I'm getting a conscience"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1171120","1174080"," this morning, but I fucking did."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1174080","1176720"," But I get a conscience up here too for bulls."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1176720","1181640"," I tell fucking bulls, close your shit out when it's appropriate."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1181640","1185480"," And so down here, that was the same thing, okay?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1185480","1191080"," So have fun trading today."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1191080","1194840"," You'd already heard what my plan is for today, right?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1194840","1198720"," If this comes down here, it's 100% balls in."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1198720","1204840"," My thought is that we might do some small bounce down here to grab some cash liquidity,"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1204840","1206000"," but I think it's already here."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1206000","1212920"," Matter of fact, I'm almost positive that cash liquidity will, no matter what, be at 450,"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1212920","1218880"," that we've got those expiring options that expired yesterday."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1218880","1226600"," And so you would need to see a new round of expiring options for Friday for this continuation"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1226600","1227600"," down."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1227600","1233680"," And even with that happening, you would see the hand of God come down and smack the fuck"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1233680","1235960"," out of you, okay?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1235960","1236960"," Good luck this morning."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1236960","1240000"," I'll see you out there trading."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1240000","1246120"," And I am looking to take this long and one last thing, everyone knows this."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1246120","1250080"," Anyone with money knows this is going to happen today."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1250080","1256320"," So they will be there to buy those outside of the money calls as well at the open or"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1256320","1257320"," somewhere down here."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1257320","1266880"," You'll see a grab, I guarantee it, 100,000%, not 100, like let's call it a 97% chance that"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1266880","1270720"," you're going to see massive money step in here today, okay?"
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1270720","1272680"," Good luck."
"ZQjD2wCOVGQ","1272680","1275680"," You've got a plan, if you're a bull, you've got a plan if you're a bear at this point."
