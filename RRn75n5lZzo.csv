"167860","168960"," Makes sure everything's going on. "
"169100","172120"," I got a bunch of stuff here to do in the background as you guys drop in right now."
"172400","173140"," Yeah, good morning everybody."
"178220","180440"," Yeah, so you could see last night. "
"181760","185080"," You could see last night that they bought overnight."
"185860","187120"," And then of course, hedge the market."
"187780","188920"," Let me bring this back here. "
"190240","191580"," Overnight, they bought it right."
"192220","194940"," And then you've got the dealers doing this kind of stuff last night."
"195240","197540"," And then of course they drop it again this morning in cash market. "
"198260","200320"," First chance they had above here in this liquidity."
"200700","201400"," We're heading down."
"201760","204780"," We should head down to summer around four thousand. "
"204780","206460"," I'm hoping for four thousand today."
"207180","209040"," It might take another day to get down there."
"210020","213840"," Somewhere down in here maybe for maybe three ninety six by Friday if possible. "
"217740","218440"," Excuse me."
"218600","221640"," Someone out last night to a football game football match."
"223220","226060"," Not hung over anything but a little sore. "
"226580","231000"," And my voice of course is torch because they had smoke going everywhere or whatever."
"232880","236020"," I'm going to send some triggers up for you just to get started here."
"237660","242580"," You know, I got to do I have to leave that up right there because I have to talk about"
"242580","243760"," that this morning. "
"247800","248760"," I'm tired."
"250940","255300"," But anyways, I turned off my turn off my my what."
"256800","258399"," My Twitter blue now. "
"260120","265180"," This is going to be some I don't know if it's a conspiracy theory, but."
"268120","273840"," This has been my experience, so I guess it's anecdotal, but I did not I was not a."
"274200","281080"," I was not a I was not a Twitter blue person, so I was I never used Twitter blue."
"281480","287420"," My Twitter experience as they started began to monetize it became worse. "
"291550","295590"," My Twitter experience became worse overall technically."
"296610","300590"," So the early trigger is four or eight fifty seven."
"301390","302270"," That's a right here. "
"303070","305010"," Early triggers right here for seven."
"305010","308890"," They sold right off on it right as we open this morning to see you guys can see this."
"309710","312650"," So just right away on the opening bell this morning. "
"312790","316930"," They teed right off on the early like it was nobody's business sold right down here."
"317290","320550"," And the our first real support the market."
"321710","325850"," So if you're just just heads up here this morning, so we got a bearish cross over here in the"
"325850","326190"," one minute. "
"327990","334530"," To be heading down in our first real support the market like not this but not like pivot supports."
"335230","337710"," And we'll go back and look at some other stuff down here."
"338110","339530"," There's a pop in. "
"341350","342650"," Previous low right here."
"343530","346730"," Previous low from yesterday that we're trading down to right now."
"346730","347710"," I'll show you this back here. "
"348950","350330"," Yesterday pivot right here."
"352710","356990"," Haven't made that new low just at this moment, but I expect us to make that new low."
"359720","361420"," Let me check the next one for you. "
"362400","364760"," We have one more down here."
"365100","367540"," Yes S2 is a previous low as well."
"369420","375160"," And the next previous low as S3 and you guys already you guys ready to wipe my party's target down"
"375160","375640"," below here. "
"376820","381360"," Nothing's changed on that just a matter of time to get down there so far less something changes."
"382440","387200"," There's no difference here in terms of just a matter of getting down there."
"387300","389980"," How long it takes to get down there with it being a short week. "
"390040","392040"," Maybe we get down there by by Thursday."
"393220","395300"," I hope that we can get down there right there."
"395380","396940"," We have a lot to talk about with that too. "
"398380","403320"," They saw an LA waiver this morning make a post on thin twit about."
"404960","406200"," Trend where we're headed."
"409980","411220"," We're in the third wave. "
"411640","412760"," Third corrective wave."
"413400","415480"," Then there's different people that have different thoughts on that."
"415920","417640"," So we'll talk about that today as well. "
"417960","419000"," We'll talk about we're going to talk about."
"419540","421060"," Pe ratios."
"421860","425380"," We're going to talk about where we should be headed. "
"425380","431500"," And hopefully that we had we need to get the VIX higher right to make a move higher unless we"
"431500","432760"," melt up the entire way."
"433380","434800"," And no one wants to trade that."
"435920","438900"," So right now we have this nice sell off here on this hourly trigger. "
"438900","444200"," This hourly triggers now acting as resistance not support at the moment to least."
"445240","447740"," And the expectation is that we go lower in the market."
"448460","450180"," I don't know how long this takes. "
"450500","452320"," It takes all week to go lower or not."
"453100","454580"," But hopefully we can get down there."
"454660","455560"," We can get down to that 400. "
"456140","459000"," Let's just look on a larger time or a longer time frame here."
"459200","460300"," Let's go to SPX real quick."
"468670","471930"," So in reality here we don't want to be riding up. "
"472590","475690"," The bones are bands all the way upright just grinding and grinding."
"476450","478690"," We'd really like to get a viable bottom down here."
"478890","481190"," We see 390 82 on SPX. "
"481970","484290"," We know that traditional chatting doesn't mean anything."
"484750","487050"," But to an extent until it fails it does."
"488530","490530"," Or it can I guess. "
"490970","495130"," So just inside here we're still in an uptrend which is what we want to see."
"496290","498550"," We're going to expect this uptrend to continue."
"500150","502570"," We've got no issues here with an uptrend continuing. "
"503010","509090"," And I've got no issues here with us picking this up and squeezing up higher and start needing to"
"509090","510050"," break through above here."
"510050","515030"," I showed you in yesterday's stream how a trend is carried."
"515230","519390"," We need more support to break us through this resistance above here. "
"519470","520830"," Let me see if I can show you this."
"524840","526980"," Let me just quick second here."
"529280","530200"," Show you this way. "
"530620","532300"," The SPX on a daily chart."
"533080","537920"," I've showed you yesterday how we shouldn't trade down here to like 385 or any kind of nonsense like"
"537920","538140"," that."
"538440","540000"," We should get picked right back up. "
"540080","541000"," We've got daily trend."
"541000","542740"," And this is kind of like the key here."
"542960","544300"," This is the key yesterday too. "
"545000","547500"," Is that trend is below us."
"547920","553160"," So I'm assuming that there's people out there that are like yeah we're going to trade down to this."
"553280","554560"," Here's 4000 right here. "
"554660","556780"," I kind of like this as the deepest we go."
"557140","558020"," Just right down here."
"558640","561820"," It's picked right back up and we start breaking breaking above. "
"562240","568140"," Even if we have to fight for it to break this descending resistance here."
"569060","571880"," So we can actually get up here and start tagging some of these highs."
"572420","574960"," And as long as we and this is the key point I'm trying to make here. "
"575580","577320"," This is the key point if you're following me."
"577880","579520"," You're listening in right now out there."
"580520","582160"," If you're an Elliott waiver out there. "
"583260","585040"," As long as this trend is maintained."
"586240","587420"," This is all valid up here."
"588340","590800"," Nothing has changed to invalidate this at this point. "
"591740","592640"," Nothing at all."
"592820","598000"," And there's major trend underneath major velocity underneath for this to continue to play out."
"598880","600900"," I've got no issues with this playing out. "
"601000","601840"," No matter what anybody's telling you."
"601880","603360"," I'm going to give a fuck about the JPM caller."
"604400","604800"," Honestly. "
"605340","606020"," The fucking Jay."
"606140","608140"," I hear some shit about JPM caller yesterday."
"608140","608460"," I'm like. "
"609860","611740"," If we trade up anywhere up in here."
"612060","613220"," The JPM caller."
"613480","615460"," We're not bound to shit at that point. "
"615600","616860"," As long as that hedge is paid for."
"617160","617940"," We can continue higher."
"618680","619200"," There's nothing. "
"620440","621880"," They can stop us from going higher."
"622100","623380"," So anyway I'll talk about that."
"623500","624660"," Maybe I'll talk about that later today. "
"626280","628700"," Like last six quarters last eight quarters."
"628780","632120"," I'm like yeah but talk to them about the fucking previous quarter quarters where."
"632700","635960"," Once the hedge was bought we had no reason to go down. "
"636500","637380"," From that point."
"637620","637760"," So."
"638560","640640"," Just the heads up for your Elliott waiver out there. "
"640820","642660"," All this is still structurally intact."
"642760","643880"," This way three."
"644440","645060"," Take it up here. "
"645480","647260"," If it does extend to four sixty four."
"647340","648440"," I have no fucking idea."
"648820","650560"," But there's ways for us to see that. "
"650760","651300"," And there's ways."
"651680","652780"," The key point here is that."
"653440","654500"," If this breaks. "
"654960","657080"," There's ways for us to see if it breaks."
"657260","658620"," There's ways for us to know."
"659520","662440"," If the market breaks down and you should become fearful. "
"663560","666780"," That we're going to have our last plunge to the depths of hell and."
"667660","670760"," I don't know bonds are going to finally fucking print for gun lock."
"673420","675580"," Any of that like doom doom and gloom. "
"676020","677160"," We'll know before it happens."
"677160","677920"," So."
"678340","682080"," And I'm going to show you the easy way to see if it's going to happen. "
"683840","685700"," So here I'll bring this up for you real quick."
"686060","686880"," And just on a."
"688520","690280"," Just go to a thirty minute chart here."
"690540","693060"," So if your Elliott waiver out there and you're like hey is this is this. "
"693340","694400"," Is there any point where this."
"695240","696820"," With this wave three is over."
"703030","704250"," Sorry my voice is more. "
"704330","704970"," It's all fucked up."
"705150","708430"," They've had a screaming and yelling and singing and all kinds of stupid shit last night."
"708850","710070"," I'm like why am I doing this. "
"711450","712910"," Should have been on the other side of the field."
"713370","714170"," And the game was great."
"714410","714530"," So. "
"715770","717030"," I got some pictures for you guys too."
"717650","718110"," But my."
"718810","720430"," You guys tip yesterday about my daughter. "
"721190","722270"," Put the at with a."
"724390","726330"," Like ball thing on top of it."
"726470","728030"," I got some pictures of my phone."
"728110","728630"," I've heard doing that. "
"728770","729650"," So maybe I'll just show them to you."
"729890","732010"," And if Mohammed's out there this morning."
"732390","733370"," Who is your friend. "
"734410","735790"," Mohammed that is on the team."
"736070","736690"," If you're out there Mohammed."
"737690","740530"," Let me know the name of the guy because I think I took a picture of him last night. "
"740890","743050"," I was going to talk to him last night and the shit."
"743570","746990"," Everything got crazy last night because they were winning and blah blah blah."
"747330","750350"," There were big fights happening on the field and stuff like that between the players. "
"751150","752410"," Someone's sportsman like shit."
"754710","756510"," But what I want to show you guys here is this."
"756790","758950"," So if you're if you're an Elliott waiver. "
"760670","762230"," Just for this stuff right here."
"762250","763250"," So like here's 400."
"764190","766270"," Here is 3972. "
"766850","769450"," Here's 396 38 right here."
"769710","771050"," And these at these trend."
"771050","771970"," These aren't trends. "
"772170","772630"," These are velocity."
"773290","775810"," And when they're moving up like this right."
"777250","778470"," Changes to yellow here. "
"779470","782370"," And just pretend I'm drawing the orange one of the blue one."
"782870","787530"," Now you start seeing these trends come up here in price stays above."
"789930","791270"," This daily trend. "
"792470","793990"," That way three is still good."
"794210","797410"," You want to see extensions and as long as we train above this daily trend we train above this"
"797410","797870"," hourly trend."
"798990","800550"," There's no fear at that point. "
"802110","806270"," Now you're monthly is not going to track the same time frame of course."
"807590","808030"," So."
"809450","811130"," You know this stuff can stay down here. "
"812750","814450"," And this blue one can stay lower."
"815430","816430"," It's not going to track."
"816630","818550"," It's going to take months for this to come up. "
"819410","821790"," But if price stays above this stuff."
"822110","822670"," No matter."
"822850","824570"," I mean a bear can fucking cry me a river. "
"825070","825650"," I'm honest."
"825850","826450"," I'm being honest here."
"826750","828130"," Bear can cry me a fucking river. "
"828710","830010"," The crash collapse bear."
"830230","831530"," Cry me a fucking river."
"831910","833930"," As long as we as price stays above. "
"834410","834510"," Right."
"834990","837510"," No matter what kind of shit they spell to you."
"837610","839010"," I mean it's not like you can't be short here. "
"839490","839890"," Right."
"840190","842450"," Or you shouldn't be short here trying to make some money here."
"842510","845030"," But anyone trying to tell you like we're getting a crash. "
"845950","846930"," Bonds are going to print."
"847150","848270"," And that kind of fucking nonsense."
"848490","849770"," As long as price stays up here. "
"850030","851170"," They don't have a fucking story."
"851630","853130"," And they really can't tell you that story."
"854110","857770"," They can't tell you that story unless price starts to break down. "
"858470","860210"," And even if it does start to break down."
"860610","863990"," You're talking about having a warning at like three ninety five."
"864350","867190"," I mean we're all talking about fucking crashes out there and I'm like. "
"868130","872590"," I mean I got to wake up tomorrow fucking morning and see us down to like three ninety."
"874650","876710"," And not that we can't just."
"877410","878850"," You know three fucking ninety. "
"879570","881770"," Three fucking eighty three seventy."
"883110","886130"," Three fucking forty five was the fucking bottom."
"886850","888470"," In twenty twenty two. "
"888690","889030"," So."
"889650","891970"," I mean what am I supposed to be a fucking afraid of here."
"892730","894510"," I don't know what that is. "
"895050","897470"," It's kind of like that Zamboni from."
"898010","899810"," It's kind of like that Zamboni from."
"901650","904130"," Austin powers like what can you do. "
"904310","907010"," Let's say we say we got tomorrow we're down three hundred points."
"907550","909150"," Fuck my what do I care."
"910990","913110"," Can I jump on it if it happens. "
"913450","913610"," Yeah."
"914270","914390"," So."
"915510","917530"," There's no real like there's no risk. "
"917530","918950"," Like people think there is."
"920010","920470"," So."
"921150","923710"," You know if you're along an apple on the last bottom on Apple. "
"924070","927110"," Like what do you think you're going to wake up tomorrow and Apple's going to be down fucking seven"
"927110","928170"," thousand points or something."
"928170","930110"," I'm exaggerating here of course but."
"931490","935130"," You know it's not like you can't get your money out of the market with the market. "
"935710","936690"," It's so bizarre."
"937090","938910"," It's like it's all fucking bizarre."
"939950","942670"," So if that happens and you want to pull the parachute you do it. "
"943190","945110"," You want to hedge the market you hedge it right."
"945290","946710"," Good time to hedge the market right here right."
"948930","953230"," You know you want to take like a three or six month out hedge in the market to protect yourself. "
"953490","953630"," Sure."
"953630","957550"," But all it's like all this talk that I see is just fucking pure nonsense."
"958730","962830"," Although there is a part of the market right now because there is no liquidity or where this mad"
"962830","963470"," Russia's right. "
"963790","964910"," We're all rushing into tech."
"965090","965950"," We're all rushing into gold."
"966110","967010"," We're all rushing into this. "

"970670","973170"," We heard gunlock made a post on Twitter about this."
"973650","974870"," We go here was pissed off. "
"975030","977050"," You see Jamie Diamond and all his bullshit right."
"978110","979090"," They all buy bond."
"979290","980210"," They're all buying bonds right. "
"980350","983490"," They want to fucking get paid and they don't want to wait a year for it or two years."
"984470","985790"," They want it now."
"986210","987610"," You know they're always going to bitch in one. "
"987790","989130"," They're just like fucking children."
"989710","990370"," They are."
"990610","991270"," They're like children. "
"991570","994730"," It's like that's why they are where they are right."
"995550","997190"," That's what five billionaires are where they are."
"997750","999050"," Whiny fucking bitches. "
"1000970","1001970"," That's all they are man."
"1002530","1004830"," I know these people I hang out on them ski with them hike with them."
"1005010","1006550"," They're just normal fucking people. "
"1007110","1009090"," I'm not like a millionaire like bro bro."
"1009410","1012770"," I'm talking about billionaires these guys you know they're just whiny fucking bitches."
"1012770","1016570"," So anyways my point here is this is you're going to see it. "
"1017250","1018270"," You're going to see it."
"1018530","1023170"," I mean if you're along at three forty five fuck you care for four hundred."
"1023630","1024890"," You think you're going to wake up tomorrow. "
"1024910","1026410"," We're going to be at three forty five tomorrow."
"1026849","1027670"," You'd be flat."
"1028810","1030970"," You'd be fucking flat since last October. "
"1032130","1034150"," That's my point about it's so bizarre."
"1034310","1039710"," It's like it's like people on social media are like yeah fucking bulls bought apple at one sixty"
"1039710","1040210"," five."
"1040210","1042990"," And I'm like they didn't fucking buy it at one sixty five. "
"1043849","1044730"," Get fucked."
"1046010","1049530"," That's why we're at one sixty five was because they bought the fucking bottom."
"1052970","1053930"," So bizarre. "
"1054410","1055910"," It's like it's so bizarre."
"1056170","1056910"," It's like the bizarre."
"1057170","1058910"," I'm assuming that people don't don't shit. "
"1059050","1064350"," They're making this shit up or selling fees or selling a service or they don't have any real"
"1064350","1065510"," fucking money or something."
"1065610","1066670"," They have to be."
"1069210","1071170"," And there's other places to keep your money too. "
"1071630","1073290"," So I don't know."
"1073630","1074850"," I mean there's a ton of people on the side."
"1075070","1078350"," I've got friends that are like on the sidelines and money market accounts and they're like I'm"
"1078350","1078750"," doing great. "
"1079430","1080890"," And I don't know why people are screaming."
"1081710","1083770"," But there I was having a conversation with a friend this morning."
"1084370","1085270"," We're talking about that. "
"1085370","1087350"," We're talking about the idea that."
"1089570","1090570"," Markets you know."
"1091730","1094470"," Is this is this our future is our future going to be. "
"1095350","1097810"," Where we have a market crash threat every two years."
"1098430","1101850"," Or we're going to be living under a market crash threat all the time."
"1102470","1103510"," Is this just noise. "
"1103510","1104850"," I mean literal noise."
"1105070","1107050"," Do you think a billionaire is going to tell you the fucking truth."
"1108110","1109830"," I think a billionaire is going to tell you the fucking truth. "
"1110030","1111390"," I think a billionaire is going to go out there and tell you."
"1111630","1113010"," Buy here and sell there."
"1113650","1114350"," A retail trader. "
"1114610","1115890"," Fuck no they're not going to tell you that."
"1116390","1117750"," No one gives a fuck about you."
"1119350","1120630"," So they're not going to tell you that. "
"1121270","1123590"," You know is this what our market has come to."
"1123750","1127170"," Is this what our is our market going to be something where someone's always telling me there's"
"1127170","1128130"," going to be a market crash tomorrow."
"1128490","1129910"," Like every fucking day. "
"1131290","1132670"," Our market isn't that."
"1133030","1134490"," That's not our stock market."
"1135290","1136610"," Generally speaking it's not. "
"1137270","1139910"," For multi year like hey we're gonna have a decade of crashes."
"1142230","1146670"," We might trade sideways and up and then have a have a have a have a week."
"1146670","1149070"," Three months or six months or something. "
"1149070","1154010"," We keep going up into the right is my point and prices and prices important here."
"1155110","1159470"," Cause when you start looking back you're like shit I should have bought that shit."
"1160030","1163130"," Cause the next crash is usually higher than the last one. "
"1163990","1166550"," Usually as a matter of fact said this before."
"1166970","1169430"," If Mike Barry didn't get that second fucking leg down."
"1170050","1170690"," He would have been in prison. "
"1172550","1175690"," And not only that but he just wrote all that shit up."
"1175850","1177710"," He'd be fucking a trillionaire."
"1178150","1181450"," So he kind of fucked his clients in the same. "
"1181830","1182950"," He fucked his clients twice."
"1183870","1185570"," Well he fucked his clients once."
"1186430","1188210"," And had we not had that last leg down. "
"1188870","1189950"," He would have been up Schitt's Creek."
"1191330","1193050"," So you know it's kind of a weird thing."
"1193270","1194930"," Anyways my point behind this is this though. "
"1195470","1196350"," I have a point here."
"1196590","1197270"," I'm trying to get to."
"1199810","1202490"," And that's a PE ratio. "
"1202870","1203730"," So I want to show you this."
"1204630","1205690"," I want to show you a couple things."
"1205910","1211570"," First thing I want to show you is you heard gun lock complaining about the bond market. "
"1212430","1216970"," And then you also see the Jamie Diamond stuff."
"1218190","1219910"," And what do I got here for you?"
"1220430","1221230"," Hold on a second here."
"1221910","1222570"," Where is that?"
"1225210","1232710"," I made a post on an advanced Twitter search. "
"1234810","1237150"," And he's not the only one lining up is my point."
"1240810","1242730"," He's not the only one lining up with this shit."
"1243110","1247250"," So we've got I want to show you this post that I made. "
"1247250","1257070"," And this was"
"1257070","1266550"," this was this was this was back on"
"1266550","1269650"," February 4th."
"1270470","1277010"," And I said Jim channels and a bunch of boomers had no problem buying the Ford PE ratio dip going"
"1277010","1279090"," all the way back before we were."
"1279630","1284330"," I shouldn't have wrote we or they were even trading misspelled that. "
"1284330","1286570"," But now all of a sudden they forgot to buy this one."
"1286750","1288210"," Laugh my fucking ass off."
"1288950","1290550"," And we're going to look at it right now. "
"1291270","1297330"," And this this these are you know like they they have like channels was like I haven't seen this"
"1297330","1299490"," much greed since the beginning of time."
"1300530","1307290"," And I'm like fucking Jim channels been buying this PE ratio going all the way the fuck back in time"
"1307290","1314630"," and lo and behold they did it again right here where my cursor is they fucking did it again in"
"1314630","1323330"," fucking January of 2023 or December I think this is actually October right here."
"1323770","1328890"," I think this is actually October they did it again in October they fucking did it again in October"
"1328890","1335990"," and then he was bitching about it in February and I'm like I'm like this guy was fucking either him"
"1335990","1340470"," or someone else was long in October and he missed the ride. "
"1340470","1344090"," And you see these things get bought."
"1344530","1348650"," I'm going to bring you up the current this I'm going to bring you up that chart right now currently"
"1348650","1349870"," for you."
"1352540","1354240"," So I'm going to show it to you right now. "
"1355680","1357940"," And I want to I want you to see it right here."
"1359500","1362440"," And this is a monthly chart this is the same chart right now."
"1363520","1364900"," I'm bringing up here for you. "
"1365680","1367360"," I don't know if you can see this or not but."
"1368400","1372740"," Let's make this white or something yellow I guess make a four."
"1373920","1375740"," Just so you can see it right here. "
"1377580","1381700"," And now this is September one Thursday September."
"1384000","1387520"," What do they do just like they do all the fucking time they buy it."
"1388280","1393220"," And they did it again and guess what's happened since then guess what's happened. "
"1394000","1394660"," It's gone up."
"1395980","1398740"," It hasn't gone down hasn't crashed through."
"1401100","1402460"," I want to say. "
"1407810","1411330"," Right it's gone up is my point here so this is gone up."
"1411950","1417630"," So so when you hear these people say things and let's say it comes back down and bounces again."
"1418390","1419790"," It has to go lower. "
"1421310","1424950"," If it doesn't go lower they're fine there's they still have exposure in this market."
"1426330","1429990"," You can see this big race up here this big slam down right."
"1430970","1434890"," And lo and behold we've had time for the market to go sideways. "
"1438080","1441420"," We've had time for the market to go sideways look at the spy on the one minute."
"1448400","1449460"," Take a little minute here."
"1454260","1455680"," We sold off. "
"1456380","1461920"," If there's been time in the market."
"1463560","1464760"," To go sideways."
"1465580","1466800"," Does that point to you. "
"1468120","1471640"," And so when you when you have time in the market that one of the one of the one of"
"1471640","1474100"," the savvy things I can afford the fed."
"1474740","1479040"," Is that they have a silent bear market for the end of 2020."
"1479040","1482480"," Twenty twenty one they did and then twenty twenty fucking two they did. "
"1483140","1489940"," And so they bought time for the market to trade sideways and down into where this velocity is."
"1492360","1497820"," So even if we get a crash or a dip which I expect right you expect it to some extent."
"1500220","1502360"," And you know that these people want it. "
"1502540","1503560"," These people are long bonds."
"1503560","1506340"," I have money and bonds I want to get paid."
"1507120","1509900"," I don't want to hear Jerome Powell up there trying to extend this. "
"1510420","1511880"," I want to crash this summer."
"1513060","1514580"," Or this fall or whatever it is."
"1518990","1523790"," So my point here is they don't want to extend it to three years they want to get paid this"
"1523790","1524990"," fucking year at some point. "
"1526050","1530550"," And I was having a conversation with a friend if you guys want to look that up by the way"
"1530550","1532990"," you can do this on your own."
"1534530","1536350"," Here I'll show it to you on the screener."
"1537210","1537990"," I'm going to find this. "
"1542440","1543300"," Let me see here."
"1544580","1548080"," It's a Q U A N D L."
"1551120","1559300"," Anyways, MLUTPL backslash are divided by multiples divided by S B 500 underscore PE ratio month."
"1560360","1562600"," You can just I think you can just search on Google. "
"1564660","1569940"," For PE ratios S B 500 trading view and you'll really get it for yourself now."
"1571640","1573220"," My point here though is."
"1573980","1576980"," No fucking billionaires going to tell you they fucking bought. "
"1577780","1581100"," Going all the way back to the nineteen late late nineteen seventies."
"1581440","1584940"," And buying the the the PE ratio lows all the way up."
"1585500","1586420"," They're not going to tell you that. "
"1588120","1591400"," You have competing interests people have money inside of the bond market."
"1592540","1593460"," High quality bonds."
"1593520","1594500"," They want to get paid too. "
"1595340","1597780"," So they're going to scream and yell at you in public."
"1598460","1601320"," You know, let's have that capitulation moment right now."
"1601420","1602160"," I need it right now. "
"1602220","1603020"," I can't have it in three years."
"1603020","1603920"," They're going to have it this year."
"1604420","1607280"," I want to see TLT rip faces off this year. "
"1609700","1611260"," And you're seeing it right now."
"1611320","1614660"," I'm going to show you Erica Balcunas on Twitter this morning."
"1615380","1615740"," Made a post. "
"1616240","1617040"," You can spell his name."
"1617140","1618020"," It's E R I C."
"1618020","1621860"," And his last name is B A L C H U N A S."
"1622060","1623080"," And he wrote this morning."
"1623740","1624780"," Well, money market funds. "
"1624880","1626260"," Let me see him bring him up real quick."
"1628420","1629880"," Just bring him up real quick."
"1635650","1637510"," My man Eric knows what he's talking about. "
"1637590","1638010"," Smart guy."
"1639450","1642590"," Don't at me about having a white background on Twitter either."
"1648750","1652430"," I'm going to I'm going to black for a black background black version somewhere else. "
"1654930","1656550"," But here he is right here this morning."
"1656650","1661730"," He made a post and he wrote while money market funds suck up tons of cash and oxygen."
"1662530","1668110"," ETF investors are quality loading up up on duration risk as tens of billions are flowing into"
"1668110","1669430"," intermediate long term bonds. "
"1670190","1671430"," Bedding pal will blink."
"1673450","1675370"," And you know that everybody's buying."
"1675710","1677630"," You can see how bullish TLT is. "
"1677810","1679850"," You can see that TLT wants to rip faces off."
"1680690","1682650"," So these people want to get paid and they don't want to get told."
"1682970","1683090"," No. "
"1683730","1688330"," You saw any peak coming out this morning, which lends itself to less."
"1689210","1692850"," Which lends itself to less rate hikes, right?"
"1693610","1696050"," Maybe a rate of pause or cutting rates."
"1696830","1699610"," And some of you out there know this and some of you don't. "
"1700250","1705630"," Then if they start cutting rates, we're likely going to have the if we're in that trough, right?"
"1705770","1707770"," We're in the sideways and up trading trough."
"1708330","1712950"," That we typically get sideways trough like we can't we trade it down, right?"
"1713610","1717550"," We're going to trade sideways and we're going to get that blast down and then come back up, right?"
"1718350","1720650"," Then the confirmation trade is farther in time, right?"
"1720890","1724010"," We usually blast up here confirm that we're at the markets going to go higher."
"1724010","1729250"," You guys understand this whole kind of assuming and a very basically chicken scratches you get the"
"1729250","1729970"," idea behind this. "
"1730250","1734030"," We're in this trough right now and they want that last crash."
"1734430","1739850"," And so even if they do crash it there, there's two things that you know."
"1740630","1746050"," You know if we start trading below 390 and it confirms that we're heading lower from there. "
"1746530","1748230"," That's probably coming our way."
"1748990","1754870"," You know that if we trade down there that it's likely going to be for a short period of time."
"1754890","1758850"," It's not going to be for three fucking years. "
"1759370","1764650"," It's like a month and a half normally month and a half three months, something like that."
"1765190","1766230"," It's not that long."
"1766470","1768170"," So you have to protect yourself. "
"1768410","1769570"," You don't want to get caught in reprising."
"1770350","1775610"," But if you're let's say you're along the market in spy or cues or something that doesn't get"
"1775610","1776150"," repriced."
"1777170","1778710"," You like, hey, it's never come back. "
"1779150","1784130"," I'm along the spec growth ticker that rode up the $300 and right now it's sitting at $100."
"1784510","1788970"," And they when they drop this market the last time, they actually drop that ticker that you love."
"1789510","1794550"," And now it's in a trading range of one to 20 bucks for the next 30 years with stock markets"
"1794550","1795630"," littered with those companies. "
"1798470","1803090"," So have that exposure right now probably shouldn't have it, but have the exposure like spy or"
"1803090","1803390"," something."
"1803390","1805110"," No problem having that exposure."
"1806430","1812390"," There's plenty of downside move for you to know to get out of the way to before you wake up"
"1812390","1814510"," one morning in the spies down 900 points. "
"1815070","1816050"," That's it's not happening."
"1816290","1817450"," It's not happening over one night."
"1818150","1821050"," And you know where the you know where the line can't be crossed. "
"1821150","1827550"," You know where you have to cut your exposure and hold on to your hedges for that big move down"
"1827550","1830710"," and a little bit of exposure inside of bonds doesn't hurt either."
"1830710","1831010"," Right."
"1831250","1836830"," Since January, we've said if TLT is at a low, you buy it in its channel. "
"1837310","1843900"," If you look at TLT that has worked itself out quite nicely."
"1845420","1846080"," This year."
"1847980","1851980"," Right at the beginning of the year, we said dips by a dip by a dip by a dip. "
"1852260","1852420"," Right."
"1853120","1855900"," And you can see right here that they want this squeeze right."
"1856220","1860420"," You can see that these these these these bond bulls want to see that massive run of higher. "
"1860420","1864720"," They want to see the market roll over that one last time and get paid."
"1865720","1869840"," And Jerome's basically saying fuck you know that it's going to happen down here."
"1870520","1872200"," And so you've got rage on that right. "
"1872440","1874620"," You've got rage in the market here."
"1875020","1879740"," You've got people that own this own bonds and they want this payout."
"1880120","1882620"," They want that payout regardless of what you want. "
"1892270","1898290"," And I'll show you TLT right now and also why people want that payout too."
"1898410","1901670"," I'll show you why TLT is quite bullish right now."
"1912770","1914670"," So that's why you're here in the drums beat right. "
"1914810","1916830"," You're like, why is the drum beating on TLT?"
"1917190","1918590"," Why is the drum beating on bonds?"
"1919470","1924580"," It's right here."
"1926140","1927560"," Whatever it's up here."
"1928720","1931580"," I need to see this right here back here right March 23rd. "
"1932160","1934040"," Cranked up, cranked up, cranked up."
"1934440","1936840"," Now we've got you can actually see it back here too."
"1938140","1938660"," Right. "
"1938800","1939880"," Watch the screen line right here."
"1940100","1940520"," Cranked up."
"1941280","1942660"," Big giant squeeze right. "
"1943140","1944560"," Huge squeeze right here."
"1945660","1945920"," Right."
"1948890","1956320"," This is back on the March 9th of 2023. "
"1956320","1957660"," Big old squeeze."
"1958080","1959800"," And the same setup is here."
"1960040","1965040"," Same setup as right now where these bond bulls are like, get me up there. "
"1965160","1965760"," Start squeezing."
"1966240","1966960"," Get the daily up."
"1967080","1967780"," Get the hourly up. "
"1967840","1968680"," Start squeezing up."
"1968680","1969760"," Get some new highs."
"1970340","1971580"," Let me get paid out of bonds. "
"1972520","1974580"," So you're going to hear that drum beat out there."
"1975320","1975420"," Right."
"1975740","1978660"," You're definitely going to hear that drum beat out there. "
"1979240","1980580"," It's just like back here."
"1981000","1982220"," Just like back here."
"1982220","1984520"," This is early March 2023. "
"1984920","1987520"," They want that giant squeeze up in TLT."
"1987900","1989320"," They don't care how they get it."
"1989500","1990500"," We put this back over here. "
"1991580","1995710"," I'm tired here."
"2012310","2014410"," And they're going to tell you whatever they need to get paid this."
"2014550","2017910"," They're going to tell you the markets crashed and the world's going to end all this other stuff. "
"2020150","2022430"," So you have to understand that there's competing interest."
"2022770","2023190"," Oh, yeah."
"2023370","2024530"," Nice selling on the spy baby. "
"2024710","2024850"," Whoo."
"2026390","2027810"," They're going to tell you this stuff."
"2027970","2029910"," They're going to tell you that the market's going to crash. "
"2029910","2031130"," They're going to sell that to you."
"2031190","2033410"," They need to because they need to get paid."
"2034170","2034950"," Does that make sense?"
"2035470","2036730"," Nice selling right now on the spy. "
"2037030","2038430"," Beautiful selling on the spy right now."
"2039790","2041590"," So meanwhile, while they're telling you this."
"2043550","2047969"," The only thing that you need to know is hopefully we get down to 400. "
"2048909","2049310"," 396."
"2050409","2051250"," Something like that."
"2051989","2053150"," And that that dip gets bought. "
"2053949","2056850"," So you just put that stuff to the side about bonds right now."
"2056850","2058929"," It's a nice selection to coming on right now."
"2059929","2060650"," Gorgeous selling. "
"2061090","2070100"," I was talking to Winky this morning and I was like they're going to pump this and sell this shit"
"2070100","2071260"," to the depths of hell today."
"2072900","2074739"," And they are which is awesome."
"2078679","2080900"," Need to get down to 400 if we can. "
"2081040","2082520"," 496 somewhere in there."
"2085600","2087100"," So just be aware of that."
"2087360","2090600"," My point here is be aware that you have competing interests. "
"2090960","2091659"," They're telling you."
"2092400","2093940"," Well, there's three things right."
"2094040","2094840"," There's competing interests. "
"2095080","2096920"," There's number one."
"2096940","2098220"," The markets should roll over."
"2098440","2104700"," We knew we actually take strike where the rollover was on Sunday right middle of the night and then"
"2104700","2105860"," early Sunday morning. "
"2106700","2111760"," And then we know the market needs to cool off a little bit."
"2111760","2116300"," So you see that you're going to see because of that everyone knowing we're going to sell."
"2117100","2120940"," You're going to see drum beats and they're going to tell you, Hey man, print my bonds for me. "
"2120940","2121600"," You know what I'm saying?"
"2122000","2124160"," And these people have bonds when they tell you that."
"2124280","2125360"," They're going to push that narrative."
"2125760","2128240"," Probably not trading four or six sixty five. "
"2128540","2129260"," Hold on a second here."
"2154080","2154560"," Okay."
"2155640","2156560"," I'm fine again. "
"2158500","2159960"," So when you have this."
"2161100","2165420"," When you have these narratives being pushed out there, you just need to be able to measure what"
"2165420","2166760"," people really mean."
"2167380","2169120"," Are we definitely going down there?"
"2169420","2171280"," If we are going down there, how long is it?"
"2172380","2175340"," Is that something where you cut your like, do you panic sell?"
"2175680","2179160"," Let's say you are along the Mario say along spy and spy crashes for a month and a half. "
"2179440","2185700"," If you miss it, now you should be aware like, Hey, 396 390 somewhere in there."
"2185700","2186860"," You start to get concerned."
"2187760","2192800"," If that doesn't hold, you start to get concerned that we are going to get that last, that last or"
"2192800","2195220"," send that last blood bath. "
"2195660","2198200"," We do know we've been talking about this."
"2198200","2200300"," We're in what April now?"
"2200620","2204400"," How long have we been talking on this stream about expecting?"
"2204400","2211500"," We've done whole shows on an expectation of a capitulation trade lower at some point this year."
"2212460","2215720"," It's the fucking four month, fourth month of 2023. "
"2216660","2221320"," We only have like three two or two thirds of the rest of the year left for that to play"
"2221320","2221580"," out."
"2222360","2223880"," So will it play out this year?"
"2224820","2225680"," Do you hedge for it?"
"2225680","2226000"," Yeah."
"2226260","2227800"," Do you trade the market up into the right?"
"2228060","2228640"," In the meantime?"
"2228980","2229220"," Yes. "
"2230320","2230960"," You do."
"2231760","2235840"," You look for the dip to be bought at 390 396 390 400."
"2236920","2241580"," And you look for the rest of that Elliott wave three to play out. "
"2242820","2244160"," Because you don't want to get caught."
"2244360","2246600"," If the market does trade up to my point here is this."
"2246720","2248620"," They bought the fucking PE, PE ratio. "
"2249260","2254700"," And if we do just continue to melt up this entire time and you're just like, Hey, I'm fucking"
"2254700","2255020"," short."
"2255980","2259640"," Well, if you've been doing that since January one, you got fucked, right?"
"2260420","2261060"," Let's be honest."
"2262520","2263360"," Let's be honest. "
"2263560","2264200"," You got fucked."
"2264760","2266080"," You probably broke."
"2266640","2271180"," You probably living outside listening to me in a back alley somewhere, right?"
"2271720","2275960"," So just consider that as time progresses here. "
"2276880","2278680"," I'm going to try to reenter this one more time."
"2278680","2278980"," Hold on."
"2282160","2283400"," Just a second here. "
"2294220","2296900"," I guess that point here is there's a lot of noise."
"2297240","2300060"," There's a lot of noise out there that has competing."
"2302320","2305320"," Competing interest that may not be your interests. "
"2313660","2315500"," I didn't buy that PE ratio."
"2316000","2316340"," Wasn't me."
"2317080","2318360"," And more than likely wasn't you. "
"2319560","2320760"," But somebody did."
"2321700","2323340"," Somebody with money did."
"2324220","2325720"," And I remember that time period. "
"2326040","2327040"," I remember in October."
"2327040","2328580"," I remember in June."
"2329020","2329900"," I remember in October. "
"2330620","2331620"," I remember in January."
"2332480","2335560"," Everyone said, Don't buy crash, crash, crash, crash, crash, crash."
"2336240","2337560"," I mean, you listen to that. "
"2338020","2339860"," You listen to that narrative."
"2340980","2345680"," If you if you hadn't listened to that narrative back in June, you hadn't listened to that narrative"
"2345680","2346200"," in October."
"2346840","2349620"," You hadn't listened to that narrative in December, January. "
"2351120","2353220"," And actually put some risk on today."
"2353460","2354560"," You're doing quite well."
"2357960","2361840"," That doesn't mean you don't take profit or that you don't hedge that position. "
"2364180","2365920"," But there's competing interests."
"2366680","2370020"," It doesn't mean you can't go out and buy TLT and add that to your portfolio."
"2370840","2373680"," I do think there is risk here again going back to. "
"2374080","2375500"," Hey, I bought a bunch of fucking."
"2375720","2376500"," I don't know."
"2377020","2378060"," I bought a bunch of. "
"2379460","2380880"," Company XYZ that."
"2382020","2384880"," Was a flash in the pan in the pandemic."
"2385120","2386500"," I'm like, I don't know, man. "
"2387000","2388580"," I don't know if I'd risk that shit."
"2391060","2392380"," Hold on a second here."
"2392860","2393420"," One second. "
"2395340","2396780"," That seems a little risky."
"2413040","2413840"," But if you're."
"2414420","2416200"," If you're like, yeah, I can solid it. "
"2416280","2416640"," All my shit."
"2416740","2419440"," And that's be 500 or I consolidate all my shit into."
"2420080","2420840"," I don't know. "
"2421480","2422740"," B.K.R. or something."
"2424020","2425760"," He's some Berkshire Hathaway shit."
"2426080","2429380"," I mean, there's a bunch of shit that you can put your money into that always comes back. "
"2429560","2430120"," No matter what."
"2430740","2431180"," Right."
"2449330","2451410"," I'm on four or seven P's if you're any of you are wondering. "
"2455170","2458730"," I guess this comes back to like drinking the Kool-Aid."
"2459010","2460550"," Don't drink all the Kool-Aid just yet."
"2461410","2462490"," You know, this is the point. "
"2463070","2467150"," Even if you're a bear, you shouldn't be drinking the Kool-Aid all at once."
"2468130","2470770"," I mean, you can drink the Kool-Aid down to 4,000."
"2471130","2472210"," You can drink the Kool-Aid to 396. "
"2474030","2475930"," But I would definitely be closing up."
"2476450","2481030"," I would be like throwing the cup in the trash and waiting for the move lower from there."
"2481150","2481670"," Does that make sense?"
"2484590","2486330"," I'd be like, yeah, I'm going to take my money and run. "
"2487110","2490490"," And I don't want to see the break below and the rejection and then the next leg down."
"2492570","2494490"," Because ultimately, it's your money."
"2496150","2501450"," Unless you do an internet credit or some shit like that, real money doesn't work like that. "
"2504180","2509720"," What ends up happening most of the time is you end up giving back six figures, seven figures."
"2511660","2517520"," If you're really, I mean, dude, when I've lost that money, it's typically following that kind of"
"2517520","2517820"," shit."
"2517820","2525680"," In real life, you're following some crazy person telling you, this is it. "
"2525900","2526520"," It's the doozy."
"2526700","2528360"," It's never coming back ever and ever again."
"2529500","2531960"," 407 is pretty fat and fucking heavy right now. "
"2537010","2538490"," It should be a good day."
"2538790","2539910"," We should make easy money."
"2540210","2542510"," Today, tomorrow, we should make some easy money. "
"2543410","2545070"," We can get down to 400 and be fucking kick ass."
"2552840","2554540"," So you get my point here."
"2555500","2556720"," Just be measured. "
"2557160","2558360"," If you're a bear, be measured."
"2558660","2559940"," If you're a bull, be measured."
"2561040","2565460"," Know that you're being fed different narratives for different reasons. "
"2572320","2573900"," You can say whatever you want."
"2574880","2578920"," You can say anything you want about this rally was for this reason."
"2579380","2580580"," That rally was for that reason. "
"2580860","2582800"," The only thing that matters in the fucking day is price."
"2586220","2591920"," And you can, you can, all these, all these people out here, like you realize this was for this and"
"2591920","2592560"," that was for that."
"2592700","2595080"," I mean, it's not, I mean, I'm not, this isn't you saying it, Chase. "
"2595260","2596320"," I realize that's not you."
"2597220","2598640"," But you'll hear this all the time."
"2598640","2601980"," Like, you know that this was because of that reason and this was because of this reason and this is"
"2601980","2602600"," because of that reason. "
"2602920","2612100"," The truth is that the actual like fact is that if he had bought the fucking dip on Apple, one"
"2612100","2614820"," 2441, be a rich fucking person right now."
"2615180","2615960"," That's a fucking fact."
"2618360","2620220"," Well, that, that's what it went down to, right?"
"2620760","2621520"," Is that what it went down to?"
"2622500","2623600"," You'd be fucking rich. "
"2624660","2625920"," You know that, that's a fact."
"2627620","2628600"," So how do you bought that?"
"2628800","2630200"," You'd be doing pretty fucking well right now."
"2630400","2633040"," And where we're sitting right now, just today, right now. "
"2633800","2634600"," You're still fucking rich."
"2638420","2639360"," And so that's the point."
"2640860","2642500"," There can be a million reasons in the world. "
"2642500","2644400"," They hear everybody's really, everybody's got a reason."
"2644500","2646400"," A reason for this and a reason for that and every day."
"2646720","2647460"," And we consume it. "
"2647540","2648020"," I consume it."
"2648080","2648620"," You consume it."
"2649420","2651500"," Well, the fact is the price went up. "
"2652720","2658880"," And oftentimes I'll see people on, especially on social media, they'll be like, this is the reason"
"2658880","2659500"," this happened."
"2660040","2660400"," Not you, Chase."
"2660640","2663020"," I'm talking about the people on like making the claims and shit. "
"2663940","2667540"," And I'm like, wasn't this guy just fucking saying that it was going to crash like last month?"
"2668640","2670400"," This guy was just fucking saying that."
"2671180","2673460"," And now he's giving me the reason why it went up."
"2673700","2675160"," It's almost like an excuse. "
"2676480","2677720"," Like, so was that guy's short?"
"2677960","2679660"," Was he selling an idea?"
"2680040","2680880"," Was he selling a service?"
"2680880","2681720"," Was he getting a fee?"
"2682460","2682940"," What was it?"
"2686640","2690560"," All I really wanted to know was, should I have bought Apple at 126?"
"2691240","2693420"," And the answer is, fuck yes."
"2695940","2697920"," Fuck yes, because this market goes up."
"2698400","2700220"," This market goes up over time. "
"2702500","2705680"," Most people with money don't want to sit here in shorts."
"2706060","2706660"," Well, I guess some do."
"2707040","2708220"," Professional traders do. "
"2708580","2713720"," But like some guy out there, some woman out there that has a house and a job or kids or"
"2713720","2715740"," they don't want to worry about this shit."
"2715860","2718760"," They just want to buy a bottom and move on with some."
"2719280","2719800"," Goddamn it. "
"2725560","2726720"," Get back in their bears."
"2736190","2737830"," Should have taken the money to run on that."
"2747100","2750860"," My point here though is most of the market doesn't work like that. "
"2751100","2752400"," You're not going to find a market."
"2752640","2756320"," Most of the time you're not going to find a market where you're like, yeah, I'm going to short down"
"2756320","2758640"," for, you know, 8,000 points."
"2759560","2761480"," Most of the market goes up over time. "
"2761720","2764420"," This is like year over year, decade over decade."
"2765240","2766600"," You typically have better."
"2778110","2780890"," I'm going to put their money into something like grow over time. "

"2796090","2797610"," Middle of 2022. "
"2798670","2801010"," That is a long time ago."
"2801750","2803390"," This market is stabilized."
"2804170","2805130"," This market has stabilized. "
"2806370","2810350"," We've traded sideways right for quite a long time at this point."
"2810790","2817790"," So I don't think most investors want to live month in month out hearing every day that the market's"
"2817790","2818150"," going to crash."
"2821870","2822910"," I just don't. "
"2823190","2827890"," And I don't think the market's going to, and I think if the market does crash, trade sideways like"
"2827890","2828070"," this."
"2829490","2830510"," You're hedging tops."
"2831690","2832990"," You're buying bottoms. "
"2833530","2834670"," You're adding to your portfolio."
"2837190","2838030"," That's all you're doing."
"2838290","2840510"," If you're a bull, or if you're not even a bull, if you're just a market investor. "
"2841690","2843990"," You're just looking for bottoms to buy and hedges to top."
"2844250","2844870"," That's how it is."
"2845110","2845470"," Pretty simple. "
"2846410","2847370"," It's not rocket science."
"2848550","2849510"," It's fairly simple."
"2853530","2860430"," You know, if spy crashes this week and starts a descent downwards, it's more than likely going to"
"2860430","2861110"," come right back up. "
"2862230","2863530"," One, two, three months later."
"2865370","2867430"," And it gives me another buy at a lower price."
"2868090","2871510"," If I can buy spy like $280 a share, I'm going to fucking buy it. "
"2872110","2872790"," I'm going to hold it."
"2877380","2880360"," And I think that happens this year or next year of the year after."
"2880360","2887160"," I think it happens, but until then, when it does happen, it's just a matter of riding it up. "
"2887940","2889760"," You ride it up and you buy the dips."
"2896000","2897500"," You know, I've said this before."
"2897640","2901040"," You're going to look back in one, three, five years and you should be safe. "
"2901520","2903740"," Now, I can't say that about shit."
"2903940","2905860"," Like I can't say it about specific companies."
"2906620","2907500"," I'm not going to tell you. "
"2907640","2910180"," Yeah, you go and you buy AMC or something in five years."
"2910320","2910700"," Come back."
"2912300","2913200"," That's high risk. "
"2914160","2914960"," Any company."
"2915220","2917360"," Any specific company is high risk."
"2917360","2921140"," In says China is willing to enhance strategic ties with France. "
"2923280","2930080"," I think any company from, I think any company, any company is susceptible to that risk."
"2930080","2932540"," Although, I mean, hey, we, you can look back on remember G."
"2932700","2933600"," I was just looking at GE."
"2934860","2936220"," And do any of you remember?"
"2936500","2938620"," And was it 18, 2018 or something?"
"2939280","2943280"," You guys remember when when, I think that was when, wasn't that when Elon was smoking weed with Joe"
"2943280","2943900"," Rogan or something?"
"2944700","2945600"," Tell me if I'm wrong here. "
"2945980","2950640"," I think it was right around the time that Joe Rogan or Elon was smoking weed with Joe Rogan."
"2950700","2951480"," It could be wrong here."
"2952500","2956600"," GE was like crashing and all kinds of bad news. "
"2956760","2957580"," It was horrible."
"2960840","2964160"," And at that time, people were told, don't buy this bottom."
"2964800","2966260"," They were like, don't buy this shit, man. "
"2966420","2967020"," It's never come back."
"2967220","2967920"," It's going to the depths of hell."
"2968140","2968400"," I don't know. "
"2968860","2970880"," But I know now it's not at that price any longer."
"2971080","2971260"," Is it?"
"2971500","2971780"," It's been years."
"2972060","2972580"," Am I wrong in this?"
"2972700","2974100"," Am I just throwing bullshit out there maybe?"
"2974100","2981550"," Maybe I'm spinning bullshit, but I mean, I'm trying to remember shit. "
"2982190","2987450"," I'm trying to remember actually a specific time when I remember GE was like, doom."
"2989130","2989890"," Straight doom."
"2991450","2994450"," And if you had bought that bottom, you'd be doing pretty good right now, right?"
"2994950","2995510"," Fairly good. "
"3000660","3001440"," Does that make sense?"
"3001840","3006560"," So like when you're hearing like the, when you're hearing like, you know, the worst of the worst of"
"3006560","3007880"," the worst shit in a company."
"3007880","3012280"," And if their price gets that low, and I'm saying, you know, don't trust these companies, but even"
"3012280","3012640"," GE."
"3012980","3015820"," I mean, look at, um, hurts. "
"3016260","3017980"," Look at recent ones."
"3018320","3020560"," Hurts would be hurts and luck and coffee, right?"
"3021840","3025900"," All that shit moved over to the other counter market and then just ripped fucking faces off."
"3026060","3028120"," That shit's got thousands of percent at this point. "
"3032710","3033570"," Am I wrong here?"
"3034630","3038010"," If I'm wrong, if any of you guys that are out there that have been trading longer than fucking"
"3038010","3040250"," COVID can just back me up on this."
"3044320","3044700"," So."
"3046260","3047960"," You have to put risk on the market. "
"3047960","3051820"," I don't know if I'd be buying like, uh, Peton."
"3052340","3053980"," I don't know that I'm going to look at Peton."
"3054060","3054680"," Like I look at GE. "
"3058550","3060150"," Um, I know there's still risk."
"3060330","3062850"," Uh, they dot car or the, uh, tech bubble."
"3063150","3064750"," I do remember that timeframe too. "
"3065030","3065950"," I actually remember that."
"3066050","3066990"," I'm not mold enough to remember."
"3067270","3069490"," I was too young at the time, but I remember those companies folding up. "
"3069490","3076550"," Um, but you know, like a Google or a Microsoft, uh, a Walmart and Amazon."
"3077870","3078350"," Mm."
"3079250","3081710"," Probably have a little more wear with all then. "
"3082930","3089210"," Um, you think, and I'm not saying you, I'm not saying that you buy Apple or Amazon or Walmart here."
"3089230","3092910"," I'm saying if they were to crash down to $10 or something."
"3093610","3095930"," Unless there's some kind of fraud that we don't know about. "
"3096890","3100770"," But they're like some mass fraud, which is hard to do unless there's money involved."
"3101390","3103030"," Usually there's money involved with it."
"3103110","3105570"," Cause that kind of stuff, i.e. like crypto and shit. "
"3105750","3106130"," Bank shit."
"3106990","3110770"," Um, you know, they come back."
"3110930","3112730"," These companies actually come back a lot of the time. "
"3114030","3116810"," I'm not talking about fucking Peton or any of those fucking companies."
"3117490","3120150"," Like you have some small company that was doing some shit for COVID."
"3120430","3121150"," They're probably gone forever. "
"3122390","3125230"," Um, you know, somebody brought up in stream the other day."
"3125230","3126770"," Uh, DGLY."
"3127870","3128990"," They're a famous one. "
"3129850","3133230"," Uh, DGLY was a famous company from, I don't know."
"3133450","3135630"," You guys, old school traders here know this."
"3137070","3138090"," Let's bring them up. "
"3138930","3140650"," Actually, a prime example of a company."
"3141630","3143030"," Uh, you probably Google search these guys."
"3144150","3145710"," Probably Google search these guys. "
"3147630","3148890"," Let's do max on them."
"3150770","3153450"," Probably Google search, uh, DGLY."
"3155270","3157230"," And look for articles. "
"3160290","3163110"," Look for articles for them back in 2007."
"3165960","3167380"," And they had explosive growth."
"3168480","3170660"," Like just huge growth. "
"3171800","3173740"," Uh, over the years."
"3174400","3176620"," And they were, they were the darling of Wall Street at one time."
"3178400","3182280"," And you can see, they never really truly came back, did they?"
"3183040","3183800"," Over time. "
"3183920","3186140"," As a matter of fact, I bet you could call these guys."
"3186140","3189000"," I think you could call these guys up on the phone."
"3189360","3191500"," You could probably speak to the CEO of this company. "
"3192060","3197700"," It's probably like five people in a small industrial park somewhere."
"3199000","3201500"," Trading at $3.95 now."
"3203560","3208200"," So a company like this, yeah, you can get fucked, uh, when the market rolls over. "
"3208620","3210980"," You can get fucked in those companies and never come back."
"3212060","3214200"," Uh, so you, you are probably safer."
"3216060","3219820"," In, uh, in a large company or inside of an index. "
"3221240","3222380"," This is a prime example."
"3222600","3224480"," I bet you can find news articles on this company."
"3224940","3226600"," Way, way back in 2007. "
"3226600","3227220"," Look up, look up."
"3227300","3228740"," Just do like Google search for news."
"3229060","3230440"," Do like a decade search for them. "
"3230760","3235640"," Look up like, uh, 2006 to 2008 on DGLY or 2010 or something."
"3236780","3239740"," And I bet, I bet you you'll find articles like in all the trades."
"3240300","3243420"," I bet you'll find CNBC probably did a bunch of shit on them. "
"3246980","3249600"," Probably telling you to go into a million fucking dollars or something."
"3250120","3251540"," A million dollars to share some."
"3252100","3252460"," And they did. "
"3259320","3261500"," So I'm short right, not sure, but I'm long puts right here."
"3261640","3268960"," So it's where my, uh, my, uh, sell the, uh, where my stops are right with that, right with that"
"3268960","3269960"," gold boxes right there."
"3270620","3271440"," You got a five minute chart. "
"3272820","3273840"," Nice cross above here."
"3274780","3275760"," Could still get a squeeze."
"3277680","3278680"," 4074 something in there. "
"3278900","3279700"," Could squeeze up here."
"3285610","3286970"," Let me take a look at the VIX really quick."
"3288910","3290450"," Make sure we're still on track to the lower. "
"3300320","3303920"," Some resistance here in the VIX coming into some resistance."
"3304280","3304720"," I'll show you."
"3310370","3311890"," This has been a pain in the ass right here. "
"3311990","3314130"," This, this place that we're in right now at the VIX."
"3314830","3315570"," A lot of air."
"3320980","3322780"," Let me, let me get that again one more time. "
"3323620","3325700"," It's been kind of a struggle for the VIX to get over this."
"3326200","3327320"," We may have a squeeze here."
"3327400","3329000"," I don't have to make it stop down here. "
"3331640","3333400"," It's just in time here in the VIX."
"3333860","3334960"," It's been a real struggle here."
"3336140","3338860"," Once we broke underneath this, this uptrend. "
"3339800","3343180"," Uh, see it's been sold down, sold down, sold down."
"3343320","3346960"," We're coming right back up into it again for it to get sold down once more."
"3347740","3349700"," We'll see if the VIX can actually break up here. "
"3350620","3352860"," Or if it's going to be told no one more time."
"3353820","3357940"," So you might expect some kind of a pullback here and then we get up here."
"3358920","3359800"," Something like this. "
"3360920","3363740"," So I might have to cut, I might have to cut these loose here in just a moment."
"3365420","3366900"," You can see us already starting to squeeze."
"3367400","3369480"," We'd be expecting some kind of a trade like this. "
"3369620","3370180"," Hold on a second here."
"3373820","3374920"," I'm flat once more."
"3375940","3378200"," Uh, what you'd be seeing in the Spy right now. "
"3381890","3384650"," Squeeze higher and then hopefully get the roll back down over here."
"3386890","3388390"," At least how the VIX is looking right now."
"3397870","3412300"," Let me see what, uh, is Winky"
"3412300","3412600"," in there?"
"3413420","3414380"," Yeah, finally tech dies. "
"3416140","3419880"," Yeah, Winky, thanks for that, uh, for the link with Eric Balcunas."
"3425780","3428280"," Thanks for putting that inside of the stream, brother."
"3440150","3442850"," Let me see what, uh, YouTube is saying here. "
"3445870","3446590"," Yeah, Peton."
"3447630","3451110"," G.E. was in the Hurt Locker for a while and had to redo a reverse split."
"3451330","3452710"," Yeah, it was in the Hurt Locker, right?"
"3454070","3455270"," It was back in the day. "
"3455370","3455990"," It was really bad."
"3460260","3462500"," Yeah, James D is saying I like the disaster trades."
"3462740","3465000"," VP oil spill, VW diesel gate. "
"3465800","3468060"," Buying on bad news as long as it was not products, accusations."
"3468060","3474520"," Yeah, well, the reason I'm bringing this stuff up too is because, um, I was talking to Winky this"
"3474520","3481620"," morning and I was like, you know, when you look at, like last week I was looking at, um, Snap"
"3481620","3482960"," versus NVIDIA."
"3483620","3485520"," And it was the same general trend up. "
"3485960","3489380"," There's, there's this like narrative, like four stocks are holding up tech."
"3490180","3494460"," And I'm like, yeah, but if you put the charts up over, laid over one another, they're fucking"
"3494460","3495580"," trading the same shit."
"3496580","3498500"," So how do you get a leg up in this market?"
"3498740","3505580"," If, if all of tech is trading the same, even though something that's weighted higher or has more"
"3505580","3511840"," market cap is carrying the market and most of tech is riding up, the only way for you to get"
"3511840","3518460"," a deal without everybody else is trying to find right now a company that's counter trend to the"
"3518460","3519560"," market, right?"
"3519560","3525600"," Some, like an, i.e. an example being if, if, uh, the financials are selling off while the market's"
"3525600","3529700"," going up, um, you'll, you have to start at least looking at them. "
"3532260","3532700"," Right."
"3532880","3539540"," So you start looking at those because you might get a value proposition out of those companies."
"3550970","3554050"," I got stopped out, uh, the stuff that puts right here. "
"3561630","3562730"," Yeah, I think we get the squeeze."
"3563010","3564030"," I think we squeeze up right here."
"3566570","3571030"," It looks like Vix is going to need, if you guys saw the Vix, the Vix chart that I just"
"3571030","3577790"," showed you, um, I want to see that, I want to see that hourly come up a little bit more"
"3577790","3578250"," in Vix. "
"3581840","3584360"," Still have some, still have some sellers on the Vix here."
"3591190","3593490"," Need that hourly to come up and try to squeeze above it."
"3611340","3612620"," There's a five minute chart right here. "
"3615020","3626410"," Do you"
"3626410","3627890"," want to take that five minute trade right here?"
"3635620","3636540"," Hey, trade shorts."
"3636560","3637060"," Amen, brother."
"3637140","3637780"," Good to see you. "
"3640240","3640740"," Hi, man."
"3642400","3644820"," I got to show you guys the pictures here."
"3645020","3646760"," Is Mohammed in the stream right now?"
"3647240","3648380"," Is he watching on Twitch?"
"3650820","3652680"," I got like smoke all of my nose. "
"3653220","3653680"," Same here."
"3653860","3654420"," Are you trading shorts?"
"3658880","3660000"," Hope all is well, my man."
"3660440","3662780"," Let me see if I take some pictures of the hat last night. "
"3670480","3672260"," You think this shit's not cheap either?"
"3673100","3674560"," My child is taking pictures?"
"3674940","3675700"," Oh, yeah, that's a good one."
"3683460","3690000"," My daughter, dude, she's, uh, that's not really a good picture."
"3690120","3692300"," I'll have to get better pictures to show. "
"3694420","3698540"," I'll get a better picture of her with a hat on."
"3698540","3714250"," I thought I had a picture of, uh, that player"
"3714250","3715410"," on the team last night."
"3715470","3716690"," I thought I had a photo of him. "
"3731420","3737780"," Man, I might not have taken a good picture of him last night in it."
"3738700","3740500"," Do they suck at taking pictures sometimes?"
"3745900","3748780"," Who, uh, who we got here?"
"3751020","3752520"," Who donated yesterday?"
"3755260","3756880"," Does it help people that donated yesterday?"
"3757320","3757560"," Nick S."
"3758020","3759300"," Miro donated yesterday?"
"3760940","3767040"," Is that a buttery, uh, butter that hat right there for you guys?"
"3767400","3770820"," It's a DC FC hat right there if you can see it."
"3772320","3774540"," I'll have to upload this stuff to the internet someday. "
"3774540","3779540"," Oh, it should be a brief reversal here."
"3779980","3787260"," Nice five minute trade coming up to 407.33. Yeah, Lisa."
"3789280","3790900"," Big poofy hat with a big pom pom. "
"3791140","3794700"," And then I bought them, um, they had never had bignets."
"3794900","3799280"," So I got them bignets and, um, they got a cookie pie."
"3799980","3806360"," And then this pizza guy, this guy was making pizzas and he gave her, he made her a pizza dough"
"3806360","3808740"," face hat to bring into the match. "
"3809960","3811520"," Let's see if I can find that picture."
"3813260","3814200"," I got the girl's food."
"3819970","3821690"," And they made her a pizza hat. "
"3822510","3823590"," I don't know if you can see that here."
"3826250","3829090"," She's wearing a pizza dough face mask of some kind."
"3829850","3831390"," He taught her how to make pizzas. "

"3886980","3890480"," We wanted to at least go once to that side this year and we did it."
"3890620","3892580"," We're like, let's get it out of the way now where it gets too crazy."
"3893300","3894560"," And it was still crazy. "
"3895220","3901240"," Smoke everywhere and, uh, rockest behavior."

"3940920","3944140"," They threw a pizza dough over and she walked around the stadium."
"3946460","3950680"," Yeah, a bunch of hooligans, bunch of supporters. "

"3975060","3976420"," Once again, sellers of the VIX."
"3987300","3987940"," Bullish here."
"3988100","3990520"," It might even be bullish to 408 71, believe it or not. "
"3992320","3996040"," Uh, we could take this trade up to 408 17."
"4002520","4010060"," VIX now trade $19.67. You're going to look for some support on VIX at about $19.50. Maybe you"
"4010060","4010860"," don't get it that high."
"4010860","4012940"," 407 31 or something like that. "
"4022760","4024320"," Yeah, pizza dough ski mask man."
"4024320","4027120"," They were making pizzas and they had her to learn how to make a pizza."

"4053670","4056590"," Yeah, Muhammad's probably celebrating Ramadan right now."
"4057010","4058290"," And we got storms coming through."
"4058470","4059790"," There's one more thing I want to let you guys know. "
"4060510","4061790"," Right now at this moment."
"4062530","4067230"," If, uh, if the stream stops at any moment this morning, I want you to know that I have tornadoes"
"4067230","4069030"," coming through."
"4069570","4072970"," Oh, the neighborhood, right?"
"4073170","4074670"," Not neighborhood, but the area right now. "
"4075990","4078170"," They're coming through from now until 12, I believe."
"4095920","4097680"," Yeah, they mostly have passed us now."
"4098460","4099540"," They look pretty safe. "
"4099880","4101200"," As of right now, we're looking pretty safe."
"4101399","4102840"," They're hammering like middle of the state."
"4107790","4110490"," They're kind of there's kind of skirt and it looks like Chicago. "
"4111450","4114029"," And mid Michigan is getting hammered."
"4114029","4116990"," They kind of they missed somewhat have missed Detroit at this point."
"4119170","4121470"," We have we're under a tornado watch right now. "
"4122149","4124149"," We have more severe weather coming."
"4125430","4126330"," Let me see."
"4134580","4136180"," Yes, Chicago Kalamazoo. "
"4137279","4138359"," India got a little bit of it."
"4139779","4141260"," Right around 12 o'clock."
"4141260","4141920"," We should get hit. "
"4142500","4144479"," 12 o'clock and then one o'clock this afternoon."
"4144720","4148300"," So if you see me go offline at any point, we'll get him selling already."
"4148899","4154899"," Trying to tee off on the spy right here revenge trade and sellers above here. "
"4157859","4162020"," Trying to tee off sell side saying no, we're going down, baby."
"4167649","4170810"," It looks like most of its most of us, thankfully, has missed Detroit."
"4175069","4180890"," Yeah, I've got a I have a in my basement in a back corner of it. "
"4181970","4184630"," Looks like they had built a bomb shelter."
"4185930","4189390"," Way back in the day or something someone modified a bomb shelter."
"4189670","4192790"," That's like a six foot by eight foot room. "
"4194970","4197250"," Got shelving built into it a wall."
"4198210","4202870"," It looks like they filled concrete bricks or something with concrete or something."
"4202870","4205610"," Pretty dense can't hear anything care and echo in there. "
"4207690","4211590"," So if anything happens, I guess that would be the place to go."
"4227740","4229160"," Yeah, it could be that too."
"4230660","4232120"," Detroit's kind of known for two things. "
"4232440","4236540"," I have a buddy that has a house out in Bloomfield."
"4237980","4240320"," And he's got a bowling alley."
"4241620","4242380"," In the basement. "
"4243160","4243920"," Well, it's not a basement."
"4243920","4247840"," It's like a it's like a half basement, I guess you can walk out in the back."
"4248580","4256160"," The front of the house has like it's like a sits up on a cul-de-sac with a round"
"4256160","4256540"," driveway. "
"4257680","4262520"," You walk inside the house and then you go downstairs and there's like a basement."
"4262820","4263640"," That's exposed."
"4263900","4267440"," So you're like coming up to the house drive to the house like this, right?"
"4268220","4270740"," How sits up here and then behind is a basement. "
"4271960","4274300"," That's exposed to the back side of the hill."
"4276740","4279240"," And when you go downstairs, there's a big giant bowling alley."
"4279500","4280060"," It's monster. "
"4280720","4281520"," The house is huge, right?"
"4283060","4288920"," And the guy that he bought it from was an engineer in like the 70s or 60s or something."
"4290020","4295980"," And if you walk behind the bowling alley, there's like the machinery and all that stuff to run the"
"4295980","4296340"," bowling alley."
"4296480","4296880"," It's a real one. "
"4297260","4298460"," Like not a fake, like a real bowling alley."
"4301120","4305640"," And you go into it, you go walk down that hallway and then there's a door, like a steel door."
"4306900","4308520"," And you open that thing up, right?"
"4308760","4311780"," This this door is like it's like a perfect pin. "
"4311800","4313060"," It just opens, right?"
"4313180","4314980"," But you can feel the weight on it, but you can move it."
"4314980","4318060"," You couldn't move it if you try to pick it up or something, but you move it."
"4319540","4323820"," And then you go down this long hallway into the underneath the house. "
"4325120","4328660"," The hill in the front underneath the house."
"4329260","4330760"," And it's a zigzag hallway."
"4331060","4333240"," You go down like one, take a left, take a right. "
"4333500","4335480"," I mean, I was like a left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right."
"4335900","4338920"," And you go through like a 50 foot maze."
"4339760","4341600"," Like 50 feet, maze to the left. "
"4342120","4342460"," 50 feet."
"4342700","4343020"," Take a right."
"4343660","4344280"," 50 feet. "
"4344440","4344800"," Take a left."
"4346440","4347920"," And he has a bunker."
"4348260","4352960"," Like an actual nuclear, like a thermonuclear war bunker in there. "
"4352960","4358080"," It's kind of wild because when you go into those things, they have air circulation systems."
"4358800","4359980"," And you have to be careful."
"4360200","4362100"," And so he, this guy like never goes in there. "
"4362560","4369160"," And so when he took me down there, he had to light a lighter to make sure there was oxygen"
"4369160","4370460"," as he went down the hallways."
"4371600","4375320"," Because you could be just, you know, you don't know if there's not enough oxygen down there and"
"4375320","4376480"," you'll fucking die, right?"
"4376600","4379380"," And not be able to get out before you get down into where that bunker was."
"4382960","4384040"," But this isn't that. "
"4384240","4386820"," This is like some guy built this."
"4386940","4391140"," But on the topic of it being a bootleg seller, Detroit is famous for that stuff."
"4391340","4395880"," Detroit has a bunch of stuff. "
"4396060","4403240"," They have the trade has an underground railroad that was interconnected between homes all across"
"4403240","4403980"," the city."
"4405360","4410560"," Detroit was famous as being a city where if you're an African American, you could come to it and"
"4410560","4411720"," travel to it and find safety."
"4414040","4416740"," And these tunnels were also used during prohibition. "
"4418860","4424680"," And there's a speakeasy culture in Detroit that's famous, that's been institutional here for many,"
"4424760","4426160"," many, many, many, many generations."
"4427140","4428820"," And that actually still lives on to today."
"4429380","4430740"," You can actually go around Detroit. "
"4431560","4432340"," It's a major city."
"4432540","4433460"," It's a big, big-ass city."
"4433740","4440700"," But there are still, for this day, speakeasies where you can go into illegal ones that you can"
"4440700","4444660"," party until, you know, all hours in the night, the morning, six, seven, eight o'clock in the"
"4444660","4446200"," morning, you can go out all night long if you want to. "
"4451830","4452750"," Yeah, the purple game."
"4454530","4460860"," Yeah, I don't think it started out like that, but it became that over time."
"4461280","4466680"," I assume that somebody in the, I assume that somebody in the 50s or 60s read one of those pamphlets"
"4466680","4469300"," or books and they put up a brick wall for it. "
"4471040","4473420"," And they built shelving and all this other stuff in there."
"4476810","4479310"," Yeah, not illegal, just non-government ID."
"4491200","4492640"," Still watching the VIX here. "
"4493280","4495720"," VIX squeezing up higher now, trying to find its legs."
"4499390","4503070"," The U.S. confirms that the State Department has summoned Russia's ambassador."
"4504230","4505590"," Let's take a put again. "
"4513290","4515270"," Let's see if we can catch a reversal here on the downside."
"4531060","4539420"," It's 3.07. Get free daily points, Fibonacci and market profile levels by signing up at to the tick."
"4552100","4592910"," Don't want to see VIX get over like $19.90. I'm going to"
"4592910","4593570"," try again here. "
"4593690","4595110"," I've got a 406 P's."
"4597190","4597770"," 54 cents."
"4602260","4603660"," Try this one more time. "
"4603660","4618010"," I think I'm"
"4618010","4619030"," going to hold them longer this time."
"4619170","4619950"," I'll hold them right up to here."
"4626940","4627780"," There we go. "
"4630040","4631700"," I'll trade in 60 cents right now."
"4631940","4632700"," 61 cents."
"4633880","4634620"," Come on, man. "
"4635700","4636940"," I don't want to do this all day long."
"4637260","4639180"," We only have four fucking days this week."
"4641040","4644900"," Send us down to fucking 400 at least for 396 something. "
"4646380","4647120"," Get to the market."
"4647240","4648100"," Some breathing room, please."
"4670320","4673440"," I'm missing you guys on stream on the chat right now. "
"4680080","4680500"," That's right."
"4680620","4682060"," I'll try to have these hospitals, baby."
"4682560","4686940"," I've got a great trade as a great EDM music festival over here too. "
"4694470","4694790"," Yeah."
"4694970","4695570"," I want us to go down."
"4695850","4696450"," There's no reason. "
"4696710","4697710"," I want us to go down."
"4697850","4697970"," I need."
"4698490","4698930"," Well, not need. "
"4699090","4699390"," I'm a bull."
"4699530","4701510"," I need us to go down so that I can buy a dip in safety."
"4701510","4705730"," I don't want to trade this up like grind up all week long. "
"4705830","4706650"," No, that kind of nonsense."
"4707250","4709810"," So I'm kind of like biased here as well."
"4715200","4716700"," Here you go and trip along here. "
"4719160","4720880"," Trade in 61 cents right now."
"4731170","4734310"," Vix needs to fucking pull up its pants here and start squeezing."
"4736230","4737590"," Needs to trade this life. "
"4737730","4739150"," It needs to trade like 20 40."
"4745690","4746490"," Come on, baby."
"4746830","4747970"," Start raining some money down. "
"4760990","4766830"," Yeah, I was trying to look at the expected move that I had for this morning was the expected down"
"4766830","4767790"," move that I had for this morning."
"4768330","4770690"," What I thought we could trade today was at least 404."
"4772810","4773210"," Chase. "
"4775570","4777130"," At least trade down at 404."
"4777510","4779070"," I'd like to see at least 404 by in a day."
"4779570","4780170"," At least tag it. "
"4781570","4783510"," For 54 somewhere down in here."
"4784250","4785790"," I'd like to see us trade today if we could."
"4787450","4788830"," And then I'd really like to see. "
"4790150","4792650"," I'd really like to see Friday via bloodbath."
"4793590","4797450"," No, I don't know if we get the bloodbath today if we get it tomorrow, but I'd really like to"
"4797450","4799090"," see like Vix into the weekend."
"4800370","4801730"," Trade some nice high number. "
"4803590","4805010"," Get a nice long weekend."
"4808980","4809880"," That's what you got, Danny."
"4810140","4811600"," Yeah, I want to see it today if I can. "
"4820510","4822170"," No, no, no, I never closed Friday."
"4823090","4824370"," I know a long weekend."
"4825430","4826790"," More trading days this week. "
"4827630","4828510"," We have one more day."
"4828690","4833510"," I always said Friday for, I said Friday for, I guess I seriously misspoke and said Friday."
"4834070","4835690"," I meant Thursday tomorrow. "
"4835990","4837150"," I'm hoping that we have a bloodbath."
"4837970","4839370"," Today or tomorrow, right?"
"4839530","4840410"," It should be today or tomorrow."
"4840930","4842110"," Then a nice long weekend. "
"4851850","4852670"," I'm going to say it again."
"4864900","4866220"," Yeah, Friday markets closed."
"4866480","4868160"," We've got Easter and good Friday. "
"4868920","4870520"," Passover, Ramadan, all that shit."
"4875410","4879570"," They just said we had four days this week and they said Friday and you guys were like, Oh, no,"
"4879590","4880250"," no, I got you."
"4882150","4883110"," You guys are hilarious. "
"4894920","4896460"," If we get a great Friday."
"4897040","4899120"," If we get that at three ninety nine or lower at that."
"4899560","4907720"," It'll be in pre market and that'll start ripping it up at seven a.m. Yeah, I got to stop"
"4907720","4908200"," up here. "
"4908960","4910800"," But I don't think I'm going to put it out."
"4910900","4912700"," I think I'm just going to hold on to it for the rest of today."
"4913360","4914740"," I might even just add the position. "
"4917200","4919600"," I think even if they burn it, I don't care."
"4920900","4924520"," I think my bias right now is I want this to come down."
"4925000","4926260"," So I don't care what we squeeze. "
"4930650","4931510"," I'll spend the money."
"4952270","4954210"," The four, five, four, 15s."
"4954230","4954990"," We talked about a Monday. "
"4955650","4957310"," We didn't talk about any four teams of Monday."
"4957390","4960330"," Monday talked about selling the market."
"4961090","4961650"," You guys remember?"
"4962850","4963750"," Monday morning, man. "
"4964010","4965330"," I even posted it right before the open."
"4965510","4967430"," I was like, sell the call side, hold the put side."
"4967430","4969190"," We were in a straddle from Friday to Monday. "
"4970670","4973010"," We fucking owned puts all day long on Monday."
"4973890","4974730"," Don't know what you're saying."
"4989240","4996080"," The Swiss federal council has instructed the federal department of finance to cancel or reduce by"
"4996080","4996680"," 50 percent. "
"4996840","4998140"," Were you guys not here yesterday?"
"4998380","4999200"," We sold the market yesterday."
"4999320","5001940"," Are you guys not here on a Monday?"
"5002100","5002960"," We sold the market."
"5003200","5004100"," Was I not here?"
"5004240","5004740"," It was here, right?"
"5005340","5005940"," I think it was here. "
"5011770","5013190"," The Swiss federal council says."
"5013310","5013930"," That was my idea."
"5014090","5014730"," I think it was great. "
"5014890","5015870"," I had a fucking great day."
"5015870","5017970"," The remuneration already paid out."
"5018270","5021970"," Can be recovered and report the FDA and FINMA on the matter. "
"5022390","5024530"," It was just a process of momentum shift."
"5025550","5028830"," I don't know what the process of momentum shift is."
"5035640","5037220"," Too much public you have to roll until tomorrow. "
"5039660","5041000"," Yeah, I'll just squeeze in right now."
"5041000","5053780"," Yeah, I'll show"
"5053780","5054060"," you here."
"5054200","5054840"," I'll show you guys here. "
"5055360","5056240"," I'm trying to see you."
"5056400","5056800"," I'm not trying."
"5056940","5059240"," I'm not fully understanding what you're all saying right now. "
"5059340","5061080"," I'm like reading Twitch and YouTube comments."
"5061300","5063060"," I'm like, what the fuck are these people talking about?"
"5072620","5073320"," Here's the VIX."
"5077420","5078380"," Let's talk VIX. "
"5079480","5079880"," Ready?"
"5081500","5082980"," VIX is going up here, right?"
"5084160","5085680"," VIX is going up here, right?"
"5085680","5089320"," So we're looking for this hourly support to bring the VIX up here."
"5089940","5092260"," Let's not be, let's not mince words here."
"5092760","5094960"," Inside of the stream chat, I guess. "
"5096540","5099920"," So you're looking for a VIX to break above this orange line."
"5100040","5101580"," I'm going to show you why this orange line is important."
"5102860","5107320"," You want the VIX to at least get this green line to come, push the VIX up and through this"
"5107320","5108300"," orange line right here. "
"5108980","5110900"," So I'm just looking for the momentum they get up there right now."
"5112740","5115300"," And we'll show it to you in the 30 minute one more time here."
"5126210","5127550"," This is the VIX right here, okay?"
"5128390","5130470"," VIX marching up, marching up, marching up, right?"
"5130710","5131850"," Nice fat squeeze in the VIX. "
"5132490","5133210"," Traded below."
"5133730","5139630"," Now, this here is where I think the market rips higher, but this will come over and roll the VIX"
"5139630","5139810"," over."
"5140250","5143910"," But the VIX needs to squeeze up here at least to be rolled over to the downside. "
"5145130","5148790"," So I'm looking for lower lows on the S&P 500."
"5148790","5150530"," I want to see a Bible dip."
"5153560","5157540"," So that's when you hear me say things like, when you hear me say things like, I hope we get"
"5157540","5159020"," a low buy or a Thursday. "
"5160460","5163720"," I'm hoping that we get at least get some kind of a squeeze here on the VIX."
"5165040","5166340"," Because I don't want to trade."
"5167620","5170820"," I don't want to trade this down here if I don't have to, because it's risky. "
"5171240","5174760"," Like a long trade here saying we're going to like 14 into next week."
"5174900","5176100"," I'm like, eh, probably not."
"5176280","5178080"," Probably going to squeeze up probability. "
"5179080","5180300"," We're going to squeeze up."
"5181380","5184740"," Then we can take that nice long trade in the market."
"5185040","5185420"," Makes sense. "
"5186100","5188000"," That's where the long is in the market right there."
"5189260","5190480"," So that's just the VIX."
"5190560","5191580"," What the VIX is telling you. "
"5192160","5196360"," So I'm expecting it today, tomorrow, and we can get that nice squeeze right here."
"5197300","5198400"," These buyers are here."
"5198600","5199880"," They're not in control as of yet. "
"5200300","5204860"," There's a lot of demand here to buy the market right where you are right now."
"5204860","5208760"," And then on the spy though, we're going to look at the spy real quick."
"5212000","5213100"," And this is a rule. "
"5213560","5214980"," Now we're squeezing up right now."
"5215100","5221460"," But even though we're squeezing up right now, so we're squeezing up right now to 408.35. But even"
"5221460","5228220"," though we are, as long as price remains below the hourly trigger, as long as the price remains"
"5228220","5231800"," below the hourly trigger, we're negative on the market."
"5232240","5235960"," And price remains below the one to five and the hourly right now. "
"5235960","5237880"," I'm bearish on this market here."
"5238080","5243020"," So I'm bearish on this move down to, believe it or not, 400 minimum."
"5245380","5250260"," Now if price does reclaim, if price does get above and the one in five minute get up here and"
"5250260","5254360"," confirms the trade is on and we're moving higher, I'll take that trade with you. "
"5254420","5256780"," I'll take the 410 higher trade with you."
"5257060","5260440"," But until then, this looks more like noise to me than anything."
"5261580","5267040"," So as long as, like we're seeing a squeeze right now, right up here, this is that same line right"
"5267040","5267280"," here. "
"5268520","5272920"," Any kind of squeeze above here, to me is just another reason to sell down."
"5273720","5276940"," Unless we can trade above it and I can take that long trade from here."
"5289320","5290660"," Maybe that helps, I don't know. "
"5298290","5299550"," Hey, Mary, what's going on, brother?"
"5302980","5304160"," Somebody deleted your message."
"5308180","5309860"," Let me go over to YouTube chat and find out."
"5313480","5315180"," Mero, make your message again. "
"5316460","5325030"," I don't know how to reply to Mero."
"5334440","5338420"," It could have been a, it could have been a stream labs bot Mero."
"5341200","5341920"," It's a culture. "
"5342380","5349070"," Oh, we're above the five minute."
"5349130","5350110"," I got to take a long now."
"5350230","5351710"," Now I'm fucking straddling the market. "
"5352750","5353430"," Fucking awesome."
"5354390","5355310"," I hate this."
"5355310","5357210"," I hate these fucking days. "
"5358770","5360430"," The last second here, I'm pulling on."
"5366110","5368690"," Now I'm also long, 408 C right now."
"5369410","5375450"," I've got 406 P's for today and I've got 408 C's. "
"5393310","5394330"," Where's Mero at?"
"5394430","5396250"," I don't want to say I'm trying to read comments here."
"5398690","5400190"," Someone too late now."
"5402250","5403010"," Yeah, man. "
"5403170","5405710"," If we stay above here, I'll stay long calls."
"5405950","5406890"," This white line right here."
"5410190","5411230"," Who buys Vix?"
"5411750","5413070"," I don't buy the fucking Vix. "
"5415230","5418230"," I don't fucking buy UVXY or the Vix ever."
"5419970","5421910"," Who the hell is saying all this shit today?"
"5422050","5423350"," All day long, I'm seeing comments."
"5423550","5427430"," They're like not what I'm saying. "
"5427430","5432920"," Oh, yeah, that's what I've got, man."
"5433020","5434320"," I got Vix futures up right now."
"5435000","5435580"," That's what I show. "
"5435700","5436780"," I don't show these guys Vix."
"5436800","5437940"," I show these guys Vix futures."
"5441750","5443810"," Yeah, I show them the Vix futures. "
"5443990","5446230"," I don't show them that bullshit daytime Vix."
"5453440","5454080"," Always Vix futures."
"5458220","5458540"," Yeah. "
"5458540","5458620"," Yeah."
"5465840","5467080"," I don't do that."
"5470770","5471990"," But I use the Vix. "
"5472230","5473710"," I use Vix futures to trade spy."
"5478210","5480290"," Now, UVXY is trash in my opinion."
"5480650","5481430"," Best Vix you can watch. "
"5482250","5483730"," So, Mero's talking about Vix futures."
"5484150","5484630"," That's what I show."
"5484750","5491150"," When I tell you guys pricing, I'm always talking about Vix futures. "
"5491150","5492810"," That shit's useless."
"5497760","5502160"," Tell Mero, Vix ETFs are meant to rob you."
"5507360","5510720"," You guys are giving us better explanation of this. "
"5511000","5517480"," So, you can just go to like trading view and you can look up Vix futures and then compare that"
"5517480","5521880"," price to the ETF Vix and you'll see a huge disparity."
"5530470","5530870"," Yeah."
"5531030","5534950"," If we trade, so price stays above this white line right now, I got to go along the market. "
"5535690","5536170"," No choice."
"5536410","5537070"," I have to counter the trade."
"5543380","5543980"," Hey, oblivious. "
"5544280","5544580"," How are you?"
"5544940","5547340"," Oh, it was a Blivy Ose."
"5553800","5556220"," UVXY got too much money for you before you learned this."
"5567680","5568800"," Apple needs MVX. "
"5568960","5569720"," Yeah, like MVX."
"5570220","5572700"," Apple needs to break under 163 and stay below."
"5572880","5575060"," And we can see spy at 404 if Apple can dump 160. "
"5575940","5576940"," Yeah, I want to see."
"5578620","5579240"," I'm a bull."
"5579440","5582820"," Just say any of you guys know, if you're just tuning in right now, I'm a fucking bull. "
"5584980","5585880"," But I want to buy."
"5587500","5590460"," I want to buy the market at like 400, 396, something like that."
"5591460","5595500"," So my assumption here is we're just dragging ass in this market looking for that. "
"5595680","5599120"," We only have four days this week, so hopefully we can get a move down."
"5599360","5603660"," Hopefully the Vix rips in the, hey, Mero, are you hoping for the Vix to rip, rip faces off tomorrow"
"5603660","5604060"," on Thursday?"
"5604060","5606340"," Thursday with a..."
"5610600","5612900"," Hey, thanks for welcoming obliviousy to the stream."
"5621940","5624500"," Yeah, McDonald's is moving along nicely too, wasn't it?"
"5627190","5628710"," Come on, Vix, baby. "
"5634640","5636380"," Liquidation breaks, liquidation breaks."
"5638360","5640940"," Middle of the day, nonsense in the market right now."
"5645280","5648960"," U.S. confirms that the State Department has summoned Russia's ambassador. "
"5655800","5660660"," I did read that headline this morning from Master saying, I hope we don't tighten until something"
"5660660","5660980"," breaks."
"5661540","5663080"," That gave me a fucking giggle."
"5670780","5672360"," Yeah, I've got a..."
"5672360","5673880"," I'm stacked with puts right now, man. "
"5674360","5675680"," I got a shit ton of puts, Mero."
"5677560","5678880"," I got a shit ton of them."
"5682000","5684600"," I'm loaded to the tits as they say in puts right here. "
"5684780","5687340"," I got some calls, but I'm loaded to the tits and puts."
"5688040","5689360"," I got some calls for a counter trade."
"5690080","5691100"," I've been doing pretty well with that. "
"5692440","5697020"," I've been able to take some nice strangles and straddles in the market and they've been printing so"
"5697020","5699080"," fucking fat that it doesn't matter which way we go."
"5699640","5701080"," Desirative has been really good lately."
"5728330","5735310"," I think there was a time frame where it was better to cut posts on one side and ride the"
"5735310","5735530"," other. "
"5736430","5741510"," And recently, it's just been like, fuck it, I'll just hold both sides until they print Diamond Ham"
"5741510","5742690"," every day."
"5747420","5748380"," Hit to the tits."
"5754420","5755560"," I'm hoping that it's today. "
"5755680","5757700"," I don't know if it's today or tomorrow, but we should get a bloodbath."
"5768300","5770280"," I'm loaded to the tits right now."
"5780160","5781080"," Switching on the cancel. "

"5800620","5801720"," So we had oil hit."
"5801880","5803060"," We had oil utilities hit."

"5833050","5836970"," shares of companies that they expect to turn out outsized profits in the future."
"5837810","5840650"," This is that whole business cycle thing that we talk about here in the stream."
"5841650","5843150"," We talk about the business cycle. "
"5843290","5849070"," We talk about what business cycle, the sector cycles, all that kind of stuff."
"5849750","5850570"," This is on that topic."
"5852090","5859030"," Tech Sox typically thrive in lower rate environments when investors are willing to pay more for"

"5871390","5873430"," credit is likely to tighten as banks retrench."
"5874350","5875050"," That doesn't matter. "
"5876390","5882350"," If you guys look at the corporate debt in this country for companies, it just goes up."
"5882410","5884330"," It doesn't matter if the market's going down or up."
"5884430","5885130"," It doesn't fucking matter. "
"5887010","5889790"," My in my view, big tech companies could give a fine fuck."
"5890670","5892210"," That's a good reason right there, right?"
"5892390","5893670"," The cash rich, the buybacks."
"5898470","5903510"," But Tech Sox are still trading at elevated levels, leaving them vulnerable in the event of"

"6020590","6024410"," all source it, you need to look at AMD for you."
"6027190","6028650"," Oh, look at AMD for you, brother."
"6030810","6032130"," I just like trading AMD. "
"6032890","6035090"," One of the first tech names are traded."
"6038870","6039470"," Ooh."
"6041090","6041690"," AMD. "
"6042550","6042910"," Ooh."
"6046460","6047480"," Oh, man."
"6048780","6050080"," Good shout out. "
"6051100","6052460"," Good shout out."
"6052620","6053420"," All right, Winky."
"6055100","6055700"," AMD. "

"6061430","6063510"," Full is probably panicking right now, right?"
"6063830","6064210"," They got to be."
"6067330","6068870"," Fools and full panic on AMD. "
"6068970","6071950"," Look at that gorgeous pin strike down there."
"6075030","6078850"," Right on the hourly to the tick almost."
"6080330","6084870"," And a bounce at 11 a.m. Ricochet. "
"6087010","6088490"," That's what I'm looking for in the spy."
"6089110","6090870"," This is what I want the spy to do."
"6091390","6094130"," Can the spy just do this for me, please?"
"6094730","6097150"," Just come down and ricochet. "
"6101250","6102910"," It's a beautiful run right there."
"6103010","6103350"," Look at that."
"6107900","6109340"," Gorgeous run right there in AMD. "
"6111400","6112120"," Nice high."
"6112420","6114680"," So down, get underneath the hourly and slam."
"6115640","6118500"," And not only that, the daily is coming up to meet it, which is really nice. "
"6118500","6132190"," Now, with that said, AMD can still trade down lower to $84.74. And"
"6132190","6134970"," down here, $82."
"6135930","6138470"," I'll be looking for $80, $82 on AMD."
"6139590","6141110"," Even if it gets the bounce right here. "
"6144860","6148200"," You've got some stuff on your side here."
"6149120","6154760"," You can buy this dip on AMD at 91.51. Right?"
"6154940","6155900"," You can buy this right here."
"6157340","6166010"," Make that green make this green right here. "

"6174210","6177070"," 92.65 resistance."
"6179250","6181770"," And 95.34 resistance. "
"6184790","6191610"," As long as price stays above the screen box here, 91.50. It's okay if it trades sideways and"
"6191610","6192370"," consolidates."
"6192690","6196870"," The idea here would be it's fine if it consolidates like this."
"6197790","6200710"," Then eventually the hourly comes underneath and it starts to go higher. "
"6201490","6201890"," That's fine."
"6203150","6206290"," It's okay if it trades up here and then rejects back down."
"6206290","6207030"," All that's fine. "
"6207250","6211990"," As long as it doesn't come down below 91.50. The trade is higher at AMD."
"6212470","6218070"," If you start to break down below 91.50 and get a rejection, you're going to be looking for lower"
"6218070","6219770"," lows and that's down to $80."
"6222490","6232250"," Down to 84.70 currently it sits at 85.10. And then 81.73, 81.81 somewhere down there"
"6232250","6233230"," on AMD. "
"6233790","6234930"," Good call out, Winky."
"6235610","6236570"," I like it."
"6237610","6241230"," It does look like it's going to go down to 80 bucks, at least here. "
"6242290","6245210"," The hourly looks strong, so it should be strong today."
"6245530","6248910"," But overall, you'll give you my projection at least."
"6253910","6257470"," Overall, on the daily, it looks like it's going to keep staircase and down. "
"6257870","6263110"," So any kind of strength that you see, you'll likely get a reversal of some kind here."
"6274690","6275390"," It was crazy."
"6275690","6283330"," What I was looking at was, I was looking at the GLD yesterday. "
"6285850","6287310"," We had charted out gold."
"6292630","6295710"," It had a little bit more of a dip than I expected here."
"6296390","6297570"," But it came back down here, dipped. "
"6298790","6301570"," It's trying to just tag above here to that cell zone up here."
"6306130","6308030"," That's the profit taken zone right there in gold."
"6317370","6318530"," You guys remember when we traded?"
"6319050","6320670"," You guys remember when we set this up?"
"6321710","6324170"," Set this back up on Friday. "
"6326230","6328290"," I don't know when we set this up, this chart."
"6332430","6333270"," March or something?"
"6333530","6333930"," Maybe January?"
"6334170","6334550"," I can't remember."
"6336530","6337270"," Somewhere in there. "
"6338770","6341730"," January or March, something like that, we did that GLD chart."
"6348320","6349000"," Nice."
"6356060","6357660"," Oh, you guys don't know that?"
"6358140","6361000"," You guys don't know that Google is using NVIDIA?"
"6361520","6362980"," That was the joke this morning. "
"6365700","6367480"," That was the joke."
"6369120","6371020"," Google fucking uses NVIDIA."
"6371820","6373860"," NVIDIA, that's what I like to say. "
"6376580","6378540"," I like to pronounce it."
"6379460","6380500"," NVIDIA, baby."
"6389300","6390100"," It's not NVIDIA. "
"6391100","6393400"," Sounds like a hand lotion or something."
"6398820","6400360"," Sounds like jerk-off lotion."
"6412320","6413640"," This is our one right here. "
"6414380","6415260"," The rest one, excuse me."
"6415780","6416180"," This is S1."
"6417940","6418520"," This is S2. "
"6420920","6423240"," hourly is now resistance where the sellers are right here."
"6424040","6426320"," There's a gap above the needs that still has been closed."
"6428580","6430240"," As time moves on, I'm watching. "
"6431020","6436200"," As time moves on, I'm watching the put side of..."
"6440640","6442140"," I'm going to say in here, I'm going to read something."
"6442340","6442980"," We have a text coming in."
"6443560","6445720"," Got a nice gap that does need to be closed above. "
"6446460","6451400"," We still have the puts that are coming into the market out of the market day-to-day."
"6452520","6453580"," That was the trap yesterday."
"6463480","6465440"," Like these aren't monthly puts or anything. "
"6465720","6468220"," These are puts that are coming in and out of the market right now."
"6471140","6473040"," They're sitting on 407Ps."
"6475500","6477660"," There's 268,000 of them. "
"6479220","6481400"," So keep her eyes on them as the day unfolds there."
"6482360","6485160"," They're probably not going to want to close below 407 by end of day."
"6486640","6487480"," Same as yesterday. "
"6506500","6512660"," I thought that was a funny post this morning because I was like, when that post came out early"
"6512660","6518760"," morning on Google, I was like, we had a conversation in the past couple days about..."
"6519500","6522200"," If you tell me what the news is, I'll tell you where the price is."
"6524580","6527760"," Like the way that news came out, I was like, get the fuck out of here."
"6527760","6530340"," I was like, you're using this as the reason why it's down. "
"6546530","6547970"," Let me bring this up right now."
"6562110","6562930"," That's what I thought."
"6563130","6566170"," I was like, this is the best negative news possible. "
"6568010","6569390"," That's the same thing."
"6580340","6584020"," It's like that meme where it's like the crazy person meme."
"6591770","6593770"," Just consolidation right now in the VIX. "
"6648420","6652080"," If that spy didn't make a new low, does that mean anything in terms of what?"
"6652260","6657320"," What do you want to know about the need of them be more descriptive in that question?"
"6662770","6664970"," If that spy didn't make a new low mean anything?"
"6666150","6666530"," No."
"6668370","6669610"," I don't know what you mean."
"6670190","6672630"," Let's say I rephrase the question so I get more. "
"6673210","6678010"," You mean like we have a higher low, higher low, higher low, we're going to squeeze or this is a"
"6678010","6678630"," new bull run."
"6680770","6681550"," I'm not sure."
"6683030","6687390"," I think I went over it earlier and told you that we're in cell mode here. "
"6689950","6691030"," Is it a bullish sign?"
"6695250","6696790"," Is it a bullish sign?"
"6697310","6698250"," Not right now."
"6698410","6702050"," So we're in by the dip or we're in solar rip, we're in solar rip right now."
"6703130","6705570"," So we're selling any kind of squeezes that we have currently. "
"6712390","6713770"," Yeah, there's no cross yet."
"6713990","6715370"," On the one minute chart, there's no cross."
"6716870","6719510"," There's no cross here on the upside. "
"6720770","6721830"," Nothing that I can see."
"6721970","6729890"," Everything is, everything is, you know, this is where bearish here."
"6730630","6733070"," This is bearish currently. "
"6733610","6734990"," It's flattening out a little bit."
"6735570","6741490"," The longer we spend trading sideways, we could squeeze up higher, but just another opportunity to"
"6741490","6742550"," sell my view at this point."
"6742950","6747930"," So if you wanted a bullish movie, so being asked if we're bullish right now. "
"6751290","6753590"," So two things that I'm looking for here."
"6753770","6754430"," Are we bullish?"
"6755710","6757590"," No, the hourly is bearish."
"6758370","6760110"," The daily is bearish. "
"6760770","6761990"," Five minute looks bullish."
"6762630","6763810"," The one minute looks bullish."
"6764170","6766070"," So just in here, this is kind of bullish here. "
"6767190","6770210"," Looks kind of bullish, but it's not really telling as much as it."
"6770590","6773130"," If you wanted to get bullish, it's a five minute chart right here."
"6773310","6783250"," If you want this to be bullish, you need to see, we talk about this"
"6783250","6783850"," every day, right?"
"6784070","6784870"," It's a five minute chart. "
"6785210","6788770"," You need to see, you need to see first before you get bullish."
"6788770","6790170"," I can't bullish here."
"6790790","6796990"," You see price not only get above here, but retest to actually get your bullish move. "
"6797250","6798290"," This is bullish here."
"6799630","6800990"," That's bullish right there."
"6802630","6805870"," But all this in here means nothing and is not played out yet. "
"6806530","6811210"," So there's no like, hey, I'm going to cut my puts loose, add to my calls and take this to"
"6811210","6811470"," the moon."
"6813930","6815990"," So there's nothing here for you."
"6819070","6824010"," Just as easily, we can sell off of any of this right here. "
"6824150","6824690"," So just look at this."
"6824850","6826150"," There's a five minute chart right here, right?"
"6826770","6833070"," On any of this right here, even if we do squeeze, they sold it right down, right?"
"6833290","6837890"," Squeeze, sell it down, sell it down, and you're telling me we're going to go up here."
"6838470","6842630"," It'll only be used as more selling pressure into the end of day and into tomorrow. "
"6842850","6843930"," So we're bearish here."
"6843930","6846550"," And we are below the hourly trigger."
"6846870","6851370"," So as long as we're down here, we're bearish, even if we squeeze, we're bearish. "
"6853410","6854290"," That's what it is."
"6854690","6865100"," Now, when you want to be bullish, you want price, like if you want this run right here, if"
"6865100","6868360"," you're saying, hey cap, are we bullish?"
"6870360","6875560"," The hourly trigger was underneath and the price is above the one in five minute on a five minute"
"6875560","6875800"," chart."
"6875800","6877380"," And you see we're bullish. "
"6877520","6881580"," We're buying dips, buying dips, buying dips, buying dips, right?"
"6882040","6883800"," Until we break below the one in five minute."
"6883940","6886620"," First time we broke below the one in five minute."
"6886820","6889280"," And then the hourly was, I believe, yesterday, right?"
"6889540","6890720"," Monday and then yesterday. "
"6893580","6899100"," So when you're selling this stuff down, we're in sell mode right now until we can regain above."
"6899720","6900440"," Does that make sense?"
"6901380","6906560"," So your stance right now, anyone asks you, what is your stance right now?"
"6906560","6907080"," It's bearish."
"6907460","6908360"," It's sell the rips. "
"6909420","6911380"," And we're looking for a bottom to buy."
"6911660","6916720"," We're below the hourly, so we know the true real next bottom is 400."
"6917420","6918280"," That's what we know. "
"6920560","6921380"," Does that make sense?"
"6921600","6922480"," I don't know if that makes sense or not."
"6923200","6924440"," I got to dance."
"6924840","6925940"," I just need more clarification. "
"6928920","6930700"," Like are we bullish here?"
"6930700","6934720"," I guess the question becomes too is, can I make a five minute trade up here?"
"6934920","6935300"," It's possible."
"6936820","6941660"," Any of these small trades in here, like in a one minute chart, are possible, right?"
"6941780","6942540"," You can make like a minimum."
"6943080","6948700"," On this stream, I don't do it anymore with people because people would like to enter a call right"
"6948700","6950800"," here and trade this up right here. "
"6951000","6951740"," Like just here to here."
"6951840","6952300"," I'd enter a call."
"6952680","6956940"," I mean like in and I'm out and someone would enter the call like right here. "
"6956940","6960500"," And then they would, they would, I'd be getting out as they were like, as we were rolling over."
"6961000","6964660"," And so they'd be like flat on the trade or down a penny or something like that."
"6964800","6967280"," So I don't bother with these and streaming along with people. "
"6967440","6970220"," So we trade the five minute here."
"6970340","6978320"," Now, mostly a lot of people still trade the one minute here, but right now we're bearish."
"6979720","6981620"," And I'm taking a counter call trade. "
"6982180","6983300"," So here's the examples."
"6983300","6985440"," The five minute chart, right?"
"6987120","6988900"," So I've got a straddle on right now."
"6989120","6990060"," Well, a strangle is straddle. "
"6990420","6991400"," It's not really a straddle."
"6991480","6992260"," It's not really a strangle."
"6992480","6993040"," It's a zero date. "
"6993200","6994220"," So that's be kind of close to the money."
"6994860","7001060"," So if I get squeezed up here at any point or squeezed up here at any point, I'm going to"
"7001060","7006300"," monetize the call side to pay for the puts that I had and hold those puts into the bell or"
"7006300","7007240"," rest of the day, right?"
"7007480","7010300"," So I'm flat now and my winnings for the day are losses for the day."
"7010300","7012300"," And a little bit of maybe a make 10% or something. "
"7013320","7015520"," And now I have free puts for down below."
"7016460","7022440"," So as long as we're trading, take this as a general rule, not like hard and fast, but on a"
"7022440","7025580"," five minute chart, the twenty seven EMA."
"7026480","7030380"," If we're trading below it, you're bearish. "
"7032680","7038080"," Not like a hard rule, but if you're trained below it, we're bearish."
"7039540","7041080"," Until we trade above it."
"7041560","7042840"," Now, let's say we do trade. "
"7042900","7044760"," Let's say you're in a bearish position like I am."
"7044880","7045920"," I'm in bearish position, right?"
"7046860","7049880"," We start trading up here and we get above the white line."
"7049900","7054920"," I'm going to take the opposite side of the trade to cover my true short position here. "
"7055720","7060780"," So once we do reverse back down, I'm going to get paid and I've got protection to the upside here."
"7061920","7066020"," Let me see if I can find that paper on this for you guys."
"7066340","7068660"," Dan, let me see if I can send you a paper real quick. "
"7068760","7068920"," Hold on."
"7071920","7072960"," Let's see if I can send you this man."
"7075280","7076100"," Give me a second here. "
"7076140","7076680"," I'll look for it."
"7087740","7088020"," Nope."
"7088260","7089420"," That's the tax evasion paper. "
"7093080","7096120"," Well, let me take a look around here, man, see if I get it somewhere."
"7103650","7105390"," Volatility is an asset sale."
"7105610","7105650"," Nope. "
"7105870","7106270"," Not that one."
"7110610","7111270"," What's this?"
"7111530","7111690"," Porn?"
"7112010","7112110"," Nope."
"7112550","7112970"," Not that one. "
"7115330","7115890"," Whoa."
"7122300","7122940"," Let's see."
"7123060","7123500"," I'll find it. "
"7124580","7125560"," Left tail hedging."
"7125920","7125960"," Nope."
"7126180","7126540"," Not that one. "
"7138050","7140410"," Log in for feet pictures."
"7140770","7140810"," Nope."
"7141410","7141770"," Not that one. "
"7147900","7149040"," Welcome to Generates."
"7149260","7149340"," Nope."
"7149480","7149920"," Not that one. "
"7151220","7152080"," We'll have a second here."
"7152140","7152560"," I'll find it."
"7157030","7158370"," I got some for your brother. "
"7158510","7159010"," Just hang tight here."
"7167770","7169090"," Oh, this is one of my favorites here."
"7169250","7171010"," Offensive pit trading hand signals. "
"7172630","7175410"," I'll show you all this new tab."
"7176030","7177110"," I'll show you guys that one."
"7177230","7177630"," That's a good one. "
"7179950","7195100"," I don't"
"7195100","7196620"," know where the fuck this white paper is."
"7199320","7200900"," I don't know why I can't find it."
"7206770","7207370"," Oh. "
"7208490","7209890"," Come on down, baby."
"7212960","7214700"," Come on down, baby."
"7215680","7216940"," Come on down. "
"7218240","7219580"," Don't screen or nope."
"7219680","7220120"," Not that one."
"7224770","7226050"," Let me see here. "
"7226510","7228450"," Where is this fucking thing for you?"
"7229430","7230330"," Python coding."
"7230610","7230690"," Nope."
"7237950","7239670"," Where is this fucking thing?"
"7247550","7248130"," Come on. "
"7254340","7254820"," Come on."
"7254960","7255420"," Start bleeding."
"7260010","7261910"," There is this fucking white paper. "
"7263650","7269100"," I haven't been meaning to look for it anyways."
"7269440","7270760"," I've got a kicking around somewhere in here."
"7271640","7272600"," I said I dig for it. "
"7285550","7286470"," I'm just saying here."
"7293060","7299620"," Man, like do you have any of you guys at home when you, uh, I bookmark a bunch of shit."
"7299760","7301840"," I'm like, I'm going to go back and look at that some day. "
"7301840","7303700"," And then I'm like, yeah, never going back there again."
"7304400","7307040"," I'm just going to store that shit in the bookmark folder."
"7307040","7308080"," So, oh, I got it. "
"7308340","7308880"," I found it."
"7309120","7309940"," I found it."
"7313240","7314600"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"7316440","7316840"," Whoo."
"7318080","7318700"," I found it."
"7320320","7324140"," Oh, here's your, here's your, here's your nugget today, boys and girls. "
"7326680","7327080"," Okay."
"7331600","7333160"," Oh, I got you guys covered."
"7333280","7334800"," You guys want a treat for today?"
"7336520","7338100"," What's that bookmark back up for you?"

"7641880","7645480"," I want you to read that paper because it's not the full thing. "
"7645640","7652440"," It's not the full thing that you're getting from us, but that is people trade a similar system."
"7652920","7655380"," That system is similar to what we trade here."
"7663850","7665030"," Something's going on right now. "

"7785660","7788620"," Read that paper because it's partially what we do. "
"7789420","7795760"," At least on the five minute and the one minute trading the, I believe he trades the 27."
"7796800","7798000"," I don't know exactly what he trades."
"7798380","7801200"," I don't remember the paper at this point, but I know that I traded a similar style. "

"7824980","7828020"," When you read that paper, try to read the entire thing."
"7829060","7834500"," What I find is that people, I was, I mean, a comment once Jedi Marcus had put someone, I think"

"7836840","7839400"," And I was like, and he was like, this didn't work. "

"7844720","7845680"," He read the fucking paper."
"7846920","7850820"," He like read the paper and only took what he wanted from it and said, oh, fuck the rest of"
"7850820","7850940"," it. "
"7852180","7856760"," And you have to read the entire paper because it talks about taking both sides of that trade."
"7858340","7863500"," Either owning the underlying or puts calls, whatever you want to do selling calls, buying calls,"
"7863500","7864300"," doesn't fucking matter."

"8443960","8448900"," And I'm like, yeah, that actually that improves my odds that we're not having a bad Q2."
"8449620","8450060"," Sorry."
"8450820","8451780"," If Q2 was good. "
"8452600","8458700"," And so this Q2 is usually one of our strongest or the end of Q1 and the front end of"
"8458700","8460740"," Q2 is usually our strongest time of the year."
"8461620","8463800"," And last year it was horrible."
"8464940","8465840"," It was a disaster. "
"8467740","8476880"," But historically, if you have one of those bad May, June's, if you throw a really bad one out"

"8519940","8522580"," They started out at 410 and then they switched over to 408. "
"8523880","8527600"," Well, at the end of the day, they closed 408, right at the fucking bell."
"8528320","8531420"," Like 15 minutes for the close yesterday, they just started closing them."
"8531640","8534520"," Like hundreds of thousands of puts just got closed all at the same time. "

"8609900","8611780"," Looking like we're going to get a bloodbath here."
"8613400","8615100"," One minute chart, bearish."
"8619230","8621030"," That was a big sell right there, man. "
"8621490","8623630"," Look at that red line right there on."
"8624870","8627870"," It's just like, that's the floor right here."
"8627990","8629310"," This pretty much the floor right here. "
"8630930","8632110"," This is the floor."
"8640940","8642080"," It's rug pull it."
"8644540","8646280"," Come on, just rug pull it, man. "
"8663620","8664460"," Just rug."
"8665660","8673270"," Yeah, I don't see."
"8673350","8675130"," I don't see no buy orders below. "
"8676190","8677350"," That looks like the rug."
"8677670","8679810"," Did you see that big giant red bar there was?"
"8680030","8682250"," They just sold right into all that shit."
"8683030","8684990"," There's nothing holding up the market right now. "
"8685690","8686610"," There ain't shit."
"8688950","8690170"," There's nothing hold this."
"8690350","8692690"," If you rug pull this right here, it's going to start blasting. "
"8699740","8706900"," Dude, if we bought, well, so that's one other problem."
"8707180","8714720"," If we if we bombed the 400 quickly, maybe normally would take a couple days for consolidation to"
"8714720","8715460"," start ripping though."
"8715780","8719580"," If we bomb today at 400, it could take like two or three days. "
"8719580","8726280"," If we staircase down that bullshit for two or three days, yeah, you can buy the last capitulation"
"8726280","8727000"," move likely."
"8729100","8730180"," It's all about time."
"8730800","8732560"," Time that it takes to actually get there. "
"8735490","8740230"," If we stair stepped down, there's a last capitulation ripped through to like last 40 points or"
"8740230","8740590"," something."
"8742350","8743770"," You could probably buy that dip."
"8744090","8749670"," If we were to run down to 400 today, like right now at this moment, you more than likely couldn't. "
"8749730","8751170"," It would take days of consolidation."
"8753570","8754530"," Kind of suck."
"8768780","8771600"," On spy, there's almost nothing until 380. "
"8771980","8776380"," No, we've got huge support at we have monster support at 400."
"8777160","8782760"," 400 to 396 is like we need something to go through that shit."
"8784240","8785880"," That's where a trend is right now. "
"8785880","8786640"," That's the bull."
"8786640","8789400"," That's the bull trend is 396 to 400."
"8790140","8791400"," That's the actual trend. "
"8816920","8818720"," Yeah, cues have more down to go."
"8818980","8824720"," Cues can go all the way down to 307.13. 307.13 in the cues."
"8834000","8838700"," Yeah, so Winkie is basically telling these guys like basically here's the deal. "
"8838900","8843880"," Like if you like if you start stacking up like a May April or an April May, if you stack"
"8843880","8850120"," up like a bad April May for like one or two years, your chance of having really good years is"
"8850120","8851120"," it just improves."
"8856860","8859200"," Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't find them effective."
"8859680","8861700"," Some of these markets are really easy to trade. "
"8862540","8866040"," Some of them not so much like this bullshit right here is pissing me off all morning."
"8866920","8870020"," Like all this nonsense right here is just killing me here."
"8870160","8871440"," It's all just fucking killing me. "
"8871500","8873980"," I need a moment of capitulation to get paid here."
"8874660","8876560"," Otherwise, I'm just getting ground out here."
"8877600","8878740"," It's like a day like today. "
"8879100","8885180"," If I wasn't streaming a day like today, I'd probably play some puts and just turn the laptop off"
"8885180","8890280"," and come back at 330 and wait for the rip lower."
"8898590","8900070"," Some put spreads would be nice too."
"8901050","8904130"," Put some put spreads on and just come back on Friday or something in a day. "
"8914280","8919120"," Yeah, I don't, you guys, I've already shown you guys where support is the market."
"8922100","8926100"," The only way that Apple's done is if the trade's below like 126 or something."
"8926540","8933380"," I need Apple to break below. "
"8933580","8935100"," I think it's 126 or something like that."
"8936300","8938940"," I need Apple to dump like what?"
"8939240","8940560"," Is that 30, 40 fucking points?"
"8941040","8942160"," That shit split how many times?"
"8943240","8944180"," I don't know, 100."
"8944500","8945900"," I'm exaggerating right now. "
"8946280","8948160"," 26, 27 splits or something."
"8949300","8950600"," I don't remember what it is anymore."
"8951020","8952200"," I haven't traded Apple in a couple of years. "
"8964340","8972920"," I'm not saying this is going to happen, but these kind of days like this, you'll sit here like all"
"8972920","8981300"," afternoon and then it finally blasts down to the patient."
"8984140","8985180"," Yeah, I use Elliott Wave."
"8987480","8990820"," I write indicators that Elliott Wave all the time. "
"8991780","9001220"," I'm not a practitioner of it or anything like that, but I follow it close enough to know that we're"
"9001220","9002300"," likely going to get the dip bot."
"9002900","9007780"," We're likely going to continue higher until until 496 is broken."
"9008080","9011460"," That trade higher on the third wave right now is in play. "
"9018710","9024030"," Well, 396, 400 or time passes, one or the other, and then we should continue on higher."
"9031060","9036180"," I think what Elliott Wave for me is that it's not there's a lot of eraser using an Elliott wave"
"9036180","9042340"," like you're constantly erasing and rewriting if this then that kind of stuff."
"9042640","9044020"," So I pay attention to it enough. "
"9052420","9054040"," Yeah, I'm already bored today."
"9055060","9055900"," Maybe I'm just tired."
"9055920","9056460"," I can't tell. "
"9057140","9058780"," I was out pretty late last night."
"9059260","9061920"," I wasn't drinking or anything, but I had a few bears."
"9062540","9066580"," I did have some had some IPAs last night, two or three IPAs. "
"9067740","9069740"," And that shit's like drinking a fucking meal."
"9070200","9071580"," Like I can't drink that shit."
"9072880","9074560"," It's like nice beer, expensive beer. "
"9075600","9079240"," One or two of those things and I'm fucking done."
"9079420","9080980"," I feel like I ate a fucking entire meal."
"9081840","9083880"," That's why I like PDR is it's like drinking water. "
"9084120","9085880"," You can have like three or four or five of them and you're fine."
"9086720","9088080"," You know, like they're like near beer."
"9088460","9090080"," They're not real, not a lot of alcohol in them. "
"9090080","9092700"," You can drink them in a hot summer day or something after some hard work."
"9093860","9096520"," Like I don't know, maybe it's them getting older or something."
"9097220","9099200"," Like when I drink like expensive heavy bear. "
"9100160","9101180"," I'm like, fuck this."
"9109390","9110950"," They're testing your bear faith here."
"9116230","9117310"," Yung in the head, yeah. "
"9120630","9126090"," When I figured out that PDRs have like barely any alcohol in them."
"9126710","9128590"," So I'm like, ah, I can drink this bear here."
"9128590","9131090"," And you know, I'm not getting fucking shit based. "
"9132170","9133710"," I like this flavor of bear."
"9134310","9136950"," I like the act of having a bear."
"9141900","9145440"," Favorite cocktail, right now for urban rye. "
"9146200","9146840"," Like a Manhattan."
"9151790","9153630"," But I don't even drink as much as I used to."
"9153710","9154170"," I stopped drinking. "
"9154370","9156930"," I like a rare drink."
"9157150","9158870"," If I'm like, if I'm worn out."
"9159930","9165310"," Or if I felt like something not like you're in your, your ego is like, you just finished something. "
"9167750","9172050"," It like, you know, like you're any guys hike or bike or do anything athletic."
"9173870","9176970"," And you'll be like, I have, you like, you have to walk 20 miles."
"9177610","9180030"," And right when you hit the 20 mile mark, you just stop. "
"9180190","9181090"," You're like, I'm fucking done."
"9183070","9183430"," Right."
"9183590","9186050"," But up until that 20 miles, you're good to go the entire time. "
"9186170","9188310"," It could be 10 miles, 15 miles, 30 miles."
"9188490","9189270"," It doesn't fucking matter."
"9190570","9193110"," But once you hit that point, you're like, you're done. "
"9193230","9193650"," You did it."
"9193950","9194670"," It's time to take a break."
"9194670","9196190"," I still have a whiskey then. "
"9196470","9198430"," So like if there's something big that I'm like, I finished."
"9199530","9200690"," I'm like, I'm going to get drunk."
"9201730","9202670"," I deserve it. "
"9206710","9207070"," Yeah."
"9208630","9209650"," I like a good beard."
"9209810","9210250"," Don't get me wrong. "
"9210450","9210690"," Like that."
"9210930","9212130"," So I had a couple last night."
"9212870","9216170"," I had a couple IPA and I had a heavy. "
"9218010","9219910"," Well, I thought it was to me, it was heavy."
"9220910","9221730"," It wasn't an IPA."
"9221730","9224490"," It was some kind of a, a blonde that was heavy. "
"9224890","9225490"," I think it was a blonde."
"9226210","9228290"," It was like, oh, this is going to be a light bear and it wasn't."
"9228410","9228930"," It was pretty heavy. "
"9231510","9232990"," And I just couldn't drink."
"9233190","9235130"," I like, I had to sip it too."
"9235230","9239790"," It wasn't like, yeah, I'm going to drink this bear and it's a light bear and it keeps me hydrated. "
"9240150","9242710"," I ended up pounding water last night, pounding water all this morning."
"9242910","9244090"," I was dehydrated from it."
"9246690","9249030"," I'm definitely not knocking on quality bear. "
"9252690","9254010"," And I like wine too."
"9254630","9261070"," I'm not, I'm out of the phase of drinking wine, but like, um, a lot of the after World War"
"9261070","9263250"," II, you guys know a lot of wine out there or not."
"9263550","9264830"," So I like, I love wine. "
"9265750","9272490"," So after World War II, there was so much destruction in World War II and people were so"
"9272490","9273010"," impoverished."
"9274210","9279390"," All of Europe was, was very impoverished after world, the initial ending of World War II."
"9279750","9281790"," There's a lot of destruction of vineyards. "
"9283170","9290690"," And a lot of European countries planted new grapes or new vines or grafting old vines from"
"9290690","9291270"," destroyed fields."
"9291550","9293790"," And they made a lot of cheap wine that was really good."
"9294570","9296630"," Inexpensive wine, but high quality shit. "
"9297770","9303470"," So I'll seek out a, I'll seek out some wines that you have to order, special order and stuff about"
"9303470","9304390"," some Spanish reds."
"9304470","9307070"," I like, I like German whites."
"9307950","9313950"," Matter of fact, I, when I would finish with my wine and stuff, I really enjoy like German whites"
"9313950","9317010"," and, uh, uh, Spanish reds. "
"9321650","9323370"," Not hard to find type of stuff."
"9324810","9330090"," And as a matter of fact, past few years, I only really, I really, I really drink anything but"
"9330090","9330690"," bubbles."
"9331110","9332770"," I love, I still love shampers. "
"9333410","9337690"," I love shampers and I still love just sparkling wine."
"9338830","9341970"," Not American shit, all, all European stuff."
"9343670","9345630"," I can't stand American wine. "
"9347450","9350030"," It's garbage, generally speaking."
"9352370","9353950"," Kind of a wine snob."
"9355030","9362370"," But saying that I'm a wine snob, if you get into like a good wine shop or something, you can,"
"9362490","9366710"," you can, um, you can request some cheap ass stuff from Europe. "
"9367150","9369010"," It'll blow away most American wines."
"9372260","9377040"," For a great pricing, like 15, 20, the Spanish reds, no, those are run you like two, three hundred"
"9377040","9377240"," bucks."
"9378200","9382300"," But not like thousand dollar US bottles of wine and stuff like that. "
"9386880","9388220"," Yeah, I used to drink Stagg's Leap."
"9388760","9391940"," I used to drink, I can't say I didn't have like a wine phase in American wine."
"9392160","9392360"," I did. "
"9392880","9398100"," I drank a lot of American wine at one point, but, uh, once, once I got out of opened up"
"9398100","9401260"," and I was able to experience different wines, I was like, yeah, I'd rather have this stuff."
"9401380","9402880"," And the price point is better too."
"9405990","9407050"," Hell yeah, Thunderbird. "
"9407670","9411950"," I actually was one of the first, but I didn't have the bottle, but I did taste that once when"
"9411950","9412450"," I was a teenager."
"9413410","9414390"," That shit was the nasty."
"9415590","9416390"," Tasted Thunderbird. "
"9417210","9418990"," When I was a kid, I tried Thunderbird."
"9419170","9421210"," Well, of course, you're still your father's, uh, slow gin."
"9421870","9423090"," Like the shit that nobody drinks. "
"9423530","9424690"," Like I'm gonna go in there and try that."
"9425510","9426710"," Nobody is never gonna notice."
"9428270","9429090"," I was right. "
"9429350","9430770"," It was because nobody drinks slow gin."
"9430770","9438230"," And then I think the first three things I tasted when I was a kid was a mad dog 2020."
"9439550","9448290"," Thunderbird and then I tasted, um, I had a cousin whose friend was like trying to be a tough guy"
"9448290","9452810"," or something and he had a bottle of something called Crazy Horse. "
"9453210","9454890"," I think it was like a malt beer or something."
"9455590","9456910"," It was absolutely dog shit."
"9457190","9459070"," It made me want to throw up everywhere. "
"9459070","9463830"," It was like a three day old can of Budweiser warmed in the sun with a cigarette put out and"
"9463830","9464710"," it was disgusting."
"9466150","9467630"," Oh, I've had Boonsberry too."
"9467810","9470890"," That's a girl that I think I remember like, I think it was a young guy. "
"9470990","9473170"," People would be like, get some boons farms for the girls."
"9473530","9474090"," They'll love that."
"9477770","9479090"," Girls love that shit. "
"9483770","9485030"," Yeah, I love pasta rebels."
"9485970","9486870"," I've drank it."
"9487010","9488390"," I've drank most wines out there. "
"9488970","9492410"," I've tasted most labels that you've seen."
"9493050","9494130"," I mean everything."
"9503210","9504290"," That's a chick wine. "
"9505330","9506610"," Fucking kids are stupid."
"9513110","9514270"," She'll love that drink."
"9515210","9518090"," Get her a fireball or a lemon drop or something, right?"
"9518350","9519510"," Then you think you're growing up. "
"9519630","9522250"," You're like, just buy up all lemon drops to love that shit."
"9523370","9527510"," And of course guys are like, I'll take a shot of your finest jagermeister."
"9528510","9535150"," Yeah, I like champers from France. "
"9535450","9536250"," It's a little overpriced."
"9536810","9537450"," You can get better."
"9538090","9542070"," You can get pretty decent stuff from the rest of Europe. "
"9543690","9545270"," Italy's got some great sparkling wine."
"9546470","9552670"," And dude, seriously, at this point, I've drank so much wine that what I like about champers is that"
"9552670","9553750"," it's clean, it's light."
"9554810","9556610"," I fucking love a good rosé. "
"9556870","9559150"," I don't mean that American bullshit rosé either."
"9559350","9560290"," That's all French too."
"9561690","9565970"," And you got to drink that like the rosé better be drank by the end of the summer that it's"
"9565970","9566110"," released. "
"9566650","9568350"," Like don't be drinking two three year old rosés."
"9568990","9570650"," You drink that shit right when it's released."
"9571250","9572270"," You make sure you drink all of it. "
"9576180","9578840"," Yeah, man, jagermeister's nasty shit too, right?"
"9579520","9582100"," Or I guess the American version's even nastier, isn't it?"
"9582880","9587840"," Isn't there like one of these fireball in Europe doesn't have antifreeze in it, but fireball in the"
"9587840","9589140"," U.S. has antifreeze in it?"
"9589380","9589800"," Is that right?"
"9590740","9594880"," Maybe somebody can validate that or if you're making up shit just talking shit right now."
"9596760","9597920"," Yeah, I used to like Mark West."
"9598100","9598600"," That's good stuff. "
"9599340","9603020"," I used to, kids, look, if you're experienced with American wines, I get it."
"9603660","9607140"," Because that's what my experience was American wines, generally speaking."
"9607960","9611340"," And then you meet, you have to find yourself a local wine shop if someone knows what they're doing"
"9611340","9612640"," and they'll take you down the path. "
"9612840","9614400"," And you're like, oh, it's never going back again."
"9617970","9619230"," Oh, dude, Zima's."
"9619570","9619770"," Oof. "
"9622030","9623190"," I've had lacrima too."
"9624010","9624850"," Yep, I've had lacrima."
"9625250","9625390"," Absolutely. "
"9626970","9628650"," There isn't many wines that I haven't had."
"9629050","9630310"," And high-end stuff too."
"9630910","9633590"," I've drank some very expensive burgundy's. "
"9634890","9637250"," $15,000 bottles of burgundy's shit like that."

"9691740","9692180"," That's my favorite. "
"9692340","9693620"," The rest of them taste like scotch."
"9694280","9696440"," Or like single malt scotch to me."
"9698240","9704800"," The one cool part about them is they taste a lot like you think that you're tasting the woods of"
"9704800","9706220"," the deep south. "
"9707160","9708660"," Like the wood on it is amazing."
"9713320","9718420"," If I wanted a good single malt, I'd drink a single malt on the higher year stuff, 20 year."
"9718760","9723100"," It's like 2018, 12, and 10, maybe wrong in the years, but I think that's what they are. "

"9835700","9838000"," I've had real moonshine twice in my life. "
"9838200","9839700"," The rest of it's been fake moonshine."
"9840180","9841640"," Not fake, but it's been produced."
"9842220","9843860"," But I have that moonshine twice in my life. "
"9847890","9850230"," Yeah, old Forester, that's some great bourbon too."
"9850590","9851990"," Thank you, that's a good bourbon right there."
"9852250","9852910"," Old Forester, man. "

"9870920","9871500"," I'm like, nah. "
"9876150","9880370"," I don't drink plum wine, but I do drink Japanese bourbon."
"9880750","9882750"," Well, I drink Japanese knockoff bourbon's."
"9883450","9884850"," And I like saki too. "
"9885870","9890290"," I like cold filtered saki, and I like unfiltered."
"9890310","9893390"," Sometimes I like unfiltered here and there."

"10278090","10278610"," that kind of stuff."
"10278890","10283410"," Like toilet paper, uh, soap, all that sort of stuff. "
"10283570","10284330"," So that's on the trip."
"10284890","10286510"," It's a pretty big fucking trip, right?"
"10286710","10287650"," Like all those different stores."

"10323360","10324340"," Uh, it's worth it."
"10324520","10326220"," Still worth it for us for the, uh, gas. "
"10327000","10330920"," But we didn't like how much this is going to make this guy sound crazy."
"10330920","10333580"," So we'd go to Costco."
"10334320","10338280"," Well, the two things we liked most about Costco was getting a cheap pizza for like 10 bucks. "
"10338960","10342340"," It was serviceable if we were like shopping around town or something."
"10343160","10344520"," And the gas is really cheap."
"10344940","10346620"," Now we only have one gas vehicle. "
"10347640","10353420"," And when we go there, we get shit and it either goes bad or it's too much for us."
"10354600","10360900"," Like we'll just sit there and we spend so much fucking money on shit that we don't ever get."
"10360920","10363660"," Through their liquor prices are good there. "
"10364520","10368500"," Like I'd go there and be like, I'm, I'm like, I don't want to buy like, I don't want to"
"10368500","10370620"," buy fucking 60 muffins."
"10375860","10379180"," Yeah, yeah, my wife does."

"10398340","10399560"," Kirkland brand Porto is good."
"10399680","10401500"," I haven't had the Kirkland band Porto."
"10404870","10411050"," The, you know, you know, I used to drink a, you want to something fun to drink?"
"10412250","10413630"," Uh, this stuff's cheap too. "
"10415070","10416450"," What is going on here?"
"10417670","10419270"," It's 103 in the afternoon."
"10419570","10420950"," We've got a triple bottom on the spy."
"10422230","10424530"," Uh, my eyes are bleeding here right now. "
"10425330","10427150"," I'm flat on the put side."
"10428230","10430690"," Not flat, I'm up, but it's not up enough."
"10432710","10434770"," Getting burned in here right now. "
"10435870","10437350"," This is making my eyes bleed."
"10437890","10439170"," I got to be honest with you."
"10440030","10442130"," Making my eyes bleed right now. "
"10442850","10446430"," The longer we spend down here, the more bullish we get for a rip too."
"10446690","10448490"," So the more time we spend down here."
"10448690","10453470"," The more bullish we're going to become. "
"10454230","10456150"," Uh, let me take a look around the market here."
"10462640","10464760"," Like we're looking for another rip right now."
"10466500","10468520"," I'm getting pissed off at this market today. "
"10469820","10475240"," This is going to be one of those days where I either lose money or I'm flat."
"10475240","10478220"," Uh, I'm going to miss the actual move."
"10478560","10480600"," This is what this market is today for me. "
"10480700","10481820"," It's like, don't trade it."
"10481960","10482580"," It's not worth it."
"10483400","10484580"," Just wait for the dip. "
"10486140","10488960"," Yeah, look at Vix's rolling over again right now."
"10490060","10491800"," Pure fucking nonsense, man."
"10493080","10496400"," I had a beautiful run on the Vix here and no price. "
"10503340","10504820"," Nice run here in the Vix."
"10505920","10510320"," And again, lower high now in the Vix, which is bad news for bears."
"10511160","10512420"," This run right here. "
"10512780","10513220"," Bullshit."
"10513820","10515300"," This is at 12 o'clock."
"10516680","10518140"," Bears couldn't get it done. "
"10518460","10521240"," If bears can't get this done, they get a lower high here."
"10521360","10522340"," We're going to squeeze higher."
"10525320","10526640"," So this is bullshit. "
"10527600","10529200"," Here we used to squeeze it already."
"10530780","10534440"," And bulls probably have a run on their coming up on their hands right now."
"10534680","10537560"," So bulls are probably going to get more than just a chance here. "
"10538780","10541240"," Uh, we might make a relief rally out of this at this point."
"10543710","10545750"," Maybe a nice relief rally here."
"10549240","10553840"," If we were not going down here, so we're likely going to get a relief rally here. "
"10563040","10564860"," Man, fucking bears, man."
"10568770","10569290"," 405."
"10571830","10573190"," 88 dog shit. "
"10578330","10579250"," Yeah, I'm not."
"10579410","10579870"," I'm not really."
"10582150","10583190"," Likely going to get it. "
"10583530","10584530"," I'll be honest with it."
"10584570","10585710"," I don't even want to trade this relief rally."
"10585710","10587290"," I had no interest in it. "
"10592920","10594680"," Best low of the day for bears."
"10595800","10596360"," 405."
"10596620","10599120"," Couldn't even tag S2 on the day yet. "
"10599900","10601220"," Couldn't tag S2."
"10601540","10602680"," Couldn't get a new low."
"10605400","10606780"," Bears needed 404. "
"10607440","10607680"," 54."
"10608780","10610020"," No dice on it right now."
"10610280","10612320"," Looks like we're ahead for a rally here. "
"10612460","10619800"," Probably to 407.70. Still inputs right now."
"10632560","10635320"," I'm probably going to take a, I'm going to take a 15 minute break."
"10635320","10636680"," It's 107 in the afternoon. "
"10636820","10641040"," The fact that fucking bears like yelling at bears now, I'm like, you fucking bears."
"10641220","10641520"," Sorry."
"10642220","10645020"," I'm like, you fucking bears couldn't get it done again. "
"10647970","10651490"," Bears are like, bears are like, we did our job."
"10651570","10652990"," We got all the way down here today."
"10653310","10654450"," I'm like, no, man. "
"10654590","10655450"," There's one more day left."
"10655690","10656970"," You need to get all this done today."
"10658430","10658990"," Bears are like, I don't know. "
"10658990","10660670"," I just really needed to take this out today."
"10663210","10666750"," So, this isn't, this definitely is not elevator down."
"10670300","10671940"," Not elevator down. "
"10672720","10674060"," Bull's court right now."
"10674260","10677740"," At one o'clock in the afternoon, Bull's having their court for the next fucking hour more than"
"10677740","10677960"," likely."
"10681070","10681610"," Yeah. "
"10684190","10685310"," Making my eyes bleed here."
"10690940","10692800"," Bull's regay and S1 right now."
"10697780","10699620"," Looking to confirm the trade higher. "
"10723090","10723450"," Yeah."
"10723590","10724650"," I think I'm going to take a lunch."
"10725050","10727530"," I'm going to leave the stream up, of course, but I think I'm going to take a lunch. "
"10727690","10728590"," I'm in puts right now."
"10729070","10733310"," I closed calls earlier and I mean, we got one more day left."
"10734190","10738830"," If this is going to be like a nose bleed all the way down into Monday, like fuck me, man. "
"10739090","10741330"," Like, this is going to suck."
"10747300","10748680"," Now, I'm going to take 15 minutes."
"10748780","10752800"," I'm going to grab a sandwich or something and leave the stream up with you guys. "
"10752800","10754640"," I'll put some CNBC on in the background."
"10755460","10757180"," I'm going to diamond hand these fucking puts."
"10757340","10758140"," I'll be honest with you. "
"10758360","10759960"," I want to see this new low down here."
"10760040","10762900"," I want to see 40454 before into the day."
"10764940","10770420"," Though the more time we spend down here, you know, the more we trade sideways down here, the more"
"10770420","10771560"," likely we get a squeeze higher. "
"10783120","10785780"," You can see all these, these flattening out right now."
"10785780","10789120"," You can already see them flattening out like this line's flattening out right here."
"10789360","10791540"," This fucking line's flattening out right here. "
"10792740","10794520"," Maybe we get that later on today."
"10798410","10798850"," Fuck."
"10802010","10803490"," Well, give me 15 minutes. "
"10803610","10804130"," We got a sandwich."
"10804470","10808290"," I'm just kind of kind of hungry right now and I'll be back with you in 15 minutes."
"10808410","10809590"," I'll put on CNBC right now. "
"10825390","10830950"," It's away from a highly anticipated meeting between house speaker Kevin McCarthy and the president"
"10830950","10831510"," of Taiwan."
"10831510","10836710"," At all places, the Ronald Reagan presidential library out in Simi Valley."
"10837410","10841970"," So to break it all down, aim in jazz versus with us in Washington, D.C. with what could be"
"10841970","10846570"," on the agenda and what it'll all mean for U.S. relations with China. "
"10847090","10847270"," Ayman."
"10847790","10848370"," Hey, Dom."
"10848530","10850650"," Well, we actually got that video just moments ago. "
"10850870","10856630"," We saw the arrival of Taiwanese president Sai Ing Wen and speaker Kevin McCarthy at that Ronald"
"10856630","10858490"," Reagan presidential library in California."
"10858950","10861130"," Take a look at the video that just fit in moments ago."
"10861130","10866450"," This is an enormously fraught session today because the Chinese government has expressed its"
"10866450","10869450"," objection to such a high level U.S. political vision. "
"10869450","10870750"," All right, I'll be back with you guys in just a few minutes."
"10871110","10873710"," We've been in a country that the Chinese see as a breakaway state."
"10873890","10877630"," This is the first high level visit of this type since 1979. "
"10878510","10881890"," Now the Taiwanese visit, though, is not an official state visit."
"10882130","10886770"," That's due to the ambiguous nature, the intentionally ambiguous nature of U.S. Taiwanese diplomatic"
"10886770","10887450"," relations."
"10887450","10893550"," So this is being described simply as a transits of the United States by Sai, not necessarily a"
"10893550","10893890"," visit. "
"10894510","10899190"," She is also expected to meet with a bipartisan group of more than a dozen lawmakers, including the"
"10899190","10902790"," top Republican and Democrat on the new House China Select Committee."
"10903330","10908450"," The Chinese government says it sees this meeting as a provocation and has threatened to retaliate"
"10908450","10911150"," for it, not clear exactly what they have in mind there."
"10911610","10916650"," Also today, members of that new China committee chaired by representative Mike Gallagher will be"
"10916650","10921530"," meeting with Bob Iger of Disney as well as top Hollywood producers, screenwriters and studio"
"10921530","10925110"," executives to discuss China and its influence over Hollywood. "
"10925430","10930070"," Tomorrow, that group will meet with Microsoft President Brad Smith, and high-ranking executives"
"10930070","10935590"," from Google parent alphabet, Palantir, and scale AI, as well as with venture capitalists, Mark"
"10935590","10937250"," Andreessen and Viola."
"10937290","10942830"," On Friday, the Select Committee members are expected to meet the intent of Apple, who himself just"
"10942830","10947130"," returned from a trip to China, where he attended meetings of the government-organized China"
"10947130","10947550"," development program."
"10947570","10953330"," This stream is sponsored by to the team in three-day-per-point, Fibonacci and market profile levels"
"10953330","10957470"," by signing up at take.com and in the business sector. "
"10957690","10959870"," Okay, let's start with the diplomatic side first, Ayman."
"10960270","10965890"," This is the first time that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has met with the Taiwanese president."
"10966490","10975730"," The Taiwanese president had met with then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in Taiwan, and that led to a"
"10975730","10983270"," very, very steep retaliation in the form of military exercises, live fire exercises from the likes"
"10983270","10983630"," of China. "
"10984210","10990850"," Are we expecting a similar type response because of this particular visit with our current House"
"10990850","10991170"," Speaker?"
"10991170","10996330"," Well, we don't know, but you did see that response to the visit with Pelosi."
"10996350","11002830"," You saw the Chinese Navy moving positions in and around Taiwan in response to that visit."
"11003170","11009990"," As we look at this video again of McCarthy and Cy at the Reagan presidential library, you can"
"11009990","11011310"," expect something from the Chinese. "
"11011470","11017010"," I would imagine the U.S. side is urging the Chinese not to, quote, overreact to this meeting, but"
"11017010","11020810"," it's clear the Chinese are extraordinarily sensitive on the issue of Taiwan."
"11021630","11024630"," They will want to respond to this in some way."
"11024730","11028710"," It's just impossible now, Don, to predict exactly what way they will decide to respond. "
"11029050","11031330"," All right, Ayman Javras with the latest on U.S.-China relations."
"11031670","11032170"," Thank you very much."
"11032650","11038810"," Coming up on the show, recent data, weaker jobs, lower input costs, showing that Fed rate hikes are"
"11038810","11044530"," doing their job, maybe surprisingly so, but with two Fed presidents now calling for further"
"11044530","11049430"," increases, despite the numbers, is a recession becoming, at this point, unavoidable. "
"11050170","11051130"," That story is coming up next."
"11051370","11055730"," Plus, natural gas prices are seeing some relief today, but they'll speak with the head of the"
"11055730","11061310"," country's largest net gas producer about that, and what it'll take to stabilize some of those net"
"11061310","11061870"," gas prices."
"11062470","11065350"," And as we head out to break, let's get a check on the markets right now. "
"11065670","11071350"," Again, approaching some of those session lows, you can see the S&P 500 down about 19 points for a"
"11071350","11073350"," down roughly 25, 26 of the lows of the session."
"11073630","11076130"," The out-dow is just about up 48 points."
"11076490","11077690"," The exchange is back at this. "
"11084800","11088480"," This is the exchange on CNBC."
"11091760","11094520"," Right now is the best time to roll into Verizon and switch."
"11094940","11097440"," I got this incredible iPhone 14 Pro on them. "

"11194570","11195730"," Right now, like right."
"11196130","11196730"," It was just outside."
"11197810","11201770"," And I've got like big black clouds swirling around literally outside. "
"11202870","11206570"," So if I do lose the stream, I might lose power here in the next half hour or so."
"11207590","11209150"," But otherwise, leave the stream up, of course."
"11210130","11211050"," I'll be right back with you guys. "

"12215890","12217090"," All right, I'm back here."
"12217510","12218210"," I want a second here."
"12218370","12221610"," I wasn't able to actually get some lunch. "
"12221950","12223750"," I had to ask for lunch to be made for me."
"12225150","12226150"," I was outside."
"12226150","12230610"," There's like tornado clouds outside and like crazy rain and winds. "
"12231750","12232750"," Hold on a second here."
"12248410","12249110"," All right."
"12255100","12257320"," Vix is sitting on its hourly right now. "
"12260900","12262320"," Vix starts to break through."
"12262460","12264500"," We could see a large squeeze here coming up."
"12264720","12266180"," Even larger squeeze, believe it or not. "
"12266360","12270340"," But currently right now, Vix is going to show you guys this real quick."
"12272300","12273740"," I'm still long put there."
"12273880","12275360"," I didn't put a stop on my should have. "
"12279250","12283890"," I'm watching Vix now sitting on its hourly trigger."
"12284090","12288490"," If we get a huge reversal here on Vix, we could see an explosive move to the upside."
"12289310","12294210"," So if Vix can't hold itself up on the hourly here, it starts to bleed off and over. "
"12295190","12298290"," Well, this could be bottom in the market for the rest for some time here."
"12298370","12300210"," Some major squeezing coming into play here."
"12301670","12303330"," We reprising of the Vix kind of stuff. "
"12303370","12304750"," It's got a pretty big move up."
"12304870","12307610"," You can see back here on the third of April."
"12308130","12309610"," We had a giant move up as well. "
"12309870","12311390"," So we'll see if this holds up here."
"12311470","12314590"," We start to reverse or if we start to blast."
"12314770","12317050"," If this starts to blast down, the market will start moving higher. "
"12317290","12321510"," But if this does hold itself up, we should get a reversal to the downside here."
"12321610","12322750"," This is the Vix we're looking at."
"12332470","12338670"," Also, Winky, if you're watching right now, I sent you the fund that I was talking to you. "
"12341510","12347970"," We'll see right now if there is any resistance here, if the market does roll over here or not."
"12348170","12350350"," This would be kind of a market moving event here."
"12350910","12351650"," If we go up. "
"12371760","12373580"," Yeah, I'm able to break out above here."
"12373680","12377060"," I might take some calls here to offset these losses in my puts right now."
"12377700","12379500"," Puts are sitting at 28 cents. "
"12380000","12380740"," It's not quite losses."
"12380980","12381820"," I'm not getting torched."
"12382660","12385640"," I'm not like bloodbathing down on the puts side of things. "
"12386540","12388200"," I'm still holding on to him right now."
"12388280","12388620"," I haven't sold."
"12388740","12389800"," Never put a stop in on him. "
"12392380","12397580"," They were up almost 100% at one point, but I was looking for a much larger print."
"12399420","12402300"," They're up like 80 cents or something at one point, not quite 100%."
"12402300","12405000"," They're probably like 60, 70, 80% somewhere in there at one point. "
"12409110","12414570"," But I just went outside in my backyard and there was like swirling clouds and like big black"
"12414570","12415050"," clouds."
"12415050","12420070"," And I went and walked my yard just to make sure I didn't have anything to go flying around."
"12420890","12426090"," If at any point I do lose power though, if the stream just cuts out or some kind of nonsense"
"12426090","12430030"," like that, we do have a tendency in these events to lose power. "
"12430750","12431750"," It's not just the infrastructure."
"12431750","12434690"," We got a ton of trees here and we have power lines."
"12434990","12435470"," They're not buried. "
"12436210","12440290"," So if any trees get ripped down around the city or anything like that, I can lose power."
"12455190","12465280"," I still have a giant gap above here at between 409.05 and 408.75. And hey, Winky, I"
"12465280","12465800"," sent you that."
"12467220","12468660"," That's the place to park money, man. "
"12472430","12473370"," Oh, you did see it."
"12473390","12474510"," All right."
"12475790","12479810"," Take a look into that and see what you think of that to see your thoughts on that. "
"12494820","12497140"," I'm watching CNBC here in the background."
"12497140","12499120"," It looks like just not garbage stock, but."
"12499120","12502500"," And with that natural gas will become a zero carbon energy solution. "
"12502800","12505600"," It is what the world has been looking for in this industry."
"12505600","12507060"," Oh, they're talking netty gas right now."
"12507100","12507560"," The cheap. "
"12507760","12512720"," The world has been searching for and it's going to be based on natural gas."
"12512920","12514380"," Toby, before we let you go, I know this."
"12514480","12515700"," I think they actually smell the air. "
"12515980","12519460"," Your footprint for natural gas production is different."
"12519760","12522940"," The air smells like smells weird too."
"12522940","12523520"," We're talking. "
"12523520","12530080"," We're talking kind of in the Appalachia region versus say some of the ones that we're talking about"
"12530080","12530820"," in Texas and Oklahoma."
"12531040","12532960"," Is there a difference in terms of the way."
"12535900","12537640"," The birds are all outside like. "
"12538280","12540520"," You can see the birds are all like let's get the fuck out of here."
"12540740","12541240"," That kind of stuff."
"12548550","12549730"," No, I'll keep holding the puts. "
"12549910","12550950"," We start trading above here."
"12551710","12552870"," We're a five minute charge."
"12552910","12555570"," So right now price is above the one minute. "
"12555570","12559570"," So I have to take the long side of this trade to see this white line right here."
"12559730","12562570"," Once we're above this white line, I have to take that trade above."
"12563170","12566930"," I also want to go back in on a straddle a little more time or a strangle of some kind. "
"12575600","12578060"," I'm going to wait for a confirmation here to see if I can get it."
"12578960","12583640"," So if we trade like this trade up, come back down here and confirm that we're going to go higher."
"12583920","12584660"," I'll take this trade. "
"12585880","12587060"," Take the long side of the trade."
"12599800","12603560"," Yeah, like, you know, it's."
"12606360","12608520"," I mean, but right now I'm looking at the Vix man. "
"12611320","12612760"," And tell you what, like."
"12614040","12616200"," It's not looking good for the bears right here."
"12619020","12620560"," Could get a face ripper out of this. "
"12620680","12620840"," So."
"12626930","12627490"," Can't cut."
"12627690","12629090"," You kind of can't fail here. "
"12630130","12632090"," And that's what's happening right now."
"12633450","12634750"," Four of sevens."
"12642930","12644490"," They're 55 cents. "
"12646750","12648630"," We got to start a position on those."
"12649550","12650370"," Just 10."
"12652930","12657690"," But you know, like, like spending this time down here, like we're spending way too much time down"
"12657690","12657850"," here. "
"12658030","12659550"," We way too much time."
"12661370","12664110"," You know, if you can't get this done over the last two days."
"12668960","12670260"," Just looking right here. "
"12671220","12673000"," If you can't get a continuation."
"12673980","12676440"," We only have one more day left to the day, right?"
"12677320","12679160"," So if you can't get continuation down."
"12680320","12682880"," And just keep going down for that one, two, three. "
"12683300","12684880"," It couldn't have taken till Monday."
"12685960","12690540"," If that's the case, then, you know, if you can't, if you can't get it done down here, they're going"
"12690540","12692320"," to rip this face up on you."
"12692840","12695660"," They're going, they're going to try at least the four, seven, sixty one. "
"12696100","12701380"," And maybe even higher, we could actually go higher here if we can break below the hourly trigger"
"12701380","12704540"," on, on the VIX."
"12704680","12706420"," And I'll show the VIX to you one more time down here."
"12707820","12709680"," You can see it better on a full screen here. "
"12710160","12712660"," If we start getting a breakdown here, right?"
"12712780","12715380"," We're just like dragging along, dragging along bullshit here."
"12716300","12718660"," And I got a shit ton of fucking puts, man."
"12718760","12720220"," I got like a hundred fucking puts here. "
"12720220","12722980"," So I need these fucking puts to print."
"12723720","12726520"," And if not, we start breaking through and down below."
"12726640","12728080"," I have to cover some of the cost of those puts. "
"12728960","12730500"," And we start doing this kind of nonsense."
"12730820","12733080"," You're talking about a pretty big move to the upside coming."
"12740880","12743940"," Some sellers stepping in right here in this volume bar right here. "
"12744000","12744700"," It's kind of good to see."
"12766800","12767940"," That's another thing too."
"12768340","12772340"," So another thing that I don't like is, would I ever have lost power?"
"12772520","12774420"," I've been in trades before, would I have lost power?"
"12775320","12776840"," And that pisses me off even more. "
"12781610","12784250"," Because then I ended up having to try close trades on an app."
"12784430","12786710"," And I can't stand trading on an app via apps."
"12796290","12798870"," See if we can get a confirmation here and see if we can cook rip higher. "
"12818100","12819260"," What do you mean zero day bullshit?"
"12819640","12821080"," Yeah, zero day bullshit is annoying."
"12822220","12823520"," But I think a lot of money in zero dates."
"12823800","12826140"," So I kind of like them a lot. "
"12831010","12832730"," But this is all bullshit here."
"12833290","12837490"," Like dudes like, so even like, I made a great trade and some puts back here, made some good money."
"12838350","12843310"," And I made some money here in this trade and then this started just canceling it all out. "
"12843370","12845410"," All this shit here burned all my put side here."
"12846990","12847790"," It's still there."
"12847930","12848590"," I mean, it's still valuable. "
"12849470","12851710"," And we lost a full value at this point."
"12852590","12857010"," There's still a, they're only down like 40% or something on them."
"12859250","12861130"," So they still, they're still kicking around there. "
"12867320","12870640"," It's kind of a thing though where I don't really get to starting when I want to close this shit"
"12870640","12870880"," now."
"12870880","12873860"," I just want to leave this both sides open back to the same fucking shit."
"12874460","12878860"," Just leave both sides open and see which side fucking prance wherever the move comes in up or"
"12878860","12879180"," lower. "
"12887430","12889130"," We want more trading day left."
"12889330","12889850"," That's all we got."
"12891330","12892630"," One more trading day. "
"12901760","12903640"," Yeah, I was looking at net gas earlier."
"12904820","12906980"," We looked at UNG and we looked at boil."
"12910000","12915260"," UNG is trading below, below six, below six, seven, seven. "
"12915280","12916520"," So that's not a buy."
"12917600","12919920"," It squeezed up there for a minute, didn't it?"
"12921520","12922620"," It squeezed up."
"12923300","12924620"," It squeezed up. "
"12924800","12926860"," So earlier it was at six, seven years something."
"12927580","12930200"," It squeezed from six, seven, eight to six, ninety six."
"12931080","12933960"," And now it's selling back down to that same area right now. "
"12938870","12939550"," It's trying."
"12946960","12950960"," It got a little bit of a pump in there, but that was it."
"12963880","12966060"," You're saying, do I save my last trade for tomorrow?"
"12966280","12968380"," Are you even saving for a moment by PDT rules?"
"12968600","12968940"," Fuck no. "
"12969100","12973380"," If you have one, if you have one trade left, you're waiting for 396 400, man."
"12973840","12974640"," You got nothing."
"12975960","12978000"," Or you take a trade like a put spread or something. "
"12979320","12981240"," Down to 400 like a week or two from now."
"12985480","12985880"," Yeah."
"12986160","12987480"," It looks like next week too. "
"12987500","12990660"," I'm looking at, we bring up that gas real quick for you."
"12998700","13001160"," The night guy, the gas favorite now is kind of here."
"13004040","13005900"," There is this nice little squeeze right here. "
"13005980","13008560"," It just took place a few minutes ago, ripped up higher here."
"13009180","13014520"," The thing about night gas is you kind of want to see these yellow bars come down and kind of"
"13014520","13015160"," level off."
"13015940","13017320"," And that's kind of showing itself. "
"13017940","13020560"," Not quite yet, but you'll see like the consolidation here."
"13021360","13025820"," And then once those yellow bars start coming up, you'll probably get a nice nice bass ripper up"
"13025820","13025960"," higher."
"13027140","13030140"," It's not quite there yet, but it's getting there, getting close. "
"13030600","13032080"," It's productive at this point."
"13035670","13037250"," But not the face of what we're looking for."
"13040460","13042060"," Sellers trying to sell it down right now. "
"13042260","13045600"," Sellers know right here that if we don't go down, sellers know right here."
"13046180","13047600"," That this thing's going to scream higher."
"13086590","13087770"," Now you got to take something in the background. "
"13092150","13093310"," Oh, baby."
"13095430","13098470"," So, hey, Winky, if you're willing to sit in right now, right?"
"13099390","13101430"," You see those two tickers that just came up?"
"13104590","13108710"," Sometimes they're worth entering and sometimes they're not worth entering."
"13109790","13114030"," So, remember OSH, when we did OSH already?"
"13114550","13115570"," Remember we did that one?"
"13116790","13118010"," And it just kept cranking, right?"
"13120210","13122330"," So that one's probably over at this point. "
"13123010","13124090"," Let's take a look at OSH right now."
"13127270","13129610"," We charted OSH once before on that same thing."
"13140580","13153090"," Do you guys remember what we went over OSH 30 minutes?"
"13157620","13158940"," Yeah, you see it right there?"
"13159760","13161340"," We charted it already, remember?"
"13163880","13165100"," Remember we charted OSH?"
"13165200","13166200"," Do you guys remember OSH Oak Street?"
"13167440","13169220"," Someone in here said, what do you think about Oak Street?"
"13170720","13173400"," And I was like, yeah, it's going to rip faces off. "
"13175780","13177440"," It ripped faces off."
"13181390","13183030"," It ripped faces off, all right?"
"13184410","13185850"," It ripped faces off."
"13186890","13188350"," It's kind of a stupid chart. "
"13189990","13199670"," It ripped faces off down here at $26 and then it went to $35.52. And now it's trading"
"13199670","13206430"," $38.83. So, just monster moves in OSH, right?"
"13206670","13209470"," At this point, so this one was ready to go."
"13212300","13213740"," So this one was ready to go prior."
"13214920","13216760"," And we charted this out together. "
"13221100","13223520"," So sometimes they're done."
"13223880","13224820"," You're like, oh, that's it."
"13224880","13225660"," I'm not doing this one. "
"13226060","13229420"," I feel like it was like, so this one I pass on right now."
"13232540","13234080"," Now this one has popped up."
"13234660","13236760"," But sometimes they pop up and they're already going. "
"13237580","13239700"," But even so, look at how beefy this is."
"13240760","13241980"," You know, it's above its weekly."
"13242640","13243280"," It's above its month. "
"13243480","13244180"," It's above its daily."
"13245100","13247040"," It's just fucking moving at this point."
"13247640","13251180"," But, you know, like one squeeze, two squeeze, three squeeze. "
"13251700","13252840"," I don't know, man."
"13257540","13260160"," Yeah, I've got OSH showing up mine right now."
"13260860","13261520"," I just ran it. "
"13263420","13264300"," I just ran it."
"13264480","13267240"," I have OSH and AGL showing up right now."
"13268540","13269540"," So I've got OSH. "
"13270620","13271820"," What's showing up on your end?"
"13272060","13273400"," Text it to me what's showing up on your end."
"13273740","13275260"," And then I've got AGL showing up."
"13278030","13279530"," This is a beautiful one right here. "
"13279650","13280350"," This one's gorgeous."
"13282110","13282730"," Agilian health."
"13286950","13288690"," So Agilian health, I like this one. "
"13288930","13291590"," Now, saying I like this one doesn't mean you're going to buy it."
"13291750","13293410"," It's kind of already its way up, right?"
"13295770","13297770"," This is kind of like a steady buyer right here, right?"
"13298030","13299430"," It keeps reaching for new highs."
"13300430","13301070"," It keeps being bought. "
"13301470","13303210"," It's strong on its daily right now."
"13303650","13304710"," And it's actually going today."
"13306010","13307770"," It's actually ripping higher right now. "
"13308050","13308730"," Just today it is."
"13311760","13312860"," It's a 30 minute."
"13316410","13319350"," Right, you can see the dips are being consistently bought right here. "
"13320490","13321570"," Right, they're buying them."
"13321750","13322350"," Boom, bottom."
"13322770","13323790"," Boom, bottom of the daily. "
"13324210","13325010"," Boom, boom."
"13325530","13326430"," And looking for higher highs."
"13329680","13331180"," So that is AGL. "
"13336120","13337120"," AGL, it's a good one."
"13338160","13339140"," Keep your eyes on AGL."
"13339580","13345600"," If you're going to look at companies like this, any biotech, medical, you want to definitely do"
"13345600","13351180"," diligence on them, and you definitely want to do, you definitely want to do what news they have. "
"13351400","13351740"," They're waiting."
"13352200","13353720"," So find out if there's any news that they're waiting."
"13354820","13359280"," You usually want to find out, you go to like stock sweats or something, and they'll be like, yeah,"
"13359520","13360720"," next month, they're getting out. "
"13360880","13362300"," They're expecting a white paper to be released."
"13363600","13364580"," Usually some kind of bullshit."
"13365600","13367480"," Never hold into any of those events. "
"13368040","13369600"," It's always sell the news and that stuff."
"13371600","13371960"," Never."
"13372320","13373480"," I mean, fucking never. "
"13373660","13375120"," I don't care if it's the best white paper ever."
"13376360","13381140"," Always sell the news on this shit, but specifically on biotech, medical companies, that kind of"
"13381140","13381320"," stuff."
"13383220","13384380"," That one's cranking, man. "
"13385080","13385440"," AGL."
"13391560","13394480"," Let me see what your, let me check this out for you right now."
"13395420","13427350"," Oh, no,"
"13427350","13427890"," no, no. "
"13428410","13429290"," I see which one it is."
"13429450","13430090"," Wakey, hold on, brother."
"13436790","13437550"," Hold on, Wakey. "
"13466600","13467960"," That's the one that you have to change."
"13473050","13477970"," It's the 200 A simple moving average, brother."
"13488520","13489900"," Do you guys remember?"
"13490680","13492060"," So let's talk about OSH. "
"13493140","13494280"," Do you guys remember?"
"13495000","13496220"," Who's in the stream right now that remembers?"
"13497940","13501460"," When we said by OSH, it was, do you guys remember what it was?"
"13502360","13503200"," It was months ago."
"13506180","13509520"," And we, someone said, don't buy OSH."
"13511440","13514440"," That was, that was back here. "
"13519580","13521260"," And it just squeezed up."
"13522980","13525140"," Just squeezed up to 38 bucks."
"13529380","13530840"," You guys remember that now?"
"13541990","13543630"," Yeah, the trade is dead now. "
"13546570","13547610"," Yeah, you remember that, Winky?"
"13548030","13548750"," Winky remembers."
"13556250","13557250"," You guys remember that?"
"13565520","13567340"," Yeah, my calls were doing pretty good here."
"13584490","13585510"," Yeah, it didn't flatline. "

"13605650","13607430"," Or why it should continue to go up."
"13607910","13609130"," Some fundamental reasons."

"13631420","13638180"," Price target above 407.58. Look for a reversal too at two places."
"13639420","13679300"," First one's at 407.24, next one's at 407.58. If"

"14111590","14114090"," The hourly trigger has now lowered itself on the day. "
"14120690","14122650"," This is where today's sellers are above here."
"14122650","14124650"," We've got a big gap to fill above too."

"14387790","14388490"," It's one minute though. "
"14389130","14390930"," As long as price holds above this one minute."
"14391070","14392670"," We're going to still keep trying to squeeze an eye here."
"14394710","14395510"," Seller rage. "
"14399810","14402790"," All the shorts in the market are right here right now."
"14402950","14404570"," They're all sitting right here."
"14406270","14408970"," Tire market shorts sitting right here right now. "
"14409010","14410010"," They're pissed off."
"14520390","14523610"," You might be asking yourself why we have this volatility here."
"14524030","14524790"," At this moment. "
"14525490","14526610"," I'm going to show you why."
"14540170","14542090"," And this is the reason right here."
"14543710","14545090"," Dip's being bought right. "
"14545770","14547130"," Dip's being bought right."
"14547670","14548650"," Dip's being bought."
"14548950","14549490"," We're going up. "
"14550370","14551370"," Dip's being bought."
"14551710","14552310"," Dip's being bought."
"14552530","14553310"," Dip's being bought. "
"14553310","14554630"," Dip's being bought."
"14554830","14555550"," Dip's being bought."
"14555690","14556410"," Dip's being bought. "
"14556590","14557210"," Dip's being bought."
"14557370","14557970"," Dip's being bought."
"14558130","14558730"," Dip's being bought. "
"14559590","14560970"," And this lasted here."
"14562170","14564230"," Going back all the way since the 28th right."
"14565210","14567150"," It started back on the 13th. "
"14569330","14571670"," And this is on the on the hourly trigger."
"14571770","14572310"," Not even the daily."
"14574030","14575230"," So the point here being. "
"14579320","14580820"," That you give me as a bull."
"14580960","14581540"," I don't want to see."
"14581760","14582600"," I don't want to trade this. "
"14583280","14586340"," But what my point here is that if price gets above."
"14586940","14588760"," You see him sitting here to sell right."
"14589620","14591620"," The shirts want to sell this down right. "
"14591760","14593440"," They get below they want to hold underneath."
"14594100","14595440"," They want to get down there."
"14596100","14598320"," They don't want the second test to get down there. "
"14598360","14600080"," They just want the first test right here."
"14600560","14602160"," This is the big short right here for."
"14602740","14604360"," Or for sell side right. "
"14604940","14607500"," So they want to see us go down and down and down."
"14610790","14612810"," They want to see the one in five minute."
"14612810","14613750"," They don't like right. "
"14613890","14616050"," If you look at this one in five minute curling over right now."
"14619150","14621630"," They don't want to see price get above the one in five."
"14622010","14625210"," And when you get the price above one in five, it's going to give time. "
"14625990","14627310"," Where this is the actual."
"14627550","14630990"," This is the actual not saying that it is right now, but this will turn into."
"14631510","14633650"," So if you've got shorts that are short here. "
"14634490","14638450"," And price is able to get above here and fight its way up and keep going higher."
"14639150","14641170"," You're going to trap all these shorts here."
"14643070","14647150"," We're not trapping the ones above over here, but you're trapping all of these shorts in here. "
"14647530","14648950"," These are all late to the party shorts."
"14650830","14654090"," And you're going to be looking to take out these shorts up here and go even higher."
"14654270","14654730"," This is for twelve. "
"14655490","14656570"," You'll be looking for four thirteen."
"14656890","14659810"," This also tells sell side that the way is up, not down."
"14660710","14662550"," So you're going to see volatility here. "
"14663310","14664210"," You're going to see."
"14666110","14668870"," A major resistance above here."
"14668870","14671870"," And volatility to to come up here. "
"14672990","14675690"," Remember we talked about once we break underneath."
"14677370","14678030"," The hourly trigger."
"14678570","14680090"," This is for the bears to defend. "
"14681750","14683130"," They have to defend this."
"14683250","14685630"," This is kind of if we flip this chart upside down."
"14685870","14690230"," If we put this chart side down and we started blasting down to the but downside. "
"14691270","14693110"," You know, you say to yourself, fools want to hold this."
"14693570","14695190"," Like on a major bottom, right?"
"14695190","14698350"," And this is kind of the same thing in the inverse for bears."
"14699170","14704370"," They don't want to see a trade above the hourly trigger because they know what happens. "
"14704990","14707290"," The market starts ripping fucking face off again."
"14800800","14802280"," Let me give you another example here."
"14804600","14808720"," So I just bought 408 C's just a moment ago. "
"14808820","14812040"," I want to make sure you guys know what I'm long in and shit like that."
"14812280","14814080"," So I'm trying to eat in the background."
"14814400","14815040"," Give me one more second here. "
"14849720","14850840"," So you're going to meet."
"14851220","14851620"," Sorry."
"14851920","14854000"," I need some water or something. "
"14854820","14858680"," So let's say, let's say NVIDIA began to roll over, right?"
"14860320","14862900"," And I made a post on Fintuit and I was like, sell."
"14863360","14863960"," It was like right here."
"14865740","14866140"," Right?"
"14866900","14869020"," I think I was like, well, let's wait until middle. "
"14869300","14871260"," I was like midnight or someone o'clock in the morning."
"14871400","14871940"," I was woken up."
"14872980","14874400"," I was talking to a clinic. "
"14874680","14875880"," I'm like, yeah, wait till morning."
"14877400","14879720"," But most people probably didn't catch this."
"14880580","14882480"," My point is that most shorts. "
"14883800","14885400"," Didn't catch this exact piece."
"14886380","14886620"," Right?"
"14886840","14888060"," Most people didn't catch to the tech."
"14890440","14892180"," A few caught this. "
"14893360","14894780"," Some jumped in here."
"14895940","14896460"," Right?"
"14896700","14899700"," But really this big push down is when a bunch more jumped."
"14900020","14901780"," And this is like the majority of right here. "
"14901900","14902620"," Meeting health speaker."
"14905100","14909020"," So if you, if you trade up higher on NVIDIA here."
"14909800","14915620"," This stream is sponsored by these shorts are now going to take the long trade and help push up. "
"14917220","14922500"," Tatching these people, putting them in and then it just starts squeezing face off."
"14923140","14927320"," These people that are short here get turned to the long side and then there you go."
"14927420","14931280"," You start squeezing like just ripping face north here. "
"14931280","14934660"," So this first group right here, this first group that's right here is short."
"14934820","14936260"," It doesn't bring last group that was short."
"14936860","14942080"," This group right here, they end up fueling this monster rally in the market. "
"14943780","14951560"," And really, truly you want to see if you're a bear, you do not want to see price get above"
"14951560","14955440"," this white line and this red line."
"14956680","14958200"," So it's, it bears alike."
"14958360","14960280"," We're going to slam this down and stop this. "
"14960440","14964200"," If they can't stop this and price stays above the white line."
"14964780","14965740"," That's when we start squeezing."
"14966000","14968460"," You'll start seeing people take the opposite side of the trade. "
"14969000","14971940"," We'll trade this all at 271.50. This is NVIDIA by the way."
"14974330","14978290"," So that's why you're seeing the aggressiveness across the market saying no, no, no."
"14978970","14980190"," Slam this down right here. "
"14980410","14982050"," Do not allow this to come up here."
"14982890","14983010"," Right?"
"14983910","14989230"," Because if the sell side already knows that if we need trade up here, that they're going to get"
"14989230","14993710"," turned into having to take the long and come up here, close the gap, all that kind of stuff."
"15013490","15018950"," It'd be fucking wild if they sold VIX down into if they sold VIX down in like 17 bucks on"
"15018950","15019170"," Thursday. "
"15019570","15023710"," That would like make my whole entire week right there."
"15025050","15037130"," I don't"
"15037130","15040310"," think that happens, but I would find it hilarious."
"15040310","15044210"," I would find it fucking crazy. "
"15047820","15052940"," If you sold VIX down to like 17 or something, you'd be burning all kinds of money."
"15064840","15070600"," If VIX trying to pull its pants up now, trade $19.39, we'll see if we can get a rejection"
"15070600","15072180"," here and start trading higher on spy."
"15074220","15079320"," If VIX trades above $19.42, we will roll over right here. "
"15079500","15080860"," So keep your eyes on VIX in the background."
"15098400","15100340"," $2.22 in the afternoon right now."
"15107180","15109680"," $401,406 out there. "
"15109920","15114060"," Unlike yesterday, today's only have $0.15 on them."
"15140400","15142060"," One more trading day left."
"15142260","15153140"," We'll go over the trading day too for tomorrow and for"
"15153140","15153680"," Tuesday. "
"15164950","15167570"," We'll review tomorrow and Tuesday."
"15192920","15194780"," This day is gone."
"15196260","15197740"," It's not a real day. "
"15198280","15207340"," I don't know why it's still on the chart is being open, but it's not."
"15216890","15218610"," Ten this day is not here right here."
"15233380","15234620"," There's a tenth right there. "
"15235000","15235140"," Okay."
"15236060","15237520"," This chart's kind of wonky."
"15237640","15239500"," It hasn't removed the day yet. "
"15240220","15241280"," Probably because of a..."
"15250580","15251580"," We're closed, right?"
"15251580","15252440"," Yeah, Friday we're closed."
"15253120","15254860"," I believe it's passed over, but it could be wrong."
"15255860","15256300"," Easter. "
"15263040","15264480"," So where do I want to buy?"
"15270410","15272330"," I want to buy down here, 396."
"15276400","15278600"," And I want to start another position over here."
"15285320","15290080"," So these green boxes down here, this is where my interest lies as like, hey, am I going to take"
"15290080","15292520"," a trade for the month of May?"
"15293900","15295560"," My interest lies down here. "
"15297600","15307660"," If we can get down here between now and Monday, I"
"15307660","15310800"," could still take some time with some consolidation and a slow grind higher."
"15310800","15315860"," It could take multiple days all of next week to get higher, but even if it's a sideways trade, I"
"15315860","15316200"," don't care."
"15316660","15318760"," Somewhere down here is where a bull wants to buy. "
"15318940","15322280"," If you're a bull out there, you want to put a bull's trade on for May?"
"15324720","15326520"," This is your preference down in here."
"15331840","15334160"," This hourly trigger that you see right here."
"15338130","15339730"," This hourly trigger right here. "
"15340730","15350350"," If we trade above it, if price goes higher and it can hold this, this is"
"15350350","15351370"," gone."
"15352470","15353750"," I don't even think about this at this point."
"15354130","15358030"," I'll put a bull's trade on with stops underneath it. "
"15358830","15364250"," This would be continuation for 15, 420, 430."
"15365170","15366790"," If any of this happens up here."
"15370310","15375050"," It's not the preferred way to do this because what happens is it turns into a melt up trade. "
"15376190","15381510"," And the shitty part of this trade here, the really, truly, truly shitty part of being a bull here"
"15381510","15388230"," is you end up doing some nonsense like you like trade up and sell down."
"15388430","15389630"," Trade up and sell down."
"15389790","15390130"," Trade up. "
"15390190","15393090"," I mean, not in this timeframe, but it'll be like up down, up down."
"15393390","15396770"," You'll just grind it all the way up for 15, 420, 430."
"15397050","15398430"," It'll just be one slow, sloggy grind. "
"15401630","15402250"," It'll suck."
"15403970","15405790"," So as a bull, you want to buy down here."
"15405910","15406810"," You want some breathing room. "
"15407830","15409470"," I'll even show this to you in a better."
"15409730","15412490"," I'll even show this to you when I'm trying to talk to you about here."
"15422530","15424590"," So you see the bones or bands here?"
"15427670","15429670"," Just look at those bones or bands here. "
"15429850","15430290"," Just look at this."
"15431310","15432990"," Do you really want to grind this?"
"15433790","15434330"," We can."
"15434530","15435530"," We've done it in the past. "
"15437110","15439110"," Many examples of us doing this nonsense."
"15443550","15444910"," But do you really want to do it?"
"15445290","15449790"," My answer to you is it's going to fucking, it's not worth, I don't know."
"15450130","15452570"," It's worth trading if you put a call spread on up here. "
"15452570","15454570"," And you just don't look at it."
"15454710","15456230"," But like day trading, dog shit."
"15458670","15462010"," What you want as a bull is to just watch the semi-green bar down there. "
"15462150","15463390"," See where that blue line is right there?"
"15463730","15465930"," Like that's the magic down there, trade down here."
"15466550","15468510"," Take it back up for another beautiful run higher."
"15469430","15470970"," That's a beautiful thing right there. "
"15471270","15471890"," Easy trading."
"15472970","15473890"," Not hard trading at all."
"15477300","15480880"," If this breaks down here, right at a stop, right?"
"15481220","15482200"," Now I know we're going lower. "
"15482400","15483600"," We're going to 380, 378."
"15484320","15485820"," Does that make sense to y'all out there?"
"15488220","15490360"," So do I want to buy this here right now?"
"15490580","15491100"," Fuck no."
"15491320","15492800"," Do I want to trade this up like this?"
"15493080","15493520"," Fuck no. "
"15493640","15494300"," I don't think a bull does."
"15494480","15495200"," I don't think a bear does."
"15495880","15497460"," Maybe a day trader will like it. "
"15498120","15500840"," If we're up here, if this pattern shows itself to be truthful."
"15502340","15503800"," We just grind up then fuck."
"15504000","15504980"," Yeah, we'll just do it this way. "
"15505060","15507240"," We'll just sell these tops and we'll buy these bottoms."
"15508060","15508680"," The whole way up."
"15510980","15511880"," They would suck. "
"15515800","15516820"," It would suck really bad."
"15518080","15520160"," It's always better to be down here buying these dips."
"15520300","15520680"," This is a bull. "
"15520820","15521500"," This is what you want."
"15522560","15524780"," And bears know that bears know."
"15525340","15528520"," Sellers know that they don't want to trade this nonsense either. "
"15529140","15530860"," You want to get down here, trade this."
"15531180","15533160"," Even better for them if they can trade this 380."
"15534840","15536320"," Sellers will take this right here. "
"15536400","15536760"," No problem."
"15536980","15537320"," They'll be happy."
"15538040","15538660"," There's your 396. "
"15539800","15543860"," There's your 400 dip below for a brief moment."
"15543860","15545540"," Then close the gap down here."
"15545540","15547320"," Get rid of all this nonsense down here. "
"15547360","15548020"," Clean it all up."
"15549460","15551840"," So just in the, just looking at this right here."
"15551900","15553920"," The next four, three sessions or whatever. "
"15559070","15560890"," Where do these fucking bones or bands?"
"15569650","15571810"," Just looking at the market as it stands."
"15574150","15580320"," For the next few days, today, tomorrow."
"15581680","15583080"," This is what you want down here. "
"15583200","15583720"," This is 400."
"15584940","15586380"," Fill the gap down below 396."
"15587100","15588560"," This seems reasonable to me. "
"15589560","15590760"," And I want to trade that."
"15590940","15593560"," I want to trade this stuff down here as a bull."
"15594820","15597420"," And bears are going to try to sell this on you down here. "
"15597900","15600380"," Bears are going to tell you, hey, we're at the top of this Bollinger Band."
"15601840","15605000"," And you know, treat, they're going to, they don't want to trade this either."
"15605140","15609440"," I don't think there's anyone out there that wants to trade this nonsense here. "
"15610280","15611340"," You know, I don't think they do."
"15611580","15612960"," I don't think they want this."
"15612960","15616620"," I don't think they want that rain. "
"15616780","15617180"," It goes up."
"15621570","15623870"," It's just a nasty range to trade."
"15632260","15634180"," It's nice to have a market that comes down. "
"15636820","15641660"," And with this, if bulls can't hold this above here and it slips back under, that's fine too."
"15642580","15644520"," But this is just, this is nasty trading."
"15649640","15654800"," So as of right now, as of right now, try to sell, if you're a boy bear, try to be"
"15654800","15655440"," selling this hourly. "
"15656080","15659640"," If we trade above the hourly bulls, you don't want to take this on, man."
"15659900","15661360"," It's your trade above this hourly trigger."
"15661980","15667940"," Right now still bearish down to 400 in 396, 397. "
"15668120","15671820"," I don't particularly like this at all right now."
"15672140","15673500"," And I don't like it coming into."
"15673820","15677280"," I crude May futures, that's like $80.61 a barrel. "
"15677800","15684480"," That's down 10 cents or 0.12%. I don't particularly like it going into what happened to the hourly"
"15684480","15685300"," trigger here."
"15686140","15687380"," Why did I lose the hourly?"
"15690320","15691460"," That's fucking shit."
"15692940","15693540"," That's like it. "
"15697180","15699080"," No, I'm ex gasoline may futures."
"15699440","15701560"," That's about $2.82 a gallon."
"15702420","15703660"," You shouldn't like it either. "
"15703780","15704240"," Maybe you do."
"15704420","15706960"," Maybe you thrive because these don't happen often when they do happen."
"15707100","15708560"," I'm ex diesel may futures. "
"15708900","15711200"," That's about $2.73 a gallon."
"15712100","15717100"," When they when we do trade, like this is a rare occurrence, not rare, but when it happens, it's"
"15717100","15717860"," just melt up."
"15717860","15719180"," And melt up sucks. "
"15719760","15722680"," I told you guys this in the past that I hate trading melt ups."
"15723140","15724620"," They can't stand them."
"15725480","15727940"," Somewhere you just put the throw some fucking puts on and you. "
"15728680","15729560"," Go long."
"15732580","15735800"," Tight train range to the right and up."
"15736540","15738680"," They buy every fucking dip down here. "
"15739600","15741460"," And just grinds higher."
"15747700","15750120"," Oftentimes, you know what, you know what a good example of this is?"
"15750780","15752160"," Oftentimes in Christmas."
"15752440","15754140"," The Santa run is like this. "
"15754480","15756100"," There's a dip during the most part of the day."
"15756120","15758340"," You buy it and then you sell at the top."
"15758500","15761080"," They do the same thing again and again and again and again and again. "
"15767550","15768750"," Oh, did I say may earlier?"
"15769010","15769710"," I meant March, April."
"15770130","15773110"," If I was saying April, may I meant March, April, I apologize."
"15774070","15774970"," May is typically weak. "
"15776070","15779270"," If I've been if I've been rattling off April, may I mean March, April?"
"15779490","15780770"," There's two strongest months of the year."
"15781930","15784030"," Two strongest months of the year March, April."
"15785050","15786370"," So I think you mentioned something. "
"15786550","15790550"," Maybe I was blabbing earlier and saying April, may April, may I mean March, April."
"15794920","15800560"," Two strongest months of the year historically by a margin, a huge margin."
"15801960","15803980"," And if you have a bad March, April. "
"15806020","15809500"," That it proves your chances even more that the next year is going to be even better."
"15815060","15819780"," But oftentimes when we have those good April's or March, April, especially the April side, it just"
"15819780","15820440"," grinds."
"15820440","15821980"," It's just like fucking straight up. "
"15822640","15825220"," It just doesn't stop until like mid May."
"15825700","15826940"," Early May and mid May."
"15827080","15827360"," It's gross. "
"15831920","15833600"," And I mix natural gas."
"15833860","15835520"," May futures says to let two dollars."
"15835680","15836480"," Yeah, it's really small. "
"15836680","15837540"," It's small ranges."
"15837920","15840520"," It's kind of almost like place that if we trade above this early."
"15842320","15846200"," It's almost like you just put a call spread on for like six weeks or eight weeks. "
"15846420","15847520"," And you don't look at it."
"15847520","15849320"," As a matter of fact, I have on right now."
"15854220","15862780"," I have on right now some pretty big IWM calls for June for that melt up scenario. "
"15863480","15865320"," I have that trade on right now."
"15866260","15868060"," Because I'm afraid it's going to happen."
"15868420","15869840"," I don't have fear of crash. "
"15870180","15873720"," I have fear of fucking melting up for like six straight weeks."
"15879320","15880140"," You should too."
"15880520","15882280"," You should be scared of that trade. "
"15887260","15888360"," That's the trade though."
"15888560","15891100"," If you're a bear, that trade will fucking destroy you."
"15891500","15893220"," It'll fucking destroy you. "
"15895660","15897280"," Let me think about it as a bull."
"15897480","15900400"," Imagine like we just grind down for six straight weeks."
"15900840","15901460"," Not go down. "
"15901720","15904300"," Just grind down every every today."
"15904460","15909700"," It's like 20 points, 10 points, 20 points, 10 points, 20 points, 10 points, 10 points, 10 points."
"15909700","15913000"," It's just down like that for like how many sessions is that?"
"15913100","15914520"," How many sessions is that?"
"15914680","15917020"," It's like fucking 30 sessions or something. "
"15921240","15923100"," Like by the dip and it keeps on dipping."
"15924960","15925820"," It'd be horrible."
"15927720","15929160"," Horrible for a bull to go through. "
"15939780","15944500"," And the VIX then during that process, the VIX just trades like the VIX would trade like."
"15944680","15947660"," The White House says 21 to 17 dollars."
"15947660","15950800"," You know, just go up and down from 21 down to 17. "
"15951240","15952340"," Tight range in the VIX."
"15953440","15954220"," It's just nasty."
"15956800","15958180"," This is nasty. "
"15963370","15965330"," VIX just stuck."
"15968530","15974530"," We couldn't even imagine being like buying VIX options and just watch them just go to zero over six"
"15974530","15974870"," weeks."
"15975430","15977330"," It'd be like be crying. "
"15982520","15992340"," Now trading 407.59. Calls are at 21.29. It puts are getting"
"15992340","15993460"," destroyed right now."
"15993520","15998280"," They're at eight cents right now."
"15999720","16001060"," Calls are making good money. "
"16001420","16005140"," So if I make a nice trade here, if I can take some money off the table above here, I'll"
"16005140","16005440"," be happy."
"16006000","16008980"," I'll take some calls above here at the early trigger."
"16009500","16011280"," I'll leave the puts on friend of day. "
"16012800","16015060"," Trading 34 cents right now on the call side."
"16017540","16020880"," There's a disgusting day, a disgusting way to make money too in the market."
"16028200","16038750"," Trading 407.70. Implyed"
"16038750","16038890"," move. "
"16039290","16041970"," We'll talk about the implied move as well from now into Tuesday."
"16042250","16043310"," I didn't get to talk about that as well."
"16050410","16052490"," Yeah, and this is the scary part too. "
"16052490","16054330"," You guys ready for this shit?"
"16054490","16055690"," I have some fucked up shit for you."
"16056490","16058510"," Options market right now for spy."
"16059950","16061070"," All the way out. "
"16062630","16065150"," All the way out to 410."
"16067730","16068850"," 410 April 10."
"16070590","16075490"," We've priced into the market 403 on the downside and 412 on the upside. "
"16077850","16081070"," 403 to the downside, 412 to the upside."
"16081790","16082530"," That's disgusting."
"16083570","16087540"," That's kind of gross. "
"16090980","16093660"," We have no range expansion in volatility."
"16094580","16096520"," Scheduled until after the 10th."
"16099060","16099460"," None. "
"16102000","16103640"," It's kind of gross."
"16112000","16114580"," Smelling like dirty nickels, doesn't it cowboy up?"
"16117020","16119480"," Options market right now, implied move."
"16120400","16122400"," Into April 10th. "
"16122980","16124040"," 412 on the high."
"16125160","16126860"," And 403 in the low."
"16127760","16137520"," And we were just at 405.88. In"
"16137520","16140700"," today's implied move for today or for tomorrow, guess what the low is?"
"16140900","16142380"," Guess what the low is implied for tomorrow. "
"16143480","16149520"," 405.19. 405.19 for tomorrow."
"16157050","16157650"," Tomorrow's low."
"16157830","16158510"," We already hit it today. "
"16158570","16159430"," We hit tomorrow's low."
"16160230","16162790"," I didn't hit it, but we got pretty fucking close to it."
"16164570","16166850"," We hit 405.88 today. "
"16167190","16168610"," We got one more day to the left of the week."
"16171950","16173990"," Upside target tomorrow, 410."
"16175910","16177110"," 410 for tomorrow. "
"16179170","16180010"," Right here."
"16181190","16182390"," Close the gap above."
"16182390","16184290"," This is our target for tomorrow. "
"16189830","16190970"," Price target tomorrow."
"16191250","16191410"," You ready?"
"16193730","16194690"," No joking."
"16196630","16197550"," Right here. "
"16199750","16200870"," Thursday price target."
"16202370","16204170"," Price target one right there."
"16208640","16210360"," This is our price target for tomorrow. "
"16211360","16212800"," And we already hit the downside basically."
"16213580","16214340"," One day left."
"16218660","16219900"," Get ready to fucking grind. "
"16235130","16235610"," Mmm."
"16237450","16238190"," No shit."
"16238410","16241930"," JPMs. I thought they normally reported on like a Monday or Tuesday."
"16246540","16248960"," How many sessions left until JPM?"
"16249840","16251000"," Reports, Winky."
"16251960","16254020"," I think it's like seven to nine is when you start looking. "
"16255000","16257880"," If they're trading down in earnings or trading up in earnings."
"16258400","16259840"," Seven to nine sessions on the banks usually."
"16276680","16278360"," JPMs do JPM, man. "
"16278560","16282320"," If JPM can take back 128 bucks and 38.38 cents."
"16311940","16313460"," Man, they may blast, huh?"
"16314860","16318220"," I like the JPM trade long calls as well."
"16318480","16318880"," They're Winky. "
"16321080","16322480"," I like that trade, man."
"16323300","16325040"," It's got some really sketchy places."
"16326580","16327600"," Do you want to see him?"
"16327600","16331640"," Oh, it also has some rocket fuel too. "
"16341830","16343790"," Here's JPM wink."
"16350580","16352420"," Careful of 128 34."
"16354540","16356260"," And 131 53. "
"16358260","16359540"," If price gets above."
"16361120","16364000"," Like 130 bucks and holds it."
"16364000","16368440"," If price on JPM get JPM gets over $130 and is able to hold it. "
"16371000","16372640"," It'll get an explosive move higher."
"16373040","16374160"," Something like this down here."
"16375920","16377020"," Explosive move higher. "
"16378480","16380340"," You'll close all this stuff up here."
"16382020","16383840"," $140 $142 something like that."
"16383960","16384840"," You'll close all this above. "
"16387840","16389279"," Just don't get trapped in here."
"16389380","16390720"," Don't get trapped at 130 bucks."
"16392500","16400230"," But you get all these triggers down here all at the same time, man. "
"16400830","16402369"," It'll rip faces off."
"16418619","16419939"," You said JPM, right?"
"16426840","16429419"," That's your dream by $108 $95."
"16431480","16437900"," And I'll tell you what, man, Winky, if it rejects on 130. "
"16441230","16442810"," I don't think it's going to, but."
"16447090","16448290"," I don't think it's going to reject."
"16448470","16449169"," I think it's going to squeeze. "
"16450369","16452490"," I also bet that they give like the sympathy."
"16453890","16460310"," If you had Jamie Diamonds trying to be the like the statesman for the country or something."
"16460970","16470290"," I think you know the whole like statesman trade. "
"16474960","16475460"," Don't worry."
"16475599","16476800"," I'll be there to save the regional banks."
"16477040","16478240"," Just put my stock up for me. "
"16495509","16496770"," Yeah, Vix is dead, man."
"16501750","16502890"," He has a clown show."
"16506610","16508970"," Today's definitely we're right back to the opening price, right?"
"16509810","16511590"," Market is right back to the opening price. "
"16512130","16514009"," I'm not quite but almost there."
"16514790","16517669"," Is the opening price right here coming straight back to it right now."
"16521599","16524340"," And I'll tell you what, man, if this is the bottom. "
"16525180","16526980"," We have no, we have no."
"16528259","16529160"," We have no."
"16529279","16531180"," The market's not pricing in any vault tomorrow. "
"16532040","16533160"," Nor on the 10th."
"16544830","16546849"," Implied move is just dead."
"16562830","16564790"," And this is your PT above for tomorrow. "
"16565050","16566230"," Tomorrow's closed for 10."
"16580130","16582950"," Yeah, no, I've all my charts and we will fuck you guys."
"16583090","16585050"," You don't see all the charts through like this one right here. "
"16585050","16585590"," That's a chart."
"16587910","16589650"," This is a trading view chart right here."
"16589750","16590330"," That's trade and view. "
"16591410","16592650"," You want to see think or swim?"
"16593849","16595189"," That's that's this one right here."
"16595310","16595910"," That's think or swim."
"16597349","16598730"," That one over there is trading view. "
"16598990","16599550"," That one's we will."
"16602090","16603470"," You want a different chart?"
"16604810","16606050"," I'm just fucking with you."
"16610439","16611320"," Which chart do you want?"
"16611380","16611500"," I'm serious. "
"16612520","16613720"," Which brokers you want to chart from?"
"16616860","16626700"," The only"
"16626700","16630160"," reason why I leave a chart up for we will for you guys like as a base chart is because"
"16630160","16633200"," a lot of new traders trade or they try to get them up."
"16634680","16635040"," Robinhood."
"16635860","16637619"," Usually they migrate over to weevil. "
"16640360","16642700"," And those charts are free and fast."
"16642960","16643599"," There's fast as."
"16646279","16649360"," Anything you pay for anything that I've paid for. "
"16650080","16653180"," Other minute charts are as best data you can get."
"16654259","16655520"," So we're just looking for ticks."
"16656400","16657919"," It's not it works very well. "
"16666560","16667720"," Yeah, I like doing that."
"16668040","16668759"," I love owning stock."
"16668759","16673840"," And for me right now, I'm not ready to buy stock and then I sell it for profit. "
"16673860","16675680"," I don't feel like hedging shit right now."
"16676180","16678580"," So if I find a low, I will buy a hundred shares or something."
"16678860","16681660"," Sell puts and calls against it in a bull market, I will. "
"16682520","16684220"," We have a stabilized market right now."
"16686460","16689160"," So you're asking me, like, would I buy?"
"16689720","16691099"," So if I'm looking at SPX."
"16696599","16698279"," If I'm looking at SPX, right?"
"16698660","16700460"," So the currently for the market for me. "
"16702160","16705759"," I have bought some stock, but I've sold it."
"16708180","16709500"," This is SPX right here."
"16709599","16710540"," Every time I come down, right?"
"16710619","16711900"," This is back in June, right?"
"16713040","16714939"," Every time I come down here, I'll buy some stock. "
"16715939","16717200"," I buy stock here."
"16718099","16719220"," Do I buy stock right here?"
"16719400","16719800"," Fuck no."
"16722259","16724480"," We're in the midst of a trough of a sideways trading. "
"16725480","16727640"," So I know I'm going to have better opportunities to buy."
"16728820","16729680"," Another one to buy right there."
"16731800","16733580"," Hopefully we come back down here at some point. "
"16740080","16742680"," The market's trading in this trough right here."
"16742980","16747460"," And there's likely going to be a capitulation moment to a big capitulation moment to the downside."
"16748439","16752640"," So I can buy stock down there, but do I stop by stock up here, up here, up here?"
"16752900","16754040"," No, I don't personally. "
"16774470","16776690"," There are some stocks you can, though."
"16778170","16783650"," They run a program with Winky in the background and that stuff I'll buy."
"16784910","16789130"," Sometimes I'm like, yes, two days ago, I bought AMC, held it over fucking night, though. "
"16789190","16789870"," That was it, right?"
"16791550","16796750"," See, I'm only holding stuff for a move, not like hand buying and holding for a long period of time."
"16797090","16800510"," If you're going to buy something for a long period of time, like I'm going to go buy some AMC"
"16800510","16803270"," or excuse me, AMD."
"16804230","16808170"," I feel like I want to buy AMD and hold it for a year, two years, three years. "
"16809290","16813570"," There's likely going to be a lower low than that at some point this year, where you could get a"
"16813570","16814510"," really good price on it."
"16814590","16818630"," You could sell a shit ton of puts against it, and then on a high, you could sell a bunch"
"16818630","16819350"," of calls on it."
"16824580","16828160"," Yeah, it's at home. "
"16829760","16830820"," Okay, let's look at AMD."
"16838250","16839330"," Yeah, I got you, man."
"16840530","16841750"," So here's AMD. "
"16842190","16847870"," If you want to invest in this market, we talk about this sometimes on the show, right?"
"16847870","16856590"," If you're like, hey, I like trading this stock, or let's say you're like, I like owning AMD, or I"
"16856590","16857510"," want to own AMD."
"16865290","16876970"," You always have to consider market conditions whenever you're"
"16876970","16877830"," buying stock, right?"
"16878490","16879810"," AMD is a good company to buy."
"16880030","16881570"," I don't think AMD is going bankrupt or anything. "
"16881770","16882070"," I like it."
"16882430","16884190"," I like it like I like S&P 500."
"16886430","16889290"," But you've had some chances down here to buy it already, right?"
"16891250","16898170"," One chance had two chances had three chances had another chance kind of a kind of a chance right"
"16898170","16898430"," there. "
"16899350","16904610"," So you've got one, two, three, four chances so far to buy AMD in a low."
"16906830","16910570"," So what I would do is you can take one of these lines here."
"16910610","16912750"," You see some gaps being left down here, too. "
"16912910","16913850"," These gaps being left behind."
"16914730","16919950"," So the first thing I would do is start sending alerts on your own software at home."
"16920310","16928190"," You can click right click usually and create an alert, send you an email or an email message, send"
"16928190","16928990"," you a text message. "
"16930290","16934090"," And make sure that the best way to wake you up, sometimes it's four o'clock in the morning."
"16934310","16940750"," Sometimes it's eight o'clock at night and usually I'll set these things a little bit higher than I"
"16940750","16941330"," want to buy at."
"16941330","16943630"," Just slightly higher so I can get interested in buying. "
"16944350","16948990"," So let's say I'm bullish here on AMD going higher, right?"
"16949230","16952610"," When it starts to roll over though and it comes down here and you can actually buy it at a"
"16952610","16952990"," good price."
"16953910","16957410"," And it's ready to do that for 50 stocks or 100 stocks that you like."
"16958170","16961390"," You'll always have a chance to buy the one that you want. "
"16962170","16966290"," Then you're not committed to just that stock."
"16966470","16968530"," So you just start making these lists for yourself."
"16969470","16971850"," And this is the first basis here, right?"
"16972070","16972550"," Let's go on. "
"16972670","16973730"," Let's move this forward."
"16974270","16975430"," Let's get some other stuff for AMD."
"16977850","16982590"," I'd set another line below here to this retest down below. "
"16983150","16984730"," You know we work with range bound."
"16985050","16988330"," Then we trade outside of our range and unexpected move."
"16989670","16995950"," So if you have this thing where AMD is trading like this and then one time it trades high, that's"
"16995950","16996970"," where you take some profit, right?"
"16997950","17001810"," And it starts trading like this and then it trades right out of range one time and you're like,"
"17001990","17005390"," Hey, I have a chance to add to my position so I can now sell some puts on it. "
"17005510","17005870"," Make sense?"
"17007550","17014090"," And then if you already know, you should know and I should know that there's a high likelihood in"
"17014090","17015690"," the next few years, it could be this year."
"17016790","17020990"," There's a ton of people long bonds that are saying that they want the market to sell off one more"
"17020990","17021170"," time."
"17021310","17021970"," They want it though. "
"17021970","17023030"," They want, they're like, I want to bottom."
"17023290","17023990"," You got gun lock."
"17024030","17025130"," You got all these people out there. "
"17025130","17025670"," You got JPM."
"17027370","17027770"," Right."
"17027810","17028930"," So you start looking back here. "
"17029010","17033910"," This is a 2020 down here and you add one more down here just in case."
"17035110","17036830"," Take the entire trade away."
"17036870","17038390"," Well, actually, that's a little right right there. "
"17041090","17041490"," Right."
"17041830","17043730"," So you're an AMD bull."
"17047150","17047550"," Right. "
"17047750","17051490"," And you see these prices down here, $49, $60, $72."
"17052830","17057470"," And what you're going to do is you let's say you have a hundred fucking dollars."
"17057970","17061130"," I guess you have to have a thousand or something, but let's pretend it's a hundred. "
"17062070","17062730"," And it works."
"17062830","17064010"," Let's say it's a thousand dollars."
"17064070","17065830"," I don't know, but we're talking percentages here. "
"17066550","17069530"," When you're down here, you're going to probably buy what?"
"17069890","17072070"," 25% right of whatever money you have."
"17072950","17077650"," You'll say, Oh, yeah, I'm an add another 35% of my let's say I've got 10 grand, right?"
"17077650","17081490"," I'm going to spend $2,500 here on AMD next time it's down here."
"17082010","17088930"," I'm going to spend $3,500 down here in AMD, and then I'm going to spend another, I don't know,"
"17089670","17093170"," a thousand bucks or something down here, $2,000 down here. "
"17094170","17096610"," Let's say you have like 500 bucks left over."
"17099010","17102010"," And you're able to see your first buy in 72 bucks."
"17102310","17103210"," Your next one's at 60. "
"17103850","17105010"," Now you're in for what?"
"17105250","17107030"," 65 or something?"
"17107370","17107650"," 64?"
"17109270","17109710"," Right."
"17109850","17110930"," Then you add some more down here."
"17111110","17113230"," And now your DCA is in at 55 bucks. "
"17114470","17114890"," Right."
"17115090","17116850"," You're now like your DCA is down here."
"17118470","17122050"," Anything below here, it's likely going to bounce back up to where you DC aid. "
"17124190","17124630"," Right."
"17124690","17129490"," If there's like some huge pitch relation move in AMD, it's likely going to bounce faster than you"
"17129490","17129810"," can blink."
"17131010","17133570"," And this does serve two purposes. "
"17134970","17139470"," You're not being left behind if this is the actual bottom of the market."
"17140310","17142650"," Because you're at least able to buy some shit at 72 bucks."
"17143430","17143430"," Right. "
"17143990","17148750"," If there's a pitch relation move down, you save some gunpowder to DCA."
"17149670","17154230"," And then you have the last thing to tell yourself is, where do I feel comfortable owning AMD?"
"17155610","17159610"," So if you're like, Hey, if I DCA and you do your own math, the money that you want to"
"17159610","17161490"," spend and be like, okay."
"17161490","17163430"," So now I own the AMD at 65 bucks. "
"17164330","17166990"," Do I feel comfortable owning AMD at that price?"
"17167350","17170770"," Even if it goes lower, you have to ask yourself that it goes down to 40."
"17170930","17172530"," Let's say you're DCA and you're growing it now 50."
"17173150","17175030"," And it goes to 35 for a year or two. "
"17175110","17177350"," Can you can you own that for that that year?"
"17178810","17180790"," It's like buying up here at 103."
"17181770","17182910"," I wouldn't own it at 103."
"17184790","17187670"," I would own it down here like 50, 60 bucks. "
"17189550","17191490"," Makes it really easy to sell."
"17191750","17194210"," Like up here, it makes a real let's say you own let's see what it's $54."
"17196330","17196770"," Right. "
"17197110","17199250"," It made it really easy to sell puts down here, didn't it?"
"17199870","17201410"," And up here at 50 bucks."
"17202190","17204090"," Not so bad selling out the money call here, is it?"
"17204910","17205550"," Makes sense?"
"17205550","17209730"," So your buying lows, selling calls up here, selling puts down here."
"17212560","17217780"," So yeah, AMD fucking now the one thing you're going to hear too here is you're going to see bears"
"17217780","17218200"," out there. "
"17218200","17220180"," They're going to tell you, Don't worry, bro."
"17220340","17221360"," Don't DCA."
"17221500","17222800"," We're going down here to 50 bucks. "
"17223600","17228240"," I can't tell you how many fucking times I've heard that shit and we never came back."
"17228240","17229980"," We just blast it off and you lost out."
"17229980","17232840"," So you'll likely see this again. "
"17233720","17237380"," You'll likely see 72 bucks, 73 bucks somewhere in there."
"17239340","17241780"," Could be 4 a.m. Could be 9 o'clock in the morning."
"17242880","17244260"," Usually it's a weird time of the day or night. "
"17245080","17246780"," Could be a market issue that happens."
"17247140","17248700"," Could be bonds take off."
"17251380","17255360"," All kinds of outside influences that don't have to do with the price of AMD. "
"17262080","17264180"," And I would say do that for a bunch of companies that you like."
"17264180","17267200"," If you find like ETFs, companies, ETMs, whatever it is."
"17270240","17273500"," And you set alerts up on like 25, 50, 100 of those companies. "
"17274400","17275680"," They'll come your way eventually."
"17290090","17290890"," Hey, welcome."
"17293390","17294330"," No worries, man. "
"17298330","17299790"," I bought Tesla that way."
"17299990","17301890"," My last large purchase was Tesla."
"17303090","17306250"," And I was like, I was like, I don't mind owning it 100. "
"17306830","17309290"," I don't mind DCAing at 65."
"17310610","17312850"," Worst case scenario at 40 bucks or so."
"17313170","17314530"," And I'll fucking add more there. "
"17315210","17318570"," And for myself personally, I was like, what's the worst that can happen here?"
"17318790","17321490"," The worst that can happen is that I own a bunch of Tesla at 50 bucks."
"17321570","17322390"," And I've got two daughters."
"17323270","17326350"," So I'm like, okay, let's see the market shifts the bed for three to five years. "
"17327470","17329750"," I can probably hand those off to my kids one day."
"17330250","17332150"," And be like, here, I own Tesla stock for you."
"17332230","17333090"," I got it for 40 bucks. "
"17333590","17333950"," It's yours."
"17334250","17334630"," You keep it."
"17335490","17336290"," You got married. "
"17336630","17337190"," I don't know."
"17337190","17338470"," You fucking graduated college."
"17338470","17339330"," You need to buy a house. "
"17340750","17342130"," Or I retire one day."
"17342230","17342510"," I'm old."
"17343630","17346890"," And I say, thankfully, I have the chance to buy Tesla way back then. "
"17347210","17351330"," And if the AMD is that company for you, you have to find out in your own mind."
"17352230","17357550"," And this is not financial advice, but this is what I do when I try to buy to own a"
"17357550","17357790"," stock."
"17365000","17365400"," Nice. "
"17365760","17366540"," Nice recyclable."
"17367980","17373520"," If you really want to, if you really want to build an account, if you're young, right, I'm going to"
"17373520","17373920"," tell you something."
"17374180","17379460"," One day, what you aspire to do is own the S&P 500 and sell calls and puts. "
"17380320","17384680"," It's the, it's the rich man's way of making a lot of fucking money in this market."
"17387490","17391930"," Mostly because the S&P 500 tends to be sideways and up slowly over time."
"17392730","17396290"," It tends not to correct historically, it tends to go sideways and up. "
"17406400","17407300"," Thanks for the heads up, BCE."
"17407620","17412140"," BCE saying, weird underlying moves today, shop selling off persistently, veil rotation, lower"

"17416200","17421120"," Joe Donut checked in this morning and said, he was like, you know what this looks like?"
"17421200","17422040"," And I'm like, yes, sir. "
"17424360","17425980"," He's like, it looks like a rotation trade."
"17426160","17427100"," I'm like, it does, doesn't it?"
"17434240","17435820"," It doesn't look like sell the market."
"17436080","17436700"," Looks like rotation. "
"17438160","17440180"," Looks like big money moves across the market here."
"17452180","17457960"," It looks, it looks like it's walking and talking like a rotation, not like a liquidation."
"17458100","17459460"," I said, yeah, it does, doesn't it?"
"17470390","17471510"," Walk it in talking. "
"17529920","17531140"," Retire, you can't."

"17550900","17553380"," I don't think this is going to, I think again, this is your straight dump."
"17554700","17557380"," Did you guys see that rotation chart that I showed you the other day?"
"17570040","17572300"," I had this up on Twitter the other day. "

"17614080","17619840"," Now, this has changed somewhat, but it was before it was energy, right?"
"17620520","17623460"," Up until the 30th, energy was at the bottom."
"17624280","17627500"," Until we came into the first of the month, energy was actually down here."
"17628800","17632780"," Real estate was down here, financials was down here and healthcare was down here. "

"18328970","18330950"," And then they moved to four or eight or something."
"18331390","18331930"," That's what it was."
"18332090","18333490"," I think they were at four ten. "

"18363230","18367330"," I looked over and I saw I saw 400,000 puts."
"18367650","18368830"," Then 300,000 puts. "
"18369110","18370310"," Then 200,000 puts."
"18370510","18371990"," Then 125,000 puts."
"18372870","18374630"," I'm like a bit to that 125,000. "
"18374730","18377250"," We're already there and other people spreads or some shit."
"18377250","18380170"," The other three or 400,000 were definitely dealers."
"18381530","18383050"," Fucking gamma baby. "
"18383750","18386630"," I was like here we go."
"18388010","18391050"," And it was straight green bars right into the fucking clothes."
"18391450","18394470"," Anyone that was it was like I'm like puts or shorts. "
"18396210","18397290"," Got fucking."
"18398510","18400150"," I don't want to say the word but."
"18401270","18406150"," I was flat at that time so I didn't care. "
"18406150","18408510"," But if I was if I was input."
"18408770","18413270"," So if I was inputs that close yesterday, I probably would have went outside and shot the tree down"
"18413270","18413710"," or something."
"18414270","18421920"," And we had talked about it earlier yesterday. "
"18422400","18424440"," Like we knew these weren't spreads or anything."
"18424780","18426600"," We knew they weren't flies or anything like that."
"18426960","18428080"," They weren't in the market. "
"18428240","18430700"," They came into the market and moved around all day yesterday."
"18436760","18438700"," So just I'll let you know this."
"18438800","18438980"," Okay. "
"18439700","18442720"," I'm going to let you know the options market."
"18442720","18446080"," The implied move for tomorrow."
"18447100","18448580"," Is four zero eight. "
"18448940","18449990"," I think thirteen."
"18451320","18455020"," I mean no sorry four zero five thirteen."
"18456620","18459440"," And then on the upside it's four ten. "
"18460040","18461020"," And some change."
"18464110","18467980"," So maybe four tens and four oh fives."
"18473620","18476580"," We already tagged today down here. "
"18478500","18479980"," Four oh five eighty eight."
"18481820","18485060"," So you know if we're tagging kind of the low down here."
"18487520","18489940"," Kind of already tagged the implied move. "
"18492140","18494140"," Have not tagged for ten though."
"18495980","18497620"," Have not tagged for ten."
"18497760","18499640"," As a matter of fact where's the scene of the crime. "
"18507260","18508440"," What I just do here."
"18524670","18527290"," It's kind of the implied moves kind of already been tagged."
"18528910","18532170"," I wouldn't expect much more than this four oh five down here. "
"18532170","18532970"," Like right down here."
"18533150","18534650"," I'm not going to expect more than that."
"18536690","18540190"," The dealers are saying the lowest we're going is right here. "
"18541210","18543010"," Kind of got close to it didn't we."
"18545030","18546630"," I don't want to say to you."
"18547530","18550010"," The other side of this move is up here. "
"18553920","18556400"," So this is like the this is the implied move here."
"18556600","18557940"," And this is the implied move here."
"18559000","18562620"," So you have to kind of decide for yourself was it was it kind of like yeah. "
"18562880","18563600"," Here's the lower end."
