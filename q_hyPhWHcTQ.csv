"67660","68480"," Hey, Cap and Ron."
"69220","71460"," So on Wednesday, I was having internet issues."
"72300","77880"," The Comcast guys came and wanted to turn the internet off in the middle of the broadcast. "
"78220","79000"," I was like, you have to come back."
"79900","81180"," So they came back on Thursday."
"82260","83980"," Let me make sure everybody say hi to everybody. "

"100340","100900"," Good to see you."
"103460","104660"," Shit at all your plays. "

"109340","109940"," Good to see you."
"110720","115000"," Carrie, Charlie, Binky, Faison, Cedar, Ken, Ergo."
"115280","115860"," Good to see you all. "
"117860","123660"," Yesterday, they didn't come back yesterday to run a new line to my house and it within my house"
"123660","124200"," too."
"124500","125660"," So I was getting dropped signal."
"126520","129740"," This morning, I didn't come on because I was on the phone with Joe Donut. "
"130520","134400"," And so I was going to get on before market open, but we got into a long conversation."
"137240","138120"," Eddie, I apologize."
"138520","142160"," I'll try to I'll try to get you on band from Discord. "
"144100","145420"," I'll try to figure out what happened."
"148220","149240"," Adam, good to see you."
"149440","149640"," Ergo. "
"150800","151640"," Jasmine, blood stunt."
"152800","153340"," All right."
"153740","154900"," So we're going to talk about something real quick. "
"156900","157260"," Good."
"157480","158420"," I missed you all as well."
"158640","159360"," Terry missed you. "
"160100","161940"," So everything is everything is just fine."
"164120","168640"," So yesterday, the internet was down in my house for half the day."
"169200","173400"," I also have some honey do things I had to do. "
"174040","179780"," And so with the internet down, and I have some I have some properties here that I have to take"
"179780","180320"," care of."
"181000","182000"," Yadda yadda yadda."
"182300","185200"," So I wound up just finishing that stuff up yesterday. "
"186280","194740"," I also took some time to unpack a lot of what was said by the by the Fed"
"194740","201740"," yesterday or last night, which needs to be an entire video."
"202740","204520"," We have a ton."
"205120","206260"," Yeah, good to see you Eddie. "
"206800","208940"," There's a ton of stuff for us to go through."
"211280","212980"," And it's going to take some time."
"213080","215660"," It's going to take through the weekend. "
"218340","222340"," Market implications to the Fed."
"223320","227900"," You know, that this should be you know, and I didn't replace the link."
"227900","229820"," I need to replace I need to get a new link. "
"230880","234100"," I'll try to do that at some as a matter of fact, I'll do it right now."
"243370","246770"," I'll try to mention I'm going to post one right now."
"247450","248350"," There should be a new link. "
"251730","257750"," I think the discord link in this feed is has expired."
"258890","261130"," So I'll get a discord link for you right now."
"262490","264130"," I'll post it in the chat. "
"267170","268850"," If I always forget how to do this."
"269990","271370"," Like invite friends."
"271450","271790"," There we go. "
"273450","275910"," I will put one in the chat right now."
"279390","286310"," So there's lots of impact still from the Fed meeting."
"286590","287510"," I don't know what you got. "
"287630","289490"," I haven't been on just adds up to."
"289790","291430"," So I have not been on the internet."
"292290","293570"," I haven't been. "
"294530","296330"," So I just posted a link to the discord."
"296890","298290"," I haven't been on social media."
"298610","299630"," My internet was down. "
"306620","307260"," All right."
"307440","308680"," So I haven't been on the internet."
"309080","310400"," I haven't been on social media. "
"310400","314080"," I don't know the entire take on the Fed."
"316980","323660"," I've seen some articles and read some articles from CNBC and around the net."
"324100","329760"," But I can see I think that there's two different schools of thought. "
"332120","333960"," I got to turn this off again."
"339690","344870"," I can see that there's two different schools of thought on what's going on."
"345870","347590"," And there is some divisiveness. "
"348250","354550"," And there's divisiveness from all corners of the internet right now."
"359400","361300"," And what we need to talk about it."
"361420","370420"," Because I remember when we had that snapback trade earlier in the week, people expected to ban a"
"370420","370660"," trade. "
"371400","374740"," And then we expected to ban a trade after the Fed meeting."
"374740","375420"," We didn't get it."
"378000","383980"," And that's the second time we were talking about our markets. "
"384280","389800"," And we've been talking about, as someone said, there were lots of put saw."
"389900","392620"," I think Spock and my last week said there were lots of putsellers."
"392880","393760"," That wasn't the case. "
"393760","394960"," There weren't putsellers."
"395900","401720"," And we've been talking, this conversation's been going on with us since we were back at 479."
"402900","403340"," 80. "
"403620","406680"," We started to talk about a put back edge."
"407400","408440"," Talked about it on Twitter."
"409800","412900"," Talked about wanting to put these hedges on. "
"413540","415140"," The importance to hedge the market."
"416460","418180"," We talked about it when we came back up."
"418320","424200"," We had that huge then a trade that was back here on January 12th, right?"
"425040","426260"," And to hedge the market there. "
"428860","437480"," And that all coupled with the actually the interview, the question and answer from the"
"437480","439440"," reporters."
"439980","443640"," There's a couple of reporters that asked Astrum very good questions."
"444320","447160"," Some of the questions weren't so good, but there were some very good ones in there too. "
"449400","452740"," And we have to talk about this at some point this weekend."
"453220","455720"," It's going to be, I have a bunch of information to show you guys."
"457020","465920"," So I was going to do a video on Sunday about gamma levels and dealers hedging and all this other"
"465920","466180"," shit. "
"466700","468380"," But it's not really important right now."
"468480","470880"," There's a more important discussion that has to be had."
"471900","477200"," Because I also noticed a lot of bulls, big bulls in the marketplace. "
"478280","483820"," There's this one argument where hey, we should be buying quality software companies that aren't"
"483820","484720"," going to deal with shortages."
"486920","494400"," So you can invest or reinvest by Netflix, by Microsoft, stay away from companies that haven't done"
"494400","495520"," anything weird, you know that right?"
"495780","501140"," Stay away from companies that could have shortages from material goods."
"503460","505740"," And there's this other argument out there too. "
"506060","509800"," Hey, you have to look real carefully at what companies were buying this year."
"510400","519240"," So this was even part of my theory was, you know, we have to make sure that they're producing a"
"519240","522720"," product, that they're profitable, that they don't need loans."
"524480","528880"," But there's actually a bad trade in there too with that statement that I made. "
"529680","537140"," And that has to do with goods and services and the fact that people have already bought all their"
"537140","537340"," goods."
"538400","540080"," So that trade's not even in there."
"540280","546680"," So even if you have a, it has to do with sort of just too with some other issues with"
"546680","547500"," our economy. "
"549360","558520"," And which implies that you can't actually make a trade right now into companies with great earnings"
"558520","567720"," with good guidance that produce physical goods that a profit could be made off of."
"570120","576200"," So everybody's bought their mattresses, everybody's bought their cars, everybody's bought"
"576200","579480"," everything that they could consume the last two years."
"579740","580400"," They've bought their homes. "
"580820","583800"," I know you're going to say, well, the real estate market is great right now."
"584680","591760"," But in reality, most people have bought the shit that they want to buy, the pelotons that they want"
"591760","592020"," to buy."
"593140","601520"," And pelotons actually a better bell weather for that trade not being good as we move forward this"
"601520","608020"," year in the markets, which is of concern because it actually shows that there is no place to hide"
"608020","609780"," for the next year. "
"612220","613480"," There is no place to hide."
"613620","621860"," There's no, there's no company this year for me that is a good investment for this year in the"
"621860","622340"," goods category."
"629040","639020"," There's also a thought that there's a good trade in, in some of the services that will"
"639020","646480"," come back online that there'll be this period of reopening in the United States where you could"
"646480","654000"," pick up right now or a place the target would be, let's say, Disney stock or Las Vegas Sands stock"
"654000","662360"," or maybe live, right, for concerts or mountain for real resorts. "
"664260","668560"," Dave and Buster's restaurant stocks, right?"
"668760","670380"," And there's been a bid in restaurant stocks."
"670960","678980"," These are services that have been closed for the last two years and have been really beaten down,"
"679140","679220"," right?"
"679360","685100"," You look at the trade, you look at the trades like all the gambling stuff, right?"
"685240","686480"," All the resort stuff."
"687560","691280"," Some of the restaurant stocks have been catching a bid recently the past couple of weeks. "
"692800","702760"," But there are now numbers coming out saying that behind the scenes people are not actually going to"
"702760","703260"," those places."
"704140","706760"," And I didn't go to my trip this year."
"706900","708700"," I didn't take my winter trip this year. "
"709100","710080"," So that piqued my interest."
"710640","713720"," That doesn't mean that Park City wasn't slamming or Vale wasn't slamming."
"714200","716640"," They were, they were busy this year. "
"717580","718820"," The price was out of control."
"719980","723380"," They would have caught, I could have bought a small house somewhere for what would cost me to go"
"723380","723700"," this year."
"725700","728920"," But there's other, there's some mechanical underlying issues in our economy. "
"730240","732320"," There's issues with our inflation."
"734220","735760"," There are issues with tightening."
"736940","742500"," There are issues with, you know, I need your whole program about this, but you basically you've got"
"742500","743140"," the Fed, right?"
"743960","752260"," And they provide liquidity to banks and then banks in turn provide liquidity to a business, right?"
"752420","755280"," Let's say, it doesn't matter what the speed or it does matter. "
"755540","759200"," But let's say you're providing liquidity to a business that's trying to create a new product."
"761120","762720"," Well, that shits out the window, right?"
"763260","769520"," Like something that that hasn't been proven yet free money for develop a company that's trying to"
"769520","770780"," develop some kind of something that's new."
"771660","774800"," Then you also have liquidity that's going to cost a lot of money for a company that does produce"
"774800","782380"," goods or even even services right down to the to Billy Bob who's got a landscape and company so"
"782380","783640"," that they can expand, right?"
"784920","787660"," And that that those loans aren't free or cheap anymore. "
"788140","791620"," And they got to put the microscope over these people and make sure they can pay back to those"
"791620","791880"," loans."
"791980","794120"," And even then there's a high price for those loans."
"795800","802740"," And then you've got people back to work, but there is a silent group of people that are not back"
"802740","803420"," to work out there. "
"804560","810100"," And even if they do go back to work, the cost of goods for them, like so you've got Billy"
"810100","810680"," Bob, right?"
"810800","812120"," He owns the landscape and company."
"814480","815780"," And he can't get money."
"816520","821480"," Now he's already that Billy Bob has been buying like brand new trucks for $140,000 and buying a"
"821480","825320"," brand self brand new pool house with a pool with a huge mortgage. "
"826920","832160"," He's bought a bunch of, you know, he bought a new mattress, new washing machine, new dryer, bunch"
"832160","832860"," of stuff on credit."
"834680","837080"," And you've got missing people in the workforce."
"837260","838520"," They're not going to work for him. "
"839080","843260"," You've got people that are paying now too much money for gasoline, which will kill an economy,"
"843720","843860"," right?"
"844360","848300"," You've got people that are paying too much for restaurants, go into restaurants, too much for"
"848300","850080"," skiing, too much for all this other stuff."
"850660","852180"," And they don't spend their money."
"852500","856280"," Now they say they've been spending their money, but they actually haven't because they've been"
"856280","862580"," spending it on higher prices for food, higher prices for mortgages, higher prices for all the shit"
"862580","863760"," that they bought the last two years. "
"864700","872440"," And so when they can't pay Billy Bob for their extra lawn care that month, or they can't go to"
"872440","873600"," a veil to go skiing."
"876360","881140"," And so these companies are going to experience less money coming in the front door, right?"
"881440","882620"," And they can't pay their loans."
"882820","883500"," They're now more expensive. "
"885360","890800"," And I'm going to do a more or more detailed videos so that I'm not jumping around here and some"
"890800","893340"," more direct in this and trying to get this across to you guys."
"893820","898240"," But the point being, and then you've got the free money going away, right?"
"898560","901520"," There's no checks coming in anymore to households."
"902960","909920"," There's no checks coming in anymore to businesses with grants and loans, PPP or PPP or whatever"
"909920","910320"," it's called. "
"911860","914420"," You just don't have that money, that free flow of money anymore."
"916140","921580"," So that all coupled together with higher prices, you're not seeing prices come down with homes,"
"921880","925700"," you're not seeing prices come down with gas, you're not seeing food prices coming down."
"926200","931660"," You were told the other day that we're going to have shortages, which is going to increase the"
"931660","932880"," prices of all these goods. "
"936040","938320"," And what it does is it slows our economy down."
"939500","944060"," And the federal bank in turn doesn't want inflation to rise."
"944400","946140"," So they're going to try to squash it as well, right?"
"946280","947660"," Inflation at the same time. "
"948040","951420"," Well, what this implicates is that we're going to have a slowdown in our economy."
"953040","958240"," And the Fed in my view point is going to raise rates in March."
"959380","965240"," And I don't think it's going to matter if they don't raise rates if we slide into a recession"
"965240","970620"," heading into the end of this year and into next year. "
"971360","972660"," It's not going to matter."
"973780","979300"," You have a slowdown of production, you have a slowdown of people producing more than they're being"
"979300","979680"," given."
"980900","988420"," And when that happens to our economy, and you also have the politics of the presidency, you have"
"988420","994600"," the politics of the Fed that they're going to consider, and how late to the party they are, they"
"994600","997420"," should have cut off the flow of money last year. "
"999820","1004640"," And then I watched, I think it was spot gamma did a video this week and talking about how the"
"1004640","1010300"," Goldilocks trade in the rate increases was last year, and it won't be this year."
"1012580","1018160"," Up until about halfway through the Fed's bar, Jay Pao speaking on Wednesday, I was like, Yeah, this"
"1018160","1018720"," is all good."
"1019920","1020920"," This isn't bad. "
"1020960","1021760"," And none of this is bad."
"1022180","1025980"," And then just got to a certain point where you figured out there was ultra hawkish."
"1027359","1033060"," And it led me back to what I think is going to take place now. "
"1033380","1037280"," So, I'm going to show a spy chart."
"1037420","1038540"," I'm going to make this chart very simple."
"1038819","1040859"," And I'm going to come back and show you this chart later on. "
"1041500","1049120"," But my new price, my price target was down to about 390 or so, with a nice sideways range."
"1050000","1051900"," It would look like 2018, 2016."
"1054120","1057000"," But I'm now down somewhere here. "
"1057620","1063500"," I'm now down somewhere I think it's 326 right about there."
"1066520","1072800"," So that's where I'm at between now and I can get this right again."
"1073400","1073760"," Hold on here. "
"1075120","1076920"," I don't even know if I can get this on the chart here."
"1079200","1090500"," I'm on this trade coming back now by end of year with it"
"1097960","1107660"," roughly December, somewhere back to the spy down to 326."
"1108440","1114500"," Now, we have another issue when we're talking, we're just bringing you back to talking about when"
"1114500","1116820"," we said we have to hedge yourself in this market. "
"1120200","1129800"," You're also going to see the tail risk over here is high again in the market."
"1130800","1138940"," And not only is the tail risk high over here, but we haven't shaken out bulls yet."
"1139160","1141920"," You notice right where we haven't shaken the bulls out of the market yet. "
"1142960","1144280"," They haven't become fearful."
"1144840","1146880"," And we talked about that last week, right?"
"1147080","1151180"," We're not seeing the selling that we should be seeing the panic down in here."
"1151960","1155940"," And the reason we're not seeing the panic down in here is because everybody is hedged over here. "
"1158100","1163200"," But the other problem is we haven't seen the Venerale in here for a couple of weeks."
"1163420","1168620"," And the reason we haven't seen the Venerale over here in a couple of weeks is because not only is"
"1168620","1176000"," everybody hedged to the tits, any rips that we get is just another opportunity to re hedge."
"1178520","1180560"," And there is no place to hide. "
"1180760","1181880"," You can't hide in bonds."
"1182640","1185320"," Sometimes bonds go down in March 2020."
"1185980","1190680"," I mentioned this last week that you couldn't hide in bonds in March 2020. "
"1191260","1194960"," They didn't correlate to going up as the market went down."
"1196240","1198420"," And that's going to take place in here as well."
"1199000","1204100"," I think you're going to see a continued bearish bond market alongside this pullback in our market. "
"1204960","1214640"," So if you can't hedge in bonds, then you can't hedge in equities or traditional"
"1214640","1223680"," value equities or you can't hedge in mountain or in Disney or in some other trade that's that's"
"1223680","1224780"," supposed to materialize."
"1225900","1228370"," There's only two things you really do."
"1229190","1232890"," You can only buy puts, right?"
"1233470","1238490"," You can eventually, and if you keep buying puts, like where we are right here, if you just keep"
"1238490","1245050"," rehaging and rehaging, right, the implication into this is that Joe and I were talking earlier,"
"1245230","1252570"," it's like, well, once those puts expire, we should go up. "
"1253130","1258830"," But if we're not replacing those puts with calls, so let's say we put a hedge on, right, a put"
"1258830","1264730"," hedge, and then we then would then as those as those put hedges are timing out, right?"
"1265090","1266490"," They're getting closer to expiry."
"1266830","1269730"," If you're replacing with calls, you will get the Vanna rally."
"1270790","1275930"," But if you're not replacing with calls that are outside the money and farther data out, if those"
"1275930","1279250"," aren't there, that whole gamma trade is out. "
"1280130","1287590"," And what happens is, without with no replacement, like a magnet, you're then drawn down towards"
"1287590","1288690"," where that hedge was."
"1290330","1293010"," And it leaves for an elevated VIX."
"1293970","1299770"," And if we rehage, let's say we have a small snapback, just a tiny one that we did last week,"
"1300730","1306510"," and you're rehaging then, you're further amplifying a downward move overall over time. "
"1307690","1310090"," And you can't hedge with all these value companies."
"1310350","1311110"," You can't hedge in bonds."
"1311690","1312510"," Where do you hedge?"
"1312990","1316290"," Well, you hedge inputs and you hedge in buying the VIX. "
"1317970","1324490"," There's a whole tail risk VIX product that is now the prettiest thing on the street."
"1326890","1333810"," Now, there is a chance that we could trade higher, that we could, if the Fed was going to come"
"1333810","1336670"," out, let's say, they're always late."
"1337510","1339210"," But they were going to cut checks, everybody. "
"1339590","1342190"," And sure, we can break this resistance."
"1342210","1344610"," You can see these two points up here, right?"
"1344730","1351330"," That 4.79. And that last snapback rally we had should send us down over the year, end of the"
"1351330","1351490"," year."
"1351650","1351770"," Okay?"
"1352330","1357410"," Now, even if we trade higher to this resistance here, I don't see us breaking across this plane for"
"1357410","1358130"," the rest of the year. "
"1360770","1363450"," I see us trading down the rest of the year."
"1363670","1365430"," And there are some broad implications in this."
"1366250","1368670"," You've got YouTubers and personalities. "
"1368670","1370750"," You've got big bulls out there."
"1371190","1374450"," You've got you've got Bill Ackman's out there, right?"
"1374690","1378130"," Right now at this point, in my view, I think they're lying."
"1378610","1384150"," I think they're either just putting, let's say, let's say Blackman's got, he says I bought Netflix. "
"1384810","1391470"," Maybe he's placing 5% into Netflix or 1% in Netflix, just in case the economy, you know, that"
"1391470","1397230"," the probability chart, right, of what could possibly happen, that we possibly go up here."
"1397490","1401510"," Maybe he's spending 1% on Netflix or Microsoft."
"1402250","1404130"," But I think they're lying to you out there. "
"1404650","1406350"," I think they're running for the fucking hills."
"1407170","1412250"," I think that I think they're invested in buying the VIX and that they are the ones hedging this"
"1412250","1413030"," entire market."
"1414170","1415410"," There's other problems out there. "
"1415470","1417190"," You get guys like, I'm not going to mention their names."
"1417830","1420710"," But they're going to talk to you and tell you that they're going to buy the dip."
"1421470","1422810"," They're going to buy quality stocks. "
"1423950","1432830"," And I saw one guy, specifically yesterday, changes tune to, you have to now look out three to five"
"1432830","1433090"," years."
"1433810","1439030"," So if you're going to follow me and I've built my entire reputation on being a bull, we're going to"
"1439030","1440350"," buy these dips all the way down."
"1440350","1442810"," But now I want you to not think about this stock. "
"1443370","1446510"," If it fails, then I will print this year."
"1447090","1449490"," I want you to change your view point to three to five years."
"1451510","1456230"," Because I don't think some of these guys out there can change their position of being a bull or"
"1456230","1461950"," change their image or change how they sell themselves as being. "
"1464730","1465950"," And that's a problem."
"1466510","1468430"," That's a major, major issue."
"1469950","1475650"," We, in my view, I don't think that I mean, I'm going to keep this channel going for this year,"
"1476270","1481350"," but I don't think the channel will grow with not trying to attract people willing to piss their"
"1481350","1481810"," money away. "
"1484230","1487110"," So I don't think traders and investors want to hear that."
"1487250","1490510"," I don't think investors want to hear this is not the time to buy."
"1492090","1495430"," I don't foresee a time to buy this year. "
"1497110","1499270"," Anything right now."
"1499730","1500330"," Energy."
"1500690","1502690"," You could buy energy right now forever long. "
"1502850","1503530"," That trade lasts."
"1506710","1512410"," But at this point, my viewpoint has it's gone."
"1512650","1516010"," I don't want to call it ultra bearish, but it's pretty bearish. "
"1518470","1527910"," This is a year of we might have to change our viewpoint to selling every single rip to buying the"
"1527910","1528390"," VIX."
"1530230","1540050"," To put our money elsewhere to look for other places where we can grow cash or at least maintain the"
"1540050","1541730"," level of inflation every year."
"1541730","1545910"," If you're not actively trading the market, I'm going to have a hard time. "
"1546890","1555690"," It could happen, but if you want to buy stock, it would have to be highly managed for however long"
"1555690","1556170"," you hold them."
"1556210","1558470"," It could be anywhere from a one month to three months at most."
"1560450","1568110"," But my viewpoint on the macro view of our market is changing rapidly. "
"1568970","1570310"," And I think you're seeing it."
"1571690","1575790"," I think you're seeing it in the background on the mechanics of how the market is working right now."
"1576370","1578070"," You're seeing it in the volatility levels. "
"1578310","1581730"," You're seeing it in the swings that we're making in the market right now where."
"1583010","1586650"," You're making a hundred percent on a trade that just moved a hundred points, right?"
"1587030","1587950"," Or 50 points in"
"1587950","1598090"," a"
"1598090","1598090"," day."
"1598090","1599750"," That's three thousand percent on those moves. "
"1602210","1603450"," We'll look at it right here."
"1604810","1607950"," We printed down from 420 up to 440."
"1609350","1611550"," That should have been a monster. "
"1612570","1617270"," Trading down the next day, down another, you've traded down from 440."
"1618050","1620950"," 440 in the bell down to 427."
"1620950","1625210"," Same day traded back up to 439, right?"
"1625410","1629870"," Then traded down in the future or end of the day down to 430. "
"1630310","1631410"," Then back up to 444."
"1633230","1635090"," Back down again down to 430."
"1636010","1638610"," And you should be making huge money. "
"1638690","1645690"," We're making money, but not like if this is a regular market with fed liquidity."
"1646890","1649830"," With fed cash coming into our market."
"1652710","1657270"," He did drop some other news the other day about the treasuries, right?"
"1657490","1661310"," The banks we buying treasure, but not corporate debt, right?"
"1661590","1663170"," You let that slip the other day. "
"1663830","1669650"," There's some real mechanical problems in the Goldilocks trade."
"1669650","1677550"," There are real mechanical problems in our economy that will affect our market this next year."
"1678030","1683050"," Before the Fed meeting, I figured we'd have somewhere between one to three months from the damage"
"1683050","1684110"," that was created here. "
"1684830","1686110"," This would be a one to three month recovery."
"1688270","1696310"," When we traded down to 420, it extended that recovery out to possibly six months, maybe June, July."
"1696310","1701310"," And then the conversation that the Fed had and that Jay Powell had the other day leads me to"
"1701310","1704210"," believe that we trade down into November. "
"1706150","1713650"," And probably December 1st, we trade down probably up until December."
"1715750","1718030"," So, you got 168 viewers here."
"1718710","1726170"," I need you to know this moving forward that will more than likely be my viewpoint for the rest of"
"1726170","1726530"," the year. "
"1727750","1730010"," And that's something material changed."
"1731290","1733630"," The material change would lead."
"1734210","1739630"," I had a viewpoint that we would have this higher rip to, but this would create an uber bubble or"
"1739630","1740850"," huge bubble of some kind. "
"1740850","1743930"," We'd trade up to 500, 600, 650."
"1745750","1747770"," And I don't think that trades there anymore."
"1748110","1753130"," I think we're accelerating our economy moving into a recessionary phase. "
"1755630","1760110"," Now, with that all set, we break this over here."
"1761130","1762050"," We can have that talk."
"1762490","1764750"," We break this huge trend downtrend. "
"1765590","1768390"," This huge resistance, I think, is here into end of year."
"1768390","1770690"," We start to make all-time highs."
"1771070","1775670"," I'm more than willing to switch my viewpoint and become bullish again. "
"1775830","1785190"," But from my viewpoint, from this point forward, unless we see some major shift, major shift in"
"1785190","1791690"," monetary policy, that's our trade for the rest of this entire year."
"1798290","1800490"," So, that's my take on our market."
"1800490","1802850"," I want you guys out there to realize that. "
"1802950","1804530"," I was thinking 750 on Tesla."
"1805290","1809490"," I think a price target now in Tesla of down to the mid 400s."
"1811470","1813490"," I thought worst case scenario, 650. "
"1814390","1816090"," I've got him in the 400s."
"1816570","1819150"," I've got Disney down to like 80 to 100 bucks."
"1822210","1824570"," I don't know how else to say to you guys out there. "
"1825370","1832730"," I don't want to scare anybody or I don't want anyone to think that this is not on the table."
"1833190","1836250"," This is rationally on the table for the equities market."
"1838170","1843990"," There are larger banks out there and hedge funds that are planning for this. "
"1844070","1844830"," I want you to know that."
"1845350","1846390"," That is happening."
"1847330","1851330"," Even if they tell you that that's not happening, that is happening. "
"1857440","1857960"," Tesla."
"1861320","1864520"," I don't know if I've lost viewers over this at this moment."
"1865220","1867380"," I hope I haven't. "
"1867720","1869060"," I'm the biggest bull out there."
"1869280","1871040"," I'm a pretty big bull out there."
"1871460","1873820"," I'm a pretty big known for buying the dip out there. "
"1874500","1876600"," And I don't see it coming up."
"1876920","1878800"," Just any guys are trading today."
"1879420","1881900"," We should trade between 430 and 440. "
"1883440","1887460"," If there's a capitulation moment, it will happen today or Monday in my view."
"1888620","1893860"," You'll see a capitulation when we talk about getting some put spreads on Wednesday instead of"
"1893860","1895940"," dating them for Friday to date them for Monday."
"1897220","1899600"," I think that trade is still viable. "
"1900380","1905300"," I don't think you'll see the trade down today unless overwhelming hedging comes in or overwhelming"
"1905300","1906460"," put flow comes in."
"1907940","1913740"," But I want to warn you that every time we trade up to 440, people are re-hedging."
"1914480","1918620"," Every time we trade up there, they're not hedging long right now. "
"1920440","1921460"," They're hedging short."
"1923180","1929400"," And as we start to trade down like this, right, and as more and more people hedge, let's say we"
"1929400","1932600"," trade up to 440 and someone throws another hedge on, right?"
"1932600","1938160"," And they're re-hedging, they're re-extending where those puts are, the dates on those puts, even if"
"1938160","1942140"," they're just in the money, they're eventually going to print."
"1943760","1945460"," So it could take today, it could take Monday. "
"1945460","1946340"," It doesn't really matter."
"1949000","1950120"," So that's what you're going to see."
"1950180","1955060"," It's almost like an inverse, VANA rally or VANA trade, almost like an inverse. "
"1955300","1960540"," You can pretty much turn your computer screens upside down and that's what's taking place."
"1962160","1964980"," And that's what you're going to have to trade is that trade."
"1965260","1965980"," So we'll look right here. "
"1967620","1970680"," Under normal circumstances, you'd look at this kind of a trade here."
"1973240","1975140"," And you can see this line that I just put on."
"1976820","1978180"," This goes right to December. "
"1981080","1986680"," We should follow this track down over the rest of the year."
"1986680","1991160"," And this looks like a VANA rally is setting up, right?"
"1991920","1994440"," That the shorts will cover and close their positions."
"1995520","2003760"," That you'll see a huge swarm of buyers stepping in to trade this up to, let's say, 464. "
"2005400","2012040"," Even if they do, unless you see massive calls above it, 480, 500, you're not going to see that"
"2012040","2012240"," though."
"2012740","2017180"," You're not going to see people thinking we're trading a 404, 8500 in the next month."
"2017920","2019640"," You're not going to see it in March either. "
"2020820","2024280"," It's going to get steeper and steeper as we head down here."
"2025280","2028200"," So this is why you'd be aware of that as time goes on."
"2032420","2035400"," I'll bring a book map here in a minute so you guys can have that for the day. "
"2036320","2038140"," But I can know you guys are seeing this."
"2038140","2044140"," I know there are uber ultra bulls out there that see this trade under normal circumstances."
"2045380","2050580"," I would expect no less or I would be looking for either a sell down here for a rip higher. "
"2051480","2051980"," Right?"
"2052239","2056980"," I look for the bears to take a couple tries and wax it down below, not get it trade higher."
"2057520","2061360"," Typically, this is setting up for a huge trade into Monday into next week."
"2061800","2064900"," We'll be looking for this trade into the first week of February. "
"2066500","2071560"," I think that anytime we trade up here, you're just people are just waiting."
"2072920","2076800"," You've seen Tesla trade down below 800 today."
"2078280","2078719"," Right?"
"2078920","2079960"," Trade under 790. "
"2080100","2081060"," I think at one point this morning."
"2082100","2083040"," I don't know what they're at right now."
"2083139","2084520"," They're at 845 now. "
"2086420","2087880"," They trade down to 795."
"2089639","2092060"," You still have by the dipper stepping in."
"2092060","2096060"," But you still have a class of investor like it. "
"2096580","2102320"," You still have hedge funds and banks out there that are waiting for their their moment."
"2103300","2104960"," Wealthy individuals for their moment."
"2105840","2108380"," To get anywhere in this vicinity up here. "
"2109200","2110440"," To re hedge."
"2111460","2114200"," Okay, so it's the opposite of the vanity trade."
"2122170","2129630"," Oh, so this morning I woke up at 4 a.m. And it traded right down to like 972. "
"2131430","2134750"," But that trade is only good for a day a week."
"2135430","2136270"," And it's going to go down."
"2136810","2138310"," Hoods hoods going to go down. "
"2138990","2140230"," I thought they were going to go up."
"2140390","2141210"," They had a chance of coming up."
"2141350","2143010"," I didn't expect the. "
"2144070","2149970"," I didn't expect ER to be good."
"2149970","2151690"," I think it's something that has to be managed."
"2152890","2153650"," I don't think it's anything. "
"2153870","2155090"," I don't think it's anything you can say."
"2155210","2158490"," I'm going to dollar cost average hood because it's coming back."
"2159190","2161270"," I think hoods going to trade down over the next year. "
"2163310","2163710"," Absolutely."
"2173180","2175960"," I need to get I need to get this out there for you guys."
"2176260","2178700"," I need you guys to have that viewpoints understanding. "
"2179640","2181240"," Now with that being said, right?"
"2181760","2185460"," That does not mean that you just hedge the market right where we are today."
"2186140","2188540"," And then you expect that it's just going to keep going down."
"2189020","2191320"," There are going to be moments where we go higher where we go lower. "
"2191780","2194380"," There's lots of opportunity for bulls to buy rips."
"2194860","2196380"," There's lots of opportunity or this."
"2196820","2198920"," You still have to trade it and take profit. "
"2199780","2204760"," It's not like you just get all full full on bear and say, I'm going to go bearish right here."
"2204920","2205980"," And that's the end of it."
"2206040","2206220"," Okay. "
"2206800","2212440"," You still want to be taking short positions, taking put positions."
"2213540","2217700"," And VIX positions if you want along the VIX at the right times."
"2218140","2220240"," You don't want to just go all really nilly. "
"2221420","2222420"," Yes, you could."
"2222980","2224100"," But you can."
"2224660","2229720"," But you want to wait for opportunities to take this short over the course of the year. "
"2231140","2234100"," But this is definitely a solid rip market."
"2235500","2243020"," And I need to warn you that in my view, if you're going to follow me this year, that that's"
"2243020","2244700"," how I'm going to trade this market."
"2245520","2251640"," I'm going to be trading this market looking for opportunities to short it down into the end of the"
"2251640","2251840"," year. "
"2253860","2256040"," No matter how high we trade in here."
"2256320","2258320"," This is all opportunity to short."
"2259320","2260880"," It is not this opportunity. "
"2261200","2262880"," This used to be the opportunity down here."
"2263300","2268740"," You'd be waiting down here and saying I can't wait to buy this bottom so that we can trade higher."
"2269980","2270140"," Right. "
"2270260","2272260"," I'm not seeing that accumulation right now."
"2272720","2276360"," We've traded here one, two, three, four, day five."
"2278080","2279900"," And there hasn't been a massive accumulation. "
"2282840","2285260"," So I need you guys to understand that out there."
"2285360","2285500"," Okay."
"2286080","2288000"," As a bull, I need you to understand that. "
"2288380","2291760"," Let's say you're buying the dips and companies after they're burning through their ERs."
"2293080","2294480"," For example, it would be hood."
"2296220","2298320"," How far can it go down right from there?"
"2299200","2300480"," You look at Disney right now. "
"2300560","2301040"," It's had one."
"2302940","2305300"," Disney is a prime company to look at right now."
"2305300","2307020"," You look at a company like Disney. "
"2307940","2309640"," It's going to bring Disney up real quick."
"2311920","2313280"," Now, they're at $135."
"2315540","2321720"," And if we just start trading down in March, you can see Disney down at 110. "
"2323220","2323800"," Easy."
"2324900","2327920"," Down 110 bucks if the market continues to sell down."
"2328220","2330120"," Just look one to three months out. "
"2331320","2332840"," You start to see Disney at 110."
"2333620","2334080"," 115."
"2334980","2335500"," Right. "
"2335640","2338080"," They're not that far away from trading down to 100."
"2338920","2340180"," Down to the 80s."
"2340840","2345160"," They start to think about companies like Tesla, starting to think about companies like Apple. "
"2346260","2347340"," They're going to get repriced."
"2347900","2349940"," I was thinking that Apple could trade down to 130."
"2350600","2351820"," I think it's going to go lower now. "
"2352580","2356000"," I think the market conditions will take them lower."
"2356600","2362320"," I think that bulls think, I think that even I think to a point, well, price matters on a stock."
"2363120","2365100"," That bulls aren't going to care if it's 90 bucks. "
"2365520","2366360"," They're going to buy it."
"2366600","2367920"," And they probably will buy it."
"2368640","2373840"," But market conditions can take the price of a stock down, whether you're willing or not. "
"2373840","2379240"," You can buy $90, but that doesn't mean that the market's not going to still take it down lower,"
"2379680","2381360"," even though you're buying it."
"2387290","2388970"," Scalping FDs are going to be fire."
"2390110","2392670"," And you'll have some defined trading ranges, which is good. "
"2393590","2395950"," There should be lots of volatility this year."
"2396830","2401730"," In the market, you'll see some defined trading ranges, and then we'll trade down."
"2402470","2404040"," Just look at this as upside down. "
"2404040","2407120"," I think of this as an upside down bull market."
"2408320","2410540"," I think of it just like an upside down bull market."
"2410700","2413540"," Eventually, this sideways trading is going to head down. "
"2414280","2418160"," It's not going to head up, if that makes sense."
"2418680","2421060"," So you're looking to short anywhere up in here."
"2421400","2428080"," So if you had like a, if you had like a, I don't know, the polyline, I guess I can"
"2428080","2428420"," do it. "
"2428560","2431860"," This program kind of sucks to be trying to do this."
"2431860","2433860"," But, you know, you're looking for anything up in here."
"2434720","2443080"," Anything you see up in here, you're looking, you're looking to buy short anything, if we even get"
"2443080","2445740"," up in here for this next move down, right?"
"2445940","2451420"," Let's say we trade higher, if we trade, even if we trade up in here, even if, if there's an"
"2451420","2457320"," outlier, even if you have an outlier where we trade up here, we bust up through here. "
"2457540","2458780"," It's eventually coming down here."
"2458780","2459780"," Does it make sense?"
"2460520","2465780"," Or even if it trades sideways in here for a little bit, it kind of, this nonsense, right?"
"2466280","2468500"," It's going to eventually trade down, trade down below."
"2469500","2471920"," It is the point that I'm trying to make to you out there, okay?"
"2472900","2474800"," And eventually, it's going to get trapped. "
"2475060","2481040"," It's going to continue down on this chart, on this channel right here."
"2481200","2482880"," We are creating the channel right now."
"2483220","2485820"," If you can't see it, it's here. "
"2485820","2487680"," This is this channel."
"2488120","2489440"," We're here, we're going down."
"2490520","2495060"," And we're more than likely heading down the entire year. "
"2495440","2499280"," It's more than likely not going to end until end of year."
"2500800","2509500"," And there's ramifications on a macro viewpoint that are going to impact this market into end of"
"2509500","2509840"," year minimum."
"2511580","2521420"," I would be very wary of any relief rally that you see that trades above 440. "
"2523760","2525520"," Very wary, very wary."
"2526040","2532180"," I would be very wary of thinking we're getting any kind of Vanna rally that you've been used to,"
"2532500","2538460"," where you see five straight days of up or three straight days of up, that you see a huge liquidity"
"2538460","2540200"," come into the market as it rips higher."
"2541460","2548100"," Even if we were to trade, even if we're to trade from, let's just say, on an outlier that we"
"2548100","2556240"," traded straight up here, the 461, I guarantee that you don't make the money that you would have"
"2556240","2559400"," made had their bet in liquidity provided. "
"2560600","2566960"," So even these trades, if they were to do this, are not going to provide the money that you think"
"2566960","2567500"," that they are."
"2568000","2570860"," So yeah, you can do relief rally trades."
"2571140","2572180"," I don't think we go this high. "
"2573620","2574700"," I think they're going to be subdued."
"2575000","2579620"," I think you've got sellers waiting above here at every moment."
"2579620","2583800"," I think you're just waiting just waiting for more sellers to step in here. "
"2587040","2592840"," They'll do like a one, two, three trade, one, two, and three and then take it lower and every stop"
"2592840","2595000"," everywhere above here, that's what you're going to see."
"2597780","2598940"," So I want you to be aware of that."
"2599140","2600340"," I want you guys to understand that. "
"2603140","2605440"," And where I am with this market right now."
"2605800","2608480"," And I've got the numbers to back it up."
"2609260","2615320"," So I'll do a video for you this weekend showing the numbers, showing that we're in a bear market. "
"2622200","2624100"," Yeah, we're in a bear market."
"2624860","2626000"," Be aware of that."
"2626120","2627360"," No one's telling you that out there. "
"2628180","2629260"," We're in a bear market."
"2629280","2630100"," That's what we're in."
"2632280","2633220"," We don't trade. "
"2633480","2634920"," We're not going to trade up like we did."
"2638360","2640180"," In 2016, 2018."
"2641660","2643460"," That's not in the cards right now. "
"2645300","2647720"," If you see gas, keep going up like it is right now."
"2649520","2654020"," You're just going to murder paychecks on people murder."
"2655620","2657880"," You know, you and I might make a lot of money. "
"2659280","2661360"," I don't know how much money you make out there."
"2662480","2665440"," If any of you else, if let's pretend you're not in the market."
"2666300","2670940"," Pretend that you're Mary who goes to a nine to five job during the week. "
"2671780","2673960"," You're John who has a nine."
"2674080","2675780"," He makes a hundred thousand dollars a year as an engineer."
"2676640","2677460"," That's his income. "
"2679240","2679660"," Right."
"2680340","2681200"," You got taxes."
"2681640","2682820"," They're going to take place this fall. "
"2684340","2687140"," Or the proposition of higher taxes this fall."
"2687860","2691320"," There are so many ramifications to Mary and John."
"2691980","2694700"," And they're hundred thousand dollars in their brand new house. "
"2694700","2698400"," They just bought and they're sixty thousand or eighty thousand dollar truck."
"2698520","2698980"," They just bought."
"2700380","2704760"," The taxes being a going higher gas prices being higher. "
"2705800","2707660"," That you've got shortages."
"2710280","2715420"," They're going to impact that they don't get any more free money that their tax rates go higher."
"2716120","2719700"," All of these things are going to be an issue. "
"2720920","2724240"," For Mary and John to pump money."
"2724900","2726260"," Into this market."
"2726840","2731500"," To buy stuff to buy goods and services in this market. "
"2731800","2734040"," And the shortages coupled with that."
"2734910","2737000"," I was watching Tesla the other day."
"2737160","2737780"," Tesla's ER. "
"2738720","2744380"," And the only part of their guidance that I didn't agree with."
"2744900","2746220"," Was their growth."
"2747540","2752340"," I think that I think that the big mistake that you're going to hear in this ER cycle. "
"2752840","2753560"," In their in guidance."
"2755320","2758180"," Is that companies are going to grow this year."
"2758180","2760880"," I think when that comes to roost. "
"2761440","2762440"," And the next."
"2762900","2767420"," Our cycle is where you'll start to see the first round of capitulation."
"2768320","2771840"," I think you see the first round of capitulation at some point in March April. "
"2773920","2777280"," We'll recover from that one when it will make those moves down."
"2777840","2779840"," With the most severe moves down."
"2780400","2783580"," When we come into the September October quarter. "
"2783920","2788060"," I think that's where full capitulation will take place into December."
"2795430","2796870"," The Russell is complete."
"2797310","2800270"," I thought the Russell would have some great volatile ups and downs. "
"2801350","2804110"," If there was a trade that's the most profitable."
"2804890","2806410"," It's without a doubt going to be the Russell."
"2806630","2809190"," The Russell is going to move down. "
"2810070","2811730"," More so than even the S&P."
"2811850","2813830"," The S&P will be slightly more resilient."
"2815490","2816670"," Even though it'll trade down. "
"2817290","2819410"," The Russell is going to give back a lot this year."
"2820310","2821510"," That will be the bit the largest."
"2821890","2822730"," That'll take the biggest hit. "
"2823310","2824150"," Without a doubt."
"2824490","2826550"," And there are numbers coming out right now."
"2827450","2829450"," Of people are not spending their money. "
"2830210","2833170"," Where we think they're spent the reopening trade."
"2833990","2836170"," They're not spending the money that we thought that they would."
"2837390","2840970"," It looks like it's busy in Florida in the bars in the restaurants. "
"2841570","2844070"," But for the lot of the United States it isn't."
"2844170","2847190"," If you drive around the suburbs of sleepy America."
"2847750","2851010"," I'm not talking about like the cities or whatever. "
"2851010","2855310"," You drive out into the suburbs and you'll see that they're quieter."
"2856310","2859930"," You'll see that Park City just cancelled a bunch of events."
"2861330","2866530"," Park City for this summer just cancelled major, major events that they have. "
"2868150","2871970"," Major they bring millions and millions of dollars to that ski town right."
"2872250","2874050"," In the summer time all cancelled for this year."
"2874610","2876270"," You go to a drive into the suburbs. "
"2878190","2878890"," They're canceling events."
"2878890","2880030"," You go around."
"2880310","2881810"," Halloween I noticed it first. "
"2882410","2885090"," They didn't have any events."
"2885350","2886130"," There was nobody out and about."
"2886650","2892830"," I noticed it during these past holidays and you're going to notice it in these communities that"
"2892830","2898970"," even politically they could be politically, publicly saying open the schools, open this, open that. "
"2899550","2901330"," We have to have everything open."
"2901970","2904810"," But they are not out and about doing stuff either."
"2904810","2909690"," Even though, you know, the main street had on your hair, people say. "
"2910450","2911590"," We have to open up all this stuff."
"2912130","2916050"," But even those people are not going out and spending their money on services."
"2917870","2918770"," They're not doing it. "
"2922330","2923070"," Everything is well."
"2923270","2923610"," Everything is great."
"2923830","2926530"," I had an internet issue on my house. "
"2926870","2928810"," I had a Comcast guy out on Wednesday."
"2930050","2931810"," I wanted to turn the internet off on FMCD."
"2932530","2933230"," I'm like you have to come back. "
"2933230","2937630"," So I came back yesterday, had the internet off all day long yesterday or through midday."
"2938370","2939330"," And then I just took care of some."
"2939630","2941910"," I'm going to try to sell some houses here. "
"2942490","2947330"," I'm going to try to get rid of my property and the next from now into April."
"2948270","2950850"," I'm going to work on starting to sell some of my places."
"2954670","2957930"," Joe's saying that his trade show calendar is 50% cancelled. "
"2960830","2962890"," Yeah, why you guys to pay attention to this stuff?"
"2962890","2964830"," Why you guys to be paying attention?"
"2964930","2970390"," There's some numbers out there right now on the reopening trade that are not good."
"2971750","2972850"," It's not good."
"2973410","2975350"," And it's people not having the money. "
"2975650","2977590"," It's people have purchased everything they want to buy."
"2979950","2982170"," They've got inflation through the roof."
"2984190","2985730"," You've got fear of taxation. "
"2986390","2989190"," You've got tightening on lending."
"2991710","2992610"," No easy money."
"2992890","2996010"," As a matter of fact, I'm not going to book. "
"2996210","3000950"," So I know someone who works for a large company."
"3004050","3006510"," And they were they had a hiring spree."
"3007530","3008810"," And so they were offering. "
"3010130","3012250"," The bonuses and higher rates of pay."
"3012970","3014130"," All this stuff, right?"
"3014250","3017450"," This is a large national company."
"3018470","3020590"," And they were in this big hiring spree. "
"3022610","3028790"," Let's say they're paying people $45 an hour, $10, $20,000 signing bonuses."
"3029690","3031370"," And they've now pulled those back."
"3033450","3037090"," So you're going to see pay go down as well this year. "
"3037850","3040690"," You've heard that pay has gone up on a national scale."
"3040950","3044510"," These large companies are now not offering that those higher pays."
"3045990","3049810"," You have inflation that really is here, whether it's admitted or not. "
"3050770","3051470"," You have tightening."
"3054330","3054830"," Taxation."
"3055430","3056650"," And rate increases. "
"3059530","3061930"," And so my target is down for the on the year."
"3062690","3064030"," And recession by end of year."
"3064570","3070270"," My take into next year to become full on full blown recession or for people to feel it. "
"3071110","3073370"," You'll see it'll take a year and a half."
"3073370","3077810"," It usually takes longer for capitulation."
"3078590","3081670"," They'll take the stock market, probably the entire year to capitulate. "
"3082390","3088810"," It'll take the guy that's, you know, these aren't the wealthy people and these aren't people that"
"3088810","3089710"," are poor."
"3089930","3093670"," It's that middle upper middle class that is overextended."
"3094110","3102470"," They won't feel the real pinch until next year, halfway through the year and possibly into 2024. "
"3102470","3106110"," 2023, 2024, somewhere in there is where the pinch will be felt."
"3107010","3115950"," And when it's felt by that class of people, that's when you have issues in the market, real issues"
"3115950","3116470"," in the market."
"3116750","3117730"," We've seen this in the past. "
"3118310","3123490"," If we saw it in 2007, I remember when it happened in 2007, we should have a pretty decent year"
"3123490","3125250"," or generally speaking won't notice it."
"3125810","3127330"," You won't notice that side of it."
"3128710","3133290"," And you won't notice, like, you won't notice where people start to lose things, right, where they"
"3133290","3137690"," lose their truck, their house, where they lose their second or third home, where you have more"
"3137690","3139610"," houses being sold than people want to buy. "
"3140230","3144930"," You won't start to see that stuff until 2023, 2024, somewhere in there."
"3145850","3153750"," But right now you are seeing the tightening for Joe and Mary out there or, you know, Bob and Mary,"
"3153750","3159070"," whomever they are, they're seeing their own tightening as it impacts our economy."
"3159490","3162370"," So that's my take on our market. "
"3163130","3164070"," It's not stagflation."
"3165680","3167270"," It's not stagflation."
"3167270","3168730"," I will talk about that this weekend. "
"3171190","3171730"," Yeah."
"3171730","3171810"," Yeah."
"3174090","3178190"," You know, it's not a, it won't be a big short that we think that it is. "
"3178850","3182790"," I think it's, I think it's more of just a slowing economy."
"3184090","3188950"," I don't think that it's, it's going to be that nasty, but it's a slowing economy."
"3188950","3189570"," It's a tightening. "
"3190010","3191470"," So it's not just from the Fed."
"3191670","3194230"," It's from households down to the household level."
"3195450","3199970"," And so you'll see this tightening in our economy and it's cyclical. "
"3200430","3202230"," I don't think it's a long term debt cycle."
"3202230","3204770"," I think we're more on the short on a short term debt cycle."
"3205110","3206970"," So only it's going to be as nasty. "
"3207250","3211830"," Usually the period only lasts on a short term debt cycle event like this."
"3211990","3215610"," It should last, usually it should last three to four years."
"3216630","3220490"," It's not 10 years or 20 years or anything like that. "
"3220610","3222490"," I don't see it being that nasty."
"3223170","3227450"," But it's a, it's a comeback down to, come back down to a normalcy level."
"3228210","3233690"," And so it probably will probably take, I would think anywhere from one to three years at max. "
"3233930","3237830"," It's not that long, but one to three years that that would be what I would anticipate."
"3245920","3246320"," Yeah."
"3246480","3247560"," And I'll be honest with you. "
"3247860","3248860"," I'll be honest with you."
"3248920","3252400"," For any argument that you've got out there, right, that Tesla's going to go to 1200."
"3253720","3258100"," I called 650 just the other day, but we got down to 790. "
"3258660","3260920"," So there's no argument, right?"
"3261600","3265900"," And this, there's no argument for closer to 750 right now."
"3266620","3268720"," Then we are to 1200 right now."
"3269800","3270320"," And 1400. "
"3271200","3275800"," And I called 750 back in, I think November or December somewhere in there."
"3276240","3279260"," So we're closer to my target."
"3280220","3288020"," Then we are to anyone's target of 1200, 1300, 1400, any of those numbers. "
"3288920","3290300"," And my target's now going lower."
"3291440","3292220"," It's going down."
"3293060","3294220"," And that sucks to say. "
"3294880","3299440"," And some of that is the dollar, the dollar going up as well, as it as the dollar gets more"
"3299440","3301740"," valuable and inflation, right?"
"3302280","3308240"," When you have inflation and the dollar going higher rates, taxes, all these things, there will be"
"3308240","3309960"," re-pricing in our equity market."
"3310600","3311280"," You're going to see it."
"3311600","3312000"," I promise. "
"3312720","3315000"," I promise you'll see a re-pricing of the equity market."
"3315420","3316540"," Now your dollar will go farther."
"3317140","3321760"," And even though you have, even if you have a price of Tesla that's down at 650 or 400 or"
"3321760","3327220"," 450, there'll be more value in that stock though. "
"3327760","3331200"," So I got to, I got to preface that at the same time."
"3332740","3338900"," I want you guys to realize at the same time that even though the, like right now what that price"
"3338900","3342760"," tag looks like, that $800 looks like to you right now."
"3342760","3345600"," How you perceive the value of $800?"
"3346520","3352800"," It's not worth as much right now, but as the dollar increases in value, a lower price makes sense. "
"3356810","3363130"," Yeah, and there won't be, and there won't be the money and the sidelines is not coming into the"
"3363130","3363430"," market."
"3365330","3366370"," It's not coming in."
"3373760","3376720"," So yeah, I don't know what else to say on that topic, but I'm going to say that for you"
"3376720","3377000"," today. "
"3377320","3382460"," So with that being said, with all that being said, I will put out a video this weekend."
"3382700","3386560"," It'll probably be recorded because I need you guys to have this information."
"3387160","3396360"," I need you guys to consume it for yourselves and then research it so that you can agree or"
"3396360","3396640"," disagree. "
"3400380","3402260"," You're not seeing the bid today."
"3404040","3405340"," You're not seeing it today."
"3407380","3409900"," Across the options market, you're not seeing it today. "
"3410580","3412140"," You're not seeing it in volume."
"3413240","3417500"," The accumulation phases, the dark pool trade, you're not seeing it."
"3419980","3423100"," But for today into the weekend, I'm going to let you know that I expect us to trade. "
"3424920","3426820"," Inside of that be range bound, right?"
"3429500","3434120"," We should be range bound today, even we should be raised bound no higher than."
"3434800","3435720"," Right here."
"3441630","3444250"," I expect rejection no higher than 440. "
"3445230","3451610"," More than likely you'll get rejection today at 434 or 435 possibly trade outside to 437."
"3452970","3455670"," I find it hard to believe that we traded up to 440."
"3456010","3461550"," Maybe we have some short covering to 440 so that people can close out their shorts over the"
"3461550","3463950"," weekend, which is just standard operating procedure. "
"3463950","3468490"," You might see that, but I don't think that you see a trade into 450, 460 next week."
"3469370","3471030"," I think that's I think that's off the table."
"3471470","3475710"," I think any trading higher right now is just another opportunity for someone to take short. "
"3480460","3484260"," Yeah, I will have some trades for you."
"3484520","3490060"," If you have cash that you have on the sidelines that you need to deploy that you need to keep"
"3490060","3496360"," invested to keep up with inflation, I will have some options for you heading into Sunday so you can"
"3496360","3500260"," look into those alternative asset classes."
"3500780","3504660"," These alternative asset classes do not include Bitcoin in any way, shape, or form. "
"3505440","3507760"," I've become even more bearish on Bitcoin."
"3509320","3514460"," The drawdown on Bitcoin should get nasty cryptocurrencies as well."
"3522240","3524240"," Yeah, I'll bring a book map right now for you. "
"3525220","3526360"," I'll turn this off."
"3529400","3531160"," Bottom has gone lower on book map."
"3535240","3535860"," I'm here. "
"3538130","3545290"," I think it was that at 420 yesterday and today or no Wednesday and today."
"3546830","3547910"," We'll look at it right now."
"3549210","3551190"," I'm sorry to be so bearish with you guys out there. "
"3551190","3555750"," I don't want you to take my overall bearishness for me."
"3556130","3562130"," You will see me in the broadcast skip bullish on a day or get bullish on a trade."
"3562590","3564010"," You'll see me take longs. "
"3564070","3567570"," It's not like I'm not going to take longs with you or that I won't get bullish."
"3568470","3575290"," But my viewpoint in the market, my view on what's going to happen this year has turned quite"
"3575290","3575970"," bearish."
"3575970","3581950"," I need you guys to know that that perspective will be in the background of my trading for the rest"
"3581950","3582490"," of the year. "
"3584250","3587010"," Okay, so that doesn't mean you get crazy bearish and you're like, that's it."
"3587090","3587790"," I'm all in short."
"3588570","3589570"," Don't do that, please. "
"3590490","3591510"," That's like a bull do."
"3591630","3592910"," They bulls do that stuff, right?"
"3593070","3598950"," They just buy whatever and hope that a prince don't don't do that because there are going to be"
"3598950","3600970"," some great great bull trades in here."
"3600970","3609310"," The bull trades should pay better in a lot of respects than the bear trades because the bear trades"
"3609310","3610870"," are going to get more and more priced in. "
"3611330","3616850"," You're going to see the cost of bear trades increase over the next, the rest of this year as well."
"3617550","3619990"," You're not going to see the bear trades will become more pricey."
"3620910","3621990"," You're seeing that right now. "
"3622150","3623990"," You're seeing about puts are expensive, right?"
"3624390","3630230"," So that's a normal indicator when you see puts expensive that they need to get cheaper before we go"
"3630230","3631210"," down again."
"3631550","3633590"," But I think you're going to see even the price of puts."
"3634290","3639210"," If any of you guys traded March of 2020, puts got stupid expensive. "
"3640150","3644910"," They didn't get cheaper because they just kept getting more and more expensive as time move"
"3644910","3645290"," forward."
"3646970","3648090"," I think you're going to see that."
"3648090","3653430"," You're going to see the premium just get absurd and put options at some point. "
"3654350","3658730"," I think you're going to see elevated VIX into the end of the year."
"3662170","3668030"," And you'll see VIX drop off even if we're trading sideways as well, but it's not going to be like"
"3668030","3671490"," a once was where we're trading VIX under 10 bucks, 9 bucks."
"3671650","3672370"," It just won't get there. "
"3672750","3674170"," People will buy it before it gets there."
"3684640","3688260"," Yeah, if that's going to say something else to consider regarding Tesla from a statistical"
"3688260","3691940"," standpoint, 9% of all gaps up end up being filled."
"3692400","3694560"," There is a gap in Tesla from 435 to 415. "
"3695320","3696540"," Yes, I charted Tesla."
"3696800","3700340"," I've charted a few of these out to see how they correlate for the end of the year."
"3702740","3704520"," I apologize for saying this stuff. "
"3705000","3707780"," There is no massive support on IWM."
"3712080","3713120"," It's not the charts."
"3714600","3717080"," My viewpoint has zero to do with charts. "
"3718380","3719860"," It has nothing to do with charting."
"3720540","3723680"," It has all to do with a."
"3729800","3736100"," I don't explain it with technical technicals that have come out into the market."
"3736100","3743500"," Not technical indicators on the chart indicators, but hard numbers on our economy from macro"
"3743500","3743940"," perspective. "
"3744720","3750100"," We have macro numbers that are coming out that are public information that are telling us where"
"3750100","3750520"," we're heading."
"3755610","3757550"," Nothing has nothing to do with charting."
"3758190","3764730"," These are internal things happening within our economy and within our stock market that are going"
"3764730","3766170"," to impact the equities market. "
"3781930","3785090"," We'll take a look below in the Spyro quick and then we'll go closer here."
"3785430","3786770"," Just make sure we get a firm target."
"3789650","3791830"," We were just the heads up. "
"3791950","3792910"," You can see here, right?"
"3793510","3795930"," These are just localized buyers from today."
"3796530","3800830"," But if you recall, we had a nice level of support down below at 420."
"3801250","3803450"," It's now gone lower down to 410. "
"3804170","3805030"," It's going to be our 412."
"3806930","3808110"," It was at 420."
"3810130","3811050"," It's now lower. "
"3821220","3823720"," We'll try to have a look above here and see where the real sellers are."
"3828020","3833800"," We've got sellers stepping in at 435.83. On the Spyro, we'll look higher and see if they can break"
"3833800","3834060"," through."
"3872060","3874480"," You can see the sellers have showed up in force here. "
"3900850","3901150"," Hang tight here."
"3901290","3904450"," We'll scroll above once this loads up."
"3905710","3907710"," Try to get a nice vantage point. "
"3916000","3917340"," Good morning, by the way."
"3917880","3920860"," I hate being the bearer of bear news."
"3927560","3933240"," We're going to look above here and see a price target higher. "
"3943500","3948100"," 450 and just traffic above here."
"3951850","3953150"," Traffic up to 440."
"3954550","3955510"," Right in here. "
"3955710","3957890"," This is all considered ICE right here."
"3963140","3964320"," Negative here indicator."
"4006940","4008280"," 133, 131. "
"4009440","4010560"," It's a little bit larger."
"4019790","4020690"," Let's look above."
"4024530","4027370"," It's just sellers as far as the eye can see here. "
"4028510","4029550"," Just a wall of ICE."
"4031850","4032870"," You see this here?"
"4033670","4034850"," I guess be aware of this here."
"4037410","4041290"," I want you to see this wall of sellers above. "
"4043550","4056060"," All right."
"4060150","4063930"," You have now become master trader, which is terrible."
"4064470","4065850"," I don't want to be master trader. "
"4068830","4070470"," I didn't want to even make this."
"4070610","4075870"," I didn't even want to make this video or say this stuff."
"4076550","4078510"," I always trade the market in front of me. "
"4078810","4084410"," If we trade higher, if we break through that major resistance, I'm all game on to turn bull again."
"4084970","4086950"," I can get bullish in a day."
"4086990","4087570"," That's no problem. "
"4087830","4088790"," Bullish in a week is fine."
"4089510","4095870"," The macro view over the course of the year is not the past two years."
"4096950","4103910"," If I have this bull viewpoint on a year, that is no longer. "
"4105130","4107069"," Do I think we're going to 600?"
"4107710","4112270"," Do I think we're going up to that mega bubble that we're supposed to have, that uber bubble?"
"4112850","4114790"," I think that's off the table right now."
"4117529","4118250"," It sucks."
"4119090","4120069"," I don't want to be that guy. "
"4120910","4123810"," I'm not the guy that's saying, I don't think we're going to crash today."
"4124410","4126270"," Nothing's like a market crash ahead of us."
"4127090","4132630"," I think there'll probably be two market capitulation moments from now into end of year. "
"4132770","4138990"," I think the first one will be in March, April during the next year round."
"4139970","4147649"," Because we have such high expectations so far in guidance, I think that that will turn."
"4148090","4156350"," I think the first capitulation move is going to be guidances that come out in Q2 with lowered"
"4156350","4157890"," growth expectations in the year. "
"4158569","4165710"," And then I think that the trade down into the fall will create a capitulation sell move from retail"
"4165710","4166729"," traders specifically."
"4179620","4187819"," My viewpoint has been, my viewpoint up until this point was a defined bottom as a trade sideways"
"4187819","4189580"," and then up into end of year."
"4191080","4195960"," And my viewpoint has changed to, I don't think we see a defined bottom this year. "
"4196720","4200640"," I think we trade sideways to slightly down the entire year."
"4201400","4204120"," But a couple capitulation moves put in there."
"4205820","4208260"," I think that's my, I think that's my major concern. "
"4211000","4215640"," So today, if we get up to three, four, if we can get up to four, 40 today, I will"
"4215640","4218720"," take another short position at the end of today."
"4228930","4231190"," David will just prolong his calls like he always does."
"4234230","4241200"," Yeah, I don't want to say this to you guys. "
"4242580","4244320"," I don't think it matters when we sell off."
"4244520","4246880"," I don't think there should be fear of when we sell off."
"4246880","4253500"," I think that you just have to realize that there is a class of, there's a class of investor out"
"4253500","4255000"," there where there's a class of hedge fund. "
"4255160","4259340"," There's a class of bank that are, they need to have the VIX go down."
"4260220","4262560"," You need, they want to take profit."
"4264580","4266660"," And they want to re-enter again to short the market. "
"4266660","4272520"," So this isn't like a, this isn't like expect big red bars down straight to the depths of how"
"4272520","4273360"," anything like that."
"4274260","4281000"," There's one bear that was on this channel that was saying that has just been short since 4.79. You"
"4281000","4285700"," shouldn't be short from 4.79 and just hold until the end of the year."
"4287760","4290260"," Because it's just like bull market. "
"4291700","4297800"," You want to trade it up, take your money and run and then wait for the next opportunity to re "
"4297800","4298380","-short the market."
"4300200","4306800"," So you can't look at this like, I don't want you to look at this from the perspective of, I"
"4306800","4311180"," don't want you to look at this as a perspective of, we're going to have red bars down from now"
"4311180","4312180"," into end of the year."
"4312360","4316340"," I want you to look at it from the perspective of, when you're trading or when you're an investor,"
"4317560","4320180"," you're looking to buy a bottom and ride it up, right?"
"4320740","4325160"," If you're going to make this a bear market, you're going to look for a moment that you can enter"
"4325160","4330980"," into a short trade, take it down in the market, let loose that stuff, let it trade back up and"
"4330980","4332000"," then trade it back down again. "
"4332820","4336260"," But if you think we're going to the right and up, we are not."
"4336580","4339720"," We're going to the right and down on average."
"4339980","4341860"," And that should continue into end of year. "
"4342000","4350780"," I thought I would initially, my plan was March, then this past month it moved into slightly June,"
"4351360","4357200"," probably June, and then after I did some research, this past few couple days since the Fed meeting,"
"4357200","4361120"," and it looks like it will roll into end of year."
"4379860","4382660"," So I've got the numbers for you guys."
"4382960","4385180"," I will make a video this weekend. "
"4385540","4386560"," You will have this video."
"4387220","4393600"," It will show you the data from the government west, what to expect into the rest of this year, and"
"4393600","4395900"," it is nothing short of absolutely negative."
"4396320","4403620"," The implications in our economy and how it impacts the equities market is large. "
"4404380","4406100"," There's nothing that you can't get around it."
"4407340","4408420"," There's no getting out of it."
"4409040","4410920"," There's nothing that the Fed can do to get around it. "
"4411780","4413820"," With politics, there's nothing to get around it."
"4415580","4421800"," Just the production side of the US, the GDP of the United States is 3%."
"4421800","4429640"," And when you have a normal GDP of between two and 3%, and when you're pumping money into that GDP,"
"4430280","4433740"," it turns into something that it's not. "
"4434660","4439860"," And we're removing that from our economy is going to be, it's like taking the crack cocaine away,"
"4440600","4441320"," which is fine."
"4441580","4447060"," I mean, hopefully you trade it up while the crack cocaine was there, right?"
"4447280","4448600"," And then you're able to make lots of money."
"4448680","4450040"," I made lots of money in this market. "
"4450260","4454240"," I'm very happy for the money to be made in this market, but I just don't see."
"4454880","4460620"," They would have to take the Fed to pump money again, like major money, like direct paycheck kind of"
"4460620","4463300"," money, like giving you a paycheck."
"4471160","4472120"," It could happen. "
"4472120","4473440"," I will say this too."
"4473620","4479360"," So Andrei Crouch is saying, I wonder if he thought the Fed would change their mind and keep heading"
"4479360","4479900"," out free money."
"4480160","4481620"," You know, I want to warn you of this. "
"4482420","4486820"," It would never shock me to see the Fed do something like that."
"4487420","4490560"," We are at an age of modern monetary theory being applied."
"4491580","4493700"," And if it gets ugly enough, they would. "
"4494060","4496140"," We would never shock me to see something like that."
"4496780","4500860"," But I want you to also be aware that rates can be removed in a recession."
"4500860","4502400"," The rates can go to zero. "
"4503900","4508760"," That's we can have all the right recipe for the market to go up."
"4509220","4510740"," And it will still trade down."
"4512700","4513860"," Because of other factors. "
"4517360","4518020"," So we'll see."
"4518180","4518720"," So I want to know."
"4518920","4519260"," Let me know. "
"4519460","4520340"," Do you guys think that?"
"4520660","4524240"," Do you guys think that you that we're going to get a Vanna trade that we're going to get a"
"4524240","4524840"," Vanna rally?"
"4525480","4527920"," So if we got a Vanna rally, we should be trading to."
"4529560","4530920"," So a normal market, right?"
"4531060","4533040"," If this is a normal market, we're getting a Vanna trade."
"4534120","4535420"," It should go to. "
"4537080","4537480"," 468."
"4539660","4541820"," Do you think we get the trade to 468?"
"4556150","4557390"," I just think that you take."
"4557790","4562810"," I think that you if you're along this market, I think you wait for a moment where you can get"
"4562810","4563010"," out. "
"4564190","4565350"," I can't even tell you that."
"4565390","4566110"," I'm not going to give you guys."
"4566110","4571570"," When it comes to this kind of stuff, I can't give you guys financial advice. "
"4572150","4574930"," I can't tell you when you should or if you should."
"4575350","4580550"," I think that you at I think this at this point in the moment in the market, you need to"
"4580550","4581730"," do some due diligence."
"4581730","4584950"," You need to do some research that is not listening to CNBC. "
"4586130","4587450"," Not listening to Twitter."
"4588190","4590310"," I think you need to look at some numbers from hard numbers."
"4591490","4593730"," And on your own, you need to come to a decision. "
"4594230","4600150"," If you are for the year, bullish, neutral, or bearish."
"4601410","4603390"," I think that you can still follow me if you want."
"4603490","4606330"," You can still trade against me in a bullish on a bullish context. "
"4606490","4610810"," I think for yourselves, you need to find out what you are for the rest of this year."
"4613570","4615190"," I see people out there."
"4615270","4620490"," You see like blackman saying there's a bunch of other guys out there saying that they're buying"
"4620490","4620990"," these dips. "
"4620990","4624330"," You guys have to find out what your take is."
"4624670","4627570"," We can still be friends and trade together and all this kind of stuff."
"4628330","4629490"," You can trade against me. "
"4629610","4630490"," That's fine."
"4630870","4631190"," We can disagree."
"4631530","4632090"," That's all fine. "
"4632670","4638170"," I think it's important for you as an investor and a trader to have your perspective for the rest of"
"4638170","4638490"," the year."
"4638990","4646830"," I'll give you guys a synopsis by Sunday so that you can at least see where I'm coming from."
"4647790","4650870"," When it comes to big moves, you guys have your own wealth. "
"4651410","4655430"," You guys have to decide when you want to sell or if you just stay in and just short."
"4655930","4658430"," There are other ways to make money in this market."
"4658590","4659970"," You guys can stay long in this market. "
"4660370","4661990"," You can sell covered calls above."
"4662650","4663730"," You can buy hedging."
"4664190","4665230"," You can long the VIX. "
"4665610","4668570"," There's all kinds of strategies on your own."
"4668790","4671470"," You have to figure out what you need to do."
"4672810","4673750"," What's best for you?"
"4673750","4674810"," Those kind of things. "
"4675470","4679990"," I don't ever want to get involved in telling you guys what to do in that kind of stuff."
"4680530","4682910"," We'll sit here together and we'll trade the market every day."
"4683110","4687730"," We'll pick up longs and shorts every single day, day in, day out. "
"4688650","4691950"," We'll look for those opportunities on both sides of the trade."
"4692970","4699150"," I just need you guys to know where my view is, my macro view on our markets and for this"
"4699150","4699370"," year."
"4715250","4716850"," I can't do that for you. "
"4718930","4721670"," I'll tell you, like the last two years, right?"
"4722330","4726550"," The last two years, my viewpoint on a macro level has been bold."
"4727290","4727970"," Like I am bullish."
"4728750","4730570"," I am buying every single dip. "
"4731550","4733910"," I am buying knowing that it's going up."
"4734950","4737610"," And I am not doing that now."
"4739650","4741070"," So I need you to know that. "
"4741070","4747590"," It's a very important key part of myself as an investor and as a trader."
"4749070","4751130"," To me, this is not the bottom."
"4751430","4754710"," And if I miss this bottom, I'm okay with it. "
"4754810","4756450"," I was not okay with it the last two years."
"4756930","4759270"," If I missed the bottom, I would be upset with myself."
"4760070","4767170"," For me to become bullish again, we would need to make all-time highs, just all-time highs and then"
"4767170","4767790"," trade higher. "
"4767790","4772530"," For me to even take a bullish standpoint for the market."
"4774510","4775750"," Which is pretty high, right?"
"4776110","4781630"," You're talking we'd need to hit 480 and then we would need to trade higher from 480 for me to"
"4781630","4782850"," once again get bullish."
"4785070","4787170"," As of right now, we're not near that. "
"4789450","4792910"," Everything is traded the other way."
"4793310","4799310"," And at every moment that we trade higher, people are getting short, big institutional institutions"
"4799310","4800010"," are getting short."
"4801410","4803310"," And I know that they're telling you that they're not. "
"4803710","4805150"," That's bothering me deeply."
"4805910","4811450"," I don't like when institutions are out there telling you that this is the bottom or close to the"
"4811450","4811730"," bottom."
"4812130","4819030"," I didn't mind it so much before Wednesday, but right now anything that I hear out of the mouths of"
"4819030","4824370"," anybody saying this is the bottom or close to the bottom, I think that they're lying to you. "
"4824370","4827230"," I think that they're going to trade it up just so that you believe it."
"4827770","4833810"," You're going to be the one holding the bags and I warn you, there have been years like this in"
"4833810","4837470"," the past, 2007, 2001."
"4838770","4842310"," The ones that I know are the mid to late 80s. "
"4842950","4843810"," It was like 86, 87."
"4845670","4847750"," I remember that one specifically."
"4848570","4851930"," I remember 2001 specifically and I remember 2007 specifically. "
"4854950","4857730"," And trust me, you will be the last guy holding the bags."
"4859410","4860430"," Not no one else."
"4860950","4865930"," It's always the retail trader at the end of the day that ends up holding those bags. "
"4871790","4872790"," Yeah, that's what you're going to get."
"4872950","4874150"," You're just going to get the day trading stuff."
"4875190","4876310"," Yeah, I was out for a day. "
"4876410","4876690"," I had internet."
"4876970","4878750"," My internet was off for a day."
"4879590","4882810"," And then this morning I was late because I was talking to Joe for a little bit. "
"4883930","4886230"," There's a few other guys I need to start talking to out there."
"4886410","4891570"," I know Ben Ben G wants to start talking on the side and stuff."
"4891850","4894830"," So I'm going to have some other commitments that I'm trying to make to people. "
"4897850","4899210"," So we'll see if we trade up today."
"4899310","4900930"," If we get this, do we get this?"
"4901130","4902570"," The question is, do we get the advantage?"
"4902830","4907090"," I'm assuming that all of your questions are right now is, do we get the Vanna trade?"
"4907970","4909470"," And I don't see the Vanna trade."
"4909470","4913470"," I see heavy sellers coming in between 435 and 440. "
"4915650","4918870"," I think this is an opportunity above here to take the market short."
"4919690","4924390"," If we can trade up, if we get the luck of trading up to 440, I will take this short."
"4925150","4927790"," We may or may not get that luck into the close today. "
"4928210","4930170"," I would expect some short covering today."
"4931070","4935790"," You lean off the market for a minute and then you lean back into it, heading down."
"4937850","4944770"," If we see overwhelming call structure, if we start to see like $10 million trades on calls, I'm all"
"4944770","4945150"," on board. "
"4945330","4946330"," I'll jump on there with you."
"4946710","4950090"," But otherwise, I just want to look for some relief into today."
"4950970","4953690"," And then I expect us to trade down into next week. "
"4963540","4965080"," How do you spell that V rally?"
"4969760","4971320"," V for victory, baby."
"4971980","4975600"," Yeah, I like good rallies."
"4975840","4976640"," Don't get me wrong, right?"
"4977100","4977960"," I love a good rally. "
"4978560","4983540"," But you guys, dude, so that quote unquote V shaped rally we had on the 24th."
"4984860","4985760"," I remember."
"4987400","4990160"," I remember that day at the end of the day going on Twitter. "
"4992480","5000580"," And not only were people pumped, but a whole mess of people held long into the 25th."
"5000580","5001500"," A whole mess of people."
"5002280","5005940"," A whole mess of people got caught with their pants down that next that following day. "
"5006720","5007260"," I know they did."
"5008440","5009300"," They got burned."
"5011640","5012640"," They got burned hard. "
"5012860","5013960"," And so that's my fear here."
"5014060","5018160"," The same kind of a fear is you take the trade for the day."
"5020020","5021260"," Or even just a 440. "
"5021640","5022240"," Then you get out of it."
"5022360","5023120"," You take the short trade."
"5024000","5024700"," We end up trading down. "
"5029830","5032410"," Yeah, I did cut my 500 C's on Wednesday."
"5032890","5033690"," I believe I cut them."
"5033970","5034690"," They for profit. "
"5035130","5035850"," Not much, though."
"5036050","5037710"," I think I made like 5% on them."
"5037970","5042310"," I'm still though inside of my arcade calls, which sucks. "
"5044530","5046510"," They're a little bit farther dated out too."
"5046830","5048170"," So I think I'm OK."
"5049870","5051170"," You know, that's a microcosm, right?"
"5051410","5053130"," I'm just looking for opportunity to get out of those calls. "
"5054750","5057410"," I'm still holding Peton puts right now."
"5059070","5062410"," And I actually bought some puts last night at the bell."
"5063350","5064130"," Like four 15. "
"5065290","5065570"," No."
"5066530","5069150"," Whenever that last little ripper was up for four o'clock."
"5069290","5075110"," I did get into some puts and they printed briefly this morning at the open to sold those wells in"
"5075110","5075590"," the full show. "
"5076850","5079750"," So now all I'm long right now is I'm long in our K."
"5080330","5082350"," I'm just looking for an opportunity to get out of that long."
"5082970","5085510"," So if we trade up higher here, I'll get out of that long."
"5085810","5089850"," I'm looking for an opportunity to sell above here at some point today. "
"5090710","5095030"," So if I can get it at if I can get it at the end of day or some way,"
"5095050","5096210"," we trade up nice and high."
"5097430","5100430"," We can trade like 440 right up here right where these guys are."
"5101010","5103510"," This is where I am right here looking for this trade right here. "
"5104630","5105850"," So we can trade up to 440."
"5106490","5109510"," I'm looking to take a short into the 18th."
"5109510","5111070"," Just re-up real quick. "
"5118520","5119340"," I'm not looking."
"5120100","5121040"," I'm looking at some."
"5121340","5122660"," There are some orders right now. "
"5123080","5124400"," There are some some bullish flow."
"5125360","5127320"," For February 18th, which is good to see."
"5128240","5133900"," Seeing this looks like all retail trading E.R. M.U. $75,000. "
"5134440","5134920"," A5C."
"5136540","5137200"," Peton calls."
"5137600","5139200"," I've seen Peton calls all day long today. "
"5140300","5141220"," Since the open."
"5141780","5143640"," I'm on the wrong side of the thing here."
"5148890","5151210"," Let me take a look through here and see what I'm saying. "
"5164660","5166200"," I'm seeing a lot of retail."
"5167400","5169100"," I see a lot of buy the dippers."
"5169360","5172180"," I want to warn you guys when we were seeing flow like this, right?"
"5174720","5176940"," Not a lot of this flow is banks. "
"5178180","5182080"," A lot of this flow that I'm seeing is just retail people fucking around."
"5185120","5187980"," None of this looks like a bank flow."
"5188560","5192460"," They might be hedge fund flow or day trader or boiler room flow. "
"5193360","5198440"," But none of this to me looks like a bank saying like a GSA and the market's going up."
"5201320","5202300"," None of this does."
"5203980","5205700"," It's all as the flow comes in. "
"5205760","5206700"," I'll keep listing it for you."
"5207040","5208940"," There's bullish flow coming into the market right now."
"5209360","5212980"," Generally speaking, it's all small money, $100,000, $200,000. "
"5212980","5216240"," I see Uber, February 18, 34 C."
"5218320","5228740"," Peton, more Peton calls March 18, 25 C for $180,000, $50,000 on the spy, $178 "
"5228740","5229480",",000 on the spy."
"5230480","5236240"," dated for today, January 28, 435 and 438 C."
"5238660","5240260"," All this stuff is for today."
"5241120","5242260"," All it is day traders. "
"5242260","5243500"," Boiler rooms."
"5244480","5246140"," None of it is that Vanna rally."
"5250160","5252420"," If you buy every dip eventually be right. "
"5254440","5256240"," That's not some of its retail flow."
"5256400","5263920"," Usually anything that's like 20, 30, $40,000 is all retail flow, like $35,000 to $40,000."
"5264900","5271260"," You don't see a ton of options flow in the 100 to $300,000 to $500,000. "
"5271260","5271740"," That's retail."
"5271740","5279460"," Some of it is, but some of its wealthy individuals, but a lot of that stuff comes from boiler"
"5279460","5287100"," rooms, comes from trading rooms within prop desks on banks, right?"
"5288320","5290020"," Small hedge funds, stuff like that."
"5290500","5296500"," But I'm talking like, you get the big boy that says, you know, buy 20 million, 30 million, $100"
"5296500","5296780"," million. "
"5297600","5298320"," That kind of stuff."
"5298680","5299760"," I'm not seeing that flow."
"5300360","5301960"," That's like market directional. "
"5302340","5303880"," This is where we view the market is going."
"5303900","5305400"," Right now, it's all down."
"5306280","5309340"," So this is all day trading stuff, market trading stuff. "
"5318710","5320070"," What's a price target to sell?"
"5320950","5323130"," It's not like Tesla can't trade up higher."
"5324750","5327970"," There will be moments of positivity in the market."
"5328170","5329850"," I want the way you guys to think for a minute. "
"5330410","5336670"," You're not going to have a great trading day or you're not going to have one big, huge rally at"
"5336670","5337190"," some point."
"5337190","5337690"," You are."
"5338190","5339770"," It's not like you're not going to get a huge rally. "
"5340350","5345450"," My point to you is remember the days where we would hit all time highs every week, right?"
"5345690","5346850"," One, two, three times."
"5347330","5348950"," I think those days are over for right now."
"5349410","5350150"," So just wait. "
"5350530","5354610"," If you're along in a position in this market and you want to get out of a long position in"
"5354610","5357470"," this market, just wait till you get a moment to where we trade nice and high."
"5357930","5360650"," You're going to hear all the bulls saying that the bear market's over."
"5360930","5366830"," We're going to a bull market and just wait for your opportunity to opportunity time to take, to get"
"5366830","5367850"," yourself out of those positions. "
"5370230","5371390"," And look to take a short."
"5375730","5383050"," So please do not take my, my conversation with you this morning as sell the news."
"5384510","5385550"," Please don't do that. "
"5387970","5388450"," Okay."
"5390290","5391110"," So what's this?"
"5391670","5396310"," So Robbie asked Cap, what about the QQQ orders that look like they came from the same person?"
"5396310","5399730"," All 14 April, three 55 P."
"5400150","5402490"," I haven't seen those as of yet, Robbie."
"5406520","5409600"," That was one of my last large trades. "
"5409880","5410560"," Oh, God, I'm thanks."
"5410820","5415380"," Yeah, I think I don't want you guys to get."
"5416060","5420780"," Don't take me as a, I'm not the bear that's like red bars to hell. "
"5421420","5426860"," But when I turn bearish, it's, this is more of just my perspective on the market."
"5432520","5434260"," So your price target above is 440."
"5436520","5437860"," We'll open this up a little bit. "
"5442680","5445980"," Right here, 439.89 looks like."
"5456340","5457820"," Yeah, you can DM me on Twitter."
"5462390","5465010"," Yeah, all in 400 P for tomorrow. "
"5465290","5465990"," Cap told me to."
"5466330","5472030"," I know that's my, that's my, uh, my thing is I don't want you guys to."
"5473410","5479050"," I don't want you guys to think the implication is that we have red bars down to, uh, you know,"
"5479090","5480730"," like 300 tomorrow or something like that. "
"5481210","5482470"," The market is still going to trade."
"5483570","5488250"," Don't think for a minute that the market's not going to trade as we go down swinging."
"5491450","5494330"," But I don't, I don't, I do think that this is not the bottom. "
"5494930","5496610"," I think that the bottom is end of year."
"5504900","5506340"," Yeah, then I see stuff like that."
"5506860","5507500"," Damn ripping. "
"5510940","5511900"," We should rip."
"5512840","5513420"," We should rip."
"5513760","5514460"," I hope that we rip. "
"5514600","5517000"," I hope that the, I hope that the rip is as big as we can get it."
"5519500","5521300"," I'm, I'm hoping that we go higher."
"5522660","5523740"," So that I can take it short. "
"5526700","5529240"," I hope that it goes as high as we possibly can."
"5530000","5534380"," It's, you look at it from the perspective of dunking someone's head under the, under the water."
"5535180","5535980"," You gotta let them breathe. "
"5537980","5544460"," Gotta let it breathe."
"5550730","5551730"," You guys kill me."
"5552110","5553690"," I always love the, I always love the pump. "
"5554130","5555170"," It's always out there."
"5570780","5574180"," My arcade calls are somewhat doing better too, which is good."
"5586420","5589160"," So I was under water quite steeply on those calls. "
"5590400","5591580"," I was getting murdered on them."
"5595780","5598200"," I can get arcade up to like 76 bucks."
"5598400","5599240"," I'd have to be a happy man. "
"5603230","5605270"," That's really all I need is arcade to come back."
"5606670","5609930"," I can get an unfuck myself from my lungs."
"5621220","5623900"," We'll get a little bit more granular here so you guys can watch. "
"5624880","5626460"," See if there's any resistance above here."
"5640180","5644740"," And if you see any cooling off here, it should, if we end up getting sideways and down at any"
"5644740","5648880"," point, it should still rip higher into 440 at some point today."
"5649520","5651160"," Either now or by the bell. "
"5667250","5670490"," Try to bring that 440 down for you here so you can see it."
"5678280","5679120"," Right there."
"5685120","5686000"," Right there. "
"5694820","5699200"," You could possibly trade sideways to 435 or so."
"5699860","5702500"," Maybe a little bit lower and then trade, and then it'll trade higher to 440."
"5706640","5707980"," How are y'all doing out there?"
"5709260","5710700"," What do you guys think about my rant?"
"5716190","5718350"," Two about 10 trades, one, one of the 10. "
"5718590","5719570"," We'll go screw up here."
"5726290","5728370"," Yeah, Joe and I were talking about P-time today."
"5728610","5733670"," Anytime P-time goes higher, you just grab more puts and just your dollar cost average should go"
"5733670","5738430"," lower and lower so that you're going to get, the one thing you're going to know is you're going to"
"5738430","5742830"," get boiler rooms that want to trade it up and down over the course of time. "
"5742830","5749490"," You're going to get fluctuations when you enter into a trade that takes two, three weeks for it to"
"5749490","5750610"," come into the money."
"5751730","5756170"," I think my puts are, we were down at 23 or something lower today on P-time."
"5756650","5757490"," I didn't close them out. "
"5759070","5765730"," I'm holding puts on P-time because I want to hear what P-time has to say in their ER."
"5766570","5768490"," I don't think that there's anything that they can say."
"5768490","5772510"," I traded down a 22.82. The 22 puts printed this morning. "
"5772950","5779770"," I saw the big concentration on 22.80. It seems legit."
"5780090","5786730"," It should get traded like this heading into their ER, but for me it's a, what would you call it?"
"5787630","5792950"," It's a part of what P-time represents."
"5793790","5799390"," I remember that when I traded Nikola down, it was the same thing. "
"5799590","5800170"," I just heard noise."
"5800950","5807890"," Like I heard noise from the Nikola bulls that were upside down in their positions."
"5808390","5811470"," I heard all the noise from the Nikola subreddit. "
"5812350","5814370"," I heard all the noise from the CEO."
"5815370","5817190"," I just kept hearing it and hearing it."
"5817670","5819310"," I watched Nikola trade higher. "
"5820510","5821590"," I watched it squeeze higher."
"5821590","5822730"," It didn't matter."
"5824130","5825110"," It didn't matter. "
"5826190","5829310"," All you do is you just keep shorting it."
"5830050","5832410"," You just keep shorting it."
"5845280","5847580"," It should come up. "
"5848340","5850040"," My position on hood is this."
"5850740","5852920"," My position on hood is that."
"5856520","5859980"," I was looking to take it long for a year. "
"5862800","5867460"," I buy hood at nine bucks or 970 or whatever, and then I'm going to hold this for a year."
"5868980","5878020"," If you buy so me buying hood at 970 or whatever, do I hold it now until December?"
"5880780","5886640"," That's my take on, if you're going to be a stock buyer this year, it has to be heavily managed."
"5888400","5891560"," You could hold them for a week, two weeks, a month. "
"5892200","5897820"," It's not going to be anything where you can confidently buy a bottom and watch a trade up for a"
"5897820","5898160"," full year."
"5901910","5906890"," I don't think that I don't think hood trades up to $40 by end of year."
"5907130","5908270"," At this point, I don't. "
"5908990","5911870"," You'd have to break above $478 for me to see that happening."
"5913530","5915510"," Fundamentally, I had a problem with the E.R. statement."
"5916050","5917730"," They had more flow coming in on the spy, by the way. "
"5918430","5924270"," All for today, January 28, 437 C for $600,000."
"5924810","5926030"," You should say move higher to this 440."
"5927730","5929710"," I should tag this 440 here. "
"5931490","5940640"," A little bit of sellers coming in above here at 437.92 be aware of this, but we do have"
"5940640","5942260"," a bull stepping in right now."
"5945280","5952200"," If you're going to buy, you can buy stock and sell buy and sell stock at each level."
"5952800","5960660"," I was looking for a bunch of stock to buy this year that I could manage but not manage as"
"5960660","5963100"," closely as I didn't want to. "
"5963600","5965540"," You want to have to manage a stock every single day."
"5966640","5972720"," You do once a day, once a week, events that are coming up, you want to know if any bad"
"5972720","5974240"," negative news comes out in the stock."
"5975240","5981480"," To so intensely monitor a stock position with the risk that's in the market. "
"5982280","5984280"," I don't think there's much I'm going to be able to buy this year."
"5985260","5988200"," Unless it's just for a day or a week or a level."
"6003490","6004210"," Thanks, Rowley. "
"6004570","6005310"," I appreciate it, brother."
"6012410","6016570"," You know, it would be kind of funny, right, Michael, if Amazon split it with, you know, that would"
"6016570","6018210"," be the piece of the cake right there."
"6018870","6020090"," All right, Robbie, I'll check my DM. "
"6020090","6023070"," Yeah, this flows all day traders."
"6023670","6025150"," Just so you guys know, it's short covering."
"6025730","6028490"," You guys, so I want you guys to see something, okay?"
"6029010","6029990"," I want to show you guys something. "
"6030450","6034230"," I don't know all of you, right?"
"6034350","6036910"," I want to tell you what some of you guys might know this or might not know this."
"6037270","6039630"," So do you see how we're trading higher right here?"
"6040730","6043090"," It just keeps pressing higher and higher."
"6043730","6045830"," This is called, this is a real melt up, right?"
"6046630","6053630"," And what this shows, I want you to realize that what this shows is this is a short covering rally. "
"6054170","6058890"," This is not a Vanna trade, just to be just to be kind or I don't know if you guys"
"6058890","6061350"," know the difference between a short covering rally and a Vanna trade."
"6061930","6064410"," This is considered a short covering rally."
"6065530","6067430"," You'll see a slow grind up all day long. "
"6069430","6074050"," I don't know if you guys can see the differences in what the differences in a rally."
"6074050","6076630"," This is considered a short covering rally."
"6077330","6080910"," If you want to be able to identify a short covering rally, that's what's happening right here. "
"6087020","6090540"," I think, so I watched one of these guys this weekend, right?"
"6091660","6092420"," I was, yeah."
"6093620","6094820"," Dude, it wouldn't shock me."
"6094960","6097740"," Like if you saw an Amazon split, it would help, right?"
"6098060","6098060"," Totally. "
"6098480","6103220"," It would help the, I can't say that it wouldn't blast the market north or at least Amazon north."
"6105720","6107280"," It would be hilarious to see that."
"6110840","6113360"," We'll bring up Tesla real quick if you guys want to see Tesla. "
"6116080","6117300"," Yeah, that's my only problem."
"6117640","6121940"," That's my real fear right now is you can get trapped as a bull."
"6122460","6124100"," I love FOMO. "
"6124380","6128720"," I'm not going to lie to you and tell you, I'm not going to lie and tell you that I"
"6128720","6132400"," don't get consumed with greed as we trade higher."
"6133580","6136700"," I think that more so than ever before."
"6139040","6141300"," You take that long trade, but you sell it. "
"6141940","6142880"," You can't hold it."
"6143120","6147140"," You can't be like, you know, you guys know what I'm talking about."
"6147400","6148980"," I know you're assuming you guys know what I'm talking about. "
"6154220","6155380"," There's a huge difference."
"6156520","6160400"," You get about square way down in the dumpster and it was always going to go up."
"6160440","6163680"," You buy that, the underlying stock, just hold on to it, sell puts. "
"6165980","6168880"," You know, you can trade that, trade options on the dips and it was going up."
"6169760","6171780"," You could trade AMD back and forth."
"6172520","6175560"," But AMD was a kick ass trade, just traded it back and forth, back and forth. "
"6176160","6178600"," No fair at any time that AMD is going to fall off the side of the planet."
"6179260","6180480"," You knew there was a bottom to AMD."
"6180620","6182080"," You're like, this is a great stock to buy. "
"6182580","6184740"," It's a great trade, great option, great calls to buy."
"6185460","6188700"," Being SC, that ticker SC, for a straight year."
"6189540","6191340"," For a straight year, it ran a channel. "
"6192480","6194700"," It was just a printing machine going up."
"6196560","6197980"," It was unbelievable."
"6207970","6212350"," You could take SC and just trade it up in this one channel. "
"6212530","6212870"," It was amazing."
"6214330","6216510"," You know, I just don't think you can do that anymore."
"6223360","6227300"," Even though we're trading up here in Tesla, we're trading up here 860, right?"
"6227960","6230960"," Remember, just a week ago, we're trading in the thousands. "
"6231480","6233760"," Remember, a week before the hour, trading in the 1100s."
"6233840","6235940"," Remember, the week before the hour, trading in the 1200s."
"6236400","6241640"," Oh, no, yeah, a couple of weeks, but, you know, we start to become range-bound in much lower prices"
"6241640","6242060"," here. "
"6243540","6245200"," All right, dollar stepping in."
"6245500","6248020"," You are going to get panic at these levels."
"6248440","6253400"," You know that there are goals that are locked in from buying ER. "
"6255080","6256580"," Now, the need to get out, right?"
"6257480","6258240"," The need to get out."
"6259740","6265160"," All this stuff starts to set up the market trading down, right?"
"6265160","6265240"," Okay."
"6273700","6279160"," Short takes good smart bears, take the money and run, right?"
"6279380","6283800"," You've got sellers that will be hiding above on Tesla, hiding right now. "
"6284800","6285600"," One here."
"6289450","6290810"," We're up here at 860."
"6291590","6293490"," We've got a bumpy road here. "
"6294410","6295710"," Light resistance at 879."
"6296650","6298010"," More sellers hiding above at 890."
"6300090","6310340"," A lot"
"6310340","6312220"," of traffic above on Tesla. "
"6313260","6314060"," Right to 900."
"6314440","6315560"," This is where it could trade to."
"6317800","6322780"," I don't think it's going to get to 900, but if it did get to 900, you've got some pretty"
"6322780","6324040"," big wall of sellers here. "
"6330380","6338340"," And one other point to note, right, is you won't see a lot of capitulation while there's buyers,"
"6338740","6338780"," right?"
"6338980","6340520"," You're going to see people buying the dip."
"6340940","6347480"," You're going to see, you're going to see guys like Bill Ackman saying by the dip, you're going to"
"6347480","6348840"," see people telling you to buy the dip."
"6350700","6353780"," You're going to see people tell you all dollar cost averages stuff. "
"6353920","6354800"," You're going to hear everything in the book."
"6355040","6358220"," You're going to hear people say I'm going to buy it at 900."
"6358560","6363540"," You heard, you heard me Kevin say he bought the other day, right?"
"6363760","6368420"," If he got the best price he possibly could have, it would have been at the rock bottom at 850. "
"6368420","6372760"," And it traded down to 792, right?"
"6373100","6374620"," So he just broke even at this point."
"6375220","6378320"," Do you think that Kevin is going to sell out where he is right here?"
"6379420","6381460"," I think I might have my numbers wrong."
"6381600","6388640"," What I swore he said that he bought about one or two million dollars for the stock the other day. "
"6389380","6390260"," He bought back in."
"6390380","6391140"," I could be wrong in this."
"6392600","6394260"," I guess he bought at 850. "
"6394580","6398000"," I think that was the absolute bottom last time we were here."
"6398760","6401520"," I think a week or two ago, we've traded down 850."
"6402120","6405040"," Let's just say he got the best price at 850. "
"6406360","6410880"," So for two million dollars or one million dollars, he bought a million dollars in stock."
"6411600","6414780"," So we hit 792, I think today."
"6416080","6418560"," You think he's going to sell out of his position here. "
"6419100","6421700"," Now that we've hit 792, he might as well retest it again, right?"
"6421700","6424460"," I wonder how much did he lose?"
"6424700","6426620"," A couple hundred thousand bucks, something like that."
"6427780","6430000"," It's more than most of y'all making a year, right?"
"6438840","6443440"," They don't typically, they don't always reverse right away, but they don't last as long."
"6445640","6450640"," Yeah, Palantir had a ton of puts coming into it this morning before I came on. "
"6453280","6457420"," The short covering rallies tend not to last as long as a vanitrade."
"6457540","6459340"," A vanitrade will last like three days."
"6460140","6462180"," It just melts and melts. "
"6462880","6464280"," What you're doing is you're trapping."
"6465160","6469200"," So I want to explain the difference too in a short covering flipping to a vanit rally."
"6469620","6472640"," You'll see the vanit rallies start with shorts covering. "
"6475400","6477820"," And then you'll see a bid come into the market."
"6478880","6485940"," So right where we are right now, like 436, you should expect right now to see millions of dollars"
"6485940","6487100"," in block trades come in."
"6488280","6494260"," And then that short covering rally will be pushed to the next level of where shorts are. "
"6494960","6498600"," And then you'll see another wave of call action come in, like major call action."
"6499520","6502960"," And they'll be flipped again and they'll move higher and higher and higher."
"6504300","6510780"," So when you just see this short covering rally, if you don't see a heavy call hedging coming in"
"6510780","6512400"," right now, then you know that it'll just end. "
"6514460","6515660"," You'll see it be muted."
"6522780","6524420"," He sold on the 960 rip."
"6524660","6526420"," Yeah, I haven't paid attention to him. "
"6526940","6531840"," I didn't want I wasn't watching him for a long time and then pay attention to him last week or"
"6531840","6532120"," whatever."
"6532480","6534580"," And then I didn't pay attention to him again this week."
"6534580","6537720"," Someone commented that he bought another dip or something. "
"6541730","6543190"," So he bought it and sold again."
"6544050","6546650"," Is Santa, are you saying that he bought a dip and then he sold it again?"
"6555550","6556650"," Yeah, I don't know where we trade."
"6557290","6558390"," All I can tell you is this. "
"6558990","6562370"," There are sellers waiting to sell at nine hundred right here."
"6563230","6564110"," It's 60, right?"
"6565950","6570090"," You guys, we have to do, you have to do in the video on distribution too."
"6570990","6572690"," I have to do another video on distribution. "
"6580300","6584400"," I've never met Kevin."
"6590610","6591090"," Yeah."
"6591250","6593670"," So do I think we're in a bull trap?"
"6594270","6596090"," I don't think it's completely a bull trap. "
"6596130","6597530"," I think you're going to see shorts yet."
"6598390","6607450"," So bears want to see the VIX come down so they can buy the VIX and bears want the best"
"6607450","6610190"," positioning they can get to take short again."
"6611650","6613130"," It's probably at 440. "
"6615330","6621490"," And if we see something change, if we see something change, we'll flow with it."
"6621650","6628710"," If we see a bunch of calls come in, like if we see $500 million, $30 million, $10 million, you"
"6628710","6631930"," know, just banger calls up to 460, 470, 480."
"6632530","6632630"," Sure. "
"6633270","6634750"," We'll turn it into a Venerali."
"6638170","6643870"," But if we don't see that stuff, then if we don't see that in the close today, I'm going to"
"6643870","6644750"," take another short there."
"6645970","6648710"," And without a doubt, taking a short today, if we don't see that. "
"6650130","6657210"," I'll take, I'll take a 440P expiring on February 18th all day long right now."
"6658250","6660930"," Especially if the banks are in at 408 and 400."
"6660930","6665210"," And I get to take a 440 into the 18th of February. "
"6665590","6666410"," I'll take that all day long."
"6667070","6669410"," I'll take that trade all day long."
"6672070","6676950"," So you got him below 900 and sold at 960 exactly at the Fed FMC notes release. "
"6678250","6678930"," Good for him then."
"6679150","6679590"," He was smart."
"6679990","6680610"," He was really weird. "
"6681050","6687530"," Like when, so when Wednesday happened, we should have had a Venerali right at that moment."
"6688110","6690270"," And that was a problem that we didn't."
"6691870","6695250"," And the nail in the coffin for me was the end of the interviewing. "
"6695850","6697790"," Like that last half an hour or so."
"6698270","6699410"," I was like, oh shit."
"6701570","6708700"," Yeah, I'm glad that he was able to get out. "
"6708900","6710020"," He seems like a smart guy."
"6710320","6712240"," I don't think that the guy is not a smart guy."
"6712780","6718320"," You know, my big question about him is, can he switch to that to, like, you've built the channel"
"6718320","6722420"," around being a bull and you make your money off of being a bull. "
"6722600","6728440"," Dude, there's, so I want you guys to know, like, if I was just bullish all the time right now,"
"6728840","6730740"," I could probably monetize this channel."
"6731020","6733920"," And it wouldn't, it wouldn't matter if Tesla traded to the depths of hell."
"6734540","6741900"," If I could just soothe bulls all day long, regardless, because I could just come back on later in"
"6741900","6744400"," the afternoon and say, damn, look, it went down today. "
"6744940","6745760"," Doesn't that suck?"
"6746960","6747760"," It's all right, boys."
"6747980","6748560"," Let's pull it together."
"6748740","6749520"," We'll trade it higher tomorrow. "
"6750600","6751600"," Bull's don't care, man."
"6751700","6752020"," I'm a bull."
"6752260","6752860"," I don't get it. "
"6753000","6757560"," Like, you want to hear someone telling you, uh, everything positive."
"6757940","6761160"," You want me to, any of you guys want me to go out there, do my research on Tesla and"
"6761160","6765280"," say, you know, all these facts and figures say we're going up from here."
"6766120","6767900"," And it doesn't matter if Tesla goes up. "
"6768040","6770460"," I could just sell you guys some bullshit and make money off that."
"6771860","6773440"," I can't, so sorry."
"6777080","6778420"," So we should trade up to 440. "
"6778860","6779680"," 440 seems reasonable."
"6780620","6783700"," I don't know if it happens right now, but you should see 440 today at some point."
"6784540","6789720"," Even if we trade sideways and down into the close, then you see a short covering rally into the"
"6789720","6790940"," four right to four o'clock hour. "
"6791000","6792140"," You could see a short covering rally."
"6796080","6800000"," Uh, but even though there's a short covering rally, it's just another opportunity to take short"
"6800000","6801060"," right now."
"6803420","6812060"," You have to show me some news that is going to show me that the market's actually moving up. "
"6813500","6820340"," There has to be some data and some news that says we're going to trade the market, uh, to all"
"6820340","6820840"," time highs."
"6822700","6829400"," Because if you can't, oh, has he really?"
"6830240","6831960"," I haven't been paying attention to him either."
"6833020","6834300"," Sometimes he comes in my feed. "
"6834920","6836380"," He hasn't been in my feed recently."
"6836640","6839520"," I haven't been on my regular Twitter handle in two weeks."
"6839900","6843860"," I jump on there at nighttime and shit post, but that's as far as I go with it. "
"6844600","6845700"," I'll shit post on Twitter."
"6848880","6852040"," But I haven't checked out Master Wu in at least a week or two, two weeks."
"6852600","6854720"," I haven't checked out most people on Twitter the past couple weeks. "
"6855240","6856600"," Am I like the captain Jim James handle?"
"6857040","6862700"," I go out there and like do a ransom mill the night or something or stay some stupid shit during"
"6862700","6863540"," market hours."
"6868370","6869790"," Where's the smart money in Tesla?"
"6870810","6876090"," You know, you want to see above on you want to see above or below."
"6878190","6879630"," Where is the smart money in Tesla?"
"6879970","6880750"," They're selling right now. "
"6881530","6882470"," They're looking to get out of their lungs."
"6882770","6883070"," Trust me."
"6888820","6890720"," I haven't checked in on Brian Watt. "
"6890720","6892140"," I meant to haven't."
"6893680","6894860"," There's been a dumpster fire."
"6897760","6899420"," I'll look up Tesla right now for it. "
"6899420","6901200"," I want you guys to know you got sellers here on Tesla."
"6902260","6904460"," I'll get some big red lines real quick."
"6904600","6906020"," I'm going to switch over from Mary to. "
"6909000","6909780"," To Apple."
"6910520","6911840"," I'll try to take a look above."
"6913080","6915320"," Got sellers directly here at 860. "
"6915560","6916860"," They're saying, give me the fuck out of here."
"6918920","6923520"," You know, there's sellers hiding, right?"
"6924060","6925080"," I know you guys know there is."
"6930200","6932400"," Major sellers at 880. "
"6933620","6934180"," 898."
"6935240","6935800"," 908."
"6937140","6939340"," When did you guys get sellers trapped all the above the 1200?"
"6948020","6949700"," 900 seems like the spot. "
"6952120","6953880"," Easier diamond handers over here."
"6955080","6956000"," People are not saying."
"6957400","6960280"," If I just tell myself it's go back up, it will. "
"6976540","6977720"," DM your regular gym."
"6977980","6978580"," Just send us."
"6980160","6980760"," Thanks Robbie. "
"6980980","6981800"," I haven't checked yet Robbie."
"6986830","6987530"," Twitter's gone."
"6989270","6991890"," He's probably pretty fucking pissed off right now. "
"6992030","6992890"," I'm going to be honest with you."
"6993810","6996850"," Brian Watts probably pretty fucking pissed off right now."
"6996910","6998030"," I don't fucking blame him either. "
"6999550","7003150"," He got trashed on Twitter by a lot of fucking people."
"7005590","7009150"," And I've been a lot, dude, I used to watch everything Brian put out."
"7009750","7011510"," Brian's made me all fucked out of money. "
"7012370","7014230"," Brian was one of the guys that I would go to."
"7014410","7019490"," I checked with two or three guys out there to see if my thesis was right."
"7019890","7021910"," Like I had to get my thesis together. "
"7022370","7023970"," And I would go and check a few people."
"7024330","7025450"," And he was one of them."
"7025830","7027030"," And he's made me a lot of money. "
"7027030","7029010"," I went on a fucking rant about that."
"7029630","7034390"," I went on a fucking huge rant on fucking the..."
"7034390","7037030"," It wasn't so much Twitter personalities."
"7037750","7042370"," It was that they allowed comments in their posts where they ripped on. "
"7042670","7044430"," They got real fucking snarky on Brian Watt."
"7045590","7048850"," They go fuck a stick as far as I'm concerned."
"7049930","7050970"," I love Brian Watt. "
"7051990","7058880"," He makes great fucking calls all day long."
"7058880","7062660"," I trade with Brian Watt over 95% of Twitter."
"7063160","7063660"," Even now. "
"7066360","7068200"," You know, guys fucking fighting for his life."
"7068340","7070940"," And he's got a bunch of fucking ship bags."
"7071160","7072100"," That shit bothers you, right?"
"7073160","7077440"," Commandant, they'll say shit like Brian Watt said this, and Brian Watt said that. "
"7077700","7080140"," Brian Watt go fucking short along at any fucking moment."
"7080780","7083000"," I'll turn on a dime at any fucking moment."
"7083920","7088980"," So, you know, he makes a video or he makes a post where he says this will never happen or"
"7088980","7089740"," something like that. "
"7090180","7092860"," And if it does happen, I'm sure Brian was trading it down."
"7093760","7097420"," And trust Brian Watt is a trader over half those guys out there."
"7098300","7099140"," More than half. "
"7099540","7101480"," Like three quarters of them."
"7102680","7104440"," Look at Apple up here trading at 169."
"7106360","7111420"," Uh, above 179, 184, 197. "
"7112580","7113900"," Got support down here at 150."
"7115920","7117840"," I'll bring up the add-ons."
"7120760","7121200"," Um. "
"7129120","7130420"," Yeah, I wouldn't doubt."
"7130640","7133940"," I don't doubt that Brian Watt are shut it all down."
"7134160","7134760"," And you know what he should. "
"7135680","7140200"," If people don't show appreciation or at least respect, it seemed like it was across Twitter."
"7140460","7144380"," Like I was going through and I saw a lot of people should talk in Brian Watt."
"7144940","7149440"," And so if he wants to delete his channel and all of his information, fucking right. "
"7149700","7150200"," I would too."
"7150740","7153000"," You know, you pull it out and say fuck you."
"7153700","7155040"," Uh, there you go. "
"7155440","7157400"," You trade on yours on your own because I know Brian."
"7157520","7158540"," I know even it's funny."
"7158620","7162840"," The funny part about all this or the stupid part about all this shit is you get every fucking bear"
"7162840","7165400"," out there ripping on Brian Watt. "
"7166240","7167200"," And I'm going to myself."
"7168060","7168680"," Well, look at this."
"7169540","7171780"," They must fucking watch his ass every day. "
"7172560","7175260"," They're probably fucking watching him every fucking day because they're scared."
"7175340","7176280"," Show us to take a short."
"7176280","7178320"," Unless Brian Watt tells them to. "
"7178620","7181460"," And what's crazy is that Brian Watt is mostly short."
"7182700","7185700"," Like he mostly fucking shorts even on the way up."
"7186420","7189460"," So it's not it's not like Brian Watts fucking long most of the time. "
"7193240","7197740"," Heh heh heh."
"7197900","7198740"," Swear words and insults."
"7203500","7206220"," His Twitter handle is at real Brian Watt. "
"7207500","7208800"," Maybe at real Brian Watts."
"7209060","7210560"," I'm not sure if there's a mess in the end or not."
"7211900","7214500"," But, uh, it's kind of funny, right?"
"7214860","7220820"," You got, you know, these fucking hack jobs out there going trying to pin Brian Watt and say, trying"
"7220820","7224600"," to pin Brian Watt and say, oh look, he's wrong again or something stupid like that. "
"7225200","7227040"," And they're consuming his content."
"7228000","7231500"," They're consuming his content because they know he's a better trader than they are."
"7233120","7238260"," They just want, you know, you get these trolls out there and all they really want to do is, you"
"7238260","7241820"," know, they want to pin you on something or they want to say, you know, look what he said. "
"7242140","7244920"," But in the meantime, none of these people make their own predictions."
"7245980","7248680"," You know, none of these people make show their trades."
"7248840","7250700"," These people take a trade live. "
"7250920","7252160"," They don't, they don't do that shit."
"7252760","7253620"," They just don't do it."
"7253840","7255480"," Like none of these people tell you before. "
"7255720","7259840"," Oh, I bought fucking Tesla 1200C expiring on Tuesday."
"7260380","7261500"," They don't tell you that shit."
"7261620","7263440"," They don't tell you I took a spy put. "
"7264260","7268220"," I took a spy 440P right now at fucking 245 in the afternoon."
"7268680","7270260"," I never see that shit on Twitter."
"7270700","7271020"," Ever. "
"7271520","7273860"," It's like, it's like one out of 100 accounts."
"7274720","7281220"," I see someone say, I fucking just took a put on spy right now at this moment in post it."
"7281420","7281520"," Rare. "
"7282280","7287340"," I'll fucking see people drop fucking big old fucking charts with big red bars coming down to"
"7287340","7289040"," fucking 300, you know."
"7289900","7293540"," So, you know, but you don't see people say I'm taking this trade right now."
"7293640","7294220"," I'm taking that trade. "
"7294400","7295780"," Now, Brian, what does that shit all day long?"
"7297140","7299920"," You know, I love that fucking guy."
"7300880","7301700"," Fucking love him."
"7303120","7304520"," Guys taught me how to trade. "
"7305220","7307820"," That fucking guy's got more fucking tools in one finger."
"7314190","7315870"," He's the fucking greatest of all time."
"7318030","7325670"," Yeah, he probably deleted his stuff because he's pissed off. "
"7326130","7327590"," And I don't blame him for being pissed off."
"7327590","7329810"," You know, it takes a lot to make videos."
"7329810","7331830"," It takes a lot to trade while you're making videos. "
"7332390","7334990"," You talk to people like, I talk to you guys."
"7335150","7337790"," I'm trying to take trades and it's not easy."
"7338210","7340290"," You know, I'm not able to focus on what I want to trade. "
"7341530","7346870"," I've taken many more, once I started doing these live, I don't trade nearly as prolifically as I"
"7346870","7347670"," once was."
"7348110","7354010"," I just noticed that this week, like Tuesday or something, I noticed that I'm not trading like I"
"7354010","7354550"," once was."
"7355630","7360970"," I'm making less money than I once was due to my decreased trading. "
"7363250","7367010"," So I think there was a few days this past week where I was trading or last week and this"
"7367010","7372190"," week where I stopped talking in midstream so I can make trades because it's important to me."
"7372810","7374570"," I need to make my money too, right?"
"7376890","7378770"," As a matter of fact, I'm probably going to sign off."
"7378910","7382410"," I'll leave the book map up so you guys can see where you are in Apple. "
"7382410","7384210"," You can see there's a wall of sellers here, right?"
"7385010","7387950"," You can see that where it's just sitting out here on Apple."
"7388450","7390310"," This is like no man's land here, right?"
"7390730","7391970"," This is not where you want to be."
"7392730","7393950"," This is no man's land. "
"7396050","7397970"," Just people want to take profit from above."
"7398770","7399750"," Everybody's happy with ER."
"7401690","7404050"," And the target below is 150. "
"7405090","7408470"," Look at this, the wall of sellers here just waiting to get out, right?"
"7409910","7411050"," Nothing but traffic here."
"7412490","7416370"," And the price target ultimately is 150 for right now on Apple."
"7418550","7420270"," I'm probably going to take a break here for a few minutes. "
"7420390","7420970"," I'll leave the stream up."
"7421050","7422130"," You guys keep talking with each other."
"7422810","7428870"," I'll check back in towards end of day C if we get that squeeze up into the close and I'll"
"7428870","7429970"," be taking a trade at that point. "
"7430230","7436390"," If we get up to 4.4, I'm going to take a trade at 4.40 down in the market"
"7436390","7437610"," into February 18th."
"7437690","7443930"," If you guys don't think we're trading down from 4.40 into February 18th, dude, you got to show me"
"7443930","7444730"," something that I ain't seeing."
"7445310","7449850"," You got to because you got to show me something that says we're going up to 4.70 or 4 "
"7449850","7454870",".80 on February 18th, or it will be at 4.70 with what we know right now. "
"7455470","7460930"," With what we know in the market right now, if you think we're trading up to 4.70, you got"
"7460930","7461530"," to show me something."
"7462530","7468790"," You got to show me that a bank took a $40 million bet on 4.80. If you think we're"
"7468790","7474190"," trading to 4.70, you better be showing me like 4.80. That's on 4.80. That's on 4.90"
"7474190","7482250"," because that's where the absolute gamestrike would need to be just to trade to 4.70. You never"
"7482250","7485710"," actually hit where the wall, there's a wall and there's an absolute gamestrike."
"7486410","7487050"," Two different things. "
"7487050","7492210"," Like where we can trade to is different than where the bets are."
"7493050","7494970"," The outside tail range."
"7496830","7503150"," If you see calls at 500, you'll probably trade to 4.80, 4.90. If you see calls at 4 "
"7503150","7509310",".80, you might trade to 4.70. If you see calls a call wall at say at 4.70 for"
"7509310","7527540"," our absolute gamestrike at 4.70, you might trade to 4.60. I'll"
"7527540","7530120"," try to make a little box down here. "
"7530940","7536940"," I'll put a little box down here that says be back soon or be back at 2.30. Good point."
"7537200","7538860"," Eddie, thanks for bringing that up."
"7542740","7544160"," I'll leave the stream up today. "
"7544640","7545800"," We'll let this load up right here."
"7546220","7547580"," Eddie, I will make that."
"7547900","7553240"," I can make a little image that comes up right here that says be back soon. "
"7553240","7558820"," I'll be back at 2.30 or two o'clock or the next big pivot because I do want you"
"7558820","7561660"," to know if there is a large pivot in the market, I'll always come back on."
"7562040","7562860"," Normally, I do."
"7563000","7567260"," On average, like nine out of ten times, if there's a large pivot in the market and I'm not away"
"7567260","7568180"," from the desk, I will. "
"7568900","7573880"," I still watch the market, but I will come back on and start talking again."
"7575880","7578060"," Do you guys like me on here all day every day?"
"7581560","7582620"," Thanks, and Vasqua."
"7582780","7585200"," I still need those to try those study stats, brother. "
"7586300","7592920"," I had to delete my count with thinkorswim and then get a new one."
"7596000","7598300"," I'm going to reach out to you in Vasqua."
"7603030","7608030"," We're trading just below Vwap right now on Spy. "
"7610510","7611350"," Thanks, Vasqua."
"7614910","7615730"," I'm going to be back."
"7615930","7617210"," I'll be right back or something. "
"7617910","7621190"," I'll leave the stream up always."
"7622810","7624910"," If you guys like the stream every day, I'll put the stream up."
"7625070","7628990"," I'm going to have some interviews to do as well. "
"7629810","7632630"," I've got four people right now lined up."
"7633510","7635910"," I've got some special guests just so you know."
"7639010","7641850"," Do you want to highlight of who's coming on?"
"7648200","7651080"," I've got three people right now. "
"7652320","7654780"," Our first guests, right?"
"7655560","7659320"," We've got volatility wins coming on."
"7666200","7668180"," We've got volatility wins coming on."
"7668180","7672860"," We've got Brian Griffo coming on. "
"7673740","7674820"," He's Tessa Wolf."
"7675740","7677000"," We've Tessa Wolf coming on."
"7677120","7678780"," We've got volatility wins coming on. "
"7679480","7682740"," We've got that Quinn Invest is coming on."
"7683060","7684700"," We've got Joe Donut coming on."
"7685640","7688560"," I'm trying to get Emerson on if I can at some point. "
"7690780","7693000"," We'd like to have Invest gone at some point."
"7693660","7695620"," Haven't asked him yet but want to ask him to come on."
"7696620","7699560"," Yeah, we'll do video interviews a slow trading day. "
"7700420","7701100"," Just chatting."
"7701940","7709060"," Some of the talk might just be some of the talk just might not even be market directly market"
"7709060","7709680"," oriented."
"7710280","7711720"," Try to find out who people are. "
"7712500","7714340"," You know, like who they are as people."
"7715220","7716200"," We've got them in the trading."
"7717020","7718160"," There's stories, right?"
"7719180","7727820"," Sometimes I feel like interviewing on, you guys can always go to other channels to find interviews"
"7727820","7728440"," from people. "
"7729040","7730340"," Or they try to be all technical."
"7731800","7733600"," Which I find boring."
"7735680","7739160"," Sometimes I listen to some interviews and I'm like, man, it's so boring. "
"7740020","7741780"," I just want to talk in the background."
"7742560","7743700"," I was thinking about it."
"7743840","7749960"," I was talking to Tessa Wolf the other night and I said it would be kind of funny to have"
"7749960","7758300"," a channel where when you come into key pivots in the market, you're paying attention to it and"
"7758300","7759040"," you're taking trades. "
"7759720","7763860"," But in the meantime, you're talking to someone about other stuff."
"7764460","7769440"," Maybe it's market oriented or just close to it or maybe the market news we can talk about."
"7775820","7777720"," Yeah, we're going to have a talk about that. "
"7782340","7784180"," Derek Kohno is expecting a short squeeze."
"7785140","7786800"," Okay, so let's talk about a short squeeze."
"7788600","7791420"," Right now we have right now this morning. "
"7792260","7794000"," Yeah, we've had markets to make him on before."
"7794320","7794780"," I love him."
"7794900","7796140"," We'll have him back on as well. "
"7796820","7798160"," Let's talk about a short squeeze."
"7798800","7798980"," Okay."
"7801940","7802400"," Right on. "
"7802520","7802960"," Thank you, Avery."
"7803720","7805000"," So let's talk about a short squeeze."
"7807280","7810020"," So when you short squeeze, right?"
"7811180","7818580"," You've got a short covering rally and then you've got the Vana trade, which is somewhat the short"
"7818580","7818980"," squeeze. "
"7819880","7823520"," You want to see so right now we just right now we just had short covering, right?"
"7824140","7832020"," We just had this short covering and we should have squeezed if a bid came into the market along"
"7832020","7833340"," with that short covering."
"7833340","7835100"," We haven't seen that yet, right?"
"7836900","7844220"," On the 24th, we should have seen a short squeeze that lasted for multiple days."
"7844220","7845620"," We didn't see that right. "
"7847400","7851780"," On FOMC, we should have seen a short squeeze."
"7852060","7855060"," We saw short covering on FOMC."
"7855600","7859820"," We saw short covering on the tag at 420. "
"7860640","7869800"," We saw short covering today, but we have yet to see that Vana trade, which is short squeeze"
"7869800","7877420"," when shorts cover and are squeezed at the same time with a huge inflow of call options."
"7877580","7879580"," So this would be the third day."
"7880600","7883660"," We have not seen the short squeeze. "
"7884400","7887700"," So if I say to you, we'll see a short squeeze."
"7888520","7894680"," And we've just had three excellent dates to have that short squeeze."
"7897140","7898480"," When does it come true?"
"7900660","7904340"," So this would be three dates where we haven't had a short squeeze where we should have had one. "
"7906560","7907760"," We haven't seen it."
"7909240","7913220"," And that is because of the underneath the hood what's going on."
"7914920","7920680"," To imply that we're going to have a short squeeze implies that we're trading to all time highs once"
"7920680","7921060"," again. "
"7930920","7932240"," Yeah, I'd love to have you on investment."
"7933500","7934860"," So think about that."
"7934960","7938460"," I want you guys to think about a bigger picture. "
"7943600","7944120"," Yeah."
"7945300","7946540"," Now we're not on a squeeze."
"7946780","7948500"," We're in a short covering right now. "
"7949060","7950920"," This is called short covering rally."
"7951580","7957300"," There's no difference in what this is than when we melt up slowly, right?"
"7957880","7961860"," It's short covering for us to short squeeze, right?"
"7962260","7968280"," As they cover, you would see a large bid come into the market alongside profit taking."
"7969040","7975380"," Why you guys to be aware of the difference between a short squeeze and short covering?"
"7976040","7978240"," It's profit taking only going on right now. "
"7978980","7980300"," We are not seeing."
"7980380","7988780"," I'm not seeing here any kind of a large block trade bid to the upside to squeeze shorts."
"7989080","7990600"," This looks very orderly. "
"7992420","7998460"," You have to differentiate the two and be able to identify the difference in both."
"8001160","8003820"," It's critical that you identify the difference in both."
"8004580","8011100"," You want to be able to see when the banks step into actually squeeze shorts. "
"8011840","8019660"," You want to see because because banks will say we know that shorts are going to cover today, right?"
"8020240","8021520"," We know shorts are covering."
"8022240","8025420"," So we're going to step in here and squeeze them at the same time."
"8026340","8029180"," And so that's not happening at this moment. "
"8030120","8033980"," It could happen, but you want to look for the signs of it happening."
"8033980","8035320"," We haven't seen those signs yet."
"8040950","8042630"," Yeah, I want to hear Emerson talk. "
"8042970","8045130"," There's a Euroboomer I'd like to interview him."
"8045330","8048190"," There's a few guys on here that I'm interested in."
"8050110","8053850"," Dave, Jason, I'd like to interview Jason if we can. "
"8055890","8057930"," I think he's living right now."
"8057930","8059570"," We were talking about surfing the other day."
"8060770","8062390"," I don't know where he's living right now. "
"8062390","8066970"," He's talking about Arizona and California and stuff like talk to him at some point."
"8067270","8069550"," There's a few of you out there that you guys know who you are."
"8073110","8074650"," What are the goals for the community?"
"8075290","8076550"," Okay, so let's talk about some other stuff. "
"8076710","8077830"," I'm fine with you guys."
"8080350","8082630"," We need to put better rules out there."
"8082970","8085270"," So inside of the discord, right?"
"8086130","8089950"," You guys know the difference between or I guess we have to define the difference. "
"8091050","8095570"," Because we were telling people not to post links or something inside the discord."
"8096550","8101750"," And in reality, I want you guys to post any links that you want to inside the discord, any videos"
"8101750","8103130"," that you want to inside the discord."
"8104110","8106310"," But there has to be a line between. "
"8107450","8108590"," It has to be a line between."
"8109370","8115830"," Like we don't want to be posting Ben Zinga or even if you guys use these things like I"
"8115830","8120490"," don't use a couple others, right?"
"8120650","8122950"," There's where they're just selling shit."
"8123810","8125490"," Like we'll see the two others. "
"8125950","8127250"," There's one that starts with an A."
"8127470","8133550"," There's one that starts with a like Motley Fool would be the other one."
"8136510","8141450"," And this like there's like there's like that guy warrior trading."
"8141750","8143350"," That guy just sells shit, right?"
"8143750","8144690"," He's not really a trader. "
"8145990","8147310"," Like he can't be posting from my god."
"8147310","8151810"," Like I want you posting like videos of people that are just self promoting."
"8152630","8157390"," But if you guys want to post anything that's a democracy of information, like if you guys post"
"8157390","8158750"," stuff from Spockama that's fine. "
"8159390","8165790"," You guys post stuff from some Twitter personality that has a YouTube channel where he talks about"
"8166170","8170870"," options or talks about anything that's giving you information that makes you a better trader and"
"8170870","8172350"," fine with all of that stuff from anybody."
"8173270","8176090"," Any resources that you post from YouTube is fine."
"8177870","8181670"," I forgot the other fucking stupid site is they're like Motley Fool. "
"8181830","8183690"," There's like a couple Motley Fool type sites out there."
"8184030","8185730"," They do articles and stuff."
"8186510","8191570"," I was just talking about one of these the other day or to this morning with Joe Donut, a specific"
"8191570","8193230"," site, those kind of sites. "
"8194350","8198809"," So just self, self work with each other on that."
"8198809","8204870"," Make sure it's just not like a self promotion to self subscriptions to people."
"8205629","8206209"," Right?"
"8206750","8208770"," My, yeah, seeking alpha. "
"8209790","8210969"," That's who it is, Joel."
"8211690","8212889"," Goddamn seeking out."
"8213850","8214870"," I'll beat myself out. "
"8215090","8215290"," Beep."
"8216049","8216670"," No seeking alpha."
"8217350","8219910"," Like I don't want to see Motley Fool and seeking alpha stuff in there. "
"8221129","8222049"," You know what I'm saying?"
"8222770","8224430"," Yeah, the solicitation type stuff."
"8225070","8226910"," You guys know exactly who it is."
"8226910","8229670"," You guys know who I'm talking about. "
"8229770","8232410"," I'm talking about like, I should be more clear with that with people."
"8232770","8238389"," Like, do you guys post stuff from like, I don't know if some trader out there, some, even if"
"8238389","8243950"," they've got a private sub or a paid sub, I'm fine with their stuff from YouTube."
"8244389","8246889"," It's, you know the one, you know the ones that we can't be posting. "
"8249730","8253430"," Anyone out there selling like $1,000 private subscriptions."
"8255370","8259809"," Trying to get you into paying for like, you know, million dollar classes and they only make a video"
"8259809","8260790"," to suck you in."
"8262830","8264790"," There's another guy out there that does that stuff. "
"8265629","8268070"," The guy with the shaved head and the dark shaved hair."
"8268750","8269570"," I forget his name."
"8269709","8275969"," He's like tall and he does like short videos where he doesn't quite tell you about the VIX, but"
"8275969","8276889"," tells you just enough. "
"8277670","8281430"," And then they advertise all over YouTube, like just keep that shit out of the discord."
"8283250","8286910"," So what I want to, what do I, the question was, what I want to see this turn into."
"8287290","8292270"," I want it to turn into a, I want to just turn to a free resource for traders, a community"
"8292670","8294730"," of traders that are happy, right?"
"8294889","8298510"," Trying to help each other, not bitch and widen, not complaining constantly. "
"8299450","8300570"," I don't care if you trade against me."
"8301389","8303190"," I want you guys to be able to help each other out."
"8303770","8304830"," I want it to be a free sub. "
"8306030","8308969"," I want us to be able to trade together, find good entries."
"8308969","8310670"," This is a good entry right here, right?"
"8310790","8315430"," You guys should be looking for some form of a right here in the spa."
"8315570","8317049"," You guys looking for another trade up to 440?"
"8318290","8323129"," If we trade back on this trade here, you're looking for a tag. "
"8325250","8328570"," If you're bearish, we could tag back down below at 430-64."
"8329510","8334610"," If you see one, two, three, one, two, three, set up starting right here, possibly trade up to this"
"8334610","8335670"," 440 before today."
"8335670","8339750"," An expectation, though, is in these situations that we can trade back a little bit here. "
"8340969","8345770"," We could possibly trade back to, because we're still bullish right now."
"8346510","8350969"," But if we do trade back, you'd look for a retest down below at 430, believe it or not."
"8353629","8355570"," We could trade that low from here. "
"8359110","8361209"," We'll see if there's good support here."
"8362250","8365010"," Does it inspire the book map 440 is disappearing?"
"8365389","8365790"," Yes, it is."
"8372719","8374320"," Yeah, 440 is disappearing. "
"8376980","8381000"," The sellers have come down."
"8386549","8388450"," Still a little bit of ice above here."
"8392130","8393970"," Still a little bit of ice up here. "
"8397610","8398870"," We could trade down at 430."
"8401990","8402850"," Another mad dad."
"8402990","8403710"," There's a couple other levels. "
"8403910","8406830"," There's another level here at 430-290 to watch."
"8408090","8409950"," And then a confluence down below."
"8412530","8413510"," Yeah, it's 432. "
"8416970","8419970"," No, 430-340 would be a number to look at."
"8423410","8427730"," And then somewhere down around 430 would be a price target as well."
"8428250","8429490"," You have to see the flow as well. "
"8429670","8430650"," Watch the flow out there."
"8430750","8434110"," Make sure you're watching to see if bears are stepping in right now currently."
"8438190","8441790"," So I posted a link inside of this, the inside of this. "
"8445440","8447620"," Yeah, so what do I see this stuff going?"
"8447620","8453760"," What I want this stuff to become is I want to be able to release a trading classes for people"
"8453760","8458100"," anywhere from like 10 to 30 or maybe start with five to 10 trading classes."
"8458320","8459080"," They're free."
"8459800","8461340"," This is something you'd pay for elsewhere. "
"8461340","8464440"," I wanted to be free and then add more training classes to them."
"8464620","8472680"," I'd like to see alerts be able to post better alerts on Twitter so you guys can get actionable"
"8472680","8473120"," trades."
"8474460","8480560"," I'd like to see if I, if myself or anyone else could make a video once a day, a daily"
"8480560","8482600"," brief that's recorded every night. "
"8483780","8489180"," And then do a live stream that's private at some point inside the discord."
"8491100","8494960"," We're going to take it off YouTube and try to attract people slowly to it."
"8495340","8498640"," We're going to make it semi like you have to find us at some point. "
"8500560","8501600"," There's a bunch of stuff."
"8501720","8502800"," I got a whole bunch of stuff written down."
"8504240","8505240"," But keep it free. "
"8505880","8511120"," That's the key basis behind this and just work off donations and tips."
"8512720","8522520"," If it pays for the time and for the services that I purchase and if it pays for itself, we'll"
"8522520","8523000"," keep it running."
"8524140","8528300"," If it doesn't, then I'll let you guys know. "
"8529000","8531040"," I'll just tell you guys, I'll be honest with you."
"8538810","8539610"," Hey, you're welcome."
"8544320","8546500"," I'll put a link again into the discord real quick. "
"8549180","8550840"," The discord I have to put in the description."
"8551760","8555260"," But for right now, I'll put another link into the chat."
"8556840","8558200"," It is again. "
"8562590","8563530"," There's another link."
"8564330","8565410"," I'll let you guys know."
"8566090","8571290"," Or if I mean at the worst case scenario, if it turns into something where it's on. "
"8572550","8574890"," It's something that we can't maintain."
"8575630","8581310"," I'll just give you guys what my other thought was that I would just post every month."
"8581570","8584070"," What it costs to run the entire thing. "
"8584990","8588590"," And then we'll try to make a goal every month to meet those needs."
"8590130","8595090"," If it comes down to where it's where it's like too much work or I get too bored or some"
"8595090","8600330"," with it or it's impacting my making money or something like that."
"8600710","8602290"," So I'll just always be honest with you guys. "
"8602370","8608030"," You guys will always get just full honesty from me."
"8610570","8611730"," Yeah, and we can leave it."
"8611870","8614670"," If it doesn't work for me, we can still leave it up and running. "
"8615610","8618010"," It's not like we don't we have to close it down or something like that."
"8618410","8619290"," We can scale it back."
"8621710","8624570"," So we're not I'm not constantly on YouTube or something. "
"8624790","8625890"," We can make it work at some point."
"8626030","8627930"," Well, it's a it's a it's a work in progress."
"8627930","8628690"," It just started. "
"8629510","8631130"," So we'll we'll work on it."
"8631370","8632870"," It started with just a daily."
"8633290","8636010"," Yeah, I would just type type up my own due diligence every day. "
"8636210","8638510"," So it's grown into this and it'll become easy."
"8638870","8640530"," It'll become it'll get smoothed out."
"8640770","8641710"," It just takes some time. "
"8643970","8645610"," It's just grown faster than I expected."
"8650730","8652230"," Is the Russ falling right now?"
"8656160","8656660"," That's great."
"8656780","8657940"," I don't have my W.O. Some reason. "
"8658700","8660240"," Yeah, Vix is getting kind of spiky."
"8660340","8662720"," You guys watching the curl they're curling up on the Vix."
"8666930","8669370"," Yeah, the Russell's looking kind of weak right now, isn't it?"
"8674620","8676100"," Yeah, we're going to make it semi private. "
"8676700","8680280"," We're going to make it, you know, you can find us, but you have to hear about us or you"
"8680280","8681500"," have to turn someone on to it."
"8682480","8684180"," It'll be somewhat private."
"8685880","8686200"," To an extent. "
"8688540","8692080"," Are you nuts to think 446 possible end of day?"
"8692540","8697800"," There's probably a 5% chance that you'll see."
"8702530","8703370"," Yeah, I can do that."
"8703450","8704370"," I can do that with a flow channel. "
"8704590","8705750"," I'll put a flow channel up for you."
"8711650","8715650"," I think I can pump a feed with flow in there, to be honest with you guys."
"8716210","8722030"," I think I can post I can post like a flow algo live stream into the discord. "
"8723030","8724550"," That just that just shows it."
"8726470","8729130"," Do I think we can try to 446 possible today?"
"8729430","8735850"," There's a 5% chance that we could short cover squeeze into the last 5 minutes of the day."
"8736510","8741670"," But it's not likely because of the positioning of the market. "
"8742530","8749030"," It's likely that shorts are covering and they're repositioning it once again."
"8751430","8752250"," It's okay."
"8752770","8753730"," We can do this, right?"
"8753730","8758850"," We'll do this for the next three to four weeks until everyone gets comfortable with wearing a bear"
"8758850","8759170"," market. "
"8761670","8762410"," We'll do this."
"8762670","8763630"," We'll go through the motions."
"8764850","8767690"," It's kind of like a relationship, right?"
"8769050","8770710"," You're in a relationship with your buddy. "
"8771770","8774030"," You know what someone's difficult for me is when I was younger guy?"
"8774550","8776790"," All my friends in high school got married."
"8777690","8782130"," And then all my friends in college, they graduated, got a job, and they got married."
"8783250","8785510"," And then I only, you know, I'm not married. "
"8787290","8791030"," And I had to adjust to my friends being married."
"8791030","8792450"," Then my friends had kids."
"8793170","8794390"," I got married later in life. "
"8794390","8795890"," I got married in my late 20s."
"8796890","8797490"," I don't know."
"8797570","8798770"," I was 32 when I got married. "
"8799430","8799770"," Sorry."
"8799950","8800630"," I said late 20s."
"8800710","8801850"," I got married at 31 or 32. "
"8802710","8804410"," But I was later in my group of friends."
"8804770","8806430"," But I had to adjust to them having kids."
"8806430","8816390"," And so we'll adjust to this market where it might take time for us to, you know, change our"
"8816390","8819210"," friendships with the market, change our understanding of the market. "
"8820430","8822850"," It's everything that we've come grown accustomed to."
"8823110","8825130"," Vanna rallies, all these short squeezes, all this kind of stuff."
"8825670","8827670"," We'll get accustomed to this as time moves forward. "
"8830430","8836310"," You're welcome, Jess."
"8838750","8840350"," You're for trying to figure out."
"8842710","8844370"," Yeah, it's like 1%. "
"8845030","8846090"," I'm being generous."
"8846810","8847850"," I'm being generous."
"8848110","8849810"," Is it time for whiskey time already?"
"8851470","8852770"," I am being generous. "
"8852870","8858170"," I'm trying to throw softballs out there to bulls."
"8858490","8863130"," I'm trying to get bulls to like that come to Jesus moments, but they're not."
"8864090","8865810"," You know, they're not going to come to Jesus. "
"8867430","8869010"," When do you take a 440 P?"
"8870230","8872190"," We do it just like you do it as a bull."
"8872750","8874750"," So what do you do in your bull, right?"
"8874910","8875710"," When you come to a bottom."
"8876970","8883650"," You put risk on going up with, you know, like some, you do some in the money, put spreads. "
"8884370","8886510"," You date them out for the next OPEX."
"8887150","8890250"," And then if we start trading down, you get into some weekly puts."
"8890250","8893770"," If we go deeper down, you get into some put FDs, right?"
"8894330","8896070"," And you lay on more and more risk. "
"8897650","8898770"," But just in the opposite."
"8901830","8903550"," Just in the opposite side of stuff."
"8907260","8908680"," That's some shots up in here. "
"8909180","8911540"," Yeah, let me take a break and I'll leave you guys to this."
"8911960","8913640"," You guys got my targets for below, right?"
"8913780","8918720"," You got a target here somewhere around 433 and change."
"8921020","8924120"," Another target and a confluence down here like 432. "
"8924840","8927340"," And then ultimately it wouldn't surprise you to see us trade on a 430."
"8928520","8932340"," We might, we might get some get some support in here."
"8933700","8934340"," It's possible. "
"8936120","8939880"," Some by the deeper step in, but pay attention to the flow as it comes in."
"8940260","8943160"," I know I want you to know that day traders like me."
"8945520","8949660"," Want to see it trade down to, you know, between 430 and 433. "
"8950500","8953000"," And then see it get picked up for a rip into clothes."
"8953660","8956940"," Or we just sell straight down into the clothes, depending on where the VIX is."
"8957260","8959000"," The VIX is curling up pretty well here, right?"
"8960120","8964980"," It's curling back over a little bit, but this is looking like it's basing for a move higher. "
"8965840","8970320"," So I'm going to expect some capitulation down into the three or four o'clock hour."
"8970320","8971480"," And then a rip higher."
"8973740","8976700"," I didn't ban, I didn't ban anybody, just anybody knows. "
"8978460","8980480"," You got banned yesterday, it happened, he has missed."
"8980960","8982960"," How do we ban Diesel?"
"8984460","8985620"," I didn't know that I banned Diesel."
"8986840","8987640"," How do I unban him?"
"8990820","8991800"," I can unban him. "
"8993080","8993760"," Who is he?"
"8994860","8995980"," Is he banned from YouTube?"
"8996780","8997780"," Or is he banned from the Discord?"
"9003540","9005720"," Yeah, let me know how to unban him."
"9010730","9011930"," I didn't know that he was banned."
"9013430","9013830"," Okay. "
"9014310","9015030"," Yeah, I think so."
"9015210","9016150"," You know what I think of what it was?"
"9016330","9017210"," Was I think it was me."
"9017950","9019690"," So it wasn't tell your wife's boyfriend. "
"9020230","9023970"," I've been, I've haven't given clear instructions to people."
"9025730","9029210"," And I, so I gave, I gave your wife."
"9029430","9033610"," So the other, I want to apologize to, let me apologize to. "
"9037050","9040610"," We had some earlier this week."
"9041450","9043610"," We had, I pulled out the ban hammer."
"9044310","9047150"," And I asked your wife's boyfriend to pull out the ban hammer. "
"9047370","9048830"," So we might have been a little too heavy."
"9049810","9050110"," In the banning."
"9050650","9053370"," And that's ultimately my responsibility and my fault. "
"9053950","9055770"," So I will unban Diesel."
"9057550","9058070"," Yeah."
"9058670","9059210"," No, I've got no. "
"9060750","9061270"," Yep."
"9061590","9062030"," That was me."
"9062030","9064990"," I was aggressive in the background. "
"9065250","9069330"," It had more to do with, that's my fault."
"9070310","9076750"," I didn't pick anybody specifically, but I was the one that told your wife's boyfriend to get the"
"9076750","9077410"," ban hammer out."
"9078290","9079570"," So that's not his fault. "
"9082010","9083310"," That's ultimately me."
"9084090","9085790"," I was trying to quell some."
"9088210","9089550"," Take it the elevator down. "
"9092170","9100270"," So I will talk to your wife's boyfriend and I'll talk to any of those guys that have been banned"
"9100270","9101390"," will unban immediately."
"9102850","9105450"," It's probably poor communication from my side."
"9106210","9108310"," I need to do a better job of communicating. "
"9111850","9113430"," What or how we."
"9114890","9116250"," What I'm looking for."
"9119250","9120810"," It had more to do. "
"9121050","9122350"," It had more to do with."
"9123910","9125250"," You guys know who it had to do."
"9125330","9126330"," It didn't have any of these guys. "
"9127490","9127910"," Yeah."
"9128330","9129510"," No, no worries."
"9129690","9130110"," I'll fix it. "
"9130910","9131630"," I apologize."
"9133030","9134410"," Well, yeah, he may."
"9135260","9137410"," It stems back from. "
"9137970","9141550"," There was two things going on in the live stream."
"9142410","9143350"," That."
"9144130","9146290"," Can be poisonous to. "
"9148450","9150310"," View market viewpoint."
"9152710","9157490"," Where you just get over overly bullish and overly bearish and."
"9158490","9160610"," I can impact how people trade. "
"9160610","9163450"," Yeah, no, I don't want to lose anybody."
"9166690","9169250"," I don't want to lose any members of the community at all."
"9169390","9169830"," Not nobody. "
"9171230","9172670"," So I'll tell you it's my responsibility."
"9174950","9177230"," So I'll make a personal apology to him as well."
"9177910","9179710"," And I'll find out what's going on and I'll take care of it. "
"9182990","9183310"," What?"
"9185490","9187430"," They got arrested for child abuse."
"9189170","9189790"," Hold on."
"9190010","9191950"," So what I'll do is I'll talk to your wife's boyfriend. "
"9193010","9193890"," That was me."
"9194290","9198150"," Because I wanted to put the ban hammer on and had more to do with."
"9199170","9205730"," Sometimes subs and not subs, but it didn't wasn't happening in my knowledge in discord, but on the"
"9205730","9206290"," YouTube channel. "
"9207070","9208870"," Now you people can get real restless, right?"
"9208870","9214970"," They get very emotional in their trading and they come in and they want to create strife or"
"9214970","9215230"," whatever."
"9215730","9218310"," And so you just got to time people out cool them down a little bit."
"9219430","9220870"," You don't want to be using the ban hammer. "
"9221070","9224330"," You just want to be, you know, well, some people love not some people."
"9224590","9231710"," I specifically told your wife's boyfriend to break out the ban hammer three days ago."
"9231830","9236330"," I should have called my boyfriend back and said, okay, we've done what we supposed to have done. "
"9236850","9238150"," That's my, that's my fault."
"9239430","9240870"," I apologize directly."
"9244630","9246650"," Yeah, no, I've got all I've got you. "
"9247190","9248370"," Hold on."
"9249590","9250530"," Eat some water."
"9252470","9253510"," I didn't know that. "
"9253670","9255030"," So I'm all over it."
"9264560","9266440"," You've got March calls for 71."
"9269890","9271030"," Let me think about that. "
"9277000","9278120"," I'm all over it."
"9278120","9285140"," Avery, I promise I will unban Diesel and I'll even apologize publicly to him when I unban him."
"9285460","9288140"," So I'll hop in there and I'll unban him right away. "
"9290740","9293300"," Yeah, tapering of banning."
"9293600","9294240"," Yeah, absolutely."
"9294840","9295380"," I'm going to go to lunch. "
"9296280","9297500"," Let me take a break and I'll be back."
"9300260","9301400"," You guys are hilarious."
"9302420","9310380"," If you do see Diesel out there, can you please extend my hand?"
"9310380","9310720"," Yeah, I'll be back. "
"9314260","9318740"," We need a place to share scanners for Thinkorswim."
"9318860","9319920"," Is there a place you can create?"
"9320480","9323380"," Diesel wanted yesterday that he would be willing to share for one, which is appreciated."
"9323900","9325520"," Yeah, I can make a channel for that stuff you guys want. "
"9325680","9329980"," I'll make a channel for Thinkorswim scripts."
"9331340","9332300"," Any kind of scripts."
"9332960","9333320"," Thinkorswim. "
"9333420","9334760"," I've got a bunch of scripts too, by the way."
"9335240","9336620"," I've got scripts for like trading view."
"9336620","9338700"," A bunch of dope ass shit that I wrote myself. "
"9338940","9341900"," I've got a bunch of shit that has been given to me over time."
"9342300","9344620"," I'll make a flow channel, a script channel."
"9353540","9354120"," You know what?"
"9354220","9355680"," Well, let's work on that today too. "
"9355860","9358540"," So I'll meet you guys today at some point at four o'clock."
"9358540","9364820"," Anyone that wants to be a mod or to admin inside of the discord or it needs more."
"9365060","9368360"," I think I can give moderators the ability to create channels. "
"9368360","9371540"," So we'll get in there today at four o'clock."
"9371940","9372920"," I know free diesel."
"9374400","9376500"," I'll check Twitter DMs today too. "
"9378980","9380120"," Guys are killing me."
"9381140","9382800"," I'll check Twitter DMs today."
"9386360","9389920"," You got kicked from the gold group for posting a discord mod meme. "
"9390640","9391140"," What?"
"9392920","9393660"," All right."
"9393900","9396000"," So I'm going to I'll I'm all over this stuff."
"9397500","9399480"," And I'll meet you guys in there today. "
"9399720","9402800"," Let's try to have a talk or a meeting about getting some mods."
"9403280","9403500"," Yeah."
"9410010","9411170"," Usually, right?"
"9411970","9412450"," Usually. "
"9414810","9416890"," It's usually should just be a conversation."
"9419110","9420930"," My private conversation, right?"
"9423210","9424610"," Just chill out relax or whatever."
"9424610","9430870"," Now we did have a follower earlier in the week that didn't understand that. "
"9431910","9436590"," And so I broke up the ban hammer and I handed it to somebody to use."
"9437270","9442750"," So I will change my stance on that."
"9444290","9445170"," Check my PayPal. "
"9445630","9446710"," Did I get some tipage today?"
"9447870","9448790"," Somebody tip me?"
"9449350","9451790"," I'm going to go through to anyone that donated today as well."
"9451790","9455510"," If you donated it or if you are going to support the stream, we're going to go through and get"
"9455510","9456710"," some shout outs today as well."
"9457190","9457910"," Because it is Friday. "
"9458610","9460590"," We'll have a whiskey together today because it's Friday."
"9461190","9463070"," And we'll start getting you some of you guys ramped up."
"9464950","9467410"," Yeah, we'll unbend five members yesterday. "
"9471410","9471810"," Yes."
"9472550","9473290"," I will get."
"9474470","9476470"," I will fix all of these things today. "
"9476470","9477050"," I'm on it."
"9477830","9485470"," Before end of day today, before like four or five p.m. right now, I'm going to post one inside"
"9485470","9486890"," the chat once more."
"9488970","9494050"," And if you are banned, I'll get the man or hammer out and I'll issue a public apology to every"
"9494050","9494930"," member at this point. "
"9495230","9496370"," It's ultimately my responsibility."
"9496930","9497870"," I think I might have."
"9498310","9501470"," I might have been not clear enough. "
"9504170","9505850"," So I just posted in the chat."
"9509600","9512420"," Someone got banned docs and then are we not connected?"
"9517440","9519200"," Are we connected or not connected?"
"9522400","9524440"," It looks like I had a drop signal again."
"9525380","9527480"," I think I just had a drop signal once more. "
"9527940","9530160"," You might have dropped the signal on the stream here briefly."
"9536490","9537190"," Thanks, mess."
"9537910","9538110"," Yeah. "
"9538430","9539330"," So hey, mess."
"9541510","9544910"," I don't get so the ones that come through on the."
"9546470","9547070"," It's weird. "
"9547230","9547410"," I get."
"9547690","9550210"," I get donations in two, two ways."
"9551130","9552970"," I get one donation path. "
"9553890","9554850"," I see them immediately."
"9555490","9556570"," The other donation path."
"9556750","9557670"," I don't see them until Wednesday. "
"9558510","9559190"," Or not Wednesday."
"9559530","9561190"," I don't see them until Fridays."
"9561790","9564350"," So I come on every Friday and I'll talk to all you guys out there specifically. "
"9565370","9568230"," So I'll be giving you guys shout outs today around three o'clock."
"9574810","9576750"," I'm damaged on bands for the rest of the year."
"9578350","9582930"," Yeah, no, normally typically when all it needs to be is it needs to be. "
"9583970","9588890"," Just a side conversation, you know, be cool or, you know, whatever."
"9589330","9590810"," Not even muted or anything like that."
"9590970","9591890"," Just needs to be a side conversation. "
"9591930","9592930"," Just talk to somebody."
"9593870","9597710"," And then you don't really break out the band hammer unless there's like gross abuse."
"9598950","9601870"," And then even then there's a whole bunch of shit. "
"9602510","9606430"," I need to be more clear about and just make sure that everybody's aware."
"9607390","9609650"," It's not you guys know, you guys know in your own."
"9609910","9612350"," You guys should be able to self moderate most instances. "
"9612990","9614290"," You should be able to self moderate."
"9615030","9621210"," I don't care if you guys even even are I don't even care if you're if you're like, Hey, you"
"9621210","9622830"," know, Kat made the run call today."
"9622970","9624230"," I don't care about any of that shit. "
"9625090","9630970"," The only thing that I do care about is when I've care about two or three major things."
"9631330","9636770"," Like I don't want anything that's really derogatory towards people for their religious backgrounds,"
"9637290","9638430"," color, their skin."
"9639390","9641070"," You know what I'm talking about that shit. "
"9641150","9642530"," I'm talking about their sexual orientation."
"9643630","9647750"," I've got no I've got zero tolerance for any of that kind of stuff because you I don't care what"
"9647750","9651170"," you do in your regular life out on Main Street, but we're here to make money."
"9651710","9654130"," So we have to have your we're here to make money hat on. "
"9654570","9658350"," And then the only second thing that I care about is brigading."
"9658610","9662930"," So if we're going to brigade at any point where if you're frustrated or pissed off, that's fine."
"9662930","9664950"," If a trade didn't go your way, that's fine. "
"9665610","9674270"," But if you start to brigade the sub or the the YouTube channel or discord, then that's an issue."
"9677430","9682550"," Other than that, though, I don't care if you just like, you know, Kat, Kat miss the call."
"9682690","9682970"," He sucks. "
"9683510","9684030"," That's fine."
"9685090","9688750"," You know, I don't care about any like lighthearted making fun of me, that kind of stuff."
"9689250","9691030"," I just don't like the brigading stuff, right?"
"9691330","9692790"," So as long as you don't become that, that's cool. "
"9692970","9693470"," I'm cool with that."
"9693970","9701110"," I had to pull the ban hammer out earlier this week because there was a moment of absolute dummy."
"9701210","9701890"," I don't even want to say it. "
"9702570","9703650"," Just pure stupidity."
"9704530","9706410"," And it wound up affecting the entire stream."
"9707150","9708070"," It bothered me deeply. "
"9708550","9712470"," It gave me like the parent somebody saying I'm short of 480."
"9712810","9713810"," I'm still short right now."
"9714330","9714830"," Blue my mind. "
"9715370","9721850"," Like I've never once told anyone ever and never would tell you to do anything crazy like that."
"9722370","9723050"," Pure insanity."
"9727290","9728290"," Yeah, I'll take care of it. "
"9730730","9731830"," I'll free the five."
"9733850","9734670"," I'll free the five."
"9734770","9735690"," Oh, Marlin said that. "
"9737650","9738850"," Yeah, I'm all over you, white boyfriend."
"9739110","9739490"," I got your brother."
"9739890","9740650"," I'll give you a call right now. "
"9741270","9741490"," Yeah."
"9741870","9748590"," And just to be clear, anything that your wife's boyfriend has done is all upon me because I'm the"
"9748590","9750670"," one that's saying, break out the ban hammer."
"9751510","9753110"," So I'm just not being clear enough. "
"9754230","9759570"," So if any mods are doing anything right now, it's typically because I've fucked up."
"9761510","9762110"," All right."
"9762630","9763770"," So I'll talk to you guys soon. "
"9763950","9765710"," I'm going to take a quick break and I'll get right back to you."
"9766030","9767190"," I'll leave the stream on, of course."
"9767850","9769410"," Your price target is still in a day 440. "
"9770370","9773590"," I don't know if we see 446 or 446."
"9774170","9776270"," That would take some kind of an irrational move higher."
"9777190","9779430"," You have a steady supply of sellers here. "
"9779430","9779650"," OK."
"9780050","9782430"," Well, you guys, to see that you have a steady supply of sellers here."
"9784050","9785910"," I think the safe trade is up to 440. "
"9787050","9791910"," I think that if we do trade to 446 as someone was asking, it's possible."
"9792690","9794170"," I don't think it's a safe trade though."
"9794750","9798950"," You know, so if you guys can trade it up to 446, you guys can trade to 470 if you"
"9798950","9799150"," want. "
"9800050","9809690"," But the risk for me when I put it into the market this morning looked like that."
"9809690","9809810"," That's right."
"9809890","9811030"," I think the safety is in that trade. "
"9811350","9815790"," Now it can change if you start to see more flow continue into end of day."
"9815870","9817610"," We trade higher to 450, 446."
"9818410","9819170"," Stay with the trade. "
"9820270","9821770"," We want to match the flow to it."
"9821770","9823670"," Make sure that the flow is matched up as we trade higher."
"9830780","9832020"," And I'll talk to you guys a bit. "
"12015080","12016860"," So this posted a quick chart on."
"12019940","12020460"," Captain's Alpha."
"12021220","12023640"," If you're getting bullish here. "
"12024260","12026600"," I'm looking for that next step up there to 440."
"12028560","12031780"," You'll see if you do check that post on that captain's alpha."
"12032260","12035700"," You'll see the yellow and the blue and the white line and the green line there. "
"12036080","12037840"," This is just areas of support below."
"12039000","12041640"," In case there is a failure where to grab to go higher."
"12046520","12050020"," The mixed bag right now of calls and put flow coming in. "
"12050360","12051840"," All retail traders right now."
"12053420","12057840"," But still looking for that 440 C or that 440 price target above."
"12071640","12072040"," Sweet. "
"12072260","12072680"," It didn't."
"12073220","12073620"," My."
"12074320","12077160"," It's kind of cool to see that my camera didn't freeze today. "
"12077800","12079360"," We're having problems with camera freeze."
"12080560","12081780"," It looks like I'm back on."
"12082380","12085400"," You guys let me know in the chat if you can see me waving my hand at you. "
"12091200","12091880"," Yeah, whatever."
"12093480","12094200"," Yeah, of course."
"12095160","12096040"," Give me a hug. "
"12097200","12098240"," Hi."
"12107190","12108030"," Right there."
"12109430","12110630"," All right. "
"12110850","12113910"," Back to school."
"12114990","12115670"," Around."
"12116650","12117370"," Give it to me. "
"12118190","12119310"," Thank you very much."
"12121830","12123170"," Thank you."
"12127470","12129630"," All right. "
"12131390","12133410"," Yeah, you guys saw one of my daughters there."
"12133550","12134530"," There's another one over there."
"12134570","12135830"," Another intern was behind her. "
"12140830","12141630"," Two interns."
"12148290","12148690"," Babes."
"12149530","12151770"," They run my life and let the boss of anything. "
"12152650","12155490"," Y'all think I'm the boss of anything out there?"
"12155630","12155850"," You crazy."
"12162540","12163100"," Apple."
"12163100","12167120"," Yeah, I think there was I think they've been pumping that whole apple could buy pellets on right. "
"12180460","12181580"," 24th, 23rd."
"12183720","12185160"," I'll go through all these."
"12192360","12193480"," All right. "
"12193480","12193700"," Later."
"12194020","12196340"," Those are the free interns."
"12198780","12201160"," Oh, right on and happy birthday to your daughter, Jess. "
"12204880","12205520"," All right."
"12205640","12206780"," What's that line above there?"
"12207220","12209180"," This one right here or this."
"12209560","12212860"," This white line that's this white line right here is VWAP. "
"12215980","12216500"," Yeah."
"12216580","12217380"," Congratulations, Jess."
"12217560","12225020"," Happy birthday to your daughter. "
"12225020","12228180"," I had a video on Reddit and it had a young child."
"12228980","12232860"," And I was that made me think of my daughters when they were that age."
"12233960","12237260"," And they like, like the superhero on their life. "
"12241080","12242560"," Take the kids to work."
"12242860","12243200"," Like a box."
"12245300","12246440"," Yeah, I've got two daughters. "
"12247480","12247880"," They're getting older."
"12249580","12249820"," I'm sad."
"12250060","12252300"," I wish I had like 10 babies, I'll be honest with you. "
"12252300","12257520"," I never wanted kids and we had our first child."
"12259220","12260140"," And that was it."
"12260460","12262020"," We definitely wanted another one. "
"12262520","12264380"," Now that we have two, I wish we had more."
"12265960","12267760"," They've been like the best thing in the entire world."
"12272100","12273320"," It's sellers just snap down. "
"12273500","12275000"," Yeah, it looks like you're going to see some sellers here."
"12275660","12276320"," Get some large sellers."
"12276880","12279480"," These balls, the big ones, the red, big red ones. "
"12281140","12283020"," See the big green balls pushing us up."
"12283140","12285200"," You see a couple of nice red balls here."
"12285740","12286880"," A seller is leaning in. "
"12287280","12288520"," We're sitting red on VWAP."
"12289840","12293700"," A little bit of consolidation to see if we want to take this higher."
"12303020","12304780"," Price target above is definitely still 440. "
"12305700","12306880"," There's a lot of traffic here too."
"12307320","12309840"," You can see these sellers set a white line come down right here."
"12310480","12311260"," That's called the ice. "
"12312640","12314560"," There's resistance to the move up to 440."
"12314560","12316700"," It does seem a little early in the day."
"12317520","12318300"," It is only. "
"12318640","12321520"," It is only two for one."
"12321760","12323600"," I try to consider the time to."
"12324640","12325560"," You can trap. "
"12326280","12327880"," Sometimes it'll happen here."
"12329000","12332120"," It'll look like it's very bullish to make a move higher."
"12332920","12337620"," In reality, it's a trap for bulls for a move higher later. "
"12339020","12340680"," So you get bulls to buy here."
"12342760","12348120"," This doesn't always happen, but oftentimes you'll see consolidation here."
"12348400","12349560"," You'll take a long position here. "
"12350280","12352480"," You'll have to have first resistance point."
"12352980","12353900"," You'll enter again."
"12355860","12357040"," Then it'll trade down. "
"12358600","12364160"," It'll force you to either capitulate or enter again or average down to make that next leg up."
"12365160","12367520"," To get that actual push to 440."
"12374690","12376510"," Someone was asking, can we go to 446?"
"12377470","12379090"," You'd want to see 440 right now. "
"12379430","12385530"," If you want to see 446, you're going to need to see 440 in the next ten minutes."
"12388490","12390690"," You'd want to see consolidation at 440."
"12391850","12396370"," Maybe a small pullback down to 436 and that rip up to 446. "
"12396890","12398290"," You want to see the power in that move."
"12400450","12403230"," But typically this is a trap, not really a big trap or anything."
"12403330","12405370"," It's just a matter of consolidation. "
"12407150","12410310"," The will of the bulls want to move it up into the 440."
"12417910","12419350"," You'll see that quick pullback."
"12420030","12427370"," It's not the three bar rule, but it's usually the bears will try to push it down once, twice. "
"12428270","12430070"," They'll make a third attempt to push it down."
"12431330","12437270"," Sometimes that pushes the stock price down briefly to the real grab to go higher."
"12438390","12445930"," And then depending on how bullish it is, sometimes that third tap can be right at where we are"
"12445930","12449050"," right now or it's slightly lower. "
"12462830","12470110"," Now if you want to learn, not learn, you might know this, but this specific trade right here where"
"12470110","12470810"," we're looking at."
"12472890","12475650"," Personally, I miss grabbing them."
"12475690","12480510"," I might miss four of them where it'll just fail. "
"12480690","12480990"," All right."
"12481790","12488850"," Or it moves higher and I didn't grab the third rip higher because it was so strong, but I always"
"12488850","12495290"," wait for the third test below, two tests below where we currently are."
"12496230","12500730"," That way, they almost always work, right?"
"12501070","12503290"," Because if it fails and really fails, I missed it. "
"12504590","12510830"," And if it goes lower, I get the best entry, but I will sometimes miss the trade higher."
"12511330","12516190"," So sometimes you're missing the trade higher, but you're not missing it if there's a deeper"
"12516190","12517790"," pullback or a failure."
"12517790","12520990"," So this setup specifically is great. "
"12521230","12530930"," This is a bullish setup, but oftentimes you'll get a slightly deep pullback or a failure."
"12533310","12534490"," So I'll show it to you."
"12534770","12537430"," You'll do this move right here. "
"12538770","12545850"," You'll trade lower and then away rip higher or you'll dip lower and then it'll fail."
"12547410","12549190"," So I always wait for down here first."
"12549730","12552850"," Now, every once in a while, though, it does rip higher and I missed that trade. "
"12553290","12561170"," But the caveat is that it'll make a false move higher oftentimes then dip down and I'll be"
"12561170","12562610"," positioned wrong."
"12563430","12567170"," Or it does that false move higher, trades down and it fails."
"12568190","12575730"," So for me personally, just my own trading, how I trade, I will look for this move up. "
"12575730","12576990"," We'll show it right now real quick."
"12582470","12589010"," So yeah, we came above, right, resistance, bounce, bounce, right, start moving up."
"12589890","12592730"," You're looking for that third attempt by the Bears to knock it down. "
"12593170","12594370"," You can see the right balls right now."
"12594610","12595630"," One, two, three, four."
"12596550","12600830"," This will be that last chance of the Bears to push this down. "
"12601610","12602650"," It usually shows a little bit of weakness."
"12603690","12606990"," At least not every time, but oftentimes enough, it will show a little bit of weakness."
"12606990","12610170"," If you swing down, then you make a nice, nice, fat move higher. "
"12612450","12614290"," Sometimes I miss them, I'll be honest with you."
"12615310","12616990"," I'll wait for a deeper pullback."
"12617650","12619030"," The last little pullback I'll wait for. "
"12620810","12623710"," Now, it's more about risk than are we going up from here."
"12625750","12626830"," There's more about positioning."
"12628470","12629950"," So I'll trade this with you. "
"12632210","12634830"," I mean, you guys can be in this trade right now still."
"12635150","12639950"," I'm going to look for a slight pullback down and see if we can take it higher."
"12646850","12647890"," Nice little pullback. "
"12648130","12651090"," One, two, I'm going to look for one more dip down here."
"12653670","12657190"," Then I'll ride this up with you to 440 into the bell."
"12662280","12665080"," I'm going to look for a little bit of a deeper pullback here at some point. "
"12665080","12667120"," It'll look like it's going up, then it should fail."
"12667740","12670600"," Not fail, but pullback deeply, and then we'll ride it up."
"12672600","12673980"," Now, there's another note on this. "
"12674060","12674900"," It'll be the time of day."
"12675060","12675280"," It's 158."
"12676840","12678380"," You can see the attempt to move higher. "
"12679020","12682720"," We can actually trade down heavily into the three o'clock hour, then we rip up into the close."
"12683340","12686580"," I mean another option as well."
"12687660","12688600"," But these are classic setups. "
"12689280","12690580"," Now you guys have seen these a bunch."
"12690580","12695880"," If you start trading the spy, you'll see these setups frequently."
"12705240","12706380"," There isn't really a rule. "
"12706820","12711260"," There isn't really a rule."
"12713680","12719440"," There's usually, so these are patterns that day traders look for."
"12723240","12724520"," Then you'll see the mark. "
"12725260","12728640"," This is in specific stocks and ETFs, specifically."
"12730270","12732100"," You'll see these setups in the spy."
"12733300","12735320"," You'll see other setups. "
"12736040","12742620"," One of my favorite setups is bullish wedges in Apple."
"12743220","12749940"," Like when I trade Apple on the intraday, it's always this tighter and tighter and tighter squeeze"
"12749940","12751200"," that takes place on Apple."
"12752080","12753620"," So Apple trades its own way. "
"12754060","12755200"," Tesla does the same thing."
"12755720","12759740"," Not the same as spy or Apple, but they have their own trading pattern as well."
"12762580","12767420"," You usually see a 70 to 90 point move up and then a pullback for two or three days. "
"12768260","12770340"," You can usually follow a trend line in Tesla as well."
"12771540","12772860"," When it's bullish and when it's bearish."
"12773960","12776020"," You just ride that trend all the way up and all the way down. "
"12779580","12783730"," They don't always work, but a lot of the heavily traded stocks and ETFs."
"12784480","12788680"," There are setups that all traders are looking for, bulls and bears."
"12791900","12793160"," Now that happened frequently. "
"12802800","12804140"," This is all iced in here."
"12804940","12808100"," All this light blue that you see is a lot of ice in the bottom and on the top."
"12810760","12815260"," Looking at you find buyers are already stepping in here on the spy. "
"12817860","12821140"," There is a by program kicking in here indicators nice and purple."
"12825270","12829630"," It'd be interesting to see if it fails right now too briefly or if it actually does go up."
"12830790","12833290"," Because it'll be a good example of, hey, you missed one. "
"12834830","12838290"," Or you were right waiting for the pullback or failure."
"12846170","12848050"," And how I look for the failure."
"12848470","12853610"," If there is a pullback and if I'm looking for the failure or just a pullback to go higher. "
"12855750","12858930"," It's going to look for flow at the same time."
"12859010","12860450"," I'm looking for options flow."
"12860950","12865450"," Are the bulls stepping in on that dip or are the bears leading in hard and heavy?"
"12876000","12881900"," You guys saw one of my daughters. "
"12882480","12883380"," Rule of thumb though."
"12883780","12884440"," And there's a bunch of."
"12884540","12888660"," So these are all I'll do some setups with you guys one day with just like a we'll go on"
"12888660","12888860"," to. "
"12889980","12890820"," We'll go on to."
"12893300","12898060"," Trading view and we can do intraday setups and show what they look like."
"12901710","12906790"," There was an easy setup at the open this morning for for bottom on the spy right off the bell. "
"12906790","12908330"," It was a classic move."
"12909550","12911150"," That trade down and then trading higher."
"12916130","12918510"," And how to see if it was going to fail this morning. "
"12922040","12923520"," Actually, you actually just look."
"12924760","12928000"," And you can if you just look on a one day chart on the spy."
"12929080","12930700"," There was a hint that we were going up. "
"12931460","12936440"," If you see the first two taps down below and then we rose a nice beautiful top."
"12937980","12939920"," Showed that bulls wanted it to go up."
"12939920","12946060"," If you saw a little if you saw like side or you saw some really tight sideways. "
"12947100","12949420"," Without that big nice crown in that W there."
"12950020","12952640"," That top on the around 10 20 this morning."
"12952880","12957300"," Have that been much lower and just kind of trading sideways you'd expect it to fail. "
"12958600","12961440"," Seeing that nice push up this morning around 10 18."
"12962700","12964380"," Implies that the bulls are trying to make a move."
"12967820","12969060"," Implies that shorts to covering. "
"12971200","12972820"," Say put that nice push up here."
"12974060","12974760"," Take profit."
"12975660","12980180"," Look for a nice dip down here into the two o'clock maybe the three o'clock hour. "
"12980840","12982600"," And then nice run up to 440 in the close."
"12983160","12985500"," Now if we see like huge heavy put flow come in."
"12986200","12987660"," We'll know that the bulls gave it up. "
"12988440","12990020"," And we should be able to see at some point."
"13001860","13005620"," And Omar's I know this is another thing that Omar's talking about here."
"13006100","13008380"," Which is another thing that I typically do when I'm day trading. "
"13008800","13011200"," As I usually keep an options chain open."
"13012240","13014180"," And we've talked about this before right."
"13014440","13017340"," So Omar just mentioned that 440 calls are back at 45 cents. "
"13017520","13018180"," So here's a good point."
"13018700","13019480"," Let's say this morning."
"13020240","13024620"," 440 is started at 45 cents right that it started the day there. "
"13025060","13026240"," We know it's a zero day."
"13026240","13029340"," We know they're going to burn the intrinsic value of that call."
"13029560","13030380"," Wherever is left of it. "
"13031320","13035820"," So you'd more than likely see the bottom price of that option."
"13035820","13038260"," If we're bullish this works bearish as well."
"13038900","13042320"," But you'd see that option go from like 45 cents up to a dollar. "
"13042440","13043560"," Let's say or $2 or $3."
"13044980","13048860"," I think the 440 is up to $3 at some point."
"13049240","13053700"," But they'll come back to 45 and then they'll like come back to 40 cents or 32 cents. "
"13053700","13055440"," Then it'll go up to like $2 or $3."
"13055860","13057380"," Then it'll go down to like 15 cents."
"13057960","13058820"," It'll go up to like a dollar. "
"13059560","13065820"," And so you just want to watch the admin flow of an option."
"13067080","13069060"," Because then you know when people got in originally."
"13069940","13074320"," And you know that they ultimately want them to pay only zero at the end of the day. "
"13078490","13081590"," So I'll watch if I'm interested in a specific ticker."
"13081590","13087650"," Or if I also watch the options chains for where the algo switch to sometimes they'll start the day"
"13087650","13087750"," off."
"13087910","13091290"," Let's say 440 and then they move over to 335s. "
"13091730","13093970"," 435s let's say in contextually to this."
"13096090","13098030"," So good in and out in and out."
"13098950","13101310"," Pumping it all day long or selling it all day long. "
"13107450","13108390"," One of my favorites."
"13108650","13108830"," Hey, Mary."
"13108950","13109210"," How are you?"
"13109570","13113710"," One of my favorite places to watch options chains right now is tasty trade. "
"13114790","13116570"," It's simple and it's quick."
"13117330","13120210"," And they show the algo switching back and forth."
"13122930","13126950"," It's one of the most for tasty being such a piece of shit platform. "
"13128390","13130570"," I use the web browser."
"13131210","13132170"," I'll use the desktop."
"13132450","13133610"," I use the web browser. "
"13134330","13135070"," Keep it up on a screener."
"13136110","13137510"," I'll keep the screener open."
"13137510","13142230"," And I just watch the chain all day long as I'm day trading. "
"13142790","13143510"," I keep us."
"13143830","13149230"," I've got right now I've got one screener with nine charts open."
"13150770","13154990"," I have another screener open with a full candlestick chart. "
"13155210","13157870"," I have another screener open with heat and bar book map on it."
"13158270","13159850"," I have another screener open with flow algo."
"13160750","13164470"," And then typically I have another screener with the options chain. "
"13164610","13165710"," Right now I'm flipping back and forth."
"13167430","13171570"," I'm running so much right now that I usually have anywhere from five to six screens going."
"13172150","13177250"," But because of the computating power with book map and all this and the streaming, I can only run"
"13177250","13178670"," five square. "
"13178830","13181410"," I want two, three, four, five screens going right now."
"13182010","13183630"," But one of them is a."
"13184670","13190890"," Now I have one of these screens running as a monitor for the broadcast."
"13192390","13194570"," I'm like trying to add stuff into my. "
"13195070","13197110"," I was just trading by myself before."
"13201170","13203850"," And now I'm adding all this other stuff into it."
"13203930","13204890"," I can't. "
"13205890","13207230"," I'm trying to buy."
"13207950","13209710"," And another computer, a big one."
"13210390","13210770"," Like a server. "
"13213170","13215050"," So that I can run everything on a server."
"13215470","13218950"," I can keep book map going for days and month weeks."
"13218950","13221570"," I want to talk to you guys about some real quick as we sell down here briefly. "
"13223810","13226190"," So I want to talk to you guys as we sell down."
"13226290","13227350"," Unless you're in a short right here."
"13233620","13235740"," I see some bears stepping in right now briefly. "
"13236420","13239100"," Day traders got dang trig day traders."
"13242300","13245920"," It's kind of funny too because this setup is so common, right?"
"13246680","13249980"," The bears know they can take a quick jump in right here to knock it down."
"13250540","13254760"," And bull day traders know it's coming down or expected to come down. "
"13256220","13261220"," And so it's almost like you've got to dance right between day traders knowing that we're going to"
"13261220","13261840"," knock it down."
"13262120","13263320"," And then we're going to ride it back up."
"13263800","13266500"," There will be a point where bears will get spooked in this trade. "
"13267700","13269700"," And bears will step in and try to take it higher."
"13271380","13272800"," Very, very common setup."
"13280480","13281760"," Oh, hey, your wife's boyfriend. "
"13282320","13283260"," My phone was dead."
"13285160","13285880"," My phone."
"13286240","13287240"," My phone died. "
"13289360","13290920"," I have it on the charger right now."
"13297820","13300620"," All right, so we're going to talk about some real quick."
"13300880","13301880"," I'm going to bring something up. "
"13302220","13302900"," I'm going to post."
"13303200","13308420"," I don't know if I can post it in the feed or be making posts in the chat."
"13310800","13312720"," Well, I'm going to bring something up here real quick. "
"13318010","13319550"," We just a second here."
"13322310","13324870"," Just a second in display alert box."
"13324950","13325630"," I don't have that. "
"13329240","13330700"," I thought I had this on here."
"13330880","13332120"," Okay, we're just going to do it on."
"13340960","13342700"," I might end up clogging the feet up here. "
"13342880","13345420"," I want you guys to on your own free time."
"13346280","13366040"," I want you guys to spy camera."
"13368460","13369200"," YouTube. "
"13373970","13381320"," I want you guys to on your own time."
"13381500","13389060"," I want you to go to the spy camera website or the spy camera YouTube channel."
"13389600","13393140"," I want you to do it today over the weekend before Sunday. "
"13395420","13398360"," You have to put aside an hour and a half, I think."
"13399720","13401120"," This didn't get any views."
"13403140","13406960"," I think it had like 400 views when it was live the other day. "
"13408960","13411780"," You might have got up to a couple thousand at this point."
"13411920","13412680"," Okay, so right here."
"13414200","13416800"," Now it's only got 4.9,000 views. "
"13417280","13420520"," It's a criminal that this hasn't been watched."
"13421220","13421580"," It's criminal."
"13424120","13425420"," And do yourself a favor. "
"13426260","13427200"," How long is the live stream?"
"13427840","13429700"," It's an hour and a half or something hour and ten minutes."
"13429960","13431480"," Even if you have to break away from this stream."
"13432740","13436140"," I feel like the only chance chance to have to watch this is right now. "
"13436840","13439680"," I'm going to go out all weekend and have a blast."
"13440380","13443080"," I would even recommend that you just cut off my stream."
"13444420","13446980"," And you just watch this stream right here from this weekend. "
"13448180","13449120"," Oh, no, is this yesterday?"
"13449400","13449780"," It came out."
"13452560","13454580"," And see how."
"13456360","13461460"," How spot camera is talking about why we haven't had Vana trades. "
"13465380","13467340"," Why we haven't had our Vana rallies."
"13468400","13472260"," Someone was asking earlier about, I guess Derek Code-Noi was saying that we're going to get a Vana"
"13472260","13472440"," rally."
"13473820","13477380"," Well, they're talking here why we haven't had a Vana rally. "
"13479720","13484200"," And they talk about why we shouldn't get a Vana rally."
"13484320","13487160"," And if we are going to get one, what to look for if we do get a Vana rally."
"13487740","13488940"," Rather than just short covering. "
"13490460","13492640"," And they talk about the year in here."
"13493240","13500080"," So part of my talk this Sunday will be will include portions of this video."
"13503460","13504000"," From. "
"13505340","13506300"," From this weekend."
"13507540","13509700"," From the thirty two ends and SG."
"13515400","13518060"," I didn't know that Sam BC is pumping the bear market thesis. "
"13520680","13522040"," But I do why you guys to."
"13523080","13524820"," Yeah, Derek still is a bad ass."
"13526720","13527540"," He's a bad ass. "
"13528980","13529740"," I love him."
"13529920","13531720"," He's to be an old school football player too."
"13533820","13535560"," But you should watch you should watch that video. "
"13535960","13537560"," If you haven't watched it right, you should."
"13538380","13541460"," You should if you're asking me when should I sell Tesla."
"13542800","13547340"," Or when should I when should I sell Tesla when should I sell my Apple position when should I sell"
"13547340","13548320"," my QQ Q position. "
"13551280","13554800"," Or you want to know more information as to where we really are in the market."
"13555120","13557920"," And they made a really good point in that live cast."
"13558980","13559660"," Which was. "
"13560720","13563520"," We know we trade day in and day out."
"13564220","13568280"," In the other day, as a matter of fact, the other day in the discord, someone was mentioning someone"
"13568280","13568640"," mentioned."
"13571720","13575260"," How would the difference in price between. "
"13576960","13580020"," Or we're talking about getting the flow for SPX."
"13580480","13582120"," How underlying stocks can."
"13583260","13585580"," Impact the spy before it happens by a few minutes. "
"13586160","13589660"," Then you also have real price to always hear people and talk about real price."
"13590040","13591740"," It'll come out the real price to come out and spy."
"13593440","13594720"," So you're talking about. "
"13595560","13596520"," Sometimes the trader."
"13596800","13598640"," You get caught to the day trader."
"13599040","13601680"," You get caught and say why isn't this working right now. "
"13601920","13605480"," It's because you weren't paying attention to other aspects of the market."
"13605680","13605740"," Right."
"13605940","13606500"," You got Vixpiration. "
"13607060","13608220"," You've got OPEC."
"13608520","13608860"," You've got."
"13611600","13614060"," Rolling contracts rolling in different dates. "
"13614800","13615680"," Different times."
"13617960","13618960"," That kind of stuff."
"13619240","13620820"," And Darius makes the point of. "
"13622160","13624580"," That you have to even as a trader."
"13625240","13627620"," Sometimes you got caught in something and not realize it."
"13628700","13631200"," And it'll become apparent after the fact. "
"13631800","13633240"," You say man, I'm so stupid."
"13633380","13634500"," How did I not know that was happening."
"13635800","13637020"," And Darius's point is. "
"13637860","13638940"," Even as a day trader."
"13641540","13644100"," You have to be aware of your macro environment."
"13646820","13648640"," And key moments and key parts. "
"13648640","13650860"," You don't have to be the smart guy."
"13651380","13652340"," You don't have to be."
"13652540","13653720"," I don't mean like the smart trader. "
"13654520","13656180"," But you know, oftentimes in the market."
"13657300","13658760"," There's a lot of noise."
"13661360","13664840"," By people that want to sound smart. "
"13666280","13670920"," For different reasons that you don't realize as a follower in social media."
"13671160","13673900"," Oftentimes you'll see like a new Twitter handle come out."
"13674400","13677360"," And you'll see people use big words. "
"13677860","13680840"," And they'll posit theories and all this kind of stuff."
"13682520","13685320"," And it's more for them to believe it or not get an internship."
"13686420","13688620"," Or to start a newsletter that they can charge for. "
"13689200","13690400"," You know, it's like a side hustle forum."
"13691160","13692840"," Or it's for them to get into graduate school."
"13693320","13693800"," You don't know that. "
"13694420","13696420"," I know some of you probably don't even know that."
"13697060","13699040"," So, but we're paying attention to it."
"13699080","13700660"," And we're trying to trade with that information. "
"13702220","13703840"," Or use these grand thesis is."
"13704000","13708200"," But you have to understand the motivation behind some of the people that talk on Twitter"
"13708200","13708920"," specifically."
"13710720","13712340"," What their motivation is in the background. "
"13716380","13719660"," And some people are just there because they're having a bored day of work, right?"
"13719880","13720420"," This is what they do."
"13721000","13722820"," But they're not actually traders or investors or whatever."
"13723720","13727880"," So Darius is good because you can get a macro viewpoint in the market. "
"13727880","13733700"," And it does imply what's going to happen in the market over the course of the year."
"13734560","13736140"," And there's some good good target dates."
"13736460","13740480"," As a matter of fact, who was it?"
"13742700","13746880"," I think there's a chart. "
"13747660","13751380"," I don't know who had the chart, but there's a chart that shows where the expected rate hikes are"
"13751380","13751740"," this year."
"13752580","13754440"," I think like November is a rate hike."
"13756100","13757420"," It got pushed out from December. "
"13757760","13758520"," There's a rate hike in March."
"13759160","13761660"," There's some like anticipated rate hikes."
"13761820","13762780"," I'll get that chart for you. "
"13763000","13766980"," I found a chart someone made this week and that showed where we expect rate hikes this year."
"13767980","13774560"," So you can like just mark an encounter where to expect the most volatile parts of this market this"
"13774560","13774880"," year."
"13775740","13777900"," And Darius does some of that same stuff. "
"13778140","13782700"," He'll do a macro view for you to look at as a day trader and an investor."
"13783320","13788880"," If you're a long-term investor, you'd be thinking about a guy like that, helping you along when you"
"13788880","13789940"," should be buying stocks."
"13790780","13797360"," Then just as a trader, you can make notes on a calendar with a spy chart for the year and"
"13797360","13804140"," say to yourself, I have to pay attention to where we are right now in the stock price, where it"
"13804140","13808380"," can trade up to, where it can trade down to with these known events that are going to take place"
"13808380","13809400"," throughout the course of the year. "
"13811160","13816320"," Now volatility traders as well are going to be looking for the major known volatility events in the"
"13816320","13816940"," course of a year."
"13818840","13819260"," Right?"
"13819260","13821200"," Markdown, we've got an election cycle coming up."
"13821200","13824840"," You markdown that we think we know where the rate hikes are coming. "
"13826100","13829940"," Even if they don't happen, we know that there'll be volatility into those events."
"13830960","13835800"," You can kind of start thinking about where we should be trading to and where we trade down in those"
"13835800","13836880"," events for the rest of the year."
"13844190","13846230"," Yeah, you know, someone was making a..."
"13850300","13853860"," Yeah, so all I want you to do right now is if you guys have a chance, I want you"
"13853860","13855920"," to go to the SpotGama YouTube channel. "
"13856520","13859760"," And the most recent video was a live stream from yesterday, I guess."
"13861180","13864740"," It's about an hour and 50 minutes or something or an hour and 15 minutes."
"13865460","13868860"," Do not miss that video. "
"13868860","13877880"," It is critical to all of you and your viewpoints on where this marketing market is heading for the"
"13877880","13878520"," rest of the year."
"13880900","13887920"," No, I'll get that chart for you showing the anticipated rate hike dates or which months we're going"
"13887920","13888720"," to rate hike this year."
"13890180","13891600"," You just plot them out for yourself. "
"13891760","13893060"," You keep yourself a notebook, a ledger."
"13893460","13897340"," You can just do a vertical bar and you put a little, type in a little note on a spy"
"13897340","13898200"," or an ES chart."
"13899000","13904240"," You just post them for the rest of the year and say, you know, anticipating a rate hike on March"
"13904240","13906100"," FOMC. "
"13906580","13911460"," I'm expecting a November FOMC rate hike."
"13912120","13913520"," And you can even just chart in there."
"13913680","13918720"," You can do your classic traditional charting for the year and know that we've got these note events"
"13918720","13919100"," coming. "
"13923600","13925620"," I can zoom out and spy absolutely."
"13927000","13930740"," Yeah, I don't even know if I recommend trading the people or even investing right now until you"
"13930740","13931440"," watch that video."
"13932320","13933140"," I'll be honest with you. "
"13934880","13939660"," If there was a moment for you to take a break in this market, it's right now."
"13946020","13955200"," It's right now to take a break of this market, turn off CNBC, turn off Twitter, and"
"13955200","13958780"," seriously watch that video."
"13959980","13965800"," Get the information from those guys and then start going down the rabbit hole and that stuff,"
"13965960","13966020"," right?"
"13966220","13969380"," You can pause and start that video 20 times probably. "
"13969980","13973880"," Pull down some of the charts they put through up there and then go down the rabbit hole and that"
"13973880","13974160"," stuff."
"13980620","13983460"," We didn't have that 410 down there before."
"13985040","13989300"," Watching some heavy flow of the bears come in right now, spy puts, tassel puts. "
"13996600","13998260"," But I behoove you to watch that video."
"13998360","13999360"," It's important to watch."
"14000860","14002680"," Because that is one thing you need to know. "
"14003500","14006380"," You hear people spouse stuff on Twitter."
"14007040","14008000"," It's like two kinds, right?"
"14008160","14013140"," You get the ultra bear that just shows you the chart with spy just crashing."
"14013980","14015580"," Yeah, that's cute and fun or whatever. "
"14017220","14020560"," But then you get people on Twitter that there might be bond guys."
"14020760","14023740"," Oftentimes there's like bond guys, you're not really understanding what they're saying."
"14024260","14029320"," Oftentimes it's someone that's in the financial world that they're not traders, they're not"
"14029320","14029700"," investors. "
"14030900","14035740"," They just need to keep and maintain a Twitter presence or social media presence anywhere."
"14037980","14043180"," But a guy like Darius, he's geared towards the macro investor."
"14043980","14051040"," You know, the investor that's looking for a long term viewpoint on the market. "
"14059140","14066180"," Looks like we've got a trap buyer situation from the consolidation of the past three hours."
"14070380","14074120"," DJ and 40 points down since you mentioned waiting for a pullback."
"14077340","14078940"," So that's my point is. "
"14080220","14084320"," You guys want to watch that video before the end of the first Saturday."
"14085260","14090040"," I would take a walk to go watch that video before you decide what you think you should do."
"14092380","14096080"," It's interesting because a lot of the talking points that spot gamma made. "
"14097140","14102280"," There's a lot of the same talking points that we've been talking about on this channel for the past"
"14102280","14102760"," couple of weeks."
"14103700","14109900"," And in even spot cameras, they were talking about putting a day as a one day and a five day"
"14109900","14112180"," forward looking dot plot."
"14113060","14117560"," That spot camera puts out and even the guy for spot gamma was like, look, he's like, I don't"
"14117560","14120960"," normally put the one month as one month out because it can change so fast. "
"14122200","14123400"," The dot plot changes."
"14123800","14126780"," He said we consider putting one out, but he's, he's right."
"14127000","14132180"," Like, yeah, you, you, you, you'd like take the spot gamma stuff and it's awesome. "
"14132660","14138260"," But at the same time, you have to in your own be able to see the implication of what takes"
"14138260","14139560"," place in the course of a day."
"14140280","14142400"," They can have massive implications on that stuff."
"14143520","14145360"," And you can't blame spot gamma for that. "
"14145360","14149860"," You know, spot camera is giving you information and then you see a hundred million dollars in spy"
"14149860","14150840"," puts coming down to 400."
"14152220","14156720"," That kind of blows out anything spot camera said, what doesn't blow it out, but you have to apply"
"14156720","14159940"," that to what he's given you for information."
"14161620","14164420"," It's able to complement all these tools together. "
"14165660","14166980"," What's really going to happen."
"14168280","14173200"," And then even if someone's saying we're going to have a Vanna rally out there, I guess other people"
"14173200","14174280"," are saying we're going to have a Vanna rally."
"14175080","14178440"," This spot camera's asking this guy, why are we not getting the Vanna rally?"
"14178440","14186460"," There's a fair point to ask because normally under normal circumstances, we should have had one on"
"14186460","14186880"," OpEx. "
"14187280","14189780"," We should have had one on FOMC."
"14190580","14193660"," We should have had one when we had 420 three times now."
"14194440","14196760"," Three times for three good reasons. "
"14197540","14198440"," And here's a fourth reason."
"14200460","14202220"," Tesla had overall good."
"14202440","14203720"," If this was any other time, right?"
"14204180","14205500"," Tesla would not have sold off. "
"14206800","14207800"," Any other time."
"14208580","14209260"," Think about that."
"14209500","14214360"," If Tesla had traded down into that earnings last year or the year before, it would have been a"
"14214360","14214760"," moonshot. "
"14215920","14216720"," Hands down."
"14219480","14221040"," And Apple had great earnings."
"14222160","14223500"," Apple had outstanding earnings. "
"14223500","14229200"," That Apple earnings call yesterday should have triggered a Vanna rally."
"14229200","14235040"," It has been so many moments the past two weeks where we should trigger a Vanna rally."
"14236240","14239340"," And so that video addressed a lot of that stuff. "
"14240360","14241640"," It's seen a nice bounce."
"14242920","14247580"," The 433, but that's interesting down here, right?"
"14248900","14258720"," I saw some Tesla put flow here just"
"14258720","14259220"," for today."
"14259920","14261580"," It's literally it's it's for today. "
"14261840","14265900"," January 28th, Tesla, 810 P for $200,000."
"14267720","14270560"," Some call flow in Tesla today, 850."
"14272780","14276280"," January 28th, $90,000 on the call side. "
"14277800","14279080"," Just all day traders."
"14279400","14282160"," This is all day traders and boiler rooms."
"14282160","14283340"," That's what it is. "
"14286720","14288200"," IWM puts coming in right now."
"14288280","14291400"," January 28th, $191 P, $230,000."
"14296020","14298860"," Some dip buyers still low down below here at this 432. "
"14299200","14301500"," It looks like there was a little step in here."
"14301740","14303740"," They might have moved higher to grab this dip right here."
"14304740","14306760"," I don't think this might be the dip we're looking for. "
"14307220","14310880"," Might still be around 430 or so."
"14320300","14326100"," You want to be looking where you want to be looking where not only do they sell down in Q4,"
"14326220","14328420"," but you want to be looking for where they're trading, right?"
"14328880","14329660"," Are they trading high?"
"14329880","14330460"," Are they trading low?"
"14331240","14333480"," We had a pretty decent sell down, I thought, in Tesla."
"14335500","14337480"," We tested we traded down in Tesla. "
"14338620","14340500"," What 300 points or some, right?"
"14341900","14344760"," You trade down the 25% into an ER."
"14345400","14352880"," You shouldn't, on a good ER, be trading then down another 10, 20% in a bull market."
"14354860","14357900"," Not in a bull market when we just tested a low at 420. "
"14360320","14365620"," You start to layer all this stuff in, like your layer and all in right."
"14365800","14366680"," So we just traded down."
"14366840","14369360"," You're going to remember, you can't take this stuff all on its own. "
"14369360","14372880"," Like you can't have Tesla trading down from 1250."
"14374720","14377480"," Like put the pieces together here, right?"
"14377660","14379000"," You got Tesla 1250."
"14380880","14382400"," Just traded down, right?"
"14383600","14389500"," We couldn't go into their earnings release and you see profit taking, right?"
"14390000","14392760"," Trades up for a little bit and then boom, heavy profit taking. "
"14393400","14396360"," We are though in the markets at a bottom, right?"
"14396360","14399320"," If you're a bull, your thesis should be."
"14400300","14403660"," Hey, we just traded down to freaking four fucking 20."
"14404700","14408360"," So you start to see all these kick ass earnings calls, right?"
"14408520","14411520"," We're seeing a kick ass earnings call pretty much in Tesla. "
"14412160","14414180"," You've seen a wonderful earnings call in Apple."
"14414460","14424270"," Both are saying, we expect growth this year and you're telling me we're not going to"
"14424270","14425110"," catch a Vanna rally."
"14425890","14428410"," We have all the news out on FOMC. "
"14428410","14429970"," We have OPEC's ended."
"14430510","14436670"," So you start to add all these things up and you start to wonder, you know, do you have to"
"14436670","14439170"," have a sell off to 400 before you say, oh, you were right?"
"14439850","14441410"," Or do you really just start?"
"14442010","14444490"," As a trader, you have to put some stuff together."
"14444730","14447650"," You have to take the facts. "
"14448430","14452190"," You know, in 2020 to 2021, we're saying what I'm saying."
"14452350","14455330"," I'm buying this dip and I had people say to me, are you crazy?"
"14455890","14457070"," That's all they had to offer."
"14457530","14458110"," Are you crazy?"
"14458950","14460830"," But it wasn't all I had to offer. "
"14461070","14464670"," I had done my due diligence why we should bounce and move higher."
"14465410","14468710"," I had the facts as to why we should have that Vanna trade."
"14469130","14471050"," And this is the same just on the inverse. "
"14472090","14478010"," You start to add these things up and say to yourself, okay, so I'm looking for a Vanna trade,"
"14478350","14479870"," right?"
"14480910","14482410"," I'm looking for a Vanna trade."
"14482410","14486370"," Is there anything out there that's going to lend other than a sure covering trade?"
"14486590","14490150"," Is there anything that's going to lend itself to us to us getting a Vanna trade?"
"14490230","14491790"," I'm looking for huge call flow."
"14492210","14498890"," I'm looking for AMC for looking or markets being forward looking with FMC being out of the way. "
"14499230","14503110"," El PEX is out of the way looking for some big calls coming in."
"14503110","14509070"," I'm looking for, you know, all this all this good news and we're not getting that trade."
"14510150","14514470"," So if we're not getting that trade, it's not lending itself to us getting that trade. "
"14517250","14519710"," And that's a lot of what that video is about."
"14521250","14523470"," Is, you know, Spock was asking that question."
"14524250","14526330"," We should get this and we're not getting it. "
"14526910","14527250"," Why?"
"14530390","14532670"," And Darius is laying out why."
"14538120","14539400"," Oh, they are holding it."
"14539400","14541700"," You can, I can promise you they're holding it. "
"14542400","14546040"," You can go right into, you can go right into the options chain, right?"
"14547680","14551540"," And they, the bears are, it's not even bears."
"14551800","14553320"," I don't think it's bears."
"14554300","14556280"," I think it's, it's bulls. "
"14557800","14567620"," I think the one mistake this time is that people are like literal bulls are hedging this market."
"14569640","14571280"," Even if they're still long in stock."
"14571580","14573320"," I mean, you see the dip buyers still showing up. "
"14574320","14580080"," But at the same time, right, bulls have never put on protection like they have."
"14582740","14588720"," Bulls of, bulls of only at moments they'll, they'll protect themselves at moments."
"14589800","14592780"," But they haven't removed their protection right now in this market. "
"14594740","14597340"," Bulls have said, I might lose my investment."
"14598960","14600620"," And it might come back still."
"14600820","14603060"," So I'm going to stay in my investment and I'm going to hedge. "
"14603080","14604340"," I'm not taking that hedge off."
"14604940","14606280"," And so I know the coast is clear."
"14607180","14608500"," Now I don't care what it cost me. "
"14610140","14611440"," So they haven't cast them in."
"14611920","14614520"," And there's, it's more than likely they're going to keep adding."
"14616100","14621780"," And what's crazier is if we are like a magnet to all those puts out there and we do begin"
"14621780","14622640"," to trade down. "
"14622640","14630020"," To lower and lower levels that they will eventually capitulate and go balls deep in even more puts."
"14630480","14635020"," And that's where that actually introduces some kind of 30% correction by end of year."
"14635320","14636600"," That takes some time to play out. "
"14637300","14639980"," But you should watch that video because they lay it out."
"14640140","14641640"," Chris declare and."
"14644260","14650460"," Spock, I wouldn't have done that video if it wasn't important to at least have some kind of an"
"14650460","14651060"," idea. "
"14651060","14655060"," Of what's going on in the engine of the market."
"14671790","14672650"," Here, look at this."
"14672670","14674330"," There's some support down here at 430. "
"14674850","14675830"," They came up right here."
"14676330","14678390"," And now they're sitting here trying to take this trade higher."
"14680250","14681010"," We'll find out. "
"14681290","14686790"," I'm looking for, before I take a long here, I'm looking to see if a big flow comes in from"
"14686790","14687070"," the bulls."
"14687530","14688290"," I'm not seeing it yet."
"14697120","14698260"," Yep, second order Greek. "
"14708180","14709960"," We trade outside of the standard deviations."
"14711700","14717280"," So when you get squeezed each level and you get squeezed higher and higher on a short covering."
"14719780","14722620"," Some banks step in and know that they can squeeze people higher. "
"14722800","14723980"," They're not doing it right now today."
"14723980","14729940"," And you're not seeing people close out their puts."
"14731120","14732520"," Which means that these put buyers. "
"14734640","14735500"," Are scared."
"14739520","14743360"," They're taking on these puts on large positions."
"14746060","14749860"," If I if I own a hundred million dollars in in Tesla. "
"14753580","14757900"," So I'm going to buy, you know, a hundred thousand dollars, three hundred thousand dollars."
"14758680","14760080"," I own a billion dollars in Tesla."
"14760400","14763800"," So I'm going to take a hundred million dollars and puts on the spy. "
"14772290","14773770"," I watched that video this weekend."
"14774290","14775270"," Don't miss that video."
"14776630","14778850"," And if you know any bulls or bears. "
"14779150","14782050"," If you know anybody out there that thinks for getting the van at trade, they should watch that"
"14782050","14782330"," video."
"14784830","14785890"," Right to the end."
"14786730","14787950"," Watch the entire thing. "
"14788450","14789650"," Be patient with the video."
"14800180","14803720"," Because they do take a minute to dumb it down for everybody to understand."
"14812740","14816720"," Brent Brent's like takes it takes moments to explain what's going on. "
"14817160","14818840"," There's a few things in there that get complicated."
"14820220","14821700"," But they put up charts."
"14822140","14824120"," You can screen or screenshot it. "
"14824220","14825440"," You snip it."
"14825440","14826100"," Download it."
"14826940","14828440"," And then blow it up on your screen. "
"14828820","14830360"," Look at what he's showing you for numbers."
"14831700","14833200"," And then ask questions on Twitter."
"14833480","14834860"," If you don't know what they're talking about. "
"14835080","14839040"," Just put a post on Twitter and say we're in the discord and say what does he mean by this."
"14840000","14841520"," And what does he mean by that."
"14843840","14850980"," You should make a great discussion for Twitter or you should do is post that video in the discord"
"14850980","14852840"," for everybody to watch. "
"14852840","14854800"," It's critical that people watch that video."
"14856480","14858640"," It's going to be part of the foundation."
"14860280","14863100"," Of what we discussed this weekend on Sunday. "
"14863700","14866360"," And if you guys know that information going into the Sunday discussion."
"14866940","14869040"," It makes it easier for us all to be safe."
"14869040","14869720"," Same page. "
"14869960","14870960"," At least to entertain it."
"14879210","14880830"," I close my longs."
"14881130","14883850"," When we hit four twenty I close my longs into that day. "
"14884990","14885930"," Into that Friday."
"14886810","14888810"," They wound up closing my long enough Friday."
"14889190","14889630"," Whatever. "
"14889930","14890710"," It was the twenty fifth."
"14891410","14892550"," Is that Monday or is that Friday?"
"14892650","14892970"," I forget."
"14893850","14894290"," Yeah. "
"14894370","14894890"," It was Tuesday."
"14895390","14896630"," Seems like it was two weeks ago."
"14896770","14898070"," That's how long ago it felt like. "
"14898890","14899190"," But."
"14902430","14903730"," I didn't feel right."
"14903850","14905250"," It didn't feel like a van or alley. "
"14905610","14906230"," And it wasn't."
"14907630","14910390"," We know now that it wasn't a van or alley."
"14911490","14912070"," Right. "
"14912210","14912870"," Hindsight trading."
"14916960","14919000"," Seems like a pretty decent support here."
"14920400","14922200"," Fools are putting up some kind of a fight. "
"14925280","14926380"," I'm going to wait though."
"14934080","14934660"," Yeah."
"14934740","14936100"," The bottom is far from result. "
"14937160","14939020"," I got very I got very bearish."
"14939780","14940780"," Past couple days."
"14941820","14942400"," Again. "
"14943440","14944180"," Very bearish."
"14947670","14948250"," Yeah."
"14948250","14949050"," Currency's are good. "
"14949310","14949710"," Hey, Quinn."
"14954390","14956270"," They just said that more rate hikes."
"14956270","14957530"," Yeah, we're getting more rate hikes. "
"14958150","14959730"," Well, you know, well, I don't know."
"14959850","14961090"," So there's two parts to this."
"14962630","14964990"," Depending on how far off we trade this year. "
"14966050","14968670"," Depending upon when the capitulation moments are."
"14969570","14971190"," You could see no rates."
"14972490","14974710"," But that would imply that we're in a recession. "
"14976230","14977430"," Because it's weird."
"14977870","14979490"," You'll see like it's really bizarre."
"14979490","14983450"," You'll see like how the Fed reacts can be too late. "
"14986090","14988950"," There's a lot of moving parts in that answer."
"14989790","14990450"," Good to see you, Quinn."
"14992730","14995190"," Quinn, you know, and in that video, Quinn. "
"14996190","15002630"," The drawdown in Bitcoin is expected at 78%, 80% or so."
"15004930","15005870"," In that video."
"15007270","15008650"," Even more than equities. "
"15009590","15015930"," I think it's 70% or 80% is the expected drawdown in Bitcoin in that video."
"15029720","15030240"," Hold on."
"15030340","15031700"," Where you ask and I miss you, Omar. "
"15033320","15036320"," Is that new support on?"
"15037960","15039240"," I don't know yet."
"15039400","15041340"," I'm still waiting for options."
"15041640","15042340"," Slow to back it up. "
"15043240","15044160"," Before I take along here."
"15044160","15048020"," I want to see some confirmation."
"15051370","15057950"," There's a new new buyers down below at 432.07. That's another point lower. "
"15060370","15061730"," We get closer for you."
"15068680","15069600"," Right in here."
"15070420","15071020"," It's like a magnet. "
"15073040","15087520"," 432.08. Yeah,"
"15087620","15088680"," it has to do with it."
"15088680","15095260"," What it has to do with is they're correlating it with the equities drawdown over the year."
"15098920","15108740"," And it has nothing to do with all the other shit that's talked"
"15108740","15111520"," about negatively about Bitcoin or crypto. "
"15114060","15116360"," It's just market macro market dynamics."
"15120610","15121930"," It was for 12 today."
"15125330","15127330"," Yeah, he's got it at 80%. "
"15127330","15128710"," I think it's 80%."
"15131990","15136970"," You're going to look for a buy-in at 432.08. If we can get it down there."
"15142130","15144090"," We'll see if the buyers step in down there. "
"15152110","15157630"," Yeah, so watch the video."
"15157950","15165610"," I implore you to watch the most recent video by Spock Amma."
"15165830","15170110"," And I would implore, if any of you guys know Derek Code Noy out there, maybe send that video his"
"15170110","15171930"," way so he can see it. "
"15173150","15174090"," I like that guy a lot."
"15174290","15175330"," I respect everything that he does."
"15178230","15181270"," Make sure he gets a link to that video as well. "
"15182470","15188770"," Because it's a nice little reaction there."
"15190330","15190990"," Nice reaction."
"15192410","15193710"," So you see this right here?"
"15195730","15199970"," Someone was able to get at 432.25. Someone was able to make a buy right here. "
"15201590","15202810"," 432.30 they got."
"15209980","15211100"," How fast that is."
"15217790","15218730"," Yeah, it's good homework. "
"15221980","15222980"," Same for me, Eric."
"15223440","15224080"," That's what I did."
"15224660","15229980"," Derek, I used to own Bitcoin like whole coins for dollars. "
"15235660","15237100"," And I've lost some coins."
"15238680","15239820"," Yeah, Derek's a great bear."
"15239820","15244440"," If you guys see him out there, make sure he gets a link to that video and tell him to"
"15244440","15244880"," watch it. "
"15246120","15247500"," It's an important video to watch."
"15250120","15253740"," Because I'm telling you, I don't know how many subscribers Spock Amma has."
"15254560","15261540"," But I know that a ton of Spock Amma has been waiting for that Vanna Rally for the past couple"
"15261540","15261800"," weeks. "
"15262880","15265000"," It's just been stacking up why we should get one."
"15265640","15270520"," So I think initially as a bull, you're saying, well, we've had all these events and we've had all"
"15270520","15272900"," these reasons have a Vanna Rally."
"15273060","15273820"," We haven't had one yet. "
"15273820","15274700"," Why haven't we had one?"
"15275820","15276720"," You can't call."
"15278180","15278800"," I'm sorry."
"15278980","15281580"," You can't call the bounce off 420 of anorally. "
"15282420","15283500"," That's not a Vanna Rally."
"15284140","15286120"," We've been making those moves the whole past week."
"15287220","15287580"," Shit. "
"15287840","15290940"," Some days this week, we've been making them double up and down."
"15298250","15299130"," Short covering."
"15303120","15304420"," That's what this is right here. "
"15321680","15327440"," Now the question becomes, you might get one more bounce in here."
"15329240","15339440"," Price target above is 436.96. Could be a rejection though at 435.28. Make notes at 425.28. Make"
"15339440","15341160"," another note at 437."
"15342400","15346360"," Flat or 436.89. Next target above is 440. "
"15356390","15375680"," Your VWAP is 435.38. I"
"15375680","15377680"," didn't know that they had an open day for their content."
"15378520","15379900"," Was it just yesterday?"
"15382240","15384060"," I wish I had caught that yesterday."
"15384420","15385900"," I think they were talking about it yesterday. "
"15385900","15391260"," I want to see Tesla go up."
"15391400","15392180"," I agree with you on that."
"15393340","15394960"," Nice support there in 432. "
"15395320","15396200"," It's a nice trade higher."
"15401990","15405990"," Yeah, so VWAP can be, you can adjust your VWAP."
"15407910","15408830"," And deviations. "
"15409270","15411010"," Then you can also adjust just the numbers, though."
"15411130","15411950"," The raw base numbers."
"15413070","15414990"," So yours are probably just different than this one. "
"15419870","15421430"," It's on YouTube hedge-eye."
"15421710","15422110"," What's it called?"
"15422270","15422630"," Hedge-eye?"
"15423370","15424210"," I'll look that up."
"15430770","15433210"," Yeah, I've been good to have seen that content yesterday. "
"15433390","15434630"," I wish I had, but I was able to see it."
"15443540","15443980"," Oh, yeah."
"15444240","15445060"," I like the macro show. "
"15445260","15446240"," I've seen the macro show before."
"15455440","15457320"," You guys are supposed to get rocked, aren't you?"
"15458240","15458840"," With snow?"
"15463020","15464580"," Talk about a time to go skiing."
"15464580","15472220"," If you could get some snow like dumping up in Maine, like Sugarloaf, Sunday River, or Burke"
"15472220","15476820"," Mountain, Jay's Peak up in Vermont, like Jay Peak in Burke Mountain, probably my favorite place is"
"15476820","15477380"," Tuskegee. "
"15478400","15480540"," I like Tuskegee and Tuckermann's too."
"15482900","15483880"," I've skied everywhere."
"15484720","15487860"," Not everywhere, but I've skied almost the entire country. "
"15488820","15494180"," Not everywhere, but for most skiers, I've been skied everywhere."
"15494400","15495200"," I've skied almost everywhere."
"15495660","15501480"," I think I've skied every single mountain in the northeast, including a few in Canada. "
"15502280","15505040"," I don't think there's a single mountain I have in skied in New England."
"15507420","15508340"," It's kind of wild."
"15509100","15510840"," I've skied everything in the west, not the west. "
"15511060","15511980"," I've skied everything in Colorado."
"15513180","15514500"," I've skied everything in Utah."
"15516240","15517880"," Major resorts in California. "
"15522210","15524270"," Some of the stuff in Montana, Wyoming."
"15524850","15525790"," That's in backcountry, Wyoming."

"15651510","15652450"," I can't do that shit anymore. "
"15653930","15655990"," I got like those bodey-miller knees now."
"15661030","15661990"," And then..."

"15852590","15855350"," There's, I want you guys, I'm going to be honest with you."
"15855370","15856610"," Don't pay attention to Meat Kevin. "
"15858830","15859910"," But I'll be honest."
"15860110","15861550"," Do not pay attention to Meat Kevin."
"15861890","15863830"," But definitely watch that spot camera video. "
"15864970","15865590"," All right."
"15865830","15869030"," Like, make sure that you watch that spot camera video."
"15869710","15870450"," I'm going to warn you. "
"15870450","15875840"," Oh, yeah."
"15877420","15879960"," My arcade calls have recovered."
"15880620","15882700"," Now I've lost more value again. "
"15883740","15885780"," I'm going to need to pull the plug at some point on them."
"15886340","15887880"," How much am I down on those calls?"
"15888680","15889020"," I'm down."
"15890040","15892420"," So earlier today I was down 50%. "
"15892420","15894900"," Now I'm down like 60, 70%."
"15895380","15896440"," And I don't have any."
"15896800","15898860"," I have no expectations for those calls to print. "
"15901740","15903420"," So I have to pull the plug at some point."
"15903580","15904440"," And we're going into the weekend."
"15905180","15906660"," So hopefully I can get out before. "
"15911150","15912410"," Before end of the day today."
"15912670","15914150"," So I don't lose the fate over the weekend."
"15916670","15919530"," Hopefully the bull step up and try to take this rally into the bell. "
"15926040","15928160"," Yeah, yeah, I'll put it in indicators."
"15928560","15930020"," I'm going to come into discord today."
"15932560","15934700"," And you guys tell me what you want me to create. "
"15935020","15939540"," And I will give the ability to mod to add channels."
"15940560","15942300"," So you guys can structure it how you want it."
"15944360","15945860"," I'll put the indicators channel up. "
"15946120","15947860"," I'll put up just a scripts channel."
"15948960","15950400"," And I'm going to try to make a float."
"15950620","15951940"," I'm going to make a float channel for you guys. "
"15952600","15958240"," But at some point what I'll do is I'll pipe a live free feed in there if you want."
"15958900","15960340"," With like a live flow."
"15960480","15961060"," I'll go or something. "
"15961400","15962960"," So if some of you guys aren't paying for flow, I'll go."
"15963320","15964080"," You'll have at it."
"15966780","15968520"," Be careful up here on the. "
"15969200","15970000"," On the spy."
"15971480","15973380"," Not that you can't keep taking this trade."
"15974740","15975800"," Right where we are. "
"15975900","15977380"," We're at a rejection point right now."
"15978300","15981200"," And there's another one hiding above with some sellers."
"15982560","15984960"," Like four thirty six say a seventy nine. "
"15984960","15986240"," Just be careful."
"15988900","15990360"," Be careful right where we are."
"15991420","15995040"," Be careful at four thirty six seventy nine up in here. "
"16000020","16002400"," That doesn't mean we don't push up to four forty."
"16003020","16005020"," Just be careful because they'll sneak in."
"16005720","16006820"," You can see right here too. "
"16007340","16007740"," What was that?"
"16008080","16008820"," You see that right there?"
"16008940","16010040"," There was some more sellers coming in."
"16010500","16011000"," Right in here."
"16011080","16012100"," You see these sellers up here. "
"16012880","16013520"," Four thirty."
"16014280","16015580"," They went right here."
"16015580","16017580"," Four thirty nine sixty six. "
"16018500","16020060"," Four thirty six ninety."
"16021920","16024000"," And there's some right where we are right now."
"16024100","16025280"," There's some sellers hiding. "
"16026880","16028140"," Just be careful of that."
"16030320","16032020"," Watching some Tesla calls come in."
"16032040","16032900"," Spy calls come in. "
"16033080","16033740"," Not much as light."
"16034220","16034860"," Retail stuff."
"16035780","16036460"," Push higher. "
"16051120","16052200"," What's going on?"
"16053860","16056080"," Kevin needs this market to fall further the next month."
"16056080","16058320"," So you can get back in without triggering a wash sale."
"16058600","16060020"," Yeah, it's a fair point, right?"
"16062240","16063180"," That makes sense. "
"16075320","16079440"," I wouldn't I fight the with a call sold against your position."
"16080160","16081280"," Because I took puts."
"16082680","16083580"," They printed. "
"16084840","16087860"," I've already I've already I've already made the money back on the."
"16088800","16091720"," On the on the arc calls."
"16099170","16101270"," Yeah, where we where we roam. "
"16101690","16102790"," Good points, brother."
"16103470","16110840"," Yeah, we're not getting we're not getting a forty seven percent decline."
"16111380","16111720"," Well. "
"16112600","16113960"," I shouldn't say that."
"16114180","16114580"," So."
"16115920","16118700"," There are some moments. "
"16121040","16122600"," There are some things."
"16122600","16128180"," It's a very, very small tail risk that we decline forty seven percent."
"16130840","16134480"," There are some triggers for that to happen. "
"16136160","16139180"," But it's very, very minute."
"16141920","16143680"," Very, very, very minute."
"16144580","16147540"," You want there's a there's a few moments that could trigger it. "
"16147860","16150260"," And there's a market moment that could trigger it."
"16151000","16151440"," But."
"16153160","16155960"," God, that would be like that would be like two years from now. "
"16156180","16157280"," Three years from now, maybe."
"16159440","16161040"," That would be a moment that would take."
"16163300","16165080"," Let's see me decline thirty percent this year. "
"16165240","16167380"," And next year, you actually saw people getting in trouble."
"16167840","16170720"," Like those middle income people and those upper middle income people."
"16171000","16172440"," If they get into trouble. "
"16173460","16176100"," There could be that moment we trade down a forty seven percent."
"16176100","16177660"," But you're talking way down the road."
"16178100","16179980"," Or at least projected way down the road. "
"16180680","16181020"," So."
"16181660","16182860"," Yeah, it's possible."
"16183360","16183500"," But. "
"16184620","16187120"," If he thinks for trading down a two six nine right now, he can."
"16187780","16188920"," He can eat a bag of dicks."
"16191320","16192480"," I haven't watched the video. "
"16192480","16194380"," So I don't know his context."
"16196420","16198880"," I trust Darius over me Kevin."
"16200180","16200620"," Sorry. "
"16205360","16207280"," There are many stocks below that."
"16212420","16214340"," Typically war is good for markets."
"16214680","16215480"," There can be an initial. "
"16216440","16217720"," There can be an initial."
"16219360","16221920"," You know, like shock crash to the market."
"16222180","16223260"," I don't know if they're really crash, but. "
"16223800","16225300"," Just a rip down."
"16228600","16229800"," That's going way out of bounds."
"16230060","16232500"," Like say thinking that we're going to go to a conventional war. "
"16232500","16234500"," With China and Russia's."
"16236680","16237640"," Not probable."
"16239400","16240420"," At this point. "
"16242260","16243260"," It's not probable."
"16244180","16244840"," There could be."
"16245920","16246500"," A."
"16249240","16253220"," A conflict that indirectly were involved in with China and Russia. "
"16253420","16257600"," But to think that we go to full scale conventional war with China and Russia's."
"16257840","16258660"," Not probable."
"16260120","16262720"," In the on the background of Russia. "
"16263660","16264300"," Russia."
"16264500","16266460"," I'll be honest with you about Russia is the truth."
"16267220","16270780"," Russia has a lot of funding problems with its military. "
"16271540","16274520"," For a for all out full scale conventional war."
"16275540","16276240"," Russia's poor."
"16277460","16279620"," Their economy is getting hit right now currently. "
"16280980","16281940"," Right now."
"16282680","16284600"," Before sanctions have even taken place."
"16285700","16287800"," China has a problem with their military. "
"16288740","16292320"," There's some grander scale things to that to this argument because."
"16294580","16296200"," China's China's a rule to see."
"16296680","16298420"," They don't really oceans of the world. "
"16298420","16300220"," They don't rule the sky as well."
"16301640","16304420"," So if you're talking like full scale conventional war."
"16304800","16305760"," They're not quite there yet. "
"16306420","16309020"," They will be at some point, but they're not there yet right now."
"16311600","16313420"," That's a much bigger conversation."
"16314480","16316080"," And Russia doesn't have that. "
"16316520","16317200"," As a matter of fact."
"16318780","16320660"," Ukraine's forces are larger than they think."
"16324200","16327380"," That's why there's I guess there's another hundred thousand troops going to the border with Russia. "
"16327400","16330000"," They have a hundred thousand there now and a hundred thousand showing up."
"16330080","16332960"," That's because Ukraine has like two hundred thousand troops."
"16334560","16337080"," And then you're talking about prior service people. "
"16337080","16339960"," Ukraine's very much like the United States in some respects."
"16341440","16345020"," They're kind of they mimic the United States often."
"16345560","16347080"," They have a lot of prior service military. "
"16347620","16349540"," They have a lot of retired military people."
"16349820","16350600"," They have a lot of militias."
"16351860","16355940"," They're now being supplied with troops from the U.S. from UK. "
"16358220","16360020"," Conventional wars changed a lot."
"16360780","16363740"," So if you have like a country like let's say."
"16365060","16366180"," Russia versus. "
"16367700","16374020"," Insurgence armed with missiles, shoulder fired missiles, man pads and stuff like that."
"16374560","16375560"," That's one thing."
"16375800","16376640"," But if you have them. "
"16377380","16382360"," If you have them fighting a conventional war against another conventionally a conventional war"
"16382360","16382680"," country."
"16383020","16384500"," That has those same man pads."
"16385700","16386880"," Now that kind of warfare. "
"16388759","16390419"," Is almost extinct."
"16391660","16395320"," That's why we're reverting building new our star new destroyers."
"16395960","16397200"," We're not bothering. "
"16397259","16400560"," We built a bunch of experimental destroyers for our Navy."
"16402119","16406180"," And we're we are reverting back to old style destroyers."
"16406360","16408900"," Because our tech has gotten us to a point where. "
"16409880","16414040"," We can fire rockets air to ship."
"16414840","16419220"," Over horizons 500 miles away and knock a ship out of the middle of the ocean."
"16423599","16427419"," So that's really where if you put like two conventional forces against each other. "
"16428259","16430259"," Like the tank battles never going to happen."
"16431720","16433640"," Tanks a tank battle will never happen."
"16434099","16438599"," Conventional warfare amongst conventional warfare countries will never happen as you think it would"
"16438599","16439160"," happen anymore. "
"16439160","16448119"," A lot of the old style old school fighting even if it's conventional no nukes just conventional"
"16448119","16452040"," fighting between two conventional countries with real militaries."
"16452900","16455040"," The battle will be over before it even begins."
"16457080","16462669"," If we're fighting the rack or some shit. "
"16463630","16464029"," That's different."
"16464490","16469790"," But if we're fighting if we were fighting like a Russia or even China would be over before it even"
"16469790","16470029"," began."
"16472950","16474349"," And Russia knows this. "
"16474570","16475689"," They're they're poor."
"16476050","16477110"," They're their military is poor."
"16478410","16484650"," And China just doesn't have the China doesn't have the they've got cheapness to their military. "
"16492580","16495520"," Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying there will be skirmishes or fighting."
"16495960","16499220"," But I don't think that it turns into what we think it could turn into."
"16504349","16506349"," Like all our war across Europe. "
"16507189","16508689"," More than likely not going to happen."
"16519619","16520099"," Thanks."
"16520220","16522279"," They'll regret giving up their next 20. "
"16522520","16524599"," You know, they're there are threats right now."
"16524939","16531080"," I saw some threats online of insurgents from Ukraine threatening to go in and destroy the power"
"16531080","16531700"," grid of Russia."
"16534240","16536240"," They could get real violence real fast. "
"16536860","16541099"," I think I think when you're I think it's weird you like you you like try to look at maybe"
"16541099","16544200"," like a rack had like the fourth largest army in the world."
"16544640","16546180"," When we invaded, did you know that?"
"16546939","16549500"," I don't know if you knew that like a rack had."
"16550180","16552980"," I think the fourth largest military in the world. "
"16554720","16556480"," And we rolled right over them."
"16557119","16558779"," I don't think people understand the scale."
"16560259","16562320"," The might of the US military. "
"16562320","16568160"," I think that if you're a soldier, if you're if you've ever served in the military, you probably"
"16568160","16568540"," know."
"16569140","16570800"," Some of you probably know."
"16571480","16572279"," It's really weird. "
"16572460","16576200"," It's bizarre like what we think civilians what they think of the US military."
"16577300","16582300"," And the reality of our military versus any other conventional force."
"16584860","16586900"," You know, we have like we dominate. "
"16587300","16589380"," We run the world, whether you know it or not."
"16591080","16594439"," We can take losses and stuff and insurgencies and things like that."
"16594580","16600180"," But in an all out combat or all out conventional war, I would not want to step up against the"
"16600180","16600800"," United States. "
"16602640","16608000"," We have our own problems and stuff, but we spend trillions."
"16611119","16613580"," On military readiness versus other nations."
"16616279","16625189"," Yeah, or yeah, Iraq had the fourth largest military in the world. "
"16625710","16627770"," Might have been the might have been the third largest military."
"16627970","16628770"," I think it was."
"16628970","16631210"," I think it's like the US then it's Russia. "
"16632029","16633990"," I don't know who number three was."
"16634490","16635689"," It could have been China."
"16637009","16640310"," I think Iraq was number four and they were venerated. "
"16640910","16643750"," Before Iraq, right before Iraq started, they were venerated."
"16643750","16646710"," They had Russian Russian tanks."
"16647070","16651410"," They have, you know, standing army and they were battle hard and you have to remember too. "
"16651529","16654970"," Like they fought Iran and it was a brutal fight."
"16655210","16658330"," I mean, those guys are at war for a long time."
"16658509","16664669"," So even when the military is venerated, you have to understand the scale of that veneration versus"
"16664669","16665189"," us. "
"16666710","16671070"," You know, for every like for every one of so that someone else has, we have like 20."
"16681119","16682560"," Now wars don't make sense."
"16683680","16684840"," Yeah, any is up there. "
"16686619","16688800"," So they were the fifth largest in the world."
"16690220","16694680"," And did you was there any kind of a fight in Iraq?"
"16695080","16695900"," Do you guys remember?"
"16698099","16699520"," You remember what happened, right?"
"16700599","16701520"," It was like a three day war."
"16704080","16706279"," It was literally like a three day war. "
"16707740","16709220"," It was over before it began."
"16718419","16722220"," Yeah, it was once like the fourth largest at one time."
"16722619","16724520"," It wasn't even a fight. "
"16726419","16733939"," I mean, the road out of out of Kuwait, they don't show a lot of pictures of what happened when"
"16733939","16736860"," Iraq evacuated Kuwait."
"16736860","16741820"," It was ugly."
"16742960","16747119"," Almost all you call almost, I mean, you call it a war crime, but they just finished committing war"
"16747119","16748220"," crimes themselves, right?"
"16750800","16753160"," Just get a scale of conventional war. "
"16753300","16758259"," The United States is against another country that's using conventional means."
"16759119","16763980"," Like if you've got an aggressor, if you had like, if you had like Russia invaded Ukraine or Iraq"
"16763980","16765419"," when they invaded Kuwait."
"16768500","16770480"," Or if China was to invade Taiwan. "
"16771080","16774599"," And they say things like, you know, Taiwan couldn't put up a fight or something, but I'm telling"
"16774599","16774980"," you like."
"16778680","16784330"," You want to mess with the U.S.? Well, not even that."
"16784910","16789850"," Think about even like the U.S. You have to understand that a tank war wouldn't take place. "
"16790530","16797030"," If you control the skies and you control the oceans and you try a tank battle, right?"
"16797310","16799670"," You wouldn't even get to that point before the U.S. tanks would roll in."
"16800170","16801850"," You'd just be carpet bomb the fucking hell."
"16802770","16806930"," You'd be dead before you even got there as a tank, as a, you know, and that's what we did. "
"16807090","16810710"," We went into Iraq and we knocked out literally all their air force."
"16811810","16816890"," We knocked all their communications down and that was it."
"16816890","16819490"," You can bring every, you can bring 500 tanks. "
"16820450","16821170"," You're going down."
"16825610","16827070"," The Navy is the big one."
"16835640","16839280"," The propaganda minister with the gold plated AK-47. "
"16840340","16842340"," I wasn't, I was too young for Kuwait."
"16843160","16846000"," I was just told enough for Serbia and Bosnia."
"16846620","16848480"," So I was a young buck then. "
"16849060","16852820"," So I joined, I originally joined the Army for four years to pay for college."
"16854880","16856900"," So I was in a UN flag for a brief moment there."
"16857240","16859160"," And then I, you guys want to hear something crazy?"
"16861100","16864660"," So I got out of the Army and I was bored and I was in college. "
"16866280","16869260"," And I wanted, I had free time and I needed to make some money."
"16869880","16871120"," So I was like, oh, I was like, you know what I'll do?"
"16871760","16875360"," I was like, I'll, I'll re-sign up for the Army for the reserves."
"16875360","16878660"," I was like, oh, no, actually that's not how it took place. "
"16879180","16880540"," So let me start from the beginning."
"16881020","16882220"," So I was out of the Army."
"16882480","16886020"," You guys will like this story, especially if any of you are prior military, prior service. "
"16886640","16887580"," You guys will like this story."
"16888300","16889240"," This is a true story."
"16891040","16892920"," This is a, this is a crazy true story. "
"16893800","16898540"," So I want to rejoin the military and they weren't taking, this is just before 9-11."
"16898720","16901960"," It was one or two years, but I think it was like year 2000."
"16904460","16906480"," And I wanted to get back in the military. "
"16908140","16909280"," And they told me no."
"16911220","16912560"," They weren't taking prior service."
"16914940","16918440"," So I went back to my original recruiter and told him. "
"16920420","16922340"," And he told me there's no way he could get me in."
"16924220","16926480"," And I was like, this is out, you know, complete bullshit."
"16927360","16929500"," He said, there's one way I can get you in. "
"16929700","16930320"," And I said, how?"
"16930980","16932580"," He said, but you wouldn't want to do it."
"16932760","16937140"," He goes, you have to go through basic training again, post it training."
"16939960","16942260"," And I'll get, he's like, I'll sign you, I'll get you in. "
"16943740","16945020"," He goes, we'll lose your paperwork."
"16945760","16949080"," And when you're done with your basic training, you go down to like S-11."
"16950980","16954300"," And tell them then, hey, I'm prior service, you must have lost my records. "
"16956120","16958080"," And once you're through, they won't kick you out."
"16962060","16965680"," So I re-signed up, had to go through maps again."
"16966680","16969180"," As a matter of fact, I failed my vision test. "
"16970100","16972480"," So my second time in, I couldn't go into combat arms."
"16972820","16975260"," I couldn't go, I tried to go into the Army National Guard."
"16975940","16978220"," But I wasn't eligible because I had been colorblind. "
"16978880","16981600"," So I had to go back in my recruiter, got me in as a driver."
"16982000","16983340"," I re-classed as a driver."
"16988520","16992720"," And I went to basic training for a second time. "
"16995140","16996880"," And I was asked when I was there."
"16997600","17001080"," I got pulled out, we're in like some hold under or some shit like that."
"17001320","17007200"," And I got some, some sergeants came out of whatever and started asking. "
"17007420","17008100"," I'm not drill sergeants."
"17008240","17010580"," They're, they're called, there's like different drill sergeants."
"17011880","17017400"," That are in your, your receiving or whatever. "
"17018000","17022040"," And they're asking me a bunch of questions like, Hey, Martell, are you private, are you a prior"
"17022040","17022440"," service?"
"17022760","17023700"," You look like a prior service."
"17023860","17024820"," You're sure you're not prior service?"
"17025300","17025960"," All kinds of shit."
"17026480","17028240"," Because you kind of look like a prior service, kind of know what you're doing. "
"17028780","17030020"," I'm trying to hide it and all that, right?"
"17030180","17031200"," So I get in, I do my thing."
"17033120","17037580"," And I go through training a second time, quiet about the whole entire thing."
"17037580","17043460"," High speed, no drag soldier, uh, PG, all that stuff, right?"
"17044640","17045880"," Kicking ass, taking names. "
"17047080","17050480"," It's like my last, it's like my last week or two."
"17051820","17052580"," Before I graduate."
"17053220","17054800"," And I go to my drill sergeant. "
"17055100","17055940"," So I'm like, Hey, drill sergeant."
"17056960","17060940"," I'm like, I got to go down to S 11 and get my, uh, get my records, my prior service"
"17060940","17063520"," records so that my, my record is correct for graduation."
"17064320","17068200"," So I want to wear all my prior service rank and all that other shit and I'm fucking whatever. "
"17068780","17070860"," Those guys found out that I was prior service."
"17071940","17075920"," And they smoked my ass for a whole entire day."
"17076860","17081960"," We got smoked up and smoked down, run down to the, to the telephones across the quad, back up. "
"17082480","17086340"," I had my poly pros tucked underneath my uniform underneath my B to use, trying to hide them so I"
"17086340","17086860"," could stay warm."
"17087800","17089960"," And, uh, they smoked me, smoked me bad."
"17091000","17092660"," Smoked me a graduation in front of everybody. "
"17094680","17097740"," But, uh, they graduated me, kept me in the army, kept my job."
"17099140","17101060"," And I was able to stay in the reserves, right?"
"17101220","17101900"," So now I'm in the reserves."
"17104060","17110080"," And I think I went to Korea for, uh, I did a, I was out of college for the summer"
"17110080","17114560"," and I did a, um, I figured what it's called now. "
"17115400","17118300"," It's like a, uh, it's like 30 day duty."
"17118660","17121720"," Like you're like, you're like, um, active duty, AGR."
"17121980","17122980"," It's called active guard reserve. "
"17123240","17127120"," So I went over to Korea on some TTY stuff for the summer, came back home."
"17128400","17133740"," I'm sitting out, uh, men's school and, uh, I was, I was stationed."
"17134620","17142140"," I was a driver for a battalion command or something at an airport, uh, in New England. "
"17144920","17146280"," And 9-11 happened."
"17147580","17151040"," And I, I normally never got a call that early in the morning, but I woke up to it on"
"17151040","17152220"," the radio, whatever I got a phone call."
"17153860","17162220"," Until we get down to the, uh, to the base, right?"
"17162380","17163480"," The base is right outside of the airport. "
"17163740","17164380"," So I get down there."
"17165380","17169440"," And, uh, they had me with a little, they had me to send me to New York City."
"17171720","17176160"," Well, first, when I first got down there, they, we blocked off the airport. "
"17177020","17179460"," We had loaded weapons and comms up and everything."
"17179460","17181220"," Never did that in the U.S. ever."
"17182200","17185000"," Never have never, ever held a loaded weapon and conists. "
"17186600","17188680"," Uh, so we did that, shut everything down."
"17189460","17191380"," First time in life, someone's ever held a door for me."
"17191820","17193800"," Prior to that, uh, you've never seen anybody. "
"17194140","17201020"," And all that, like Walmart warrior, like, uh, all that Walmart warrior, like, uh, freedom stuff and"
"17201020","17201680"," think of veteran."
"17202080","17203460"," That shit was never going on prior to that."
"17203460","17206400"," But that day and that weekend that changed. "
"17206920","17213620"," And then it was really bizarre and, uh, went to New York City when, when, when the initial strikes"
"17213620","17214080"," happened."
"17214640","17217820"," Uh, something I never want to experience or talk about."
"17220280","17230210"," Um, it was really weird too, because I went later, I wound up being"
"17230210","17234450"," transferred to Denver and then I was transferred to U.S. Army Command as a driver for a two star. "
"17235950","17242570"," And, uh, it was weird, like, 9-11 happened out in the West, but not like it happened in the"
"17242570","17242910"," East."
"17243690","17245790"," It was a different experience if you're from New York."
"17246930","17250370"," Uh, the, the pure devastation that took place. "
"17253960","17258800"," It was funny, though, too, because, of course, from that point forward, being prior service, no one"
"17258800","17259460"," had a problem with it."
"17260600","17265540"," Uh, then, of course, I got orders for, uh, um, for our first airborne."
"17265540","17267500"," We had driver for 101st Airborne in Iraq. "
"17270200","17278100"," Uh, and then after that, uh, that I had finished up six years, went into, uh, sorry, coming orders"
"17278100","17278560"," for Iraq."
"17278780","17279000"," It was crazy."
"17279240","17280720"," I was down my six years. "
"17280920","17282280"," I went to the Enactive Ready Reserve."
"17283540","17289980"," And that's when they stopped last to me and they gave me orders for 365 days in Iraq with 101st"
"17289980","17290240"," Airborne."
"17290580","17300340"," And, of course, you know, when they're done with you, uh, they didn't want to retain me after that,"
"17300340","17300700"," so. "
"17306060","17306660"," That's all true."
"17307720","17310860"," And, of course, they didn't want to stay back in anymore either."
"17311080","17312920"," You know, you, you have, like, fooled me once, fooled me twice. "
"17313760","17316140"," I don't know if any of you guys are prior service out there, but you guys know about that whole"
"17316140","17316500"," thing, right?"
"17316500","17319560"," Like, you can't even get me to go into the VA."
"17321020","17323200"," I don't, I don't even, I don't go to the VFW."
"17323580","17332090"," I don't, uh, they don't, I don't, I never let it take over my life. "
"17332370","17334410"," Like, I know a lot of you guys know about this stuff, so."
"17336630","17339210"," It's like, it was part of my life, but it didn't want to be my life."
"17341670","17342910"," I have a lot of my friends. "
"17343210","17345150"," They, it's their life that they've never got."
"17345290","17347690"," They've never, it's never stopped being their life."
"17347690","17348850"," So someone was saying more sucks. "
"17349210","17349930"," It does suck."
"17352490","17355470"," And a lot of, a lot of guys, a lot of women, they never come back for more."
"17355690","17362690"," Even when they come back home here, uh, to the U.S. They've, it's consumed their lives. "
"17362870","17363630"," That's all they are, right?"
"17363770","17364550"," They identify with that."
"17364790","17366270"," I can't repress them."
"17366410","17371970"," I'm that soldier that's like, uh, you don't, uh, I didn't want it to consume my life. "
"17372830","17374310"," Because it can easily consume your life."
"17377270","17381750"," I'm, I'm more of the soldier where you pound it down and bury it somewhere, right?"
"17382150","17383490"," I did go to counseling eventually."
"17384970","17389890"," That's what I can move on with my life, but like the army teaches you that. "
"17390170","17393190"," You just, you just pound it down as deep down as you possibly can."
"17393330","17393910"," You move on with life."
"17395170","17395970"," Isn't that crazy?"
"17399230","17400870"," I'm wearing a camouflage shirt. "
"17403230","17403630"," No."
"17403630","17403790"," No."
"17405830","17406190"," No. "
"17406410","17407270"," Don't talk about it often."
"17407890","17410330"," Uh, try not to talk about it too often."
"17411370","17412630"," Because, uh, I've seen it. "
"17412710","17413090"," I've seen it."
"17413270","17415810"," It ends horribly for some soldiers or veterans."
"17416350","17419170"," It ends horribly for guys that that's all they've ever been. "
"17419430","17420710"," Like a lot of guys, that's all they've ever known."
"17420730","17421930"," And then they'll take kicks them out."
"17422470","17423410"," They have nowhere else to go, whatever. "
"17432930","17433290"," Yeah."
"17436520","17436640"," Yep."
"17436960","17437160"," Suck it up. "
"17437260","17437740"," Drive on soldier."
"17439440","17440160"," Drive on."
"17440400","17441260"," What makes green grass grow?"
"17443580","17446160"," Bright, red blood makes green grass grow. "
"17458760","17460360"," Kind of puttering out here, right?"
"17460560","17462100"," A little bit more cellar stepping in right here."
"17462120","17463580"," Be careful around this area here."
"17464080","17465280"," 437, a little bit of cellar. "
"17465520","17466820"," Look, looking for some weakness here."
"17467980","17468700"," Careful of that."
"17478360","17479960"," That was a floating head. "
"17480300","17480980"," Put that shirt on."
"17487000","17487520"," Oh, yeah."
"17487780","17488520"," Don't get me wrong. "
"17488700","17494120"," I'm so I come from the, uh, I want to be clear about something."
"17494980","17498560"," That I served my country not for political reasons."
"17499120","17502980"," I come from a family that serves from an idealist. "
"17503440","17504980"," There's like different people that serve the military."
"17506280","17507140"," That's another thing to note."
"17507340","17509020"," You've got some psychos that join the military. "
"17509880","17512280"," You've got people that get out of, they have no other choice, right?"
"17512280","17514200"," I didn't know that until I joined the military."
"17516360","17517440"," Some people come from real."
"17517540","17521380"," It's really the only way for them to get out of living a horrible life. "
"17521960","17524160"," So I respect the military for that 100%."
"17524820","17527040"," I come from a family that served our nation."
"17528100","17529980"," My wife's family serves their nation. "
"17530140","17530940"," My father still served."
"17531100","17533780"," My brother serves our nation, but we're not political."
"17534060","17534780"," We're very political. "
"17535060","17539480"," It's more from the ideals of what we can possibly be."
"17539480","17540860"," Be a better nation."
"17543320","17546140"," Protect those ideals, even if even if we suck out of it sometimes. "
"17548920","17550380"," And generationally, we've done this."
"17553840","17556060"," So I felt like I would my father was a Vietnam veteran."
"17557040","17561880"," And it didn't kick in for me until I became 17, 18 years old. "
"17561880","17564420"," I realized that I had to do what my dad did."
"17565480","17565520"," Right?"
"17566700","17567780"," That's I was that soldier."
"17569480","17570200"," Your dad did it. "
"17570720","17572280"," Both the parents and veterans, both officers."
"17572440","17574180"," My dad had a top intelligence kind of hula."
"17574720","17575140"," Right on. "
"17578400","17579300"," I read that Emerson."
"17582460","17584860"," Yeah, I do friendly wages with Army Navy guys."
"17585300","17585700"," Oh, yeah. "
"17587660","17588860"," I'm always talking shit."
"17590080","17591600"," Yeah, I love my service to my nation."
"17592440","17593900"," I love my service to humans. "
"17594260","17596440"," Like I love my service."
"17597660","17598500"," You had a freedom."
"17599980","17602580"," And we'll do the right thing that we are going to be the leader of the free world. "
"17602580","17603420"," Even if we make mistakes."
"17605880","17606740"," You know that kind of stuff."
"17610330","17613650"," Yeah, thank you for all your service out there. "
"17613690","17614110"," If you're a veteran."
"17615430","17616390"," Thank you for your service."
"17620390","17621550"," Yeah, I didn't want to be an officer. "
"17621950","17622470"," It's kind of funny."
"17623910","17625390"," I had a lot of friends become officers."
"17625810","17626090"," Here we go. "
"17626090","17627030"," You guys ready to go up to 440?"
"17629050","17631950"," So I want to become an officer because you lose your command authority."
"17633430","17635910"," And they end up making you a pencil pusher."
"17636950","17638470"," Especially if you're too good at your job. "
"17640190","17644430"," If you're too good at your job in the military, they'll take your command away from you."
"17645210","17646110"," Which really sucks."
"17648430","17651050"," So I'll be honest with if you ever want to join the military, right?"
"17651230","17655710"," If you're high speed, no drag kind of guy, it's always better to 437-64. "
"17656770","17660490"," It's always better to be an NCO."
"17662390","17663670"," Always better to be an NCO."
"17664470","17665490"," Because you can blow shit up. "
"17665630","17666390"," Tell people what to do."
"17669950","17670350"," Right?"
"17670950","17671750"," You can lead people."
"17672650","17677290"," Like there's nothing you ask a, you ask a lieutenant what they missed the most. "
"17677430","17678890"," It's the first lieutenant what they missed the most."
"17679070","17679690"," It's leading troops."
"17680390","17681730"," There's nothing like leading troops. "
"17682730","17683810"," Best feeling in the world."
"17684390","17685810"," Like there's nothing like it."
"17685910","17686950"," Protecting your soldiers. "
"17687230","17688350"," Taking care of your soldiers."
"17688930","17690150"," Making sure that they're safe."
"17691850","17696070"," There's nothing like, there's nothing quite like leading people in the military. "
"17696530","17697770"," Especially a cohesive unit."
"17698990","17699910"," Nothing like it."
"17700870","17705530"," Like you make bonds with these guys and those bonds are there forever and ever and ever and ever. "
"17705790","17705890"," Right?"
"17706570","17707390"," You follow them anywhere."
"17708570","17709390"," There's nothing like it."
"17710050","17714570"," And so that's one part about the military that kind of sucks is. "
"17715530","17718070"," If you're an officer, you're typically, if you're especially if you're any good."
"17719110","17720110"," You're usually gone."
"17720910","17721830"," Use your command authority. "
"17723530","17727260"," A warrant officer is best."
"17727560","17730740"," If there was one, if you could get the vaunted warrant officer."
"17732080","17733220"," That's badass too. "
"17733820","17735440"," A warrant officers are badass."
"17738240","17740040"," But you want to keep command authority."
"17740800","17742140"," The command authority rules like. "
"17743140","17744580"," Okay, you guys want to know when to short?"
"17746220","17747740"," I don't think we're there yet."
"17747780","17748860"," I think we ride up to 440."
"17749740","17751720"," I think we do this short covering job. "
"17752500","17753220"," Right in the close."
"17755240","17757220"," And I'll be looking to take a short at the close."
"17759440","17761960"," I have pretty good faith in 440 P."
"17762960","17763820"," Expiring. "
"17764820","17766900"," On February, 18th of printing."
"17769980","17772080"," I bet between I bet."
"17773340","17775500"," Between now and next. "
"17775720","17779780"," That I'll print a 440 P."
"17784420","17785520"," I'll bet."
"17792440","17793380"," Is next."
"17799220","17800620"," I got a double check. "
"17800800","17801860"," Make sure I don't get whacked."
"17804360","17805200"," Yeah, look at that."
"17805280","17806940"," Opex is February 18th. "
"17807060","17810700"," You're telling me I'm not going to print 440 P between now and Opex."
"17811360","17812320"," Get out of here."
"17818740","17819900"," Yeah, look up CVX. "
"17822840","17825300"," Well, what you do, right, is you just inverse the whole bear."
"17825580","17826720"," The whole bull thesis, right?"
"17827160","17828100"," We're trading up here."
"17828100","17832080"," What you do is you become slightly bearish. "
"17832720","17833280"," Right?"
"17835640","17838320"," You grab yourself some in the money put spreads."
"17841480","17842940"," You expire them out."
"17843300","17845120"," And you know the next OPEX?"
"17845280","17846300"," That's February 18th. "
"17846740","17850420"," You already know that the bears are in for like millions of dollars down to 408."
"17853520","17855280"," So you got that working for you."
"17855560","17857440"," Then you ask yourself, how high do we trade?"
"17858800","17860460"," Between now and February 18th. "
"17860520","17863460"," Let's say, let's say you're uber bullish and you're like, we're trading a 450 cap."
"17864060","17864460"," Okay."
"17864920","17865760"," So we trade up to 450. "
"17866540","17867260"," That's reasonable."
"17868500","17869480"," We trade 450."
"17869860","17873060"," But next OPEX, do you think we trade to 460?"
"17873740","17875020"," Or do you think we trade back down to 440?"
"17881680","17882680"," Never seen any aliens. "
"17884360","17886940"," But I have seen a lot of weird stuff in the military."
"17887680","17888620"," I was a driver, remember?"
"17888900","17890760"," So I started driving for generals and stuff."
"17890760","17892040"," So you see what those guys see?"
"17892280","17893120"," That shit's wild. "
"17895220","17896500"," There's 450 up there."
"17897720","17900680"," There's sellers at 440 or 43961."
"17902300","17905340"," You can tag along that little bit of support down here at 430. "
"17905800","17906600"," Just waiting to buy the dip."
"17909760","17911240"," Let's see if we can get a clearer view."
"17917990","17919710"," Let's see if we can get 440 out of the day. "
"17922030","17922990"," Let's see the aliens."
"17925590","17927330"," Nice little pump into the clothes here."
"17927750","17928930"," Got some V calls. "
"17931370","17935650"," Verizon's June 17th, 230C, $700,000."
"17936310","17940030"," A lot of bulls still taking bets out there."
"17940610","17942110"," Haven't exhausted the bulls yet. "
"17943190","17944490"," No capitulation by the bulls."
"17949520","17951560"," Looking for that squeeze higher to 440."
"17966610","17970850"," I'm still holding 390Ps that I bought up 420 on Monday. "
"17970850","17972310"," I'm going to sell them now and buy calls."
"17972930","17973810"," Good job with that, Josh."
"17974190","17974550"," Way to go. "
"17975890","17976790"," No, not much."
"17977130","17979770"," Everything today has been focused on just day trading."
"17980610","17982390"," You want to talk about notable stuff?"
"17983210","17984790"," We're neutral in the market right now. "
"17985210","17986450"," So your flow sentiment is neutral."
"17987350","17992710"," Put to call ratios 0.896. Put flow is 500,000 puts."
"17993090","17994330"," Call flow is 569. "
"17996410","17998430"," It's pretty much even Stephen across the board."
"17999390","18001350"," We know that we've had some squeezing today."
"18001510","18003170"," Not squeezing, but short covering today. "
"18003870","18004510"," To be expected."
"18006410","18007790"," Bears want better positioning."
"18008730","18010130"," You want to see the Vicks come down. "
"18010690","18012710"," If you're bearish, you want to see the Vicks come down."
"18012850","18014610"," You don't want to see the Vicks up at the freaking 35."
"18015570","18016050"," Right?"
"18017270","18018630"," You want to see the Vicks drop?"
"18021230","18024550"," Could we get some more green into next week?"
"18024710","18025010"," It's possible. "
"18026370","18032110"," You know, we've got a nice support though here at 27.59 on the Vicks."
"18033070","18034190"," The Vicks could fall."
"18034350","18035690"," We could have a rally into next week. "
"18036690","18038210"," Not anti-araly into next week."
"18039350","18045290"," My only concern is that you could have the Vicks drop off for the next week and yet the market"
"18045290","18046670"," trades sideways for a week."
"18047430","18049350"," You're going to see a point in fact, right?"
"18049950","18052070"," We were at 39 on the Vicks. "
"18052610","18053590"," We're now down at 28."
"18054710","18055970"," And we're right at 440."
"18058030","18061390"," So the Vicks is falling and the market hasn't gone anywhere. "
"18063810","18068130"," So even if we made another 10 points up, we still have an elevated Vicks right now."
"18070390","18071570"," And why are we elevated?"
"18079170","18082110"," We should have a Vicks that's just crashing at this point, right?"
"18088100","18089440"," So I don't know what to say to you."
"18095400","18097320"," For myself, I don't care where we trade to. "
"18097440","18098180"," I'm looking to short."
"18099000","18100840"," I'm looking to take put call spreads right now."
"18101080","18104340"," If we trade up into the 450, I'll look for weekly puts. "
"18105160","18108580"," If we trade higher, I'll look for put FDs at that point."
"18117200","18119200"," 420 blaze puts for Monday at 30 cents."
"18119200","18120820"," Yeah, that's another thing. "
"18121700","18124560"," You want to start seeing puts come down in price, right?"
"18124960","18126100"," People get greedy again."
"18126980","18128140"," We could trade up on Monday."
"18128800","18130280"," I'm not an NTS trading up Monday. "
"18130680","18132620"," I think we're going to trade down."
"18133160","18137420"," You've got a lot of money still out there hedging this market."
"18137600","18139520"," So even if we don't trade down, they're still there. "
"18140160","18143140"," You're just waiting for the moment when we trade back down and retest."
"18145440","18147920"," And we haven't seen any farther out call structure."
"18148740","18152040"," I haven't I haven't seen a bunch of spy calls for February. "
"18153600","18155360"," Maybe we see him after the bell today."
"18155800","18157080"," Oh, look at this one right here, right?"
"18157320","18158340"," Oh, that's actually looks good."
"18159100","18160380"," So I did see. "
"18161440","18162360"," I missed this one."
"18163280","18164640"," There was spy."
"18166740","18169620"," 370 P for December, 2024. "
"18172740","18175800"," Spy December 20, 2024."
"18175800","18178620"," 370 P for $10 million."
"18188310","18190430"," Spy 370 P."
"18191490","18192410"," $10 million. "
"18195730","18198710"," For 12, 20, 24."
"18212620","18214740"," Yes, you heard it here first."
"18217020","18218600"," They're not fucking around. "
"18218840","18219160"," I promise."
"18226010","18227250"," Ten mill."
"18232520","18234140"," Ten milly. "
"18236870","18238430"," The contracts cost."
"18243350","18246830"," $36 a contract."
"18250380","18252240"," They ain't fucking around. "
"18252540","18252780"," They promise."
"18254660","18259670"," They ain't fucking around."
"18262130","18268650"," In the background behind closed doors, you and I are now watching. "
"18269030","18270510"," They are not fucking around."
"18288760","18297500"," So they remind me of a you can buy you can buy VIX leaps."
"18298480","18300560"," And it's for market crash. "
"18301640","18306120"," You buy them you can buy leaps fraud and VIX that are two, three years out."
"18306820","18309620"," And basically they don't lose any value."
"18310620","18312280"," Unless there's a market crash. "
"18315600","18318260"," So basically someone just put a $10 million bet."
"18320020","18323560"," That will probably hold its value quite well."
"18326680","18329320"," With an implied move down to 360. "
"18330540","18331700"," Before end of this year."
"18333480","18334240"," Or lower."
"18335480","18336080"," Probably 320. "
"18337100","18338160"," My number is 326."
"18339620","18340540"," That's the number that I've got."
"18340940","18342160"," 326 by end of year. "
"18344800","18345980"," So it makes sense, right?"
"18347080","18348220"," 20 points in the money."
"18349920","18352700"," And then you got 260 or 360s."
"18353720","18354780"," We trade trade down to 326. "
"18356400","18357240"," In a year to do it."
"18358480","18361740"," If the market just trades sideways and down over the course of the year."
"18361880","18363460"," They'll just keep printing and holding value. "
"18364480","18365780"," And then you unload them."
"18367440","18370320"," You don't hold them until 2024."
"18370760","18373160"," You get rid of them at the end of 2025, 23. "
"18384390","18388490"," You take them so long out because they hold their intrinsic value for longer."
"18390570","18393570"," And they relatively don't lose that much value."
"18394490","18397390"," And if the market were to trade sideways and down, they would hold their value. "
"18398930","18402570"," Long enough to cover risk on a long position in the market."
"18404470","18405450"," It's like a market."
"18405710","18407170"," It's basically a market crash. "
"18408310","18409130"," Or market decline trade."
"18410910","18412750"," And they would probably roll them out."
"18412750","18414350"," You could probably roll them out every three months. "
"18422260","18424200"," And it doesn't matter because what happens, right?"
"18425020","18426440"," Until the risk subsides."
"18427400","18431020"," If the stock market goes up in your big position, the stock market keeps going up."
"18431360","18432400"," It'll pay for that bet. "
"18433940","18436680"," Then you can unload them at some point if risk leaves the market."
"18449540","18452420"," Okay, so what I want you to do is I want you to go."
"18452900","18455400"," If you guys are just tuning in right now, I want you to take a moment. "
"18457640","18458980"," Just floating around out here."
"18459120","18460080"," CF, CVX."
"18460900","18465480"," If you guys haven't heard already, I want you guys for the weekends on a way to go to the"
"18465480","18466920"," Spot Gamma YouTube channel. "
"18467460","18469400"," S-P-O-T-G-A-M-M-A."
"18469920","18471960"," I want you to go to the newest video that they released."
"18473780","18479380"," And I want you to watch the latest video before Sunday. "
"18480620","18482500"," And watch the entire thing from start to finish."
"18483240","18484540"," Take your time with it."
"18484720","18491460"," If there's anything you don't understand, just keep listening because Brent tries to explain in"
"18491460","18494620"," basic terms what Darius is trying to say. "
"18499800","18506620"," And it gives a macro perspective to why certain things haven't been happening in the market."
"18508540","18510800"," Why we haven't had a VANA rally."
"18512540","18515500"," And just so you get a macro view of what to expect this year. "
"18516200","18517300"," You can mark down an encounter."
"18517540","18519720"," I think this part's not from that video."
"18520220","18522740"," I've got some calendar dates for you guys when they expected. "
"18523560","18525700"," I'll get that stuff posted, but there's a calendar date."
"18526220","18526760"," What's expected."
"18528640","18530220"," Or when rate hikes are expected. "
"18530580","18532700"," So you guys have dates that you can look for."
"18532840","18534920"," For us trading up and then trading down."
"18536120","18537940"," Where the capitulation moves are in the market. "
"18537940","18540400"," Why the bulls keep buying dips."
"18541340","18545760"," But it's a specific kind of bull buying dips and not the market buying dips."
"18550670","18552110"," Why there's no liquidity. "
"18553350","18556790"," Why we're not getting prints off of a hundred point moves in a day, right?"
"18557570","18558870"," And we're moving up from what?"
"18559450","18561750"," 426 this morning to 438."
"18563430","18570830"," You guys should be rich under normal circumstances right now."
"18572810","18576890"," 8,000% these moves, but there's no liquidity in the market right now. "
"18577070","18582210"," So it's the wrong people making the stock price go up and down right now."
"18585070","18586210"," Lots of short covering."
"18589430","18591150"," But not a lot of bid in the market. "
"18598530","18599850"," You could almost call it fake."
"18602070","18606250"," So at 438, 38, still looking for that tag of."
"18606670","18613790"," We might get here we go here's some maybe is affirmed up for 40.36. Next price target. "
"18631140","18633220"," I think it's the index macro case study."
"18635940","18636460"," And."
"18638120","18641300"," Yeah, so I've so when we had a we had a moment last summer. "
"18642380","18645380"," Last June, I think where I bought VIX futures."
"18646440","18647480"," Ended up buying like."
"18648920","18650340"," I bought like. "
"18651100","18654400"," I bought a bunch of stuff that was two years out."
"18657120","18659600"," For a market crash to scenario."
"18660300","18661380"," It's really weird to there. "
"18661640","18663160"," You'll notice how JPM."
"18664460","18666940"," Peaches the market isn't the best way to hedge the market."
"18667540","18669300"," But they're just so used to it. "
"18669380","18669900"," That's what they do."
"18669900","18671760"," It's cost of them doing business."
"18672480","18673020"," They don't care. "
"18674200","18677700"," You'll see our arguments against trades like what you just saw with spy."
"18678360","18679980"," But there are better trades to make."
"18681040","18683160"," So there's a bank to these things. "
"18684880","18686300"," Typically, they're just simpler."
"18694170","18695230"," The men to protect."
"18695430","18697290"," They're meant to protect against market crash. "
"18698510","18699950"," And you can roll them every quarter."
"18702650","18704950"," Or at moments where there's, you know, fair in the market."
"18706570","18715150"," Have some resistance above here for 38.90. More right where we are for 3841. "
"18723150","18724970"," So hope you guys are able to make some money today."

"19005750","19010010"," If I can still have to run a live stream test in discord. "
"19010650","19014710"," I have to pay for some like I have to pay for like the 1080p or some and then I'm"
"19014710","19019430"," going to run a test stream in there and time it on a monitor and see if the delay is"
"19019430","19021030"," more than it is on YouTube."
"19021690","19028370"," If there's too much delay in discord, what I'll do is I'll just every morning post a private stream"
"19028370","19033930"," link in the discord so that you guys can go to the discord every morning and meet up."
"19034250","19038590"," You'll have a link and it'll just be a private stream for you guys direct on YouTube. "
"19039330","19042510"," So we'll and not anybody's you can just access it off the street."
"19043350","19045890"," The sub will become semi private at some point."
"19046230","19049270"," It's not that I'm going to charge ever for that for that semi private. "
"19049270","19054010"," But I want you guys to have a place you feel comfortable and I want people to kind of get"
"19054010","19058810"," here slowly over time rather than just having everybody off the street getting in here or whatever."
"19059450","19062430"," We don't want to have like getting trolled that kind of stuff over time."
"19063530","19065170"," We want to be a positive place. "
"19065570","19067250"," We want people to we're here to make money."
"19067250","19069430"," Remember at the end of the day, right?"
"19069850","19071510"," We're not trying to take each other's money."
"19071510","19072850"," We're trying to take the banks money. "
"19072850","19073510"," That is the truth."
"19074150","19077630"," And oftentimes you'll see bulls and bears fight with each other."
"19077810","19082010"," You'll see me even I've got a ship posting handle on Twitter and I'll make fun of bulls and bears. "
"19083030","19086790"," And but the reality is in the background when it comes to making money."
"19087230","19089990"," It is important for us to be making money."
"19090170","19092430"," It is important for us to team up against the banks. "
"19092870","19094070"," They do that against us."
"19094830","19097410"," They make us the bag holders in the way up and the way down."
"19098230","19099670"," We are trading higher now. "
"19099750","19101090"," We're at 438 78."
"19101850","19103190"," We're looking to get up there, right?"
"19103690","19106610"," I want to see us get up there and hit tag that 440 in the bell."
"19107470","19110150"," Kind of promised you guys that into the close here. "
"19110190","19113410"," We're at 439 10 just striking a pin above."
"19114530","19116470"," Can we make 440 at the end of the day?"
"19116550","19116970"," I'm not sure."
"19117490","19119950"," Be careful as we head into this last 15 minutes. "
"19120190","19121750"," You know how they like to do it sometimes."
"19122290","19123990"," I say take your money and run."
"19124310","19127050"," Sometimes the banks the last few minutes will take your money. "
"19127770","19128650"," So there's no problem."
"19128890","19131550"," There's no there's no shame in taking profit off the table."
"19132030","19133590"," If you've traded this next run up here. "
"19134590","19139350"," Even if you missed that last dollar or two into the close, but that's just me, right?"
"19139770","19142210"," And you guys want to leave a little bit on into the close for 440."
"19142690","19146970"," I understand and know you shouldn't be buying calls for Monday right here."
"19147190","19150470"," You shouldn't buying calls for Monday at the bottom at 930. "
"19150470","19154330"," Or once again, earlier at 231."
"19155270","19157530"," Also remember, if you are a bull, right?"
"19157730","19160970"," Look at the structure right now, even if we are bullish on Monday."
"19161470","19166130"," Remember how we always like to come back and retest on the next trading day?"
"19166690","19168490"," We'll retest 432 and run higher. "
"19169650","19172830"," Think about the two days that we have off in your theta burn."
"19173410","19177590"," I will look real quick on the close."
"19177590","19179630"," I'm going to have a fact that I'm going to close a call out right now. "
"19180590","19181830"," Give me just a second here."
"19186460","19187720"," Close me a call out."
"19190020","19191380"," Come on out with this limit price. "
"19205300","19206400"," Just a second here."
"19206460","19207780"," I'm going to close my own stuff out here."
"19223120","19223720"," All right. "
"19224020","19226360"," So I am out of all my longs."
"19242010","19245810"," So I'm trying to take a look at this chart here and see what's going on."
"19245810","19248510"," What I will do is into the close. "
"19248810","19254830"," I'm going to stick around until 4.15. If I see any large sweeps coming in, we'll pay attention to"
"19254830","19261150"," them because if there's an opportunity to go long into Monday, there's a fair chance that at the"
"19261150","19264310"," bell will trade options to lose a little bit of value."
"19264750","19269250"," So if I can close my lungs out here, if I can end up taking along at the fifth, 4 "
"19269250","19272570",".15, like 4.10, 4.15, take along on the spy."
"19273010","19274610"," If I see anything crazy out there. "
"19274610","19278890"," There is some, I see NVIDIA, what is this?"
"19279030","19281850"," NVIDIA January 20th, 225."
"19282250","19282610"," Oh, wait a minute."
"19282690","19283310"," I've got the strong here. "
"19284950","19285510"," Yeah."
"19285950","19288850"," NVIDIA January 20th, 225 C."
"19289670","19291090"," It's for $1.3 million."

"19295250","19299690"," XLV February 4th, 130 P, $480,000."
"19300330","19301750"," This is a nice call to see right here."
"19302210","19303530"," It's only into today though, right?"
"19303530","19311750"," It's a spy January 28th, 435 C for $2.9 million. "
"19312970","19314050"," Two of them, right?"
"19314690","19317350"," A block and a sweep in the expire today."
"19317970","19319330"," Expire today."
"19319990","19323250"," 435 C expiring today for $5 million. "
"19324630","19326810"," Into the bell right here."
"19328290","19332510"," They want to make sure that they close in the money on their calls."
"19334270","19337430"," Someone wants to close it out strong here. "
"19338510","19344170"," More January 28th, 436 C for $351,000."
"19345390","19355210"," Looking at some puts coming in February 18th, XLB, 80 P, $120,000, XBI February 4th, 80 AP,"
"19355670","19356510"," $237."
"19357150","19358670"," You get some bears loading up right here. "
"19358990","19362330"," You get some bulls hoping that we close strong into the bell here."
"19362670","19367910"," You have $5 million ensuring that we close nice and strong into this bell."
"19368230","19370610"," We could have a ripper for the next five minutes into the close. "
"19371090","19371830"," Next 10 minutes."
"19372270","19374310"," Basically have $5 million coming in."
"19375030","19375810"," $5 million. "
"19376030","19379590"," Yeah, excuse me, $3 million on the spy in total."
"19379590","19384590"," So $3 million and $351,000 on the spy."
"19385290","19389510"," All geared towards it closing strong and green on this Friday. "
"19391110","19391790"," Bang."
"19392190","19397730"," January 28th, today, Amazon, 28, 25 calls on Amazon."
"19398990","19401770"," $855,000 expires today. "
"19403170","19407090"," All it's ensuring is that we close strong and green into this bell."
"19407090","19410270"," We're now at 440, 73 into the bell."
"19410770","19413270"," We've got 10 minutes left to this bell till it ends. "
"19413490","19416210"," Let's see how high we can go into this close."
"19417850","19418750"," That's a lot of money."
"19418930","19421490"," $5 million to ensure that we close green is pretty good. "
"19422610","19424710"," We're pretty excited with this last 10 minutes."
"19424890","19427470"," Could be some money to be made here in this last 10 minutes."
"19428170","19434230"," Real quick, we've got another call expiring today on IWM, 193 C, $231,000. "
"19435010","19438590"," So we most certainly are trying to make this close worth it."
"19438890","19440530"," We can get prints into this bell."
"19441070","19443550"," 440.80 currently on the spy. "
"19444490","19448150"," Big money ensuring that we do not sell off into this bell."
"19448470","19450270"," We close nice and strong today."
"19451150","19452330"," It is critical, too. "
"19452830","19457250"," A bull will tell you that if we close above this, 440.82 is a very bullish sign."
"19457710","19460950"," We were trading this week within this trading range of 444."
"19461590","19464810"," We did break hot or we should be breaking hot. "
"19464910","19474870"," If we can break the high on Thursday was 441.61. If we can close higher than 441.61,"
"19475490","19477730"," it would be a bullish end to the week."
"19478730","19481370"," I also want you to know that we are at the end of the month."
"19482090","19486750"," And so for us to close on a green month, we take a look back behind. "
"19487070","19489890"," We've got one more trading day, Monday, the 31st."
"19489890","19496590"," One other note to consider would be that we are for us to close green, right?"
"19498050","19502930"," January 31st, we close at 479 on December, right?"
"19503890","19505690"," So 479 is right around there."
"19506030","19510630"," For us to close the month out green, we would have to trade higher than 479, right?"
"19510850","19516570"," 478, excuse me, 480 to have a green month to close this month out green. "
"19517910","19521670"," So you'd have through the weekend, into the close on to Monday."
"19522090","19527530"," You want to hope in a prayer play, buy yourself some 480 C for expiring on Monday."
"19528110","19529390"," I bet those costs like a penny. "
"19530610","19533010"," Talk about a talk about tail play."
"19534330","19535350"," Tail play."
"19536250","19545310"," Watching more calls come in for spy January 31st, 438 C, $248,000. "
"19545310","19552990"," Also watching spy calls come in February 4th, 440 C for $1.3 million, outstanding."
"19554230","19555650"," The bulls are stepping up."
"19556330","19560130"," And when they start to see calls like this come in, they want to put their money down and take"
"19560130","19564090"," that gamble and trade that we trade higher to have our vanity trade in the next week. "
"19565990","19569870"," Spy February 4th, 440 C, $1.3 million."
"19570590","19574990"," Each one of those costs $6.48. Hello, ladies."
"19575650","19581250"," Now we look at spy February 4th, 440 C, $826,000. "
"19581990","19586290"," So there is a bet coming into next week us going up in this market."
"19586730","19589630"," There are betters coming in saying, give me that vanity trade."
"19589910","19593990"," We're not going to close this low into next week, especially not an end of month. "
"19594250","19595650"," We want some window dressing."
"19595650","19598010"," Hedge funds are going to give us the window dressing."
"19598430","19599630"," I'm slapping my money down. "
"19599970","19605930"," Here's a bunch of money, $900,000 right on February 4th, 440 C."
"19606510","19611410"," And then the other one was $1.3 million February 4th, 440 C."
"19612310","19613550"," Those are the big boys."
"19613810","19615270"," Everything else is expiring today."
"19616010","19622550"," But those two right there before that bell are betting on us trading at or above 440 into the 4th"
"19622550","19623170"," of February. "
"19633640","19635200"," Zero chance of a green month."
"19636020","19640440"," So we're hearing that if you're going to put the window dressing on for this month, it's going to"
"19640440","19642560"," be some cheap flowers."
"19643320","19646980"," It's going to be carnations from the guy selling them out of a bucket on the street corner. "
"19647380","19650480"," You're not getting the full dress in this year or this month."
"19650880","19651520"," Sorry, boys."
"19654240","19658860"," If you're going to buy some put spreads for Monday, right, or let's say you buy some put spreads"
"19658860","19660060"," February 18th, right?"
"19660460","19669900"," Let's look at what to $480 calls for Monday expiry costs. "
"19670160","19670880"," Leaving on the radar."
"19671660","19672460"," I have no idea."
"19696340","19697140"," Yeah, look at it. "
"19697220","19697740"," So ready?"
"19698080","19699900"," So 480 calls are one penny."
"19700180","19700960"," You don't even have to buy those."
"19701200","19706140"," Just buy like 450 Cs. "
"19706140","19707920"," There are 450."
"19708100","19708660"," Oh, here we go."
"19709120","19709880"," Just the heads up. "
"19710060","19710180"," Okay."
"19710860","19713740"," You've got our first for Monday."
"19713780","19716280"," You've got 120,000 calls. "
"19717460","19718700"," That's pretty substantial."
"19719360","19721380"," 440 C for Monday."
"19721560","19723780"," There's large interest in those contracts. "
"19726960","19727520"," Yeah."
"19727560","19732700"," So you got like a you get like a four 48 like 65 cents or something waiting till after the"
"19732700","19732960"," bell."
"19733720","19736460"," There could be a there could be a pullback on Monday. "
"19736660","19740640"," Just take close that squeeze before heading up on Monday."
"19741200","19744620"," But it does look like the the bulls think we're heading up on Monday."
"19744660","19745740"," Do you want to give you a heads up on that?"
"19745800","19746000"," Okay. "
"19746480","19748340"," But the bulls do think we're going up on Monday."
"19748800","19751760"," We got some cues calls coming in February 4th."
"19752480","19753280"," 353 C."
"19754860","19761380"," $267,000, but we do have 121,000 contracts on January 31. "
"19761380","19764000"," Spy calls at 440 C."
"19766730","19770010"," IWM calls coming in just for the bell January 28th expire."
"19770210","19771970"," That's today 189 C."
"19772630","19774070"," $509,000."
"19776290","19777850"," 440 Cs for Monday. "
"19778270","19779550"," Very expensive for bucks."
"19780890","19783870"," The 450 C for Monday is 37 cents."
"19784450","19786750"," They might not make money with the theta burn. "
"19787010","19789130"," The 448 look a little bit better."
"19789290","19790390"," They're 69 cents."
"19790390","19792570"," And I might wait until. "
"19793330","19795590"," I might wait until after the bell."
"19796490","19800290"," Apple calls January 20th, 200 C."
"19800870","19801350"," Whoo."
"19802090","19803190"," Apple calls. "
"19804310","19807690"," But scratch that that's January 20th, 2023."
"19808110","19815710"," So you have Apple calls January 20th, 2023, 200 C, $582,000."
"19816230","19817870"," We have Apple calls. "
"19817870","19823030"," Our February 4th, 175 C for $84,000."
"19826180","19830200"," We're currently at 441.31. Do we get 446?"
"19830660","19831740"," I'm going to give a shout out earlier."
"19832320","19834760"," Instead, do we get 446 into the bell today?"
"19838410","19839410"," We'll wait and see. "
"19840690","19842370"," We get the gap up on Monday."
"19842830","19844930"," But bulls getting their gap up come Monday."
"19846790","19849510"," And if they gap up, where do they gap up to?"
"19849510","19851970"," It looked like resistance this week was at 444. "
"19852610","19857970"," So you need a higher you need a gap up higher than 444 to make it count unless you take"
"19857970","19859810"," your money and run coming into."
"19861130","19862250"," Coming into Monday."
"19863030","19870570"," Yeah, the high this past week was 444.04. It would it would make in matter of fact, it would"
"19870570","19871650"," give us a green week. "
"19872110","19873590"," If we close there today."
"19874230","19876110"," We close at 444 today."
"19876290","19877630"," You'd exinate this entire week. "
"19878130","19879770"," You'd make this week close green."
"19881290","19883770"," We have two minutes left to squeeze that much higher."
"19891690","19892870"," Can we do it?"
"19895560","19903300"," The high of this past week, 444.04. Come on, bulls. "

"19942410","19944210"," It would be hilarious if we traded up. "
"19944990","19946710"," Hilarious if we close the month on green."
"19946830","19947350"," I'll give you that."
"19947510","19949730"," If we close the month green, it would be hilarious. "
"19951050","19951790"," Not going to lie."

"19961810","19964070"," Just climbing the wall of worry."
"19964090","19965930"," Shorts getting out of their shorts here."
"19966170","19967850"," This is where I'm going to take my put spread. "
"19972080","19973440"," Get it, get it, get it."
"19976020","19977140"," You might put spread."
"19983200","19984040"," Come on now. "
"19985020","19986120"," You might put spread."

"20002880","20003320"," I like it."
"20003320","20004260"," I like seeing it."
"20005980","20007860"," Nice short covering over the weekend. "
"20008840","20015120"," I'm going to watch to see what comes in after the bell between 4 p.m. and 415."
"20015820","20017820"," I want to see if there's anything else happening here."
"20019320","20020340"," Great end of the day. "
"20020820","20024660"," You know, whoever called that earlier, we are damn sure closer to 446."

"20042440","20042880"," Really?"
"20043620","20044980"," You took that bet right at the bell?"
"20045800","20047220"," You should wait at least 15 minutes. "
"20047700","20049360"," It should cool off here for a little bit."
"20050340","20052800"," It should cool off a little bit after the bell."
"20053400","20056500"," When liquidity gets low, there's not as much demand for calls. "
"20057580","20058880"," One who took that trade."
"20060980","20062580"," That's a crazy trade right after the bell."
"20063960","20065880"," You should see calls cool off a little bit. "
"20066260","20070280"," If you want to stay long, usually what you do is you sell right at the bell."
"20070880","20072980"," And then you give it another 10, 5 to 15 minutes."
"20073220","20074840"," Let the call prices come down a little bit. "
"20075500","20077680"," Then re-enter again if you want to stay long until Monday."

"20116520","20118820"," We're here mostly Monday through Friday unless I go skiing."
"20118820","20121360"," Or my internet goes down or anything crazy."
"20121380","20122860"," It's very rare that it does happen. "
"20123360","20127880"," We do trade live every day from the beginning of the morning until the end of the day."
"20128380","20132480"," We're definitely here most of the day for key pivots."
"20133420","20137800"," We had some great trading today and I look forward to trading with you on Monday. "
"20138860","20141260"," Let me know down in the chat box."
"20141400","20146040"," Let me know if you are bullish into Monday or if you're bearish into Monday."
"20146620","20149320"," Or if you think we get the vanity trade straight to all-time highs. "
"20149800","20151060"," As we know, it wouldn't be all-time highs."
"20151180","20152560"," It would be like 460 or something."
"20153880","20157040"," The vanity trade should go if you believe in the vanity trade. "
"20158460","20165520"," It should go to 467.55. That's what the vanity trade would take us to."
"20168880","20172980"," Otherwise, we have not broken above resistance at 443."
"20172980","20175980"," 444.11 yet. "
"20176820","20181100"," It would really have liked to have seen that today at close higher on the week."
"20181740","20182960"," We didn't get that."
"20183120","20188400"," We did get some positive notes for the bulls. "
"20189120","20195920"," It would be our second low of the day was higher than the previous days low."
"20196720","20200280"," We did close higher than yesterday's high, which is positive."
"20200280","20201660"," It's more neutral to positive. "
"20205220","20209120"," It is neutral to positive, but it's still a good day for the bulls."
"20209400","20213000"," It does look like a short short covering operation to close to me."
"20213420","20215380"," But I know there are some bulls out there. "
"20215640","20218720"," I think we can trade higher into our gap up even into Monday."
"20219160","20227880"," There is some resistance above on Monday, like 448.29. We can encounter into Monday's open."
"20227880","20229820"," This is a good possibility of a gap up on Monday. "
"20231100","20236320"," If we don't gap up on Monday, look for cash back down below, and then maybe it will take it"
"20236320","20236900"," higher there."
"20245980","20247840"," Bears are going to crush the bulls on Monday."
"20251140","20252500"," Fuck your bear market. "
"20253320","20255000"," I understand the failing."
"20255660","20256700"," I get the failing."
"20257680","20261640"," Only thing I'm looking for right now, well, I'm trading longs too, but the only thing I'm looking"
"20261640","20263200"," for right now is entry into short. "
"20263200","20270780"," If we can get the VIX down, if we can get high enough to get short again, it makes it"
"20270780","20270980"," cheaper."
"20271760","20274400"," I don't want to be buying puts that are ridiculously expensive."
"20276660","20278140"," Puts are too expensive. "
"20279560","20281040"," The VIX is 2DM high."
"20282160","20283640"," Look at that beautiful chart right there."
"20284540","20285360"," That's gorgeous. "
"20288140","20290060"," Look at that close right there."
"20290060","20292700"," Let's see if we can show it to you real quick."
"20293480","20297900"," I got to stick around because I got to see what shenanigans get pulled in the after hours. "
"20298300","20299960"," Look at that beautiful move right there."
"20300760","20301500"," Just epic."
"20302940","20304320"," Look at that into the close. "
"20306640","20308340"," See that in the close is beautiful."
"20312740","20319160"," And I want you to see these people taking on more puts as we head up into this close right"
"20319160","20319400"," here."
"20320640","20323860"," I want you to see that it's not just unbridled call buying. "
"20328600","20329340"," All right."
"20329500","20330340"," Good job today, guys."
"20330720","20333760"," I hope you all have a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful weekend. "
"20341450","20344370"," Yeah, it doesn't negate the bare thesis."
"20345110","20347430"," You have to trade higher to trade down."
"20348990","20352030"," You should expect to have these moves up. "
"20352910","20357170"," You can't get bullish until you break above the major resistance."
"20357930","20359170"," We already know where that's at."
"20359310","20360330"," It's at 468. "
"20361850","20362370"," 46850."
"20363450","20364870"," That is even the bare thesis."
"20365130","20368110"," Actually, it's all time high is when you break bare thesis at this point. "
"20368610","20371090"," You are looking for the trade higher though to 467."
"20371810","20373870"," If you are a bull, that's the VANA trade."
"20375090","20379290"," The VANA fuel trade is to 467, 468. "
"20379290","20386090"," If you think we go higher into that move, you actually want to be seeing that by Monday, possibly"
"20386090","20386490"," Tuesday."
"20387330","20394030"," But literally, that's what you would want to see is a trade up to 470ish, 468ish between now and"
"20394030","20394890"," Tuesday or Wednesday."
"20396170","20396790"," All right. "
"20396890","20397970"," You guys all have a wonderful weekend."
"20398690","20400070"," I will catch up with you soon."
"20406140","20408060"," And I will talk to you guys here shortly. "
"20411910","20414490"," What I'll do is I'll leave the stream up."
"20417050","20417830"," Hold on here."
"20419880","20420580"," What happened here?"
"20420720","20421160"," What did I press?"
"20422740","20427500"," What I'll leave you guys with is the stream up until 415. "
"20427540","20430660"," And if I see anything that I should post, I will."
"20432040","20437200"," UVXY February 11th, 14 P, $105,000."
"20438800","20442180"," UVXY puts February 11th, 14 P."
"20442880","20445600"," I don't know why I've got that coming up. "
"20456860","20458320"," You got to love Microsoft."
"20464780","20467220"," No idea what that is."
"20469170","20470610"," I'm planning with the chance of me balls. "
"20475490","20477130"," So I'll stick around here next few minutes."
"20477290","20481170"," We've got seven minutes left to the hour or to the trading day."
"20481750","20484790"," We always want to see if anybody sneaks in anything we haven't seen. "
"20486570","20487610"," For a trade hire."
"20487890","20493030"," It would be hilarious if we traded up to 480 on Monday for window dressing."
"20494570","20495530"," Kid you not. "
"20499580","20501240"," So, Mel, what did you see?"
"20507550","20510010"," You see inputs flow into the spy right now?"
"20519200","20519840"," Goddamn it."
"20520980","20522220"," Five villains to 18."
"20530120","20531540"," Hey, Mero, have a great weekend. "
"20532780","20533980"," You guys all have a great day."
"20536780","20537260"," Yeah."
"20538000","20539140"," Yeah, you know Mero?"
"20541680","20544460"," I'm at that point as well with the Windows 7, bro. "
"20546160","20549100"," I was thinking about switching to a Linux setup."
"20550180","20552380"," And then I thought about Windows 7 as well."
"20556290","20563430"," Okay, why is Windows options profit calculator is wrong because you're not because of interest and"
"20563430","20563670"," IV?"
"20569070","20571730"," I agree with you, Mero, 100%. "
"20573150","20576070"," I tried to I tried to strip this computer down."
"20576530","20580650"," There's a whole bunch of shit that Windows won't let me remove."
"20581410","20586430"," And then it runs it runs antivirus in the background right in the middle of a stream. "
"20588250","20589330"," Like Windows Defender."
"20589990","20590970"," You can't turn it off."
"20591750","20592690"," And it's street area. "
"20593090","20596130"," Like certain moments of the day, no matter what it's going to."
"20596390","20598650"," I guess I can I can try to find a virus program."
"20599350","20600330"," That's very lightweight. "
"20601190","20602790"," And it shuts off Windows Defender."
"20614380","20615300"," It's a disaster."
"20615620","20620980"," I blow my blows my mind forced updates through the middle of trading. "
"20621600","20623540"," I've had forced updates on Windows 11."
"20623680","20629080"," My other my other machine has has done forced updates on me."
"20629540","20630800"," Just middle of the day trading. "
"20631880","20632560"," Fuck you."
"20632740","20633040"," Fuck you."
"20633080","20633420"," Fuck you. "
"20633420","20634600"," I'm like what?"

"20670880","20672380"," It's not fully accessible."
"20675280","20681200"," I can't trade, well I used to trade on Apple, but Apple doesn't interface well with a lot of what"
"20681200","20681580"," I use."
"20683380","20686640"," So I have to use a Windows based system to be able to get everything. "
"20688220","20693000"," Apple is getting better, but they sucked for a long time, so everything I've got is based around"
"20693000","20696440"," Android and Windows due to it."
"20700160","20705920"," Nice little dip coming in here, last four minutes of the trading day, so if you wanted to take long"
"20705920","20712660"," into Monday, just wait for that nice little dip, wait for some of that premium to burn off."
"20719320","20720920"," Yeah and Bunto is nice too. "
"20726080","20729460"," Joe Donor runs a bunch of stuff off servers, two off some blade servers."
"20738240","20739920"," Let's see what that looks like right there."
"20744400","20754360"," Yeah I tried to run, I tried to jack up two computers together with"
"20754360","20758820"," an Elgato video card, and it's not doing so well. "
"20762260","20772200"," It's not coping, but the real problem, I'm trying to ram server 2000 RCS, did not mess with latest"
"20772200","20772860"," Windows, yeah."

"20783980","20784360"," down."
"20786680","20796360"," SSDS, yeah in 2007, dude, when I made the mistake, I had a couple other computers that I went from"
"20796360","20802320"," 2007 to like 2008 or 2010 or something, and I got fucked at that point. "
"20803440","20812500"," We are watching lots of dark pool buying of spy and QQQ's came in just before the bell, substantial"
"20812500","20820960"," amount of dark pool buying after the bell or just before the bell, QQQ's spy could make for a nice,"
