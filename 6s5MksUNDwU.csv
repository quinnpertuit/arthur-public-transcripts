"0","290"," session."
"670","3250"," Here are three movers that we are watching for you."
"3510","7870"," One of the busiest days of earnings season, Honeywell, Merc, Shell, Deutsche Bank, and a whole lot"
"7870","8850"," more all reporting results. "
"8970","10930"," We're going to break it down for you this hour."
"11210","15570"," We're closely watching regional banks after coming up their biggest one-day percentage drop since"
"15570","16510"," March of last year."
"16890","20090"," New York Community Bank Corps down big again today. "
"20390","25090"," Moody's putting it on review for a downgrade after the company posted a surprise loss, cut its"
"25090","29730"," dividend, stock lost more than 30% yesterday down another 10% right now."
"29750","31930"," And big check and focus yet again."
"32310","37670"," Specifically, Apple, Amazon, and Meta, all three megacap names are higher ahead of their earnings"
"37670","38470"," after the belt today. "
"38610","40830"," We're going to get you ready for Apple in just a moment."
"41090","44610"," You can probably see equities reacting to some ISM data."
"44830","45430"," Let's get to Rick Stanton. "
"45750","46030"," Hey, Rick."
"47330","48070"," Yes, boy."
"48210","49390"," There's a lot going on here. "
"49530","55810"," First, let's start quickly with construction spending for December up 9% just the best since"
"55810","57510"," October of last year."
"57830","58710"," Now, let's get into it."
"58910","68830"," ISM manufacturing, the headline number 49.1, which means that is 15 consecutive months below 50. "
"69350","70230"," But here's the oddity."
"70570","76070"," 49.1 still is the best level since October 22 and it was 50."
"76710","79570"," That's how weak it has been in manufacturing. "
"80090","81630"," Okay, prices paid."
"82050","83010"," This is not good."
"83370","85690"," And this is what the markets are going to pay attention to. "
"85930","93470"," Prices paid for January expected to be 46.9. And that would have been, what, 9 in a row below"
"93470","95850"," 50, some good celebration there."
"95990","103310"," But it popped all the way up to 52.9. 52.9. That's the highest prices paid since April of"
"103310","103930"," last year."
"104390","109110"," And you want to keep an eye on that one 52.5 on new orders. "
"109110","110770"," That is a big surprise."
"110870","114850"," We had 17 consecutive below 50s, not anymore."
"115410","119150"," So 52.5, that's the best since May of 2022. "
"119610","121630"," And finally, employment."
"121910","124310"," And this is important because we have the big number tomorrow."
"124650","125630"," Jobs, jobs, jobs. "
"126330","132090"," 47.1, 47.1. That means the fourth consecutive month under 50."
"133230","134430"," 47.1 is the best."
"134790","144230"," Well, just since December, when it was 48.1, but that gets downgraded to 47.5, but still 47.1"
"144230","145290"," is comping to that. "
"145610","151290"," And it really is something incredible to watch to see that prices paid jumped the way it has."
"151650","154710"," I know it's not the favorite inflation indicator, nor is CPI."
"155490","160550"," But there are some metrics outside of PCE that are running a bit warmer than the Fed made. "
"161670","163670"," Yeah, so we'll be watching it."
"163790","168210"," Thank you, Rick Santelli, with better numbers there, pretty much across the board on manufacturing"
"168210","169690"," and prices paid."
"170310","173790"," The other data we got today, jobless claims, they did tick up last week. "
"173990","175690"," 224,000 was the total."
"176030","177990"," So it was about 12k more than expected."
"178750","181730"," We're continuing to watch that before we moving average moves up to 208. "
"181890","184770"," Nothing super worrisome there in terms of layoffs or stress."
"185270","191670"," But we watched the trend moving up is not exactly what you would want to see in a good economy."
"192250","193650"," But we're still at super low numbers. "
"193830","196710"," The only other one I would mention is we got the the challenger, Greg."
"196990","200570"," I love all the guys just a layoff from a private sector report."
"201310","202710"," I've been burning the catalytic. "
"202710","203030"," I'm crazy."
"203410","205470"," I went back at 630 to support it."
"205510","212530"," We'll back up at eight 30 percent increase from the cuts announced a month prior in December. "
"213410","215090"," Obviously, that was during the holiday season."
"215090","220730"," And they also said it was the highest number of job cuts announced in a January since January 2009."
"222170","227490"," As far as the reason, they quote mostly cost cutting, which is something we followed from a lot of"
"227490","227910"," tech companies. "
"228050","234130"," Any of you guys that follow any of those put spreads too major prints, you have to close any of"
"234130","234530"," those spreads."
"234530","240970"," If any of you guys had those out there becomes more widely adopted and potentially fits into the"
"240970","244630"," cost cutting narrative and the productivity narrative as a potential job replacement."
"244810","249690"," It's surprising to me given everything we've heard thus far in terms of the impact of AI and"
"249690","252510"," productivity that it would already be replacing jobs. "
"252910","254730"," We actually would take a little."
"254870","255029"," Yeah."
"255329","259850"," I mean, there's a big debate about whether it's just supply chain healing and full employment or if"
"259850","262910"," it's already getting in the mix, we talked to Lisa Sue yesterday. "
"262910","263750"," She said it's happening."
"264130","265270"," She says it's happening."
"265390","265850"," It is happening even at the margin. "
"266890","269810"," That it's that it's happening and they're already starting to replace the back office."
"269990","273930"," They don't think I mean companies like IBM and others won't say it's going to be a net job loser."
"273970","278370"," They're going to use that growth and they're going to reskill and train people. "
"278770","281290"," But it's something to watch, I think, in the macro data."
"281510","283530"," That's the first time I've seen that in a release like this."
"283530","284170"," Yeah, no, it's notable. "
"284590","284930"," It's notable."
"285530","288510"," And then there's the Fed and now we're contemplating what comes next."
"288990","293150"," Obviously, the money line from Powell yesterday came about a half an hour into the news conference"
"293150","294550"," where he talked about March. "
"294650","294950"," Listen."
"297210","303990"," Based on the meeting today, I would tell you that I don't think it's likely that the committee will"
"303990","309050"," reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to do."
"311090","313910"," How do you like that year over year inflation, huh?"
"314390","315530"," How do you like them apples?"
"320070","323930"," You would call the base case. "
"326090","330310"," That kind of took March more off the table, at least for the markets."
"330570","335430"," The odds went down to like 30% from 60% for the March off the table for me months"
"335430","335810"," ago."
"335930","336890"," Yeah, I thought it was too soon. "
"337210","338230"," But the economy is good."
"338550","340550"," They want more evidence."
"341170","347650"," Just heads up out there that yellow line that you see these are auto pivot levels that we are"
"347650","349690"," launching here in the next day or so. "
"349930","351490"," So that yellow line right there."
"351490","354210"," I want to show you guys something here really quick."
"355310","363850"," I've got these auto pivot levels now for the stream here and you're going to get access to them. "
"364390","373950"," So I remember we've been like, remember we've been Oh, I'll drop something for you."
"374070","375910"," I'll drop something for you this morning."
"377050","377990"," Hold on here. "
"379530","382930"," So you guys, some of you guys have been around here since day one, right?"
"388450","395730"," You know, there was a time when I was told that people were paying money for pivots every day."
"396670","398070"," Five bucks, 10 bucks."
"398930","403970"," It wasn't a grifter scam or anything, but people had been to it with charge and get levels like"
"403970","405270"," five, 10 bucks, something like that. "
"406070","411070"," And so we decided to put out a handle called at Captain's Alpha."
"412050","416530"," And every morning we post, we post pivot points for, I think, seven tickers."
"418370","427410"," And you know, my daughter, my oldest daughter, I taught her how to write gamma models, pivot"
"427410","433890"," tables, Excel spreadsheets, pull the data from the CMO, I'm a CBOE. "
"434590","436130"," And you know what she did?"
"436550","444130"," The past two years, she's been the person that's been pulling and posting those Excel spreadsheets"
"444130","446890"," for you guys every morning."
"447570","454270"," And that led her down a route of wanting to go to school for finance."
"455270","464030"," And you know, this morning, my daughter is at the University of Michigan still in high school,"
"464030","473810"," taking 200 level, 200 level classes at the University of Michigan and working towards still in high"
"473810","474030"," school. "
"474130","475290"," Like this blows my mind."
"475670","482590"," Went through COVID and now she's going to be going to school, you know, at this, it's a, it's a,"
"482670","486890"," it's a, it's a, between public and private, it's like number two research school in the United"
"486890","493570"," States, number three, I think, for public, for public institutions, for public private, number 23,"
"493570","495110"," I think, in the United States."
"496070","499470"," So I want to thank you guys for all these years. "
"501150","502990"," Look at that, baby, look at that, squeeze."
"505210","515990"," And you know what, all that has culminated in, in developing a tool, an indicator that"
"515990","520970"," is going to give pivots for every, every ticker in the stock market."
"521730","526310"," So if you've ever been here since the beginning, wherever it's culminated in that, now that she's"
"526310","531570"," kind of graduating and to do another stuff, she's actually going to help us with this next step in"
"531570","536790"," the process as well, get more involved as she finished, wraps up her high school. "
"536970","541950"," And so this is going to be, it's kind of making me sad because it's extending gains here."
"542070","544090"," So it's currently up around there, it's about five percent."
"544630","549590"," Also just seeing from a statement released now, Petra Basal to cut natural gas prices by two"
"549590","550910"," percent against January. "
"551710","556890"," So the, the idea here though, is that she's not going to have to do that anymore in the morning."
"557670","560170"," And you guys are going to get expanded everything."
"560610","567470"," And so it's just really like just the marking of moments in, in my daughter getting older and then"
"568070","570170"," I was working on this tool with her last night. "
"571150","573470"," And I'm just proud, I guess, you know."
"574430","576350"," So we're on, on to that next step."
"580400","581600"," See you guys here shortly. "
"585460","593200"," Now the reason I'm telling you this too is because I think I have to move the actual level PT."
"593540","595080"," I think this is crowding everything."
"595540","598500"," So I mean like take it to the right or something like that. "
"600000","606140"," And if you guys, you guys are going to put their levels on test like hand, but and I'll talk"
"606140","609640"," about, I'm going to top back into the stream and maybe an hour or two."
"609940","611880"," I got caught up last night."
"612040","616880"," We had some roadblocks in the middle of the night, ended up working until 6.30 this morning, I"
"616880","619900"," think, to try to bypass those roadblocks. "
"621220","627300"," And so this morning I have, I got, I got a sidetracked from finishing the discord."
"628320","633160"," So I still got to get that work done today, but I will try to stop and talk, Tesla, that"
"633160","634020"," kind of stuff with you."
"634400","638080"," Give you guys some kind of an update into what to expect into the weekend, the launch and all that"
"638080","638540"," kind of stuff. "
"638980","645380"," We are, I want you guys to know something today, as of today, we are ready to launch something."
"646620","650260"," Now all the parts are 99% done to launch."
"650620","651660"," I just got to put them all together. "
"652260","654340"," I got like borks breaking his ass in the background."
"654820","656580"," I got cue breaking his ass."
"656780","658140"," Joe donuts breaking his butt. "
"658660","661320"," So we're going to try to get it to you guys today, tomorrow."
"661760","662600"," It's, it's done though."
"662740","663560"," We're, we're launching. "
"664400","666560"," We have all the pieces that we need to get there."
"666760","669400"," So we will have something for you."
"669640","675300"," It's a matter of, it might be a flaming dumpster for a day or two, but there will be some"
"675300","677080"," kind of launch coming up here. "
"677820","681600"," I love all of you out there that have been stuck by Binky."
"682040","683020"," I love you, man."
"683920","687880"," So any guys out there in the background that have been working, I know there are people out there"
"687880","690200"," right now that know that I haven't been sleeping up. "
"690980","692740"," It's hard to explain to some of you guys."
"693280","695880"," I'm like work, I'm literally working right now."
"696420","700280"," I don't know, 20 hour days, not joking. "
"700980","701900"," No cap on that."
"702160","710140"," Like 20 hour days, uh, eating fucking nails and fucking gravel, literally eating nails and gravel"
"710140","714220"," to get this thing done, push it through, come home, all that kind of stuff."
"714800","721060"," Uh, so expect some cool stuff coming down the road, guys, really, truly expect some cool ass shit"
"721060","721840"," coming down the road. "
"722580","724000"," Uh, it's going to be badass."
"724420","724980"," I'm so excited."
"725560","729140"," Uh, I'm so happy excited that it's keeping me just running, running, running. "
"729700","734620"," And some of you out there are, are seeing me on video and private conferencing."
"734620","738820"," So you guys see how, you guys see how rough I look right now."
"738840","739780"," I'm like, frazzled. "
"739880","740840"," I'm not normally like that."
"740960","745440"," So I just want to say thank you to for, uh, bearing with me and, uh, hold my hand as"
"745440","746880"," we, as we cross that finish line."
"747600","749240"," So I'll see you guys here in just a little bit. "
"749260","749480"," Okay."
"754380","755700"," It's going to be hella rad."
"756140","757340"," It's going to be hella rad. "
"757780","759600"," I promise to be so dope."
"764500","765700"," It's going to be so cool."
"766020","768000"," Like you're going to get me in the discord. "
"768200","771380"," Like the discord, do you guys are going to get me in there every day?"
"771880","773820"," Uh, you're going to see me start focusing."
"774240","778340"," One of the coolest parts about this is it frees me up."
"778500","784340"," Like one of the coolest parts I don't talk about, it frees me up a lot that's going to be"
"784340","787320"," launching now is going to free me up, right?"
"788040","789820"," To spend more time with you. "
"790140","796100"," So, and I don't mean on just spy, like spending time with you for big tech, spending time with you"
"796100","802440"," on other indexes, spending time with you on GME and AMC and all this other stuff, you're going to"
"802440","805940"," get more undivided attention from me."
"806060","810540"," You're going to get the hand holding for how to grow accounts, how to build accounts."
"811240","812300"," You're going to get that time. "
"812820","813940"," How do you make your money?"
"814160","814960"," All that kind of stuff."
"815440","820300"," Uh, how I trade spreads, uh, how I view the market, you're going to get more one-on-one from,"
"820300","821540"," uh, from captain through this."
"821540","822440"," It's going to be fucking awesome. "
"823060","824800"," Uh, I'm so excited and stoked."
"825560","827440"," Um, so let's, let's get it on."
"827540","828340"," You guys have a great day. "
"828520","830840"," You saw my post, I hope on Twitter this morning."
"831280","836840"," I told you guys to buy the fucking dip and then, uh, I talked about the expectations personally for"
"836840","837140"," today."
"837380","839120"," I expect this squeeze here. "
"839120","840400"," We have range expansion."
"841020","844520"," We should be going into contraction, but we had an STX buy at the close yesterday."
"844560","848700"," Uh, so that is triggering the subside move into the open this morning. "
"848920","851000"," Dealers, we're basically neutral though."
"851200","855720"," There's no requirement we go higher, uh, or too much higher off this open."
"855900","861700"," I'm not expecting a full-on trend day though, as we come into the, into the close today for this"
"861700","868920"," ER reports, that can trigger, uh, that, that larger expansion to the upside or possibly, uh, if we"
"868920","873320"," get some upside targets hit, we'll possibly swing back down to the downside. "
"874320","876660"," And you've already seen this week, right?"
"876820","881880"," This whole week, uh, basically, uh, move, uh, this whole week was, hey, we ran this all the way up."
"881880","884920"," We've got some great events to take the money and run."
"885080","886880"," You've seen that on ER reports. "
"887340","888400"," You've seen it with the Fed."
"889200","896580"," We will also, at some point today, over the weekend review, uh, uh, the Fed decision, right?"
"896780","898760"," And dude, it was, I was all over that."
"898880","899860"," Should I have that shit all right?"
"900480","905240"," Uh, we got to talk about that again in depth because we have people that have been here since day"
"905240","905620"," one. "
"906000","908300"," We have people that have been here a year."
"908380","911640"," If people have been here two years and people that have been here three years."
"911780","913780"," You have had people that have known me since Wall Street bets. "
"914240","916860"," There are people that have known me here for a week, right?"
"917700","918280"," And or month."
"918940","920960"," And some of you have more information than others."
"921200","922620"," Some of you know a lot about this stuff. "
"923220","926080"," Uh, and you guys, you guys heard it yesterday, right?"
"926680","927200"," Uncertainty."
"927940","931080"," Uh, you guys know that people out there say it's normal."
"931440","932840"," It's rational, right?"
"933040","938900"," The Fed's favorite tool that that, uh, that short term, uh, rate of inflation, but the facts are"
"938900","942920"," that, uh, he is messaging us along the way. "
"943340","949480"," And, uh, he's looking for that, that stability and inflation and not that velocity and inflation."
"949940","956580"," And he is looking at that year over year inflation for when he actually begins to cut rates."
"957480","959080"," Uh, so we'll go over that again this morning. "
"959080","960160"," We'll talk art to that."
"960300","963520"," I don't know if it's this morning, but between now and the weekend, that kind of stuff, we're"
"963520","964500"," probably going to get together."
"964840","969560"," It's not if I can, I would love to get together with you guys over the weekend in the discord. "
"970340","978120"," Um, uh, we have a love to get together with you guys, spend some time outside of market hours to"
"978120","980100"," answer some questions for you, all that kind of stuff."
"980300","981340"," So I'm taking a look at the break."
"981560","982000"," Okay. "
"982700","983960"," I'll see you guys here soon."
"986960","992020"," Speaker, and that's primarily due to the guidance and concerns that the June quarter will be a"
"992020","995260"," little bit worse for smartphones, but Qualcomm blames seasonality."
"995560","995860"," Sarah. "
"996320","997680"," All right, Christina, thank you."
"997680","998460"," I love you, Bork."
"999120","1001780"," We're trying to bring Bork on right now with us. "
"1002080","1005040"," Dude, I tried to pitch Bork the other night."
"1005040","1005800"," You guys wear some crazy."
"1006400","1008460"," I was trying to pitch Bork the other night. "
"1008460","1015200"," I was like, man, I need a partner in crime on live streams and we get along great, right?"
"1015420","1020680"," So I made a whole entire intro for him and pitched it to him at like two o'clock in"
"1020680","1023900"," the morning, two days ago to get him excited to get him on board."
"1024579","1027880"," Uh, so if Bork's here this morning, or not Bork, sorry, trainer podcast."
"1028200","1031599"," I think everybody said Bork, but trainer podcast, I'm actually speaking about. "
"1031960","1034920"," So he's in the, he's in the chat right now."
"1035040","1036660"," So that's all directed towards trainer podcast."
"1037240","1038460"," I love you, trainer podcast. "
"1039160","1044880"," And, uh, and Bork, dude, I said, I pitched trainer podcast, a intro for a live stream."
"1044880","1050280"," And then Bork, I've been trying to pitch him to get more involved in the background as well."
"1052580","1055260"," No, no, Bork, I'm doing the same thing in the background. "
"1058260","1058780"," Absolutely."
"1059800","1062040"," And then we're, we're talking a bunch of other people too."
"1062120","1067860"," We're like trying to roll David AMS and we're talking to the gentleman over at Black Swan earnings. "
"1068440","1070500"," We're, we got, we got all caught."
"1070680","1072460"," I can't tell you everybody we're talking to."
"1072840","1076960"," I can't drop all the public, but it's going to be bad ass. "
"1077160","1082140"," Okay, bad ass career low in the house right now."
"1082200","1082900"," Good morning, Grillo."
"1083480","1085520"," It's going to be, it's going to be bad ass. "
"1086020","1086800"," All right, I'll talk."
"1086940","1087280"," I got to go."
"1087400","1087960"," I got to go. "
"1088360","1089260"," I'll be right back."
"1101210","1103510"," Oh, yeah, breaking news."
"1104210","1110970"," If any of you guys know how I feel about Peloton shares plummet 20% as fitness company gives dismal"
"1110970","1111550"," outlook. "
"1112310","1115850"," Joe Donut, if you're out there right now, what did I say?"
"1116050","1122650"," I will not be happy until sitting on a shelf in a Walmart at the checkout as seen on TV"
"1122650","1129910"," thing on the prior minus 326 BC frame the potential for this category."
"1130290","1134670"," Is it, is it any more important than it was when they say launched a watch category?"
"1135790","1138190"," You know, I think the watch to go really fast."
"1138190","1140650"," I think the vision probably the price point is much higher. "
"1141210","1142670"," I'm sure they're going to talk about it."
"1142710","1144030"," They want to be excited about that category."
"1144030","1148110"," But I think from a stock standpoint, I would say at this point, it's kind of immaterial. "
"1148570","1154030"," What other note, what other note here on the gamma chart for SPX, I'm going to leave this chart"
"1154030","1154670"," right here."
"1155070","1158030"," See where it says 30, 30 minute gamma, just above it."
"1158110","1159570"," This is the gamma flip right here. "
"1160130","1167410"," Okay, you do not, if at any point, you see any kind of selling down here and in more of"
"1167410","1171830"," this kind of stuff, that triggers CTA selling down there."
"1172390","1174830"," Okay, you really want to be seeing this get defended."
"1175150","1178070"," If you're a bull, you need to defend this all day long. "
"1178070","1179190"," That's where you buy the dip."
"1179410","1182850"," Okay, you buy the dip here, buy the dip, buy the dip."
"1183150","1188330"," Whenever you get caught on tops, if you're a bull and you're getting caught on tops, it's because"
"1188330","1192530"," you are not buying these dips here where it feels dangerous. "
"1193030","1200430"," You buy these dips with stops underneath until you're proven wrong and it rejects down here."
"1200490","1203410"," You get your stops on and then you turn into a bear below."
"1203690","1207870"," Okay, and then this is real bear right down here is where you get really bearish down there. "
"1226260","1230020"," You know, all right, I'll say something about Peloton."
"1231740","1233580"," I loved Peloton."
"1234480","1240420"," What pissed me off, we were trained, I was trying to short Peloton on the ground. "
"1241040","1249220"," What really pissed me off was that they had enough many opportunities as the United States reopened"
"1249220","1258980"," to turn that brand into an outdoor brand like buy a manufacturing develop, a manufacturing plant,"
"1259280","1264420"," anything to partner, collaborate with like a bike company."
"1264980","1273060"," I was fully expecting after the reopening to be able to like buy a Peloton, a quality like a giant"
"1273060","1274940"," type bike or something like that."
"1275060","1279340"," It has to be the best, but like not, not a shitty bike, but be able to try. "
"1279600","1287660"," I mean, it was a no brainer for Peloton to make that jump into becoming a reopening outdoor type"
"1287660","1288080"," company."
"1288460","1292320"," And they, in my view, they squandered that that really rode my ass."
"1292500","1297200"," That's why if you want the real reason why I don't like Peloton, I felt like it was a squandered"
"1297200","1297800"," opportunity. "
"1297800","1300920"," It was perfect for the shut downs."
"1301380","1305740"," And it was a perfect tie into a reopening for biking outside."
"1307980","1315500"," Yeah, I was, I was mostly upset that I'm sure that there was a C-suite or a C-suite"
"1315500","1323040"," decision to not reinvest all those gains into the jump to reopening the United States. "
"1323040","1324580"," So I've got nothing for him."
"1324620","1325920"," I got no love for him today."
"1327120","1328760"," And yeah, the subscription thing. "
"1329060","1330520"," Yeah, that's the problem, too."
"1330660","1331660"," I agree with you on that, Bork."
"1336450","1340450"," I got, I got, I got to stop reading the chat because I already know it's going to get freaky. "
"1340850","1342990"," Like, I can't, I think I'm going to be like, I'm not even going to get him."
"1342990","1344590"," I'm just going to sit here and chat out more with you guys."
"1344870","1347190"," I will be right back in the OPEC plus. "
"1353960","1354660"," The NBC."
"1356900","1358520"," Despite the approval of those much."
"1359040","1360000"," Good morning, brother. "
"1360000","1360600"," How are you?"
"1360680","1361840"," Good to see you."
"1361840","1362200"," My man."
"1362440","1363300"," Let's get to Dom Choo. "
"1363420","1364320"," He's been tracking that action."
"1364500","1364780"," Morning, Doc."
"1365000","1368240"," I could buy the rumor, sell the news kind of situation, right?"
"1368360","1371700"," So remember at the heights that we saw running into the ETF approval. "
"1372100","1381440"," Yeah, my expectation on Peloton is that it, my expectation truly is that it becomes, you know, it"
"1381440","1387440"," really, I mean, they might be able to save themselves, but I really do see them becoming a lower"
"1387440","1390400"," tier brand, right?"
"1390400","1392280"," You're like, oh, yeah, that's Peloton over there."
"1392360","1393120"," We can afford that now."
"1393220","1393780"," Let's go do it. "
"1393920","1397960"," You know, that kind of stuff, but they had a real opportunity to see if they had, if they had"
"1397960","1405220"," teamed up with some kind of like cross like a gravel bike company or a brand that wanted to launch,"
"1405220","1408360"," like like gravel bikes or something like that."
"1408700","1412420"," I thought that that was a hugely, hugely best opportunity with their brand was considered."
"1412980","1415060"," Now, speaking of those spot Bitcoin. "
"1415120","1416360"," Yeah, exactly that."
"1416500","1417840"," Shake, wait, check on that."
"1418300","1422380"," These are right now the three biggest ETFs. "
"1422380","1422580"," The track."
"1422820","1424640"," Warren John, I'm going to get to see you brother."
"1425280","1430000"," Stacey after Warren, Binky Brad, I was asked that Bitcoin trust for everybody's out there. "
"1430180","1432480"," Point eight billion and the Fidelity wise origin."
"1432600","1439940"," Bitcoin said they're admits here are fiber complexes and co-work, space is now just how these ETFs"
"1439940","1442420"," trade compared to the underlying Bitcoin that they hold."
"1442940","1445960"," According to data from Y charts, who's looking at the premium. "
"1445960","1447080"," Good morning."
"1447080","1447960"," Good to see you too."
"1448100","1449720"," To their underlying Bitcoin holdings. "
"1450000","1453000"," Right now, the grayscale Bitcoin trust is just about flat."
"1453640","1455500"," No premier discount in the trade."
"1455940","1461080"," The iShares Bitcoin trust is trading at about one half percent discount to what the underlying"
"1461080","1461940"," assets are worth. "
"1461940","1464400"," Same with the Fidelity bit wise trust here."
"1464400","1469820"," So, if you take a look at the premium discount to NAV, these ETFs, they are programming up."
"1470000","1474840"," There's probably a really nice two day like fly you can put on here. "
"1475160","1481060"," Right where we are, just a sweet, sexy, wide fly with the Friday expiry."
"1481480","1483800"," This looks like a great place for something like that."
"1483920","1484460"," Deep dive. "
"1484900","1489740"," Still to come, lawmakers slamming Mark Zuckerberg and other social media CEOs over the potential"
"1489740","1494360"," harm their platforms have on kids leading to a surprise apology from Zuckerberg."
"1494980","1496660"," Our next guest was an early investor in Facebook."
"1497200","1499040"," He has a warning for the social media chiefs. "
"1499520","1500920"," Stay with us back in a moment."
"1502240","1506780"," Yeah, Cririlo, I think the IP is still valuable, but I think it has to be taken out of their"
"1506780","1507080"," hands."
"1507800","1510780"," I think the brand is suffering all along the way. "
"1511000","1515040"," I think that the brand needs to be picked up by someone that you can trust."
"1532440","1538120"," Yeah, Bork, I was thinking here, I'm like, if you thought about it, let's say if you were to think"
"1538120","1545760"," about a fly here, you could, you could rain in the downside, legs of the, of the bottom of the"
"1545760","1549960"," fly, you're likely not going to trade 468, right?"
"1550160","1553480"," Like 478, maybe 475 on the downside."
"1554180","1560000"," And then upside, you could do a whole bunch of upside for any kind of an upside or any kind"
"1560000","1561800"," of squeeze into Friday's clothes. "
"1562480","1593640"," Seems like a no brainer here, like it's the"
"1593640","1594080"," Peloton."
"1595220","1598140"," I saw some breaking news on Peloton."
"1598220","1601220"," I don't know that it was exactly correlated with their ER release. "
"1602020","1604520"," I have to dig it out and find out what they said."
"1632790","1638250"," If you have a chance, take a look at my profile this morning and the posts that I made on"
"1638250","1641670"," Twitter, if you feel like you don't know where we are in the market right now."
"1654260","1655180"," One minute remaining. "
"1657100","1663800"," There was some there was there was an alert on CNBC here, but it wasn't about earnings or anything."
"1664040","1665100"," I don't know exactly what it was."
"1665180","1666140"," I can't find it now. "
"1666240","1670400"," It's gone, but they had they had a few a few words about it."
"1690160","1690720"," Five."
"1694970","1695790"," Welcome back. "
"1695930","1698110"," I'm Sylvana Hanau with your CNBC news update."
"1698110","1704010"," A London judge threw out a lawsuit by former president Donald Trump today that accused a former"
"1704010","1706110"," British spy of harming his reputation."
"1706690","1710530"," The judge said there was no compelling reason to allow the case to go to trial. "
"1710950","1716050"," Trump filed the case against Christopher Steele's intelligence company claiming Steele created a"
"1716050","1722590"," dossier in 2016 that contained rumors and uncorroborated obligations that caused a political"
"1722590","1725170"," firestorm right before Trump's inauguration."
"1726310","1732130"," Farming protests in Paris build over into Belgium today outside of the European Union's"

"1738230","1741050"," action on rising prices and increasing regulations. "
"1741090","1747690"," They say are harming their industry and major league baseball and all 30 of its clubs are coming"

"1757290","1761490"," A city worker later found pieces of it on fire at local park. "
"1761830","1764170"," Police are still searching for the culprits."
"1764290","1765110"," Guys, back to you."
"1767290","1773950"," Well, Mark Zuckerberg and other CEOs of social media companies were grilled on Capitol Hill"
"1773950","1776910"," yesterday about the impact that their platforms have on children. "
"1777210","1782730"," Senate lawmakers accusing them of having blood on their hands, which led to an unexpected apology"
"1782730","1783930"," from Mark Zuckerberg."
"1786270","1787330"," Let me ask you this."
"1787490","1789070"," There's families of victims here today. "
"1789070","1790370"," Have you apologized to the victims?"
"1792590","1793990"," Would you like to do so now?"
"1794290","1795030"," Well, they're here."
"1795290","1796250"," You're on national television."
"1796810","1800390"," Would you like now to apologize to the victims who have been harmed by your products?"
"1800610","1801190"," Show them the pictures. "
"1802250","1805410"," Would you like to apologize for what you've done to these good people?"
"1805410","1813430"," Well, you can't identify"
"1813430","1816650"," my real life."
"1816650","1821370"," And this is why we invest in so much, that our own youth who would agree to have the efforts"
"1821370","1826550"," to make sure that for full responsibility for those who have the courage to make sure that your"
"1826550","1827950"," families will catch us on our planet."
"1827950","1832890"," According to the theme of these partners, the founder Roger Malzmann joins us now in discussing"
"1832890","1837050"," hearing and her thoughts about overall policy going forward. "
"1837210","1841870"," First, just give me a reaction to Zuckerberg's decision to turn around and address those parents in"
"1841870","1842190"," that way."
"1843670","1845530"," First of all, I admire him for doing that."
"1845730","1851450"," I think that it's really important to acknowledge responsibility in this case so I tip my hat to"
"1851450","1852010"," mark for doing it. "
"1852130","1853490"," I don't think the apology itself."
"1853490","1857730"," Helps at all, but I think it was an excellent gesture."
"1858050","1863230"," I think from an investor point of view, when you look at that hearing, I think the two things that"
"1863230","1870190"," really stand out are one that the tone of the hearing and the presence of the families and the"
"1870190","1875090"," large numbers of young people in the room gave this. "
"1875090","1879530"," This particular hearing more gravitas than the ones we've had in the past."
"1880090","1882830"," And so I think there is some kind of markets going to leave."
"1883310","1887570"," That said, and this is the second point, I think the key one for investors, there is no reason to"
"1887570","1890250"," believe Congress is going to act on this this year. "
"1890590","1894570"," In fact, it's not clear when, if ever, Congress is ever going to act."
"1895330","1901570"," Facebook are really meta and the other majors each have allies inside Congress."
"1902670","1910190"," Leader Schumer has been an absolutely reliable defender of meta interests in Congress and has the"
"1910190","1911990"," ability to block things from coming to the floor. "
"1912590","1916430"," And so when you look at it, I don't think investors need to worry about that."
"1916610","1921450"," I think what they need to worry about are the lawsuits that are going on, particularly the ones of"
"1921450","1922730"," the state attorneys general."
"1923230","1929590"," Because I think the cases going after design are a real threat and it's almost certain that they're"
"1929590","1930350"," going to lose them. "
"1930590","1933330"," And I think the other guys have other legal cases that they're going to lose."
"1933490","1937150"," Roger, why is it certain that they're almost certain that they're going to lose them?"
"1937350","1938510"," Thus far, they have yet to."
"1938710","1940070"," I mean, they hide, not hide. "
"1940310","1943510"," They use 230, they use 1A, they use as a legal justification."
"1944570","1945330"," Why is that going to change?"
"1946630","1948470"," So David, excellent question."
"1948610","1955550"," So we've had the first example of a 230 case being won by the plaintiff, which happened just like a"
"1955550","1956310"," month or so ago. "
"1957030","1963170"," The extraordinary Kerry Goldberg, who has been a defender of women who've had their privacy invaded"
"1963170","1966850"," or had their lives turned over, has won a case."
"1967250","1968490"," And I think it's the first."
"1968490","1970090"," And here's why I think it's different. "
"1970510","1977650"," 230 was created to protect internet platforms as effectively common carriers, saying they were like"
"1977650","1980390"," a telephone company and they had no control of the security attack."
"1980590","1983970"," The cases that are coming up now are about design."
"1985050","1989450"," And design is something over which internet platforms have 100% control. "
"1989450","1997410"," And the cases against Instagram, against Meta's Instagram division, which there are a total of 10"
"1997410","2001950"," cases, one of them is a group of 33 states in federal court, the other."
"2002330","2004730"," But we'll take individual states in their own countries."
"2005510","2012970"," They all allege that Meta allowed the design of Instagram. "
"2012970","2019850"," The effect of the Instagram design was there to addict children and to leave them vulnerable to all"
"2019850","2021670"," kinds of predation."
"2022450","2028670"," And the problem here is that every time a court rules with Meta, what they're saying is the first"
"2028670","2035730"," amendment in section 230 entitled Internet Company to knowingly harm their users for profit."
"2036470","2039310"," And you know, politically, I just don't think that's going to hold up. "
"2039630","2042290"," And eventually, some judges going to go, wait a minute."
"2042830","2045770"," These are conscious choices made with full information."
"2046370","2052030"," And we have in the public record, very clear evidence that the executives of Meta knew what they"
"2052030","2053830"," were doing in the design of Instagram. "
"2054750","2057190"," And as a result, I don't think there's going to be any place to hide."
"2057670","2061449"," They may ruin a few more cases, but they're eventually going to lose one."
"2061449","2065409"," Just the way that the tobacco guys and the gun guys eventually lost cases. "
"2065710","2068909"," I think the stock market, when that happens, will be similar."
"2069489","2073110"," And if I were investor today, I'd be at least planning for that."
"2074010","2075909"," Doesn't look like that's happening with Meta shares. "
"2076230","2078969"," You're an all time high leading into earnings today, Roger."
"2080250","2081469"," That's absolutely correct."
"2081650","2085409"," And my point here is you don't want to wait until after they crash before you share this insight. "
"2086929","2090610"," But I think it doesn't, doesn't Congress get the blame here, honestly."
"2090929","2095030"," I mean, Senator Amy Klobuchar, when she, when she compared this to Boeing and she said nobody"
"2095030","2097710"," questioned the decision to ground 700 planes."
"2097890","2101590"," So why aren't we taking the same type of decisive action on the danger of these platforms when we"
"2101590","2102630"," know these kids are dying?"
"2103490","2107890"," It's how many child safety laws has Congress passed in the last few years?"
"2109230","2116990"," You guys know this because you first let me raise these issues in August of 2017, and literally"
"2116990","2118270"," nothing has happened. "
"2118710","2125370"," So Congress clearly has blood on its hands also, as does both the Trump administration and the"
"2125370","2126050"," Biden administration."
"2126810","2133550"," But the reality is that these companies are doing this, knowing that the designs they make are"
"2133550","2134570"," leading to harm."
"2134570","2135830"," That the harm is inevitable. "
"2136290","2137590"," And those are choices they're making."
"2137810","2140370"," So ultimately, they're the ones who are most responsible for this."
"2140770","2146030"," But you're absolutely correct that Congress has totally failed in its responsibility to protect its"
"2146030","2146410"," constituents. "
"2147050","2147530"," Yeah."
"2148050","2151210"," Do we end up with some sort of a large fund then of some kind?"
"2151470","2151890"," I'll have tobacco."
"2152390","2157590"," I mean, I don't know what, what ultimately, if you are correct, Roger, what is the impact?"
"2157990","2159150"," What does it look like a settlement?"
"2160150","2167890"," Well, to my perspective, the right strategy here, because this is a problem that is continuous"
"2167890","2172430"," because every year they're new teenagers, you have to change the problem. "
"2172750","2174470"," You have to change the design at this work."
"2174630","2181090"," You either have to decide that there's going to be a much higher age limit for using social media"
"2181090","2187650"," and or you're going to prevent the capture and exploitation of data about minors."
"2188450","2194110"," And you're going to have to sit there and have penalties that are maybe felony penalties as opposed"
"2194110","2199930"," to civil penalties in order to change the incentives to get people to focus on product safety. "
"2200490","2205450"," And that's a lot to imagine Congress doing at any point in time, much less in an election."
"2206010","2206210"," Yeah."
"2206570","2211810"," Roger, we don't have time to debate it, but I know you're going to have an opinion on Musk's pay"
"2211810","2217610"," package, on the judges' decision in Delaware, on his potential move now to reincorporate the tax. "
"2217610","2218810"," Where do you come down on it?"
"2220270","2225730"," If I am an investor looking at this thing, the one thing I would observe is that Tesla, at least,"
"2225890","2228190"," is really a phenomena of Elon Musk."
"2228590","2230370"," And I think there's an interesting question to ask."
"2230910","2237970"," Whether changing the pay package doesn't actually motivate him, one would hope that this would get"
"2237970","2242350"," his competitive juices going and that he would try to really buckle down and do something. "
"2242350","2244970"," Because the problem is he's been all over the place, right?"
"2245370","2252290"," I mean, he exhibits a lot of symptoms of conditions that would normally require medical"
"2252290","2252830"," intervention."
"2253410","2259130"," And, you know, I don't know the man, but he's created some amazing things and he's in the process"
"2259130","2259950"," of wrecking them."
"2259950","2266250"," And so, I'm hoping the judges thing will act as a warning and just say, hey, dude, this is your"
"2266250","2271250"," opportunity to, you know, prove that this was no food. "
"2272250","2275010"," All right, to be continued, Roger, always appreciated."
"2275370","2275890"," Thanks for your time."
"2276250","2277410"," I'm right in the pool. "
"2278090","2282370"," Stella Head, more on the market says Fed Chair Powell, of course, cold water in hopes of a March"
"2282370","2283050"," rate cut."
"2283470","2284210"," So what comes next?"
"2284590","2286770"," Apollo's chief economist joins us with his predictions."
"2287590","2294270"," With stocks pushing higher here, the Dow up 113, S&P also rising a little more than half a percent. "
"2294410","2294830"," We'll be right back."
"2479400","2480660"," Welcome to Squawk on the street."
"2480960","2481840"," Welcome back, I should say. "
"2481840","2485640"," The stocks rebounding nicely a day after Powell said a March rate cut looks unlikely."
"2486080","2490780"," Our next guest says that uncertainty about the ongoing soft landing will keep volatility elevated."
"2491000","2494680"," Apollo Global Management, chief economist, Torsen Slock joins us now. "
"2495040","2499440"," Powell was pretty careful not to declare victory on the whole soft landing idea."
"2499820","2501580"," Torsen, are you still not convinced?"
"2502480","2508260"," Well, I think he was quite balanced, saying on the one hand that things aren't moving in the right"
"2508260","2508760"," direction."
"2508760","2511880"," He expects inflation to continue to move in the right direction. "
"2512560","2516980"," But at the same time, he did just simply say that it's just a little bit too early to come"
"2516980","2520400"," to the conclusion that we can already begin to cut rates in March."
"2520720","2525300"," So from that perspective, he was really telling us rates are going to stay higher for a little"
"2525300","2529920"," while longer, at least in terms of what markets have been expecting before the FOMC meeting."
"2530400","2534900"," I guess one of the questions then out of that, is it going to be the three cuts that the"
"2534900","2537380"," Fed forecast will happen this year?"
"2537380","2539800"," Or is it going to be the five that the market is forecasting?"
"2540740","2545140"," Well, that's a very important debate, Sarah, because if you think about it, what would the economy"
"2545140","2547660"," look like if the Fed were going to cut six times?"
"2548100","2552320"," I mean, would that be an economy that's really weak with very weak non-farm payrolls, weak consumer"
"2552320","2553180"," spending, weak GDP?"
"2553820","2559460"," Or can they just normalize interest rates and cut rates six times without the risk that this might"
"2559460","2563900"," create a big rally in equities and in credit and in risky assets more broadly?"
"2563900","2568700"," So therefore, I think that they are right, that they will cut rates three times this year. "
"2568980","2573460"," I think the market has been getting ahead of itself with pricing in many more rate cuts because it"
"2573460","2578860"," will be associated with a much weaker economy if they were to cut as many times as the market"
"2578860","2579540"," currently is pricing."
"2579540","2582560"," Well, but that's not necessarily what the market's saying."
"2582640","2586680"," The market's saying that inflation has been fought and won. "
"2587460","2592020"," And do you not buy the idea that if that's the case, then they have some room to be less"
"2592020","2593800"," restrictive to preserve the soft landing?"
"2594560","2598640"," Through and if you take their framework, which they have used for decades named the Taylor Rule,"
"2598760","2602720"," which simply would say that inflation comes down, normal rates can also begin to come down and"
"2602720","2605400"," therefore real rates can stay more steady."
"2605400","2609980"," Well, then that would certainly suggest that they should begin to cut rates and potentially cut"
"2609980","2611680"," rates a bit more than even what they are saying."
"2612020","2617680"," The problem with this is that that does not take into account the reality that when they do begin"
"2617680","2624840"," to cut, it does begin to raise the risk of a very significant boom in capital markets activity in"
"2624840","2629320"," IPO activity in M&A activity in issuance in IG and high yield and loans. "
"2629320","2634840"," So if the Fed says green light, you can basically go ahead and take the risk that you want."
"2635220","2640500"," That will come with a circular effect of creating a boom in housing in wages and therefore"
"2640500","2642080"," ultimately maybe even in the legal market."
"2642540","2643980"," So yes, I understand what you're saying. "
"2643980","2647880"," And I agree that when inflation comes down, normal rates should also be coming down."
"2648180","2653640"," But the reason why I think they will proceed cautiously is because of the effects of their actions"
"2653640","2656200"," on risk taking in financial markets."
"2656840","2660860"," Torsten, great as chart from you this morning, looking at the percentage of household debt that's"
"2660860","2662800"," fixed, almost 90%. "
"2662800","2666820"," You argue that's one reason why the transmission mechanism has been so weak."
"2667000","2670420"," So are we really at a stage where we're just waiting for the job market to crack?"
"2670920","2671520"," And is that happening?"
"2672680","2677280"," I mean, it depends on how much weight you want to put on the jobless claims numbers that just came"
"2677280","2681240"," up this morning and ADP yesterday was also not particularly good."
"2681240","2684440"," So let's see what we get with non-fan payrolls tomorrow. "
"2685140","2689900"," But if the job market starts cracking and if we do begin to see a most significant slowdown in the"
"2689900","2695040"," labor market, then it will set off a number of chain reactions, not only with housing beginnings to"
"2695040","2698800"," slow down, but certainly also we already seeing a consumer being vulnerable."
"2699420","2702280"," Highly-level consumers are seeing the language rates at high levels."
"2702560","2706540"," You're also seeing highly-leveled companies are seeing default rates at high levels, so the"
"2706540","2706860"," vulnerability. "
"2706860","2712020"," And of course, the main issue is in commercial release date, if people start losing their jobs and"
"2712020","2717360"," therefore office space also takes another hit, then we could begin to see more of these things that"
"2717360","2721560"," we have talked so much about over the last year and with the banking sector also potentially being"
"2721560","2721840"," in trouble."
"2722140","2728320"," So it is a more fragile slowdown that we're seeing here as a result of this, yes, so far, so"
"2728320","2728520"," good."
"2728840","2733080"," But if the labor market does crack, then that would indeed bring along a number of other problems. "
"2733580","2738680"," But you think that would have to be pretty violent to resuscitate the March argument, yes?"
"2740580","2741740"," So that's so here."
"2741880","2745720"," The debate, of course, is that, well, if the labor market does begin to weaken momentarily"
"2745720","2750500"," tomorrow, then I do think that they will have to put a cut in March back on the table."
"2750860","2755260"," But the bigger discussion really here is the very important one that every market at the moment is"
"2755260","2758660"," pricing as soft landing, and it really is almost goldilocks everywhere. "
"2758660","2763060"," And what I'm basically pointing out is that there are also other scenarios that don't have a zero"
"2763060","2763540"," of probability."
"2763900","2767960"," There's certainly a scenario that if we do get a legal labor market over the next several months,"
"2767980","2772260"," that would then bring along a number of other things that can increase the risk again of a harder"
"2772260","2772520"," landing."
"2772820","2776900"," So we are not out of the woods in terms of declaring victory, neither on inflation getting back to"
"2776900","2781340"," 2%, but also not on basically declaring victory that this will be a soft landing. "
"2781340","2786640"," There's still a lot of things that can happen, but also to the upside, if they begin to cut too"
"2786640","2788420"," quickly and the economy begins to rebound."
"2788740","2793400"," So the bottom line is, soft landing is almost priced with 100% probability, but the two other"
"2793400","2798520"," scenarios named the re-acceleration and hard landing, they certainly do not, in my view, have a"
"2798520","2799420"," zero percent likelihood."
"2800100","2804200"," Well, while we're talking about potential risks, I mean, I think it's worth pulling up the regional"
"2804200","2810840"," banks and the New York Community Bank Corp, which is not necessarily a systemic issue right now,"
"2810840","2817000"," but it does revive sentiment concerns around regional banks and gives us a little deja vu back to"
"2817000","2817220"," March. "
"2817360","2822420"," Do you worry about a share price that has basically been in free fall here and these problems?"
"2823020","2828160"," Yeah, so the banking sector holds about three trillion dollars in commercial release day loans."
"2828900","2833180"," And to your point, Sarah, if you look at what has happened to the price per square foot for office,"
"2833180","2834860"," that's down about 40% from the peak."
"2834860","2840560"," So you can quickly begin to figure out those who hold office at a more broadly commercial release"
"2840560","2842140"," date that has declined in value. "
"2842600","2847840"," They, of course, are likely facing some challenges in particular, if the economy does begin to slow"
"2847840","2848060"," down."
"2848300","2852320"," Note that we have had these banking problems in a solid, relatively strong economy."
"2852820","2857260"," I mean, page one in your IMF textbook will tell you that if you start to see a slowdown and"
"2857260","2861500"," if you start to see a recession, it normally comes with more problems in the banking sector. "
"2861500","2866500"," So the fact that we have had problems in the banking sector, even before the economy has started to"
"2866500","2868480"," slow down, that does answer your question."
"2869100","2873620"," And that does tell us that yes, they are still fairly bumpy roads ahead in particular when it comes"
"2873620","2874480"," to commercial release date."
"2874960","2877080"," I mean, do you think it's a little strange that they took out?"
"2877220","2877740"," I don't know why. "
"2877920","2881160"," They took out the U.S. banking system as sound and resilient from the Fed statement?"
"2881640","2885500"," I would assume they just did it because people stopped worrying about regional banks."
"2885940","2887340"," But that was new when yesterday's statement."
"2887860","2893740"," So there were a number of changes in the statement that indeed would live some eyebrows in terms"
"2893740","2895480"," of, okay, what exactly are they telling us here?"
"2896100","2901060"," And the fact that we now for some time, at least for the last several months, have been saying,"
"2901060","2903440"," okay, now maybe the economy is not going to slow down. "
"2904020","2907740"," Maybe and to round out this discussion, maybe it really is a debate that, well, we all went into"
"2907740","2910440"," 2023 saying, oh, recession is coming, recession is coming."
"2910440","2914060"," Now we all went into 2024 until there's no recession, it's a soft landing."
"2914580","2918900"," Maybe we could have the exact opposite scenario of last year where we again, well, everyone assumed"
"2918900","2922500"," there was a soft landing, and maybe the slow down is finally coming in 2024. "
"2923140","2926840"," So it would be a little bit ironic that the pendulum swung too much in the other direction."
"2927300","2929440"," Yeah, content is rarely right, I guess."
"2930020","2930700"," Thank you, Torsten. "
"2931120","2931540"," Appreciate it."
"2931640","2931720"," Thank you."
"2931720","2932540"," Torsten, slot. "

"3130140","3132020"," Let's get to Robert Frank with the breakdown."
"3132260","3132740"," Morning, Robert."
"3133060","3136540"," Sarah Ferrari reporting a beat on sales and meeting those earnings targets. "
"3136540","3142400"," It was the 2024 outlook, though, that analysts really liked Ferrari reaffirming that 2024 guidance"
"3142400","3145140"," for 7% earnings growth to $2.6 billion."
"3145920","3151300"," CEO Benedetto Vinya saying there is no sign that the wealthy are slowing down on buying Ferraris."
"3151300","3155460"," He said, quote, demand is very strong in 2025 and 26. "
"3156260","3160580"," Quote, there is not an impact of any kind on our clients that he could see."
"3160940","3167020"," Interestingly, hybrid cars now account for 42% 44% of all Ferraris sold."
"3167240","3169100"," That has doubled over the past year. "
"3169240","3171700"," They will launch their first ever EV in 2025."
"3172560","3175700"," Now, a lot of their profit growth right now is coming from personalization."
"3176360","3180080"," That's buyers customizing their cars and selling a lot more expensive models. "
"3180380","3183860"," There was no mention, by the way, of Lewis Hamilton joining the form of the one team report say"
"3183860","3185500"," that he could join in 2025."
"3185640","3189840"," But if you look at commercial activities, that includes sales of clothing, merchandise, brand,"
"3190020","3190700"," partnerships, and racing."
"3190980","3193300"," They're about 10% of sales right now. "
"3193700","3197680"," Then you're saying F1 could actually be lower this year to the higher cost and spending."
"3197680","3199560"," Now, Ferraris went at Le Mans."
"3199860","3201840"," That's the first time they competed there in 50 years. "
"3202000","3202560"," That was celebrated."
"3202880","3204620"," Very important for the company's racing DNA."
"3205480","3211760"," So, Sarah, if you look at their market cap, Ferrari now, it is 50% higher than Ford or GM"
"3211760","3214280"," at over 72 billion dollars. "
"3214800","3217880"," It is truly unbelievable for an auto company."
"3218200","3222460"," I would say that Lewis Hamilton News Robert is having a big impact today."
"3222960","3225980"," Lewis is the biggest star in Formula One. "
"3225980","3228180"," He's an international superstar, seven-time champ."
"3228540","3230540"," He's expanded the tent as far as the audience."
"3231160","3235300"," And remember, there was all this drama with Total Wolf, the head of the Mercedes team, last year,"
"3235560","3236880"," about Lewis resigning. "
"3237120","3238880"," And we interviewed him on this show about it."
"3239160","3239800"," Just take a listen."
"3242640","3243860"," Well, we're still talking. "
"3244120","3248940"," You know, we get this question basically every race weekend and with such a good relationship that"
"3248940","3249920"," we dread the moment."
"3250000","3251140"," We need to talk about money."
"3251740","3253400"," So, it's going to happen soon. "
"3254020","3255300"," We need to make some news here."
"3255680","3257520"," Soon, you have a time frame of when that's going to happen."
"3257520","3259520"," Soon, I think we're talking more days than weeks. "
"3259880","3260600"," More days than weeks."
"3260640","3265700"," Yeah, but if I commit to a date now, then everybody's going to ask in Montreal on the weekend to"
"3265700","3266860"," what's happened to the days."
"3267380","3268640"," You should get it done before then. "
"3268820","3269360"," It sounds like."
"3269920","3271380"," Yeah, we're trying hard."
"3271520","3272560"," But at least I get to see him today. "
"3272720","3273600"," Maybe we can talk about it."
"3274420","3275540"," So, that was last June."
"3275840","3276700"," Turns out they did sign. "
"3276980","3279020"," They signed Lewis for this season 24."
"3279020","3281220"," And then I guess an option for 25."
"3281800","3286700"," And it sounds like he took the option to go with Ferrari, which is only going to make for a"
"3286700","3289860"," bit of an awkward start to the season this year where he'll be racing for Mercedes. "
"3290640","3291820"," It's a huge deal, Robert."
"3292000","3298320"," And if there's one thing I learned in making the documentary about F1, the brand Halo that these"
"3298320","3302880"," Formula One teams get when it comes to selling, you know, the big picture, what you're reporting"
"3302880","3303580"," on, the earnings."
"3304400","3304680"," It's there. "
"3305200","3306200"," I mean, it's win on Sunday."
"3306600","3307420"," Sell on Monday."
"3307420","3309080"," And there's, and there's a serious correlation. "
"3309600","3312200"," And I think just Lewis's star power to Ferrari is a big deal."
"3312340","3316620"," The one thing I'd say is, Ferrari hasn't won a constructors titles in 15 years, but the sales of"
"3316620","3317800"," cars have more than doubled."
"3317800","3322840"," So this would be icing on the cake if they can get him and expose that brand even further. "
"3323400","3323660"," Yeah."
"3324160","3324460"," Good point."
"3325000","3327020"," Well, people are certainly excited about it. "
"3327200","3330140"," Stocks up another nine, nine and a half percent on all that good news."
"3330360","3331420"," Robert, thank you."
"3331420","3332200"," Yeah. "
"3332340","3334180"," Oh, it's a marble at the market campus."
"3334520","3335400"," Robert, I'm going to point it out."
"3335760","3338320"," Approaching a hundred building for a roaring. "
"3338560","3338740"," All right."
"3338900","3341480"," Don't miss the CEOs of Shell and Royal Caribbean."
"3341480","3342720"," They're going to be in the next hour. "
"3343440","3346260"," Of course, our live market coverage also continues right after this."
"3349820","3356450"," About 70% the lowest since June."
"3511640","3514000"," New York community shares down. "
"3529370","3530470"," Good Thursday morning."
"3530710","3531550"," Welcome to Money Movers."
"3531850","3532110"," I'm Sarah. "
"3532330","3536250"," I've been with Carlton Janilla live from post nine of the New York Stock Exchange huge hour ahead"
"3536250","3536850"," for us today."
"3537310","3542390"," The CEOs of Shell, Novartis and Royal Caribbean all joining us on earnings this morning."
"3542530","3547850"," Plus, we will talk to the CEO of Amer Sports going public here today. "
"3547850","3551290"," And debut investors are hoping will turn around a muted idea market."
"3551850","3553170"," Let's begin with the market."
"3553470","3554850"," Stocks have lost some ground here. "
"3554950","3555670"," Dow's gone red."
"3555870","3556490"," Is the street digest?"
"3556810","3558070"," What we learned from the Fed yesterday?"
"3558530","3560750"," How, of course, taking a March cut off the table."
"3561030","3564330"," BNY melons head of U.S. Macrosonia, Michigan's here with us at post nine. "
"3564450","3564930"," It's going to be back."
"3565070","3566510"," Sony, thank you for coming in."
"3566630","3571970"," Today's a day where people are watching the bank weakness some soft labor data and wondering if"
"3571970","3573410"," that was a mistake. "
"3573650","3576190"," If they're doing a transitory all over again."
"3576570","3576890"," What's your view?"
"3576890","3582110"," Well, you know what, I think to some extent the Fed doesn't in fact know when they're going to go."
"3582830","3586750"," And they are not necessarily a reverse to keeping the market in the dark as well. "
"3587210","3592150"," Because it is unclear how the data will evolve on the inflation side and on the labor market side."
"3592550","3596750"," It does look like the labor market is somewhat back to the conditions where we were in 2019."
"3597430","3599110"," But it is still quite tight. "
"3599870","3602550"," And on the services side, inflation is still strong."
"3603070","3606310"," So to us it's actually quite understandable that they took March off the time."
"3606310","3612150"," I know you're not a bank analyst, but were your eyebrows raised when they took soundness off the"
"3612150","3613110"," statement?"
"3613410","3617630"," They did an excellent job rolling out a very effective facility very quickly. "
"3618510","3623010"," That said, you know, smaller regional banks are obviously still suffering."
"3623230","3624750"," I don't think they're not acknowledging that."
"3624850","3628110"," I think they're just saying the industry overall is fairly sound. "
"3628650","3633950"," And credit provision and reserves haven't been as adversely affected as was feared in March 2023."
"3634510","3638650"," Does the number of cuts and when they happen affect your market outlook for this year?"
"3639330","3639930"," Yes, of course."
"3640410","3642830"," But really growth is also very important, right?"
"3642970","3648110"," If the growth of the employment and growth components hold up, then if they do fewer cuts against"
"3648110","3650850"," that background, risk assets might still hold up well. "
"3651390","3652270"," Is that your view?"
"3652650","3653270"," That's going to happen?"
"3653350","3656150"," It's our central expectation, but of course there are risks around that."
"3656430","3657470"," And how many cuts should we expect?"
"3658350","3663930"," We do think the market got maybe a little bit."
"3663930","3666130"," But let's talk about something this morning. "
"3666350","3671610"," So we said, you don't expect too much upside, right?"
"3672150","3676350"," On the day here, we are on the first of the month."
"3677170","3683130"," So we should expect on first of the month some sort of consolidationary phase over one to two"
"3683130","3683370"," weeks."
"3683370","3687610"," But this is more important or more importantly, what I want to say to you is any of you that"
"3687610","3694610"," have been this stream for a long time, know that as we approach resistance levels on triggers,"
"3694610","3696070"," that's right here, right?"
"3697430","3702850"," You take the money and run as we approach major triggers. "
"3703290","3704630"," That could be an hourly trigger."
"3705070","3706510"," You guys out there watching right now?"
"3707330","3708910"," It could be an hourly trigger."
"3710150","3711450"," It can be a daily trigger. "
"3713130","3713650"," Right?"
"3714210","3716710"," It could be an hourly trigger, daily trigger, weekly trigger."
"3716890","3719570"," It doesn't really matter."
"3719570","3720430"," Weekly trigger. "
"3721830","3723310"," So on and so forth."
"3724030","3732590"," Now, the reason we take the money before we get, before we, the possible outcomes here are that we"
"3732590","3736670"," sell early, which this is what that is, or we break above."
"3737590","3739990"," We normally come back down though, right?"
"3741810","3746350"," Unconsolidate or consolidate and even roll down to the downside, okay?"
"3748470","3753330"," There is the potential for us to break above, consolidate, and then move higher. "
"3754270","3761750"," The reason for these triggers is for you to know where those take profit places are, right?"
"3762510","3769050"," So you try to take the trade early, then you take your profit here before you reach, and then you"
"3769050","3770470"," reenter the trade again."
"3771250","3779270"," If you're still bullish, once we break above, consolidate and get above the previous high on a"
"3779270","3780530"," break above, right?"
"3781250","3783690"," So let's take a look at this really quick, even closer here."
"3786820","3788340"," So you should have taken the money. "
"3788440","3794640"," Well, at least you guys know that I, if I, if I'm trading my own rules, you know that I"
"3794640","3797560"," exit the trade before we ever get to a trigger."
"3798560","3803360"," Some of you out there, I know, will take some of it and leave some runners on for that last"
"3803360","3805540"," little bit so you don't get torched."
"3806260","3807600"," Just in case we do break above. "
"3808160","3809480"," Turn that down a little bit here."
"3814660","3820220"," But generally speaking, your zone to zone trading on these triggers, right?"
"3820520","3822980"," So let's say you're buying the dip down here."
"3823640","3827700"," As we come up here, you take your trade off, right?"
"3829340","3831760"," Now we're not talking, we're not talking. "
"3833980","3835740"," Condors or flies or any of that kind of stuff."
"3835860","3837620"," We're talking, you know, taking a trade up here, right?"
"3838000","3840380"," The price target right now of the early trigger, right?"
"3840920","3842360"," So you take your trade off right here."
"3843060","3844820"," And if, let's say we did break above, right?"
"3845600","3849240"," You, sometimes I'll see, I'll see some of you guys be like, oh, I should have left a time for"
"3849240","3850140"," that last little bit. "
"3850480","3853020"," And truthfully, this is the trade right here."
"3853240","3855820"," This is the high probability winner, right?"
"3855820","3859140"," Now, let's say you're like, ah, I should have stayed for the last one right there."
"3859140","3865620"," You're still waiting for that consolidation and that new hide to break above the previous side. "
"3865640","3867020"," You'll get the pullback right here."
"3867320","3870460"," You'll get the one in five minute trigger following to the upside."
"3871540","3872860"," You get that one minute coming up. "
"3873000","3875300"," You get that, whoop, you get the one minute coming up right there."
"3875400","3879200"," You get the five minute coming up as well, right?"
"3879880","3880280"," Coming up here."
"3880420","3882740"," And then you know to reenter the trade once again. "
"3883180","3883880"," Sorry about that."
"3884540","3885660"," Right in there."
"3885840","3886520"," Does that make sense?"
"3886760","3890160"," You'll, you'll, like all this action in here, you don't get involved in. "
"3890260","3891760"," You'll get torn up in here."
"3891760","3895280"," You read, you jump back into the trade once it's confirmed that we're going higher."
"3895580","3898620"," Now, we just rolled on this trade, right?"
"3899500","3904740"," So if you're the smart trader, not pulling a cap in Jim James and you came in here. "
"3905680","3907880"," He took your money and we, I didn't get caught."
"3907880","3908820"," You're like, oh hell yeah."
"3908920","3909260"," Copy. "
"3909380","3910200"," I didn't get caught, right?"
"3910780","3911340"," What's the other?"
"3911340","3913000"," Let's say you did get caught."
"3913120","3913880"," Let's say you're like, hey, cap."
"3915000","3919740"," I was long, man, and I saw, all right, we got rejected here. "
"3920380","3921980"," Where is your stop, right?"
"3922260","3924160"," The big next question becomes where is your stop?"
"3924380","3925420"," And it's down here somewhere."
"3926360","3928980"," You have the cross happening on the one and five minute trigger."
"3929980","3934280"," This would, this should stop you out from this run to the upside, right?"
"3934660","3935060"," At minimum. "
"3935340","3941080"," So you're managing either being flat or whatever losses you had or taking whatever profit you made"
"3941080","3942960"," on some kind of a cross right here."
"3943300","3944180"," And what do we have that?"
"3944300","3945340"," What do we have that happened here?"
"3945400","3949420"," We have a failure to get above the hourly trigger, right?"
"3949860","3953320"," We have a one and five minute bear plane right here."
"3953460","3958360"," That's a bear plane is when you get a cross of the one and five minute trigger. "
"3958540","3959120"," That's right here."
"3960180","3960620"," Right?"
"3963140","3964760"," So you get that cross right there."
"3965020","3967020"," And what has to happen now?"
"3967360","3968700"," We know what has to happen, right?"
"3968700","3973900"," We have to come back and back test this bear plane. "
"3974060","3976460"," You don't just like blast down and never come back up again."
"3976880","3977860"," So that's what's going to happen."
"3977860","3979040"," It's going to come back up right now. "
"3979080","3982240"," Price will come back up and test first the one minute."
"3982980","3988140"," And continue to it's downside or it's going to break above the one minute and then test the five"
"3988140","3990820"," minute right here and then continue down to the downside."
"3991340","3996560"," And when this these tests, if they're successful or they fail, you'll go down if they come back up"
"3996560","3997880"," and we reverse to the upside. "
"3997880","3999860"," You'll then get a bull plane up here."
"4000020","4004540"," We'll start heading to the upside and try to get above this hourly trigger."
"4004780","4007760"," So this is all supply demand, strength of buyers and sellers. "
"4008360","4011020"," Another thing that you should be noticing here is what?"
"4011680","4013760"," And that is we have some coiling action here."
"4013860","4014620"," You can see it, right?"
"4015140","4016560"," We have range expansion."
"4017280","4020640"," That's building as the day progresses, right?"
"4021340","4026920"," So on Twitter this morning, I talked to you about how we're opening this morning and I'm not"
"4026920","4033380"," expecting that range expansion on the opening bell, but I'm expecting it as we get towards the end"
"4033380","4038620"," of the day into earnings, where we get a huge move to the upside or a huge move to the"
"4038620","4038880"," downside. "
"4039320","4043180"," Now downside potential, we know there's a support level here somewhere."
"4043840","4047160"," We know that the daily trigger, sorry."
"4047960","4054100"," So this daily trigger is down below here at 47788. "
"4054480","4055300"," So right down here."
"4055300","4058560"," We know there's some kind of a floor down here currently."
"4059180","4062000"," Or we expect there to be some kind of a floor down here. "
"4062380","4066160"," So as this range expansion takes place today, right?"
"4066580","4069520"," When I was saying to you earlier, you open yourself a nice fly."
"4069560","4074960"," You open a fly down below the daily trigger and you know that you can probably have a nice really,"
"4074960","4083300"," really wide upside, previous high from yesterday as the other side of that leg, right?"
"4083300","4084180"," Your legs down here."
"4084480","4088700"," You put your other legs all the way to the top and you don't really care what happens in here"
"4088700","4093480"," and you really don't care what the result is into the end of the day today for Thursday. "
"4093760","4099140"," We also know something else here and that would be that, let's see if I get that right there."
"4099640","4101060"," Let me mute this right here."
"4103540","4108180"," I'll make this a little bit bigger here. "
"4110120","4111620"," That'll look bigger right there."
"4112760","4114260"," Down there, that's better."
"4116200","4118899"," We have the previous highs up here. "
"4118979","4120319"," Look at all that range up here."
"4120460","4123600"," You have all that space for price to go higher, right?"
"4123779","4128200"," We see that also in the triggers that we've got range expansions today."
"4128279","4128899"," You can see it. "
"4129240","4131060"," This is the expected downside move."
"4131479","4133760"," This is the expected upside move right here."
"4134380","4139920"," You can make some, and if you're actually, if you ever want to do some legs, I got some STX"
"4139920","4145060"," buying cells or cells and buys lower and higher to set up these butterflies. "
"4146240","4148420"," You've got this one more down move right here."
"4148580","4149180"," You see that one here?"
"4149319","4150819"," This is S3 down here, right?"
"4152540","4159279"," As we come in this close today, we've got two major reports coming out, right?"
"4159460","4161319"," It looks like doom and gloom as well, doesn't it?"
"4161319","4163660"," When you're on a one minute, that's all squished over."
"4163859","4168479"," But in reality, you just have some range expansions that's starting into the end of the day today. "
"4168960","4171180"," Now, what's the other thing we can extrapolate here?"
"4171540","4176580"," And that is on a weekly basis, are we bullish or bearish?"
"4177060","4180140"," And as we come into Thursday, you tend to get monetization."
"4180760","4183939"," If we're heading down, you get monetization to the downside."
"4184819","4189920"," If we're heading up into the end of the week into Thursday, as you tend to get monetization to the"
"4189920","4191340"," upside on Thursdays, right?"
"4191479","4195800"," Whenever we're running as a bullet, I'm like, oh, we've been manipulating all week long. "
"4196220","4197800"," We're everybody scared that we're going to crash."
"4197900","4201560"," We're going to roll over and we're actually heading up into Thursday."
"4201860","4203860"," You'll see that monetization into Thursday. "
"4204960","4208360"," So my expectation today would be some of this kind of stuff, right?"
"4208920","4214160"," And into the end of the day, looking for some kind of a monetization to the downside."
"4214160","4217840"," So am I bullish into the close today?"
"4218220","4218700"," Not necessarily."
"4219400","4223420"," It would not shock me to see this range expansion continue to the end of the day. "
"4223920","4225320"," Into 4 p.m., right?"
"4225560","4226100"," Somewhere in here."
"4226460","4227640"," All right."
"4228180","4230400"," And then this is the 4 p.m. hour right here. "
"4230720","4233180"," Would not shock me to see the end of the day."
"4235320","4237180"," Doing this kind of stupid shit right here."
"4237380","4239160"," And then in the day, whoop, right down here. "
"4239900","4241220"," And we close at four o'clock."
"4241220","4242460"," Four fifteen down here."
"4242560","4244480"," You're tagging that support down below here. "
"4244820","4250540"," They're setting you up underneath the two gamma levels."
"4250800","4259660"," They'll be setting us up underneath the gamma flip and the CTA cell signal."
"4260020","4261400"," And what would that leave us for Friday?"
"4261880","4264420"," Maybe with some more downside to come in a Friday. "
"4264740","4264820"," Okay."
"4265360","4265880"," Maybe not."
"4266160","4267820"," Or maybe setting it up for next week. "
"4268000","4270180"," Maybe not Friday, but next week coming up."
"4270180","4271000"," Okay."
"4271380","4272380"," So what happens, right?"
"4272460","4273680"," You get a little bit more blood on Friday. "
"4273680","4275480"," Then we bounce up in the end of the day and Friday."
"4275480","4278140"," And then boom, you get the real move down into next week."
"4278700","4281960"," So we might have some corrective behavior into next week coming up. "
"4282000","4283680"," It looks like it's setting up right now."
"4283980","4285680"," Some corrective behavior in the next week."
"4285800","4289100"," We'll look at the seasonality calendar at some point. "
"4289540","4291420"," But watch how this is coiling right here, right?"
"4291700","4292880"," Coiling, coiling, coiling."
"4293360","4299340"," Would not shock me to see us trade back up here and keep bouncing off and kind of fade slowly"
"4299340","4300980"," to the downside with this hourly trigger."
"4301500","4304320"," You can actually see some other insights here as well. "
"4304620","4306320"," Prices underneath the hourly trigger."
"4306740","4309600"," Hourly trigger is still heading lower right now."
"4310060","4313140"," Let's take a look at a 30 minute basis on spoos. "
"4314720","4318060"," Take a look at a 30 minute basis on spoos down here."
"4318600","4325260"," And let's look at the hourly and the half an hour of velocity."
"4325500","4331000"," So when you see this velocity down here on a half hour basis and you're inter-day trading, you're"
"4331000","4333660"," looking for some kind of a bottom for a dip to buy. "
"4334480","4340240"," Now one really bad thing here is that daily velocity is we were experiencing lower highs, lower"
"4340240","4340620"," highs."
"4341020","4345600"," This is predicting some more consolidating and corrective behavior into next week."
"4345860","4352020"," But on a daily basis, the half hour and hourly velocity is predicting some kind of a bottoming"
"4352020","4353800"," action taking place up here. "
"4353800","4358040"," I want to show you that in previous examples here in a half hour basis."
"4358900","4362320"," I want to show you one right here, right down there, right?"
"4362820","4365520"," You see this right here coming down here for a turn."
"4366020","4369040"," We got another little one down here and we got another turn right there. "
"4369300","4375000"," And we're a little bit long and the tooth here and this hourly bearishness down here on this"
"4375000","4376800"," expansion."
"4376800","4381100"," This coiling and expansion down here."
"4381140","4385380"," So I'm going to expect the dip buy still today at some point. "
"4385880","4389120"," So we're going to look at this back now on a one minute basis."
"4389400","4391920"," We should be looking for some kind of a bottom."
"4391960","4393420"," We're going to go to a one minute basis here. "
"4393860","4395440"," And what are we going to be looking for here?"
"4396200","4403140"," For some sign of a dip to buy for the next trip higher is the flattening of the white and"
"4403140","4406220"," the red, the one minute and five minute trigger."
"4406220","4408420"," Five minutes still not chasing yet."
"4408620","4409640"," One minute though is still vertical. "
"4410260","4415160"," I'd really like to see this one minute begin to flatten a little bit to see how it's vertical right"
"4415160","4415440"," now."
"4415740","4421320"," I'd really like to see some flattening action and price trying to recover here and then watch this"
"4421320","4422780"," move to the upside here."
"4423560","4427280"," And we already know that velocity is bottoming on the 30 minute basis. "
"4427960","4429300"," So I'd be expecting another dip buy."
"4429300","4432920"," So they could buy the dip, sell the rip, buy the dip, sell the rip, buy the dip, sell the"
"4432920","4433060"," rip."
"4433400","4435840"," Kind of a situation setting up right now. "
"4438520","4443360"," And we'll take a peak here on, we'll take a peak right over here."
"4443980","4447580"," We're just going to keep our eyes on some of that supply to the downside."
"4449800","4451360"," And see it right down here. "
"4451500","4452720"," There's a stink bid down here."
"4452900","4455200"," There's some demand right over here."
"4455200","4459380"," So it wouldn't shock me to see us bounce really soon and head back to the upside. "
"4461480","4463460"," It's kind of what I like to fly here."
"4463620","4468880"," I like the butterfly into Friday right now because I'm expecting that range expansion, but this"
"4468880","4473560"," bouncing back and forth consolidation in the marketplace here coming up."
"4473680","4475200"," So I'm going to open that one back up for you. "
"4475440","4476880"," Remember that downside target?"
"4477760","4481300"," That expectation is 478 sometime today or into Friday."
"4481840","4490120"," And then upside, we know right now that sellers are stepping in every time we slam into this hourly"
"4490120","4490460"," trigger."
"4490460","4495260"," We've got examples of it here, here, here and right up in here as well. "
"4496100","4500440"," I think yesterday said nice selling off the hourly trigger and they're doing it again."
"4500860","4502700"," So if I was a seller, has this been working?"
"4503180","4504980"," Fuck yeah, it has every time we hit that hourly trigger."
"4505520","4506720"," They're just teeing off on it. "
"4506720","4511520"," So whatever bouncing we have here, I would not be shocked to see us come back up here."
"4511620","4516220"," And then I'm trying to step back in and sell this again or even down here and try to sell"
"4516220","4520340"," this again and staircase us down into the close today."
"4526500","4527340"," Oh yeah. "
"4528040","4531380"," Oh yeah, game changer, game changer with pivots."
"4531840","4534500"," And you want to see, I got some, you want to see some cool shit?"
"4535400","4536200"," Hold on here."
"4537640","4539100"," I got some cool shit. "
"4539240","4540080"," You guys want some cool shit?"
"4541840","4543160"," Here, I got some cool shit for you."
"4544880","4546380"," Oh yeah, I'll show you guys some cool shit."
"4550680","4552980"," You know, it's kind of messy right now, right?"
"4553140","4555360"," We've got the zigzag channels and all that kind of stuff. "
"4555820","4558400"," You know what I'll do is I'm going to get rid of the channels, okay?"
"4559080","4561400"," I'm going to, what is I'm going to do here?"
"4561640","4565200"," I'm going to get rid of the triggers here, right?"
"4566120","4568060"," So when you guys, you guys are going to get access to this, right?"
"4568100","4569240"," I'm going to remove this right here."
"4569760","4570200"," Right?"
"4570420","4571300"," I'm going to go to my indicators."
"4572020","4573600"," I'm going to go to my invite-only scripts. "
"4573960","4576100"," And I'm going to go with triggers without channels."
"4577160","4580240"," I'm going to close this up right here, right?"
"4580420","4581780"," So you can clean up the screener, okay?"
"4582460","4584440"," So we've got the triggers now with no channels."
"4585200","4586420"," Nice clean screen, right?"
"4587300","4588880"," We're on a one minute basis here. "
"4589820","4593080"," We've got our levels as well in here, right?"
"4593260","4593820"," Our pivot points."
"4594120","4596100"," But here, let's see, let's do something cool, okay?"
"4596560","4600120"," So follow my cursor as the goat would say, right?"
"4600640","4601660"," Mr. Yen, right?"
"4602040","4603680"," We're going to go over here and check this out over here."
"4603840","4606700"," So we're going to, we're going to turn that off, right?"
"4607600","4608960"," Now we're going to go to the pivots. "
"4610480","4612520"," Let me see here, pivots right here."
"4612960","4614640"," We're going to click on that bad boy right there."
"4615180","4616720"," And we're going to switch the pivot type. "
"4616840","4619580"," We're going to go from traditional pivots points, right?"
"4620140","4621680"," We're going to go to Fibonacci's, baby."
"4623200","4624400"," We'll go there right there."
"4624460","4625100"," We'll do some Fibonacci's. "
"4625100","4633020"," And now you've got Fibonacci, Fibonacci pivot levels instead of daily support."
"4633180","4637180"," A lot of you guys like to follow, E-Dub and all that kind of stuff."
"4637980","4642000"," And this shows you your actual Fibonacci levels here, okay?"
"4642660","4645500"," On an intraday basis, you can look at it on a 30 minute basis. "
"4645720","4647120"," You can look at it on a daily basis."
"4648000","4649520"," There's a 30 minute Fibonacci levels."
"4651700","4653480"," There's a daily Fibonacci levels. "
"4653480","4660970"," So if you want to check this stuff out on a daily basis, let's see if we can run these."
"4661170","4665790"," I think I might have to switch something in here on these pivots when I do the daily for it"
"4665790","4666230"," to calculate."
"4666770","4667870"," Yeah, it's like one day. "
"4667890","4669850"," I think I got to go with like a week or something like that."
"4669910","4670610"," Let's see if that works."
"4671990","4673310"," Let's see if that pumps them out. "
"4674170","4675790"," I think Tywin's second really quick."
"4676930","4677910"," Mom, baby, calculate."
"4679350","4680230"," Still not calculating. "
"4681250","4682210"," Hold on a second here."
"4682210","4684170"," I may be blind to you."
"4684990","4686110"," So this might not work. "
"4686250","4687190"," Let's check this one right here."
"4688830","4689690"," Let's see if this works."
"4690810","4692990"," Yeah, I'm going to have to look at this and write some rules for this. "
"4693510","4694970"," This one's not working right now."
"4695070","4696110"," I promise for you."
"4696350","4696870"," I don't know why. "
"4697490","4698170"," Now, okay."
"4698410","4700230"," It's saying that it's still saying that."
"4700330","4701010"," We're going to do something else. "
"4701150","4701870"," We're going to go back to traditional."
"4702950","4703310"," Right?"
"4704090","4705310"," And we're going to show you something else here."
"4705310","4712930"," So on the pivot points on the one minute basis right here, right?"
"4713610","4715930"," Go back to the one minute basis on the. "
"4716330","4718370"," I don't know why it's not calculating right now."
"4718430","4719510"," Now I'm all pissy about this."
"4719630","4720390"," I'm going to have to go back and look. "
"4721190","4725170"," I had a couple warnings earlier this morning telling me get, get fucked or something."
"4725410","4727690"," But these pivots showing right now."
"4728370","4731510"," Oh, yeah, I got to put that back to the one day. "
"4735430","4736710"," Here we go."
"4737610","4738710"," One quick second here."
"4741730","4742610"," One day. "
"4742930","4743290"," That right."
"4743730","4744210"," Here we go."
"4745130","4748650"," So on these pivots right here, right?"
"4751630","4755870"," If you are looking for an STX buy or sell. "
"4757690","4759890"," Can I clear off all of this stuff over here?"
"4759890","4761630"," A little less stuff."
"4762570","4770550"," If you wanted to on your pivots, you can add in R3 and R4 and R5."
"4770710","4776690"," And these are four and R5s and S4 and S5 are going to be green and red. "
"4778370","4780630"," And as a matter of fact, we hit this green section yesterday."
"4781370","4784790"," It's an auto buy and it's actually an auto sell on puts."
"4785870","4789050"," If we ever trade this range on an intraday basis. "
"4790310","4792730"," And the same thing would be on the upside."
"4794710","4798210"," If we trade a huge upside moving an intraday basis."
"4798730","4801490"," I don't know if you can see this on your screen, but there's two red lines up here. "
"4801930","4805450"," And this is more of a zone, not a line target."
"4806010","4808510"," As soon as we get into this zone here, it's more of a zone trade."
"4808510","4813870"," This is where algorithmic selling comes into play on this red. "
"4813990","4815050"," Let me make this red."
"4816710","4818550"," Algorithmic selling comes into play up here."
"4819330","4821190"," And I would make this a green box on the downside. "
"4821750","4826330"," So if price were to come up here, you would auto sell any position you were in, like a weekly"
"4826330","4827710"," basis, something like that."
"4828230","4830430"," You're in a swing trade and we trade it up there."
"4830550","4834670"," You would automatically sell and expect a downside to come. "
"4834890","4836690"," And the same thing would be on the inverse to the downside."
"4836690","4841130"," I'm not putting these on the chart right now because we're not trading into that range."
"4842610","4844410"," So I'm going to uncheck these. "
"4845150","4847990"," Now let's say press OK here."
"4848450","4850170"," Now let's say price were to go up here."
"4850630","4852050"," We're going to trade up here. "
"4852990","4856190"," And we actually sit on R3."
"4856750","4865650"," I would then go over here and turn on the upper zone in case we do trade up there."
"4865650","4867690"," So I know I could take my money and run, right?"
"4868050","4869890"," But until we get up there, I leave them. "
"4870090","4872310"," I don't want to clutter up the screen or any of that kind of stuff."
"4873450","4874330"," Let me see here."
"4874950","4879190"," Here we go back to the main screen here. "
"4879610","4885010"," A little bit cleaner here without the channels."
"4885650","4888970"," At least not an intraday trading kind of stuff here on the show."
"4889570","4894370"," If I was at home with my own big screen showing in front of me, I'd probably leave the channels"
"4894370","4899550"," on it with a more comfortable value become or leave the channels on. "
"4899670","4902590"," But for right now, we're just going to leave this just like that."
"4903990","4905090"," It's parked here."
"4905390","4910850"," Let's see if they can trade this up here and keep your eyes again on the down on this screen"
"4910850","4913890"," on the bottom side here and see how we're kind of parked right now. "
"4914570","4915350"," I'm going to move this over."
"4915550","4917190"," But this is where that gamma flip is."
"4917350","4918610"," So right here is the gamma flip. "
"4919230","4920550"," You can actually see it right here."
"4920550","4924010"," Notice how we still have demand in the marketplace, right?"
"4924410","4927730"," We got buyers still coming in on this gamma flip."
"4928810","4932870"," If you were really cheap, you'd be waiting down here to buy this as a bull. "
"4933510","4936170"," This is more risk on."
"4936390","4939290"," This is more conservative, right?"
"4939650","4942150"," And this is where bulls actually buy."
"4942450","4943830"," Bulls actually buy way up here. "
"4944570","4946970"," And they lose all their money because they're buying tops."
"4946970","4949070"," Bulls feel comfortable buying up here."
"4950190","4955290"," They hate buying right here, and they really hate buying down here. "
"4955490","4958870"," This is the inverse, your emotion trade right here."
"4959150","4960910"," You're buying this dip and this dip."
"4961030","4965070"," You buy the dip here, buy the fucking dip here, and you hate it. "
"4965270","4967290"," I already know you hate buying the dip here."
"4967390","4970610"," I already know you hate buying the dip even more down here."
"4970790","4972290"," Now, let's say we fail here. "
"4972690","4976770"," You buy the dip, you buy the fucking dip and it rolls down on you down here."
"4978370","4979850"," It starts to head down."
"4980050","4981950"," That's okay, you just manage your trade. "
"4982510","4984070"," So you get rolled down here, right?"
"4984290","4985170"," You've triggered your stops."
"4985730","4987970"," You took some, you're licking your wounds down here."
"4988450","4990610"," But this truly is where you're buying the dip. "
"4990750","4993710"," You want to put a weekly on, a monthly on, anything like that."
"4993910","4995050"," This is where you put the risk on."
"4995630","4999110"," You're the guy buying the dip down here, right?"
"4999290","5001070"," So you're like, oh, cap, I'm so scared. "
"5001830","5003270"," I bought the dip right here, bro."
"5003730","5004770"," I bought the dip right here, cap."
"5005490","5007930"," Like you told me, then it rolled down on me. "
"5008350","5009690"," I bought the dip again, cap."
"5010610","5012310"," And I'm really scared here, right?"
"5013710","5016190"," Now, there's some other things that are involved in this."
"5016350","5019470"," If you, there are other reasons you would not buy the dip down here. "
"5019490","5024990"," But right now, the current place or where we currently are in the market, you would, you would,"
"5025110","5026590"," should be buying the dip down here."
"5026670","5029630"," So let's say like, I bought, put some call spreads on cap, right?"
"5030710","5037650"," You're going to be the guy that's, when this thing rocket ships, you're going to hear the cacophony"
"5037650","5040370"," of bulls telling you to now buy the market."
"5040370","5044110"," They're going to be saying to, you know, noise everywhere. "
"5045310","5046870"," Are you going to join in and buy with us?"
"5046910","5048730"," You're like, bro, I'm exiting here."
"5049010","5049630"," You know what I'm saying?"
"5049990","5051210"," I have some runners on, man."
"5051470","5052290"," You want to buy some more?"
"5052430","5053690"," There's a mutton of room left in the bag. "
"5054070","5056490"," The truth is you were the guy that had the bag when it was empty."
"5056970","5057450"," Does that make sense?"
"5058350","5063830"," You have a higher rate or win rate down below, a higher win rate down below."
"5063830","5066130"," Then you do on the top side. "
"5066130","5067330"," I know this sounds counterintuitive."
"5068150","5071830"," And there are other mechanics that matter here that I don't talk about often."
"5071830","5072890"," Why are we talking about it often?"
"5074410","5078550"," But right now where the market is, we have no sign of CTA selling. "
"5079270","5081050"," We've got, we're not in negative gamma."
"5082150","5088690"," We're not, we don't have any catalyst in the, on the outside of the market, any kind of economic"
"5088690","5090830"," news catalyst, any of that kind of stuff."
"5091030","5092090"," We're still in earnings season. "
"5092550","5099070"," We haven't rejected the gamma flip, meaning fleet two or three times, any of that kind of stuff."
"5099630","5105230"," So there's nothing here saying why we should crash at this moment right now right here."
"5105810","5109290"," So this is a risk on environment for bulls here, by the way. "
"5110190","5110650"," All right."
"5110910","5112650"," That's all I got for you at the moment, back with you in just a moment."
"5113650","5114930"," Oh, let's talk Tesla really quick. "
"5115750","5117130"," Let's take five minutes to talk about Tesla."
"5117930","5120750"," I want to, I'm going to give you guys something here."
"5121090","5126910"," Very, I want to be very clear here about Tesla because I see a lot of people on Twitter. "
"5127610","5129550"," I don't know what the fuck they're talking about."
"5130070","5132330"," And it really bothers me."
"5132990","5133850"," It does. "
"5134090","5143990"," It really bothers me because a lot of that noise comes from people that either, you"
"5143990","5148250"," know, they're fucking trade in a thousand dollar account that they blow up every week."
"5149310","5154610"," Or they have a cost dollar cost basis of five bucks from 10 years ago."
"5154910","5157190"," And they want you to always buy. "
"5157390","5160070"," They want to sell calls to you, all kinds of nefarious shit."
"5160870","5164950"," Some people feel peer pressure to say always by the dip, whatever, all that kind of stuff."
"5165430","5169330"," Some people are just feeding into the emotions of bulls and that kind of stuff. "
"5169530","5171970"," So we're going to talk about Tesla really quick."
"5173370","5178130"," And I made some commentary past few weeks when making commentary."
"5178770","5183730"," And then I made some other commentary saying bad news is coming. "
"5185230","5188170"," And you are expected."
"5188970","5192550"," I even said I didn't want to say that a few days ago."
"5193030","5194570"," I'm going to say it today on stream. "
"5194830","5195790"," This was about a week ago."
"5196590","5198030"," And then of course bad news came."
"5198030","5203130"," And then of course I see talking molds and faces on fintuit. "
"5203610","5206070"," Saying that we're burning because of that news."
"5206690","5211810"," If that was the case, then why the fuck that I know the bad news was coming."
"5213110","5216970"," And that's because the market trades not too new. "
"5217170","5219610"," Some of it is to the news, but it always reverts back."
"5220690","5224190"," That's that's most unknown news to anybody."
"5224750","5232110"," And even when it's really unknown, we tend to revert that trade because the powers that be are"
"5232110","5234370"," actually in a longer, short position. "
"5234790","5239250"," They didn't already know the outcome or the event that was taking place."
"5240150","5241730"," So anyways, my point here is this."
"5241890","5243230"," This is what I want to talk to you guys about. "
"5243910","5246770"," Important thing that I want to talk to you guys about right now here."
"5247350","5249610"," We're going to do a little chat here."
"5249610","5253090"," And we're going to talk to Tesla here. "
"5254050","5257790"," Now normally under normal circumstances."
"5259790","5264950"," I would be auto buying this bottom here on daily trigger."
"5266130","5269330"," Normally I would be a buyer down here with some spreads. "
"5270690","5272490"," Like shares spreads don't care."
"5273590","5278130"," And it hits 95% of the time buying this dip down here."
"5279290","5282830"," Even with all the bullshit and the bleeding and all this kind of stuff. "
"5283110","5283870"," It doesn't really matter."
"5284090","5287390"," You just buy the you auto fucking buy this dip and it prints."
"5288210","5288530"," Okay. "
"5288930","5290670"," Nor is under normal circumstances."
"5291630","5298350"," I would say that is true, but there's some more information that I'm looking for here."
"5299070","5305170"," And that big information that I'm looking for here is this right here. "
"5306950","5312610"," I did not see like over here did not see the daily trigger cross the monthly."
"5313170","5313630"," Okay."
"5314290","5315570"," The big big one down here. "
"5315690","5315830"," Okay."
"5316850","5318730"," Did not cross the monthly down here."
"5319170","5323750"," I have real concern with the daily trigger crossing the weekly back here. "
"5324430","5327230"," Crossing the monthly trigger right here."
"5328350","5332110"," And this set up specifically notice the difference in this."
"5332930","5337770"," And the violence in the swing lower with the daily trigger. "
"5337770","5338290"," Okay."
"5338570","5342450"," This whole cluster right here is extremely bearish."
"5342470","5344330"," As a matter of fact weeks ago. "
"5344930","5350150"," I was on been to it and said I'm hoping for at least a back test of 232."
"5353170","5356530"," Before we enter a bear market for Tesla."
"5357530","5358910"," We didn't quite get there. "
"5359030","5359310"," Did we?"
"5359310","5362450"," It auto sold and just started raining hell down."
"5362750","5366370"," Then we got a bunch of really bad news all kinds of crap and shit like that."
"5366810","5368110"," And it was a hot fucking mess. "
"5368410","5368470"," Right."
"5368710","5369870"," Then we get all kinds of shit."
"5369990","5370110"," Right. "
"5370330","5371530"," Just bad bad bad bad bad."
"5371690","5373950"," Now why do I why do I not like this?"
"5374190","5379010"," Why do I think that why did I think bad news come because this is predicting it before it ever"
"5379010","5385310"," happens was actually predicting it even before predicting it back here on the 18th."
"5385310","5386610"," Right there. "
"5386630","5391530"," There was actually a hint of it back here too because we had a rejection below daily trigger here."
"5391990","5392150"," Okay."
"5393050","5397890"," So you had like a pre warning major warning guaranteed it's going to happen right here. "
"5397890","5401410"," And I guarantee bad news is coming and then fucking bam."
"5402110","5402330"," Okay."
"5402850","5408210"," So, you know, you're getting some predictive behavior from this stuff. "
"5408350","5408450"," Right."
"5408970","5413970"," Now, what am I looking now once this happens and we're down here and I see that we're at the"
"5413970","5418450"," bottom of negative loss in the daily basis and there's a rule here to buy this dip."
"5419470","5423350"," I want to just check back because of how bad this looks right here. "
"5423410","5424690"," This looks terrible right here."
"5425230","5430870"," That daily cross of the monthly, whatever price is below the monthly, that stock is in a bear"
"5430870","5431710"," market technically."
"5432350","5437150"," And whenever that daily crosses down with that violence and the violence in that move, right, the"
"5437150","5439790"," violence in the move, it's not it's not slowly going down. "
"5440370","5442590"," It's going down almost in a vertical line."
"5442590","5442810"," What?"
"5442930","5444410"," Look at that daily trigger."
"5444670","5447290"," It's like it's violently moving down right now. "
"5447310","5449370"," See that the violence in this move right now."
"5449670","5450430"," It's rolling."
"5450770","5451510"," It's not turning up. "
"5451510","5456510"," Is it see this this violence and move it's not coming down and flattening out."
"5457050","5462690"," It's not not it's not like prices coming down and the daily trigger didn't follow."
"5463450","5463910"," Right. "
"5464410","5468190"," So I'm going to look back and some history here and see if there's any prior examples of this."
"5468190","5472330"," And what I found was that there are some prior examples of that."
"5472990","5477190"," So in your brain, see the violence, see the violence here of that cross. "
"5477930","5481310"," See how see how you like on a daily basis right now, right."
"5482650","5486330"," You see how you see how this this daily trigger never crossed."
"5486750","5487510"," Did it?"
"5487850","5494990"," It didn't follow price down and it bounced before ever breaching this monthly trigger. "
"5495710","5497070"," But what's different here, right?"
"5497070","5500610"," We've got violence in move and a cross of the monthly trigger."
"5501110","5505990"," That's telling me not to buy the dip right now and I'm going to be looking for something here as"
"5505990","5506190"," well."
"5506770","5508610"," So right now we've got a cross of the daily trigger. "
"5509290","5510970"," We have the weekly about to cross."
"5511170","5514810"," This is considered a major bearish crossover."
"5515310","5520030"," We've got a three trigger monthly weekly and daily cross to the downside here. "
"5520150","5520330"," Okay."
"5520990","5521730"," That's shaping up."
"5521890","5525630"," So I want to look at a prior example of that and what happened. "
"5525630","5527030"," We have a couple."
"5527730","5529250"," We've got one right here."
"5531190","5539130"," That sent us to $1.02, I believe, $1.03. Let's look back at another example in your brain, remember"
"5539130","5539950"," something, okay?"
"5540510","5546070"," Weekly daily cross of the monthly trigger, weekly daily cross of monthly trigger. "
"5546710","5548730"," That's another last time we had that happen."
"5551100","5553820"," Weekly monthly cross of that trigger."
"5553820","5555620"," Here's another one example right here. "
"5556700","5558700"," This is back in 2019."
"5560400","5561640"," It was ugly."
"5562400","5563620"," Here's one right here. "
"5563820","5564540"," I remember this."
"5564760","5569580"," I was trading this back then, okay, when Tesla price was low."
"5570180","5572020"," Here's another example of it right here. "
"5572140","5574760"," We've got another cross down here."
"5575280","5576780"," Really violent moves, right?"
"5577320","5578800"," Our daily cross is down here."
"5578940","5582180"," The weekly didn't, but we still had another major down move. "
"5582180","5585660"," So right now, this one actually could get the squeeze right here, right?"
"5586140","5586880"," To the upside."
"5587200","5589920"," But look at the violence and just the daily move to the downside."
"5590700","5591720"," It was huge. "
"5592500","5595980"," This price right here is $9.51, right?"
"5596600","5598040"," This is the high right here."
"5598140","5599120"," This was 1915."
"5600320","5606380"," That's a 50% drawdown without even getting the cross of the weekly trigger right here. "
"5606520","5609640"," 50% drawdown in price."
"5610520","5614140"," 50% on its previous high drawdown in price."
"5614980","5616060"," Let's take a look right here. "
"5616300","5617660"," Our previous high was right here."
"5618660","5619340"," $295."
"5620560","5623480"," That puts us at minimum at $150. "
"5625380","5626740"," Minimum, $150."
"5627440","5629780"," This quarterly triggers that $162."
"5630400","5637840"," Would not be shocked for a minute to see Tesla price hit that 50% mark down here at minimum. "
"5638480","5643100"," And if you get the cross of the weekly right here, that's just the daily cross."
"5643660","5649220"," If we get the cross of the weekly, would not be shocked at all to see that major move down"
"5649620","5655260"," for a yearly low in the S&P 500 in NASDAQ down here in the quarterly trigger."
"5655500","5656860"," And that closes a bunch of gaps. "
"5657880","5660740"," Currently, that's sitting at $68 down here."
"5661280","5665620"," So I made a post just the other day yesterday, I think."
"5666860","5674620"," Can't recall exactly, but maybe I might have been yesterday where I said, normally, I would be a"
"5674620","5681440"," Tesla buyer here, but I would really like to see us above $232. "
"5684120","5688180"," We are currently trading $197."
"5688180","5698640"," So I would literally want to see price first, get"
"5698640","5701000"," above $232 right here."
"5701820","5708580"," And then we'll talk bullishness, that would mean we come back, believe it or not, consolidate here"
"5708580","5716240"," and wait for the hourly trigger to come up, the daily trigger to come up, and even then back test"
"5716240","5720980"," this stuff successfully, beat this prior high at $232. "
"5721660","5725700"," And then we'll start talking about Tesla being a buy again."
"5726360","5730800"," So there's some real bad shit going on down here with Tesla right now."
"5731200","5739960"," And I'm promising you that as a Tesla bull, you putting risk on right here, I would say to you,"
"5739960","5744800"," I would say to you here, yeah, I get buying the dip down here. "
"5744800","5753400"," And it will come back, but just note that this is one of those places on, specifically on Tesla."
"5754500","5756440"," And look at that, we're coming back already on spy."
"5757320","5758240"," What do you know?"
"5759040","5766640"," So what I would say too about Tesla here is, it's not that you can't buy the dip here, it's"
"5766640","5775280"," that you need your, you're buying the dip on Tesla must account for a trip lower. "
"5775840","5778140"," And there's a high probability of it happening."
"5778140","5786680"," So that would mean what, if you're going to buy shares that you don't sell your shares, that you"
"5786680","5792280"," actually diamond him them for when we come back up to where you bought them when we went down from"
"5792280","5792580"," here."
"5792580","5793040"," Okay. "
"5793600","5801660"," If you bought spreads that you put enough time on them to account for a trip lower that you have"
"5801660","5804460"," the ability to withstand that downside move."
"5804680","5811520"," I'm all, I'm all for one for buying dips on Tesla lows, but just know what you're getting into is"
"5811520","5812340"," my point here."
"5812980","5819240"," Like, but they think and you're going to buy like a weekly or a monthly Tesla fucking calls way"
"5819240","5824000"," outside the money for a dollar and they're going to guarantee to print this time. "
"5824140","5831520"," Not so much with the momentum coming down on the daily and weekly basis price being underneath the"
"5831520","5831800"," monthly."
"5832260","5838760"," If price was above those things and we were at the bottoming out of daily velocity on Tesla, I'd be"
"5838760","5840380"," like fucking full port."
"5841020","5847060"," Capy's going to go full port with month out calls outside the money and I'm going to make a 10 "
"5847060","5849020",",000% banger here guaranteed. "
"5851100","5852380"," Does that make sense?"
"5854340","5859300"," So you can buy the dip here in Tesla, you know, you got some consolidation next couple weeks."
"5859760","5865060"," Another thing to consider here with Tesla too that's another negative for Tesla is we are coming"
"5865060","5869800"," into a seasonal market weakness."
"5872280","5874820"," Now, I'm not going to go into the rest of this right now. "
"5874820","5880800"," I'm not talking too long, different concepts, but I want to talk to you about something here and"
"5880800","5890780"," that is that the QRA announced that came out yesterday, okay, the issuance"
"5890780","5895220"," announcement that came out yesterday was not extremely bullish."
"5895380","5897800"," That's where we go straight vertical for the rest of the year."
"5898480","5900620"," It was not bearish or hawkish. "
"5900960","5901740"," It was neutral."
"5902260","5906520"," It was a nothing burger, okay, that's when it was a nothing burger."
"5907040","5910100"," What does that mean we should expect this year?"
"5911100","5915640"," So I'm going to show you guys something here really quick, one quick, oh, no, we do it just like"
"5915640","5925340"," this and you know who can speak to this with me would be likely trader podcast probably has some"
"5925340","5926700"," insight on this as well. "
"5926700","5933940"," So I will defer to him to some extent on this because he is doing some great work here, okay?"
"5934360","5941900"," We're going to go to a copy screen here and we're going to talk about what's needed."
"5943200","5949000"," What is actually needed is you wanted that announcement yesterday."
"5949700","5954340"," So this is the path that I believe we are going to follow this year, okay?"
"5954980","5962480"," Now if that quarterly announcement that came out yesterday, we would likely have traded like this"
"5962480","5963200"," like vertical. "
"5964080","5965040"," No stops."
"5965860","5971580"," And even if we did have a stop it would be something like violence and straight back up."
"5972100","5976180"," We're talking like a week or two correction and then violence straight up in the end of the year. "
"5976960","5981400"," Now that we know it's more neutral, it's not bearish either hawkish."
"5981400","5986580"," I expect us to follow this track more closely."
"5987500","5993720"," We're coming back into following into line with this expectation for the year, at least my"
"5993720","5996300"," perspective, my thesis, okay?"
"5996740","6004040"," So if that's the case, what do we expect for this this seasonal chart for this year?"
"6004600","6011020"," We know that we're going to probably have a massive bull run that lasts into the end of the year"
"6011020","6013100"," and into March of next year. "
"6013620","6017840"," This shit should go off the charts into next year, okay?"
"6018280","6024300"," And the other thing that we have to know right now is that we're going to expect a seasonal low,"
"6025000","6026080"," a seasonal low."
"6026200","6028300"," We're not there yet, right?"
"6028580","6029920"," But we're getting close to it, right?"
"6030140","6039180"," We do some jaggedness and then we roll down for an unexpected seasonal roll coming down into when."
"6040340","6043680"," We got the 57th trading day, right?"
"6044260","6051540"," I got to turn my camera on, hold on here, god damn it, I got to turn my camera on"
"6051540","6051760"," here. "
"6053580","6056260"," I guess we are going to get into it for a little bit today, hold on."
"6058960","6060960"," Let's break out our calendars, right?"
"6061640","6070790"," Come on man, turn this thing on, turn this fucking camera on, I apologize for my parents, I just"
"6070790","6075550"," got out of the shower here, but hold on, come on now, let's see if we can do it."
"6075830","6077090"," All right, let's see if we can do this here. "
"6077870","6082870"," Talking directly to viewers, no memory card, that's because we got a Sony, all right, here we go."
"6085170","6088810"," All right, so we're going to look here, this is my men's calendar, okay?"
"6090070","6094270"," We're going to look for the 57th trading day, sorry for my hair, I'd usually brush it and all that."
"6094270","6103630"," But we've got our sexy hot men calendar here, sexy hot men of, sexy hot men of March baby, right"
"6103630","6103950"," there. "
"6104430","6108870"," It kind of looks like David AMS, David AMS is a handsome guy in real life, I don't know if"
"6108870","6115610"," you guys know that, but where's the 57th trading day, I don't know if you can see that right there,"
"6116470","6121230"," there you go, it's March 22nd, March 22nd, right?"
"6122090","6132130"," So, let's go back to the trigger screen, we'll"
"6132130","6139970"," be here calling guys sexy and stuff, you know, it shouldn't be doing that, it's like harassment,"
"6140670","6144170"," I'm comfortable, I'm comfortable with sexuality."
"6145750","6149390"," So if you, if we're going to look at that season, let me go back to that season, I'll try"
"6149390","6149890"," really quick."
"6151910","6159210"," So, if we look at that seasonality chart, right, you're going to expect some kind of a roll or zone"
"6159210","6165990"," trading, right, and then our eventual roll down into March 22nd. "
"6167450","6174130"," We always talk about seasonality calendars, how we can trade outside of them, we have years where"
"6174130","6179550"," we blast up and outside of the range, we have years where we have a bear market, we trade all"
"6179550","6185270"," the way down, but right now we're still following, we have moments a day or a week where we trade"
"6185270","6189930"," outside of that range, but look at what's happening right now, we went a little bit lower down"
"6189930","6196430"," here, right, came back in line, right, a little bit lower, this was in line, and then we traded"
"6196430","6200810"," outside the range, but look what we're doing, we're pulling right back down into that range, right,"
"6201330","6208010"," but just like look at this right here, so far this year, kind of, kind of on track aren't we,"
"6208190","6214070"," kind of still on track, does that make sense?"
"6215350","6222070"," So, there's going to be some kind of an expectation still of a roll down into March 22nd, now can"
"6222070","6228010"," we squeeze up here and go down there, sure, can we roll down early, sure, but"
"6228010","6238530"," you need Tesla, you're talking about buying a dip on Tesla, right,"
"6239110","6244250"," you might get that dip buy here, you got a bunch of bulls down here saying this is SPX, but"
"6244250","6248390"," you know, Tesla bulls going yeah buy that fucking dip, right, so you're fucking out there buying"
"6248390","6253630"," this dip, and you're thinking yeah, correction over, everything's fucking awesome, woo,"
"6253910","6261090"," everything's fucking great, and in reality your Tesla dip buy was down here in March 22nd, okay, so"
"6261090","6267450"," be aware of market awareness, and that dip buy you're talking about, when you're like hey I'm going"
"6267450","6271870"," to buy the dip here, it is low, I'm going to buy it, but then all of a sudden you"
"6271870","6278710"," see Tesla at fucking trading $78 down here, and don't disappear from my stream, I'm going to come"
"6278710","6284990"," back and say hey cap you were right, okay, you guys get what I'm saying, so your actual dip buy"
"6284990","6289010"," may have been down here, the other thing would be if you're like well cap, if I don't put any"
"6289010","6292830"," risk on, what if we don't have that deep of it, what if it's like, what if Tesla just does"
"6292830","6298210"," this, well the market goes down, I should have bought that fucking dip buy, well put enough time on"
"6298210","6304710"," that trade, making a spread that ends in the height of summer, making a spread that ends at the end"
"6304710","6310350"," of the year, make it make sense, maybe you're buying the dip with the underlying stock on Tesla"
"6310350","6317070"," down here in weakness, and then you just DCA down here, you don't go 100% buy here, you spend"
"6317070","6324010"," 20%, 30%, you guys remember this from when we're at $34.50 right, any of you long time watchers"
"6324010","6331170"," know that I was telling you in summertime, in May and June, buy the dip, October, buy the dip,"
"6332390","6337690"," right, and do 30% of the market buy here, 30% of the market buy here, leave some ammunition,"
"6338510","6345750"," the chances of us rolling down even farther are 5%, right, so if you do want to buy a Tesla"
"6345750","6350090"," buy here and this isn't going to be as deep as sure, but buy some here and then DCA this"
"6350090","6354510"," here and boom you're off and running for the rest of the year, you know you're going to take the"
"6354510","6358830"," money and run over here, or I'm going to have another conversation with you and say exit your"
"6358830","6367730"," fucking Tesla longs and we'll jump in again and go up here, make sense, in the chat stream, oh yeah"
"6367730","6374670"," baby, I know none of you guys get any love at home from your wives by the way, I'll give"
"6374670","6384530"," you love here on the stream okay, I know women don't love you, some of you are all"
"6384530","6392850"," creepy so I'll show you love, what do you say like, no sexuality or anything but I'll show you"
"6392850","6400990"," love, so you feel like I care about you, I'll"
"6400990","6408810"," hold you but jukebox come up, poke the jukebox come on over here, I love you too mr."
"6409010","6418830"," Tock and monkey, Dean I love you too, outhouse I love you, so just just remember, what happens"
"6418830","6425210"," on that March op-ex, right, if you look back on a seasonality or on a JPM, if you look"
"6425210","6432750"," on a JPM, I have the JPM, I have it here, I will post it today, if you watch the"
"6432750","6439610"," JPM caller, we tend to hit our target and then like a week or two before we roll the other"
"6439610","6445590"," way, does that make sense, so let's say you get the caller trade, let's say you get the caller"
"6445590","6455530"," trade, hold on, we'll just do it right now, anyway, no we don't do, I'll switch back to this cap"
"6455530","6462390"," screener, so if you track, I'll post this, I'll post the JPM caller results for the past nine or"
"6462390","6467090"," ten or twelve whatever's, but let's say we go down here and we hit the bottom of the caller in"
"6467090","6475570"," the 22nd, right, that's that 3800 or whatever, or I think the next strike is, I don't care"
"6475570","6484170"," if it's the but the last two weeks we normally bounce, we ricochet off, so this is normal for the"
"6484170","6490710"," end of a quarter to catch a bounce ten days before that direction, that expected direction, matter"
"6490710","6495210"," of fact, let's go look at it right now as a team, okay, let's look at it as a team"
"6495210","6507490"," right now, so we're fucking team today, god damn it, we all out here, I"
"6507490","6516170"," love the, I love the JPM caller here, boys and girls,"
"6516650","6527790"," right, oh dude, look at that, oh yeah baby, oh"
"6527790","6533370"," yeah baby, you guys have seen this before, right, ha ha"
"6533370","6544450"," ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha I"
"6544450","6552450"," actually have screenshots of this before this price action, but look at that, near perfect right,"
"6552870","6561850"," look at that, near fucking perfect, now the seasonality calendar is saying what, that we're gonna"
"6561850","6571110"," do this right, consolidate and blast down, our low may be here into end of March, might just be"
"6571110","6577230"," down here, might be a slow run down here, and then you ricochet off, right, but it could be down"
"6577230","6582130"," here, couldn't it, could be down here, couldn't it, do you know what date this is planned for, you"
"6582130","6592310"," want the date for this, get your calendars out at home, that's the 39th trade day, so"
"6592310","6608050"," the expectation would be, hold on a second, am I gonna calendar again, hold on, that's"
"6608050","6627380"," the 27th of February, and"
"6627380","6636980"," that is the 22nd, right, ooh, this would be the actual"
"6636980","6645750"," calendar seasonality expectation, worst case scenario,"
"6646370","6656090"," this would be worst case scenario in the collar, now this could be, so this right here, could"
"6656090","6665710"," be more like this, okay, where you'd have, you'd have something like a low right here, I'll just"
"6665710","6698120"," draw it in, hold on, this would be the two outcomes, okay, make sense,"
"6698680","6708500"," now we can pop the collar, I'm you know, going up here and going crazy, so far though it's"
"6708500","6712720"," working isn't it, so far that's pretty good right there isn't it, and I want you to know something"
"6712720","6719420"," else, this is the truth, we more often than not do not pop the collar on the upside or the"
"6719420","6729380"," downside, they are anomalies not the norm, they are the anomaly not the norm, and"
"6729380","6736820"," they have free puts right now to the downside, at this point they will have free put, they're"
"6736820","6741480"," monetizing right up here right, we know they're monetizing up here to buy that protection for the"
"6741480","6751400"," downside, so yeah, there we go, and I've got the dates right here for you, they are the actual"
"6751400","6759520"," dates right there, so we'll be watching this play out into the end of the quarter here,"
"6759520","6769180"," so this seasonality calendar is matching"
"6769180","6779500"," to this seasonality calendar this year, is matching to an on election year, or"
"6779500","6789060"," that's added to this calendar right here, have I ever filtered the seasonality to match"
"6789060","6796280"," only following years of 20% gains, I have the one from last year, I'll show it to you, we"
"6796280","6805320"," traded it almost exactly, almost perfect, last year's seasonality calendar I will post that at some"
"6805320","6810540"," point, I had posted it a few times, but over the time at the moment, but yes we still track"
"6810540","6825500"," exactly, and we had a 20, 23 percent, 23 percent year or something like that, there's"
"6825500","6832640"," no guarantees, and I got to say, so let's talk about that again, this is a good one, let's go"
"6832640","6838360"," with the cap, if you ever filtered the seasonality, no, no, what was the question here?"
"6838360","6849160"," Yeah, so first off, Larry Williams cycle predicts market sell-off from here to April, so"
"6849160","6857440"," we just looked at the expectation of being range bound with a roll down into March 22nd, that fits"
"6857440","6865380"," that thesis of Larry Williams, but someone else asked a question here, someone just asked an"
"6865380","6875300"," important question here, someone else asked a question that was"
"6875300","6885040"," important here that I wanted to answer for you guys, I don't know what it was, at any rate,"
"6887640","6897030"," what was it, it's an important question, yeah, you know, if you've got another seasonality"
"6897030","6904750"," calendar, I would say, are they showing you current price action, do you guys want to see, oh you"
"6904750","6908610"," guys maybe you guys want to see last year's seasonality count, you want to see it, fucking we'll"
"6908610","6915410"," look at it, we'll fucking look at it right now, and I'll show you the proof, I want to see"
"6915410","6925190"," their last year's seasonality calendar, the last thing in here, one quick"
"6925190","6933340"," second here, and I'll show you last year's seasonality calendar, hold on here,"
"6935600","6945200"," bring this up right now, bring"
"6945200","6955240"," this up right now, I got, I got, I got my proof, right"
"6955240","6964960"," here, can I uh, snip it maybe,"
"6968020","6978810"," new, let's talk back testing, uh, this"
"6978810","6986190"," is uh, I got, this is one here, I can't show you that because that's my back into my website"
"6986190","7006800"," here, and can"
"7006800","7018040"," I bring it up here, right there, open the snipping tool, snipping tool, there"
"7020890","7034010"," we go, hold on here, where is,"
"7034370","7044290"," uh, it is again, hold on one second here, where is that gallery, there it is right there, there"
"7044290","7055630"," we go, let's put it, let's put it right here, can I"
"7055630","7067650"," make this bigger, there we go, nope, hold on, we should be able to see that there, this"
"7067650","7077270"," is last year's seasonality calendar, so you know, a little bit of"
"7077270","7084370"," outsized moves, but generally speaking, following, right, a little bit of outsized moved into the"
"7084370","7088390"," end of the year last year, right, we had a little bit of divergence here, a little bit of upside"
"7088390","7094510"," move there, but otherwise, I'd say that's pretty good, I mean if you think about, if you think"
"7094510","7099950"," about a lot of the calls that are made out there, if you think about, like let's think about this,"
"7099950","7105730"," right, you know, a lot of people out there that are calling for this and that and this and that,"
"7106050","7113590"," think about all the noise that you heard last year, and this is fairly close, right, we didn't get"
"7113590","7121310"," the big crash, did we, right, so this market's going up into the right, uh, you know, it's fairly"
"7121310","7127690"," good seasonality calendar, um, so like when you're, when you're in the zone trading a five minute"
"7127690","7131890"," or a 50 minute chart and you're listening to somebody out there telling you this doom and gloom is"
"7131890","7138170"," coming or that, doom and gloom is coming, um, on a, on a year time frame, it's not looking like"
"7138170","7142550"," that, is it, you know, you see, like, I'm not going to name names out there, but you see these"
"7142550","7149550"," fucks come out, see these fucks come out and they're like, doom, we're going to zero, right, boom,"
"7150170","7155910"," we're going to zero, right, boom, we're going to zero, right, that's not the case, is it, there was"
"7155910","7161890"," your seasonal low, this low was higher, right, and this low back here, we never, all, all you were"
"7161890","7169690"," looking for was dips to buy, weren't you, dips to buy, dips to buy, um, so anyways, uh, what else,"
"7170690","7177570"," main screen here, uh, there's the role that comes down, remember that that, remember that we don't"
"7177570","7187850"," expect that role until, uh, the 30 second or 31st trading day of the year, though"
"7187850","7193890"," we've had a pretty decent kick ass, pretty decent kick ass start to the year, so if it did go"
"7193890","7200910"," sideways and down, um, if the trading, I wouldn't be shocked at trading action like this, and then"
"7200910","7205810"," the role, uh, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be shocked if we traded early down there, but you know the"
"7205810","7214660"," general, general idea of where we should head, uh, into the end of quarter this year, all right,"
"7214680","7215620"," all right, here we go."
"7217340","7219880"," Oh, how's that, how's that spooze doing by the way?"
"7221380","7222700"," Oh, look at that, huh?"
"7223660","7232280"," Oh, trade the coil, I don't want to cap, it's gonna crash,"
"7232920","7245580"," trade the coil, I don't want to cap, all"
"7245580","7251740"," right, I'll be back with you guys again in a little bit, uh, who just subscribed, JT River, thank"
"7251740","7253080"," you brother, appreciate it."
"7256460","7261460"," Look at that, look at that dip buying, with that dip buying down there on that, on that, on that"
"7261460","7262620"," gamma flip down there. "
"7267680","7270700"," Oh, right on, thanks for the resub, I appreciate it."
"7271460","7273200"," I appreciate it."
"7275420","7278000"," Uh, yeah, hold on a second here. "
"7283480","7287900"," If we look at Apple really quick, yeah, we can look at Apple really quick."
"7288740","7291140"," I'm gonna put it in the cycle, how about that, okay?"
"7292200","7294260"," So I'm gonna do a cycle for you here, hold on."
"7296000","7297920"," I'm just gonna put it on the screen for you. "
"7308590","7311250"," All right, so we're gonna do Apple, I got you Sam."
"7312130","7314390"," Sam, I apologize for not calling you man."
"7315130","7318170"," Hey, Sam, I want you to know that I appreciate the text messages brother. "
"7318950","7324670"," I just have that, I have had no time man, but I mean like none, I've got no free time"
"7324670","7325190"," to be chatting."
"7325190","7330750"," Um, Apple, toiling right now."
"7333210","7336150"," Uh, the one minute chart here, we're gonna go to the 30 minute chart. "
"7337470","7343400"," Uh, Apple, hold on here, we're switching already."
"7344280","7347420"," Whoa, whoa, whoa, man, whoa, Apple."
"7348740","7350080"," Uh, let me see here. "
"7350280","7356640"," I think, I think Apple's range bound, uh, take money and run right just by looking at it."
"7357960","7362280"," Uh, range bound, take the money and run."
"7364020","7367720"," It's tied right in, just a second here. "
"7372640","7376320"," Uh, nice dip buy down here for you, this is a 30 minute chart on Apple."
"7378220","7380720"," It's got a nice little V shape recovery down here."
"7381460","7384760"," Could see a nice little run into the close today on Apple, this looks gorgeous by the way. "
"7384760","7390420"," You do need to get above, uh, 186.33. Be aware of that."
"7390880","7393480"," This is where the trap is for bulls into their earnings."
"7394340","7399720"," So you guys are all gonna be all, you know, all fucking bear, bold up, I should say. "
"7400560","7409420"," When in reality, reality, you need to see price get above 186.33. You need to see a price get"
"7409420","7411640"," above it and then you can take along."
"7412300","7414000"," Otherwise, you're just buying the dips down here."
"7415620","7417260"," Um, but you need to get above it. "
"7417380","7422780"," There's, if I had to guess here, uh, you're gonna get all bold up today on Apple and they're gonna"
"7422780","7427080"," trap the fuck out of you down here, uh, into the close."
"7427740","7432640"," And then even if you get a good report, uh, you might be able to break some of this stuff"
"7432640","7438340"," up down here, like you might trade 187, uh, maybe close the gap above here."
"7439100","7443200"," My price target would be 189, uh, upside expectations. "
"7443200","7450840"," I'd prefer to zone trade this between the hourly and the, um, daily trigger or buy this previous"
"7450840","7458880"," low and trade it and get out at 186.33. Uh, one other thing about Apple today, uh, I used"
"7458880","7461000"," to trade Apple, uh, shit ton."
"7462860","7469800"," And whenever you come into their earnings, the last day, uh, the options tend to collapse down on"
"7469800","7474340"," each other into the end of the day and they end up trapping you into a trade and you end"
"7474340","7477340"," up getting stuck, uh, into holding through their earnings."
"7477520","7479580"," So be really careful here on Apple. "
"7479720","7489020"," So this is Apple, uh, 30 minute chart."
"7493670","7494770"," Squeezing up right now."
"7494770","7503410"," If you're a long Apple here, you take the money coming into 186.33. You also have a, uh, a"
"7503410","7510370"," level, uh, R1 at 186.21. Uh, you can reenter above after consolidation. "
"7512710","7517010"," Look at that beauty right there."
"7517290","7527210"," Whoa, baby got that beautiful range expansion in here going"
"7527210","7528950"," on on spy right now."
"7529610","7536150"," Take the money and run reenter the trade in a successful back test of the hourly trigger. "
"7536930","7539750"," A successful back test of the hourly trigger."
"7541210","7543850"," Remember that you want to see a successful back test."
"7544350","7546490"," Would not be shocked to see us come back down. "
"7546870","7552390"," Your next upside target, 491, 16."
"7553130","7555690"," Though we do have some shit to clear up back here."
"7556890","7560150"," I'm going to draw that in right there for you right up there. "
"7560510","7563670"," Right there."
"7566150","7567770"," Right up in there, draw that in."
"7571550","7574630"," So, uh, temporary target right there. "
"7582670","7584410"," Get that right there for you."
"7586410","7591990"," If you are bullish here, you want to see some kind of pullback confirmation."
"7593250","7594610"," Well, it wouldn't look like that. "
"7594710","7595610"," It would look like this."
"7597150","7599250"," Up here, back down."
"7599850","7601890"," And then you take that trade right there. "
"7602450","7602810"," Bam, bam."
"7603370","7605450"," And you attack your next level to the upside."
"7610160","7613640"," Remember what I said to you about that seasonality calendar. "
"7614680","7618060"," Could be range, bound, trade and sideways for a bit."
"7619040","7639520"," Well, for"
"7639520","7642700"," their, uh, for their vision headsets, not in the least."
"7643000","7645300"," I think that they've already made their bet there. "
"7645480","7646860"," They can't be hat with their bet."
"7647080","7650320"," They're not going to count on Apple with $3,500 headset to leave."
"7650780","7655160"," And in terms of Apple, if I could, Scott, nobody mentioned that China has cut back. "
"7655400","7657320"," China said, you're a firing player."
"7657640","7658940"," We don't want you selling to government."
"7659300","7662160"," Does that spread as new phones continue to pick up?"
"7662500","7669500"," So to me, Apple was the poster child for just a way to, you know, bullish 2023. "
"7669840","7670320"," When the funny."
"7673560","7676120"," Joshua, Joshua, VA, yes."
"7677480","7680240"," I'm going to send you a text or something. "
"7680380","7680540"," Hold on."
"7681040","7682180"," We'll mean, what's up, brother?"
"7682940","7683920"," We'll end what up, brother."
"7692220","7697220"," But I don't know how much people will care because it just seems to be an ending thirst by it. "
"7697320","7697540"," Okay."
"7697680","7699900"," We're going to leave Apple because I wanted to move to meta, obviously."
"7700140","7702220"," Sarat, you own, uh, meta. "
"7702720","7705920"," So tell me how you're thinking about, about the stock here."
"7706140","7709100"," After its best year ever, following its worst year ever."
"7709100","7709920"," So now what?"
"7710300","7710420"," Right. "
"7710600","7713120"," So I mean, remember last year was you came out your efficiency."
"7713440","7714220"," We're going to cut costs."
"7714800","7717440"," And now let's just see how Insta is doing. "
"7717880","7718880"," Are the algorithms working?"
"7718880","7721880"," How much are those really giving them operating efficiency?"
"7722800","7725060"," And what is the expectation going forward?"
"7725240","7726240"," And I think that's the future."
"7726700","7730820"," Because if he's, again, it's the cash flow and Steve's talking about, you know, whether they go"
"7730820","7735520"," Vision Pro or whatever, but it all depends on that return of investment on CapEx, right?"
"7735680","7738480"," You saw Google got sold off because they said we're increasing CapEx."
"7738740","7741060"," The market today is not favorably over CapEx. "
"7741200","7741860"," They want cash flow."
"7741960","7744360"," And if you're doing CapEx, it's cash flow."
"7744740","7745700"," What, how is it going to work?"
"7745820","7745980"," Okay. "
"7745980","7747920"," So Julia Borsten out in LA."
"7748280","7749180"," What's going to matter most here?"
"7749840","7752800"," Well, Scott, we're going to hear from Meta this afternoon."
"7752800","7755580"," And the key number to watching this earnings is revenue. "
"7755580","7757460"," It's expected to grow 22%."
"7757460","7761640"," That would be down a hair from the 23% revenue growth we saw in Q3."
"7761900","7765960"," But the stock has surged about 160% in the past 12 months. "
"7766280","7769320"," And still analysts are overwhelmingly bullish."
"7769620","7775420"," 81% have a buy and 16% have a hold pointing to tailwinds, including artificial intelligence,"
"7776360","7777620"," boosting usage as well as assets."
"7777620","7782480"," No, I think the S&P 500 on my leg are currently up serious for 76% of the session. "
"7782480","7785960"," The CEO Mark Zuckerberg has any new proclamations about cost controls."
"7786180","7790080"," And if he follows up on his public apology before Congress yesterday."
"7790560","7790780"," Scott?"
"7791140","7791880"," That was a big moment. "
"7792100","7792740"," Julia, thanks."
"7792920","7793800"," See, a lot of you today as well."
"7794020","7794600"," Can't wait for that. "
"7794760","7796280"," That's Julia Borsten out in Los Angeles."
"7796480","7801720"," Then there is Amazon, up 17 and a half percent since November 1st."
"7802300","7803520"," What matters here?"
"7803520","7805020"," AWS growth. "
"7805560","7809960"," So in regards to this recent rally in the S&P 500, I rally in some of the world's largest"
"7809960","7810880"," technology companies."
"7811240","7815700"," Then stocks higher with traders are wasting earnings from a share of maker caps and Friday's job"
"7815700","7815860"," reports."
"7816680","7818400"," What I said at the Open is really the story. "
"7819040","7823920"," All this leaning out in efficiency, they pulled back the reins on trying to deliver things."
"7824640","7827040"," Like they were at one day and then it was like six hours."
"7827720","7829760"," Do you go to an hour or can people like relax?"
"7830560","7832040"," And we could have some margin of expansion. "
"7833300","7836840"," Reintroducing ads into the television product."
"7837400","7838040"," That'll be interesting."
"7838460","7839440"," We'll get some color on that. "
"7840120","7846000"," But that quarterly operating income number projected to grow 280% to $10 billion."
"7846820","7853080"," We don't really think of Amazon in terms of like this juggernaut throwing off, you know, that kind"
"7853080","7854280"," of free cash flow, etc."
"7854740","7860160"," We always have historically thought of it as a company that's really good at growing vertically and"
"7860160","7863200"," horizontally and just constantly delivering on growth. "
"7863480","7864840"," And they are doing that, by the way."
"7865040","7865820"," What up, Steve?"
"7866220","7866660"," Milly brother."
"7867500","7868540"," You're your number. "
"7869100","7871920"," It's not 20, but it's also not 2% like Apple."
"7872320","7876680"," So you're going to get the growth in the AWS business to about 24 billion."
"7876840","7877380"," That'll be important. "
"7877380","7883020"," But again, thinking about Amazon in terms of its streamlining and in terms of it becoming more"
"7883020","7886480"," profitable, I think makes it a more interesting story for this year."
"7886480","7888960"," And I agree with what Bryn had to say."
"7889540","7892700"," Like, if you ask me, like, which of these names is a better chance about performing?"
"7893220","7895540"," I think Amazon versus Apple, I own both. "
"7895920","7897220"," That's what I think is going to happen now."
"7897360","7899480"," Sir, I'm on your campus."
"7900060","7900780"," Yeah, I mean, you can't. "
"7900840","7907300"," I think Amazon's future for the next few quarters is a lot better than when you compare it to Apple"
"7907300","7908900"," because they've got the levers to pull."
"7909420","7913880"," I really like the prime example where you start now, put advertising in there."
"7914020","7915560"," That's margin that drops to the bottom line. "
"7916140","7920000"," And you start putting their efficiency in terms of logistics."
"7920700","7922880"," That's all going to start to get optimized as well."
"7923040","7927020"," So you will see that and that's what investors want, cash flow and efficiency. "
"7927520","7929820"," Two things really quickly on the ads."
"7930220","7935340"," Number one, in three years, Amazon became the third largest advertising platform in the world."
"7936080","7939680"," Like, we're not giving this company any credit for that, but that's a true statement. "
"7939960","7941160"," That's an actual fact."
"7941660","7947780"," Number two, if you listen to what Netflix had to say the other day, actually the subscribers that"
"7947780","7953040"," are on the ads here are more profitable than the subscribers paying full price on the premium tier."
"7953380","7959320"," Also, not something that I think anyone expected from Netflix or from trying for that matter as"
"7959320","7960320"," they push into this. "
"7960720","7966420"," And then the third thing, and of course, we don't know yet, but very important to point out, any"
"7966420","7972400"," news that they have to share on their AI efforts is going to get a lot of attention just because"
"7972400","7977920"," of the built-in user base that Amazon has to power with AI applications."
"7978580","7981920"," They have not been the most vocal, but anthropic is a big deal."
"7982320","7987020"," And they could talk a lot about that tonight, which I think would be additional upside. "
"7987520","7989940"," So you guys kind of alluded to this, but let's go deeper."
"7990480","7997680"," On Bryn, whether you think this is the week that these megacap stocks separate themselves from each"
"7997680","8005420"," other, that they don't trade any more as a virtual group, that we do get the, you know, divergence"
"8005420","8006600"," between some of these names."
"8006800","8012480"," Now maybe the seeds of that have been sewn with Microsoft and Alphabet, but you tell me what you"
"8012480","8012680"," think. "
"8014260","8017580"," I think directionally they can move in the same direction."
"8018000","8020760"," I think the magnitude though will be very different."
"8021240","8026340"," And so if you think about Amazon also, one thing that Sarat and Josh didn't mention is if you've"
"8026340","8032220"," ever toured an Amazon warehouse, they're incredibly sophisticated robotics, but they also have a"
"8032220","8034280"," lot of people doing very tedious tasks. "
"8035000","8040120"," And I think that Amazon, more than any of the megacaps, internally is going to continue to benefit"
"8040120","8044700"," from the productivity increase that their robotics are able to replace humans."
"8045080","8046740"," And that will go straight to the bottom line."
"8047200","8051480"," And so I think between that, between their partnership with Anthropic, I think that Amazon is"
"8051480","8054260"," actually flat over the last two years. "
"8054260","8059140"," And so we all like to talk about one year returns, but really over the last two years it's been"
"8059140","8059600"," dead money."
"8060180","8061940"," I think Andy Jassy has a sea legs."
"8062400","8068420"," So I think there's all of these little, these little metrics where Amazon, along with Microsoft can"
"8068420","8073160"," really start pulling away and have once again a much more magnitude of a return than I think an"
"8073160","8074340"," apple, which will be a laggard. "
"8074600","8074940"," Okay."
"8075180","8081720"," So let's, let's make a turn then, um, wise to the aftermath of the Powell pushed out pivot as I'm"
"8081720","8082200"," calling it."
"8082200","8083840"," I mean, basically says no cut in March. "
"8084400","8088980"," Now, you know, the market still has about 40, 42% or so looking for March."
"8089580","8092540"," Yields are down, markets having a nice snap back here."
"8093100","8096820"," I'm going to reveal Josh's new trade in just a minute, but give me your read here, post Powell. "
"8098820","8102240"," Yeah, look, I thought it was, I thought it was really overdone yesterday."
"8102740","8107280"," And I was surprised at the reaction telling truth, maybe it was compounded by New York Community"
"8107280","8107700"," Bank."
"8107720","8108300"," I don't know. "
"8108620","8114940"," But in order for the market of sold off yesterday, you have to believe that the timing of the, of"
"8114940","8120360"," the cut, being pushed the second half of the year, which is where I've lived for a long, long time,"
"8120600","8123780"," is going to really cost the economy a big time."
"8124080","8125680"," And I just don't see that being the case."
"8126100","8127240"," So I think it was overdone. "
"8127460","8132460"," I think the market would be a lot higher today, but for the mega caps reporting this afternoon."
"8133000","8135760"," So to me, Powell said the economy is strong."
"8136240","8141560"," And he says it's continuing to go, labor is still bid for, that there's still an imbalance there,"
"8141780","8145540"," that the economy just looks very good, so they can be patient. "
"8146120","8149980"," So it'd be a great buying opportunity, but for tonight."
"8150340","8151920"," And I did buy, so I'm going to get to it later."
"8152580","8160340"," But, you know, what was the biggest surprise was that you continue to see, as you pointed out, 42%"
"8160340","8161400"," calling for a March cut. "
"8161640","8162880"," What are they thinking?"
"8163380","8165140"," You know, it's not going to happen."
"8165340","8166680"," He told you it's not going to happen."
"8166800","8167900"," Well, so move on. "
"8167900","8173460"," What he says yesterday, I get it, and the market reacted, and the algos reacted, and all that."
"8173740","8174840"," But it's only January."
"8175520","8176860"," I mean, it's February, you know. "
"8177420","8178340"," That's two jobs, numbers."
"8178760","8180940"," So you see, but think of what it has to happen."
"8181240","8182360"," But think of what it has to happen. "
"8182460","8188380"," The market, the economy really has to have precipitous decline before the next Fed meeting."
"8188700","8191160"," The data's got to come in, like really, really bad."
"8191700","8195459"," And while we've seen mixed data, the trend is not that bad. "
"8195459","8196620"," That trend is cut."
"8197040","8197180"," The trend is good."
"8197180","8198480"," It's a good place to take it. "
"8198740","8199000"," Major."
"8199799","8200240"," Right."
"8200400","8201799"," But we're getting two reads on inflation. "
"8202240","8203260"," We got a couple of jobs reports."
"8203520","8204860"," We got a lot on the table."
"8205000","8207940"," And by the way, UBS, they're sticking with March. "
"8208639","8212219"," What's interesting is that Goldman had doubled down on March, not anymore."
"8212520","8214360"," They moved to May, as did Barclays."
"8214840","8218260"," And June is B of A, Deutsches City, Morgan Stanley, JPM. "
"8218459","8221980"," So they think it's even going to take until the summer to do that."
"8222260","8224639"," Now, let's get to your new move."
"8225459","8228299"," You bought a disastrous stock yesterday. "
"8229020","8230360"," New York Community Bank."
"8230719","8231799"," New York Community Bank."
"8231980","8232680"," Why did you buy this?"
"8233000","8233200"," Yeah. "
"8233559","8234059"," So I don't know."
"8234680","8236200"," It's a trade."
"8236959","8237080"," Sorry. "
"8237240","8238059"," So let me say two things."
"8238420","8239680"," I'm not calling a bottom in the stock."
"8239879","8240600"," Please don't follow me. "
"8240700","8241299"," It's where it's a trade."
"8242260","8243200"," We're not getting married."
"8243280","8243900"," I'm not getting married. "
"8244040","8245100"," We're hooking up."
"8245440","8245580"," Okay."
"8246820","8252559"," Look, if you know anything about this business, you know the Bible, the number one rule of picking"
"8252559","8256740"," stocks, you never, ever, ever invest in a company that's based on the island. "
"8257240","8262320"," You could just assume it's either an outright scam or it's people that have no idea what they're"
"8262320","8263160"," doing in aptitude."
"8263600","8265200"," And this is your home for those who don't know."
"8265340","8266320"," I'm from all I could say that. "
"8266440","8267540"," You can't say that."
"8267740","8268280"," You can't say that."
"8268280","8268760"," You definitely can't say that, Josie. "
"8268760","8269920"," That's why I referenced it with that."
"8270120","8272600"," So Long Island-based Company, biggest red flag."
"8272840","8277580"," It's like meeting somebody who says they, you know, all right, but like put that aside because it's"
"8277580","8277840"," a trade. "
"8278340","8280020"," This is what I would say on New York Community Bank."
"8280219","8281120"," I listen to the call."
"8281120","8283860"," I don't know anymore than anyone else does. "
"8284420","8288299"," All I can tell you is it sounds like they did the signature deal."
"8288580","8290020"," They got in way over their head."
"8290120","8291420"," They bit off more than they could chew. "
"8291680","8292780"," They also did Flag Star."
"8293200","8294900"," So they got involved with two acquisitions."
"8295760","8298940"," They are not accustomed to being a hundred billion dollar bank. "
"8299280","8300120"," They're not like mentally."
"8300459","8301700"," They don't know what they're doing yet."
"8302100","8304580"," And this is the quarter where basically they came out and admitted it. "
"8304840","8309280"," So it seems like this is not some systemic issue."
"8309280","8310160"," It could change."
"8310840","8312000"," JP Morgan reiterated. "
"8312500","8314500"," They still think the stock should trade to 11 bucks."
"8315200","8316719"," And they're sticking with it."
"8317020","8318059"," So I just looked at it. "
"8318139","8323920"," I said, I know nothing more than the market about this situation other than I like to buy panics."
"8324360","8327680"," Here's what's different for me versus a fund manager looking at this."
"8328240","8329260"," I could get out today. "
"8329799","8331780"," If I end up being wrong, I get out tomorrow."
"8332280","8338180"," If you are doing this with other people's money in a fund, you have to explain yourself why you"
"8338180","8340100"," were taking a shot on this to shareholders."
"8340760","8342920"," So I don't think institutions want to do that. "
"8343240","8344059"," Hence the panic."
"8344440","8346020"," The stock is down huge yesterday."
"8346719","8348059"," Another big down day today. "
"8348540","8351100"," So early this morning when the market opened, I said, you know what?"
"8351360","8354799"," I'm willing to bet there's a little bit more panic than there needs to be here."
"8355059","8359340"," And I'm willing to bet it's still down because there are people that can't admit they own it."
"8359580","8360719"," And they want to get out of it. "
"8360980","8362639"," And I like that setup."
"8362860","8363260"," So we'll see."
"8363379","8364000"," We'll see what happens. "
"8364200","8366540"," This is not an endorsement for Kio Community Bank."
"8366879","8368280"," This is just me taking a shot."
"8368280","8370219"," Where I see a lot of other people panicking. "
"8370379","8376299"," OK, so let's get then a little bit more on the kinds of opportunities that might make sense in the"
"8376299","8376799"," here and now."
"8376920","8381080"," Josh Caesar, a disaster, says, hey, I'm going to take a shot for a trade."
"8381420","8382740"," KRE, wait, wait, hold on. "
"8382940","8386059"," The whole KRE down 6% yesterday, 5% today."
"8386420","8393200"," That's the worst two-day stretch since the many banking panic, March and 9th and 10th and 13th"
"8393200","8395000"," earlier last year."
"8395280","8397640"," So this is like a pretty momentous two-day period. "
"8397640","8398740"," For all these names."
"8398920","8401680"," We're having a pretty good bounce back here from that sell-off yesterday."
"8401920","8402960"," By the way, it was the S&Ps. "
"8403240","8404260"," It was down one and a half percent."
"8404500","8406760"," It was the S&Ps worst day since the end of September."
"8407360","8412560"," That gives you an idea of the kind of market we've been in largely since the late fall, because"
"8412560","8413460"," we've rallied a lot. "
"8414120","8418000"," Gunlock told me yesterday, Jeffrey Gunlock, of course, of Double Line said risk assets are"
"8418000","8419780"," extended, including parts of credit."
"8420280","8421080"," Said he likes cash."
"8421380","8422040"," She likes treasuries. "
"8422280","8425060"," But there's the number one idea he had right now."
"8425140","8428280"," I want you to listen to what he told me because it's relevant to a move we have from our"
"8428280","8428840"," committee today."
"8428920","8429320"," Here's Gunlock. "
"8431520","8438320"," One thing I want to say for a long time recommended India as an equity asset, the Indian economy is"
"8438320","8439740"," the strongest economy in the world."
"8440260","8442140"," Their services PMI is over 60."
"8442560","8445940"," Their manufacturing PMI is basically the most robust in the world. "
"8446380","8451840"," I think that investors should be using weakness if recession materializes"
"8451840","8460100"," and starts to have a stake in it."
"8460220","8463760"," Because I don't like to recommend things that would be in my funds."
"8464100","8468700"," But I think INDA is a good investment for people looking to get equity exposure on weakness. "
"8469080","8472080"," It's my number one recommendation for 2024."
"8472940","8474820"," So that was interesting to hear, Weiss."
"8475240","8478140"," He says he doesn't have a stake in it, but you do now. "
"8478540","8479740"," You bought the INDA."
"8480180","8480340"," Yeah."
"8483180","8486700"," Well, the INDA, I owned by also two smaller ones. "
"8487160","8489500"," I've bought them before Jeff came on with that."
"8489720","8491560"," And I've been thinking about it for a while."
"8491980","8496260"," As Apple transitions their supply chain to India, they're not going to be alone. "
"8496840","8499120"," China is just, it's antagonistic."
"8499520","8500480"," It's a foreign company."
"8501020","8506120"," So why would you want to be there with an unstable government that is communist?"
"8506960","8507660"," So where do you go?"
"8507960","8509660"," And by the way, labor's not as cheap as it was. "
"8510080","8510780"," So where do you go?"
"8510920","8513240"," You go to India because they've got the population there."
"8513760","8514540"," They've got cheap labor."
"8514900","8516320"," They know how to do things. "
"8516660","8518280"," It's a well-educated populace."
"8519020","8519900"," And they're welcoming."
"8520340","8521460"," They're learning you there. "
"8521820","8523400"," So that's why I bought India."
"8523800","8525540"," Now, unfortunately, it's added ties."
"8526000","8527100"," So I bought it added ties. "
"8527340","8533100"," But the other reason I like it, which Jeff didn't mention, is that as rates come down, emerging"
"8533100","8537680"," markets do better because you're fixed rate."
"8537960","8542080"," You're yielding instruments there."
"8542540","8543420"," The yields come down. "
"8543420","8546580"," So pays for you to go more into risk assets, equities."
"8546960","8550260"," So to me, it's perfectly aligned for a continued move higher."
"8550620","8551200"," So that's why I do. "
"8551280","8558920"," So I also, in the SMIN, I own the INDY, but primarily the INDA that Jeffrey mentions, because"
"8558920","8561460"," that's the only one that really has institutional value."
"8562060","8563800"," Even though the others will outperform."
"8564020","8567820"," OK, I appreciate you explaining all that for us and certainly our viewers. "
"8568080","8569680"," You've been talking a lot about international markets."
"8569980","8571420"," Yeah, Weiss is going to make some money here."
"8571420","8573480"," The trend here is phenomenal. "
"8574300","8575600"," And Japan looks great, too."
"8575680","8578680"," Like, there are countries that are doing their own thing."
"8579020","8584100"," And in the Israeli- interesting, I'm curious why he didn't buy EPI, which would be my pick. "
"8584300","8584920"," I'm not in it currently."
"8585660","8590700"," But the wisdom tree earnings version of an index ETF in India."
"8591420","8595540"," But I think they'll probably all directionally be pretty much the same part. "
"8595640","8596760"," So let's take a quick break."
"8597140","8602760"," We do have the S&P 500 trying to take back 4900, not that far away from doing just that."
"8602960","8604300"," And up next, we'll do our falles of the day. "
"8604660","8607700"," Jeffrey's today has laid out its top picks for the whole year."
"8608180","8610240"," If you give you the list, we're going to debate the names."
"8610440","8614840"," And then later, we've got some hidden AI opportunities according to one key analyst. "
"8615100","8617480"," He's recommending three under the radar AI plays."
"8617760","8618520"," Could have some serious upside."
"8618980","8621780"," He thinks we're back on the half in just two minutes. "
"8624580","8627140"," Are you following the Halftime Report podcast?"
"8627680","8628780"," What are you waiting for?"
"8629280","8631320"," Look for us in your favorite podcasting app."
"8631780","8633540"," Follow the Halftime podcast now."
"8784900","8788960"," I will back our calls of the day. "
"8789040","8791820"," We're going to start with Jeffrey's today because they lay out some top US picks."
"8792020","8794480"," They claim our quote hidden in plain sight."
"8795060","8800440"," Amgen, Boeing, Caterpillar, Ulta, Martin Marietta, McDonald's, and Mondalees. "
"8800760","8803200"," You happen to own Martin Marietta."
"8803340","8804580"," I do touch on that one first."
"8804840","8806200"," Yeah, I own that in Vulcan as well. "
"8806200","8808320"," I like the whole Viscum Jira's commodity place."
"8808500","8809080"," They have pricing."
"8809480","8811440"," The demand for construction keeps on going up. "
"8811440","8812620"," We're going to do more infrastructure."
"8813100","8814940"," Stock has done well, and it continues to do well."
"8815600","8816880"," You like any names on this list?"
"8817940","8819360"," What's the blue chip names on this list?"
"8820320","8822040"," They still say are hidden in plain sight. "
"8822340","8823800"," Now, they've had some issues."
"8824640","8829720"," All of these stocks haven't done quite well this year except for Amgen's out of the gates pretty"
"8829720","8830280"," well this year."
"8830580","8831700"," Yeah, I don't know. "
"8831780","8832700"," They don't seem hidden to me."
"8834120","8839620"," I've never liked the idea of buying a stock where you basically have to bet on the global economy,"
"8840080","8845600"," especially after as much central bank tightening and quantitative tightening and all that's gone"
"8845600","8845880"," on."
"8846280","8850180"," So a lot of those names qualify for that kind of ideas. "
"8850480","8852060"," It's not a great list for me."
"8852500","8853240"," McDonald's is interesting."
"8854360","8859860"," It'll be interesting to see if they can get traction in that new day part, the snack day part with"
"8859860","8863360"," cosmetics, but that's not going to move the needle probably for 10 years. "
"8863660","8867800"," So I don't know what there is to really get excited about in the way of a catalyst for NCD."
"8868140","8872520"," We don't know McDonald's, but I think McDonald's could be interesting, especially if the economy"
"8872520","8873700"," kind of starts slowing down."
"8873840","8876180"," It's a good defensive play that has good operating margins. "
"8876660","8881060"," Do you think it could still be defensive though, given the price hikes on the menu?"
"8881400","8887360"," Well, I think the movement from going out to eat will then move more to what's cheaper compared to"
"8887360","8888580"," relatively to restaurants, right?"
"8888680","8892520"," It does, I think also, and I think we were talking about, I think we were talking about this with"
"8892520","8898760"," Stephanie Link yesterday, it does trade at an above market multiple, a premium to- To the market,"
"8899100","8901620"," right, so that's the argument as to whether it does or it doesn't."
"8903120","8905080"," It's tough arguments to make that it doesn't."
"8905460","8909840"," Over the last 10 years, it's best in class, pretty much everything they do all over the world. "
"8910620","8917160"," There are not many QSRs that even can be spoken of in the same sense as McDonald's."
"8917160","8918940"," And you're looking for consistency of earnings, right?"
"8919100","8920160"," That's the whole Apple argument."
"8920160","8923160"," Companies that can provide that, get a premium multiple in the market. "
"8923360","8927700"," Hey, Brynn, if you had to buy one of these names, forget the fact that you don't own any of"
"8927700","8929560"," them, but if you had to buy one, which one would it be?"
"8929680","8930320"," Have you thought about that?"
"8931380","8936700"," Yeah, yeah, well, actually, you know, on their list, also was Dexacom, you know, it's DXCM."
"8937420","8940860"," And that was actually on like Goldman's gross list, and I keep looking at it."
"8941400","8944740"," I don't know, so Dexacom does the glucose monitors, right?"
"8944860","8948020"," So if you have diabetes or you just wanna track your glucose levels. "
"8948560","8955600"," So what I'm tossing around is, does all of the Eli Lilly's and all of us like getting healthy with"
"8955600","8957540"," the GLP ones reduce that?"
"8957740","8958880"," Or is that just like an over shadow?"
"8959340","8961000"," But I think it's a really interesting name."
"8961720","8963400"," It's been a great, it's got a really good story."
"8963620","8966360"," So that's actually one I'm still looking at right now. "
"8966460","8968640"," Okay, that stocks at the highs of the day as well."
"8968860","8970240"," Weiss, I'll give you the same question."
"8970980","8975280"," I think I've owned some of these maybe in the past, but which one jumps out to you that looks"
"8975760","8977580"," like you take another shot at, perhaps?"
"8979660","8981680"," Yeah, ASML, it's a quality company. "
"8982240","8987960"," They took a little hit with some of their product in China, but overall, it's just steady."
"8988460","8990820"," They've got somewhat of a unique product line as well."
"8991360","8993480"," So that's one that I would buy even though it's done well. "
"8994380","8999100"," Dexacom, I've looked at it, but there are so many glucose monitoring devices out there and so many"
"8999100","9000000"," more coming out."
"9000400","9004300"," I mean, every day I get from a private company looking for funding for one of these."
"9004300","9005420"," So I wouldn't do that. "
"9005740","9009480"," And Alibaba, I just don't think Chinese any better are going to get any better."
"9009900","9010980"," So I have no interest in that."
"9011300","9012860"," And the others I just haven't really looked at. "
"9013060","9015260"," Okay, let's get the headlines now with Sylvana Hana."
"9015400","9015860"," Hi, Sylvana."
"9016020","9017160"," Hey Scott, good afternoon. "
"9017620","9018820"," Secretary of State Anthony Lincoln."
"9019440","9021060"," We'll head back to the Middle East this weekend."
"9021620","9024520"," It is his fifth trip since the Israel-Hamas War began. "
"9025120","9030080"," The White House says Lincoln will discuss post-war governance of Gaza, a ramp up of humanitarian"
"9030080","9032540"," aid, and release of the hostages."
"9033320","9039860"," European Union leaders today unanimously approved 50 billion euros in aid to Ukraine after weeks of"
"9039860","9042880"," resistance from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban."
"9043220","9048600"," With this aid package in place, the leaders are now discussing continued military aid, which"
"9048600","9051780"," diplomats say is less certain of passing. "
"9052500","9058020"," And Universal Music Group has started to remove the song catalogs of artists it represents from"
"9058020","9065120"," TikTok, including Taylor Swift and Olivia Rodrigo after talks to renew a licensing agreement broke"
"9065120","9065880"," down this week."
"9066340","9072140"," The company has accused TikTok of trying to bully it into a bad deal, while TikTok says the label"
"9072140","9074520"," is putting its own interests above its artists."
"9075260","9080700"," Now, all Universal-owned music featured in TikTok videos will be muted, and users will have to"
"9080700","9084200"," replace the remove tracks with alternative options, Scott. "
"9084660","9085780"," All right, Sylvana, thank you."
"9086000","9088840"," Sylvana Hana, up next, we are tracking more earnings movers today."
"9089080","9092160"," We're gonna give you the trades on Qualcomm and Honeywell and Merck, and more. "
"9092460","9092820"," We'll do it next."
"9261100","9261460"," NBC."
"9263420","9265460"," All right, let's talk some of these earnings movers. "
"9265600","9266840"," Sarat, what's the problem with Qualcomm?"
"9267160","9268520"," The lower than expected guide?"
"9268720","9272540"," It did get downgraded today, too, over at City to neutral you own the stock."
"9272720","9273560"," We could take a look at the chart."
"9274000","9277760"," Yeah, lower than expected guide, I think people were expecting more of the stock, bottomed at 105"
"9277760","9280180"," in November, ran up all the way to 150. "
"9280820","9284540"," So I think this was some of the profit-taking and saying, hey, we wanted higher expected earnings."
"9285060","9289820"," Well, the thing with Qualcomm is they seem to always surprise me upside, but I think they didn't"
"9289820","9291000"," just give enough guidance for it."
"9291100","9291980"," Okay, what about Honeywell?"
"9292560","9295320"," Because those revenues came in lower than expected. "
"9296340","9299120"," Revenue came in lower, the stock trades at about 24 times earnings."
"9299860","9303880"," Last four quarters, every time they announced their earnings, the stock goes down a couple of"
"9303880","9305580"," percent, so it's kind of par for them."
"9306000","9307120"," But I think it's a solid company. "
"9307420","9310440"," This is the G of the past, new CEO in place."
"9311400","9313180"," They're phenomenally in terms of execution."
"9313620","9315680"," I like this company, you buy this one on a deck. "
"9315880","9316720"," What about Merck?"
"9317520","9319500"," Earnings beat, revenue and earnings to past consensus."
"9320600","9321900"," There was strong demand for Keytruda."
"9322400","9323240"," What do we think here?"
"9323360","9324460"," The stock is up three and a half percent. "
"9324560","9326100"," You own this one too, so you're all over these names today."
"9326340","9330020"," I know, and this one's a good one, because if you look at the whole farmer sector and you get"
"9330020","9334340"," the bristles, the companies that can execute and have the earnings are going to do well, because"
"9334340","9336360"," you've got so many of them whose pipelines are dry."
"9336940","9340160"," So I think Merck's one of this one that's filling up its pipeline and will do well for the next"
"9340160","9340580"," couple of years. "
"9340580","9346460"," Okay, on deck we have Abbe is reporting and bring you on this, and that's tomorrow."
"9347080","9351120"," According to Al Jazeera, Qatar says Israel agrees to the C-5 proposal."
"9351120","9352220"," And the company is on their pipeline. "
"9352920","9357860"," In November, they bought Abbe bought immunogen, and then in December, they bought cerebell."
"9358120","9361680"," So they spent almost 20 billion in the last two months of the year."
"9362040","9366780"," This is going to be a really important call to see how they're digesting those, what synergies and"
"9366780","9370260"," what new verticals they can add to their immunotherapy and their neuroscience. "
"9371100","9373760"," Okay, Chevron and Bristol are also on deck for tomorrow."
"9373920","9375080"," You own both of these."
"9375320","9379840"," I do, and Chevron has been an underperformer for a year along with all the energy stocks. "
"9380260","9385180"," So it's going to be again, cap of discipline and what do they think where oil's going to be and"
"9385180","9387220"," how they're going to produce cashflow."
"9387520","9388500"," It's all about return of shelter."
"9388760","9391380"," So I see maybe a dividend hike and more buyback shares. "
"9392100","9395920"," All right, coming up, we're going to tell you AI opportunities beyond the biggest names."
"9396820","9401060"," One top analyst is going to be here at post nine to lay out the three under the radar AI"
"9401060","9401460"," plays."
"9401600","9402540"," He thinks you should bet on. "
"9402680","9403700"," We're coming right back after this."
"9442160","9450140"," According to a survey, OPEC crude output fell by 490,000 barrels per day in January to 26,000,000 "
"9450140","9451380",",000 barrels per day."
"9590070","9602710"," Welcome back"
"9602710","9607970"," from a Zuho today, initiating coverage on the IT services sector, calling it the picks and shovels"
"9607970","9608270"," of AI. "
"9609010","9613150"," Analysts Dan Dole of recommending three stocks to buy in that space joins us now at post nine."
"9613150","9613850"," It's good to have you here."
"9614370","9617510"," These are names beyond the bright lights, so to speak. "
"9618090","9622350"," Names like Accenture, EPAM systems and Blobint."
"9622710","9623110"," Is that how you."
"9623170","9623350"," Blobint. "
"9623550","9623930"," Yeah, Blobint."
"9624730","9625930"," You have buys on all."
"9626450","9627250"," Why are you looking here?"
"9627750","9631030"," So yeah, I want to give credit to my partner, Sean Kennedy on this one too. "
"9631130","9636250"," So we put a 100 page report on it and I think that what people don't appreciate is everyone's like"
"9636250","9639210"," talking about the AI hype, but someone needs to do the work."
"9639720","9643670"," And Bank of Canada's senior deputy governor, Roger, says central bank balance."
"9643870","9647930"," These show a total loss of about six billion, Canadian dollars. "
"9648070","9650830"," Go to someone who's going to implement Microsoft, implement ASAP."
"9651450","9653250"," Those guys are the picks and shovels."
"9653350","9655830"," They're in the engine room of the boat. "
"9656470","9658910"," You wrote about this in your latest newsletter, right?"
"9658970","9664050"," Yeah, I wanted to ask you, I think one of the most positive features of these types of companies is"
"9664050","9666650"," how capex light they are."
"9666650","9671750"," So they have thousands of employees and their technical employees, but they're not building data"
"9671750","9673210"," centers to meet this opportunity."
"9673890","9678990"," So when there's a big wave of spending on AI, a lot of the money drops right to the bottom"
"9678990","9680250"," line, they become very profitable. "
"9680750","9684630"," You speak more on how that works and what we could expect here with these three names in"
"9684630","9685170"," particular?"
"9685350","9686030"," Yeah, it's a good point."
"9686210","9690310"," And those are people heavy businesses and I think that's why, you know, there has been so much"
"9690310","9690750"," controversy."
"9691270","9693910"," AI is going to take them, you know, it's going to take them out of business, et cetera. "
"9693950","9694950"," Well, we see this differently."
"9695430","9700890"," Those, you know, people heavy businesses, when demand picks up, they can very quickly like increase"
"9700890","9703230"," or decrease, you know, the amount of workers they have."
"9703650","9707590"," And this is what gives them sort of that, you know, sort of the edge there in terms of like"
"9707590","9708690"," the ability to work on AI. "
"9708830","9709910"," So that's how we see this happening."
"9710370","9715370"," They're much better at protecting margins than someone whose capex heavy and has to build all this"
"9715370","9715590"," stuff."
"9715750","9721770"," Are these stories, do you make the case that these stories are largely unknown related to AI?"
"9722130","9724810"," Because over the last few months, these stocks have rallied a lot. "
"9725130","9730270"," So somebody must know something about the role that these companies are going to play in the"
"9730270","9732170"," building out of AI."
"9732410","9735770"," Yeah, I think it's sort of, because if you go back to last year to the AI hype and the"
"9735770","9740030"," video and stuff, the big bear debate on these names was that, you know, they're going to get"
"9740030","9740950"," disrupted by AI."
"9741110","9744050"," And then people are starting to wake up to this and are looking, let me give you an example. "
"9744870","9746510"," 10 years ago, people worried about the cloud."
"9747270","9753130"," Accenture's cloud business went from 1 billion in 2012 to 32 billion, you know, last year."
"9753310","9755370"," So these guys, this is like the best example. "
"9755550","9760750"," The correlation between software and AI is like, the R squared is like, or software in IT services"
"9760750","9761830"," is 68%."
"9761830","9764330"," So I think that's what people are waking up to."
"9764450","9768750"," And that's why these stocks have started doing better in the letter part of last year and early"
"9768750","9769170"," this year. "
"9769290","9772190"," Is the demand coming from large corporations government?"
"9772590","9773790"," Where is it coming first?"
"9774070","9775270"," And then where do you see it going to?"
"9775750","9779390"," So it's the beauty of it, it's across the board, right?"
"9779590","9783270"," You've got anywhere from Pepsi, like Disney, is Globon's largest customer."
"9783710","9784950"," So hey, you know, we did some analysis."
"9785390","9787790"," X Disney, they would have done even better because Disney had some issues. "
"9788150","9789690"," So it's literally across the board."
"9789830","9792030"," It's like an ETF on AI."
"9792510","9793630"," Like that's the way to think about it. "
"9794050","9799310"," You actually own Accenture, which is a buy from Dan with a price target of $426."
"9800530","9804390"," Yeah, look, I agree with you on our, we've owned Accenture for a long time."
"9804390","9810310"," And the idea was you get the huge operating leverage because when they get the demand come in, it's"
"9810310","9810930"," variable costs. "
"9811390","9811570"," Exactly."
"9812150","9816270"," And then they can pass that cost on and then once they're in there, they're in there for a long"
"9816270","9818610"," time and globally Accenture's everywhere."
"9818910","9822690"," So we liked that when you said it was cloud and then they do the BPO as well. "
"9822910","9827230"," So you have that offset of a company that is really asset-like."
"9827370","9830210"," I wanted to ask you about one other aspect of this."
"9830210","9837010"," People trading AI, they've been forced into megacap stocks in videos of trillion dollars, alphabet,"
"9837570","9837570"," meta. "
"9837970","9839170"," These are gigantic stocks."
"9840050","9845390"," Managers, like people that have a style bonds they have to conform to, they want to be in AI."
"9845390","9850670"," Bank of Canada's, I still expect court of growth to be fairly weak despite positive November"
"9850670","9851230"," figures. "
"9851650","9856550"," So there's not a lot of competition for capital amongst, let's say, mid-cap managers look at a"
"9856550","9859250"," global, what is it, $11 billion in market caps?"
"9859250","9865090"," So this is like in the wheelhouse of managers that have been watching this AI trade go crazy and"
"9865090","9865850"," they've been on the sidelines."
"9866350","9869530"," Do you think that'll be a big catalyst for why these stocks will work this year?"
"9869690","9870470"," Yeah, I would agree with that."
"9870570","9872670"," I think it's sort of waking up to that next wave. "
"9872810","9875830"," I think what you're describing, Josh, is sort of the next wave of AI."
"9876030","9878910"," Okay, I can't, you know, I'm too late on these names."
"9879170","9879770"," What's your idea?"
"9879930","9880550"," I missed I do. "
"9880810","9881050"," Exactly."
"9881390","9886170"," And by the way, you don't have to take, you know, companies specific risk for gain, brands and"
"9886170","9888050"," WTI's, $1 a barrel."
"9888050","9890470"," The ETF thing, you don't have to take company specific risk. "
"9890790","9895290"," They'll implement NVIDIA, they'll implement Microsoft, they'll implement, you know, anything that's"
"9895290","9900990"," AI and that's kind of the lower risk to getting exposure to AI and that's kind of the crux of"
"9900990","9901350"," our work."
"9902310","9904950"," Why, so you have it under the radar name that you have your eye on too, right?"
"9906570","9908550"," Well, I've actually owned it for a while."
"9908750","9909810"," It's a bird of VRT. "
"9910450","9918190"," So the new data centers and you need new data centers for AI that the RACS, which Vertev makes the"
"9918190","9920890"," RACS and they make more importantly the cooling system."
"9921330","9927990"," So the RACS run a lot hotter because they'll use 60 kilowatts of power, you know, per RAC versus"
"9927990","9930770"," five to 10 for traditional data centers."
"9931170","9933790"," There are also three stories tall the data centers. "
"9934130","9938950"," So I was looking for a picks and shuffle way to play data centers, data centers cap rates of 3%."
"9938950","9941510"," That's great for sovereign, some institutions have been off me."
"9941690","9946010"," So Vertev is a $20 billion mark cat the chart looks phenomenal, Josh. "
"9946390","9946990"," Look at it."
"9947130","9950890"," And I think it's actually a pretty good takeout candidate but the future for them is extremely"
"9950890","9951390"," bright."
"9951690","9956110"," It's not compellingly cheap but I think the scarcity value is very meaningful there. "
"9956210","9960590"," So I've owned that for about a month and a half or so and look, they'll report mid month."
"9961870","9963810"," Maybe, you know, they're over the skis a little bit."
"9964010","9965510"," I doubt it, but the stock comes in. "
"9965650","9966490"," I definitely buy more."
"9966790","9967690"," Okay, good stuff."
"9968030","9968850"," Everybody, Dan, thanks. "
"9969290","9970210"," Nice to meet you."
"9970210","9970510"," Nice to meet you."
"9970510","9970690"," Thank you. "
"9970730","9974270"," I appreciate it."
"9974270","9975890"," Time low, we're going to break down the move there."
"9976130","9978690"," Plus show you more of today's winners and losers. "
"9979470","9981630"," First of all, Mike Santoli, he joins us next with his mid-day word."
"10005670","10007310"," ExxonMobil also turns negative."
"10132710","10136070"," US stocks extend gains and as they're up 1%. "
"10165940","10169000"," Yeah, you're back."
"10169200","10173060"," The ticket market's down the chair of Mike Santoli is here at the desk for his mid-day word."
"10173380","10174440"," Got a nice little move in the market. "
"10174620","10178420"," I snapped back from yesterday's Powell-induced sell-off, I suppose."
"10178640","10179400"," Yes, for sure."
"10179700","10180040"," Thank you. "
"10180140","10182360"," We talked about the last, you know, near the close."
"10182660","10187360"," Often a little bit of a rethink, but I have to say it's not the cleanest story line all around,"
"10187560","10191680"," so you have the bond market saying, okay, maybe we have to wait longer for the Fed to ease."
"10191840","10193680"," We'll ease on our own through the long end. "
"10193860","10195680"," We're buying the heck out of the 10-year treasury yield."
"10196020","10197620"," That brings it below 4%."
"10197620","10199740"," The rest of the market can kind of live with that. "
"10200200","10206360"," On the same day, first cut it, you know, first quarter GDP from Atlanta is 4.2 or something nutty"
"10206360","10206840"," like that."
"10207120","10209540"," ISM is better than expected, but labor's a little bit soft."
"10209720","10211780"," So very dissonant, but macro backdrop. "
"10212980","10216720"," You know, I said coming into the week, I think quality is kind of expensive."
"10217860","10220160"," The cheap cyclical seem hard to trust."
"10220980","10226060"," You net it all together and it feels like, you know, that the market probably needs a little bit of"
"10226060","10231800"," a reset or a rest, but it's coming in this benign way so far, which is kind of chopping around,"
"10231940","10233200"," churning, rotating sideways. "
"10233820","10237260"," It is February, you might have to expect a little bit of more turbulence."
"10237800","10243300"," I am glad and encouraged to see that the regional banks may be trying to find their footing."
"10243740","10249460"," Two days after NYCB, we can't really figure out why exactly that should be applicable to so many"
"10249460","10249980"," other banks. "
"10250280","10254480"," So all that, you know, boil together leaves us, you know, where we are."
"10254480","10260140"," We've taken another little move higher here in the market and we're just showing you WTI, which is"
"10260140","10266820"," taking a noticeable move lower as you see on, there are some reports of progress towards some type"
"10266820","10268380"," of ceasefire out in the Middle East."
"10268560","10272740"," So we're going to keep watching those headlines, but it appears that the market is at least moving"
"10272740","10273940"," on those initial reports. "
"10274240","10276820"," Dows better than 300 points to the upside now."
"10277180","10282260"," S&P, we said, is trying to get back above 4900 after yesterday's one and a half percent dip."
"10282560","10285700"," And that's a sizable cliff that crude oil has. "
"10285860","10287240"," Yeah, right around that all came together."
"10287360","10289000"," Yeah, so we'll continue to watch all that."
"10289120","10289420"," Thanks, Mike. "
"10289540","10291200"," I'll see you on closing bell as well."
"10291760","10293040"," Up next, two winners, two losers."
"10293280","10293580"," We'll trade them. "
"10449010","10449810"," We're back."
"10450010","10452250"," Just want to alert you to two big winners, two big losers."
"10452910","10456930"," We mentioned pelotons down 23% the lowest level ever for that stock. "
"10457210","10459390"," C.H. Robinson, they missed on their earnings."
"10459630","10460530"," That stock getting hammered."
"10460910","10462590"," Cortiva's higher as they beat. "
"10462790","10465090"," And then Etsy, Brynn, what do you think of Etsy here?"
"10465550","10468370"," With this news of Elliot in that name."
"10470270","10472250"," Yeah, well, they obviously have a playbook here."
"10472470","10474250"," Remember, they took a big stake in Pinterest. "
"10474930","10478550"," I think they're helped Pinterest monetize and advertise more."
"10478710","10480530"," And I think Etsy has a lot of room to run."
"10480930","10485770"," And so I think if they can do that same type of playbook, the market definitely loves it up 9%. "
"10485770","10487910"," So it looks like it looks like a winner today."
"10490530","10497010"," The bells interrupting you here right behind us at the post here because Amerisports is officially"
"10497010","10497670"," open now."
"10497670","10499490"," For trading that IPO. "
"10499810","10503810"," Of course, they're the owner of Wilson, the tennis gear, Solomon ski boots, Louisville slugger,"
"10504310","10506570"," Basset got stuff all over around the floor here."
"10506750","10507450"," We take a look again."
"10507850","10511170"," This was expected to be maybe price 16 to 18. "
"10511550","10513470"," Drop below that, priced at 13."
"10513970","10515930"," And you see the stock is a little bit north of that."
"10516070","10516890"," It's a modest gain. "
"10517810","10521690"," Maybe not the kind of pop that they were looking for, but we'll continue to track that as we get"
"10521690","10523790"," another IPO here on the floor."
"10523850","10525670"," Yeah, they should have called it Amerisports AI."
"10526310","10527290"," That's what I would have done. "
"10528530","10529190"," Just saying."
"10530590","10532290"," So we're going to take a break."
"10532830","10536150"," We're going to say we'll keep watching that. "
"10537330","10538970"," Again, so you got another IPO."
"10539230","10542910"," It's been really slow, Steve, you know, in terms of the IPOs that are coming to market."
"10543730","10544410"," A slow drip. "
"10544850","10546490"," Do we think that this is going to improve?"
"10546930","10550610"," It's one of the reasons why some have been buying stocks like Goldman Sachs, for example, thinking"
"10550610","10552090"," that capital markets are going to improve."
"10552750","10553110"," What do you think?"
"10555950","10557030"," It's a timing issue."
"10557310","10560750"," And I think it's still a second half event for the market to open up. "
"10560930","10564690"," The more stability and Amerisource, you got to see our trades, but it's not going to do."
"10564890","10570130"," We had two others arm, which has done okay, but basically it's second half event, pure and simple."
"10570510","10573810"," I wouldn't get excited about it, but still a good reason to buy Goldman in advance of it. "
"10573890","10574370"," You can't wait."
"10575370","10575730"," Okay."
"10576350","10577190"," What about you, Sarat?"
"10577830","10582570"," Look, I think indications like this, if you get more IPOs, you get more capital markets activity. "
"10582910","10583930"," Rates are coming down."
"10584370","10588170"," I think that's a good reason also to buy the Goldman's and Morgan's studies of the world, because"
"10588170","10591870"," now you can actually say, what's my capital cost going to be as opposed to our rates are going to"
"10591870","10592510"," keep on going up."
"10592690","10593390"," And spreads are tight. "
"10593830","10596530"," So if you're going to go out and raise debt, this is the time to do it."
"10596650","10602650"," I mean, look, it's priced lower than it was expected, right, from what the earlier range was."
"10602850","10604650"," And it's a 3% mover. "
"10604910","10607650"," Does this give you any degree of confidence?"
"10607650","10612090"," I mean, is this the kind of pop you want to see to give you a real sign that, hey,"
"10612150","10614350"," the markets are purely open for business now again."
"10614850","10619410"," I think this is okay if you kind of have to go out in public, but you want to see"
"10619410","10620010"," a higher pop."
"10620230","10620990"," You want to see activity. "
"10621210","10625850"," You want to see investors coming in and saying, I want to own some of these new stocks coming in."
"10626090","10626930"," Let's do some final trades."
"10627190","10627950"," What do you got for us?"
"10628070","10633170"," I was just going to say, we're not done with tech earnings far from it, even though the big guys"
"10633170","10633650"," are this week. "
"10634130","10635690"," I have PayPal next week."
"10635690","10637570"," I have Snap and I have Uber."
"10638230","10640510"," And they're not all that important to me. "
"10640690","10641590"," Uber certainly is."
"10642050","10644010"," But these are some names that I'm watching for."
"10644390","10645490"," And let's not forget. "
"10645970","10647210"," There's way more to come."
"10647590","10648850"," So, Brandon, what's your final?"
"10651010","10651490"," Diamondback."
"10651850","10656050"," Energy had a tough year last year, but Diamondback was a bright spot up around 13%. "
"10656050","10656690"," Best EMP."
"10657590","10660710"," I think they're going to continue to have increased dividends, catbacks, and buybacks."
"10661230","10663570"," Yeah, we were watching, obviously, the move in crude oil. "
"10663570","10670670"," We just showed you dropping pretty hard on those reports that perhaps we're closer to some level or"
"10670670","10672970"," some degree of ceasefire in the Middle East."
"10673110","10674610"," So, we're going to continue to watch that."
"10674730","10675490"," Weiss, what's your final?"
"10677210","10678250"," Taiwan, send me. "
"10678350","10680150"," Talk about picks and shovels for AI."
"10680930","10684630"," It's a third devaluation of AMD."
"10685630","10686950"," And guess who makes the chips?"
"10687530","10688530"," So, you got to own this one. "
"10688830","10689050"," Gotcha."
"10689290","10689350"," That's right."
"10689350","10691210"," We talked about it before. "
"10691410","10694790"," I want to see how they're going to execute and what they're saying for the next quarter."
"10694850","10697270"," Pick that as your final trade on the day it's reported earnings."
"10697610","10698190"," Are you new here?"
"10698590","10699310"," We don't do this. "
"10699490","10699970"," The gutty move."
"10700570","10701670"," I'm speaking up."
"10701790","10702590"," I'm speaking up. "
"10703310","10705510"," Closing Bell, we're going to run you right up to this big night."
"10705910","10712290"," Malcolm Etheridge, Stephanie Link, Joe Terranova, Mark Mahaney, Lauren Goodwin will be all over it."
"10712490","10717230"," We'll certainly track what's happening in the markets, too, as we continue to recover from those"
"10717230","10718110"," post-pow losses. "
"10718110","10719290"," I'll see you on Closing Bell."
"10724010","10724690"," Hi, everybody."
"10724970","10726930"," I'm Brian Sullivan in for Kelly Evans today. "
"10727190","10728170"," And here's what's ahead."
"10728590","10732790"," Timeline, Turmoil, following FIDTRJ Palace pushback on a march cut."
"10733350","10735850"," The forecast revisions are coming in, including from Goldman Sachs. "
"10736410","10741250"," They're chief U.S. Economists here with the Y and the what of what the timeline looks like now."
"10741490","10744650"," Plus, cutout 4 from the MAG 7."
"10744650","10749710"," Your guest says the terrific three is the new play and he'll name the three names."
"10749830","10750250"," He loves. "
"10750710","10756730"," And the earnings barrage rolls on and why now is a good time to get in on three out of"
"10756730","10759030"," the four stocks who are ready to report."
"10759630","10761030"," We'll name those names as well."
"10761650","10762950"," All that ahead across the hour. "
"10763110","10766930"," What we begin with today's markets and Mr. Dominic Chu with the number."
"10767190","10767810"," Tom, how we look?"
"10768170","10768330"," All right."
"10768470","10772630"," So Mr. Brian Sullivan, it's generally a green day and we are seeing a bounce back from the losses"
"10772630","10774370"," that we saw post FID yesterday. "
"10774370","10779130"," If you take a look at the down industrials up about three quarters of one percent, 275 points, 38 "
"10779130","10779850",",424."
"10780050","10788230"," The NASDAQ composite up one percent, 15,300, 146 points of the S&P 500, 48,88 right now."
"10788710","10793570"," It's up 42 points north of three quarters of one percent and we're tilting towards the highs of the"
"10793570","10793810"," session. "
"10794310","10799590"," We were up roughly 51 points in the S&P at the highs up about eight points at the lows."
"10799990","10801310"," So again, generally a positive day."
"10801430","10803170"," We'll see if that bounce back momentum can continue. "
"10803170","10809910"," One other place we're keeping a close on that has downside momentum and to a lot a huge degree is"
"10809910","10815650"," in the regional banking sector, specifically in smaller and medium sized banks doing part of that"
"10815650","10821610"," New York commercial bank NYCB massive drop yesterday tied to that surprise loss of slashing their"
"10821610","10822400"," dividend by 70%."
"10823090","10825410"," It lost 38% of its value yesterday."
"10826030","10827690"," It's lost another 4% right now. "
"10827790","10829530"," That's well off session lows at this point."
"10829570","10833930"," So there's a bit of dip buying, if you will, whether it's fundamentally driven or maybe just short"
"10833930","10834690"," covering, who knows?"
"10834950","10836330"," But a mix of the two there."
"10836650","10839870"," It's lost roughly 38 to 40% of its value in two days. "
"10840230","10844830"," Western Alliance though, Valley National, Webster Financial, Zion's Bank Corp amongst some of those"
"10844830","10849470"," bigger well known regional bank names that are moving down in sympathy, some concerns about"
"10849470","10854010"," commercial real estate, net interest margins permeating through the industry, keep an eye on"
"10854010","10854570"," regional banks."
"10855030","10859750"," And then you mentioned that terrific three, magnificent seven, terrific, whatever it is right now"
"10859750","10860230"," at this point."
"10860230","10864110"," Well, Apple, Amazon and Meta platforms, of course, are going to be in focus. "
"10864290","10868070"," They're all up today after losing some steam yesterday, all through report earnings."
"10868610","10871390"," And I'm just going to give you this tidbit, Brian, because I know you like the random but"
"10871390","10872910"," interesting stats and everything else."
"10873390","10878950"," Apple right now, the options market is pricing in a plus or minus three and a half percent move. "
"10879430","10885550"," For Amazon and Meta platforms both for these, you're parking plus or minus six percent."
"10885870","10889670"," So the options market is showing you a little bit of what traders are expecting right now."
"10890090","10891390"," Of course, we don't know if it's up or down. "
"10891430","10892670"," Still keep an eye on those trades."
"10892730","10893850"," I'll send things back over to you."
"10894070","10894590"," Good like it. "
"10894630","10895790"," You called it a green day."
"10896010","10897770"," So I guess you're taking the long view."
"10898070","10899490"," I see what you did. "
"10899530","10900430"," See what I did there."
"10900430","10901550"," All right, Dominic Chu."
"10901730","10902350"," Thank you very much. "
"10902710","10902930"," All right."
"10902950","10905710"," So why don't we start then our coverage with the Federal Reserve?"
"10906370","10911650"," Goldman Sachs adjusting its rates forecast after Fed Chair Powell said a March move is unlikely."
"10912130","10913170"," Basically said it's not happening. "
"10913590","10919750"," Goldman now pushing back the first cut estimate from March to May, although the bank says it still"
"10919750","10922670"," expects five interest rate cuts this year."
"10923210","10925050"," So let's dig in on all these stories a bit."
"10925350","10927950"," Joining us now is the economist behind that call,"
"10928170","10941470"," David"
"10941470","10944470"," and I will start with you because everybody's focused on rates. "
"10944690","10945210"," And I get that."
"10945810","10951530"," But with the job market showing some cracks with commercial real estate, maybe in the bank showing"
"10951530","10958370"," some cracks, could the Fed focus also shift a little more toward the other side of their twin"
"10958370","10958750"," obligations?"
"10959010","10959650"," And that is jobs."
"10961550","10964650"," Yeah, I think that's a good question, Brian. "
"10964970","10967310"," And I think it may be starting to."
"10968050","10971250"," But I think it needs to do like it needs a little more data to be confident to cut rates."
"10971410","10975350"," It's going to be a little more data of weak job growth in order to make that call. "
"10975850","10978050"," You still have relatively low jobless claims."
"10978730","10982930"," You still have relatively low or but it's higher continuing claims."
"10983430","10988110"," The ADP signaled somewhat weaker employment growth as did the ISM this morning. "
"10988510","10994850"," I think if there's a couple months of weaker job growth, the Fed may increasingly put its focus"
"10994850","10995090"," there."
"10995250","10997610"," It could speed up the timetable a bit."
"10997610","11000990"," But I think the data has to be pretty bad for that to happen. "
"11001530","11002050"," Yeah."
"11002130","11007850"," David, do you expect we will get that kind of to Steve's point quote unquote bad data and see that"
"11007850","11011810"," shift focus from inflation to maximizing employment?"
"11013530","11014790"," Not in the near term."
"11014790","11019910"," I think for now, Chair Powell indicated that there's a pretty high bar for the inflation data to"
"11019910","11024210"," give them the confidence that they want in order to cut by the March meeting. "
"11024210","11031250"," So we push back our base case forecast from March to May more broadly, though, I think you're right"
"11031250","11037470"," that any sign of something going wrong or something looking concerning could get them to cut a"
"11037470","11038390"," little bit more quickly."
"11038830","11042310"," That's why we kept five cuts in the forecast for this year."
"11042610","11047630"," I think there are a lot of scenarios that when you're starting off with a funds right at five and"
"11047630","11053090"," three eights and inflation has been trending reasonably close to two, the labor market looks"
"11053090","11053790"," rebalanced. "
"11054430","11058110"," A lot of scenarios could get you to say, we don't need to be this high."
"11058570","11060330"," We can cut a little bit more quickly."
"11060710","11061810"," Could be a growth scare. "
"11062590","11065990"," Could be labor market data looking a little bit more mixed."
"11066430","11072270"," I think on average, the labor market data are strong, basically comparable to where we were pre"
"11072270","11072810"," pandemic."
"11073030","11074230"," That's the perfect place to be. "
"11074990","11079970"," There happened some conflicting signals could be inflation slowing too much for their liking as"
"11079970","11080110"," well."
"11080850","11082490"," Inflation showing slowing too much."
"11082870","11086830"," I guess you get my point, Steve, because we've been so like laser and hyper focused on inflation"
"11086830","11090410"," for the last three years with, by the way, good reason. "
"11091030","11095650"," It looks like the inflation fight may have been one looking that way, certainly for the data."
"11095890","11098030"," Whether we get a big turn back up, we'll wait and see."
"11098590","11103490"," And I just wonder, seeing what we're seeing at a UPS 12,000 layoffs, a lot of tech stuff coming,"
"11103930","11105690"," the cracks in commercial real estate and banks. "
"11106870","11107830"," You know the Fed very well."
"11108010","11108550"," You know them personally."
"11108550","11114310"," Do you think they're going to have to start to talk about the other things that we really just"
"11114310","11116310"," because jobs have been strong for three years?"
"11118620","11122200"," Well, you know what they say, Brian, it's all good things and all good time. "
"11122360","11127000"," We've had a really good and strong run of jobs."
"11127880","11130940"," It's not entirely clear that we are at balance."
"11131740","11134740"," I would be watching the wage data most specifically. "
"11135080","11140120"," I'm not really sure that you can be too strong when it comes to the number of jobs."
"11140240","11145840"," It's the inflationary pressure from the job market that would concern Powell and company over"
"11145840","11146040"," there."
"11146560","11152700"," And on the downside, I think that you could have a period of time where you had either a hundred"
"11152700","11154100"," thousand or even below that. "
"11154380","11156220"," And that wouldn't be seen as abnormal."
"11156240","11164900"," Remember, Brian, the unemployment rate is just 3.7%. As David says, a couple quick higher numbers."
"11165100","11167460"," If that happened, would get the Fed's attention. "
"11167460","11174320"," But again, they're saying the risks are more balanced, but they're not quite saying that the risks"
"11174320","11174960"," are balanced."
"11175280","11179820"," So they're not where you are, Brian, right now in terms of they're abiding concern about the job"
"11179820","11180420"," market yet."
"11180820","11184060"," David, do you have any concern that inflation could re-flare?"
"11184240","11186440"," I mean, we've had this before in history, right?"
"11186580","11191020"," In the late 70s, early 80s, been times where you think inflation's killed, then it kind of rear in"
"11191020","11193640"," the 70s, rears its ugly head again. "
"11193640","11200360"," Is there any chance anything in your models that suggest that inflation could come back?"
"11200680","11206080"," I think in order for that to happen in a big way, you would need some large external shock that"
"11206080","11208040"," none of us are going to guess today."
"11208600","11212700"," Inflation expectations are back to a level that's compatible with 2%."
"11212700","11218700"," The labor market has been rebalanced from an initial state of overheating back to conditions"
"11218700","11223680"," comparable to where we were pre-pandemic when we had, if anything, a low rather than a high"
"11223680","11224460"," inflation problem. "
"11225160","11231460"," So this starting point, I think, is a very healthy one, a moderate increase in oil prices, a little"
"11231460","11233920"," bit of a further dip in the unemployment rate."
"11234120","11236300"," That's not going to get you into serious trouble."
"11236900","11238880"," You need some big shock coming along. "
"11239160","11243040"," So I think that inflation fight is basically one at this point."
"11243420","11245540"," We have re-anchored inflation expectations."
"11246020","11247800"," We have rebalanced the labor market yet. "
"11248240","11250440"," David, just quickly back to you said the shock."
"11250440","11256560"," Could this, the Red Sea stuff, the shipping stuff, slightly higher oil, off that, could that be, is"
"11256560","11262840"," that a shock or would that not be big enough to create the kind of shock with no all that"
"11262840","11263500"," you're talking about?"
"11264260","11265860"," I think it's not large enough."
"11266180","11270940"," The magnitude of the impact of these things, you know, we've seen plenty of big fluctuations in oil"
"11270940","11273840"," prices in the 20 years before the pandemic. "
"11274100","11279840"," Sure, it matters a little bit for core inflation, for near-term inflation expectations, but it has"
"11279840","11285100"," never created anything like the seriousness of the problem that we had in 2021, 2022."
"11285800","11290740"," So the Red Sea shipping, you know, probably a bigger deal for Europe than the US, but just not"
"11290740","11291360"," large in effect."
"11293660","11298720"," Yeah, Brian, I want to just bring your attention to the idea that what has happened with the Fed"
"11298720","11304560"," funds rate is that they have dialed out or increasingly dialed out the March probability. "
"11305260","11311020"," What they haven't dialed out is what David is talking about is the number of cuts that happen or"
"11311020","11313280"," the amount of cutting that happens this year."
"11313640","11317900"," They're still at, I'm going to give you a fresh quote here, 385 for the year and funds contract."
"11318380","11323680"," So what's happening as you see on your screen now, Brian, is an increasing bet that there could be"
"11323680","11329300"," potential 50 basis point cuts coming as the market says, you know what?"
"11329700","11331120"," I think you're going to the same place. "
"11331480","11332640"," You're just going to have to get there faster."
"11332900","11334640"," So I'm bringing this up for two reasons."
"11334880","11340680"," I want to point out the idea that there are these 50 probabilities in there, but in part, there"
"11340680","11346180"," looks to be some bid on some of these issues here that you and David are talking about that maybe"
"11346180","11351900"," there is a skip in the data, some kind of event that causes or the Fed may need to move"
"11351900","11353300"," faster to catch up. "
"11353800","11360980"," If you look at the June contract, it's actually 50-50 between 25 and a 50 basis point cut."
"11361360","11361800"," Wow."
"11362620","11365440"," In three years of inflation, now we're talking about rate cuts. "
"11365440","11367840"," Nothing is, nothing is certain but change."
"11368320","11370780"," Steve Lee-Spin, David Marickel, thank you very much."
"11371540","11371740"," All right. "
"11371800","11376840"," And since the Federal Reserve seems to be the driver of the stock market these days, let's focus in"
"11376840","11382000"," on it and your money because even though Bank of America's equity sentiment index ticked down a bit"
"11382000","11386100"," recently, your next cast remains bullish on one trade in particular."
"11386660","11388660"," She calls small caps tomorrow's winners."
"11389260","11390000"," And she has four names. "
"11390200","11391120"," She likes for the long term."
"11391760","11393040"," Joining us now is Nancy Prael."
"11393040","11398040"," She is the co CEO and senior fund manager for Essex Investment Management. "
"11399040","11399740"," Nancy, I love it."
"11399840","11403500"," We've been talking about this broadening out of the stock market for three years."
"11403680","11404940"," It hasn't happened. "
"11404980","11407980"," We saw a little bit of it at the end of last year."
"11408340","11411420"," What makes you optimistic on small caps writ large?"
"11412940","11413960"," Well, and you're right."
"11414060","11414840"," It hasn't happened. "
"11414840","11417480"," And we thought we saw the beginning of it in the fourth quarter."
"11417480","11422980"," January obviously was disappointing from the viewpoint of the small cap benchmarks."
"11423760","11428340"," But what we are seeing underneath the surface is in fact some broadening of the market. "
"11428860","11434500"," And even last year in a very challenging year for small caps overall, there were certain segments"
"11434500","11436740"," of the small cap market that did very well."
"11437200","11442560"," We know that tech did well, but beyond tech, we also saw excellent performance in the small cap"
"11442560","11444220"," benchmarks from the industrials area."
"11444220","11451960"," What gives us confidence is that the economic drivers today are the factors that are most favorable"
"11451960","11457900"," for small cap stocks, namely the restoring of manufacturing and the spending on infrastructure and"
"11457900","11465960"," the electrification of the grid or world, everything else combined with very attractive valuations"
"11465960","11467240"," in the small cap space. "
"11467860","11474360"," And perhaps most excitingly for us is the relative positioning of small cap, both in investors"
"11474360","11477600"," portfolios and also in the market at large."
"11478240","11484780"," One of the statistics we particularly like is that today the entire Russell 2000, the small cap"
"11484780","11489440"," stocks are less than 4% of the entire equity market."
"11489740","11493080"," That is the lowest number that we've seen in decades. "
"11493960","11499780"," And it compares to an average weight of six to 7% and a weight in the 80s, since we've"
"11499780","11504660"," been talking about the 70s and some of the parallels there, a weight in the 80s and the 90s between"
"11504660","11506240"," 10 and 13%."
"11506240","11510100"," That's a lot of room for improvement as these names come back into favor."
"11510300","11511340"," All right, let's go through a few names. "
"11511500","11513780"," I'm not sure we'll get to all four because the long winded anchor."
"11513780","11514920"," But here we go, Nancy."
"11515720","11518140"," I like invent and it's the letter N V."
"11518420","11522560"," So ticker is N-V-T electrified world, kind of the EV. "
"11522680","11527100"," You're not worried about the slowdown that we're seeing kind of in the EV space that the"
"11527100","11530120"," electrification trend obviously you believe will still continue."
"11531120","11536600"," Well, the biggest driver for the electrification trend is not actually EVs."
"11537340","11538640"," It is generative AI. "
"11539220","11544500"," When we look at the build out of data centers that we are seeing and that we think we will"
"11544500","11549960"," continue to see that requires a tremendous amount of power to drive that."
"11550400","11554080"," In addition, we know that we've recently seen the launch of Bitcoin ETFs."
"11554380","11557660"," If you are bull on Bitcoin, that also requires data centers. "
"11558200","11560880"," EnVent is a player in those data centers."
"11561420","11567320"," And they're really focused on both the bricks and mortar, if you will, of enclosures and metal"
"11567320","11573980"," boxes to hold the data, to hold the servers, but also on thermal management, which is increasingly"
"11573980","11576980"," important, particularly in these big data centers."
"11577300","11579420"," So we think that they have great growth. "
"11579640","11583260"," I'll say the amount of energy that we're going to need, the electrification, we're going to need"
"11583260","11588080"," hamsters in a billion hamsters and a billion wheels generating power."
"11588580","11595500"," I'm going to skip two more Patrick Industries, P-A-T-K, building products for marine, power sports,"
"11596140","11596540"," RVs."
"11596940","11601820"," That would seem to be a little bit risky if there is a consumer slowdown. "
"11603420","11605680"," Well, it is in that sense."
"11605960","11610140"," However, what we like about Patrick, but there are a couple of things we like about Patrick."
"11610400","11615360"," One is incredibly well-rooted. "
"11615360","11619140"," The reason we like it now, and it's been a strong stock, it's not that it's completely"
"11619140","11626100"," undiscovered, but we are at the end of an inventory cycle on the RV side, where you think we're"
"11626100","11630320"," near the end on the marine side, and they've just entered the power sports industry."
"11630980","11637400"," These are inventories, not Patrick Industries, but inventories of the RVs and the boats, et cetera."
"11637620","11641500"," We're seeing sequential improvement in sales and sell-through. "
"11641500","11649140"," Patrick has distinguished themselves through other cycles by continuing to gain dollars of content"
"11649140","11651600"," within their core customer markets."
"11651840","11654700"," As I mentioned, power sports is a relatively new area for them."
"11655360","11660900"," Two billion T.A.M. additional, so we think they can execute well even in a somewhat challenging"
"11660900","11661360"," environment. "
"11662100","11664040"," Nancy Prowl, we appreciate the views."
"11664260","11665520"," The other two names, I'll just say them."
"11665680","11667360"," Dosebo and Digi International. "
"11667920","11668260"," Love the picks."
"11668900","11669200"," Some new names."
"11669340","11670020"," Nancy, thank you. "
"11670860","11671540"," Thank you."
"11671800","11672780"," All right, we are just getting going on."
"11672800","11674020"," A lot more to do on deck. "
"11674300","11680580"," Seventy-four current party take 503.548 billion dollars at the Fed Reversary Corporation."
"11680860","11684380"," In Amazon, the numbers and the narrative to know ahead of that."
"11684540","11689800"," Plus, with all the layoff announcement lately, tomorrow's job numbers be another sign of some"
"11689800","11692240"," growing weakness or not. "
"11692860","11695420"," We'll talk about it where the opportunities may be for workers."
"11696260","11697660"," VHJ, in fact, after this."
"11700400","11703380"," This is the exchange on CNBC. "
"11704540","11709540"," New work for our service for the price of one month and save 92%."
"11783700","11786400"," Submitting natural gas features, extending losses."
"11786820","11789800"," Our price is falling below the lowest since May 2023. "
"11857340","11858500"," Asset.com."
"11859500","11860980"," All right, welcome back to the exchange."
"11861500","11866100"," We've got more mega-cap tech earnings on deck, and we, of course, have full team coverage covering"
"11866100","11868380"," every, I mean, every angle for you."
"11868920","11871780"," Steve Kovac is in Cupertino, California, outside of Apple's HQ. "
"11872420","11876740"," Kate Rooney has a look at what to expect from Amazon and clockwise capital partner and portfolio"
"11876740","11882160"," manager, James Chockmock, is here with the trade and why he is throwing out more than half the MAG"
"11882160","11885020"," 7 and sticking with just three big names."
"11885080","11885860"," It's going to be a big block."
"11886160","11891100"," So let's start with, I guess, Steve, formerly the biggest market cap company in the world, and that"
"11891100","11891700"," is Apple. "
"11893800","11894720"," Yeah, that's right."
"11895000","11901060"," And it's a pretty dreary day here, but analysts expecting a not so dreary report in the sense of"
"11901060","11907420"," Apple returning to that top line sales growth for the first time after a full fiscal year, that's"
"11907420","11909880"," four quarters in a row of declining sales."
"11910140","11911420"," Now, comps are a little bit wonky. "
"11911760","11915900"," There's a week shorter than before, the quarter of the last year, and all that."
"11916160","11920040"," But overall, analysts expecting about $118 billion in revenue."
"11920720","11924340"," That would be about half a percent sales growth for those keeping score at home. "
"11924340","11929060"," But, of course, there are so many headwinds and other questions throughout the rest of the year,"
"11929280","11934920"," Brian, one being China and this renewed competition Apple is facing now with Huawei, the Chinese"
"11934920","11938460"," smartphone brand that was out of this smartphone game for a couple of years there."
"11938880","11943400"," Now they're back, and we've been seeing some initial data coming out over the last few months"
"11943400","11946280"," saying, you know, Huawei is actually taking share away from Apple."
"11946840","11949800"," And that is why Brian Guidance is going to be super important. "
"11949980","11955300"," We also got some reports earlier this week from analysts Ming Ching Kuo, a top supply chain"
"11955300","11961900"," analyst, when it comes to Apple saying Apple is planning to ship 15 percent fewer iPhones this year"
"11961900","11964640"," throughout 2024 than they did a year ago."
"11964880","11966400"," So listen to the call, Brian."
"11966620","11971920"," That is going to be super important when we get that March quarter guidance from CFO Luca Maestri. "
"11972500","11976640"," What does the rest of the year, what does the spring quarter look like and what does the rest of"
"11976640","11977500"," the year look like?"
"11977900","11981220"," I'll also note we're on the eve of the Vision Pro launch."
"11981220","11984660"," This is Apple's first major new product in nine years."
"11984980","11989620"," That was 2015 when we got the Apple watch, Vision Pro going on sale tomorrow. "
"11989620","11995320"," So I'm expecting to hear Tim Cook, who, by the way, graced the cover of Vanity Fair today."
"11995640","12001540"," First time we've seen him wearing a Vision Pro in person or photograph like that."
"12001640","12001940"," There you go. "
"12002020","12002620"," You see him right there."
"12002960","12006940"," So expecting some color about the Vision Pro launch as well, Brian."
"12007300","12011880"," Well, I'm excited because tonight on last call, 7 p.m. Eastern for Pacific tune in, we're going to"
"12011880","12013520"," actually have the Vision Pro on set. "
"12013680","12017100"," I'm going to throw one on and literally be on TV live."
"12017780","12021880"," It's going to be like real reality, augmented reality, all at the same time."
"12022040","12022860"," My mind is already blown. "
"12023520","12026160"," Is it still though, Steve, with the Apple all about the iPhone?"
"12026160","12028160"," Does iCloud matter?"
"12028380","12029980"," Because I don't know about you, my man, but I know this."
"12030200","12036740"," I'm paying Apple a boatload of money every month for storage, apps, services, subscriptions, et"
"12036740","12037700"," cetera."
"12039140","12041220"," You are Apple's favorite kind of customer. "
"12041480","12046620"," And that's the services business right there, which has in the last couple quarters showed some"
"12046620","12049620"," renewed growth, double digit percentage growth again."
"12049840","12054420"," There's a kind of law coming out of the pandemic as people were spending less on apps and services."
"12055320","12057340"," But that's kind of resurging again, Brian, to your point. "
"12057660","12062420"," All those subscriptions that you take, that you subscribe to through the app store, Apple gets a"
"12062420","12064560"," slice of every one of those subscriptions."
"12065200","12071200"," And so we often hear Apple say, you know, we have this many millions or hundreds of millions rather"
"12071200","12072940"," of subscriptions through the app store."
"12073360","12076140"," All of that is a sign that they're taking a cut from it. "
"12076280","12078500"," So yes, services will be another big number."
"12078700","12083800"," And iPhone, of course, the biggest part of the business expected to grow a little bit, especially"
"12083800","12088840"," because a year ago, there were so many production problems in China due to COVID shutdowns."
"12089020","12093220"," So there will be a little bit of easier comps and some growth to show and bear most likely for"
"12093220","12093880"," the iPhone, Brian. "
"12094140","12095460"," All right, Steve, long day ahead."
"12095580","12097020"," We'll look forward to pricing tonight as well."
"12097240","12097960"," Steve, thank you very much. "
"12098520","12098820"," All right."
"12099060","12099260"," Amazon."
"12099700","12102720"," Meantime is not all about e-commerce anymore. "
"12103240","12107740"," One big thing that investors are watching now is, of course, Amazon Web Services."
"12108620","12111580"," Kate Rooney here now with more on what to expect from Amazon."
"12111900","12112000"," Kate. "
"12112700","12113340"," Hey, Brian."
"12113500","12117720"," Yeah, investors are watching Amazon Web Services, AWS, because it's really become the company's"
"12117720","12118400"," profit engine."
"12119020","12124380"," Expectations for AWS are now high after both Microsoft, and you had Google reporting strong cloud"
"12124380","12126100"," growth on their cloud competitors. "
"12126340","12128340"," It's all about that revenue growth rate."
"12128680","12131980"," So AWS has been lingering at around 12% the past two quarters."
"12131980","12135080"," You can see that on the right side there a little over a year ago, though. "
"12135360","12137140"," It was up in the 30% range."
"12137400","12140840"," 33% back in 2022 there."
"12141080","12141560"," 13%. "
"12141560","12143500"," That is the number to beat today, Brian."
"12143700","12148560"," Piper Sandler calls it the bogey and says that will determine the outcome for the stock today."
"12148680","12149580"," Also watch spending. "
"12149900","12151920"," So Google and Microsoft reported this week."
"12152380","12154760"," Both called out catbacks increases thanks to AI."
"12155020","12157820"," They called it notable and material in both cases. "
"12158020","12162340"," Expect some commentary on where Amazon stands and that AI race and how they're going to monetize"
"12162340","12162460"," it."
"12162700","12164780"," And then there's that core e-commerce business."
"12165360","12169380"," Still key investors are expecting some margin improvement over there, especially in its North"
"12169380","12170400"," American retail business. "
"12170560","12175100"," They are looking for upside on the advertising business as well for Amazon launching ads and prime"
"12175100","12175460"," video."
"12175460","12180540"," Investors are looking for some cost savings after going through multiple rounds of layoffs as Jeff"
"12180540","12181180"," Breeze put it."
"12181380","12185320"," They are now in harvest mode as they continue to optimize the cost structure. "
"12185460","12189160"," Amazon's investment in EV make a Rivian could be a drag on that income."
"12189440","12193820"," So watch that Rivian shares are down more than 30% this year."
"12194120","12194260"," Brian. "
"12194960","12195320"," All right."
"12195440","12196820"," So Amazon Web Services."
"12197640","12199100"," You've got the stake in Rivian. "
"12199300","12203400"," But I got to imagine that e-commerce still matters."
"12203400","12210240"," I mean, how many boxes of La Croix water or toilet paper, whatever they're shipping out, right?"
"12210500","12213680"," Because everybody you know probably has a cardboard box on their step."
"12214260","12215420"," A hundred percent. "
"12215580","12217360"," Prime is really key here."
"12217500","12218240"," It's that flywheel effect."
"12218400","12220260"," They've raised prices when it comes to prime. "
"12220440","12226260"," And they talked about that this week even getting that timing from where a box is in a warehouse to"
"12226260","12227340"," your front door is key."
"12227500","12228220"," They're making that faster."
"12228980","12230420"," And part of that is regionalization. "
"12230420","12236400"," So moving the warehouse is closer to where people are using AI in some cases to kind of anticipate,"
"12236400","12240380"," you know, if you're in Arizona, you might need sunscreen if you're in the Bay Area, you know, maybe"
"12240380","12240640"," not."
"12240860","12244260"," So they are using AI to kind of anticipate customer needs."
"12244760","12247820"," E-commerce is still big, but not as high margin as AWS. "
"12248100","12250880"," And that's why investors really watch that side of the business."
"12251120","12252140"," It's become the profit engine."
"12252680","12257360"," But e-commerce on the revenue top line is still much bigger, but just not as profitable. "
"12258020","12261160"," Okay, Rooney also have a just bizarre premonition."
"12261380","12262480"," We'll see you again later today."
"12262500","12262780"," Kate. "
"12262920","12263720"," Thank you very much."
"12263760","12264740"," All right."
"12264740","12265020"," Yeah. "
"12265160","12265440"," Exactly."
"12265660","12266660"," Or for your time."
"12266780","12266920"," All right. "
"12267020","12269600"," Your next test says forget the magnificent seven."
"12269680","12275820"," It's more like the mag three or terrific three focusing more on meta Amazon and Microsoft."
"12276260","12277940"," He says it's time to hedge on tech. "
"12278440","12280900"," The sector could be due for a full back, huh?"
"12281380","12284020"," Joining us now is clockwise capital partner and portfolio manager."
"12284540","12284960"," James."
"12285140","12285560"," Chuck. "
"12285680","12285980"," James."
"12286140","12286940"," Good to see you again."
"12287200","12291160"," I notice that in your terrific three, we got to come up with a new name. "
"12291160","12293040"," Of course, you know, super stakes terrific."
"12293180","12293880"," Whatever it is."
"12294220","12297340"," Apple was not on the list. "
"12299680","12300100"," Yeah."
"12300120","12305320"," Essentially the way we think about the names that we want to lean into and truly overweight is"
"12305320","12309080"," based on how predictable is the revenue picture and the earnings outlook."
"12309640","12314320"," And on top of that, how much optionality is priced in or not priced into these stocks?"
"12314320","12321640"," And we think among the seven only Amazon, uh, meta and Microsoft, uh, have that productive"
"12321640","12323640"," predictability as well as optionality. "
"12323860","12327520"," And the other ones, you know, we have question marks on like as Steve was reporting, you know,"
"12327740","12332200"," what, what happens with Apple shipments, iPhone shipments, uh, this year Tesla kind of throwing"
"12332200","12336740"," their hands up in the air on, um, on unit sales for the year."
"12336800","12339020"," So there's more questions than answers on before."
"12339340","12341520"," So we're leaning into the into those three. "
"12341520","12341600"," Great."
"12341840","12342140"," Yeah."
"12342260","12344760"," And you heard Steve talking about Apple and I'm not picking on them again. "
"12345080","12346840"," Uh, you know, everyone loves their iPhone."
"12347060","12350560"," What I'm saying is that it feels like Apple is, is a phone company."
"12350860","12351820"," They've got augmented reality. "
"12351880","12353820"," It's going to be cool, but that's got to be a niche product."
"12353820","12354880"," Of course, the Mac book."
"12355040","12355560"," They're great. "

"12376740","12383460"," Um, you know, some of the parts doesn't always add up to, to how, uh, investors, um, analyze and"
"12383460","12384360"," value these companies. "
"12384840","12388600"," So on an earnings basis, you know, we think around 30 times is the right number."

"12435680","12436180"," What happened?"
"12438050","12441810"," Well it was really just Apple changing its privacy standards."
"12441890","12442310"," That was it."

"12454430","12459370"," But you had to toggle it on by manually for non-Apple services."
"12459650","12466110"," So what what's interesting about it is yes, that was a really tough year for a per meta, but they"
"12466110","12469130"," actually came out of that stronger and more defensible. "
"12469850","12475150"," And the changes that they made and the improvements that they made in the on the targeting side"
"12475150","12480970"," actually made their products stronger and ultimately yielding higher ROI conversions for for"

"13004350","13006730"," I referenced in the T's going to break."
"13006750","13008510"," Is it merely because the calendar?"
"13008790","13012850"," What I mean by that is we often tend to see a lot of layoffs at the beginning of a"
"13012850","13013170"," year."
"13013750","13017450"," Companies can then it sort of adjust their books on the earlier side. "
"13017450","13022770"," Do you view this more as a January specific trend that'll slow down?"
"13023030","13027990"," Or are we could we expect a growth in more layoffs the remainder of the year?"
"13029570","13032410"," First of all Brian good to see you and thanks for having me on."
"13033050","13034970"," It's a very complex job market."
"13035410","13040710"," I think the layoffs in tech like a company like Salesforce that announces that they're laying off"
"13040710","13043870"," 700 people are still hiring a thousand other people. "
"13044170","13048510"," So there's clearly a changing of their overall staffing in the IT space."
"13049470","13052190"," But healthcare still is strong."
"13052450","13057910"," You know healthcare is still on our top three areas that the recruiters are recruiting for followed"
"13057910","13059210"," by IT and sales. "
"13059830","13061410"," Nice to see that sales is up there."
"13061830","13066730"," I think there's still this notion of if I need to come up with really good earnings the fastest way"
"13066730","13072410"," to do that was really to was really to lay off staff and to reduce my overall operating expenses."
"13073070","13078710"," I think we're going to see that growth in sales really nice to see that because once I'm done"
"13078710","13084310"," making cut costs cutting measures the next is really to grow my revenues and how do I do that but"
"13084310","13084790"," through sales?"
"13086150","13093950"," Yeah and I think you nailed it on the job market because not only is it just matching talent with"
"13093950","13099230"," companies which is what you guys do and do very well but also are you willing to work from home?"
"13099690","13101130"," Are you willing to go into an office?"
"13101550","13104730"," Will you go into an office or will you choose to go into an office?"
"13105130","13109610"," It used to just be about pay and I know that's a huge deal still and it always will be"
"13109610","13111210"," heaven but you get my point. "
"13111730","13116170"," There are other things that employers I'm sure are asking people right now."
"13117230","13121650"," Absolutely you know a really interesting January effect and I think you nailed it on the head."
"13122130","13127170"," We saw a really serious increase a hundred percent increase in people looking for new experiences. "
"13127550","13133490"," Now that number went from 8% to 16% so it's still a relatively low number but all of"
"13133490","13138130"," a sudden now hey it's the new year I want a new experience and it's okay to leave your job."
"13138390","13145130"," I think what the pandemic really proved is that it's okay to leave a job earlier than two years,"
"13145250","13150330"," three years, four years, ten years and so we don't we believe that that's never going to change or"
"13150330","13154610"," we're going to go back to where it's okay to leave a job and you're going to get for the"
"13154610","13154750"," goals."
"13154930","13158930"," I don't want to go back to the office or I want a new experience Let me go find a"
"13158930","13160730"," job, a really interesting statistic. "
"13161090","13162370"," There you go, you put it right up here now."
"13162670","13168450"," 41% of the recruiters of the survey of the recruiter index survey said that 75 to 100% of"
"13168450","13169850"," their candidates are currently employed."
"13170610","13172530"," That's a pretty sizable number. "
"13173550","13177750"," So that means that we're pulling people out of other companies in order to fill those roles."
"13178850","13180050"," Yeah, how do we read that?"
"13180470","13182550"," 41% of recruit, I mean, I'm reading it."
"13182650","13183990"," I mean, I'm not, can I read it?"
"13184070","13185270"," 41% I hope I can. "
"13185270","13189330"," 41% of recruiters is 75% to 100% of candidates are currently employed."
"13189890","13190210"," First time it's ever happened."
"13190210","13193870"," So the guitar official tells the whys that Hamas has received the proposal positively, but there's"
"13193870","13195770"," just nobody on the job market right now. "
"13195830","13201130"," You have a Qatari official here telling you why the Hamas has received the proposal positively, but"
"13201130","13202090"," he's not a springer yet."
"13202130","13204690"," Their current company has started dating somebody new."
"13205290","13205830"," That's right. "
"13206010","13209690"," So if the quid rates are down, think about the quid rates are down, and you look at the Jolt"
"13209690","13212310"," number, they're down 20% year over year."
"13212310","13219510"," So meaning the December quit rate of 23 was 20% lower than the December quit rate of 22."
"13220090","13225890"," So the only way to really get people out of their job is to actively and proactively bring them to"
"13225890","13226310"," opportunities. "
"13226850","13230590"," And that's really when you start to use a recruiter to do that overall activity."
"13231470","13235190"," So we saw the number of people applying for roles increase."
"13235830","13237810"," We saw a slight increase in the number of open roles. "
"13237810","13239770"," The sentiment remains the same."
"13239990","13241110"," So people still are concerned."
"13241690","13243970"," The recruiters still are concerned about the overall market. "
"13244790","13245410"," Yeah, Evan."
"13245530","13246110"," We got to leave it there."
"13246230","13248010"," Cut you a bit short because you have some breaking news. "
"13248130","13248690"," They've been jabbers."
"13248830","13249790"," Evan, you're welcome back anytime."
"13250190","13250770"," Love having you on. "
"13250890","13251310"," Great stats."
"13251310","13251850"," Great stuff."
"13252070","13252430"," Thank you, Evan. "
"13253650","13254190"," All right."
"13254210","13256170"," So here's the news shares for for profit."
"13256370","13260190"," Higher education ad tell them have been halted due to news pending. "
"13260190","13260990"," Amen."
"13261190","13262370"," Jabra is joining us now."
"13262490","13262630"," Amen. "
"13263170","13265490"," Do we know what that pending news may be?"
"13265890","13266490"," Yeah, Brian."
"13266610","13267650"," We do know what the news is."
"13267790","13269170"," And I've got it in my hands here. "
"13269250","13271170"," It's a five page press release from the company."
"13271510","13275310"," This is the reason why the shares have been halted here in the afternoon."
"13275310","13280550"," And this is a response by Ad Tellum, the for profit education company to the short seller report"
"13280550","13286170"," that you remember came out earlier this week from short seller Fami Kadir and her firm, Safqet"
"13286170","13292070"," Capital, they blasted Ad Tellum earlier this week with the report suggesting that Ad Tellum was"
"13292070","13297170"," facing future funding crunches, future difficulties in recruiting students to their for profit"
"13297170","13299230"," universities and educational programs. "
"13300030","13306390"," And the like that on Tuesday took about a 20% haircut off of Ad Tellum shares before they"
"13306390","13309130"," stabilized in the after hours trading that evening."
"13309670","13314090"," Today, Ad Tellum is now responding with their version of events here."
"13314090","13319690"," They are going through the Safqet Capital report point by point and refuting each point in this"
"13319690","13321550"," five page press release that they just put out. "
"13321670","13323970"," This is the reason why shares were halted."
"13324250","13325370"," And this news is now out."
"13326030","13328890"," It's just to give you a sense of the argument here. "
"13329290","13333890"," Ad Tellum says in this release, while presenting itself as an advocacy effort in service of student"
"13333890","13339450"," borrowers and taxpayers, in fact, the Safqet Capital report amounts to nothing more than a thinly"
"13339450","13345210"," veiled and deceptively constructed short and distort scheme designed to extract a quick return at"
"13345210","13348890"," the expense of Ad Tellum students, faculty, employees and shareholders."
"13349450","13352050"," So that is the tone of this press release."
"13352430","13357470"," And they go through point by point in responding to each of Fami Kadir's criticisms of the company. "
"13357650","13362210"," But this is not news pending in terms of, you know, there's an acquisition out there or something"
"13362210","13364410"," that's happened to the CEO who's resigning or anything like that."
"13364410","13370110"," This is news pending for a press release, which is an argument, effectively, as to why that short"
"13370110","13373630"," seller report was inaccurate and why investors shouldn't trust it."
"13373730","13380390"," I can tell you also, Brian, that I talked to Fami Kadir yesterday about her reaction to all of this"
"13380390","13382710"," after the market digested her short report. "
"13383110","13386310"," She told me she put on additional short sales yesterday."
"13386530","13391630"," She was unconvinced by the company's earnings report, which the company early it up to Tuesday."
"13391630","13392670"," It was supposed to come out today. "
"13392790","13395030"," The early it up to Tuesday in response to all of this."
"13395190","13400370"," So some real drama here in this name, Brian, as Ad Tellum is now fighting back against the short"
"13400370","13400530"," seller."
"13400810","13402810"," Yeah, not a probably household name. "
"13402970","13407790"," They own the American School of Medicine, the Caribbean, Ross University, a veterinary university"
"13407790","13411070"," as well that are kind of for profit around the country and the Caribbean."
"13411770","13412550"," Fascinating story."
"13412830","13415630"," We'll see if and when Ad Tellum starts trading again. "
"13415630","13416010"," Amen."
"13416050","13416530"," Jivers."
"13416750","13417010"," Thank you. "
"13417590","13417990"," All right."
"13418070","13423690"," Coming up is the IPO market finally about to wake up or fall back to sleep after kind of a"
"13423690","13425710"," sad, sack debut for a new name today."
"13608450","13609530"," To learn more. "
"13614140","13614700"," All right."
"13614760","13615080"," Welcome back."
"13615240","13618700"," Well, the IPO market seems to be picking up the pace this year. "
"13618920","13619180"," A bit."
"13619460","13620040"," A peril maker."
"13620420","13625980"," Amherst sports debuting on the NYSE today with Reddit and she and two other names expected a list"
"13625980","13626780"," in the coming months. "
"13627440","13632140"," But the billion dollar question is, are these really the IPOs that Wall Street wants?"
"13632760","13635460"," Dude, you're both digging into that for today's tech check."
"13635860","13641760"," So Sally, if you're like me and you love IPOs, all new listings, I'm sure we're going to get some"
"13641760","13643200"," exciting names this year."
"13643440","13648860"," But these are not like the life changing disruptive companies that Wall Street is so anxious for. "
"13648960","13649420"," Look at this graphic."
"13650040","13652520"," On one side, we have the IPOs that Wall Street wants."
"13652520","13658680"," These are those big disruptive names, 40, 50 billion dollar plus valuations like ByteDance, SpaceX,"
"13659360","13665060"," Stripe, Databricks, their household names or their Silicon Valley darlings that investors you would"
"13665060","13667500"," think might be clamoring over themselves to get a piece of. "
"13667700","13671160"," On the right side of your screen, you see the IPOs that Wall Street is getting."
"13671480","13674520"," These are the candidates for this year, the likely candidates, I should say."
"13674600","13677140"," You've got Discord, Reddit, Skims, Plaid, Chime. "
"13678000","13682680"," I'm going to put she in a different category in a moment, but these are likely, you know, dollar"
"13682680","13685400"," valuations, solid business model, perhaps."
"13685780","13689840"," We'll have to judge once you get those S1s, but, you know, they're not the big and exciting names."
"13689940","13695240"," And part of that is there's this disconnect because the bigger flashier buzzier private companies,"
"13695380","13698260"," they can continue to tap private markets for funding. "
"13698520","13699920"," So that pushes out an IPO."
"13700120","13700500"," They can wait."
"13700560","13704540"," There's also a little bit of stigma, especially here in Silicon Valley, about going public and"
"13704540","13709720"," being a slave to the quarterly report, whereas the other companies that aren't quite so buzzy that"
"13709720","13715800"," might not generate as much interest in, by the way, may not perform quite as well, they can't tap"
"13715800","13718600"," private markets as easily, so they need to turn to IPOs. "
"13718900","13723220"," Brian, I said that she is in a bit of a different category because this one, at least to me,"
"13723360","13724540"," is very, very exciting."
"13724980","13726240"," It is sort of a disruptor."
"13726300","13730580"," It's been making huge waves over here in the U.S., even though it's a Chinese company or"
"13730580","13732560"," Singaporean as it wants to be seen. "
"13732980","13733500"," That's up for debate."
"13734100","13739020"," But that one right now even looks to be in a little bit of parallel you had a report that"
"13739640","13744860"," existing investors were looking to sell shares in the private market because already there's being"
"13744860","13746900"," some cold water being thrown on that one."
"13747460","13752760"," Yeah, and by the way, she in eats my timeline on X with other ads, probably in other platforms as"
"13752760","13752960"," well. "
"13753180","13754360"," But here's the thing."
"13754780","13758260"," You're out there in Silicon Valley, home of venture capital, right, in private equity, all this"
"13758260","13758440"," stuff."
"13758840","13761780"," You just feel like more and more money is just being made. "
"13761920","13763480"," We talked about it on my show last night."
"13764000","13765840"," More and more money is being made in the private markets."
"13766000","13767620"," In other words, the real money. "
"13767620","13768640"," The big money."
"13768840","13775860"," They get in on the companies before they go public and that's where you get the 30,000 square foot"
"13775860","13776680"," house in Atherton."
"13777180","13778920"," I mean, that's always been the case, right?"
"13779200","13783260"," Venture capital works on this idea that you're going to invest in a hundred companies and one of"
"13783260","13785700"," them may turn out to be your lottery ticket, right?"
"13785780","13789020"," You might have invested in the Uber or the Airbnb. "
"13790320","13791780"," They need exits, right?"
"13792060","13792980"," And that's venture capital."
"13793180","13795080"," Private markets typically lag the public markets."
"13795560","13796560"," They do need exits. "
"13796560","13798480"," They need more of their companies to go public."
"13798840","13802280"," It doesn't even have to do that well because they got into them at such early stages."
"13802460","13806860"," But there's another dynamic at play, which is new over the last 18 months or so. "
"13807080","13809220"," And that is mega cap tech money."
"13809580","13813740"," Billions and billions of dollars more than the venture capital world has really ever seen."
"13813760","13818020"," Save maybe South Bank or Tiger Global investing billions and billions of dollars into these new"
"13818020","13822520"," generative AI darlings like OpenAI and Inthropic, but also some of the smaller ones, right?"
"13822840","13824700"," They're fetching billion dollar valuations easily. "
"13824700","13828560"," They're unlikely to go public as well because money's flush for them."
"13828920","13829360"," That's it."
"13829840","13834140"," Deirdre Bosa, a shoe-in for she-in, Deirdre, thank you. "
"13834820","13835080"," I try."
"13835680","13842660"," Coming up, big oil, bleach, and boots, we've got the action, the story, and the trade on some of"
"13842660","13850480"," the names, not in technology set to release their numbers, stick around."
"14012630","14017190"," We talked about it at the top, got a lot of tech names, Apple, Amazon, and more reporting out to"
"14017190","14017670"," the bill today. "
"14017850","14024790"," But there's also numbers coming out of non-tech, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Clorox, and Sketcher shoes"
"14024790","14025550"," all on deck."
"14026070","14031350"," Joining us with his trade for today's earning exchange is Chris Grisanti, MAI Capital Management's"
"14031350","14033150"," Chief Equity Strategist, Chris."
"14033710","14034430"," Good to have you on. "
"14034610","14039270"," Let's start off with, I almost called it, Shexan, which I just combined the two names."
"14039450","14039950"," Maybe they should."
"14039950","14040070"," Good. "
"14040250","14040910"," Someday they'll merge."
"14041130","14041250"," That's right."
"14041350","14044030"," And let me know if Shexan, and it sounds like a video game or so. "
"14044190","14044770"," Yeah, it's perfect."
"14045410","14051130"," ExxonMobil and Chevron, oil prices in focus, geopolitical tensions continue to rise as well."
"14051590","14053490"," What are you looking for from ExxonMobil?"
"14054650","14056350"," You know, Brian, I'm positive on the oil. "
"14056590","14057410"," It's good to be with you again."
"14057790","14059810"," You know, for these guys, CAPX is down."
"14060330","14063190"," They have a lot of levers to pull to return capital to shareholders. "
"14063670","14068650"," And, of course, the problems in the Middle East have put a floor under oil pricing really for the"
"14068650","14069490"," foreseeable future."
"14069490","14074950"," So I'm not sure what the number is going to be, but I feel comfortable owning these things in front"
"14074950","14075390"," of the number."
"14075850","14076290"," Okay. "
"14076430","14076510"," Yeah."
"14076730","14080850"," Chevron underperformed and maybe turning it around, by the way, you got Chevron on CNBC."
"14080870","14082290"," I believe it is tomorrow. "
"14082630","14083450"," Let's talk about Clorox."
"14083670","14087230"," I mean, Clorox is all the rage during COVID, bleach and everything, right?"
"14087910","14090210"," What's your view now on Clorox?"
"14091030","14093930"," Who are just going back to kind of being a slow grower, give it in company?"
"14094650","14094930"," Yeah."
"14095110","14096410"," It's a classic value name. "
"14096410","14100630"," They've been absolutely killed with the devaluation of the peso in Argentina."
"14101190","14104410"," So all eyes are really going to be on that Argentine problem, Brian."
"14104770","14107330"," So I think expectations are quite low there. "
"14107970","14112990"," I think the company is poised for long-term recovery, not just in Argentina, but in really many"
"14112990","14113450"," locations."
"14114050","14117230"," So I would be an investor there."
"14117370","14118130"," I like the setup. "
"14118650","14124850"," If I'm wrong and Argentina is still a problem, I probably, I think it would be attractive on the"
"14124850","14124950"," week."
"14124950","14125650"," Very quickly."
"14126010","14126570"," Thirty seconds. "
"14127030","14127310"," Sketchers."
"14128310","14128790"," Sketchers."
"14129110","14129730"," Great company. "
"14130190","14133670"," Stocks done quite well since late October, though, up about 35%."
"14133670","14137930"," I wouldn't get in front of the earnings because I think there's probably a little more risk than"
"14137930","14139650"," reward in the short term."
"14140050","14142930"," But again, if there's weakness here, I'd like to be an owner long-term. "
"14143770","14146570"," Chris Grisanti, MAI Capital Management."
"14146790","14148690"," We did a lot there in a short amount of time, and I love it."
"14148870","14149670"," Thank you, Brian. "
"14149930","14150870"," Thank you very much."
"14150990","14151830"," Really appreciate that."
"14151830","14152190"," All right. "
"14152530","14154910"," Folks, that does it for us here and me on the exchange."
"14155670","14159970"," But of course, tuning tonight, 7 p.m. Eastern, 4 p.m. Pacific, for last call."
"14160630","14161190"," That is tonight. "
"14161490","14164390"," The power lunch starts on the other side of this quick break."
"14164650","14165010"," We'll see you there."
"14317650","14318310"," For the planet. "
"14325860","14329300"," Well, the power lunch, everybody, alongside Courtney Reagan, I'm Tyler Matheson."
"14329480","14333900"," Despite a record-breaking rally, there is always, always something for the markets to worry about."
"14333900","14337000"," A regional bank stock losing half its value in the past two days. "
"14337000","14341260"," Could we be in for a replay of that crisis from a year or so ago?"
"14341460","14346140"," And mega-cap tech earnings, Meta Amazon, Apple Oil, reporting today is a big day."
"14346340","14348140"," Can they meet lofty expectations?"
"14348840","14351680"," Plus, the world's number one female golfer will join us."
"14351680","14356240"," She's got a new corporate sponsor, and there's also a deal to beef up the prize money for the"
"14356240","14357060"," women's U.S. Open. "
"14357220","14358100"," We'll discuss that more."
"14358260","14362480"," But first, let's get you a quick check on the markets, as you tried to say, on this Thursday."
"14362480","14367100"," We are a hire across the board, Dow Jones Industrial Average, higher by 7-tenths of a percent, S&P"
"14367100","14371620"," 500, higher by 9-tenths of a percent, and the NASDAQ leading the way, making up some of yesterday's"
"14371620","14374020"," losses by about a percent foreshow. "
"14374380","14379000"," Check out shares of New York Community Bank down again today after losing more than a third of its"
"14379000","14382680"," value yesterday after the company lost money and slashed its dividend."
"14383380","14386020"," Week to date down 43 percent."
"14386260","14391860"," Other regional banks falling for the second straight day in sympathy, if one bank can literally"
"14391860","14393060"," have sympathy for another. "
"14393300","14398840"," But the question is whether these issues are NYCBs alone or whether they could spread as we saw"
"14398840","14400680"," with Silicon Valley Bank last year."
"14400840","14403880"," Let's bring in Leslie Picker now for some analysis."
"14403880","14404380"," Leslie. "
"14404680","14406460"," Yeah, Tyler, that is the key question today."
"14406760","14411660"," The fallout from New York Community Bank Corp continues, those shares, as you mentioned, adding to"
"14411660","14417100"," yesterday's 38 percent declines currently down more than eight and a half percent."
"14417660","14422580"," NYCB's fourth quarter earnings yesterday revealing a biting slump in credit quality thanks to"
"14422580","14427940"," troubled loans for a co-op within its multifamily portfolio and an office CRE loan. "
"14428260","14433600"," For many bank investors, it was the deja vu eliciting fears of contagion akin to what they"
"14433600","14439460"," experienced last spring, even more ironic, since NYCB acquired part of Signature's balance sheet"
"14439460","14444000"," from FDIC receivership after that bank failed last March."
"14444000","14450320"," The question now is whether NYCB's issues are isolated to that one bank or whether there is broader"
"14450320","14451940"," systemic risk at play."
"14452320","14456860"," Bank of America analysts say that the regional bank sell-off is likely overdone, quote, given"
"14456860","14463640"," idiosyncratic factors tied to NYCB, but from notes that NYCB crossing the $100 billion in assets"
"14463640","14468660"," threshold after acquiring Signature subjects them to a whole host of additional costly regulations. "
"14469300","14474840"," However, B of A notes that, quote, higher losses tied to commercial real estate, CRE office"
"14474840","14481560"," exposure, increase in criticized loans tied to multifamily CRE are a reminder of ongoing credit"
"14481560","14485440"," normalization that we are likely to witness across the industry."
"14485720","14490540"," And of course, yesterday's FOMC meeting pushing back against the notion that rate cuts were"
"14490540","14494860"," imminent, served as just salt in the wounds for this already battered sector, guys."
"14495540","14499940"," Leslie, what do all of these mean for Basel III regulation and then, of course, these looming"
"14499940","14501080"," higher capital requirements?"
"14501520","14507020"," That's another great question, Courtney, because on one hand, some of these losses are tied to just"
"14507020","14512380"," compliance with some of the stricter regulatory compliance, getting ready for Basel III. "
"14512820","14515760"," But then there's been this kind of notion in the market."
"14516040","14521660"," People are expecting some sort of watering down of the Basel III proposal as it was written, and"
"14521660","14526800"," regulators could turn to what's happened this week and say, look, these are why we need higher"
"14526800","14527520"," capital requirements."
"14527740","14530720"," This is case in point as to why we're doing this. "
"14530920","14536980"," So now there's kind of this question as to, you know, will they hold up New York Community Bank as"
"14536980","14541120"," the canary and the coal mine as to why these stricter regulations need to take place?"
"14541920","14546580"," Or will that argument that, you know, these are really costly regulations and it's creating a lot"
"14546580","14550920"," of turmoil, you know, themselves be the kind of the winning argument."
"14551300","14554640"," So additional uncertainty as well as it pertains to regulation."
"14555140","14557580"," No one likes uncertainty, especially the regional banks right now. "
"14557680","14558480"," Leslie, thank you very much."
"14559080","14559380"," All right."
"14559420","14563580"," Switching gears now to Apple on deck to report first quarter earnings in just a couple of hours"
"14563580","14569100"," among investors' top concerns is iPhone sales in China, where the company is facing regulatory"
"14569100","14573860"," headwinds, Greece competition from domestic brands Huawei among them. "
"14574420","14580100"," Also, its future ambitions in generative AI, which could become a deciding factor in retaking its"
"14580100","14582560"," crown as the most valuable company in the world."
"14582840","14587840"," That title now belongs to Microsoft in part because of its partnership with Open AI."
"14588660","14594240"," And while Apple shares did jump almost 50 percent last year, it was the smallest gainer in the so "
"14594240","14595380","-called Magnificent Seven. "
"14595860","14598000"," So what lies ahead for that company joining us now?"
"14598380","14603900"," Our own Steve Kovac, who is live in Cupertino and here on set has been Wright's head of technology"
"14603900","14605480"," research at Melius Research."
"14606000","14607300"," Steve, let's start with you."
"14607560","14609980"," Fill us in on what we expect to hear from Apple today. "
"14611260","14613240"," Yeah, Tyler, muted expectations."
"14614040","14616340"," At least that's what Wall Street's looking at here."
"14616580","14621960"," They're expecting for Apple to return to top line sales growth of the first time after four"
"14621960","14624840"," quarters in a row of declining sales, but not by much. "
"14625400","14631740"," Revenue expectations for overall, 118 billion dollars, that would represent more or less half a"
"14631740","14634800"," percent of revenue growth, but still growth again."
"14635340","14639640"," But yes, like you said, there are a lot of troubling expectations here."
"14639760","14646180"," I'll note those estimates used to be about 123 billion last fall, and they've been since paired"
"14646180","14651360"," back quite a bit just because of all this troubling data we've been seeing out of China, and just"
"14651360","14652820"," overall smartphone demand. "
"14653320","14654860"," You mentioned new competition."
"14655500","14660920"," Huawei is a big one that seems to be putting a dent in Apple's market share over there in China,"
"14661280","14666000"," and also top analyst Ming Qing Kuo very tied into the supply chains that Apple uses."
"14666380","14671420"," Said Apple is going to ship 15 percent fewer phones this year, potentially. "
"14672100","14677440"," So really important to look at beyond all that is what guidance Apple gives on its earnings call"
"14677440","14679180"," after that initial report comes out."
"14679660","14685080"," 5 p.m. is when that call starts, and we should expect to hear something, some commentary forward"
"14685080","14688220"," looking on the March quarter, a lot of sour commentary around that."
"14688740","14692060"," And of course, Tyler, we are on the eve of the Vision Pro launch. "
"14692060","14698040"," This launch is tomorrow, that $3,500 augmented reality face computer, whatever you want to call it."
"14698260","14703420"," Tim Cook had a big Vanity Fair cover story today where he appeared for the first time."
"14703460","14706000"," We saw a photo of him actually wearing the Vision Pro. "
"14706460","14711000"," So big launch event for Apple starting tomorrow, the first major product in nine years."
"14711180","14714700"," I expect to hear a little bit about that during the earnings report today as well, Tyler."
"14714900","14715520"," Very interesting. "
"14715880","14721080"," Steve, stay with us as we bring in Ben Wright says, Ben, I guess the the immediate concerns for"
"14721080","14725380"," Apple have to do with iPhone sales and demand, perhaps most especially in China."
"14725500","14731740"," But maybe the longer term issue here is how does Apple wear the mantle, don the mantle of an AI"
"14731740","14732240"," company?"
"14733000","14735260"," And how do they make that their narrative?"
"14735520","14740700"," So address both of those questions, if you would first, the iPhone sales issue and second, the AI"
"14740700","14741200"," question."
"14741720","14744580"," Yeah, well, iPhone is the majority of revenue and profit. "
"14744980","14749180"," So it's the engine there and it attaches obviously a huge amount of the services."
"14749620","14751560"," So that's going to be the laser focus."
"14751920","14755100"," The data I've seen is that the fourth quarter is actually not so bad. "
"14755700","14760040"," The big concern is what's happened in the last month in China is deteriorating every week."
"14760060","14761080"," Why do they do the discounts?"
"14761400","14763860"," What are they seeing and what does that implicate for the March?"
"14763880","14766100"," What does not so bad look like sound like?"
"14766280","14770540"," Well, some of the data I've seen in the fourth quarter in China is down just in the single digits,"
"14770540","14773920"," but there's potentially been a deterioration in recent weeks."
"14774320","14776500"," So we got to ask on that on the call and what they're seeing. "
"14776980","14780960"," But there is a chance that things accelerate out of this quarter."
"14781180","14782840"," They have new Macs, they're going to have new iPads."
"14783360","14785360"," Their services business is doing well. "
"14785540","14788680"," They've had some price increases there that cushion the below from the app store changes."
"14789160","14792880"," So if the iPhone can hang in there, they can get back to revenue growth."
"14793380","14795400"," But let's talk about your AI question. "
"14795860","14797480"," Revenue growth is going to be the key."
"14797740","14800620"," If they can grow in the March quarter, stock may catch a bid."
"14801400","14803580"," But and what they say about China. "
"14804060","14807700"," But I think AI is going to be like the third most important thing, what they say, what they're"
"14807700","14808000"," teasing."
"14808320","14810200"," They have an event in June, their developers conference."
"14810760","14812900"," And I think they're going to announce some new AI features. "
"14812960","14819100"," We want to see an updated Siri and we want to see services that people are going to want to"
"14819100","14820020"," use on your iPhone."
"14820680","14822920"," And that could drive an upgrade cycle."
"14823120","14826320"," I'm not so sure that this year is going to be the huge upgrade cycle. "
"14826700","14827880"," But I think next year will be."
"14828100","14830520"," And it reminds me of past cycles like super cycle."
"14830660","14832300"," And that could be driven by AI?"
"14832680","14833920"," Yes, I think yes. "
"14834320","14838180"," Ben, you have a buy rating, but your price target's 222 or about 185."
"14838940","14841460"," So what's going to drive us 222 from here?"
"14841580","14842860"," How do you get that 20% upside?"
"14843520","14850280"," Well, what I think is if we start to re-accelerate on the revenue side, it's warranting of a very"
"14850280","14850820"," high multiple."
"14851280","14854160"," Their services business in gross margins are excellent. "
"14854600","14855640"," They are in rarefied air."
"14856080","14858180"," And those are actually what keep a floor in the stock."
"14858360","14863540"," And if revenue starts to re-accelerate, I think that we could see earnings power touch eight bucks"
"14863540","14867060"," within two years, well within two years, at least earnings power. "
"14867460","14869620"," And that could power us even much higher than my target."
"14870120","14871780"," But I think we got to see this cycle."
"14871980","14873880"," We got to see the iPhones accelerate. "
"14874820","14876240"," And then that's what takes us there."
"14876520","14877420"," All eyes on Apple."
"14877680","14879000"," As usual, thank you, Ben. "
"14879100","14879180"," Right?"
"14879320","14879820"," Yes, thank you."
"14879960","14880460"," And Steve Kovac."
"14880780","14881620"," Stay warm out there, Steve. "
"14881920","14882280"," We'll see you soon."
"14882540","14882800"," All right."
"14882960","14883260"," Thank you, Ben. "
"14883680","14886860"," Our shares of Norfolk Southern hire today on reports of a proxy battle."
"14887200","14890800"," Now the company is responding, and Morgan Brennan is in the newsroom with the details."
"14891160","14891280"," Morgan. "
"14891560","14891920"," Hi, Tyler."
"14892180","14892320"," That's right."
"14892520","14897760"," So an investor group led by Encore Holdings is, Bill has built a large stake in Norfolk Southern"

"14928560","14933700"," First reported by Wall Street Journal, I can confirm the details of that report that Encore has"
"14933700","14935980"," built a roughly $1 billion stake. "
"14936000","14939480"," It's nominated a majority slave directors to Norfolk Southern's board."
"14940060","14945660"," This is a bid to oust CEO Alan Shaw, according to people familiar with the matter."
"14945880","14951660"," We're seeing this because Norfolk Southern has underperformed on certain financial and performance"
"14951660","14957500"," metrics and as such has underperformed in terms of railroad stocks over the past year or so. "
"14957680","14961840"," As you can see right there, though, shares of Norfolk Southern are up seven and a half percent on"

"14987320","14987760"," Stay with us."
"15001420","15002080"," All right."
"15002100","15003140"," We just a couple seconds here. "
"15044050","15045090"," Oh, yeah."
"15047990","15048550"," Okay."
"15048690","15049690"," One quick second here. "
"15055930","15056830"," All right."
"15056970","15060270"," We're going to get ready here in the background."
"15062270","15064490"," So let's take a look at Google here. "
"15065550","15067010"," Just down below really quick."
"15069390","15073130"," Still hasn't been able to get above that daily trigger."
"15073390","15074870"," There is a cross down here. "
"15075710","15077890"," Well, well, first let's do this."
"15078350","15079430"," Let me see if I can get over there."
"15080010","15080790"," Let me get a quick second here. "
"15081870","15083670"," Oh, what do we got going on here?"
"15087770","15090430"," Did I share that screen down there?"
"15092670","15094650"," Give me one quick second here, boys and girls."
"15094850","15095030"," Hold on."
"15124160","15124880"," All right. "
"15125040","15125180"," All right."
"15125340","15125540"," Hold on."
"15125620","15126240"," We're almost there. "
"15131740","15132980"," I just cracked a bear."
"15133340","15134040"," I need a bear."
"15134220","15134680"," It's been a long. "
"15134960","15141380"," I've really been to sleep in like 24 hours and maybe longer, maybe 36 hours or something."
"15142760","15143200"," Okay."
"15144900","15146380"," What do we got going on here?"
"15151110","15151870"," Look at that. "
"15153150","15154250"," What screen is that?"
"15154570","15155770"," Do I have that screen right?"
"15156070","15156790"," Oh, there I am."
"15157030","15157870"," I'm in the picture."
"15158130","15160190"," All right. "
"15160250","15165950"," Let's take a quick look here at some of the charts that are on the bottom of your the main"
"15165950","15167490"," screen that we watch all day long."
"15168930","15169610"," Excuse me here."
"15169730","15170990"," I haven't slept in a couple of days. "
"15170990","15175050"," I've been trying to get this wrapping up a pretty large project."
"15176250","15177250"," So bear with me."
"15178470","15178950"," Okay. "
"15179330","15182170"," So let's go back to Google."
"15184510","15186410"," It's a one minute chart right now in Google."
"15187230","15190730"," We're going to switch over briefly to a request. "
"15190950","15192630"," I think it was Kamala or someone asked about it earlier."
"15194510","15198510"," Now you're seeing a quick peek right here, right?"
"15199690","15203290"," I got to stop this thing from flipping around right now."
"15203470","15203890"," Hopefully that works. "
"15204870","15205630"," There we go."
"15206630","15214770"," So just a big thing to see here on Google would be a big thing on Google here, right?"
"15215090","15217430"," I'm assuming here."
"15217910","15223270"," I'm going to make an ask of myself here, but you have the immediate drop, right?"
"15223450","15225990"," Take money and run on Goog around their earnings. "
"15227090","15230470"," And of course there's going to be a contingent of people."
"15230470","15232030"," We got a little bit of a reversal head of the downside."
"15232110","15236390"," You can see that you got that daily trigger moving to the downside here. "
"15236770","15238290"," And we are below the hourly trigger."
"15238510","15240190"," So as of right now, it's bearish."
"15242750","15246010"," The other thing that I would say about Google here is, yeah, you're looking for the retracement, at"
"15246010","15247310"," least close the gap up to the upside. "
"15247310","15254290"," But just remember that they're likely not going to do that until either Friday or possibly the"
"15254290","15257630"," close today Friday or possibly next week as well."
"15257630","15259750"," You might get that retracement."
"15260430","15262150"," Oftentimes you'll see the murder of options. "
"15262470","15265190"," People trying to get thinking they're going to get make some money back or whatever."
"15265290","15266070"," That's not going to happen."
"15266510","15270870"," Or if they do come back up here, at least those options will be dead on the rival, right?"
"15271330","15274810"," Anything that is like a 150 C or something like that. "
"15275790","15278870"," Likely even if it does kind of money, it'll be at zero, right?"
"15279530","15280930"," So just Google."
"15281230","15284770"," The one thing I want to show you there though that's important is that you're down on your weekly"
"15284770","15285170"," trigger."
"15285330","15285690"," That's good. "
"15286730","15288810"," It's a nice pullback for Google."
"15289950","15290930"," Do I think it'll go back up?"
"15291090","15291170"," Sure."
"15291370","15297250"," But I would like to see it above that 143 and some change there and some kind of reversal. "
"15297870","15300230"," It could turn into a bull cluster here to go to the upside."
"15300830","15303930"," But until that happens, you got no trade as a bull, okay?"
"15304150","15305730"," You got no trade until that happens."
"15306970","15308130"," So you want to be seeing that, right?"
"15308270","15309910"," You want to see that, see that squeeze up here. "
"15310290","15313110"," You can trade inside here if you want, but you want to see it squeeze up there."
"15314350","15318210"," Get above the previous high once you're above the alley trigger and then start to close that."
"15318390","15319930"," You can enter that trade there though. "
"15320390","15323630"," Don't be fucking around in here unless you're holding it for like five minutes or something like"
"15323630","15324090"," that, okay?"
"15324990","15325770"," On Google."
"15326330","15327990"," Man, I look really tired right now."
"15329090","15330230"," I'm going to not look good. "
"15332570","15332970"," Okay."
"15334270","15335350"," Now, but anyways, that's Google."
"15335730","15337610"," That's a one minute chart on Google right now. "
"15337710","15340310"," We'll take a peek one more time on the 30 minute on this chart as well."
"15342150","15343650"," And there is a problem here."
"15344010","15349430"," There is actually a problem here and that is this or at zero value on the daily right now. "
"15350030","15351910"," Let's take a look and see where it catches the bounce."
"15353470","15356770"," Yeah, it actually likes that zero line pretty well right now."
"15356770","15363410"," So I've been doing really well on that zero line on Google on a 30 minute chart. "
"15363630","15365590"," So you might reverse here."
"15366470","15369250"," I'm actually going to give it to Google to get their reverse."
"15370210","15372050"," And I want to talk to you about this right here. "
"15372210","15374910"," So it's a good way to look at Google, right?"
"15376250","15377130"," You try it up."
"15378230","15378730"," Excuse me."
"15379510","15382550"," Now you try to buy talking about averages here, right?"
"15382710","15385610"," It's always averages probability statistics always. "
"15387150","15392590"," And when do you put the risk on that kind of stuff?"
"15393670","15396670"," So let's say you're like doing zero dates down here, some shit or weekly."
"15397150","15397590"," You get smoked."
"15397810","15398930"," You get smoked again, right?"
"15399690","15401210"," Get smoked again, believe it or not. "
"15401430","15403270"," Like one, two, three, four, five loser."
"15404230","15405230"," Basically what it is, right?"
"15406130","15408930"," I don't put a spread on over here and you panic sell down here."
"15409050","15410150"," You know, it's all that stuff, right?"
"15411230","15412010"," Just garbage. "
"15413070","15417370"," A lot of your best trades though are up here, right?"
"15418250","15419630"," Yeah, you're making money, woo hoo."
"15421010","15425170"," Or you at least wait for the you could like, this is a good day trade right here."
"15425930","15427110"," But it's not sustainable. "
"15427690","15431090"," You already know it's not sustainable because it's come back down and check that trend is higher."
"15431450","15433010"," This is actually the best trade right here."
"15433910","15439010"," The moment it crosses back up again, this is that this is like the best part of that trade. "
"15439190","15443790"," But there's a process to get there for that trade to be successful."
"15444090","15449490"," And a lot of times it'll blood down on you and you're trying to always take like the best, the"
"15449490","15451210"," most choice trades, right?"
"15452550","15461110"," So something similar to that, if this was going to reverse, you know, you can ride the lightning"
"15461110","15462750"," here above 143."
"15463630","15467410"," You know, if the lightning comes in and it blasts up and you're like, but yeah, I want to take"
"15467410","15468130"," that, woo hoo. "
"15469210","15472830"," You know, if you're above the daily trade, you're sure you could take that for a quick rip or"
"15472830","15473330"," something like that."
"15473370","15478250"," But you're always looking for that quick bounce down, that consolidation and the beating the"
"15478250","15479910"," previous high that you're just on."
"15480150","15485970"," Okay, I don't care if that high was right here, here, here, wherever that is, that like one, two,"
"15486230","15487110"," three, four, five steps. "
"15487190","15491830"," And then that part of the trade, if you take only that part of the trade, it's outstanding."
"15492090","15492310"," Okay."
"15495690","15497730"," So Google, not quite there yet right now. "
"15499570","15505210"," And, you know, probably I'd be looking for a little bit of a more low, you know, possibly get down"
"15505210","15505390"," here."
"15506010","15508050"," We are selling off the hourly trigger right now."
"15508090","15510230"," Here's your first sell off the hourly trigger right here. "
"15510770","15514030"," So these bears are going to come in and they're going to sell that hourly trigger."
"15515130","15518250"," And they're going to sell it every time until they get stopped out."
"15519650","15520090"," Right?"
"15520350","15522010"," So if they can keep doing this, right?"
"15522310","15522610"," Sell this. "
"15524050","15525270"," Some stops up here."
"15526430","15529730"," And even if they get stopped out, there's that squeeze we're talking about, right?"
"15529890","15530930"," It's still going to come back down."
"15530930","15538030"," And usually let them get out of that trade anyways, not always, but that's their plan at least. "
"15538550","15538770"," Okay."
"15539970","15541630"," So that's a that's good."
"15544230","15545150"," That over there. "
"15546030","15547370"," That over there for you."
"15548270","15550210"," We're going to talk about Apple here."
"15551150","15552130"," We're going to earnings coming out. "
"15552210","15554010"," We talked about this one earlier today, right?"
"15554790","15558470"," And I had said to you, yeah, you can do the ping pong, whatever you want in here."
"15559010","15560630"," But you're not long down here."
"15563470","15564390"," You can't. "
"15564810","15567050"," You got to have price above the hourly trigger."
"15567310","15572870"," You need the cross on the half hour down here, that gray line, right?"
"15573070","15575530"," You need that cross down here to help you out."
"15576210","15577270"," You need the back check on price. "
"15578350","15580870"," Now they've got any are coming up, right?"
"15581490","15585370"," Some of you probably want to take that trade into the close."
"15585670","15587750"," We're going to we're going to discuss this ticker here."
"15588470","15591230"," In relation to spoons or spy in just a moment. "
"15591450","15591650"," Okay."
"15592210","15598510"," And so there's a setup here for nice squeeze higher into their earnings, but there's also a setup"
"15598510","15599510"," to sell that news."
"15600470","15602450"," So are you trading that with Apple?"
"15603730","15605610"," Are you trading it with cues?"
"15606770","15608290"," Are you synthetically trading it?"
"15609270","15615050"," A lot of trade that you can close it for 15 before that shit pulls back in Friday. "
"15615050","15621610"," If it does, they could keep going up on Friday, but you know, fake and profit is fucking nice and"
"15621610","15627490"," winning seven, nine, 10 trades feels really good for when you really fuck up or you do something"
"15627490","15628710"," against your own rules, right?"
"15628890","15629610"," You get torched."
"15630630","15637530"," So I would if you're going to take a lot of trade today, I'd be looking for something you can"
"15637530","15637770"," exit."
"15639150","15644370"," Even if you you missed out another, if you make 300% you missed out on another and plus those"
"15644370","15646090"," options are likely going to be dirt cheap, right?"
"15646270","15649050"," So your risk is low, your potential is high. "
"15649350","15652810"," Now, I don't know when Apple reports their numbers could be later than four."
"15653290","15658050"," So I don't know if this would actually work on Apple off the checkup check before four PM today and"
"15658050","15660390"," see when all these reports actually take place."
"15660390","15661350"," Not the guy just reports. "
"15663210","15668130"," But I see that right now another way to do it to would be to just buy Apple, right?"
"15668430","15675950"," So then you if you're going to take that lot of trade, it's not bad to own Apple anyways, right?"
"15676070","15677810"," Is it, is it ever bad to own Apple?"
"15678390","15680590"," Not really, but I guess it can be."
"15682590","15684010"," Anyway, you got Apple here."
"15684370","15687530"," There's a, I'm going to show you the spy set up for like a rip into the clothes and then"
"15687530","15689890"," the sell before you wake up tomorrow morning, if possible. "
"15692250","15693750"," Anyways, we'll do that in just a minute."
"15693930","15695970"," So this is Apple 30 minute chart."
"15696950","15698730"," Am I bullish on Apple in the clothes?"
"15698950","15699790"," Of course, fucking Apple. "
"15700490","15704910"," But if they sell, Apple doesn't keep going up if nothing special gets announced."
"15705730","15708410"," I don't want to hear about their headset and all that other bullshit."
"15710070","15714290"," You know, Apple, I've traded Apple, I've traded Apple all I fucking traded up for years. "
"15714850","15716310"," He needs shit like stock split."
"15716910","15717470"," We do."
"15718190","15721210"," And the reason B is that IV crush that comes in no matter what. "
"15723010","15727930"," So I traded a split, I traded an ER with a split announcements on Apple, right?"
"15728810","15731210"," With that split, I made decent money."
"15731390","15734130"," I got trapped and then I made decent money on the overnight."
"15734510","15736870"," I got trapped and had to hold was up. "
"15737070","15739870"," I know I took the trade like six weeks before something."
"15740450","15744970"," I think I was, I needed, I needed the event to trigger money or to make money."
"15745110","15747190"," I think it was up 40% that I was down like there. "
"15747310","15751090"," I dropping two dollars a barrel now."
"15751450","15753270"," You guys can't hear that financial juice, can you?"
"15754090","15755610"," I find out why that is."
"15757550","15765070"," Okay, so the idea here would be even into that ER, I came out of it, I think up to"
"15765070","15767130"," maybe 100 or 300% or something. "
"15768530","15777390"," And when I when the market opened, I closed immediately half my shit made I think 30 or 60k or"
"15777390","15779510"," something left another half on."
"15780410","15785550"," I watched all that money on the other half go right back to fucking zero."
"15785550","15787670"," I didn't lose any money, but I hadn't made any. "
"15788070","15789990"," But I bought the calls for it."
"15790070","15797350"," It took kicking in a whole other round of buyers to then make bank over like two or three weeks"
"15797350","15798190"," or something was insane."
"15798190","15799230"," Made a bunch of money. "
"15799690","15801570"," So just be aware of that on Apple as well."
"15801730","15805670"," There's some other better ways to trade it and better ways to get out better ways before the IV,"
"15806350","15808690"," crushing all that kind of stuff like a synthetic trade."
"15809450","15811390"," Okay, so there's Apple. "
"15811570","15813170"," This is a 30 minute chart on Apple."
"15813930","15815230"," It's a nice little reverse kit."
"15815290","15817550"," Everything's set up looking pretty, pretty good here in Apple. "
"15818410","15822710"," 30 minute chart right in Apple down there parked on their weekly trigger."
"15824210","15825410"," I'll tell you this too."
"15825730","15827130"," Apple's parked on its weekly trigger. "
"15827950","15831250"," It's got a big giant 30 minute reversal candle here."
"15831330","15831690"," That's demand."
"15832910","15840070"," And we'll talk about looking for selling calls into dealers when I get rid of calls into you into"
"15840070","15844830"," Friday and then after the close today, they want you to hold these fucking calls even if the price"
"15844830","15845310"," goes up. "
"15846130","15847910"," They need a bag holder to you."
"15848350","15848710"," You understand?"
"15851370","15853790"," So I would synthetically trade this and get out."
"15854770","15858070"," All right, even if it goes up, even if I'm wrong tomorrow, it doesn't matter. "
"15858590","15864030"," You keep those tools and the reason you say this is because and you say you say I keep these"
"15864030","15869690"," tools because when you back test the shit and you look at your trader log, you're like, oh, I was"
"15869690","15872370"," fucking wrong more times than I was right on those trades."
"15872790","15875270"," I was more right than I was wrong on these other trades."
"15876730","15879710"," Okay, there's Apple 30 minute chart Tesla. "
"15881150","15882270"," We already went over this one."
"15882290","15883150"," I'm not going to do it again."
"15883990","15886530"," I spent like an hour on Tesla earlier today. "
"15886530","15887330"," I'm not doing it."
"15888950","15890790"," You guys know my jam on Tesla."
"15891010","15893430"," You're going to say, oh, this is all consolidating all that kind of stuff. "
"15893930","15897350"," There is a looming fuck show above on Tesla."
"15898990","15901510"," This happened just two weeks ago again, they had a drop."
"15902250","15905890"," I said, oh, if we're going to if we go up there and test that 232, I'd really like to"
"15905890","15907390"," see that close the gap. "
"15907410","15909090"," Then we rolled down in a major way."
"15909230","15910150"," Bad news to come."
"15910270","15910810"," Sure enough. "
"15911570","15913890"," Uh, Tesla, they tricked you."
"15914470","15914790"," Right?"
"15915130","15915150"," Boom."
"15915950","15917290"," They tricked you the last time, right?"
"15917510","15919330"," They're told you're going to close the gap, right?"
"15919510","15920310"," They didn't do any of that shit. "
"15920430","15921570"," They just rolled back down again."
"15922310","15924250"," So Tesla, you know my deal here."
"15924310","15926730"," I want to see if I want to see us get above this bullshit here. "
"15926850","15931210"," This is gnarly back test that successfully then get above it and start trading that again."
"15932310","15936730"," Normally I would under normal circumstances, I would have bought that fucking dip because it's on"
"15936730","15941710"," its perfect daily bottom fellow, but I already showed you guys and I already showed you this stuff"
"15941710","15942070"," up here."
"15942130","15944070"," This is looming on Tesla. "
"15945230","15949430"," Um, when I explained how to buy it and go if it does roll down on you, what's going to"
"15949430","15949750"," happen?"
"15951290","15953790"," Puse looking like it wants to go crazy, right?"
"15954450","15955250"," Very similar, right?"
"15955330","15957990"," Close all this gaps, stuff upstairs up here."
"15958570","15961810"," I'm sure you guys are drawing megaphones on spy and stuff."
"15962590","15964590"," Uh, we'll talk about the spot this in spy. "
"15964870","15966030"," It's the same setup as spy."
"15966150","15967230"," So no, no difference here."
"15968070","15969950"," Uh, one minute trigger here. "
"15970310","15972090"," We got test Tesla."
"15972290","15973970"," We're, I did not write Tesla on this."
"15974570","15975050"," Oh, there you go. "
"15975130","15975910"," There's Tesla right there."
"15976050","15976990"," Tesla 30 minute chart."
"15976990","15978850"," Right there. "
"15979210","15980910"," There's your lumen doom and right there."
"15981110","15983130"," And then you got a SPX over here."
"15983610","15986110"," We know that if you're a bull, this is where you buy the dip. "
"15987070","15992190"," Uh, Intel it fails for some other stuff is showing and not that stuff is showing right now."
"15992930","15993670"," CTA is along."
"15993950","15998530"," They're holding this market up until at least big tech reports, right?"
"15999590","16004870"," Um, once that IV crush happens, I would be thinking about where does that money go?"
"16006050","16006470"," Excuse me. "
"16006790","16008470"," So you got the mag seven and all that stuff."
"16008550","16012670"," You got stuff, some mag seven, but a lot of that money is going to rotate elsewhere."
"16012970","16014650"," So we'll take a look at that at some point as well. "
"16015890","16021010"," So currently right now, uh, SPX, I'm sure you guys are out there going."
"16021110","16021970"," It's going to go to Tesla bro."
"16022630","16024750"," Uh, but I'm sure it's going to go to some more earnings and stuff. "
"16024890","16026870"," So just, just keep an eye on this stuff over here."
"16026870","16029050"," I know you guys want to see this gap that closes up here in the close."
"16029050","16030490"," The setup is there. "
"16030730","16035190"," There's also some kind of a, it's also some kind of like triangle here, right?"
"16035390","16037630"," Well, I don't hate, can't stand."
"16038750","16043130"," Uh, traditional chart and shit, like stupid shit like that."
"16045150","16048050"," But it's there and there's a gap close. "
"16049110","16053550"," And I'm sure all of you right now are going, oh, I'm going to fucking trade the fuck out of"
"16053550","16054090"," this in the close."
"16054550","16056390"," You got a little resistance here, though, don't you?"
"16056450","16060990"," You got a trap here on gamma where you're going to, you're going to get all giddy, giddy, giddy."
"16061650","16065130"," And then they blast you down in the close, possibly in a bad report or take the money and run"
"16065130","16069610"," or whatever or the reports are later in the day and you get rolled down here in the close on,"
"16069610","16071070"," on SPY or ES. "
"16071510","16076650"," So if you're going to trade this, this, uh, this tease here for you, right?"
"16077590","16081650"," The, the idea would be buy apple or something or buy some calls and apple, some stupid shit like"
"16081650","16081870"," that."
"16082290","16088770"," So, uh, what I would say to you would be, uh, you can see where this, uh, cell was back"
"16088770","16089290"," here, right?"
"16089410","16091070"," This was at 1230 in the afternoon."
"16092150","16102070"," Uh, this was where this was, you know, somewhere around, uh, 488 or whatever on SPY. "
"16102950","16106130"," You want to be, uh, like above there."
"16110290","16116150"," You get something like, uh, in the money or deep in the money, uh, that there's still some sauce on"
"16116750","16122470"," and, uh, have the trigger for your right finger ready to slam the buy button on some kind of, uh,"
"16122850","16127030"," some kind of a squeeze up back, back check and then slam up here to close this stuff up."
"16127370","16130030"," You might also have some, some kind of noise like that going on. "
"16131010","16136350"," Uh, but once you close that gap, pull, pull it back one time and it's kind of violent."
"16137750","16139690"," That might actually be your dip buy right there."
"16141050","16142830"," Close that back, gap back down there. "
"16143070","16145210"," Probably a bear in here saying, oh, no, no more do that."
"16145290","16146410"," We're going to roll it down anyways, Cap."
"16147370","16149010"," I would just be aware of this right here. "
"16149070","16149950"," There's 92 million."
"16150190","16153530"," It's sitting currently at a 4900 on SPX."
"16154070","16157430"," You can do a comparison chart and find out where that is on your own. "
"16159130","16161310"," Okay, so I think I got all of these done right now."
"16162150","16163710"," Let's start that bad boy back up."
"16164010","16165490"," Go back to the main screen right here. "
"16166750","16168390"," And, uh, let's take a quick peek."
"16168730","16170890"," Let's see if you can take a quick peek at the trigger chart."
"16171510","16172910"," I got to put my stuff back up here. "
"16173370","16175890"," Check that bread that, uh, it was like a color book."
"16176150","16176970"," Get rid of that thing."
"16177210","16180030"," Oh, no, where's my camera camera?"
"16182130","16183070"," Color block. "
"16183350","16184530"," Get rid of that stuff right there."
"16185590","16188050"," Put that thing right over there."
"16189070","16192210"," And, uh, right there. "
"16192330","16197750"," Hopefully, by the way, I asked, um, I asked a friend to come on to YouTube."
"16197750","16199130"," I think I made him."
"16199310","16200770"," I asked Mero to come here today. "
"16201350","16203230"," I don't know if he's in YouTube stream or not."
"16203730","16205210"," If Mero's here, what up brother?"
"16205510","16207030"," If you can't, oh, he's here."
"16207910","16209270"," Fuck yeah, heads up out there. "
"16209850","16211150"," Mero is in the house right now."
"16211290","16212150"," He just, he made a comment."
"16212470","16213390"," So Mero is here. "
"16214170","16215510"," Well, he's in the YouTube chat."
"16216210","16217870"," He is a long time friend of the show."
"16218530","16219410"," I really love him. "
"16219450","16221430"," He's got a great handle on Fin Twit."
"16221690","16228790"," If you're on Twitch, I always recommend, uh, that you, uh, try to get on YouTube sometimes, even if"
"16228790","16232810"," you're on Twitch, chat with Mero or find him on Twitter."
"16233370","16235030"," He is a market professional. "
"16236110","16238250"," He does something similar to what we do."
"16238890","16245870"," And he comes into the stream whenever he has time and tries to answer questions and talk to retail"
"16245870","16246350"," traders."
"16246690","16251550"," He's taken a shine, uh, to dumbasses, to dumb retail. "
"16252590","16254530"," Uh, so please listen to him."
"16254570","16255490"," He likes to shit post a lot."
"16255650","16260190"," So you got to cut through all the shit posts and stuff, but that guy's got real tools. "
"16260190","16267250"," That guy's got shit that professionals use in their real life, uh, to trade this market day in, day"
"16267250","16267490"," out."
"16267670","16268910"," They got college, they got college."
"16269810","16270570"," They think they're a badass. "
"16270570","16274470"," They go through the meat grinder and this is how they make their living."
"16274770","16277790"," These guys live and die by their swords here doing that stuff."
"16277890","16279250"," So give any questions for him. "
"16279810","16281650"," Uh, he will have me pull up charts."
"16281650","16284090"," If you have some time, maybe we'll do that today if he wants to."
"16284170","16285530"," If he doesn't want to just hang out. "
"16285890","16287470"," Mero, I appreciate your being here, brother."
"16287470","16288290"," I always love you, man."
"16288730","16291510"," And, uh, so he's in the chat right now in YouTube. "
"16291570","16293650"," If you have any questions, don't ask him stupid shit."
"16293830","16296110"," Like where's Google go and ask him something important."
"16296110","16303130"," Like, uh, do you have any tips or, uh, ideas on how to day trade or if you're, if you're"
"16303130","16307410"," interested in day trading, globe X trading, futures trading, any of that stuff, do you recommend"
"16307410","16308310"," going to a combine?"
"16308530","16312170"," Do you recommend going to a prop trading firm, anything or associate with that kind of stuff?"
"16312570","16314050"," He's the, he's one of the guys you ask. "
"16314050","16314650"," He's a badass."
"16315490","16316970"," Um, so he's here right now."
"16317030","16318230"," Mero, I appreciate you being here, brother. "
"16320750","16321970"," I appreciate you, man."
"16322450","16323950"," Uh, so he's in the chat right now."
"16323970","16326610"," So if you want to reach out to him, say hello, uh, please do it. "
"16327790","16330570"," So we got, uh, Tesla, here's spoons right here, right?"
"16330810","16332950"," So we know that this is where they're selling at, right?"
"16333070","16334410"," We know this is where the gap is above."
"16334690","16337790"," We're going to look at that gap really quick, uh, into this close."
"16338430","16340990"," We're going to snap a line here on the close really quick. "
"16343770","16347090"," Take a peek in the 30 minute on spoons really quick and see if it can even go up there."
"16347610","16348970"," Where the fuck is my camera?"
"16349610","16350110"," There you go."
"16350230","16350970"," Camera frame camera. "
"16352070","16352530"," Where's that?"
"16352770","16353190"," There we go."
"16353310","16357350"," Move that shot out of the way to put these people up here so they can see all their sauce"
"16357350","16358310"," going on over there."
"16359430","16365330"," And, uh, first thing we're going to check here, I always like, yeah, I always love, I always love,"
"16365330","16373130"," uh, daily are the daily chart or excuse me, the half hour chart velocity is where I want to know. "
"16373370","16376290"," Like, like, we're going to, we're going to have some support here going up or not."
"16376510","16378770"," And we're at zero line right now, just curling around."
"16379070","16381450"," We talked about this earlier today, right?"
"16381610","16386630"," I said, yeah, we're about to bottom out here on an intraday basis on the hourly bellow and the half"
"16386630","16388290"," hour of bellow and the 15 bellow. "
"16388750","16390090"," Uh, we're looking for this now."
"16390470","16393210"," We're looking for this part."
"16393750","16394210"," See it?"
"16396430","16401369"," Get these little, get these nice little dips down here, nice little dips. "
"16401470","16402970"," You're looking for that moment right there."
"16403090","16403529"," That's that rip."
"16403869","16405070"," That's that rip right there. "
"16405150","16407689"," We just came back up and you're looking for that one more time, right?"
"16407869","16409110"," Do it again, do it again, do it again."
"16409630","16411890"," Uh, we all see the setup."
"16412070","16413570"," I know I can, I don't, I can tell it. "
"16413630","16417930"," All you guys can see that stuff and you're all looking for that face repper into the clothes."
"16418230","16420470"," Now, if it doesn't come, it might come tomorrow."
"16421470","16422910"," We get some battery ports though. "
"16423009","16423590"," You're fucked, right?"
"16423689","16424250"," We're going downtown."
"16425630","16426529"," Big time, right?"
"16426650","16431290"," We're going to get out and trade, uh, 78 down there right down here."
"16431290","16436509"," One of trading that down below and maybe even a little more dipage down below here, such up for a"
"16436509","16437349"," bloodbath in a Friday. "
"16437770","16443710"," You get underneath here, battery ports get underneath them and we'll start making our way down to"
"16443710","16443990"," the weekly."
"16444669","16445910"," I hope it's not a hundred points lower."
"16446250","16450430"," So that is way down here at four, currently at four 52. "
"16451669","16460430"," So, uh, target to the downside, 45 by next week, maybe fourth, four 60, 45, uh, next week on spoons"
"16460430","16461029"," or spy."
"16462130","16465390"," This is the setup that what I do wrong here."
"16466689","16467529"," I'm dang it. "
"16467869","16470610"," Oh, no, I messed it all up."
"16470830","16471529"," Hold on a second here."
"16476640","16477980"," Let's try that again. "
"16485080","16490240"," Visible order, brings front, uh, visible intervals, current, and we'll move to just some paint"
"16490240","16490480"," above."
"16490900","16492020"," Let's try that again one more time."
"16492919","16496000"," So, that was a 30 minute chart. "
"16496320","16499520"," Everything looks good for the bulls here in a 30 minute basis, at least."
"16500220","16501300"," Now we do have reports."
"16501740","16503400"," So, you know, how reports go, right?"
"16504300","16509259"," Velocity can, I mean, velocity is just a rug pull waiting to happen on, on big events, whether it's"
"16509259","16512320"," the Fed, whether it's earnings, all that kind of stuff. "
"16513360","16516599"," Also note that a lot of these big tech companies are ending here this week, right?"
"16516720","16519279"," So we're going to start getting some crush around."
"16519560","16520960"," I want you to be aware of that too."
"16521020","16526759"," If you're in any kind of like non spreads, that kind of stuff, you're going to get all kinds of"
"16526759","16531900"," crush heading over the weekend on any of your permissions or positions, right?"
"16532000","16535980"," People are going to exit in mass and take their money and run. "
"16536060","16537860"," You've seen that already happen on good reports."
"16539820","16541520"," And let's look one more time over here, right?"
"16541619","16543840"," We're trying to close this kind of garbage over here."
"16543919","16545240"," We already did that one, basically. "
"16545980","16549380"," We got one more little one right here, one more little one right here that we come straight up"
"16549380","16549540"," here."
"16549700","16553759"," I guess you could put another yellow one right there if you want to do one to get really like"
"16553759","16554640"," crank here or whatever."
"16554860","16555820"," You could do something like that. "
"16556419","16556759"," Okay."
"16557400","16559380"," And you already know for sure."
"16559759","16561300"," You know for sure a few things, right?"
"16562000","16564140"," You got the, what do we call around here?"
"16564240","16566140"," Young Jim Bros are down here, right?"
"16567160","16568960"," Young sellers down here, right?"
"16569099","16570140"," They haven't hit leg day. "
"16570220","16571060"," They're not like Mero."
"16571300","16571880"," Mero's up here."
"16572500","16573919"," Mero's like a gangster up here. "
"16574080","16575820"," He's an old weight lifter."
"16576140","16578400"," He works out his legs, his back, his arms."
"16578640","16580779"," He's standing up here to sell. "
"16581660","16583160"," He might have come down a little bit."
"16584240","16585619"," All right, we can go up here and fuck around."
"16585779","16591220"," These guys poke the bears, poke the young bears, but you know, this is probably going to get some"
"16591220","16594820"," kind of cell action coming into it, even if we squeeze up there. "
"16595520","16600500"," So upside price target today, if there's good reports 490, possibly tomorrow 490, maybe an"
"16600500","16604580"," extension up to 492, 491, excuse me up here."
"16605419","16608419"," If that does happen, bulls have one good thing coming for them."
"16608680","16614300"," They have a reversal here on the hourly trend, hourly trends turning up, half our trends turning"
"16614300","16614580"," up. "
"16614779","16619640"," That's a two and a half, two and a half cluster, a bull cluster to the upside."
"16619640","16621619"," So everything looks good for bulls here."
"16621900","16624740"," But again, we still have reports that kind of stuff. "
"16625040","16629279"," Maybe zero dates, maybe a Friday call to be a little more safe."
"16630140","16634619"," And if you need to cut it loose at 415 because shit gets wild, you pull out."
"16635200","16635560"," Make sense?"
"16635939","16642720"," Or you take zero dates, set up two trades, set up zero dates for the run up, take the money"
"16642720","16643060"," and run. "
"16643820","16649020"," And if you want to buy some one dates for tomorrow at 415 or something, so you're able to maximize,"
"16649640","16653180"," you're minimizing your risk on zero dates, right?"
"16653400","16658560"," If they burn, you get to capture a huge upside gain, right?"
"16659640","16660580"," No intrinsic value."
"16661000","16662880"," Looking for a big crank, three, four, 500%."
"16662880","16664419"," Take the money and run. "
"16665500","16671480"," And then you jump back in later to get one dates for tomorrow if you think that would continuation"
"16671480","16673800"," into tomorrow."
"16674080","16675580"," Another last point here would be this."
"16676099","16679439"," As we come into that four o'clock hour, they play the funny business, right?"
"16680860","16684180"," You need to think all this stuff out when you're taking these trades in advance. "
"16684660","16685700"," Where do I want to put my risk?"
"16685900","16687400"," Where do I want to take the profit?"
"16687779","16690840"," If we're going to get zero dates, I'm going to try to take the money and run."
"16691220","16697480"," Am I getting them now at three p.m.? If we have power, if they burn, what happens, right?"
"16697860","16699919"," So do I get like super in the money stuff right now?"
"16699919","16700419"," Probably not."
"16700919","16704520"," Probably right if I was going to take some right now, probably like 10 cents, something like that. "
"16705259","16707860"," I don't want to lose a dollar right now, right?"
"16708099","16712380"," If they burn, no big deal, I can go back in again at three p.m., I can go back"
"16712380","16715560"," in again at four or one if they bloodbath us down, right?"
"16716099","16719540"," So they pin us in here, some shit like that, 10 cent calls burn."
"16720140","16723140"," They start whittling down everything that's in the money, right?"
"16723540","16725080"," Get into that four p.m. hour."
"16726119","16727820"," And right before that, right?"
"16728020","16728759"," They blood you, right?"
"16729020","16733160"," Everybody exits Apple and whatever else is reporting today, I believe Amazon or whatever, but to"
"16733160","16734060"," blow all this shit down. "
"16734300","16739939"," And then you, the real true dip buy was like 359 or 401 p.m. And you ride that shit"
"16739939","16744380"," all the way up, and you make three, four, five hundred percent, you're able to take two, 10 cent"
"16744380","16749020"," trades, run it up for four, five hundred percent, you exit, take the money, especially, and think"
"16749020","16754419"," about this as you're doing these trades, you're trying to also time when you get out."
"16754759","16758759"," You don't need all of it about some 10 cents and willing to take 30 cents."
"16759000","16760860"," Oh shit, it went to 70 cents and then capture it all. "
"16761279","16762300"," Who the fuck do you care?"
"16762439","16765380"," You take the money and you run pocket that money and move on to the next trade."
"16765919","16766320"," Make sense?"
"16766779","16772259"," Set, get set up for continuation, let's say at four 15, where you can jump into a one date if"
"16772259","16776640"," you really want to put some money money down on a on a gap up in the overnight and tomorrow."
"16777440","16779600"," Some of you guys are probably not following all that, are you?"
"16780060","16782260"," Stick around long enough and you'll understand it over time. "
"16782260","16786100"," And you'll be like, yeah, I got that, I got that, I got this, I do that all the time"
"16786100","16786920"," kind of stuff, okay?"
"16787840","16790060"," So that's spoos right now for this close."
"16790380","16791560"," Now, let's look at something here."
"16792280","16794400"," We're going to draw a vertical line here. "
"16802780","16803800"," Sixteen hundred, okay?"
"16803920","16806000"," This is the close right now, right?"
"16807620","16810260"," You've got, we're going to want to try it out."
"16811040","16813180"," So you got all this kind of garbage up here, right?"
"16813360","16816980"," They sell you down maybe before we get at four p.m. Right?"
"16817200","16821120"," All the Apple people are exiting and then, man, you get that one last slam up to the top here."
"16821280","16822860"," So start thinking about that too, right?"
"16823520","16824560"," Say it down, you get the blood bath. "
"16825800","16827180"," Best dip buy right there."
"16828560","16829780"," If that can't happen, right?"
"16829920","16830860"," Ten cents, ten cents."
"16832420","16836140"," If you're bullish, if you're bullish into this close. "
"16840180","16842260"," No, I want to talk to you guys about that."
"16843200","16844800"," I want to warn you guys of something, okay?"
"16845520","16848200"," Never, ever run that gamma."
"16848740","16849700"," Good question, by the way. "
"16850080","16853640"," Never, ever run a gamma data all throughout the day."
"16854240","16857440"," You can separate the zero date stuff."
"16858720","16862380"," You can separate the zero date stuff from what comes out at nine thirty in the morning. "
"16863100","16866720"," There's a problem though, that the data gets fucked up throughout the day."
"16867040","16875020"," It gets even worse as we get into like four, five, six p.m. You're like true market gamma is"
"16875020","16877780"," cleanest in the morning, cleanest."
"16878320","16882880"," Now, if you wanted to separate or if you wanted to do like a ratio of some kind to find"
"16882880","16886700"," out the difference to find out what what kind of gamma is coming in the market. "
"16886960","16888480"," And I've got some stuff coming to you guys."
"16889020","16894700"," And this week, as we as we launched, I think I've got a way for you guys to see calls"
"16894700","16897500"," and puts being bought and sold throughout the day."
"16897600","16899960"," We can have a more extended conversation on this. "
"16900340","16901740"," There's a service out there."
"16902000","16910400"," Last year, three, I think, three flow services are being sued right now by institutions."
"16911460","16913920"," It was a very low key story that came out last year. "
"16914620","16919740"," And because they know that a couple of flow services actually know what's coming in and out of the"
"16919740","16920000"," market."
"16920400","16923220"," One of them, I believe can't prove it, but I think it's flow."
"16923220","16923660"," I'll go. "
"16924380","16926360"," You can always contact them."
"16926700","16929580"," Now, I don't have any association with those guys, but I used to pay for them."
"16930000","16938260"," And I think they gave me a way to like test it for a month or something. "
"16938620","16946160"," They had a whole whole, whole like educational thing where they were able to assign numbers to the"
"16946160","16951440"," money coming in out of the market and all the lit non lit markets and across the world and assign"
"16951440","16953880"," if who who was who's buying and selling."
"16954380","16958940"," And sure enough, I didn't name the companies that are doing it, but I believe they're one of them."
"16959380","16960560"," So check those guys out. "
"16960720","16961140"," Flow, I'll go."
"16962280","16965560"," Tom Cap and Jim James said, you've got no affiliate with them status."
"16966000","16966700"," I like those guys. "
"16967400","16968540"," However, they're doing their stuff."
"16968740","16971580"," They're probably the best company I've ever seen."
"16971880","16973500"," And I think they're being sued for right now. "
"16974040","16979020"," I can't, that's allegedly, and no one's ever said that they're being sued or sued or brought to"
"16979020","16979460"," court or whatever."
"16979620","16984080"," But I believe that they are one of the badass flow services out there for that."
"16988380","16989480"," Okay, what else?"
"16990620","16991700"," Okay, so what else here?"
"16993280","16994620"," Hold on one second again. "
"16994760","16999380"," Nice little squeeze going on an apple in the close again, bullish in the close here on apple."
"17002820","17006480"," See if I can get on over here."
"17006660","17007520"," Hold on one second. "
"17008620","17010600"," It's the main screen right here."
"17014440","17015700"," I think this is a trap."
"17015960","17017000"," I think they're going to trap you. "
"17017220","17018040"," I'll be honest with you."
"17019340","17021100"," So this is the close."
"17021280","17022600"," We're going to make this red, I guess. "
"17024680","17025080"," Bam."
"17025080","17026320"," It will make it a little bit thicker."
"17027380","17028360"," Yeah, nice and thick. "
"17029080","17037040"," We'll do the power hour here at a 3 p.m. And we'll make that yellow."
"17038780","17039180"," Okay."
"17042500","17043900"," Nice little squeeze going on. "
"17045580","17050300"," I personally would like to see something like, you know, just like that or not like that, I have to"
"17050300","17050840"," slide it over."
"17051760","17054700"," I personally like to see the squeeze up in the three o'clock, right?"
"17054880","17056920"," You get pinned in here."
"17057560","17061020"," They dump you down in a four and then that's where your real move is. "
"17062340","17062980"," Up there."
"17063160","17066640"," So as we come up here and test all this stuff, break off all these yellow bars."
"17067400","17073400"," As we strike those things, we will watch how this plays out into the close here today. "
"17078200","17081040"," Oh, dude, I tweet all kinds of I shit post all day long."
"17081040","17081940"," I love shit posting."
"17083080","17084280"," I'm a fucking mirror. "
"17085160","17091220"," You guys got to be able to, you guys got to be able to, some of you guys are literal"
"17091220","17091820"," out there."
"17092540","17095800"," Some of you guys are like, is he shitposters tell the truth?"
"17096480","17097600"," Like, you guys need to learn."
"17097800","17099880"," If you're a young man out there, I'm going to tell you something. "
"17101500","17108240"," It is a very important life skill to be able to identify what's real, what's not, what's"
"17108240","17113000"," shitposting, what's not so you can navigate life successfully."
"17115700","17116100"," Absolutely."

"17138760","17141900"," You're going to try to make your living and your career in this job, right?"
"17143020","17146300"," When you're a young trade, I'll say, I'll be able to rephrase it or go back a little bit. "

"17353480","17353660"," Bam."

"17365760","17367040"," Did I put the other one in there?"
"17367180","17368140"," Or did I say fuck that?"
"17368440","17369660"," There's one more back here."
"17370120","17371000"," There's one more right."
"17371200","17371820"," Oh, god damn it. "
"17372620","17376940"," He's fucking like, you know, there's like some smart, smart guy out there's like, well, what about"
"17376940","17377660"," that one right there?"
"17377760","17378860"," Cup probably gonna sell that one."
"17380880","17381960"," This one right here."
"17384080","17385420"," We'll snap that one in there too. "
"17387700","17388680"," Time we're fucking done."
"17388800","17390560"," We'll have like, fucking 80 bars up here."
"17391800","17392340"," All right. "
"17392400","17392540"," Hold on."
"17392620","17393020"," Get rid of that."
"17395900","17396700"," I'm saucy. "
"17396800","17398180"," I haven't slept in 36 hours."
"17399580","17401540"," I got very saucy right now."
"17402240","17402860"," See what's going on. "
"17403060","17405600"," Dude, that red is turning that, that yellow orange."
"17406540","17407960"," What do we get so orange before?"
"17410080","17411600"," Let's see what's going on over here."
"17411760","17413160"," We're going to make this a little bit smaller here. "
"17413360","17414280"," Now that we're getting close."
"17415560","17417080"," Got nine minutes left for the bulls."
"17417320","17423320"," Remember where the stock market also works on a, on the, on the, on the year, on the quarter, on"
"17423320","17430780"," the month, on the week, on the day, on the hour, on the half hour, on the 15 minute, right?"
"17431700","17435340"," Stock market's on the, not on the zero hour, are they?"
"17435340","17438820"," It's nine 30, 10 30, 11 30, right?"
"17439060","17441880"," So right now we're coming into a half hour period where bulls need to get a new high. "
"17442180","17442640"," They did."
"17443100","17444560"," Let's look back on this time right here."
"17446120","17446520"," Right. "
"17446800","17447460"," Right in here."
"17447640","17448680"," What time was that right there?"
"17448920","17449860"," 1 p.m. See it?"
"17450540","17452780"," 1 p.m. Right."
"17453520","17456560"," Failed right here to get a new high at 130. "
"17457920","17460120"," But got a new high over here at two o'clock."
"17460940","17463680"," Bulls turn it up one more time right now coming in the three o'clock hour."
"17463680","17464780"," It's pretty bullish here. "
"17465880","17467060"," We'll see if they can do it."
"17467180","17467940"," They get that new high."
"17468080","17469160"," That's all they have to do. "
"17469740","17474300"," They can go back here and back, check that five minute trigger and that R1, something like that."
"17475200","17476840"," We got a cross coming up here too."
"17477020","17478300"," We've got the half hour crossing. "
"17478580","17483600"," The hour would not be shocked to see something where you see that squeeze, boom, squeeze it up."
"17484260","17486520"," Then you come back down when this cross happens."
"17487560","17490800"," Just check that cross and then bam, we're up into the close right there. "
"17491320","17494120"," So just keep your eye on that cross right there."
"17496540","17498960"," These tend to elicit reactions."
"17499840","17503280"," Sometimes you'll call these things you'll be like, oh, it's a liquidation break. "
"17503780","17506040"," Trying to cut out all your stops before they head up higher."
"17506740","17507280"," Stuff like that."
"17515100","17516060"," What up everybody?"
"17519620","17520860"," Chicken tendies, baby. "
"17521100","17521780"," Mountain do's."
"17523560","17525280"," Live in a mom's basement, baby."
"17525940","17527040"," Live my best life. "
"17528220","17530520"," Mom's boyfriend's leading me alone right now."
"17531160","17533920"," Do you guys remember that time that dude, what did he do?"
"17534300","17534620"," He pissed."
"17534840","17535640"," I actually was there. "
"17535840","17536760"," I was there when it happened."
"17538320","17542340"," Do you guys remember that guy, uh, remember that guy like pissed at a cop and drank it?"
"17542540","17543400"," He deleted the video."
"17545340","17547480"," But he posted that shit like right away. "
"17547780","17549320"," It was, I think it was the middle of the night too."
"17550480","17552880"," You got any guys old school Wall Street petters in here?"
"17554580","17558100"," There's all kinds of fucking crazy stories from the old school days in Wall Street Bets."
"17559720","17562280"," Oh yeah, he was in his mom's basement, dirty basement. "
"17562960","17565080"," He had a fucking cop pissed into it and drank it."
"17567480","17570320"," He made a bet this before they had bets on Wall Street Bets."
"17570780","17574060"," Oh, not bets, but like the bets that you guys make where they ban you for a week or whatever. "
"17577120","17578040"," That's right, baby."
"17578220","17578680"," Poofer ban."
"17584330","17587530"," Ah, Matthew Met, I just, Matthew Met, I just said fuck what I think. "
"17588010","17591050"," By the way, Matthew Met thanks for supporting the stream and I appreciate it."
"17592050","17595630"," He just said fuck what I sold at 4810, 10 paper hands."
"17596410","17597710"," We were just talking about that. "
"17598350","17598970"," It's okay."
"17598970","17600150"," Take the money and run."
"17600450","17601510"," Get ready for the next trade. "
"17603430","17604710"," What up, Johnny Haggerty?"
"17606270","17607510"," What's going on, baby?"
"17609110","17611150"," William saying, I got my boots smoked today."
"17611210","17613110"," I just knew we were having another bearish day."
"17613310","17616890"," Kept buying puts and by the time I saw your chart, I'm wearing regards to the hourly. "
"17617130","17617550"," It was too late."
"17617790","17618390"," Come blown up."
"17618810","17619750"," That sucks, man. "
"17620790","17623010"," I've had some really nasty trades."
"17624050","17628770"," I've had, so I've been taking, like taking trades, I've got other people playing like, take this"
"17628770","17631010"," trade with me or I'm like, I'll take one with you."
"17631970","17635450"," I've gotten torched and I'm not, I'm not counter trading right now, Will. "
"17636150","17637570"," So I'm busy as fuck."
"17637690","17640710"," So like I'm putting on like put spreads and shit."
"17640830","17643450"," I had some, matter of fact, I recommended two put spreads. "
"17644210","17649590"," And one of those two I put puts on, I didn't follow my own fucking advice."
"17650130","17655010"," Both of those trades printed and I didn't have the time to counter that trade."
"17655010","17659370"," So even if I take a put spread, I will counter that trade all the way up too. "
"17659850","17660930"," And I did not do that."
"17661190","17662450"," So I've been, I got him getting wrecked."
"17663150","17665150"," It's not the only one getting wrecked either. "
"17665770","17669390"," Joe Donut was following me and some of that shit together and he was getting hammered too."
"17672850","17673550"," Yeah, man."
"17673790","17675610"," Will, brother, keep your heads up. "
"17675730","17676390"," Keep your head up, brother."
"17677450","17680130"," Will, we got some, will accumulate some money."
"17680990","17682130"," Just wait till mid March, man. "
"17682390","17683270"," Sit on hands, brother."
"17684250","17685810"," Let's just sit on hands right now."
"17686270","17688090"," We're going to set up a, that's another thing too. "
"17688190","17694250"," We're going to set up a trade for a potential, we're going to set up a trade for a potential,"
"17696330","17698890"," a potential seasonal low."
"17700170","17701830"," And how do you follow that trade?"
"17702410","17703890"," How do you counter trade that trade?"
"17704810","17709250"," If that seasonal low doesn't come, all that kind of stuff, we pop the collar, something like that."
"17709550","17711110"," And we're going to set that trade up here. "
"17712370","17716790"," Before the weekend is, before we get into the weekend, so you guys can make that trade."
"17717050","17721290"," And if you're blowing up your account, if your account is low right now, I would say to you sit"
"17721290","17730870"," on your hands into that March, April time period and wait for a nice fat dip buy in the market,"
"17731010","17732970"," wherever that fat dip buy may be."
"17733150","17737490"," I'm going to tell you guys something out there, okay, on this topic right here. "
"17738450","17742270"," You are going to be told by people there is no yearly seasonal low."
"17743130","17744790"," They're going to tell you that it doesn't come."
"17744990","17749270"," I don't give a fuck if it happens over the course of a week or over the course of two"
"17749270","17749550"," months. "
"17750390","17755870"," You are going to get that moment to buy that dip at least once or twice this year."
"17756830","17760170"," And every crazy bull run, it doesn't matter."
"17760310","17761150"," You're going to get that chance. "
"17761850","17765470"," So if you are at that moment, there will be a capitulation phase."
"17765930","17774490"," You can put on a gorgeous bundle of money, 10, 20, 30k, whatever, get a nice safe, safe, sexy call"
"17774490","17774810"," spread."
"17775390","17778710"," Time that shit out two, three months and just sit on it. "

"17781650","17784250"," You can go out, go gallivant around day trading zero dates."
"17784490","17788970"," You can go out there and fuck around in futures, blowbacks, do whatever the fuck you want, get all"

"17800580","17806260"," God damn will, will send me a fucking DM."
"17809520","17810700"," Send me a DM, man."
"17812620","17813460"," Stop trading. "
"17814700","17816860"," Seriously, just fucking stop."
"17818460","17819420"," Stop trading."

"17864340","17870800"," I saw CNBC earlier today was like, I own Amazon, I own Apple, but I'm more bullish than Apple than"
"17870800","17872640"," Amazon, that kind of stuff."
"17872640","17880280"," This looks like I could get closed here, but then some profit taking your local neighborhood"
"17880280","17888720"," financial advisor, your Charles Schwab guy, he fucking loves Amazon fucking part, big part of their"
"17888720","17889020"," accounts."
"17890260","17893080"," Buy it, sell it, buy it, sell it, buy it, sell it. "
"17894360","17895340"," Oh, it's meta today."
"17895720","17896600"," I'm a bad, wrong one."
"17897280","17898340"," I'm getting the wrong one here. "
"17898500","17898980"," Hold on a second here."
"17899820","17902460"," I was thinking Amazon because they were talking about it."
"17902460","17903760"," I'm CNBC earlier today. "
"17904200","17905360"," Hit the wrong one on my bad."
"17906320","17907300"," There we go, meta."
"17907740","17908340"," Oh, no, that's TA. "
"17908560","17909180"," What the fuck is that?"
"17909540","17909960"," Transalta?"
"17910940","17912920"," Type in all kinds of fucked up shit in here."
"17913740","17914240"," Hold on."
"17915080","17915620"," There's meta. "
"17916960","17917860"," 30 minute chart."
"17920060","17920480"," Cranking."
"17920900","17924920"," I bet, let me ask, let me ask Trader Podcast because he made me some money here. "
"17926040","17928660"," Trader Podcast made me money right here."
"17930040","17931440"," I'm ready to make money right there."
"17932440","17934340"," Trader Podcast made me money on meta. "
"17935760","17936740"," What's going on here?"
"17938420","17940080"," Oh, I got some wonky shit going on."
"17941900","17943660"," Oh, I got some craziness going on here."
"17943760","17944180"," Hold on here. "
"17946800","17948340"," I'm like losing my charts here."
"17948480","17948880"," There we go."
"17949920","17954840"," Coming into that resistance above on SPX Gamma on the 30 minute chart, the one minute chart"
"17954840","17955220"," actually. "
"17959670","17961830"," Where's uh, this Trader Podcast here?"
"17961830","17963550"," He made me some, well, not bank."
"17964190","17965430"," He only had 10 contracts."
"17967530","17968610"," But he made me some money. "
"17970770","17972090"," Spot, what is going on here?"
"17973450","17974610"," Getting some, oh, wait a minute, wait a minute."
"17974710","17975630"," I'm getting all fucked up here."

"17980550","17980970"," Oh, yeah. "
"17981130","17983610"," I'm getting like craziness with this stuff here."
"17987170","17988110"," For this stuff flips."
"17989130","17992970"," Coming into this resistance point right now on SPX, okay?"
"17995670","17996810"," Just the heads up here. "
"17998210","18000810"," That's SPX down below that you're looking at down there."
"18002330","18004350"," Sorry, I'm getting turned around on myself here."
"18005410","18006490"," This is supposed to be meta. "
"18010520","18011040"," Okay."
"18013420","18018340"," Meta is above its, um, pivot right here."
"18019560","18023560"," We need Trader Podcasts to tell us more about meta, I guess. "
"18024400","18025120"," Is he here?"
"18030420","18031840"," Yeah, I agree with that too, Johnny."
"18034650","18036650"," I'm in the wrong fucking charts here, man."
"18036750","18038630"," This thing keeps, this thing's moving too fast for me. "
"18040550","18042570"," Yeah, meta looks like take the money and run too."
"18043810","18045930"," Big meta set up to take the money and run as well."
"18048370","18049370"," Upside target 408. "
"18053420","18055460"," I'm gonna flip over to SPX here."
"18059900","18062380"," This is what I think happens right here down here."
"18067540","18068600"," That's what I think happens. "
"18072860","18074240"," I'll give you a little bit more stretch."
"18076260","18081460"," Actual draw, like I'll draw it on, uh, I'm gonna clean it up a little bit."
"18082860","18083780"," I'll give you this. "
"18086800","18091120"," And some stupid like that, some stupid like that, then like that."
"18091800","18094320"," And then there you go, after the bell."
"18095280","18096200"," Something like that. "
"18100470","18101770"," Let's see how that works."
"18102210","18103010"," Let's see how fucked up."
"18103410","18108670"," I always love drawing this stuff off first and then see it if I'm right or wrong or how long"
"18108670","18109010"," it takes. "
"18109010","18112170"," Sometimes it takes longer than I expect or stuff like that."
"18112430","18113190"," We'll see how this goes."
"18118970","18121530"," I'd probably do something like this right here. "
"18122190","18123370"," Shoot right back down."
"18123550","18128340"," Something like that."
"18134530","18136770"," It rolled like two days later or something like that. "
"18137450","18138750"," There's those are closed as fuck."
"18139490","18142530"," I think I made 40, 50% or something like that."
"18152300","18153340"," Maybe we can get them on them. "
"18153340","18154420"," Let me see if they can find them."
"18154680","18155120"," Hold on."
"18157860","18158900"," Hold on one second here. "
"18161040","18162880"," I'll text them right now to see if I'll come on the show."
"18173970","18174610"," And talk."
"18175950","18178710"," I want to come on the show and talk, uh, ERs for today. "
"18184590","18186670"," Let's see if that autocorrects for me."
"18188310","18189690"," Ooh, look at that juice up there."
"18189810","18192490"," You guys are, you guys, I bet you guys are all just long as fuck, right?"
"18192650","18193430"," Let me look at that up there. "
"18193430","18195910"," It looks like it wants to fucking fuck to the upside."
"18199230","18200070"," Here, just look at that."
"18200350","18201130"," Oh, it's like, look at that. "
"18201190","18202530"," It's just begging for it to go up there, isn't it?"
"18203170","18204670"," It's like, come to me up here, bro."
"18204970","18205730"," There's my stink bid."
"18206570","18210610"," We need, we need, we need, we need price up here so we can sell into it up here up"
"18210610","18210870"," here. "
"18221020","18221660"," Oh, sweet."
"18226150","18226870"," He's coming on."
"18230650","18231290"," Oh, yeah. "
"18231530","18232470"," I think I got something here."
"18232470","18232950"," Hold on."
"18233050","18234470"," I think I might have something here. "
"18236090","18237090"," How do I do this?"
"18238350","18243250"," This is gonna be kind of funky to do because I haven't set up a screen for it."
"18244890","18247250"," Uh, it's gonna look, it's gonna look kind of stupid."
"18250270","18251530"," But we're gonna do it anyways. "
"18253610","18255590"," Shit, I don't know if I can set it up right now."
"18256570","18257370"," Hold on here."
"18258870","18260650"," I mean, I'm gonna set something up for you guys here. "
"18260850","18261250"," Hold on a second."
"18264850","18268550"," Oh, I don't know if I can set this up or not."
"18272150","18273690"," Shoot, hold on one second here. "
"18284140","18285660"," I hope I can set this up."
"18289390","18290710"," I'm not, I'm not prepared."
"18291830","18292990"," Yeah, there it is right there. "
"18295170","18296270"," Hold on a second here."
"18300140","18301020"," Right there."
"18307980","18311040"," And then this is gonna be, this is gonna be kind of wonky. "
"18315600","18316260"," Come on here."
"18317460","18321040"," How do I fade on this?"
"18321260","18322280"," I forgot how to fade this."
"18341190","18341510"," Shit. "
"18350880","18352260"," So, so this will be fun anyways."
"18355080","18356840"," All right, it's gonna be, it's gonna be what it is."
"18357100","18358160"," So bear with me here, okay?"
"18371660","18373160"," Well, this is gonna be, this is gonna be crazy. "
"18394050","18395390"," And one quick second here."
"18399140","18399760"," All right."
"18399820","18400800"," That's working in the background. "
"18402660","18404920"," Uh, bup, bup, bup."
"18408620","18410460"," Oh, come on, cats, be right."

"18417830","18420890"," So like cat, but generals are starting to look somewhat proportioned."
"18426590","18428350"," Big balls, now small balls right now."
"18430970","18432970"," Well, big balls, are you okay out there?"
"18437180","18438500"," Where are you going, big balls?"
"18442000","18443200"," What happened to big balls?"

"18687270","18688850"," Hold on a second here."
"18692210","18693850"," You guys want to see the intro at least?"
"18694630","18696090"," No, I don't want to upload that. "
"18698970","18699930"," Hold on a second here."
"18700790","18701430"," What's going on?"
"18701650","18702950"," Yeah, all kinds of craziness going on."
"18703130","18703950"," Turn that thing down. "
"18712540","18714060"," We should play the intro at least."
"18716840","18718520"," We play the intro at least somewhere."
"18718620","18720040"," I mean, it's a cool ass intro. "
"18721000","18722020"," Does that work right there?"
"18723500","18725000"," Yeah, you want to see the walk up music?"
"18725260","18726240"," Tell me if you like this or not."
"18727360","18730240"," No, I don't have a scene for this right yet, so..."
"18730700","18732380"," We're going to deal with what we're going to deal with here."
"18733220","18736700"," Uh, until I make a scene, but I'm creating scenes for people to come on the show. "
"18738400","18738720"," Um..."
"18738720","18739800"," I'm going to play right now."
"18739900","18740360"," It's going to be loud."
"18740980","18742040"," Turn your headphones down at home. "
"18744440","18746100"," I don't need to play right here, man."
"18746100","18746540"," I don't need to play right here, man."
"18746900","18750500"," I need to play right here. "
"18751800","18753160"," So, where's Petetti's going on?"
"18756160","18760060"," Let's see if we can get a straight-up podcast here today."
"18761760","18762640"," Oh, yeah."
"18762860","18763960"," Look at that sauce right there. "
"18764120","18764820"," We can play the podcast."
"18768080","18769380"," But we're not getting him."
"18769500","18770280"," His wife said no. "
"18770280","18771500"," You gotta go back."
"18771740","18772660"," Oh, wait a minute."
"18774220","18775480"," His stuff's on replay. "
"18778080","18780420"," I think it's baller."
"18784500","18786700"," The swinging dog microphone, right?"
"18787240","18788380"," That's exactly what it is."
"18790840","18792460"," What kind of music do you think would be better?"
"18793340","18794380"," What style of music?"
"18795180","18797360"," Let me know, because I got access to a bunch of music. "
"18798240","18800600"," That's like what I can use on stream."
"18803100","18804440"," What kind of music?"
"18805200","18806420"," It's a hot mic, baby."
"18807960","18809140"," Oh, pump, wait a minute. "
"18809240","18809860"," Who said better music?"
"18810800","18812200"," What do you think for music?"
"18815620","18818440"," What kind of music do you think would be good for a trailer podcast?"
"18819160","18820040"," Or anybody, I guess?"
"18821360","18822140"," Dude, I ordered a book."
"18822240","18823040"," You get a contact, man."
"18823220","18824400"," You want to start making videos with me?"
"18829420","18830660"," It's a hot mic, isn't it?"
"18833040","18834180"," Other my music was pretty good. "
"18834340","18835940"," Like, down and down and down."
"18836100","18837420"," That music's for the morning, though."
"18838060","18842800"," If I have a guest host or something, I think I picked that music for the music for the morning. "
"18843020","18843760"," Let's get this shit on."
"18843940","18844340"," Let's do it."
"18850380","18851600"," Nice electric with piano. "
"18852420","18853160"," Plenty of fuzz."
"18854760","18856660"," Like electric jazz, maybe, or something like that."
"18859660","18860740"," What's going on in here?"
"18863540","18864620"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"18864880","18865300"," Oh, yeah."
"18870120","18871440"," Holding the one minute right now."
"18871440","18873380"," So I haven't rolled. "
"18885640","18887380"," So that music is..."
"18887380","18890220"," So that stuff that I've got there is..."
"18890980","18892460"," I pay for it."
"18893240","18895140"," So I build that stuff and I pay for the music."
"18895720","18899660"," Like my intro song, I don't get hit with the copyright because it's something that I pay for. "
"18899660","18902680"," So that's where that music comes from."
"18903320","18905660"," If you ever interested in ordering a bigger, let me know, man."
"18910460","18912060"," I'm going to try to class up the place. "
"18912280","18913360"," Let's look at this right here really quick."
"18933770","18934690"," Oh, my."
"18935270","18936010"," What is that?"
"18948810","18950190"," What is that?"
"18952510","18953070"," Hold on. "
"18953250","18954170"," Venice, by what?"
"18955970","18956670"," You got..."
"18956670","18957030"," I got a..."
"18957030","18957610"," You know what I got to do?"
"18957750","18958670"," I'm learning right now."
"18959270","18961230"," I need to switch up the music around here."
"18961430","18966270"," You guys all have really good taste in music and it's very eclectic in a wide range. "
"18967330","18968390"," Venice by Dinka."
"18971070","18973290"," I thought I listened to this on..."
"18973290","18976270"," Didn't I listen to Venice by Dinka on Twitter one night with you?"
"18977290","18977750"," Or someone..."
"18977750","18981010"," I thought someone put a chip that slapped those jams on me one night."
"18982910","18984170"," That's right, BTS. "
"18985510","18986990"," Did you see how all the..."
"18986990","18987970"," Did you guys sit?"
"18988110","18988890"," Those are my daughters."
"18989150","18989910"," They're all BTS army."
"18990770","18992390"," And they've got other pop stars. "
"18992710","18993650"," They're sliding them right now."
"18993870","18995450"," So there was a big TikTok war going on."
"18996730","18998710"," So I keep making fun of my daughters. "
"18998990","19001170"," But my daughters sent me a picture from U of M."
"19002130","19002870"," And I'm like, oh, watch out."
"19003050","19004970"," There's a..."
"19004970","19007010"," There's some TikTok gang behind you."
"19007110","19009430"," They want to start some trouble because you're a BTS army. "
"19014810","19015670"," You know what, Jared?"
"19017070","19018970"," I might have by accident."
"19020830","19021750"," That might have been me."
"19022450","19023670"," If I did unmod you. "
"19023790","19024590"," No, you're a mod dude."
"19026090","19026930"," Jared, you're a mod."
"19027050","19027670"," I see you're a mod. "
"19028450","19029370"," Are you on time on YouTube?"
"19030150","19030410"," You're a mod."
"19030510","19031470"," I can see a mod crumb, bro."
"19031630","19031910"," You're a mod. "
"19033230","19035570"," You're a mod dude."
"19036890","19037530"," I am guilty."
"19038770","19039390"," Here's the deal. "
"19040370","19044150"," I go through the moderators on YouTube and Twitch."
"19045270","19045710"," And..."
"19045710","19048410"," I don't know about Twitch specifically, but YouTube."
"19049130","19052470"," By accident, if you click unmod, the name is gone. "
"19052910","19053170"," They're gone."
"19054730","19055170"," I can't..."
"19055170","19056010"," Oh, shit."
"19056190","19059670"," I can't remember their name, like their actual screen name to mod them again. "
"19060670","19063090"," So if we ever find out, like, I am modded you is by mistake."
"19063590","19067690"," If I didn't say, like, you're unmodded for a reason or something, you're unmodded by mistake."
"19070690","19071710"," Oh, it's not the crown. "
"19072090","19072710"," It's the sword."
"19074570","19075910"," Yeah, I'm captain of five figures."
"19077010","19078350"," Jared, I'm an unmoded you, man. "
"19078810","19079710"," Let me see how to do this."
"19080030","19080410"," Hold on a second."
"19083070","19086410"," Yeah, so Jared, are you talking about..."
"19087130","19087710"," Let's be clear here. "
"19088650","19091410"," Were you a moderator on YouTube and Twitch or just YouTube?"
"19092870","19093910"," Yeah, I might have fat-fingered it."
"19094710","19095770"," I'll do a mod you on Twitch."
"19096550","19097490"," I can mod you on Twitch, I think. "
"19098370","19100210"," Let me see if I can mod you here."
"19103220","19104920"," I'm totally fucking up shit."
"19105260","19107140"," I'm totally making mistakes here. "
"19112420","19113800"," I got a mod to trade the trigger."
"19113940","19114340"," Oh, shit."
"19114460","19115200"," I got to do that, don't I?"
"19117300","19119140"," I can mod the trade the trigger bot. "
"19127710","19128590"," And then..."
"19130410","19131470"," Where is he?"
"19135910","19137250"," Watch me fat-fingered."
"19137530","19139130"," Watch me like a timeout, Jared."
"19139630","19141090"," I'm a fan of my accident. "
"19148640","19151680"," I'm a fan of my..."
"19151680","19153200"," Boom, done, Jared."
"19154120","19154860"," You got a sword, brother."
"19155140","19156320"," Say something, Jared. "
"19158540","19164440"," Jared, type in your YouTube name in chat and I'll put you on YouTube right now, brother."
"19165640","19167180"," Is it the exact same, Jared?"
"19167420","19167800"," Can you look?"
"19169380","19170120"," Hold on, brother."
"19173180","19174080"," Where are we at?"
"19175280","19176120"," How do I..."
"19178160","19178560"," Shit. "

"19187450","19188350"," Let me see if you're a moderator."
"19193330","19196070"," Yeah, like I have to come in here and clean this shit up every once in a while."
"19198490","19199290"," Where is..."
"19202660","19206680"," Let me see if this is your actual name here on YouTube too. "
"19206800","19207320"," Same name."
"19208300","19209260"," Jared King."
"19213760","19216360"," Jared, you're not coming up on YouTube, brother. "
"19217380","19230040"," If you do not find your name on YouTube, you go to your YouTube page and"
"19230040","19236080"," at the top to the right-hand side and the search bar shows your actual name."
"19241440","19241980"," Alright."

"19775900","19777100"," So we got Amazon right here. "
"19780220","19782340"," We're going to do, uh, what else we're going to do?"
"19783520","19786280"," We said we're going to do Apple, bad boy Apple."
"19797030","19797750"," There's Apple."
"19799370","19802250"," And then, uh, we're going to do, we said we're going to do that. "
"19802390","19822430"," We said, you guys said you wanted Amazon, meta, Apple, and, um, you"
"19822430","19827850"," guys want, um, do you guys want levels on this stuff or no?"
"19828450","19833410"," If I have time, I can probably get Amazon squeezing right now."
"19834290","19835110"," I'm gonna just do it."
"19835190","19835450"," It's thing. "
"19842350","19843650"," These are all in one minute, right?"
"19844270","19844270"," Yeah."
"19845810","19856670"," One minute"
"19856670","19858370"," there, one minute there, one minute there."
"19863290","19865290"," All the stuff's on one minute right now. "
"19866350","19874060"," I didn't think Apple was either."
"19874280","19875340"," I was, I'm with you on that one."
"19877140","19879800"," I thought they were after the turn. "
"19880000","19880700"," Bring that down."
"19881000","19881780"," I bring that down."
"19881920","19882280"," Bring that down. "
"19885960","19888180"," Bring that down right there over there."
"19888460","19889640"," Put that in the corner."
"19890420","19892320"," Put Captain Jim James in the corner. "
"19893920","19903820"," Uh, the thought I had a color block"
"19903820","19904300"," on this."
"19905980","19907700"," Why don't I have a color block?"
"19908060","19909540"," I had a color block on this."
"19910800","19911820"," Oh, hold on here. "
"19913040","19913660"," Color block."
"19914600","19915460"," Add source."
"19916440","19918120"," Add source right over there. "
"19919040","19919580"," Just back here."
"19921820","19923300"," Move that back there."
"19927140","19928000"," Put that down there. "
"19931950","19934050"," Put that behind the chat, right?"
"19937050","19938130"," Kinda works, right?"
"19940070","19950620"," That kind"
"19950620","19951040"," of works."
"19952720","19953600"," It's okay."
"19962920","19963680"," Kinda works. "
"19970900","19974000"," Does that, does that look like it'll work for you guys out there?"
"19976160","19977120"," We're getting there."
"19984480","19985160"," M O C."
"19985280","19985460"," Oh, yeah."
"19985640","19986760"," The big cell worked again today. "
"19986760","19987260"," Eight frame."
"19987420","19990140"," I believe this year I took a double on 48 eighties, bought at the close."
"19990440","19991260"," Damn me for no runners. "
"20005160","20006520"," Uh, Thomas, I got you."
"20006580","20007140"," Hold on here, brother."
"20089780","20091400"," What is Thomas looking for here?"
"20101600","20102920"," 24 cents right now. "
"20104400","20105300"," 24 in the bid."
"20105460","20106200"," 25 in the ask."
"20109060","20110260"," What's going on, Hagerty?"
"20120000","20120900"," I'll tell you this. "
"20122100","20126340"," If you're already in right now, if you're already in right now, who is, who is that?"
"20126620","20131940"," Thomas, if you're already in right now, that trade, and you get blasted on him, don't close him."
"20132020","20133660"," Just hold him to fucking 415, man."
"20151160","20151760"," Yeah, man. "
"20152080","20153140"," I'll be honest with you, Thomas."
"20153860","20155680"," I'm going to be honest with you, not financial advice."
"20156580","20160420"," If you want to preserve your cash, man, I would be, even if it doesn't come to you, I'd be,"
"20160540","20162480"," I'd be, I'd be waiting for that right there. "
"20163940","20166400"," I'd be waiting for that pullback right here on that cross."
"20166720","20168440"," And then I'd be jumping on that trade."
"20169080","20170300"," You might make that trade. "
"20171240","20174220"," I might go to fucking six cents and then go to 30 cents."
"20174500","20178920"," So I would either, if you're going to stay on that trade, I would stay long it, even if it"
"20178920","20180960"," gets torched, not financial advice."
"20189720","20194180"," But I'd be, the prudent trader that doesn't have a big account was me. "
"20195240","20196800"," I'd be down here waiting to grab that."
"20197040","20202060"," Now, if I got left behind, I would, I would just count it as I didn't lose any money."
"20202660","20203420"," But I understand. "
"20210420","20211520"," Zero dates, baby."
"20211940","20212820"," Big tech earnings."
"20217010","20219390"," Let me play some, let me put some jams on here for a minute. "
"20222730","20223630"," What do we got here?"
"20223750","20224030"," We got anything?"
"20228770","20229130"," Holds."
"20231400","20232960"," With a comeback story today."
"20234820","20235540"," Well, hold on. "
"20235660","20236320"," We got to do one more thing."
"20237040","20237760"," We got to pause that."
"20237760","20238180"," Hold on. "
"20239540","20244740"," I wasn't getting any sound off of financial juice today."
"20250390","20253170"," Let me know if you can you guys hear, tell me if you guys hear this."
"20260360","20261420"," Hear a tick. "
"20269660","20271480"," Yeah, I'm not hearing any tick strikes here."
"20272000","20272520"," Oh, can you?"
"20274380","20275180"," Okay, I hear that."
"20275320","20275980"," I hear that. "
"20276120","20276360"," I hear that."
"20277040","20280680"," All right, we're good."
"20281200","20282800"," We're back to situation normal here. "
"20283290","20287240"," So we will have the new squacker talking about ERs."
"20287860","20289880"," I'm going to try to pull up the report times."
"20290180","20294700"," If I have the time on who's reporting at the bell, who's reporting after the bell. "
"20298460","20304880"," This song right here, it's called Nobody Home by Die Alla, D-Y-A-L-L-A."
"20305080","20307060"," So nobody home."
"20307780","20316560"," Nobody home by Die Alla, still sitting at 289 million to the bar side. "
"20320760","20324500"," So Delta Yankee Alpha Lima Lima Alpha."
"20330160","20331320"," 340 in the afternoon."
"20331480","20332180"," We got 20 minutes left. "
"20333720","20335660"," Everybody's coming out to play right now."
"20339310","20341410"," Not much playing left for the week, right?"
"20342430","20346170"," So this is kind of like the rapid up kind of power portion of the week of big tech reporting."
"20346750","20347590"," Everybody watching. "
"20348410","20349950"," Yes, it would be that day."
"20354210","20357610"," It's that pretty much stating what I already believe to be true."
"20360950","20362110"," You want higher. "
"20362290","20366830"," Well, you know, so let's talk about that briefly as we wait for this to take place."
"20372630","20375710"," Yeah, everybody's buying fucking calls dealers chasing right now."
"20375710","20376650"," People are like, fuck it. "
"20378050","20379870"," What a book, baby."
"20381630","20385370"," So let's talk about, let's talk about the Fed briefly."
"20386650","20391850"," The mechanics of this whole thing, it's like mechanics are complicated. "
"20391850","20396210"," You don't want velocity in inflation."
"20397470","20403710"," Okay, if you're, this of your bull, you don't want velocity of inflation coming down and bouncing."
"20404290","20414080"," You don't want to see the Fed cutting rates without some public knowledge or knowledge"
"20414080","20418380"," meant by the masses, sentiments that QT has ended. "
"20418840","20420800"," We already know there's QE out there."
"20421880","20426300"," But the whole QT process with the Treasury Department is more what we're talking about here."
"20426480","20426580"," Okay. "
"20427820","20434820"," You also and I know, you know, we all know that they're fudging the unemployment numbers they're"
"20434820","20436180"," fudging the inflation numbers."
"20436720","20442460"," We know they want that they we know they want that slope that slope steady slope or sideways and up"
"20442460","20445160"," slow when backed out again on unemployment."
"20445820","20451740"," We know that they want inflation to show man just chill. "
"20452160","20455220"," They just think no velocity and inflation."
"20459080","20464360"," I want you to know they can hold rates higher for longer."
"20464680","20464960"," Okay. "
"20466840","20470540"," There's no reason to cut rates right now is there."
"20471020","20472720"," There's no burning fires anywhere."
"20473320","20476520"," You can talk about burning fires in regional banks, that kind of stuff. "
"20476800","20478680"," But there's no real burning fires."
"20479160","20480520"," We're going to talk about this briefly here."
"20480700","20480740"," Okay. "
"20481760","20491610"," So a bull's friend right now without that QE or QT before we make"
"20491610","20493390"," rate cuts, that's a key point, right?"
"20493670","20496710"," Some QE or at least the end of QT before rate cuts."
"20497490","20498290"," You don't have that."
"20498910","20505570"," Bull's best friend is not cutting rates, believe it or not, shows that the Fed is doing their job. "
"20505570","20507810"," We've already had our big major withdraw down."
"20508230","20512210"," As long as they're doing their job, there's no reason to sell the market yet either."
"20513510","20518250"," And I want to give you a serious point a serious point here. "
"20520780","20523700"," The Fed's not cutting rates because nothing is broken."
"20524520","20526260"," This is where all that comes from."
"20526960","20532940"," If the Fed was to cut rates right now and everything is good out there, then we're going to tell"
"20532940","20533880"," them what good is. "
"20534640","20539480"," But if everything is good out there, right, and they're cutting rates, that means something is"
"20539480","20540800"," wrong that we haven't seen."
"20541240","20542420"," That's where that comes from."
"20543080","20543600"," Okay. "
"20544220","20547800"," Now, what does what does it mean when things are bad out there?"
"20548880","20550940"," We have less layoffs than we did last year."
"20550940","20552360"," Right now it's backed."
"20554600","20556980"," Is your street empty?"
"20557840","20558640"," Where you live?"
"20559100","20561260"," They're for sale signs everywhere with empty houses. "
"20562180","20563300"," Everyone's declared bankruptcy."
"20563660","20565300"," Everyone's foreclosures have gone through."
"20566780","20568220"," Lawns aren't being mowed. "
"20570660","20572060"," Huge layoffs."
"20572500","20572980"," Now, we have layoffs."
"20573260","20574120"," We're going to talk about that too. "
"20574800","20576680"," But we have layoffs going on right now, right?"
"20577320","20579160"," Part of the mechanics of the end of a debt cycle."
"20580940","20583600"," But we don't see are you all your friends getting divorced?"
"20584960","20586340"," Family members getting divorced."
"20586620","20587740"," I'm serious about this. "
"20589100","20593900"," Are you seeing all of your older family and friends losing their houses yet?"
"20594620","20594800"," No."
"20596260","20604480"," We also know that when rates were raised, we couldn't mortgage writers could write could repackage"
"20604480","20605120"," bad debt."
"20605680","20607000"," This is like bad credit card debt. "
"20607360","20608800"," Stuff that doesn't appreciate, right?"
"20608940","20609480"," In value."
"20610080","20610800"," What do they do?"
"20610900","20612980"," They get they couldn't give him he locks and shit like that."
"20613060","20613520"," So what do they do?"
"20613620","20614040"," They gave him now. "
"20614460","20616640"," They re mortgage these people's bad debt."
"20616700","20619420"," That's two hundred and eighty nine a million to the bar side."
"20619420","20624040"," So you got 30 percent or 30 percent loans, bad debt loans, dog shit loans, right?"
"20624240","20624800"," Credit card debt. "
"20625840","20629660"," And they repacked them to eight percent, nine percent, seven percent."
"20630980","20633400"," So there's a reprieve for older people right now."
"20633400","20638280"," For the price of one month, older people you hear him pitching about everything, right?"
"20638480","20639280"," I'm going to outrun inflation. "
"20639580","20640660"," I didn't expect this much inflation."
"20641160","20644060"," I expect this and I expect that they're whining, right?"
"20644280","20649440"," Crying in pain, but they're not on the street yet, especially people that are hiding that bad debt."
"20650040","20659400"," You my point here is that you need to see either that bad shit going on in your neighborhood for"
"20659400","20663100"," the fed to cut rates or when they eventually do begin to cut rates. "
"20663460","20667220"," And if everything is good, that means something is wrong that we don't see."
"20667320","20670000"," That's what panic comes in, right?"
"20670140","20677580"," They start to chase rate cuts and then they stop the QT afterwards, and they institute QE."
"20677900","20679380"," They're always late to that party. "
"20688490","20694510"," I am agreement with the QE statement that you just made and QE normally does not match with markets"
"20694510","20695190"," going up."
"20695650","20700000"," Usually when markets are going down and there are moments nowhere."
"20700380","20702140"," It is before they cut rates. "
"20702200","20706600"," Normally it's after as well, but if they're doing it before and they don't have to do actual QE,"
"20706780","20709280"," but QT ending QT specifically."
"20710060","20712340"," We also know that they're doing QE within banks."
"20712600","20719320"," You've got fed banks, loaning to prime banks, prime banks, loaning fucking money to hedge funds to"
"20719320","20720060"," buy the market. "
"20720440","20721700"," We know that it's a fact."
"20722940","20728280"," And then the last thing I want to talk to you about is the post that I have posted on"
"20728280","20730680"," my pin to my handle."
"20731640","20736560"," I'm not really a fan of investing.com news articles, but you should read it to the end. "
"20737260","20741500"," They explained very simply what you like."
"20741720","20743440"," Do you want to see cuts right now?"
"20744020","20748440"," Historically, you do not want to see cuts right now if you are a bull."
"20749520","20750460"," You do not. "
"20750720","20752000"," You want to see higher for longer."
"20752160","20755240"," You want to see this market grind higher and higher and higher and higher."
"20755560","20756960"," And there's another reason for that too. "
"20759960","20765940"," When we were back at 3450, right, the longer we grind higher, the more chance we never ever go back"
"20765940","20767360"," to see that low again."
"20767960","20769000"," Does that make sense?"
"20769500","20778100"," So even if the market does roll, remember back when we were at 3450, I remember a lot of people"
"20778100","20786440"," saying, don't worry, we'll be back here and I'll get out there."
"20787340","20789000"," Pissed that they couldn't buy this market. "
"20790420","20797680"," So even if they do fail, and we get the roll down, they want to secure us not rolling down"
"20797680","20800700"," lower than 3450."
"20800960","20804200"," Now, do I want to see a roll lower than 35, 450 personally?"
"20804440","20805140"," My main street hat?"
"20805600","20805840"," I do."
"20806260","20811580"," Do I want to see older people that are hiding their bad decision making get run over?"
"20811920","20812140"," I do. "
"20812140","20816020"," Do I want to see more companies get fucking hammered and shut down?"
"20816320","20816560"," I do."
"20816980","20819400"," I already know the mechanics of a debt cycle."
"20819580","20824560"," I know that money needs to be that bad debt and bad money needs to be wiped in the system"
"20824560","20830520"," so we can start a new debt cycle so that young people can get a chance on a new cycle"
"20830520","20832840"," to be given cheap loans, right?"
"20833420","20836980"," An opportunity to make bad decisions and good decisions. "
"20838300","20840620"," That stuff hasn't really come to fruition yet."
"20840620","20848980"," So the longer that Jerome holds rates higher, the more he can begin to route out these people that"
"20848980","20851360"," are hiding these companies that are hiding in the background."
"20852300","20856040"," Higher for longer is highly probable. "
"20857300","20861280"," And I mean, and we don't get the election not disturbing the election process."
"20862120","20865320"," Do you know what the I want to tell you guys something you're not going to want to hear."
"20866300","20867620"," I'm a serious here. "
"20869740","20870540"," What's his name?"
"20870700","20871400"," Art Cashin."
"20871960","20876740"," Every once in a while he lets it slip, especially during election seasons."
