"16390","16990"," Can you hear me?"
"17210","17550"," There we go."
"18410","20190"," All right, let's turn this on."
"29230","30750"," All right, we should be okay here. "
"30990","31729"," I think I can see everybody."
"36680","37420"," All right."
"39540","40840"," So I hope you guys can hear me. "
"42160","44540"," Start waiting for people to get in here."
"46500","47760"," If you guys can hear me, let me know."
"48180","48780"," So I'd say hello. "
"49160","49400"," Good evening."
"51460","52340"," Good evening, everybody."
"54260","55620"," Hey, John, how are you, Chaz?"
"57260","58260"," Good to see you here. "
"60180","62980"," My little late tonight, so I don't know how many people will watch."
"64560","69480"," I had to go to the, I had to go to the gym tonight with my, hey, buddy."
"71620","73300"," I got my dog here with me. "
"75300","75860"," Thanks, Rob."
"76020","76900"," I appreciate it."
"78080","80700"," Hey, how are you, loud and clear, right on. "
"83120","83720"," Good evening."
"84600","89060"," We will make this, we're going to make tonight somewhat brief."
"89260","91400"," We're going to talk about it, talk about stuff from today. "
"92680","93340"," Good evening, Omar."
"93640","93980"," How are you?"
"96820","104580"," All right, so we'll get started whether people are here or not, and they can play this back for"
"104580","104740"," themselves."
"105060","106600"," They can play this back for themselves and they arrive. "
"106840","107780"," I have to be slightly."
"108760","115620"," Make this kind of short tonight only because I, after a cash market."
"116880","120180"," I did a live stream or near the end of cash market, I did a live stream and then. "
"122680","125560"," I had to go to the gym with my children."
"126020","129060"," So we had to like walk to walk climbing and all that sort of stuff."
"129320","129960"," I'm kind of worn out. "
"131020","132100"," Hey, the king, Paul."
"132340","133940"," How are you coding?"
"134400","134740"," How are you?"
"136060","137500"," All right, people are starting to come in."
"137660","137900"," That's cool. "
"139520","141480"," Hey, Ben, you guys are all right."
"141640","142840"," I got some great news for you guys."
"144400","145260"," Well, I think I do. "
"145740","147600"," I think I do."
"148320","149500"," I think you guys are going to be happy."
"150520","151880"," So we'll talk about it. "
"151880","156300"," I'm going to show you guys some stuff that most people probably don't have that I need to show you."
"156840","157760"," We're going to recap."
"159000","161000"," What we're going to we're going to recap. "
"162540","163700"," Well, it's Thursday, right?"
"163800","164540"," So we're going to recap Wednesday."
"165340","170600"," Do you guys have poor yourselves a drink or some of you guys I know like water?"
"172060","173200"," Devin, how are you, Brent?"
"173440","173780"," How are you?"
"175080","176080"," Good to see everybody."
"177900","179200"," Hope everybody is doing well. "
"180280","186700"," It's funny too, because when I got off the live stream, I was in a discord and the bears were"
"186700","189540"," going crazy again, and I was all doom and gloom."
"189640","193140"," So I was like, you know, I'm just going to stay off the internet and go take my kids."
"193360","199130"," They're already asking, but I was like, I'm just going to go to the gym with the kids drum roll. "
"199350","199930"," That's right, Chaz."
"200170","200790"," How are you, John?"
"201370","203750"," What do you think with IWM support at two 13?"
"204290","204690"," Hey, Benny."
"204890","205170"," How are you?"
"207590","212550"," You guys, you guys, it's kind of funny because we have to go back and look at yesterday's video and"
"212550","213650"," see what we're talking about. "
"214130","216550"," Wednesday was a dumpster fire from my couch."
"217130","219010"," Love great news, better than a kick in the nuts."
"219090","219710"," Yeah, I agree. "
"219870","220350"," The bourbon is full."
"220470","221290"," I just poured my bourbon."
"221850","222950"," I just poured it right now. "
"223210","223990"," I needed one after."
"224190","224830"," It was a long day today."
"227230","227670"," Cheers, Matt. "
"227950","228650"," R.S. How are you?"
"229950","231670"," And so here's the deal."
"231890","234410"," So let's start with Wednesday."
"234750","234910"," Okay. "
"235930","237430"," I'm going to show you guys a couple of things."
"237630","238870"," We're going to, we're going to do what's going on tomorrow."
"239170","240030"," Well, let's start with tomorrow. "
"240950","241690"," How many people come back?"
"242210","248410"," So tomorrow we've got the economic calendar with the only things we've got on Friday."
"248950","255190"," We've got New York Fed President John Williams is interviewed at 8 30 a.m. That's not really a big"
"255190","255490"," deal."
"255829","257930"," He's he's not hawkish or davis. "
"258110","258810"," She's kind of a centrist."
"258810","259990"," He follows what?"
"260990","263650"," Fed Chair Powell says, what Jay Powell says."
"264550","265210"," Jay Powell. "
"266270","267490"," Good morning, Michael."
"268250","268450"," Good morning."
"268770","268970"," Yeah, Matt. "
"269230","269510"," How are you?"
"269790","270510"," Time to earn your eggs?"
"270990","271150"," Yeah."
"271350","272110"," So here's the deal."
"272110","274830"," So tomorrow we've got nothing on the on the menu, right?"
"275330","276750"," And we are an OPEC's. "
"276850","279070"," We know that we've been rebalancing since mid November."
"280810","281830"," And thank you, Josh."
"282010","283810"," I just pour a whiskey chairs to you with your water. "
"284370","285530"," I'm going to have a little sip here with you."
"289140","293900"," So when we were talking yesterday and yesterday's live stream and we were charting out yesterday's"
"293900","297800"," live stream, we're going to go through it looking again at it again for what we talked about"
"297800","298180"," yesterday."
"298920","305400"," Because it was important to today and it was important to what we discussed last night. "
"306200","308620"," For what we were looking for in the market today."
"311340","317380"," So what we were looking for in the market today, just to start the stream office, we were looking"
"317380","320340"," for no major put hedging."
"321500","325820"," We were looking for expansion of calls, right?"
"325960","330760"," We were looking for people to buy calls into January, February, March, that kind of stuff. "
"331920","335740"," And we're going to look at some charts here, but I wanted to start with that was that that's what"
"335740","338320"," we were looking for today when we opened today."
"338960","343540"," We'll get into what happened at the open today because it'll start to make sense to you."
"343540","348040"," I know that's for some of you, you didn't see this coming even though we discussed this and that's"
"348040","348300"," okay. "
"348680","353020"," Well, then I'm going to make some videos so that you guys can see what I'm talking about stuff that"
"353020","355940"," you get a firm grasp of what I'm trying to say to you."
"356080","356680"," I'm going to discuss."
"357140","361020"," I'm going to make some videos about where volatility is above and below you. "
"361360","363580"," What it means to have supply for sellers."
"364120","369740"," What it means to have liquidity for buyers that are coming up from below and try to simplify all"
"369740","370500"," that stuff for you."
"370500","374980"," And what we were looking for today, we had a couple of things that didn't happen. "
"375840","378420"," We did not see expanded hedging."
"378760","382580"," If anyone's telling you that on social media, that is inaccurate."
"383160","383800"," Hi, Patrick. "
"383800","384260"," How are you?"
"386160","386900"," Howdy, sir."
"388300","391520"," I did live up the mountains in the West, but there was no expansion."
"392520","395300"," The data doesn't support that there was expanded hedging today. "
"395300","403320"," I did see some slight hedging that was dated for the end of December on IWM."
"404440","410780"," That's not as much of a cause for concern as much of a pinning action until end of the month"
"410780","413260"," for small caps that could possibly play a role."
"413820","420540"," It might just play a role in the unwinding of small caps as well, more so than trying to drop"
"420540","421320"," the market could be. "
"421320","425820"," I guess it could be in some far off, thought think tank, it's possible."
"426420","431000"," But all signs today just pointed towards mean reversion."
"431880","439640"," And it also pointed towards us not getting a bid for an unwind of previous puts and hedges that"
"439640","440380"," were put on the market. "
"440820","442260"," And that's really what we're looking for."
"442500","446580"," Now, we did see some of it today on specific stocks."
"446580","451200"," And as we move into the weekend, they have to unwind. "
"451300","451860"," There's no choice."
"452240","453280"," These puts will end."
"453540","455040"," They're going to expire. "
"456300","463660"," But we're still looking for the buy in into the market from now into this weekend."
"464360","466700"," And then furthermore, into the 31st."
"466940","469080"," Now, the 31st is known as bear Christmas. "
"469960","472440"," And that's that tax loss harvesting day."
"473020","474620"," That's the last day that you can do it."
"474740","480680"," So you might see some of that leading into maybe Monday or Tuesday due to the expiration dates are"
"480680","480840"," there. "
"481220","483900"," The quad witching explorations."
"484580","487580"," When things actually close, real price, that kind of stuff."
"487920","493440"," And you might see some of it with some stocks that they want to sell down into the 31st. "
"493440","500240"," So my assumption is here that there are some, some more small cap stocks that they want to sell"
"500240","503320"," down their positions in until the 31st."
"503800","506580"," But I don't think that holds the market back as we move forward."
"506920","508280"," It's that we're actually going to move up now. "
"508280","510020"," We had that vantage rate on Friday."
"510020","510900"," We're going to look real quick."
"510920","512659"," I want to talk to you guys about some stuff here. "
"513220","517980"," So on, so on Wednesday here, right, we had this big vantage rate."
"518120","518760"," It was what 100."
"518900","519620"," I think it was 140. "
"520100","523580"," The key that you have to look at is this is this was the chart that we had for spy"
"523580","525460"," heading into today and Friday."
"526160","529060"," You should have seen this chart known that this is the sell the rip."
"529460","531360"," So up here is where volatility is right. "
"531840","537620"," You already saw that we tagged 47 five right with what we tagged for where I think I had this"
"537620","539700"," up 47 nine eight or something."
"539900","542380"," But you saw that we tagged it in the morning."
"542660","546240"," You saw right here that we were still in the sell the rib zone. "
"546240","550080"," This is the key indicator for you to try to get out of your calls if you had any back"
"550080","550420"," here."
"551140","554820"," And then down here you see the by the dip and the by the effing dip at the bottom."
"555080","559360"," So my plan that today when I walked it, what I walked in today was we were, I made great"
"559360","560460"," money on this play right here. "
"560800","565580"," So the key though is this if you're playing fd's or any short day calls, you should already know"
"565580","566840"," that right away."
"566940","570440"," You should already know that they're only good for the run that you're on anyone that wanted to go"
"570440","572640"," past this even post about this this morning."
"572640","576020"," You're not safe until we're over this volatility area. "
"576340","578080"," The same goes for below here as well."
"578580","582300"," You're not safe taking shorts any support and resistance."
"582740","584860"," You're really, you're really only good for that run. "
"585180","592980"," And if you exit positions when you're going heading between support and resistance, it's safer"
"592980","600040"," for you."
"600040","604140"," It's easier for you to get you over a major support or a major resistance zone."
"604360","607620"," Last night we knew that we had a huge put wall down here. "
"607920","609280"," We had a huge call wall above."
"609880","612140"," And we wanted this area to expand even higher."
"612320","613040"," It was actually lower. "
"613920","623960"," It was at 4, it was at 4700 on Wednesday and it expanded into Thursday to 47.5. So"
"623960","625000"," we're making progress."
"625660","630640"," The second thing though is when this, wherever this wall is, wherever it moves to, you still want"
"630640","632460"," to be selling at wherever that wall is."
"633100","636100"," You don't want to be holding through this mess that's going on. "
"636420","637500"," There will be a pullback."
"637860","640300"," Now today I didn't expect the pullback to be this deep."
"640760","641540"," This was very deep. "
"641540","647460"," And I made a mistake because much myself, I said, this is what I'm going to do today."
"647520","652580"," I'm going to sell this open and I'm going to start to buy the dips with long calls that are"
"652580","657860"," one to three to four months out, maybe six, maybe a couple weeks for the set for the holiday rally."
"658700","662780"," And I didn't actually put anything short term on until we got to right here. "
"662900","663880"," I ended up buying this close."
"664380","665720"," I was very scared down here."
"665780","667860"," I didn't expect us to go this deep today. "
"667860","674100"," But then I realized I ended up doing a, I ended up doing a measure to see how far back."
"674440","675140"," Oh, no, hold on."
"675360","679260"," I ended up doing a measure to see how far we came down. "
"679860","681700"," And we didn't actually come down that far."
"681900","682780"," Everybody was panicking today."
"683220","684220"," I can, I can understand. "
"686100","688100"," I can understand the panic that everyone had."
"688680","692180"," And you can see here that at this top."
"693120","696020"," We only came back like 60%. "
"696020","698500"," And even up here, it wasn't even half."
"698820","698960"," Okay."
"699500","703720"," So this move wasn't as nasty as everyone seems to think it is today. "
"704120","705320"," I know that bears are gloating."
"705440","706180"," That's all fine and good."
"706840","712540"," But so my, what I did say was sell this open and I spent my time trying to buy my"
"712540","714120"," longs for this move. "
"714540","718800"," If I had known that we were going to come this deep, I would have shorted the market and I"
"718800","720360"," was focused on stocks all day long."
"720360","724140"," I didn't really get too crazy until here is when I was like, Oh, this is really deep."
"724540","729240"," And I got scared down here because this is the bottom, like this, we shouldn't go any deeper than"
"729240","737240"," this unless, unless we see that cascading of hedging put hedging puts upon hedging puts upon put"
"737240","737620"," hedging. "
"737820","742020"," And then we're looking for also for people selling out of their positions, right?"
"742480","746620"," And we raised in that book map from earlier, you could see the buyers stepping in."
"747240","750320"," Which they did, they came in and they gobbled up all these sellers."
"750880","756440"," So they're just consuming retail sellers that are panicking retail bulls that are panicking. "
"757240","761240"," So that anyways, so this plan works for yesterday and we're going to do some things."
"761240","764740"," I'm going to show you guys something that not many people have seen."
"765160","766300"," And this is the hero indicator. "
"767160","773080"," And as the day wore on today, you can see as a day wore on, we were selling down and"
"773080","775220"," the hero indicator was actually going up."
"775220","781540"," And this is an indicator that's showing us that the hedging is coming off the market, that this"
"781540","783700"," market's going to spring up at some point."
"784540","792320"," And that we have to be, we have to have our eyes open for the companies that are being bid"
"792320","793060"," on right now. "
"793060","798000"," And so earlier today, I posted a few of those plays I showed you that there are bids put into"
"798000","800520"," some of the financial companies."
"800980","802480"," I showed you that Toyota Cada bed."
"802860","803600"," I show you that. "
"803880","805880"," I forget some of them now, but earlier in the day."
"806220","811600"," And that's what we're looking for from this period into December, because this is when banks are"
"811600","816960"," like quad-witching and a quarterly, when a core comes to an end, it's just like growing vegetables."
"816960","821600"," If you have three or four seasons, you're going to grow something quick in the springtime, like"
"821600","825360"," radishes, then you're going to move on to something in the summertime that takes a little bit"
"825360","828480"," longer, and then you're going to look for some kind of a fall vegetable to grow. "
"828960","830240"," And that's what hedge funds do."
"830380","831580"," They're deleveraging their positions."
"832640","836460"," They've held the market up, which shows us that they're not ready to dump, but that's manipulated. "
"837240","840660"," And then we also have the hedge coming off."
"840660","842640"," We didn't see new hedging coming on."
"842980","844220"," We know this for a fact. "
"844700","850480"," We saw a little bit of hedging in IWM, but we're still looking for more buying than what's the"
"850480","852720"," investment for 2022."
"853420","859700"," Now, if we don't see that expansion of calls with later dates in the 2022 as of the 31st of"
"859700","861940"," December, we can all put our bear caps on."
"861940","867700"," But if we do see it, which it did happen today, we had a put-call ratio of 1.6."
"869260","871020"," So we know people were buying the market. "
"871140","873980"," It just wasn't at the rate that we needed to be at right now."
"874520","880480"," But that hero indicator is showing you that what bears are talking about right now is not actually"
"880480","880920"," the truth."
"881460","886260"," And I guess I didn't read it yet, but I guess one of those guys on Twitter, I think, Zero"
"886260","888460"," Hedge was talking about spot-gamma. "
"888460","893820"," They're misinterpreting what's spot-gamma is saying about this market right now, about the swings,"
"894160","901680"," not reverb, but the wild swings that the market should continue to take until we shake things out."
"901840","902580"," We already talked about this."
"903000","904620"," You guys and I have already talked about this extensively. "
"905740","907240"," That is not happening right now."
"907880","910340"," The market is actually stabilizing."
"910340","912520"," And another thing I want to show you here is this. "
"912880","915460"," You see this, you see this lower, see this right here."
"915840","917420"," This is back on the 14th, right?"
"918580","920580"," So what is this in cash market, right?"
"920740","922480"," This is this is a lower low, right?"
"922680","923880"," Then we have a lower high right here."
"924160","926490"," And what do we have today, another lower low, right?"
"927120","928380"," So you got to start looking at that stuff. "
"928480","929520"," We have a higher high here."
"929800","932080"," And this technically is cash market here."
"932540","933880"," That's 6.55 in the morning. "
"934020","938720"," I would have preferred it to be in the actual options trading, but none of this here says that"
"938720","939320"," we're bearish."
"939860","944320"," So if you're one of those guys who are like, oh, the swing low, the swing high, nothing here says"
"944320","947700"," that we are bearish."
"947840","951560"," Even though it seems to you guys, I know a lot of you guys out there, you guys are thinking"
"951560","951820"," that. "
"952100","955940"," I drew this chart earlier to look for this goofy diamond top that everybody's talking about."
"956200","957260"," I still don't see it."
"957740","959700"," We still made a higher high today. "
"959980","961580"," So this is garbage right here."
"961880","963920"," This is complete garbage, right?"
"964140","965400"," But people are talking about this."
"965580","967620"," Then you've got people talking about the fifth. "
"968700","971960"," We got white golf stuff going on."
"972040","973600"," We got we got people telling you it's the."
"974440","977400"," It's the Elliott waiver in the final days of the Elliott wave. "
"977640","978700"," It's all bullshit."
"979020","986060"," The only thing that matters in this market at all times is volume, price, time, volatility."
"986060","987240"," Those kind of things. "
"987420","988040"," That's all that matters."
"988220","992760"," When you're when you're an investor, when you're a trader, I've seen so many times out there."
"993540","997980"," Where shot where were Elliott wave theory guys have to go back and change their stuff. "
"998260","1000560"," It's not accurate enough on a smaller timeframe."
"1001240","1004120"," They can claim that they get the big moves and that's what really counts."
"1004340","1004960"," None of that's true. "
"1005220","1007420"," It's all I've seen it for too many years."
"1007760","1009720"," I've seen guys lose their shirts."
"1009960","1010860"," You see those guys. "
"1011280","1012000"," It's just nonsense."
"1012000","1014700"," And we can trade this down into 2022."
"1015260","1016200"," There's no big deal. "
"1016460","1020000"," They can say I was right, but they're never right when they make their trades when they make their"
"1020000","1021800"," investments when they find their swings."
"1022300","1024880"," You know that they didn't think this move was taking place this week."
"1025020","1026380"," This doesn't fit that model. "
"1026760","1028180"," They just don't fit the models."
"1028560","1030200"," They end up adding an extra number or letter."
"1030359","1030920"," And I'm sorry guys. "
"1031079","1031560"," If you guys are."
"1031980","1034319"," If you guys know this stuff, then I'm sorry."
"1034420","1036640"," It doesn't work as a trader or as an investor. "
"1037140","1037740"," I've done it before."
"1037740","1038619"," I've tried it."
"1038960","1039579"," And then you've got them. "
"1039760","1044640"," Then you get the bastardization of Elliott wave by so many years have gone by."
"1045020","1047420"," And then some people call themselves Paris and they're not whatever."
"1047920","1048980"," So I'm sorry. "
"1049240","1049520"," The numbers."
"1049720","1053340"," The numbers do not agree with this taking place as we move forward."
"1054340","1057260"," Nothing about where we are agrees with this. "
"1057580","1061500"," This to me looks like this actually looks to me like heading straight."
"1061500","1063320"," And we've talked about I posted about this."
"1063640","1065100"," When you guys start looking at. "
"1065640","1070340"," When you guys start looking at the rebalancing of the trade from 2020."
"1070940","1072380"," It's a big job to do."
"1072580","1078460"," These guys these banks have tons of work to do to end this trade that started two years ago. "
"1078840","1081520"," They've done a great job at it to be all on it."
"1081520","1084980"," Because bears have said when this trade ends that the market crashes."
"1085640","1089680"," Like it was an immediate thing that was going to take place immediately stocks are going to start"
"1089680","1093620"," selling off immediately the unwind was going to happen and everything was going to crash. "
"1094080","1095020"," And that just hasn't happened."
"1095380","1096720"," And I really don't care if we trade down."
"1096960","1098220"," We're still making higher highs. "
"1098320","1098780"," We got one here."
"1099020","1099500"," We got one here."
"1099920","1101440"," I don't think we made this one. "
"1101860","1103400"," But we did make this one right here."
"1103560","1103640"," Right."
"1104240","1104900"," This wasn't expected. "
"1105700","1107020"," Bears will tell you that this wasn't expected."
"1107480","1108620"," So it's all bullshit."
"1108720","1112400"," When you hear this stuff from people that it's all it's horseshit. "
"1112740","1114300"," You had a mean revision today."
"1114660","1116160"," A reversion in the market."
"1116600","1118240"," The hero indicator went up today. "
"1118800","1123440"," Those are important data points that you have to consider as we move forward."
"1123760","1125800"," Does that mean we get weak into the next few days?"
"1126100","1126420"," I don't know."
"1126840","1128140"," Does that mean we're weak tomorrow?"
"1128800","1130480"," I don't know if the market catches a bit. "
"1130480","1131580"," I don't want to show you something else too."
"1131860","1132420"," That's important."
"1133080","1134880"," Let's take one of these shit stocks up. "
"1135020","1137340"," Let's look at like what shit stock sold off today."
"1139440","1140760"," The pins sell off today."
"1141000","1142020"," I'm going to show you some of the stuff. "
"1142300","1143800"," I'm going to show you the charts I did for yesterday."
"1144400","1145080"," Let's look at pins."
"1145420","1145540"," Okay. "
"1146120","1146600"," One year."
"1147860","1148580"," Let's look at pins."
"1148900","1148940"," Okay. "
"1149760","1151560"," So when I talk to you guys about a hedge wall."
"1152080","1152180"," Right."
"1152180","1152260"," Right. "
"1153800","1155980"," This hedge wall keeps moving down."
"1156280","1156340"," Right."
"1157240","1159340"," When you see a hedge wall come down like this. "
"1159980","1163060"," It's all fine and dandy unless liquidity comes in the market."
"1163220","1165160"," The moment that liquidity comes into the market."
"1165640","1166080"," Right. "
"1166560","1168440"," This creates a squeeze type situation."
"1169120","1170720"," And I'm not saying that pins is there."
"1170840","1172140"," I don't think their hedge wall is this low. "
"1172580","1173260"," I think it's higher now."
"1173340","1174080"," I think it's like up here."
"1174560","1175340"," But I'll look at. "
"1175440","1178620"," I haven't looked yet to do the research but a lot of stocks right now."
"1179380","1182440"," That have sold off have hedge walls."
"1183320","1184500"," That are so low. "
"1185100","1188440"," And that is part of what took place here when there was."
"1189220","1195960"," There was a Tesla move that took place recently that where I said, Hey, we are in squeeze"
"1195960","1202040"," conditions on Tesla and we wound up squeezing and these hedge funds knew that we were in squeeze"
"1202040","1205040"," conditions and knew the danger of liquidity coming in."
"1205040","1211500"," And to be honest with you that as the days pass, if liquidity comes into this market like it did"
"1211500","1213640"," yesterday, it's going to be the same situation. "
"1214180","1214820"," We're just going to start."
"1214940","1217180"," Vanna squeeze and up and up and up and up."
"1217400","1223360"," This doesn't end well for bears or for anyone that's has this short thesis the moment liquidity"
"1223360","1223820"," hits. "
"1224100","1225460"," We've already seen how it happens."
"1225500","1226500"," We've already seen it."
"1226620","1231620"," We'll see it happen and continue to happen in the future if we start to see expanded call buying"
"1231620","1233360"," into the into the first of the year. "
"1233360","1236940"," So I'm not listening to this garbage and bullshit that any of these people are talking about."
"1237280","1238660"," And we sold the open today."
"1239020","1245200"," And my job was to buy was to buy for this upcoming year and most hedge funds today were working"
"1245200","1250400"," on buying and selling some of their positions to get out from underneath there to get out with"
"1250400","1251080"," profit today. "
"1252100","1256000"," And to close out some of their shorts that they had heading into today."
"1256100","1257920"," So none of this is shocking to me."
"1257920","1264200"," The only panic I had this morning or this afternoon at the close was the moment when we got real"
"1264200","1265200"," low inside the market. "
"1265720","1268280"," And you can see that furthermore inside inside of this."
"1268780","1272160"," And we we we we we we zoned all this out today."
"1272420","1276800"," If you look at last night, if you look at if you look at S&P 500 from last night,"
"1276980","1279420"," this is how high we went on the on the ES. "
"1280120","1281280"," I mean, look at this."
"1281500","1282720"," What did you expect to happen?"
"1283500","1285000"," Let me ask any of you guys out there."
"1285180","1290280"," What do you what do you expect to happen when we put that when we put this this this this"
"1290280","1294520"," this channel above us heading into this morning. "
"1294900","1298760"," I mean, did anybody really think you know what I did I took the money and I ran this morning."
"1299160","1302600"," And if any of you didn't take the money and run this morning right here."
"1302600","1306000"," That's just something it just all it is is I didn't know you're right. "
"1306140","1306620"," That's all it means."
"1306800","1307240"," I didn't know."
"1307700","1308400"," Maybe I got it. "
"1308500","1310860"," You know what I should do is start sharing these charts with you guys."
"1311480","1314960"," I'm gonna you know what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get these charts to you."
"1315340","1319600"," Even if you have the free software they're 15 minute delay but you can actually see us. "
"1319820","1322960"," You could have seen this this morning and known to sell you're open."
"1323240","1325400"," I haven't changed anything from the video yesterday."
"1325880","1328960"," There's no like no one want nobody beat us yesterday. "
"1329360","1330320"," Nobody beat a bully yesterday."
"1330320","1331220"," We won."
"1331780","1332620"," We got this close. "
"1333400","1336420"," And one more thing I want to take you back to this we will real quick."
"1336440","1336800"," Okay."
"1337140","1339480"," I'm going to show you something on the spy. "
"1339960","1340520"," Okay, this is insane."
"1340680","1345160"," I can't believe you got bears out here telling you that everything is burning and dying or"
"1345160","1345380"," whatever."
"1345600","1347200"," Let me show you something else over here. "
"1347320","1347520"," Okay."
"1348820","1349600"," This is important."
"1350280","1352820"," So the reason why I held this into yesterday. "
"1353060","1357820"," Okay, or into the today was because you can see we we had this move up right."
"1357820","1359880"," And this is where the volatility is."
"1360040","1361960"," We were low enough on this dip yesterday. "
"1362460","1364200"," This is the dip by right before close."
"1364840","1366140"," You can see it right here."
"1367020","1367460"," Right. "
"1367560","1368180"," We tagged it."
"1368440","1369500"," We bounced off it."
"1369800","1372520"," We had plenty of room to move to volatility in the overnight. "
"1373180","1378060"," That's why I had the expectation it would be green and we were green and we profited off even off"
"1378060","1379080"," the open we profited."
"1379080","1379900"," Right."
"1380260","1383820"," Now when you come into this close down here in volatility on the downside. "
"1384500","1384980"," Right."
"1385080","1386240"," You're bouncing right here."
"1386480","1391760"," There's not a lot of a room for you to sell this market down into tomorrow morning. "
"1392080","1395960"," So if I'm a bull and we're right here, I'd take I take that log into close."
"1396340","1397880"," I know that resistance is above."
"1398240","1400020"," If I'm a Baron, I'm taking this down here. "
"1400020","1400340"," Right."
"1400340","1404580"," Let's say let's say we were we closed right here today."
"1404860","1409220"," I would have taken the short down here into this open tomorrow all day long. "
"1409220","1410020"," I would have taken that short."
"1410400","1413020"," But you guys want to be buying puts down here at volatility."
"1413560","1413940"," You're insane. "
"1414660","1415220"," You're insane."
"1415420","1416840"," If anybody's telling you that they're doing that."
"1417240","1418220"," I don't believe them. "
"1418480","1423280"," I don't believe them because I know for a fact that they might they might this play might work"
"1423280","1426260"," three times out of 10 one time out of 10."
"1426260","1427500"," So that's don't buy it."
"1427760","1428440"," I don't believe it. "
"1428500","1429100"," I think it's bullshit."
"1429380","1430200"," I'm calling you out."
"1432780","1433480"," That's what you do. "
"1433920","1434980"," Brad, you take profit."
"1435840","1437160"," You have to take profit."
"1437640","1440180"," You have to know when to let the banks do it for you. "
"1440440","1442620"," If you want to get short down here, you're a Baron."
"1442640","1443780"," You want to get short down here."
"1444080","1446940"," You have to wait until we get below this level here. "
"1447240","1447260"," Right."
"1447260","1451620"," Bounce off upside down just like a bull and then take this down."
"1452340","1457280"," You can't you can't just be and if any of you bulls lost money over here today, you're doing the"
"1457280","1459720"," same thing that bears do when they lose all their money. "
"1460240","1460620"," Okay."
"1460940","1462780"," So these are almost perfect trades down here."
"1463120","1466640"," Almost perfect trades and look at this from a bear's perspective. "
"1467200","1471980"," We came below this volatility and I went long here because I knew you're not supposed to be down"
"1471980","1472260"," here."
"1472260","1477680"," And that same thing goes, if we dip down here tomorrow morning, I'll buy up by zero dates tomorrow"
"1477680","1481580"," right off the bell if we dip down here without without in a blink of the eye."
"1481820","1484120"," I'll buy I'll buy the six set ones. "
"1484480","1488920"," The moments we dip below down here tomorrow in a moment and you should too."
"1489060","1496280"," If in any moments we're down below this below this 46 46 40 46 50 we're below 46 50 tomorrow"
"1496280","1497180"," and open."
"1497180","1499800"," You buy that you buy that you buy it all day long. "
"1500160","1502100"," You throw a kitchen sink at it."
"1502400","1504280"," That's what you do even if it's for just one day."
"1504340","1504860"," That's what you do. "
"1505800","1510940"," It's just no no way unless there's some we don't know which is possible, but I'll throw penny I'll"
"1510940","1513680"," throw penny options at that all day long."
"1513740","1518940"," I'll take that bet all day long all day long period and the story unless this is something we don't"
"1518940","1519580"," know at this point."
"1520300","1522660"," Let's go back to the let's go back to the charts that we did. "
"1522940","1525940"," I want to show you the other time we last night we talked about NQ right."
"1526500","1528420"," And I said to you well this is kind of surprising."
"1528920","1531780"," I'm like the tightness of NQ that we had yesterday. "
"1532840","1532880"," Right."
"1533420","1535540"," We knew that we were we knew that we had volatility below."
"1535920","1542940"," I told you yesterday how deep how deep NQ could go and that it was improbable that it would happen"
"1542940","1544140"," and it didn't happen. "
"1544140","1548560"," And then I told you more than likely we'll shoot up here and bang right off it yesterday."
"1548800","1549520"," And that's what we did."
"1549640","1550780"," We did it before we even opened. "
"1551240","1554680"," We bang down and what do we find shockingly support."
"1555360","1557400"," So nothing's changed since yesterday's video."
"1558020","1561160"," Nothing sold off since yesterday's video at NQ. "
"1561500","1562380"," It's just tightening."
"1562640","1566760"," You've got a volatility put in hedge wall that's squeezing NQ."
"1567530","1568740"," And I talked to you about that. "
"1569040","1571600"," We have to find a bid in the market."
"1571920","1578580"," You should expect at this point to be finding beaten down tech stocks to catch a bid between now"
"1578580","1580920"," yesterday and the 31st."
"1580980","1587760"," If they catch a bid between now and the 31st the move up is to 17,000 without a blink"
"1587760","1588160"," of an eye. "
"1589060","1590760"," Absolutely without a blink of an eye."
"1590760","1596280"," And I would all day long rather be taking this long than be way up here at 1700 talking about"
"1596280","1599420"," going to 17,000 and taking it to 18,000."
"1599600","1602440"," If anything I would be saying the exact opposite to you. "
"1602860","1604440"," I'd be saying we're at 17,000."
"1604940","1607520"," There's no way we're going to 18,000 and the risk is on the downside."
"1608460","1610900"," Right now this is not proving risk in this market. "
"1611500","1620040"," I would have to see a cascade of sellers a cascade of put not just puts but put hedging."
"1620040","1628020"," Like a full on waterfall you'll just see spy puts just pouring down non stop all day long."
"1628120","1632860"," Do I care about $6 million SPX puts being sold yet?"
"1633060","1634800"," No, I think it's all positive. "
"1634960","1637000"," Everything right now is pointing towards positive."
"1637000","1642660"," Okay, so now let's look at an IWM because I keep hearing this this chatter you guys you guys"
"1642660","1649300"," consume the wrong stuff at some point you got to put your blinders on with what people are telling"
"1649300","1650320"," you and feeding you."
"1650660","1656780"," They get their information from banks these banks launch these operations they don't want you to"
"1656780","1657000"," buy. "
"1657520","1659020"," And this is to further my point."
"1659020","1659360"," Okay."
"1659360","1664400"," I talked to you about this I talked to you about the Russell yesterday. "
"1665020","1668280"," I told you we wouldn't break this yesterday we didn't break it today."
"1668760","1673800"," The reason we didn't break it today is because if they break this level down here the next stop is"
"1673800","1674480"," far."
"1674880","1677500"," We were taught I don't even know if it's on here anymore I think it's too late or something. "
"1678140","1682980"," But you got to let's look at this on a let's look at where we are and let's look at"
"1682980","1690440"," where we're going okay how deep we're going if we sell this this wall down here."
"1690800","1699080"," We're talking about 220 202 208 206 I mean how deep are we going are we going down to what"
"1699080","1704620"," 1930 down here if we start heading down down there right I guarantee you that the rest of the"
"1704620","1705620"," market falls with it."
"1705620","1707040"," And then you're like well we're right on this edge. "
"1707580","1715740"," This is like saying that we're up here at 2467 and we're going to and we're going to 3000 this"
"1715740","1716720"," week or next week."
"1716940","1720060"," When a phone mobile tells me we're going to 3000 this week."
"1720660","1723640"," I think they're they're smoking crack smoking crack. "
"1724120","1726640"," That's the same thing that a bull's telling you down here."
"1727040","1731160"," I mean a bear is telling you that that's what a bear's telling you right here is the same thing"
"1731160","1732920"," that a bull's telling you up here."
"1732920","1735420"," We're going to 3000 this week. "
"1736120","1739840"," So I don't know I have a hard time with it."
"1740020","1742700"," Is it possible we trade down here sure it's possible."
"1743260","1750720"," Is there a high chance we trade down here tomorrow into OPEC's doubt it maybe for a brief moment. "
"1750920","1756340"," Do I think the whole market's selling off tomorrow because some guy that's I don't know some guy"
"1756340","1760560"," out there is peddling some bullshit on a on a social media network."
"1760560","1762840"," Nothing says that that's happening zero."
"1763460","1765380"," Do you know what kind of selling in here in this consolidation. "
"1766080","1767280"," You would need to have."
"1767700","1771720"," It would be like if it would be in say no pure insanity."
"1772400","1778960"," Sorry Amazon had a huge dark pool a few days ago all day long but yeah I'm serious like. "
"1779240","1782460"," So what did I do this morning you guys want to know what I did this morning."
"1783300","1788220"," We sold down to the first level I started buying spreads we sold down I started averaging down my"
"1788220","1788500"," spreads."
"1788500","1794160"," We sold down some more I started buying stocks I started buying about as I bought spy calls"
"1794160","1797480"," expiring in the 31st I'm going to sell them for the 31st. "
"1797580","1802880"," But you know scared of course I'm scared doesn't mean you're not scared in this market when you get"
"1802880","1803620"," down to these levels."
"1804120","1809480"," If you're a bear and you had puts right here and you see us go up to 24 24 60."
"1809480","1810700"," Of course you're scared. "
"1811880","1816400"," So what's the difference between that what's the difference between a bear pair and a bull down"
"1816400","1817460"," here bull down here."
"1818240","1822980"," You have to know your levels you have to know where the sellers are you have to know where the"
"1822980","1825000"," buyers are you have to know where the walls are."
"1825780","1829680"," You have to know what the risk is and I'm always talking about that"
"1829680","1839440"," with you guys. "
"1839440","1843860"," And when the I know that your brain is my brain is why the same way I get fearful."
"1844280","1850080"," You know not always but at these levels I get fearful at these levels bears get fearful they do"
"1850080","1854800"," when they enter the position to earlier something they get fearful you start wondering did I buy"
"1854800","1856840"," too early did I buy puts too early over here."
"1857300","1861460"," Am I going to get stopped on them on their way north or they hadn't a 3000 and you start"
"1861460","1864880"," drinking start hearing that Kool-Aid from the FOMO crowd up here. "
"1864880","1869460"," And you're hearing the Kool-Aid from the FOMO crowd down here right and so for the bull or the"
"1869460","1872740"," bear they're drinking it they got like the gallon jugs out."
"1873020","1877540"," So when you come to me and you start talking to me commenting and saying that stuff."
"1877940","1880780"," I think that you're buying the wrong side of the market every time. "
"1881380","1886280"," I'd buy this every time I'd buy this every time I'd buy this every I'd buy I'd buy go short"
"1886280","1887120"," here every time."

"1913200","1915120"," It happens every once in a while."
"1915480","1917240"," Do I think that the S&P can go to its 200?"
"1917460","1917620"," Sure. "
"1918160","1919080"," But I think we're due for the 200?"
"1919440","1919600"," Sure."
"1920100","1921720"," Do I think that it's tomorrow during OpEx?"
"1921960","1922480"," I doubt it highly."

"1989580","1993800"," They were getting bag holders that are bears and they were getting bulls to sell out."
"1994200","1997420"," So they can get positioned so they can take all of your money. "
"1997800","2000140"," Didn't matter what you are bear bull doesn't matter."

"2002240","2002680"," Okay. "
"2003460","2006500"," You saw a call flow up here on your right hand side four hundred fourteen."
"2006980","2008740"," This put flow was low this morning."
"2008840","2010380"," It did raise up to the end of the day. "
"2010560","2012140"," But it was all short dated stuff."
"2012560","2015340"," You're talking twelve twenty twelve thirty one twelve seventeen."
"2015340","2017160"," This is all small time stuff. "

"2085440","2086540"," You see MA over here."
"2086840","2087300"," Mastercard. "
"2088120","2088199"," Two."
"2088600","2089780"," Seventy one thousand dollars."
"2089980","2091639"," Some smart guy bought it. "
"2092300","2097200"," Other than that we have a five point six million dollar call for January twenty first."
"2097520","2100720"," Are we week after January into February March."
"2100800","2102040"," Every single year. "
"2102040","2107900"," So you've got you got banks buying to prop up specific stocks as we head into the new year."
"2108200","2112000"," We're trying to identify those stocks as the market's selling off."
"2112260","2115040"," Do we want to identify Mastercard as the market's going up?"
"2115240","2115560"," No. "
"2115860","2117020"," You got a gift today."
"2117540","2124000"," We ripped the market up yesterday and today we sold it down to a gorgeous level to go long on"
"2124000","2124820"," specific stocks."
"2125420","2131020"," You just have to calm down, find out what the banks are going long in on a down day and"
"2131020","2134200"," get with them when they're at the bottom of that stock that's going to go up into January. "
"2134760","2135720"," You guys understand all this?"
"2136460","2138120"," I'm sorry I'm on fire right now."
"2139280","2142820"," And you got Mar, Marriott, six seventeen beautiful."
"2143320","2144500"," You could roll on this thing. "
"2144580","2146520"," You could roll this out to you instead of even buying this."
"2146980","2150460"," You could go to August right August 17th or something."
"2150940","2153660"," You could buy it more in the money than what this guy bought. "
"2154120","2155460"," Five point one million dollars."
"2155920","2158680"," You're going to ride on some big bank that bet five million."
"2158680","2163400"," I'll ride all day long with any hedge fund that spends five million on a call. "
"2163740","2164820"," I will all day long."
"2165200","2167600"," And if they have to roll their call out deep or later."
"2168080","2170540"," I'm already there and I'm already more deeper in the money. "
"2171060","2174740"," So if they kick in another five five million because they started losing money."
"2175220","2177180"," I'm up 10 million right now on my call."
"2177580","2178980"," Does that make sense to any of you out there?"
"2179620","2180520"," I hope so. "
"2181320","2182820"," That's the end video is okay."
"2182980","2183340"," Not great."

"2198420","2198880"," Expe."
"2199620","2201460"," You tell me they're going to sell exp down right now. "
"2201600","2202140"," I don't think so."
"2202340","2203180"," They might try to."
"2203440","2204380"," We might sell the market. "
"2204500","2207480"," We might have market conditions something on the outside but some bank."
"2207820","2213320"," Some sky smarter than you and I as Davey trade day trader knows where they're going long."

"2327020","2328060"," You guys get what I'm saying. "
"2328240","2328340"," Right."
"2328560","2330740"," So this is going to continue into the new year."
"2331200","2333560"," And you're going to find these stocks on down days. "
"2333800","2338020"," And you're going to do your own due diligence and find out if you want to take the risk on"
"2338020","2339680"," that company and how much you put into them."
"2340020","2345380"," You find out how you navigate from now into springtime or at least into January."
"2345860","2348460"," And then you wait for your favorite stocks to hit bottoms. "
"2348660","2350360"," I charted some out for you yesterday."
"2350800","2351420"," I charted out Tesla."
"2351980","2353600"," I told you there will be buyers at nine hundred. "
"2353600","2355920"," I told you that I'll be a buyer at seven fifty."
"2356280","2358180"," I told you that that's where I want to buy it."
"2358340","2360100"," You have to figure out where you want to buy it. "
"2360160","2362680"," Where you feel comfortable being a bag holder."
"2363080","2366920"," If we sell down to seven fifty I'll be comfortable all day long being a bag holder."
"2367860","2371500"," And you should be feeling the same way when you're investing in companies out there. "
"2371600","2373840"," Do you understand so that if you have a bad day in the market."
"2374260","2376220"," You look back at everybody else and say what a great day today."
"2377240","2377960"," I have a great day. "
"2378120","2379280"," I own Tesla at seven fifty."
"2379660","2380740"," I don't care what the market's doing."
"2381060","2381920"," You guys get what I'm saying. "
"2385080","2386260"," All right boys."
"2386820","2387500"," Sixty six."
"2387660","2391680"," Well it sounds like like 10 bears logged off and said I don't like you. "
"2391740","2394480"," If you're any bears are still out there you should keep listening to me."
"2394880","2397400"," Because I'm a bear sometimes I go bear all the time."
"2397940","2398120"," Okay. "
"2398460","2400460"," And if you're an investor you should be looking for red days."
"2400800","2403060"," You should never be buying on green days."
"2403520","2404660"," Always on red days. "
"2405160","2406420"," Always, always, always."
"2407980","2408980"," For a trend change."
"2409360","2410840"," Yeah you got to look at all that other stuff. "
"2410980","2413360"," There are other things that you need to be looking at."
"2413560","2414600"," We talk about those things."
"2414760","2415100"," So I'm going to. "
"2415360","2420260"," I talked to Joe Joe dodo out there and he explained to me that I need to start making these"
"2420260","2423660"," short videos or just explain basic trading concepts."
"2424120","2424480"," Right."
"2424480","2428020"," For when you roll contracts over when you add to your contracts. "
"2428580","2431940"," When you close them for for a loss and move on if there's a trend change."
"2432380","2433920"," I'm going to start making those videos for you guys."
"2433940","2435020"," I'm going to start pumping them out. "
"2435900","2437300"," I'll put them in their own little folder on YouTube."
"2437300","2441240"," So you can go through and just start hammering yourselves with basic concepts."
"2441980","2444060"," It is not difficult to trade. "
"2444960","2446560"," We make it difficult to trade."
"2447340","2449180"," There are some basic concepts you need to know."
"2449360","2450840"," Some basic news events you need to know. "
"2451220","2453960"," You need to know some basic numbers of where the volatility is."
"2455160","2458000"," You need to know when you put risk on and when you don't put risk on."
"2458120","2461840"," And if you guys are getting scared turn off the news and turn off social media when you make your"
"2461840","2462160"," trades. "
"2462840","2463160"," Seriously."
"2463780","2465420"," At least know where you want to buy."
"2465680","2466480"," That's what the banks do. "
"2466900","2469140"," The banks know when they want to buy and they know when they want to sell."
"2469600","2470660"," They know when they want to take their profit."
"2471280","2472280"," They're cold hearted about it. "
"2472640","2475000"," I expect you guys to be the same way to an extent."
"2475400","2480020"," And that's why I got on the live stream earlier today was because you know in that last 15, 20"
"2480020","2480300"," minutes."
"2480840","2482820"," It was like all hell breaking was for a lot of you out there. "
"2483080","2483940"," Even some of you bears."
"2484480","2486120"," I was hoping that you guys would close your positions."
"2486660","2487860"," And we might sell down tomorrow morning. "
"2487960","2489080"," You might have won tomorrow morning."
"2489700","2491640"," But I promise you if you follow me in your bear."
"2491640","2494760"," I promise you you'll make more money closing those positions. "
"2495520","2498020"," All day long and you will stay alive in this market."
"2498400","2500840"," And if you carry through with those with those with those with those plays."
"2500980","2501180"," Okay. "
"2501460","2503080"," Same thing goes for you bulls out there."
"2504060","2505020"," You guys got this?"
"2506780","2508300"," You guys understand you guys with me."
"2509200","2510300"," Sorry to get all fired up. "
"2510440","2511260"," I've been thinking about this."
"2511340","2513840"," I'm like, Oh man, I'm thinking about this shit."
"2514140","2515460"," And then I see the heroin decatur. "
"2515880","2518620"," And then I see that there wasn't massive hedge hedge waterfall."
"2519020","2520160"," No, here's the thing too."
"2520160","2524680"," Let's say we do see massive hedge water or massive hedging of waterfall come in tomorrow. "
"2525100","2526260"," See, we see it on Monday."
"2526520","2527260"," We see it on Friday."
"2527600","2527680"," Right. "
"2527940","2530560"," There are other people out there with millions in this market."
"2530920","2534400"," And there's usually a chance to on F yourself in this market."
"2534480","2539220"," If you are starting to take legitimate longs into next year or into January or whatever. "
"2539240","2539620"," Okay."
"2540000","2541120"," So what do you do?"
"2541420","2542520"," You have a plan, right?"
"2543120","2546920"," You can either buy you guys think you guys if you guys really think that the market's going to"
"2546920","2547160"," crash."
"2547720","2552140"," Buy yourself out some six month or one year puts the cost 10 cents. "
"2552520","2554620"," Buy a stack of them by a quarter's worth."
"2555100","2557940"," Buy it from from now into the end of February."
"2558520","2561060"," Buy yourself 10 cent puts on a high like yesterday. "
"2562140","2563280"," Buy it buy it open tomorrow."
"2563540","2563880"," I don't care."
"2564060","2564940"," Just buy them for 10 cents. "
"2565500","2566160"," Buy a rack of them."
"2566520","2570440"," But if you're if you only have a hundred five hundred bucks trade with buy $10 worth of them."
"2570740","2572680"," Buy yourself $100 worth of them. "
"2572880","2575760"," Do whatever you need to do so that you're not panic and you're not losing."
"2575760","2576900"," If you're really that fearful."
"2577140","2580060"," If you really believe these bears out there, then that's what you should be doing. "
"2580060","2581080"," If you're going to keep going long."
"2583320","2583900"," All right."
"2584220","2584800"," All right. "
"2584900","2586840"," Ladies and gentlemen, I got to let you go for tonight."
"2587040","2588340"," I want to talk to you about something."
"2588540","2588680"," Okay. "
"2588760","2590140"," I'm going to bring you back briefly."
"2591180","2593420"," Only to focus on something as the days move forward."
"2593420","2593700"," Okay. "
"2595280","2598360"," The spy is the healthiest of all three indexes."
"2599000","2599340"," Okay."
"2600140","2602220"," There's a small pin on IWM. "
"2602220","2605600"," I still don't think I am crashes."
"2606400","2608700"," Let's we get that that cascade of puts and hedging."
"2609420","2613060"," If IWM goes down, it will take the rest of the market with it. "
"2613880","2616060"," There should be expansion and volatility."
"2616340","2620620"," That means the walls the put not put well with the call wall as the days move forward."
"2620980","2623200"," Call wall is going to go up more and more and more. "
"2623620","2625360"," The volatility needs to be up."
"2626040","2631700"," So you know for us to have a Christmas rally, we need some volatility so we can sell it down."
"2631700","2633620"," And the volatility is expanding. "
"2634580","2637140"," The markets don't always dump when volatility expands."
"2637640","2644260"," So if we see volatility rise from now into Monday or Friday, that's a good thing because that fuels"
"2644260","2646540"," a rally into the end of the year."
"2646920","2648040"," So you can look at the volatility. "
"2648340","2649620"," You want the volatility high."
"2650220","2652840"," We're not selling down anywhere significant right now."
"2653960","2655640"," So you want the expansion of volatility. "
"2656340","2659220"," You want us at bottom to make that run up to the end of the year."
"2659600","2660660"," So all these things are in place."
"2660660","2665820"," You should be looking for companies that are heavily hedged as we roll forward into the beginning"
"2665820","2666240"," of the year. "
"2666520","2672640"," You should be looking for these public companies to have traded down for a year, have traded down"
"2672640","2674700"," since February, have been sold down."
"2675280","2677940"," Like great tech stocks like AMD have been sold down."
"2678400","2679880"," They might have a little bit more to go. "
"2680080","2683120"," Amazon last night we talked about where I wanted to be a buyer at it."
"2683300","2685460"," It was much lower and it did go lower today."
"2686240","2691220"," You're going to be looking for me to be posting call like big calls, million dollars, five million"
"2691220","2692580"," dollars, six million dollars. "
"2693020","2696900"," That's where they're back during their bets for the springtime."
"2697140","2697240"," Okay."
"2697440","2698760"," And certain beyond into June. "
"2699680","2699900"," All right."
"2700340","2703320"," You have to remember that we have earnings coming out in springtime."
"2704720","2709480"," Regardless, if you've had great earnings the past two, three quarters and you're heading into this"
"2709480","2710340"," springtime. "
"2710940","2713360"," Bears will panic because of two reasons."
"2713900","2717220"," If a company comes out with great earnings, it's good for the S&P."
"2717560","2718920"," We expect 13%. "
"2718920","2721400"," That means it's probably higher in next year."
"2721820","2724020"," No one said less than 13% for this year."
"2724480","2731340"," So even just the premium and the options interest leading into February on big tech names is going"
"2731340","2733920"," to garner interest in those options. "
"2734320","2734440"," Okay."
"2734520","2741220"," So when you're buying lows right now and some calls for June or July or for February, some guy is"
"2741220","2743500"," going to want to buy those calls on these big tech names."
"2743960","2749120"," When we get into those months, you'll see the stock go down and the interest in those options go"
"2749120","2749400"," up. "
"2749820","2754580"," You'll look back on this time and say, Hey, I should have bought even if the market's selling on"
"2754580","2755120"," selling down."
"2755180","2758580"," I should have bought this call because they'll be interested in them."
"2758820","2760260"," And you can put less risk on. "
"2760440","2761680"," You can buy them more in the money."
"2761880","2763880"," You can buy them way in the money, right?"
"2764100","2766260"," And then just wait until we get to summer for the premium."
"2766260","2770040"," If the market goes down to pay you back, at least so you break even. "
"2770420","2772200"," Think about these things as we move forward."
"2773080","2773560"," Tomorrow."
"2773820","2774760"," What do I expect tomorrow?"
"2775240","2776800"," I expect a tight range tomorrow. "
"2777380","2781360"," I don't think that we might shoot up a little bit as people on hedge into the close."
"2781880","2783340"," There might be quick spikes down."
"2783760","2788200"," There might be option killing tomorrow on options that are ending on tomorrow. "
"2789400","2790740"," So spreads are your friend."
"2791260","2794320"," If we get low, if we dip down below here, I'm buying this low."
"2794660","2795980"," I'll buy this with F D's myself. "
"2796400","2796840"," It's dangerous."
"2797520","2800100"," But let's say we let's say sell down here briefly tomorrow."
"2800420","2805420"," I'm buying because I know when Monday comes, I know when next week comes that the volatility goes"
"2805420","2805680"," away. "
"2805840","2806520"," Opex is gone."
"2807100","2807960"," I know that we're going to."
"2808120","2809880"," From right now, it looks like we're going up. "
"2810320","2810700"," Okay."
"2811260","2815180"," And the only way I'm going to get myself out of those positions and sell out of these positions."
"2816480","2820560"," Today is if I see that huge wall of hedging coming in, like I need a wall of it. "
"2820820","2822220"," I need a big, big fat wall."
"2822720","2823220"," All right."
"2823380","2824700"," So my answer is no right now. "
"2824920","2825460"," The answer is no."
"2825600","2828280"," We're not selling the market until I see it actually start to happen."
"2828920","2829780"," You guys got me?"
"2831200","2832100"," You guys got me?"
"2833320","2835840"," You guys don't realize how many shorts we actually have?"
"2836600","2838940"," You guys have, you guys don't, you have no idea. "
"2839380","2840460"," We don't need any more shorts."
"2840660","2841580"," You guys have no idea."
"2841580","2846380"," How short dated the shorts we have or short dated the puts we have are that we have on there. "
"2846740","2848880"," You have no idea that how many we have falling off."
"2848920","2851340"," It is massive, massive."
"2852740","2858800"," If we don't see a wall, a literal, not a wall, but cascade of puts coming into the market in"
"2858800","2862760"," the next few days, leading into tomorrow and the 31st, watch out. "
"2863180","2864120"," Watch out if you're a bear."
"2864300","2865460"," I'm telling you, watch out."
"2865780","2870760"," And if you see a bid commit at the same time that happens, if you see that like, you know,"
"2870760","2871960"," the most pain is a bull. "
"2872740","2877880"," At the last moment, you're feeling the most, you know, like you for you can as a bear."
"2878420","2881720"," And all of a sudden you see liquidity jump up at any point."
"2882200","2883140"," It's going to be nasty. "
"2883900","2884200"," Okay."
"2884660","2885400"," We'll leave you with that."
"2886660","2888340"," I hope you guys have a great day tomorrow. "
"2889040","2891140"," I want you to stay safe when you're trading tomorrow."
"2891280","2891780"," It's OPEX."
"2891960","2893600"," You'll see some really weird stuff happen. "
"2893960","2897340"," You'll see stocks like in the past, I've seen Tesla give up."
"2897960","2901520"," I've seen Tesla on an OPEX give up, I think 150 points."
"2902620","2904740"," The last 15 minutes, we thought it was going up. "
"2904860","2908680"," It was already down and it went down another 150 points under like it was at 130 points."
"2909080","2910920"," And then it came up 90 or 100 points."
"2912120","2913260"," These are option killers. "
"2914020","2916560"," These are to shake our shake out bulls and bears."
"2917540","2918680"," So I want you to be careful."
"2919320","2922240"," As we head into tomorrow, there'll be a lot of weird action in the market. "
"2922820","2926880"," Being a quad witching, there should be weird action in the market because we're wrapping up that"
"2926880","2927420"," COVID trade."
"2928020","2930060"," You might see things that look really nasty."
"2930480","2935040"," You might not have the time to go short to get out of that short before the option interest chain"
"2935040","2937660"," or the price, the premium price of adoption changes. "
"2937980","2939980"," You might chase something that you shouldn't be chasing."
"2940500","2943520"," I have myself personally gotten burned heavily."
"2944040","2947940"," You can sometimes, you can sometimes pick a stock, but it's pure gambling. "
"2947940","2950620"," I feel like I'm going to pick this stock to go up tomorrow."
"2951260","2951960"," It's pure."
"2952260","2952520"," It's worse. "
"2952700","2952960"," It's worse."
"2953220","2957680"," It's like throwing a dart at a wall 30 feet away with a six inch piece of paper."
"2958180","2963080"," So the best thing to be doing on a day like tomorrow is buy, look for the stocks that are"
"2963080","2963540"," getting bids. "
"2963980","2965720"," I'll post that stuff on Twitter for you."
"2966000","2967520"," You have to do your own due diligence."
"2967720","2969380"," I can't tell you what to buy and not buy. "
"2969820","2972180"," You guys are all ultimately responsible for your own minds."
"2972180","2975660"," Whenever we get like this, or things are volatile like this."
"2975920","2982460"," If you are putting on too much risk and you're upside down or can't unmest yourself up, then you're"
"2982460","2984420"," taking on the wrong risk of too much risk. "
"2985860","2991180"," When we are in low volatility environments, when we are in a low volatility environment, I'll"
"2991180","2992920"," always tell you when those moments are."
"2993280","2996340"," We tend to move slowly in one direction, typically up."
"2997440","2998000"," Okay. "
"2998800","3000760"," It just stopped me out of my yes long."
"3001120","3004840"," Oh, well, took three points profit while big sell sweep just hit the tape."
"3005280","3005860"," No worries. "
"3006140","3006360"," Thanks."
"3006840","3007080"," No."
"3007400","3012080"," So at least so you see this guy says some. "
"3012620","3015660"," He's got what's called a stop loss when he trades."
"3016260","3019380"," Most futures traders are very good at stop losses."
"3019720","3022340"," Sometimes stop losses are fishing expeditions. "
"3023200","3025620"," Other times it's because the market is heading lower."
"3026020","3028720"," It was big sell orders, but I wouldn't be too concerned."
"3029000","3034160"," You should see some erratic action in the markets between now and the end of day on Friday"
"3034160","3034600"," tomorrow. "
"3034680","3035160"," Okay."
"3035480","3040100"," But that is in no way indicative of what's happening in the market as we head into close tomorrow."
"3040380","3041380"," It's a quad-witching. "
"3041560","3041840"," Opex."
"3042340","3043680"," I wouldn't be too concerned about it."
"3043740","3047900"," It would just stay behind waiting till you find your your stock that you're looking for or wait"
"3047900","3052260"," until you find where you feel comfortable buying the spy or selling the spy. "
"3052260","3054120"," Or whatever product you're trading."
"3054560","3055620"," If you're like, Hey, I'm a mega bear."
"3056060","3057980"," I'd be waiting to grab some of it up here. "
"3058280","3060420"," If you're mega bear, you think the market's going to crash?"
"3060780","3061680"," What do you want to buy it here?"
"3062020","3063100"," I want to buy it be a mega bear."
"3063260","3064700"," I want to buy it somewhere up in here tomorrow."
"3065220","3065940"," You know what I'm saying?"
"3066220","3068440"," If you're a mega bull, you want to buy it down here. "
"3068440","3070720"," If we can slip down in here, I'll buy this all day long."
"3071120","3071800"," Does that make sense?"
"3072660","3076040"," So if you've got your own convictions of where you think we're going, right?"
"3076360","3077800"," Make sure you get the good, the good buy in."

"3087800","3088420"," This is volatility. "

"3090380","3092300"," The one from the yesterday was right here."
"3093420","3094300"," Right here. "
"3094500","3097000"," On the other charts, I show you guys the same things."
"3097980","3100300"," So let's look at the five day on this, right?"
"3101720","3103020"," You break below this."

"3104660","3105080"," We tagged."
"3105420","3107520"," We tagged IWM."
"3108100","3110840"," If you go back and look at my RTY chart from yesterday. "
"3111860","3113060"," Never moved this line."
"3113600","3114020"," 2138."
"3114620","3116440"," You guys were me saying 2138 yesterday. "
"3117160","3117580"," 2138."
"3118620","3119320"," I told you yesterday."
"3119640","3119900"," 2138. "
"3120360","3121060"," We ain't going below that."
"3121240","3121900"," I guarantee it."
"3122400","3122880"," We didn't. "
"3123260","3123800"," We bought it."
"3123860","3124940"," We ricocheted right off it."
"3125720","3126300"," Got me?"
"3126680","3126980"," All right, guys. "
"3127340","3127940"," I love you all."
"3131060","3131480"," Sorry."
"3131720","3132720"," This is old army stuff, right?"
"3135100","3136040"," So look it. "
"3136120","3136680"," I love all you guys."
"3136920","3139400"," I want you got women out there."
"3139400","3139980"," Okay. "
"3139980","3140580"," What you are."
"3141000","3144360"," Just try to help you guys to not lose your money."
"3145120","3150260"," To trade what's inside the volatility inside the support and resistance zones. "
"3150760","3153080"," Also known as also known as volatility zones."
"3153200","3154040"," We got to support resistance."
"3154820","3158120"," I want you guys to learn how to identify where they actually are. "
"3158520","3162180"," I want you guys to know when you can take a trade safely within that area."
"3162660","3162900"," Right."
"3163020","3164220"," And feel confident in your trades. "
"3165100","3169480"," And then we'll teach you how to put the right, the correct risk on when you do take these trades"
"3169480","3170620"," because sometimes these do fail."
"3171100","3174480"," You know, you'll see some of these fail, but if you were a bear and you took this trade, this"
"3174480","3175980"," is where the, where the call wall is up here."
"3176220","3179240"," You could take this with relative safety all the way down. "
"3179500","3180520"," Same thing goes for the bulls."
"3180760","3180860"," Okay."
"3181500","3184100"," And this, these zones move every day. "
"3184200","3184900"," They move every week."
"3185260","3186880"," Right now we're pretty safe with where we are."
"3187080","3188360"," We have some expansion. "
"3189300","3192340"," We have some expansion upwards, believe it or not."
"3192500","3193740"," I know you guys don't believe that that's true."
"3194200","3196360"," And our wall is the same as it was yesterday. "
"3196360","3200380"," And I will have some updated numbers for you before the open tomorrow."
"3200900","3205560"," And if you want to adjust, if you want to adjust where these lines are, you can do that."
"3205640","3208660"," You can surely do that on your own time before the open tomorrow. "
"3209600","3210480"," But these are pretty good."
"3210700","3211220"," Now you're right, everybody."
"3211680","3212340"," You guys have a great night. "
"3212420","3213160"," I'll catch you in the morning."
"3214620","3216280"," We'll know if it's over selling out."
"3216500","3217660"," One last thing I want to leave you guys with. "
"3218060","3222620"," If we're selling this market, like if we are liquidating, I will be the first to let you know"
"3222620","3222780"," tomorrow."
"3223160","3223240"," Okay."
"3223460","3224360"," I'm watching it like a hawk. "
"3224360","3227240"," Even with that cell down yesterday, we weren't liquidating."
"3227580","3227920"," That's puts."
"3228600","3231080"," If we start liquidating, you will get a warning sign. "
"3231240","3234440"," You will get a text or you'll get a post from me that says warning."
"3235500","3237120"," That's different than us selling down."
"3237780","3239180"," Warning is we're liquidating. "
"3239680","3239960"," Okay."
"3241200","3242200"," Have a great night guys."
