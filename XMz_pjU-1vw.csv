"XMz_pjU-1vw","599760","604960"," there it you have to look at this from the perspective of let's look at this as a"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","604960","610920"," perspective right look at uh let me see we can bring this up somewhere else"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","610920","616520"," from a different platform here just a second here"

"XMz_pjU-1vw","677760","681920"," so my point to you is this is that there's probably some good places in here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","681920","686400"," to buy bottoms there's probably one somewhere where we are right now"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","686400","690960"," there's probably another one somewhere down here at 2400 that's your second"

"XMz_pjU-1vw","1917920","1922080"," we've got a 360 or a 365 has been broken right up here you can see this band"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","1922800","1926720"," um we'll put back here slide this over a little bit"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","1929680","1934880"," you can see down below here 360 151 we're going to keep on our eyes on but in reality we've"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","1934880","1942080"," got a magnet down below this is 358 61 so slightly below this s2 well we should"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","1942080","1946640"," see some support in here at some point and then i want you to see that we've got"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","1946640","1951680"," nothing below this 360 you kind of have not you see right in here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","1951680","1953760"," there's a couple little bands in here but in reality"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","1954560","1960880"," we've got nothing until we get down to 350 348 major support down here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","1960880","1962400"," so if we get a trend break today"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","1964800","1969120"," come on let's see if we get a trend break here today you're going to be looking for"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","1969920","1972480"," i'm going to put another line in right right here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","1975680","1979520"," right here and we're going to change this to small"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","1980400","1985520"," and this is pretty much your trend break down here so if you have"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","1988720","1991360"," so i'm going to assume this is the vol trigger as well today"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","1992640","1995760"," we'll just write this vol trigger i haven't even looked at you can usually figure these out on"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","1995760","1999920"," your own like you really don't need fucking uh x spot gamma and all these other fucking"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2001840","2003520"," pretty pretty simple to figure this stuff out"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2004400","2007360"," so your vol trigger is somewhere down in here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2008400","2015760"," or at least my volatility trigger anything below this 358 if we were to if we were to"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2015760","2016480"," let me see if we can do it"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2020720","2026240"," let's pretty sell this down here and then bounce back up right we haven't broken the vol trigger"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2027200","2031520"," if we right say this would be your this would be the deepest bottom you should be buying today"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2032080","2038000"," if you're a bull if you're a bear right president hooten saying we are interested in cooperation with"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2038000","2043120"," china but because of its potential and not due to recent geopolitical development other than a"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2043120","2048800"," day trade here and even this day trade is kind of risky if you're bearish uh you're looking"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2048800","2055200"," actually for this you're looking for this break right and you would look for something like this"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2055520","2064880"," and watch my curse here this would be the move if you see we see like this isn't the move here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2064880","2068640"," this actually isn't the move either any of these are dangerous if you're a bear if you were to buy"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2068640","2073280"," this and we had bounced be fucked if you buy this right and it ends up going up you're fucked if you"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2073280","2078560"," buy this and it dips right here and rips higher you're fucked as a bear so as a bear the reason"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2078560","2083600"," for this too is because puts don't really pay unless you have large breaks you need a full uh you"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2083600","2089760"," need a full break usually for puts to pay enough for me at least for the risk that i'm taking so"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2089760","2095760"," if i if i want to take risk as a bear right and take a bearish trade i'm looking for this kind of"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2095760","2099920"," a break here because i know if we break this that we're going to go down a hundred point i know"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2099920","2105280"," we're going down on our points mark i'd rather take that hundred point move with no risk of a bounce"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2105280","2112400"," then take this move here on a risk of a ripper that president she calling on countries to quit"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2112400","2114960"," decoupling through unilateral sanctions"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2117760","2121120"," now that traps me as a bear so this is a buy the dip environment right now"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2122160","2128480"," down below is sell the rip environment so be be careful of this today if you won't follow my curse"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2128480","2135680"," here anything in here is a buy the dip environment anything down below here is sell the rip environment"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2135680","2139680"," okay so just be aware of that as we portray the rest of today away uh you get this out here for"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","2139680","2146480"," you guys we get rid of this and you also be aware this morning that you're going to have"

"XMz_pjU-1vw","3365760","3373440"," my limit what's our limit down risk it's uh the yen hundred percent and more than likely the crypto"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3373440","3379920"," shit if there's if there's two things out there currently that can uh force those and there's"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3379920","3385680"," two others too i'll give you four first one is of course the yen that is the biggest one"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3386240","3394320"," uh and probably the one would be number two so you've got china and um and japan have been to"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3394320","3400080"," lesser extent some other countries uh that invest in our bond market they're removing their money"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3400160","3406560"," from our bond market to this is the simple explanation uh to reinforce their one and their yen"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3407120","3412960"," now that's a big one now we've already seen most of the destruction in our bond market from uh"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3412960","3420640"," japan doing uh reinforcing their their yen the second problem that we have right now uh for uh"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3420640","3428960"," for left tail risk is going to be the destruction in crypto uh that was far reaching that hurt some"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3428960","3435840"," banks it hurt companies it hurt individual investors and we probably haven't seen the"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3435840","3442000"," ramifications of that yet in our market the real ramifications of that more than likely there are"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3442000","3447280"," people in the background that haven't uh yet disclosed how much damage is going to be done we're"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3447280","3453280"," going to talk about um earning season two here on the same topic so we've got those two issues the"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3453280","3461120"," yen we have crypto right that's your second issue the next two issues would be uh companies"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3461120","3471760"," too big to fail that can fail you should see some of that uh coming down the pipeline do i think"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3471760","3481120"," it's today no but i think the risk intensifies as time passes so that is a real market risk and"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3481200","3484480"," i'm not talking about like a bank that's too big to fail i'm talking about a company that is"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3484480","3489920"," unexpectedly to fail uh you would see it i'm not claiming it's going to be apple but more than"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3489920","3495760"," like it likely the when we trigger these moves it's usually a company that you thought couldn't fail"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3496400","3501840"," not one that you thought could fail it's usually one that fails that's very big very like it'd be"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3501840","3507920"," like a wal-mart failing tomorrow or an amazon failing tomorrow any of not even tesla would be"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3507920","3515360"," like an amazon or an apple or a wal-mart or a home depot um that you that you would see fail"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3515360","3519360"," as a matter of fact i remember back when i was a kid they had home depot and they had another"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3519360","3525040"," company called hq i think home depot bought hq i'm not sure but at that time when i was a kid"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3525040","3530320"," when there was explosive growth in the hardware and the hardware um industries right hardware"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3530320","3534800"," stores there was consolidation of hardware stores you thought to yourself of course i think my dad"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3534880","3541040"," now you could tell that hq is gonna fail but at that time frame uh you saw failure in that company"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3541040","3546240"," so you would see something like that today like a lows declaring bankruptcy i know they care to"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3546240","3550960"," a different crowd but you'll see something like that as time moves forward so that's your third"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3550960","3556480"," one right there is that kind of a failure and your fourth one would be a break of the real estate"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3556480","3563040"," market now yes uh people but i'm in real estate so if you and i've got my my turnies in real estate"

"XMz_pjU-1vw","3589520","3593840"," just sitting so my attorney he's focused on that stuff he's like you know we have less demand"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3593840","3598240"," right now because houses sit in slightly longer still have people requesting mortgages people"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3598240","3604240"," aren't getting 20% over the asp they're not getting written offers but they are getting offers uh"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3604240","3612320"," what i'm looking for is unfinished rehabs littering the market people uh real estate and investors"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","3612320","3618960"," panicking i haven't seen that yet there are these groups on facebook that i watch uh like here"

"XMz_pjU-1vw","4287520","4292240"," let's say we get to five eighty it's still a dip bite has to reject can't break through and bounce"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4292240","4298160"," higher so just just be consciously aware of this on tesla you could use this believe it or not as"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4298240","4304480"," a market cent or as a market gauge right now so if you're like hey cap are we selling this"

"XMz_pjU-1vw","4309760","4314400"," and reject so you break through six hundred or five eighty and you actually don't recover"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4314400","4318160"," that six hundred and then i'll tell you you're going through the cash equity close across"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4318160","4322080"," europe european boars is finishing a bit mixed now with the footsy in the red the"

"XMz_pjU-1vw","4333520","4337360"," so we're going to look for that six hundred as major support for tesla"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4338960","4346320"," major support that also means how does that impact the spy it shows you that today when"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4346320","4354240"," the stock market opened we looked below and there was giant demand like hey i'm down here i want to"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4354240","4360640"," buy you right so where are we going to gravitate towards to supply so we're going to trade higher"

"XMz_pjU-1vw","4419120","4425040"," price prediction for tesla for today i'm not really i'm not really if you so if you want to talk"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4425040","4429600"," about tesla where you should be buying uh if you want to do a safe bet you just do it in the money"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4429600","4435040"," in the money uh call spread on tesla and you know winky and i were talking about this earlier in"

"XMz_pjU-1vw","4439120","4443840"," something we were like hey it's going to be week into end of june i think winky said hey cap"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4443840","4449760"," historically we're going to be weak into the end of june uh my point was i agree but we're"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4449760","4456880"," down what 12 percent on june the average is like eight or nine percent uh i know i think the worst"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4456880","4464640"," is eight or nine percent uh into june so into the end of june so i think we're stretched to the"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4464640","4470800"," to the breaking point of a low june uh winky point point was but we could have volatility or"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4470800","4476160"," still weakness in the end of june cap uh so if i was thinking about my conversation with him"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4476160","4482480"," with my take and his take on it i would say to you if you're going to buy a dip on on tesla"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4482480","4489040"," i would say anywhere between six twenty five and six hundred buy a call spread make it simple"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4489040","4492480"," you know to make it hard just make it simple and when do you when do you cash out of it"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4493280","4499920"," more than likely the last expiry uh before the jor forth of july uh weekend"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4501360","4506160"," let's take a look at what that date is let's look at tesla i don't think i look at tesla right now"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4514320","4521200"," so that would be july first but because there isn't a but yeah july is it the friday"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4521200","4527360"," to do that yeah it's the friday if you want to do some safety and be comfortable and confident"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4528320","4535040"," uh credit spread uh 50 delta outside the money credit spread or a 35 outside the money"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4535600","4541360"," uh credit spread you could probably because of because of the directional movement of it you'll"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4541360","4545840"," get paid before the end of it instead of having to hold it the absolute end you could buy it in the"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4546240","4556000"," money to a 35 or 50 call spread for july first or eighth if you want to take the safer trade"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4557040","4565200"," you've got the eighth i'm looking at it right now oh and shocker surprise surprise there's a bunch"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4565280","4575520"," this is hilarious there's a bunch of interest on july eighth seven hundred c uh seven hundred"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4575520","4582720"," c's so i do like a six uh six twenty five seven hundred c credit spread expiring on the eighth"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4582720","4587440"," i'd be looking to take profit on either july first or july eighth on it if you're like well"

"XMz_pjU-1vw","4604000","4608400"," take on spreads is that if they don't print heading into that date right away if they don't start"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4608400","4612400"," printing if you've timed it wrong when you bought it the market all of a sudden reverses on you"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4613200","4617760"," sometimes because you've lost so much money i'll say you just hold on to it until well you can do"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4617760","4623280"," this a couple different plays you can cut the call or i guess uh we're talking about credit"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4623280","4628800"," spread so it's uh talking about buying and selling both puts uh but you could you could cut the sell"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4628800","4633360"," side of the puts and then you could uh keep the buy side of the puts uh to make money on the other"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4633360","4641520"," and uh my my the option i usually use i just leave it on and it will usually print due to time and"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4641520","4647520"," and shockingly will come into the money like the last hour of that trading day so it wouldn't"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4647520","4656240"," shock me to see let's say a july 8th 700c print the last 15 minutes of july 8th on tesla does that"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4656240","4661120"," make sense to you guys out there so you could be you could pick the wrong uh strike or the wrong"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4661120","4667200"," swing in the market and you'd be like oh my my call spreads are fucked and you dump them and then"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4667200","4671440"," you go back later and looking at you like you're hiding site trading where you actually track your"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4671440","4678320"," trades and go shit that would have printed that last day uh and that's uh you guys ever noticed"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4678320","4685120"," when we went on a daily weekly midweek opex and a monthly opex you ever notice as we head into that"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4685120","4690960"," opex day to the last day of that month you'll see the market get pinned that pinning is printing"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4691600","4696480"," banks uh spreads they want that spread to print at that price so they can get their max money out"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4696480","4699520"," of that trade that's where the control the market comes in from banks"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4701760","4707120"," uh so any guys that i trade with banks typically so um you'll end up seeing that the last day of"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4707120","4711200"," that trade that they're in and that you're in that it'll magnet you know they'll be panicked"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4711200","4715120"," through all of all that you can be down like a hundred fucking points and they'll drag it straight"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4715120","4721360"," up to where their trade is or drag it straight down to where their trade is uh into those expiries"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4727440","4731120"," so i'm still sitting here waiting we're just gonna sit around and wait here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4732320","4738880"," see if this 365 12 holds we have it listed down below here uh we've got one tap over here on the"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4738880","4746400"," left we'll have one more test here and we'll see if we can blast this off set the tesla trade i would"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4746400","4752960"," take um do we sell it down into earnings maybe would be the next question on tesla it's possible"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4753040","4757760"," if there was a ticker in this market that could trade down into their earnings that could be"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4757760","4762960"," tesla they have they have a tendency to sometimes do that uh so if you really wanted to be really"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4762960","4767040"," safe you could take us call spread after their earnings if you're like yeah cap i'm really"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4767040","4773920"," bearish into uh tesla earnings uh and this this leads into the last part of the conversation"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4774640","4780000"," that winky brought up uh has been bringing up is he said look we're coming into earnings season"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4780640","4786480"," and his take was we should be sideways and weak into uh the beginning of july and then a ramp"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4786480","4791040"," and earnings ramp and his point also wasn't want to talk about this real quick this is important"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4791040","4798480"," to talk about to his point was uh bears for years every quarter bears say uh that earnings season"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4798480","4806160"," is going to be bad it never is now i agree with that statement uh that uh or they don't sell"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4806160","4814080"," earning season but uh outside of overnights uh which is just pure gambling and earning season"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4814080","4819680"," typically you see the indexes trade kind of sideways recently you'll see like a slow grind"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4819680","4825840"," in the indexes um and then you have to play each individual ticker so do i think that they save"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4826480","4831760"," the stock market quote unquote yeah i think we trade sideways and down or sideways and up"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4831760","4837440"," for earning season i think you see the markets get pinned though in that range uh i think it's"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4837440","4843200"," more focused on individual tickers uh for this year so uh if i'm looking at tesla does it trade"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4843200","4850000"," down into uh earning season that's possible um but you've got a key indicator you know that 600"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4850000","4856000"," is going to be your key support uh you know that if we break that 600 uh what that tells you into"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4856640","4863040"," their er season if you see that break of 600 you're gonna i can you can almost guarantee they're"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4863040","4870640"," gonna trade it down into um uh into their earnings in late july mid-late july"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4872640","4878320"," so same thing right so i guess if if i if you want my take on earning season um and how everything"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4878320","4883440"," is lining up yeah i agree with we get to a point like you're probably going to get um"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4883440","4890000"," some sideways and slightly up into uh i want to say into let me get a calendar up here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4893440","4899440"," probably into the 30th sideways and down sideways and consolidate uh some great day trading"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4900400","4906160"," the next couple weeks to have some great day trading and then slip yourself into a low look for a low"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4906160","4912000"," in the market uh to buy earnings season on your favorite tickers so if you're like if you're like"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4912000","4920880"," hey i want to buy i think uh i think uh what fucking i think peton's gonna come out with uh"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4921760","4927920"," a new vibrator uh you can look for weakness of course and generally in the market for the next"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4927920","4936320"," two weeks and start to place your bets for uh a ramp into the first uh third or they could work"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4936720","4940400"," close the third fourth fifth about a ramp into earning season"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4946000","4950000"," you know we can say in jpm uh reports on the 14th the one that actually matters yeah we've got"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4950000","4956000"," bank week right we've had major weakness in banks too haven't we um let me take a look at excel uh"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4956080","4962960"," real quick and i saw some i saw some excel f uh right tail hedging"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4964800","4974480"," to come out yesterday this would be a print right so the highs on excel f were 36 67 most recent"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4974480","4983600"," highs uh we got bank earnings coming out uh in the middle of july right so we're at the end of"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4983680","4989680"," it's 6 17 right now so if you took uh i'll look and see right now what these calls were i'll"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4989680","4994960"," take a peek for you right now now there are some there were some some uh hedging right tail hedging"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","4994960","5003280"," on on banks now also if you're a bear or bull out there listening right now this isn't banking on a"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5003280","5011360"," good uh er report from the banks this is just banking on the premium the interest"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5012240","5021280"," right the um the interest in the event itself so uh usually if you're buying these now you usually"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5021280","5028880"," sell them before we ever get to an er report there's kind of two ways to trade um two or three"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5028880","5033280"," ways you can trade earning season the the responsible way to trade an earning season is"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5034800","5038400"," i think this i think company x is going to trade down into their"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5039280","5043760"," earning season or i think people are going to buy calls"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5046000","5051600"," right so you could be selling calls into their earnings right outside the money calls"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5052560","5056320"," buy the underlying especially you notice they're a great one so if you're not if you don't have a"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5056320","5062320"," lot of money look for anything that's been whacked like look for like a snap or something or something"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5062320","5067840"," that's been squeezed a few times doesn't have a ton of short interest on it but the you expect"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5067920","5072480"," to trade down and sell outside the money calls on it and then you and you didn't for just before"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5072480","5078720"," their er oh man let me take a look at xlf in here and see let me see what i can find in xlf i saw"

"XMz_pjU-1vw","5177280","5184560"," they bottom so you want to see if there i won't be able to check to see if they're still if they're still holding these"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5186640","5193200"," pink type so xlf before i post this i want to see if they're still holding these"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5195200","5196960"," august 19th"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5196960","5204880"," and they're they're not really in them anymore"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5205920","5208480"," they're they left a little bit on so they've already printed"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5209280","5214240"," so if you look at august 19th the options chain and august 19th xlf they've got you still got uh"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5214240","5218960"," one one point four five thousand contracts on not really huge"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5218960","5222320"," originally they had i'm not going to post this on twitter originally they had"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5223040","5225920"," um they had how many contracts"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5227920","5233680"," they had uh fifty five thousand contracts out there looks like they've taken profit at this point"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5234560","5240240"," and they've come into the money so they they they they they've made this trade on"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5241200","5243120"," june 15th just two days ago"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5248720","5252160"," we were at thirty two dollars they bought these puts and it looks like it looks like they've"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5252160","5256000"," monetized some of them and then they left some of them on so it looks like the trade's been paid"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5256000","5263360"," for if i had to guess they placed the trade on they got paid on paying for what they wanted to"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5263360","5268080"," leave on another on a free trade so they've got two thousand call two thousand puts that are"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5268080","5276320"," basically free uh into uh the er season i'm not going to post this one but this is a key here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5276320","5282000"," is that you've got the hedge down to 30 bucks uh they've got on xlf i'm going to expect xlf to"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5282000","5286080"," actually make a run uh to set some usually banks sell off into their er's"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5286720","5290320"," that's actually the typical i think for banks to solve in their er's but there is still"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5291360","5299440"," interest on that 30 put so august 19th 30p they're going for a dollar 18 to a dollar 22 not really"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5299440","5305840"," a huge spread on them uh i'm not seeing any calls out there there's no out and there's no"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5306320","5314000"," on calls on xlf right now so we've got the 30p all the interest is on the put side right now it"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5314000","5322000"," looks like 30p one dollar 18 or dollar 22 they paid uh what do they pay for these things it's not"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5322000","5327840"," showing what they paid i could do the math on it but i'm not gonna you can do it on your own i think"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5327840","5336560"," so the puts they put on was uh hula near one block was uh 44,052 contracts"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5337760","5342560"," they spent six point three million dollars so you can you can do your own calculator with that"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5343120","5348160"," find out what they paid for them looks like they've made a little bit of money probably 20 percent or"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5348160","5353600"," some but 30 30p for xlf"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5357840","5363760"," so i like to see if this holds if this does not hold we're looking at uh 363 as the next"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5363760","5364640"," level down below"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5368960","5370480"," on the on the spine i'm talking about"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5378960","5383520"," i'm gonna go over uh one quick thing with you we're going to talk about um"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5385600","5393200"," we're support and resistance is uh so 3700 is real support so we want to be able to get"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5393200","5396000"," we want to try to get back up into that today 3700"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5398080","5402880"," uh there's another this is a note from spot gamet says that it does not appear that we lost"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5402880","5406000"," much in the way of put america bring this over for you guys so i can read it to you"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5406880","5408720"," take a little take a little break here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5410800","5414720"," uh we'll start right here does that appear that we lost much in the way of puts yesterday"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5415760","5422000"," uh with uh 30 of total s&p delta is expiring today this indicates that a lot of the put fuel"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5422560","5428240"," in which could spark a rally is still in place right so it's still there it hasn't been spent"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5428240","5434480"," yet it wasn't spent yesterday the critical positioning here uh the critical positioning"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5434560","5437280"," here is best captured through the gamma chart shown below"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5437840","5442400"," now how the teal line today is gamma shifts markedly higher after today's opex"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5442400","5447920"," the black line this shift is due to is due almost entirely to large puts rolling off"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5448800","5455360"," further note the pink in the teal line at the uh 3700 which is due to the 35 000 at the money"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5455360","5464080"," puts which expire at 930 a.m. eastern standard time we saw that rip off of the open this morning"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5464080","5471600"," right due to those expiring puts placing this expiration in historical context in our is our"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5471600","5478480"," delta tilt indicator which measures put delta call delta you can see that we are at march of 20"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5478480","5486080"," december 18 levels as a result of these large puts you can see it right here okay"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5488800","5492400"," you can see it right here too in the past right you can see this right here we need to"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5492400","5497680"," take a look back in here uh december of 2018 right about here"

"XMz_pjU-1vw","5504640","5510480"," typically we get one a slight run higher this would this would lead us into middle of summer"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5513040","5518480"," as a result of these large puts expiration will force this metric higher see red dotted arrow"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5518560","5523440"," bottom right hand side okay you can see it right here you can see how low we are right here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5524000","5529120"," i want you to watch my cursor right here okay you guys see this you guys see my cursor right here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5531520","5533040"," right see where you are right here"

"XMz_pjU-1vw","5543360","5550960"," which is right here watch my cursor right down here right so i want you to see this as a market"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5550960","5558800"," bottom i want you to also see this as a market bottom okay so placing this expiration in historic"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5558800","5563440"," context is our delta tilt indicator which measures put delta call delta you can see that we are at"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5563440","5570480"," march of 2020 in december of 18 levels as a result of these large puts expiration will force this"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5570480","5577120"," metric higher okay so we're probably at a localized bottom uh you could have a bear out there telling"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5577120","5581760"," you yeah we're gonna burn it down to 350 it's it i would say that in a normal trading range right"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5581760","5588080"," now like 360 to 410 it's probable that we'll trade outside of that range at some point in the next"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5588080","5592960"," couple weeks right uh but do i think that that's the end of the world and we're burning this mark"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5592960","5600400"," down fuck no it means that we're probably probably at a bottom right now so take"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5600400","5608800"," this into into into uh take this into consideration as we trade forward take into consideration that"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5608800","5614880"," we have jump risk that jump risk is when we have a market meltdown what do we need to happen for a"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5614880","5621120"," market meltdown take into consideration that we probably have a cessation of hostilities coming"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5621120","5627520"," up in ukraine it's been going on for many months now i want you to take all absorb all of this right"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5627520","5634880"," so you're looking at some some kind of support in the market technically not i think we're doing"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5634880","5641760"," this technically right historically we're at some kind of a general bottom in the market here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5641760","5649040"," okay so take note of this this morning this has been associated with rallies in the past and we"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5649040","5654560"," still anticipate no pick rally today into Tuesday afternoon take note of this okay right here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5655280","5659840"," it Tuesday is a monday's a holiday right june team there is one critical difference here and"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5659840","5666240"," that is the fed and this is the problem this is where the danger is uh because we haven't announced"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5666240","5671920"," kiwi we have no we have no fed coming out to save the market this is where your jump risk comes in"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5673600","5677920"," uh that uh we still anticipate an opx rally on Tuesday afternoon monday there is one critical"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5677920","5682800"," difference here and that is the fed in march of 20 and December 18 officials are rolling out the"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5682880","5688160"," kiwi support carpet whereas currently they seem to be doing the exact opposite another key point"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5688160","5698320"," here is seam to be doing the exact opposite that's key i wanted to take note of that because uh"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5699280","5704320"," i believe that they do like to break things but if you go back in history like nine the 90s the"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5704320","5710400"," 70s fucking 2020 as soon as they break something they revert so if we get a break here if we get"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5710400","5715760"," that jump risk that's what some bears are relying upon we're gonna get that that rip down or that"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5715760","5723360"," that uh sell the market down to 320 they're gonna the next month they'll pull back the kiwi or"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5723360","5730320"," excuse me qt and the uh cessation of kiwi it that all is all bizarre to me because if you're a bear"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5730320","5735360"," then you're telling me that we're going right back into inflate or yeah inflation again right i'm not"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5735360","5740080"," inflation excuse me and easing again if you're a bear out there you're contradicting yourself"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5740080","5744480"," you're saying that we're gonna get a market crash and doom everything but in reality"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5744480","5750000"," if we get down to 320 right now like today this week they're gonna fucking institute kiwi again"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5750000","5754480"," you know that right so we're gonna get it ripped all the time eyes again so i don't understand the"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5754480","5761440"," logic here from a bear anyways um now they seem seem to be doing the exact opposite do am i uh"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5761440","5767200"," purchased or do i believe in this personally i don't really care i've got uh put back spreads"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5767520","5773200"," so i don't care if we go there i'll all my shit's gonna be fine i'm not gonna be a fucking poor"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5773200","5780320"," guy with a can on the corner uh put spread or put back spreads pay uh for themselves sometimes"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5780320","5786240"," even showing a little bit of profit and if we have an outside of the money market event they"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5786240","5792560"," print good and i can pull the fucking other side of that trade off so it's bizarre i just"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5792720","5797840"," listen to a bear on that to this point note how that delta tilt reading above has failed to"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5797840","5804160"," normalize at any point this year march point two we had very large put positions and uh"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5804160","5809600"," equal to a greater than ten percent uh or equal to a less than a ten percent market rally"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5809600","5814640"," but that faded quickly this failure to launch suggests that call virus have remained absent"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5814640","5821440"," and traders are maintaining large put protection i agree with that that any rally will fail any"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5821520","5828000"," rally will be subdued uh unless you get the fed speaker coming out and say everything is fine"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5828000","5832160"," i think i agree with that statement a hundred percent we quite frankly don't see a reason for"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5832160","5838080"," this dynamic change which which means we may be given tradable rallies here but they're simply"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5838080","5843760"," short covering in subject reversals much like we've seen all year their point is this if you're a"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5843760","5851280"," bull you can this is probably a place that you can buy a dip if you're a bear this is probably"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5851280","5857040"," a place that you want to be ready to reposition yourself for the next leg down that doesn't mean"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5857040","5863120"," you come in today and buy fucking 360 puts at 360 if you're a bear it means that you're waiting"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5863120","5867600"," you're going to say okay i might get some put spreads at 370 i'm going to get some three month"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5867600","5873440"," or four month puts at 380 390 and then i'm going to get fucking weeklies and zero dates at 400"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5873440","5879280"," 410 that's what they're saying here okay lastly we don't want we wanted to mention skew here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5879280","5884480"," which is a bit odd our risk reversal metric registered at negative point zero four yesterday"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5884480","5889440"," which is most often associated with new all-time highs the fact that this is happening with fresh"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5889440","5894720"," lows is curious and suggests a flattening of skew this suggests that despite the recent"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5894720","5900080"," macro developments there isn't a serious new grab for put protection this is key as well"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5901200","5907760"," now we have seen put protection come on into the market and some hedging come out of the market"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5907760","5914480"," we haven't seen nasty nasty new hedging and that's what i want to talk to you about which i"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5914480","5922400"," talked about earlier and that is that if we get this negative q2 which it looks like right we're"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5922400","5927440"," not gonna we're not going to go up to 4350 that means we're going to put two negative quarters"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5927440","5935600"," together typically in q3 we'll get a bounce q4 and beyond is going to be help so the thought"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5935680","5942480"," process here would be yeah we'll hedge left hill risk right we'll hedge in case we get a market"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5942480","5950880"," break in in the whole markets red bars the hell but but for major market hedges we're going to"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5950880","5960880"," probably look for either putting more time on them i.e. a october expiry or we're gonna wait to put"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5960880","5968320"," major hedges on into let's say like major like talking billions and billions more than likely"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5968320","5974400"," not until late July mid-August somewhere in there okay"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5976800","5981680"," corroborating this is the skew index which can be fraught with some calculation anomalies"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5981680","5987920"," but it signals a similar sentiment this suggests that iv will remain contained as it has been for"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5987920","5994080"," most of the year an example being that vix not making new highs but we will want to see opex"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","5994080","6002000"," clear that's the vix is going to 100 crowd right but we will want to see opex clear before reading"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6002000","6008560"," further into this so we have to wait on this point for today it does seem to back our opex"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6008560","6014960"," rally sentiment i think that's all i've got i don't know if there's anything more in this uh yeah i"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6015040","6018960"," don't think there was much more in this today you always pause this video come back and and"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6018960","6023440"," and pause the important parts of this video so this kind of backs up that same theory"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6023440","6025840"," they've been talking about uh all morning"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6028400","6033600"," uh so that you can plan out you guys are always looking for the crystal ball right well you have"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6033600","6042320"," it you know the crystal ball is telling you for we might be trading sideways and up into uh early"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6042320","6049360"," july maybe even into uh earnings season we usually get some weakness at the end of earnings season"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6051360","6055760"," and that should line up to some extent and let's say we get some good earnings out there right"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6055760","6059520"," they come out here and they've said we've trimmed everybody down we put layoffs in we've done all"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6059520","6064800"," this shit they have a good earnings season and the market is up and then we roll into the volatile"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6064800","6070640"," season of the midterm elections so that kind of gives you the thought process along the way"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6070720","6078160"," it gives you uh an established trading range you have to have some kind of outlook on the future"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6080560","6086080"," even if things go sideways you know when you guys put a when you guys put an outlook on the stock"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6086080","6091040"," market it doesn't have to trade to where you think it's going you have to have that baseline so that"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6091040","6096960"," you know how to react to the market as it trades into the future so you're like hey if i think we're"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6097040","6103120"," going to crash down to 320 this week we're going to break the market we're doing GDP for Russia was"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6103120","6109360"," up 3.5 percent year over year in line with consensus estimates i think jem was talking about that"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6109360","6114160"," this morning uh jem karst and i think it was time with that on twitter this morning was uh we have"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6114160","6120480"," left tail risk events how do you deal with that but on the in the other side the right tail is"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6120480","6124800"," probable i think that's what he was saying this morning on twitter i didn't i wouldn't read it"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6125680","6130080"," quickly read it but i figured that those guys were on the same same notion would be"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6131440","6135600"," you have left tail risk right now but you were more than likely going to trade to the right side"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6135600","6142640"," right so how do you how do you invest in trade in that uh my favorites put back spreads uh an"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6142640","6146960"," unknown risk to the market had unknown headline news but more than likely we're going to trade"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6146960","6154320"," this market sideways and up into uh the next couple months so for me i would look for positioning this"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6154320","6164000"," market uh into july and august long uh with some tail risk hedging and then i would be looking"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6164000","6172160"," for to get aggressive for the next major leg down uh to position in those months sometime in july"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6172160","6179360"," and august to be like hey i'm gonna fucking load the fucking boat on some major puts down to the"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6179360","6182880"," depths of health does that make sense"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6185600","6187680"," a little weakness down here to 363"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6190000","6195440"," and 363 is right here so just extend this down here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6195440","6202160"," we're a little bit about there"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6212160","6218000"," yeah so you have the it sucks about what sucks about opex days quad watching days like this is"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6218000","6223760"," you're just waiting for the next batch of uh put edges to come on you're waiting for the next batch"

"XMz_pjU-1vw","6228320","6236160"," getting these um rips and then slow trade down and then rips and then slow trade down as they"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6236160","6244080"," buy puts uh excuse sell puts buy puts uh take longs uh there's usually a slow trade today and then"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6244080","6249600"," what we'll do usually is uh as the day wears on after the one o'clock hour you'll start to see"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6249600","6255520"," theta kick in on puts and the dealers will begin to de-risk those those puts so they have on the"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6255520","6261040"," market and you'll start to see an acceleration ramp higher just just be patient this afternoon"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6261760","6264160"," as we head into the later times of the day"

"XMz_pjU-1vw","6372720","6379600"," uh because you got people out there that sell subscriptions so they don't care if the market"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6379600","6390160"," actually dumps they only care that they they're able to sell doom i know what they're doing i"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6390160","6394960"," think we all know what they're doing right these are the guys they sell like premium subscriptions"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6395680","6400560"," they sell this fucking doom they don't tell you anything other than what their their macro view is"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6401360","6406160"," i'm not talking about like macro 42 or or any of these other big real true macro guys talking about"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6407200","6414000"," for the for the retards out there so uh if you go in right back here you see this one touch below"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6414000","6421200"," right you see this other touch below this is the sp5 of the es mini and you can see we recovered"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6421200","6424960"," this and we'll go back oh we're going to smaller time frame here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6426720","6430560"," this is where the rage comes in this is where the pure rage comes in what we see"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6431840","6437920"," so the incessant rage comes in right here so this big move down right with the break of this"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6437920","6443360"," market here this is a failure of the market this is very bad i do want to or not this let me get"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6443360","6449680"," the whole move in so this whole move right here is very very bad uh stock market is broken we"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6449760","6454560"," already know that right we're bearish here we know we're bearish we know our overall view is"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6454560","6460800"," bearishness but the real rage this is where the bear rage is i'm going to show you guys where it"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6460800","6469360"," is is right here okay this one boom get this next one boom and what a bear really wants here is"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6469360","6476400"," uh they want that break they're looking for uh that break now are we are we going to get that"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6476400","6482160"," break is the question right but the reality is this really isn't the break what the bear is"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6482160","6490080"," really looking for was this you want to see a severe break down here this right and then that"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6490080","6496000"," move lower so even in a larger time frame you're looking for a clean break here of this trend line"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6496000","6503360"," that's been on since september that uh john alexander is bringing up you want a clean break here and"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6503360","6508000"," then you want to some clean rejection to take this next leg lower so let's say you are a bear let's"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6508000","6512560"," say like uber ultra let's say you're like the biggest bear the biggest bear let's say you're"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6512560","6518080"," i think there's a couple of them out there uh that don't actually trade let's say you're that guy"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6519440","6523760"," uh even if you're going to tell everybody that's happening uh that we're the most"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6523760","6529360"," stock market we have a stock market crash uh you don't actually want to take that trade"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6529360","6534880"," until there's a clean break of this trend line and at least one rejection minimum"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6537040","6541040"," i don't want to hear anything about like well you don't get that clean break we just send it to"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6541040","6546480"," depths of hell it doesn't happen you usually get that one real break rejection at least one if not"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6546480","6553520"," two uh this grinds up people in here and then you take that next leg lower so uh when a bear is"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6553520","6557520"," seeing something like this right now they're pissed off right they're hoping they're saying"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6557520","6563600"," fuck you cap we need this break here and you got me telling them eat a bag of dicks we ain't doing"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6563600","6573600"," that today you gotta be telling them no they want me to spread doom i'm not doing it it's not"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6573600","6579200"," appropriate yet to do it it's not the right time to be doing it if you're going to spread doom here"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6579200","6585360"," that's when you get a real break a couple rejections and then we start heading down this is where the"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6585440","6592240"," doom comes in right here right there that i'm pointing to the rejection start heading down"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6592240","6597120"," this is where the doom comes in uh it's weird too because some of these bear we got other bears out"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6597120","6603840"," there saying well i only wanted the 3500 and then we get that huge move up i can live with that"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6603840","6608400"," that's still not bearish though this is bullish if i see anything like that if i see anything"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6608480","6614800"," where we tap 3500 and head higher and if we get to 3500 i'm going to expect not a move to"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6614800","6622000"," 37 or 38 or four i'm going to expect a big push up here so you got all kinds of different bears"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6622000","6626720"," talking all kinds of different bulls here some bulls are just greedy like me i'm a greedy bull i"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6626720","6634320"," want to buy 3500 i want to buy 3200 but i'm not seeing that for myself right now what i see right"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6634320","6640320"," now is that we've tagged a double bottom we've double bottomed uh here so far and this is not"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6640320","6645680"," the place to be taking a short trade until uh we get a breach a real breach i want to see a breach"
"XMz_pjU-1vw","6645680","6651200"," to take a real a real short trade where we are currently at this moment i want to see like rolling"
