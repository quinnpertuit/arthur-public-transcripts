"16900","24700"," We'll know if we can talk."
"27920","29180"," Hell yeah dude."
"29900","30940"," Let's see out there. "
"31479","32580"," Blind nest owl."
"33280","33600"," Not a student."
"34060","35180"," And God treats John S."
"35720","35720"," W."
"35900","36680"," He's important everybody. "
"37340","38480"," What are we all doing?"
"40360","41680"," Good morning Ed."
"42440","43080"," Missed it."
"44380","44700"," Finally. "
"46040","47640"," Guess I'm still alive Stephen."
"47960","48280"," Still here."
"51180","52440"," That's why it's weird too. "
"52580","56540"," I've got a, I still have, I'm still having computer problems."
"59160","64840"," But I did send a new desktop out to have some work done on it."
"64840","67560"," I'm feeling a rise in seven in it, a bunch of crap. "
"68460","71320"," But it's, it's not doing what it's supposed to be doing."
"72480","76720"," And I switched back to the old streamlabs instead of the studio OBS."
"77100","77340"," That's it. "
"77560","78380"," I'm not doing it right now."
"78800","79820"," It's not working for me."
"80560","84880"," We're going to single loop what we were doing before until I can get this computer back online. "
"85340","88820"," And I broke a charger from my laptop or whatever."
"89880","90700"," Good morning everybody."
"90860","91300"," How's everybody doing?"
"92920","94700"," We're going to switch this right over and get going. "
"95540","96440"," This morning."
"100520","101360"," Everybody's doing well."
"101520","102540"," There's Santa going to see you. "
"102680","107040"," B.T.C.C.K. The fifth flamour going to see you."
"107640","109860"," B.P. Yeah."
"110220","112900"," G.H. That's weird. "
"113940","115320"," You're going to see Russian bots."
"115660","118800"," They probably tons of them."
"118800","122140"," I got the box mounted at this point. "
"122320","122580"," I got the box mounted at this point."
"122580","125000"," I got three tools, a bunch of stuff, and the box back up."
"126320","130200"," And I am missing one wire or whatever. "
"132060","132920"," We'll finish."
"133220","134100"," The job should be finished."
"134340","135320"," Okay, at some point. "
"135780","136720"," See who's done today?"
"137080","138120"," We're going to finish that job."
"139660","140220"," How y'all doing?"
"140460","140660"," Hey, Cowboy."
"140900","141180"," How are you?"
"142120","143120"," Good to see you Liam. "
"143960","145020"," The world switch right over here."
"145020","145080"," here."
"145920","147260"," Everybody's kind of loading in right now. "
"148340","149420"," Good morning to all of you."
"150620","152080"," We'll do the niceties afterwards."
"152340","153720"," We don't have a lot of time until the market opens. "
"153980","154960"," We'll get the niceties."
"155340","158920"," We'll come back to the niceties and all the talking as soon as the market opens."
"160480","162940"," For today, for news, we don't have much, right?"
"163840","165340"," We've got consumer credit at three. "
"165720","166600"," Be aware of that one."
"167120","170540"," That could be an opportunity for the market to have a little bit of volatility under the day."
"171780","174820"," We just slow down if we trade higher from the open today. "
"175560","177900"," Tuesday, we have not much going on there."
"178100","178840"," Whole still inventories."
"179380","179920"," 10 o'clock. "
"181220","185660"," Job openings and quits on Wednesday could provide a little bit of volatility."
"186400","189980"," But mostly, it's going to probably going to be around Thursday."
"191080","194760"," Initial claims, continuing claims, CPI, of course. "
"196700","200440"," And then I get on Friday, University of Michigan consumer sentiment."
"200860","202900"," Sometimes it matters."
"203160","203880"," Sometimes it doesn't. "
"204120","206800"," Kind of a quiet early week, though."
"207140","213440"," And we're going to talk about puts that were closed on Friday, calls that were bought on Friday for"
"213440","213820"," this week."
"215140","220380"," And the general state of the market, we're also really going to talk about a market crash at some"
"220380","221280"," point down the road. "
"221600","223300"," And is that on the table or not?"
"224360","226240"," What needs to happen for that to be on the table?"
"227480","228920"," Is it something to be concerned about?"
"229200","230660"," So we'll talk about that later this morning."
"231300","233800"," We're going to get through as much as we can as fast as we can."
"234160","234740"," What limit here?"
"236280","238380"," This is the spot cam report for Friday. "
"239000","242080"," This is the after the close on Friday spot cam report, okay?"
"243920","245400"," 4300 booth be key support."
"246980","247440"," Okay."
"247440","254600"," We could, we could see off by options flow buying the initial dip near 430 as traders sold puts and"
"254600","255860"," buy calls into the close. "
"256200","257220"," Something you need to see, okay?"
"257779","260700"," Traders sold puts and bought cold calls into the close."
"261440","261860"," Right?"
"262040","265060"," So you saw some dealer hedging after the close on Friday."
"265060","266300"," And they were up this morning. "
"266480","271900"," No matter what you've heard about why we traded down overnight, where we are this morning, you"
"271900","273480"," should be aware of this, okay, for today."
"274760","275720"," The deltas remain flat."
"275920","279480"," This is rather under mental trading in the broader context. "
"279820","280960"," A lot of traders are rightfully nervous."
"281140","283600"," The short volatility, the short wall over the weekend."
"284560","287340"," Therefore, a quite weekend could lead to a pop in markets on Monday. "
"287820","289300"," We're seeing that this morning, right?"
"290400","294780"," Expensive options should decay, allowing some deltas to be covered as markets reopen."
"295460","299420"," Significant escalation of geopolitical front brings downside levels outlined."
"300160","303120"," This was past this past Friday into play. "
"303340","304300"," We haven't seen that this morning."
"304420","305900"," There's talk of another ceasefire, right?"
"306400","309000"," And people are using that as an excuse for the markets going up this morning."
"309000","311440"," It's not really the real reason why the markets are going up. "
"312940","317200"," Material long-term call buyers still seem to be on pause and actually remain in the case until the"
"317200","318920"," analytical monetary risks are cleared."
"320120","323880"," This video right here, I posted this on Twitter this morning."
"324660","328600"," And this basically outlines if you're a bull, how you have to trade this market right now, right?"
"329020","329540"," Can't be blind. "
"330100","331320"," We went to this repetitively."
"331380","335460"," We've gone into how the markets are trading up and down in this zigzag fashion."
"336400","338500"," And he basically explains it here, right?"
"338600","343280"," You can't buy a month out or a three month out call on this market and expect it to print"
"343280","345160"," with IV being as high as it is. "
"345720","346420"," You just can't."
"346480","351060"," You're getting these wild movements within that one or three month period, which is destroying any"
"351060","353280"," kind of a long position in this market."
"354120","355060"," So just be aware of that. "
"355440","357280"," So call options are not driving this market."
"357960","359320"," Put options are driving this market."
"359800","365220"," Be aware of that as we come into the FOMC, I believe that's the 15th, 16th plus we've got OPEX"
"365220","366020"," on the 18th. "
"366240","373360"," Sometimes these things don't even play out until after not only the FOMC, but maybe it could play"
"373360","373580"," out before."
"373900","377880"," We'll talk about that later today, but sometimes he moves don't even play out until after that"
"377880","381480"," they're gonna be like, thanks for playing bears and thanks for playing bulls."
"382020","384320"," And then the move, maybe move higher will take place. "
"385280","389360"," It could take place before or after, but there's a high chance that it doesn't even take place"
"389360","390680"," until after all this shit's done."
"391060","392900"," After all the banks are positioned."
"394040","395200"," Okay, so just be aware of that. "
"395320","396780"," We've got a bunch of other stuff that we've never heard gas."
"397300","401860"," That's how a war I've talked about, uh, productivity, uh, inflation, all that kind of stuff at some"
"401860","402100"," point."
"402480","403340"," This is Friday's report. "
"403480","406880"," The rest of you really don't need to know, but you can see why we are where we are this"
"406880","408680"," morning on the open."
"409180","414220"," Now this morning, futures are trading, uh, near four, two, seven, five, which is off of the four,"
"414300","415500"," two, three, three, seven or eight lows."
"416300","421400"," Open interest changes from Friday's show, uh, from Friday's show, the neck closing of puts, right,"
"421840","425020"," is greater or equal to 4350 enrolled lower. "
"425860","428640"," Additionally, 20,000 calls added to 4400."
"428640","428960"," Okay."
"429020","430360"," So let's be aware of this number right here. "
"430720","433720"," We got a price target of that same old place, 4400."
"434120","436400"," Now there are some scarier resistance levels above."
"436940","441100"," We talked about, we'll look at a chart real quick and I'll say those, this serve to shift me of"
"441100","442400"," our key, key levels lower. "
"442740","446100"," Bulbs trigger, ABS, gamma strike call, which brings down resistance."
"448760","452220"," Uh, 4300 to 4400 is now overhead range into next week."
"452420","452560"," Okay. "
"452920","453920"," And that's what we're talking about here."
"454000","458500"," We'll look at that channel and see why this is going to be 4400 is actually me tough to hit."
"458860","463580"," For today, we see resistance at 4325 and 4345. "
"464300","465980"," Be aware of these two numbers here."
"466160","470700"," I have a chart it out and I posted that start on Twitter this morning on my regular handle on"
"470700","473520"," the Captain Jim James stand on the regular one of the captain's app up channel."
"473900","476120"," So you go back and look at my profile there and you'll find it. "
"477320","480500"," The report lies at 42 55 and 44 208."
"482120","487260"," Major oil moves plus greater than 5% are grabbing headlines and many other commodities are soaring"
"487260","487620"," too."
"488160","489060"," We talked about the week. "
"489360","492540"," Remember if you guys remember, we talked about week before it blew up, right?"
"493000","494760"," We said, wow, we don't ever see week calls."
"495140","501940"," And then we saw week calls as that, as the trade, uh, became apparent once Russia invaded Ukraine"
"501940","509320"," convex moves tend to break things margin calls for liquidations and a minimum keep pre-op FMC in"
"509320","510420"," certain high, right?"
"511780","513059"," What does this mean here?"
"513539","515600"," This means that you've got people trying to short oil."
"515780","516260"," It's not going to work. "
"516280","518320"," It's going to make keep continuous squeeze higher, right?"
"520400","526500"," If equities start to shift lower, we continue to see it as controlled demolition of steps lower as"
"526500","528860"," opposed to limit down type moves."
"529360","531720"," We see these staircase moves in the market right now, right?"
"531860","536580"," You can see larger moves in futures and then you see smaller downward moves in the cash market."
"537420","541000"," This is because we believe that there are substantial put options and so dealers are left to adjust"
"541000","542280"," hedges gamma. "
"543020","550400"," If some exogenous event drives a demand for additional put positions and negative deltas, any voice"
"550400","555120"," that are dealers, pads, which could drive volatility over."
"555640","561140"," Now we talked about this as well, where, where when we see these puts have been bought, these"
"561140","563480"," hedges have been bought, they're already in the market."
"563920","572720"," And until we get to specific resistance points, we don't really see more puts be purchased unless"
"572720","573540"," we're at those points. "
"574000","579110"," And every time we've come to those points, you've seen that implication of volatility from the"
"579110","580550"," addition of puts on the market."
"581050","587070"," And until retail traders, retail investors get bullish again, they're not going to see anything"
"587070","588270"," other than that take place."
"588950","593050"," So puts are our bearish sentiment and puts are running the market right now, okay?"
"593870","597530"," We're not seeing puts that are just way out, right?"
"597810","602270"," Hedging that's just way out in time in the money for us to head higher. "
"602510","607510"," You're seeing deep outside the money, deep in the money puts that are staggered one, two, three"
"607510","608010"," months out."
"608430","611030"," And then you're seeing a bunch of zero day puts being bought."
"611510","613370"," There's amplifying that move down. "
"613570","619330"," You're not seeing call buying, hedging higher one, two, three months out."
"619550","624330"," You're not seeing zero day calls being bought that are outside the money."
"624450","627410"," It's all inside the money stuff that's driving the market higher when we go higher. "
"628690","631690"," This is because that we believe that there are substantial put options."
"631690","633230"," So there's left to adjust gamma."
"633850","635710"," Well, we're talking about that at a higher level. "
"635870","638470"," We still we have still not shifted from the view."
"639050","641650"," The markets won't stage a major rally until next week."
"641670","644170"," I'm seeing OPEC barring a ceasefire. "
"644850","646790"," And I posted this on Twitter last Thursday too."
"646930","652070"," I think there's their Wednesday I posted, I said to you all it takes is a ceasefire like a real"
"652070","653270"," ceasefire, not a fake one."
"653750","656230"," None of this like you get a path out of there and anything like that. "
"656450","657050"," This is true."
"657470","662870"," If you see a real ceasefire like we're going to stop killing each other, you will see shorts get"
"662870","663110"," trapped."
"663550","666530"," At any point, no matter where we are on this market, you will see it guaranteed. "
"667650","667770"," Okay."
"668610","672830"," Then to next week, the lower markets are the stronger we anticipate the bounce made be."
"674830","676070"," This is next week, right?"
"676270","680850"," This is heading into the 12th, 11th, 12th somewhere in there. "
"680970","683310"," Look at the exactly I would expect that bounce, right?"
"683930","686850"," To happen maybe the 10th."
"687270","688230"," That's excuse me."
"688990","690190"," I would expect it to happen. "
"690770","691430"," Oh, I don't know."
"691770","692730"," It's a tough one."
"693790","697690"," That still includes where the FOMC is for next week. "
"698150","701010"," The lower the markets are, the stronger we anticipate the bounce may be."
"701570","702790"," Be aware of that part, right?"
"703230","704370"," We trade down deep."
"704610","705390"," I don't think that we do. "
"705790","706530"," Maybe we do."
"706910","712590"," But I think they're going to pin the unless they, unless they waterfall cascade put, I think they"
"712590","713010"," pin it."
"713450","718290"," But there should be a moment next week where we get a significant bounce on this market. "
"718510","718730"," Okay."
"719790","724510"," Prior to next week on the down side, we know two strong support lines, 4225, 4120."
"725750","731290"," You look for tradable bounces off those levels and more macro major support at 4050. "
"731930","733210"," Be conscious of this one too."
"733270","738610"," If you can't handle us going down to 4050 and you're a bull and you have no business trading this"
"738610","744090"," right now, if you're a bull, it might be better for you to just sit out and wait for that"
"744090","745390"," moment of capitulation."
"745470","746630"," It might never come. "
"747090","748610"," But even if it doesn't come, right?"
"749310","751150"," You can still bypass FOMC."
"751150","753750"," You can still bypass OPEX and get it at any time."
"754030","755550"," You don't need the best bottom. "
"755910","758210"," You don't need the ultimate bottom."
"758590","762090"," You just need some of this shit to smooth over if you're a bull out there."
"762550","766870"," If you're a patient bull, it might serve you well just to sit out and say, fuck it, if I"
"766870","769310"," get the 4050, I'm going to trade this higher. "
"769970","773470"," If I don't, in FOMC, OPEX is out of the way, I'm going long."
"774590","778690"," That's the safest play as a bull for you being out there."
"778790","784270"," Now, we're going to talk about us trading lower than this 4050 if there's that potential and there"
"784270","784450"," is. "
"785030","787670"," There really is and I'll talk about it later today."
"787950","788050"," Okay."
"788470","789650"," You got five minutes left until we open. "
"789650","792750"," I'm going to show this to you on a start here in a moment."
"793110","798890"," Conversely, upside resistance into 3.16 continues to read at 4440, right?"
"799630","801150"," I'll scroll through this for you."
"801510","807230"," You can come back and pause this video and get your own levels, if you like, on the different"
"807230","807870"," indexes. "
"808430","813170"," But there's some real weakness going on in other places in the market that we've talked about at"
"813170","813790"," some point today."
"814530","819110"," Now, later on, let's say this every time I come on here and say this, I go, I got some"
"819110","822050"," shit I got to do later today and then I end up sitting here with you till four o'clock,"
"822430","824350"," which it's possible that happens today as well."
"824810","831970"," I have to, I have some of the technical difficulties being on, being on our live streaming, what I"
"831970","833030"," want to live stream to you. "
"833190","835450"," I've got a new computer that I purchased last week."
"835450","836350"," It's in a shop."
"836890","837530"," I need to go pick it up. "
"837730","838470"," The weekend is over."
"839110","843210"," Yada, yada, all that other kind of shit to get this up and actually running the way that I want"
"843210","843810"," to see it running."
"844770","846090"," So we're going to get out of this real quick. "
"848930","858630"," And I posted this on, I posted this chart on to, to Twitter this morning, okay?"
"858870","862930"," And this is what I want you to see is this zone up here is your resistance zone, okay?"
"863910","866110"," Because this area is all volatility up here."
"866850","871350"," More than likely you're not going to trade higher by what Spock Amis saying your resistance today"
"871350","874170"," is, we got four, three, two, zero, right?"
"874650","876530"," So we could trade down right off the bell here."
"877690","881630"," And maybe we trade higher to four, three, five today somewhere in here, okay?"
"882190","886270"," So we kind of do this with a thing where we could end up trading right off the bell. "
"886390","892430"," We could trade down spook bulls and then actually trade higher into the close today."
"894710","897950"," Now we couldn't have getting more calls purchased in the bell, right?"
"898130","900690"," That would force dealers to sell futures, right?"
"900850","906290"," We come back down here and then we actually make a move up either Tuesday, we burn, we burn Tuesday"
"906290","910530"," calls, we actually make that move into Wednesday here before he hits more volatility."
"911170","912870"," That's that 440 zone, right?"
"913370","917670"," This kind of answers the question of what Spock Amis thinks we're going to do. "
"918170","924590"," If you're a bear, it doesn't really matter what we do in here doing into FOMC, you're just looking"
"924590","926790"," for the best spot to take a short position."
"927330","932170"," And that answers the other side of the Spock Amis take on this market, right?"
"932290","936670"," And no matter where we are up here, maybe taking a short into FOMC next week."
"937210","938270"," I don't care if it's a long put. "
"938490","939390"," I don't care what it is."
"939710","945830"," It's some kind of, hey, we're going down into the into the into this future zone over here."
"946070","947310"," They've got puts down a 390. "
"947790","951750"," They don't have puts at four, just four, five, four, eight, four, eighteen, they've got them down"
"951750","952090"," here."
"952550","953670"," And we can see these dates."
"954490","955750"," This is next week over here, right?"
"955910","962550"," We've got the 10th, we've got the 11th, 12th, before we put the 14th here and the 15th and 16th"
"962550","963690"," right down in here. "
"964590","966870"," So there's a fair chance that we can trade up here."
"967450","972450"," And you've got another short opportunity coming into next week right down here."
"972870","974070"," I mean, I don't know how we get there. "
"974770","977550"," This is basically what they're saying on the best case scenario."
"978150","983890"," This is your best case scenario from now into into following next week."
"984470","985010"," This is it. "
"985750","987310"," It's not we trade down here."
"987430","988550"," And then we rocket ship up."
"988950","993510"," This is your best chance for what could happen into next week. "
"995910","997730"," So we'll check out this open together."
"998330","1002750"," I'll bring up a book map for you, but I want you to see what the best case opportunity is"
"1002750","1006650"," to see, you know, what can what can happen here?"
"1006990","1007850"," Do we have a fake out?"
"1007850","1008550"," Do we have a fake out?"
"1008670","1009010"," We're at the bell."
"1009110","1010190"," We trade higher than we trade lower. "
"1010330","1013230"," We bounce maybe some don't somewhere down in here possible."
"1013730","1016190"," This possible could trade as low as four, two, eight, five, four."
"1016730","1021070"," But I think we I think we take the bounce off of four, three, one, eight, four somewhere in there. "
"1021450","1022910"," And then we start trading higher today."
"1023089","1024190"," I think you'll see the trade higher today."
"1024569","1027690"," Even if they burn calls, they're going to see the trade higher to mark Tuesday into Wednesday. "
"1027950","1031650"," We call buyers and put those put dollars on Friday Bell."
"1032030","1034210"," We'll check that out on the open this morning."
"1034490","1037550"," And the one last thing I want to show you is market profile before we get out of this. "
"1038290","1039710"," You were trading right now, right?"
"1040150","1042089"," There's a whole wall of sellers above here."
"1042089","1046530"," There's a giant iceberg to work through as we trade the rest of the day ahead."
"1046650","1046810"," Okay. "
"1046890","1051850"," So just be aware of this this morning that there's some resistance here and resistance at 4,400."
"1052070","1054070"," I know a lot of you are like, yeah, but there's nothing above cap."
"1054570","1056570"," We're going to trade with a rocket ship way higher here. "
"1056850","1057730"," I don't see that happening."
"1058610","1063610"," That's the less is the truth to cease fire, cease fire unless there's something we don't know."
"1064470","1065950"," These sellers are going to be up here. "
"1066350","1067990"," Just waiting to get out of their long position."
"1069090","1069490"," Okay."
"1070210","1075430"," Other things on this market that are going to log off there, we just hit the bell. "
"1076250","1078970"," They're going to impact the market."
"1079310","1082370"," And there's some things going on the background that you have to be aware of."
"1083010","1085750"," Turn this one off right here. "
"1085750","1087330"," Let me open up here."
"1087630","1087910"," Look at that."
"1090370","1091670"," I need a second here. "
"1091710","1092410"," I want to see this bell."
"1098220","1098760"," We'll see."
"1098820","1102880"," We'll see if we trade down off the bell here and a load up hook map. "
"1104660","1107360"," Maybe catch a nice bounce off 4,31 or so."
"1107620","1109400"," I think I called it at 4,31."
"1110100","1113320"," I mean, it was 4,30 or something like that. "
"1114620","1116280"," To get a bounce, we'll start trading higher."
"1123470","1125670"," And I haven't looked at your comments yet, so just give me a second."
"1125910","1128450"," I'll get to the comments and talk to you guys and tell you what's been going on. "
"1129470","1135250"," We'll talk about live streaming and that kind of stuff."
"1136810","1149740"," It's mostly that stuff is and it's mostly that"
"1149740","1150380"," things line up."
"1150680","1154940"," You know, you get like, I'm having live streaming problems and then I've got other stuff going on"
"1154940","1155360"," in my life. "
"1156100","1160260"," I've got a house that I have to work on and then I've got family that people start asking me"
"1160260","1161200"," to do all kinds of other stuff."
"1161760","1163320"," So that's kind of just it, right?"
"1163800","1165160"," So you can get back online again."
"1174610","1181410"," I also want to make a note too, if any of you guys out there, if you subscribe to spotgamma,"
"1183930","1187390"," if you subscribe to spotgamma, I'm looking for you. "
"1189470","1190830"," So spotgamma just launched."
"1191430","1193130"," They're launching a bunch of new stuff."
"1193770","1198790"," They're launching like this new hero indicator. "
"1201210","1202230"," I'm not a fan of it."
"1202390","1205470"," I don't know if you, let me know at some point, well, maybe we'll talk about this later if we"
"1205470","1211210"," take about reading your comments just yet, but I'm not a fan of the new hero indicator and"
"1211210","1213470"," definitely not the price that they're charging for it."
"1213970","1219470"," For what it offers, I'm kind of kind of scratching my head over it and it's implications. "
"1220210","1225190"," It's not helping for me at least."
"1225570","1232690"," I tried to look at it myself and I was kind of left scratching my head."
"1234010","1238650"," Let me know if you think, are you paying for that new service out there or not?"
"1238810","1241250"," I'm not a fan of it in its current state. "
"1241410","1241690"," That's weird."
"1241850","1246810"," They ran it for like a, they ran it for I think a day?"
"1247390","1249670"," No, maybe a week or so or something like that."
"1250290","1252310"," Maybe it was a week week and a half or something like that. "
"1252410","1253190"," I'm not a fan of it."
"1253270","1256950"," It was glitchy too even when they made it private again."
"1258310","1261290"," I get the same thing kind of here too enough here. "
"1261910","1262930"," This is more real time."
"1263150","1267490"," I don't know about, I don't know what that whole spotgamma thought process."
"1267990","1270570"," We got more buyers this size right now here and the indicator is green. "
"1271130","1273790"," Looks like those are going to try to step in at some point and buy this dip."
"1275270","1280670"," We can see right off the bell here, there's some support at 42893 and a little bit more support"
"1280670","1282230"," down here at 42985."
"1282690","1288460"," So make the be conscious of these levels down below here and see it here. "
"1289100","1291400"," A little bit more support here at 43069."
"1292560","1295960"," So more risk going to put on to ping risk up for tolerance."
"1297140","1301900"," You got some 43074, then you've got 42977. "
"1304140","1305940"," You got 42878."
"1307700","1309800"," We'll see if these levels hold up here."
"1309960","1313220"," We can grab a dip down here and trade this together this morning. "
"1314980","1320020"," So I got here for some levels 42977, hold on, I got to snap some lines."
"1327920","1330280"," You guys think I only live stream you guys."
"1331500","1335780"," I actually trade this myself the same way that I talk to you guys 42879. "
"1343790","1345110"," That's not a bad area down there."
"1345770","1349670"," I got 149777 and then I got 42878."
"1351430","1353210"," Some people say to you, we're going to trade a lot. "
"1353310","1358050"," Some people will tell you they'll be like, hey, we're trading all the way down to 42433."
"1359170","1360190"," I'll be honest with you."
"1360550","1366310"," I have if you look at my account right now, what I'm holding, it's fucking crazy. "
"1367290","1368510"," Like I've got calls."
"1369370","1373450"," I had I owned some snow stock last week."
"1375070","1377210"," I have some I have put spreads. "
"1377630","1387390"," I got so I've got a I've got a 430s that expire in four"
"1387390","1387750"," days."
"1387870","1389450"," They expire on Friday."
"1390050","1391650"," I've got some 430 peas. "
"1393770","1394550"," That's all they are."
"1394670","1396010"," They're 429430 peas."
"1396930","1400250"," All we have to do is close on Friday below 430. "
"1400810","1402950"," That shows my faith in this market right now."
"1404110","1408830"," So I've even got put spreads out there just protecting the downside."
"1409170","1410470"," Even if we trade higher, it doesn't matter. "
"1411350","1417970"," I think I've had these for a week or two, but since early last week, and so even if we"
"1417970","1423350"," trade higher, they they print at some point whether they print 10%, 20%, 50%."
"1423350","1428190"," It doesn't really matter to me, because I'm grabbing them on the highs, right?"
"1428810","1433590"," Like you should too, even if you're taking long positions right now, you can you can literally take"
"1433590","1437990"," put spreads and they just print they just print eventually."
"1438430","1442790"," It doesn't matter if you hold if you hold them for like a week to two weeks, at some point"
"1442790","1443450"," they fucking print. "
"1444170","1446010"," It's it's shocking to say that, but it's true."
"1447730","1450030"," So we're gonna we're gonna look right here no matter."
"1450090","1450670"," Yeah, no matter what. "
"1450730","1455570"," And that that was the other video that I posted on Twitter this morning was a video about how you"
"1455570","1458530"," can long this market that was posted over the weekend."
"1458610","1460970"," And that's the same shit that I've been telling you guys."
"1461290","1467470"," You can't take a one or a three month call out there and expect it to print in this volatility"
"1467470","1470050"," environment that this regime that we're in right now. "
"1470310","1473210"," You just can't you can take zero dates, one dates, two dates."
"1473990","1478390"," You can marathon snow sold off deeply after their ER."
"1479130","1483710"," And I bought the bottom on their ER right bottle like a stupid low. "
"1484210","1489190"," And then one I think it was like 186 or something insane, 188."
"1489450","1493630"," I don't know, but it was weird because I held it into the next day."
"1494170","1497850"," And in my mind, I'm like, this was like a normal time. "
"1498010","1500950"," If this was the past couple of years, I could have bought that and I wouldn't have given a shit"
"1500950","1504190"," to trade slightly down over the next week or a month."
"1504670","1510710"," But right now, like, if it goes up 40 bucks in two days, a stock goes up 40 bucks in"
"1510710","1511030"," two days."
"1511490","1518470"," I can't fucking keep holding that because it could still go into the we've seen it like ask you,"
"1518490","1520210"," we've seen it all over the place, right?"
"1520550","1522270"," Hey, pal, it didn't matter what it was. "
"1522410","1527150"," Even if you got a bounce, you saw the shorts come in and pin that stock so it doesn't participate."
"1527950","1532650"," And then it winds up taking one, three, six months or a year for it to correct, right, to go"
"1532650","1534210"," in an actual corrective corrective move."
"1534790","1537730"," So right now you can't really do that in this market, right?"
"1537850","1542750"," Now you kind of have to be targeting what you're trying with the move. "
"1543230","1547270"," And that puts more risk on than a bull likes to do, right?"
"1547610","1549770"," Bulls don't want to have time, time to move."
"1550210","1554490"," They don't want to have to actually manage their present actively manage their positions out there."
"1554610","1561070"," And that's what they're if you take a one month or a three month call, this is even the worst"
"1561070","1561390"," part. "
"1561810","1566190"," Let's say you take a one month or a three month safety call and it's moving in your direction,"
"1566510","1566550"," right?"
"1566950","1567570"," Directly moving."
"1568070","1569230"," What are you skimming off the top?"
"1569430","1569870"," 10%."
"1569870","1571410"," You can't pay taxes. "
"1571810","1573990"," You can't get two or three bad moves."
"1573990","1575770"," Let's say you make 10 trades."
"1576490","1581430"," Let's say you're kick ass on those 10 trades and you only make 10 percent off each one of those"
"1581430","1581950"," 10 trades. "
"1582630","1583330"," 10%, right?"
"1583970","1586090"," Your taxes alone are going to eat you."
"1586090","1587330"," They're going to murder you."
"1587570","1593770"," You have to have like three, four, five of those trades print 100, 200, 300% believe it or not. "
"1594270","1600610"," And have just one bad one bad trade in there not be right up fucking side down in that trade."
"1601270","1607070"," So there's a lot of there's a lot of shit going on the market that is stopping those trades from"
"1607070","1608110"," happening out there."
"1608850","1613790"," And in reality, the only thing you can do is you can buy some call spreads on a on a"
"1613790","1614350"," huge bottom. "
"1614350","1620130"," You can buy some stock on a bottom and only hold it long enough to take that profit."
"1620970","1627270"," You can only buy a zero date or a one date or the closest expiring date in this market because"
"1627270","1630450"," of currently where we are right now in this market."
"1630450","1630950"," It's wild. "
"1631470","1638350"," I don't know if you're every hope all of you understand all that that concept of the restraint or"
"1638350","1643210"," like hand cuffs that are put on bulls out there currently in this market."
"1643210","1650290"," It goes from owning stock to trying to buy options, at least in the cash market, right?"
"1651130","1654410"," Just trying to hold all doesn't matter if it's one or three months out."
"1654750","1655390"," You can't. "
"1655950","1657210"," I know you can't."
"1657550","1660990"," And it was explained that it was explained in that video quite eloquently."
"1661090","1666050"," But in truth, it in truth we're waiting for some news to be out of the way. "
"1666170","1669830"," So if you're a bull, you can trade this hard and fast."
"1670070","1673250"," You can trade it like a cowboy, a gun slinger, whatever."
"1673810","1678710"," If you're that good, if you're not, then what you are doing is you're selling tops. "
"1679150","1680190"," You have to sell tops."
"1680710","1685650"," You have to you have to not fight the flow in weight."
"1685950","1689870"," You got to wait until you eat some clarity on this bullshit FMC, right?"
"1690590","1693270"," And we also have headline events that are really bad right now. "
"1693350","1696470"," We've got oil and gas and wheat."
"1696970","1700730"," You got people I have stopped people yesterday talking about how we're selling all of our wheat"
"1700730","1701070"," reserves."
"1701970","1704650"," And you know, all that panic, it's real. "
"1704990","1706230"," You can't say that it's not real."
"1706710","1711510"," You can't say that the I can't say the feds not back into a corner to work on inflation."
"1712170","1715170"," Because if they weren't before, right, they are right fucking now. "
"1715610","1716910"," No matter what you can."
"1717090","1721530"," Oh, here we go and make an actual bounce over."
"1721690","1724010"," We're going to bounce even lower to 427 here. "
"1725070","1730250"," It looks like our first bounce is on that line that I first pointed out to you this morning, right?"
"1730410","1738630"," I said 429.77 and 428.78. We'll see if this holds here or if we continue to trade down."
"1739050","1741510"," I might I'm maybe taking a call with you here at some point."
"1741890","1745910"," This is a good place to take a call, believe it or not, and start averaging in if we trade"
"1745910","1746290"," lower. "
"1747050","1752070"," We could possibly trade lower here down to 428 or even lower down below here."
"1752070","1754050"," So I'm going to wait and see here for a minute."
"1754450","1757470"," But the point is this is that coming in FOMC, right?"
"1757910","1762930"," And you got the Fed, you got you got Jay Powell saying, hey, we're doing 25 basis points. "
"1763750","1765850"," You got you know, all kinds of randos shit out there."
"1765850","1770490"," You've got Hey, we're going we're going to every single FOM season and then get 25 basis points."
"1772610","1777850"," All this noise and they've literally been they they always react fucking late, right?"
"1778110","1782650"," And then they put their fucking late to the party once the party gets started on the other side of"
"1782650","1783310"," that trade, right?"
"1783690","1786970"," You know that the the gas trade, that's a whole nother. "
"1787010","1792470"," I could do I could probably do like a two hour show just on the gas trade and why the"
"1792470","1797410"," gas trade is where it's at and has not I heard somebody say it's because of the politics heard"
"1797410","1802970"," somebody say it's because of fucking like the US set this up in the UN and NATO set this up"
"1802970","1805130"," years ago, blah, blah, blah."
"1805130","1806910"," I've heard all kinds of fucking noise about that."
"1807170","1815830"," And the reality is the fucking gas trade and the oil trade sucked since since uh since uh uh uh"
"1815830","1819430"," fucking February March when Corona first started of point 20. "
"1820650","1823450"," There's a lot of juice there, right?"
"1823630","1824990"," So they're going to use whatever they can."
"1825450","1831850"," Believe it or not, this isn't even conspiracy theory that in that's the that's the gold trade,"
"1832550","1832910"," right?"
"1833070","1837950"," But it flips into the ruble and the buying of gold by other by foreign powers."
"1838490","1840890"," A lot of this stuff people are like why is it why do these things happen?"
"1841090","1843150"," Why does war happen and things like this?"
"1843370","1846530"," This is this has been set up for two years. "
"1846950","1855870"," If you've been following me on Twitter for two years repeatedly repeatedly I keep saying I've been"
"1855870","1864870"," saying on Twitter for two years eventually there's going to be a war eventually there always is"
"1864870","1871910"," well it when times like this there always is and of course we've got one and we got one believe"
"1871910","1876690"," it or not because it greed it has more to do with money than anything else and when you get"
"1876690","1883870"," that lens of uh of market uh dynamics right and how they impact uh world events believe it or not"
"1883870","1887050"," you think the world events are driving like to wag the dog right?"
"1887550","1890030"," The wag the dog isn't political the wag the dog is money."
"1891250","1895510"," We can disagree upon this but we're going to do a show about this down the road here and I'm"
"1895510","1899770"," going to point out all these key things how these things happen uh in market."
"1900010","1902370"," Do you see us even how the politicians are reacting?"
"1903130","1903850"," I would expect the same. "
"1904610","1909690"," I would expect the same from both parties that has more to do with money than anything else."
"1909930","1912970"," Does nobody get no one fucking cares about politics?"
"1913370","1915370"," Only main Joe Main Street cares about politics."
"1916830","1918890"," So we'll talk about that in a later point. "
"1919530","1923810"," We are trading right down right still right down right now to this 4, 2, 8, 6, 9 level."
"1924110","1930670"," We'll see if this holds or if we actually trade down to this 4, 2, 7.92. I still have"
"1930670","1933150"," not taken a trade an active trade at this moment."
"1933410","1935850"," I'm actually going to probably close some puts out here. "
"1936570","1942330"," I've got some uh let's take a look at my I'm gonna have to go my put spreads here and"
"1942330","1955370"," probably take some profit off the table here because people still want them right"
"1955370","1955810"," here."
"1970450","1972230"," So we'll see if anybody wants to buy some puts."
"1973350","1974570"," I got puts for sale. "
"1976530","1977790"," Anybody want to buy some puts?"
"1977990","1979390"," Oh you bears out there come on my puts."
"1983840","1984720"," Buy my puts."
"1987970","1989410"," Come buy my put. "
"1989570","1990090"," Don't do that."
"1990330","1991150"," Don't take along here."
"1991330","1992750"," Buy my puts first so I can take along. "
"1993610","1995470"," Get real super uber-duper bearish."
"1995550","1995990"," Don't do that."
"1996270","1996770"," Don't bounce. "
"1999430","1999930"," Don't bounce."
"2001870","2004130"," And there's that beautiful bounce right?"
"2004450","2005890"," You're watching that beautiful bounce right now."
"2006090","2008530"," Hopefully it bounces and keeps going down slightly. "
"2009550","2010770"," I want you to buy my puts."
"2012150","2014250"," Buy my puts please."
"2017550","2018750"," The tankers are green. "
"2019490","2020330"," Good morning everybody."
"2023250","2027440"," This is where I want it."
"2027540","2029460"," This is where I want to bear to buy my puts right in here. "
"2032150","2032870"," Come on down."
"2033210","2034030"," Come down and buy my put."
"2035550","2036830"," Get uber-duper bearish. "
"2036970","2037850"," Buy my puts from me."
"2040330","2041450"," Please buy my puts."
"2046390","2047590"," Oh yeah here we go. "
"2048070","2048370"," Come on."
"2050810","2052409"," This sucks about spreads."
"2057130","2058929"," They're always skimming on spreads. "
"2061940","2065159"," They get the- especially if you want like this is the price that you want to spread."
"2069969","2072030"," Probably gonna have to make them slightly more tasty."
"2073570","2074389"," I think I'm gonna fill here. "
"2074610","2074790"," Hold on."
"2079030","2083610"," I think I'm gonna- think I'm gonna spread is- there's always a little bit on each"
"2083610","2092270"," side you There you go."
"2092929","2094230"," Fill my spreads baby. "
"2095210","2095909"," Come on."
"2102830","2104990"," Come on they're through they're so right there."
"2106790","2107990"," Fill my put spreads. "
"2110570","2115190"," Well I'm probably gonna have to- I think it even more enticing."
"2124260","2125260"," God kidding me."
"2127810","2131250"," I might have even missed the first- I always like to get these things filled. "
"2131510","2131950"," Oh there we go."
"2132170","2132490"," Bam."
"2133370","2133810"," Filled. "
"2134010","2135550"," Thank you very much for playing."
"2138130","2140150"," I just sold some put spreads here."
"2142110","2144690"," And we'll see if we actually trade down from this moment. "
"2144750","2146230"," I'm probably gonna take a long here."
"2146650","2148690"," I did get some bear out there just bought my puts."
"2148950","2149670"," They thought they were cheap. "
"2149870","2152030"," There's more more to be filled here."
"2152390","2158430"," We'll take a little bit lower here and see if there's more room to trade down lower."
"2159150","2160570"," We'll see where the bulls are. "
"2161650","2168850"," We can see there's somewhere up in here 4.26.50. 4.26.50 you can see this nice volume"
"2168850","2169530"," down here."
"2169990","2179890"," You also have got some banks filling down here at 4.25. We'll take a look at the here indicator."
"2180490","2181850"," It doesn't always work well. "
"2185390","2187890"," Here indicators lightly trading higher."
"2188130","2190530"," We're gonna also take a look at XLU."
"2192110","2192710"," XLF. "
"2194150","2196310"," Yeah, XLU is catching a bid right now."
"2196950","2200170"," You should take a look at XLU on your own trading app."
"2200890","2201750"," XLP we'll look at. "
"2202690","2203290"," XLV."
"2203930","2206330"," Ooh, XLP trading on down."
"2211050","2211950"," Look at healthcare. "
"2213270","2215870"," City healthcare is basically getting a big catch in a short bid."
"2216310","2216950"," Not a big one."
"2218510","2222150"," XLF is selling off right now. "
"2222290","2222870"," That's not good."
"2223070","2223970"," You don't want to be seeing that."
"2225190","2226010"," XLF is weird. "
"2226230","2228350"," XLU is catching a bid but XLF is not."
"2228970","2231570"," It's not good for the market internals currently at this moment."
"2231770","2232970"," We'll keep an eye on XLF. "
"2233550","2240670"," As a matter of fact, they're right at a line that I have snapped here at 36.53. I can't"
"2240670","2246410"," wait to have this new computer up and running because I can flip below and show you guys previous"
"2246410","2249610"," sports that I've put in the market."
"2249610","2256730"," I can switch out of this book map and show you some areas, some contentious areas for the market."
"2257750","2263170"," In 36, right where we are right now specifically, if you guys are open up an XLF chart for, I"
"2263170","2266370"," don't know, six months or so, maybe even a year. "
"2267150","2268790"," You can really see the cost."
"2269830","2277470"," I was talking this morning but I think you even posted on Twitter about, are we near a market-trash"
"2277940","2282190"," scenario and we are, believe it or not."
"2283290","2291590"," There are some places in the market that if you look that are very dangerous in the equities"
"2291590","2298420"," market, they're showing elsewhere in other markets and bonds, it's showing in commodities. "
"2299240","2304100"," If you look at XLF right now, right where it's at, at 36.50, right over here."
"2304860","2309360"," You know another one that shows it really well is Amazon showing it."
"2310160","2313540"," Amazon is showing a place in the market. "
"2314000","2322000"," Let's say you go back, I think I was looking at NQ yesterday, right?"
"2322500","2332440"," I was comparing NQ and the spy and then I compared the two of them to Amazon"
"2334100","2342860"," and I was looking back to, let's say we had a market-trash in spy because you look"
"2342860","2350520"," at a company of 2020, Lowe's basically."
"2351120","2354940"," Amazon is, if you bring up a chart for Amazon with you real quick, right?"
"2357280","2361140"," If you look at a chart right now, it's probably like a one-year chart and then push it down"
"2362660","2363600"," to like a two-year."
"2364900","2368300"," And if you look where it's sitting right now, sitting on 28, 77, 55. "
"2368300","2376740"," And if you look back to roughly October,"
"2377200","2381900"," September, you look back on July, right?"
"2384400","2389280"," And then if you were to look at NDX, NASDAQ, right?"
"2390340","2398520"," NASDAQ is still not back to these Lowe's relevant to where Amazon is."
"2398520","2409540"," And the point is that if you were to bring NASDAQ to it October 2020, just October, October"
"2409540","2410960"," 2020 Lowe's, right?"
"2411640","2418120"," You'd probably have a fall in Amazon down to 2000, believe it or not."
"2418740","2427600"," Probably dropped to like 2,900 down to roughly 2000, which would be a brutal move. "
"2428320","2431300"," Maybe 2,200, maybe 2,000, something like that."
"2431840","2436320"," So I'm looking at the interplay of these tickers in this general market here."
"2436520","2438500"," What would need to take place for us to have a market-trash?"
"2439700","2441160"," Why are we trading where we are?"
"2441700","2444300"," The levels that we're on in this market. "
"2444820","2448270"," If you look right now in Amazon, it's double tapping."
"2450450","2454830"," A huge support area, the bottom end of a huge support area."
"2455630","2463510"," And we have all these things going on outside of the equities market that are telling you and"
"2463510","2466270"," telegraphing to you that we're at that moment. "
"2467290","2477220"," If you saw a breakdown of NASDAQ just to October of 2020,"
"2477880","2481660"," you would see tickers."
"2482420","2486520"," The main ones that are holding the market up are pretty much the ones that haven't been knocked"
"2486520","2487040"," down yet."
"2488500","2496040"," You could see some blood in the street that could take the NASDAQ down and in turn the spy down"
"2496040","2496920"," as well. "
"2497680","2499020"," That's some very low numbers."
"2500100","2506860"," I don't know if that happens where we are currently, but I've been looking at it for the past few"
"2506860","2513120"," days here and I'm bouncing between all this stuff, trying to find the answer to that question."
"2516020","2517860"," There's a lot of stuff that has to happen. "
"2518000","2518860"," I'd press to get there."
"2519060","2522020"," Of course, you'd have to trade down to 4050 to trade back."
"2522200","2528740"," Or 418 or so, or 420, then you'd close below a certain number, then you'd get down to the 4050,"
"2528740","2530720"," 500, then you'd close below a certain number. "
"2531840","2536160"," You'd trade down even lower, but then there's a point of no return is my point."
"2536940","2544380"," If you look at Amazon, take a one-year chart, push it down, take a few cents, push, condense it"
"2544380","2547960"," down to a fewer chart on a charting software."
"2548280","2549020"," I'm telling you, right?"
"2549220","2555440"," If you look at Amazon and there's a few other tickers, major tickers in this market, that if they"
"2555440","2557280"," start to trade lower, right?"
"2557760","2564000"," If they start to break major support, and they do trade down, like 2000, you start to be an Apple"
"2564000","2565820"," sell-off at a big way. "
"2566220","2568380"," You see a Tesla sell-off in a big way."
"2568860","2576560"," You start to see some of these major market impact, impact stock tickers."
"2577980","2579680"," There could be a large move down. "
"2580000","2582740"," There could be a large move down that'll be quick fast."
"2583800","2588740"," I know Spock Emma is saying you're seeing step-to-step steps down, but there are trigger points"
"2588740","2591780"," within this market that could send it into a free fall."
"2597570","2607010"," I'm trying to think, it's one thing to say, it's COVID, so we've got the Fed put for it, and"
"2607010","2609030"," sometimes you can't use the Fed put. "
"2609310","2611290"," Sometimes the Fed put doesn't work."
"2611930","2616010"," You've got a complete sell-the-news type environment to the market."
"2616210","2618190"," You've got a complete sell-the-market. "
"2620390","2628350"," I'm just trying to be aware of that as we create forward here and see if there's potential for that"
"2628350","2628890"," to take place."
"2629750","2633470"," That would be outside market impact, right?"
"2634390","2636150"," Just a quick bounce down below here."
"2636370","2639810"," Basically bounce down at that 42878 level, right?"
"2640090","2641810"," We saw the first bounce at 4297. "
"2642770","2646430"," We saw you the second bounce now below here at 42878."
"2646890","2654010"," I sold puts down below here, and if you're going to take along, we'll see if we get some resistance"
"2654010","2655150"," here at 4297."
"2656110","2660570"," If we don't, and it doesn't turn around, we should trade higher. "
"2663570","2671370"," We'll look to see here, if this bounce holds, we'll see if these sellers can be absorbed and we can"
"2671370","2672410"," trade higher from this point."
"2684160","2691760"," Yeah, there's some mechanics in the market, some internals in the market that can be overridden,"
"2692500","2692840"," right?"
"2693020","2694980"," They can be overridden by outside influences."
"2697890","2703270"," Seeing a little bit of resistance at that same level above 4297, almost to the pin, right?"
"2704190","2709270"," We'll see if this holds or if we catch another second or third bounce, we'll take a long here in"
"2709270","2709770"," just a minute. "
"2710270","2713530"," We'll see if we can get one, two, like a one, two, three set up and take this long."
"2714650","2719290"," We'll wait for this rotation to take place."
"2719870","2724210"," We'll try to catch one of these longs higher here and see if it works. "
"2727230","2729990"," Yeah, XLE is banging, wheat's banging."
"2730190","2731890"," Matter of fact, I haven't even looked at wheat yet at this point."
"2733510","2737070"," USO has been banging and made some money on USO last week. "
"2738210","2743630"," I want to show you guys something on, I'm going to post something right now for you on, I want"
"2743630","2749950"," to show you guys here, I'm going to post something to Twitter for you to look at."
"2750790","2758690"," Why are you guys to be aware of, I don't know, how many years have you guys been fading energy?"
"2760270","2761790"," That's my first question."
"2764030","2770430"," I want to talk to you guys about something with oil. "
"2772750","2783620"," I'm going to show you, I want to show"
"2783620","2785660"," you guys something here in the past, okay?"
"2787380","2790740"," Not just oil, I want to show you something here, okay?"
"2791020","2792960"," It's going right back to 2008."
"2804280","2814160"," Oil's not the best, not the best correlation to our stock market."
"2822500","2829640"," Let's see this one here, and I want to show you"
"2853860","2864730"," this, just a"
"2864730","2865210"," second here. "
"2866530","2907900"," I think"
"2907900","2908720"," it's better here."
"2924840","2926500"," I'm afraid, I'm afraid this."
"2929580","2938430"," Oh man, they got a spice on them. "
"2938510","2944030"," I shouldn't have sold those put, I should have waited, but I had 50% on them, so I'm happy"
"2944030","2944610"," enough with them."
"2949840","2955240"," Good thing it didn't, good thing it didn't grab that long there on 428 either, 4285."
"2956400","2958100"," You see that nice failure right there. "
"2958460","2960360"," Holy shit, thankfully it didn't take them."
"2990530","3000430"," Yeah, still seeing a bounce on XLS, XLU is starting to roll, or it looks like it's being a"
"3000430","3010340"," little bit of a base here, XLU is ripping as well, XLE, XLU, Amazon is selling off right"
"3010340","3024520"," now, selling off the 2846, 22, 2771,"
"3024880","3031760"," 21 was the last low back on the 24th of February, on Amazon."
"3032820","3036340"," I want to see where the low was on January. "
"3037320","3052060"," Low on January was 2707, but"
"3052060","3054800"," it was a bounce on Amazon down here at 2845."
"3096760","3098920"," It's pretty ugly right now, so I'm still looking"
"3104330","3121370"," at spy"
"3121370","3124990"," calls coming, up position and wheat as well, that we've not doing as well today."

"4956230","4958850"," Someone's saying the wheat price is about to explode."
"4974480","4983140"," Wheat says the fund had only 7.37 my 5 million shares registered with the SEC available for"
"4983140","4983620"," purchase. "
"4984080","4986100"," Yeah, so why not just let it trade fucking higher?"
"4986860","4987820"," That's my question."
"5008570","5009910"," You can't run out of shares."
"5012910","5019050"," I'm assuming that we all own the wheat shares because none of us are selling. "
"5020230","5021950"," They're not going to raise the price of wheat."
"5027430","5027990"," It's ridiculous."
"5034090","5037490"," As someone here is asking, is the make it more or less value premium?"
"5040770","5047490"," American middle sanction related to Russia and the London bullion market association suspending"
"5047490","5050610"," accreditation of six Russian gold refiners. "
"5052170","5055650"," Yeah, we're going to talk about gold and Russia."
"5057390","5058690"," They're buying the gold."
"5058950","5059850"," Does everybody know that out there?"
"5059950","5061090"," The rush was buying all the gold. "
"5064930","5068750"," I'll kind of look to see if anyone's got an answer as to whether wheat's going to go up or"
"5068750","5070170"," I'm going to get fucked here in the state."
"5073690","5079790"," And gold prices move modestly higher on this report that the London bullion market association is"
"5079790","5082510"," spending accreditation of Russian gold refineries."
"5091170","5094470"," I'm still in some spy calls there. "
"5094470","5096530"," Keep adding to my position in spy."
"5099350","5100950"," I'm still a believer in spy."
"5102730","5103490"," We'll see. "
"5104590","5112330"," I should have held my put threads a little bit longer, but I had them for, I think it was"
"5112330","5113610"," Thursday at the bottom."
"5115270","5117690"," So I'm happy enough with the trade."
"5122690","5123890"," They made enough money. "
"5129840","5133180"," My Uber trade, I'm not concerned with my Uber trade."
"5133180","5138300"," If I had a trade that I'm concerned with right now, I'm concerned with my Uber trade for May."
"5144350","5152270"," I have that whole market crash concern the feedback of my mind, but my real concern is that this is"
"5152270","5154870"," more distribution in fucking Uber. "
"5157570","5161850"," So I have to unfuck myself from Uber at some point."
"5162090","5165970"," If there's another one of these moments in the market where I can sell up at an open."
"5167790","5173770"," I have a feeling that this call buying has nothing to do with taking it long. "
"5174570","5179510"," It only has to do with selling out of some long stock positions in Uber."
"5182900","5193360"," Still in store in this beautiful giant bull flag right now, but"
"5193360","5197300"," at the same time it could fucking sell down to like 15 bucks or something."
"5197300","5202280"," It could lose another what 50% of its value before it actually spiked. "
"5205330","5208090"," So it's a risky trade that I'm in right now."
"5209610","5211070"," The Uber trade for me."
"5213780","5218120"," This could just be, it just could be more distribution selling. "
"5228300","5232500"," XLU still getting a nice, a nice catching a nice bid this morning."
"5232800","5237820"," XLU, XLE still catching a nice bid this morning."
"5239640","5242520"," I don't like XLF still rolling over this morning. "
"5246020","5247860"," XLV catching a bid now."
"5248660","5250040"," XLP catching a bid."
"5259410","5262870"," Man, you know the market looks like dog shit right now. "
"5263810","5264530"," Not gonna lie."
"5267120","5269260"," Trying to peruse through a bunch of different tickers here."
"5269880","5274680"," One that freaks me out the most is watching J&K. "
"5278290","5284250"," I'm not, I use J&K as like a red flag warning on the market."
"5285910","5322330"," And I'm not fucking like it down here at $1.240. Arcade"
"5322330","5326270"," has given back everything since February 24th as well."
"5334340","5338160"," BTU, you with a huge sell off on dilution news. "
"5341660","5344240"," That's only back to what I was trading at yesterday."
"5346600","5350660"," This is my concern with BTU trading this low."
"5351660","5353540"," Something like this happening to wheat. "
"5354080","5357100"," Could be another good buy in to BTU at some point."
"5358840","5362660"," I'd really like to buy it down at like 17 or 18 again."
"5366070","5367770"," Wheat's back on, oh yeah baby. "
"5368730","5371270"," Wheat's trading again, it's now up a dollar."
"5372350","5374290"," 9% fuck yeah."
"5375650","5380150"," Oh yeah, baby, wheat, wheat, baby. "
"5380290","5381550"," You guys watching wheat right now?"
"5382590","5383070"," Yeah."
"5386620","5389640"," Now everybody knows that there's a wheat shortage, right?"
"5389960","5391580"," Our China's claiming that there is one."
"5392020","5393700"," They're going to create a wheat shortage. "
"5395260","5398160"," And you've got wheat saying we don't have any more shares."
"5401700","5405020"," That they were halted breaking news that they don't have any more shares to sell."
"5405550","5408160"," Wheat now trading to 1183, 1185. "
"5412000","5415200"," I got to look at the wheat trade again."
"5416000","5417560"," I might have to buy some wheat calls."
"5418700","5419980"," Hold on here. "
"5424090","5424950"," The wheat fund."
"5426010","5428110"," It's like Phuip wheat."
"5430090","5431790"," The March 18th. "
"5434070","5438650"," March 18th, 12th season, only $1.95. Yeah, it's not that good."
"5439890","5447670"," We get to like 15 dollars or the Wall Street best boy is going to trade this up today."
"5449450","5451490"," I might take a stab at it. "
"5452610","5457230"," I've got some shares, but I might take a stab at 15."
"5458990","5462910"," I'm going to keep an eye on it here and see if we can see if we can get some"
"5462910","5463750"," calls on wheat."
"5465930","5471770"," It was trading down to 11, 11, so we'll see if we can grab some calls here as well. "
"5474520","5476700"," See if wheat becomes a meme stock here."
"5482040","5483840"," Hold on here boys and girls."
"5485380","5485840"," Easy. "
"5487360","5488200"," I'm probably going to burn."
"5490160","5492140"," I'm probably going to burn a bunch of money here."
"5494200","5499300"," I'm looking at, I probably shouldn't buy 15. "
"5499300","5505920"," There's not a lot of interest there for the 18th, but we get a week and a half, right?"
"5506920","5508320"," I feel like a week and a half."
"5509480","5512660"," Most of the interest is on 12c for the 18th."
"5516370","5522940"," I'm going to look to see if we can grab a buy in here. "
"5523080","5526940"," If I'm going to bring wheat up right now, damn it, I don't want to lose my, I'm going to"
"5526940","5528860"," close my spy calls here in a minute."
"5530140","5534640"," Because I don't want to be, I don't want to be trading both, especially if we're going to get"
"5534640","5534920"," crazy."
"5543050","5545630"," We're going to look up wheat real quick and see where support is. "
"5554110","5555870"," It's like quit, right?"
"5560150","5561690"," Wait for me, buddy."
"5565480","5569980"," I think this wheat trade can be wrong in this part."
"5571840","5576440"," We'll see if there's actually less, like it looks like there's still stuff from the sellers. "
"5577420","5578420"," It'll be cautious here."
"5598140","5599500"," More sellers and buyers."
"5607360","5609060"," Nice brick and shelf, 1140. "
"5613840","5615200"," The original one's wheat."
"5623050","5624670"," I can't even buy these."
"5625030","5627790"," I'm going to attempt, there's that there were a dollar for a minute. "
"5643960","5701880"," It's not showing, it's not showing that getting some, we're"
"5701880","5705400"," watching these, watching wheat 15 C's."
"5705840","5707180"," They're kind of going wild."
"5707420","5710100"," They're like a dollar five and a dollar 20, then a dollar 30. "
"5717310","5721090"," I don't like there's more sellers than buyers right now on it either."
"5722450","5723890"," Don't just keep an eye on wheat."
"5724410","5737130"," I own the underlying, but I don't own some"
"5737130","5739150"," weird price action right now. "
"5739870","5744050"," I want to buy some calls."
"5748020","5748860"," Give it a minute."
"5749180","5751520"," I want to see if it will calm down here for a minute. "
"5758230","5760250"," Pimas on wheat here and see."
"5760610","5761310"," I don't like when it trades."
"5761510","5767550"," I don't like when any ticker is suspended. "
"5768770","5770610"," Play a rips and then it trades back."
"5771430","5773850"," It gives it all back and then it actually trades higher later."
"5779430","5782890"," Yeah, Nasdaq down 271 points right now. "
"5783930","5791000"," Man, brutal watch in the market right now."
"5791480","5793480"," I get out of wheat."
"5805960","5807600"," Nasdaq down 300 points. "
"5808460","5814460"," Implication today was that the market should have had higher today on some good news, but it looks"
"5814460","5816900"," like it's just still bad news dominating."
"5816900","5821100"," Looks like commodities still dominating the market."
"5821100","5823740"," There's some real risk off potential in the market. "
"5824020","5829420"," I labeled this live stream market crash seriously."
"5830280","5837740"," That's the label that I put on this live pass this morning because of where we are in the market"
"5837740","5843100"," and how close we actually are to a risk off type event."
"5843100","5845660"," Now, I didn't make my own self. "
"5845660","5848220"," I figured that we'd be trading up here this morning off the bell."
"5849120","5857700"," Now that we've probably trade up to 433, 430 or 440 possibly by tomorrow, maybe catch up bounce"
"5857700","5861460"," down here at I think we were looking at 429 and 428."
"5862680","5864800"," So far we've traded all the way down to 425, 52. "
"5865200","5868940"," I think that it's still down here at like it's even lower still."
"5869060","5871770"," It's like 425 or something like that."
"5871770","5875230"," We'll take a look at that as the spy loads up currently. "
"5875710","5877310"," But I've got still have some real concern."
"5878150","5884230"," I'm looking at some other tickers that aren't driving right now."
"5884910","5886190"," Like J&K is not driving. "
"5887570","5893890"," J&K is showing weakness in risk and risk appetite."
"5894710","5897890"," So it's now still it's trading on a dollar to 40."
"5898710","5900590"," But I don't like seeing it. "
"5900890","5904950"," I don't like seeing it trading lower here."
"5905590","5912530"," Watching some puts come in on Wells Fargo company, VA, XOM, right?"
"5912910","5920670"," Zoom puts him in on rig, the spy at the same time puts coming in on airlines, puts coming in"
"5920670","5922350"," on CSX on transportation."
"5922350","5926550"," Just across the board puts right now on the market. "
"5926950","5928890"," And I'm looking at J&K right now."
"5928990","5932330"," You guys got to whether you know this or not about J&K."
"5933230","5940490"," When we have moments of capitulation in the market, a risk off type of event. "
"5941270","5943090"," That's where J&K is right now."
"5943470","5949610"," It's in a risk off posture right now today at this moment."
"5950630","5955990"," When you see a sell-off in J&K, it can be a leading indicator, believe it or not. "
"5956530","5959330"," That actually will lead before the market will sell off."
"5959830","5963010"," You'll see a capitulation move briefly in J&K."
"5966150","5968630"," And it's it's showing itself right now. "
"5969270","5972290"," And it's on it's at a place at a dollar 239."
"5973350","5974850"," It's not where you want to see it."
"5975230","5976450"," I'm not going to lie to you. "
"5976510","5979250"," There's there's no way that you want to see J&K."
"5979610","5981970"," And the market is trading higher right now, believe it or not."
"5982530","5983790"," 425 is not. "
"5985030","5991430"," The market actually hasn't filmed the rollover yet, where J&K is showing the rollover currently in"
"5991430","5992350"," the market before it happens."
"5993850","5999470"," So I'm going to keep my eyes here on J&K for the rest of this morning and see if"
"5999470","6000910"," we can get a rollover here."
"6008030","6009030"," I've got an update here. "
"6009130","6010170"," I'm going to post for you."
"6012870","6016550"," But don't like seeing J&K trading this low."
"6019210","6021030"," It's no bueno. "
"6021430","6026710"," No matter what the rest of the market is telling you for where it's currently at at this moment."
"6027690","6028290"," It's not good."
"6028510","6038410"," Now watching some some high algo score calls coming into United Airlines, Rivian X United Airlines,"
"6038690","6040230"," March 25th, 38C. "

"6050340","6050880"," Airlines."
"6051120","6052080"," The market's pointing well."
"6052240","6059440"," It's a slightly NASA composite still down more than 1.8%. It's a p-down, one and a half percent. "
"6065350","6069510"," It says that the U.S. stock market is opening lower amid ongoing untrained uncertainty."
"6070010","6073810"," Commodity prices continue to surge after Russia stepped up a tax over the weekend."

"6121090","6124070"," Yeah, the rest of this is from Australia this morning."
"6125270","6129070"," This is just an update on currently on our market. "
"6142190","6145730"," I want to give you some sort of a market warning at this point."
"6145730","6151710"," We could trade higher from here, but I need to give you a market warning at this point on because"
"6151710","6152870"," of J&K specifically."
"6155720","6164000"," You were to see J&K trade below the 102.7, 0.07, excuse me. "
"6164880","6174600"," You could see a market sell off with a price target probably of 405 today."
"6175240","6179940"," That's not probable of a real possibility."
"6180960","6183260"," You could see a one or two hundred point drop on the spot. "
"6185820","6187360"," We'll see if there's anything down there."
"6202210","6204110"," Tonight as I said 405, how about 410?"
"6212090","6214650"," I'm not seeing a wonder if this is real money selling too."

"6246730","6255210"," you that watching currently where we are, sometimes we'll reverse on this where we are currently,"
"6255570","6263210"," but I do need to warn you that watching J&K trade at these levels currently junk bonds trading on"
"6263210","6267590"," these lows right now can trigger a market event. "
"6268130","6277310"," So to be aware of that wheat's now trading back, it's only at 4.7% at the moment."
"6281670","6282730"," We'll see if this holds."
"6282970","6285170"," It has more sellers on it than buyers currently. "
"6285410","6290730"," We'll take another look at it and see if the buyers step back in at one point, or if this"
"6290730","6292970"," is going to turn into a dilution type event."
"6295330","6298210"," That's my thought is that they're going to dilute the ETF."
"6299930","6302290"," They're going to try to sell more shares. "
"6354360","6355180"," Let's look up."
"6358040","6358820"," To you guys."
"6359220","6375040"," The gate threshold"
"6375040","6376480"," in my mic is a little too tight. "
"6378080","6378760"," Thanks, Steven."
"6381450","6384190"," I will take a look at my my gate threshold."
"6388390","6392350"," I was just messing around with it too this past week. "
"6392950","6400770"," I had to reset my my throat, my gate threshold and my compressor and expander."
"6401210","6402430"," Thanks for the heads up on that."
"6406510","6407730"," Take a look at Oracle. "
"6407730","6410310"," Oracle for you."
"6426720","6433480"," Yeah, I'm a little concerned here with the gun phones."
"6441720","6442820"," What a Oracle. "
"6447920","6450820"," Yeah, I tried to do new settings on my microphone."
"6451140","6456260"," I was trying to make a switch to LBS studio and I bought a new computer."
"6456700","6459120"," Well, I bought a not a pre-built. "
"6459880","6465000"," I had someone build me a computer from eBay."
"6466280","6473200"," Pick what you wanted in it and I got the computer here and not doing what I wanted to do."
"6473580","6477180"," So I had to go to my computer guy and dropped it off to him. "
"6477300","6482600"," But in the meantime, I had to work on when I was rebuilding OBS studio."
"6483420","6491520"," I had to work on my microphone settings."
"6492480","6494840"," So that alone takes like half an hour. "
"6496140","6500540"," Testing audio takes like, so I'm going to go back and work on it again."
"6503810","6504530"," So Oracle."
"6515360","6518180"," I'll try to keep the mic right in front of me as well so he has to hear my audio. "
"6530940","6532840"," I'll look at another chart for you on Oracle."
"6539800","6541240"," That's a long way to go, doesn't it?"
"6546640","6555740"," Figure Oracle can trade as low as what, 50, 57, somewhere in there."
"6560160","6563660"," We'll take a look at lower on Oracle and see how deeply it can trade. "
"6565140","6569100"," You can see here it's just a wall of sellers on Oracle."
"6576440","6580260"," There are more buyers than sellers right now currently in Oracle."
"6584280","6586140"," So we'll start looking lower. "
"6587040","6588160"," And this is the accumulation."
"6588740","6592200"," This is my one concern with Oracle, right?"
"6592360","6600420"," This is the same as Uber here is you might catch a bounce here and you might see call flow"
"6600420","6607260"," come in on Oracle, but it might just be used to get a better exit price as it steps lower."
"6616790","6624960"," We've got more buyers at 72.80. Probably have to convince the system to get"
"6624960","6631650"," a better look at it. "
"6639000","6664800"," How deep"
"6664800","6666440"," in Oracle trade is the question now?"
"6666580","6667600"," It must have advanced function."
"6688630","6690110"," Do you want to know how deep it can trade?"
"6696250","6714010"," 60, 320, 60, price"
"6714010","6715170"," target of 60 on Oracle."
"6717550","6718990"," Less market conditions change. "
"6721250","6731020"," Give another price target below it, 56.90. Have a"
"6731020","6733320"," lot of space for it to drop."
"6734500","6742340"," Looks like if it breaks $70 somewhere in there, if you break $70 on Oracle, you're going to see a"
"6742340","6750120"," Selva news type event down to $57.56, somewhere in there."
"6750840","6752880"," So you don't want to see it break $70. "
"6753760","6761760"," If you see a break of $70 on Oracle, break down here, you see this break down here."
"6762520","6770400"," You're probably going to see some pre-falling down to 60 possibly even deeper, $56 on Oracle."
"6786070","6788030"," Wheat is not a stock. "
"6789170","6795000"," Let me know if I have this right or if I have this wrong."
"6796900","6806860"," You guys know that a share is"
"6806860","6807560"," part of a stock."
"6810040","6813120"," So there's shares within a stock, right?"
"6813360","6814780"," So you can have an ETF with a stock. "
"6815060","6818520"," The stock is 100 shares, I think."
"6818520","6824300"," If you're wrong on this, you have to go back and check in the way back time machine."
"6825520","6829040"," If an ETF can have a stock, it would be 100 shares in a stock. "
"6829860","6830360"," It makes sense?"
"6832180","6835800"," I guess you could say it's an ETF, not a stock."
"6836780","6837840"," I guess that works too."
"6841440","6845100"," I thought 100 shares was a stock of shares. "
"6845100","6846160"," Be wrong on that."
"6846600","6849000"," Maybe we intermixed the mingle word."
"6850760","6853360"," Yeah, Amazon's got fucked this morning. "
"6854300","6856740"," Amazon got straight fucked this morning."
"6857900","6859660"," It's recovered somewhat at this point."
"6863380","6867000"," You know, Oracle could have market conditions make it raise itself up. "
"6868480","6870840"," Starting to see a reversal right now in the supply."
"6871540","6872900"," See if it can hold itself together."
"6875200","6876220"," It's like a skip box. "
"6876480","6878640"," 25 minutes or so to the European close."
"6879000","6881060"," The DAX is down close to one and a half percent."
"6881220","6884820"," The Kakarot down three quarters of her percent as we push towards the close. "
"6885440","6892440"," The Euro trading at 108.76. Yeah, you know, gas prices for Uber and Lyft, not good."
"6892660","6892980"," I don't know."
"6893240","6897160"," You know what that reminds me of is, I don't know if I mean, I guess that's an argument to"
"6897160","6897320"," short. "
"6898180","6904640"," Uber and Lyft, but the reality is that some companies can pass along cost to their, um, their."
"6906380","6909140"," Customers like Polktoa do that, right?"
"6909500","6913340"," And I think that Uber and Lyft to an extent do that as well."
"6915600","6919440"," Amuhang pasta and macaroni are just going to start off. "
"6919480","6919520"," Yeah."
"6922440","6924980"," That's a good point, Captain Ron."
"6926700","6928280"," Yeah, big text being sold. "
"6929620","6932760"," Well, I guess by ugly apples getting drilled."
"6935060","6938000"," I didn't even see the AMD buyback."
"6938160","6941400"," I'm having some problems with the fucking stat right now. "
"6941660","6942900"," I don't know why."
"6943540","6948980"," Let me buy a rolling here."
"6950020","6951140"," Well, I'm going to go back up. "
"6951380","6953100"," No, I don't know if spy is rolling."
"6953260","6957900"," I know that my concern with spy right now is, oh, let me go back up and see what you"
"6957900","6958420"," guys are saying."
"6965540","6966480"," I looked at Oracle. "
"6973280","6975040"," You put the press release up on wheat."
"6976580","6978040"," The spy rolling off."
"6978400","6981120"," I can't tell if spies rolling over here or not. "
"6981380","6983000"," I'm in some spy calls just so you know."
"6983840","6984940"," I started legging in."
"6985120","6986980"," I started legging into them earlier. "
"6987420","6992380"," And I think the last ones I bought were 67 cents."
"6993220","6996540"," I haven't, I haven't looked at my trading account, but I haven't looked yet."
"6998360","7000260"," But I don't like J&K where it's at. "
"7000480","7004300"," So J&K is showing one of two things, right?"
"7004400","7009940"," It's either showing a major market reversal way higher or it's showing a risk off event."
"7011240","7016860"," But it's not good where it sat down at 102.39. And so when you're down there at that number,"
"7018000","7019920"," you're going to have one or two move, right?"
"7020080","7020640"," It's not going to trade."
"7021360","7023240"," The market's not going to trade sideways down here. "
"7023340","7027420"," It's either going to risk off or it's going to risk on down here."
"7029890","7031430"," Hey, Cal, zone."
"7040510","7041910"," What is my peak outlook?"
"7042430","7043950"," What is my outlook for the US dollar?"
"7044110","7044490"," Has it peaked?"
"7044750","7045310"," No, it has not. "
"7050000","7051720"," No, good question."
"7052100","7055320"," Are my support and resistance levels that I post come from?"
"7055460","7056560"," Are those spot gamma numbers?"
"7057000","7057660"," No, they're not."
"7057980","7062580"," So those are, I forget where I get them from. "
"7064320","7065240"," I forget the anyway."
"7065240","7075240"," So I use those support resistance levels and then I layer on top of that spot gamma volatility and"
"7075240","7079740"," gamma level on top of traditional support resistance levels."
"7080260","7082940"," So we start from the beginning with the classical charting. "
"7083280","7088000"," You start starting with classical charting and then you also add in support resistance levels."
"7088460","7098520"," The only thing that I don't add to onto that with you guys are moving averages, anything, stuff"
"7098520","7098900"," like that."
"7099040","7100660"," I don't give you guys those levels. "
"7100940","7104800"," I just, because you guys can pop those on your own charts but just an indicator, you don't need me"
"7104800","7105880"," to do that stuff."
"7106500","7110380"," I'm going to give classic, those are just classic support resistance levels that change every day."
"7112800","7114520"," Does my sound still fucking off?"
"7115360","7116940"," Can you guys hear my fucking microphone?"
"7117780","7118980"," God, damn it. "
"7122920","7124100"," Yeah, wheat's been good."
"7131640","7133680"," Yeah, Morrie, that's what they were saying, right?"
"7134280","7135340"," So wheat is an ETN."
"7135900","7139320"," So you believe that it has to have actual wheat back and it's in order to issue more shares that"
"7139320","7140680"," would have to buy actual wheat. "
"7141880","7143900"," I think that's what they were saying in the news article."
"7145500","7146920"," It's something like that, Morrie."
"7147280","7149160"," Even if you are wrong, it's something like that. "
"7153420","7155600"," Yeah, W-E-A-T is the ticker."
"7157730","7158970"," I haven't sold fucking wheat."
"7159170","7159770"," I'm not selling it. "
"7162540","7168360"," But all the wheat shares, I don't know we started that trade like a week or two ago, two weeks"
"7168360","7168600"," ago."
"7169920","7171040"," A check to Oracle."
"7173570","7177030"," You don't have to wait for the SAC to allow more share of the space. "
"7179490","7181190"," Pulling's asking for energy strength."
"7184980","7190140"," So the thought process was Drink tells asking buy gold with what?"
"7190840","7201260"," The notion is that Putin was buying both"
"7201260","7202060"," gold."
"7202580","7206660"," It was rolling money from Bitcoin into gold when it was low. "
"7208400","7210800"," And that was the play."
"7211280","7216720"," There was the energy trade for Russia and then the energy trade rolled into the gold trade."
"7217580","7220840"," I have to do a whole show on that. "
"7222970","7225570"," Because I got to show you guys bona fides and all that stuff."
"7225830","7231430"," But there's this whole argument behind the scenes I want to lay out for you."
"7231790","7234790"," Why war happened now with Ukraine?"
"7235250","7243470"," Why it didn't happen previously to show how the trades line up for a country and other traders and"
"7243470","7246550"," investors around the world to make that trade. "
"7247070","7250310"," To make the gold trade, to make commodities trade."
"7251070","7258990"," As a matter of fact, you're seeing China today talk about how they had a bad season right and that"
"7258990","7260990"," they're not planting as much right now."
"7263810","7266150"," This doesn't really hurt me or anything. "
"7266670","7267390"," So I have family."
"7267990","7272670"," I have family that have a very large rent."
"7273410","7279830"," It's I don't know where you live but wherever you live out there it's probably larger than whatever"
"7279830","7283950"," town or city or even county that you live in. "
"7284410","7286030"," Probably larger than that area."
"7286230","7289570"," That's how big our family ran through."
"7290810","7291850"," But you will. "
"7292130","7301330"," So I have some at least some knowledge in the background of commodities right and how commodities"
"7301330","7302230"," are traded."
"7302770","7303770"," To some extent."
"7304070","7308770"," So it's not like I'm coming at you from some weird left field or anything off of rise and fall"
"7308770","7309290"," commodities. "
"7309750","7317770"," You won't talk about this in the news oftentimes because if you knew the truth you'd be like this"
"7317770","7318670"," is bullshit right."
"7321190","7323390"," It shouldn't be like this but whatever."
"7323890","7329270"," As if you're still on this so we can kind of track how this all was laid out, how it"
"7329270","7335710"," all began, how we got to where we are right now in the commodities market and metals as well. "
"7336290","7341650"," And there's some contention out there that physical gold was bought and massed by Russia."
"7342670","7344710"," Leading up to the Forest War right."
"7344910","7354310"," The start of war and you have all these other or wheels and play that you know prints money for"
"7354310","7355510"," specific people. "
"7356230","7358250"," And there's a bunch of different sides to this."
"7358830","7363990"," Matter of fact I was just talking to a friend about it was interesting you heard Biden the other"
"7363990","7370610"," day tell oil and gas producers don't in his speech he said don't take advantage of it."
"7371290","7374790"," And I think we're a live streaming this was a lot we could but a week and a half ago"
"7374790","7376250"," two weeks ago we were listening to Biden speak. "
"7377050","7378730"," He said don't take advantage of it."
"7379250","7381290"," And of course they're going to take advantage of this."
"7381710","7383810"," There's no there's no US pumper. "
"7384290","7390030"," If I'm pumping which they do that too they pump oil or they pump gas off the family rent."
"7390030","7396230"," But you know if you're a gas producer an oil producer in the US the price of oil and gas"
"7396230","7402590"," comes up and you try to tell me that I have to pump more gas or oil why the fuck"
"7402590","7404570"," would I want to pump more oil and gas."
"7405070","7413510"," I have zero interest to develop new wells open new wells reopen old wells. "
"7414570","7418030"," I've got no no no benefit for me to do that none."
"7419130","7425290"," Now it will eventually happen but you're telling me when the price goes up that I'm supposed to"
"7425290","7429970"," dilute the price of gas and all you're fucking crazy if you think that I'm going to do that."
"7431050","7434070"," Absolutely batch it crazy if you think that's going to happen. "
"7434250","7436990"," That's part of what Biden was saying was don't take advantage of it."
"7436990","7437690"," Of course they are."
"7438450","7444110"," Then you've got some artificial inflation of prices as well that are intentional the same thing"
"7444110","7450890"," with China today saying oh we're going to be short wheat right. "
"7451110","7455650"," So you're kind of like eh are you just saying you're short wheat right now and then you'll have a"
"7455650","7458790"," bumper crop and the price will come down later on but it's more important now to kick the game"
"7458790","7460410"," those profits on future."
"7461830","7462730"," Talk about this later."
"7462930","7467610"," This is not the time in place because I have to show you this information so I can back all"
"7467610","7468630"," of this all of this stuff. "
"7470590","7475250"," Okay just look beyond wheat ripple effects corn so it's petrol drag back up to us exactly."
"7475890","7478130"," Rush has all the gold willy dike here for money and stocks."
"7478590","7480290"," There may be some so many guys already know this. "
"7480450","7481830"," I can see some of you guys already know this."
"7482450","7486430"," Maybe a mechanics of wheat the fund and the underlying futures limit up and the fund may be under"
"7486430","7487070"," capitalized."
"7487230","7488330"," Probably is limit up days you know. "
"7488710","7491230"," Yeah let's do in this more good good point willy smoke me."
"7491470","7495790"," I was thinking about the more I was thinking about the call."
"7496090","7500570"," I kept seeing call flow on wheat a couple of weeks ago like heavy heavy call flow. "
"7502490","7503530"," Nope never traded boo."
"7504750","7506310"," Fixed the negative all morning."
"7506570","7507790"," We assumed we'd. "
"7507790","7512070"," Oh my god I missed a bunch of you guys but are a bunch of what you guys are asking."
"7513650","7516550"," Yeah actually I was not looking better it wasn't."
"7519790","7520730"," He's in his book. "
"7523110","7524590"," I checked the oracle."
"7525730","7526670"," Facebook's plummeting."
"7531280","7532860"," Yeah I saw the credit spreads. "
"7533180","7534160"," No boys making a good point."
"7534480","7537720"," I actually looked at the credit spreads on trading gee this morning."
"7538120","7539380"," Before the market opened. "
"7539380","7541200"," They got blown the fuck out bro."
"7542520","7544560"," I haven't looked at Facebook yet this morning."
"7549730","7552650"," Four or ten P's or only five cents imagine. "
"7553350","7557290"," Yeah if you saw J&K roll the fuck over today would be baller wouldn't it."
"7559230","7560970"," Snap puts a friend right on."
"7561710","7562710"," Five's going down. "
"7566680","7572180"," So figuring out money is saying if J&K J&K cracks February 24th low before market does that could"
"7572180","7572720"," be a leading it."
"7572720","7578400"," Yeah so J&K you got you know what else talks about J&K a lot is Derek Kotonoy."
"7579280","7580240"," Follows J&K. "
"7580360","7584780"," I think he's the one that really turned me on to it to J&K a couple of years ago"
"7584780","7588740"," and the thing about J&K is that it's actually leads."
"7589200","7592480"," It's it leads before the market actually makes the move."
"7592960","7600300"," It's sometimes the lead can be like 15 minutes three hours a day but you can see the lead in"
"7600300","7602540"," J&K before the market actually goes there. "
"7603060","7605160"," It's turning around currently right now."
"7606620","7610760"," So it is it is making it is is turning around currently."
"7611420","7615440"," The spy is trying to turn itself around right there as well. "
"7616040","7625560"," I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if that's a good sign either."
"7625560","7628620"," That's going to actually that spy is actually going to tell me."
"7628680","7636440"," I think people are starting to reserve themselves knowing that the market has problems which does"
"7636440","7638700"," it's got some major major major major. "
"7639680","7643760"," Some calls coming in on spy currently SPX calls coming in again."
"7645520","7648660"," That's always that that that that uh pull and tug right."
"7649360","7652120"," You're still seeing a bit in the market even though the market's trading lower. "
"7655320","7656980"," Pull it up the spy again real quick."
"7657820","7659180"," Let's see what's happening with the spy."
"7665260","7666960"," No I do not live in Indiana. "
"7669040","7673000"," You want to know where my family ranches I'll tell you it's in Montana."
"7674340","7680380"," I'm not from Michigan or this is where I'm currently living right now."
"7680800","7683340"," I buy I buy homes here in Michigan. "
"7683860","7686800"," I used to renovate them and sell them."
"7687400","7695060"," Now I buy them and hold them so that I can retire in safety."
"7696480","7701500"," But I'm heading back to West and my family is in Montana. "
"7702200","7704980"," Giant ranch it's giant."
"7711580","7713020"," Did you see that?"
"7713160","7720900"," Hey Laura I picked to make it a little throaty like the whispering to Alexa and you see I'm still"
"7720900","7721600"," in uber calls."
"7722340","7724340"," I'm gonna have to try to get out of it at some point. "

"8876280","8884180"," you can look at major support at 800 then 750 and assuming it's 700 the question becomes it lower"
"8884180","8892380"," than 700 absolutely absolutely can trade below 700 yes we can and because of the market we can"
"8892380","8901080"," trade below 700 now we know that we have currently we've got some support at 700 nobody had buyers"
"8901080","8908320"," step in at 650 right it doesn't that low didn't well we had down to 700 I think free market"
"8908320","8917880"," 691 we got down to 691 62 the question becomes going to trade lower than that of course of course"
"8917880","8923300"," just market capitulation we can you can actually see the buyers sitting down here at 650 currently"
"8923300","8928760"," they're sitting down here there's some some you know a bank or something sitting down saying yeah"
"8928760","8935160"," we can get down to 650 we're gonna put a buy-in down below here the other question becomes if"
"8935160","8940140"," you look at the Tesla chart and you're like man this you know Tesla's been consolidating since 12"
"8940140","8949620"," 11 45 right well we rejected up from this zone here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8"
"8949620","8959540"," 9 10 and today would be the 11th time to be rejected off of this major correction channel"
"8959540","8966060"," so what does that tell us about Tesla it tells us that typically when you're in a corrective"
"8966060","8974740"," typically when you're in a corrective movement in a ticker right let's use Tesla as an example it's"
"8974740","8980740"," in a corrective dance yeah you can trade it as it trades down you can buy bottoms and sell tops"
"8980740","8989020"," but typically you'll be looking for a capitulation move and then you're going to look for some kind"
"8989020","8996180"," of sideways consolidation so we had we had what some testables would say hey this is a we had a"
"8996180","9001920"," capitulation move back at 691 take cap we capitulated at 691 we should be trading higher at this"
"9001920","9008020"," point okay so then my point to you from that point is that you're going to then consolidate so that"
"9008020","9015300"," would make your new trading zone let's call it 700 right you can call it 700 we can call it"
"9015300","9024660"," even 750 if you want it we call the upper bound of your consolidation zone it's called 900 right so"
"9024660","9032000"," you're going to see up and down trade in here until it gains enough support to trade higher or"
"9032000","9037240"," market conditions change so the question then becomes okay do we have anything out there that's"
"9037240","9042540"," going to limit Tesla trading higher even with all the good news on on Elon being a great guy even"
"9042540","9048240"," with all that hey we hope we're opening giga in Germany we're opening giga on Mars right now we got"
"9049060","9056840"," Elon giving star-like satellites kissing babies in Ukraine reality is that you need consolidation"
"9056840","9063780"," here right and the reality is that you need market conditions to turn favorable for Tesla as well"
"9063780","9071620"," because they're they're waiting inside of the market so my point to you would be that we don't have"
"9071620","9080280"," that yet we don't have a truce in in Ukraine of any kind you don't have the FOMC which everyone's"
"9080280","9088520"," waiting for to be passed us in the 15th of March and we're trading in a consolidation pattern here"
"9088520","9093620"," so my only point to you would be that you should have bought the dip down here at 691 you're"
"9093620","9099780"," still up at this point if you're looking for the next dip to buy on Tesla my recommendation would"
"9099780","9107440"," be to look for another move lower between now and the 15th you're going to be looking for another"
"9107440","9115280"," move that lower down to let's call it 727 to 700 at a minimum"
"9115280","9120660"," that's what you're going to be looking for more than likely you're going to be looking for that if"
"9120660","9128220"," you want to be aggressive as a bull here maybe looking to buy like 770 maybe 750 you could start"
"9128220","9134220"," to enter a trade again a second trade into Tesla if you stay gonna stay to me well no Tesla's"
"9134220","9139960"," gonna trade higher cap going to 900 it's been it's in this huge bull flag right now cap you know"
"9139960","9144780"," whenever you see it whenever I see a bull cap or a bull flag just typically a capitulation moment"
"9144780","9151500"," even inside of that that bull flag not always but good enough right that I'll usually just wait for"
"9151500","9156980"," it if I miss that fail I'll move on to a different kicker so we could trade up here but"
"9156980","9160860"," the market conditions aren't saying that we're going to there's nothing coming out of Ukraine"
"9160860","9166400"," there's nothing that's going to change the FOMC as Italian Treasury going to be selling six billion"
"9166400","9172900"," euros in 12-month DOT bill so what's the point that agency that's sort of there announcing an"
"9172900","9180780"," upcoming bill sale what do you do as a bull on on Tesla well I would say to you you"
"9180780","9186380"," want another entry point I'll give them to you right now you ready your next entry on Tesla's 772"
"9186380","9196380"," 74 755 72 average down and into let's call it 700 and it wouldn't shock"
"9196380","9203100"," me to even see a capitulation move lower to 650 so if you had one hundred dollars I'm not just"
"9203100","9209020"," using this as a baseline like in fairytale not fairytale land but in like theoretical land or"
"9209020","9214360"," something right get a hundred dollars spend on Tesla right now I would say sure five five dollars"
"9214360","9222000"," here and then I would say buy another ten dollars down at 776 75 I would say buy another five"
"9222000","9228920"," dollars down at 748 50 I would say buy another ten dollars down at 715 oh wait and then I"
"9228920","9234460"," would say look for 650 and then throw 60 bucks at it or something like that 50 bucks at it"
"9234460","9239300"," that's what I would say to you right now and if you said well hey cap what if we don't"
"9239300","9245600"," go down there and I didn't get to buy down here at at 690 and I would say to you"
"9245600","9250340"," we were that would mean that we've paid it higher you've broken out of our negative channel that"
"9250340","9256220"," means the entire market's heading up means that the correction is over for Tesla it means that we"
"9256220","9265440"," were already at 1211 and let's say we traded 950 970 1000 do you need all of it no"
"9265440","9273800"," could you enter higher yes you don't have to breathe into that new low us equity futures are"
"9273800","9279540"," bouncing a bit down one and a half percent the S&P minis off that 42 38 low scene about"
"9279540","9285700"," 15 minutes ago so you don't need like to own Tesla at the absolute bottom if you want to own"
"9285700","9293750"," Tesla that's the absolute bottom then that is the I gave you the numbers I gave you the numbers"
"9293750","9304230"," where that is uh yeah you're inter-day day trading report resistance 825 98 820 60 real"
"9304230","9310590"," inter-day support is 8108 in reality there's probably going to be a trade back down at some point"
"9310590","9320410"," to 750 if not even lower to 650 believe it or not resistance above is 858 71 on an inter "
"9320410","9329130","-day 864 38 and then again higher at 868 70 we'll look higher now and we already know that the"
"9329130","9334550"," real sellers are still hiding not above right you know that they're up there we take a look at it"
"9334550","9343030"," and they're still sitting here at 890 and 900 above a wall of sellers trying to get out on Tesla"
"9343030","9348370"," just hoping and praying that it gets up to 900 they can take profit more than likely these are"
"9348370","9353230"," buyers down at 7 or at 690 they just want to trade it up to 900 take their money and"
"9353230","9359130"," run and look for their next entry right they can re-up on more Tesla calls or if you're a"
"9359130","9363670"," Tesla bull you're like hey keep coming down right I know that they're i'm friends with some real"
"9363670","9370470"," Tesla bulls on twitter and they want it even cheaper than 6 691 believe it or not they want it"
"9370470","9377670"," much lower 650 or so even probably 600 there are Tesla bulls that want it lower than even that so"
"9377670","9383010"," they can get a better buy-in so I think they were going there the market's saying we are"
"9383010","9389330"," commodities are saying that we are it might not be today but you know everything's walking and"
"9389330","9395310"," smelling like a duck right now the fed is the fed has been backed into a corner they don't have"
"9395310","9405310"," a choice when you like 25 VPS talk right there's a the 20 like everyone's like well"
"9405310","9411910"," we're good right i'm the same way we're good so when the when when when when Biden first said or"
"9411910","9417710"," that by when Powell first said well we're we're gonna do 25 basis point we're gonna start to cut"
"9417710","9422630"," off PQ or you speak or cut off QE at some point and we say all that stuff it all"
"9422630","9429190"," makes sense to an extent but then when you start to look around everywhere else you start to see"
"9429190","9438590"," that there are other outside of the stock market conditions that are forcing more"
"9438590","9444670"," aggressiveness out of the fed do I think that actually works no but that will it will get a"
"9444670","9450910"," reaction from the fed you will see the fed be required to act on these outside forces I kid you"
"9450910","9455170"," not you think it means nothing when you see gas prices go up I know you guys think it means"
"9455170","9462750"," nothing I posted last day the old school video of 1973 of when gas prices go went higher you might"
"9462750","9469630"," say well this time it's different but I promise you fucking promise you okay at the end of that"
"9469630","9474410"," video there's a guy there and he was like well he was like I'm an American he's like everything"
"9474410","9481150"," that I do requires energy because he goes I live to consume he's like I like to go skiing I"
"9481150","9485710"," like to go to this and I could chat and like have the clothes like have food I like to"
"9485710","9493050"," have a burgers and all this other shit right I'm telling you the the crunch that comes will start"
"9493050","9500790"," to slow our economy down when you have commodities they're they're high price okay you start to add"
"9500790","9505530"," up I hey I paid X amount of dollars in my house hey I'm paying more gas hey I'm paying"
"9505530","9511590"," more for a burger hey my groceries are more expensive you start to tack them on you start to see"
"9511590","9517430"," what price of everything becomes it doesn't matter at that point what your what your salary"
"9517430","9521850"," increases have been and then you get another whammy in the background that we've talked about in"
"9521850","9527470"," the show in the past as well and that's the one where and as a matter of fact I forget"
"9527470","9532650"," who it was it didn't it goes Netflix it's been a few I don't know how many of you got"
"9532650","9537250"," maybe I know some of you do or you pay attention your favorite kicker when you listen to guidances"
"9537250","9542270"," we've talked about paying attention to the guidance that's been given by some of these companies"
"9542270","9550430"," this year and the point that I was trying to make was that the point that I was trying to"
"9550430","9557190"," make to all of you out there at the beginning of earning season was pay attention to what is said"
"9557190","9563210"," within some of these guidances and some of these companies were honest some of these companies said"
"9563210","9569690"," they were honest they said not I think it was Netflix but I'm not positive it was some it was"
"9569690","9578450"," Netflix somebody else and they said specifically our first step right our first step is to pass the"
"9578450","9585330"," price of goods or services along for customers this is a tale as old as time so when there's"
"9585330","9589610"," inflation right when there's shortages when there's labor when there's all like we have too many"
"9589610","9596490"," people at work right like command higher prices that companies that can will pass along the cost of"
"9596490","9605810"," these services and goods to their customers okay that's step one right there and that is was has"
"9605810","9611530"," been what's been happening in our market right now that they've just been reported by companies and"
"9611530","9614890"," their earnings reports that they have to they're getting their guidance that they're required by a"
"9614890","9624880"," lot to be honest about and then step two step two believe it or not right"
"9624880","9633200"," is you're going to hear about layoffs you're going to at some point well not layoffs first you'll"
"9633200","9642080"," hear you'll it could be a combination of layoffs right and a a reduction of the services or"
"9642080","9648840"," products that they produce you'll hear companies say well we're going to focus on this right now"
"9648840","9655060"," instead of expanding right that's I'm sorry I'm misspeaking here so before you see the layoffs in"
"9655060","9660300"," the we're focusing this product you're going to see them say well we were spending money over here"
"9660300","9666320"," can we cut back those costs we're going to cut back on just instead of a new i i i"
"9666320","9670960"," car we're not going to work in the i car right now right so you're not going to get expansion"
"9670960","9675660"," anymore then the next step is we started to lay people off we're starting to focus on our core"
"9675660","9681760"," product we're going to focus on on on that aspect of business that's part of that tightening okay"
"9681760","9687360"," and so when you start to see that tightening it does actually impact this guy named bob out there"
"9687360","9692880"," who's saying oh yeah i work at apple i'm an engineer at apple everything is hunky dory and i got"
"9692880","9698640"," a great rate of my house and you know i paid out the ass for it i'm paying out the"
"9698640","9703600"," ass for gas paying out the ass for my mcdonald's burger and i'm not mcdonald's but you know i'm"
"9703600","9707820"," paying out the ass for my ski trip with the family just paying out the ass for all these different"
"9707820","9713800"," things and then if the if the rug gets pulled on enough engineers right and then enough of these"
"9713800","9720140"," engineers can't pay for their houses and that neighborhood that you're living in and they start to"
"9720140","9726420"," lose their homes or start to sell their homes or foreclose their homes this stuff starts to add up"
"9726420","9732160"," so right now currently in our market when you're looking at uh the price of gas go up when you"
"9732160","9735900"," look at the price of weak go up when you look at the price of everything going up out there"
"9735900","9741140"," right even if you've got this kick ass job even if you're if you're out there right and the reason"
"9741140","9748100"," for this is this okay is because i'm an investor and i'm a trader so these companies to give a"
"9748100","9756300"," fly and fuck about you and your engineering job they are beholden to investors and traders out"
"9756300","9762280"," there and they will do everything that they can to to to make profit as a matter of fact a"
"9762280","9769360"," great documentary came out a week or two ago about Boeing on netflix and if any of you haven't seen"
"9769360","9775800"," it yet you watch it because they talk about Boeing uh they were once a public company but they were"
"9775800","9781420"," run really well they then they merged right you know at a time when mergers and acquisitions became"
"9781420","9787420"," huge with McDonald Douglas and they switched from a company that was focused on making the best"
"9787420","9791920"," thing in the world the best jets in the world best planes in the world best spacecraft in the world"
"9791920","9797310"," and they switched to being beholden to their investors and they outline what happens to these"
"9797310","9802810"," companies when they are driven like that so when you're driven like that as a company you're"
"9802810","9808250"," beholden to your your your your your stockholders your investors you tell any these companies are"
"9808250","9813970"," fucking ruthless and if you think you're an engineer out there you think that because you got it"
"9813970","9818350"," yourself a master of engineering and mechanical engineering and you work for these companies that"
"9818350","9824650"," you'll always have a job that is not fucking true it is not because you've seen these cycles even"
"9824650","9830370"," if it's a short-term debt cycle not a long-term debt but just the short-term debt cycle tightening"
"9830370","9835750"," cycle where you see uh not you know you've already seen it in speculative growth companies getting"
"9835750","9840170"," whacked because we're not giving free money away supposedly at some point we're not going to give"
"9840170","9845310"," free money away when you start to see a duck walk act and talk like a duck we're seeing it"
"9845310","9850450"," right now seeing that the Fed is going to get pushed into a corner being commodity price is going"
"9850450","9858610"," up got a meeting coming up about raising a rate and you start to you see high housing prices out"
"9858610","9866430"," there but you know all this stuff is becoming real and yay though apple might come back for the"
"9866430","9875210"," next three or four or two or three or ER quarters and say yeah hey we're making more money the"
"9875210","9884950"," signs are out there and even the guidances are out there saying hey hey we've"
"9884950","9891050"," passed along what we can to our customers and we're going to the next step for us is this or"
"9891050","9896530"," that right you'll see some be vague about they'll say well we see us we'll be we're hoping right"
"9896530","9903210"," now that we can hold out until this the short-term debt cycle the shortages go away that tightening"
"9903210","9909010"," uh goes away right so the point that they're trying to tell you is hey i'm a company we're going"
"9909010","9917190"," to cut everywhere and hope that we skip this this this short-term debt tightening phase"
"9917190","9922910"," incrementally how to wash in dca bipartisan leaders in the house and senate trade committees are"
"9922910","9926930"," going to announce an agreement on legislation hall regular trade relations with both russian"
"9926930","9932330"," bellaroose right so they're said there's what they're actually saying to you out there is we're"
"9932330","9937650"," going to do what we need to do and hope that the market picks back up down the road now"
"9937650","9943230"," in that time period and that's next for two three four quarters right if the economy doesn't"
"9943230","9948890"," fucking jump or doesn't kickstart again i'm going to tell you right because in those two three four"
"9948890","9953330"," quarters they are going to lay you off and they're going to hope that the that the tightening is"
"9953330","9957530"," over at that point right we have a quick tightening or not they're going to hope that there's more"
"9957530","9962630"," jobs trade because even if you got laid off from your apple engineering job hopefully there's"
"9962630","9967590"," there's money for a startup so you can go work for them believe it or not not apple again or"
"9967590","9972510"," i'm using them as an example as a vehicle in this and so that's the hope and that these companies"
"9972510","9977270"," are going to tell you this in their guidance right we're hoping for this to be short-term if it"
"9977270","9983670"," ends up not being short-term right it puts us into a longer term decline in our economy those from"
"9983670","9988850"," a short-term debt cycle that ought to tail and rest to a long-term debt cycle how do i"
"9988850","9993250"," think we're in the tail end of a long-term debt cycle no there are bears that disagree with me"
"9993250","9998810"," and say yes we are i heard fucking uh what's this uh deli tried to say we're at the at"
"9998810","10003190"," the or the beginning of uh of the end of it or the beginning of a of a long the"

"10006390","10011050"," years ago he's telling us that for 20 years so no i don't think we are i don't personally but"
"10011050","10019430"," we have these short-term cycles that can fuck our economy up and so right now i'm sorry everything"
"10019430","10024970"," point towards this happening just seeing a report of the earthquake early warning issued for japan"
"10024970","10034250"," off the coast of nodo rutrow so i think someone on reddit they said that a big a big like"

"10040330","10045110"," at the end of the day so my only point though behind this is that you as an investor you"
"10045110","10050970"," as a as a trader you as uh hey i love tesla i love this company i love it i"
"10050970","10055810"," get it but you've got to look just in the basic basic you don't have to understand all the"
"10055810","10059950"," internals you have to understand everything you know like all you have to know everything about"
"10059950","10064310"," bonds you have to know everything about commodities you don't have to trade all that shit you don't"
"10064310","10069370"," know all the particulars about it but you have to look at like guidance report from the basic"
"10069370","10074330"," things they tell you you have to look at is there going to be quantitative tightening you have to"
"10074330","10079750"," look you see are we gonna have rates raised you have to look around and see if fucking gas is"

"14112300","14125880"," of spx calls came through today and then"
"14125880","14135620"," i'll say the spy calls substantial amount of call buying on spy today"
"14135620","14146570"," and this"
"14146570","14152710"," shows the expectation this does show the expectation that spy should have been going up today or"
"14161070","14178500"," that the implication was that spy would be trading higher today those uh"
"14178500","14188300"," spy puts right those spy puts on 420 p's those only also 130 000 contract on"
"14188300","14196080"," those spy puts down to 420 there was 124 i think just about 15 minutes ago someone's adding more"
"14196080","14203940"," and more i don't know if it's to pin into the clothes today or not they're not out of 48"
"14203940","14213790"," cents 49 cents oh max pain oh so i'll tell you guys what max"

"14228440","14240970"," so max pain for today is 435 that's it's"
"14240970","14248930"," so heavily weighted towards uh puts today i'm looking down on the open interest in positions yeah"
"14253770","14263490"," it's lower we're right on if you look if you actually look on 420 is the target like if you"
"14263490","14269330"," look at the it's look at uh swaggy stocks i'll post the link to it right now on act captain's"
"14269330","14273750"," alpha the actual the one you want to be looking at because they've they're not basically you're all"

"14280210","14284590"," this is a good thing to comment now from the russian side of talks with ukraine negotiator medinsky"
"14284590","14289550"," says that it is too early to speak of anything positive after the third round of talks with ukraine"
"14289550","14294370"," so this is a neat thing to look at okay so back in the day swaggy stocks came on came"
"14294370","14302890"," online i don't know i don't know how many years ago was you're getting fucking old now so i just"
"14302890","14310390"," posted a link to swaggy stocks uh dashboard they're free version and there is some insight to be"
"14310390","14317470"," had from from this webpage it's it's automatically set to spy you can change the picker the how"
"14317470","14321790"," they don't track all of them but this is a neat one to look at right now currently so especially"
"14321790","14328670"," right now um a good point on max paying calculating so if you look at the swaggy stocks max paying"
"14328670","14333910"," calculator for spy today the russian negotiator does say however that talks with ukraine will"
"14333910","14343910"," continue that it does show that the max paying for today is 435 max paying today 435 on the spy"
"14343910","14349450"," now that doesn't really lend you any help right now currently but it is interesting to note that if"
"14349450","14355670"," you look below it it shows where the open interest is on picker and if you look where we're"
"14355670","14365670"," currently trading down here at 420 at 422 there is huge interest on 420Ps there's"
"14365670","14373090"," 28.37 000 contracts it looks like it's right in the middle it's not going to print it looks like"
"14373090","14379390"," it looks like market makers don't want to print uh 410 and it looks like they've already printed"
"14379390","14387510"," 431 and it looks like it's still weighted into the put side that it could easily swing down to"
"14387510","14397510"," which is where we're at 420 currently where we're at right now so neat place to look i"
"14397510","14406790"," posted the link on at captain's alpha just now if you're not uh if you haven't friended me on on"

"14445180","14453340"," we should lie if you look close more closely at it you can look to see especially right now is"
"14453340","14457440"," a good thing to look at is if you look at where the where the not just where max pain"
"14457440","14465380"," is but where has all max pain shows you is the midway point where more people get destroyed so the"
"14465380","14472920"," the concept used to be that the most people will lose it for 35, call holders will lose and put"
"14472920","14480880"," holders will lose but in reality if you look at the open interest chart just below it uh it shows"
"14480880","14489480"," you a better viewpoint of uh where where balance is right all things being equal you hear being"
"14489480","14496880"," said balance in the market it's actually lower it's at 420 it might even be slightly lower it could"

"18687690","18692690"," right started to consolidate and then failed again this that's what that F means failed again below"
"18692690","18696750"," it failed again below it then it started to consolidate again and it failed once more that's the"
"18696750","18703470"," second F and you see more it fell again down to what we think is new support right the right"
"18703470","18708890"," down at 10 bucks nine bucks and it started to consolidate again right so it's consolidating and"
"18708890","18715110"," it's starting to come up here right and just like above in those Fs that i wrote if you see"
"18715110","18721530"," what you really want to be looking for is more consolidation after breaking that panel and then you"
"18721530","18727470"," want to buy it after it breaks above the previous high that failed do you see that previous high"
"18727470","18734010"," that failed you want to buy it after here okay and the question becomes well hey cap well i want"
"18734010","18738690"," to buy that the bottom bottom i want to buy that 940 and trade it up from here we can't"
"18738690","18743390"," go no lower than here cap there's no way and there actually is a way for trade lower believe it"
"18743390","18748670"," or not from here now i know we're really low on palantare it could trade sideways like this you"
"18748670","18754190"," ready month two three months what if you get stuck in palantare and it trades between ten dollars"
"18754190","18760750"," and fourteen dollars for three months uh maybe your viewpoint is i'm going to wait for uh i'm going"
"18760750","18764470"," to i'm in it for the long haul well if you're in it for the long haul then i bet"
"18764470","18769090"," in that three months that it fades in this panel sideways that it dips down below ten bucks more"
"18769090","18773970"," than one so i would say don't accumulate so it drops below there in that consolidation phase"
"18773970","18779450"," otherwise your money would be best served elsewhere so i would say to you you have to wait until it"
"18779450","18785550"," breaks that previous that previous uh high that that previous breakout attempt that failed which is"
"18785550","18790170"," around fourteen dollars and twenty cents before you actually take along here if you're going to"
"18790170","18794530"," want to take along here right let's say you break out of this channel right then you want to be"
"18794530","18801930"," looking to then buy dips that break below the consolidation channel outside of the the negative"
"18801930","18806410"," downward channel so first you're going to break the negative downward channel then you have to buy"
"18806410","18814130"," lows in a consolidation sideways channel in palantare to the north or pick it up after it breaks"
"18814130","18823910"," above the uh the last failure point okay so i like palantare i just bother i'm going to wait for"
"18823910","18827830"," this to consolidate i'm going to try to grab it after it breaks out of its negative downward"
"18827830","18833370"," channel and in in one more moment maybe of a downward move down the nine ten bucks or i'm going"
"18833370","18838490"," to buy it above fourteen twenty two but right where it stands right here it's a fucking shop fest"
"18838490","18845910"," this is meant to destroy uh uh uh buyers and sellers believe it or not it's meant to destroy people"
