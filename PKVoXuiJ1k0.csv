"81570","82350"," Check 1-2."
"86690","87970"," All right, I'll get right into it."
"91360","92580"," Check 1-2, good morning. "
"93460","98560"," I've got a couple things I've got to do here real quick, and we'll get right into it."
"103620","110240"," I've got something for, hopefully, if Winky shows up this morning, we'll have something for him."
"123390","127030"," Not much has changed this morning. "
"127970","134520"," It's a title of this morning's stream."
"135980","138740"," I'm assuming that everyone woke up this morning pumped."
"139640","142720"," The close yesterday looked really good. "
"144520","147300"," Well, I've got that up there."
"149820","153740"," Yesterday's close was extremely bullish."
"154080","156040"," So yesterday I had, first good morning. "
"156860","157820"," See who's here?"
"160360","162820"," Yeah, it was off yesterday."
"163580","168680"," I took that early morning off to go back to the orthodontist, but then I came home and the power,"
"168820","170440"," not the power, the internet was out."
"170760","174460"," I was really weird too because I'm like, they're not going to believe this. "
"174840","176560"," I'm like, there's no way they're going to believe this."
"178060","180480"," And so I got home and the internet was out."
"180640","189140"," There was a car accident over on telegraph, and Detroit was on telegraph and Grand River or"
"189140","192340"," something, and knocked out the internet. "
"193540","198380"," And then, of course, they were like 1230 to be back on, and then it didn't come back on until"
"198380","205380"," late that night, but I didn't want to trade yesterday without the internet."
"205380","206480"," I didn't want to turn on my phone."
"209120","214600"," Let me see. "
"214740","215260"," So good morning."
"215400","221880"," In the meeting at China reported his current situation of its late in COVID prevention and control."
"222320","224000"," I've got nonsense fed speakers. "
"224320","226300"," Just diarrhea shit thrown on the walls this morning."
"227060","228100"," Morning, wakey."
"228820","230080"," Yeah, I got braces. "
"231580","236060"," No, I get bread and water, not the braces."
"238240","239320"," Good morning, Herushi."
"239480","239760"," How are you?"
"239940","240440"," Good morning. "
"243440","244700"," Market makes big moves."
"246460","250020"," Good morning, baking, morning, dean, morning, Otis, morning, Tony."
"250940","255920"," To me, a whole lot hasn't changed here in the market, which is kind of crazy because the morning is"
"255920","256160"," sweet out. "
"256680","257660"," That daughter's great."
"257880","258399"," Everybody's fine."
"258740","260899"," It's more just discomfort, that kind of stuff. "
"263270","263990"," And then availability."
"265430","271690"," So you'll get some unplanned morning event to get an unplanned morning event to get stuff done."
"273810","276350"," So not a lot changed yesterday either, though, right?"
"276790","278830"," We're going to show you a couple things this morning. "
"279550","281450"," I want to kind of show you where the market is still."
"286130","288090"," I think we talked about this on."
"290650","294050"," I think we talked about this on when was it?"
"296730","299010"," On the third two days ago, we talked about this. "
"299170","300590"," So we're going to talk about it again this morning."
"301970","304830"," And just to try to get everybody on the same page."
"305410","309330"," I saw some people on Finn Twitter, Twitter this morning. "
"309930","314090"," People seem to be in a day is not quite understanding where we are."
"318830","320830"," And why we are where we are."
"322590","324430"," So we will take a look at that. "
"326910","327790"," Turn off some."
"328030","330670"," I'm going to show you some PPO stuff and some."
"333670","335190"," PMO stuff at some point. "
"337890","341570"," I'm not quite sure why my charts aren't showing this."
"343350","344450"," In the background here."
"344530","348090"," I'm going to take a quick look here and find out what the fuck is going on. "
"351570","353110"," Why I'm not showing this stuff."
"354650","355370"," So we'll do it together."
"355570","355850"," We'll do it together. "
"355930","356530"," We've got some time."
"356670","360950"," It's 9.17. Sometimes I have these."
"384950","388230"," I've got something for you as well this morning, a winky face. "
"388450","389110"," I'm free to look at."
"391830","393570"," I thought I did this the other day with you."
"393670","394530"," So we'll do it together. "
"395310","396690"," You guys can do this at home."
"400650","402810"," I'm just going to bring up SPX."
"406450","407270"," This is not a weekly. "
"408150","409650"," Actually, we can stand the weekly briefly."
"410010","411830"," I want you guys to see something this morning."
"412950","414450"," So we can look at IWM. "
"421190","427070"," IWM can sometimes be a lead indicator for the market."
"430070","431930"," So just a weekly moving average."
"432390","439250"," You can see that we've broken below the weekly moving average on small caps. "
"439250","441970"," And it doesn't mean we can't go up here."
"444090","451610"," But it does serve as a gentle behind the scenes reminder that whenever we break below this weekly"
"451610","454870"," moving average, it's cause for concern in the market."
"457010","458390"," It's a simple indicator. "
"459450","460810"," We're under weekly moving average."
"461230","462530"," You know, we can move up from here to."
"465630","471590"," But we do break below this weekly moving average and we can see some destruction below it. "
"473050","476970"," Especially in some of the worst and in some of the uglier times."
"477790","479130"," It's kind of crazy too, right?"
"479250","480090"," You see this move here."
"481010","483290"," This is back in 2008. "
"485760","492160"," And you see this one weekly bar right here where we kind of squeezed higher real quick."
"494440","498380"," And then we began a vicious move lower on the weekly moving average."
"499540","502680"," And you can see this play out as well back here in 2000. "
"503720","508640"," If you were to look on the rut going back historically, you'd see the same thing."
"510040","514840"," This isn't showing itself quite yet in the S&P 500."
"516299","522120"," But of note would be kind of spikes higher for seeing that right selling into pressure. "
"522600","526600"," And I'm going to move into why I'm talking about the IWM today and why it matters."
"529690","531110"," So we'll look at SPX."
"533670","537010"," And what I'm thinking is going on at least in the background. "
"539250","544590"," So we're going to we're going to draw some simple lines here."
"544590","553310"," We're coming into the new year and I'm going to show you the JPM caller once again."
"555310","556470"," This isn't going to be perfect. "
"557390","558430"," I know you guys want perfect."
"558610","560730"," You guys can perfect this on your own."
"560850","562010"," I'll just write it in for you. "
"562010","565210"," So we've got March."
"573850","575710"," We've got March 31st right here outside."
"577130","578210"," We're going to go to the daily. "
"582030","584150"," We're going to stay in this topic here for a minute."
"584710","587330"," So there's March 31st."
"595300","595880"," Excuse me. "
"595960","597080"," I'm trying to drink water."
"597860","611870"," Okay, so we've got 3060 down here and we've got short 3060"
"611870","612130"," P."
"614410","615550"," We'll make that larger."
"616410","617910"," Yes, we can make that larger 20. "
"618530","619370"," So you can see it."
"621810","623610"," Make that four points right there."
"624170","626150"," Short 3060 P, right?"
"626370","632650"," Then we've got a long 3630 P."
"649020","650260"," We're also going to write in magnet. "
"652680","653720"," Just so you can see it."
"653820","654340"," This is the magnet."
"654560","654720"," Okay. "
"655200","655980"," There's a little hover towards."
"656140","658720"," Remember, you know how we come into the end of a quarter and you're like, oh, we're going to trade"
"658720","659660"," right back to the magnet."
"660280","661540"," And everybody talks about that. "
"661680","662680"," There's the magnet right there."
"675290","676170"," This isn't perfect."
"676330","677470"," This should be a little bit higher. "
"677890","681830"," We'll clean this up later, but you get the gist."
"691680","695280"," And you've got four or six, five short, four or six, five up here."
"698320","703400"," Now, what this is telling you is, or what, what, not what this is telling you, but what the market"
"703400","714200"," is doing is this, okay, is markets basically"
"714200","715100"," telling you that. "
"716240","717760"," That is coming to the beginning of the year."
"719320","720660"," You've got a cell."
"720880","724640"," You've got GPM saying we're going to sell this market above. "
"726640","727740"," It's JPM selling."
"727940","729080"," We're going to, I want to make this red."
"731140","731880"," JPM selling. "
"732080","733480"," We're going to, we're going to sell this market above."
"736060","737000"," That's the telling you."
"737480","739400"," Like if you get up here, we're going to sell it. "
"739920","744940"," If you get up here higher, if we trade like up here, we're going to, we're going to step right"
"744940","746640"," in and start to sell this market down."
"747540","748160"," Put the telling you."
"748920","751520"," And in their, at least in their color. "
"753580","758760"," Now, they're also telling you that they will buy below down here."
"761720","765780"," At some point, they'll buy down here, okay?"
"767440","768320"," So make that green."
"776530","782290"," And they're also telling you that we're probably going to magnet to this, this area over here. "
"784490","785010"," Come."
"787530","788350"," And a quarter."
"789790","791250"," It's pretty simple, right?"
"792450","794650"," Now, could we go straight down right now?"
"794670","795110"," Yes. "
"795390","800530"," And then trade blast higher and then, you know, could the path be something that's just bloodbath"
"800530","801110"," down here?"
"802210","804070"," Then, then up there, yeah, but that's possible."
"809430","812190"," Do we know we're coming into earnings season and."
"814090","816090"," You know, people, they're actually buying. "
"816910","818030"," I'll show you that later."
"818230","820450"," I'll say that there's some accumulation going on in here."
"822070","826970"," But what is happening is you're seeing the accumulation for earnings. "
"829010","831350"," And put buyers not caring."
"831690","832670"," They really don't care."
"832850","835650"," They're like, we don't care if you go up to four, six, five. "
"836210","837850"," I'm just going to place my bets for the quarter."
"839050","840670"," It's going to tamper all of this."
"841950","847370"," And here because they know that they don't care if we go up here because if they missed the"
"847370","852510"," opportunity to grab that, that put spread or that short or whatever in the market, and their view"
"852510","856690"," is we're going down here, at least at some point this next three months. "
"857170","857790"," So they don't care."
"858470","860010"," Placing all their bets right now."
"861210","863870"," You're seeing this tightness in the market right here. "
"864630","866130"," You're seeing the."
"866830","870490"," IWM small caps leading saying we're heading down below."
"871210","872450"," It sounds logical. "
"873550","876950"," On a normal circumstance, those you would expect us to just squeeze up higher."
"877570","879230"," And I still think that we do squeeze up higher."
"882110","883630"," Though I'm assuming I put a."
"886130","887750"," I always forget where the. "
"887990","894780"," I don't know why when I'm trading view, I always seem to forget where the path is."
"894780","895240"," There it is."
"896020","899440"," So, you know, likely it's something like this. "
"901520","905080"," You know, at some point, well, I always fuck this up and I do this with you guys."
"905820","907060"," Double or something like that."
"907740","910960"," Something like this is what you're going to expect. "
"913660","916320"," And there are people out there that don't care if we go up high here."
"916380","917900"," They don't care if we start selling now."
"918020","918820"," They don't care if we squeeze. "
"919940","924760"," And you remember that looking at that."
"925460","927640"," That kind of makes sense with here again, right?"
"927760","929920"," If we were to do something like this and start to trade lower."
"930880","935240"," Now, we don't always trade where IWM collar goes in previous years. "
"935400","935900"," We haven't."
"936720","938460"," It's not it's not a predicted path."
"938620","941500"," It hasn't been the past year to two years. "
"942780","948760"," And it's worked for the past, at least quite well, the past year and a half."
"948760","950980"," I want to say somewhere in there by the year and a half."
"952200","953760"," And so this is what people are predicting. "
"954480","958760"," Now you got a ton of puts coming into the market from retailers."
"960440","968600"," And then you've got accumulation by banks for some kind of an ER move up in different sectors."
"968720","969980"," I'll show you those sectors today. "
"971100","972360"," So nothing's really changed."
"972620","974680"," Nothing's changed since Monday or Tuesday."
"975220","976800"," Nothing has changed since Friday. "
"977600","982560"," So it's all a matter of taste for you when you're going to put your put hedge on."
"982900","986700"," If you're going to put one on or not, is it going to be right here?"
"987640","991880"," In case we have this quick rollover, is it going to be above up here?"
"992580","996920"," One way or another, retailers are out there placing their hedges now."
"997680","1003600"," We saw the selling into strength on the second or two days ago. "
"1004080","1005460"," And we saw it again yesterday."
"1005460","1011800"," Now, yesterday's Fed meeting was, if you remember the last livestream that I did with you, so I'm"
"1011800","1012520"," going to leave you with this."
"1013600","1021960"," If you see anything that is overly, overly hawkish, expect us to start blood-bathting it down. "
"1022760","1027880"," And I don't hawkish, excuse me, a dovish to see us start blood-bathting it down."
"1028500","1034260"," We didn't get a hawkish or, excuse me, a dovish fed yesterday."
"1034260","1039940"," And so we got the Fed that's telling you we're staying the course, right?"
"1040380","1043680"," So we didn't see a blood-bath from a dovish fed yesterday. "
"1045760","1046440"," That all."
"1046640","1047920"," And you're going to be expecting that."
"1048100","1055740"," When the Fed gets dovish, you're going to start to see the market should start to sell off at some"
"1055740","1058200"," point with conviction. "
"1059240","1060860"," How low that is, I have no idea."
"1061360","1063160"," I'm looking for an employment myself."
"1065650","1071450"," But the thought process here is, how high do we go for ER season?"
"1072410","1073630"," We are below pivot right now. "
"1073990","1076490"," Yesterday's close was ultra bullish."
"1076770","1084360"," If you look at an hourly from yesterday, this isn't showing up right now."
"1084440","1088860"," But yesterday, yesterday, as we went into this close yesterday, that blue line came up. "
"1089380","1090640"," This is the blue line you want to be seeing."
"1090640","1092820"," We were blasting above the green line right here."
"1093340","1095260"," And it was looking amazing yesterday. "
"1095260","1096440"," Now not so much, right?"
"1098140","1101280"," When I looked at the close yesterday, I didn't trade it at the internet."
"1101280","1102080"," It still wasn't on."
"1102600","1108820"," When I looked at that close yesterday, I was like, man, I was like, this is going to be a"
"1108820","1109680"," good overnight. "
"1109860","1110520"," It's going to blast."
"1110880","1114140"," And they just sold cash, cash market yesterday."
"1115780","1118220"," So they're looking for some liquidity to go up more than likely. "
"1120520","1125140"," So we're at the three, we're sitting at the spot to calm down a little bit here."
"1133800","1136700"," And the other thing of note today would be the range expansion."
"1137080","1139380"," You're going to expect larger moves. "
"1140200","1141860"," I meant to bring that up with you this morning as well."
"1143660","1144880"," We have range expansion."
"1145260","1148720"," So you'll see these one, two, three dollar moves. "
"1149380","1152660"," Ten point moves will be nothing with range expansion today."
"1160650","1162630"," And I've got something special for Winky."
"1163850","1165530"," I'm going to show Winky here in just a minute. "
"1165650","1168130"," Winky, did you get a chance to see Larry Williams?"
"1169050","1173430"," I didn't get to watch all of them yesterday or this morning."
"1175980","1178900"," I saw his video at like seven o'clock this morning."
"1186670","1189250"," So I've only made it through half the video at this point. "
"1190470","1192170"," So we're going to talk about Larry Williams."
"1195190","1200490"," This is for any of you with the TLT trade in the gold trade."
"1200550","1202290"," I'm going to give you a couple of things this morning. "
"1204090","1206130"," So we're going to talk about gold."
"1208170","1209650"," I got some cool for you."
"1210350","1212750"," Dude, this guy Larry Williams, man, he's got. "
"1215390","1216150"," He's got."
"1219960","1221220"," So many nuggets."
"1222160","1224280"," First he was complaining that. "
"1224460","1228340"," First he was complaining that he's not a guru."
"1229020","1230160"," I'm like, he's not a guru."
"1230920","1231560"," Like no one calls me. "
"1231640","1234260"," He's like, people can email me and call me a guru."
"1234520","1235260"," And I'm like, he's not a guru."
"1235860","1240660"," Just a really high probability trader, which is what you want to be. "
"1240800","1241980"," It's what you're kind of aiming for."
"1242340","1243580"," So this is gold futures."

"1315690","1318570"," It was really cool because I was able to find this really cool."
"1318570","1322530"," I was able to find spots and see this low here."
"1324330","1327650"," I was like, man, I was like, this is a great indicator for gold. "
"1329450","1333050"," This is a daily chart."
"1333290","1334530"," It seemed to work really well."
"1336970","1339430"," So if you're a gold bug out there, if you're looking at trade gold. "
"1342550","1344150"," For short term holds."
"1345850","1347750"," It seemed to do really well."
"1349130","1352790"," And then it even seemed to do really well on long term holds of gold. "
"1353250","1354150"," You can see right here, right?"
"1354550","1355070"," It's pretty cool."
"1355830","1357330"," One, two, three, four, five, six."
"1358650","1359910"," This is on a daily chart. "
"1360790","1361970"," And then on a weekly chart."
"1363170","1365310"," We'll see if I can clear all the drawings here."
"1369270","1374270"," So this is an open interest indicator on gold futures. "
"1375330","1376950"," It doesn't work on GLD."
"1377250","1382130"," But it at least gives you a target for when to start longing when you see this happen."
"1382710","1384490"," You can see we're kind of high right now in gold. "
"1384670","1386390"," So you might not want to be buying gold today."
"1387530","1391170"," But you could probably set a trigger or an alert for yourself."
"1391870","1398810"," Another cool part is if you look at a weekly, you kind of get the same feeling here, right?"
"1399270","1401250"," We're overbought on gold right now. "
"1401250","1406010"," But some great indicators of when to buy gold on a weekly."
"1407170","1412610"," I haven't looked at it yet on a one hour or anything like that for our chart."
"1416270","1417950"," You know, it's still not ready, right?"
"1418210","1419610"," This is a one hour chart. "
"1419810","1422790"," Everything's telling you to actually buy puts on gold today."
"1423990","1425210"," That's what's telling you."
"1425470","1428230"," But I want you to on your own go get that open interest indicator. "
"1428850","1430950"," Check out gold, especially if you're looking for."
"1430950","1433950"," A safe trade into 2023."

"1441390","1444250"," And inflation coming up and down through 2023."
"1444770","1447710"," This might be one of the indicators you should be looking at."
"1449270","1454210"," For short term trades, like one, two day trades looking for a bottom and open interest. "
"1456310","1462820"," And keep an eye on that."
"1464700","1466140"," Open up trade and view."
"1467100","1474560"," Go check out GLD future or gold, not good GLD, but GLD futures as the ticker. "
"1475500","1477900"," And then search for the indicator open interest."
"1478280","1478700"," It works."
"1479180","1479220"," Awesome. "
"1480140","1481560"," I was still looking at it."
"1486460","1488820"," Yeah, I don't, I don't."
"1490080","1491460"," I don't think this is on. "
"1491680","1494140"," I think this is, I don't know who wrote this, the open interest."
"1494220","1496020"," I think this is just a house open interest."
"1497980","1499180"," Indicator on trading view. "
"1500200","1501660"," And it matched up perfectly."
"1503320","1505660"," I don't think anyone's written it on trading view either."
"1505660","1508200"," I think it's, and it doesn't work on every indicator. "
"1508460","1511120"," That indicator doesn't work on every ticker."
"1511340","1513580"," It doesn't work on the GLD ticker."
"1514100","1514900"," It doesn't work. "
"1515080","1519300"," It doesn't have the information, but it does have the information on, or at least the data on gold."
"1536360","1540940"," Yeah, I'd be, I'd be looking at, um, I'd be looking at that indicator."
"1541300","1543720"," Like take a moment, go, go get on trade. "
"1543920","1544220"," It's free."
"1544400","1545360"," Just go on trade and view."
"1546540","1549160"," We've got open interest and it's baller. "
"1550940","1552140"," It's straight baller."
"1561230","1562310"," I mean, just a second here."
"1572540","1574060"," And I might have one more for you. "
"1574120","1574540"," Give me a second."
"1586320","1588280"," I'm going to switch over to the five minute for you."
"1613160","1613940"," Hold on here. "
"1645480","1657750"," Yeah, I was looking to see if the checking the"
"1657750","1666750"," US 20 year to see if it would, if this open interest would work on the US 20 year."
"1669690","1673430"," As a TLT indicator, but it's not, it's not, it's not working on that one."
"1676770","1678270"," Yeah, let me see. "
"1725490","1730350"," You've got, uh, both composite PMI final and the prior reader 44 spot six."

"1735850","1740010"," There's the energy prices and free cashflow for upstream oil and gas sector in 2023. "
"1740250","1742150"," Will not reach their 2022 levels."
"1745600","1748360"," We've got a bunch of fed shit smearing on the walls."
"1748660","1751660"," We've got both six saying despite signs that prices are moderating. "
"1751660","1753060"," There's still a lot of work to be done."
"1753060","1755080"," The greatest, hold on a second here."
"1760680","1762780"," It's been warming up considerably here. "
"1762880","1766820"," So we've got, uh, pollen and mold and whatever in the air outside."
"1768360","1774780"," The Fed's Bostik is saying this morning that, uh, does not discuss current policy views and brief"
"1774780","1775660"," opening remark here."
"1775660","1780160"," You didn't discuss, uh, current policy views and opening remarks to the Atlanta Fed research"
"1780160","1780680"," conference. "
"1781780","1786400"," Uh, that Bostik also officials remain determined to beat inflation."
"1787240","1790100"," The greatest stops to go to the U S economy is inflation."
"1791200","1792480"," I E it's not inflation. "
"1792920","1796480"," It's, uh, unemployment or employment, we should say."
"1797120","1799040"," Despite signs that prices are moderating."
"1799120","1800380"," There's still a lot of work to be done. "
"1801880","1808960"," Some other news is that, uh, Fed swaps rate, uh, raises rises as high as 5.07 for June 2023"
"1808960","1809400"," contracts."
"1810060","1815260"," Uh, feds George said that I don't see something on the verge of blowing up in the financial system."
"1815260","1817780"," I'd be wary of feds George saying that. "
"1819580","1826280"," Uh, Fed, uh, uh, feds George also said this morning, uh, there are economic risks when the Fed"
"1826280","1828100"," raises interest rates."
"1828520","1832200"," Recent inflation data shows welcoming signs of pressure easing."
"1832640","1835920"," It's very important for the Fed to continue to reduce the balance sheet. "
"1836480","1838160"," That's kind of funny too, because they're not."
"1838880","1844320"," Uh, the Fed still has a lot to learn about how balance sheet policy works."
"1844320","1847180"," I find that very humorous. "
"1848300","1854400"," I read an article yesterday about the, uh, about how many or how many billions they're trying to"
"1854400","1855560"," roll off the balance sheet."
"1856060","1858660"," Every month and how many they actually have rolled off."
"1859380","1861160"," Those numbers are not matching. "

"2017940","2018080"," 24. "
"2018480","2019620"," Come to the PMI at 45."
"2020300","2020380"," 45."
"2022980","2031580"," And watch through the, uh, watch through the IWM part, the SPX part and then the gold part. "
"2031580","2036420"," As soon as you're done with the gold part, jump right forward to the, uh, the live stream again."
"2036900","2038060"," Uh, the current live stream."
"2040520","2041400"," All right. "
"2041480","2042620"," Let's see what you guys are saying this morning."
"2043280","2047860"," This market is dumb yesterday pumps and sells and pumps again dumps pumps overnight and dumps."
"2048580","2049380"," Uh, good morning. "
"2049380","2049860"," Good morning."
"2049960","2054400"," Findings in this report here is fractional fall in activity recorded at the end of 2022."
"2054780","2055760"," It's inflation rates down. "
"2055960","2059219"," It's still high in employment and a long period of jobs growth."
"2062860","2063400"," All right."
"2063500","2064639"," I'd be a massive head and shoulders. "
"2065000","2065120"," Yeah."
"2065320","2072550"," You know, there's like this, um, when we get to, I should have, I should, I don't have the service"
"2072550","2074909"," sector remained inside contractionary territory."
"2076210","2077350"," Let me see if I can find it. "
"2087780","2094060"," So activity and new orders fall at sharper rates as demand wanes, cost burdens, rises, soft, at the"
"2094060","2097100"," softest pace for over two years, and employment growth only marginal."
"2098760","2103180"," The U.S. service provided signal day sharp pool and business activity at the end of the year."
"2103180","2109700"," According to the latest data output levels declined further amid weak demand conditions and another"
"2109700","2111080"," monthly job in new orders. "
"2112300","2113800"," I'll bring something up for you guys."
"2117300","2122480"," We have posted the US S&P services PMI final for December on the feed for those interested."
"2149280","2150920"," Bring something up for you right now. "
"2152980","2156720"," This is from Yahoo news yesterday."
"2159380","2161180"," The name of it, you can get this on your own."
"2161260","2162260"," It's called the stock market reading. "
"2162260","2163060"," So bearish."
"2163140","2163520"," It's bullish."
"2168620","2171760"," Everyone would that is when everyone thinks that where we're keep going down. "
"2171760","2174540"," Sometimes it's a contrarian indicator that we might be going up."
"2176340","2179040"," We know that I'm showing that right now, right?"
"2181000","2185260"," The interesting part about this article is so it says Wall Street is bearish."
"2185260","2186000"," This is bullish. "
"2186280","2188740"," We'll be of a sativa."
"2189000","2189280"," September."
"2190040","2190600"," Mary Ann. "
"2191260","2197420"," The Wall Street's consensus equity allocation has been a reliable contrarian indicator over time."
"2197600","2201620"," In other words, it has been a bullish signal and Wall Street strategist."
"2201620","2204360"," We're extremely bearish and vice versa. "
"2211420","2215620"," The current levels of the south side indicator suggest an expected price."
"2219900","2221860"," Return of 16% over 12 months."
"2222080","2224080"," Historically, when the indicator was that current levels are below. "
"2225000","2227840"," The stocks were higher a year later, 95% of the time."
"2229320","2231420"," Well, one issue I would take with this."
"2231500","2232300"," Here it is right here. "
"2234040","2235940"," The one issue I would take with this."
"2236060","2240640"," Basically, what the saying is we have such bearish readings right now."
"2241400","2244000"," That you should be positioned long. "
"2245000","2252860"," What this doesn't account for is what this doesn't account for is this last little drop here."
"2252860","2257760"," That's my only concern is we're set up for that last drop beginning of the year."
"2257900","2264660"," We're set up for it probably in the fall and winter to make that last little plunge here. "
"2266100","2267420"," Take a look at this on your own."
"2267560","2273400"," If you have time, I think you just Google search a stock market reading so bearish it's bullish."
"2275620","2276880"," Another sentiment measured closely. "
"2277100","2280580"," Watch the Wall Street is the American Association of Investors Weekly survey."
"2281020","2282680"," The survey is latest reading for the weekend."
"2282880","2285920"," It showed 47% of investors were bearish. "
"2286420","2289000"," Well above the historical average of 31%."
"2291120","2297080"," The surveys most bearish recent reading was 60.9% for the week of September 21st, 2022."
"2298240","2303260"," The SP is low for the year was reached on October 12th. "
"2303260","2310080"," We get that last little blast down during this quarter, the March quarter."
"2310240","2311120"," But take a look at that on your own."
"2312160","2314000"," I see what you think of this indicator here. "
"2314620","2317420"," If you want to take a look at that on your own time, I guess."
"2323140","2324060"," Good morning Ross."
"2324320","2324620"," How are you?"
"2326720","2328400"," And we'll take a look at one more thing this morning. "
"2328920","2330300"," I'll bring this back up for you."
"2331880","2333700"," And this is where you've got retail."
"2333780","2337420"," This is reinforcing that same concept. "
"2340180","2343460"," We're in super bearish or indicators, right?"
"2343580","2345680"," I spent, I think, two or what day is today?"
"2345840","2347620"," We don't even know what day today is right now."
"2347740","2348960"," It's sweet, spent so weird."
"2349520","2350060"," So it tastes Thursday. "
"2351080","2354420"," On Tuesday night, I talked to Chaz or daytime."
"2355380","2356780"," I've been talking to Chaz all day."
"2356980","2358300"," And then into the night, I talked to him. "
"2358300","2361540"," And he's like, why does everything look so bearish?"
"2361740","2370000"," And we talked about it at length that on Friday, we were throwing pistons in the market."
"2370660","2374040"," And I think it was Friday or Thursday, whatever the end of the year was."
"2375160","2379760"," And under normal, we saw a huge blast down in DIA. "
"2381120","2384700"," And I was talking to him, I think, on Thursday or Friday, I was like, man, I was like, any"
"2384700","2386860"," other time, this wasn't the first of the year."
"2386860","2388480"," We'd be blasting down."
"2389360","2392480"," And then two days ago on Tuesday, same thing. "
"2392700","2396320"," Two days ago on Tuesday, I'm like, you know, we've got this."
"2397720","2401660"," We've got these readings that are extremely bearish."
"2402240","2403420"," Saw apple blast down. "
"2404260","2405720"," I had trying to tag that one 20."
"2408480","2415500"," And in the back of my mind, my mind is just, or I've got that, like, spidey sense of extreme"
"2415500","2415860"," fear."
"2417860","2421660"," But so you, as a retailer, you're scared, right?"
"2421900","2423440"," You're like, man, this isn't good. "
"2426020","2428840"," So we're going to look at what's going on under the hood."
"2429720","2433040"," And it's very fascinating what's going on under the hood right now."
"2435940","2439060"," So as a retailer, you're like, man, I'm super bearish here. "
"2439060","2448460"," But under the hood, at least, there's been rotation."
"2453680","2458200"," Under the hood that you're seeing, this rotation trade still taking place."
"2458940","2462640"," We didn't see an extreme reading of, oh, an extreme low over here. "
"2463340","2466200"," And look, we've just traded sideways this entire time."
"2466200","2475120"," And we've actually grown the institutions have been buying in what looks like bearish readings,"
"2475120","2475540"," right?"
"2476660","2481800"," And if you look on the accumulation, we've got utilities going back up."
"2482140","2490240"," We've got real estate rates going back up, materials going up, industrials going up, healthcare,"
"2490720","2493280"," FinTech, financials. "
"2494020","2495900"," We knew about financials a few days ago."
"2496380","2497560"," Energy has rolled off."
"2500140","2508100"," We're seeing like a rotation, this is more of a rotation trade than anything else. "
"2509080","2514060"," So where this looks super bearish, I can show you that this is being accumulated."
"2515100","2516900"," You can say that this is being accumulated."
"2516900","2526600"," And I'll show you, I want to show you two other indicators, price percent and price oscillator. "
"2528400","2536060"," And you can see, at least on the daily, that there's an attempt right now to rebuy this market."
"2536320","2542780"," There's at least an attempt going on where they're trying to, you know, hook this back up."
"2542780","2551060"," And even if it's just for an entrance into the ER, into ER season. "
"2552140","2555620"," So I'd be wary of not being able to buy a dip in here."
"2555700","2562100"," Matter of fact, I've bought calls or I've bought calls a couple of days ago for the 20th on a"
"2562100","2563280"," squeeze higher here."
"2564460","2569680"," Even if we eventually roll over, I'm looking for that squeeze higher and then that roll over. "
"2570460","2571580"," Something more like this."
"2571780","2573080"," And there's an attempt in the background."
"2573420","2578480"," There's an accumulation in the background going on, even though we're bearish today, right?"
"2578660","2579600"," Everybody's all doom and gloom. "
"2581120","2588180"," We've been rotating sideways for, you know, a matter of time now, right?"
"2589840","2597720"," One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine sessions of rotation sideways."
"2599300","2607500"," Bearish readings on IWM, price percent oscillator price percent momentum."
"2608720","2615720"," And then we know that the banks are buying this. "
"2616380","2620080"," So be wary of the thought that we're going down here."
"2623820","2626180"," Every indicator saying that this is just being bought."
"2626980","2628380"," All these dips are being bought. "
"2629360","2631660"," We saw the dip get bought yesterday with the FMC meeting."
"2632240","2635060"," We saw the FMC saying they're staying the course."
"2635840","2639040"," We didn't see a davish fed yesterday. "
"2647320","2653000"," So if you're looking to put a put spread on, you know, you can put it on now."
"2653040","2654100"," It's not going to make much difference."
"2654480","2661540"," But if we were to trade higher into this 395, 4000, I'm going to assume it's not going to be"
"2661540","2664120"," irrational, but still see that. "
"2666460","2668180"," Which I think most of you are looking for, right?"
"2668260","2673140"," I think most of you are most of the bulls are looking for that trade higher."
"2675700","2679960"," If we trade up there, I would tell you, don't be getting burrows up there."
"2680000","2681860"," I'd be getting really bearish at that point. "
"2705900","2706660"," Dixie higher."
"2707840","2709200"," Nothing changed for two weeks."
"2709400","2710340"," Oh, well, good morning, everyone. "
"2710680","2710700"," Brian."
"2710700","2711640"," Watch your goat start."
"2711900","2714160"," FX chart and increased chart yesterday towards end of video. "
"2715640","2716960"," 325 was goat area."
"2717420","2718880"," Or did y'all go yesterday?"
"2719960","2720760"," Had to hang with Brian."
"2720760","2720980"," Wow. "
"2721160","2722060"," Well, I closed the six."
"2722620","2723060"," That's my cause."
"2723300","2723320"," Nice. "
"2723480","2724020"," Private went long."
"2724180","2725960"," Mclh contracts the lower extreme edge."
"2727160","2728220"," Oh, so yesterday I had a."
"2729380","2730040"," I lost internet. "
"2730780","2731040"," My house."
"2731040","2733400"," They had a car accident or something."
"2734300","2735980"," At least that's what my wife told me. "
"2742740","2745580"," I spent the day yesterday with some people on the phone."
"2791640","2791780"," I'm not sure."
"2791920","2792140"," I'm sorry. "
"2792140","2792200"," I'm sorry."
"2792200","2792240"," I'm sorry."
"2792240","2792280"," I'm sorry. "
"2792280","2792300"," I'm sorry."
"2801960","2804240"," I'd be wary of oil right now."
"2806580","2808780"," I'm not bullish on oil. "
"2811040","2813740"," Or I'd say that I'm bullish on oil."
"2815600","2816660"," Like this."
"2818520","2820120"," I'm bullish on oil like this. "
"2820660","2821900"," So if you're buying the decline."
"2824120","2827400"," You could get bullish, but I'm very bearish on oil right now."
"2834380","2835680"," That's pretty 100%. "
"2835680","2836500"," Give me the money."
"2836860","2838060"," I haven't seen a new video for him."
"2839540","2841520"," So, so I was wondering about all the venerable. "
"2841900","2844140"," He was not looking at variables he was not looking at."
"2844260","2845620"," Yeah, there were some parts of what he said."
"2846100","2849820"," There were some parts of what Larry said this morning or last night. "
"2849920","2855600"," Whenever he made that video that really left a lot open to a larger down move."
"2857760","2859040"," I agree with that statement."
"2866180","2869380"," So you guys are right in the in the in the comment section. "
"2880660","2881300"," Morning Omar."
"2881480","2881840"," How are you?"
"2888240","2889580"," I'll be doing well Omar."
"2889880","2890480"," Good morning Lisa. "
"2890740","2891020"," How are you?"
"2895660","2896240"," Yeah, Mike."
"2896420","2900940"," I'll try to mute that the guy blabbing his mouth up in the background when I can."
"2901200","2902580"," I apologize for that. "
"2905280","2906200"," Morning El Marino."
"2906520","2908080"," You haven't got pancakes and coffee, brother."
"2913120","2914120"," Sativa Submarina. "
"2920160","2922540"," I said the same crap in 2000 2008."
"2929520","2930840"," Yeah, I'm trying to smell better."
"2930840","2935660"," It was funny to yesterday we had a yesterday. "
"2936820","2937340"," The."
"2939400","2940880"," When the unit did come back."
"2941080","2946020"," Well, of course that's often my children are on a in person on mind school. "
"2946960","2949200"," And they were just hoping for one more day off."
"2949200","2950300"," And then my wife."
"2951240","2952900"," Works as a kind of a doctor. "
"2953260","2953760"," She's like a."
"2953760","2955200"," A psychologist."
"2956460","2957060"," And I."
"2957880","2958940"," Three or four in the afternoon."
"2959100","2960860"," She said, is it time that I can have a bear yet?"
"2961000","2962760"," I'm like, I think you can have a bear at this point. "
"2971510","2972230"," Yeah, nope."
"2972590","2973330"," The gold trade."
"2973890","2975450"," I think I showed you guys the chart on gold. "
"2975610","2976310"," It's pretty consistent."
"2976850","2977670"," You just snap some lines."
"2981430","2982670"," It's pretty consistent. "
"2990330","2991790"," After the Santa window."
"2991790","2994250"," I don't expect anything above like three to seven."
"3000270","3001270"," Let's see what else. "
"3007650","3011710"," Even whatever ended with the official end of the Santa week, at least until after."
"3011850","3012510"," We'll see."
"3013110","3015870"," I'm usually a lot wrong and index level stuff. "
"3017010","3017630"," I think we get a pin."
"3017630","3019470"," I think we get the pen."
"3019710","3023190"," So we keep saying, I think the way to break 3D or whatever ended with the official end of Santa"
"3023190","3023510"," week. "
"3023810","3024910"," At least until after."
"3025110","3026070"," Opax, but we'll see."
"3026350","3027650"," I'm usually wrong and index level stuff. "
"3028250","3028450"," Yeah."
"3028770","3029230"," I think it's."
"3029490","3032490"," I don't know if I agree with that statement. "
"3032590","3034010"," I think that you'll see a move up."
"3034750","3035910"," Into ER season."
"3036490","3037450"," And then they'll pin it. "
"3037630","3039590"," I don't think the pen is in yet on ER's."
"3042930","3045750"," Looking to say is maybe we load X love calls for one 20."
"3047690","3049030"," CL was a great lead reload. "
"3049630","3049870"," Yeah."
"3049950","3050410"," I think you can."
"3052170","3053210"," Yeah, you're bullish and oil. "
"3054990","3059670"," I don't I don't mind being bullish and oil, but I would be a profit taker on oil or not"
"3059670","3060490"," a profit holder."
"3061230","3064510"," I guess that's a better way to explain my position on oil."
"3064750","3066790"," I think you can buy the dip on it, but I don't think it's. "
"3067370","3068870"," I think it's going to be on a decline."
"3070770","3073050"," Into 2024 2025."
"3078170","3079130"," Good morning, Cato. "
"3079370","3079630"," How are you?"
"3080310","3081850"," Do you actually fix these pumping?"
"3082370","3083010"," Good morning, Mike."
"3083230","3083470"," How are you?"
"3083730","3084170"," Good morning, Mike."
"3084170","3084710"," I'm a hash. "
"3084930","3085170"," How are you?"
"3085490","3086670"," Don't have to mute the background, guys."
"3087370","3088130"," It's just really loud."
"3088350","3088370"," Okay. "
"3088430","3088950"," I'll turn them down."
"3090110","3091050"," Thanks for the clarification."
"3092970","3093290"," I'll turn it. "
"3093570","3094710"," Just turn them down in the background."
"3097010","3097870"," To a dull roar."
"3099210","3099790"," Apple ripping. "
"3100190","3100610"," Good morning cap."
"3100890","3101670"," No snow here in the Alps."
"3102330","3102930"," Yeah. "
"3105530","3111290"," All that heat or warmth is coming here now for like extended warmth in where we are."
"3111430","3111950"," Everything's melting."
"3113250","3114370"," Water everywhere. "
"3120530","3122790"," I don't know what the what will."
"3123090","3124410"," Can you clarify your question on?"
"3124910","3127710"," So would you guys expect us by to happen before end of January?"
"3130450","3136950"," If you have putts for January, I would I would be rolling those into March, like March 17th."
"3139250","3140770"," You guys understand that, right?"
"3140930","3141710"," If you're going to put put. "
"3141890","3142670"," Well, not putts."
"3142750","3143910"," If you put put spreads on."
"3145390","3146170"," I'd put them out. "
"3146290","3149810"," I'd date them for like March 17th or if it was me, I would date them for like March 17th."
"3150410","3154510"," If I was going to buy puts for March, I would buy or for like between now and March, I"
"3154510","3156930"," would be buying them six months out."
"3165080","3168660"," Our spot is nothing compared to the landscape or blower revving outside my window. "
"3169880","3171380"," Nick asks, what do you want me to explain?"
"3171740","3173400"," Do you want to explain my bearishness and oil maybe?"
"3173700","3174020"," I don't know."
"3174360","3174740"," What you're asking?"
"3176220","3177580"," I can explain that if you want."
"3180360","3182620"," You know, show my bearishness and oil and why. "
"3184760","3185320"," I can do that."
"3189080","3189880"," I think I can."
"3191380","3192220"," We'll look at it. "
"3210790","3212130"," Mr. Van bring up."
"3214450","3215170"," Inflation."
"3218470","3219550"," New pain. "
"3222050","3223290"," Okay, you guys ready?"
"3224070","3224630"," Drum roll, please."
"3226170","3228250"," Why am I bearish on oil?"
"3228590","3229050"," I'll show you why."
"3230170","3232190"," I'm going to mute a book map here. "
"3237150","3237970"," Here you go."
"3240050","3242030"," And he is looking kind of familiar to you."
"3243690","3247070"," So this is, I'm going to mute my camera here. "
"3252370","3253370"," And I'm going to mute."
"3253930","3254390"," There we go."
"3255150","3257470"," So this is USO. "
"3258710","3260950"," You do this with oil, but this is USO."
"3261370","3263150"," Do you know what this is down here?"
"3264550","3266190"," This is inflation."
"3268410","3270330"," So though I do see. "
"3279670","3285590"," So though I do see, you know, if you see inflation rise, you're going to see the price of oil"
"3285590","3286250"," rise."
"3287510","3290690"," But if you look on, see if I can."
"3291310","3299700"," Let's do an auto. "
"3302900","3304260"," This is USO."
"3304380","3306060"," I could do oil if you wanted to."
"3308320","3309960"," Just crude or something. "
"3316960","3318560"," Let's see, WTI."
"3323020","3323820"," There."
"3333520","3334500"," And then inflation. "
"3335520","3336300"," New pain."
"3338900","3345520"," So you're going to expect spikes in inflation, but we should see rapid, rapid deflation in 2023."
"3345700","3348720"," So what's my take on oil?"
"3349040","3351240"," My take on oil is, yeah, you can buy it. "
"3352160","3353380"," On its way down."
"3353520","3356260"," But the trade is more than likely over the course of the year."
"3356680","3357020"," Down one. "
"3360720","3368780"," Unless you think that rates are going to be cut, or if you think that we're going to get, you"
"3368780","3370800"," know, a double dip inflation."
"3370860","3372400"," I think we'll get double dip inflation."
"3373260","3376860"," Like I think we'll get like a move down in inflation and then a double dip. "
"3377940","3382100"," But even so, you would expect oil to mimic that same move."
"3383000","3384760"," So you can buy the dips in oil."
"3385040","3391200"," So this isn't saying you can't buy the dips in oil, but your thesis would have to be that inflation"
"3391200","3399630"," is not only going to rear its ugly head, but that not only that inflation is going to rear its"
"3399630","3405330"," ugly head, but that it'll persist, which it isn't right now. "
"3405410","3405990"," It's coming down."
"3407010","3409490"," As a matter of fact, you're hearing of layoffs."
"3412030","3413770"," You're hearing of layoffs right now. "
"3413950","3416910"," So you're pulling into the idea of the world."
"3417190","3418130"," There's a Russia is going out."
"3418130","3424170"," Which means that the Fed has become 100 on January 7."
"3424530","3425110"," Here's my side. "
"3425250","3427030"," Move it in the S&P 500 and down side."
"3427430","3432950"," Again from the Kremlin, Russia to announce a truce in Ukraine from January 6, the January 7"
"3432950","3433830"," according to Interfax."
"3435090","3436630"," Oh, heads up. "
"3436810","3438010"," We've got a truce in Ukraine."
"3443790","3445490"," You could see a blast off."
"3445550","3449190"," One day Christmas truce in Ukraine again coming from Interfax here. "
"3449330","3450710"," That's from January 6 to 7."
"3451190","3453250"," Again, the Kremlin reported started by Interfax."
"3453410","3456970"," We haven't seen a truce in Ukraine at all in this war."
"3466630","3467390"," Hold on here. "
"3509780","3511700"," Just a warning to you out there."
"3512480","3514580"," We haven't seen many truces."
"3514580","3519440"," In the Kremlin, as Russia calls on the Ukrainian side to declare a ceasefire and allow people to"
"3519440","3522300"," attend services on Christmas Eve, as well as Christmas Day. "
"3528040","3529760"," Rumors of some kind of a ceasefire."
"3530840","3535220"," We haven't seen any kind of, I've got some calls set up here in case we blast north."
"3549340","3553460"," We haven't seen any kind of ceasefire or truces. "
"3554600","3561240"," Normally because Russia has used."
"3562050","3566960"," It typically uses a truce for troop movements."
"3568800","3577500"," If you hear about any kind of a truce, Ukraine, if you hear about Ukraine at any point, agreeing to"
"3577500","3584500"," a truce, it would imply that there might be some negotiations going on in the background. "
"3586980","3596600"," Ukraine has no reason to want a truce for Russia to reposition themselves."
"3608330","3612400"," It's a Christmas holiday for Ukraine and for Russia."
"3616520","3618580"," But you wouldn't normally see one as the point. "
"3619440","3623920"," Normally you would not see Ukraine wanting at any point to agree to a truce."
"3627520","3632400"," Unless there were some kind of negotiations, meaningful negotiations going on in the background."
"3637840","3639600"," Morning a trading shorts, how are you?"
"3639900","3641620"," I didn't know that you worked for Dan Gilbert. "
"3643360","3644160"," How was that?"
"3644480","3644940"," Did you make money?"
"3645880","3647920"," I've got some friends that have worked for him."
"3648840","3651020"," They did very well, but they worked their asses off."
"3651900","3654100"," I was meaning to ask you about that. "
"3655120","3659360"," It's been on my mind for about a week now or when I was the last time you said you"
"3659360","3659960"," had worked for Gilbert."
"3668440","3673940"," Yeah, there's, if you, so let me rehash what I said to you a few moments ago."
"3673940","3682020"," So there are rumors swirling about a possible truce between Russia and Ukraine. "
"3682740","3692060"," You want to warn you that Ukraine will not agree to any truce publicly unless,"
"3692760","3698980"," for no reason, they will not agree to a truce publicly unless there are some negotiations going on"
"3698980","3699760"," behind the zines."
"3700340","3706020"," So if you ever see Ukraine say, yeah, we'll agree with truce, for they can give whatever reason"
"3706020","3706340"," they want."
"3706500","3709040"," They can say it's Christmas or the Orthodox Church, it doesn't matter. "
"3710560","3717260"," But if they ever agree to one, that's usually a cover for some kind of negotiations that are being"
"3717260","3718260"," taken quite seriously."
"3721560","3730760"," Now, like Zelensky and Ukraine have stated ad nauseum that negotiations, they're going to have"
"3730760","3740320"," negotiations unless there's talk of leaving the dumb bass region, relieving a"
"3740320","3741120"," Crimea."
"3747120","3751860"," They're, they're negotiating or they're starting negotiations are quite high. "
"3760840","3769180"," So you guys are saying the Russian supply tracks are wrapping up exactly."
"3769180","3771800"," And I think Ukraine's fully aware of that."
"3772060","3781860"," If if there's any kind of a truce, the war is probably over because otherwise Russia's it's just"
"3781860","3782720"," repositioning. "
"3783560","3787180"," It's like let's let's bring in the supply trucks to continue the war."
"3801120","3802260"," So you guys are saying here."
"3803540","3804980"," Are you working as a banker for him?"
"3805160","3805440"," Right on. "
"3806140","3806160"," Yeah."
"3806700","3810940"," Gilbert's done a lot for the city of people hate it or he has a love hate relationship with the"
"3810940","3811180"," city."
"3812440","3816460"," People are like he shouldn't have bought it, you know, been able to buy all this land for cheap. "
"3817020","3818480"," He was the only guy doing it."
"3818640","3820100"," I mean, like, who else was doing it?"
"3821220","3822100"," There's just a couple."
"3822240","3827860"," There's just a few people that were buying the dip in Detroit. "
"3830400","3832600"," So I've got to, I don't know why they pitched."
"3832800","3836740"," I mean, I understand why they pitched so much, but very shrewd businessman."
"3852430","3854410"," They need to trash this thing, punish the bulls. "
"3857370","3859110"," 600k 2020 300k."
"3859490","3859490"," Yeah."
"3862190","3869050"," He, he, some of the properties that he got in Detroit, I'm so jealous. "
"3870590","3876530"," If I had got, I wish I had gotten here a decade ago, some wish I'd gotten a Detroit about"
"3876530","3879350"," a decade ago, some of the houses I could have bought."
"3880590","3884010"," As a matter of fact, when I got here, I should have bought more and held."
"3884430","3889570"," I should have bought and held and bought and held and bought and held and just paid the taxes. "
"3892910","3894510"," The property values here."
"3895630","3896610"," I keep reading these."
"3897950","3905550"," There's like, there are these like cookie cutter articles talk about how bad Detroit is, but. "
"3906650","3911770"," Or from looking at statistics, but if you, if you're on the ground, it grounded in Detroit, you're"
"3911770","3913710"," talking about going to auctions and getting."
"3914910","3923810"," $1,500 properties that are now worth like $30, $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 untouched, like"
"3923810","3925550"," shitholes."
"3926230","3931230"," Renovated houses that were going for four, four, four, five grand there. "
"3931790","3933710"," Two, $300,000 now."
"3934870","3938870"," And a decade ago, there were $1,000 properties that are now commanding."
"3940110","3941550"," Five, six, a million. "
"3943250","3945610"," So it's not even like a comparison."
"3946810","3950150"," To all I bought my house for 300 grand and now it's worth half a million."
"3950150","3960110"," It's not even the same, it's not even the same discussion, I guess, when you're talking like a"
"3960110","3963470"," 3,000, 5,000, 10,000 percent. "
"3965210","3969250"," Like a rate or increase in the price of a property."
"3972250","3973750"," So he made out like a bank robber."
"3982170","3989630"," If they just, if they just with, I think we talked about that on, on Tuesday or Friday, right?"
"3989810","3999610"," We said, or I was telling you guys about how the bankers keep offices more than likely keep offices"
"3999610","4001550"," in Ukraine and, and Russia. "
"4002730","4004130"," For any whiff of a truce."
"4006070","4012470"," If you hear, if you heard a Ukraine agreeing at any point to a truce, it's probably like a 90 "
"4012470","4017210","% chance that there, that it has something to do with a real true end of war."
"4022790","4025570"," He did work your ass off and took part in drinking the Kool-Aid. "
"4026710","4028530"," He's a core of 100."
"4028670","4029570"," He makes the punch bowl."
"4029710","4029950"," He throws the punch bowl. "
"4029950","4030950"," He throws the punch bowl."
"4031070","4032790"," That's 29 out of 100 signaling."
"4033070","4039650"," So that's, you know, I suppose the punch bowl is a, is a Duggan. "
"4039850","4041430"," Duggan fills the punch bowl too."
"4043090","4045210"," And they're nailing people right now."
"4045210","4053490"," So in Wayne County, you might have, they, they reassessed taxes in Wayne County. "
"4054030","4059970"," So you might have had a house that was once valued at, let's say, $100,000 and you're paying, I"
"4059970","4062930"," don't know, five, six grand in property taxes a year."
"4063330","4065850"," And they came back into Wayne County and reassessed."
"4066490","4069810"," So you have like a shithole that you're paying a thousand bucks a year on. "
"4069810","4075010"," And so everyone's renovating these houses and then they're selling them."
"4075610","4080590"," And the new owner comes in, gets, sees that the tax history is, you know, a thousand bucks or"
"4080590","4082270"," something, two grand a year."
"4083210","4087410"," And then the county, the county sees the new sale price, you know, 300 grand. "
"4088990","4094110"," And they, they slam them like these new buyers are like, what do you mean, my tax bill is $12 "
"4094110","4095270",",000 a year now."
"4097290","4098170"," It's insane."
"4108109","4109470"," One day, Christmas truce. "
"4109770","4110410"," Yeah, I don't know that."
"4110729","4115370"," If you, if you, I don't think Ukraine will agree to any truce unless there's."
"4115370","4117109"," That's kind of 30 a.m. Eastern time. "
"4117290","4119029"," We get EIA natural gas chain."
"4119149","4119910"," Four cars."
"4120729","4124270"," One the prior minus 213 BC. "
"4124609","4126410"," I don't think you need to get one day."
"4128410","4131590"," I think it's, I think that, that part, that's all over."
"4134859","4137560"," Are you soldiers just want to change charge their cell phones?"
"4138120","4139560"," I read that story too, Winky. "
"4140500","4144020"," They probably want to change their SIM cards more than they're charging, right?"
"4150840","4151439"," Toe cheese."
"4151760","4153479"," Ask a question about spreads and I'll answer it."
"4154439","4155080"," Morning them. "
"4155220","4155720"," How are you?"
"4159880","4161279"," He's in bad shape right now."
"4161460","4162020"," I didn't know that."
"4166319","4166800"," Yeah. "
"4166920","4173819"," So I've got my friends here in Detroit that are serious, or serious."
"4175840","4177899"," I got friends that are from mostly from California."
"4179439","4183580"," Mostly like Californians with outside the U.S. clients. "
"4185300","4189460"," And there are massing properties and they started in Detroit."
"4189880","4194280"," Now, or they, then they did Cleveland and now many out past three years."
"4194320","4198020"," Many apples has been the place to buy up mass properties. "
"4198840","4201660"," Now these aren't flip side of these are you buy them to rent them out."
"4202680","4208360"," And usually foreign investors, Europeans, Spain is a big place."
"4210540","4212200"," South America of all places. "
"4213720","4220120"," And they're using U.S. buyers to accumulate properties for pennies."
"4220780","4224000"," Not pennies, but, you know, pennies in terms of what you could buy elsewhere."
"4228680","4229080"," Yeah. "
"4229540","4230740"," So I don't think that you."
"4231140","4231540"," Yeah."
"4231700","4234600"," So what is your address that's 5k per house with new roof, but I don't. "
"4234700","4235600"," I wouldn't want to live there."
"4235780","4240080"," I don't think that I think that if you haven't been to it's weird too."
"4240220","4241520"," I'll meet people from out. "
"4241800","4245600"," Like so people from the suburbs of Detroit are like the traits of shithole to hell."
"4246340","4252020"," And mostly I think that's jaded from being from here."
"4252020","4255320"," I don't want to say that, but that's true. "
"4255660","4258800"," I think if you're objective and you if you travel, if you've lived."
"4259520","4265920"," Other places you you've spent time in New York and LA San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, anywhere"
"4265920","4266260"," Austin."
"4266260","4270120"," I don't care where it is Boston, any city. "
"4270700","4276020"," And then you come to Detroit, you're going to be like, Oh shit, it's nothing like that's portrayed."
"4276020","4278860"," I think some of that still has to do with."
"4281240","4286640"," Detroit doesn't want to lose the perception of we need help or we need investment, which they do"
"4286640","4290440"," their schools are or the elementary school system is horrible. "
"4293880","4295700"," The infrastructure for."
"4298100","4300420"," Mass transportation is not good."
"4301860","4303140"," Other than that. "
"4304240","4306520"," Those are the two glaring ones."
"4308020","4312420"," Some of their power infrastructure is is a tough nut."
"4313220","4318080"," But outside of that you could go I could go to parts of Detroit that look as nice or nicer"
"4318080","4321260"," than most US cities. "
"4322780","4325900"," And if you're older, you'll you I'm older."
"4326160","4332180"," So I've seen what New York looks like when it's a fucking shithole and I've seen when Boston was a"
"4332180","4334160"," shithole like the combat zone and all that."
"4334780","4339680"," And so being older, I just look at Detroit and I'm like that's just another city that's going to. "
"4340520","4346980"," In 20 years, you'll see whatever new generation will be whining that they can't buy a house here."
"4347740","4350660"," They only need a whether you agree or disagree with this."
"4351460","4356000"," There is an EV tech revolution going on here in Detroit amongst the big automakers. "
"4357380","4362300"," So if you were to see us an EV revolution take place in Detroit."
"4363220","4369460"," You know, it'll just be like a Portland was like, you know, the decade two decades ago or Seattle"
"4369460","4373300"," or you can name the city Austin, Boston, New York."
"4373760","4374900"," And then people will bitch. "
"4375020","4376800"," Matter of fact, I used to live in Santa Monica."
"4378440","4379640"," I used to live in LA, right?"
"4379860","4386820"," There are parts of LA where if you went to Venice in the 80s, it was a war zone."
"4387700","4389980"," You know, you didn't know I wanted to live there. "
"4390500","4394400"," And then of course now you got people that are like, why can't I afford to live in Venice?"
"4395260","4399920"," So whatever you hear people bitching or people saying this place is bad or whatever."
"4402060","4405140"," They'll be bitching when it's bad and they'll be bitching when it's great, right?"
"4405340","4406080"," I can't live there."
"4406780","4409760"," And when it's bad, I don't want to live there. "
"4410440","4415620"," So I don't listen to those comments too frequently and put much weight on to them."
"4417500","4425080"," At 10.30 a.m. Eastern time, we get EIA natural gas change forecast minus 240 BCF on the prior"
"4425080","4427500"," minus 213 BCF."
"4429280","4431120"," It was a full on frat house in the office. "
"4431340","4431840"," I believe it."
"4432400","4433400"," I believe it was."
"4433940","4436900"," I can't believe you were there during that time. "
"4437080","4441380"," I begged my wife to move here during that time when it was a real war zone."
"4442680","4447420"," I meet these guys that work for me and say own houses in Detroit."
"4447920","4452160"," And some of these guys will be like, dude, you have no idea how bad this neighborhood was. "
"4452720","4454240"," And I'm like impossible."
"4455240","4456460"," Couldn't have been that bad."
"4456900","4463300"," My friends will be like, my friends now, like people I've met that work for me now renovating"
"4463300","4463540"," houses. "
"4464680","4469320"," They'll be like that house over there in the corner that's no longer there."
"4469520","4475220"," They'll be like the police would just come into the neighborhoods and they would find like a house"
"4475220","4478500"," taken over, like just taken over."
"4478500","4480100"," Like big drug dealing house, right?"
"4480280","4483200"," It's not like you go up the house and knock on the door and you get sold drugs. "
"4483460","4489140"," They'd be like 20, 30 guys and they're like, they come trap houses now, but it was like, it was"
"4489140","4491600"," like a fort like drug for X or something."
"4492540","4494820"," And so the police would just come and burn them out."
"4495000","4496880"," They would just come and literally burn the house to the ground. "
"4502350","4505870"," I would have loved to have been here at that time buying properties."
"4506470","4508550"," Believe it or not, some of these mansions you see in Detroit."
"4510330","4516110"," When you look at the brickwork that there's a an immigrant class that moved to Detroit, I want to"
"4516110","4521930"," say turn of the century when Ford was just coming into existence to work in factories. "
"4522870","4527230"," They had this place called the aviation district or aviation sub."
"4527230","4534870"," It's called sub the aviation subdivision is like a Ford bike built like airports or like runways in"
"4534870","4536150"," the middle of Detroit at one time."
"4536350","4545450"," And you can see how Detroit was built up and all these immigrants that came to Detroit brought with"
"4545450","4550730"," them like first US generation construction skills. "
"4550730","4559390"," And they built insane houses here, insane mansions, beautiful, like wide avenues streets because of"
"4559390","4559910"," the car culture."
"4560710","4566150"," They had big big large causeways and then big huge lawns and then big huge backyards."
"4567510","4570450"," And so some of the architecture is just just mind blowing. "
"4570970","4575610"," It's like old school Boston architecture, old school, New York architecture."
"4582120","4583080"," Yeah, I agree with that."
"4584020","4586140"," I told the wife she moved there six days ago. "
"4587080","4588020"," It's not easy here."
"4588180","4589180"," I'll be honest with you."
"4589260","4589540"," It's not. "
"4591960","4592780"," It's not easier."
"4592920","4593580"," We've had to adjust."
"4594000","4596200"," So we looked at it like a, like we were sailing. "
"4597700","4598380"," They have great."
"4598500","4599620"," They have day schools here."
"4599780","4600060"," They're expensive. "
"4600060","4608380"," So they've got like day schools that will cost you anywhere from 30 to 60,000 a year for children"
"4608380","4610040"," that are under eighth grade."
"4610860","4617380"," They have a, if you, if you're more like a Waldorf kind of a person, they have a Waldorf school"
"4617380","4617660"," here."
"4618780","4622260"," But other than that, we have to, we homeschool. "
"4622540","4623780"," We homeschool with live teachers."
"4623780","4628280"," Just like we were in the mill, if we were in the military overseas and not in an American school"
"4628280","4631140"," with kids or if we were sailing around the world."
"4632380","4634180"," That's the kind of schooling we do for our kids. "
"4637540","4638680"," So there are some challenges."
"4640620","4642800"," There are even still today, there are some challenges."
"4651290","4652730"," Yeah, they're escrow screws them. "
"4653650","4654730"," One minute remaining."
"4656170","4659670"," Are you talking about the city of Detroit or Dan Gilbert himself?"
"4664690","4671590"," The Ukraine would have been turned to dust if the US has a fascinating comment to Andre saying, you"
"4671590","4674230"," know, I was talking to Joe yesterday about you."
"4674230","4678610"," Ukraine and how they're, they're kind of like the warrior class. "
"4679430","4681830"," Do you guys, you guys all know the history of Ukraine and Russia?"
"4682150","4687910"," Like Ukraine's most of the USSR's military came from Ukraine."
"4689570","4693990"," They have a long, long history of fighting for Russia specifically."
"4697590","4700270"," They held, they held all the nukes too. "
"4700690","4701930"," Most of the, most of Russian."
"4702590","4710730"," Ten second Russia or USSR's deployed nukes were in Ukraine and then the sailor or naval class of"
"4710730","4711730"," Russia came from Ukraine."
"4712570","4715130"," And of course, they're the second largest bread basket in the world. "
"4721650","4728490"," I think you'll say I'm talking with the volways about that, not Joe."
"4732570","4734550"," Yeah, I think that you'll see a ceasefire either."
"4734730","4738990"," I don't think you'll see any kind of ceasefire or truce of any kind. "
"4739130","4742310"," I don't think Ukraine does it unless there's real negotiations going on."
"4742310","4744090"," I don't think they're going to win up at all."
"4749430","4752510"," I think so vol is never talking about this. "
"4752730","4759610"," My point on Ukraine was that it's like a pickle, right?"
"4762150","4771990"," Ukraine gave up their nukes to be a buffer nation between NATO and Russia, which could have"
"4771990","4772890"," worked really well."
"4774450","4780430"," If anything, it could, like in East and West Berlin or East to East to West Germany, I should say"
"4780430","4783950"," Ukraine would have done well as that country."
"4786970","4791230"," But if you're Putin, it's not good enough, is it?"
"4791930","4794030"," It's like we have to have that country too. "
"4794190","4795190"," We want to have its wealth."
"4795550","4798690"," We want to have its ports."
"4798690","4803070"," We want to have the weekly EI-A natural gas storage report. "
"4804510","4814710"," It's got a very smart people, well-educated history of development, of nuclear arms, history"
"4814710","4819690"," of technological developments, all kinds of positiveness."
"4819690","4821390"," You say we're a buffer state."
"4822110","4827530"," Down 10% after the EI-A report, smaller than expected storage draws. "
"4828570","4837570"," Yes, and people related and say, well, it's kind of like if China took over Canada, what would the"
"4837570","4838050"," U.S. do?"
"4838230","4838970"," We'd invade, right?"
"4840710","4848370"," But if China didn't invade Canada, would we still invade our Canada, right?"
"4848670","4850650"," And cancer is more than likely not."
"4852950","4856350"," But Russia, of course, that's not good enough, right?"
"4856730","4857970"," So to me, that's a"
"4861200","4872180"," pickle."
"4875840","4878680"," So let's talk about our spreads real quick. "
"4879440","4885020"," So there's credit spreads and debit spreads."
"4885300","4893660"," Credit spreads, both credit and debit spreads will pay you with the passage of time."
"4895480","4900320"," Credit spreads will pay you faster with velocity and the movement of price. "
"4903040","4906580"," So large swings, you'll start to see a ramp in credit spreads."
"4906720","4912920"," Credit spreads are dangerous, though, to trade if one side of your trade becomes lopsided."
"4914100","4921220"," And that can be on a down move of your long call of credit spread. "
"4924580","4927820"," So the safest trade typically is debit spread."
"4929920","4931420"," Anyways, time is important."
"4931920","4937920"," So if you put, let's say a 380, 385 call debit spread that's three months out, you're going to make"
"4937920","4940180"," the majority of your money towards the end of that spread. "
"4942220","4945360"," You're looking more for, let's say, a move to 390."
"4946700","4953120"," You're looking for a directional move in that spread to like 390, 395, and then you just pull the"
"4953120","4953960"," plug and get out of them."
"4953960","4961760"," The other thing about spreads is if I spend a dollar, just as an example, I don't care what to"
"4961760","4969660"," put or call, I'm usually setting that spread for, for me personally, I'm only looking to hold it"
"4969660","4972880"," for about a 30% profit in my mind. "
"4972880","4978380"," So if I'm going to write a spread for a dollar, I'm going to write it for $3 or $4,"
"4979020","4982800"," and I'm going to try to get out when the spread is up a dollar."
"4983740","4984540"," Does that make sense?"
"4985860","4991000"," Now, that's because I don't want to actually keep the spread for the three months or the one month"
"4991000","4991700"," or the one week."
"4993060","4993560"," I don't care. "
"4993760","4994280"," Time doesn't matter."
"4994520","4997240"," I don't want to stay in that spread for that time period."
"4997920","5001240"," I don't want to hold it to the end for a bunch of other reasons. "
"5001820","5002980"," I'm not going to get into here."
"5004480","5010660"," So I'm looking for about 30% profit on whatever spread I took."
"5010700","5012480"," And then I close the, I exit the spread. "
"5013520","5017380"," I don't have any risk of assignment or not."
"5017560","5021180"," I don't have any risk of some more than likely not going to get assigned in the middle of that"
"5021180","5021460"," spread."
"5022760","5029660"," And I'm not trying to expose myself to risk for the, for the end of that spread as well. "
"5035100","5035840"," Argos are dead."
"5036120","5037600"," Have you been to those neighborhoods?"
"5038500","5041000"," I don't know what you're talking about, but I've been to every neighborhood in Detroit."
"5041400","5042060"," Every single one of them. "
"5043600","5045820"," I've been to the good neighborhoods, the bad neighborhoods."
"5049140","5050340"," Well, it was down."
"5050580","5051300"," So you guys are saying. "
"5055440","5056900"," I was a dead."
"5057040","5057920"," Have you been to those neighborhoods?"
"5058620","5059220"," Yes."
"5063060","5068460"," So the oil stocks are up due to they're not oil itself. "
"5069180","5071420"," They're the companies that do."
"5073480","5075140"," The infrastructure for oil."
"5075340","5075700"," Those are different. "
"5077980","5079260"," Yeah, there are parts of the trade."
"5079380","5081800"," I mean, like the east side of Detroit still shithole."
"5082340","5084020"," It just writes a weird place like. "
"5087260","5090920"," I always try to, there's this like river, let's say, right, right here."
"5092100","5098620"," Detroit is very much like Washington, D.C. Not exact, but there's the city center."
"5099340","5100720"," And there are neighborhoods here. "
"5101410","5105220"," There are more neighborhoods and more neighborhoods."
"5106620","5108040"," And more neighborhoods."
"5109600","5113380"," The rebuilding effort is in the city center moving outwards. "
"5118580","5121560"," And then because there's money out in the suburbs."
"5123580","5125960"," There's a push in from this side here."
"5130020","5137460"," So if you look like if you're looking for homes like in Northwest, Southwestern Detroit, they're"
"5137460","5138000"," very good. "
"5138300","5145600"," If you look for the center and the surrounding north end of Detroit, Mexican town, all this kind of"
"5145600","5146260"," stuff in here, it's great."
"5146960","5154640"," There's still like a native Detroit or band here in the middle that will likely always be working"
"5154640","5160160"," class and not where you want to live in here."
"5160640","5164880"," This is kind of like the no go, no go zone of Detroit. "
"5165680","5168420"," And parts of this include like the east side of Detroit up here."
"5169860","5174580"," And then a period have like East Point and gross point and all those kind of places."
"5174920","5179160"," You have telegraph is in here, Southfield Oak Park and then down below. "
"5179160","5187580"," I think this is Lavonia, Redford and oh shit, I forget the name of these places down here."
"5187780","5190060"," But so anything in here is outstanding."
"5190600","5191660"," Anything over here is outstanding. "
"5193220","5194420"," But this is just like any city."
"5194700","5197640"," If you go to any city, you'll see you go to like East LA."
"5197960","5198940"," There's East LA, right?"
"5199820","5201800"," There's Compton in California. "
"5203040","5206560"," Boston has its own places, right?"
"5206560","5213470"," Parts of Dorchester, parts of Mattapan, places like that."
"5219670","5220470"," Let me see."
"5221230","5222950"," The Cleveland tourism video is hilarious. "
"5224170","5230270"," As a matter of fact, there's Cleveland, Detroit Beach Cleveland in major crime this year, lower"
"5230270","5231790"," major crime this year."
"5232430","5232870"," I was pretty impressed."
"5238150","5240090"," I agree with the no way part. "
"5241690","5247350"," Dixie taking off again, peak day, think mass transit in Detroit flies 180 degrees to the car"
"5247350","5248050"," culture of Detroit."
"5249270","5249870"," Yeah."
"5252730","5256730"," No, so Detroit has built a."
"5258410","5261790"," Detroit ED is huge right now and it's becoming a."
"5262230","5264510"," You guys don't know about the trade I can tell. "
"5265590","5269170"," So like Google has expanded its presence in Detroit."
"5272710","5281590"," There are major car, major major trade electric vehicle companies have set up offices all over"
"5281590","5281890"," Detroit."
"5292120","5295160"," Yeah, you can I'm reading through some stuff right now on the news here. "
"5295260","5297120"," You guys need to be you guys need to get a."
"5298300","5299340"," You guys you guys."
"5299740","5300880"," ED is not moved to Canada."
"5309400","5310040"," Damn, Winky. "
"5314800","5316200"," Yeah, that is a neat place."
"5316740","5317520"," Santa Monica is the same way."
"5317860","5319840"," Do they still have rent control in Santa Monica?"
"5320940","5322140"," I wonder if they still do. "
"5327200","5338440"," Winky face is like what do you mean 3.6%. Yeah, Buffalo"
"5338440","5339180"," is like that too."
"5339280","5339840"," What's your edge?"
"5341440","5342680"," Yeah, drug for an X."
"5349890","5351410"," Put in that's 36 hours."
"5351550","5353390"," He's fired you to Orthodox Christmas celebration. "
"5354190","5357270"," Yeah."
"5361690","5364110"," Yeah."
"5375830","5376990"," Lee was he's saying. "
"5378750","5381950"," So private taxes are still low, which is the good thing about the trade."
"5382090","5384230"," If you go and buy a house that's worthless in Detroit."
"5387030","5390050"," The only real deals that I see right now are. "
"5390750","5394870"," The real deals that I see are still only at the county tax auction."
"5396310","5398890"," If you're going to buy in a real estate group or something."
"5399970","5401570"," The minimum buy in now is. "
"5404230","5406490"," Sometimes you'll see like 15 grand, but."
"5407530","5409210"," It's probably has major defects."
"5410270","5412750"," It's like the water lines cut. "
"5413950","5415070"," Foundation issues."
"5417470","5420550"," Area power lines kind of stuff from the power company."
"5421790","5423390"," Most of the deals in the trade are. "
"5423990","5425530"," They're not at the Detroit land bank."
"5425570","5426470"," Stay away from that shit."
"5427430","5429510"," Do not ever buy a land bank house. "
"5429910","5433030"," Best way to buy a house in the trade right now is to go to the county auction."
"5433370","5433930"," That's once a year."
"5434690","5436490"," You can still find houses for. "
"5437450","5439690"," Fifteen hundred to five thousand dollars."
"5444870","5446650"," And the taxes will still be low."
"5446750","5447810"," It's when you go to sell them. "
"5449110","5453570"," Once you sell them, the new owner is going to get hammered with taxes."
"5467580","5468540"," Good morning, Abraham."
"5468820","5469040"," How are you?"
"5474740","5475300"," Let's see. "
"5475380","5477240"," I can't study the exact addition of Ukraine."
"5477440","5478860"," It was always been a red line."
"5479740","5480800"," I missed that part. "
"5481140","5481760"," What you're saying, Willie?"
"5484580","5486420"," Yeah, I don't think nothing."
"5487120","5490980"," I don't think I know that from all everything I've read and watched about Ukraine and Russia, there"
"5490980","5491200"," was."
"5491980","5495100"," You got to understand Ukraine did was not going to join NATO. "
"5495600","5498940"," They had no plans to join NATO in any way, shape or form."
"5498940","5501000"," There's more of a pushing the of the issue."
"5501720","5503920"," In the US, what does the US want to do?"
"5504380","5506620"," They just want to kill Russians. "
"5507380","5512620"," So the US will make this war last as long as possible."
"5513940","5515000"," I was in the military."
"5515340","5521280"," If the longer we can make this war last or continue, the happier US military is. "
"5525700","5526180"," Yeah."
"5526880","5527260"," Yeah."
"5527260","5527340"," Yeah. "
"5531500","5534460"," So, you know, Willie spoke me saying the war would end today."
"5534600","5539320"," If Ukraine renounces application, the NATO application gives up fighting for Crimea and yield the"
"5539320","5540300"," Donbas territory."
"5540760","5541520"," Yeah, that won't happen though. "
"5543360","5544700"," They're not going to give up Crimea."
"5545020","5545920"," They're not going to give up Donbas."
"5548540","5551020"," As a matter of fact, that's how it was in the beginning. "
"5551300","5558000"," So initially, Russia did not have the Donbas or Crimea and they were not joining NATO."
"5559000","5561920"," But then, of course, the Russia creep stepped in, right?"
"5562180","5563300"," Take Donbas, take Crimea."
"5565440","5566420"," That's the pickle. "
"5566700","5568200"," That's the entire pickle right there."
"5572660","5575720"," Three years ago, America was fact-checking Ukraine for being in Nazi state."
"5576080","5578140"," Now America's best friends, clowns. "
"5579140","5579980"," Yeah, no."
"5581560","5583380"," This is that this is complete."
"5583840","5587400"," The US wants to just kill Russians. "
"5587400","5588380"," I'll be honest with you."
"5588500","5591240"," Whether you like that or not, that's what they want to do."
"5591640","5596200"," Any way that we can weaken China or Russia, we will at any given moment. "
"5607870","5610250"," Why isn't I always the east side of Cesar low income?"
"5615580","5617680"," They really ruined the market with zero-date options."
"5618060","5619020"," Dixie Bob may have just peaked."
"5620080","5623040"," Trade has some damn good pizza to fend off that buying cold in the winter. "
"5623040","5625940"," Yeah, I like their pizza, but I don't like it anymore."
"5627180","5628420"," It's too much for me."
"5629300","5634560"," But if you like a big meal, it's better than, I shouldn't say this, but it's better than Chicago"
"5634560","5634860"," pizza. "
"5636780","5638020"," I shouldn't say that though."
"5639760","5641540"," They still have rent control."
"5641760","5647680"," I used to live in Santa Monica and you'd see like a dirt core family living right next to a"
"5647680","5647920"," millionaire. "
"5649260","5650240"," It was always wild to see that."
"5654400","5655840"," Only grandfathered in now, Stacey."
"5656880","5662400"," Yeah, you have, from what I recall, when I lived in Santa Monica, it was a mix of people that"
"5662400","5665220"," were living in, or I'd lived in these homes for a very long time. "
"5668530","5673770"," And then like, you know, the, what do you call those people that, when you're, I guess I'm one of"
"5673770","5681290"," those people, but the hamster would come gentrifiers, sister gentrifiers move in."
"5685370","5686890"," Going all the way, I see you guys are saying here."
"5687150","5691850"," So cap regarding going for 30% on a spread for the challenge, going to do $1,000 or more. "
"5692010","5693850"," You're planning on going for 100% on each spread."
"5694370","5695050"," Yeah, so you go."
"5695950","5696770"," So if you're good. "
"5696930","5704330"," So what you do is you build your spread to spend a dollar for three or four dollars, right?"
"5704790","5707290"," But you only take a $2 out of that spread."
"5707450","5707950"," Does that make sense?"
"5708450","5709650"," That's still a hundred percent trade."
"5709650","5714970"," The trade is structured for 300%, but you're only taking a hundred percent out of the trade. "
"5715850","5716670"," Does that make sense?"
"5717530","5719510"," I don't know if that makes sense, but."
"5725940","5726640"," No, no, no."
"5726680","5728580"," So I think you're misinterpreting Chris. "
"5729500","5733700"," So Chris is saying, so I take it that the challenge is just for show and you don't go for"
"5733700","5736720"," a hundred percent in your trading accounts when you use the market breadth indicator."
"5737000","5741580"," No, no, no."
"5741580","5743640"," To bring you 100%. "
"5743640","5745020"," Let me rewrite it for you."
"5746100","5747040"," So here you go."
"5747460","5749280"," So I'm going to draw it simply for you. "
"5749600","5750220"," Here's a dollar."
"5751540","5751900"," Right."
"5752180","5760160"," If you were to take the $1 and take a spread, right, that only pays $2. "
"5760440","5762340"," Let's say your original dollar back over there."
"5764960","5770080"," Now that they will pays $1 means you're going to make a dollar on that dollar on that dollar risk."
"5771540","5772040"," Right. "
"5772120","5774320"," So let's say you paid you $2, right?"
"5774480","5776160"," That's a 100% trade."
"5776520","5777140"," Does that make sense?"
"5778920","5779420"," Right."
"5780360","5787040"," According to the SCEO, the U.S. can produce $13 million to $35 million barrels of oil per day"
"5787040","5789020"," before production plateaus. "
"5790020","5794900"," For say $3, right, but you're still getting paid your $2."
"5795340","5797340"," So it's still a 100% trade."
"5798100","5799440"," And it's always been like that. "
"5800240","5805200"," And that's because of the time that it takes for you in a spread to make that money."
"5805480","5809940"," So when you have a spread, if it's a one month, it's a one month spread, right?"
"5810880","5820860"," You'll typically make your first 30% to 50% in half the"
"5820860","5822400"," time of the age of the spread."
"5823260","5828940"," It typically won't make the other 50% of your spread until the end, the absolute end of your"
"5828940","5830960"," spread, the time of your spread. "
"5831680","5837100"," So if you structure it so that you only have to be exposed for this brief amount of time to"
"5837100","5840220"," get that same payout, does that make sense to you?"
"5840900","5846960"," I have my assumption is that you either don't know how spreads work or you don't understand the"
"5846960","5847820"," mechanics of a spread."
"5852870","5854770"," Maybe you don't understand the mechanics of a spread."
"5861510","5865310"," So you want to see a saying that's nice, I'm in a relatively rural state in the Mid-South, and"
"5865310","5868090"," I've nearly had a stroke from seeing property taxes as a first time home buyer. "
"5869230","5871490"," Yeah, property taxes right now are going to the roof."
"5872270","5873070"," They're ridiculous."
"5875830","5880170"," I pay a small fortune in property taxes. "
"5888440","5891460"," Why should they, hold on I'm missing stuff."
"5894740","5896220"," Why should they give up Crimea?"
"5896720","5901360"," You want to see some seriously jack taxes check up the Texas Hill Country for all the New Yorkers"
"5901360","5904640"," and California taters are moving."
"5904860","5905060"," Yeah. "
"5909560","5913360"," It's time to move down to Texas and I'm extremely thankful I've avoided the shit show of Dallas and"
"5913360","5913580"," Austin."
"5915480","5919560"," At 11 a.m. Eastern time we get EIA crude oil inventory."
"5920040","5922100"," The week and the raw car, it's 1.5 million. "
"5922600","5923720"," And the price is 40."
"5924600","5928000"," 718 million with a range of 4 million to minus 4 million."
"5928860","5934660"," Gasoline inventories, 4 cars minus 1 million on fire minus 3 spot 105 million. "
"5935280","5939720"," Distiller inventories, 4 cars minus 1 spot 173 million on fire."
"5940900","5947300"," And crude cushing inventories prior minus serious spot 195 million."
"5947800","5948800"," Yeah, hipster. "
"5949240","5954100"," I'm one of the bad guys and one of the hipster gentrifiers, right?"
"5954280","5955440"," That's what you'd probably call me."
"5961770","5962210"," Yeah."
"5962450","5962710"," Cinematic. "
"5962710","5963350"," We'll do that Stacy."
"5963770","5965090"," It's really crazy too."
"5965490","5970690"," You'll have like, I'm talking about like, talking about like, you're looking at buyouts. "
"5970790","5972590"," You're like, Oh, this house is appraised."
"5972590","5973570"," They're like two grand a year."
"5973710","5974170"," It's easy. "
"5974530","5975190"," 1,500 year."
"5975830","5981350"," And then you go and you buy it and you either remodel it and get reassessed or you buy it"
"5981350","5982150"," already remodeled."
"5982910","5984150"," And it's like hello, 12 grand. "
"5984410","5985290"," Hello, 15 grand."
"5987310","5989610"," Hopefully you're making that extra 15 K."
"5993230","5993830"," Yeah."
"5998270","5999750"," Purple Thomas hilarious. "
"6006810","6008010"," Yeah, 30%."
"6008010","6009930"," Yeah, no, I'm not taking."
"6010170","6012730"," I'm not taking 30% profit. "
"6013030","6013270"," I'm taking."
"6013710","6016130"," It's more how this how the spread is structured."
"6016130","6022050"," Like, it's just time and spread. "
"6022210","6029070"," The other part of this too is if you start trading spreads due to making most of your money in"
"6029070","6036190"," the time on the back end of the time decay of the spread, you could place two or three more"
"6036190","6040030"," spreads in that time period rather than be tied up in that spread."
"6044250","6049590"," And that's the same thing that Tony cheese was doing is so like Tony cheese is buying an in the"
"6049590","6050090"," money spread."
"6050730","6055170"," He's not going to get max gains unless we come. "
"6055670","6056170"," Matter of fact."
"6056490","6058330"," So if you were to buy this, this isn't something crazy."
"6058870","6060430"," We should, we should pay for trade this. "
"6061750","6062530"," Hold on here."
"6065370","6066770"," Just as an example."
"6067530","6068370"," Hold on here. "
"6068370","6070990"," You're going to be something really cool to look at a paper trade."
"6072030","6073090"," Just as a thought."
"6073330","6081070"," But if you guys want to do this really cool like a really good cool like really cool thought"
"6081070","6089050"," experiment would be if you want a really cool thought experiment. "
"6089050","6092990"," I mean, this probably isn't the best way to structure this trade, but you could."
"6096090","6098090"," You might get you might get."
"6101230","6103530"," You could catch an assignment on this trade. "
"6104670","6110070"," But as if you didn't catch an assignment on this trade, it would be super cool to."
"6112010","6113590"," It would be super cool to."
"6114070","6114530"," I don't know. "
"6114630","6116190"," You might catch an assignment on this trade."
"6116850","6122250"," There's some mechanical problems with this trade because if you took like a call spread."
"6122250","6125450"," That expired right in here. "
"6126550","6127270"," In March."
"6130120","6132900"," We just took a you wouldn't want to do a call spread."
"6132900","6134540"," You probably want to do a super wide butterfly. "
"6135680","6137260"," But this is a thought experiment."
"6138540","6142600"," You could see like you could actually buy a call spread here and have a plunge."
"6143320","6146760"," And then come back up and it would still print over time. "
"6148560","6151520"," Theoretically you wouldn't want to place that trade, but."
"6152840","6159160"," Theoretically you could you could get that spread to print by the time you could have like a plunge"
"6159160","6163600"," in here and come straight back up and you'd be in the money with the time."
"6165420","6167840"," With like the time decay and that spread. "
"6168420","6169580"," And so that was my point."
"6169860","6173840"," Like if you did a call spread here, I probably do something that's like."
"6174260","6175540"," So this is SPX. "
"6176000","6178300"," You wanted a call spread you probably be thinking about."
"6179500","6180620"," Something that's in the money."
"6181500","6184240"," That ends by the end of your season. "
"6185660","6186140"," Right."
"6186800","6187880"," So you do like a call spread."
"6188600","6193060"," If you're bullish feeling bullish bias for the run up into your. "
"6193560","6196260"," You just be hoping for this kind of a move right here."
"6196600","6197080"," Does it make sense."
"6198380","6202260"," And then you wouldn't have that call spread this far out because of the risk. "
"6202720","6204040"," Of a down move right."
"6204040","6206000"," There even a pen here."
"6207460","6210760"," And if you're getting bearish. "
"6211780","6213140"," You could buy a put spread."
"6213420","6216280"," If I thought about put spread today, I'd be buying it for the."
"6216840","6219580"," With an expiration sometime in this. "
"6219820","6221360"," 11 a.m. Eastern time."
"6221520","6227240"," We get EIA crude oil in real toys forecast one spot five million on the prior zero spot seven one"

"6243500","6249560"," And crucially inventories prior minus zero spot one nine five million trying to show you guys."
"6249560","6251180"," I thought I thought I was clacking."

"6262900","6264720"," Short thirty sixty."
"6265160","6267180"," You've got long magnet right here."
"6267760","6269380"," And you've got short right here. "
"6271800","6272660"," I'm over here."
"6276640","6279680"," All of our snap and lines trying to give you guys a visualization."
"6279680","6281100"," I'm not getting it to the actual. "
"6285980","6286980"," To the actual."
"6288900","6289860"," Time frame."
"6290720","6291360"," Okay. "
"6294740","6303200"," So if you want to get."
"6303200","6304940"," Mid February somewhere in here."
"6305340","6306720"," So you get an in the money call spread. "
"6307620","6308940"," Like a mid February."
"6312440","6313340"," Date on it."
"6314300","6318380"," Somewhere around three eighty five three eighty but you'd want it to you'd want the call spread to"
"6318380","6319340"," end somewhere in here. "
"6320760","6324740"," If you're if you're a bear wanting to buy a put spread."
"6325400","6329080"," He wants that put spread to be somewhere in the middle of March like."
"6329680","6332260"," You even call like March 17 somewhere in here. "
"6332260","6334160"," So we even move this over here."
"6337040","6338000"," To like March."
"6341670","6342710"," Seventeenth right there. "
"6347280","6348760"," This would be the best way to do it."
"6349940","6351540"," I clean all this up for you."
"6352880","6354960"," Had this on Friday and then. "
"6355500","6356720"," I don't know if I deleted it."
"6357360","6359680"," Or if I guess something like that."
"6361160","6362880"," Would be what you'd be looking for. "
"6365730","6370910"," See your thesis should be one of two that we're going to at least melt up and you're hoping for"
"6370910","6373370"," some kind of buying actually what you've seen in XLF."
"6374650","6379230"," And then you're going to see probably at some point in my view what I think you're going to see"
"6379230","6379430"," is."
"6380010","6383350"," You're going to see some kind of a melt up and then you're going to see people. "
"6383510","6384110"," You're going to see companies."
"6385210","6389110"," Be like, ah, you know, are being sucked and you're going to see this."
"6389250","6390170"," Believe it or not. "
"6391510","6392770"," Come crashing down."
"6392910","6393690"," I think you're going to see that."
"6394610","6396770"," I think something somewhere down in here. "
"6397430","6400470"," And then you probably see that that whiplash effect up into."
"6403030","6405130"," Into the pen pins right up in here."
"6408510","6410350"," You could have the other. "
"6411210","6412270"," You could have the other."
"6413330","6415310"," You have the bullish standpoint that we're going to."
"6416670","6418150"," I guess this would be the bullish. "
"6418710","6420170"," Or not the boss, but the bearish."
"6421250","6422190"," Let me see here."
"6425260","6426420"," Where is the. "
"6429420","6430080"," Where's that?"
"6434040","6435300"," You have the bearish."
"6435600","6436640"," This would be the bearish."
"6445830","6446770"," Did it right?"
"6449690","6451390"," It's the bearish case right here. "
"6453910","6454790"," One minute remaining."
"6455310","6457750"," I'll lead with EIA crude oil inventories."
"6458290","6459830"," Or I guess if you're like Super Bowl. "
"6460670","6463390"," If you're anyone's out there super bullish."
"6464710","6465210"," You would."
"6466310","6467170"," What do you think's going to happen?"
"6467270","6468810"," You think we're going to come down here to the pen. "
"6470110","6471290"," Maybe wait for."
"6472210","6473770"," We never quite get down there."
"6476970","6478790"," Do you wait until this is over?"
"6482370","6484050"," If you were super bullish then. "
"6484590","6486930"," My assumption would be you'd have to wait until this."
"6487090","6488350"," This hedge comes off the market."
"6492560","6493380"," Some like that. "
"6493580","6494540"," I don't believe in this at all."
"6495240","6496560"," Yeah, I'm just going to delete that."
"6496760","6498740"," But you probably get pinned in here sideways. "
"6500460","6503060"," Once the hedge comes off the market, we'd be free to go higher."
"6503840","6506620"," Either one of these."
"6508060","6511620"," I think my I'm still on this trade right here. "
"6513080","6515160"," But if you're a bear, it doesn't really matter, right?"
"6515280","6517940"," That's why you're seeing selling into strength is that bears."
"6517940","6519720"," One spot six nine four million."
"6519960","6522140"," Six nine four million for this. "
"6522180","6525120"," Build on the forecast of one spot five million."
"6526420","6527460"," You guys want to get started?"
"6528120","6530160"," Minus zero spot three four six million."
"6530160","6532340"," Minus zero spot three four six million. "
"6532440","6535120"," A build on the forecast of minus one million."
"6535120","6541440"," Is still inventories minus one spot four to seven million minus one spot four to seven million."
"6541720","6545620"," A drawer on the forecast of minus one spot one seven three million. "
"6546200","6550960"," Crude Cushing inventories at zero spot two four four million zero spot two four four million."
"6551420","6552760"," So what I'll do is."
"6553400","6554500"," This is what I'm going to do. "
"6556740","6558160"," This is SPX, right?"
"6561670","6563150"," You guys take a snapshot of that."
"6568100","6571940"," You guys take your own snapshot of that like you as a snipper tool."
"6573160","6575260"," And you take a snapshot of that right there. "
"6575820","6579220"," And what I'll do is I won't delete this."
"6579500","6581560"," I'll leave this SPX as it is."
"6582240","6584060"," And we'll see if we trade this. "
"6585200","6587160"," And I'll even write on here."
"6588280","6593460"," U.S. to sell fifty seven billion dollars in three month bills on January 9th to settle on January"

"6599720","6601140"," That's on January the 12th. "
"6601260","6602980"," The yellow path yellow line."
"6604400","6605140"," Is path."
"6609500","6610960"," We'll see how this plays out. "
"6611040","6612400"," I'll leave this up here or you guys."
"6612520","6617160"," The U.S. screens sell forty billion dollars in three year notes on January the 10th to settle on"
"6617160","6618580"," January the 17th."
"6618580","6619860"," You guys take a screenshot of this. "
"6621640","6626220"," And you show me I think yellow line is path some kind of failure above here."
"6627160","6628600"," And I think it's probably."
"6629560","6630740"," This is January. "
"6631840","6632840"," This mid February."
"6634600","6635480"," Somewhere in here."
"6635840","6642320"," Oil prices extend gains after EIA data shows larger than expected build in U.S. crude inventories. "
"6642780","6643480"," That's what I think."
"6643660","6645040"," That's what I think something like that."
"6646640","6647660"," So take a snapshot. "
"6650540","6653180"," And let's see how close the path we are."
"6655180","6660460"," Personally, I don't care if we like, you know, come down here and then up here and then down there"
"6660460","6661340"," and then down there."
"6661800","6662660"," I kind of nonsense. "
"6666300","6667460"," But you like this."
"6667620","6669620"," This is what I think path is the yellow line right there."
"6669760","6671060"," So you take a little snip of that. "
"6671660","6673440"," And we'll see how this plays out into."
"6675620","6681340"," EIA inventories of crude in the U.S. and the petroleum reserve of two spot seven million barrels to"
"6681340","6684340"," three hundred and 72 spot three eight million."

"6710470","6711110"," Stacey. "
"6712690","6719910"," They're the one thing that I see in real estate groups here is that their majority of them."
"6720150","6723590"," Majority of them don't live in Detroit, like so specifically to Detroit."

"6733110","6736630"," You'll see people from out of state."
"6736630","6739970"," Yeah, that's the EIA weekly inventories for those interested. "
"6741970","6746330"," I saw I was seeing a lot of out of state landlords are out of country landlords."
"6748070","6751490"," They were moving into these cities and buying up properties."
"6751730","6753630"," They might hold like 30 to 50 properties. "
"6754290","6758390"," And then they started to really increase to a hundred three hundred properties."
"6758390","6760970"," The past three or four months."
"6763010","6765790"," Or I shouldn't say that six months ago. "
"6766950","6768670"," The market kind of died."
"6769910","6772770"," And then three months ago, one to three months ago."
"6773670","6780130"," We started seeing unseen buyers without everyone seems to or my group seems to think that. "
"6780610","6782030"," They're corporate entities."
"6783630","6791470"," You were seeing small, not small, but like I own 50 properties and I'm from California."
"6792390","6794390"," And I'm trying to dump some of these properties. "
"6795570","6795890"," No buyers."
"6797230","6801390"," And then out of the blue, like one to three months ago, inside this real estate group that I'm in,"
"6801810","6803030"," someone would post the property."
"6803210","6803770"," I just want to get out. "
"6803770","6809170"," 30 grand, 50 grand occupied cash deal."
"6811210","6813090"," And boom, they'd be brought up."
"6813510","6816070"," It wasn't being brought by those mid level. "
"6820730","6825130"," Mid, mid, mid level real estate investors."
"6826030","6828490"," I think it was corporate America where it was buying the stuff."
"6830090","6831930"," And I live here with my kids. "
"6832170","6834990"," So I'm like, eh, I'm like, don't group me."
"6834990","6835530"," And with those people."
"6837190","6838330"," I'm invested in Detroit. "
"6838910","6839810"," I'm a part of the community."
"6840070","6840710"," I pay my taxes."
"6841670","6842210"," I live here. "
"6843370","6844830"," I only hire people from Detroit."
"6845790","6847210"," But the corporate landlords are brutal."
"6849070","6851750"," And the out of state and out of country landlords are bad too. "
"6852410","6852850"," In my view."
"6860300","6863960"," If you don't mind me asking you, depending on how much work do you think work should cost to get"
"6863960","6865440"," a property and move in right into Detroit."
"6865440","6867200"," I always recommend. "
"6869460","6871640"," So this happens every generation."
"6872280","6875160"," You know, when you're, you have to understand that."
"6876540","6885200"," Or not have to, but so my father moved to Boston when it was a war zone, basically. "
"6886680","6890000"," And other people moved Boston when it was a war zone."
"6891500","6893020"," And they created a community."
"6893020","6894460"," So they bought houses. "
"6895600","6898100"," They had to work on these houses."
"6898100","6902660"," Then they had to put the kids in school and they had to get involved in school and they built"
"6902660","6903560"," small businesses."

"6926660","6927940"," It's always better to move there."
"6929340","6931180"," And then the costs are lower. "
"6935100","6940240"," If I was, if I was, if I was younger again, once again, I would have moved here without being"
"6940240","6940620"," married."
"6940620","6941920"," I would have probably moved alone."
"6943160","6947000"," I bought a house and I would have parked like an RV in the backyard or something. "
"6947000","6950700"," And I would have just started renovating it myself."
"6952080","6957500"," I would make friends with my neighbors and try to find some other guys in the neighborhood and say,"
"6957780","6958860"," that's what I do when I moved here."
"6959480","6960180"," I met a guy. "

"6964240","6965680"," You want to help me and I'll help you."

"6974560","6976160"," Well, you guys got YouTube today. "
"6976600","6978560"," You guys go right on YouTube and learn how to do anything."
"6979280","6980020"," It's kind of cool."
"6980220","6980880"," So how much the cost?"
"6983060","6988740"," I would find someone that you could meet that lives in Detroit that could tell you best places to"
"6988740","6989380"," buy a house. "
"6990120","6994260"," Then I would set aside a budget for buying maybe $5,000."
"6995680","6999540"," I would wait for the Wayne County tax auction."
"7000380","7007180"," And then I would have someone in Detroit look at maybe 30 to 40 addresses. "
"7007780","7008920"," Just drive those neighborhoods."
"7010380","7015540"," Then you would have a list down to however many houses are in that 30 or 50 houses you're looking"
"7015540","7015860"," for."
"7016440","7020100"," You start to bid on the house you want in the auction. "
"7020520","7020880"," Do you win it?"
"7023060","7026160"," Then I would say buy yourself an RV."
"7028820","7030680"," So you have $5,000 to buy a house."
"7033660","7034680"," And then I'd get an RV. "
"7035980","7036640"," Shipbox RV."
"7036860","7039500"," I'd pack all your shit up and move to Detroit or some other city like it."
"7039720","7040800"," I'd pull it right in the backyard. "
"7042980","7048760"," And then I would be hitting up any sales that you see at the big box stores."
"7049120","7051560"," I'd be doing the demo work to start."
"7054160","7056780"," Buy yourself a dump trailer of some kind. "
"7057140","7061900"," The little beat up dump trailer and start demo in that house."
"7062360","7065120"," Get yourself a Tyvek suit with some filters and some gloves."
"7065900","7067160"," Some demo tools. "

"7091300","7094440"," Start doing the demo work and have a livable space in that home."
"7095120","7097200"," Small livable space by the following winter."
"7099360","7101680"," Then you get basic utilities up and running. "
"7101680","7103900"," If you had a job."
"7105420","7108120"," You could probably if you make 50,000 here."
"7108360","7110460"," 50,000 to 75,000 a year. "

"7203680","7208060"," community or all the things that come along with that."
"7212660","7216780"," The only other thing that came to trade with specifically was an open mind."
"7217180","7225540"," I dodged a lot of landmines by not trying to have the ideas but work with people here who have"
"7225540","7229520"," their own ideas, people from here who have their own ideas and treat people like they're normal"
"7229520","7230060"," human beings. "

"7243980","7245240"," You mind me being your neighbor?"
"7245420","7247120"," You want to come over and break bread with me?"
"7247580","7248420"," That kind of stuff."
"7249220","7250720"," That is very critical too. "
"7252480","7260800"," You have to be open-minded to new experiences and you'll find people come out of the woodwork."
"7261120","7265360"," You move into a tough place or a tough community and you're like, this looks bad."
"7265360","7269580"," Then you find out that the whole entire street wants the same thing that you want. "
"7272840","7273800"," How much money do you need?"
"7273960","7274200"," I don't know."
"7275320","7282000"," Maybe to start maybe like 10 grand, 5 grand to buy, 5 grand to move here and then get yourself"
"7282000","7282300"," a job."
"7282480","7283680"," They've got crazy jobs here in Detroit. "
"7285800","7286940"," Here's another crazy one."
"7290400","7291820"," Here's another one crazy one for you."
"7291820","7294080"," They're incentivizing people to move here. "
"7295360","7298040"," Let's say you don't have a college education."
"7298520","7301200"," I just saw a program that they launched where they'll pay you."
"7302620","7304200"," Double bottom on the spy right now. "
"7305100","7308940"," They'll pay you to go to school."
"7309900","7315620"," One of these programs I just launched was they'll send you to school to be a welder."
"7315620","7319320"," I'm like, man, well, there's some welders after like 10, 15 years. "
"7319460","7322300"," We're making three figures easily."
"7323380","7327760"," It's not a trade that you're going to get hurt in."
"7328300","7329800"," Mostly you're not going to get hurt in it. "
"7330320","7333400"," If you join a union or something, you'll make six figures."
"7335760","7338180"," The trade Michigan does as well."
"7338460","7341740"," The University of Michigan will pay for a full ride to college. "
"7342560","7347260"," If you excel in school, the kids excel at school, you'll get a free ride."
"7348140","7351320"," It's like a top 100 university in the U.S. It's well regarded."
"7352880","7356240"," You know, where you might be paying too much in some other place. "
"7356420","7358400"," You might be living now that suburban community."
"7359520","7361740"," That's already, you know, people have already made their money."
"7363900","7366800"," If you look at the opportunity, it's probably in a place like Detroit. "
"7375050","7375410"," Yeah."
"7377170","7379730"," Got about 400 acres or for 5K in the 70s."
"7379830","7379970"," Damn. "
"7383650","7384570"," Leaving the kids."
"7388010","7388370"," Yeah."
"7388470","7389770"," Trade's like welding while I was print man. "
"7397050","7397410"," Yeah."
"7397550","7398070"," I agree with that too."
"7399290","7404030"," I'm thinking about more like, if you're going to be, if you're going to learn a trade, it's"
"7404030","7409350"," probably like maybe an electrician doesn't get as damaged as well. "
"7409510","7415610"," You know, you want to be picking a trade like I'm a drywaller or I'm working in concrete or more."
"7415830","7416930"," I guess concrete can be good."
"7417630","7419150"," If you have an education, it can be. "
"7419290","7422410"," But if you're like a laborer, those trades will kill you."
"7422950","7426110"," I haven't seen any framers that do well later in life."
"7428470","7432570"," Not they don't, but it must get into the management side of things I've never seen. "
"7432770","7434050"," Those guys all get real beat up."
"7443420","7444520"," Oh, no shit, John."
"7445600","7446460"," Red on brother. "
"7450680","7452260"," Some of the sales people are willing to really help."
"7452480","7453880"," Tumbleweed best land is that affordable now?"
"7454280","7454340"," Yeah."
"7455480","7456900"," Yeah, I just saw a Fledge garage. "
"7456900","7459360"," I just saw some guy started a YouTube channel."
"7461040","7462820"," I was going to find this guy."
"7463760","7466160"," This guy is like trying to build forests in Texas. "
"7468360","7473920"," Some guys building forests in Texas is buying like 300 acre parcels or something."
"7474480","7476100"," He just started a YouTube channel."
"7476860","7478420"," So I went down the rabbit hole on that shit. "
"7480320","7481440"," South Reno rules."
"7482500","7482840"," I love Reno."
"7485900","7487320"," You want to be a burner move to Reno?"
"7488460","7489300"," Yeah, I'm a burner. "

"7506500","7507640"," Tons of music here. "
"7508060","7508920"," Music is unreal."
"7524330","7525550"," Yeah, 17, Jan."
"7526230","7528670"," 3, 3, 3, 1 spy entry. "
"7531790","7532270"," Yeah."
"7536510","7538890"," Yeah, so they've got a they have a zombie."
"7541890","7543770"," Yeah, so that's that's the thing too. "
"7543770","7544510"," You should always be."
"7544730","7546190"," There's a couple of cool things you can do."
"7546750","7547090"," They have. "
"7547170","7550390"," So each paying charge is talking about a zombie property program too."
"7550830","7553510"," So you can buy commercial buildings here through a zombie property program."
"7553510","7554390"," The city owns. "
"7555050","7556150"," And there's another cool one too."
"7556310","7558510"," There's a even where you wherever you live."
"7559070","7561410"," If you live somewhere other than Detroit, even a nice place. "
"7562210","7565410"," They have these some places have courthouse step auctions."
"7566870","7570970"," Where they auction properties off the courthouse steps for your community."
"7570970","7575070"," You can sometimes get steals on homes like steals. "
"7577330","7577850"," Stills."
"7581220","7582600"," Who's asking about section eight?"
"7583340","7585640"," At some point, this may make certain options."
"7585920","7586680"," We can get ugly. "
"7590620","7592260"," Yeah, I'm not a."
"7596580","7600580"," And they went to a Putin shooting at some dudes and up from the ground."
"7600580","7601460"," They came above one."
"7607100","7615880"," Yeah, there should be a rally up. "
"7617380","7619520"," We should we should rally into."
"7621920","7622900"," We should route."
"7623100","7624120"," We should be rallying here. "
"7625060","7625960"," That's my view."
"7627440","7629140"," It probably is like a."
"7632660","7635340"," They probably is a point of no return."
"7637680","7639120"," We look at the one month here. "
"7642460","7645140"," And it probably is a point of no return where."
"7646560","7648560"," Where it really starts bloodbath in."
"7659060","7661040"," Like when do we when do we break trend. "
"7662240","7663940"," It's kind of kind of hard to say."
"7667900","7668820"," Hold on."
"7670200","7671560"," Oh, Scott wonky here. "
"7673260","7674620"," We mean we had a low."
"7676100","7677320"," Here we had a low here."
"7678600","7681440"," Do you consider three sixty four breaking trend?"
"7681700","7682000"," I don't know. "
"7687030","7687730"," There's one."
"7687930","7688390"," Here's two."
"7688870","7690330"," I guess you'd have to consider. "
"7691550","7694270"," The break of this area down here to be a break of trend."
"7694430","7695950"," You'd still in trend, which crazy."
"7696030","7697030"," You'd still be in trend. "
"7698270","7700910"," As low as three sixty four down here."
"7703530","7705090"," Believe it or not, that's still trend."
"7705730","7706150"," That wild. "
"7707710","7709990"," You can see the low here and here."
"7710270","7711710"," So you'd still be in trend."
"7712990","7715790"," As low as like three sixty four three seventy two. "
"7716310","7719270"," We have a gap down here that still hasn't been filled either."
"7721930","7723370"," You see it down below here."
"7726110","7727990"," This gap wasn't filled yesterday. "
"7730090","7732310"," We started to fill it two days ago."
"7732310","7736730"," There's no gap filled yet down below here on S2."
"7737990","7742430"," I mean, where does that counter trend rally start?"
"7743950","7747970"," You know, you could do all this right here and it wouldn't matter. "
"7751030","7752310"," Price doesn't matter."
"7752750","7754310"," Let's look at a weekly chart."
"7759530","7764860"," And you know, you kind of still see this green line right here. "
"7764900","7767720"," This is the one eighty six, but two hundred is."
"7769260","7770700"," Right down here too."
"7770920","7771260"," So. "
"7773660","7778260"," You need to break that two hundred for the for IWM for the rut to."
"7778740","7782380"," If the rut showing you that we're going to crash or something."
"7783620","7786120"," You'd still want to see that break of this weekly movement. "
"7786120","7787100"," You're still moving average down here."
"7789040","7794200"," And you can even just see this white line is you're still in trend, believe it or not."
"7795540","7804440"," That sounds bizarre, but you're still except your bear"
"7804440","7807680"," still in trend, even here to come down here. "
"7807800","7811560"," The weekly moving average is somewhere like right here."
"7812760","7817840"," So you could trade down here and still be in trend into the 20th."
"7819620","7820440"," Does it make sense?"
"7821420","7822260"," Crazy, right?"
"7825640","7828000"," You could still be in this uptrend. "
"7843280","7844800"," And I'd love to see that get closed."
"7845360","7847600"," If we could get that if we get this closed right here."
"7850140","7852480"," If you get any of this closed in here. "
"7853220","7854520"," Then you just gap down here."
"7854620","7858420"," We've been trying to close this gap down here for what two weeks?"
"7858700","7859340"," Three weeks, right?"
"7859600","7860720"," We talked about closing this gap."
"7863550","7865530"," We can get any of this gap closed down here. "
"7869590","7873390"," Or it's not those are one, two, three, four, five."
"7873630","7874350"," So the gaps, Lawrence."
"7875590","7877130"," Maybe it's that three seventy three. "
"7877670","7879650"," I mean, we finally did close it back here."
"7880250","7881230"," So I guess I'm wrong on that."
"7882930","7884550"," This is the gap that we haven't closed. "
"7885050","7886610"," We did get a close in that gap below."
"7888450","7890490"," So now we just have this one new gap right here."
"7895340","7896620"," So we'll keep our eyes on us too. "
"7906620","7908000"," I thought that gap was still open."
"7908740","7912040"," The one that was at three seventy three down here."
"7912640","7915620"," That gap was still still still open, but they did close it. "
"7928400","7929480"," Dude, dead day."
"7930560","7932240"," I haven't taken a single trade today."
"7932340","7932520"," Nothing. "
"7933680","7934560"," Look at that."
"7935100","7941390"," Look at that dog shit."
"7942470","7943750"," Nothing all day long. "
"7947780","7949940"," There's the gap is."
"7950940","7951700"," Hold on."
"7953720","7955120"," The gap is right here. "
"7968060","7969560"," I don't know if I can make it transparent."
"7971540","7973080"," We'll leave that here though and look for it."
"7997930","7999710"," Here's a gap right here. "
"8000330","8002870"," Here's where the gap is."
"8004790","8014630"," You can see you view ops start to start to scream"
"8014630","8015250"," higher here."
"8045350","8046190"," Nice. "
"8046830","8053150"," So the Ukraine presidential advisor Russian forces must leave the occupied territories."
"8053920","8056390"," Only then will have a temporary truce."
"8061860","8064810"," Not unexpected to hear Ukraine say that. "
"8079910","8081870"," I'm going to try to buy some calls down here."
"8087890","8090530"," I might want to get a call spread down here."
"8090530","8092770"," I'm going to look at a call spread right now in the background. "
"8127550","8134470"," Don't squeeze up"
"8134470","8142670"," yet."
"8142670","8149150"," One month."
"8150470","8158490"," It's like February"
"8158490","8164670"," 24th. "
"8164670","8165610"," I"
"8165610","8180890"," just"
"8180890","8190690"," want to look at the month again."
"8193830","8195389"," There's a gap above here."
"8196230","8197570"," There's a small gap above here. "
"8197570","8201530"," You can see it right there."
"8204910","8206410"," Set small gap right there."
"8208930","8210629"," There's a gap right here. "
"8225750","8234129"," There's a gap"
"8234129","8240610"," right here."
"8253049","8254830"," It doesn't pay that well."
"8256450","8261090"," UK foreign minister cleverly says we are moving pretty fast when resolving the Northern Ireland"
"8261090","8261410"," protocol. "
"8263350","8266690"," There's a 224 minute remaining."
"8267330","8270430"," I'll lead with the bid to cover ratio for the four week bills."
"8276080","8278809"," 224 right there. "
"8283219","8284520"," That's kind of what I'm looking at right now."
"8285980","8290799"," So if we went down and came back up, they would only need to print any of this area here."
"8307580","8309600"," It's not that much money though. "
"8309740","8319280"," It's a 675 risk 675 make 5.2. It doesn't print that great."
"8322500","8324020"," Let me see if I can adjust it."
"8324020","8328480"," 377. "
"8335160","8336840"," Slightly better."
"8339139","8341920"," This one is 377."
"8347620","8349059"," Right here is money. "
"8354580","8357100"," 377.386 is 490."
"8358160","8358600"," You make 410."
"8360160","8361840"," 48% chance of profitability. "
"8365260","8366940"," If you're to go 380."
"8374340","8375600"," It's getting better."
"8381600","8386420"," 386 call spread is what risk 315 for 285. "
"8388460","8390640"," It's much riskier though."
"8392140","8396600"," It's much riskier."
"8397180","8397740"," 387. "
"8400440","8402340"," That's a pretty fucking sweet deal though."
"8409340","8413660"," You need to be, what is that, 380?"
"8415260","8417300"," That's not that good of a deal."
"8420060","8420740"," 229. "
"8422580","8429340"," 4-week high yield, 4-spot 1%, 4-spot 1%, 3-to-6."
"8430060","8436560"," US sells $46 billion in 4-week bills, awards 30-spot 47% of bids at high."
"8445820","8449120"," I'm trying to think if we had a bloodbath to come back up and at least tag up here. "
"8459660","8466120"," We've hit a bloodbath, this is what we saw right here."
"8483060","8484680"," This isn't even that bad."
"8484680","8492420"," If you were to take a 371-380 call for the 24th, you could do a 371"
"8494370","8500550"," and a 380 call spread. "
"8506930","8514750"," You're selling one and you're buying one, but the idea would be that you would cut the one side of"
"8514750","8516830"," that trade loose if we ever go up here."
"8516830","8521590"," If we start going like this, cut one side of the trade loose, you'd have to manage this trade."
"8522230","8531250"," The cool part is that it's 556 to make 344. "
"8539210","8543050"," It's a winner as long as you're 24th, you're at 371."
"8543050","8545390"," If you had a bloodbath, it would still print."
"8546410","8552530"," If you had a death-divine bloodbath down here, you would still print that trade. "
"8554650","8557330"," You'd have to manage it though."
"8574580","8579500"," You'd have to select it."
"8592360","8597180"," You'd buy a 371 call, 371C. "
"8599540","8602420"," So a 380C."
"8606860","8614640"," Close the 380C if we start"
"8614640","8619180"," ramping."
"8623380","8632460"," Above, probably above 385 or so, something like that. "
"8636560","8645020"," You'd have to cut one side loose, and that would print"
"8645020","8647240"," not great money."
"8648620","8650400"," If you manage it, it would print a piece"
"8650400","8662440"," of"
"8662440","8662440"," money."
"8666700","8676560"," Hold on a second, I'll show it to"
"8676560","8677000"," you. "
"8683020","8685440"," There's the trade right there."
"8685440","8687420"," Risk 556, make 344."
"8688140","8692420"," You make a 556 back, I don't know if you know that, but you make 556, and then you actually"
"8692420","8694300"," make an extra 344 on top of it. "
"8696100","8699660"," If you look for time, this is January 5th."
"8700940","8710920"," Your max losses are below 371.10, but if you swing high at any"
"8710920","8718180"," point between now and February 24th, you'd make $142 at 379."
"8718880","8724440"," If you break above 380, a point heading towards the end of your spread, your max gain is right"
"8724440","8724680"," there. "
"8724900","8729100"," You start making max gain at 379, 380, 39."
"8730620","8738580"," So if you think we can maintain or get up to 384 part of earnings season, you'd be doing well."
"8739760","8742800"," You probably have to hold this thing though, right to the end, which sucks. "
"8743180","8744800"," I don't like holding this ship to the end."
"8746860","8747820"," Not a bad trade though."
"8760600","8762700"," I guess unless you thought we were going to have a market meltdown. "
"8765200","8769040"," If you thought we were having a market meltdown, then don't bother."
"8769040","8774100"," Let's look at put spreads on spy for March 17th."
"8774920","8778060"," Let's look at some put spreads. "
"8778880","8786620"," I think we already did this in a day, but it's two, three month put spreads."
"8795460","8796760"," March is not 31st."
"8799040","8804900"," You want to be like March 17th because it'll likely pin into the 31st. "
"8805760","8813160"," It's like March 17th, or if you do it for the 31st, you'd want to close them by the 17th."
"8816880","8818140"," Oh, did it put spread?"
"8819420","8823000"," Oh, yeah, there's some good money you made down there."
"8826580","8829600"," No, I don't want to adjust the order, but I want to buy it. "
"8831460","8831800"," 354?"
"8833160","8834460"," Oh, yeah, that's a good one."
"8842620","8843340"," Oh, man."
"8849680","8850940"," Oh, yeah, that's a good one. "
"8853200","8853640"," 329."
"8858720","8859160"," 350."
"8861760","8863840"," That's a sick ass trade right there, too. "
"8874620","8875920"," It's a pretty baller trade."
"8887400","8888440"," March 17th."
"8889580","8891260"," There's your new low down there. "
"8893540","8895680"," So you'd be in the money retesting lows."
"8897460","8899820"," That's actually a fucking kick ass trade."
"8901200","8909460"," It's like a hundred percent trade retesting the lows by March 17th, and more than a hundred"
"8909460","8913140"," percent, it's like 130 percent or so, 140 percent. "
"8914420","8920540"," Max gains, if we start hemorrhaging, start getting nasty."
"8920920","8922480"," They're getting a bit wrong."
"8924280","8929920"," I think that's why you're seeing like retail traders are just like, retail traders are just like"
"8929920","8930920"," fucking buying puts. "
"8933240","8935020"," Retail traders are like, I don't care."
"8936520","8942500"," I'm going to go on ski vacation and place my puts and go to my bunker and wait until March."
"8962860","8964800"," Hello, my old buddy, my old friend. "
"8969000","8972760"," You know, the female bread trade release that Brian White uses."
"8993820","8994780"," Hold on."
"8996860","8998400"," I'm looking at two strike. "
"8998600","9000140"," I'm looking at two different trades."
"9000180","9008760"," I'm looking for a February 24th call spread in the money."
"9009020","9011460"," I think it's 370, 380 somewhere in there. "
"9015380","9024960"," Then I'm looking for a March 17th put spread that's 350,"
"9024960","9027120"," 379, it's firing March"
"9027120","9040900"," 17th."
"9040900","9041460"," Two different spreads."
"9054000","9055060"," Did you have a chance to look"
"9055060","9070880"," at"
"9070880","9070880"," that gold indicator?"
"9079520","9082640"," Yeah, let me look at the, I've got the put spread up. "
"9082680","9083800"," I'm looking at it right now."
"9085340","9087000"," It's like 371, 370."
"9087580","9092100"," I think it might be 373, 380 on the call side February 24th. "
"9115830","9122490"," Treasury 30 year yield, 3 spot 8% after a racing increase to 3 spot 87%."
"9123470","9124310"," Let me go look"
"9126520","9154020"," at"
"9154020","9154320"," the news real quick."
"9158480","9162140"," Sometimes I like this stuff and sometimes I don't. "
"9162240","9167040"," Sometimes I have to watch this stuff two or three times to kind of like it."
"9167200","9171260"," I don't think I like the first, the first glass onion movie."
"9171400","9172180"," I don't recall it. "
"9172200","9172640"," I liked it."
"9172900","9174980"," The first knives that I don't think I dug it."
"9177760","9179460"," But I don't mind the self. "
"9179780","9180380"," It was really weird."
"9180740","9187760"," People were saying that people were trashing it because it shit on Elon Musk and I was like, I was"
"9187760","9193120"," like, so you're saying that I was like, I was like stuff that's self-depreciating."
"9193780","9201200"," I don't like, I don't mind watching like self-depreciating movies and stuff like that. "
"9201220","9202260"," I think that's kind of funny."
"9204040","9209100"," So I don't know why people are trying to associate it with pissing on Elon Musk and I was like,"
"9209260","9210400"," but I was Elon."
"9210580","9211280"," I would like that movie. "
"9211940","9212720"," It would be great."
"9214780","9215720"," But that's just me."
"9233760","9234640"," Hey, Joe, how are you?"
"9242000","9243720"," They put a book map for you. "
"9251060","9252440"," Yeah, I know me is saying to buy."
"9253080","9256480"," I'm always saying that these dips are to be bought."
"9265900","9267780"," Anemoy is saying, no, no, me. "
"9268200","9269760"," Anemoy is saying these dips are to be bought."
"9280130","9281030"," Nice job, Joe."
"9287760","9288700"," Good morning, Joe. "
"9288880","9289960"," I hope you all have everything as well with you."
"9293180","9294620"," Yeah, I thought last time he was good."
"9295800","9297460"," I haven't always liked his movies. "
"9298420","9299860"," I feel like they put him in the wrong way."
"9300820","9302120"," I didn't care for the Star Wars shit."
"9303000","9307540"," I think I would have liked his take on Star Wars if he had the franchise from the beginning of"
"9307540","9308740"," that three-part series. "
"9310360","9313960"," But I don't like that they just threw him into like part two or something."
"9315860","9320980"," And then I didn't like his Predator movie and then I re-watched it last week after watching The"
"9320980","9321440"," Glass Onion."
"9322220","9322940"," It wasn't bad. "
"9323140","9324380"," It was like a good popcorn movie."
"9331170","9332810"," Yeah, and a darmus."
"9333030","9337130"," You know what I watched last night was I watched the menu. "
"9340430","9342610"," And it was great up until the end."
"9344250","9345470"," It was great up until the end."
"9346030","9347270"," I think other people have said that. "
"9348890","9350610"," There's a little bit too much on the nose."
"9350990","9353470"," There was some on the nose stuff about it that I didn't care for."
"9354350","9355970"," But that's common in movies right now. "
"9356110","9358250"," We have really bad writing in film right now."
"9365850","9367550"," Yeah, John Joe's in the house."
"9370250","9371750"," Right on Joe, good to see you. "
"9372410","9375170"," If you're traveling full time, that's awesome sauce."
"9383990","9385990"," I feel like it drained my brain."
"9388670","9390650"," Yeah, you know, if you can't take. "
"9394550","9398390"," I know that I know that that movie struck a chord with people."
"9400430","9401710"," So I get it."
"9405910","9407570"," He was the first three in and after. "
"9411450","9420760"," Oh, I'm watching John and Joe hang out."
"9421220","9422260"," We all miss Joe."
"9422500","9423600"," We talk about Joe. "
"9423880","9425440"," Just so you know, we talk about you in stream."
"9426000","9427200"," When you're not here, by the way."
"9427940","9429000"," Like where's Joe Nieto?"
"9430080","9430260"," A tower. "
"9446830","9448450"," He just had a story to plot."
"9448930","9450570"," Yeah, I didn't like it."
"9450670","9451830"," I didn't think of it as like a great. "
"9452090","9452570"," A great."
"9452810","9453890"," I didn't think it was a great film."
"9455010","9456630"," So I'm not going to rank it up there with. "
"9457710","9458930"," You need to rewatch it."
"9459990","9464510"," But for like a, you know, pass in the time I've seen worse the past couple of years."
"9466070","9467570"," I didn't like the first one at all. "
"9467730","9469450"," First one I fell asleep or turned it off."
"9469450","9473450"," I was like, yeah, this isn't doing it for me."
"9477610","9478130"," What's that?"
"9478270","9479590"," Let me find out what the director's name is. "
"9483570","9484670"," I always forget his name."
"9485350","9487210"," I think I've met this guy before too."
"9490370","9492690"," I think I met him once in Santa Fe. "
"9500170","9502010"," I could be wrong on that."
"9502410","9505310"," I'm like, swear I've met this guy before."
"9516320","9518720"," So knives out didn't care for it. "
"9520360","9521840"," Star Wars last Jedi."
"9522960","9524320"," The whole series got."
"9524860","9531340"," I would have been fine with Star Wars just being a homage or even a, even if they re-filmed,"
"9532620","9536160"," even if they just remained at the original Star Wars trilogy and fine with that. "
"9536320","9536960"," Looper was great."
"9537760","9538640"," That was a good movie."
"9540860","9541780"," And then he did. "
"9544740","9545820"," So Looper was good."
"9548080","9549060"," What else is he done?"
"9549800","9550900"," I thought he did."
"9551040","9553740"," He directed LCD sound system video. "
"9554060","9555080"," I got to give him props for that."
"9557400","9559440"," That's one of my jams, baby."
"9560960","9561480"," Producer. "
"9561860","9563280"," Yeah, he's not a."
"9564700","9567820"," Let me see here."
"9568180","9569140"," Writer, producer."
"9573280","9575020"," Trying to see what else he's a."
"9577120","9578140"," I thought he had more. "
"9578320","9581760"," I thought he's been a director in more films, but it looks like he hasn't been."
"9592660","9596620"," I thought he had more directorial experience, but it doesn't look like he has."
"9606440","9609800"," I thought he was on predator for some reason. "
"9611680","9614080"," I thought he did predator, but I guess I'm wrong."
"9624720","9630460"," I don't know why I said that predator movies."
"9635460","9636800"," Maybe I'm thinking of somebody else. "
"9640760","9642000"," Is it the predator?"
"9642800","9644100"," Who directed that film?"
"9653800","9657500"," For some reason, I thought that was him and I'm fucking wrong on that."
"9660430","9662710"," The predator, 2018 director."
"9666230","9667050"," Shane Black. "
"9668050","9671370"," That's another guy where I'm like Shane Black, I'm like."
"9672830","9674990"," So I'm mixing up Rianne Johnson and Shane Black."
"9676130","9678870"," Some of his stuff I like and some of his stuff I can pass on. "
"9682350","9683570"," He's like hit or miss for me."
"9684950","9687750"," The nice guys have had to watch it like five times to like it."
"9688250","9689330"," People love that movie. "
"9689710","9690830"," I was like, yeah, it's okay."
"9691490","9692850"," Kiss, kiss, bang, bang was awesome."
"9698790","9699910"," Long kiss, good night. "
"9700950","9703210"," It was actually fondly looked back upon."
"9703410","9706310"," He did the last voice or he did the screenplay for the last voice go."
"9706830","9708770"," He wrote long kiss, good night. "
"9711990","9713170"," He wrote the predator."
"9714570","9716190"," Did he direct the predator as well?"
"9719950","9722670"," It's weird how these guys put their names on shit and they don't."
"9729470","9729910"," Director. "
"9730970","9732190"," Okay, so what did he direct?"
"9733450","9734710"," He directed the predator."
"9740190","9741790"," Kiss, kiss, bang, bang was a good movie."
"9742930","9743590"," Look at this. "
"9743750","9744610"," It makes those guys up."
"9744810","9745870"," Shane Black, Rianne Johnson."
"9749870","9752210"," You know, we're watching paint dry over here, boys and girls. "
"9752430","9753350"," I didn't know if you knew that or not."
"9754690","9757090"," We're talking about everything but the stock market right now."
"9765090","9772450"," So you're getting better by some indicators on ES than you are on spy. "
"9773590","9775470"," So it's the ES versus spy."
"9778910","9779670"," Yes, Dylan."
"9779890","9780650"," That's what we're doing, brother. "
"9795630","9798590"," Yeah, rings of power was the word one."
"9799030","9800290"," Rings of power, man."
"9801730","9802770"," I don't know. "
"9806960","9811420"," There really is bad writing right now."
"9813080","9815960"," There's really, really bad writing out there."
"9818240","9826380"," And then there's the whole argument that you're just misogynist and it's just not true. "
"9830800","9836840"," Like the heroes tail can be told with anyone in the lead, women, man, doesn't matter."
"9838560","9845020"," This is really bizarre, like entertainment is a really bizarre place for me right now."
"9852220","9853580"," It's really bad writing. "
"9861960","9867500"," You know, the other bizarre thing of it too is like the Hobbit was not good either."
"9868680","9870360"," And just wasn't good."
"9871980","9873800"," So I have no problem calling out. "
"9874340","9881180"," I don't know, male-centric movies that are just terrible."
"9896780","9905680"," Yeah, they kind of messed with, there's like, you know, there's some parts that they didn't follow"
"9905680","9911620"," with the original Lord of the Rings trilogy to the books exactly to the books, but what they kept"
"9911620","9912620"," them they did well."
"9912620","9920960"," And then they basically rewrote the story of the Rings of power. "
"9926700","9935460"," You can't spend, you can't spend the budget of a major motion picture for a TV series and not have"
"9935460","9937340"," it become a cultural icon."
"9937340","9940460"," And you can give any reason in the world that you want."
"9941300","9950580"," You can say whatever you want, but you can't spend that kind of money on a property and"
"9950580","9952660"," have it not become a cultural icon. "
"9952960","9955620"," So you saw a game of Thrones become a cultural icon."
"9956400","9961100"," I know that the later seasons were shit upon, but it became a cultural icon."
"9961100","9965180"," You look at Stranger Things, a female lead, right?"
"9965440","9966680"," Stranger Things is a female lead. "
"9967580","9968980"," It became a cultural icon."
"9970540","9973040"," So aliens, cultural icon."
"9974920","9982360"," So if you're spending the money for a cultural icon, it has to become a cultural icon. "
"9984060","9988420"," And when it doesn't, you can make any excuse you want in the book."
"9988820","9989580"," You know what it's like?"
"9989820","9998680"," If any of you have ever played competitive sports, any of you have ever gone to school for and earn"
"9998680","10000980"," grades on a very high level."
"10001900","10002880"," There's no excuse. "
"10004040","10005320"," Anything in life, I guess."
"10005540","10010260"," If you, if your job, you work at a high level, I think it only matters."
"10010260","10014940"," I think if you're like, do I can, the world's best spell arm and spelling be spelling bees all the"
"10014940","10015240"," time. "
"10015800","10025210"," You know at that level that there's no, there's no second place."
"10026890","10033470"," And when I was younger, I was very competitive and, you know, in my mind, in my brain, in my"
"10033470","10037850"," heart, if I didn't, if I wasn't the best, it was never good enough."
"10041110","10044610"," And film is no different television, no different. "
"10045830","10051770"," There are some examples out there where like TV series will get better after the first, first"
"10051770","10052610"," season or so."
"10053490","10056010"," But you know, this is money, right?"
"10056350","10062150"," So these, these, these, you want to become a cultural icon, man."
"10062550","10066970"," If you're going to spend the most money on a TV series, you can't make up excuses. "
"10069590","10072110"," You can, you can, you can say whatever you want."
"10082310","10083190"," Mm hmm."
"10083870","10086470"," Yeah, I see better story lines and video games. "
"10089730","10094030"," There's also like, there's a movement, there's a movement, you guys see it."
"10094030","10099770"," There's a, there's a movement away from film and movies becoming tentpole movies."
"10101930","10104890"," So it's like an experience, like the MCU and all that. "
"10106570","10111610"," And you don't see risk being taken by major movie studios."
"10112170","10113710"," You see it in TV too."
"10114770","10119470"," And there's a, there's an under, there's a behind the scenes war going on right now. "
"10119470","10126030"," Brody Max has a US 30 year fixed mortgage rate, 6.48% for January the 5th versus the 6 "
"10126030","10128970",".42% for the prior week."
"10130710","10136630"," There's this really bizarre under, under the surface."
"10137810","10140450"," You've got young children right now. "
"10141530","10145370"," And somewhat up until even if to like 40, 50 years old."
"10147290","10155890"," There's been a transition to content that's immediate and content that is all the time."
"10156890","10160050"," So you just want more, more, more to consume more, more, more. "
"10161010","10164530"," And your attention spans are becoming even smaller and smaller, right?"
"10164790","10167970"," So you get all that going on the background."
"10167970","10177770"," And so you've got, you've got creators, like musicians, you've got actors, you've"
"10177770","10186610"," got writers, you've got all these content creators that are moving away from the studio systems."
"10187430","10194390"," Like the writers, their singers, they're moving into social media, TikTok, Twitch, YouTube. "
"10195710","10203610"," You see the impact and the quality of content produced on movies and TV specifically."
"10205320","10211740"," You see a repetitive, more repetitiveness than ever in top 40 kind of stuff in music."
"10213040","10217920"," And then very smart and wealthy people see this as well. "
"10219040","10225680"," So there's even a war going on for the control of that talent on social media."
"10228780","10232920"," He saw Mr. Beast go on Twitter just a couple weeks ago."
"10233540","10243120"," Elon Media or Elon for a brief moment tried to ban posting to competitor hosting sites and then"
"10243120","10245280"," rescinded it within a few hours, I think. "
"10245980","10251000"," But that is the intent to go there at some point for Elon and everyone else."
"10251180","10256640"," This includes like Google, it includes the fight with chat, chat, TPT."
"10261060","10265080"," And who controls that next wave of content. "
"10265600","10271720"," You see it on YouTube, you can see very highly produced content on YouTube right now."
"10272420","10280260"," If you look at some of the content that you're consuming on YouTube, there's serious money behind"
"10280260","10281040"," some of this content."
"10282080","10286920"," And it's not for a payoff today, it's for a decade from now. "
"10290640","10295740"," So even like the shine that movies once had is gone, right?"
"10295940","10303800"," And you're seeing it with the 10-pole movies and you're seeing it with no risk being taken in movie"
"10303800","10304220"," making."
"10307220","10312180"," And you're seeing it with who's in charge of what is entertainment changing hands right now too."
"10314180","10323260"," It's probably look back in the decade or two and it'll probably take a decade or two for like the"
"10323260","10327180"," full golden era or golden age of, well, it's not golden. "
"10327580","10334720"," The golden age of YouTube was a decade ago, but the golden age for the young generations is going"
"10334720","10340520"," to be centered around these TikTok-type environments."
"10342380","10350520"," Twitch and VR to some extent, 10 cents, all that kind of stuff."
"10370020","10385520"," Yeah, we had boards speaking earlier this morning, two at eight a.m. Yeah,"
"10385560","10395960"," if you look at, you can see the steep drop off and movie quality started in like 2015, 2016, 17. "
"10396900","10401600"," As a matter of fact, I was looking through, I was looking through my movie library yesterday, the"
"10401600","10402380"," internet was off."
"10402620","10409400"," So I'm like, I'll take a look, I have an intranet in my house to have like intranet."
"10410500","10418280"," I have like Wikipedia on a server and I've got music and YouTube videos, like long format YouTube"
"10418280","10425900"," videos and pictures and movies and TV shows and audio books and ebooks and all kinds of nonsense. "
"10425900","10429920"," So if like the internet ever goes down, it's for sailing."
"10430240","10434480"," So if you go sailing, you don't have the internet, you don't have an intranet for yourself."
"10436340","10437460"," Like a mini internet. "
"10438220","10447900"," So I was looking through my movie catalogues yesterday and there's like a giant black hole during"
"10447900","10449700"," COVID of quality films."
"10450320","10455860"," And then I noticed that my movies from 2021 and 2022 were were very low as well."
"10456800","10460680"," Like I had have some movies, but not ones that rewatch again. "
"10461400","10466400"," And so then I looked at last night, I took a minute to look through the year and review for"
"10466400","10474460"," 2022 and I was shocked at the how slim the pickings were for movies that I was like, yeah, this"
"10474460","10477620"," will be a great movie to rewatch in five years or 10 years."
"10479620","10480600"," There weren't many."
"10481740","10490440"," Even after even post COVID, especially you look back at other years and you look back at like"
"10490440","10496560"," early 2000s mid 2000s 1990s, 1980s, 1970s. "
"10501540","10505880"," Some of the worst TV is probably the 50s and 60s in my view."
"10509740","10512080"," I probably related to that time period."
"10519460","10524360"," You guys want to see a larger look at book map right here. "
"10528330","10529630"," Switch back to the regular mainstream."
"10552730","10555550"," Go goes about to start squeezing here."
"10555550","10560550"," I should have mentioned that. "
"10564110","10565910"," Nice little squeeze plan go go."
"10567310","10568650"," Couple targets up above."
"10569130","10569830"," Got some sellers. "
"10574130","10575270"," Previously here."
"10581670","10584090"," Giant got above at 16."
"10592130","10593290"," That's go go. "
"10608820","10610560"," Has some velocity behind it."
"10612240","10617120"," Breaking about the trigger on the on the 186 of 1507."
"10617120","10621900"," Price target above 1557. "
"10623000","10624540"," Close the gap at 1608."
"10624540","10653940"," We'll"
"10653940","10653960"," get some others real quick."
"10665360","10667320"," Maybe worth at least watching. "
