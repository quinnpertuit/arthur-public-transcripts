"434710","439690"," You've got like these massive shorts on the market and then you've got a bunch of retail traders"
"439690","442410"," trying to jump in and time the the JPM caller."
"443050","445850"," So you've got these you've got these other mechanics in the background. "
"446830","448250"," It's almost like Elliott wave."
"448250","449330"," You know Elliott wave."
"449370","450890"," Sometimes you got to break out the erasers. "
"451170","453290"," Sometimes the only waveman nails it."
"453750","455090"," But when it doesn't nail it."
"455530","456790"," It doesn't right. "
"457030","461090"," And so you get you get jammed up in a in a trade or you know you're drinking the Kool "
"461090","461630","-Aid in a trade."
"462230","466370"," But the point behind what I'm saying to you is that people still trade to it."
"466450","472590"," So even if it breaks through or goes higher than what's predicted it's still like this the speed"
"472590","479330"," bump along the way right because you know that traders are trading to V-Wops and moving averages"
"479330","486050"," and Elliott wave theories and fucking triangles and expanding fucking megaphone wedges and all that"
"486050","486810"," kind of shit right. "
"489560","492640"," Yeah everything got people trading to the moon cycles out there."
"493260","496220"," Got people trading to Biden's speeches and stuff."

"502960","505060"," right now I got another white bar and I keep saying white. "
"505440","511640"," I got to change the bars and this fucking thing because I got green bars and white bars."
"512039","512840"," I'll show it to you right here."
"514179","516960"," So I got Christmas colors up on this chart right here. "
"518080","522280"," So instead of calling it like a green candles I'm like yeah we got white candles."
"522960","524820"," So I'll change the candle color."
"525300","526040"," Pull out here. "
"527880","530080"," Let me see if I can figure out how to change it now."
"530220","532360"," I always forget how to fucking change the colors and this shit."
"535680","539800"," Maybe it's inside of a parent's. "
"547400","548920"," What am I looking for here?"

"1827870","1828350"," There you go."
"1829130","1829250"," Easy. "
"1832310","1833970"," A little more."
"1836250","1837250"," Well, you know what?"
"1837410","1837650"," Fuck it."
"1840470","1843330"," All right, I started at 87 cents. "
"1843690","1845270"," We're probably going to come down here, but I don't care."
"1845350","1846730"," I'm going to add to the position right here."
"1848490","1849270"," We're bullish. "
"1854810","1855590"," We're supportive."
"1859270","1860810"," Not a bad trade right there."
"1860950","1861990"," 405, man. "
"1862430","1863190"," That's a great trade."
"1868350","1873530"," If you're just joining us for the first time, you can always go down to the preferences of the"
"1873530","1874110"," YouTube video."
"1874590","1877910"," A little cogwheel that you see down in that YouTube. "
"1879910","1883150"," App or whatever you're in watching this on a computer or something."
"1883570","1885890"," You can click on that little cogwheel down there for preferences."
"1886910","1888110"," You'll see playback speed. "
"1889050","1891150"," You click that button and press times two."
"1891970","1893330"," My voice will sound like a clown."
"1893570","1894570"," I am a clown, right?"
"1894690","1895230"," We don't know that. "
"1895850","1896990"," I'll click on that button."
"1897150","1898090"," I'll speed up a little bit."
"1899410","1902330"," And then I will my voice will turn back to normal. "
"1903210","1907330"," And you can be live with me maybe just a few second delay, three seconds, four seconds."
"1908310","1910330"," But depending on how good your internet speed is."
"1916730","1919030"," Oh, my calls are already up to 91 cents. "
"1919790","1920190"," Sweet."
"1922030","1922770"," I'm long here."
"1922890","1926870"," I'm not a well, I don't think we're going to roll this over yet, but here's what you need to"
"1926870","1928210"," know if you're just joining me for the first time. "
"1930410","1934130"," What I'm looking for right here is what I'm looking for a couple of things."
"1934990","1936090"," Joining us for the first time."
"1938350","1939750"," We are supportive right now. "
"1939750","1941130"," We're above the one minute trigger."
"1941130","1944010"," And so we're going to do is we're going to."
"1944930","1949390"," Just right in here for me, at least this is for entertainment purposes only. "
"1950390","1952610"," This is not you should not be trading what I trade."
"1952610","1957510"," You should be seeking out professional financial advice."
"1959750","1963650"," And this is more of entertainment for you to watch me lose all of my money. "
"1965630","1970630"," But when I when I make a trade, I normally I normally look for a place that I want to"
"1970630","1971050"," put a stop."
"1971050","1973790"," Sometimes they get stopped out of it, but my test stops too high."
"1975490","1977910"," If I know that we're in some kind of consolidation. "
"1979210","1981950"," Or if I think that we are right, I'm anticipating taking risk on."
"1982950","1989870"," I'm trying to do is buy some calls in here and then deciding where I want to put some stops."
"1990950","1993370"," So now this five minute line right here, right?"
"1993590","1999870"," I'll typically put my stops down here and I will actually do I will add to my position here. "
"2002530","2006990"," This is very not risky, but it's taking on a lot of risk now at this moment, I didn't buy"
"2006990","2011890"," some, but had we gone down a little bit more, I would have added to my position talking to you."
"2011970","2013610"," I'm kind of paying attention to you guys, not me."
"2015210","2019050"," So this is kind of where I am when I take along if I think we're being supportive right now. "
"2020350","2026710"," As long as I we stay out over this blue line right here and we make a new high, we're"
"2026710","2027750"," supportive in my view."
"2027750","2028610"," Okay."
"2029750","2030830"," The market is supportive. "
"2031950","2034070"," So let's say I'm wrong, right?"
"2034670","2038790"," If I'm wrong in my trade, right, I have a plan already in place."
"2038810","2041050"," I already know that this is where I want to buy."
"2041790","2046410"," I know that if we trade below the five minute right here. "
"2048090","2050270"," I'm going to take, lick my wounds, right?"
"2050429","2053150"," Lick my wounds and be like, oh, trade didn't work for me, right?"
"2058090","2061250"," And then I've got a price target above already planned out, right?"
"2061610","2062429"," You might do diligence."
"2062469","2066130"," I'm looking at previous closes, previous highs."
"2066570","2070190"," I'm looking at the top of this channel that I already laid this out a few weeks ago. "
"2071010","2074730"," And so in my mind, I'm like, okay, so we're supportive right now."
"2074790","2076969"," I'm doing all these, these things in my brain and I'm going, okay."
"2077010","2080290"," So maybe the first time we have a failure up here, right?"
"2080469","2081969"," We got no previous highs to worry about. "
"2082969","2085150"," But we might have a failure in the first try to get up there."
"2085670","2086350"," So what do I do?"
"2086570","2089510"," I buy some calls, right?"
"2090429","2092429"," And then I wait for the move to go my way."
"2093370","2097610"," And then I look at the, the winnings and I go, hmm, how much money do I want to take"
"2097610","2098590"," out of the market today?"
"2099590","2100370"," You get what I'm saying?"
"2101970","2104970"," Do you get what I'm saying?"
"2108770","2110190"," Do I take 10%?"
"2110810","2112030"," Do I take 20%?"
"2112390","2113450"," Do I take 100%?"
"2114270","2116390"," How much do I feel like taking this morning?"
"2121130","2123430"," Do I want to dive in and into the clothes?"
"2123690","2124270"," What do I want to do?"
"2128730","2129710"," Does that make sense?"
"2131230","2132230"," That's how you day trade, right?"
"2138470","2140830"," Uh, four, zero, six. "
"2143450","2145050"," Four, zero, six."
"2149380","2152280"," Hey, you're not paper handed."
"2153100","2153920"," A win is a win. "
"2154140","2159700"," You take 10%, 20%, 50%, you can do that nine times in a row."
"2160960","2164520"," You do like, you do that like nine, 10 times in a row and you have one banger."
"2165560","2166200"," I should say less. "
"2166440","2168480"," You do that five times in a row and you have one banger."
"2169240","2176800"," You need like, probably need like one to five to seven, 10 to 20% winners."
"2177720","2181160"," You need one banger, like trend day. "
"2181340","2182460"," You know it's trend day."
"2183460","2188600"," You just keep hitting it and you can take probably two full 100% losses."
"2191000","2193920"," Now, you shouldn't be taking 100% losses. "
"2195480","2197020"," You have stops down here."
"2197020","2198720"," You won't take 100% losses."
"2200160","2205160"," A lot of people stay in their trades and they're like, no, no, no, it's coming back. "
"2205280","2206040"," It's coming back."
"2206180","2209260"," So you have to have defined losses, right?"
"2210340","2214880"," If your methodology is not getting you to where you want to go right away, this is funny."
"2215020","2218820"," Yesterday I was in here and I did the same thing, right?"
"2218980","2219260"," What happened?"
"2222760","2223560"," We went up here. "
"2223720","2224180"," We came down."
"2224340","2225120"," We came up reversed."
"2225800","2227840"," And I was like, oop, we didn't hit the stop. "
"2229220","2230540"," And then it came back up."
"2230660","2233280"," And I was like, I'm not fucking around with this sideways shit."
"2233480","2235820"," And I could tell that they were trying to bleed off calls. "
"2236080","2236480"," So I got out."
"2237220","2238100"," I just got out."
"2238340","2240360"," I think I lost two pennies or four pennies or something. "
"2241580","2244340"," But then it came up and blasted up later on."
"2244460","2246380"," I ended up having lunch yesterday, so I missed the trade."
"2248000","2252240"," But you have a trade plan, trade plan, tire trade plan. "
"2253260","2253960"," You get me?"
"2254980","2257780"," And your shit should be going the way that you thought it was going."
"2258060","2258640"," Does that make sense?"
"2258980","2260920"," Your shit ain't going the way you thought you're going."
"2261340","2267340"," If I'm buying right here and I should have been buying down here, right, or adding down here, you"
"2267340","2268200"," need to think about this. "
"2268620","2269540"," Everything that you do."
"2270180","2270960"," You understand what I'm saying?"
"2272160","2274400"," You should have your trade planned out from start to finish."
"2275500","2275900"," Does that make sense?"
"2276120","2276760"," How long does it take?"
"2276960","2279980"," How much time do I need on the call or the put that I'm buying?"
"2280960","2281960"," How about the theta burn?"
"2282220","2283800"," How about the how far of a delta?"
"2284040","2284920"," How much to pay, right?"
"2285180","2285960"," What is the delta pay?"
"2288170","2290550"," When is it not going my way?"
"2301880","2302640"," Ooh, S bucks. "
"2304680","2307180"," I'm going to show some S bucks porn."
"2314520","2325760"," Hold on a second here."
"2354010","2367510"," Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh,"

"2395750","2396950"," You're going to start squosing."
"2397770","2399130"," What's going on up here?"
"2399550","2400050"," What's happening?"

"2400550","2401070"," What are you going to do?"
"2403630","2408170"," Oh, are you going to push spy up Tesla now, but you're going to blast us up and out of"

"2646750","2652590"," here that we can trade we can try to have a failure possibly up here right."
"2653290","2655230"," You're going to start trapping some bulls up in here. "
"2655310","2659590"," We could have a failure up in here and then we start to consolidate back down then make another"
"2659590","2660390"," move into the bell."
"2661430","2666510"," You want to be watching the options chain because if we've got a stack up we don't have a stack"
"2666510","2670810"," of puts right now but if we do stay into the market or something like that or if it's get"
"2670810","2677170"," too cheap you'll you'll end up seeing calls get hold on a second here."
"2678330","2680770"," Put this one right here just in case. "
"2684470","2690670"," You'll start to cheapen the price of calls so that they expire either worthless or much less than"
"2690670","2691890"," what everybody is in right."
"2692790","2697010"," We need more rounds of buyers here you can kind of see us slowing slightly here."
"2697850","2701470"," You'll see less buyers right they'll get panicky to buy right here. "
"2701590","2702930"," You can buy right here but you want to wait a minute."
"2703970","2706910"," You want to set this up just like before right."
"2707750","2713510"," We have ad down here we've got a stop down here and we've got a buy right on this blue"
"2713510","2719370"," line right here and this is for the liquidity breakdown below so we'll keep this down here and then"
"2719370","2722050"," we're going to write this right here and we're going to buy right over here. "
"2722310","2727000"," Just in case we're in trend day today."
"2727240","2732600"," Now when you're in a trend day, trend day is typically you get at least three pumps sometimes you"
"2732600","2733580"," get four or five."
"2734160","2736420"," I think we're in pump number two right now right. "
"2736640","2736940"," What are we on?"
"2737740","2741640"," One, two, so to get one more is not unreasonable."
"2743520","2745960"," Now this might not actually even consolidate that much."
"2746140","2750100"," Typically you get at least three but not always we'll clean this up for you. "
"2750780","2756820"," I think clean this up a little bit and you see how it's taking a little bit of time for"
"2756820","2757760"," the blue line to come up."
"2758480","2759740"," So we're going to watch this here."
"2760900","2764580"," I'm probably going to reenter on what's the target above. "
"2765420","2768760"," Probably something in the money four seven sixty three four eight."
"2770720","2772260"," We might get four or eight."
"2773660","2774740"," I'm taking the risk. "
"2778400","2779640"," I'm watching it right now."
"2780920","2782060"," Right off that belt."

"2819580","2822920"," all these call holders up here or destroy all these put holders down here. "

"2862020","2862800"," We're knocking boots. "
"2864040","2868000"," One, no, two, no, three, no, send it down."
"2868760","2869580"," One, no."
"2874760","2877560"," Slap that ask right there, right?"
"2877960","2878920"," Slap that ask. "
"2879820","2880480"," Look at that."
"2881460","2882440"," Slap that ask."
"2883820","2886320"," Huge, huge moves. "
"2888340","2888700"," Huge."
"2890300","2891840"," Tacking previous high up here."
"2891900","2892940"," What do bulls need to do?"
"2893780","2895640"," What do you all know what bulls need to do?"
"2896200","2901360"," They need to get up here, build some strength and smash through this one right here, right?"
"2901960","2902840"," That's what they need to do. "
"2906580","2907880"," We're going to talk about that today."
"2908920","2912120"," We're going to talk about what the bulls need, what the bears need."
"2914920","2916200"," I'm going to show it nice and easy. "
"2916300","2918780"," If we're making it nice and easy for you, if you're a bull or a bear."
"2920560","2922000"," Nice and easy for you."
"2922120","2924620"," Still haven't gotten my buy signal down here, so I'm still waiting. "
"2925220","2930540"," I might not catch this one because if it just trades sideways for a few minutes, time is it?"
"2930740","2931280"," 10, 16?"
"2932240","2937020"," I'm looking for the, another thing to think about is I'm looking for the 10.30 for the next hour"
"2937020","2941640"," of power and seeing if we can get up here at least."
"2944780","2945660"," Yeah, 4100."
"2946120","2947480"," That's like 407, isn't it?"
"2947680","2949380"," Was like $3 in change right now?"
"2950480","2951180"," Right here. "
"2951360","2952040"," That's where that one is."
"2952220","2957100"," I think it's $3 like 20 cents difference being asked to inspire right now."
"2957540","2964970"," I don't know exactly what it is the moment, but Okay, let's look at S-Pucks real quick. "
"2965050","2966750"," Let's get a winky all fired up."
"2969690","2970950"," Let's get them all hot and sweaty."
"2976330","2977910"," What are we talking about in S-Pucks here?"
"2978050","2978210"," Let's look. "
"2978390","2980370"," Oh yeah, S-Pucks is um, uh, I see."
"2981990","2987110"," You know, um, uh, no, no."
"2987510","2993910"," So S-Pucks, if you're not already in it, uh, this is going to go against what winky wants to"
"2993910","2994070"," hear. "
"2996250","3000690"," I'll as well say what S-Pucks because I'm going to say what S-Pucks, okay?"
"3001410","3009510"," Uh, to me S-Pucks is a short, not right now, but whenever their ER is, it's a short to"
"3009510","3009670"," me."
"3010790","3012350"," They're very bullish right now."
"3012690","3013430"," I'm going to give it to you. "
"3013710","3014590"," They're very, very bullish."
"3015650","3018090"," Uh, they're coming into their first point of resistance right now."
"3018230","3018950"," We know that, right?"
"3019750","3021150"," Right now they're coming into some resistance. "
"3022890","3023870"," They're coming off."
"3024210","3026010"," They're looking for this high that they had at $122."
"3026670","3027690"," Are we checking it right now?"
"3030640","3039360"," If you were to take S-Pucks as a cyclical trade, uh, still has a little bit more room to"
"3039360","3039620"," run. "
"3039940","3047220"," So if you're gonna, I guess, I guess maybe, maybe Winky's point is, uh, we can run to, Winky"
"3047220","3049260"," probably thinks we can run to 125ish, right?"
"3049540","3050700"," Somewhere in there, 125, 126."
"3052600","3054180"," Uh, hold on."
"3055700","3057340"," Okay, I'll just try, you guys want to try it out?"
"3057340","3058800"," Cuz I'm waiting here, I think. "
"3059340","3060320"," So we'll chart it out."
"3061180","3062400"," So let's look at S-Pucks."
"3069750","3073730"," Okay, and let's do a daily chart in S-Pucks. "
"3075850","3077610"," Let's come over there, right over there."
"3078070","3078230"," Okay."
"3080130","3081810"," We know that it gets bought, right?"
"3082070","3083250"," We can see right here it gets bought. "
"3084350","3088230"," So you got some algorithms or something that's buying it down here, right?"
"3088230","3098210"," A whole bunch of, uh, we know that down here we have buyers, right?"
"3099150","3099590"," Buyers, buyers."
"3100290","3102470"," Oh, hold on."
"3102730","3104650"," No fib lines to get fibs. "
"3105350","3107370"," You know, stinking fibs."
"3107450","3108650"," We know this is where they're long, right?"
"3112920","3119220"," We know that, uh, up here, they're long too, right?"
"3119760","3122900"," Uh, secondary buyers came in here."
"3126090","3130010"," This is actually very bullish here because you can see that they didn't really wait too long. "
"3130010","3130850"," Just start running."
"3132650","3134690"," Whoever got trapped in here didn't get too panicky."
"3135570","3137090"," Uh, there wasn't like a back and forth. "
"3137270","3138590"," This is, this is positive to see."
"3138910","3141570"," Like not seeing a bunch of this is kind of key."
"3141910","3143450"," People are, they's like, uh, no one care. "
"3143610","3144430"," They just like said, fuck it."
"3144530","3146790"," We're waiting until this consolidates or go, we're off and running again."
"3146910","3148450"," That's pretty bullish to be honest with you. "
"3148450","3151670"," Uh, now you've got a, some people stuck up here."
"3152730","3159650"," Now you've got some, some trap seller, or you get some trapped, uh, buyers up in here, but these"
"3159650","3163090"," trap buyers, man, they might not be as strong as you think."
"3163690","3167950"," Only because it's Starbucks, you probably have, this is like a Tesla gang trade, right?"
"3168710","3171190"," Tesla gang is like, I don't care and buying it. "
"3171390","3172810"," And I don't care from trapped up here."
"3172870","3173690"," We're coming back here anyways."
"3174050","3174350"," I'm assuming. "
"3174990","3176370"," Uh, that's, that's it, right?"
"3176510","3178710"," So you got some, this is like a cautionary here."
"3179350","3187470"," Uh, and then you've got, uh, surely you've got some more panic sellers above here on this high."
"3187610","3188750"," They're going to be like, nah, I ain't going up there. "
"3188790","3189390"," I'm too scared."
"3190510","3194510"," Um, and then you've got this trend that people are following."
"3195230","3198130"," I'm assuming that people that didn't sell, they were like, not fuck that. "
"3199790","3202830"," They're like, this is, this is the way, ooh, this is the way we're going."
"3203150","3203710"," Oh, hold on a second."
"3203830","3204410"," I don't know what's going on. "
"3205390","3206490"," They're like, we're on trend."
"3208510","3210410"," Like, all I, why am I here?"
"3211270","3212710"," I don't know what's going on here."
"3214150","3219750"," Like, all I have to worry about, all I have to worry about is right there. "
"3221710","3225250"," As long as I worry about that little red line, whether it's real or not, doesn't matter."
"3226350","3228190"," Um, you get what I'm saying?"
"3228910","3230170"," So you know, this is probably top."
"3230430","3235350"," So just, just right now, uh, one hour chart, super bullish, right?"
"3235470","3236290"," Just super bullish. "
"3237470","3239610"," Uh, daily chart, super bullish."
"3239990","3241310"," Look at that beautiful chart right there."
"3241410","3241850"," That's just monster. "
"3243010","3248550"," Uh, if you were trying to take this trade long right now, like I'm jumping on board, uh, price"
"3248550","3252870"," target above, uh, you've got, uh, right now is kind of a caution zone."
"3253170","3256430"," Uh, but price, if you want the real part, price target above, you're probably gonna be telling"
"3256430","3260290"," people it's probably, uh, 125.03, something like that."
"3261830","3267370"," On a 15 minute chart, uh, you've got buyers here, right?"
"3268210","3271730"," A lot of space to run up here, but this is all caution, right?"
"3272510","3274690"," Um, five minute chart, bullish. "
"3275550","3276910"," You want to pick this up."
"3277510","3284870"," You're trying to buy, uh, 108.67. Uh, on a one minute, excuse me."
"3285250","3290410"," On a one minute, you're trying to buy, uh, 108.67. And that, and the, oh, sorry, I'm doing this"
"3290410","3290590"," wrong. "
"3290970","3291330"," My bad."
"3292610","3293770"," Uh, cancel all that."
"3294410","3297310"," Uh, 108.96, you're trying to stay on trend here. "
"3297950","3300650"," Uh, this is where your buy, add, and stops are."
"3301170","3306350"," And then this is on a daily chart, uh, 108.65, cut it loose."
"3307850","3311350"," So if you're trading just intraday, this is what you're looking for right here. "
"3313250","3317350"," Um, and you're looking for new highs, although all the stuff I taught teaching you guys applies"
"3317350","3318290"," every day."
"3318390","3319730"," You got a new high, right?"
"3320650","3324370"," Didn't get a new high, went down to the five minute, got a new high."
"3324550","3324890"," Make sense?"
"3326130","3327850"," Uh, stops down in here, right?"
"3330680","3334920"," Uh, trend, if you're looking for what, what is trend on S bucks?"
"3335820","3338080"," Uh, some people like the four hour, I like the one hour. "
"3338540","3340620"," Personally, I think the one hour tells you fast from the four."
"3341380","3346700"," Uh, if you break the, uh, if you break 107.99, you've broken hourly trend on the day."
"3347000","3348420"," That's your daily trend breaking. "
"3349140","3354480"," If you, if you, if we start to, if S bucks starts to roll over, like the whole stock is"
"3354480","3358120"," rolling over, uh, you're looking right now to break 104 42."
"3358960","3361600"," This is like full on bloodbath right down there."
"3361660","3361880"," Boom. "
"3362540","3363180"," Makes sense."
"3363620","3365140"," See that daily trigger right there?"
"3365440","3365460"," Boom."
"3366100","3366500"," Done. "
"3367180","3368820"," So you got to stay above right now."
"3368880","3370940"," 104 34 on S bucks."
"3372200","3373720"," Oops, there's S bucks for you. "
"3373800","3375060"," And I'll show you one last thing on S bucks."
"3375760","3379480"," Um, and just to show that it's extremely bullish."
"3380500","3384500"," Uh, just to show how bullish is above all of its triggers. "
"3384780","3388700"," This is where Apple is right now, above Apple's just coming above all this stuff."
"3389800","3396200"," Um, so, so if you're out there being a bear and saying we're rolling the market over, I don't know,"
"3396280","3398400"," maybe, but be wary."
"3398840","3399120"," All right. "
"3399580","3406060"," Uh, so if you're looking on, looking on, um, looking for a roll over on star, on Starbucks, it's"
"3406060","3410720"," 107 61 for your hourly and then your daily is 104 31."
"3411460","3412480"," How high does it go?"
"3412660","3414160"," We, we, we charted it out for you."
"3414460","3419480"," Uh, this is extremely bullish, but if it starts to lose momentum, uh, the thing about being"
"3419480","3424420"," bullish, this bullish is if it starts to, if you start to lose momentum, usually you're getting a"
"3424420","3430800"," rollover to find where real support is on an hourly daily, weekly, monthly, until buyers step back"
"3430800","3431000"," in. "
"3431800","3432360"," Make sense?"
"3439060","3440100"," I'm still hanging here."
"3440560","3441840"," I haven't bought anything here yet."
"3442560","3444060"," Uh, we got a little bit of a tag down below. "
"3444720","3446720"," So now I'm looking for this five minutes to get hit."
"3447380","3448740"," I'll just do a little bit of a breakdown below."
"3452820","3453440"," Pull in here. "
"3453640","3457340"," Let's take a look around the market real quick and just see how everything's, how everything looks"
"3457340","3457780"," right now."
"3457960","3458680"," I'm going to check on the VIX."
"3461340","3463020"," 18 bucks and 15 cents. "
"3463160","3464260"," Isn't that a retest down below?"
"3465280","3466280"," We're almost there."
"3468180","3469080"," We're almost down there."
"3473030","3474930"," Almost tested it out down here. "
"3475310","3480830"," This is a previous, uh, previous low that we tagged and there's lower than we can go, believe it or"
"3480830","3481050"," not."
"3481290","3487650"," And we will fall more the more, more probable is that we're going to enter a new bull market and"
"3487650","3489610"," then we'll blast up if we start breaking through."
"3489810","3495430"," So we've got a previous low here, 1802, maybe a little bit more, more push to go. "
"3495510","3499270"," It'd be nice to see VIX come up and then come back down and tag it."
"3502650","3503610"," And HYG."
"3506670","3508170"," I don't like seeing this. "
"3511250","3513450"," I do not like seeing this right here."
"3515570","3519990"," HYG is like, fuck no, this is all just a squeeze and this is not a good sign right here."
"3520090","3522890"," And this makes sense to a point to make sense. "
"3523330","3528550"," Watch seeing this with HYG because we should get a, um, I'm just going to show us an SPX."
"3529910","3531770"," This makes sense for both bulls and bears."
"3532190","3533490"," We're going to look at SPX real quick. "
"3536050","3537990"," I'm going to show you something here in SPX."
"3539950","3541170"," Daily chart SPX."
"3541450","3541710"," Okay. "
"3542430","3543250"," Make this simple."
"3544650","3546970"," This is our day or this is going to be for next week."
"3547090","3549170"," I want you guys to pay close attention to this. "
"3549770","3550750"," I want you to pay attention."
"3551750","3552670"," Very important."
"3552670","3553070"," Okay. "
"3554370","3556150"," You pay attention and I'll explain this."
"3556470","3558210"," I did the work already for this."
"3558470","3562670"," I'm going to make it simple for you real quick so that you can understand this in a better light. "
"3562750","3562930"," Okay."
"3564570","3567690"," I'm going to throw on a, I'm going to get rid of this right here."
"3569750","3570750"," And indicators. "
"3572050","3573310"," No people trade to this, right?"
"3573310","3573370"," Okay."
"3575010","3575710"," Here's 200."
"3577250","3578370"," 200 day moving average. "
"3579050","3579830"," Real simple."
"3581250","3581730"," Okay."
"3584460","3588420"," We knew we threw it over right, slammed down, rejected, slammed down, right?"
"3588620","3589680"," Rejected, slammed down. "
"3590080","3590600"," Oh, not enough."
"3591760","3592720"," Came back up, rejected."
"3593140","3594020"," Came back up, rejected. "
"3594320","3595000"," Uh oh, maybe not."
"3595660","3595940"," Rejected."
"3596760","3598100"," Here, fair trap, right?"
"3599140","3600820"," We thought we were going down here, right?"
"3600980","3601320"," Didn't happen. "
"3602360","3606800"," Uh no, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll chart all this out for you right now so you can see it"
"3606800","3606980"," too."
"3607120","3608180"," But before you, we do that."
"3608620","3610400"," If we chart it out, I'm going to show you some important. "
"3610400","3610760"," Okay."
"3612420","3616260"," Now, bulls, for bulls, this doesn't matter that we're squeezing."
"3617580","3619440"," All they needed to do is get above here. "
"3620040","3621620"," That's it with just enough."
"3622860","3623960"," That's all they needed to do."
"3624720","3626780"," They don't need to go to 420 right now. "
"3626800","3627800"," They don't need to go for 60."
"3628060","3628560"," None of that shit."
"3629400","3632320"," So all the check marks are on the book on the bare bulls right now, right?"
"3633180","3635560"," Um, you see the cup, you see the handle. "
"3636120","3638860"," You can actually measure this usually, how high it goes."
"3638860","3639180"," Okay."
"3639860","3640480"," Right there. "
"3640560","3641040"," You guys see it?"
"3642900","3644500"," There's a cup and handle complete."
"3644840","3646000"," There's another check mark for the bulls."
"3646820","3649860"," Now, you have the GPM caller, right?"
"3650060","3651700"," We've got all this other shit, right?"
"3651900","3654440"," People want to short this mark down to the depths of how we've got the fed. "
"3654580","3656840"," We've got JPAL coming out, blah, blah, blah."
"3657880","3660480"," None of that really matters for you as a trader."
"3660920","3662560"," I'm going to show you what matters, okay?"
"3663700","3665280"," As an investor, I'm going to show you what matters. "
"3666580","3668140"," I'm going to show you right now what matters."
"3670540","3673660"," I'm going to get rid of this line here in just a minute, but I'm going to go back to"
"3673660","3674100"," something else."
"3674220","3674880"," I'm going to show you something. "
"3676520","3684260"," But really, truly, the key is here is that the, a real true, I know these are just lines, they"
"3684260","3686420"," mean nothing, but I'll show you better later on."
"3687220","3688640"," I'm going to show you something different here."
"3690870","3692190"," I want to show you something here, okay?"
"3693970","3695070"," See this cross right here?"
"3698320","3699880"," Kind of a key thing right here, okay?"
"3703520","3706420"," Now, and I'm going to change this line out here for a minute. "
"3706520","3708320"," I just want to, this is the confirmation for bulls."
"3708620","3709280"," Yeah, you made it higher."
"3710620","3711180"," Where we go from here. "
"3712480","3713840"," And if you're a bear, where do we go from here?"
"3715440","3718020"," As a bear, you want to break through this trend right here."
"3718200","3718800"," And that was my point."
"3719000","3723020"," We could come down 5% right now, and we haven't even broken trend. "
"3723520","3724200"," You have to understand it."
"3724280","3724620"," You're a bear."
"3724700","3726100"," I'm going to talk to the bears first, okay?"
"3727340","3728480"," Here's me to understand this. "
"3730080","3731340"," If we sell, right?"
"3731920","3733400"," Here's your first trade down."
"3734560","3735360"," Okay, that's it."
"3735460","3736240"," That's all you can take. "
"3737040","3738120"," That's all you can take."
"3738280","3740300"," You wrap it up and you get out."
"3740740","3740940"," You understand?"
"3743600","3746300"," Then you have to take this trade right here. "
"3747800","3750440"," That's like 380, 375, okay?"
"3752160","3753320"," That's your next trade."
"3754200","3755880"," Your next trade below, it's what?"
"3756480","3758120"," 348, 345, something like that."
"3758280","3758960"," That's your next trade. "
"3760740","3762860"," And that only gets to like 350, 360."
"3763540","3765560"," That doesn't get to the bloodbath that you're looking for."
"3766120","3769860"," Now, this is bearish if we break below here, okay?"
"3770780","3771680"," This is bearish. "
"3772380","3778540"," So bulls need to hold only this average."
"3778860","3779880"," This is all you need to hold."
"3780220","3782340"," You can actually roll this over and make a move higher. "
"3782620","3782980"," No problem."
"3783440","3785380"," You can bounce underneath it."
"3785540","3789800"," As long as it doesn't get a rejection to go lower, you're still good to go. "
"3790900","3795480"," Bears are, our bulls are still okay if we roll over and come down like this."
"3796340","3798520"," And if this doesn't get rejected, you're going higher."
"3799100","3799340"," Make sense?"
"3800380","3805340"," Bears can take this over here though if there's any bad news and start to, if we get two rejections"
"3805340","3807460"," and come down, it's going to be a bloodbath, okay?"
"3809940","3812360"," Now, I'm going to show you, I want to show you something important here. "
"3812920","3815600"," I'm going to get rid of this, this MA here."
"3817840","3820880"," And I'm going to show you this EMA right here, okay?"
"3822980","3825120"," I'm going to show you why this is important right here, okay?"
"3825820","3827160"," It's on a daily basis right now."
"3828820","3832720"," You see this blue line right here crossing over this green line right here?"
"3832880","3838000"," As long as this blue line keeps coming up and you're a bull, you're in the safe. "
"3838720","3839620"," See that right there?"
"3842120","3847340"," This green line right here comes up here and we start selling off at any point."
"3848840","3850300"," You're looking to pick this back up."
"3851520","3853960"," It comes down here, comes back up. "
"3855020","3859700"," Any bear telling you out there that we're going down, if that happens right here, any bear tells"
"3859700","3862500"," you we're going down and this happens, they're wrong."
"3864860","3866540"," This is wrong, JPM is wrong."
"3869870","3875250"," If we get this, this happens right here, you see this big blue line come up on a daily chart"
"3875250","3875510"," right?"
"3876470","3882450"," And you see this green line coming over here and you see some nonsense like this. "
"3882630","3884890"," And this gives you time, this is what I was talking about a fin to it."
"3885430","3890210"," If we come down here, let's say we sell it right, we sell it back down right here underneath one,"
"3890390","3895470"," two, and start pumping and you start breaking like 385 in this level right here."
"3897810","3898430"," It's on. "
"3898650","3900790"," You make it go to a saying here's a trade right here for the bears."
"3901730","3903830"," And then you're the big trades down in here."
"3903950","3904770"," This is like bear town. "
"3906070","3906730"," Make sense?"
"3907090","3914390"," And I'll promise you that the options market is right now, the options market is basically bid up"
"3914390","3915930"," for up and down."
"3916270","3921590"," If you look at calls and puts like fucking, I don't know, I think we were looking yesterday before"
"3921590","3928690"," we were looking just March and May or March and April and they've got they bid up both up and"
"3928690","3929210"," down here."
"3930570","3937490"," Traders have investors have and of course the hedging that's gone on with dealers. "
"3938450","3939830"," Now I want you to see this, right?"
"3940050","3941030"," Haven't broken above previously."
"3941450","3942310"," Haven't broken above previously."
"3944630","3945790"," Failed right here, right?"
"3946210","3947750"," But this is what I really want to show you. "
"3947830","3948210"," This is the key."
"3948430","3950370"," Remember this, take a screenshot of this right here, okay?"
"3951590","3952330"," This is important."
"3953570","3956690"," I want you to take a screenshot, come back to the program, take a screenshot of that one. "
"3957890","3960650"," I want you to look at this on a weekly basis right here."
"3961470","3963110"," I want you to see this on a weekly basis."
"3963710","3964550"," Teed right off. "
"3964950","3965790"," Can this blue one?"
"3966330","3967470"," Teed right off, okay?"
"3968390","3969090"," Weekly basis."
"3969870","3972290"," I want you to see this one down here."
"3973870","3976870"," Full's winning on a monthly basis, okay?"
"3977870","3983410"," What I really want to show you is what I want to show you. "
"3985350","3986290"," Right in here."
"3987770","3989130"," You see this move right here?"
"3989970","3991170"," See that move right there?"
"3991850","3992930"," See this move right here?"
"3994990","3996430"," I don't know why we're going."
"3997310","4000170"," And I also want to show you, see how we broke out above?"
"4001330","4002270"," Or hold on. "
"4002890","4008400"," See how we, we consolidated it in here, right?"
"4009500","4009820"," Right?"
"4010380","4016200"," Slam down, broke above, came straight back down and held, off and running."
"4017560","4022660"," This could be, this was a bear trap."
"4024360","4030500"," Now there are some other instances in the past where it's been a bear in a bull trap. "
"4030980","4033840"," My point to you is don't get caught in here."
"4034060","4035560"," I don't care if you're a bull or a bear."
"4035680","4036620"," You do not get caught. "
"4037540","4042140"," If this thing comes back up here, right, closes 420 or 410 and bounces back down in here."
"4042580","4044720"," And you see this green line coming down in here?"
"4046260","4049680"," You see this blue line coming up right here, right?"
"4050280","4052380"," Hold on a second, we'll get rid of all that bullshit, do it over for you."
"4053480","4056820"," And I don't care what Elliott Waver out there is telling you, I don't care what people. "
"4057100","4059900"," And I can show you that the banks are buying."
"4060280","4061180"," I can show it to you."
"4061280","4063460"," I'm not going to stay here in this broadcast. "
"4064240","4065580"," We've got somebody that's going to be here."
"4065640","4069360"," We have a new partner coming in that's going to do all this stuff for you in recorded videos."
"4070520","4071640"," But do not get caught in here. "
"4071720","4073060"," This is the place not to get caught."
"4075160","4077980"," But if we come back down here and recheck this is my point, right?"
"4078980","4080780"," And you're a bear and you're like, oh, I sold this."
"4081080","4084340"," I want you to just take the money and run and then pick up the trade back underneath. "
"4084720","4085520"," You pick it up here."
"4085740","4086260"," Does that make sense?"
"4087100","4089100"," Somewhere in here, you pick this trade back up."
"4089280","4090480"," One trade, two trades. "
"4091400","4094080"," If you get caught in here, if you get caught, I'm going to warn you something."
"4094400","4095260"," I've been saying this, I'm going to warn you."
"4095740","4097260"," I was fucking trading this. "
"4098060","4105300"," And I watched my friends that are bears, close friends of mine, give back a million dollars right"
"4105300","4105800"," up in here."
"4107040","4108420"," Gave it back, just gone."
"4109060","4110240"," Poor traders once again. "
"4110240","4111700"," I don't want to see a bear get his money back."
"4112000","4113300"," Bears are making money all year long."
"4113880","4114720"," You keep your money. "
"4115319","4119080"," If you need to go bull or if you need to wait once a month to put your puts on"
"4119080","4122740"," and make your money for a year, that's what you do."
"4123939","4125840"," Do I think we're going all time high right now?"
"4125939","4126120"," No."
"4126479","4127800"," But I think we're going to 460 right now. "
"4127960","4128120"," No."
"4128939","4129819"," I actually don't."
"4130939","4136800"," What I think is going to happen is we've got some we've got some known ranges. "
"4144069","4145950"," We can measure and inverse head and shoulders."
"4146130","4147350"," We got the 460 right."
"4149090","4150470"," This is what I think is going to happen. "
"4150649","4152649"," If you ever going to ask Captain Jim what I think is going to happen."
"4154830","4156170"," This is what I think is going to happen."
"4160960","4161920"," I'm going to show it. "
"4161979","4162420"," Hold on."

"4182040","4183960"," This is what I'm going to show you what I think is going to happen, okay?"
"4188260","4190540"," And it says it's somewhere right in here somewhere."
"4192120","4192779"," Right in there. "
"4192859","4193040"," Hold on."
"4193520","4198860"," I've got to go part of the bat somewhere right in there."

"4209650","4213240"," Right there."
"4218880","4220520"," And I think we're going to trade this zone. "
"4220880","4223220"," And I think we're going to trade this zone until we build enough up."
"4224680","4226120"," I think we're going to trade this zone."
"4226280","4228680"," We're going to have some bad days come back down and test this stuff. "
"4230680","4231080"," Right."
"4231380","4233420"," We might have even a bloodbath down to 3200."
"4234180","4234500"," One moment. "
"4234640","4235560"," You know when you trade a range."
"4237620","4239280"," You know when you trade a range, right?"
"4239680","4242700"," That you'll have like, yeah, this is probably our range right in here."
"4243860","4246240"," And we'll have like a day we pop up and hit 460. "
"4246680","4249960"," We're probably going to have a day pop down to 3200, 2,800."
"4250920","4254200"," This is probably our range right in here to the end of 2024."
"4255400","4257000"," And you'll have one bloodbath in here. "
"4257300","4258660"," You're going to get the feds going to cut rates."
"4259620","4260740"," And that's pretty much what you're looking for."
"4261280","4262680"," In my view, that's what you're looking for. "
"4263140","4265540"," You can draw your own little like buyers are here."
"4265580","4266500"," You can do this on your own."
"4266500","4268140"," You can put a green box down here if you want. "
"4269040","4271600"," And make this like green, the darker green down below."

"4307910","4308770"," Is my ad?"
"4309130","4310170"," Actually, I don't have an ad. "
"4310390","4311290"," I probably have an ad right here."
"4311450","4312250"," I've stopped down here."
"4317310","4318070"," Somewhere in there. "
"4321890","4322470"," Missed the buy."
"4322690","4323370"," I probably would have bought that."
"4326520","4327120"," All right. "
"4327120","4330480"," I don't think I got there."
"4334300","4335440"," What do you think of that, John?"
"4336340","4337940"," Puts us right back on track, right?"
"4338700","4342320"," All that bullshit from COVID pumping the market gone."
"4343420","4347460"," Gives time to the market to take some of that sloshing money out of the market. "
"4347720","4348560"," Does that sound right to you?"
"4356010","4356550"," Hold on a second."
"4356750","4367490"," I got somebody blowing me up here in the business."

"4399110","4400250"," He's like, let's sell the market."
"4403950","4405130"," Now I don't like trading puts."
"4405450","4406450"," I'm not a put trader. "
"4409900","4411000"," There we go."
"4411740","4412320"," All right."

"4432160","4434220"," I'm trying to push Apple over right here."
"4439320","4441160"," Let's have a look at Apple and see what it's doing. "
"4441740","4443680"," Uh, dude, Apple's super, super bullish."
"4444980","4447680"," Uh, I want to see Apple go to 144."
"4449920","4451460"," 144 50 if possible. "
"4452860","4454320"," I don't know if that's going to happen."
"4454700","4454800"," 144."
"4458580","4459880"," Yeah, 144 50. "
"4459880","4461200"," Yes, right in here."
"4461820","4466240"," If we can get a Apple to come down and just cool off cool jets for just a minute."
"4470180","4471460"," Keep it right there. "
"4471880","4473620"," Now, if Apple regains, it's one minute."
"4474140","4479380"," It's, it's, uh, they get another chance to break this high above Apple needs to break right here."
"4479640","4485090"," A little yellow box right there. "
"4485230","4487810"," This would be the, this would be that we're super bullish to get above."

"4500850","4502190"," I'm going to jump into a long trade."
"4507900","4516480"," I'm looking at 406 C's and I'm just looking to break above this blue line right here."
"4522200","4526770"," I want this blue line to be held right here. "
"4527670","4530070"," I don't want to get trapped and be all bullish down here."

"4535890","4536790"," This blue line. "
"4537230","4538030"," Oh, this is where built."
"4538230","4541070"," This is where bulls get trapped and I don't want to get trapped."
"4541330","4543890"," So what I want to see is some consolidation here. "
"4544430","4547030"," I want to see this blue line turn around."

"5869580","5874780"," these fed meetings We stay in trend a day or two later So if you're a bear and you see"

"5891700","5893920"," They're probably trying to get back in a trend again."
"5894040","5899760"," That's seems like it's been happening There's an argument out there that we're going to uh decouple"
"5899760","5908040"," from from what uh The fed says we've seen that in the past In the 1950s and 60s in the"
"5908040","5913040"," 1970s we did when you heard biden speak yesterday, and I don't think this is going to stay like"
"5913040","5917900"," this I think the democrats i'm a democrat just so you know, but I think the democrats are going to"
"5917900","5925080"," lose At some point over this argument Uh because biden is basically saying to you that he wants to"
"5925080","5931960"," turn us back into the 50s and 60s And that's a sideways and up market They raise rates higher and"
"5931960","5939040"," higher and higher and higher um Everybody has a job But uh people are greedy. "
"5939340","5940280"," You need to know that people are greedy."
"5940300","5947640"," They're going to want to make money um So I guess my deposit behind that would be You you will"
"5947640","5954340"," see if we go down that path You will see the stock market decouple from whatever, uh, the fed share"
"5954340","5959620"," says And it'll just do its own thing Uh, I don't know when that'll happen you do know that if"
"5959620","5965040"," they pause rates or pull rates back We're probably going to have uh another crat not I can not"
"5965040","5968940"," crash But I will have a capitulation moment and then we'd have a new bull market."
"5969200","5976360"," I don't think timing wise we're there yet So I don't think that's going to happen until um Uh until"
"5976360","5980680"," he breaks something right unless something's broken that we just don't know about it Uh, but he is"
"5980680","5983420"," in a corner on that stuff too So he's kind of in a corner. "
"5983740","5987400"," We get the point about him being a corner is the market is going to decouple from him if he"
"5987400","5995480"," stays the course He should be aware of that Until he does cut rates Or pause rates when he does"
"5995480","6001100"," we'll have that last blast down Uh, or in my view, that's what's going to happen Uh, so I'd be"
"6001100","6006880"," looking for that sideways market and slightly up into the end of the year Um, so that's what's"
"6006880","6014260"," going into the fed share next week on thursday the second we've got claims continuing claims Uh, if"

"14531030","14536230"," We might not they might save it for monday or for tuesday Uh, but i'm taking it straight here for"
"14536230","14542070"," for next week I could about I would you know call spread right here and work well, too I just"
"14542070","14551980"," didn't do it being fucking lazy to be honest with you Um If we can't hold this and"
"14551980","14557440"," start if we don't consolidate in here, we still have a target lower I don't think that happens"
"14557440","14557620"," though. "
"14557720","14561380"," You got to understand the mechanics Let me take the market, but they're understand what's happening"
"14561380","14567220"," here Then I just got the phone with uh joe donut And I was explaining to him what should happen"
"14568520","14575380"," Um, so I'll explain this to you you most you probably know this but New traders probably don't or"
"14575380","14582220"," they don't they get it But they don't so Or like you can new old traders understand but new traders"
"14582220","14592910"," won't so So What happens is this is Um I"
"14592910","14597730"," talked to you guys about trading above 160 right you train above this number and what happens is"
"14598750","14605390"," dealers actually take the trade with you Instead of taking the opposite trade to be neutral They"
"14605390","14611730"," actually chase chase you because it's not expect an expected move And uh, they end up chasing you"
"14611730","14618090"," all the way up here And if new call buyers don't step in they cash out keep their money."
"14618270","14618390"," Okay."
"14618730","14624130"," This is I'm trying to be like simplify this for you Uh now you get some put buyers step in"
"14624130","14634230"," here Right And uh, what happens is The dealers will take the opposite side of the trade now And"
"14634230","14639890"," we'll go up and retest the highs that makes sense This is where they take the opposite side of the"
"14639890","14648730"," trade If no more call buyers step in Uh, the put buyers will have to put more money down buy"
"14648730","14656170"," more puts And we'll start heading lower Now the the one problem with all these mechanics right here"
"14656170","14666230"," is that we're coming into uh end of month And we're coming into Where banks"
"14666230","14674890"," are shorting above So if there's like a few more shorts in here Uh, or a few more retailers in"
"14674890","14680330"," here Between now and like end of month Which is Tuesday. "
"14680850","14682970"," We should squeeze up here and hit this at some point."
"14683010","14688570"," It's not guaranteed Um, and what you end up doing is you leave you end up leaving retail behind to"
"14688570","14694470"," pay up the mess Uh So so does this happen or not?"
"14694730","14700370"," Maybe maybe not Yeah, this is where you start taking profit if you want to leave some runners on or"
"14700370","14706470"," if you want to leave some stops on You want to put call spread on you can do that if"
"14706470","14713590"," you're a Longtime tesla stockholder This is not the place for you to be buying You're looking for a"
"14713590","14714330"," retest lower."
"14714690","14720890"," You're looking for a break above 196 and a hold Right, so you're just you're trying to manage it"
"14720890","14728030"," manage yourself Um as a trader Whatever happens in here Um, they can go either way, right?"
"14728390","14732090"," You start talking about you start always want to be thinking about probabilities, right?"
"14733050","14737630"," What's the problem like what's what put the more advantage you have as an investor or as a trader"
"14738290","14748960"," More probability is on your side Um the better off you are um the"
"14748960","14757810"," The The better you're always better off that way you always want like high probability trades"
"14757810","14760830"," Because even high probability trades don't go your way, right?"
"14761150","14761910"," You guys know that, right?"
"14762890","14766670"," Uh, you can take a high probability trade and it goes against you. "

"22959680","22967620"," The market rolls over I'm not buying tesla here If the market rolls over and comes down Right, I"
"22967620","22974700"," got my next buy that I can DCA into So if tesla bounces in the mark This is key for"
"22974700","22979220"," you if you're a bull or a bear in this market You probably will be able to use tesla as"
"22979220","22984460"," one of the indicators If the market is going to continue higher, you'll see a bounce here This will"
"22984460","22990380"," likely be like 380 on spy And you will see the market continue on. "
"22990600","22994720"," This is what I would add right here Now, let's say it doesn't right."
"22994900","23002940"," Let's say tesla breaks through but women Next time, okay So let's say tesla starts to break through"
"23002940","23009660"," and doesn't consolidate Right, I'm going to have a stop loss for adding to this position Right, we"
"23009660","23014100"," have a stop loss over here And it actually just starts to to break through, right?"
"23014640","23018460"," So it comes down here Break through and starts the bloodbath down, right?"
"23019200","23021060"," I got my I'm gonna cut my losses here."
"23021320","23026520"," Keep these down here Put anything that I just bought them and to get rid of them Keep my keep"
"23026520","23030700"," my original buying over here And I'm going to look for a new low at 95 bucks and I'm going"
"23030700","23035920"," to dca here I'm going to dca at 65 And I'm going to dca at 40 or whatever I'm going"
"23035920","23041240"," to build my position so that as we make our way up here or down here That I can stay"
"23041240","23047000"," long tesla now some of you guys out there Uh that aren't aren't or don't want to manage this shit"
"23047000","23051480"," You just take profit here You can do that Right, if you're if you own the underlying if you're a"
"23051480","23057480"," call or as an option buyer You can't buy calls here Right, there's not enough room here for you to"
"23057480","23066860"," buy calls You're actually looking to deleverage yourself And wait for either a retest here Or We"
"23066860","23069000"," break above and start making new highs. "
"23069000","23075560"," This is where you buy calls on tesla right here Right here With stop losses on it Does that make"
"23075560","23075800"," sense?"
"23076580","23080520"," And if we if you have your stops here and we break through those stops you haven't blown up your"
"23080520","23087900"," account Right, and then you're going to look for the next spot Probably a test of uh 100 And then"
"23087900","23093000"," you'll have another test of uh 95 I think you'll tap down to five And I think down here like"
"23093000","23093960"," 65 is your next one."
"23094060","23094520"," Does that make sense?"
"23094960","23101160"," So you should be you should be Structuring your trades if you're in in calls You should be deciding"
"23101160","23106080"," if you're just going to take the money and run on the editor line You should be deciding when you"
"23106080","23114460"," should be buying Uh Adding to your position when I see bulls and they're like Uh, I'm buying right"
"23114460","23114760"," here."
"23114960","23120080"," I'm like that's because they were fucking scared down here That makes sense So if you're a true"
"23120080","23128920"," bull you should be buying that at the bottom right And then you take some off Or you hold But"
"23128920","23135820"," you don't buy and then you start looking to buy down here Or you buy above here So you bought"
"23135820","23138100"," this dip you bought this dip Does that make sense?"
"23138360","23142580"," You bought this dip and you're constantly going up and buying the dip as you ride higher and higher"
"23142580","23144180"," and higher Does that make sense?"
"23144800","23154670"," Hopefully it does You guys understand what that is You"

"24034580","24046870"," away think happens Uh Uh Hold on You're"
"24046870","24050770"," a bull you're waiting to buy this right if you're a bear you're looking to sell this and you can"
"24050770","24060470"," sell this probably right now Uh bulls just need to hold on here Right Get the rest of earnings out"
"24060470","24064550"," of the way tag 420 And then we make our way down into uh march."
"24064970","24068270"," Here's march 17 And there's your 360. "
"24068710","24069630"," Yep, that's what I think."
"24069890","24079390"," Okay, so this is what I think right here um Tag 420 Get your earnings out of the way."
"24080130","24086690"," There's your march 17th Uh, you might bloodbath it down from there march 17th is right here"
"24086690","24092830"," somewhere in here And this is a question mark for me If we bloodbath on march 17th and go down"
"24092830","24098770"," to 360 If we have bad news in here or something bad news if we don't get a bloodbath down"
"24098770","24106550"," below 360 That's the jpm pen Uh Then we're gonna head back up and try to tag uh probably for"
"24107750","24113770"," 60 by and by summertime We'll actually probably go sideways in here and then attempt to go to 460"
"24113770","24117130"," in q2 of june So there you go. "
"24117150","24118170"," There's my take right there."
"24118630","24124370"," That's my path On path it's right there And i'll leave this up."
"24124530","24136930"," You can just take snapshot of it Um Yep, and you'll see 460 by summertime Makes"
"24136930","24146680"," sense Yeah, this is This is a fairly good"
"24148000","24153140"," Fairly good, but there are there's some cool stuff here If you start breaking down, this is the"
"24153140","24158040"," thing about this chart is Uh, if we just start selling here, you don't really have to worry about"
"24158040","24163160"," it because if you're a bear Let's say you're a bull and you miss all this nonsense Right, we start"
"24163160","24170700"," breaking this shit like early like this week next week Uh, we're probably going down to like 3060"
"24170700","24171900"," by the end of the end of the quarter. "
