"110920","117800"," I mean, it just shows, it just totally shows the clown show, right?"
"118180","118440"," It does. "
"119120","119840"," Even C."
"119900","121200"," NBC was a clown show about it."

"127300","127860"," Good morning, Josh?"
"128080","128300"," Good morning."
"129039","129780"," Let's talk about that."
"130400","132460"," We're at an interesting moment in the market right now. "
"133340","138080"," So what I'm going to do is, before we get started here, I'm going to bring something up behind the"
"138080","139300"," screen that you're looking at right now."
"139460","140000"," Just give me a second."
"140640","141920"," So I'm going to get everybody in the room real quick. "
"143700","144440"," E.V. Good to see you."
"145280","149920"," My Eskimo brother at HP, Faison Aussie, Doug Sofa."
"150320","151440"," Christopher, you're a boomer. "
"151520","151800"," Good morning."
"151940","152260"," How are you?"
"152800","153780"," Dylan, good morning."
"153900","154180"," How are you?"
"154800","156700"," So we're going to give you a second here. "
"156800","160820"," I'm going to do something here this morning."
"163400","165660"," We're at an interesting place in the market this morning."
"166060","167940"," First off, the jobs numbers, right?"
"169160","169700"," It's hilarious. "
"170160","172540"," There were articles across the country yesterday."
"174420","179040"," Stating the jobs numbers are going to be awful this morning."
"179840","181720"," And, you know, would there be doom and gloom over it?"
"181820","184280"," You can see that the jobs numbers weren't actually that bad. "
"185840","186860"," They were actually good."
"187080","192300"," They were better than what was expected in terms of, you know, how bad they were going to be."
"192740","194300"," Anyways, it's a whole, all a disaster. "
"194920","201240"," The takeaway, though, is that it's important because there are other markets that rely upon making"
"201240","202520"," money off of the market."
"202520","207720"," The jobs numbers, particularly currencies, gold, metals, things like that."
"208940","213740"," So you give that time to the jobs numbers, those people. "
"213860","219120"," But I have something interesting I want to show you this morning about the market they're waking up"
"219120","219300"," to."
"220800","223260"," And we're going to take a look at it real quick here."
"224820","231260"," Because it's a, it's, it's not an inflection point. "
"231260","234400"," It's something a key that I want you guys to see."
"234820","235360"," That's important."
"235560","236500"," So we're going to switch over here. "
"237140","239060"," So you can go straight back to the live stream."
"239940","240380"," Okay."
"241300","241740"," Perfect. "
"244100","245540"," There will play every day of this morning."
"246080","247900"," And this is important information for you for this morning."
"248240","248960"," Today's Friday. "
"249560","252140"," Typically the trading is done and Friday is done."
"252500","252700"," Not always."
"253040","257760"," Actually recently, Fridays have been very wild. "
"258940","263440"," Fridays are known in the past to be the day where you get your trades done."
"263820","267040"," You wrap up your trades by not 10 30 in the morning."
"268380","273020"," And then people revenge trade are known for revenge trading the rest of Friday. "
"273820","276740"," You can end up losing a lot of money too in that time frame."
"277180","279780"," And they tend to be quieter in the past, right?"
"280040","283200"," Then we usually have a VIX cross or something into the end of the day."
"284400","285840"," Not really the best day to be trading. "
"286580","287840"," Or even investing for that."
"287960","289680"," Or I guess in the morning it's good usually."
"289860","291400"," But recently they've been huge days. "
"292540","294540"," So I can't say that that applies right now."
"295000","298700"," But what I want to talk to you about though is I'm tired this morning."
"298920","301040"," I noticed the guys on CNBC this morning were tired too. "
"301200","304240"," I'm tired because the trading has been so intense."
"305580","306740"," You all know this, right?"
"307920","311440"," But what's most interesting is that we just went through the month of January, right?"
"311920","313300"," And I'm going to show you a few things."
"313620","315160"," I'm going to show you something bigger later. "
"315160","316740"," But a smaller time frame."
"317060","318200"," Let's follow my cursor here, right?"
"318940","321540"," And this is a January 4th right here, right?"
"322640","327020"," You can see how we traded all this down to doom and gloom down to 420."
"328640","329520"," This was brutal. "
"330220","336080"," Trading this, no matter which side you were on, you can't say this that I remember these weeks I"
"336080","337400"," was worn out each week with you."
"337560","338620"," By Friday I was done."
"339420","340020"," I was done. "
"341000","341460"," Very intense."
"342440","343580"," Didn't matter if you're a bull bear."
"343580","346740"," Didn't matter if you were taking shorts here, right?"
"346900","347480"," Or longs. "
"347820","348980"," These are all huge rips."
"349120","349880"," We traded all this down."
"349980","350720"," We traded this up. "
"350800","351560"," We traded this down."
"352160","353220"," This was insane, right?"
"353420","354620"," This is all insane in here too."
"354780","355660"," All of these moves are insane. "
"356420","360660"," But the key point that I want to talk to you about right here is a couple of things."
"360960","363560"," I want to show you where it is."
"364140","364860"," Where can I do this?"
"366440","369420"," What I want to show you guys is..."
"369420","373520"," Let's forget where this thing is. "
"373660","375000"," I think it's this one."
"375600","377620"," I think it's the bar pattern."
"378320","379180"," You'll be wrong here. "
"379760","380140"," Let's see."
"381780","382480"," That's this one."
"382640","382780"," Nope. "
"384200","391520"," I want to show you guys something here."
"392640","395640"," I think it's going to be kind of weird trying to do a bar pattern here, but we're going to"
"395640","396220"," see if we can."
"396860","397300"," Right here. "
"397760","398000"," Okay."
"400680","401400"," Is that working?"
"403420","405440"," Now do you see this big move down that we have right here?"
"406880","408080"," We're just down here to 420."
"409560","414520"," I want to know if you can piece anything together or out of that. "
"415920","419740"," The point that I'm going to try to make to you right now at this point is do you see"
"419740","421160"," this quick bar pattern right here?"
"423360","426900"," We are once again starting that again for where we are this morning."
"428040","428280"," Okay."
"429420","429860"," Now. "
"431680","432960"," What does that mean?"
"433700","437060"," Does that mean we get another month of this?"
"439060","444160"," Now yesterday it looked manufactured to me to buy a dip."
"444900","451160"," It seemed like the sell off from bad Amazon earnings started the day before between Wednesday and"
"451160","452880"," Thursday, continued into the end of Thursday."
"453440","455420"," There was a chance for Amazon to be bought by banks. "
"455840","457940"," It was also a chance for banks to buy Facebook."
"457940","461820"," Remember these are the companies that are holding up the indexes."
"462180","463000"," They're holding up the NASDAQ. "
"463120","464180"," They're holding up the SMP 500."
"465400","473300"," And they're literally dropping them one by one to get buy-ins and slowly dropping the indexes as we"
"473300","473760"," go along."
"476380","478260"," Now let's forget about Friday, right?"
"478720","480580"," Friday is a day where you can make the wrong move. "
"481140","482220"," But just let's look right here."
"482320","489340"," This right here is showing you that we could be starting another cycle down from here, okay?"
"490440","491640"," We're not even into it yet."
"491920","494500"," We're in the beginning stage of it this morning. "
"495080","496500"," This is all Wednesday, Thursday."
"497180","498960"," We call this Wednesday, Thursday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday."
"499100","499700"," What if you don't call it here?"
"499880","501720"," We're not even there yet. "
"503260","506660"," And look at how the rest of the week could, you know, continue."
"508040","508580"," Next week, let's say."
"510540","511919"," I'm only to be aware of this. "
"512159","515039"," This could be our next month right here, the month of February."
"517059","518020"," This could be the start."
"518200","519460"," You know what this reminds me of?"
"519580","526860"," When we're in a bullish context, the last two years, we would start these cycles. "
"527540","529180"," We hit a bottom and move up for a month, right?"
"529660","531580"," It was like cyclically you knew when to sell the market."
"531700","532620"," You knew when to buy the market."
"533020","535620"," And this looks like we're starting this all over again, okay?"
"536160","541820"," So if you thought last month was wild, there's a chance that this month could be just as wild. "
"542260","544960"," Now there's some key points for where we are this morning."
"544960","545280"," Okay."
"547100","548680"," I'm going to get rid of this if I can. "
"548840","550360"," I don't know if I can get rid of this real quick, but."
"551720","552540"," I'll get rid of that."
"555540","560460"," And that's the piece that when you're looking at just this chart, if you weren't paying attention"
"560460","565400"," to everything back here, and you were just looking at this right here, what is this setting up?"
"565780","567380"," It's setting up another megaphone. "
"567900","568360"," Okay."
"569760","577920"," And this megaphone, if it continues down, could show us much lower numbers than 420, talking like"
"577920","581460"," 413, 409, maybe lower."
"582200","585420"," If you had a capitulation move in the market, could go lower. "
"587450","589970"," Now, I'm going to give the bulls one more chance here."
"590190","592630"," This is the major resistance line, right?"
"592770","594130"," We know about this major resistance."
"594370","595930"," We were up here, right?"
"596150","600870"," On the second, we got up here and we talked about they have to get over this line, jump over"
"600870","603550"," at trade sideways and move higher, that would show the recovery. "
"604250","606090"," We know that below here is bearish."
"606090","610670"," We know we're neutral if we jump over and start to consolidate and then make a move higher."
"611370","612730"," We knew that we rejected here. "
"613410","617070"," I'm going to give it the chance to the bulls to make one more attempt to go up here."
"617810","619810"," And it wouldn't surprise me to see us go back up here."
"623860","624260"," Sorry. "
"625000","627740"," It wouldn't surprise me to see us go back up here."
"627820","632380"," At least once or twice more, even if we head down into February 18th."
"633640","640240"," But this is, it's not an inflection point, but it is a moment where, you know, you're always asked,"
"640300","643920"," or you guys, a lot of guys out there asking me, well, how do I trade farther out than one"
"643920","646060"," week, one month, two months, three months?"
"648260","649380"," This is it right here. "
"650460","653320"," This is a plan for the next month, the month of February."
"654320","661340"," Then you guys often ask me, you know, how do you have longs and shorts at the same time?"
"661700","665240"," Here's a prime example of where we are just today on a Friday."
"666980","670240"," How you can set yourself up with some put spreads. "
"673570","676830"," And you just play the rips with outside the money calls."
"676850","678490"," This is the exact same thing."
"679570","683590"," You can just do it in the money put spread right here today. "
"684410","688790"," Literally, we could trade sideways today, put it in the money, put spread on for the month of"
"688790","689150"," February."
"690350","693590"," Remember, we traded this down into the 24th of January."
"695350","696270"," Just something in the money. "
"697590","698790"," You could do it in the money one."
"698910","704310"," You could do one that's down at 4.13. Let me get like four, I don't know, 420, let's say."
"706330","709050"," Later in the month, like the 18th or even the week after the 18th of 420. "
"709610","711270"," You had two of them, right?"
"711470","714830"," By multiples, however much money you want to spend on those, right?"
"715490","718890"," You cut them loose, though, if we start to trade higher here, we start to break through."
"720310","722490"," And let's say by a put spread, let's say it's two bucks."
"722490","727370"," And you're just buying 10 cent calls for all this in case we move higher here. "
"727890","731510"," If you're a bull and you're like, well, I've got the bullish perspective."
"731710","733330"," We're not starting this new megaphone down."
"734350","734870"," Sure. "
"735350","739150"," Then load up on your monthlies and your three month calls here."
"739890","742270"," And then make sure you're buying some cheap."
"743490","746550"," Make sure you're buying some 10 cent puts. "
"747710","750510"," The expire down here on the 18th of the week after."
"751010","751870"," I like 410."
"752870","754430"," You actually buy them a month out. "
"755130","757070"," Even cheaper or lower."
"757750","761470"," So that when we're right down here, you know, how we sell and get down here and you sell those"
"761470","762710"," puts, gets sold down here."
"764170","768770"," You could sell those puts, those deep, deep, like 390 360 puts to some. "
"769270","771870"," It wouldn't go 360, but you need to go like 400 or something."
"772790","773490"," Buy some 400 puts."
"773710","775670"," They're like a month and a half out one month out. "
"776550","778270"," Then some, some, some schmuck down here."
"779450","780150"," So we're here."
"780270","780690"," It tastes Friday. "
"781710","784470"," I think you guys are thinking I was going to talk about something different this morning."
"785230","790250"," But right now, what I'm talking to you about right now is here you go."
"790450","791850"," You want to know where a new cycle is?"
"791950","792550"," We're right in it. "
"793930","795050"," We're right in it this morning."
"796390","797470"," We could trade up from here."
"798490","798850"," Right?"
"798990","800470"," We could trade down from here for an entire month. "
"801170","804170"," So this would be an inflection point for you as a trader, as an investor."
"804170","808910"," Especially if you're in another country and you can only make certain trades, right?"
"810050","812950"," This is going to start another cycle for the next month."
"813050","815650"," That's either down or we're going to break. "
"815850","818610"," We're going to work above and we're going to break higher."
"819270","824690"," Now, I'll tell you, I'm so tired today, this Friday morning, that just considering that we could"
"824690","827850"," trade down here for the next month, I'm going to want to take the entire day off."
"828770","833670"," We want to set some puts, but it's, you know, I'm going to buy some outside the money calls and"
"833670","837970"," call it a day, and I'll check back in on Monday to see which direction the market's going to take. "
"838790","840730"," Because this is a lot of work for us this month."
"841170","845030"," If we have to trade this down for an entire month in the month of February, it's going to be"
"845030","845270"," brutal."
"846330","847310"," And I'll tell you what else. "
"847970","850870"," A lot of people didn't know about this one up here being what it was, right?"
"852110","854490"," Back here in January, I couldn't identify this."
"854910","856570"," So we're identifying it right now."
"858090","859890"," It's proving itself this morning. "
"861930","864970"," It's setting up the market again for another month, just like January."
"866190","871670"," That doesn't mean we can't trade above, break through this downward resistance channel."
"872370","879550"," It doesn't mean we can't go higher, but I think today is a perfect day if you're an investor, if"
"879550","886650"," you're a trader, to take a moment today and plan out the rest of January. "
"888270","894230"," It doesn't matter if you have a bullish or a bearish context, but just plan out what you think you"
"894230","897150"," need to do to cover or move all the way down here."
"897950","903530"," Let's call it 4.15. That doesn't mean you get like a 4.15 put spread."
"904190","905130"," You want a little bit higher, right?"
"906010","907550"," You want like 4.20, 4.22?"
"907890","911110"," You get another one that's right in the money right here, right?"
"911110","915850"," And then you can day trade this up with a guy I already told you guys how to do this,"
"915890","916050"," right?"
"917010","920530"," I would talk about this ad nauseam, but I don't think we're trading sideways. "
"921570","926510"," I guess there's a third option we trade sideways, but it ain't looking like it to me, right?"
"926730","930010"," It's walking, quacking, talking like a duck to me right now."
"930210","934530"," And this is talking to me like, yeah, we can trade sideways over here for into next week and then"
"934530","935550"," start making our way down."
"936210","938790"," We can trade sideways this way, you're going to hear bulls there, we're going up. "
"938790","939490"," It doesn't really matter."
"939490","942990"," If you use a trader as an investor, I'm giving you a month plan right here."
"943350","950170"," A month plan is that we're going to trade down to 4.13. And if we trade higher, so you"
"950170","951730"," need to put some protection on for that at minimum. "
"952470","956110"," And even if we trade higher, you can cut these loose, right?"
"956170","960450"," Let's say you have some, and then spend the money puts spreads here, expiring a month away, you can"
"960450","964190"," still cut this stuff loose if we break above and start working our way up."
"964970","968350"," And you'll make money anyways on the outside of the money stuff that you're buying heading this"
"968350","968510"," way."
"968510","970330"," So, here you go. "
"971250","977990"," The complaint oftentimes is, you know, you don't, you're not trading or we know longer than 5"
"977990","978550"," minutes or whatever."
"978810","980550"," But here's the setup, it's right here."
"981310","984870"," It's for you to decide where you think we're going, but it doesn't really matter where we go. "
"985470","990010"," But more matters more is that you can develop a plan to trade this down or up."
"991710","992990"," Does that make sense to everybody?"
"994670","995670"," Just check in real quick."
"995970","997170"," Does everybody watch this from the beginning?"
"997170","999290"," If you have not, it's 914. "
"999610","1004810"," If you have not watched this program yet from the beginning, just stop and go back and start at the"
"1004810","1005070"," beginning."
"1006030","1011370"," This is the biggest thing you need to hear for the rest of your week to consume."
"1012030","1018890"," There's nothing else that you need to listen to from anyone on the internet about the market than"
"1018890","1020710"," what I just talked about the last 10 minutes. "
"1021850","1023829"," Not the highs every morning, you'll get more than everybody."
"1023829","1025690"," By the way, I hope you all had a great week this week."
"1026069","1027589"," I hope nobody's gotten blown out this morning. "
"1029230","1034349"," Go back and listen to what I just discussed about all this structure here."
"1035550","1038710"," That's what's my plan for this morning."
"1038869","1039950"," Let me go down here and see if you guys are thinking. "
"1044880","1046000"," Definitely like lunch today."
"1047099","1050340"," I haven't even, you know, I've had a few drinks this week, but I haven't gotten my drink."
"1050520","1051240"," I haven't gotten a drink. "
"1052880","1058560"," So my day today, I think, is going to be planning what my day this week is going to be"
"1058560","1060940"," planning this structure out, right?"
"1061220","1062500"," How do I account for this structure?"
"1065150","1065590"," Okay."
"1066390","1069770"," You're going to hear people talk about how like we're going to trade down through here bounce off"
"1069770","1072070"," this megaphone and we'll work our way up higher."
"1072710","1074190"," I would not be planning for that. "
"1075930","1078790"," This structure is setting up for a move lower."
"1079070","1081370"," Yes, there is some major resistance here."
"1081790","1084190"," We might stay in this megaphone here and trade higher. "
"1085710","1095530"," But I'll tell you what, this here, this is reminding me, this here is looking a hell of a"
"1095530","1098450"," lot like this is down here."
"1099090","1100530"," And down to these lower 400s."
"1100690","1101230"," It would make sense. "
"1101390","1105810"," We've got some other things you have to think about, right?"
"1105810","1113110"," If you think about February Olympics, think about rates, right?"
"1113410","1118450"," If you think about consumer spending, think about how do we have any more good news coming out?"
"1118690","1123370"," If you think about the companies that haven't taken profit off of yet, we do stuff companies like"
"1123370","1125770"," Snow and we've got some other companies that haven't reported yet."
"1126290","1126930"," Some big tech companies."
"1127770","1129290"," The thing that stuff is over over here. "
"1130090","1134450"," Another key point would be that smaller companies are missing on their earnings."
"1134450","1136570"," We have a lot of misses and small caps."
"1137270","1142270"," So all that flow we saw yesterday in IWM is probably related to the expectation that small mid caps"
"1142270","1145770"," did not do well and do not expect to do well. "
"1146150","1149890"," We've got a ton of speculative growth companies are going to start reporting."
"1152410","1156590"," And we talked, we talked all the time right now as we said, where can I expect companies coming"
"1156590","1163670"," into this ER season to have a plan to have spent their time and money wisely the last two years."
"1163670","1166110"," You saw a snap finally turn a profit. "
"1166830","1168230"," And that's really the chopping block."
"1168470","1170950"," You can't prove that you can survive the next couple of years."
"1171510","1178850"," You're going to get whacked coming up in the next couple of weeks rest of the ER season. "
"1179690","1180970"," So just look at this."
"1181230","1186090"," Take a broader view of the market right now and start to think about no matter where we trade in"
"1186090","1191250"," this zone right here, whether we trade up today and sideways, whether we dip down and trade back"
"1191250","1191430"," up."
"1191550","1191890"," Doesn't matter. "
"1191890","1195850"," Look further down to like 415, 420."
"1196590","1197210"," It's called 420."
"1198990","1200950"," Even if we trade down to 390, it doesn't matter. "
"1201350","1203670"," Look at like 420 as a price target below."
"1204850","1208250"," And then anytime we rip up here, you can leave those put spreads on."
"1208690","1210650"," You don't lose the value if you keep trading down here. "
"1211990","1215390"," You can take profit every time we trade down here and reset them again if we trade higher."
"1215390","1219150"," You sound profit, even if it's 20%, 50%, whatever."
"1219930","1221610"," Just puts are expensive, right?"
"1222030","1224910"," Or buy yourself some puts that are like way out of the money. "
"1225210","1226190"," Yeah, do a mix of them."
"1226270","1226630"," Do a blend."
"1227470","1227870"," Mulange. "
"1228770","1230090"," Buy some put spreads on the money."
"1230810","1232290"," Buy some put spreads that are way out of money."
"1233150","1238550"," Add in some way OTM puts way down here at like 400 like a month out. "
"1239450","1244870"," And every time you go up, right, take some profit on that stuff as we go down and add yourself."
"1244870","1247370"," OTM calls as we trade higher."
"1249310","1250370"," That makes sense to everybody. "
"1254320","1256060"," I'm warning you all of you right now, okay?"
"1256660","1257720"," I'm going to warn all of you right now."
"1257760","1259260"," You got your month plan for me."
"1260680","1261880"," Don't come back in a month. "
"1262720","1265900"," If we're burning at 413 and be like, why didn't do this?"
"1266420","1267120"," And I didn't do that."
"1267600","1270340"," Don't come back in a month and say it didn't take profit either, right?"
"1270780","1274620"," And even if we trade higher here, you guys have to say if you guys buy all the stuff now,"
"1274940","1275200"," right?"
"1276320","1279460"," If you guys are, you know, or now or tomorrow."
"1279500","1283060"," If we even if we trade higher today and you buy today to wait for another rip higher to get"
"1283060","1284720"," some more of this stuff, it doesn't matter. "
"1285080","1286440"," It doesn't matter if you wait like a week or so."
"1286720","1290080"," My point to you is that this is the time for you to be planning."
"1290420","1292040"," I promise you or move down. "
"1292540","1301500"," And I promise you, if we trade way higher, that you'll pay for that put protection tenfold."
"1302400","1305500"," Even if it never prints, if we trade higher."
"1306740","1307180"," Okay?"
"1309320","1310340"," You guys all understand?"
"1312220","1313880"," Please tell me to understand out there. "
"1314140","1318360"," If you're just tuning in, you haven't tuned in this broadcast since the start of this morning, I'm"
"1318360","1320320"," going to beg you to go back to the beginning."
"1321040","1325860"," Now, one last thing I want to show you is this before we get to the day ahead of us."
"1326900","1329460"," And that is this right here. "
"1329960","1330280"," Okay?"
"1333690","1337950"," And we're going to get rid of that real quick for the trash bros so you can see it."
"1338690","1339570"," You see that right there?"
"1339690","1340710"," This is what people are talking about."
"1340990","1341910"," The bear is talking about it. "
"1341990","1344090"," I'm not saying this is going to happen, but there's your left shoulder."
"1344730","1345510"," There's your right shoulder."
"1347880","1351520"," And you already got your right shoulder setting up over here. "
"1353140","1354240"," Well, you guys will see that, okay?"
"1354340","1355580"," So that's the bearish take."
"1358140","1360300"," I don't know why these things get all wonked out or whatever."
"1361580","1362960"," Well, you guys will see that, okay?"
"1363960","1365320"," This is the bearish take. "
"1365840","1370460"," Even if you're a bull and you get over this, you still need to get back into our channel."
"1371020","1373100"," This is the channel from the 2020 and 2021."
"1373660","1375580"," This is the deepest one I could draw. "
"1376040","1379520"," This is like where the bulls say we're still in the channel, right?"
"1379780","1381480"," You've got pretty much, they're probably, they're there."
"1381680","1382120"," I shouldn't say that."
"1382240","1382660"," All right. "
"1382940","1383260"," Yeah, right."
"1383420","1387480"," We've got three layers basically to the channel we've had for two years."
"1388480","1389240"," So this is it. "
"1389360","1390200"," We're not even there yet, right?"
"1390380","1391560"," We got a ton of work to do to get up there."
"1393100","1394780"," I'm not saying we won't get up there."
"1394820","1395360"," We won't trade higher. "
"1395360","1397640"," I'm not saying we're not going all time high as I'm saying to you."
"1398200","1402100"," They were setting up for another move down just like we did here, okay?"
"1402720","1405320"," And if you get that another right shoulder over here, right?"
"1406600","1407940"," It's going to get messy."
"1408400","1409940"," Don't get caught with your pants down on this. "
"1415880","1420840"," You guys all, you guys all getting this and please, please, please, no matter what you do this"
"1420840","1421080"," morning."
"1421980","1425200"," If you're just joining right now, please just go back on the video."
"1425200","1426840"," You can just go on. "
"1427080","1431280"," By the way, you can just scroll back to the beginning, skip all the introductions and stuff, skip"
"1431280","1435220"," the talk or the talk and then right when we're looking at this chart, just getting this chart,"
"1435800","1436380"," start paying attention."
"1437400","1442780"," Because I get oftentimes what some of the complaints that I get here have to do specifically with,"
"1444220","1445880"," you know, no large game plan."
"1446440","1447120"," We're in a new month. "
"1448000","1449840"," And we had all this wild in this past couple of days."
"1450360","1452560"," And things could get wilder this month."
"1452560","1453060"," Right?"
"1453140","1454000"," Volatility could increase. "
"1454740","1457840"," This also lends the question of what happens in March, right?"
"1457860","1459360"," We're not even in March yet at this point."
"1460140","1461800"," And we're going to end up closing this week red."
"1462320","1463620"," So we had a red month last month. "
"1464120","1470980"," We're closing the first week of February red unless we trade, you know, monster moves today, right?"
"1471880","1474020"," So just start to have context where we are."
"1474840","1479600"," Have a plan for what's starting to set up, even if it doesn't come to fruition."
"1479600","1482440"," Just be just that's the pattern recognition, right?"
"1482560","1483420"," That's where you're sitting there going. "
"1483720","1484160"," Okay."
"1484900","1486500"," This is starting to set up here."
"1486880","1489740"," Remember that when we first traded down here, right?"
"1490420","1493240"," Or when we traded down here to like the 50s, right?"
"1493400","1494460"," I think this is the 50s here. "
"1494800","1496260"," Everyone said we ain't going any lower."
"1497440","1499480"," Even the bears were like only going to here."
"1500360","1500800"," Right?"
"1501860","1504940"," So just be a prepared for it. "
"1504960","1505080"," Okay."
"1506020","1507880"," See how big this move is right here."
"1507880","1509840"," Let's see how big this move could not. "
"1509940","1510980"," I don't think we're doing this move again."
"1511400","1512360"," Let's just pretend."
"1512900","1513340"," We did. "
"1513580","1515260"," I want to know if you're if you're a."
"1516120","1516760"," If you're a."
"1519240","1520380"," I do this whole time move."
"1524140","1525140"," Like let's just pretend."
"1525740","1526980"," This is bear porn for the bears. "
"1527220","1527460"," Your bears."
"1527720","1528700"," Your bears want to see some ugliness."
"1531890","1533410"," Let's just pretend we did this again. "
"1534430","1535710"," I'm not saying we're doing this again."
"1538210","1538910"," Look at that."
"1538910","1545230"," I mean, look at that right there. "
"1546270","1547470"," Look at how that sets up."
"1548550","1549870"," You see how that sets up."
"1552570","1554530"," So are you prepared as a bull?"
"1554890","1557330"," Could you handle us making a move down to 3989?"
"1557870","1559650"," I want to know if you can if you can. "
"1559990","1561450"," I want to know if you're the protection to do that."
"1562650","1563690"," The other thing you could do too."
"1563790","1568530"," I guess option forward be that if you're an investor and you just don't want to deal with this"
"1568530","1568930"," bullshit. "
"1569170","1569610"," You just wait."
"1570590","1572310"," You wait for a confirmation move higher."
"1572310","1574290"," You miss all this like extra juice. "
"1574750","1576550"," You're right back on track to what we had in the future."
"1577970","1578350"," Right."
"1579030","1579990"," You're one of those bulls. "
"1580250","1581410"," It's like, hey, we're going north."
"1582330","1584090"," We're going to crank back and we're going to go through the moon."
"1584390","1584610"," Sure. "
"1584750","1585550"," You don't need all this."
"1586110","1586710"," You are the game."
"1587090","1587870"," All this back here. "
"1588270","1589430"," You're making tons of money again."
"1590450","1592790"," I mean, after a month or two, it ain't going to matter, right?"
"1593150","1596250"," You just wait for us straight back up above and start hauling us higher."
"1597610","1600110"," Otherwise, there is some danger here. "
"1600110","1604750"," So you could just buy some March 18th and the money puts reds."
"1604770","1605710"," You don't make them February 18th."
"1605710","1606490"," You can March 18th. "
"1607630","1608570"," That's where it takes us to."
"1608630","1610670"," Did you guys see where that takes us to that little structure there?"
"1611850","1614250"," Oh, that takes us to February 28th, I think."
"1617230","1618110"," I don't understand yet. "
"1628210","1628870"," So that's it."
"1628970","1629550"," That's all I've got for you."
"1629590","1630890"," We're going to both open the market this morning. "
"1631050","1632550"," We're green right now heading into the open."
"1633490","1634610"," It's kind of funny right now."
"1634670","1639570"," I'm wondering how the market makers, the dealers are kind of fucking everybody this morning. "
"1641210","1643310"," Your puts aren't printing, right?"
"1643990","1649310"," And what's funny about this morning is how is Amazon up like to 300 points."
"1649350","1650990"," You have to spies down, right?"
"1651410","1652150"," It was kind of hilarious."
"1652650","1654670"," You've got all of tech up right now in text. "
"1655190","1655770"," It's OK."
"1655950","1658450"," It's a 22%, but it should be a monster."
"1658830","1664250"," So this makes me think that the dealers, market makers, they're going to do a wash and everything"
"1664250","1665510"," as we open the market here. "
"1666770","1668090"," That's their plan to me."
"1669270","1675990"," And so if that's their plan to me, then I think that today's a day for you to just start"
"1675990","1677130"," to think about positioning."
"1677690","1678810"," Pay yourself a piece of paper and pen. "
"1679370","1681530"," Get out options, profit calculator."
"1682530","1684830"," Talk with your battle buddies."
"1685030","1685950"," That's what we call them in the army, right?"
"1686110","1686570"," Your battle buddies. "
"1686930","1688090"," Talk to people you trade with."
"1688730","1690170"," Be like, what's your plan for this month?"
"1690830","1691290"," What do you think?"
"1691650","1692090"," Captain's type."
"1692210","1692530"," Is he crazy?"
"1693410","1695310"," And this doesn't mean that I'm bearish. "
"1695310","1697950"," It means, you know, even if we trade higher, right?"
"1698130","1701230"," Have that protection on because of where we are."
"1701890","1702770"," Contextually in the market."
"1703470","1704670"," You can lose that money. "
"1705650","1705870"," Right?"
"1706090","1707870"," And still trade higher from here."
"1708930","1712010"," And break out of a, you know, break higher and keep trucking along."
"1713010","1714630"," But don't get caught with your pants down. "
"1716390","1717230"," In this month."
"1717410","1718870"," Don't get caught coming back here."
"1719110","1722330"," You know, don't come back here in February 18 and be like. "
"1724050","1726570"," You know, don't come back here in February 30th."
"1727890","1731390"," You know, we're, we're, we're, we're trading down in the, you know, low 400s."
"1733270","1734150"," Be like, I'm dead. "
"1734290","1736410"," In fact, you have to get a job of Wendy's."
"1737890","1740150"," They provided knee pads up by the back dumpster."
"1740910","1742070"," You guys don't want to be doing that. "
"1743750","1746190"," And when you guys, you guys will know when we're."
"1746810","1748690"," Where we're bullish or we're not bullish, right?"
"1748810","1751750"," You guys can sit back and trade comfortably as a bull."
"1754130","1755710"," And trade this higher, not even care. "
"1758850","1762250"," Because you know that you have protection in case we do trade lower."
"1770840","1771280"," Yeah."
"1771520","1773020"," So it's all suspect this morning. "
"1773300","1773520"," Yes."
"1773860","1774500"," Yesterday was all suspect."
"1774840","1777360"," And I think their plan still includes more of this bullshit. "
"1778560","1780120"," It's the dismantling of the market."
"1780780","1782300"," And buying in where they want to."
"1782440","1783080"," It wouldn't shock me. "
"1783320","1786320"," I wanted to tell you guys something this morning would not shock me, right?"
"1786800","1787540"," Hold on."
"1787540","1788620"," I got some."
"1788940","1789320"," I got some. "
"1789880","1791720"," I went back and bought more calls yesterday."
"1795000","1796000"," I sold calls."
"1796380","1798520"," We don't have like we don't have what 50 points. "
"1799220","1800240"," I sold that shit."
"1800920","1801460"," I took profit."
"1801900","1805220"," Then I rebot again about some more for 60s. "
"1806560","1809220"," For I think 14 cents or something."
"1809520","1810120"," 15 cents."
"1812040","1813960"," We'll see what those are doing today. "
"1815600","1816480"," Ugly those are going to be."
"1817740","1820700"," I'm going to take a break here for a couple minutes."
"1820720","1822520"," I got to set up my trade station so that I'm ready. "
"1823800","1825360"," I'll set up the spy for you."
"1827560","1829200"," So you can see where we are where we're headed."
"1832560","1833960"," And I have to make my own plan too. "
"1835440","1838700"," I have to see what I were how I need to be positioned so that I can."
"1840080","1840900"," Hold on here."
"1842740","1845600"," I haven't considered what my plan is. "
"1846420","1848500"," There was so much going on last night that."
"1849620","1853060"," I haven't considered what my monthly plan is until basically."
"1853940","1855140"," Last night today. "
"1855720","1856820"," I'm thinking about it so."
"1858360","1860620"," With the with where we are and what's been going on."
"1860760","1861920"," It wouldn't surprise me. "
"1863580","1866580"," To see this dismantling of."
"1867300","1868000"," Big tech."
"1868300","1871940"," The rest of big tech while buying bottoms in big tech. "
"1872620","1876220"," I wouldn't be shocking to not see Amazon drop anymore."
"1877300","1878240"," Nothing significant."
"1878700","1880540"," Might drop slightly with the market as we trade down. "
"1881100","1882640"," But seeing other companies get whacked."
"1883680","1884260"," That are overvalued."
"1885420","1886240"," That haven't had a bottom. "
"1887880","1890680"," Maybe see some light weakness and trading sideways on Facebook."
"1892020","1893440"," Yeah, like an apple gets whacked."
"1894820","1896540"," Or snow or Shopify. "
"1897340","1897920"," Or Nvidia."
"1898480","1900040"," I know that like fundamentals and."
"1900880","1901880"," There's always going to be shortages. "
"1902120","1902980"," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"1904040","1904840"," You know."
"1905800","1907700"," We saw it happen with Facebook, right. "
"1910120","1911420"," We're going to open it up real quick."
"1913900","1914680"," See what happens."
"1915840","1916820"," It is nine thirty. "
"1926940","1928480"," Yeah, the calls that I bought yesterday."
"1929380","1931080"," After the bell, we're fifteen cents."
"1931300","1932140"," They're now worth two cents. "
"1932620","1934900"," Mark and maker said, thank you for playing."
"1935600","1936340"," Which is fine."
"1936960","1937820"," Totally fine with that. "
"1938260","1939760"," We made a great buddy yesterday."
"1941560","1942840"," So I'm fine with that."
"1943280","1946640"," Matter of fact, I'm going to hold him into the clothes just in case we trade up today. "
"1949040","1950920"," I'm going to give the bulls a chance here."
"1951920","1953940"," They have a chance to."
"1955300","1956860"," This is pretty much their last chance. "
"1957680","1963100"," Today tomorrow, excuse me, today, Monday, next week, maybe, even if we were to trade sideways"
"1963100","1967540"," today, burn the market and trade sideways in the next week."
"1968060","1970580"," They're going to get, I think they're going to get one more chance."
"1973720","1975820"," So that we can break out of this. "
"1977060","1978560"," If we don't break out of this."
"1980920","1982320"," We've got another month of volatility."
"1983100","1984340"," I mean, that's the fact. "
"1985340","1986400"," We don't break out."
"1986500","1987660"," If we don't break out of."
"1992890","1994910"," This trading pattern that we're currently in. "
"1995570","1996730"," Then expect."
"1997330","1999470"," Expect January once again."
"1999870","2000410"," Believe it or not. "
"2001150","2002730"," So I'll give the bulls today."
"2004990","2009350"," And maybe some trading sideways decision making time next week."
"2009930","2012490"," But the runway runs out fast, right?"
"2012630","2012970"," It runs out. "
"2013230","2016310"," We talk about this every month."
"2016310","2018310"," We're already in the fourth."
"2018550","2020530"," We'll come back here on what is it?"
"2020630","2022250"," The seventh rate, other than the sixth. "
"2023910","2028210"," The seventh rate will come back on a money in the seventh and runway just starts running up."
"2029630","2032190"," And so it's the kind of a do or die for the bulls."
"2033270","2035430"," So I might add to those calls actually this morning. "
"2036390","2037390"," Let's see if we make a move higher."
"2039190","2040110"," I'll give it one more chance."
"2040330","2042670"," If we still have some four forties and four forty two. "
"2043310","2045110"," Put spreads for the 18th."
"2045330","2049710"," I said one set of different put spreads that I didn't sell on Friday."
"2050270","2051250"," I sold one set. "
"2051429","2052230"," I held one set."
"2052870","2053969"," I was supposed to see what happens."
"2054150","2055010"," But we are setting up. "
"2055989","2057690"," If you're just tuning in right now, right?"
"2057909","2058550"," Pause the broadcast."
"2059590","2060489"," Go back and watch."
"2061030","2063969"," The beginning of this broadcast. "
"2064310","2064770"," It's critical."
"2065810","2068550"," You know that you may have already known this, but maybe you didn't."
"2068650","2068989"," I don't know. "
"2070610","2079010"," But it's important that you understand the plan for the month of February is just shaping up today."
"2087380","2089000"," Are you guys doing this morning, by the way?"
"2095250","2096230"," Give me that 22."
"2097430","2099450"," All right, give me give me five minutes. "
"2099590","2103250"," I'm going to turn on the trade the news behind the screen."
"2103270","2104250"," I think I can do it."
"2105450","2113600"," I'm going to hold on here. "
"2114760","2116160"," I need to pause this for a minute."
"2116160","2121840"," Okay, guys, because I have to mute this real quick."
"2122520","2123460"," Just a second. "
"2124660","2128660"," I have to log in with some credentials here and I can't have you guys seen my credentials."
"2129860","2130780"," Give me one second here."
"2133600","2134400"," Sorry about that. "
"2135060","2136960"," I didn't log in to trade the news this morning."
"2137780","2144260"," I'll get this up and running for you while I set up my trade station here."
"2146920","2150940"," Just a moment. "
"2166560","2167760"," Just rocking and rolling."
"2171440","2178040"," We'll get my AI, my bot to have a partner here with me this morning talking about the news."
"2180860","2183420"," You're listening to trade the news. "
"2183800","2184440"," Here we go."
"2185600","2186660"," Brock and roll."
"2201100","2202080"," Back up and running. "
"2203600","2206320"," I'm going to bring the news up."
"2212800","2214420"," We should be good to go."
"2215260","2217660"," Just test it real quick again, make sure we're on. "
"2224440","2225420"," We're going here."
"2226800","2227720"," Brock has quality."
"2228160","2228780"," All right. "
"2229480","2231000"," Got a good broadcast quality going."
"2234270","2235050"," We're going to go."
"2239770","2241590"," Yeah, no Facebook being down three percent. "
"2241590","2242350"," It's not a big deal."
"2243170","2244410"," Not in the grand scheme of things."
"2244710","2248770"," So when you have to look at what banks are doing right now, it's actually a good point, Chaz. "
"2249390","2252950"," I want you guys to think about the market from the perspective of a bank."
"2253450","2257210"," Their time horizons are not the same as yours in mind."
"2258170","2261290"," If they're down three percent today, it's just noise. "
"2262350","2265790"," If they go down another 30 or 50 percent, not noise."
"2266790","2270610"," But they're going to trade the market and they're going to invest in the market and they're going"
"2270610","2273230"," to buy the market until it blows up."
"2273770","2274630"," Be warned of that. "
"2275110","2282010"," Be warned that the banks will stay in to the very end no matter what they have to."
"2282390","2284730"," And not only that, money has to go somewhere to make money."
"2285870","2287270"," And their horizon is different. "
"2288950","2291590"," They can stay in for six months, a year, three years."
"2291770","2292210"," They don't care."
"2292970","2299770"," So consider that when you see what they're actually doing in the background is they're buying the"
"2299770","2300030"," market. "
"2302150","2302970"," That's what they're doing."
"2303350","2307850"," Every time we're down, between knocks something down, they're buying it."
"2309770","2314060"," All right, so I'm going to set up my station here. "
"2314620","2316120"," I think we'd love today to be honest with you."
"2316120","2319520"," I think the bear or the bulls have the benefit of the doubt."
"2320060","2325000"," They don't have a lot of runway this month to break out of this trading pattern. "
"2325800","2330600"," If they don't break up above, they got like today."
"2331180","2333460"," They might have a couple days next week to do it."
"2334820","2338420"," The longer that we trade sideways and consolidate over the next. "
"2339420","2343420"," What's called next three to five trading days and they don't do it."
"2345600","2346460"," We're moving down."
"2348240","2350000"," There ain't no two ways about it. "
"2352140","2353220"," The setup is there."
"2361620","2363140"," Get some negative here or right off the bell."
"2369110","2369710"," I'll be right back. "
"2369830","2370690"," I'm just going to pause it."
"2370830","2371770"," I'm going to pause it real quick."
"2372630","2373250"," Take my headphones off. "
"2373410","2374010"," I'll leave my headphones on."
"2374690","2376510"," You guys don't care if I leave my headphones on, do you?"
"2377030","2378530"," I'm just going to set my trade station real quick."
"2442720","2447320"," Just to note that bears are already setting up on 445P. "
"2447960","2451780"," Those are at $1.95. I don't know that I'd be willing to get into those just yet."
"2451920","2457360"," I've seen it oftentimes the more in your city algos position on both sides of the trade."
"2459420","2460760"," But just be aware of it. "
"2460920","2462240"," Keep your eyes on 445P."
"2463700","2465240"," It's firing today, February 4th."
"2467400","2469000"," There's a bunch of calls. "
"2471940","2475940"," As well as a good call spread this morning on February 4th."
"2476040","2482760"," But unless I see the algos jump ship on the other side, just watch it for the maybe the first"
"2482760","2484820"," 15 minutes, 20 minutes or so."
"2485320","2486360"," Let's see what takes place. "
"2554350","2558990"," Also note, VIX looks like it's burning off this morning."
"2559730","2560690"," I attention to VIX today."
"2561770","2570390"," I did talk last time about an event that ended de-risking from"
"2570390","2574030"," dealers. "
"2576190","2577350"," I'm going to watch the VIX."
"2577710","2578330"," We should trade higher."
"2578570","2580470"," I haven't sold my zero dates. "
"2580670","2581450"," I'm holding on to them."
"2582010","2582550"," They were worthless."
"2582550","2583770"," They were like 14 cents. "
"2583950","2584530"," Otherwise, like two."
"2585750","2587010"," So hold on to them today."
"2587090","2588670"," See if we can at least gain something back. "
"2752960","2760140"," So right off the bell we have Nvidia calls February 11th, 250C for $350,000."
"2760560","2769140"," So spy calls February 4th, 447C for $485,000."
"2773340","2777660"," It looks like we get a really wonky on the banks this morning. "
"2778440","2784620"," Like Wells Fargo calls, but then I've got a big BAC calls, but then a ton of other puts against"
"2784620","2785080"," the banks."
"2788000","2789080"," Some Twitter calls."
"2789300","2794140"," Everybody's over on the Twitter the past couple of days, February 11th, 37C, $275,000. "
"2794140","2798980"," More spy calls February 9th, 454C, $133,000."

"2809460","2816180"," More Twitter calls February 11th, 37C for $500,000 in Twitter."
"2816740","2817760"," Watch Twitter."
"2818420","2819880"," I'll bring up Twitter on the list this morning. "
"2819880","2824440"," See why there's still interest on Twitter."
"2826520","2827960"," That was a big beep, wasn't it?"
"2829060","2830780"," Pretty, pretty gnarly beep."
"2832380","2834880"," We'll watch Twitter right off the gate here. "
"2836420","2839380"," There's more, let me see if I didn't see anything interesting here."

"4159470","4163729"," It's critical to our economy to continue to function. "
"4165210","4166790"," You need people back at work working."
"4166790","4171310"," Or if you're bull, you need people back at work working."
"4173970","4176890"," You need people spending money. "
"4178029","4181050"," You need the banks to be providing free money."
"4182450","4185590"," So you've got people trying to make more money for rich people, right?"
"4187510","4190210"," We're talking with the trader hat on here, not the main street hat."
"4191290","4192770"," That's how our economy runs. "
"4199620","4204300"," Now, watching some some dip buyers in cruise lines."
"4205200","4206280"," QQ calls."
"4207680","4210650"," February 18th, 375 C for $331,000. "
"4211780","4212800"," Cruise lines, right?"
"4213000","4214280"," CCL has some calls coming in."
"4216080","4218140"," And CLH has calls coming in."
"4219440","4220440"," I'll dip buyers. "
"4225750","4227950"," Peetons financials will just be a picture of Apple with flames."
"4228490","4232050"," Yeah, I don't think what do you, what is, what can Peetons say?"
"4234290","4235150"," I'm still interested."
"4235510","4238070"," I haven't looked yet at yesterday's put flow on IWM. "
"4238850","4240950"," I was wondering if you guys are interested."
"4242190","4245610"," And we still trade the big caps over the next week or two."
"4246290","4247450"," We stay focused on. "
"4249010","4250430"," This by the S&P."
"4250870","4256170"," Or do we shift over away from the S&P in the queues and we switch and make a shift"
"4256170","4257070"," over to IWM."
"4258050","4260610"," You're all interested in trading at IWM over the next. "
"4261870","4262690"," Two, three weeks."
"4267600","4268860"," You guys interested in that?"
"4269520","4270320"," Yeah, I'm still in run."
"4272940","4274440"," Still in run, still in PTON. "
"4277260","4278960"," Still some pie put spreads."
"4279260","4280280"," I've got some little laggards."
"4280440","4285920"," I've got some, I'm looking at some, you know, it's a real mixed bag like on a Friday. "
"4286900","4289560"," If we don't crank into the clothes, it's like 460."
"4290780","4291540"," It's really weird."
"4291720","4295680"," Like these will be worthless in the next hour or two calls that have will be worthless. "
"4296880","4298880"," Or I'll sell them for the two pennies."
"4300080","4303280"," And then they'll cool crank up to 460 like great for the bell and they'll come right in the money"
"4303280","4304180"," for like 15 cents."
"4304180","4305600"," I kind of made my money back. "
"4307240","4311500"," I don't know if I just lose the two cents or if I just take the two cents and lick"
"4311500","4311940"," my wounds."
"4316860","4317760"," So you guys are saying?"
"4320840","4321960"," Hey Jason, good morning."
"4322040","4322420"," How are you brother?"
"4322880","4323320"," Good to see you. "
"4324880","4328100"," Yeah, I'm interested in maybe shifting over to IWM."
"4337860","4339880"," It could be an interesting trade the next few weeks."
"4343770","4344290"," All right. "
"4344910","4345850"," So I'll spend the weekend."
"4347230","4348590"," I like, I like a."
"4351030","4351790"," Yeah, that's true."
"4351970","4352470"," A V for me. "
"4352550","4353090"," It makes a good point."
"4353210","4356230"," If we are selling out of him, we'll be the nail to the hammer or the hammer to the nail."
"4358090","4359310"," Yeah, 10 year rates to. "
"4360390","4360930"," Up there."
"4361070","4362110"," That has been over a bit."
"4362690","4364710"," That's the thing in the negative territory. "
"4364790","4365770"," Now it's like a positive."
"4373150","4376230"," The idea of you having small caps and mid caps."
"4379370","4383470"," Yeah, I was wondering where you had it, where you were where you disappeared to share an HVAC trade"
"4383470","4384250"," show this week in Vegas. "
"4387230","4388630"," Did anybody need their pipe?"
"4388830","4390710"," Did anybody need their pipes worked on there, Jason?"
"4398840","4400180"," How was Vegas, Jason?"
"4400760","4401980"," What was your take on Vegas?"
"4403540","4407600"," Feel weird still or is it feel like nothing like if we're back to pre COVID?"
"4418600","4419640"," I love trading that."
"4419720","4425520"," I mean, usually, usually we'll slip out of spy and cues and folks about folks on it for like a"
"4425520","4426060"," month or so."
"4429320","4433200"," I was trying to come with like a HVAC joke, but I don't know how many HVAC jokes. "
"4435880","4436940"," But I will trade."
"4437160","4439840"," I do trade small caps a lot."
"4440180","4440720"," Not anymore. "
"4441000","4443560"," I haven't traded small caps in since September."
"4445940","4447680"," Spy has been where it's been after me."
"4448440","4449260"," Tons of money to make. "
"4449540","4453240"," But I think we're getting back into that ER season at IWM."
"4454200","4457600"," I mean, interesting to be an interesting trade."
"4465240","4466820"," Yeah, I don't gamble. "
"4467920","4469540"," I don't play cards in Vegas."
"4470260","4474480"," Like I'll do like the penny slots or something like that to burn some time."
"4475120","4475700"," I go to Vegas. "
"4476400","4478300"," I'll use it as a stopping point."
"4480220","4481680"," But I have friends who live there."
"4482540","4490380"," I'm just interested if your viewpoint on what Vegas seems like versus in previous experiences. "
"4491020","4492580"," I'm assuming you've been there before."
"4495720","4497120"," Just quiet, but people are showing up."
"4500890","4501770"," Hell yeah, Cody. "
"4502410","4503090"," Yeah, trade the news."
"4503310","4504850"," That's some pretty decent shout outs."
"4505550","4508830"," Not 100% of the time, but a lot of those shout outs are pretty good. "
"4513310","4517070"," I'm assuming too that when they make those call outs, people are paying for that information."
"4518850","4519930"," We get to ride with them."
"4525020","4528520"," Chacho in Vegas was apparently pretty quiet because a lot of big manufacturers didn't go. "
"4530820","4531380"," Anytime."
"4531500","4532400"," Anytime Cody, brother."
"4536060","4538960"," Joe Harper was just talking about some trade shows. "
"4539220","4541180"," He attends trade shows."
"4542260","4547060"," He was saying that he's had a lot of them cancel or go remote."
"4549960","4551860"," Just saying he's in there first week in March. "
"4555780","4556940"," Oil stocks are banging."
"4558280","4559640"," All of energy's been banging."
"4560560","4561740"," It's been the easy trade. "
"4563660","4566300"," I think Joe is in a bunch of oil stuff, gas stuff."
"4566960","4569340"," He's been like a bunch of gas trades for the past couple of weeks."
"4570500","4572300"," More oxy calls. "
"4572540","4577520"," February 11th, 45 C, $27,000 CV X."
"4578520","4583500"," CV X 140 C March 18th, $4.5 million."
"4585500","4591740"," It's really weird to see these calls in financials."
"4595620","4598060"," It's a sign of health in the market. "
"4598060","4614520"," It also seems"
"4614520","4624860"," like XLP is"
"4624860","4629520"," not really doing anything today, which is good for bulls."
"4646520","4653120"," XLF is catching a bid today."
"4654660","4656860"," That's a good sign for spy today. "
"4657600","4662240"," We're calling for oil curvions and they see return to profitability in the second half of this year"
"4662240","4663500"," from the attorney in Lima."
"4664840","4666400"," Oh, my con weighed on."
"4666880","4667860"," It's weighing on first quarter. "
"4669040","4670000"," Plus her extent."
"4670780","4671900"," Early second quarter."
"4676120","4679300"," Yeah, watching some dip buyers just before. "
"4682020","4683640"," Mike here, news guy this morning."
"4693480","4700480"," Shopify calls February 11th, 875 C, $700,000 more spy calls all for today."
"4701040","4702840"," February 4th, 449 C just heads up. "
"4703020","4709000"," There's a lot of spy calls, a lot of QQQ calls all stack it up for today."
"4709680","4711960"," Financials look good today."
"4711960","4717520"," Women gloom sectors of spy are not doing well today, which is good. "
"4719020","4721400"," Usually when those doing well, spies not doing well."
"4722120","4723860"," Take one plus one plus one plus one."
"4724660","4729700"," Uber calls February 11th, 37 C, $216,000. "
"4731700","4734600"," I don't know if I talked about mystery at MSTR."
"4734600","4737660"," It would be logical free speed hike."
"4737880","4741220"," It's key interest rate at the latest by next year. "
"4742480","4743800"," Speaking of press interview."
"4745160","4747920"," Ren saying it will be logical free speed hike."
"4748300","4751200"," It's key interest rate at the latest by next year. "
"4753360","4754640"," What year?"
"4755800","4757900"," Maybe guys will watch the."
"4759440","4760820"," Here's CPE."
"4761480","4762300"," Charlie. "
"4765080","4766020"," One second here."
"4771070","4776350"," Yeah, CPE February 18th, 55 C, 356, $356,000."
"4777310","4782750"," Still oil trades are crazy like XOP February 11th, 107 C."
"4783550","4788010"," February 11th, 170, 107, the strike is 107 C."
"4790170","4792630"," XOP, $870,000. "
"4793210","4793870"," They're pricey."
"4795470","4796310"," They're not cheap."
"4797510","4800050"," Sometimes though stuff's cheap for a reason. "
"4800610","4801450"," They're expensive for a reason."
"4804650","4806870"," Do you guys listen to CNBC this morning?"
"4807230","4811150"," I don't normally I don't tune into CNBC too frequently anymore."
"4811950","4814630"," I try not to pollute my brain with CNBC. "
"4815330","4816950"," They will tune in here and there."
"4817250","4819530"," I listened to the jobs numbers this morning from them."
"4820710","4821930"," Everybody looked hungover. "
"4822350","4824850"," Half of them looked like they turned it on last night."
"4825750","4828890"," But then just the wildness of speculation."
"4830550","4832810"," And of course the numbers weren't what they expected. "
"4834310","4835690"," Or the insights of the numbers."
"4836710","4840310"," And then you got one guy calling for a 50 basis point."
"4841030","4841910"," A rate hikes. "
"4843130","4844070"," Then the guy going."
"4845990","4847130"," You know that ain't happening."
"4848990","4852350"," Any other guy coming back and saying, well, I know it's not happening still. "
"4852570","4854170"," There's a whole little chance of it happening."
"4854550","4856770"," But it's a little bit higher than lower than it was before."
"4857150","4858250"," That was hilarious to hear. "
"4864950","4865570"," I don't know."
"4865710","4868590"," I just thought it was hilarious to listen to the conversation on CNBC."
"4872080","4876540"," This is supposed to be the financial news network of the United States, right?"
"4877640","4879020"," It was a fucking disaster. "
"4880180","4882840"," I don't think anybody really cared."
"4884080","4886020"," RCL now climbing, spiking."
"4887000","4891740"," Off those two shout outs on dip buyers on cruise lines. "
"4892500","4895560"," And then you heard trade the news also talk about."
"4896820","4899300"," Some positiveness to bad earnings."
"4901920","4907900"," There's a little pump in RCL and probably Norwegian cruise lines and the others. "
"4909300","4917870"," It runs up 5% baby."
"4918710","4921410"," 5.3%. Come on, run."
"4928220","4928980"," You can do it. "
"4935940","4941320"," XOM up 3.19%. XOM's just green barring it's straight up this morning."
"4945210","4946590"," Tesla's not doing too bad."
"4947710","4948850"," Could be a squeeze play. "
"4948990","4950510"," It is enough runway and Tesla this morning."
"4952870","4955430"," My assumption is that's the..."
"4956710","4959230"," No, I always hate trading Tesla on Fridays."
"4963560","4966760"," You got like a bet for shorts to close. "
"4968260","4972960"," I feel like early morning trade usually on Fridays."
"4974800","4976260"," You get the shorts closing."
"4976540","4978360"," You get some short squeezes up on Tesla. "
"4979120","4980680"," But then you get people trying to take profit."
"4981780","4986440"," So you end up usually getting like a shoe drops at some point."
"4987640","4988840"," We'll take a look at Tesla real quick. "
"4989840","4992340"," Now at 4.48, 41 in spy."
"4997730","4998370"," Tesla."
"4999870","5006340"," I got to stop pressing the delete button four times. "
"5007820","5009900"," That's what makes that bleeping noise."
"5010340","5010680"," That blue."
"5013870","5021660"," I should just get on this computer and turn off all the sounds for the system. "
"5024800","5025520"," Amazon."
"5026660","5028020"," May 20th."
"5028340","5029380"," 3400 C."
"5029740","5031120"," 700,000 dollars. "
"5032120","5032840"," Twilio."
"5033080","5035500"," T.W. L.O. February 11th."
"5035720","5036300"," 240 C."
"5037200","5037220"," High. "
"5037320","5037740"," I'll go score."
"5038300","5039340"," 34,000 dollars."
"5039820","5042340"," More Amazon just stacking calls right now. "
"5043160","5043980"," Stacking calls."
"5044760","5045500"," March 18th."
"5045760","5047940"," 32,000 dollars for 600,000. "
"5050480","5051660"," Talked about that this morning."
"5052200","5055400"," Yesterday was manufactured to drop tickers."
"5056160","5057580"," Same thing for Facebook. "
"5057960","5058840"," Same thing for Amazon."
"5059480","5060780"," Drop them to where they want to buy them."
"5062360","5065000"," Cut out all the noise for earnings. "
"5065400","5066440"," You know, earnings reports, right?"
"5066900","5068000"," All I heard was people bitching yesterday."
"5070080","5075380"," At the end of the day about how fake the ER report is for Amazon."
"5075380","5079060"," And earlier yesterday we talked here about it. "
"5079160","5089080"," I told you guys yesterday I said you've got a story for why a company is"
"5089080","5092940"," selling off for ER, right?"
"5093380","5097440"," We talked yesterday XYZ and they sell off."
"5097980","5105360"," XYZ, they sell off."
"5106660","5110500"," But then the next time you hear XYZ on a company, it doesn't sell off. "
"5111720","5113220"," It's because they already sold it down."
"5113720","5115120"," They bought where they wanted to buy."
"5115600","5117360"," Bank spot at 2733. "
"5118260","5119580"," They are in before you."
"5120660","5122400"," Does that mean we don't trade down further?"
"5122860","5123680"," No, we probably will."
"5124600","5126900"," But they're in before you and they can get out before you. "
"5128020","5131380"," Because they're in it, 2738."
"5132900","5134640"," And so they ran that operation."
"5134980","5137940"," It took place before their actual earnings report. "
"5138700","5143100"," So you can see that earnings reports to some extent don't really matter."
"5144360","5146620"," They do if there's something unknown."
"5148100","5150080"," But the banks know where they want to buy it. "
"5150220","5151300"," They know where they want to sell it."
"5151440","5154400"," They don't care if it sells before or during ER."
"5156420","5160520"," There you know, it's part of the manipulation of this market. "
"5165090","5167190"," It's our job to identify when they've done that, right?"
"5174180","5175740"," Some support down here, 446."
"5176700","5177360"," Literally matters."
"5178720","5181800"," Look above and see where the real sellers are for priority. "
"5183420","5184200"," Not much here."
"5184440","5185300"," We're not looking to watch them spy."
"5189390","5193610"," Just like a data setup or whatever you point you have in the market. "
"5205040","5207380"," There's loads of calls coming in on spy."
"5208760","5209760"," Excuse me on Amazon."
"5211000","5212840"," LVS Las Vegas Sands. "
"5215800","5218340"," Hi, I'll go score Las Vegas Sands LVS."
"5219300","5221380"," February 25th, 45C."
"5222340","5223420"," $800,000. "
"5225220","5228240"," Get the bulls trying to break through this 93950 area."
"5228480","5229120"," I don't think it happens."
"5229540","5230220"," I'll be honest with you. "
"5231580","5233360"," Looks like the even more sellers even lower."
"5233700","5233840"," Nope."
"5234000","5234120"," Yep. "
"5234380","5234620"," Stop there."
"5234740","5235160"," 935."
"5236700","5238000"," Same situation over here. "
"5238140","5238520"," 890."
"5241860","5245100"," I think even if the bulls can do it, they really get what they do."
"5245160","5245980"," Break through 950. "
"5247260","5247880"," Next target."
"5248120","5248620"," 1,000."

"13547840","13551780"," Then you take 10 cents on the other side of that trade as insurance."
"13552680","13558500"," If you don't think that your dollar trade that you're taking in the direction that you wanted to go"
"13558500","13560100"," can't make 100%."
"13561960","13563720"," Then why bother taking the trade?"

"13565540","13567140"," It doesn't make two bucks."
"13568780","13571720"," And can you live with 90 cents out of that dollar that you spent?"
"13572920","13575340"," Because you put on some protection at 10 cents."
"13576180","13580880"," So if you have protection on, yeah, you can stay in the trade for a higher trade, right?"
"13581800","13587440"," If you think we're going to break through the sell wall here at $4.48, $57. "
"13588100","13592760"," Your second choice though, too would be that you just take profit here and then you jump back in"
"13592760","13595460"," above $4.48. $79 and ride it higher."
"13595860","13598940"," You don't get messed up inside of this grind, right?"
"13598940","13601600"," It's like a whole bunch of complications with that argument."
"13602280","13603460"," Do you think we break through?"
"13603800","13604000"," Sure. "
"13604340","13608500"," But why not let the banks break us through and pick up the trade again afterwards?"
"13609420","13614160"," Or maybe you're saying that we break through here and then what if you get caught in some"
"13614160","13615200"," consolidation?"
"13616240","13618520"," You're going to lose all the value of whatever your purchase anyways."
"13618760","13626380"," So I don't see any reason as a retail trader to care about whether we break through this wall or"

"13628460","13629420"," Take the money and run. "
"13630760","13632960"," You know that we're at a resistance level."
"13633160","13638600"," So even if we break through, it's a good place to add to some protection that you have for a"
"13638600","13639620"," downward move from here."
"13640420","13641980"," I hope that makes sense to you. "
"13642220","13643240"," It's not that we can't go higher."
"13643900","13645340"," It's that you take the money and run."
"13646000","13651680"," You pick it back up if you're still bullish here and you can add to a protective position. "
"13652220","13655620"," I think at any point today you can get a rug pull today, tomorrow."
"13655620","13657680"," You have a runway for bulls."
"13657900","13659240"," I'm giving the and this is the other part. "
"13659600","13665480"," I'm giving benefit of doubt to bulls today because they only have so much time to make a move"
"13665480","13665880"," higher."
"13667260","13669420"," As the days progress here."
"13670180","13671600"," Friday over the weekend. "
"13672700","13673900"," Monday, Tuesday."
"13674740","13676100"," If you guys all recall as well."
"13677120","13680520"," I think the first Friday of the month. "
"13681620","13682500"," Of January."
"13685000","13687120"," We had a rug pull I think over that weekend."
"13689020","13690560"," Look at the five days here. "
"13693280","13694820"," You know, you can go back to this week."
"13699380","13700580"," See here was Monday."
"13701420","13704440"," I think the first was Tuesday, right?"
"13705120","13705520"," 31st. "
"13712120","13714720"," I mean, it's worth saying is still getting a mention on the usual."
"13714840","13716460"," We have a green week setting up a lease."
"13716640","13721140"," It looks like we least have a green week setting up, which is nice. "
"13723020","13724740"," The green week is positive for the bulls."
"13724960","13728160"," I mean, this is all kind of like a do or die situation for the bulls."
"13728340","13730040"," If you want to change the narrative that. "
"13732080","13734080"," We don't sell down here."
"13735620","13736840"," Between now and end of month."
"13737480","13738820"," The bulls only have so much runway. "
"13739040","13742020"," They've got, you know, today, maybe a few days next week."
"13743980","13745900"," We are putting together a green week."
"13746600","13747760"," It is a lower high though. "
"13747820","13749160"," It's not like you got a new high."
"13749520","13751380"," Earlier this week."
"13751800","13753280"," There are some positives here. "
"13754500","13756580"," We did so far have a lower low today."
"13758000","13758800"," Versus yesterday."
"13760020","13761540"," To make this more of a neutral day. "
"13761540","13763800"," We need to have a higher high than we did yesterday."
"13764840","13766720"," Which is for 52."
"13767700","13768560"," And some change. "
"13769400","13770460"," So I'm not I'm not anti."
"13770560","13771300"," We go up today."
"13771880","13773740"," I'm just saying your retail trader. "
"13773900","13775520"," You just take your money and run at resistance."
"13776640","13777980"," Which is over here."
"13779120","13781680"," At four forty eight sixty or so. "
"13782320","13784580"," You let the banks do their thing in here."
"13785240","13788120"," Let them break above and then look for a move higher."
"13788320","13790040"," You're going to grab that move higher from here. "
"13790880","13793580"," Sometimes you'll jump above and I'll just start consolidating again."
"13794160","13795780"," So maybe the move the second move is later."
"13796140","13797620"," So you take your take your profit. "
"13797620","13800780"," Add to your protection heading into Monday."
"13803060","13805200"," Because even if we close a green week here."
"13805360","13809740"," You could have a sell the news event between now and even next Friday. "
"13811400","13812700"," Put some protection on."
"13814580","13815920"," As you trade this higher."
"13816820","13818100"," Is the point I'm trying to make. "
"13818780","13820820"," It shouldn't be right in this market."
"13822220","13824860"," Just like I'm holding calls from holding puts."
"13825700","13826640"," Anything like that. "
"13827240","13829740"," And you know the other part of this market too is."
"13830300","13831420"," Theta gang's getting wrecked."
"13832320","13836420"," I was I was reading the conversation yesterday about theta gang. "
"13836640","13838220"," Theta gang's getting torn up right now."
"13838660","13840120"," So if theta gang's getting torn up."
"13840660","13844440"," You as a bull or bear or holding just one side of. "
"13844440","13847740"," Of the puzzle right."
"13848000","13851860"," You just I've never used more straddles than I have recent as a recent."
"13853160","13857780"," Extrattling the market because I think that the volatility levels in the market are so high that"
"13857780","13859420"," there's a rug pull at any moment. "
"13859420","13864640"," There's a rip at any moment waiting to trap you and how many of these happen in a day."
"13865200","13867760"," How many do you get right as a trader."
"13869280","13871320"," That you eventually get ground down to dust. "
"13871320","13877200"," So I think the straddles as we've talked about the straddle like straddling the market is just key."
"13877580","13878880"," Especially when you're in a high right now."
"13879320","13882440"," We're in a high up here at this four forty eight level. "
"13883500","13889360"," Talked earlier this morning about being range bound until a decision is made either either up or"
"13889360","13889740"," down."
"13890500","13891220"," So you're going to."
"13891420","13894760"," So the expectation today would be we trade back down to four forty three. "
"13895100","13896240"," I'm not saying that happens."
"13896240","13902000"," Just saying that you know we're up down up down up down to make these kind of moves here."
"13902840","13909140"," Take your money and run on the side that's printed and then add to a further downward position with"
"13909140","13909980"," some of those winnings. "
"13910560","13915720"," And then when you're ready to take the next move higher wait for a move above again four forty"
"13915720","13916980"," eight seventy five."
"13918700","13919960"," And you take the next slide."
"13921620","13925240"," The next part would be I'm going to read to you something from spot gamma this morning. "
"13925380","13926080"," This was their report."
"13927620","13929680"," I'll just give you the low down on it."
"13930300","13933360"," It says futures have broken lower two four four eight zero. "
"13933760","13935920"," Just pushed our gamma index to the negative side."
"13936380","13941220"," And with that our volatility estimates shifts to a high one point nine two percent."
"13941880","13946020"," We see resistance at five four five two five and four five. "
"13946580","13947380"," Five six."
"13947380","13952180"," Support is at four four five zero then four three nine seven."
"13952820","13957900"," Negative gamma is poised for high volatility as is the elevated levels of options implied"
"13957900","13958400"," volatility. "
"13959840","13961200"," That can work both ways."
"13961700","13963380"," Yesterday's data in our hero indicator."
"13963940","13967640"," Real times option delta is traded was very negative as discussed last night. "
"13968000","13973700"," The negative delta is registered were quite large and spread across both big indexes and stock"
"13973700","13974140"," leaders."
"13974140","13976080"," Apple, Facebook, Google and Tesla."
"13977140","13981900"," Additionally or accordingly the cash close was quite ugly as the market broke sharply through the"
"13981900","13982760"," key forty five hundred. "
"13983760","13984280"," Support level."
"13985740","13989780"," Well Amazon's earnings provided after our futures boost that has faded."
"13989780","13991720"," All eyes are likely on the eight thirty jobs report. "
"13992180","13996440"," Part of the report plays in the options position which is already poised for large moving."
"13997040","14001140"," At this point Paul gamma at strikes above is not significant."
"14001980","14003140"," That's a key note right. "
"14003360","14005180"," We don't have significant outside the money."
"14005680","14007340"," Our data calls on the big indexes."
"14007900","14010540"," So if markets can break four five two five. "
"14011420","14013800"," The gamma base resistance above is fairly light."
"14014500","14017740"," The put strikes both at the money and below have a fair amount of gamma."
"14018020","14020140"," You can see this in the image below whatever. "
"14021300","14024300"," With that said the downside risks remain quite elevated."
"14024340","14025200"," This is what's key."
"14025980","14029940"," The downside risks remain quite elevated as we outlined yesterday's and yesterday's am note. "
"14029940","14034000"," If the market slides lower it's likely accompanied by an increase in implied volatility."
"14034800","14038140"," Increases downside dealer hedging requirements which pressure the market lower."
"14038700","14044140"," As we have a negative gain position a macro or fundamental non option option based selling would"
"14044140","14046160"," likely be met with additional dealers selling. "
"14046880","14049980"," The risk remains high as long as markets are below four five two five."
"14051000","14053640"," We're still below four top five two five right now."
"14054000","14057380"," While we have focused on and give edge to the downside risks we must acknowledge. "
"14057380","14060620"," Potential exists for a sharp upside move to forty six hundred."
"14061220","14066320"," Puts being covered in sharp reduction implied volatility do offer potential for a violent rally."
"14067300","14069840"," So the point of the try to make here is that. "
"14070660","14076980"," We you're going to expect if we're below four five two five right which we're seeing resistance"
"14076980","14077440"," here."
"14078360","14082720"," At four four eight point six two right the take the trade up to this level."
"14083240","14084160"," Take your money and run. "
"14085120","14091100"," If we get above and let's just say the four five two five level has moved down now to four"
"14091100","14092280"," four six two."
"14092660","14097720"," You'll you just wait until we jump back up here to this four four eight above this four four eight"
"14097720","14098480"," point seven four."
"14098620","14101060"," Then you ride this higher to forty six hundred. "
"14102640","14108180"," And they're also noting throughout the morning note this morning that there can be violent moves."
"14108240","14110160"," So we're up here right now."
"14110160","14115960"," The implication is also that if we don't break above here you can see a violent selling move down"
"14115960","14116980"," below at some point. "
"14117460","14122140"," That's when we talk about runway how much time do we have to make something like this happen."
"14123320","14127280"," So I would take your profit and then wait for the next leg above."
"14131670","14136750"," Or just stay in the trade and if you see the value of your calls burn off while we are"
"14136750","14137850"," breaking through here. "
"14137850","14142970"," It'll be a way to write and write yourself a journal or a diary."
"14143530","14146430"," Should I have stayed in this trade or should I have taken the money?"
"14147350","14151790"," Or would I have made more money if I took the trade to this level and then reentered later on."
"14152490","14156830"," Just keep a journal of your your experiences my experiences have been. "
"14157410","14162290"," If you do this do this ten times in a row you're going to more than likely lose three to"
"14162290","14163030"," four times."
"14214710","14217050"," I'll make a point in no tear as well."
"14217890","14223690"," The 450 C's that I had were worth 80 cents at one point. "
"14224350","14226710"," They're now down to 66 cents."
"14227650","14234930"," So had you taken your money and ran you could reenter the trade on a bullish bias or higher."
"14236870","14242950"," Now you're kind of stuck in your trade you're stuck in a risk scenario that you may or may not"
"14242950","14243730"," go up from here. "
"14244530","14249110"," So you're you're layering your risk on you're doubling the risk that you need to take on here at"
"14249110","14249550"," this point."
"14252370","14253750"," If that makes any sense."
"14254610","14258630"," So in a directional move if you're buying zero dates one dates three dates. "
"14259510","14262950"," There's no intrinsic value inside those options you want to take them for the run."
"14265010","14270930"," You buy them in ABC or one two three right as a as let's say the ETF is moving down"
"14270930","14272930"," and you're expecting a swing higher."
"14273510","14275050"," You put on risk your risk. "
"14276490","14276930"," Right."
"14277630","14282410"," You start to average in view let's say the let's say the ETF is at four forty."
"14282810","14285830"," It trades down to four forty nine but you know it's going to four forty five. "
"14286310","14288630"," Let's say you start at four forty you grab some calls."
"14289370","14293950"," Tips down to four thirty nine you grab some more calls as you're heading back up you grab some more"
"14293950","14296110"," calls you have a nice out cost average base."
"14296670","14300730"," And basis and then your target let's say is four forty five so you write it up to four forty"
"14300730","14301090"," five. "
"14301770","14304410"," You have a target in your mind where you think it's going."
"14305010","14309450"," You're watching book map you can find out where the resistance level is as you get close to there"
"14309450","14311050"," you take your money out of that option."
"14311590","14313350"," The value that wasn't taken. "
"14313350","14320710"," And then you wait for the move higher here you let someone else do the work for you for your"
"14320710","14322190"," next price target above."
"14322790","14327870"," So if they were saying forty five fifty two and let's say this is from this morning at nine or"
"14327870","14332310"," I believe they really sit this morning at you know whatever six seven a.m. eight a.m. you usually"
"14332310","14337410"," lay with it but you know you adjust for the day here."
"14338390","14343030"," Now I'm assuming that the four fifty two is here at this level you pick it up from this point"
"14343030","14345790"," forward again once again and move higher. "
"14346470","14352510"," And all along we're in a negative environment right the markets in a negative environment there's"
"14352510","14357810"," nothing bullish about this market at this moment we have to trade much higher become actually"
"14357810","14358250"," bullish."
"14359410","14365910"," So protection is though is the key it's critical not to save your accounts that if we continue in"
"14365910","14368250"," this market to let's say for the next two months."
"14369350","14375170"," You'll get shaken out without a doubt you won't last you'll burn I don't care how big your account"
"14375170","14378750"," is you won't last over the next month or so. "
"14381440","14385140"," So you'll see here I want to show you this too so the four fifty is just popped up to"
"14385140","14386480"," eighty cents once more right."
"14386480","14392140"," We're going to see if they stick around at eighty cents after the if we make a break higher here."
"14392600","14399780"," And see if they lean we lean off on their value again you should be watching the options chain of"
"14399780","14402420"," the option that you're in. "
"14402900","14406460"," And just see the ebb and flow of value within that that zero day."
"14408260","14413700"," And see if you're able to take profit here or see the volatility that we encounter in these"
"14413700","14414580"," resistance levels."
"14414580","14416800"," And the danger that's involved in this. "
"14423370","14428110"," You match these up also with traditional charting methods right if you're looking for one two and"
"14428110","14428650"," then move higher."
"14429130","14433930"," Or if you're looking for a pair and you got one tag two tag and we we end up coming"
"14433930","14434270"," down."
"14435170","14439090"," You can apply the classic charting techniques and setups. "
"14440770","14444410"," Along with book map."
"14446760","14450600"," I also use volume profile stuff like that and options flow of course."
"14451560","14454260"," But you are looking to see if there's any rejection here. "
"14456900","14461260"," And then let all this work be done take your money and run then get back in above and take"
"14461260","14461520"," it higher."
"14465300","14466520"," Does that help anybody out there."
"14472580","14476820"," You know the further point to it be if you made this run with us up here in these calls. "
"14477700","14478840"," Take the money and run."
"14479360","14484460"," Let's say let's say you spent a hundred dollars and you made another hundred so you're out with two"
"14484460","14484780"," hundred."
"14485580","14489460"," You shouldn't be trading for your second trade with two hundred dollars right. "
"14490300","14493580"," You're just skimming off some of that money for a better setup."
"14494400","14497020"," And especially if you want to reenter this trade a second time."
"14497800","14502920"," It's always good to you know take profit and use smaller amounts of money for your trading. "
"14502920","14505420"," Whether you're not ultimately blowing up your account."
"14514720","14517460"," Let me explain this again one more time to you guys."
"14517740","14523540"," So let's say so the calls that I bought this morning I think there were 46 cents or something like"
"14523540","14523760"," that. "
"14524260","14529700"," And then they went they dipped down I think to 26 or 36 cents added some more on there."
"14531340","14535700"," We bounced off that bottom at 440 I think it was 443 or something right."
"14535700","14538000"," Yeah 443 you bounced off there. "
"14539420","14541000"," So dollar cost average in there."
"14541120","14545400"," Let's just say that the calls cost me a dollar and I'm writing them up."
"14545580","14550320"," I have a viewpoint that we're going to go to 448.55 right. "
"14551020","14552320"," That's my target price."
"14552880","14555140"," So I run those up for a hundred percent."
"14555800","14559820"," Meanwhile I'm going to buy some 10 cents or 20 cents or 30 cents puts. "
"14559820","14562620"," A farther out maybe on Monday."
"14563860","14568800"," And so I have to that's a cost of me making that money in this run up here."
"14570000","14571480"," That makes any sense to you. "
"14576700","14580400"," And then if you do this 10 times 12 time or just 10 times."
"14581200","14585100"," You'll find out how often they work this set up works for you."
"14585820","14591340"," But I assure you if you just you know buy calls and hope and pray that we're going to tag"
"14591340","14592220"," 460. "
"14593460","14596220"," That you know you're going to blow your account up at some point."
"14596500","14597560"," That's how you blow a concept."
"14600040","14600980"," We're not about blow. "
"14601180","14603620"," We can't be we can't be talking about zero to eight options."
"14604740","14609120"," And not talk about the risks involved with trying to just."
"14609880","14611440"," Maxi everything out all the time. "
"14611900","14616760"," They need to open other people in that trade and plan and they blow up their accounts."
"14656010","14658730"," Look above and see if there's that 460 target."
"14682260","14683220"," Go look here. "
"14684180","14692320"," A little bit of resistance here at the last bit of resistance or heavy resistance is at 45372."

"16066740","16067800"," All the size here is just volatility. "
"16069040","16070500"," Price target should be four sixty."
"16070900","16071540"," Maybe slightly lower."
"16072560","16076340"," If the sellers came down from four fifty two. "
"16077760","16079820"," That volatility level came down."
"16081780","16083280"," It's kind of still here isn't it."
"16086260","16088080"," That's a little rough area here. "
"16089040","16091080"," But that would open the door to four sixty I think."
"16092880","16094880"," I'm resistance at four fifty six."
"16095500","16098820"," A little bit about normal places. "
"16099920","16104260"," Ultimately four sixty is the target right here."
"16128700","16134020"," I mean if you think if we slide down here into you guys looking at a regular chart here with"
"16134020","16134520"," a little."

"16161140","16165080"," Do you think we come we trade back down to a bounce off four forty six eighty three. "
"16165540","16166700"," And then move higher."
"16167040","16169360"," This is a usual setup right here these these setups."
"16171000","16174860"," You'll see us trade right higher higher right here will get weak. "
"16175680","16177360"," Trap some bulls in here."
"16178520","16183380"," Fade down into like the two two o'clock three o'clock hour."
"16184380","16189900"," Then we rip higher once more for a tag higher and we can squeeze all the way to the top. "
"16191580","16193040"," We have these setups often."
"16194360","16197260"," Look at a chart on the spine a daily chart."
"16200700","16205280"," Time of day one twenty eight in the afternoon sometimes we get some you know sideways movement"
"16205280","16205680"," here. "
"16205820","16206500"," Trap some bulls."
"16207840","16209860"," Require more spend more money spending."
"16210660","16211240"," Take us higher. "
"16212440","16213520"," Still money coming in though."
"16214000","16218360"," We got spy calls just came in right now for fifty C's for a hundred thousand dollars."
"16218360","16221740"," Ask you I'm just wondering if you look at a chart right now. "
"16221980","16226280"," Do you think we start trading sideways a little capitulation move they always do."
"16226960","16233080"," Dip low everybody panics but you grab that dip and run it up to you know four fifty five four"
"16233080","16234260"," sixty into the bell."
"16235100","16236540"," Let me know in the comments I've been looking. "
"16239940","16243240"," This whole setup for today is a pretty common setup."
"16245740","16249460"," All you know what I'll do is I'll take a snapshot of it and put it on Twitter."
"16252650","16254150"," If you guys know what I'm talking about. "
"16267700","16271700"," Seems like a common thing when you're in the day trade and you see this setup right here."
"16276060","16277660"," I'm kind of nonsense like this."
"16286560","16288700"," Excuse my crayons. "
"16291840","16293700"," I'll post this on Twitter right now."
"16303170","16304770"," It's on ad captain's alpha."
"16308720","16312260"," What do you think we sell off into the bell is that's the second. "
"16313660","16315340"," Maybe we'd have a fake pump up."
"16315700","16318400"," I think we we do drive up here into four sixty."
"16321860","16326820"," One pump two pumps and then boom big three pumps up into the close. "
"16327020","16329920"," Solidating after the latest run up."
"16330140","16331600"," It has a couple of point seven percent."
"16331880","16333940"," The more than seven tenths. "
"16335160","16339160"," Yes he just heard our boy Charlie here say that we're consolidating."
"16339900","16342760"," So he's kind of confirming that same theory."
"16343640","16348260"," A little bit of consolidation between now and I want to call it like two. "
"16349480","16350780"," It's one thirty right now."
"16350780","16354640"," Maybe consolidate two o'clock to thirty and make a run higher."
"16356320","16357540"," And I don't know that guy. "
"16358220","16359940"," He just came out and said it after I said it."
"16361640","16363260"," He can he can beat it."
"16365260","16369960"," I'm just popping in and out of calls. "
"16370500","16371700"," Every pump that we take."
"16372120","16376780"," I take some calls and I sell and I take them again and I sell."
"16377720","16380480"," This is the I've done two sets now calls. "
"16382600","16384660"," I'm going to look I just posted on Twitter."
"16385200","16388779"," I'm going to look for a buy right where I right where that dip is down there."
"16388900","16390599"," I'm going to start reentering again. "
"16392300","16396599"," And if I miss it I miss it but I'm going to think there's a false break out here coming"
"16396599","16396840"," up."
"16401680","16405680"," What I'll do is I'll try to catch this dip at some point."
"16408099","16410500"," Closer on my trailer lines. "
"16410820","16414340"," Probably I'm going to try to grab this dip around like two o'clock to thirty."
"16415200","16419660"," I may be right around the three o'clock hour and I'll average in for a run up."
"16420360","16424500"," I've got a bunch of I just added more puts for like pennies I think. "
"16425020","16431520"," I just buy about a bunch of February 7 for 30 keys in case there's failure."
"16432279","16435419"," I'm up to I don't know a few hundred so."
"16437320","16440099"," I've got a bunch now I just bought at a six cents. "
"16441140","16441939"," Actually filled."
"16443099","16444439"," Combine them all day long."
"16445320","16446939"," Add them add them add them. "
"16447820","16451380"," So if this fails protected and I can take the run up again."
"16452580","16453520"," For a trade hired."
"16453820","16455380"," I think we could squeeze up to 460. "
"16457200","16458599"," We'll see if that happens."
"16459880","16461480"," We can squeeze higher to 460."
"16462419","16465200"," I bet that we consolidate somewhere down in here. "
"16465360","16467140"," I bet back at that 448 level."
"16467560","16471080"," Maybe even a slight more capitulation if it drags out."
"16472160","16475080"," And then we'll take a run up into the close for 460. "
"16477200","16478939"," I'm going to check back with you guys here."
"16479060","16480500"," I don't think it's going to go right now."
"16480500","16481919"," I don't think it's going to rip right now. "
"16482259","16483419"," I'm going to get off again."
"16484599","16487480"," And if I see this trade sideways consolidate."
"16488380","16489619"," We start making this move up. "
"16490660","16493259"," I'll come back on again for the next for the next run."
"16494919","16495480"," Okay."
"16496759","16499180"," And we've got more Netflix calls coming in. "
"16500400","16504500"," Lots of lots of tech calls coming in."
"16504500","16505360"," It's going to spread around."
"16505360","16510040"," SQ, Netflix, Tesla, Amazon, Facebook. "
"16512020","16513439"," It's nice that it's spread around."
"16517130","16518630"," Maybe we do just rip higher now."
"16518970","16519250"," It's possible. "
"16520090","16520849"," But I think it's a fake out."
"16521430","16523250"," If you're asking me, I think it's a fake out."
"16525189","16526050"," We have more consolidation. "
"16526669","16528650"," It's going to look like a breakout and that's going to consolidate."
"16529750","16530369"," We'll make a run higher."
"16533160","16534000"," But I've been wrong. "
"16535259","16537220"," You guys want to false the wallet."
"16537460","16538419"," You have right at it."
"16541080","16541640"," Oh, sorry. "
"16541759","16541980"," I'm looking."
"16542720","16543040"," Okay."
"16543080","16543320"," I'm back. "
"16543540","16544740"," I'm looking at that chart right now."
"16544800","16544960"," Sorry."
"16545080","16546980"," I'm looking at charts and I'm looking at you guys. "
"16550490","16553650"," Let me scroll higher and take a look at the first few minutes."
"16562050","16562750"," You know, it's weird."
"16562950","16566330"," I think if we push higher now, I think if we, you know how we do this. "
"16566490","16567669"," Sometimes it's like we'll push high."
"16567669","16572669"," If we push higher above like four, fifth, this whole like rough ice zone in here."
"16572810","16578550"," If we break above it into clothes, you can sometimes, you ever see that creepy crawly wall?"
"16578750","16581349"," We're like, well, I just crawl up for the last five minutes. "
"16582029","16585869"," You know, sometimes you'll get a quick dip at the last 15 minutes or so."
"16586270","16589369"," Then you like crawl the wall of worry all up to 460."
"16590470","16592050"," I mean, this is it for the bulls. "
"16592330","16595130"," Like the bulls have to get up to 460."
"16596050","16602810"," And if the cash market can't get us over that huge resistance, that resistance channel we have"
"16602810","16609669"," going back to the beginning of January, the only chance to get over it might be having the futures"
"16609669","16613710"," send the market over to take a look."
"16614029","16615169"," We weren't able to take a look. "
"16615330","16615490"," Yes."
"16615689","16618750"," It was a yesterday before and for us to take a look above."
"16619270","16620810"," Sometimes futures will do it for you. "
"16621630","16623029"," Just that one last look."
"16623169","16624150"," Are you sure you want to go down?"
"16624150","16625950"," Because you're talking about an entire month."
"16626450","16630009"," I'm not saying we won't trade down for the entire month, but it could get brutal. "
"16631810","16635669"," There's some things that need to happen for the bulls sooner than later."
"16637310","16641750"," And if they don't happen, it triggers some really ugly market moves."
"16649220","16650180"," I pull up CRM. "
"16650300","16651380"," Yeah, I'll pull up CRM for you."
"16652480","16653300"," Where I exploit for of course."
"16654480","16658369"," I won't get off right now real quick. "
"16658490","16661770"," I'll read what you guys are saying and see if I can help you guys out."
"16661770","16665480"," I'll pull up some CRM here."
"16668860","16674580"," When you hear me talk about these setups, I've been trading these setups for like 12 years. "
"16676279","16677340"," I don't know."
"16678900","16682560"," Some of you guys are saying we were like a magnet to this number."
"16682720","16686000"," I've been trading this shit for so long that it all looks the same after a while. "
"16686640","16690619"," The same similar setups have been burned too many times."
"16690619","16693279"," Like we could trade straight up from right here."
"16693779","16698119"," But if you, this setup specifically, right, is we have it once a week. "
"16699540","16701400"," And they usually fail."
"16701820","16703240"," They don't fail fully."
"16703540","16707400"," They usually consolidate for a period of time for an hour or two. "
"16708400","16712410"," And then we trade higher."
"16716080","16718040"," Yeah, I keep adding to my 430s."
"16718800","16719320"," Absolutely. "
"16720119","16721200"," The cost of doing business."
"16722520","16722960"," Hands down."
"16723599","16725119"," I don't care if they burn to the ground. "
"16725820","16730580"," As long as we keep going up to, if we keep going up to 460, then just about 6 cents."
"16731060","16733080"," I know you guys lose more than 6 cents on your trades."
"16733660","16737200"," I know you guys lose more than 30 cents on your trades all the time. "
"16738980","16742259"," So if you're going to buy some protection, might as well."
"16745050","16746290"," Moon shot into the weekend."
"16746290","16747990"," Wind, wind, mud. "
"16748610","16749390"," 6 pound stuff."
"16749669","16749750"," 23."
"16750470","16753150"," I'm getting some problems with my chat again. "
"16755369","16756669"," Let me scroll back up here."
"16756790","16757770"," I'm trying to scroll up, right?"
"16757950","16758590"," It's getting really weird."
"16758849","16760730"," Like chat is not doing it. "
"16765740","16766520"," Let's see here."
"16770630","16771610"," I'm in and out of calls."
"16771950","16773869"," Every time I get to resistance, I sell calls. "
"16783710","16784590"," I don't know with a large block."
"16786970","16787850"," Boobers on a tear."
"16788110","16788350"," Nice. "
"16796070","16796510"," Yeah."
"16803780","16804040"," We'll end up."
"16804140","16805780"," We'll do is we'll trade sideways here. "
"16806300","16811600"," You guys, I mean, what I will do will typically will do is we'll trade sideways and down."
"16812600","16813500"," There'll be some panic."
"16813840","16814280"," You'll fold. "
"16815040","16816280"," Don't want to pry into the close."
"16816500","16817160"," You'll actually see."
"16817160","16821420"," I'm not saying this is going to guarantee to be happening today, but you'll end up seeing this"
"16821420","16824440"," creepy crawly all the way up the wall into the close. "
"16824940","16827520"," That's typically like shorts closing out the weekend."
"16830020","16832500"," You're listening to trade the news."
"16834920","16835580"," Yeah, Omar. "
"16835760","16836280"," I saw your stuff."
"16836480","16837300"," I saw your message, Omar."
"16837940","16844880"," Oh, yeah. "
"16845160","16847100"," So we had a big snowstorm out here."
"16848020","16853240"," And my internet again is, but I think it's snowstorm related."
"16853900","16857760"," I was having a, I'm having some slow internet for you. "
"16857900","16861500"," I'm having like lag in the book map today."
"16861840","16865340"," So I turned the camera off so it didn't tax as much."
"16873510","16874030"," Yeah. "
"16874190","16875630"," So if you guys look at."
"16881360","16882860"," Oh, yeah, I was on video earlier."
"16883100","16884560"," I had the video on earlier today. "
"16889250","16891950"," If we get closer to the end of the day, we always do this wrap."
"16892150","16895250"," We'll have a cocktail together and every Friday we have a cocktail together."
"16895250","16895990"," I'll put a hat on. "
"16896190","16897410"," I'll put a new hat on today."
"16898790","16900190"," We just have a cocktail on Fridays."
"16900750","16901950"," We'll have one today, of course. "
"16908900","16910740"," So just that, just take a look at that."
"16910840","16915040"," I think I post that set up pretty frequently on Twitter."
"16917380","16918420"," Probably every Friday. "
"16920440","16922200"," But it's a pretty common setup."
"16924280","16926380"," So what does that mean when you have a common setup, right?"
"16926740","16931400"," If you're a day trader, that means you're anticipating something like that happening."
"16934060","16938680"," It means that there's other traders out there that are anticipating something like that happening. "
"16940240","16944720"," It means like it's not just me, but there's like other people that are expecting something like"
"16944720","16945340"," that to happen."
"16945660","16946640"," Does it mean it always happens?"
"16946640","16947060"," No."
"16947680","16949000"," Does it mean I might miss it?"
"16949260","16949500"," Sure. "
"16950360","16957440"," But if it follows that pattern frequently enough, let's say we do trade down, it means there's"
"16957440","16962340"," going to be a bunch of people interested in buying that dip on a rip up into the bell."
"16964720","16966140"," That's the point that I'm trying to make."
"16969280","16969760"," Right. "
"16969920","16971060"," So you're looking for those patterns."
"16971220","16974000"," If you see those patterns, you start to look."
"16974860","16976840"," I didn't really see much on CRM there, buddy. "
"16977020","16979460"," I just deleted that on your wife's boyfriend."

"16988680","16989040"," My bad. "
"16990240","16992060"," This is the most resistance here at 451."
"16992780","16993740"," Get some more at 452."
"16994700","16996000"," Some sellers you got to wear out. "
"16996500","16997560"," Just wearing out these sellers."
"17006400","17010600"," Wear out these sellers for a little bit."

"17036770","17039370"," If there is some news coming out that we don't know about."
"17045610","17047230"," Leave this one right here. "
"17047230","17050690"," You guys will see these resistance levels as a trade higher here."
"17051170","17054650"," 450, 95, 450, 189."
"17056030","17059830"," So you guys can see this in case we come up and bounce, come up and bounce. "
"17060890","17062290"," And finally make that nice rip up."
"17066740","17067200"," Yeah."
"17067460","17072780"," So what happens with so normally it's like if I'm just running book map on any computer, I've got"

"17143050","17143870"," It's possible."
"17144430","17145870"," We make the mad rush to 452."
"17146950","17149190"," Then trade sideways and we're off for the racist to 460. "
"17150690","17151570"," We kind of cool."
"17152750","17154530"," But I'm not in calls right now."

"17203590","17205810"," We're going to see if Tesla bulls can actually break through here."

"17278330","17281790"," Nice bash and smash and grab above here, 451."
"17283290","17287410"," And you saw these sellers pop above here at 451, 1993. "
"17293310","17295250"," On the spot, take note of that."
"17297390","17299370"," Once Tesla's loaded, we'll switch over."
"17300090","17301350"," Check it on the Tesla gang. "
"17301570","17307790"," Make sure they can get through 9.30. This is almost a perfect trade on Tesla today."
"17308470","17312950"," Pick it up at 881, ride it up to 9.30. If you look at the Tesla chart, this is"
"17312950","17316350"," basically the trading zone on Tesla."

"17334310","17336810"," Neo puts February 18th, 22p. "
"17339110","17339990"," $188,000."
"17345280","17347180"," So, you'll get Tesla and see if they can break through."
"17349500","17351040"," Kind of a hard rejection here. "
"17351640","17359420"," This is nice damage done over here at 9.25. I think as a new to the channel, this is"
"17359420","17360200"," what you want to be looking for."
"17360420","17361060"," You see all this?"
"17361680","17362780"," This is all light resistance."
"17362780","17365240"," Then you've got larger resistance above here. "
"17365560","17367540"," 9.29, 89."
"17368920","17370300"," Just hard rejection."
"17371120","17372260"," Not a bad thing though. "
"17372900","17374060"," We'll make it look higher."
"17376720","17382020"," Movement of US forces that have been outlined by the White House."
"17392950","17394270"," I think that's that. "
"17404110","17408330"," So, this is, there was a previously announced deployment of US troops."
"17408750","17409650"," We talked about that right there."
"17409650","17414930"," They're going to get moved from Germany to I think Romania and Poland. "
"17415390","17419530"," I guess they arrive in Poland tomorrow."
"17452220","17454320"," Lots of buyers on Tesla today."
"17455720","17456980"," Here are indicators outstanding. "
"17459380","17470740"," Smacked right at the top here at 9.30. There's"
"17470740","17474700"," more resistance above here at 9.34. We'll look higher."
"17475220","17476160"," See if that's still that viable."
"17477340","17485860"," 9.50. The price target is 9.50. All kinds of volatility from here to 9.50 on Tesla. "
"17487300","17495710"," The view up down below at 9.23. Be careful of, it's not that we can't trade higher here."
"17496450","17500470"," Be careful of profit taking here."
"17517710","17519910"," Now, 4.48 wasn't really the level. "
"17520410","17526170"," Looks like this is for 4.52.15. This actually matches what the spot gamma was saying."
"17528030","17529970"," This is the actual volatility level."
"17530170","17531490"," This is the rejection point. "
"17531490","17536510"," We should squeeze higher above 4.52. Zero."
"17536870","17539330"," This says slightly more, but close enough."
"17540310","17549350"," We'll see if we can get a squeeze higher above 4.52. We'll stay on the spy. "
"17551110","17555170"," Watching more spy calls come in February 4, 450C."

"17588810","17589610"," I like seeing it. "
"17590490","17592970"," I like seeing the bulls take some initiative here."
"17593570","17604050"," I guess you would need Tesla to participate, right?"
"17604770","17609850"," At the end of day, if we're going to go up to 4.60. Maybe that's the trade, right?"
"17610490","17614850"," The Texas Instruments TXM filing for a mixed shelf in January, November."
"17622320","17625780"," Quinn Quinn Quinn Quinn's all pissed off. "
"17626860","17627860"," Is he in here?"
"17628260","17631040"," Is Quinn, I just saw our text, our tweet from Quinn."
"17631820","17634580"," Can I, uh, can I downvote that tweet?"
"17637020","17637540"," Quinn's tweet."
"17637960","17638720"," We look at that. "

"17643700","17644980"," We can reply to your posts. "

"17835500","17842160"," They were seeing TXN calls all morning, and they filed a mixed security shelf."
"17847120","17848140"," It's like they're selling."
"17858760","17861680"," Yeah, the selling shares, the payoff debt. "
"17864120","17865280"," Probably pay bonuses."
"17870200","17875840"," A bunch of TXN calls all day long, and they start selling shares."
"17877880","17878600"," Too funny. "
"17880560","17882980"," You have buy the rips or buy the rips on a dip."
"17883640","17884000"," Exactly."
"17886840","17888040"," Just buy a short here. "
"17888700","17889800"," I don't know if it's a short."
"17890040","17893940"," I know it's probably, I think it's still, even though we had that quick rip up, I still think it's"
"17893940","17894300"," consolidation."
"17895800","17897780"," I'm not in this trade here at this point. "
"17898120","17899280"," There's the long side of this trade."
"17899420","17900140"," I'm not in it right now."
"17900980","17903640"," This is a trap to me, even if it's on a short time frame. "
"17905140","17909260"," So I'm just waiting for the quick dip, and then the rip into close."
"17911040","17916420"," Although there is a lot of calls coming in across the board, and I can't deny that calls coming in"
"17916420","17926870"," all over the place on tech and on the spy on the"
"17926870","17929890"," cues across the board everywhere, which is good."
"17929890","17934410"," So we could bypass the afternoon dip and go straight north. "
"17936910","17938810"," But it would be a break in one of my trading rules."
"17939130","17942310"," I'd rather miss this part rip north and then pick it back up again."
"17943230","17946750"," But the thought process is we consolidate the trade higher. "
"17947250","17953810"," If we can break through that 452, 453, 454, that last area up here."
"17954590","17956090"," We can break up this area up here."
"17956090","17958590"," You see that sneaky peak. "
"17958850","17962390"," We ended up climbing the wall in the last 15 minutes or so."
"17962790","17964930"," Sometimes we get another quick stipulation."
"17965570","17969630"," It's a short covering rally straight up the wall, the 460 into the bell. "
"17970190","17970990"," I think that's possible."
"17971650","17973110"," The bulls don't have a lot of options."
"17974290","17977230"," The bulls are kind of in a corner right now. "
"17978010","17983030"," The runway is running out, so to speak, between now and next week."

"19114350","19121710"," You really want spy and all of tech and everything to kind of be a weekend or today."
"19122310","19128170"," I think for me that would be do-or-die for the bulls today or by Monday open. "
"19131970","19139570"," If we're going to not play out the second leg down of the market, I don't think time's on bull's"
"19139570","19140270"," sides right now."
"19145100","19146340"," And there's a big coming in right now."
"19146400","19146740"," Can't lie. "
"19147260","19151240"," The only issue with the bid that's coming in right now is there's some later dated calls."
"19151240","19153920"," There's some."
"19154920","19156860"," There are some puts falling off the market. "
"19157180","19157880"," That's a good one."
"19159240","19161220"," We do have lots of ERs coming up."
"19164760","19166940"," You know, so like sorry I had an all upstart question. "
"19168060","19170940"," We did a piece on this this morning right before market open."
"19171540","19174180"," If you're just joining us, you can always go back and watch the piece."
"19175080","19175660"," It was right at the start. "
"19175840","19178540"," We just went through where we are in the market for the month of February."
"19179320","19185760"," I'll trade the market up the month of February and protect yourself in case we reverse course, case"
"19185760","19187360"," the bull thesis doesn't work out."
"19188240","19193840"," And we end up trading backwards and down how to protect yourself if that happens. "
"19194500","19196020"," If the rug gets pulled."
"19196980","19201080"," We had something similar to this take place on the seventh."
"19201660","19204920"," I think of January or the fifth on Friday. "
"19206220","19210140"," We wound up like red barring it to hell on Monday."
"19212480","19213680"," Just be conscious of that."
"19213820","19214500"," I think we traded sideways. "
"19215720","19217980"," Into the clothes and that freedom that I can't remember exactly."
"19218740","19221020"," But that was a big move down on that Monday."
"19221360","19222420"," We traded sideways again. "
"19223300","19224220"," Big move down."
"19224800","19226660"," Just trapping bulls, trapping bulls."
"19227600","19228920"," Just be conscious of that. "
"19234050","19235270"," So you have the bullish thesis."
"19235450","19235930"," Say we're going up."
"19237010","19242330"," Take your longs, but protect yourself as we move up until we get into some positive gamma. "
"19242330","19252070"," Lots of"
"19252070","19253410"," volatility here on Tesla."
"19256370","19260410"," No real green skies above or blue skies above until we get past 950."
"19263330","19265030"," Same place for by the dip, 881. "
"19266910","19268210"," Nothing holding you up here."
"19269490","19271290"," It's 881 is the real support."
"19271750","19272850"," Real support right now. "
"19274090","19275110"," Real hard support is 881."
"19276970","19279010"," And resistance begins at 930."
"19280230","19282350"," It doesn't end until 950. "
"19282350","19284630"," But it's blue skies from 950 to 1000."
"19299500","19300870"," The spy is bleeding."
"19302150","19322450"," I will"
"19322450","19323590"," give a note though. "
"19324590","19330810"," The premium is wearing off on the put side of Monday."
"19331290","19334450"," Put some premium bleed."
"19336820","19340290"," Everyone is long into the day today and Monday. "
"19340290","19342150"," Bulls are all in."
"19360480","19361620"," Some bullish here."
"19362660","19365980"," Just a matter of timing when you buy in for being bullish in this close. "
"19366140","19368120"," This could be a pretty decent paying close."
"19371200","19377180"," There is premium bleed on the put side heading into Monday."
"19386320","19390580"," The dealers are hedging for us moving up into the close today. "
"19395370","19405390"," Say your price target into the close is 453.54. And"
"19405390","19412510"," if you can get a short covering after that number 453.54. If you might hit that number into the"
"19412510","19412810"," bell."
"19414550","19416070"," But it could come sooner."
"19418750","19421510"," And if you can hit 453.54 sooner. "
"19422250","19423010"," Then later."
"19423670","19428090"," It would not shock me to see a run up to 460 at the bell actually."
"19432380","19433600"," And being a bull. "
"19433880","19434520"," I'm a bull."
"19434840","19435620"," I'm a bearish right now."
"19435700","19436580"," But I am a bull. "
"19436860","19437500"," That's what I am."
"19439480","19440960"," That's what I want to see."
"19443640","19446560"," I want to see a run to 460 before end of day. "
"19446560","19453120"," I wanted to see it off the open today."
"19455900","19459780"," And you saw that market makers say no way to that."
"19461020","19461820"," This morning. "
"19462180","19462940"," They weren't allowing it."
"19468380","19470060"," But it should happen."
"19474010","19475350"," If it doesn't happen. "
"19475850","19476910"," If we sell off into the close."
"19478810","19480710"," It's not good for bulls."
"19482930","19484150"," But it looks like it's weighted. "
"19484290","19489770"," I'm looking at the options chains for today."
"19497600","19499420"," Everybody's on 450 C's now."
"19500940","19504900"," 450 C is now the popular strike. "
"19510110","19512090"," All of a sudden, everybody likes 450 C."
"19513690","19514990"," No one liked it this morning."
"19515990","19517770"," It was down into the 20's."
"19517970","19519290"," It was like 26 cents or something. "
"19522620","19525500"," It was as low as like 46 cents or something."
"19526380","19528340"," It went down like 26 cents."
"19529220","19531900"," Now worth bucking the quarter 500%. "
"19533560","19534760"," February 7th."
"19535280","19541680"," A lot of calls on 450 C as well."
"19546500","19547620"," February 9th. "
"19548040","19548960"," Start seeing some puts."
"19549800","19550880"," Nope, they just went away."
"19551780","19552640"," Over there, another gun. "
"19558940","19561440"," More calls on February 9th."
"19562800","19565100"," 220, or excuse me, 454 C."
"19570410","19571930"," Return pretty bullish here."
"19576730","19578010"," Especially a lot of puts to be closed. "
"19578310","19579010"," Say that's good to see."
"19581650","19583550"," Let's go through these and see where."
"19593470","19595170"," If there's any expansioning calls. "
"19609630","19611330"," Where are the bears hiding in here?"
"19622900","19625480"," They're still sticking around for the 18th."
"19625760","19627220"," Just repositioning slightly higher."
"19631640","19632100"," Stick it in moving. "
"19638880","19640960"," My microphone over for you guys."
"19646620","19648500"," Alright, Tesla."
"19650740","19651660"," That's the intent. "
"19651960","19654780"," I guess this is the point, right?"
"19655660","19657140"," You're going to make a break above."
"19672720","19675080"," This is a market defying moment, I think."
"19675980","19677020"," We're getting there. "
"19677820","19679260"," This week, we are getting there."
"19691070","19693370"," At least cyclically, we are right."
"19693510","19697090"," We're at the end of one cycle and we're looking for the next cycle in the market. "
"19700290","19702330"," So can we move up into the close of the question?"
"19768760","19769660"," Alright, give me a second here."
"19769720","19774500"," I'm going to go get a glass of whiskey and a hat for the end of the day today for"
"19774500","19774780"," you guys."
"19781720","19783040"," Yeah, I'm back on spy right now. "
"19792680","19796540"," If you want to know my position on the market, you can go back to this morning's video."
"19796840","19797900"," It's the beginning of this video."
"19798260","19798880"," You can pause it. "
"19799020","19806920"," Take the next 15 minutes or so."
"19806920","19807220"," I'll go back."
"19807380","19808860"," I have my whole view on the market right now. "
"19810740","19813480"," It's for the entire month of February."
"19816120","19817040"," You don't just pause."
"19817240","19817680"," You don't pause. "
"19817840","19819120"," You just scroll back in the video."
"19819740","19824060"," Then when you're done watching the beginning of the video, you can come back and watch the live"
"19824060","19828440"," stream at the three o'clock hour."
"19829460","19833560"," I think it takes 10 minutes, 15 minutes to see my view on where we are on the market. "
"19840580","19847940"," There are technical places to be bullish and technical places to be bearish and neutral."
"19857080","19858220"," I'll be right back."
"19981540","19987860"," There's an iron signing order that seeks to raise wages on infrastructure related jobs. "
"20055640","20061460"," Next up, we try crude futures from March settling 92 spot 31 barrel."
"20393240","20393880"," Tesla."
"20397420","20398940"," Look at Tesla. "
"20399760","20400680"," Look at spy."
"20403760","20406780"," I also want to note you guys hear me out there."
"20406880","20409740"," Can you guys hear me?"
"20410920","20412580"," I'm just going to get the camera back on again. "
"20417450","20418410"," Oh yeah, baby."
"20419230","20424570"," All right, I got a hat on with my dang lease."
"20425690","20426750"," Check those bad boys out. "
"20428050","20435830"," Apple reportedly looking at new low cost 5G iPhone and iPad to be launched in early March."
"20437230","20438130"," What was that again?"
"20439490","20446340"," Look at this Apple product event of the year."
"20447400","20451480"," Low cost 5G iPhone and iPad. "
"20452660","20455980"," They have a product launch event in March 2022."
"20457040","20461700"," You always remember that the Apple events are sell the news, but they are buy them early."
"20462580","20465400"," To sell them to people that think that it's not sell the news. "
"20466220","20467520"," Can you guys hear me right now?"
"20469420","20470280"," All right, sweet."
"20473560","20474460"," All right."
"20487990","20497900"," So we got Tesla moving up to 934.50. Spy is making its move higher now as well. "
"20503030","20503510"," It's 239."
"20506910","20507930"," Move this down."
"20511090","20512870"," More buyers and sellers on the spy. "
"20514370","20519970"," Looking to break through all of this traffic up in here."
"20529600","20533740"," Traffic is all this ice is all up into 455, but the price target at end of day is 460."
"20534620","20536440"," We might just trade up to this for 53. "
"20537000","20538440"," This is where I think the target is."
"20538520","20543340"," This ice right here was 453 area, 4338 somewhere in here."
"20544360","20548560"," And then I think we climbed the wall worry though, right up to 460 by the bell. "
"20549040","20550200"," That's my thought process."
"20552260","20553880"," That's what we do to the end of the day today."
"20554700","20568310"," So hopefully you guys are all long at some point or if not now, getting long, right?"
"20568310","20571630"," Ukraine war on Sunday or Saturday. "
"20575830","20577930"," We'll look at Tesla as well right now."
"20578250","20579870"," See if Tesla can actually break through."
"20581090","20583210"," Lots of lots of buyers on spy. "
"20583850","20584090"," Tesla."
"20584590","20585730"," Qcom has some buyers."

"20650450","20652470"," There's usually a run for Apple events."
"20655490","20658770"," You don't ever want to play the actual event itself, usually sell the news."
"20665970","20670010"," We'll look at Tesla now, see if it's is it loaded up, it's still loading up on Tesla right now,"
"20670130","20671810"," we'll check back on Tesla and see if it's rejected. "

"20732240","20736440"," None of the breaking news of this, but it should impact Apple."
"20737140","20738540"," People will want to buy it."
"20738880","20743300"," This is excellent to hear Amazon March 18, 330 C $1 million. "

"20847960","20854820"," In case we have a sell off into Monday and they've been trading up on Spy all day long."
"20857060","20865420"," My view is that the bulls only have so much time to get past that 460 number. "
"20867240","20868200"," They have to."
"20868380","20870700"," So they have to do it today or tomorrow or Monday."
"20873100","20877780"," They also if they can't get it done in cash market, they got to do it today. "
"20878580","20879480"," Let's say right."
"20879800","20885240"," And then you allow the futures traders to push it up and over to have a look above."
"20885500","20886620"," We still haven't looked above. "
"20888620","20893380"," We were rejected at 460 if you recall or just before it."

"20938520","20939500"," Don't knock out anything. "
"20941320","20942000"," All right."
"20942580","20945360"," So the bulls have to get up."
"20945520","20946440"," We've been here before. "
"20947100","20951980"," The bulls have to trade up to that 460."
"20952580","20953660"," They have to have the look above."
"20954100","20957600"," If they don't look above, then we're looking below. "
"20958840","20961840"," So that's kind of where we're at with the bull case."
"20963680","20966840"," And you can't really get bullish until we're above 460."
"20967160","20968360"," I don't know how many times I have to say it. "
"20969000","20971120"," No, I saw no spot gamma set at this morning."
"20971960","20974260"," So I don't know if you don't want to take my word for it."
"20974320","20975820"," You can take their word for it as well. "
"20977960","20978960"," I don't know you can look elsewhere."
"20979200","20982000"," I guess everybody I don't think everybody's on that same page."
"20982040","20983440"," I don't think I need to explain that to anybody. "
"20984300","20986420"," I think maybe just new traders maybe possibly."
"20987840","20990000"," I think bears are fully aware of this."
"20991940","20993260"," It's a 248. "
"20994680","20997240"," So I just grabbed whiskey, a bourbon."
"20998000","21007980"," So if you all want to grab a water or an orange candy bar, wacky tobacco, devil's lettuce."
"21008900","21009760"," Whatever it is you do. "
"21009840","21010120"," It's Friday."
"21010320","21015560"," We had a long week this week, told months and while all of January's been long, this week alone has"
"21015560","21015940"," been long."
"21020920","21026080"," Yeah, you really can't trade right now without being wrapped. "
"21029140","21035440"," Oh, I'm still I'm still messed up here with my, my, my, my, my chat box is all jacked up."
"21037220","21038040"," That's my dog."
"21038860","21039780"," You guys see my dog?"
"21040080","21040720"," Did I get on camera?"
"21041700","21042780"," Did my dog get on the camera?"
"21043740","21044460"," Thought it was lower. "
"21046480","21047160"," That's my boy."
"21047700","21048240"," One of my boys."
"21048400","21048900"," I've got two boys. "
"21049040","21051940"," I've got Ozzy Shepard and a border collie."
"21054380","21055120"," I got a bourbon."
"21058080","21059560"," Ozzy Shepard border collie. "
"21063430","21064770"," Let me see what you guys are doing here."
"21067390","21071330"," Yeah, I do want to make note that the heroin indicator is negative right now."
"21071730","21072650"," I should make that note. "
"21073070","21075110"," The heroin case has been negative all day long."
"21076550","21079270"," We see now that puts it on the way back from China."
"21079470","21079850"," You never know. "
"21080650","21083710"," MD loved that chip news from the White House."
"21084150","21084250"," Yeah."
"21085190","21086250"," Yeah, they need that. "
"21086530","21090070"," They need the chip makers need that that that squeaky wheel."
"21090650","21097270"," The whole point was politically we have, we need to, we need to make chips in other places in case"
"21097270","21097930"," we go to war, right?"
"21098390","21099470"," We cannot not have chips."
"21100230","21103910"," The fact that we don't make them here in the United States is just a disaster. "
"21104550","21105210"," It's national security."
"21105910","21107070"," Let's just call what it is, right?"
"21109070","21119070"," The Apple event is going to be important for selling to selling it, selling calls to FOMO dumbasses"
"21119070","21120830"," as we get closer to the Apple event."
"21121250","21124450"," So now would be the time to buy Apple calls for that. "
"21127230","21128270"," What's going on?"
"21129230","21131770"," I don't know what Lopez is."
"21136050","21136750"," Oh, thanks."
"21136950","21137390"," Thanks, Cream. "
"21137910","21138650"," Thanks like I'm a hat."
"21140470","21142250"," Okay, we're scrolling back through down here."
"21143490","21144570"," Die, snap, die. "
"21148950","21151630"," Hell yeah, gear trade."
"21152010","21152510"," Love that."
"21152670","21153630"," Do you guys ever go to gear trade?"
"21153870","21154670"," Look that shit up. "
"21156170","21158590"," Gear trade without a doubt."
"21158590","21159270"," Check it out."
"21160090","21162330"," All right, so I'm about to enter some calls again right now. "
"21164310","21165870"," So I'm going to enter some calls."
"21166250","21168670"," Probably somebody that's going to fade me."
"21169050","21169410"," That's okay. "
"21169410","21170610"," Fade away."
"21175390","21176170"," Fade away."
"21229250","21234250"," Okay, so I'm in some four 50 calls again. "
"21235550","21239130"," And I want to see if we can take this, if we can ride this up into the bell."

"21241790","21243750"," I'll keep that into the position if I need to. "
"21244170","21246010"," Even if we trade back I'll buy in."
"21247050","21248670"," I think we're going to go up into the bell."
"21250050","21253510"," I'm sitting on some puts for Monday as well. "
"21253850","21259370"," In case we have any kind of a gnarly volatile, mix some kind of rejection above that 452453."
"21260450","21262870"," There's like tons of sellers hiding up there."
"21263290","21264410"," Sneaky pizza or whatever. "
"21274000","21281190"," Let's see if we can have some sellers hiding up in here for sure."
"21282750","21284810"," Bears are just in wait right now."

"21312540","21313360"," I'll put on a seller. "
"21313560","21315020"," I've got some selling hats."
"21315320","21317660"," I'll get, I'll put a selling hat on next week, I promise."
"21318460","21319700"," That's why I get to force it to my clothes. "
"21319940","21321800"," I'm going to make me a bottle of rip and winkle."
"21322020","21322260"," Hell yeah."
"21322500","21323660"," Oh, rip and winkle. "
"21324260","21324740"," Love that shit."
"21325300","21326620"," My favorite is the nine year."
"21326720","21334600"," I've drank every bottle of rip and winkle and shockingly my favorite bottle of, is the only the"
"21334600","21334980"," nine year. "
"21335840","21338320"," The other stuff tastes to me like scotch."
"21340000","21340740"," Go on here."
"21344290","21345570"," Trying to get through this stuff. "
"21347270","21350330"," Whether my chat box is doing some, we are really weird shit."
"21350430","21354450"," I don't know if you guys are just typing really fast or if my chat box can't keep up."
"21359280","21361300"," Gear trade, gear, gear trade. "
"21361580","21365140"," G, it's a gamma echo, alpha, Romeo tango."

"21379270","21381990"," Drink, tell is making a good point. "
"21382230","21384330"," The vault trigger is 45250."
"21391950","21393290"," You guys want to see my dogs?"
"21394090","21394950"," I'll bring my dogs in here."
"21394950","21395290"," Hold on. "
"21425350","21426930"," I'm going to give my dog over here real quick."
"21429130","21429490"," Jack."
"21433680","21434380"," Very good boy. "
"21445690","21446690"," That's why, that's why."
"21451390","21452370"," It's a border collie."
"21453190","21454170"," This guy is from New Mexico. "
"21454910","21456410"," Bloom early, he's got blue eyes."
"21462430","21463410"," Henry, come here Henry."

"21476270","21477650"," That dog kills coyotes. "
"21477650","21483650"," It's a little out of here."
"21484070","21484750"," I'm going to mess up."
"21485470","21495350"," I got a border collie and a Aussie shepherd. "
"21502480","21504200"," Yeah, it's a natural security issue."
"21515280","21519840"," That's the other thing, gear trade is mostly not used underwear."
"21520440","21527800"," It's when they stop making, they do like the last stuff they sell for its return. "
"21529000","21531020"," But I don't really buy my underwear from them."
"21536720","21541340"," Negative hero indicator, you can just go online and it'll explain."
"21546500","21548440"," I'm getting really weird with my chat box here. "
"21560300","21560700"," Cheers."
"21573850","21577750"," Okay, Peton announces acquisition of rupees for the bucks, pulls a snap move."
"21584940","21585700"," Yeah, that's Henry. "
"21587600","21591260"," My dogs, all right, I finally made it down to the list."
"21597790","21604190"," So my, my, I bought, yeah, I did buy the, well, no, I got a good, good dog story for"
"21604190","21604370"," you."
"21604370","21607370"," So I'm long right now, long and strong. "
"21607910","21608910"," I got two good stories."
"21609110","21611010"," We're listening to trade the news."
"21612350","21613390"," You want to hear a quick story?"
"21613690","21613910"," Probably not. "
"21614110","21614770"," Probably want to hear other shit."
"21615190","21617870"," Anyways, I'll break up the, the, uh, Anani."
"21620070","21628670"," I, uh, wanted a, I wanted a border collie for my first daughter and I couldn't find one. "
"21628770","21631810"," I went to all the shelters everywhere, searched high and low for one couldn't find one."
"21632330","21634890"," All the shelters had, uh, uh, fighting dogs."
"21635650","21639010"," I was living in the West, not the West Coast, but the West. "
"21639930","21642210"," And there's a lot of dog fighting out there."
"21643150","21648250"," So when you get to the shelters and stuff, you don't often find, uh, dog that you really want for"
"21648250","21649970"," your kids, protect your kids and all that kind of stuff."
"21650490","21651750"," So I ended up buying him. "
"21651890","21654050"," He cost me, I think, 500 bucks or something."
"21655170","21659210"," I didn't want to pay for a dog, but I did get him from an actual working ranch, not a"
"21659210","21660190"," popular or anything like that."
"21660750","21662310"," Had a drive out in the middle of nowhere. "
"21662710","21663870"," It was like six hour drive."
"21664090","21664610"," I'm going to go get him."
"21666150","21668450"," And, uh, I have a ranchers in my family. "
"21669230","21673090"," So I knew, knew, you know, I knew who to get him from and all this stuff."
"21673430","21674190"," Actual working dog."
"21674850","21675750"," I faddened him up though. "
"21677310","21683050"," Um, then the second one though, I would, I donate to, I donate money to dog shelters."
"21684890","21693670"," Um, and, they were going to put my other dog down the Henry dog."
"21694590","21695490"," The Austin Shepherd. "
"21695650","21702070"," They were going to kill him at a no kill shelter because he was left alone with his owner and"
"21702070","21703050"," his owner passed away."
"21703830","21705810"," And he was left alone with the dog."
"21709430","21713290"," You know, he was left alone with the dog and no one wanted him. "
"21713430","21715750"," No one wanted to adopt him in the story behind it."
"21715770","21718530"," Nobody wanted to take him because he kind of got hungry, right?"
"21718530","21722730"," Uh, and he wasn't a pay, he wasn't a, he was a difficult dog."
"21723410","21725870"," But I adopted him because they wanted to get killed. "
"21726910","21729710"," And he's been the perfect companion for my other dog."
"21730630","21732090"," And, uh, he's vicious."
"21732710","21735750"," Like, I used to hunt down coyotes, all kinds of craziness. "
"21737130","21738590"," Oh, my daughter's name, both dogs."
"21739190","21741230"," So they've got like, they're named Jack and Henry."
"21742010","21744770"," Uh, they don't, I was like, you want cool names for the dogs?"
"21745010","21746990"," And they just wanted like, Jack and Henry. "
"21747510","21747910"," Okay."
"21748350","21749310"," So that's what we went with."
"21750830","21751950"," So we've got Jack and Henry. "
"21753610","21755570"," And we've got one cat, that's name is Kitty."
"21755590","21757490"," One hour and an hour and an hour and a US cash equity close."
"21757770","21758410"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"21758510","21766250"," He was finished at 1.9% for the two year at 1.32. 1.32. That was up 125"
"21766250","21768990"," as we pushed towards the close, the S&P up 48."
"21769910","21774570"," And then as I composite up 303, still being driven by Amazon shares, which are holding on to gains"
"21774570","21776090"," of more than 15%."
"21776090","21782110"," And 2000 after being soft earlier in the session, is now close to 1% is. "
"21785590","21786570"," Burr, baby burr."
"21794890","21795210"," Boxers."
"21796130","21797010"," I was in the army. "
"21802780","21803600"," I didn't buy."
"21803880","21805540"," First of all, the first one I bought, I had to have a choice."
"21806340","21807640"," I had to buy the dang dog. "
"21808220","21811080"," And I have a freaking choice or I adopted with a fee."
"21812200","21815720"," But the second one I saved his ass from sure from from death."
"21817200","21818680"," The second one was going to die. "
"21819800","21820900"," So I saved his life."
"21822540","21825740"," And he's the biggest pain in the ass, but I love him."
"21833080","21834520"," Amazon got a premium to the finish. "
"21837440","21839820"," My shout out enough calls for you guys to take."
"21841440","21842720"," You guys following along?"
"21847000","21848940"," I know I'm not supposed to say that, Quinn."
"21849940","21851220"," I thought the dogs are family. "
"21854280","21855960"," Yeah, don't play dead around that dog."
"21858860","21862640"," The army don't wear no boxers."
"21862940","21863480"," I was in the army. "
"21864100","21865280"," You don't wear no underwear."
"21866360","21867060"," I freeball it."
"21868180","21868920"," Come on. "
"21868920","21871320"," You don't wear underwear."
"21873380","21874920"," Great dog for the zombie apocalypse."
"21878060","21878660"," Never. "
"21878980","21880420"," Second dog's not aggressive at all."
"21882160","21884260"," Second dog is a hunter."
"21885520","21893330"," So he's aggressive towards like coyotes, stuff like that. "
"21895390","21898370"," Any kind of small to medium sized animal."
"21899350","21900410"," He's all over it."
"21901970","21903750"," But not aggressive at all towards kids. "
"21903750","21904610"," Very protective."
"21904970","21907290"," Aussie shepherds, but they're more aggressive than a shepherd."
"21907950","21913930"," Aussie shepherds are more aggressive towards small animals than border collies. "
"21914450","21915390"," It's really weird."
"21915510","21917450"," They're close, but not exactly the same dog."
"21926420","21927600"," He bleaches about his. "
"21931100","21932320"," Yeah, you freeball it."
"21932640","21933560"," I was in the army."
"21933780","21935220"," Once I stopped wearing underwear in the army. "
"21936300","21937140"," That was it."
"21937780","21938620"," Never again."
"21941520","21947960"," You guys should see me in a pair of ripped cut ripped jeans with a thread or bear. "
"21948200","21949620"," Am I like my ball sack hangs out?"
"21951680","21953100"," Like a 1970s guy would do."
"21954040","21957080"," You guys ever see pictures of the men from the 1970s?"
"21957600","21959040"," They'd have their left not hanging out."
"21960980","21963740"," All right, so we're moving up to a volatility zone right up here. "
"21964000","21965240"," We can't be conscious of this."
"21966000","21970360"," This is a place to use caution as we move higher here."
"21970540","21974340"," Could see a quick rejection as we move higher here. "
"21974740","21977120"," We do have some UVXY puts coming in."
"21977820","21979880"," I'm going to hold fast here for right now."
"21981240","21982780"," I think we just straight higher. "
"21983200","21985300"," We're going to start squeezing shorts at this point."
"21986920","21989040"," Hope you guys are making money right now."

"22020480","22021080"," Oh, let me get Jack."
"22021680","22022220"," All right, boys. "
"22024360","22027880"," Everybody's outside having a blast and my dogs don't want to be left inside the house."
"22028840","22031120"," We are rejecting slightly here."
"22031480","22033300"," I'm probably going to take some profit here briefly. "
"22037840","22038840"," Yeah, I'm going to take some profit."
"22046730","22049730"," So we're right at the top of the of the bear channel."

"22062990","22063710"," Where is Jack?"

"22070990","22075300"," Jack, this is what happens on a Friday at my house."
"22076100","22077000"," We have wife and kids. "
"22077280","22078480"," They're all outside partying."
"22080340","22082480"," And dogs aren't out with them."
"22083120","22083760"," Sorry about that. "
"22086580","22088760"," So I just told some spy calls."
"22088940","22091420"," We're at the top of the channel on spy."
"22092020","22100380"," This is the channel we've been trading in basically for going way back to January 21st. "
"22102140","22111420"," And if we are, excuse me, sorry about all this right now, I'm professional."
"22115180","22124580"," If we can break above 450 to 15 here, I'll pick up another long here to 460 into the bell."
"22129790","22134210"," I want to see a break above this 450 to 12 or so. "
"22135530","22137090"," I'll take another long here."
"22145080","22147340"," Yes, the 450 sees 10 times."
"22147640","22148560"," Yes, they did. "
"22150660","22152560"," That was a call out this morning, right?"
"22162940","22164520"," I'm trading those all day long."
"22166800","22170380"," We're just looking for I want to see it get over this white line right here."
"22170640","22171400"," This I will. "
"22171620","22173040"," We could post this, I guess."
"22173180","22174640"," But this is the channel that we've been in."
"22174680","22180120"," And this is the top of the channel we've been in since going back. "
"22181340","22185840"," So I don't know, 15 sessions or so 10, 15 sessions, maybe that'd be less."
"22187660","22189260"," Well, wait for a break above this."
"22189260","22190380"," And then I'm going to jump back in. "
"22190780","22192020"," I want to see his breakthrough here."

"22350860","22351900"," They're probably dead."
"22356020","22356920"," Yeah, they're dead. "
"22357840","22358540"," They're still dead."
"22359820","22360640"," They're worth a penny."
"22385720","22386940"," 460 is dead. "

"22501730","22504290"," I'm not joking about climbing that wall into the clothes today."
"22504810","22508710"," There's a fair chance that we climb the wall right 2460 by close."
"22509070","22509830"," It's on the table. "
"22510270","22514550"," I'm not saying it's going to happen, but there's a fair chance that we climb the wall."

"22519870","22520990"," We have a quick pullback up here. "
"22521630","22523110"," We could still climb the wall already."
"22523930","22528010"," Like one green bar straight up into 460 into the bell."
"22529530","22534390"," A better target is probably 455, but you can't say that it's not on the table. "
"22542090","22545050"," We're almost at the price target for the day of 453."
"22545050","22549930"," If we can nail that 460, it'd be a huge bull move."
"22550570","22550790"," Huge. "

"22611340","22612500"," Taking the market long."
"22614040","22618820"," We're going to make enough money that it doesn't matter if you buy a hedge."
"22619420","22620260"," Does that make sense?"
"22620760","22624100"," You should have that conviction in your trading. "
"22625480","22627560"," So it doesn't matter what your hedge is."
"22628480","22630660"," You're buying a hedge or protecting your trade."
"22631880","22632440"," Right?"
"22632740","22634560"," These are built into spreads. "
"22635140","22640780"," These are built into any kind of trading strategy out there other than just holding calls or puts."
"22641420","22643360"," Like buying a call or buying a put."
"22644420","22649100"," You have to be able to hedge your trades and your trades have to be able to make money for"

"22677640","22680060"," You will last longer as a trader."
"22684520","22688370"," Right, right over here."
"22703830","22704770"," Shouldn't be any orders. "
"22704930","22707910"," I'm looking more for looking more for a short covering."
"22708070","22714610"," If we can break through this for $43.54, if we can break up there."
"22715650","22716570"," I'm looking for short covering. "
"22721720","22723500"," Okay, Tesla, let's get Tesla real quick."

"22744500","22745540"," Be careful with Tesla here."
"22745900","22751700"," I got to say this day traders know to pick it up at 881 and sell it at 933."
"22752020","22752840"," I'm not saying it can't go higher. "
"22752840","22756020"," I'm just saying this is brutal up in here on Tesla."
"22756840","22757940"," We'll go to shop next."
"22758700","22759400"," Get out. "
"22760440","22761480"," Hold on a second here."
"22761860","22765340"," I got to take care of my stuff here."
"22770790","22775350"," There is some premium leaking out of spy calls right now. "
"22780810","22781730"," Just heads up."
"22791180","22792220"," We'll look up shop."
"22793360","22794780"," Let's see if we get a rejection here. "
"22801830","22803750"," Let's see if we can bounce off this."
"22803970","22806450"," We're now up and above the trading channel."
"22806850","22808890"," Hopefully we get a bounce here on this 451. "

"23184260","23189780"," You guys rock period and nothing else to say on that topic other than, uh, you're better than a lot"
"23189780","23189960"," of people."
"23189960","23191080"," You guys are there once too. "
"23191360","23196880"," And that's how this started for me was when I first started trading, I wound up."
"23197740","23204740"," I wound up buying, buying all the classes, I bought all the, the secret codes and I paid, you know,"
"23204840","23207800"," 1000 bucks here a month and I paid 600 dollars there for a month."
"23208020","23209860"," I paid for every, every flow service. "
"23210660","23211380"," Uh, you name it."
"23211540","23211980"," You name it."
"23212040","23212580"," I paid for it. "
"23212880","23218760"," I tried everything and then I figured out that the cacophony of social media on top of all that."
"23218820","23221920"," I wasn't getting actionable stuff that I could use, uh, dumbing."
"23222020","23226560"," I needed to dumb down my trading, dumb down my style so that I could actually be profitable, make"
"23226560","23229700"," money, uh, be successful at this. "
"23230700","23233220"," And that's kind of weird."
"23233320","23241180"," I'm not showing any, yeah, I'm not showing, it's my, uh, my mini feeds not on inside my, my"
"23241180","23242880"," streamlabs, my streamlabs sucks."
"23243360","23243700"," Sorry. "
"23244340","23250640"," But that's why you guys know how important it is, uh, that there's a place for people to come that"
"23250640","23251560"," were active, right?"
"23252120","23255820"," I've paid for rooms like 1000 dollars for a room where, you know, guys doesn't show up."
"23256060","23258100"," Guys there once a week, twice a week."
"23258880","23268810"," Um, so I just, I hope this is helping you out there as"
"23268810","23271750"," an investor, as a trader, especially this market right here. "
"23272170","23275030"," I commented last night that this is going to shake a lot of people out."
"23275130","23276270"," This market's going to shake people out."
"23277590","23281150"," It's going to, it's going to kill bears, bulls, traders, doesn't matter. "
"23281830","23285530"," This is some, I haven't seen trading like this in, in years."
"23286950","23294670"," So I just wanted to thank all of you and appreciate you being kind to me too."
"23295430","23296450"," Uh, you guys are really nice. "
"23298230","23299310"," That's important too, right?"
"23299430","23300170"," Be civil with each other."
"23300350","23301670"," We can make fun of each other, all that kind of stuff."
"23302130","23304030"," Uh, but you know, stick around. "
"23304470","23308910"," If you're, if you're coming into midstream sometimes and you don't know where we actually are, just"
"23308910","23313270"," turn around in the background when you're trading all day long, just put a, put on like a podcast,"
"23313750","23317110"," just play the audio in the background and, uh, start following along."
"23317270","23320430"," You can open up discord, uh, some banging traders in there."
"23321650","23324190"," Bangers, uh, putting out some banging content. "
"23325430","23328150"," There's no like you have to follow, uh, Captain Jim James."
"23328630","23330330"," I'm not that kind of a guy."
"23330850","23334930"," You guys, you guys, I expect all of you guys to do your own stuff and I want to follow"
"23334930","23336250"," you guys in somewhere you're doing. "
"23336890","23342110"," This isn't all about, uh, like leadership is a weird thing, right?"
"23342910","23345990"," Um, there's like the dictators and I'm not a dictator."
"23346550","23347750"," No need to be a dictator."
"23348250","23351610"," Um, none, none of that should ever works out. "
"23353110","23353550"," Right."
"23353650","23361350"," Lead by example, lead by who you are and, uh, and everything else falls from that."
"23362470","23364210"," So I just want to say that to you guys specifically. "
"23364250","23366930"," So I want to give a chairs to anyone that supports this channel."
"23367330","23370430"," I don't care if you're supporting with a like or a subscribe or just interacting."
"23370910","23375430"," If you're supporting by helping somebody out, whatever your part is, don't feel like you can't ask"
"23375430","23376850"," for information either. "
"23377150","23377250"," Right."
"23377490","23380070"," Go to the discord and be like, I don't know how to buy a stock."
"23380610","23381630"," Like, I don't care what it is. "
"23381810","23385610"," I don't care if you've been a traitor for sometimes I have to go back and do basic trading"
"23385610","23386630"," strategies for myself."
"23387170","23388050"," So I don't lose sight."
"23388710","23392950"," Uh, so I used to be, I used to get really complicated and how I would trade, how I would"
"23392950","23394710"," invest or complicate things. "
"23394910","23396650"," And I, I started losing money."
"23397070","23402270"," Like I would like make hundreds of thousands of dollars and lose it all because I thought I was too"
"23402270","23402910"," smart, right?"
"23403090","23404070"," Too smart for school."
"23404770","23407510"," And, uh, sometimes you go back to basics and that helps you. "
"23407690","23409550"," You know, you watch a guy, you're, you're a goat."
"23410190","23411610"," You know, you look at Brian Watt, right?"
"23412310","23413690"," That guy keeps shit simple."
"23413950","23418990"," I almost made a post about him last night on Twitter because, uh, one day the market fell with no"
"23418990","23421610"," news and he was like, what the fuck's going on?"
"23422030","23426130"," And I realized he had the insight to know that he knows all the events that are going on. "
"23426710","23429450"," But he knows what the impact should be throughout the course of the day."
"23429630","23432470"," He trusts though his trading, uh, style."
"23432690","23434170"," He trusts where the market should go. "
"23434390","23436490"," That actually worked out yesterday as well in the market."
"23436690","23438930"," You saw Amazon sell off on Thursday night."
"23439350","23440630"," You saw it sell off on Friday. "
"23441030","23444310"," There's no way Amazon was selling off, uh, into their ER."
"23444430","23447530"," No matter what the ER was unless it was something really doom and gloom."
"23448010","23451950"," And if you know that, if you know how to trade, you know to spot that stuff, those are key"
"23451950","23452770"," moments in the market. "
"23452990","23455450"," That's when traders say, well, why didn't we sell off?"
"23455450","23457450"," Or why did it didn't work this time?"
"23457450","23459490"," Why did they change the news and its impact this time?"
"23459730","23462170"," That's because you're wrapped around the market."
"23462830","23464810"," You know, so I wanted to talk."
"23464990","23469110"," I didn't, I didn't like that post last night about Brian Watt, but he's a simple trader. "
"23469650","23470590"," That guy makes a lot of money."
"23472190","23474550"," So my point to you is a stick around with this group."
"23474650","23478790"," This group knows what they're doing, especially the core group that's been around for the past"
"23478790","23482290"," year, year and a half, just before this channel has evolved into what it is. "
"23482550","23486370"," We started out with just doing a daily brief typed out every morning on Twitter."
"23486770","23491330"," So I have two, three page, my plan, what I'm going to trade today, and it doesn't mean you trade"
"23491330","23494810"," with me or anything, but it was, this is my concept of what I think is going to happen in"
"23494810","23495330"," the market today."
"23496170","23501630"," It's evolved into this and it's evolved into a core group of traders and investors that have been"
"23501630","23503090"," sticking around here for over a year. "
"23503470","23506230"," So stick around, you can trade against it."
"23506290","23508130"," If you don't like it, there's other places for you, right?"
"23508370","23510370"," The key part about this is that it's free."
"23510770","23514050"," You guys, this is just free out there at all times, right?"
"23514790","23517690"," Go buy a $600 membership somewhere. "
"23517890","23521730"," See if that membership is working for you, because for me, they didn't work."
"23522250","23524070"," Oftentimes, there was always some, right?"
"23524630","23528270"," The alpha wasn't there, the head trader wasn't there."
"23528290","23530090"," 30 minutes now, 30 minutes to the cash close. "
"23531570","23535850"," You know, you have assholes like people that thought, they're like blocking the roosters and all"
"23535850","23536390"," that kind of shit."
"23536710","23538250"," Or you ask a question, people make funny."
"23538490","23539370"," They don't take you in. "
"23539450","23541090"," There's all kinds of issues, right, that I always had."
"23541650","23547190"," So my thought was to just launch this, to just kind of cut through the bullshit."
"23548450","23550670"," So I just want to say thanks to all of you guys out there. "
"23551530","23552550"," Have a toast with you."
"23552790","23553990"," I'm not reading the chat or anything right now."
"23554030","23555990"," I just want to say thanks to all of you out there here. "
"23556490","23560470"," Chindau, if you've got water and apple, whatever you got, you're riding a bike right now, you're"
"23560470","23561850"," working on drink cup of coffee."
"23562350","23563210"," Cheers to you."
"23563610","23565430"," I hope that you guys haven't gotten blown out. "
"23565450","23566350"," I hope that you're making money."
"23566590","23568130"," I hope that you're getting tools."
"23568670","23571230"," I hope they're able to survive this market and make money. "
"23571410","23572370"," So that's what's coming to you."
"23572410","23573570"," At the end of the day, that's what it's all about."
"23574310","23580450"," So I'm up in a bearable trader investor, while you turning your money into more money for yourself,"
"23580690","23580710"," right?"
"23580830","23584830"," You can take care of yourself, family or friends, whatever it is that your goals are. "
"23585170","23586270"," Okay, so here's to you."
"23586870","23587230"," Cheers."
"23592400","23592840"," Woo. "
"23604540","23606120"," Doesn't kind of bearish on the Spyro quick."
"23606360","23606800"," Just heads up."
"23607680","23608660"," Clearly a reversal. "
"23609880","23612820"," Bears beginning getting all fired up right now."
"23614940","23615380"," 331."
"23615380","23616720"," Bears want their reversal. "
"23618180","23619320"," At least the dip too, right?"
"23619500","23620020"," Just give me a dip."
"23620240","23621900"," Bears are saying just give me that dip down here."
"23622360","23623840"," You got futures traders inside the chat. "
"23624380","23625820"," Feel like there's no bid on 460."
"23625820","23626760"," We ain't going there."
"23627200","23627580"," Right?"
"23627740","23629020"," No way in how we're going to 460. "
"23635640","23636520"," Cheers to all of you out there."
"23644050","23650030"," I don't care."
"23650190","23653170"," I'd rather make 250 a day every day. "
"23655050","23655890"," Every day."
"23656390","23658230"," That guy doesn't have to have a job."
"23658950","23659930"," That guy doesn't have to. "
"23660530","23663110"," You know, you got all you guys know something out there, okay?"
"23663590","23667170"," That Joe Harper, not Joe Harper, that Brian Watt taught me something special, okay?"
"23668330","23672650"," Is that if you are able to get good at this, you don't have to be smart to do this."
"23673010","23677790"," And if anything, if you're a smart person, sometimes it's better for you to dumb your shit down to"
"23677790","23678110"," make money."
"23678590","23681510"," I got to tell you something, you guys, there's a ton of people out there. "
"23681630","23685710"," There's a ton, millions of people out there that don't know about investing, don't know about"
"23685710","23688070"," trading, and they work jobs, right?"
"23688250","23693650"," They got, if you've been blessed with a gift of being able to learn how to trade and make a"
"23693650","23698050"," living for yourself that will pay you more than anything else that you could possibly do."
"23698150","23702050"," Most things that you could possibly do, more than attorneys, more than dentists and doctors,"
"23702230","23706830"," believe it or not, engineers, you can make a very good living doing this."
"23708150","23713650"," And if you get good at this, right, no matter what your background is, your education is, you can"
"23713650","23717570"," succeed and make a good life for yourself. "
"23717950","23719290"," You can make that difference."
"23719590","23720310"," That's not a lie."
"23721170","23721910"," That is true. "
"23722430","23727610"," Do we do wash out 90% of people that trade for a multitude of reasons, but if you can"
"23727610","23732130"," learn the right tools, if you can, you know, come back again and again and again and again and"
"23732130","23736210"," again, right, you work your regular job and you just keep trying at it every single week."
"23736650","23739550"," I'm telling you, if you lose enough money, I've lost."
"23741590","23742810"," I've lost more money. "
"23743130","23747090"," I lost so much money for making mistakes."
"23747210","23754610"," It's taken me years to become a profitable trader years, but it's worth, it was worth every one of"
"23754610","23755010"," those years."
"23756590","23761210"," Because once you turn that corner, it becomes, it becomes profitable. "
"23761650","23765910"," It saves, it saves, or it gives you the ability to do the things that you want to do."
"23766870","23768130"," Live life that you want to live."
"23768970","23772050"," You can still be, you can still be a doctor, you can volunteer your time. "
"23773550","23776710"," Whatever it is that you do, that you enjoy, you can then enjoy."
"23782260","23782840"," I'm serious."
"23783880","23785640"," I've lost so much money. "
"23788100","23794180"," It took five years, it took five years to just become competent."
"23796360","23797840"," Just become competent."
"23799160","23806800"," And then to make consistent money, another five years, it was consistent, like no more blowing up"
"23806800","23807100"," accounts. "
"23807560","23810200"," I haven't blown up an account in years now."
"23812020","23813720"," So just think of that, okay?"
"23814600","23815960"," Think about what awaits you."
"23816360","23817340"," Know that it's going to be hard. "
"23817560","23820400"," Nothing's easy, but you found this."
"23820620","23825460"," However you found this, I don't know how you found not me, but you found this thing, right, this"
"23825460","23826060"," trading thing."
"23826800","23831400"," If you can master it over time, even if you're blowing up accounts, they're like 500 bucks, 1000"
"23831400","23835800"," bucks, $100,000, multi-hundred thousand dollars. "
"23837320","23840540"," Eventually you're going to learn not to blow them up anymore."
"23841460","23843200"," Protect your money, grow your money."
"23844180","23848760"," There's no magic sauce, there's no like, like all those guys out there that are selling scam"
"23848760","23853860"," programs and the secret sauce this and the secret sauce that, there's no secret sauce to it. "
"23854460","23860720"," Just stick around with people that make money in this market, learn from them how they make money"
"23862860","23867900"," and try to take at least some tools from them that fit you, and then you move on to the"
"23867900","23874100"," next guy, and you take tools from that guy, right, that woman or whomever, and you say, I like what"
"23874100","23876520"," they do, right?"
"23877020","23878280"," I like what that person does."
"23878520","23880520"," I like what that person highlights, this person highlights."
"23880520","23884400"," It's not like it's only going to be me that fits you, right?"
"23884580","23893160"," Find different traders out there, different investors wearing when they can help you, and you make"
"23893160","23898420"," your own little tool basket, your box of tools, and you'll find out what works for you, for you to"
"23898420","23901040"," make money, right?"
"23903640","23909320"," And then one day, trust me, you're going to feel like you have to help other people because the the"
"23909320","23914420"," the the the the shit pile you have to wade through to get the actual good information is stacked"
"23914420","23917220"," like 10 feet high behind a lot of bullshit. "
"23920090","23924870"," I'm not going to go into the rant as to why some of that information's out there, but it's not"
"23924870","23925430"," all nefarious."
"23926250","23929770"," I think that's I think that some of that information you don't know who's actually behind saying it"
"23929770","23933330"," or why they're saying it for the multitude of reasons."
"23935490","23936610"," Let me get caught up in that. "
"23937690","23939930"," Hey, I just my so many many feet just pop back up."
"23940590","23943110"," DJN, thank you very much for supporting the channel."
"23944090","23946410"," John A, thank you for supporting the channel. "
"23947410","23949430"," P options, thanks for supporting the channel."

"23954470","23955430"," No worry, Lepis. "
"23956010","23956690"," You'd be in the red."
"23956830","23957570"," We can get in the green, brother."
"23957810","23958410"," Don't worry about it. "
"23958470","23959010"," We'll get in the green."
"23960490","23961850"," I have to do some some things though."
"23961950","23966390"," I have to do some more specific how to protect your money, how to trade your money, how to invest"

"24025730","24028970"," It might sell off slightly and then rip into the close."
"24029630","24032050"," We're getting a little weak here right now on the spy."
"24033530","24040210"," I think it's more a little bit weak here in the spy right now. "

"24051330","24055390"," Under normal circumstances, we've been up all day long with a negative heroin indicator. "

"24061070","24063830"," I want you to know that into this close, into Monday. "

"24068010","24071930"," It could also be selling puts where we are right now."
"24072630","24074730"," The heroin indicator is not foolproof. "
"24075630","24079390"," So take that into consideration as we head into Monday, right?"
"24079490","24082710"," It's $3.39. Sometimes if you're a bully, just you're just cashing."

"24244030","24245090"," We should have already known that, right?"
"24245390","24246190"," 900 is kind of resistance. "
"24246770","24249250"," You want to see if we bashed above Shopify."
"24250590","24251850"," We're in the clothes right now."
"24251910","24252370"," We got 342. "
"24253070","24254610"," Now I'm looking at run right now."
"24255610","24257710"," Like, do I sell run right where we're at?"
"24258970","24260210"," Where do I stay and run?"

"24262370","24263010"," That's what I hate about. "
"24263470","24270030"," I'm going to hate about trading options on stocks because you got to stay in them."
"24271550","24272430"," What's going on here?"
"24276080","24277080"," That looks like it's not."
"24278060","24281100"," Yeah, there's no, there's no Shopify. "
"24282000","24285740"," Look for, you guys looking for a bottom or by the dip on Shop?"

"24289520","24290340"," That's where it's at."
"24291160","24292460"," Nice support though at 845. "
"24293320","24294180"," Pretty good support here."

"24335940","24337500"," That looks like a Facebook to me, right?"
"24337800","24341640"," Not a Facebook, but they're just looking to sell."
"24353560","24358500"," I might grab it on a set of calls here on the spy into the bell."
"24358700","24360520"," So, 344 is the danger zone, right?"
"24362500","24364220"," Do we sell off into clothes on Friday?"
"24368030","24370030"," We have a hard rejection at 4278. "
"24371290","24374530"," Are we going to close the weak negative on the market?"
"24377960","24380580"," This is a key point for the market here, right?"
"24380860","24383340"," We're entering the, we reject it at the volatility zone."
"24385040","24386660"," Just firmly rejected here."
"24387580","24388960"," Do we close the weak out?"
"24389120","24389360"," Rejected. "
"24391400","24392400"," That's a big question."
"24396940","24398400"," Bear is telling you no."
"24400820","24402520"," Bear is going to tell you this is a bull trap. "
"24408600","24411160"," The runway is running out for bulls."
"24421610","24424670"," So, do you wait for the clothes by the dip for a Monday gap up?"
"24425310","24428270"," What kind of news do we need for a Monday gap up?"
"24429850","24431830"," Do we just gap up for the hell of it?"
"24432910","24434930"," Is that why we're just gapping up just because of the hell of it?"
"24437390","24439130"," Tell me a quick thesis on chat."
"24449960","24451900"," I think they do close the green on the weak though. "
"24452260","24454780"," So, bear Monday, 449 open."
"24456680","24457500"," Future straight is here."
"24457640","24459040"," You aren't getting 460 today. "
"24459480","24460240"," Thanks, Spark, you're saying something."
"24461220","24464340"," Spark, do you think there's a chance of 460 in the Monday that you'd push it up"
"24465650","24478070"," as"
"24478070","24478730"," a future week is green?"
"24481770","24483510"," Don't think Monday gap up."
"24484030","24486610"," Today was a great day to add puts, in my opinion. "
"24487330","24488210"," Fair point, David."
"24488430","24489410"," Yeah, I got some puts out there."
"24489850","24495350"," You know what, I'm gonna have to add some in for averaging for Monday in case we do sell off. "
"24495810","24501470"," I am concerned a ton of people are bearish on Monday gap up because it's Monday."
"24501770","24508590"," I am concerned with, so I was in the army and they love starting shit over the weekend."
"24510590","24514530"," Love starting shit over the weekend, never during a Monday. "
"24515390","24519770"," The military is gonna start some shit typically on the weekend, not always, but typically."
"24520930","24525770"," Like, you know, it may make a hit or something during the week because timing, but the military"
"24525770","24527210"," loves doing the shit over the weekend."
"24528370","24536350"," It gives time for digestion or if some shit pops off, it's typically on the weekend. "
"24539830","24544090"," In the one hour chart, we're still making lower highs, high, lower lows."
"24545810","24547370"," So we have an inside day, is that what you're saying?"
"24547510","24549110"," I haven't looked to see if we have an inside day yet or not."
"24550950","24552330"," Looks like an inside day, doesn't it?"
"24553790","24555570"," I haven't even looked yet to see if it's an inside day. "
"24559990","24560310"," Yeah."
"24560310","24560410"," Yeah."
"24562770","24566050"," Oh, no, do we go a tick above by chance of you?"
"24566270","24569190"," Do we break yesterday's high or tick above?"
"24578880","24580480"," Oh, it's all my opinions in the bottle. "
"24581240","24581960"," That's Robert."
"24582320","24582980"," Cheers, Robert."
"24587280","24587960"," Yeah, the call. "

"24591900","24592180"," Good job. "
"24594140","24595120"," Marking close names."
"24595360","24595960"," Nothing should happen."
"24595960","24600820"," Then I side modestly to buy side about 300 million to buy S&P market and close names. "
"24606930","24610190"," Russia does military actions during Olympics back in tomorrow."
"24613460","24615760"," Yeah, I agree with that on the 10 year being up Devin."
"24618320","24619680"," They're kind of the machines, baby. "
"24622640","24624400"," We did not break yesterday's high."
"24624540","24624840"," Looks close."
"24625020","24631380"," I didn't check close enough, but yeah, and key three days of lower lows, lower highs. "
"24631900","24635960"," Yeah, I thought about those three, those three lower days myself too."

"24673100","24674600"," You hope that it holds right here in the spy?"
"24675100","24676760"," Looks like we're selling off of the clothes like they're saying."
"24676940","24678620"," No fucking way what they're saying."
"24681720","24685820"," Let me check a few minutes to get 10 minutes left. "
"24685820","24692440"," I'm going to see anyone loading up on puts for Monday is a good question."

"24699010","24699630"," Just heads up. "
"24700890","24701970"," There's stepping in."

"24710420","24712140"," That's still not a lot of premium over. "
"24715220","24717400"," Still not a lot of premium over on Monday."
"24720420","24722040"," On the bare side of things."

"24738280","24745750"," I want to be looking to see if like we go from 133,000 contracts. "
"24746170","24747630"," We're up to 134,000 now."
"24748030","24751170"," Someone just bought a thousand contracts on 450 C."
"24752130","24753790"," For February 7th I'm looking at."
"24756150","24760470"," I want to see if that goes up into the bell right now last 10 minutes or so. "
"24761850","24771250"," As I just see banks sneak in quietly on one side of the other on a Friday because they know"
"24771250","24771890"," more than we do."

"24801250","24802630"," Yeah, it is far from VWAP. "
"24803350","24806780"," I love spot gamma."
"24807700","24808420"," I love it."
"24808540","24811020"," It's it's one of the integral tools that I use. "
"24812680","24815360"," I use traditional charting methods."
"24816620","24819360"," Then I couple that with some profile market profile."
"24820360","24822240"," On top of that I layer spot gamma. "
"24824100","24825500"," A sprinkle of LA wave."
"24828100","24831240"," Usually I have to listen to four or five different LA waivers."
"24832480","24833400"," Tell me their theory. "
"24834080","24835620"," That's fine because people trade to it."

"24847600","24848760"," We talked about this early this afternoon."
"24851980","24853320"," Snap that line in your chart. "
"24856340","24858800"," And we trade down to VWAP and the button to the bell."
"24861100","24864280"," But that so then we do all that then we use book map on top of all that."
"24865960","24870880"," Add in a bunch of due diligence, market news, events. "
"24871520","24874480"," We know about sentiment."
"24876100","24877200"," And then options flow."
"24878180","24882000"," Add all those things together in a great community and you should be making money. "

"24936160","24941840"," You'd be surprised fly all these different like flags and dragons and crabs and all these other"
"24941840","24942120"," things. "
"24942120","24943080"," People traded that shit."
"24943800","24946940"," And then you have to look underneath the surface of that stuff."
"24948880","24950380"," With market profile, right?"
"24950580","24951380"," How does that match up?"
"24952100","24956440"," Then you look under the surface of all of that with volatility levels and gamma levels. "
"24957060","24958580"," You start to peel back the layers."
"24959080","24961960"," Sometimes you'll be looking at a bull flag and say that's a bull flag."
"24962100","24965220"," And then underneath you find out that it's not a bull flag. "
"24965360","24966980"," It's actually a bear flag, right?"
"24967480","24969020"," Not a bear flag, but it's bull flag that's faking."
"24969760","24971400"," Like a Soviet traditional chart."
"24972000","24973700"," And you have a failure and you're like, why did it fail?"
"24973920","24976020"," And you don't have these other tools to tell you why you didn't fail. "
"24976360","24977600"," You start to add those other tools."
"24977800","24979660"," You figure it out before you get there."
"24979700","24981420"," So you're like, oh, I'm looking at a bull flag right now. "
"24981920","24985000"," But I know this other information that nobody else knows, right?"
"24985500","24987560"," Why we should fail here and not continue higher."
"24989900","24993180"," Then you want to see a border flow behind at the dome, right?"
"24993360","24995520"," This is the dome or the dome over here on the right hand side."
"24997440","25000300"," There's some things you can't do on the DX. "
"25000500","25004000"," I don't think I can use the border spoofing."
"25004680","25007680"," But it's to start layin' this layer and this stuff in and in and in."
"25016120","25016960"," I layer it all. "
"25017760","25018740"," I start it with a base."
"25019540","25021260"," So when I do..."
"25024690","25027790"," I've got some resources down below in the description of this video."
"25028770","25031050"," I've got resources, but we'll do a resource chat. "
"25031910","25032230"," Some..."
"25032230","25032830"," I think..."
"25034350","25036210"," Yeah, so one thing I want to talk to you about is like..."
"25036210","25037590"," So when I start my day-to-day, right?"
"25037810","25042150"," When I get done here, I'll just do basic charting, right?"
"25042510","25043190"," I don't look at anything."
"25043770","25044670"," It's basic charting."
"25046290","25047650"," Then I open up Market Profile. "
"25049470","25051110"," And I look at the entire market, right?"
"25051610","25053930"," Single prints looking at..."
"25053930","25055250"," We're eating out of iceberg."
"25055610","25057410"," There's like a bunch of sellers here that I don't know about."
"25058090","25061290"," You have blue hair skies above, right?"
"25061770","25062910"," Then I go to spot camera, right?"
"25063050","25063650"," Read their reports. "
"25064990","25069810"," And then I'm looking at my charting and saying, is my charting wrong against these things?"
"25070950","25075410"," And then active day trading, I'm sitting here looking at this stuff here, right?"
"25076110","25078850"," Looking to see, do we have a negative hero indicator?"
"25079590","25081990"," Do we have resistance, actually, we said it was?"
"25082630","25085250"," Is spot gammas numbers correct or not?"
"25085550","25091510"," Has order flow and options come in that has changed the picture of the market, right?"
"25091690","25096570"," Is there like this waterfall cascading of hedging coming in the call or put side that's not"
"25096570","25097290"," accounted for?"
"25098510","25100190"," And these things should give you what you need to know."
"25102970","25107190"," I'm going to check right now to see if there's any premium kick on the put side for the seventh"
"25107190","25108050"," and not seen any."
"25109770","25111130"," So that's a good sign. "
"25111950","25116210"," Up to 136,000 contracts on the call side for Monday on 450C."
"25117390","25122790"," Even though we're selling off right now, we were down like 130, I think, just a few minutes ago."
"25123370","25124610"," So we'll wait to the bell. "
"25125850","25126510"," It's 356."
"25127130","25129990"," We have a rejection, of course, that we're looking at right now in the market."
"25130610","25133970"," We know that VWAP is, we're coming into VWAP right now. "
"25134430","25135210"," This is the original."
"25135570","25136350"," Another LOTTR raising."
"25136530","25137230"," It's quarterly dividend. "
"25138290","25140630"," 6% of us can go to Tango Romeo."
"25142390","25142870"," OTTR."
"25144550","25149930"," Uh, we know that we started down here at this VWAP earlier this afternoon, this morning, 448, 36,"
"25150230","25152910"," we said, or we blew past this from lower from VWAP. "
"25153130","25156150"," But once we blew past this, we said, remember this VWAP number."
"25156650","25158410"," We're trading right back to it into the bell here."
"25159730","25161070"," All things equal, right?"
"25161830","25163370"," Diller's bringing everything all things equal. "
"25164950","25165810"," Into the close on a Friday."
"25171040","25172300"," Diller's flat on a Friday."
"25175040","25184460"," And you guys have to decide what you want to do into the bell. "
"25185160","25187520"," I'll take a look and stick around maybe for the first 15 minutes."
"25187520","25202510"," See if there's any, uh, if there's"
"25202510","25211670"," any sneaky peeps from the bank, or up to 130,000 contracts on 450C, expiring on Monday."
"25212510","25213210"," They're not cheap. "
"25213410","25214170"," They're $2 each."
"25224480","25226900"," We'll watch to see if there's any flow after the bell on a Friday."
"25227400","25231460"," You can go sometimes five Fridays in a row with nothing, and then all of a sudden you'll see, uh,"
"25231620","25234580"," we get hammered with flow on a Friday after the bell. "
"25250820","25252560"," Totally, Euro bloomers, that all you got, bulls."
"25257120","25259540"," I didn't see people piling into the queues right now."
"25260740","25262000"," Maybe you're seeing them somewhere else. "
"25262120","25262660"," I'm not seeing them."
"25265940","25267000"," I love Euro bloomer."
"25267140","25267480"," He's the man. "
"25269140","25270500"," I love bears too."
"25273640","25275840"," I can explain how options work."
"25280960","25283540"," That'll set them to a negative territory heading into the closed. "
"25285900","25287560"," Yeah, it is too late for the murder bowl."
"25287800","25288240"," Oh, I'll go."
"25289560","25290880"," We're likely through 57. "
"25291680","25291960"," Yeah."
"25294800","25296220"," I've got a bunch of plates, so."
"25300320","25302300"," Yeah, the dome is a game changer for sure. "
"25304580","25307560"," Game changer because that's where the truth is."
"25307840","25311720"," After all that shit you do in New York, all your due diligence spies do every day."
"25311800","25314460"," I spend two, you know, spend two, three hours doing this shit every day. "
"25314580","25319720"," Any TV in the Northeast community bank Corp reporting that income of 27 cents a share compared to"
"25319720","25321160"," 22 cents a year ago."
"25325780","25326820"," Yeah, Monday is the day."
"25327440","25328440"," I don't do it. "
"25329920","25330560"," It's over."
"25334140","25338180"," It went from 80,360 to 104,000 at 360."
"25338940","25339980"," No shit, David. "
"25350660","25352060"," I have to check my puts right now."
"25364320","25365220"," I've got this one."
"25365460","25366220"," Like I had a set of prints. "
"25366520","25370820"," I had a set of puts that were real deep and they started to print."
"25371640","25372520"," I took the money on those."
"25373120","25378160"," I've got these four, 40, 442s, but they're they're going to gain more money over time. "
"25379820","25383500"," I'm staying I'm hanging on to those and then I've got some naked that naked puts."
"25383520","25390740"," Those are selling calls, but I've got I've got just some holding some some puts spying on the"
"25390740","25391460"," seven."
"25394280","25396300"," Then I they're not gaining anything right now. "
"25398080","25399900"," There's no premium creep on them."
"25400800","25408060"," That was 140,000 calls on 185 or excuse me now 140,000 calls on 450 C."
"25408480","25410220"," Those have come down to a dollar 85."
"25410600","25413740"," They're getting cheaper as we get closer to the bell or after the bell 401. "
"25414280","25417180"," So we'll see if these leak off a little bit."
"25417240","25422060"," If we can get these down like a dollar or something, dollar 25, and the next 14, 15 minutes might"
"25422060","25423460"," be interested in buying some of these."
"25423940","25425380"," They're a dollar 80 right now. "
"25426380","25433860"," They were up at like 250, maybe yeah, 268, I think at one point in higher earlier when we're"
"25433860","25435560"," streaming to the top, they're much higher."
"25438000","25439860"," I think they're at four bucks at one point."
"25441420","25446720"," Four dollars, I think the 450 C's from Monday where I like four dollars, close to four dollars like"
"25446720","25448360"," 380, something like that. "
"25449100","25451840"," Now I got about dollar 80 getting cheaper."
"25453360","25454740"," Full is committing to Monday."
"25459030","25460970"," Is there a bloody Sunday, bloody Sunday?"
"25464340","25465520"," Good job Evan flow. "
"25465520","25474310"," All the way down went from 80,000 or 4,000 contracts."
"25474850","25475730"," It's negative."
"25478610","25480570"," You guys all have a wonderful weekend by the way. "
"25481790","25483930"," They want to stay flat on calls."
"25484990","25485790"," It's really 402."
"25486110","25492150"," If I see something change here, I don't see a bunch of put flow into Monday. "
"25495050","25502950"," You guys see a bunch of CIFCO reporting first quarter net sales down 23% to 19.2 million."
"25504550","25506910"," I think the trade might be in small caps too."
"25508030","25508730"," The bear trade. "
"25510550","25518800"," I think there might be a bear trade in the in small caps over time."
"25519900","25522700"," We'll stick around here for the next 13 minutes."
"25523260","25532960"," Currently, I am flat on the bull side and I'm bag holding some puts on that"
"25532960","25537660"," expire on Monday and then I've got some put spreads expire on February 18th. "
"25537980","25540760"," Still holding run, still holding Peton."
"25540920","25541980"," Peton, I don't care if it burns."
"25543780","25549340"," Run was more of a test on trading the news, seeing if they would print. "
"25549840","25550680"," They seem like they're going to print."
"25553020","25558720"," We'll stick around and run because they got a price target in mind on that one where the true"
"25558720","25562200"," resistance is on run from book map."
"25565770","25569330"," They had a good ER and they teamed up with Ford. "
"25570550","25573290"," I think that should print."
"25574010","25577250"," That's got good fundamentals behind printing, like real fundamentals."
"25579130","25587600"," The 450 C's are now down to $1.45 again, they're getting sexy right here. "
"25588540","25589220"," I'm not going to lie."
"25590140","25592740"," Like 450 C's 404, right?"
"25593440","25600360"," 450 C's are down for a minute at $1.45, which is getting cheap."
"25601340","25608560"," I figure if you get a bunch of bulls that are upside down at four bucks, they're now down to"
"25608560","25611620"," $1.45, starting to get dirt cheap. "
"25612520","25613780"," So we'll stick around until 415."
"25614180","25620320"," I like cheap puts and I like cheap calls."
"25624580","25626460"," So you get these calls down to $1. "
"25627500","25630400"," Even $1.45 is kind of starting to get sexy."
"25631400","25638150"," Like dollar calls hold over the weekend in the money too."
"25641740","25642540"," Yeah, what's Bitcoin?"
"25642760","25643700"," I've never heard of Bitcoin either. "
"25643860","25644120"," What's that?"
"25644260","25644980"," Is that a ticker?"
"25652460","25654040"," ER today, the names."
"25655020","25660000"," It was, I think it was still a lot of energy and it wasn't anything that I was tracking."
"25662840","25664540"," For this week, I'm done with earnings. "
"25664780","25670020"," I'm going to over the weekend, I'm spending time on some earnings stuff, focusing my weekend on"
"25670020","25673580"," looking at small and mid caps for the next two to three weeks."
"25673580","25675140"," Oh, we had Ali today."
"25676580","25677720"," We had energy, we had Phillips. "
"25678040","25681160"," Yeah, Chevron, Huntington Bank, for some reason."
"25681840","25684260"," Armand Hammer, Chevron, Phillips 66."
"25686980","25687900"," CBOE was today. "
"25690140","25692040"," Paulo, Dominion Energy."
"25693320","25694600"," John Deere was today as well."
"25695140","25696680"," Oh no, so I get the wrong scratch. "
"25696800","25697860"," Everything I just said to you."
"25698060","25698880"," I'm looking at the monthly calendar."
"25699740","25700720"," Like that's all wrong. "
"25702760","25703640"," Hold on a second."
"25705780","25707360"," I think that's all fucking wrong."
"25712960","25715200"," Some reason I don't have the ones for today in front of me. "
"25719430","25722270"," Yeah, so let's say we've got Bristol Myers Squibb, Regeneron."
"25723330","25724470"," That's XPI shit, right?"
"25726170","25734290"," Santa Fe, CBOE, Aeon, Royal Caribbean, Brookfield Air Products, Twist."
"25734970","25736810"," How's RCL doing in the after hours?"
"25740730","25742490"," We had lots of money come in. "
"25743550","25744370"," Oh, no, wait."
"25744490","25746710"," This morning was there, was there a report this morning?"
"25748210","25750070"," Is that why we're getting a bunch of stuff on RCL?"
"25750070","25752870"," A lot of people out of debt buyers today in RCL, maybe."
"25765050","25766990"," Yeah, Q2 should be Rough Comps. "
"25767570","25775970"," You know, David, the thing about Q2 is you know, who is the City of Banamax Survey of the Columbus,"
"25777170","25780110"," putting a 2022 seat down at 4.4 percent."
"25780350","25784850"," That's a one-tenth from the prior forecast for Mexico."
"25786170","25789450"," Mexico's CPI is higher than expected for the forecast of the year. "
"25789510","25794530"," I think this year's GDP, three-tenths to 2.2 percent in City of Banamax Survey."
"25796630","25798130"," The problem is, right?"
"25798430","25804270"," They didn't do it or it looks like some companies are doing it right now, but I talked about this"
"25804270","25810010"," on Twitter, and then we've always talked about it yesterday on Twitter, was that for Q2, you're"
"25810010","25813690"," eventually going to see companies right there, their dirty laundry."
"25814050","25818490"," We thought they would get the airing of dirty laundry this ER season, and we haven't. "
"25818890","25827090"," We got some guidance, so we've been getting looks like they'll have a dirty laundry airing session"
"25827090","25827870"," in Q2."
"25831570","25833850"," So I'm looking forward to that as well."
"25840830","25841890"," Yeah, free money is gone. "
"25842730","25843910"," Five acts are back, I agree."
"25844890","25847210"," The key, though, is you know they're going to hear dirty laundry."
"25847470","25848270"," We know this, right?"
"25848530","25854430"," We all know that they're going to pick a quarter this year, and they're going to just roll up the"
"25854430","25857430"," dog shit, and they didn't do it. "
"25857670","25859350"," That's some of the smaller companies have been doing it."
"25859810","25860870"," The big ones haven't."
"25864050","25868170"," So, do we get that airing of dirty laundry in the small mid-caps this quarter?"
"25870690","25873830"," I think that's what some of that betting against small caps was yesterday. "
"25874930","25879170"," Was that people are going to, or small small big caps are going to air their dirty laundry now, and"
"25879170","25881650"," you get the big caps that'll air their dirty laundry Q2."
"25882810","25883510"," Take the hit."
"25884910","25885670"," No more dividends. "
"25887030","25888050"," Sorry, dividend bros."
"25888250","25889310"," You're going to miss out for a quarter."
"25894310","25897410"," We got to spy selling off into the after hours as well. "
"25898450","25899930"," Down 63 cents."
"25904120","25908780"," Not seeing anything come in right now on the after hours flow."
"25909220","25915240"," Sometimes I see after hours flow right at 4.12, 4.15. Just legions. "
"25915580","25916420"," They'll just sneak in."
"25916540","25917660"," Some calls are put heavy."
"25918500","25919680"," We'll stick around for five more minutes. "
"25922920","25924160"," I think the rate's full too."
"25935090","25936630"," Thanks, Spark, if you're saying they'd be."
"25936830","25937750"," Yes, just hit the view up. "
"25942170","25944010"," I don't know, Evan flow."
"25946070","25947370"," My thought right now is on the."
"25950650","25952030"," Junk bongets are tanking. "
"25953590","25954490"," There's a lot of."
"25958570","25959830"," It's hard, you know."
"25961730","25964750"," So I have a market view of being very bearish right now. "
"25969270","25975200"," But it's hard because you have to trade the markets in front of you at all times, even though I'm"
"25975200","25976680"," going to bearish stance, right?"
"25982270","25984450"," So it's really kind of crazy."
"25986290","25988390"," Having to take a bearish stance in the market."
"25993300","25996340"," And then also while knowing this market only goes up. "
"26002960","26008040"," Let's be honest, for the first since January one, or not January one, but January fourth or"
"26008040","26008680"," whatever it was."
"26009520","26010360"," It was January fourth, right?"
"26013520","26014380"," Nothing's been bullish."
"26016280","26017340"," None of it. "
"26022070","26022450"," Nothing."
"26024590","26027530"," Oh, you got the four fifty twos for money for seventy seven cents."
"26027530","26028470"," Good job, do boy. "
"26030570","26034590"," There's nothing on the grand scheme of things that's bullish about this market."
"26038700","26039800"," Yeah, the real market has."
"26040160","26042340"," You know, David, I got to tell you one other thing, right?"
"26043220","26046660"," So I'm a long, I was started out as a bear, lost my money that I became a bull. "
"26047580","26050380"," So I trade as a bull mostly like 70% of the time."
"26050380","26052480"," I'm bullish and then 30% of the time bearish."
"26052480","26053700"," That's generally speaking, right?"
"26056100","26058860"," But I was with Joe Harper and I are talking. "
"26061680","26064020"," And when you've been in the market long enough, right?"
"26064760","26066180"," There is a point where you say."
"26067780","26068980"," There's a point where you say."
"26071080","26072940"," You know, I'm not willing to buy this anymore. "
"26074060","26075420"," And I want cheaper prices."
"26076040","26077860"," It's not just bears saying the real market."
"26078020","26079160"," There are bulls that want. "
"26079160","26081000"," It's still probably a real awful problem."
"26081800","26084480"," You know, there are bears that are, we see bulls."
"26084800","26086720"," There are bulls that want a better price. "
"26087520","26090160"," And then there's just living through seeing shit like this in the past."
"26090520","26092260"," Even when it plays out, it takes two, three years."
"26095680","26098000"," It looks like it's starting to look like a duck. "
"26099000","26099620"," We could try."
"26099820","26106340"," We could still trade to 460, not for a five, six or five, fifty or six hundred and still be"
"26106340","26107480"," very bearish right now."
"26115140","26120160"," Well, you know, the best part of the job report today was what was portrayed as going to be"
"26120160","26122400"," released and what was released for two different things. "
"26122440","26124180"," And the market reaction was kind of the same."
"26125760","26127380"," That shit matters and it doesn't matter."
"26128540","26129740"," You guys have a wonderful weekend. "
"26132280","26136380"," Any guys that are bouncing out of here have a wonderful weekend just having a whiskey with"
"26136380","26137160"," whoever's left over."
"26137520","26138660"," Cheers to all of you that are out there."
"26138740","26140160"," We're having a whiskey with anything in the day. "
"26141340","26148080"," Yeah, I mean, but you know, it's fucked up too, David, is that terrible with the market trades and"
"26148080","26149440"," what we did and what we will do."
"26149580","26155820"," Yeah, the QT is going to, so like on a macro scale, we could talk macro all day long."
"26156100","26158360"," That's what people don't want to understand is the fucking money is gone. "
"26159280","26160020"," That's the truth."
"26161300","26164300"," I don't know that we're at the end of a long-term debt cycle."
"26165300","26170320"," The moment that the Fed put comes in, we're back into not being at the end of a long-term"
"26170320","26170860"," debt cycle. "
"26171420","26178620"," If the Fed starts printing money again at any fucking point, they are right now, technically, but"
"26181970","26185290"," damn, Amazon got dumped into right on David."
"26186090","26186750"," Cheers, brother."
"26188970","26190810"," You haven't touched out as a Scotch. "
"26193770","26196630"," That's weird because here, Cheers to you too."
"26199270","26207130"," That's weird, is that a try to talk to new traders and investors about this stuff and it's hard for"
"26207870","26210950"," unless you've been trading for a long time, it's hard to wrap your head around the different"
"26210950","26215890"," moments in the market and how you're switching back and forth and how the market's moving back and"
"26215890","26219970"," forth and people are like, yeah, you're saying you're this, but you're that and you're this, you're"
"26219970","26224450"," that and it's like, well, I still have all these other layers to my bullish and bearishness and I"
"26224450","26225530"," still have to make money."
"26226710","26230270"," People are like, why don't you just take a stand and say, I'm a fucking bear and that's what I'm"
"26230270","26232470"," going to be because I've lost money doing that shit. "
"26233350","26237970"," Right, I've lost that money being a bull too, just being like, just a bull period."
"26238570","26239830"," So you have to move back and forth."
"26244810","26245170"," Robert. "
"26248930","26250830"," Right on ice cold, Dr. Pepper, just some guy."
"26251110","26251510"," I got you."
"26255050","26256210"," Hell yeah, I'll see you on Twitter. "
"26256690","26257450"," I'll be drinking tonight."
"26257470","26259190"," I would drink heavily in a while, Quinn."
"26259430","26264170"," So you probably see me on there at some point tonight, fucking around with people pissing them off. "
"26265550","26267890"," Have a great weekend blind, uh, nestle."
"26268270","26273410"," Yeah, David, like that's, um, you know, Robert, like all you guys out there that are bears."
"26274050","26276030"," I think some of you guys are bulls too. "
"26276590","26280050"," Yeah, I don't think you're all like super, super bearish."
"26280050","26286090"," I think you're smarter than a lot of a lot of people because you guys see the entire market border"
"26286090","26286630"," really is."
"26286750","26287910"," And dude, the truth is, right?"
"26288630","26291950"," This morning, I did that video this morning, or the start of this video this morning. "
"26291950","26297890"," And I'm looking at charts going like I'm just looking at this chart and I'm like, oh, it's forming"
"26297890","26298870"," up just like January."
"26300410","26304910"," You know, and if we see a drop to 450 and then it's the other thing, the last drop we"
"26304910","26305450"," had down to 420."
"26306430","26313370"," I was like paying attention to CNBC and I'm paying attention to bulls. "
"26315230","26319130"," And they were fucking ready to buy the dip and CNBC was like by the dip."
"26319870","26325470"," And then you got ultra balls being like I'm buying the dip and I'm like, man, this doesn't look"
"26325470","26329330"," like a bottom to me on a on a real correction."
"26329830","26332110"," I mean, I know real corrections aren't like this. "
"26332550","26334130"," Like real corrections that I've been in."
"26334890","26336290"," Fucking nobody buys them."
"26337170","26338610"," Only the banks buy them. "
"26340470","26345870"," You'll see like a huge V shape, shape, recovery, and then people get in there that scared."
"26347290","26348130"," I have a great weekend."
"26348310","26348810"," I owns. "
"26351330","26352170"," I couldn't see it."
"26352250","26352630"," The dog park."
"26353130","26354770"," I could buy it. "
"26354830","26355830"," All my sons out there too."
"26357510","26358570"," I have a great weekend."
"26358730","26359390"," I have a blind SL. "
"26360630","26360950"," Wow."
"26361230","26361730"," Have a great weekend."
"26362570","26363070"," They're still there. "
"26363230","26365010"," So I want to just get a market value record for Amazon."
"26365790","26366330"," $90 billion."
"26366730","26366970"," Yeah. "
"26367070","26367710"," I think they're buying."
"26369650","26369970"," Yeah."
"26370090","26370490"," Thanks Avery. "
"26370910","26372410"," So you got to do that too."
"26372510","26374210"," This says so many facets to this, right?"
"26374210","26376890"," So you make a statement."
"26376890","26377970"," This is a fair point, right?"
"26379010","26382030"," They bought the bottom of Amazon, right?"
"26382210","26383170"," It's because they have to. "
"26383850","26385550"," It's not like they just stop buying."
"26385990","26388210"," They stop buying until the fucking music stops."
"26389510","26390330"," That's what they do. "
"26394990","26395910"," They still buy."
"26396690","26397790"," They'll fucking buy everything."
"26398110","26401970"," They'll buy it to the last moment when the guy at the top says sell it all. "
"26402330","26403690"," Like that's how fucked up it is."
"26404790","26409510"," You know, the banks do some of the best traders in the world."
"26409890","26411670"," They trade it until it's done and gone. "
"26412210","26416250"," Even if they're bearish, even if they think we're going to sell this market, they're still going to"
"26416250","26418690"," buy the dip on Amazon."
"26419610","26420910"," In case we do go up."
"26423760","26425380"," Hey, GP, take it easy, brother. "
"26426340","26428260"," Brother Barr, Jasmine, have a wonderful weekend."
"26431290","26433410"," All this dude, this is the year of all."
"26433410","26438550"," You're rethinking the election ads, ban ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. "
"26441800","26443100"," Yeah, they are selling their book."
"26449080","26450680"," Easy set up to pick up on."
"26452140","26454460"," It's easy, but yeah, like, I don't know. "
"26454640","26460860"," I don't know what to say."
"26461280","26464780"," There's so many facets to being an investor trader."
"26465240","26469520"," All this shit just takes years of, like it just gets so ingrained in you that at some point you're"
"26469520","26471740"," like, you're like, fuck it. "
"26471920","26473600"," You're, of course, going to buy the fucking dip."
"26474100","26476020"," The fucking buy the dip on the way down."
"26476380","26477280"," And the market was crashing. "
"26478380","26480140"," You know, 708 they were buying the fucking dip."
"26480280","26480960"," They're trying to make a market."
"26481440","26485040"," I mean, 87, they didn't have a market in that crash, and they had to create a market. "
"26485620","26486980"," So they're going to buy the fucking dip."
"26487680","26488440"," That's what they're going to do."
"26489820","26490200"," Good day. "
"26490320","26490840"," Have a great weekend."
"26492740","26493980"," Oh, right on with Tias."
"26494860","26496400"," Miro, good to see you, brother. "
"26497300","26498120"," Thanks to him, brother."
"26498540","26499840"," Thanks for your insights, always, Miro."
"26499840","26501540"," Thanks for adding to the community, man. "
"26501740","26502960"," I really want to say it to you."
"26504680","26505560"," Cooked D, take it easy."
"26508870","26510190"," Yeah, buy him, did pick up. "
"26510270","26512410"," And we've got a great dip off that Euro close too."
"26517630","26518630"," Right on Taka Monkey."
"26522590","26523790"," I trade small caps. "
"26524010","26525910"," I'll swing over to the trade small caps."
"26526330","26528990"," I'll raise the dividend two and a half percent, Romeo and November, Romeo."
"26529710","26536430"," If Spy ends up getting boring the next few weeks, Spy could die a slow death. "
"26538390","26543290"," If Spy dies a slow death while where everybody's focused on small mid caps, there'll be some money"
"26543290","26543670"," we made."
"26547650","26549250"," I love the Euro close and opens."
"26549670","26551390"," I watched the Euro open a mill a more than two. "
"26557560","26558520"," You guys have a wonderful weekend."
"26559000","26560260"," All right, I'm going to check out guys."
"26561140","26562240"," Why you guys have a wonderful weekend?"

"26574880","26575280"," Discord."
"26575560","26581820"," We're trying to put something together so we can get all of your input for what you guys thinking"
"26581820","26582620"," for the week coming up."
"26584340","26590500"," I'm looking at small mid caps and whatever's left over the big caps for the next few weeks. "
