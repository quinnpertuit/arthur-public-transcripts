"305040","305160"," left."
"305400","306580"," I let a try G."
"306840","308340"," Just left a huge gap. "
"310060","311960"," On the opening bell this morning."
"317840","319520"," Dixie looking bullish as well."
"319520","321160"," It's got a bull cross coming on it. "
"321680","325620"," Nasdaq had a gap that had left on the opening bell this morning on the 15 minute."
"326900","328460"," I've got it."
"328740","334020"," Nasdaq on the 15 minutes specifically here. "
"334380","339500"," You saw remember yesterday that it did not recover off of that."
"340100","342880"," That was where the trap was on spa yesterday."
"343980","346440"," Can you remember that when we were sitting up in here?"
"347560","350900"," We had said there was a potential bull trap up in here. "
"351460","354060"," And they teed right off on this on the clothes yesterday."
"354060","355340"," Came right down here."
"356180","358060"," We had some nice selling in the overnight. "
"358880","363180"," But of course, you saw some of that recovery into this opening bell this morning."
"364560","365700"," I was kind of fascinated."
"366320","368840"," I was I was slightly fascinated yesterday. "
"369160","370600"," I read some of the articles that came out."
"371340","373060"," Can you guys hear me?"
"373620","374300"," All right."
"374380","374440"," Good. "
"374540","374600"," Good."
"375180","381040"," So it was kind of fascinated reading the recap of Jerome yesterday."
"381220","387600"," When he was speaking yesterday and we saw him say I never said pause. "
"388660","395000"," I was kind of dumbfounded and was dumbfounded as to the to the wasn't dumbfounded."
"395000","401160"," But what he said I was dumbfounded by how I was reported in the news yesterday because I'm like,"
"401160","402560"," wait a minute, we got a pause."
"404040","405560"," I'm like, we got a fucking pause. "
"407180","408740"," There's no rate increase, right?"
"410240","414420"," And he also said that we were getting two rate hikes in the future."
"414860","420180"," This is at the last rate hike meeting rate or rate decision."
"420960","429540"," So I was kind of scratching my head there as to how the person or what the perception was or"
"429540","435620"," that perception but how I was reported yesterday, I was kind of just scratching my head. "
"435960","445800"," And we knew also previously that he needed to come out with he needed"
"445800","453650"," to come out with when"
"453650","462030"," he was pausing on the right decision that when he had his presser that he had to come out swinging"
"462030","462470"," right?"
"462950","464110"," This is not a pause."
"464150","466730"," You're getting more rate increases in the future."
"467510","475630"," And we also know that as long as we get rate increases in the future, it's it's bullish for the"
"475630","476330"," stock market. "
"477090","485370"," You don't usually at this point in the process see the last capitulation phase of the market."
"486250","493550"," You have some of you guys know this and you guys don't you have the distribution down, right?"
"493770","494630"," And there's a bottom."
"494990","495590"," There's a trough. "
"496610","501350"," We go back down one more time and test it before it goes like this actually."
"502050","503770"," We cross above right there."
"504590","505670"," You have like a bottom. "
"505810","508390"," You have a trough zone and then you have one more tag below."
"509050","510390"," And this last tag below."
"510770","512549"," This is actually usually a failure up here. "
"514110","517530"," And what happens is you get break cuts like right here."
"518750","524070"," And when you get your rate cuts right there, you get one more retest to the downside."
"524590","525350"," It's like a fake out. "
"526870","529530"," And then you're breaking out of the trough."
"529810","530910"," This is the trough down here."
"532790","534310"," And then you get a recovery. "
"535150","535430"," So."
"537430","541810"," Like the one some bulls out there a week or two ago when we were in the rate."
"542750","544910"," The rate hike decision meeting. "
"546090","551630"," I saw a lot of bull saying leading into that saying we want to we want to pause and then"
"551630","552550"," no more rate hikes."
"553350","555710"," Then we'll recut the market will recover from that."
"555710","557770"," And I'm in disagreement with that. "
"557890","562270"," I feel as though if they ever pause with a pause or cut."
"563710","569370"," Without strong language or relaying strong language that rate hikes are not done."
"570110","572270"," We would have to see a significant decline. "
"573410","574410"," In the market."
"574630","577230"," So even yesterday with what he was saying."
"578450","580710"," How it's spun of course in the news. "
"582090","585730"," You know it's it's it's just fun for story right story time."
"587690","592150"," But if anything that still is good for a bull."
"593550","596830"," Bulls for any kind of continuation in the market. "
"597490","600330"," Need to see the continuation of rate hikes."
"600910","603290"," It means that what they're doing is working."
"603910","606890"," That he's taking inflation seriously. "
"607870","611370"," And that we're at and that we're not at the point where we've broken something."
"612110","615730"," When a when a Fed chair says expect more rate hikes."
"617570","624670"," It means that the the our economic cycle is a whole steam ahead. "
"625950","627730"," No matter what you want to think."
"628410","632750"," I don't care what you think I care what the Fed president thinks."
"633530","638230"," And if he continues to think that he needs to continue to raise rates. "
"638230","639690"," It means he has not broken anything."
"641630","646270"," It means that our our economic activity is is on fire right now right."
"646470","647230"," We got too many jobs. "
"648190","649150"," Being offered."
"649890","656470"," We have too many people employed fascinating to us just looking at the Detroit."
"657570","662230"," Employment in unemployment numbers and this includes all of Detroit. "
"662230","663310"," Metroid Detroit."
"664070","665690"," And they're in a Goldilocks zone."
"666070","671650"," They're in this position where unemployment is rising, but it's not uncontrollable. "
"672350","677250"," And but the offers of employment are also rising."
"677970","684090"," So there's a lot of jobs available right and there's a lot of people taking on jobs."
"684750","686170"," At the same time. "
"686390","691750"," So it's like three things is like this like trifecta of things that are going on in Detroit."
"692090","698670"," You've got unemployment rate is rising, but it was rising from a very small level, right?"
"698850","700150"," So it's it's still acceptable."
"700970","706310"," You've got a jobs report basically for Detroit that's booming. "
"707250","710670"," Then you also have demand for workers that are unavailable."
"711270","714550"," So it's like this small it's like this perfect pocket of a Goldilocks zone."
"714630","716750"," And of course Jerome does not want that right. "
"717270","720890"," Jerome wants he is not going to tell you this, but he wants some job destruction."
"723170","724510"," In this tightening phase."
"726310","730210"," I'm going to pull up the video for you guys to send it here and when it starts. "
"745910","749350"," We're still kind of in that sweet spot right now with."
"752310","766660"," Yeah, there's"
"766660","767340"," still not a."
"776190","777310"," Just a second here."
"785570","786390"," There we go. "
"789980","794680"," There's still we're still not at that point where we've broken stuff."
"794680","796360"," That's that's the plain plain fact."
"796720","800160"," And as long as he continues to promise that and he promises it aggressively. "
"801300","802580"," It's a bull's best friend."
"802700","803740"," I want you to know out there."
"804160","811080"," I don't know how many economic cycles you've been through, but I've been through a bunch and you're"
"811080","811980"," looking for that. "
"812080","817080"," You're looking for that moments where they're pausing seriously like we're done."
"817520","819180"," They're either above the rate of inflation."
"820060","822840"," They're close to meeting the rate of inflation. "
"823760","827460"," They're close to this point where they or they've broken something you're seeing."
"828460","831720"," Large corporations, banks, stuff like that to begin to fail."
"832280","834900"," I always tell you guys that it's easy for you to find out. "
"836380","838360"," It's easy for you guys to find out."
"840120","841420"," When that's happening."
"842500","845320"," You could you it's easy for you to see this is a one minute chart right now. "
"845340","846440"," It's easy for you to see it."
"848620","852160"," In your own communities as it's happening."
"852660","857480"," So most of my adult life I've spent in very wealthy places. "
"858020","864840"," And you could tell I always talk to a buddy of mine and I tell them an easy way to"
"864840","867700"," find out is if if you're service."
"868900","871820"," Tip service employees that work."
"872160","878300"," I would not work for you, but like like if you go to like a hotel and the door people"
"878300","882060"," are really good at their job or your semi is very good at their job. "
"883180","888520"," If you're a server, your waiter, your waitress, whatever that person is, if they're really good at"
"888520","890760"," their job and you're like, wow, well, the service is getting excellent."
"891340","897120"," Those are some sure signs that you can ask those people say, you know, do you do this normally and"
"897120","897680"," they'll say, Oh, no."
"897680","900480"," I'm a real terror or something, right?"
"901240","902740"," And there's no work for me right now. "
"903440","907820"," And you'll also notice that you're able to do things that you wouldn't normally be able to do."
"908820","912300"," All of those trips to fancy places that you could no longer afford."
"913300","919620"," All of a sudden you'll notice that those will be offered to you because these places like places"
"919620","922960"," like they'll you can't go there if you're middle class. "
"922960","923920"," I'll be honest with you."
"923980","925080"," You can't afford that vacation."
"925520","926320"," Most people can't. "
"926640","932240"," Those vacations are 10, 20, 30, $40,000 for most people once in a lifetime trip for a lot of"
"932240","932760"," people to do."
"934020","939300"," So if you're you start to see these things, you'll see your neighborhood will become empty."
"939860","942260"," You see lots of for sale signs. "
"942560","944160"," You'll see on occupied properties."
"944420","947460"," You'll see people stop taking care of their lawns, that kind of stuff."
"947640","949320"," Your friends will begin to get divorces. "
"949320","954020"," Those are very easy ways to see if the Fed has broken something."
"956360","962080"," You'll see companies that long time companies that will go bankrupt unexpectedly."
"963100","966600"," So we're at the end of one of those cycles and of a tightening cycle. "
"966760","968540"," Typically you'll see those things in advance."
"969320","970840"," Right now we're not really seeing that, right?"
"970980","971820"," It's not apparent."
"972480","977680"," You hear people out there say things like, I can't afford this or I can't afford that. "
"978520","980960"," Or I'm working two jobs or."
"981640","983540"," I don't know."
"983960","986440"," Have you noticed how expensive eggs are, that kind of stuff?"
"987320","990820"," But they're not actually broken yet. "
"991520","997440"," So you want to pay attention to that stuff as he continues to tight his tightening cycle."
"997440","1004560"," At 9.55 a.m. Eastern time we expect comments from feds Bowman who delivers opening remarks at a Fed"
"1004560","1007680"," Listens event hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland."
"1008160","1010240"," Text is expected but no Q&A. "
"1012000","1019560"," It's not saying anything here in my news feed about Jerome testifying today at 10."
"1020440","1025160"," But I do have something on the Senate hearing from the actual Senate office."
"1025540","1027839"," So find out what that means. "
"1027839","1035140"," Another note today too is like clockwork on Thursdays and Fridays every week."
"1035140","1036300"," We got a green day."
"1038160","1041140"," Then you get zero to eight Fridays for tech. "
"1044599","1048140"," Now in a short week this week, we don't know if we're going to get that today."
"1049340","1055500"," We do have I think believe PC tomorrow and Friday and then we still have Jerome speaking today."
"1055500","1060680"," I think he's got some of the people that like to grandstand grilling him today. "
"1060800","1061980"," If I'm wrong on that, let me know somewhere."
"1062640","1068400"," I'm still on the page that we've got your room today and we're going to get like probably a bunch"
"1068400","1070100"," of senators that want to grandstand."
"1073140","1074920"," So anyways, okay, so that's all out of the way. "
"1075280","1077380"," Next thing, I have a bunch of stuff."
"1077540","1083160"," If you're listening out there right now, if you're watching right now and if you have my phone"
"1083160","1087260"," number you no longer have my phone number."
"1087400","1088080"," I want you to know that. "
"1088300","1093840"," So if you're out there and you've tried to contact me via phone since yesterday, I have since"
"1093840","1096960"," changed my phone number through the day."
"1097820","1102360"," Throughout the throughout the day when I'm broadcasting at this point, I'm getting somewhere in the"
"1102360","1103400"," neighborhood of."
"1106160","1109640"," You're probably not going to believe this, but somewhere in the neighborhood of. "
"1110300","1115380"," 200 text messages while I'm live streaming."
"1116360","1122760"," So as you make this transition to releasing the tool and all that kind of stuff, I've had to turn"
"1122760","1131160"," off that phone number and just a point that I have tenants and business associates outside of this"
"1131160","1131440"," stuff."
"1132520","1135660"," Family members, that kind of stuff that also try to contact me. "
"1137080","1142320"," And just at this point, I had to turn that phone number off, contact all those people, let them"
"1142320","1142560"," know."
"1143540","1149300"," If you, some of you I will be reaching out to to give me, give my phone number too, so"
"1149300","1153140"," that you can contact me and I'll give you, I'll let you know what's going on with that."
"1153380","1155040"," So you used to have my phone number. "
"1155780","1158580"," I want you to know that it's dead now at this point."
"1159380","1163480"," And I probably have to call some of you and signal or something like that from this point forward"
"1163480","1164780"," in the future."
"1165860","1172420"," Some of you though, if you're a partner or someone that works with me, something like that, you'll"
"1172420","1174520"," get my phone number on the background. "
"1174980","1177820"," So I had to do that well yesterday and later in the afternoon."
"1178780","1183380"," I'm being overrun right now with too much access or something like that."
"1184540","1188320"," And that I can't it's like it's just like an avalanche at this point. "
"1188860","1189880"," It's not your fault either."
"1190040","1190800"," It's mostly my fault."
"1191380","1193560"," I didn't expect to be where we are right now. "
"1194680","1200420"," And so as we continue to grow, I guess, has to make some changes."
"1202380","1203320"," It's not a bad thing."
"1204000","1205540"," Just a lot of work to do. "
"1205800","1209540"," I didn't expect it to be where we are right now in any way, shape or form."
"1210280","1210400"," So."
"1213380","1215040"," Yeah, my phone. "
"1215280","1217440"," It's not in the outside of live stream."
"1217600","1218900"," It's 24 hours a day."
"1218900","1228900"," So I get it because I understand because for I know that a lot of you, your only"
"1228900","1232240"," interaction with me is on a live stream or whatever. "
"1232780","1235120"," But it's a job."
"1235340","1236800"," It's like 10, 12 hours a day minimum."
"1237320","1242420"," And so it's just it's it's I'm losing my productivity at the same time. "
"1242800","1244960"," Let's try to get what I need to get done and that kind of stuff."
"1246460","1248080"," So just just the heads up."
"1248540","1253840"," And some of you, you'll get other ways to contact me to stay in touch with me. "
"1253900","1256040"," That kind of stuff that I can keep in touch with you as well."
"1256480","1258200"," Of course, like DMs are still open."
"1258200","1260360"," Although my DMs are overrun at this point. "
"1260520","1265740"," My emails are overrun kind of being overrun here in general."
"1265860","1272440"," And I need to try to funnel some of this stuff so that I can actually respond to people."
"1273280","1274820"," And actually get contacted. "
"1275040","1276900"," It's like being overrun across the board."
"1277280","1282120"," It's like DMs, DSCOR, Twitter, Gmail."
"1283000","1285880"," And I have people actually looking at some of this stuff every day. "
"1286720","1289700"," And even that's taking me a half an hour just to get through with somebody."
"1290640","1291500"," Doing it with me."
"1291680","1293860"," So it's not you. "
"1293960","1294900"," It's just mostly me."
"1295480","1296260"," So I apologize."
"1296900","1299200"," And we're going to try to make some changes to make sure that. "
"1299200","1302640"," I can point in fact, too."
"1303940","1310800"," Winky is a large part of who produces the show."
"1311580","1314400"," And I really need him to get through to me during the day. "
"1314600","1319700"," Like I need him in my air all day long from the start to the finish of the show."
"1320440","1323100"," Because I've got, you know, I'm trying to produce all this stuff here."
"1323480","1324720"," I could also get it to you then. "
"1326300","1327200"," Trade as well."
"1327580","1331920"," And then try to interact with Discord and then trying to trade all the same time."
"1332420","1335460"," And it's just, it's really difficult. "
"1336580","1337580"," So it's not you guys."

"1348600","1351620"," That's just a programming note for everybody out there following along right now. "
"1351620","1365460"," Yeah, you"
"1365460","1368620"," know, it's like, um, I think I have to go to like a sick and that's another thing."
"1368620","1371780"," I have to go to a signal thing and then, um."
"1373700","1376860"," Because I'm sure that things will get weird and nefarious. "
"1377260","1378520"," And that's not you people."
"1378520","1382040"," But we'll attract that kind of stuff as time moves forward."
"1387410","1392590"," So Feds Bowman and Feds Mester are speaking at the same event and we have posted the live video on"
"1392590","1393890"," the feed for all those interested. "
"1394830","1395690"," It's kind of weird."
"1395890","1401610"," They're like pushing a master speaking at an event right now and their posts are there."
"1406500","1409040"," Yeah, I'm going to put Jerome Powell on. "
"1409080","1411020"," I'm not going to put master on."
"1411020","1413360"," I don't care what he's saying."
"1420520","1421240"," Give it. "
"1421400","1423080"," Yeah, I got like nothing for him."

"1443790","1445910"," Like, Paul's kind of the guy you want to be watching here."

"1450490","1451630"," So I've got him up in the background. "

"1468180","1469220"," So we'll take a look at Uber this morning."
"1469880","1472820"," I don't want you to think out there that I don't like speaking to you either."
"1473360","1476920"," I loved having conversations with if you have conversations with me. "
"1477520","1478540"," I love you."

"1520840","1526700"," He's like, people don't ever get access, uh, to streamers and stuff like that."
"1526780","1527480"," I want you guys all tonight. "

"1539860","1542580"," So, uh, I like that."
"1542720","1544620"," I don't want you to think that I'm someone that's unreachable."
"1544800","1547000"," I don't want you to think in the future that I'm not reachable either. "
"1547620","1553540"," It just has to be something where, um, more constructive, like, uh, you reach out to me."
"1553600","1556660"," Let's say in, um, in Twitter, Twitch chat, let's say, right?"
"1556880","1560440"," Or, or Twitter chat or our DM or, um, discord."
"1561820","1567240"," And we, we talk on a phone call that, uh, maybe is like through signal or something. "
"1568220","1574880"," Uh, so we have this like, it's not finite, but hey, we're, we're talking and we're done talking."
"1574880","1576540"," We know that that conversation is over."
"1577300","1581460"," And the next time we want to speak, it's another email or DM or something like that. "
"1586450","1587230"," Let's see here."
"1587470","1588450"," What's going on?"
"1596470","1598550"," That same place or keynote, right?"
"1598710","1605590"," There on a consistent downward path in deciding appropriate policy steps at coming meetings."
"1606250","1609450"," That's Bowman says the level of inflation is still unacceptably high. "
"1609450","1614090"," That's Bowman says, I want signs of inflation in a consistent downward path."
"1614690","1617970"," And core inflation has all of 2022."
"1618750","1622770"," That's Bowman says additional policy rate increases will be needed to reach. "
"1623370","1629890"," So just to repeat that, that's Bowman says, additional policy rate increases will be needed to"
"1629890","1633050"," reach sufficiently restrictive level and control inflation."
"1633050","1638470"," That's Bowman says monetary policy has had some effects on the economy, but core inflation has"
"1638470","1639770"," essentially plateaued."
"1640770","1644570"," So we'll be with you this morning, but I do have some calls out to make at the moment. "
"1644930","1648510"," I'll check back in with you guys throughout the daytime."
"1649490","1650410"," So we'll be back."
"1651210","1652650"," And you'll see me here in video and stuff. "
"1653190","1655650"," On my microphone, we meet it as I make calls and make some changes."
"1655650","1662710"," At least with stuff or discord and stuff, some connections with the website and that sort of stuff."

"1892700","1895680"," Danger zone for bulls is right in here. "

"1936600","1940760"," I would not be long low in here you will allow the algorithms to push up. "

"2192870","2197270"," This is live audio of the Senate hearing problem. "
"2197270","2200670"," The feds been fighting it with a blunt tool and we made progress."
"2200990","2206210"," Inflation is at the lowest level in the last two years giving hope that the price of consumer goods"
"2206210","2207670"," will continue to decline."
"2208390","2211230"," And despite the experts prediction job growth remains strong. "
"2211810","2214770"," The country added 339,000 new jobs in May."
"2215350","2220290"," Ohio's unemployment rate 3.6 percent is the state's lowest in 20 years."
"2220930","2226690"," Unemployment for black and brown Americans remain near remains near historic lows. "
"2226690","2233410"," Think about what actually means for workers in Alabama and Ohio and North Dakota and Louisiana and"
"2233410","2234790"," Minnesota and South Carolina."
"2235590","2238130"," What that actually means for workers all over the country."
"2238290","2242810"," It means Americans have more opportunity and choice in their lives even in places they haven't seen"
"2242810","2244370"," a lot of options in recent years. "
"2244970","2250010"," It means people have the power to demand raises and retirement security and paid sick days and"
"2250010","2251490"," control over their schedules."
"2251490","2257210"," It means more Americans have the dignity of work that comes with a good job that can provide for"
"2257210","2257670"," your family."
"2258610","2262270"," And look where that kind of power for workers is taking us last month. "
"2262790","2264550"," Wage growth outpaced inflation."
"2265270","2266210"," That's the way it should be."
"2266690","2268750"," Today's hearing comes at a critical time. "
"2268910","2274430"," Last week the Fed decided to pause interest rate hikes after 10 consecutive increases and to"
"2274430","2276250"," maintain the rate at its current level."
"2276250","2281330"," For the many of us who are concerned that further rate hikes could do more harm than good, it's"
"2281330","2281890"," welcome news."
"2282370","2287250"," The challenge you face, Chair Powell is to ensure that workers continue to see higher wages while"
"2287250","2289190"," also continuing to rein in inflation. "
"2290130","2295530"," In previous hearings you've noted with justifiable pride how careful management of the economy"
"2295530","2298290"," helped millions of workers return to the job market."
"2298290","2304570"," It's those workers who stand to lose the most if the Fed over does its rate hikes, loses sight of"
"2304570","2307670"," the dual mandate and drives the unemployment rate back up."
"2308210","2313290"," If you've also noted Mr. Chair, increasing interest rates is not the only tool we have to inflate"
"2313290","2313890"," inflation. "
"2314290","2318770"," The Fed is not the only one with the role to play, Congress administration, everyone in government"
"2318770","2321410"," and corporate boardrooms must do their part."
"2321830","2325350"," There's no reason we can't continue coming together to bring prices down."
"2325350","2330670"," More policy makers are finally recognizing what those of us in Ohio have known for years that"
"2330670","2336230"," outsourcing, outsourcing the production of pretty much everything may mean higher profits in the"
"2336230","2341550"," short term, but it won't lead to a resilient economy with a strong middle class in the long term. "
"2342010","2346950"," We've taken steps to strengthen our supply chains in hiring and bringing critical manufacturing"
"2346950","2351430"," back to the U.S. and the BIPARS and infrastructure law a number of things."
"2351790","2357030"," We must continue that progress instead of lowering demand, which is just economics textbook jargon"
"2357030","2361090"," for making people poor, laying off workers, denying raises."
"2361450","2362090"," It's not lowering demand. "
"2362390","2363110"," We can produce more."
"2363250","2363910"," We can build more."
"2364410","2366150"," We can grow the economy from the middle out. "
"2367190","2372550"," It's also our first semi-annual report from the Fed since the string of bank failures this spring."
"2372550","2377670"," Those failures were caused by the same issue at the heart of so many of our economic problems."
"2377990","2379310"," It's the Wall Street business model. "
"2379950","2381310"," Executives lay off workers."
"2381870","2388150"," They put short-term increases in quarterly profits and their own compensation above everything and"
"2388150","2388930"," everyone else."
"2389490","2394830"," At Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, those in charge pushed their banks to grow too big, too"
"2394830","2395150"," fast. "
"2395390","2396370"," They made risky bets."
"2398110","2398750"," They got massive profits."
"2399310","2404330"," Executives were paying themselves bonuses right up until the moment that at least one of these"
"2404330","2404950"," banks crashed. "
"2405510","2407150"," To most Americans, that's not surprising."
"2407830","2413870"," People have gotten all too used to big bankers treating the industry more like a game or maybe more"
"2413870","2416130"," precisely an endless ATM for themselves."
"2416670","2420410"," Securing the knowledge they won't pay any real price if things go wrong. "
"2420410","2428830"," As Chairman, as Senator Scott and I teamed up on a 21-2 vote yesterday, those days for bank"
"2428830","2429830"," executives are over."
"2430390","2434330"," Chair Powell, I look forward to hearing today how the federal protect American workers in the fight"
"2434330","2438430"," against inflation and promote an economy with a strong, growing middle class."
"2438870","2439790"," Senator Scott. "
"2440190","2441310"," Thank you, Chairman."
"2441890","2443850"," Chair Powell, thanks for joining us today."
"2444150","2444930"," It's such an important time. "
"2444930","2449430"," Your last appearance before this committee was about four months ago, just days before the collapse"
"2449430","2450110"," of two banks."
"2451050","2455390"," And while we continue to investigate those bank failures, it's important to examine the macro"
"2455390","2459870"," factors such as rising interest rates that contributed to the bank failures and the current"
"2459870","2462930"," economic stresses American families face every single day."
"2464050","2469850"," Looking through the lens, I want to turn to you, in your role as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, a"
"2469850","2474790"," role that requires constant scrutiny because the American people deserve nothing less than the best"
"2474790","2475690"," we can offer them. "
"2476270","2480570"," The greatest opportunity to succeed and the strongest tools to pave their path."
"2481210","2486530"," Unfortunately, the bank failures earlier this year should confidence in our financial system."
"2487270","2493590"," But thankfully, our healthy and well-managed institutions stepped up and we have been able to"
"2493590","2494230"," weather the storm. "
"2494230","2501090"," However, I've been consistently disappointed in your deputy Vice Chair of Supervision, Michael"
"2501090","2501270"," Barr."
"2501790","2508670"," Just yesterday, this committee passed, as Chairman Brown just said, near unanimous legislation to"
"2508670","2512870"," encourage good corporate governance, but not just that."
"2513170","2517630"," We also wanted to focus on the supervisory failure that was a part of the legislation. "
"2518550","2523250"," Those are not the same actions taken by Michael Barr."
"2523250","2527970"," I asked him twice when he was here before the committee."
"2528390","2534270"," If he would fire bad bank supervisors for the supervisory neglect that contributed to the epic"
"2534270","2539290"," failures of SVB and signature, he would not commit to doing anything. "
"2540030","2545750"," And I would ask you in your role as the active executive officer, if you would take some action"
"2545750","2555370"," firing those responsible for missing what was clearly obvious, now to all of"
"2555370","2559550"," America certainly should have been obvious to the supervisors."
"2562470","2568330"," I've said from the beginning that this has been a failure in three parts, the SVB and signature."
"2568690","2572510"," It was a failure of the bank execs, the action that we took 21"
"2572510","2582250"," to two yesterday, the second failure was a"
"2582250","2583250"," supervisory failure. "
"2583670","2588250"," And that requires the Fed to hold folks accountable, just like Congress did."
"2588550","2596050"," And third, the Biden inflationary economy, it has drove prices really high and resulted."
"2596470","2600230"," All right, so you see here the sort of testing now, the hourly trigger. "
"2600750","2604270"," We had some failures on the hourly trigger in previous instances."
"2604470","2609430"," This is the place where the sellers have stepped in."
"2610030","2614530"," To the market, we said this morning that Thursday and Fridays. "
"2615110","2616650"," So Thursdays are usually green."
"2617650","2624990"," If Thursdays are not green, it's like an 85% chance of green on Friday."
"2625430","2628870"," So you're seeing it right now, the test up here. "
"2629670","2635170"," And what I'm going to do here for you is bring up the trigger so you can look at it"
"2635170","2635790"," for yourself."
"2636250","2637950"," And I'll leave it up here on the screen."
"2639150","2644390"," So you can see the interplay here while this is happening in real time. "
"2644490","2648270"," I'm actually going to move this into a one minute chart so you guys can see it."
"2649310","2651930"," If you are a bull, you should be taking profit here."
"2652790","2653910"," You take profit right here. "
"2654830","2655830"," Price is above."
"2656590","2659610"," If a bull cross, price above, confirmation, move higher."
"2660550","2661570"," Another confirmation here. "
"2662650","2664430"," You'd be taking the money and running here."
"2665180","2670110"," And then you wait for price to break above and retest."
"2670690","2673610"," So I'm going to show you what you're looking for here if you're a bull. "
"2673850","2676670"," Looking for a break above, down."
"2677530","2682190"," And then you're waiting for the one in five minutes to catch back up to take this trade even"
"2682190","2682490"," higher."
"2683370","2684490"," So we'll be looking for this here. "
"2685330","2690790"," And this here, this will form a three trigger bull cluster."
"2691370","2699230"," And you will see if this happens, you will see a consolidation here and a move higher."
"2699430","2703010"," You will not enter another bull trade unless you see this happen. "
"2703850","2704790"," All right."
"2704930","2708630"," Now, if you see this happen here, this is when it becomes the actual bull cluster of the upside."
"2709270","2710590"," This is a very explosive move. "
"2711350","2713770"," And that would be a daily trend all day long."
"2714030","2714850"," So keep your eyes on this."
"2715570","2722970"," There can be a moment or two before that white line gets up here to get for continuation. "
"2724050","2729910"," But if we do begin to stay above this hourly trigger and you see the consolidation and then the"
"2729910","2738890"," move higher, as the move begins, this becomes like an 89% probable trade that it's going to print"
"2738890","2739870"," some really fat money."
"2740050","2742390"," You can go into this with some serious size."
"2742390","2748070"," So you need to see this five, one minute and five minute come up here, okay, in the confirmation"
"2748070","2748830"," trade higher. "
"2749170","2750490"," It does present itself today."
"2750990","2759410"," We are going to close that shit up there at 4.37 and likely close the gaps up here at"
"2759410","2767290"," 4.37.33 and 4.39.61 and likely 4.41.81 by Friday."
"2767950","2769970"," So you get a nice explosive two day move. "
"2770750","2772710"," It could take one day, it could take two days."
"2773010","2774430"," It looks like it's happening right now."
"2774930","2778570"," So I'll leave this, I'm going to leave this up in the one minute chart for you to see how"
"2778570","2778910"," it works. "
"2779450","2788570"," I do want you to be aware that the hourly, there's an hourly exhaustion point here for sellers."
"2789650","2792950"," And we could lead to a big trend day to the upside here."
"2793570","2797730"," I'm going to leave this up here for you to watch as they continue to speak at the Senate hearing. "
"2797730","2804050"," And I want you to be able to see what I'm talking about here above this move right here."
"2804430","2807810"," So we're beginning to squeeze above the hourly trigger to the upside."
"2808650","2811130"," We're looking for a retest called the kiss trade. "
"2812350","2820650"," We do as we squeeze above, smash above, come back down and we get this big, huge continuation move"
"2820650","2821110"," to the upside."
"2822070","2824870"," While the jobs to workers gap as needed."
"2824910","2827730"," Leave this up for you right now so you can continue to watch this. "
"2827970","2829930"," The supply of available workers."
"2831510","2835530"," Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2%."
"2836110","2838350"," Over the 12 months ending in April. "
"2838890","2843330"," By the way, if price holds, ready for this?"
"2843610","2848850"," Price holds 435.62, 435.62 is right in there."
"2848850","2852010"," We're going to get a monster fucking move to the upside."
"2852770","2855290"," It's just waiting for the one in five to catch up to it. "
"2856570","2857650"," And it'll be beautiful."
"2857850","2864610"," And the core CPI was 5.3%. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year."
"2865130","2867690"," Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high. "
"2868390","2873370"," And the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go."
"2874450","2879490"," Despite elevated inflation, longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored as"
"2879490","2885250"," reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as"
"2885250","2886610"," measures from financial markets."
"2888230","2893450"," With inflation remaining well above our longer run goal of 2% and with labor market conditions"
"2893450","2898470"," remaining tight, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. "
"2898470","2903550"," We have raised our policy interest rate by 5% points since early last year."
"2904370","2907990"," And we've continued to reduce our security holdings at a brisk pace."
"2909030","2913510"," We've been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate"
"2913510","2914970"," sensitive sectors of the economy. "
"2915790","2920610"," It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially"
"2920610","2921390"," on inflation."
"2923590","2928010"," The economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which"
"2928010","2930930"," are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation."
"2931670","2933790"," The extent of these effects remains uncertain. "
"2935270","2939590"," In light of how far we have come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary"
"2939590","2945370"," policy affects the economy and potential headwinds from credit tightening, the FOMC decided last"
"2945370","2951490"," week to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5.25%. There's a little bit"
"2951490","2952130"," of concern here."
"2952190","2954870"," I don't like seeing this 5-minute curl over."
"2955230","2955870"," See this right here?"
"2955950","2957350"," I was rolling. "
"2957950","2958790"," I don't like seeing that."
"2959350","2961510"," I would really like to see this 5-minute."
"2961710","2963390"," Just keep pumping higher. "
"2964270","2965490"," Be really wary here right now."
"2966430","2968270"," I'm going to chattery reverse this."
"2969210","2970270"," Keep your eye here. "
"2970670","2973490"," Price must remain above the green line."
"2973910","2975450"," Must remain above that green line."
"2975450","2979830"," I'm determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation"
"2979830","2981190"," to 2% over time. "
"2981970","2986510"," We will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy the lags with which monetary"
"2986510","2991370"," policy affects economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments."
"2992310","2997290"," We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting based on the totality of incoming data"
"2997290","3002810"," and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance"
"3002810","3003290"," of risks."
"3003290","3009250"," We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keeping longer term"
"3009250","3011110"," inflation expectations well anchored. "
"3011930","3017430"," Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below trend growth and some softening of labor"
"3017430","3018190"," market conditions."
"3018990","3025310"," Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable"
"3025310","3026790"," prices over the long run."
"3027530","3031470"," Before concluding, let me briefly address the condition of the banking sector. "
"3032050","3034590"," The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient."
"3035270","3040590"," As detailed in the box on financial stability in the June monetary policy report, the Federal"
"3040590","3045730"," Reserve, together with the Treasury Department and the FDIC, took decisive action in March to"
"3045730","3049730"," protect the U.S. economy and to strengthen public confidence in our banking system."
"3050450","3054670"," The recent bank failures, including the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and the resulting bank"
"3054670","3059850"," stress, have highlighted the importance of ensuring that we have the appropriate rules and"
"3059850","3062490"," supervisory practices for banks of this size. "
"3063170","3067390"," We're committed to addressing these vulnerabilities to make for a stronger and more resilient"
"3067390","3068310"," banking system."
"3069450","3074990"," To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the"
"3074990","3075330"," country."
"3075870","3078230"," Everything we do is in service to our public mission. "
"3078890","3083630"," We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability"
"3083630","3084050"," goals."
"3084050","3085230"," Thank you."
"3086750","3087970"," Thank you, Chair Powell. "
"3091260","3096600"," Paul Donovan at UBS has discussed the role that corporate profiteering plays and persistent"
"3096600","3097120"," inflation."
"3097880","3102360"," Well, inflation has risen, it's fallen from 9% as you know, it has peaked to 4%."
"3102360","3108060"," Prices continue to climb because of supply shortages and corporate profiteering what we're starting"
"3108060","3109320"," to call greedflation. "
"3110020","3115740"," Given that rising interest rates certainly won't solve greedflation, why maintain interest rates at"
"3115740","3120580"," the current level or even consider as you've suggested raising them again, given the risk of"
"3120580","3123820"," harming the livelihoods of more than a million and a half workers and their families?"
"3126340","3134220"," Mr. Chairman, the Committee broadly feels that while monetary policy has gotten to an appropriately"
"3134220","3140180"," restrictive level, if the economy performs about as expected, that it will be appropriate to raise"
"3140180","3143080"," hikes again this year and perhaps twice."
"3143380","3146760"," A strong majority of the Committee feels that it will be appropriate again assuming that the"
"3146760","3150320"," economy performs as expected two times before the end of this year."
"3151020","3156880"," We've come very far and the reason why we maintained our rate at the last meeting was to give"
"3156880","3161240"," ourselves more time to stretch out the time for making these decisions. "
"3161240","3166960"," We moved very quickly at the beginning and we gradually slowed down, this is just a continuation of"
"3166960","3173000"," that, but we are committed to getting inflation under control and the strong majority of the"
"3173000","3176200"," Committee feels that we're close, but there's a little further to go with rate hikes."
"3176660","3183940"," Well, thank you for that answer, but Mr. Chair, what Fed governors call cooling down regular people"
"3183940","3185320"," where I live, call them layoffs."
"3185320","3190160"," I mean, the question is, why should working families continue to bear the cost of fighting"
"3190160","3190360"," inflation?"
"3190500","3194160"," Why should they lose their jobs so that corporate profits can continue to balloon?"
"3194780","3195800"," Let me move to the next question. "
"3196000","3201340"," Our economy has created 13 million, I'm sorry, 13 million new jobs in the last two and a half"
"3201340","3201560"," years."
"3202300","3207120"," Black and Latino workers, workers with the lowest incomes have seen the greatest gains in job"
"3207120","3208900"," opportunity and wage growth."
"3208900","3215160"," What the Fed considers too hot an economy is given these workers their first leg up in decades, if"
"3215160","3215380"," ever. "
"3215860","3219040"," We know the job losses will hurt those same workers the most."
"3219680","3225140"," How will higher interest rates and the resulting job losses disproportionately impact black and"
"3225140","3226780"," Latino and low income workers?"
"3228760","3235200"," Well, we have quite an unusual situation in the labor market where we've had persistently much"
"3235200","3238940"," higher demand for workers than the available supply of workers."
"3239700","3247040"," So some of the process of getting demand and supply back into alignment has been taking place"
"3247040","3255400"," through declining job openings and through lower quits rates and through wages that are still very"
"3255400","3258920"," high but moving into more sustainable levels of increase. "
"3258920","3263140"," So actually there hasn't been a meaningful increase in unemployment."
"3263620","3268300"," The unemployment rate has bounced around at historically low levels and that's fine."
"3268620","3272300"," That would be the perfect way for this to continue to happen. "
"3272500","3273880"," There's no guarantee that will happen."
"3274240","3279820"," I would just say that it is working families who suffer most directly and quickly from high"
"3279820","3280400"," inflation."
"3280560","3285520"," It is for the benefit of those people and all other people that we need to restore 2% inflation"
"3285520","3287340"," in this country on a sustained basis. "
"3287340","3288540"," And thank you."
"3288620","3294900"," But in the dual mandate suggests that those workers that obviously you look out for those jobs and"
"3294900","3295340"," those workers."
"3295380","3298860"," But we also know that those workers are the first to be laid off. "
"3299020","3301460"," And I would hope that in your next meeting the Fed."
"3301800","3304760"," So just a note here while you're watching this in the background."
"3305520","3307900"," You would have no position here. "
"3308120","3310500"," So you don't take any position here."
"3311380","3315200"," You let this you let this here work itself out."
"3316140","3320600"," So if you're looking for a position here you see the prices below the hourly trigger. "
"3320980","3326780"," You're waiting for what you're waiting for is for this white line to catch up and for this red line"
"3326780","3328040"," to catch up."
"3328420","3330800"," Kind of like faltering here."
"3331200","3332840"," So it does begin to catch up. "
"3333320","3338640"," And if price begins to work its way higher here starts to push its way higher."
"3339480","3341640"," And you begin to see the cross take place here."
"3341640","3345520"," I want you to note this white line right here as it comes up. "
"3345900","3349380"," You should see price begin to push higher here."
"3350680","3352940"," And this red line should continue higher."
"3353120","3358460"," And this is going to be the beginnings of a larger trade to the upside. "
"3359060","3365580"," You do not enter this trade ever until price confirms and is higher than this hourly trigger right"
"3365580","3365740"," here."
"3365740","3371280"," So this 435 is a key level for you if you're looking for continuation to the upside."
"3371880","3376820"," I want to also warn you that not warn you but let you know that as this takes place here"
"3376820","3384520"," right now this continuation will be explosive for a period of time like all day long like 230 in"
"3384520","3388140"," the afternoon possibly even into the close tomorrow. "
"3388140","3393840"," So it's not like you need to grab one like you don't have to have this one fucking tick right"
"3393840","3394100"," here."
"3394280","3398200"," You can wait for it to begin to push higher and wait for this line to come up."
"3398460","3402680"," Wait for this line to come up and just confirm the three trigger bullish cluster. "
"3403640","3407460"," There's no like requirement that you are on this trade."
"3407640","3408860"," There are some rules on this trade."
"3409420","3411020"," Most of you should already know them. "
"3411060","3415240"," You can let each other know inside of the stream what they are that you're going to want to."
"3415240","3421720"," Every time we recheck we want to be checking that white line right check it every 15 minutes every"
"3421720","3426580"," half an hour every hour that kind of stuff every 45 minutes as we go higher."
"3427460","3431880"," And there will be an attempt to close if it goes higher there will be an attempt to close. "
"3431880","3436740"," There's been a proposal that's been circulated but it's in my mind."
"3437400","3443800"," I know things are still an attempt to close 436.80. There'll be an attempt to close."
"3444520","3451460"," The capital increases that are getting so much 437.35. There'll be some volatility in here. "
"3451700","3457460"," Some capital increases in the beginning attempt to close this up here 439.60. And believe it or not"
"3457460","3458600"," way up here by Friday."
"3458600","3464820"," On yesterday you said 441.95. The eight largest banks to have high levels up here."
"3465160","3466160"," Very high levels of capital. "
"3466280","3467200"," All that shit up there."
"3467560","3468640"," You stand by that statement."
"3468880","3470880"," So you're looking for this to see if it happens. "
"3471380","3474080"," If the south side right now does not want to see this happen."
"3474260","3477320"," The south side does not want to see this break above."
"3477640","3480620"," If this break above is successful and you're short. "
"3481280","3484960"," Just be very very careful because this stuff gets."
"3484960","3488640"," This stuff becomes like an unstoppable force to the upside."
"3489100","3491800"," If you're south side this is where you're selling right here. "
"3492500","3495860"," I want you to know that there is an hourly shift happening right now."
"3496140","3498800"," You can see this hourly is trying to turn around."
"3499420","3501440"," You can even see it already beginning to happen. "
"3502420","3506340"," And this is the expectation as each hour goes forward."
"3507080","3508660"," Bam, bam, bam."
"3508940","3510380"," No confirmation yet. "
"3512360","3513440"," Speak careful of it."
"3513700","3515480"," If price begins to trade higher."
"3516800","3521240"," In your short might be time to take some profit and look to re-enter a short later on. "
"3521480","3523960"," It seems to be the rate of failure on a high or something like that."
"3524240","3526380"," Want any of these resistance levels up on high."
"3527500","3529520"," It is building for an explosive move though. "
"3529920","3531400"," If you're on south side watch out."
"3531760","3537860"," The lower the capital for the private sector which means fewer loans and less capital for those who"
"3537860","3539360"," are actually creating jobs."
"3539360","3546080"," And so when we have too much capital on the sidelines then we have too little capital for actually"
"3546080","3549420"," creating and producing a vibrant economy. "
"3549740","3550580"," One other note here too."
"3551040","3553460"," If you are looking for a short position here."
"3554400","3555520"," What you're looking for. "
"3555860","3557560"," I'll show you exactly what you're looking for for a short position."
"3558560","3559440"," For confirmation."
"3559840","3561660"," If you're like hey no fucking cap or going down. "
"3562560","3564700"," Bears told me we're selling the market in the world."
"3564700","3569120"," Then you're looking for a rejection here."
"3569800","3571280"," I'm going to show you what you're looking for. "
"3571380","3573040"," This is going to represent price."
"3573320","3573740"," What I do next."
"3574180","3577020"," We're looking for a rejection down here. "
"3577460","3578800"," Particularly the largest banks."
"3579140","3579820"," Something like this."
"3580380","3581100"," Something like this. "
"3581460","3582860"," And then you would enter the trade."
"3583200","3585240"," The downside over here."
"3585820","3587780"," Even preferable down here. "
"3588340","3591400"," Like 4.30. 75ish."
"3591640","3593480"," Or excuse me 4.33. 75ish."
"3593820","3595460"," That would be my entry there. "
"3595920","3597200"," Maybe looking for a rejection."
"3598340","3599120"," And then a couple of graphs."
"3599660","3601380"," A couple of graphs of air. "
"3602020","3603520"," And then a continuation to the downside."
"3604760","3607320"," So there's no real short trade for you here at the moment either."
"3607840","3609800"," You're just looking for the rejection at this point. "
"3610540","3612660"," We are looking like we're going to get explosive here in a few moments."
"3612660","3615880"," What's your fucking seat belts on bulls?"
"3618080","3623860"," Wage increase minus inflation has led to less spending power."
"3624920","3626080"," Do you disagree with that?"
"3626440","3627160"," No, I think that's right. "
"3627680","3634700"," So in the end, as we celebrate what seems to be a healthy economy, the truth of the matter is"
"3634700","3638880"," that the average person in our nation today struggles to make their ends meet because of"
"3638880","3639500"," inflationary."
"3639500","3640880"," One more second here."
"3640920","3643600"," I'm going to do one more thing for you guys. "
"3643940","3646160"," Put you back on the regular charts you guys are used to."
"3647240","3648840"," So I want to check for you."
"3649000","3654280"," Make sure I got just in case we're going to do this rip faces off rally here today. "
"3655340","3657160"," Put your calls in and."
"3658260","3658740"," Differently."
"3659020","3662120"," I'm going to put some use for servicing our debt. "
"3662480","3664620"," Less money we have for meeting."
"3664980","3665460"," There's one."
"3666800","3667440"," There's one. "
"3668300","3669040"," There's one."
"3669360","3671840"," Printing and spending $4 trillion."
"3672860","3676200"," There's one giant fucking gap up here. "
"3676480","3678700"," As led to the inflation that we're seeing."
"3678900","3680160"," All that shit needs filled in."
"3680680","3683220"," All that shit is filled in right there. "
"3683420","3685660"," How do you as chairman of the."
"3685840","3686300"," It's our three."
"3686740","3687800"," Talk to policy. "
"3687800","3689100"," There's your last one up there."
"3690140","3691520"," There's the other two up here."
"3691960","3694640"," Being responsible from a monetary perspective. "
"3694640","3697880"," I know I've seen and heard your comments that that's not your lane."
"3698160","3701200"," But certainly the actions that we take here."
"3701860","3702380"," Impacts. "
"3702820","3705300"," Here's your bull cross happening right now."
"3705880","3707140"," See it right there."
"3708120","3711640"," Here's your bull cross reversal to the upside inflation. "
"3713040","3714940"," Let me start by see it right there."
"3715140","3717340"," We're talking about real wages a moment ago."
"3717580","3718040"," Real wages. "
"3718200","3720100"," You're looking for this like check right here."
"3720980","3724540"," Now they are for this like bam, bam, bam, bam."
"3724760","3726280"," Then start ripping some faces off. "
"3726440","3733140"," You know I would just say this that the US federal budget is on an unsustainable path."
"3733240","3734780"," It has been so for a long time."
"3735080","3736640"," We need to check it out in one minute chart. "
"3736920","3739640"," See the check happening right now."
"3740600","3742140"," See right here in one minute chart."
"3742580","3744360"," Explosive move for the bulls here in the open. "
"3744840","3745740"," One minute chart."
"3746860","3748360"," And they're going to recheck this right now."
"3748360","3750680"," I'm going to put you back on the five minute. "
"3750720","3752960"," It's a high level matter from the standpoint of the economy."
"3753140","3753920"," That yellow represents."
"3755420","3757600"," Here's the white line on the tool. "
"3758280","3760260"," This yellow line is representing that white line."
"3760400","3761860"," This is showing you the way is up."
"3762180","3763920"," Like if my line moves the upside. "
"3764480","3766940"," Be very fucking careful if you're a bear."
"3767080","3768200"," I'm going to say something to the line."
"3768840","3769860"," At some point. "
"3771220","3776280"," I think it's your responsibility to talk about the importance of fiscal responsibility."
"3777060","3777940"," That to the side."
"3778140","3785760"," My last thought the question for you is that S.V.B. suffered because their bond portfolio ended up"
"3785760","3789200"," carrying water in a negative way. "
"3789940","3798180"," You have a $8 trillion balance sheet in beyond every report that I've read is that your bond"
"3798180","3801340"," portfolio our bond portfolio the Fed is under water as well."
"3802080","3806500"," Can you talk to me about the losses that you're experiencing at the Fed."
"3806780","3814400"," Remember that the way it works at the Fed is when we buy assets during QE. "
"3814980","3819160"," We pay for them with overnight interest rate reserves."
"3820460","3825660"," And we've for many many years during the QE era we've earned a spread and we've been sending money"
"3825660","3829060"," to the treasury way over a trillion dollars since QE started."
"3829060","3833800"," And so now that race is going back up to 5% that process has reversed. "
"3835040","3840820"," And these are paper losses they have absolutely no effect on our ability to conduct monetary policy"
"3840820","3841820"," or really on the economy."
"3842320","3844240"," It's just it's an accounting fact."
"3844400","3847920"," If we retained capital then that would be a different would look completely different. "
"3848080","3851080"," But we don't we give all of our profits to the to the treasury."
"3851440","3855600"," So you were giving profits to the treasury now you're not that has an actual effect."
"3856360","3859540"," If I was getting 10 bucks now I'm not that there's an effect. "
"3860140","3864720"," Well the treasury then will have to have to borrow money that it doesn't get or raise taxes."
"3865000","3870140"," It'll have to get the money just to you know carry out the spending that that Congress authorizes."
"3870380","3874140"," But that's not going to really it's not going to be in it's not going to affect interest rates and"
"3874140","3874940"," things like that much. "
"3875740","3881260"," To me I have the holistic view of our economy where if in fact we have more fewer dollars coming"
"3881260","3886720"," in which requires us to raise taxes that in the end has a real impact on American taxpayers."
"3887160","3887640"," But thank you."
"3888100","3888600"," Thank you. "
"3888920","3889460"," Senator Scott."
"3889660","3890840"," Senator Menendez from New Jersey."
"3891260","3892060"," Thank you, Chairman. "
"3892360","3895440"," After announcing the rate hike pause last week."
"3896020","3900260"," You said that inflation has not reacted much to the feds past hikes."
"3901340","3903960"," And I'll admit I'm a bit puzzled by that statement. "
"3903960","3912020"," The feds first rate hike was in March of last year when non core inflation was at 8.6%. It"
"3912020","3916320"," is now 4% and core inflation has fallen as well."
"3917100","3922120"," So that sounds like progress to me especially when you consider that according to the San Francisco"
"3922120","3923000"," Federal Reserve."
"3923560","3928220"," It can take more than a year for tax rake hikes to take full effect. "
"3928220","3934740"," Which means that so far only 3 of the 10 rate hikes since last year are in full effect."
"3935300","3939300"," So can you expand a bit more on that statement from last week?"
"3939460","3944040"," What progress do you expect to see that you currently aren't seeing?"
"3944420","3944860"," Sure."
"3945180","3947040"," So of course you're absolutely right. "
"3947360","3949760"," Headline inflation has come down by essentially half."
"3950340","3955500"," But that's largely due to energy prices coming down and commodity prices that go into food coming"
"3955500","3955820"," down."
"3956560","3962160"," I won't say that they're not affected at all by monetary policy but they're principally affected by"
"3962160","3963800"," other things in the economy. "
"3964200","3968600"," The war in Ukraine drove energy prices up quite a bit and also food prices."
"3969960","3974760"," Those things are not principally a function of monetary policy although we probably have some"
"3974760","3975540"," effect at the margin."
"3976120","3980340"," So we look at core inflation and we look at how tight the economy is. "
"3981020","3985940"," We are seeing progress for example in supply chains getting better."
"3986140","3988400"," That again is not really a function of monetary policy."
"3988620","3994160"," Really where monetary policy takes effect is in the service sector and that's where we haven't seen"
"3994160","3994920"," much progress. "
"3995740","3998160"," But we are seeing progress in other places as you point out."
"3998320","4003060"," Inflation broadly is coming down but as I said in my remarks we still have a long way to go."
"4003180","4010180"," Inflation is still running between 4% and 5%. "
"4010180","4014360"," Has lengthened or are rate hikes as a monetary policy too becoming less effective?"
"4015280","4019300"," I don't think they're becoming less effective but these are real questions."
"4019980","4025960"," The thing with lags is this day and age financial conditions react before we act."
"4026640","4029700"," So the markets are already pricing and rate hikes so that's quicker. "
"4030360","4034000"," But the effect of those financial conditions on the economy still takes time."
"4034000","4039660"," It works very quickly on housing for example but less so on the service sector which is not very"
"4039660","4040480"," interest sensitive."
"4040900","4043420"," So I don't think that that has changed. "
"4043420","4047680"," Others have a different view and different directions they think in which it's changed."
"4048520","4055300"," There's also there's not a consensus agreement on how long monetary policy takes to effect the"
"4055300","4055600"," economy."
"4055880","4057840"," So some people think a very long time. "
"4058000","4058940"," Some people think right away."
"4058940","4063300"," So I tend to think let's look at the middle of that and you know a year or in changes."
"4064620","4069380"," That's not a bad way to look at it but policy actually started tightening well before that before. "
"4069740","4074500"," We didn't raise rates until March but policy had already tightened substantially before the first"
"4074500","4075660"," rate hike in March."
"4075920","4079800"," Well I will say I know that you have a dual mandate you know that as well."
"4080340","4084480"," The last jobs report shows that unemployment is starting to take upward for women and African"
"4084480","4085020"," Americans. "
"4085020","4092980"," So I hope that the cure is not more consequential than what we're trying to achieve."
"4094480","4101300"," Recent reports reported that there's almost $1.5 trillion in commercial mortgages that will come"
"4101300","4102540"," due in the next two years."
"4103040","4108740"," Many of them held by small and regional lenders with property values declining and interest rates"
"4108740","4109220"," rising. "
"4110080","4113140"," These mortgages could be serious liabilities for many banks."
"4113140","4119340"," Do you think that we may see some banks fail as these mortgages come due and if so what can"
"4119340","4121920"," we do ahead of time to prevent that scenario?"
"4122500","4126859"," So we're of course we're spending a lot of time on these issues and we have been for quite some"
"4126859","4127180"," time."
"4127720","4129680"," And again I think you put your finger on it. "
"4129819","4136420"," It's really which banks have concentrations high concentrations of real estate and that is not seen"
"4136420","4137120"," in the large banks."
"4137880","4139720"," It's seen in some of the smaller banks."
"4139720","4145880"," So we've identified those banks and there's a supervisory toolkit where we work with banks to try"
"4145880","4153380"," to help them resolve those issues by raising capital or dealing with what's happening. "
"4153380","4156420"," And of course what is happening in the office space nationally."
"4157080","4159760"," There's an issue with people working from home and just less demand."
"4160479","4162500"," There's a sort of one time adjustment going on. "
"4162899","4167020"," There are also some other pockets of commercial real estate where there's some softness."
"4167020","4169560"," So we're working with banks to work our way through this."
"4169760","4172080"," We're very aware and very focused on the problem. "
"4172380","4174779"," Well I'm concerned that it's a ticking time bomb."
"4175740","4181760"," And let me just say that last week you said that commercial real estate risks are unlikely to pose"
"4181760","4186080"," a systemic risk because the loans are broadly spread and mostly held by smaller banks."
"4186080","4191620"," But how can we ensure that the potential losses in the commercial real estate don't lead to the"
"4191620","4197640"," draining of assets from smaller, at mid-sized banks and then create further consolidation in the"
"4197640","4203000"," banking sector that brings us back to, I don't want to be back to 2008 when I was here and"
"4203000","4204420"," was asked to do extraordinary things. "
"4204420","4207060"," We certainly don't want to be there either."
"4207460","4212700"," And so we're being pretty proactive about reaching out to these institutions and trying to help"
"4212700","4214980"," them get through these significant issues."
"4216580","4219140"," Again, it's not all smaller banks. "
"4219340","4222760"," It's just some of them have high concentrations in real estate."
"4222960","4227040"," And it's not in the large banks, which of course was where the problem was in 2008 and 2009."
"4227880","4228700"," Thank you, Mr. Chair. "
"4229280","4229760"," Thanks."
"4229880","4233120"," Senator Kennedy of Louisiana is recognized for five minutes."
"4233120","4235060"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman. "
"4235720","4238520"," Thank you for being here, Mr. Chairman and to your colleagues."
"4238840","4242560"," Thanks to all of you for giving so much to our country."
"4242780","4248240"," As you know, our fiscal year, our meaning of the federal government's fiscal year begins October 1."
"4249160","4251400"," We're in the process of putting together a budget. "
"4253960","4261720"," If we pass a budget, we meaning Congress passes a budget that increases spending by, let's say,"
"4263640","4266220"," 10%, roughly $650 billion."
"4267220","4269200"," What will be the impact on inflation?"
"4270560","4280220"," So if it depends on, of course, if it were funded by tax increases or other spending cuts, I guess"
"4280220","4281460"," in your hypothetical, it's not."
"4281580","4286320"," So I think deficit spending at the margin stimulates the economy at the margin. "
"4286580","4287500"," It's a big economy, though."
"4287860","4289500"," And what will be the impact on inflation?"
"4289500","4296300"," It would be, it would probably be a small effect on inflation ultimately, but there would be an"
"4296300","4303440"," effect through stimulation of the economy between, it would be more demand, which would just in"
"4303440","4308180"," general, I'm not commenting on being, I'm sort of commenting on fiscal policy here, but"
"4308180","4310540"," nonetheless, it would be, there would be an effect on it."
"4310640","4313340"," I'm just asking you about basic economics. "
"4314340","4324360"," I just read a piece by one of your economists from the San Francisco Fed, Mr. Shapiro,"
"4325040","4335780"," who's arguing that labor costs had, had virtually nothing to do with service inflation and"
"4335780","4342680"," a negligible, is a negligible factor in broader inflation."
"4342680","4350600"," And I read this stuff from some of your people and I just wonder what planet they parachuted in"
"4350600","4350900"," from."
"4352900","4362800"," If Congress passes a budget in my prior example that reduces spending by 10%, roughly"
"4362800","4368620"," $650 billion, what impact will that have on inflation?"
"4368620","4374860"," So that would, you know, you'd have less stimulus for demand, and you'd be cutting programs if you"
"4374860","4380120"," did that, and therefore you'd be slowing the economy down, and the impact would be less demand,"
"4380360","4386680"," neither of these ideas affects the supply side at all, so less demand would mean less economic"
"4386680","4390080"," activity, less spending, and that would have a negative effect on inflation. "
"4390080","4398480"," Well, more stimulus by federal spending is inflationary, is that right?"
"4399180","4404940"," It has a, so we've been in this situation where inflation was so stable for 25 years, you remember,"
"4405380","4411820"," and almost nothing that we did mattered for inflation, and it's called the so-called flat Phillips"
"4411820","4415580"," curve, where there just wasn't a connection between how tight the economy is in inflation."
"4416420","4418780"," That does not appear to be the case right now."
"4418780","4423320"," I think many people would say that the Phillips curve is now not so flat, and that there isn't an"
"4423320","4424160"," interaction between. "
"4424180","4427080"," I think that's a yes, yeah."
"4427360","4428760"," It's the economics, you know."
"4428780","4437640"," And less spending by government means less stimulus, which tends to be disinflationary. "
"4438560","4439320"," Is that fair?"
"4440860","4441280"," Okay."
"4442000","4445500"," Let me ask you about the Basal III endgame."
"4445860","4446980"," You know what I'm talking about?"
"4446980","4447580"," I do. "
"4451400","4460670"," There's been some reporting, and of course not everybody has to, not every country has to follow"
"4460670","4462730"," the Basal recommendations."
"4463530","4466430"," The European Union is not following."
"4467410","4473510"," They're going their own way, and we're kind of going our own way in America using the Basal"
"4473510","4483490"," directives as a guidepost, but it's been reported that Fed's going to raise capital requirements"
"4483490","4492520"," by as much as 20%, or excuse me, it's going to raise capital requirements to 20%. "
"4494000","4494760"," Is that right?"
"4495620","4499400"," No, the idea would be to raise them by 20%."
"4500000","4506800"," In other words, if 20% of whatever current capital requirements are, you would raise it by 20% of"
"4506800","4508080"," the total existing amount."
"4508080","4508600"," Okay. "
"4509060","4516660"," So if JB Morgan's cap requirement right now, and let's say 13%, it would go to 15%."
"4516660","4517080"," Right."
"4517280","4517780"," Something like that. "
"4518080","4520240"," If that were to be what happens."
"4520720","4525460"," And this will be for banks $100 billion or more?"
"4525880","4525980"," No."
"4527040","4528520"," There isn't a final proposal. "
"4529040","4530980"," And I know it's still in motion."
"4531280","4532220"," I know things are still changing."
"4532380","4534840"," Yeah, but you folks are talking about everything. "
"4535080","4536080"," You're going to have a lot of input."
"4536080","4537300"," No, that's right."
"4537460","4537680"," That's right. "
"4537920","4545700"," So, but I will say, sorry, what was your question was, are you going to raise capital requirements"
"4545700","4548760"," for 20% to banks $100 billion or more?"
"4549200","4551320"," Are you going to affect community banks as well?"
"4551540","4558980"," No, the capital requirements will be very, very skewed to the eight largest banks, the GSIBs."
"4559320","4561940"," There may be some capital increases for the other banks."
"4561940","4565740"," I think none of this should affect banks under $100 billion. "
"4565980","4567080"," They're really big banks."
"4568200","4570840"," Are they the ones that are at risk right now?"
"4572280","4573060"," They weren't."
"4573160","4575860"," They were a source of strength in a place of strength. "
"4575860","4577260"," They're doing pretty well."
"4577260","4578900"," They're trying to sell you down here, huh?"
"4582180","4585360"," These fucking sellers, man, they're relentless here."
"4585940","4587520"," Look at these fucking guys. "
"4587800","4589040"," They just don't fucking care."
"4589040","4590820"," They're like, get the fuck out of here."
"4595100","4597060"," No trade for bulls up here. "
"4597060","4598120"," I already let you know that earlier."
"4598120","4600180"," So, hopefully none of you were long here."
"4600560","4601980"," You're waiting for the confirmation. "
"4602420","4603240"," There was no confirmation."
"4604360","4610560"," So, for sell side, if you're looking for confirmation to the downside here, you have some sort of"
"4610560","4611820"," confirmation here right now."
"4612020","4617140"," I'm going to bring up the, and bring up the spy chart here. "
"4618700","4624200"," So, if this is now on the bear side, let's say the bears are winning this trade here, you're going"
"4624200","4625720"," to be looking for this right here."
"4625920","4629880"," I drew this out for you just a few moments ago where I said for the sell side, you are"
"4629880","4637140"," looking for this turn here, and you're going to be looking for the white line here to pick up the"
"4637140","4637380"," trade."
"4637960","4641160"," You don't need to have had this trade or any of this stuff right here. "
"4641320","4643920"," You just need to have the confirmation that we're heading lower."
"4643920","4647320"," So, you're going to be looking for a rejection here to the upside."
"4647640","4648880"," You're going to see a couple green bars. "
"4649740","4656420"," And if they, if sellers can drown the buy side, you will see another move to the downside."
"4656420","4660140"," You can jump on the trade right in here once you have confirmation."
"4661100","4664260"," But otherwise, this is all the crazy zone, right?"
"4664600","4670560"," Levels at roughly what they were in the Clinton administration, I mean, which in no way restrained"
"4670560","4673140"," economic growth, the budget would only. "
"4673140","4677520"," If you're a sell side, you can start a short here if you want with a stop above."
"4677980","4678360"," Hold on here."
"4678420","4682760"," I'm going to ask you to comment on that because I know you don't like to comment on fiscal policy,"
"4682760","4683800"," but I feel that that's important. "
"4683960","4684840"," You would need to."
"4684940","4686460"," This would be your stop right here."
"4686560","4690120"," Think about what is driving inflation and. "
"4690420","4691280"," Right about there."
"4691520","4692620"," We are doing about it."
"4693640","4699140"," I have been really struck by how remarkably resilient the labor market has been over the last 16"
"4699140","4702380"," months or so, which is a good thing is we do the work we want to do to grow the"
"4702380","4706080"," middle class and create more opportunity and more financial security for people. "
"4706740","4709680"," If you want my opinion on what I think is going to happen, I think they're going to go to"
"4709680","4711320"," the fucking moon, man, but whatever."
"4712280","4713000"," Historic lows."
"4713320","4714020"," They're trying to sell it. "
"4714220","4717160"," They're like the sellers in this market are kind of wild."
"4717360","4718820"," We'll talk to you guys for a minute."
"4719120","4720520"," Real wage growth has been. "
"4720520","4723400"," I was looking at a I was looking at last night."
"4723520","4725220"," This morning I was looking at was a couple things."
"4725380","4726660"," I'll show you guys some cool, cool, cool things. "
"4726660","4727980"," I was going to do it."
"4728100","4729780"," I was actually going to go on live late last night."
"4729780","4736140"," I was on the phone last night with Winky and I'm going to ask you guys what you think of"
"4736140","4736300"," this. "
"4736780","4738980"," So I want to ask you guys some serious questions here."
"4740860","4742060"," So it's kind of cool."
"4742420","4743720"," A few notes on this market. "
"4744940","4746760"," It's very indicative right now."
"4747480","4753900"," I've got jay or pop on in the background, but I got some fascinating stuff for you guys."
"4755580","4758340"," So when we're in a bull market, a bull run, right?"
"4758640","4761020"," You can tell that they can't sell cash market. "
"4761640","4763160"," All of cash market gets bought."
"4764000","4769680"," You can see when we're in pre market, after hours, Glovex futures."
"4770740","4772620"," That's what all the selling is done, right?"
"4773000","4775220"," To get priced where it needs to be. "
"4775700","4778360"," You're not really seeing major selling in cash market."
"4778460","4779920"," It just isn't happening."
"4780060","4782980"," It's being just being bought, bought, bought. "
"4782980","4787740"," We're down 1.8% after how many down days it's been."
"4788020","4794040"," Half for inflation to continue slowing without us seeing significant jobs."
"4794080","4796720"," One, two, three and four, right?"
"4797800","4800960"," And we've got this giant bull flag here, right?"
"4801740","4808240"," And most of the move that 1.89% or whatever is all in very liquid markets. "
"4808620","4809760"," It's not in cash market."
"4809760","4812940"," There's just like major recovery, major recovery, right?"
"4813060","4818760"," So you're seeing the market be bought, and you're also seeing dealers counter that trade in"
"4818760","4819660"," futures, right?"
"4820280","4823080"," So taking the opposite side of that trade, right?"
"4823480","4828200"," So anyways, the point here is that you're not seeing major cash market selling."
"4828720","4834400"," When we're in negative gamma, when we're in a negative environment, you'll see futures get bought"
"4835500","4837720"," and cash market begin to sell. "
"4838900","4843880"," So we're not seeing that at this moment here in the market, right?"
"4844240","4850960"," So the point here is that traditional charting is leading into something here with you."
"4851640","4853760"," I'm going to show you guys something kind of neat."
"4854080","4857460"," The last few years, we really haven't seen that for 50 years. "
"4857760","4863180"," So we do think it will come up a little bit, but ideally most of the loosening will come in"
"4863180","4864920"," the form of other ways."
"4864920","4872500"," And I was talking to Winky yesterday about the interplay between the tool and bull planes and bear"
"4872500","4872780"," planes."
"4873620","4875700"," So just looking at the spy here, right?"
"4876020","4879440"," If I was going to clean some of this stuff up. "
"4879700","4884700"," So if I was looking at spoons, right, just spy, just very simple, right?"
"4885860","4887020"," I would be like, yeah, you know what?"
"4887180","4888400"," This is extremely bearish."
"4888820","4892780"," And not only is it extremely bearish, so I'm talking to Winky last time."
"4892780","4894960"," I was looking at spy right now. "
"4895300","4896740"," To our part of it is to try."
"4896760","4898060"," I'd be like, yeah, you know what?"
"4898140","4898920"," I'd be warning everybody."
"4898940","4903360"," I'd be like, we're going to have probably one to three down weeks here. "
"4904100","4908360"," So just this cross right here as it was forming."
"4909060","4911480"," And then this cross right here."
"4911680","4912960"," So this cross right here and this cross. "
"4913420","4919760"," So if you may or may not know this, but there's an hourly trend, a four hour trend and a"
"4919760","4922420"," daily and a weekly trend."
"4923320","4926860"," And as you get these crosses, bull or bear, you see this here, bear plane?"
"4927360","4931660"," You can estimate the length of time that the market will be down."
"4932840","4934780"," I think that it's key stuff for you guys to know. "
"4934880","4936460"," Some of you guys know this, but it's a lot of you don't."
"4937000","4940980"," You can estimate if you start to get rejections over here, the downside."
"4941960","4946760"," You can kind of estimate that you can get some downside on an hourly chart for like one week,"
"4946800","4951600"," sometimes to three weeks, but to expect at least a week of down, maybe even two. "
"4952300","4955960"," Four hour trend can be like three weeks to five weeks."
"4956860","4964080"," Daily trend can be month, one to three months of down weekly trend."
"4964540","4966000"," The downside can be many months. "
"4966140","4968940"," So just traditional charting."
"4969020","4970060"," You're looking at this."
"4970340","4973120"," I'm like, man, we're fucking we're turning into bearish here. "
"4973120","4977620"," It's kind of like one of those places where you're kind of like, eh, this is a turn."
"4978940","4981620"," Now sellers have been wrong on these turns."
"4982620","4988140"," If you look at Nasdaq or even, I think even Q shows it, but it's like NDX. "
"4989160","4991600"," You see these same things, right?"
"4991760","4992600"," I want you to see this here."
"4993080","4995600"," You see this cross right here is NDX, right?"
"4996280","4997320"," See that cross right there?"
"4998800","5001660"," And we've had that before, had it right there."
"5002200","5003500"," Had it right over here. "
"5004420","5007480"," And surprise, surprise, boom, a reverse, right?"
"5007660","5009980"," You're expecting that down move for at least a couple of weeks."
"5010360","5011700"," Boom, that down move."
"5012440","5014680"," And we're once again right there. "
"5015020","5017620"," And these sellers are like, fuck you, no, we're going down here."
"5018120","5018680"," Cap, right?"
"5018860","5021760"," We're going to get down to this 14, 652 and cap."
"5022240","5025660"," We're going to roll it over here and get some correction, right?"
"5026800","5028360"," Close all this gap stuff down here. "
"5029080","5032060"," And so if it's not proving itself, right?"
"5032180","5036020"," If these crosses aren't proving themselves, how do you know?"
"5036140","5036780"," How do you get confirmation?"
"5037320","5040180"," There's some velocity stuff you can look at to get that confirmation."
"5041440","5044840"," And so it's a fascinating thing to be looking at, right?"
"5045240","5046320"," It's kind of fascinating here."
"5046760","5053440"," You know that sellers know that if we get above here, what happens is you get explosive moves to"
"5053440","5054060"," the upside. "
"5054560","5056520"," It like just rips faces, right?"
"5056780","5060760"," Weeks and a week, one to three weeks to the upside, one to three weeks to the upside."
"5060760","5065160"," And these sellers don't want to see that because you know that the trend is up."
"5065920","5068100"," Office dog, but hello back to Gus. "
"5070720","5076540"," So just on this point real quick with you, if you're following along, I was talking to Winky last"
"5076540","5078480"," night and I was like, let's look at a ticker, Winky."
"5078620","5084920"," I want to show you something because we're trying to build this stuff into the algorithms on, uh,"
"5085740","5086680"," for you guys, right?"
"5086920","5090060"," And so I'm looking for, I'm looking at pound tear right here."
"5090880","5093380"," PLTR and on more tailoring. "
"5093380","5096660"," And I hope on PLTR and a 30 minute chart."
"5098320","5102800"," Get me to a yes, but a little, a little long of a tooth here."
"5102880","5106820"," One of the concerns I had about that meeting is I think we could look at a lot, a little"
"5106820","5108200"," long of a tooth to me here, right?"
"5108540","5109340"," And think that we're done. "
"5109340","5115320"," And so, but my hourly trend is on the downside and my daily trend is just kind of getting there."
"5115460","5118060"," It's almost like, it's almost like pretty fucking close."
"5118600","5120160"," So does it look bearish?"
"5120580","5121160"," Yeah, it does. "
"5121360","5122680"," But how bearish does it look?"
"5123420","5124820"," Not too bearish."
"5125700","5127540"," Not as bearish you might think."
"5128140","5130560"," It's holding, it's being bought on its monthly. "
"5131480","5139140"," Daily trend is like the boss man and truly weekly trend is a boss man as well."
"5139140","5140080"," And it's trending up."
"5140680","5144100"," So weekly trend is telling me, nope, we're bullish on pound tear. "
"5144180","5145200"," We're just looking for a dip to buy."
"5145640","5148140"," And daily trend is like, fuck you, we're holding this."
"5148240","5153220"," And even if we have a momentary down, we're going to be, we're just looking for a dip to buy. "
"5153560","5157880"," So we're looking for a dip to buy on 14 bucks, possibly a dip to buy down at $11 or"
"5157880","5159240"," $12 here, right?"
"5160180","5166520"," But if I'm looking at a pound tear in a traditional chart, if I'm looking at a pound tear here,"
"5166520","5171160"," like PLTR, they're probably under standing."
"5171460","5177920"," So one hour chart on pound tear and we're only one day after getting a bear cross, right?"
"5178140","5178820"," Bear plane, right here."
"5179000","5179780"," We got a big bear plane. "
"5180460","5185120"," So if I was looking at this with just traditional charting and I'm looking at this bloodbath here,"
"5185120","5188440"," in my view, I would be like, yeah, you know what?"
"5188560","5191800"," We're probably going to get two or three down weeks in pound tear."
"5191800","5195780"," And if anything, this entire move from pound tear could be erased."
"5197080","5198460"," Me, I would be like that. "
"5198520","5199220"," I'd be like, you know what?"
"5199340","5201820"," We're probably going to get down here and erase this entire move."
"5202380","5205380"," We're going to $9.58 at minimum."
"5205720","5209680"," It's probably going to take one, two, three weeks with this major cross here. "
"5210080","5215520"," But we've seen these crosses on NASDAQ and spy resolve themselves to the upside."
"5216380","5220820"," So how do you tell if this actually resolves down here at 11 bucks?"
"5220820","5225680"," It's just 10 bucks, $11, excuse me, or even right where we are at 14, 22."
"5226600","5229120"," So right now it looks extremely bearish, right?"
"5229460","5231540"," It looks extremely like South fuck out of it. "
"5231820","5236780"," South 14, South, this is where the daily trigger is, and actually sell it down to 11 bucks."
"5237300","5241540"," Get it down into this weekly over the next few weeks, then we get the dip buy on pound tear."
"5242020","5243620"," But we've seen this reversal. "
"5244280","5249640"," My point to you here is that this year we have seen the reversals right where we are."
"5249640","5256040"," So for however extremely bearish this looks, how can we tell if this holds or not?"
"5256220","5256660"," How do you tell?"
"5257860","5259960"," So the answer to the question is this."
"5260180","5261240"," I'm going to give you the answer to this. "
"5261880","5264000"," So this looks extremely bearish here, right?"
"5264540","5269680"," We're right on the cost above the weekly or the daily and the monthly on PLTR, right?"
"5270680","5276340"," So you have 1387 is where we are, 1387, right down here."
"5276560","5277160"," This is the drop."
"5277920","5279000"," This is a big one. "
"5279140","5282660"," This is like to hold the line for the bulls on PLTR."
"5284020","5292200"," And your next one is likely at $11.23. Right down here."
"5292340","5294200"," We'll be submitting questions for the record. "
"5294480","5295100"," Thank you, Mr. Chair."
"5295340","5295680"," Thanks, Chair."
"5296040","5297760"," I would add that I don't think that. "
"5298560","5302980"," So how does a seller or a bull or a buyer have an edge?"
"5303560","5306300"," If you're a trader, right, you need to have an edge."
"5307040","5312220"," And just by looking at this chart, you already know and looking at NDX and spy, you already know"
"5312220","5317540"," that a lot of sellers did not have an edge."
"5317720","5319020"," They did not have an edge. "
"5319460","5324680"," And as we went up, when they were trying to put size into the market and they were like, hey,"
"5324780","5326140"," it's showing itself right now."
"5326600","5330200"," I'm going to slam down a hundred grand and we're going to go to the depths of hell."
"5330200","5333740"," And we have friends here, right, that show us their losses, right?"
"5333840","5334960"," I lost 600,000. "
"5335060","5336140"," I lost 100,000."
"5336380","5337900"," I lost 300,000."
"5338020","5341540"," My people are like, I got fucked up in that up-moving in the market. "
"5341980","5343540"," And I didn't have an edge."
"5344000","5349040"," And so when you need an edge in the marketplace, so right now, your edge is a seller."
"5349320","5351220"," You're like, hey, I've got confirmation here. "
"5351340","5353280"," I've got the fucking bear thing here."
"5353620","5356380"," I've got the fucking confirmation right here in Palantir."
"5356540","5357360"," We're going to the depths of hell. "
"5357760","5358480"," I'm not answering."
"5358700","5361860"," We don't go to the depths of hell down here, but they need a couple of things."
"5362040","5362900"," They need some edges, right?"
"5363080","5364040"," They need to know some things. "
"5364240","5364460"," They need it."
"5364560","5366920"," They know that they have to get underneath."
"5367820","5370520"," With the tool, they know they have to get underneath 1388. "
"5371120","5373220"," So if you're a seller, you need to see price."
"5373300","5375980"," You should be taking profit here, believe it or not, as a seller."
"5376280","5380720"," You take profit and you wait until you get the break under 1388. "
"5381620","5389020"," That's your next trade down to this $11.24. So there should be no trade for you as a bear"
"5389020","5391840"," on PLTR right now."
"5392040","5393200"," There's no trade for you."
"5393460","5400140"," It's actually under with confirmation to the downside to $11.24. Although this would seem like it"
"5400140","5401820"," is right where it is right now. "
"5402720","5403180"," It is not."
"5404140","5405860"," Now, this is the second part."
"5406120","5407500"," Is there a trade here for a bull?"
"5408420","5411060"," No, there is not a trade here for a bull. "
"5411060","5417260"," I want to bring Palantare back up for your PLTR back up for you as an example."
"5417900","5426220"," So what you're looking for as a bull for PLTR, the instruction to you would be PLTR needs to hold"
"5426220","5435940"," $13.88 and then you need to wait for the hourly trigger to come down and"
"5435940","5442100"," flatten the reason why businesses are reporting that labor supply and demand are getting into"
"5442100","5442300"," better."
"5442460","5448220"," You guys are going to get this tool here coming up here and soon, really fucking soon. "
"5449160","5451480"," So there's no trade for you here as a bull."
"5452000","5460800"," But if you see price, especially in health, hold all sorts of areas and pop up here like a relief"
"5460800","5463440"," rally on Thursday, Friday, right?"
"5463440","5465480"," And then begins to go higher."
"5466000","5467320"," You do have a trade in here. "
"5467600","5468760"," You do have a trade in here."
"5469480","5471560"," You see how you have a little bit of trade here."
"5471640","5472280"," You have a little bit of trade there. "
"5472400","5475640"," You have a second trade right in here to the upside."
"5476840","5481600"," And note here that the daily trend has not turned down yet."
"5482320","5483400"," You see it right here. "
"5483460","5484500"," It has not turned down."
"5484640","5486220"," Price has not broken below it."
"5486720","5489520"," And this could be another bear trap. "
"5490100","5495660"," So if you're a bear on Palantir, right, where we are, for you to have an edge in edge, we"
"5498960","5501680"," already know that a lot of you have lost a fuck ton of money."
"5503160","5504800"," Not having an edge, right?"
"5505900","5511340"," What are you looking for to take that trade to the downside as you're looking for the break of the"
"5511340","5513220"," daily, right?"
"5513220","5519740"," A confirmation of rejection here and the hourly to come down and help you to get down."
"5520380","5527960"," You need the help as a bear for the hourly to continue to the downside and break this daily. "
"5529120","5533880"," And then you enter your next leg down for a short on Palantir to 1,124."
"5534460","5538360"," You need this as a trader."
"5538840","5544280"," When you lose 600 grand or 300 grand or 100 grand and you want to put some size on a"
"5544280","5546320"," trade, you need to have that confirmation. "
"5546520","5550860"," Until you get that confirmation, you're going to get kind of fucked here, right?"
"5551180","5557340"," We know that as well as when we're below price on the hourly, the trend is down."
"5557900","5559700"," Currently it is bearish, right?"
"5559880","5561940"," Price is below the hourly right now."
"5562700","5565840"," But we are on this next level here, right?"
"5565840","5572820"," We're testing the daily and we're going to continue to test this daily until we have the velocity"
"5572820","5576180"," of the hourly trigger to push us through and down. "
"5576360","5582200"," But until that happens, these other moments where bears get fucked up and bulls too."
"5582720","5587880"," If this was flipped around right now, if this was flipped around, it would be the same thought"
"5587880","5592580"," process that as we come into that daily trigger, you'd be taking profit on your lungs and waiting"
"5592580","5596140"," until we break above and the hourly is going to come help you on the next like higher."
"5596900","5602660"," So just a key note here that's fascinating because if I'm looking at PLTR where it is right now,"
"5603020","5606860"," just traditional chart and I'd be like, yeah, that's a fucking instant short right where it stays"
"5606860","5607340"," right now. "
"5607660","5611020"," For me with this, I'm like, yeah, I'm going to wait and see what happens."
"5611720","5615560"," So if you had this tool, you'd be like, and you're like, I fucking hate PLTR."
"5616160","5617740"," You're still, you don't have a trade here. "
"5617740","5621060"," You actually literally don't have a trade to the downside right now on PLTR."
"5621060","5622220"," You got zero trades."
"5622580","5624840"," You need to wait for the break below in the rejection. "
"5625180","5627660"," You need to wait for the hourly to come help you out to the downside."
"5628560","5632080"," So like if you're in a time of trade, like timing of trade, you see me come online and I"
"5632080","5637680"," go buy Bitcoin right now or sell Tesla right now or buy Tesla."
"5638200","5643620"," That's because all this stuff has worked itself out and it's that moment where we go lower on a"
"5643620","5644100"," ticker. "
"5645240","5648840"," This is where one of the traps are for sellers."
"5648840","5653340"," And if this was in reverse, there'd be a trap for a buyer right where we are."
"5653920","5654700"," So Palantir. "
"5655320","5660820"," And specifically, the spy right now does look very bearish to me, right?"
"5661300","5664320"," Just on a baseline, it looks bearish to me."
"5664980","5669900"," I'm assuming there are sellers out there that are saying the same thing like we're extremely"
"5669900","5670820"," fucking bearish."
"5671120","5672100"," We're going to get a correction. "
"5673000","5674580"," NASDAQ, extremely bearish."
"5674700","5675320"," We're going to get a correction."
"5675880","5676260"," Google. "
"5676700","5677340"," We're going to get a correction."
"5678180","5684340"," So I'm just fascinated to watch how this plays out throughout the day, throughout today, tomorrow,"
"5684780","5685680"," that kind of stuff."
"5686440","5687900"," And this could be a trap, right?"
"5688320","5689120"," This could be a trap. "
"5689360","5692680"," So you're looking for, you know, you should be getting stopped out right now."
"5692740","5694340"," If you're still, so I believe it or not."
"5695420","5699540"," More assets of whatever character including them, they would have had more capital. "
"5699780","5700900"," We're going to go over this stuff."
"5701060","5701640"," We're going to do it."
"5702080","5703220"," You guys are going to get the tool. "
"5703360","5704040"," We're going to do it together."
"5704500","5705420"," You're going to get the white paper."
"5705420","5706820"," You're going to be like, I get it now. "
"5707160","5712160"," And you're going to be able to look at previous examples of this so that you have an edge against"
"5712160","5712840"," other people."
"5713500","5716340"," So when you're going to hear people that are bullish, you're going to be like, fuck no, I'm not"
"5716340","5716560"," bullish."
"5716840","5722460"," You guys saw me closing long positions in the market over weeks and weeks, right?"
"5722560","5726660"," I was like closing this, closing that, closing the IWM because of this and closing all these spec"
"5726660","5727520"," growth because of that. "
"5727800","5729300"," Now I'm just trading zero dates."
"5729560","5731100"," I don't resize the market anymore."
"5731740","5733100"," Now I just want to pull back, right?"
"5734020","5740080"," And so you guys are going to have access to this stuff so you can see where you trade right"
"5740080","5743200"," along with people like, yeah, I sure that shit right down to that yellow line. "
"5743300","5747040"," I took my money and ran and then I'm waiting for it to get below the yellow line so I"
"5747040","5748320"," can rein to the second one, right?"
"5748560","5749780"," So I can keep going down, down, down."
"5750120","5753580"," I didn't get caught in a reversal of the upside on PLTR or whatever it is."
"5753660","5756920"," To the type of banking run that we fucking baller dude. "
"5757060","5758560"," I'm telling, I want you guys to know something."
"5758760","5759700"," It's fucking baller."
"5761020","5766140"," And oftentimes I hate day trading with you guys right now because, hate day trading with you guys"
"5766140","5770600"," sometimes right now because if you guys have the tool out there with me, if you guys are working"
"5770600","5775140"," the tool with me, you'd know that we could just like come back and come in, come back, come in"
"5775140","5777000"," and not even have the fucking day trade. "
"5777380","5777740"," Well, we can."
"5778520","5781720"," There's ways for us to get alerts to actually day trade individual tickers."
"5782060","5783860"," We can run it right now if you want. "
"5785060","5786400"," That's what was going on."
"5786540","5787880"," I'll run it right now for you in the background."
"5789860","5791180"," Hold on a second here. "
"5791660","5794840"," I'm supposed to be getting worked out in the background right now and I'm fucking not getting it"
"5794840","5795040"," done."
"5795520","5796480"," Hold on a second here."
"5798480","5801780"," You have to retain earnings or raise it or get some new equity. "
"5802220","5804640"," You guys want a small list of shit to be looking at right now?"
"5805300","5807700"," Take a peek at a PCOR PCOR."
"5808460","5810460"," Take a look at GTLB GitLab."
"5810840","5814720"," Take a look at ALGM, Allegro Microsystems. "
"5815140","5816800"," Take a look at BRZE right now."
"5816800","5818220"," Take a look at Unity, U."
"5818700","5819940"," Take a look at IoT."
"5820720","5822140"," That's Sam Saranq. "
"5822480","5823600"," Look at CRDO."
"5823980","5825780"," That's Credo technology and look at Sound."
"5826320","5831240"," SU and if you're looking for something to day trade right now, those are the ones I'm going to give"
"5831240","5831680"," you for today. "
"5834460","5835260"," PCOR GTLB."
"5835960","5836900"," We'll sum off one more time."
"5837040","5837860"," Get your pens and paper ready. "
"5839940","5843420"," PCOR GTLB ALGM BRZE."
"5843420","5848240"," You, IoT, CRDO, S-O-U-N."
"5848420","5852140"," Some flight of deposits away from the larger banks. "
"5852420","5854040"," I really worry about this."
"5854120","5859440"," This fascinates me because when we're at these pivots, not this daily pivot, but we're at these"
"5859440","5860660"," market moments."
"5862320","5869000"," Oftentimes this is where people lose big money, big money. "
"5869000","5875200"," Like, this is the bottom or this is the top or this is the next leg down."
"5875880","5881900"," This is where I, in fact, most of my largest losses, like big ones, like six figure losses."
"5882500","5883600"," Moments like this. "
"5885780","5887180"," Always moments like this."
"5888520","5891740"," Right where we are, like, everything's saying something."
"5892800","5895440"," And it goes the other way and you go, what the fuck happened?"
"5895440","5901000"," And you still believe in your trade and then you just, like, grind six figures down to, like,"
"5901360","5903520"," fucking zero because it was like, fuck this. "
"5904080","5904640"," I'm right."
"5904860","5905140"," They're wrong."
"5905280","5906140"," It's going to roll. "
"5906340","5906860"," It's going to fail."
"5907000","5907540"," It's going to this."
"5908040","5910280"," You can apply this to buyer or seller. "
"5910600","5911200"," It doesn't matter."
"5911920","5913120"," Like, you could be a bull bear."
"5913320","5914300"," I don't care what you are. "
"5915940","5916920"," It's just fascinating."
"5917440","5918520"," Right where we are right now."
"5918680","5920380"," I spent, like, an hour on the phone. "
"5920380","5926900"," I actually entered a meeting last night talking to Winky about this because I'm like, this doesn't"
"5926900","5927360"," happen often."
"5928320","5933080"," And right now is one of those moments I got to call you because we've been discussing this for a"
"5933080","5936900"," long time and these are one of those moments where you're going to find out."
"5937640","5938660"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman. "
"5939480","5942460"," So we want to look at it sincerely."
"5942760","5943780"," Thank you for being here today."
"5944800","5950600"," And first and foremost, I believe that the Fed must make sure that we have an economy that truly"
"5950600","5953500"," works for working families, I suspect you would agree. "
"5954460","5960980"," And the reality is that the tool of cooling the economy with interest hike hikes can push people"
"5960980","5961580"," out of jobs."
"5962780","5964900"," We want to drive down inflation, of course."
"5965120","5965600"," That makes sense. "
"5966280","5970020"," But we don't want to hurt working people to suffer."
"5971180","5974600"," You know, how do you kind of square that together because it's quite a paradox?"
"5976160","5979940"," So it's working people who are the most hurt by inflation."
"5980480","5981460"," It is a bit of a paradox. "
"5982120","5982620"," I would agree."
"5983920","5985300"," If you're living on..."
"5985300","5986000"," Well, quite the paradox."
"5986420","5986520"," Exactly. "
"5986840","5986980"," You're absolutely right."
"5987740","5987760"," No."
"5988000","5993520"," So if you're living on a fixed income and you're spending every dollar on necessities of life,"
"5993700","5998820"," transportation, fuel, food, clothing, and inflation goes up. "
"5999060","5999720"," You're in trouble right away."
"5999940","6001180"," You don't have a safety net."
"6001380","6003800"," You're not a middle class or a wealthier person. "
"6003800","6007240"," So it is for those people that we need to get inflation under control."
"6007580","6012820"," It is also the case, though, that the way the tool that we have, and we are the organization that's"
"6012820","6018100"," charged with price stability, is to cool off demand so that demand and supply get into better"
"6018100","6019920"," alignment over time."
"6020240","6026980"," And we, of course, would love to do that in the current situation with as little effect on the"
"6026980","6028320"," labor market as we can. "
"6028740","6033380"," And there's much cooling that can take off in the labor market that doesn't involve higher"
"6033380","6033540"," unemployment."
"6034220","6039800"," However, I can't guarantee that restoring price stability wouldn't have some implications of a"
"6039800","6040160"," higher unemployment."
"6040740","6047640"," But you have to think that restoring price stability will pay benefits to everybody, especially low"
"6047640","6049240"," and moderate income people, for decades. "
"6050520","6050660"," Yeah."
"6051320","6051920"," Thank you."
"6052100","6052980"," No, and I agree. "
"6053220","6056740"," It's just such a paradox because you have a dual mandate."
"6057760","6060580"," And now we're going to kind of change the gears."
"6060580","6064400"," There's clear that inflation over the last years have been many causes. "
"6065140","6068040"," It includes rampant corporate price gouging and monopolies."
"6068580","6073700"," While Americans have gotten ripped off, executives and shareholders have raked in record profits,"
"6074220","6074960"," it's deeply immoral."
"6075940","6083280"," I understand that it's not the policing price gouging and not in the Fred's directory, but you"
"6083280","6088590"," might look at smart ways to fight inflation. "
"6088590","6095010"," Is it fair to say that big businesses have been jacking up their prices and way more than their"
"6095010","6095730"," costs have increased?"
"6096430","6097330"," Is that accurate?"
"6097730","6098210"," So I think..."
"6098210","6101910"," Just a note here where they're talking about what Jerome is talking about, or what a Federman is"
"6101910","6109190"," talking about right here is directly related to PCE tomorrow or Friday, excuse me, Friday."
"6109530","6113070"," Rates were very low, so demand was just very, very high."
"6113630","6114490"," And we couldn't make cars. "
"6114490","6119390"," Literally, production of cars went down because there weren't enough semiconductors."
"6119490","6123330"," I mean, I personally didn't realize that you needed a lot of semiconductors in a car, but now"
"6123330","6124070"," everybody knows that."
"6124370","6127290"," So what happened was, how do you decide who gets the car?"
"6127470","6128330"," You had dual mandate. "
"6129090","6135390"," Well, because when there's a lot of supply and restricted supply, a lot of demand and restricted"
"6135390","6137250"," supply, you get higher prices."
"6137730","6142630"," As the economy returns to normal function and we have more semiconductors now..."
"6142630","6143530"," Is that John Federman?"
"6143790","6145690"," He actually looks healthier."
"6146230","6147470"," Do you think he had a heart attack or something?"
"6147630","6147990"," He looks good. "
"6148350","6151430"," Well, assuming the doctor was like, fuck you, you're not eating pizza and bagels anymore."
"6151730","6153250"," It's just the way the economy is working."
"6154450","6159170"," So is it fair to say that you don't believe that price gouging wasn't a factor?"
"6161170","6167090"," So I think that the collision between very strong demand and limited supply was a big factor,"
"6167090","6168910"," particularly as it relates to goods inflation. "
"6169950","6171650"," It's not much ice right now."
"6171650","6174870"," It's above the five minutes, 27 EMA."
"6175010","6177430"," It's bullish for about three quarters of inflation. "
"6178230","6178730"," Okay."
"6179190","6179650"," All right."
"6179710","6179950"," Thank you. "
"6180510","6182270"," Seating the time back to the Chairman."
"6182590","6183350"," Thank you, Senator Federman."
"6183350","6184810"," Senator Danes, I'm on Tana's record. "
"6186470","6187690"," Chairman, thank you."
"6188810","6191090"," It's about a bit heavy here this morning here."
"6191890","6196690"," In that Montana, as well as the Mountain West, inflation remains above 5%. "
"6196690","6203370"," In fact, we're higher than any other region in the nation, whether it's gas stations, grocery"
"6203370","6209650"," stores, increasing prices, and its real life impacts remain truly a top of mind and daily issue for"
"6209650","6210330"," Montanans."
"6211290","6218930"," With inflation remaining stubbornly high, I can't help but reflect on the warning signs that were"
"6218930","6226690"," ignored by my colleagues across the aisle while they raced to push through trillions of dollars in"
"6226690","6230570"," partisan spending disguised as COVID relief."
"6231970","6236090"," And now the American people are bearing the brunt of this reckless spending. "
"6236810","6243390"," In fact, for the average American, unless you've received in nearly 16% pay raise over the past two"
"6243390","6246030"," years, you've effectively received a pay cut."
"6247350","6254270"," Chair Powell, I urge you and the Fed to remain vigilant and steadfast in your effort to remain in"
"6254270","6256770"," inflation for the sake of all Americans."
"6258510","6263370"," Unfortunately, record high inflation is not the only crisis the Fed is having to navigate. "
"6264410","6270690"," While bank regulators were more focused on climate change than actually regulating the banks under"
"6270690","6276810"," their supervision, several coastal banks collapsed and caused panic across the banking sector."
"6277550","6283370"," Before the dust even settled, several of my colleagues across the aisle immediately began calling"
"6283370","6289530"," for increased regulations and greater capital requirements for banks with little appreciation for"
"6289530","6295750"," the negative impacts these changes would have on small and mid-sized banks across the country."
"6296510","6302150"," I've heard from community banks across Montana who are justifiably concerned that they will be"
"6302150","6308970"," wrongfully punished for the actions of a few poorly regulated and poorly managed banks. "
"6310210","6314970"," You mentioned several times your testimony yesterday and again here today that the U.S. banks"
"6314970","6317390"," remain strong and well capitalized."
"6319560","6327420"," Chair Powell, if banks are so well capitalized, why the urgency now to increase capital"
"6327420","6333000"," requirements that would really prevent another Silicon Valley bank?"
"6334680","6340840"," Well, let me say first that I think that we don't have a final proposal to talk about yet when"
"6340840","6348160"," we do we'll be able to talk much more specifically about it, but for community banks and banks, any"
"6348160","6353300"," banks under $100 billion, I don't think they're going to be part of this proposal."
"6353300","6358200"," So we're really talking about principally the very largest banks, the G-SIBs, and to a lesser"
"6358200","6364000"," extent the banks, the regionals, and then the banks between $100 and $250. "
"6364920","6365920"," And yes, the right question."
"6366240","6371360"," We, you know, the question is more capital the answer and we'll be addressing that."
"6371440","6375240"," We'll be making a proposal, we'll be soliciting public comment on that. "
"6376040","6378020"," I'm well aware that there's a trade-off here."
"6378020","6384160"," More capital means more stable banks, it means stronger banks, but there's also a trade-off there."
"6384380","6387540"," And with capital, you've got to make a judgment about where you draw that line. "
"6387800","6393980"," Yeah, and to that point, increasing the capital requirements could in turn decrease lending."
"6395080","6402260"," Will the impact this have on small businesses who may not be able to get a loan be taken to"
"6402260","6404340"," account before you finalize a proposal?"
"6405420","6411060"," Yes, I mean, the thing is stronger capital means banks will be able to continue the land during"
"6411060","6412380"," difficult times too, right?"
"6412480","6415660"," So that's why we do it, is for those stressful times."
"6415920","6421480"," But it is a judgment call and a lot of, there's a lot of science and arithmetic that goes into"
"6421480","6427780"," it, but ultimately deciding how high to go is a challenging question. "
"6428180","6433760"," So we're going to be making a proposal and I'll personally be listening carefully to the comments."
"6434480","6443820"," You alluded to focus more on the G-SIBs and trying to spare the smaller banks, perhaps, from the"
"6443820","6444140"," impact."
"6445720","6450920"," And I realized a proposal was still being developed, is not finally baked yet. "
"6451700","6460300"," But are you prepared to commit to sparing the smaller community banks from changes that might"
"6460300","6461600"," propose on capital requirements?"
"6462900","6469300"," So let me say my understanding is that the proposal doesn't affect banks under 100 billion and I"
"6469300","6472580"," would have serious questions as to why it would, particularly most communities."
"6472740","6478760"," Just take a note that we are also seeing a reversal on NASDAQ, same similar reversal right now."
"6478840","6481880"," Price is trying to break above $14,961. "
"6482100","6482580"," Thank you."
"6482880","6487320"," Keep an eye on that NDX 50-minute bear cross is recovering."
"6487320","6492380"," I appreciate the wait and see approach the FMOC took at its most recent. "
"6492380","6496040"," Vicks dying, Vicks forming a bear plane on it."
"6497140","6499720"," Tesla with a massive bull cross."
"6500420","6502440"," It's tight as we've ever seen. "
"6502840","6507480"," It was noted, however, that the committee is poised to continue raising rates later this year."
"6507640","6508440"," My final question."
"6509020","6514900"," I don't know if I'm looking for a double bottom here for the rest of the year and speak to"
"6514900","6515240"," your content. "
"6515240","6515940"," Get ready, man."
"6516140","6516860"," It's there again."
"6517120","6517600"," One more time. "
"6517780","6519920"," They're looking to take another rip faces off here."
"6521380","6521860"," Yes."
"6522140","6529820"," So I think if you look at the committee's forecasts in minor, very similar, we expect modest growth"
"6529820","6536120"," going forward, growth in the, you know, below the sort of longer run growth rate of the United"
"6536120","6539700"," States economy, which is around 2% or a little less, growth lower than that. "
"6539700","6544660"," And we expect the labor market to continue to gradually cool off."
"6545400","6550260"," And with that, there's an expectation that inflation will continue to move down later this year."
"6550600","6556520"," And if things happen that are sort of broadly in keeping with that, the strong majority of the"
"6556520","6562700"," committee believes it will be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate again once or twice by"
"6562700","6563300"," the end of the year. "
"6563500","6566520"," Strong majority came down on twice between now and the end of the year."
"6566520","6570420"," So I think the data will tell us what to do."
"6570780","6575600"," I think the point of our meeting, the last meeting was really to moderate the pace of our decision "
"6575600","6579220","-making on this because, you know, it was very important to move quickly last year. "
"6579220","6579620"," And we did."
"6579920","6583860"," It's not so important now because we've come so far and we're relatively close."
"6583860","6589740"," We think to where we need to get, but we will, I mean, people should believe and broadly speaking"
"6589740","6594300"," the data show that they do believe that we will do what it takes to get inflation down to 2 "
"6594300","6595180","% over time. "
"6595180","6597720"," Thank you, Senator Agrides, from Tennessee's recognized."
"6598340","6601840"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Chairman Powell, good to see you again."
"6602640","6608480"," I'd like to start with something that has troubled me since our hearing yesterday regarding the"
"6608480","6612040"," Basel 3 in-game proposal that's coming forward by Vice Chair Barr. "
"6613760","6616680"," The proposal is going to have far-reaching ramifications, I think."
"6617160","6622980"," It's rumored to have over 1,000 pages in it, yet when I asked Governor Cook about the proposal"
"6623880","6626420"," yesterday, she told me she hadn't seen it, has not reviewed it."
"6627200","6631820"," And my understanding is that the agencies, including the Fed, are due to vote on this on the 18th"
"6631820","6632240"," of July. "
"6633340","6637540"," And given the fact that I think Senator Warner described it happily yesterday, the potential for a"
"6637540","6643680"," perfect storm here, if the rumors that we're hearing about capital requirement increases that may"
"6643680","6650300"," be proposed are true, this may come at a time, banks may be preparing for a capital increase at a"
"6650300","6654220"," time when we absolutely need banks to be lending, not constraining lending by raising capital"
"6654220","6654820"," requirements."
"6655580","6660300"," So I think there are numerous analyses, the impacts on the small business community, on the banking"
"6660300","6661720"," system need to be taken to account."
"6662660","6668180"," And I'm very concerned, particularly in light of Governor Cook's response that she had not reviewed"
"6668180","6673420"," it, hasn't seen it, and didn't seem to have any perspective on it at this point in time. "
"6673580","6679680"," It's a very short window to undertake a decision on something as complex as we may be talking about"
"6679680","6681500"," with over 1,000 pages in this report."
"6681500","6687500"," So my question of view is how will this process be managed at the Fed in terms of the decision"
"6687500","6689540"," making and the analyses that need to take place?"
"6690140","6694680"," So I'll make sure that governors have enough time to carefully evaluate this."
"6694900","6702320"," So the staff has been briefing governors for the past few weeks about what, but the proposal is"
"6702320","6707020"," still evolving though, you're still, I mean, I'm hearing even as recently as this morning things"
"6707020","6710800"," are moving still, so it's not possible when you say we haven't seen it. "
"6710800","6712420"," We have not seen a final proposal."
"6712780","6718420"," There isn't something to send to the committee, and I think you can be briefed on the current state"
"6718420","6720680"," of where things are, and I have been in detail."
"6721060","6727740"," But ultimately, when you sit down to read this large document, I'm going to wait for the final"
"6727740","6733920"," version to really do that, but you're right to point to the need for time to evaluate it. "
"6733960","6737980"," Governor Cook's response to me is she deflected yesterday, just left me with a great concern."
"6737980","6738820"," So I appreciate it."
"6738820","6741900"," I just see no need to rush here given the significance of what's happening. "
"6741900","6747620"," And frankly, the other concerns you and I have discussed in terms of where we are today, I think it"
"6747620","6749640"," warrants every, you know, a very deep consideration."
"6750500","6755100"," I'd like to turn to another item that you and I have also discussed in the past, Mr. Chairman, and"
"6755100","6756300"," that has to do with bank mergers."
"6757580","6763580"," And if you think about a potential bank that's in distress, all things being equal, will we be"
"6763580","6768740"," better off for that bank, that distress bank, to undertake a merger or acquisition, or would we be"
"6768740","6770940"," better off to let it enter into receivership?"
"6771500","6774200"," The former, certainly, I agree with you. "
"6774760","6780600"," Yet we also, in the case of First Republic Bank, it was like a slow-moving train, stock bicyclaps,"
"6780900","6785520"," they were actually, in my understanding, 11 different financial institutions that put forward"
"6785520","6789580"," proposals that would have, you know, been a rescue package for the bank."
"6789580","6794960"," And I get none where, none went far enough to achieve an actual merger or an acquisition in that"
"6794960","6795180"," place."
"6795280","6796780"," In fact, they let it go into receivership. "
"6798060","6804020"," And, you know, my concern is that this administration has created such a negative environment for"
"6804020","6807200"," consolidations, that it's a real issue."
"6807840","6812480"," My question of view is, do you think the current state we are, should we allow more banks to merge,"
"6812480","6815020"," especially given the stress that we're seeing in the system?"
"6815020","6823200"," So I think there was every chance given for, and much hope bestowed on the idea of having that bank"
"6823200","6828020"," sold before it went into receivership, it just, they couldn't, they couldn't make it happen."
"6828340","6829080"," And that's unfortunate. "
"6829580","6832040"," Everyone would have loved to see that outcome rather than a receivership."
"6832200","6833440"," No one wanted that to be the case."
"6833720","6834980"," I'm certainly in the camp as well. "
"6836920","6844120"," My view is that there's an environment right now of uncertainty, as the banking community looks at"
"6844120","6852800"," mergers and acquisitions in the guidance that the White House has given about, very negative in"
"6852800","6856040"," terms of mergers and acquisitions against good accounts and consolidations."
"6856440","6861580"," I think that institutions are very reticent to move forward, and that's why I've introduced the"
"6861580","6866680"," Depositor Protection Act, which among its many provisions, it's going to provide a green light to"
"6866680","6871440"," well-capitalized, well-rated banks to merge with institutions that are under distress without"
"6871440","6872900"," having regulatory interference."
"6874020","6878200"," And so as the committee moves forward, I hope that we're going to have opportunity to work on this"
"6878200","6878620"," legislation. "
"6878880","6883920"," I hope we can remove needless regulatory hurdles, and I hope we can actually encourage mergers and"
"6883920","6885380"," acquisitions that will protect taxpayers."
"6887020","6893200"," One final point I'd like to raise with you, Mr. Chair, it's something that you identified nearly a"
"6893200","6893820"," decade ago."
"6894300","6898600"," At that point in time, the Fed created a reverse-reversed-reversed-reversed facility that was"
"6898600","6902040"," intended to be a tool that would put a floor on interest rates. "
"6902700","6907080"," The facility was targeted at investment vehicles like money market funds, which actually play a"
"6907080","6908700"," significant role in the short-term funding markets."
"6909240","6913840"," At that time, you joined others in the board in expressing concern about the possible-ended"
"6913840","6917320"," consequences of this facility, particularly in times of market stress."
"6918080","6922400"," That's where this facility could actually exacerbate the so-called flight to safety. "
"6923220","6928340"," Since that time, this facility has grown to over $2 trillion worth of overnight deposits at the"
"6928340","6928560"," Fed."
"6929520","6934720"," So I'd love for you to walk us through, if you might, the potential risks that this facility might"
"6934720","6940520"," pose and take us through how it relates to basically pulling deposits out of the banking system at"
"6940520","6942200"," a time when we like to retain those deposits."
"6942800","6947140"," So the reverse-reversed-reversed facility really has an increased effect. "
"6947260","6952060"," It's shrunk in size since the events of March, so it's really not on net accounting for the decline"
"6952060","6953000"," in deposits."
"6953000","6958160"," It's really what's happening there is that market rates are higher than deposit rates and"
"6958160","6960020"," depositors are moving their mind."
"6960220","6961620"," This happens in every cycle. "
"6962420","6965560"," I think the- I would interrupt for just a moment, please, Mr. Chairman."
"6965740","6969960"," So are my numbers incorrect that we now have $2 trillion that are parked in this facility by money"
"6969960","6970240"," market?"
"6970440","6973420"," We had $2.5 trillion before March, so it's come down in size."
"6973680","6979740"," In fact, now that Treasury is refilling the debt ceiling is solved and they're refilling the"
"6979740","6985360"," Treasury general account, the reverse-reversed facility has been declining, and that's what we"
"6985360","6988340"," would have hoped to see rather than taking reserves out of the system. "
"6988540","6989460"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"6989920","6992360"," Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"6995200","7002720"," The challenge of coming a bit late, you kind of ask my question, but Chairman, great to see you"
"7002720","7002940"," again. "
"7004180","7009300"," I'm going to at least ask a variation on my- of the same question I think a number of"
"7009300","7014600"," members have asked, and, you know, I know a lot of us are- are sometimes get the advantage of"
"7014600","7017900"," being Monday morning quarterbacks on how you navigate through monetary policy."
"7018220","7020860"," I think you've generally done a pretty good job."
"7021040","7022680"," I'm very grateful that you're on a pause. "
"7022920","7029020"," I hope that pause as the data comes through continues, but we definitely have some stresses with"
"7029020","7030060"," that monetary policy."
"7032420","7036480"," Secondly, you know, you were doing what, again, I think people on both sides of the aisle have"
"7036480","7039700"," called for in terms of quantitative tightening."
"7041120","7049560"," Again, that doesn't have the immediate effect that monetary policy has. "
"7050400","7054760"," But as we've discussed, and I think Senator Haggard you raised, we also have, you know, the"
"7054760","7062100"," appropriate review that Vice Chair Barr, Barr for Supervision is doing on capital standards."
"7062980","7068000"," And I think Senator Haggard and my staff told me even used the term I was going to use a"
"7068000","7070740"," perfect storm of these three all coming together."
"7071000","7074580"," I borrowed your term from yesterday, and it will properly- properly acknowledge that Senator"
"7074580","7074840"," Haggard. "
"7074860","7077240"," I'll call it a very stressful situation."
"7078300","7083440"," And I understand, I think you pointed out that my friend from Tennessee, you know, the capital"
"7083440","7090540"," requirements will phase in, but, you know, you could have all three of these events come together."
"7090540","7096500"," I think you've addressed this already, but I just want to add my voice to that concern. "
"7097800","7104380"," Safety and soundness, you've got a lot of jobs, safety and soundness, inflation control, and full"
"7104380","7110060"," employment, full employment piece could be affected by this potential perfect storm."
"7110660","7115240"," And again, I hope all of your colleagues, I raised this with the other members of the nominees for"
"7115240","7121200"," the Fed yesterday, and I hope you will, and again, I think you've been asked and how you've asked"
"7121200","7121500"," here."
"7122040","7125900"," I don't know if you've got anything else you want to add to what you've already responded to that. "
"7126680","7131060"," I'll just say, you're right, we're thinking very much about that."
"7131500","7136000"," Fortunately, it's been orderly, you know, the shrinkage of the balance sheet has been quite"
"7136000","7136240"," orderly."
"7136580","7141660"," There's still a very, very high level of cash reserves in the system, and we don't think they'll be"
"7141660","7142780"," scarce anytime soon. "
"7143700","7148360"," We think the refilling of the Treasury General account, that was, people have been focused on that"
"7148360","7151520"," for a couple of months, so far early days, that seems to be going well."
"7151860","7152880"," We're watching it very carefully."
"7153180","7158900"," But again, and it's easy to sometimes sit up here and attack rather than manage all three of these,"
"7159020","7166400"," but there could be this moment in time where these factors all come together that could have a"
"7166400","7168140"," really negative effect on the economy. "
"7168880","7172400"," Let me move to, I think something that's not been raised."
"7173180","7175680"," I have huge concerns."
"7177480","7183280"," We've all litigated back and forth causation on SGB, but one of the things that happened when you"
"7183280","7188520"," get, you know, 40 plus billion dollars coming out of an institution in six hours driven by an"
"7188520","7195060"," internet-based run, that is, you know, I don't know what regulatory framework prevents that. "
"7195240","7201740"," And while I was glad that the SEC Chair Gensler put out a commentary that's saying, you know, we do"
"7201740","7207440"," need to take a look more transparency on short-selling, we've found in past short-selling bars"
"7207440","7209220"," themselves don't prevent some of this."
"7210280","7217840"," One of the things that a New York Fed official mentioned is how do we get rid of the stigma"
"7218980","7226390"," of a bank going, you know, to the window?"
"7226390","7233770"," I mean, the thing is, rather than Fed being lender always of last resort, you know, if we have that"
"7233770","7239570"," liquidity window, what's available, banks are reluctant to use it, but in an era where people can"
"7239570","7245610"," move capital so quickly, having that liquidity tool available and not taking a huge amount of hits"
"7245610","7252330"," for using it would seem to me to be something that could at least take on this question of these"
"7252330","7257290"," internet-driven runs, which so far I've not heard from anybody on either side of the aisle, a"
"7257290","7262570"," really good suggestion, including, I've thrown out a lot of suggestions that, frankly, after a"
"7262570","7267890"," prime reflection, I'm not sure, make that much sense, but this liquidity tool of using the window,"
"7268110","7273010"," the Fed discount window, you know, is a way to think about getting rid of the stigma, and maybe"
"7273010","7275370"," moving as policymakers ought to make that point as well."
"7275630","7276370"," But should you address that?"
"7276430","7280650"," Well, it's, you know, it's critically important that people be able to use and willing to use the"
"7280650","7286690"," discount window and also the bank term funding facility, other facilities that we set up, and that"
"7286690","7290270"," they aren't marked down by the markets for doing that. "
"7290470","7290830"," And so..."
"7290830","7291310"," And the..."
"7291310","7292850"," Or marked down by the regulators."
"7293670","7294430"," Are they examiners?"
"7295010","7295190"," Yeah."
"7296130","7300450"," But the concern is that markets will see this, and, you know, so I would say the first thing is"
"7300450","7306530"," do no harm, and that is, you know, we, the Dodd-Frank provided disclosure of names and things like"
"7306530","7308650"," that at a quicker pace. "
"7308910","7311970"," That's one of the reasons banks don't want to do this, is they know their names come in."
"7312070","7314130"," Just don't..."
"7314130","7319370"," Whenever you look at changing that disclosure around use of these facilities or that, you should be"
"7319370","7321550"," really considered that you're going to make the stigma worse."
"7322030","7327090"," I actually think it's good that banks have been willing to use the discount window and the new"
"7327090","7331970"," facility during this crisis, and it's almost like the stigma is a little bit less than it was. "
"7332370","7333450"," I want to thank that anyway."
"7334310","7340870"," Thanks, Senator Cortez Masto, Nevada's next two Republicans in a row I called on."
"7340870","7343570"," So, Senator Britt, you will be after Senator Cortez Masto, Nevada. "
"7344110","7345190"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"7345830","7347330"," Chairman Powell, it's great to see you again."
"7347570","7347970"," Thank you. "
"7348710","7350710"," I'm very glad that yesterday."
"7351630","7353490"," I think Senator Warner mentioned this."
"7353610","7359190"," We had hearings for nominees to the Federal Reserve, and one of the nominees is the first Hispanic"
"7359190","7366030"," to sit on the Federal Reserve, Dr. Adriana Coogler, who has extensive experience economically as"
"7366030","7368470"," well as including, congressionally confirmed positions. "
"7368470","7372170"," I'm looking forward to supporting her confirmation as well."
"7372630","7380610"," Let me talk to you a little bit about tougher lending standards that might be affecting inflation"
"7382030","7383530"," as interest rates increase."
"7384170","7389450"," Yesterday, Rafael Bostik, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, published a blog post"
"7389450","7395390"," noting that the tightening bank lending standards we see are directly due to the Federal Reserve's"
"7395390","7396930"," higher interest rates. "
"7397510","7401730"," Do you think that the credit tightening we see from regional banks is acting as an effective"
"7401730","7405310"," substitute to an additional interest rate hike?"
"7406130","7407210"," It may be."
"7407430","7408250"," We've been looking for that."
"7408350","7413190"," We actually don't see a lot of evidence of additional tightening on top of what we have already"
"7413190","7416090"," been seeing yet, but we're keeping our eyes out for that. "
"7416350","7422830"," And so then what are some risks if the FOMC continues to raise interest rates, despite seeing the"
"7422830","7428050"," impact of these rate increases already resulting in more credit tightening and higher housing"
"7428050","7428410"," costs?"
"7428610","7429690"," And we talked a little bit about this."
"7430490","7438070"," So the risk is that we, the reason we've slowed down, really since last December, we slowed from 75"
"7438070","7442310"," to 50 basis points per meeting to 25 at every meeting."
"7442790","7448870"," And now as we reach, as we get closer and closer to what we believe will be, it's uncertain, but"
"7448870","7451630"," we think our destinations, we've slowed down a little further. "
"7451630","7455470"," So we're trying to avoid the mistake of going too far."
"7456810","7457770"," That's all it is."
"7457910","7464450"," It's, as you can see, overwhelmingly people on the committee do believe that it will be appropriate"
"7464450","7466530"," to raise hikes one or two additional times. "
"7466730","7471070"," A strong majority believes two times this year if the economy performs as expected."
"7471530","7471990"," Thank you."
"7472150","7478010"," And so let's, I'm going to jump to employment, and this is something I talked about yesterday as"
"7478010","7481790"," well, because Nevada has this sort of workforce paradox. "
"7482970","7489750"," The most recent data shows that in Nevada, with both the biggest increase in draw growth and the"
"7489750","7499650"," highest unemployment rate, I want to get your thoughts on moving forward as we address this"
"7499650","7501110"," concern, this paradox."
"7502170","7503410"," Let me just give you an example."
"7503570","7508550"," Nevada has a largest percent increase in employment, which was 4.2%. We also had the highest"
"7508550","7515090"," unemployment rate in the nation in April at 5.4%, two points above the national rate. "
"7515850","7521650"," As you consider the Federal Reserve's mandate to keep unemployment levels low, how do you consider"
"7521650","7523290"," states like Nevada where there is that paradox?"
"7524210","7527170"," So we only have the one federal funds rate we really can't."
"7527250","7532110"," We have to look at the national level, although we do, we're well aware of different labor markets"
"7532110","7536430"," and also interesting characteristics in Nevada."
"7536890","7541450"," Well, and we've talked about this because the labor market particularly in the service industry has"
"7541450","7546190"," been a drag, and we've seen that in Nevada, and you and I have talked about this as well. "
"7546390","7552790"," Is that something you consider as you look at the numbers, particularly in the service industry,"
"7552830","7553790"," and what are you seeing?"
"7554690","7559870"," So we're seeing in the service industry is really where we still see labor shortage."
"7559870","7564550"," You still have a very high level of number of job openings compared to the number of unemployed"
"7564550","7564950"," people."
"7565130","7570710"," And I think even in Nevada, you've got a job openings ratio to unemployed of 1.4 or something like"
"7570710","7570910"," that. "
"7571110","7576370"," That was unheard of before this period of time, and that just means there's still tremendous"
"7576370","7581950"," demand, and of course in Nevada, it would largely be in, you know, travel and entertainment sector."
"7582390","7583450"," I would into it."
"7583610","7585550"," And then talk about the housing data, if you would. "
"7585870","7589750"," It's another conversation we had and how much of a drag that is on the economy as well and what"
"7589750","7590150"," you're saying."
"7590670","7598990"," So, you know, housing is very interest sensitive spending, you know, mortgage rates are very"
"7598990","7605010"," sensitive to our policies and housing construction and housing sales and things like that are very"
"7605010","7606290"," sensitive to mortgage rates."
"7606610","7613290"," So you saw housing activity move down pretty significantly when we started raising rates. "
"7613510","7615130"," You've actually seen it kind of hit a bottom now."
"7615130","7620550"," We actually met with some, with a housing group, manufacturers, housing builders yesterday, and"
"7620550","7622570"," they say, business is pretty good."
"7622690","7627270"," It's largely new entrants though, people, many people have low rate mortgages that they're not"
"7627270","7633190"," eager to get out of, and so the sort of strength you see now is new buyers coming into the"
"7633190","7633470"," market. "
"7633670","7641110"," So the market seems to be improving, but again, it's the most interest sensitive spending or among"
"7641110","7641870"," the most interest sense."
"7641950","7643630"," So it's going to be affected when we tighten policy."
"7643630","7644030"," Okay. "
"7644850","7645330"," Thank you."
"7645670","7646570"," Appreciate you being there."
"7647270","7648910"," Senator Brett of Alabama was recognized. "
"7649470","7650410"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"7651290","7655210"," I want to start by acknowledging the strength of the U.S. banking sector."
"7655930","7661610"," In recent events that unfolded related to SVB, signature and first republic, it highlighted the"
"7661610","7668050"," significant consequences that could occur when bank execs prioritize profits over risk management. "
"7668050","7672050"," And also when banking guys watching this, right?"
"7673850","7678310"," Regulators left numerous red flags unaddressed, which I see it."
"7678430","7679170"," You guys see it."
"7679710","7682470"," These banks to continue for as long as they did. "
"7683090","7684150"," Let's be clear."
"7684750","7688990"," This in action played a significant role in these banks ultimate demise."
"7689990","7695550"," However, the missed management and excessive risk taking that occurred within these institutions"
"7695970","7700230"," are not representative of the broader banking sector. "
"7701130","7702750"," In fact, I think it's quite contrary."
"7703450","7710030"," Banks across the board have proven to be resilient, well capitalized and a source of strength in"
"7710030","7710770"," the global economy."
"7711650","7721010"," In fact, I think you see that the U.S. comprised of banks of all sizes is the world's most"
"7721010","7722830"," dynamic banking system. "
"7723690","7730050"," I'm concerned, though, with impending actions of the Federal Reserve that that in itself will be"
"7730050","7730670"," jeopardized."
"7733140","7741360"," If you look, community banks, for instance, have served our individuals in our small and rural"
"7741360","7748240"," communities across not only my great state of Alabama, but across our entire country in ways that"
"7748240","7754520"," have allowed individuals and small businesses to actually be able to achieve the American dream and"
"7754520","7755080"," to thrive."
"7755940","7761060"," However, over the past decade, we've seen a significant decline in the number of community of banks"
"7761060","7762300"," serving Americans. "
"7763120","7771060"," The U.S. has lost 71% of total banks in the last four decades, and unfortunately, smaller banks"
"7771060","7774500"," have made up a large portion of this."
"7775340","7780700"," And just in the last decade, the number of community banks dropped by nearly 40%."
"7780700","7781740"," That is..."
"7782580","7783100"," Ooh. "
"7784140","7784660"," Ooh."
"7784780","7785180"," Ooh."
"7785780","7786300"," Ooh. "
"7787100","7791520"," And each and every one of our communities, we have to make sure that that strength is made."
"7791920","7792440"," Ooh."
"7792920","7793440"," Is she crying?"
"7794320","7802340"," Jamie Diamond pulls out, Jamie Diamond pulls out a tissue for and leans across and drops it on her"
"7802340","7802620"," desk. "
"7802920","7804240"," He's like, sing it to me, honey."
"7804240","7811120"," As the Fed is concerned, the current banking regulatory framework, including stricter capital"
"7811120","7817740"," requirements that Vice Chair Barr has advocated for, how is the Federal Reserve evaluating the"
"7817740","7822020"," downstream impact of these on our smaller community banks?"
"7823320","7828360"," I think community banks, when we think of community banks, we think 10 billion and under mainly in"
"7828360","7833480"," assets, but I don't think under 100 billion, I don't think the proposal that or under consideration"
"7833480","7836500"," are really applying to those banks."
"7836740","7841140"," So I think that it shouldn't be a factor for smaller institutions, which, as you point out, have"
"7841140","7843100"," been declining in number for 30 years. "
"7843480","7844840"," So what do we do to support them?"
"7844980","7850440"," From your perspective, what is the Fed doing to support community banks and rural banks or creating"
"7850440","7851640"," conditions where they can..."
"7851640","7855660"," Jamie Diamond winks in the corner, in the back corner of the room, driving consult, interstate"
"7855660","7858500"," banking, and also just population moving out."
"7858660","7861980"," You see rural areas that have lost half their population, things like that."
"7861980","7863560"," So we can't do much about that. "
"7863920","7865580"," But the piece of it that we can..."
"7865580","7871300"," You see Goldman Sachs is rubbing their hands together, waiting to get their hands on commercial"
"7871300","7872180"," real estate."
"7872720","7877200"," You're like, he already got his regionals, it's our turn for commercial real estate, bro."
"7877810","7884640"," Part of that can just be once fit size regulation, you know, high fixed costs, it will make even"
"7884640","7888000"," small bank, especially small bank models, unprofitable. "
"7888000","7893260"," So we very much try hard to not be part of the problem and to..."
"7893260","7897120"," And we do, as an institution, very much understand how important community banks are for the"
"7897120","7897380"," economy."
"7897380","7898360"," Can you speak to that?"
"7898520","7902680"," Can you tell me what role you believe community banks play that maybe other institutions cannot?"
"7903100","7905120"," So community banks are in their communities."
"7905640","7910400"," So they know the community well and they know the people and the community and the businesses in"
"7910400","7912680"," the community and..."
"7912680","7913120"," Relationship lenders. "
"7913780","7914200"," It's relationship lending."
"7914200","7915580"," Yeah, it's not..."
"7915580","7918740"," I told a story yesterday which happened to me."
"7918880","7924580"," We were moving to Washington and we had this big bank wanted to make the loan and they decided not"
"7924580","7925660"," to make the loan at the last minute. "
"7925820","7927500"," I called the local community bank."
"7927760","7931060"," The loan officer was somebody that knew my family, they knew the house."
"7931940","7932820"," He went to my high school. "
"7933160","7934220"," He was much younger, of course."
"7935000","7935340"," But..."
"7935340","7937280"," And they made the loan very quickly with..."
"7937280","7938360"," And they just understood it."
"7938500","7939380"," It was going to be a great loan. "
"7939540","7940560"," We paid it off long ago."
"7940560","7946340"," So I understand personally that they're better at doing certain things."
"7946580","7950520"," The big banks do certain things very well, but they don't do that very well. "
"7950740","7951620"," And they're smaller businesses."
"7952120","7952420"," Absolutely."
"7952700","7953500"," And just want your commitment. "
"7953740","7955060"," And you'll continue to take a look."
"7955580","7964520"," Whatever type of additional regulating or regulation tools that are kind of perceived to be helpful"
"7964520","7965540"," to maybe..."
"7967260","7969380"," Take a look at how they affect..."
"7969380","7975780"," We make sure that we create conditions where they can flourish."
"7976180","7978660"," Here comes the squeeze, baby!"
"7979060","7979420"," Thank you so much. "
"7979640","7980360"," Thanks, Senator Brett."
"7980580","7987000"," Rest assured, one of the best after yesterday maybe not, but one of the few things that both sides"
"7987000","7993100"," feel strongly and agree on here is that the community banks play a major, major role in our"
"7993100","7997420"," financial system and all of us support the community banks in our communities and know how"
"7997420","7998040"," important they are."
"7998200","7999240"," So thank you for your comments. "
"8000220","8003020"," Senator Tester is recognized from his office."
"8003580","8004640"," Yeah, thank you, Chairman Brown."
"8005080","8007160"," And thank you, Chair Powell, for being..."
"8007160","8008100"," Sellers out there. "
"8008260","8010280"," All they wanted to hear, sellers are like..."
"8010280","8012100"," Sellers are like, I want a correction."
"8012820","8016520"," And I want 50 BPS at this set of hearing, and it's not happening."
"8016860","8017340"," It costs a house. "
"8017840","8019160"," You can't hear about it."
"8019220","8020160"," Unfortable child care."
"8021000","8026560"," And all these are economic conditions that impact hardworking families and small businesses and"
"8026560","8029000"," communities across a migrate state. "
"8029700","8034360"," And the examples are clear, hospitals can't hire nurses, schools can't hire teachers, and if they"
"8034360","8035840"," can't hire them, they have no place to live."
"8036860","8040960"," Even if they can find a place to live, then finding child care is a problem, and then paying for"
"8040960","8043260"," that child care is a problem too."
"8043420","8049880"," Unfortunately, we haven't done much about any of those from a congressional standpoint, but I think"
"8049880","8051500"," all these challenges need to be addressed. "
"8052300","8053860"," But I'm talking to the Chairman of the Fed."
"8054480","8056540"," And so when I asked the Chairman of the Fed..."
"8058760","8059200"," Oooooooohhhhhhh..."
"8059200","8060820"," Housing and child care..."
"8060820","8067720"," I know you guys think about inflation, but do you think about the other things, and do you have"
"8067720","8072160"," tools to address things like housing and child care, or is that..."
"8072160","8073540"," Oh, look at Cuse, baby!"
"8073840","8074540"," Look at NDX!"
"8077840","8085880"," We enforce some of the consumer protection laws, and so we can have an effect as it relates to fair"
"8085880","8090780"," lending and things like that, but ultimately the bigger question is just the availability of"
"8090780","8093320"," housing and its availability near where the jobs are."
"8093780","8096800"," There's not really nothing that our tools can do. "
"8097160","8102520"," The best thing we can do for those issues is to provide an economy where we have stable prices and"
"8102520","8103300"," maximum employment."
"8106180","8110540"," So there's been a lot of talk, and I'm sure there's been a lot of questions asked on this committee"
"8110540","8120500"," about interest rates, and I asked this not to influence you, because I do not believe you should be"
"8120500","8121980"," influenced by political forces."
"8122280","8126200"," The last thing we would need would be the worst thing that could happen is that the United States"
"8126200","8128840"," Senate is dictating monetary policy. "
"8129000","8130060"," We'll leave that up to the pros."
"8130160","8132960"," Oh, what's going on out there?"
"8133240","8135240"," Interest rates continue to be an issue."
"8135700","8141980"," You are fully aware that the debt deal that was struck, clawed back, unspent COVID dollars. "
"8142480","8144860"," You are familiar that there are..."
"8144860","8154420"," NASDAQ leading right now on Southside, on inflation as, I think, the coast by crossing the"
"8154420","8156560"," hourly trigger once again."
"8157000","8159320"," And there's some other things out there that I know you're looking at."
"8159520","8163880"," All it's looking for now is a test of the HT. "
"8166200","8167860"," Successful testing of the HT."
"8169060","8170880"," Rocket ship is here, baby."
"8171640","8177440"," Or I don't think dropping them would be appropriate, but what are the things you're looking at to"
"8177440","8179060"," make those kind of decisions?"
"8179800","8187760"," Well, I would say that if we see the economy performing about as we expect, then two-thirds of the"
"8187760","8191900"," committee really thought it would be appropriate to raise rates a couple of times between now and"
"8191900","8192500"," the end of the year. "
"8192860","8193700"," So what do we expect?"
"8194120","8196139"," We expect continued modest growth."
"8196639","8203639"," We expect continued modest growth of the labor market, gradual better alignment of supply and"
"8203639","8207420"," demand, and we expect inflation to be improving."
"8207420","8214639"," And so if all those things happen, we think we're within a couple of rate hikes of the level we"
"8214639","8215260"," need to get to. "
"8215360","8222040"," We want to get to a level where we're confident that inflation is and will continue to move, is"
"8222040","8224700"," moving and will continue to move down to 2% over time."
"8224980","8227480"," That's the, and not a higher level, that level."
"8228639","8232379"," And so that's why we've slowed down here as we think we are getting..."
"8232379","8233459"," Always slowed down. "
"8233700","8234200"," We haven't paused."
"8234580","8235440"," We've slowed down."
"8236280","8240400"," What factors are you going to look at that would determine a lowering in its straight sense?"
"8240860","8241459"," Oh, here we go. "
"8241620","8248420"," We don't see that happening anytime soon, and the test for that is that we're confident that"
"8248420","8250700"," inflation is moving back down to our 2% goal."
"8250980","8252520"," We want to have some confidence."
"8253480","8261540"," So, and I will say in the summary of economic projections that my participants and I filed last"
"8261540","8270200"," week, I think by the end of next year, by the end of 2024, the median participant did have some"
"8270200","8271080"," rate cuts. "
"8271600","8278680"," But that's going to depend on how the economy performs, and inflation has just consistently proven"
"8278680","8283160"," more persistent than we've expected and that other forecasters have expected."
"8283420","8288260"," So it's going to have to await a time when we're confident that inflation is moving down to 2%."
"8289480","8291340"," So, I want to talk about regulation. "
"8291860","8294860"," I know it's been touched on, Katie Britt touched on a little bit."
"8296559","8301160"," And I know Michael Barr oversees the Fed's regulation actions."
"8302500","8311540"," But when we passed 2155, the bill to give reg relief to small banks in particular, there was a"
"8311540","8314080"," sentence in there about tailoring. "
"8314080","8319400"," So that, even if you had a community bank, a small community bank, if they had a risky portfolio,"
"8320139","8325500"," they could, you could regulate them to match that risk and bigger banks, the same thing."
"8327280","8336240"," Can you tell me what Barr is thinking or what you're advising him when it comes to, because I think"
"8336240","8340020"," we've all agreed, as Chairman just said, we want to protect community banks."
"8340299","8341920"," They're not, they're not the problem out there. "
"8341920","8346120"," In fact, they're the ones that provide access to capital for these communities so they can grow and"
"8346120","8347059"," economy can happen."
"8347680","8352900"," Can you tell me what your interaction is with Barr when it comes to regulation and where you think"
"8352900","8353440"," he's going?"
"8354219","8360639"," So broadly speaking, when regulations need to be voted on to Board of Governors, and I'm one of the"
"8360639","8365040"," people who votes, I'm also Chair of the Committee, so that that's the nature of the interaction."
"8366760","8372400"," In terms of the, what you're really talking about, regulation for smaller institutions, I would say"
"8372400","8378260"," I think it's important that regulation be appropriate for an institution's size and risks. "
"8378920","8384120"," So it's not a one size fits all approach to regulation and, you know, the largest institutions need"
"8384120","8388780"," highest capital standards and and the most regulation."
"8389160","8393940"," And as you get down to community banks, the regulation and supervision should reflect their size"
"8393940","8394520"," and risk."
"8395520","8397320"," I apologize, Mr. Chairman, for running over. "
"8397320","8399460"," Thank you, Chairman Powell."
"8402060","8402920"," Thanks, Senator Tester."
"8403280","8404980"," Senator Kramer of North Dakota is recognized. "
"8405480","8406040"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"8406260","8409360"," Thank you, Chairman, for being here today."
"8409860","8415640"," I know several of my Republican colleagues have been asking you about Basel III and potential for"
"8415640","8418580"," some changes, obviously, capital requirements. "
"8420180","8425400"," Part of, I'm afraid part of what they're trying to do is fix a liquidity crisis at regional banks"
"8425400","8428500"," with a capital fix, which I don't think the two necessarily go."
"8429080","8436080"," Hand in hand, in fact, it seems to me, while you've been trying to engineer a soft landing, and not"
"8436080","8441780"," have taken a pause, and I'm certainly not critical of that, I can't fathom why the Fed would want"
"8441780","8446160"," to raise capital requirements when we could be facing what's kind of funny, right?"
"8446280","8449780"," You're hearing this guy is like, you're trying to engineer a soft landing."
"8450300","8453800"," Oh, wait a minute, oops, I don't want to try to criticize that. "
"8454020","8456000"," I actually want to crash the economy if possible."
"8456000","8462360"," It doesn't make sense to increase capital requirements for banks."
"8463280","8469280"," I think that's always the trade-off, is higher capital means more stable, stronger banks that can"
"8469280","8474040"," last through bigger crises and things like that, but it's continuum, because that also means"
"8474560","8478160"," slightly less capital being available and higher price of capital. "
"8478460","8483560"," So, and the thing with capital requirements is the answer isn't zero and it's not a hundred, you've"
"8483560","8484660"," got to find the right place."
"8484660","8491820"," I would also say that the capital in the form of the, what I've been briefed on is a proposal"
"8491820","8497080"," where the big capital increases are really for the largest institutions and much less so for"
"8497080","8500340"," institutions that are not among the, particularly the 8G SIBs."
"8501180","8503420"," But what's the motivation for that?"
"8503940","8511640"," I mean, you've just articulated the challenge, obviously, better than I did, but why the big, for"
"8511640","8512520"," example, the big institutions?"
"8512800","8515540"," What's the situation that would require?"
"8516640","8523100"," Your point, we spent many years raising capital liquidity standards for the largest institutions"
"8523100","8524600"," and appropriately so. "
"8524800","8527740"," I supported all of that and I'm glad that I did."
"8528100","8532540"," I think it's been warranted and I think that the banks, large banks have competed very successfully"
"8532540","8537340"," with this high capital and I think further increases are going to be on the table."
"8537560","8542240"," We always thought there would be some further increase at the end of Basel III globally, but I"
"8542240","8547300"," think it's going to be on the increases are going to need to be justified. "
"8548720","8552300"," I'm going to get to another question, but you said something a little earlier that I wanted to get"
"8552300","8556760"," to in response to Senator Tester."
"8557800","8561280"," Is your interaction with each other confined only to public meetings?"
"8561540","8562840"," Is that not at all?"
"8563320","8565240"," Not at all, no, not at all."
"8565240","8567520"," You try to persuade each other at the water cooler. "
"8567800","8569420"," I talked to all my colleagues a lot."
"8569660","8572260"," I'm not one of those people who can just sit in your office all day."
"8572380","8573700"," I'm popping up and running around. "
"8573920","8574520"," I'm one of those people."
"8574960","8579680"," Just because in the interaction, it sort of sounded like that and I used to be in a three-member"
"8579680","8586260"," commission, not that regular meetings in conversations right through the weekend."
"8586600","8587820"," We talk frequently. "
"8590300","8595720"," In an earlier exchange, I think it was Senator Tillis."
"8596420","8601740"," You talked a little bit about digital economy challenges and you're considering some changes to"
"8601740","8604780"," reflect how quickly individuals can move money."
"8605700","8611000"," I think a lot of people would maintain that while you always need to have the foundation to weather"
"8611000","8619180"," the storm, so to speak, such as SBB, you might not even have a storm, but for the fast ability"
"8619180","8623220"," for somebody to spark a run, for example, or to move money quickly. "
"8624240","8626780"," But you didn't elaborate on what kind of changes you might be considering."
"8626960","8631260"," Do you have some personal thoughts on it or things that you've been talking about as you're running"
"8631260","8632220"," around talking to each other?"
"8632680","8633160"," Yes."
"8633920","8637900"," I'm not the biggest expert on this, but I so that's two of us. "
"8638160","8646140"," The thing that's clear is that our existing liquidity requirements didn't assume they didn't take"
"8646140","8650000"," into contemplation at all the idea that you could have a run this fast."
"8650220","8653840"," And so there are things that are embedded in the net stable funding ratio and the liquidity"
"8653840","8657740"," coverage ratio that reflect an understanding of how fast a run happens."
"8658540","8665860"," And we now learn that so that's why I think there is regulatory response is going to be appropriate"
"8665860","8666920"," here, not just supervisory. "
"8667340","8672620"," In addition, you would have thought, and we thought, and by the way, the board is every bit as"
"8672620","8677080"," accountable as San Francisco fed on this, that supervision could have been much more forward"
"8677080","8679380"," leaning on the liquidity issue than it was."
"8679760","8681200"," And so we're going to address that too."
"8681440","8687120"," No, great point, because these guys have heard me use my soccer referee illustration. "
"8687400","8693840"," If you warn the offender over and over and over but never throw up a card, they just offend worse"
"8693840","8694480"," the next time."
"8695420","8698680"," And so I think that's an obvious finding, and I would concur with you."
"8698860","8702260"," But the whole issue of the run itself is also problematic. "
"8702780","8708480"," While not maybe directly jurisdictional to any one regulator as policymakers and regulators"
"8708480","8711780"," together, we should we should find a better solution."
"8712000","8714400"," But I thank you again for your services for being here."
"8714480","8715060"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman. "
"8715140","8717480"," Senator Warren from Massachusetts is recognized."
"8717960","8718900"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"8719220","8726640"," So in 2010, Congress passed Dodd-Frank to make banking regulations tougher and to avoid future bank"
"8726640","8727280"," collapses. "
"8728100","8733940"," And very soon after that, bank CEO started lobbying for weaker rules."
"8734320","8737380"," Now, Chair Powell, you also lobbied for weaker rules."
"8737860","8744420"," When President Trump first nominated you as Fed Chair in 2017, you testified actually in this very"
"8744420","8754420"," room, I think, that you intended to quote, consider appropriate ways to ease regulatory burdens for"
"8754420","8754940"," the banks. "
"8755620","8761920"," And when I asked you if there were any rules, any rules at all, that you thought ought to be"
"8761920","8764840"," made stronger, do you remember what you said?"
"8765220","8767640"," I think I pointed to the net stable funding ratio."
"8768080","8769600"," No, actually that's not what you said."
"8770060","8773740"," You said, honestly, Senator, I think they're tough enough. "
"8774220","8776470"," You couldn't point to anything you thought should be tougher."
"8777490","8780370"," In 2018, in the event we strengthened the net stable funding."
"8780430","8784550"," Well, in 2018, you supported Congress's weakening of those rules. "
"8785190","8789630"," You led the Fed in hacking away at one rule after another."
"8790130","8796330"," According to the Fed's own analysis of the Silicon Valley bank failure, you weakened the rules in"
"8796330","8797250"," multiple ways."
"8797250","8798610"," You reduce capital requirements. "
"8799450","8801510"," You weaken liquidity risk management."
"8802050","8806950"," You skipped out on using enhanced stress testing for banks with tens of billions of dollars in"
"8806950","8808610"," assets and more."
"8809310","8816430"," And the result was that the second, third, and fourth largest bank failures in U.S. history, which"
"8816430","8820970"," together required $23 billion in bailout money. "
"8821390","8825150"," In fact, you now hold the record in a single year."
"8825310","8833590"," The FDIC has been forced to rescue more giant failed banks on your launch than any Fed chair in"
"8833590","8834550"," American history."
"8835610","8843310"," Chair Powell, do you agree with Vice Chair Barr's conclusion that the Fed bears a big share of the"
"8843310","8847470"," responsibility for the failure of SVB?"
"8847470","8856610"," I certainly think that our supervision has been shown to have been lax in not being assertive"
"8856610","8856790"," enough. "
"8857070","8863470"," I think that the supervisors saw the right issues but weren't forceful enough in hindsight."
"8864570","8868090"," I think that's certainly a fair conclusion."
"8869310","8871670"," Those regulations were weakened. "
"8872150","8879610"," Those supervisors were clearly asleep at the switch for more than five years under your watch."
"8880070","8885010"," And I'll just say again, this is exactly why I opposed your nomination in 2017."
"8885730","8893090"," The decisions that you made, the votes that you took and the things that you said helped caused"
"8893090","8894190"," this mess. "
"8894770","8900850"," And when you were up for reappointment in 2021, I opposed your confirmation because I believed that"
"8900850","8906050"," your continued leadership would be dangerous to our financial system."
"8906650","8909270"," And the Fed's own report confirms that."
"8909830","8917590"," So yesterday, Chair Powell, this committee voted on a bill to help hold CEOs accountable when their"
"8917590","8919370"," actions blow up banks. "
"8920090","8926570"," At the Fed, you are the one who lobbied, who drafted, and who voted for weaker rules."
"8927490","8934490"," And you were ultimately responsible for the team of Fed supervisors who fell down on the job."
"8935330","8936890"," Do you just heads up here?"
"8937090","8937310"," We do. "
"8937430","8939770"," We are getting some confirmation to move to the upside."
"8940030","8940950"," Be very careful here."
"8941550","8948150"," I just want you to note here that price is attempting to get over the daily trigger. "
"8948350","8949910"," I'm going to show you guys here in a one minute chart."
"8950450","8951250"," Let's be wary here."
"8952910","8955530"," Begin to see it happening once again, right?"
"8955750","8963650"," Have the first break above failure down here, caught back up confirmation boom. "
"8964050","8967090"," And we're beginning to attempt to make a run higher."
"8967390","8972870"," If you see this white line, same thing as before, you see this white line cross and price stay"
"8972870","8973230"," above."
"8973790","8976590"," And I really want to see this red line be aggressive. "
"8976590","8980690"," I don't want to see this red line flattening out any of that kind of nonsense."
"8981910","8988790"," As long as price and this white line begin to cross here, getting very, very aggressive here to the"
"8988790","8989470"," to the upside."
"8989750","8990670"," Be very careful here. "
"8991930","8993130"," That's what I'm trying to ask."
"8993670","8997790"," I'm trying to know this, you know, the sellers, man, like these sellers, you saw them, right?"
"8997970","9000070"," The closes are like, Wham, see you later."
"9000710","9001910"," Get fucked, right?"
"9002130","9003130"," They're going to try to get in here. "
"9003270","9004410"," Wham, get out of here."
"9004870","9007750"," There's a lot of celerage out there."
"9007850","9010430"," They want a specific price to buy the spy, right?"
"9011110","9012630"," You know that who these people are. "
"9012770","9015330"," These are, you know what this is, right?"
"9016530","9020670"," And these of them said they plan to keep every penny of that money."
"9021190","9027570"," And now we have the chair of the Federal Reserve who led the charge to weaken bank regulations who"
"9027570","9028230"," oversaw."
"9028690","9028890"," Yeah. "
"9028890","9031110"," So like right here, you guys want velocity."
"9032090","9035990"," You're what I'm always looking for here is mostly 30-minute velocity."
"9036790","9041850"," And what I'm looking for here in this 30, this is a 30-minute velocity here. "
"9042150","9045130"," We've got the big shark coming up from down below, right?"
"9045330","9047010"," Delly is like, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum."
"9047450","9050010"," But right here, you see this bottoming right here."
"9050530","9052270"," And we're looking for this move. "
"9052650","9054510"," Yeah, we're looking for yesterday too, right?"
"9054630","9059290"," And that close, I was trying to buy some cheap calls from that close there, right?"
"9059470","9064370"," To see if this is a fake out and you saw them like slam us down into that close, right?"
"9065230","9069630"," And this is just building and building for a face ripper to the upside here."
"9069990","9072270"," Try to close all this stuff out up here."
"9072470","9073390"," So just be careful. "
"9074650","9081610"," If we start breaking above here and sellers are overrun, we are going to squeeze here."
"9082110","9089890"," And what we're looking for is on a one-minute inflation."
"9090390","9095430"," We don't see the one or the five-minute rolling over, do we?"
"9095550","9098630"," We don't see like this roll happening here in the one-and-five. "
"9099410","9102050"," We don't currently don't see price below the one-and-five."
"9102650","9110970"," If the one-and-five-minute begin to eclipse and price is able to stay above and confirm that move"
"9110970","9114510"," higher, you're going to get ready to jump on that trade."
"9115030","9119810"," And you already can see here, these sellers are like, fuck you, we're not going up or crashing. "
"9120410","9121350"," We're in a correction."
"9122290","9124550"," You were tuning in earlier to the program."
"9124990","9132410"," I went through the entire thing with you on how you have an edge versus traditional stuff out"
"9132410","9132630"," there. "
"9132770","9134470"," So we're paying close attention to this."
"9134730","9136490"," And the more time we spend here, right?"
"9136570","9137230"," We talk about this."
"9137390","9141330"," The more time we spend here, and if price is able to stay up there, that red line comes up,"
"9141330","9146310"," that white line comes up, and you're just looking for that one moment where it begins to rip some"
"9146310","9147070"," faces off. "
"9147250","9148970"," We know that ball is leaving the market."
"9149910","9155330"," Unfortunately, we had an increase in spending that exceeded the increase in revenue."
"9156030","9158750"," So if you spend more money than you take in, you still end up with it. "
"9158770","9161390"," They're just watching this here, watching this here."
"9162190","9165170"," You want to see that big explosive move to the upside here."
"9165490","9166570"," And they're trying to sell you. "
"9166670","9167130"," They're going to try."
"9168030","9169190"," It's sure you right now."
"9169190","9170710"," They do not want to see this happen. "
"9171250","9172730"," They do not want to see a reversal."
"9172970","9178970"," There's a lot of money right now that are like, sorry, we're going down to the depths of hell here."
"9179050","9179510"," We're going to correct. "
"9180530","9182730"," So they're going to revenge trade all of this."
"9182810","9186190"," You're going to get people out there just fucking pounding for this shit to go down."
"9195660","9196880"," And that's it right now. "
"9197000","9198100"," That looks like the end of the broadcast."
"9198620","9199640"," That is it looks like it's it."
"9203040","9209900"," Just check this, make sure it didn't look like I didn't think that was over, but they just shut the"
"9209900","9213940"," broadcast down for that fed meeting on the Senate hearing. "
"9214100","9216100"," That's kind of it looks like they just shut it down."
"9216480","9218960"," It looked in the way they concluded it, but maybe they did."
"9232320","9235320"," It looks like they might have concluded it prematurely. "
"9236740","9237680"," Am I wrong on that?"
"9237860","9240220"," That it seemed like they had an actual conclusion of that meeting."
"9251180","9252060"," It's kind of odd."
"9259370","9259810"," Yeah. "
"9263110","9264150"," That's kind of wonky."
"9265290","9270490"," I wonder if they had it pre-set to shut off or somebody's butt hit the stop button or something."
"9274790","9278210"," Corporate profits, nor do I believe we must sacrifice a safe. "
"9278410","9278630"," All right."
"9278670","9279690"," I got another source here."
"9280330","9281450"," Freezing money for the biggest. "
"9281650","9282690"," I got another live source."
"9283030","9283250"," Hold on."
"9285550","9285990"," Gains. "
"9285990","9287610"," Thank you for joining us, Chair Powell."
"9287910","9290370"," Today, I look forward to working with you to strengthen our economy."
"9290790","9296330"," For senators who wish to submit questions, they're due one week from today, Thursday, June 29th. "
"9296430","9301170"," For Chair Powell, please submit responses to questions for the record 45 days from the day you"
"9301170","9301550"," receive them."
"9301710","9303950"," Senator Scott has some comments he'd like to make."
"9304270","9304910"," Hey, sure. "
"9305090","9306490"," I've still got a live feed here."
"9308050","9311310"," Here, led to the challenges that we're facing with our debt."
"9312090","9314590"," I've got a live feed here with Chair Powell still. "
"9315070","9321130"," 2022 was $4.9 trillion, more than 30 percent higher than 2000."
"9321510","9323930"," I think that that feed just cut out across YouTube."
"9324270","9325710"," I've got a live feed of them still. "
"9325890","9332210"," We should just recognize as a clear fact is that if your revenue goes up, and that's what happened"
"9332210","9336390"," after the TCJA in 2018 and 2019, we had an increase in revenue."
"9336550","9339130"," Yeah, I've got another source here for you playing in the background."
"9339370","9342530"," We had an increase in spending that exceeded the increase in revenue. "
"9343030","9346190"," So if you spend more money than you take in, you still end up with a deficit."
"9347230","9347810"," Thank you."
"9347870","9350730"," And of course, Senator Scott recognizes that we had a pandemic. "
"9350970","9352090"," The committee is adjourned."
"9415460","9417200"," It looks like that one shut off too."
"9418380","9419900"," That broadcast is done. "
"9420060","9422020"," I got the gavel strike on that one."
"9422260","9422780"," So it is done."
"9422940","9423160"," You're right. "
"9423440","9424360"," Somebody out there said it was done."
"9424460","9424800"," They were correct."
"9424980","9425900"," I heard that gavel slam. "
"9426660","9428860"," So that is it right now for J-POW."
"9430220","9586690"," All right,"
"9586770","9587810"," so I'm back with the hair watching this."
"9589270","9590050"," Just a second here. "
"9590150","9591610"," I'm doing a bunch of work here in the background."
"9593890","9595470"," So what did you guys, let me know in the chat."
"9595670","9599650"," What did you guys take away from that hearing today?"
"9600830","9606010"," It seemed it didn't seem as rough as it has been in the past at those Senate hearings. "
"9609130","9611970"," We have a three trigger, a bull trigger cluster forming air."
"9612070","9617330"," We've got sellers up on high wanting to get that more down right."
"9617890","9625930"," We've got the to the downside we have S1, S2, S3 at 4.33, 85, 4.32, 73. "
"9626730","9629550"," We have the JPM caller that I think is right here."
"9629650","9630530"," It could be wrong in this."
"9631410","9634450"," I've got my price target down here at 4.30, 15. "
"9635430","9637990"," I really want to we've got the daily trigger down below even that."
"9638130","9645110"," It's I believe bread around 4.27, 4.28. And you've got sellers that want to get down here."
"9645290","9651390"," We and that JPM caller does to some extent, act as some kind of a magnet that could keep us"
"9651390","9654150"," range bound trading into end of month flows. "
"9654250","9657190"," Of course, people waiting for the end of month."
"9657390","9659490"," It is kind of a magnet here."
"9660130","9665110"," And then we've got the attempts every day for a squeeze trade to the upside. "
"9665110","9675050"," We also know something else that if we don't get a green Thursday, normally we get a"
"9675050","9675570"," green Thursday."
"9675970","9682810"," If we don't get the green Thursday, that the probability of a massive green Friday is huge."
"9683630","9686430"," It's like 85% of the time, 90% of the time. "
"9687090","9689850"," This is generally a green Thursday."
"9690650","9695070"," And if we don't get it, we tend to get a massive move to the upside by Friday."
"9695350","9701630"," Now a note here too is that we can make a comment that I believe Larry Williams said, look for"
"9701630","9704130"," a two day short on Thursday and Friday. "
"9714310","9715470"," I'll be right back with you."
"10216350","10219110"," Remember here, bulls do not have a trade."
"10220250","10225990"," They do not have a trade unless they get above with a confirmation above the hourly trigger. "
"10226670","10233830"," You have to have a rip higher confirmation and begin the move higher for buyers to be in control"
"10233830","10234130"," here."
"10234310","10235550"," So I'm going to show it to you guys really quick."
"10250360","10257090"," Buyers need to get above the hourly trigger right here. "
"10257410","10260110"," They need to get above it and they need to get above it."
"10260270","10261050"," It's a woman of chariot."
"10261270","10261390"," It's good. "
"10266050","10268410"," As of right now, sellers are in control."
"10268770","10274150"," They've also, sellers have also had one confirmation up, one rejection here, and they're just"
"10274150","10279290"," looking to get underneath and get this white line and this red line for a cross to go to the"
"10279290","10279550"," downside."
"10280330","10282130"," So right now, sellers are still in control. "
"10282430","10289590"," Buyers are not in control until unless price gets above the hourly trigger with the white and the"
"10289590","10290470"," red line above."
"10290770","10293350"," Otherwise, sellers are still in control here."
"10306070","10307770"," Oh boy, these fucking hedge funds, man. "
"10307890","10308930"," They're just like, I want to get paid."
"10309470","10310650"," I don't care how I get paid."
"10310730","10311470"," It looks like it's me. "
"10312510","10314930"," Looks like they're like, I don't care about where you're going."
"10315150","10315770"," I want my money."
"10504230","10508850"," Just to recap here on Jerome Powell, Powell saying that the Fed doesn't see rate cuts happening"
"10508850","10509750"," anytime soon. "
"10510250","10513530"," He does think that they're within a couple of rate hikes of the level they need to be."
"10514010","10515970"," So they're not trying to get above the rate of inflation."
"10516310","10519690"," They feel as though the rate of inflation is going to come down and meet the next couple of rate"
"10519690","10519950"," hikes. "
"10520290","10521630"," They're close, but still not there."
"10522690","10527650"," Powell is also saying a strong majority of the FMC sees two more rate hikes."
"10528050","10530650"," My forecasts are very similar to the four committees forecasts. "
"10531870","10533310"," So nothing else to see here."
"10533410","10538850"," Nothing has changed since his message during the last rate hike decision."
"10541350","10543030"," As I may look through and see anything else. "
"10547370","10552730"," We do expect the unemployment rate to go up a little bit, but that's still not negative."
"10553530","10557270"," As long as we have the key point here is whenever you hear some stuff like that, you got to"
"10557270","10560910"," have taken a consideration to other points, right?"
"10561210","10565270"," The jobs available, of course, employment rates, right?"
"10565930","10566990"," And the unemployment rate."
"10567150","10570830"," They could kind of go hand in hand in this in this discussion. "
"10572970","10581130"," If anything else that was said by him, that was important to hear."
"10583730","10585910"," Squeezing right now looks like the hedge is coming off."
"10587170","10588770"," I mean, I'm honest with you. "
"10588810","10592510"," I don't know, like what else we got PCE?"
"10594470","10598210"," He did say in that meeting they were questioning about PCE."
"10599570","10604750"," And his statement to that was that we're seeing progress in supply chains."
"10605390","10608430"," We've not seen much progress in services inflation. "
"10609750","10610750"," I agree with that."
"10610830","10614870"," I think all of you can agree with that that I was just looking at some posts last night."
"10615570","10624090"," Some person had bought a kid meal for a child in a small fry or something had like six different"
"10624090","10624990"," fees on it. "
"10629580","10631700"," Yeah, meeting is over right now."
"10632800","10634000"," Meeting is done."
"10634380","10637740"," The only other thing we I don't think we have any events on Monday. "
"10637860","10643500"," It's kind of fascinating because we've got let's see the calendar coming up."
"10652830","10655290"," We just review it really quick here."
"10655730","10660890"," So tomorrow you have the big one, of course, is PMI, right?"
"10661930","10663890"," Services and manufacturing PMI. "
"10664010","10667550"," Those are both at 8.30. On Monday, there's nothing scheduled."
"10667710","10673430"," Remember that this too is the week that we head into the 4th of July weekend."
"10674630","10679230"," You will have a slowing of market activity as we head into that Friday. "
"10679790","10682070"," We're going to tell you right now that some people are gone."
"10682330","10683070"," They're already on vacation."
"10684330","10688050"," As we head into this weekend, I shouldn't say that I should say at the end of this weekend, you'll"
"10688050","10690750"," see people begin to leave on vacations. "
"10690890","10695990"," Most people with money, they're gone for like a week, two weeks during 4th of July."
"10696410","10700310"," Some people are only gone for a week, but they will be gone at least by next Friday, right?"
"10701090","10705030"," So not this Friday, but next Friday you'll see people start to exit the market."
"10706250","10708530"," Flows should slow down into that Friday. "
"10708530","10710270"," Traditionally, they do."
"10710850","10719790"," Winky also made a note that historically on the week, so like the Friday of"
"10719790","10724350"," 4th of July into July 5th, retailers take over, right?"
"10724490","10724910"," You know that."
"10726750","10730090"," Flows slow down and retailers have a party. "
"10730490","10736110"," It's usually like, you guys know how like between Christmas and New Year's, everybody's on"
"10736110","10743310"," vacation, and it's like a it's like a it's not real, but you know, you're like, oh, the retail"
"10743310","10748810"," bulls took over and they ran the market up and then we come back on January 3rd and we pounded"
"10748810","10749910"," all back down again."
"10751170","10754270"," And so there's that there's some hope for that."
"10754370","10759810"," I'm sure that there are retailers out there that'll be discussing that, anticipating that. "
"10760010","10761530"," And that happens a high percentage of the time."
"10761690","10765490"," It's like 86, 87% of the time."
"10766170","10770150"," So you have to consider that into end of month into next Friday, right?"
"10770390","10774010"," So then we get end of month flows into Friday, right?"
"10774110","10777750"," So there's a bunch of stuff going on still into the background. "
"10778130","10780790"," We do see, you may not see it."
"10780970","10781590"," I see it."
"10782150","10783850"," A lot of people see it out there. "
"10784230","10789410"," We're not getting the downside move in cash market."
"10789570","10792130"," We're getting it in low liquidity environments."
"10792810","10794770"," We're not getting it in in RTH. "
"10795850","10799650"," I mean fucking nine 30 until four p.m. You're not seeing it."
"10799750","10804890"," Sometimes you'll see it the last 15 minutes or so, but you are seeing the demand is still there,"
"10805030","10805130"," right?"
"10805350","10808950"," In cash market, there's still inflows coming into the market."
"10810070","10813970"," And you also got people want a certain price, right?"
"10813970","10818790"," If you want to cool down, put some time, let the market cool down in 10 to a month. "
"10819870","10822970"," You've got big money that's kept trying to come into the market and see it."
"10823090","10824270"," You can actually see it every day."
"10824910","10827530"," There's large flows entering the market right now. "
"10827650","10830250"," These aren't retail flows, hedge fund flows, speculator flows."
"10831050","10835730"," These are bigger, bigger participants are entering this market, whether you like it or not."
"10836370","10838670"," Whether price goes down or not doesn't matter. "
"10839130","10840910"," You can see these inflows coming in."
"10841570","10842670"," They have to chase."
"10843050","10845530"," You already know they're going to have to chase the second half of the year. "
"10847330","10849330"," They're going to want to let make it look good, right?"
"10849450","10850650"," Have a good year one way or another."
"10850650","10852710"," They missed the entire first half of the year."
"10854030","10856230"," And then you've got people that are going to be waiting, right?"
"10856410","10862730"," People like me, like every quarter, so each quarter, as we come into the end of that quarter, we"
"10862730","10863530"," just finished. "
"10863750","10867850"," This seems like a long time ago, we just finished OPEC's, right?"
"10868030","10869010"," Quarterly OPEC's."
"10869630","10874050"," I know it seems like it seems like it was like two months ago, but it was only last week."
"10874650","10880530"," So like where we just finished OPEC's, the quarterly trade is being wrapped up by most people. "
"10881270","10887210"," Any large positioning, most of us are out and looking for the next dip to put size on the market,"
"10887210","10887510"," right?"
"10888430","10891690"," Looking for that end of month to find out what to do for next quarter."
"10892670","10896270"," Matter of fact, two, three weeks ago, I think I was saying to you guys, yeah, you'll start seeing"
"10896270","10903010"," people exiting the market, taking profit and looking for what to expect in Q three, right?"
"10903210","10905190"," So we have that's big news."
"10905230","10909870"," Like as we come into the end of month into Friday, people are going to be looking. "
"10910290","10913450"," People are going to be like, I want to know what the JPM collar is for the next quarter."
"10914030","10917830"," I want to know what the top top target is, the bottom target of their raise, and if they lowered"
"10917830","10922190"," it as the same, we're going to do the sideways and up trade into into Q three, or we're going"
"10922190","10926210"," to go down to the depths of how is there an expectation that we're going to the depths of how"
"10926210","10932430"," in Q three, you may not care, but I know that there's real traders out there that are like, I"
"10932430","10936550"," want to fucking know, are we going sideways, we're going sideways and up, we're going up, we're"
"10936550","10940490"," going down for Q three, and they're going to pay attention to that shit."
"10941190","10945870"," So they're going to be looking for it to make some decisions on what to expect. "
"10946710","10951930"," You'll see people in the stream asking, what does the strikes mean for us for Q three?"
"10952810","10954870"," And the market will digest that information."
"10956290","10957970"," There's some good plays on that too."
"10958710","10963990"," On those end of month flows, which one of the fascinating parts here is that it's kind of neat. "
"10964390","10971470"," So on Friday, the 30th, mark this down on your calendar, write this shit down."
"10972730","10979530"," But on the 30th, if if they put some heavy hedging on the market, if we get heavy hedging in"
"10979530","10984910"," the morning, a lot of these banks, what they do in these end of quarter cycles, is they will"
"10984910","10990150"," sprinkle in zero to eight calls to not disrupt the market."
"10990730","10996670"," So you'll get these disruptive flows into the end of month or end of quarter, you get disruptive"
"10996670","10998770"," flows all day long. "
"10999290","11003990"," And it's to not disrupt the market so they load up on these fucking zero date calls."
"11004890","11009490"," And at the end of the day, or whenever they're done with their flows coming in, the fucking market"
"11009490","11011450"," just rips faces off into the bell."
"11012330","11016170"," Not all the time, but enough that you pay attention to when it does happen. "
"11016870","11021010"," So that's another date to look forward to this upcoming Friday or not upcoming next Friday."
"11022430","11024650"," That is the 30th."
"11025390","11035310"," So you've got the 4th of July weekend, and you"
"11035310","11040250"," likely have some kind of a phase trip in rally at some point on on that Friday on the 30th. "
"11040250","11042430"," Let's look forward to solid economic calendar stuff."
"11043590","11046390"," So next week, that's what we've got."
"11046530","11050490"," We've got we've got coming in tomorrow morning, PCE. "
"11050590","11052970"," If those numbers are good, we're fucking going to the moon, right?"
"11054010","11056890"," If we don't go to the moon today, we're going to the moon tomorrow, one or the other."
"11057310","11059210"," I don't care where fucking prices today."
"11060330","11064430"," And then so next week, we've got the Fed budget, assuming I got the wrong week. "
"11065510","11067210"," We got nothing scheduled for Monday."
"11068590","11074370"," On Tuesday, we've got durable goods at 8.30. We've got a case Shiller at nine new home sales"
"11074370","11076790"," consumer confidence at 10."
"11078010","11082470"," Wednesday, we've got a US trade balance, retail inventories, wholesale inventories. "
"11083090","11086310"," Thursday, we got initial jobs, job claims, pending home sales for May."
"11088610","11094050"," Friday, we've got a PCI, a PCE index on the on the 30th."
"11094210","11096410"," It was all on the 30th, by the way, the same day we'd all those flows. "
"11097190","11102170"," Poor PC index, PCE index year over year, PCE, consumer sentiments."
"11102910","11109110"," And then what's crazy is right now, we've got no news until we got these wrong, I think it's"
"11109110","11109510"," fucking wrong."
"11109690","11110190"," Hold on a second here. "
"11110270","11110770"," God damn it."
"11112770","11113450"," Hold on here."
"11114630","11115490"," Screwing this all up. "
"11116390","11118730"," Hold on one second here."
"11120210","11121170"," I'm going to get this right."
"11122290","11124150"," Maybe this calendar ends ends right here. "
"11126730","11129890"," Those are claims on Thursday, Friday, PC, and then that's it."
"11130050","11130510"," That's all I've got."
"11131030","11135150"," Let me go back to, I've got no other reports for July right now for the fifth, so I'll take"
"11135150","11135730"," a look at that later. "
"11136970","11139590"," So that's all I've got for you is into the end of a month."
"11140210","11145810"," So just on that stay on that same topic, the question becomes, how are we moving up here, right?"
"11145970","11147330"," Are we moving up into next week?"
"11148310","11153610"," We're going to pin to this JPM caller, are we going to close all of this stuff above?"
"11153850","11154610"," So let's take a look at that."
"11158750","11160050"," So I got some air flow in here. "
"11160990","11164570"," My HVAC system is not enough to keep this place cool."
"11165450","11167450"," So let's take a look at a higher time frame here."
"11167870","11169250"," There's not much left, right?"
"11169950","11172210"," There's not much left here for the bears. "
"11173850","11176030"," And you can see we're turning, right?"
"11176910","11177970"," We're turning here."
"11178550","11180470"," I want you to look this in a 15-minute chart."
"11180690","11181610"," We're turning to the upside. "
"11181990","11184290"," You can see, hold on here, let me get rid of this."
"11186150","11190070"," So for all that bluster, so let's get an hour chart, right?"
"11190270","11191890"," This is what the bears are looking for, right?"
"11192050","11193010"," What are the bears looking for?"
"11194250","11197310"," Bears looking for an hourly trend to the downside."
"11197730","11198650"," They're looking for a bear. "
"11201120","11202460"," One to three weeks of down."
"11202780","11203980"," And what's going on here?"
"11204740","11206960"," We're getting a little turn, aren't we?"
"11207740","11209520"," Getting a little turn here, do you see it?"
"11211140","11215620"," That hourly that was looking extremely bearish here, not happening, is it?"
"11216640","11217560"," It's coming up."
"11218520","11220800"," It's a reversal to the upside. "
"11224040","11226860"," All that, all that stuff going away, right?"
"11227060","11227340"," Look at that."
"11227840","11229660"," What does that, so does that look like to you?"
"11230340","11231920"," A rip your fucking face off."
"11232120","11233400"," Rally is what it looks like to me. "
"11235740","11238500"," Looks like we want to close a bunch of shit to the upside."
"11240080","11242620"," I want to see fucking 439, 440."
"11242620","11244540"," I want to see 441. "
"11244780","11249880"," I want to return to the scene of the crime by Friday at 442."
"11251220","11255980"," And next week, we can, we can pin back down there, hopefully."
"11259540","11261940"," So let's take a look into next week here. "
"11266840","11268660"," I already know what we're doing here."
"11268840","11269800"," I already know what to say."
"11270860","11273800"," We got the JPM collar pin down here, right?"
"11275280","11276660"," So what do we got going on?"
"11276940","11277980"," Where's the 30th?"
"11278960","11280360"," What do we got over here?"
"11285540","11286300"," There's 630. "
"11287340","11288740"," Boom, right there, right?"
"11289840","11291760"," It's going to go down after July, man."
"11291860","11292440"," It's going down July."
"11292700","11293360"," When is it going down July?"
"11294080","11295300"," Probably not until the 5th. "
"11295620","11296320"," Okay, so what are we doing?"
"11297000","11298820"," Where are we going until we get that?"
"11299100","11301140"," What about the pin down here?"
"11304420","11306480"," So some things we do know though, isn't there?"
"11308120","11309460"," There's some things we know."
"11310400","11313240"," We know that we've got sellers up here."
"11314080","11315280"," We know where they are. "
"11315700","11317160"," They're right there, right?"
"11317860","11319220"," You shall not pass."
"11319620","11320260"," Double top, bro."
"11321300","11323540"," That's the top for the whole entire year. "
"11324180","11325740"," You ain't never getting past this."
"11332450","11334830"," I'll tell you where the sellers are right now."
"11335590","11337010"," They're right fucking here. "
"11337670","11342230"," And if we break through them, you know we're trading, right?"
"11343570","11345170"," We're trading this right here."
"11346250","11348210"," Trading all this shit right here."
"11351590","11352650"," Something like that. "
"11352830","11355750"," Maybe have like a vault apocalypse or some shit Wednesday and Thursday."
"11359250","11360390"," Come deck down here."
"11360490","11362150"," See this JPM collar, maybe. "
"11364330","11367730"," And there's your like Friday rip faces off into the clothes."
"11371350","11372610"," So I don't know, man."
"11372850","11375390"," I got to tell you, man, right now we're trading this. "
"11377090","11378950"," This is what I want to trade to."
"11379210","11379630"," I'm a bull."
"11379810","11380910"," I want to, I'll be honest with you. "
"11380970","11381910"," I'm a fucking bull."
"11382050","11383150"," I want to go way down here."
"11384110","11385530"," We want to grab that shit. "
"11385750","11391010"," Maybe we can get a nice vault apocalypse into Wednesday and Thursday heading into fucking into the"
"11391010","11393350"," end of month and we'll tag this JPM collar, right?"
"11393510","11393610"," Right?"
"11393870","11394010"," Perfect."
"11395090","11396030"," They're right in there."
"11396490","11396850"," Right?"
"11397070","11398090"," Right from the 30th or something. "
"11398110","11399030"," We get that big squeeze."
"11400630","11403550"," But for right now, price action is dominating, right?"
"11403850","11404250"," What matters?"
"11404850","11407130"," JPM collar does not fucking matter, does it?"
"11407290","11409590"," Price action rules, no matter what."
"11409890","11411650"," So right here, right now, what's going on?"
"11412370","11413130"," Oh shit. "
"11415330","11415850"," Sellers."
"11418130","11419070"," Losing control."
"11422190","11423090"," Get up some pie. "
"11424170","11425930"," A bunch of crap up here needs to be solved."
"11426790","11428550"," We know the real sellers are up here, right?"
"11429030","11434750"," These are the, these are the guys that missed leg day and they're like, and we also have like crash"
"11434750","11436170"," bears, correction bears."
"11436530","11438370"," They're just like down, down, down. "
"11439130","11440430"," I want a correction right now."
"11443430","11444670"," Next window of weakness."
"11445090","11450350"," Remember we talked about the window of weakness between June, June, I said June 20th, excuse me, I"
"11450350","11452630"," said June 20th, June 23rd, you get a window of weakness. "
"11453550","11455310"," I said, limit your expectations to the downside."
"11460570","11462790"," So that's pretty good job, bears."
"11463010","11463570"," Good job, sellers. "
"11464610","11466550"," So this is their last chance, right?"
"11466830","11469190"," If I'm wrong, they will sell this right now."
"11469950","11471830"," So if I'm wrong, I will change my opinion."
"11471950","11473630"," You can say Captain Jim James is wrong. "
"11474130","11477090"," So you get your window of weakness, right?"
"11478050","11487990"," Today is the 22nd, 23rd, 21st, 20th window of weakness, BAM, 1, 2, 3."
"11489150","11490490"," You got one more day."
"11490610","11491430"," I'll give you one more day."
"11492570","11496130"," The options market at least was, was, was given you at least one more down day. "
"11496310","11497790"," Doesn't look like you're getting it right now."
"11497810","11504210"," You better, we better sell this stuff because these buyers in cash market are looking to rip your"
"11504210","11504790"," face off."
"11505390","11509010"," Even it comes, even if it comes back down in the overnight, they're looking to take this and clear"
"11509010","11510990"," out all this garbage up here. "
"11510990","11518990"," So either today right now into this close or tomorrow, expect a pretty significant upside move."
"11519890","11526690"," Saying that, you don't have a trade as a bull unless we get above that hourly trigger and confirm"
"11526690","11526910"," it."
"11527510","11533890"," Like you need the big old green bar, BAM, get that big old push, come back down. "
"11534630","11535530"," That'd be a red bar."
"11535910","11540270"," And then you get the boom green bars and you're like, whoo, we're closing all that shit up."
"11540990","11542770"," Yahoo baby into Friday. "
"11543750","11547410"," Now, where can the sellers re-enter this market?"
"11547410","11555290"," Their next try is going to be somewhere up here at 439, 47, 441, 03."
"11555730","11557110"," They could be lower at this point."
"11557690","11559650"," They could revenge to trade this and all that. "
"11559910","11563730"," And then into next week, I'm going to expect, have some expectation."
"11564690","11568670"," I do have an expectation to hear that because this vol is gone unless you get some kind of bullshit"
"11568670","11571950"," news tomorrow on that PCE."
"11572210","11573570"," My expectation isn't a Friday. "
"11574370","11575710"," We're going to try to take that shit out."
"11575950","11583250"," And then we'll probably trade a sideways range and down into I believe Thursday, or Wednesday,"
"11583590","11583850"," Thursday."
"11584770","11588790"," And then Friday, we'll get the end of that end of month flows and we'll get some kind of a"
"11588790","11596350"," relief rally up into the close and maybe go back to attack real all-time eyes on to the 5th"
"11596350","11596750"," of July. "
"11597770","11599630"," But right now, not looking good for sellers."
"11600450","11603530"," You ain't got shit to say, man, if you're a seller, what else you got coming up?"
"11603770","11605730"," What are they talking about on a twin to it?"
"11606610","11610890"," I want to know what they think they have here because I didn't hear shit today that was a bearish."
"11611090","11616070"," If I was a fucking bear, I'd be like, all you want to hear Jerome say is, we're not going"
"11616070","11616990"," to raise rates anymore. "
"11616990","11623170"," There'll probably be a big liquidity grab like, probably be a giant liquidity grab like, and then"
"11623170","11626230"," bloodbath down to $3,500 or something."
"11627950","11632410"," Like 45 minutes of straight up and then a fucking violent move down."
"11633550","11638170"," Remember too, people are out there saying, people are comparing this. "
"11638950","11641030"," Let's look at a big old chart on SPX."
"11642070","11643670"," I saw them out there yesterday."
"11644770","11649330"," They were comparing like this shit like, I saw them out there yesterday. "
"11649610","11653010"," They were like, yo, dog, remember that down there?"
"11653190","11654030"," Remember that down there?"
"11654130","11654730"," Remember that down there?"
"11654930","11655830"," We're going to do that right now."
"11656010","11656830"," I saw that shit."
"11657290","11657910"," I saw it. "
"11658210","11661070"," And right now, it ain't looking good for you."
"11661330","11662850"," It's looking like that, baby."
"11665050","11667270"," So we'll see. "
"11667670","11671370"," You're on the cusp bulls and you're on the cusp bears."
"11672590","11673190"," Look at that."
"11673350","11677810"," They don't even want to give up trend on a daily trend on a 6 EMA. "
"11678490","11680250"," They don't even want to give it up to you."
"11680410","11681090"," Look at me."
"11681170","11681490"," I'm a bull. "
"11681670","11684670"," I'm like, come on, just come back down to give me like, 427."
"11685830","11688770"," I'm like, just come down here so I can get, I can buy a dip in safety."
"11689650","11691150"," I want to put some size on down here. "
"11691570","11692990"," I want that next leg up there."
"11693570","11695550"," These fucking bulls are like, get fucked, buddy."
"11695650","11696330"," We're going up here. "
"11697170","11699810"," So hopefully you can get some downside maybe in the month."
"11700610","11703050"," Maybe July 15th or something."
"11703290","11704310"," We can come back down here. "
"11706610","11708270"," I don't know mid July."
"11711410","11714030"," We can get a week or two of window weakness."
"11715930","11721650"," Like July 15th to July 15th, maybe you're losing it right now, sellers. "
"11725310","11727130"," Play a little ping pong in here."
"11729110","11733670"," Let this come up here and meet the fucking, the fucking buyers so they can take this for the next"
"11733670","11735050"," leg to the moon."
"11737870","11740950"," This still also means they can't put size on the market. "
"11741130","11741910"," That's the crazy part."
"11743330","11747330"," Look, you need, you guys need like, sellers need like JPM on their side."
"11747950","11748870"," They need something. "
"11749350","11751750"," They need like, they need something bad to happen."
"11754810","11756710"," Sellers need like really, oh, here we go."
"11757230","11758970"," Here goes the, here goes the bears. "
"11760930","11763590"," They're like, why are you selling just because?"
"11765510","11766270"," Look at them."
"11766750","11767410"," They're terrible."
"11767630","11768510"," They just want to sell, dude. "
"11768690","11769810"," Like sell, sell, sell."
"11770510","11771450"," We need a market crash."
"11772610","11773310"," Full party over. "
"11774470","11776710"," Look at them, so stupid to watch."
"11778950","11780170"," Like they need a reason."
"11780330","11781570"," I don't know if they have a reason, man. "
"11781710","11783230"," I don't see anything out there."
"11783770","11787270"," Give it like outside of like outside of like auto."
"11787310","11789310"," Let's just bring it down so we can go higher. "
"11789530","11796950"," I don't see any fucking reason out there for for sellers to be like market crash."
"11797230","11798710"," I don't say I don't see anything."
"11799250","11799470"," Nothing. "
"11801610","11806190"," Nothing structural right now for selling this market."
"11806410","11809190"," Other than we need a better price, let's cool the shit off."
"11809930","11811730"," So I don't know. "
"11812250","11814930"," If you're a seller out there, give me a dip to buy, man."
"11815530","11817010"," Get me down to fucking 427."
"11818490","11820290"," Get me down to a 412. "
"11820890","11821210"," Give me that."
"11821370","11821970"," Now, give me that today."
"11822150","11822890"," I want it right now. "
"11823150","11829130"," Anything you can do to get me down to 427, 412 so that I can fucking go big."
"11830870","11833310"," Like anything, anything you got, give it to me."
"11833570","11836450"," Otherwise, open pray, man. "
"11837370","11838830"," We need some bullshit news."
"11839290","11842110"," We need like some like we need JPOT to just threaten or something."
"11842350","11842750"," I don't know. "
"11843910","11845710"," We need something, something bad."
"11850670","11852070"," Yeah, I don't know, man."
"11852230","11853610"," I'm trying to think of some reason. "
"11854310","11855230"," We need something."

"11871570","11873170"," See a big fucking shark underneath."
"11874030","11876190"," And all it's doing is saying, fine, stay there. "

"11899070","11905160"," Yeah, I'm telling you, man."
"11906040","11908080"," There's going to be some buying tomorrow, too, right?"
"11908240","11908620"," We know that. "
"11908760","11910560"," We know that we know that we don't get it right now."
"11910620","11913980"," If they pin this into the clothes, it's going to rip some faces off."
"11914320","11917780"," So I don't know what's all else to say to you on this. "
"11918140","11920260"," It's not, it's hard here for a seller."
"11924000","11924960"," It's a hard place."
"11925220","11926340"," You're going to get trapped in this. "
"11926500","11927140"," I guarantee it."
"11929140","11930720"," Guarantee at some point, you're going to get trapped."
"11931360","11931740"," You're a seller. "
"11933320","11934600"," Now you've got the clock ticking."
"11935120","11936140"," Time was on your side."
"11936600","11937560"," Clock is now against you. "
"11941630","11943150"," And we need something."
"11943290","11943970"," I'll be honest with you."
"11944130","11945310"," Like 100% honest. "
"11946330","11949710"," I fucking want a gorgeous dip to buy."
"11950010","11952170"," I want to buy that fucking yellow line so bad."
"11952970","11954210"," That orange line. "
"11954310","11955250"," I want to buy that orange line."
"11955830","11957950"," Because I love that."
"11958170","11961330"," That buy is fucking money, man. "
"11961830","11962970"," It is fucking money."
"11963850","11965770"," So I'll do anything to get that buy."
"11966010","11967710"," But you know, I'm not in charge of that. "
"11967790","11968790"," You're not in charge of that."
"11971010","11971790"," We're just not."
"11972150","11973370"," We're not in charge of that stuff. "
"11973530","11979230"," So if they can mechanically draw us down in the nighttime, right?"
"11979930","11981410"," That's the only way that I'm seeing it."
"11981730","11983390"," I was trying to measure the down move."
"11983390","11985510"," And I'm like, this is all fucking nighttime stuff. "
"11985510","11990130"," Like I can't even get the shit down in the daytime, which just recovers, recovers, recovers."
"11992710","11995410"," So the only thing I can say to this would be pin it into the clothes."
"11995750","11997430"," Maybe you get some more downside in here. "
"11998810","12001650"," And then that relief rally during the day on Friday possible."
"12003430","12004730"," That's all I can think about."
"12007010","12008410"," But it's not bearish. "
"12008570","12010190"," You guys know what bearish looks like, right?"
"12010910","12016070"," Bearish is like, we're selling fucking cash like crazy real money selling by large institutions."
"12017130","12021810"," And that's what you fucking sell button."
"12022410","12024890"," The largest portion of this market. "
"12025510","12027290"," So we just start selling hard and heavy."
"12033150","12036830"," You know, a little bit of that with like a salad bowl, right?"
"12036990","12039430"," You get a little bit of that real money selling."
"12040090","12043690"," You get a little bit of action from hedge funds at the close and at the open. "
"12044350","12049050"," And then you get a sauce that you can make for some significant downside moves."
"12049570","12051410"," You can just run over the fucking retailers."
"12052410","12053890"," Fucking you make the dailers chase. "
"12054270","12055570"," You get an amplified move down."
"12056190","12057510"," And it's a beautiful fucking thing."
"12057790","12059410"," So I just haven't seen it yet. "
"12059450","12061310"," If it happens, fucking do it, man."
"12061390","12061670"," I'm down."
"12062770","12064170"," I want you to do it every month. "
"12064390","12067390"," Every month I want you to do it and every three months I want you to do it so I"
"12067390","12071570"," can take a fucking long for this, for this, whatever this market's going to be for the rest of the"
"12071570","12071730"," year."
"12073890","12078390"," Yeah, this is their last chance, man."
"12078550","12081890"," This is like a do or die for bears like this whole area here. "
"12082650","12085870"," This whole thing right here is their last chance and the clock is ticking."
"12085870","12086890"," They know a lot of time here."
"12086890","12089990"," So they got to do it. "
"12092150","12095090"," Like need a reason to sell even if they manufacture."
"12095530","12095850"," I don't care."
"12096030","12099010"," Like you got to have like a reason or if it's mechanical selling. "
"12099990","12100930"," That's fine too."
"12101130","12102970"," Like no even go with no reason."
"12103110","12104690"," You just sell and make up some bullshit excuse. "
"12108950","12113110"," Because if they don't, right, if we get above this hourly trigger at any fucking point, I promise"
"12113110","12114250"," you we get above this hourly trigger."
"12114830","12116430"," That shit is on like Donkey Kong."

"14857570","14861630"," We'll start looking at higher time frames here and just look at what that's looking to close."

"14950750","14953110"," So this is a three trigger bull cluster right here."
"14953650","14956270"," One minute, five minute, one hour trigger. "
"14956950","14958910"," You got the initial impulse move up."
"14959270","14959270"," Boom."
"14960870","14961310"," Consolidation. "
"14961550","14965610"," If this thing starts to run to the upside, it's going to go up here and close all this shit"
"14965610","14966230"," up up here."
"14967030","14969730"," And it's looking to close some major highs above."
"14969970","14970610"," It's looking to close. "
"14971950","14973050"," What is it looking to close?"
"14974190","14977910"," 41, 82, 42, 46."
"14978990","14984330"," And try to even get close out of bunch of stuff going back in time."
"14984510","14986690"," Let me take a peek on a higher time frame here. "
"14989710","14991010"," Oh yeah, baby."
"14991290","14993790"," This shit's got a lot of room to run here."
"14994530","14997190"," This shit's got a lot of stuff to close out. "
"14997530","15001710"," It's got to close out 43, 73, 49 and change."
"15001910","15003210"," Looking for 50 bucks, basically."
"15004550","15006090"," And then we've got higher. "
"15006350","15009150"," Dude, if you get to $50, then we're looking for 61."
"15010530","15011870"," Then we're looking for 77."
"15012910","15015070"," And then we're looking for like 100 bucks. "
"15015890","15020010"," So this one's primed and ready to go to the upside right here."
"15020450","15021390"," Take a piece mail."
"15021830","15022970"," You got to targets up here. "
"15023290","15024050"," You got to go up here."
"15025210","15027630"," As long as it stays up here, it's very bullish right now."
"15028770","15030870"," So BRZE. "
"15031850","15034430"," We'll take a quick look back at the spoons and see what it's doing."
"15035130","15037670"," And spoons is getting all spun up to go to the upside."
"15039070","15040770"," We'll take a look at another one for you. "
"15041130","15045150"," We just did BRZE, ALGM, GTLB, PCOR."
"15046310","15047610"," We've got some more for you."
"15048470","15050370"," We'll take a look at Unity next. "
"15050370","15058420"," Kind of looking like garbage down here, right?"
"15058560","15059480"," It doesn't look good at all."
"15059600","15061160"," We'll find out why that is right now."
"15063160","15065240"," So you've got, hold on a second here, Unity. "
"15065680","15068580"," A bunch of Unity crowd out there is like, man, we're going to crash."
"15070520","15071700"," Almost guaranteed, right?"
"15071920","15072460"," That's what they're saying."
"15074920","15075640"," Hold on here. "
"15082210","15082950"," Hold on here."
"15084330","15085750"," Get some weirdness going on."
"15087770","15089950"," Getting some wonkiness going on in the background here. "
"15091130","15093430"," I bet you're thinking like, Unity's about to crash."
"15094050","15094630"," That's what I'd be thinking."
"15094630","15095290"," Look at that shit. "
"15096010","15097250"," You're like getting done going down."
"15102930","15104030"," Give me a second here."
"15105710","15106730"," Pretty much all right. "
"15118090","15122830"," Yeah, you know, I'm not, I'm not particularly happy with Unity right here."
"15122910","15123930"," This is what I'll say to you on Unity."
"15125670","15126070"," 3862. "
"15126590","15127190"," Keep an eye on it."
"15127970","15137950"," If it 3862, like right now"
"15137950","15140770"," on a five minute chart, it looks bearish here."
"15140870","15141630"," It's got the bear cross. "
"15142970","15144550"," I'll draw this on though."
"15144930","15145530"," Keep an eye on it."
"15145690","15156340"," Maybe make yourself a, I know it looks, I know it seems like it's like it's bearish"
"15156340","15157340"," here, but I don't think that it is. "
"15157340","15159640"," So the first target there is 39."
"15160000","15163960"," If you can get above this here, this 38 bucks, your first target is 3971."
"15164760","15168120"," And in all actuality, you're looking for some bigger numbers here. "
"15169540","15169980"," 4372."
"15170700","15173740"," Keep your eye on this one because this one could reverse here."
"15174460","15179280"," The stuff in the background saying, keep an eye on it, that it could be going up, could be primed,"
"15179600","15180240"," ready to go to the upside. "
"15181620","15183420"," Yeah, yeah, definitely it is."
"15183900","15185620"," So just watch this one right here."
"15185680","15190360"," You can't take this trade unless you get above the screen box right here, but keep an eye on it. "
"15191200","15191760"," That's unity."
"15192740","15194620"," It's saying, it's telling me it's going up."
"15197660","15198100"," IOT. "
"15201260","15201920"," Sam, sorry."
"15202100","15202160"," Yep."
"15202520","15202920"," That's the one. "
"15203160","15204380"," Oh, look at that beautiful thing."
"15204740","15210680"," You got yourselves at gorgeous five minute bull cross right here from the open this morning."
"15211020","15211780"," It's been trending up. "
"15212260","15213300"," Come back down to test."
"15213500","15218400"," It's one minute and it's a, excuse me, a five minute 27 EMA and the 129 EMA right now."
"15218760","15221000"," As long as it stays above here, it's going to keep going higher. "
"15221620","15222980"," So we've got IOT."
"15223820","15226100"," Let me take a look in the background and see if it's saying anything."
"15226400","15228560"," Any magical dust back there and try. "
"15228660","15229120"," Oh, yeah."
"15229440","15230120"," Look at that, baby."
"15230500","15233260"," Oh, baby 2773. "
"15233520","15237020"," As long as it stays above that number, it's going higher 2773."
"15237360","15238300"," So right here, boom."
"15238900","15243900"," As long as we stay above right here, even if this is consolidating, as long as we stay above this"
"15243900","15248940"," 2773, expect some more face rippers to the upside on this one right here. "
"15249120","15252900"," So that's what your number is right there, 2774, 2773."
"15255800","15257880"," Let's go back and look at Spy real quick."
"15258700","15259720"," Where's the spoons?"
"15260600","15262020"," Oh, what's it doing, dude?"
"15262700","15263240"," What's it doing?"
"15263680","15264340"," Is it wanting to go?"
"15265100","15267040"," A lot of shit in the market saying it wants to go. "
"15267040","15272040"," A lot of underlying stuff saying a lot of a lot of risk on stuff is saying we're going to"
"15272040","15272320"," the upside."
"15272680","15278360"," So spoons telling you no, but some risk on shit, some speculative growth is saying we're going up."
"15278840","15281640"," So we got IOT just did that one for you. "
"15282020","15283280"," Let's go to the next one."
"15284840","15290780"," And we got we got IOT CRDO is the next one CRDO."
"15292620","15294120"," Oh, this one's looking ugly, right?"
"15294360","15297620"," Five minutes, that is like classic distribution pattern, right?"
"15297980","15298480"," Look at that. "
"15298540","15299580"," Oh, man, this one's going to crash."
"15299800","15302440"," So we just look at that like crass classic distribution pattern."
"15303240","15304360"," Let's bring it on down. "
"15304540","15308640"," Let's get some selling on CRDO, right?"
"15309180","15310900"," Doom on CRDO."
"15311960","15314460"," Let's take a look at it and see if it's actually doom or not."
"15316860","15317960"," Yeah, kind of. "
"15318060","15318560"," Well, it is."
"15318640","15319180"," It isn't."
"15319400","15322080"," You've got a daily trigger down below it, 1504. "
"15323280","15326380"," So right down here, you got you got a shark coming up."
"15327120","15329260"," It's kind of way down here, 1504."
"15330400","15334480"," And you're not trading above your your hourly. "
"15334780","15335640"," So I will say this."
"15335840","15336640"," Oh, close that up."
"15336740","15337680"," This one might be bearish. "
"15338400","15340660"," So this one might be for south side for the bears."
"15341660","15342560"," What do we got here?"
"15343980","15344420"," 1810."
"15345600","15351740"," As long as price stays below 1810, we could get a move to the downside here. "
"15353260","15355120"," Preferably, I would like to buy it down here."
"15355760","15356840"," That would be my preference."
"15356960","15359600"," Then ping pong this and then I move higher. "
"15360260","15369720"," Now, with that said, if price at any point gets above this $18.10, a"
"15369720","15370860"," little bit higher there."
"15374370","15376450"," Price gets above right here at any point."
"15377530","15384310"," It's going to do a big giant move to the upside and start to continue. "
"15384970","15386370"," I know you may be bearish here."
"15386410","15388270"," I can see that you probably like that one cap."
"15388290","15390330"," We're going to sell that one to the moon or to the depths of hell. "
"15390830","15392030"," We're going to get you a better price cap."
"15392130","15395350"," Just be careful because this thing is like said that in the past."
"15395350","15396450"," And then it comes down here. "
"15396510","15398290"," It's like boom, bought it, boom, bought it."
"15398690","15399750"," And it's like boom, boom."
"15400110","15402490"," And then boom, we're going up here and ripping some faces off. "
"15403150","15404110"," Just be careful on this one."
"15404190","15405890"," If you're if you're bearish, CRDO."
"15407430","15408610"," Keep your eye on that one. "
"15408890","15410130"," CRDO for the upside move."
"15411290","15413730"," Stock screen is a bullish stock screen or not a bearish one."
"15414750","15416830"," So fi, what's so fi doing?"
"15417290","15418610"," Everybody likes so fi, right?"
"15420030","15422650"," So fi looks bearish as fuck to doesn't it?"
"15422770","15423490"," Like just look at it. "
"15424030","15425170"," That's the top cap."
"15425490","15426510"," We're going, that's the top."
"15426710","15427150"," We're going down. "
"15427310","15433450"," This is your first leg down then bloodbath to the downside on on so fi that's all so fi bulls"
"15433450","15435370"," are out there peeing the pants all scared."
"15436790","15439130"," So so fi crowds like no cap, no cap."
"15439150","15439830"," Don't do that one. "
"15439950","15440710"," I want cheaper prices."
"15440710","15441890"," And I'm like, yeah, I get that."
"15442550","15444330"," So fi crowd wants to buy. "
"15444570","15447030"," They want to buy 123."
"15448150","15450930"," Maybe eight bucks down here right down here."
"15450930","15453830"," They want to buy eight bucks, but saying that. "
"15454810","15457170"," So maybe a double bottom, right?"
"15457850","15460770"," Slam down, slam down, and then we're off and running believe it or not."
"15461230","15464890"," Now saying that not shockingly."
"15466250","15470710"," So fi is parked right on it's hourly trigger right now. "
"15471590","15478530"," So though we can go down here and catch these literally sitting on it's hourly trigger right now."
"15479530","15484190"," And if it holds this the market starts to go up, this is going to be a trap for bears."
"15485330","15493870"," We will look for a move to the do I have an edge here?"
"15493970","15495010"," Do I can I sell this down?"
"15495770","15496030"," Right?"
"15496290","15499010"," And you get like all these bears come out like we're selling the fuck out of this. "
"15499030","15501190"," And then we get like, whoa, what's wrong?"
"15501650","15501670"," Boom."
"15502450","15505150"," And then we just start going up there and cleaning some shit out up there."
"15506150","15508410"," You just clean some of them bad bears out over there. "
"15508930","15514330"," That looks like this does not look good, but market starts to go higher."
"15514330","15516550"," So fi falls along, whatever you do."
"15517270","15521610"," If this breaks, if we get anything like this down here. "
"15522490","15530690"," If you any kind of like blood down here, and then we go like this, you will end up getting"
"15530690","15532150"," down some downside movement."
"15536580","15537700"," Oh, missing some."
"15539340","15541380"," So right there. "
"15542120","15543300"," Thank you, Winky for the update, brother."
"15544060","15545240"," So so fi."
"15545800","15552900"," Next one we're going to look at is sound SU any or SU and excuse me. "
"15554060","15556200"," And the SU and is sound hound."
"15556380","15557180"," There they go right there."
"15558780","15559440"," Look at them. "
"15559540","15560720"," They pumped all morning, right?"
"15560920","15562260"," Called this one out earlier this morning."
"15562540","15565420"," Rip faces all day long, slamming up here, right?"
"15565660","15568140"," Come back to check their one minute as long as they stay above 419."
"15568720","15569500"," There's not over yet. "
"15569640","15574560"," I think they're done for the day, but they are still alive as long as they trade above 419."
"15575180","15578580"," Let me take a look at them in the background and see if they win."
"15579360","15580600"," They might be done for the day. "
"15580700","15580920"," Let me look."
"15581120","15581280"," Nope."
"15581580","15583240"," They're not done 392. "
"15584260","15585200"," So 392."
"15585780","15587800"," I prefer I would prefer another pullback."
"15588440","15589540"," Like let it breathe. "
"15590360","15591620"," Come down here, maybe."
"15592880","15595440"," I prefer I prefer like a breather down here."
"15595440","15599700"," Like just come on down here, come down here to a check, scare everybody and then bam, they're off"
"15599700","15600320"," again and running. "
"15600900","15603720"," Just keep your eyes on sound for another dip buy."
"15604000","15607580"," If it stays above 419, it's just going to keep fucking ripping."
"15607580","15608260"," It's not done. "
"15608700","15611440"," It's got a whole bunch of shit to close out on the ops on the upside."
"15611960","15614060"," This ticker has not stopped just so you know."
"15614540","15615420"," It started at $2. "
"15615780","15620700"," We called it out at $2.50. It is not fucking stopped, but nonstop."
"15620880","15622220"," It's at 423 right now."
"15622220","15623780"," It's looking to trade 523. "
"15624960","15627940"," And it's got way more highs to go in the background here."
"15628500","15632460"," Once that when it's over five bucks, it's going to try to trade $8."
"15633120","15634680"," So S-O-U-N. "
"15635240","15636620"," It's going to try to trade $8."
"15637260","15639000"," Then we're going to look at SMRT."
"15639620","15643720"," SMRT ran all day long. "
"15644620","15645680"," Talked about this one."
"15645940","15646300"," Boring market."
"15646740","15647100"," Fuck no. "
"15647780","15648660"," Not for SMRT."
"15649100","15650840"," Just ripped faces all day long."
"15651040","15651420"," Never stopped. "
"15652400","15653280"," Just kept on going."
"15653660","15655840"," SMRT called that one up this morning."
"15656640","15659840"," It's 1.5% or 1.57% the day. "
"15660700","15662500"," Let's take a look at that one in the background."
"15662820","15663260"," SMRT."
"15663460","15663880"," Boring market. "
"15665400","15666580"," I'll get another one here."
"15666920","15667400"," Let's see here."
"15667520","15668100"," Come on down here. "
"15668160","15668900"," See what this one's doing."
"15669120","15669380"," Let's look."
"15669620","15670940"," Oh yeah, baby. "
"15671580","15672100"," This one."
"15672580","15673740"," Ready to go to the fucking moon."
"15674960","15675240"," Right?"
"15675380","15675820"," SMRT. "
"15676180","15678440"," SMRT is sitting on two triggers right now."
"15678460","15678640"," You ready?"
"15679140","15680500"," You want to see an explosive move?"
"15681140","15682140"," I got one for you."

"21032230","21033230"," I don't see it."
"21033730","21036570"," I might have to like stop the stream and start it again."

"21081510","21086090"," You know, we could do is just say fucking play some music and we'll just lose the money for today. "
"21087390","21088270"," Should we do that?"
"21088570","21089110"," Let me see here."

"21094030","21095210"," I better have to restart everything. "
"21098070","21103490"," Maybe I'll just play some jams here and get pinged from the gods."
"21106670","21107670"," Hold on here."

"21141070","21142050"," I can streamlabs, man."
"21142150","21143670"," I fucking need some streamlabs sometimes."
"21146190","21147090"," Where am I looking for?"
"21147690","21148830"," No, no, I don't want that. "
"21153790","21161240"," No, no, no, no, no."

"21188690","21188890"," I'm back."
"21190010","21190790"," Okay, I'm good."
"21191690","21194130"," I almost lost us there. "
"21195630","21196150"," Hold on."
"21196270","21197290"," I'm gonna try to put the music up."
"21200370","21201330"," I got there. "
"21203930","21207740"," I don't know what this is right here."
"21211920","21214000"," I'm gonna try to find this fucking music."
"21217900","21218780"," Yeah, there. "
"21220360","21220780"," Open."
"21227210","21229790"," I don't know what I'm doing here."
"21237350","21238610"," I can't see shit. "
"21239310","21240250"," It's like a black screen."
"21240350","21244570"," I got a black screen in front of me like, and then I don't see anything on streamlabs right now."
"21246650","21247430"," Where we go back?"
"21253300","21254060"," Studio mode. "
"21256100","21257220"," Nope, not studio mode."
"21258740","21259640"," Not seen either."
"21265860","21267460"," How did I just go back there a minute ago?"
"21268960","21270760"," Are you guys all scared in here?"
"21270880","21272640"," I can see the chart here right now. "
"21272740","21274060"," Are you guys scared of where we are right now?"
"21274080","21274520"," You all panicky?"
"21276340","21277120"," I'm not panicky."
"21280260","21281520"," Dude, what is going on here?"
"21291850","21293070"," Are you guys all scared?"
"21293210","21294370"," Are you guys all in full panic mode?"
"21294550","21295210"," I know how this goes."
"21296650","21301210"," We start with you panicking, and then we end up with you wanting to buy calls when we're at the"
"21301210","21301470"," top. "
"21302730","21303950"," I know how this goes."
"21309820","21310540"," It's dashboard."
"21312120","21312680"," Highlighter created. "
"21312920","21314500"," What the fuck am I supposed to be on here?"
"21321790","21322990"," I don't know what I'm doing here."
"21329250","21330730"," I'm going to start at the top and click mall."
"21332650","21333310"," There we go. "
"21334650","21335570"," Okay, I can see again."
"21336150","21337490"," So you guys panicking right here."
"21337510","21338310"," You guys are all like worried. "
"21338970","21340110"," You're all worried wall arses."
"21341610","21343750"," Are they getting the scare on you?"
"21343890","21344390"," This is the role."
"21344870","21345550"," Is that what they're telling you?"
"21345650","21346070"," This is the role. "
"21347330","21348350"," More crash to come."
"21351110","21352970"," Is this the doom trade right here?"
"21353790","21356810"," The crash trade like that."
"21356990","21358850"," Is that the fear trade right there?"
"21359770","21360410"," I'm on calls. "
"21360650","21364490"," I'm on calls into tomorrow, and I'm on calls for a gap up overnight."
"21366290","21368530"," And I don't believe any of this right now."
"21372910","21374750"," No faith in this right here. "
"21376070","21376590"," Zero."
"21377750","21379850"," Three trigger, pull cluster, initiated."
"21381130","21381530"," We're going up. "
"21382270","21384370"," Now I guess I could get bearish here."
"21385290","21388050"," If we had a close below the cluster, I would."
"21388510","21395290"," If price was below the hourly, I would reverse my decision and go with puts on tomorrow. "
"21396210","21398250"," But we're above it right now, so we're good."
"21403710","21406070"," I guess that would be the only way that I would get bearish here."
"21406850","21408090"," I guess I could get bearish here. "
"21408330","21409190"," Yeah, I wouldn't rule it out."
"21410330","21412570"," I wouldn't rule it out."
"21415130","21417170"," Let me make sure I got the exact target here. "
"21419550","21420550"," 435 61."
"21420910","21421370"," It's right here."
"21422230","21436880"," It's right there. "
"21436880","21438500"," What did you do?"
"21445720","21451280"," I wouldn't rule it out if it was like bloodbath down here and then some rejection."
"21452100","21454960"," Probably take a little short there, but I know what this is."
"21455540","21468830"," I wish I"
"21468830","21474230"," could show this to you the green, like when the green is going down, and when the green is going"
"21474230","21478410"," sideways, and when the green is coming back up, and what that actually means. "
"21478690","21479670"," So that's what you are right now."
"21480210","21482250"," In the initial, oh wait a minute, you guys can't see that."
"21484590","21490390"," So you're not seeing here is we had like the green bar was like coming down, and the green bar"
"21490390","21495490"," went sideways, the price came up, jumped above it, and now the green bar is coming up right here. "
"21496750","21497630"," So it's like right here."
"21497810","21500330"," Wham, and then wham to the upside."
"21501930","21504690"," And this green thing, this green thing determines trend. "
"21506030","21508630"," And so you see the flattening when you see the flattening."
"21508930","21513970"," It's telling you that this is the bottom and then you can wait for that confirmation for the turn"
"21513970","21514530"," to the upside."
"21520000","21523180"," Okay, I'll show it to you guys one more time here, so you can see it. "
"21523820","21526820"," And as a matter of fact, you can see it right now."
"21526860","21527580"," See this right here?"
"21528440","21532480"," This is support right here for the spoons."
"21533180","21536700"," See that right there?"
"21537560","21538920"," There's your support right here for the spoons. "
"21539640","21541060"," That's your hourly trigger right there."
"21543980","21546760"," And I'm going to show it to you here in another way to show it to you."
"21557370","21558510"," This is a 30 minute chart. "
"21558710","21561690"," So you guys are watching a we like one minute chart, five minute chart or something like that."
"21562610","21564070"," I'm going to show you a 30 minute chart."
"21564910","21566010"," I'm going to see what happens. "
"21568970","21570730"," You have that downside move right?"
"21571490","21574410"," They're like panicking, you know the panicking, you know the panicking, you know the panicking, you"
"21574410","21574990"," break above."
"21575570","21576590"," See that flattening there?"
"21578010","21580870"," You see that down move right there, then the flatten right?"
"21581330","21585010"," Every time you see that flattening like that, you start to get fearful, right?"
"21585010","21587870"," You're like bloodbath, bloodbath, bloodbath, and you see the flattening."
"21588050","21589870"," You see the green is flattening right there. "
"21590730","21596030"," And what you're seeing here is a trend to the flattening right there."
"21596670","21598210"," I want you to show you the flattening right here."
"21598310","21599890"," You see the flattening that's taking place right here?"
"21600830","21601830"," And price is now above. "
"21602750","21605710"," So just right here, price now above."
"21605930","21607310"," This is going to start to push up higher."
"21608470","21610490"," You get that confirmation trade to the upside. "
"21611430","21613190"," And we'll keep on moving to the upside."
"21614010","21620390"," Now, let's say we were testing this and the green line was down here."
"21621990","21624290"," And let's pretend this none of this was here. "
"21625070","21626250"," Give it all that there."
"21630830","21632130"," Tending none of that was there."
"21634830","21636690"," And the green bar was still heading down. "
"21640990","21641470"," Shit."
"21648130","21650110"," And you got the red bars here, right?"
"21651310","21655550"," You'd expect that more continuation down for spoons."
"21657270","21660890"," But when you're getting it here, the flattening is happening, right?"
"21661070","21671050"," This gives you the force sight that we're"
"21671050","21673890"," coming into a bottom when the green is flattening here. "
"21674650","21677850"," And the other thing that's showing you is one more thing down here."
"21678850","21682110"," Which is velocity when velocity is down like this, right?"
"21682810","21687930"," It's looking to make this move to the zero line and then move up, right?"
"21688110","21688870"," For that push higher."
"21689790","21691610"," Now, daily is kind of shitty here. "
"21692350","21694710"," So that's why I'm wondering about into the end of month."
"21694930","21698110"," We get that pullback down to the 432 for the SPX."
"21699650","21700910"," 6 million to the buy side. "
"21701290","21702430"," We're trying to sell it right now."
"21702470","21702970"," Look at them."
"21703130","21704530"," They're like revenge trading this. "
"21706170","21707410"," Look at how angry they are."
"21708810","21710450"," Like full anger into this close."
"21711470","21713530"," Rage right now on this close. "
"21713990","21715570"," On this close right now, they're pissed off."
"21716250","21717190"," But I'm still long and smart."
"21717390","21718710"," I don't believe these sellers right now at all. "
"21718830","21719850"," I've got no faith in these sellers."
"21721550","21723010"," Zero faith in these sellers."
"21725630","21726490"," Pissed off sellers. "
"21727550","21730230"," But this flattening right here is telling you the different story."
"21731450","21734930"," And this flattening is different than this one right here with the downside."
"21735090","21736870"," You've got this flattening right here. "
"21737490","21739410"," So I'm not buying any of these sellers right now."
"21739590","21741110"," I don't believe anything that they're saying to you."
"21741450","21742930"," Probably freaking you out right now. "
"21743550","21745170"," And I've got no faith in them."
"21745470","21745890"," So here we go."
"21745890","21746630"," Look at NDX. "
"21746750","21747870"," We'll look at Q's really quick."
"21748430","21749530"," See if it's the same thing."
"21751210","21752850"," You're seeing the same thing right here. "
"21753570","21754810"," The turn's already been made."
"21755790","21758810"," You see the turn right here on the Q's to the upside."
"21759590","21763190"," And so they're trying to panic sell you into the Q's as well. "
"21763190","21764530"," And the Q's are just fine."
"21764690","21765250"," They're going up."
"21765930","21768230"," And you've already seen the turns been made on the Q's. "
"21768470","21771110"," So you're probably panicking right now on SPY."
"21771370","21772510"," Just not going to happen."
"21773190","21774450"," Let's take a look at IWM. "
"21775950","21778090"," The same thing happening right here right."
"21778490","21779490"," Not quite there yet."
"21780130","21781770"," Not quite there for spoons. "
"21781930","21784130"," But look at IWM coming from down below right here."
"21784590","21786690"," So you're probably panicking on IWM as well."
"21787050","21789050"," And it hasn't become bullshit. "
"21789710","21792990"," But it's going to turn at some point on Friday and start moving higher."
"21793290","21794450"," You're going to get one more day in here."
"21795070","21797330"," And you're going to get that explosive move on IWM. "
"21798010","21799190"," So don't be believing these bears."
"21799850","21801870"," We believe in these sellers telling you that we're going down."
"21802610","21805330"," I don't believe any of this that they're doing right now. "
"21805990","21806470"," None of it."
"21806690","21807630"," It's all scam right here."
"21810550","21811590"," Don't be believing it. "
"21813710","21815190"," Do not believe them."
"21817910","21819330"," Or at least I don't believe them."
"21821830","21823650"," Now anything they're doing here. "
"21824790","21825670"," They're going to try."
"21825890","21827630"," And I'm telling you right now they're fucking wrong."
"21830690","21831490"," They're trying. "
"21833070","21835510"," They're revenge trading all they want to revenge trade."
"21835730","21837350"," They can revenge trade this all they want."
"21837930","21840010"," This price means nothing to me tomorrow. "
"21840990","21844970"," They're going to what they want to do is they want us try to sell SPY into this bell so"
"21844970","21849710"," they can get some help to the downside for for dealers trying to sell futures."
"21849710","21855790"," But I'm looking at I'm looking at cues right now and cues are looking just fine to the upside."
"21858130","21861490"," I'm not believing it in any way shape or form. "
"21862230","21863270"," This is a bear trap."
"21868850","21871070"," Yeah, I can look at a BTC if you want me to."
"21871810","21871970"," One second. "
"21875010","21877250"," BTC on its hourly right now."
"21877430","21878450"," It's still sitting on it."
"21878450","21882030"," I've got a dip by on it or excuse me one second here. "
"21887310","21896870"," Yeah, so BTC had a dip by on 2983 and that's saying the same thing."
"21896950","21898130"," I'll show you a BTC right now."
"21899170","21903090"," Yeah, there's a little bit of Bitcoin has a little bit of weakness to it. "
"21904210","21905590"," Let's take a Bitcoin really quick."
"21905830","21907050"," Bitcoin might have a trap on it."
"21907190","21908530"," Be careful on Bitcoin right now. "
"21909670","21915110"," It looks like it wants to explode to the upside, but I never like seeing the hourly rolling like"
"21915110","21915310"," this."
"21916170","21917930"," So Bitcoin could have a trap."
"21921910","21923950"," Let me look on Bitcoin real quick. "
"21926210","21929830"," Or it just stays fucking I'll say two things about Bitcoin."
"21930210","21931570"," It can stay a rational longer."
"21932550","21934530"," We can get more green bars up here. "
"21934930","21936570"," I'm bullish on Bitcoin right where we are."
"21940190","21949910"," As long as we stay above 2909, I'm bullish here on Bitcoin, but it's if we"
"21949910","21955570"," break 2902, be wary and we can trade all the way down to 2800."
"21957470","21960770"," But there's nothing saying we can't have like a double. "
"21961690","21963330"," I care as a point right here."
"21963390","21965450"," We roll over to zero line and then come back up."
"21966350","21970730"," So I'm still with you on that trade to the upside. "
"21980950","21981550"," 310130405."
"21982030","21983430"," That's your next stop up here."
"21984230","21986270"," It's right before it's right here. "
"21986670","21989410"," 30 target above 30724."
"21989890","21999690"," The cool part about Bitcoin is you got some"
"21999690","22000630"," craziness coming."
"22004890","22006490"," Yeah, you break above this. "
"22006730","22013790"," If you start breaking above this 30,000, this 303072 and more specifically, you're going to expect"
"22013790","22014790"," volatility in here."
"22017370","22021730"," Between 3724 and 32285, you're going to expect volatility in here."
"22022730","22025170"," But then you're just going to start fucking cranking. "
"22025750","22031410"," So it's something like this."
"22038140","22040320"," Then a power move up on Bitcoin."
"22042600","22043600"," From consolidation. "
"22043940","22047140"," Between this consolidation, you're wearing out some of this vol in here."
"22058520","22061920"," Key points here on, you've got a coil going on here."
"22062620","22066480"," The key point that I want to say to you is, price must stay above. "
"22067400","22071880"," It's like price must, for continuation price must stay above."
"22072180","22073920"," This dream is sponsored by to the tick."
"22073920","22075420"," It must stay above. "
"22076040","22080780"," Fibonacci and market profile levels by signing up at to the tick dot com."
"22082740","22084160"," 29, 911."
"22092080","22095260"," If it doesn't, you will have a pullback. "
"22096040","22098960"," But your pullback will be a buy."
"22100580","22102700"," Just to let it cool off a little bit in here."
"22104720","22107000"," And then you're going to go up there and attack that one up there. "
"22107640","22109520"," I'm very bullish on Bitcoin right now."
"22111660","22112360"," Extremely bullish."
"22113020","22114720"," And you've got daily coming for you. "
"22114820","22116060"," You've got weekly coming for you."
"22116740","22119280"," So even I don't think you're going to get this dip buy down here."
"22120360","22121760"," You might get it end of month. "
"22122140","22123480"," Maybe July, you might grab that."
"22124060","22128000"," As of right now, it continues to hold itself."
"22129140","22131420"," You see that holding itself up here. "
"22132080","22133780"," Demand is still here on hourly trigger."
"22134340","22137100"," And they want to break above that 30,000."
"22137240","22138340"," This one right here is high vol. "
"22138520","22139560"," There's a lot of volatility in here."
"22141420","22143260"," You're going to get to experience some volatility."
"22144880","22145760"," You spell that right. "
"22148400","22152360"," You're going to grind around in here."
"22152420","22156200"," They're not going to want you to get above there on Bitcoin."
"22157880","22159160"," Check out the spy real quick. "
"22160700","22162100"," Yeah, see we're buying it again."
"22162400","22163540"," See these fucking bears, man."
"22163540","22164740"," They don't fucking know when to quit. "
"22164820","22166400"," You see these guys down here?"
"22167080","22168100"," These fucking bears."
"22168360","22170380"," I'm telling you right now, this is not bull bearish."
"22170440","22173120"," We are fucking bullish as fuck right now. "
"22173620","22176220"," I assure you, no selling in here."
"22176680","22182700"," I give a fine fuck about any noise right now in the spy complex right now."
"22182820","22183980"," We're going to the fucking moon. "
"22184640","22185520"," Well, not the moon."
"22185680","22187920"," We're going to go up here and go to the return of the scene, the crime up here."
"22188100","22190000"," It's like all these like one minute, five minute charts. "
"22190740","22192100"," You're looking at means shit."
"22192100","22194660"," Like this is going sky high right here."
"22195420","22196840"," And you can see it on the cues. "
"22197620","22200760"," All that drama for the last five minutes, 338, right?"
"22200920","22202400"," All that fucking drama for nothing."
"22203400","22204600"," And I'm going to tell you something."
"22206220","22208740"," Cues outperform, but the cues trade with the spy. "
"22209420","22212560"," So if the cues are going up, the spy is going up."
"22212680","22216860"," You ain't seen cues go up and fucking spies, shit the bed or any of that kind of stuff."
"22217320","22220000"," So right in here is one of your proofs. "
"22220000","22223340"," You guys hear me talk about NDX all the time in the background."
"22224520","22226260"," And what is happening right now?"
"22226420","22227200"," I thought we were crashing."
"22227920","22229740"," I thought we're fucking crashing here. "
"22230620","22232580"," That we're in the middle of a crash or something."
"22235340","22236300"," All bullshit."
"22236940","22237520"," All scams. "
"22239020","22239300"," Moon mission."
"22244550","22249430"," I'll hold that until fucking until tomorrow's fucking closed."
"22249430","22253350"," So you come back and you check this in two days, three days. "
"22253470","22254490"," You tell me if I'm wrong."
"22256170","22257590"," We're about to fucking moon."
"22258770","22259910"," I love this, huh?"
"22260430","22262570"," Like whiny bitch hedge fund shit. "
"22262730","22264190"," Get the fuck out of here."
"22264610","22265610"," We're going up, bro."
"22265670","22266450"," We're not going down. "
"22268550","22270230"," Let's see how we close this day."
"22271770","22272730"," PT two."
"22273950","22275970"," Close me on that PT two, baby. "
"22276770","22277650"," Right there."
"22278450","22281250"," Matter of fact, got me up overnight right there."
"22283010","22285310"," Fucking smoking crack thinking that's fucking happening. "
"22286950","22287670"," Smoking crack."
"22293870","22294370"," All right."
"22294890","22295910"," I'll stay with you guys right now. "
"22295910","22296730"," I got to do some work though."
"22296810","22297490"," I'll keep the mic on."
"22298370","22299650"," I got something I got to do, man. "
"22299850","22303590"," Like you guys don't understand like after the show, I work until like 11 and 12 at night."
"22304410","22307450"," And like I have you guys see what I you guys see what I'm doing here in stream, but you"
"22307450","22308830"," have no idea what I'm doing in the background."
"22309350","22311030"," And it's like it's wearing on me. "
"22311030","22313250"," It's like 12 hour days never ends."
"22313930","22316490"," So I got to do some work while we're here into this close."
"22316790","22318450"," I will be here with you and put some jams on. "
"22318810","22320510"," I'm going to watch this close right now."
"22321030","22323290"," You're going to expect a big move to the upside."
"22323970","22327570"," Do not be buying anything these fucking sellers are telling you. "
"22327910","22331190"," We are going up, not down, up."
"22335910","22339230"," I promise you a hundred fucking percent."
"22339230","22341850"," Well, it's like a it's like a 90 percent chance. "
"22342390","22346150"," Like a 90 percent chance like nine out of 10 times one time we won't."
"22347550","22349110"," And they can do whatever they want over here."
"22349190","22352610"," They can they can do and they can try to try to scream at as loud as they want. "
"22353150","22354950"," They can try to say whatever they want."
"22355290","22358230"," It's it's like literally like nine out of 10 times they're wrong."
"22359530","22360570"," Nine out of 10. "
"22366920","22368040"," Okay, I got to do some shit."
"22368820","22370620"," Maybe I can get you guys helping the way."
"22370620","22375940"," Maybe somebody's help, but probably going to ask the admins in a probably to ask the admins inside"
"22375940","22376420"," of discord. "
"22379240","22383000"," I am for some reason I am fucking sucking at doing web hooks right now."
"22383440","22385120"," I don't know why I'm sucking on web hooks."
"22385320","22389000"," Normally I'm good at them right now like the discord web hook. "
"22389420","22391240"," I used to I used to be great at web hooks."
"22392120","22393820"," Some reason I'm not good at this one."
"22397590","22403050"," What am I looking for here?"
"22414920","22415460"," Oh, shit. "
"22415620","22416900"," How you got to make a phone call give me one second."
"22494020","22495380"," Chris, are you out there?"
"22496000","22500360"," Remember when I called you the other day and I said Chris, remember the other day when I called you"
"22500360","22503400"," and I said, Hey, I said I'll trade a thousand dollars with you."
"22503420","22503640"," You ready?"
"22504220","22505340"," You ready for the trade brother?"

"22556170","22556910"," Am I talking to myself?"
"22559030","22561150"," Did anybody hear me out there in stream when I said that?"
"22561590","22562770"," Croissant, here's your trade. "

"22586790","22587690"," I spent time with you. "
"22588970","22590610"," Fucking paper traded if you have to."
"22592350","22593110"," I don't care."
"22593710","22595530"," I told you I'd do 10 trades with you, right?"
"22598190","22600010"," Fucking mark it on a piece of paper. "
"22600110","22601190"," Get in the options chain."
"22601410","22602330"," See what it costs right now."
"22603150","22605330"," When you get me, I'll tell you what I'm going to fucking sell it. "

"23029080","23032540"," So if you're out there right now, croissants send an email or just sent you an email. "
"23100760","23103320"," Come on, come on, do it for daddy."
"23106470","23109870"," All these bears don't want to give it up into the close."
"23111270","23113330"," They know they have to give it up. "
"23120020","23122560"," They know they're not going to win here."
"23123000","23124800"," I don't care how long it takes."
"23125840","23127400"," They know they can't win. "
"23128480","23130860"," They know they have to close their shorts."
"23132960","23135180"," You know and I know."
"23139240","23144780"," You know and I know where this is going and I know that you know that I know where this"

"23175260","23179380"," 438 C's trading 44 cents right now into the close."
"23180140","23183780"," You could probably take the money off after the bell and jump right back in for Friday. "
"23185480","23191080"," Trading 44 cents on 438 C's right now."
"23191080","23193360"," Give me that fucking P2 up there."
"23195060","23197960"," Lying to these traders and telling them we're going down. "
