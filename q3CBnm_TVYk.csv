"185780","187860"," And I want to show you where we are. "
"189060","192620"," So I want you to see this is a tough one for me."
"192760","193940"," It is a big tech company."
"194680","198200"," It's been tech and it has been filled underneath it. "
"198340","200040"," How would you play it, Tony?"
"200380","201100"," Where we are right here."
"201440","203100"," Oh, how the market's looking?"
"203340","207870"," I mean, I think I'd be in January just to give myself a little bit of time live stream here."
"208470","214610"," And I want you to see, I want you to see kind of where we are and show this to"
"214610","214710"," you. "
"214710","214910"," Okay."
"215310","216870"," So you can see my cursor right here."
"216870","220050"," And this kind of lines up with this level here, right?"
"220150","223390"," You want to see this support old this morning. "
"223790","229410"," And I was waiting to know that there's going to be a difference between, of course, ES, the ES"
"229410","237050"," contracts and spy, as you know, I think it's $1.33 difference in those contracts."
"237530","242670"," So whenever I if I ever call out to you today, anything like an ES price, I'm like, Hey, the"
"242670","243650"," top here is 4000."
"244430","246350"," You're going to you're going to take 400, right?"
"246430","248850"," And you're going to minus a dollar 33. "
"248850","253730"," I think that's what it is right now about about a buck 33 as well as what we want to"
"253730","256130"," feel like the numbers we want to be looking at today."
"256269","256410"," Okay."
"257170","260690"," So if I shout out anything to you today, I don't want you to see my cursor is right here. "
"260870","266590"," We'll go around that we'll go around the the market this morning and take a look at everything."
"266590","268850"," So you guys, we got a whole bunch of stuff."
"268930","273510"," We'll talk short, mid and long term on the stock market where we are where we think we're going. "
"276770","277610"," You guys hear that?"
"278550","279990"," Oh, you guys can hear that, can't you?"
"279990","280930"," Yeah, let me see."
"281030","281570"," I'll turn that off."
"283970","285230"," I had tasty works off. "
"285650","287830"," I had tasty works on this morning playing."
"288310","293710"," I don't like listening to say that they're saying something in the next day and some side the chat."
"294530","298590"," So I don't listen to I stopped listening to CNBC a long, long time ago. "
"299110","300490"," So I'll listen to anything but CNBC."
"301210","307110"," So if I have a live stream in the background, sometimes I'll put on a tasty live or I'll put"
"307110","311830"," on the stock charts of live if they've got something going on."
"313790","314970"," It's good to see you guys. "
"315210","318610"," So I turned it off, but we're going to go through pay crayon Somalia."
"318610","319450"," Good to see you brother."
"319850","320590"," Willie smoke me. "
"320690","321230"," Good to see you."
"321330","321830"," Just some guy."
"321930","322490"," Good to see you. "
"323110","323870"," Everybody's in here, right?"
"324110","324730"," Mel yells in here."
"324870","325490"," Urgo's in here."
"326930","328510"," So I turned all that sound off for you guys. "
"329870","331150"," I turned it all off for you."
"331510","332790"," We're going to talk about a couple of things here."
"332850","336030"," Okay, we'll get we'll get into a whole bunch of stuff later this morning. "
"337070","337970"," Some cool stuff."
"338050","340110"," We're going to start the live stream back up for a bunch of reasons."
"340110","345710"," We're going to talk about why that is mostly to do with stock pumpers, gurus, all that kind of"
"345710","345870"," shit. "
"346150","348110"," You guys you guys have been with me for a long time."
"348110","355870"," They already know what my take was on you know, like push like I get emails all the time from"
"355870","361150"," people saying, hey, if you want to pump this or pump that or pump this or grow your numbers, all"
"361150","361930"," kinds of fucking nonsense."
"362770","364150"," And I told you guys I'd never do that. "
"364270","370190"," I told you guys I'd never take that kind of money or become that kind of a live streamer for"
"370190","370390"," you."
"370690","372890"," And all this shit that's been coming down, I figured, well, fuck it."
"372970","374250"," Maybe it's time to start streaming again. "
"375710","377210"," Because it's bizarre out there, right?"
"377370","378470"," We know that it's bizarre out there."
"378530","379370"," We know streamers are bizarre."
"379910","381070"," You know, YouTube videos are bizarre. "
"382210","382810"," So we know what's up."
"383650","385110"," Hell yeah, everybody love all you guys."
"385370","389590"," So so this morning, we'll get to that at some point just because if you any guys are in the"
"389590","393050"," market at this moment, well, right away, we're just going to start with today, okay?"
"393630","395250"," So you've got an OPEC stay today, right?"
"396310","398010"," We know it's a big OPEC stay today. "
"399910","402950"," Likely today, I think we're going to close on a low today."
"403070","404310"," Say it's going to be a week, week day."
"405230","407450"," And I think it might even be week into Monday, okay?"
"407950","410610"," Though I don't think that this run is quite over yet. "
"410690","414010"," We'd have to see some, we'd have to see some, some lows."
"414150","415970"," We'll take a look at those later on today as well."
"416650","419130"," But right off right off right off the gate here, right?"
"419410","420970"," Last night, we had that dip. "
"421170","426370"," I was talking to Joe Joe donut like yesterday and we were right down here and I was telling Joe"
"426370","428350"," I'm like, I'm on the phone and I'm like, we're going to get a bounce here."
"429090","430030"," But I wasn't on Twitter."
"430050","434750"," So I kind of felt bad yesterday that I didn't talk to you guys about this bounce and buying this"
"434750","436010"," bounce into the clothes. "
"436010","441790"," And the reason being was because yesterday we hit resistance up here at the 396."
"442710","445050"," But there were sellers above it 400."
"445590","449810"," I think yesterday I said on Twitter, 398 was the price target. "
"450030","452910"," And then we hit that price target today at the open."
"453410","454930"," We did it overnight here."
"455210","457530"," We had a beautiful bounce down below here at 39. "
"457770","460010"," I think it was 390 says here, 391."
"460290","463250"," But this is basically where, where buyers were just setting up."
"463590","469410"," And then there was a standing order of a sell order above up here that's been sitting there for at"
"469410","470090"," least a couple of days. "
"470370","471590"," So we know we're going to hit that."
"471730","473910"," We kind of hit it already once today."
"474730","479110"," And I want you to see here, see these gaps are being filled right here, this gray area on the"
"479110","479290"," screen. "
"479970","481790"," So they're trying to fill these gaps right now."
"482190","485890"," And I will switch back to book maps so you can see them filling these gaps."
"486030","486630"," This is kind of like it. "
"486830","489610"," This is kind of where my cursor is kind of like, this is support."
"490430","494470"," If we don't, if we don't stand the support, we have a long way down here, right?"
"494570","500810"," If I scroll over here, you really are kind of looking like we're now in a one hour chart here,"
"500950","500990"," right?"
"501050","507590"," If we break through this area here, and this white box is where large, large supply is in the"
"507590","507910"," market."
"508570","511390"," So right down here, let's say do a little rectangle down here. "
"512030","514650"," And we kind of have, this is kind of it right here, right?"
"515570","517690"," This is where demand is."
"517850","519250"," It's very low demand right here."
"520169","522270"," And the bears really want to come in. "
"522350","526630"," If you look at this chart that I'm on right here, the bears really want to see us, let me"
"526630","528230"," see if they're going here."
"529490","533690"," The bears this morning, I think I posted on Twitter this morning that the bears want to come in,"
"533810","533930"," right?"
"534350","535770"," And they want to sell this, right?"
"536170","539270"," This is what they're going to call, they're going to tell you this is a bull trap."
"539790","542250"," And they're going to trade this all the way down into Monday. "
"543250","547510"," Now, I don't mind if we trade, actually, I would love if we trade this down into Monday to get"
"547510","551130"," a nice run, a nice holiday run later into next week."
"551470","555230"," So are we bearish if we sell down here today or tomorrow?"
"555670","556250"," We aren't."
"556610","561610"," Now, until we break this, this trend going up, we are not bearish, right?"
"562030","566910"," So if you want to get your bear suit on, I don't know, I don't know who's out there listening"
"566910","568230"," or following along right now. "
"568670","569410"," Yeah, it's been too long."
"569510","570390"," Penny Mac, good to see you."
"570690","572090"," Josh, good to see you brother. "
"572350","573730"," My brother Josh want to give you a hug."
"574150","575310"," Penny Mac, I want to give you a hug."
"575890","576870"," All kinds of people out there. "
"577790","579630"," So, but I don't want you guys to see this, okay?"
"579670","581830"," So just breathe easy, right?"
"581970","583290"," If you're a bull, breathe easy."
"583490","585350"," If you're a bear, breathe easy."
"585770","588270"," You know, you can take this trade down if you wanted to as a bear. "
"588430","591330"," It's not a bad trade into Monday or possibly even Tuesday."
"592130","598770"," But to take this trade down, but I do want you to realize that if you want to get that"
"598770","604650"," bear suit on, you want to get that, you see those guys, you guys, you see those guys on Twitter,"
"604990","605890"," like doom and gloom."
"606530","609110"," If you want doom and gloom, you really can't take this trade. "
"609510","613590"," If you want to take this bear trade, you need to switch it up."
"613970","615590"," Let me get to some bear colors going here."
"617130","619130"," So let's say you want to get super bearish, right?"
"619450","622570"," You can be bearish down here if you want, let's say, right?"
"623110","628110"," You can't get the full bear suit on for the end of the year for that JPM college trade. "
"628830","632170"," I think it's down at 3300 or somewhere in that neighborhood up, look it up."
"633430","639730"," But if you want that JPM college trade, you're going to have to wait until we find this right here,"
"639850","639930"," right?"
"639990","640490"," Some resistance."
"641190","643910"," And then you take this trade down for a few hundred points. "
"644410","647650"," If you want to take take that three 400 points or whatever, it's going to be."
"647950","649910"," You still have to wait until this happens."
"650110","650990"," You can't be like Mike Barry. "
"651390","653370"," I'm fucking hell of short right in here, right?"
"653810","654690"," I think he was a back here."
"654750","656330"," He was screaming that he was hell of fucking short."
"656330","657890"," There's some little boobies. "
"658430","662330"," Maybe that's maybe that's somebody's butt with hemorrhoids or something."
"662490","663830"," The hemorrhoids are in here or something like that."
"663990","667510"," But you can't really be that bearish here. "
"667670","668350"," You have to wait."
"668630","669630"," You have to have confirmation."
"670330","673070"," And I can explain it to you even better, right?"
"673570","675810"," Which is if you're looking at this right here, right?"
"676830","678170"," How many times?"
"678970","679670"," Let's count them, right?"
"680190","684390"," We got one, two, three, four, four times, right?"
"684610","686030"," We have an upwards trend. "
"686590","687530"," We already know that."
"688150","689590"," We already know that way up here."
"690090","692630"," This is this trend line that everyone wants to short. "
"693670","695150"," Everybody knows we short up here."
"695310","701070"," Everybody knows if the market's going to turn around because we've done it four times in the past"
"701070","702790"," year to be traded up."
"702890","703830"," That's where we're going, right?"
"705750","707930"," So even if we go up here, everybody knows, right?"
"708030","708970"," We short all this right?"
"709070","709430"," No matter what. "
"709570","711710"," And we've got bears that are saying, no, I want to short this right now."
"712090","712950"," I want that bear trap."
"712950","714390"," And then I want to crash the whole entire market. "
"714530","715270"," I'm fine with all this."
"715270","716710"," I'm okay with all this."
"716870","717630"," I don't mind all this. "
"718530","721270"," But you can't be like, hey, I'm cap."
"721530","726350"," I full-ported 100% of my accounts into shorting right fucking here or cap."
"726570","730010"," I don't care if it comes up and then we come back down because I don't think you're Mike Barry. "
"730130","733570"," I don't think you can just call somebody up on the phone and say, yeah, I need another fucking"
"733570","736890"," hundred million dollars to cover the short that I'm in them already upside down."
"736890","738390"," And eventually it's going to print 100%."
"738390","740330"," I don't care if it's now or in six months. "
"740710","741350"," You're not that guy."
"741490","742050"," I'm not that guy."
"742150","742830"," You can't do that. "
"743050","747970"," I promise you, and you shouldn't have that mentality as a trader at all or an investor."
"748610","749950"," We need to trade what's in front of you."
"750050","752450"," I want you to realize that for where we are. "
"752630","755710"," So let's just say for today and tomorrow I'm a bull."
"756470","758590"," What do I want to see the market do?"
"758990","760370"," Well, I want to see weakness."
"761690","762050"," Okay. "
"762270","764390"," So if we're looking here, I want to see weakness."
"765310","768030"," I want you to see this blue line right here, right?"
"768610","770930"," This is that 200 moving average, right?"
"771270","774230"," You've had nice reaction off that we can look at it back over here."
"774490","777390"," I want you to see that moving average, right?"
"777830","779370"," We're going to change this back to green because we're bull. "
"780130","781610"," And then we'll go right to the bears again."
"781870","787730"," But right now you can see that when we when we trade below this blue line right here, right?"
"788370","789210"," We get some nice rips."
"789210","789950"," We got a rip there. "
"790210","791110"," We got a rip there."
"791290","792610"," We got a rip there, right?"
"792950","798950"," Yeah, this one, right got a little bit of thing."
"799110","800270"," Fuck, we already came up here, right?"
"800350","801890"," We went to 403 up here. "
"802210","804710"," I want to see us trade down, right?"
"804910","806550"," And then and then buy that there."
"806650","807490"," I don't want to be buying this."
"807710","809210"," I mean, I can buy this yesterday for a day trade. "
"809590","811850"," But if I want a big trade, I want it to come down here."
"812410","815310"," I want to come down to like three, five, three, 80."
"815670","817270"," I want some like scariness. "
"818170","819050"," This is what I want to buy."
"819470","820710"," And what I want to see if I'm a bull."
"820870","824010"," I want to see a straight down here, right?"
"824330","825590"," Maybe we dip down for a minute. "
"825970","827630"," One, two, and then we're off and running."
"828250","831750"," I don't want to see what I don't want to see because I don't want to see us trade below"
"831750","833350"," this trend line, right?"
"833910","835710"," And trap in some bulls."
"836190","838510"," Sometimes it'll come straight up above slightly, right?"
"838810","840190"," One, two, and then boom, we fail. "
"840870","844730"," And we're kind of we're kind of in shit's luck as a as a as a as a bull or"
"844730","845010"," as a bear."
"845310","849910"," Now if I'm I'm a bull, I would still short this market under here."
"850170","853630"," If we start to trade down in here, I'm going to pick up a short I'm going to pick up"
"853630","857490"," a put spread or whatever that is for the end of the year. "
"857610","860710"," I'm going to pick it up maybe for the end of the year, maybe maybe maybe end of January or"
"860710","864330"," even March for this for this low coming up down here."
"864590","867470"," But until this happens, you just can't don't do it on Twitter."
"867630","871610"," Don't be running around telling people on Twitter, like I'm super fucking bearish and the fucking"
"871610","872670"," market's going to burn to the ground. "
"873110","875370"," You can say that but have some context."
"875910","878390"," Don't be like people argue with me on Twitter all the time."
"878550","880350"," They're like, well, I'm super fucking bearish here. "
"880350","883510"," And then when it doesn't happen, they're fucking super fucking bearish again the next time."
"883990","888990"," And so I'm like, yeah, I'm like, be honest with me be like, Hey, I want to I want to"
"888990","889810"," short this right here."
"889810","890710"," I'm like, that makes sense. "
"891730","892130"," Right."
"892530","894190"," I think we're right up here this past week."
"894670","899630"," And I posted that someone bought a million dollars in some puts 390 puts. "
"899990","901770"," And I was like, and they were dated for like January or something."
"901770","903190"," But I'm like, that's a great trade."
"903510","904930"," And then we did we came down here. "
"904930","908370"," They cashed out their trades on this open and they took along."
"908750","911230"," So I think that's a great trade."
"911330","912210"," I think that makes sense. "
"912490","912570"," Right."
"912790","914250"," That's makes logical sense to me."
"914790","916670"," And it looks like it's a trade that'll pay. "
"917310","921690"," And so when you talk to people on Twitter, right, I want you to think about that stuff when you're"
"921690","924850"," saying, Hey, I'm bearish from bullish or why are you so bullish?"
"925770","926670"," Why am I so bearish?"
"926810","927850"," Why is it here that I am?"
"929090","932730"," Because it's important for it's important for me at least and probably other people to take you"
"932730","938010"," seriously out there as to why you're bearish, when you're bearish, when you're bullish, when you're"
"938010","940570"," going to enter that trade, when's the right time to take that trade."
"941130","944750"," So if you're a bear out there right now, right, what's the trade for you right now?"
"944870","947770"," The trade for you is for a bull, a bull trap here."
"948330","950230"," Hopefully you can get a bull trap right here. "
"950510","953910"," You want to see, you want to see us being led down, which we are right now."
"954210","961410"," And you want to see this trade, you want to take this trade just to, we got this blue line,"
"961550","965090"," right, this 200 ma, right, this is, and you can see it in the right hand side of the screen,"
"965530","972350"," it's 386.91. So you're looking for like 385, right, it's the safe, that's the safe short, right, if"
"972350","975990"," you're going to get greedy and leave a little bit on, right, or you want to take, leave some puts"
"975990","979450"," on or something, you can take it down here to this trend line or slightly below this."
"979790","986210"," But that's it, you close out your trade, right, and you then watch and wait for the market to guide"
"986210","986430"," you. "
"986570","992270"," You want to see the, you want to see the algos in the banks tell you where we're headed before"
"992270","996390"," you put on the rest of it, the confirmation for us heading down from here."
"996750","998850"," Does that make sense for all of this to take place?"
"999370","1001750"," What you don't want to do is be like, I'm on full bore in here."
"1002050","1003130"," I'm going to hold it to the end. "
"1003670","1004590"," Who does that?"
"1004730","1008090"," I forget the guy's name was a good friend of ours, a good friend of the program."
"1008090","1011170"," He'll buy a short up here and he'll be like, fuck it, I don't care."
"1011290","1012930"," I'm going to hold it for the next six months until it happens. "
"1013410","1014910"," I can understand that trade too, I guess."
"1015350","1018110"," But if we trade up here, and you're 100%, we're doomed."
"1019010","1023329"," So me, for me, for all these years, all these years have been trading. "
"1024190","1027530"," The best thing that I've found to do is to trade what's in front of you."
"1027650","1032970"," So you take that trade down here, you take the next leg down here, and you're in and you're out,"
"1033089","1037490"," and you're in and you're out, and then it doesn't matter which way we head."
"1037630","1043230"," If we end up coming down here, reversing courses, I'm not stuck in that trade any longer, right?"
"1043430","1043890"," You see what I'm saying?"
"1044030","1047670"," I can close that trade, and I can take and not get caught with my pants down, right?"
"1048270","1049230"," And take the trade higher. "
"1049970","1052930"," Well, if we continue down, I don't need all this money here."
"1053330","1057030"," I don't need to have this money here if we're going to continue down."
"1057810","1058390"," Does that make sense?"
"1058930","1064090"," I don't need this little bit of money there. "
"1064190","1064670"," Does that make sense?"
"1065370","1071030"," Where I need this right here, this right here, and then all this right here, rather than just,"
"1071030","1076190"," rather than just be like, I'm full fucking bearish from full fucking bullish or whatever."
"1076270","1076730"," That shit's nonsense."
"1077410","1077690"," I promise. "
"1078350","1079370"," I promise you it's nonsense."
"1081730","1082290"," All right."
"1082770","1084830"," So I'm back to the rant today, to the cap rant. "
"1085170","1086230"," We're going to switch back over real quick."
"1086330","1089490"," We're going to look at Book Map, and I'll show you some other stuff."
"1089630","1094290"," I'll bring up, I'm going to bring up some other stuff for you. "
"1094470","1096990"," And I'm sorry for this big black screen down here."
"1097070","1100790"," I got some like stuff I'm going to be scrolling or whatever."
"1100950","1102570"," We're going to be doing a bunch of Joe Harper's in here. "
"1105660","1108720"," Josh is saying, Tessa, look at the massive red boy, Cody's in here."
"1109140","1109960"," Joe, good to see him, brother."
"1111800","1116420"," I just talked about you, Joe, just a few minutes ago on the live stream because I was talking to"
"1116420","1118200"," you yesterday, and I was like, I think I'm going to buy that fucking dip. "
"1118900","1119300"," Sorry."
"1119440","1120340"," Anyways, just right here."
"1120440","1121160"," Let's take a look real quick. "
"1121660","1123440"," I'm going to take a look real quick with you."
"1125180","1127740"," Bring my cursor over and you can see they're stepping us down."
"1127900","1128620"," We're going to step here. "
"1129140","1130540"," We got another step down below."
"1130620","1132280"," We've got some buyers stepping in here."
"1132560","1135260"," These buyers weren't here previously over here, right?"
"1135760","1138260"," We're just stepping it down and stepping it down over here. "
"1138840","1141340"," And I want you to see in the right hand side of the screen."
"1142340","1144220"," I want you to take a real good look."
"1145240","1147360"," We're going to take a real good look on the right hand side of the screen, right?"
"1147660","1150300"," That dome that's on the right hand side and it's weak. "
"1151080","1152100"," It's weak buyers."
"1152740","1154500"," It's weak buyers down to 3,900."
"1155300","1156020"," It really is. "
"1156140","1159600"," If you look on the right hand side, you'll see like 10,000 buyers on the bottom down there."
"1160260","1160800"," They're like 3,900."
"1161360","1162520"," You'll see 11,000 buyers. "
"1163020","1164440"," It looks like we're being led down."
"1165180","1166200"," Now, could we catch a bounce here?"
"1166380","1166560"," Possibly."
"1167780","1173420"," But with the dom usually looks like it looks like we're in a selling environment here. "
"1177670","1182730"," And we still, you see by cursor over here, you see that, see that, see this supply zone and above."
"1183110","1187790"," Even if we were to trade up here today, I'm going to expect us to keep hitting this supply zone"
"1187790","1189850"," for sellers at some point."
"1191530","1196030"," So I just want you to see right here, you see this 7,500 sellers down here. "
"1196350","1205770"," We've got weak buyers over here on the right hand side of, of, see the right hand side of this"
"1205770","1205950"," dome."
"1206290","1208970"," We've got weak buyers on this bounce right now."
"1209230","1210510"," So I'm just going to switch back again real quick. "
"1211550","1215550"," Pay with me because they got a, this is all kind of new."
"1217970","1219050"," Take a look right here."
"1220070","1226290"," And you can see right here, we'll switch this up and we're going to make this yellow. "
"1226930","1230290"," Or we'll make this, make this green or blue, right with blue."
"1231570","1235750"," And we'll put some text in there and we'll just say text."
"1236190","1237270"," And we'll put this right here. "
"1237850","1242310"," And we're just going to say, we're going to say weak buyers, right?"
"1242450","1243450"," We'll just write them weak buyers."
"1247170","1251910"," Save that and we'll change the color to yellow or orange or something like that."
"1251990","1253010"," We got some weak buyers here. "
"1254570","1255530"," We know they're in here."
"1255670","1257550"," We know they're trying to, we're trying to hold on here."
"1258010","1263330"," We also want to, we also want to show where real support is in the market and that's down here. "
"1264390","1265170"," We're real support."
"1265370","1266670"," It's where the smart money is."
"1266750","1267730"," You want to know what the smart money is?"
"1268250","1269330"," Smart money's down here. "
"1271090","1276330"," So the smart buyers are, they're like, hey, between now and Monday, this is what I want to buy,"
"1276950","1277630"," right?"
"1278030","1282330"," When we know up here, this is where the supply is, right?"
"1283870","1285050"," Change this to red."
"1285530","1291270"," You guys should do this on your own too, on your own charting software, whatever you're using."
"1292170","1296590"," We'll do a big sellers, right?"
"1296950","1297810"," We'll make a big sellers. "
"1298790","1299530"," That's a supply."
"1300190","1305380"," I meant, I'll make this a yellow as well."
"1307860","1310140"," You can kind of visualize this now, right?"
"1310340","1313880"," You've got where the real buyers are. "
"1314160","1315220"," Some weak buyers down here."
"1315340","1316560"," We got big sellers above, right?"
"1316980","1319000"," You know, supplies up here, right?"
"1319820","1321360"," And so where do I want to buy as a bull?"
"1321500","1322240"," I want to buy it down here."
"1322820","1325020"," I want to buy it down here today for Monday. "
"1325600","1327920"," Wouldn't shock me to see us trade down here to close."
"1328580","1332040"," And then I would like to pick this back up at 390, right?"
"1332320","1334600"," I want to look at this on a larger chart."
"1335900","1338160"," And where would I get really greedy down in here, right?"
"1338620","1340520"," This is where my real greed greed is. "
"1341060","1342760"," And that's going to be down somewhere in here."
"1342860","1346140"," If I can catch this down here, I'm going to be gangbusters."
"1346200","1348780"," Like this is like money. "
"1349340","1350780"," Like that's where I want to buy."
"1351620","1355060"," I want to buy so anywhere, anywhere down in here is my preferred buy."
"1355240","1357480"," So let's let's see if we can make this up here. "
"1358420","1363570"," Come on now."
"1364110","1364730"," Come on now."
"1365710","1366470"," Right there. "
"1366630","1370870"," Right where that blue line is for that 200 ma is in that down."
"1374210","1377770"," This is really what really where I want to buy is like right in there."
"1378490","1379810"," This is really want to buy Monday. "
"1380250","1382190"," So coming into Monday, this is where I want to buy the market."
"1382310","1384050"," I don't want to buy it here unless it's today."
"1384610","1388550"," If we traded this, maybe if we traded down in here today, I'll buy this. "
"1388710","1390050"," But I'd really like to buy that blue, right?"
"1390150","1391110"," I really want to come down here."
"1391170","1396950"," I want to see see us trade below this 200 ma on the one hour chart, right?"
"1397090","1399130"," We can put on a 15 minute chart, see if that helps."
"1399370","1400930"," And maybe not go back to the one hour. "
"1401770","1403090"," This is kind of like a trend chart."
"1403610","1405270"," One hour is like a nice and a nice trend."
"1405730","1406710"," This is where I want to be a buyer. "
"1407550","1408430"," I don't want to be a buyer up here."
"1408510","1411150"," Do you want to be a buyer right here?"
"1411250","1412830"," No, you want to be a buyer down here, maybe."
"1413350","1414890"," But in reality down here, you want to be a buyer. "
"1415130","1416030"," We'll be a buyer down here."
"1416170","1420730"," So come in here, swoop this up, let the bears have their day, take their money or whatever."
"1421650","1424050"," Now, what could we could save the market today?"
"1424590","1429010"," And that would be puts losing value as you head into the clothes. "
"1433830","1434950"," Hit the legs for a cap."
"1435110","1435570"," Thank you very much."
"1435770","1436330"," Tesla's drilling. "
"1436590","1437070"," Yeah, we'll look at Tesla."
"1437070","1442330"," Uh, I posted, I have a post Jesus Tesla baby."
"1442870","1444170"," What happened to Tesla?"
"1445350","1445950"," Why?"
"1446530","1448910"," Look at that Tesla to do in their Tesla. "
"1448910","1450450"," Come back to Tesla lows again."
"1452130","1460310"," Oh man, there's a I want to tell you that, uh, yeah, last night I was talking to someone and"
"1461870","1463450"," this could be a nice double bottom."
"1464870","1467310"," I like the idea of buying Tesla down here. "
"1467990","1469030"," I want to be honest with you."
"1470830","1473670"," I do like the idea of buying Tesla down here."
"1476920","1477780"," Let me see here. "
"1477920","1481120"," Put another one here somewhere right in there."
"1482360","1483000"," This is juicy."
"1483260","1483820"," I'll be honest with you. "
"1484440","1486480"," I want to trade this like 195 200."
"1486880","1487400"," I want to pick that up."
"1487520","1488200"," I want to pick this trade. "
"1489180","1489320"," I do."
"1490020","1490620"," I'll be honest with you."
"1494150","1495230"," Back when we look at the Dixie. "
"1498410","1500370"," See that nice blue line right here, right?"
"1501030","1501710"," See this blue."
"1501810","1503070"," We've got supply up in here."
"1504810","1509450"," So we're going to bring this down over here. "
"1512470","1513670"," Yeah, that was very time."
"1514450","1518330"," And we can see that we're going to be weak."
"1518470","1520150"," We're going to talk about this before we move forward as well. "
"1520270","1528770"," We're going to talk about looking at, uh, different tickers to tell you underneath the hood quickly"
"1528770","1531370"," what is, what's actually going on."
"1531490","1534210"," What do we expect to happen in the spy or your favorite ticker?"
"1535610","1539630"," So we're, we're going to see that we probably have some sellers up here, right?"
"1540070","1543650"," Right with this blue line is I want you to see this blue line that I've got this 200 right"
"1543650","1544050"," here, right?"
"1544490","1545550"," You seem to sell it, right?"
"1545890","1546050"," Come up."
"1546330","1549030"," We rip up here and we say, what's the bear town at that time?"
"1549470","1550810"," This is like a week or two ago, I think. "
"1552410","1552930"," Excuse me."
"1553590","1555970"," So I'm going to be looking for sellers up in here, right?"
"1556930","1563390"," And I already know that there's buyers of buyers down below, right?"
"1564530","1565970"," So what do I not want to see?"
"1566050","1567090"," I don't want to see this, right?"
"1567290","1572430"," I'm going to bet that this is heading down towards that 385 and up here is going to be like"
"1572430","1574070"," below 385, something like that."
"1574450","1576030"," So we know you've got buyers down here. "
"1576070","1578090"," We've got sellers probably hiding up in here."
"1578090","1579890"," So I'm going to keep this current."
"1580270","1582970"," We look like we're forming a base on Dixie, right?"
"1583150","1585070"," This is bearish kind of bearish, right?"
"1585290","1587030"," For the moment we're trading higher. "
"1587470","1591630"," Looks like Dixie buyers want to at least get up to 168."
"1592390","1599030"," So I'm going to take Dixie as being a bearish today until you'll get HYG, right?"
"1599250","1601230"," We've got some supply above here and HYG, right?"
"1601350","1605130"," We've got sellers above on HYG and we've got this trend going up."
"1605470","1609750"," I'd like to see HYG come down, fill this gap down below at $73. "
"1610350","1612570"," So this is kind of a bearish chart to spy, right?"
"1612750","1616210"," So everything's saying bearish on HYG, right?"
"1616470","1620670"," We're going to take a look at the Dixie, excuse me, at the VIX, right?"
"1620890","1626110"," We'll go mount down on the VIX and let's take a look on a larger time frame."
"1626430","1629310"," Let's need to go for our time frame."
"1630510","1632170"," And we can see we're on some support, right?"
"1633010","1637490"," You can see that we've got other, you can see that we've got some gaps down below and if you"
"1637490","1642810"," fill, VIX is telling you can go either way, but there's some other tickers that are telling you to"
"1642810","1648870"," watch out that we are looking bearish on other tickers. "
"1648870","1650310"," So just those four tickers."
"1651290","1656790"," I'm going to Dixie, VIX, HYG, spy, and what does it tell me?"
"1656890","1660350"," It's telling me that the market's weak today for bulls."
"1661310","1662250"," That's what it's telling me. "
"1662830","1666390"," VIX is telling me you could trade low, we could get another bounce here, clean all this up down"
"1666390","1666630"," here."
"1667510","1670270"," But in all honesty, the market looks weak to me."
"1671750","1674250"," So that's what I'm going to take it as today, right?"
"1674430","1677150"," Because that's my stance is that market is weak today. "
"1678190","1681750"," Now the only other thing that was going to help a bull out today for today is going to be"
"1681750","1683350"," cashing out all these puts."
"1683750","1686290"," You've got trillions of dollars and puts that are expiring today."
"1686850","1691710"," Hopefully we can get a trade up higher into the bell off these weak buyers and see if this holds. "
"1692630","1693910"," So I'm going to scroll through right now."
"1694010","1694470"," We're going to take a look."
"1695150","1696110"," We've got some support. "
"1696210","1698130"," We've got some buyers stepping in to the market."
"1698510","1701870"," I'm going to show you book map real quick and you can see that some of these buyers here can"
"1701870","1703090"," see us bouncing back and forth."
"1704510","1706450"," You can see this resistance right here. "
"1706490","1710050"," We'll see if the bulls can break through and take this higher."
"1710270","1716450"," I want you to look at two other spots at 3980 and 3982 and then ultimately 400."
"1717330","1720430"," So we'll see if we can break through this resistance and take a trade higher. "
"1722510","1725470"," I'm going to answer some of your questions here right now."
"1725950","1727110"," I'm going to go through some of your questions."
"1728510","1731330"," Your wife's boyfriend, good to see you, my brother. "
"1731730","1732210"," Good more investment."
"1732630","1733930"," That's good to see you, my brother."
"1735310","1736170"," So let's go through. "
"1741510","1743370"," I'm going to go through and talk about whatever you guys want to talk about this moment."
"1746710","1747770"," Do you act as flying?"
"1749430","1750910"," What do you guys got farming this morning?"
"1751450","1752250"," Postal questions."
"1753850","1755730"," If you got put, why don't you post some questions?"
"1757150","1757990"," Everyone's in here, right?"
"1758250","1758770"," Let's post a question. "
"1758950","1759970"," I got a bunch of stuff to tell you guys."
"1760150","1766230"," So let's start with the state of YouTube and gurus."
"1767510","1769350"," Things are ugly right now. "
"1769470","1770270"," We all know that, right?"
"1770490","1771890"," Things are ugly for YouTubers."
"1772850","1778270"," We know that YouTubers are, we already, we always knew this, but they're being exposed, right?"
"1779730","1782010"," Is the river trade still on with a bear market?"
"1784390","1785030"," VSCO, what up?"
"1785610","1786490"," TAP is here, it's happening."
"1786730","1787730"," I love the last market breath. "
"1788130","1790210"," What EMA was that, the one-hour chart cap?"
"1791490","1792250"," Let's take a look."
"1792530","1800530"," Let's go back to the one-hour chart and we're looking at, so I've got a 200MA."
"1800530","1802950"," This blue line right here is a 200MA, okay?"
"1804070","1807010"," So we're, so let's talk about where we are in the market, right?"
"1807210","1808790"," So we're in a one-hour chart, right?"
"1809830","1812670"," So what are, are we bearish or bullish in this one-hour chart?"
"1813710","1817030"," We're bullish and because trend is up, right?"
"1817130","1818310"," We're still, trend is still up. "
"1819230","1821330"," We know that major resistance is above."
"1821930","1823390"," Currently, it changes every day."
"1823390","1831030"," It's currently at 408, let's say for today, it's at 410.36 and it goes down every day as time"
"1831030","1831470"," passes. "
"1832190","1833730"," But we know that this trend is up."
"1834250","1838590"," We know that we're getting a huge reaction on the 200."
"1839190","1843630"," We know in this blue line, if we trade below it, we stay within this trend, that we buy that"
"1843630","1844390"," for a trade higher. "
"1844810","1849350"," We know that we don't get bearish on this one-hour chart unless we trade below it."
"1849850","1852430"," So you guys can pick a snapshot of the screen if you want."
"1852990","1855610"," We get super bearish, anything down here, right?"
"1856250","1859190"," This is where we start looking for that JPM collar trade to go lower. "
"1859870","1863330"," If you're looking at a smaller time frame, I'm bearish here personally."
"1863530","1867310"," I'm bearish here into Monday for a dip buy down here where my cursor is."
"1870450","1871950"," So we're going to burn to the ground. "
"1872350","1877750"," Can you talk about how a light order book looks compared to what I would look like before this year"
"1877750","1879630"," using book map?"
"1879890","1880590"," Yes, what is it?"
"1881850","1885030"," Moving on to ESMS, moving to trading 10-year treasuries next month."
"1885230","1886010"," That's super super cool."
"1886130","1887770"," Let's check it in, Brian. "
"1888310","1890390"," How's his health doing, by the way?"
"1893530","1895610"," What do you see Tesla bought?"
"1895750","1896390"," You guys have a bunch of…"
"1896390","1898670"," All right, let me go back up here and answer a bunch of questions."
"1900050","1901410"," Okay, so J Money answered that."
"1901670","1903550"," Is this IBM run a dud?"
"1903730","1904990"," I haven't looked at IBM in a while. "
"1904990","1906310"," I'll be honest with you."
"1906510","1907410"," I can look at it, though."
"1907750","1908130"," I will. "
"1910050","1911370"," Thoughts on bond yields?"
"1912950","1914810"," What are my thoughts on bond yields?"
"1916410","1917550"," That's a long answer."
"1917970","1919470"," You guys are asking me questions that I got to go over."
"1919850","1920890"," You guys are asking me questions. "
"1921130","1923290"," I have to go into a lot of detail on…"
"1923290","1924450"," All right, so let me write this down."
"1924690","1925010"," How about this?"
"1925830","1930510"," The questions that are long, I'm going to answer bond yields."
"1932070","1935450"," I want a quick question. "
"1935770","1938190"," You guys are asking me to spend 20, 15, 20 minutes."
"1939530","1940050"," All right, hold on a second."
"1940170","1940590"," Bond yields. "
"1942190","1944670"," Tesla calls or puts Carlos Perez."
"1946330","1948370"," Tesla, we can do this one quick."
"1948830","1950270"," So on Tesla, hold on a second. "
"1953150","1955230"," I'm actually bullish on Tesla here."
"1957090","1959070"," I am bullish on Tesla down here."
"1959190","1961370"," Now, my overall…"
"1961370","1963150"," Let's talk about this. "
"1963310","1966190"," You don't want to see Tesla break below…"
"1970500","1973900"," You don't want to see Tesla break this area here."
"1974440","1980280"," If Tesla has a new low, below 175, 14, it is bad fucking news for Tesla."
"1981440","1982600"," We will go back. "
"1983260","1984760"," I can't do it on this chart."
"1984940","1988940"," This charting software kind of sucks on Tesla."
"1993180","1994900"," And that's the problem. "
"1995260","1996040"," I want you to see this."
"1996280","2000000"," If Tesla breaks below here, I want you to see this right here."
"2000780","2003520"," There's no support until we get down to this 140. "
"2004300","2009300"," So, yeah, if you want to take a short on Tesla, it's going to be below a new low on"
"2009300","2009520"," 175."
"2010200","2015420"," You'll see us then trade down and try to close this gap at 144 to 140."
"2016400","2018660"," This is some weak support here, though, as well. "
"2019260","2021140"," So I want you to start looking back here, right?"
"2021640","2023300"," And start looking at real support in Tesla."
"2023720","2026780"," And, you know, we're talking about…"
"2026780","2028480"," We're probably talking about…"
"2028480","2040140"," I think I told somebody here that my price target is right around 90 bucks somewhere in here, as"
"2040140","2041800"," my price target, somewhere in this vicinity."
"2042960","2045720"," I think you'll still see some greediness. "
"2046880","2049320"," You'll still see buyers step in right here."
"2050020","2052920"," I still think you're going to see buyers step in this 140 mark."
"2056239","2058960"," But the reality is…"
"2058960","2060739"," Where do I ultimately think it's going?"
"2060860","2061719"," I think it's going down here. "
"2062060","2062199"," I do."
"2063179","2069080"," I think that Tesla is going to be weak into at least this 140."
"2070020","2073739"," And I think I'd probably give it like a 60% chance we go there. "
"2074060","2075000"," Let me bring this up a little bit."
"2077780","2079500"," Somewhere down right here."
"2080520","2087719"," So this is 91.96. That wouldn't shock me to see us go down there. "
"2088139","2092639"," Now, even though if this is my ultimate price target, it's 90 bucks I think."
"2092920","2094679"," I think I talked to Joe and a couple of the guys about that."
"2094780","2095940"," That's my price targets down here. "
"2096360","2096960"," Somewhere down in here."
"2098140","2105340"," If we have real market crash at any point, I would not be shocked to see us trade down into"
"2105340","2108740"," this zone down here, these 50s and $20."
"2109100","2109860"," I believe it or not. "
"2110660","2111440"," We've seen…"
"2111440","2113800"," I don't know how long you guys have been trading, but I've seen Amazon do it."
"2113940","2114660"," I've seen Apple do it."
"2115060","2116200"," I don't think we get down there. "
"2116620","2118960"," You're talking about a 15% chance that we go that low."
"2120500","2123860"," The potential for us to go that low is very low."
"2125400","2126880"," So where are we right here?"
"2127260","2128500"," I'm going to expect a reaction. "
"2129080","2130440"," We already had one reaction."
"2131340","2134380"," And I want you to see in the past, we've had similar reactions."
"2134760","2135320"," I want you to see this. "
"2136460","2137180"," Follow my cursor."
"2138560","2140920"," I want you to see where we are."
"2141440","2142880"," I want you to…"
"2142880","2144220"," Thank Robbing and Gangster Squad. "
"2144700","2145220"," Right here, right?"
"2145340","2145560"," This bounce."
"2146540","2146960"," Another bounce."
"2147660","2148540"," Big move here, right?"
"2149360","2150380"," I want you to see it right here. "
"2150880","2151940"," One, two, three."
"2152340","2152360"," Boom."
"2152520","2153660"," Big move right there, right?"
"2154260","2156560"," And we've got another one forming down here. "
"2156660","2157060"," We've got one."
"2157580","2162780"," Now, if we get the second bounce here, I'm going to expect this bounce here."
"2162900","2163760"," How long do I think this lasts?"
"2164420","2164900"," Not long. "
"2165420","2167260"," I think this lasts in maybe December."
"2168300","2172020"," And I also think that it's going to be week into March."
"2172480","2173140"," So that's over here. "
"2173900","2176160"," I think we start to sell Tesla once again."
"2176820","2179000"," So this is what I'm looking for."
"2179240","2180400"," So this is what I'm looking for. "
"2180720","2182780"," If we don't get that, right?"
"2182920","2186380"," If you don't get that second bounce on Tesla, so I wouldn't be short here."
"2186400","2187940"," I would be like, yeah, I'm going to open up a short right here cap."
"2188580","2197240"," I would be like, if you want to open up a short right here on Tesla, I would be closing"
"2198610","2201690"," out your shorts somewhere in here today or Monday. "
"2203430","2205190"," I'd be looking to take this long, right?"
"2205530","2209530"," If you want to take another short or say, hey, cap, I'm super bearish on Tesla."
"2210010","2211050"," I don't like anything you're saying."
"2211450","2216010"," You're still looking for some kind of a break, right?"
"2216190","2218850"," Or a break and then we'll bounce up and then we go down. "
"2219430","2219430"," Okay."
"2220230","2221770"," So you're going to want to go out and grab one of these."
"2222030","2228030"," If we start selling immediately, you can grab it anywhere in here and you're going to put a put on"
"2228030","2234010"," some quote, some type or a short on a put on to probably 140 and you're probably going to date"
"2234010","2234910"," it for some time. "
"2235030","2235870"," I would date it."
"2235990","2236970"," I'd put some time on it."
"2237690","2244110"," I'd probably put it for March, but personally, I would put spread for March would be nice probably"
"2244830","2246910"," with like a 140 price target. "
"2247210","2249630"," But you could just go, you know, if you want to go crazy and be like, I'm just going to"
"2249630","2252550"," start fucking hammering the closest expiration date."
"2253130","2254830"," But anything down here is super bearish."
"2254870","2255470"," I want you to know that. "
"2255550","2258230"," I want you to know that this is bullish though for right now."
"2258330","2262170"," I'm looking for this kind of a double bottom and then a slingshot higher."
"2262870","2268910"," My price target above on this trade is probably going to be safe. "
"2269190","2270370"," That is going to be 200 bucks."
"2272070","2278130"," And if I was looking for the bounce, I'm going to have two price targets on a bounce here."
"2278250","2279630"," Okay, there's sellers here. "
"2280230","2281010"," This is 200."
"2282130","2290350"," I'm going to put a if we get if we catch the bounce, it's going to be somewhere in here."
"2292350","2293410"," Yeah, somewhere around that 200. "
"2294070","2297610"," And possibly depending on bullish, it gets I'm going to doubt this."
"2298130","2300530"," This happens, but it's going to be somewhere in here."
"2301770","2302790"," 225 or so. "
"2304410","2309050"," But I think I think I don't think you're going to get that much out of it somewhere in there."
"2309630","2311410"," I think the seller is going to step in here."
"2312170","2317790"," And I think that these I think major sellers are going to step in even above this zone. "
"2318090","2321910"," I think that I think that this is not going to turn this yellow."
"2324230","2325610"," I'm going to turn that red."
"2328270","2331410"," And I am I'm ultimately bearish on Tesla right now. "
"2339090","2341650"," I'll Sellers are actually lower."
"2343930","2344730"," Somewhere in there."
"2345890","2348670"," So I would I would long Tesla today or tomorrow if you want to know. "
"2349410","2350570"," That took forever too."
"2351310","2353870"," It took forever."
"2358290","2361090"," Nice little dough bottom on the spy. "
"2361990","2363150"," Just roll back up Tesla."
"2363710","2366610"," IBM calls me see trading trading thoughts on the ASML."
"2366610","2367590"," I'll write down. "
"2367770","2369050"," I'm going to write down the S."
"2369430","2369890"," Hold on a second."
"2370010","2370510"," I'm missing stuff."
"2372130","2374750"," Well, there you guys get somebody you guys get so much going on. "
"2375750","2377390"," They're going to burn Twitter to the ground."
"2377450","2379230"," Brian sounds like he knows he's near the end."
"2379350","2386270"," Unfortunately, that really sucks but wants I got to check in with him because he's taught me so"
"2386270","2386650"," much. "
"2388110","2389930"," Okay, so Tesla Tesla Tesla, right?"
"2391430","2393650"," Twitter told me to say Walmart looks relatively strong."
"2393910","2394110"," Yep."
"2397050","2398570"," Walmart is relatively strong. "
"2398570","2399550"," We can go and I'll write that."
"2399670","2401190"," I'll do something about Walmart at some point."
"2402110","2403910"," Walmart like I like Walmart. "
"2405510","2406710"," Do we say it's flying?"
"2407450","2408450"," Okay, we'll roll it in."
"2408810","2409010"," We'll see."
"2409170","2409930"," IBM right?"
"2410170","2412330"," I'll write down the IBM IBM thing. "
"2413010","2413970"," We can talk about IBM."
"2414250","2415390"," IBM to ASML."
"2415650","2416370"," I'll write that one down. "
"2419890","2425610"," I'll do I'll do I'll do like charts for you guys for this stuff and post them on Twitter."
"2426170","2427690"," I believe ASK is still in our mission."
"2427990","2428590"," That's good to see. "
"2429090","2433150"," Test the book map I zones looking forward to hearing more about your plans and YouTube landscape"
"2433150","2433530"," tours."
"2433810","2438590"," Yeah, we're going to go into some guru stuff today and the YouTube landscape."
"2438750","2440230"," We'll go through the Twitter landscape too. "
"2440530","2442550"," Have you guys noticed that Twitter is quiet?"
"2443370","2444530"," That's a question for me to you."
"2444690","2445990"," Answer me that in the comments."
"2446970","2450290"," Twitter's been getting quieter and quieter and quieter and quieter. "
"2451470","2452810"," We're going to get the XMS rally."
"2453350","2455830"," Yeah, I yes, I do think we get a Christmas rally."
"2456090","2458930"," I think it's going to be we'll talk about thank robbing gangster squad. "
"2459330","2460970"," We'll talk about a holiday rally."
"2461090","2462630"," I think there's a holiday rally."
"2463190","2472090"," So what I noticed was a lot of traders are putting large flies on the market from 380 to 400. "
"2472690","2482490"," It would not shock me to see a slow retail grind up into the middle of December and maybe"
"2482490","2487330"," the lows around 380 in the highs of 400 and some kind of a trade."
"2487550","2488310"," Let's look at that trade."
"2490410","2491950"," That's a medium term. "
"2493370","2494230"," It would not show."
"2494350","2497050"," Let's look at the quote unquote holiday rally."
"2499910","2503090"," Let's say this is see if we can get right there. "
"2504150","2508750"," It would not shock me to see some kind of a holiday rally."
"2511170","2512470"," This is 400, right?"
"2513190","2514290"," Something like this."
"2517810","2518950"," Yeah, I mean, look at this. "
"2519030","2520870"," I'm already very drawn this out and it matches up."
"2522450","2523670"," Something like this."
"2525110","2529530"," Something where we grind up into this, this wouldn't shock me. "
"2531270","2534770"," And if it only lasts the middle of the month, it'll be right here."
"2535770","2538390"," That goes all over the end of the month, right here."
"2538710","2543110"," And it would be we trade something like this just a slow grind. "
"2543650","2547410"," If we do that, I do recommend call spreads."
"2548510","2554890"," I've gotten caught in holiday rallies where it just grinds options."
"2556530","2557470"," Spreads of your friends. "
"2557750","2564610"," I've seen a ton of traders putting on wide flies, trying to capture all of the trade into mid month"
"2564610","2565170"," and of month."
"2565410","2566650"," So be careful of that as well."
"2567530","2568690"," So do we get a holiday rally?"
"2569010","2569910"," I think it's on the table. "
"2570130","2571370"," I think it's a high probability of it."
"2573430","2574150"," I do."
"2574310","2576070"," I think there's a high probability of a holiday rally. "
"2576390","2577050"," How long it lasts?"
"2578370","2579110"," Not that long."
"2579570","2580590"," I think we do get some sellers."
"2580950","2585990"," I think it lasts into the 15th and then we start selling off into the new year and I think"
"2585990","2586890"," we're going to sell off into March. "
"2587130","2594010"," I think you're going to see that low come in in March or January, March, you'll see a couple of"
"2594010","2594330"," bounces."
"2595770","2597890"," I think that the low though isn't going to be as low."
"2598230","2603510"," You know, when you get when I'm looking at lows, I'm like, it's 3,200, 2,600, 16 or 1 "
"2603510","2603930",",400. "
"2604830","2608790"," Let's look at the let's look at the you could look at this from an Elliott wave perspective."
"2609450","2614630"," If you look at just an Elliott wave and ask an Elliott waiver, what are what are the percentage"
"2614630","2622910"," chances of us trading down to 3,200, 24, 26, and like 14, 600, the percentages go down as we"
"2622910","2624990"," as we trade to those numbers, right?"
"2626230","2628430"," So you have like a 15% chance to go on a 1,400."
"2628710","2633550"," You got a 30% chance to go into 2,400 and you got like a 60, 70% chance"
"2633550","2634170"," to trade at 3,200. "
"2635370","2637210"," So do I think that that that's possible?"
"2637530","2637970"," Yeah, I do."
"2638190","2638650"," I think that's possible."
"2639850","2648710"," And I think that could also kill that that that doom like that Michael Barrie. "
"2648790","2653410"," We're gonna we're gonna sell it down like we did have a housing crisis like we did in 2007."
"2653410","2654850"," You know, no, I want you to know that too."
"2655250","2656310"," That is not the norm. "
"2657910","2659770"," Somehow we're trying to make that the norm."
"2661750","2667430"," Going back to the beginning of the stock market, it's not the norm for us to have a housing crisis"
"2669250","2670670"," every decade or two."
"2671350","2676530"," I know that people are saying that that is going to become the new reality, but it's not the norm. "
"2676750","2678950"," And there's a really simple reason for that."
"2679690","2684110"," The Treasury Department, their job is to make sure that that's not the case."
"2684830","2691270"," Their job is to the Billy Bob and Main Street, his only real investment in count on is his house. "
"2691410","2695010"," Now, I know the housing market's inflated, but they want to protect that."
"2695350","2696950"," There's that last vestige."
"2697750","2704090"," You don't want, you know, the last housing crisis, the president in the Senate was like, no, we're"
"2704090","2705290"," not we're not paying all this money. "
"2705750","2708090"," We're not saving these banks this weekend and we couldn't get it done."
"2708790","2715430"," And the Senate was like in Larry, whatever his name is, they were like, if you don't do this, we're"
"2715430","2718450"," not gonna make payroll checks for Walmart and McDonald's workers."
"2719810","2726050"," And it was really it was really a weekend where it was really a weekend where you could have riots"
"2726050","2726570"," in the streets. "
"2727170","2731010"," You're talking about people with paycheck paycheck, millions and millions."
"2731270","2735850"," Some of you guys live in like one place your whole lives, but talking about a vast percentage of"
"2735850","2745570"," the population that in terms of domestic security for the nation, so just like contemplating that"
"2745570","2749050"," that's going to be the norm, they will turn QE on before he gets to that point."
"2749190","2749690"," I promise you. "
"2749970","2753730"," So when you're listening to these guys out there saying that that's going to be the new norm,"
"2753730","2755390"," that's fucking pure insanity."
"2755810","2756510"," They're not American."
"2757210","2762590"," We promise you right now that our government's not going to want to allow it to happen. "
"2762730","2764410"," You don't want to see that kind of blood in the streets."
"2765070","2768250"," And so to say that's going to be the norm in this country right now on, I think we're going"
"2768250","2771350"," to we'll do anything we can possibly to not allow that to happen."
"2771950","2776130"," So you just keep that in the back of your mind when you're talking about like, we're going to trade"
"2776130","2778490"," down the depths of hell tomorrow kind of stuff. "
"2780750","2785370"," Just keep that that's not the norm for the for the greatest country in the entire world."
"2785510","2785770"," Period."
"2785990","2786530"," End of story. "
"2788010","2788710"," That's the truth."
"2789290","2790710"," We run the world market."
"2791190","2795930"," So I'm highly doubting that that continues to happen every decade or two. "
"2797910","2800010"," Anyways, long story short of that bullshit."
"2800870","2803970"," So think about like think about like where do we trade down to?"
"2804310","2806190"," What's the logical place for us to trade down to?"
"2806590","2807030"," 3200."
"2807490","2808050"," Does that happen?"
"2808330","2809050"," Then what do we do?"
"2809050","2810130"," We start to have a blow off top. "
"2810590","2811310"," It's not point."
"2811690","2818570"," I want you to think about the reality of where you think we're going to trade to versus the doom"
"2818570","2818950"," fetish."
"2819850","2824570"," And what the reality of that doom fetish is if we do trade down, let's say we do trade down"
"2824570","2829090"," like 1400 like three months or six months or something insane like that. "
"2829830","2835750"," You're talking about the some guy who lives like next door to you not like not being able to rent"
"2835750","2842430"," his house or not being able to put gas in his car to bring his grandmother to the hospital that"
"2842430","2843030"," next day."
"2843410","2846410"," These people make like 300 bucks 700 bucks a week."
"2847570","2853090"," Some of some of the doom anarchy stuff that I see from people I'm like this is insane. "
"2853630","2858530"," What you're asking for to happen every couple of decades every decade every couple of decades."
"2859350","2864970"," And to be honest with you, the government will do whatever it can to not let that happen."
"2865450","2871450"," And you're talking about wanting to put the United States at risk of being a fourth or fifth world"
"2871450","2872910"," country every decade or two. "
"2873290","2874350"," And it's just mind blowing."
"2875090","2876650"," I get the whole reset thing."
"2877930","2883470"," But this is why when we had the housing crisis, they stepped in the way that they did at that"
"2883470","2887730"," moment because the danger to the security of the United States of America. "
"2887730","2888990"," So I just want you to be aware of that."
"2889030","2890290"," Okay, just keep that in the back of your mind."
"2891830","2893510"," We're going to see cap. "
"2893610","2894550"," We're going to get the extra sets."
"2894670","2895010"," I did the exercise."
"2895710","2897230"," Tell me what the YouTube group is abrupt. "
"2898110","2902170"," First, there's methods where you don't look at like your Twitter profile photo at all."
"2902530","2903050"," My head hurts."
"2903990","2905390"," Yeah, no, I'm a normal guy. "
"2906990","2911110"," Chas and just so that some of you guys out there know I've been doing my pushups."
"2911510","2914330"," And when I'm not doing my pushups, I'm rebuilding a house that I bought."
"2915910","2919230"," So I'm going to even probably even look a little bit different than what I have in the past. "
"2922390","2923630"," Good to see you Stocks Anonymous."
"2926110","2926850"," Let me see here."
"2927050","2927990"," What are you guys doing here?"
"2928270","2930630"," Let's see you guys doing Mr. Two Stocks Anonymous. "
"2932410","2934150"," Miss to Robert, good to see you in here."

"2941090","2941630"," Let me go back."
"2941790","2942550"," Let me go back to the screen."
"2942550","2944230"," Back in the one day screen here. "
"2947350","2949710"," To the buyers in here trying to hold it up here, right?"
"2950510","2952050"," We're bouncing around inside."
"2952310","2957790"," I will switch back over real quick to book map and show you book map and just bouncing around in"
"2957790","2958130"," here, right?"
"2958290","2959610"," You guys can see us bouncing around."
"2960450","2964210"," I guess it's just bouncing around here, trying to come up to this cell zone here. "
"2964210","2967230"," We've got sellers that are here wanting to want to take over."
"2967230","2968730"," We're coming into the VWAP as well."
"2969110","2971310"," We want to see if you can break through VWAP, take this trade higher. "
"2972150","2975430"," If you want to take a trade here, I'm going to switch back over."
"2976110","2981910"," I want to show you if you want to take a trade here, you want to take a long trade"
"2981910","2982890"," here as a bull."
"2984370","2989270"," You want to see, you want to pick up this trade, you guys want to see what I do?"
"2990090","2991830"," I'm talking to you guys on Twitter. "
"2992870","2993890"," What am I looking for?"
"2994050","2996370"," I got the one bounce, two bounce, right?"
"2997050","3000730"," I want to see that third bounce and then what do I want to pick it up right here?"
"3001670","3003050"," That's where I want to pick that trade up."
"3003210","3004590"," We're somewhere up in here."
"3005570","3010970"," I want to see that third bounce and then I'm going to go on Twitter and say, I'm long, 393Cs"
"3010970","3013710"," and I'm going to take this trade up higher, right?"
"3014150","3015990"," You see this blue line coming down right here?"
"3016750","3018410"," I'm going to see some resistance above here. "
"3018510","3020670"," It's a quick 20-point trade, right?"
"3021050","3021670"," Right up in here."
"3022670","3024790"," Hopefully get an extension, come back down."
"3025050","3026670"," Actually, let me make that better. "
"3027310","3029490"," This is a little bull line coming down right here."
"3030090","3031570"," What do I want to see, right?"
"3032470","3037250"," I want to take this trade, bam, up here, get out of the trade, re-enter it again and take"
"3037250","3038470"," the next leg up, right?"
"3039310","3040270"," That's kind of what I want to be doing."
"3043370","3044770"," We're going to keep our eyes open here. "
"3044990","3045870"," I'll leave it on BookMap."
"3046090","3049510"," If you guys want to take that trade, I want to put it on BookMap as I keep talking so"
"3049510","3051150"," you guys can see what happens up here."
"3052910","3055170"," Let me see, could you even stretch down these 70s?"
"3055230","3055590"," You want to?"
"3055970","3064810"," Less bots, Twitter's being super active, fire, fire my feed, ready to resist, explode it all over,"
"3065030","3067250"," good, bad, never public, but diverse, like more, like life. "
"3067750","3072270"," You know David, the one thing I've noticed on Twitter is that my feed has become more accurate."
"3073470","3074810"," I will give you that."
"3075010","3078510"," I've seen more accurate trading posts. "
"3079410","3087170"," I'm shocked when I see now, I'm seeing more people that are on the same page,"
"3087690","3091310"," not just talking crazy."
"3091790","3092810"," I will say that."
"3094830","3098830"," Yeah, your Twitter feed got quite once I muted certain words like FTX. "
"3098990","3100070"," I need to do that by the way."
"3102890","3106510"," Treasury buying MBS up until March was off inflation of home price."
"3107010","3107590"," I agree with that. "
"3108910","3109890"," I agree with that."
"3110950","3113910"," Something over buying or buying bonds and mortgages."
"3113910","3114770"," Nope, it is not. "
"3116010","3117890"," There's a reason for that though in the background, Willie."
"3118350","3119290"," I'll go into it briefly."
"3119910","3126210"," So the mortgage backed securities industry was going to crash. "
"3126530","3132570"," Matter of fact, Canada was going to crash earlier than the US and those traders point blank set if"
"3132570","3133730"," they didn't support that market."
"3134310","3135430"," That's where the crash was coming in."
"3135730","3136810"," That goes back to my last conversation. "
"3137610","3142250"," They didn't, you know, it's funny too because the Treasury Department and the Fed never once wanted"
"3142250","3143250"," to even discuss it."
"3143850","3146630"," And there are those traders on on fin to it."
"3146950","3148350"," If you can go seek those guys out. "
"3148810","3156770"," And when they were talking about stopping to buy a debt corporate debt, they never wanted to bring"
"3156770","3160350"," up especially commercial mortgage backed securities."
"3161210","3162310"," There was no discussion about it."
"3162350","3163490"," It was like quiet in the back of the room. "
"3163670","3164610"," Nobody wanted to discuss it."
"3164610","3166290"," You can hear about it in the news at all."
"3166550","3170830"," And the reason was because that's where at that time, I don't know when this I think I want to"
"3170830","3173470"," say this was summer or coming into summer. "
"3174230","3175890"," That's where the bears wanted to crash."
"3175990","3177450"," They wanted to give them a gloom to come in."
"3177670","3179270"," And of course, they supported that market. "
"3180430","3181310"," Jimmy's almost done."
"3181910","3185610"," I've got so the Jimmy's five floors, five stories tall."
"3185870","3187710"," I'm down to a story and a half right now. "
"3188050","3188730"," It's all I got left."
"3190630","3191830"," I do look bitter."
"3192550","3193370"," Great to hear a lot. "
"3193590","3195150"," I see all you guys out here in the chat."
"3195590","3197310"," Been since May six months since live stream."
"3197470","3197710"," Well, yeah. "
"3199390","3200470"," Yeah, I got to cut my hair."
"3201270","3204070"," Wasn't the last 393 stopped out for one penny loss."
"3204510","3204570"," Yeah. "
"3205150","3206870"," So yesterday got stopped out twice."
"3207410","3211230"," Took the trade again, but I did get stopped out for a penny the moment it started ripping."
"3211350","3214630"," Had I stayed in that trade, I would have made like 400% or something. "
"3214810","3216170"," I was kind of pissy about that trade yesterday."
"3217770","3219750"," Does the market still want to go lower today?"
"3220590","3221190"," It does."
"3221850","3222750"," The market does. "
"3222970","3225590"," So I'm going to give you my who's asking Jose."
"3226650","3232470"," I want the market to go down to what did I say it was 390."
"3232930","3236050"," I want to buy 390 to 395 by Monday. "
"3237530","3244690"," There is some squeezing that could happen of course today because of puts that puts that in the"
"3244690","3248910"," money that that could as they we can in their expiry to create squeezes."
"3249350","3254710"," Custom upside target zone turned DNA pull one three zero likely determines the reverse bridge"

"3255890","3257110"," I agree with that Bessqua. "
"3258770","3264930"," My bias with we with LT possible targets down to 35 70 34 30 20 agree with all those targets"
"3264930","3265330"," as well."
"3265490","3266710"," I'm on the same page as a Bessqua."
"3268930","3270810"," Less derivatives of other people's content. "
"3271110","3271590"," I agree with that."
"3272070","3272750"," Willy smoked me."
"3273350","3275910"," Canada is all there belongs that there's that's their structural fault. "
"3275910","3276290"," I agree."

"3278630","3279670"," So happy to see back. "
"3280130","3283030"," Spain today building by limits and positions for diagonals in the next week."
"3283290","3283650"," Oh yes."
"3284790","3287090"," This is the scroll back up missing some of what you guys are asking. "
"3289930","3290290"," See."
"3290670","3290890"," All right."
"3290990","3292050"," So everybody is here for that. "
"3292170","3292230"," Right?"
"3294790","3295150"," Yeah."
"3295270","3296710"," So I'll be looking to take along here."
"3296910","3297830"," I want to take along. "
"3298270","3301050"," If we can get right above here, I'll take along."
"3301330","3302590"," We can get right above Vwap here."
"3302990","3303650"," I'll take along. "
"3303650","3305450"," I'd like to take this long ramp in here."
"3305750","3306430"," If I could."
"3306870","3307490"," That's 396. "
"3309310","3310250"," We got above."
"3310610","3310890"," We've got."
"3313480","3313880"," Yeah. "
"3313940","3314260"," I'll take that."
"3314400","3315940"," I'd actually take that trade rate to 4000."
"3318040","3319560"," Take that trade rate to 4000. "
"3323700","3324100"," Yeah."
"3324220","3324660"," Pinky's asking."
"3326900","3328720"," Are we going to be able to live stream more?"
"3328820","3329020"," Yes. "
"3329320","3329900"," So here's the deal."
"3330140","3330700"," So this summer."
"3331400","3331800"," All right. "
"3332240","3333140"," And then this summer."
"3334080","3336120"," Well, I was I was falling behind and."
"3336740","3339120"," No, we say we started to absolutely accept. "
"3339340","3339780"," Botta house."
"3339920","3340040"," Okay."
"3341060","3345980"," And I had a construction plan. "
"3346840","3350680"," And this construction plan was like 50 grand."
"3352420","3353480"," And then."
"3354360","3355260"," What is it here?"
"3357830","3359990"," And then we had a COVID happening and. "
"3359990","3362890"," And it's it started to balloon."
"3363330","3365390"," Like I updated the plan that went to like $100,000."
"3365690","3366930"," That went to like $125,000. "
"3367730","3368970"," Really $150,000."
"3369330","3370510"," And I was like, this is fucking crazy."
"3371410","3373870"," And that's as inflation really started ramping and kicking in. "
"3374010","3376110"," And then I was watching the housing market, of course, is going down."
"3376870","3379350"," And I'm like, I'm going to get fucked on this eight-way sideways."
"3380730","3381870"," So I was like, I'll do it myself. "
"3382690","3386370"," So I was streaming into last spring, into early summer."
"3386670","3389310"," And I was like, I'll save a bunch of money."
"3389790","3390850"," I was like, I really haven't built. "
"3391090","3394470"," I did one rehab, just myself when I first started rehab in houses."
"3395010","3397310"," But since then I've subbed all that stuff out."
"3397490","3399190"," So I'm like, I'm going to build this house myself. "
"3399830","3404590"," Kind of like buying an old city car, old truck, and making it your own."
"3405950","3409650"," And so this summer I had a bunch of work to do to get this house ready for."
"3409890","3411710"," Well, first I wanted to move my family into it. "
"3413050","3418150"," And I wanted to get it like the electric on the water on heat on all this nonsense windows."
"3418210","3422930"," This house had some windows, didn't have other windows, all kinds of nonsense."
"3423350","3426310"," And so I ended up moving, ended up rehabbing the basement. "
"3427050","3428330"," I made an office, this is a new office."
"3430150","3431270"," I made an office for my wife."
"3431710","3434370"," She's an athletic trainer and she works remote. "
"3435310","3436310"," So I had to make her an office."
"3436530","3439170"," I homeschool my kids and I make them an office."
"3439550","3443650"," And then I had to put in a temporary kitchen and living room and bedrooms all kind of nonsense. "
"3444830","3449110"," And so I've done all that to this point, ran electricity."
"3449910","3452670"," And I did have had some demo work to do heading into the end of summer."
"3453290","3455650"," And I had this big long list of shit I had to do. "
"3455950","3458970"," And it just kept, it just like longer and longer."
"3459290","3459810"," So I'm there."
"3460050","3466890"," I'm done now to, I'm done to a point where all the hard heavy dirty work is, I've got a"
"3466890","3468950"," four and a half of chimney to remove. "
"3469410","3470290"," And then that's the hard work."
"3470810","3475710"," Other than that, I can stream and then I can go run some wire at nighttime where I can put"
"3475710","3480990"," some pipe in or do some tire work, but all like the brutal stuff, the stuff that's just not"
"3480990","3482930"," conducive at all to streaming is done."
"3484610","3488350"," So I am able to start streaming again on a regular basis. "
"3489750","3499540"," You're going to get for me now, let's talk about the state of, so we're still looking to see if"
"3499540","3502100"," this is going to move up or not, right?"
"3502960","3510300"," So we're going to talk about the state real quick of, so when I was streaming, my problem was I'm"
"3510300","3511120"," not getting paid for this."
"3512460","3516160"," I was approached by a lot of people, some people with great intentions, but then there's a whole"
"3516160","3519480"," other group that are like, well, we're going to get you a bunch of followers and we're going to"
"3520260","3527380"," start sound classes and we're going to start fucking promoting FTX and shit like that and that FXI"
"3527380","3529760"," and DXY and whatever, you know what I mean?"
"3529840","3533940"," It's just nonstop, promote gambling, do all this stuff."
"3534660","3537900"," And to be honest, I'm not that person anymore in my life. "
"3538000","3540140"," I'm not looking to make a business out of this or whatever."
"3541000","3543300"," Now it's not, also not paying for me for my time."
"3543440","3545800"," It's taking a lot of time to do this, like all the research and stuff. "
"3546560","3550160"," So what I'm going to do, what is what I'm going to try to do is in that now looking,"
"3550920","3554620"," we all know this about pumpers and stock pumpers, a lot of kind of stuff out there in YouTube world"
"3554620","3559780"," and YouTube land and Twitter land and TikTok and DikTok and all that kind of stuff."
"3559900","3562660"," So here's my plan is it's going to be free."
"3562780","3564720"," It's not, I'm not going to do anything but free. "
"3566060","3570200"," So it's going to just be, I'm going to set up a subscriber kind of a thing."
"3570960","3573380"," Another mine to pay, well, you guys are going to start to get again."
"3573700","3574560"," So this is what you're going to get for me. "
"3575280","3579620"," You're going to get from me, I'm going to start posting again the levels every day for you."
"3579820","3584800"," All that information that I was often going to start seeing that feed get back going for you."
"3586260","3594740"," You're going to get, you're going to get, sorry, you're going to get the levels every single day"
"3594740","3595040"," for me. "
"3595340","3597300"," You're going to get a newsletter from me."
"3598100","3599740"," I think it's once a week."
"3599920","3601800"," There's all the stuff written down that I'm having from me. "
"3601860","3603100"," You're going to get a newsletter from me though."
"3604260","3605300"," That's at least once a week."
"3606420","3612840"," It's going to give you at least a rolling update on short, medium and long term so I would expect"
"3612840","3614480"," the market to do so you guys can plan it. "
"3614500","3618500"," It'll give you squeeze trades on individual tickers, all that kind of shit."
"3619120","3621020"," You're going to get that once a week, once a month for me."
"3621840","3625020"," And then you're going to get live streams from me every day. "
"3625860","3629720"," Now the live streams, we're going to focus more."
"3630180","3633580"," I was doing just the live streams with book map playing constantly at all times."
"3634060","3634740"," I'm not going to do that anymore. "
"3634940","3643320"," We're going to switch but we're going to trade with charts."
"3643780","3653460"," I'm going to teach you guys how to chart properly and how to go went to buy"
"3653460","3654140"," and conjunction."
"3654820","3658840"," I'm going to show you guys how to get book map for free if you don't already know. "
"3659360","3660680"," Maybe some of you guys know or don't know."
"3661460","3663480"," I'm going to talk to you guys about getting book map free."
"3664920","3670000"," We're going to trade the market based on some fundamental TA. "
"3670400","3675460"," We're going to be looking at why is the VIX going up?"
"3675560","3677860"," Why is the VIX not going up?"
"3678180","3679800"," Why is HYG going up?"
"3679920","3680380"," Why is it not?"
"3680580","3680980"," That kind of stuff."
"3681560","3685680"," Why is Dixie correlating and not correlating?"
"3685800","3686500"," Why is there divergence?"
"3687080","3691560"," So you guys know where the market's actually going before it goes there because I'm kind of tired"
"3691560","3695280"," of seeing people getting fucked up in the market."
"3696600","3699100"," So we're going to change the format slightly. "
"3699400","3706240"," Now on top of all that you're going to also get more interviews on this show."
"3707140","3714300"," So I'm able to do interviews now and so you're going to get like you'll see like the charts up"
"3714300","3719640"," or book map will be up and you're also going to see me talking to people and some of it's"
"3719640","3720760"," going to be market related."
"3721500","3730230"," I've been writing this this outline for questions for people and they'll get them prior to the"
"3730230","3730510"," interview. "
"3731390","3735930"," Some of it will be market related depending on what they want to talk about if they want to have"
"3735930","3737690"," with their trade styles or how they trade."
"3738890","3743710"," But some of it's just going to be about the soap opera that's our market or how they got into"
"3743710","3744850"," trading stuff like that."
"3744990","3748550"," So you guys can have me on and do what you're doing out there. "
"3748630","3753690"," If you're like hey I'm fading on my own but I want to have any commentary I want to hear."
"3755650","3762330"," Something that's not, when I listen to these guys on YouTube oftentimes they're either pompous"
"3762330","3771790"," assholes, no offense, or they're trading something that you're not trading or in the context of"
"3771790","3777210"," your trading, they're professionals where they're just not in the trades."
"3777490","3780050"," They're not going to update you day in, day out and that kind of stuff. "
"3780690","3785950"," And then there's like the other, we're just day trading right, we're just taking level to level."
"3786270","3791470"," I think it's going to be a mix of we're day trading, the live streams and then having someone"
"3791470","3798090"," something in the background that's a little bit more light, a little bit more, I don't want to call"
"3798090","3807990"," it like maybe old school Joe Rogan to an extent, not new school Joe Rogan"
"3807990","3810350"," but more like old school anymore."
"3810490","3813610"," I used to be because he would ask people questions and they would just go off and talk and you"
"3813610","3818350"," could listen to a conversation for an hour or two hours while you're off doing your own thing. "
"3818870","3823330"," Now he talks too much and I talk too much so I want to give somebody else the opportunity to"
"3823330","3826030"," do some talking and switch it up day in day out."
"3826270","3830750"," So I've got a bunch of questions for people, I'll send them to them in advance and we'll try to"
"3830750","3836210"," get people, if we can get regulars to stop in once a day, once a week or once every two"
"3836210","3840370"," weeks and have some, I've got some, a lot of you guys are funny as fuck too, I know you"
"3840370","3845730"," guys outside of Twitter and you guys are hilarious so we can have regular conversations, we can"
"3845730","3850270"," talk about soap opera, that's the stock market, we can have like some prime things, we can talk"
"3850270","3854670"," about Elon Musk right now right, we can talk about Sam and his sex tape right now, we got all"
"3854670","3860370"," kinds of crazy shit we can talk about day in day out there stuff to talk about."
"3860490","3865690"," Then we can talk about more technical stuff, every day we'll talk about the news as well and its"
"3865690","3870070"," impact on the markets of course, but we're going to get right back in the swing of things and we're"
"3870070","3872790"," going to add, we're going to add some more to this program. "
"3875630","3880370"," I think at one time I was a fan of all those guys, I used to like someone's asking about,"
"3880370","3881650"," someone's asking about Lex Friedman."
"3882330","3888050"," You know what I like about Joe Rogan at one point was he brought all kinds of different people on"
"3888050","3892330"," with different kinds of backgrounds and he let those people talk and then you'd move on to"
"3892330","3892810"," something else."
"3893530","3898410"," What I don't like about Joe Rogan now is like when he brings on a guy talking about aliens, he's"
"3898410","3898990"," believing in aliens. "
"3899250","3903370"," I don't care if Joe Rogan believes in aliens or not, I just want to hear that alien story and"
"3903370","3909270"," then move on to the next person that's talking about jokes or talking about social sciences or"
"3909270","3916350"," talking about the VIX and why it matters you know, different topics every day."
"3916990","3919030"," I want to hear them talk and then move on to the next one."
"3919850","3924590"," I don't know if that's, if I'm relating that properly. "
"3927530","3929510"," Yeah, we got a rejection there, huh, and yes."
"3930850","3932510"," You guys seeing that rejection there?"
"3934640","3937260"," Let's take a look at, let's switch it over."
"3938860","3939820"," Let's go to the mainstream. "
"3941040","3941880"," Weak buyers, right?"
"3942260","3944860"," You can see right here, weak buyers, we didn't get above."
"3945240","3949340"," I talked to you a few moments ago and said to you, where do I want to buy this?"
"3949480","3953360"," And I said, I want to buy this when it comes up and take that trade higher, right?"
"3953580","3954300"," We didn't get that."
"3954520","3954760"," We did. "
"3954900","3955560"," We got rejection."
"3956640","3958040"," We wound up switching out."
"3958240","3960560"," We ended up not getting what we wanted, right?"
"3960700","3964160"," So you guys want to know when and why I did or didn't take a trade. "
"3964900","3966260"," On Twitter, you guys are always asking me."
"3966360","3968040"," That's why I didn't take that trade, right?"
"3968680","3969640"," To be rejected here."
"3971040","3971360"," Not good. "
"3971540","3972360"," Not a good look, right?"
"3972680","3973420"," Weakness in the market."
"3976560","3977340"," Weak buyers."
"3979440","3981840"," Let me know in the chat if you would buy this right here. "
"3982200","3984280"," I'll switch back over so you can see it on BookMap."
"3985360","3986420"," Would you buy this?"
"3986640","3989560"," You can see over here these buyers stepped in down below."
"3991380","3992700"," They're still weak to me. "
"3993840","3995320"," I'm not happy with it with this."
"3995460","3997600"," I'm not bullish on this market today."
"3998220","3999600"," I told you guys that already. "
"4003080","4006360"," Yeah, there's still still more sellers than buyers right now."
"4006360","4008080"," Still lots of sellers in the market."
"4009680","4014680"," So my price target is down below, let's say down below on the clothes today. "
"4015460","4017680"," Let's see, get some squeezes from closing up puts."
"4018520","4021740"," My target down below is still going to be right here."
"4024180","4026220"," Target is going to be somewhere down below. "
"4026520","4028240"," That is right there."
"4029560","4031060"," Right down here to this 390."
"4032820","4034900"," That's my price targeting to the bell today. "
"4035360","4036180"," Hopefully we can get that."
"4036540","4039340"," I do want you to see that we are now below the VWAP."
"4039440","4041760"," This orange line here is VWAP. "
"4042100","4043440"," See how I'm going to highlight it here?"
"4044480","4045400"," That's VWAP, right?"
"4045560","4047040"," We've traded below VWAP now."
"4047780","4048820"," And what are you looking for?"
"4048980","4052520"," If you're a bull or a bear, if you're just a trader, what are you looking for?"
"4052660","4056220"," You're looking for the trade below the VWAP, right?"
"4056560","4059120"," A rejection off VWAP."
"4059620","4063060"," Maybe one more pump and then a move lower. "
"4064180","4065960"," So that's what you're looking for at this point."
"4066680","4069800"," We are very bearish here at this point on spy."
"4071700","4073460"," And so we want to see, we want to see that rejection. "
"4073460","4077200"," I want to see the bears hold on here and trade this down into the bell."
"4079980","4080900"," It sucks, man."
"4081020","4083080"," I haven't taken a trade take over here talking to you guys. "
"4083560","4084620"," That's the other thing too."
"4084960","4086680"," It's hard for me to trade when I'm talking to you guys."
"4090100","4093500"," It's hard for me to take a trade when I'm on here doing live streams with you guys. "
"4093660","4094700"," I forgot about that."
"4099600","4101340"," Let me get a bright pull along here."
"4102100","4103100"," That's what I'm saying, long here. "
"4103859","4105140"," Test came in, what was it?"
"4105800","4108800"," Fan it like speedman, another dip in the ass coming, big block of orders."
"4108800","4109800"," Will it hold?"
"4110020","4114580"," Would you rather go for 10 spy instead of the one SPX?"
"4114960","4116540"," I like trading SPX."
"4117260","4125580"," I like tax advantages of it, but I don't take Carlina's asking what you can trade SPX along with"
"4125580","4125779"," me. "
"4125779","4127020"," You can trade SPX."
"4127340","4128000"," I like SPX."
"4128279","4131720"," I like, I don't mind SPX contracts or tax advantages to that. "
"4132260","4137460"," I don't take many, I trade with stocks."
"4137840","4140720"," I trade SPX with stocks all the time."
"4141080","4141479"," I used to. "
"4142319","4146620"," I don't trade it now because when I trade the spy, I'm trading just calls."
"4146979","4149300"," They're built to pay a lot of money fast."
"4150080","4152819"," I'm trading it directionally quickly. "
"4153500","4154080"," Here's an example."
"4154979","4155720"," This is a good thing to talk about."
"4156359","4162720"," This move right here, if you were to trade this move, with puts, right?"
"4165420","4169520"," If we fuck around in here or bounce back up in here, you're going to lose your money. "
"4170120","4171200"," Puts pay one to one."
"4172180","4177700"," They don't pay as well as calls do for me when I'm trading them."
"4177859","4185479"," If I was trading SPX on a short, excuse me, SPX puts, I would trade puts on SPX, but not"
"4185479","4186760"," on the spy. "
"4186760","4192040"," I need calls are built to print that money quickly."
"4192600","4195000"," It's like 20, 30, 40, 50, 100%."
"4195500","4197400"," And they hold their value longer than puts do. "
"4197720","4204080"," If you guys watch just the options chain, options chain, you'll notice that puts, you really need"
"4204080","4206400"," to like diamond-hand them for a long, long time."
"4206660","4207780"," So we're heading down now."
"4208580","4210120"," We're going to take a look. "
"4210440","4211260"," We're going to switch over a quick."
"4211260","4217940"," So no, I trade, I trade spy calls and puts."
"4218120","4218680"," That's what I trade. "
"4219360","4220800"," And we're going to take a look real quick."
"4221760","4222640"," But you don't have to."
"4222680","4223680"," You can trade what the fuck you want. "
"4224080","4225360"," You can follow along against those trades."
"4225860","4227780"," So we're sitting here on some support right now."
"4228400","4229700"," Some buyers are stepping in. "
"4231320","4232360"," They are kind of weak."
"4232500","4233320"," I'm going to be honest with you."
"4233420","4237740"," We're looking to break through here and start trade, take this lower price target down below. "
"4238760","4240420"," Let's take a look at the price target down below."
"4252050","4254070"," Yeah, 3,900 is the price target down below."
"4254190","4254650"," I promise you. "
"4260290","4260990"," 3,900."
"4261370","4265950"," I'm not guaranteeing it, but I'm going to give it like a, I'm going to give it like a 75 "
"4265950","4268230","% chance that we're going to see 3,900."
"4269630","4274750"," Almost three, almost, I'll leave book map up so you guys can, if you guys want to take some, take"
"4274750","4279630"," some winnings off here, take some money off top and then reenter for below here. "
"4281150","4282890"," So we'll switch over real quick."
"4283070","4283650"," I'll show you guys."
"4283650","4289070"," If you guys want to be right in here. "
"4290410","4293770"," So this orange box right here, you want to take some money off."
"4295390","4299050"," Then you want to, then you want to look for the next short to go even lower."
"4299430","4303670"," You want to see a rejection up in here somewhere for the next, the next leg lower. "
"4308810","4313030"," So we'll leave that one on and we'll put that one right about there."
"4313310","4314910"," Now we'll go back to book map for you."
"4317680","4319620"," This came with four cents or a new low. "
"4320300","4322200"," The sex tape was, was delayed."
"4322620","4323980"," I haven't checked you out for the sex tape."
"4324600","4326640"," Tesla came within four cents of a new low. "
"4326960","4327880"," Oh, is it really?"
"4328260","4328960"," Let me check right now."
"4330840","4332180"," 178, 55."
"4334340","4334600"," And Tesla?"
"4335600","4336220"," That below. "
"4338470","4339650"," Did it break the new low yet?"
"4343120","4343600"," Oh, look here."
"4346020","4348640"," No, so previous low is what I'm looking right now."
"4351180","4353720"," Previous low is 174, flat. "
"4356830","4359450"," What you really want to see is what you want to see 174 get broken."
"4362340","4363100"," Let's see here."
"4363360","4365980"," Let's take a look around, let me take a look around and see what we're doing. "
"4369160","4372420"," Let's see, let's see."
"4374700","4375760"," The H5G is still weak."
"4379810","4381550"," The VIX looks like it wants to fucking rip. "
"4384360","4385560"," Yeah, we're going to start selling."
"4386560","4392730"," Let me go back over here for you guys so you can see."
"4394350","4396130"," You guys can see this right here. "
"4396490","4398810"," Getting a little bit of a bounce right here in the Sarned box."
"4399650","4403470"," We're looking for a rejection for continued further move down."
"4403730","4404930"," We want to see something like this. "
"4407410","4410270"," And re-enter a short or a put right up here."
"4411230","4412210"," That's what I'm looking for."
"4413450","4418630"," If we trade up here, if we trade up here, I'll buy some puts. "
"4420290","4428870"," As a matter of fact, let me get set up so I can buy some puts here."
"4438580","4439740"," Just a second here."
"4446660","4451820"," I got 150,000 calls on 397c, 44 cents. "
"4455180","4455940"," Damn."
"4457200","4458480"," Just getting torched."
"4460280","4466080"," 390, 390 keys or 16 cents. "
"4466360","4467120"," I don't like that trade."
"4468220","4468860"," Too far out of the money."
"4470840","4471580"," 392s I like. "
"4471740","4472960"," Those are 44 cents."
"4477020","4477760"," I like those."
"4480060","4480940"," Good jeez. "
"4485980","4486860"," Hold on."
"4486940","4488000"," I'm looking at some other stuff here."
"4493660","4495140"," You switch back over for you. "
"4495620","4495940"," Book map."
"4501080","4502780"," Let's see if we can find any kind of a bottom here."
"4506780","4509500"," Or if I have ideas, we're trying to test it down. "
"4510540","4511560"," Kind of goofing now."
"4512500","4514440"," Tesla 176, Red Pole."
"4514740","4517040"," Oh, I missed a bunch of you guys saying. "
"4518520","4520380"," This one's a Red Pole long here."
"4520820","4520900"," Exactly."
"4521140","4522740"," Joe is good before you learn to call his guests. "
"4523440","4524120"," He's the flip them."
"4524840","4525920"," No big green balls."
"4526360","4528220"," No big green balls, Binky, right?"
"4529080","4529300"," It's weak. "
"4529940","4530440"," Kyle says it's weak."
"4530660","4530900"," I agree."
"4531960","4532540"," It's weak. "
"4532860","4533260"," It's not."
"4533540","4535920"," This is not bullish, if you want to know."
"4538340","4539700"," No big green balls agreed. "
"4540020","4544620"," So this is overall bearish than those SPX options, for example, are going to be profitable."
"4544620","4546220"," Isn't that bad for market makers?"
"4546800","4549820"," No, so that's a good question, Roy."
"4550720","4556740"," So there's trillions of dollars in unrealized. "
"4557100","4563960"," There's a different word for it, but there's a five by an SPX option for $10."
"4564820","4568540"," And today it expires at a dollar, right?"
"4570200","4579750"," Or even $3 as a dealer, as a dealer that they haven't expired in the money, let's say, right?"
"4579950","4581930"," If they were 10 bucks, they didn't expire at $20."
"4586510","4588870"," Bear, so those are the things that they're going to be profitable. "
"4589190","4591310"," No, those are not profitable."
"4591550","4592310"," They're profitable spreads."
"4592690","4593050"," That's about it. "
"4594050","4594970"," What else are you saying?"
"4600140","4603260"," $3.95, $50, maybe adding another short."
"4607420","4611100"," Capital always, this common trading, the emotions are constantly getting the best of me."
"4612560","4613480"," Yeah, I freak out. "
"4613620","4614920"," You guys will see me freak out on stream."
"4615420","4616580"," There's nothing much trade at all."
"4616720","4617000"," He has nothing. "
"4617300","4620060"," There's so much job and trade for you."
"4620980","4621820"," Yeah, I could do that too."
"4622500","4622660"," I couldn't break. "
"4622800","4623920"," Let's see how it plays out, Roy."
"4624880","4626380"," He's exactly to see you."
"4627080","4628140"," Very bullish and grinder. "
"4628140","4629420"," It's inherently all of it."
"4630400","4631320"," Things like that."
"4631700","4634440"," Hey, Carlino, M's don't want us. "
"4634540","4635600"," It's supposed to be worth anything right."
"4638040","4642820"," So, yes, by close, they want all options to be worthless."
"4643420","4648140"," So you'll see, I wish I had an option to show you. "
"4648280","4655600"," So by close, they want the majority of options to expire worthless."
"4655600","4662940"," And then the ones that do expire with some value on them, they're typically tied to spreads,"
"4663600","4668060"," butterflies, out there, any kind of spread."
"4669900","4671260"," Spread spreads, debit spreads. "
"4672640","4676800"," Actually, they can change in value two after four p.m. Between four and six p.m. There can be"
"4676800","4678860"," some pecky pecky going on there."
"4680060","4680780"," But like a dealer."
"4681320","4683880"," So if a dealer, let's say me, I'm a trader, right?"
"4685500","4693700"," So I take a trade where I buy a spy 400c, expiring today, right?"
"4694860","4696940"," And let's say it's, I don't know, 10 cents. "
"4697440","4699560"," And if it goes to 400, it's going to be a dollar."
"4700460","4703020"," The dealer has to take the opposite side of that trade, right?"
"4703980","4705480"," So they either have to sell stock."
"4706540","4707920"," So it doesn't go to that. "
"4708300","4709540"," It doesn't print that hundred bucks."
"4710500","4711460"," Does that say that right?"
"4711460","4713060"," Yeah, I think it's 110 cents."
"4713160","4715120"," No, that dollar doesn't print that dollar for me. "
"4715940","4717480"," So I'm going to take the opposite side of that trade."
"4719680","4726600"," When that option goes down to, let's say, a penny, they can then buy back that share that they"
"4726600","4727100"," sold, right?"
"4727760","4731960"," And allow it to go back up because the 10 cent trade is going to go up to that penny"
"4731960","4732420"," trade."
"4732880","4734920"," It might stay at a penny into the end of the day today. "
"4735260","4735680"," Does that make sense?"
"4736400","4738640"," So their delta neutral on that trade."
"4738880","4739320"," Does that make sense?"
"4740500","4742640"," Meanwhile, they're taking fees all along the way."
"4744580","4746600"," I'm not explaining this well. "
"4746820","4749240"," I have to think about how to explain this simply for you."
"4752500","4753280"," It seems awesome."
"4753860","4754320"," Hey, thanks, Stephen. "
"4759460","4762720"," I figured that we would rally hard to get those spy puts worth us."
"4763460","4767000"," No, I didn't think we would, I didn't think we would, the spy puts are worth us."
"4767140","4769520"," The majority of the spy puts at this point are worth us. "
"4771220","4772520"," The, hold on a second, let me look."
"4774970","4776090"," Give me one second."
"4776630","4777710"," You know, I will look. "
"4786350","4792910"," Yeah, so Max Payne for today is, you want to guess what Max Payne is for all the calls and"
"4792910","4795390"," all the, all the puts that are in the market."
"4795630","4797130"," Does anybody know what Max Payne for today is?"
"4797870","4798590"," It's a 385."
"4800070","4806250"," So I mean, the most number of contracts for today to be worthless would be for us to trade to"
"4806250","4808110"," 385 for today. "
"4809550","4812190"," I wear at 395 right now."
"4813290","4817210"," So where, where, where, where do the dealers want us to be today?"
"4818110","4820550"," They want to, they want us to be at 385."
"4822370","4826030"," And so let's say everyone buys calls today, right?"
"4827630","4833410"," Let's say, let's say some guy has some Yoshi Sean from Japan comes into the market. "
"4833590","4839240"," That's what he used to do is step into the market."
"4840200","4842860"," So do, so what do we see at the end of the day today?"
"4842860","4845420"," More than likely we'll trade down into 385."
"4846920","4847920"," I'm not, not always. "
"4848260","4849200"," That doesn't always happen."
"4850500","4855120"," But 385 is where the Max Payne for all the calls and all the puts in the market are."
"4859490","4860950"," Really hard as big as puts. "
"4862330","4863550"," I'm missing what he has saying."
"4864970","4866270"," Trade report and dribs it."
"4866930","4869650"," The last 50% of the block at 385 was absorbed. "
"4870670","4871850"," That's next test might break through."
"4872750","4875490"," How do you determine weak buyers sellers or the stand-up indicators?"
"4878040","4884080"," So in the right-hand side of, if you watch my cursor over here, you'll see down below here."
"4885280","4890480"," These two little bubbles on the Dom are telling me we have more buyers than sellers. "
"4892380","4896020"," And on the right-hand side over here as well, I've got standing orders."
"4896360","4899620"," We have lots of standing orders like 2,000 or 10,000 standing orders."
"4903450","4906150"," So right now we have weak buyers, but the stock price is going up. "
"4906290","4907190"," So what does that tell me?"
"4907210","4909110"," It's telling me that this is a short squeeze."
"4909670","4911570"," Shorts are closing their positions at the moment."
"4912070","4915630"," So let me scroll over and show you this. "
"4915930","4917890"," So right now we're going up, right?"
"4920350","4921530"," Is this a volume?"
"4922030","4923850"," Is there a volume behind this squeeze higher?"
"4924170","4925530"," No, this is a low volume pump."
"4926930","4930050"," So if you're looking here, right, there's no volume behind this."
"4930210","4931570"," There's no huge buyers here. "
"4931830","4936830"," So this is a short that closed for profit, right?"
"4937710","4938870"," And we're now trading higher."
"4939950","4945490"," And they're looking for another position to take us lower again, right?"
"4946670","4949130"," So this doesn't always happen 100% of the time."
"4949850","4958410"," But unless buyers were to step in here at any point, I'm looking for sellers to step right back in"
"4958410","4960950"," here at this VWAP and sell this down. "
"4961250","4964110"," And this might actually be the big trade for going down."
"4964250","4968110"," So we're going to take a look at this and I'm going to see if it rejects here and possibly"
"4968110","4971130"," take a put as we come into the VWAP here."
"4973650","4977810"," Now down here, let's say we're on a, let's bring this to a five-minute bar. "
"4980830","4986070"," So let's look at a five-minute volume, right?"
"4986230","4987310"," You want to see my cursor down here."
"4988070","4989410"," And look up here where my cursor is."
"4989510","4990510"," You'll see up here this volume. "
"4991410","4995610"," And I'm looking for, I got 600,000 buyers here, 540,000 buyers here."
"4995610","4997130"," That's not showing me anything."
"4997910","5000450"," 15-minute bar, looking right here. "
"5000750","5002210"," Two million buyers, that's weak."
"5002810","5004390"," I want to see like five million buyers."
"5004830","5006650"," I want to see 15 million buyers. "
"5007290","5008570"," I want to see like a hammer candle here."
"5008870","5008930"," Boom."
"5009830","5011250"," I know where we're going up. "
"5011390","5013830"," Now we might go up here, but that's what I want to see."
"5014050","5015650"," I want to see convictions."
"5016470","5018090"," So if I take 10 trades, right?"
"5018950","5021130"," Let's say I want to take 10 trades. "
"5021730","5023130"," Let's say I want to trade for 10 years."
"5023770","5026930"," And of those 10 trades, how many of those have to be a sure thing?"
"5027430","5031970"," And how many of those have to pay more than 20, 30 percent, right?"
"5032110","5037070"," We need to get at least like three or four, two, three, 100 percent, 200 percent, 300 percent,"
"5037090","5038570"," bangers to make money."
"5040150","5044030"," So if I have a list of qualifications for me to buy a debt, what am I looking for?"
"5044230","5048530"," I'm looking for some conviction, which I'm not seeing any here, right?"
"5048710","5051090"," And the 15-minute I'm not seeing, the five-minute I'm not seeing it. "
"5052810","5053290"," Right?"
"5054290","5058250"," I'm looking over on my book map over here, right?"
"5058690","5061530"," And I'm looking on the right-hand side over here."
"5062770","5065430"," And there's buyers, but it's not many buyers."
"5065950","5067690"," It's not like there's a standing order. "
"5068170","5069110"," Hey, take my money."
"5069530","5070250"," We're going up."
"5071150","5072910"," So can I trade this and make money?"
"5073610","5074570"," Can I trade this?"
"5075450","5078130"," Is the price of that op that call option going to go up?"
"5079670","5083110"," Um, like, can I take this trade right here for five minutes?"
"5083330","5083510"," Sure. "
"5084410","5086350"," I do like a two-minute or five-minute trade."
"5088310","5089930"," Uh, let me switch this over."
"5092950","5094910"," So could I have taken this trade right here?"
"5095190","5095270"," Sure. "
"5096310","5099150"," Is it worth the risk for me to take that trade right there?"
"5099330","5099470"," No."
"5100550","5104030"," If I wanted to pick up a bull's bull's trade here, where do I want to pick it up?"
"5104570","5105070"," Above VWAP."
"5105530","5106750"," This is where VWAP is. "
"5106750","5109610"," I'd rather take the trade here, right?"
"5109790","5111730"," I don't want to take this trade here as a bull."
"5112470","5114010"," This is a bear trade."
"5114450","5119750"," This is where, because we're below VWAP, bears are looking to sell this over. "
"5120610","5123770"," This is actually the meatiest part of that trade."
"5124170","5129290"," So, uh, just like this, remember we posted on Twitter, I said they're going to sell the open and"
"5129290","5130010"," they did, right?"
"5130710","5132170"," Said to you on Twitter, they're going to sell this open."
"5132310","5132830"," That was a trade. "
"5133610","5135970"," And the bears want this second trade right here."
"5136750","5140530"," So they are looking to roll this market over right here."
"5141290","5142570"," So this is on the bears to do. "
"5143870","5145790"," So no, I wouldn't take this trade as a bull."
"5146230","5147670"," I would take it above VWAP."
"5148210","5150510"," And how do you take the trade as a bull and VWAP?"
"5150970","5153250"," You're looking for something one, two, three, and then move up higher. "
"5155410","5156830"," But not this trade down here."
"5158050","5158370"," Too risky."
"5159170","5161670"," Too risky for a fast reversal straight down. "
"5163690","5164690"," Not enough volume behind the trade."
"5167170","5168910"," How do you term wheat fire as a service?"
"5169450","5170410"," Hey, Michael King."
"5170530","5170790"," How are you?"
"5174450","5175810"," Does it grind a really IPO?"
"5176830","5178010"," Is it serious, Cody?"
"5179190","5180050"," Three to five puts. "
"5180590","5184730"," Those days, like every live with the rotation out of oil?"
"5185070","5186050"," Yeah, you know, that's not a thing."
"5186290","5189410"," Oil is, um, excel, excel is doing really well."
"5189910","5190650"," Oil, not so much. "
"5192510","5193770"," Not, not so much on oil."
"5194550","5196830"," Probably the most I learned for trading stream in less than one hour."
"5197330","5198330"," I'll see you again more often. "
"5198410","5198670"," Hell yeah."
"5199030","5199990"," Three to five, three to five."
"5200270","5203190"," What are your thoughts on spy explorations five days a week?"
"5203490","5204750"," Will that fuck up the status quo?"
"5204970","5206590"," How are we trading more multiply, et cetera?"
"5207350","5213090"," Yesterday, day before yesterday, there was a gamma, not a gamma flip but a gamma. "
"5213830","5219070"," Gamma was like reset across all option contracts heading into mid-December."
"5220650","5222650"," Implied move is like 380 to 400."
"5225410","5227210"," More bears for the end of the year, maybe not today. "
"5227490","5228890"," Yeah, Thomas, I agree with that."
"5229010","5229690"," They want to fuck more bears."
"5230490","5231490"," Anything got to fuck bears. "
"5231850","5232210"," 100%."
"5232670","5234390"," Tesla Max Payne today is one and a five."
"5234810","5237770"," Can you move the window of the camera so we can see the heroin, heroin direction?"
"5238110","5238170"," Yes. "
"5239210","5240870"," I will, I will move that right now."
"5240910","5242170"," Let's switch back over to book back."
"5244250","5246350"," And you guys see that, you guys see that red?"
"5246850","5247690"," Why you guys to see that?"
"5248030","5249130"," We'll move my camera over here. "
"5249970","5250790"," It's like my camera is missing."
"5250790","5253850"," Listen, my camera is missing here."
"5254970","5262310"," It looks like my camera is fucked up. "
"5267100","5267540"," Well, here."
"5271340","5273260"," Let me just turn my camera off on that one."
"5274260","5278660"," So, I want you to see this, see what cursor is right here?"
"5279960","5282100"," These are buyers stepping in above here. "
"5282360","5283920"," See my cursor over here on the right-hand side?"
"5284120","5286000"," This red bar that just showed up."
"5287640","5289120"," This is positive for bulls."
"5291500","5293320"," And I want you to see that, okay?"
"5293620","5296200"," So the bulls are now sitting on top of broken through. "
"5296960","5302600"," I want to start seeing some nice big fat green, green balls here for a trade higher."
"5303800","5304900"," So what are we looking for?"
"5307340","5308180"," Just right here."
"5308340","5310260"," We're looking for this VWAP line right here. "
"5311000","5315040"," I want to see this boom boom and then I move higher right here."
"5318040","5320940"," Let's see if the bulls can hold on or if the bears are going to step in."
"5322120","5323880"," And try to reverse this right now. "
"5326600","5328340"," Let me switch back over here to the book map."
"5330100","5331520"," Can you guys see me on the camera?"
"5332040","5333120"," My camera is off, I think."
"5334800","5335400"," Let's see. "
"5339600","5340320"," That's kind of weird."
"5341200","5349270"," I don't know why my camera is turned off here."
"5349610","5349770"," Hold on. "
"5355680","5356900"," Yeah, my camera turned off."
"5356980","5357420"," I don't know why."
"5358800","5359440"," Hold on there. "
"5362580","5363880"," I'm going to find out why my camera turned off."
"5365520","5370240"," Let me move over the movie over here so you guys can see that."
"5379050","5380130"," Maybe that helps you guys. "
"5380430","5381810"," Let me see that helps better over there."
"5395240","5395980"," And I'm back on here."
"5398600","5399520"," And my camera turned off. "
"5399640","5399980"," I don't know why."
"5401400","5402520"," That's what you guys are talking about."
"5402800","5403900"," Was up over 400%. "
"5404900","5405560"," No shit."
"5405920","5406640"," GRND, huh?"
"5406940","5407700"," I'm going to look it up right now."
"5409100","5410540"," Hey, oh, see if you fuck with me. "
"5415750","5418010"," Fuck with Jesus fucking Christ."

"5424370","5426530"," That thing was up at $14."
"5427350","5431450"," Went to $71.51. Holy fuck, Cody."
"5439500","5439940"," 248%. "
"5456220","5457320"," Hang tight for just a second."
"5457360","5457740"," I'm still here."
"5471330","5473210"," Cody, I thought you were fucking around, bro. "
"5473390","5473930"," I had no idea."
"5473930","5475970"," I just can't believe I didn't look for grinder."
"5476150","5477590"," I'm on the news all morning. "
"5477590","5478730"," I'm working on getting the screen up."
"5479190","5480550"," I had no idea, bro."
"5485500","5488960"," What if I protect the futures trade with a trailing stop on the way up in your example?"
"5491000","5492200"," Joshua, rephrased that question. "
"5492320","5493260"," I must have missed part of it."
"5495560","5499840"," If you want me to talk about how to protect the trade in futures, I can, like a long trade"
"5499840","5501460"," in futures, how to protect it."
"5503260","5504640"," Is my camera overheating?"
"5505320","5506300"," Is that what's happening?"
"5507300","5508400"," I'll put a fan on it. "
"5508900","5511980"," I get the heat in the, the heat in this room right now is like fucking 900 degrees."
"5516110","5516670"," One second."
"5520380","5521140"," Is there a high temp?"
"5521460","5523020"," Well, I've got, let me hold on a second. "
"5523120","5524260"," I'm going to turn the heat down."
"5528140","5530360"," I, uh, heat's off."
"5530840","5531860"," The head and eye is a long story. "
"5534800","5535840"," Okay, there's a high temp."
"5536260","5538500"," I have a VIX target of 22.86 today."
"5539360","5540400"," Good morning, R.S. How are you?"
"5543220","5544700"," You had no idea, Cody. "
"5548880","5549960"," Game here is coming in hot."
"5550200","5550640"," Oh, fuck."
"5551600","5553100"," Drinder very thin volume, of course. "
"5554220","5555360"," How you guys are killing me?"
"5557460","5562300"," That's, um, that's on apple, misfit, amazon, and you're, you're in."
"5562680","5562980"," Yep."
"5563240","5566200"," So sand's asking about apple, what Microsoft Amazon to your end?"
"5567960","5569960"," Yeah, I didn't, I didn't, oh, I know what grinder is. "
"5570080","5571020"," I didn't know that grinder."
"5572940","5581270"," I didn't know that grinder was, uh, launching today."
"5582250","5583370"," I have to be careful with my words. "
"5584290","5587310"," I'm not, uh, I like gay people."
"5587490","5592170"," So I've got no problems with gay people, but I don't want, you know, be a dick or anything."
"5595540","5599120"," Uh, we really surprised, I didn't know a guy. "
"5599640","5600620"," Nice to see back houses."
"5600900","5601520"," The house is gone."
"5601780","5602400"," Yeah, house is gone. "
"5602400","5609400"," This is, um, yeah, it's, uh, so the grinder tick, um, I'm on it right now."
"5609560","5610860"," Actually there's a pump coming in right now."
"5612300","5614320"," Uh, there's the dry, this is grinder. "
"5614900","5616420"," This is the one minute charter grinder."
"5617220","5619640"," Looks like they're gonna buy and close these, try to close these gaps."
"5619860","5620820"," You want to go long on grinder. "
"5622440","5627440"," Uh, you're gonna be looking for, uh, you're gonna be looking for, right?"
"5627560","5628980"," You guys want to know where to be looking for sellers?"
"5629520","5630300"," I'll show you right now."
"5631060","5631860"," One right there."
"5633600","5636060"," And, uh, you guys want to know where the sellers are?"
"5636200","5636560"," I'll show you. "
"5639560","5640200"," Right there."
"5643850","5644930"," You guys want to trade grinder?"
"5645070","5645850"," You guys want to do pump and dumps?"
"5646910","5648010"," I'm gonna get in trouble for this."
"5649270","5652710"," Uh, where else are we gonna come down below here as well?"
"5663220","5664760"," Should be, should be, should be. "
"5671000","5672680"," Shouldn't be telling you guys that I do this stuff."
"5672840","5673180"," It's terrible."
"5674720","5677440"," Uh, so what's going on with grinder here?"
"5679620","5681660"," Uh, they're definitely trading VWAP. "
"5681820","5686800"," This usually on something like this, you might see this work two or three times."
"5687520","5692360"," So be aware of that if you're gonna buy the grinder, trade grinder right at this moment."
"5692940","5694240"," Personally, I'd like to buy it right here. "
"5694960","5698440"," For my cursor is, uh, 33, 64, 28, 93."
"5699160","5700620"," You could probably, though, hold this."
"5700940","5702360"," You could buy, you could buy this right now. "
"5702880","5705200"," And it'll come back up again, even if it goes down."
"5705460","5708620"," So even if this rolls over real quick, it's probably more than likely gonna go back here."
"5709320","5713520"," Uh, but you're looking for, you're looking for something like this. "
"5715040","5715960"," Um, let's see."
"5716500","5718680"," For something to buy, something like that."
"5719780","5722300"," Then probably somewhere down in there and something like, maybe like that. "
"5723220","5724140"," Does that seem to make sense?"
"5724660","5725780"," I'm gonna roll over into the bell."
"5727000","5728040"," Now that might not work."
"5728240","5729680"," Let me, let me refresh that. "
"5731920","5734020"," Probably, I gotta think about this for me."
"5734100","5734940"," You guys put me in the spot."
"5739140","5740080"," Maybe right there. "
"5744420","5745800"," I'll put the idea down in here."
"5748800","5750100"," I don't trust this right here."
"5750960","5751480"," How about this?"
"5758480","5762980"," I might buy that right there. "
"5766260","5768720"," You ain't ever getting back up there to close that cap, I don't think."
"5769340","5779240"," I don't think you're getting that."
"5779800","5780680"," There is support here. "
"5780820","5782720"," You can see there's buyers here where the cursor is."
"5783360","5784100"," There's buyers at 39."
"5784360","5785340"," There's buyers here at 39. "
"5785640","5787760"," But they're weaker, weaker, weaker."
"5788800","5789820"," There might be a buyer right here."
"5790760","5796240"," If you want to enter this, uh, there'll be a buyer here. "
"5796940","5801980"," You might miss the trade, but, it's so fucking dangerous."
"5802180","5803520"," I can't give financial advice."
"5804260","5805140"," I could tell you something. "
"5805460","5810960"," Like I could, what I could tell you would be buy this right now and hold on."
"5812140","5813940"," But I'm not advising you to do that."
"5815320","5816940"," I could say to you, yeah, buy this. "
"5817080","5818500"," And even if a trade's down here, just hold it."
"5819020","5820740"," I'm the hope that it bounces back up."
"5820740","5826580"," But the reality is, uh, we want to buy this right here for, for one quick move of higher. "
"5828340","5829220"," But don't do that."
"5829220","5830100"," Not financial advice."
"5831600","5832920"," Not financial advice. "
"5833760","5835600"," And you can see down here, you've got firm support."
"5835780","5836540"," This is where the buyers are."
"5836900","5839300"," So, you know, who the buyers are right here. "
"5840840","5842480"," So they're going to defend this right here."
"5843440","5844600"," So hope for this."
"5845220","5845900"," Hope to buy that. "
"5850410","5851710"," Guys, shouldn't be doing it."
"5852350","5853690"," I got to delete part of the video."
"5856610","5859150"," Should we, should we tell you where to buy fucking grinder?"
"5865410","5867970"," Yeah, I can tell the Brian Watts, you know, it'd be cool. "
"5868850","5869990"," I'd like to interview him."
"5870850","5872850"," Because I would just shut the fuck up and listen to him."
"5872890","5873830"," I like listening to him. "
"5874730","5875870"," I'd love to have him on."
"5876930","5877730"," I would love to."
"5881150","5884570"," Probably something where you want to tell people it's going to happen too. "
"5885310","5886090"," And just let him talk."
"5886830","5888190"," Because the stories are in fucking real."
"5888630","5890070"," Guys got fucking crazy stories. "
"5894680","5896360"," You know, I'll try to contact him."
"5897440","5898520"," I'll write him down to."
"5899140","5903800"," We got Bonnie, old Walmart, IBM, S, A, S, M, L, and Brian Watts. "
"5908240","5909280"," I'll reach out to him."
"5910560","5911460"," I'll just have to."
"5913200","5915540"," Yeah, we're forming a base on spy, just as a heads up. "
"5916780","5919340"," And there's still trade and VWAP here on grinder."
"5920680","5922520"," Spy is forming a base here."
"5922880","5923440"," This is good to see. "
"5924100","5925340"," Uh, all this is good."
"5925780","5926480"," I like seeing this."
"5926840","5928260"," Matter of fact, this is a nice long trade. "
"5930960","5934640"," Uh, price target above 39629."
"5935840","5936480"," Right here."
"5936780","5937360"," Where my cursor is. "
"5941760","5943140"," And let's look above."
"5943780","5946440"," Oh, I'm going to give you a PT price target right here."
"5950090","5950570"," 39627. "
"5951650","5952610"," First price target."
"5953370","5955150"," Second price target is going to be above here."
"5956010","5957170"," Now we're still looking at that. "
"5957550","5959150"," One second to go back to a five day."
"5964840","5965640"," Five minute chart."
"5966000","5966600"," Yeah, somewhere in there. "
"5967660","5968780"," Somewhere right in there."
"5971780","5972840"," Three or 15 minutes."
"5974980","5976300"," I'm already kind of touching it. "
"5976380","5977860"," You can see us fucking around up here."
"5981890","5986490"," If we break above this 396 area, you will say a CS start to squeeze."
"5987050","5988290"," This is where the short is right here. "
"5989050","5991090"," So you want to see us break above this 396."
"5993870","5994850"," Let me see here."
"5996790","5998210"," I'm not going to five minute trade. "
"6006600","6008060"," Let's see, get a ghost printer up here."
"6009240","6010240"," And I'm going to print the 396."
"6010760","6011400"," Yes, we touch 396. "
"6013720","6015080"," Briefly, we touch 396."
"6025250","6025650"," 397250."
"6027110","6027550"," On ES. "
"6027550","6027770"," Yes."
"6030710","6031890"," Sellers came right back in."
"6034070","6034990"," Again, push down. "
"6035570","6037250"," If you're going to take a short, this might be it right here."
"6047820","6048580"," I'm just a second."
"6048680","6049200"," I want to watch this. "
"6084660","6086980"," That seller's been trying to hold on right here."
"6088820","6090320"," I'm going to buy some calls here."
"6098010","6098570"," Take it. "
"6099290","6100110"," Just a second here."
"6110290","6110930"," Just a second here."
"6110930","6110970"," Yeah. "
"6114000","6116820"," So the algos are on 395p."
"6117100","6117960"," They just jumped on them."
"6118080","6119400"," They jumped on 395p. "
"6119540","6122320"," It's 168,000 contracts and 98 cents."
"6123340","6124720"," I'm looking at 397Cs."
"6125580","6127020"," I want to see if this holds here. "
"6129480","6130680"," I might want to take this trade."
"6141750","6142770"," Yeah, figuring out money."
"6142910","6143630"," I like that guy too. "
"6143930","6144330"," He's cool."
"6144670","6145090"," Mike's awesome."
"6146310","6146810"," I've talked to him. "
"6146950","6148110"," I think I've talked to him."
"6149990","6151350"," And DMs before."
"6152110","6154750"," So I'll try to reach out to him as well or write him down. "
"6155750","6156430"," Mike's awesome."
"6159770","6160510"," I like him."
"6161590","6162450"," Very smart guy. "
"6163350","6168300"," Yeah, that'd be cool."
"6168480","6169680"," A book on Brian's Life Would Be Cool."
"6169960","6175020"," Even, you know, a cool part of Brian too is you could do a book with over a series of"
"6175020","6175420"," interviews. "
"6176840","6179700"," And there are companies that will write the book."
"6181660","6183780"," You know what in Vasco, I'll look for the companies that'll do it."
"6183780","6191060"," And what they'll do is they'll write like a interview Brian and then you submit it and they would"
"6191060","6196180"," type up, they're bright, a reasonable book and then you take the book back and you edit it with"
"6196180","6198720"," Brian and then you can publish it. "
"6198880","6202340"," It's fairly cheap too, believe it or not in Vasco."
"6202520","6203640"," Do you know about that stuff?"
"6204660","6207000"," About self-publishing services that help you write the book?"
"6209410","6209870"," Hey, Myers-Bowers."
"6210050","6210290"," How you doing?"
"6211350","6211870"," That's right. "
"6212470","6212850"," Coffee and Bourbon."
"6215740","6216320"," Thanks, John."
"6217100","6217700"," Appreciate it, brother. "
"6219780","6220440"," Let me see."
"6221080","6223360"," Yeah, please like and subscribe if you don't already subscribe."
"6226260","6227300"," 395c is the heater. "
"6227600","6229660"," I need to see index still buying up holders."
"6230220","6232120"," This breaks about 397 pops 39."
"6232440","6233560"," Yeah, I agree, invest on that. "
"6234400","6235660"," I want to see if it holds here."
"6235760","6236680"," I'm going to take along, I think."
"6238500","6239900"," We're pumping low floats this morning. "
"6240400","6241060"," Yes, sir."
"6242340","6243300"," Yes, we are."
"6246020","6247460"," I have to ever play futures. "
"6247720","6248180"," Yes, I do."
"6248880","6253480"," I hedged futures for trades that I hold overnight in cash."
"6254060","6256260"," I wrote that down to someone who was asking about that hedging. "
"6256900","6257620"," That's a hedging."
"6257780","6261100"," Let me explain hedging at some point today."
"6261260","6264260"," Yeah, I've used to have markets from mayhem on. "
"6264400","6265180"," I'll have to have them on again."
"6266020","6267300"," I'll build you a conference with August."
"6267300","6268940"," I'll actually have various calls or reports here. "
"6271620","6274120"," We used to have a writer in here that we probably know that."
"6274120","6275240"," Yeah, Chase Winter."
"6276300","6276840"," That's right. "
"6280950","6282290"," August set the top move."
"6284150","6284710"," That's right."
"6285030","6286150"," Bank rub and gangster squad. "
"6287670","6289050"," Subscribe for a lot of communication."
"6289450","6290650"," August set the top mode."
"6291030","6292470"," How do you feel about Maverick of Wall Street?"
"6293010","6294230"," You know, I like Maverick of Wall Street. "
"6294490","6296830"," I like his production value."
"6297570","6301850"," I was wondering if he comes from a TV background."
"6302770","6303710"," I should reach out to him too. "
"6303810","6304310"," I like him a lot."
"6305350","6306130"," I'll write his name down."
"6307490","6308450"," Maverick of Wall Street. "
"6312820","6314060"," Where's Tesla going?"
"6317920","6322400"," Yeah, so I'll find those companies that I'll send you a link to."
"6323600","6324220"," And they're dirt cheap."
"6324520","6325820"," Like, write a book. "
"6326180","6328100"," Probably cost $1,500 max."
"6329640","6333140"," And then you get the book back."
"6333900","6336760"," You edit it with Brian and then you resubmit it. "
"6338500","6343080"," And they'll fix it all for you and then you can launch it."
"6343300","6344100"," I think people would buy it."
"6344700","6346960"," Brian's got some funny fucking stories. "
"6347320","6351120"," Many of you have known Brian's live streams for years."
"6351940","6354780"," Some of the shit that guy has talked about is bonkers."
"6356280","6357240"," Straight bonkers. "
"6365320","6369440"," Yeah, I'm more in line with your thoughts, Brad, on Maverick of Wall Street."
"6369440","6376440"," But I think part of it for him is when I like about the Maverick of Wall Street is that,"
"6377780","6384980"," what I like about Maverick of Wall Street is that he's got the, I think it's more like a show,"
"6385200","6385320"," right?"
"6385980","6387960"," The style of show that he puts on."
"6389160","6393400"," So he has to take this viewpoint at all times no matter what. "
"6393640","6395280"," But I agree."
"6395500","6396940"," I can only take so many doses of it."
"6396940","6400100"," If I'm trying to like get market inside, I'm like, can't fucking watch that guy. "
"6401840","6405000"," But if you're looking for some porn, the fucking guy is amazing."
"6405760","6407200"," You want some fucking doom porn?"
"6407460","6408640"," Maverick of Wall Street is your guy."
"6409280","6413520"," And that guy produces a beautiful show day in, day out. "
"6417770","6418790"," Why not trade futures?"
"6418950","6422330"," I used to trade futures exclusively, but I used to stay up."
"6422970","6425050"," I used to have odd hours trading futures."
"6428330","6430690"," So now what I'd like to do, and this is another thing. "
"6430690","6437150"," I used to do a lot of overnight holds on cash market because I used to have paid a lot"
"6437150","6438250"," of money make doing that."
"6438330","6441390"," I would get paid like four, five, six, seven, eight hundred percent, thousand percent."
"6441850","6444350"," But that hasn't been the case recently again, because puts don't pay. "
"6444990","6448970"," Now they're not built, they're not structured to pay well holding overnight."
"6450150","6453470"," Now when we had a bull, we're in a bull, we're still in a bull market."
"6454990","6458170"," Believe it or not, I know you guys don't believe that, but we are still in a bull market. "
"6458170","6466190"," But when we were in an upward trend overall, trading cash market was very, very paid a lot of"
"6466190","6466410"," money."
"6467550","6469270"," And so hedging futures the way I go."
"6469450","6471290"," The other thing too is I don't want to stay up all night long. "
"6472530","6474950"," It's like crack, you know, I want to find hours."
"6475650","6480670"," I've actually been happier this past year because I've gotten the most sleep I've ever gotten"
"6480670","6483030"," because I tend not to hold too much."
"6483190","6486590"," This year specifically, I haven't held many positions overnight. "
"6488170","6492190"," Any of you guys have known me for a long time or not, it depends on the year."
"6492850","6495290"," So I used to, I held stocks up until 2020."
"6496590","6501850"," I used to hold position three month calls on individual tickers, all that kind of stuff. "
"6502630","6511730"," Then in 2021, I traded, I stopped trading, I limited myself like Tesla and Apple and Spy."
"6512990","6516970"," And then at the end of 2021, I've got videos of me saying sell out, get out of everything."
"6517550","6521430"," And then of course 2020, as a bull, I'm mostly day trading. "
"6523110","6525930"," Even on weekly trades, those are tough to hold."
"6526590","6528590"," You can, you can do spreads and stuff."
"6529490","6534530"," But the way this market is right now, I've had the sanest part of my life because mostly it's like"
"6535670","6538170"," I let it open up, let the market open. "
"6539310","6545350"," I let the first 15 minutes shake out and then take some directional trades and I'm done for the"
"6545350","6545490"," day."
"6545490","6547230"," I don't have to, I don't have to hold things overnight."
"6547770","6554410"," Now when I do hold things overnight, let's say I hold, it's a different Monday, let's look real"
"6554410","6554630"," quick. "
"6558940","6562280"," And actually, yeah, I'm going to tell with that right now."
"6562420","6564120"," There's reasons in why you had futures."
"6565420","6574390"," So an example would be, it's a prime example, I'm going to say a prime example right here. "
"6579530","6588490"," So, let's take a look at the 15th, it's not really the best, it's not the best."
"6588630","6589750"," The best example is right here."
"6589930","6590890"," The better example is here. "
"6591110","6593130"," So you already know that you have resistance above here."
"6594850","6596350"," You already know this channel that we're in."
"6597530","6601170"," Let's say you bought this down below here, my cursor is right. "
"6601670","6605870"," And you wanted to hold this on the hopes that you're going to smash through a squeeze."
"6607350","6609750"," Caps like, oh yeah, we're going to squeeze this up overnight."
"6611050","6612830"," Let's say I was still holding calls here. "
"6613270","6613710"," It's risky."
"6615950","6622430"," Even not knowing this, because you have this resistance as you're heading into a close, known"
"6622430","6628310"," resistance, it's nothing for futures to, it's nothing for futures to trade up here, probably did."
"6628990","6632410"," And then started to sell off into the open, right?"
"6632490","6637030"," So this is where, if I had some calls, let's say I had some zero dates or some one dates"
"6637030","6637590"," or whatever here. "
"6638930","6645010"," I would stay up that night and be looking for us to hit this resistance in the overnight."
"6645690","6649570"," Now if we hit this resistance in the overnight, I don't want to lose my fucking calls into this"
"6649570","6650050"," open, right?"
"6650690","6653570"," So I would take a short position into cash market."
"6654010","6654470"," Does that make sense?"
"6656290","6661310"," And close that short by 6 a.m. without a fucking doubt, because I don't want to buy it back"
"6661310","6662670"," up and push it back up, right?"
"6662870","6664350"," So there's like the rules that you have. "
"6664630","6671110"," So this would be a prime example of when you're coming into known resistance into when to hedge"
"6671110","6673410"," futures or when to close a position."
"6673570","6678410"," Now let's say I wasn't trading futures and there was a chance of a gap up overnight, right?"
"6678770","6680950"," I'm not a futures trader or a hedger."
"6680950","6686650"," Then I couldn't take this trade because it's too risky of it's selling in the middle of the night. "
"6687170","6692690"," Now if we were down here, let's say we're down here back over here to the left."
"6692910","6696010"," This is less risky for me, unless we really started blasting."
"6696690","6701090"," But this is a much less risky trade if you're not a futures trader. "
"6701210","6702510"," I feel like I just hit trade cash market."
"6703170","6706030"," This is a less, it's still risky, but not as risky."
"6707690","6710490"," Not as risky as you losing everything, right?"
"6710610","6712310"," Right here, your zero dates will be dead. "
"6712690","6714910"," Right here, right at the bell, you might not, maybe not."
"6715230","6716190"," It did bounce back up."
"6716590","6719090"," You might save like 20, 30%. "
"6719090","6723470"," But this is prime examples of why you hedge futures for these gaps up."
"6725650","6729930"," So yeah, if you're going to trade cash market and hold overnight, especially on short-dated"
"6729930","6732250"," options, always like that hedge."
"6732450","6733590"," Same thing with puts. "
"6733590","6738270"," If you're buying puts here, you move along the market in case we get some news, right?"
"6738390","6743410"," If we get some good news in the morning, you want to be along the market before it opens, on"
"6743410","6744490"," news events, stuff like that."
"6744730","6752090"," So that's my only take there on hedging or short-take on hedging."
"6754930","6759950"," Why don't I always trade futures because I don't want to be up all night long. "
"6760290","6761250"," That's the baseline."
"6761250","6763570"," I don't want to fucking trade futures."
"6763850","6768590"," I don't want to be up at fucking midnight getting on YouTube or one o'clock in the morning through"
"6768590","6771010"," 4 a.m. I like to sleep at night time. "
"6772050","6773670"," So no, I don't trade futures anymore."
"6773990","6776350"," Take cash market, like a nine to five job."
"6778370","6780770"," Kind of just chopping around in here, right, burning options. "
"6781950","6789970"," I wonder, I'm wondering if that date is bad on Max Payne for today and then we're going to close"
"6789970","6794330"," this out right in here or if we trail off into the closed out of 385."
"6796250","6797790"," I wonder if that's going to happen."
"6799290","6807490"," If I'm going to do like the intuition, it's that we trade down into the bell, into 385. "
"6813610","6815050"," I didn't take a trade there either."
"6815310","6816050"," I didn't take this trade."
"6816290","6817490"," So no bad trade so far today. "
"6818270","6818970"," No trades at all."
"6820610","6821310"," Not for me."
"6826070","6828630"," I'm very much, what am I supposed to do?"
"6828630","6829630"," Somebody guys are right right here. "
"6833180","6834800"," Hey, let me look at grind real quick."
"6835040","6835800"," I got halted again."
"6836100","6837800"," Jesus Christ, I did get halted again. "
"6837920","6839080"," They traded right off VWAP."
"6839860","6842040"," Okay, so let's look back at grind real quick."
"6844560","6846000"," So they traded VWAP here. "
"6847040","6848220"," I would have been a buyer down here."
"6852460","6857040"," So you see that they bought VWAP right here and you can see that they hit that first."
"6858020","6859120"," That top resistance. "
"6860240","6861940"," I came back down, halted it again."
"6863660","6866860"," I'm going to suspect that the next buy zone is going to be VWAP again."
"6867560","6871840"," On these openings, you might get one, two, maybe three trades off VWAP. "
"6872020","6874900"," So one, two, and maybe three."
"6875180","6876180"," That'd be max for today."
"6876300","6876820"," That's what I was expecting. "
"6877920","6882300"," I'm still going to say I'm going to be a buyer on down here."
"6882580","6884600"," I'm not trading this shit with you guys today."
"6887380","6888420"," Still down somewhere. "
"6888640","6889860"," This is where I know support is."
"6890540","6895060"," So we'll put this right here for the next opening."
"6895800","6897140"," You guys take a snapshot of that. "
"6899180","6900540"," Let me know buyers are here."
"6900760","6902060"," Where do we know they're trading VWAP?"
"6903260","6903820"," We'll see."
"6903940","6904600"," We'll see what happens. "
"6907140","6907640"," Hilarious."
"6908560","6912260"," That's by just throwing it back over."
"6912540","6913460"," Bears are in control. "
"6914560","6915500"," These nasty bears."
"6917120","6922380"," So if you were trading the stock market right now, if you were just out there trading, you see this"
"6922380","6924020"," VWAP here, right?"
"6927000","6929260"," And you see we traded it down, right?"
"6930140","6931380"," What does this look like?"
"6931620","6932200"," This looks like."
"6933520","6934520"," You see what that looks?"
"6934740","6935520"," That's looking like, right?"
"6935780","6937300"," That's looking like it wants to go down. "
"6937900","6938480"," You see that?"
"6939240","6939680"," Right?"
"6940200","6940460"," Rejection."
"6941100","6941520"," Rejection."
"6942500","6943660"," And it looks like it wants to go down. "
"6943660","6946840"," Now, you want to look for bear failure?"
"6947620","6952980"," It would be bear failure would be one, two, right?"
"6953600","6956240"," And then three, right?"
"6956520","6959940"," So you want to see this one, two, and three."
"6960160","6961140"," But I don't think we're getting bear failure."
"6961380","6963960"," I think we got, I think this is, I'm bearish here. "
"6968250","6969770"," I'm pretty, I'm pretty fucking bearish."
"6969870","6973410"," Unless they just do this ping-pong shit all day long as possible."
"6974890","6975750"," I'm not trading that. "
"6976970","6977570"," It's garbage."
"6978910","6979590"," Hot garbage."
"6984310","6986110"," We talked about where Tesla's going. "
"6990610","6990790"," Tesla."
"6992050","6993150"," Double bottom on Tesla."
"6993430","6993690"," I like that. "
"6993830","6994230"," I like this."
"6994670","6995390"," True bottom on Tesla."
"6996190","6996730"," Long Tesla. "
"6999300","6999660"," Definitely."
"7000460","7001760"," Definitely long Tesla here."
"7005500","7005900"," I like it. "
"7006300","7006760"," 178."
"7007300","7007480"," 85."
"7007960","7010340"," No new low on Tesla. "
"7010640","7011000"," I like it."
"7013690","7015210"," I like the bottom forming in Tesla."
"7015590","7016150"," I'm happy with this. "
"7016850","7018390"," I might not take that long until Monday."
"7018950","7021370"," I'd like to see it on Monday, not today."
"7022590","7024070"," But I like this bottom forming. "
"7024770","7025650"," I like seeing it."
"7026170","7026890"," Maybe the close."
"7028290","7033200"," Close might be nice to buy on Tesla. "
"7033460","7033860"," I like this day."
"7033940","7036800"," This day is actually, I'm bearish in the day."
"7038020","7042540"," But I'm getting more and more bullish as we look towards Monday and next week. "
"7043740","7046040"," Now with this price action across the market."
"7046580","7047600"," Let's see, look at Dixie real quick."
"7048240","7050220"," Yeah, Dixie's getting, Dixie's looking strong. "
"7051760","7052780"," Vix, not so strong."
"7054140","7055760"," HYG is telling you, we're weak."
"7058240","7059520"," HYG, it's weak, man. "
"7060320","7061260"," HYG is still weak."
"7064660","7068100"," I don't know, the Tesla's trading on its own at this point."
"7069100","7070060"," Look around here. "
"7071040","7071740"," We're going to bunch of stuff."
"7072060","7072980"," Look at NDX real quick."
"7079360","7082700"," Yeah, I like to sell off in the close and then a rip higher on Monday. "
"7083180","7084360"," Even with NDX, I like it."
"7086780","7088220"," Walmart's still fucking cranking."
"7090590","7094390"," Yeah, metal looks like it's a good long trade on Monday, believe it or not. "
"7095790","7097110"," We're going to look around here."
"7098570","7100230"," Yeah, Amazon's still sewing off."
"7105160","7106320"," TLT's still sewing off. "
"7107520","7108780"," But boy, look at TLT."
"7108960","7111660"," TLT is looking like it wants to get ripping."
"7112540","7113420"," I don't know how you could be. "
"7113740","7120960"," Some things out there right now are, if I'm looking around, now I'm looking around the market here,"
"7121140","7121560"," XLF."
"7123460","7124160"," XLV's pointing."
"7125860","7134540"," That's a, L-R-E-Y-X-L-B. "
"7136900","7138080"," So, Y's sewing off."
"7140180","7141320"," Has XLP sewn?"
"7141500","7142520"," Nope, XLP's on top."
"7142920","7143420"," That's good too. "
"7144260","7144860"," That's good to see."
"7146120","7148440"," So, U, that's mixed message."
"7164970","7166290"," Yeah, I might not take a trade today. "
"7166550","7166910"," I might be waiting."
"7166910","7174470"," I want to take a trade on the close or Monday for next week or for December 16th, possibly."
"7176290","7178470"," There's a lot of chop around the market. "
"7179290","7181350"," And there's a lot of the underlying tickers of the spy."
"7181730","7182930"," They're telling different stories."
"7185610","7188850"," And you know what, I was saying, the spy, I think there might be a tech trade. "
"7189230","7193670"," I think the strongest trade into the holidays is a QQQ's long trade."
"7194650","7195830"," Might be even stronger than the spy."
"7199350","7200670"," That might be the holiday trade. "
"7202590","7205470"," Not an individual ticker, but a QQQ's."
"7212670","7214050"," Let me know what you think in the comments."
"7217870","7218810"," Let's see what you guys are doing. "
"7228680","7230540"," Why buy their underlying when you could buy a zero-day adoption?"
"7230640","7231560"," So, I like buying their underlying."
"7236920","7237860"," Hey, Tom Pacheco."
"7240420","7241140"," Yeah, it is. "
"7241280","7242680"," That story will drive more than it's bananas."
"7243820","7246540"," I think there's no real insight for daytakers, but is there all of you?"
"7246660","7247620"," The news recap is valuable."
"7248040","7250440"," Yeah, I think his news recap is valuable for..."
"7251900","7256640"," I think my workable Wall Street news recap is definitely valuable. "
"7259140","7261200"," 3114, your wife's boyfriend's calling out."
"7263440","7264420"," It's time, Monday."
"7265700","7267180"," I'm afraid of tips right now. "
"7267300","7268260"," I still don't like Nvidia."
"7269260","7270160"," Nope, good question."
"7271080","7272220"," I was thinking about them yesterday. "
"7278160","7279320"," Yeah, I'll get some whiskey."
"7279520","7281520"," I'll take a break real quick and grab some whiskey if you guys want to have whiskey."
"7282780","7286360"," Okay, so Cody's saying I bet over the weekend Twitter starts crashing or you'll unfires more"
"7286360","7286680"," people. "
"7287120","7288200"," Tesla drops more money."
"7289120","7290540"," Seasonally, Tesla is weak."
"7291180","7294720"," Just so you all know, Tesla is seasonally weak heading into March. "
"7297120","7301840"," On a zigzag pattern looking over like a five-year period, should be very weak into March."
"7303000","7305800"," The keys are behind at some point will have a rotation from NGI."
"7306160","7306640"," Agree with that?"
"7309100","7312560"," Yeah, I like that TQQ calls for December 16th. "
"7312740","7313100"," I like it."
"7315300","7316380"," Yeah, I'll get some whiskey going."
"7319500","7321580"," I'll take a break at some point here and we'll get some whiskey going. "
"7322560","7323360"," So that's the other thing."
"7323660","7326520"," I don't know if I can trade with you guys every day the entire day."
"7328180","7328860"," So, maybe. "
"7329780","7332600"," So, you guys, we'll see how it goes."
"7333940","7336580"," Like the whole like nine to fucking four was brutal."
"7337520","7339660"," So I have a ton of stuff I want to do for you guys. "
"7340340","7341260"," Have ready for you every day."
"7349560","7353620"," Yes, you need to exit fucking Tesla heading into $200 games."
"7356080","7357740"," A call spread would be nice here in Tesla. "
"7357940","7360080"," If you're like, oh, Tesla's going to get out and get that new low."
"7360420","7362580"," It really doesn't matter if Tesla gets the new low."
"7363460","7367320"," If that's the end of the day, it goes down to 173 and 99 or something. "
"7367720","7368700"," And you're in a call spread."
"7369640","7371880"," It's still going to, it's still going to get a reaction."
"7373580","7379580"," But I think it's trade from, I think it's trade somewhere down here on this bottom somewhere down"
"7379580","7379760"," here. "
"7379920","7380840"," Nice call spread or something."
"7382360","7383040"," Would be nice."
"7387930","7389530"," Some kind of a, I don't know what to do debit. "
"7389810","7390790"," I might do a credit spread."
"7393290","7394770"," You could possibly wait until close."
"7395050","7396490"," So, you know, Tesla gets weak sometimes. "
"7396490","7399230"," Sometimes it doesn't, but it can get weak on a Friday."
"7401900","7405300"," But I do like the idea of a call spread in Tesla for like the middle of the month."
"7406080","7408080"," Middle of December, like December 16th. "
"7409200","7411060"," Maybe two, maybe you can even do the 31st."
"7411580","7415360"," So they get 200 turns to a wide call spread."
"7415640","7418940"," 170, wherever right now, 178 to 200 be nice. "
"7429390","7430510"," Yeah, I'm not going to say anything he's done."
"7430650","7431170"," I think I am too."
"7431350","7434550"," I don't like, I don't like this mess. "
"7435050","7436770"," You could trade this mess if you wanted to."
"7437630","7438610"," This back and forth."
"7443570","7445150"," Yeah, I think the subject continues as well. "
"7445330","7449360"," Maybe like three hours of morning session."
"7450940","7451720"," No worries, guys."
"7455070","7457190"," I don't leave my chair when I have a futures contract on. "
"7457350","7459110"," Yeah, you know, you knew who talks about that?"
"7459810","7469610"," You guys want to know, but like I think Brian Watts at one point talked about"
"7469610","7472250"," how he had a con, he had a shit."
"7472750","7474770"," Yeah, I think he had fully s contracts on."
"7475810","7478550"," And I don't know how much money it was, but I think it was six figures. "
"7479950","7481750"," And the market went against him."
"7483390","7485350"," And he described that."
"7485710","7486730"," He described that. "
"7486830","7489430"," I've had, so I've lost my worst trade ever."
"7489510","7492050"," I think I lost $130,000."
"7496610","7499390"," No, yeah, because I've lost, one time I lost. "
"7500170","7502250"," I lost 90,000 on listening to Bears."
"7502510","7503770"," Tell me the market was going to crash once."
"7504250","7507370"," Some puts and I fucking held him to the fucking end. "
"7507590","7508310"," It was fucking horrible."
"7509270","7518750"," And I lost $130,000 on a trade once before, something like that, but he, his experience that he"
"7518750","7523690"," related was the same experience I went through."
"7525170","7527610"," But he ended up, I think he ended up making his money back. "
"7527790","7532470"," That's the one good thing about futures is, if it comes back down or goes back up, you can get"
"7532470","7532950"," your money back."
"7533570","7534730"," Or some of your money back."
"7536510","7537750"," Options, fuck me. "
"7541570","7543630"," I don't even know if I'm talking about that stuff anymore."
"7549800","7555730"," Yeah, it's, so it's weird."
"7556130","7563230"," Where's like, so what I think was going on was, I used to trade or I, I not getting greedy,"
"7563230","7564110"," but I used to trade. "
"7566270","7572590"," I would, I think when I was placing my trades, I was placing two large of trades and I was"
"7572590","7573590"," impacting the market."
"7573990","7579270"," So if I placed like a $100,000 trade, options trade, it was making an impact."
"7580390","7582570"," And I think that they knew I was a retail trader. "
"7583130","7592110"," Like in my mind, I felt like from order flow selling to market makers, dealers, I think"
"7592110","7597430"," I feel like I was taken advantage of."
"7598330","7608030"," This day, so when I, when I build a position, now I'm not, I don't stand out as much"
"7608030","7609790"," when I'm building a position."
"7611770","7615850"," When I take large trades, especially if they're like short dated with large positions, like throw"
"7615850","7618130"," $100,000 down, it's not a lot of money. "
"7618290","7624450"," But if you throw a hundred grand down on a short term directional trade, it does make an impact."
"7624610","7627950"," People see it, they'll follow you into the trade and shit like that."
"7627950","7629210"," It's like a long conversation. "
"7629710","7636970"," So the more money, the more that I, when I'm doing large trades, the more that I enter into them"
"7636970","7638990"," slowly, I tend to be more successful."
"7639350","7640370"," I don't know what the reason is for that."
"7641050","7648590"," My best trade that ever had, I made, I posted this on Twitter once. "
"7648950","7652170"," I've deleted it since deleted it because people didn't believe me."
"7653290","7656250"," But I posted this on Twitter once."
"7656510","7665270"," I actually showed, I showed the actual like the reports from, from my broker. "
"7665930","7668710"," So I, I, my best trade ever, like one time trade."
"7672620","7674040"," Yeah, no good CI."
"7674500","7676420"," I can look at, I'll start like going to take this for you guys too right now. "
"7677800","7678620"," This is dog shit."
"7679700","7681420"," This is utter fucking dog shit."
"7688620","7690660"," This is, the market's a hot mess right now. "
"7690660","7691160"," Look at CI."
"7691580","7697440"," Look at that cranking."
"7704780","7705220"," Gorgeous. "
"7708020","7709140"," Beautiful run on CI."
"7710580","7712760"," Take the money and run CI is what I tell you."
"7713580","7715840"," If you want to know, take the money and run. "
"7726650","7728930"," This is, this reminds me of what SE used to be."
"7732780","7734080"," Best trade you ever had was what?"
"7734440","7739040"," The 30k on Tesla calls, the weekend before it went to 1200."
"7740060","7740500"," Jesus. "
"7748590","7750810"," You want to see the CI screener or hello?"
"7755210","7756450"," Buy the dip, sell the rip."
"7759250","7761890"," Absolutely beautiful, beautiful, beautiful to that."
"7767170","7769050"," Are you coming into resistance now?"
"7770090","7772410"," Should be a good, good right in here. "
"7776850","7778970"," Get trap buyers above that 331."
"7779450","7780870"," We know we've got trap buyers, weak buyers."
"7780870","7782170"," So you guys know this. "
"7784310","7787150"," This is showing weakness right."
"7787910","7789030"," So you get this drop."
"7791470","7792630"," You can see. "
"7803990","7806430"," You can see that buyers are here, right?"
"7806650","7807470"," Buyers are down below."
"7814280","7816940"," You can see that someone with money wanted to push this up."
"7817120","7818400"," They did, right?"
"7818620","7819440"," Hit established resistance. "
"7820440","7823840"," And you can see that the bulls weren't quite strong enough."
"7824100","7826300"," So this looks like the beginning of distribution to me."
"7826800","7828380"," So I think you'll see something like this. "
"7832800","7833880"," Hold on here."
"7838170","7840130"," You'll see someone wanted it up there, right?"
"7840510","7842850"," Took their money, pushed it back up."
"7843010","7844210"," They're going to take their money, right?"
"7845230","7846370"," Same thing will happen again. "
"7847070","7850390"," Push back up, push back up, and then the roll over."
"7850510","7851330"," A large timeframe."
"7855640","7856380"," That's gonna be my guess. "
"7856680","7857780"," I would take your money off here."
"7864600","7865300"," Beginnings of distribution."
"7866180","7867160"," Can you buy down here?"
"7868680","7870460"," I'd be looking for a buy down here as well. "
"7872500","7873100"," To re-enter."
"7873860","7874720"," It's a really nice trade."
"7874960","7875420"," This is nice and consistent. "
"7875840","7876720"," You can trade this for the whole year."
"7876820","7877220"," It's a good trade."
"7878700","7879060"," Beautiful. "
"7885540","7886520"," Absolutely gorgeous."
"7892580","7894620"," Huge falls, one, two."
"7898200","7899620"," If we do break here. "
"7901320","7906070"," Break there, right back down to there."
"7908990","7913670"," I'd want to see consolidation in here."
"7915930","7917430"," This is where I'd want to see some consolidation. "
"7917890","7919610"," And I would like to see some distribution down here."
"7928700","7930880"," It gets better somewhere up here."
"7933040","7954300"," Just up, push up, and somewhere in"
"7954300","7954480"," there. "
"7967480","7968580"," Let me get a second here."
"7996820","7998720"," Buyers there and buyers down here."
"8000400","8009690"," I'll tell you what, this is where let's see the starts right here. "
"8011810","8013810"," This is where the banks are in, somewhere down in here."
"8061610","8064190"," Next logical place is 350, but I don't know that you get up there."
"8065990","8069330"," If you break above that 331, you'd be long again to 350. "
"8071090","8072150"," See the natural place."
"8077290","8078050"," Somewhere like that."
"8079630","8080690"," I wouldn't be a buyer here though. "
"8081090","8081830"," It'd be a seller here."
"8083950","8084930"," I'd be a buyer down here though."
"8086550","8088770"," I'd be a buyer at 292 again. "
"8097020","8102820"," Clean this up."
"8104800","8105820"," I think type one second."
"8111360","8113540"," I'll take a break. "
"8117860","8119840"," So what I've got here for CI."
"8121580","8123320"," Do I think it gets up here to 350?"
"8123320","8124320"," Probably not."
"8126130","8128200"," I see this hammer reversal candle here. "
"8129920","8134360"," I would not expect it to be it's a weekly."
"8136080","8137140"," Something like that."
"8141190","8142070"," Somewhere in there. "
"8142370","8143030"," It has time passes."
"8144050","8145870"," I would call this yellow line."
"8147190","8150350"," I like it, but I don't see this going any higher. "
"8153870","8154950"," I wouldn't buy it."
"8158510","8163290"," If you look at that nastiness, just back and forth ping pong ping pong ping pong."
"8164430","8165250"," Just nasty. "
"8168610","8169490"," Just nasty."
"8170130","8171250"," Look at that nastiness."
"8178420","8178860"," Nasty. "
"8183240","8188380"," Yeah, actually he's been very very so was down."
"8189580","8190920"," Oh, you guys want to my best trade."
"8191020","8192320"," I forgot what we get back to best trade. "
"8192320","8193340"," So best trade ever."
"8198580","8201879"," How does envy ever come back from losing their Ethereum mining?"
"8202459","8203320"," Yeah, I don't think so."
"8203500","8204340"," I don't think so right now. "
"8205780","8208780"," I think it's our day where we read that."
"8209000","8209200"," What do you think?"
"8209320","8210260"," What aspects closes today?"
"8210620","8211639"," Where do I think XPS closes?"
"8214340","8218760"," 390 and maybe a quick quick dip down to hell."
"8219200","8221879"," Either at the bell or after at 385. "
"8224540","8226059"," That's what I think XPS closes today."
"8228920","8229580"," Yeah, I like some."
"8229740","8230620"," I used to like some condors. "
"8230680","8231820"," Like I like flies too."
"8235700","8236780"," Just good trades all day."
"8238000","8239340"," Yeah, so I'm going to start restart. "
"8239840","8241920"," I'm going to have the ability to restart to stream it again."
"8242180","8245420"," I have some stuff going on in my house, building a house."
"8246760","8249600"," Once it was made, I've said it to some zoom and runners are all risk free. "
"8250020","8250580"," Yeah, fruit that."
"8250940","8252480"," Still not good as OG Wall Street bats."
"8252860","8253080"," No doubt. "
"8253080","8258790"," Yeah, he thought he was in MES, but he was in EES."
"8258969","8259870"," So will you remember that story?"
"8263610","8264809"," Yeah, best trade ever."
"8265150","8267889"," I was asking, I think it's the best trade ever. "
"8268969","8271770"," I placed a bet for seven or 10 grand."
"8272590","8279510"," I was watching CNBC and the reporters leaked that Microsoft, I think."
"8281690","8284370"," I just happened to have Microsoft open, I think. "
"8286030","8286910"," Right on my desktop."
"8287650","8293090"," And CNBC was in the background and the reporter said, start talking about the deal between TikTok"
"8293090","8293990"," and Microsoft, I think."
"8295969","8301150"," And the host of the show said, Oh, we haven't talked about that yet. "
"8301650","8308469"," In that brief moment that three seconds, five seconds that CNBC knew that there was a deal, but the"
"8308469","8309850"," public did not know there was a deal."
"8310590","8316290"," So I quickly opened up zero dates on Microsoft through down, I don't know, I maybe started to like"
"8316290","8317430"," seven grand or 10 grand."
"8318290","8322250"," And I think I made $150,000 in about 15 minutes. "
"8324110","8325030"," Something like that."
"8326110","8331969"," Matter of fact, I made so much fucking money so fast that when I tried to close the position, they"
"8331969","8332889"," wouldn't accept it."
"8334129","8335629"," They wouldn't close it for me. "
"8336230","8341690"," So I had to lower people low the ask, it sucked."
"8341690","8345670"," So I think it ended up getting out of the trade for like 130 or 120 or something."
"8347590","8350889"," And I made, I made six figures in minutes. "
"8352129","8352830"," That's trade ever."
"8359070","8359930"," I don't do that anymore."
"8360250","8363190"," So Don Mafia is saying me here, looking at my 5k port. "
"8363770","8364709"," I don't do that anymore."
"8365070","8365889"," I don't trade like that anymore."
"8366770","8368290"," Those fucking days are over for me. "
"8369129","8370510"," I don't do that shit anymore."
"8370990","8371610"," You guys can."
"8371969","8372770"," I don't do that shit anymore. "
"8373110","8375809"," If you get back into a bull market, I'll do that shit with you guys."
"8375809","8377530"," But we're not in a bull market right now."
"8378110","8380430"," You have to be in like, well, we're in a bull market. "
"8381969","8383490"," We're on a longer time frame."
"8383490","8384330"," We're still in a bull market."
"8384850","8388410"," But when the trend starts going up again, we'll place it. "
"8388510","8389010"," We'll make that money."
"8396220","8397520"," I'm Seabree Ethan."
"8398080","8399060"," It'll keep running CI. "
"8400020","8402700"," Yeah, I'm not against CI continuing to go up."
"8403460","8407480"," I think that you have to be disciplined trading CI, right?"
"8407680","8408980"," You know where to buy the dips on CI."
"8409280","8410060"," You know where to sell the reps. "
"8411840","8416510"," Uh, Tesla's gonna go lower."
"8418470","8421710"," So my overall price target, Ryan, is like 90 bucks on Tesla."
"8422210","8423550"," But I don't think that's today. "
"8425950","8428690"," I was down 35k and he had some multiple contracts a couple of years ago."
"8428830","8431630"," I was a son of a bitch to be around for two days, but it turned around and I ended"
"8431630","8432330"," up fixing in the green."
"8432530","8436890"," Yeah, that's one of the good things about owning contracts is, if you can hold them long enough,"
"8438370","8440190"," hopefully you can pray and get your money back. "
"8441890","8443230"," I'm gonna put fluid excelli."
"8443350","8445650"," So excelli, um, is a good thing."
"8445930","8447570"," I'm grateful that Adam brought excelli up. "
"8448710","8450250"," Oh, let's take a look at excelli."
"8453970","8455610"," Where is it on my list in here?"
"8455770","8461210"," Because excelli has remained strong while, uh, oil has not."
"8462330","8472760"," And I am bearish on oil and"
"8472760","8476040"," excelli is starting to roll over now and show some distribution. "
"8476040","8479540"," Uh, you really need tech to pick this up though, don't you?"
"8479780","8483960"," But, you know, let's talk about excelli because that's talking about the holiday rally."
"8484360","8485860"," So what do we need?"
"8486160","8487460"," Let's look at, uh, let me clear this up."
"8494580","8496220"," Let's make clear this and bring this up for you. "
"8499190","8500250"," So let's look at excelli."
"8500910","8502390"," It's a four hour time frame."
"8502550","8502990"," We could do an hour. "
"8503810","8505770"," No, it's probably easier to look on."
"8506810","8507270"," That's good."
"8507390","8508170"," This is a good way to look at it. "
"8509650","8512450"," Let's just look at mid term for like December."
"8514970","8527580"," Um, so how do we have the the bull view point for December?"
"8527920","8528660"," And it's right there, right?"
"8529300","8530380"," We know we have demand."
"8530860","8531400"," This is bullish. "
"8531920","8533060"," I mean, this is still bullish."
"8533280","8534520"," They bought this bottom this morning."
"8535640","8537780"," So excelli is still fucking bullish. "
"8538560","8540840"," And until you have a break of this trend line, it remains bullish."
"8542160","8544100"," Instead, it stays under that trend line."
"8544700","8545440"," It remains bullish. "
"8546300","8552160"," So yeah, I think that this look to me, do you think, do I think this is topping?"
"8552540","8553840"," No, not right."
"8553980","8554220"," Not yet."
"8555300","8558240"," I think this could run for, you know, the rest of the month. "
"8558600","8563220"," I think easily could run for the rest of the month with the consecutive lower highs."
"8563380","8565080"," I think you see something like all you need is this."
"8565780","8568940"," And then this is December 31st right here, right?"
"8569400","8570740"," All you need is this to happen. "
"8571900","8574180"," And you get your holiday rally."
"8575880","8577320"," So I think it eventually rolls over."
"8577460","8578000"," Yes, I do. "
"8579360","8580720"," You can see that here, right?"
"8580880","8581920"," This lower high right here."
"8582900","8585780"," This lower high is inferring that it's going to roll over at some point."
"8586460","8587860"," But does it happen today?"
"8588100","8588660"," Probably not. "
"8589360","8590580"," Could you just take some put spreads here?"
"8590720","8592360"," Yeah, I would take some put spreads for March here."
"8593620","8594460"," Price started down below."
"8596320","8596980"," Definitely 87. "
"8598900","8600180"," I'd really like to see it though."
"8600320","8601040"," Commender right here."
"8603520","8606960"," Some of y'all probably want to see it down here, but more than likely. "
"8611720","8612440"," March 78."
"8614520","8616260"," Somewhere in here, this would be my price target for March."
"8621110","8622150"," Somewhere right in there. "
"8622310","8623710"," But I don't see that coming until March."
"8625170","8626690"," Would I like to see it down to 72?"
"8627190","8627650"," Yeah, it's possible."
"8628310","8629510"," This is possible down here. "
"8630250","8630510"," Brief moment."
"8630950","8632270"," So I'd like some put spreads for XLE."
"8633090","8633690"," Head into March. "
"8634270","8634630"," I like that."
"8634910","8636970"," I like a trade out of 78 or 72."
"8638090","8638810"," Even do a wide spread. "
"8639770","8641150"," At least you wanted to capture it all."
"8641570","8643230"," My dog is trying to get into the office."
"8647410","8649090"," I'll probably have to take a break here for a minute. "
"8650830","8652230"," Yeah, you can see it back in here."
"8653210","8655650"," I haven't looked at the seasonality of XLE yet either."
"8656030","8657870"," I would want to see that seasonality of XLE. "
"8661250","8662650"," So yeah, we have just boom."
"8662890","8664610"," So we have to rip it right there."
"8668000","8668800"," Take a look here. "
"8682710","8684390"," Yeah, I mean, you can see it right here, right?"
"8685190","8687970"," It's explosive moves up."
"8691530","8693290"," Going back all the way to 2017."
"8694770","8696050"," Five day, one year. "
"8698110","8699870"," Yeah, I wouldn't be shorting it here."
"8700830","8701890"," I wouldn't be shorting XLE."
"8703590","8705930"," I think it comes down to March for the rest of the market. "
"8705930","8708650"," So I'd be looking for like March sometime."
"8710530","8712070"," I don't know if I'd let's just do this right."
"8716790","8719750"," A lot of guys on Twitter like to see me do these. "
"8720110","8729270"," So let's do March 30, 28th"
"8729270","8733560"," right there."
"8736160","8737380"," Let's see if we can tag this."
"8740480","8741580"," That's where I think we're going. "
"8741820","8742240"," How about that?"
"8742700","8745100"," I think we go down here into March."
"8747300","8750040"," I think we'll come back and check on this."
"8752860","8753540"," Price target. "
"8756780","8757580"," Right there."
"8759440","8760500"," Pretty far away, right?"
"8765720","8766680"," Let's spread right there."
"8768220","8769160"," That's my price target. "
"8777350","8780190"," So you got my call for the day that we're going to head down to 390."
"8782770","8787570"," And 385 possibly into the bell wave lower, but we're heading that way, right?"
"8788830","8791830"," That's free free alpha for the day."
"8792330","8793570"," You got free alpha from me. "
"8796290","8797210"," Count those waves."
"8800830","8803690"," I'm not I'm not scared of you guys are okay."
"8803910","8804630"," We'll come back up. "
"8807050","8809030"," I'm grabbing a drink who's I'm going to grab a drink too."
"8809030","8810390"," We'll take a quick break here in a minute."
"8810570","8811650"," Let me go real quick. "
"8817500","8817840"," Thanks."
"8818040","8819520"," Yeah, thanks on the CI trade."
"8820240","8823100"," Test will totally just flush well 10% selling next four hours. "
"8823100","8823620"," I agree with that."
"8825160","8830020"," Well, yeah, how was I taught how to be a trader?"
"8830400","8830980"," I can talk about that."
"8831560","8832200"," Was that some of that?"
"8840300","8842560"," I can't hear nothing, Brad, good to see you, Brad. "
"8845750","8847470"," Someone has more highest target trading."
"8848010","8851830"," So I let me think back to when I first started."
"8852070","8859510"," I was an original how I got started trading was the great financial crisis. "
"8861050","8869150"," Just just read around that time when Bitcoin first was invented and I was an early Bitcoin adopter."
"8869810","8872310"," I was a burner for Burning Man and all that kind of stuff."
"8877930","8883910"," And I went to a Burning Man event when they were doing the Occupy Wall Street stuff, Burning Wall"
"8883910","8884590"," Street, all that kind of stuff. "
"8885290","8892990"," And I was already a Bitcoin early adopter because of course I like mushrooms and ecstasy and stuff"
"8892990","8893370"," like that."
"8893370","8897090"," That wasn't a huge user, but the whole tech scene at that time was like that."
"8898010","8899790"," I think you guys don't believe that, but it was. "
"8900410","8904870"," It was like all the tech pros were note, they weren't rich then and they used to hang out of"
"8904870","8905190"," Burning Man."
"8905910","8906770"," And so we'd go there."
"8906990","8915150"," I used to live in the West and so got was early adopter that and started trade just stocks and"
"8915150","8919310"," then they started trade options years past. "
"8919510","8924790"," They started to have professional and old market makers that are my mentors and eventually went on"
"8924790","8927110"," the tutelage of some of a market maker."
"8928170","8931330"," And he taught me how to trade Wall Street Bats."
"8931510","8941110"," I was a member there for that was part of the end of the Yahoo days before the"
"8941110","8942050"," bots took over. "
"8943210","8946550"," And the old timers pick up burned out of the great finance crisis."
"8946550","8949150"," And then of course Wall Street Bats is where I really made my bones."
"8949150","8955770"," Wall Street Bats is where the OG Wall Street Bats is where I learned how to trade when it was"
"8955770","8956350"," very small. "
"8956510","8959890"," You're talking like 5,000 people were in that sub."
"8960210","8964130"," And so there were some very smart professional people that taught me how to trade."
"8964490","8967570"," Ended up joining a private sub there called Vegas Bats. "
"8967990","8970130"," And as a matter of fact, the guy named Sator that's on Twitter."
"8970850","8976950"," He took me and a few other people under his wing and he's a professional as well."
"8977570","8982550"," And he taught us how to trade the market for money to make to not work anymore. "
"8983130","8984350"," And that's the short story."
"8984470","8985170"," I've got a longer story."
"8985630","8988430"," But you'll see me talk to Sator on Twitter. "
"8989750","8995030"," He was an OG Wall Street better than one of the actual OGs."
"8996270","8999810"," And so they taught me how to trade basically."
"9000750","9003210"," And then this was before Wall Street Bats blew up and went crazy. "
"9003910","9007630"," I was then I became of course part of the GME."
"9007750","9012710"," I was in GME before it was anything new about GME before it was on Twitter talking about it."
"9013090","9019010"," Ended up getting a permanent band IP band from Reddit. "
"9019970","9032110"," Got IP band from Reddit by at that time it was the sub-Reddit for Nicola."
"9033170","9039230"," Whoever the mod was got the Reddit site admins to come in."
"9039550","9042550"," And they were harassing those people. "
"9043090","9044230"," And they IP banned me."
"9044370","9047730"," They IP banned me from a Reddit account."
"9047910","9050250"," They had like 2006 I think maybe earlier. "
"9050670","9051170"," I think it was around there."
"9051470","9053310"," It says something like that."
"9053570","9056370"," So they fucked me ended my social media presence. "
"9058170","9061250"," And then I switched over to Twitter finally."
"9061750","9066710"," And there's a bunch of refugees that went to Twitter from the original Wall Street Bats."
"9069470","9071970"," And so that I made a place in the Twitterverse. "
"9072670","9082470"," And then of course as the guru-guru class of people grew on social media, I became very frustrated"
"9082470","9084770"," with watching how many people were losing money."
"9086610","9090490"," And this was the past five years or so."
"9092350","9093430"," Consistently losing money. "
"9093610","9095090"," And then the bullshit that was sold to people."
"9096050","9100270"," So I was like, no, I'm going to fucking do this myself for free."
"9100490","9101490"," And so that's what I did. "
"9103110","9110210"," And I think at that time, I think at that time, I was still listening to Brian Watson."
"9110530","9111490"," He was like slowing down."
"9111630","9112890"," He wasn't on as much anymore. "
"9113230","9116410"," And I was like, I always liked how he did that for people, for like regular people, regular"
"9116410","9117910"," traders, new traders specifically."
"9118630","9122370"," How to lose your money, how to make money, how to make this a career, how to not tap to"
"9122370","9130270"," have a job, how to pay your bills off, how to make it a full-time job, how to change"
"9130270","9130690"," your life."
"9130850","9137130"," If you want to keep your job too and just be able to not do the grind, this is a"
"9137130","9137610"," longer story. "
"9137790","9138610"," I don't want to talk about it right now."
"9139090","9144030"," Not think about it, but just have a concise thought process on it."
"9144130","9152610"," Because I remember there was a time when where I was in my life, I had owned restaurants,"
"9153250","9156410"," restaurants, food trucks, catering businesses, stuff like that. "
"9157190","9158910"," And my wife was a professional."
"9159350","9162650"," And we lived in a nice house that we lived out west of nice places."
"9163550","9164150"," It was always a grind. "
"9164430","9168870"," Everything was a grind, mortgages, car payments, insurance, taxes, kids, all this stuff."
"9169090","9170630"," And it was never, ever getting ahead."
"9171150","9172890"," Even when you get ahead, you don't really get ahead. "
"9174450","9175950"," You're just a part of that machine."
"9176410","9177410"," You just expect it to work."
"9177570","9179070"," Anything bad happens, you're totally fucked. "
"9179850","9181970"," And so for me, I was like, I don't want to be that guy."
"9182230","9187690"," And I don't want to wake up in 20, 30 years and have a medical bill."
"9188190","9191410"," And it's going to take me out of having to sell my stuff for my kids' leave. "
"9191710","9195110"," And I can't keep or it's not rational to keep my home."
"9195110","9196590"," All this stuff, right?"
"9197810","9198550"," All these pitfalls."
"9199690","9200990"," And then I wanted to create wealth. "
"9201310","9202270"," And I'm not going to create wealth."
"9203310","9205370"," Wasn't going to create wealth with the businesses that I had."
"9205490","9207150"," Wasn't going to create wealth real well. "
"9208530","9209310"," Any other way."
"9209510","9215510"," And so all this experience I had, trading over the years took me the decade, you know, five to 10"
"9215510","9217150"," years to get real good."
"9217350","9224930"," And then of course, seeking out people, seeking out like a mentor is a huge part. "
"9224930","9229210"," You want to like become friends with someone that's making consistent money or someone that's been"
"9229210","9230310"," in the market for a long time."
"9230450","9233410"," So you can at least feel free to be like, is this the right trade?"
"9233590","9234310"," Is this the wrong trade?"
"9234410","9234790"," We're doing this right?"
"9234930","9235210"," We're doing this wrong."
"9235530","9236710"," And people have different trading styles. "
"9236930","9238310"," There are people that just trade butterflies."
"9239010","9239550"," I've done that."
"9239870","9245510"," I've switched between trading styles over the years to pay what makes you feel good or what I'm"
"9245510","9245770"," doing. "
"9247850","9253730"," So you want to like, if you're like, if you know a guy that's trading butterflies, spreads all the"
"9253730","9255830"," time and you want to learn how to trade the wheel."
"9256010","9257530"," You want to learn how to trade debit call spreads."
"9257850","9260930"," Some guys, all the thought he does, debit put spreads, debit call spreads. "
"9262430","9267110"," We go spend six months or you're hanging out with that guy, that woman or whatever and figure out"
"9267110","9274130"," how they do it, why they do it, why they're making entries at the open or at the close, why"
"9274130","9279530"," they're not just going in the middle of the day, what they're looking for in the greeks to be a"
"9279530","9280770"," prime time to buy those spreads."
"9281790","9284770"," The inside and outside mechanics spend a year to trade that stuff."
"9284970","9289710"," And the next person is going to teach what you need to know and find the style of trading that"
"9289710","9295990"," makes you consistent profit so that you can have that same thing, right?"
"9296190","9296910"," So if you're like, yeah, I'm a doctor. "
"9297250","9298430"," I don't want to I want to keep being a doctor."
"9299290","9303670"," But I know that I'll never, you know, get to this point where I have financial freedom and stuff"
"9303670","9304090"," like that."
"9304610","9308050"," And, you know, I think that's what I think that's what everybody trades for. "
"9308050","9313130"," I think that's why everybody invests for is that they want to have a nice, not an Easter egg, but"
"9313130","9318990"," a nest egg that will create wealth for them."
"9319190","9323450"," Now me personally, whenever I've made large sums of money, I take it out of the market."
"9323990","9325510"," I invest mine into real estate. "
"9326090","9326830"," That's what I do."
"9327850","9329590"," And I buy everything with cash now."
"9329730","9334830"," I don't, I've done loans in the past, I've had mortgages in the past. "
"9335210","9339850"," Every, it's when you don't have to do that stuff anymore, it makes life so much simpler."
"9341950","9345230"," And then putting your money to work, of course, for you."
"9345590","9347990"," I do mine through real estate, but you can do yours through anything. "
"9348250","9350170"," There's a safe investments that you can make."
"9351190","9357150"," But the general goal is that you have this perpetual wealth that you'll never have to give up,"
"9357450","9359030"," makes you money, works for you, makes you money."
"9360310","9364370"," And you can pass it along to your wife or kids or burn it all in cocaine, whatever you want"
"9364370","9367910"," to do without being a total fucking scumbag. "
"9368450","9371250"," Some of you probably want to become scumbags, I don't."
"9372150","9376410"," Just mine, who I am as a person, I've got a wife, I've got kids who live a good life,"
"9377590","9378370"," don't do drugs anymore."
"9378690","9384350"," Not because it's just an older, you know, it was like a tech hippie or something, I don't know if"
"9384350","9385130"," you guess who you call it that. "
"9386330","9388830"," But you guys are all, you guys are all yourselves."
"9391110","9392290"," You guys have all your own wants."
"9392290","9394150"," Like for me personally, I want to sell the world. "
"9394450","9395990"," I want to get, you know, that's all I want to do."
"9396750","9397510"," That's my plan."
"9398330","9399910"," I want to have a house for my kids. "
"9400210","9401870"," I want to have them college paid for."
"9402030","9404470"," They're in homeschool so that I can get them into a good school."
"9405250","9409330"," Like all these things, responsibilities that I'm able to do now, you guys have whatever you want to"
"9409330","9409510"," do. "
"9410170","9414390"," I'm sure you guys have hopes and dreams and you can't always get to those dreams."
"9415050","9416290"," You think you can when you're young."
"9416450","9417450"," When I was young, I thought I could. "
"9417750","9422850"," When I was young, I was like, when I was young young, when I was in like 20s, not until"
"9422850","9425310"," I started to really realize in my 30s."
"9426990","9431110"," That it was more than likely never, it was going to be, everything is built for that."
"9431250","9435970"," Even mortgages, taxes are built for you to take out a second mortgage, third mortgage. "
"9436750","9444550"," The whole system is built for you to work for it, work for that system and then turn that wealth"
"9444550","9445870"," over to the next generation."
"9446650","9447410"," It's very hard."
"9447410","9454450"," It's not easy to earn something or gain something and keep it. "
"9455650","9457630"," Let alone have it make you the money thereafter."
"9457930","9459170"," It's a very difficult thing to do."
"9459230","9460790"," It's not fucking easy. "
"9461430","9463130"," It is so fucking hard."
"9464250","9468750"," And the greatest threat to it I've always found is debt."
"9469550","9474050"," Taking on fucking debt against your wealth to me personally. "
"9476370","9481170"," Always, eventually, you spin the wheel with that debt and it fucking gets you."
"9481610","9484190"," One, at some point down the road, it gets you."
"9484330","9486570"," And some people don't want to give their wealth to their kids. "
"9486730","9486930"," I do."
"9487390","9488090"," I love my kids."
"9488670","9489530"," I fucking love them. "
"9489950","9492770"," I love my wife, I love my kids, I love my dogs."
"9493690","9494910"," I don't know, you guys don't have to."
"9495210","9497250"," If you don't, then fuck it, run up that debt. "
"9498350","9499710"," I don't blame you for running up that debt."
"9500150","9502790"," Everybody has their own wants and needs out of life."
"9502790","9504170"," Some people don't care about making money. "
"9504310","9507470"," Just want to make just something worth your jobs and just fuck around."
"9507830","9508750"," And why do I day trade?"
"9508930","9512670"," It makes me extra money and it gives me something to do, right?"
"9512870","9513530"," I'm here with you."
"9513670","9514810"," I'm here trading every day. "
"9515330","9519430"," I like the, believe it or not, I get pissy at the soap opera of the stock market, but I"
"9519430","9520250"," was taking a shower this morning."
"9520290","9527210"," I'm like, eh, as long as you keep it where you don't, it's not impacting your trading decisions."
"9527990","9528750"," It's kind of fun. "
"9529010","9530370"," Think about any other profession out there."
"9530430","9535130"," Is there any other profession out there that has like the soap opera that goes on in the financial"
"9535130","9535650"," markets?"
"9536310","9538050"," It's like a total fucking soap opera."
"9538570","9544330"," I can't think of any other profession that's that public, huge, involves people of power. "
"9544790","9546150"," Like, it's a crazy thing."
"9547070","9549290"," So, yeah, I like that that's around, to an extent."
"9550210","9552170"," And I have to keep that in my mind. "
"9555440","9555960"," We're on."
"9556460","9556900"," Thanks, guys."
"9557080","9557580"," I appreciate it. "
"9564360","9565420"," Yeah, I think we trade down."
"9565560","9566520"," I think we're trade down."
"9569000","9570980"," It's that slow grind down. "
"9571060","9572300"," I should move this level up a little bit."
"9572300","9573660"," I guess it was off a little bit on that one."
"9582080","9583200"," And Vasco, what do you think?"
"9583460","9584580"," Let me know in the comments. "
"9587920","9588500"," Keysport level."
"9588660","9589380"," Summer stain cell."
"9589740","9590340"," That flows to 300. "
"9590540","9592560"," I think it's a touch of a bias, though."
"9592680","9593600"," It's 3900 level."
"9594860","9595220"," Yeah. "
"9596700","9598080"," We'll walk through the dogs, too."
"9600800","9603360"," Yeah, and you guys can find them through friends, too."
"9603540","9606220"," On, you guys can find mentors through friends, too. "
"9606260","9608860"," If you guys like people on Twitter, try to be nice to them."
"9609080","9611040"," Have private conversations with them."
"9611500","9615720"," You know, I'm friends with Jill with Joe Harper and Joe Donut. "
"9617380","9623400"," He, him and I talked once a week for an hour, a couple times of 15 minutes."
"9624620","9627080"," Some other guys out there, they talk to you guys on the phone here and there."
"9627080","9629160"," And that's because I will learn from you. "
"9629340","9631700"," And Joe says things to me that I don't think about all the time."
"9632820","9637220"," And because we have an outside viewpoint on life, because we have an outside viewpoint on stocks."
"9637820","9639800"," We talk about long term on different things. "
"9641860","9648540"," And so you become friends with people so that you can grow as a trainer, grow as an investor."
"9651760","9652320"," I'm a dick."
"9652480","9654280"," He didn't do it only because it last my past two weeks. "
"9655420","9659800"," Okay, you guys will be dicks to me on, you guys will be dicks to me on Twitter."
"9660220","9662740"," As long as it's all in fun or it's not, you got taken too seriously."
"9663320","9665560"," Some of you guys take it, take things fucking way too soon. "
"9665760","9667320"," Ooh, well, some shit you should take seriously."
"9668220","9670720"," Sometimes I see people on Twitter saying some really fucked up shit."
"9671640","9673360"," And I'm like, this is fucked up. "
"9673520","9675640"," Like, you know, you know, I'll say something."
"9676960","9682160"," But most of the time, from fucking around with you or dicking with you, don't take it personally,"
"9682520","9687680"," I'll be your best friend outside of money, Twitter, even here or whatever."
"9695030","9696050"," Oh, thanks, Garrett. "
"9698410","9698930"," Excuse me."
"9700130","9702050"," But you guys can see I trade at least, right?"
"9702170","9706350"," I haven't been streaming, so you guys don't have to be able to see me fucking trade, which sucks"
"9706350","9710010"," because normally when I'm trading, it's kind of hard."
"9710470","9714010"," Twitter is not the best vehicle sometimes. "
"9715490","9719650"," It would be better if you could live stream on Twitter, it'd be kind of cool."
"9720070","9726050"," But if you could live stream on Twitter, it could be a cool thing."
"9726450","9730190"," But like, this stuff right here, a day, like I get into the market and a day today and make"
"9730190","9734650"," money on a day like today and be in and out of the market and come back tomorrow for another"
"9734650","9734890"," day. "
"9734990","9737490"," If I wanted to take tomorrow, I'll not worry about my positions like that."
"9738310","9740390"," So that's the way this market's running right now."
"9740530","9740930"," This is what I'm doing. "
"9741370","9742550"," Going to this, not today."
"9742730","9747230"," I'm not having a good time today, but in the past, I've got into we could do it."
"9747230","9748010"," We could do it right here. "
"9748430","9754290"," There was a time in the stock market before volatility entered the market this year, whether it was"
"9754290","9757430"," going up or down, you could here."
"9757510","9758830"," Let me see if I can ask you guys something."
"9761110","9761990"," Give me a second here. "
"9762390","9763490"," One quick second here."
"9764830","9767590"," Just something I haven't chart out."
"9767750","9768070"," There we go. "
"9768230","9768310"," Perfect."
"9768750","9769910"," There's a blank chart basically, right?"
"9769910","9771150"," So let me just show you guys some."
"9771510","9772870"," There was a time in the market. "
"9773650","9782670"," If the market was going up, right, or if the market was going down, you could enter a trade, right,"
"9783410","9793370"," at the bottom for a length of time and you could enter here, let's say, and you"
"9793370","9794210"," could exit wherever you wanted."
"9794450","9796530"," You could exit here, you could exit here, you could exit here."
"9797110","9797810"," Everything was great. "
"9798550","9799870"," Same thing on the down, right?"
"9800550","9804810"," You come down here, enter this, and exit it as it went down, a trend."
"9806150","9808190"," And everybody made money, bull's bears are happy."
"9808670","9817230"," And then the rise of the algos, it's been worse in the rise of volatility, but also algos, what"
"9817230","9825450"," they're doing now is on a trend, you've got computers that are maximizing their own gains. "
"9827830","9834990"," And destroying an options life so that you can't really, really enter any longer, just like a long"
"9834990","9836650"," position or a short position."
"9837710","9842650"," And all of the intrinsic value of that option is just fucking dog fit by the time you get to"
"9842650","9845910"," the end of that life, that option, or the end of the life that you own it."
"9847150","9852670"," So those days are over right now in the stock market, which really sucks, but that's the case. "
"9853670","9858890"," So you see the rise of, not the rise, people have always done, but you see the rise of people"
"9858890","9865210"," trade and spreads because of this dog shit that we have going on in the stock market these days."
"9868310","9871350"," So yeah, so, I don't know, I don't know where I'm going with that story."
"9875750","9876450"," Hold on a second. "
"9882270","9888130"," But I guess that point is mostly that it's hard to trade the stock market any longer."
"9891430","9898370"," It's not an easy fucking place to trade the stock market, especially with naked options, even over"
"9898370","9905760"," a length of time."
"9906040","9909580"," Andy's saying good friendship helps you grow as a person too, hard to make real new real friends as"
"9909580","9909880"," an adult. "
"9909880","9912660"," You do hold on, I'm pretty sure you agreed with that 100%."
"9913960","9915660"," Thanks, Josh, for the discord invite."
"9920640","9922020"," Yeah, it's a scalpers market. "
"9922300","9925220"," I think you guys, you guys and I have been talking about this."
"9925340","9927160"," We had this conversation for the past year or two."
"9927580","9933900"," And I think you saw last week, you saw like the, and I think he's touched on the past, but"
"9933900","9938120"," Brett Kobeschau touched on the rise of the zero day trade or the rise of volatility. "
"9938900","9942300"," Some other guys out there have been talking about the rise of volatility for the past year, they've"
"9942300","9947180"," talked about it in the past year and the volatility of the market."
"9947500","9956060"," Some of it's the claim is that it's the volatility has been being bought since the first of the"
"9956060","9956180"," year."
"9956320","9959480"," But the reality is, in my view, it's computers all day long. "
"9959640","9961340"," In my view, it's algorithmic trading."
"9961960","9964380"," You've got computers that are going so fucking fast these days."
"9964380","9972520"," And every fucking fund and bank is using in these days that as a retail trader for you to survive"
"9972520","9974640"," in that environment is fucking brutal. "
"9975240","9976340"," It is brutal."
"9976560","9977440"," You can pick the direction."
"9977700","9982260"," You can pick the dip and your your positions just get destroyed. "
"9982640","9984580"," Just absolutely destroyed."
"9991500","9992460"," Another short."
"9993720","9994380"," Hey, Mero. "
"9994460","9995040"," Good to see you, brother."
"9995840","9996580"," Good to see you, Mero."
"9996700","9997140"," How you been, man?"
"9997900","9998860"," Well, as well, brother. "
"9999900","10000580"," Good to see you."
"10001320","10002360"," Good to see all the old."
"10002560","10009160"," Good to see many, many of the same names in this in this live stream today, because I wasn't sure"
"10009160","10012260"," if all of you have survived this market. "
"10012560","10014140"," Yeah, it doesn't matter if you're a bull or a bear."
"10014220","10014900"," This market's been brutal."
"10015860","10017400"," This year has been a tough one. "
"10017600","10020160"," This year has been tougher than many."
"10020900","10022020"," Absolutely tougher than many."
"10023780","10026020"," Do you ever think Algos will be banned?"
"10026840","10028740"," There's a bunch of ban on the needs to go on. "
"10030920","10031540"," It's hard."
"10031960","10038180"," You know, like I was talking about SoftBank on Twitter yesterday, I think, yesterday, maybe it was"
"10038180","10042520"," a couple nights ago or something, low the night commented on someone's comment on SoftBank."
"10043760","10045640"," SoftBank has come in and fucked with our system. "
"10046120","10047280"," Our system is rigged, right?"
"10048340","10049180"," It's rigged by banks."
"10050880","10053860"," They know before it's going to happen, where our markets are going."
"10055740","10058140"," It's hard to say that there's people of power. "
"10058760","10060420"," Every edge that they can get they're going to take."
"10060940","10062800"," Do I ever think Algos will be banned?"
"10063380","10063940"," Probably not."
"10064920","10068680"," I think if anything, there'll be more restrictions on the retail trader as time moves forward. "
"10069320","10075060"," I think the days of retail traders is going to go away at some point through restrictions."
"10076540","10081660"," It wouldn't shock me to see our system turn into something similar to Canada's Australia."
"10082040","10084980"," I think Australia and New Zealand have some heavy restrictions as well. "
"10085420","10088220"," I think that eventually there's a giant fucking bull flag."
"10088580","10089860"," You guys watching this?"
"10091420","10094160"," It's a giant fucking bull flag here."
"10098380","10100600"," A giant fucking bull flag forming. "
"10105950","10108450"," A giant fucking bull flag forming right here."
"10111110","10112930"," A giant fucking bull flag forming."
"10118830","10120670"," I'm going to take a trip around the market right here. "
"10127780","10128220"," Giant."
"10131680","10133420"," One, two, and three."
"10134780","10136060"," Nobody's short right now, are they?"
"10138820","10141380"," If this doesn't get reversed right here, what do you guys have to notice?"
"10141660","10146000"," If this doesn't get reversed right here, this doesn't get reversed right here. "
"10147080","10147800"," Very bullish."
"10150460","10151360"," Very, very bullish."
"10153680","10155380"," There better be a reversal right here. "
"10155460","10158700"," If there's not one, it's going to get very bullish here."
"10161540","10165140"," We'll scroll back and look at a book map right here."
"10176700","10178800"," There could be a squeeze coming up here, a big one. "
"10179260","10180040"," Big move right here."
"10184810","10186370"," There wouldn't be caught dead short right here."
"10188450","10189350"," This better fail. "
"10189550","10191210"," If you're bear, you better hope this fucking fails."
"10192390","10194610"," You better fucking hope this fails right here."
"10196190","10197670"," You want to see this right here. "
"10201060","10203160"," This is a critical moment in the market."
"10211810","10212730"," But you can't even see that."
"10213950","10217630"," You guys, for one of you guys, that was a critical point in the market right here. "
"10219450","10223210"," If you don't see failure, you're going to get a ripper."
"10226610","10228070"," You want to see this fail right here."
"10235960","10236520"," Hold on. "
"10236640","10237300"," Let me take a long here."
"10238960","10240680"," Let me get the petrol fucking bull."
"10242680","10243420"," Give me a second. "
"10247800","10249020"," 397s or 12 cents."
"10249020","10258080"," 395s, 395, 52"
"10258080","10264060"," cents."
"10270620","10271820"," Hang tight here. "
"10273080","10277000"," Let's see what happens."
"10279340","10280540"," Keep my eye on this book map."
"10280860","10282060"," So if you don't have a book map. "
"10285200","10285840"," Hey, back."
"10286080","10286480"," How are Bobby?"
"10286560","10287020"," Good to see you."
"10287640","10288680"," Hey, Doug, how are you doing?"
"10288820","10289440"," Good to see you too. "
"10291740","10293520"," You guys have been trading discord all along?"
"10293680","10294300"," You guys are savages."
"10296480","10298740"," So, Mero, you want to know what's up for the next trade, Bella?"
"10300060","10301280"," Chang is going to drag us lower."
"10301480","10302020"," I agree with that. "
"10304160","10308020"," I agree with the overall bearish viewpoint on today, Mero."
"10308020","10309880"," I think we're going down to 390 in the close."
"10310340","10315340"," It might have that death fucking, that death red candle down to like 385 on the bell. "
"10316960","10318540"," I want to see this fail right here."
"10318620","10319300"," If this doesn't fail."
"10320300","10323380"," If this doesn't fail right here, if we don't get a failure here. "
"10324280","10325100"," Just right here."
"10325160","10326620"," You want to see this big failure."
"10327120","10328200"," You want to see a breakdown. "
"10328840","10330580"," You don't see a breakdown here, right?"
"10331080","10332620"," This thing's going to the moon."
"10337000","10338100"," Things going to the moon."
"10338400","10338840"," Guaranteed. "
"10339300","10339740"," Guaranteed."
"10339740","10340580"," If this doesn't fail."
"10341880","10342640"," So, we'll see. "
"10342780","10344680"," We're going to go back to book map."
"10351310","10352550"," Yeah, I agree with that in Vesco."
"10364790","10365770"," Let's see what happens. "
"10368250","10369670"," All right, hold on."
"10375540","10378220"," Man, I want that fucking last little dip right there."
"10380760","10382900"," Oh man, I want to buy this so bad. "
"10383380","10384680"," I want to buy 395 Cs."
"10385480","10386180"," Hold on here."
"10397470","10399270"," I think I'm watching this right now. "
"10399770","10400090"," Hold on."
"10401950","10402710"," I'm getting a trigger."
"10402870","10403850"," We have a mid-two finger right here. "
"10424440","10424920"," Hold on."
"10425000","10425540"," I'm getting excited."
"10434010","10435290"," Still fucking heavy sellers. "
"10435550","10438970"," Do you guys look at the pie salad and the dome over on the right there."
"10439070","10439550"," It's not good."
"10441590","10442830"," 437,000 sellers. "
"10443070","10445550"," The 428, 437."
"10446470","10447110"," Pretty bad."
"10447410","10448090"," Even with the green balls. "
"10456300","10458040"," Man, I want to buy this fucking so bad."
"10458280","10458680"," I'm getting lit."
"10458780","10459180"," I'm getting that. "
"10459960","10460520"," I'm getting that."
"10460520","10461640"," Like, I want to buy it."
"10463220","10464260"," I want to buy it. "
"10467760","10468680"," I want to buy it."
"10469440","10469760"," Good."
"10469860","10470840"," I got to help sit in my hands. "
"10475160","10477340"," Yeah, so I was going to tell what John's saying here."
"10477420","10478900"," I want any of you guys that don't have a book map."
"10479100","10481480"," You can get a book map on trading view. "
"10481680","10482680"," I used to pay for book map."
"10483260","10485960"," I think I was paying like 350 or 360 bucks a month."
"10486500","10488780"," And I don't use it as much as I used to. "
"10489000","10493200"," So now I do mind through, um, I think, yeah, I think I swear."
"10494100","10497600"," Do mind to, uh, to think or swim."
"10498140","10501540"," I don't bother with, um, with paying for it anymore. "
"10501980","10503440"," I could, I could get it for free."
"10503760","10504760"," I don't have to contact them."
"10504980","10506040"," I'm just fucking too lazy. "
"10506960","10508960"," My wife was bitch and I turned off."
"10509300","10512300"," And I just used the free version with EAS and correlated for the cash market."
"10521090","10522070"," Tess is getting tight. "
"10522890","10523470"," DX is pumping."
"10525090","10527490"," Yeah, I'm, I think I'm going to take this trade."
"10528610","10529830"," I'm going to fucking take this trade. "
"10530470","10531030"," Okay, hold on."
"10534480","10538100"," I'm going to, oh, I'll measure into and put some tight stops."
"10545710","10546190"," Okay. "
"10547350","10549210"," All right, I am in."
"10551950","10556750"," I am in 395 C."
"10563220","10565300"," I'm going to show you where my stops are going to be."
"10567260","10567940"," I like that. "
"10568140","10568260"," Yeah."
"10570240","10571020"," Hold on a second."
"10572240","10573200"," I'm going to delete that. "
"10583180","10584760"," So these are my stops right now."
"10585040","10587420"," I see if I see we trade down below this white box."
"10588300","10589760"," I have its brief for a second. "
"10589900","10592240"," I might still stay in, uh, but I'm in 395 C."
"10595700","10596880"," So I want to see if this holds."
"10609850","10610890"," But you guys can't see."
"10611210","10612570"," Hold on, let me switch over so you guys can see. "
"10614350","10616130"," Um, so I am in right here."
"10616330","10617050"," This is where I was in."
"10617190","10618770"," This is where I bought right here. "
"10619970","10623110"," And I'm going to hold down to somewhere in here."
"10623430","10624790"," You start breaking down though."
"10625530","10627210"," I'll cut my losses down in here. "
"10630170","10631950"," But I like this idea of this."
"10632370","10634570"," So I want to see us push up that way."
"10636990","10638530"," So I am on the market right now. "
"10647070","10647830"," Let's go."
"10648970","10650190"," Let's make some fucking money."
"10651170","10653310"," Let's make some other fucking money. "
"10661480","10662860"," I got my price target above."
"10663660","10665040"," That was one of my price target above."
"10673640","10676800"," I don't know yet. "
"10681340","10683080"," I want to say it's somewhere right in here."
"10685420","10687240"," But I think it's going higher if it goes up here."
"10692360","10693020"," There we go. "
"10697080","10697980"," Let's see if this works."
"10700500","10703200"," I'm going to post it on Twitter."
"10713440","10713940"," Okay. "
"10714140","10714640"," 3950."
"10718280","10719080"," Tight stops."
"10729520","10730460"," Let's see what happens. "
"10741420","10745060"," I'll give you a second here or make sure I want to get fucked in this trade."
"10746940","10749300"," So see guys, no coming up to next week."
"10749300","10750480"," We don't have much news. "
"10751160","10752320"," We do have Biden today."
"10752320","10753000"," I forgot about this."
"10753160","10754020"," I forgot about this. "
"10754360","10755400"," This might impact the straight."
"10756040","10757760"," We have Biden speaking today."
"10757920","10758460"," I don't know what time. "
"10758980","10760480"," I think it was 3.30 in the afternoon."
"10760480","10761320"," I'm gonna look that up."
"10761900","10762520"," Biden speech. "
"10763760","10771860"," And then, I think it's at 3.30 this afternoon."
"10777500","10778700"," Sometimes they're late, too."
"10779420","10786140"," I think I can see where I'm at this period. "
"10788000","10788860"," Oh, shit."
"10789660","10790280"," Time is right now."
"10792600","10793220"," You know what?"
"10793320","10795080"," I'm gonna exit this trade, I think. "
"10795900","10801080"," We got a Biden speech coming up at 1.30. You guys know about this?"
"10803880","10808200"," We got a Biden speech coming up today at 1.30 in the afternoon."
"10810020","10810920"," So, you know what I'm gonna do?"
"10811140","10812240"," I'm gonna exit my trade right now."
"10816630","10817510"," A second. "
"10825900","10826640"," So, I'm out of my trade."
"10827000","10828140"," So, I forgot about this."
"10828200","10829140"," Yeah, quickly that happens. "
"10831500","10841030"," So, there's a Biden speech today at 1.30. Thank God I got out of that fucking trade."
"10843710","10844150"," Jesus."
"10845490","10845930"," Fuck. "
"10855110","10858550"," So, I'm gonna do is wait for that speech to start and then I'll take the trade long."
"10860510","10862250"," I forgot about Biden speech."
"10862870","10864510"," Why don't you guys talk about that inside the thing?"
"10867950","10868710"," Did you see that?"
"10868890","10871510"," Did you see it dip when I took this before I get out?"
"10872130","10874170"," Did you see how the fucking thing just dumped?"
"10882000","10883700"," Did you see how that shit just dumped?"
"10884060","10884640"," That's fucking wild. "
"10886220","10891970"," I was in and out for just a second."
"10893870","10897390"," A moment that I fucking sold, I fucking went straight red bar to hell."
"10900990","10901930"," That's just hilarious. "
"10902330","10903230"," Big giant red balls."
"10906390","10908410"," Good thing I got the fuck out of that trade."
"10910330","10914330"," But I'm gonna look for that speech at 1.30. I'll put it on for us. "
"10914430","10915070"," We can listen to it."
"10916810","10918450"," And let me see if I can bring it up here."
"10921290","10930940"," And I'll mute it until I see live filters"
"10930940","10931580"," live. "
"10933860","10935840"," Yes, I'll go back to that site."
"10936620","10937860"," Biden live."
"10940180","10942460"," Today, almost a second. "
"10943860","10946860"," And I don't want them when I want them dicking around."
"10950430","10955550"," All right, so there's a YouTube channel."
"10955650","10966980"," It's on the WhiteHouse.gov. We'll come back to it at 1.30. Good"
"10966980","10968260"," thing I got out of that fucking trade. "
"10970780","10973560"," Yeah, no, I got out right before that happened."
"10978000","10985000"," I pulled out of that trade before, so I pulled out of the trade right here."
"10986620","10987520"," Pulled out of that trade. "
"10987520","10991020"," I pulled the plug on this trade somewhere right in there."
"10991520","10996320"," Right before we dipped, before we blasted down, I got out of that trade."
"10996780","10997760"," And I'm flat right now. "
"11001060","11005620"," Normally, I would have stayed in this trade, but I'm not staying."
"11005860","11009520"," Normally, I would have just held this because we didn't break through this WhiteBox."
"11010940","11012060"," But I don't like the idea. "
"11012420","11016740"," I don't like, I always feel like when Biden's going to come talk, there's like weakness right"
"11016740","11018420"," before the speech, then we blast off."
"11018960","11024460"," Like every president, they fucking shit rainbows out their asses and tell you everything's going to"
"11024460","11024720"," be good."
"11025560","11030540"," Sometimes Biden's been a bear, but normally they ship rainbows out their ass and tell you"
"11030540","11031140"," everything's going to be okay. "
"11033860","11034560"," Yeah, they do."
"11035920","11037140"," So I went through Doug."
"11037140","11045140"," My, I went through my handle and found a bunch of people that use my posts on their hedge funds"
"11045140","11046160"," and shit, but whatever. "
"11051680","11057180"," Yeah, he's talking at, he's talking at what time?"
"11057580","11060100"," 1.30 in the afternoon, so sketching."
"11063640","11066080"," So we'll see, we'll see if this trades up anyways at any rate."
"11066300","11067300"," I'm not in anything right now. "
"11067580","11068660"," Normally, I would have held this rate."
"11068880","11071780"," This would be my, this is my box down below."
"11072160","11073380"," We'll see if it trades up higher here. "
"11074560","11076960"," I, I wouldn't have taken that trade with Biden."
"11082200","11083060"," So we'll see what's up."
"11084980","11085880"," See what's going on. "
"11086060","11087300"," I want to see something here."
"11094360","11096600"," Well, what do we have coming in for trades?"
"11101020","11110060"," Oh, when people are going along the market right now."
"11117420","11119660"," Some long trades coming to the market right now. "
"11125560","11127760"," That's closing its trade, rolling some trades."
"11128580","11130040"," We got, these are new long trades though."
"11133400","11139450"," It calls up to 48 cents now per minute. "
"11140130","11142330"," They were 43 cents and they went down in the 30s."
"11148950","11151290"," I'd like to see the speech start and then take that trade."
"11157410","11158810"," The trade is working fam. "
"11162930","11166230"," What happened to your lives and you, oh, you know what Jason, I don't even think about that."
"11166230","11168310"," I will get that back up and running for you brother."
"11168930","11171210"," I forgot about the lives news radio feed. "
"11171530","11173430"," I will write that down and I will have that going."
"11176130","11179970"," I will have a radio feed up for us Monday."
"11180250","11180910"," I promise on that. "
"11181910","11183590"," I totally forgot with the radio feed brother."
"11185870","11186750"," You help those calls?"
"11189150","11190290"," This is the trade."
"11190510","11192530"," Under normal circumstances, I would, I would take this trade. "
"11193610","11195750"," This would, this would be the trade right here."
"11196010","11196710"," I will get rid of that red."
"11201980","11203440"," Nice little bell bottom here. "
"11204720","11207660"," Jump up once here and this way right here."
"11212420","11216720"," And the only thing that would give me pause and caution is Biden speaking at 130."
"11219120","11229020"," As a matter of fact, I will put a 130 right there so we"
"11229020","11231980"," know that Biden speaking on that white vertical line. "
"11236170","11237570"," Any guys along right now?"
"11238230","11238810"," Totally understand."
"11242630","11244890"," The calls are up to 52 cents now."
"11249600","11250900"," Just need to break through. "
"11251240","11258900"," Just so you guys can see to see this, oh, I'm going to do it a different person."
"11259660","11263000"," I need to get another mouse to this computer."
"11263580","11267120"," So right over here you just want to see these sellers coming in putting pressure on. "
"11267680","11270880"," If we can break through these sellers right here, we will squeeze here."
"11271520","11272880"," We are looking for these sellers."
"11273820","11275980"," We are going to move this. "
"11278600","11280180"," These sellers have come down now."
"11280480","11281400"," We are going to move these down."
"11282180","11283540"," This orange box right here. "
"11283640","11288120"," We are going to move this orange box down because we know the sellers are trying to keep us down"
"11288120","11288380"," here."
"11288560","11292180"," We need to break above these sellers that have come in."
"11292660","11294240"," We want to see the break above here. "
"11294900","11298700"," Take this up so we want to make sure that see if that happens or not to get that rejection."
"11304780","11305520"," Let's see what happens."
"11307880","11309160"," Let's see if we get that squeeze baby. "
"11309460","11309880"," Squeeze it."

"11318100","11318580"," Here we go."
"11318800","11319120"," You guys ready?"
"11322420","11323420"," You guys ready for that squeeze?"
"11326880","11327720"," Get that squeeze going."
"11328140","11329820"," Push that squeeze up there. "
"11330180","11331340"," Push that squeeze up there."
"11332880","11335000"," Push that squeeze up there."

"11367790","11371310"," Tesla also has some moving averages coming in to help it."
"11372350","11373610"," You better fucking watch out. "
"11373830","11375090"," Tesla's about to make a fucking move."
"11375990","11377930"," Let's look around here and take a look at everything."
"11378110","11378490"," It's like a Dixie. "
"11386510","11387590"," Dixie's still there."
"11387690","11388890"," Can we kick it up again to move up?"
"11394180","11396200"," I'm going to see rejection on Dixie here."
"11397980","11399400"," Dixie's looking bullish. "
"11399660","11400100"," That's not good."
"11401000","11402680"," The HYG's telling a different story."
"11404900","11416920"," Come on baby. "

"11460790","11461950"," Guess and see where we're at."
"11467710","11469430"," Sellers do not want to give this up."
"11487470","11489590"," Make sure you have tight stops here in case we roll. "
"11490010","11494070"," If you are long right now, make sure you have some tight stops here because if we do roll this,"
"11494290","11496130"," if this does roll, it's going to get ugly."
"11497250","11499190"," It's going to get pretty fucking nasty."
"11501150","11508090"," Speed conscience of where it's going to go. "
"11509250","11510790"," There's your 390 down below."
"11515150","11516270"," This is what the Bears want."
"11516450","11518430"," Bears want this rejection right here. "
"11519310","11522670"," Bears want to take this rejection down into the clothes."
"11527260","11529460"," I want this to go up at least here."
"11531280","11533040"," Need to break through right here. "
"11549470","11550910"," Need a buyer to step in."

"11573880","11574900"," You guys can't hear me?"
"11574980","11575240"," Hold on a second. "

"11580320","11581580"," Is that better?"
"11582060","11583000"," Let me know if that's better. "
"11584020","11588260"," If that's not better, I'll slide the game."
"11588960","11590040"," See if that's better right there."
"11593700","11595220"," You guys have whiskey right now?"

"11688640","11689740"," Raise your stops up. "
"11691320","11693800"," 39371 or at least be ready to pull the trigger."
"11694480","11698420"," If you don't have stops, then we're going to raise them up to this orange box up here in just"
"11698420","11698980"," a minute, okay?"
"11701920","11702740"," Here we go."

"11728010","11729230"," Raise your stops up. "
"11731790","11741260"," I guess we should put those."
"11741400","11741740"," Squeeze them."
"11743880","11744660"," Squeeze them. "
"11745460","11747120"," Vwap is right where my cursor is."

"11785220","11785920"," Oh yeah. "
"11786140","11786640"," There we go."
"11787380","11788980"," There we fucking go."
"11789220","11789660"," Get up there. "
"11789780","11790520"," You fucking whore."
"11791780","11792920"," Get up there."
"11793140","11794240"," You motherfucker. "
"11801340","11802880"," Take some money off here."
"11802980","11803820"," You see this right here?"
"11803940","11805500"," This takes some money off."
"11805720","11807340"," We can always hit it again down below here. "
"11809540","11811300"," I should have stayed in that fucking trade."
"11816760","11817940"," Free money with Captain."
"11826230","11827190"," Oh yeah. "
"11832620","11833500"," Oh yeah."
"11834040","11835200"," Let's see how high we can go."
"11836880","11839840"," I want to switch back real quick so you guys can see, okay?"
"11841000","11842560"," You want to see where we are right now?"
"11844120","11845480"," You guys want to see a book map?"
"11847640","11848960"," Just pushing it right now. "
"11849160","11849500"," Pushing it."
"11850920","11852240"," Big giant green balls."
"11855140","11858160"," We'll see if this will hold on and give us another leg for another trip. "
"11860080","11862060"," Starting to get over it so you can see this."
"11862240","11864700"," You see this red right here."
"11865420","11868000"," We're climbing over it. "
"11868000","11869420"," And get a foothold."
"11870280","11871960"," I'm going to switch back over right now."
"11871960","11872880"," I want you to see, okay?"
"11873520","11875120"," We can grab a foothold up here. "
"11875160","11878420"," See this red orange box?"
"11879180","11880900"," We can catch a foothold right here."
"11882880","11883280"," Right?"
"11883440","11885340"," We can do a little bit of this right here."
"11885480","11886300"," A little bit of wiggie. "
"11887040","11889100"," And then wiggles this way and then bam."
"11889460","11890960"," One more move up higher, okay?"
"11895760","11897200"," I'm going to sit right up here, okay?"
"11897280","11898620"," I want you guys to see this right here."
"11899340","11904600"," You want to hold this orange box now, okay?"
"11905440","11909580"," And I'm going to switch back over to book maps so you can see it sitting on top of that"
"11909580","11910420"," orange box. "
"11911280","11912980"," You want this to hold right here."
"11914340","11915900"," Let's see if you can get another leg up."
"11930780","11934520"," We're going to see if you can put a resting bitch face on and see if it will take another"
"11934520","11934840"," trip. "
"11937780","11943540"," Now be careful here because if you're just trading the ranges, we'll switch back over so you can"
"11943540","11944040"," see the ranges."
"11945920","11947720"," So you see this range right here, right?"
"11947820","11951060"," We kind of see that bull flag that we're talking about right here."
"11952220","11958400"," We don't want to see is we don't want to see, you know, trade this up, trade this shit down,"
"11958500","11961560"," trade this shit up, trade this shit down, which can happen. "
"11962020","11968320"," We want to see, we want to see right here is we want to see this, you know, consolidation."
"11969360","11970500"," One more squeeze higher."
"11972020","11975740"," Now on these bull flags, when you see bull flag like this, you don't want to see the failure. "
"11976020","11976500"," That's bad bad."
"11977100","11977940"," That's going to be a big drop."
"11979280","11986320"," These bull flags, you really want to see like, you don't want to see these bull flags play out more"
"11986320","11989580"," than like two or three times, like one, two, three, go. "
"11990320","11992880"," One, two, and then go."
"11993220","11995560"," Like this should be a go higher, right?"
"11995820","11999280"," Or if it fails, you don't want to see this, this trend fail."
"12000180","12002360"," The third one would actually put you through and above. "
"12002740","12008520"," So we want to see if this, if we can get a nice break above here, sometimes only two, sometimes"
"12008520","12012460"," it's three, if after three tries that shouldn't going up, that shit's going to fail."
"12012760","12016660"," So it's kind of like a first try to break out."
"12018180","12023180"," We'll get, if it rolls, possibly get one more attempt at it. "
"12024060","12024740"," But we'll see."
"12026680","12027760"," That was a good chance of it."
"12029820","12031900"," Good chance of a squeeze higher even right here. "
"12033240","12035020"," The probabilities are getting on our sides here."
"12038560","12040280"," We'll go back to book map and see if it holds."
"12040560","12042900"," You see the green, the green, green balls are still there. "
"12044020","12045540"," So bulls are still in charge right now."
"12045580","12046400"," They haven't given it up."
"12046580","12056460"," We'll see if the bulls can be $94.94."
"12057480","12064840"," So that would be the price target to begin would be $394.94. And if you are going to get"
"12064840","12071600"," bullish from here or stay in the trade from here, what you'll do, what you'll be looking for is a"
"12071600","12072300"," move like this. "
"12073340","12074960"," A move up to VWAP."
"12076060","12076880"," More consolidation."
"12078280","12081220"," VWAP will come down and through and we'll start making a move higher. "
"12081220","12088680"," And hopefully Biden starts talking and says something positive and doesn't just fucking dump this"
"12088680","12088980"," market."
"12089300","12097160"," Be conscious as we trade into 130 in the afternoon that he can reverse this market just as quickly"
"12097160","12098400"," as he can make it go to the moon."
"12108440","12110280"," We'll see how this plays out here. "
"12111780","12113140"," I'll put it back on book map for you."
"12120740","12121580"," Yeah, free money Friday."
"12125520","12127440"," Totally to make some money together today at some point. "
"12132550","12133210"," Patience, baby."
"12133670","12134070"," Patience."
"12135890","12139490"," Take that money and make another fucking trade and just be like, I made my 20%. "
"12139490","12140290"," I made my 30%."
"12140290","12140770"," It's all I need."
"12141410","12146150"," You get fucking guys trade spreads that fucking take their 20% all the time and walk away. "
"12152430","12154010"," Just a little bit of rest and bitch face here."
"12154550","12154770"," Still bullish."
"12157250","12158170"," Still bullish here. "
"12169920","12171900"," I'm going to like fucking Biden speaking at 130."
"12173340","12174340"," We're getting close, right?"
"12174760","12176040"," Well, at this I'm going to be right back."
"12176160","12176460"," It's 115. "
"12176900","12178520"," I'm going to go get a whiskey to have a whiskey with you guys."
"12180120","12181660"," Yeah, they're trying to roll it over right now."
"12183980","12185080"," Trying to roll it. "
"12186600","12189160"," Trying to roll it for fucking doom, Biden."
"12193170","12193910"," So I'll be right back."
"12194050","12194570"," I'm going to grab a whiskey. "
"12194730","12195810"," I'll leave the stream's going to be up."
"12196190","12197410"," I'm just going to exit real quick."
"12198110","12200470"," Grab a glass with some rocks in it and put some bourbon in it as well. "
"12200590","12201770"," We'll be cocked all together for the other day."
"12202630","12203290"," Stay with me."
"12203330","12204770"," Please like, subscribe if you can. "
"12205690","12208790"," I'm going to be back here live stream with you every day."
"12208970","12213710"," So we'll get some trades in together and we're making some money."
"12213710","12215830"," Hopefully you guys got my tweet this morning that said, sell the open. "
"12215830","12217730"," Hopefully you did sell the open."
"12218030","12219970"," I'll be back in 10 minutes."
"12220590","12222090"," Stream will stay on right now. "
"12222710","12226670"," If you want, I'll put some, you know what I will, I'll put some I'll put something on the"
"12226670","12227590"," background to start."
"12229070","12229550"," Hold on."
"12229810","12231230"," Let me see if I can get something on the background here. "
"12233560","12243740"," So if you get, sorry, I told you guys can hear this percent."
"12244500","12244820"," Okay."
"12245360","12249160"," So that means that IVR, this IVR 59 is spiking. "
"12249420","12251800"," It has spiked in the last five days as well, right?"
"12252020","12253520"," So that's the best way I would do it."
"12253780","12254840"," I don't think there's a better way to do it."
"12255440","12257900"," Another way, another watch this is similar is you can go to tasty. "
"12258300","12263420"," You can go to taste turns out on the background and the taste fast members will tell you the stocks"
"12263420","12265760"," that are, that have a lot of a movement."
"12266040","12266380"," Stay in here."
"12268080","12268520"," Okay. "
"12268600","12270260"," Not necessarily spiking their IV."
"12270660","12274680"," This is more of a historical volatility metric because it takes a look at how much it's moving,"
"12274680","12279860"," which is realized volatility, not implied volatility, but it does tell you a little bit as well."
"12280260","12281420"," Hopefully that helps. "
"12283320","12284200"," Good question."
"12284420","12285200"," Indian likely event."
"12285460","12288040"," We are buying long calls or puts, of course, unlike certain. "
"12291200","12292080"," You guys hear that?"
"12292760","12298360"," Do you tend to buy around 90 days and roll days for the same reason we sell premium at 45"
"12298360","12298860"," days?"
"12299020","12299600"," Good question."
"12299760","12300660"," So, okay."
"12300880","12302100"," So you say you're saying we're doing small loss, right?"
"12302240","12302600"," Let's go back. "
"12303880","12307660"," So right now, right?"
"12308080","12309000"," This is a trade, right?"
"12309460","12311100"," We knew we said put tight stops on, right?"
"12311900","12315920"," So you take this trade right from here to here, right?"
"12316020","12317840"," Well, we took it from where we take it from right here."
"12318480","12319600"," It's like directional trade."
"12320540","12322560"," He said, take some off, right?"
"12322740","12323520"," But you can re-enter this trade. "
"12323680","12328340"," It's not like you can't re-enter for the next leg every time that it does this consolidation."
"12329960","12332560"," So what you're looking for now, if you're going to take the next, if you're going to take the next"
"12332560","12337280"," leg, what you do is you're going to look for the consolidation, right, in a reversal."
"12337600","12343020"," If you see this reversal start, finger on the trigger to buy that reversal somewhere above this"
"12343020","12344120"," channel. "
"12345060","12347580"," Right above this channel, you want to re-enter that trade again."
"12350420","12351840"," Right now, we're just going to have to be patient."
"12352260","12355380"," I'm going to grab a whisk of right back and I want to, I think I'm going to buy a"
"12355380","12356300"," dip on him speaking. "
"12357220","12360600"," So as soon as he speaks, I'll be in this trade."
"12363020","12373280"," I'm going to leave him with this Do"
"12373280","12375780"," you guys want to book map on or do you guys want the chart on?"
"12376280","12377340"," Does it matter to you guys?"
"12380520","12384080"," Do you guys want book map on?"
"12384080","12387040"," It's better to sell premium for other days and then worse to sell premium."
"12387760","12391380"," More than 45 days or less than 45 days or less than 21 days. "
"12391540","12395500"," The reason to do it is because 400, 800,000 middle ground is a risk to the reward."
"12396220","12403420"," And when you take it into the house, you want to be and subsequently, how much money you want to"
"12403420","12407060"," make in exchange for how much do you plan on taking profit on them?"
"12407400","12413520"," That being said, the premise now, or the road saying is going to be a presupposition of the"
"12413520","12416320"," following statement, what about buying puts and calls?"
"12416540","12419480"," Now you're not going to presuppose these better words to buy it."
"12419480","12419800"," Book map. "
"12421440","12425820"," So I'll be right back to your question."
"12426240","12427700"," I have an answer for you."
"12427760","12431240"," That's the first question that I'll talk to you about. "
"12431800","12438980"," If you want to sell premium for 90 days, you're going to be, you're going to be in a very"
"12438980","12439940"," slow moving trade."
"12440260","12442480"," That doesn't have a lot of volatility."
"12442500","12444720"," Your portfolio, same goes for long premium. "
"12444820","12447360"," In that case, you're not going to have a lot of volatility in 98 trades."
"12447580","12451160"," You're not going to have a lot of cost to the 98 trades because the fate is very low."
"12452180","12456160"," But conversely, if you buy an option at 90 days, that option is going to be pretty expensive. "
"12456840","12462660"," So the capital outlay for buying premium is pretty high at 90 days, but you're not going to see"
"12462660","12465540"," that much chip away at it in the first few days of that trade."
"12465920","12470460"," Conversely, if you buy an option seven days' expiration, you're going to pay very, very little for"
"12470460","12474940"," that premium, which means you're going to have a larger propensity to make a lot of money in the"
"12474940","12477240"," short amount of time if you have the move you were looking for."
"12477840","12481000"," But if you don't have the move you're looking for, you're going to see that option to roll very,"
"12481000","12481540"," very quickly. "
"12481800","12489140"," So again, it's actually the same thing as short premium, closer to expiration, higher risk, further"
"12489140","12492900"," from expiration, lower risk for both long and short premium traders."
"12493640","12500800"," Because remember, if there is risk to one side of the trade, the same risk exists for the opposite"
"12500800","12504420"," side of the trade, except the distribution of risk is different."
"12504620","12506860"," So for example, you're selling premium at seven days. "
"12507300","12507480"," Okay."
"12508720","12510980"," What's the risk to the long premium buyer?"
"12511520","12513260"," Okay, seven days, not much time."
"12513780","12514580"," It's a cheap option. "
"12514600","12516720"," So you may make a lot of money if you get the move right away."
"12517200","12520060"," But if you don't, you're going to lose a lot of money, you're going to lose a whole option very"
"12520060","12520300"," quickly."
"12520600","12521600"," So what do you think of that?"
"12521780","12531600"," When we lose here those words, high risk, but high the risk is the outlier"
"12531600","12531860"," move. "
"12532600","12537140"," But in exchange, if the outlier move doesn't happen, you make all the money, right?"
"12537520","12538560"," So here's the thing."
"12538900","12540520"," You're selling premium at seven days."
"12540900","12542060"," What does this look like?"
"12542380","12544480"," You get a lot of money very quickly. "
"12544640","12549000"," If nothing happens, but if something does happen, you're going to pay out a lot on an option"
"12549000","12553240"," because that $1 option is going to go to $10, and you're going to be out a lot of money."
"12554260","12556280"," What does that sound like high risk higher war?"
"12556680","12562040"," It's both high risk higher work for both the long premium and the short premium buyer or seller."
"12562900","12568180"," The difference is that the longer you go out in time, the risk is muffled for both parties. "
"12569760","12572760"," Just the type of difference for both parties."
"12572940","12576160"," That's why there's a difference between buying and selling premium."
"12576560","12577200"," Hopefully that helps. "
"12577400","12584020"," So all I have to say is that there's no better or worse way, but there's no better or worse"
"12584020","12584620"," time to sell it."
"12584740","12589500"," 90 days or 45 days, the question I would say is if you want to buy premium, are you buying"
"12589500","12593500"," it for a longer term hedge and you don't want to take a lot of fate of decay in the"
"12593500","12597820"," first part of the trade, but you're going to pay more for the option than go 90 days."
"12599060","12604940"," If you're trying to take a shot, then maybe go shorter term because that depends on what you're"
"12604940","12605540"," looking to do. "
"12606080","12608920"," If you're looking at hedge portfolio, go 90 days."
"12609080","12611220"," If you're looking to take a shot, go seven days."
"12613820","12623180"," Or maybe if you're looking to go long via a long haul, a longer term, for the S&P 500,"
"12623900","12631560"," then go longer term as well, because you're not going to put up as much capital as buying spy, but"
"12631560","12641610"," you're going to put way more capital up for that long option than you would All"
"12641610","12647330"," right, cheap strategy for a left to critic upside in the event we get a low volume short squeeze in"
"12647330","12649650"," something next week, looking at nearly 11% upside. "
"12652720","12655660"," ES had a November 24 2008."
"12657560","12664420"," Well, listen, like I was just saying, if you want to have a huge exposure for a very short amount"
"12664420","12668360"," of time, you should look no further than like the weekly long calls."
"12668400","12673780"," I mean, that's the best, if that's your conviction, that's the best strategy you're going to get,"
"12674000","12678960"," because it combines the low capital outlay of a long call. "
"12687440","12694560"," All right, forming a bottom here, just so you know, I do want you to see they're forming a bottom"
"12694560","12698820"," here coming into this Biden speech."
"12698940","12700540"," This is looking pretty positive right here."
"12700580","12701280"," I like this idea. "
"12701540","12702660"," We got one, two, and three."
"12702880","12703320"," I like it."
"12704880","12709420"," Bulls are trying to try to hold on here for a squeeze higher, so I'm still bullish here. "
"12710020","12711020"," I like the idea."
"12711480","12714800"," So far, I'm not seeing the danger except for Biden."
"12715400","12719880"," The only thing I'm seeing is that it doesn't matter if it's Biden, it could be anybody fucking"
"12719880","12722340"," Trump, it could be whoever the president is. "
"12724200","12728400"," I was able to see a squeeze up short to close."
"12731140","12735320"," So what I want to talk to you about was someone asked, I think it was Sarah asked about cash"
"12735320","12744500"," count or what did she say she had day trade, yeah, day trading restrictions."
"12746660","12754080"," So whatever you have day trading restrictions, you can only make, I think was it five or six, five"
"12754080","12758320"," trades and I don't know what it is, three trades or five trades in five days or something. "
"12758520","12758820"," I don't remember."
"12761920","12764140"," But I do have a solution."
"12765600","12768060"," It's not a legal solution. "
"12768960","12771780"," So this is not financial advice."
"12772640","12775160"," I'm going to preface this, but this is not financial advice."
"12775440","12780000"," But well, there's a couple of other prefaces. "
"12781500","12782720"," How do I want to say this?"
"12783080","12791640"," So the intent behind these rules is so that you are thinking through your trades"
"12791640","12800640"," that you're competent enough to take a live trade and with confidence that it'll be successful, the"
"12800640","12803520"," best confidence that you can have, that's going to be successful."
"12804360","12811480"," So that's meeting all these, I guess you could pay for trade until you're you're a high success"
"12811480","12821220"," rate and then you shouldn't have to worry about you shouldn't have to worry about if you're going"
"12821220","12822380"," to be successful or not, right?"
"12822580","12823660"," I guess that's that's the point."
"12823920","12833240"," So but the truth is that you are also taught bad habits of staying in a trade that's bad because"
"12833240","12838500"," your mind is telling you that you can only get so many trades in a week. "
"12838880","12841300"," You might not even know when to take the money off that trade as well."
"12842240","12844440"," So here's a prime example."
"12844780","12846860"," So just today, let's look at today, right?"
"12847080","12852580"," So let's see where day trade restrictions and let's say just right here, you were like, you took"
"12852580","12855600"," this trade down here and it started to go the wrong way. "
"12855700","12859340"," So the question becomes, let's say take a loss here."
"12859460","12860380"," That sucks, right?"
"12860680","12863240"," If you stayed in it, you could have come back to at least retest."
"12863680","12870620"," As a new trader, you probably don't know take your money back or whatever. "
"12871420","12876620"," So there's a couple of things you can always add if you if you're still convinced to this trade,"
"12876620","12879500"," you might want to just add to your position, right?"
"12881900","12884160"," Sometimes you add to positions when they're not going your way."
"12884700","12887640"," There's zig zagging, maybe like, oh yeah, I still have faith in this trade."
"12888260","12890780"," So I'm going to add here, I'm going to add here, I'm going to add here and I'm going to"
"12890780","12891160"," add here. "
"12892480","12895690"," Let's say it swings down for a minute but then goes back up."
"12896550","12902350"," You might get spooked and scared and sell your position, right?"
"12902510","12904930"," Because you only have so many day trades, you don't want to lose all your money because you only"
"12904930","12906730"," got a thousand bucks or 10 grand or some."
"12908570","12911810"," So you kind of like taught bad habits. "
"12912930","12917730"," I think that you're taught bad habits by those rules."
"12919050","12925870"," Because the truth is that if you let's say your trade's not immediately going let's say your trade"
"12925870","12927830"," is not going in the direction you want it to."
"12928010","12929190"," Let me get rid of this now for you. "
"12931470","12936490"," If the trade's not going in the direction you want it to, especially right away, let's say you were"
"12936490","12938730"," to take that goddamn thing, squeeze."
"12940490","12940930"," Amen."
"12941690","12946930"," So let's say this trade was started going bad immediately and you had day trade restrictions,"
"12947270","12951530"," you're going to probably, my guess is hold that trade and lose all your money. "
"12951910","12956970"," Whereas if you didn't have fair day trade restrictions, you'd cut your losses immediately and not"
"12956970","12958910"," stay in that bad trade over here, right?"
"12959890","12960730"," That's what I think."
"12962070","12964710"," So I think it's set up for you to lose all your money."
"12964990","12966150"," Look at that fucking squeezing. "
"12966790","12968750"," Now what's happening right here, right?"
"12968850","12971850"," We've broken out, right, of this channel, right?"
"12972630","12973630"," We've broken out, right?"
"12975110","12977350"," So what are we looking for here now that we've broken out?"
"12977550","12980030"," We're going to look for a little bit of this and then a push higher."
"12981310","12982970"," Hopefully Biden's going to be good to us."
"12983790","12988550"," So my, my thought processes are teaching you about habits. "
"12988730","12990810"," You're worrying about getting in and out of trades."
"12991130","12995590"," Traders get in and out trades all the fucking time, all the fucking time, especially if the trade"
"12995590","12996610"," goes your way in one day."
"12997050","12999930"," Let's say you take a trade and it goes up 200 points of the day and you're going to catch"
"12999930","13002770"," a day trade because you closed your trade before out of day. "
"13003350","13004350"," Get fucked, right?"
"13005390","13006090"," That's insane."
"13007250","13012450"," So my point to you is number one, we're going up baby."
"13013530","13015290"," We're burning up Eric. "
"13019810","13021470"," So my point to you is this."
"13022790","13024070"," It's a bad idea."
"13024270","13025530"," We're starting to get above this. "
"13025690","13028070"," This is a good we're we're bullish right here."
"13028150","13029130"," Just so you guys know, okay."
"13030270","13031550"," We're very bullish right here. "
"13033930","13037270"," So I don't have fucking what do you call it on?"
"13037370","13037830"," It's 130."
"13038630","13041170"," I'll bring, I'll bring Biden back up."
"13044350","13047070"," So I can't believe this is happening right now. "
"13052550","13062410"," Let's have a drink to pick in the right direction, which is three quarters, which"
"13062410","13065650"," is three quarters of the fight, right?"
"13067130","13067870"," He's not on."
"13068110","13070490"," No, it says, oh no, they moved it to two 45."
"13070970","13071950"," So we could squeeze more. "
"13072490","13074850"," They just moved it from 130 to 245."
"13075450","13076430"," They just bumped the speech."
"13076850","13077690"," He does this shit. "
"13077750","13078710"," I posted that yesterday."
"13079350","13084190"," He fucking does this shit where he'll be like 130 and then he comes on at 330 right at the"
"13084190","13084370"," bell."
"13085210","13085890"," This is hilarious. "
"13088210","13092870"," So yeah, we're going up."
"13092870","13094510"," They moved the fucking speech."
"13097250","13098770"," So we can't have doom. "
"13098990","13100130"," We're not getting vol right."
"13100390","13104610"," So the vol has gone away until later in the afternoon."
"13105290","13106230"," So there's no more vol. "
"13106390","13106890"," We should go up."
"13107430","13108050"," Just the heads up."
"13108050","13108750"," They moved the speech. "
"13110710","13114970"," So we should go up here because there's no volatility."
"13115390","13115970"," We need volatility."
"13116350","13116690"," We need speech. "
"13117050","13117470"," No volatility."
"13117770","13118090"," We go up."
"13124150","13129090"," So let's have a chairs to just so you guys can see chairs. "
"13129090","13133150"," I have it in a cup because I don't make my kids been knocking on the door all day."
"13133430","13135790"," I don't want to think I'm drinking this early in the daytime."
"13136430","13137250"," So cheers to you. "
"13138970","13139370"," Cheers."
"13139590","13141430"," Hopefully you guys are in that long trade."
"13141830","13144070"," Hopefully you guys took that long trade more risk than I do. "
"13144590","13145430"," You can always reenter."
"13145570","13146410"," It's probably not over yet."
"13150700","13152320"," He'd raise some stops up here. "
"13154280","13157700"," You want to raise your stops right here."
"13159400","13164020"," Well, you guys are you guys are buzzing it right there."
"13165100","13166400"," Raise some stops up. "
"13168180","13171100"," You'll have price target, of course, is this white box above here."
"13173300","13175440"," VWAP are coming into VWAP right now."
"13178080","13182240"," I'm going to put you back on book maps so we can see where book map is. "
"13184200","13186000"," End of the day you're here to make money, right?"
"13186240","13187960"," You're not here to fucking talk fucking bullshit."
"13188740","13190060"," You're not here to talk bear shit."
"13190260","13194520"," You're not here to fucking, you know, do all kinds of stupid shit. "
"13196640","13198020"," Use complicated numbers."
"13198180","13200260"," You're here to make money every day."
"13200720","13201780"," Pick the right direction. "
"13202320","13207780"," So back to the conversation about people Sarah was asking about if you have a day trade"
"13207780","13208240"," restrictions."
"13208740","13212840"," I can tell you if I had a small account, what I would do."
"13216680","13222840"," I would if I had a small account, I would go to tasty works and I would sign up for"
"13222840","13230840"," tasty works and I would create like 10 accounts, maybe 20 10 or 20 accounts. "
"13231520","13235280"," You can make you sign up once and then you can make like as many as you want."
"13235420","13242420"," You can make five 10 accounts and each one of those accounts will allow you to have your whatever."
"13242600","13244980"," I forgot how many fucking I don't know how many it is anymore. "
"13245160","13246020"," So I've forgotten now."
"13246060","13248040"," I used to remember but I don't remember anymore."
"13248340","13249300"," Five or whatever it is. "
"13252300","13252700"," Cheers."
"13256380","13262480"," And you can run and you can and what you can do is you can get the three PDDs or"
"13262480","13263580"," five or whatever it is."
"13264700","13270080"," You can burn like whatever your PDDs are and then take your money and switch it from account to"
"13270080","13275640"," account and you can burn count after an account after account and then come back and use them again"
"13275640","13277720"," and whatever it is 30 days 90 days. "
"13280040","13280960"," Whatever it is."
"13282380","13283160"," Is it three?"
"13283320","13283840"," I thought it was five."
"13285620","13286120"," I could be wrong. "
"13286640","13292040"," I fucking I haven't seen a PDT and I don't know if it's three or five."
"13292140","13292720"," I think it's five."
"13292900","13294340"," I think I think Tasty's five. "
"13294500","13295000"," I could be wrong."
"13296480","13297220"," I could be wrong."
"13297380","13298360"," I think it's five on Tasty. "
"13298560","13299800"," Maybe it's three on like Robinhood."
"13300060","13302500"," Whatever you do if you're out there fucking trading on Robinhood."
"13303440","13305600"," Not even weebles got great free charts. "
"13305820","13308120"," That's why I use weebles still is because it's free data."
"13308520","13309420"," It's fucking baller."
"13309880","13311700"," It's as fast as paid data. "
"13312360","13314700"," It's just as fast as any paid data out there."
"13317580","13321300"," I have like a Frankenstein trade set up that I use."
"13322080","13322840"," Here we go. "
"13323060","13323540"," Here we go."
"13323740","13324780"," Keep on squeezing baby."
"13325280","13326100"," Keep on squeezing. "
"13327400","13329000"," Keep on squeezing."
"13339800","13340940"," I'll put pimp it up."
"13346000","13347940"," So you're seeing so we're coming up. "
"13348060","13350100"," So you see in the moving averages in the one minute, right?"
"13350100","13352600"," That's like on the five minute moving averages, right?"
"13353720","13355160"," We've got VWAP right here."
"13355320","13357200"," We've got a 395 15."
"13357920","13361160"," We've got some now we've got some above targets in the five minute chart, right?"
"13361920","13366540"," If we can hold this if we can hold VWAP, we don't reverse immediately off VWAP. "
"13367140","13369280"," The next targets above are right up in here."
"13369560","13372400"," 395, 85, 325, 94."
"13374260","13378140"," I would like to see us consolidate here if we could. "
"13380400","13384860"," And then make another leg somewhere up in here."
"13386200","13387180"," We'll see how that goes."
"13388100","13390940"," So anyways, what you do is you get yourself like fucking five or 10. "
"13391060","13395520"," I don't think you can do that and like fit on Facebook on fucking Robinhood."
"13396100","13400200"," So you don't have to trade on tasty works right away."
"13400920","13405160"," You just sign up for it and then watch some YouTube videos. "
"13405360","13409980"," It'll teach you how to make trades on tasty and when you feel confident, you can take trades on"
"13409980","13410160"," tasty."
"13411140","13412000"," You'll feel it right away."
"13412160","13417880"," But just get the process started, get out of whatever you're whatever you're in, whatever I make"
"13417880","13419120"," most of my trades on tasty. "
"13419180","13425120"," I have other accounts, spreads I do on some of my spreads, I do on options.ai of I fucking"
"13425120","13425520"," ate them."
"13426560","13432060"," And for a time, I was still doing some spreads on Robinhood is actually pretty good on spreads, I"
"13432060","13432260"," think."
"13433040","13434620"," I think they're filled suck. "
"13434800","13438500"," They're order flow sucks, payment for order flow sucks on Robinhood."
"13438720","13442420"," So and and also spreads are great on tasty."
"13442880","13448220"," So if you can make this full switchover and get out of whatever you're in, I always recommend tasty"
"13448220","13451440"," as my preferred trading platform for all my trades. "
"13452240","13454520"," So I feel like if I had one, two trade out, it would be them."
"13454800","13461700"," Plus, I got to tell you something like the customer service, they don't they don't they don't I"
"13461700","13462480"," don't know."
"13463440","13468980"," I'm not a paid tasty works, pump or anything. "
"13469760","13478280"," But I've had trades where I've lost thousands of dollars where like the site went down and they"
"13478280","13479220"," refunded me my money."
"13479480","13482420"," I've had nothing but stellar customer support from them."
"13482840","13485820"," And when you go to a good broker, they do have paid order flow, which sucks. "
"13486700","13491220"," The only other thing to tell you in paid order flow is you want to go to a prime bank"
"13492000","13493420"," that's not pay for order flow."
"13495800","13500660"," Now, so if you were one of those people that are like, I want to buy, I don't know, GME"
"13500660","13503820"," or something, always go to a prime bank for that kind of stuff."
"13504120","13510120"," But outside of that, they're the cheapest they do the best job of being an order flow flow broker"
"13510120","13512980"," like my fills are excellent on tasty. "
"13513720","13522580"," I have run bid ask fills on multiple platforms in the past, at the same time to see what my"
"13522580","13523200"," fills would be."
"13523640","13528940"," And I've had very good success with tasty, even though they do buy their or pay for order flow."
"13530400","13536060"," It's not as bad as other platforms, but their customer service is fucking next to none. "
"13536120","13540740"," I've never had a better fucking experience than fucking tasty when it comes to."
"13542700","13547280"," So we'll see if this, see this nice little see if this sits right here and we make another plug"
"13547280","13549900"," higher and this consolidation."
"13550980","13553120"," See, we did get close to V well. "
"13554040","13560680"," So what I wanted, so anyways, if you have if you have a day train restrictions, PDDs, just get out"
"13560680","13562400"," of with a fucker use and go to tasty."
"13563340","13565560"," That's create like 10 account, you it's one account."
"13566240","13575020"," And then you can create a cash account or a or a whatever you call it's called, whatever the fuck"
"13575020","13575740"," the other counts called. "
"13576660","13580340"," I'm tired, I've been up since fucking four I'm trying to get this stream up and run."
"13582000","13582940"," Okay, so what do we got here?"
"13583200","13586220"," What's kept saying it's true, but don't do it as a new trader."
"13586660","13588460"," Yeah, squillion makes a good point. "
"13588880","13595480"," If you're a new trader, if you're a new trader, you should be confident in your trades."
"13595820","13599740"," I'm not trying to just, what I'm trying to only think of point that I'm trying to make is that"
"13599740","13607380"," I know for a fact that I used to stay in trades worrying about PET restrictions and you need to"
"13607380","13609320"," learn how to get out of trades."
"13609760","13616840"," One of the real bad habits that traders have is that they stay in trades that they know they have"
"13616840","13617700"," to have to get out of. "
"13617960","13620940"," They don't set stops on their trades."
"13621080","13626440"," They don't fucking get out of trades if it's not going in the direction they want it to."
"13626980","13631740"," Like when you place the trade, I'm not saying like the first minute or two, I'm saying like if"
"13631740","13636280"," you're not directionally going, like you shouldn't be buying, you shouldn't be catching swords and"
"13636280","13640000"," you shouldn't be fucking well, you can, but there's easier trades. "
"13640700","13646300"," The example would be that TI that we looked at, so we really get the signal right over the course"
"13646300","13646660"," of a year."
"13649240","13651060"," This is an uptrend stock."
"13651380","13653080"," You want to be buying a stock like this. "
"13653420","13654880"," This is called not catching knives."
"13655600","13657720"," It just consistently goes up and you sell tops."
"13658300","13660920"," You buy bottoms, you sell tops over the period of time. "
"13661240","13666380"," If you're going to want to catch knives like a Tesla catching knives, I can show you exactly what"
"13666380","13670940"," to be looking for to catch knives on a Tesla or what to expect out of catching a knife on"
"13670940","13675560"," Tesla and what to be looking for catching a knife on Tesla are stock that's in decline."
"13677020","13685800"," But the reality is the point that I'm trying to get to is you should at least not learn the"
"13685800","13687540"," bad habit of staying in a bad trade."
"13687940","13692620"," You should know to get out of a bad trade, take your licks and say that was a bad fucking"
"13692620","13692900"," trade. "
"13693600","13695460"," This isn't fucking, this trade didn't work."
"13695460","13697280"," I didn't pick the right fucking direction."
"13697680","13699420"," And sometimes they're in the right direction. "
"13699520","13701520"," Like let's look at Spy right here."
"13701700","13703360"," Let's look at this move right here."
"13703680","13707500"," And you can see just this movement right here. "
"13708000","13714300"," You could have got, you could have picked the right direction and still yet have not picked the"
"13714300","13715020"," right entry."
"13716000","13719020"," You always want to be picking the right entry in this trade."
"13719480","13723400"," You can get in, get out, get in, get out, get in, get out, and just capture that. "
"13723900","13727500"," Or you could have bought just a call spread for a little while and ran this up to this point"
"13727500","13727900"," right here."
"13728220","13733320"," You could have taken a weekly out or a monthly out and captured just 10% on that what we're"
"13733320","13736540"," probably about 10%, like 5% or some for that move right there."
"13736820","13741720"," But a lot of your trading is picking the right fucking direction, making sure that you're in the"
"13741720","13746340"," right direction and then picking the right entry within that direction and then knowing how long to"
"13746340","13747680"," hold it before you get out of it. "
"13747960","13749480"," You need to know that stuff before."
"13749740","13752160"," You should be paper trading this shit until you do."
"13753160","13753560"," Right?"
"13753840","13758260"," You need, you need to be able, you need to be able to know when to enter, when to exit,"
"13758740","13761620"," to know if you're on the right track, right?"
"13762720","13763940"," So you can get max gains. "
"13764220","13765320"," Like here is dangerous, right?"
"13765420","13767520"," We can end up selling this straight down over here."
"13767900","13772300"," And you should have a plan, right, to exit here so that if you're going to be like, hey, what's"
"13772300","13774500"," my next entry into this trade, right?"
"13774700","13775300"," Is it up here?"
"13775660","13777020"," Should I have entered the first time here?"
"13777100","13778240"," No, it was back down here somewhere."
"13778240","13780540"," Or some confirmation over here. "
"13781380","13783840"," Or just this leg right here, right?"
"13784020","13787500"," But now that we're trading down right here, what you should be thinking forward, like where do I"
"13787500","13788200"," want to make entry?"
"13788580","13792860"," Let's say you're like, okay, I want to, so like, you're like, okay, I want to now enter here."
"13793360","13795180"," I'm hoping that it comes down here."
"13795940","13798780"," And let's say it doesn't, let's say it stays here and continues higher. "
"13800040","13801460"," And you missed this trade."
"13801880","13804940"," Well, that's because you made rules for yourself, right?"
"13805200","13809740"," If it doesn't meet my rules, I'm not going to enter it, right?"
"13809880","13811640"," So you have to develop that as a new trader."
"13813080","13814360"," So you might miss this trade. "
"13814620","13816460"," You might have, you might miss this at this point."
"13816800","13817240"," Does it make sense?"
"13817860","13822520"," So if you're, so if you have all these rules for yourself as a trader and you're paper trading and"
"13822520","13826740"," you've got a small account, this is what you have to do."
"13826880","13831400"," Now, if you have a small account, you want to grow a small account, I can tell you at some"
"13831400","13837900"," point, we'll talk about how to grow that account safely. "
"13837900","13840820"," It's easy to grow a small account, so you don't have to worry about PETs."
"13840940","13845040"," If you're, if you're disciplined and patient, it's very easy to grow that account."
"13846000","13850600"," I'm starting to break below right here, this trend in some trend reversal here. "
"13850640","13854660"," Be careful if you're a bull on that trade, if you're bullish on that trade, be careful."
"13856660","13862580"," There are ways to grow a account very safely that you could have made money this whole entire year,"
"13862700","13863240"," just taking one."
"13863380","13864940"," Who does this chase winters?"
"13866020","13873280"," I think does this trade now, but if you're just patient, there's easy ways to grow an account where"
"13873280","13875160"," you're not day trading in and out every single day. "
"13875900","13877940"," Whether the market goes up or down, it doesn't matter."
"13878760","13880200"," I've made videos on this the past."
"13880500","13883600"," I'm not going to talk about today because a bunch of people listening right now already know about"
"13883600","13884060"," this stuff. "
"13886820","13893260"," But if you don't want to learn that bad habit and you're not paper trading anymore, you're actually"
"13893260","13893820"," live trading."
"13894480","13897780"," I don't see any fucking reason why you should be held back by PETs."
"13897900","13904400"," I am against, for the PDT rule in theory, in execution, I think it teaches bad habits to traders. "
"13905660","13906620"," That's a tough spot."
"13907700","13908680"," It's a tough spot."
"13910660","13911840"," I'm going to get rid of this. "
"13911940","13913040"," Looks like we're getting some failure here."
"13913860","13914500"," Close that up."
"13920660","13922100"," Did I get my wine here or no?"
"13922400","13922920"," Go on here. "
"13931970","13933730"," See if this thing maintains or not."
"13935990","13938350"," I clean up some of this mess in this chart too."
"13939790","13943570"," If you're a new trader, I mean, yeah, who made that comment?"
"13944410","13945450"," Yeah, squillion made that comment. "
"13949630","13951050"," Buy Biden did start a speech."
"13952570","13953710"," Hey, Carl, how you doing?"
"13954370","13955010"," Biden's on."
"13955690","13956490"," Put him back on here. "
"13959070","13968510"," If there's any delay in this broadcast for you, you can go down to the, you can go down to"
"13968510","13973770"," the little gear icon on your YouTube and you can speed up the broadcast."
"13975270","13981390"," You can speed up the playback and it'll eventually catch back up to real time."
"13981390","13990790"," And I don't have 10, 8 tower HD video today, but I will work on getting that back up and"
"13990790","13991050"," running. "
"13991290","13991470"," I don't know."
"13991650","13993530"," I think it gets reset on OBS."
"13996870","13997870"," Here's the way that's. "
"13998690","13999910"," What's he saying right now?"
"14003690","14004330"," That's weird."
"14004450","14004910"," I don't have it."
"14004990","14006270"," I don't have it live right here. "
"14011490","14012390"," For some reason."
"14017410","14023990"," I'm kicking in now by taking action in real progress and strengthening and stabilizing our economy,"
"14023990","14027330"," giving Americans across the country some breeding room."
"14027950","14031430"," Billing this progress is not just acting, but it's listening. "
"14032230","14033610"," That's why I'm here today to open."
"14033910","14039350"," He opened a good idea as to continue bringing inflation down and continue creating an economy and"
"14039350","14042890"," work for everyone with these business and labor is in front of me here."
"14043570","14049710"," Folks in this room, American labor unions, American companies are keen to build an economy from the"
"14049710","14050910"," bottom up in the middle of it. "
"14051050","14051470"," Let's see here."
"14052010","14057030"," I look forward to getting some weirdness and hearing their thoughts about things I should do and"
"14057030","14058070"," should not do."
"14058690","14062930"," What do you think you're strengthening American economy and about having to work together all"
"14062930","14063390"," forward?"
"14064350","14064710"," Good to"
"14064710","14089650"," see"
"14089650","14089710"," you, Abraham. "
"14089730","14089750"," Oh, yeah."
"14089750","14091510"," So that was, that was a whole nothing burger, huh?"
"14095150","14098330"," So I thought it said, I thought it was Biden and Yellen."
"14099150","14100570"," That was speaking. "
"14101170","14102890"," Abraham, a confirmor tonight, Yellen was going to speak."
"14111680","14113200"," Yeah, I'll be honest with you guys."
"14113360","14116640"," It wasn't a fan of Trump, but I loved him as a trader. "
"14117740","14120420"," The best president ever for a trader."
"14122040","14123580"," I had to wear two hats with that."
"14123980","14129280"," Like one hat of favorite president to ever to pump the markets and I didn't like him on the main"
"14129280","14129840"," street hat. "
"14130280","14131820"," Like a trader hat, main street hat."
"14133000","14138160"," I don't think it sometimes don't realize that the like new traders don't remember that."
"14143620","14144880"," Yes, that was over, right?"
"14145100","14145640"," That's over now. "
"14145740","14146440"," It's a big nothing burger."
"14150250","14153230"," I don't mind voting for Republicans either."
"14153530","14161910"," I just, I feel like both parties are going fucking batshit crazy fucking like,"
"14161910","14171730"," I'm like a pretty, I'm like a progressive gun toder, but like they everything"
"14171730","14178310"," now is like like with the main street hat on, like my, hold on a second here. "
"14180090","14183610"," Oh no, hold on a second, oopsie, going out here."
"14185450","14187110"," Hold on, we're technical difficulties."
"14191550","14196970"," It's like our main street hat is like, the main street like voter hat is like, everything's meant"
"14196970","14197850"," to divide all of us. "
"14198010","14198650"," It's so insane."
"14199710","14205230"," It really is like, it's built to like get us screaming at each other."
"14208250","14209570"," It's so fucking bizarre. "
"14217960","14222000"," Yeah, that's, that's my, that's my, um, that's my take on it."
"14225700","14235560"," It's, and of course there's, it's bizarre too because you know, like, I don't like"
"14235560","14245520"," talking about this stuff ever, but it's almost like not, not only do they divide us, but then"
"14245520","14251820"," they're amplifying bad habits from both sides of the division too."
"14252840","14252980"," Right. "
"14253940","14263620"," So, um, I could list them off, you know, uh, like even like guns like, I remember when I was"
"14263620","14265560"," young, it wasn't a gun culture."
"14266300","14273360"," Um, and now there is, and you know, some of the, some of the gun culture, uh, is fucking toxic"
"14273360","14274860"," and it's fucking gross."
"14275160","14276340"," Like I'm sorry, it's fucking gross. "
"14277060","14282820"," And I'm a, I'm a veteran, you know, uh, but there's a part of it that's like been amplified, you"
"14282820","14282940"," know."
"14283760","14289680"," Um, so there's like, there's like amplification too in, and then there's things Democrats do that"
"14289680","14290820"," is amplified."
"14291500","14293500"," It's just too much, you know. "
"14294480","14297140"," Um, I don't want to get into this conversation because it's politics."
"14297140","14298480"," I don't like fucking talking politics."
"14299820","14301100"," I honestly don't. "
"14301520","14301880"," All right."
"14301960","14306920"," Cause I've got, that's the other thing is I've got my trader hat on and my trader hat completely"
"14306920","14309600"," disagrees with everything in my main street hat."
"14310300","14318460"," Uh, and once you become a trader, it should and it does, it impacts, um, you as a trader because"
"14318460","14319360"," this is how you make your living. "
"14319360","14324080"," And so you're kind of like trying to balance that looking to see if you can get a bounce here."
"14324200","14327120"," One, two, three, I'm going to, I'm going to go along here, I think."
"14327720","14328280"," Let me see here. "
"14334690","14336390"," It's hard to have both of those hats."
"14336650","14345250"," You, you can't trade or invest with your money without having those two hats."
"14345810","14347450"," Uh, it's a struggle. "
"14348250","14349510"," It's not an easy thing."
"14350110","14356170"," Uh, some people, I've heard people in the past say, you know, I do bring my politics into my trade"
"14356170","14360690"," and I think you can, but I think, uh, it's irrational."
"14361390","14366930"," And I think you have to be very rational, uh, as a successful investor and trader. "
"14367830","14371890"," Uh, I think you can have some, some values and stuff and say, hey, I'll never buy that company."
"14372270","14374990"," I think there's like, but I think there's like a gray area, right?"
"14375250","14375970"," I think it's black and white."
"14376070","14378390"," I think like, hey, I don't like guns or something. "
"14378390","14380090"," So I'm not going to buy Lockheed Martin."
"14382170","14383490"," I respect that."
"14383650","14385610"," There's all kinds of other trades out there for you. "
"14386630","14392580"," Um, so I can respect that stuff, but it's bizarre."
"14393080","14400440"," Uh, because we know, of course, I wasn't a fan of Trump, but as a stock trader, he was fucking,"
"14400720","14406180"," I've never seen a president pump and dump the market."
"14406740","14409020"," Uh, get an overnight. "
"14409520","14415900"," The guy would dump a market in the overnight by like four or five percent and then fucking rip it."
"14416140","14416920"," Eight, nine percent."
"14416920","14419420"," Like seriously, we had circuit breakers. "
"14419900","14424460"," We were having circuit breakers at one point two, three times a week."
"14424460","14426240"," I remember it as I remember it."
"14426680","14433020"," I don't know how many of you were trading when we had the COVID crash, but that shit was fucking"
"14433020","14436240"," wild out of fucking control. "
"14437160","14442970"," Uh, crash and then, uh, the rip."
"14443310","14444410"," I mean, it was insane."
"14445010","14453090"," If you weren't trading at that time and you see declines now or rips now, like 100 point runs, you"
"14453090","14459630"," think 100 points a day, 200 points a day talking about like three, four, 500 points in like an hour"
"14459630","14462350"," or two before we even opened the market. "
"14463070","14465190"," We could be down like three percent in the market."
"14465610","14467950"," By the time the market opened, we were up like two percent."
"14468190","14469650"," Like we'd swung five percent. "
"14476570","14477870"," It was bizarre."
"14478690","14481950"," So as a trader, an investor, you was stood to make a lot of money."
"14483070","14489710"," Uh, so it's hard not to be like, ah, like, you know, your brain is like, and some people like"
"14489710","14491050"," them and like trading too. "
"14491370","14494790"," So I can't get another bad sample for those people either, you know, whatever."
"14495550","14497970"," Um, but as a trader, you have to have that."
"14498050","14502270"," It can't be like, yeah, I'm not going to take that trade because fucking Trump's going to pump the"
"14502270","14502490"," market. "
"14502490","14504410"," You have to trade along with what he's doing."
"14504990","14506630"," Uh, same thing with Biden, right?"
"14506770","14513510"," Biden tends to be, uh, not a, I've seen him pump and dump the market a little bit here and"
"14513510","14520410"," there, uh, but just not on the scale of, uh, the last president."
"14522110","14526170"," And you know, this was a stock pump or was, uh, uh, was Reagan. "
"14526770","14528850"," And that's, that's, that's actually the fear."
"14529250","14533210"," That's the fear they have for the next presidential election."
"14533570","14534610"," I think bears don't know that. "
"14534770","14538550"," I think bears, um, they're, it's weird too."
"14538650","14544930"," It's weird to see bears that like are politically leaning towards, uh, uh, like let's say Trump or"
"14544930","14549650"," Republican, if you get another Trump or Republican like a Reagan, this fucking market's going to"
"14549650","14550210"," the fucking moon."
"14550410","14551050"," I guarantee it. "
"14551710","14552230"," 100%."
"14552230","14559790"," So I don't know why sometimes how the politics mixes on, uh, unlike fin twit, just even trading in"
"14559790","14565690"," general or, uh, like when I see a bear that's like, uh, I want like a Republican look at an"
"14565690","14569810"," office, I'm like, you do realize that your, your bear fantasy is over, right?"
"14571950","14575490"," You get a market pumper that comes in, uh, they're going to fix the economy."
"14575710","14578410"," The market's going to go straight fucking straight to the fucking moon. "
"14579870","14580250"," 100%."
"14580250","14581750"," Okay."
"14581870","14583370"," So how do I see the end of the day playing out?"
"14588250","14590630"," Uh, how do I see the, the end of the day playing out?"
"14590990","14591190"," Yeah. "
"14591350","14594390"," So if you're buying zero dates here, uh, you should be in and out of those trades."
"14594770","14601010"," Do not ever be fucking holding zero dates, especially after one o'clock in the afternoon as the"
"14601010","14603310"," data burn and those things is going to be insane."
"14603710","14604110"," It's directional. "
"14604570","14606930"," Remember jump in, direction, get out."
"14608830","14611390"," In the direction of course is down here waiting to see if this is holding."
"14612870","14615230"," Uh, and what do I think is going to happen in the day?"
"14615770","14617090"," Uh, you want to know what I think is going to happen. "
"14617090","14622470"," Let's take a walk around the, uh, the stock market and see, uh, what I think is going to happen"
"14622470","14622950"," in the day."
"14625820","14629240"," Let's take a walk around the stock market."
"14632220","14633380"," That's bear town up here. "
"14633540","14634300"," We don't want bear town."
"14635180","14637480"," Uh, Dixie looks like it's getting some legs, right?"
"14637680","14638720"," They want to buy Dixie, right?"
"14638820","14640240"," It looks like buyers are here, right?"
"14640740","14642440"," We're not selling Dixie, are we?"
"14643180","14646780"," So this is, this is my previous, uh, previous trade week."
"14647060","14648720"," Now this looks like bottoming, right?"
"14649580","14651880"," So Dixie looks like it's going to be strong into the close. "
"14652240","14653040"," So I'm going to start there."
"14653300","14654220"," You guys want to go into the day."
"14654720","14656960"," So I got my, I got my fingers here, right?"
"14657740","14659240"," Dixie looks strong and into the day. "
"14659540","14662100"," That's what it looks like, right?"
"14662320","14663400"," It's been bouncing around in here."
"14664960","14668440"," Buyers, sellers, buyers, sellers, buyers, sellers, buyers."
"14669120","14672120"," You got some moving averages coming in to help Dixie, right?"
"14672640","14673700"," That's the first thing I'm going to look at, right?"
"14675000","14677820"," Look at how HYG looks like it's rolling over, doesn't it?"
"14679420","14686080"," HYG sometimes J.K. HYG will sometimes tell me before it happens in the market where we're headed. "
"14687020","14689560"," Kind of looks like, kind of looking bearish to me, right?"
"14690200","14691940"," Got a big bear flag kicking around here."
"14693180","14694680"," It's a big bear flag, right?"
"14695960","14698680"," It's not a fucking bull flag, right?"
"14698880","14699560"," Real basic trading."
"14702200","14702600"," It's possible. "
"14704220","14706800"," This looks like it wants to break down, right?"
"14708320","14711240"," So it's like it wants to move down into the bell."
"14712280","14713200"," HYG is a good indicator."
"14713440","14714820"," I swear the market's headed into the close. "
"14716060","14721060"," Look at J.K. J.K. is showing us that it's rolling over."
"14721480","14722640"," Get some gaps to fill down below."
"14723980","14725500"," That's not good for the market. "
"14725800","14729200"," So I've got two, two to three negatives."
"14729500","14731140"," I got Dixie telling me no."
"14731520","14733560"," I got J.K. telling me no. "
"14734160","14735660"," Get HYG telling me no."
"14737720","14741740"," You got the VIX forming a bottom over here, right?"
"14747530","14750930"," VIX is bottoming out, looking kind of bullish."
"14758470","14765060"," Yeah, it's not looking that bullish. "
"14769510","14770070"," Kind of."
"14775730","14786890"," Looks like it wants to, it looks like it wants to, it looks"
"14786890","14788450"," like next week it wants to go like that."
"14789150","14790250"," That's what it looks like to me. "
"14792170","14795350"," Into the 15th, that's what it looks like it wants to do, right in there."
"14808300","14827430"," I'm going to go with some"
"14830920","14837990"," kind of rejection up here, kind of a rejection to the spell right there, something like that."
"14840330","14842630"," It might even be lower somewhere in here. "
"14844790","14847650"," Why don't you tell me in the comments what you think is going to happen."
"14848450","14849950"," I think we're going to get another rejection."
"14854050","14855210"," That's what I think is going to happen. "
"14860560","14863000"," That's my take on today, rejection into the close."
"14866100","14867480"," We don't get it here."
"14868140","14871940"," If we trade sideways into the bell for Friday, we trade in like this sideways. "
"14872600","14874200"," I'm going to expect weakness into Monday."
"14876420","14880260"," If we catch this close, I might enter some trades for next week."
"14880480","14885520"," If we don't catch this trade into the close, I will wait to enter trades into Monday. "
"14887220","14888160"," That's my thesis."
"14889760","14891120"," That's what I think is going to happen."
"14893400","14895880"," I think that's the highest probability of happening. "
"14896720","14901740"," And then if you're bullish and say, oh, can we trade up cap to 400 or something, 3.98?"
"14902500","14910600"," Yeah, as puts lose their intrinsic value into this close."
"14911380","14912540"," Yeah, we can have the rapid and the close."
"14914480","14915800"," But it's been a down day already. "
"14916860","14920720"," It's the end of the week coming into Thanksgiving, start new on Monday."
"14921780","14923080"," I don't know, it's tough."
"14923720","14924580"," This is a tough day. "
"14924740","14930180"," Tough day to trade for next week."
"14931180","14937500"," If you want to know what my conviction is for the next two weeks, I think we're not done going"
"14937500","14937700"," up."
"14938500","14943800"," I think it's a matter of positioning long for at least middle of December. "
"14945900","14948760"," I don't think that you're not getting a holiday rally."
"14949200","14953560"," I think that it somewhat has to do with portfolio managers, friend of the year."
"14958930","14963050"," Yeah, I'm bullish into at least the 15th. "
"14964350","14967630"," So I guess you have to ask yourself, is this low enough, 393?"
"14970510","14973030"," For you to be long in the middle of the month."
"14973430","14979050"," If you're bearish, just put some time on your shit, if you're bearish."
"14980530","14984610"," Have the ability to absorb us going to 412. "
"14986710","14988890"," So put some time on your shit if you're bearish."
"14989950","14991590"," I would put it in the form of a spread."
"15004180","15006520"," We're going to hit Tom Lee's 440 call. "
"15008160","15014640"," Yeah, I think I'll check the data again, but they reset all the options heading into December."
"15015220","15017400"," I don't know what the implied move is."
"15017500","15019320"," I'll post that on Twitter, but I'll write that down. "
"15020220","15022280"," The implied move for December."
"15025190","15028130"," It got reset yesterday."
"15028610","15030470"," I think the implied move is like 400 to 380. "
"15031250","15033390"," That's that sideways trade we talked about earlier today."
"15034090","15040730"," For you buy a low and you just keep riding up or if you're a bear, you sell a top."
"15042910","15049010"," Every time we get around 412, 10, you can put your support on or put on a spread. "
"15051650","15053670"," But I don't think it's happening."
"15053910","15057090"," I don't think they're going to have a bloodbath."
"15058430","15065610"," The only thing that concerns me with the end of the after the 15th is the tax loss harvesting shit. "
"15066050","15067150"," You can only do that a few times."
"15067730","15071370"," So we got a lot of that out of the way already with the spec growth stuff."
"15072230","15078870"," Now that's already happened, but it wouldn't surprise me if we get weakness in the end of the year"
"15078870","15081810"," over the last couple of weeks unless retail takes over. "
"15081950","15082230"," That's true."
"15083110","15085210"," Retail will take over and run this motherfucker up."
"15086350","15091470"," If you're going to put on if you're bullish, you're going to put on some longs for a potential"
"15091470","15092130"," holiday rally. "
"15092370","15094010"," I do recommend a spread."
"15094510","15096410"," They're easier to maintain to manage."
"15098670","15100630"," There tends to be a slow grind up. "
"15100790","15106550"," If it is a holiday rally, it tends not to be like ass blasters to the moon rocket ship."
"15106830","15108150"," And when it does, it's a weird grind."
"15109070","15110350"," It's a weird bizarre grind. "
"15110550","15113670"," It's so much easier to just buy a spread and just let it let it print."
"15114870","15115930"," But I am bullish here."
"15116630","15120690"," If you guys want to know, if you guys are just joining me and you haven't been here all day"
"15120690","15125910"," long since they opened this morning, we are still in an up trend of bullish trend up. "
"15126410","15130050"," If you're bearish here and you're like, yeah, I want to get bearish here, you know, through your"
"15130050","15137210"," cap, you know, then again, you're still only taking it to right here."
"15138890","15139410"," Excuse me."
"15140190","15142370"," You can't get real bearish until this trend breaks. "
"15143710","15150930"," Like, like if you're going to put your uh 3200s on or your 3300 or JPM collars on, I wouldn't"
"15150930","15152670"," be putting them on until you're down here below."
"15153810","15158690"," Be aware on those JPM collars, they don't always print and there's three of them."
"15159090","15164190"," And they changed the price, the price targets on the second one. "
"15164390","15165790"," I don't know if they've done the third yet."
"15166110","15166850"," Maybe they did it today."
"15167310","15167670"," Third one. "
"15167990","15169090"," I don't know if third one's done yet."
"15169610","15171730"," But the second one, they changed their price targets."
"15171730","15175370"," And I meant to look yesterday to see where they're, what they're targeting. "
"15176730","15179610"," But they've got three different ones for three different arms of the bank."
"15179930","15183450"," So you're going to need to find out what that is."
"15183970","15185870"," So my take is I'm a bull, right?"
"15186110","15187770"," I want to see this down here. "
"15188130","15191350"," I would love to see a buy, be able to buy down here."
"15191570","15193510"," This is what I want to buy, that green, blue box."
"15194010","15196090"," I don't want to be buying 393. "
"15196910","15197850"," See what I'm saying here?"
"15198110","15198870"," Close it this."
"15199650","15207650"," I want to buy like a nice death clothes or I want to buy weakness over the weekend and then"
"15207650","15208190"," buy this."
"15208490","15209690"," Does that make sense for you guys?"
"15211150","15212410"," Like that's what I want to buy. "
"15213210","15214710"," You're a bull, that's what you want to buy."
"15215530","15216670"," You don't want to buy this shit up here."
"15216950","15219250"," Not for like a holiday rally trade. "
"15219810","15221610"," Holiday rally, you want to buy down here."
"15222370","15223390"," This is your zone."
"15224530","15227370"," This is where you can buy with comfort, right?"
"15227990","15229210"," Or a little bit more safety. "
"15229690","15230350"," Like buying this."
"15230990","15232430"," I don't know."
"15233130","15234410"," I don't want to buy this. "
"15235150","15240490"," So if you're a bull, patience here pays probably always a high probability of patience banger."
"15240770","15245990"," If you miss this trade and it starts to go up and you're like, I fucking hate you, that's fine."
"15246270","15249070"," You don't have to have every trade, every month, every year. "
"15251290","15257330"," I'd like to see some weakness into next week and get a chance to grab it."
"15257470","15260470"," And I think if I was a bank, I would want a good, if I was a bank and I'm"
"15260470","15263690"," like, I know it's going up, I would want to buy down here too."
"15264350","15265970"," And there's just some standing orders. "
"15266630","15268930"," If we go over to book map real quick, right?"
"15270530","15271010"," You can see."
"15272310","15273050"," Hold on a second."
"15282880","15285680"," I want you to look down where my cursor is down here, right?"
"15286480","15288120"," There's some standing orders down here. "
"15288780","15290820"," There are smarter people than you and I."
"15291000","15293780"," They're like, I'm going to get my 390 before we go up."
"15295180","15296540"," You see my cursor over there?"
"15298860","15301580"," And these are important to this 4000 is important."
"15301920","15304080"," This means these sellers, these sellers know we're going to 4000. "
"15304940","15309220"," And there's some buyers that know that."
"15311100","15317450"," There's some buyers down below at the 3900."
"15317570","15318670"," So patients does pay. "
"15319990","15329810"," And over the long term, patients does lend to patients does"
"15329810","15336130"," lend itself to you making better trades."
"15336770","15338530"," I don't know if I'm saying that correctly."
"15348220","15349960"," There's some bulls dumping for the clothes. "
"15350540","15353240"," It's an easy day for selling out PM SPX spreads."
"15353440","15353840"," Yes, it is."
"15356760","15360080"," Before you call it comes to do is I still have our SPX border P."
"15362320","15365160"," Last thing, Tom Lee hit was the head coming in 20 to do that. "
"15365340","15365940"," I appreciate it."
"15365980","15369500"," Really looks like you'll trade down with it by some Tesla calls Monday."
"15369500","15373380"," Yeah, I think I think to keep 400 P."
"15374740","15378140"," Yeah, I think I think we're going down. "
"15378440","15388180"," My take is that if you're already short, what makes me so sure that there will be a holiday rally?"
"15389100","15390540"," Yeah, history for number one."
"15393620","15397980"," The statistics say that this year we'll have a holiday rally."
"15402300","15405080"," The probability is that we'll have a holiday rally. "
"15405480","15407780"," We're not yet at top of resistance."
"15408980","15412480"," We're not at the actual everybody's going to sell yet."
"15412840","15414340"," We're not there quite yet, are we?"
"15414600","15415920"," I think it's at 410 right now. "
"15416520","15417460"," We're at 394."
"15417680","15425640"," So if I was going to take a short, I would wait until 410, like a meaningful short"
"15425640","15430580"," or meaningful spread or something."
"15430860","15432760"," I'd want to see us tag or touch 410. "
"15435620","15440080"," And then even then you don't need to take that short for the JPM caller until we break trend."
"15440520","15442540"," Again, what do you need?"
"15442800","15447200"," You need the 300 points or do you need the 375 points?"
"15447420","15448690"," That was bizarre to me."
"15449010","15451990"," Why would you would say, I need to have all of the move?"
"15452510","15454030"," You don't need all of the move. "
"15454350","15459710"," If you need all the move, I guarantee you that you will one day be broke and never be able"
"15459710","15460130"," to trade again."
"15460250","15467630"," I think you'll make yourself, you'll burn your accounts enough that you will at some point be a"
"15467630","15468090"," failed trader."
"15469470","15471070"," So you don't need the entire move. "
"15471870","15473830"," You need confirmation on the legs of the move."
"15474370","15479130"," And if you're getting a 300 point move, a 375 point move and you got 300 points of that move,"
"15479330","15481650"," why do you care?"
"15482950","15483710"," Why do you care?"
"15485170","15486470"," So you need us to break trend."
"15487230","15490430"," So if you're a bear, there's two things that haven't happened for you as a bear, right?"
"15491110","15494910"," Haven't hit major resistance yet, which is for fucking 10 right now. "
"15495410","15498630"," And you haven't broken the current trend that we're in."
"15498770","15503910"," So there's two major glaring issues for you as a bear."
"15506130","15512760"," Glaring, if you look at a year chart, there's a year chart of spy, right?"
"15514260","15515780"," We sold right here, right?"
"15516240","15516580"," We sold. "
"15517200","15518860"," Sold again right here, right?"
"15519980","15521520"," Sold again right here, right?"
"15522400","15526260"," And you're trying to tell me the fourth time that you picked it right here."
"15527620","15531720"," Maybe I can assure you that there's going to be a reaction here."
"15531860","15534960"," If we get here, even if we were to continue high, there's going to be a reaction here. "
"15535380","15536840"," This is the place right here."
"15537760","15538960"," Then the place all year."
"15540700","15543520"," So what are people looking for to sell right there?"
"15544540","15545400"," That's what they're looking to sell. "
"15548900","15553180"," Again, trend up trend up, right?"
"15554000","15554400"," This one failed."
"15555140","15556840"," But generally speaking, we get trend up."
"15559040","15565060"," So do we sell this now going to Christmas and Hanukkah and Kwanza and all that shit?"
"15565540","15565800"," Maybe. "
"15566980","15567980"," I don't think it's today."
"15568300","15573500"," I think that you're looking for, I think it's a bull you're looking for a dip by down here for"
"15573500","15574780"," end of the year, and then we sell it."
"15575460","15578460"," And I think that and sell it somewhere up where this resistance is. "
"15579600","15580720"," Remember that is that time."
"15582060","15585320"," I think you get your holiday rally."
"15586080","15590180"," And I think not just statistics, but portfolio managers, right?"
"15590720","15592200"," They've got these packets every month. "
"15592880","15596980"," Every quarter, they got to put them in if they're going to dump their positions, long-term"
"15596980","15597320"," positions."
"15598720","15600720"," And we're coming into the last quarter."
"15601780","15607320"," So they're hoping you would be shocked at how many portfolio managers are bullish. "
"15608460","15610060"," You should be bullish, generally speaking."
"15611420","15614300"," Most pros are bullish, believe it or not."
"15614740","15617340"," They might brag and say they want to, they're always shorting or whatever. "
"15617720","15618100"," That's not true."
"15618440","15622660"," Most portfolio fucking managers are long, not just long only but just long in general."
"15623060","15629360"," So they're trying to buy like a Clorox and hold it, trying to do spreads on static tickers like"
"15629360","15630080"," Amazon, right?"
"15631040","15632460"," Trades in a zone for fucking years. "
"15634780","15638040"," So they want consistency, they want consistency in profits."
"15640100","15641760"," Hedge funds blow up all the time."
"15642040","15647540"," So there is this back, there is this like thing in the background where you've got portfolio"
"15647540","15651220"," managers that are like, well, I'm hoping for that nice little close at the end of the year. "
"15651960","15653600"," Hey, look, the year sucked."
"15654840","15657480"," I shorted it down for you along the way."
"15657700","15658820"," So you've kept your money. "
"15659420","15668260"," But at the same time, look at that Dow Jones industrial average"
"15668260","15670080"," ended on a high note."
"15670540","15674260"," So I wouldn't personally fuck with that to the end of the year."
"15675960","15677720"," And if you're a bear, you want to see this trend break. "
"15679580","15683140"," So even if you were like, you know, cap your wrong, that's fine."
"15683380","15687680"," I still wouldn't take that trade down to 30, 30, 200 or 35 or 3,300."
"15687680","15689760"," I think it is until you broke this. "
"15690480","15696640"," I still wouldn't take that fucking trade until until you break this here."
"15696980","15698080"," This is where you want to take that trade."
"15699260","15706160"," As a matter of fact, that trade was was put on where trade was. "
"15706380","15712000"," That's just that that collar was put on right."
"15713000","15714240"," So where was that collar put on?"
"15715580","15718360"," It's put on on September 1st, right around there."
"15719640","15721900"," And that collar hasn't printed yet, right?"
"15722620","15723380"," So they need that. "
"15723800","15724880"," They put it back on."
"15725440","15728360"," Was it October 1st, right?"
"15728760","15731560"," No, it was like 921 or something."
"15732080","15735140"," But somewhere in here, forget the exact date, it was somewhere in here. "
"15736180","15740960"," And, you know, they were long in the collar and they want to go short in the collar."
"15742900","15749020"," They want to print the, they want to pay for the put on."
"15749700","15755680"," So anyways, I guess that point is, this could be the top right here, but I think we're going up"
"15755680","15755880"," there. "
"15756420","15757720"," I think at least over there."
"15757800","15762260"," If that means that we're going to trade this range right here, that means that we're going to trade"
"15762260","15764160"," this range into the middle of the month."
"15766680","15771320"," You can get fucked up in here as a bear or just put a lot of time on it. "
"15771600","15778560"," So you can actually beat this implied move because I think yesterday when I checked that the"
"15778560","15784100"," implied move was somewhere in here, 380 to 400 right in there, I should say."
"15786080","15792200"," This went, it wouldn't shock me to see us trade above and below this the rest of the month."
"15794680","15800220"," And then maybe a little bit of, you know, outside those, those, those bounds briefly. "
"15802700","15804200"," And then, then comes the role."
"15807200","15811180"," And then mark to be your bottom as is tradition."
"15819940","15822460"," Well, it's not certain, it's probably, yeah, it's all probability. "
"15827130","15830230"," Yeah, I'd like to see, I'd like to see that close."
"15830530","15832640"," I'd like to see the week close if I don't get the week close."
"15833000","15837440"," I'm still going to wait until Monday, Tuesday, I can wait for Monday, Tuesday, I can wait till"
"15837440","15838220"," December 1st. "
"15839100","15846180"," I want that fucking, I want that dip by, and to be confident, I'm not, I'm not confident in a"
"15846180","15846840"," dip by here."
"15848220","15851400"," I'm not feeling, I don't want the holiday rally from 393."
"15852200","15858000"," And I'm bull, you know, I'm not that petrol bull though, where I'm like, oh yeah, 393 fuck it,"
"15858020","15859160"," we're going to 440 today. "
"15867390","15876410"," Yeah, I'll have a, if you guys, how about this?"
"15876890","15879110"," If any guys are not signed up right now, right?"
"15880010","15890050"," Do me a favor, sign up for, go to captainjimjames.com and sign up, it's"
"15890050","15892570"," free, just sign up to captainjimjames.com."

"15900790","15901430"," February and March."
"15902550","15908450"," We guys will get a, the next, you get my predictions for the next four months."
"15910390","15914190"," Somewhere in there, I think I'll put up three or four months, and then every week I'll send out a"
"15914190","15914610"," new update. "
"15915570","15919370"," And we'll adjust if we need to as we go along for the coming weeks."
"15920250","15924310"," And every week we'll get a newsletter from me by I think by Sunday, I'll have one out for you"
"15924310","15924890"," every single week."

"15928490","15931470"," And it gives me a chance to put out a newsletter to you guys."
"15931950","15935570"," If I have any problems trying to get like mail to milk shim set up too quickly, what I'll do"
"15935570","15938810"," is I'll post the news, the first newsletter to your email."
"15939070","15943370"," If I don't, I'll post if I or if I have any kind of like just technical issues, I'll post"
"15943370","15945650"," it to at captain's alpha on Twitter. "
"15947430","15952370"," It's a private A L P H A."
"15952610","15954850"," So at captain's alpha, you can request friendship there."
"15955250","15956290"," And I'll let you in."
"15956690","15958250"," I just want to make sure you guys aren't bots. "
"15958430","15970430"," Many of you guys here are but sometimes bots try to try to get information from you and capture"
"15970430","15974170"," that and then correlate it all and then figure out what retail's doing."
"15974890","15979890"," You know, I'll have that out for you this weekend by Sunday."
"15979890","15987250"," You'll get the track that I think that we're going on from now into the next few months or so. "
"15992760","15999180"," Yeah, I mean, so the captain's trade challenge, I have some legal issues with doing that challenge."
"15999920","16001480"," I had been spoken to."
"16002100","16011980"," I was I was I was counseled to not run the challenge because it's"
"16011980","16016980"," what it is, is it's like a it's current in the line of legality for me. "
"16019120","16026600"," But the captain's challenge has worked consistently right up to this point, which is kind of cool."
"16027100","16029280"," Even in a downtrend, it's worked this entire year."
"16031340","16035720"," What I what I should do is at least do a maybe a video series on the captain's challenge and"
"16035720","16037260"," then say, you know, not financial advice. "
"16037260","16040280"," I can't tell you when, but it's fairly easy."
"16040640","16041420"," We'll go over that."
"16041960","16044840"," Let me write that down to captain's challenge. "
"16048250","16054030"," Maybe there's a way to do it legally where I'm not specifically saying today's the day."
"16054370","16058690"," That's the key is like if I'm the one saying to you, you should buy here, but I do it"
"16058690","16059190"," already."
"16060230","16061650"," I do it on Twitter. "
"16061830","16067430"," If you see me, I say to you, I have said a key points I've said, buy this fucking dip."
"16068450","16077790"," And that's because those indicators are saying that no matter what the market's saying, we're"
"16077790","16078750"," buying that fucking dip."
"16079070","16081970"," Like they're that don't give a fine fuck what you think's happening in the market. "
"16082790","16084390"," We're definitely going up here."
"16086870","16088210"," And it's worked all year long."
"16088790","16090750"," So yeah, we can go over that again. "
"16090850","16091750"," I can make a video on that."
"16093570","16095170"," I'll leave it for you guys alone."
"16095770","16097710"," You can have more confidence in when to take that trade. "
"16098310","16103010"," The key on that trade too is you really want to stay off social media when you're making that trade"
"16103430","16104310"," or those trades."
"16104850","16109850"," If you were to stay off social media and just get like an alert, but this is the time to"
"16109850","16111710"," buy and you place a trade and go back down to your bunker."
"16111970","16112830"," It pays every time. "
"16113410","16116130"," It pays every single time without fail."
"16117110","16119490"," It keeps me keeps me in the money."
"16122670","16125850"," Every it's like a 97% win rate. "
"16127370","16130390"," I think I think I've lost three times in that trade in a decade."
"16130870","16133470"," I like three times."
"16135450","16136610"," It's pretty fucking good. "
"16148110","16149590"," Yeah, good to see you too, stay huddled."
"16151350","16152890"," Inspired me to watch the market objectively."
"16153250","16154750"," I closed my over leverage quiz today. "
"16154850","16157970"," I bought earlier this week and playing day to day like one of the most."
"16158330","16160290"," Yeah, Captain Gran."
"16161210","16162290"," Yeah, I'll make that video. "
"16164690","16166670"," Yeah, I'm looking so on the PPO."
"16166670","16167710"," I'm looking for here."
"16167850","16170030"," Let me see if I can bring that and there's some other indicators too. "
"16170190","16172590"," So I got some more indicators for you guys to look at."
"16172590","16173570"," I'm not going to do it today."
"16173970","16176570"," I've got a bunch of shit that I'm going to roll out to you guys. "
"16179570","16181010"," So but I'll bring that up."
"16181210","16183210"," I'll bring that one up or those two up right now."
"16184490","16185270"," We can do it. "
"16185410","16186530"," I'll do it on SPX."
"16187670","16188490"," Yes, yes."
"16189310","16190050"," Hold on a second. "
"16193570","16195290"," Just do it one year by the day."
"16196230","16198310"," These indicators work regardless."
"16198630","16200030"," It doesn't matter if the market's going up. "
"16200150","16201650"," It doesn't matter if the market's going down."
"16203030","16210150"," There's the only thing that I would tell you on the market going up and going down is there tends"
"16210150","16219990"," to be there it tends to be more irrationality on the upside than the"
"16219990","16220690"," downside."
"16223390","16232650"," So if the market was going to go down, right, it tends to bounce off of predetermined levels. "
"16233210","16233730"," Does that make sense?"
"16234210","16239090"," So if we're going down, there are some firm levels that we tend to get a bounce in the trades"
"16239090","16239510"," over."
"16241330","16248570"," On the way up, we have a tendency to trade rationally."
"16249770","16252790"," So this trade works best long. "
"16256510","16258450"," You can get away with short time periods."
"16258910","16267310"," If you're going to take this trade as a put for a bear trade, sometimes I've lost trades."
"16267590","16269450"," I've lost on this trading. "
"16271290","16278410"," I've lost money on the bear side of this trade just because of how the market acts."
"16280210","16282370"," So here, I'll just put these two up."
"16283570","16286290"," Price percent to us later in the market breadth indicator. "
"16287710","16288710"," Just those two."
"16292010","16293190"," And let me see."
"16295770","16296690"," Bring those up. "
"16298030","16298830"," That's right here."
"16302730","16308370"," Okay, so this is the, this is a daily chart on the S&P 500."
"16313980","16317140"," And you don't have, I'll close this one. "
"16317860","16319200"," Okay, just this one right here."
"16319200","16319680"," Just one alone."
"16321520","16326140"," And you can see pretty fairly consistency when you should buy and sell this market on peaks and"
"16326140","16326400"," valleys. "
"16326820","16328400"," Now, there's some small places in here."
"16329140","16336140"," You can see like these small places in here where you, where you, you would have, like, like, so"
"16336140","16341240"," like right down here, right, Tuesday 30th of November, 2021, right?"
"16342420","16345380"," And we went up pretty high with them."
"16345460","16347080"," We made a much larger high over here. "
"16347080","16348300"," So you're going to miss some trades."
"16348800","16350340"," And some trades, you're going to have to hold longer than others."
"16350620","16355020"," But a month, three months on, you're generally going to make, you're going to, you're going to make"
"16355020","16356360"," your money, as a point. "
"16356920","16359640"," And if you're in a spread, you're going to have max gains anyways."
"16359980","16364920"," So even on this trade right here, you would have taken this trade and, and gotten out of it before"
"16364920","16366280"," we hit this, this red here."
"16366720","16372280"," But on these bottoms down here, whenever we're bottoming down here, these deep bottoms, deep, deep"
"16372280","16375860"," chasms, we tend to have a spike up, right?"
"16376860","16377840"," And see them right here. "
"16378200","16382040"," If we don't have that, that deep spike up, you can lose, you see that, right?"
"16383000","16384900"," So I do, we're in a downtrend right now."
"16384960","16386980"," So just using, just using basic."
"16391490","16398169"," So you just put a, we're in a downtrend right now, right?"
"16398509","16400490"," You know that you can buy somewhere down in here. "
"16400610","16401150"," It's going to print."
"16401590","16404250"," Now you don't need the stock market to go up."
"16404610","16412110"," You don't need the stock market to go, you know, on every trade to there. "
"16412110","16413990"," You don't need the stock market to go up there."
"16414110","16415810"," It just needs to go like right there."
"16416849","16418290"," No one needs to go right there. "
"16418330","16419830"," It doesn't need to make this giant trade."
"16420029","16424390"," And as a matter of fact, oftentimes in this trade, like you're, you're already at max gains right"
"16424390","16424590"," here."
"16424590","16425750"," So you get out of the trade. "
"16426210","16429390"," And then I've heard people say, well cap, I could have made all this money up here."
"16429430","16430390"," You kind of fucked me."
"16430650","16432509"," And I'm like, well, yeah, but it was consistent. "
"16433290","16437550"," You made 100% your trade here, you made 100% your trade here, 100% your trade here, you"
"16437550","16439790"," made 100% your trade here, 100% your trade here."
"16439910","16447610"," So, so my point to you is when you use this MBI, it tends to give you what you need"
"16447610","16449509"," to know to enter a trade."
"16449950","16456250"," And you can kind of see, and that matter of fact, this MBI trade actually worked back here too. "
"16456250","16460550"," Even in uptrend, we had the same liquidation of stocks, right?"
"16460689","16466410"," You can actually see liquidation of stocks all along the way."
"16467110","16468630"," And you can see there's another one right here."
"16469529","16472150"," You can see there's another one right here, right?"
"16473110","16476750"," You can see we have these mass liquidations, and we tend to trade higher. "
"16477570","16480550"," And it's weird is when you do a spread, it doesn't have to be like, you know, it's not like"
"16480550","16485950"," you're, it's like you're buying a spread at 370, and you need the spread to get 100% return."
"16486330","16488009"," It doesn't need to be like 400 or anything."
"16488630","16492330"," You can see 370 to 390, 50, that's a 250 point move. "
"16492730","16497470"," You don't need to go 250 puts points in a month and a half to make 100% return on"
"16497470","16500110"," any spread or any directional spread."
"16501110","16502630"," And that's the same thing down or up."
"16504189","16508970"," Anyways, the point to you is that this has worked all year long even this year, right?"
"16509150","16513730"," You could have just traded these troughs and you would have been just fine. "
"16514029","16514490"," Does that make sense?"
"16514990","16516029"," Enough time on the trade."
"16516230","16517050"," Let's see it came down here."
"16517430","16519110"," Next, this one probably would have been a failure in here. "
"16519930","16525070"," So we're going to fail a failure trade, but you still didn't hit bottom over here as well, which is"
"16525070","16529189"," one of the keys is that you're on this trend line hitting bottom."
"16529830","16533890"," As a matter of fact, let's say you only traded the beginning of the year, and you were trading just"
"16533890","16535509"," this trend line right here."
"16535990","16540790"," You would have only hit it three times, one, two, and three, but those three trades you would have"
"16540790","16542349"," been successful, right?"
"16542470","16545150"," You would have made 100% three times in a row this year. "
"16545669","16548349"," One, two, and three down here."
"16548610","16551550"," Now you would have missed this one down here, but you guys got me on Twitter."
"16551750","16555669"," I tell you when the bottoms are, and we did have that bottom down here. "
"16555750","16563110"," Matter of fact, I did alert and say by this exact that morning said by the dip, when CPI was"
"16563110","16566650"," being released, we dipped, and this was bought, all of this was bought right up."
"16568550","16573570"," So, and that had more to do with the active probability that we're going up."
"16574150","16575509"," There's too much time down here. "
"16578090","16580210"," But anyway, at any rate."
"16580650","16581130"," So that's the NBI."
"16581710","16588930"," If you add the PPO in price percent oscillator, sometimes these diverge. "
"16589270","16590550"," There's divergence in these."
"16591270","16594570"," An example would be right in here."
"16595270","16596450"," We were already peaking. "
"16596750","16597689"," I'm not going to put this up."
"16597890","16598610"," This is what I was telling to be."
"16598669","16599630"," We're not done going up yet. "
"16600990","16601990"," Right in here."
"16603230","16604130"," Move this over."
"16605029","16605650"," Right there. "
"16608900","16613820"," And before this all happened here, we were very, this is very bearish and negative, right?"
"16616300","16618200"," When we came up to this point right here, right?"
"16618419","16620619"," It's like, okay, sell wherever, wherever I am."
"16620759","16621520"," I'm in, which I did."
"16622400","16622419"," Right?"
"16623480","16630599"," And as we, as we started to trade down, you can see that there was a divergence here. "
"16631560","16633800"," If you look right where my cursor is right here, right?"
"16634660","16636360"," We had went from purple to green."
"16637060","16644000"," We began to roll over, and yet we stayed above on the PPO, the price percent oscillator, which"
"16644000","16648439"," meant that this market, not only was even though we were trading down, right, we were still"
"16648439","16653279"," actually going up on the PPO, which meant that this market hadn't been sold."
"16653419","16654720"," They weren't selling this market. "
"16655140","16655800"," Does it make sense?"
"16656380","16662180"," We had a divergence in the PPO and the, um, MBI."
"16663000","16668380"," And so under the hood, you might have thought to yourself, yeah, we're, we're going to fucking sell"
"16668380","16670160"," this straight down here."
"16670880","16673759"," But the PPO is telling you, no, no, no, no, we're not done. "
"16674860","16677220"," And the same thing is happening right here still."
"16679020","16682240"," You would be expecting right now to see a roll over here."
"16682640","16686720"," You're not seeing that roll over here, even though the price has not showed it yet. "
"16687840","16692419"," What you're seeing is this, we're positive now, right?"
"16692540","16693160"," We're not a negative."
"16693460","16700840"," We're in positive that the, that the bulls still have the benefit of the doubt."
"16702000","16707840"," And we have another example of us going higher previously, and we have a double bottom down here,"
"16707919","16708099"," right?"
"16708660","16710980"," Some kind of a double bottom we have going on over here, right?"
"16711119","16713980"," We didn't get quite get down to this trend line, did we?"
"16715779","16717259"," See that this is bullish. "
"16718560","16720480"," See that double bottom ish."
"16720619","16721400"," I mean, it's the lower low."
"16721640","16723140"," I think we're going lower too, eventually. "
"16723599","16729660"," But for the time being in this mid time, and not so much, these are bullish indicators."
"16729759","16734460"," These are telling you that under the hood, they're not quite ready to sell this market yet."
"16735140","16740320"," And you're seeing the MBI roll over, which means that it might, there might be one more push up"
"16740320","16741360"," coming up over here. "
"16742060","16751040"," If you look what makes up of the sectors that make up, that make up the MBI, they still have"
"16751040","16751380"," some room."
"16751560","16752680"," They're not at 100% yet."
"16753140","16754939"," They're down in the 80s and the 70s. "
"16755599","16758840"," So there, so can it roll over here?"
"16759040","16759200"," Yeah."
"16759860","16764380"," There are some indicators telling you that it's not quite done yet."
"16766259","16771320"," So in the short term, when the short term, I don't know what to say to you, and the short"
"16771320","16776460"," term I'm going to tell you that this market still has room to go up. "
"16777760","16779280"," We are in the holiday season."
"16781500","16788480"," If it was going to begin to roll over for that really death kill, I want to see some underlying"
"16788480","16791380"," under the hood selling of the stock market."
"16791540","16792460"," We haven't seen that yet. "
"16794740","16795920"," We haven't seen that at all."
"16806470","16808350"," Yeah, it's market, it's market breadth strategy."
"16808430","16813450"," And I've got other indicators for you to look at so you can compare all the divergences and all of"
"16813450","16819860"," them, all the divergences on all of them. "
"16820140","16828360"," So, so you guys can see why, why you buy that, why you bought this down here, why you bought"
"16828360","16832860"," this back here in the 13th of October, remember that what 9th of October was the 9th."
"16833440","16834580"," I don't remember what it was."
"16835140","16836560"," I can get my dates done yet back here. "
"16837860","16840960"," Why you bought this and didn't let it go down, right?"
"16841140","16843320"," The slam down and move this crank higher."
"16844720","16852900"," That's mostly a bunch of a bunch of PPOs, PPMs in the background telling you that nope, we're still"
"16852900","16856380"," going up or nope, sell this or nope, this is a bottom."
"16858120","16861360"," And so even though you got people screaming all over social media in the news saying I'm telling"
"16861360","16866620"," you the reasoning why the markets move, when it's moving, there's under the hood stuff that's"
"16866620","16868300"," telling you a different story. "
"16872910","16875750"," That's contradictory to what you're being told publicly."
"16880950","16884590"," I showed it just a few minutes ago what the end of the hood selling is, for what it looks"
"16884590","16884830"," like."
"16886430","16887590"," And I'll do a video one. "
"16887670","16889630"," I'm going to do a video series as you can see divergences."
"16890310","16895670"," And as a matter of fact, this last divergence that took place last month, you know, as you move"
"16895670","16899770"," forward and do these live streams again, I'll show them to you as they're happening so you can see"
"16899770","16908210"," the divergences and what they mean and why, you know, it's like, eh, I'm not quite there yet."
"16908650","16910250"," I'm going to be embarrassed to want to see certain things. "
"16912290","16919030"," I want to see like, I want to see something else telling me why we're being bearish here."
"16921590","16923870"," Let's go back to there's nothing going on."
"16923990","16925250"," They're probably going to try to park this thing. "
"16925730","16932310"," If I had to guess it's down or sideways into that clothes, man, maybe you get that."
"16932410","16932650"," Look at that."
"16932910","16933690"," That's just nasty. "
"16935110","16936310"," That is just wrong."
"16941980","16943360"," That is just filthy."
"16951080","16953740"," That's just nasty sideways, brutal. "
"16955380","16957160"," That is absolutely brutal."
"16957440","16961900"," But you want to see, I want to see, I guess bears want to see yesterday's same action, right?"
"16962220","16963260"," You want to see this right here?"
"16964220","16965620"," It's failure and then down."
"16966740","16968220"," I want to see that failure too. "
"16969460","16970460"," I want to see that failure."
"16983310","16988240"," Yeah, price percent oscillators."
"16988480","16994300"," You want to see, you want to see whenever you see the market get bought, right?"
"16995160","16997500"," Something conceptually for you to understand. "
"16998560","17004920"," There are sectors within the S&P 500 and let's say the market, we hit a market bottom, we go"
"17004920","17005460"," up, right?"
"17006140","17007740"," Not all sectors go up."
"17008840","17011680"," And so if the market's being bought, you will see a rotation."
"17012060","17017180"," You'll have people talk about rotations and it means that the money is rotating from sector to"
"17017180","17019100"," before they roll the market over. "
"17019640","17024420"," So if some sectors haven't yet been rotated into, sometimes it's a barrier."
"17024420","17026620"," You'll be like, oh, this shit should roll over today."
"17027000","17032520"," Then you see like, sometimes you'll see like the Dow Jones industrial average do great or you'll"
"17032520","17038480"," see small caps do great or you'll see tech do great, but not one at the same time. "
"17039020","17043800"," It's because the money is rotating between different sectors and then smaller sectors within even"
"17043800","17051780"," those, like S&P 500 you've got smaller, small sectors within the S&P 500 and they'll rotate in and"
"17051780","17054520"," out of those in that cycle of buying the market."
"17055040","17056680"," So when you're like, why isn't rolling over?"
"17056820","17059120"," Why do we keep going up slowly for the next two or three weeks?"
"17059720","17061140"," You know, why do we keep doing that?"
"17061300","17066520"," Why am I entering short positions so early and getting chewed up?"
"17066740","17071320"," And it's because they're rotating in and out of these sectors before they roll it all together."
"17077640","17081200"," Long dump trucks or long dump trucks and lot lizards. "
"17084610","17085790"," Yeah, Iceman ran."
"17086170","17086230"," Yep."
"17091210","17092710"," Yeah, I don't know what he's talking about. "
"17093250","17100290"," If you start to, if you start to add these indicators, two or three, four, and then you do them"
"17100290","17101470"," on longer time frames too."
"17101930","17108050"," They have different PPO oscillators and different time frames that are like on moving averages."
"17108610","17115350"," They do them on like a seven day, 20 day, 21 day, 50 day, 100 day, 200 day price percent"
"17115350","17115910"," oscillators. "
"17116450","17119370"," And you can look at, compare all three or four or five of them."
"17119890","17126010"," And it'll tell you exactly for a week now, if we're strong, lay down the road, how long they're"
"17126010","17130870"," holding these positions for if they're holding them for 30 days, 60 days, 120 days."
"17131330","17132970"," Advanced decline lines help with that too. "
"17133950","17134930"," We're going to get into that."
"17135090","17139190"," This new stream that I'm going to put up here, you're going to start seeing me showing you"
"17139190","17145330"," different oscillators, indicators, and they're going to tell you what's going on underneath the"
"17145330","17145490"," hood."
"17147270","17157310"," It's funny too, this morning, and I believe in Elliott Wave theory, but there's a lot of, it's"
"17157310","17163230"," funny, this one guy this morning said, he goes, well, if we don't break through, I think he said,"
"17163310","17170490"," if we don't break through 385 day, then the count is, he's the big word for it too, it's hilarious. "
"17170810","17175530"," I forgot what the word they used for, but he's like a five syllable word to say that it wouldn't"
"17175530","17175910"," work anymore."
"17175910","17182150"," And I was like, he's like, you know, I really like the Elliott Wave, but there's a proponent too"
"17182150","17184330"," that says it's exacting and it really isn't."
"17186110","17188490"," And then I deal with the people trade to it. "
"17189050","17190150"," So you have to respect that."
"17190590","17193330"," But still, the market doesn't abide by it."
"17194370","17197790"," Because then you get other traders are trade by moving averages, you got other traders are trade by"
"17197790","17208130"," level to level, you got put call ratios, you've got gamma, you've got events, actual"
"17208130","17214490"," news stories that do actually matter, some that are of course used for certain support and"
"17214490","17220670"," resistance is in the market, but you know, I don't have to say to you. "
"17221090","17227450"," You know, the guy asked us some guy last night was like, we're doomed and we're going down no"
"17227450","17227990"," matter what."
"17228750","17230090"," And I was like, yeah, we're going down."
"17230190","17231390"," But how do we get there though?"
"17232230","17236790"," Some small time retail trader that's going to just go, I'm fucking short today, we're going down. "
"17237450","17243370"," It's like, yeah, okay, so you're going down, we're going down, but can your position handle us"
"17243370","17244230"," going up to 410?"
"17245570","17249350"," Before we go down, can your position handle us going to 430?"
"17250410","17251050"," Or 440?"
"17251990","17253430"," Before we go down to 3,200?"
"17256130","17257090"," You know, can it?"
"17257490","17263890"," And if it can't, if you're not going to get a margin call, you know, if they're going to just"
"17263890","17269490"," allow you to be upside down by, you know, be upside down 30, 40, 50% in your position for"
"17269490","17273590"," six weeks or eight weeks or something, then that's a bad position, right?"
"17273990","17281070"," So I guess, I guess I point to you is they used to be careful of people telling you, I"
"17281070","17282790"," can tell you that we're going down 3,200."
"17283430","17283830"," Absolutely."
"17284190","17288270"," But when and how do I position, they never tell you where they're positioned to how they're"
"17288270","17288610"," positioned. "
"17289330","17291830"," They never tell you their ability to add to their positions."
"17292850","17297270"," Even I don't, do most of you guys know that Barrie was short for like years?"
"17298090","17301870"," Do you guys know that he didn't make that much money on the trade?"
"17303290","17307530"," And he's been wrong on many big trades over the years."
"17308490","17312150"," So it's not that I don't think that Barrie isn't hell smart, he is super smart. "
"17312730","17320710"," But as you and I, as the guy on the street, to try to compare ourselves to his trades, you"
"17320710","17331130"," just, you're not on the same, not ability level, same resource level to be in that trade, you"
"17331130","17332350"," know, where you're eventually right."
"17333570","17334730"," That's a hard thing to be."
"17335010","17339970"," It's a, you know, it's a hard, you have to be backed by some serious money. "
"17341490","17342310"," That's long and short."
"17343870","17348530"," You know, you can, you can add to a trade that's long and eventually we'll print for you something."
"17349450","17352510"," And if you keep adding to that trade, right, put enough time on it, it will. "
"17353690","17356150"," So if you run off, you know, get what I'm saying."
"17356870","17360170"," Ah, shit, sexy, sexy, hot, fun girls."
"17362150","17363110"," Let me see here. "
"17363650","17364990"," How do I delete these hot, fun girls?"
"17371510","17375190"," I can't seem to delete sexy, but that's the reason I'm my end, I can't."
"17376150","17377030"," A lot of wizards."

"20184030","20185570"," So let me give an example. "
"20185990","20192070"," So Uh Let's say you buy a call here for 10 cents, right?"
"20192850","20195390"," And let's say it goes for 30 cents here, right?"
"20196290","20202370"," It'll reset itself down here At so let's say it was down here was at 10 cents into the end"
"20202370","20207390"," of the day right 10 cents It'll reset itself at five cents and then go to 15 cents."
"20207630","20213490"," Let's say to here Okay, so you have to it's a directional move If you wanted to trade this and"
"20213490","20219650"," let runners run you have to be buying like one two three date calls Fuck yeah, look at that move"
"20221070","20226790"," Not always but uh These trades are directional you take them for the direction you take your money"
"20226790","20236350"," and you run 396 is now up to 43 cents Almost another 100 percent trade Look at"

"20256230","20264450"," cents and now they're up to 44 cents I got a part I got a part of it I'm happy"
"20264450","20270190"," like I'm pissy at myself right now because I'm catching just a bit of this move and not the full"
"20270190","20276350"," potential Day they are directional moves."
