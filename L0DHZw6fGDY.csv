"1465960","1473440"," get up there and tag that that JPM caller it should then act as some kind of repelling like buffer"
"1474300","1484300"," to the upside we should get a roll into next week with volatility based on CPI uh JPOWL that"

"1586370","1594110"," so should be a rip there should be like so on Wednesdays did you guys hear all that I said"
"1594110","1601010"," about Wednesdays so you get day one day two of this week right consolidation pin went to Monday"
"1601010","1606830"," Tuesday if no significant downward move I'll go over to get I don't know if you guys heard me say"
"1606830","1621480"," this maybe it was muted say"
"1621480","1629600"," one more time so just taking a quick note uh of what Wells Fargo's has to comment so they forecast"
"1629600","1634640"," no change with the rate to remain at four spot five percent so they say the bank of Canada is"
"1634640","1639600"," to hold its June and monetary policy meeting next week and in our view the central bank will opt to"
"1639600","1644980"," keep rates on hold at four spot five percent for the third meeting in a row in line with consensus"
"1644980","1651980"," expectations so inflation dynamics in Canada mute that for a minute say yeah you got Canada you're"
"1651980","1656780"," looking at I think it's Canada Australia for a pause and rates go go quote me on those countries"
"1656780","1669760"," that's what I think it is you get the initial push up right thrust up turns into consolidation you"
"1669760","1680940"," become range bound right Monday Tuesday no significant push down on Monday right failure"
"1680940","1689100"," to get new lows on Tuesday this is the big one right here when you get failures on Monday failures"
"1689100","1696120"," on Tuesday this is the last day for bears right the wet Wednesday right and if they'd had failures"
"1696120","1706010"," back here you see what happens when you fail to get new lows right you fail"
"1706010","1711150"," to get a new low on Monday other than the consolidation you have the failure to get it on Tuesday"
"1711150","1717730"," and then late in the day on Thursday or on Tuesday you get a higher low here what happens you"
"1717730","1722890"," squeeze higher you confirm the check down below and then you come back to the scene of the crime"
"1722890","1731970"," above here to wipe that out if the move is not lower if you're not going to get a cheap"
"1731970","1738730"," price for a rip higher the move is going to be higher now this is still not a strong push"
"1739730","1747210"," that is the one thing to be clear on right this move to the top of consolidation is still not"
"1747210","1755910"," strong whatever this last move is if we go up here and tag the JPM caller it's likely not going"
"1755910","1763810"," to hold the good part is that when you haven't seen significant downside movement on Monday on"
"1763810","1771410"," Tuesday we tend to trend earlier in the week we'll have it up Wednesday we normally have call"
"1771410","1776750"," buying on Wednesday in the middle of the morning you're seeing it right off the bell you should see"
"1776750","1786430"," Thursday also be a trend day with us sell the news into Friday and this leads into next week's"
"1786430","1801840"," volatility we know the JPM caller is above at 4326 I believe on SBX when"
"1801840","1807840"," we hit that caller target we normally break it they don't normally like tag it and roll we normally"
"1807840","1827940"," break above it and hold and consolidate and roll from there now"
"1827940","1837380"," let's look above we have 436 76 438 441"
"1837380","1855840"," 443 these are all targets to the upside we know that right now there's"

"2954040","2961180"," going lower You have to switch to south side Makes sense When you're in this zone right here You're"
"2961180","2970420"," buying and selling rips You do not hold long Above this box You wait until we break above the box"
"2971120","2981080"," And then you take the next level higher You have zones like zone here, zone here Same thing"

"3055370","3059390"," You can get a meaningful low And they couldn't right?"
"3059710","3064870"," The moment that they couldn't get that meaningful low yesterday It pointed to the upside right?"
"3065070","3075030"," But even such This is still your range You're still range bound I want to prove a point to you"
"3075030","3084600"," right now If you're losing money right now I want to talk to you specifically"
"3084600","3100140"," Because This gets better So"

"3106040","3116920"," 11.54pm yesterday I said nothing has changed Trade the range Chasing"
"3116920","3125160"," crumbs Pick up long above with a successful retest Sell a break in rejection below Be warned, move"
"3125160","3130880"," higher as weak And will likely result in a decent pullback For the actual move higher in early July"
"3131980","3140920"," So let's look at this post that I made And this post is Trade the range right?"
"3141280","3147380"," Buy it, sell it, buy it, sell it Buy it, sell it We're right here right by the way right?"
"3148060","3158060"," And you sell it Now Inside of this range right here You need to have seen The peak ahead Above"
"3158060","3158440"," right?"
"3158640","3168640"," This is like the whale coming above Ooooh And consolidates One two Then we get the"
"3168640","3171620"," next range above Closing the gaps up here right?"
"3173560","3178060"," Yesterday Picked below We didn't reject though, did we?"
"3178200","3185200"," We just peaked below, that was it We didn't get below the range And start to reject to the"
"3185200","3186220"," downside, did we?"
"3186880","3189200"," So we can trade this down here right?"
"3189560","3193260"," We can trade this up here Until that happens, what is this called?"

"3225910","3228010"," This is no man's land in here right?"
"3229210","3233410"," So like you're like Ooooh I'm gonna buy this dip, woohoo Right that's great, I think that's great"
"3234650","3244510"," You take the money and run If the algos push you up here Guess what you can do here You"

"3252170","3254490"," is where you enter Does that make sense?"
"3255590","3263970"," And you trade this right here for more money Now with that said There are better setups than other"
"3263970","3272470"," setups So you get some great setups Some of these aren't so good Like this one here for the future"
"3272470","3278970"," for the rest of this week If we get up there It's not the best setup It's a good setup"

"4573180","4574800"," Check the one minute chart out."
"4575720","4577660"," Catch it a nice bounce right here."
"4580120","4586260"," There's looking for rejection here at 42790 for further downside. "
"4586880","4589320"," We still have a gap to close down below at the pivot."
"4590600","4596660"," We also have another jump in point above at 42830."
"4608740","4616560"," Oh man, look at that move right there. "
"4616700","4618420"," That's a great inter-day move, isn't it?"
"4618580","4620260"," Up and straight down."
"4623680","4625500"," Tag the seat of the crime almost perfect."
"4630320","4636440"," For whatever reason, we're not showing the, I don't know why, but the five minute is not showing up"
"4636440","4636680"," here. "
"4637920","4639240"," Oh yeah, baby."
"4642850","4651610"," Here's where the, we bring this five minute over."
"4674700","4676040"," Somewhere down here, right?"
"4676260","4676820"," Is that where it is?"
"4679020","4687500"," 42780 is where the 42780, this is the hourly trigger. "
"4696340","4698260"," This is a one minute chart right now."
"4708940","4711600"," Yeah, I want to see the targets for me."
"4711740","4712680"," I'll show them to you right now. "
"4715760","4718740"," We've been buying the hourly, so I want you to be aware of that."
"4718740","4721040"," We are buying the, so this is the hourly trigger right here."
"4721120","4722720"," We've been buying this like crazy down here. "
"4728280","4730220"," Oh, the two targets to the downside."
"4737790","4739370"," Two targets to the downside."
"4740450","4741870"," And these are weak bulls. "
"4742210","4743850"," Like all these bulls up here are weak."
"4743990","4745330"," I want you to know that we talked about that earlier."
"4746390","4746670"," They're weak. "
"4747170","4748030"," They're not strong."
"4748550","4751490"," They don't have the power of a dip."
"4752250","4754010"," So I'm going to give you two targets down below. "
"4754010","4756630"," The first one is 42538."
"4758690","4762010"," Next one is 41782."
"4764730","4768430"," So you've got a 42536. "
"4770550","4787410"," To the"
"4787410","4789970"," downside right about here."
"4790930","4791610"," PT1."
"4803110","4804150"," Right down in here. "
"4812060","4814660"," To the really far down side."
"4817100","4820500"," I don't think we get this one, but I'm a cheap fucking bullman."
"4821120","4823680"," It's a 417 in some change. "
"4826380","4827640"," Way down here."
"4848990","4852770"," They don't normally get straight down here, so we'll leave it a little bit higher."
"4853690","4854890"," It's somewhere down in here. "
"4856530","4857270"," And there's S3."
"4857650","4860330"," Probably get down to S3 down there."
"4870200","4874400"," Also remember that back here we've got demand here and here. "
"4874680","4875620"," That's S1."
"4876260","4877420"," Be aware of this."
"4899860","4902520"," Also remember that middle end of the day. "
"4902740","4903620"," Well, it's two things today."
"4903740","4904540"," We talked about this earlier."
"4905300","4912080"," We have the market pin between 426 and 428 on the day. "
"4915000","4924620"," And we also have call buyers that step in between 1130 and 1230 on Wednesdays"
"4924620","4926400"," for Friday rip."
"4927840","4935480"," So we'll keep an eye on call"
"4935480","4940040"," buyers for Friday down here."
"4992700","4995320"," Yeah, I still have puts for Friday. "
"4995820","4996700"," I haven't sold them."
"5019380","5020260"," I haven't sold."
"5020420","5023360"," If you guys want to exit your puts, you can, right?"
"5023680","5024820"," Even if you're down a few..."
"5024820","5025280"," I want you guys..."
"5025280","5026480"," Some of you guys probably don't realize this. "
"5027460","5029380"," If you exit your puts, right?"
"5030140","5031380"," You haven't lost any money."
"5032620","5035240"," So let's say you exit your puts at 14 cents, right?"
"5035680","5038700"," You're going to realize all the gains on your call side."
"5038840","5039420"," Do you realize that?"
"5039900","5041280"," You guys understand that concept?"
"5042380","5046080"," You're going to realize all the call side gains the moment you close those. "
"5046900","5049420"," Like you don't need to win both sides."
"5050420","5055220"," If you win one side of the trade, the other side's going to make it look like you're losing money,"
"5055280","5057000"," but if you close them, you're going to be winning money."
"5057120","5057560"," Does that make sense?"
"5059720","5061440"," So you can close here if you want. "
"5063060","5065280"," Then you'll still be up in a winning trade right now."
"5071370","5072810"," So for me, I look at it."
"5072950","5075950"," For me, how I look at this for myself is I have free puts. "
"5076450","5079450"," At this point, I have free puts until Friday."
"5079670","5080530"," I've paid for these things."
"5081270","5082090"," It costs me nothing. "
"5084690","5085830"," Yeah, I'm watching the..."
"5085830","5087290"," I'm watching the..."
"5088090","5090070"," I'm watching the VIX over here in the background."
"5092010","5092910"," VIX trying to..."
"5092910","5094150"," VIX trying to trade..."
"5095150","5097090"," 14-42 right now if it can."
"5124900","5127140"," Maybe you guys haven't traded strangles before. "
"5127440","5129160"," I want you to know that if you take..."
"5129160","5131560"," Let's say you take the 14 cents on the puts."
"5132820","5135120"," It makes your call side look better."
"5135460","5136460"," Do you guys understand that?"
"5136780","5137900"," I don't know if I'm reporting that correctly. "
"5139640","5140920"," Even if you're losing..."
"5140920","5142880"," Let's say you lost two pennies on your puts."
"5144280","5146240"," Or even five pennies on your puts."
"5146980","5155080"," If you made 10 or 12 or 13 pennies on the other side of that trade, you're not losing that"
"5155080","5157080"," 15 cents or whatever it is for you. "
"5160400","5162780"," Yeah, no, I'm not on the buy trade here."
"5162840","5163840"," I'm on the downside trade."
"5166680","5168500"," I see it fx for you trades for two. "
"5171400","5173000"," No, I'm not buying it."
"5173000","5174160"," I'm not buying it."
"5174260","5177980"," Mm-hmm. "
"5178620","5180740"," I'm diamond-handing my puts, baby."
"5184420","5185380"," Diamond-handing."
"5188780","5189840"," He's bears, man. "
"5190060","5190620"," Look at these bears."
"5190960","5191700"," Relentless bears."
"5202930","5205510"," If we could get at least this 425, was it?"
"5205590","5206470"," 425-22?"
"5207230","5209210"," If we could get this down here, he'd be happy. "
"5209690","5210730"," I'll take this right here."
"5212450","5214150"," If we could get this right here, I'll be happy."
"5215230","5221290"," I would love that if we could just go like reject and then down here, and then we actually get"
"5221290","5223330"," dip-eye for Friday down here. "
"5223490","5224090"," I'll take that."
"5226270","5233050"," If we reverse, I want you to see the larger bear plane here."
"5233150","5233610"," It's right here. "
"5235630","5237530"," This is the bear plane right here."
"5239830","5246750"," If it reverses and we come above and we successfully retest for the move higher, I'll buy calls"
"5246750","5247310"," right there."
"5248090","5249070"," That's where I'll buy calls. "
"5249430","5254070"," I'll close out my puts for Friday or maybe even just leave them on and just keep buying calls and"
"5254070","5256610"," leave those on as a hedge protection into Friday."
"5260630","5262550"," I like leaving that shit on, man."
"5262790","5264770"," What I do is strangle or straddle. "
"5265550","5269810"," Sometimes if we get to have two wild swings, I'll close both sides out."
"5270770","5277610"," If I get the one side that prints, if the one side prints the up and down side, I'll realize"
"5277610","5283750"," profit from the one side and I'll just leave the other side on as protection, as a free trade."
"5290840","5294080"," Now, this has to do with a strangle, like what you do with a strangle. "
"5303900","5304480"," You'll see."
"5305000","5307460"," I'll show you how to win both sides of a strangle right now."
"5307580","5308100"," I think I will. "
"5308340","5311100"," I think I'm going to show you how to make money on both sides of a trade today."
"5311940","5314060"," I'm almost positive I'm going to show you how to win both sides."
"5318670","5325430"," In real time, not somebody making a video on YouTube recording it and telling you someone actually"
"5325430","5326010"," trading it. "
"5329310","5329990"," Ooh."
"5331370","5332730"," 420 P's."
"5334430","5335790"," 420 P's. "
"5336690","5337950"," What's up, 420 P?"
"5338710","5340070"," What up, doggy?"
"5343190","5343870"," Ooh."
"5346250","5346930"," Ooh."
"5347070","5349190"," I'm going to show you green on both sides of a trade here. "
"5352930","5354450"," Ooh, yeah."
"5356630","5357710"," Ooh."
"5363810","5364350"," Ooh. "
"5369710","5370250"," Ooh."
"5378280","5379720"," Ooh, yeah."
"5381520","5386040"," All those state-again people are like, oh shit, we're trading the bottom in the top of the range. "
"5386900","5388660"," They're like, we don't want to go above and about."
"5388840","5392880"," We want all these putting call sellers."
"5393140","5394040"," They're like, wait a minute. "
"5395340","5397360"," They're like, this is the bottom of the range cap."
"5398480","5403020"," I don't want to close my, I want to close my spreads, bro, until three to four PM today."
"5405400","5411360"," It's like, theta gang is like, theta gang is like, you can trade this, you can trade that, you can"
"5411360","5413380"," trade this, you can trade that, but you cannot. "
"5414280","5417720"," This is like, theta gang is like, do not trade down here."
"5418860","5420380"," Until Thursday and Friday."
"5423980","5426760"," They're like, do not trade this above. "
"5429140","5430600"," Until Thursday, Friday."
"5438870","5440350"," There's your range right there."
"5440470","5441050"," We're still in it. "
"5442550","5444730"," Or a low, higher low."
"5445110","5447310"," And here's your last chance to buy a dip right here."
"5448490","5449070"," This is it. "
"5453740","5456340"," Let me write these in here for you so you can see them better."
"5459950","5461190"," You can see this here."
"5461950","5463030"," This is where the sellers were. "
"5463670","5470310"," We broke through the sellers, came back down, got a nice tie, come back down to retest it again."
"5471470","5472670"," I want you to see this here."
"5472670","5474410"," This is the previous low from yesterday. "
"5475570","5476650"," Keep track of it."
"5491080","5502320"," And this is the early low,"
"5502440","5502660"," I guess."
"5511040","5513540"," This is where you want to see demand come in right here. "
"5514240","5516440"," See, see how it came up here, right?"
"5516900","5518200"," Blasted above, came back down."
"5518340","5519260"," This is where your buyers were."
"5520300","5524600"," So your original buyers were down here, and they're trying to step back in right now. "
"5525600","5528040"," See if these buyers are real or not."
"5544120","5546440"," Let me know if you think that they're real or not."
"5562290","5565810"," We have a one minute cross on the hourly trigger right now. "

"5598940","5602380"," target on VIX $14.42. More down, likely to come."
"5641630","5646430"," Yeah, VIX has a bull playing right now in the one minute chart. "
"5646670","5650150"," It's trying to trade $14.42 right here, so we'll see."
"5651730","5653570"," See if the VIX can do it here."
"5669160","5670680"," No, we have not hit it yet. "
"5671460","5672540"," We have not hit it yet."
"5674260","5676400"," Like that kick-ass dip buy."
"5676660","5681520"," It doesn't come every day, but when it comes, you fucking buy it every time. "
"5681860","5682760"," I buy it every time."
"5685020","5687040"," It works every single fucking time."
"5687780","5688580"," It never doesn't. "
"5690900","5692360"," We'll make these moves higher."
"5692700","5693440"," They just aren't sustainable."
"5694940","5696040"," We'll get the JPA. "
"5697180","5698880"," We'll get the JPM caller."
"5699200","5702260"," It's just not something that's going to be there."
"5702260","5704800"," The bigger move is in July, definitely. "

"6552040","6553620"," Yesterday's chat was out of control. "
"6556880","6558580"," It was out of control, brother."

"6562220","6563980"," It was absolutely wild. "
"6569740","6572120"," You saw the 951 Green Kennel on V today."
"6572320","6575640"," I just knew, knew that I could use that as a great entry for puts."
"6576400","6578940"," I hesitated and missed out, going to relax. "
"6579060","6580240"," Let me take a look at V before your brother."
"6581640","6582540"," Let me take a look, brother."
"6584740","6585540"," I think tight, man. "
"6590010","6590990"," Kind of having some."
"6591350","6592730"," I don't like seeing this right here."
"6595170","6596550"," It's starting to look like consolidation. "
"6596970","6599130"," We'll see if we can get more downside or not."
"6602310","6603470"," Let's take a look at V."
"6603470","6609210"," Oh, yeah, that's a nice trade, man."
"6610930","6612730"," That is a nice trade. "
"6617860","6619220"," That's a really nice trade."
"6620220","6626080"," Let me look at this one closer."
"6630510","6632170"," Dip by, dip by, dip by. "
"6632910","6638310"," I would not enter puts here on V."
"6640170","6641470"," It's possible that you can."
"6641690","6642810"," Let me look closer at it."
"6643050","6644370"," Give me a second here and I'll look at it closer. "
"6655320","6656300"," I think tight, brother."
"6657640","6659620"," I got to look at it on a couple different charts."
"6663580","6665100"," Consolidation for spy right now. "
"6684020","6691260"," So, according to an Indian oil official, OPEC plus wants to push oil prices to $80 a barrel."
"6691260","6693120"," So, it's coming from an Indian oil official."
"6700790","6702470"," It's a real tough one, brother. "
"6705110","6708670"," The dip has been being bought down here."
"6709470","6713910"," You broke below the weekly and the weekly is here."
"6714930","6715690"," We'll look at it together. "
"6719430","6720330"," Hang tight, man."
"6720410","6721110"," We'll look at it right now."
"6726700","6729340"," It's a tough trade from here for you. "
"6730200","6732280"," Is there more down to go likely?"
"6733480","6735480"," But the entry kind of sucks."
"6741470","6751640"," So, Zach, this is a longer term forecast for Visa, okay?"
"6765110","6768790"," So, the short on Visa was right here."
"6771870","6773610"," I'll see if I can do this for you, man. "
"6776390","6777670"," Somewhere right in here."
"6779590","6781110"," There's another big one right here."
"6783210","6784090"," Somewhere in here. "
"6786630","6787990"," There's another one right here."
"6792320","6793860"," Just long term, right?"
"6794480","6796240"," This is February of 2023."
"6796540","6797700"," This is April. "
"6798440","6803460"," And then this is May 22nd."
"6805860","6809700"," But as we get down here, it starts to get a little crispy."
"6811620","6813560"," On a longer time period. "
"6816160","6818080"," You see the demand here, right?"
"6819340","6820420"," Demand demand."
"6821220","6823840"," It's likely going to step back in somewhere down here."
"6824740","6827140"," The thing about Visa, man, that's a problem for you. "
"6827620","6833460"," Not a problem, but the thing about Visa, brother, is old fat white guy sitting at a desk for 20"
"6833460","6833720"," years."
"6833840","6834260"," Trade this."
"6834620","6838880"," Trade it down, trade it up, trade it down, trade it up, trade it down. "
"6843460","6845400"," On a larger time frame."
"6847640","6851780"," Canada's finance minister says there's no country in the world better positioned for a softer"
"6851780","6852820"," landing than Canada."
"6870640","6872120"," Let me put this on a better chart. "
"6874160","6875080"," It's bearish."
"6875900","6877180"," There's two things I'll tell you here."
"6878100","6879080"," It's bearish here. "
"6881520","6883560"," The five minutes coming down to help you."
"6883700","6885620"," You've got a cluster with this weekly."
"6886180","6890280"," The only issue I have here is this weekly here is very emotional. "
"6891020","6893040"," So we attract to it."
"6893300","6898700"," So my point here is if you have a bloodbath down here, be prepared for an immediate rip higher back"
"6898700","6899120"," to it."
"6900880","6901860"," Hold on here. "
"6902720","6903580"," 30 minute chart."
"6906560","6908400"," One minute chart for Visa."
"6936590","6946590"," If you want more down on it, brother, if you want to enter short on Visa, I"
"6946590","6949050"," mean, you're good right where we are right now. "
"6949150","6956570"," As long as we stay underneath the 221 81, but the truth is, 222 93 is your next short on"
"6956570","6956690"," it."
"6956830","6960890"," If you like want to short it again, there's two places to short it right here."
"6961190","6961450"," 223. "
"6962950","6965370"," And then again above here at 227."
"6966250","6967550"," This is the better trade up here."
"6967690","6968850"," 227, believe it or not. "
"6969390","6973110"," They close the scene of the crime and then we continue lower."
"6973110","6978190"," So be careful of that return of the scene of the crime to get lower on Visa."
"6978970","6981930"," So like you got this one here, lower, to make sense. "
"6984430","6990380"," So you've got a, you got another one right here."
"6993960","7004160"," So 223, like right"
"7004160","7005800"," in there and then right up here."
"7008860","7010260"," Here's your big one right there. "
"7010400","7013700"," 226, 227, like a failure, like."
"7014160","7016640"," And then back down again."
"7017180","7018800"," That's where you get your new lows down here. "
"7025460","7028400"," But I do want you to see the zigzag channel."
"7031540","7033460"," That's where the buy is right down here."
"7034500","7035220"," Down here. "
"7036020","7037820"," Any of this stuff happens here."
"7038540","7042440"," If you break above this right here, your short is over."
"7043320","7049260"," If that 227 is kind of like, you're not kind of, but here's your get the fuck out of town. "
"7050740","7053580"," Did you not want to get caught in this stops above right here?"
"7058360","7059580"," You get caught in that?"
"7061940","7063500"," You're going to get your face ripped off."
"7063800","7065040"," Or you have to at least have to take long there."
"7065040","7069700"," And you can see it down here, right?"
"7069900","7073200"," You've got more down to go, but not much more. "
"7078600","7086160"," It's possible downside target 215.85. 215 somewhere in there."
"7086760","7088300"," Target right there."
"7089360","7089920"," 218. "
"7093600","7095180"," 218 maybe."
"7096440","7099200"," Or you buy the dip here and you buy it again at 218."
"7105160","7107520"," I'm assuming that you're looking for this one down here. "
"7107680","7109240"," You already had the bigger move yet."
"7109400","7110560"," But one big move there."
"7111200","7112800"," Higher or lower right here in the monthly. "
"7113300","7113940"," It's bullish, bro."
"7114100","7114740"," It's not bearish."
"7116260","7116880"," It's bullish. "
"7122440","7123820"," It's old white guy trading, man."
"7124640","7125380"," Not a bad trade."
"7125900","7126700"," That's what it is. "
"7140000","7141200"," Yeah, Zach, I agree."
"7141360","7147640"," You can jump in him and not look at him for a week or two or some."
"7163640","7167880"," The more time that we spend here, I do want you to realize that the more time that we spend"
"7167880","7171840"," here, the more bullish it becomes, becomes less bearish. "
"7173160","7178400"," The more time that we hang out here, the more I want you to see something here."
"7178400","7182120"," So when you have a vertical line coming down, right?"
"7187530","7189270"," See this yellow line right here?"
"7192730","7194410"," The yellow line is vertical."
"7195330","7201510"," If that yellow line starts to trade sideways, it's going to imply a move higher. "
"7201650","7202770"," I want you to see that here, okay?"
"7204830","7207330"," So the bears don't have a lot of time left."
"7207550","7210310"," They've got seven minutes to get a new low."
"7210310","7215650"," If they don't get this new low right here, we're going to hand it back over to the bulls and"
"7215650","7216930"," they're going to take this for a ride. "
"7220190","7222530"," They're going to pay attention to this the next five minutes."
"7230500","7233820"," Bears need a new low next six minutes."
"7233820","7234680"," They've got six minutes. "
"7236640","7241140"," Bears, then this is your previous low right here, 427.03. Bears have to get it."
"7242000","7242600"," They don't have a choice."
"7248120","7252920"," If they do not get the new low in the next six minutes, it is no bueno for sellers. "
"7255400","7257700"," They will hand the next hour over to the bulls."
"7279340","7280360"," Can I look at Tesla?"
"7280680","7281300"," Yeah, I can look at Tesla."
"7281300","7288260"," Tesla, baby. "
"7316640","7324260"," Okay, so on Tesla."
"7325380","7339910"," You know Tesla's"
"7339910","7341190"," in strength right now, right?"
"7345600","7346240"," 62."
"7346960","7349900"," Tesla can go to Tesla's close to a top. "
"7351220","7357060"," But even so being in a top, it's not necessarily a bad thing."
"7359220","7360500"," So here."
"7364000","7366540"," Maybe we can make this a white with a dotted. "
"7367780","7370180"," Make that a dash line, maybe."
"7370840","7372340"," Okay, so Tesla."
"7375920","7378740"," The key part about Tesla here is. "
"7380000","7381080"," Move that out of the way."
"7382080","7383300"," Key part about Tesla."
"7383600","7384360"," Let me show it to you this way. "
"7395920","7398040"," Oh, look at that by Tesla, baby."
"7398700","7399680"," Look at that by Tesla."
"7400620","7402640"," Alert right there by Tesla. "
"7403420","7404300"," Woo hoo."
"7405780","7410100"," Yeah, I want to buy the sell the alert."
"7410320","7410540"," Look at that. "
"7410640","7411960"," It's almost a perfect fucking tick."
"7415620","7418200"," So in this channel to the upside on Tesla."
"7419360","7420820"," We'll wait to see this right here, right?"
"7422360","7425140"," Sorry, hold on. "
"7426760","7428780"," You're getting to the extreme, right?"
"7429180","7429580"," In the channel."
"7429580","7433260"," We saw the sellers come in here this morning, right?"
"7433920","7436240"," See Tesla getting a dip by up here."
"7436580","7438620"," Not anti-blasting above the channel. "
"7440040","7441760"," The straight vertical barring it up."
"7442280","7450460"," This has more to do with this trade higher will have more to do with the JPM caller trade or"
"7450460","7453000"," the sentiment trade to the JPM caller."
"7453240","7456160"," Everybody out there is focused on it like we're going to JPM caller number. "
"7463940","7466880"," What I always like to see is this right here."
"7467020","7467920"," We touched it, right?"
"7468380","7471380"," We had the hourly come underneath."
"7472760","7474160"," Just beast mode in it. "
"7474380","7478160"," And as long as we stand this hourly, the trade is still higher."
"7484420","7486880"," Now it is getting a little bit long in the tooth."
"7487700","7488800"," So what does that mean to you?"
"7490800","7493220"," So that means we can extend here. "
"7494020","7495480"," But you're going to expect it."
"7495600","7496520"," We're going to next week, right?"
"7496780","7498140"," I'm going to assure you some."
"7498680","7500540"," We're going to next week, you're getting volatility. "
"7501140","7506620"," So you blast up here and you roll back down here and you're looking for your next dip by wherever"
"7506620","7509560"," that top is into next week, right?"
"7509660","7515780"," We got the 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th."
"7517040","7518340"," We'll be over here somewhere."
"7518620","7522180"," It'll be over here at like 225, whatever that is. "
"7522860","7528240"," Some consolidation and the bigger move higher to 300 in July, okay?"
"7528480","7530600"," 250, 300, that kind of stuff."
"7530860","7534880"," So you're going to see big, nice pushes here, right?"
"7535280","7537040"," Big, nice pushes for the JPM caller."
"7537980","7544080"," You're going to see a roll into next week and a month for June and then the explosive move up. "
"7544080","7547320"," In early July."
"7549280","7551360"," Some bullish here in Tesla overall."
"7552380","7554960"," Bullish on it, trading with the JPM caller. "
"7555920","7557820"," Nice little squeeze right there."
"7558960","7559880"," 1,129."
"7560540","7564500"," You can see that the bear's not able again. "
"7567140","7568960"," Not able to get a new low."
"7569540","7572180"," Ball is in the bull's court right now."
"7574640","7576600"," Ball in the bull's court. "
"7581090","7583590"," Are you asking me to catch?"
"7583830","7585450"," Should I enter or stay long Tesla?"
"7585730","7586830"," What's your question on chart and Tesla?"
"7588850","7590490"," Can it go higher here?"
"7590970","7591230"," Absolutely."
"7594050","7596250"," It'll likely go higher into Friday."
"7598150","7599050"," Does it?"
"7599410","7600910"," Is it sustainable?"
"7602150","7602810"," Probably not. "
"7604790","7614790"," Most traders that I know have been long for some time are looking for exits and"
"7614790","7619010"," are looking for volatility next week into end of June."
"7619350","7621610"," So we're getting like, we got three days left, right?"
"7622910","7624270"," We got three days."
"7624890","7631130"," So whenever you're long in, if you're making money, there will be a point where I would expect"
"7631130","7632530"," exiting on Friday. "
"7632530","7634470"," At some point, possibly Monday."
"7635450","7638850"," There's no news on Monday, so we could extend into Monday."
"7642210","7642850"," Spoons!"
"7643290","7653410"," Squeeze and higher on the hour 11.30. Note that on Wednesdays between 11.30 and 12.30, all"
"7653410","7656830"," your Friday call buyers step into the market. "
"7657530","7660010"," Talk about that this morning before they open."
"7660010","7663250"," 11.30. Expect all of your call buyers for Friday."
"7663970","7665230"," Step it in right now. "
"7674800","7677600"," Whales are bearish on options for Friday on Tesla."
"7677920","7678480"," I agree with that."
"7680000","7682120"," You should be wrapping it up on Friday. "
"7682780","7683620"," Wrap it up."
"7685220","7690520"," Usually Tesla on Fridays is down, so you run into Friday being down."
"7691080","7695000"," It's a good basket for zero to eight options on tech. "
"7695760","7699280"," So let's say Tesla's been down all week long."
"7700500","7702060"," And all month long."
"7702500","7709360"," Friday is a day where a hedge fund can trade zero dates on Tesla. "
"7710020","7714920"," You'll usually see them jump in and try to make a bunch of cash on Friday on Tesla."
"7715320","7720640"," This Friday, I'm thinking you're going to get FOMO running right into the weekend and you're going"
"7720640","7724140"," to see big parties exiting at some point on Friday."
"7729500","7732120"," How do you get Mondays news on Wednesday?"
"7732380","7733160"," What are you talking about here?"
"7736540","7738440"," I don't understand the question. "
"7738940","7739980"," Re-ask that question."
"7740340","7742080"," I'm not familiar with what you're asking."
"7743140","7745500"," How do you get Mondays news on Wednesday?"
"7746060","7747580"," Herms, I don't know what you mean, brother. "
"7750500","7751780"," How are you doing, by the way, Herms?"
"7764420","7766140"," I didn't see what Winky was doing in here."
"7766400","7767560"," Winky, man, you take it easy."
"7770700","7771580"," Winky's like boom. "
"7772540","7773180"," Now I'm leaving."
"7773760","7781050"," Oh, that's a good question."
"7782790","7783670"," Right here, brother. "
"7790380","7791160"," There's one for you."
"7794340","7796620"," This is the economic calendar."
"7798300","7802120"," There's better ones out there, but your basic economic calendar. "
"7805200","7806880"," None scheduled."
"7809440","7812440"," This is your basic economic calendar."
"7815840","7821480"," There are economic calendars that give you more detailed news. "
"7833480","7834400"," I like a con today."
"7834700","7839820"," I look at which ones I've got another one here that I look at for all the oil and gas"
"7839820","7840160"," stuff."
"7841060","7845060"," I think it comes from, which one do I look at?"
"7845920","7847240"," More detailed trading. "
"7847560","7848500"," I use trading economics."
"7850760","7860740"," I like major stuff."
"7864240","7865640"," Yeah, you get regular news stuff. "
"7870570","7873190"," Economic news, planned news, that kind of stuff."
"7873830","7878470"," I like your CPI reports, PPI, all that kind of stuff."
"7878610","7879370"," There's nothing on Monday. "
"7894060","7895960"," We take profit and run on Tesla."
"7896320","7898440"," I would take profit at some point on by Friday."
"7899720","7902200"," Maybe Thursday closed, depends on how we closed out the week. "
"7904420","7907700"," I'd like to see that."
"7908480","7910800"," That JPM collar is kind of the target, right?"
"7914620","7916200"," JPM collar is kind of the target."
"7916320","7919560"," If you see us tag that, probably excellent tasks. "
"7919740","7921060"," We're looking for the next jump in point."
"7924260","7925560"," Gary Doug, how are you?"
"7926800","7927900"," Appreciate the sub, brother."
"7934460","7936300"," Can you look at PayPal along?"
"7936300","7943300"," I'm along a small position at $65.50. Whatever you should sell calls against it. "
"7943560","7944160"," Yeah, I'm going to look at it."
"7951180","7953260"," Dude, I love when you guys do that with me."
"7953540","7955360"," I'm so happy to see you guys. "
"7956400","7958520"," Tell me what your positioning is and what you want to do."
"7967760","7968720"," I don't know."
"7968820","7970000"," I'm bullish on PayPal here. "
"7974110","7974610"," I'm bullish."
"7975450","7976490"," I would not be selling calls."
"7976490","7983510"," I'd be selling puts on PayPal, brother. "
"7986190","7988990"," I'm a PayPal bull right now."
"7993900","7996320"," You've got some resistance above here."
"7997180","7997760"," How about this?"
"7998080","7998740"," This is what I would say. "
"8001860","8011860"," We're rejecting right now in $65.12. If we break above $65.12 on PayPal, I'd be selling puts"
"8011860","8012300"," below."
"8015300","8017000"," I'm bullish here on PayPal."
"8019500","8020840"," I guess I'm the only one. "
"8025300","8027640"," I am overall bullish on PayPal here."
"8028360","8033260"," Even regardless of market going down, I'm bullish on PayPal to the upside."
"8033260","8039770"," Oh, yeah, some of you in them. "
"8039890","8040750"," Yeah, I'm bullish on PayPal."
"8042090","8043470"," There's some resistance here."
"8043510","8044570"," Well, you guys want to see it?"
"8045110","8045810"," Hold on a second here. "
"8049730","8051070"," Yeah, I'm bullish on PayPal."
"8051670","8052310"," I would be really."
"8053550","8055130"," I like selling calls. "
"8061640","8067340"," The thing about PayPal right now is."
"8085190","8086670"," You want PayPal right now?"
"8086830","8088530"," So you're in some weakness here, okay?"
"8088910","8089570"," I'm going to see this."
"8089710","8091450"," So you're in some weakness right now in PayPal. "
"8094170","8095670"," But your daily is not."
"8095990","8097050"," Your daily is coming up."
"8100710","8102970"," And this daily is big for you right now. "
"8103130","8104530"," So see this daily right here?"
"8105310","8106030"," This is weak."
"8107070","8108590"," So this yellow line is weakening."
"8108590","8112590"," See how it's like very bearish trading sideways. "
"8112950","8114890"," When it starts trading sideways, it becomes weak."
"8116350","8118010"," So my point to here is."
"8119290","8120910"," My point to you here is. "
"8124720","8126480"," I want that to be like four."
"8129080","8130200"," And solid."
"8143650","8145290"," You could take your position. "
"8145790","8148050"," If you wanted, like take the money and run here."
"8148290","8150570"," Like you buy this, right?"
"8151390","8152310"," Take the money and run."
"8152670","8155110"," If we come back down, you buy it again. "
"8156010","8157170"," Take the money and run."
"8158110","8158890"," Buy it again."
"8159290","8159990"," Take the money and run. "
"8160210","8161910"," This is going to break at some point."
"8162890","8163270"," To the upside."
"8164750","8168350"," So the point here is you can take the money here. "
"8170790","8172290"," Take the money and run."
"8172290","8174830"," You can even unfuck yourself if you want."
"8175990","8177090"," Take the money and run. "
"8177490","8181890"," But if you get above, I want you to know that if you get above 65 and change."
"8183850","8185910"," You're going to rip some faces off to the upside."
"8187330","8197030"," So your buy-ins are above 65.50. Your next buy-ins are down here on true range. "
"8199170","8200030"," It's ready."
"8200450","8204910"," 63.41. And right back down to 59.31. Somewhere down here."
"8205129","8205650"," Probably higher. "
"8208549","8209990"," Probably somewhere down there."
"8211870","8213690"," How about just call it flat 60."
"8217690","8218610"," Buying 60. "
"8219530","8224910"," Buying above 65.20. But this is bullish."
"8224910","8229870"," This yellow line that you see right here is going to break to the upside."
"8230650","8231309"," This is weak. "
"8231570","8232730"," This resistance is weak."
"8234129","8239389"," This is kind of like me telling bulls that they're on spy, that they're weak on the upside."
"8240389","8242230"," Bears are weak to the downside here. "
"8244950","8250549"," All these buyers, man, buying, buying, buying, buying, buying, accumulating, accumulating."
"8253590","8254430"," Sideways action."
"8256090","8259410"," You've got some seller, or you've got some trapped buyers here. "
"8260070","8261650"," I'm not going to lie, right?"
"8261950","8263610"," These are all trapped buyers in here."
"8264330","8266309"," These guys are going to try to sell on you."
"8266750","8267770"," It's not going to be easy. "
"8268610","8269650"," Like this guy wants out."
"8271410","8273209"," This guy right here wants out."
"8274530","8276209"," This guy right here wants out. "
"8276350","8277950"," They went off the ride, right?"
"8279230","8281490"," Some guys like upside down up here."
"8281629","8283910"," What is this back in May 9th?"
"8284190","8285209"," He's like, just get me out."
"8286850","8289770"," So as you come up here, they're going to try to tell you no, right?"
"8290809","8291969"," He'd be like, yeah, I'm long. "
"8292610","8293629"," And they'd be like, just take it."
"8293750","8294190"," Take it, man."
"8294389","8295530"," Buy my shit up here. "
"8297330","8298410"," Buy my shit up here."
"8298549","8299590"," And then eventually you're going up there."
"8301650","8303389"," They're going to jump back in about here. "
"8304209","8305129"," And you're going to be exiting."
"8306290","8307629"," They're going to get trapped again."
"8310270","8312190"," They're going to get trapped again. "
"8312809","8314910"," And you're going to buy it back from them again cheap."
"8315610","8317190"," And you're going to sell it to them expensive."
"8321049","8323190"," You're just getting bullish right now. "
"8324930","8326790"," You're actually just getting bullish."
"8327270","8329469"," All these clowns up here, trapped."
"8330510","8331450"," They just want out. "
"8334850","8339809"," And trust me, the moment that you go back up here, right?"
"8342110","8346650"," You're going to break above, right there, somewhere in there, 77 bucks or so."
"8347330","8348570"," And they're going to get bullish again."
"8348670","8349590"," And they're going to want to buy this. "
"8350549","8352290"," But it's going to break underneath likely."
"8354530","8355530"," And blast down again."
"8356330","8357770"," And then that's the next run up right there. "
"8358590","8359950"," It is right there."
"8361150","8362230"," Something like that."
"8363750","8366170"," And they're going to feel your whole ride right up. "
"8374320","8378049"," So I would not be selling calls."
"8378650","8379450"," Be selling puts."
"8383500","8385320"," Good job on PayPal, by the way. "
"8390890","8392390"," Can I confirm destination?"
"8393170","8396270"," I am long puts right now in the S&P 500."
"8402720","8404300"," I am long puts."
"8404580","8405660"," I have not bought any calls. "
"8406720","8407600"," I am long puts."
"8416420","8423000"," I have long puts in the S&P 500."
"8423000","8429480"," Oh, thanks for saying that, Anna. "
"8429860","8433880"," Cheever is saying that PayPal has a management meeting tomorrow."
"8434000","8435400"," That's a big one to know, right?"
"8438460","8441380"," You might not want to sell calls or ports on that meeting, man."
"8442240","8443160"," I would wait, dude. "
"8443780","8445180"," I was saying that a minute ago, right?"
"8445480","8446560"," Like above 65."
"8447520","8450260"," That's when you start buying, you start selling calls."
"8452580","8454420"," 65 is like a big deal for you. "
"8455060","8456040"," You get above that."
"8456100","8461280"," You get above that weekly and that daily with that with that hourly underneath you and that and"
"8461280","8465920"," that daily velocity is coming to the upside, you're going to rip some fucking faces off on that"
"8465920","8466160"," trade."
"8469960","8470740"," Sweet sweet. "
"8470960","8471640"," Good job, Jared."
"8474380","8475400"," I wouldn't be selling."
"8475740","8475800"," Oh. "
"8475800","8475880"," Oh."
"8485760","8487800"," Rejection on the bear plane."
"8489480","8491960"," Rejection over here in the bear plane, huh?"
"8492220","8494320"," Oh, is that the bull trap up there?"
"8494940","8499160"," Oh, all your call buyers for Friday stepping in over here. "
"8499420","8500540"," Bam, bam, bam."
"8503100","8505080"," Loading up calls for the weekend."
"8510840","8512800"," Looks like you're getting another chance at it. "
"8521790","8522790"," Oh, yeah."
"8523770","8525770"," Do we have bears in here today or bulls?"
"8526070","8527290"," That bulls are quiet today."
"8529350","8529830"," Quiet. "
"8536690","8540970"," Yeah, Hannah's saying that she's that she's still in puts me too."
"8541230","8542330"," I mean, I'm still in puts here."
"8542850","8543310"," I haven't sold. "
"8544570","8545990"," I'm Diamond Hannah, baby."
"8552610","8555470"," This is a nice trade in here that everybody calls in here and just took it up here."
"8559130","8560750"," If you're a day trader, this is a good trade. "
"8561250","8562330"," This is a great trade right here."
"8564390","8567470"," If you broke above, you'd wait for the next buy-in down there, right?"
"8568350","8570310"," This is the next leg right here for a day trader."
"8571190","8571690"," Right there. "
"8580820","8583780"," Still, bears still failing to get a new low."
"8586820","8588020"," Still failing for the bears."
"8589340","8590280"," No new low. "
"8592340","8594440"," They have the low back here at 11."
"8594600","8598220"," Well, so I guess 11 o'clock they had a new low, but 11.30 they did not."
"8598860","8605500"," They tried to sell it back down again here at 11.30. And we're now at 11.50. They got"
"8605500","8606060"," 10 minutes. "
"8606420","8607100"," They're trying, man."
"8608180","8609720"," Sellers trying right now."
"8613000","8614460"," Still failing to get a new low. "
"8618790","8620050"," I'm a bear that stays quiet."
"8620190","8620690"," I know my place."
"8622930","8627920"," Yeah, you're both bull and bear. "
"8631100","8633360"," Now, there's no such thing as bulls and bears are there."
"8633540","8633980"," Maybe there are."
"8634600","8635380"," I think new traders. "
"8638540","8640720"," Get stuck with like I'm a bull and a bear."
"8642260","8644680"," I guess I'm a bull if I were to call myself something."
"8645000","8649680"," I trade better on the on the buy side that I do the sell side I trade the south side"
"8649680","8651920"," just not as well as the south side. "
"8652260","8653520"," So I make most of money there."
"8654180","8656580"," So if that's where I make most of money, I'll keep doing it."
"8657300","8658960"," Make really good money on the buy side. "
"8663180","8664520"," Yeah, I see it too, Damien."
"8664900","8665580"," I see the bottoming."
"8668020","8669580"," They lost the hour. "
"8670060","8675620"," So I get 11.30. The bears lost the hour and the sellers are trying to reclaim it and they're"
"8675620","8676520"," not getting the new lows."
"8677360","8680580"," Like sellers need to see like this red."
"8680760","8681740"," This should have been a red candle. "
"8687550","8688930"," This should have been right there."
"8691210","8693550"," You need even if you come up here and we change this to green."
"8697290","8699130"," This is the stuff you're looking for, right?"
"8709880","8712060"," There's whatever you've been your bloodbath like right there. "
"8713580","8716980"," So this candle right here is not convincing to me."
"8717060","8718780"," See that one right there?"
"8718780","8720280"," There's not my convincing candle."
"8725140","8726800"," This candle should have been larger. "
"8740010","8743230"," This looks like just call buying for Friday."
"8744030","8745950"," Just loading the fuck up for Friday."
"8746250","8747250"," These fucking bulls, man. "
"8747350","8748450"," They will not give it up, man."
"8748930","8749750"," I'm a bull, dude."
"8750490","8751630"," Why do you guys know that?"
"8751710","8759590"," I'm a fucking bull, but I am like, like, I want you to know that there's like a FOMO bull"
"8759590","8760510"," right now out there. "
"8760510","8765950"," There's a, like, for one of me, there's normally like, like, there's like three of me, maybe."
"8766630","8767850"," I like a hundred people."
"8768410","8769330"," There's like three. "
"8771070","8775390"," And I might hear other bulls out there say things to me like, yeah, we're buying this dip or"
"8775390","8775610"," whatever."
"8777430","8780630"," Right now there's like one of me, three of me, maybe."
"8781210","8789470"," And there's like 80 bulls nonstop in your air, nonstop in your air. "
"8789470","8791310"," And it's not a bad thing."
"8791410","8797930"," It's just when you start to get that nonstop cacophony of bullishness, you're getting close, right?"
"8800850","8801730"," You're getting close."
"8801950","8802370"," You're getting close. "
"8802650","8806870"," Like when you hear like, when it's like three bills, two bulls in my air, it's one thing."
"8807450","8809670"," When it's like 20 bulls in my air, it's not so bad."
"8810190","8812050"," When there's like 50 bulls in my air, I'm not so bad. "
"8813030","8815930"," When there's a hundred fucking bulls in my air, time to fucking sell."
"8816590","8817630"," I don't care how high we go."
"8819470","8822350"," It's 70 or 80 on the number of bulls in my air. "
"8823070","8830290"," Once we hit that like 100 bulls just screaming in my air, then I know they were at a top."
"8831150","8836910"," And I also know that when I'm down there at that bottom, there's like three bulls with me."
"8837490","8838490"," Very smart traders. "
"8841250","8842350"," Extremely smart traders."
"8844310","8846750"," And everyone's on your ass like everyone."
"8846750","8848890"," Bulls are like, bulls are screaming out. "
"8848970","8849370"," You're going to crash."
"8850830","8852130"," Bears are screaming."
"8852830","8853650"," Not all bears. "
"8853810","8855150"," Let's say you have like traders, right?"
"8855470","8857410"," Let's say traders, investors, sellers."
"8857650","8857990"," Doesn't matter."
"8858090","8858570"," Sellers buyers. "
"8858610","8859190"," Doesn't matter."
"8860290","8864710"," On the bottom, I will have 80 bears yelling at me."
"8865370","8867370"," And 80 bulls yelling at me. "
"8867830","8868490"," There are a hundred."
"8869590","8870330"," And then 80."
"8870490","8870850"," There's not a hundred. "
"8870990","8873370"," Like 97 bulls, 97 bears."
"8873830","8874310"," We're going to crash."
"8876450","8876890"," Usually. "
"8878170","8882890"," Down there at the bottom, I got three bears that are like, I'm fucking closing for profit here."
"8884330","8887690"," And I got three bull bulls are like, I'm buying the fuck out of this."
"8888050","8888810"," Put some risk on. "
"8889550","8890410"," Oh, yeah."
"8890610","8891430"," Give it to me, doggy."
"8892130","8893010"," Give me that blood. "
"8893490","8893690"," Usually."
"8894230","8895190"," When we get to the top."
"8896290","8897510"," The bears get quiet. "
"8899010","8903490"," And the bulls are like, they send me DMS like, I just bought a million dollars."
"8904170","8904870"," For 600."
"8904990","8906490"," I'm like, fucking a man. "
"8907030","8908090"," I'm like, what'd you do that for?"
"8908390","8909290"," We have never seen you."
"8909470","8909830"," Never met you."
"8909910","8910670"," Never talked to you. "
"8911010","8913350"," You come to my comments on Twitter and you scream at me."
"8914190","8915290"," So shit like that."
"8915710","8921090"," And then you disappear and you delete your tweet and delete your DMS. We're kind of there."
"8921270","8923070"," We're not quite there, but we're kind of there."
"8931030","8931830"," Oh, yeah. "
"8933570","8933970"," Oh."
"8942750","8944890"," So we're kind of there right now, right?"
"8947010","8949570"," Matter of fact, I was on the phone last night with Winky."
"8950850","8952970"," I was talking to Winky yesterday at. "
"8954470","8955330"," It was late."
"8955450","8956610"," It was like four or five in the afternoon."
"8956750","8959030"," I was like, you know, I'm like, we're at that place again, man. "
"8959110","8960350"," I got to put the book and blinders on."
"8960930","8962530"," I got a cheese like trade your plan."
"8962730","8964750"," He's like trade trade with the blinders on, dude. "
"8965390","8969330"," Cause I'm like, dude, right there, like, again, I'm getting screamed at, like yelled at, screamed"
"8969330","8971090"," at, yelled at, screamed at."
"8973030","8975710"," Like this is kind of the one of the hard places to trade."
"8976250","8977570"," This is like a bottom, but a top, right?"
"8978010","8978590"," This is in reverse. "
"8980110","8981330"," As we're coming into a bottom."
"8983490","8984830"," I have to like."
"8985250","8988350"," I have to like calm everyone down, right?"
"8988630","8989790"," And then where as we're topping. "
"8992510","8994910"," Not like topping, like a roll over to a crash."
"8995370","8998030"," Just get in that place, that JPM call."
"8998190","8998690"," We tag it. "
"8998770","8999590"," We go above it a little bit."
"9000790","9002750"," Come back down for the bigger move higher."
"9003450","9004190"," That kind of shit. "
"9004510","9007770"," I'm not talking like bottoming like we're in a crash, but like just a bottom."
"9007970","9009610"," Coming into a bottom coming into a topping."
"9010830","9012410"," Just starts to get like noisy. "
"9014670","9016210"," It's getting noisy out there."
"9029560","9031300"," Who else did I talk to about that?"
"9031400","9033240"," I talked to Jedi Marcus about that."
"9033560","9034580"," I think this morning. "
"9036020","9038540"," And I don't think I talked to always yet about it."
"9039120","9040160"," I did talk to Jedi."
"9040460","9042300"," I was like, man, I don't like when we get here. "
"9042780","9046420"," I was like, I think it was this morning."
"9046960","9049140"," I think I started it late last night with him."
"9049300","9051060"," And then this morning he chatted me up. "
"9052500","9056720"," And he said this is something not the same thing, but something similar like."
"9056720","9060440"," Yeah, I get no, no want, no want to be here trading this."
"9060540","9061100"," I'm like, I agree. "
"9064880","9068060"," And earlier in the week, I was saying, I don't even want to come to the market this week."
"9068280","9069780"," Just had no, no want to."
"9087580","9089340"," I was looking for the, I was looking. "
"9089620","9091260"," So my, my view is to the upside."
"9092040","9092760"," That's a good question."
"9092760","9093680"," So my strangle from yesterday. "
"9093680","9094720"," Why did I go with 130?"
"9095840","9097480"," My view is that we're going up."
"9098680","9101980"," And my view to the downside is that it's protection."
"9103480","9106620"," If we're going down, it's like 420 is really low, right?"
"9107400","9108140"," Like 418, 417. "
"9108900","9110620"," So you guys heard me a lot past couple of days."
"9110860","9112620"," I'm like, I think even Friday."
"9113900","9115980"," Binky was saying yesterday, me and a phone call. "
"9116180","9122460"," He said on Friday, you told them you're going to consolidate next week and look for a dip to buy."
"9123440","9125680"," And he told them the prices that they would change as we progressed."
"9125680","9131020"," So for me, at least my view is to the JPM collar. "
"9131180","9133460"," It's been like that since it came out."
"9135000","9136080"," It hasn't changed."
"9136720","9140800"," So as long as we stay in trench, stay in the channel, we're going up there. "
"9141040","9144520"," Now every week I'm looking for a cheap buy in, right?"
"9145060","9147680"," This week, we started the week at, I believe."
"9148960","9153480"," We started at 425 and 416 or 18."
"9153480","9159060"," And so as we're coming into this, but we can go up from here, right?"
"9159260","9162940"," We know that we, if we're defending the hourly, we can go up straight from here from FOMO. "
"9163760","9166560"," So I've got protection down to the downside, right to 420."
"9167980","9170220"," And then my view is to the upside 430."
"9171840","9176520"," So if I can get a rip higher, I'll take the money from the calls and keep reentering. "
"9177280","9179880"," And I'll hold those 420s in case we go down there."
"9181440","9184500"," So my view is not to the downside, but it is protection."
"9185760","9189260"," I know that everything we, I know that every time we go up, right?"
"9189600","9197280"," From this point forward, I know, I know that if we go to JPM, we're rolling for a great buy"
"9197280","9197740"," for July. "
"9198180","9198760"," I know we are."
"9199300","9202420"," I know that we have a beginning of the money month flows."
"9202800","9204200"," I know we've got ball coming in. "
"9204360","9208420"," I know that June is likely down into the month from seasonality."
"9208420","9209940"," Like these are the things that I know."
"9210440","9213500"," I know that velocity is weak to the upside. "
"9214520","9216320"," So does it hold likely not?"
"9217400","9220000"," I want that, I want that next big velocity dip."
"9220600","9223400"," So like we can make that next run up to 440, 460."
"9243350","9244610"," Yeah, so that's it for me. "
"9244950","9246130"," But one to one doesn't matter."
"9246290","9248650"," If you're one to one right now, you shouldn't care."
"9249510","9253590"," If you're doing, if you, if you took your calls at the top today, right, you took calls, hopefully. "
"9253590","9255070"," I mentioned it in stream."
"9255330","9256850"," I was like, I'm closing my calls here."
"9257170","9258610"," I'm leaving my puts on. "
"9259870","9262470"," Now I've got free protection to the downside, right?"
"9262610","9264410"," If we go to 420, what am I going to get here?"
"9264890","9265650"," I won my calls."
"9266510","9268530"," I've got a free trade to the downside."
"9269830","9271250"," Free fucking free man. "
"9271330","9272870"," I've got a free put trade right now."
"9273830","9275310"," And I'm looking to buy a dip."
"9277190","9278670"," So I want to buy a dip. "
"9279930","9281510"," I've got some free fucking puts."
"9282150","9283270"," I'm up on the trade."
"9283850","9287430"," I've told you about this trade specifically from the beginning until right now. "
"9289190","9293550"," Nothing is, you know, you guys do whatever you do when you're out."
"9293650","9295450"," I'm doing what I do on my side."
"9295630","9301380"," So you still holding the puts. "
"9301580","9301880"," Dairy dug."
"9302040","9302360"," Good job."
"9304080","9305700"," Managing trades is not easy. "
"9306440","9308220"," It's a very difficult thing to do."
"9309260","9311360"," It goes against everything you want to do, right?"
"9311360","9314120"," It goes against everything your brain tells you to do."
"9314580","9317120"," Goes to everything against your emotions tell you to do. "
"9319000","9321760"," Strangles and straddles are very hard to manage."
"9321980","9324500"," They're not easy trades to manage."
"9325580","9334500"," If you learn how to do this well with me, you can apply that strategy to credit spreads. "
"9335060","9336800"," You can apply it to debit spreads."
"9337560","9342620"," And then further down the road, you can then multiply that into condors and flies."
"9343880","9347980"," And you'll be able to manage every little call and put that you're buying and selling. "
"9348500","9349800"," I'm going to take the money here."
"9349940","9350880"," I'm going to leave these on."
"9351600","9354700"," I'm going to have a whole little bank of shit just dying in the background. "
"9355000","9358140"," It's free if they print like a lot of so much the better."
"9362210","9365570"," Yeah, nobody ever goes broke taking profit and puts either."
"9365570","9370590"," If you close both sides and just walk the way in your fly right now, that's fine too. "
"9371850","9372830"," It's fine too."
"9373130","9373730"," It's all good."
"9375330","9377150"," But you're in a winning trade right now, right?"
"9377330","9379770"," You should be in a winning trade from that trade yesterday, regardless. "
"9381350","9384630"," You have a neutral S&P 500 alert right now."
"9385430","9389870"," This is a crossover or no position alert."
"9392950","9394550"," It's the warning to you out there. "
"9395750","9398610"," We're at neutral right now on the S&P 500."
"9405400","9409840"," You could take the money and run here and reset a put position to the downside."
"9411780","9416020"," If you're still bearish, you may want to re-enter again below this point. "
"9416420","9418480"," We're at neutral on the S&P 500."

"18916600","18918040"," So let's look at Amazon really quick."
"18921700","18923620"," So we were looking at Amazon yesterday. "
"18924360","18925340"," That was being asked."
"18926700","18929440"," What do I think of Amazon here?"
"18931540","18932820"," Well, let's look at it today."
"18940600","18941660"," Not bad here. "
"18942280","18943260"," Looks kind of nice."
"18944300","18945160"," Kind of dig it."
"18948000","18955280"," I'd really like it at $1.27. I'd really, really like it at $116 or $117. "
"18958780","18960220"," Kind of like it right here."
"18963820","18968380"," I do not want to see a close below 123."
"18972600","18974900"," If you see this close below 123. "
"18976540","18981660"," If we get down here and tag 121 and then get back up here, I'm down for a trade."

"18985880","18986560"," I'd be down. "
"18987560","18988240"," Love it."
"18989480","18991900"," Otherwise, what am I thinking of it right now?"
"18992020","19000880"," I like $1.16. Get a free trial like that even better."
"19002360","19008860"," So right now on Amazon, I like $1.17. Now, this is at this exact moment. "
"19009800","19016740"," I like Amazon at $1.17. We're at the bottom of a dip here on Amazon."
"19017280","19018580"," It's viable right now."
"19019040","19022560"," I can't tell you it's not viable, but here's where it becomes viable for me. "
"19026980","19030820"," Right over here, this 122, 126 somewhere in here."
"19032120","19034020"," That becomes viable for me."
"19035640","19038180"," This becomes viable for me today. "
"19039740","19044460"," I call it like 118, 117, 24 about that one."
"19045260","19046540"," That becomes viable for me."
"19047840","19057760"," If I can at least trade that right, I can probably, probably, probably, good, good chance I can"
"19057760","19060420"," probably trade that stuff in there. "
"19060700","19061400"," That's all tradable."
"19067810","19068730"," You know what I'm saying?"
"19068830","19069750"," It's all tradable in there."
"19070050","19070290"," Sure, sure. "
"19073570","19078270"," If we close above right here, yeah, I can probably trade this a little bit."
"19081170","19082850"," And then we get the giant move up."
"19083550","19084510"," Probably trade that. "
"19084730","19085990"," We're like right here right now today."
"19087030","19088450"," Yeah, I'll take my chances."
"19090230","19095430"," I'll take my chances that some foam mobile out there is going to sell me Amazon at about 117. "
"19097630","19099290"," I bet that'll be painful."
"19100170","19101450"," I bet that's going to hurt somebody."
"19105970","19111510"," Unless that, unless that foam mobile wants to throw some more money up on the table, that foam"
"19111510","19113290"," mobile wants to throw some money up in here. "
"19113730","19115650"," I'll follow him with that money."
"19116070","19117190"," No worries, I got you."
"19117890","19120590"," Otherwise though, what do we got down here?"
"19120870","19120910"," 120. "
"19122070","19123550"," Put a little mini bump in there."
"19124590","19126570"," If you buy that, I'll follow you if we go above."
"19127610","19141410"," I won't follow you right now, but if you buy this bad boy at 120 right here, do"
"19141410","19143030"," one of them dip buying bulls. "
"19143830","19145290"," You buy this and we come up here."
"19148940","19151060"," I'll buy it right here again at 123."
"19176070","19177830"," Buy stops below. "
"19180030","19182210"," Trade this up, don't touch it."
"19183130","19185690"," Gets in here, buy stops below."
"19186670","19189350"," Trade's all the way down here, buy stops below. "
"19190150","19191830"," There's your Amazon trade for you."
"19196820","19199480"," I do like seeing this green bars down here."
"19199720","19200340"," It's getting close. "
"19201240","19202720"," It's getting juicy down here."
"19202800","19204200"," I can see it's almost there."
"19205420","19209900"," When you buy down here, see good things happen, right?"
"19213470","19216270"," Yeah, Larry Williams saying buy Amazon. "
"19216870","19217230"," I agree."
"19218410","19219590"," Would mine buying it right there?"
"19223400","19225140"," Would mine buying it right there?"
"19230210","19232250"," Like that buy, but wouldn't trust it."
"19234450","19236410"," Like that buy, but wouldn't trust it. "
"19237150","19239950"," Down here, man, it's getting saucy."
"19243230","19245210"," Down here, you're looking for a dip buy."
"19246450","19248610"," There is one problem in this trade. "
"19250730","19253190"," That's that daily velocity is getting lower."
"19253770","19255510"," One step lower, one step lower."
"19256630","19258470"," When that happens, it gets nasty. "
"19259770","19261190"," You want to see what that looks like?"
"19262770","19264390"," You get this move down."
"19265830","19267510"," You get a nasty move down."
"19267670","19268610"," There's the daily right there. "

"19276660","19280640"," That's when you're down here buying this dip right here and you don't put stops on."
"19282980","19284320"," You don't wait for the confirmation."
"19285540","19287760"," What actually happens is you break through. "
"19288780","19291900"," You begin to reject and you go, yeah, I'm still long."
"19292100","19292580"," No stops."
"19300540","19301920"," This is one the bears want. "
"19304740","19306380"," They want that one right there."
"19309990","19311770"," How do you like it at $1.07?"
"19313070","19314010"," Like that one?"
"19318690","19320250"," I really like that one."
"19321330","19322470"," Trend is still up. "
"19323410","19324450"," Amazon's still bullish."
"19327910","19330250"," Believe it or not, Amazon there is still bullish."

"19352580","19354400"," Yeah, it's going to the moon in July. "
"19356780","19362140"," Meanwhile, you got trapped, stopped, stopped, gave all your money back."

"19388850","19391550"," It is nice down here like seeing this down here. "
"19391810","19393510"," I don't like seeing this down here."
"19395090","19397570"," This could get this could get dangerous."
"19398250","19399430"," Doesn't mean you can't buy this. "
"19400410","19402370"," You just got to put stops under it."
"19402370","19403850"," Like you buy it on a bounce."
"19405410","19407970"," If it rolls on you, you exit. "
"19412390","19413730"," You can buy it down here."
"19413870","19416350"," This is by the dip, by the fucking dip."
"19416710","19418990"," And this is by the M&F or dip down here, right?"

"20260770","20262930"," I guess they're going to a little long market then, aren't they?"
"20269100","20271280"," Maybe there is a bank that wants to buy on Wednesday. "
"20275970","20281890"," Maybe there is a bank somewhere out there that wants to fucking fill 500,000 contracts at the end"
"20281890","20282130"," of the day."
"20284290","20286130"," There's got to be a bank somewhere that wants that, right?"
"20286810","20287970"," This bank's going to get rich."

"20309190","20316870"," We're not contracts, but actual shares, that's 500,000 plus two."
"20317110","20318190"," Was that 50 million shares?"
"20318990","20319670"," That's a nice buy. "
"20322910","20324190"," 50 million shares."
"20326690","20329710"," I guess we aren't selling the market to the crash, are we?"
"20329810","20331730"," If you're buying 50 million shares."
"20335400","20337360"," Yeah, 50 million shares. "
"20337360","20342780"," If we close in the money here, if we close these puts in the money, somebody's buying a shit ton"
"20342780","20343920"," of puts."
"20345480","20348300"," They better not close those puts at any point."
"20348500","20349780"," Just leave them on until the end of the day. "
"20357970","20359630"," 303, one hour left."
"20361250","20363450"," Let's find out if somebody's buying the market here today."
"20364550","20366290"," Let's find out if someone's buying the market. "
"20367370","20370450"," Some algorithms like some guys running downstairs to the basement."
"20370450","20373410"," He's like, close those fucking zero dates."
"20378430","20380610"," Close those zero dates puts right now. "
"20384770","20386490"," Is that what it is?"
"20386650","20387290"," 21 billion?"
"20389990","20392630"," 21 billion in spy shares?"
"20393170","20394530"," It probably is billion, isn't it?"
"20399110","20400970"," I want to see it."
"20402210","20406470"," I want to see 500,000 spy contracts closing the money."
"20406970","20408030"," It happens sometimes. "
"20409190","20410370"," It's rare though."
"20411350","20416030"," It's like once a month."
"20418730","20420450"," I double dog dare ya. "
"20423390","20426930"," I double fucking triple dog dare ya to close those contracts in the money."
"20452850","20454430"," I double dog dare ya."
"20459900","20461640"," All right, we got one hour left. "
"20461860","20466980"," Let's talk about what to expect in the next coming days here."
"20476410","20477470"," What's the good news?"
"20479370","20488810"," Good news is if these puts close in the money, someone bought the market substantially, like"
"20488810","20490310"," big buy."
"20491250","20497030"," We have seen this buying the market frequently. "
"20498970","20505470"," Every leg up we are actually watching Winky and I in the background have been paying very close"
"20505470","20509770"," attention to how many puts or calls close in the money."
"20510890","20516150"," You know that whole argument out there that, well, maybe it's somebody with a fly and they don't"
"20516150","20518030"," mind owning it, owning the market at that point."
"20518790","20520770"," This is not you the retail trader. "
"20521510","20527430"," When you see someone closing these puts, it means they're buying the fucking market with some"
"20527430","20528330"," fucking size."
"20531250","20536310"," Like size and when they're doing size like that, they ain't playing with that money."
"20536570","20537790"," They know where the market's going. "
"20541400","20546880"," We don't see it that frequently and we only see it in markets that are being bought on the big,"
"20547580","20548460"," big money flows."
"20550400","20552780"," So just right now they're still on the market."
"20552940","20558560"," There's now 502,000 puts at 427, zero dates right now. "
"20559800","20561280"," I don't know if they leave them on."
"20561500","20563800"," If they close them, you know what that means, right?"
"20565040","20567660"," We're going to rip some fucking faces off to the upside."
"20571580","20576620"," If they pin us in here and they own them, it's not good for you being a zero date buyer,"
"20576620","20580160"," but I'll tell you what, it's not bad for you in the long term. "
"20581500","20585960"," They're not buying billions of dollars worth of shares, then dumping them the next morning for"
"20585960","20587740"," nothing, not with options."
"20592370","20598130"," Usually when we see this closure, if we see this close and they're still in these calls, or these"
"20598130","20599690"," puts, it doesn't matter, calls are puts."
"20600170","20605530"," If they're in them at the bell, it's usually a good omen, not a omen, but it's usually good for"
"20605530","20605690"," you. "
"20605990","20607150"," The market's usually going up."
"20608610","20614290"," Some fat ass out there, some fat old white guys like put an order in right now."
"20614570","20615770"," It's like I made all this money on the spread. "
"20616590","20617450"," We're going up."
"20617450","20618310"," I know it."
"20618570","20619870"," I'm the guy that makes it go up. "
"20621790","20623830"," Just pay attention to this next hour."
"20624030","20629930"," Pay attention to 427 P, 427 P, keep your eyes on that."
"20652890","20653810"," No, they disappear. "
"20654370","20656210"," They're gone and they're on, they're on and they're gone."
"20656450","20658270"," They come on the market, they come off the market."
"20659190","20661670"," They come on the market, they leave the market. "
"20663110","20664970"," You do not see these stay on the market."
"20665130","20667750"," They come on, they come off, they come on, they come off, they come on, they come off."
"20668490","20669750"," It's the largest it's ever been. "
"20674280","20676740"," I see the numbers, and then the numbers disappear."
"20677120","20678620"," I see the numbers, I see the numbers disappear."
"20679360","20681840"," Sometimes they see the numbers come on and they stay on. "
"20683040","20685820"," Very rare that they stay on, very, very rare."
"20689250","20692350"," This is OI, implied ball and OI."
"20699680","20702680"," Okay, so what are we looking at here?"
"20702680","20702840"," We don't know what we're looking at here. "
"20704880","20708780"," Known things for Thursday and Friday."
"20716350","20718130"," We did not get our down."
"20722330","20725010"," We did not get substantial down on Monday. "
"20725970","20728510"," We did not get our substantial down on Tuesday."
"20729010","20731310"," We did not get our substantial down on Wednesday."
"20733090","20735750"," I don't like all these calls up here. "
"20737350","20740050"," I don't like all these FOMO bulls up here."
"20748200","20751600"," I want more down into tomorrow."
"20758680","20759780"," That's what I want. "
"20760020","20761520"," I want more down into tomorrow."
"20762480","20763720"," Am I going to get it?"
"20765360","20766680"," I don't know."
"20772590","20776690"," I know that the VIX is at minus 14 or so, right?"
"20777070","20777950"," 13.90 something. "
"20779470","20781710"," HYG just saved itself."
"20785660","20788880"," NDX is telling me we're bearish here to this close."
"20790480","20793400"," So NDX is telling me, watch out cap. "
"20800490","20803170"," 15 minute, beer plane."
"20804950","20808510"," One hour, and kind of a beer plane."
"20809890","20812770"," Five minute, double rejection. "
"20813450","20814710"," This is the one that I like to watch."
"20814710","20815490"," See this right here?"
"20818090","20819830"," Rejection, second rejection."
"20820430","20822850"," Looking like a bloodbath into the bell here today at 4 PM. "
"20824610","20826350"," So I'm looking for two things here."
"20828070","20828990"," On the spy."
"20836170","20837570"," Let's draw it out for you. "
"20838790","20840990"," If I can get this in cash market."
"20846690","20851830"," If I can get that blood down there in cash market, I'm interested in buying a dip to the upside"
"20851830","20852430"," for tomorrow."
"20855690","20858010"," I'm interested in buying this one right now. "
"20859850","20862390"," If not, if I don't get this blood out of this close."
"20866730","20869110"," I'm expecting Thursday to be a down day."
"20875910","20877970"," Price target, tomorrow. "
"20880470","20887130"," If we can't get this today, I'm looking for 4.22.37. I am afraid here if you're not a"
"20887130","20887670"," futures trader."
"20888410","20890890"," We could do this bullshit here, right?"
"20891090","20894230"," We head down here and then it bounces before we get to cash market."
"20895050","20895970"," And then we're all saved. "
"20896190","20898750"," We get a bloodbath in futures and we come back up here."
"20899310","20902710"," So if you're just a cash market trader, this might not be the trading for you."
"20903090","20905050"," It might not be. "
"20906550","20908530"," You might get some whiplash in here."
"20913930","20917210"," Any kind of blood down here, I'm going to expect Thursday to come back."
"20917390","20921470"," If we open up down here, I'm going to expect to come back to 4.26 on Thursday. "
"20922130","20923070"," Even if it's at the bell."
"20934910","20938450"," If Thursday is red, I'm going long calls on Friday."
"20939850","20942450"," Thursdays have been like butter for bulls. "
"20943030","20944450"," Like Thursdays have been always an update."
"20944810","20945910"," Friday is always an update."
"20946510","20949790"," So I'd love to buy this in cash market right now. "
"20950730","20951410"," Love to."
"20951630","20953850"," Even if they burn it, buy them again down here on tomorrow."
"20954650","20957110"," If you can buy this shit down here, I'll buy that tomorrow too. "
"20957230","20958910"," I'll buy this close, I'll buy that open."
"20960690","20962710"," Now what would make me buy this here?"
"20963970","20966370"," Like what would tell me that I'm buying this here?"
"20969510","20971210"," I want this trade up here."
"20974430","20976170"," What would make me buy that trade?"
"20978650","20988210"," For me personally, I'll probably buy the cash open with calls tomorrow. "
"20989850","20993730"," If we opened right here, we'd be buying the fuck out of that probably."
"20997960","21001640"," See the difference in this and not that."
"21002760","21004880"," See the difference in that and not that difference. "
"21006120","21007520"," I'll buy that for a trend day tomorrow."
"21009500","21012620"," So right now for me, no calls in tomorrow."
"21019620","21022380"," You're either going to get a sexy set up on the open tomorrow. "
"21022620","21025220"," You're going to get a sexy set up on the open tomorrow one way or the other."
"21025400","21027380"," So if you're a bull, just relax."
"21028540","21031640"," On the opening bell tomorrow, you're either going to get a nice fat load of buy or you're going to"
"21031640","21033000"," be buying a trend day tomorrow. "
"21033680","21034500"," One or the other."
"21044080","21052540"," So for me as a bull, no trade long tomorrow."
"21052860","21057200"," If you can trade cash in futures, there may be a trade here for you tomorrow. "
"21059440","21063020"," If you're cash market and you want to buy this dip, I can't blame you."
"21063900","21067620"," If you're a bear, just cash market and we get out here, you're going to take the money and run."
"21069060","21071620"," If you're a bull for tomorrow, you don't need this. "
"21072260","21073940"," You just need the open tomorrow."
"21073980","21076420"," You need that sexy open for tomorrow."
"21079340","21086460"," If you want zero dates for today to run this up, I understand that trade. "
"21093720","21099680"," If we run it up into this bell and you want like zero dates, you're like, yeah, cap doing that"
"21099680","21100540"," trade right there."
"21101500","21103200"," Right up here, take the money and run."
"21103640","21107560"," Try to buy it again at 4.15 for the upside trade. "
"21107900","21109760"," There's another trade for you right there."
"21138210","21141790"," Take that trade with zero dates, come back in at the end of the day, buy another one."
"21142830","21144010"," You want to catch the overnight. "
"21170430","21173910"," I'm on zero date calls right now, but I haven't closed them yet."
"21174770","21176970"," I don't believe they're going to close these puts in here."
"21176970","21179610"," I think they're going to fucking close them between now and four. "
"21180030","21193810"," So you're still"
"21193810","21196730"," looking for 45 C and 427 next to 22 C."
"21197030","21201410"," Yeah, I'm looking for, I'm looking for these puts to get closed here."
"21201930","21202890"," They don't get closed."
"21204030","21205790"," They'll put my shittle burn, but I don't care. "
"21206210","21206930"," Made enough money today."
"21206990","21207370"," I'm doing good."
"21212270","21214970"," And look what they're trying to park it at, 426, right?"
"21214970","21219070"," Right at the pin down here. "
"21235900","21237800"," NDX retesting the lows again."
"21250450","21253170"," 317, do we get the bloodbath into the clothes?"
"21259150","21260290"," Do they pin it?"
"21264150","21265670"," Well, you can't do nothing cap."
"21265870","21267990"," I got a bunch of spreads out there. "
"21267990","21269710"," I got flies and condors."
"21271970","21273970"," I got to close them up by Wednesday, bro."
"21274050","21275330"," You can do whatever you want after that. "
"21281150","21282870"," I'm running the wheel right now, bro."
"21283170","21283990"," You already had your move."
"21306270","21307010"," Yeah, Winky. "
"21307190","21307790"," You see that, brother?"
"21313930","21315150"," I'm watching it right now."
"21315530","21317430"," And they're loading the fucking boat with them right now."
"21318110","21321810"," Now we get 17,000 more contracts on that 427 P."
"21322410","21324550"," I'm assuming that this is..."
"21325070","21326110"," You see it, dude?"
"21327550","21328670"," You watch it in the background?"
"21330390","21335650"," Now we get 17,000 more puts thrown on for 427 C or P."
"21335990","21336450"," Excuse me. "
"21337810","21339230"," This is the invisible hand."
"21339450","21339970"," These are the dealers."
"21342710","21344550"," These are the dealers, dude. "
"21345230","21346310"," There's like a blend of dealers."
"21350110","21352510"," They don't want to print either side."
"21353870","21357350"," They're like all these fucking OTM call and put buyers. "
"21358410","21360330"," Then you got the other visible hand."
"21360930","21365230"," A bunch of fucking big trading firms with flies on."
"21369030","21370530"," Another visible hand. "
"21371350","21373110"," They're like, I don't care alone all of it."
"21379710","21382230"," You got like three different hands in that pot right now."
"21388110","21389510"," It's kind of gross, right?"
"21390770","21392410"," Invisible hand's guiding the market. "
"21392670","21419570"," Invisible hand turning"
"21419570","21419930"," the wheel."
"21420990","21423650"," The greasy old white guys with bad hands in their pockets."
"21427110","21428850"," You can actually see it in real time. "
"21428950","21429530"," It's kind of crazy."
"21436090","21437310"," Is order flow real?"
"21437590","21438510"," Yeah, some of it is."
"21439010","21439930"," Some of it is not. "
"21440490","21443290"," Some of it's like a bunch of old white guys."
"21443990","21444870"," It's like woo-hoo."
"21445950","21446850"," It's our market. "
"21446970","21447390"," We own it."
"21448450","21450510"," You can jump along for the ride if you need to."
"21472480","21475340"," Yeah, as long as you're not in the way, Winky just said, I agree with that, Winky. "
"21475820","21477720"," Just don't get in their fucking way, right?"
"21483740","21487360"," Do not get in their way."
"21516140","21519440"," Selling 40 cents on 427 C's."
"21558380","21559360"," Let me know in the chat. "
"21559540","21560240"," Hey, Winky, can you?"
"21560380","21561620"," I know you're not working, brother."
"21562180","21563360"," Right on, Winky Faze."
"21563420","21563860"," I love you, brother. "
"21567940","21568900"," I love you, bro."
"21575770","21577170"," How about this in the chat?"
"21578030","21578650"," Let me know."
"21580010","21581250"," Yeah, we need a poll, bro. "
"21581250","21581850"," We need a poll."
"21582290","21585130"," Are we going up tomorrow or down tomorrow in the open?"
"21585470","21585990"," Up or down?"
"21586150","21587270"," It's going to be up or down, definitely."
"21588090","21590650"," Do we open up tomorrow or down?"
"21591550","21592970"," Up or down from here?"
"21593350","21594330"," Yeah, right here. "
"21594870","21596290"," Do we open up of this?"
"21596610","21598350"," Do we open above or below 425?"
"21599150","21599570"," That's the question."
"21599930","21601750"," Do we open above or below 425 tomorrow?"
"21603410","21604390"," Yeah, my man."
"21609960","21611620"," We're going to do a poll right now. "
"21611620","21614020"," Because I don't know how to set the polls anymore on streamlabs."
"21614200","21616760"," I still haven't fucking looked it up some of the time."
"21617060","21619720"," Do we open above 425 or below 425?"
"21622060","21623300"," Poor 60, baby. "
"21623860","21624500"," I love you, bulls."
"21625360","21625520"," I do."
"21625700","21627220"," I am a bull, so don't worry about it. "
"21631480","21632300"," No, no, no."
"21632440","21633840"," Tomorrow, we're talking about tomorrow."
"21636400","21637080"," Thank you, Winky. "
"21637260","21637700"," I love you, brother."
"21638420","21639460"," I really do, Winky."
"21639460","21640280"," I want you to know that. "
"21642520","21644720"," 425, up or down?"
"21645440","21645960"," I don't care."
"21646460","21649020"," So 425, up or down?"
"21654050","21655390"," Yeah, there you go, Claude."
"21656690","21657570"," Claude's in the background. "
"21657950","21658750"," Claude knows what's up."
"21663020","21664180"," Tommy Lee, baby."
"21664480","21665420"," Showing the dog to bears. "
"21667960","21669500"," Up or down tomorrow."
"21669960","21670620"," Answer the question."
"21674020","21675160"," Good, good point. "
"21675460","21677020"," Purple, Tom, makes a very good point."
"21678060","21680660"," As long as we're above 4.2069, I'm bullish."
"21682160","21683080"," Nice answer. "
"21684140","21685020"," Mac Quella."
"21686180","21686680"," Sand down."
"21692230","21693150"," I think. "
"21694510","21696470"," Let me take a look in the background and see what I think."
"21698390","21699250"," Let me take a peek."
"21705270","21713610"," Oh, I know these fucking bears are looking at this clothes and they're like these. "
"21713750","21715550"," I know for a fact these bears are like."
"21716630","21718170"," We're going the fuck down."
"21718350","21720390"," They're like, we're going to 1387. "
"21723570","21724470"," That's NDQ."
"21729500","21731260"," Oh, yeah, these fucking bears, man."
"21731260","21735540"," Yeah, I think we're going down tomorrow. "
"21737540","21739200"," I'm on the down trade for tomorrow."
"21740080","21741260"," One more leg down."
"21748270","21751250"," Oh, your wife's boyfriend's saying, up, baby, up. "
"21752830","21755330"," I think we have one more leg down in the overnight."
"21756510","21756970"," Hey, buddy."
"21760990","21762930"," I'm in the down move. "
"21762930","21765510"," You like to get that last leg down, chasing the hole?"
"21765790","21766630"," I think we chase the hole."
"21767590","21771630"," We either chase it in the next half hour or we're chasing it overnight."
"21773070","21773850"," We're either doing this. "
"21774450","21776450"," I shouldn't say we're going to be down tomorrow."
"21776650","21780110"," I should say we're either down into this fucking bell, hard and heavy."
"21781450","21782270"," We're getting it. "
"21782430","21786250"," We're going to open down one or the other."
"21790790","21795970"," So Putin and the Saudi Crown Prince talked during a bilateral corporation by phone."
"21796970","21800910"," This is the first chance the bears have had in a while to sell Nasdaq. "
"21801130","21802290"," I'm going to go with them on this one."
"21803270","21808230"," Saudi Crown Prince talking about bilateral corporation by phone."
"21808830","21810810"," They're going to re-eventstrate this shit all the way down. "
"21810930","21811670"," I get not all the way down."
"21811750","21815670"," They're going to re-eventstrate it down to, what do they say they would re-eventstrate it to?"
"21817290","21819990"," Yeah, these fucking bears want 14, 289."
"21821050","21822790"," Keep your eye on that number right there. "
"21823690","21824630"," 14, 289."
"21827770","21828870"," 14, 289."
"21829250","21833010"," If they can touch that shit before the end of the bell today, I'll buy some calls. "
"21835330","21836370"," 14, 289."
"21839790","21841310"," It's going to be really close here."
"21842690","21843530"," I might be buying. "
"21843730","21844910"," Hey, I'm going to set up some calls."
"21846850","21847810"," Okay, hold on here."
"21847970","21848450"," Hold on here. "
"21850310","21851110"," June 8th."
"21854310","21855110"," June 8th."
"21855970","21857390"," Ooh, calls are getting cheap. "
"21860570","21861150"," They're cheap."
"21863890","21864470"," 428s missing."
"21865150","21866290"," Oh, yeah, here it goes, dudes. "
"21868250","21869970"," Well, they're holding their value, too."
"21870850","21874410"," I'm watching tomorrow's calls right now, and they're not even losing value right now."
"21875730","21877850"," Oh, there's the swing right there. "
"21879030","21880290"," These fucking dealers."
"21883430","21889330"," So I'm looking for calls only if Nasdaq keep going a little bit lower."
"21889850","21891330"," It's kind of there, isn't it?"
"21893390","21897330"," Look at Nasdaq just bleeding down to 14, 289, 2, 0."
"21928060","21932240"," We're like right at the bottom of the barrel on Nasdaq here. "
"21940790","21942690"," Right at the bottom of the barrel right now."
"21945110","21948110"," Oh, there goes the, is that the capitulation pin right there?"
"21949270","21951310"," 14, 3, 1, 5, that's it."
"21951850","21952490"," Okay, plus cooperation. "
"21954930","21965000"," I guess, I guess we are throwing hand grenades and horseshoes, aren't"
"21965000","21965140"," we?"
"21971570","21972950"," Close enough, is that what you're saying?"
"21973030","21974150"," It's close enough for the down move."
"21976930","21978330"," Taking enough from the, from the bulls."
"21979930","21981330"," It's kind of close, isn't it?"
"21982970","21984230"," It's pretty fucking close. "
"21984750","21988410"," Early marked on closing balance, currently sitting at 570 million."
"21988570","21989390"," Oh, don't worry about it, Winky."
"21990430","21992130"," Okay, so the pole is up. "
"21994190","21998230"," Below 425 or above 425 is the answer you do."
"21999110","22002730"," I-V-O-T-E, space bar."
"22003410","22008070"," And then one word, A-B-O-V-E, no space, 425. "
"22009630","22012650"," Or I-V-O-T-E, space bar."
"22013730","22018030"," One word, B-E-L-O-W, no space bar, 425."
"22027360","22029420"," I'm still watching NASDAQ over here. "
"22029500","22030960"," I want to see if there's a last little flush."
"22034480","22036100"," The pole is open."
"22036240","22037340"," Do we open above or below?"
"22043830","22045350"," Look at NASDAQ, dude. "
"22046030","22047330"," Got fucking wrecked."
"22052430","22053810"," NASDAQ got hammered."
"22060310","22062590"," We're going to call that like a triple top or something. "
"22070490","22071950"," NASDAQ got hammered."
"22074670","22078090"," NASDAQ's looking for a relief rally and then a rejection of the downside."
"22080090","22083150"," Bears ready to fuck some shit up on NASDAQ, man. "
"22083910","22090310"," Like even if NASDAQ comes up to like 14, 411, these bears are going to want to rip some faces"
"22090310","22091590"," off to the downside again."
"22092490","22093690"," They have a lot of work to do."
"22098870","22104250"," Bears are like, I want to sell 14, 413 and then send it down to the depths of hell again. "
"22105850","22107850"," They're going to ragdoll tech, aren't they?"
"22111270","22112990"," Oh yeah, they're going to ragdoll tech."
"22113730","22114990"," The one hour says down."
"22119690","22120650"," Oh boy, dude. "
"22120810","22123390"," These fucking, these fucking bears."
"22123610","22124810"," We're not done going down on tech."
"22124970","22125790"," I can assure you that. "
"22126270","22127090"," I don't think we are."
"22129890","22130630"," We're not done."
"22133410","22135090"," Yeah, close that 350. "
"22135550","22137830"," I think we get the bounce, but then I think we're going back down again."
"22138350","22141650"," Maybe get the relief rally tomorrow and then we go down some more on NASDAQ."
"22141650","22142790"," They're going to try to drown it. "
"22142870","22143490"," You can see it."
"22145170","22146330"," They want a murder tech."
"22146950","22148630"," Or they want a murder that you know what they want to murder. "

"23670970","23672770"," Derry Doug saying he bought a straddle."
"23672870","23674290"," I think the straddle is the better trade. "
"23675350","23678090"," I haven't bought it, but I was thinking about adding some puts."
"23678290","23683450"," There's some dirt cheap 420 P's for I think 12 cents on Friday."
"23683450","23687090"," I was thinking about adding a bunch of those just like 12 cents. "
"23687270","23690610"," If I can't get 12 cents on the call side, it'll pay for the trade."
"23690970","23692870"," So I'm like, yeah, maybe I will buy them."

"23712300","23713740"," They're 13 cents right now."
"23713860","23716020"," They were 12 cents like fucking five minutes ago."
"23716020","23719660"," So there is some OI on that shit. "
"23719920","23721460"," There's definitely OI on that trade."
"23723200","23726840"," 420 P, 13 cents for Friday, a couple days from now."
"23727700","23732340"," So if you get the like the magical overnight roll over to the downside, you can cover the calls"
"23732340","23733560"," that you bought for Friday. "
"23734640","23735780"," It's not a bad trade."
"23735960","23737340"," I'm not into that trade for tomorrow."
"23756750","23762830"," Yeah, straddle town's not bad here, especially if it's dirt cheap, like 12 cent puts for Friday. "
"23763690","23765250"," Who fucking cares if they burn?"
"23765650","23767710"," If we're going up, right, you're not going to care."
"23769050","23771110"," If we're going down, you're going to care."
"23771870","23777150"," I mean, like if we're going up, right, if we're going up into Friday, you're not going to give a"
"23777150","23778870"," fine fuck about 12 cent puts burning. "
"23779730","23780890"," That's like a bump in the road."
"23782670","23792550"," But if we roll over here, you're going to be like, Yeah, there might be 14 now, but they were"
"23792550","23793730"," 12 like five minutes ago."
"23798600","23803540"," The trade that we're talking about is 429 C for tomorrow. "
"23804760","23807560"," And I think I got 430s, right?"
"23810040","23812780"," I got 430s for Friday."
"23814220","23820340"," And then we were talking about putting on a 412 P for 12 cents for Friday as well."
