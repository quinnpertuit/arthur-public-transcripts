"2039150","2046830"," target on or my second outcome for like next probability would be the sideways trade into the close"
"2047550","2055330"," The least probability is the crash down below and less less price shows us that So let's see how it"
"2055330","2056469"," works itself out in the close."
"2057010","2069920"," We've got it's now 321 And you know"

"2946180","2956090"," please That one right there That"
"2956090","2958250"," was the go fuck yourself fools."
"2958910","2968680"," I fucking hate you That was the escape clause You want to know what the escape clause"
"2968680","2971920"," was that one right there That was the get me out of my trade. "
"2972160","2984580"," Let me exit please before you run me over That"
"2984580","3000060"," was the that was your orderly exit candle Any"
"3000060","3003640"," chance of a hike tomorrow, uh, yeah, we went over that earlier too."
"3003640","3010500"," We'll go over again Uh, we'll do it one more time for the clothes so you guys know Highest"
"3010500","3020000"," probability for tomorrow is no rate hike or no rate cut Your Other highest probability is you're"
"3020000","3027000"," going to see a reinforcement in likely some language change from the fed of a more davish tone"
"3028320","3030520"," Along with that more davish tone."
"3030520","3038580"," They're also likely going to tell you that it's not going to be uh, back-to-back rate cuts That'll"
"3038580","3042500"," be data dependent That they're looking for the next rate cut. "
"3042840","3047580"," It's and that the language should change So they're at a point where there are too many rate"
"3047580","3054380"," decisions left this year They likely have the ability to cut rates two or three times with spaces"
"3054380","3063880"," in between I do think that that uh the the option for them to increase rates Uh becomes more valid"
"3063880","3071300"," once they have cut rates skip the rates hike or cut Maybe even cut rates once more than skip a"
"3071300","3071720"," rate cut."
"3071920","3080960"," I think yes You have the ability to rediscuss rate hikes Now Let's do some more talk here."
"3081020","3088940"," So that's that's that's that's my take It's the most probable answers to what happens Your second"
"3088940","3098860"," thing that's most probable would be a rate cut tomorrow If you get a rate cut tomorrow Uh, you"
"3098860","3108640"," should see a huge huge exuberance green bar Straight up"
"3110420","3117680"," I would not take that as bullish I would take that as a liquidity grab to launch the market much"
"3117680","3124260"," lower in a big way Now the fed has no reason to cut tomorrow if they do cut ahead of"
"3124260","3130400"," schedule Or without them being in that like uh that we've got more time to cut Now I would take"
"3130400","3137260"," that as bearish If they do a rate cut tomorrow the initial reaction or rate increase tomorrow 25"
"3137260","3140480"," bps The initial reaction will be bearish. "
"3140720","3147360"," We'll have a big downside move, but you want to buy that Because the fed is still working and still"
"3147360","3148800"," taking inflation seriously."
"3149080","3153180"," They have not broken anything That's your least probable outcome."
"3153500","3155120"," But if it does happen you're in your brain. "
"3155420","3161480"," You're going to want to think that's bearish And it isn't you're going to be hands off Looking for"
"3161480","3168160"," a place to buy that dip Okay, so it's count all of it is counterintuitive to what a lot of"
"3168160","3176680"," what you're thinking is out there Um, this is historically proven from every prior instance There's"
"3176680","3183120"," a few small instances where it does not prove itself But we're talking about like 85 percent of the"
"3183120","3192980"," time versus 15 percent of the time All right, the other thing here too is that none of the"
"3194220","3201200"," macro information Is showing any of that happening So in the background we're not seeing any"
"3201200","3210900"," velocity in jobs Job quits job starts employment New jobs any kind of jobs We don't see the"
"3210900","3217260"," velocity and inflation right now up or down This all looks like massaging and bullshit from the fed"
"3218100","3224760"," so So there's nothing even to Make me think that that stuff's happening now."
"3224880","3232400"," There is one thing against the bulls and that is Some of the things that we do see That you"
"3232400","3239040"," can see out there in real life Like the five guys thing right well five guys go bankrupt their"
"3239040","3244860"," chance Do I think that one day you could be walking down the street and see the McDonald's"
"3244860","3245100"," bankrupt?"
"3245580","3246440"," That's a fucking lily."
"3246900","3252700"," No, that sounds crazy too But a lot of the damage that they're doing you can see it in The"
"3252700","3258900"," business world you can see That that prices are going higher people are not buying and there's this"
"3258900","3268420"," race from some companies to continue to chase More money not profit more money You Can see it in"
"3268420","3274220"," the price of goods sold So are they doing damage out there they are there they are truly doing"
"3274220","3280200"," damage that you can start to see the cracks in it right now Without a doubt you can start to"
"3280200","3287000"," see the cracks in it Right now here goes the squeeze They're squeezing out sellers right now. "
"3287060","3287940"," They're panicking again."
"3288220","3293160"," You see the fucking pissed off candle of anger down here This was your orderly exit and you're"
"3293160","3303530"," getting squose once again into the clothes today Well,"
"3303770","3305450"," there's the other thing too at the dot plot."
"3305590","3310990"," I want to tell you guys about this like the dot plot go into two Or fed funds rate fed's"
"3310990","3316790"," future funds rate saying like oh, we're at three and now we're at two That is more has more to"
"3316790","3323750"," do with gambling or trading the market than it does with reality So you've got you got a you got"
"3323750","3329190"," a trainer saying hey, we're coming into some ball events, right We're going to expect Some some"
"3329190","3336350"," danger and some ability to talk danger scare people Right, I tell you this sometimes right they'll"
"3336350","3341750"," tell you we're going to crash but they get out before we crash It's more about the trade than it"
"3341750","3347490"," is about a conviction It's about trying to make money than it is about a conviction So I tell you"
"3347490","3351470"," we're going to go to the down down to the depths of hell We trade it down to where their"
"3351470","3357150"," target is they get out and you get left holding the bag drinking the Kool-Aid That's not really"
"3357150","3361690"," what they think And that has a lot to do with the dot bot too, right?"
"3362030","3367010"," You tell everybody oh, you know, you're only getting two rate cuts this year You're only getting"
"3367010","3372350"," one right the reality is the fed has told you you're going to likely get two cuts this year minimum"
"3372350","3378770"," If not three the reality is they told you that they're likely won't be back to back The reality is"
"3378770","3388850"," they only have so many fed meetings left this year and they will They will Price in Those"
