"_i07-eFwW4Y","307960","332960"," All right, good morning traders hold on a second. Okay, we've got a sore through it this morning. Just off the bell right here, right? We want to break above"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","332960","355960"," I'm gonna keep my talking to a minimum this morning at this point. So we're breaking above this little red red line right here. We're not quite constructive yet, but we need to break above this pivot point here at 395 15. You need to see this break above"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","355960","372960"," And we're buying this morning, but the moment that we capture this pivot and then you want to stay above the moving averages as long as we stay above the moving averages, you'll see some sort of consolidation in a trend higher"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","373460","385960"," Now, if the bulls cannot do that today at any point or at any point not stay above the moving averages. If we break below here, we're sitting doing a different color here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","385960","399960"," So these moving averages as they come into play today, right? We will trade off of them"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","400960","403960"," Or below them. Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","403960","412960"," So you're gonna see you're gonna see this happen. No, we could trade sideways, but the key here is if you're a bear."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","412960","420960"," Anything below these moving averages, you're going to see eventual selling at some point. Okay, we're we're in a negative gam environment. So"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","421960","434960"," The only way to trend up to have like a snapback rally of any kind, you have to stay above these moving averages to just stay stay watching the confluence of these moving averages today."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","434960","438960"," And you'll see you'll you'll see how this interacts over the coming days."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","438960","445960"," I'll show if you want to show examples of how this happens as the market begins to sell off this morning, but just give me a minute. Just give me a minute."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","445960","449960"," Let me get the levels in and then we'll look at it again."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","449960","461960"," Just let the market right now breathe and do it do its thing. Matter of fact, they have got some calls. I'm gonna take a look at the same time for a minute."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","461960","464960"," By the way, good morning, all of you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","479960","497960"," All right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","497960","502960"," Oil futures extend gains in volatile market, Brent crude up by $1 a barrel."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","528960","541960"," Then we are currently above moving averages right now, which is which is positive for the market to go higher today."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","542960","565960"," Hold on here. I'm going to get a look at my positions here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","565960","571960"," Yeah, so this is good. I'm up right now, but dollar six yesterday, I started a position at 40, 42 cents, I think."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","571960","578960"," And then went back in at 70 something cents towards the end of the day or to a dollar five right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","578960","585960"," If you look closely at the options chain, there's 25,000 contracts on 395 C."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","585960","593960"," Yesterday at the close, I was telling you to there was like, I think someone was on a for everything. There's a large position at 400."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","593960","602960"," And I told you to expect that that position to move higher and you're seeing that this morning. So they moved up from 400 C to 395 C."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","602960","606960"," I was talking to you yesterday about taking that position slightly higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","606960","611960"," One to four strikes outside of outside the money."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","611960","616960"," So 396 is their fucking beautiful this morning. Congratulations. If you're a fucking bull and bought that shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","616960","624960"," Don't hesitate to take some goddamn fucking profit right now. Right where we are. Okay, take some money off the table that a few runners run."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","624960","637960"," And if you took that trade into close yesterday, congrats. You guys are saying."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","637960","648960"," Oh, no, not not covert flu. When you talk all day long like that. And then of course, like trying to pump up the market last or yesterday at four o'clock. It's just that the courts get sore."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","648960","651960"," That's the only reason why I don't want to talk too much this morning."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","651960","658960"," No, no, no, no sick, no nothing. Now, dollar seven on those calls."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","658960","664960"," Take some money. I'm going to sell some right here. Take some profit and leave some runners on. So just heads up on that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","664960","668960"," Yeah, nothing like that. Hello, you guys doing."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","668960","676960"," It doesn't matter to me. I have long COVID. Yeah, no COVID. Then that stuff. Just more when you're talking all day long repetitively repetitively."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","677960","686960"," I'm going to show you guys some right here. Okay, we're going to go through some right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","686960","693960"," Hang tight here. Explain it to you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","693960","702960"," Yeah, not muted this morning. I made a post on Twitter this morning. Wait, my vocal cords are sore right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","703960","709960"," I'm going to show you guys something this morning. What I'm trying to explain to you, okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","709960","713960"," So I want you if you're a bull, if you're a bear, it doesn't matter. Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","713960","725960"," This is going to be a really quick explanation. Okay, so people are always like, um, how do you know if we're going up or going down when we start to get where we get, we're going to sell off for a minute."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","726960","732960"," Hang tight here. You don't have to worry about the levels. Just you know where the resistance levels are."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","732960","747960"," That's why you really need to know at this moment. I want to show you so I can see that some of you guys don't know how to look for trends and trend when trend changes. Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","748960","754960"," So first off, you see how we're tagging right now. This pivot. I want you to see this pivot point right here. Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","754960","761960"," Um, this is an intro. When I when I post the point, it means that this is your intraday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","761960","767960"," Um, who's in charge? Okay. It's the first thing you want to look at every single day. So this pivot point right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","767960","776960"," You can see we're pinging it right now, right? Is that paying? And the first thing you're going to be looking for each day is if we trade to that point, wherever it is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","776960","780960"," And then it's going to it's going to give you a kind of an idea of."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","780960","784960"," Are we to make sure you take some off at this point? Okay. Take some profit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","784960","790960"," When you buy zero dates, it's a directional move. I want you to understand that you can reenter the trade again."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","790960","795960"," But it's a directional move. You buy them. You pick the direction. You take profit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","795960","805960"," Okay. You can reenter the trade again if we go above the pivot point. But until then, this is a key indicator for you. I don't know if you guys know how important this is this pivot point."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","805960","813960"," Because this, this is the first thing you're looking for. Are we trading above that point? Are we trading below that point? Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","813960","816960"," That's your like your first key indicator for the day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","816960","820960"," Hold on a second here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","820960","822960"," Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","822960","828960"," It's critical that you, that you, you'll, you'll, we, we should magnet to it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","828960","834960"," On the opening bell every morning. You can see we're paying to it today. We did it. We did it yesterday. It doesn't show on this chart right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","834960","842960"," But we did. There's like a hidden yesterday. It was here, but there was a, there was a hidden, like we actually went, we attempted to go to the pivot."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","842960","848960"," And then we sold right off of it yesterday. It's not showing on this chart, but it did show up on the chart yesterday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","848960","857960"," In most days, you should see that most days, you see, you should see as at least attempts to pivot to trade to it. And then we'll make a decision on the direct market direction."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","858960","864960"," Now, we sold off right past few days here when selling off down. I'm going to show you examples in the past."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","864960","868960"," So you guys can understand what I'm talking about with the moving averages."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","868960","871960"," You see he's moving averages here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","871960","874960"," You see how we're selling off of it here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","874960","877960"," So he sold off it here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","877960","882960"," And you see how we're now, you see the moving averages are now underneath us."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","883960","898960"," Or we're above the moving averages right now. If the moving averages hold, right, you'll see a trade higher. If you see the moving averages stabilize and come sideways and we're still above it, you'll see consolidation."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","898960","902960"," If you see us start to break below. This is like the reactive trade, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","902960","906960"," You see these moving averages, we start to get below those moving averages."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","906960","910960"," We're eventually going to start the continuation of selling off. Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","910960","912960"," And I'll show you examples of this right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","912960","913960"," Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","913960","916960"," It's probably better to do like a different color."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","916960","923960"," And you can see the blue and you see the blue and the blue, the green and the white."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","923960","929960"," Right here, you're going to use these as we pig to the to the pivot point, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","930960","938960"," You want to see if you're bullish on today or if you're if you're like, oh, we're definitely going back up to see the crime."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","938960","943960"," We need to stay above."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","943960","949960"," You stay above these to return to the crime or consolidate above for the move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","949960","955960"," If we break below and start to consolidate, you're going to actually see us start selling lower. Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","955960","960960"," I'll show you guys examples examples of this right now. Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","960960","967960"," I'll give you just a second here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","967960","972960"," That's probably not the best."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","972960","975960"," I don't want to make a chart. It'll show kind of similar. Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","975960","982960"," So you see this is a two hour chart. It doesn't really matter if it's like I can do a 15 minute chart."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","982960","993960"," But you can see it right here is a prime example and a woman at Charles showed the same way."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","993960","997960"," You get the initial sell down right here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","997960","1001960"," And you'll notice we'll come right back up into the moving averages."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1002960","1018960"," Water."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1018960","1022960"," Take a few days of selling down right consolidation move."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1022960","1027960"," We break above, right? You'll see that too. Even today you'll see that break above."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1027960","1033960"," You're good to go to take along. The moment we start breaking down through these moving averages, you will start to see selling down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1033960","1037960"," Then they then then you take control and you keep pushing it down. Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1037960","1041960"," I should maybe I'll take some screenshots and show it to you in a one minute chart."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1041960","1045960"," Think tight."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1045960","1049960"," But if you're a bear, that's what you're looking for."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1049960","1056960"," I'm going to tee off."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1056960","1061960"," You're looking to tee off on these moving averages."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1061960","1068960"," This is the one minute chart right now, right? See, he's moving average. Come in right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1068960","1071960"," As long as we stay above right here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1071960","1075960"," Should start to see the market to head higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1075960","1079960"," So you're going to use the we're going to use these moving averages."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1079960","1083960"," Of course, get that resistance. This point is not a good sign right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1083960","1087960"," You'll see these moving averages come in right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1087960","1090960"," Right. This is where the bulls are in charge."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1090960","1100960"," Move up, down, up, down, three, usually a move higher. You want to take a trade off this, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1101960","1106960"," If you see consolidation off of these moving averages right here, you should at some point."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1106960","1108960"," And move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1108960","1112960"," If the consolidation is too long, it'll turn distribution and start trading under."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1112960","1115960"," This is where you put your stop losses in and then take a bear trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1115960","1118960"," Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1118960","1122960"," That's a bear trade. God damn bears."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1122960","1128960"," Does that make sense? So this is how you deciphering direction directional moves."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1128960","1133960"," Especially, especially, especially in a negative game environment."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1133960","1137960"," See that right here?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1137960","1141960"," This is the opening bell, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1141960","1144960"," What did I tell you? What did I tell you up here? I said, take profit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1144960","1147960"," So you take profit up here, right? Take your money and run."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1147960","1150960"," If you're a bull and you're like, well, I'm still bull, share cap."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1150960","1154960"," You don't care what you're saying or people on Twitter told me this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1154960","1156960"," People told me that or whatever."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1157960","1163960"," Your next entry for a long would be offer a reaction play coming on the off here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1163960","1164960"," Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1164960","1168960"," And you'll be looking for that. How do you look? How do you enter a long trade here?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1168960","1170960"," You'll see us come down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1170960","1172960"," I'm going to change the color here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1174960","1179960"," I'm going to see us come down, right? You're going to want to see one, two, three, and then move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1179960","1182960"," You're not going to enter the trade right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1182960","1187960"," You're going to enter it on the first or second, maybe even the third bounce higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1187960","1188960"," Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1188960","1191960"," If you're, if you're a bear this morning."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1194960","1198960"," If you're, if you're a bear this morning, right, you're going to wait for the interaction here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1198960","1201960"," You're going to be looking for some kind of failure below."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1201960","1202960"," Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1202960","1204960"," So you'd be waiting for this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1206960","1211960"," Be waiting for a failure down here. One, two, maybe even three, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1211960","1215960"," You want that resistance trapping bowls in here and you take that move lower."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1215960","1216960"," Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1217960","1219960"," And the first like five, 15 minutes."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1220960","1225960"," This isn't going to tell you immediately off the open to a magnet."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1226960","1232960"," But if we stable down below here, right, you see that rejection and you see continued rejection down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1233960","1235960"," And you can forget about the VWAP to some extent."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1235960","1238960"," You're trying to find out the trend for the day. Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1239960","1242960"," If we start trying down here in your bowl and you're like, Oh shit, we're selling down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1242960","1244960"," This is going to tell you right away trend for the day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1245960","1246960"," Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1246960","1247960"," We're consolidating and moving lower."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1248960","1250960"," We're consolidating and moving higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1251960","1252960"," You guys understand all that out there?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1254960","1258960"," I'm hoping that you even spend enough time with me to know that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1258960","1259960"," Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1259960","1261960"," So I told you not to buy that original, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1261960","1270960"," You're looking to see what the interaction is off of this, this confluence right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1271960","1274960"," So just waiting to see what happens, the interaction."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1274960","1281960"," You don't, you know, you've got big computers out there that are going to show you the way for you to make a decision as to where we're headed for the day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1282960","1284960"," And what your positioning should be."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1285960","1291960"," I'm going to see this right here. If you're a bully, you're, you're, you're just going to sit here and wait."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1291960","1292960"," Took your profit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1292960","1299960"," You want to sit here and see if you get at least some kind of one, two, three bounce and, and often running."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1299960","1303960"," If you start to see his break below this confluence right here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1303960","1308960"," Start grinding below it here. One, two, then we start to pick a direction for the day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1308960","1313960"," Oftentimes you'll find traders will tell you, uh, I don't trade the first five, 15 minutes or whatever."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1313960","1316960"," You want to, you want to find out the direction of the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1316960","1331960"," Uh, you have a higher probability of making money each day, finding out what, what the direction is for the day, which where we're going, and then you can go level to level and look for major supports below and major resistances above."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1331960","1334960"," Is that helping you guys this morning, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1334960","1336960"," 100 people here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1337960","1342960"," Okay, so."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1342960","1346960"," It's right here. You can actually see it happening right now, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1346960","1351960"," You want to see that you get the one, two, three, and we'll, we'll start a continuation up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1351960","1355960"," You've got our one right here. You've got, uh, no, that's not our one."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1355960","1360960"," Anyways, give me a minute here and I'll get the fucking levels done for you. Give me just a second."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1360960","1365960"," Good morning. Hope you all do well this morning."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1366960","1368960"," Hold on here. Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1371960","1374960"," Also note that we have more sellers than buyers this morning."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1376960","1380960"," So we got a pivot point, our one, our two, our three."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1380960","1384960"," This is the return to the scene of the crime kind of thing. Sometimes this can take a couple days to."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1384960","1389960"," I didn't want to, I was going to post this this morning and it did not put it to words. You could see."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1389960","1394960"," Um, I think yesterday, since the close, I was telling you guys that, um."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1395960","1400960"," Sometimes this takes time. This can take like two, three days before it actually rockets up, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1400960","1405960"," Uh, and we've got this area above here. This R one is going to be major resistance."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1405960","1411960"," So I want you guys to see that over here. Okay. Uh, that's three 98 70. Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1411960","1417960"," Uh, and then you've got this next level, this next short above up here. That's a four, oh."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1417960","1422960"," A four, three 50. So major R two, major R one up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1422960","1424960"," Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1424960","1428960"," Just some things to keep, keep within, uh."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1428960","1435960"," It's an interaction up here in the five minute chart. All right. Hold on a second here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1435960","1441960"," I'm talking again. I'm not, I told myself I wouldn't talk to someone. I'm like, I'm going to rest my vote boards."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1441960","1444960"," I'm not doing that right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1444960","1446960"," Hold on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1475960","1485960"," One other note, no, two is sometimes you'll hear, uh, bull say, oh, we'll get out of S one test. S one will test previous lows."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1485960","1490960"," I can put those in there for you. They'll look for this as a jumping point."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1490960","1495960"," Uh, you can."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1495960","1500960"," It can be very dangerous in a, in a bearish environment."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1500960","1503960"," Hold on here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1503960","1516960"," You'll often hear, hear, uh, bull say this, right? They're looking for, for at least a retest previous lows. I'm going to post those right here. You see those. These are previous low right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1516960","1521960"," A little bit of a low down here. Sometimes you'll hear a bull say."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1521960","1526960"," Oh, yes, we're going to at least expect some kind of a move down a retest to make sure that we'll rock a chip up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1526960","1532960"," Uh, this works too. Uh, but I'm telling you when you want that works in a, in a supportive environment."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1532960","1540960"," When we're in positive gamma, I would expect something like this. You retest and then the move higher and it to be supportive the entire way up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1540960","1550960"," But in negative gammy, when you start coming down here, it can be very risky, but I prefer to tee off the moving averages."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1551960","1557960"," Using this to move down to hit S one, right? Take profit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1557960","1566960"," Break through and then I'm not the resumption down to ask to break through, uh, pull back up and keep slamming those levels down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1566960","1568960"," Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1568960","1573960"," These yellow lines right here are going to be your previous lows. You guys want to see where your real previous lows are."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1573960","1575960"," If we start getting bearish."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1575960","1577960"," Um,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1583960","1589960"," Start getting bearish, man. You're talking about remember we're talking about this before. See this line right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1589960","1597960"," That's, that's pretty crazy right there, right? This is your first support 390 32."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1597960","1600960"," You can see where it is right here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1600960","1607960"," So this is your S one. This is your next previous low, right? And then beyond that, where's the next one? It's way down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1607960","1610960"," This is that gap that I was telling you about."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1610960","1616960"," And so when I'm telling you, yes, I was like, Hey, we got a lot, a lot of room to go down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1616960","1620960"," A ton of room, right? Your next previous support is way down there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1620960","1625960"," Um, so, so if you're a bear and you want to see."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1625960","1627960"," The destructive moves lower."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1627960","1633960"," You want this S one to break right here. I guess you got giant air gaps down here. Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1633960","1641960"," All right, just give me a second here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1641960","1649960"," Bears like I want to, I want bears like I just want to, I just want to sell off that shit. I want to, I want deep and low."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1649960","1654960"," So bears have some work down here. There is some support down. I've got two previous lows."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1654960","1662960"," Uh, S one is kind of like the, uh, we start selling down below S one. It's going to get ugly at any point. It'll get ugly down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1662960","1670960"," I do. I don't think we're going down. I think we've got, I think we've got minimum of, you know, today to go up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1670960","1675960"," Uh, one, two, three. And attempt to, if you guys were my bias, it's up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1675960","1678960"," So if anybody hasn't told you on Twitter or wherever."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1678960","1682960"," Facebook, Reddit, whatever, stock twits."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1683960","1688960"," Um, we're going to, we're going to either consolidate or move higher close gaps above."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1688960","1691960"," Three to six, 80."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1691960","1698960"," Two on my biases. I don't know if you guys care about my bias."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1698960","1701960"," Hold on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1701960","1708960"," What is going on?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1709960","1715960"," All right. There we go. There's S two."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1715960","1722960"," And then S three is three, 81. Look at how low this goes."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1722960","1725960"," This is the air gap."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1725960","1730960"," 3197."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1730960","1737960"," I'm going to warn you, I'm going to tell you right now. Okay. If you're a fucking bull, I'm going to tell you this right now. Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1737960","1741960"," You're a fucking bull and you don't think we can come down here and blast through."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1741960","1744960"," I warn you start breaking down below like S one and stuff."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1744960","1748960"," We grind through S one at any point. It's going to be fucking fast and furious down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1748960","1755960"," It's like it's on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1755960","1763960"," It's on. Do not be listening to any, any bull out there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1763960","1769960"," You're a bull. I want you to know we're back to this S one right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1769960","1773960"," It's kind of like you're."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1773960","1778960"," Start selling off down at any point, start seeing any kind of fucking nonsense like this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1778960","1782960"," Breaking down here and we start blasting through here. These levels are going to."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1782960","1786960"," They're like these levels down here are like, it's like a glass."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1786960","1790960"," You're like, we would say a glass floor right here. The moment this breaks."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1790960","1794960"," It's going to be. It should be super fast."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1794960","1797960"," I don't think we're going down here, to be honest with you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1797960","1800960"," I don't think you're going down here today. I think you're going to, if you're bearish,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1800960","1804960"," though, I think you're still going to see consolidation, then then you'll get that move down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1804960","1810960"," This could take one to three days to Friday. Maybe you might see a big sell off on Friday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1810960","1814960"," But you know, you can't understand."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1814960","1819960"," But if we stay below these movies, he's moving average, right? If we start staying below here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1819960","1825960"," It's going to get nasty. Right now we're not right now. We're consolidating. We just move up, coming back down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1825960","1830960"," Still make an decision on what we're doing for the day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1830960","1834960"," Hopefully you take profit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1834960","1838960"," Hopefully you heard me say take profit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1838960","1842960"," He had those zero dates. Hold on a second."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1842960","1849960"," What's going on there?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1849960","1856960"," You're going to have 15."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1856960","1860960"," This means nothing here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1860960","1863960"," S1 is 390."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1863960","1866960"," 32."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1866960","1880960"," You can see this channel is still working here. This is an important channel right here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1880960","1886960"," To be constructive for bulls if they can get above it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1886960","1894960"," Connect is like a temporary intraday support. More temporary intraday support for the move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1894960","1896960"," For bulls."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1896960","1903960"," T knot, place the T off of the bears, right? I'll extend this down for you this morning as well."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1903960","1905960"," So maybe we trade in here today."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1905960","1908960"," So we'll get that going for you too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1908960","1914960"," Don't hang tight here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1914960","1921960"," That's a vicious move down there. Insane."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1921960","1934960"," I'll actually open this up for you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1934960","1941960"," And you can see just off the just off the open. You can see that we're trading in here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1942960","1948960"," Tag it right back up bears right back in charge again."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1948960","1954960"," One, two, and three possibly consolidation from move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1954960","1961960"," Even possibly just trade in here today."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1961960","1963960"," See the bears taking charge in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1963960","1967960"," There's trying to maintain control here. Moving averages right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1967960","1976960"," There's like, nope, fuck you. Here's one. Here's two and we're going to start hitting lower."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1976960","1984960"," Retesting these lows right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1984960","1994960"," And and still have more salaries right now in the markets still if you look at the at the dome."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","1994960","2002960"," You can still see where my cursor is over. You still see more sellers than buyers at the moment."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2025960","2030960"," I think that works right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2030960","2039960"," Yeah, check one more thing real quick."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2039960","2045960"," Yes, that's up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2046960","2049960"," Hold on a second here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2049960","2053960"," Clean this up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2053960","2063960"," This is this yellow line right here, right? This is the."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2063960","2074960"," If there's still any bear or bulls out there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2074960","2082960"," I'll eat this one more time. Hold on a second here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2082960","2087960"," So if you are bullish."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2087960","2091960"," Hold on what happened there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2091960","2094960"," If you are bullish."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2094960","2096960"," Still bullish."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2096960","2101960"," You can't claim to be bullish until we break above here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2101960","2104960"," Do you want to see positive gamma?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2104960","2114960"," This is where I wrote previous channel. I could I could tell you this is positive gamma or zero gamma. You call it zero gamma to this will be in a attainable goal for bulls."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2114960","2126960"," I wrote previous channel, but this yellow line right here is pretty much going to be your positive gamma and zero gamma or above it is positive gamma above it is going to be."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2126960","2135960"," That's going to be high volatility in here. I want you to know that too high volatility here zero gamma positive gamma above negative gamma below."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2135960","2141960"," If bulls want to if we make if we make this trade higher here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2141960","2146960"," We'd make this trade higher tomorrow. We make this trade higher on Friday, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2146960","2151960"," You should expect vol in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2151960","2159960"," And you wouldn't take a a positive approach to the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2159960","2161960"," Until we're above it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2161960","2166960"," If you're a bull like cap bullish. This is where you get bullish up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2166960","2171960"," Until then you would see sell the rips until we get above this area right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2171960","2175960"," So any kind of pushes up. You'd expect to get sold off."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2175960","2178960"," You'd expect this to get sold off."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2178960","2185960"," You would expect to buy a dip above this area right here. Does that make sense? This is where we become supportive."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2185960","2191960"," This is when you would if we came above here and it came down, you would actually buy this dip."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2191960","2193960"," Or move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2193960","2194960"," Until then."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2194960","2196960"," The regime is bare."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2196960","2200960"," That would mean that if we come up here, you would sell that rip."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2200960","2203960"," If we come up here, you would sell that rip."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2203960","2208960"," I mean, if we come up here, you'd sell that rip. Does that make sense? If we come up here, you sell that rip."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2208960","2211960"," You guys understand the concepts I'm talking to you about?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2211960","2214960"," If you're looking to buy a dip."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2214960","2217960"," It's going to be above this yellow line."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2217960","2221960"," I brought a previous channel. I'm going to write zero gamma in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2221960","2227960"," So you can know what the difference is between positive and negative gamma environment."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2228960","2232960"," So I'll put zero gamma in."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2232960","2236960"," This will be a moving target."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2241960","2242960"," As we trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2242960","2247960"," You might have a different number from spot gamma. I'm telling you that's what it is right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2247960","2250960"," I promise you that this is your zero gamma."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2250960","2254960"," No matter what anyone's telling you, sell the rip until you get above there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2258960","2263960"," I'm here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2263960","2265960"," Where's that yellow line?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2265960","2268960"," It's not showing on this chart now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2268960","2271960"," It was there and now it's not."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2271960","2276960"," It's somewhere between R1 and R2, somewhere in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2276960","2281960"," Let me see if I can put it on a five minute chart and see where it's right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2281960","2285960"," Maybe I'll leave it on the five minute."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2285960","2288960"," You can actually just see it right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2316960","2324960"," Or do you guys prefer it on a one minute chart, maybe?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2324960","2329960"," I don't know what you prefer it on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2329960","2336960"," It's weird that it's not showing up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2336960","2341960"," You can actually evenly see where it's at."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2341960","2345960"," It's like 458 or something."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2345960","2349960"," You're going to be chasing it all day long."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2371960","2381960"," It's actually a nice trade right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2381960","2384960"," Already tagged the pivot point."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2384960","2386960"," We'll see if we can break above."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2386960","2387960"," Break above."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2387960","2394960"," Constructor for the bulls."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2394960","2395960"," Good morning."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2395960","2396960"," How are y'all doing?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2396960","2397960"," Yeah, one minute chart."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2397960","2402960"," No worries."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2402960","2404960"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2404960","2412960"," I can't believe you're all here this morning."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2412960","2414960"," Very constructive for the bulls."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2414960","2416960"," See how we're."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2416960","2417960"," Let the market open up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2417960","2420960"," You just get one touch right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2420960","2422960"," Two, three."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2422960","2426960"," I'd be targeting R1."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2426960","2429960"," It's 3.9816, at least 3.9816."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2456960","2481960"," Let's see if we can get this move higher here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2481960","2497960"," All of you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2497960","2500960"," Yeah, the 396s are now worth 63 cents."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2500960","2502960"," I think we bought them at 42."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2502960","2506960"," And then we wrote them up and then they came back down like 74."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2506960","2511960"," They're in the 90s for a minute, came back down like 85 than 74."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2511960","2515960"," They're now at 60 cents."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2515960","2521960"," The options markets sitting on 395 C."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2521960","2524960"," See here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2524960","2528960"," And there's some, there's a matter of fact, they just got out of them."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2528960","2533960"," There's an algal that just took off all that and they went to 390 P."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2534960","2539960"," They're trying to, they're trying to take us down here to at least right in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2539960","2543960"," Sometimes the puts will add rocket field market moving up though."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2543960","2550960"," So I'm not entirely sold on lower lows."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2550960","2554960"," I wouldn't always trust where the positioning is on the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2554960","2559960"," 396 is now 47 cents."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2559960","2562960"," Very key to watch these moving averages here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2562960","2571960"," Very key to let these moving averages pick a direction for the market for you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2571960","2575960"," Just back and forth sideways right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2575960","2579960"," Very key. So this whole area right here is very important for you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2579960","2581960"," Bull orbit doesn't matter."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2581960","2587960"," You want to pick a direction off of this or have some kind of a stop loss here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2587960","2589960"," Let's say, let's say a bullish right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2589960","2591960"," Let's just talk about being a bullish right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2591960","2598960"," So if you're a bullish right here, you're going to be looking for one, two, three, move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2598960","2600960"," If you're going to put, let's say you're going to buy some calls."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2600960","2603960"," You're going to say I'm going to cheapest calls I can possibly get."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2603960","2607960"," And I'm going to set some stops down here in case the trade goes against me."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2607960","2610960"," So you're looking for some kind of a break below here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2610960","2612960"," If you're a bull, say no, I'm going to pull the plug."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2612960","2614960"," I'm going to start buying some puts."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2614960","2616960"," Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2616960","2619960"," So as an example."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2619960","2625960"," Uh, and what would it be that the, where would you expect us to go today?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2625960","2626960"," If you're bullish."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2626960","2629960"," So you start thinking, you're just going to start your trading plan, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2629960","2630960"," Like I'm bullish cap."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2630960","2634960"," You know that zero gas is somewhere somewhere up in here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2634960","2639960"," So your target on day probably three ninety eight."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2639960","2642960"," You're going to take a more of an in the money type call."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2642960","2644960"," So three ninety fives, maybe."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2644960","2647960"," You're going to have a stop somewhere down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2647960","2649960"," You already know you have, you already have a low down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2649960","2651960"," Um, so on, on a low."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2651960","2654960"," We're looking to grab some three ninety fives, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2654960","2655960"," To run them up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2655960","2657960"," Maybe possibly three ninety sixes."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2657960","2659960"," So they were cheap here for a minute."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2659960","2660960"," They were like forty cents."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2660960","2662960"," Now they have fifty seven cents."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2662960","2668960"," Um, so one of these lows right here you will, you'll end up doing is you'll buy them for as cheap as you can possibly get them."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2668960","2670960"," They were forty cents here for a minute."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2671960","2672960"," See that right here?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2672960","2673960"," One."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2675960","2676960"," One."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2676960","2677960"," Two."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2677960","2678960"," And three."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2678960","2681960"," And this should be an explosive move here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2681960","2683960"," This should be a giant move."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2683960","2685960"," You should see some kind of a move."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2687960","2691960"," On your first place to take profits going to be three ninety five thirteen blue or not."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2691960","2693960"," You'll see a move here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2693960","2695960"," You'll see consolidation."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2695960","2699960"," You'll snap a line right here and then you're going to see a move."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2699960","2700960"," Right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2701960","2702960"," You got me."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2706960","2712960"," And so we'll watch how this plays out, but you should be thinking your entire trade through looking for these moves."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2712960","2714960"," Looking for the move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2714960","2718960"," If directionally, when you're thinking this stuff out, you should be."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2718960","2721960"," Uh, pre planning what you're doing here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2721960","2722960"," Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2723960","2728960"," Uh, if you're pre planning where the market's going right here and that doesn't go the way that you planned it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2729960","2732960"," There's some fucked up in your planning. Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2734960","2736960"," You should be always you should be."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2737960","2742960"," If you can't do this, if you can't do this, um, just in a thought process."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2742960","2744960"," You shouldn't be trading with real money."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2744960","2750960"," You should you should directionally have have a plan of what you're doing and where we're going before it happens."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2750960","2752960"," There should not be any guesswork."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2752960","2755960"," There should be no guesswork in what you're doing."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2755960","2757960"," I don't know if that that process is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2758960","2761960"," So if you're asking yourself most days, I don't know where we're going."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2761960","2762960"," I don't know what's happening."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2762960","2763960"," I don't know what's up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2763960","2764960"," You shouldn't be trading."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2764960","2765960"," You know what I mean?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2765960","2768960"," You should be just the thought process."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2768960","2770960"," Watch where the market goes after your thought process."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2770960","2772960"," And see if that works out for you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2772960","2775960"," If it doesn't work out for you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2775960","2777960"," Uh, you've got more work to do, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2777960","2781960"," You've got more more to learn to pick a directional bias."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2781960","2786960"," Um, this is, this is also oftentimes."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2786960","2795960"," Um, where if you believe in the trend of, or you believe in your, if you believe in your positioning and what we're going."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2795960","2798960"," You know, let's say you have a small rip down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2798960","2801960"," And you, your directional bias is right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2801960","2804960"," I could take all day long, could take half a day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2804960","2808960"," Um, you want to always make sure that positioning though is correct, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2808960","2814960"," Uh, or if you have this quick tip down that you'll buy your position, you'll add to maybe add to your position and have even a lower."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2814960","2823960"," Um, maybe even lower your, um, stop losses so that you can build this is where this is where you add and continue on with your, um, your thesis."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2823960","2825960"," And when does your thesis break?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2825960","2829960"," Uh, you know, you can kind of see it right here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2829960","2839960"," If you get us quick snap down and bounces back up, you're like, Hey, my thesis is safe and good to go."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2840960","2849960"," And the more you do this, the more you're going to be confident in your thesis and you're like, well, what, what is my thesis change?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2849960","2854960"," Uh, the minute we start."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2854960","2855960"," Uh, resisting."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2855960","2857960"," We find some resistance."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2857960","2858960"," Fine."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2858960","2859960"," Let's sort of trade this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2859960","2861960"," Start seeing this move lower, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2861960","2867960"," You can then change your thesis and say, well, my thesis is a sound and it's just, it's not going the direction that I want to go in."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2867960","2869960"," As soon as you start seeing moves like this down below."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2869960","2872960"," I know some of you out there are like, nope, I'm going to fucking diamond hand calls."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2872960","2879960"," You know, if you, if your thesis is sound and the market still reverses and goes the other way, you cut your losses down here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2879960","2884960"," So we put a stop boss and say, nope, my thesis is what the sound, uh, but it didn't happen, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2884960","2892960"," Cut your losses and then, and then trade this, this direction will move lower."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2893960","2896960"," Drop a knowledge this morning."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2904960","2908960"," Yeah, let's look at, you guys want to look at TLT real quick. Let's talk about TLT."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2912960","2914960"," Uh, no, I don't think it's done."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2914960","2916960"," Uh, TLT is a."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2916960","2920960"," TLT is like."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2921960","2923960"," Trading the DIA."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2923960","2931960"," It will fucking, it moves, but you're, if you take a position in DIA, if you take a position in TLT."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2933960","2935960"," It's a, it's a waiting game."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2937960","2941960"," It's a, it's very similar to oil oil stocks, especially energy stocks."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2942960","2947960"," You're going to need to be awake at like four o'clock in the morning. Take your profit and then you reenter that trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2948960","2956960"," Some people like to trade like 10, 30 oil and gas news, but this is somewhat if you trade TLT, just like energy stocks."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2957960","2959960"," It's going to, um."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2962960","2966960"," It's a, it's a patience game. It's a long ass trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2967960","2969960"," So here we have."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2970960","2975960"," Keep clicking the wrong one here. Okay, so."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2977960","2980960"," Do you take profit here? Absofucking Lutely."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2982960","2987960"," But I want you to see this over, over a long, I want to see, I want you to see this over a long period of time. Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2989960","2994960"," I mean, you're talking about, let's say you take a position here. It's one, two, three, four days."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2995960","2998960"," Right. And let's say like, oh, I want to reenter that trade long, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","2999960","3008960"," Let's see. Just trade in the trend. You could be waiting. How long? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine for that trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3008960","3010960"," Just just to reenter it again."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3011960","3020960"," Uh, these are trades that typically take time. Uh, yeah. And again, right? You've got a move higher, right? Move lower. It's like a three day move right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3021960","3035960"," One, two, three day higher, three days down. Was it three or four, five days consolidation move, break back down. And then it just keeps pumping. So whenever I trade, whatever, I haven't traded TLT in a while, but whenever I have traded TLT."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3037960","3044960"," Talking about placing a position and coming back and check on it. Um, we'll take a look at some stuff here. We'll actually look at TLT over."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3045960","3051960"," This is like TLT trends for TLT trends for like."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3052960","3056960"," It's like, it's an epic trend. I don't know if you call it like an epic trender."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3057960","3062960"," Um, you see this directional move. How long this lasted? This is like 2018."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3063960","3064960"," The 2020."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3065960","3069960"," This direction will move down on TLT. We just look at how long it lasted."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3070960","3076960"," Um, and I've got a, um, just the amount of time that it took, it traded in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3078960","3083960"," So if, if you're a bull on TLT."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3086960","3090960"," See right here, right? Uh, we're coming into major resistance up here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3090960","3091960"," On TLT."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3097960","3098960"," This bull trend here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3100960","3104960"," And I think the question, I think he was asking, do you take profit? Fuck. Yeah, you take profit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3105960","3107960"," Even a bunch of gaps below down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3109960","3114960"," Um, you're gonna, you're gonna expect even, even if the sellers a week, you're gonna expect sellers to come in, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3116960","3118960"," You're gonna expect sellers to come in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3119960","3124960"," Um, this, I would assume there's standing orders of sellers above here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3126960","3130960"," So we're gonna do is, um."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3135960","3138960"," We know there are sellers there, sellers are 100%."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3139960","3141960"," Perfect place to sell TLT."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3143960","3144960"," 110."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3145960","3148960"," You're gonna expect, you're gonna expect, it doesn't matter if it breaks above."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3148960","3150960"," You're gonna expect sellers right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3151960","3152960"," Hands down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3153960","3154960"," Promise you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3155960","3156960"," It's at 108.93."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3159960","3164960"," I bet bulls are just sitting up or bears are sitting up here going, we're gonna smash the fuck out of this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3166960","3167960"," Uh, so."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3167960","3171960"," And you've got, uh, some sellers sold down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3175960","3195960"," Yeah, they pushed up here, pushing up one more time, you're gonna expect sellers to come in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3198960","3199960"," Excuse me."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3201960","3203960"," And see how it's playing out right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3205960","3211960"," So you're gonna expect these sellers to come in here and just start selling this down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3211960","3212960"," Where does it roll over?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3212960","3213960"," Where do you find support?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3213960","3215960"," I guess it would be the next question."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3216960","3218960"," And, uh, you're gonna be looking right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3225960","3226960"," Push higher, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3227960","3228960"," Push higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3228960","3231960"," It's gonna be without even, I'm not even fucking looking at anything."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3231960","3234960"," I'll just tell you right now, it's gonna be."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3236960","3237960"," This is your S one."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3242960","3246960"," On a real time frame, like on this, where you buy it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3249960","3250960"," First place is down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3253960","3255960"," Push, push, zest to."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3262960","3264960"," We could draw like a."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3267960","3270960"," A yellow and a green bar in here in your own charting software."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3270960","3272960"," And this is where the real support is right down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3275960","3276960"," Somewhere down in there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3279960","3281960"," It's kind of like your S three down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3285960","3286960"," Where do you enter this trade?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3286960","3287960"," Down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3288960","3290960"," That's where you enter this trade down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3293960","3294960"," You're gonna expect consolidation."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3294960","3299960"," You're gonna expect the sellers to come in and you'll be looking for some kind of consolidation."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3300960","3301960"," You already see the trend, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3303960","3305960"," And hopefully another attack above here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3307960","3311960"," And maybe a moment where it slips down for another move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3312960","3315960"," Safest place to buy, 105, 102."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3320960","3325960"," Where do you start getting really bullish on TLT is breaking this right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3325960","3327960"," Break out of this trend."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3327960","3329960"," Shit is on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3333960","3334960"," Shit is on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3334960","3340960"," I mean, you're talking about, talking about targets above right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3342960","3345960"," Next target above right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3345960","3347960"," Big giant moves."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3347960","3349960"," Giant fucking trend moves."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3349960","3350960"," It's next year."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3356960","3357960"," Sold it down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3357960","3359960"," Oh, they sold it down there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3360960","3361960"," Oh, I'm here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3367960","3368960"," Right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3369960","3373960"," If we start trending bullish, it's like catching us a knife, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3377960","3380960"," I hate catching knives somewhere in there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3383960","3385960"," What would you expect over it?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3385960","3386960"," Oh, let's call it a year."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3386960","3387960"," All right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3387960","3388960"," So I've got this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3388960","3390960"," So I've got a, I've got a algorithm for this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3392960","3394960"," I'm not going to show it to you right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3395960","3399960"," Because it's a, it has to prove itself."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3399960","3401960"," When you're catching fallen knives like TLT,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3405960","3408960"," you're looking for a constructive,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3408960","3411960"," looking for a constructive move."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3411960","3414960"," The real, the real training, there's a trade in here for TLT."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3415960","3419960"," But if you want to get bullish on TLT, it's not showing itself yet."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3419960","3420960"," It needs to break this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3420960","3422960"," It has to break the downtrend."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3424960","3427960"," It needs probably some large ass consolidation in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3427960","3429960"," This is March down here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3430960","3432960"," And you would want to pick it up again."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3433960","3437960"," You could, you could buy the bottoms down here as it's becoming constructive."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3437960","3440960"," If it's becoming constructive and then sell the rips."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3441960","3446960"," And then you would read, actually retake this long for the rest of 2023, 2023."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3446960","3449960"," If we go into some form of stag, stagflation."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3451960","3453960"," You would see something like this over the course of the year."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3455960","3457960"," A lot of work to do in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3458960","3459960"," Very complicated work."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3460960","3463960"," You'd be looking for, you'd be looking to buy these lows down here at S3."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3465960","3467960"," This is a failure at any point down at real failure."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3467960","3469960"," Get out of that trade completely."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3472960","3474960"," A lot of work to do in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3475960","3477960"," Does that help for, does that help help you guys?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3478960","3480960"," This is a patience trade too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3481960","3483960"," This could take you like a week, a month,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3483960","3485960"," sometimes to get down here to like one or two."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3486960","3494960"," But I almost, I'm not guaranteeing this, but almost positively sure that you will get opportunities to buy on lows over here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3495960","3496960"," Usually you will."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3503960","3504960"," I've got a big patience trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3508960","3509960"," It's all constructive here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3510960","3513960"," Both, both dudes are in charge right now, if you don't notice."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3513960","3515960"," Right now at this moment there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3517960","3518960"," This is nice."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3519960","3521960"," Opening bar, took the money and ran right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3522960","3524960"," Letting the day open up, seeing, letting it open up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3524960","3528960"," You have one, two, boom, higher, three, boom, higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3530960","3534960"," intraday traders just trying to buy these dips, pump these things up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3535960","3537960"," Don't get caught in a trap here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3538960","3545960"," There's a little bit of a, um, bearish, bearish, bearish trying to sell this down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3551960","3557960"," Like scumbag fucking, this is like, this is like straight up scumbag, uh, boil room shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3563960","3564960"," Excuse me."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3567960","3568960"," Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3577960","3578960"," One minute traders."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3585960","3586960"," This is nice."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3588960","3589960"," For a huge move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3590960","3591960"," We buying that right there all day long."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3591960","3592960"," This is very bullish, by the way."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3593960","3596960"," I don't know if you know that, but it's pretty, pretty fucking bullish right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3597960","3602960"," You know, you, you know, you're, you're, you're, I think you're expecting this to be like a bearish sign, but it's not as very bullish."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3606960","3607960"," Just try it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3607960","3608960"," Just trying to gain."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3609960","3611960"," It's a very bullish move right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3615960","3616960"," And some of you guys like that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3616960","3617960"," That's a bear flag cap."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3617960","3618960"," That's not a bear flag."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3619960","3622960"," Consolidation for a rip fucking rip higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3626960","3630960"," You should see a giant move here fucking giant move."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3631960","3633960"," This is going to be a great trade right here higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3643960","3645960"," You're going to see it blast the fuck off here in a minute."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3649960","3655960"," Get your fucking space helmets on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3666960","3670960"," I know he's watched his previous eyes here right rejected off three, three and eighty five before."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3671960","3679960"," You want to see a break above this three, ninety five, uh, thirty."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3694960","3695960"," What are you guys saying about it?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3695960","3699960"," I'm going to tell T go and pull back with the next hike now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3699960","3704960"," Yeah, I want you guys to, so Sam, Sam Hansel Hunter is asking a question."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3704960","3707960"," And I'm going to give you an as a."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3709960","3711960"," As a trader."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3711960","3713960"," And as an investor."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3713960","3716960"," You can easily and often."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3718960","3724960"," Get caught in watching the macro news, the economic news, the if this happens,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3724960","3725960"," then that happens."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3725960","3730960"," It's very important for you as a trader, especially an equity trader to."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3731960","3732960"," Uh, not."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3734960","3736960"," Uh, put too much bias or wait until that stuff."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3737960","3740960"," It's more like theater for you as a trader."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3741960","3742960"," You know, it's good."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3742960","3743960"," It's good for shits and giggles."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3744960","3746960"," I'll be honest with you on on different timeframes."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3747960","3748960"," I don't fucking care."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3749960","3750960"," What the news is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3751960","3753960"," I don't fucking care what the events are."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3754960","3757960"," I don't fucking care what the smartest guy in the room is telling me."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3758960","3759960"," I could give a shit less."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3760960","3761960"," Nine times out of 10."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3763960","3764960"," What people are trying to tell me."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3765960","3766960"," I don't fucking care."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3767960","3773960"," There's there's normal accumulation of the things that I do care about are like fraud."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3774960","3776960"," In it within a company, maybe, or they're stuck."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3776960","3778960"," I care about, um."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3779960","3781960"," I don't know what to say what I care."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3781960","3782960"," It's not."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3782960","3787960"," There's not a lot that I care about the most that mostly I care about."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3788960","3792960"," Um, accumulation and distribution of a stock on any given timeline."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3793960","3797960"," So if I'm looking at a day, if I'm looking at five days, if I'm looking on a month,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3797960","3799960"," I'm looking at five years or a year."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3800960","3802960"," In general, that's all I'm looking at."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3804960","3806960"," Uh, we have a stock market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3806960","3807960"," That's what we have."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3808960","3810960"," And, uh, I got to book somewhere."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3810960","3811960"," I'm going to grab."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3812960","3813960"," My back."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3813960","3830960"," One of these days, we should do like a, a zoom call where we just talk about the normalcy of, um, of the rise and fall of a given share stock and that it doesn't really give a flying fuck about."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3830960","3831960"," There are, there are some."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3831960","3832960"," There are those moments, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3832960","3836960"," Fraud, uh, war, uh, black swan type events."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3836960","3838960"," You can't really account for those things."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3838960","3843960"," Uh, maybe the life of a company."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3843960","3847960"," And that you'll see like a trajectory of a company, they're a new company."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3847960","3860960"," And then you find out that they're not, you know, like the meteoric meteoric rise to 300 bucks and they go back down to like $3 and stay there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3861960","3862960"," Those kinds of things are important."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3862960","3864960"," Pe ratios are important."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3864960","3865960"," That kind of stuff is all important."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3865960","3873960"," Uh, like some fundamental analysis to a point, but I'm telling you, like generally speaking, uh, we have a stock market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3873960","3876960"," We have, we have stocks that are accumulated."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3877960","3881960"," And then they're just, and then they're sold for profit, but that's the truth."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3882960","3886960"," Uh, you will do better as a, as an investor and a stock trader."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3887960","3890960"," Sometimes I'll say, oh, sometimes on stream, I'll say that it's, um."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3890960","3895960"," It's like a sociopathic look out, look out or outlook on the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3895960","3897960"," You like, I love Tesla."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3897960","3901960"," I used to go down the test the whole, but I made so much more money."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3901960","3903960"," As a Tesla investor."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3903960","3908960"," When I've become, um, I've had more of a, more of a standoffish look."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3908960","3910960"," A Tesla objective."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3910960","3912960"," You can call it an objective analysis, I guess."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3913960","3915960"," And you should too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3917960","3921960"," You should, if you want to be successful, you can have like two hats, three hats."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3921960","3925960"," You can have a Captain Jim on Main Street hat."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3925960","3927960"," You can have a Captain Jim political hat."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3927960","3931960"," You can have a Captain Jim, um, I just like this company hat."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3931960","3933960"," I can have a Captain Jim."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3933960","3934960"," I hate this company hat."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3934960","3936960"," Then you have to have this one hat."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3936960","3937960"," For you making money."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3937960","3938960"," I want you to out there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3938960","3939960"," If you're listening right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3939960","3940960"," Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3941960","3951960"," The, your only goal at goal at all times, no matter what you say, no matter what you think, no matter what, um, macro news comes out, you can have that hat, you can wear that hat."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3951960","3953960"," But when you're here making money."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3953960","3955960"," The only hat that matters."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3955960","3959960"," Is that is the money that you withdraw from the market and put in your pocket."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3959960","3961960"," I don't care."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3961960","3963960"," I don't care at all."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3963960","3969960"," Um,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3970960","3973960"," How the market moves. I don't care if the spy goes to zero."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3973960","3976960"," I don't care if the spy goes to a thousand."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3976960","3978960"," I do, right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3978960","3984960"," And when one hat I do, but on the other hat, the only thing I care about is that money in my pocket. So."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3984960","3988960"," When I'm done here with you right every day and you're done here with me every day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3988960","3994960"," The only thing that should ever matter to you is that you drew money out of the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","3994960","3996960"," I'm not going to be there with you later tonight."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","4005960","4012960"," And I'll tell you like that, that, that angst or insecurity or that, um, anger or excitement or happiness."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4012960","4013960"," All that stuff doesn't matter."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4013960","4017960"," What really matters is that once you leave, you know that money is in your pocket."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4017960","4022960"," That feeling of security afterwards, after all the bullshit in the market all day long is all that matters."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4023960","4024960"," Keep that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4024960","4026960"," Always keep that in the back of your mind."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4026960","4032960"," Um, the importance of, uh, of that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4032960","4033960"," Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4033960","4037960"," Don't get wrapped up in the social media stuff. Get wrapped up in the, keeping the money in my pocket."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4037960","4039960"," I want that money in my pocket."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4039960","4041960"," Matters above all else."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4041960","4045960"," And apply that apply that to your trade and apply that to, um."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4045960","4051960"," Uh, I guess your bias, your ultimate bias."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4052960","4055960"," Right. So if my bias is bearish right now and we start trading up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4055960","4059960"," If I keep that bearish and just in a day, not five days, not a month, just today."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4059960","4062960"," Let's say it's like right now I'm bearish."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4062960","4065960"," For the day and the market starts going up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4065960","4067960"," You need to trade that market up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4067960","4070960"," You can't be like, Oh, well, I'm fucking bearish here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4070960","4072960"," The market just keeps grinding higher."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","4085960","4089960"," Positive on the day, no matter what, does it make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4089960","4097960"," That's the second rejection above here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4097960","4100960"," Uh, so this is not good."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4100960","4101960"," I don't like seeing that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4101960","4103960"," I don't like seeing that sell here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4103960","4106960"," I don't fucking like seeing that sell either right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4107960","4110960"," And just the fucking bears sitting up here trying to sell it down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4110960","4114960"," God damn bears."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","4126960","4127960"," Yeah, read your book."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4127960","4128960"," Yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4128960","4131960"," I've got a book on my shelf."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4131960","4135960"," That talks about it in depth so that you can see the normal."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4136960","4151960"," Heaven flow of stock pricing."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4151960","4152960"," Look at that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4152960","4153960"," Just trading in the day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4153960","4155960"," Trade in the day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4155960","4157960"," Still sitting still positive right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4157960","4158960"," Just, you know, it's all positive."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4158960","4160960"," I don't like the selling right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4160960","4163960"," I don't think that's selling right there, but still positive still."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4164960","4165960"," Just trade enough."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4165960","4166960"," Be what right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4166960","4168960"," If, uh,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4168960","4172960"," This is more constructive for the bulls right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4172960","4173960"," Uh,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4173960","4177960"," So if you want to know what I've got for opinion of where we are right now,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4177960","4179960"," you've got two rejections above."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4179960","4182960"," Uh, if you start saying more rejections."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4182960","4184960"," Like one, two."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4184960","4186960"," Um, the bulls can't."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4186960","4187960"," We're not in trend day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4187960","4189960"," I promise you that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4189960","4190960"," This isn't trend or it's not."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4190960","4192960"," We're not in trend mode right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4192960","4194960"," We're in consolidation mode."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4194960","4196960"," This is right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4196960","4199960"," Um,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4199960","4202960"," We are holding."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4202960","4203960"," Right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4203960","4204960"," See, we're holding here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4204960","4205960"," We're holding here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4205960","4207960"," Holding here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4207960","4210960"," Uh, if we can't break through like the third time here,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4210960","4212960"," we are going to head lower."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4212960","4214960"," You only get, you only get so many chances at it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4214960","4217960"," You don't get like five chances to go up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4217960","4220960"," Uh,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4220960","4221960"," Point to know that too, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4221960","4224960"," If you see sellers here, sellers here, we're going to look for some."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4224960","4229960"," For some more or better, uh, demand down below four."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4229960","4230960"," Uh, push higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4230960","4233960"," So you might see some weakness here for a moment."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4233960","4236960"," Uh, you'll be using a book map to look for that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4236960","4238960"," I'll put my bike up for you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4238960","4243960"," And where's that low?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4243960","4246960"," That's 3900, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4247960","4251960"," So you'd be looking for some point at some for some weakness down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4251960","4254960"," 3900 is, uh, somewhere in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4254960","4257960"," So you might see a moment where you dip lower."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4257960","4259960"," Looking for some demand."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4259960","4261960"," So we can make it to the next level."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4261960","4262960"," Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4262960","4267960"," Well, I can't see that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4267960","4268960"," I want you to see this right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4268960","4269960"," Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4269960","4270960"," So."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4271960","4272960"," Sorry."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4272960","4273960"," Attempt to go higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4273960","4274960"," We had told no, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4274960","4276960"," Consolidation looking for buyers, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4276960","4277960"," Next move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4277960","4279960"," And we were told, nope, you got, nope."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4279960","4280960"," Sorry, buddy."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4280960","4282960"," Not enough demand yet."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4282960","4284960"," So what you'll sometimes see is this move lower."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4284960","4292960"," Looking for buyers."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4292960","4294960"," If the buyers wind up being here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4294960","4295960"," I'm going to go along."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4295960","4299960"," I'm going to wait for the cheap money, smart money to call it, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4300960","4302960"," For another attempt higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4302960","4312960"," If you get some FOMO people here, uh, they will make it to the next level."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4312960","4314960"," Makes sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4314960","4320960"," Because we already tried once, we tried twice."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4320960","4323960"," Not finding the buyers we want."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4323960","4328960"," So if you're like a cheap ass like me, uh, you're going to be, you're going to be like this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4328960","4332960"," You're going to be in the background going, please sell off."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4332960","4335960"," So that I can buy down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4335960","4337960"," That's what you're going to tell yourself."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4337960","4339960"," Please, please, please, please, please, please."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4339960","4340960"," Come down to where I am."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4340960","4342960"," I've got a standing order here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4342960","4344960"," I'll pay $390."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4344960","4351960"," And, uh, hopefully you'll come see me down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4351960","4354960"," You'll now be trapped in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4355960","4358960"," And you'll have to actually add to your position down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4358960","4363960"," And you'll, you'll rocket me up so that I can make money here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4363960","4365960"," It's terrible."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4365960","4369960"," It doesn't always happen, but, uh, sometimes it does."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4369960","4373960"," There's no guarantee that happens, but as a trader, that's what I'm always looking for."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4373960","4376960"," I'm always looking for that one cheap ass."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4376960","4382960"," Last, last, uh, liquidity grab down here for the move to the next level."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4383960","4386960"," It doesn't always work out, but that's what I'm doing in my brain."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4386960","4388960"," I want you to know what I'm doing."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4394960","4395960"," That's how my brain thinks."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4395960","4396960"," Give me cheap fucking shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4396960","4398960"," Give me like 30 cent calls."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4407960","4408960"," Isn't that crazy?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4413960","4414960"," All right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4414960","4416960"," Uh, so I'm going to take a break here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4416960","4420960"," I'm going to rest my voice and leave this, uh, chat or the chat stand chat."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4420960","4423960"," Um, talk amongst each other and yourselves."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4423960","4425960"," I need to take a break on my, my vocal cords."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4425960","4428960"," The smart vocal cords are really, really, uh, sore."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4430960","4434960"," Uh, even if we were to trade lower here for some liquidity down below."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4434960","4435960"," Still bullish."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4435960","4438960"," We're, we're, this is a consolidation for move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4439960","4441960"," Uh, even this rejection is somewhat bullish."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4441960","4444960"," I would prefer to buy some calls."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4445960","4446960"," Somewhere down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4447960","4448960"," That's where I want to buy them."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4448960","4451960"," I don't think I'll get them, but if I have the chance, if there's a chance"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4451960","4454960"," to buy some calls down here, I take that all day long."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4460960","4461960"," I'll be right back."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4468960","4469960"," Thank you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4498960","4500960"," Thank you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4528960","4530960"," Thank you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4558960","4560960"," Thank you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4588960","4590960"," Thank you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4618960","4620960"," Thank you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4648960","4649960"," Thank you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4649960","4650960"," Thank you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4650960","4651960"," Thank you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4651960","4672960"," Thank you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4673960","4676960"," I posted a question to the chat."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4676960","4679960"," Do we trade to R1 or S1 first?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4679960","4683960"," Um, my vote is for R1, but, uh, place your votes."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4683960","4686960"," If you can, so you can help your fellow traders out."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4686960","4704960"," So again, so it says the SEC is enforcing rules on crypto companies."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4717960","4724960"," And if you're, if you're tuning in this broadcast, don't hesitate to talk to your fellow traders."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4724960","4727960"," Say you got, you're looking to buy a dip on S1 or you're looking to just."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4727960","4728960"," I'm long."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4728960","4730960"," You can say I'm long right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4730960","4735960"," For R1 or I'm waiting in the background for consolidation for, for a dip to buy."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4735960","4740960"," I think I saw them non fatales in here and she said, um."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4740960","4743960"," Took that TLT short off the level cap."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4743960","4744960"," Thanks for the heads up on it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4745960","4746960"," Yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4746960","4750960"," So you guys, um, uh, talk."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4750960","4752960"," You guys want to talk to each other?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4752960","4754960"," If you're listening to this, this stream right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4754960","4757960"," Don't hesitate to be like, Hey, I want to take this trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4757960","4759960"," What do you guys think of it?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4759960","4761960"," Our, our group of people, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4761960","4763960"," Our traders are not here to make fun of you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4763960","4766960"," If I can, oh, you can link in just as one thing."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4766960","4771960"," Uh, but if I ever see like, if I ever see someone being like, I don't know, you're."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4772960","4774960"," Uh, just ripping on people for ripping on people."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4774960","4775960"," I'll tell you to go fuck yourself."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4775960","4776960"," But everyone's here to learn."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4776960","4777960"," Everyone's here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4777960","4778960"," Uh, not everyone."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4778960","4779960"," People here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4779960","4783960"," The FCC to vote on the equity market proposal on December the 14th."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4783960","4786960"," Uh, there's some really serious traders here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4786960","4790960"," A lot of traders with a lot of experience, uh, that have a lot of knowledge."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4790960","4792960"," They're going to help you along."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4792960","4798960"," If you're a new trader and you have a simple, you have the question that should wait for after market hours, save it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4798960","4800960"," Uh, but if you're considering a trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4801960","4804960"," Why would you not ask to see what people think of your trade?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4804960","4809960"," Why would you risk $1,000 and not say, hey, I'm thinking about taking this trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4809960","4810960"," What do you think?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4810960","4814960"," Uh, at least here what they have to say on that trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4814960","4815960"," Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4815960","4819960"," I started making another move higher as a third attempt."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4819960","4823960"," If this attempt fails, uh, I would take a bearish."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4824960","4829960"," Stance here, but, uh, don't hesitate to be like, hey, I want to take this or I'm going to take that or."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","4871960","4875960"," If you only see like one, but so if you see like one, 2.8 million dollar put."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4875960","4877960"," That's more than likely a hedge."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4877960","4879960"," Uh, on its own."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4879960","4880960"," That'd be really wary."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4880960","4883960"," I mean, I have no, no offense to cheddar flow either."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4883960","4890960"," Um, or any of the flow services, but, uh, they don't always interpret what's, what it is that's coming out."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4890960","4894960"," If you see just like a 1, 2 million dollar put, a 3 million dollar put."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4894960","4896960"," You don't see corresponding flow with it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4896960","4902960"," It's normally, uh, a position bullish in the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4911960","4912960"," Yeah, you're right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4912960","4914960"," It's like hedge bingo."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","4981960","4983960"," Trying to get above that point."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4983960","4990960"," Just trying to get above that point so you can make it run to our 1, aren't they?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4990960","4991960"," Look at that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","4991960","4993960"," Look at those dirty fucking bulls."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","5150960","5152960"," All right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5180960","5182960"," All right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5240960","5242960"," All right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5270960","5272960"," You"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5330960","5342960"," We're going to do one more thing here I know there are bears here that want to position for another short so we're going to talk about that right now we're quick for just a moment."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5342960","5350960"," Just briefly if you're looking for a target above here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5351960","5357960"," We're coming into some resistance here you see this resistance here and how it matches up to book map."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5357960","5361960"," You take your money here and re-enter above."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5361960","5368960"," So if you're a bull I don't know how many guys have been with you for how long but so here's a nice trade higher right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5368960","5373960"," You're going to see a consolidation or rejection phase one or the other."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5374960","5379960"," And then of the leg higher so if you're trading level to level."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5379960","5383960"," You be taking your money here and looking to re-enter."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5383960","5390960"," So you'll be looking for a if you're at home and you're you've got a chart open or something."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5390960","5398960"," You can see that that orange bar right there right so when I trade what I do is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5403960","5407960"," Do something like this right just put a little red box right here if you wanted."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5407960","5413960"," If you did didn't want to what you could do sometimes I'll just draw."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5413960","5420960"," Just a simple consolidation line see if this consolidates or it breaks."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5420960","5428960"," I'm looking to see what happens."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5428960","5436960"," And I'd be looking to re-enter again because what they'll do is they'll grind your options down and you want to be you'll more than likely see something like this and move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5436960","5444960"," If we take too much time here we'll go back down again right we'll look for a grab off of these moving averages right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5444960","5453960"," So you'll be looking for one of two things either distribution down to get more support."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5453960","5461960"," If the consolidation is is is a very small amount of time you will see a quick move up higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5461960","5467960"," I don't know what your positioning is if you're taking like calls that are weak out there you won't have as much grind on them."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5467960","5470960"," If you're in zero dates or one dates you'll see more grind on them."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5470960","5477960"," If you watch options change you'll see that happen right you might have an option that cost you fifty cents goes to seventy five cents."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5477960","5482960"," Comes back down to even sometimes forty cents depending on the amount of time that takes place."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5482960","5490960"," So you'd like in directionally get out in directionally get out."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5490960","5495960"," That makes sense in directionally get out SPX if you guys are trading SPX."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5495960","5501960"," Or I want you guys to know there's a tax advantage is trading SPX and also."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5502960","5507960"," They're not as volatile as spy options."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5507960","5514960"," So if any of you guys want less volatility you could buy either father dated by contracts."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5514960","5518960"," Or you could trade SPX."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5518960","5533960"," I'll leave this up for a minute because I know you guys want to be you guys are trying to watch this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5549960","5555960"," Well man I'll tell you what we're still in a solar rip environment want to be careful be careful up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5555960","5564960"," I mean there is a three nine seven two fifty."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5568960","5572960"," Somewhere in here maybe a target up in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5573960","5580960"," It's not too much higher three and seven two fifty is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5580960","5585960"," Somewhere up in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5586960","5595960"," Three eight six fifty three and seven two fifty."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5595960","5598960"," It's it's lower."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5598960","5600960"," Hold on here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5600960","5603960"," Not too much higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5603960","5610960"," Just be careful up here there could be some bulls or some this could be a bull trap."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5611960","5615960"," There's not a lot above here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5615960","5621960"," Is not so I want you if you guys are looking at."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5621960","5625960"," Book map book maps not showing like a target above here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5625960","5631960"," It could we could step up and grind higher just for better positioning but I have a feeling that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5631960","5639960"," There's some fucking bears up here waiting to sell it down somewhere in this area pair."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5640960","5644960"," There's some going on up here we could step up the whole entire way just be careful."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5644960","5649960"," We are in a solar environment so if we rip up higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5649960","5653960"," You ever hear about selling in a string when you're."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5653960","5662960"," So we're in a negative environment right if we rip up higher it'll immediately be sold back down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5662960","5666960"," Just be careful as we as we trade up in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5667960","5669960"," It'll look supportive."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5669960","5671960"," Structure will be sound and."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5671960","5675960"," So everything here looks supportive and everything here looks bullish."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5675960","5679960"," I'd be wary of bears trying to."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5679960","5684960"," Set your your bowl ass up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5684960","5688960"," I would have tight stops in this trade higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5688960","5690960"," So if you're long as a bull."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","5691960","5693960"," For this move higher."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","6148960","6150960"," Are you bearish or bullish here?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6150960","6153960"," Like truly are you bullish and bearish?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6153960","6156960"," I was trying to relate to him."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6156960","6159960"," The only bull case left."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6159960","6173960"," Or if you were if you were to have a bull case here and they don't do a sector rotation and start blasting this market down slowly once they have supply."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6173960","6175960"," It was a month chart right here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6175960","6182960"," If you want to get bullish, you need to first reclaim all this right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6182960","6185960"," You can get back into positive gamma."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6185960","6190960"," Well, here gets something going on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6190960","6201960"," You can't even so I'm willing to entertain the bull case, but for me to put a bull suit on need to reclaim a move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6201960","6210960"," Another another way for the bulls to have the bull case would be consolidation."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6210960","6212960"," And some sort of continuation."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6212960","6215960"," So it doesn't have to be this channel."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6215960","6220960"," It can be a channel down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6220960","6221960"," Right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6221960","6229960"," So if you're so if the bulls want some if you want a bull case, you'd have to have some kind of sideways and up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6229960","6233960"," And then a break still still a break above."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6234960","6244960"," Zero gamma, right? So it doesn't matter if trade sideways, then goes up, then you'd take the bull case, but right now it's there's no bull case. So."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6244960","6253960"," Question then becomes if you're a bear, where do you want to take a short of the market because you should have your bull suit on you shouldn't have your bull suit on this morning."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6253960","6259960"," Like or like a over a timeline, let's say it's two weeks or a month out, you shouldn't."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6259960","6265960"," A timeline that's three months out right now, you should have a bear suit on like the bears are in charge right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6265960","6268960"," I want you to know that you have to know that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6268960","6275960"," So I asked the question, do we get to our one or our two today? I said we get to our one. Why am I saying that?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6275960","6279960"," I'm saying that because if you're a bear, you kind of want to see."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6279960","6283960"," Or have a place to sell."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6283960","6288960"," You can already see that's happening. You can see bears are entering into that cell right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6288960","6290960"," You see this pivot point right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6290960","6301960"," For my, for my cursors right here, you're going to have bears entering right here. You know, fuck it. You're going to have, you're going to have bulls trying to get unfucked here and you're also going to get some bears."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6301960","6307960"," They're going to say, I don't care. We're going back down, taking a put spread right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6307960","6313960"," You're going to get other bears that are going to be like, Nope, this is where the smart money bears are going to be. They're going to be up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6313960","6323960"," We can see them right on. We can see them right on the book map, right? They're right there. Just right and jump back right back in. So you've got smart money bears above saying this is where I'm heading in."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6323960","6326960"," And then you've got like the really cheap bears."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6326960","6331960"," And they're probably up here at our three. Our two are three. What they're saying is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6331960","6339960"," No, no, no, no, let's let the bulls get back in here. They'll feel safe. And then we're just going to slam it right back down again. So you've got like three levels here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6339960","6344960"," And I want you to know that these three places there are fucking bears waiting."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6344960","6350960"," Just waiting. Not to continue to sell this market. I warned you of that. Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6350960","6359960"," That we're bearish. And until bulls can get constructive."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6359960","6364960"," Get above this zero gamma where these these are the nastiest bears right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6365960","6375960"," If these sellers are weak, yeah, you'll seek some consolidation. And then this continuation. This is where we put the bull head on, right? So we're we have a bullish stance there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6375960","6380960"," We have a bearish stance, bull stance below."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6380960","6384960"," But if anyone out there is telling you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6384960","6393960"," You have to be bearish in here. So even if we trade a pyre here today, your ultimate, what are you thinking? So what what's your thought process."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6393960","6397960"," On an intraday. You would say."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6397960","6400960"," You would say I'm bullish on intraday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6400960","6407960"," But only for me to find or already have a predetermined place to sell the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6407960","6414960"," Right. So, so you would say I'm bearish, but I don't want to be I don't want to be buying puts here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6414960","6417960"," I want to be buying them up here or up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6418960","6422960"," Or even higher, whether I showed you on that five minute chart. So if you're bearish."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6422960","6426960"," Or if you're speaking to somebody and they're like, what are you right now?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6426960","6429960"," You can be like, I'm bullish right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6429960","6434960"," And but I'm just waiting for us to get to a certain level for me to fucking sell this shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6434960","6440960"," You'll see bears say, I don't care. I'm just going to start selling this right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6440960","6445960"," I'm going to sell everything here until it fails. So it starts bloodbath and down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6446960","6458960"," I assure you that we are or you should be wearing a bear suit and just waiting for your for wherever you want to take a take a short of the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6458960","6461960"," Take a put position, take a put spread, whatever you want."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6461960","6466960"," Over time, you want to put on a bearish or you that we are in."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6466960","6470960"," Or wearing a bear suit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6471960","6478960"," That should be your ultimate stance on the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6480960","6482960"," And that would be."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6482960","6488960"," You're like, you're like, like, right in today right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6488960","6494960"," You want you're looking for positioning weekly looking for positioning monthly looking for positioning."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6494960","6498960"," If you guys want to know where this ends."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6499960","6503960"," We're like, if we stay bearish, where does it end? We know where it ends, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6503960","6507960"," Oh, it's what's where the market becomes oversold."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6507960","6510960"," They'll sell this until it's oversold."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6510960","6516960"," And we have ways to go. We know that there are sectors that didn't have it even started selling it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6516960","6520960"," We know that some that we know there's tech bulls out there that are just."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6520960","6523960"," Parking their asses in some stocks, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6524960","6530960"," Paypal expands cryptocurrency by and sell and hold service to Luxembourg according to a statement."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6530960","6535960"," We can look at where sector like sector rotational selling."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","6559960","6567960"," But I usually check the sectors of the S&P 500 and see which sectors are selling each day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6567960","6576960"," If they're rotating into selling each sector, you can target those to sell."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","6626960","6629960"," This is constructive for the bulls."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6629960","6631960"," You see how we have these lows down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6631960","6634960"," This is where you want to be buying the market when we're down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6634960","6637960"," This doesn't you know what the best part about this is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6637960","6640960"," It doesn't matter what the price is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6640960","6643960"," So if you're like, well, take cap."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6643960","6645960"," How far do we actually go down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6646960","6647960"," To buy a dip."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6647960","6651960"," You want to see this come down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6651960","6653960"," Come down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6653960","6656960"," I'll start getting bullish again."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6656960","6657960"," Makes sense."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6657960","6659960"," And right now we're not there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6659960","6663960"," Right now we are."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6663960","6670960"," We are right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6671960","6674960"," This is currently where we are right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6674960","6677960"," Kind of like a neutral place, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6677960","6685960"," Where do you want to buy a dip?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6685960","6687960"," Or get stuck in bullish again."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6687960","6691960"," You want you want this red line to come down here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6691960","6693960"," Into this green zone."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6694960","6699960"," The deeper it goes, the more bullish you should be getting."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6699960","6702960"," You can see it right here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6702960","6704960"," You can see watch my cursor right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6704960","6706960"," See this right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6706960","6707960"," See that?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6707960","6709960"," You can buy that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6709960","6711960"," You can buy that right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6711960","6713960"," Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6713960","6716960"," You can buy that right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6716960","6719960"," You can buy that right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6719960","6721960"," You can buy that right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6721960","6726960"," You probably get fucked up in here, but we'll talk about that later about getting fucked"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6726960","6728960"," up in a position."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6728960","6730960"," See right here?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6730960","6732960"," You're like, I want to fight about this cap."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6732960","6734960"," What if I had bought this cap?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6734960","6736960"," What if I had bought this cap?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6736960","6739960"," You can put time in those trades right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6739960","6742960"," See right there is a nice little bottom."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6742960","6746960"," It's over the course of a year."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6746960","6749960"," You can see one right there and see one right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6749960","6753960"," Once we get down here, then you look at it and say, well, what needs to get sold?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6753960","6755960"," I'll tell you exactly what needs to get sold."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6755960","6756960"," Utilities."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6756960","6760960"," You want to put a short in the fucking market?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6760960","6761960"," Utilities."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6761960","6765960"," I think this is consumer."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6765960","6770960"," I think this is, I forget what the CNS is, but I think it's consumer staples."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6770960","6771960"," I think this is staples."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6771960","6774960"," Hasn't been sold to fuck down yet."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6775960","6778960"," You know what?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6778960","6781960"," Hold on, we'll put up one more."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6781960","6788960"," We'll bring this back up for you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6788960","6792960"," Bulls have a, Bulls have a,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6792960","6796960"," man, you know what?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6796960","6798960"," See right here?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6798960","6801960"," We had something similar happen before."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6802960","6805960"," You're probably going to see at some point."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6805960","6807960"," We'll trade down and then this is like the fake."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6807960","6811960"," This is the bull trap right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6811960","6816960"," You get that pump up and so it fails and then we continue down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6816960","6820960"," You can see where that, where that is, it's like right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6820960","6824960"," And then we started bloodbath and it down again."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6824960","6827960"," You're going to, I'm going to make a prediction to you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6827960","6828960"," How about this?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6828960","6830960"," You want a prediction?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6830960","6838960"," I'm betting you that I'm betting you that you'll see this PPO come down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6838960","6843960"," You'll see us come down right about there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6843960","6845960"," You'll see the S&P 500."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6845960","6847960"," Let's go to 3820."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6847960","6851960"," It's going to be my, right now, but I'll give you a bunch of targets."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6851960","6852960"," 3820."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6852960","6859960"," I've got a target on S&P 500 in the, in the near term next week or two."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6859960","6864960"," I would, I'm going to expect this to bleed off into, into FMC."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6864960","6866960"," That's going to be my expectation."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6866960","6868960"," I have a price target of 3820."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6868960","6869960"," That's true."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6869960","6870960"," That's legit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6870960","6876960"," I bet that we'll, when we're at three, two zero, we're going to be right about here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6876960","6884960"," And it's going to be teed up for FMC to then start bloodbath and get down or to rip higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6884960","6886960"," Bull's going to make a case for this too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6886960","6888960"," They're going to say the breath is down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6888960","6890960"," You're going to say the PPO is kind of ready."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6890960","6900960"," And if we do get that, if we do get that continuation here and the breath is down, that we could get that 4300 and 4400."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6900960","6901960"," Right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6901960","6903960"," We'll get that off 3320."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6903960","6905960"," We could, we'll, we'll, we'll trade up there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6905960","6906960"," Absolutely."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6906960","6913960"," So let's put your next target is 3820."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6914960","6918960"," From there, depending upon what the, what the FMC says."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6918960","6921960"," Upper target for 30 lower target."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","6921960","6924960"," I won't, I won't know that here, but."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","7218960","7223960"," Actually, this would actually turn into the next cell."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7223960","7226960"," So you can just get rid of this right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7227960","7243960"," Trade looks something like that."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","7314960","7316960"," Sold it below the moving averages."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7316960","7318960"," Now that they're under the moving averages,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7318960","7326960"," the bears are trying to attack to take this down to 3900."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7326960","7330960"," I can't see that I don't think."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7330960","7334960"," This."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7334960","7338960"," You can see right here right is the moving average right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7338960","7341960"," Vwops right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7341960","7344960"," Right and they said we knew there are sellers up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7344960","7346960"," Hiden right we said there's sellers up in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7346960","7348960"," They sold it down successfully."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7348960","7352960"," Took it right to the to the moving averages right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7352960","7356960"," Vwop sold it down underneath Vwop."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7356960","7362960"," Top of the key right here and now they're now they're going to try to slam it down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7362960","7367960"," Nice bear trade by the way."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7367960","7370960"," Where is the price target from here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7370960","7375960"," We know it's we know it's down here where the smart money is right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7375960","7381960"," We know the bears are going to push it down down here or attempt to at least."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7381960","7385960"," So just keep an eye on the markets overall with the stock market so stocks."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7385960","7389960"," Can't seem to find solid ground with the treasury market signaling growing bets."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7389960","7394960"," On an economic downturn amid restrictive federal reserve policy."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7394960","7400960"," You also have traders weighing comments from Putin who stopped short of fighting not to use with nuclear weapons."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","7410960","7416960"," He didn't reiterate it that Russia will defend itself and it's allies with all means if necessary."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7416960","7422960"," Other than that has it been anything else in regards to headlines."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7422960","7429960"," City cities Fraser Jane Fraser CEO saying we're in recession in Europe already."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7429960","7434960"," And there is some softening in the US economy."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7434960","7437960"," Yeah it said no news day right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7437960","7442960"," So we knew that coming in today sponsored by ticks right ticks right allows you to."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7442960","7444960"," Beer on beer, beer back."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7444960","7448960"," For example rubber bands on bull balls."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7448960","7449960"," You guys are hilarious."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7449960","7455960"," The US recession is likely in the second half of next year."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7455960","7458960"," Yeah the smart money to buy is down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7458960","7461960"," I'd buy this down here in a minute."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7461960","7465960"," And intraday traders are going to trade this area right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7465960","7471960"," Like boiler room traders they're just buying in here selling in here buying in here selling in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7471960","7475960"," Smart money is down below smart money is down here to buy."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7475960","7479960"," Just standing on a go please give me a let me get a let me buy some of this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7479960","7484960"," On a larger time frame for you know."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","7491960","7493960"," I promise you."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","7500960","7502960"," I promise you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7508960","7512960"," D.A.P. is saying Captain James first day in your ship thanks for being with wise captain."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7512960","7515960"," What do you think spy will hit a 380 before the beer."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7515960","7519960"," Oh no I think it'll hit 380 like this week or next week."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7520960","7524960"," Like like next five days next five sessions."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7524960","7530960"," Maybe six or maybe you know it might not actually hit 3820 it might just."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7530960","7531960"," It'll."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7531960","7534960"," It'll be close."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7534960","7537960"," It'll be close."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7537960","7541960"," Oh no you know no no yeah so."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7541960","7546960"," Someone saying no so no hope for 400 end of month Santa's dead."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7546960","7548960"," No Santa's not dead."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7548960","7549960"," I just went through that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7549960","7550960"," You guys didn't see that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7550960","7553960"," I just had the chart up showing you that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7553960","7556960"," I just showed you my expectations."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7556960","7558960"," You guys are you guys all fault."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7558960","7563960"," If you're out there listening to me right now right stop anything you're doing unless you're in a trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7563960","7567960"," I want you to fucking watch what I just said."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7567960","7571960"," Okay so we'll do it again."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7571960","7573960"," We'll do it live."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7574960","7575960"," So."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7575960","7579960"," It's a pretty fairly easy way to predict this stuff."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7579960","7582960"," It's not we're not trying to complicate stuff here okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7582960","7586960"," Way to watch my cursor over here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7586960","7590960"," You can see all these sectors of the S&P 500 right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7590960","7591960"," So."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7591960","7596960"," Accumulation distribution right we can talk about accumulation distribution."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7596960","7601960"," So bulls bought the market down here okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7601960","7605960"," And now they're going to take profit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7605960","7609960"," They have some signals to take profit right we broke trend."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7609960","7615960"," So bulls are going to say oh I'm just going to take some money off the table and look for a place to buy the market again."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7615960","7623960"," Logical right I don't care what the overall trend of the market is I just care that I can find an entry into the market and then I can sell for profit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7624960","7627960"," This is like the logic of how you make money."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7627960","7631960"," How you really make money in this stock market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7631960","7640960"," And so as a bull you should be bullish as a as a town is and if you're out sometimes you can trade better as a bear but up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7640960","7646960"," You'll make more money even if you're a bear over time at least knowing where the market's going to get bought."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7646960","7648960"," Knowing where the market's going to get bought."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7648960","7652960"," Knowing how long the market's going to be held for."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7652960","7656960"," And especially if you're a bull like where do I buy cap."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7656960","7659960"," That kind of stuff right so."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7659960","7664960"," And there are basic ways to find out oversold and overbought conditions."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7664960","7667960"," Our places that you buy and sell the market the trend doesn't matter."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7667960","7671960"," Well you didn't know that okay see this chart right here wait to see this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7671960","7673960"," That didn't matter here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7673960","7679960"," Didn't matter here that the these kind of moves over the years mean nothing."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7679960","7687960"," As a bull that they'll mean I guess to some extent you could make an argument hey cap I only want to buy."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","7830200","7832400"," Me as a bull. I'm looking for"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7833240","7840120"," Some breath to go down right to come back to a buy zone. I'm also looking at sectors and I'm saying okay"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7840120","7843120"," What have they whacked so far well, they've whacked the industrials"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7843720","7847360"," Right looks this looks like I think this is a tech got whacked"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7848280","7852720"," There's some fucking bulls hanging out in utilities. They haven't sold yet"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7853120","7856320"," So I'm gonna my real key right now that I'm looking for is utilities"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7856320","7860520"," It's gonna be a signal for me to every enter the market once utility sells off"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7860520","7866440"," I could probably guess that we're gonna you'll start to see a ramp in an accumulation in other sectors, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7869040","7873880"," And I'm looking at the price that we're at right now. I know we're at our lower levels and other hundred points lower"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7873880","7875880"," I know the spy can go lower, right"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7876880","7878880"," So I'm looking for"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7880240","7882240"," I'm looking for breath to come down"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7883920","7889240"," This is market breath and the price percent oscillator is actually kind of showing you, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7890640","7896320"," And you see this trend down right even though we're green up here the same thing's happening right now. You can see it"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7896760","7898760"," You see the purple bars down here"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7901560","7903240"," See it right there, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7903280","7908480"," So if you're a bull you're looking for an inflection points, right? You're looking for this to come down right here"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7909960","7910880"," And"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7910880","7917920"," Where's the next major level lower right is 380 20? We know already we looked yesterday on yesterday's stream"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7918600","7922760"," There's a big giant gap down there easy for us to sell down there. Nope. Nope. No worries"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7922760","7926640"," I'm almost guaranteed that you'd see us trade down here and"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7927600","7929600"," You'd see us hit this mark right here"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7930280","7932560"," So an inflection point 38 20"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7933320","7938040"," I'm just gonna put that out there for myself as a bull and say I'm gonna say to myself"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7938040","7944680"," I'm gonna say okay, so I'm gonna I might not hit there, but I'm gonna that's what I'm gonna say right I'm looking for like 30 20"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7945880","7948880"," And I'm gonna watch this monitor where we are here"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7949720","7955000"," See if it corresponds if it doesn't let's say I put up 30 20 down here"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7956560","7958560"," Right there and"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7959160","7961160"," We'll get rid of this"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7962160","7964840"," So this is my price target right here 3820"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7965480","7972160"," Now, let's say we start selling off and we're not at 3820. Let's say like 3850 and I've got some puts on right now, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7973880","7977840"," For 3820 and we're heading down towards it. We're heading down towards it"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7978480","7982400"," Let's say we're like only right here, but the breath is low, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7983760","7985760"," And let's say we're right here"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7985760","7987760"," And"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7988040","7990960"," Let's say let's say we're only at like 3840"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7991520","7993960"," 384 this would be a time for me"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7994360","7999560"," Even though I have a target of 38 20 it'd be time for me to take some profit and say you know what?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","7999560","8002800"," I'm gonna take some off the table. I targeted 3830 20"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8002800","8008200"," But you know the breadth of the markets kind of getting down there and the risk is now coming into my short position"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8008200","8009880"," So I'll pull my short off"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8009880","8014040"," Right take my profit and look to see what the interaction is here"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8014040","8017640"," And I'm also looking for some kind of news event around here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8018640","8024400"," Magically you guys ever noticed magically you see something like this happen. This is predicting the future, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8024400","8030040"," And shockingly there'll be a news event when this happens. I promise you there'll be like an FMC"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8030040","8034480"," There'll be some fucking CPI. There'll be we some kind of nonsense and"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8035560","8039640"," Shockingly you'll be at this price point when we come into that news"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8040240","8046420"," Now if we were if we had traded higher into that FMC or that or that OPEC or not OPEC"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8047560","8050000"," CPI print or something like if we traded high into that"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8050520","8055920"," I'd be I would be expecting bad news to come from that event for us to sell"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8056600","8058600"," So when we head into"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8059240","8066400"," FMC and CPI I am going to expect good news because we sold down into it. Does it always happen? No, I"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8066960","8073320"," Would rely upon that indicator though way more than anything a nonsense. I hear on Twitter"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8073960","8075960"," Especially if it gets really bearish"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8076520","8081160"," If it gets really bullish and we're trading down into it, I'd be I wouldn't I wouldn't I don't like that trade either"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8081160","8082840"," I prefer"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8082840","8088280"," That if we let like trading down into an event that the company of of chatter is bearish"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8088800","8095520"," The more chatter of bearish the more trading down into an event the more bullish I get if people are bullish into that event"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8096400","8100600"," And we're trading down into it. I'm probably going to take a neutral stance or even a bearish stance"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8101680","8107560"," So that's what I'm looking for. I'm looking for this into OPEC now or into FMC. I'm looking for that trade down"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8108240","8110240"," into FMC and"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8110240","8116240"," For an inflection point for for for a bull. So let's say we head down here slam down here"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8116240","8120120"," it's fucking mark or it's December fucking 14th 13th and"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8120920","8123320"," They're waiting for the decision, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8124200","8126520"," This would be where I'm going to start to think about"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8126920","8130960"," Taking a long or short if you're if you're not a great trader or can't pick a direction"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8131760","8133760"," There's no need for you to worry about it"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8134560","8139520"," Are we go? Is there a chance to go to 400 again cap or 430 shabs of fucking lutely?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8139760","8144560"," You don't even have to be in a position you could go right into you could go right into the decision"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8146240","8152760"," The FOMC and wait for their decision and you already know if the markets positive for more than likely"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8152840","8159720"," Heading back up here like 420 430 you already know that if the if the decision is is going to be hawkish"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8160680","8166480"," Where's your next level right? So you're like where's the next level from bearish at 38 20 and we're at the"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8166880","8172240"," And we're at the event right at the FMC meeting you can measure that move it's easy"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8172440","8178520"," At least have some kind of an idea we already measured it earlier this morning that we got a number of three two or three"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8178520","8185320"," It was at three 32 64. I think we measured for continuation down, right? That's just right just like right here"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8185800","8191360"," Does it make sense? So the full move 100% down from the top of the key right here is 32"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8191360","8196000"," I believe 32 32 60 so you've got yeah, I just gave you like three price targets"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8198480","8200400"," 3820 a"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8200400","8205360"," Decision and then I move higher to 420. Let's say or a move low lower to"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8206000","8210400"," 32 64 it makes sense makes life pretty fucking easy"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8212800","8214800"," It makes life very very simple"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8216000","8220960"," For your stances like this is what I'm looking for this is how why I'm why I'm being a bear"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8220960","8222800"," This is why I'm being a bull"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8222800","8226160"," These are the prices that I'm looking for this is the time frame that I'm looking in"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8228120","8232960"," To get there this is now I'm looking at so I'm gonna bullish there are bearish stance right now, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8233120","8236120"," Where do I want to position myself as a bear to get there?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8236120","8239720"," Do I want to start selling at a zero gamma pair?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8239720","8241720"," Do I want to sell it our one up here?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8242120","8246800"," Do I want to just start fucking laying it on it, you know, you guys understand I'm saying"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8254560","8259560"," So someone's asking me now is that the move that you're calling for for CPI. That's my stance"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8259840","8263400"," That's my stance for into CPI. I'm so fucking luley"

"_i07-eFwW4Y","8310640","8316880"," You didn't get any confirmation we're breaking trend in here. Did you you had no confirmation?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8317600","8319920"," We didn't break down in here. Did we?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8321520","8323520"," We didn't break down in here. Did we?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8325120","8327120"," We didn't break down in here. Did we?"

"_i07-eFwW4Y","8347560","8351400"," Where's where's the next logical place? We already looked at where you looked at the"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8352000","8356120"," Where do you look at the market profile? There's a giant fucking gap in here"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8357080","8358560"," giant gap"

"_i07-eFwW4Y","8387440","8391560"," Coming up on the 14th over here. I think it's rational to say we go down here"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8391560","8395440"," I can see that there's still big money hiding in utilities"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8396000","8398720"," I'm looking in sectors that are still fat as fuck right now"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8399640","8401640"," And they haven't been liquidated"

"_i07-eFwW4Y","8408840","8416120"," It's it's absolutely logical that I would be in a bear stance down here. It was absolutely logical that I would be in a bull"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8416120","8420880"," Stance here, right made made a lot of money"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8421520","8422920"," like this"

"_i07-eFwW4Y","8434520","8439000"," 20 we're gonna watch some other indicators to see if we get there, but that's my target"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8439560","8442120"," Right, that's my stance. I'm looking forward to happen. I"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8443120","8449320"," I need a bunch of bears though to think we're going even war even lower before then so we can actually get"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8449800","8454880"," Some there's a whole other thing. This is about buying puts and calls and do we actually get to that price target?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8454880","8456880"," I don't care if we actually do though"

"_i07-eFwW4Y","8478440","8484400"," Do we actually get 30 20 caps like do I fucking care as long as I'm fucking short into?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8484960","8492360"," That event and the market selling off and I can watch a breath in the market. I don't care. Just making money"

"_i07-eFwW4Y","8511400","8517880"," Positive gamma is regained. I have no reason you shouldn't die there. You should have no reason to be like"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8518720","8522600"," I'm bullish here cap and I'll be honest this trade higher"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8524040","8528760"," So this this trade higher if let's say you're this you're like the top and bottom collar and"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8529320","8536880"," You're like oh, yeah cap. I called it and we traded all the way up here and we held zero gamma. I assure you I assure you"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8538280","8543840"," That if you made this trade or this call or this shot collar as a bear or shot collar as a bull"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8544240","8546320"," Right and you actually trade this"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8546960","8550480"," That you'll fail you can see it you can see it over the past month"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8551760","8553760"," That when you're in trend"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8555640","8559480"," You would have gotten smoked in here, right? You would have gotten smoked here. You would have gotten smoked here"

"_i07-eFwW4Y","8568760","8573200"," It's gonna roll cap. It's gonna roll cap. You can say that but you can't take that trade until you get confirmation"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8573600","8575840"," Right now you've got confirmation that we're going down"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8576320","8582320"," So you trade this as we're going down until we have a trend reversal."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8582320","8586320"," So if you're a bull and you're like in bull's hair cap, okay, that's fine."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8586320","8590320"," But you're not going to take a bull's trade until you get back into a trend this way."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8590320","8597320"," Or you get back into a trend this way and break above zero gamma or positive gamma."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8597320","8601320"," This is when you'd be like, all right, cap down bull, fucking bullish man, we're going up."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","8608320","8610320"," You're bearish."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8610320","8615320"," You're a trader investor out there telling you."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","8637320","8640320"," I promise you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8640320","8645320"," Yeah, I want to sell that up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8645320","8647320"," See this seller's hiding right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8647320","8648320"," It came."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8648320","8650320"," They swooped right in up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8650320","8653320"," This would right up right up in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8653320","8654320"," I didn't even care."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8654320","8656320"," They're just sitting right here hiding."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8656320","8658320"," There they are up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8658320","8659320"," There they are up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8659320","8660320"," Sellers right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8660320","8661320"," Sellers right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8661320","8663320"," Sellers getting more aggressive."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8663320","8664320"," Sellers right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8664320","8666320"," Sellers came back in today."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8666320","8669320"," All of this is indicative of selling the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8669320","8677320"," No change."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8677320","8678320"," No change."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8678320","8679320"," They sold it down from right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8679320","8681320"," They were hiding right up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8681320","8682320"," And they'll do it again."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8682320","8688320"," They're going to do it to you again and again and again."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8688320","8691320"," Until they're going to do it to you again until the market breadth."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8691320","8692320"," Either."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8692320","8695320"," Becomes oversold."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8695320","8698320"," Or there's some news that we don't know."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8698320","8703320"," Some kind of unknown positive news for the bulls and they're just going to keep selling it until."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8703320","8705320"," We're in oversold conditions."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8705320","8708320"," Once we're in oversold conditions, they'll pull the shorts off."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8708320","8711320"," And they'll let the market breathe again."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8711320","8713320"," Makes sense."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8713320","8716320"," Hey, Mary, how are you?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8717320","8720320"," This fucking group does rock."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8720320","8724320"," This group does fucking rock."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8724320","8733320"," It's the I'm telling is it as a trader, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8733320","8737320"," As a dip fire as a bull as a bear."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8737320","8739320"," If you can learn those concepts, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8739320","8742320"," You can trade with those concepts as a bull or a bear."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8743320","8747320"," If you're like, I only do well selling the market cap."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8747320","8749320"," We saw it happen."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8749320","8752320"," We watched it happen two days ago, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8752320","8755320"," We're like, hey, we lost the pivot today."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8755320","8757320"," We didn't get a new higher high."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8757320","8758320"," We didn't get a new higher high."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8758320","8760320"," We lost the pivot."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8760320","8765320"," Then we lost the 200 and we lost positive gamma with negative gamma, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8765320","8767320"," So you like adding all these things up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8767320","8770320"," And you start to say, if you're a bull, you're like, man, you know what?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8770320","8772320"," Time to start taking some money off the table."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8772320","8774320"," If you trade like this, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8774320","8776320"," If you trade like this, you're going to be able to take."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8776320","8778320"," You're going to be able to sell the market with confidence."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8778320","8780320"," You're going to be able to sell or buy the market with confidence."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8780320","8783320"," You might have one bad trade out of 10."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8783320","8787320"," You're not going to be listening to people that are telling you otherwise."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8787320","8793320"," Like when we were at that last bottom in October, I had fucking people all on my,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8793320","8798320"," I had people commenting in my stream, like you're crazy buying this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8798320","8800320"," I have that every time we're in a bottom."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8800320","8805320"," Right now, more than likely, there's probably bull saying you're crazy selling this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8805320","8810320"," As soon as the mechanics are met and the bottoms and tops,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8810320","8815320"," you can usually take those with some kind of confidence."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8815320","8820320"," You can look at a breath indicator, regardless of what's going on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8820320","8824320"," You can look at a breath indicator, regardless of where the market goes."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8824320","8829320"," So if the fucking market's trading down over two years, the fucking market's trading up for five years,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8829320","8831320"," you're just using the breath indicator."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8831320","8840320"," It doesn't, the breath indicator does not care about the ups and downs of the markets."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8840320","8844320"," Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8844320","8845320"," That's right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8845320","8851320"," And Vescro knows exactly what's up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8851320","8858320"," Vescro knows exactly what's up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8858320","8863320"," Your trading journey will become easier."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8863320","8869320"," Your journey of calmness becomes a lot easier."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8876320","8882320"," If you have a top or bottom of a channel and the breath indicator, it's a pretty solid risk."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8882320","8896320"," Yeah, there's a, I've been back testing this for, to like my, my large money trades are fairly used with that kind of prediction model."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8896320","8903320"," And they, they, they print man, they fucking print, they print nine times out of 10."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8903320","8911320"," If you want to go into size in a trade, usually the most oversold conditions, you can usually buy that regardless of where prices."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8911320","8920320"," Regardless, and if you put it on with time on it or in actual owning stock, your time horizon for making money."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8920320","8928320"," Three months, max four months, three months, I think the widest I've had to wait is three months."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8929320","8937320"," Roughly in there. So even if you're just buying stock or the shares, even if you get a market bloodbath collapse."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8937320","8948320"," That, that shit would get bought up in the next three months and come right back to where you started."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8949320","8958320"," Yeah, so GP eight zero zero eight is saying, agree on everything, but don't you think that PPI."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8958320","8962320"," CPI FOMC are potentially major upside move triggers. Yeah, I don't."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8962320","8971320"," So, so when I look at the way that I view news is different than than a lot of what the cacophony of news is out there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8972320","8980320"," I can show you where we've sold into, or we've bought every FOMC, not every, I think it's like seven out of 10 of the last FOMC is we've bought."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8980320","8985320"," And I think we've sold seven out of the last 10 minutes."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8985320","8990320"," You can see we're selling the minute or they were selling the main meeting right now, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8990320","8994320"," I'd be a more confident in the bullish narrative."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","8995320","9002320"," If we're able to sell down into into FOMC, I would, if we were able to sell down to 30, 20 into FOMC."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9002320","9009320"," I can already, I can already look and see that there's a inflection point for bulls to have a move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9009320","9013320"," Right. If we sold into, so let me show you this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9013320","9018320"," You guys, when you guys hear people say like, good news is good news, bad news is bad news and all of a sudden."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9018320","9020320"," Good news is bad news and bad news."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9020320","9026320"," ECB is often paid dispute to hold talks about potential strike, according to financial times."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9026320","9029320"," So you'll hear people say that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9029320","9033320"," And that's all about market breadth."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9033320","9035320"," That's all about market breadth."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9035320","9036320"," There's no real set."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9036320","9039320"," They're using the news to sell the market or buy the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9039320","9045320"," When the reality is the breadth is oversold or overbought."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9045320","9051320"," When you can do this on different timeframes, one day, five days, month, year."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9051320","9055320"," This dream is sponsored by to the tick. Get free daily points."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","9060320","9062320"," The moment that you do that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9062320","9068320"," When you start to put the blind, when I say put the blinders on, it's because they're paying attention to."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9069320","9072320"," What's used that you're like, oh, you read them."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9072320","9078320"," You'll be like, like, I'll see like the market sell off and I'm like, I'm like, what are they using for news today for selling the market off."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9078320","9086320"," And they're like, like the market is the market is, you know, awaiting this decision or the market is built."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9086320","9092320"," They write all these stupid articles and then you just look at some other indicators and you're like, Oh, yeah, we're, we're, we're bought right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9092320","9094320"," That's actually the reason we're."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9094320","9112320"," We're, we're, we're, we're."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9112320","9121320"," Yeah, I was going to say, and he thinks that we consolidate and make the bones higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9121320","9125320"," A letter."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9125320","9135320"," Well, that was my expectation is the move down and the yesterday at the close, we're talking about."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9135320","9140320"," This here's Friday right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9140320","9142320"," This Monday right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9142320","9148320"," You'd likely see between now and Monday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9149320","9157320"," Move to, I think it's our one right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9157320","9161320"," And then a resumption down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9161320","9179320"," Something like that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9179320","9184320"," I think we're talking about putting on call spreads for Friday or Monday expiry."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9184320","9199320"," In the money."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9199320","9207320"," Eight, eight, eight, zero, zero, eight is boob cap."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9207320","9229320"," If you trade some crypto for a while, then go back to equates will become more zen."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9230320","9240320"," Yeah, Christian saying news accelerates action to support or supply and demand levels doesn't change them."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9240320","9243320"," Yeah, it doesn't like news is a weird fucking thing."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9243320","9257320"," When you're like, you know what else is cool about news is when there's, when there's breaking news that the market doesn't know, like the banks don't know."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9257320","9262320"," You almost always see mean reverse or reversion back."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9262320","9271320"," So if like, then it doesn't matter if it's positive or negative."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9271320","9286320"," If you have something that the market does not have priced in quote unquote, either positive or negative, you will almost always see the price or return to its original price almost always."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9287320","9297320"," And it can continue higher from there or lower, but you'll almost always see that happen."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9297320","9301320"," Almost every time."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9302320","9303320"," Hey, invest."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9303320","9309320"," I'm going to be in Utah for Sundance."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9309320","9317320"," I went skiing last weekend and now I think I'll be there the 19th weekend of the 19th."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9317320","9320320"," I think it's like Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9320320","9324320"," I don't want to stay the whole week, or I think it's like a two week."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9324320","9329320"," But every time I go, I feel like the second half of it is kind of an afterthought."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9329320","9333320"," I like going the when it starts because no one's on the mountain."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9333320","9336320"," Everyone's like in town partying and stuff."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9336320","9339320"," So like the skiing is fucking phenomenal."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9339320","9341320"," There's no skiers there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9341320","9344320"," Everybody's focused on the film festival."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9344320","9352320"," So I was going to ski that weekend for like three or four days and then spend my nights."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9352320","9366320"," Trying to sneak into a very small concerts and shit like that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9366320","9372320"," Yeah, you'll see crazy things like."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9372320","9381320"," If you see like positive news, you'll see like an initial spike up, then it'll come back down and then if the news is real, it'll start to trade into that direction."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9381320","9390320"," Same on same on bad news."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9390320","9392320"," Bill saying by the dips and get rich."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9392320","9399320"," Yeah, you know, like."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9399320","9400320"," It doesn't really."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9400320","9418320"," When you hear things like by the dips and get rich, like."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9418320","9421320"," There's a time to buy the dips."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9421320","9428320"," There's a time to sell the rips."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9428320","9436320"," Normally it's positive gamma, as long as we stay above positive, going to see volatil to get lower to see every pricing of the VIX."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9436320","9446320"," That's the that's the time to buy the dip in a screen by the dip."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9446320","9448320"," Spy for 50 by New Year's right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9448320","9451320"," No, sorry, Bill."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9451320","9453320"," Maybe."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9453320","9462320"," It's not saying that right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9462320","9470320"," It's got a magnet down below book maps showing a magnet down below at 393900."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9470320","9473320"," Smart money is down below."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9473320","9496320"," Let's show you that right here so you can see it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9496320","9502320"," H Y G and small caps relative strength today. Nothing more than consolidation."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9502320","9513320"," In a larger timeframe, you'd expect to have at least a rip higher to sell into."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9513320","9519320"," Mm hmm."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9519320","9527320"," You can so like H Y G and J and K. The reason I watch them is sometimes you'll see divergences."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9527320","9531320"," It's a good question. Let's talk about that real quick."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9531320","9536320"," Let's do. Let me see if you can do it over here. I'll show you what I'm talking about."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","9548320","9555320"," Like why do you you might ask the question like why do you care what a H."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9555320","9560320"," Okay, so get your pencil and paper out. Ready? Tell you something very simple. Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9560320","9565320"," You don't have to complicate things. Make it really simple."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9565320","9570320"," You'll see like bond traders and you'll see bond guys use complicated language."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9570320","9575320"," You'll see them talking ways that you don't understand. You'll see people trying to correlate."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9575320","9580320"," Make rocket science up for you. If you're an equities trader."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9580320","9584320"," You'll hear people say bond market knows better than you do."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9587320","9592320"," And there's only as an equity trade of the dumber you the dumber you trade the better are you usually are."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9592320","9597320"," You have to have like some simple rules and you follow them. So."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9598320","9607320"," If you're a new trader, just get a piece of paper and get a note pad on your computer. I want to make it real simple for you. Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9610320","9614320"," If if TLT is going up, right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9614320","9617320"," It's showing that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9617320","9626320"," Buyers let's go try to make simple for you. So it means that buyers don't want to make risky bets."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9627320","9634320"," So they're putting it in their bond and well when so if I'm going to buy bonds, right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9635320","9639320"," If I'm like I have to make I have to put money to work out there in the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9639320","9644320"," So if I'm putting my money into TLT, if TLT is going up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9644320","9649320"," Right. And H Y G and J and K are not."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9649320","9654320"," Right. That means that I don't that I don't have faith and risk your bets."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9654320","9659320"," Makes sense. I don't make it simple."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9659320","9665320"," If TLT is flat to down and you start to see."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9665320","9670320"," J and K or H Y G going up. That means that I'm putting risk on in a risk trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9670320","9672320"," I'm saying."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9672320","9677320"," Yeah, these are risky bets. Right. Junk bonds. High yield growth bonds."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9677320","9680320"," You start seeing that going up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9680320","9684320"," It implies that I'm willing to take more risk in the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9684320","9688320"," Bond market, right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9688320","9693320"," In turn, the equity market should go up if you see."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9693320","9696320"," H Y G and J and K."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9696320","9700320"," Go up and that doesn't always happen."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9700320","9705320"," Now, like the saying of the bond traders and the bond market is smarter than you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9705320","9707320"," It's the bond market is smarter than you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9708320","9712320"," He plans more measures against Russia's energy and mining sector."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9712320","9717320"," And they and that market can tell you something about what to expect sometimes."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9717320","9721320"," In the equity market, but they're talking about as a divergence."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9721320","9724320"," Sometimes sponsored by ticks. Right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9724320","9729320"," Ticks right allows you to actually hear order flame futures for X and stock instruments."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9729320","9732320"," Give me a secondary trial at ticks. Right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9732320","9735320"," I'm going to clean this chart up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9735320","9739320"," So what they're trying to tell you is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9739320","9741320"," Put a."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9741320","9748320"," Do a comparison here and say what I'm talking about."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9748320","9750320"," Here's a Y G."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9750320","9757320"," We can we can actually do a TLT as well. If you want to hold on here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9757320","9760320"," Form a nice little base in here. Just want to do a quick update."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9760320","9764320"," We could take a trip around the market and see if we're going to make a nice little run right here in a minute."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9764320","9766320"," But I just want to show you something here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9766320","9769320"," Make it a rip right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9769320","9772320"," Make it a nice blast off here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9774320","9775320"," Nice dip."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9775320","9777320"," Dip buying opportunity right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9779320","9781320"," One, two, three."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9781320","9785320"," If you look on a book map is light resistance here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9785320","9790320"," This resistance is turning into yellow. I'd say."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9790320","9793320"," Could have a nice move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9793320","9804320"," Should should price target above three ninety five thirteen same places before."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9804320","9808320"," Would like to see it trade to three ninety five fifty next."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9808320","9812320"," And then three ninety eight sixteen."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9812320","9814320"," We'll look at."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9814320","9817320"," Quickly look at."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9817320","9821320"," Hold on here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9821320","9825320"," Just a second here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9825320","9828320"," Indicators."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9828320","9830320"," Not indicators."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9830320","9832320"," I need to put this in the same scale."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9832320","9839320"," Hold on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9840320","9843320"," I tried to do same percentage scale."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9843320","9846320"," I think it's the same percentage scale."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9846320","9849320"," Any price scale?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9849320","9851320"," Nope."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9851320","9854320"," Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9862320","9864320"," Hold on here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9864320","9871320"," It's fucking."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9871320","9873320"," Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9873320","9875320"," So here is a chart."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9875320","9877320"," This is the S&P 500 right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9877320","9882320"," Sometimes you'll see divergences in the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9882320","9883320"," Right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9883320","9884320"," Sometimes it all tracks the same."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9884320","9886320"," See that's kind of tracking the same here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9886320","9887320"," Starts to come back up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9887320","9889320"," Starts to track."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9889320","9893320"," But every once in a while you'll see a divergence on a smaller time frame."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9894320","9897320"," I want you to see this right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9897320","9899320"," See right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9899320","9902320"," See how we're still selling off down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9902320","9903320"," And yet."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9903320","9906320"," H. Y. G. is going up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9906320","9910320"," So you might get like a day of a divergence."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9910320","9913320"," You see that divergence right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9919320","9921320"," See how we're still kind of going up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9922320","9925320"," But there's a little bit of falling off on H. Y. G."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9925320","9927320"," So so it can be a lead."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9927320","9929320"," Oh, you guys can't see this shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9936320","9937320"," There's a trans."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9937320","9939320"," There's a couple, actually a 2000."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9943320","9946320"," It was a 2016, maybe 14."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9946320","9949320"," Where is that sideways market?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9949320","9951320"," I'll bring up TLT for you as well."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9951320","9954320"," But anyways, not really important."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9962320","9963320"," Bring this up for you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9968320","9970320"," Bring this time frame up for you a little bit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9973320","9974320"," See right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9975320","9976320"," See this bar right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9976320","9978320"," This is on like May 18th."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9979320","9981320"," So we're selling down right here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9982320","9985320"," And a little bit of consolidation down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9985320","9987320"," Yet you're seeing H. Y. G. go up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9988320","9990320"," So you'll get like a lead indicator."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9990320","9993320"," Maybe like a like a like a leading indicator."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9993320","9996320"," That's a day in advance half a day in advance."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","9996320","10000320"," So on a smart timeframe, let's call it like a 15 minute chart or something."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10008320","10013320"," You would start to see a H. Y. G. breaking higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10013320","10019320"," And you would see maybe consolidation here in spy, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10019320","10021320"," But you're seeing H. Y. G. take off."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10021320","10024320"," So an hour later or two, you'll actually see."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10024320","10029320"," You'll actually see finally the spy where this is going up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10030320","10032320"," And spies just consolidating."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10033320","10036320"," It's implying that you're going to get a move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10036320","10037320"," Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10038320","10042320"," So that's why I use H. Y. G. as a as a lead indicator on the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10042320","10046320"," If you started to see we're consolidating here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10047320","10052320"," And here you start seeing H. Y. G. going down, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10052320","10056320"," You'd be like, Oh, I'm going to expect a bloodbath right now and in spy,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10056320","10058320"," even though it hasn't happened yet. Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10061320","10064320"," So that's why I use H. Y. G. and J. N. K."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10068320","10069320"," In the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10070320","10074320"," And then when you're looking at Dixie, when I use Dixie here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10075320","10077320"," Remember yesterday we were looking at Dixie, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10077320","10078320"," Every day we look at Dixie."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10079320","10083320"," We say, well, how much let's say let's say H. Y. G. showing you were going to move,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10083320","10084320"," make a move higher, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10085320","10087320"," How far do how far can we go?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10088320","10089320"," And that higher move."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10090320","10091320"," So you could snap a line right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10091320","10092320"," You know where supply is, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10092320","10094320"," You know that sellers are sitting here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10094320","10095320"," You know, you had sellers here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10097320","10099320"," You know, you're going to probably have some sellers somewhere in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10100320","10105320"," So if we had a relief rally, you know, you're going to be looking for some kind of a"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10105320","10109320"," confluence up here to take another short position down to resume the down movement"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10109320","10111320"," in the market. Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10114320","10116320"," Then you're going to check, you're going to check in on the VIX, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10116320","10119320"," You're going to then take a look at the VIX and you're going to say,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10119320","10120320"," let's bring up the VIX next."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10121320","10122320"," Let's Dixie, where's VIX?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10126320","10127320"," Does Jane get whatever?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10128320","10129320"," Let's get a bucket of VIX back up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10130320","10134320"," He's on the land says we want to impose new export controls and restrictions,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10134320","10137320"," particularly for dual use goods, including key chemicals,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10138320","10142320"," nerve agents and electronics and in components that could be used by Russian"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10142320","10143320"," war machine."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10143320","10145320"," You know that buyers are down here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10146320","10147320"," Buyers of volatility are down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10148320","10149320"," Buyers of volatility down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10150320","10152320"," You know that buyers of volatility are down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10153320","10154320"," Right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10155320","10157320"," You know, there's some sellers up here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10158320","10159320"," You see sellers trying to sell it down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10160320","10161320"," Sellers trying to sell it down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10162320","10164320"," Sellers are going to come back down and try to sell it down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10165320","10166320"," You know, we made a trip up right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10167320","10168320"," So we're going to go back to the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10168320","10170320"," How long can we go down until the buyers step back in and somewhere down here?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10171320","10173320"," So it looks like a relief rally is forming, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10174320","10176320"," And then you'll see this bounce over here for continuation."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10177320","10178320"," This is the continuation down in the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10179320","10180320"," This is the relief bounce right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10181320","10182320"," Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10183320","10184320"," Yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10185320","10186320"," That's right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10187320","10188320"," That's right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10189320","10190320"," That's right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10191320","10192320"," That's right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10193320","10194320"," That's right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10195320","10196320"," That's right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10196320","10197320"," Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10201320","10206320"," So then you're on the spy and you're like, okay, we're going to get a, you're like, okay, we're going to get a relief bounce."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10211320","10212320"," Right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10212320","10215320"," Get some nice positive consolidation right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10216320","10217320"," Say, well, how much risk am I going to put on that?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10218320","10220320"," Well, fuck dealers might fuck me today."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10221320","10226320"," Um, so you say, oh, they could fuck me even into, they could, they could fuck me right into the bell on Friday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10227320","10228320"," Take it up to our one."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10229320","10231320"," You'll, people ask him Friday, like what's the move on Friday?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10231320","10232320"," We're going to sell the clothes on Friday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10233320","10234320"," Depends on what we do here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10235320","10238320"," If we trade up here today to our one, you'd expect the resumption of selling."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10240320","10244320"," If we can continue to consolidate, we make the move here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10245320","10247320"," You'd expect the resumption of selling."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10248320","10251320"," If we, if they wait until here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10253320","10255320"," Say it was a blast off on a Friday here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10255320","10256320"," We close right here on Friday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10256320","10257320"," What would you expect on Monday?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10258320","10259320"," Resumption of selling, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10260320","10261320"," Does it make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10263320","10266320"," If you're like, oh, I picked the right direction cap, but they didn't do it until Monday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10267320","10268320"," Right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10269320","10271320"," And these numbers change every day too, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10271320","10274320"," To that zero gamma, it's going to change and go up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10275320","10276320"," No, it's going to go up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10278320","10279320"," That's going to go up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10279320","10280320"," Does it make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10280320","10284320"," The longer we consolidate, the higher the potential move is going to be."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10285320","10286320"," Does it make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10287320","10289320"," And then a resumption of selling."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10290320","10292320"," Unless we can overtake the zero gamma."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10292320","10294320"," That's when you, this is by the dip."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10295320","10296320"," This is celerip."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10308320","10309320"," Not always."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10309320","10314320"," So Ergo saying, um, does, do you always see divergences?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10314320","10315320"," Not always."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10315320","10320320"," For me personally, um, how I use, I look."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10320320","10322320"," So what I do is if I'm looking to take a longer, a short position."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10323320","10328320"," What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to look around the market and I'm trying to add up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10328320","10329320"," The probabilities, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10330320","10331320"," I'm going to be looking at."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10334320","10336320"," I'm going to be looking at all of those indicators."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10336320","10339320"," I'm going to say, where's, what's the path for VIX?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10339320","10345320"," What's the path for, uh, H Y G? What's the path for, uh, J and K?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10346320","10347320"," What's the path for TLT?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10348320","10350320"," Is TLT signaling a sideways market?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10350320","10351320"," Is TLT going up?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10352320","10353320"," That's a sideways market, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10353320","10354320"," Inequities."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10356320","10361320"," Is, uh, is Dixie, does Dixie have room just to sell off here?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10361320","10365320"," Are there sellers nearby to attempt to sell Dixie?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10366320","10368320"," Then there's time of day shit on this too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10368320","10371320"," If you're trading futures contracts, like, this time's a fucking day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10371320","10372320"," You don't want along the stock market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10373320","10377320"," Uh, cause you know other countries are going to, um, be buying or buying our currencies."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10377320","10381320"," Uh, then you see traders, you see a Sator on Twitter."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10381320","10383320"," Follows the yen all the time, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10383320","10384320"," Euro dollar stuff."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10384320","10386320"," Um."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10390320","10391320"," So yeah, I'm looking for those."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10391320","10392320"," I'm looking for that setup."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10393320","10395320"," And is there always a divergence?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10395320","10397320"," No, but sometimes there is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10397320","10399320"," There's a sometimes a lead 15 minutes."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10399320","10402320"," Sometimes there's a lead of a half a day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10404320","10410320"," Sometimes you'll be sitting, I've sat here in days and I've watched our market just sell off into the bell and I'm watching H Y G just go up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10410320","10414320"," And I'm like, they're fucking pinning this market right now and it's going to explode higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10414320","10417320"," The longer they pin it, the more divergences that's created."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10417320","10420320"," The more chance for an explosive move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10420320","10425320"," Uh, but it's not always."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10425320","10432320"," But when someone's out there telling you we're going down or someone's telling you we're going up and all those other indicators are telling you something different."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10432320","10438320"," Uh, they're most more than likely wrong and you're more than likely right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10438320","10439320"," Make it thick."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10439320","10440320"," Only see red."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","10447320","10448320"," Mira is a bear right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10448320","10450320"," So Mira, where do you want to take your next short?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10452320","10455320"," Or would we're be a preference for you to take a short."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10455320","10459320"," It's like today for me, if I was to take a short."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10459320","10462320"," I'm going to look for where the bears are hiding."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10462320","10463320"," They're up here."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","10469320","10471320"," They're right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10472320","10473320"," So where are the bears hiding today?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10473320","10475320"," I'm right fucking here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10480320","10481320"," That's where they're hiding."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","10531320","10533320"," They took their jump in right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10533320","10535320"," They're like fuck you were going down."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","10558320","10561320"," I was talking about somebody last night about that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10561320","10564320"," I was like, I was like, they didn't really whack Nasdaq yet."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10564320","10565320"," They kind of did."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10565320","10568320"," Today, it's saying that Nasdaq got whacked yesterday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10568320","10570320"," I think they're down to."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10571320","10576320"," Thirty four percent or forty percent, but they still need more whacking."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10576320","10577320"," Not good."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10577320","10579320"," Thirty percent is not good enough."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10592320","10593320"," Apple's sitting in a cliff."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10601320","10615320"," Yeah, the breath indicator saying breath indicator is saying."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10615320","10625320"," If you're if you want to if you want a short sector is the best sector to short right now as utilities."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10626320","10633320"," In my view, it's the juiciest one."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10633320","10640320"," It's it's the juiciest one to short the fuck out of."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10640320","10648320"," Let me tell you the juiciest sectors are to short."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10648320","10652320"," Juiciest one hands down utilities."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10653320","10655320"," And then consumer staples, I believe."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10655320","10660320"," It'll be the next juiciest one."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10660320","10667320"," Tech is that like FinTech's at forty three communications at fifty CND."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10667320","10671320"," I don't know exactly which one that one is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10671320","10674320"," HLT is at sixty point eight."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10674320","10679320"," Utilities of Juiciest at eighty six point seven."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10680320","10682320"," Utilities is like the one you want to be."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10682320","10686320"," You want to look to be short in the fuck out of that one."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10686320","10692320"," It'll be the last one usually to go to."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10692320","10693320"," I got it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10693320","10694320"," You know, that's funny."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10694320","10700320"," Mirro is like someone was saying something about the market being at a bottom."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10700320","10702320"," And I was like, no, it's not."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10702320","10706320"," I was like fucking utilities is still like fucking ninety percent."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10707320","10711320"," Everything was at like twenty percent."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10711320","10712320"," Thirty percent."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10712320","10717320"," Everything they'd like sex rotated out of every sector except for utilities."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10717320","10721320"," And I got like a three day suspension on Twitter because I was like, if I was like,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10721320","10724320"," we can't go up until we fucking murder all the bulls and."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10724320","10726320"," And utilities."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10726320","10728320"," And so Twitter."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10728320","10729320"," I'll go bots."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10729320","10731320"," We're like, oh, you just threatened to kill somebody."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10731320","10733320"," No, I didn't."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10733320","10738320"," I was like, this is fucking bullseyed in fucking utilities."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","10744320","10746320"," But we're not going up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10746320","10751320"," And of course we had like one more blast down in the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10751320","10755320"," You guys should, uh, you know, you guys want to see a cool comparison?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10755320","10761320"," Do a comparison on, uh, an XLU."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10761320","10763320"," Do like a year long chart on XLU."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10763320","10767320"," And you, not, I think not always, but fairly often you'll see the last"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10767320","10772320"," capitulation move in a downward move in the market is utilities."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10772320","10775320"," Like compare utilities to SPX."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10775320","10780320"," And see at what part of the cycles rotation do that do we sell utilities?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10780320","10786320"," It's kind of hilarious, especially in a, in a down trend market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10792320","10803320"," Yeah, then the first one, that's the first, uh, it's the last sector to be bought"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10803320","10804320"," before a rollover."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10804320","10806320"," And it's the last sector to be sold."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10806320","10815320"," Do I believe in the Xmas rally 2022 or what?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10815320","10823320"," Uh, I believe in the Xmas rally 2022, if we can get down to 3820."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10823320","10828320"," By, um, or near there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10828320","10831320"," Not necessarily that exact price, but."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10831320","10837320"," If we can sell more into, um, CPI and."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10837320","10841320"," Fucking FOMC and all that nonsense."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10842320","10847320"," They can sell good into the, into the, uh, into the 14th, 13th, 14th."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10853320","10856320"," Everyone seems to think that the day before is going to matter more."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10856320","10858320"," I think they're going to paint the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10858320","10859320"," And they're going to trap bulls."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10859320","10861320"," I think those are going to be like, Oh, we're going up the day before."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10861320","10864320"," And I think they're going to fucking trap them in."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10864320","10866320"," Uh, and wait for."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10867320","10871320"," Jerome to speak. I think Jerome means more."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10871320","10879320"," Uh, I don't know if he's going to fuck things up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10879320","10883320"," I think if we can, if we can sell down to, uh, 3820, I think that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10883320","10886320"," There's a fair chance of a good Christmas rally."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10886320","10887320"," I do."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10887320","10888320"," I think you're going to get a."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10888320","10893320"," I think I think if we can, if we can sell down into that, into that number."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10893320","10894320"," By the 14th."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10894320","10899320"," So if you had like a, um, can't say this is how things are going to go, but."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10899320","10905320"," Uh, what I'd like to see."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","10915320","10927320"," If you're a bull and you want to like a safe Christmas rally, like you're like, uh, I feel like that I feel like I can do this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10932320","10936320"," Remember we talked about this yesterday, right? This, uh, could be Friday or Monday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10936320","10942320"," You know, the sellers are up here. I'd like to see something like, um, something like."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10943320","10946320"," It doesn't have to be exactly this, but."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10946320","10949320"," Eventually some kind of a move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10950320","10952320"," And then a sell down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10954320","10956320"," I'd like that a lot."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10956320","10958320"," If it's even this, I don't care."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10958320","10961320"," I don't care if it's this and then sideways."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10961320","10964320"," But something like this, I like."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10965320","10971320"," And then I would be bullish on CPI or Mc, whatever. I don't care what it is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10971320","10974320"," I'd be bullish on a, on a rip into the end of the year."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10976320","10978320"," Or maybe an initial rip."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10979320","10981320"," Let's just say somehow we get down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10983320","10993320"," I would expect some kind of an initial rip back back into a trend up and then a grind up, uh, into the 30 or into 23rd."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10993320","10995320"," So we can actually."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","10999320","11002320"," Actually, you can actually pop that, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11004320","11008320"," Let's do it. Let's, let's spot that. Some kind of a, uh."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11008320","11024320"," How do we plot this? We plot this like this, right? Go like this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11024320","11039320"," Probably this probably can move like this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11039320","11043320"," And then, uh, something like this, at least into the 24th."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11045320","11047320"," Right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11055320","11058320"," Something like that. I'd like to see."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11058320","11062320"," This will rip up. You might even get a bloodbath for a minute."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11062320","11064320"," Feel like I'm like a."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11064320","11066320"," Oh, geez. Oh, no."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11066320","11069320"," And then the, the, oh, no moment gets bought."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11069320","11071320"," Something like this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11071320","11073320"," That's what I'd like to see."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11073320","11076320"," Some kind of path like that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11077320","11088320"," Uh, they could hold bears to it though. Like they could do like this move right here is kind of gnarly."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11088320","11095320"," Um, let me trap all the bears in here for 38, 20."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11095320","11099320"," So that's why I don't think price really matters as much as market breadth."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11099320","11103320"," Be a quick plunge down and then, and then a resumption up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11104320","11107320"," I think trap bears near."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11107320","11111320"," Quick plunge down on, on volatility and then the rip face higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11111320","11117320"," That's how you get the fuel for the rally too. You need the bears all in over here to get the, get the fuel in the rally."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11117320","11120320"," I don't know where, I don't know where a positive gamma would be in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11120320","11125320"," We probably rip up until we hit positive gamma and then a slow grind the rest of the way. So there's some."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11125320","11131320"," It's a bunch of technical shit in here. We don't know yet."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11132320","11136320"," We'll know more as, uh, we'll know more as time goes on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11136320","11141320"," It wouldn't be exactly this. We could figure it out. I'm too lazy to figure it out to be honest with you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11141320","11145320"," Right now I'm too lazy to figure it out. I don't really care."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11145320","11150320"," Uh, this actually could, this actually could take place in the Monday too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11150320","11153320"," This could be over there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11157320","11159320"," Okay, we could clean this up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11162320","11169320"," Like if you had a high and low range, this is the high range, the low range."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11171320","11173320"," This actually changes over time too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11176320","11180320"," Something like the potential. I guess you could do a second one."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11184320","11186320"," You like a low range down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11187320","11193320"," Uh, seller is right there. Something like this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11201320","11204320"," That might be that 420 level up there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11208320","11210320"," Something like this path."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11217320","11221320"," See, uh, could be there, could be there, could be there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11222320","11226320"," It depends on as time passes, right? Like these numbers go up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11228320","11233320"," Uh, yeah, all these numbers go up and then we sell, right? Eventually sell, sell, sell down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11234320","11236320"," Anyways, something like this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11241320","11243320"," Actually bring this down, I think."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11247320","11253320"," Trade it up and then down like this. Something like that. I don't know exactly what it is right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11263320","11265320"," That's what I'm going to expect."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11277320","11281320"," All right, I'm going to take a break. I'm going to leave you guys here to it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11286320","11290320"," You guys said to say has been so fucking boring. Yep. It's consolidation."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11293320","11297320"," Yeah, you're building it in. Yeah, there's a, you could probably make the range wider too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11298320","11300320"," You'll see it firm up and, uh."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11300320","11301320"," Yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11305320","11307320"," Holy shit. At least six people showed up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11312320","11318320"," I was watching this lady at Walmart walk through the clothing section. We'll have your kids over face and candy. Oh, man."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11323320","11329320"," That's three to two and play today. No, I think three eighty two is, I think a target of, I think if you're a bear,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11329320","11334320"," you want to have a healthy target of looking at three eighty two. Doesn't matter if we actually get there or not."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11335320","11337320"," That's a matter of where you want to be positioned."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11339320","11341320"," The safest bet for a bear."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11342320","11348320"," Is to sell on a high, right? Remember that. If you're, if you're a bear, you want to, you want to sell on a high."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11348320","11351320"," If you're a bull, you want to buy in a low, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11360320","11365320"," Yeah, if you have a select. So if you're a bear, you want to sell on a high."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11366320","11368320"," You want to have a price target of thirty eight twenty."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11369320","11371320"," You want to know that you are likely not to get there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11372320","11377320"," Unless some volatility is added to the market or more, more bears are convinced."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11378320","11380320"," To buy lower, uh, puts."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11381320","11386320"," You'll find sometimes the bears will bulls do the same thing as your approach thirty eight twenty."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11387320","11392320"," They won't be buying puts for thirty seven twenty thirty six hundred."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11393320","11398320"," If you can convince bears to buy puts at thirty six hundred or lower,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11399320","11401320"," we could trade to thirty to thirty eight twenty."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11401320","11405320"," If bears start buying, just puts only for thirty eight twenty."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11405320","11409320"," We won't actually trade to it. We'll trade to the trade like thirty nine hundred."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11410320","11415320"," You need to, you need bears to like, they both say the buy lower than where you're actually trading to."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11416320","11421320"," And continue it like more outside the money puts once puts start to become more inside the money."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11421320","11423320"," The market will actually flatten out."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11426320","11430320"," Does it make sense? You won't trade to thirty twenty if everyone's buying."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11431320","11435320"," Like if everyone's buying three ninety P's, we're not going to trade to thirty twenty."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11435320","11451320"," Yeah, so this is, this is kind of like above here is positive gamma down here is negative gamma."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11451320","11462320"," I don't trust JP and his merry bit of ass is the Fed."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11462320","11466320"," I think they want to exert more control until next year, but I would love to be wrong."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11472320","11473320"," Yeah, I like."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11474320","11481320"," I think a bull unlike so people are like, what do you mean by hawkish is like, I'm like hawkish is bullish and."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11482320","11485320"," People are like, what do you mean by hawkish is bullish and."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11486320","11488320"," Dovish is bearish."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11489320","11491320"," I'm like, well, like if they."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11492320","11497320"," If they surprise with a devil statement, you're more than likely going to see a market reaction move up a big one."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11498320","11502320"," But then it would we would probably have a crash afterwards like two weeks later."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11504320","11515320"," Then I'm like, if you have a, if you have, if you got slammed with a thirty five or seventy five point rate rate increase, you'd probably see the market initially sell the fucking world."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11515320","11521320"," We'd blast, we'd blast lower initially, but you'd probably be able to buy a tradable dip down there too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11522320","11524320"," It's kind of weird because that's kind of weird."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11524320","11527320"," Like which timeframe are you talking about kind of stuff and."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11528320","11532320"," Someone on Twitter a few days ago said that I think we're up around."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11533320","11535320"," We were up around four ten or something."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11536320","11544320"," I think like last Wednesday or Thursday or something we were talking here in stream about, man, I don't want to buy for a long here at four ten."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11544320","11546320"," I'd really like to see the mark from down a little bit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11547320","11548320"," And then we started trading down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11548320","11550320"," I think Friday, Thursday, Friday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11550320","11555320"," And we're looking forward to hopefully trading down not this deep."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11555320","11557320"," That this much of a of a of a sell off."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11557320","11562320"," We weren't anticipating to be this this deep, which is outstanding for bears."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11562320","11563320"," Congratulations to bears."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11563320","11568320"," But we wanted to stay in positive gamut right trade up higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11568320","11570320"," And we didn't stay in positive gamut."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11570320","11573320"," So we're trading down below positive gamut bears open the door to lower lows."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11573320","11575320"," And then we're going to go back and forth."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11575320","11580320"," But I guess my point here is that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11580320","11584320"," There's no real pathway up unless you get some selling, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11584320","11586320"," There's no pathway to four thirty."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11586320","11589320"," There's no when we're at four ten, there was no direct path."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11589320","11593320"," Maybe close the gap at four twenty and then immediately sell back down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11593320","11596320"," Was a possible extension, but that didn't happen."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11596320","11597320"," We sold right off, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11598320","11599320"," They teed right off four ten."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11599320","11603320"," You heard Mike Williams or Wilson come out and say there's not enough room to."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11603320","11605320"," He was like, he said that yesterday on Monday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11605320","11609320"," That was one of my that's if you have a bullish case there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11609320","11613320"," One of the quotes from him on Monday was, there's not enough room."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11613320","11616320"," There's not enough juice to go up there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11616320","11618320"," Which is a fair point."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11618320","11620320"," If we're down, we're going to go back and forth."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11620320","11621320"," There's not enough room."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11621320","11624320"," There's not enough juice to go up there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11624320","11626320"," Which is a fair point."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11626320","11634320"," If we're down here at three ninety or three eighty, there's now more juice to go up to four twenty four thirty four forty."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11634320","11642320"," If you want to go to those numbers and there's like in a bank and see a five hundred point move up, they might take that just for the money."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11642320","11644320"," See what I'm saying?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11644320","11649320"," So we're at three eighty and they're like, eh, if we're at three eighty, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11649320","11653320"," And big banks like, well, how deep can we go?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11653320","11654320"," Two hundred points."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11654320","11655320"," Maybe we'll get thirty six hundred."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11655320","11658320"," Maybe we'll get, we're going to get probably get a reaction at least."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11658320","11659320"," They're like a big bank."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11659320","11661320"," You're like, eh, at thirty eight hundred."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11661320","11663320"," What are we going to get out of this?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11663320","11665320"," We're going to get a strong reaction."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11665320","11668320"," We know we're going to get a strong reaction off thirty six hundred thirty five hundred."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11668320","11671320"," You know that the fucking buyer, the algo is going to sit there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11671320","11673320"," The computer is going to sit there and just buy it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11674320","11677320"," So if we're down at thirty eight hundred."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11677320","11681320"," A guy like Mike Wilson might say, well, you know, we can always go up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11681320","11688320"," You know, three to five hundred points real quick tag all that shit and we can sell our big positions in these big companies into fucking strength."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11688320","11690320"," You guys get all that stuff."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11690320","11693320"," You guys understand that stuff?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11694320","11701320"," So you might get some leverage from a bank."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11701320","11710320"," You might get a guy like Mike Wilson or, you know, any of those guys that might help you out as a bull into a FMC."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11710320","11720320"," So if you're a bull, you're probably like, yeah, let's get, let's get some thirty eight twenty going so I can get fucking a big bank on my side to make a face ripper."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11721320","11723320"," Bears don't want to hear that do that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11723320","11725320"," They want to hear straight to the pits of hell."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11725320","11726320"," Bulls don't want to hear that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11726320","11728320"," They're like, just start going up now, Cap."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11728320","11730320"," That's just not how the market works."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11730320","11737320"," So we go up and down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11737320","11746320"," Up and down and up and down and up and down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11746320","11749320"," Yeah, Leonard's saying spy 420 by Christmas hundred percent."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11749320","11751320"," Santa and good news rally coming."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11751320","11753320"," Yeah, I can see that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11753320","11754320"," I would love that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11754320","11756320"," I'm down with that trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11756320","11757320"," I'm down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11757320","11761320"," I'm totally down with that trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11761320","11762320"," I'm totally down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11762320","11767320"," I'm definitely down with trade to 420 or 430 or 440."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11767320","11769320"," The algos are saying that that's going to happen."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","11769320","11774320"," I showed an algo yesterday that the algo doesn't believe that we're going down."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","12363320","12368320"," I think what I need to do is stop talking for a day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12368320","12372320"," Just take the rest of the day off or something. That's what I think I need to do."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12372320","12377320"," You're personally feeling traveling public."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12377320","12385320"," Yes, they got a mask up when I'm out in public places. You know what I was afraid of was I was walking up and down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12386320","12394320"," So there's these high traffic areas at ski resorts and everyone's got their hands on the handrails because they got boots on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12394320","12397320"," And then you get like all these kids with no gloves on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12397320","12407320"," They're just like dragging their hands across the handrails and I've got my gloves on, but I'm like, man, I'm fucking just picking up every other asshole's shit right now."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","12413320","12421320"," They still try to practice some kind of like."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12421320","12425320"," You know, like when there's too many people around, I don't know."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12425320","12428320"," I've been less sick to overall."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12428320","12434320"," By in like public spaces, people, I don't know that kind of shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12434320","12437320"," I haven't been in the truth is I haven't been sick in like a."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12437320","12440320"," I've been sick in three or four years now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12440320","12442320"," Not once."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12442320","12447320"," Not one time in like three or four years."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12447320","12449320"," Probably got the monkey runna."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","12460320","12461320"," Yeah, it's, it's really weird."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12461320","12464320"," People get pissed at me too with wearing a mask and I'm like, you know what?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12464320","12468320"," I'm like, I don't want you fucking coughing on me."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12468320","12471320"," So I used to live in Asia."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12471320","12474320"," And everyone there wears masks."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12474320","12477320"," And I didn't know why they did."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12477320","12482320"," And then it was explained to me that when people get sick there, they wear a mask."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12482320","12485320"," So they don't get you sick."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12486320","12489320"," Or the time that's what it was."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12489320","12493320"," So like a little bit of courtesy goes a long way, especially if you're sick, like you're sick."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12493320","12495320"," You should be wearing a fucking mask."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12495320","12498320"," I know that's not cool thing to be doing, but."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12498320","12503320"," Even if you don't believe in that, I don't care."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12503320","12506320"," Like if you don't believe in COVID or if you don't think it's that bad, I don't care."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12506320","12509320"," I'm just like a common courtesy kind of thing."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12509320","12513320"," And if you see me wearing a mask, what the fuck do you care?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12513320","12516320"," I'm not, I don't care if you wear a mask or not, to be honest with you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12516320","12520320"," But if I'm wearing one, just leave me alone."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12520320","12525320"," Well, that's what I have done."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12525320","12532320"," So I've got, I've had a couple brief interactions where I've been asked why I'm wearing a mask."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12532320","12533320"," And I just told them point blank."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12533320","12534320"," I've got COVID."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12534320","12537320"," I didn't, of course, but I have said that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12544320","12548320"," Yeah, this is pretty much the same topic that Winky's talking about, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12548320","12553320"," When you get on to like Twitter, man, in like these fucking websites, or even Reddit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12553320","12558320"," It's like they're creating this fucking like fight over stupid shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12558320","12564320"," I was looking at, you know, I was looking at the other day, or I was looking at something that showed like, um."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12564320","12569320"," There's something about fucking, you know, it's like on one side, it's like you got these fucking Nazis."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12570320","12577320"," And then the other side, you got like a very small fringe group of, um, of LGBTQ."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12577320","12583320"," And they're putting like, they're putting these really fringe elements of groups of people."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12583320","12587320"," That most people don't even know these people."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12587320","12594320"," Like you might know someone that's, um, uh, LGBTQ, but they're not, they're just normal people."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12594320","12595320"," Does it make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12595320","12599320"," You might have like a grandfather that's kind of slightly fucking racist."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12599320","12604320"," You know, and you, you know, you tolerate this, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12604320","12610320"," But you're not, it's not like you're sitting in your living room when you've got like a fucking Nazi sitting in the corner"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12610320","12615320"," and you got a fucking, you know, a militant pissed off, uh."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12615320","12621320"," You know, someone dressed in like as a, as an ultra drag queen in your, in your other living room chair."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12621320","12624320"," And you guys are fighting, duking it out."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12624320","12630320"," But yet we go on to social media and we're like screaming and yelling."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12630320","12636320"," It's bizarre, so bizarre."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12636320","12640320"," You know what I mean? There's like, it doesn't matter which side of this you're on."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","12823320","12827320"," How unhealthy that is, you know?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12827320","12833320"," If you're meant, you're like mental well-being, spirituality, all that kind of stuff."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12833320","12838320"," You ever notice, um, I was just talking to, uh,"

"_i07-eFwW4Y","12844320","12848320"," like you, when you're young, you're like, oh, I want to date crazy over there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12848320","12854320"," And so you're dated enough crazy until you find someone that you meet."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12854320","12856320"," Doesn't matter if it's a boy or girl or whatever."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12856320","12858320"," They, them, whatever, don't care."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12858320","12861320"," Uh, but you ever notice like you meet, especially when you're growing up,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12861320","12864320"," when you're like teenager, young adult into your thirties."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12864320","12868320"," Um, you ever notice you're around certain people, you're happy all the time?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12868320","12871320"," Your friends could just, it doesn't even have to be a love interest."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12871320","12873320"," Could just be a friend, even just your friends out there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12873320","12876320"," You're going to notice like some around some people and they're just always happy."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12876320","12879320"," But getting a little bit of that in your life is a real nice thing."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12879320","12881320"," It really does make life better."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","12885320","12888320"," I try to like give you guys some, some color."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12888320","12891320"," But I'm not really that guy in real life."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12891320","12892320"," It's just, it's just an image too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12892320","12894320"," It's just an image for you guys that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12894320","12896320"," Something fucking laugh about her."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12896320","12898320"," Make fun of me."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12898320","12902320"," Uh, but I was in the military and I do sail."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12902320","12903320"," So."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12903320","12907320"," Uh, those all, those all match up to all match up to who I am."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12907320","12909320"," Uh, and I do sail."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12909320","12910320"," So."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12910320","12914320"," Uh, those are all, those are all match up to all match up to who I am."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12914320","12915320"," Uh, and I do sail."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12915320","12916320"," So."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12916320","12918320"," Uh, it's just, it's just an image too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12918320","12920320"," It's just an image for you guys that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12920320","12922320"," Something fucking laugh about her."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12923320","12928320"," I can they that he does, you know it's funny too, is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12928320","12930320"," Um, we talk about our."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12930320","12935320"," Like our parents, our grandparents, our great grandparents."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12935320","12937320"," I'm like, how my dad was raised versus how I was raised."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12937320","12942320"," Now how I'm raising my children and you see like the generational"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12942320","12943320"," differences."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12943320","12945320"," And how in how you raising your kids."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12945320","12946320"," And age."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12946320","12947320"," So they're like, yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12947320","12948320"," Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12948320","12949320"," Yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12949320","12952320"," in how you're raising your kids."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12952320","12958320"," I always wonder if we'll cycle back through into that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12958320","12963320"," Like do you go through cycles where you have this function and you have less dysfunction and you have less dysfunction"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12963320","12968320"," and then all of a sudden you have one generation of just real dysfunction."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12968320","12972320"," Does that cycle restart? We don't know yet. We're wondering."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12979320","12989320"," You're working on the reversal now. Yeah, I've been that. I shouldn't say I haven't been an asshole. My job."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12989320","12994320"," My profession. I was an asshole. I'll be honest with you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12994320","12998320"," I had very high expectations."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","12998320","13005320"," I had very high demands of people and I was not well liked in my actual job itself."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13005320","13008320"," I was like worse than the human race. You didn't want to see me."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13008320","13013320"," If you saw me, if I was hired to come in to help your company, heads were rolling."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13013320","13017320"," So you were automatically were just I was automatically disliked."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13017320","13021320"," Well, not automatically."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13021320","13026320"," I was usually liked by the people I was firing. I should be honest, more not more honest, but"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13026320","13033320"," the mostly the people that liked me were going to get their heads chopped off and"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13034320","13040320"," the ones that typically didn't like me were usually the best workforce that they had."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13051320","13057320"," Yeah, it's weird and like the business that I was in, it was a sign of weakness like this, you know, businesses like that, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13058320","13067320"," You have to not so much be you can be a nice guy, but you don't want to be known as like a nice guy that can, you know, end your employment or whatever."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13067320","13072320"," They smile and as a firearm, I mean, I'm being figured to hear."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13072320","13078320"," But I was kind of a fucking asshole and I would take that shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13079320","13083320"," Or that that impacted my personal life too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13083320","13087320"," I'm so grateful that I don't have to do that stuff anymore."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13098320","13100320"," Yeah, the I'm an asshole song."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13100320","13104320"," That was part of my job. Well, you know, it wasn't part of my job. It was that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13105320","13110320"," My job where it wasn't being an asshole, but it was."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13112320","13117320"," A serious job that required serious attention and."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13119320","13125320"," Usually people were business owners were in that position where they needed that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13126320","13136320"," Like, like do or die, right? Your business is going to go bankrupt. You don't have a choice here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13136320","13144320"," We keep things, you know, the publicly keep things a public persona being nice, but."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13144320","13150320"," There were some very ruthless things people had to do to become profitable."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13155320","13160320"," Yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13160320","13165320"," Man, what talk about a sideways market?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13165320","13170320"," Consolidation. Not a whole lot going on here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13170320","13175320"," Just consolidation. We're talking about this yesterday into the bell."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13175320","13179320"," We're talking about what to expect this upcoming next for the rest of the week."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13179320","13184320"," And I was like, man, I was like, they could fucking they could pin this shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13184320","13189320"," Like these dealers, I mean, not that that's going to happen. We can make a move today, but."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13189320","13195320"," They could pin this fucking market for days if they wanted to be really good."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13195320","13204320"," Good thing we took the, took the print up here, huh?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13204320","13207320"," Did you guys all take the print with me up here on the opening bell, the calls?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13207320","13211320"," Did you guys get, did you guys monetize these calls up here?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13211320","13220320"," This morning."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13220320","13227320"," So glad I took profit in here, man. I'm like, oh, this nonsense in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13227320","13230320"," Probably waiting for the Robinhooders."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13230320","13235320"," Who can't trade after, what is it? 230 or 330? Then they'll make the move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13235320","13240320"," I feel like Robinhooders with like their zero day calls. Can you imagine me in a Robinhooder right now?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13240320","13245320"," I can't even, I can't even. So like, so they're like."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13245320","13253320"," CBOE, CBOE is like, okay, we're going to introduce zero dates now and you can't trade them."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13253320","13264320"," We now have OpEx five days a week and fuck you Robinhooders."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13264320","13269320"," Do you imagine being a Robinhooder and being like, I can't even trade this stuff."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13269320","13277320"," So Biden risks 2023 dead stand off as GOP digs in and according and Democrats wait."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13277320","13284320"," So again, Biden risks 2023 dead stand off as GOP digs in and Democrats wait."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13284320","13289320"," What you saying there, Garrett? Oh, you're, are you Robinhooder?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13289320","13291320"," Yeah, that would suck. You got to get out of there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13291320","13295320"," There's if any of you guys are on Robinhood."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13295320","13302320"," At least if I guess if there was a graduated step, I'm testing out this dream is sponsored by to the tick."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13302320","13315320"," I do have some news for you guys, but I don't want to break the news to you yet just yet."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13316320","13327320"," But I have been reached out to and I've reached out to companies that I've used and companies are interested in using."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13327320","13333320"," If they, if they, if they're server, if their services suck, I'm never going to talk to you, but I'm saying maybe it's better."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13333320","13344320"," They don't say anything specifically, but I am trying to find if I've been people have been reaching out to me."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13345320","13347320"," So."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13347320","13354320"," If that happens, we'll try to, we'll try to find something to get you out of Robinhood trade somewhere else."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13354320","13356320"," We'll do something."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13360320","13366320"," I don't think that you can on Robinhood unless they change that real recently."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13366320","13370320"," I don't think that you can trade zero date options."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13371320","13378320"," I think I don't know if you can, I think you can buy them in the morning, but you can't or you have to sell out of them by 230 or 330."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13378320","13388320"," Correct me if I'm wrong on that, but I think I've been told by people that you can't, you can close them, you can't open them."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13388320","13390320"," So the problem with zero dates."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13390320","13392320"," So let me explain this better."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13392320","13396320"," I think I know I think I got this right. Not positive on this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13396320","13402320"," So, so you could correct me if I'm wrong on this, but this is what I think the Robinhood."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13402320","13406320"," Let's say it's a 230 in the afternoon."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13406320","13408320"," Could be 330."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13408320","13411320"," But let's say right here, this is 230 in the afternoon, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13411320","13415320"," So let's say you bought some zero dates."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13415320","13420320"," Zero date calls, let's just say you did about some zero dates right here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13421320","13426320"," So your position, we start to do this kind of a thing."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13426320","13428320"," And now we're down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13428320","13432320"," I think at the rep higher to the bell, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13432320","13440320"," You're in a zero date position here and wanted to add to your position because you're upside down in it now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13440320","13442320"," I don't think that you could add to your position."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13442320","13447320"," And I don't think you could open a new position here on zero date specifically."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13447320","13451320"," And I don't think you can even trade a mat between four and four, fifteen."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13451320","13454320"," I could be wrong on this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13454320","13462320"," So like a most on most trading platforms, you can trade until open and close until four, fifteen."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13462320","13465320"," Let me know if I'm wrong on that, but I think that I'm right on that one."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13465320","13469320"," So there's some like mechanical issues with trading the stock market in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13469320","13473320"," And it's kind of like a super sketchy."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13473320","13476320"," There's another there's an impact on that too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13476320","13480320"," If you can't if you can't do anything but close in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13480320","13484320"," And the position is going against you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13484320","13489320"," It could they could trigger like some kind of like be fearful, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13489320","13492320"," You'll never recover your position unless you add to it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13492320","13494320"," There's like, I think that's right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13494320","13498320"," It could be wrong on that, but let me know if I'm wrong on that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13498320","13506320"," Okay, so yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13506320","13510320"," I think that's right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13510320","13511320"," Yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13511320","13517320"," I don't think you can trade a mat, but can you guys open and close by contracts at four o'clock."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","13518320","13523320"," You like one Robin Hood by a call at four o'clock and sell it at four, fifteen."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13523320","13525320"," I don't think you can."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13526320","13530320"," Okay, yeah, so there are some rules."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13530320","13536320"," There shouldn't be any rules, but there are."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13536320","13540320"," That complicates your mentality is too right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13540320","13544320"," I would I would assume that that would wait if I was trading Robin Hood zero dates."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13544320","13548320"," I'd be like, oh, they have horrible fills in Robin Hood too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13548320","13550320"," Horrible."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13551320","13555320"," I don't know that I would trade zero dates in Robin Hood, if I could."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13555320","13559320"," If I had a Robin Hood count with money, I don't know if I would want to."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13559320","13565320"," You're like talking about three, like three cents and five cents matters."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13565320","13570320"," I don't like how it's, I don't like how the website is set up either."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","13590320","13594320"," You might not be able to sell spreads, but you can at least open."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13594320","13597320"," Or buy complex spreads."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13600320","13601320"," On Robin Hood."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13602320","13611320"," It's even still like the way the layout of their, just the layout of like buying and selling and then watching the Greeks on your."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13611320","13615320"," And then then how you watch the options chain."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13616320","13617320"," It's kind of bizarre."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","13649320","13652320"," But I'm only looking at that stuff in the background, not probably."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","13691320","13693320"," You can open like five, 10 accounts."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13693320","13695320"," So you can sign in and out of them."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13695320","13701320"," So if you place a trade, let's say you place like a call spread for three months, you can just put it on one of your accounts."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13701320","13703320"," And you're not staring at it every day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13703320","13708320"," You're not like it's not right in front of your face, especially like long trades."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13708320","13711320"," Or not long like long market or long position."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13711320","13713320"," If you're like, Oh, I'm going to put something on for a year."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13713320","13716320"," I'm going to put something on or you're going to buy stock."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","13727320","13730320"," I want to know if it goes to $8 or $20."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13730320","13733320"," And you set alerts on them and you forget about it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13733320","13735320"," I can't stand."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13736320","13741320"," I can't stand if I have a, if I have like a."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13744320","13748320"," I believe in a position where it's going unless it breaks a certain number."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13748320","13749320"," I don't want to."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13749320","13751320"," I don't want to look at it every day."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","13755320","13759320"," Or at least alerts me as it gets close to a cell opportunity."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13759320","13760320"," You can do that too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13760320","13762320"," I used to have done that in the past."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13765320","13767320"," But like look staring and looking at that shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13767320","13768320"," I can't do it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13768320","13769320"," I get crazy."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13769320","13771320"," I'll start overthinking it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13772320","13773320"," Yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13773320","13776320"," I like a, you should not, if you're going to do GME stuff like that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13776320","13781320"," And if you ever afraid of that stuff, you want to use a prime bank for those trades."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13781320","13783320"," You want to use like a."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13783320","13785320"," Schwab or."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13785320","13786320"," Yeah."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","13787320","13794320"," Yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13794320","13795320"," Yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13795320","13796320"," Yeah."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","13802320","13807320"," With a real bank behind it because they can cover that liquidity issue."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13807320","13809320"," Problem that Robin had another."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13809320","13811320"," Order for sellers have."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13811320","13814320"," And then the other thing to think about is a."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13814320","13818320"," The thing about is the customer service support."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13818320","13826320"," I'm telling you, if you trade any, if you ever trade any size, if you don't do it now, you don't trade size and you ever do."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13827320","13829320"," You're going to need customer service at some point."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13829320","13832320"," When you're trading size."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13832320","13835320"," If anything goes wrong."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13839320","13841320"," You want someone there to talk to."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13841320","13844320"," That's one thing I can give her tasty man."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13844320","13846320"," I'm not affiliated with them in any way, shape or form."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13846320","13849320"," And one thing I can give to tasty is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13849320","13852320"," If I have an issue, they answered the phone."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13852320","13855320"," It doesn't matter what time of day it is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13856320","13859320"," I get somebody who knows my accounts, manages my accounts."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13859320","13862320"," And they know who I am."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13862320","13863320"," So."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13863320","13870320"," I don't know if your broker offers you good customer service like your phone call."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13870320","13872320"," Two, three rings pick it up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13872320","13874320"," 9 30 in the morning."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13874320","13876320"," We're there for you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13876320","13879320"," That's the if there was one thing to give tasty."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13879320","13881320"," I know there are other good brokers that do that too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13881320","13884320"," So if you know any other good burgers that have good customer service."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13885320","13888320"," You can't do that with Robinhood."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13888320","13892320"," You're not calling Robinhood and speaking to somebody."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13892320","13900320"," Well, that's the thing."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13900320","13902320"," So like."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13902320","13904320"," It's like a prime bank."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13904320","13908320"," You only want to use them for buying and selling of physical stock."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13908320","13911320"," I'm not talking about trading options with."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13912320","13913320"," So like GME."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13913320","13916320"," If you're going to buy and sell GME."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13916320","13919320"," You don't want liquidity issues."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13919320","13924320"," I'm talking about physical shares or stock."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13928320","13930320"," But trade options."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13930320","13935320"," I had I had zero problems trading options."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13935320","13936320"," UK chance."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13937320","13939320"," To protect mortgage holders."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13939320","13943320"," Matter of fact, remember that time in Robinhood was like they were banning stocks."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13943320","13946320"," It was like they were just like with like three stocks in the day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13946320","13947320"," And so you can't trade these."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13947320","13949320"," You can't trade those closing only these positions."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13949320","13952320"," And they were like rotating through a bunch of."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13952320","13956320"," A bunch of pump or not pumping up, but mean stocks."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13956320","13958320"," At that time, I was."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13958320","13959320"," Okay, Chancellor Hunt."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13959320","13962320"," They're saying CEOs are recommitted to protect mortgage holders."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13963320","13967320"," Matter of fact, there was a window in the wind Russia."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13967320","13969320"," Russia stocks were going down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13969320","13971320"," Tasty was."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13971320","13973320"," Tasty a lot."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13973320","13975320"," It allows you to actually hear water flowing futures."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13975320","13977320"," Nice little part of the market right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13977320","13978320"," Nice little."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13978320","13983320"," You could trade the Russia stocks for like an extra."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13983320","13986320"," I don't know if it was an extra four hours or an extra eight hours."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13986320","13989320"," Tasty was still trading."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13989320","13992320"," You're like one of the last."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","13992320","14000320"," Brokers to go down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14000320","14001320"," They do."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14001320","14003320"," So the event is the saying that Robinhood now is phone customer service."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14003320","14004320"," What did you what?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14004320","14006320"," What was your experience?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14006320","14007320"," When you called, did they help you?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14007320","14015320"," Well, they fix your issues."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14015320","14018320"," Yeah, I pay for my trades, man."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14019320","14034320"," I love Tasty."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14034320","14035320"," I don't know."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14035320","14043320"," The finance ministry says banking CEOs are recommitted to enable customers to switch to new fixed rate mortgages or has a new affordability test."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14043320","14048320"," I think the natural progression for someone that uses Robinhood, probably they're failed."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14048320","14051320"," They'll feel the safest with Webull."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14051320","14056320"," I would I would think like the next step for a new trader is probably Webull."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14056320","14061320"," You're like, Oh, I don't feel comfortable."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14061320","14065320"," Webull is probably the next logical step."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14066320","14073320"," If in reality, if you had the chance choice, what I would do is I would open up a bunch of different."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14073320","14076320"," I would open up like accounts of Tasty Webull."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14076320","14079320"," I would open them up at, um, I don't know."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14079320","14081320"," TD Ameritrade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14081320","14083320"," I think you're swam accounts."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14083320","14084320"," I would just open a bunch."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14084320","14086320"," You don't, you don't have to fund them all."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14086320","14088320"," Um, some you do."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14088320","14089320"," There's, uh,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14090320","14096320"," There's some accounts where you have to come up with like 15, 20 grand, 30 grand futures accounts."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14096320","14101320"," Uh, you have to find most futures accounts, but cash market equity."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14101320","14115320"," I think you don't think banks have agreed to specific help to specifically help to mortgage borrowers and including extending a loan or lowering monthly payments to just repeat their banks have agreed to offer specific help to mortgage borrowers,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14115320","14120320"," including extending a loan or lowering monthly payments."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14120320","14126320"," Yeah, I think, um,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14126320","14130320"," I think that I can, I can understand the mobile experience of Robinhood."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14130320","14134320"," I don't think Robinhood is necessarily bad if you're buying and selling stock."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14134320","14138320"," Or if you're, or if you're, if you're holding positions where it's not timing is not critical."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14138320","14142320"," So if you're like, I bought some call spreads and."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14142320","14147320"," You know, I can close them whenever and I can just pop Robinhood open and do my thing. I think that's fine."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14147320","14154320"," I think if you're, I think if you're timing of your trade, if you're timing your trades."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14154320","14160320"," If you're like, so like if you're here with me and you're like, we're like, okay, what we're going to do is we're going to take."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14160320","14164320"," We're going to buy some some spy calls here and we're going to sell them right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14164320","14170320"," I would be there's no way you're getting a better experience doing this in Robinhood than."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14170320","14175320"," I am right here where I'm standing with my taste the open. There's no way."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14175320","14182320"," No way you're getting a better full fill and there's no way you're getting faster execution and there's no way that Robinhood you can."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14182320","14185320"," There's no way that you can track on Robinhood."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14185320","14190320"," Uh, how to get into any positions quickly or add to your positions quickly or close them all quickly."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14190320","14192320"," No way."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14192320","14199320"," No way you beat the speed of the, uh, but that's, but that's, you'd have, I'm talking about trading on a laptop or a desktop."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14199320","14204320"," Two, I'm not talking about trading on a phone."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14204320","14210320"," Taste these, uh, phone app kind of sucks."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14210320","14216320"," I'll say that it does kind of suck, but I don't trade by phone."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14216320","14220320"," I trade, I always trade at a desk."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14220320","14225320"," Yeah, that's what I'm saying."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14226320","14236320"," I can see, I can see Robinhood's place, but then in like really fast markets or really fast directional moves."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14236320","14239320"," I don't know. I'd be scared to death."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14239320","14245320"," I'd be scared."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14245320","14252320"," No, this is a weebel. So, um, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try everything if I go out there and I'll try stuff."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14252320","14258320"," And if I like it, I'll use it. So, uh, market data is expensive cost a lot of money."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14258320","14267320"," Um, and then every, every, like, you know, um, the book map has its own, uh, data that you have to pay for."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14267320","14274320"," Um, you can't, well, you can pay for different types of some data is free and some data you pay and you pay more for more data."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14274320","14279320"," Um, sometimes your trading app will have good data or you have to pay for data,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14279320","14285320"," but the app might suck or the charting might suck. Like I prefer research on trading view."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14285320","14288320"," Um, live market data."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14288320","14293320"," I love the speed of weebel, a love book map."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14293320","14299320"," Um, for executing my trades, I like, execute them and tasty. So I use different."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14299320","14306320"," Uh, software for different, uh, things that I'm trying to do. Like there might be like something that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14306320","14311320"," That, um, trading view does very well. And then something that book map does very well."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14311320","14320320"," Light speed might do something very well. I still use options AI to set up fast trades. I don't trade there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14320320","14326320"," Uh, but I have used them to quickly figure out."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14326320","14329320"," Uh,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14330320","14337320"," How much they can make on a trade or I use it for research to like I'll sometimes post options dot AI, um,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14337320","14340320"," graphs on on Twitter."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14340320","14341320"," Um,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14341320","14348320"," Just to get people an idea. Hey, this is an idea what can happen if you take this trade if it was right now at this moment."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14348320","14356320"," Um, so I think every service has their really shiny parts, right? You're like, they do this very well."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14357320","14363320"," Right. It's the same thing. Like positive, like spot gamma. We were talking about some of the negatives about spot gamma."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14363320","14370320"," Spot gamma has got some great stuff. Like I can't, I can't say spot gamma doesn't have some great stuff."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14370320","14376320"," Makes like all these different services. They put it. They were where they shine. If you can take that and use it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14376320","14380320"," So the reason why I use weebel with you guys is number one, it's free data."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14381320","14390320"," But number two, I've run it against, um, paid data and it's maybe three milliseconds slower."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14390320","14397320"," But for free data charts, they're probably the fastest out there. It's like where weebel."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14397320","14401320"," Uh, isn't the best like weebels. Um,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14401320","14406320"," What do they call their drawing sets and drawing drawing charts? They kind of suck, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14406320","14412320"," It's really basic, right? Uh, what they would like their tools and stuff. Yeah, they're really kind of sketchy."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14412320","14421320"," Uh, but market information. If you were to just, if you have five or six screeners at home and you throw up a just a simple candlestick chart."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14421320","14428320"," Um, and you're not paying for that data of weebel all day long. Probably the best free data."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14428320","14430320"," Uh, that you can get."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14431320","14435320"," Uh, in terms of, um, speed."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14435320","14445320"," Speed in which that data is made available to you. I don't know, I don't know how they're paying for it and I don't know why they're not charging people for it, but it's fucking awesome."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14445320","14453320"," You know, for everything that weebel sucks, weebel kind of sucks, but they're, they're, they're data feed is outstanding. Outfucking standing."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14453320","14456320"," I'd put it up against any paid data."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14461320","14470320"," Yeah, I didn't know that they were moving chat in a month. So are they removing a, are they going to remove? Who's the guy that's the trader on in the morning?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14470320","14479320"," So thinkorswim used to have trade the news. They got, they dumped that, right? Then they have trade the news and then they dumped it. They used to offer it for free."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14479320","14486320"," You can you still pay for trade the news on? I didn't even think of that. I have to go check that out and see if I can buy it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14487320","14494320"," I know they used to have free trade the news. It was, I think it was like a small delay, like five seconds or something or 10 seconds."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14494320","14499320"," Floyd's garage or masking you specifically. If you know."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14499320","14505320"," And thinkorswim used to have that guy on in the morning. They getting rid of him too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14505320","14515320"," What's his name? He has, he has, he has a trading show. He's, isn't he on to like 10 30 in the morning or 10 45 or 11 30."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14516320","14521320"," Yeah, shadow trader. That's not shadow trader though. Is it, is that like his partner or something?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14521320","14528320"," Isn't there like two of them? No, no, not Peter. I know who, I know who Peter is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14528320","14535320"," Good afternoon, Omar. I thought I know Peter, right? Yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14535320","14542320"," Yeah, Peter residents check. I know who he is, but I thought there's another guy that was on there in the morning that wasn't Peter."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14543320","14552320"," Or is that Peter? Are they still doing a morning audio show or are you, are you saying they're canceling their morning audio show?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14559320","14564320"," Yeah, Brad or scooter. Are they going to cancel all of their morning shows or are they keeping that aspect?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14565320","14572320"," You want to take a look at GME?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14572320","14581320"," You all want to take a look at GME? If GME rips here, you should see the spy rep. Do you guys know that?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14581320","14588320"," Have you guys been correlating? Let's take, let's do something really cool right now. So you've got, um,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14589320","14596320"," you've got James rolling 17 in the house right now, joining us, stopping by to say hello. He's asking us if we're going to buy GME."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14596320","14602320"," So we're going to do, we're going to do some clip and want to do. Um, and I haven't done it. So,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14604320","14608320"," maybe, maybe James can, James, you want to tell us what's up? Like what's."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14612320","14614320"," Holy shit, they're canceling it all."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14619320","14625320"," Yeah, is that Ben's recording when the flash crash in 2010? That was great recording, by the way."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14627320","14633320"," That is canceling. They've been here all day, James. Right on. Um,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14634320","14643320"," okay, so let's look at us. Let me see if we can find a correlation here. There's been some talk recently of, um,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14644320","14652320"," I don't know what they were doing with it. Someone was talking about some correlation between spy and GME or AMC."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14654320","14658320"," And I don't know what it is. I've been meaning to look at it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14658320","14673320"," Wait a minute. Hold on here. AMC GME same scale."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14673320","14678320"," And AMC same scale. See if you can find a kind of correlation. Let's look."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14689320","14695320"," Oh, they've been correlating more than they haven't been, right? That's what it seems like."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14698320","14701320"," Look at those spikes right there, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14706320","14708320"," Giant moves right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14711320","14714320"," Let's see if we can go on a, um,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14718320","14723320"," do you know what I mean?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14723320","14728320"," Am I buying? They, they're kind of correlating with the market now. These did not correlate."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14728320","14734320"," Jimmy and AMC used to go up when the market was going down. Guys, remember that?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14738320","14745320"," More violent moves now too, right? Deeper, deeper moves. I mean, that could be really bad for GME."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14746320","14749320"," How low is Jimmy right now?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14753320","14755320"," Big moves though, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14765320","14773320"," This is what I would say to you then. If this more correlated moves in GME, James, I would say to you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14774320","14779320"," What we've been talking about here past the one here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14781320","14785320"," So into the bottoming process yesterday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14786320","14793320"," We were saying it's possible or we don't know when the shorts will come off for a squeeze higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14796320","14801320"," You're going to expect something between now and Saturday. So."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14802320","14808320"," Uh, I would think so the smart money is down here on the spy."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14810320","14812320"," Smart money is down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14814320","14817320"," Uh, I don't know if this by the smart money by was down here or not."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14818320","14824320"," What I would recommend is doing an overlay where I would, I would be looking at the spy for some weakness."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14825320","14826320"," For the rest of the week."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14827320","14834320"," If, if we don't tag our one, right? Does he, does he be the rules, right? If we don't tag our one today directly."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14835320","14842320"," If we don't grind up and hit our one, I would say to you look for, um, at least some moments."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14843320","14850320"," Between now and Monday, if we can get down here without hitting our one, if we sell off and bleed off at any point."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14851320","14856320"," Uh, I'd be a buyer of GME and I'd be buying calls that are dated for Monday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14858320","14860320"," It doesn't mean we don't go there right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14861320","14865320"," Uh, the rule, my rule here would be that you wait for this here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14869320","14871320"," Seems like there's more correlation with GME now, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14875320","14877320"," Maybe I'm missing what you're saying."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14881320","14889320"," So you found out that, uh, Sederon's GME shares."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14890320","14895320"," Uh, so you guys can go back and check my Twitter history. I was in."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14896320","14900320"," So before GME was anything, um."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14901320","14908320"," It was, it was like the end of the golden age for this just coming into the end of the golden age."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14909320","14915320"," For a Wall Street bets and, uh, it was a really, really tight group of people."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14917320","14921320"," And, uh, regular regular, um, it was a, it was a great community."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14923320","14924320"," That's no other way to say it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14924320","14930320"," You have like groups cycle in and out of that community, but there was a core group of probably 3000 people that were active."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14931320","14939320"," Day or daily users, three to 5000 people. I mean, there's more people in the group in Wall Street bets at that point in time, but, um."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14942320","14945320"," It's all changed the whole different thing now, but you're talking about."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14951320","14952320"," It was really wild and that happened."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14953320","14958320"," I have a lot of feelings and thoughts and emotions about it because so much has changed with, um."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14960320","14966320"," So much has changed. I remember when we were here at $21. I remember we're at $25. Remember we're at $12."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14970320","14973320"," Yeah, it's a historical place, right? It's most certainly is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14974320","14982320"," Like four bucks right here. I remember this original pump, man. Not this pump. Hold on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14983320","14988320"," It was like, started, we started laughing like rips in the previous year and like the."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14990320","14992320"," There was like a coffin of, um."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14993320","14995320"," Hey, man, maybe these guys are right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","14996320","14997320"," You know."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15000320","15001320"," Uh."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15003320","15016320"," This is before anyone knew anything, like it was such a small community and then."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15017320","15026320"," I remember being on Twitter and when the, when the original rise happened, I remember Twitter bros were like."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15029320","15031320"," I remember like somewhere back in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15032320","15038320"," There was another rip. I think before. Yeah, right up in here. There was one way back in December."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15039320","15043320"," This was like where the original excitement started and, uh."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15044320","15050320"," If I don't kind of, kind of this wrong, but I think there was like the initial rip and then it came back down and people got really fucking scared in Wall Street, but."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15051320","15053320"," And then I remember when it started ripping further along."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15056320","15059320"," I remember we were posted on Twitter and we were like."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15060320","15064320"," This is before it got picked up by any news for anyone picked up for there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15065320","15067320"," Anybody in Wall Street bets for anything happened."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15068320","15073320"," And I remember like the people were getting trapped in here and they were like, uh, where's where's it going to go to."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15076320","15077320"," And we knew then."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15078320","15083320"," We knew before the public knew we knew before the fucking newspapers knew before the fucking."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15084320","15089320"," And see NBC didn't matter before fucking there was no apes. There was no like none of that stuff."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15091320","15097320"," And we, and I think I think as I remember it, people were like asking like, well, how high can it go cap? And I was like, oh."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15099320","15101320"," I was like, there's no ceiling. They put a ceiling on it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15102320","15107320"," Uh, there is a ceiling now, uh, but at the time there wasn't and, uh."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15108320","15112320"," We were like, they're going to have to shut it down. There's no, they're going to have no choice."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15113320","15114320"," People thought we were crazy then."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15115320","15120320"," It was like, there was like people were making, then they started making fun of people that were long in GMA."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15120320","15122320"," And we all knew we were all like, Oh, no, this fucking thing."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15123320","15125320"," This thing is going to pull a fucking Volkswagen."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15126320","15130320"," Like this thing is going to pull a fucking Volkswagen hands fucking down or they're going to shut the fucking stock down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15131320","15132320"," And people were like, Oh, I can't go."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15132320","15137320"," And people were like, Oh, I was like, I don't know, 100 bucks. And people were like, is that the highest? I'm like, nah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15138320","15145320"," What do you want? What are we going to throw out there? 300 500,000 2,000 3,000 dollars? They have no way to shut the shit down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15147320","15151320"," And people were like, you're fucking crazy. It's not true. And I'm like, no, no, no, we get this guy. It's like teaching us all this shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15152320","15153320"," If I can."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15154320","15158320"," There's no way for them to stop it. It's a fucking runaway runaway train."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15159320","15161320"," And then people didn't believe it. And then as it started running up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15162320","15168320"," I remember like, I remember like in here somewhere."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15169320","15173320"," People are like, there's no fucking way it's getting up here. And like, I remember what was coming down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15174320","15179320"," Like people on Twitter that started getting angry. Like all these fucking Twitter bros are like, say never happening."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15181320","15183320"," And I'm like, Oh, it's happening."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15184320","15186320"," I'm like, there's nothing stopping this fucking train."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15187320","15190320"," Nothing. Do you guys know the whole like Volkswagen story?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15193320","15195320"," I knew we knew about the Volkswagen story back here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15196320","15198320"," We knew exactly what was going to happen here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15199320","15202320"," And we knew that there was nothing they could do unless they shut it down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15204320","15208320"," And then by the time you're in here, like this day when this was going on, this shit that was going on in here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15209320","15210320"," And then dude, it wasn't the end."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15212320","15213320"," Right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15215320","15218320"," And then it just started blasting up again. People were like, this isn't going to happen again."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15219320","15226320"," As a matter of fact, in here, if you go back to like Twitter history, these fucking people in here, like Twitter was like, Oh, good."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15227320","15229320"," We can get back to regular trading again. This is never happening again."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15230320","15234320"," And it fucking slammed back up again and fucking slammed back up again."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15237320","15241320"," And then it fucking ramped up. It was just fucking pure insanity."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15242320","15248320"," Pure fucking insanity. Just look at this fucking monster moves."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15250320","15254320"," 204. Look at that. Just fucking beast mode in it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15256320","15260320"," So yeah, this is an important place. It is very important place."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15261320","15265320"," I would trade it against the spy. I wouldn't believe anything. The hair out there. It's going to rip again."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15266320","15268320"," It'll be a nice little rip coming up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15269320","15285320"," But dude, it was crazy because no one, if you, so if you were one of maybe, you were probably like one of maybe three to 5000 people that knew all of it, then there was like maybe another 10 to 15,000 people."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15285320","15290320"," It was really weird of the three to 5000 people there was like, I wasn't, I was on the, I don't believe this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15290320","15296320"," I was like, we'll make it a trip 20. This is early, right? We make it 20. Then we got, I think we got 23 or 25 or something."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15297320","15301320"," And everybody's like, I'm taking the money and running. And then, of course, we start ramping amongst the group."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15301320","15305320"," Now you've got like 3000 people that are like, I think we can, I think this guy's got a point."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15305320","15312320"," We're going to fucking rip it up, right? But you're still totally talking like three 5000 people in the world that knows this is happening."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15312320","15322320"," And then, and then even when we started ramp, like we even when GME started ramping, you're talking about like a cacophony of people that are not even with you. They're just against you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15322320","15325320"," We don't even have apes yet. We just have people saying no."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15325320","15331320"," And that's the crazy part about that top when it started ramping up to that 500 fucking dollars at that point."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15331320","15333320"," It was over."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15333320","15339320"," It was over two reasons. They were going to definitely, they were definitely going to make it over."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15339320","15346320"," They were, oh, it's already turned like GME's already turning around. You guys see that right now? Look at that GME."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15346320","15351320"," 2197 big old bounce down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15351320","15364320"," It was so wild because if you were, if you knew, if so, if you already knew the entire story, if you'd watched the videos, if you had been in the conversations in Wall Street bets, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15364320","15372320"," And then, of course, you've got the, like, then seeing it involved, like seeing, like, the down talking that this ain't going any higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15372320","15379320"," And then, yeah, people get getting all people that don't know it. People don't know why it's going up. People don't even know why it's not going to stop."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15379320","15388320"," People are coming up with all these crazy fucking lunatic answer. Like, and these are like smart people, like hedge funds telling you this isn't going to happen."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15388320","15396320"," And people listening to hedge funds, the smart money on Twitter saying, don't listen to the listen to that hedge fund. Don't listen to these fucking crazy kids."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15396320","15404320"," And this, this isn't no apes. This isn't like, there's no 15,000. There's no 50,000. There's no million people. This is like three to 5,000 people."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15404320","15408320"," That's it. That's it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15408320","15417320"," Now, that's not the five when I hit 500. This was like the ramp into $100, right? And then it comes back down. It's like pulsing, beating."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15417320","15421320"," And we're like, they have no idea what's coming. We're like, they have no fucking clue."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15421320","15434320"," If you, if you guys, if any of you guys traded GME from the beginning, when it was under sub 100 bucks, do you have no fucking idea? You'd be sitting in there, be sitting in the fucking options chain, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15434320","15445320"," And as it would fucking, it would just fucking shut down, start back up. And you could like slam fucking 20 grand in there. And it would just fucking go whoosh."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15445320","15454320"," There was nothing like it. There was nothing like it. It was the most heart pounding, fucking crazy."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15454320","15466320"," And do people in the beginning of it, people were like, they'd go in with like 10 grand or 20 grand. It would go down. You're fucking, you'd go down to like, it'd be worth like five grand thousand bucks and then rocket ship up to $100,000."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15466320","15474320"," And you initially people were like, Oh, should I just last 19 grand? I'm going to close my position."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15474320","15481320"," I was like, boom, I just lost 19 grand. But then you'd be looking at the options chain and we'll go back up to 100 grand. You're like, Holy fuck if I had just held."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15481320","15491320"," So you just go in there as it's rampant and you're like, I don't care where I fucking buy. I know that mother fucker is going to go up another fucking, you know, 3000% in the next 15 minutes."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15491320","15495320"," That's true. That really happened."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15495320","15506320"," It was like a ramp of like, went from like 3000 to 15,000 people and then it just started exponentially fucking like, you know, you're talking about 300,000 people, million people, 5 million people that spread and fire around the world."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15506320","15515320"," And, you know, if you were there in the beginning, but as they were coming into that 500, it was already talk of they're going to shut the shit down and Wall Street bets."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15515320","15528320"," There's like an inflot of people subscribing to Wall Street bets, right? No one knew who anybody was. And then it was like, it was really bizarre to because it was like, and this is my, or at least how I recall it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15528320","15532320"," I could be wrong in some of this stuff. This is my perception of what was going on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15532320","15542320"," I remember that I was like, they're going to shut it down. They know, and it's only going to take at the time. I think I was like, maybe in a week or three days or five days, they're going to figure it out."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15542320","15549320"," And they're going to light everybody and tell them it's not going up in the background. They're going to shut this shit down. And that first time they shut it down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15549320","15552320"," That was the end."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15552320","15561320"," And for me, that's when it was over. That's when I walked away and it got crazier crazy with people get crazy with movement."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15562320","15571320"," Oh, geez, they're in Wall Street, but that's we're telling people not fucking chase GME. People would come into the sub be like, I'm this, I'm that big war started."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15571320","15575320"," I remember when they started calling each other apes and all that shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15575320","15580320"," They do original apes. They were shit on. They were shit on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15580320","15586320"," Until they overpowered the sub, the subreddit. Sorry, that's what it was. That is the truth."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15587320","15593320"," This is before the rise of the of the apes."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15593320","15603320"," So anyways, it's not that we didn't believe in it. It was that the you had two different classes of people."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15603320","15611320"," They had the people that like were original, and then of course the apes hate the original GME gang because"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15611320","15619320"," which I understand why because it became a movement for people became a fight against the power became a fight against order flow."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15619320","15628320"," Came a fight against everything that's wrong with the stock market. Everything's wrong with money, right? For people savings for people."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15628320","15637320"," Raised larger issues, social issues, economic, socioeconomic issues, social class issues, all that kind of stuff."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15637320","15642320"," The fake market, manipulative market, all that kind of stuff raised a whole bunch of legitimate answers."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15642320","15647320"," Or raised a whole bunch of legitimate concerns, but."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15647320","15654320"," So now, of course, the original GME gang was like, we're out of here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15654320","15663320"," And most still hold positions in GME, believe it or not."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15664320","15674320"," There are a lot of GME holders to this day that hold right around some. I know some guys held it like five or six, some had it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15674320","15679320"," Twelve dollars, another big number, sixteen dollars, a big number and twenty one dollars, I think."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15679320","15685320"," Twenty five dollars was another big number for the original people that were buying GME."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15685320","15689320"," So they are significant levels for OG holders."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15690320","15693320"," That never sold."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15693320","15699320"," Dude, there were times people were showing their holdings. They were like, people are just posting snapshots, like,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15699320","15708320"," like, immigrants of their holdings at those low prices. It was really wild."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15708320","15712320"," You were there, you were too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15712320","15716320"," They took over almost, that was the day that was the day Wall Street Bets died."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15717320","15719320"," That was the day Wall Street Bets died."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15719320","15722320"," In my view. I know some of you guys don't think it ever died."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15722320","15728320"," In my view that it's funny too, because the mods will always be like, you know, every three or four years we hear that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15728320","15734320"," You know, it's not the same Wall Street Bets as it as it was in the past. And it did change over over time."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15734320","15740320"," But of all the years of Wall Street Bets, to me, that was the time that was when Wall Street Bets died."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15740320","15743320"," It was a very sad moment. It was too many people."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15743320","15745320"," Too, just too many people."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15745320","15747320"," Too many people."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15756320","15761320"," It became absurd. And it was wild too. If you were there in the beginning, right? The absolute beginning."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15761320","15764320"," What was most wild about it was."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15764320","15767320"," It was rejected."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15767320","15769320"," It was rejected from normal people."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15770320","15775320"," The concept of this was, even when it started to ramp, it was rejected from people."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15775320","15778320"," It was rejected by, dude, you had high fall or Twitter accounts that were rejecting it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15778320","15781320"," It was like everybody was rejecting this. Like, no, no, no, no."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15781320","15789320"," And as it started to snowball and snowball and snowball and snowball, you watching like people switch and roll in."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15789320","15795320"," And it was really, it was, it wasn't like a bad or good. It was just very."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15796320","15803320"," I think the experience was like, like a Twilight Zone episode or something in real life."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15803320","15807320"," If you're, if you're, if you're privy and witness to it happening."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15807320","15813320"," From the absolute beginning, it was really bizarre. It was a really bizarre thing to watch."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15817320","15821320"," No, it hasn't been the same. They've tried. I think recently."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15822320","15826320"," I go back in there every once in a while now and it's gotten better."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15827320","15829320"," The sights become some it's."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15830320","15833320"," If there was a, like a peak, I fucking hate Wall Street bets."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15834320","15839320"," Seems like that time in Wall Street bets is over. Seems like it's trying to go back."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15840320","15842320"," To what it once was."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15842320","15846320"," Or that it's reverting back slowly. That's attempting to."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15847320","15852320"," I think I think I think it's going back to some semblance of itself."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15856320","15864320"," Oh, yeah, man. Wall Street bets, though. Yeah, I agree. Wall Street bets had some fucking session to be swearing. Wall Street bets had some."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15865320","15866320"," Unreal."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15868320","15870320"," Remember the guy that drank the cup of piss."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15871320","15874320"," In his basement. Do you remember that shit? I remember those."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15875320","15878320"," I think I might still have those pictures somewhere. He deleted them."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15879320","15884320"," There's like all kinds of crazy ass Wall Street bets stories. There's some crazy shit that went on. That's up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15893320","15898320"," I used to post on Wall Street bets like stories about the the Knights of Elon."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15899320","15905320"," We banned the Elon, Elon gang or Tesla gang. It was like you'd like banned Tesla gang than unbanned Tesla gang."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15906320","15911320"," A lot of those guys that have like, you know, a million followers on Twitter, they used to be those guys on Wall Street bets too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15912320","15917320"," I don't know if you guys all know that. A lot of Tesla gang today was on Wall Street bets back then."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15921320","15925320"," Oh, you remember that? I remember that. Dude, I remember that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15926320","15928320"," I remember that on the AMD options."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15934320","15935320"," Do you remember that?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15937320","15948320"," I remember that. Do you remember the guys that would like remember the one guy that was driving his car and he had a he had some kind of long position and lost like $35,000 in like two seconds and he was like live streaming and driving or something when it happened."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15949320","15953320"," There's another fucking guy. Did I get so many stories? Crazy stories."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15956320","15959320"," What's up with spy? Oh, a lot of nothing."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15962320","15963320"," Oh, yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15966320","15968320"," Was that Andrews that was driving, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15970320","15979320"," I'm trying to think of a bunch of shit. Do you guys remember when, uh, so Elon Musk, we all, I believe this day, Elon Musk did come into the subreddit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15980320","15986320"," He come in late, late night on like the slow on the on the like you get like Memorial Day Labor Day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15988320","15997320"," Around those times the subreddit would just get really slow at like three, four in the morning on the Sunday night of like of a Labor Day weekend or some shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","15998320","16005320"," And Elon Musk would come into the sub and start talking to you start slamming people with platinum and gold and all kinds of nonsense."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16010320","16014320"," Oh, yeah. No, I know he was in there. I was there when he was in there. It was fucking awesome. It's fucking awesome."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16018320","16019320"," I didn't know that he ran bots though."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16021320","16024320"," It was fucking epic. It was absolutely fucking crazy."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16026320","16030320"," I used to write these long posts talking about the rise of a Tesla gang."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16031320","16034320"," The Knights of Elon over the dead bodies of fucking old bulls."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16034320","16039320"," Tucking middle of the night like three, four o'clock in the morning. This is crazy. It was absolutely crazy."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16044320","16047320"," Those days were fucking awesome."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16049320","16054320"," You'd like, you'd have like, you'd have like kids college kids would come in and be like, they would tell their whole story."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16055320","16060320"," And they did, and they'd try to kick them out. It was crazy. All right. So it's so cool because back in the day, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16061320","16064320"," You would have like maybe heard a rumor about Wall Street bets."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16064320","16069320"," And so you'd like show up in there and you have zero ever, never in your life traded."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16070320","16074320"," And people would show up and be like, I heard they can make some money here or something."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16075320","16079320"," And we'd kick them out. We'd tell them to go get fucked and ban them."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16080320","16083320"," And then like people would come in and not say a word."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16084320","16087320"," I have zero market knowledge, zero time in market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16088320","16093320"," And they would just be quiet and watch and watch and watch and watch and then like three months later, they'd say something."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16094320","16100320"," And they'd tell you something like, for me to go to college, it's going to cost X amount of dollars."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","16116320","16119320"," They delete your comments sometimes. Your question is stupid. Question is asked."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16119320","16127320"," But then if you stuck around in the subreddit, so if you sat in the subreddit with it open and you were there for like your entire day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16128320","16130320"," Because there'd be like cycles of what you're talking about."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","16186320","16194320"," And so they just fucking, you know, buy a bunch of zero dates by calls and they would lose it all and they'd come back and they'd make a post and say, I didn't listen to you fucking guys."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","16195320","16198320"," I thought I could do it myself and I blew up 35 grand or 50 grand."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","17274960","17277200"," it's it's having a structural breakdown right now"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17279200","17279680"," um"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17282320","17284960"," it's it's it's definitely having a structural breakdown"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17286320","17288320"," so"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17293280","17294880"," in real support is"

"_i07-eFwW4Y","17300560","17304080"," push right here push right here this is where this is where real support is"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17304880","17310400"," 19 dollars 100 percent he's probably right I would say Bob Kendall's probably right"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17310880","17317040"," um and this structural move here this I mean this this move is easy to erase"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17318240","17325440"," there's nothing holding this up there's some in here I guess you could put um"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17332400","17332800"," maybe"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17335920","17337120"," this would be your first uh"

"_i07-eFwW4Y","17340800","17342000"," 2250 or so"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17343360","17347760"," you might start dollar cost averaging into a position I wouldn't be a fucking buyer though until"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17349040","17353920"," until it started to stabilize that's the problem is there's no real point in buying this dip"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17355600","17359280"," you'd want to like let it consolidate and start to get bullish again"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17359280","17363120"," there's nothing to buy here nothing I can say that's or worth buying"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17367840","17369840"," you"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17376720","17377760"," it's not even worth buying it"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17380640","17384640"," now that it's now that it has structural damage what's the point you can just watch it"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17385200","17388960"," fix itself and then consolidate then you can maybe enter a position there"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17389600","17393920"," there's no real point in buying it is there unless you're maybe expecting a"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17394000","17394880"," face for per hire"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17398640","17400640"," if anything that looks very shortable"

"_i07-eFwW4Y","17533920","17538720"," like a like a plunge at like four o'clock in the morning to like 18 dollars and 81 cents"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","17538880","17543120"," that's what i think"

"_i07-eFwW4Y","17582480","17594640"," oh no yes it's less prone to to fluctuation in the in price based uh because it's not based"

"_i07-eFwW4Y","18172800","18178640"," that uh you know port uh so pension funds and 401ks and"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18179600","18185120"," retirement funds and uh portfolio long portfolio managers"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18187040","18190640"," move their money and they try to do it quietly"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18191600","18194560"," and then by the time you found out where they moved it they moved somewhere else"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18196400","18200800"," and so there's this idea that uh i think this was maybe nine or maybe a year ago"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18200800","18203440"," but a year ago maybe a year and a half ago"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18204240","18207200"," January futures satellite two dollars and 78 cents a gallon"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18207760","18213520"," there's like a move into uh REITs and there was this concept that you like you see you hear"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18213520","18217040"," this flooded right we're going into reflect recession and stagflation next year you better"

"_i07-eFwW4Y","18221520","18225920"," you better get in the dow but they were already in the dow so they're getting out of the dow"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18225920","18230880"," hand enough bags and so the question becomes where are they going next where where's all that"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18230880","18235600"," money going everybody wants to know where's that money going so people are like oh it's"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18235600","18240160"," they're going now they're going into TLT let's draw that portfolio manager money's going"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18240160","18244560"," is in TLT and they're probably going to do a sprinkling and uh some risk"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18246080","18249840"," like uh spec growth and tech"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18249840","18255280"," dollars and one cent a barrel uh down two dollars and twenty four cents or three spot zero two percent"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18257520","18260160"," uh so the implication would be that you might see"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18262640","18266000"," what the bears call fake-ass pumps as the market's selling down"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18266800","18271440"," and i'm expecting on the cues January futures to sell at five dollars and 72 cents"

"_i07-eFwW4Y","18984480","18986480"," I am greedy."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","18992480","19002480"," Probably some trap longs in here."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","19052480","19059480"," The buyers will overcome, but I don't think that they do. I think it comes back down here flush out."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19059480","19065480"," Like a nice fat liquidation break and then then you make the move higher."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19065480","19070480"," Squeeze all these longs out."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19070480","19077480"," That's what I want. A liquidation break. Give me liquidation break stuff. Fast one real real fast and hard right down."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","19088480","19094480"," Some people do that would be a three peak design pattern closed right on third three three three nine five."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19094480","19098480"," Waterfall three peaks. Yeah. Yeah, I'd like to see the liquidation break."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19098480","19103480"," I approach futures like a daily job. I'm trying to take a daily salary salary and be done."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19103480","19110480"," Yeah, I most most successful futures traders that I've seen or know treat it like a job."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19110480","19114480"," Come in, make your money, get the fuck out."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19114480","19120480"," If no trades present themselves that are high probability, you don't take a trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19125480","19129480"," Squeely, I'm saying we got a consumer credit level."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19129480","19131480"," Three."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19131480","19141480"," Yeah, you get out, especially if you make the crazy part two is if you make one sometimes I'm here on stream and I'm like, I don't want to fucking take any more trades."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19141480","19145480"," If I've got a hundred percent hater for a day, why am I going to take it?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19145480","19152480"," Take more trades. I sometimes get pissed when I take, I'll make it like 10%, 30%, and I'm like, okay, all right, all right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19153480","19163480"," Then I'll miss the big trade in the day. I'll like stop trading for the day and miss the miss the actual trade I should have taken."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19163480","19168480"," I have like rules for myself. I make like two or three bad trades in a row."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19168480","19172480"," I'm like, like, I'm losing like 10%, 20%, 30%."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19172480","19180480"," Usually I'll cut like, usually I'll cut my losses at about 30%. I'll try to get myself out unless I forget to put a stop in."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19180480","19184480"," But if I start making bad trades, I'm just done for the day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19184480","19189480"," And sometimes there was a great trade in there afterwards and I get pissed myself, but still I'm like, I'm done for the day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19189480","19196480"," I'm not chasing fucking money all day long with the bat with the wrong, with the wrong mentality."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19197480","19207480"," And I've done better on. I've done better on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19207480","19214480"," My, my, my win percentage has."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19214480","19220480"," I used to, I used to make a lot of money and then I would, I would piss away."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19221480","19225480"," Small amounts on overnight holds just for lotto tickets."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19228480","19234480"," And questions that I used to make really good money on lotto tickets when the market was going up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19237480","19249480"," And it worked really well. Like when you're in a supportive market, if you were to like sell down for three or four days, like right into the bell and you were still in positive gamma, you could usually expect a monster rip."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19251480","19260480"," And like long term trending up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19260480","19268480"," You're like, you're like down a negative gamma, but like just down a negative gamma on an overall positive gamma over time."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19268480","19271480"," They were, they were some fucking great trades."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19271480","19278480"," But I found that I do way, way, way, way less overnight holds anymore."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","19631480","19633480"," is we have to find out."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19633480","19635480"," I haven't looked."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","19643480","19646480"," How many put when the when a large batch of puts."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19647480","19652480"," I'm assuming there's a ton of puts in the market that expire on Friday or Monday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19652480","19654480"," I'll look right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19656480","19657480"," Oh, you know what?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19657480","19658480"," I think did the chart guy."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19658480","19660480"," I think I've got a stock charts account."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19660480","19661480"," I don't."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","19665480","19666480"," You want to find out."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19666480","19669480"," Where the highest concentration of puts are that are expiring."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19669480","19670480"," They're either."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19670480","19672480"," They're one of these days this week or Monday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19672480","19673480"," I don't know when they are."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19673480","19675480"," And that should drive."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19676480","19686480"," Yeah, there's like, so there's two things that Chase is making a very good point."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19686480","19688480"," So there's two things to know."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19688480","19689480"," Yesterday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19689480","19693480"," The selling and spy specifically."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19693480","19698480"," Was a real money selling and not options driven."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19698480","19699480"," We talked about that yesterday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19699480","19703480"," Remember when I said to you guys yesterday, I was like, this is not options driven."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19703480","19705480"," And these levels are these."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19705480","19709480"," This selling has nothing to do with like waterfall puts or anything you could tell."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19709480","19712480"," That it was real money selling yesterday and spy."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19712480","19717480"," You could tell it wasn't options driven, but if there are a bunch of put buyers."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19717480","19723480"," That stepped into the market at all yesterday and the let's say they expire like Wednesday or."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19723480","19725480"," Friday or Monday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19725480","19728480"," If they haven't been monetized at this point."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19728480","19730480"," You would expect some kind of a van."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19731480","19735480"," You might not get the charm side of it, but you'll get you'll get the van rally."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19740480","19743480"," We did see some longer dated positions added in the VIX up a bit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19743480","19746480"," And the options flow generally don't speak of major fear protection now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19746480","19748480"," We know that too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19748480","19756480"," You could see that in you could see that in the tech in tech stocks yesterday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19757480","19762480"," There's an argument for us going up to 430 in this too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19762480","19766480"," In other words, we don't see the options market is currently inducing volatility."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19766480","19767480"," I agree with that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19767480","19770480"," We think that if there was an options induced negative feedback."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19770480","19772480"," Was that a loop or a look?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19772480","19776480"," We'd get more bounce or mean reversion after larger drawdowns instead."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19776480","19779480"," Futures just dropping stick is shown above."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19780480","19785480"," Yeah, 40 K and open interest and Monday puts."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19785480","19793480"," Little 3900 put wall support."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19793480","19795480"," We think that volatility changes materially."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19795480","19796480"," Oh, those shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19796480","19797480"," I agree with that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19797480","19801480"," There's a there's a giant chasm down there, Chase."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19801480","19807480"," If we break three 3900 30 3812 or something is coming really fast and hard and strong."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19808480","19810480"," I agree with that statement too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19810480","19812480"," I think that volatility changes material."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19812480","19817480"," This is because below 3900 the positioning is put dominated as shown below in red."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19817480","19818480"," Okay."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19818480","19822480"," Concern here is that the weakness plays in the two factors we outlined two weeks ago."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19822480","19830480"," Large December put positions gain in size and due to FMC, there is a catalyst to break the higher implied volatility."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19830480","19832480"," Yeah, I agree with all that stuff."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19837480","19839480"," No, so."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19839480","19842480"," TLT if TLT goes up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19842480","19846480"," You're going to see this the S&P 500 grade sideways."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19850480","19854480"," Yeah, so there's a it's not just December 30."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19854480","19855480"," There's there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19855480","19856480"," Don't forget."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19856480","19859480"," There's the JPM caller and everybody that follows it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19859480","19864480"," Into I think that's the 17th, isn't it?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19865480","19869480"," Chase, do you remember if it's the 17th?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19869480","19873480"," Can anybody go on Twitter real quick and find out."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19873480","19876480"," If the if the JPM callers, I know they've got three callers."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19876480","19882480"," They got one in J or one in December, one in January, I think in one in February, March."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19882480","19895480"," 10 seconds."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19895480","19900480"," So we're so people are still trapped in calls and they're going to hold them hoping that we go up or not."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19900480","19905480"," So they'll wait until Monday, probably."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19906480","19909480"," Yeah, so chase Troy is saying something that's important too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19909480","19914480"," He's saying eyeballing Friday calls versus puts H strikes either side of the current price calls."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19914480","19916480"," Outway puts 1.5 to 1."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19916480","19919480"," That means we don't go up without a doubt."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19919480","19920480"," They're not going to print those."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19920480","19923480"," Well, we can, but we're unlikely to print them."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19923480","19928480"," It would be more than likely to trade sideways and slightly down into the weekend."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19928480","19934480"," I would think unless some some like material options in the market change."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19935480","19939480"," So the G to the JPM caller is December 30th."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19939480","19942480"," That's interesting to know."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19942480","19948480"," 27, 8 billion 27 spot, 0, 8 billion higher, lower than forecast 28 billion."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19948480","19955480"," Yes."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19955480","19962480"," So there's some there's some argument to say that we could trade sideways and down burn all this shit into Monday, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19963480","19964480"," Yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19964480","19984480"," Well, it's not just that there's there's just no, there's just no, there's no depth of market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","19984480","19989480"," There's no depth of market. There's none. There's some on a longer timeframe."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","20001480","20007480"," There's there's depth of market here going back like I forget how many days, but."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20007480","20011480"," Um, not enough to stop us from hitting 380."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20020480","20023480"," Yeah, that's what I was telling the guys this morning. I was saying."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20023480","20030480"," I was saying this morning that, um, I'm like, man, I'm like, this looks like."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20030480","20039480"," There's like two implications here, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20039480","20042480"," I guess you'd be saying something like, uh, what did I draw?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20042480","20046480"," I thought I drew in a path in here earlier. It's not coming out now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20046480","20053480"," I'm not seeing the path that I drew in."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20053480","20057480"," I don't know. Maybe it's not a different chart. It's not, it's not updating here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20057480","20061480"," I drew a path earlier for the guys. I don't know why it's not here, but."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20061480","20067480"," Um, why it's not showing up, but anyways."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20067480","20074480"," You can see it back here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20074480","20077480"," Let's see where the selling started right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20077480","20081480"," More aggressive selling right here, more aggressive selling right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20081480","20082480"," Right."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20082480","20086480"," And we saw some sellers still strong earlier in the day here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20086480","20089480"," They were hiding too. It was really wild. They just put this up before it even happened."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20089480","20092480"," I was like, Hey, there's some sellers hiding right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20092480","20097480"," And then almost like, yeah, we can, we can trade up here and then they just stepped right in."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20097480","20102480"," Like it was nothing. Um, it's like, I guess the fair would be."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20102480","20109480"," The fair would be that, um, it doesn't matter when."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20109480","20116480"," If we do it now, or if we trade lower and then on Monday, we actually make this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20116480","20119480"," Squeeze higher and then you blast straight down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20119480","20120480"," Yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20121480","20124480"," Yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20124480","20127480"," The fair would be somewhere here and then it'd be somewhere here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20127480","20133480"," Like some kind of a graduated, depending on the day that happens, but then you'd."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20133480","20136480"," You would have to see like a overwhelming push down of three, three,"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20136480","20143480"," 32 into, um, US two to 10 year yield curve inversion reaches 85 basis points."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20143480","20147480"," Somewhere in here. There's a trap to get down to 38."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20147480","20167480"," You have to account for that. So my point, I guess, was if you took this long, long like here, you definitely have to have stops. If you took it long today, up here, definitely have to have stops. And you'd have to know."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20167480","20176480"," You'd have to know before it comes, right? So if we squeeze into the bell here, it would be totally unsafe to hold this into the bell or like you'd have to cut your point."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20176480","20186480"," Take your winnings and leave, because they could do it in the overnight. It doesn't matter where they do it. It could be in the overnight daytime."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20186480","20196480"," In the next four or five days, they're looking to get us down there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20196480","20205480"," There it is right there. Here it is, Chase. I did this earlier this morning."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20205480","20210480"," This is the."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20210480","20213480"," There's that 382 right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20213480","20222480"," See, like at any point, if you come up here, they're going to slam it down. You're going to nail down to this 382 and then you'd get your big ripper for your Christmas rally in the month."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20222480","20227480"," I think this is the plan."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20227480","20239480"," If this isn't the plan, that would meet the JPM car. Unless it was something farther down the line down here for the 31st. Sometimes they do that stupid shit too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20239480","20244480"," You'll see like a."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20244480","20248480"," You'll see the collar hit at the end of the month."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20248480","20271480"," You'll see it at the end of the 31st."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20271480","20275480"," What the heck am I doing here? I'm doing it wrong."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20275480","20301480"," Man, if they hit, if they don't hit that collar here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20301480","20309480"," How do you get up there and then sell that down like that, if I don't sell them, maybe this, maybe the short is here and the next short is right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20309480","20311480"," That would be nasty."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20311480","20317480"," This would, this would fuck some people up right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20317480","20326480"," I think the price target in the colors is a price target. What's the price target in the color? Is it 358."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20326480","20329480"," Or it just starts bloodbath in it down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20329480","20336480"," Man, if they start bloodbath in this down, if they're like, pump, and then bam."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20336480","20344480"," I'm going to have to look at that color tonight."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20344480","20349480"," Definitely going to have to spend some time in that color."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20349480","20356480"," Without a doubt, going to have to spend some time in that color tonight."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20356480","20367480"," I can't remember what the top price target in the color was."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20367480","20373480"," Julie was saying that they thought that they had monetized the call side on the collar the other day."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20387480","20407480"," Yeah, so there are, there's always, so the JPM color is not really a large trade, but it's followed by a lot of other, you know, small trades that make it an impact in the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20407480","20417480"," I see that statement all the time on Twitter and I'm like, nah, it's not about the JPM color. It's about everyone that follows the JPM color."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20417480","20429480"," That's my problem with it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20429480","20440480"," Yeah, so someone said, so someone saying, or no, someone, Julie on Twitter was saying they thought that they might have monetized the call side."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20440480","20452480"," Or bought the calls."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20452480","20459480"," We have to find out what the target is if they didn't on the on the low side."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20459480","20469480"," I can't remember the top of my head. I can't remember if it was 35 as it could have been 3558."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20469480","20471480"," I could be lower. I don't know."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20471480","20477480"," 3558 I think is the number, but I'm wrong. I could be wrong. Don't hold me to that statement."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20482480","20486480"," Just imagine if you bought calls here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20486480","20488480"," Just imagine about those calls."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20488480","20491480"," There's full pain mode right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20491480","20496480"," Get all these buyers up in here, pitch late and right now you got buyers over here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20496480","20499480"," Pitch late and right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20499480","20511480"," Then you got believe Bob's a call mark down here. Can bring your, can bring your use calls down here, please, bring them down to me."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20511480","20516480"," Just buy dividends next week. Don't be in spreads."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20516480","20528480"," Don't be in spreads during dividends."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20528480","20540480"," 10 days still curled over. I'm not bullish right up. I'm not bullish to let 10 day curls back up. I was looking at 10 day yesterday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20540480","20544480"," Off the top of your head. It's 360. Yeah, I think it's 358."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20544480","20555480"," 90 or something. I think this is an exact number. I think it's 358."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20555480","20568480"," You can search on it. You guys say there's like two rules. There's like two rules. Not rules, but."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20568480","20570480"," There's two."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20570480","20580480"," Two things. You always want to be concerned about. Do your spreads overlap dividends and do your spreads close to cash."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20580480","20583480"," You always want to ask that question."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20584480","20595480"," And there's like you just go and you just, if you're, if you're ever like, I want to buy apple calls or apple spreads always do a quick search."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20595480","20600480"," Every company, even if you know that they do or don't just always do it. It's like a rule."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20600480","20610480"," Especially if it's something that you don't normally trade. Always do research on dividends. Always do research on splits. Always do research on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20610480","20619480"," Not spits, not as important, but most most important is does does it does the stock close to cash."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20619480","20631480"," And is it dividends? You can get the execute one side of your trade and you'll get a phone call and they'll tell you will like fucking $300,000 and you're fucked and you'll commit suicide overnight."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20641480","20646480"," You don't hold spreads that long. That's the point you closed before the dividend."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20646480","20651480"," And so there's like rules. We've got over here. So if you buy a spread, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20651480","20655480"," Remember we did the time horizon thing where I said to you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20655480","20659480"," So let's say you spend $100, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20661480","20665480"," If you spend $100 on a spread, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20665480","20670480"," There's different time periods. If you're able to pick direction of the way you want to be going."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20670480","20675480"," The moment that I hit 50% profit, I usually close them. Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20675480","20680480"," I typically don't hold them to 100%. Now, let's say you want to hold 100%."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20680480","20686480"," Because you think you're going to hit it before you ever hit the end of your holding your call or your call or debit spread or put spread or whatever."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20686480","20689480"," You can manage it by cutting legs off."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20689480","20692480"," Because if you come into the money on one side of it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20693480","20696480"," Some people will take the money, the side that they made money on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20696480","20701480"," Like let's say, let's say, especially when you hit 100%, you want to close your spreads."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20701480","20706480"," But people will manage their spreads too. So let's say you're making all your money on one side of that spread, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20706480","20712480"," You take the money and you leave the cheap puts on as a free shot, right? Does it make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20712480","20716480"," It's like a free, free, like Lotto ticket."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20716480","20720480"," The could print or just expire worthless. There's all kinds of different strategies."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20720480","20727480"," Anyways, you can make more money in that timeframe. Anyways, if you buy like a three month spread, does it make sense here?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20727480","20737480"," Along the way, you're monetizing and managing that spread."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20737480","20748480"," No, no, you just need to manage your position. You need to be aware of how what position you took."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20748480","20757480"," How does it close? What does it close to? And you need to know if there's any dividends. You don't want to have open spreads."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20757480","20762480"," Closing in on a dividend."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20762480","20768480"," I've done that too. I've taken the wrong side off before. I've done all kinds of stupid shit. I've made all kinds of mistakes."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20768480","20774480"," I've fat fingered stuff. I've done all kinds of stupid shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20774480","20788480"," I've fat fingered trades, man. Oh, man."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20788480","20797480"," I've been in trades and an internet outages. I've been in trades when the power and the internet go out."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20797480","20805480"," Dude, tasty trade. One of the fucking things I love about one of the reasons I love tasty, like I've had."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20805480","20813480"," Sometimes we'll have like a windstorm, right? Power goes out. Comes back up, backs on them. They're back trading again. Power goes out."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20813480","20819480"," I can call tasty. Get someone on the phone and be like, close this position right now for me. And it's done."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20828480","20834480"," No, no, not here. Hold on a second. I'll look. Give me a second."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20834480","20860480"," Give me one second, okay?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20861480","20875480"," Hold on, Chase."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20875480","20901480"," Just a second here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20901480","20918480"," Oh, my God. I'm looking at some of these guys on fucking YouTube, man. It's like it's like the last."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20918480","20924480"," Like for the last 10 that they pretty much called the market crash 10 times in a row and they finally got a roll over in the market."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20924480","20937480"," And it's like, whoa, so funny. Some of these YouTubers. It's like, it's like, what do you do? Well, you make a video that says the market's going to crash."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20937480","20943480"," And then you make you keep making the guys. It's in the money. Hold on. Sorry. So the guy's name is."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20943480","20951480"," Go to in the money, Adam. Go to his channel."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20951480","20962480"," And where does he talk about this?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20962480","20966480"," Yeah, hidden stuff a light is he got fucked up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20966480","20979480"," This guy is awesome, by the way. A very smart trader."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20980480","20988480"," Okay, so if you look for."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20988480","20994480"," I don't know what video it is he does on this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20994480","20998480"," A couple years ago he made a video."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","20998480","21007480"," I haven't, so I watched this videos a couple years ago and there was like, there was somebody that, well, there's two things that happened."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21007480","21016480"," There were a bunch of people trade and fucking the wheel, I think, if I remember correctly."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21016480","21028480"," Chase, I'll look for it later. He's got a video like two years ago, or a series of videos, three or four of them."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21028480","21034480"," My thought process when trading the wheel strategy, how to trade cash grid puts your wasting your money on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21034480","21038480"," I don't know if that's it though. He's got a video somewhere."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21038480","21042480"," So there is a bunch of people that were."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21042480","21045480"," Trading spreads and we."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21045480","21049480"," So there's like weird, weird shit will happen. So there's a couple of things like there's weird shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21049480","21051480"," So let's say, let's say you're holding like."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21051480","21061480"," This is just an example. Let's say you're holding a spread into the clothes and you don't close your shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21061480","21067480"," If there's huge fluctuation in price after hours, it can still be assigned. That risk can still be assigned to your."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21067480","21070480"," Your options like till six p.m."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21070480","21074480"," So there's like around dividend dates. This will happen."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21074480","21080480"," So they'll execute your shit and like like at six o'clock at night, you'll get a phone call. So some kids, some Robin Hood kid."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21080480","21087480"," A few years ago did this. He woke up in the middle of the night or something in the morning and they said he owed like a half a million dollars or something."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21087480","21090480"," And they're committing suicide."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21090480","21096480"," And then there was like hearings on it, right? But then there's another incident where like a bunch of people were all trading the same shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21096480","21103480"," And he just got that guy Mike in the money or something. He was like teaching people how to trade spreads."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21103480","21108480"," And he forgot to tell them about the risks involved with this one specific."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21108480","21117480"," This one specific strategy and it wound up like blowing up a ton of people's positions."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21118480","21123480"," And people got trapped. I forget the whole story. I don't know this whole story. I'm talking out of."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21123480","21130480"," Man, maybe like 40% is my just recollection recollection and then the other 60% I'm just making it up as I tell you guys the story."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21130480","21135480"," But if you go through that guy's history, he's got a video or two or did have a video about."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21135480","21141480"," Some archaic risks in trading spreads and he goes through it in depth."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21148480","21156480"," Hey, I just talked to my buddy at Goldman Sachs. He made fun of me if they could spike and hold about 400 in the future."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21161480","21165480"," I don't know redacted. I know that guys have been calling for a fucking market crash."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21165480","21168480"," It's like just keep making them until it hits. Then you're like."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21168480","21170480"," Whoa."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21177480","21180480"," Yeah, pen risk is a pen risk is bad too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21186480","21190480"," Yeah, it wasn't. He didn't lose money. Had he just had he called."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21190480","21194480"," I think he couldn't call the time to. I think Robin Hood, you couldn't call them."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21194480","21198480"," But had like had he called a real broker, they would have been like, you've been fine."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21198480","21203480"," They would have been awash by morning. I think he was up actually. I think he was up like 20 or 30 grand when the trade was done."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21203480","21206480"," I don't think he actually lost any money."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21207480","21210480"," I think he made money. I think he made 20 or 30 grand or something."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21213480","21216480"," Yeah, I'm watching right now. I'm down here waiting."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21216480","21221480"," Blue bobs down here waiting down here for you. Come on down. Come on down to blue bobs."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21227480","21232480"," Yeah, and that's so that's the other thing. So actual Dan is talking about this. So if you're in any kind of a spread, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21233480","21240480"," When you start, when you start coming 100% into him, you close them immediately. Immediately you close them."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21244480","21248480"," No, so you can read. So if you read articles and this stuff, it's very dense."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21249480","21252480"," He goes into the exact situations you need to worry about."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21253480","21255480"," Like the need to write that stuff down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21263480","21270480"," Yeah, it was something stupid like that, right? Not a minute email demanding Alex take immediate action."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21271480","21273480"," Any panic, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21275480","21282480"," So yeah, so like there's got so like if you read all the stories on so if you read the technicals on on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21283480","21289480"," Spying or selling spreads, right? There's like a few small things that are very archaic that can happen to you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21290480","21300480"," Very rare rarely happens, but when it happens, people freak out or people can lose a lot of money. And there's like really weird shit that can happen after 4 p.m."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21301480","21306480"," Between 4 and 6 p.m. These these these dealers like these dealers dude in these."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21307480","21310480"," They like there's like a scam that's running this on on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21311480","21317480"," It's not quite a scam. It's like trying to put a price of a stock in the money or out of the money."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21317480","21321480"," So they're not paying out these spreads after the bell. It's really weird shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21333480","21335480"," Oh man, they're trying to buy this shit still."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21337480","21342480"," What's going on with these guys is crazy sauce down here. Like all this nonsense down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21343480","21344480"," Who's buying these fucking dips, man?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21345480","21348480"," I mean, I see who's buying it. I can see it on I can see it on."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21351480","21358480"," On book map this shit's this like mashed potatoes down here. It's like straight mashed potatoes."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21359480","21360480"," Data gang wins today."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21362480","21363480"," I want nothing to do with this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21366480","21368480"," Watch it rip into the bell, but I don't fucking want anything to do with this shit."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21375480","21378480"," We full porting calls before my clothes. If we go lower cap, I would."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21379480","21380480"," I don't think we get it, but."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21385480","21387480"," So I was telling you guys earlier, I'd really like to see."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21389480","21394480"," I really want to really that's a that's a much better that's such a better trade than this bullshit over here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21396480","21400480"," I'd I think personally, I'd rather miss the trade if it went up right where we are."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21401480","21403480"," If we rocket shipped right here, I just missed the trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21406480","21410480"," You got all. Yeah, this is all nonsense in here. This is all nonsense up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21412480","21416480"," You got all these people here just begging and hoping and praying that it goes up."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21418480","21423480"," I just want a nice fat liquidation breakdown here. Wash everybody out and boom."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21427480","21429480"," I don't think I'm going to get it. I'm going to be honest with you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21430480","21442480"," I don't. I can't predict it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21443480","21444480"," Hold on a second."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21451480","21459480"," I can't predict the future, but I can predict what I want to happen so that I feel most comfortable and it's lower."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21460480","21462480"," I want to be honest with you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21472480","21475480"," Rodrigo Kong saying big money scaling out of Apple and Amazon. Yeah, we saw that yesterday too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21477480","21478480"," With Amazon."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21485480","21489480"," Yeah, I don't think they're paying. What do they got there holding 393 P's on the eighth."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21490480","21493480"," You see that 390 P's on the eighth."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21498480","21504480"," So for tomorrow. So tomorrow there's 109,000 puts on 393."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21505480","21509480"," They're already priced in at $1.90. They're going to want those to expire fucking worthless."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21510480","21512480"," So we should get a rip. I just don't know where the rip comes in."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21513480","21517480"," I don't know if the rip is here. I don't know if the rip is tomorrow. I don't know if the rip is in the overnight."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21518480","21524480"," I don't like this. It's not safe. If you're a bull, right? You have to if you're a bull and you're going to buy this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21526480","21528480"," You have to hedge futures without a doubt."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21530480","21531480"," Because they'll knock it down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21534480","21536480"," They knocked it down. Remember last yesterday when I told you guys."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21537480","21541480"," I said we could get the rip overnight and they sell the fucking they sell the cash market in the morning. That's they did, right?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21542480","21551480"," Cashmark came right back in, sold the future of the dealers of buying futures, switched right to cash market, sell cash market, sell the rip."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21552480","21556480"," So we're at risk of that even tomorrow morning. So if you were going to buy."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21557480","21563480"," Try to mentally think about this. If you were going to buy this clothes, you'd prefer to buy it here to give you more more room."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21565480","21570480"," For the sellers to come in and you'd probably capture this into tomorrow. Does that make sense?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21572480","21575480"," So this is the example of a better example."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21577480","21586480"," So if you had bought this yesterday at 42 cents and down here, they were 73 cents off the bell. They printed real fast."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21587480","21593480"," So the futures buying help, but as soon as we came into this morning, they just started fucking selling it down. You see, I sold it down right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21594480","21605480"," And the matter of fact, they didn't write in this area here. They were just yesterday. That's not showing up anymore today, but in here yesterday, right? If you watch this closely in the bell."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21606480","21613480"," They were they were just they were just selling selling selling into this into this rip into the bell and they did it here too."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21616480","21622480"," It's not showing up well in the chart today, but yesterday it showed up really well in the chart. They kind of like erased it from the Internet, but."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21623480","21632480"," So you're seeing them do it selling into strength here, saw it above here. So it's very risky. Like, let's say we started pumping right here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21633480","21643480"," You might get the dealer dealer helping here, but then by tomorrow, if it comes down to here, you're going to be kind of fucked. You kind of want to be safer taken calls near the bell down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21644480","21658480"," With any kind of selling in the morning in the print. And if you're going to take the calls here and let's say we rip into the overnight. If at any point that like four AM, they start selling it, you have to be able to trade low backs to not get burned by open."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21659480","21661480"," So it could be all for not."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21665480","21667480"," You know, we do some kind of nonsense like this tomorrow."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21668480","21671480"," And then they grind out those puts."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21672480","21680480"," Those what those like for three ninety threes or something like that. You still wouldn't capture any of this."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21681480","21686480"," I guess you could capture this over here, but if they ground it all day all day long, it would suck."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21687480","21694480"," So I don't know the answer to you guys can't see half of what I'm doing, but whatever to get my point."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21698480","21703480"," There's going to be an attempt to run this up. I believe there is. I just want. I don't want to buy it there. I want to buy it down here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21704480","21706480"," And if I miss the trade, I miss the trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21707480","21710480"," In balance, currently sitting at three hundred and twenty one million to the sell side."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21711480","21712480"," Yeah, they're going to feed right into this close."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21714480","21717480"," Or I don't know. I'm not interested in unless it comes down."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21720480","21722480"," Let me know what you guys think in the."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21725480","21726480"," We know you guys think."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21727480","21732480"," More mashed potatoes tomorrow."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21739480","21743480"," Gapped down to three eighty eight tomorrow. I don't think you get the gap down tomorrow."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21751480","21753480"," Maybe I'm open to anything."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21758480","21766480"," I could show you meta charts. Are you bullish or bearish on it? I think there's going to be a reprising of meta."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21769480","21773480"," Still, it didn't really participate yesterday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21773480","21776480"," I think it's going to be a lot of fun."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","21818480","21820480"," What looks like an opening on book map, at least."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","21830480","21832480"," Mm."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21861480","21865480"," I think you're just going to crab walk it."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","21890480","21908480"," That's a sneaky peat right there."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","21933480","21935480"," I'll even I'll even put the."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21938480","21943480"," I'll even put the little line there for resting bitchface for it to go up there and sit on for a little while."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21944480","21949480"," It might even be higher like right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21950480","21954480"," Just see if it can get up there and rest on that little ledge."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21960480","21962480"," This will piss winky off."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21973480","21988480"," That's also where this is also where VWAP is too. Right? You guys see that?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","21989480","21990480"," VWAP sitting right there."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22004480","22005480"," Yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22012480","22014480"," Run so far away."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22022480","22024480"," See if they'll crank it up here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22034480","22050480"," You guys watching the order flow down there? It's almost matching up right now. Watch this closely."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22053480","22055480"," Watch the order flow."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22056480","22063480"," So three ninety fours are seven cents. Three ninety threes are thirty one cents right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22066480","22070480"," Ten contracts on three ninety three. Spiring today."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22077480","22082480"," They're fucking doing it again. They're selling into fucking strength. See him doing that?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22083480","22086480"," They're selling into strength right now."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22088480","22091480"," That's real money selling right there. Damn."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22101480","22109480"," I'm trying to think of the like a like a like a term. Like like like it's like it's like drowning a bull and saying you dog based."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","22128480","22135480"," From all that talking yesterday. There's really sore right now too. I was going to I might have to take the day off tomorrow."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22136480","22139480"," I need to take a day of not talking at all. Just note nobody."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22140480","22144480"," I was going to do that today and then I'm sticking around here with you guys."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22147480","22153480"," But I should have I should have I should have I should have just put the stream on this morning not been here with you guys."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22154480","22161480"," I think I'm going to do that tomorrow. Put the stream on just not say anything. Put the stream up and not talk all day tomorrow."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22161480","22169480"," Just get off get off screen some screen time off because my my voice is can feel my vocal cords are."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22172480","22173480"," Are in some pain."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22178480","22180480"," Look at the Costco chart. You have any yard, don't they?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22184480","22186480"," Yeah, I'm going to do the Costco chart for you."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22192480","22193480"," Hold on here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22197480","22201480"," Yeah, it was just yesterday. It was just yesterday."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22207480","22213480"," You know, fucking around the market and all that shit selling in pumps and all that other stuff."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22214480","22222480"," Normally my voice is fine. Yesterday kind of kind of did a number on it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22225480","22230480"," Costco. Let's look at Costco."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22231480","22232480"," Yeah."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22237480","22243480"," Holy shit, those three ninety threes are now forty two cents. They were down to thirty two cents at one point. I didn't buy them."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22248480","22253480"," It's a nice little pump right there. This little move right here was like a was like a twenty five percent change."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22254480","22264480"," Three ninety three three ninety three C's. I was looking at them. I didn't buy them. I'm over here looking at Costco, but from here to here."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22265480","22274480"," They went from a they went down to thirty two cents. They're now fifty cents. This is a hundred percent trade almost right now. It's coming. It's going to be a hundred percent trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22275480","22281480"," If this moves up to view up, you're going to get that hundred percent trade on that."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22285480","22288480"," I'm not in it, but I'm watching it."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22291480","22296480"," Three ninety three C's. They were down to thirty one or thirty two cents."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22297480","22303480"," If we rock it up here, it's going to be like a it could be like a two or three hundred percent trade."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22304480","22309480"," Early market on close imbalance currently sitting at three hundred twenty one million to the sell side."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22310480","22315480"," Don't let them fucking they're trying to they're trying to sell into this right here into this strength."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22317480","22319480"," Fuck."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22322480","22325480"," All right, for market clothes. Let me do this Costco thing."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22327480","22330480"," I wish I'd know I wish I'd known earlier would have done a."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22330480","22335480"," Expected move for you on Costco."

"_i07-eFwW4Y","22349480","22354480"," I got traded up sitting on the lower end."
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22355480","22358480"," They don't have high expectations for Costco. Do they?"
"_i07-eFwW4Y","22361480","22365480"," Well, you know what I'm going to tell you is you're asking about maybe what I think the."
