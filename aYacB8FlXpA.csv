"aYacB8FlXpA","124480","130120"," viewpoints are on the table to whether we're pulling back right now or not and"

"aYacB8FlXpA","221880","226480"," it in August or as late as September but seasonally we're coming into that"
"aYacB8FlXpA","226480","230920"," time and this is was shaping up to be very bearish you know and selling these"
"aYacB8FlXpA","230920","237560"," tops is the right thing to be doing here now there are some market internals"
"aYacB8FlXpA","237560","243200"," that that are complicating this issue right now so in those posts I was talking"
"aYacB8FlXpA","243200","247760"," about how long does it take for us to go sideways before we correct we can go"
"aYacB8FlXpA","247760","254400"," seven to nine days in that process and that would and this would be the start"
"aYacB8FlXpA","254400","260160"," of that process somewhere here you've got one two three four five six seven"
"aYacB8FlXpA","260160","266640"," eight would put us and nine would put us on Friday for unemployment news now"

"aYacB8FlXpA","287720","292080"," as they can they could they could use that right up into wintertime if they"

"aYacB8FlXpA","334960","340320"," tapped again today so that was two taps in the bond market and you know anyone"
"aYacB8FlXpA","340320","344240"," that knows anything about the bond market knows that you know it's looking for"
"aYacB8FlXpA","344240","351280"," that second or third tap can lead to a breakdown of our market our whole"
"aYacB8FlXpA","351280","356040"," entire market you know it's very very dangerous and you know the Fed did"
"aYacB8FlXpA","356040","361400"," something today that is unimpressed not unprecedented but highly unusual it's"
"aYacB8FlXpA","361400","366840"," not like Jerome Powell coming out and holding a speech or something or saying"

"aYacB8FlXpA","404760","410760"," bottom guys know this how critical it was not to break that number today now"
"aYacB8FlXpA","410760","415600"," how it aligned with the 10 year being down as much as it was today was all"
"aYacB8FlXpA","415600","423320"," also had an impact as well as other countries economies failing and currency"
"aYacB8FlXpA","423320","427880"," failures so there are there are some mechanics on a world stage on a macro"
