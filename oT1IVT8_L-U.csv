"3170","4550"," Good morning, traders."
"4890","5870"," Captain Jim James here."
"6430","6930"," Happy Saturday. "
"7830","12170"," I hope all as well this morning that you were all able to go out last night."
"12890","15750"," Have some fun with family or friends or even by yourself."
"17330","22830"," Big shout out to that Quinn invests in the whole Becky quick thing. "
"23150","23910"," That was really rad."
"24730","26570"," Anyways, we're going to take it easy this morning."
"26870","31970"," I want to make this video for you heading into Sunday and Monday. "
"32810","39630"," Now some technical, not technical, but some data points are unknown as of yet."
"42200","47920"," But we're going to talk about where we are in the market so that you have a better understanding of"
"47920","52220"," what to look for as we head into Sunday futures and into Monday."
"52700","58600"," If you're like a pro trader or something, you should probably exit this video because I'm not going"
"58600","65060"," to explain technically why we're here right now. "
"65060","68280"," I'm going to try to give a simple explanation."
"68940","78860"," I always noticed that in books and in posts on Twitter and sometimes in videos, it can be time to"
"78860","86260"," gather complex thoughts into a simple explanation to like, you know, Jill on the street or whatever"
"86260","87820"," or Jim Bob or whatever."
"87820","90560"," It is difficult sometimes to convey. "
"91100","98700"," When I first learned how a trade spreads, I conceptually understood the thought process behind it,"
"98700","103160"," but I couldn't take myself to the next step of executing those trades."
"103780","105780"," I talked to another guy yesterday about that."
"106260","111340"," I needed that next bridge to get to the next part. "
"111520","118220"," So I think that's the focus of this morning's video is just some basic things for people to"
"118220","118580"," understand."
"119100","124100"," What it does is if you start to understand these concepts on their basic level, it gives you a"
"124100","127300"," better feel as to where we are in the market."
"127780","133840"," I get asked that oftentimes and oftentimes I only post very basic information on Twitter. "
"134780","142480"," A lot of my videos are very basic in their information and I sometimes even get shit for it."
"142680","149540"," Like people will say, you know, why are you drawing charts or why are you doing, you know, crayon"
"149540","150480"," gang stuff."
"150880","156380"," And they seem to think that my background is only in, you know, snapping some support and"
"156380","157800"," resistance lines or whatever. "
"158300","160260"," When that's farthest from the truth."
"160940","166940"," But there's not a lot of time to convey information."
"167680","175700"," Sometimes simplifying information is better to get a point across to people than some of the shit"
"175700","176660"," that I watch read. "
"177060","181500"," I mean, some of the shit that I read and watch by the end, I still don't understand what the"
"181500","183960"," thesis is, even though I understand what they're talking about."
"184560","188020"," So I think that's what people are sometimes looking for."
"188100","191920"," When I'm out there and I do my own due diligence, I teach myself. "
"193220","199960"," But I'm all sometimes I'm just looking for some guy out on or some woman out on Twitter to bounce"
"199960","202340"," something off of or to hear their viewpoint."
"202900","207900"," Like if, you know, some guy has been trading for 20 years and he says, we're going up, I like"
"207900","209140"," to hear that sometimes too."
"209600","216080"," You know, it's nice to have someone else, especially in retail, just say it plain and simple. "
"216560","224180"," It doesn't always have to be some kind of fucking, I don't know, like, you're like archaic thing"
"224180","228540"," that I have to go back and decipher even if I understand what he's talking about."
"228720","230420"," So I don't know if you get my point or not."
"231000","234720"," So anyways, and then I want to talk about one other thing, and this is the bull bear case and"
"234720","235320"," stuff like that. "
"235800","236980"," You know, we are going down."
"237560","241680"," But even though we're going down, you have to understand like the runs that the bulls are going on"
"241680","243380"," are just as insane."
"244040","247320"," Like you're talking 100, 110, 150 point runs. "
"247880","250500"," Some weeks, we don't even move that many points."
"251140","252500"," This is in days."
"252960","255700"," It's insane the moves that are being made right now. "
"256399","261600"," So I don't think it matters which side, especially in this downturn, I don't think it matters which"
"261600","263640"," side you're trading right now."
"263700","266340"," I know that you're making way more money on the short side."
"266600","272080"," But dude, there's so much money in the market coming out of the market right now. "
"272840","273760"," It's wild."
"274300","275620"," It is absolutely wild."
"276180","277580"," So we're going to talk about a few things. "
"278000","284340"," So we're going to go into, I'm going to take you back here on this larger picture later."
"284840","288200"," But I want to take you quickly to the close yesterday."
"289320","291280"," And I got spooked yesterday. "
"291960","294940"," I bought this second bounce yesterday."
"296640","298540"," And I didn't buy the first one."
"298860","307720"," And the reason I didn't buy the first one was because there are websites you can go to that shows"
"307720","309020"," you where the buyers are. "
"310000","315440"," So you'll see where heavy concentration of big money is, where they want to buy into the market."
"315900","321320"," And one of those websites yesterday showed that there were buyers down at 4470."
"322600","324800"," That's possible they could have came up to 4480. "
"326080","330040"," And the first buy was at 4489, I believe."
"331060","336180"," But that buy yesterday was not that money that was sitting lower."
"336620","339620"," And I posted on Twitter, that's a fake rip. "
"340120","343900"," And the reason that I posted that was because that wasn't that money from down below."
"344460","349020"," That was shorts covering end of day."
"349260","350980"," And I want to get a little bit closer and explain. "
"351240","353080"," And people asked me about that yesterday too."
"353600","356060"," I explained it better to you exactly what took place."
"356800","360600"," So you had shorts come into the market down here, okay, towards them. "
"360660","361780"," They were like right in this area."
"362120","367120"," And we sat here from 130 until three o'clock, I think, right?"
"368240","376840"," And so when we were down here, these shorts were expecting for a much bigger dip, no less than 4470"
"376840","377680"," probably."
"379040","383960"," When that didn't happen, they had to cover their shorts into the clothes, okay?"
"384640","385780"," And so they became buyers. "
"386600","389220"," So they covered their shorts, we rode up into the clothes."
"389880","395060"," Now, while this was happening yesterday, those buyers from down below, that's smart money from down"
"395060","400420"," below, did not swoop up like a shark or a whale and start buying."
"402140","403780"," That was the first clue yesterday. "
"405100","411880"," The second thing that happened is when we came down to this 4500, this is hard support by the way."
"412800","417020"," This is whether you know it or not hard support as of right now."
"417900","421420"," But when we came down here yesterday, a couple things were happening in the background. "
"422100","428260"," There are hedge funds out there that are long, a bunch of speculative shit."
"428800","430160"," That's all they're long on."
"430780","433540"," And they've started to get margin called yesterday. "
"434300","435100"," That's what happened."
"435500","441320"," And while they were getting margin called yesterday, these shorts here or pre knew this was going"
"441320","442160"," to happen, okay?"
"443340","453040"," And so these hedge funds started to buy protection at the lowest point, the worst lowest point in"
"453040","453800"," the market yesterday."
"454420","460840"," They wound up buying put protection farther out and deeper than where we are right now. "
"461840","465560"," And that does a few things to the market, okay?"
"466220","473900"," It allows us to go deeper than 4500 if or 4500, yeah, 4500 if supply runs out, right?"
"474740","479300"," And it drops our negative to positive volatility gamma."
"480140","487280"," What that basic term just means is that whenever we come up to a certain level here, there will be"
"487280","487660"," volatility."
"488100","489200"," There will be sellers, right?"
"490040","493540"," In that level is coming down farther and farther over time. "
"494100","499420"," Well, it went yesterday down to 457 from 460."
"500680","509900"," So we dropped from 457 or excuse me, 460 to 457 into close yesterday, okay?"
"510820","513039"," You've got margin calls under hedge funds."
"514140","519640"," And then you have put protection being taken out at a horrible time. "
"519640","528800"," And then to cover those margin calls, you saw after the close crypto dump and"
"528800","531260"," you saw Vix over 30."
"531700","536860"," When the Vix gets over 30, I set my post about this part two on Thursday and you start to"
"536860","543900"," see certain mechanics or when you start to see certain things or certain metrics be made, it kicks"
"543900","551520"," in moves by institutions that they have to follow, protocols, right?"
"551700","552500"," That they have to follow."
"552960","560860"," And so you saw this de-risking yesterday or last overnight in the crypto market. "
"561440","563120"," So what does all this mean, right?"
"564100","567460"," Well, it's a scary situation, believe it or not."
"567700","570440"," So what you're having now is this."
"570720","576280"," Let's say you had 4500, there's the bottom down here, right?"
"576420","577120"," The absolute bottom. "
"578080","582880"," And then up here, you had some volatility triggers below too, right?"
"583660","584840"," But it end above."
"585200","592860"," But the problem is that we are compressing to a resolution at this point."
"593660","598520"," The top is getting lower and lower and the bottom is not moving. "
"599860","605500"," And so when that top keeps getting lower and lower and lower, and the bottom hasn't moved, right?"
"606180","611400"," It starts to create a bottleneck while we have a very high Vix number."
"612260","613840"," And so what does that mean?"
"614120","617940"," Well, it means, it means some sort of squeeze."
"618860","628260"," And it could end very ugly or it could end to all-time highs, like ridiculous all-time highs. "
"628800","635000"," It's not going from 4500 to 478 matter of days."
"635460","636980"," That's how crazy it is."
"637800","638360"," Okay?"
"638700","640880"," That's how crazy the moment we're in right now is. "
"641380","642120"," So it is."
"642380","648400"," That's why I didn't take a long into this close on Friday was because of the mechanics that are"
"648400","653620"," moving right now in the market are literally, you're looking for certain things to happen."
"653980","656900"," Now, we talk about, if you take along, right?"
"657740","661860"," That you're going to let, I want some of you to really hear this because I don't think you're all"
"661860","662720"," listening to my videos. "
"663320","666420"," When you're coming up to one of these resistance points up here, right?"
"667160","670400"," You want a bank to take it over for you to then get long."
"670860","674340"," The same holds true for our support levels."
"675140","682700"," So let's say you're taking this short, you're not going to hold puts or shorts into past this"
"682700","683820"," point, okay?"
"683980","685100"," Unless someone takes you there. "
"686120","691780"," So you have to remove them or wait until we jump below and then pick them up back up again."
"692320","696380"," That same thing works for the tops and the bottoms when we're in this situation."
"697680","702280"," Now, so if you're a bear on Friday, my recommendation would have been you wait. "
"702980","705420"," You take your puts off, you take your shorts off."
"706480","712140"," The mechanics of what took place here is high risk for a bull and I want to explain next why"
"712140","716900"," because we still are not at at 4600."
"717500","725980"," Our trigger was lowered yesterday and with the weekend being a low liquidity environment that"
"725980","728720"," ceiling has come down to 45 seven. "
"729460","735780"," So if we rip into clothes and then let's say Sunday futures, we rip and we tag for four five"
"735780","741720"," seven in Sunday futures, it could trigger one of those selloffs like we had in the past in this"
"741720","750460"," environment because it's not let's say we're at four five six in the overnight and you're thinking"
"750460","754180"," to your in Sunday futures and you're thinking to yourself everything is fine."
"755520","761920"," Well, because we have till four six zero, right, you actually don't you only have until four five"
"761920","764600"," seven before that volatility kicks in."
"765120","769980"," And so the question then becomes how many sellers are up there versus how many buyers did the"
"769980","776060"," buyers step up in the Sunday overnight to fill or to consume those sellers. "
"776420","784860"," So the the neckline here or the neck is being choked as volatility increases and as we get closer"
"784860","787040"," to the buy side."
"787700","790180"," Now, this is what I think is going to happen."
"790920","796320"," I think the best chance of what's happening of what's going to happen is you're going to see"
"796320","798900"," volatility still in the coming days. "
"798940","801920"," You're going to see really fast movements up and down."
"802400","809280"," I think the range of those movements are going to be very small and the resolution will either be"
"810000","811760"," crazy high or crazy low."
"812240","818240"," Okay, I think more on the upside, but there is a lot of stuff right now saying that it is"
"818240","818940"," to the downside. "
"819280","824060"," If those buyers are worn out, it will trigger a move lower."
"824520","831020"," Now, how does this all what's another way that this gets resolved is that those buyers from 4500"
"831020","840560"," step up and you start to see market participants betting longer than just one day on calls or puts."
"840820","848720"," If you start to see calls being bought that are dated for late December, early January, March, you"
"848720","850560"," will start to see the market increase. "
"850920","854980"," You also want to see puts being not being bought at the levels that we're at."
"855340","857100"," Okay, they're not for one day."
"857300","861800"," We had we had again on Friday, yeah, that same situation took place last Wednesday. "
"862520","865900"," So I'm scared heading into Monday, I'll be honest with you."
"866680","868900"," I'm not normally scared of where we're going."
"869040","875040"," I'm not scared, but I'm not normally concerned about where we are in the markets and there is high"
"875040","876280"," risk heading into Monday. "
"876720","879920"," And to prove that point was what happened with crypto last night."
"880240","883280"," So you can't say that it's not there into this weekend."
"883900","892380"," All I hear is parrots out there saying that the S&P 500 is now mimicking Bitcoin and it has"
"892380","898520"," somewhat started to started to trade along with the S&P 500, not completely. "
"899260","901580"," And it's not it's not exact anymore yet."
"901840","906460"," It's closer than it was a year ago, which is insane that it only took a year for it to"
"906460","908100"," trade closer to the S&P 500."
"908640","910280"," But that was not a good look. "
"910540","914080"," No matter how you look at it, that was not a good look heading into Monday morning."
"914080","919840"," You can you can say you can rationalize wherever the fuck you want in your head, but it's not a"
"919840","920200"," good look."
"920700","923980"," Now, we have some other things we have to talk about here. "
"924140","929600"," Okay, I really want to talk to the people that are wondering about when they can reinvest in the"
"929600","934420"," market and when they can take along and not worry about it, having to watch the market constantly."
"935080","939160"," You are looking for we're in a negative gamut environment right now."
"939160","940180"," So we have high volatility. "
"940840","942240"," That's what is to be expected."
"943620","948840"," We're high range movements, even though we're in this bottleneck, you're then going to see this"
"948840","950140"," really jagged movement."
"950960","953560"," You really want to see us flip to a positive gamma. "
"954480","961100"," And when we flip to that positive gamma, what happens is the moves become smaller and you'd be"
"961100","961460"," surprised."
"962220","969920"," When we're in that positive gamma, you will tend to see an upward movement to the stock market and"
"969920","977080"," less damage done to the calls that you're owning and the stock underlying or shares that you own in"
"977080","977480"," the underlying."
"978260","982260"," And so if you wanted to take along, so I'm going to do this quick line. "
"982280","989340"," This is going to this isn't even exact, but what you need to know between now and here I'll do"
"989340","989960"," this one here."
"990280","999950"," Do this what you really need to know right now is that we not not only do we need to"
"999950","1007770"," be above 4570, but we now need to break above 4600 like this zone right here."
"1008130","1011930"," We need to break above it and rest on it and start moving. "
"1012590","1017990"," This moment up here is when you can actually take along and not worry about it any longer."
"1018350","1023210"," And these lines are going to move every day as we move down or as we move down, because once"
"1023210","1025410"," these buyers step in, we're going to break above this and push."
"1025770","1030510"," Now, when you break above this area here, you throw the boat at it. "
"1030869","1032190"," You just go to the kitchen sink."
"1032890","1038450"," And once you get started getting some confirmation, they're making higher highs, higher lows, all"
"1038450","1041530"," those long time things that people that traders tell you that are rules."
"1042150","1047630"," Now, so that's for you as the long term investor or long term bull. "
"1048170","1057910"," You can't take right now because people are getting"
"1057910","1059450"," filthy rich right now."
"1060130","1066810"," There is stupid money being made on both the long and short sides right now, like stupid,"
"1067350","1069950"," ridiculous money being made."
"1070810","1076830"," And I've showed you in previous charts where the where the support are where these zones are above"
"1076830","1077270"," and below. "
"1077710","1079790"," You just take the middle of it."
"1080030","1083930"," If you just take the middle of this stuff on long and short, you're going to be fine."
"1085830","1089090"," And this stuff has been pretty predictable. "
"1089650","1095290"," If you can't trade this environment right now on a daily basis, I don't know how to say to you."
"1096010","1100250"," This is the easiest trading environment that I've seen in a long time."
"1100470","1104330"," Now, let's go on a farther up basis over here. "
"1104490","1108390"," I want to take you back to the thought process here."
"1109650","1111170"," I want you guys to go out there."
"1111370","1115870"," I know everybody's saying we're having a wake off event or wake off or a jack off event right now. "
"1116890","1120350"," If that's the case, we're heading down here."
"1120730","1122650"," We're heading down to this 4,200 level."
"1122890","1125210"," That's that is where we're heading, whether you know it or not. "
"1125490","1129910"," If it if it meets the standards of of a wake off event."
"1130490","1133850"," So I don't know what to say to you on that."
"1134230","1137050"," The concern here is that we break this 4,500. "
"1137350","1142850"," If we do, this was defended on Friday and it was defended here on the first as well."
"1143090","1145350"," It's been defended now two or three times, I think."
"1145970","1147270"," I want to look at it now. "
"1147430","1150010"," It's been defended three times."
"1150930","1151850"," And this is the key."
"1152090","1157330"," What I posted on Friday was a stick save for the bulls was that we defended. "
"1157890","1159090"," We defended again."
"1159670","1163070"," And not only do we defend on Friday, but we rose much higher."
"1163070","1164490"," Okay, we have a nice high close. "
"1164970","1172790"," And this is a positive for the bulls, but that would happen with this crypto on Saturday is not"
"1172790","1173110"," good."
"1173430","1180370"," There are underlying mechanics that are still saying that we're still in a risk off situation."
"1181210","1182610"," That's all I've got for you this morning. "
"1183070","1185090"," So that's what you have to take from this."
"1185310","1190730"," You have to sort of what it means is this is that you know where our bottom is right now."
"1190770","1192510"," It's 4,500, right?"
"1193230","1198890"," You know right now that 4,570 is now where we encounter volatility. "
"1199970","1203650"," You know, you can take longs down below here."
"1204370","1208810"," As long as there was as long as it starts to turn back up, right?"
"1208910","1209750"," You're waiting for that signal."
"1210170","1211390"," And the same goes for the top. "
"1211390","1213310"," You're going to see a bounce and then come back down."
"1213310","1222190"," You know that we're going to resolve this situation heading into I would say December 17th would be"
"1222190","1222530"," the day."
"1222910","1224750"," I know you guys are all wanting the holiday rally. "
"1224930","1226170"," You might get it in this resolution."
"1227010","1233450"," But I'll tell you what, if we keep bouncing down on this 4,500 and grinding down here and we're"
"1233450","1242770"," in the market is absorbing these buyers or if these buyers disappear because they know that hedge"
"1242770","1249830"," funds are de-risking their portfolios right now, it is certainly easy to see a rug pull down here"
"1249830","1251690"," and we start heading much lower."
"1252330","1257430"," So the market is becoming riskier and riskier and riskier. "
"1258170","1264350"," It's still somewhat applies to the to the bears as well that they could get trapped themselves."
"1265010","1270190"," If those buyers step up here, if there's a meeting right now going out the Fed that we don't know"
"1270190","1272430"," about, we're going to do a relief above."
"1273510","1278150"," But these moves here are starting to concern me. "
"1279110","1282430"," And the action in here is most concerning."
"1282810","1285110"," This action here is not normal."
"1288470","1291390"," Okay, so I had to cut off there for just a minute. "
"1291870","1293310"," I don't know exactly where I let out."
"1293510","1296490"," But the point is this, you're going to find resolution in here."
"1297170","1299710"," This is a big wall right here. "
"1300450","1307090"," This is a lot of support when you if we grind through this wall, the look up below is massive"
"1307090","1310110"," and that is where the protection is coming on."
"1310250","1316650"," That's where it was coming on to close on Friday was that the risk profile of us going down has"
"1316650","1317590"," increased dramatically."
"1318070","1321230"," Now, people were talking about puts dying on Friday. "
"1321590","1322990"," There's some puts dying on Monday."
"1323310","1330490"," I watched puts come in on Friday to cover Monday and to cover the rest of early next week."
"1331070","1335190"," That puts me on edge puts me on edge for sideways movements. "
"1335730","1342950"," If we even if we go up to still bounce here and to maybe churn here for the rest of"
"1342950","1345270"," next week, unless more bears step in."
"1345910","1355890"," Okay, I don't think that the that the sell off in crypto yesterday was a good look for"
"1355890","1359190"," this resolution coming into next Monday."
"1360490","1361510"," Okay, and I'm a bull. "
"1361890","1363370"," Like I do I am straight bull."
"1363730","1365310"," So I don't know what to say to you at this point."
"1366670","1371430"," I play what comes in front of me and I'll take this ride straight up. "
"1371450","1380910"," I won't get as long as I'm not in in the"
"1380910","1382650"," in the after hours environment."
"1383010","1388910"," If we're way up here like being way up here into after hours was a no go for me too"
"1388910","1389730"," close to the sun."
"1390390","1394850"," So if we come up here and we break above at the opening bell on Monday, sure I'll take that"
"1394850","1396130"," long right here, right?"
"1396870","1401790"," But if we come up here and bounce off and start selling down into the open tomorrow, I'm not going"
"1401790","1403870"," to take another long until we get down below over here. "
"1404090","1406850"," Okay, so Sunday futures is going to be very important."
"1407930","1412610"," For where we are on Monday, you're going to start playing this zone in here come up come Monday,"
"1412610","1412890"," right?"
"1413310","1417950"," And no matter what futures tells you coming into Monday morning, you're looking for these two areas"
"1417950","1421390"," down here, you're looking for 4500, you're looking for 4570."
"1421710","1427250"," And you bulls, as of Monday, you're looking to take go long. "
"1427270","1433930"," If you're an investor type bull, you want to see us come above 4570 and hold it and stop looking"
"1433930","1437530"," at these these peaks up here, these peaks mean nothing right now."
"1438370","1445110"," Okay, you're looking for 4570, trust me, you need to break above 4570 and then you need to rest"
"1445110","1446350"," above 4600."
"1446670","1451550"," Okay, I will see you all on Saturday, Sunday or Monday, I've got a bunch of stuff I got to"
"1451550","1451930"," do this weekend. "
"1452390","1458970"," Do me a favor too, I know that you guys hate liking and subscribing to people, but I don't know,"
"1459070","1466590"," I don't charge hard, right?"
"1467170","1470270"," It helps me to keep making videos."
"1471290","1476330"," So when I see that stuff, I see people say, hey, thanks for taking time to make a video, makes"
"1476330","1477330"," you want to make more videos."
"1478230","1481830"," When I see people liking these videos and makes you want to make more videos, I don't understand"
"1481830","1483670"," that. "
"1483950","1488410"," And I'm working on getting you guys all plugged into to the private handle."
"1488790","1492550"," If anyone wants to know, I don't charge for that, that's free."
"1492790","1493470"," I don't charge for anything. "
"1493990","1495630"," You need to remember out there."
"1495790","1502210"," If you're listening to this video still, you need to remember out there that I might not like you,"
"1502210","1504990"," you might not like me, we are retail."
"1506270","1510790"," And you know, we're not the biggest part of the market yet, but someday we will be the biggest part"
"1510790","1511250"," of the market. "
"1511790","1516310"," And we need to at some point be a force in the market."
"1516670","1524190"," And until bulls bears, data gang all work together to try to try to discuss and rationalize"
"1524190","1528970"," information as to where the market is actually going at certain key points, then Wall Street"
"1528970","1530430"," doesn't give a fine fuck about us."
"1531450","1538250"," The moment that there's some form of resolve to how we trade as a group, whether it's we're trading"
"1538250","1543350"," the market down or we're trading the market up, then we don't have a same way the market moves. "
"1543910","1551310"," If we're ever able to do that though, and as more more more Joe Bob's from from Milwaukee come into"
"1551310","1557090"," the market to make their retirements, when if that was ever able to happen, we would be a force to"
"1557090","1563910"," reckon with literally we could be as strong or as powerful as an S believe it or not or a"
"1563910","1564290"," JPM."
"1564710","1569470"," I don't know if you guys all understand that, but I'm sure that there are companies or people"
"1569470","1576150"," working towards making that information key or available at some point."
"1576330","1581930"," I mean, shit's going to get wild over time, but my point behind that is, rather than rather than"
"1581930","1587710"," just being a total fucking troll, try to talk to your fellow man out there, like we're all trying"
"1587710","1588670"," to make money out there. "
"1589070","1595670"," Okay, and you're not actually taking money yet from your fellow or your opponents bull or bear."
"1596430","1599890"," You're taking money from the banks, from Wall Street."
"1600330","1601630"," Think of it from that perspective. "
"1603330","1607170"," And no, you are not and I am not moving markets."
"1607510","1609570"," I'm not moving this market by talking about spy."
"1610610","1617190"," You're not moving the market by fucking pumping Bitcoin or dodgecoin or doge. "
"1617730","1618630"," You're just not."
"1618790","1620770"," You think you are, but you're not, okay?"
"1621610","1621850"," Sorry."
"1623630","1625550"," Anyways, have a great weekend. "
"1625930","1626730"," I'll catch you on Sunday. "
