"90120","91240"," I'm going to get right to it."
"91880","92920"," I'm going to have a lot of time here."
"92940","94540"," I'm trying to do some work here. "
"96560","97340"," Good morning, everybody."
"97520","98280"," How y'all doing?"
"103440","104360"," Oh, come on now."
"112060","117200"," Sometimes YouTube, the back end, is very wonky. "
"165840","167080"," All right, good morning, everybody."
"167700","170040"," Bull's waking up all right this morning, kind of."
"170560","171300"," Let's see here. "
"171840","172260"," We're going to mute."
"178050","179710"," We'll mute the book map at the moment."
"185880","187120"," And let me see. "
"190240","192700"," 5.4, 394, 17."
"197070","198370"," Right there."
"209440","212680"," R1, 396, 95, if you're following at home. "
"220140","220600"," What about there?"
"222100","232280"," 2, 98,"
"233060","233060"," 39."
"235220","249350"," 4, 117."
"253650","254370"," Close enough. "
"255290","256730"," R1, R2, R3."
"258329","259990"," So it's really tight up in here, right?"
"260089","263050"," You can see this morning that it's pretty tight up here."
"277680","279820"," And then down below is where it actually gets really. "
"283900","284740"," Blow our pivot."
"285120","290960"," So we've got a pivot above here, and then we've got support S1 is going to be 392, 73."
"297950","299730"," S2, 3, D9, 95. "
"303550","317340"," We've got"
"317340","319360"," 38, 51."
"324560","325960"," For S3, right?"
"326300","327120"," Tight range here."
"327760","332520"," We do have some, we have an implied move this morning, though, that is quite larger. "
"333660","338580"," So we're going to come right back down where we started down here."
"347590","350350"," And we're also going to snap a line above."
"360360","364880"," Somewhere, I think there's $2 and it could be like 403 and some change. "
"365320","366420"," Southern 403 and some change."
"366560","369060"," I'll look at the S this morning, see what the difference is."
"369180","370020"," Probably 403, 60. "
"370260","372060"," I'll make sure I can, I'll firm that up for you."
"372180","374480"," But I think this is where the JPM collar is."
"374680","376540"," 4, 0, 4, 0, 6, 5."
"376940","381940"," So it's 4, 0, probably 404, 5, somewhere in there. "
"383380","385240"," I'll try to get a better number for that for later."
"385240","389680"," This is, I think this is where the JPM collar is with the price difference."
"393700","397440"," And you guys have seen, you guys have seen me on video for a week or two. "
"397700","399000"," We'll go through a bunch of stuff this morning."
"399980","401120"," You guys have seen me."
"402200","404220"," There are previous low is down below here. "
"406460","416380"," And we'll check this on"
"416380","417140"," an hourly too."
"419180","421160"," And what you're looking for this morning."
"432050","437510"," Yeah, this is where the white line wasn't showing up for you guys. "
"437570","438490"," Remember this white line?"
"438510","440430"," You guys remember this from, I did do a video."
"440550","441910"," The other day, I don't know what happened that morning."
"442430","445510"," I think I, my, my router resets itself every morning. "
"446310","452130"," And I think that, um, I think that, I think that stops the stream."
"453070","455250"," Now what you, what you need to know this morning is."
"458050","459410"," We need to know this morning. "
"459730","460670"," It was two fold."
"461510","465630"," A big part of this morning is, uh, so we're in the five minute right now."
"465690","466610"," We're going to get the 15 minute. "
"468090","471850"," And it's important for you to see this blue line in this green line down here."
"472310","474170"," And then the one hour specifically."
"475410","478070"," You can see where we can fall down here. "
"478590","488570"," Now some people are going to tell you today that, uh, let's say we, we get a"
"488570","489470"," bad CPR report."
"490870","492210"," There's a couple of things that could happen."
"492210","493410"," We could, we could trade higher. "
"493650","495410"," The initial reaction would be a sell off anyways."
"496470","500150"," And I want you to realize that right off the TPI return back to mean."
"501190","506830"," Another thing would be to be watching this blue line on the hourly for trend to continue. "
"507770","511710"," Uh, but to be honest, it would be, it would be the most bullish."
"512789","517530"," For us to go higher, break through and continue on."
"518090","521429"," Uh, and strength on into a monthly move here. "
"522830","526590"," Uh, so I don't even know if we get a bad CPR report."
"528170","530710"," Or let's see a neutral CPR report."
"530830","531830"," I want to be aware. "
"532230","533010"," This is some other problems."
"533870","538110"," I'll show you the market breath indicator because we're kind of top of the top of the breath as"
"538110","538370"," well."
"538950","540710"," So we could have a pullback here. "
"540710","545370"," Uh, you know, uh, slap, you know, you slap a high and then you have a pullback."
"545570","551010"," But on an hourly and then a daily chart, there's a couple of places to be looking, uh, looking at."
"551090","551290"," Okay. "
"551590","553470"," I'm going to change this previous side of right here."
"554190","556410"," And I'm just going to, I'm just going to keep that right there for there."
"556510","557890"," I'm going to look back on the daily as well. "
"559770","562250"," And this is really the big one right here."
"562670","568010"," So you can see this daily, if this daily comes up in here, you see this, if we catch this,"
"568310","571090"," right, I want to this confluence of S3 in here."
"572190","577210"," If we are able to catch this confluence on a daily chart, it's not going to matter. "
"577350","582390"," You know, that sounds crazy, but, uh, the confluence of this daily chart of this green and blue"
"582390","582930"," line right here."
"582970","587470"," If we catch that at any point this morning or later this afternoon, we don't break."
"587890","589690"," We don't break this previous low. "
"590110","591490"," Uh, and we hold this."
"593150","595090"," It's possible we could continue higher."
"595090","603570"," Uh, and this would be the catalyst for the market moving higher outside, break free of the downward"
"603570","604870"," channel you've been in all year long. "
"605790","607650"," So I'm interested to see that today."
"607950","610250"," What happens on the daily and the hourly."
"610750","611270"," Truly. "
"612610","614950"," If you are a, if you're a bull."
"616730","618470"," You want to see this hold right here."
"619110","620290"," That's really all you need to know. "
"621090","622210"," That's truly it."
"622490","623910"," You just need to hold this down here."
"624950","625730"," You could care. "
"625990","628730"," You give rats ass about where we go in the next 15 minutes."
"629270","631390"," What you need to be caring about is this right here."
"631870","632470"," Just continuation. "
"633590","634570"," If you're a bear."
"635390","637430"," Now there is that trade lower for you."
"638150","639070"," But the juice. "
"640170","641750"," Is below this down here."
"642210","643650"," That's where you get real bearish."
"644610","647490"," Uh, and this break of the blue line right here is 39416. "
"648250","649150"," This is a nice trade."
"649410","651670"," You got a couple of good trades in here as a bull as a bear."
"651670","653750"," You got, you know, the trade down here. "
"655050","656810"," You have this trade down here."
"657570","659470"," Uh, but the juicy part of this trade."
"660530","661770"," This is like the blood. "
"661950","663370"," This is JPM telling you."
"663830","664890"," I'll tell you about JPM."
"665230","666330"," They, they released. "
"666790","668150"," They did a couple of things this week."
"668810","671810"," They're open to us going higher and they, they can be now."
"672170","674210"," They're saying no though in the back end right there. "
"674270","676370"," Their, their, their hedging says that."
"677590","679530"," We're going to peak out at four, six, five."
"679530","682530"," We're going to roll this thing down and blood bath down to. "
"683190","683930"," I don't know."
"684450","684850"," 3200."
"685290","686210"," That's like 800 points. "
"687190","687970"," Uh, it's from mid March."
"688910","690190"," Does that happen or not?"
"690330","690710"," I don't know."
"690970","691710"," But I'll tell you that. "
"691790","692170"," I'll tell you what."
"693490","697610"," Uh, if we get underneath, if we get underneath these moving averages here, right?"
"699130","700390"," Doom and gloom down there."
"701190","703310"," You know, so, so this move here is not. "
"703610","705250"," Think about this in relative terms, right?"
"705830","708430"," You've got three 3800 3050."
"708430","709370"," It means nothing."
"710690","713750"," 32, 3200 is a huge move down. "
"713970","716570"," So bears need to be productive over here."
"717050","718730"," This is where a bear gets very productive."
"719690","725150"," Now if we go up and slap up higher and we start trading back down here, all the bull wants"
"725150","729890"," is for this to hold in the future, whether it's a week from now or two weeks from now, we"
"729890","733410"," trade sideways for earning season down here. "
"734730","735910"," And then a resumption higher."
"735910","740690"," And we'll talk about that later this afternoon or this morning about that resumption higher because"
"740690","742770"," that's what happened back here."
"744190","745350"," All this back here. "
"746090","751170"," Uh, we'll go back to the beginning on the first of the year and explain how risky we were down"
"751170","756390"," here to having a market crash instead retail with selling in banks or buying."
"756630","762010"," You can see it happening and I'll show you how you could have seen it happening back here and known"
"762010","763570"," that we weren't going to bloodbath."
"763570","769010"," They were actually going up because the videos that we've made actually actually talk about what"
"769010","774150"," was showing differently than this bearish formation over here. "
"774310","774370"," Right?"
"775930","779430"," So we'll talk about all the things that led up to this moment that we're going higher."
"779890","785090"," We're going to talk about when we should expect a real true market crash at some point this year."
"785890","787730"," We'll talk about the yielding version. "
"788030","788810"," A bunch of other crap."
"790270","791010"," We got what."
"793430","795550"," 13 minutes until the until the open right here. "
"796250","799910"," If you want my take and what I think is going to happen this morning personally make sure I got"
"799910","800070"," the."
"800790","806390"," Let me get the guy speaking here in the background so you can get the news from him directly."
"807790","809910"," I'll be quiet when he starts talking this morning. "
"811630","813150"," Do you want my take on this?"
"813470","814430"," I don't think it matters."
"815290","817130"," I don't think CPI matters."
"817130","821910"," I think what mattered was that we had the accumulation down below my banks. "
"822650","823510"," They wrote it up."
"824590","829530"," And they're and they're more than likely not positively show that we get up this high up here."
"830090","831830"," But their job is done at this point. "
"832570","838470"," The CPI report to me is a moot point just being used as an excuse or a reason."
"839070","842410"," So they've taken it up high enough where they can take profit if they need to."
"843250","844970"," If they blast it up north here. "
"845190","846230"," They've done their job."
"847810","849330"," There's not much to say on this."
"849750","852410"," I can bring up the chart if you want to see it. "
"853130","854390"," I can bring it up here."
"855770","856810"," Here I'll bring it up."
"856810","858090"," Just take a look at the previous. "
"858110","861630"," I think the first time we brought this up was a year over year forecast."
"861990","868670"," That's 6.5%. And they say we estimate the December CPI inflation at a still alleviated 6.5% year"
"868670","869410"," over year."
"869410","872050"," However, gasoline prices are now essentially flat. "
"872430","872490"," Yeah."
"874890","875650"," Right here."
"876070","876290"," So. "
"884590","885830"," We'll bring this up for you."
"885910","886350"," This is the same."
"886490","887610"," We've had this chart up for. "
"888290","888970"," I don't know."
"889190","890370"," Week or two or something like that."
"892210","893710"," Since before we got here. "
"894270","894890"," Start to put up."
"895410","896650"," And look where we went."
"898330","899470"," We went up right. "
"900930","902370"," So nothing's really changed here."
"902370","902550"," Right."
"902550","905730"," They're coming into with a short 4.0. 6.5. C is. "
"906810","909250"," TPM Morgan saying they're coming in to sell this."
"909650","913570"," So you should be expecting Jamie Diamond at some point."
"914330","915670"," To either come in and say. "
"917350","921010"," Jay knows that they're going to come in and say, well, we're long this market for a little while"
"921010","921370"," longer."
"921890","925930"," Or you're going to expect an interview from him coming out and saying, we're short this market and"
"925930","928230"," he'll turn this market around whenever he feels like it, right?"
"935030","939370"," So 10 minutes away now to get the US CPI year over year forecast six spot."
"939430","940090"," You know what we're saying?"
"940250","940410"," I am. "
"940530","942370"," We kind of knew there's one coming that way."
"942570","944590"," We were range of six spot eight before it happened."
"944590","945150"," Six spot. "
"945310","945490"," Three."
"945550","949750"," One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, seven, zero spot."
"949950","951530"," One percent on a prior zero spot. "
"951710","952270"," One percent."
"952590","953830"," Three percent."
"954750","955070"," Three percent. "
"955130","955830"," Three percent."
"962870","963230"," Three percent."
"963230","967390"," With a range of six percent to five spot six percent and the USaths. "
"967690","970110"," Susan for a month or a month forecast zero spot."
"970310","974930"," Three percent on a prior zero spot, two percent with a range of zero spot, six percent to zero"
"974930","977150"," spot, two percent and the US initial job."
"977290","979130"," Practice two hundred and fifteen. "
"979510","984470"," A prior two hundred and four K with a range of two hundred and forty one K to a hundred"
"984470","990570"," nine 50 K and the US continue jobless claims for cost one spot seven zero nine million."
"990890","992670"," Or for one spot six nine."
"1009470","1015850"," So just taking a look at the notes from a few investment banks of Wells Fargo, the CPI year of"
"1015850","1023890"," year forecast at 6.3% and they say we estimate CPI to 0.2% in December, bringing the"
"1023890","1031210"," year of year rate down to a 14 month low of 6.3%. They say we expect another sizable decline"
"1031210","1037510"," in energy prices, the monthly average retail price of gasoline about 12.7% from November, we're"
"1037510","1041150"," talking about that, two-way on the headline and offset. "
"1041410","1045690"," How good is that going on, of course, we trade out part of our range, not down, we can talk"
"1046430","1047450"," about a Twitter now."
"1048110","1051530"," Every week you guys are still up and you see, I was on 20% and I'm like, he's got"
"1051530","1055010"," these people are talking about everything that we've already talked about before the game talked"
"1057330","1057770"," about."
"1057770","1063530"," While we believe that shelter inflation is close to its peak, continuing strong gains in the price"
"1063530","1068830"," of other core services can really pump the brakes on progress towards 2% inflation. "
"1069490","1079200"," How about having a strong G, their forecast for the CPI year of years at 6.6% and they"
"1079200","1084740"," say markets are currently split on one of these egg raised by 25 basis points or 50 basis points in"
"1084740","1091120"," the federal open market committee meeting, given the softer weight situation, which is another"
"1091120","1098560"," softish CP, core CPI print, 0.3% of our month over month or below, the case for a 25"
"1098560","1103780"," basis point height at the February FMC versus a 50 basis point is like there's a range."
"1112330","1117770"," We'll look at, see you guys are staying in the chat here."
"1121370","1127070"," More than all of you out there by the way, and we can apologize if you get to call you"
"1127070","1131310"," a statement to call and talk to your brother, and a whole bunch of crazy stuff to tell you. "
"1137020","1139600"," I don't know why this is such a big event, it shouldn't be."
"1143420","1146080"," Hell yeah, good morning Richard, how's everybody doing?"
"1147760","1149720"," Yeah, Vic's got crushed in the overnight, I saw that."
"1154290","1156730"," Real good morning, rolled that shit over. "
"1157990","1160130"," Four, seven, one, six, five, nine, pledge garage."
"1161270","1164750"," Those gaps down there will eventually fill, measure, move up, should be very quite high from here,"
"1164790","1165270"," very extended."
"1166250","1167830"," Morning cook, sweet D, how are you?"
"1168230","1168970"," Let me go through all of your stuff. "
"1169550","1172110"," Morning Gerald, good morning Johnny, good morning FaZe on, morning Winky."
"1172910","1173710"," Morning smart man."
"1176870","1178150"," Go straight vertical. "
"1178530","1184070"," Yeah, I don't know if it should go straight, but we spent, there's a one big difference here is"
"1184070","1188030"," that banks bought this, this isn't retail."
"1188610","1198150"," So even if they drive it higher to grab, to grab up a short position would make sense."
"1202620","1207040"," Even if they sell here, they're already winning. "
"1208920","1214660"," You know, retail sold out way back on the first of the year, or the second or third of the"

"5502400","5509760"," rate how to create i guess it's simple people are like oh it's just a two minus ten or a"
"5509760","5513500"," sum but you guys probably i know some of you guys whenever you fucking look at it so i'll just"
"5513500","5522300"," show it to you there is an there is an aspect of front running there is an aspect of front"
"5522300","5531000"," running the fed funds rate being paused or the terminal rate coming into a pause trying to kind of"
"5531000","5538080"," front run that at some point this year uh and not many people talk about the front running of the"
"5538080","5548080"," fed pause or fed uh lowering rates and there's a usually a a point of time where that happens where"
"5548080","5555420"," you'll get like a um you'll get a front run from institutions and so we'll we'll look at that in"
"5555420","5561380"," previous history today we'll build that out for you today so that you have it in your tool chest"
"5561380","5566340"," you can come back to it at some point and say i want to look at this again because there's"
"5566340","5572460"," two main points here right the first point is unemployment is not high enough we know that the"
"5572460","5578160"," recession is kind of coming at some point we know that the fed is going to pause or or get"
"5578160","5585860"," to a terminal rate that'll lead to a pause down the road there is debate on when do we have"
"5585860","5591160"," that capitulation move we have there's there's we're at four thousand basically right with hand"
"5591160","5598300"," grenades and horseshoes we just slapped three ninety eight seventy seven so if they had that one"
"5598300","5604720"," more crash this year we know they're going to attempt to do it once either in the spring the fall"
"5604720","5614380"," or january of 2024 so it's like a manufactured crash right if we crash now 800 points"
"5614380","5622440"," they could write a story to you and tell you can tell you the stupid story um that we had"
"5622440","5631920"," another crash uh twenty percent puts us at three not twenty five hundred not fifteen hundred um so"
"5631920","5638400"," there's all that and then uh there's the probability that we're going to trade sideways and up for"
"5638400","5644660"," the rest of this year uh there's a probability that uh even if we did have that crash for three"
"5644660","5651120"," thousand bank spot thirty five hundred so um yeah we want to look though for when that's going to"
"5651120","5659000"," happen what can predict that happening um and how you can check in on it every month or so every"
"5659000","5666020"," quarter and see if we're making progress towards uh that last capitulation move we're more than"
"5666020","5671440"," likely we're going to have it this year uh and i wouldn't think it would happen any later than"
"5672540","5680870"," january at twenty four uh but i don't see it being deeper than i did before we were at like"
"5680870","5685710"," three forty five i was like i was like yeah there's a real chance of it like when may if"
"5685710","5694630"," we had it may if we had continued the way we were continuing um i i could have seen those"
"5694630","5700050"," lower numbers though the probability we became higher of those lower numbers but they're definitely"

"5725210","5729970"," percent and they run every down there is about two percent and the Dow is flat and they they fully"
"5729970","5738630"," believe that they can um trade this market uh they don't care if it breaks so you're seeing that"
"5738630","5746030"," real time right now with where we are on the market why we're here we are here and um that"
"5746030","5753050"," unless they unless they actually break it you probably won't see those lower numbers now they're"
"5753050","5760890"," setting it up for us not to break it or that their belief is that they won't break it so"

"8198959","8204740"," is showing us that let me see if i can get out of this real quick so c has we're"
"8204740","8211420"," coming above here and this uh hourly velocity is still so you can show the hourly here some reason"

"8221360","8228219"," above here and hourly velocity is staying high right now if you look in the right hand side we're"
"8228219","8237600"," above point three right now and so we want to see if the bears are going to step in see"
"8237600","8244260"," if they can show it to you in a better frame right here and you can see uh we're beginning"
"8244260","8249900"," the trade higher here the velocity is starting to come back in a play when we get above this orange"
"8249900","8255240"," line right here and you can see velocity is still cranking right now there's a chance that we"
"8255240","8262600"," squeeze higher here real quick bears get squeezed out so we get rid of this move this back down um"
"8262600","8272459"," bears do not want hold on a second dang it bears do not want to give this"
"8272459","8282270"," up here so bears need to if bears do not give this up here bears"

"8293910","8301150"," give this up they must stay in control here and if they do not it's going to be it's going"
"8301150","8306950"," to be a fucking problem and there is a ton of velocity coming to coming in here like that ton"
"8306950","8316549"," so i'd be really wary of being short here for the moment um you will see a squeeze higher here"
"8316549","8326500"," if the if you know if you start seeing these bulls take over here see how we're getting we're just"

"8357420","8360820"," you a little bit more just don't give it to the bears here but in the economy you do not"
"8360820","8367180"," want to find this little squeeze down in these feet this will squeeze big time into the bell so"

"8470790","8477770"," convincing by the bears here and i think that's the point is this is not convincing by bears bears"
"8477770","8482570"," needed to hold this structure down here the fact that bears couldn't hold this structure down here"
"8482570","8506740"," is not good for bears let's see"

"8607190","8616730"," this is um this is at least at least for i mean bears need to you"
"8616730","8623370"," have to stop the velocity of this move higher you have to defend the position not you but you know"
"8623370","8633070"," if you're an institution you have to because the power of that buy back there was viewed for bulls"
"8633070","8645340"," you have to get underneath you have to fight change trend in here you"
"8645340","8650380"," don't want to see this right here you don't want to see this is the hourly you don't want to"

"15472130","15479470"," selling and the banks were buying in this time period and I remember I was scared right in here but"

"15496710","15506010"," you've got JPM up here saying they're going to sell okay this is a real concern here this is like"
"15506010","15513290"," that next stage right and we're in a rotational phase right now so we have this move up here right"

"15529950","15536990"," previous level okay so we're looking for some acceptance in here but there's something else going"
"15536990","15543670"," on the background that I want you to be hyper aware of and that is that you have moving averages"
"15543670","15553590"," on multiple timeframes not shown here that are screaming higher so if you were looking this"
"15553590","15558850"," is a two hour let's see we're looking at a one hour chart a one minute chart well on higher"
"15558850","15565410"," timeframes like five minute 15 minute one hour for our day a week a month believe it or not right"
"15565410","15572790"," these moving averages are are behind the scenes you can't see him on this on this time frame but"
"15572790","15581890"," there are some massive massive moving averages coming up below here so what does that mean for you"
"15581890","15590830"," as a market participant well it means that if bears can't sell this right can't sell this down"
"15590830","15595310"," below and these moving averages keep coming up though they're not shown on a normal chart if they"
"15595310","15603270"," keep coming up like this right even if charm in Vanna wears off you'll get this real buying real"
"15603270","15608250"," like you have real money or real money selling that Vanna and charm and Gama can't account for this"
"15608250","15614410"," one so dealers run about eight to nine percent of the market so they can move price of a stock"
"15614410","15620550"," with eight ten percent of the options market okay and then you've got banks they control about"
"15620550","15630150"," seventy eight percent of the real money in the market retail controls like 25 to 30"
"15630150","15637690"," percent okay somewhere in there so you can have you can have moves in the market where we were like"
"15637690","15642430"," Spock and might tell you yeah we should hold here today but we end up blasting down you go why"
"15642430","15651090"," did that happen right and the same on the inverse can happen here on when they buy the market now"
"15651090","15659510"," when you have all these all all these other time frame moving averages coming up from behind if we"
"15659510","15669050"," start to go into a weekly where we have more buyers and sellers on the weekly trigger right and"
"15669050","15674610"," velocity is is rising this is the velocity down below and then you've got we start to break above"
"15674610","15682430"," certain levels you're actually going to see us blast up to then the monthly level and you start to"
"15682430","15689590"," see this velocity kind of play here and you can trade even higher than that now we know JPMs over"
"15689590","15693670"," here wanting to sell this market though there's a high chance they'll come out at some point at"
"15693670","15699870"," four or six and there's a chance this doesn't play out but even if JPMs gonna sell into this with"
"15699870","15706490"," strength if they're gonna be like I'm selling I'm selling there is some some momentum back here"
"15706490","15712030"," that they might not be able to overcome so you have to be aware of that even if you're like"
"15712030","15720650"," taking a position here that there there is a propensity I want to show it to you on an email"
"15720650","15731490"," it has a really good job of explaining this I'm gonna bring"
"15731490","15738390"," it up in here you know spy was a little weak today but it is moving up okay and this"
"15738390","15744630"," white line right here right this is the price of spy and this purple line right here if you see"
"15744630","15754530"," this purple line let me show you the this is the hourly trigger right here that that's"
"15754530","15760770"," the hourly trigger that's the daily trigger right this is the monthly or weekly triggers right here"
"15760770","15766170"," and this is the monthly trigger this is the big boy right here right that big purple one that's up"
"15766170","15772450"," there and you see the price is coming up right and you see you see the purple line is underneath"
"15772450","15778870"," the blue line is coming underneath and you can actually see the yellow and the purple or the dark"
"15778870","15784430"," orange line coming underneath then you've got different velocities you've got the monthly velocity"

"27162570","27164210"," Looks like people are Pacted in for today."
"27166130","27169850"," So we're going to give you Expectations for this week."
"27183110","27185390"," You guys really don't need to see this right here. "
"27185510","27200130"," But what I'm going to tell you is this is that a close about 397 is A"
"27200130","27202490"," little bit of a roll going on here in the hourly."
"27203770","27206530"," I'm going to expect us to flatten out into Friday."
"27209530","27211670"," You know Friday's go around here. "
"27211850","27214710"," I'm hoping that Friday's not really going to be too big of a day."
"27215650","27217090"," There's an expected move tomorrow."
"27217090","27224490"," I believe it's up to 400 and then down to 392 into the close tomorrow. "
"27224850","27228930"," You know, I'm going to expect 400 to print on Friday."
"27229470","27232690"," So 400 see some spreads in here into tomorrow."
"27232710","27233290"," I'd like to see that. "
"27233370","27234830"," Maybe we're weak into the close."
"27235670","27240350"," Looked to buy 396 hopefully into the open tomorrow."
"27240990","27244230"," Tag 400 and then slow bleed off or sideways. "
"27244690","27247670"," I'm hoping that Friday is kind of like the normal Friday, right?"
"27247870","27249390"," We have that one quick move in the morning."
"27249790","27251570"," And the rest of the day is kind of a sideways trade."
"27251710","27253170"," But we haven't been left with that much of that. "
"27253770","27260070"," With that being said, with that being said, we are close to the JPM caller above here."
"27260810","27265450"," We are seeing a lot of selling into strength here."
"27265870","27270610"," And so just in the next we got we got two or three things coming up. "
"27270610","27278530"," We've got people that are going to get positioned for a roll over some point down the road in the"
"27278530","27279090"," year season."
"27280590","27286310"," But truth be told, I'm going to expect sideways, at least for the next couple of weeks in here."
"27289030","27293510"," That range is somewhere around this 406 and possibly down to this 385. "
"27294450","27297590"," This wouldn't shock me at all into the next couple of weeks."
"27298170","27305630"," So for tomorrow, if it was me, if I was trading, if I was, well, if they didn't take a"
"27305630","27311390"," single trade, I considered some trades, but it looks like we're just getting some acceptance above"
"27311390","27311950"," here, right?"
"27312190","27316490"," If you look back, then close this up over here."
"27321210","27323470"," If you just look back in time here, right?"
"27323610","27327390"," We've traded now higher to a previous trading area here. "
"27328670","27330010"," We did have some weakness."
"27330410","27335750"," You know, the banks bought back up in here and they're parking us right back up into this zone."
"27336090","27338970"," It would not start to announce to the early mark to unclose imbalance again. "
"27340050","27343890"," But not shocked me to see some kind of a trade like this into next week."
"27344550","27347610"," And then of course, you know, bears are going to want to get some good positioning above."
"27348130","27351950"," I'm going to be looking for some positioning above to take this lower. "
"27352250","27358930"," If I can't get that positioning below to see this big blue line, we start to roll this over either"
"27358930","27360350"," tonight or into tomorrow."
"27360710","27366630"," I'll be looking to take some kind of a position into middle of March, probably dated for June or"
"27366630","27367470"," something like that."
"27367910","27369370"," So I'm starting to get bearish here. "
"27369370","27369890"," It's not."
"27370270","27370910"," It's not."
"27371910","27372470"," It's not. "
"27372610","27373090"," It's not today."
"27373310","27375290"," It's not this week or even next week."
"27376090","27380350"," But I'm starting to get ready to position for some kind of a role. "
"27380530","27384150"," You know that you also know or should know that."
"27384490","27385130"," Let me see."
"27385170","27387630"," I bring up two things here. "
"27387950","27389550"," We'll bring up SPX."
"27391330","27392370"," We have the problem."
"27392370","27395770"," Probably half of the JPM caller. "
"27396390","27397330"," Has it been accurate?"
"27397770","27400650"," Yes, for the past 13 months it has."
"27401250","27404570"," Have we been accurate coming up this past nine trading days?"
"27404790","27405970"," Yes, we have been accurate."
"27407350","27412450"," So unless something changes, someone mentioned, I think it was a bear bear man or something"
"27412450","27416010"," mentioned earlier that he's going to be expecting Friday. "
"27417110","27420310"," Jamie Diamond probably coming out and saying some kind of nonsense that."
"27421170","27428170"," He sees 22% down in the first quarter of 2023 and that's going to bring in bring in."
"27429330","27431850"," Sellers in here at some point, right, which we've already seen today. "
"27432130","27436970"," I've had lots of buyers today, but you're going to expect this kind of kind of a thing heading into"
"27436970","27439890"," the end of the major tech earnings."
"27441670","27443010"," Major Dow Jones."
"27444250","27444690"," Waiters. "
"27445190","27449090"," And so we'll be looking for that into into the next few weeks here."
"27449630","27453850"," And the only other thing I'd say to you here would be on the spy."
"27458290","27460610"," You know, everyone's watching the 200 up here. "
"27461390","27463430"," But truth is, I'm not really watching it."
"27463590","27467210"," I have, you know, I heard someone earlier say that they love."
"27469050","27470730"," Elliott waivers and I do too. "
"27471910","27473430"," But truth be told."
"27474210","27475750"," I've seen them be wrong."
"27475890","27476730"," I like the concept. "
"27476970","27479370"," I don't like the idea of being committed to it."
"27480010","27481570"," More of a price action trader."
"27482470","27486490"," And I really like oversold over bought conditions. "
"27487070","27490290"," I never seem to go wrong with oversold and over bought conditions."
"27491290","27491670"," Ever."
"27492750","27499730"," Like nine, like you're talking like 28 to 29 times out of 30 rather than focusing on price. "
"27500510","27502390"," I'm looking for oversold over bought."
"27502390","27504830"," And we're starting to get along the tooth up here, right?"
"27506070","27510630"," So, you know, this is showing you that that I'm getting a little bit bearish here."
"27510730","27511990"," Does that mean that we can't go up?"
"27512070","27512870"," You can see right here. "
"27513090","27515730"," We rotated from here all the way up here."
"27515870","27518990"," So if I'm starting to get bearish up here."
"27521250","27526070"," That's telling you that, you know, if I'm going to put a bearish position on, how much time does"
"27526070","27526650"," put on it?"
"27526650","27529810"," Because you know, it tops rather than bottoms. "
"27530010","27533310"," We have this, you know, I'm a bull trying to buy a bottom."
"27533470","27534550"," It's very easy typically."
"27535010","27540630"," It's usually in some kind of capitulation, but oftentimes when we're at a top, that roll takes some"
"27540630","27541030"," time. "
"27542210","27547690"," So even though I'm starting to become bearish, you know, if it takes two weeks, three weeks, fine"
"27547690","27548110"," with that."
"27548310","27553930"," If we see some kind of a move where we're just rotating for earning season."
"27555030","27558270"," I have to account for that in my bearishness, right?"
"27558770","27561510"," Sometimes people come back and they'll say, a cap, you're still bearish. "
"27561550","27562290"," You're still bearish."
"27562370","27563070"," You're still bearish."
"27563530","27566250"," And we're trading like this over here, right?"
"27566990","27569810"," You know, you have to account and build that into. "
"27570010","27577970"," So if I say I'm going to buy some June or some, some June, um, reverse or quadruped triple"
"27577970","27584990"," leverage, uh, inverse ETF to Dow shorts or Dow, Dow logs, I guess over here, you know, you have to"
"27584990","27588670"," have some patience with that kind of stuff and let them play out for themselves."
"27588830","27591670"," You can always trade this up when you enter a position like that."
"27592110","27594510"," Um, so just know that I'm starting to get bearish here. "
"27595230","27597650"," Uh, not bearish for the end of the world or anything like that."
"27598030","27602530"," Uh, but I am starting to look for, for something like this right in here, right?"
"27603350","27605190"," Um, looking for something like that."
"27605190","27611070"," How much doom and death and destruction destruction in here is, is unknown at this point. "
"27611330","27616330"," We saw a much higher, uh, higher low that came in to play here."
"27616930","27622390"," Uh, another neat part about this is if you had taken a short position here and came down in here,"
"27622390","27625910"," we were actually able to recognize that we weren't getting the role here."
"27625990","27627630"," We knew that we weren't getting the role here. "
"27628090","27632190"," Uh, so you could have cut your short there and traded this higher and then look for that new"
"27632190","27633410"," position lower over here."
"27633410","27636670"," Uh, so just in tomorrow."
"27637270","27640210"," Uh, I would welcome a, I would welcome a sell off. "
"27640590","27644510"," If, if we got a sell off, I'd be more bullish, uh, tomorrow."
"27646090","27648250"," Uh, but otherwise we'd be looking to buy a dip tomorrow."
"27648910","27654510"," And try, try to take this dip up into the belt tomorrow for 400, get some juice for a run"
"27654510","27654690"," iron. "
"27655390","27660510"," Um, we'll see it right here, but it's still retesting down below here."
"27661990","27662710"," Still retesting."
"27663030","27664450"," Maybe a possible role over tomorrow. "
"27664450","27666210"," We'll see how it goes."
"27667410","27668730"," I'm going to bring this back for you."
"27671310","27672690"," I'm just in the five minute for you. "
"27674010","27675630"," And then actually I want to buy, see this how I get."
"27675790","27677990"," I want to buy, now I want to buy this clothes if we can get lower."
"27679130","27681170"," Um, I want to buy this clothes in tomorrow, possibly. "
"27684740","27686560"," You guys have any questions for me going tomorrow?"
"27689680","27692780"," Uh, by Lewis Diamond says down."
"27692780","27697620"," Oh, it was a watch 50 week MA moving average."
"27697620","27702180"," Tommy Thornton suggested banks to go down with exhaustion signals, many banks of resistance levels. "
"27702700","27708800"," Yeah, you know, uh, the one thing I'll say about the banks is, uh, so, well, there are two things"
"27708800","27715580"," I'll say about the banks is that, uh, number one, uh, Jamie Diamond, man."
"27715820","27717360"," I'm going to expect to come out and say that shit."
"27717700","27718940"," He's ready to short the market. "
"27719360","27721320"," Uh, he says anything other than that."
"27721320","27727320"," Um, and then the other thing is look at this ramp, right?"
"27728660","27733960"," This is, remember we talked about, uh, thanks being, uh, run up."
"27736240","27741080"," In anticipation of, uh, earning season and you see it right here, right?"
"27741840","27743900"," I mean, you know what kind of. "
"27744740","27755050"," You do know what kind of, um, ER you're going to need to, you know,"
"27755110","27757370"," kind of ER season you're going to need for."
"27758630","27760810"," Like even if you got a rant, let's say you got a."
"27761970","27763350"," See, this is interesting."
"27763790","27766150"," Running right into ER season. "
"27766150","27766950"," Look where we are."
"27767110","27769550"," I'm going to bet that the implied move for tomorrow is somewhere there."
"27770850","27776090"," So even if we had a green bar up tomorrow, even if we had like a great, great bank ER,"
"27776530","27779090"," uh, Friday into the weekend. "
"27779090","27780330"," So you go up here."
"27780450","27781310"," It doesn't, it doesn't really matter."
"27781510","27786090"," You're still going to see, um, usually profit taking, right?"
"27786910","27791450"," So if these, if people have been long for the past, uh, uh, it's October, right?"
"27792110","27794070"," And even if you get this ramp up. "
"27795270","27796150"," Into ERs."
"27797370","27799610"," You're still looking at profit taking, right?"
"27800010","27800470"," Does that make sense?"
"27801590","27804010"," Uh, so I'd be wary of like calling it tomorrow."
"27804950","27806690"," Uh, if we green bar it up. "
"27806690","27810790"," Uh, I'd be looking as a, as a seller here, right?"
"27811070","27815670"," Either on tomorrow's reports or, uh, depending on how, how high they go."
"27816210","27820750"," Or however brief they go, uh, being able to position for a farther out time frame."
"27821310","27824250"," Uh, so you're going to be giving the market a chance. "
"27825030","27828050"," Uh, at least the start of earning season."
"27828410","27832930"," Give the market a chance, uh, to do the reporting, especially the majors."
"27833930","27835750"," And look for some positioning. "
"27836350","27841510"," Uh, for, uh, especially with the, with specific people talk about in their earnings."
"27841910","27846350"," You want to hear with, with the bank, uh, people are saying about their expectations, their"
"27846350","27849550"," guidance coming into, um, the first quarter of the year."
"27849870","27852570"," If you hear Jamie Diamond get more bullish. "
"27853170","27855790"," Just know that he's sitting there waiting to sell."
"27856510","27858470"," They did put out a note this week."
"27859070","27862570"," I read our note that I read from not last week's note that I posted. "
"27863190","27866350"," But I did read JPM's note from one of their notes from this week."
"27866370","27869390"," They had one that they canceled this week, but they did have another note."
"27870010","27871390"," And they, they were slightly bullish. "
"27872090","27877590"," Uh, they were, they were open to the, or they were open to the suggestion that we will."
"27877870","27879390"," Of the small possibility."
"27880170","27883350"," That we will bypass a recession, believe it or not. "
"27883570","27884610"," I don't believe that."
"27885250","27887090"," Um, but they were slightly more."
"27887090","27890850"," Uh, or less hawkish when they have been in the past. "
"27892450","27894330"," Uh, so we'll look for them for report."
"27895030","27899170"," I don't like to trade, uh, earnings like trade the run ups or they sell downs and earnings."
"27899670","27903750"," Whenever I see a company that trades down into earnings, not always, but. "
"27904230","27906710"," Uh, sometimes it does spell more doom and death."
"27907470","27911650"," Um, but whenever I see run ups like this, I want enough."
"27911830","27913430"," I want to take the trade back here. "
"27914090","27915710"," Uh, on these run ups, right?"
"27915710","27921310"," And, uh, we have seen some risk put on into tech, but it's been cautious risk."
"27921810","27922630"," Uh, in tech."
"27922990","27928590"," So, uh, I think Jamie diamond, you, you know, the thing to do is just be flat. "
"27929430","27932590"," And check in on the, uh, reports that are given."
"27932870","27936570"," Cause they're going to be a bell weather for what to expect down the road."
"27936730","27942170"," You guys know it's always better to react than it is to act or try to predict. "
"27942890","27944050"," There's no need to predict."
"27944730","27947350"," That's better to have the market show you where it wants to go."
"27947790","27950990"," Um, so just on, just the bank ERs. "
"27951350","27953070"," I don't know what else to tell you on that stuff."
"27953610","27956030"," Uh, the, the trade was back here, right?"
"27956210","27957030"," Trade was back here."
"27957550","27958990"," You know, the trade was back here. "
"27959350","27961390"," You know that the trade was back over here."
"27961810","27963150"," Now we've talked about this side."
"27963350","27963690"," Nauseam. "
"27964070","27967030"," If the market, let's say the market rolls here."
"27967150","27970010"," Let's say the, let's say Jamie diamond comes in tomorrow and he's like."
"27970670","27971470"," I don't know. "
"27972390","27975390"," Market's going to, you know, doom and die, right?"
"27976010","27979770"," Not like it's going to bounce here and start making all time new highs."
"27979970","27984370"," If he says something like that, you're going to get, you know, a, a sell off and then you're going"
"27984370","27984930"," to get time."
"27985470","27988210"," You're going to get time to reenter this. "
"27988370","27992150"," You can even go sideways and then you'll get time to actually enter this trade."
"27993070","27994290"," To sell off down the road."
"27994450","27995590"," Just have some patience right now. "
"27995790","27997490"," Let these companies come out and do their thing."
"27999050","28000270"," And look for some positioning."
"28000590","28005130"," You know, if we sell, if we, if we crank higher, you have a great place to take a, take"
"28005130","28005770"," a short position. "
"28007430","28010890"," So be, I'd always prefer a reactionary on these trades here."
"28011390","28016050"," If you didn't get into them, you want to be selling strength into late comers, right?"
"28016830","28019710"," You want to close your calls yesterday, take the money and run."
"28019890","28022030"," You notice that we didn't do anything today in the market. "
"28022650","28029370"," So, yeah, like predicting what, what, what, what finance does tomorrow for earnings."
"28029870","28033290"," I don't know why that we even give those predict why those predictions are even given."
"28035490","28037550"," It's just, I'd wait for them to come out. "
"28038350","28046090"," You give one, two, three, maybe some weakness into tomorrow's open and then you make it another"
"28046090","28046630"," push higher."
"28048510","28049990"," I should say one, two, three, four, five there."
"28055470","28058170"," Right in the 13th, Jason says over the cliff, we go. "
"28060110","28064370"," I will be here tomorrow, but not less."
"28064730","28066850"," I won't be on stream unless something gets crazy."
"28067330","28067710"," I'll be here. "
"28067770","28068470"," I'm working in the background."
"28068730","28071170"," I've got some meetings tomorrow again and through the weekend."
"28072090","28072530"," Oh, yeah. "
"28072710","28075630"," That was a nice call on our, you know, if you look at all, that's a funny thing, right?"
"28075830","28077850"," So the last last four."
"28079070","28081910"," Stock picks I've had are all green, right?"
"28082890","28084250"," All four of them, right?"
"28084830","28092290"," TD, RVMD, four, and BBBY."
"28092590","28094030"," That's 100% hit rate. "
"28095030","28097110"," BBBY went up 400%."
"28097110","28098650"," RVMD was what?"
"28098930","28099990"," 20, 30%."
"28099990","28103590"," And I know that I'm up on the other two. "
"28103810","28104670"," So that's a, what's that?"
"28104890","28105970"," MVP status, right?"
"28107530","28110130"," Those are the last four stock picks I've given you."
"28110130","28111190"," Have all been winners."
"28111390","28115730"," All four have been winners. "
"28116070","28116310"," So thanks."
"28116510","28117890"," I appreciate you saying something about that."
"28118670","28121210"," I used to do them more frequently than I do now. "
"28121470","28123770"," We're going to get back into doing them again."
"28124610","28130030"," I have someone I was just on the phone with that I'm going to show how to pick stocks."
"28131230","28132630"," What I do to pick stocks. "
"28133810","28137310"," And when I used to do them all the time, it was banging."
"28137310","28138350"," And they were always hitting."
"28139710","28142090"," So we're for this year for 2023. "
"28142490","28144490"," We didn't do as much of that last year."
"28144790","28146910"," So there have been some."
"28147170","28148390"," So what I've noticed is this. "
"28148810","28150610"," So last year, it's a good question."
"28150870","28154050"," Or are you bringing that because last year, right?"
"28157290","28158250"," Last year."
"28159490","28162030"," I would run my, I was just talking to a guy. "
"28162190","28163570"," I run my, my stock scanners."
"28164670","28169050"," If I'm looking for a short, I'll look for, I'll run my stock scanner."
"28170250","28172670"," Looking for shorts when we're, when strength. "
"28172990","28174330"," So like right now when we're strong."
"28175530","28178210"," I'm looking for tickers that are not participating."
"28179030","28181130"," In strength for a short. "
"28181570","28185350"," And then when we're weak, I'm looking for tickers that are not participating."
"28186110","28187710"," With the selling in the market."
"28188230","28191470"," And 2022 man, it was across the board. "
"28191470","28192930"," Tickers were getting hammered."
"28193770","28195970"," Only in the past couple months."
"28197350","28198630"," Two, three, like October. "
"28199330","28203310"," Have I seen even when we're going down, I'll see some stocks not participating."
"28204150","28207610"," So this year, if we, if we trade sideways or up, either or."
"28208770","28212790"," Whenever we're selling off, you will see me posting. "
"28213650","28216610"," Stock pits, never a falling knife."
"28217530","28221930"," Always a stock that's being accumulated while the market is selling."
"28222930","28227070"," These are all companies that are three year IPOs. "
"28227770","28229250"," I've been within the last three years."
"28229970","28235290"," All have to have made 30% year over year profits."
"28236290","28237290"," There's a whole bunch of shit. "
"28238010","28240070"," And they always have to be, they all have to be accumulating."
"28240830","28243230"," None of them are like bouncing, none of them are knife catching."
"28244330","28248890"," You know, you'll be, you guys are going to start getting those at some point in a newsletter. "
"28250530","28253210"," You got winky's going to be doing some stuff for us as well."
"28254650","28256450"," So you'll be, you'll be seeing more."
"28257490","28260950"," You're going to get, you're going to start getting some contacts and content around here. "
"28262310","28268630"," Like actionable content on a consistent basis with a, with a team of people."
"28272630","28273890"," Remember those golden tickets?"
"28274370","28274670"," Remember that?"
"28276930","28277410"," Yeah."
"28277650","28278750"," So thoughts on Tesla. "
"28280290","28280770"," Yeah."
"28280850","28281550"," Take it easy, David G."
"28284300","28284780"," Yeah."
"28285020","28289640"," So we've been running tests and beta tests on newsletters and daily briefs and stock picks. "
"28290100","28294280"," And so now we're putting the team together and we're launching a new website."
"28295520","28298560"," And it's, it's, it's cost a lot of money in it."
"28299060","28302380"," And I've got developers working in the background trying to get you guys some tools. "
"28303220","28312120"," It's time tools, money and time tools, money and making sure everybody's doing the right thing."
"28312300","28316780"," Like when you're, when you're launching something like this, it takes time for me to spend time"
"28316780","28318400"," with people so that they know."
"28319300","28324980"," Or I'm able to communicate with them what we're looking for, see if they can and want to do that"
"28324980","28325280"," stuff. "
"28325820","28333820"," And then we've put the systems in place so that you get a consistent, like daily brief from us."
"28333940","28336720"," You get a consistent one that is what it is, right?"
"28336940","28337220"," That works."
"28338160","28340200"," Not just some half ass put together things. "
"28340440","28341540"," So it's going to take a, take a little bit."
"28342200","28343000"," We're working on the background."
"28343440","28346160"," We should be rolling it out here in the next week or week to three weeks somewhere in there. "
"28346680","28349980"," You should start to get the service launched."
"28350960","28352240"," And I think you guys will be happy with it."
"28352240","28355960"," Now, on, on Tesla. "
"28356640","28357660"," Same thing, right?"
"28357940","28360980"," Tesla is nothing's changed since this morning in Tesla, right?"
"28361820","28366980"," So we said, what we say this morning in Tesla was that as long as they held this little green"
"28366980","28368400"," box down here, which they did, right?"
"28368940","28369560"," This was your trigger."
"28370700","28375720"," You want to see the hourly 27 EMA stay above it."
"28376640","28378220"," As long as you stay above it. "
"28379860","28382780"," Your next target is right up here at one 38."
"28383500","28386880"," We should trend up here in the next four to five days."
"28387580","28390840"," I know that people are telling you that doom and gloom is coming. "
"28391320","28395180"," If you're focused just on Tesla, you're only focused on this blue line right here."
"28396660","28401420"," Until Tesla rolls Tesla could decouple from any weakness in the market."
"28401800","28404060"," You want to stay focused on that early trend. "
"28404800","28409540"," And then if you just keep doing that, you're going to make you're going to keep just watching this"
"28409540","28410760"," and watching this and watching this."
"28411180","28414120"," If we roll over on the hourly trend, right?"
"28415420","28415960"," We're here."
"28416580","28418460"," We had any point roll over this hourly trend. "
"28418600","28421740"," You'll be looking for a rejection and then a resumption down below."
"28422240","28424160"," And the first test will be the green line."
"28424720","28427440"," That's the 176 M.A. and the one hour chart. "
"28428460","28429520"," So you just here to monitor."
"28430180","28436940"," So far, what Tesla is saying is it's going to attempt to work itself higher and try to tag 138."
"28437680","28438640"," I'm going to give it a price target. "
"28438800","28439700"," You guys know I do that."
"28439860","28441560"," You guys know I can go through."
"28441960","28446520"," Let's go through real quick and we'll look at some tickers. "
"28447260","28449180"," I know you guys."
"28449420","28449840"," Thanks for each."
"28449900","28450620"," I appreciate it. "
"28451000","28454500"," So when you guys see me out here doing this stuff day in day out, right?"
"28456880","28459900"," You know, sometimes you guys come back later and you're like, uh, captain."
"28460120","28465080"," Hey, uh, let's see if, um, they reset this thing."
"28467660","28469440"," So let's see if we can go through some of this stuff. "
"28469760","28478640"," So, uh, you know, what I'm, let me see if it's anything in here."
"28478780","28480220"," I've tried it out for you guys recently."
"28482120","28487840"," Uh, you know, there we go, right?"
"28488360","28490260"," And we're bullish into tomorrow, right?"
"28490480","28491840"," You can see down here the buy zone. "
"28492040","28494300"," You can see this new buy zone past couple days."
"28495180","28496980"," NDX price target, right?"
"28498120","28499420"," See the buy zone down below."
"28499920","28501020"," Hit our first price target. "
"28501280","28502020"," Can we go up higher?"
"28502500","28503780"," H Y G's telling you that we can."
"28504340","28506980"," We know the weekly volatility is even above here, right?"
"28507160","28508080"," That weekly moving average."
"28508480","28511980"," So if we hit this price target and move higher, we were looking at 11, 800 above. "
"28513740","28514180"," Right?"
"28514440","28516180"," Well, we did marry it recently, didn't we?"
"28516660","28517880"," We charted out met."
"28518020","28519800"," Remember we charted this one out right here?"
"28520620","28521860"," This one out right here."
"28521980","28523300"," This is, uh, Uber. "
"28523940","28527860"," You guys hate Uber and we've got a nice little clean bounce down below."
"28528420","28531420"," Clean bounce here in the one hour bounced heading higher."
"28531620","28534840"," And now we're looking at closing that trade above, right?"
"28535560","28536860"," There's another beautiful one right there. "
"28539440","28540960"," What else are we looking at down here?"
"28541060","28542340"," Did we just do marry it recently?"
"28544320","28546160"," Um, yeah, we just did marry it."
"28546160","28547540"," We'll take a look at this one."
"28549380","28550360"," Same idea, right?"
"28550500","28551140"," We crossed below. "
"28551660","28553220"," Came above the, uh, the one hour chart."
"28553360","28555420"," We just came above the green line tagging higher."
"28555420","28558080"," We have a price target above of 163 69. "
"28558820","28561280"," And we had, uh, hopefully we can buy down."
"28561460","28562780"," Remember, I was like, I don't want to buy here."
"28562780","28563500"," I want to buy down here. "
"28563740","28567080"," I didn't quite get that, but we did trade higher at any rate."
"28567480","28571720"," Uh, and if you had been trading it with the blue line here, you would have been able to jump"
"28571720","28573080"," on this and the cross on the green."
"28573080","28576460"," Uh, 176 M.A. and move higher. "
"28577720","28578600"," Uh, gold."
"28578940","28580080"," We did the same thing happen."
"28581000","28582660"," You're that beautiful gold, baby. "
"28583020","28584400"," Look at that great chart right there."
"28584800","28589400"," So when I, when I, when I guess my point to you is when I'm, uh, charting all this stuff"
"28589400","28590080"," out for you."
"28590880","28595760"," Um, it's not a matter of, you know, this isn't a game of, don't ever look at this as like"
"28595760","28597760"," a game of, oh, is this guy right?"
"28597980","28598800"," Or is that guy right?"
"28599040","28599720"," Or is this girl right?"
"28599920","28600440"," Is girl wrong?"
"28600440","28603420"," Uh, this is a, this is a, this is a job. "
"28604480","28610660"," For you to attempt to, uh, attempt to take the probable trade here."
"28611100","28611560"," Right?"
"28612260","28613900"," And then manage that trade."
"28614260","28616400"," So you guys should always have stops. "
"28616480","28619420"," You guys should always have like, what's your risk appetite?"
"28620140","28621120"," How long are you going to hold?"
"28621300","28621920"," How much are you going to lose?"
"28622540","28630400"," When does, you know, if this, like this Tesla, if you see, if you see Tesla on the hourly, you"
"28630400","28634500"," know, this blue line rolls over and you see this green line roll over, right?"
"28635200","28639620"," Over here, you know, and you see the price of Tesla start to do this."
"28639920","28643680"," You have to at some point decide, am I going to start selling calls?"
"28644380","28646980"," I'm going to deploy some, sell some calls over here."
"28647600","28649200"," Am I going to cut myself out of this?"
"28649460","28651580"," Does that make sense to you?"
"28651720","28656700"," Like you have to be able to manage your positions if you're buying the underlying, um, can you"
"28656700","28657460"," change direction?"
"28658180","28662980"," If it starts to go the wrong way, some people will sometimes buy like the underlying on Tesla here. "
"28663020","28665360"," And let's say Tesla rolled over here, right?"
"28666300","28669100"," Um, so you bought the underlying here."
"28669120","28674680"," You might have to start selling calls above or you might have to start buying puts while it trades"
"28674680","28675700"," lower, right?"
"28676020","28678800"," To protect your, uh, your underlying position."
"28679440","28682860"," Uh, so all I can do is give you guys a probable outcomes. "
"28682860","28685940"," You guys still need to, uh, want to manage the trades."
"28685940","28687500"," But this is my price target right here."
"28687520","28691540"," My guys, if we don't, if we roll over here, though, it's going to be ugly. "
"28691980","28695240"," So, um, I don't think you're going to see that roll over."
"28695520","28698600"," I think, I think you're good right now or so far."
"28698920","28701360"," So far you've got consolidation back here. "
"28701980","28703920"," Uh, you've got this nice push higher."
"28704900","28706160"," This is the second one."
"28706320","28710400"," I'd expect at least one more and the escape velocity is right around 132. "
"28711220","28715420"," You really, really need to escape this to get this last little push up."
"28715520","28716460"," The squeeze higher here."
"28720060","28721180"," It's probably less wrong. "
"28722120","28723380"," You guys have a great day."
"28725700","28728540"," Um, hey, grubster, take it easy, my brother."
"28729120","28730220"," Keep showing up, man. "
"28730320","28733060"," If you just want to hang out and talk, there wasn't really a lot to talk about today."
"28733820","28738000"," Um, so you, grubster, we're going to have some people on some interview and going on that kind of"
"28738000","28738220"," stuff."
"28740200","28741100"," Right, right on. "
"28742100","28743040"," Hey, you guys."
"28744320","28745280"," How's it going, sloth?"
"28745560","28746060"," How you doing, brother?"

"28759180","28760220"," Every little bit does help."
"28760620","28763540"," Uh, it is very expensive to put this, put this broadcast out."
"28764400","28767540"," Um, if you're a poor trader, don't ever bother tipping me. "
"28767540","28768640"," Just show up every day."
"28769060","28771940"," And, uh, we'll keep doing this for you every single day."
"28772580","28774220"," What else do I got for you guys?"
"28774760","28776620"," Uh, wet pan frame right there. "
"28777740","28779180"," And I think that's it for today."
"28779640","28781400"," Uh, I'll catch up with you guys tomorrow."
"28781400","28782280"," The stream will be up. "
"28782440","28782680"," You know what?"
"28782840","28783380"," I had a problem."
"28783820","28786380"," I meant to put the stream up the other day."
"28787100","28788480"," When I put the stream up the other day. "
"28789060","28791140"," And it was on, but it wasn't."
"28791400","28794500"," What happened was my router recepts every morning."
"28795080","28796360"," And then the same thing happened. "
"28796360","28797840"," I believe yesterday."
"28798580","28803220"," So, um, I have to like change my router time."
"28803560","28806200"," Cause I'm trying to put the steam up of like four in the morning, five in the morning. "
"28806520","28807780"," So it's just up and going."
"28809080","28815100"," Um, so I either have to start the stream just at nine or change my router reset every morning."
"28816100","28818340"," Uh, cause I run a VPN. "
"28818840","28821200"," I run a V two VPNs through my house."
"28821200","28825420"," And, um, I feel like my hope is happening."
"28825780","28830100"," I have a bunch of other shit going on, like a black server and stuff. "
"28830300","28833240"," And I just want to make sure that everything gets refreshed."
"28834920","28836120"," Every take these are brother."
"28839800","28840760"," Am I in any place?"
"28841000","28843300"," No, I've closed out my lungs on spy. "
"28844280","28845280"," It's a good question."
"28846120","28847220"," I've closed my lungs in the spy."
"28847660","28850880"," I have a own right now. "
"28850880","28852700"," I actually own, uh, Tesla."
"28853840","28856560"," And I have some calls for Tesla."
"28857520","28858600"," Uh, above. "
"28858960","28862740"," I was expecting one 50 at the I was expecting one 40 at this point."
"28863000","28865980"," Uh, I don't know if I'm going to lose those calls or not."
"28866280","28869580"," Um, some waiting for the run up into ER. "
"28869820","28874660"," And then, uh, I'm looking to take a short position on the market."
"28875120","28877440"," Uh, we're looking at spy here."
"28877440","28882660"," I'm looking for two, two possible places to buy short or to go short. "
"28882940","28885660"," I would really like to be up here, like four or two, four or four."
"28886140","28892640"," If I have to wait a week or two for a spike higher, uh, to grab something for the end"
"28892640","28893520"," of ER season."
"28894920","28898400"," Um, or if we roll, if we start rolling at any point. "
"28898920","28900540"," If we start, I'll be honest with you."
"28900600","28901980"," We start rolling at any point, right?"
"28902640","28906320"," We're going down like we're going down more than a few hundred points."
"28906320","28908540"," We'll be plenty of time to take that trade. "
"28909080","28911540"," But that is, I'm starting to get bearish, right?"
"28912160","28913200"," Starting to get bearish."
"28914360","28914780"," Yeah."
"28914920","28917980"," So we, uh, we rolling into a pretty heavy position here shortly. "
"28922270","28923410"," Bitcoin crash coming."
"28928370","28928790"," Yeah."
"28929110","28929590"," Hey, rock. "
"28929770","28934230"," So, uh, Rook would just, uh, said that he's going to check out that Ray Dalio video."
"28934230","28935590"," I do recommend it to you."
"28935710","28939910"," I didn't do the, um, the two year minus the 10 year today. "
"28939910","28941710"," I was really tired of doing this today."
"28941950","28944050"," I'll do the two year, 10 year tomorrow with you guys."
"28944170","28947710"," I want to show you guys the, uh, there's an interesting trade here. "
"28948430","28953670"," That I want to talk to you guys about where the banks are likely to front run."
"28954670","28956850"," Um, the fed fund rate."
"28958190","28960910"," Getting to a terminal rate and maybe pausing. "
"28961250","28966790"," And so the banks will try to front run, uh, selling the market when that happens."
"28966790","28973410"," And I'm going to show you some instances in the past where, uh, if the fed gets dovish and if,"
"28973510","28979970"," um, if we do get a recession when that could take place and how to use the simple tool to"
"28979970","28986190"," look for, um, where we all want, we want to see it unemployment pump as well, but we're going to"
"28986190","28992350"," be looking at the, um, uh, the inversion and seeing if we can at least keep an eye out and"
"28992350","28994630"," check out, check in on it every quarter or so."
"28994630","28998010"," Uh, to see if they front run that kind of stuff. "
"28998230","29002270"," If we ever hear like a whip of the fed being dovish."
"29003270","29006810"," Uh, I don't care if we trade like 300 points straight up."
"29006970","29007610"," We're short in the market. "
"29010370","29024810"," Yeah, we can take a look at the pretense put if you'd like to do that."
"29024890","29025170"," I love that."
"29025350","29029690"," I love those videos, by the way, high unemployment rate link to one man with 42,000 jobs. "
"29033350","29035870"," Yeah, yeah, we'll go over, we'll go over the 10 three tomorrow as well."
"29036570","29040610"," Um, it's, that's the 10, is it 10 divided by the three?"
"29045680","29047440"," Or is that 10 less than three?"
"29047560","29048060"," I can't remember."
"29049480","29050120"," Yeah, shit. "
"29050380","29051640"," Definitely a shit chart today."
"29052000","29052960"," So I'll check out with you guys tomorrow."
"29053400","29054680"," I'll see you guys in the morning. "
"29055060","29058940"," And if if there's any crazy market moves, I mean, do you think that's going to crash overnight"
"29058940","29059340"," tonight?"
"29060160","29061160"," I don't think so."
"29061560","29065960"," We can be weak into tomorrow, but is it like bloodbath city in the overnight tonight?"
"29067140","29067580"," Possible."
"29068240","29069680"," I guess anything's possible. "
"29070380","29073180"," Uh, I think they're going to try to pin this for spreads."
"29073500","29076460"," That's my guess is that they're going to pin for spreads tomorrow."
"29078080","29079140"," Okay, you guys take it easy. "
"29079260","29079940"," I'm gonna take it easy."
"29080340","29080660"," Love lobster."
"29080860","29081660"," You all take it easy today. "
"29082020","29084100"," Uh, Rook would run wild."
"29084620","29084940"," Okay."
"29085240","29085700"," Market rebel. "
"29086540","29088360"," Avery Ridge per bill Tom."
"29091400","29093640"," Oh, quite putting all of them per bill."
"29093780","29094460"," Oh, you're hilarious. "
"29095900","29097320"," DB thing would take it easy."
"29098140","29100980"," Uh, just like this, just like this trade down here."
"29101560","29103940"," Just like this trade down here took well to develop. "
"29104140","29107200"," I'm expecting the same kind of a thing up here."
"29107200","29107560"," Right?"
"29107720","29112700"," So even if you sell off one day down here, this trade was developing for this larger move higher."
"29113020","29114120"," So give it some time. "
"29114140","29116360"," Let it breathe and we'll see what happens."
"29116360","29121980"," I know who who is John Hagerty saying Friday the 13th with the axe and all that."
"29123420","29125040"," Just let the trade develop. "
"29125260","29125700"," We'll get there. "
