"RrdYZWvzPpU","0","4820"," Good morning traders."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","4820","6960"," Captain Jim James here with your daily brief."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","6960","11400"," The market is slow outside of trading opens and closes"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","11400","13880"," and alerts that I get on stocks."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","13880","15480"," There really isn't much going on."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","15480","17440"," I did speak to a friend who told me"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","17440","20640"," that there's a lot of money coming into the market right now."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","20640","24600"," Just hang tight and that is going to go up in a big way."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","24600","27120"," Now all this call consolidation that we've had,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","27120","29820"," we still might get a dip today, tomorrow,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","30300","31840"," into the end of this week."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","31840","35780"," Today we do have CPI numbers coming out at 8.30 this morning."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","35780","38020"," You can see it right down here, of course, CPI"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","38020","40140"," and then the consumer price index."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","40140","42900"," We also have claims on Thursday."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","42900","45260"," And those are really, these are really the two days"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","45260","46580"," where we're going to get some news here"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","46580","49580"," that talks about inflation and probably the best chance"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","49580","52140"," for some volatility or even the market"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","52140","55180"," pulling back a little bit, especially NASDAQ."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","55180","57180"," Let's take a look at ES today."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","57220","60180"," These numbers work as well for SPY."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","60180","63340"," Expect that we're going to test this 4424"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","63340","67780"," and then make a move down to 4423, 4415."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","68820","70820"," And if we break through here, it is possible"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","70820","74860"," we can come down and bounce off this 43.83."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","75740","79020"," This support level here is changing every day."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","79020","81860"," I think it was like 43.7 yesterday,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","82820","84300"," somewhere down in here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","84300","86700"," But as time passes, we're moving on up."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","86700","88780"," And then, of course, down below everybody,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","88780","91540"," everybody would really like to see a dip down here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","91540","94060"," We'll call this today, or let's say today"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","94060","97340"," and tomorrow, 4336."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","97340","99740"," I'm not expecting much out of ES today."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","99740","102340"," I am expecting some form of a pullback,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","102340","105460"," even though we do have on a larger timeframe."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","105460","107100"," You can see in this area here,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","107100","110460"," we've had a lot of consolidation and then more here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","110460","113620"," This looks like it's building for a larger move up,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","113620","116500"," but I still expect us to make maybe one more dip down here"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","116620","120060"," before we make that move to 450."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","120060","122500"," Later in the week, I'm gonna try to plot out"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","122500","124420"," what Goldman Sachs was saying,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","124420","126980"," that we could see 470 by end of year."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","126980","128500"," I don't think that's off the table"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","128500","132460"," for a holiday push come November and December."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","132460","135180"," And I don't think 450 is off the table either."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","135180","137700"," Maybe we make one more run to 450,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","137700","139900"," have a big sell-off end of August"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","139900","142820"," or the first couple of weeks of September,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","142820","144420"," drive that into October."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","144420","145980"," At that point, we'd be coming back down"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","145980","148860"," around 440 and we could put another 30 points"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","148860","151020"," on the board easily from that point,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","151020","155620"," let's call it mid-October to December, January 1."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","155620","157700"," It's still a reach to get to 470,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","157700","160300"," but those cards are definitely on the table."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","160300","161860"," We've already talked earlier in the week"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","161860","163700"," about infrastructure, bills,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","163700","166740"," we've talked about money coming into more stimulus,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","166740","168220"," they're gonna call it something different."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","168220","171420"," I don't think that the Fed is willing to start"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","171420","173020"," or willing to begin tapering either."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","173020","174580"," I think that might be the trigger."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","174580","177500"," If they go to, I think what is it, Wyoming or whatever"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","177500","180260"," and do their little secret meeting,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","180260","181420"," if they were to come out and say"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","181420","182980"," that they're not gonna be tapering"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","182980","186140"," or not considering taping for quite some time,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","186140","188940"," that's going to give that rip and boost to the market"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","188940","192900"," that is unexpected right now to get up to that 450."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","192900","194300"," So we'll continue to monitor this,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","194300","196580"," but today I'm gonna expect this to come down."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","196580","198620"," The market's been so slow, I really doubt"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","198620","201540"," we get this far deep into a pullback."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","201540","205900"," As you know, these pullbacks and these all-time highs,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","205900","209020"," they're like molasses, you know?"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","209020","213220"," It's really hard to be excited about this market right now."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","213220","216100"," Let's take one last closer look here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","216100","218020"," Let me get on a smaller timeframe."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","218020","222340"," I mean, this right here, this is coming from the 23rd of July"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","222340","224180"," and we are now at August 11th."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","224180","228220"," Even these pullbacks here, these are not substantial."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","228220","231140"," If you made this measure, this same measure move here"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","231140","236140"," down here to this 438.30 on the spy."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","236980","238660"," You know, this really isn't too much"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","238660","241620"," and we're really not that far off"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","241620","244900"," from this trend level down below here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","244900","247020"," You know, eventually over time,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","247020","248420"," we are going to get to the point"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","248420","251740"," where we're going up in a big way."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","251740","255100"," All this consolidation here is going to lead"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","255100","257340"," towards a rip higher."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","257340","260580"," Oh, I shouldn't say is, there is a good chance,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","260580","263460"," like good 70% chance that we're going to get"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","263460","268540"," a pretty big rip for this long of a sideways movement."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","268540","272180"," So let's say we come down here to this 438.1"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","272180","274540"," or even if we blasted through and hit right here,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","274540","277460"," at this point, I would not be holding,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","277460","281020"," or I would not be bearish below this level at this point."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","281020","284180"," You've had one long pullback."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","284180","285380"," This, believe it or not,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","285380","288540"," even though we've hit all-time highs, this is a pullback."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","289540","291180"," No matter what you want to say about it,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","291180","292540"," that's what it is."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","292540","296740"," So I would be buying any of these dips down below."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","296740","301740"," If you see anything coming down to 438, 0.37 or even deeper,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","302060","303460"," this would be sweet if you were a bull"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","303460","305900"," if you could get down this deep right here"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","305900","309420"," and then just start buying yourself some call spreads."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","309420","314220"," I do have some debit spreads on us coming down"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","314220","316300"," at some point over here,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","316300","319620"," assuming that at some point those are going to print."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","319620","322500"," So I am bearish today and probably tomorrow"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","322500","325020"," and then I'm looking for a rip much higher."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","325020","326780"," Moving on to NQ."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","326780","328300"," NQ is looking very bearish."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","328300","329900"," Let me pull this out here a little bit"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","329900","333260"," so you can get a better viewpoint as to where we are."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","333260","336500"," This is starting to look like NQ's rolling over"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","336500","339660"," some sort of a slow-moving blow-off top."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","339660","342220"," I've put some support lines down here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","342220","344780"," If we break this bottom one right here,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","344780","349500"," I would start looking for 14, 732"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","349500","353460"," and possibly even lower to this 14, 548."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","353460","356020"," We really do have a point of no return here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","356020","357540"," It's going a little bit higher over time."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","357540","361100"," It was 14, 800 earlier in the week"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","361100","364180"," and now it's somewhere around 14, 904."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","364180","368380"," But NQ profit taking is taking place."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","368380","371540"," Expect the spy to do slightly better over time"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","371580","375900"," and I believe that IWM, small caps,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","375900","378460"," is going to become the leader in the coming,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","379660","382020"," at least next two, three, four weeks."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","382020","384620"," So let's get a little bit closer on this chart here"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","384620","385980"," and see what we're looking at."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","385980","388020"," It's a good place to be looking."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","388020","391740"," So at most today, 15, 074,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","391740","394340"," although I do think we start popping"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","394340","396180"," through this trading zone here,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","396180","400100"," we might hold this 14, 900 or 14, 902"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","400100","403020"," and start to bounce around here for the next move down."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","403020","405260"," This might just be a slow bleed off"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","405260","408620"," rather than this doom and gloom"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","408620","411180"," where we just start burning straight down"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","411180","413020"," through these levels."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","413020","414900"," So for today, let's call it,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","414900","418700"," quick 15, 014 and 14, 902."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","418700","421300"," Expect a fall today into tomorrow"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","421300","423900"," and possibly even Thursday, Friday,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","423900","427380"," we bounce around and consolidate inside this area."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","427380","429540"," Now there is some consolidation in here"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","429540","432540"," and there are small admit cap tech companies"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","432540","433780"," that are still reporting"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","433780","436820"," and I think that leads to us doing the slow drop off"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","436820","439540"," rather than this big plunge."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","439540","441420"," We're gonna save that big plunge probably"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","441420","444940"," for September one, maybe even,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","444940","448540"," you could even call it 821, we have OPEC's, right?"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","448540","453100"," So you're gonna have all of this gamma leaving big tech."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","453100","454900"," So maybe you'll have that big drop off,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","454900","457500"," let's call it August 23rd."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","457500","459420"," Mark that down in your calendar."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","459420","464420"," Moving on to the Russell, ROT, RTY, the fat pig."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","464820","469060"," This guy over here has been printing machine, okay?"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","469060","471620"," Let's scale this out a little bit here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","471620","474140"," Let's just take a look at the Russell,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","474140","475660"," a larger timeframe."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","475660","477700"," We already know in a larger scale"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","477700","480420"," that the Russell's been printing like a printing machine"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","480420","481620"," since January."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","481620","483460"," If you're buying any of these dips here,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","483460","486140"," you're making some serious money."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","486140","488020"," We called out this dip here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","488020","489300"," We called out this dip here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","489300","491060"," We called out this dip here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","491060","493460"," And we're about to come into another one."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","493460","496020"," We are in this trend moving up right now,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","496020","499220"," although we are stuck in a small trading zone up in here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","499220","502780"," I am expecting a rip higher coming very soon."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","502780","506580"," You could enter some call spreads here for this move up"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","506580","509780"," or wait to see if the market dips maybe today and tomorrow."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","509780","511820"," And let's say you grab something down here"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","511820","513340"," for a push up much higher."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","513340","516580"," We'll go down to a smaller timeframe here and take a look."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","516580","519300"," So you're buying any of these dips right now,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","519300","521380"," especially if you scale into it."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","521380","523580"," Let's say you scale into this dip here today."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","523580","526460"," If the markets does start to sell off slightly,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","526460","528900"," get a little bit more aggressive and a little bit more"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","528900","530620"," aggressive and then down here, you know,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","530620","532380"," this is like hand grenades."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","532380","535800"," I'm all in going up from this point forward."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","536700","541700"," And these levels are 2100.8, 21.64, 21.93, 22.5.1."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","542700","546100"," And let's even look on the five day here"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","547540","549620"," and just see how amazing this has been."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","551100","552620"," You know, just this five day right here,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","552620","554180"," any of these touches down below,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","554180","556100"," if you buy any of these,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","556100","558340"," you're making some pretty decent money."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","558340","560260"," So you're looking for a minimum to come down here"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","560260","564620"," and touch this 22.5.1 again, or hopefully it does."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","564620","566620"," But we have a lot of consolidation here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","566620","569940"," Let me look at this as five days of wanting to go up."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","569940","572820"," So any dips below buy to take a run up."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","574780","576100"," Moving on to Tesla."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","577260","581020"," Now you've got my projections for this year and end of year."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","581020","583220"," I gave you a number of 800 and 1,000."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","583220","585100"," I still believe in that number."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","585100","587620"," And as you can see here, we, again,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","587620","589620"," if you look between this white line right here"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","589620","591260"," and this white line right here,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","591260","593220"," we've got a whole lot of pushing going on"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","593220","596040"," to get into a new trading zone for Tesla."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","597380","599100"," So I am buying these dips."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","599540","600820"," The other day on Twitter,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","600820","605820"," I let you know that I had bought some 725 call spreads"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","606420","608420"," when we got this dip down here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","608420","610900"," Now that's not really an aggressive play."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","610900","613940"," I try to scale into my trades, right?"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","613940","615980"," So if a dip comes down here,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","615980","620700"," I'm gonna buy a spread that has some leeway for it to print,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","620700","621540"," right?"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","621540","625140"," And we don't hold our spreads past 50% profitability usually."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","625140","626660"," I guess some people do."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","626660","628180"," But if you know anything about spreads,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","628180","630220"," you can make more, let's even,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","630220","632540"," let's say the stock went up to 750"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","634140","638100"," in the next few days, in the time frame,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","638100","642260"," once you're at about 50% profit on a spread,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","642260","646540"," they don't gain the rest of their profit until they expire."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","646540","648260"," So as soon as I'm close to 50%,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","648260","650940"," I'll usually sell them and re-enter a new trade"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","650940","654100"," on a spread for max gains."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","654100","657100"," Let's get back on a smaller timeframe on Tesla."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","658740","660700"," And we've talked about this as well."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","663220","665620"," So this is some established support"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","665620","668220"," that you can rely upon in the coming days, okay?"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","668220","673220"," So right right today, we're at 677 and we're at 656, right?"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","674380","676020"," We already know that we had buyer"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","676020","679580"," or demand here at this level at 698.09."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","679580","682980"," I called it, I started entering I think at 610"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","682980","685660"," and then I keep adding as we hit that 700 mark"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","685660","686740"," into the close."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","686740","689060"," And I think in the video I even said"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","689060","691860"," on my last Tesla video that I'll buy that close"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","691860","696540"," if we touch that 700, which we did the day before we rose up."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","697620","700140"," And we did see more demand come in here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","700140","702580"," So we've got demand here and demand here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","702580","705020"," What I would be recommending or what I'm going to be doing"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","705020","708620"," is if I see any further selling off of Tesla"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","708620","712260"," down to this 697 level, I'm gonna re-enter again"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","712260","714300"," and again and again down here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","714300","715860"," Tesla to me is very bullish."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","715860","718220"," I do see 750."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","718220","721420"," I'm looking for us to touch or get close to 750"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","722500","724780"," between now and the 23rd."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","724780","729020"," One thing to consider for this move up to 750"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","729020","730820"," would be call sellers, right?"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","730820","733940"," If people are selling calls at 750 thinking"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","733940","734980"," you're never gonna touch it,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","734980","736700"," they're gonna do whatever they can"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","736700","740700"," to stop us from touching 750 before the 23rd."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","740700","743660"," So maybe we come close to 750 and sell off"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","743660","748260"," once more and we come back to hit this 750."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","748260","749700"," We could draw a line here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","749700","751660"," This is definitely a possibility."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","751660","753860"," Let's say somewhere in here,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","753860","755660"," let's say we make this run up to 750"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","755660","758420"," and then we bleed off just past the 23rd"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","758420","762460"," and then jump over it coming into September, okay?"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","762460","765980"," So you wanna keep that in consideration"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","765980","767780"," as we make this run this week."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","767780","769140"," Always take profits too."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","769140","770860"," You should be scaling out of your profits"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","770860","773420"," if you're in some long calls on Tesla."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","773740","774900"," If you paid for those calls,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","774900","777220"," let's say you spent 10 grand on those calls"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","777220","778820"," and you're already up,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","778820","780460"," you should scale back on some of those"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","780460","782700"," and let the rest of them ride, you know?"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","782700","784620"," Consider that when you're playing Tesla."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","784620","786620"," But my call for Tesla right now"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","786620","789340"," is buying any dips down here at these levels."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","789340","791980"," So you already know we've got 697,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","791980","796100"," we've got 678 and we've got 660."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","796100","800220"," You should not have any issues buying these dips down here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","800220","802620"," You should never be upside down right now"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","802620","804220"," buying any of these dips down here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","804220","807340"," You should always be up on your calls and your lungs"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","807340","810740"," if you're following this dip buying strategy right now."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","810740","813460"," This dip buying strategy has worked itself out here"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","813460","816740"," for a pretty decent period of time."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","817860","821860"," You're talking about all the way back on May 21st."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","821860","824020"," So there should be no mistaking"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","824020","826820"," where you should be buying dips and riding them out."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","826820","830620"," If you are upside down in your calls on Tesla right now"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","830660","832140"," or you're losing money,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","832140","836500"," you are in properly positioning yourself"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","836500","838260"," in your calls on Tesla."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","838260","840940"," You might just want to sell and get out of them"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","840940","843220"," and rethink your strategy for entering them."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","843220","845580"," I don't want that to sound like a dickish,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","845580","846900"," it'll be dickish saying that,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","846900","850380"," but there is so much opportunity here"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","850380","855380"," to be making money rather than losing money on the way up."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","856700","860220"," Sometimes it takes that clearing the plate"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","860260","864180"," of mentality to know when to get long on Tesla."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","864180","867940"," And those opportunities have presented themselves"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","867940","869220"," like clockwork."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","869220","871500"," Good luck to you all trading Tesla today."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","871500","874100"," And even myself, I'm hoping to get one more dip"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","874100","876420"," to catch it down here or down here or down"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","876420","878220"," or yeah, these three spots right here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","878220","883220"," Moving on, we talked about spreads earlier in the week."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","883380","886700"," This market requires the use of spreads"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","886700","888700"," to make consistent gains."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","888700","890180"," This is going to be a project."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","890180","893580"," This market is difficult to navigate."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","893580","897460"," My trading strategy involves FDs,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","897460","899980"," call spreads, debit spreads,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","899980","903980"," and some swings on low volume stocks,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","903980","906020"," but I rarely do swings anymore"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","906020","909540"," because of how the market acts."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","909540","912420"," Either from low volume in the major indexes"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","912420","915180"," all the way over to high frequency trading firms"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","915180","916900"," and bots that are running the markets,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","916900","920540"," killing the intrinsic value in options over time."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","920540","923740"," Just want to quickly show you how it was going."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","923740","925940"," You can see right here that we used to have nice peaks"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","925940","930380"," and valleys in stock prices or share prices."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","930380","933740"," And then as time has passed,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","933740","937580"," our market is moving now in a more jagged fashion."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","937580","941420"," This is due to high frequency trading in the market."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","941420","944540"," And so trading one to three month out."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","944540","947700"," Swing trades has become almost fruitless."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","947700","949540"," We're hitting all time highs right now."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","949540","952780"," And if you'd bought a call 10 days ago"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","952780","953620"," that's now in the money,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","953620","955620"," I guarantee it's not worth anything."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","955620","958060"," So spreads is where it's at."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","958060","960660"," I talked about a spread challenge earlier this week."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","960660","965140"," And then I'm going to attempt to turn $100 into $100,000"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","965140","968060"," and somewhere between 10 to 20 trades."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","968060","971060"," Now, when I first started to learn about spreads,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","971060","972220"," I watched all the videos."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","972220","974220"," I read the books, I read the news articles"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","974220","977460"," and when it came time to execute them,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","977460","979700"," I still felt a little lost"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","979700","982740"," and scared apprehensive to place them."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","982740","986500"," What I turned to was a website called"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","988300","990300"," options.ai."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","990300","993580"," Put place the referral link in the bottom of this video."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","993580","995820"," You can use that or you can just sign up on your own."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","995820","998020"," I have no affiliation with them."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","998020","1002420"," Also, you can execute these trades"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1002420","1004380"," on any platform that you like."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1004380","1007340"," But even if you don't want to execute your trades"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1007340","1011380"," with options.ai, they visually represent"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1011380","1015460"," structuring these trades fast and very well."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1015460","1018660"," So I do still recommend that you sign up for options.ai"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1020740","1023820"," to start learning how to place some spreads with me."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1023820","1026260"," Now, I'm not going to go into the details right now"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1026260","1028820"," of my rules for trading spreads,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1028820","1031060"," my rules for trading and all that stuff"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1031060","1033380"," until later videos."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1033380","1035740"," But there's going to be some homework to do from now"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1035740","1038060"," until we get started with this project."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1038060","1043140"," So step one's going to be sign up for options.ai."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1043140","1044420"," Link down below."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1045700","1050700"," I also put a link to right over here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1050900","1054380"," This is the optionseducation.org website."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1054380","1056100"," We'll have to link for this website as well"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1056100","1059060"," if you want to learn on a deeper level"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1059060","1061100"," how these plays work."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1061100","1064060"," And then I also left a link to Project Finance."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1064060","1065940"," I don't know this guy at all,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1065940","1067620"," but he does a pretty good job"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1067620","1071420"," of topically covering how spreads work."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1072380","1074780"," Now, the other homework this week,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1074780","1079540"," I want you to start becoming familiar with the SPY ES."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1079540","1084540"," I want you to become familiar with IWM and the NASDAQ."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1084980","1088660"," You could, I would prefer that you get involved in NDX"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1088700","1092700"," or NQ, and then I want you to pick one stock"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1092700","1094660"," that you're going to play regularly."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1094660","1097500"," I play Tesla, you can follow along with Tesla,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1097500","1100540"," you can pick Apple, Amazon, one stock"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1100540","1102580"," that you can become intimate with."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1102580","1106180"," I want you to know all three indexes or major indexes."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1106180","1108940"," I want you to have one favorite stock."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1108940","1111300"," And then the last thing that you're going to do"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1111300","1113820"," is you're going to create a watch list."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1113820","1118300"," I think I'm going to pay for a pro accounts"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1118300","1123220"," on trading view and send you guys,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1123220","1127220"," like let's say 100 stocks with, as a watch list"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1127220","1131780"," with some alerts on them so that we can enter trades"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1131780","1136340"," over time and maybe make 100K before the holidays."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1136340","1139860"," You'll have a nice gift to give to your loved ones"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1139860","1141500"," and family members."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1141500","1144240"," Now, let's review this one more time."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1145200","1148320"," You're going to sign up for options.ai,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1148320","1150680"," even if you execute the trades somewhere else."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1151720","1155160"," I'm going to send 100 bucks to this account,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1155160","1156800"," a wire today."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1156800","1159880"," If you wire it, it's faster than ACH."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1159880","1162560"," They do try, I think these guys charge a 2025 bucks"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1162560","1165240"," and your bank charges do 25 bucks."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1165240","1168280"," I usually just call the broker or email the broker"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1168280","1170000"," and I email them or call my bank"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1170000","1171920"," and ask them to remove that charge."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1171920","1175400"," They almost always remove those charges"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1175400","1180160"," when you're trading stocks or options or whatever you do."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1180160","1183600"," If you didn't know that, it's a nice little sum to know."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1183600","1185440"," And that's in the account section."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1185440","1187760"," I think that I signed up for this account"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1187760","1191680"," and 24 hours later, I was approved."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1191680","1193880"," And so today I'll add the money here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1193880","1196760"," So sign up for options.ai."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1196760","1199640"," We're going to start this next week at some point,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1199640","1202040"," probably Monday, Wednesday, or Friday,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1202040","1205080"," as long as you guys are all set up and ready to rock and roll."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1205080","1208520"," The other homework is going to be to set yourself up"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1208520","1211280"," with a free trading view account."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1211280","1214480"," I want you to start setting some support"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1214480","1219480"," and some major support and resistance lines on ES,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1219840","1223080"," on the RUP, which is IWM,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1223080","1227200"," and on NDX or NQ, which is the NASDAQ."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1227200","1228800"," Pick yourself one stock, right?"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1228800","1230880"," We talked about that one stock."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1230880","1233560"," And then you're going to have to go off on your own"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1233560","1238520"," to at least get a basic understanding of spreads,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1238520","1243320"," butterflies, iron condors, debit call spreads"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1243320","1245560"," and credit call spreads, debit,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1245560","1247720"," put spreads and debit call spreads."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1247720","1250240"," You don't need to know all the inside mechanics."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1250240","1252080"," I'm going to give you a rough overview"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1252080","1255800"," as the weeks progress, how these things work."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1255800","1258200"," And then I did leave, as I said earlier,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1258200","1261800"," I did leave these two resources"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1261800","1265040"," for you to do your own due diligence on spreads."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1266680","1268720"," Now, just getting back to options AI."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1268720","1270960"," Once you sign up for this and you're approved,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1270960","1273040"," you're going to be able to come through here"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1273040","1274160"," and start checking it out."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1274160","1277760"," You can type in spy, let's say,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1277760","1280160"," and then you can pick the time"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1280160","1282080"," that you want to put on your spread."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1282080","1286760"," We can pick one week or wait for the calculated move,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1286760","1288120"," expected move."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1288120","1290760"," We'll click one week, we'll trade the spy"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1290760","1293600"," and then you can choose bullish, neutral or bearish."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1293600","1296600"," And whichever one you choose is going to give you"

"RrdYZWvzPpU","1300280","1303240"," condors, butterflies, et cetera."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1303240","1306720"," And you can adjust these within, let's say you were neutral"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1307760","1310720"," and you picked the 18th for the spy."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1310720","1312280"," These neutral spreads would have worked out"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1312280","1314000"," for the past month on spy."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1315000","1319080"," Especially, I think butterflies would have worked out killer."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1321080","1325280"," Let's see, they're going to bring up some choices here."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1325280","1327640"," Actually, the condor would have worked out much better."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1327640","1329080"," So let's just choose the condor"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1329080","1331720"," and it's going to calculate the expected moves"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1331720","1333320"," and it's going to show you your profit area"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1333320","1336160"," within this play."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1336160","1338400"," And you can even come up inside here"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1338400","1343400"," and edit the width of your condor."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1344440","1346560"," And you do the same thing with debit and call spreads."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1346560","1348560"," We're going to go into this in-depth"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1348560","1352920"," as we start to play some trades next weeks at some point"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1352920","1357240"," and you can sign up for this website"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1357240","1360680"," and go through it and just see what the inner workings are."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1360680","1362360"," There aren't too many videos on YouTube"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1362360","1365840"," on how to execute trades on options that AI,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1365840","1367880"," I'm not sure why people don't use it."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1367880","1369800"," I even use it just to set up trades"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1369800","1371080"," if I execute them elsewhere."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1371160","1375160"," I try, sometimes I make these trades on Tasty"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1375160","1376960"," and I used to make some on Robinhood"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1376960","1379160"," even though I had this account to plot"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1379160","1382760"," and plan my money-making adventures."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1382760","1386160"," And we'll go into more detail, as I said earlier."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1386160","1387520"," Some of the risks that are involved,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1387520","1392040"," getting assignments, trading on cash,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1392040","1396880"," on AETFs that close and cash dividends"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1396880","1397800"," and all that kind of stuff,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1397800","1400200"," some of those big risks that are involved."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1400280","1403880"," Otherwise, I want you all to know that I appreciate"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1403880","1406480"," your interaction here on YouTube."

"RrdYZWvzPpU","1411320","1413120"," as much the past couple of weeks."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1413120","1415400"," The market has just been so slow"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1415400","1417240"," that I'm really only playing the opens,"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1417240","1420480"," the closes, any of these watch list alarms that I get."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1421680","1423240"," So hopefully this is going to change"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1423240","1425240"," in the next coming weeks."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1425240","1428400"," And hopefully the spy doesn't go down too much"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1428400","1431720"," so that we can start a spread on the spy"
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1431720","1434080"," at looking for the next move up."
"RrdYZWvzPpU","1434080","1436080"," All right, talk to you all soon, later."
