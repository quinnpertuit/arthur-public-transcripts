"220","640"," Let's start at the beginning."
"5020","5940"," Want to hear anything?"
"8800","14440"," This leader is provided to permit the projectionist to complete adjustment of focus and sound level"
"14440","16040"," before the film begins."
"19040","21020"," I don't know if everything is on. "
"24800","27840"," This leader is provided to permit the projectionist."
"32530","33130"," No."
"34230","35330"," No, I'm sorry. "
"51930","52750"," Come on, baby."
"55770","56170"," Seriously."
"69170","70170"," Check 1-2. "
"74070","75150"," Oh, we'll be there everywhere."
"75690","76290"," Oh, yes."
"86030","87250"," Dude, I kid you not. "
"87510","88230"," I am..."
"89550","91170"," Yeah, did I live in a third world country?"
"91470","92030"," I shit you not."
"92330","94530"," I don't know what the fuck is going on with..."
"95290","96110"," Michigan here."
"100420","101700"," They just said the F word. "
"101840","103340"," They're going to demonetize me."
"105020","109760"," They're like, you can't say the F word in the first five minutes or something like that."
"111800","112240"," Sweet. "
"112460","113100"," Hold on a second here."
"114160","116380"," I got some stuff I got to do."
"125600","128139"," My power has been out for..."
"130380","131920"," Oh, not since I got home. "
"132060","132940"," I got home and then it went out."
"136880","138440"," One quick second here."
"143360","145720"," Couple of seconds I got a couple of things I got to do in the background. "
"148320","150160"," And so my power has been out."
"150660","152300"," So I have what's called DTE."
"154060","160540"," If you go to, there's a DTE outage map for Detroit, Michigan, there's been power out all over the"
"160540","160740"," city. "
"160740","163380"," Not a ton, but enough, right?"
"163540","166740"," The barrel down 78 cents or zero spot 99%."
"169620","171740"," And I don't know if it's a..."
"171740","173740"," Anyways, one second."
"173940","174240"," Give me a second. "
"176880","177440"," Members."
"178880","179440"," Save."
"184500","185820"," Just a second here. "
"190160","190720"," Copy."
"191240","191320"," Close."
"198370","206590"," And I actually, it's summertime, so my house cannot take the heat either. "
"206810","211310"," So I have a generator, but it is not large enough."
"212310","213590"," It's a 5,000 watt generator."
"214430","215050"," It's loud too. "
"215230","219590"," I've got an inverter, a small inverter, but I wound up having to go out and buy a 9,500"
"219590","223870"," I think generator for my house."
"224650","233250"," To handle just basic stuff like the air con, the power being on, and then of course refrigeration"
"233250","234090"," and all that kind of stuff."
"234770","235430"," I've got a deep freezer. "
"236890","241130"," And, but it being summertime, my jetty."
"241410","244170"," So my jetty that I normally have is..."
"244170","252190"," I don't usually run everything off of it, but running my summertime, like 100 degrees here."
"254530","255990"," Let's go put that up right there. "
"263280","265980"," So I wound up getting a, I think it was a predator."
"268700","271580"," 9500 or something like that generator from Harbor Freight."
"271720","273140"," And it was reasonably priced. "
"273760","274360"," It wasn't too bad."
"274460","275280"," It was 2,500 bucks."
"276220","278020"," You know, 26 or something like that. "
"280760","282640"," Why no Tesla power wall?"
"283280","285320"," That's the function of DTE as well."
"285780","286620"," They are one of the worst."
"286920","292340"," They say that they're, they say that as a company, they say they're pro solar, but they're not. "
"293760","295300"," Like they are, but they're not."
"297620","299220"," I have thought about the power wall."
"299580","300640"," I haven't thought about the power wall. "
"301260","305480"," I thought about putting just solar on the house with a battery bank."
"308580","310460"," I live in a third world country called Michigan."
"315190","317230"," No, I'm not running a generator right now. "
"317490","320330"," I could not run my setup with a generator."
"322110","325570"," Even with the 9500 watts, I was afraid to run everything."
"326390","328450"," So I have to keep gassing it up, all that kind of stuff. "
"328630","330350"," Cost me like a fucking $500 in gas."
"330570","330870"," I'm stupid."
"331310","333430"," And I've got a bunch of tight tanks of gas outside now. "
"334110","339830"," I'm now the proud owner of, oh, I don't know, probably 10 gas tanks or something like that."
"342410","344170"," So let's take a look at the market though."
"344270","346290"," It's important that we look at the market together here. "
"346670","348710"," And there's a reason I want to look at the market with you guys."
"351030","353350"," So on Friday, it was Friday, right?"
"353910","355410"," We got a spike."
"358070","360830"," We got a squeeze to close the gap above. "
"361550","364030"," We're going to talk about, it's important that I get this out to incase it."
"364630","365590"," And now I might lose power."
"365730","366450"," I have to say this again. "
"366610","367750"," I might lose power again."
"368150","371010"," I'm not sure that has happened to me before."
"372930","376270"," So I want to be clear with you that it might not be over. "
"376530","383240"," So now we want to talk about Friday here."
"385200","388460"," So this is a, we saw this take place on Friday, right?"
"388660","389540"," Follow my cursor right here."
"390220","393780"," I think I posted on Twitter that we should gap up here. "
"395220","397400"," To return to the scene of the crime, right?"
"397580","398140"," And that's what we did."
"399020","400240"," So we came back up here."
"400540","402740"," We failed to close the entire gap. "
"403380","404320"," Closed most of it."
"405240","407680"," Squeeze higher and then rolled right back down again."
"408780","411120"," We're kind of in that situation right now. "
"412480","416940"," So I think some of you out there probably think we're done with this down move."
"416940","421500"," Or maybe you thought on Friday, I was wondering if people thought if we were down or done with the"
"421500","424540"," down move on Friday, if this was the bottom."
"424740","427480"," It shouldn't be the bottom at this point. "
"427940","431800"," I want to be clear with you on that that we have not changed direction yet."
"432400","434040"," And I'm going to show you that right now."
"436140","439180"," Now I am impressed with small caps. "
"439360","444020"," We're going to talk about them in just a moment, but I do want you to see that."
"445660","448640"," We're still at least according to zigzag channels."
"448640","450580"," We're still in a down move here, right?"
"451120","452720"," Came down touch the bottom here. "
"454040","455300"," Shot back up here."
"455500","457820"," You saw the squeeze on Friday."
"458360","459400"," They get posted on Twitter. "
"459920","460460"," We're going to squeeze."
"460800","463220"," We're going to return to the scene of the crime or at least close the gap."
"463740","464860"," That's what we did, right?"
"465140","465680"," Squeeze up here. "
"465780","466340"," Close the gap."
"467200","468920"," Back under right now."
"469420","472440"," Now, velocity is saying we're going to go higher again. "
"474940","477680"," We have the potential to go higher right where we are."
"479340","481340"," Let's take a look at velocity real quick, Vellow."
"481680","485280"," Now, there's some concern here, at least from my side. "
"485660","490340"," And you can see here, this is the daily is coming down."
"490660","493400"," Daily velocity is still stepping lower."
"494320","495340"," I want you to see that here. "
"496160","497600"," This daily Vellow is coming down."
"499260","501400"," It's important to pay attention to daily Vellow."
"503640","506500"," In the fact that it's stair casing down. "
"507500","510380"," It shows that the downtrend is still happening."
"510820","515539"," We're still coming down, even if we have an hourly bullish session."
"516740","518080"," There's a chance here. "
"519140","520380"," This is the 19th."
"520659","522820"," I think I had said the 15th to 19th."
"523360","525020"," Expect for us to have a down move. "
"525420","526520"," Even though we're heading down."
"527600","528700"," I want you to see this real quick."
"529740","533140"," See how we're in a downward channel here, right?"
"533460","536200"," This bottom has not been confirmed yet. "
"537520","541540"," Some of you out there probably think this is a double bottom and that we're going to the moon and"
"541540","542420"," correction over."
"544060","545480"," We can't call that yet."
"545620","547480"," We're still in a downward pattern. "
"548760","553600"," So before you can call that and say, yeah, correction over, there are some things that need to"
"553600","553900"," happen."
"554080","555980"," And I want to talk to you about what happened on Friday as well."
"557700","560060"," This is in our white paper, believe it or not. "
"560240","566120"," When you get a move above the daily Vellow or the hourly Vellow, do you see this move right here?"
"567240","568120"," And it's explosive."
"569320","570840"," There's two things you want to know."
"573040","575260"," One, we almost always come back. "
"576280","582800"," Like high probability that if you have that explosive of a move in one day, you're going to come"
"582800","584200"," back down at minimum."
"584960","588360"," You're coming back to check the hourly velocity again."
"588780","589260"," That's minimum. "
"590880","593540"," Likely that that squeeze is all that it is."
"593700","594340"," It's just a squeeze."
"595300","602120"," You really want to see some time spent on the hourly velocity, which is happening right now. "
"603000","605820"," You get a little bit of time down here spent on hourly Vellow."
"606420","611200"," But even if you get over it, you are looking for a kiss trade."
"611200","613180"," It's called a kiss trade, K-I-S-S. "
"615200","617160"," And you want to see it hold."
"618060","619960"," You can see that it did not hold here."
"620820","623120"," So it showed you that we are not bullish. "
"624140","631260"," So even if we were to squeeze here today, it's likely going to come back and check the hourly"
"631260","631860"," Vellow."
"632760","639160"," And it would need to hold hourly Vellow to say yes."
"639160","642220"," In fact, the correction is done. "
"644840","646480"," So you would see a trade like that."
"646620","647680"," I guess you'd see this here."
"648600","649040"," Go up. "
"649900","650180"," Right."
"650540","650860"," Return red."
"652060","652920"," Come back down. "
"656190","659410"," And we would hold the hourly Vellow."
"661850","667530"," And frankly, this squeeze shouldn't be this large."
"667910","670070"," It should just be like you're just coming up a little bit. "
"670070","671050"," Come back down."
"671350","674770"," And then you'd get your explosive move to the upside."
"675750","685230"," So the characteristics of this trade here in Friday was more squeezed trade, close the gap back"
"685230","687870"," here, and then continue on to the downside. "
"689430","691810"," Where we are right now is bullish."
"692570","695390"," If you look at where we are, what's kind of bullish?"
"696010","699710"," Hourly Vellow right now is, let's go to the one minute really quick."
"706550","707830"," Hourly Vellow right now. "
"707930","708510"," What's not bullish?"
"708770","710110"," I don't want to call it bullish."
"710450","710890"," It is bullish."
"711770","716350"," $4.39.19. Prices above the one in five minute. "
"716590","717930"," This is a bullish structure."
"718650","722770"," It's becoming a three trigger bull cluster right now."
"723110","727850"," Only if we break above $4.39.19. And what is happening right now?"
"727930","728730"," We're breaking above it. "
"728850","729310"," You see it?"
"730410","732990"," Getting squeezy right now as you're here."
"733330","738730"," So if you're watching right now, there is another squeeze trade coming up right as we speak right"
"738730","739030"," now."
"741030","742510"," So I want to show this to you. "
"742570","752330"," This is $4.39.19. So you probably don't see this on your stuff"
"752330","753270"," at home, do you?"
"753710","755210"," But it's right there."
"755210","757770"," There is a box right here."
"759490","761170"," Hourly velocity is right here. "
"761450","762090"," And you can see."
"762830","765010"," So I'm going to post this on Fintuit right now."
"765890","769050"," I can't believe this is happening right as I speak. "
"771230","771790"," Spy."
"772250","772330"," Ready?"
"774490","780050"," Three trigger bull cluster again."
"797820","799680"," Get ready to get your face ripped off. "
"805600","807920"," I'm thinking about my verbiage here, making sure."
"809720","810160"," Spy."
"810680","812520"," Three trigger bull cluster again. "
"812760","814120"," Get ready to get your face."
"815020","815920"," Oh, no, I didn't say ripped."
"816420","816600"," Damn it. "
"830650","831090"," Okay."
"831350","835230"," So right where we are right now."
"837110","838950"," Where are we likely going?"
"839410","841210"," So we're going to look at a couple places, right?"
"841330","842390"," We got this tag right here. "
"843390","844610"," This is the first one."
"845650","847930"," The second one is actually higher."
"848130","849930"," It's right here. "
"851610","853890"," And the next one is right there."
"854610","857530"," And we still have some gap left behind above."
"857810","864210"," We've got a gap above us at $4.42.64. We have another gap above us. "
"864330","867590"," We still have a close at $4.42.79 right up in here."
"868410","870650"," Now, do you take calls here?"
"871590","872110"," No."
"873470","874250"," You don't. "
"874950","882150"," Now that we're coming into a close right now where sellers want to pin this close, what you want to"
"882150","884270"," see is if you can get it this exact right now."
"887870","890990"," $4.39.20. Yeah, you do."
"890990","892210"," I'm going to buy some calls with you. "
"892290","892610"," Hold on here."
"898360","899000"," Right there."
"899140","899800"," That's the early trigger. "
"902380","902940"," Hold on."
"903040","904020"," I'm going to jump on board with you."
"904120","904820"," Give me a second here. "
"906100","906500"," HT."
"926270","927070"," All right."
"927710","937670"," So I'm on right now for $0.49. $4.39. Three trigger pull cluster"
"937670","939270"," right now on the spy. "
"940270","941630"," And I'm on 710."
"941850","942970"," So for today, we'll see what happens."
"950190","956430"," So saying that right now, where we are, I'm still bearish here where I'm still in this whole mode"
"956430","963890"," of correction, not as over as you think it is, even though we are bullish today. "
"964710","966590"," And I am still long puts."
"967670","970850"," Protect protective puts for the month into middle of the month right now."
"971250","972110"," Never cut them loose. "
"972450","977890"," Have not sold them still on them for about monthly puts, not in a month or anything like that."
"997300","1002680"," Price target 441.37. Right here."
"1017950","1018930"," 10 seconds. "
"1024190","1025869"," We'll see if we have an edge again today."
"1027310","1028130"," And that's or not."
"1032550","1039829"," 7 spot to 4 billion, 7 spot to 4 billion low in the forecast of 20 billion US consumer credit"
"1039829","1041790"," 7 spot to 4 billion. "
"1066390","1068410"," So I'll show you what I'm watching here in the background."
"1081070","1084110"," This dream is sponsored by this price above the green."
"1084530","1090230"," We've got the white and red line coming up by signing up to the tick dot com. "
"1090230","1092790"," My stops will be right down here."
"1107660","1109280"," We'll see how this plays out."
"1118360","1121460"," And then we'll talk about downside targets, that kind of stuff in the marketplace. "
"1181330","1183650"," Yeah, we're on a three trigger bull cluster right now."
"1188480","1190140"," Well, there's two ways to look at this."
"1190320","1197000"," You could say, well, you can't say, well, you can say if there's a rejection here in the hourly"
"1197000","1197360"," trigger. "
"1197360","1206760"," Now that we're going to roll over, but right now we have a series of higher lows on velocity."
"1207400","1208580"," So let's look at velocity really quick."
"1209300","1210060"," So I can show you this. "
"1210660","1213660"," So velocity right now is saying the move is up."
"1214440","1216720"," I want you to look at this really quick with me."
"1217000","1218740"," So I'm looking at what you're saying here. "
"1218940","1225420"," And I want you to see here is you have a secret trick."
"1225920","1227760"," We've got two things going on here."
"1228720","1230280"," You've got a secret trick. "
"1230440","1231620"," You've got an edge in the marketplace."
"1231940","1233300"," The first one, it's right here."
"1233700","1238320"," A series of higher lows on Velo wanting to break higher. "
"1239660","1243600"," When you see this right here, this is an edge telling you that we're going higher, at least right"
"1243600","1243860"," now."
"1244340","1248160"," We have another problem though, and that is time is passing."
"1249540","1254300"," As time passes, you can see, I don't know if you can see this stuff. "
"1254480","1263220"," You have two big things happening here."
"1263400","1265260"," One, you have time passing, which is never good."
"1266260","1274200"," The longer time passes and sellers can't get the price of spy down, daily velocity continues coming"
"1274200","1275100"," higher here, right?"
"1275920","1278000"," And weekly velocity goes higher as well. "
"1278000","1281060"," I gave you a target below of 420, right?"
"1281280","1282440"," We had 432 and 420."
"1283480","1287460"," Here's 432 on daily velos."
"1287600","1289240"," Now it's almost at 434. "
"1289960","1291000"," So you can kiss that goodbye."
"1291820","1298140"," Now that 432 target, first target, and 420 as your next target for next week, right?"
"1298500","1300980"," So 432 not yet done."
"1301420","1306320"," And then of course the 420 should be up here by the 15th on weekly. "
"1307620","1310940"," We should get a tag of this weekly velo."
"1311160","1312660"," We haven't touched it in many months."
"1313540","1317700"," As months go by, there should be a tag of this at some point. "
"1318760","1324680"," Now the one thing on the bull's side that they have going for them is velocity to the upside."
"1326320","1330820"," And you can see it on the hourly here, price stays above, we should squeeze higher."
"1333280","1334420"," Let's see it right here. "
"1335080","1336520"," I am long here, by the way."
"1337240","1345800"," Even if we go higher though, I'm still going to expect a roll, squeeze higher."
"1346220","1349560"," Let me roll down to this daily, just like this. "
"1350360","1355200"," We'll get our new low, maybe tomorrow, next day, 434 now, not 432."
"1356300","1357860"," And hopefully we can tag that 420."
"1357860","1362400"," If you're a bull, you want to see us tag that weekly. "
"1364180","1368760"," Every three months or so, four months, you want to tag that weekly in a bull market."
"1370260","1372320"," That's the norm in a bull market."
"1375320","1378640"," Now my calls are now 43 cents, 44 cents. "
"1379920","1382080"," Still long calls on spy."
"1383360","1388300"," If they were at power hour right now, if they don't run this up into this bell here, I'm going"
"1388300","1391360"," to have to close at some point and I'll pick up more calls for tomorrow."
"1396340","1401140"," Yeah, there's some more SPXs under it's hourly value though. "
"1401620","1404180"," So SPX is telling you know we're not going to go up that high."
"1406480","1408240"," SPX telling you we're getting a roll here."
"1408400","1409640"," Let me bring up SPX really quick. "
"1413960","1418040"," SPX bombing right now, but still you can see the hourly value to the downside."
"1418480","1421100"," So this one is making me wary of my calls."
"1421100","1422480"," I should have looked at this one here. "
"1422640","1423320"," Didn't see this."
"1423800","1427660"," So even if we do squeeze here, 441, 380, maybe."
"1429460","1433780"," And then once the overnight takes over, this will help me make my decision. "
"1434080","1436180"," Yeah, we're still bullish on ES right now."
"1436700","1438960"," So ES is saying the move is to the upside."
"1440820","1442460"," It's a little bit of conflict here. "
"1443980","1447140"," During cash market hours, I trust SPX the most."
"1448800","1451720"," And then once we get into the overnight hours, I trust ES to the upside."
"1457320","1458840"," We're going to talk about small caps. "
"1459940","1461340"," At some point as well."
"1465640","1467880"," SPX saying that this was bottom over here."
"1469020","1471000"," Although it is bearish on velo. "
"1478010","1480730"," You can see I'm trying to sell it right now off the hourly trigger."
"1481630","1485410"," Now my calls are $0.28. I'm taking a bath right now."
"1485610","1486750"," I'm down 40% on them. "
"1488570","1497060"," I added another $0.25 at $0.29 just then."
"1497760","1520330"," Now up to $0.50. Contracts $0.49 and $0.29. No"
"1520330","1521710"," interest in CPI Wednesday."
"1521950","1522630"," No, I've got none. "
"1523230","1524150"," I get to see too."
"1524410","1526710"," I've got no interest in my interest."
"1526950","1527890"," I'll be honest with you guys. "
"1528090","1530950"," My interest in most news events is waning."
"1532410","1534430"," Mostly just trading the trigger right now."
"1534710","1540410"," I'm not trading anything else a lot because it's proving itself regardless of what the news is. "
"1542530","1544190"," I've got interest in CPI."
"1544190","1547550"," I've got interest in earning season."
"1551700","1554920"," Maybe like how those are interpreted wherever we are in the marketplace. "
"1555560","1560880"," But generally speaking right now, most of my interest lies in the trigger telling me where we're"
"1560880","1561120"," going."
"1564120","1565240"," Good question though."
"1567400","1569840"," We're above right now on ES. "
"1571040","1572840"," We are on ES right now."
"1572940","1577020"," We're bullish for the overnight."
"1579080","1581400"," We're bullish for a squeeze higher in the overnight right here. "
"1581520","1583860"," We'll see if they do it right now or if they do it overnight."
"1593860","1595560"," We're bullish on ES for the overnight."
"1596280","1606180"," As long as we stay above 4, 4, 3, 5.25. We're bullish in the overnight right now on ES. "
"1606840","1609920"," SPX is telling the only SPX saying they were bearish still."
"1610640","1612340"," We're going to look at IWM as well."
"1613500","1615500"," Before I get off the air here. "
"1618160","1619600"," IWM is cranking man."
"1620340","1622140"," I'm super, super bullish on it."
"1622640","1624100"," And it's been doing a great job here. "
"1624240","1627540"," It's actually at the top right now of its resistance."
"1628460","1629480"," But it's above its hourly."
"1629480","1632000"," It didn't roll over like Spi did. "
"1633160","1635840"," And I'm very bullish on IWM right now."
"1637240","1641480"," And of course it's telling a different story than Spi right now, SPX."
"1646280","1648040"," So we'll get that before the end of the day today. "
"1648380","1649160"," Matter of fact, we'll get it right now."
"1662610","1664110"," IWM, fascinating, right?"
"1668260","1674140"," On Friday when IWM rolled over or squeezed, right?"
"1674140","1677560"," Saved its daily, stayed above, well, eventually stayed above its monthly."
"1678120","1682840"," But when it rolled over here, it did not break below its hourly trigger. "
"1683160","1685860"," It squeezed again above its hourly trigger."
"1686660","1692920"," Now you should see another roll down here in IWM to 186.42. But it's underneath its hourly right"
"1692920","1693160"," now."
"1693480","1694820"," Its daily is getting more bullish. "
"1695960","1700540"," I'm looking for another bounce trade on IWM here to the upside."
"1701940","1705720"," And it take out that 189.50 above."
"1710130","1711930"," I'm actually very, very bullish. "
"1712410","1716110"," They caught the monthly, they caught the monthly close."
"1716990","1718750"," It's now turning up right here."
"1719490","1723970"," But they caught the monthly close for a bullish look on it. "
"1724810","1734550"," So I'm fascinated to see if IWM can break above its previous high here at 189.05. I'd like to"
"1734550","1739330"," take this trade here at 186.52 in the next day or two."
"1744310","1746310"," I'm going to try to stop me out down here."
"1746450","1748050"," You can already see they're trying to right now. "
"1765220","1771020"," So overall on spy, still looking for the tag of the weekly down below at 420."
"1771020","1775740"," I said 432 and then 420."
"1776740","1781120"," But 434 is now apparent on the daily because you've traded sideways for so long. "
"1781940","1785200"," So if they adjust the 432 call to 434."
"1786120","1789620"," And then 420 ultimately would like to see spy tag that."
"1795980","1797680"," I've got puts for that four. "
"1797800","1801120"," I've got puts for 432 and then for 420."
"1835010","1836290"," I'm hoping for it."
"1836370","1836930"," Well, not hoping. "
"1837390","1843430"," The longer we trade sideways, the more those are going to come up."
"1843770","1847470"," Your daily triggers and weekly triggers are going to continue higher."
"1848390","1850250"," And we likely will explode higher. "
"1850650","1855470"," So if we trade sideways like this for the next two, three weeks, it's not going to matter."
"1855610","1860850"," If we get to the 15th, 19th, 20th with no significant down move, we're just going to start ripping"
"1860850","1861670"," higher at some point."
"1874870","1876370"," Now trading 31 cents. "
"1881970","1888270"," I'm on 50 contracts on 439 C for the close."
"1894980","1896940"," Yeah, I've got a zero dates for today."
"1896940","1899640"," I've got a June 10th, zero date calls. "
"1900300","1903020"," And then I'm sitting on monthly puts on spy."
"1915970","1917530"," Rotation or consolidation."
"1918050","1920550"," This is all rotation, still super bullish here. "
"1922230","1926350"," So my long term view here is that spy is going to all time highs."
"1928230","1931410"," Likely not just all time highs, likely even higher."
"1932330","1935310"," So my ultimate view is that we're going to. "
"1935990","1937710"," Let me explain this better."
"1937890","1939310"," I was supposed to make a video about this."
"1940110","1941530"," Let me show you guys something here. "
"1950110","1954570"," So let's take a look at what I'm trying to explain to you guys out there the other day."
"1959710","1961910"," So you've had a very good run here."
"1962150","1964650"," Now this is a very good bull run. "
"1964650","1969190"," We hit the daily up daily, operate one, two, three, four, five."
"1970030","1971330"," Close to the daily, right?"
"1971650","1972210"," Close to the daily."
"1972970","1975010"," We have not checked the weekly. "
"1976290","1977570"," I'm going to start getting rid of this."
"1983770","1985450"," So we have not touched this weekly."
"1986410","1988210"," And we have not touched the daily, right?"
"1989190","1991390"," We're in a downtrend right now overall. "
"1992470","2000170"," But when we're in a bull run, you tend to touch that weekly in a bull run three to four"
"2000170","2002570"," times a year somewhere in there."
"2003870","2005570"," So I want you to see the last one."
"2005690","2006850"," So this is 2021. "
"2013960","2016000"," And I want you to see this run here."
"2017000","2018640"," So this is very similar, right?"
"2018840","2020360"," You have a break above."
"2022180","2026280"," You have price get above the hourly, the daily, the weekly and the monthly. "
"2026580","2027120"," This is bullish."
"2030000","2034300"," Now we usually come back and check the daily, right?"
"2034520","2035040"," Get a nice high."
"2035220","2039660"," Come back down and at least check this weekly at some point and continue higher. "
"2039700","2040200"," Do you see that?"
"2040520","2042220"," This is almost every bull run."
"2044340","2048120"," And so the key point here is what are we looking for?"
"2048219","2049840"," Minimum of touching the daily."
"2050239","2052400"," And if anything, maybe possibly break under it. "
"2052840","2059580"," One of the cool parts though of these runs is you don't, you don't, you don't see these lines"
"2059580","2061380"," breaking below."
"2061659","2063480"," So you're not seeing the yellow line."
"2066260","2070659"," To this yellow line, you're not seeing it cross the weekly, right?"
"2070980","2072460"," You're not seeing it turn over and roll down. "
"2072860","2076340"," You're seeing price go down there, but not the daily trigger go down there."
"2077060","2080440"," It's confirming that even though we're bouncing, that we're still bullish."
"2082239","2084480"," We're still bullish, right?"
"2084480","2085920"," The trigger is not crossing. "
"2086320","2090179"," You still see the separation and triggers."
"2091420","2096020"," You actually get bearish when you see, and you see how it didn't cross down here?"
"2096700","2098480"," See how it crossed though right here?"
"2099500","2102140"," This is bearish to the yellow line crossing the orange."
"2102420","2103600"," That's your first signal right there. "
"2104020","2107000"," Well, it's not your first, but there's a velocity signal in the background."
"2109040","2110940"," But you at least come back and check these things."
"2110940","2115020"," Every bull run in history, we come back and check the daily. "
"2115900","2119220"," And about three to four times a year, the weekly right here."
"2119300","2119660"," There's the weekly."
"2122220","2124080"," Yellow line still looks bullish here. "
"2124340","2125620"," Orange line coming up to meet."
"2126220","2126920"," Very bullish, right?"
"2127960","2136060"," So we're at least looking for a test of this yellow line and possibly potentially a test lower at"
"2136060","2136520"," some point."
"2138780","2141980"," All right, there's the 29th, there's the 30th right in there. "
"2143300","2149380"," Even if we squeeze higher, an eventual at least touch there to go higher or a break underneath to"
"2149380","2150500"," touch and go higher here."
"2151140","2154540"," But none of these lines are showing bear, like ultimate bearishness."
"2154680","2159740"," We're not seeing like, hey, yeah, we're, you know, like the yellow line's careening downward or"
"2159740","2160780"," anything like that. "
"2160920","2163020"," We're seeing though here, this is the 30 minute chart."
"2163020","2163500"," See this?"
"2164080","2167420"," You see how the daily is rolling here to the downside?"
"2168880","2171540"," So I'm ultimately going to expect us to come down here."
"2172180","2175920"," Go to zero line and then start to trade higher again. "
"2176140","2179920"," Whenever that may be, I think it's the next two weeks, three weeks."
"2185660","2187620"," We're still in a descending channel here."
"2189220","2201800"," We have"
"2201800","2203500"," a little bit of rolling going on right now. "
"2203500","2205780"," I might have to stop myself up before the end of the day."
"2205960","2207920"," So I'm still long calls for the close here."
"2208380","2211000"," I'm trading 25 cents right now on those calls. "
"2224150","2225050"," Hey, thanks, Joe."
"2227670","2230390"," So the question becomes, is this rotation or consolidation?"
"2231410","2232310"," It's a mix of both."
"2233370","2235010"," It's rotation and consolidation. "
"2243340","2244240"," Come on, baby."
"2245140","2246540"," Print my shit into this close."
"2246540","2248560"," Do me a creepy crawler up the side here. "
"2249280","2251700"," So I want to see is like, whoop, right up there."
"2281760","2283460"," 439 is all over the place."
"2283660","2285120"," They're now 30 cents right now. "
"2298590","2299870"," Price target to the upside."
"2300630","2302830"," 441, 47, I believe."
"2306300","2307880"," I know that sounds crazy, doesn't it?"
"2308980","2312480"," Watch this close like fucking flat sideways into the bell. "
"2312480","2320390"," So if there's a one minute chart."
"2323490","2327150"," Neto Stoltenberg says other one agreed to forward Sweden's bid."
"2372230","2374170"," No, I'm I read I read both. "
"2374550","2378850"," So when I'm reading chats, right, I've got I've got some walking is going on here."
"2379530","2385670"," So I've got so I want you guys to know I've got a chat open with YouTube and Twitch."
"2386730","2389470"," So I've got a I've got a rolling chat, right?"
"2390710","2391530"," Right here. "
"2391550","2392270"," I've got a screener."
"2393110","2395610"," And it shows me both YouTube and Twitch."
"2396850","2402150"," And then but sometimes it lags or I need to reset it. "
"2402810","2407990"," That's from a thing called stream labs."
"2408810","2412830"," So I run a multi stream across different platforms."
"2413490","2415010"," And that's where I get that chat from. "
"2415870","2420690"," As a matter of fact, I have supposed to start another platform this week at some point, supposed to"
"2420690","2422290"," be streaming to some other platform."
"2423850","2425890"," But I've got to so I've got to chat."
"2426170","2430670"," They wrote that runs that shows both YouTube and Twitch, but it's not just real time. "
"2431090","2432070"," They can fall behind."
"2432670","2434990"," If I refresh it, the entire chat disappears."
"2436250","2442030"," So it's kind of like a it's kind of like a mixed bag of do I refresh the chat, making"
"2442030","2443150"," sure it's real time or not. "
"2443870","2449830"," But I won't be able to scroll back through and see the old multi chat or multi stream chat."
"2450150","2455890"," And then I've got a I keep open real time chat on YouTube and Twitch."
"2457510","2462370"," So I've got three chats open trying to try to keep up with you guys. "
"2464090","2464970"," Seller rage."
"2466590","2470730"," Sellers do not want to see this squeeze higher into this close right now."
"2470770","2471890"," I'm kind of pissed off of myself. "
"2472170","2473570"," I'm trapped right now and calls."
"2476730","2478010"," Now I want to buy some yes."
"2478350","2480830"," I'm like, Oh, I want to buy some yes for the after hours. "
"2490960","2495060"," Now, but my real time chat is only on YouTube and Twitch."
"2495960","2497620"," So I bounce between all three."
"2497920","2501900"," So it's kind of hard at times to keep up with the chats. "
"2503220","2506000"," You see, ST and there's STT Voyager just said."
"2506560","2507340"," So here's an example."
"2508700","2509540"," This is all good. "
"2509660","2510060"," This is all Twitch."
"2510360","2511580"," Yeah, this is all real time right now."
"2511580","2512180"," I'm good right now. "
"2518390","2521630"," Do I prefer subs on Twitch or YouTube?"
"2521810","2522470"," I like them both."
"2523110","2526210"," I like I like subs on both Twitch."
"2526930","2529990"," I can't believe how great Twitch has been. "
"2532310","2532640"," Twitch."
"2533590","2534450"," So Twitch."
"2534970","2536270"," So there's a couple things here. "
"2536390","2542390"," So like YouTube is YouTube is built for recorded videos."
"2544430","2548070"," A specific link recorded and shorts."
"2548570","2549330"," That's what they're built for. "
"2549510","2551150"," YouTube hates live streaming."
"2552130","2553650"," They are they suck at it."
"2553650","2554530"," I don't know if they suck at it. "
"2554630","2556070"," If the algorithms or they don't like it."
"2556810","2558710"," They're not built around live streaming."
"2558990","2563990"," So Twitch though is built around around live streaming. "
"2564490","2573090"," It's built for live streamers and they really do a great job of highlighting live streamers."
"2573310","2573950"," That's their focus."
"2574470","2578390"," So Winky was trying to explain it to me. "
"2578590","2578950"," He's like."
"2579790","2582490"," He's like in terms of being a live streamer."
"2583270","2585510"," He's like you're like a rock star on Twitch. "
"2586190","2587170"," And I'm like, no, no, no."
"2587170","2589050"," I've only got 400 or 200 or 300."
"2589870","2595090"," Now I'm getting thousands of people watching on Twitch, which is fascinating. "
"2595590","2595770"," But hit."
"2596090","2597670"," I didn't believe what Winky was saying."
"2597670","2601810"," Winky's point was if you have 100 people watching you on Twitch. "
"2603430","2606510"," That's like 5,000 on YouTube."
"2607550","2611410"," 200 people is like 10,000 on YouTube."
"2612470","2617070"," It's so when you start to see 400 500 1000 2000. "
"2617550","2623250"," Sometimes I get two, three, four times like up in the last week, I had like, I think it was"
"2623250","2627690"," 3600 viewers at one point or 4,000 viewers on Twitch."
"2628070","2631170"," That's like having like 100,000 people watching you on YouTube."
"2632010","2633210"," People are like, no, no, it's not. "
"2633370","2635570"," It's, it's, they're the same."
"2635770","2636550"," And I'm like, no, it's not."
"2636850","2638390"," I'm like, it's not the same. "
"2638610","2639890"," I thought it was the same too."
"2640670","2649550"," If you look at the, if you look at the, if you look at the statistics of streamers"
"2649550","2654690"," on Twitch versus people making videos on YouTube."
"2656130","2657910"," It's, it's, it's apples and oranges. "
"2658290","2661270"," It's like comparing, it's trying to compare two things that are completely different."
"2664010","2666470"," And I didn't, I couldn't grasp it."
"2667170","2672810"," And then he had sent me some links to some stuff to look at on Twitch statistics. "
"2672950","2674590"," And it's like mind boggling."
"2676730","2681490"," I was a, I was in affiliate with, and I think, I think a three days on Twitch."
"2682150","2687210"," And then I was offered partner and I couldn't become an affiliate for like two weeks, even though I"
"2687210","2688070"," met all the requirements. "
"2688410","2692050"," And then I think in two weeks, I was eligible to be a partner with Twitch."
"2693030","2694010"," So it's, it's great."
"2694470","2700870"," A matter of fact, I'm going to heading out to TwitchCon in October to try to meet people. "
"2702090","2707850"," So Twitch has been great in terms of traction."
"2708330","2709410"," YouTube doesn't provide that."
"2709510","2710750"," YouTube's like, nah, nah, nah, nah. "
"2711370","2714990"," They're like, make a video every night for 44, for 20 minutes or 45 minutes."
"2715090","2716910"," And we'll get you 100,000 followers over there."
"2718550","2721870"," But they, that YouTube can't stand streamers. "
"2722690","2723450"," I don't know why that is."
"2729790","2734210"," So right now, right now we're, we're bearish or well, that bearish, but we are below the one in the"
"2734210","2736630"," five prices on the one minute right now."
"2736670","2738170"," It's not looking good for me. "
"2738690","2741390"," But I don't, I'm not, I'm not trusting this close here."
"2741510","2745430"," I'd like to see the squeeze higher and then a sell off of that."
"2748030","2748730"," So we'll see. "
"2749570","2752530"," I'm calling, I'm calling a, I'm calling bullshit right now."
"2754350","2760090"," Either right now or after hours on the price of spa here, even though I'm bearish."
"2761430","2763990"," I think we're going to squeeze and then sell it down even lower. "
"2766090","2767370"," Same, same thing on Friday."
"2769490","2770910"," Same as Friday, no difference."
"2771990","2772850"," I think that was Friday, right?"
"2773170","2774930"," Yeah, I think Friday was the same thing. "
"2775710","2778830"," So squeeze higher, then you, then they roll it back down even lower."
"2779790","2783530"," And currently for tomorrow, the target for tomorrow is."
"2785150","2787850"," 434, 43, but not until we squeeze. "
"2788450","2790890"," So we squeeze higher, then we roll it down to 4."
"2795550","2796510"," 434, 3438."
"2798590","2800930"," So squeeze the close, sell it down tomorrow."
"2811230","2813390"," Yeah, you got to stick to YouTube and I get that too. "
"2813390","2815050"," This is another aspect of this."
"2815190","2817610"," There's a reason why I, I streamed to both."
"2818530","2822190"," Why do I stream to both is for multi reasons. "
"2822550","2826670"," Like number one, some people can only watch on YouTube as Andrew is saying."
"2827350","2829090"," Some people are used to YouTube."
"2829330","2830650"," They're like, I'm familiar with YouTube. "
"2830830","2831490"," That's all I do."
"2831690","2832650"," I don't do Twitch."
"2833270","2834150"," So I get that. "
"2834490","2835270"," I'm fine with that."
"2835390","2835930"," I understand it."
"2836910","2839470"," I understand people don't want to learn something new. "
"2840310","2842430"," So I do stream to both."
"2842430","2848570"," But then I've got people that only like Twitch for a multitude of reasons."
"2848630","2853570"," Twitch is almost real time without having to catch up ever. "
"2854590","2856270"," There's a native delay in YouTube."
"2857470","2859650"," Younger people watch Twitch."
"2860090","2861130"," They don't watch YouTube as much. "
"2861530","2861930"," They watch Twitch."
"2862210","2862810"," They watch TikTok."
"2863690","2865850"," They watch shit like that, right?"
"2867330","2868570"," So I want to keep that. "
"2868770","2872090"," If that audience prefers Twitch, then I'm going to stream to them."
"2882170","2883850"," I'm trading 24 cents right now."
"2915670","2916270"," And then. "
"2918210","2919010"," Looking for."
"2921890","2923490"," We're waiting for the crash in spring."
"2925970","2927310"," Yeah, I think we squeeze. "
"2927710","2931170"," So my take here is that we're going to squeeze this close and then you're going to we're going to"
"2931170","2931870"," get a roll afterwards."
"2933670","2937970"," I think that we're not done with this gap up here."
"2939530","2940510"," Put it right here. "
"2942490","2944370"," So there's still this gap right here."
"2944690","2946090"," Follow my cursor up here."
"2946930","2951230"," Whether we do this into this bell or if we do this in the overnight and then we roll it"
"2951230","2951770"," back down. "
"2952690","2953630"," Something like that."
"2954030","2954690"," So that's what I'm seeing."
"2955530","2956970"," Still not done with this above. "
"2958130","2959690"," Until we begin to head lower."
"2960950","2965430"," Our next target lowers now for 3466."
"2966310","2970630"," And then for still have 420 as the what I'd like to see is the low. "
"2975960","2979040"," So it just depends upon your time your timeline here."
"2982120","2984600"," Other killing me right now with these fucking calls."
"2985700","2986200"," I'm pissy. "
"2987620","2989340"," 332 in the afternoon."
"2993520","2995380"," Just pure garbage right now."
"2996780","3000500"," The other the other place I was going to start to stream was a kick. "
"3001380","3003740"," So the next the next platform."
"3003980","3005640"," We all should start streaming on here shortly."
"3005880","3007740"," Our coming up is to is kick. "
"3009240","3013320"," So if you guys are if any of you are on kick you'll expect me there here shortly."
"3024920","3027060"," Yeah, there's definitely some seller rage here."
"3028860","3030680"," They do not want to see the squeeze. "
"3038490","3041530"," Sellers like no more squeezing just straight down which I prefer."
"3041890","3043030"," I hope that we go down."
"3043730","3047790"," The sooner we hit 420 the easier the market can go higher. "
"3064400","3069740"," And 433.98. Better better target for tomorrow."
"3070040","3072580"," 434.65 would be the target for tomorrow."
"3076630","3077770"," Got a stick to YouTube. "
"3079170","3079930"," Let's see that's you Andrea."
"3080730","3081470"," See what Twitch is saying."
"3093640","3094620"," Call is not the play. "
"3095380","3101640"," Yeah, they're just zero dates."
"3110760","3115180"," Yeah, I'm calling this bullshit here."
"3115260","3116940"," I'm still I still don't believe this bullshit. "
"3117220","3118460"," I'm trying not to believe it."
"3119740","3122440"," If we start to break under it though, I'm going to believe it."
"3122680","3124640"," We're getting a bear flag here. "
"3125440","3127260"," Free sugar bear cross right now."
"3128920","3131920"," I can see it right here forming, so I'm going to get stopped out here."
"3131920","3134780"," I can already see it close to getting stopped out. "
"3136800","3138100"," It's right there."
"3151320","3152540"," That should be the red line."
"3162770","3163710"," Right there. "
"3167660","3169060"," Still long calls here."
"3181600","3183040"," Trade 21 cents."
"3192660","3198160"," Heads of Bostick, even with a 25 BP move at next meeting will still require patients from there,"
"3198180","3201280"," not expecting dramatic sea changes in inflation. "
"3202300","3206300"," Rate moves have been knife edge calls July to be the same."
"3206320","3207460"," That's Bostick saying that."
"3208160","3212400"," We could easily we could see inflation getting 2% without more rate hikes. "
"3213440","3216480"," And allowing inflation data is telling a very positive story."
"3216480","3218760"," Yeah, we have to go over that this week."
"3220560","3223100"," The moment that inflation stops going down. "
"3223340","3227660"," Oh, by the way, guess what I bought about eggs for a dollar."
"3229680","3232420"," At Aldi of all places."
"3233780","3244000"," About eggs for a dollar and butter for $3.20. I was impressed to impress to see that, but"
"3244000","3245300"," this here's a fascinating thing. "
"3245300","3251700"," So I bought eggs in the butter for I bought butter for $3.20 and eggs for a dollar about"
"3251700","3252180"," three dozen."
"3254480","3256880"," I was like, we'll find something to do with them."
"3258940","3262800"," Well, trade 27 cents right now in 439 C's. "
"3265980","3266500"," Whoa."
"3266500","3269240"," 26 cents."
"3270520","3271040"," Whoa. "
"3271940","3273140"," Oh, baby."
"3276980","3282360"," So these I swear to God these fucking like this market right now, right is so fucked up."
"3284640","3287640"," Trade 29 cents right now in 439 C."
"3289100","3290200"," Come on, baby. "
"3291320","3293220"," Rip their faces off into the bell."
"3293600","3294280"," Please do it."
"3295240","3296880"," I want to prove them all wrong. "
"3301020","3302440"," Come on, baby."
"3303560","3304680"," 338 right now."
"3305440","3308600"," Well, you know, this shit always turns into like a memorable video, right?"
"3308960","3310620"," It could be like, it could be an hour long video. "
"3310640","3311100"," It won't matter."
"3313260","3314680"," 28 cents right now."
"3317140","3318100"," Not so bad, right?"
"3318200","3321720"," I'm only down really like, well, right around here, I'm only down like 13 cents or something like"
"3321720","3323240"," that. "
"3325280","3327080"," I'll fucking laugh my ass off."
"3327280","3328220"," Rip based into this clothes."
"3329360","3329620"," I will. "
"3331840","3334200"," But so I bought a I bought a bunch of shit."
"3334340","3334820"," That was cheap."
"3335400","3338020"," I went out shopping and I'm like, oh, well, so we've been on vacation. "
"3339320","3340780"," And a couple things here."
"3340840","3342080"," So my wife and my kids, right?"
"3342460","3343340"," So power went out."
"3343740","3344980"," Wife and kids were like, fuck this. "
"3345080","3345460"," We're out of here."
"3345600","3346320"," Let's go to the lake house."
"3346420","3349600"," I'm like, I can't leave after gas the fucking we got food and refrigerated. "
"3349600","3350820"," I got a freezer full of shit downstairs."
"3351880","3352860"," I'm like, I can't leave."
"3352880","3355020"," I have to keep gasing up the the Jenny, right?"
"3355540","3357120"," I don't know fucking pissed about this. "
"3357600","3359240"," I'm pretty fucking angry, right?"
"3359240","3360180"," I can't run anything."
"3361000","3362880"," So the wife and kids are like, we're leaving."
"3363300","3364580"," And I'm like, okay, well, you leave. "
"3364980","3366360"," I'm going to get a new fucking generator."
"3366580","3367240"," I'm so pissed off."
"3368280","3371660"," But even then, like, I don't I think I like a gas tank. "
"3372940","3374700"," That's like 200 gallons or something."
"3375400","3379500"," And even then, I have to change the oil."
"3379900","3380760"," You can't leave. "
"3382800","3386440"," Like, even with a generator, like you have to change the gas."
"3386660","3388480"," You have to do all this other fucking stupid shit."
"3391520","3393020"," Come on, Spy, dude. "
"3393220","3393340"," Seriously."
"3393800","3394380"," You're killing me."
"3395520","3396540"," Killing me, Smalls. "
"3398660","3399880"," Just squeeze the clothes."
"3404900","3405740"," Just go up there."
"3405900","3408360"," Do you just want to see, like, the fucking face ripper into the bell?"
"3409460","3410400"," Way up there. "
"3418460","3420420"," So I see prices coming down."
"3420780","3421600"," What is that about inflation?"
"3421960","3423100"," There's a couple of things we have to talk about inflation."
"3424080","3425800"," So I'm like, okay, prices are coming down. "
"3426280","3429060"," But then I go, like, so we're up, we've been on vacation, right?"
"3429260","3434060"," So then I go to, like, um, I go on vacation and I'm trying to buy firewood."
"3434740","3437120"," And I'm out like this little store for firewood."
"3437420","3438940"," One in corporate profit margins. "
"3438940","3440040"," It benefits no one."
"3440200","3446080"," If it feeds inflation to borrowing to fund public sector pay rises is inflationary."
"3446760","3449780"," And UK finance minister Hunt says Bank of England's Governor Bailey. "
"3450440","3453760"," And I will do what's necessary for as long as necessary to return."
"3453760","3455060"," CPI to 2%."
"3455860","3457040"," So I go to the store. "
"3457160","3458580"," I'm trying to buy firewood and ice."
"3459340","3460600"," And it was expensive."
"3461340","3464500"," It was like, here's a three pound bag of ice for five bucks or something. "
"3465020","3467400"," And I'm like, dude, my local grocery store."
"3467500","3469980"," It's like three bucks for a 20 pound bag of ice right now."
"3470100","3470760"," Everything's going down. "
"3471120","3475360"," Early marks on closing balance, currently sitting at 571 million to the south side."
"3475840","3478940"," But these fucking small stores, they're like, fuck, no, we ain't never come back."
"3479160","3479720"," We're never going back. "
"3480140","3480640"," Eggs are $20."
"3481160","3482440"," They were actually 20, but they're like."
"3482440","3484740"," They're like, fuck, no, we like it. "
"3484860","3485380"," We have inflation."
"3485640","3486460"," I'm like, no, we don't."
"3486700","3487540"," It's coming down, dude. "
"3487820","3488480"," I'm like, all these big."
"3488640","3490280"," Oh, dude, what the fuck are they doing?"
"3494690","3495030"," Masters."
"3496730","3497950"," Eighteen cents right now. "
"3499650","3501610"," All right, so I'm going to give this five more minutes."
"3503750","3504690"," Five more minutes."
"3504970","3505610"," Three forty one. "
"3506590","3507590"," Hopefully I can grab."
"3507830","3510450"," I can at least sell out of these calls and lick my wounds."
"3512130","3515330"," But it's fascinating because as the week, I go through this weekend, right?"
"3515470","3520470"," Vacation and I see inflation coming down in companies, large companies. "
"3521470","3526870"," Are adjusting to it is my point, but not everybody is adjusting to it."
"3526930","3531170"," Some people have been like, like you see the greed from corporations with inflation."
"3531170","3533350"," You know that most inflation has been a scam, right?"
"3534030","3538570"," But you see like a lot of small small businesses are like, we kind of like this for making all"
"3538570","3539070"," this money. "
"3541150","3543650"," And I don't think they want the gig to be up."
"3544010","3547390"," So every so you've got like a two set two faced problem here, right?"
"3547510","3548470"," You've got a small business."
"3548650","3551590"," It's like God damn inflation is out of out of control. "
"3552030","3555470"," And then of course it's coming down and they're like, well, wait a minute."
"3555550","3561170"," We think it's out of control that we do like charging triple what we should be charging."
"3562050","3569490"," So I found it fascinating just the fact that prices are coming down and small businesses do not"
"3569490","3570170"," want those prices. "
"3570170","3570850"," To come down."
"3570990","3574950"," They like the prices higher and they're going to try to keep them high as long as they possibly"
"3574950","3575370"," can."
"3582570","3583770"," That's killing me here, man. "
"3584030","3584950"," Let's make my eyes bleed."
"3586470","3589170"," In the next five minutes, I need this price to go up just a little bit more so I can"
"3589170","3589810"," at least get out."
"3591390","3592150"," Like my wounds. "
"3592590","3596070"," Watch me, watch me, watch me cut my calls and we rip face in the last five minutes."
"3599330","3600930"," Trading 22 cents right now."
"3601170","3604790"," I bought 25 at 49 and 25 at 29. "
"3605450","3606790"," So I'm getting eaten alive here."
"3611700","3613080"," So I was just fascinated by it."
"3613120","3614040"," But we've talked about more about inflation. "
"3614540","3616020"," Maybe we can, I can probably stay here."
"3616860","3620040"," You guys want to go over the market really quick with me after the close we can."
"3620880","3622300"," If you guys want me to stay, I will. "
"3622580","3624480"," And we'll look at the entire market as a whole."
"3624660","3626460"," We can go through all the indexes."
"3627040","3628780"," We can go through HYG. "
"3629000","3629720"," We can go through VIX."
"3629800","3632200"," We can go through Bitcoin if you want."
"3632280","3633620"," We can go through Fangnan plus T."
"3634400","3636480"," If you want me to stay after the bell I can. "
"3639020","3639560"," Yeah, okay."
"3639660","3639800"," I'll stay."
"3640440","3643680"," Yeah, I'll go through my go through spy SPX and all that stuff. "
"3643800","3645840"," I'm just, I want to stick around after for today."
"3647360","3649680"," And we'll go over the entire market and a market overview."
"3651200","3653420"," What we should be looking at though too is how about this?"
"3653520","3654520"," We'll look at the market overview. "
"3654520","3657620"," We'll look at market breadth."
"3657860","3661180"," We'll look at some other fascinating things that say we're going down."
"3662080","3667080"," And we're going to look at one cool thing that we'll look at is. "
"3669540","3674500"," All of the dynamics of the Fed funds rate."
"3675480","3675960"," Inflation."
"3675960","3677060"," We can look at that stuff. "
"3679760","3681640"," There's a part of inflation where."
"3683560","3684980"," Once once the."
"3685660","3686940"," It's hard to explain. "
"3687960","3690040"," As inflation is coming down, right?"
"3690180","3692620"," So inflation is like as it's ripping down."
"3693380","3695600"," The market should trade sideways and up."
"3698100","3701660"," Once the rate of inflation going down stops. "
"3701760","3703540"," It's usually bad for the market."
"3704880","3707880"," So once we once we attained that 2%."
"3708760","3710780"," It's never good for the market. "
"3710780","3713280"," It sounds counterintuitive, doesn't it?"
"3714600","3718740"," And that is when the 10s and 2s, 2s and 10s matter, believe it or not."
"3719280","3721660"," The yield curve does will matter at that point."
"3721880","3722860"," You should also see. "
"3724280","3728600"," A pause in rates, if not a loosening of rates."
"3731360","3735000"," And someone actually turned my attention to, I don't know his name."
"3735880","3737980"," I don't know this guy. "
"3738300","3739880"," Some guy named Gammon or something."
"3739880","3741320"," I had a video sent to me."
"3742640","3744520"," From about him and I watched it. "
"3744780","3746660"," Some guy, I don't know his name is something Gammon."
"3747360","3752200"," And I watched his video and he had it right about banks that we have."
"3752340","3754620"," We have liquidity being pumped into the system. "
"3755780","3757540"," Through the banks right now."
"3758320","3761440"," So we do he backed up my previous statement of."
"3761960","3763040"," I'd made two statements. "
"3763340","3767020"," One, they're performing QE through the banks, even though you don't see it."
"3768740","3770820"," And he discusses that in a video."
"3770820","3774840"," I don't know if you guys watch that guy or not, but he did watch his video and he was"
"3774840","3775080"," correct. "
"3776200","3777160"," He was very correct."
"3777380","3780520"," We are running QE through other avenues right now."
"3781980","3787440"," Now, there is an issue if the banks will loan that money to us, even if they don't. "
"3787660","3789720"," Look at these big green bar right there."
"3789900","3797080"," There is a question of, will they lend the money to you?"
"3797880","3804800"," There's another question here where they still loan it to his point was they're loaning it to hedge"
"3804800","3807120"," funds to buy the market right now."
"3807140","3810960"," So they're giving loans to hedge funds to actually buy this market right now. "
"3811020","3816160"," They're not loaning it to you, but they are loaning it to to other entities out there."
"3818300","3822560"," And so, yeah, they're performing QE, whether you believe it, like it or don't like it."
"3825100","3826700"," Yeah, George Gammon, that's the guy. "
"3827180","3829640"," George Gammon watched his video on that over the weekend."
"3833750","3835030"," I don't know anything about the guy."
"3835270","3836210"," I don't know who he is. "
"3837110","3838310"," I've never watched him before."
"3838850","3842370"," I think his face looks familiar to me, but I don't know who he is."
"3843410","3844770"," Yeah, I'm trying to close out. "
"3845430","3846950"," I'm at 15 cents right now."
"3847010","3847850"," I'm kind of pissy about it."
"3850030","3851030"," I'm trying to close it. "
"3851110","3851790"," I have not closed yet."
"3851790","3852350"," Still long."
"3855190","3856590"," Yeah, we're not set up for a crash. "
"3856930","3857970"," Well, we'll talk about that too."
"3858190","3859170"," I'll show it to you guys today."
"3859330","3860130"," We'll look at it after the close. "
"3860730","3862270"," We are in no way set up for a crash."
"3862490","3864690"," And anyone's claiming a crash is out of their fucking mind."
"3865430","3867050"," Like literally out of their fucking mind. "
"3871500","3873380"," We are in no way set up for a crash."
"3875080","3876260"," They're out of their fucking minds."
"3876480","3881880"," Well, they're either trying to sell, they're either trying to get followers, sell subscriptions, or"
"3881880","3888200"," they're going to wrap it up and claim that they closed their shorts when we tagged the weekly and"
"3888200","3889720"," that they're once again long or something. "
"3891180","3892000"," That's what they're going to claim."
"3892480","3895860"," So we're not in any way shape or form set up for a crash."
"3897420","3898800"," If we are though, we'll know it. "
"3899780","3903100"," We can show that if we are going to crash, what it looks like."
"3904100","3906140"," We can talk about that if you want to if you have time."
"3913280","3914120"," It's really bizarre. "
"3914460","3919740"," Like when you call a crash, right, you can call it if you kind of know it's coming."
"3922560","3929900"," But you can't call it until you have proof of it happening."
"3931600","3932900"," It's really bizarre thing. "
"3933560","3934840"," We'll talk about it today."
"3935840","3937140"," We'll talk about a crash today."
"3937620","3941760"," Matter of fact, in the background, I'm going to open up some stuff here for you guys to look at. "
"3945280","3946880"," We can show you guys what to look for."
"3950560","3955920"," Give me a second here and I'll wait a minute here."
"3962100","3963580"," They're putting the pain on me, dude. "
"3963980","3964840"," Serious pain on me."
"3983750","3984630"," Yeah, we're going to look at that."
"3989280","3990860"," We're going to look at all the macro you need. "
"3991380","3992440"," We're going to look at the daily chart."
"3994120","3995180"," What else we're going to look at?"
"4001080","4002840"," P ratio cycles."
"4003540","4004060"," Something that one. "
"4008180","4011760"," I don't know if we're not going to talk about earning season just yet."
"4012440","4013120"," Stock picks."
"4013500","4013540"," Nope. "
"4015160","4016420"," I think I got them all up."
"4016420","4017300"," What we're going to look at."
"4019720","4021800"," Do they are straight revenge trading this one?"
"4022960","4024840"," The calls are now eight cents here. "
"4025920","4027380"," Nine, so I'm sweating, dude."
"4027900","4029040"," I'm sweating fucking bullets here."
"4029820","4030760"," I'm pretty fucking pissed. "
"4032000","4036140"," Marked on closing balance, currently sitting at one spot seven billion to the south side for the"
"4036140","4037620"," final orders to come through before we call it."
"4041390","4044730"," Marked on closing balance, one spot seven billion to the south side."
"4044730","4046750"," That's the mark on closing balance for today's session. "
"4047070","4048190"," One spot seven billion."
"4048190","4049530"," Trading 12 cents right now."
"4056680","4058100"," I got to get ready to close these. "
"4058280","4059400"," I'm going to get fucking smoked here."
"4064220","4065660"," 13 cents right now."
"4067640","4068720"," 15 cents. "
"4088210","4089290"," 17 cents."
"4119420","4121580"," I'm looking at calls for tomorrow to here."
"4130960","4132040"," 14 cents. "
"4138569","4139290"," 16 cents."
"4139810","4140310"," Dude, seriously."
"4140750","4141630"," What the fuck are you doing?"
"4143210","4145910"," They're like a bazillion calls or something on 439s. "
"4145970","4147830"," They don't want to see them close in the fucking money or something."
"4148550","4149569"," 17, 16."
"4152229","4154170"," I'm going to stick around with you after the bell here. "
"4154229","4154870"," We're going to go over the market."
"4155890","4159029"," We're going to look at why these people are out of their fucking minds thinking that we're"
"4159029","4159290"," crashing."
"4161510","4161810"," 14. "
"4162510","4163109"," Dude, seriously."
"4166649","4169050"," We're going to go over today why these people are out of their minds saying that we're going to"
"4169050","4170370"," have a crash or a set up for a crash."
"4171270","4174210"," I'm going to say I haven't looked in a week or two. "
"4174609","4176689"," So I haven't seen what would say that we're going to crash."
"4178790","4179590"," We look right now."
"4186960","4188420"," Yeah, no, they're out of their fucking minds. "
"4192729","4194330"," They're going to get fucking smoked."
"4195670","4199890"," I'm telling you what, if anyone that's saying we're going to crash, is going to get their fucking"
"4199890","4201010"," asses ripped out."
"4203810","4205330"," 18 cents right now. "
"4205550","4206730"," Come on, baby."
"4207370","4209230"," 23 cents right now."
"4209610","4210290"," Dude, come on. "
"4210430","4211610"," Just fucking running up."
"4212590","4213910"," The fuck are you doing?"
"4214050","4214750"," 19 cents."
"4214970","4215670"," 20 cents. "
"4217830","4218770"," 20 cents."
"4218910","4220190"," 21 cents right now."
"4220590","4221510"," 22 cents. "
"4229590","4230750"," Oh, God."
"4239300","4241000"," 19 cents right now."
"4243700","4245060"," All right. "
"4245640","4246960"," All right, hold on."
"4261600","4262540"," All right."
"4263080","4264060"," I've got us. "
"4264320","4264660"," I've got us."
"4264820","4266280"," I've got to stop limit here, so."
"4268240","4269600"," 25 cents. "
"4269600","4270580"," Come on."
"4271100","4272580"," Get the fuck up there."
"4273420","4274560"," 26 cents. "
"4282710","4284250"," These motherfuckers, dude."
"4284890","4285830"," I shit you not."
"4290090","4291950"," Yeah, fuck your puts, by the way. "
"4293690","4295590"," 28 cents right now."

"4305070","4305750"," 25 cents."
"4305910","4306230"," Come on."
"4307850","4309290"," Don't fucking do me dirty. "
"4310070","4310830"," 26 cents."
"4310990","4312050"," 27 cents."
"4313570","4315250"," Squeeze out every one of these assholes. "
"4316890","4318050"," Squeeze them all out, dude."
"4318370","4318750"," Just do it."
"4320630","4321410"," Do it. "
"4321690","4323170"," Give me the fucking last five minutes."
"4324250","4325210"," Come on."
"4325890","4326970"," 28 cents. "
"4343640","4345900"," Oh, dude, I'm so mad."
"4347020","4348760"," So fucking mad right now."
"4358440","4360300"," Five minutes left into the bell. "
"4361260","4363520"," Back on the hourly trigger right now."
"4364320","4366020"," Trapping these fucking sellers."
"4368240","4369900"," I got to stop them below. "
"4370220","4371720"," So if I get triggered out, I get triggered out."
"4375980","4376800"," Come on."
"4379180","4382420"," Dude, give me that last five minute just creepy crawling up the fucking wall. "
"4383340","4384820"," Fuck every one of these last bears."
"4385080","4387480"," Dude, get up there and get that price target last five minutes."
"4388080","4388800"," Do it. "
"4389820","4391860"," I'm trying 29 cents right now."
"4393060","4394460"," 30 cents right now."
"4396820","4398380"," These fucking bears. "
"4399680","4401340"," Fucking lion fucking bears."
"4401740","4403280"," Every day lion bears."
"4403860","4404620"," 31 cents. "
"4404900","4405520"," 30 cents."
"4410680","4411760"," Fucking a man."
"4412180","4412960"," This is pissing 29. "
"4413180","4413620"," Come on, man."
"4413780","4415580"," Dude, just give me three green bars."
"4416200","4418320"," Give me four big green bars. "
"4418320","4422400"," Oh, you suck."
"4426320","4428840"," I'm going to take an L on this one way or another, aren't I?"
"4430540","4431420"," 25 cents."
"4431700","4432340"," Oh, there it goes. "
"4433280","4433880"," There it goes."
"4434000","4434820"," I'm going to get triggered right now."
"4436120","4436720"," Come out. "
"4438460","4439580"," They just stopped me out."
"4441160","4441600"," Motherfuckers."
"4444780","4446360"," I just got stopped out. "
"4447160","4449080"," That's a pretty, pretty big loss there."
"4449560","4450360"," Doesn't matter, though."
"4450520","4451740"," Anyways, there's your squeeze. "
"4452160","4452560"," It's happening."
"4453640","4457420"," I would not be caught short here, personally, until tomorrow."
"4458600","4461480"," And then we're going to talk about the rest of the week here. "
"4462300","4463140"," Fucking a man."
"4463300","4465040"," I could have closed the 29 cents."
"4466500","4468360"," The last nine fucking pennies, too. "
"4468940","4470000"," Okay, hold on a second here."
"4473240","4474440"," Just a second here."
"4489230","4490750"," Let's see what they do in the last couple minutes. "
"4490750","4491730"," The last three minutes here."
"4492430","4494230"," They stopped me out right in the spread bar right here."
"4498070","4499750"," Okay, we're going to have a chat here. "
"4499850","4501510"," We're going to have a fireside chat, okay?"
"4502850","4503870"," If you're a bear."
"4504730","4507150"," If you're a collapsed bear, we're going to have a fireside chat."
"4507330","4510570"," I need this message really isn't for bulls. "
"4512870","4515330"," This message is for you if you're a bear."
"4516190","4518090"," We have to have a fireside chat here."
"4518770","4519990"," It's important that we do. "
"4521910","4526250"," And the reason is, it's multi-fold."
"4528710","4532690"," Maybe we can, I'm just going to find a ticker that."
"4536370","4539850"," I want to see the ticker that's topped, maybe, or something like that. "
"4539850","4542710"," Let me look at Facebook or something."
"4546570","4551090"," Not right now, but I want to show you guys something here."
"4551570","4553130"," Look at fucking meta beast mode. "
"4557110","4558670"," What's important here?"
"4559470","4560890"," Let's look at meta."
"4566650","4568150"," This is meta."
"4571450","4573090"," There's something important here about this. "
"4573150","4574150"," This is a daily chart on meta."
"4575830","4577470"," Look at a weekly on meta too."
"4579730","4580990"," Kind of an important thing. "
"4584390","4586210"," This is a weekly chart for meta."
"4586550","4589170"," I'm using this as an example."
"4592150","4593790"," Let me delete all this crap in here. "
"4596390","4596990"," Delete all."
"4597210","4597910"," Yeah, delete all everything."
"4598290","4599350"," Okay, so meta. "
"4603800","4606080"," I want you to see some, I want you to look at meta."
"4606280","4607800"," This is a weekly chart on meta, okay?"
"4608700","4610880"," And what the importance of a weekly chart?"
"4611780","4616660"," This is a 30 EMA and 129 or 116."
"4617280","4618240"," It's between 27 and 30. "
"4619160","4620700"," 129, 116, 119."
"4621380","4622640"," This is a weekly chart on meta."
"4622820","4623540"," This is an important thing. "
"4624680","4629320"," So on a weekly, so weekly you see the closing bars underneath."
"4631020","4632380"," You see that right there?"
"4633320","4636940"," That's your first indication that meta is bearish."
"4638820","4646100"," And when you're drowning a stock, a stock ticker symbol, they'll fail to go higher. "
"4648100","4649000"," And you can see it."
"4649800","4657460"," You can actually see the, you can actually see how like, see how it rolls here."
"4658180","4659380"," And then it starts to go higher. "
"4659640","4660280"," That's bullish, right?"
"4661060","4663140"," You can see the failure here."
"4663900","4668680"," You can also see the flattening of that white line and the white line rolling over, right?"
"4669140","4670220"," This is all very bearish."
"4671720","4674920"," That's when you can become bearish on, on, on meta. "
"4677060","4681520"," On a daily chart on meta."
"4682820","4684220"," You can see it here."
"4685220","4686800"," You can see price break below. "
"4688040","4690240"," And you can also see, see the difference here?"
"4691340","4693620"," You see how it recovers and goes higher?"
"4694160","4695380"," So was there crash risk here?"
"4695660","4696100"," Yeah, there is."
"4697300","4698480"," There's crash risk."
"4698880","4699440"," Right fucking there. "
"4699560","4700760"," We're making my cursor is right there."
"4701380","4701900"," There's risk."
"4701900","4706920"," And I bet somebody said, meta is going to crash right here. "
"4708040","4708940"," It's going to crash."
"4709120","4709960"," They can't say that."
"4710540","4713780"," They can say, yeah, it's got risk of crashing here. "
"4715260","4716600"," And it didn't, right?"
"4716940","4718840"," So they can't say it's going to fucking crash."
"4720300","4722620"," Now, but there's some key points here."
"4723460","4726620"," You can see that it came back up higher, right?"
"4726900","4730740"," And you can see right here, crash risk ended, right?"
"4731480","4734140"," You can see here though, that you have one failure. "
"4734380","4736160"," We had a failure to close that gap."
"4737520","4740820"," We had a new low, another failure up here."
"4741660","4744060"," And right here is where it actually began to crash right there. "
"4744960","4748040"," But you could actually see it crashing with just that white line."
"4748300","4751660"," You can see the white line going lower and begin to break."
"4753240","4756880"," You didn't see any break of that white line below the red line, did you?"
"4757320","4759080"," You never saw a break of that white line. "
"4759080","4762040"," But you did see a break of the white line over here."
"4762200","4762580"," Do you see that?"
"4762740","4763880"," It's very clear as fucking day."
"4763960","4764800"," It's clear as fucking day. "
"4765660","4769620"," White line breaks over there and does not break over there."
"4770380","4773280"," So there's risk of crashing here."
"4774180","4775780"," But we're not crashing. "
"4776400","4778200"," You don't have the white line underneath."
"4778960","4780040"," It's that simple."
"4780560","4782140"," Alexa, hang on, hold on. "
"4782240","4783360"," I got everything that's resetting in my house."
"4784140","4785960"," So you have risk of crashing."
"4785960","4789080"," And you have, we're going to fucking crash this ticker. "
"4789780","4790960"," Does it make sense to you?"
"4791820","4797480"," So if you see that white line cross underneath the red line, not good, right?"
"4798160","4802180"," You don't see the cross of the white line previously here."
"4802740","4803880"," It's clear as fucking day."
"4805200","4806940"," Clear as fucking day. "
"4807540","4809600"," White line crossed underneath the red lines."
"4809840","4811380"," Pretty fucking simple."
"4813760","4815820"," Is the spy doing that right now?"
"4818040","4820300"," Is the spy doing any of this right now?"
"4821160","4821920"," You tell me. "
"4824140","4826680"," So you got people out there calling for a crash, right?"
"4827440","4829240"," Look at that SPX and see if it's doing that."
"4831340","4832960"," I don't fucking see that."
"4835300","4837200"," I don't fucking see it. "
"4839880","4842620"," So who the fuck out there is calling for a fucking crash?"
"4843080","4844700"," They're out of their fucking minds."
"4852250","4856230"," I don't see this red line here, flattening."
"4857390","4858950"," It's not even flattening. "
"4859090","4859530"," It's going up."
"4860570","4864950"," I don't see the white line coming down here to touch it."
"4865150","4866030"," It's not below it. "
"4868050","4871170"," So how the fuck are you calling a crash right now?"
"4871170","4873290"," Now I've got another way to look to see if we're going to crash."
"4873830","4877370"," I'll show you that in a moment before it happens, like up here where we are."
"4878310","4879710"," How the fuck are you going to call that?"
"4879850","4881150"," You're out of your fucking mind. "
"4882330","4886510"," You're out of your fucking mind if you're calling a crash right now."
"4886990","4889150"," Your smoking fucking crack is what you're doing."
"4890270","4891190"," You're shooting heroin. "
"4892130","4893810"," You're fucking, I don't know who's calling that shit."
"4894270","4899170"," But they're out of their fucking mind right now calling for a crash of the S&P 500."
"4899170","4901670"," Or NASDAQ or IWM. "
"4901990","4902590"," I don't give a fuck."
"4903050","4904410"," They're out of their fucking minds."
"4905650","4908410"," And that's a pretty easy way for you to look. "
"4908830","4914010"," It's a pretty simple way in real time if we have crash risk."
"4915430","4917450"," Do you know where we did have crash risk?"
"4918970","4919790"," Right here."
"4921630","4923190"," We had crash risk. "
"4924170","4924950"," That's different."
"4927070","4931660"," You want to see something else that's cool?"
"4931900","4932380"," Look at SPX."
"4932540","4933300"," This is SPX, right?"
"4934020","4935860"," Notice how the white line doesn't cross. "
"4936760","4938880"," Notice how the white line does cross."
"4939520","4940320"," What does that present?"
"4941940","4942920"," Crash risk."
"4943820","4944700"," Do you get it?"
"4945820","4952600"," So if you've spent your fucking time out there calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling"
"4952600","4956100"," for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash,"
"4956100","4957700"," calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a"
"4957700","4957760"," crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling"
"4957760","4957760"," for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash,"
"4957760","4957760"," calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a"
"4957760","4957760"," crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling"
"4957760","4963370"," for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash,"
"4963370","4963450"," calling for a"
"4963450","4974510"," crash,"
"4974510","4974510"," calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a"
"4974510","4993110"," crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash,"
"4993110","5003070"," calling for a"
"5003070","5005530"," crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling"
"5005530","5005530"," for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash,"
"5005530","5005530"," calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a crash, calling for a"
"5005530","5009010"," crash, calling for a crash, calling for a that's what they do they call it they call it they call"
"5009010","5015790"," it they call it and eventually they're fucking right now there is a way to see if we're gonna crash"
"5017450","5027250"," before i'll show you those right now now you have precursors to a crash one of your precursors is"
"5027250","5033190"," watching a weekly chart believe it or not you as long as price stays above the one the five the"
"5033190","5039290"," hour the daily in the weekly good to go and furthermore if those lines are heading straight up or"
"5039290","5043370"," sideways you're still good you're still along this market uh..."
"5043370","5047870"," and as a matter of fact even when you come down you don't see the lines turned down and cross"
"5048550","5056950"," you're just looking for a dip to buy do you see the healthiness of this pullback here do you see"
"5056950","5063750"," how price goes lower but the white line doesn't see how price goes down but the white line is not"
"5063750","5071510"," following see how the white line didn't come down here with price the big thing to see right see"
"5071510","5080470"," how the white line is not coming down with price do you see how the white line is coming down"
"5080470","5088670"," with price right it is crossing down here and let's say you wanted to sell the market crash you"
"5088670","5094890"," actually had an opportunity to do that up here you didn't need to call this you need to exit your"
"5094890","5103890"," lungs and you had an opportunity to sell the market down your positioning in this market should be"
"5103890","5112670"," a buyer of this market until the market says otherwise does that make sense to you so if you're a"
"5112670","5120590"," bear you should be a buyer of the market and then when the market shows you that it's going to"
"5120590","5127130"," begin to become risk off that's when you turn bearish now if you're a better on the sell side"
"5127130","5135010"," that's fine but if you're going to be on the sell side you have to rain it in until we"
"5135010","5143670"," become risk off you have to lower your expectations to the downside you have to be tactful you have"
"5143670","5149130"," to say well I've got a target of 432 I've got another target of 420 and I'm going to fucking"
"5149130","5157350"," sell my puts or close my shorts until the market says otherwise until the market shows that I don't"
"5157350","5162890"," that I no longer have to be tactful and I can go full fucking bore and sell this market you"
"5162890","5170790"," have to there is nobody with real money in this market nobody that makes money like real money"
"5170790","5176070"," right that is actually like that in this market if they are they're out of their fucking minds and"
"5176070","5180750"," they're lying they have to be they have to be working a job they're doing something I promise you"
"5182410","5190310"," so this is pretty easy with just two things what's really cool about this too is I want to show"
"5190310","5196850"," you something really neat so this is SPX let's look at it on a weekly there are some really cool"
"5196850","5202850"," things here in a weekly you could see a cross for a major down move right here you see it"
"5202850","5209710"," this actually implies a major crash on a weekly time frame see it?"
"5210510","5221370"," here's another one this is 2000 implying a major crash ahead major big second leg down see"
"5221370","5229030"," it on the weekly notice how we didn't get it here in the weekly did we notice how we didn't"
"5229030","5238750"," get it here did we notice how we didn't get it here so even when we crash how"
"5238750","5248930"," bad is it going to be I can infer how bad it's going to be I can infer I"
"5248930","5253370"," can infer that if I look at a weekly chart with a 27 or a 30 EMA and a 129"
"5253370","5263830"," or a 119, 116 whatever you want I can actually fucking infer how bad is it going to be and"
"5263830","5270190"," which crazy is there were times in the past where we resolved this there's actually a time in the"
"5270190","5279750"," 1980s where it was looking like we were going to have a major crash where it did"
"5279750","5289950"," break below show you one right here it's back in 1982 back"
"5289950","5298990"," in 1982 we made a cross in March 12th of 1982 and we you would say to yourself we are"
"5298990","5307350"," at risk of a major crash like major like the kind we had in 2000 and 2008 but guess what"
"5307350","5317010"," it did it resolved itself in October of 1982 so let's say we're in March and I say to you"
"5317010","5325550"," of 1982 I say we are in risk of a major crash it doesn't happen October comes and I say"
"5325550","5333970"," to you we have resolved that risk of crash you should long the market that's what you should have"
"5333970","5335010"," done do you see that?"
"5335230","5340930"," so we're at risk of major crash we've now resolved and we're going higher you can see it here and"
"5340930","5350030"," here see it right here March 5th resolves itself in October does that make sense?"
"5350390","5362390"," so you have risk of crash you have we are crashing and"
"5362390","5369950"," you have more important concepts and furthermore if price is above the white and red line we're"
"5369950","5375110"," bullish and we're buyers and we're looking for dips to buy and if the white line's not crossing the"
"5375110","5382590"," red line we're definitely tactful as sellers you can see right here where the white line crosses"
"5382590","5387370"," we're no longer tactful let's sell this shit to the depths of hell right?"
"5387930","5395150"," white line has crossed the red line price is below it let's sell this fucking pit make sense?"
"5398860","5400000"," make sense right?"
"5401160","5407640"," otherwise you're going to get your ass handed to you and you're going to get blown out so this is"
"5407640","5411740"," spx right now right?"
"5412000","5418880"," and you're looking for a roll you're looking to touch the white line in a bull run you're looking"
"5418880","5424720"," to touch the red line every three or four months well not the red line this is actually different"
"5424720","5431560"," lines we're trading the yellow line right now but you want to trade this at some point you want to"
"5431560","5436540"," trade 420 you want to touch grass you want to get out of the basement and touch grass every once"
"5436540","5442300"," in a while we do that in bull runs you can see it right here pull back right here corrected"
"5442300","5451520"," right here corrected right here corrected right here corrected right here corrected right here we"
"5451520","5458380"," don't have to we just run this all the way up we can get close to it but you're a"
"5458380","5463900"," buyer of this fucking market not a seller well I'm a seller right now but I'm a seller because I'm"
"5463900","5468120"," trying to get down to that white line on a daily I'm looking to pull back a little bit correct"
"5468120","5478350"," a little bit so we can continue higher now some other fascinating stuff I want to show you you"
"5478350","5479050"," ready for the juice?"
"5479730","5488240"," I just got a oh by the way the other"
"5488240","5493160"," thing I have going on you guys may or may not know this is I'm trying to switch my phone"
"5494140","5502160"," and I'm trying to switch my phone and I think I'm getting text messages like a day later or"
"5502160","5506780"," something I just got a text right now that said slayer calls I'm assuming that text was made"
"5506780","5513960"," earlier so another thing that I want to show you here is this this is very important here okay"
"5513960","5523840"," these are cycles of the stock market okay and when we become like majorly"
"5523840","5534520"," over bot we tend to roll in and I want you to look at this here okay the weekly to"
"5534520","5540360"," that weekly a little bit over bot here right starting to tell you the stock market kicked off the"
"5540360","5546320"," week I want you to see this right here this is a weekly here okay weekly velocity price is going"
"5546320","5551920"," higher the inflation data at the start of the earnings season following a three-day slide in the S "
"5551920","5560280","&P 500 the benchmark turn that down you can see that velocity is going down while price is going up"
"5560280","5567740"," okay I also want you to pay attention to monthly velocity we're peaking up here see how we're"
"5567740","5576540"," peaking see how we're coming down see how we're beginning to come down then it's warning you to the"
"5576540","5583780"," peak and then we're coming down right it's warning you that we have a crash ahead so before we even"
"5583780","5593260"," get there what am I looking for well I'm looking for weekly to peak and also monthly to peak"
"5593260","5595360"," have we peaked on monthly yet?"
"5595600","5606760"," fuck no we haven't so right now there's no pre-warning for me we're not already up here this"
"5606760","5613280"," hasn't peaked for a matter of time and this hasn't begun to roll over and this hasn't peaked here"
"5613280","5617700"," yet has it so I don't even have a pre-warning I don't even have a fucking pre-warning of"
"5617700","5623560"," a pre-warning that we're at risk of crash right now there is no pre-warning of a market crash"
"5623560","5635920"," right now this market is being accumulated that's what's happening that is what's happening so"
"5635920","5643220"," we're cycling up believe it or not we're cycling up we're not cycling down if you're a seller you"
"5643220","5650580"," have to be tactful right now so velocity is telling me get fucked that's how velocity is telling me"
"5656730","5663750"," velocity is telling me in no way shape or form are we selling this market it's not happening yet"
"5664630","5674300"," monthly is telling me that as well so hold on a second here go back to one minute"
"5676880","5690120"," son of a bitch look at that son"

"5820790","5827250"," here let's get back to the original talk so there's something for you to know if you're a seller"
"5827930","5835370"," we're not in crash mode do not if we get into crash mode I will fucking tell you I will"
"5835370","5843130"," know if we're crashing I can tell you right now that I will fucking tell anybody out there I called"

"5892490","5899010"," are at risk of crashing or we are crashing either one you'll tell you as soon as it resolves itself"
"5899010","5902530"," I'll say yeah we'll resolve it's done does it make sense?"
"5903490","5910490"," so if you follow me I can assure you when it's happening I can point and show you in a"
"5910490","5915810"," chart this is it it's happening or this is where the risk is does it make sense?"
"5916510","5922270"," so anyone out there that you're listening to or watching on any fucking video out there has no"
"5922270","5929910"," fucking idea what they're talking about they're out of their fucking minds all of them they're out"

"5952190","5962030"," a fucking way is my point a mile away so if you're a seller your job is to be"
"5962030","5970530"," tactful in your selling when we get to the point where you can say fuck it I'm going to sell"
"5970530","5974730"," my wife and kids I'm going to re-mortgage my house and I'm going to short this fucking pile of"
"5974730","5981670"," shit spine into the dumpster I'll fucking be there with you and we'll do it together until those"

"5995370","6001190"," be smarter you have to rein it in until we go until we get in those conditions where you can"
"6001190","6008310"," just be like fucking I'm hammering the sell button buyers are just looking for a place to buy a"
"6008310","6013690"," fucking dip they're looking to buy the 27 EMA in a daily chart they are every time it hits that"
"6013690","6020690"," which if it ever comes back they want to there are hedge funds out there that are raging pissed"
"6022310","6029150"," because they're being forced to buy the 6 EMA on a daily chart we have not pulled back on this"
"6029150","6035670"," run to the 27 EMA in a daily chart they want to entry there so they're going to go on"
"6035670","6042190"," CNBC they're going to go on Bloomberg News they're going to go on Twitter and they're going to"
"6042190","6047310"," fucking feed you a pile of shit as to why it has to go down or it's going to crash"
"6047310","6053730"," because they're getting fucking loans from the banks and they're going to put this money to work so"
"6053730","6060510"," they can get fat and rich like Gannon said and he's right and so they're going to tell you this"
"6060510","6067510"," so they can buy in they don't want it to crash they want to put their money in and long"
"6067510","6072990"," this fucking market and they don't want to be forced into buying that 6 EMA in a daily chart which"
"6072990","6079650"," is what they're being forced into meanwhile this fucking market is running away from hedge funds"
"6081690","6089430"," and as this market runs away they're pissed off as we trade sideways like we are right now"
"6089430","6095810"," eventually that yellow line and orange line are going to catch up and we're going to rip fucking"
"6095810","6101230"," faces off now they want a better buy-in they're like yeah I want to buy 420 just give me"
"6101230","6106970"," that one just give me 420 if we fucking continue to trade sideways until that orange line comes up"
"6106970","6112910"," there they're going to get left fucking behind and forced to buy this market at our current price"
"6113590","6121330"," at 430, 434 they're not going to get there 420 buy-in but they're going to buy it I promise"
"6121330","6126970"," you they're going to buy it one way or another whether they get there 420 or if they get 434"
"6127590","6132310"," if we trade sideways and there's just continued relentless demand which is what we're witnessing"
"6133650","6140690"," that's why we're not seeing more down there's demand so I'm a hedge fund and I'm pissed off because"
"6140690","6146610"," everybody else is buying and I'm just like I'm a hedge fund can you just let it come down to"
"6146610","6153270"," 420 so we can all buy it and there's some raging bull going fuck you hedge fund I'm buying right"
"6153270","6158030"," fucking now at 430 I don't give a fuck if it goes to 420 I don't care because I know"
"6158030","6165510"," it's going to 450 and 460 so they don't care right so some buyers just don't fucking care that's a"
"6165510","6181090"," bull market god damn it I can't believe I'm fucking lost money in that trade ohh so"
"6184190","6191170"," I'm so fucking pissed right now that was a 100% trade man they could be crawled up the wall"
"6191170","6198410"," so you get my point here I'm done with the rant on this shit so let's be more rational here"
"6199770","6211260"," so we're going to take a look we're going to be rational so we're going to take a look got"
"6211260","6219340"," a couple things this is spy on a weekly let's say we'll do SPX how about that they'll make it"
"6219340","6228660"," simpler for you we got some good crayon drawings here this is a weekly chart on spy why am I"
"6228660","6234220"," showing you this not a daily chart why am I showing you the weekly because we're still in an"
"6234220","6244220"," accumulation phase you see it right here even if we were to go sideways even if we"
"6244220","6252480"," round the top even if we go like this we're still going to go up you see it this is"
"6252480","6261000"," where size enters the market this is where banks buy late market buyers and they drive price higher"
"6262020","6267580"," so I want you to even see this you see it even this here in this last little bit you"
"6267580","6275680"," still see sideways end up I want you to realize that price is going to get driven higher much"
"6275680","6281520"," higher than you think more than likely you can kiss off on all-time highs we're going to probably"
"6281520","6287660"," rip to 46 I mean 46 5,000 or 6,000 if you don't believe that right and you hear"
"6287660","6293280"," people out there talking about this you hear people like my boy out there like fun strat out there"
"6293280","6301360"," saying we're going to 6,000 this is why these things are going to 6,000 for this weekly chart"
"6301360","6309780"," right here this is PMO and PPO now I'll rebarish right now we are but you have to be tactful"
"6309780","6319740"," so if you look at SPX on a daily chart there is some concern for a downside more downside"
"6319740","6326120"," to come there is a little bit of roll here on PPO you see it?"
"6326440","6330840"," I want you to see it right here you see this roll right here in PPO?"
"6331580","6336920"," this is bearish it's bad divergence you don't want to see that on a daily chart on a weekly we're"
"6336920","6342920"," fine on a daily though you see it right here it's a little bit of bearish divergence right here on"
"6342920","6345880"," PMO as well how bearish is it?"
"6346260","6352600"," probably not that bearish that's that sideways and down sideways and down right?"
"6353580","6361920"," rotate and go higher again ultimately in the next two to three weeks we're sideways and down and"
"6361920","6370340"," then we get a huge fucking face ripper right so it's all we're waiting for the consolidation we're"
"6370340","6376220"," waiting for this is not distribution and we are just waiting for another move higher now if price"
"6376220","6382480"," can't get any lower than 432 you're going to be shut out of luck if we don't get 420 if"
"6382480","6388120"," the daily and the weekly move up we are just going to start ripping faces off at some point so"
"6388120","6390220"," my long-term view here is what?"
"6390740","6400640"," bullish very bullish my short-term view here for the month of July is sideways and down until"
"6400640","6406600"," the daily and weekly come up and force us to the upside we should close this month and hear my"
"6406600","6414540"," fucking words this fucking quarter is going to be boom to the upside unless proven otherwise we are"
"6414540","6416500"," fucking bullish you understand?"
"6417160","6421960"," so when someone out there is calling for like extreme bearishness like market crash they're out of"
"6421960","6428640"," their fucking minds if they're calling for a pullback until next week or maybe the 19th or"
"6428640","6437000"," something or 20th that's fine you want to associate this with news whatever the fuck floats your"
"6437000","6443760"," boat if you want to drink the fucking cool aid on fucking rate increases CPI, I don't give a fuck"
"6443760","6451640"," you can fucking I don't care what you associate it with this market is heading higher and this"
"6451640","6461000"," market is poised to move higher so you know like uh, temper your expectations if we have a downside"
"6461000","6467060"," move for any of the reasons that I've seen in the chat today take that as an opportunity to close"
"6467060","6472360"," your puts and get fucking long in this market uh, do not take anything that's going on in this"
"6472360","6477000"," market right now as any sign of a rule over in it we're gonna look at something else here in"
"6477000","6484820"," a minute to back that up uh, all the macro you need shit we're gonna talk about that too so"
"6484820","6488600"," that's my point here as long as you get my point on this the next thing we're gonna look at"
"6488600","6500660"," here is um, we're gonna look at our news and we're gonna go to SPX on this one here's"
"6500660","6505860"," SPX uh, we have the Fed's FED funds rate right?"
"6507520","6514940"," here's the Fed funds rate it's leveling off we are going to continue to expect um, continue to"
"6514940","6522760"," continue to expect uh, rate hikes or the threat of rate hikes um, I think that they pause or they"
"6522760","6529040"," rate, continue to raise maybe slightly more the real key here though is inflation I'm going to pay"
"6529040","6535720"," attention to inflation here this is a year-of-a-year inflation right now it's sitting at $3.95 uh,"
"6536460","6541880"," what I really, what really scares me about this is um, what really scares me right now about this"
"6541880","6549440"," is the unemployment rate or excuse me it's like a it's like a multi-factor whammy that you need to"
"6549440","6556920"," see happen so it's never just one thing nobody gives a fuck about the 2s and 10s nobody I don't"
"6556920","6564900"," fucking care about it you shouldn't care about it it has nothing to do with the market uh, when it"
"6564900","6569460"," starts to come back up right, it's gonna be doom and gloom it can come back up, you need more"
"6569460","6576080"," to the pot you need you need the jobs being offered right, not just unemployment rate but you need"
"6576080","6578720"," jobs offered like jobs, right?"
"6579220","6588760"," to dry up you also need the unemployment rate to begin to come up you need inflation to begin to"
"6588760","6597460"," bottom you need rates to begin to roll over when you begin to see these three things and jobs"
"6597460","6605480"," drying up then the 2s and 10s matter you need a special sauce it's not just, so by the way"
"6605480","6611440"," the fed funds rate this is the inflated inflation and this is the unemployment rate and this is the"
"6611440","6618880"," 2s and 10s so my point to you is this you'll get sub-sellers out there that'll be like the"
"6618880","6625820"," 2s and 10s or they'll be like all the inflation rate all the unemployment rate all the jobs rate"
"6625820","6630540"," they never tell you all of it and there's a more complete picture that you need to be looking at"
"6631120","6637400"," until the secret sauce that's not even secret until you get all the ingredients you can't make a"
"6637400","6647000"," fucking cake I am scared once inflation stops dropping I am scared"
"6647000","6654680"," when the unemployment or when the fed funds rate gets cut I am scared when jobs numbers start"
"6654680","6658860"," looking like dog shit if all of this is happening at the same time and the unemployment rate starts"
"6658860","6666780"," to just start going up when you see all of that that's the time that you get scared that's the"
"6666780","6676740"," time that the 2s and 10s actually fucking matter I can count time and again where the"
"6676740","6683300"," inverted yield curve didn't fucking make a difference to where this market went so it doesn't"
"6683300","6690860"," matter to you as a market participant either you need the secret sauce and furthermore we talked in"
"6690860","6698480"," the past about how the fed is going to change their their QE. "
"6698880","6702880"," We talked about this months ago we talked about how I was like you're probably not ever going to"
"6702880","6708960"," see the old style of QE and QT where it's like a fucking hammer right market goes up, goes down,"
"6709160","6716860"," slams up and down slams up and down due to QE and QT being so being so so so prevalent"
"6716860","6725620"," right Yemen made a good point on this sentiment matters in this as well there is a part of"
"6725620","6730780"," sentiment and that QE doesn't really matter either in the price of the stock market."
"6731300","6740240"," The QE doesn't really matter and he discussed how there's QE being performed through banks you're"
"6740240","6745860"," likely going to see more of this where the QE that's going on remember when regional banks were"
"6745860","6755780"," crashing I posted on Twitter I said bears got fucked the day they saved banks regional banks they"
"6755780","6762620"," broke the agreement with bulls they broke the agreement with bulls that wanted to buy a major"
"6762620","6767800"," bottom they broke the agreement with bears and sellers that wanted to see a major bottom and they"
"6767800","6775240"," started to perform QE in multiple ways saving banks, consolidating banks and then the loans that"
"6775240","6779440"," they're providing to these banks to give to large outside companies."
"6779440","6781860"," They started that in 1978. "
"6783100","6792000"," It hasn't stopped they literally continue to loan money to these companies corporations do this is"
"6792000","6797030"," all corporate debt bond shit this is discount window like all this shit is still going on in the"
"6797030","6802950"," background and they're doing it right fucking now there's QE right now and sentiment is to the"
"6802950","6807350"," upside right now out there and as long as we don't see this stuff here in the macro side of"
"6807350","6813050"," things they're going to run this fucking market up that's what they're going to do until you see"
"6813050","6819070"," this stuff happening then you have your secret sauce batter your baby making batter for your sell"
"6819070","6829430"," side until you get this stuff right the bottoming of inflation the cutting of rates and"
"6829430","6834870"," a rise in unemployment and jobs numbers going into the into the depths of hell then we will deal"
"6834870","6840770"," with the two's and tens so until that happens I'm sorry if your sell side there is no indication"
"6840770","6849530"," out there zero fucking indication out there that we're in due for a market crash for any reason no"
"6849530","6858470"," reason nothing I can see is saying market crash anywhere I see sideways and down PPO and PMO saying"
