"AkmLYEibZH0","20840","22880"," All right, let's see. Are we live or no?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","30000","37000"," Yeah."
"AkmLYEibZH0","60000","67000"," Check 1-2."
"AkmLYEibZH0","120000","127000"," Good morning. Good afternoon. I think it's afternoon at this point. Depending where you are, it's probably nighttime or even early morning."
"AkmLYEibZH0","131000","138000"," Good. A few things we got to do."
"AkmLYEibZH0","139000","146000"," All right. Give me just a moment here, guys."
"AkmLYEibZH0","146000","151000"," Welcome. Happy Sunday to all of you out there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","151000","158000"," Over the weekend,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","158000","162000"," or Friday I lost my voice."
"AkmLYEibZH0","162000","167000"," Gone. Kind of wild."
"AkmLYEibZH0","167000","172000"," I had a whisper to my wife."
"AkmLYEibZH0","172000","179000"," And then it was pretty gone on."
"AkmLYEibZH0","179000","182000"," Pretty gone on."
"AkmLYEibZH0","182000","185000"," There to switch right over."
"AkmLYEibZH0","185000","192000"," Pretty gone on Saturday as well. And then this morning, it's not doing too well, but"
"AkmLYEibZH0","192000","197000"," I'm hoping that it's fine by Monday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","197000","204000"," So I put my phone down on Friday because I didn't want to feel the need to"
"AkmLYEibZH0","204000","207000"," blab on a phone call."
"AkmLYEibZH0","207000","212000"," I've been trying not to speak. I actually didn't speak at all on Saturday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","212000","215000"," No conversations."
"AkmLYEibZH0","215000","218000"," Let me just check the chat here and see how everybody's doing."
"AkmLYEibZH0","219000","222000"," So this will be recorded. This will be recorded."
"AkmLYEibZH0","222000","226000"," Someone's asking, can we record this? I'm doing great. How are y'all doing?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","226000","230000"," Happy Sunday to everybody out there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","230000","234000"," So yes, this will be recorded on YouTube."
"AkmLYEibZH0","234000","238000"," We just make sure YouTube is going. Awesome."
"AkmLYEibZH0","238000","243000"," I see everybody in YouTube."
"AkmLYEibZH0","243000","247000"," Hey, I'm annual. Hi, Binky. Hi, Brian."
"AkmLYEibZH0","247000","251000"," Willie smoked me every other wants to know if we can be cut sections out that kind of"
"AkmLYEibZH0","251000","252000"," stuff as well."
"AkmLYEibZH0","252000","260000"," Trim it down and repackage and make sure it's clear for everybody over the weekend."
"AkmLYEibZH0","260000","265000"," Well, hello, Liam, STT, Voyager, Taylor, Patrick, Kegus."
"AkmLYEibZH0","265000","270000"," No bailout yelling. I think at one o'clock today, we find something out about this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","270000","276000"," I don't know if that's still on the par for the course. I haven't been on social media, so I don't know what's happening out there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","276000","280000"," I have read some news articles. We'll review those. It looks like at 1 p.m."
"AkmLYEibZH0","280000","286000"," There might be a decision made to an emergency meeting to plan, I believe, for tomorrow."
"AkmLYEibZH0","286000","293000"," More in Alexander, Dougie Dee. How are you? Loner. How are you?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","293000","297000"," Oh, let's see who else."
"AkmLYEibZH0","297000","299000"," We've got, uh,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","299000","305000"," Elmerms in here rocks. Ross walks is in here. John Klopp, calm, 19, 106."
"AkmLYEibZH0","305000","308000"," Omar's hair here in the house."
"AkmLYEibZH0","308000","309000"," P.D."
"AkmLYEibZH0","309000","312000"," And God freaks in the house."
"AkmLYEibZH0","312000","315000"," Rex Rex, uh, regacts generator. I like that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","315000","317000"," Zeke forgets or no."
"AkmLYEibZH0","317000","321000"," I don't know."
"AkmLYEibZH0","321000","325000"," We refresh the chat, make sure that everything is rocking and rolling here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","325000","329000"," All right, refresh the chat."
"AkmLYEibZH0","329000","332000"," We'll get right into it this morning. So,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","332000","336000"," it was a pretty big couple weeks here, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","336000","339000"," Uh, we're going to start."
"AkmLYEibZH0","339000","343000"," Let's start with, uh,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","343000","349000"," start with the economic calendar. It's a good one to start with. So."
"AkmLYEibZH0","349000","354000"," We know by looking at, we know by looking at, um,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","354000","356000"," Vol down the road, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","356000","361000"," That we have some coming. We know the market's beginning to price it in."
"AkmLYEibZH0","361000","364000"," All these events, typically we, we buy into."
"AkmLYEibZH0","364000","369000"," The FOMC meetings."
"AkmLYEibZH0","369000","372000"," As not always, but we tend to."
"AkmLYEibZH0","372000","375000"," We've had a lot of all though the past week, right? We've had a lot of all events."
"AkmLYEibZH0","375000","378000"," We were stacked up again for this week into."
"AkmLYEibZH0","378000","383000"," This FOMC."
"AkmLYEibZH0","383000","386000"," Uh, with that said, uh, we've got."
"AkmLYEibZH0","386000","390000"," CPI coming out on Tuesday. Nothing scheduled for Monday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","390000","394000"," This is a big thing to understand. We've got nothing scheduled for Monday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","394000","395000"," We've got."
"AkmLYEibZH0","395000","400000"," An emergency fed meeting that's being that we have these. They're not uncommon."
"AkmLYEibZH0","400000","402000"," When they happen, they tend to be."
"AkmLYEibZH0","402000","407000"," Uh, no, they tend to be, well, I'll read, I'll read an article for you about it,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","407000","411000"," but it tend to be nothing burgers. Uh, when they were when that was talked about on"
"AkmLYEibZH0","411000","414000"," Friday as a potential vol event, it typically or not."
"AkmLYEibZH0","414000","416000"," On my experience, at least historically."
"AkmLYEibZH0","416000","419000"," Uh, so we don't really have anything planned for money."
"AkmLYEibZH0","419000","422000"," It's perfect day for us to bounce."
"AkmLYEibZH0","422000","425000"," Uh, Sunday, today, after tonight, uh, futures, then tomorrow,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","425000","430000"," about and we'll look at the VIX and some previous examples of the VIX."
"AkmLYEibZH0","430000","434000"," Having such a spike, what typically happens, it didn't happen on Friday,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","434000","438000"," but we spoke about it happening on Friday or Monday or over the weekend,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","438000","440000"," where you'd get a reversal."
"AkmLYEibZH0","440000","443000"," What happens after though is usually not good."
"AkmLYEibZH0","443000","446000"," Uh, we'll talk about that leading up to the vol later in the week."
"AkmLYEibZH0","446000","449000"," So you figure Sunday into Monday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","449000","454000"," Or even Friday, we couldn't get it because of, um, uh, we could,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","454000","457000"," we didn't get the bounce. We got the reaction trade lower."
"AkmLYEibZH0","457000","461000"," But, uh, if it happens on Sunday money, we should get a reversal."
"AkmLYEibZH0","461000","465000"," Um, it should happen Friday, Sunday, Monday, somewhere in there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","465000","468000"," And with no, no real news on, on Monday, plus you have."
"AkmLYEibZH0","468000","471000"," We have some other stuff going on today at one o'clock."
"AkmLYEibZH0","471000","476000"," You have Bill Ackman out there saying, uh, to come in and bail out the banks."
"AkmLYEibZH0","476000","479000"," Or at least the mid, the mid-sized banks."
"AkmLYEibZH0","479000","485000"," And can there be systemic contagion around, uh, the markets?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","485000","488000"," And you know, it's specifically, it's not just markets."
"AkmLYEibZH0","488000","490000"," It's, it's not just startups."
"AkmLYEibZH0","490000","493000"," Uh, in tech specifically, there can be panic."
"AkmLYEibZH0","493000","498000"," As a matter of fact, my wife this weekend, uh, went through our banks."
"AkmLYEibZH0","498000","501000"," Structure and, uh, wanted to see."
"AkmLYEibZH0","501000","503000"," If we were okay."
"AkmLYEibZH0","503000","505000"," Not, not surprising."
"AkmLYEibZH0","505000","507000"," And you see older people."
"AkmLYEibZH0","507000","509000"," Uh, concerned about it over the weekend."
"AkmLYEibZH0","509000","511000"," There was talk all over Reddit this weekend."
"AkmLYEibZH0","511000","514000"," Uh, from tech workers saying they might not get paid."
"AkmLYEibZH0","514000","517000"," Let me get this paycheck, but it might not have a job."
"AkmLYEibZH0","517000","520000"," Uh, and it does scare people with money."
"AkmLYEibZH0","520000","523000"," Uh, in tech, and you see some contagion."
"AkmLYEibZH0","523000","527000"," I, I, what, what there was a streaming company that was."
"AkmLYEibZH0","527000","529000"," Um, impacted as well."
"AkmLYEibZH0","529000","530000"," Roku, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","530000","531000"," Was impacted."
"AkmLYEibZH0","531000","533000"," And it lists the skirt up from underneath."
"AkmLYEibZH0","533000","535000"," You've got in, they'll never tell you, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","535000","537000"," You'll never have a large tech company."
"AkmLYEibZH0","537000","540000"," Uh, or a large bank tell you how much exposure they have."
"AkmLYEibZH0","540000","543000"," Uh, in cryptocurrency."
"AkmLYEibZH0","544000","549000"," Um, how much exposure that they have to the second largest bank in history, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","549000","552000"," That, um, is folding right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","552000","557000"," Oftentimes you'll never be told, uh, what's actually happening behind the scenes."
"AkmLYEibZH0","557000","561000"," What, you know, whether there is contagion or not, you're not going to find out."
"AkmLYEibZH0","561000","564000"," As a person on the, uh, man on the street kind of stuff."
"AkmLYEibZH0","564000","566000"," It's always after."
"AkmLYEibZH0","566000","567000"," Uh, for sure."
"AkmLYEibZH0","567000","570000"," Now, so we've got nothing on Monday, Tuesday, we've got CPI."
"AkmLYEibZH0","570000","572000"," That is volatility, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","572000","576000"," Now we have retail sales and, uh, course PPI year over year."
"AkmLYEibZH0","576000","577000"," That's actually taken."
"AkmLYEibZH0","577000","580000"," It's not looked as a vol event for this week, but."
"AkmLYEibZH0","580000","582000"," Uh, it became a vol event."
"AkmLYEibZH0","582000","584000"," The last report that we got."
"AkmLYEibZH0","584000","589000"," Uh, PPI or producer price index actually did matter the last time."
"AkmLYEibZH0","589000","591000"," Uh, we had month over month stuff."
"AkmLYEibZH0","591000","593000"," So that's important to know."
"AkmLYEibZH0","593000","594000"," And then Thursday I've got claims."
"AkmLYEibZH0","594000","596000"," Uh, so it's kind of stacked up, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","596000","598000"," Even though, uh, everyone's looking at CPI."
"AkmLYEibZH0","598000","600000"," It's kind of stacked up for the rest of this week."
"AkmLYEibZH0","600000","604000"," And not a lot of emphasis on these other event economic news events coming out."
"AkmLYEibZH0","604000","606000"," On Wednesday and Thursday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","606000","610000"," Um, then we roll right into the FOMC statement next week on."
"AkmLYEibZH0","610000","612000"," I believe it was the 22nd."
"AkmLYEibZH0","612000","615000"," Uh, this is a statement right here Wednesday, the 22nd."
"AkmLYEibZH0","615000","617000"," Two PM."
"AkmLYEibZH0","617000","619000"," Uh, we have a FOMC meeting."
"AkmLYEibZH0","619000","621000"," They're just kind of rolling right into it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","621000","623000"," More of all."
"AkmLYEibZH0","623000","624000"," Um, more of all."
"AkmLYEibZH0","624000","625000"," That's what we're rolling into."
"AkmLYEibZH0","625000","627000"," And there's the idea that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","627000","631000"," Uh, the yelling in the matter of fact, we talked about 50 BPS and now, uh,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","631000","633000"," friends, uh, had funds future."
"AkmLYEibZH0","633000","637000"," Future rates are saying no, we're definitely doing 25 BPS."
"AkmLYEibZH0","637000","642000"," In this next, um, rate decision that we have broken something."
"AkmLYEibZH0","642000","644000"," Uh, and it is kind of odd to see the argument."
"AkmLYEibZH0","644000","647000"," There's that I just read an article finally on Sunday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","647000","653000"," About the shift of blame and the shift of why SBB is collapsing."
"AkmLYEibZH0","653000","655000"," Uh, and there's two different factions."
"AkmLYEibZH0","655000","657000"," And funnily and funnily enough."
"AkmLYEibZH0","657000","662000"," As we can went forward, I also watched Astro Turfing on Reddit."
"AkmLYEibZH0","662000","664000"," Uh, which I'm assuming."
"AkmLYEibZH0","664000","668000"," I'm not even assuming I'm going to guarantee was paid, uh, to say."
"AkmLYEibZH0","668000","670000"," Everybody calm down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","670000","672000"," Uh, just the, just the tone of it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","672000","674000"," You could tell that it came from."
"AkmLYEibZH0","674000","676000"," Uh, VCs or VC groups."
"AkmLYEibZH0","676000","678000"," Or tech insiders."
"AkmLYEibZH0","678000","680000"," Uh, not to create panic across."
"AkmLYEibZH0","680000","684000"," Um, markets, banks, public opinion, all those kinds of things."
"AkmLYEibZH0","684000","686000"," They don't want to create that, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","686000","688000"," Uh, so that was kind of odd as well."
"AkmLYEibZH0","688000","690000"," Uh, just see, just seeing that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","690000","695000"," Uh, so we do have a bunch of volatility coming up the current current week."
"AkmLYEibZH0","695000","697000"," And then down the road, we have."
"AkmLYEibZH0","697000","699000"," Uh, monthly opex, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","699000","701000"," That's the 17th, I believe."
"AkmLYEibZH0","701000","703000"," Uh, it could be wrong in that, but I think it's the 17th."
"AkmLYEibZH0","703000","705000"," And then we've got the FMC meeting."
"AkmLYEibZH0","705000","707000"," And then we've got the emergency meeting."
"AkmLYEibZH0","707000","709000"," Uh, then we've also have the JPM caller."
"AkmLYEibZH0","709000","714000"," Coming up coming up for the, I believe that the pin is usually in the 17th."
"AkmLYEibZH0","714000","717000"," Uh, and then we lead that into the 31st."
"AkmLYEibZH0","717000","719000"," We trade sideways."
"AkmLYEibZH0","719000","721000"," Uh, into end of, end of quarter."
"AkmLYEibZH0","721000","723000"," And that's what the big question is."
"AkmLYEibZH0","723000","726000"," You remember Mike Wilson saying expect the last leg down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","726000","731000"," Um, then Q one of 2023."
"AkmLYEibZH0","731000","733000"," At least for this bear market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","733000","735000"," So it does bring up those questions, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","735000","738000"," You know that banks are positioned and hedged."
"AkmLYEibZH0","738000","744000"," For, uh, you know, a big down move into the end of this quarter."
"AkmLYEibZH0","744000","745000"," Now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","745000","748000"," Uh, week, a couple of weeks ago, I posted on that captain's office."
"AkmLYEibZH0","748000","752000"," It's a good time to buy, uh, or structure some kind of a hedge."
"AkmLYEibZH0","752000","756000"," We talked about, um, the Dow Jones, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","756000","760000"," The DGIA is, or DIA is a good, good hedge out there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","760000","764000"," Um, and S Dow triple average calls seem like the right play and they're,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","764000","765000"," they're paying out right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","765000","766000"," Very well."
"AkmLYEibZH0","766000","768000"," Uh, June hedges are paying out very well."
"AkmLYEibZH0","768000","772000"," And if you have not had a chance, uh, to get into a hedge,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","772000","774000"," Monday might be a good opportunity."
"AkmLYEibZH0","774000","776000"," You might get an opportunity to hedge this market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","776000","778000"," Uh, on Monday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","778000","781000"," For some further downside into end of quarter."
"AkmLYEibZH0","781000","782000"," Now today is the 12th."
"AkmLYEibZH0","782000","784000"," We've got another, uh, what?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","784000","785000"," I don't know."
"AkmLYEibZH0","785000","787000"," I don't think it's 31 days in the month of March."
"AkmLYEibZH0","787000","788000"," So."
"AkmLYEibZH0","788000","789000"," You got what?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","789000","791000"," 17, 18 days or something like that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","791000","792000"," 17 days, I think."
"AkmLYEibZH0","792000","795000"," Uh, to put a hedge onto the market, if you have not already."
"AkmLYEibZH0","795000","800000"," Some of those pay actually pay quite well, uh, with an upside move."
"AkmLYEibZH0","800000","802000"," Now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","802000","807000"," I don't know if I'm going to get to the, I don't know if I'm going to get to some of the hedges to put on today."
"AkmLYEibZH0","807000","808000"," I don't think I have the time."
"AkmLYEibZH0","808000","812000"," So we might have to do, maybe I'll do a recorded video for that stuff."
"AkmLYEibZH0","812000","814000"," I need to get through the market with you at this moment."
"AkmLYEibZH0","814000","816000"," But I want you to see Ackman here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","816000","818000"," Is calling on the U S government."
"AkmLYEibZH0","818000","823000"," To consider a bailout for S V B if private investors won't step up."
"AkmLYEibZH0","823000","829000"," And I titled this, uh, video, you know, you socialize the losses in these banks."
"AkmLYEibZH0","829000","832000"," Um, and there's some people that don't want that to happen, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","832000","835000"," Uh, there's some people out there that just don't want that to happen."
"AkmLYEibZH0","835000","839000"," They want, uh, they don't, they, if you're going to privatize the, the profits,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","839000","842000"," you should privatize the losses as well."
"AkmLYEibZH0","842000","845000"," Uh, but what does that do to the economy, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","845000","850000"," Uh, and what's interesting is, uh, the quote here is that, um,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","850000","855000"," a billionaire investor, black man says the, the U S government should consider a highly dilutive bailout."
"AkmLYEibZH0","855000","857000"," Of Silicon Valley back amid."
"AkmLYEibZH0","857000","859000"," Jitters about financial position."
"AkmLYEibZH0","859000","861000"," The banks failure could destroy an important long term driver."
"AkmLYEibZH0","861000","867000"," Of the economy as VC back companies rely on S V B for loans and holding their operating cash."
"AkmLYEibZH0","867000","870000"," Ackman said in the series of tweets on Thursday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","870000","875000"," The private capital can provide a solution to highly dilutive, uh, government preferred bailout should be considered."
"AkmLYEibZH0","875000","879000"," Uh, it makes me think that it stinks of, um,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","880000","883000"," Poison maybe in larger banks and you saw JPM take that hit."
"AkmLYEibZH0","883000","885000"," You didn't see GS take that hit."
"AkmLYEibZH0","885000","887000"," And GS on a dot plot."
"AkmLYEibZH0","887000","890000"," I don't have the dot plot here, but you're going to dot plot there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","890000","892000"," They're slightly exposed, not hugely exposed."
"AkmLYEibZH0","892000","895000"," Uh, like some banks and the sim, how to simplify this?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","895000","898000"," Or if you don't understand the concept of this would be."
"AkmLYEibZH0","898000","904000"," Uh, you give me $10 and if you're a traditional bank, I have to keep."
"AkmLYEibZH0","905000","910000"," Let's say $6 in the bank at all times in case there's a run in the bank."
"AkmLYEibZH0","910000","914000"," And this bank FDIC insured didn't."
"AkmLYEibZH0","914000","916000"," They basically kept $3 in the bank."
"AkmLYEibZH0","916000","922000"," Uh, and they had a horrible bond structure as well to cover to cover runs on their bank."
"AkmLYEibZH0","922000","926000"," Um, but there's also the question about cryptocurrency, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","926000","931000"," And losses that stress test that have been done on banks by the fed."
"AkmLYEibZH0","931000","932000"," Are they including any of this stuff?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","932000","934000"," Including cryptocurrency and these stress tests."
"AkmLYEibZH0","934000","938000"," Uh, to what extent are they crypto losses?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","938000","940000"," Um, and the bonds."
"AkmLYEibZH0","940000","942000"," And of course the fed is breaking."
"AkmLYEibZH0","942000","946000"," Uh, the breaking things with raising rates, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","946000","949000"," Which we can actually see in SBB."
"AkmLYEibZH0","949000","951000"," Uh, and then we've got silver gate."
"AkmLYEibZH0","951000","953000"," Uh, these things are some of these things."
"AkmLYEibZH0","953000","958000"," They'll always come back five or 10 years later and say we didn't know."
"AkmLYEibZH0","958000","971000"," Um, uh, the, the depth of, uh, it mechanical issues with, with, uh, new, with new forms of currency with cryptocurrency, how the impact banks and what they're doing."
"AkmLYEibZH0","971000","974000"," As this bill, I've been saying that's kind of a question, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","974000","975000"," It starts to bring up stuff."
"AkmLYEibZH0","975000","978000"," If any of you guys remember back in 2020."
"AkmLYEibZH0","978000","981000"," Started to raise questions about poisoning."
"AkmLYEibZH0","981000","985000"," Uh, of the markets and society with."
"AkmLYEibZH0","985000","987000"," Uh, COVID, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","987000","989000"," And how he was hedged and positioned."
"AkmLYEibZH0","989000","991000"," Uh, then we have got."
"AkmLYEibZH0","991000","1003000"," On mint, the US Federal Reserve will hold a closed door emergency meeting on Monday of the board of governors mid the fall of Silicon, uh, SBB meeting will be held under expedited procedures as set forth on, uh, blah, blah, blah."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1003000","1009000"," According to the state released by a federal review and determine the advance into discount rates to be charged by the Federal Reserve."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1009000","1011000"," During the meeting."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1012000","1017000"," Uh, and also the FDIC fed and treasury will brief California lawmakers on SVP."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1017000","1023000"," That's 11 PM on Saturday after having to cancel a brief meeting originally set for early in the day."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1023000","1032000"," And then the treasure department is set to hold a separate briefing for lawmakers Sunday at 1 PM. One of the people said there's also a, um, uh, press secretary or something for Biden."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1032000","1034000"," That was, uh, elusive."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1035000","1044000"," Somewhat elusive and, um, was yelling on that was yelling made hyper where was, um, Jerome Powell made hyper where it's going on."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1044000","1048000"," So you least know at the, at the top that people are concerned that there is concern."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1048000","1052000"," Uh, have they broken something or they broken something more?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1052000","1055000"," Uh, so I don't think that these are going to be tech."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1055000","1057000"," I think you might hear something today."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1057000","1058000"," It's 1236."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1058000","1060000"," We might hear something at some point today."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1060000","1062000"," Or even a Monday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1062000","1066000"," Now we might hear some kind of, uh, calming into the marketplace."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1066000","1070000"," So it actually sets up for some kind of a green day on Monday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1070000","1073000"," Uh, if we hear those things."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1073000","1075000"," Now we're going to get out of this real quick."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1075000","1078000"," Now we're going to go to."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1078000","1081000"," The economic counter."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1081000","1082000"," That stuff there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1082000","1084000"," We're going to go to."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1085000","1089000"," Uh, this is the, all the macro need to know chart that we use."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1089000","1092000"," And I just want you to see."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1092000","1096000"," Uh, the fed, this is the fed funds rate above right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1096000","1098000"," And if it starts to."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1098000","1102000"," To pause and roll here, if you start to see."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1102000","1104000"," The fed funds rate."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1104000","1107000"," If that helps there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1107000","1109000"," Maybe a little bit lighter."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1110000","1113000"," Start to see the fed funds rate kind of crest here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1113000","1119000"," And you can start to see the curling up slightly of the unemployment rate."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1119000","1124000"," And we're seeing the leveling off of inflation."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1124000","1127000"," And inflation actually has to come down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1127000","1129000"," Uh, yeah, somewhere in it's close to in here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1129000","1133000"," I can bring this one up closer, but I just start to see this stuff."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1133000","1135000"," Right now where we are."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1136000","1140000"," It starts to make you wonder that we're, we're close, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1140000","1143000"," Specifically, let's look at the inflation rate."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1143000","1148000"," And as we start to roll down this inflation rate, I want you to just look back here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1148000","1154000"," And these aren't going to match up exact, but you can kind of see the rolling over of inflation."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1154000","1160000"," The curling up of unemployment and maybe some new rules and unemployment."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1161000","1165000"," And some reinterpretation of unemployment and then the fed fund rate."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1167000","1171000"," Stabilizing and then starting to roll over and that happens tends to happen in markets."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1171000","1174000"," Uh, kind of the same thing right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1174000","1177000"," You see the pre running of unemployment."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1177000","1183000"," You saw you see people in the banking or SVP is going to make a lot of people unemployed."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1183000","1184000"," We know that, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1184000","1186000"," We know it's going to impact a bunch of companies."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1187000","1195000"," $250,000 FDIC is not going to help these workers get their job paid for in a week or two."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1195000","1202000"," So you're starting to try to front run some kind of a topping pattern here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1202000","1206000"," In the market, maybe even a roll into the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1206000","1210000"," Now this is the spy, but if this is SPX."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1211000","1216000"," You start to question if this is going to be the next leg lower or even just an attempt."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1216000","1220000"," Uh, to front run, even if it's only brief, it's only brief in the end of quarter."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1220000","1223000"," We let all this ball come out to the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1223000","1225000"," You get a front running of."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1225000","1229000"," So let's say you front run this event each quarter for 2024."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1229000","1233000"," Even if we don't roll down hard and heavy into a new low in the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1233000","1236000"," There is going to at least be the positioning for it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1237000","1239000"," You hear us talk about retail traders."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1239000","1242000"," We're talking about, uh, I think it was on February 2nd."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1242000","1248000"," Hey, put a hedge in the market with, with some June, um, estal calls, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1248000","1254000"," And now we're talking about any, if you weren't in those calls that if we have a good day up or something like that,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1254000","1260000"," you put another hedge in the market or take the profit and then put another hedge in the market for end of the quarter."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1260000","1262000"," And this should be the standard."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1263000","1268000"," Um, for each quarter for the rest of 2024, unless we, unless we start to track again."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1268000","1271000"," Uh, to break higher, break higher than 420, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1271000","1275000"," To break death, have that no landing situation, which we're not in right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1275000","1281000"," Uh, price is not showing us that we're in that no, no, uh, that no landing."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1281000","1283000"," Uh, trade any longer, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1283000","1284000"," We're not trade."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1284000","1288000"," We're not trying to make attempts higher from 420 to 430 to 440, 460."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1288000","1293000"," And, uh, so it's the time to hedge the market, um, into June now at this point."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1293000","1298000"," Uh, so just this stuff here, looking at this stuff here, it, it's looking like."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1298000","1300000"," It's looking like."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1300000","1305000"," Even if it doesn't play itself out, they should be positioned."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1305000","1309000"," Uh, for some kind of a front running from institutions."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1309000","1312000"," Into, um."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1312000","1316000"," Let me get rid of this one real quick."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1317000","1319000"," Into."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1319000","1321000"," End of quarter."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1321000","1322000"," So."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1322000","1327000"," With that being said, what you need to know for Monday, this is the, this is the juice here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1327000","1329000"," This is the meat of everything."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1329000","1335000"," Is that this sport, this 396 397 somewhere in here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1335000","1338000"," I'll get you an exact price, but."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1338000","1341000"," Let me look at an exact price real quick for you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1342000","1349000"," And we'll get this on another chart here in just a moment as well, but."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1349000","1355000"," One of the key things I want you to realize and know out there is that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1355000","1360000"," Yeah, if we don't get above three, I'll give you an exact number on spy."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1360000","1365000"," If we don't get above 399 78 and hold it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1365000","1368000"," Uh, it's another sell opportunity."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1369000","1373000"," And so if we get this, let's say we get a squeeze higher overnight here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1373000","1377000"," Change the, uh."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1377000","1380000"," And I'll go through the VIX with you in just a moment."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1380000","1384000"," Uh, but we'll go through the VIX, but the, in all honesty."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1384000","1389000"," If we're not going to get above this 390, I think it's 399."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1389000","1393000"," 399 78 is even higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1393000","1396000"," It's way up here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1397000","1401000"," If we don't get it, get above this number up here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1408000","1409000"," Uh, it's going to be bad."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1409000","1411000"," It's going to be bad news for the rest of the week."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1411000","1414000"," There's nothing else I can tell you about that other than that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1414000","1418000"," Uh, this is where your daily trend is above this line here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1418000","1421000"," Uh, your swellers are up here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1421000","1423000"," Your hourly is below."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1424000","1427000"," Um, we could, we could see a nice beautiful day tomorrow."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1427000","1430000"," Cranking day and look at how big that day that would be."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1430000","1433000"," You're talking about not only erasing everything back here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1433000","1436000"," I'm just going to move this over for you a little bit here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1440000","1443000"," You're talking about needing to erase."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1443000","1448000"," Uh, not just the scene of the crime, but to come back and hold above here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1448000","1451000"," Uh, to even begin to talk about bullishness, this market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1451000","1456000"," And if anything, uh, for next week, my expectation is that we'll get,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1456000","1461000"," I expected this either Friday, Monday, somewhere near that you get a swing high."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1461000","1464000"," And we would, we would lose it and start selling down again."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1464000","1467000"," And that's due to the spike in the VIX."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1467000","1471000"," Uh, we haven't, we don't see those spikes frequently when we do see those spikes."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1471000","1475000"," We typically are reversing too much lower lows."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1475000","1478000"," Uh, we tend not to recover."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1478000","1481000"," Uh, we tend not to recover to a bullish stance."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1481000","1484000"," Uh, from those, from those, those VIX spikes historically."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1484000","1486000"," We'll try to take, we'll try to take a look at them."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1486000","1492000"," Uh, but for right now for you for next week, the key level for you is $3.99.78."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1492000","1495000"," If you're a bull, uh, to recover this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1495000","1498000"," It is the place that you would execute as well."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1498000","1500000"," Matter of fact, we'll probably do hedging."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1500000","1502000"," Uh, I'll, come on early tomorrow."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1502000","1505000"," Try to come on tomorrow at eight 30 in the morning."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1505000","1509000"," And we'll talk about, uh, looking for a hedge to place up here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1509000","1511000"," On some kind of a failure."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1511000","1515000"," Uh, for the rest of the week into the 17th into Opex."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1515000","1518000"," And possibly even into the 31st."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1518000","1522000"," And we know that JPM caller doesn't want us above 4060."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1522000","1524000"," Which is somewhere up in here as well, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1524000","1528000"," So all of this stuff is kind of, uh, making sense at this point, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1528000","1529000"," It kind of all."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1529000","1532000"," Jives with each thing in the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1532000","1534000"," Uh, we know that we have the vault."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1534000","1535000"," We have vol on Tuesday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1535000","1536000"," We have all on Wednesday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1536000","1538000"," And then we've got, uh, Opex."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1538000","1540000"," Heading into the 17th."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1540000","1544000"," We know, or we know that they're not going to want price to be about 4060."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1544000","1546000"," So all these things are saying."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1546000","1548000"," Uh, that we get some kind of rejection."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1548000","1550000"," Cause Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1550000","1551000"," Uh, you're going to expect it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1551000","1552000"," And if we don't get it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1552000","1554000"," So we get it by Tuesday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1554000","1556000"," Uh, then we start coming back down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1556000","1558000"," Into some reality into the 17th."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1558000","1564000"," And maybe even further downside into, uh, the FMC meeting on the 22nd."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1564000","1569000"," Uh, which could be, which could be truly the deciding factor."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1569000","1570000"," Into end of month."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1570000","1574000"," If we do get a 50, if he slams the market down one more time."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1574000","1576000"," Into the end of a march."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1576000","1581000"," And maybe we get down to that 3600 or even, uh, 3060."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1581000","1585000"," Uh, uh, uh, uh, if we get down to that 3600."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1585000","1590000"," Uh, we're going to go over some stuff with the spy and SPX."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1590000","1595000"," Uh, but I want to want you to see this that, um, there isn't much support here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1595000","1599000"," I haven't heard this a lot from, I haven't heard this a lot from anyone out there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1599000","1602000"," But I want you to know that there isn't much support here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1602000","1606000"," I want you to know that where we are right now down here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1606000","1609000"," Uh, that we are below the weekly and monthly triggers."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1609000","1612000"," We are below, we are below weekly and monthly support."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1612000","1613000"," In this market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1613000","1616000"," Which combined with buying is very supportive."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1616000","1618000"," So if you just look at this area here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1618000","1620000"," So let's say you have all this accumulation here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1620000","1623000"," You still want this accumulation."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1623000","1626000"," To also be under weekly and monthly support."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1626000","1628000"," Quarterly support and that kind of stuff, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1628000","1630000"," So you have to have four levels to break through."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1630000","1632000"," Uh, they smashed through that stuff."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1632000","1636000"," Uh, into the end of February, all the, all the, all the monthly weekly support."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1636000","1637000"," It's been smashed through."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1637000","1638000"," It's gone."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1638000","1639000"," There's nothing there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1639000","1641000"," So the only thing holding this up right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1641000","1644000"," Are buyers from October and buyers from December."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1644000","1645000"," Uh, that is it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1645000","1646000"," That is all this holding this up."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1646000","1649000"," The next support level is quarterly support."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1649000","1651000"," That's that up 3300."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1651000","1657000"," At any moment, the market is set up here at any moment to rug pull you to rug pull this market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1657000","1660000"," And it's all owned by institutions."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1660000","1663000"," Um, so I don't see that out there right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1663000","1665000"," Talked about and it's an important thing to know."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1665000","1668000"," Is that the market is set to drop to violent lows."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1668000","1674000"," At this moment that they can't get, that they couldn't get through when we were above weekly and monthly support."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1674000","1676000"," Uh, and, and now we are."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1676000","1679000"," So no matter what, anyone else is telling you out there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1679000","1681000"," I'm going to show this to you right now too."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1681000","1683000"," I want to show it to you so that you can understand the concept."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1683000","1686000"," I'm trying to, uh, lay out there for you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1686000","1693000"," Let me just a second here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1693000","1700000"," I want to do one quick thing here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1717000","1723000"," I'm going to try to change the, um."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1723000","1729000"," I'm going to try to show you something here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1729000","1737000"," A different timeframe in a moment, but this is a daily timeframe, but I want you to see on this daily timeframe."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1738000","1743000"," I'm going to see in this daily timeframe, I want you to see."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1743000","1746000"," A couple of things that are happening here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1748000","1751000"," And two of the important ones would be this yellow line right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1751000","1753000"," And this green line right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1753000","1757000"," The, the, these are, this is trend. This is where you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1757000","1762000"," This is trend where the market goes up and down, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1762000","1764000"," Regardless of support in the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1764000","1766000"," And we're below the hourly."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1766000","1769000"," This is the green line in the, in the yellow, the daily."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1769000","1771000"," We're in a bear stance."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1771000","1775000"," Uh, but we've also broken this orange and blue line."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1775000","1777000"," This orange and blue line is actual market support."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1777000","1780000"," Uh, and we smashed into it heavily."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1780000","1784000"," During we smashed into it heavily during."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1784000","1786000"," Uh, the end of month."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1786000","1788000"," I want to see this in February."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1788000","1789000"," Okay."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1789000","1791000"," Came down and we smashed into it here, here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1791000","1795000"," One, two, three, four, five, six, seven times."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1795000","1797000"," Trying to erode."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1797000","1801000"," Uh, automated selling in the market or not selling buying in the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1801000","1804000"," These are sellers selling into the support in the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1804000","1810000"," And they did this brutally, uh, on the beginning on the 21st of February."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1810000","1812000"," And as a matter of fact, here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1812000","1816000"," Uh, we talked about how bulls need to get above the daily here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1816000","1819000"," Uh, for them, for the continuation move."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1819000","1820000"," Higher in the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1820000","1823000"," When they weren't able to do that, we were going down, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1823000","1824000"," When we talked about that, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1824000","1828000"," Once we didn't hold it, hold this and came back down, we said, that's it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1828000","1830000"," The bulls are over here, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1830000","1832000"," We have quick squeeze up and share enough."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1832000","1836000"," We went straight below a weekly and monthly support."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1836000","1839000"," And that's not good for the market here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1839000","1844000"," Uh, it's, it's, it's really bad for the market when we get underneath this weekly."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1844000","1848000"," And monthly, um, support, we're kind of hanging out."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1848000","1849000"," Over here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1849000","1851000"," And I want you to see this in terms of price."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1851000","1855000"," Uh, if we squeeze up into Monday, you see this hourly screaming down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1855000","1858000"," You see this daily screaming down and even weekly."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1858000","1860000"," Screaming down on top of price."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1860000","1862000"," Right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1862000","1866000"," But now can we get a squeeze on this heading into the 17th or 31st."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1866000","1867000"," We can."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1867000","1872000"," And once the ball comes off the market heading into end of quarter, uh, we can get a nice"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1872000","1873000"," violent squeeze higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1873000","1877000"," Uh, but with this ball in the market and the hourly and the daily coming down, uh,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1877000","1878000"," very violent rate."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1878000","1882000"," I can see that the velocity of this hourly coming down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1882000","1884000"," We've got 39159."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1884000","1887000"," It's a key level for you to know."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1887000","1890000"," Uh, to note tomorrow is 39159."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1890000","1898000"," We need to be above that number on Monday for hopefully a move higher into 39 1976."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1898000","1901000"," Uh, 7876 somewhere in there to at least test that number."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1901000","1903000"," And even then we have to get above it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1903000","1906000"," Uh, to consolidate sideways for the hourly to come back up."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1906000","1910000"," And rocket ship, uh, the market back higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1910000","1915000"," Now without that happening, uh, the move is down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1915000","1923000"," And the scary part here is this is where we're going to get into where real support is real true support in the market is."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1923000","1924000"," That it's much lower."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1924000","1928000"," It's, it's, it's, it's down here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1929000","1931000"," This is where quarterly support is."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1931000","1943000"," It's down on, uh, three currently it's at three 29 87, but into April or end of March, it would turn into roughly three 34, three 35."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1943000","1950000"," I just want you to see that, uh, into the end of this quarter, but we can move down there. Uh, do we move down there? I don't know."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1951000","1957000"," At this moment, uh, the key, the key driver here would be if there's a rejection off of 39131."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1957000","1963000"," If there's a rejection off of the three 99 78, uh, I would expect it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1963000","1966000"," Uh, and this is kind of where you put that trade on the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1966000","1969000"," Uh, we're able to put that trade on the market here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1969000","1979000"," If you put a putback spread on the market up here at either 391 or maybe you start a position and then add to it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1979000","1984000"," Here, uh, the key, the key keys here would be if you add that, that putback spread."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1984000","1988000"," Uh, if we do continue higher, uh, that it would be a free trade for you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","1988000","1995000"," If we do reject and roll this market down and over, um, you, you'll get paid as well, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","1995000","2000000"," Uh, you could also wait for, uh, a break higher from 391."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2000000","2007000"," You put the trade on here and, um, see if we break below this, uh, 390 again, again, break below this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2007000","2012000"," 391. If I had to guess, um, we're going to trade up into Monday to that 400."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2012000","2017000"," I'll bounce around waiting for, uh, the FMC heading into the 22nd."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2017000","2022000"," So 39400 somewhere in there and just wait and drop the market whenever they choose."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2022000","2025000"," Uh, into next week."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2025000","2029000"," Uh, so just be conscious of that be conscious of this move down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2029000","2031000"," We're going to go back to."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2031000","2035000"," If I can, uh, I want to show you the."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2035000","2039000"," The VIX really quick."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2039000","2057000"," This applies to ES just SPX, um, as well as, you know, we're going to look at VIX and, uh, we're going to look at a few things here in VIX."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2057000","2062000"," I want to, I want you to see this. I want you to see briefly here in the VIX."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2062000","2065000"," That, uh, the bulls need to get underneath."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2065000","2069000"," Uh, 2157 21."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2069000","2071000"," Uh, 21."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2071000","2075000"," Called at, uh, 2185."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2075000","2078000"," 2154."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2078000","2080000"," Uh, to start to move down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2080000","2083000"," Uh, with this spike up here to 20, 26, 97."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2083000","2086000"," I'm going to show you this on another chart here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2086000","2089000"," Um, how bull should actually looks."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2089000","2095000"," And again, I'm going to bring your attention to, uh, the weekly here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2095000","2097000"," And I want to, this is the three month."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2097000","2101000"," This white line right here. This is a three month support for the VIX."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2101000","2103000"," Quarterly support for the VIX right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2103000","2104000"," 2173."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2104000","2110000"," And then daily at 2053. So key, key numbers for you. 2053."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2110000","2113000"," Uh, 2167."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2113000","2117000"," And also 22, uh, 2221."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2117000","2120000"," Uh, so let's say we see the VIX come down on Monday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2120000","2126000"," You expect the VIX to come down here, but then these drivers right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2126000","2130000"," If this support holds on the VIX."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2130000","2133000"," Uh, I'm going to expect it to, to rip even higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2133000","2137000"," Into, uh, the 17th, which is, uh, Opex."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2137000","2139000"," I'm going to expect that this week to go down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2139000","2140000"," That's what I'm expecting."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2141000","2144000"," Now if we go in here and we bounce around and we start trading sideways."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2144000","2150000"," See VIX breakthrough down to this 20, uh, 20, uh, 20 dollars and 18 cents level."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2150000","2153000"," Well, it might be in a holding pattern to go higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2153000","2156000"," Uh, but for right now, VIX is extremely bullish."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2160000","2161000"," Uh, one day."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2161000","2163000"," Let me see if I'm bringing this up."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2163000","2165000"," Give you a better representation on another chart."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2165000","2167000"," It's just VIX on the weekly here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2168000","2171000"," I'm going to see how bullish VIX actually is in a weekly."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2173000","2174000"," How rare this is."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2174000","2178000"," And when this does happen, uh, some of the events that take place after it,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2178000","2183000"," you can see this, this big huge rip on the VIX here, uh, on a daily candle."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2183000","2187000"," When you see candles like this in the VIX, they tend to have follow through."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2187000","2191000"," You tend to have, uh, one quick down day, a failure to get below."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2191000","2194000"," And then it gets picked right back up and pushed higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2194000","2198000"," Same thing back here and also, uh, we don't, we didn't even my bother."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2198000","2202000"," This is a December of 2021, but when you start to see these candles like this,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2202000","2206000"," unless we get under, uh, get out, get under some key levels here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2206000","2208000"," The VIX even continues to go higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2208000","2213000"," I want you to see that, uh, that the bears are in charge here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2213000","2218000"," Bears are in charge right now at 2,178 20, 53."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2218000","2221000"," Uh, so if you're a bull, that's what you're looking for."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2221000","2225000"," If you can't get underneath that 20, 53 and start to reverse trend,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2225000","2227000"," I'm going to assume that that, not even going to assume."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2227000","2229000"," I pretty much know that that's above 400."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2229000","2233000"," Um, you're going to want me to be looking for price to be above 400"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2233000","2239000"," in VIX to get underneath 20, 52 and start selling down again."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2239000","2243000"," Uh, when you see these candles historically, they tend to mean something."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2243000","2246000"," They tend, they tend to imply that, uh, something's going on."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2246000","2248000"," Another thing I want you to look at is HYG real quick."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2248000","2253000"," And I want you to see HYG here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2253000","2258000"," Uh, we've got, so HYG, this is a daily, a daily chart, but I want,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2258000","2261000"," I'm going to leave the daily and the weekly with you on HYG."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2261000","2263000"," We've got a giant gap down here that hasn't been filled."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2263000","2266000"," We thought we were going up here to close this gap above."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2266000","2269000"," Uh, we're closer to this gap below and not surprisingly,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2269000","2271000"," price is actually bull."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2271000","2274000"," I'm going to show you this green, move, remove this green bar right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2274000","2279000"," You can see that we're losing right now and velocity is coming to the downside"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2279000","2282000"," on, on, uh, HYG right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2282000","2288000"," So if HYG needs to get above 74, 25, um, this needs to get bought tomorrow."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2288000","2293000"," And we actually need to get above."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2293000","2298000"," Uh, 40, 74, 25."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2298000","2302000"," If we don't, if we can't achieve this, uh, the move is down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2302000","2308000"," If we get this move down, uh, you're, you're talking about, this is the October low down here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2308000","2309000"," Right."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2309000","2310000"," And this is three, four."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2310000","2315000"," I believe, no, yeah, I was just, I think this is three 45, um, in the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2315000","2320000"," So if this is three 45, we've come down here and we start breaking down here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2320000","2321000"," What, what does this relate to?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2321000","2324000"," This is, I believe this is the October low down here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2324000","2326000"," This is December low right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2326000","2327000"," We haven't even seen this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2327000","2329000"," This is December low right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2329000","2332000"," And this is the October low down here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2332000","2337000"," We haven't even seen price in the S&P 500 show the December low at this point."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2337000","2342000"," Um, so just be conscious of this of, of HYG if it continues to go down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2342000","2346000"," Uh, you don't want to see a rejection above on 74, 25."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2346000","2348000"," Uh, all the moves have shown that we're going to go lower."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2348000","2352000"," And as a matter of fact, HYG isn't even showing the true price of spy right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2352000","2356000"," So, and then that's true to some of the, uh, where XLF got hammered."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2356000","2361000"," Other parts of the sub sectors of spy have not shown lower prices yet to take it down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2361000","2365000"," We're going to look at the weekly on HYG as well."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2365000","2369000"," And, uh, the weakness, the price action."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2369000","2373000"," Uh, we are below the red, the yellow and the white right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2373000","2375000"," I'm going to show HYG."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2375000","2379000"," 30 minute chart."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2379000","2389000"," And where it's targeting HYG."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2389000","2394000"," I want you to see this, the, I want you to see the bearishness in HYG right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2394000","2400000"," Uh, you're below the, uh, three month, the quarterly, the, uh, monthly."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2400000","2405000"," And then also the weekly and the daily and, uh,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2406000","2409000"," And the, uh, hourly on HYG."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2409000","2412000"," Just look, just, I want you to just see that the violence in this move here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2412000","2414000"," And I want you to see above here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2414000","2416000"," 75."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2416000","2419000"," I said 7450, but it's actually higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2419000","2422000"," 7512."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2422000","2424000"," On HYG."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2424000","2426000"," Not healthy is it?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2426000","2427000"," It's not looking good right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2427000","2429000"," We weren't able to hold above."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2429000","2431000"," We had this break below."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2431000","2433000"," On February, uh, 23rd."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2433000","2435000"," 21st, 23rd."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2435000","2439000"," And it's showing us, it's showing us future price, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2439000","2443000"," So remember we were smashing into the weekly and 21st of February."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2443000","2445000"," And price hadn't shown itself."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2445000","2448000"," Lower lows on spy."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2448000","2451000"," Uh, yet HYG was showing it to us, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2451000","2454000"," See the breakdown here of HYG before price."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2454000","2456000"," Followed on spy and SPX."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2456000","2459000"," And we're seeing it again."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2460000","2462000"," We're seeing it develop ahead of time right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2462000","2463000"," So."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2463000","2465000"," If you're just looking forward."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2465000","2468000"," In the market, if you're pulling out a crystal ball."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2468000","2473000"," If you're trying to say, uh, where will price lead and spy and SPX."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2473000","2475000"," HYG is telling you right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2475000","2481000"," That, uh, even though spy isn't down at 360 or 3060."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2481000","2485000"," Um, right now HYG is telling you, you should be looking for this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2486000","2488000"," Retesting the lows down here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2488000","2491000"," Um, on 21st of February."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2491000","2495000"," And then we're retesting the lows again in this close on Friday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2495000","2498000"," And if this continues to this downward move."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2498000","2501000"," Uh, you're going, uh, all of these averages start moving down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2501000","2505000"," And price starts to follow even if spy and SPX aren't there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2505000","2509000"," You should see lower lows in, uh, the S&P 500."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2510000","2513000"," We'll get Dixie real quick as well."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2517000","2519000"," Bear town, baby."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2519000","2521000"," Love that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2521000","2523000"," Bear town."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2523000","2525000"," And we're going to get at Dixie."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2525000","2529000"," Dixie is not as a conclusive on this, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2529000","2535000"," Not as conclusive right now in Dixie, but Dixie is holding up on its monthly"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2535000","2536000"," support right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2537000","2540000"," It's also holding up on its daily support right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2540000","2544000"," Uh, so this is another, uh, another thing that's telling you that prices can go"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2544000","2548000"," higher, although there is resistance on the weekly on Dixie."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2548000","2553000"," Uh, if we get a 50 BPS rate hike, you're going to see Dixie rip face and faces off"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2553000","2554000"," in this market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2554000","2556000"," And you're going to see the daily trigger hold up."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2556000","2562000"," So I'm going to be aware of, uh, probably two, two key drivers here on Dixie."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2562000","2566000"," And that would be, uh, 104, 288."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2566000","2570000"," And then below two, we get, move this over here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2570000","2572000"," Get ready so you can see it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2572000","2576000"," Uh, what key one would be this 10955."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2576000","2582000"," Uh, so if you see a Ripper on Monday, let's say, or Monday into Tuesday, uh,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2582000","2586000"," you're probably going to see 400 is going to be roughly right around, uh,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2586000","2587000"," 104."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2588000","2592000"," Uh, you're probably going to see 400 is going to be roughly right around, uh,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2592000","2594000"," 104.99, believe it or not, somewhere in there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2594000","2598000"," Uh, so you could see Dixie fall off, uh, into Monday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2598000","2602000"," And then you'll be waiting for some kind of a snapback higher, uh,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2602000","2604000"," for continuation for the bears."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2606000","2609000"," So I'd expect some violence in Dixie that this upcoming week, believe it or not."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2609000","2614000"," If Dixie holds on while the market is squeezing higher, it's going,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2614000","2616000"," let's say Dixie holds on the market squeezes on Monday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2616000","2621000"," That's going to, that's going to be a sure sign that this is only a bear market"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2621000","2622000"," squeeze."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2622000","2623000"," That's it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2623000","2628000"," If you see Dixie hold on, uh, let's say 104.262 coming into Monday,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2628000","2632000"," you know, you're coming to the stream and you'll say, Hey, Cap, why is Dixie not moving?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2632000","2638000"," It's going to be a sure sign that this is just a squeeze and not a bull run at some point."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2638000","2642000"," Uh, so if you're like, Hey, I'm looking for that for our bullish move higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2642000","2645000"," Let's say we trade to 400 on Monday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2645000","2649000"," And you don't see Dixie just, just melting down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2649000","2653000"," Uh, it's not going to be an indicator that any move higher is real."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2653000","2655000"," It's a fake move higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2656000","2659000"," So keep your eyes on Dixie as we move forward."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2660000","2662000"," So it's looking pumpy, isn't it?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2662000","2664000"," Dixie's not that this is the weekly."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2664000","2666000"," Dixie's looking pretty strong right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2666000","2670000"," Uh, so just as a weekly chart right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2670000","2674000"," That looks kind of bullish to me, not fully bullish, but kind of bullish."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2674000","2678000"," So you're looking for Dixie to hold 104 or two, five."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2678000","2680000"," Dixie is looking pretty strong right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2680000","2683000"," Uh, so just as a weekly chart right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2683000","2686000"," So you're looking for Dixie to hold 104 or two, five."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2686000","2690000"," It begins to have a serious breakdown to one on one 81."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2690000","2694000"," Uh, you will see, uh, higher highs from 400."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2694000","2698000"," Another one to be looking at today is TLT."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2698000","2701000"," And we've talked about TLT."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2701000","2702000"," This is a weekly."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2702000","2704000"," We'll look at the daily."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2704000","2707000"," We've been talking about TLT since the first of the year."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2707000","2711000"," And we, when we talk about TLT since the first of the year."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2712000","2717000"," And we, when we talked about TLT beginning of the year, we had said, uh, the initial rip up."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2717000","2720000"," Uh, we'd, we'd look for the rip down to about, to about 100 bucks."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2720000","2725000"," We'd expect that to be bought all through, uh, uh, 2023."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2725000","2729000"," Uh, and then we would expect a rip at some point this year."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2729000","2732000"," So if you're looking at Dixie."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2732000","2735000"," It's behaving like."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2735000","2740000"," It's behaving like we expect a recession to come."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2741000","2746000"," And this would be where you're able to buy a dip on Dixie multiple times in 2023."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2746000","2751000"," It should track like we talked in the early January track like this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2751000","2755000"," You come up down, up down, up down, up down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2755000","2759000"," And then by, we said, I think we said by summer, like June or July."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2759000","2764000"," You expect a final face rip and rally up higher in the markets to roll over."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2764000","2767000"," Um, the SMB 500 to roll over."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2767000","2770000"," Now, whether that happens, whether that happens."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2770000","2775000"," Q one, Q two, Q three or Q four, we don't know."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2775000","2778000"," Uh, but you can see this playing out, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2778000","2783000"," This recession trade is actually playing out like it has, uh, in the past."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2783000","2789000"," We're going to take a look at, um, Tesla and NVIDIA next."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2789000","2793000"," And then you got, I want you guys to think about some stock tickers for me to look at."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2794000","2798000"," Uh, we, we can look at NNDX, IWM, if you want RTY, whatever you guys want."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2798000","2805000"," We're going to look at two specifically. We're going to look at, um, Tesla and, uh, and video."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2805000","2808000"," And we're going to talk about this in stream last week."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2808000","2811000"," But what I really want you to see is."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2813000","2815000"," The difference in."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2816000","2819000"," In stance on a tech stock."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2820000","2825000"," I want you to see the difference in, uh, what is a bullish looking stock and what is not."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2827000","2830000"," When you have confidence, uh, in its trade versus."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2831000","2833000"," No confidence in a trade."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2834000","2837000"," If I can delete some, uh, delete some."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2837000","2839000"," Just remove some drawings here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2840000","2842000"," And we're going to go back."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2842000","2844000"," We're going to have to do one more thing."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2844000","2846000"," I'm going to go back and show you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2846000","2849000"," Something in SP and SPX and spy."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2849000","2854000"," After I go over Tesla and I missed one, I missed one topic I wanted to speak about."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2854000","2861000"," And that was how to watch how they front run, um, money in the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2861000","2864000"," Or front run, uh, a, a larger move down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2865000","2868000"," Now in video."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2868000","2870000"," We're going to start with this one."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2870000","2873000"," Just on a basis of health."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2873000","2874000"," Of a stock."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2874000","2876000"," It's above its monthly."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2876000","2877000"," It's above its weekly."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2877000","2878000"," It's above its daily."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2878000","2880000"," It's above its hourly right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2880000","2882000"," Uh, when you see stuff like this happening."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2882000","2887000"," Um, this is a 30 minute chart right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2887000","2890000"," Now price right now is below its."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2890000","2893000"," Hourly trigger and it's heading into check."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2893000","2894000"," It's daily."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2894000","2896000"," That's that two, two, one, three, seven."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2896000","2900000"," Uh, as long as it stays above its daily."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2900000","2905000"," And then the one five minute and the hourly come back down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2905000","2908000"," Um, I'm going to expect NVIDIA to continue higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2908000","2911000"," Oh, not until NVIDIA breaks below its hourly."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2911000","2913000"," Do I see a trend change?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2913000","2916000"," Like, uh, so, uh, do I do it?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2916000","2917000"," Do I see a trend change?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2917000","2925000"," Like, uh, do I do I ever see a trend change that's, uh, bearish."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2925000","2929000"," Or mean something in terms of price, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2929000","2934000"," Get below that daily and you actually start to see some pretty, some pretty, uh, big,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2934000","2935000"," significant lows."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2935000","2941000"," Otherwise buyers of NVIDIA, uh, you know, they're doing quite well here, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2941000","2942000"," They bought back in October."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2942000","2946000"," They have bought in December and you can see that NVIDIA has not felt."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2946000","2948000"," Much of this move yet, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2948000","2952000"," Where finance has or the financial sectors have NVIDIA has not."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2952000","2957000"," And if they can hold this two, twenty one, fifty eight, they look bullish to me."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2957000","2963000"," I don't, I don't have a bearish take or stance on NVIDIA."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2963000","2967000"," Now in Tesla."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2967000","2970000"," It's a little bit the opposite, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2970000","2973000"," It's kind of the opposite right here, isn't it on Tesla?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2973000","2978000"," You can see that we're below the week, the monthly, we're below the weekly."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2978000","2984000"," The daily is curling over on Tesla."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2984000","2986000"," You can see it right here in Tesla."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2986000","2988000"," Price is below the hourly as well."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2988000","2991000"," Now, I think Tesla will squeeze on Monday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2991000","2993000"," I think it does squeeze."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2993000","2995000"," Looking kind of bullish in here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2995000","2996000"," Can it squeeze?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","2996000","2997000"," Yes."
"AkmLYEibZH0","2997000","3000000"," Maybe a target of one eighty six seventy one on Tesla."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3000000","3003000"," You could see a trade higher than one eighty six seventy one."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3003000","3006000"," But if you get this trade on Tesla."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3006000","3010000"," Squeeze this up in the hourly and the weekly comes over still upon it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3010000","3014000"," You're then talking about a break of this hourly here in price."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3014000","3016000"," And the move is lower on Tesla."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3016000","3018000"," So look for one eighty six ish."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3018000","3020000"," Maybe one eighty four on Monday and Tesla."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3020000","3024000"," For Tesla to get bullish again."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3024000","3025000"," It's much higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3025000","3027000"," It's we've talked about this in the past."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3027000","3030000"," It's now it's at two twenty four."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3030000","3034000"," Currently it's at two twenty two forty."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3034000","3035000"," For Tesla."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3035000","3037000"," Until we see that on Tesla."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3037000","3041000"," There's no trade for me or there's no there's no buying of Tesla for me."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3041000","3048000"," I have I have no business here buying Tesla at this price."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3048000","3054000"," And currently if we if we start to break down on Monday, if we break down below one seventy one."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3054000","3059000"," I'm looking for a retest of the lows down here and closing the gap in ninety five."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3059000","3062000"," And then I believe it's fifty two dollars below that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3062000","3067000"," A significant trend change in Tesla is awaiting."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3067000","3071000"," So if you're long Tesla and you don't have a hedge on the market on Tesla."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3071000","3076000"," You should be looking to put one on for protecting yourself up here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3076000","3081000"," Especially at one eighty six fifty one eighty six fifty four."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3081000","3084000"," Probably slightly lower probably one eighty five one eighty four."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3084000","3089000"," I know sellers are going to attempt to step in at that point and sell Tesla down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3089000","3093000"," And you can just see the stance right now in Tesla versus Nvidia."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3093000","3094000"," And it's different."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3094000","3099000"," There's a different stance here in Tesla than there is on let's say in V."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3099000","3102000"," I think the two prime stocks to look at."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3102000","3103000"," Now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3103000","3105000"," For any of you bulls out there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3105000","3107000"," They're like I were not selling this market cap."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3107000","3109000"," You don't know what you're talking about."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3110000","3111000"," You do have."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3111000","3114000"," You do have something on your side and that is Apple."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3114000","3117000"," Apple is holding this market up."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3117000","3121000"," So the question becomes does Tesla decouple from this market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3121000","3123000"," So if you're looking at Apple here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3123000","3131000"," There's two nice lows you're going to be looking forward to hold this market into not see thirty like three thousand thirty three hundred twenty eight hundred."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3131000","3133000"," This is the no landing crowd."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3133000","3137000"," You want to see Apple hold one forty six fifty seven."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3138000","3142000"," And then also possibly one thirty nine forty four net the worst case."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3142000","3148000"," Is one twenty four eighty five and that goes back to January fifth right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3148000","3151000"," Now on a larger time frame."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3159000","3163000"," Right here now we've got that low down there one twenty four fifty nine."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3164000","3166000"," It's kind of kind of what I'm looking for."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3166000","3169000"," They're not going to unless we have something broken with the banks."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3169000","3172000"," Maybe a retest of that one twenty four."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3172000","3176000"," You'll be looking for maybe thirty three hundred thirty six hundred in the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3176000","3180000"," You start to see Apple trade down to this one twenty four in that case."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3180000","3184000"," You'll be looking for a dip to buy in the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3184000","3186000"," Unless you get a bank contagion."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3186000","3188000"," They're going to hold up up Apple."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3188000","3189000"," There they are."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3189000","3190000"," That's just what they're going to do."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3191000","3193000"," That's what it's one of their favorite things to do."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3193000","3197000"," So one twenty four oh five for the retest on Apple."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3198000","3202000"," One thirty nine twenty one on Apple and then."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3203000","3205000"," Right here one forty six thirty three."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3205000","3208000"," Those are your two three large supports on Apple."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3208000","3214000"," And I am going to expect Apple to sell on Monday at one fifty one eighty five."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3215000","3217000"," Right in."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3218000","3220000"," Right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3223000","3228000"," I'm going to expect Apple to recover on Monday trade up to."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3228000","3231000"," Yeah, right about one fifty one seventy nine."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3231000","3235000"," And then and then they start turning around for end of month."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3235000","3241000"," Down here and possibly get down to like one forty five or so into end of quarter at least."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3242000","3244000"," If you start if you start to see thirty six hundred."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3245000","3247000"," You're looking at one thirty nine thirty five."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3249000","3251000"," And then below one below thirty six hundred."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3251000","3255000"," You're looking to retest one twenty five down below."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3256000","3257000"," Down here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3257000","3258000"," That's their baby right."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3258000","3259000"," You see you can see it right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3259000","3260000"," That's their baby."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3262000","3265000"," We look at the comments right now and see what you guys are talking about."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3267000","3269000"," And I will bring back."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3269000","3271000"," We'll start looking at your favorite tickers here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3274000","3275000"," Try not to give me."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3276000","3278000"," You know, you're going to give me a ticker to do."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3280000","3281000"," Make sure they're not."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3281000","3282000"," They don't all look the same."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3283000","3284000"," You know, if I start to start."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3285000","3287000"," There's a lot of these tickers are going to look the same."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3289000","3292000"," I might pass over your ticker if you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3295000","3297000"," Let's look at some of what you guys are saying in the chat."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3300000","3301000"," Uh."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3304000","3305000"," Now it's becoming today cap."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3305000","3306000"," Yeah, I think this should be an announcement."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3306000","3307000"," It's a one thirteen."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3307000","3308000"," Is there an announcement right now?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","3308000","3309000"," I haven't checked."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3318000","3320000"," Let me go through what you guys are saying here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3322000","3325000"," Let me just say and I want to make sure I'm up to date and all of the."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3326000","3327000"," All right, you guys are going."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3329000","3331000"," You guys are going to go through it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3331000","3332000"," What do you some of you guys are saying?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","3335000","3339000"," He has his name for a swift deal, but winter won't be known until late Sunday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3339000","3340000"," Okay, so they've changed that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3346000","3347000"," Okay, wait."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3347000","3348000"," So you're asked."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3348000","3349000"," I could ask the cap to wait."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3351000","3352000"," In the morning to buy options."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3352000","3353000"," 30 minute one."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3353000","3354000"," I already buy it open."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3355000","3360000"," Uh, so Friday about calls for Monday and then I bought really cheap, uh, puts for a crash."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3362000","3365000"," Um, really dirt cheap, uh, like penny puts."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3366000","3370000"," In case we don't squeeze on Monday case, in case there was contagion over the weekend."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3371000","3378000"," Uh, but normally I can see before the open the next day where it's implied if we're going to go operate off the opening bell or not."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3379000","3381000"," There's a bunch of factors that are included in that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3381000","3385000"," Sometimes I don't hold is I don't buy often the night before as much as I used to."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3386000","3388000"," Uh, being in a bear market, it's, it's been more of a challenge."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3389000","3390000"," I went on a bull market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3390000","3392000"," It's easier to see if we're going to go up the next day or not."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3394000","3395000"," Uh, do I let the market breathe?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","3395000","3399000"," I tend to let the market breathe on the open unless I know where it's going."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3399000","3404000"," Normally, normally you can kind of tell before normally you can kind of tell before the opening bell."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3405000","3411000"," If we're going to, uh, red bar down or green bar it up, uh, people do though do say it's better to let the market breathe."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3412000","3420000"," Uh, before, uh, trading and in this program ourselves, we're going to, we are switching to a new format to kind of slow down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3421000","3422000"," Uh, the trading."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3423000","3424000"," Uh, for live streams."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3424000","3425000"," It's just easier."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3426000","3428000"," Yeah, we'll look at the market breath as well."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3428000","3429000"," I should have done that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3429000","3430000"," I didn't do that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3430000","3437000"," Let's do a market breath real quick and, uh, I think it's here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3437000","3440000"," See if I can get the market breath up for you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3444000","3445000"," Uh, such as a market breath real quick."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3445000","3447000"," This is SPX market breath."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3447000","3452000"," Uh, utilities down to 3.3."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3452000","3454000"," I'd expect a bid in utilities at that low."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3454000","3457000"," Uh, real estate is at zero."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3457000","3460000"," Uh, finance is at zero."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3460000","3462000"," And I haven't looked at a KRE at either."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3462000","3464000"," I'd stay away from KRE."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3464000","3467000"," I'd stay away from XLF."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3467000","3469000"," I gotta be honest with you guys out there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3469000","3471000"," If you're a young trader."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3471000","3474000"," Uh, if you're a young trader, if you're a young trader,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","3474000","3479000"," uh, if you're a young person, if you're under the age of."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3479000","3482000"," Maybe 35."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3482000","3485000"," Uh, it's hot with 35 40 somewhere in there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3485000","3487000"," If you're under 40 years old."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3487000","3490000"," I can assure you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3490000","3494000"," I don't know if that's the exact age, but it's somewhere in there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3494000","3498000"," If you weren't a young adult, maybe let's, let's say 18 or older."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3498000","3502000"," In 2007, 2008."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3503000","3505000"," I'm telling you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3505000","3509000"," That you may or may not know this, but S V B."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3509000","3512000"," Is panicking a lot of people."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3512000","3516000"," Real traders, real floor traders."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3516000","3524000"," Um, pit traders, um, market makers, anyone, anyone that was around."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3524000","3527000"," Pre 2008."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3527000","3530000"," If they're not telling you this publicly."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3531000","3533000"," I'm telling you that they."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3533000","3538000"," A lot of these people didn't even take part in the 2020 trade."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3538000","3541000"," Because of they remember."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3541000","3546000"," Uh, that when things get bad, they don't even get told."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3546000","3548000"," Uh, professionals."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3548000","3550000"," Don't get told."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3550000","3555000"," Um, when banks close, they're picking up boxes and being kicked out the front door."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3555000","3556000"," And they're not told."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3556000","3558000"," So when they hear things like the banks."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3559000","3561000"," Even if they're not scared."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3561000","3563000"," They're concerned."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3563000","3565000"," I need you to understand that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3565000","3568000"," I need you to understand that banks are not to be trusted ever."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3568000","3574000"," I need you to know that banks used to be a high, uh, the driver of the market, the darlings of the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3574000","3576000"," They used to be trusted."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3576000","3579000"," And they'll never be trusted again."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3579000","3580000"," Ever."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3580000","3584000"," And you, you have to write in your rules that you write your big toolbox."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3585000","3588000"," That should be like on the, in your garage where you keep your toolboxes."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3588000","3592000"," You put a sign on the wall that says never trust a fucking bank."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3592000","3595000"," Uh, they will fucking lie to you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3595000","3598000"," They will fucking lie to you and they will fucking lie to you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3598000","3602000"," Uh, they will roll up the front door step and not tell you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3602000","3605000"," Uh, they will tell you everything is fine when it's not."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3605000","3610000"," And whenever you hear, uh, that's like SBB going down, Silvergate going down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3610000","3615000"," And when you hear stuff all happening in crypto and in Bitcoin and tethers."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3615000","3617000"," It's one thing, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","3617000","3620000"," It's one thing when you, and when you break things, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","3620000","3625000"," When the Fed is breaking things, you don't mind seeing some things break."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3625000","3628000"," It's kind of like seeing like an apple break."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3628000","3630000"," You don't want to see apple break."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3630000","3632000"," There's some, some companies you do want to see break."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3632000","3637000"," I don't want to see Tesla break, but there are people out there that are like, yeah, if they break Tesla, that's good."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3638000","3641000"," When you start to see like, uh, large banks."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3641000","3643000"," Start to break or crack."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3643000","3648000"," Uh, there's two things that it raises two questions and this, this is real."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3648000","3651000"," That the Fed is going to pause."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3651000","3653000"," Or have to step in."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3653000","3655000"," Or."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3655000","3660000"," There's some real bad shit coming that they won't be able to stop happening."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3660000","3665000"," Unless there's more than cutting of rates, like true intervention."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3666000","3668000"," The banks are never going to tell you this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3668000","3670000"," They're never going to tell you the truth."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3670000","3673000"," Uh, they're going to roll up shop before you ever fucking see it coming."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3673000","3675000"," And I don't care if you got a pension, a 401k."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3675000","3676000"," I don't care what you have."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3676000","3680000"," I don't care if you've got, I don't care what you have what you say."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3680000","3682000"," I remember."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3682000","3684000"," Uh, there was run."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3684000","3686000"," I tried to look up some video on this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3686000","3689000"," On YouTube, like prior video from 0708."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3689000","3691000"," And I can't find it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3691000","3694000"," And it's probably been, it's probably been put in a vault somewhere."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3694000","3697000"," But there was a panic in the US."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3697000","3701000"," There was panic in Europe in England, but there was panic in the United States."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3701000","3704000"," There were people lined up at banks around the country."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3704000","3709000"," Even if they didn't have to worry when they didn't get a lot of these banks didn't pay."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3709000","3715000"," Uh, these, they didn't allow the withdrawal over $250,000 for weeks."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3715000","3718000"," Uh, sometime in some cases months."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3718000","3722000"," Your money was tied up in these banks."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3722000","3724000"," So, and I, I've had a hard time."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3724000","3726000"," I've been searching for this stuff and haven't able to find it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3726000","3729000"," It's almost like it's been swept under a rug, but that shit was real."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3729000","3731000"," I remember it happening."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3731000","3737000"," Uh, so it's what, so when you're seeing like, when you're seeing this stuff out there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3737000","3743000"," Uh, it, it, it, it tweets that they're like, it's like the, uh, you're a bad experience."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3743000","3745000"," You know, car accident or something."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3745000","3747000"," And then years later, you're driving the same way."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3747000","3749000"," It says it's a, it's black ice in the road."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3749000","3751000"," And you're like, Oh, I remember that car accident."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3751000","3755000"," I think that is the, the knee jerk reaction from older people."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3755000","3757000"," You know, I think that's, that's real."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3757000","3761000"," And the, the, even if there isn't a contagion in the banks."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3761000","3766000"," Um, if it was a sell side hedge funds that we're trying to say, fuck it,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","3766000","3767000"," we're going to get this price lower."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3767000","3772000"," If it was the Fed, if it was somebody out there trying to do it, not only did they accomplish it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3772000","3776000"," But now, uh, you people are going to be scared."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3776000","3778000"," Venture capitalists are going to be scared."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3778000","3781000"," There is a, there is definitely in the background."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3781000","3783000"," If there wasn't money in the market before."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3783000","3786000"," There definitely isn't money in the market now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3786000","3791000"," There's definitely going to be, I'm going to pull, not only not, not, not."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3791000","3795000"," Not only not going to dabble and are putting some, some risk on."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3795000","3797000"," I'm fucking waiting until."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3797000","3799000"," I know more."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3799000","3802000"," And I think that's a key difference here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3802000","3804000"," Um, we're not a key difference."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3804000","3807000"," And when you start to see a bank go down like this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3807000","3809000"," It, it, it lends in pause."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3809000","3813000"," I'm, I'm sure that there are meetings, risk man, meetings over this weekend."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3813000","3815000"," Going on behind closed doors."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3815000","3818000"," Um, I'm 100% sure."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3818000","3823000"," Uh, that the companies are, uh, looking into their exposure."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3823000","3826000"," Uh, in banking apps are fucking lutely."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3826000","3830000"," Uh, and I'm sure there's some old fucking guy out there somewhere that's like,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","3830000","3833000"," Hey, you know, uh, I know you can think."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3833000","3836000"," Uh, I know you can think you can trust your bank, but you're more than likely."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3836000","3837000"," You can't."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3837000","3842000"," And this is a, this is a divergence."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3842000","3845000"," That has to be resolved at this point."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3845000","3847000"," And not reassured."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3847000","3853000"," Uh, the reassurance from the treasury department to reassurance and the Fed does not work."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3853000","3858000"," Uh, once you let that cat out of the bag, the moment you open that bag open and say."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3859000","3864000"," Uh, we might have some, some, some regional bank systemic."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3864000","3866000"," Uh, problems."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3866000","3871000"," The moment you do that, I guarantee you guarantee you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3871000","3873000"," That even if they're not saying it publicly."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3873000","3875000"," Behind the scenes."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3875000","3880000"," There are, there's a class of, there's a class of, uh,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","3880000","3883000"," of aged people."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3883000","3886000"," That don't trust this at all."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3887000","3890000"," No matter what said, they want intervention."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3890000","3894000"," One of the reasons why Ackman is saying this is because."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3894000","3896000"," They want more than reassurance."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3896000","3898000"," They want an action."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3898000","3900000"," From the federal government."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3900000","3903000"," Uh, to dispel, to dispel the sphere."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3903000","3907000"," Unless you see that, and if you don't see that action from the government."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3907000","3912000"," I assure you that there will be no trust until something does break."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3912000","3915000"," Uh, most certainly."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3916000","3919000"," There will be zero, zero trust, none."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3919000","3922000"," Uh, out there, I'm going to assure you of that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3922000","3925000"," Now, some market breath indicator."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3925000","3930000"," Uh, real estate in the, in the shitter materials in the shitter."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3930000","3933000"," Um, finance financials in the shitter."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3933000","3937000"," Uh, if you want to buy financials, you're looking for an action."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3937000","3938000"," It'd be great trade."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3938000","3940000"," Uh, but you need to see that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3940000","3943000"," Otherwise it's, it's going to get paused."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3944000","3946000"," And wait and see."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3946000","3951000"," I don't, I don't think you see the rip face and rally in financials unless."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3951000","3956000"," There's some kind of, um, more than just reassurance from the, from the fed of the treasury department."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3956000","3958000"," I wouldn't trust the banks."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3958000","3959000"," How are you?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","3959000","3960000"," Or was me?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","3960000","3964000"," I can't say that for you. I can only tell you from my experience."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3964000","3966000"," Don't fucking trust them."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3966000","3970000"," Don't do not trust them at all. They will, they will lie to you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3971000","3977000"," Uh, yeah."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3977000","3982000"," You know, MBI is shaping up, but even though the MBI is shaping up, just, just on that MBI topic."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3982000","3985000"," Uh, you can see this last leg down right here, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","3985000","3987000"," You can see it right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3987000","3992000"," And you can see the MBI not even, not even on a low here at this point."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3992000","3997000"," And what's interesting is you see the rebuy over here and then we go right back down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3997000","3999000"," And that's what I'm expecting in the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","3999000","4002000"," I'm expecting some kind of a push higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4002000","4004000"," We had this beautiful bloodbath down here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4004000","4008000"," You get the buyers and then ban, they sell it right back down on you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4008000","4012000"," So if you see MBI spike, let's say right up in here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4012000","4016000"," Tell you to close and then we start to head lower to get that low."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4016000","4021000"," And you know, you got 3,600 down here, 3,500, 3,300 down here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4021000","4025000"," Uh, and there it is. You get it right into the end of the quarter."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4025000","4027000"," It might bleed into April."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4028000","4030000"," I don't trust it right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4030000","4031000"," I'm a bull."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4031000","4032000"," I'll be on it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4032000","4037000"," To me, the trade is to hedge on Monday high or Tuesday high."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4037000","4038000"," Hedge the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4039000","4040000"," That's a fucking lily."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4040000","4041000"," They're going to be hedged."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4041000","4042000"," You're going to see it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4042000","4044000"," Matter of fact, this is the crazy part."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4045000","4046000"," No matter what."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4047000","4048000"," No matter what we do."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4048000","4053000"," When we do it Monday, you're going to expect that hedging to come into the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4054000","4056000"," Now, could that propel us higher?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4056000","4057000"," Sure."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4057000","4061000"," If the market's super bearish up there, that could actually make us go higher, but, but"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4061000","4063000"," we'll be waiting to see what happens on Monday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4064000","4066000"," Uh, so MBI is not down where it can be."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4066000","4068000"," MBI can get even lower, believe it or not."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4068000","4071000"," We can get a spike up an MBI into Monday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4072000","4076000"," You can see like a spike up like this and then we're right back down to the gutters."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4076000","4078000"," Uh, heading into end of quarter."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4079000","4080000"," I wouldn't trust it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4081000","4085000"," Uh, if you wanted to buy some, if you wanted to buy some, some calls in the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4086000","4088000"," For tomorrow, it's probably not a bad idea."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4088080","4094280"," If you wanted to be long the market, you need to be above 400 and coming off of 400,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4094280","4095520"," consolidation of 400."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4096040","4100400"," And then we start moving higher to even jump into the market and think about it from"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4100400","4101120"," this perspective."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4102840","4104640"," I want you to think about this from this perspective."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4105280","4107120"," If, if the move is up, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4107600","4108400"," I want to show you this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4109480","4110640"," There's like a path, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4110680","4111640"," Market takes a path."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4112480","4114960"," We've got the, the soft landing, the hard landing."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4114960","4116200"," We'll make this really simple."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4121760","4125200"," Let's, let's call this the soft, soft to hard landing path."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4127360","4129000"," You know, a soft and hard landing path, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4130160","4131840"," Then you have a no landing path."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4134120","4135760"," There's the no landing path right there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4137520","4137800"," Right."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4138240","4141520"," If there's a, if, if we're, if we're going to get long in the smart, let's say you,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4141520","4143120"," let's just like breathe for a minute."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4144080","4152320"," If there's a no landing path, if there's a no landing path there, you're not,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4152320","4159120"," you're talking about coming all the way up here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4162920","4166400"," You know, you don't need this trade."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4167800","4169600"," You just need this trade over here somewhere."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4169600","4170480"," Does that make sense?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4174120","4176640"," Uh, you don't, you don't actually even need any of this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4177760","4179680"," You need some confirmation down here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4180800","4184080"," That we don't start selling, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4184080","4186480"," You need some, some new highs and stuff like that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4187360","4191360"," Uh, but why do you need to be the guy that's, I don't know why you need to be,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4191360","4192720"," like we bought this over here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4192720","4193360"," We bought this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4193360","4194160"," We bought this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4195120","4196080"," Uh, and I'll buy this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4196800","4197760"," What am I buying this?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4198560","4201200"," Uh, but I don't need to be the guy that is,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4201920","4205840"," but I don't think you as a retailer need to either capture the entire trade."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4205840","4206880"," You only need this much."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4208800","4211200"," If in June or July, we come back down here to test."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4211200","4212160"," This is for the bulls."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4212160","4215520"," Even if we come back in June or July and retest these lows,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4215520","4219200"," if you're trying to like call like the bottom or the top, this isn't the place."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4222160","4223040"," This isn't the place for you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4223040","4226080"," If anything, they're, they're setting you up right now for, uh,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4226080","4227200"," and they're going to do that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4227200","4230240"," My, my posit here since, uh, first of year was,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4231280","4236880"," even before first of year, I believe, but my posit here is that for this year,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4236880","4237920"," they're going to set up."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4237920","4238800"," This is the 20."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4238800","4239600"," This is the 31st."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4241040","4242320"," So you got the 31st."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4242320","4244000"," You've got, uh, here's June."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4245520","4245840"," Sorry."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4248080","4248640"," Hold on here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4251680","4252160"," Right there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4255280","4256240"," So my posit here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4256240","4257200"," Now price matters."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4258160","4259520"," Can you, can you buy?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4259520","4260000"," Can you buy?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4260080","4261680"," If you're a bull, can you buy these lows?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4261680","4262000"," Yes."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4263120","4263680"," Uh, you can."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4267920","4269600"," But you should be buying down here, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4270400","4271760"," At 345, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4271760","4273360"," You can buy 345."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4275200","4277040"," So you can DCA in here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4277040","4282400"," You can DCA in at 3300 or 2800 or wherever 33 or whatever price is over here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4282400","4285920"," You can buy all this stuff down here, but should you be buying right here?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4285920","4286400"," No."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4286400","4288320"," The next buy for bulls is above."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4289200","4290000"," It's over here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4291120","4294640"," And if there's ever a dump down, there's another buy for bulls down here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4295680","4299920"," But as far as a bull is concerned, is this a bottom?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4301040","4302320"," I would need more proof."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4303440","4307040"," I would need to, I would need to see this hold here and continue higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4307840","4310960"," But what I might be positive here though is that for this year,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4313360","4316000"," they're going to set up this leg every quarter on you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4316720","4319120"," They're going to set up this last leg down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4319120","4319920"," They're going to set it up."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4319920","4323760"," If we don't get it and we start trading this for the next quarter,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4323760","4327040"," they're going to set it up again for this next leg down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4327040","4329120"," If we don't get it, they're going to set it up again."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4329680","4330880"," And then you're going to get it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4330880","4332000"," They're going to set it up again."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4332000","4332320"," You see?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4332320","4336560"," So every time we set this up, this isn't the time for you to be."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4336560","4337920"," Yeah, I'm buying a fucking bottom here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4337920","4338800"," This isn't it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4338800","4344160"," This is the time for you to be watching from today into the end of quarter"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4344160","4347520"," and ensuring that you're not caught long in here or hedged"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4347520","4350320"," so that if we do go up, you get paid for that hedge."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4350320","4353200"," At least you're getting the trade paid for for you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4353200","4355040"," It's the most responsible thing that you can do."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4356320","4357440"," Put back spreads."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4357440","4359760"," One of the most responsible things here that you can do"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4360320","4363440"," at the end of each quarter or even the start of each quarter"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4363440","4368400"," or just have it on for the quarter because invariably,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4368400","4371360"," once one time this year, there's a very high probability"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4372320","4374240"," that we're going to be set up for that last leg down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4374240","4376800"," Whether it's here, whether it's there, whether it's here,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4376800","4383360"," whether it's in December for 2025, and be ready to buy one of these dips down here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4383920","4385520"," You can see it in the yield curve."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4385520","4387440"," You can see it in the unemployment rate."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4387440","4389520"," You can see it in the Fed funds rate."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4389520","4394240"," You can see it in inflation rate."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4394240","4397760"," As the inflation rate comes down, they're going to try to roll this market"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4398320","4399280"," and get a better price."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4400240","4402960"," Now, there's some out there that say we're never going to get this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4402960","4404160"," We're just going to continue higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4404160","4406000"," We're going to have no landing scenario."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4406000","4408400"," Now, if we get the no landing scenario, I'm open to it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4409360","4415440"," If you don't want to, if you think that the Estile calls is not the right trade for that,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4416000","4418080"," put back spreads, ratio spreads."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4418080","4419760"," They pay you if we continue higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4420560","4421200"," They're free."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4421920","4425280"," If we never make this leg down, it's the transition."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4425280","4426720"," We're at that transition point."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4427280","4431040"," So if you went on to add Captain's Alpha and you got yourself Estile calls,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4431760","4437680"," take the money and run, and then wait for a high and start putting on ratio spreads"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4437680","4439040"," to protect yourself."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4439040","4443520"," If you want to know where it was to buy, we already know that the buy was down below here in October."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4443520","4447920"," We know we had another one back here in June or July, and you're more than likely going to get one"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4448960","4452080"," at some point this year, more than likely."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4452080","4456320"," And if we don't get one of me grind higher here, that's the least of your worries."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4456720","4461920"," It's going to be catching this right here because in five years, three years, we're going to go on a bull run."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4462640","4467840"," Right now, when you look at the banks, it's there's some problems."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4469360","4473840"," If you start seeing tech workers not having paychecks and going on the unemployment line,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4473840","4478640"," you're going to see the unemployment numbers go up on a large scale."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4478640","4485360"," If you see deployed money not on the market, even more so not being deployed or even pulled back"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4485440","4493040"," out of the market or out of companies, it's going to get dangerous upcoming coming up this year."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4493040","4494960"," I assure you that we're in danger right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4500560","4504480"," It's not by the dip. If you're in a no landing situation, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4505680","4510480"," If you're in a no landing situation, you're going to have plenty of time,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4511440","4515040"," plenty of time to buy a dip even on this line."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4515040","4518560"," Let's say it's like December of 2024 and sentiment has changed."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4519120","4523440"," You hear like VC saying, whoa, we're going to start blowing or sending some money in the market or"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4524080","4529200"," you see your grandfathers out there dumping a couple million dollars in the stock market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4529200","4531840"," You're going to know, you're going to know when sentiment changes."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4531840","4537440"," Sentiment means something and you're going to have a run that last years and years and years and years."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4538080","4539440"," You're not going to get left behind."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4541120","4545520"," You aren't. But meanwhile, for this year, you can see it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4545520","4552160"," It's Claire's day. It's Claire's day right here that we are that they're ready."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4552160","4556400"," Are you ready as the question? Are you ready for a leg down?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4557200","4562240"," And if you're not ready for a leg down, they are. I assure you, they're ready for some"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4562240","4567280"," tails, not big time, but I would bet that I would bet that tomorrow any kind of squeeze."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4568160","4570400"," They're they're going to be right. You're going to see the tails."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4571440","4574080"," And America V VIX is all over that right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4582160","4585680"," Oh, yeah. So I didn't know that PayPal is pausing all crypto services,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4585680","4588720"," activities of 12 a.m. Pacific Standard Time."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4592240","4597200"," Yeah, I've got, um, I've got, you know, I wasn't"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4597360","4606480"," quite scared, but I've got some dirt cheap dirt cheap puts and until I can put a hedge on"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4606480","4614720"," for a ratio spread, I'm at like, I'm at like a violent move down at some point."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4614720","4619840"," I've gotten if we were to have a violent move down the next few days, I would not be shocked."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4621920","4624240"," I'm going to be honest with you. I wouldn't be shocked."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4628000","4629200"," And we can see them here, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4631280","4633280"," And see them right in here. Come back up, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4634400","4637440"," And then slam it down. Are you prepared for this?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4638240","4640480"," Is my question, I guess, if you're along this market, if"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4641520","4643600"," right here, are you prepared for a move like that?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4646800","4649280"," Uh, they're fast and violent."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4649280","4656800"," And how, how are beautiful this looks to you?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4656800","4657840"," I know this looks great."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4659440","4661920"," I get it. I get that this looks beautiful."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4666720","4669200"," Uh, but they're set up for it. They're ready to go."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4669200","4670160"," They're ready to rock and roll."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4670160","4673040"," So you get a green bar up on, uh, on Monday and"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4675120","4677360"," we don't have, is that working for me or no?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4677360","4678240"," I don't know if that's working."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4678960","4680800"," Get this nice green bar up on Monday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4680800","4683200"," Failure to close and it's, it's raining."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4683760","4685440"," It's raining, man. How will, how will you?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4690080","4691360"," That's what you don't want to see."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4691360","4692320"," I think that's the fear."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4694160","4696080"," Uh, and it's, it's one more place."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4696080","4697920"," I, I can assure you that right up here,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4697920","4701600"," 397, uh, 3972, three, four."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4702160","4703440"," Sellers are going to be stepping in."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4704400","4705200"," They're, they're waiting."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4708720","4711920"," Yeah, credit Swiss, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4712640","4714640"," You got credit Swiss in the Bank of Japan."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4716160","4717280"," Is that your tsunami?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4719760","4721840"," Hold on here. I got to read something in a text message."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4724720","4727680"," They get, they get some, some, some, some news coming out maybe."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4731120","4734720"," Uh, so FDIC auction for SVB said to be underway."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4734720","4736000"," Final bids do Sunday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4736720","4740960"," The FDIC kicked off an auction process late Saturday night for Silicon Valley Bank."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4741680","4744640"," This is from a black box from a Bloomberg terminal."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4745760","4748560"," Uh, with final bids due on Sunday afternoon,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4748560","4749920"," according to people familiar with the matter,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4749920","4752000"," the FDIC is aiming for a swift deal,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4752000","4754240"," but a winner may not be known until late Sunday,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4754240","4758400"," according to one person who asked not to be identified because the matter isn't public."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4759040","4763200"," No final decision has been made and it's possible that no deal may be reached."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4763680","4768880"," Said the people representatives for the FDIC didn't immediately respond to requests"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4768880","4771760"," for comments outside of regular business hours."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4772560","4775920"," Um, so that is from a Bloomberg terminal."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4775920","4777200"," I'll read that to you one more time."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4778160","4782640"," The FDIC kicked off an auction process late Saturday night for SVB"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4783440","4785840"," with final bids due by Sunday afternoon,"

"AkmLYEibZH0","4802000","4802640"," Said the people."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4803840","4808000"," That should be, that should be a catalyst heading into,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4808000","4811520"," that should be a catalyst heading into futures overnight."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4811520","4813760"," If that deal is reached, I don't know if I'd be short overnight,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4813760","4815760"," because if that deal does get reached overnight,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4815760","4818400"," you'd probably see a rip, a face ripper at some point."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4820000","4832960"," Uh, on yields, you know, yields can roll over and the market won't roll over."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4834640","4840240"," I see yields rolling over and I don't know how that impacts the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4841280","4843360"," The market doesn't always react immediately to that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4850000","4859360"," You can read what you guys are saying in the, uh,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4867280","4868240"," Hey, sloth, how are you?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4873040","4874960"," I think a lot of this is going to impact up."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4874960","4878400"," I think a lot of this with SVP, if SVP is able to be bought"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4878400","4885680"," by a financial, a large financial institution and restructuring, uh, repayment, believe it or not,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4886400","4893840"," repayment of all of most of this money, not 30 to 50%, but let's say the thing gets 75% of that money,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4894560","4900080"," it would at least, um, it would at least say that the Fed is there to support banks."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4901360","4904400"," If they don't, if that does not happen, if a deal is not reached,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4905040","4909040"," I would, I'd be fearful, that's the fucking looly."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4910000","4911760"," It says that the Fed put is not there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4917840","4919120"," Yeah, so let's go back real quick."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4922880","4925120"," Let's go back real quick just to wrap up the show here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4928320","4930160"," So you guys can take just a quick snap of this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4935280","4939200"," And to tomorrow, this is where the sellers are."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4939200","4943920"," Swellers, they're sellers, uh, $3.99 78."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4946080","4947760"," Expect volatility up on high here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4948560","4954160"," And these will also be catalysts for move higher for squeezes higher, uh, unless you're above three,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4954160","4961280"," unless you regain and hold, you'd be looking for, uh, you can just get rid of all that S through"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4961280","4964160"," two S three stuff up there. This doesn't really matter, but you're really,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4964160","4966160"," it really matters to bear."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4966160","4975040"," Bulls up here is that move higher and then a holding of this, uh, to allow these, uh,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4976240","4981440"," triggers to come up and, and velocity to come up from underneath, stabilize the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4981440","4983920"," If we can't stabilize above 400, it's sell the rep."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4985520","4989280"," Sure, you that bears right now are up here just waiting to come down,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","4989280","4991280"," rain, rain, hell upon you in the end of month."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4993680","4998160"," Uh, don't, don't look at the R ones and S ones and S two as they change for, for Monday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","4999280","5002000"," Pivots will change, but this stuff is all accurate right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5003600","5005600"," Where if I go, just get rid of it, we'll get rid of this now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5007440","5008480"," You can't even see it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5015440","5017680"," On the downside, if we don't get a deal,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5019680","5026080"," for bears, uh, they want to get underneath three 74, three 75, 18, uh, no deal."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5026080","5032960"," We start grinding down anything like this, grind, grind, grind, bad CPI report, um, heading"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5032960","5034640"," into FOMC."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5035440","5043680"," Uh, if we get bad news on the, this would be the dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5043680","5049200"," dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot,"

"AkmLYEibZH0","5055040","5057280"," Bears looking for a little bit of inspiration here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5058240","5064240"," You would get a grind down and uh, bears need to be underneath this three."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5064240","5070880"," 375 22, they can get underneath 375 50 BPS rate hike."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5070880","5074960"," And we're heading, we're heading even lower we're gonna head down to October lows."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5074960","5082600"," and we hit the october lows if we get some more bad news you start getting"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5082600","5087600"," some some cracking and breaking around the economy. Bank of Japan, credit"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5087600","5091440"," Swiss, any of that stuff you're looking for. If the dirty laundry starts getting"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5091440","5097400"," aired out we break below the october lows that's where heading down to 3300."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5097520","5104960"," I need one. I need a fine trade that almost always works without it. I can't"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5104960","5112280"," come playing in the casino. For me it's always the market breadth indicator"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5112280","5120120"," with spreads always with time on them too. But currently right now there's no"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5120120","5124880"," trade for me right now. For me right now if you want the trade for right now"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5124880","5130880"," it's a ratio spread on a high tomorrow. And I'll come on an hour early tomorrow"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5130880","5134120"," and you'll I'll give you the ratio spread. Well we'll look at the ratio spread and"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5134120","5138120"," then we'll set it up so that once we come up into these highs it's you got a"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5138120","5143360"," better understanding of it once we're up there and we'll do it on stream so that"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5143360","5148280"," you can actually see how it pays. So it pays actually pays you a little extra"

"AkmLYEibZH0","5154280","5164600"," it'll pay you hundreds and hundreds of percent. I don't think that there is but"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5164600","5170080"," if you if you run the ratio spread and run a low it's not really the best trade"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5170080","5173320"," to take. You want to take it on a high."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5175280","5179800"," Yeah there is there's there's high risk on another leg down absolutely absolutely"

"AkmLYEibZH0","5215320","5219040"," Let me let me mute a couple things here and show you guys."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5223520","5224800"," We'll show you guys a couple things here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5225800","5228800"," Go on here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5231800","5235800"," Leave this is yeah get rid of that there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5238800","5242800"," I want to show you guys one."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5242800","5248800"," Okay let's talk about I'm losing my ass in this market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5248800","5256800"," I'm going to leave you with two things."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5260800","5264800"," It's fairly simple."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5268800","5272800"," Most people are getting caught up in this market"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5273800","5277800"," when they try to time the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5277800","5281800"," I'd be like why didn't I miss that you know like oh cap I should have been that"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5281800","5285800"," old cap I should have been that the reality was it was this it was this retest"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5285800","5290800"," down here. This is these are called the meat of the trades right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5290800","5295800"," Right take that part of the trade you want some confirmation of trend."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5295800","5297800"," Same thing down here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5297800","5301800"," Now we have the benefit of seeing this after it's happened right."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5301800","5304800"," But even so on the down move here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5304800","5308800"," Oftentimes people will say well I should have taken that down move there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5308800","5311800"," People get bummed out there like oh man."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5311800","5314800"," Like you didn't call the top."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5314800","5319800"," Or they think that social media is telling them."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5319800","5323800"," Oh that guy called the top I'll tell you this that guy in social media more than"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5323800","5325800"," likely has been calling the top every week."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5325800","5329800"," He probably called the top Harry probably called the top Harry probably called the top here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5329800","5333800"," The truth is even if you missed that initial move down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5333800","5336800"," There's usually a confirmation trade higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5336800","5338800"," And the meat of the trade is after."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5338800","5340800"," There's a meat of the trade."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5340800","5341800"," There's a meat of the trade."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5341800","5344800"," And this is where the money was right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5344800","5346800"," This is where the safe money was."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5346800","5348800"," This is where the safe money was."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5348800","5351800"," And so oftentimes you don't see that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5351800","5355800"," You don't see where the real money is made this market when you have confirmation of"
"AkmLYEibZH0","5355800","5358800"," trend on an hourly and daily trigger."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5358800","5362800"," So we have this initial move down here in the market right."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5362800","5365800"," So just currently let's look at the market right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5365800","5368800"," You can see this move down confirmation trade."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5368800","5370800"," The leg was lower right."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5370800","5371800"," Beautiful trade right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5371800","5373800"," A bunch of money made in safety."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5373800","5376800"," And the same idea comes into play here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5376800","5380800"," If it confirms that we're rejecting here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5380800","5382800"," This is where the meat believe it or not."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5382800","5383800"," This is not the meat of the trade."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5383800","5385800"," This whole part here is bullshit."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5385800","5388800"," The real meat of the trade is actually this move here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5388800","5392800"," This is where the money is in this trade."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5392800","5395800"," And coming in tomorrow we're coming into that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5395800","5398800"," We will know in the next day or two."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5398800","5400800"," If the confirmed move is down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5400800","5402800"," Just off these two lines right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5402800","5404800"," We're going to know."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5404800","5407800"," And if this if this is sold."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5407800","5410800"," The move is going to be down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5410800","5412800"," Assuredly."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5413800","5415800"," The move is going to be going to be down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5415800","5419800"," So this will be the confirmation for bears for a large leg down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5419800","5420800"," And we'll know it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5420800","5421800"," We'll come right into it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5421800","5422800"," You'll see it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5422800","5426800"," You're going to probably see us come up here and you'll see sellers step right in."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5426800","5431800"," So how do you take that trade to be for safety is you put the put put back for spread on."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5431800","5434800"," Or you could even just put a."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5434800","5436800"," Put."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5437800","5444800"," Put spreads credit puts bread something like that with stops above if we break above."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5444800","5447800"," But the juice of this trade hasn't even started yet."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5447800","5449800"," For the bears at least."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5449800","5452800"," I know that you think that it has but it hasn't."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5452800","5454800"," The juice of this trade is up here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5454800","5457800"," If you get that confirmation as a bear."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5457800","5458800"," It's going to be nasty."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5458800","5459800"," And it's going to."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5459800","5460800"," And you can sit down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5460800","5463800"," You can just sit back and watch a print."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5464800","5466800"," There's no you don't have no worries there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5466800","5468800"," It's confirming another leg lower."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5470800","5471800"," And the same thing goes right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5471800","5472800"," You can actually see it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5472800","5474800"," Where it failed."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5477800","5481800"," Here bears thought that we were going to go down in December."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5481800","5482800"," Right."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5482800","5485800"," Remember bears are calling for a down move right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5485800","5488800"," And you can actually see the daily curling up."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5488800","5489800"," Right."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5489800","5491800"," Or slowing down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5492800","5494800"," But even so."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5494800","5497800"," If you had had puts on right here you would have known."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5497800","5499800"," To have had stops here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5499800","5502800"," And not get gotten completely blown out."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5502800","5505800"," And the crazy part was you could have recovered your money."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5505800","5507800"," On this retest right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5507800","5510800"," Successful retest you knew we were going higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5510800","5514800"," So just just just in this chart right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5514800","5516800"," We're bearish."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5516800","5518800"," I want you to know that we're fucking bearish."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5518800","5519800"," Not only fucking bearish."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5520800","5522800"," We're looking to sell any reps right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5524800","5529800"," So on a high you're going to be putting on some kind of a ratio spread some kind of market hedge."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5529800","5531800"," And if it goes against you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5531800","5535800"," And we trade higher than the early and daily trigger."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5535800","5537800"," And we start and we reject off of it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5537800","5538800"," If so."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5538800","5539800"," So let's say."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5544800","5545800"," This is the move here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5545800","5547800"," A higher let's say."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5547800","5550800"," And you put on your your heads right."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5550800","5555800"," If price continues higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5555800","5556800"," Right."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5556800","5557800"," It will."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5557800","5560800"," Come back down believe it or not."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5560800","5565800"," And retest for confirmation."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5565800","5567800"," Let me see if I can."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5568800","5572800"," The price comes up."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5586800","5588800"," You put a hedge in the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5589800","5598800"," And if you blast right through your your head you're like oh shit."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5598800","5601800"," Well if you've got a ratio spread you're getting paid."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5601800","5603800"," If you're in put spreads."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5603800","5607800"," And you're like oh Jesus I got blown out of that trade."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5607800","5611800"," Even for bulls they're going to want to see."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5611800","5613800"," The confirmation and hold."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5613800","5616800"," It'll probably give you at least one opportunity."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5617800","5621800"," To unfuck your your put spreads."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5621800","5622800"," Right."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5622800","5626800"," So you're like okay now I'm out of put spreads are out of esta triple leverage calls."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5626800","5630800"," And bulls won their their rejection trade we're going higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5630800","5633800"," So you're you have the chance to unfuck yourself out of that trade."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5633800","5637800"," And you're able to take a long knowing that we've confirmed."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5637800","5638800"," To move higher for bulls."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5638800","5640800"," And I want you to just think about this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5640800","5643800"," You're telling me we're going all time highs right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5643800","5645800"," The only way you're telling me we're going all time highs."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5646800","5649800"," Is it the Fed steps in."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5649800","5654800"," You need the fed to step in you to fed to say we're going to make everything right with these with this bank."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5654800","5659800"," We're going to backstop everything in crypto and we're going to pause rates."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5659800","5664800"," Or we're only doing 25 VPS."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5664800","5667800"," And even then I think we're going down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5667800","5669800"," Me personally I think we are."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5669800","5672800"," I think they're going to try to find a low in the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5672800","5676800"," And wash everybody out and start fresh."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5676800","5680800"," I don't even think that's bull to me it's not bullish."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5680800","5682800"," The bulls have a lot of shit to do man."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5682800","5685800"," They do have a lot of work to do."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5685800","5687800"," They need a full sentiment change."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5703800","5713800"," I can show it to you every time I can literally show you every time it retraces."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5713800","5716800"," It might take a week a month but it fucking retraces."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5716800","5718800"," If you're hedging the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5718800","5722800"," If you like got a three or six month hedge in the market you probably have."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5722800","5724800"," Even if we're going up you probably have."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5724800","5726800"," I just put it to the side."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5726800","5729800"," And in the next week or two month or two."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5729800","5731800"," We'll be right back down there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5731800","5736800"," That's the moment for you to reposition yourself and take the trade long."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5736800","5737800"," Right."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5737800","5738800"," Well that's happening."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5738800","5741800"," So if you're buying let's say we're let's say we're the top tomorrow right right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5741800","5743800"," You're in top you put your ratio spread on."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5743800","5745800"," And we start going higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5745800","5748800"," You take the trade higher while staying in the ratio spread."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5748800","5752800"," If you're getting blown out on your put your put spread for June."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5752800","5757800"," You take the trade higher and wait for us to come back down for you to go."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5757800","5758800"," Fuck it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5758800","5760800"," I got to reposition reposition this trade."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5761800","5763800"," Right put better time on it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5763800","5765800"," Put a bit of price on it any of that kind of stuff."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5765800","5768800"," And meanwhile even making money on the upside."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5770800","5771800"," Right."

"AkmLYEibZH0","5807800","5809800"," I want to wrap this up at this point."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5809800","5812800"," I apologize any that I haven't called over the weekend."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5813800","5815800"," I've been trying not to talk."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5816800","5821800"," And I'm afraid that if I chat with you on DM or text message that I'm going to call you."

"AkmLYEibZH0","5833800","5835800"," I think I'm going to leave you with that today."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5835800","5836800"," So tomorrow."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5836800","5837800"," So there's a couple of things."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5837800","5838800"," Some key points for tomorrow."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5839800","5844800"," You're looking for any kind of a deal tonight with SVB reassurance from the Fed."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5845800","5849800"," It's going to be taken in a positive light. I don't know where futures open."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5849800","5852800"," I'm going to assume that futures are going to be."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5853800","5854800"," Up or sideways."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5855800","5857800"," And waiting for that news to arrive."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5859800","5862800"," Even if that news even if it even if it's just pause."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5862800","5865800"," I still think we get a retracement rally."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5866800","5867800"," Tomorrow."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5867800","5869800"," I think it comes tomorrow."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5870800","5872800"," Even so."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5873800","5875800"," The way price action is right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5875800","5878800"," I think they're going to try to sell the fuck out of 400."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5879800","5882800"," And I would be prepared for it. And even if we go higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5882800","5885800"," You're still going to expect sellers to come in there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5886800","5887800"," Right. So."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5888800","5890800"," Even if the trade is higher from 400."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5891800","5893800"," You're going to expect auto sellers coming in 100%."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5894800","5899800"," And there are two places for you to look for this on the spy for tomorrow."

"AkmLYEibZH0","5920800","5921800"," This is SPX."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5922800","5923800"," For rejection."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5925800","5927800"," If you get above the hourly."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5927800","5928800"," You get above."

"AkmLYEibZH0","5930800","5931800"," So tomorrow."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5931800","5935800"," I'll be looking for a trade higher to 39 25 52."

"AkmLYEibZH0","5966800","5968800"," Oh man."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5969800","5970800"," This is my guy."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5970800","5973800"," Captain's Alpha chart that was from like February 2nd or some."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5973800","5974800"," Okay."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5974800","5975800"," So for ES."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5979800","5980800"," Oh man."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5981800","5982800"," Yes."

"AkmLYEibZH0","5992800","5994800"," I'm watching text messages right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5994800","5995800"," They're funny as fuck."
"AkmLYEibZH0","5997800","6003800"," Yes, you're looking for a cell at 39 35.50."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6003800","6008800"," If it holds 39 39 3550."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6008800","6010800"," You're going to look for a trade higher to."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6012800","6013800"," 40 11 75."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6013800","6015800"," This is the continuous contract."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6019800","6020800"," And then on spy."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6020800","6023800"," You guys come back and look at this video on YouTube."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6024800","6028800"," On spy are looking for a trade to 39 160."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6028800","6029800"," Probably slightly low."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6029800","6032800"," It's probably to 39 101."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6032800","6034800"," If they can hold that number."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6034800","6036800"," You look for a trade higher to."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6037800","6040800"," 39 9 30 39 9 78."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6041800","6043800"," Somewhere up in there when I give you these numbers."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6043800","6047800"," I want you to know that we're going to come into volatility before we hit them."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6047800","6051800"," You're going to see the market slow as we as we as we trade up there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6051800","6053800"," If you're a bear."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6054800","6057800"," I gave you the numbers earlier on."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6058800","6061800"," On the weevil charts."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6061800","6063800"," If you see any failure above here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6064800","6065800"," See this failure."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6065800","6066800"," It's going to be a grind."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6066800","6068800"," It's the same as that late February."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6068800","6073800"," Grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6073800","6077800"," And then wait for that vault that volatility."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6078800","6080800"," Wait for 50 bps."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6081800","6083800"," From the smack this market down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6084800","6087800"," Oh, yeah, Hofstadter."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6087800","6088800"," Send me a DM."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6088800","6090800"," And I'll get you my phone number."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6090800","6091800"," Give me a shout."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6091800","6093800"," If you're if you're still in the stream right now, give me a shot in DM."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6093800","6095800"," You know, if you're going to lose."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6095800","6097800"," This isn't a Hofstadter either."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6098800","6100800"," This is the any of you out there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6100800","6104800"," This is this is a someone want to talk to any any of you out there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6104800","6106800"," I don't care if you're a bull or a bear."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6106800","6108800"," As a retail trader."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6108800","6110800"," This has been."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6110800","6114160"," If you're going to lose, this isn't a Hofstadter either."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6114160","6115600"," This is to any of you out there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6118480","6122640"," This is something I want to talk to any of you out there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6122640","6126720"," I don't care if you're a bull or a bear, as a retail trader."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6126720","6137200"," This has been this year, not 2023, but 2022,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6137200","6139120"," especially the second half of it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6140640","6145120"," In hindsight, it looks great, but it hasn't been great."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6145120","6146880"," There's no liquidity in the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6152160","6156160"," If you can get through this, the one thing I'm going to tell you is this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6156160","6163120"," If you can get through this, whether it's now or into the end of next year,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6164080","6167200"," in this means if you have to withdraw your money from the market,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6167200","6169440"," this means that you just say, I'm not going to trade right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6170880","6172640"," Maybe just follow along in this market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6173840","6179200"," If you cannot get shaken out of this market in the coming year,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6180720","6183600"," and just wait for the markets to not be as volatile,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6185600","6189760"," it's going to immensely change"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6194000","6205120"," It's going to be something, an experience that new investors and traders don't have."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6208160","6211680"," I don't know how long you've been trading, and Hofstra says it's been here 20 years."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6212880","6220720"," The past, I want to say it started in 18, 2018, maybe 2019."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6221600","6224240"," It got tough or tougher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6224880","6226640"," There were great periods, of course."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6229440","6231200"," But I think this is the normalized."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6231200","6233840"," I think we're trying to get to some kind of normalization of markets"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6234480","6236000"," for the hope that we get there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6236000","6237840"," I don't know if we ever get there ever again, but"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6239680","6242400"," at least if you're looking for stability in the markets to be"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6243360","6247680"," trade-and-safely, it's always in a bull market, even if you're a bear."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6248240","6251280"," There's stability in trading,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6252240","6255040"," sell side by side, there's stability in a bull market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6255040","6257440"," So if you're getting cut up right now or beat up right now,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6258880","6260800"," I've had some of the toughest goers of your career right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6261520","6263040"," These are not fun times."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6263760","6267760"," And the liquidity in the market is one of the key drivers of that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6267760","6271840"," Your mistakes become more glaring when there's no liquidity in the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6271840","6276240"," When there is liquidity in the market, your mistakes are already in the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6276400","6279600"," Your mistakes are helped and glossed over."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6281680","6284560"," So you just have to make it through this cycle here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6286000","6286800"," It's a bad one."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6296080","6297200"," It's a great time to do it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6298800","6299440"," Hands down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6301280","6303600"," There's only one other thing I would posit on this would be"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6304240","6307040"," that oftentimes traders that trade through these environments,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6308400","6313520"," they miss big runs when they actually do happen because you become very jaded."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6315280","6316720"," You don't believe things, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6317680","6321280"," So you'd have to be aware of that too, that that could affect you in the future."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6325760","6326880"," But give me a shout."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6326880","6329920"," I'll DM you my phone number and we'll talk."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6331760","6332880"," It's not an easy market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6332880","6333520"," I'll show you that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6335440","6337680"," Hofstadter, I'm telling you, man, we're bearish right now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6339520","6341360"," We're in a bearish stance, 100%."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6342400","6343760"," I need you to know that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6343760","6347360"," If you're a bull out there, I need you to know that we're in a bearish stance."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6347360","6354640"," I don't give a fuck if we go up to 400 on the opening fucking bell tomorrow."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6355680","6356400"," Still bearish."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6360480","6362720"," You need to trade above it and then you need to hold it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6362720","6364560"," And then you need to consolidate it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6364560","6367600"," And then you need to take off from it, even get bullish."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6369120","6370320"," You need to retest it, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6371040","6374400"," So if we take, let's say this is the deal."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6374400","6379360"," So just in a one month, we're sitting in a one hour chart."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6384880","6387600"," So you're a bull, right?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6390080","6391040"," You're not bullish."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6391920","6394480"," If we trade up here, you're not bullish."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6394480","6397680"," Believe it or not, I know you think you are, but you're not."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6398240","6405440"," You literally need to retest that 400 and then make your your way higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6407360","6409040"," This is where it gets bullish right there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6410320","6413680"," Now, this isn't the timeframe, but I'm saying to you, like over time,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6413680","6417040"," this is a week or a month, you're still not fucking bullish."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6421920","6423040"," Not bullish."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6423040","6424080"," I mean, you can take this trade."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6424080","6425360"," This is where people get cut up."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6425360","6430000"," You want that trade higher confirmation and then we're moving higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6430640","6434640"," And bears, if they make this trade higher, they're going to short here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6435760","6438320"," And then it comes up and over and retest and successful."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6438320","6439760"," They're going to cut loose and go long."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6442400","6443520"," So what else to say to you?"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6444480","6447360"," If you're taking longs here and you're not hedging yourself,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6447360","6448560"," I don't know what to say to you either."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6448560","6450240"," I mean, it's a hard thing to say there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6450240","6453680"," Like put back spreads are fucking free, man."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6453680","6454160"," They're free."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6455760","6458400"," And there's an opportunity hopefully coming for it tomorrow."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6458400","6462720"," Hopefully tomorrow or tonight or tomorrow, there's an opportunity to actually put one on right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6465920","6469280"," And if we start trading higher, they'll even pay for themselves."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6470000","6473680"," If they trade higher up here, they'll pay for themselves."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6474800","6479360"," Then you can sell out of those and put new ones on for a move lower down here later on."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6480080","6483680"," So you got to be hedged at some point."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6486160","6487680"," And we're going to be trading five minute here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6487680","6492480"," So if you're looking at a five minute, this is just in this chart right here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6492480","6496400"," If you're looking at a five minute trade, we're going to slow down the broadcast."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6497440","6499840"," And you can actually see when we're trading underneath these levels here,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6499840","6502000"," we're bears, we trade above them, we're bullish."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6502880","6503600"," So we're looking at it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6503600","6507680"," This is a one hour, but if we're in a one hour, we're going to start cycling through the one hour"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6508160","6512720"," and the 15 minute and then the into the five minute so that we know when we're bullish,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6512720","6513280"," we're bearish."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6513920","6515360"," You can see we're bearish below here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6516000","6521040"," You can even see on Friday, we had the last year on Friday and we rejected above."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6521040","6522320"," And we started selling this down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6522320","6527760"," We called it to the pin and then we're going to be looking for the trade above"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6527760","6530720"," into Monday as long as we stay above these numbers on Monday,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6530720","6533520"," we'll take a long call and we'll put some time on it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6534160","6536560"," You know, make it a weekly or monthly or a spread."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6538160","6540720"," And so you can make your 10, 20, 30 percent."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6540720","6543280"," And then once we come back to roll over and retest those things,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6544160","6545840"," so we're going to slow down the broadcast."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6547440","6551760"," We're going to slow down how you guys are making money."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6552960","6556320"," Mostly, most of the most of the reason is because I'm like, man,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6557040","6559280"," we were trying to talk about a four second delay."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6559280","6562160"," And I was like, I'm buying a call for 10 cents."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6562160","6563440"," Let's say I buy a call for 10 cents."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6564000","6565280"," So I buy it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6565280","6566000"," It fills."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6566560","6568720"," I tell you, then I tell you, hey, I just bought a call."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6570320","6571920"," Four seconds later, you hear it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6572720","6575840"," Then you go to look for that call, then you go try to buy that call."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6575840","6577760"," And then you actually get it to execute."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6577760","6579920"," That could be like 15 to 30 seconds."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6581120","6583680"," We could be in a rip in a one minute chart and coming back down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6583680","6586480"," You could be buying a 30 cent call, comes back down to 10 cents."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6587200","6589040"," You're upside down on the next rip higher."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6589040","6590080"," I'm already out of the call."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6590080","6594240"," And I know that some of you do that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6594240","6596240"," So not all of you, but I know some of you do it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6596240","6601040"," So if I slow it down a five minute, I can say we're bullish"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6602000","6604800"," for the next 30 minutes, hour, three days."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6604800","6605760"," I can give you a time frame."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6605760","6609360"," I can say next 15 minutes, next 30 minutes, next two hours,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6610080","6614480"," on an hourly, next few days, we're bullish."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6615920","6618800"," And we're going to do bigger time frames week out, month out."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6619760","6621040"," Just to slow it down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6621920","6623520"," We'll keep revisiting the one minute."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6623520","6625760"," It's for any one of you out there that are trading one minute charts."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6626640","6629200"," But for at least the stream, it just can't."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6629200","6630720"," It can't do it anymore."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6630720","6631360"," It can't."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6631360","6632240"," There's no reason."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6632240","6632960"," I'll be honest with you."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6632960","6634320"," There's no reason for you to get cut up."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6635440","6636240"," There really isn't."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6637840","6640320"," So we're going to start trading higher time frame charts."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6640960","6644560"," I'm going to start looking at higher time frames so you can see how long you can be like this,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6644560","6648560"," or where you pull the plug on it, or where you add another side."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6649040","6652400"," That trade, you can actually be long in short this market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6653520","6658080"," So you can if you're in longs, we're in a higher time frame and we roll over something,"
"AkmLYEibZH0","6658720","6662560"," we can show you how to take a put spread to cancel that out, that trade out."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6663520","6668000"," Or some puts that are weaker a month out that can pay for the price of that trade."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6672080","6673680"," You can DM me on social media."
"AkmLYEibZH0","6673680","6676080"," I'm on a bunch of ways for you to contact me."

"AkmLYEibZH0","6730400","6732960"," I would recommend that you stop fucking trading real money."

"AkmLYEibZH0","6846880","6851360"," Mistakes are easily forgiven in the market."

"AkmLYEibZH0","7043600","7045200"," You buy yourself a hundred pack of a ticker"

"AkmLYEibZH0","7056080","7057840"," I was probably a trade here for zero day traders."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7058720","7059280"," To hold for."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7059920","7060720"," Thirty seconds."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7060720","7061840"," Fifteen minutes."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7061840","7062480"," Five minutes."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7063360","7063840"," One minute."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7063840","7064560"," That kind of stuff."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7065680","7067680"," There'll still be some of that here for you too as well."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7070400","7071040"," Really you guys."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7071600","7073280"," Well you guys are saying all kinds of stuff."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7073280","7074560"," Have a great day everybody out there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7075920","7082160"," No no I know so Cosmo not project is correct."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7082160","7083520"," Cap is always late."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7084720","7086800"," I'm trying my best right now to."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7088320","7090720"," To the program is changing."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7090720","7091920"," I assure you of that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7093680","7096560"," Right now it's hard for me to get or it has been hard for me to get here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7096560","7097520"," Like even nine thirty."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7098320","7099920"," But with the formatting change."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7100960","7102480"," Not so hard much easier."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7103360","7105680"," Uh so I'll be here eight thirty tomorrow morning."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7105680","7107200"," I hope unless I do the production."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7108240","7108960"," Here you are right."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7109760","7111520"," I think I have to get up at like six thirty now."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7112720","7114320"," The only other thing I'd say on that is."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7115520","7116960"," If we start early at eight thirty."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7117440","7119360"," I may not be here at four every day."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7121280","7122800"," Depending where the market's going."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7122800","7123200"," If we're."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7123600","7125680"," If the market starts to begin to trade sideways."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7126560","7127600"," Key point in this is."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7127600","7129280"," I think what it does is."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7130000","7131840"," If we're trading sideways."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7132640","7134160"," I don't think I need a live stream in those days."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7134160","7136560"," We're not not live stream but we'll set up some trades."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7137120","7140240"," Look around the market and wait until the market makes a decision where it's going."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7140240","7142240"," And then I'll come back on the live stream."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7143520","7146560"," So I think it's like the same hours but less hours."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7149680","7151120"," I love you too Cosmo."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7152080","7153120"," I know I agree with that."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7153120","7155120"," 100% I don't disagree with that at all."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7155760","7157520"," I know I agree with that 100%."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7157520","7158960"," I don't disagree with that at all."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7158960","7160320"," Yeah so eight thirty tomorrow morning."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7162080","7164320"," I think on the days where I think that I think the key."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7164320","7165760"," I think the key thing here is this."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7167360","7169600"," We're going to focus on trend days up or down."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7170160","7171360"," So if we're trending."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7171360","7172160"," I'm fucking here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7172720","7174000"," If we start to consolidate."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7174560","7176720"," We're going to chart out the market."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7177360","7178720"," And then I'm going to say no trade."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7180880","7182960"," And I'll be back live streaming the moment."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7183040","7186560"," I'll be like hey look I'll be back tomorrow normal time in the morning eight thirty."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7187440","7188800"," And then if we get a move."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7189840","7192480"," Any moment let's say we get a move like two thirty in the afternoon."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7192480","7193680"," I'll fucking come right back on."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7194240","7196880"," And we'll start talking about post something on Twitter."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7196880","7200560"," Some say hey look we're finding a trend finally."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7200560","7202720"," And we'll come back on and take it from there."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7204160","7205360"," I think a lot of you lose the money."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7205360","7207280"," I think most of you just want to make money."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7208000","7209360"," I think that's the key driver here."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7210320","7216240"," And we can probably shorten those broadcasts and say if we trade above this number and confirm it."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7216960","7220560"," That we can jump in back into the market and take it long or short either way."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7223520","7225280"," Yeah so you guys all have a great afternoon."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7225920","7227440"," Spent up for the rest of your Sunday."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7228080","7230320"," Hopefully drinking bears and barbecue and if you're in the south."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7230880","7232560"," If you're in the north you're totally fucked."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7235520","7237840"," But I'll catch up with you guys tomorrow."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7239600","7244880"," All right I'll see you guys tomorrow."
"AkmLYEibZH0","7244880","7245680"," Later."
