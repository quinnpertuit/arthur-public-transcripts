"26840","31490"," Yeah, baby, back out of one more day."
"32150","33090"," Good morning, Chaz."
"33370","33590"," How are you?"
"34490","35270"," Morning Joshua?"
"36150","37130"," Morning Jake, you?"
"37650","38730"," Where we roamed?"
"38870","39110"," Good morning. "
"40010","40570"," Teagan, good morning."
"41230","41970"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"42650","43750"," You guys all hanging in out there?"
"46190","48050"," Morning D.O., morning fisted."
"49630","54590"," Yeah, I've got hopefully I got some coffee, I asked for some coffee, but hopefully I can get a"
"54590","59850"," couple of my throat's a little sore too, so I hope I'll talk about that later. "
"60450","63390"," Good morning Lofi, or Lofi."
"65170","66270"," Morning fazed on."
"70070","72510"," How's that Spidey senses out there Teagan?"
"73630","74830"," I said old crispy"
"74830","86570"," old"
"86570","90470"," man I hope you all closed your calls last night. "
"91290","95390"," I hope we're saving some of you some money out there."
"97750","105930"," Morning Desperado, blind nest owl, BTCCK, Ryan Mihai, where we roamed, and this is the end of"
"105930","108430"," season we trust, Chantu, and Billie S."
"108650","113850"," Bugcat, boy I'm on Twitter and I'm looking around and I'm like man, Twitter is getting slow these"
"113850","117050"," days, especially Fintuit, weeding them out left and right."
"118550","121630"," Trying to find out who's gonna make it through all this shit show, right?"
"122210","122610"," Billie S."
"122850","126330"," Bugcat, Bagholder, Ace Man, Samuel, Binky, good morning. "
"128009","130810"," Shit's gonna hit the fan, huh?"
"131650","133510"," Jason, my brother, good to see you."
"134770","135170"," HP."
"138090","141730"," All right, so we are going to switch over. "
"141730","142670"," We got a lot to talk about this morning."
"142790","147830"," I did, I was watching, if I was reading, trying to keep up on discord this morning, someone had a"
"147830","153290"," great question and they asked about Flow Algo and you know it's a great question."
"159650","163910"," We're gonna quickly talk about Flow Algo, okay?"
"164730","169510"," And the reason that I like Flow Algo is because when I'm on some other flow sites, I'm not"
"169510","171590"," affiliated at all with Flow Algo. "
"172350","177330"," You guys don't have to buy it, it's expensive, whatever you use that works for you, stay with it."
"177770","180750"," The reason I use it on the question that was asked was, what is he using?"
"180970","188350"," It's because from looking for the most direct information that's impacting the market and"
"188350","188810"," currently."
"189710","194490"," And for me, I find that there's a story that's told by Flow Algo each day. "
"195470","199050"," So each day you'll see a bunch of calls, let's see a bunch of calls come out right at the"
"199050","203910"," bell, you'll see a bunch of quick pumps on individual tickers, and then those tickers sometimes"
"203910","204850"," will fall off, right?"
"205590","207910"," But then you'll see a story get written throughout the day."
"208270","213390"," You'll start to see specific tickers over and over and over again in the course of a day."
"213490","218750"," So this is from yesterday and you'll start to see the same tickers come up as the day progresses. "
"219750","224230"," You'll see the algo score here on the right-hand side with these blue bars that give it a higher"
"224230","227010"," score depending upon a bunch of different factors, right?"
"227870","232230"," And then when there's moments of weakness in the market, you'll start to see some put flow in"
"232230","233370"," between these moments, right?"
"233950","238090"," And I'm going to show you one other thing here to just try to give it to you in a"
"238090","239350"," more concise manner."
"239690","247090"," You can see the flow ratio up here as well, but what's key about Flow Algo is you'll see each"
"247090","251730"," day I'm telling you, hey remember we looked at this, hey remember we looked at that, right?"
"252190","254090"," And you're going to see some weird things, right?"
"254270","258370"," You're going to see an example for yesterday was Joby, J-O-B-Y."
"258490","262070"," We don't ever see call Flow on Flow Algo for Joby. "
"262530","265950"," So we'll see if we see something unusual like this, right?"
"266110","270950"," It sticks right up on our screener and we're saying, why is there so much interest in Joby this"
"270950","271130"," afternoon?"
"271890","273790"," Why is there interest in open this afternoon?"
"274370","276210"," Why is there interest in SC this afternoon?"
"276450","278010"," Why is there interest in Roblox today?"
"278590","279290"," That doesn't carry it."
"279410","285490"," Sometimes if you don't see the flow, if you see the flow all day long, you don't see a day"
"285490","287290"," two, three, four, five days down the road."
"288290","294010"," But if you're seeing that action that day, you can usually guarantee that action is important for"
"294010","294570"," that day, right?"
"294810","299510"," You're of mine to a stock, Roblox, a good example, but let's see you buy into a stock, you see"
"299510","304490"," some flow into it, you buy into it, and the second day everybody leaves your stock, right?"
"305390","309410"," So if you start to see reaction right away that day, we trade it that day. "
"309670","316050"," If you don't see any reaction that day, you should then hold for a longer period of time and track"
"316050","320090"," those options and make sure that there's still interest in them over time."
"321650","325090"," But you'll see, you see space here yesterday with 18 orders yesterday."
"325990","327230"," Very unusual for space. "
"327430","329130"," We don't see flow like this, right?"
"329550","331770"," So this is clear, concise, actionable flow."
"332470","337370"," I know I've used all the flow services out there, and this is the one for me that I can"
"337370","338810"," that I can pee into."
"339130","342050"," So if you're listening to me all morning long and you're like, why does it keep mentioning space?"
"342590","343810"," Why does it keep mentioning space?"
"344110","345590"," Why does it keep mentioning space, right?"
"346150","347310"," It's because it's unusual. "
"347650","351850"," It's because we've got multiple orders of that space flow, right?"
"352530","354210"," But it's something to key and target into."
"354490","355770"," Now this doesn't hit everything."
"355770","359830"," You'll see some tickers fly all day long, and it will all go miss it. "
"360150","365170"," But consistently over time, if you were to use flow server, all right, well me using flow services,"
"365450","369870"," I've had the most success overall by using flow agos."
"370050","372930"," So when I'm calling out tickers to, it's not all the flow that comes through."
"373490","378970"," This is, I'm picking from flow that's already been handpicked over from the larger sites. "
"379010","383770"," When you start seeing all this information across other sites, they're condensing it, and then I'm"
"383770","388830"," condensing it down even farther for you from my experience with flow ago over time."
"389370","390570"," So I'm going to keep that short."
"391230","398370"," I'm sure that somebody else can answer those questions for you more clearly in another in a discord"
"398370","402590"," or somewhere else where you can you can even get a trial for it and then just don't sign up"
"402590","402950"," for it. "
"403550","406510"," Cleaning the trials like 30 bucks, seeing at least going to feel for it."
"406610","412170"," If you ever get this for the first time, it took me like at least a month to be able"
"412170","416230"," to start following along and find out which flow was worth it and which flow was not worth it."
"417450","419210"," Next thing for today, it's already 917. "
"419710","421810"," Next thing for today, we had Shopify earnings this morning."
"422510","423910"," No Bueno, right?"
"424010","428870"," We've got Nvidia earnings after the Bell today, which is big quantum scape, Matterport, Marathon,"
"429670","431990"," Cisco, DoorDash, Fastly."
"432130","433650"," So we'll be tracking these today. "
"434650","437350"," We've got Palantir on Thursday before the Bell."
"437570","440770"," We'll take a look at the market profile for this one again."
"441510","443890"," We know Palantir, the support right now is down at 10 bucks. "
"444070","447510"," We have Walmart, Roku, Fiver, Dropbox, Sunrun."
"448010","455290"," We saw some movement yesterday in these alternative energy stocks and ETFs."
"455330","463750"," We saw movement as well yesterday in, I think it was in, what is it, semiconductors?"
"464310","465970"," We got Yeti Quiddell as well. "
"466530","467290"," Redfin still."
"467770","472210"," So we still have some big movers this week for DraftKings and John Deere on Friday before they"
"472210","472470"," open."
"473490","476610"," Today, the big news, we've got some oil news coming out. "
"476710","477630"," I think it's 10, 10, 30."
"477870","479870"," And then we've got a roll of contracts coming out on oil."
"480330","481410"," I believe that's on Thursday. "
"482730","484450"," And then we already had most of our news today."
"484530","486830"," The big news today is of course going to be FMC minutes."
"487230","490710"," The only thing I want to say about that is there was no reaction to PPI. "
"491230","499030"," We had a reaction on CPI, but we don't know if in the minutes there was a discussion saying, hey,"
"499310","506410"," if CPI was hot and PPI was hot, maybe we're going to use our tools more aggressively."
"507250","511409"," And so that I think is where some of the volatility lies in the market right now."
"511870","514549"," So just be conscious of that for waiting for that 230 hour. "
"515010","520990"," I typically end up trading FMC minutes against whoever has more calls or more puts, whoever has the"
"520990","521590"," most to lose."
"522150","524130"," So we'll track this as we get closer to the 230 hour today."
"524910","527470"," Next thing we're going to go to a spot again report for this morning. "
"529190","536850"," Futures are trading at $44.54 down from over the highs of $44.83. Models to continue to estimate"
"536850","542230"," high volatility resistance at $44.70. And then $4500."
"542430","544730"," Support is at $44.50 and $4400."
"544870","545930"," We know about these support levels. "
"547130","552230"," We've seen a shift higher in the gamut tied to $4500 and view that as resistance into Friday's"
"552230","552530"," OPEX."
"553830","554770"," That is important to know."
"556610","559890"," Additionally, it seems that despite what seemed like a bull's trading setup markets were unable to"
"559890","561950"," gain interaction once the cash session opened. "
"563030","567090"," Have you remained flat throughout yesterday's session as did our hair on today delta readings."
"567690","569270"," This is a neutral trading."
"569970","571510"," And what we did, thank you very much. "
"571550","578970"," What we deemed a neutral zone and anecdotally is a signal in and of itself bulls unable to move the"
"578970","579290"," needle."
"580250","580530"," Right."
"580630","585630"," We always talk on this channel about we want to see call expansion much higher, not in the money,"
"585630","587130"," not the same day. "
"587510","589310"," We want to see it month to three months out."
"589430","591730"," We want to see it way outside the money, bulls thinking they were going to 480."
"592230","593110"," We're not going to 480. "
"593550","597930"," But if it goes to 480 with call structure, you'll see us go to 460, 470 and higher, right."
"599430","603810"," Further, we note that $4500 is our call wall, which means our models read that as the line as a"
"603810","608130"," strike was most net positive gamma in our main resistance line."
"608350","609750"," They don't make a note of this here, right. "
"610070","615530"," But our expiry for Friday is loaded to the tips and puts down to like 425."
"616510","618630"," They don't want to print those puts, right."
"618630","620090"," So that's kind of the key, right. "
"620250","621350"," Are we going to print those puts or not?"
"621750","628250"," But those puts the print you're going to have to see today a wall, a literal wall of put flow"
"628250","630870"," come in to print whatever puts are down there."
"631010","634170"," So we're going to keep our eyes on that today, tomorrow and Friday."
"634730","637950"," Otherwise, market makers are not going to want to print that flow down there. "
"638690","640350"," They're not going to want to send us that low."
"641070","641230"," Okay."
"641550","645350"," And the rest of the call, rest of the flow that's out there is 4,500 for a strike. "
"647950","649510"," Material like of dam, here we go."
"649610","653450"," So further, we note that $45 is call wall, which means our models read that line as the strike with"
"653450","655830"," the most net positive gamma in our main resistance line."
"656210","661230"," This means this seems to be more due to the attrition of call gamma at higher strikes, which"
"661230","663190"," suggests the material lack of demand for upside calls. "
"663190","666730"," The clear calls listed at 4,500 aren't particularly large as shown below."
"666850","667170"," That's good."
"667670","670850"," It is fairly, it is fairly small shifts these levels. "
"671410","674590"," The registering changes to our models speak through a general lack of market conviction."
"675290","676050"," We agree with that, right."
"676730","680870"," We know that there's bulls out there that are saying, I've heard all the stories and all about the"
"680870","687450"," under the under the surface, dark pool buying, all that shit. "
"687550","688050"," I've heard all that shit."
"688210","689010"," That's that's not true."
"689290","689750"," It isn't. "
"689770","690290"," It isn't true."
"690890","691290"," I should say."
"692670","695870"," And I've heard all the bears say, you know, we're going to roll this market over right here, right?"
"696070","699170"," We're going to we've heard guys talking about a HYG. "
"700090","701310"," HYG is sitting on support."
"701310","703550"," If it crashes there, market market doom, right?"
"704150","707890"," I've heard also heard people say if it's HYG gets bought today, we're going to rip much higher."
"707890","709590"," We're at a bottom right now. "
"710230","711430"," We could go either way."
"711770","716010"," If you start if we start seeing some some ugly shit come out of the minutes, it's going to be"
"716010","716210"," ugly."
"717890","719710"," So I can't call which direction we're going. "
"720010","722950"," You guys remember yesterday that the belly yesterday said to you last night the bell."
"723190","727050"," It was more geared towards the speech it was given, but even so, it doesn't matter."
"727670","729070"," There's no conviction in the market. "
"729190","732570"," I couldn't take a conviction trade either way into that belly yesterday."
"732730","733230"," It was uncomfortable."
"733890","734310"," It is rare. "
"734990","735390"," Rare."
"735870","737050"," I don't take a trade in the day."
"737050","740030"," It is rare that I can't make a conviction into the overnight. "
"741010","746770"," With the addition of calls at two forty five hundred, our gamma flip points ball trigger now rests"
"746770","747870"," at forty four seventy."
"748110","749670"," Be careful of that number, okay?"
"750070","754310"," Four four seventy, which implies that dealers do not have much hedging to do from a gamer's"
"754310","757410"," perspective coupled with the forty five hundred gamma buildup."
"757410","762990"," We see forty four fifty forty five hundred areas of fairly solid resistance point for today. "
"763970","765110"," Five e comes for sale."
"765770","770550"," That will be a mechanism in the push markets higher, but without large deltas coming from put sales"
"770550","773950"," and or coral call purchases, we think upside remains fairly limited."
"774250","775770"," That's that's speaking to sideways, right?"
"777030","781830"," Additionally, there are about twenty thousand total contracts, ten thousand K each and puts calls"
"781830","785970"," added to the forty four fifty strike, which suggests that the forty four hundred forty five hundred"
"785970","788470"," ranges less fluid than noted yesterday. "
"789050","791410"," Forty four hundred remains solid support short term."
"793490","795710"," Friday's expiration is still put heavy."
"796010","797050"," That is the key, right?"
"797550","801150"," Four four two five massive massive put puts over there. "
"801550","805290"," The decay of those puts should help buoy markets into Friday."
"805910","810670"," When they say that, I mean, as long as you don't get a put flow pushing us down in there,"
"810730","810850"," right?"
"811090","815250"," Getting to selling any kind of nonsense in Russian news, anything like that, we should be safe."
"816550","818210"," I'll scroll through this shortly for you. "
"819310","822470"," And what we'll do is we'll just chart out the day real quick briefly."
"822510","823970"," Yesterday we did ES, I think."
"824430","828850"," So we're going to today do a mum weeble right now. "
"829510","830790"," I cleared this whole entire chart."
"831130","836410"," And so let's take a look at it real quick and snap some lines on on on on on spy"
"836410","837270"," right in SPX."
"838030","841090"," We're going to snap some simple lines on SPX for today's trading day. "
"842390","845610"," And there are some setups for long and short on today's trading day."
"847210","848730"," At the orange one out today, huh?"
"852390","853870"," Okay, so we'll do something like this."
"854450","856550"," We'll make this straight here. "
"858430","865830"," We know I know the bulls are saying to know the bulls are saying that some somewhere in Oh, wait"
"865830","866870"," a minute, I get rid of this here."
"870890","878150"," I'm not too concerned about the open right now because I want to show you what I think about what"
"879720","880960"," the bulls are saying here."
"886530","889550"," We've got this support down here at 4400, right?"
"894580","897100"," Somewhere down in here, right?"
"897320","901100"," We were supposed to know that support is down here at that 4400. "
"905720","907100"," We have this larger."
"907760","909020"," You guys remember this larger."
"912130","915990"," It's actually is a larger trend line that moves way upright. "
"916910","918270"," We had resistance at 460."
"918370","923770"," We traded outside of the bound back down into this lower bound, right?"
"923990","925590"," This is our trading area right here."
"926230","931550"," We know that we've got resistance above at 4500, right?"
"931790","932970"," Remember that number of 4500?"
"935250","940790"," We got another one just above it at 4520, right?"
"940890","943750"," That upper bound that we're looking for. "
"943750","948110"," And we know we've got volatility at 4470, right?"
"949170","954750"," That one in there will change it to we got just a few minutes left into the bell opens here,"
"954750","955770"," four minutes."
"956310","960610"," So we'll take this down to a closer look here."
"962610","963250"," I'm here. "
"966460","968200"," I'm going to feel for it now, right?"
"969260","972740"," Now we're looking for we're sitting right on the support line coming into the bell here."
"973560","976380"," You can see we've got some support down here at 4400."
"976860","982540"," And then there was another number down here, 4454, 4483. "
"983340","986080"," You could pop those in, 4043, 43."
"986400","991720"," We got a Miss Donald's scratch that we've got resistance at 4470."
"991720","993720"," We got that one, 444500. "
"994220","999960"," As 4470 is the volatility zone right up in here, 4400 is a resistance."
"1000620","1003420"," And then support is at 4450 and 4400."
"1004380","1006660"," So we're below or support. "
"1007380","1008980"," Excuse me, is that a 40?"
"1009360","1009760"," Let me see here."
"1011400","1015260"," 4450 roughly right there."
"1016500","1018820"," And you can see that we're below support, right?"
"1021240","1022520"," So we're looking at closer chart here. "
"1022660","1029780"," I'm just going to get this closer without the so this is our this basically our trading range."
"1029859","1031900"," And this is our volatility zone up above."
"1032500","1037780"," We can buy longs below this and shorts above it. "
"1038540","1042819"," And I want to give you guys briefly, times of now we've got two minutes left."
"1045530","1048130"," Sorry about this morning."
"1048330","1055010"," I got a trying to post on Twitter and then I'm trying to my children have dentist appointments"
"1055010","1055570"," today. "
"1059270","1061870"," I'm just going to take a look at this trading range right here, right?"
"1062290","1066730"," Should be able to figure this out for yourself this morning where we shouldn't trade lower than"
"1066730","1067270"," right in here."
"1067410","1071910"," If we trade below 43, 755, your full time bear gang, right?"
"1072150","1073850"," You are going super duper bear."
"1074330","1077570"," Anything down here, we'll try to buy a dip to run it up. "
"1078610","1084050"," We're going to be looking for if we just trade tight all day long into that two o'clock to"
"1084050","1084630"," 30 hour."
"1084650","1090250"," If we don't break this line right here, this line right here, we don't break that line as we head"
"1090250","1093330"," into two p.m. That's my suspicion, right?"
"1093450","1098250"," That we're going to trade in here and that we're going to, right around two 30, will be parked"
"1098250","1099210"," right around here."
"1100190","1103170"," And we're either going to move up or we're going to move down today. "
"1104110","1108250"," If you see us trade up here, perfect opportunity for some shorts to trade it down."
"1108590","1111310"," If we trade down or some way over here, I should be over here."
"1111710","1116470"," If we trade down here, I'm going to be looking to buy some longs to get us back into this"
"1116470","1117170"," trading range today. "
"1117250","1121630"," I don't know why I'm having problems with Webull this morning, but you guys get to get the point on"
"1121630","1122030"," this, right?"
"1124510","1124910"," Coffee?"
"1125430","1127990"," I don't smoke cigarettes, but I do have coffee."
"1131160","1135220"," Okay, and then I'm going to drop this one here before the bell."
"1136140","1141280"," We're just going to look at the volume profile, right?"
"1141460","1146300"," We talked about Facebook yesterday, two 17, right?"
"1146720","1147400"," Valuary low. "
"1147860","1151000"," If you guys have some tickers, you want me to call out real quick before I get book map rolling."
"1152160","1153300"," Now is the time."
"1154840","1159560"," So shout out some tickers and I will look at some tickers for you off this bell. "
"1160740","1164060"," Also note, keep an eye on J and K this morning."
"1169410","1175490"," I think you knew who brought that up was who brought that up was."
"1178010","1187360"," I think it was Mike from Oh shit, what's the name of his"
"1187360","1188260"," channel?"
"1188540","1191800"," But Mike, I figured it was a lot in the last name, but I'll bring up his channel later today. "
"1192740","1200320"," You want to see if J and K grabs a bid as it is in longtime support"
"1200320","1204600"," that calls off the bell on Facebook."
"1206360","1208340"," Spy is reacting off the bell."
"1210140","1211140"," Okay, let's see what we got. "
"1214520","1216080"," Okay, so we'll do PLTR."
"1217140","1218660"," We know where Facebook is."
"1219820","1220940"," I know you guys are panicking. "
"1221120","1223900"," You see all those those Palantir videos out there."
"1224540","1227120"," This Palantir going to $10."
"1232460","1237340"," Okay, we've got the Palantir is on a 15 day rates that value area high right now. "
"1237640","1239140"," It's a tie right now, right?"
"1239540","1240740"," Sitting on some nice support."
"1243280","1252860"," We'll look at it on a time axis, especially if you're buying the dips on something like this."
"1255660","1257240"," Look at it in 180 days. "
"1257640","1264590"," Okay, and we're below right or below where we should be."
"1265750","1275550"," We'll look at it again in 90 day"
"1275550","1276110"," time axis."
"1279090","1281270"," It's still below right undervalued stock. "
"1282050","1285990"," Yesterday we saw that the buyers are on bookmapper down at $10."
"1286350","1287390"," So be aware of that."
"1288790","1295030"," But currently undervalued if they have a we know that they haven't had some good good ERs. "
"1296550","1300430"," But we do know that they should at some point, right?"
"1301090","1302030"," Let me see here."
"1302330","1303050"," Time axis."
"1304030","1306850"," We're going to do 15 days. "
"1308090","1312010"," Build it 20 days for all of these 20 to 20 moving average."
"1315260","1317300"," And it's looking overvalued right now, right?"
"1317700","1321020"," But it is sitting on some nice support over a longer period of time."
"1321640","1324040"," You can buy it at 14 bucks a little bit down to 10 bucks. "
"1328020","1329040"," Let me see what you got here."
"1329200","1337320"," If we did PLTR, Tesla, then GDX, spies getting a bid out there below support."
"1338180","1340940"," You're going to have a price target if we're trading higher right here. "
"1341000","1347540"," If you are in calls right now, the price target is 44.5.25 on the spy."
"1348060","1348580"," If you are long."
"1352580","1353020"," Tesla. "
"1358750","1361910"," Tesla is sitting right on the cusp, right?"
"1362070","1363510"," There was another one I wanted to show you guys."
"1364030","1370310"," So Tesla, you could buy a straddle right here very invariably, right?"
"1371290","1374190"," But I have straddle right here sitting on some kind of support."
"1374970","1378950"," But it wouldn't it wouldn't be nothing to slip below and trade below back to 850. "
"1379750","1382490"," The same story that we've been trading a lot with with Tesla."
"1383510","1388250"," I'm going to anticipate that the market is going to decide the fate of Tesla."
"1389230","1391870"," How's he move into 230 PM this afternoon?"
"1394030","1395650"," We'll look at GDX. "
"1396030","1398390"," I think it was GDX right, but I was interested in gold."
"1400620","1401820"," Where is GDX?"
"1403860","1404560"," Gold miners."
"1406100","1409600"," Gold miners over a 15 day is just waiting to be sold down. "
"1410120","1412320"," I look for support at 3191."
"1413500","1416200"," I wouldn't take a long here until you break above 3291."
"1418040","1419880"," I'll be looking for some support at 3192. "
"1421180","1425100"," Value area low is 2996 and 3057."
"1425780","1433540"," If you are looking for a move higher from here, you're going to be looking for anything above 3297"
"1433540","1435560"," is going to be very bullish."
"1449210","1452010"," Here's BA. "
"1452490","1458510"," Value area low, 199.26. Point of control is 207."
"1459850","1468030"," We're going to look for bumps along the way at 213.16. Then a swift move down to like 20887."
"1468330","1469590"," Any more bad news?"
"1470750","1472530"," Easily see 200. "
"1476340","1477040"," Next one."
"1478260","1479500"," Hey, good morning Chris."
"1479660","1479920"," How are you?"
"1480380","1480960"," ABMB. "
"1485430","1486430"," ABMB next."
"1488110","1489690"," ABMB flying high, right?"
"1490390","1494450"," We know that Airbnb can trade much higher than 180."
"1496050","1499750"," I would be looking for a rebuy in around 160. "
"1500870","1502990"," If there's any kind of a..."
"1502990","1512430"," Let's see if I can get a better time frame on Airbnb long-term play, right?"
"1513710","1515470"," I look at it as a long-term play."
"1519700","1521440"," Still trading quite high here."
"1521620","1523520"," There's a six-month trade here, right?"
"1523740","1524480"," Just be careful. "
"1524480","1526320"," Tell these single prints up here."
"1526720","1533360"," You want to be careful here for some kind of a pullback to at least 171 and possibly even back"
"1533360","1535080"," down into this area here."
"1535180","1538660"," This is at 155.160. But I do like it here. "
"1538700","1539200"," It's very bullish."
"1540040","1540800"," You know what I would say?"
"1540880","1548060"," If you're going to look for another rebuy or buyback in, you're going to be looking for 171 and"
"1548060","1551080"," possibly some resistance around 190."
"1554940","1555420"," MTTR. "
"1555780","1556680"," Do that one next."
"1558600","1560440"," I'm going to try to get here earlier every day."
"1560660","1563240"," It's hard for me to get here earlier every day. "
"1563840","1564700"," Look at that."
"1564840","1565280"," How beautiful."
"1567100","1568520"," It's not a smaller time frame. "
"1571140","1572660"," Everybody's chewing on this one, right?"
"1578040","1578360"," Matterport."
"1578960","1579120"," Pi."
"1580000","1580000"," Okay. "
"1581220","1583080"," It looks like it's trading down currently."
"1583720","1586620"," The buy zone, 775, right?"
"1586780","1590360"," Price target, 992 on MTTR."
"1591960","1592760"," Let's see here. "
"1593200","1593640"," CVX."
"1594860","1600820"," Let me see here."
"1601040","1601480"," CVX. "
"1603080","1604380"," I think today is a trap."
"1605000","1606640"," I think today is a trap."
"1606840","1608240"," You're going to trap in the bulls and the bears. "
"1610260","1611480"," Ooh, I don't know about this."
"1611940","1613560"," Looks like this point of control is down here."
"1613620","1616260"," We have to go to a larger time frame. "
"1616700","1617620"," Looks like real support."
"1617620","1619040"," It's like 130, 184."
"1619200","1620280"," I'd be scared of this. "
"1620400","1621760"," This looks very bearish to me."
"1622920","1623660"," It could be wrong."
"1623880","1624740"," I get these wrong sometimes. "
"1625040","1626560"," It don't take my..."
"1626560","1628200"," I'm not the end all sale."
"1628540","1634020"," If I'm going to do 2030 tickers, I'm not going to get all 20 correct."
"1634900","1636220"," So just be conscious of that. "
"1641660","1645160"," Don't be like, yeah, see the..."
"1645160","1645940"," I don't know."
"1646400","1647760"," It was a six month chart, man."
"1648480","1649140"," You've got accumulation. "
"1649780","1650120"," I like it."
"1650920","1652600"," I like the trade higher, maybe the 140."
"1653620","1658120"," But I'd be really concerned about this because real support currently stands at 119. "
"1659160","1660140"," You can see that, right?"
"1660640","1662080"," With how thin this is right here."
"1662660","1663260"," That real support."
"1663440","1666860"," If there's any bad news, expect at least 119 and CVX. "
"1667060","1672720"," Not that it's not 139."
"1673520","1675800"," Looks like there's some selling down below."
"1676180","1678240"," Maybe a first first report. "
"1678340","1679220"," We won 30-26."
"1680920","1682040"," 128-08."
"1683320","1684880"," 125-32. "
"1685360","1687540"," Any bad news at all heading back to 120."
"1689740","1690300"," GME."
"1690740","1691920"," You guys want me to do GME?"
"1694710","1695270"," Savages. "
"1696490","1698190"," Get all the bag holders out today."
"1700830","1702550"," Here we go, right?"
"1703450","1704890"," That's what you're looking for, 232."
"1705670","1713730"," And you've got wall of sellers above here at 143.77. Currently trading at 135-26. "
"1715030","1717890"," Be aware that there's resistance right at 147, okay?"
"1718770","1719610"," Get some nice support here."
"1720190","1723610"," If you grow this a little bit more, you should be able to trade higher."
"1723770","1727930"," We'll look at a smaller time frame for you on this one for an intraday trade. "
"1730920","1731660"," I'm access."
"1735800","1737320"," I'll do 20 days for you."
"1737860","1738260"," Bye. "
"1738700","1738960"," Hey."
"1739840","1742480"," And just looking at this at this 20 days, right?"
"1742600","1744540"," Last 20 days, lots of support up here."
"1745100","1746040"," I like this bullish. "
"1746380","1747600"," I'm going to call it bullish right now."
"1748020","1751580"," So you're going to be trying to price target somewhere below 140, I guess."
"1751920","1752420"," You're looking for it. "
"1752480","1753300"," You're looking to trade up to 140."
"1754480","1758000"," Looks like you get some fat support down here on a 28 chart down at 115."
"1759800","1762720"," So if you want to buy the dip moment to 115, trade it to 140. "
"1767240","1769760"," I had to build the volume profile."
"1770700","1772180"," I had to build it from scratch."
"1775200","1775560"," RBLX. "
"1775700","1777060"," We looked at RBLX yesterday, right?"
"1777220","1777860"," What did I tell you guys?"
"1778120","1780040"," Where does support lie in RBLX 60?"
"1780920","1782720"," We'll see if that's still told true."
"1783640","1786960"," And sure enough, 60 was."
"1787640","1788540"," No, you know what?"
"1788580","1790400"," It wasn't here that we saw the support of 60. "
"1791220","1800600"," We saw support yesterday in Roblox down at 60 bucks on market or on book map is where we saw"
"1800600","1803200"," the support on the market profile."
"1803660","1805620"," This isn't going to be a good chart for you for Roblox."
"1807660","1808720"," Good morning, Joe. "
"1810740","1812980"," The market is actually funky up and down."
"1813280","1814880"," So far as ripping, Viacom's under."
"1815100","1817220"," Yeah, James, I've got that on my screen here today, bro. "
"1817720","1821580"," I am going to probably buy some leaps on Viacom today."
"1823060","1824520"," Did Snap get whacked to?"
"1825160","1826380"," Shop Shop Viacom?"
"1827240","1827640"," Oh, dude."
"1828100","1832460"," So we were trading Viacom in December when it was at 28 bucks. "
"1833820","1835960"," So we're going to trade that one again."
"1838180","1838460"," Okay."
"1839040","1840160"," Ooh, nice job, Fabio. "
"1840960","1841480"," We'll look at Shop."
"1842980","1846260"," Shop's general support is right around that 780 mark."
"1847040","1849160"," We'll look at a large time frame. "
"1849160","1850260"," We'll look at it on book map, too."
"1850900","1852340"," We'll look at some of these tickers."
"1853800","1856780"," Shop Viacom you have to kind of look at on a much longer time frame. "
"1857740","1859060"," We'll go 360 days."
"1859500","1860120"," Buy it."
"1862330","1862770"," Okay. "
"1863210","1865190"," And it's a value real low rate down here, right?"
"1865430","1865730"," 786."
"1867630","1869130"," We will look at this on."
"1870470","1872110"," We'll look at this on book map. "
"1872290","1875110"," But I remember it being right around 750 to 800."
"1875710","1878770"," Can't remember exactly where the real support was on Shop Viacom."
"1878830","1879510"," We'll take a look at that later. "
"1879970","1881270"," I'm going to bring up book map real quick."
"1882110","1883870"," And we'll start checking tickers there."
"1884470","1887210"," And we'll get this thing up and run and spin. "
"1887910","1888590"," See here."
"1890270","1891790"," We have book map up and run."
"1904460","1907500"," I think it's up and run. "
"1909360","1910720"," Let me just a second here."
"1919460","1920980"," We'll see if we're at support on."
"1927760","1930000"," Yeah, I should get this up and running before the stream. "
"1930200","1931780"," It takes a while if I'm already streaming."
"1932480","1933260"," Streaming is taxing."
"1936480","1938240"," I think a microphone is taxing, too. "
"1939140","1941500"," A real low external data."
"1945730","1947650"," We'll see if we actually have support down here."
"1948470","1950210"," That much has happened in the spy though, huh?"
"1951050","1951510"," We'll see. "
"1956810","1960830"," We'll see if our traditional charting matches up in the spot gamma levels match up."
"1967620","1968800"," Check the spy."
"1970660","1971660"," Play Facebook. "
"1971940","1973340"," Facebook got whacked."
"1974000","1976840"," You can't hold anything in this market longer than a day."
"1979360","1981240"," Remember we talked about this yesterday. "
"1981680","1984200"," I want to be clear with you or this morning, right?"
"1984300","1987720"," You guys heard me talk this morning about what we don't want to see."
"1988360","1995580"," And I just saw March 7th, 442 P 2.6 million dollars."
"1996160","1997820"," And you guys heard what I said, right?"
"1998530","2003200"," That you don't want to see the addition of puts to print. "
"2006660","2007440"," Excuse me."
"2009360","2020280"," You don't want to see the addition of puts to print into into"
"2020280","2022580"," OPEX and we're seeing it right now."
"2024040","2024960"," That sucks. "
"2026020","2035220"," So watching watching spy puts March 7th, 442"
"2035220","2039140"," P 2.6 million dollars."
"2040480","2044140"," Even if we don't go down here, it's a block trade."
"2044680","2050659"," Even if we don't go down here, I want you to know that it will impact the spy. "
"2050960","2053900"," So if you're long right here, be careful for the next 10-15 minutes."
"2058860","2059840"," I feel for you, bulls."
"2060060","2060340"," I'm a bull. "
"2060600","2061560"," I am a bull."
"2062080","2064719"," So I'm a trading as a bear right now, but I am a bull."
"2070580","2071659"," We'll take a look right here. "
"2071820","2076980"," Here indicator just of course must have turned stupid negative with that put buying."
"2077460","2079300"," I'll list off some more puts for you."
"2079300","2083219"," I've got UPST puts March 18th, 120 P, 170,000 dollars. "

"2098260","2099820"," I don't know if that trade is even worth the money."
"2099820","2100540"," Maybe it is."
"2101300","2102040"," It might be. "
"2102280","2103420"," It seems like a long way to go."
"2104060","2106320"," Or not a long way to go for not a lot of profit."
"2106960","2108720"," I remember it might let Roblox cool off. "
"2108880","2111500"," Plug calls February 25th, 24 C."

"2143980","2145300"," 200,000 dollars."
"2145380","2146240"," But broken up, right?"
"2147280","2148580"," What else do we have here?"
"2149130","2158680"," More space puts, more Facebook calls, puts on pound here, across the board and puts on Facebook"
"2158680","2159060"," too. "
"2159880","2161560"," A lots of lots of puts on Facebook."
"2164020","2165700"," And what else do we have here?"
"2167260","2173680"," Puts on X, February 18, 24 P for two sweeps for 30,000 dollars total."
"2174240","2180460"," Puts on S E, heads up on that one, S E, February 18th, 144 P for half, no enough million"
"2180460","2180940"," dollars. "
"2181980","2186140"," AMC puts, February 18th, 19 P, 40,000 dollars."
"2186840","2188800"," Okay, so now we got all that out of the way."
"2189320","2193580"," We can see that there's support right here at 443 74. "
"2196120","2200000"," We'll take a look on a larger time frame on spy."
"2201840","2205000"," Remember that negative hero indicator of the time, right?"
"2205740","2214760"," We've got sellers above at 447.36. We'll look for where support is below."
"2219850","2223130"," Looks like the buyers have come up this morning, which is nice to see. "
"2224250","2226790"," Next support, 43489, 430."
"2229170","2230550"," To the real money as though."
"2232510","2241430"," Real money is down at 425.35, 421.79. This is where the real money is down here, okay?"
"2242070","2248690"," If you're a bull and you're risk-aversive, and if you think we're going down, that's the price"
"2248690","2252690"," target probably for OPEC's if the bears have their way. "
"2258180","2260280"," So get this a little more granular here."
"2267450","2272610"," And you can see this support here has moved up or has been rug pulled at this moment."
"2273390","2281830"," It's on 443.77. And just be aware of that negative hero indicator. "
"2282110","2289270"," If that hero indicator stays like minus 18,000 and gets like minus 20,000 minus 50,000, over time"
"2289270","2289990"," we're going to go down."
"2290950","2297190"," Now, let's say it goes to minus 50,000 and then it moves from minus 50,000 to minus 40 "
"2297190","2300770",",000 minus 30,000 minus 10,000 zero."
"2301210","2302510"," That's bullish still, okay?"
"2302610","2304190"," We're getting bullish at that point. "
"2307970","2309670"," So you've got support and resistance."
"2309730","2312090"," We'll see if this support holds up or not."
"2316420","2317120"," So good morning, everybody. "
"2317600","2318420"," Good to see you all out there."

"2322500","2323940"," Good to see you all."
"2327280","2329280"," Everybody's asking what's going on with APPS."
"2329540","2330480"," So we'll take a look at that next. "
"2332440","2338780"," Again, screamed at and on chat and on discord."
"2341240","2343140"," We'll take a look at APPS with that load up."
"2352000","2352900"," Good morning, Matthew. "
"2353200","2353460"," How are you?"
"2358380","2361460"," 200 really good dip, 200 teen is bottom support the channel."
"2361760","2363060"," UPST on a rocket ship."
"2363280","2364580"," Look up UPST as well next. "
"2365400","2369920"," Nice shout out on UPST. Have you seen calls this morning UPST?"
"2372900","2376280"," It was on UPST at 938."
"2377060","2381400"," It was March 18th, 139 C for $100,000. "
"2384330","2385430"," Any others in here?"

"2416540","2420800"," February 16th, 443 P, $152,000 on the Spy right now. "
"2427100","2427800"," Bye-bye Spy."
"2430740","2431820"," Good morning, Dejan."
"2432180","2433100"," How's everybody doing this morning?"
"2440240","2441560"," So give me a second here. "
"2441640","2442520"," I got to turn off discord."
"2442760","2444340"," It's got too much crap going on."
"2444960","2456420"," Pass me a beer, terrible,"
"2456540","2456680"," right?"
"2458420","2459020"," Everyone's capped. "
"2459440","2462540"," Trust me, I ain't the one influencing the Spy."
"2465800","2467660"," Vix is on a rocket ship, by the way."
"2470080","2472180"," Vix is like, fuck you, we're going back up 27. "
"2477030","2490980"," Price targets below 441.43. 440.12. AMD"
"2490980","2491680"," straight down."
"2492420","2495420"," EPSTS straight call flow of icons dipping."
"2497120","2498220"," Merr, Joey. "
"2498820","2499380"," Merr."
"2501520","2502640"," Joey made some money."
"2503540","2514180"," So you look at apps, APPS. "
"2516890","2518590"," Oh, dude, purple calls."
"2519430","2520990"," That's an old school pumping dump."
"2521550","2523530"," From Wall Street Bets, PRPL. "
"2524950","2530530"," March 18th, 7.5c, $36,000, and you knew else is going to be purple one of these days?"
"2531730","2532610"," Fucking Peton."
"2535250","2539890"," Puts on pins, February 25th, 25p, $54,000."
"2541270","2543130"," This is a tough one on APPS, guys. "
"2544150","2545730"," There are a lot of sellers up here."
"2554450","2555710"," It's not a pretty chart."
"2565390","2567190"," I can't say that it's not a pretty chart. "
"2567470","2569150"," It looks like rail supports up $41."
"2571370","2573910"," 35 is by the fucking dip, BTFD."
"2577050","2579390"," It looks like, I don't know what this looks like. "
"2579530","2580310"," This is a tough one to call."
"2581550","2583570"," I don't know enough about APPS."
"2584470","2585690"," It's not a pretty chart, though. "
"2585790","2587210"," There's a lot of sellers here."
"2587970","2590930"," Speak conscious of there's a lot of sellers on APPS right now."
"2603640","2605220"," What do you want to know about American Airlines?"
"2607100","2608940"," I'm going to do AAAL for you. "
"2609700","2610500"," I'm going to do AAAL."
"2612120","2618380"," We know that airlines and you know with thoughts on airlines and cruise lines, right?"
"2618700","2620080"," They trade a lot of like."
"2621700","2626980"," So there's a lot of movement that opens and closes on airlines, and cruise lines. "
"2627860","2634540"," You have to look at them as well over the course of a month and not enter trades either way,"
"2634620","2637360"," long or short, without considering a larger chart."
"2638400","2639720"," Look at American Airlines."
"2642280","2652200"," It's by now trading down to $442.56. Still looking for that"
"2652200","2653880"," $441.58 or so. "
"2656540","2662300"," More buyers than sellers on American Airlines."
"2663240","2665260"," Air indicator is negative currently."
"2667180","2668640"," Walls of sellers here. "
"2668980","2670480"," Unless you get some news out."
"2670760","2672140"," Looks like profit taking, if I had to guess."
"2673140","2674920"," But there's a lot of sellers here. "
"2675100","2677240"," Are you looking for news that we're opening up or something?"
"2684660","2686420"," Yeah, so let's talk about VICOM real quick."
"2686420","2693700"," My long-term trading, my long-term investment on VICOM has nothing to do with earnings."
"2694720","2700860"," It has to do with mergers and acquisitions that should take place on VICOM this year. "
"2702720","2708100"," And I do warn you that the rise in VICOM had nothing to do with earnings."
"2709000","2714960"," It only had to do with the interest and it being so knocked down."
"2714960","2721340"," There were calls that were one month out, three months out, six months out, a year out, with zero"
"2721340","2722080"," premium on them. "
"2722200","2724660"," There were made calls for like five cents, ten cents, three cents."
"2725360","2727540"," You could just buy them, buy them, buy them."
"2728680","2730760"," And all that, it was a premium play. "
"2730940","2731600"," That's all it was."
"2731920","2739180"," It was never meant to be an ER or a turnaround or anything like that from the get-go."
"2739820","2742080"," It was that nobody wanted it, nobody wanted to touch it. "
"2742080","2747380"," And the reality is that there is, the reality is that it's more of a long-term trade."
"2747940","2756200"," Let's say someone buys VICOM, adds their TV shows, their movies, they have a basket of, or"
"2756200","2764380"," what you call it, the library of properties that are very valuable to, not Netflix, but maybe like"
"2764380","2771220"," a Roku or something like that to add titles to their library."
"2772080","2777120"," So that trade, you're always looking for that trade for, you're looking for VICOM to shit the bed,"
"2777820","2783280"," all interest to bleed out of calls, and then you trade it for one to three months, and you keep"
"2783280","2783860"," reloading. "
"2784340","2785960"," We did the math on it one time."
"2786140","2789720"," If they get, if there is an acquisition in the next year, that's the trade, right?"
"2790000","2793820"," You think there's going to be an acquisition this year, but it wouldn't matter when, or it wouldn't"
"2793820","2796480"," matter when it happened."
"2796660","2800340"," You just buy the heavy dips anywhere down around 20 to 30 bucks. "
"2800900","2806060"," You get yourself some one to three month calls, and you reload every quarter."
"2806720","2812660"," You just reload every time in case there is something that comes down the pike, because they will"
"2812660","2813000"," trade."
"2813700","2818640"," If that happens, if you believe in that trade, it would trade to $70, $90 in a day. "
"2819820","2824520"," So you want to be buying like, and this is a trade that you lose money on until it hits."
"2824840","2828060"," So you have to first believe that there's going to be some kind of a merger and acquisition."
"2829100","2834440"," You have to be able to get the calls, weigh outside the money, dirt cheap, and then you need to"
"2834440","2836300"," be able to invest into that trade. "
"2836500","2845340"," It's probably going to cost you $20, $30,000 to print a few hundred grand, and it's intensive in"
"2845340","2845560"," time."
"2845740","2848040"," It could take a year, it could take two years."
"2848300","2851540"," So you have to time it properly. "
"2851840","2856460"," In VICOM, the trade was in December, and we're now in February 16th."
"2856460","2861620"," So you're looking for that trade again, since we're going to start watching VICOM closely."
"2864510","2868470"," More purple calls, March 18th, $5c, $95,000. "
"2869210","2876590"," Facebook, DIP buyers, March 18th, are essentially February 18th to $20c, $172,000, Airbnb, February"
"2876590","2884590"," 18th, $185c, $37,000, and video calls, March 4th, $300c, $84,000."
"2885410","2895090"," IWM, two trades on IWM here, February 25th, 210c, there's a $300,000 call and a"
"2895090","2897890"," $440,000 call."
"2898830","2903990"," Qs, February 16th, 351c, $241,000. "
"2904810","2906230"," There were some matching puts as well."
"2907390","2911190"," March 4th, 332p for $300,000."
"2911190","2914230"," It looks like a split of starting a straddle of some kind. "
"2916380","2917940"," So IWM, we'll take a look at that next."
"2918160","2920300"," We'll look at AAL, we'll look at IWM for that trade."
"2921180","2922100"," See if it's a valid trade. "
"2930790","2934770"," And then I'm going to take a minute here because I'm going to try to position myself for a trade."
"2935950","2940750"," Now when I'm looking at all this stuff, I wasn't able to take a put on the spy, Mr. Trade."
"2961300","2963000"," Let me see you guys are talking about. "
"2966340","2974800"," Okay, so we got here, here's this inventory, US business inventories, 2.1% versus 2.1% expected."
"2975320","2980680"," February NHB, housing market index, 82 versus 82 expected, so that's kind of flat."
"2983620","2990440"," Russia Foreign Minister, US is whipping up tensions, to hamper the inflammation of the pipeline. "
"2991820","2992960"," And it doesn't really mean shit."
"2994700","2997540"," We'll play the, we'll play my partner here, Charlie."
"3006240","3009200"," Yeah, I cover NQ, I trade NQ. "
"3011840","3015400"," I haven't been focusing on NQ recently."
"3016280","3020920"," I was trading NQ a lot last year and I've stayed away from NQ."
"3020920","3026220"," I research it every day and it's interplay into the spy. "
"3027380","3031700"," But the spy is, the NQ makes up this part of the spy, right?"
"3032400","3034420"," The spy is not part of NQ."
"3035700","3044960"," Now my track NQ all day long, I track all a big tech, but I'm not trading it currently."
"3047380","3049640"," If you want me to focus on it a little bit more, I can. "
"3054820","3057760"," So Bobby's buying MTTR calls all day long."
"3059180","3061700"," It's a good spy, it's a spy, get halted."
"3066100","3068860"," So IBM is just in some traffic right now. "
"3068960","3070780"," I'm not really seeing direction."
"3071200","3076640"," There is more support currently where we are with this orange that you see, less sellers above than"
"3076640","3077780"," there are buyers below."
"3078720","3081520"," The here indicator is very good right now on IWM. "
"3081520","3086000"," IWM it looks much more healthier than the spy this morning."
"3086660","3090880"," So you may want to keep your eyes on IWM for a long trade if you are a bull."
"3091300","3098740"," If you don't trade IBM often, you want to be getting in on where everybody else is in, because if"
"3098740","3103840"," you're not, and that trade doesn't always print right away, I always look at IWM like a weekly"
"3103840","3105640"," trade or a monthly trade even now. "
"3106240","3111760"," IWM I don't look at it as we hold the trade for 15 minutes."
"3112580","3116960"," You kind of locked in for a little bit longer than expected."
"3117620","3124660"," There is put concentration right now on February 16th, 204p. "
"3124920","3126760"," There's 3000 contracts that a whole ton."
"3127800","3135120"," There's a lot of calls on February 16th, 205c."
"3137550","3140290"," And we'll look at February 18th. "
"3141110","3144670"," Lots of bears betting against IWM."
"3145050","3148250"," They're all on 200p for February 18th."
"3148350","3149590"," There's a 12,000 contracts. "
"3150990","3154630"," I'm assuming this is a trade against the FMC minutes."
"3155490","3165270"," And then there's a bunch of concentration on February 22nd, 208c for $1.50. If I"
"3165270","3167390"," trade IWM I tend to buy monthlies."
"3167670","3174970"," I don't buy sometimes I buy dailies or weeklies on IWM, but it tends to trade better. "
"3176330","3178850"," Especially if you see, here's an example."
"3180830","3182510"," I see a bunch of calls right now."
"3183230","3184490"," Oh wait a minute, it looks like they're gone. "
"3185270","3186870"," They've disappeared almost like spoofing."
"3189030","3191170"," Yeah, I'm seeing some spoofing."
"3191350","3195530"," Okay, so an example would be for February 22nd. "
"3195670","3199630"," I see a lot of good, not a lot, but I see a thousand contracts on 208c."
"3200690","3203970"," So I'd probably get like 206s or 205s."
"3204070","3206050"," So wouldn't stay on those 208s. "
"3206550","3208350"," That takes slightly closer in the money."
"3209450","3211510"," Then we're because they move them around a lot."
"3211610","3213470"," You have to really actively manage it. "
"3213830","3218370"," It's a high actively managed trade and you're in it for a long time."
"3223660","3225340"," You're going to find anything else farther out."
"3226200","3234130"," I think IWM, there's interest on IWM 210c for February 25th. "
"3240690","3246290"," And after that, just a wasteland."
"3249850","3259590"," Some nice calls on February or March 2nd, 209c, $2.62, widespread on this one, $2.62 to $2.67."
"3276890","3280930"," And right now, currently in the spy, everybody's loaded up on four."
"3280930","3283090"," So everybody is straddling the market right now. "
"3283430","3292930"," Everybody's on, the algos are on 445c and 440p for today."
"3294710","3297350"," So there's algos think there's going to be a move today."
"3298590","3307890"," So we've got the dollar, it costs a dollar for 440p and it costs a dollar 12 for 445c"
"3307890","3309910"," for an expiration of today. "
"3309910","3311990"," So they're expecting a move at some point."
"3312770","3315430"," I don't know if I like that."
"3317510","3321790"," I think I like a straddle that's dated for the 18th better. "
"3323530","3325570"," Let's see, we got 289."
"3330630","3338370"," Seems like there's more interest on the put side heading into Friday than there is on the long"
"3338370","3338890"," side."
"3339950","3348490"," But you could take that trade, you know, that 448 and the 440p's and the 445p's. "
"3348490","3354570"," I think it's 440 and 445 for Friday, you know, trade that if you like."
"3356210","3357470"," Unless you're day trading like me."
"3358790","3360610"," But sure, that's like gambling, right?"
"3361330","3362810"," I don't know how many you guys like to gamble. "
"3367030","3371950"," Jamie is moving right on, Vix is climbing, all these little down ticks and then you hear a great"
"3371950","3372670"," long scalps."
"3374710","3379710"," Clean it with his Facebook, goodbye, even though I can't stand, we'll take a look at Facebook next."
"3380770","3381890"," That's a tough one, man. "
"3383490","3385430"," You guys don't want to hear what I have to say about it."
"3391980","3395800"," My assumption is you guys remember when Snap fell?"
"3397260","3401960"," You're going to see Facebook be heavily shorted over a long period of time."
"3404250","3408330"," You'll see it trade sideways and down over one to three months. "
"3410030","3415910"," And then you'll have moments of, you know, rips and you're going to have some capitulation moments"
"3415910","3416970"," of the market falls."
"3417890","3425430"," What you want to look for is, does it participate in market moves up or down?"
"3425950","3427450"," And that will give you the best insight."
"3428410","3434750"," If we have a Ripper rally and Facebook does not participate, that shows that it's heavily shorted,"
"3434910","3435030"," right?"
"3435910","3438150"," And that it's not participating in rallies. "
"3439670","3443250"," If you see it participating, that's a good sign for Facebook."
"3443870","3450310"," If you see us start to ever sell off and Facebook doesn't participate in us selling off, it means"
"3450310","3452470"," that the banks are now loading up on Facebook."
"3454410","3459810"," You'll hear people out there give you all kinds of reasons how to tell, but for me that is more,"
"3460310","3461910"," that's been my best bell weather. "
"3462550","3464970"," That way I don't have to listen to whatever people say in the news."
"3467580","3472220"," The news seems to cloud things."
"3472900","3482700"," Facebook calls February 18th to 20C, $91,000, February"
"3482700","3483660"," 18th to 20C. "
"3485060","3490900"," Facebook March 4th to 10C for $180,000 calls on BA."
"3493140","3495940"," February 25th to 30C, $25,000."
"3496880","3501160"," BBIG, February 25th for C, $27,000. "
"3501780","3504960"," Airbnb, we've been seeing some Airbnb calls this morning."
"3505540","3508600"," February 18th, $195C for $95,000."
"3509060","3510600"," Hood, high algo score. "
"3511460","3514160"," February 25th, 15C, $13,000."
"3515140","3518680"," Space calls, February 18th, $11C, $13,000."
"3519120","3519860"," I don't know about that one. "
"3520620","3524460"," BA, February 25th to 30C for $30,000."
"3524940","3526280"," More calls on American Airlines."
"3527040","3528760"," That's the second or third set we've seen. "
"3529120","3530500"," Maybe somebody knows something I don't know."
"3530960","3535700"," American Airlines, February 18th, 19.5C for $14,000."
"3536120","3539680"," Maybe there's some news that looks like the Wall of Sellers on American Airlines. "
"3539900","3541380"," Maybe there's some news that we don't know about."
"3541520","3542780"," They're going to try to squeeze it higher today."
"3544120","3546280"," So we'll keep an eye on American Airlines for a squeeze. "
"3556450","3558910"," We'd like to see more follow through on NDX breadth."
"3564920","3568040"," Yeah, we'll look at a Facebook right now for some firm levels."
"3569660","3571040"," That's tough man on Facebook. "
"3573900","3578140"," You know, some companies, it's just a matter of taking profit."
"3581340","3584160"," Facebook does have some structural issues."
"3585520","3589180"," You know, Dan Niles, I don't like him a lot, but he made a good point. "
"3589400","3592320"," He made a fair point, right?"
"3592320","3594420"," And that was enough for us as competition."
"3595620","3601660"," You want to see no competition for Facebook."
"3602640","3606040"," They used to highlight and focus their growth in emerging markets. "
"3606960","3607960"," And that's really what you want to hear."
"3608080","3612620"," You want to hear Facebook say something like, oh, yeah, we're investing in, I don't know, South"
"3612620","3613000"," America."
"3613420","3615860"," We're investing in Africa. "
"3615860","3619060"," We're investing in Southeast Asia."
"3619060","3623000"," Our user base is growing when amongst this age group."
"3624800","3626740"," Because that's what their growth is based on, right?"
"3627280","3630080"," New users hooking new junkies that are young. "
"3631900","3633920"," And that's the only death nail that they've got."
"3634240","3642700"," They'll stay strong as long as they're rolling kids into some form of a program, right?"
"3642900","3645120"," Doesn't have to be Facebook could just be something underneath their banner."
"3645520","3648220"," Hey, we hooked them on our version of Roblox. "
"3648220","3653220"," And now we roll them into Insta when they're young adults, and then we're rolling them into"
"3653220","3654520"," Facebook when they're holding crazy."
"3655700","3658560"," We've got lifetime long time hooked addicts."
"3661280","3663020"," Now we've got some firm support here at 210. "
"3664320","3665940"," Looks like we've got more money."
"3666140","3668260"," See the 64,000 buyers here, right?"
"3668420","3670520"," We've got 93,000 buyers at 200."
"3681010","3686490"," And that you can probably call for local support right now. "
"3686490","3689150"," Now the real money is at $200."
"3690770","3692830"," So snap a line on your favorite charting software."
"3693610","3694890"," Set an alert for 210. "
"3695750","3696870"," Set an alert for 200."
"3698010","3703310"," And you guys know if you right click on your support lines, and those are crayons, crayons, but the"
"3703310","3705870"," lines that you draw on your charting software, you might not know this."
"3706330","3710430"," You can right click on them, set up an alert to email you, text you, whatever you like to use. "
"3711370","3714850"," You don't have to pay attention to Facebook each day, and you just wait for it to ring."
"3715370","3719650"," If you do enough of those tickers, you won't chase stocks anymore."
"3720390","3722830"," You'll end up chasing your alerts, right?"
"3723170","3727070"," You'll have like two, three hundred tickers that you don't have to pay attention to every day. "
"3727130","3732310"," And if Facebook ever comes down to 200, then you come back on here and you go, pick up, I"
"3732310","3733650"," got an alert for Facebook at 200."
"3734610","3739570"," The buyers stayed at 200, or are they now down below it, not 190 or 180?"
"3741250","3746850"," VXX puts February 18th, 21.5 p for $41,000."
"3747190","3752110"," Apple calls February 18th, 172.5 c $60,000. "
"3752690","3760870"," Uber, Uber, February 18th, 37.5 c for $139,000."
"3772190","3777090"," Man, I don't know if I had to guess today is going to be a lot of trapping bulls and"
"3777090","3777290"," bears."
"3778110","3780770"," Like, I want to buy this dip right now in the spice so bad. "
"3783260","3786160"," I'm like, man, I know how this goes."
"3787100","3788440"," You know what today's trade is?"
"3788760","3792980"," So I usually, I love trading FMC Minute Days, believe it or not."
"3795530","3797550"," So that nice hair indicator starting to bump up here. "
"3798330","3802150"," All right, I love trading FMC days and FMC Minute Days."
"3802950","3808030"," What typically what I'll do is I'll wait for like a half an hour before the minute release, maybe"
"3808030","3808390"," an hour."
"3808930","3810410"," I'll start looking at it like an hour before. "
"3811030","3815950"," And then a half an hour before the minutes, I will look to see where everybody is."
"3816910","3817350"," No."
"3818930","3819790"," Knock on wood. "
"3820050","3821750"," This has worked every single time."
"3823530","3825550"," But I don't know how many people know about it now."
"3828170","3833030"," Now you sometimes have to be fast with this because it can move. "
"3833410","3838950"," Like, remember I fact the last time among the minutes everybody, I don't know what it was, but"
"3838950","3840310"," everybody let's say was on the call side."
"3841550","3844310"," So we went down, burned all those calls."
"3845170","3845830"," I think not yet. "
"3846330","3847310"," No, that's not what it was."
"3847430","3851450"," Everybody was on the put side last time."
"3852270","3857190"," So I took the call side, we went screaming up, and then we ended up selling off. "
"3857950","3862230"," So you had to like take the call side to burn the value of the puts, right?"
"3863030","3867770"," And then we took the put side when the puts are finally cheap and rode those down."
"3868810","3875850"," Now it's not always like that, but right into FMC minutes, typically if it's going to go that way,"
"3875850","3879410"," let's say everybody's on puts and it is going down, we ain't going straight down."
"3879730","3882910"," They're going to wreck all those puts first, and then they're going to dump it. "
"3885020","3886380"," So sometimes you can wait too."
"3886500","3888020"," You don't have to make both those trades."
"3888560","3890260"," Sometimes you can wait to see which side prints. "
"3891220","3895580"," This time this morning, looks like this is a big straddle in the market."
"3895800","3903360"," So I don't know if that holds true into the minutes today, but usually not all the time."
"3903600","3910680"," They'll intentionally burn whoever has the most pain, whoever will take the most pain, because they"
"3910680","3913020"," don't want to pay everybody, then they're not going to pay everybody. "
"3913760","3915540"," Even if you're right, they're not going to pay you."
"3917200","3920760"," So we'll track the spy as we head into the minutes today."
"3922180","3924040"," About an hour before, we're going to take a look and see. "
"3924540","3926400"," They usually don't drop information before."
"3927040","3930980"," And the other note that I want to make on FMC Minutes is it never matters what's in those minutes"
"3930980","3932760"," because those minutes are fucking huge."
"3933520","3934920"," It's what they focus on. "
"3935520","3938280"," You'll see two kinds of information."
"3938400","3940740"," You'll see a bull or a bear."
"3941400","3942340"," It doesn't matter. "
"3942840","3948920"," We'll try to push what's in the FMC Minutes, but then you'll see the real news come out and they'll"
"3948920","3951400"," highlight what matters in the FMC Minutes."
"3951980","3958220"," Typically, the information is known before FMC, and that is the information that is released to the"
"3958220","3959520"," news to push and pump."
"3960180","3967520"," So whatever they release today, they'll have a presser that they hand out to the press and"
"3967520","3971760"," regardless of what you read inside the FMC Minutes, they're going to tell you what's important"
"3971760","3973260"," inside of the FMC Minutes. "
"3974540","3980640"," And we will normally get that information prior to the rest, most of the market from trade the"
"3980640","3980780"," news."
"3980980","3986700"," Trade the news should typically release that news before you ever see it on Twitter by at least a"
"3986700","3987520"," minute or two."
"3988080","3991960"," You should have that information today before most people on social media. "
"3992580","3993060"," Not everybody."
"3993700","3995640"," Faster than a fucking Bloomberg terminal."
"3995820","3996420"," I promise you that. "
"3996660","4000900"," So Bloomberg terminal news is pretty fucking slow."
"4001460","4006760"," So we'll wait to see what that is."
"4006960","4008060"," That's going to be the move for today. "
"4008360","4013160"," If I had to guess, they're going to trap bulls and bears all day long into the 1230 hour."
"4014400","4015140"," That's my guess."
"4021440","4022780"," Now there'll be nothing telegraph. "
"4022980","4028420"," They're going to be, I promise you, I've traded these minutes more times than I can count."
"4029600","4031140"," And they trap everybody."
"4031680","4033220"," Every single time they trap everybody. "
"4033800","4035420"," And they fucking burn one side."
"4035560","4037180"," Wherever the heaviest side is, they burn them."
"4037820","4039860"," And then they force you to buy more in that direction. "
"4040760","4045720"," If it goes in that direction, most times it's gone in the opposite direction every time without any"
"4045720","4046500"," kind of jankiness."
"4047060","4049400"," If everybody's on the call side, they dump it."
"4050080","4052640"," And if everybody's on the put side, they rip it. "
"4052960","4054680"," And they just make up some bullshit news."
"4056500","4057840"," Tell you why it's dumping or ripping."
"4058580","4063780"," This has been, I think I'm like, I'm thinking I'm like 10 for 10 on these trades. "
"4064380","4065840"," I don't think I've lost a single one yet."
"4066380","4070660"," That's how consistent it is on minutes and on the FOMC."
"4071440","4073720"," Typically you won't see them move until the second day. "
"4073720","4077020"," But the minutes usually get a reaction right away."
"4078740","4084340"," Usually on the FOMC meeting the trade is before leading up to it."
"4084460","4087440"," And then you have to wait usually a day for a reaction. "
"4088340","4093160"," But the minutes students usually write like a half an hour before you'll see a reaction."
"4099120","4100300"," Yeah, they are scam artists."
"4103050","4106210"," Yeah, I saw that rally last night in European session. "
"4106910","4108210"," I saw that US futures rally."
"4109370","4111870"," And dude, I get the bear at the bull case."
"4112350","4114210"," So if you want to be a bull in this market, right?"
"4114790","4117010"," You guys can just look at how this is right now, right?"
"4117970","4119490"," You everybody's loaded up on calls. "
"4120770","4125310"," There's a claim that the advances versus the clienters."
"4125330","4127109"," We have more advances in the clienters."
"4139649","4144970"," I think this is the identity so I call it all to the categories. "
"4151210","4159890"," Tesla calls February 25th, 900 C bull calls, 868,000 dollars."
"4161810","4163250"," More calls on airlines."
"4163810","4165430"," So maybe something's going on and we'll look at our jets. "
"4165670","4166410"," I'm going to look at jets."
"4167510","4174330"," There's calls on BA, there's calls on United Airlines, there's calls on American Airlines."
"4175170","4177830"," We know there's sellers hiding above right on these tickers. "
"4178630","4179890"," We already looked at them on book map."
"4180670","4186149"," But there are calls on United Airlines, February 18th, 50 C for $100,000."
"4186930","4191670"," There's calls on American Airlines, April 14th, 80 C for $300,000. "
"4193010","4194190"," It just came out."
"4196410","4200270"," It's possible if we had some news that there's no war."
"4200410","4205670"," Maybe we don't know about that or there's more flights reopening or something like that. "
"4207610","4215530"," We also have calls on M March 18th, 33 C,"
"4215830","4224430"," $122,000, $34,000, and $353,000, all with a high algo score."
"4227920","4230480"," Look at M for Macy's."
"4231680","4233420"," I like that trade to an extent. "
"4234340","4236460"," You guys probably want to take a look at Macy's."
"4237320","4240040"," The nice turn on Macy's two days ago."
"4241020","4242180"," Look at Macy's next. "
"4245020","4250660"," Open up a chart on your end for the Macy's trade."
"4256470","4258830"," One, two, yeah, it's kind of bullish."
"4260150","4261750"," Not going to lie, Macy's kind of bullish. "
"4262270","4269610"," Looking at one month chart, it looks like a consolidation for a move higher for a conviction trade."
"4269890","4270690"," So we'll look at Macy's."
"4271630","4272570"," The bad looking trade. "
"4279110","4280550"," Maybe they're good ER or something coming out."
"4284710","4285530"," Squeeze play maybe."
"4289690","4290390"," Looks like a squeeze play. "
"4292970","4294490"," Real buyers are down at 22."
"4296490","4298610"," intraday support at 2616."
"4300270","4308470"," Trying to trade above 2730 for a move to 2782 and ultimately 2978. "
"4318050","4319610"," More buyers than sellers."
"4319950","4322470"," They've already touched once down below here at 2707."
"4327020","4328800"," intraday support at 2603. "
"4334040","4335340"," That's interesting here."
"4336360","4337880"," We got some news coming out."
"4338520","4341780"," I don't know enough about why it's trading higher like this and why people are interested in calls. "
"4342920","4344500"," Calls on Google."
"4345280","4352360"," Someone was looking at Google on a squeeze tool this morning at Google."
"4352740","4358260"," March 18, 2900c for $700,000 Apple calls, big calls on Apple. "
"4359560","4363000"," March 11, 165c for $833,000."
"4363840","4367800"," Apple calls March 11, 175c for $200,000."
"4368240","4375340"," Upstart calls, UPST, July 15, 280c for $71,000. "
"4376420","4381660"," Upstart calls February 18, 150c for $282,000."
"4382400","4386720"," Look at the daily line up here and see where all the concentrations are."
"4388700","4391420"," We have four orders for Apple for 1.3 million. "
"4393000","4394660"," Facebook's got by the Dippers in it."
"4394660","4397120"," Baba has a million dollar order on it."
"4399420","4404220"," 916, September 16, 125c. "
"4405360","4408220"," Then Tesla, the 9WM, then upstart, then Google."
"4409100","4410140"," Then the queues."
"4411720","4413620"," M, then a bunch of airlines. "
"4414420","4416220"," Some snap calls as well."
"4417160","4419220"," Snap February 18, 39c."
"4420060","4427320"," A pair of them on sweeps for a total of $330,000. "
"4429740","4432360"," See if we can find anything else that looks interesting."
"4436680","4441480"," BBIG, BA has a small amount of calls."
"4441870","4448460"," We also have calls on PCG, Papa Charlie Gamma, PCG. "
"4449720","4457240"," March 18, 11c for $31,000 and March 18, 13c for $11,000."
"4457640","4467390"," Unusual calls on"
"4467390","4467870"," SOFI."
"4469310","4472110"," February 18, 13c for $22,000. "
"4482140","4483000"," It's a trap."
"4487030","4490090"," Here are indicators going nice and green here on SOFI."
"4492340","4497660"," Back here at a nice crossover at 1020. "
"4499960","4501080"," And up nice and green."
"4501400","4503260"," Here are indicators starting to turn positive here."
"4513810","4515750"," Ooh, I like seeing that Viacom down there. "
"4515850","4516790"," I'm going to look up Viacom next."
"4517030","4519950"," We're going to take a look at Viacom and see where Real Support lies on it."
"4520670","4523050"," I really want some capitulation move. "
"4524550","4529410"," And look for some three-month-out calls on them."
"4546080","4557200"," I don't think there's an add-on for Hero Nvidia calls."
"4557720","4559220"," That's the thing, the third set. "
"4559880","4562640"," February 18, 260c PR trade."
"4563020","4564920"," They report tomorrow, I believe, after the bow."
"4570880","4572140"," I love Viacom's negative. "
"4573280","4574220"," I love buying this dip."
"4576260","4578540"," Look at those buyers down there."
"4579580","4580780"," These weak sellers. "
"4582160","4584080"," Those big buyers just come in."
"4586280","4588140"," See if they think it's going down any deeper."
"4589260","4589360"," Nope. "
"4590400","4595560"," This is exactly where there's the wall accumulation here."
"4596420","4597760"," Just a straight wall."
"4598000","4598300"," Look at it. "
"4598900","4600080"," 70,000 buyers here, right?"
"4600280","4601720"," And you got 66,000."
"4603140","4604920"," Possibly trade down to $25."
"4606200","4606940"," Doesn't matter. "
"4608900","4613360"," What you need to do is let this expiry, let's look at the expiry on Viacom."
"4614880","4622500"," So the key would be to get this expiry in Viacom."
"4622880","4625260"," What you want to do is you want to crush the bull's spirit. "
"4626740","4628180"," You want to destroy the bulls."
"4628820","4631980"," So the bulls are on 30c right now."
"4632480","4635040"," And they're all like, oh please please go back up. "
"4635040","4636120"," I just want to print my calls."
"4636900","4640220"," Oh, I just want to save my calls that I got for ER."
"4640940","4642600"," Please, please, please in reality. "
"4643380","4645260"," I'm going to burn these calls down to the dust."
"4645920","4647240"," I'm not the reality."
"4647440","4651380"," Hopefully they get ground down to the dust into February 18th, right?"
"4651620","4657420"," So what you do is like on Friday or on Tuesday because you know we're closed on Monday, right?"
"4658280","4661140"," You know, the market is closed on Monday. "
"4663240","4666720"," But what you want to do is see like all these calls get destroyed."
"4667700","4674320"," You want the bulls who is all hope, doom and gloom, right?"
"4675080","4680780"," And then you want to like look out like three months of a look from February, right?"
"4681040","4688700"," February, March and April, say May, June, it's even nice to like June 17th."
"4691520","4693980"," Yeah, like you see these calls down here in June. "
"4694620","4697640"," A nice round number."
"4698080","4699420"," So there's someone's playing this with me."
"4699660","4700460"," I didn't know who he is. "
"4701040","4702940"," I knew he was playing this with me."
"4714140","4723860"," So like people are loading up on like there's some dirt bag out there with June 17th,"
"4723960","4726000"," 50c, 13 cents."
"4729080","4733080"," Perfect strike because if it goes to 90, what's what does that pay off?"
"4733260","4733760"," Let's look at it. "
"4734680","4735300"," Look and see."
"4735560","4736520"," Someone's out there gabbling."
"4739160","4740180"," Look up what I would. "
"4740420","4742240"," We're not going to include the premium, right?"
"4742860","4744360"," Or the interest in those calls."
"4745740","4749260"," Let me take a look here."
"4751680","4752340"," Someone's out there. "
"4752500","4754200"," Someone's out there a little with the wrong trade."
"4754500","4758140"," Where's the options profit calculator?"
"4759480","4761620"," That's plus 1.1 million barrels."
"4761900","4763680"," Yeah, see minus 1.3 million. "
"4763860","4765560"," That's like minus 1.6 million barrels."
"4765820","4773540"," You don't see it dropping 2.5% or 75.3%. Clicking through the deploy down to 1.9 million"
"4773540","4774660"," barrels at 25."
"4775060","4778280"," USO with a bid ticker USO. "
"4778980","4782300"," I don't think that's a production flat at 11.6 million."
"4789980","4799970"," It calls on XPO, March 18th, 72 "
"4799970","4803710",".5, C, $300,000."
"4818390","4819550"," That's a good Viacom. "
"4820270","4825470"," And we're going to look at the option for June 17th."
"4840840","4842000"," And let's see."
"4842280","4844680"," Hold on here, I got to do some math. "
"4851380","4852260"," So you ready?"
"4854920","4856840"," Don't follow me on this shit, okay?"
"4857800","4859460"," But this is what someone's out there."
"4859660","4863260"," This is what I had a discussion with with a trader out there back in December."
"4864960","4869780"," So you've got June 17th, $50 calls on Viacom. "
"4870500","4872080"," Now you roll these out every three months."
"4873740","4874980"," So 100 contracts."
"4875220","4876640"," This is, I shouldn't be telling you guys this. "
"4877000","4881500"," So let's say you buy 100 contracts every three months."
"4881700","4884480"," You buy 100 contracts way outside the money calls."
"4886460","4894480"," For this example, you've got 100 contracts that cost you $1300, right?"
"4894720","4896340"," I know you guys lose $1300 all the time. "
"4896900","4898720"," So that's cost $1300, right?"
"4899880","4909600"," If there was a, if there was a merger, and we trade it to $70, in this time frame, you'd"
"4909600","4911220"," make about $200,000."
"4911540","4913560"," This is old school Wall Street bets, just so you know."
"4914240","4916020"," This is old school Wall Street bets. "
"4917280","4922060"," If it went to 90, you'd make $400,000 in that trade."
"4924060","4930720"," You'd have to, you'd probably have to set an alert, like all Viacom news come to your phone, so"
"4930720","4931860"," that you could sell those calls."
"4932160","4936020"," The moment that a merger or acquisition was announced. "
"4936540","4942460"," But for a thousand bucks, I bet you have a better chance of that, of trading that for four quarters"
"4942460","4945880"," than you do of winning the lottery."
"4947940","4950300"," You make that trade for four straight quarters."
"4953440","4955700"," Probably gonna get in trouble telling people this. "
"4958540","4964320"," So the Viacom trade would be, and that doesn't mean it's gonna happen, but there's a huge trade out"
"4964320","4964540"," there."
"4964900","4967620"," I know you guys pissed money away all the time, so let's say you make a big win."
"4968300","4972300"," Take a grand, and you throw them on some outside the money calls on Viacom. "
"4973280","4974500"," And that doesn't include premium."
"4975120","4977420"," Just the fucking premium kick would be insane."
"4980380","4982460"," You make a lot of money. "
"4984060","4986320"," That's a nice round number, too, like 50 bucks."
"4990220","4991280"," Here's another example."
"4992040","4999360"," If you only hit 50 between now and like me, you would make $50,000 in that trade. "
"5001440","5002640"," Oh, good question."
"5002800","5003800"," Why not just do leaps?"
"5004240","5005300"," I'm gonna explain it to you why."
"5006720","5016600"," If I spend $1,000 four times, I spend $1,000 four times, my payout"
"5016600","5018040"," is much larger than leaps. "
"5019160","5020460"," No one cares about leaps."
"5022560","5026560"," Only thing people care about is what is gonna happen now."
"5030440","5033420"," Well, that's the good way to ask a good question, right?"
"5034420","5040340"," So I'm gonna, I want to answer this question for a lot of you out there, and that is that"
"5040340","5043420"," with any trade, there's risk. "
"5044140","5052780"," So you have to do your own due diligence and say, what are the chances of larger or"
"5052780","5056780"," companies on the rise acquiring other companies, right?"
"5057520","5060100"," Like which companies would want to acquire another company?"
"5060460","5061400"," What are the reasons for that?"
"5062320","5064320"," If you get calls on, I'm gonna answer that question in a second."
"5064320","5073920"," TD, TTD, so Tango, Tango Delta, February 18, 74C, three sweeps, 26,000, 57,000, 78,000, February"
"5073920","5076520"," 18, 74C, TTD."
"5076900","5085860"," Facebook puts February 18, 215P, SPXS, July 15, 27,"
"5086340","5094440"," 26C, $207,000, loads of Apple calls coming in right now, off the chain that BA calls to February"
"5094440","5098340"," 18, 220C for $75,000, but bang in on Apple calls. "
"5099120","5102880"," I got one, two, three, four, five, six, look at Apple right away."
"5103800","5105460"," This is the market warning for a positive."
"5106200","5115480"," Apple February 18, 172.5C, $41,000, Apple March 11, 165C, $833,000, Apple"
"5115480","5125160"," March 11, 165C, $882,000, Apple golden ticket, March 11, 165C, $1 "
"5125160","5135140",".6 million, Apple March 11, 165C, $800,000, calls on SPY for a sister for a"
"5135140","5145720"," pear trade, I guess, February 16, 445C, Apple February 16, 447C, $30,000, we're"
"5145720","5147460"," going to answer that question, that's a good question. "
"5148320","5150420"," Why would I, why would I trade?"
"5150740","5158780"," We're going to look at Apple 2 on book map, big money coming into Apple currently."
"5159980","5161200"," Apple trade down 170."
"5162780","5165260"," So we're going to tell them, well, like, well, how do you come to that?"
"5165500","5171600"," The first of all, you can't ask me or anybody that question, why do you think that's going to"
"5171600","5171840"," happen?"
"5171840","5177580"," You have to go and do your own due diligence, and you, as a trader, as an investor, have to"
"5177580","5179340"," see if you have that conviction or not. "
"5180200","5184420"," It's not up to me to tell you, hey, you should buy Palantare because of this and because of that."
"5185040","5186860"," You have to say, well, why is he saying that?"
"5186960","5188320"," Why is this trade so lucrative?"
"5189320","5190900"," And I have to look into this, right?"
"5191300","5194140"," So in a key example of this, though, would be Peloton, right?"
"5194360","5197800"," Peton's out there, and someone wants that badge, right?"
"5197920","5202640"," We know somebody wants the Peton badge, regardless if they're going to sell or not, then you know,"
"5202780","5207320"," someone's going to want to roll that badge into their products category, their basket, or whatever."
"5208080","5214660"," And so you're looking right now, and for me, I know that people are not watching TV anymore. "
"5214960","5218120"," I know that people aren't watching cable TV anymore."
"5218360","5226880"," I know that kids and young adults are focused on Hulu, they're focused on Roku, and Apple TV, and"
"5226880","5228100"," Netflix."
"5228740","5234740"," And I know, being, you know, young enough to end with kids, that there's content limitations. "
"5235240","5239480"," When you see a company like Netflix say, hey, we're only going to run a show for one to three"
"5239480","5244940"," seasons and then run a different show, it only has to do with one thing."
"5245460","5248300"," And it has to do with the fact that they're trying to build content."
"5248880","5253360"," They want to like build stranger things, set it down for a little while, come back to it in five"
"5253360","5253920"," or 10 years. "
"5254500","5256720"," It's a property that they've developed."
"5257260","5260900"," And people complain all the time, hey, Netflix doesn't have any content, right?"
"5260900","5265040"," So now they've got German content, Korean content, anywhere they can get content."
"5265720","5270940"," But in reality, they want to have their own, like, like, fake like our, like our Netflix produced"
"5270940","5271440"," this. "
"5272060","5276920"," We look forward to seeing this show, and they have it in their stable, right?"
"5277220","5283540"," So a company like Viacom is famous for making TV content over the past 10, 20 years, or whatever,"
"5283880","5284560"," even longer, right?"
"5285200","5287480"," And they have these, they have all these properties."
"5288040","5290680"," An example would be, let's say they owned friends, right?"
"5291200","5295220"," Not that they do, but if they had owned friends, they could say, hey, we're going to relaunch"
"5295220","5298180"," friends again on our network, or we own friends, right?"
"5298320","5302440"," So let's say Roku required it and say, hey, we're going to relaunch, relaunch friends."
"5303180","5309620"," And because they bought Viacom, they can, they can play that show on their platform, right, on"
"5309620","5310160"," their channel. "
"5311340","5318200"," And so if you're a Roku, or if you're a Hulu, or if you're Netflix, you're an Amazon TV, you"
"5318200","5320580"," want to gain the rights to those properties."
"5320760","5325960"," And if there are companies out there that are looking very weak, Viacom is on that list."
"5326640","5329600"," Now, they're not the only ones on that list, but they're definitely on that list. "
"5329800","5335360"," If I was a headhunter out there looking to snipe and take, take a property, properties from a"
"5335360","5338800"," company, I would have Viacom on my list and be like, you know what, I'm going to buy that company."
"5339400","5341520"," I'm going to take all those properties and roll them into my channel."
"5342260","5346720"," And all I got to do is find somebody with a bunch of money to help me do a takeover. "
"5347040","5348160"," So I'm going to start a short operation."
"5348660","5350680"," I'm going to beat the shit out of the stock, right?"
"5350800","5354120"," I'm going to pay this government official off with a ruined Viacom."
"5354440","5356320"," I'm going to make everybody out there think it sucks. "
"5356880","5358100"," And then I'm going to do a corporate takeover."
"5358300","5359540"," I'm going to accumulate all that stock."
"5360000","5362460"," And then one day I'm going to announce and say, hey, we're buying Viacom. "
"5363080","5371960"," So in my view, as a trader, in my research, I think that Viacom is a prime candidate for a"
"5371960","5373560"," takeover or a merger down the road."
"5373720","5375540"," Now, does it guarantee that it happens?"
"5375680","5377520"," No, and there's nothing guaranteed in this world."
"5377540","5379760"," You can't guarantee that it's going to happen. "
"5379960","5384820"," But if it does happen, right, and we come back here to discuss this in a year or two, or"
"5384820","5389620"," you don't see me ever again, I disappear with my, with my glasses and my mustache on like some of"
"5389620","5390460"," these pumpers out there."
"5391560","5392740"," You're like, damn it."
"5393000","5399580"," Captain Jim always told me to buy all these crazy outside the money calls on Viacom. "
"5400400","5402420"," You know, piss away four grand."
"5402600","5404420"," And you know, the funniest part about this trade, right?"
"5404840","5412140"," Is I know, I guarantee that 80% of you out there would say, I know that 80% of"
"5412140","5414160"," you would be like, oh, fuck no, I'm making that trade."
"5414460","5420580"," And next week, you'll trade some spy or some apple or some fucking AMC and lose four or five grand"
"5420580","5422400"," and think nothing of it. "
"5422700","5426020"," I think nothing of losing that money."
"5426700","5428360"," And you'd be like, oh, good luck to our next time."
"5428360","5429540"," I'll get them, right?"
"5429980","5432040"," But tell most people, this is what I mean again. "
"5432160","5436220"," That's why I don't recommend you trade this because it's a losing trade unless it prints."
"5436920","5440260"," So you have to, you have to say to yourself that thousand bucks is gone."
"5440920","5442340"," Like I never get that money back. "
"5442580","5443740"," It's never coming back to me."
"5445200","5448540"," But the payoff on that trade is stupid huge."
"5448980","5454220"," If you guys get a better trade than that, let me know because to me, that's my trade of the"
"5454220","5454380"," year. "
"5454380","5460700"," I don't think, let's even look at like, you guys are like, oh, I want to buy hood, right?"
"5461200","5462620"," You know what you need to have happen for hood?"
"5463340","5466040"," You need to have Vlad step off."
"5466720","5471760"," And he just reaffirmed in his last year, he said, fuck you, I ain't going nowhere."
"5472480","5474400"," I own this company, right?"
"5474720","5476300"," Nobody doing a hustle take over this company. "
"5476840","5481240"," Have they released like an entry level charting software or maybe like Weevil or something?"
"5481740","5482180"," Like just basic?"
"5482180","5483280"," Fuck no."
"5483640","5486240"," People are out there saying, oh, it's going to be taken over."
"5486360","5486800"," He's going to solve. "
"5487000","5488220"," He's going to do this and there's going to be that."
"5488560","5494100"," If you want to look someone on their last leg, I'd take a Viacom in their last leg over a"
"5494100","5495340"," Robinhood on their last leg."
"5496720","5497220"," All right. "
"5497340","5498660"," So I hear all those arguments out there."
"5502540","5504760"," Oh, I have 100% degree."
"5504880","5505620"," That's binary event. "
"5505780","5514160"," I want the thesis has to be is Viacom going to be acquiesced or emerged into another company."
"5514160","5520980"," So if you believe that or believe that that is a high possibility of that happening, you have to do"
"5520980","5521680"," your own due diligence."
"5521680","5526420"," You have to look into it because I've done mine and I think that that is on the table. "
"5527080","5533640"," Now, and even some high rollers have said that as well, but they haven't named the companies that"
"5533640","5534320"," are on that block."
"5535840","5538160"," And I just personally, I believe Viacom is."
"5539140","5540420"," So I don't want to hear. "
"5540520","5542120"," I know you guys piss away money all day long."
"5542120","5546680"," And I want to hear that you don't want to piss away $4,000 because I know you piss away"
"5546680","5551280"," for a grand all the time, all the time on shittier plays."
"5552820","5554860"," Anyways, I'll move on from that rant. "
"5555780","5564420"," Spy calls, February 16th, 445 C $63,000, Apple calls, Apple's moving up to, by the way, it's"
"5564420","5565280"," bouncing off right here."
"5565660","5567960"," We'll put up the hero indicator."
"5569460","5573460"," Sometimes it'll dip or move up on a big trades like that. "
"5575000","5576860"," So, but it looks like we can go on a chart."
"5577020","5577360"," It looks great."
"5581140","5582840"," Yes, I always hear that from people. "
"5582940","5584660"," They're like, eh, you don't know if it's going to happen."
"5585240","5589720"," I'm like, shit, you guys take trades on fucking many, all kinds of nonsense tickers out there, and"
"5589720","5590280"," it never happens."
"5594380","5596420"," No, my target is that they get acquired. "
"5596760","5603460"," So if they're trading at 30 bucks, if there is an announcement, you'd see a spike up to probably at"
"5603460","5604120"," least 70."
"5605340","5606580"," I'm not even looking for 50."
"5606840","5608040"," I'm looking for 70 or 90. "
"5611460","5612820"," You guys are like, I hate you."
"5616220","5617380"," You're welcome, son."
"5618320","5619160"," I love you too, Josh. "
"5623760","5627700"," Pain on B.A. puts me up on 40."
"5629680","5631560"," It's 40k like I'm weekly is done."
"5632460","5633980"," No, no, no, no. "
"5634720","5636040"," Hey, how are you?"
"5639700","5644360"," Yeah, my putting the trade is the trade is the pissed away $1,000 every quarter."
"5645880","5648280"," And it's a $4,000 trade, let's say."
"5648780","5652940"," It should print to you anywhere from $50,000 to $400,000. "
"5656520","5659740"," If you hold the viewpoint that Viacom's going to merge."
"5663090","5665830"," But I didn't have to admit, this is an old school Wall Street bets play."
"5665830","5668290"," Like this is the, this is some shit that you'd find involved. "
"5668470","5669990"," Not now you wouldn't find it on Wall Street bets."
"5670410","5673710"," But back in the fucking day, this is a trade that you'd find on Wall Street bets."
"5676600","5686580"," Apple's now moving up $170.97. Apple's trading higher here in Decatur's"
"5686580","5688000"," green, more sellers than buyers. "
"5688620","5690600"," I'm going to assume that the sellers are freaking out right now."
"5691080","5698420"," It's going to be a good, uh, a good squeeze play here if they can get above $170 to $39."
"5699060","5701600"," If I was short Apple right now, I'd be kind of, kind of worried. "
"5703080","5706620"," Not too many sellers until you get above here to $176."
"5710510","5714550"," Cap is just front loading, pumping his front loaded Viacom calls."
"5715790","5724020"," Ah, Winky doesn't like me pumping his stock. "
"5727940","5728720"," Trust me."
"5729320","5730420"," Trust me, it's a good play."
"5730820","5737860"," I ran this trade against somebody that I trust, a very well-known trader, very well-known trader I"
"5737860","5741500"," ran against last December, early December. "
"5742460","5747580"," And as a matter of fact, when we took that trade in early December, it printed fucking fat."
"5751400","5754500"," So, it's now back down trading down to its board level."
"5754700","5757780"," So if you guys want a winner, it's already printed once. "
"5757780","5760540"," That hasn't printed that big, but it's printed nicely."
"5761820","5763920"," So, you know, it's a gamble."
"5764560","5765700"," It's a pure fucking gamble. "
"5766000","5769000"," But I'll tell you what, there ain't no fucking spy calls out there they're going to print to."
"5769760","5773100"," I can do, I don't even know what the percentage win on that is anymore, I didn't look."
"5774060","5779940"," But I'm assuming that the percentage win on it is like, you know, 100,000% or something stupid. "
"5780940","5781620"," I don't know what it is."
"5782160","5782860"," It's in the thousands."
"5783540","5785760"," It's in the multi-multi-multi-multi-thousands. "
"5786780","5789160"," And that this is not financial advice."
"5789720","5792460"," Do not listen to anything I'm telling you about this."
"5793940","5795620"," Do not take my advice. "
"5796120","5797660"," Do not buy Viacom."
"5798620","5800560"," Do not follow me on that trade."
"5804700","5808900"," But the truth is, the truth is for me, do some due diligence. "
"5810120","5815040"," Matter of fact, there's a guy from CNBC that mentioned a prediction about that this year."
"5816040","5817720"," I don't think Viacom is buying anybody."
"5818280","5819920"," Like, nobody gives a fuck about Viacom. "
"5821140","5824160"," You're not going to be like, oh yeah, you guys are in Viacom every month?"
"5824900","5826660"," Like, nobody's about there getting Viacom."
"5827000","5831720"," They're like rolling between Apple, Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, talking with their friends, the water"
"5831720","5831960"," cooler."
"5833260","5835940"," Fucking HBO, whatever fucking is, it's out there you're watching. "
"5837120","5840060"," But no one's being, no one's like, you got, I know you guys, none of you guys have friends and"
"5840060","5842280"," they're like, hey, did you send them for Viacom this month?"
"5842820","5843980"," You know, there's none of that going on."
"5844600","5849040"," Viacom is part of a dying breed and it's eventually going to get sold out."
"5849040","5852380"," Or my view, it's going to get sold out and part it out to the highest better. "
"5853160","5855980"," Whatever ruthless shark out there is going to get them for the best price."
"5863080","5867580"," Red saying he heard that on radio Apple patent for car dash screen was filed, they would have to"
"5867580","5871300"," partner up with the car manufacturer and presume that's anyone here with this shit."
"5871820","5875540"," It also could be a trade into the sell the news Apple event that's coming up. "
"5879270","5881250"," I missed the Viacom trade suggestion."
"5892070","5899070"," Yeah, their content is big, like they have their content is outstanding, ripe for the picking."
"5899770","5909730"," You know, if I owned a hulu and I saw their stock price down at 28 bucks, it's"
"5909730","5910890"," a juicy, you know, it's juicy. "
"5912390","5914070"," It's juicy to make an offer on that."
"5914170","5915330"," You don't even need the offer to go through."
"5915910","5920010"," All you need is the offer to be made public and that stock is going to the moon. "
"5921390","5922590"," Go into the moon."
"5925510","5927390"," They counted with a reverse mortgage."
"5932450","5934070"," So not financial advice. "
"5934070","5938670"," Apple ripping higher right now keeps printing called out Apple calls 10 minutes ago."
"5939150","5941070"," Apple calls move on the move going up."
"5945240","5946900"," Spy just trapping buyers. "
"5947540","5949040"," Spy is just scooping them in."
"5949600","5950380"," Come join the party."
"5950680","5951340"," You guys want some calls?"
"5951660","5952220"," Who wants some puts?"
"5953200","5953700"," You want some puts?"
"5954000","5954520"," Who wants some calls?"
"5954980","5955480"," Jump on in. "
"5956340","5960180"," Fucking Apple is moving like my fucking, I don't want to say it."
"5960580","5970550"," I know, I know who stands is the water cooler."
"5974610","5977110"," I know who the wave acquired and shit. "
"5981320","5982500"," I hate hulu."
"5983320","5984860"," They fucked that all up, right?"
"5985200","5986020"," What if YouTube bought it?"
"5986300","5991040"," If YouTube bought Viacom's content for YouTube TV, there's some buyers out there for sure."
"5993360","6002320"," Exp calls high algo score 240 C, $83,000 till Ray"
"6002320","6007560"," March 4th, $8c, $21,000 high algo score hook. "
"6008520","6012740"," February 18th, 2.5c for $16,000 high algo score."
"6013100","6014300"," Second calls on hook."
"6014860","6017480"," February 18th, 2.5c, $22,000. "
"6017860","6023640"," You know, some firm calls just came in and I noticed someone was looking at a squeeze thing this"
"6023640","6026520"," morning on a firm, on a discord that I'm in."
"6027400","6028480"," We're going to look at a firm."
"6029240","6030320"," See if it's squeezable. "
"6031780","6034080"," I think somewhere was talking about that early this morning."
"6037530","6039930"," Hero indicator moving on up on the spy."
"6041010","6042610"," The spy trading is slightly higher. "
"6044330","6049370"," 44.3.52, let's say it's in a bear flag right now, just heads up on that."
"6050510","6056550"," If the bulls can't put it together on the spy, you will see another drop."
"6057450","6059510"," So we'll look higher here and see if any sellers step in. "
"6061740","6065560"," Let's see if there's any, any, any anything sneaky pizza above."
"6066900","6072080"," Right here at 447.29. This is nice to see by the way."
"6072680","6074180"," We didn't have these sellers here before. "
"6075520","6078820"," We didn't see the sellers that high yesterday."
"6079740","6080340"," That's interesting."
"6081920","6083680"," We haven't seen those sellers there. "
"6085100","6086400"," That is interesting."
"6087420","6091140"," We didn't see the sellers move that high until today."
"6092080","6093380"," They weren't there yesterday. "
"6093380","6095980"," They were down on 445, I believe."
"6096600","6097700"," See this right here?"
"6098020","6099460"," We didn't have these sellers there before."
"6101620","6102180"," Interesting. "
"6105660","6108240"," calls on Tesla, Tesla."

"6135050","6137110"," So Jess called that rocket launch on Tesla."
"6137390","6137870"," Right on, Jess. "
"6138290","6138630"," Good job."
"6141400","6141960"," Weed."
"6145690","6148030"," Spy don't give a fuck about Tesla mooning. "
"6148510","6151930"," I know they're pinning, so they pin spy yesterday too."
"6152370","6155230"," As the market moves, they pin spy intentionally."
"6155950","6158910"," There are shit tons of shorts on the spy right now. "
"6167890","6177330"," More affirm calls, February 18, 42.5. There's Jets."

"6186050","6189990"," Jets is now up from 2320 at the open to 2370."
"6193710","6196870"," Those tickers on book map looked like they were squeezable."
"6197390","6198730"," They had lots of sellers above. "
"6199870","6202210"," So if they get higher, they could squeeze."

"6259020","6263880"," If any good news comes out of those minutes, we're going to get a fucking rocket ship."
"6266080","6266600"," Guaranteed."
"6267560","6271740"," Any good news comes out of those minutes, and spy is going to fly. "

"6376350","6377610"," Tesla's been pretty good trade."
"6378570","6383830"," If you're buying the 850s and 900s and trading up to 9 to 35, 950 tests has been pretty consistent"

"6414150","6415330"," And just infuriating investors."
"6415910","6421930"," So we'll look at Tesla, we'll let that speed itself up. "
"6424510","6426010"," Just getting ragdolled."
"6433660","6437800"," Yeah, my trade today is somewhere in the spy trade into the 230 hour."
"6438260","6439380"," I'm not trading anything but spy. "
"6439960","6442340"," That is one key warning to you."
"6443180","6449500"," If you are a stock bull or bear to be conscious of that move at 230, right?"
"6449680","6450840"," You can stay in any trade you want."

"6471820","6474020"," And the upward move is only 450."
"6474880","6477840"," So there's more money on the downward move than there is in the upward move. "
"6478900","6487020"," So if you are a bull, right, have some prophylactics on, what you could do is, let's say you wanted"

"6504760","6505540"," coming out at 230."
"6514940","6515780"," Let's see here. "
"6518320","6525200"," Get yourself some spreads, some far out spreads, get yourself a put back spread, right?"
"6526120","6534100"," So you buy outside the money puts and you sell in the money puts, they pay for themselves."

"6556520","6559000"," believe the bullshit that's coming out at 230. "
"6561140","6563020"," At least put some prophylactics on."

"6694530","6695230"," I can't lie to you. "
"6696250","6698850"," So if you just trade, if you buy below VWAP, it's at 900."

"7489600","7490740"," It looks like a lot of sellers on Google. "
"7491660","7493560"," Maybe there's some news that it hasn't been announced yet."
"7494260","7495140"," Oh, no, there's more buyers."
"7495880","7496560"," Google is nice. "
"7497080","7498300"," I can see why people are buying calls."
"7499680","7502060"," Nice support here in Google, 2700."
"7502740","7505480"," No real sellers until we get way better. "
"7506760","7507320"," Nice."
"7509320","7510140"," That's the car."
"7511300","7513460"," Price target above, 2767. "
"7517060","7521740"," Sully more sellers than buyers, but that could be for all these calls coming in."
"7522320","7524340"," Could just be dealer hedging."
"7528170","7532210"," Slightly negative hero indicator, but the buyers are there without a doubt. "
"7534900","7542580"," If you really wanted to buy the dip or wait to set a snap of line at 2652, that's what"
"7542580","7543300"," the real money is."
"7543720","7563600"," If there's any weakness in Google, I"
"7563600","7564020"," got you guys."
"7564220","7564620"," I got you brothers. "
"7565820","7567000"," It's not really bad news."
"7567440","7568840"," The bad news on, uh-oh."
"7569760","7570760"," Am I still in here?"
"7571260","7573180"," So there's no real bad news. "
"7573640","7576940"," There's satellite images that were released today."
"7578320","7583960"," Stating that, um- Stating that."
"7586060","7588060"," Let's see if we can break above this right here. "
"7588420","7589280"," It's trend line."
"7593850","7596130"," These usually make pretty good shorts, by the way."
"7596610","7598250"," Just heads up to you if you're a trader out there. "
"7598510","7605510"," If you're a new trader, I want you to know that this is going to happen, but if you guys"
"7605510","7606650"," don't know these setups."
"7610910","7614270"," That spy right now is looking like a short."
"7614910","7616030"," Now it doesn't mean it is. "
"7616530","7621370"," A lot of calls coming out on Apple, a lot of calls coming out on QQQs right now, on spy"
"7621370","7621990"," right now."
"7622610","7627030"," But I want you to know that bears are looking at setups like this to short this, or big red"
"7627030","7627570"," bar down."
"7628830","7630290"," To be conscious if you're trading this. "
"7631150","7636230"," Uh, if you're trading the spy here, that bears will be trying to step in at some point."
"7642430","7643530"," Let's be careful here."
"7649700","7651440"," There's a bunch of different hot calls. "
"7651660","7654260"," They will talk about where all the- where all the bulls today."
"7654560","7656080"," You guys might know where the bulls are, where the bears are."
"7657900","7667800"," Bulls are on Apple, Google, Facebook, Tesla, Baba, UPST, Peton, NVIDIA, M,"
"7668600","7676880"," UAL, the airlines and some sympathy plays in the, uh, in the, uh, cruise lines. "
"7677860","7681680"," Somebody play or a sister play or a brother play on the snap."
"7682440","7690770"," Calls on Airbnb, V-Ray, B-A-C had some calls on it."
"7691730","7702830"," Uber, T-T-D, B-A, Ferm, Purple, American Airlines, AMC, EXPE,"
"7704010","7711600"," SOFI, BBIG, Hook, lots of interest there. "
"7726480","7727400"," So that's everything."
"7730410","7733510"," I'm gonna take a quick break here and I'll be back."
"7733510","7742400"," I'm gonna take a break for what's 11.19. I'm gonna take a break for just like 10 minutes until"
"7742400","7748380"," like 11.30. I'm gonna go ahead and, uh, I'm gonna go get a, like, a cup of water or"
"7748380","7748680"," something. "
"7749060","7750940"," So if you guys want to take a break, pick a piss, something like that."
"7751580","7752680"," I'm gonna leave the stream up, of course."
"7753640","7756920"," Uh, looks like some, or a little bit of sellers here on spy. "
"7757720","7759500"," Talked about that just about five minutes ago."
"7760160","7763280"," When you got, you guys should look at the chart on spy right now when you see stuff like this."
"7763840","7766940"," See this, this rising, this rising wedge right here. "
"7768120","7772240"," If those can't put together quickly, uh, it's usually a sell."
"7774720","7775800"," You're a close in 15."
"7777860","7782140"," I don't know how not I agree with you on PTON. "
"7782260","7783640"," PTON's a $10 stock."
"7784220","7784820"," That's what it is."
"7786180","7787640"," I'm sorry, man, that's what it is. "
"7791900","7793320"," Yeah, some weakness in the spy currently."
"7795760","7797960"," I'm gonna bet there's two moves here, right?"
"7798080","7799980"," There's either trade inside of this little box."
"7802160","7804100"," Or, I mean, is that what bulls are doing?"
"7804100","7804980"," Just trading this box?"
"7806220","7811460"," Or is there, because it looks to me like at some point it's gonna, gonna dump. "
"7826240","7828260"," It's like a perfect dump scenario, just so you know."
"7832700","7834800"," All right, so I'll be right back in like just 10 minutes."
"7834800","7839280"," I'm gonna take a quick break and I'll be back for 11.30 for the Euro close. "
"7880900","7886040"," That's catch carry saying the experience with COVID shows that this will be a while before we can"
"7886040","7890620"," be comfortable living with COVID before supply chains come back and before workers on the sideline"
"7890620","7891460"," come back to work."
"7905790","7915550"," MRTX Micro-Mio-Tango X-ray 916, February 16th 136 from $9 million."
"7916010","7922090"," So it's a harker saying that like see 25 biggest points increase in March, not 50. "
"7923130","7928290"," Dip buyers on spy, Palantir, Tesla, and the queues."
"7929910","7935190"," That's harker saying we'll take a couple of years to get back to 2% inflation target in the US."
"7936590","7941350"," The Fed needs to walk a fine line addressing inflation without damaging the economy. "
"7941890","7943110"," Come with some that's harker."
"7945030","7949650"," Catch car goes on to say the Fed can soften demand by raising rates and tightening financial"
"7949650","7952310"," conditions, but that won't address supply side issues."
"7975680","7977840"," Are you guys able to hear that now?"
"7978260","7979240"," Is that still too low?"
"7980660","7983600"," Can you guys actually hear the news feed?"
"7986460","7988200"," Josh, can you hear the news feed fine?"
"7988440","7989600"," Is it louder now?"
"8011000","8011540"," Blies better?"
"8011800","8012000"," All right, good. "
"8012900","8013400"," All right, run them."
"8091870","8095730"," Those uh those MRTX calls were interesting."
"8096810","8101290"," If any of you are uh biotech bulls. "
"8103130","8105090"," MRT, it's MRTX."
"8105330","8106890"," It was trading at 250 bucks."
"8107970","8110150"," It's now trading down at 91, 98. "
"8111770","8115510"," The low on it is 66 dollars."
"8116390","8124950"," Probably just set some alerts on it between here between 90 and 60 bucks, right?"
"8125350","8126870"," 65 bucks, set an alert on it."
"8129230","8132870"," Looks like it's almost finished with its retracement. "
"8133710","8141770"," The calls are MRTX 916 130 C for two million dollars."
"8144580","8146780"," It might be a nice buy and hold."
"8147740","8149920"," Probably do some work on that and check on it. "
"8192910","8198870"," Also Shopify calls April 14th, 1000 C, 250,000 dollars."
"8199150","8203170"," It might make a nice uh spread."
"8203889","8204870"," Not so much just naked. "
"8205530","8210610"," Not naked but you know um single or just uh calls."
"8212950","8220790"," A little shop might be a nice trade for 1000 C on spreads heading out to a June or something"
"8220790","8221430"," like that."
"8221530","8223350"," You know check and see if it's got a dividend or not. "
"8223450","8224290"," I don't know if shops are dividend."
"8224950","8227049"," You don't want to buy spreads or anything with a dividend on it."
"8260639","8263980"," About 90 seconds now 90 seconds from the European cash equity close. "
"8264040","8268740"," The DAX, the cat caron now on the red, the Spanish ibex up two tenths of a percent."
"8269020","8270740"," The foots are 100 down to 10th of a percent."
"8271940","8276080"," Bond yields near the lows of the day as we head out of European cash equity trade. "
"8276780","8280660"," 10-year guilt down sixth despite the inflation data earlier in the session."
"8281480","8283900"," The 10-year boom lower by three basis points."
"8290389","8296830"," Note that uh Walmart bottomed at 132.70 and they're now ripping higher. "
"8297450","8298809"," Calls coming in across the board."
"8299650","8302830"," March 18th, 140 C for 80,000 dollars."
"8303030","8306270"," March 18th, 140 C for 75,000 dollars. "

"8309990","8314250"," All block trades were one uh one sweep and two block trades."
"8316110","8318590"," Again it's March 18th, 140 C."
"8320590","8322650"," I paid $1.49 for those calls. "
"8332969","8335330"," I'll look at Oracle right now in book map if you like."
"8346469","8348650"," I'm gonna take a look at uh Oracle real quick."
"8355459","8357160"," I still haven't taken my break. "
"8357360","8359540"," I was trying to mess with some stuff."
"8359540","8361959"," Take a look at that spot that Walmart chart by the way."
"8362459","8364260"," And I'll bring up the Walmart chart next for you. "
"8372200","8375420"," Real buyers are down below at 420 on Oracle."
"8377020","8378120"," That's where the real money is."
"8378620","8379320"," It's bullish today. "
"8379440","8380459"," There's more buyers and sellers."
"8380760","8382299"," I'm not gonna say that it's not bullish on the day."
"8383440","8385719"," If you find weakness in the market at any point. "
"8386780","8389340"," Remember that 420 uh target."
"8389340","8400380"," If you"
"8400380","8401960"," want to look for a price target for today."
"8405800","8407160"," Some sellers hiding it. "
"8409840","8412140"," The real sellers are hiding at 445."
"8417620","8422550"," Most of them are going to look higher."
"8423490","8424710"," Do you think it's going higher maybe?"
"8426890","8428410"," The seller is at 445. "
"8429430","8439520"," 40 and then 446.09. More"
"8439520","8442440"," sellers at 447.60 and 448."
"8443500","8445140"," Blue skies above it in this black area."
"8445980","8448720"," If you really get above 448 you're going to make a move much higher. "
"8453010","8454510"," Some sellers at 449 and 450."
"8456190","8470910"," The ultimate"
"8470910","8479450"," price target would be 452.60. We'll get the Walmart chart."
"8481150","8485730"," The Walmart's got an ER coming up I think tomorrow. "
"8486630","8488150"," It's been trading down heavy."
"8489230","8490450"," So I used to trade Walmart."
"8490770","8495310"," It's a really weird ticker to trade into their ERs typically. "
"8497550","8500250"," They tend to have distribution like they do right now."
"8500250","8503350"," If they're trading down, Walmart's trading down on the year."
"8504090","8509750"," They've almost given back everything since March 2021. "
"8511130","8514410"," And June see here."
"8516570","8520090"," So let's look back at so basically back in 2020."
"8523630","8525230"," They're trading at like $110. "
"8526590","8527850"," It's a good that's a good trade."
"8527850","8539860"," I mean if you keep an eye on Walmart heading into their ER, it's"
"8539860","8545600"," the best part of Walmart is just owning the stock down here."
"8545940","8548040"," Like before ER owning the stock is good. "
"8548640","8552220"," If it even trades down, let's say it has a bad ER and trades down to 100 bucks."
"8552460","8554040"," You have to add dollar cost average down."
"8555660","8557280"," Walmart's like Amazon, right?"
"8557280","8559640"," It's one of the companies that keeps America running. "
"8561040","8568870"," You can hate Walmart as a company but it's used as a market hedge."
"8571170","8576410"," There's nothing ever wrong with, just think about if you own, if you own Walmart at 100 bucks or"
"8576410","8582410"," 130 bucks and you add dollar cost average in and you just sell puts down at $80 on Walmart, you're"
"8582410","8582890"," going to make money."
"8585440","8592210"," Take a look at the Walmart chart on a two year cycle over the course of two years. "
"8594050","8600650"," Almost done, not quite, but almost done given the red list of rest of its money back."
"8601870","8609810"," It'd be better to buy Walmart at like 118 bucks or 110, $100 but it's starting to get to that"
"8609810","8610130"," point."
"8610470","8610990"," Keep an eye on it. "
"8611050","8617730"," I wouldn't say buy it today but I would keep an eye on it between now and Friday and not"
"8617730","8618730"," Friday, Thursday I believe."
"8618870","8621130"," I don't know when they're here as I think it's Thursday."
"8621890","8627350"," But keep an eye on it as it trades into, and what's really weird about Walmart is even if it"
"8627350","8630210"," misses, it gets scooped right back up. "
"8630410","8633490"," So let's say trades down, it gets accumulated by banks."
"8635910","8638970"," It might even be a trade that you wait for after you are on."
"8639150","8643190"," Maybe there's a dump like one last capitulation dump but it's worth watching. "
"8643550","8649470"," Either way, we'll keep your eyes on Walmart and even when they beat, sometimes they don't trade"
"8649470","8652870"," higher in print until an expiration or two later."
"8653130","8655350"," They're a really good company to buy spreads on."
"8655670","8658270"," Like in the money call spreads or slightly under the money call spreads. "
"8659070","8660490"," So they could be like a fishing expedition."
"8660890","8665990"," They have a bad ER, they trade down $10, $20 and then it gets all scooped back up and then"
"8665990","8667550"," it trades back up again over time."
"8669470","8671950"," I like want the Walmart trade right now, believe it or not. "
"8671950","8678250"," I don't know, I'm not sure I'm willing to buy it at $130 but it's getting close, man."
"8678450","8684550"," It's getting down like you see Walmart at $125 or $110 or $90 or anything like that."
"8684650","8688590"," Josh Curry repeating that we'll be watching the data over the next six months to make sure"
"8688590","8690610"," inflation is going in the right direction. "
"8698170","8699930"," Hotches like I'm under water in my shares."
"8701510","8708530"," It's Walmart, take a look at the Walmart trade or the Walmart chart below the last two years."
"8710290","8713290"," The problem is it's hard to trade options on Walmart though. "
"8714310","8715930"," It's a fucking slow mover."
"8717950","8718910"," Slow mover."
"8724710","8725090"," It's hard. "
"8725250","8726630"," I've traded it and made money on it."
"8727530","8729770"," You got to get in with like Walmart traders."
"8730370","8731270"," You got to like meet them. "
"8731270","8732270"," Don't have a coming budget."
"8732650","8739010"," No, exactly when the Biden administration expected to seek more than $770 billion for the 20-20 US"
"8739010","8739610"," defense budget."
"8739870","8741950"," I'm not a Walmart trader anymore but I used to be. "
"8742610","8743970"," And it can be very lucrative."
"8743970","8747010"," You just have time to promptly go to monetize in the middle of Kerry."
"8747010","8747970"," You don't make a lot of moves. "
"8748170","8753970"," So when they can move, it's usually big and you want to be positioned usually in a spread to print"
"8753970","8754230"," them."
"8771800","8773180"," At least I can see that re."
"8774840","8775960"," I love that hutch. "
"8776580","8777840"," Yeah, let's check AMD, bro."
"8779880","8780960"," Let me go take my break."
"8781020","8781580"," I'm right back. "
"8796780","8800260"," Also of note, this morning we talked about BAC, right?"
"8800260","8802560"," I remember BAC from this morning."
"8802820","8805340"," We're seeing now more calls on BAC."
"8806140","8809840"," May 20th, 50c, $800,000. "
"8810240","8817460"," We highlighted that trade this morning at the open where we also talked about flow algal and what"
"8817460","8818060"," they're targeting."
"8818880","8824480"," So May 20th, 50c, $800,000 on BAC."
"8868320","8871720"," AMD, a day trader or a new trader's paradise. "
"8871720","8874520"," So you guys ever want to learn how to trade stock options?"
"8875020","8878460"," AMD is a great ticker to trade."
"8880020","8881840"," It's always looking for a buy-in."
"8882480","8884120"," AMD typically trades in cycles. "
"8884980","8888060"," If you look at a year chart on AMD trades pretty consistently."
"8889040","8890840"," Looks like buyers are sitting down there at 100."
"8890980","8892040"," They want to take it to 150. "
"8892780","8894820"," I think it's been trading in this range for years now."
"8909330","8912610"," As a matter of fact, AMD was the first ticker I ever traded options on."
"8913950","8921230"," A very easy ticker to trade, long calls on, long up, but it's on a great way to learn how"
"8921230","8924050"," to time the moves in a ticker. "
"8985660","8990160"," Keshkari is saying the Fed is taking very seriously the risk that high inflation could get embedded"
"8990160","8990960"," in psychology."
"9070070","9074110"," Keshkari is saying his caution to his colleagues is let's not overdo it."
"9074790","9080670"," We raised rates really aggressively where the risk of putting the economy into recessions is"

"9094460","9098200"," Just want to make a note that Fed's harker right is a voter."
"9098960","9107720"," That's key to know and harkers saying that he wants a 25 basis point to vote for a 25 basis"
"9107720","9110220"," point rate hike in March."
"9110980","9115500"," Very supportive starting the process of raising the Fed funds rate, which is our primary tool of"

"9116740","9122040"," Start to raise that and I would be supportive of as early as March 25 basis point hike in that"
"9122040","9122320"," rate."
"9122820","9124660"," I need to walk a fine line at the Fed."
"9128730","9130950"," I know it needs to be higher. "
"9138850","9141210"," It needs to be put 25 points in enough."
"9143310","9145770"," I'm a bull and I know 25 points in enough."
"9150870","9154210"," Wait a minute. "
"9154830","9155890"," Hike that's insane."
"9157610","9158530"," What's insane?"
"9162620","9163240"," That's insane."
"9163520","9165260"," We're going to have a runaway inflation. "
"9165840","9166960"," I'm a bull man."
"9167640","9168580"," This is insane now."
"9169560","9173940"," You know all this talk out there they should just peel the sticker off the wound. "
"9176370","9180170"," It's they can fuck up this market if they don't peel the sticker off right."
"9180390","9181850"," They don't peel the band-aid off."
"9182330","9185310"," They're not going to crash the market. "
"9187660","9190220"," I don't think at this point we've become numb to some of it."
"9190460","9194340"," It will dump the market but we're not going to who wouldn't crash it."
"9195520","9198200"," Like all these like 25 basis points. "
"9199260","9199840"," It's nonsense."

"9253120","9254880"," Man spy is brutal. "
"9256300","9258340"," Just trade inside that box right."
"9259080","9261120"," Bam up down up down up down."

"9316540","9321960"," More UAL calls February 1850 C $58,000. "
"9324320","9325720"," UAL has been coming in all morning."
"9325880","9326660"," Someone asked about it."
"9327740","9328920"," Not much movement. "
"9329480","9331080"," I wonder if there's some news that's coming."
"9332760","9334400"," Kind of left scratch in my head."
"9334660","9335520"," Can I have you any of you guys?"
"9336000","9341200"," Because like me looking at a UAL chart, I'm like what's the trade here. "
"9341360","9342960"," I get there's a reopening trade here."
"9344160","9348560"," But me looking at this trade, I get the point that there could be a squeeze higher."
"9350610","9354690"," It's been trading up since January 24th and $39. "
"9355310","9356170"," I understand all that."
"9356910","9359910"," There's a shit ton of money and interest in UAL today."
"9361090","9362690"," Gotta be some kind of news, right?"
"9372420","9375500"," Jay's saying that GGPI is moving. "
"9376620","9377600"," Maybe we can look at Snap."
"9380940","9384280"," Usually when I see these calls, no movement in the ticker."
"9384840","9386500"," Early movement in a day or two. "
"9386680","9387800"," Sometimes you can't follow them."
"9387840","9389300"," I've gotten burned on airlines before."
"9389800","9390580"," I don't trade them anymore. "
"9390700","9391840"," I don't trade these smaller airlines."
"9392100","9397220"," I don't trade RCL, CCL, but sometimes I do, but it's rare."
"9400280","9401780"," But there's a lot of calls coming in. "
"9407280","9409680"," Well, we know that Lucy."
"9410140","9411860"," Even I know that the Fed can't control."
"9412540","9416280"," Well, the Fed can, that's a mixed bag. "
"9416940","9418380"," That's a mixed bag of an answer."
"9419400","9429250"," I can't, well, the Fed does have an impact on inflation, but doesn't in the long view."
"9430730","9434390"," The problem with the Fed is that they're not going to cut off. "
"9435830","9438710"," So they always talk about it, Lucy, like a bathtub, right?"
"9439630","9442730"," You get the faucet with the water pouring the, pouring the money into the tub."
"9443910","9445690"," And then you've got to plug in the tub at the bottom."
"9447050","9455390"," And what they're talking about doing, basically, is slowing the water flow, believing the tub"
"9455390","9456070"," plugged up. "
"9456790","9459550"," What they need to do is, the budget should they need to do."
"9459670","9460150"," It's more complicated."
"9460450","9468870"," It's not a conversation for here, but gem is somewhat right, to an extent. "
"9470150","9474670"," And I do, I do agree with that statement, somewhat."
"9477390","9479390"," But it's not 100% right."
"9484820","9486640"," Or there's a gray area, I should say. "
"9486760","9489700"," The conversation is way longer than making that statement."
"9495650","9497150"," But I agree with him, to an extent."
"9499090","9500430"," No evidence of Russian withdrawal. "
"9500970","9501630"," Yeah, we just heard that."
"9506830","9510890"," My price started on Tesla is somewhere down around 750."
"9511530","9520910"," My outlook on the market right now is that I'm still of the opinion that the"
"9520910","9527190"," market is set up for there's some complications in this statement too, right?"
"9527410","9528290"," I can't, I can't be absolute. "
"9529550","9538890"," My view, though, is that the market trades down at least once more between now and may."
"9539670","9549050"," And my viewpoint is also that there'll be a larger move down later in the year, significant drop."
"9550630","9554670"," I don't know if they're trying to manufacture that not happening, though. "
"9555910","9560330"," With growth stocks already being taken, so many growth stocks being taken down."
"9560850","9562190"," It could just be the indexes."
"9563010","9567490"," If they were to chop off Apple and some of the big tech stocks are holding the market up, it"
"9567490","9569050"," wouldn't impact the entire market. "
"9569050","9574250"," You've already seen our tickers ask you to get hammered, which is unusual."
"9574990","9578230"," Usually you'll see all of it happen at once."
"9580010","9584490"," And currently it looks manufactured like they've knocked down. "
"9584650","9586170"," I think of it like a house on stilts."
"9586950","9588930"," They've knocked down all the major stilts."
"9589210","9591610"," Now there's only like four or five stilts holding up the indexes. "
"9592190","9595870"," So if you just drop those four stilts, you'd lower the indexes to a more reasonable price."
"9596430","9602150"," Everything else wouldn't participate hugely in a massive way like they did already."
"9603490","9604850"," It wouldn't hurt as much. "
"9605690","9610210"," Everybody had already belonged in a bunch of these speculative growth stocks anyway, so it wouldn't"
"9610210","9610790"," be too bad."
"9610990","9611830"," Market would be okay."
"9615490","9621270"," As far as the long and short-term growth cycle, I don't know what the impacts of that are long "
"9621270","9622530","-term one to three years out. "
"9622530","9630250"," If it would be somewhere you wouldn't know until it happened, and then you'd see if you could drop"
"9630250","9635550"," rates at that point, and then you'd try to jumpstart growth again by end of the year."
"9636090","9641670"," Now if you can't jumpstart growth by end of the year, if there's too much of an impact, then we"
"9641670","9647530"," would be at least in a short-term debt cycle low where you could last one to three years."
"9647770","9650470"," Nobody can predict that really, but the impact is on growth. "
"9650470","9656760"," But the longer that they wait, the worse it makes it is my point."
"9657620","9665620"," So they have to attempt to slam it down, and they basically have a year to do it, and if"
"9665620","9668660"," they don't, things could get wild."
"9676890","9677890"," It's not right now. "
"9678190","9679690"," I've seen snap calls coming in this morning."
"9680350","9683630"," Also some Palantir calls coming in this morning, February 18th, 14c."
"9684990","9689430"," February 18th, 14c, 15c's for 50, 60,000 each one. "
"9689790","9691250"," Affirm more calls coming in."
"9694580","9696540"," February 25th, 48c."
"9697520","9699040"," Zoom calls coming in. "
"9700200","9702020"," February 25th, 155c."
"9703120","9709500"," Then I get the argument to where you can buy some of these growth stocks now, and I understand the"
"9709500","9710360"," logic behind that argument."
"9711180","9717700"," My assumption is that we currently might, until I'm proven wrong, the market is trading like it's"
"9717700","9718740"," going to dump one more time. "
"9718760","9719980"," At some point, we now may."
"9720500","9721600"," It could be this week."
"9721780","9722260"," It could be next month. "
"9723860","9728400"," And you'll see one more major dump by end of year."
"9729200","9732280"," We pretty much have three or four good opportunities to trade this market up."
"9733700","9735980"," Could end the year up 9%. "
"9735980","9738760"," I mean, it falls in lines with banks are saying that they expect."
"9741800","9743760"," There's a whole bunch of other paradigms in there."
"9744300","9747760"," A whole bunch of other stuff, the mechanics that go on outside of that. "
"9749460","9750720"," You've got unknown news."
"9751120","9751960"," You've got an election."
"9752700","9756740"," You've got ramifications from Russia, believe it or not, in the election. "
"9758100","9759840"," You've got growth, right?"
"9760380","9762180"," You don't want companies to fold."
"9762460","9769680"," You don't want to be able to give cheap loans to growth companies at some point between now and end"
"9769680","9769980"," of year."
"9772600","9774700"," You just can't have things go wild. "
"9774920","9775160"," You can."
"9775460","9777600"," I mean, I guess some of you out there probably know, right?"
"9777780","9778940"," How expensive are your rents?"
"9779640","9780820"," How expensive is your food?"
"9781400","9783940"," How expensive is it to get a vehicle?"
"9784360","9785940"," I just went shopping physically, right?"
"9786400","9791240"," Shopping for goods this week that I haven't done in some time since winter."
"9792620","9793860"," And they're still shortages. "
"9794980","9798180"," They're still scam shit on the shelves, right?"
"9798340","9803800"," You got into an athletic store and it's like, I was a bunch of yoga shit, but there's no goods"
"9803800","9805780"," geared towards what you want to be doing."
"9806080","9807160"," You know, it's like filler everywhere."
"9808860","9815640"," I noticed some clothing that was not to spec or not, not no selection. "
"9817380","9819840"," Like, you know, hey, what kind of great t-shirts you got?"
"9819940","9821180"," What kind of great fresh shirts you got?"
"9822380","9822820"," That kind of stuff."
"9822980","9824520"," So yeah, I know you guys noticed it out there."
"9827220","9828760"," So you have to get that shit into control. "
"9829060","9833160"," There's a lot of stuff that needs to be done for us to trade higher."
"9833760","9838320"," So you feel like you're a bull and you're like, that's Kashkari saying you'd be surprised if he"
"9838320","9841140"," stays on the job as Fed President until he's 65."
"9846700","9847500"," That's interesting. "
"9851860","9854220"," So Kashkari is a dove and make note of that."
"9856300","9860500"," You know, it's weird because like, the hair arguments from bulls, like, we're going up from here."
"9860800","9863320"," And I get the idea that we're going to turn into a super bubble. "
"9863680","9868100"," But if you're not one of those bulls and you're just a legit bull, like, I want to buy this"
"9868100","9870500"," market and I want to stay in the market for a long time."
"9872940","9876380"," And I don't, you know, the people that have talked about dollar cast averaging on my horizon is a"
"9876380","9876900"," long time."
"9876900","9879940"," Well, tell me if the market doesn't pull back, right?"
"9880440","9886220"," You can't buy for five, 10 years because it will only get worse. "
"9886760","9892840"," If you're a real bull, like honest, I feel like a real honest bull, you know that the market"
"9892840","9895300"," probably needs to give back some of this trade."
"9896960","9900040"," It needs to give back part of the 2021, 2021 trade."
"9901220","9902220"," Everybody knows it. "
"9904000","9908120"," Anyone that's been in the market for like five, 10, 20 years, anything like that knows it."
"9911500","9914960"," Anybody that's been in the market for a month, a lot of time knows that we go through cycles."
"9919200","9926060"," And if we don't go through a down cycle in this market and we just crank higher, they'll be, it'll"
"9926060","9926860"," end badly. "
"9927820","9931460"," Like bad, like there's nothing that's going to save you from that either."
"9932460","9933760"," It's not going to save your job."
"9934280","9935000"," You're a professional. "
"9935600","9936640"," You know, it's not going to save your job."
"9936720","9937720"," It's not going to save your house."
"9939500","9941800"," It doesn't matter if you're not in a variable rate mortgage. "
"9943260","9945800"," If everyone was like, oh, a variable rate mortgage to be fucked."
"9946480","9951420"," I'm like, I know, I remember back in 2007 when people, they weren't in variable rate mortgages, but"
"9951420","9953180"," they owned a home with a note."
"9953980","9956800"," I was like, you know, back then it was like half a million dollar home. "
"9957860","9960240"," Now it's worth $100,000."
"9960640","9962060"," I'm serious, like $150,000."
"9963000","9968120"," Your neighbor just dumped their house and you're the house next door to you. "
"9968360","9971340"," You can't sell your house for the $500,000 you've locked in."
"9972000","9973060"," Can't even sell it."
"9973800","9975460"," Can't move, can't go anywhere. "
"9975880","9980740"," You're under a mortgage and you're fucked."
"9981620","9985800"," There are people that were foreclosing on homes that had a fine mortgage payment."
"9986840","9989840"," There are people that back then that are still living in those homes today. "
"9990880","9994900"," I remember back then, people losing everything."
"9995900","9996740"," They lost everything."
"9997700","9999340"," You know, wrong time to be retiring, right?"
"9999620","10002220"," Like 60 years old or some retiring and they lost all. "
"10003380","10004220"," Other investments."
"10005860","10009740"," Let's say you're 20, 30, 40 years old, 50 years old right now and you get fucked."
"10010400","10012820"," You don't want to be in that cycle. "
"10013520","10019020"," So there should be some hope from bulls that we try to, even if it's through modern monetary"
"10019020","10026480"," theory, try to attempt to wrangle in the market a little bit to extend a bull run."
"10027160","10028320"," I think that's the hope."
"10029020","10030600"," I don't know if that works or not. "
"10030600","10031480"," It might not work."
"10031620","10034040"," I know that inflation can run no matter what."
"10034040","10040140"," I get gems argument, but I'll tell you one thing. "
"10041140","10042160"," For sure, right?"
"10042380","10045360"," You know, that argument that you can't, I'll tell you one thing."
"10046220","10049500"," You know, seven, they did the same thing that they did in March 2020."
"10050340","10054340"," And I remember bears saying in 2020, they can't save this market. "
"10054340","10054960"," It's going to crash."
"10055640","10061960"," I remember the same argument that they couldn't do what we did in 2020 and we did it."
"10062620","10062860"," Right?"
"10063100","10064240"," So we did it. "
"10064580","10070580"," We raised the market up obscenely and they're going to attempt to dump it back down to a reasonable"
"10070580","10073280"," level and then pump it back up again."
"10073900","10075020"," And they were successful."
"10075440","10078280"," They were successful in 0708 and they were successful again. "
"10079260","10083060"," And in 0708, it took like, I think it took a year or two or six months."
"10083680","10088440"," So I think it's six months for them to implement, they even put it at the same policy that they"
"10088440","10090680"," did in 07 in 2020."
"10090680","10092120"," And they're doing it again. "
"10092320","10096960"," They did it again in 2020 and it only took them a month, not six months."
"10098540","10106380"," So I think we do like, you know, we do follow history, but they are using different methods than"
"10106380","10107080"," they have in the past."
"10107940","10113500"," So they're going, you know, they're going to attempt to wrangle the market back in and try to"
"10113500","10115040"," extend the bull run as long as possible. "
"10115920","10119240"," I think if you don't see the bull run end, though, if you see like a, if you see like"
"10119240","10124860"," a Ripper face for Perali, like we did in 2020-2021, I think you're going to see the devastation"
"10124860","10132300"," from that will be damaged on to our comment, damaged on to Main Street, the damaged on to people"

"10134440","10136280"," It will, it'll wreck them."
"10138520","10141320"," Wreck jobs, it'll wreck people in your family's jobs, it'll wreck. "
"10142420","10144400"," It's funny, everybody out there thinks that they're rich."
"10144960","10148240"," I'm like, I don't, there's no real middle class anymore."
"10149580","10155720"," I like there once was, there's wealthy millions, millions, millions, millions. "
"10155880","10162120"," We better have millions and there's the poor as people that think they're middle class and they're"
"10162120","10162400"," not."
"10165000","10169040"," You got to be like less than a million in the bank, like you just free cash."
"10169040","10177680"," You can also say that the government will offer Pfizer, COVID, vaccine shots to all kids, E5 to 11"
"10177680","10178500"," in the UK. "
"10179520","10180720"," Then you're just middle class."
"10181740","10185320"," If you don't have that, you're poor, whether you know that or not."
"10185520","10187640"," And so if this bubble gets bigger, it's going to get even more glaring. "
"10190120","10191180"," So I'm a bull."
"10191860","10195540"," I want to be able, I'm not willing to buy most stocks where they are right now."
"10208900","10210120"," All these crypto kids are rich. "
"10210120","10211780"," No, they think they are, but they're not."
"10213480","10216340"," Until you've had money, you think you are, it's weird."
"10216440","10218780"," When you don't have money, you think, if I have this, I have that, I'm rich. "
"10219760","10221440"," And you'd be surprised when people will run off credit."
"10221680","10223360"," You'd be surprised when people have massive debt."
"10225880","10230300"," And most people that ask an older person, I know, because when I was a kid, I would look to"
"10230300","10232600"," older people and I was like, I don't believe anything they're fucking saying. "
"10233760","10237000"," But some of this stuff happens cyclically."
"10238340","10239600"," You'll see it happens cyclically."
"10246670","10248370"," And you want to buy that dip if you're a bull. "
"10248610","10250970"," If you're a bull, you want to wait for that nice fat dip."
"10251550","10252810"," And people say you can't time it."
"10252910","10253750"," That's bullshit too. "
"10254330","10255390"," You can time it."
"10257350","10258870"," And we'll know if it doesn't do that."
"10259250","10266990"," There are moments in this market that if we aren't going to have a deeper dip, let's say you're a"
"10266990","10268630"," bull and you're like, there's no way we're trading down lower. "
"10269210","10271910"," That there's a moment in this market where you can tell that we're not going to do that."
"10273870","10274990"," See, I'll go along there."
"10275230","10276730"," I'll buy it where I don't want to buy it at that price. "
"10276870","10278670"," You can drag me and kick it in and I'll trade it higher."
"10279610","10287450"," But currently where we're in the market, all signs are pointing towards one more move down and then"
"10287450","10293030"," another move deeper later in the year."
"10303750","10305010"," Yeah, so there's Snap right there. "
"10305450","10308730"," A dip, 39 bucks, solo rep on 42, 44 and 45."
"10309390","10310570"," I think you're going to Snap."
"10316850","10318270"," Not that matters either. "
"10319710","10322110"," Not that matters what the market does."
"10322330","10326930"," If you're trading it as it is right now, you'll probably do better than better dippers and you'll"
"10326930","10329170"," probably do better than bears."
"10330890","10336110"," Traders tend to make out best in these environments better than bulls and bears. "
"10347190","10356710"," So the parent indicator is slightly negative right now since 12 o'clock, now 12.04. There were some"
"10356710","10370630"," sellers above, hiding above here at 4.44.30. I"
"10370630","10372110"," haven't looked at the VICOM for a minute."
"10375070","10380010"," Yeah, still sitting on 28.10. Look at my chart for VICOM here."
"10380530","10383190"," I've got a long standing chart here for VICOM. "
"10387400","10392600"," So my long-term chart here in VICOM, ooh, 2784."
"10392980","10393680"," Is it still down there?"
"10394040","10394380"," 4784?"
"10396280","10397380"," I didn't see that."
"10398340","10400000"," I think so that heads up right there. "
"10401440","10402560"," Let's take a look at VICOM."
"10403980","10405360"," Thanks for the heads up on VICOM."
"10427260","10430060"," We had some puts on pins earlier and I have good calls. "
"10430060","10434940"," January 1940, C, $225,000 calls on misfit."
"10435460","10436200"," So far."
"10437300","10438700"," So far a couple racks. "
"10440080","10443340"," February 18, 13.5 C, $11,000."

"10450560","10451740"," That's a trade for ER. "
"10452440","10459240"," February 18, 56.5 C used to sweep it a block under $18,000, $53,000."
"10475860","10481440"," See, there's a new support down here, $27,000 flat."
"10482620","10483680"," I'm going to set alert that. "
"10494330","10495810"," Thanks for the heads up on VICOM."
"10509090","10511170"," I'm not really concerned about an emergency rate hike."
"10513990","10514890"," There are charts. "
"10515130","10519830"," You can go to, you can go right straight to the trading view and look up what's priced in right"
"10519830","10520090"," now."
"10521350","10525510"," I think we have 50 BPS priced in the market."
"10525510","10532990"," That doesn't mean we will get a shocking reactionary moment to the market if there's words and also"
"10532990","10539130"," in March we'll get shocking reactionary moments, but in terms of just stock prices, he should over"
"10539130","10541450"," time see recovery, even if there is a shock to the market. "
"10544640","10550180"," My concern is that there's verbiage about if inflation comes in hot."
"10550820","10556700"," Let them move from 50 BPS to a higher, $275 to $100."
"10564520","10568660"," Stronger seller stepping in on the spot, $44, $35. "
"10570040","10571400"," Fire stepping in here as well."
"10585040","10587520"," Happened to the minutes reveal a discussion around."
"10588460","10590440"," Yeah, I don't know that there's an emergency rate hike. "
"10590600","10594380"," I don't understand why there would be a need forever for an emergency rate hike."
"10594700","10598280"," I think that if they would have already done it, I think that they're just going to raise rates in"
"10598280","10598460"," March."
"10598480","10606060"," I think they're going to raise them more than likely every Fed meeting, except for December maybe. "
"10606980","10608300"," I think there's a Fed meeting in December."
"10608380","10610160"," I think you'll get a nice pump in the market end of the year."

"10664250","10666690"," So junk bonds are starting to turn up right now."
"10674310","10676750"," There's accumulation on junk bonds right now. "
"10677250","10677470"," Is that?"
"10677610","10678230"," Oh, shit."

"10768740","10769080"," of pumping."

"10770920","10772900"," You might see a squeeze play here in SOFI. "
"10773300","10774060"," It just heads up on this."
"10774800","10780480"," This trade, it's kind of trade 13.15. If they can break above 13.15 or 14, it should be"

"11064390","11068010"," Yeah, I think there's a 50-50 chance that we've sailed down to 420."
"11069730","11070270"," Absolutely. "
"11072430","11077210"," There are technical fundamental reasons why we should be going up today."
"11079090","11080710"," There's a few weird things in the background."

"12503640","12504640"," That news seemed like bullshit."

"12547560","12549680"," Normally, if you're a bear, you missed the first move. "
"12549840","12556820"," There's a second move, but that looked like a dump scam."
"12557600","12560040"," Just like a pump scam looked like a dump scam."
"12576360","12579160"," Yeah, it doesn't matter that CNN had it. "
"12579320","12581840"," It matters who is telling who, right?"
"12582300","12582800"," It's a good point."
"12586260","12588400"," So who made that point because it's a good point?"
"12589540","12599140"," So Quantum Leap saying CNN had that story an hour ago, which takes me back to a post that I"
"12599140","12608700"," made on Twitter this morning, which was, you want to be paying attention to the news that is"
"12608700","12614680"," fed on the minutes, right?"
"12614800","12621960"," I said this morning, you'll have people that'll be talking about what the minutes are and what you"
"12621960","12631100"," really want to pay attention to is what specifically leaked as a presser to the markets."
"12631660","12637220"," And you just heard that news released on Trade the News right before the market dumped. "
"12638760","12642580"," So this is the market manipulation in practice that you're witnessing."
"12643720","12647300"," So if you were long calls on spy then and you'd be like, what the fuck?"
"12648360","12656740"," And so now that you see underneath the layers of the scam of the market, you'll see that when the"
"12656740","12659340"," news matters to the markets, that's when it's released."
"12660020","12665960"," It doesn't matter what you know or I know or anybody else knows, has no bearing on how the market"
"12665960","12670920"," moves, which is bullshit, but that's what it is. "
"12671740","12672700"," That's the fucking scam."
"12674560","12680260"," Calls on the queues, calls on silver, calls on M."
"12680640","12684340"," We talked about them earlier, March 1833C, 30C."
"12685940","12690540"," It calls on AMD February 18th, 114C, $413,000. "
"12693510","12695690"," So this will come back into VWAP here."
"12696390","12698710"," We'll see if there's a rejection of VWAP."
"12698810","12699490"," We'll take a look higher. "
"12700210","12700950"," Mike, get what you're saying."
"12701570","12705810"," Nothing news is old, but it ain't old until the financial markets are told about it."
"12706050","12706890"," Oh, yeah, I'll get that up here. "
"12708490","12715230"," The sellers have come down right there up above at 448 earlier this morning and they're now hiding."
"12719110","12719990"," 444, 446."
"12723410","12726450"," They were up here earlier and now they're lower. "
"12731430","12735310"," The hero indicator is starting to flatten out a little bit where we're coming into right now."
"12735390","12736410"," It's just be conscious of that."
"12761480","12762600"," Yeah, it's a total fucking scam. "
"12763420","12764600"," Whole fucking markets a scam."
"12768300","12770140"," Whether it's trading up or down doesn't matter."
"12770620","12771660"," Just a big one big scam. "
"12772440","12775500"," Question is, are you able to get the information about the scam before other people?"
"12789750","12791230"," Yeah, exactly, Josh."
"12796470","12798810"," Just one big fucking pump and dump scam."
"12800290","12801290"," That's all it is. "
"12805200","12806700"," It's kind of disgusting, right?"
"12807180","12808280"," I can't say it's not disgusting."
"12816020","12818240"," I remember once there was some news that I knew."
"12818640","12821160"," I'm trying to think back of what it was, but I knew some news. "
"12822880","12827040"," I tweeted about it and nobody listened and then I tweeted about it and nobody listened and then the"
"12827040","12828480"," market went up or some shit."
"12829320","12834040"," And then like two weeks later, it was impactful like two weeks later."
"12834280","12835400"," Now, so I rate about it. "
"12835960","12838140"," I couldn't get over it for like a month or two."
"12838300","12839180"," It just ground me wrong."
"12841620","12844260"," And then of course it switched sold off when it became real news. "
"12845920","12849740"," Facebook calls February 25th to 15 C hundred and $35,000."
"12850200","12855680"," Nvidia puts two sweeps on February 18th to 50 P."
"12880720","12890390"," So, let's, let's talk about a, let me give you guys a quick, we're going to go through a bunch"
"12890390","12891550"," of different stuff with a bunch of stuff."
"12891610","12893370"," I'm going to talk about some stuff right here while we're here, okay?"
"12896170","12899350"," So what's the difference between a sweep and a block, okay?"
"12899970","12903850"," A block is often negotiated and be tied to a stock, okay?"
"12904750","12908670"," And then sweeps are aggressive orders filled across multiple exchanges and more likely to be a"
"12908670","12911310"," directional bet on the underlying stock, okay?"
"12911770","12914370"," I tell you guys, hey, this is a block, this is a sweep. "
"12915530","12923490"," The block, the block options can usually be tied to underlying share buys, right?"
"12924770","12926670"," And sweeps are aggressive like slamming the button."
"12926670","12930770"," And they're usually filled across multiple exchanges, right?"
"12930950","12935030"," They're large trades, can't be filled on one exchange."
"12936330","12940690"," And they're more likely to be a directional bet on the underlying stock. "
"12941050","12942990"," That's key to know is it a sweeper, a block, right?"
"12943930","12946710"," So sweeps are officially known as an intramarket sweep order, ISOs."
"12947090","12951870"," A sweep is a liquidity destruction device, not actually, but it's impacts your sucks all the"
"12951870","12954030"," available liquidity out of the market."
"12954510","12958070"," When dealing with sweeps, it's important to understand that some market structure behind how they"
"12958070","12958330"," operate. "
"12959010","12963210"," In application, a sweep order occurs when a traditional block order is split at the exchange level."
"12963690","12967090"," What this means is that someone comes in with an order that is greater than the price quantity,"
"12967810","12970690"," then what the market has readily available at the multiple price levels."
"12970690","12977790"," When this happens, the block gets split and is sent across various exchanges until it fills the"
"12977790","12982830"," entirety of its desired quantity, or there is no longer any liquidity available within the price"
"12982830","12983290"," confines. "
"12984030","12984650"," Of the order."
"12985510","12992570"," An example would mean saving a market trading $1 times 1.101, you want 1,000 options, but you know"
"12992570","12996090"," that you're going to have to be willing to take a hit in the price in order to grab that"
"12996090","12996690"," kind of size."
"12997310","13002390"," So you place a buy order for 1,000 and a dollar 10 instead of a dollar, right?"
"13002710","13007690"," In other words, you want 100, 1,000 contracts are willing to pay as much as a dollar 10 per"
"13007690","13008750"," contract to get them. "
"13009650","13015210"," So as your order hits the market, it instantly fills all the liquidity at a dollar 1 and continues"
"13015210","13021890"," to take all the liquidity from each price level until it achieves either 1,000 contracts you want"
"13021890","13023410"," or reaches a dollar 10."
"13023950","13026010"," And there is no more liquidity for you to pull from."
"13028790","13030310"," So sweeps, right?"
"13030490","13031350"," That is what a sweep is. "
"13031790","13034270"," You swept in the book, okay?"
"13034830","13038230"," So you took all liquidity across each level across each exchange."
"13040230","13045190"," Now, when somebody uses a sweep, it's meant it means that they're hungry to get their order filled"
"13045190","13046610"," and that they're coming in with size."
"13047250","13049050"," That means they're likely to move the price. "
"13049690","13053250"," Sweeps are by far the most important type of order we track, okay?"
"13053470","13057790"," So if I say to you, hey, I've got a sweep here, that means that they're trying to get in"
"13057790","13061230"," on a directional move in the market, okay?"
"13061810","13066970"," Now if there's multiple sweeps, sometimes I'll tell you guys, hey, look, there's four orders, four"
"13066970","13067830"," sweeps, right?"
"13068710","13074930"," That means that if the directional move that buyers are looking for, it's okay."
"13075210","13079710"," So block orders, if I tell you there's a block order, right?"
"13079830","13082010"," Some prefer to find block orders by dollar amount."
"13082350","13083950"," Others prefer contract count. "
"13084270","13086270"," The truth is that it doesn't really matter how you define it."
"13086810","13092290"," A block is a seriously large order getting executed all once it tells you that someone big is in a"
"13092290","13093530"," real hurry to get their fill."
"13094290","13098750"," Blocks often get split at the exchange level and become sweeps, which already talked about, right?"
"13101510","13104550"," So you're probably like, hey, blocks and sweeps are the same, right?"
"13105410","13110370"," They are the same, and while the differences between the two lies solely whether or not the order"
"13110370","13113570"," is split at the exchange level, their meeting couldn't be more polar. "
"13114430","13118770"," A block tells you that a smart guy is in a hurry to fill, but it also tells you that"
"13118770","13120990"," there is more liquidity hidden on the BBO."
"13121810","13125650"," If there wasn't, the order would need to be split and would turn into a sweep."
"13126710","13133490"," As a result, a block doesn't have the ability to move the market as immediately as a sweep, which"
"13133490","13137150"," holds slightly higher value in inter-day trading, okay?"
"13138130","13143130"," So if you see a block trade come in, there might be more available contracts that just you just"
"13143130","13145310"," don't see in that one exchange. "
"13146170","13148730"," Now, if all that liquidity is dried up, right?"
"13148730","13150110"," They have to go into multiple exchanges."
"13150690","13152210"," It means there's a panic to them."
"13152550","13157150"," So if I just tell you, hey, there's three sweeps on Facebook currently, right?"
"13157350","13161550"," It means that they weren't able to fill these contracts on this one exchange. "
"13161930","13167510"," There's a hurry up aspect to it, and it'll impact the price, the underlying price faster than a"
"13167510","13168870"," block trade, okay?"
"13168950","13171290"," So that's the difference between sweeps and blocks."
"13172330","13173710"," Sweeps and blocks, okay?"
"13174230","13177670"," So market impact on blocks means there's too much liquidity."
"13177670","13179890"," They got filled quickly, right?"
"13180010","13181330"," They're not going to impact the price. "
"13181910","13187450"," A sweep means that more than likely it's going to impact quickly, like the first five or ten"
"13187450","13190110"," minutes of the movement of a stock price."
"13192760","13194220"," You guys all get that out there."
"13239510","13241970"," So now Macy's is getting pumped on CNBC. "
"13243130","13244750"," What a bunch of scammers, dude."
"13245210","13248830"," So we followed the CNBC fucking insider trading, huh?"
"13250310","13250990"," Disgusting."
"13254590","13255650"," So gross. "
"13260820","13262280"," You got it."
"13262620","13269440"," We're watching the insider trading of CNBC live and calling it out here, and then they're on CNBC"
"13269440","13270160"," pumping it."
"13270740","13271140"," Gross. "
"13274120","13300150"," Is it"
"13300150","13300390"," really?"
"13300810","13300830"," Wiki?"
"13302010","13302970"," Does it matter?"
"13303390","13305790"," They didn't get their directional place, another pumping it on CNBC."
"13308130","13310970"," They just had more calls come in on Macy's earlier."
"13311010","13312570"," I'm going to list them all off to you once more. "
"13314810","13315990"," It's still trading down."
"13316770","13319370"," Let's see what the last calls were at Macy's."
"13325290","13327630"," It's another calling in the backups to make their calls print. "
"13328790","13333050"," Okay, seven orders on Macy's for $664,000."
"13334050","13337590"," They started the trade at 959 at 10 o'clock."
"13339070","13341450"," And the price at 10 was woof. "
"13342650","13344170"," Well, they got, they got rocked."
"13345550","13347290"," Oh wait, no, I don't know."
"13347730","13349330"," They bought their calls at what time?"
"13349990","13350370"," 10 o'clock. "
"13352550","13359250"," So they bought them when the price was $26.28. It started going up and then it started clicking"
"13359250","13360290"," selling off even more."
"13361050","13369350"," So they started their trade at 10 a.m. They bought two 18 27.5 C's for doesn't touch on"
"13369350","13369670"," the price."
"13370570","13374170"," But then they went back in and bought at 10 20. "
"13374810","13376090"," Where's 10 20?"
"13379180","13383100"," So they bought the second dip at 10 20 right at another bottom."
"13383660","13385020"," They went in and bought again."
"13386080","13391380"," They bought March 18 33 C those printed for a minute. "
"13392100","13394840"," They printed between 10 20 and 10 40."
"13396080","13397740"," So that's what, so that 10 20."
"13397960","13399500"," And then they went back in at 10 27. "
"13401280","13402800"," They bought some more calls."
"13403640","13404840"," They got fucked on those."
"13405460","13409120"," Those are a 311 30 C for $50,000. "
"13409380","13410220"," They got burned on those."
"13411840","13413240"," Then at 1241."
"13419070","13421930"," At this bottom dip at 1241, right?"
"13422230","13423090"," Dude, they're buying these dips. "
"13423310","13424890"," It's almost perfect timing."
"13426530","13432390"," So 1241, they bought March 18 33 C for $26,000."
"13432850","13436630"," They went up a little bit and then they went back in at 1241. "
"13436890","13441970"," They bought March 18 30 C for $56,000."
"13442450","13443450"," And it's starting to sell off."
"13444290","13446290"," Then they go on CNBC and try to pump it. "
"13450190","13451650"," Yeah, I'm not a fan of Macy's."
"13459850","13463970"," Remember, do you guys remember when Macy's was going to go bankrupt?"
"13464810","13465890"," Do you guys remember that whole thing?"
"13466570","13468450"," I remember all that news."
"13468710","13471010"," I remember like a Macy's trade. "
"13471250","13472570"," Yeah, Macy's was trading single digits."
"13473670","13474970"," It was like Hertz."
"13482100","13482940"," I remember all that. "
"13500770","13505130"," So the here indicator is turning negative again since 1251 or so."
"13507290","13509570"," Bears are hoping for another rollover point here."
"13515940","13517420"," I don't know if they get it or not. "
"13526140","13529780"," It's a highway to the danger zone."
"13530580","13535500"," I mean, that that's so you're listening to trade the news."
"13535840","13540260"," That sell off reminded me of if any of you guys are forex traders out there, that should happen to"
"13540260","13541460"," forex trading all the time. "
"13543430","13545150"," That's a fishing operation right there."
"13545170","13547790"," If there ever was one, like fishing scam."
"13548470","13550090"," Someone released the news early. "
"13551690","13552910"," They released the news."
"13553390","13554630"," So someone knows what the minutes are."
"13554630","13555790"," And then they're going to pump the market. "
"13556450","13563270"," So they do a quick dump story by calls down at 44 1.94. They're ready to rock and roll."
"13564510","13566790"," I wonder if they loaded up on calls down there too."
"13567690","13568410"," I don't see them. "
"13573420","13574740"," I don't see any new interests."
"13575220","13577740"," I see four four four five zeros."
"13578960","13582020"," Has more interest in them, but not like huge. "
"13589510","13591990"," And you guys understand the difference now between sweeps and puts."
"13591990","13595610"," That's what you guys understand the difference between sweeps and blocks now."
"13596390","13599910"," Does anybody not understand the difference between a sweep and a block?"
"13603800","13608220"," Was anybody here out there right now listening not understand the difference between a sweep and a"
"13608220","13608380"," block?"
"13609460","13613340"," Just say something and I'll review it and I'll dumb it down really simple. "
"13617000","13618840"," We should do this stuff every day, right?"
"13618980","13622160"," We'll go through we'll just talk like simple concepts."
"13624040","13629300"," We'll go through simple concepts on live if we have a law on the day."
"13634380","13637200"," Okay, what's the sweep in Abraham?"
"13637540","13638460"," You don't understand the difference?"
"13639900","13640800"," Yeah, I'll do it down. "
"13642080","13647100"," Okay, so I'll call out options orders during the day."
"13647300","13649860"," And I'll sometimes tell you these are sweeps, these are blocks."
"13653440","13656320"," And there are different exchanges, right?"
"13656560","13659360"," There's a CME, there's New York Stock Exchange. "
"13659700","13660920"," A bunch of different exchanges out there."
"13663260","13665060"," And let me demo it down."
"13665400","13674300"," So if I am selling spy 450 calls and let's say I'm selling a thousand"
"13674300","13677360"," contracts for today. "
"13677640","13680880"," Let's say I'm out there and I'm selling I own the underlying I own spy."
"13682700","13688220"," And I'm selling a thousand calls at 450 for a dollar."
"13693080","13698900"," And you want 5,000 calls, right?"
"13700220","13701320"," And there's not enough. "
"13702240","13705180"," But you're like slamming the buy button like I want them right now."
"13705480","13706880"," I don't care what the price is."
"13707280","13708760"," I don't care what it is. "
"13708860","13710720"," I don't care if it's a dollar, I don't care if it's a dollar 10."
"13711500","13713180"," I don't care if it's a dollar 20, right?"
"13714660","13718580"," Someone out there's a market maker dealer on the other side of that trade."
"13718780","13723340"," And he's like, or she is like, well, shit, we got to get that guy some calls, right?"
"13725340","13729160"," And we borrow underlying stock, right?"
"13729380","13730440"," We borrow spy stock. "
"13730440","13733020"," So I go, okay, I just filled them for you."
"13734160","13737820"," Before I look elsewhere, try to find them available on a different exchange, wherever I can find"
"13737820","13738120"," them."
"13738780","13743280"," And I fill your stock for whatever price I can get them for. "
"13744240","13749540"," So boom, let's say I fill half of them at, let's say the 500, the 5,000 orders, I get"
"13749540","13754260"," some of them at a dollar, some of them at a dollar five, some of the dollar 10, or whatever,"
"13754460","13756740"," you just provided liquidity to the buyer, right?"
"13757360","13760640"," So mine sold and there wasn't more than a thousand available."
"13762520","13765500"," But there's a hardness to it, right?"
"13765800","13767300"," There's like an urgency to it."
"13767300","13769300"," I'm not going to say it results to the treasurer's 20-year bond auction. "
"13769920","13773120"," Uh oh, time for the twos and 20s."
"13775590","13776930"," Time for the ones and twos."
"13782510","13784090"," So there's an urgency to it, right?"
"13784350","13788170"," We can move the market because of that urgency. "
"13788910","13791990"," There's demand and there isn't anything available."
"13792250","13793950"," There aren't actual options available."
"13797380","13799140"," And I don't care what the price is, I just want them. "
"13799220","13800260"," You have to go out there and find them."
"13800380","13800800"," That's a sweep."
"13802040","13804440"," Now, a sweep can be a part of a block trade, right?"
"13804620","13805780"," So it starts out as a block trade. "
"13805780","13810580"," I want 5,000 spy calls for 450C."
"13810880","13813720"," Now, if there's 5,000 available, no big deal, right?"
"13814120","13816500"," Everybody wants spy 450Cs."
"13817120","13818060"," So who cares?"
"13822330","13823690"," That's a matter of supply and demand. "
"13824090","13829590"," And if you see that urgency, right, it will usually raise the price of the underlying up."
"13830550","13835090"," And then another way to describe that would be if if there was like a ticker that nobody's trading,"
"13835090","13840630"," then all of a sudden out of nowhere, everybody wants a strike all at once."
"13841690","13844110"," It's going to drive the demand up, right?"
"13844250","13848950"," And the price of the underlying, the share price is going to go up from that demand, right?"
"13849650","13851390"," The dealers and the market makers have to hedge. "
"13851650","13852310"," They're like, oh, shit."
"13852870","13857330"," While all of a sudden does everybody want 450Cs right now?"
"13862660","13869340"," 20-year bond option, drawing in 2-spot, 396%, 72.1% in the lobby at the high."
"13869800","13874180"," If you cover 2-spot, 4-4, and drag that, it's 62.9% and it strikes at 21%. "
"13876860","13887020"," So I'm"
"13887020","13888240"," going to watch the shy right now."
"13909850","13911090"," This is important."
"13911990","13921610"," So US Treasury, 19 billion on the 20-year bond option draws, 2.396% versus 2 "
"13921610","13923090",".065 prior. "
"13923840","13930850"," Did to cover 2.44 versus 2.34 prior, 2.29 over the last four auctions."
"13932510","13938810"," It is key though to note that 19 billion is down from the last one of 23 billion on the"
"13938810","13939850"," 20-year bond option."
"13940750","13944210"," The dealers take 16.1%, direct betters took 21%. "
"13947250","13952550"," Interact betters take 62.9% of the competitive bids with 72.1% allotted at the high."
"13954480","13957600"," So it impacts IEF and S-Y-S-H-Y."
"13961260","13963300"," And the shy is dropping currently. "
"13997000","13998160"," Yeah, I've bought them all."
"13998340","14004140"," I've bought all the different, I've bought all the different like I've bought in the usual whales."
"14004480","14009860"," I've bought some people like you on the usual whales, some people like trading ticks, some people"
"14009860","14011420"," like I think Binseng has got something. "
"14011840","14018440"," I think even I think a lot of I think Spock am might even have some kind of flow service."
"14018440","14020160"," They might not don't hold me to that one."
"14020600","14028160"," But I know they like some some other people offer flow services. "
"14028460","14032060"," For me, I just need the quickest, most direct actionable information I can get."
"14033760","14039420"," I get on the trading ticks hole and I'm just spending two, three, four fucking hours trying to"
"14039420","14040280"," figure out what's going on."
"14041480","14043300"," A lot of their indicators don't work. "
"14043940","14049380"," Like they'll be like, there's days where they get a list of like five or 10 tickers and 12 tickers."
"14049820","14050980"," It's going someplace."
"14051140","14054840"," It's going someplace and you're watching those tickers for like three to five days and they don't"
"14054840","14059660"," really move and then the market moves against those tickers and then the whole thing's fucked up. "
"14062570","14070470"," So instead of watching that, I'm just looking for what like direct right now, what where's all the"
"14070470","14071230"," money falling into."
"14082760","14086780"," I didn't know you could advertise for free on usual whales."
"14087760","14089860"," Yeah, I was in black box at one point. "
"14090280","14091560"," I did the black box thing."
"14091680","14097700"," I didn't like I don't know if it was the cost or if it was the undercurrent of what was"
"14097700","14098060"," going on."
"14098200","14100760"," I thought I think I thought I think I didn't like black box. "
"14100760","14102300"," I don't know where I know exactly why."
"14103000","14105580"," I don't know if they're just trying to tell me too much shit or something."
"14106600","14109540"," I can't recall why I didn't like black box but I've used them too. "
"14117360","14119360"," Yeah, that's interesting fisted."
"14120280","14122680"," You do have to interpret what's going on, right?"
"14123280","14124260"," That's a fair point."
"14128250","14131530"," A more success following accounts posting UW than the software itself. "
"14133050","14134870"," I've used I've used cheddar flow."
"14135230","14136030"," I've paid for cheddar flow."
"14136250","14139710"," I didn't like cheddar flow seemed a little bit too weak for me. "
"14140930","14142790"," But I've paid for cheddar flow as well."
"14145410","14151530"," But yeah, I didn't know that the fur was used to use cheddar."
"14159750","14161490"," Or not cheddar unusual whales. "
"14165930","14169030"," Some puts coming in on ArcG put Pete on an NVIDIA."
"14169750","14172670"," Not too big but some calls on open."
"14173490","14175970"," I've seen that but it'd be a very popular ticker recently. "
"14176430","14180930"," Open January 20th 12.5 c for a sweep and a block."
"14182010","14184850"," $330,000 twice open."
"14199070","14201590"," Spy trading higher some recovery here. "
"14205560","14210480"," Some hidden buyers above at 443.60. Here indicator is negative right now."
"14210640","14211460"," Be careful of that straight."
"14213820","14215220"," More buyers and sellers. "
"14216140","14217380"," It's the same story, right?"
"14217620","14219200"," Wait until 207."
"14221980","14225920"," People are saying we've got two o'clock time for the minutes release."
"14236800","14238580"," I'm watching the spy still. "
"14239860","14240820"," It's brutal, right?"
"14241040","14246260"," They've just worn down the options chain all day long on the 16th."
"14247520","14249860"," Just killing murder and options today."
"14252650","14257170"," Straight murder and you got like a bunch of market makers and dealers just sitting there giggling"
"14257170","14259750"," laughing, smoking fat cigars, drinking whiskey. "
"14261270","14263510"," They're like, look at these traders are in here buying all this shit."
"14264670","14268110"," We're just going to suck like a vampire all the value off their options."
"14271380","14273820"," Looks like the implied move is 440 to 445. "
"14275480","14276760"," We're trading right in the middle."
"14286690","14289770"," I haven't used market action so I can't attest to it."
"14292910","14294330"," Still using market actions cheap. "
"14294530","14295930"," I think it's more like raw flow or fog."
"14296350","14302510"," You know what I used to really like is I used to really like to use when I was buying"
"14302510","14302950"," stock."
"14304890","14309730"," I found paying for what did I really like?"
"14311490","14313270"," Let me take a look here and see what I really like. "
"14314830","14325050"," I like"
"14325050","14326190"," paying for."
"14327990","14329410"," The fuck was it?"
"14333170","14334350"," Everybody, Finviz."
"14334890","14336990"," I used to pay for Finviz back in the day. "
"14337810","14341610"," But I was using it for like deep dark research on companies."
"14351040","14402440"," So I"
"14402440","14405680"," pay for whatever the professional one is on trading view like the top tier."
"14407300","14409740"," And I had tickers to it and track them over time. "
"14410620","14413200"," I don't pay for data on trading view."
"14414020","14415320"," I'm not trading futures."
"14416020","14417800"," I do pay for data on book map. "
"14419280","14421740"," And I trade on tasty."
"14423300","14428680"," Currently, I have a couple of other platforms of money in it but I'm currently using tasty as my"
"14428680","14429160"," trading platform."
"14430760","14431860"," I have fucking broke. "
"14432040","14433440"," I have fucking accounts everywhere."
"14434520","14436580"," I have accounts littered across the landscape."
"14436580","14440160"," I was experiencing January retail sales exceeded expectations. "
"14440640","14441760"," Oh, here's the pump."
"14443240","14444100"," Dust pump."
"14446900","14450500"," You know, like over time, like right when Robinhood came out, I got an account over there. "
"14451800","14452920"," Got Robinhood."
"14453140","14453940"," I got think of swim."
"14454320","14456740"," I got wee bull accounts kicking around somewhere. "
"14457440","14459800"," I got like 10 different tasty trade accounts."
"14460820","14462640"," New accounts littering the landscape."
"14474870","14476090"," All right, I'm biggie. "
"14478250","14480030"," Did they give you any free food?"
"14481310","14486810"," Oh, I had 10 foil hat prediction."
"14487110","14488210"," I like to hear in these doboi."
"14488530","14490390"," No news or good news in minutes. "
"14490670","14493710"," Market rips and dip buyers calls rip."
"14495190","14498010"," Then more news during our hour."
"14498950","14499910"," Mm-hmm. "
"14500750","14501670"," Oh, I see it."
"14503050","14507250"," My prediction for today give you all you guys give me a predictions out there."
"14507690","14508550"," Doablei give a prediction. "
"14508790","14509130"," I like it."
"14512790","14513370"," I think."
"14515430","14516690"," So we're getting close. "
"14516910","14518270"," It's 1 12 in the afternoon."
"14521960","14522840"," Raw hods."
"14525420","14529860"," So they've got a everybody's loaded up a load of the tits on 440Ps. "
"14541290","14543050"," So you remember it's calling 445."
"14545310","14546990"," 449 then reverses."
"14548410","14548890"," Nothing. "
"14549130","14550030"," Nothing burger here."
"14550330","14550450"," Yeah."
"14550730","14552610"," Dump right before meeting then rip after. "
"14553190","14554090"," Yeah, de-gen."
"14554830","14555810"," That's what I'm thinking bro."
"14557950","14560290"," I think you're going to see a dump and then a rip. "
"14565680","14566460"," That's what I think."
"14566660","14567240"," Oh, wait a minute."
"14567340","14568580"," There might be some news being released. "
"14569760","14570920"," Heads up out there."
"14573160","14574800"," Some dick bag out there."
"14575260","14578160"," Some some asshole bought TQQQs. "
"14578640","14582960"," March 25th, 52C for a half million million dollars."
"14586580","14590100"," You think I'm a gambler TQQQ."
"14591440","14595140"," March 25th, 52C for $545,000. "
"14595560","14596380"," It's a sweep."
"14598180","14599020"," QQQs."
"14602180","14606540"," February 16th, 350C, $209,000. "
"14607680","14608300"," Glucid."
"14609860","14611780"," February 25th, 31C."
"14613560","14614800"," $33,000. "
"14615420","14616360"," Hi, I'll go score."
"14658890","14660330"," Yeah, some insider bottom."
"14666320","14667480"," You get March calls. "
"14667820","14668760"," You're not going to care about a dip."
"14679800","14680800"," Yeah, some creepy old man."
"14681520","14683740"," He likes to guard a smoking white guy. "
"14688010","14689390"," He's had like three wives."
"14690890","14691930"," He travels for 11."
"14693770","14696650"," He eats steak, thinks big reds from California every night. "
"14701250","14702490"," He's got a huge bankroll."
"14707910","14709850"," Slowly as fuck sleeps alone every night."
"14715440","14715880"," That's terrible. "
"14716600","14717760"," Imagine having that life that would suck."
"14730970","14732490"," I don't know, I couldn't do it."
"14732570","14733350"," I guess some people like it. "
"14740200","14741100"," 10 video calls."
"14741940","14746580"," February 18th, 267.5C, $249,000."
"14746700","14751500"," I asked for a secretary saying that we're still in a window where an attack could come at any time"
"14751500","14751960"," by Russia. "
"14752640","14752960"," Uh-oh."
"14753840","14754620"," That's the fence."
"14755100","14758240"," The only first repo operation, 87 counterparties taking one point. "
"14758300","14758340"," So I'm going to say that, I'm going to say that."
"14765660","14767920"," Yeah, that's my kind of think it is too Kareem."
"14769160","14772460"," I think that's like a, I don't think they take the whole entire country. "
"14772560","14778940"," It's White House reiterating that a Russian attack could be preceded by a false flag operation as a"
"14778940","14780000"," pretext for invasion."
"14782040","14783340"," I think they take part of it."
"14783640","14790500"," I think that's, I think that Biden yesterday outlined what they're allowed to do and the Russians"
"14790500","14796460"," will run with that and just try not to break any of the rules that the US has set out"
"14796460","14801090"," for an annexation of the least part of the country. "
"14804420","14807960"," Now, how does that relate to the markets though, is the next question, right?"
"14809600","14811140"," And it's bad for the markets."
"14811620","14815840"," Usually there's, if there's an invasion, there will be weakness in the market."
"14816040","14820680"," Anywhere from 1 to 3% of it doesn't involve anybody from the US. "
"14825040","14829720"," You'd see a 1 to 3% drop more than likely in a recovery over the course of a month."
"14830580","14840300"," Now, there are risks, like if a rocket was to strike anything like an airplane, civilian aircraft,"
"14840940","14847780"," or a naval ship, if there were shots fired that wounded Americans anywhere, you'd probably expect a"
"14847780","14855200"," bigger dip just on fear and maybe bigger sanctions and then you'd probably look for a three month"
"14855200","14856440"," recovery on a move like that."
"14858560","14861260"," So, there are risks there to the market. "
"14865910","14867690"," Just be careful of this for up here, okay?"
"14868250","14872310"," This looks very bullish to me, like if I was looking at the chart on its own, I'd say yes,"
"14872310","14872770"," it's bullish."
"14873730","14876150"," There are a lot of what's coming into the market currently."
"14876770","14879890"," The heroin indicator is flat to down right now. "
"14880330","14884410"," We'll try to spread this out and see if it's actually moving up for a different time frame."
"14887360","14893280"," If you look at the heroin indicator, it's still dropping off since about, I think it's 12 12 o "
"14893280","14894440","'clock, it's been going down."
"14895760","14897020"," Just be careful in here. "
"14897620","14901180"," This is where you separate the women from the girls."
"14906260","14911700"," This is where you can lose a fortune and still be correct in your call."
"14914200","14920900"," If you're going to trade this event, I also want to recommend, let's say you have, I don't know,"
"14921000","14929120"," $100, then you trade with, like, start your trade with a $10, right?"
"14929340","14935440"," And then $20, and then $30, so that if you need to, let's say the move is still going in"
"14935440","14936800"," the direction you think it's going in. "
"14937220","14941380"," If your conviction is, hey, we're going up, but we get a dip, you have to be able to account"
"14941380","14941580"," that."
"14941580","14944140"," I was saying that the arena opened to diplomacy with Russia."
"14950810","14951510"," Yes, sir. "
"14952590","14954330"," Ukraine does have an implication for Taiwan."
"14960090","14963910"," There are lots of other implications as well, but there are implications in our market."
"14964070","14964930"," You have to be aware of those. "
"14965630","14969970"," If at any point there is an invasion of any kind, you will see an impact in our markets."
"14972050","14974050"," I looked at a chart, I should bring it out."
"14974170","14978110"," I don't know where it is, but I had a chart that showed events like this. "
"14978390","14981110"," I looked at, like, 20 of them, and they were all negative."
"14981410","14983750"," There was no positivity to our market from these events."
"14983750","14993110"," So this would be a first, I think, our market going up if it happens. "
"14997470","15002570"," There should be an initial shock, and then we're looking for any implications down the road to see"
"15002570","15003830"," how long it would take to recover from it."
"15017980","15019840"," Yeah, Josh, like oil and semiconductors."
"15026380","15028220"," I don't think it matters when it happens, too, right?"
"15028400","15028680"," What do they do?"
"15028800","15032520"," They can park 140,000 soldiers there and just wait us out, right?"
"15033300","15036400"," And so it passes the news cycle and they roll in there overnight. "
"15038800","15043700"," It doesn't matter when it happens, but I understand why they want it to happen."
"15044240","15046660"," I understand why they want it to happen."
"15052250","15053870"," Let's snap another line in here. "
"15074380","15084920"," Some sellers hiding above at 444.12. Looks"
"15084920","15097400"," like they're going to want to feed into it right up"
"15097400","15097760"," here."
"15097760","15116940"," 444.30. 445"
"15116940","15118560"," calls now 73 cents."
"15118840","15120400"," They're down in, like, 60s for a minute there. "
"15123310","15125970"," Give them eyes out to see if there's any call premium."
"15126690","15128990"," I don't see any as of yet."
"15129890","15131110"," I'm pretty stable all day long. "
"15134970","15137610"," Puts are now back to 60 cents."
"15139390","15141010"," 58 and 60 cents."
"15141210","15144230"," So no real change in the premium on the put side of things. "
"15152700","15154380"," Hell yeah, Viacom is ripping."
"15156940","15162200"," Yeah, it's a strong use of the word ripping by close enough."
"15166790","15173990"," Spy calls February 16th, 446C, $25,000. "
"15174910","15177150"," Day trader probably trying to take it up to that 440."
"15181360","15182800"," Probably trying to take it up here."
"15186400","15192780"," I'm not willing to take a trade yet until I see the here under here turning up. "
"15194180","15196460"," Got 275 viewers today."
"15196900","15197820"," Thanks for tuning in."
"15197940","15199720"," We're going to have a make or break day here. "
"15200040","15203960"," So if you are tuning in to the broadcast, thanks for joining us, Kevin Jim James."
"15204780","15210160"," Now we're here trying to trade the moves on the FOMC minutes."
"15211800","15217520"," And the past, just from past experience on FOMC minutes, you can actually check, go back and take a"
"15217520","15217880"," few minutes. "
"15217920","15226160"," We have a half an hour until the expected release at 2 p.m. and 2.30. Usually you'll start"
"15226160","15233380"," to see a move around 1.30. In the past, what I've seen is whoever has the biggest you know,"
"15233480","15236380"," no matter what the direction is, let's say we're going to go up."
"15239640","15242840"," If everybody's loaded up on puts, they'll just dump it and go up."
"15243700","15248660"," If we're going to go down and everybody's loaded on puts, we'll typically rip higher, then go"
"15248660","15251540"," lower, and destroy all the puts first so they don't pay them. "
"15253460","15255180"," If that makes sense to you, I don't know."
"15256740","15258320"," So let's say we're going up here."
"15258400","15260820"," There's a lot, there's a big argument for us going up. "
"15260960","15265180"," There's been a lot of accumulation at this point."
"15265180","15269840"," The spy has been actively shorted, heavily shorted."
"15270420","15275580"," You see tickers all over the place moving up, and yeah, you see the spy just trading sideways. "
"15276460","15279400"," So we know there's a large short operation on the spy right now."
"15279420","15281500"," There's a big heavy thumb and hand on the spy."
"15283570","15291230"," The implication is that if the news isn't absolutely terrible, that we should trade much higher. "
"15291510","15294750"," At least 4450, if not, 448450."
"15295730","15299210"," We'll look higher if you're new joining us right now, and we can show you where the price target"
"15299210","15299810"," above is."
"15306730","15308490"," We've got some resistance here, right?"
"15308710","15311850"," But the real price target is above somewhere around 448. "
"15313050","15321780"," Got some resistance here at 447.55. Real price target above is"
"15321780","15331600"," 447.90, 448.99. Now underneath, there is no hub, a lot of support, right?"
"15331600","15337000"," So if we get some negative news, the price target below is, everyone's saying Ritz 435."
"15337680","15340360"," Real price target down below is more like 420."
"15341040","15342440"," We'll show you guys that real quick. "
"15342680","15346920"," From Canadian police, you're seeing an existing emberson in a tuba US port."
"15347540","15350800"," The entry has been reopened after protests have been cleared."
"15351400","15352940"," I just want you guys to see this down here. "
"15353080","15357560"," Can't wait to be aware of this, 422.19. Okay, let's say I didn't tell you."
"15358740","15361420"," So this is where the real money is down below."
"15362140","15365060"," There are banks down here saying there's any problems. "
"15366280","15367860"," This is where we trade to, okay?"
"15368440","15370500"," We also have 425 down here."
"15370840","15372560"," The real by the dip is down below 420."
"15372960","15374080"," So just be conscious of that. "
"15374880","15379380"," Hero indicator here is showing you where people are placing bets on options, calls, and puts."
"15382920","15389140"," There might be some unknown talk inside of the minutes that are a part of if inflation is high."
"15389460","15390880"," We didn't get a reaction on PPI. "
"15390880","15397620"," We did on CPI, but if there was any kind of talk about if those prints come out hot and"
"15397620","15401360"," that they might take more aggressive action, I don't think that it includes like an emergency fed"
"15401360","15401600"," meeting."
"15401600","15407100"," I think it would more or less include pricing in a higher BPS, maybe going from 50 to 100."
"15409160","15412180"," And, you know, at the end of the day, does it really fucking matter?"
"15412320","15413960"," Well, it really fucking matters is the market, right?"
"15414660","15419480"," And they're going to trade this any way they want, regardless of what you think it should be. "
"15419480","15426280"," So to keep a clear mind, we could trade it up from now into Thursday."
"15427320","15428400"," We could trade it down."
"15430240","15431240"," Not to the depths of hell. "
"15431360","15434560"," Let's see, we trade it down to 435, then then all of a sudden we put 2% on the"
"15434560","15436620"," board tomorrow, Thursday, right?"
"15436740","15437840"," It comes sideways for Friday."
"15439400","15444160"," And then we start selling off after that, you know, looking now towards the FOMC."
"15444620","15446640"," So a lot of moves are going to be made in the market right now. "
"15447880","15452820"," So what we're doing to trade this, what I would recommend for you to do to trade this, if you"
"15452820","15457140"," want a recommendation, not financial advice, is to not trade it at all."
"15457940","15459260"," Because you can lose a lot of money here."
"15460120","15466760"," My plan, I think I'm going to take us a straddle on the market as we get closer to the"
"15466760","15467880"," two o'clock hour for me at least. "
"15468580","15471900"," Probably get some puts and some calls and I bet both sides print a little bit."
"15471900","15479000"," Uh, there's a lot of interest today on 440Ps."
"15479380","15483020"," Those are 62 cents currently, 63 cents. "
"15483680","15485520"," 445s or 68 cents."
"15485980","15487200"," Those are for data for today."
"15487800","15494440"," You could also get some Friday strikes as well, as well instead, so you don't get fucked, right?"
"15494700","15496260"," So you don't, maybe nothing happens. "
"15497200","15499020"," And the move isn't until tomorrow."
"15501430","15504690"," You've got some calls coming in on Tesla, February 25th, 900c."
"15505570","15508370"," It's a split, $860,000. "
"15509030","15509990"," That's between two exchanges."
"15513660","15515400"," So I guess that's my point, right?"
"15515840","15519060"," How do you trade this?"
"15519240","15519540"," I don't know."
"15519740","15521300"," I'm like, I can't tell you where we're going. "
"15521840","15524200"," There are some indicators saying that we're going down."
"15526100","15527780"," There are indicators saying that we're going down."
"15528000","15528880"," Okay, just clear as day. "
"15529460","15531280"," And there are some definite indicators saying we're going up."
"15531920","15536400"," Uh, I think Mike the Silva brought up something about junk bonds."
"15536620","15538480"," Junk bonds are at a huge low right now. "
"15538860","15542280"," If you look at junk bonds over the course of a year, snap a line right where it's sitting right"
"15542280","15542560"," now."
"15543040","15548520"," And if it dips below the line that it's sitting on right now, we've had some very ugly moments."
"15548860","15555440"," And I guess it's the degree, Governor Lane commenting that the BOC will be nimble and if necessary,"
"15555440","15560220"," forceful in using monetary policy tools to address inflation. "
"15561380","15564200"," I want you to not don't open a year chart."
"15564220","15565740"," Open like a five year chart, right?"
"15565980","15568740"," And scale it out and just let me say that to be more focused."
"15569520","15576020"," You scaled down inflation risks and be forceful if necessary in using policy. "
"15579230","15586850"," If you look at a chart for Jan K going back to like 2018, 2015, 2011, like just got a"
"15586850","15594530"," big ass chart and junk bonds measures risk that banks are willing to take on junk bonds, right?"
"15595150","15599970"," They're going to buy junk bonds that are high risk investments that they're going to make money for"
"15599970","15600350"," them, right?"
"15600530","15607810"," So if they don't, if they don't, um, if they don't pay off, or if they're wearing a risk off"
"15607810","15610450"," environment, they're not going to buy junk bonds, right?"
"15610750","15612050"," It's pretty simple, right?"
"15613090","15620130"," And if you look at previous moments in the past and we've traded lower than we are right now on"
"15620130","15628230"," Jan K, they're in some huge risk off environments, no bueno, right?"
"15628770","15636150"," So if you want to look for a crash indicator for today or just this the past week or two,"
"15636150","15636410"," right?"
"15636630","15642090"," Just look at a crash indicator for the market and look at Jan K, a big ass chart on it"
"15642090","15644670"," and you can see, snap a line, right?"
"15644830","15646350"," Where we are and look back five, 10 years."
"15647290","15650790"," And that is saying two things, right?"
"15651010","15654570"," Either we're going to catch a bid on junk bonds and move higher."
"15656750","15661410"," Then we know that Dix is higher right now, but we know that the GEX is not, right?"
"15661490","15663590"," So that's conflicting information for a move higher. "
"15664390","15668970"," We know that the bid into the market, the advance or decline is not what it should be."
"15670410","15671370"," That's not bullish."
"15672690","15675690"," It almost looks like banks are just forced to buy, right?"
"15676350","15681270"," That's not like we have participation from the rest of the market thinking we're going along. "
"15681930","15687270"," We know that there's no calls out there for 480, 470, 460."
"15688270","15692650"," We know that there's a bunch of puts though sitting down at 425 for the 4-OPEX."
"15693630","15696870"," We saw this morning, we just want to give a heads up on this too, right?"
"15697430","15704830"," This morning we did see a large block come in against the spy at the open. "
"15706350","15707690"," We saw, what do we see come in?"
"15707890","15712330"," We saw March 7th, 442P, $2.6 million."
"15712870","15716450"," I don't know if that's the pin the market right now, if that's what that was used for, to intend"
"15716450","15717310"," to pin the market."
"15718270","15720150"," But somebody's got a large bet against the market right now. "
"15720190","15725690"," If we see cascading of those puts come in to match up with the 425 strike, it's not going to"
"15725690","15725950"," be pretty."
"15726570","15732050"," If we don't see that cascade waterfall of puts against the market and equity selling, then the"
"15732050","15735950"," market makers are not going to, the deal is not going to print those puts that are already down"
"15735950","15736190"," there."
"15736630","15742690"," There's a very low concentration of calls up at 460, so they prefer to print those, and they would"
"15742690","15746530"," print the 425s, the millions and millions of dollars that are down there. "
"15747350","15751290"," Car foreign France, they see food inflation, they load a mid-siggle digits."
"15753680","15756200"," So a lot of mixed signals inside the market right now currently."
"15757520","15760660"," There's probably some out there that are going to say, hey, this is going to be a non-news event. "
"15761400","15766160"," It's going to be nothing most minutes do have an immediate impact in the market."
"15766840","15769800"," Unlike the FOMC meetings, they tend to be a day later."
"15770800","15773540"," FOMC minutes tend to be almost reactionary immediately. "
"15774480","15780260"," And there's another idea behind this too that this is the trader's point of view, right, that"
"15780260","15785260"," doesn't check too much of a news, doesn't check, that doesn't care what whatever he says it should"
"15785260","15788620"," be, where the market is set up to just spring higher."
"15789020","15790660"," Like the market is just set right here to spring higher."
"15791240","15794520"," They'll manipulate the news to fit the narrative for the market to go higher here. "
"15795180","15796580"," So there's a bunch of different arguments."
"15797080","15798880"," I know you guys pay attention all over social media."
"15798880","15804140"," You watch YouTube videos and you guys have to make your own convictions of where we go. "
"15804580","15812080"," The easy trade, probably some Friday straddles, probably an easy trade, not too shabby."
"15812580","15816460"," If you really wanted to get weird, you could get some, if you think we're going to go to the"
"15816460","15819700"," depths of hell, I think the easier and the more profitable trade is lower."
"15821140","15828740"," Get yourself some putback spreads, they're free, and if we reverse them, don't go down there. "
"15829520","15835900"," They're going to pay for you and then you can get yourself some calls, some zero day calls to ride"
"15835900","15836500"," it all the way up."
"15837060","15840120"," You'll get, you'll break even or pay or get paid for those that trade."
"15841220","15845880"," Whether it goes up or down, you'll be protected and then you can trade it long on a dip. "
"15846960","15854900"," That would expect some weakness into the minutes being released unless someone knows something that"
"15854900","15855460"," we don't know."
"15856880","15859300"," But they expect some weakness and then we trade higher."
"15859500","15863140"," I think we trade higher today if you wanted a conviction from me. "
"15863740","15866240"," But do not trade against what I say, ever."
"15869170","15869990"," Junk, baby."
"15877130","15879070"," If you're getting killed by big dicks, me too. "
"15885200","15889700"," Yeah, if you guys see junk bonds and junk bonds have a bid today, which is kind of nice to"
"15889700","15893020"," see, you want to see a bid and junk bonds."
"15893380","15899000"," If you see that bid and junk bonds, if junk bonds move higher, you can expect the market to move"
"15899000","15900600"," up regardless of what the GEC says."
"15910010","15911590"," 282 viewers, whoof. "
"15912550","15919650"," Everybody wants to tune in during a market pivot, huh?"
"15919950","15920330"," Good job."
"15922730","15924290"," And we'll post something on Twitter."
"15925090","15927970"," You can get more watchers or followers or whatever. "
"15934370","15935350"," If we'll show you right."
"15937550","15951790"," I'd like to trade this by the S "
"15951790","15952330","&P."
"15955370","15956570"," He's joining us. "
"15959870","15960530"," All right."
"15960790","15963410"," See if we can get some weirdos in here."
"15964230","15965830"," You guys got your band hammers out?"
"15967690","15969250"," So you can ban hammer some people. "
"15976050","15977950"," We'll get the trolls coming in here at some point."
"15979050","15979370"," Okay."
"15981590","15982310"," Oh shit. "
"15982410","15983010"," Here we go."
"15984950","15986530"," We're going to make this a party, right?"
"15987770","15990970"," If you get to ban hammer out, Josh, Winky, you ready to go?"
"16003260","16004040"," All right."
"16007220","16010820"," This is going to be too funny. "
"16017920","16018640"," All right."
"16018900","16019320"," Post this."
"16040520","16041880"," Let's see what's going on. "
"16044200","16045000"," All right."
"16045280","16052200"," So let's just have a, let's just have a, let's just have a informal poll, right?"
"16053480","16055480"," Ultimately today, just heads up."
"16055580","16056320"," We got some spy puts. "
"16056660","16058000"," These are for a little while ago."
"16058560","16059280"," Not even much."
"16059500","16060820"," Let's get an informal poll going. "
"16063700","16066360"," Ukraine is mad about recognizing republics in eastern Ukraine."
"16067320","16068300"," We are the weirdos."
"16072900","16074820"," I want to ride the dicks with you. "
"16082200","16083680"," This is better than watching the target heads."
"16083680","16085720"," I had to see NBC when they tell you after the trade, right?"
"16087120","16087720"," All right."
"16087980","16092300"," So get just an informal poll real quick. "
"16093180","16097240"," Ultimately today, not where we swing high and then swing low or swing low, then swing high."
"16097960","16099520"," Ultimately, which way do we go?"
"16101140","16102640"," Let me know in the chat."
"16103020","16109620"," Just say we're going up or we're going down and we'll all take a just an informal feeling of the"
"16109620","16109860"," group. "
"16112200","16113440"," I think we go up."
"16115180","16116280"," I shouldn't have said that."
"16118040","16118780"," Let me know. "
"16119100","16121140"," Hey, Mike Guilford, thanks for supporting the channel."

"16148890","16149630"," Like the clap. "
"16150230","16154050"," Up, ultimately up."
"16154490","16156470"," Okay, big green candle and bleed the rest of the day."
"16156930","16157750"," Hey, that's a weird poll. "
"16157750","16158730"," That would suck, huh?"
"16161120","16161900"," Paul's got it right."
"16162880","16164900"," Paul's like big green candle and you trap everybody."

"16173810","16175710"," John knows what's up too, right?"
"16176130","16177470"," You have that talk about QT."
"16177550","16179870"," If they say, you don't forget the emergency meeting. "
"16179990","16184970"," If they just mention Zach, thanks for, thanks for supporting the channel."

"16196800","16197620"," Wow, that's a good one too. "
"16198380","16199280"," Down to Satan's basement."
"16200800","16202060"," Thanks for subscribing, Warren."
"16205230","16207310"," They can, yeah, they can. "
"16208190","16209090"," Yeah, that's the thing."
"16209110","16211190"," You guys are all like, what about an emergency fed meeting?"
"16211190","16214890"," I'll tell you what, there's like two things that'll drop this market, right?"
"16215150","16215550"," QT."
"16216990","16219710"," QT will drop this market faster than an emergency fed meeting. "
"16220270","16222330"," And you know what else would drop this market is?"
"16223490","16224310"," What's the other one?"
"16224710","16226710"," Yeah, we didn't show up to the bond market today."
"16228650","16230290"," The day, this is a fact."
"16230610","16233630"," The day the fed doesn't show up to the bond market. "
"16233970","16234510"," Good night."
"16238730","16239870"," Close the gap, then up."
"16239870","16241310"," Yeah, what about a VIX?"
"16241330","16242530"," I haven't even looked at VIX in a bit. "
"16243030","16245090"," We haven't closed the gap on the VIX, have we?"
"16248230","16249750"," I got to look at the..."
"16253040","16254760"," Yeah, there's that gap just sitting there."
"16254960","16256980"," 28, 25 is a gap."
"16257980","16259240"," I thought there was one that was higher. "
"16263040","16264840"," Well, there was one that was higher than 28, 25."
"16265180","16265600"," And you know what?"
"16265780","16267520"," Looking at the VIX, man, it's right in the middle, right?"
"16268460","16270260"," See it just trading right in the middle there."
"16280770","16281690"," Yeah, VIX is higher the day. "
"16281810","16282710"," We haven't closed that gap yet."
"16284070","16286130"," No panic selling yet, which is what we want, right?"
"16286370","16288230"," Either way, VIX, Y calls."
"16288430","16289330"," Paul's got a great point. "
"16297300","16298300"," That's not the high of the day."
"16298500","16299400"," I see that gap up."
"16299620","16300720"," Oh, no, this is today's gap. "
"16300880","16302100"," I'm talking about the gap from the other day."
"16302540","16303900"," There was a gap higher, right?"
"16304160","16305420"," In the 30s or something, I thought."
"16306900","16308260"," I'm not looking at it right now. "
"16308500","16309580"," I'm not a large screener."
"16309680","16311420"," I'm looking at it on a small screener right now."
"16313400","16315900"," It's like the ending of bond purchase and rate up. "
"16316060","16317860"," I've followed my QT, but we are data dependent."
"16317860","16319780"," Need to account for other central bank actions."
"16319780","16320700"," That's fair point, too. "
"16322950","16324450"," Yeah, zero volume today."
"16341470","16342450"," Okay, here we go."
"16346500","16347240"," Let's see here. "
"16347480","16350360"," Sorry, I think bond purchase or VIX is low of day and calm."
"16350560","16351460"," There will be zero volume."
"16351700","16352720"," There is zero, zero volume. "
"16352820","16354500"," Yeah, there was no volume yesterday as well, right?"
"16359330","16361230"," I think Joe didn't Joe sell the puts."
"16361610","16362010"," He should have."
"16365360","16366020"," Yeah, I agree. "
"16366180","16367920"," Main Street hasn't even showed a twinkie yet."
"16369160","16379010"," The VIX gap is at 31.60. I'm going to turn all this off"
"16379010","16380230"," and get set up for this trade."
"16381170","16390470"," Spy calls February 16th, 443C, 900 contracts at $1.38. It's only a block trade, though. "
"16393230","16402710"," If anybody's just joining us, we do usually get information sooner and faster than Twitter does."
"16403610","16406790"," We've got trade the news up and running."
"16410369","16415250"," You are correct out there, as the minutes are expected at 1,400 Eastern time. "
"16416090","16416669"," That's at 2 PM."
"16417849","16421310"," We usually get the information faster than most people get it."
"16421730","16424189"," It's not everybody, but enough people out there that get the information. "
"16424849","16429130"," We should get the FOMC minutes."
"16429790","16435450"," The key about trade the news too is you'll get a clean idea of what is important about the minutes,"
"16436029","16440290"," usually faster than Twitter and without the biased."
"16441570","16442529"," This is good. "
"16442710","16443150"," This is bad."
"16443349","16449630"," You want to hear if it's a negative or positive take on the minutes."
"16455740","16456939"," Yeah, that's a fair point. "
"16456939","16461300"," We should look at the volume today and see what the difference and volume will be into the close."
"16467279","16470939"," We're going to have to keep an eye on that number and that VIX number to see if the trade's"
"16470939","16473380"," higher than that 3160 before we go up or..."
"16477000","16478380"," Yeah, hey, Josh, what's your take?"

"16490939","16493360"," I want to know what Josh and Winky think the moves are today. "
"16495160","16498660"," They usually have pretty good insight into what they think is going to happen overall."
"16502130","16502869"," Because I think we get some weakness."
"16502869","16506970"," I think we get a little bit of weakness and unless there's unless someone knows the news already"
"16507650","16508750"," and then we trade higher. "
"16511900","16513080"," Johnny, what are you saying, brother?"

"16546509","16550689"," I think that the sentiment is bad."
"16551890","16555650"," So, yeah, it's 2 p.m. Usually you'll start seeing moves right now."
"16556310","16563290"," You should see some mark and move between now and 2 p.m. And we'll start to see some flow. "
"16563470","16566529"," We'll track the flow as it comes in and see where everybody stands here."
"16568860","16578340"," You've got some calls coming in at 443, two sets of calls on spy for the 16th, 443,"

"16602700","16605939"," Have your finger in the buy button and then trigger."
"16605939","16607259"," But I feel like I'm going to set that up. "
"16607680","16609099"," I haven't set that up yet."
"16611939","16612800"," Look at those."
"16614360","16616259"," Or look at those 445s. "
"16627759","16629020"," Unless we have a huge dip."
"16630060","16632439"," I'm not going to be in the short side yet."

"16683200","16683419"," flow."
"16684619","16686460"," It is from a flow algo."
"16687980","16689980"," I also have to hit certain data points. "
"16690180","16691119"," They have to be all buys."
"16691380","16691880"," There's no cells."
"16693160","16694400"," They have to be out of money or higher. "

"16713619","16714560"," Roughly between, right?"
"16715160","16717279"," Basically, everybody's doing straddles on 443."
"16725570","16725610"," Yeah."
"16725869","16730529"," So all this flow that comes in, it's like picked from, let's say you go to a normal flow site. "
"16730529","16733189"," You'll see a big vast amount of flow."
"16733890","16734930"," It's very directed."
"16735869","16741450"," It has to, they usually match it up to dark pull buys, equity buys, signature prints. "
"16750560","16752279"," You guys want to bring up TLT for you?"
"16752520","16753340"," I'll bring it up right now."

"16776960","16780500"," lot of the last 23 billion dollars in the bond auction."

"16795250","16795850"," as expected. "
"16796610","16799570"," But it said it would soon be appropriate to raise rates."
"16800230","16802810"," That set up the March meeting for the rate liftoff."
"16802990","16808170"," Since then, the debate has grown to whether the March hike would be 25 or 50 BPS. "
"16808750","16815610"," We know today that some of the voters and non voting members of the FED came out stating that they"
"16815610","16818950"," would support a 25 BPS increase, but not a 50."
"16819690","16824690"," One voter said they would support 25 BPS and not a 50 BPS rate increase."
"16827650","16828750"," That was Harker. "
"16829170","16835890"," Harker said that she wants a 25 BP rate increase in March, not 50 BPS, very supportive of starting"

"16843470","16844250"," monetary policy."
"16844950","16850810"," Start to raise that now and be supportive of as early as March 25 base point hike in that rate. "
"16851030","16854630"," We need to walk a fine line at the FED was how that ended."
"16854630","16863300"," This pie is starting to move up to 4409."
"16865840","16873600"," We have some hidden sellers above at 444.29. The here indicator is starting to turn up on the"

"16879970","16885570"," We'll get the FMC January minutes under the January 26 meeting."
"16885870","16893330"," The FMC left rates of hold as expected, but said they would soon be appropriate to raise rates. "
"16894070","16897170"," That set up March 4 rate liftoff."
"16898690","16905830"," Since then, FED has been over whether March rate hike should be 25 or 50 basis points with the"
"16905830","16912450"," leading hawk Bullard calling for 50 basis point hike, though deferring to Powell, who tends to be"
"16912450","16916870"," more moderate, and would likely favor a 25 basis point hike."

"19024950","19025750"," 75 cents."
"19026030","19026630"," You want to sell it?"
"19026730","19027470"," 70 cents. "
"19028970","19032430"," That has to be up another 10 cents for you to make our 10% profit."
"19035250","19036230"," I got to take my cut."
"19036890","19038390"," I'm going to make my money no matter what. "

"19065850","19066330"," 4470."
"19066930","19067890"," Look for that, okay?"
"19068370","19070010"," We are looking at the VIX dropping. "
"19070410","19072970"," It is going to look to tap out at 2455."
"19073690","19074950"," So we are close right now."
"19075070","19075790"," Be careful out there. "
"19083520","19089640"," You're going to find some form of support on the VIX at 2479, okay?"
"19089840","19093000"," Now you want to see it break through that 2479 for another leg higher."
"19093720","19094140"," Just be conscious."
"19094420","19096120"," Be watching the VIX agitrade in the spy. "
"19097440","19101600"," So 2479 is the beginning of some form of support for the VIX."
"19102860","19107280"," You want to see a breakthrough that number for the spy to move higher."
"19110710","19112170"," Because everybody doing Robert, good to see you. "
"19112610","19113470"," All day was a grind."
"19114890","19116630"," We made two good trades though."
"19116950","19121330"," We made it the trade earlier for the short on spy and the long trade on the spy later today. "
"19122090","19124050"," But standing around for eight hours sucks."
"19125210","19126790"," Usually it's way more faster."
"19130520","19131400"," You do nothing. "
"19131400","19131680"," You do nothing."
"19136920","19138440"," Why is it the spy?"
"19138700","19141300"," We can't pump the spy or dump the spy."
"19141520","19144360"," It's not like we have any influence over what happens on the spy. "
"19145620","19147760"," It's not like we're pumping penny stocks around here."
"19147940","19149820"," Telling you to buy a meal at $5 or something."
"19150680","19153640"," Nice quick bounce real quick on 44580. "
"19158550","19159890"," Nice bounce on the spy."
"19169310","19170510"," Hey Joey, how are you doing?"
"19170650","19171330"," Rather good to see you."
"19172150","19174050"," Let's be opposed into positive territory. "
"19174050","19175150"," We have one to the one percent."

"19239740","19243020"," We're going to take a look here and see if they're going to reverse off the top here or not. "
"19243340","19243720"," See these guys?"

"19249740","19252180"," We'll look to see if these guys are actually here or not."
"19253940","19255700"," We're just going to blast through resistance."
"19259180","19260600"," Let's see if we'll blast through. "
"19261420","19262220"," Move higher."
"19262720","19266440"," From the low today, we're down at 4197."
"19267320","19269600"," Now trading at 447-06. "
"19274670","19275830"," Tesla's entering..."
"19275830","19279230"," J&K is catching a huge bid in the market right now."

"19282570","19283630"," Huge bid. "
"19285370","19287630"," Just blast off right there for the spy."
"19288850","19289870"," Blast off."
"19290570","19298570"," If we break through 447, next price target above is going to be 449, I think, 450. "
"19299230","19300990"," Take a look higher and see where it is."
"19304490","19306310"," Yeah, next stop is 449."
"19306970","19310250"," We've got some sneaky sellers up here at 447-48. "
"19311010","19312590"," And then 448-97."
"19318790","19320130"," Beautiful move on the spy."
"19321090","19324950"," AMD calls, spy calls, spy calls, February 16th. "

"19338610","19340410"," Tons of them coming in on the spy right now."
"19340570","19342150"," Tons of calls coming in on the Apple as well. "
"19345140","19346380"," 448, new price target."
"19347500","19348460"," See if we can get there today."
"19355620","19356460"," No, we won't miss it. "
"19356600","19358060"," We'll probably push up and through it."
"19359540","19361260"," Volatility trigger starts at 447."
"19362500","19366620"," But the ceiling, the call ceiling is at 450 currently. "
"19367380","19373000"," We want to see more calls, expansion of calls, into the market with farther updates higher, right?"
"19373240","19375200"," Like 460, 470, 480."
"19376280","19381520"," It doesn't mean we trade that high, but you need to raise the call wall so that you can trade"
"19381520","19381920"," to 460."
"19383700","19387860"," If you don't raise that call wall, if you don't see calls coming in, call expansion. "
"19389420","19396280"," You'll potentially see us trade to 4470, 4500, and then trade sideways into expiry."
"19396960","19402260"," So they're not paying out as much money into anybody that's holding all those puts way down deep at"
"19402260","19402420"," 425."
"19405280","19406860"," So you're looking for call expansion. "
"19407460","19410980"," If you don't find call expansion, we will trade sideways at some point."
"19415440","19421840"," Yep, nice big fat support formed here at 446 and 444, 445, 80."
"19427080","19429660"," Josh says they called bad news and then jumped to 450. "
"19432960","19434900"," You guys all making money out there today, right?"
"19435240","19439640"," Hopefully, hopefully should be making some money."
"19446430","19447910"," This is a good day today."
"19450060","19452240"," We'll look to see, I would have calls right now. "
"19452340","19454900"," I'm going to look to be trying to grab some calls here."
"19454980","19456180"," We can catch a bounce down here."
"19456640","19458240"," See you right where we are right now. "
"19458240","19460180"," We're going to catch a bounce down here."
"19460640","19461800"," See this wall over here?"
"19462100","19465580"," Buyers, 60,000 buyers at 446."
"19466760","19470800"," So if we can catch a little bit of a nice rip up again, now we're going to look for"
"19470800","19471400"," another rip higher. "
"19472040","19472940"," Take another shot at it."
"19478390","19480490"," So we'll look to see if we can catch one more on the right up."
"19482620","19484300"," Look for a bounce down here in 446. "
"19485040","19486600"," See those buyers down there just waiting?"
"19487880","19489160"," Just praying and waiting."
"19490620","19500450"," In pray right now, the buyers just waiting down there to grab some."
"19506120","19508540"," Just waiting for an opportunity to go along here. "
"19512870","19514650"," I'm going to snag some more calls at 447."
"19515570","19518030"," If we don't break through right here, we're going to look right here."
"19518130","19520650"," Okay, we want to see that we don't break through right here, the support area. "
"19521190","19526250"," Keep your eyes on these buyers here where they were at 80,000, and they're down at 60 and 70"
"19526250","19527150"," and 80,000."
"19527750","19532010"," We'll look for the buyers to swoop in right here and see if they take this thing along in once"
"19532010","19532290"," again."
"19532450","19536230"," Okay, you don't want to see a rug pull down here. "
"19536230","19539710"," You want to see buyers just swoop in and start buying."
"19539870","19545290"," You're looking for like 80, 90,000 or not, dollar blocks of buying."
"19545490","19546490"," So staying here, okay. "
"19547210","19548350"," Just keep your eyes forward."
"19548990","19551910"," Look at the market right now and look to see if we can get a nice dip on."
"19558120","19558980"," Good, heads up. "
"19559120","19559640"," Oh, who said that?"
"19559860","19560760"," Was that Mary that said that?"
"19562200","19566300"," Who said some envy of thanks, as he for saying some Nvidia earnings are after the bell."
"19566540","19574950"," Also, looking for a little crash through here."
"19575470","19576890"," We're at a bit of rug pulling going on. "
"19576890","19579170"," There's what 80,000 buyers down here at 446."
"19579370","19580270"," We want to see if this can hold."
"19580730","19585430"," If this can hold, we're going to probably buy a call into Friday here. "
"19586070","19587070"," Let's see if this holds."
"19591220","19594660"," Watching the VIX looks like it's starting to break through that support."
"19595300","19598900"," If we can get some more breaking of the VIX here, we should get another leg higher. "
"19606050","19608390"," All you know is Tesla's green, maybe, right on Dylan."
"19610900","19613960"," That Christian's like, pull the rug, pull the rug."
"19617960","19619020"," Pull the rug. "
"19620800","19622540"," Christian's like, pull it now."
"19629080","19630140"," Pull the rug."
"19633780","19636380"," APP calls coming in February 18th. "
"19636980","19640240"," I don't know if that we were looking at somewhere, looking at APPS earlier, were we not APP?"
"19641980","19643580"," Let's see if this support holds."
"19646520","19648660"," Here are indicators trending down right now."
"19648860","19650260"," Watch this purple line over time. "
"19651080","19652370"," See this purple line going now."
"19652370","19654590"," Looking for this to turn back up again to grab calls."
"19655550","19658670"," Always focus on this purple line when I'm talking to you guys out there. "
"19662550","19664210"," You want to see that curling up."
"19665130","19668350"," You want to see the numbers over here turning up."
"19668350","19669670"," They're right there at 80,000. "
"19669690","19673790"," You want to see them good back to that 50, 60, 80,000 buyer zone."
"19688550","19690210"," Yeah, PT for Friday."
"19690670","19693190"," I'm going to give a PT tomorrow of 450. "
"19696570","19700930"," And then I'll look for trade sideways or down into Friday."
"19702170","19708710"," I'm at that 450 price target."
"19715270","19717730"," Here are indicators starting to turn back up slightly. "
"19717830","19718810"," Let's see if we can hold it."
"19720390","19721950"," Buy program is on."
"19724430","19725650"," J&K is ripping. "
"19725970","19728410"," Just so you guys know, it doesn't matter what Spy's doing right now."
"19729310","19730550"," J&K is ripping."
"19734680","19735620"," It's all scammed. "
"19735760","19736440"," It's about to get flushed."
"19740740","19743040"," Just keep your eyes on J&K, okay?"
"19744260","19745860"," Keep your eyes on J&K."
"19746120","19747500"," We are in risk on right now. "
"19748400","19752100"," Even if there's temporary weakness right now, we are in risk on."
"19752360","19753260"," Even if it's for the day."
"19758700","19759700"," I don't know. "
"19759840","19761180"," I've got our OPEC's gases here."
"19761680","19763620"," So we'll wait and see for tomorrow and we'll bring it up."
"19766890","19768170"," Josh wants mod status. "
"19772690","19773350"," Where's Josh?"
"19773550","19774090"," We'll make him a mod."
"19774570","19775370"," He's been here long enough."
"19775850","19778830"," It ends up getting the original founders of this stuff. "
"19778970","19779850"," They're all going to be mods."
"19780450","19781590"," Like the original 100."
"19781850","19783390"," Everybody's a mod banning each other. "
"19787890","19789750"," Everybody's a mod now."
"19793250","19793670"," Bam."
"19794490","19796310"," All right, you're a fucking tool, Josh. "
"19800060","19801500"," You're a fucking tool now."
"19804640","19805980"," You have to change your name, Josh."
"19813090","19815130"," We have a double tool now. "
"19819240","19820620"," We'll see if we break through here."
"19820700","19822640"," It looks like there's a little bit of a rug pulling here."
"19822640","19824560"," You want to see this pickup higher. "
"19827940","19831360"," If you want to look for if you are a bear and you want to look for a trade lower"
"19831360","19834400"," from where we are, we'll look at that."
"19839530","19848450"," VWAP is down at 44.3.84. And see if we can find"
"19848450","19851230"," there's a lot of buyers down here."
"19851790","19854490"," Let me take it to VWAP if you wanted to take it that low. "
"19855550","19857210"," A lot of traffic down here."
"19868200","19870860"," See if we can look closer here and see where VWAP is."
"19871780","19877510"," Let's see if there's a better, maybe a VWAP trade. "
"19881340","19893100"," VWAP's at 44.3.87. Probably"
"19893100","19894500"," be the best guess on it right now."
"19895640","19899680"," We'll keep it right here so we can watch what the hair and the care are saying for when to"
"19899680","19900060"," buy the dip."
"19901860","19908010"," Buy the dip toolbox, Josh. "
"19910890","19915210"," I love the Josh's."
"19916130","19918230"," It seems to be more of a FOMO chase."
"19918470","19919590"," A volcrush in real buying. "
"19919830","19921270"," Not sure what fundamentals have changed."
"19922230","19924750"," Well, the volatility in the market has changed."
"19925250","19931090"," Right now, we've been told that there's nothing unexpected to be stated at this point. "
"19934530","19936070"," Also, there's no hay."
"19936230","19938190"," We're going to 100 BP's."
"19939690","19942050"," That question has been removed at this point. "
"19945260","19947420"," That we've priced in where we're going."
"19948120","19950160"," Has been reaffirmed at this point."
"19950440","19954480"," Now that we will look back on March 2nd, I mentioned something earlier. "
"19954480","19958340"," I'll bring this up for you guys, especially bears out there need this date for sure."
"19960600","19963180"," I see they can get a date and what they're trying to say."
"19963740","19965780"," They said something about the second. "
"19968330","19973250"," I'm not seeing it here, but there is something about the second that we need to know."
"19974770","19979070"," Let me take a look at this for you guys."
"19986620","19987680"," Something about the second. "
"19987880","19995200"," I'm not seeing the actual date, but he did mention something about possible policy change."
"19995260","19996080"," Don't hold me to that."
"20001570","20002770"," And now trading out of 445. "
"20003950","20004990"," I'm looking to buy something."
"20005370","20008670"," I don't know if it's now or if it's 244 in the afternoon."
"20009250","20011030"," We have another hour and 15 minutes left. "
"20011030","20017730"," I'll be looking to buy some longs into Friday for sure, wherever we wind up."
"20018270","20024770"," We did pin strike above at 447.21. We know that is the volatility trigger, right?"
"20025430","20025910"," 4470."
"20026710","20028810"," We discussed that at Nazim today. "
"20029650","20032030"," The call wall is at 4500."
"20033250","20035630"," So we're going to be looking for a bid into the market."
"20036230","20039790"," Let's see if we can trade up to 4500, excuse me, into Friday. "
"20047010","20048730"," Yeah, Putin bought the fucking dip, huh?"
"20048930","20050390"," Jesus, it's terrible."
"20054680","20057040"," A little birthday surprise from the Fed for me."
"20057420","20057880"," Right on, right on. "
"20058020","20058900"," Hope you guys made money today."
"20061840","20064020"," It should be a fairly simple trade in the Friday."
"20067150","20068970"," Doesn't matter if it's a spread. "
"20069830","20072290"," There should be a fairly simple trade into Friday."
"20074050","20075370"," Or at least into Thursday."
"20075710","20076230"," I wouldn't say Friday. "
"20076470","20078870"," I would say it's only into Thursday at some point."
"20078970","20080010"," Probably a gap up overnight."
"20080010","20083110"," Lots of it. "
"20083210","20086410"," I mean, even where we are right now, they interest the loan on 450Cs."
"20087210","20089250"," So 450Cs were a dollar earlier."
"20090130","20093390"," And they're now up to $1.44 just on premium kick. "
"20094210","20098450"," So we could trade back from here, but there are bulls out there."
"20098570","20101410"," I think we're going to 450, at least on a gap up tomorrow."
"20102290","20103570"," And that's when they'll do it, right?"
"20104030","20105410"," They won't do it in cash market. "
"20105710","20108170"," They'll do it inside of the after hours."
"20108430","20110570"," So after hours, inside of the overnight."
"20111390","20112490"," They'll push it up. "
"20113470","20115230"," Where cash can't get it done."
"20122890","20123690"," Yeah, exactly."
"20124310","20125690"," Exactly the real Fed Chair. "
"20127270","20127990"," There we go."
"20128110","20129330"," Thanks, Tom, for setting that up."
"20129430","20129470"," Right?"
"20129630","20131470"," Balance sheet is on March 2nd. "
"20134450","20135930"," Thanks for the heads up, Tom."
"20137150","20142530"," Yeah, they did say something about the balance sheet being an important date."
"20143070","20145410"," Vix is starting to dump a little bit through right here. "
"20148790","20150930"," Here are indicators kind of wonky right now."
"20150970","20152150"," I'm not sure if I would trust it."
"20152150","20157550"," As a bull, you want a little bit of a better, a better hay we're going up from here. "
"20165920","20169020"," Don't give your money back to the market makers."
"20169260","20170780"," This is where they take your money away from you."
"20172020","20173600"," But this is the place, right?"
"20173780","20175280"," They're like, oh, we're going to take these guys' money. "
"20175600","20176520"," These women's money."
"20177520","20179080"," We're going to take all their gains back."
"20179280","20180060"," We're going to suck them dry. "
"20180860","20182880"," Just give it a chill, let it chill for a little bit."
"20183920","20189220"," Iran's adopted nuclear negotiator is saying that after weeks of intensive talks, they're closer"
"20189220","20190420"," than ever to an agreement."
"20190920","20192160"," And that goes to those comments. "
"20192780","20194300"," And some European officials earlier."
"20195420","20197440"," Don't give away your gains from now."
"20197740","20199840"," Remember that the interest will burn off calls. "
"20200040","20206140"," It could be going up into the bell, and you'll still see the price of your calls go down."
"20206880","20209080"," The initial excitement starts to wear off."
"20209820","20214260"," You've got trainers out there like me that are waiting to buy the clothes here. "
"20214760","20218960"," And so we want to get our calls as cheap as possible, right?"
"20219380","20222700"," So the money was made and the initial move down below."
"20223680","20229080"," And so you've got some sharks out there, and you've got market makers that want to suck some money"
"20229080","20229320"," off."
"20229840","20230980"," So just be careful. "
"20232970","20237430"," Even if we trade higher tomorrow, it's going to be just take your time."
"20238190","20240330"," Keep your eyes on the on the hero indicator."
"20242470","20244390"," You're gonna be waiting for a dip buy. "
"20249970","20250830"," We're in the army."
"20251290","20252970"," Just need some tanks to control the casino."
"20254970","20262980"," Yeah, the Iran nuclear deal is bearish for oil. "
"20263200","20263920"," Well, I don't know, is it?"
"20265240","20269740"," Do you think that Iran nuclear deal has something to have a different pipeline other than Russia?"
"20271100","20272900"," I think that's part of that deal, Jeremy."
"20273100","20275960"," I haven't been paying too closely to the Iran deal."
"20279940","20282740"," My thought would be that it has something to do with Russia and Ukraine. "
"20288280","20289800"," By scam do you mean free money?"
"20295150","20297210"," Some spy dip buyers stepping in."
"20297590","20301570"," February 18, 450 C's, $64,000."
"20302830","20305110"," So that's February 18, 450 C, right?"
"20305910","20308570"," They're buying them for $1.24. I think you can get them cheaper. "
"20311750","20313050"," I'm not sure if I'm a buyer here yet."
"20313050","20318570"," But I'm waiting for, uh, I'm waiting for bargain basement prices."
"20322320","20326900"," And whoever called this out earlier, whoever was talking, you guys look at this, right?"
"20327060","20328040"," Look at the spy down here. "
"20328220","20333600"," We had that bullshit top gun sell off down to 4, 4, 1, 9, 4."
"20333980","20336860"," And sure, then shit, where was the dip buy the second time?"
"20337680","20339940"," 4, 4, 2, 0, 4."
"20340660","20341700"," Outer horseshit."
"20343660","20347400"," Just like a, just like a 4X fishing expedition, right?"
"20349020","20353820"," Like some bank says, oh, we got the minutes early and we're going to buy here, no matter what"
"20353820","20357580"," happens, scam, baby."
"20362040","20363500"," Yeah, I was making a good point. "
"20364420","20365780"," Everybody's long oil, right?"
"20366100","20367660"," There are so many people."
"20368140","20370480"," It's like a pyramid scheme with that scam at this point."
"20370680","20371360"," I think it's going higher. "
"20375470","20387390"," No, no, my point behind Iran is that, uh, my point behind Iran is that they'll"
"20387390","20395690"," use Iran for oil instead of Russia in case the Russian pipeline is put on hold, another source."
"20400350","20402950"," Yeah, the top gun sell off was the call, wasn't it?"
"20403590","20405270"," Was that you cowboy up to did that?"
"20405710","20408110"," Somebody in here, we, we, we traded that play."
"20409190","20412950"," And then someone shouted out, they said, I bet that was the dip buy for the banks. "
"20414410","20415750"," Sure enough, it was, right?"
"20421190","20422490"," Pretty good day out there today."
"20422670","20423290"," Good money-making."
"20427020","20429740"," Piss off all, piss off all the Twitter traders out there. "
"20459410","20460130"," Crazy, crazy."
"20460430","20460790"," Well, run here."
"20465860","20466640"," Crazy, crazy, crazy. "
"20467540","20469020"," Okay, we got some support down here."
"20470580","20471660"," Who are we looking at here?"
"20472880","20477120"," Support down here, 445.12. You guys want to have a whiskey?"
"20478280","20479220"," You guys want to have a beer?"
"20480340","20481360"," So what could do be drink some water?"
"20483500","20485180"," Wifey's pig folio was under fire."
"20487880","20489440"," You're a boomer right on. "
"20507480","20508640"," What do you say maverick?"
"20508840","20510240"," Maverick inverted, look, did it?"
"20512260","20513460"," Yeah, time for a dooby."
"20513640","20514560"," Hot tea here for Mary."
"20522900","20524020"," Yeah, so that was my question. "
"20524220","20528120"," Is the Iran deal any, is the Iran deal tied into Europe getting oil or not?"
"20533510","20534810"," I'm not familiar with it."
"20534890","20535430"," That's why I'm asking."
"20538790","20541710"," I was shorting the UVXY say was buying TQQ. "
"20542110","20542270"," No."
"20547110","20548530"," Rice boyfriends, I could smoke some."
"20551050","20553670"," Robert's already been drinking at dinner. "
"20554430","20555090"," That sounds delicious."
"20555310","20559130"," I want a fat steak tonight for dinner, but I haven't had a steak in a long time, and I"
"20559130","20559530"," want one tonight."
"20561670","20563930"," All this news is noise for crude. "
"20564090","20565450"," It's going to find something to drive it up."
"20565450","20566730"," I ran China-Russia next week."
"20567170","20567550"," I don't know. "
"20567670","20568690"," I haven't been paying attention to that."
"20568690","20570910"," I should be paying more attention to the old trade."
"20572170","20572870"," Thanks, Lovey. "
"20575230","20579110"," Oh, yeah."
"20579430","20579830"," You know what?"
"20581210","20582170"," I've tried gummies."
"20582870","20583670"," Those things for me. "
"20590570","20591550"," No, it's not about Russia."
"20593250","20594610"," We should get one of you guys on it."
"20594890","20596630"," Do any of you guys trade oil a lot?"
"20596770","20598930"," I should get Stepping Stone Trader in here to talk about oil. "
"20602050","20603050"," Sweet cold cowboy."
"20607340","20609080"," Yeah, I've had a steak in forever."
"20612910","20614130"," You enjoying the T-Wave?"
"20618470","20620290"," Yeah, I've got some great steaks. "
"20621410","20622270"," I've got a great butcher."
"20622490","20624410"," I've got him sitting in the refrigerator right now waiting for me."
"20625190","20626070"," Some New York strips. "
"20626710","20631490"," They are like this thick, like an inch and a half thick."
"20635900","20638020"," Are we getting warm today?"
"20638240","20638800"," Well, no, it was blowing."
"20638960","20639780"," Yeah, it was cold yesterday. "
"20641300","20642700"," Are we getting a foot of snow tomorrow?"
"20643200","20644000"," Are you shitting me?"
"20644240","20645460"," I'm going to take the day off tomorrow."
"20648600","20650200"," Is it really going to snow tomorrow?"
"20650500","20651240"," Because I'll ski tomorrow."
"20652300","20653080"," What do you guys think?"
"20653200","20654380"," I'm going to take the day off tomorrow or no?"
"20654780","20655120"," Oh, yeah. "
"20658060","20659060"," Yeah, so I let you."
"20659120","20661000"," My favorite steak is New York strip."
"20662760","20663840"," Like I'm out of Chicago. "
"20664880","20666160"," Get my steak out of Chicago."
"20666920","20671420"," And what I'll do is I'll not quite Pittsburgh them, but I blast them on like 800 degree heat."
"20672080","20673660"," Just char the fuck out of them. "
"20675060","20681080"," I'll serve them with some white truffles, some brown butter, cracked pepper, and salt."
"20685080","20688420"," I start with some champagne, believe it or not, or some bubbles."
"20691440","20692900"," The market maker's bad. "
"20695280","20697160"," Is it 50s tomorrow with heavy rain and freeze up?"
"20702140","20707100"," If I can get my hands on some fresh mushrooms, saute those bad boys."
"20707260","20707800"," That one, that's saute."
"20708080","20709800"," I might try to try to brown them. "
"20710920","20716180"," Just brown them, deglaze the pan, hit it with some beef stock."
"20717900","20719600"," Oil industry got to ask hand to it during pandemic."
"20720280","20720920"," Yeah, I agree with that. "
"20721960","20723280"," I agree they're out for blood too."
"20723280","20724240"," Crit that part I know."
"20726660","20728400"," Parts of the oil trade I know. "
"20728640","20729340"," I don't know all of it."
"20731000","20732160"," Lucy, you do the Suvi?"
"20732440","20733140"," I used to do Suvi."
"20733880","20734520"," I love Suvi. "
"20735060","20738860"," I like Suvi's steak to an extent sometimes."
"20740360","20741640"," But now I just blast it."
"20742200","20743220"," Sixties with rain. "
"20743660","20744340"," Man, that's a nice weekend."
"20746680","20747860"," I love Morells."
"20748300","20752980"," I used to pick Morells up in Colorado and in Santa Fe of all places, believe it or not. "
"20755560","20762940"," VXX puts May 20th, 16 P, 840,000 dollars."
"20764740","20766820"," Hero indicators starting to pick up slightly."
"20767520","20773340"," Some calls on February 16th, 447 C, 29,000 dollars. "
"20787520","20789960"," I'm going to do a little bit of a bit back in the spy again."
"20797810","20798490"," Am I able?"
"20799090","20799630"," Yeah."
"20800590","20803290"," Of course. "
"20804410","20805350"," I got to be."
"20805990","20806990"," Whatever you need."
"20807510","20807850"," I love you. "
"20810710","20812090"," Oh yeah, man."
"20812710","20814310"," Suvi Tri-tip is butter."
"20815210","20816250"," I love duck Suvi. "
"20821990","20823290"," Yeah, I got to finish it on the grill."
"20823450","20826350"," I got to finish all a beef or grill."
"20826510","20827170"," Nope, never heard of it. "
"20828450","20830230"," I used, you know what a reverse sear is?"
"20832670","20837390"," I'll reverse sear prime rib, like roasts."
"20839250","20840770"," May I give him a spy back again?"
"20840970","20841630"," Just beast mode."
"20843250","20844830"," Buy every dip on the spy. "
"20848480","20852420"," I like taking a rib roast, right?"
"20852640","20854620"," And I'll reverse sear it."
"20856640","20858660"," I'll go, I'll go, well, that'll reverse sear it."
"20858800","20860000"," So I've reversed their steaks before. "
"20860160","20863060"," I'll do it in a rib roast as I'll sear the shit out of it, right?"
"20863680","20869000"," And then I'll cook it at a really low temperature, like 205 degrees, forever and ever."
"20870020","20871800"," And then I'll sear it one more time."
"20872540","20872840"," Let it rest. "
"20873280","20874020"," Let the juices rest."
"20874540","20876280"," And then I'll slam that bad boy again."
"20879020","20880960"," The cues is lagging the spy, huh?"
"20888890","20890030"," Nice heads up, Winky. "
"20897400","20899440"," Yeah, 1500 degrees where you want it."
"20899660","20902660"," Like 800 to sometimes they can get up to like 1200."
"20904280","20908300"," But most of the time I can only get like 800, 900 degrees somewhere in there. "
"20915060","20920080"," I've been short, short and day, short oil all morning high as the next of the afternoon."
"20922910","20923690"," Yeah, I like ribeye."
"20923830","20924150"," I like ribeye. "
"20924290","20924970"," I like the ribeye roast."
"20926830","20928090"," Doesn't that sound good to have steak?"
"20929890","20932110"," Have some more resistance coming in above."
"20932390","20933450"," Just be careful of this trade. "
"20933670","20934970"," I don't think this is the end of the day trade."
"20937050","20939060"," 446 86, excuse me."
"20941770","20943450"," Hey, Mary, cheers to you with your teeth. "
"20944290","20945070"," Cheers to you, Mary."
"20952140","20953080"," Hey, hack trend."
"20953280","20954920"," You know what the best steaks have been getting right now, we're at?"
"20956920","20958000"," I kid you not. "
"20959820","20961200"," Better than butcher steaks."
"20962540","20967620"," I've been buying steaks at more apple calls, spy calls and video calls."
"20967840","20968400"," Winky made a comment. "
"20968400","20972780"," There's a lot of calls coming into, coming into tech right now."
"20975720","20977040"," Lots of calls on apple."
"20978640","20979480"," You buy the roast?"
"20983300","20984440"," Oh, yeah, doesn't it?"
"20984520","20984860"," We a wizard?"
"20987360","20991860"," You know, I used to like the Costco steaks, but not for the price. "
"20992760","21000360"," So what I've been doing to save money on steaks is I buy the New York strips and the rib"
"21000360","21005220"," eyes, the Angus beef steaks from Aldi."
"21005540","21007160"," Like I'll load up on them, throw them in the freezer."
"21008180","21010280"," They're like 15 bucks for two steaks. "
"21011480","21015660"," And they're some of the best steak I've had from a store, not a butcher, but a store."
"21016760","21021160"," So go to Aldi if you can and get their New York strips or rib eyes."
"21021480","21023260"," You'll be shocked at how dang good they are. "
"21027330","21028610"," Very expensive, greed driving."
"21028610","21030830"," Got to make the money back, capitalism and overdrive."
"21030950","21032530"," Yeah, I agree with that, Christian. "
"21037090","21039650"," Like the Aldi New York strippers are amazing."
"21041590","21043530"," First, I don't know why they're so good."
"21043990","21052570"," A lot of the meat from Aldi, I don't eat, but like during the pandemic for some reason, I bought"
"21052570","21055110"," or my wife or I bought some steaks from Aldi. "
"21055210","21056850"," I don't know who did or I ordered them online."
"21057090","21059570"," I don't know exactly what took place, but I never had them before."
"21060190","21063310"," So I had them and I was shocked at how delicious they were. "
"21071870","21077300"," Trust me, I guarantee it, they're good."
"21078720","21081860"," And I've eaten steak at some of the best steak houses in the country."
"21084120","21085820"," Like big steak houses. "
"21090100","21093100"," Hey, Mike, I got to say something to you, my man."
"21093780","21095540"," I got to say something to you, brother."
"21096180","21098000"," We talked about you this morning. "
"21099040","21100900"," I caught your video last night."
"21101540","21106380"," And I told my guys about what you were saying about HYG, my brother."
"21107040","21108960"," All right, HYG about J and K."
"21110320","21112220"," And we got to thank you, my man. "
"21113240","21117700"," Because we tracked J and K against the FOMC today."
"21118520","21120560"," And we made bank, brother."
"21121980","21123320"," You are the man. "
"21124520","21127000"," Make sure you're all following, figuring out money."
"21127620","21128480"," Mike the Silva."
"21132070","21133830"," Because he helped us today. "
"21134790","21138910"," He had a video out last night where he was talking about J and K."
"21140310","21143170"," And so I went down the rabbit hole on J and K last night."
"21144030","21145690"," And I was like, he's got it."
"21145890","21147210"," He knows what he's talking about. "
"21147450","21149470"," I mean, talk about some of the knows what they're talking about."
"21150110","21151710"," You guys want to do some DD."
"21152230","21156310"," Be following and watching, figuring out money's videos every single night. "
"21158870","21168170"," Bro, I traded the spy today long off J and K, leading indicator on the spy today."
"21168930","21169870"," You are the man."
"21171510","21173130"," You are the man, brother. "
"21173230","21176390"," I talked about you all day long in the in the in the feed today."
"21176690","21178110"," Been talking about you since this morning."
"21179990","21181110"," You are the man. "
"21183170","21184170"," Trust me."
"21185670","21186950"," You are the man, bro."
"21186950","21188770"," That was the indicator today. "
"21189250","21190610"," You nailed it, brother."
"21191670","21193550"," You nailed it today."
"21196280","21197100"," Yeah, not only subscribe. "
"21197500","21199740"," Hit the alert button on figuring out money."
"21200540","21203060"," Does a thorough job of looking at the markets."
"21204660","21209460"," Spy now trading up to 44 7.60. Same places before. "
"21209740","21212700"," That's a few futures pushing up against the highs of the day here."
"21212700","21220260"," 44 75 and as that composite of seven, we have seen short term two year yields come off the lows"
"21220260","21226600"," post FOMC minutes at 1.53%. That we are down a couple basis points in the two year and that"
"21226600","21231860"," spread to the 10 year remains wider by about five on the day, holding about 50 basis points in the"
"21231860","21232860"," 210 year spread."
"21233920","21236040"," New highs being printed out on the S&P futures. "
"21237360","21239740"," Three to major U.S. indices in positive territory."
"21239740","21241380"," The dollar index is lower by."
"21243550","21245370"," And the VIX is now lower on the day. "
"21246530","21253390"," Now breaking into that volatility trigger again higher than before at 44 7.0. We are now deep into"
"21253390","21256790"," the volatility trigger and into it by about 68 cents."
"21257470","21260730"," Price target above is still this trade might be over again once more."
"21261250","21263910"," Just be conscious of the sellers entering the market at this point. "
"21264550","21266610"," Take your prop money and run at resistance, right?"
"21267190","21269050"," Wait for the banks to do your job for you."
"21269050","21273650"," Let them bring it over the volatility trigger and then we'll look for another price target higher"
"21273650","21274230"," to 450."
"21275230","21279930"," Otherwise, the trade will come back down and we'll take that trade again into Friday. "
"21283150","21283830"," Yeah, man."
"21284010","21284690"," I appreciate it, Mike."
"21284910","21287470"," Dude, that was some great due diligence last night, my man. "
"21288030","21290350"," Like, I can't tell you like that was insane."
"21290670","21292670"," You nailed it, bro."
"21293930","21295050"," You really did. "
"21295350","21296410"," You really nailed it."
"21297010","21300210"," We risk on and we risk off and you saw that big coming to J&K."
"21300670","21302750"," And it was like, boom, you knew it was happening. "
"21307350","21308190"," So Mike posited."
"21308310","21315290"," He was talking about the long-term charts on J&K and where support was on junk bonds."
"21315990","21320710"," And if you look over time going back as far, you can go back as far as like 2015-2018. "
"21321270","21327070"," And you can see if we trade off of trade down at our current level on J&K that we"
"21327070","21330190"," become even more risk off than we are currently, right?"
"21330190","21336650"," And we've had some significant drops below current levels on J&K have led to significant declines"
"21336650","21339370"," in the market from that point forward."
"21340290","21346330"," So the point being is if J&K ends up dumping, there would be something in the market mechanics"
"21346330","21352390"," underneath the hood that are showing you outside of the regular equities market that the banks are"
"21352390","21355610"," risk off heading into today's minutes."
"21356110","21360170"," And then also the market in general, right?"
"21360170","21360730"," Junk bonds. "
"21361310","21364430"," But a bid did come into J&K this morning or this afternoon."
"21364430","21366330"," They traded down at one point today."
"21367210","21372750"," Well, they didn't trade down, but they opened the day at $1.304 and they've just been ripping. "
"21373290","21378350"," You can actually see the moment today at two o'clock where there was a quick dip and then we"
"21378350","21381790"," had a reversal candle to trade higher."
"21382410","21385370"," So again, we talked about taking your profits here, right?"
"21385570","21386490"," Take some profit here."
"21386890","21389970"," Let the banks do the work for you to send us over the volatility level. "
"21390170","21393770"," You want to see this area right here disappear, right?"
"21393910","21394830"," All this ice go away."
"21395090","21399010"," You want to see in the dome, you want to see the buyers, right?"
"21399390","21401770"," Step up a little bit more than these sellers over here."
"21401830","21404610"," 40,000 sellers, 40,000 buyers down here. "
"21404610","21405890"," You want to see a wave of buyers."
"21406390","21410250"," You want to see the hero indicator start to move higher as well."
"21410450","21414210"," So the inherent indicator is a leading indicator that we're trading back slightly at this moment. "
"21415930","21417430"," Yeah, Mike is the dude, man."
"21417430","21424650"," So Mike, he talked about, talking about the J&K talked about mortgages, right?"
"21425310","21428930"," I think it was, I figure what the other ticker was that he was looking at yesterday."
"21431240","21436580"," But some key information that nobody else was talking about was Mike Silly yesterday. "
"21437080","21438320"," So follow that guy."
"21439280","21446500"," Very intelligent, very smart, gives you the tools to use in your day trade."
"21447040","21448860"," Part of my every day due diligence. "
"21459590","21460890"," Justin, thanks for subscribing."
"21461290","21463370"," Level warm, warm, warm, thank you for subscribing."
"21463910","21465050"," Medei, thanks for subscribing. "
"21465550","21467670"," Warren, Dina, Mike Guilford."
"21467790","21468670"," Thanks for tipping, brother."
"21468830","21469830"," Thanks for supporting the channel. "
"21470370","21475210"," Okay, so every single morning we have a, we start the day before the cash market open."
"21475770","21477590"," We do a daily brief every single morning."
"21477990","21483070"," We talk about how we layer our due diligence, how we layer, how we trade through the day, right?"
"21483070","21484310"," We do traditional charting. "
"21484650","21486610"," We look at volatility levels, gamma levels."
"21486810","21491710"," We look at the market profile, then we look at spot gamma stuff, right?"
"21492430","21497050"," And then we tile this stuff in to market sentiment, trader sentiment."
"21497670","21505630"," And we trade live with book map every day, trying to find out real time what the real levels are"
"21505630","21510250"," in the market and how we can trade this up and down as the market moves right now. "
"21510250","21516130"," Because we know that we can't take any any kind of real risk on without protection in all moments,"
"21516130","21516410"," right?"
"21516690","21521170"," Whether you're a bull bear, doesn't matter, this market can trade in any direction at any time."
"21521650","21523970"," As witness to this would be Facebook, right?"
"21524390","21525990"," Facebook looked like it was recovering yesterday."
"21526230","21526970"," You go long in calls. "
"21527590","21529010"," Can you hold those calls into the bell?"
"21529490","21531250"," No, you can't, right?"
"21531870","21535770"," It traded all the way back this morning and took away all that money, right?"
"21536190","21537490"," That's kind of like thank you for playing."
"21537490","21541890"," You're basically trading to a number and not a day or a time."
"21542470","21545070"," And maybe I guess you're just trading the days right now. "
"21545530","21549310"," Not the best way to be investing in this market and trading this market, but that's what we're"
"21549310","21551910"," presented with and we're adapting to that."
"21552170","21554810"," You can witness this right now in social media, right?"
"21555110","21562070"," You can see long time traders that have built big followings that are not making it right now."
"21562190","21563590"," They're struggling out there right now. "
"21564430","21568950"," There's no fault to them for this, but if you're going to survive in this market and not be"
"21568950","21572450"," straight cash or investing somewhere else, this market is very dangerous."
"21572450","21573370"," So we can see it."
"21573730","21579290"," We can see it all over social media, but the market is dangerous that bulls and bears are getting"
"21579290","21580950"," wrecked in this market. "
"21581230","21584250"," Right now, this is a trader's market, hands down."
"21585850","21589090"," QQQ's calls coming in February 16, 357c."
"21589590","21592110"," I don't like any of these 216 calls into the bell. "
"21592110","21593390"," You can trade these."
"21593530","21594250"," They're very dangerous."
"21594970","21600010"," If you were going to take a long or a short here, the likely thing to take would be something"
"21600010","21601230"," for Friday at this point. "
"21605480","21606300"," Right on, right on."
"21607380","21612880"," I don't like smaller traders starting out cash counter margin going to be all cash right now."
"21612940","21613360"," No margin. "

"22805050","22807990"," It's not that they don't, you know, it's not that you don't hit the target that you want. "
"22808250","22814570"," It's that the interest kicks off and then if you're not trading, you need news like major news, not"
"22814570","22815850"," just a ripping bar."
"22815850","22817910"," That's one thing a lot of people don't get."
"22818030","22818430"," It's not everybody. "
"22818650","22822650"," I know something about a lot of you guys get this, but some of you guys haven't traded a lot"
"22822650","22830530"," of a lot of earnings reports with just calls or puts."
"22832430","22835030"," There's all kinds of roadblocks there."
"22835430","22842010"," You need that interest to not only, not only trade outside of the implied move, but then you need"
"22842010","22847870"," more interest for something that's unknown right on the bell of the following day. "
"22848570","22855970"," Something like a stock split, something like everybody's getting diamonds, we renounced a new car,"
"22857450","22863010"," we're making this, you know, combining companies, something that's just not priced in."
"22865670","22867250"," It has to be, it has to be something big."
"22868090","22869530"," Otherwise you take your money and run. "
"22870350","22873390"," Plus there's usually there's those sellers are always there."
"22876790","22879310"," Just be careful of that as we get into close."
"22879870","22881190"," We should do a video on that too. "
"22881310","22886170"," We should do a video on how to actually trade earnings reports."
"22887070","22890750"," Because it actually goes back to their current earnings report too."
"22891010","22892930"," It's like all these earnings reports here that are misses. "
"22893630","22899130"," You can trade those as well down on the down move into their next earnings report."
"22899370","22902790"," Anyone with good earnings with good guidance, you can trade them up at a certain point once the"

"22919350","22923890"," Still looking to get a buy into the close for trade higher tomorrow."
"22929640","22932100"," And let's say you were going to just buy calls or I can't buy calls. "
"22932940","22935620"," I'm going to buy some outside the money calls for that trade."
"22936200","22936600"," Always spreads."
"22938020","22938680"," Always spreads. "
"22941620","22943420"," Because those will prints regardless of the interest."
"22952780","22954600"," Yeah, the play was the whole hog in Envia."
"22956870","22962790"," Exhale puts February 18, 68 p, $49,000, February 18, 68 p."

"22985850","22987250"," I want cheap calls for Friday."
"22988210","22989970"," I mean, I'm cheap calls for Friday."
"22993210","22994330"," I'm not holding them into Friday. "
"22995410","23000030"," I'm just going to hold them long enough that I can sell them and there's some other sucker on"
"23000030","23000230"," Thursday."

"23017850","23018510"," Good point, Joe."
"23023310","23025890"," Pooten will attack tonight, assuming I long the close. "
"23027830","23029670"," Wouldn't that just be the shit, huh?"
"23030590","23032050"," Wouldn't that just be the shit?"
"23034740","23036680"," That would just be the shit, right?"
"23037420","23038180"," Everybody's pumped."
"23038820","23040400"," Everybody's like, yeah, we're going up."
"23041700","23042720"," And then tomorrow. "
"23049850","23051710"," Then tomorrow we get an invasion."
"23058070","23059310"," That's the way they're getting, right?"
"23064750","23070570"," Jenny Marcus, Jenny Marcus making a good point that we're getting close to Friday's high of 3180 on"
"23070570","23070970"," Amazon."
"23084340","23086300"," He's pointing out that we want to go to 450. "
"23096580","23099000"," We'll see if we can't get it done in the cash market."
"23099000","23104540"," They would do it into the overnight and then we'd trade down from there."
"23105080","23107380"," That would be the only way we get to 450. "
"23108060","23111540"," If we get to 450, right, it has to be done right now."
"23111800","23112960"," We're not seeing in calls."
"23113580","23119040"," So you'd have to expect it to happen in the overnight and then we wouldn't trade me higher. "
"23119700","23122540"," You'd be like boom, sell the rip on the opening bell tomorrow."
"23122880","23125440"," Unless you saw a wave of calls after the bell today, possibly."
"23126220","23131860"," If there is a sell the news event on NVIDIA, that could impact markets as well, right?"
"23138700","23147360"," I'm trying to look to see if anybody's talking about shorting the market into the bell today. "
"23160920","23162320"," Yeah, I think you're going to get a squeeze."
"23162600","23168960"," I think if you're going to trade, if you're going to trade, let me put this way."
"23169060","23173220"," If you're going to trade into Friday, just get some dude seriously. "
"23173900","23179440"," If you want to trade into Friday, if you're going to take along, then just put some nice sweet-ass"

"23188920","23190300"," I guarantee we're trading down."
"23191560","23192400"," There ain't no way."
"23192400","23194420"," Just the vol, just paste them. "
"23194520","23194980"," You know what you could do?"
"23195080","23200740"," You could pair trade it with some, not I don't know if you could do VIX calls dated out that"
"23200740","23201040"," far."
"23202040","23209380"," But trust me, by the time we get to March 18th, the bears are going to be on fire, like"
"23209380","23210220"," straight fire."
"23210580","23213480"," Forget Russia, the bears are going to be on fire. "
"23214200","23217480"," The shit being thrown in the walls, it's going to just be a mess."
"23218280","23221340"," There's going to be a shit show leading into March 18th."
"23222040","23222560"," Guaranteed. "
"23233710","23236770"," Yeah, it takes a bit of a nice Christian, Putin spreads, maybe."
"23238970","23242990"," Trust me, 450, make it like 450, 453p."
"23243670","23245130"," I guarantee they print. "
"23246410","23247190"," I'm not guaranteeing them."
"23247250","23251570"," I'm going to give you like a hundred, like a 99% chance of those bad boys print, heading into"
"23251570","23252430"," March 18th."
"23253210","23254370"," That shit's almost guaranteed. "
"23256130","23257530"," You want to guarantee trade?"
"23258130","23258590"," That's the one."
"23263250","23264210"," That is the trade."
"23265710","23267290"," You can't say that it isn't. "
"23268070","23269950"," You can take no trades right now."
"23270630","23273510"," You can take in the money put spread for March 18th."
"23274650","23275770"," That shit's coming down. "
"23276330","23278810"," There ain't no market maker saving that shit."
"23283770","23287530"," Ooh, Gerald's pointing out that QE supposedly ends March 9th."
"23288510","23289270"," Yeah, it doesn't matter. "
"23289390","23291290"," It doesn't matter what the news is, what the rumors are."
"23296160","23297360"," That's TT Wood."
"23297800","23298060"," Yeah, brother. "
"23299260","23300760"," You're welcome with a financial advice."
"23301500","23302720"," That's a guaranteed trade."
"23302920","23303740"," I guarantee that one. "
"23305360","23306760"," Yeah, I'll put up shop for you."
"23308020","23310440"," I can guarantee that we're not trading above 450."
"23311080","23314380"," At some point heading to March 18th. "
"23315340","23315820"," Guaranteed."
"23317200","23318500"," I'll guarantee that trade."
"23320120","23320600"," Sorry. "
"23322940","23325840"," I'm a bull, but the shit will be flung."
"23326040","23327320"," It'll be like, you ever watch that?"
"23327420","23331760"," There's a comedy where a guy goes to like Mars or something and he paints and uses all the food"
"23331760","23332580"," to paint on the ceiling."
"23332580","23333900"," It's like an old school Disney movie. "
"23334900","23338300"," And he like, he gets, he ends up being awake while everybody's asleep."
"23342070","23344570"," And the shit's going to be smeared across the walls."
"23345910","23347850"," There are hedge funds right now, right?"
"23348050","23351070"," That I have like a boiler room full of 23 year olds. "
"23351990","23357250"," And they're like, okay, we need to do a shit smear campaign leading up to March 18th."
"23358110","23360850"," And they're going to fucking throw it across the fucking room."
"23361490","23364650"," They'll be running that dump scheme shit at any moment. "
"23365970","23367710"," You think the Russian news is bad?"
"23368450","23370270"," Wait until you see the March 18th news."
"23372250","23374270"," Even if it's not true, it doesn't even have to be true."
"23379540","23380020"," Unsure. "
"23380840","23381740"," Yeah, Rocket Man."
"23382820","23383820"," Quantum Leap knows that movie."
"23384640","23385200"," Rocket Man. "
"23385480","23387920"," He's like, he gets woken up from deep sleep or something."
"23389580","23390600"," You have boiler room."
"23390840","23391580"," It's like Rocket Man. "
"23391700","23392800"," He like, he gets woken up from sleep."
"23393000","23394320"," He ends up like taking tube food."
"23394860","23396800"," And he paints like a Michelangelo in the ceiling. "
"23397380","23401780"," And by the time the, by the time the, the, the trip is over, all the food is gone."
"23402340","23404420"," And he's dressed in like a diaper or some shit."
"23406620","23409880"," Spy calls February 16th, 448C. "
"23410960","23413840"," Spy calls February 16th, 447C."
"23414580","23416400"," They're going to park it right into the bell here."
"23422920","23426060"," Yeah, I'm going to pick up some, uh, there's some spy puts. "
"23427340","23430180"," February 16th, 447P for $48,000."
"23430760","23432160"," Let's say they're going to park it into the bell."
"23433060","23437480"," What I'm going to do first is I'm going to wait for the reactions after the bell. "
"23439720","23445160"," Sometimes on this channel, we will, uh, we'll wait for the, for the reactions after the bell."
"23445380","23449040"," If there's a quick dip from panic, you'll see a quick dip in the market."
"23449040","23450740"," You can scoop up some calls real cheap. "
"23452800","23457580"," You know, the apprehension between, uh, when the reports come in and then we'll, we get to see,"
"23457780","23457920"," right?"
"23458400","23459400"," Hey, these reports good."
"23459500","23460340"," These reports bad."
"23461140","23466180"," And it gives us 15 minutes to decide if we're going to long the market into tomorrow. "
"23466720","23471240"," We'll know in the first 15 minutes if we can long this market into tomorrow."
"23471640","23476120"," That's one of the benefits of trading the spy or the cues, as you can trade them after the bell"
"23476120","23478000"," when the reports start to come in."
"23479240","23484280"," If you start seeing big red bell bars come down on, on some of these, uh, trades, right?"
"23486520","23491440"," Let's say NVIDIA starts red barring it down and doesn't recover. "
"23492020","23493160"," Cisco red bars it down."
"23494620","23495860"," Fastly red red bars it down."
"23496140","23501420"," Not enough that they matter as much, but if you're seeing big red giant bars, you can usually"
"23501420","23504960"," decide then if you want to get some calls into the open tomorrow. "
"23505360","23507820"," We know that Walmart's traded down heavy and huge."
"23509440","23511240"," They should have a nice rip tomorrow."
"23513340","23516460"," So we'll know after the bell if we should take a long or not. "
"23520080","23521240"," Harlan Williams, baby."
"23522460","23523580"," He was funny as fuck."
"23523760","23528080"," I don't know what happened to him, but when he was when he was a comedian, kind of lost the"
"23528080","23528800"," time that movie. "
"23530040","23533800"," I'm not a pot smoker, but if you are a pot smoker, probably worth watching that one."
"23534140","23535300"," And I think it's a Disney film."
"23535660","23537600"," I think there was like a whole story behind it too. "
"23537680","23541600"," Like they had to cut a bunch of it out because it was a little bit more racy than it"
"23541600","23541800"," was."
"23542000","23543860"," There was a lot of adult content in that movie."
"23545460","23546040"," Thanks, Josh. "
"23559220","23559580"," Yeah."
"23562280","23563120"," Yeah, and that butterfly."
"23564560","23565640"," Will I be long in the clothes?"
"23566020","23566560"," Yes, I will. "
"23566800","23567160"," More than likely."
"23567440","23567800"," Well, no."
"23568060","23568800"," So that's the deal, right?"
"23568960","23569640"," We wait for three. "
"23570080","23570980"," We've got 15 minutes left."
"23571180","23575240"," We're going to wait for four p.m. Matter of fact, I'm going to take a break right here between"
"23575240","23576340"," now and 358."
"23577760","23579100"," Yeah, I'm going to leave the stream up. "
"23579320","23580240"," People talk on the chat."
"23580420","23581040"," Nobody goes away."
"23581100","23581880"," I've got a partner here. "
"23581880","23583020"," His name is Charlie."
"23583360","23585180"," He will talk during the stream."
"23586540","23592340"," And I'm going to just take a quick 15 minute break and get ready for the clothes. "
"23592680","23594500"," I'm not going from where we are right now."
"23595420","23595960"," I'm not."
"23596140","23597720"," There might be short covering into the clothes. "
"23597800","23599560"," There might be a trade in that between now and clothes."
"23600140","23604160"," You might see a quick rip up like a dip down quick rip up."
"23604440","23605900"," Just short covering operation. "
"23606480","23607580"," Don't get caught in that."
"23607720","23610660"," If you want to trade that long, you get in it and you get out of it."
"23610660","23612020"," You don't hold it into the bell. "
"23612740","23613720"," Normally, that's my rules."
"23613920","23614620"," I'm like, I have rules, right?"
"23614760","23615400"," People say, don't have rules."
"23615600","23616120"," I have fucking rules. "
"23617120","23620320"," Like if we do a short cover, I trade that short cover and then I'm out."
"23620920","23623020"," And then I look for a cheaper price after the bell."
"23623180","23624800"," I'm going to long or short the next day. "
"23626260","23627220"," And then we have the special."
"23627460","23628240"," It's beautiful right now."
"23628280","23629020"," I've got earnings reports. "
"23629960","23636500"," You get to watch if NVIDIA is a good report before you make a trade."
"23637400","23641600"," And if NVIDIA is going to shit report or if they know there's a shit report, you know that you"
"23641600","23644140"," don't have to long the cues or the spy and it's tomorrow."
"23646240","23652880"," And we saw, as a matter of fact, one of our best trades recently, Microsoft, red bars, the depths"
"23652880","23653340"," of hell. "
"23654480","23656160"," Figured out that they had a better report."
"23656420","23658020"," Well, Fargo's credit ratings."
"23658280","23661180"," They're also changing the outlook to stable from negative. "
"23662600","23664400"," Missy Franklin Charlie at Moody's."
"23665240","23666500"," Well, it's Fargo with a pump."
"23668650","23672570"," So you know, if there's any like panic selling from NVIDIA into the belly, don't have to worry"
"23672570","23673050"," about that. "
"23673350","23679150"," As soon as NVIDIA reports, like the Microsoft trade went from red bars to hell, first five minutes"
"23679150","23682570"," of the trade, all of a sudden it came out that the guidance was fucking baller."
"23683050","23687910"," We bought calls after the bell on the cues and the spy."
"23688750","23692570"," And once it came back up by morning, it didn't matter. "

"23697190","23697930"," the Ukraine border."
"23698710","23700810"," That goes other Western officials today."
"23702850","23707110"," It didn't matter at that point if the market opened flat or even slightly red. "
"23707410","23712870"," We ended up printing calls regardless because of the huge dip that took place in the after hours."
"23713990","23722210"," It was a prime place, prime time with NVIDIA reporting to possibly take a trade long or short after"
"23722210","23722570"," the bell."

"23772600","23773840"," Never thought I'd be doing this."

"23778360","23778820"," like this?"
"23779360","23781680"," It's bizarre, totally bizarre."
"23782840","23784380"," And was not expecting this at all. "
"23789250","23791770"," A little resistance above here on the spy."
"23792610","23794290"," A little bit of secret sellers here above."
"23795710","23797650"," I see them right up here at 4.48. 10. "
"23800090","23801930"," I see if we can get a squeeze out of this or not."
"23805750","23807350"," A little bit of an indecision candle here."

"23898580","23900120"," I'm like, I just want to buy zero dates right now."
"23901020","23902460"," I'm like a pure gambler sometimes. "
"23902860","23904020"," They're like, clear this out."
"23904180","23904940"," I'm not going to buy them."
"23904940","23906760"," I'm not going to do it. "
"23907380","23909400"," I'm like, I want to buy calls so bad."

"23948280","23952400"," Monster buyers down below at 720."
"23953080","23955900"," Nice support on shop for NVIDIA into the close."
"23961900","23963100"," I got a shit ton of rules. "
"23963620","23968280"," Like, it's weird because the rules even involve market conditions."
"23968280","23969640"," You know, it is a time and market."
"23969840","23974620"," That's one thing that people won't tell you is that it's okay to an extent to lose money. "
"23976260","23980140"," Believe it or not, like the more money that you lose, you don't have to lose, like, you get"
"23980140","23980660"," different levels."
"23980660","23981340"," It's really weird."
"23983560","23985140"," Like, start off by paper trading. "
"23986100","23988760"," Always encourage paper trading, but it's different than real trading."
"23989340","23990140"," It's not the same."
"23991720","23995280"," And then you'll see like, you'll get different levels. "
"23995280","23997060"," Like, you'll be like, oh, this sucks."
"23997240","23998280"," I always lost a thousand bucks."
"23998800","24000020"," Then I lost $5,000. "
"24000780","24005000"," And then you lose like $10,000 and $20,000 and $100,000."
"24006120","24007340"," And a couple hundred thousand dollars."
"24007580","24009000"," And you'll increase your risk. "
"24009320","24013100"," You'll get more comfortable with your trades, but also along the way."
"24013740","24016140"," The other thing that you gain is you get market experience."
"24016440","24019980"," So all the teaching you can do in the world, all this stuff, right?"
"24021620","24022580"," And so what do you do?"
"24022720","24024660"," You trade with small amounts of money to start out. "
"24026080","24033200"," More Nvidia calls, February 18th, 270C, $500,000, Nvidia calls, February 18th, 270C, $4,000 to $48 "

"24034320","24035860"," The key is to lose money."
"24036380","24037220"," No one tells you that. "
"24037360","24038840"," Everyone wants to tell you you're going to always going to win."
"24039300","24042220"," It's better when you lose money than you know what losing means."
"24043080","24046480"," You know the pain of losing money and the biggest lessons that you're going to learn, the rules"
"24046480","24049180"," that you're going to make for yourself is, I'm never doing that again. "
"24049880","24051760"," Because I lost money doing that in the past, right?"
"24051900","24052200"," And it hurts."
"24053200","24057100"," Nvidia, 218, 270C, $4,000 and $74,000."
"24058140","24062960"," And so the real way you become a better trader when they say only 10% make it, some people"
"24062960","24063720"," come and they go, right?"
"24063880","24066780"," A lot of the coming going is, is it's not meant for them. "
"24066840","24067940"," It's not the right job for them."
"24068720","24071540"," But if you keep at it and you're like, hey, I'm just going to keep learning, keep learning."
"24071840","24074220"," I'm going to keep taking my licks, keep making mistakes. "
"24075640","24078740"," That mark time in market, it means more than anything."
"24079280","24081820"," You have time in market, time in market."
"24082200","24086140"," Even with losses, you have to go back to your job, make your money save 100 bucks a week, 200"
"24086140","24089640"," bucks a week, whatever it is, to keep learning how to trade. "
"24090900","24092260"," And you just stick with it, right?"
"24093320","24095260"," I'm telling you, it makes a difference."
"24097640","24104040"," Facebook, February 18th, to Facebook, February 18th, $2,17.5 C for around $74,000."
"24104840","24108400"," Nvidia, February 18th, 270C, $379,000. "
"24110860","24114300"," But there's a, you know, there's a, time in market is key."
"24116180","24117320"," Time in market is key."
"24120740","24124780"," And I'll tell you something else, if you guys survive this market, if you survive this year in the"
"24124780","24127560"," market, you're going to become a better trader. "
"24127900","24133280"," The only problem that you could have, that I could see down the road, the only problem that I had"
"24133280","24136600"," was adjust, I had a hard time adjusting to 2020."
"24136600","24139620"," I had a real hard time going long."
"24140620","24142300"," I did, but it was not easy. "
"24143400","24153280"," For it, VXX puts February 18th, 22P, $425,000, Nvidia calls, crazy, crazy, foam mobile, stepping"
"24153280","24154940"," in now, made tons of money."

"24292940","24295940"," If we see NVIDIA Red Bar, Dan will know."
"24297520","24301060"," I doubt that you see NVIDIA stay stable after the bell. "
"24313440","24316280"," Remember, the banks aren't buying calls for a carpenter grand."

"24463870","24466730"," I would assume that's a large equity stake being pumped up into the bell. "
"24467090","24467850"," Not real bulls."
"24469310","24474270"," Apple 225, 177.5, C for $31,000 on the bell."

"24715960","24717980"," See this big red bar above here."
"24719040","24721800"," Banks taking profit regardless of what earnings report."
"24729230","24731490"," USO continuing to sell off after the bell. "
"24733050","24734890"," Anybody with those puts on?"
"24735190","24737170"," We saw some puts earlier in XLE."
"24737170","24739890"," We saw them on a couple other tickers, right?"
"24740170","24740530"," XLE."
"24742970","24745390"," Where else do we see some puts on energy earlier?"
"24748060","24752260"," XLE puts, oxy puts, oil still selling off after the bell. "
"24753680","24755800"," Spies still continuing to sell off after the bell."
"24755980","24760660"," It's $4.03. Not seeing any other puts after the bell right now."
"24760680","24762400"," It's an interesting trade on the SQ trade. "
"24762980","24767480"," Wondering why SQ someone slipped in a trade for $500,000 on SQ in tomorrow."
"24771020","24772680"," Spy trading back down to that."
"24773240","24778240"," If you look at the spy, we know that there's a support level. "
"24778540","24780560"," It's trading outside of its trading channel right now."
"24781120","24782760"," It's trading back to the upper range."
"24784160","24791200"," Right down 446.04. Spine out on 39 cents, 40 cents. "
"24793280","24797260"," Those calls are now down to $1.20. Talk about a discount on calls, right?"
"24798180","24805000"," In reality, normally, if this wasn't the news we had in FMC minutes, I'd be looking for those 450"
"24805000","24807380"," C's to be down around 60 cents."
"24808340","24815280"," So if I was going to trade a three day trade on the spy, four strikes away, roughly about 60"
"24815280","24815680"," cents."
"24815840","24816520"," I want to pay for those. "
"24817200","24822680"," So if you were going to pip by those, let's say you had $100, you're like, I'm going to buy,"
"24822680","24828500"," I guess $100 doesn't work on these, but that's you're going to buy some spy 450s for Friday."
"24828800","24832140"," Normally, you would say, well, I'm not going to go in with my 100."
"24832140","24834940"," I'm going to buy like $10 worth, $50 worth. "
"24835720","24840740"," And I'm going to average down in case those 450s get drained to like 60 cents."
"24841400","24842800"," You don't want to get stuck back holding."
"24842940","24850080"," It's common practice of market makers to start discounting Friday calls between now and Friday. "
"24850340","24851520"," But we've got OpEx on Friday."
"24852080","24859340"," Normally, an OpEx on Friday will have a pretty sideways day, not always, but like this like monthly"
"24859340","24860820"," OpEx, like a sideways day."
"24861920","24867200"," And if we've been down in the month, we'll use sometimes, volatility was known for this, right?"
"24867880","24872460"," That the third, if we're down, we'll have a Thursday that rips high, like one, two percent day. "
"24876630","24879250"," The calls are starting to regain some value currently."
"24879570","24880570"," Spy is finding a bottom."
"24888150","24890310"," See if I can squeeze in some buys. "
"24894990","24902130"," See if I can snag them just lower maybe than $1.20. Put an order in for $1.19. Oh,"
"24902290","24902850"," there we go."
"24903790","24904070"," Okay."
"24905970","24908130"," See if I can buy some calls here. "
"24911860","24914240"," After the bell, we've got calls on Spy."
"24915200","24921240"," 463 C, March 18, $500,000 at 405 pm."
"24926850","24927770"," Just a heads up. "
"24927910","24933090"," There are calls after the bell on the spy."
"24935620","24944960"," For March 18, we've got to fill on"
"24944960","24955040"," 450 C's for $1.20 for Friday expiry, February"
"24955040","24957680"," 18, $4.50 C."
"24959380","24960740"," We'll see how those play out."
"24964350","24968290"," And we'll stick around for the NVIDIA earnings report and see what happens. "
"24968630","24970130"," So I'm in the trade for tomorrow."
"24970230","24971470"," I think we gap up."
"24972890","24974950"," I think we attempt to gap up in the overnight. "
"24975210","24981270"," If we don't gap up, I find it hard to believe that we trade up to $4.50 tomorrow or"
"24981270","24981670"," Friday."
"24982110","24986370"," Unless we see a wave of call action come in, I think it's going to be difficult to get us"
"24986370","24988370"," up and above and through this volatility trigger."
"24989450","24993670"," We need to bypass the volatility trigger and trap some shorts. "
"24994750","25001190"," If we can't do that, then we're going to go down to be aware of that."
"25003760","25005780"," FSLY is down 25%."
"25006340","25007340"," Yeah, call wall expansion. "
"25007660","25007760"," Okay."
"25008000","25013620"," So all the calls in the market, we saw some calls come in today for March at higher strikes for"
"25013620","25015220"," 60s and for 70s."
"25016780","25023160"," There is a call wall in the market right now at roughly $4.50. That is the roof, the ceiling"
"25023160","25023840"," that we can go. "
"25024440","25034340"," Now there's a large concentration there of calls, but not as large as the 425Ps that are out"
"25034340","25034520"," there."
"25034620","25040900"," There's a bunch of puts down at $4.25. And the market makers don't want to print them."
"25042040","25046700"," They don't want to be paying money out to someone that bought calls a month ago or three months"
"25046700","25047000"," ago. "
"25047940","25049340"," Unless there's follow through."
"25049580","25051020"," You need new bag holders, basically."
"25051760","25056160"," You could always bag holders down at $4.25, right?"
"25056260","25056880"," I bought calls. "
"25057280","25060160"," I want them to print on February 18th."
"25060260","25062340"," I'm holding $4.25Ps. I want them to print."
"25063320","25066780"," And so I need someone else to buy those calls for me. "
"25066960","25071600"," So I need a reason and the market makers and dealers need a reason and they're hedging against"
"25071600","25071920"," this."
"25072380","25077180"," So as soon as those hedges roll off, it should also make the market spring higher."
"25077760","25079880"," Let's say on Monday, not Monday, but Tuesday. "
"25080880","25086340"," If those calls don't, but those puts don't print, you're going to see a, you should see a spring"
"25086340","25089020"," up, a Vanna rally into Tuesday, let's say."
"25089640","25091660"," Now the Vanna rally could take place tomorrow."
"25092180","25096360"," If bears don't think that it's going to print, they'll cut those loose at some point. "
"25097180","25099840"," And it should turn into some form of a Vanna rally."
"25099840","25104100"," Not like when we were in a bull market, you're not going to see three days of us up to"
"25104100","25105700"," 500 or some stupid like that."
"25106400","25110060"," But you will see the hedging come off from the dealers. "
"25112240","25117200"," And unless bears step in and say, I want those to print, right?"
"25117360","25121640"," If bears say we're going to doom and gloom, and they start buying a bunch of puts down at $4 "
"25121640","25126300",".25, what they'll do is they'll print them for the original bup buyers, those cash out, take their"
"25126300","25126780"," money and run."
"25126780","25129880"," And then the bag holders will wind up being the new round of bears."
"25130340","25135040"," This happens for bears and bulls all the time, both sides of that trade. "
"25135420","25141960"," Well, we should go into this more complex ways of discussing this, but for like a dumb trader,"
"25142500","25143780"," that's all you need to know."
"25144840","25146160"," So tomorrow, right?"
"25146420","25147220"," Where do they want to keep it?"
"25147680","25148880"," Probably not tomorrow."
"25149280","25150200"," Friday, probably want to keep it lower. "
"25150840","25154920"," Probably don't want to pay the $4.50. They probably don't want to pay the $4.25. So the park"
"25154920","25159520"," are right in the middle, for the least amount of strikes are for the attempt to, unless bears are"
"25159520","25163880"," bull step in to not print those tickets for people."
"25164580","25168120"," So the more pain that they give to these bears down there, the better off they are."
"25168440","25172920"," They could care less about printing calls higher, as long as they don't print those puts lower on"
"25172920","25173180"," Friday. "
"25176090","25181070"," That's kind of a really dumb down redneck version of explaining this."
"25185290","25187690"," It's kind of a dumb down version in reality."
"25188850","25192810"," There's a fair chance you'll see a run tomorrow, and then a sideways movement on Friday. "
"25193350","25195790"," That's probably like a 40% chance."
"25196190","25199130"," You probably have a 50% chance of us trading sideways."
"25200130","25201050"," No, that's 40%. "
"25201050","25204510"," I'll give it another 40% chance that we trade sideways into Friday."
"25205810","25210790"," And then I'd give it a 20% chance or less that we would trade down into four 20s."
"25211090","25213850"," It would have to be news like, well, war would do it. "
"25215190","25220410"," Maybe just one pissed off hedge fund that's like bucket and going balls deep and $10 billion in"
"25220410","25220610"," puts."
"25221310","25225710"," I don't know if that would happen, but I guess you'd need something like that."
"25226150","25230030"," It's for 11, four minutes left on the cash market on the indexes. "
"25231250","25231850"," I'm dumb."
"25232030","25233450"," I try to trade dumb, believe it or not."
"25234210","25236470"," I started making more money when I got dumb as a trader. "
"25237110","25242710"," The smarter the smarter trader I became, the more smart I became, the more research I did."
"25243850","25249670"," The worst fucking trades I met got took because I would go down the rabbit hole and my brain would"
"25249670","25251090"," keep me all fucked up in the head."
"25251970","25253690"," And you know what's disgusting about this market?"
"25255050","25259550"," You have like text leaks and email leaks and you have leaks and banks and hedge funds. "
"25260270","25261430"," You know what the leak always is?"
"25261870","25264850"," The leak is never like we had this complex trade on."
"25265470","25273290"," The leak is always like the CEO from one company and the CEO of another company going, yeah, don't"
"25273290","25273790"," worry about it."
"25273870","25276350"," We just bought fucking zero day puts on this ticker. "
"25277550","25280790"," Or yeah, we went balls deep on zero day puts on the market."
"25281390","25285310"," And then of course, the news is like, oh, it's the retail traders that are short."
"25286050","25289930"," It's like, I'm not saying it's like 3.3 billion in revenue. "
"25289930","25292710"," It does 4.8 billion consensus topics or delta."
"25293990","25296510"," You know, it's not retail traders doing this shit."
"25297070","25298710"," It's people with money doing this shit. "
"25299470","25301630"," So when they say that stupid shit to you, it's not real."
"25302410","25303210"," Fucking fake."
"25304890","25308350"," It's like some fat old guy and his buddy that have power. "
"25309170","25313070"," So the closer you get to being a dumb trader, the better you can trade with those guys."
"25319470","25320030"," We do."
"25320390","25321570"," I still haven't done that challenge. "
"25323270","25326690"," Is if it's nothing disgusting, it's very free from free market."
"25327170","25328830"," You guys think everybody's rocket set."
"25329170","25330510"," You know, it's the funniest part of talking about this. "
"25330630","25332670"," I'm like, the funniest part of what the market is."
"25332810","25336770"," When you guys are watching and following guys out there using big words and complex thoughts,"
"25337290","25337830"," right?"
"25338110","25343190"," Most of the time the person behind that account is someone trying to sell something or someone"
"25343190","25345310"," trying to get an internship."
"25346910","25350390"," They're like, you know, I've got a finance degree and I need to get hired. "
"25350770","25351610"," So I need to make inroads."
"25351850","25352850"," I need to network."
"25353050","25353370"," How are you networking?"
"25353370","25354690"," I'm networking on Twitter. "
"25355930","25360150"," You know, what they're shot calling and they're making all these claims and bolsters on Twitter."
"25360950","25364910"," And in reality, these guys, you know, they either have a side hustle or not that that's a bad thing"
"25364910","25367750"," just that you guys think that it's like a trader."
"25368130","25368990"," And it's not a fucking trader. "
"25369710","25371790"," Fucking traders don't give a flying fuck."
"25373370","25375850"," Flying fuck about what economists say."
"25376490","25377590"," What finance guys say. "
"25377770","25382230"," No one gives a fucking fuck, but you know, like I don't know how to explain that better."
"25383450","25384270"," Dumber you are."
"25384590","25385190"," The better you are. "
"25385490","25386870"," Off you are as an investor and a trader."
"25388150","25388910"," Hands down."
"25389650","25390790"," Because then you can look at C."
"25391490","25394190"," You can actually look at what accumulation is in a company. "
"25394730","25397070"," You can look at what distribution is in a company."
"25397630","25401110"," You can look at how they sell down to take profit on a company."
"25401930","25404210"," You can take trades when instead of being scared. "
"25404610","25406970"," You take trades being not scared anymore."
"25407230","25408810"," You're like, I know exactly what's going on."
"25417160","25417920"," It's disgusting. "
"25418940","25420540"," That's how you trade Tesla, right?"
"25421780","25423200"," So like that's the other thing."
"25423320","25423800"," Let's talk about Tesla."
"25424140","25428980"," Like I'm a Tesla bull, but you got a Tesla bull that's been holding stock for 20 years. "
"25429580","25432460"," He's going to tell you to buy, right?"
"25432720","25433600"," He's going to sell puts."
"25433660","25436960"," He's going to sell calls when he's supposed to or she."
"25438140","25440380"," But they're never going to tell you to sell. "
"25440840","25443400"," They're going to do it in the background, but they're not going to tell you that."
"25443720","25448220"," They always want the stock to go up, right?"
"25448220","25449800"," But in the background, they'll be selling puts."
"25450040","25450680"," They'll be selling calls. "
"25452000","25455500"," Then a new trader is just trying to break in to Tesla."
"25455760","25457140"," Let's say, hey, I'm a real Tesla bull."
"25457440","25462240"," I'm going down the rabbit hole, and yet you get these conflicting messages about when you should"
"25462240","25463100"," actually buy Tesla. "
"25463640","25465540"," And there are right times to buy Tesla."
"25466040","25467960"," Believe it or not, there's a right time to buy Tesla."
"25468460","25471420"," There's a right time to sell Tesla and rebuy Tesla. "
"25472240","25475460"," And any other stock you can think of out there, right?"
"25475460","25478340"," And a lot of these old traders and old investors know this."
"25479280","25483580"," Matter of fact, I give a lot of respect right now, believe it or not, to meet Kevin for saying"
"25483580","25484180"," that publicly."
"25484900","25489140"," Because he probably burned down a bunch of money that he makes, like selling shit and selling"
"25489140","25494540"," classes and whatever the fuck it is he sells, endorsements, any of that stuff. "
"25494720","25495340"," He's probably hurt himself."
"25495760","25502320"," And I respect him for that because he's teaching a lesson to investors that a lot of furrers don't"
"25502320","25502500"," teach."
"25503920","25505220"," A lot of them don't. "
"25505680","25507700"," And a lot of them are pissed off at me, Kevin."
"25508300","25512540"," And, you know, because they don't, they just selling shit to you."
"25512960","25518740"," And I know that me, Kevin does that kind of shit, but he's teaching a hard lesson that that"
"25518740","25520340"," investors need to know. "
"25525990","25527910"," Dash up 16% of DPS missed."
"25530670","25531550"," Yeah, exactly."
"25532390","25536070"," I mean, I can't be like Michael Douglas and go look for earnings and company filing cabinets. "
"25536430","25537950"," I bet that shit did happen."
"25539390","25540970"," Yeah, trade what's right in front of you."
"25541050","25544310"," That's a fucking lily Christian, especially right now. "
"25544370","25544650"," It's glaring."
"25545010","25546430"," Like it's super glaring right now."
"25546570","25547090"," Wasn't it glaring?"
"25547450","25549850"," You know, wasn't it glaring, uh, me neither. "
"25550010","25550790"," I have to still have to make Kevin."
"25552670","25554290"," The, uh, you have to keep going."
"25554590","25560210"," You take your fucking knocks, get back in there, and you just keep fucking attacking until it"
"25560210","25562690"," starts to, you'll know what wins and what what doesn't win, Brad. "
"25565510","25573470"," The, uh, yeah, I don't know a lot about him, but I'm very impressed with what he did, because it's"
"25573470","25575590"," important to make that transition and shift right now."
"25577310","25579590"," Because people are going to get fucked up in this market."
"25580070","25583870"," I promise, promise people are going to get fucked up in this market. "
"25585090","25586470"," You saw yesterday, right?"
"25586550","25587490"," You saw Facebook yesterday."
"25588390","25592390"," I mean, how many fucking, you dropped 20 grand in calls yesterday, 50 grand in calls on Facebook,"
"25592570","25593110"," and you hold them overnight?"
"25594050","25595150"," You got fucked today."
"25596230","25596910"," Bent over. "
"25599280","25600140"," That's real money."
"25600640","25602060"," Like, that's somebody's real money."
"25602660","25603300"," That shit hurts. "
"25604200","25607880"," And then you go on to like a Facebook feed, and everybody's like pumped up on Facebook, going to"
"25607880","25608160"," the close."
"25608920","25609800"," Everybody's like long and strong."
"25610120","25610580"," Woo, woo, woo. "
"25611440","25612800"," It's not that you're not long and strong."
"25612980","25617480"," It's that you take your money and run, and you jump back in the next day in this market right"
"25617480","25617740"," now."
"25618260","25621040"," 2020, 2021, you just buy the fucking dip and hold, right?"
"25621620","25621640"," Easy. "
"25622480","25623220"," Easy trading."
"25625690","25628050"," All right, it's 4.18. We're waiting two more minutes."
"25628770","25629690"," See what happens that. "
"25629910","25630570"," See what happens on."
"25631030","25636110"," Let's see what happens on Nvidia after the 420 mark, and then I'm fucking out of here."
"25636530","25637890"," You guys are savages out there. "
"25639350","25640310"," You can be down."
"25640810","25641790"," I've been down, dude."
"25642050","25642830"," I have been down. "
"25643530","25645290"," I have gotten my ass handed to me."
"25646350","25647650"," Ass handed to me."
"25648610","25651270"," Like straight up had my ass handed to me. "
"25652430","25653790"," I've walked away from trading."
"25654390","25656030"," I've walked away for like a month at a time."
"25656030","25659630"," Like I've fucked up so bad that I couldn't even trade. "
"25659990","25661150"," I was like, I just stopped trading."
"25661770","25663310"," I just stopped trading."
"25663970","25664990"," Like mine fucked up. "
"25665190","25666330"," Can't talk to anybody about it."
"25666770","25667790"," Can't explain to people."
"25670050","25670670"," Like devastated. "
"25671570","25672970"," Had this market fucked me up."
"25673490","25674950"," So I get it."
"25678270","25678870"," I get it. "
"25678970","25680110"," Did you trade before 2020?"
"25682670","25683150"," Brutal."
"25684490","25686690"," I started trading when I was talking to somebody last night."
"25686810","25689170"," I started trading right when the death. "
"25690670","25692250"," It was a really weird time."
"25692630","25697170"," It was the death of the final like nail in the coffin of Yahoo finance."
"25697990","25699890"," And we still didn't have social media. "
"25700670","25703150"," It was like the worst time to begin trading."
"25704150","25706890"," Like there was a time when Yahoo was like the place."
"25707450","25708070"," It was like Twitter. "
"25708410","25709350"," It was like Wall Street pets."
"25709590","25712710"," It was like any other like it was it was their version of that."
"25713010","25714450"," But then the in between years. "
"25716270","25721550"," Before all the rut trolls and bots and all the nastiness and the weird like hope Yahoo finance"
"25721550","25722950"," became this really fucking weird place."
"25723390","25727530"," But there was like a bunch of years there like two three years where you couldn't even reach out to"
"25727530","25727810"," people."
"25728450","25729930"," Like there was just nobody to talk to. "
"25730950","25732170"," This is nowhere to go."
"25733950","25736990"," It was nowhere to go to be like, Hey, can I talk to the people about this?"
"25737170","25737970"," It was a ghost town."
"25738570","25739890"," People got cleaned out. "
"25740730","25741990"," Straight up cleaned out."
"25745870","25747270"," Yeah, it's hard to it's brutal."
"25748190","25749790"," Yeah, it's hard to start over again. "
"25749890","25750830"," It's not fucking easy."
"25751470","25753570"," It is not in the mind your brain."
"25755710","25757370"," Oh, somebody took an ALB trade. "
"25761010","25763970"," Yeah, Mary knows about the Yahoo like Yahoo was."
"25764130","25771290"," Nvidia reporting a dollar 32 on the adjusted line beats the 122 estimate 7.64 billion in revenue."
"25771390","25772590"," Also a beat for Nvidia. "
"25774150","25775190"," Remember Victor Delta."
"25777270","25778790"," And video with a beat."
"25784470","25791890"," Guiding next quarter revenue 8.1 billion plus or minus 2% non gap gross margins expected that 65.2"
"25791890","25796170"," to 67% plus or minus 50 basis points. "
"25797990","25806410"," And 8.1 billion compares to a 7.29 billion consensus estimate."
"25806410","25812060"," Oh, yeah, you also have some trades in it."
"25812060","25815340"," INTC AMD and SMH tomorrow off that beat. "
"25820060","25822180"," Oh, no down 5% so that they beat."
"25823580","25825280"," I'm not looking at the ticker right now."
"25825320","25826340"," It looks like Nvidia's got beats. "
"25827380","25828640"," Or does it just take the money and run?"
"25829360","25830000"," We look closer."
"25830260","25830680"," I thought they beat."
"25831000","25831540"," Oh, I'm a little closer. "
"25832300","25832860"," Did I miss that?"
"25835060","25835640"," Hold on here."
"25835860","25837680"," Yeah, but this news is not out in public yet."
"25839780","25840940"," Nobody's got this news yet. "
"25841240","25841720"," There's no trust me."
"25841780","25843140"," This is before anybody else has it."
"25844820","25846200"," Let me take a look here closer. "
"25848910","25849810"," Oh, no, they missed."
"25850050","25850710"," Oh, no, wait a minute."
"25851410","25852110"," Hold on a second. "
"25852210","25852590"," They might have missed."
"25853010","25853850"," I might have got that wrong."
"25856750","25857710"," Hold on here. "
"25860990","25862130"," There wasn't a beat or a miss."
"25866930","25867990"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"25868290","25869670"," I told you we had the news before everybody. "
"25869690","25870190"," You guys crazy."
"25871070","25872670"," You guys don't fucking believe me, do you?"
"25873230","25873990"," Sons of bitches."
"25874530","25875550"," Has it come back up or no?"
"25876070","25876650"," It should go back. "
"25876810","25877710"," It looked like I thought it was a beat."
"25879670","25883590"," Uh, just so you know, you don't really get the news before everybody else."
"25885630","25888490"," Uh, I thought it was a beat. "
"25889050","25889730"," Let me take a look here."
"25890750","25892290"," Or is this just take the money and run?"
"25893810","25894510"," Look at that."
"25894630","25895930"," Look at that wild candle. "
"25898390","25900290"," I think this is a beat from what I heard."
"25901310","25902770"," Look at that trading range."
"25903390","25904890"," 251 to 275. "
"25907010","25908070"," I think it's a beat."
"25909850","25911550"," And the guidance is kick ass."
"25915410","25916150"," Yeah, dude. "
"25916910","25919310"," Dude, guidance is fucking very strong."
"25919310","25920990"," This should be ripping at some point."
"25921730","25923250"," They beat fucking across the board. "
"25924150","25925850"," And their fucking guidance is sick."
"25929280","25930460"," It was a fucking huge beat."
"25931660","25934240"," Getting the news before the fucking plebs get it. "
"25935080","25936900"," Gotta get the algos to kick in."
"25941650","25943630"," It's because nobody else has that news."
"25943910","25947730"," We hear in the news before, uh, the plebs, I think. "
"25948450","25950790"," Unless it's a sell the news moments, possibly."
"25952410","25954450"," Trading down at 251 then up to 275."
"25956330","25957110"," Crazy, too. "
"25957250","25959910"," I've got, uh, well, we talked about it in video before."
"25960070","25961970"," We, we, we, we marked on it."
"25962150","25964470"," We marked before on a previous stream. "
"25964470","25967430"," We marked 249, uh, 98 as support."
"25968010","25970470"," And we marked 274, 41 as the sell."
"25971550","25973030"," I've got it on a chart over here. "
"25973630","25975290"," And then we did this live on stream."
"25976350","25979230"," So almost to the pin by two pennies on the support."
"25980110","25983550"," And above we got it wrong in 274, 741. "
"25983550","25986130"," They actually traded to 275, 98."
"26015910","26019310"," Seven floats and everybody is going to burn those calls and pin the stock."
"26024280","26024660"," Yeah. "
"26024940","26028900"," So we looked at an NVIDIA before prior to to see where real support was."
"26029460","26031160"," It was at 249, 98."
"26031540","26033480"," We had the sell at 274, 41. "
"26034600","26036820"," And it just tagged both at both ends."
"26037040","26039360"," It went a little bit higher on the, on the, on the high side."
"26040800","26042920"," So it looks like, uh, like a fishing, right?"
"26043160","26049680"," Just like in, uh, an equity or an, uh, in, uh, fucking currency. "
"26050260","26052540"," It looks like a fishing expedition to buy the dip."
"26053240","26058600"," Looks like that, like by the dippers went down at 251 and then wrote it up and sold the rip"
"26058600","26060140"," at 275, 98."
"26065150","26066950"," Gangsters, straight gangsters. "
"26069170","26070850"," NVIDIA's guidance is fucking crazy."
"26071190","26071490"," Good too."
"26074660","26084610"," We're talking, what, uh, I mean, the guidance is 10% more, maybe 12% growth,"
"26086650","26087450"," which is insane. "
"26089940","26090240"," Yeah."
"26090440","26090760"," Stop hunting."
"26091000","26094730"," That's what's called stop hunting. "
"26094950","26095590"," It's going to trade higher."
"26095710","26096130"," It's got to."
"26096370","26098250"," I think it does work. "
"26098490","26102270"," Or maybe what's the same, whatever you're saying was, uh, pin it into the open tomorrow."
"26104130","26106430"," This looks like fucking banks just killing it."
"26114960","26116860"," 12% growth next quarter. "
"26117200","26118820"," That's in, that's that next quarter."
"26122750","26128170"," Uh, guides quarter one very strong, expects to announce many new products, applications and"
"26128170","26130050"," partners for NVIDIA computing."
"26130730","26134130"," Dude, this is a gangster fucking, gangster guidance. "
"26145850","26146210"," Damn."
"26147310","26147990"," It's trading lower."
"26148250","26150250"," I'd be pissed right now if I was long into this close. "
"26152830","26153770"," Thank you, the real spad chairman."
"26154490","26154830"," Hey brother."
"26155810","26156550"," Chairs to you. "
"26157590","26158170"," Let me see if I can get a whiskey."
"26158370","26158570"," Hold on."
"26172060","26172800"," Let me see if I can get a whiskey. "
"26173620","26174540"," I don't know if they're going to give me one."
"26176660","26177760"," This is out of bullshit."
"26177940","26179140"," It better trade up into tomorrow. "
"26181180","26182480"," The guidance is beautiful."
"26187760","26188960"," Yeah, it's cruel, man."
"26191300","26192640"," It better be up tomorrow. "
"26195860","26197480"," There's banks in there right now."
"26197920","26198640"," ALB is down 11%."
"26201520","26202500"," This is brutal. "
"26205020","26205420"," Sell the news."
"26206640","26207880"," Makes sense to an extent, right?"
"26207880","26210140"," Oh, no, it doesn't make sense, right?"
"26210300","26212300"," Sold down from 346-36."
"26213180","26213860"," Hell no. "
"26215320","26217500"," This should be trading up in the after hours."
"26218940","26220440"," This looks like a scam operation."
"26225010","26226930"," Maybe there's something in guidance we don't know. "
"26227310","26228190"," Maybe we missed something."
"26228910","26232090"," From what I'm looking at, I'm not seeing anything."
"26232510","26234610"," Oh, maybe you can see these wall of sellers here, right?"
"26235250","26236650"," Huge wall of sellers right here. "
"26237770","26239910"," Profit taking, banks profit taking."
"26242490","26243950"," That's a huge beat."
"26246010","26247570"," Samuel Adams with a beat. "
"26249250","26250570"," Boston Bear Company."
"26251510","26253210"," See what they're doing after the bell."
"26254390","26255650"," Sellin' off, dude. "
"26256510","26257150"," Down to 400."
"26258310","26263510"," The report's 2-4 minus 4-22 versus 264."
"26263510","26266430"," Ooh, the revs are down bad. "
"26267750","26274970"," This goes back to them not being able to sell whatever those clear things that every drink's."
"26275450","26275730"," White claws."
"26276710","26282070"," They fucked up on the white claw, and it's still affecting the stock. "
"26284270","26285310"," Still, damn."
"26287050","26288310"," Trading down to 400."
"26289110","26290830"," I think that was their last dip, right?"
"26291070","26291550"," It was 400. "
"26292430","26293450"," Getting wrecked."
"26295050","26297270"," We're gonna have to look at Samuel Adams tomorrow."
"26301150","26302770"," We're gonna have to take a look at that and see what's up. "
"26303350","26304690"," How far do they trade down?"
"26305870","26307570"," They could take a massive hit."
"26308230","26310870"," They were down to, so 2020."
"26312790","26315410"," Their low was $296. "
"26316990","26321630"," That might be a good short on Samuel Adams to continue that short down to 300."
"26322190","26328730"," When dude, they dropped from 1349 down to 400."
"26330630","26334450"," And they're trading back to March lows as $300. "
"26335190","26335710"," They're still up."
"26337070","26339470"," And they're only down eight bucks after hours."
"26339730","26340470"," That's not that much. "
"26343390","26344430"," It's not that terrible."
"26344770","26349370"," And they got destroyed, and I have to read their guidance overnight and see what they're saying"
"26349370","26351050"," about their future."
"26356210","26357770"," Oh, Christian's thrown it in there. "
"26357910","26358270"," What happened?"
"26359210","26360770"," Data center and gaming miss."
"26360910","26361470"," That's not good."
"26365910","26366870"," Yeah, they're bullshitting. "
"26367970","26368950"," Yes, seltzer."
"26372830","26374270"," So they're data and gaming miss."
"26374410","26376090"," We don't want to see their data center miss. "
"26379570","26380690"," Yes, they are, Ma."
"26382430","26385790"," I was pretty pissed off with, hey, cowboy, have a great night."
"26386770","26390390"," I was really raging pissed about Samuel Adams and what they did. "
"26390570","26391490"," They sold all their stock."
"26392430","26396250"," Then they didn't tell anybody about their huge problems."
"26396530","26399010"," They should have told people they basically committed legal fraud. "
"26399770","26401070"," They scammed the system."
"26405090","26406010"," Yeah, it was crazy."
"26406570","26407010"," I was raging. "
"26407290","26408770"," I was all over Twitter about it."
"26408870","26410270"," I was so fucking pissed off."
"26410730","26418490"," I was so angry that they didn't tell anybody. "
"26418730","26419070"," They could have kept."
"26419270","26420710"," They came out like three days before."
"26420990","26422410"," It was like a week before their earnings. "
"26423990","26426650"," Oh, data and center and gaming beat Henry saying."
"26427570","26431550"," From what I'm reading right here, Nvidia's beat massive."
"26440680","26441820"," Triple H still their lunch. "
"26446810","26448430"," Oh, no, they dropped more than that."
"26448870","26450310"," They dropped like eight or 900 points."
"26451610","26453390"," That was a tweet from Walter Bloomberg. "
