"8300","9940"," before the film begins."
"10440","20180"," This leader is provided"
"20180","27460"," to permit the projectionist to complete adjustment of focus and sound level before the film..."
"49180","49820"," Yes."
"59830","65520"," Alright, let's get this rolling. "
"66220","67220"," I'm gonna fix this."
"71960","73180"," Turn that off."
"74860","77060"," Okay, turn this back on. "
"78160","78180"," Done."
"82600","83800"," Like, YouTube's kind of sketchy."
"83920","90950"," They're like, I want to hit people with non-skippable ads. "
"91190","91690"," We don't want to do that."
"93390","96090"," Hey, good morning, everybody."
"96210","96690"," How are y'all doing?"
"97590","98570"," Just a couple of seconds here. "
"100030","101610"," We'll switch right over to the main screener."
"104090","105470"," We kept selling overnight."
"106910","108850"," I think Ty won a quick second here. "
"115970","117470"," Let's take a look right here."
"120690","121590"," Positioning is short."
"121910","123510"," Kept selling in the overnight last night. "
"123970","126090"," We've got some stuff we had to look at this morning."
"126670","129330"," I would not be buying dips here if you try to buy an opening dip."
"129990","133350"," Even if the dip can be bought here, do not buy it. "
"135210","143490"," You have a target right down below here of 429.54. That is a target."
"144090","147250"," Regardless of any kind of squeezing that goes on, we are going there."
"147810","152570"," There's a high probability, like a 99% chance we're going to go down there and see that. "
"153550","154650"," Keep your eyes on this."
"154850","158290"," We have more than that to talk about though today."
"158530","161430"," I think this is Bailey says I'm not predicting what the next bank. "
"161710","163250"," Normally you get a..."
"164670","165750"," Hold on one quick second."
"165910","167710"," I've got some technical stuff I've got to do in the background."
"168890","170970"," Bailey says we've got a big job to do. "
"171490","172650"," Give me one quick second here."
"182060","184840"," I'm going to do one fast thing in the background."
"187100","193100"," This show might not be your day trading show they're looking for. "
"193180","194620"," I've got calls that are fucking..."
"195300","197120"," I just burned five..."
"197860","199820"," A little bit less than five grand."
"200020","201500"," There's still pennies left on some calls."
"202320","203400"," It's not that bad of a..."
"203400","210720"," I'm like angry about it this morning, but I made slightly over 15K the day before. "
"211280","213820"," On the close, I made a 300% trade."
"214100","219860"," I'm very happy about over 300% but I'm fucking furious that I bought calls for Friday in the close"
"219860","220600"," yesterday."
"222360","224840"," At the same time though, I got to get past all that. "
"225120","226380"," We'll talk about it this morning."
"226380","227160"," Give me just a second here."
"228100","228920"," They're still on. "
"229060","229740"," There's no point in sound."
"229940","231400"," I think they're two cents right now."
"234280","236440"," So they just stay on until the end. "
"237240","241280"," I got to get some quick things I've got to do here in the background."
"242540","248920"," So it's not terrible, but we have bigger fish to fry here."
"249280","257940"," I'm kind of scratching my head over how to present this to you because there's a bear count right?"
"258079","260480"," A bear wave count down to 430. "
"261600","263660"," You guys hear me talk about it all the time."
"265480","275320"," But after that bear count, we're supposed to go quite high and I disagree"
"275320","276420"," with that call."
"276820","281160"," So we're going to talk about that and what needs to happen for that to play out. "
"282860","285280"," After that bear count is finished at 430."
"287880","294560"," There's a thesis that we don't, not only do we go back up, but the correction is over."
"295860","301920"," I'm going to warn you of something alongside a caveat to that correction being over. "
"304680","310240"," And it's not what I'm seeing says, no, it's not a correction that the market's going to roll over,"
"310560","312540"," but it's not a reason to panic at the moment."
"313440","315900"," But you need to keep your eyes on this."
"317160","319640"," So we're going to that we're going to spend this morning. "
"321380","328820"," Going over that with you because on the closed yesterday, I talked about this last hour or so of"
"328820","331040"," the stream yesterday spent on this topic."
"331500","339860"," And there was a bear amount of people in the chat that either disagreed or could not see what I"
"339860","340600"," was talking about."
"340600","348840"," So we're going to we're going to show you this again this morning because when we started the"
"348840","354360"," correction originally, I made a video for the discord and it only had 70 views. "
"354840","358220"," A week or two later, it was a couple thousand views."
"358740","366440"," So maybe these videos have to be made public and not for just discord and I have to make sure"
"366440","367500"," that you're all on the same page."
"367500","372280"," I'm kind of scratching my head after two and a half three years that one says I'm asking people to"
"372280","377360"," look at a day chart and we're trading a five minute or one minute chart and they're both the same. "
"378340","382880"," They both have the same patterns or pettitive patterns and we have people saying I don't see it."
"383000","388820"," So we're going to go over it again this morning because there's a little bit more showing it's like"
"388820","390380"," raring its ugly head here."
"391340","393700"," It's it's giving me cause for concern. "
"394600","399180"," So we'll talk about it this morning in detail and depth."
"399820","402120"," We're going to talk about Jerome yesterday too."
"402360","406900"," I haven't gone back to do a forensic analysis of everything that I wanted to do yesterday on it. "
"407540","410280"," I didn't have the time between yesterday and this morning."
"411040","418900"," I'm going to over the weekend, but I still stand firm in my assessment of what I did see yesterday."
"419680","424060"," And it was an over selling of not only an over selling of. "
"425540","430200"," Not only an over selling of of of higher for longer."
"430760","433520"," You have to look at this from the perspective of before yesterday."
"433820","435900"," What was the plan going into the rate decision?"
"436740","437760"," What was the intent?"
"438420","440340"," And it was to me, Claire's day. "
"441160","442920"," I don't care what people say probably."
"443100","444160"," I guess I've heard a bunch of different."
"444760","452780"," Besides this, but the Fed President has no business showing you guys charts that are meaningless. "
"454260","455760"," They are they're meaningless."
"456380","457480"," Dot plots are meaningless."
"458420","461740"," If you will ever go back and just check dot plots history as they change. "
"461980","463060"," They're they're useless."
"463400","465200"," Anything that's like three, four, five years out."
"466580","470120"," And the unemployment chart that he showed was a fucking disaster. "
"471080","472600"," I got to say that it was a disaster."
"472600","476640"," You can see we're going to look at some of those charts together this morning."
"478540","481920"," And in my view to take away from me this morning. "
"482940","484700"," Just digesting what took place yesterday."
"486060","486560"," Is."
"487900","492640"," I think the banks and I think I feel like this is a not feel I think this is a"
"492640","495080"," challenge between the I think the banks are looking at the Fed. "
"495960","501740"," When the Fed are looking we talked about a Mexican standoff yesterday right with the Fed and the"
"501740","502020"," banks."
"503120","509900"," And the banks wanting to front run their expectation for when hikes will be through and cuts will"
"509900","510280"," be made."
"511299","514480"," And last night I got out and looked at the unemployment rate. "
"515559","520360"," And I'm like they're out of their fucking minds if they think that they're going to be holding and"
"520360","521799"," raising a year from now."
"522640","528380"," Well, I find that very hard to believe that that's where they're going to be."
"528500","531640"," It's possible, but we're going to take a look at the numbers this morning that he showed. "
"531640","532060"," So."
"533760","535920"," In my view at this point."
"538940","542540"," I think there was a need not an easy reaction, but. "
"543040","546060"," Yeah, we're going to expect this guy to come out and say."
"546580","550540"," Fire for longer and a big question mark there right."
"550940","552240"," Maybe he can hold this together. "
"553100","558600"," Into end of year maybe into spring or summer and we start to front run that the latest spring and"
"558600","560120"," summertime start to run it down."
"561480","566740"," But Jerome was like like that we're going well we're going to go through an election doing this and"
"566740","567460"," we're going to go into."
"569440","572280"," At minimum into December of twenty twenty four. "
"572500","574620"," I was like wait a minute."
"574700","575280"," What are you saying here?"
"575400","577500"," We're not tracking that."
"578480","580360"," We're not tracking that with inflation. "
"580580","582060"," We're not tracking that with unemployment."
"582060","584340"," We're not tracking that with."
"585660","592040"," We're not tracking it with any other data that's coming out. "
"592280","594500"," So I don't know what to."
"594860","597800"," I don't know how to resolve that."
"597800","600460"," So I don't know how to resolve that ending. "
"600740","601720"," We haven't had many."
"601940","607240"," We've had four to six instances in history where you'll see the bag."
"607240","607460"," Thanks. "
"607480","608720"," With that context."
"609140","614660"," And we've got does with like the adage that don't fight that does work."
"614940","617020"," But there are a few not a few. "
"617140","619040"," There's about six instances in history where."
"620930","623560"," That second roll down was not fucking pretty."
"623980","630880"," And the fucking fed even truthfully fucking fed is quoted historically quoted as thick and they"
"630880","631680"," saved the day. "
"632300","634820"," And they actually went too far."
"635420","639280"," And I think we're at one of those moments right now with the fed."
"639800","645540"," I think I think Jerome should have stuck yesterday with the skip is fine. "
"646120","649100"," And then some kind of thread the needle we talked about earlier today."
"649360","651380"," And market profile with the fed."
"651640","651680"," Right. "
"652040","652520"," Thread the needle."
"653200","655760"," Skip and make you believe long enough."
"657140","660400"," Until they're going to do a one or two rate increases over time. "
"661140","663960"," But I think once they broke up the charts and they were like, Hey, look, we're looking at this."
"663960","666560"," I do not expect a rate high to like 2030."
"667360","673040"," And they're using charts that someone in Fintuit would use no offense to myself or anyone else. "
"673700","675000"," And this is the Fed chair."
"675300","676320"," Think about it like this."
"677840","679900"," If you're the president, right?"
"680460","681560"," You're the president. "
"683200","687320"," You know, I used a really bad comparison with a friend last night."
"687720","689640"," But I said to him last night, I was like."
"690220","695180"," You know, this is like Harry Truman coming out with a pointing stick on a chart trying to tell you"
"695180","697300"," what the calm is on interest rates. "
"697700","698140"," They're not going to."
"698260","700540"," Harry Truman was not going to do that."
"700820","700920"," Right. "
"701340","703960"," This is the chairman of the Federal Reserve."
"704560","712320"," He has no need to break out charts to sell anything to anyone where we are right now."
"712320","716600"," And so it's an oversell of the point he's trying to make. "
"717180","719880"," And when you're trying to oversell a point, you're trying to make."
"721620","722920"," It panics people."
"723600","725660"," It panicked me seeing that yesterday. "
"725800","728960"," You saw me on stream yesterday going, what the fuck is he doing right now?"
"730340","731460"," And that's real."
"731980","734480"," Like he, he does not, when I say he doesn't have any business."
"735980","739720"," My point is that he is the, he's the chairman of the Federal Reserve. "
"739720","741180"," He go at him saying."
"741800","747640"," And so he doesn't know that explanation or a chart to anyone out there and it certainly doesn't."
"747780","750000"," Oh, indicating inflation to you. "
"750080","752020"," I can't say."
"752100","755520"," I don't want to say the way I want to say, but we passed that one over."
"756920","761820"," The other thought behind the chart showing yesterday, I had another friend last night saying to me. "
"762700","768820"," It's possible that he was showing those charts because of a possible government shutdown."
"769860","771900"," So as maybe being used as a vehicle."
"775590","780580"," Until he gets the question, where are you going to get your data if the government shuts down. "
"781000","786660"," And the Fed chair is not supposed to answer the way that he answered that question either."
"786660","794360"," When you are the fucking chair or the fucking president or the fucking CEO, I'm going to swear a"
"794360","795060"," lot this morning."
"796340","798400"," You don't owe anyone. "
"799680","801000"," I don't know."
"802660","803720"," That's not your job."
"803900","808080"," Your job as a CEO says, we've been working on getting that data for you if the government shuts"
"808080","808480"," down. "
"808680","813300"," At least have a cursory outline of what's going to happen."
"814560","815860"," Or answer with."
"816040","818200"," We have people working on this right now. "
"818400","819920"," That was not the answer that was given yesterday."
"821820","825340"," There's a couple of key moments inside of that."
"825920","828900"," There are a couple of key moments said it's being just where they were. "
"829960","832900"," I started laughing on stream because I was shocked that."
"834520","838200"," That was allowed to happen for the chairman."
"844060","847220"," I'm still kind of flabbergasted. "
"847260","849060"," I didn't watch it yesterday."
"849740","851600"," Joe Donut didn't get a chance to watch it."
"851680","853140"," I'm like, he watches all of them. "
"853200","855280"," I'm like, dude, you got to watch this one."
"856260","859460"," It's like fucking pure insanity."
"860020","862120"," Or at least from my perspective, I watch all these things. "
"862880","864380"," And whenever I see something like this."
"865300","868600"," It'll always leaves whatever something like this specifically happens."
"868800","869980"," I'm scratching my head. "
"872180","873640"," How did we get to this point?"
"873940","874820"," Did they drive?"
"875160","878400"," I figured they were the last rate meeting the hat."
"878560","880080"," I was like, man, he got prepped for this one."
"880680","881480"," He knows what's up. "
"881660","884180"," He knows exactly how to deal with public."
"884360","888000"," So whatever the writer was, they run through this two or three times."
"888000","889720"," I was impressed yesterday. "
"889720","895700"," If they had dry run that or put that in a room and rehearsed it with some interns or something."
"896500","899220"," I don't know who the fuck said yes to that."
"899640","901860"," If they worked for me, I'd fucking fire them. "
"902480","903360"," Fucking yesterday."
"904380","905360"," I show you not."
"905500","906780"," I was sat there and fired his ass. "
"907380","907500"," So."
"915510","916030"," You know what?"
"916490","920890"," I wanted to make a joke this morning that I was going to get a fin to it yesterday."
"920890","923770"," I was going to get a fin to it yesterday and say, hold on. "
"923890","924270"," You got some."
"924370","926050"," Here goes your targets for down below, by the way."
"926910","930810"," If you don't have your levels of for this morning, we got a S two or set not parked on"
"930810","931670"," S two right now. "
"932030","933550"," Next stop down below."
"935050","936150"," S three down here."
"938010","938950"," We're going down there. "
"939090","941970"," So sooner sooner later."
"942150","942430"," Doesn't matter."
"942530","943010"," That's where we're going. "
"943910","944390"," So."
"946090","947290"," Fucking was smart."
"947450","949350"," I was going to make a joke on fin to it because. "
"951510","952350"," The fed."
"952750","956490"," I just read the fed release three months ago."
"956590","956910"," The fed. "
"957290","960310"," So the fed releases a bunch of shit that a lot of people don't read."
"961530","966870"," They like they'll tell you that they're cute queuing and then they'll release data."
"968490","968930"," Quietly. "
"969470","972210"," From the Federal Reserve site, they're released like a notice."
"973050","976710"," And you got to get on like a rabbit hole and read a bunch of PDFs to find out what"
"976710","977710"," they're actually fucking doing."
"979430","983530"," Then it's obvious that just enough that most people won't follow the rabbit hole. "
"984110","988290"," He was famous for doing this too is Jedi Marcus will be down the rabbit"
"988290","996830"," hole off the time."
"996830","997210"," And they're not."
"997970","999910"," They're just they're just giving it to just passive. "
"1000090","1001450"," One fucking banks or the bank."
"1001770","1002970"," Like that."
"1003390","1005510"," So the most recent one was. "
"1006630","1011170"," The most recent one was the fed admitted to scraping Twitter."
"1011870","1013510"," And not only scraping Twitter."
"1013770","1014850"," They're like scraping Twitter. "
"1015610","1022070"," And looking for some extremely archaic words in their searches."
"1023069","1027930"," So they're trying to seek out words that a retailer will use."
"1027930","1031690"," They try to seek out words that a professional will use. "
"1032450","1036730"," And professionals from different parts of our markets."
"1037290","1042690"," So something only a bond trader would say something that only a professional bond trader would say."
"1043310","1047270"," Only analysts would say the only retailer would say. "
"1048230","1053770"," And then they're telling all of these all of this data right now."
"1054210","1056410"," They're going to be paying an arm to like this shit too."
"1056470","1056690"," I don't know. "
"1057130","1059370"," It's got to be stupid what they're paying for it."
"1059710","1062470"," But then they're then they're running it through AI right now."
"1062530","1066870"," You know I learned language models and they're spitting out what the market thinks. "
"1067790","1071530"," They're crafting some of these statements to what they're finding on social media."
"1072150","1074270"," This is real shit that they're doing right now."
"1075450","1076590"," That's speech yesterday. "
"1077410","1082230"," And the shit that he was doing in that speech just screamed to me."
"1084350","1086910"," It's Jerome Powell hanging out a bit to it like."
"1087290","1090850"," And I don't think that he's hanging out a bit to it. "
"1091610","1097190"," But it's screaming to me that someone grabbed the hold of that."
"1097190","1105350"," AI shit that they popped out and crafted a response or a press release around whatever data they're"
"1105350","1105670"," collecting."
"1105990","1108870"," That's what I took from that speech yesterday. "
"1109470","1111050"," I found it very disturbing."
"1111890","1113170"," Deeply deeply disturbing."
"1113550","1119210"," So some of you might be aware of this or not that they do this or that they're doing this. "
"1119210","1120050"," It's probably looked up."
"1120170","1124130"," The Federal Reserve using AI right now."
"1124490","1127390"," The banks have been doing it for a long period of time. "
"1127850","1131210"," I think years now, but they've come to they admitted it."
"1131230","1134010"," The banks admitted it I think six months ago or nine months ago."
"1135250","1136790"," So we're going to talk about. "
"1138990","1140430"," In my view, I think."
"1141270","1145490"," I think the banks in the Fed pretty much looked at each other yesterday and."
"1145990","1148890"," I would say that data scientists from banks. "
"1150250","1152610"," Are in full disagreements with the fed."
"1153850","1158610"," And I think the banks are okay with the fed saying we're going to write we're going to keep hiking."
"1158610","1159750"," We're going to raise. "
"1160130","1162330"," We're going to keep hiking and hold for longer."
"1163310","1167510"," But I think when the fed comes out and starts to break out of chart for 2030."
"1168490","1172710"," That there's some disagreements and there's some pushback on that on that thesis. "
"1172710","1173450"," So."
"1175530","1176890"," Is over selling."
"1177790","1182030"," A position, even if you held until December of twenty twenty four. "
"1183010","1184010"," It's still."
"1184950","1189010"," It's still a little bizarre to see a fed shared do what he did yesterday in my view."
"1189010","1189330"," So. "
"1190190","1191010"," The reaction."
"1192090","1194290"," I don't disagree with the reaction to this."
"1195070","1197490"," And the fed has been wrong. "
"1197870","1198990"," This is the key point."
"1200270","1202170"," The positive that they made yesterday."
"1202970","1205490"," They did not have to extend that positive. "
"1206450","1207550"," Yesterday publicly."
"1208230","1208990"," And when they did."
"1209740","1211350"," They're putting their chips on the table. "
"1211810","1213990"," And if I was a bank."
"1214610","1215030"," Right now."
"1215450","1217610"," I would likely disagree with them as well. "
"1217790","1219430"," You're so far away at an agreement."
"1219890","1228970"," You got a bank saying let's do it now."
"1229470","1232310"," But then the federal reserve comes out yesterday instead of being here. "
"1232810","1235390"," The feds over here saying fuck no this is what's going to happen."
"1235630","1239750"," And the data does not support that the data does not support that so."
"1240450","1245050"," My view this is going to be a disagreement amongst the amongst them coming closer together. "
"1245630","1247270"," Or if I was a bank."
"1247970","1254650"," I would try to force the fed into capitulation sooner than they are going to tell you publicly."
"1256170","1257750"," What their fucking plan is. "
"1257750","1265190"," And we have at least six examples of this historically where the fed has been wrong and wrong in a"
"1265190","1267070"," really significant way."
"1268070","1269170"," Maybe that's ego."
"1269510","1270250"," I don't know what it is. "
"1270250","1270590"," I have some."
"1270810","1273330"," I have a fucking friend that works the fed."
"1273850","1276330"," And the stories that I hear. "
"1277610","1280370"," About the fed is it's just like everywhere else."
"1280570","1283070"," You've got a guy or a man or woman."
"1283950","1286710"," The little fed presidents doesn't matter. "
"1286890","1287370"," They have teams."
"1287370","1290650"," Very smart people that work for them."
"1291570","1292610"," It's still. "
"1293610","1299310"," To this day today comes down to a chair or a president's ego."
"1300830","1302630"," Even knowing all the data."
"1303610","1306410"," A lot of the decision making still comes down to. "
"1307130","1310590"," I know what I'm doing more than you know what you're doing right."
"1310590","1313450"," Smart people you got a hundred smart people and."
"1314510","1316890"," What's what what's shocking about this is. "
"1317330","1318950"," The statement is made is that."
"1319610","1322730"," They have more leeway than one percent now."
"1322830","1324370"," Any kind of corporation has. "
"1325510","1327610"," In their decision making process."
"1328210","1329190"," You can't."
"1329430","1330970"," If you're if you're a director. "
"1332030","1333750"," And you have people that work for you."
"1334010","1337590"," And they give you a well researched."
"1340070","1342590"," Data for your decision making in your department. "
"1345730","1350950"," You follow that if you go against that you go to your direct report and say hey I'm being presented"
"1350950","1352750"," with this time but I want to go another way."
"1353510","1357270"," The fed that's not the case for the fed they can't do whatever they want."
"1357590","1358970"," And leading index change of. "
"1359210","1363610"," Without reporting someone higher up and it could also I was also told that say maybe it's an exit"
"1363610","1364230"," plan for."
"1364230","1366270"," Yours and consumer confidence flash."
"1366430","1367730"," So there's a lot of wild. "
"1368590","1371990"," Pieces of slide on flying around with some friends last night but."
"1373970","1375090"," I wasn't impressed."
"1375650","1378550"," I was slightly taken aback that the fed press. "
"1379550","1380870"," Did what he did yesterday."
"1380990","1381730"," We're trading four 34."
"1382210","1382990"," Oh eight right now. "
"1383790","1387050"," Looking to trade three forty four thirty fifty four."
"1387630","1392050"," Now the discussion that we're going to have today from August last year was talking to."
"1392050","1393770"," to a biggie this morning before the show. "
"1394470","1397870"," And I'm like, I'm late, I gotta get on because they're gonna think I don't want to be here because"
"1397870","1399250"," it's burning or whatever."
"1399670","1404490"," And I'm like, I gotta get on the stream, but I was talking to Biggie about what I want to"
"1404490","1405270"," talk to you about this morning."
"1405270","1406730"," I don't want to create panic. "
"1408050","1409670"," Cause there's no reason to panic."
"1410610","1412910"," I'm gonna explain it to you, thank you very much."
"1412910","1413590"," I appreciate it. "
"1414030","1420410"," There's no reason to panic, but there is a reason if you're an investor of this market that you are"
"1420410","1428490"," looking for some really specific things from this point forward to possibly happen."
"1428810","1434690"," And if you are a bull, you're an investor, you are 100% on the defensive right now."
"1435110","1439230"," You're going to hear bears tell you that this is just the correction. "
"1439310","1442350"," You're gonna hit 430, we're gonna bounce, we're gonna continue the upside."
"1442810","1444610"," That is possible and probable."
"1444930","1452570"," We can actually, we actually trade 460 still and still be in a cell, the market positioning. "
"1452890","1454210"," So we're gonna look at that today."
"1454950","1460010"," We're gonna look at what bulls need to get back into a bullish stance."
"1462230","1465230"," And what do they need to see for that to happen?"
"1465550","1471730"," And I think they're gonna be a little bit shocked here on that answer because it's not buying 430"
"1472090","1476670"," and saying, hey, we're gonna see 460, 470, 480 and that kind of stuff. "
"1476670","1477610"," It's much higher."
"1477870","1479690"," So we're gonna take a look at that."
"1480070","1482990"," And I'm gonna show you guys a whole bunch of stuff in the background. "
"1484950","1487150"," Hope, I think they're gonna come out and do damage control."
"1487550","1492390"," I'm almost certain that you're gonna see Jerome come out and try to do some kind of damage control"
"1492390","1496070"," coming up here quickly because this should panic the market."
"1496950","1503950"," I'm not panicked, but this should panic the market at some point and there should be a panic. "
"1504270","1505770"," So we'll talk about that too."
"1506670","1509310"," At some point this morning, I would panic."
"1509310","1513750"," And if you're an investor in panic, it would be easier exit if it's going to happen. "
"1514130","1515350"," We're not confirmed yet."
"1515550","1519230"," And the bears have two or three things to do to confirm that move down."
"1519430","1522070"," They have to do those things to confirm that move down. "
"1522210","1526010"," So we'll talk about that stuff this morning as well."
"1526070","1531330"," So we're gonna shift right now at the moment to a larger time frame chart."
"1531830","1534130"," We're gonna start with a smaller time frame chart. "
"1534130","1537650"," And we're gonna talk about something real quick."
"1537670","1538350"," Just me in one minute."
"1538930","1540330"," Morning, by the way, how's everybody doing out there?"
"1540750","1541910"," We're doing some coffee real quick. "
"1542570","1544290"," We see what the chat's saying this morning."
"1544490","1546970"," Good morning, by the way, all of you you're showing up today."
"1547790","1548990"," See what you guys are doing this morning. "
"1550670","1551490"," Good morning, everybody."
"1552150","1552730"," How y'all doing?"
"1557600","1560020"," Oh, no, they are, you are incorrect there."
"1560380","1561620"," Oh, no, no, no, no, you're right. "
"1562420","1567720"," They are, hold on, someone just wrote, they're never wrong by accident."
"1568300","1570180"," They are sometimes wrong by accident."
"1571080","1577940"," I just, I agree with you, but I wholeheartedly disagree with you because I have read the"
"1577940","1584780"," manuscripts written from a lot of these presidents when we've had major downturns, 2000, 2008. "
"1586180","1590160"," There's, it's wild to read a lot of what these fed people say."
"1592820","1594420"," When, when it actually happens."
"1594960","1596380"," So we got to address it this morning. "
"1596520","1601200"," We got, I have to get it out there just so that you can't say, I don't know what that's"
"1601200","1601320"," saying."
"1601440","1604640"," The only reason I'm telling you this is I don't want you to say you didn't tell me."
"1604740","1606660"," So I need you to have this morning. "
"1606720","1611140"," I need you to know the real risk down the road from here."
"1611200","1612360"," We have a website that I sent out to you."
"1612660","1613680"," So you're just aware of it. "
"1613680","1614640"," We got to these places."
"1615040","1618240"," We're going to go and check and make sure that these things don't happen."
"1621020","1623160"," Like I'm on the, I'm on team destruction. "
"1623240","1625320"," Like I'm on team layoffs."
"1625560","1627320"," I'm on team like I want to see unemployment."
"1627960","1628920"," Like I want to see unemployment. "
"1629340","1630600"," I want to see a market crash."
"1631080","1634520"," I don't think there's a bear, a bull out there that doesn't want to see a true market crash."
"1635380","1640980"," But when the feds saying there are moments where they think they're saving some things, but they're"
"1640980","1644580"," not, Janet Yellen is famous for this. "
"1644740","1647920"," I don't know if you know her, if you've known her for 20, 30, 40 fucking years."
"1649220","1650740"," She's a fucking disaster."
"1651800","1656640"," And I would need you to understand something if you're young. "
"1658080","1665680"," There was a deal made with Americans, most specifically after World War II, after the Great"
"1665680","1670280"," Depression, after World War II, there was a deal made with Americans."
"1671500","1677680"," And this is one of our, this is one of the foundations of capitalism today."
"1678820","1680740"," And I need you to understand this if you're young. "
"1683520","1692760"," When we go through short and long term debt cycles in this country, the Fed, this is after the"
"1692760","1700540"," Great Depression, after World War II, the agreement was you would be able to work your ass off for"
"1700540","1701540"," the rest of your life, right?"
"1702600","1711500"," Buy a home on a credit and regardless of the economic cycle that we were in, regardless that the"
"1711500","1718440"," greatest thing you could do, your best investment that you could ever make, our entire tax"
"1718440","1728260"," structure is built around you, going to school, getting married, having children, buying a"
"1728260","1730800"," home and investing in that home."
"1732120","1733220"," That's the agreement."
"1734360","1738680"," Whether you do that or not, or whether you don't want to do that, or whether you like doing that"
"1738680","1743180"," or not, or whether you're like, I'm never getting married, never having kids, our system is built"
"1743180","1743860"," around that. "
"1745540","1755140"," And there's a secret squirrel mandate, even in the Fed, that we want to do destruction, but we can"
"1755140","1761840"," never fuck with that one investment that we have that agreement with Americans to save."
"1762480","1770760"," And the last example of that that I can explain, the last example of that we had was, there's two"
"1770760","1780560"," examples, of course, we had the housing crisis, but there was a moment where banks were not going"
"1780560","1784260"," to pay most Americans over the weekend."
"1785160","1790440"," And this was the famous scene where George Bush was setting on the steps of the capital and he was"
"1790440","1793480"," surrounded by senators and some Fed officials. "
"1794880","1804200"," And just he had just been briefed to say, texts are not going out to major corporations workers"
"1804730","1805980"," around the United States."
"1807060","1812960"," And the previous example of that was, of course, Janet Yellen saying, at least we saved people's"
"1812960","1815000"," homes, and they didn't."
"1815340","1816440"," People lost their homes. "
"1817220","1818480"," It was the greatest investment they ever had."
"1818480","1820640"," These are people that did actually make their mortgage payments."
"1821100","1823340"," These are people that did the right thing and had a job. "
"1823820","1828360"," These are people that did not overextend themselves and they still lost what they had."
"1828600","1833020"," So, now trying to hold S2 right now."
"1834040","1840760"," So yes, they want that destruction, but there are parts of that destruction that they do not want"
"1840760","1841460"," is my point. "
"1842260","1849160"," And when they get past that point of destruction, when they get past that point of destruction,"
"1851260","1858180"," when they get past that point of destruction, they've gone too far and they don't, they didn't know"
"1858180","1859420"," that they had gone too far."
"1859960","1869860"," And they risk really great, great harm to you as a person, more than you have likely, unless"
"1869860","1876600"," you're a soldier and unless you've traveled the world outside of resorts in a third world country,"
"1877120","1878780"," do you have any idea what that looks like?"
"1879240","1885180"," If you have any family members or any stories from the Great Depression, it was fucking terrible."
"1885680","1886900"," It was really bad. "
"1887800","1893160"," It was, nothing can describe how horrible it was in the United States."
"1893480","1896880"," And that's part of what we said, we never wanna go through that again, right?"
"1897300","1899660"," We never wanna have that ever happen again in this country."
"1900420","1904240"," And we've had some very close moments of that happening again in this country. "
"1905000","1910240"," So we're gonna talk about today, what some of the possible implications are down the road."
"1910800","1914980"," And if you're a bull, how do you get out of those implications down the road?"
"1915140","1916320"," So we're gonna talk about that this morning."
"1918180","1920260"," We're gonna bounce right now on S2. "
"1922960","1924740"," We're gonna chat about this right now."
"1924860","1925640"," Give me a quick second here."
"1932890","1934470"," This is SPX, right?"
"1934470","1936510"," I'll take a second here. "
"1943150","1946210"," Let's see if we can go to, I wanna show you something."
"1946470","1955070"," So if this was, if this was any chart on any time frame, this could be a five minute time"
"1955070","1958090"," frame, one minute time frame, doesn't really matter."
"1958250","1960390"," This is a one minute SPX time frame. "
"1961530","1965770"," But there's something important here for you to watch, so we're in a one minute time frame right"
"1965770","1966190"," here, okay?"
"1969780","1974580"," We're gonna talk about crosses."
"1975020","1976780"," So this is a white line here."
"1976900","1978700"," You can make this a 21 EMA. "
"1979160","1982140"," You can make it a 27 or 30, it doesn't matter."
"1982320","1986800"," But this is basically a 21, this white line 21, 20, 70 EMA doesn't matter."
"1987620","1989420"," This is a 129 EMA. "
"1989700","1995240"," This is, it could be a 126, 130, it doesn't matter somewhere in that range."
"1995700","1996840"," You pick it where you want it."
"1997900","2000960"," This is a one minute chart, it's a one minute time frame chart. "
"2003160","2008520"," And I want you to see how these charts actually work, right?"
"2009540","2020340"," We don't ever wanna be caught inside of a, we don't ever wanna get caught with price"
"2023500","2025780"," inside of these crosses, right?"
"2025920","2027300"," We don't ever wanna get caught in here."
"2027960","2031540"," These can resolve to the upside or to the downside, okay?"
"2032860","2034320"," Oh, that's not the best drawing here."
"2034440","2038560"," But whatever you're consolidating at that point is, so we're coming down to price right here,"
"2038620","2038820"," right?"
"2039440","2045220"," And right at this moment, you don't know if you're gonna get the breakdown, the confirmation of the"
"2045220","2047639"," move lower, right?"
"2047639","2051600"," Or just the breakdown, but no confirmation of the move higher, right?"
"2052659","2057780"," You wanna take the trade on a confirmation. "
"2059060","2062060"," I got a break higher here, right?"
"2062400","2064600"," Bounces down to confirm and rolls lower."
"2065699","2069639"," Price did not get above that white line and head higher, right?"
"2070420","2077620"," We call it the Chinese finger trap is one of the famous ones, right?"
"2077620","2078780"," Let's look at Spyro quick."
"2078940","2079920"," It does a better job of it yesterday. "
"2081480","2086800"," So yesterday, when we were up inside here, this is yesterday's trading, right?"
"2087360","2093600"," And yesterday, we had a blue, a gray bar, a yellow bar and a green bar."
"2094080","2095340"," And we said bullish above."
"2097100","2098840"," So this is a one minute chart, right?"
"2099560","2100540"," Yesterday, we had a bar there. "
"2100720","2101520"," We had a bar here."
"2101880","2104480"," And I said to you, I'm bearish below."
"2108340","2110140"," And I'm bullish above, right?"
"2110520","2113420"," This was yesterday, right?"
"2117040","2118480"," Not fucking around in here. "
"2118620","2125000"," I wanna see the break above confirmation, move higher, jump on a trade, right?"
"2125280","2128760"," Break below confirmation, start trading lower, right?"
"2129300","2132180"," Boom, and you had the cross right here, the bear cross right there."
"2132920","2133860"," All bad, right?"
"2134660","2137500"," All bad, go down, bearish, into the close yesterday."
"2138960","2140440"," There's a one minute chart, right?"
"2140660","2141860"," Just a one minute chart here. "
"2142340","2145460"," You can see these same things on higher timeframes."
"2146320","2149680"," You can see them on that 21 and 126."
"2151020","2152800"," Right here, you can see the same thing. "
"2153120","2155680"," You can see the same thing on a 15 minute time frame."
"2155720","2158340"," You can see it on a one hour time frame."
"2159040","2168870"," Here we'll go to, you can see it here on, you see the cross"
"2168870","2169450"," right here. "
"2169450","2175390"," And then you see significant downside for a period of time on a one hour chart, right?"
"2176310","2178610"," With big price discovery to the downside."
"2179210","2182490"," Same thing once you get to the upside, big moves to the upside, right?"
"2182690","2183350"," Big price changes."
"2184190","2185690"," These are big trends, right?"
"2185890","2186490"," One hour trends. "
"2186830","2191770"," Then you go to a four hour and you get kind of like a super trend, right?"
"2192990","2195010"," And so let's look at a four hour right now."
"2195990","2201810"," This is spy and we have a super trend to the downside right below here, right?"
"2201970","2204470"," Two days ago and where was the confirmation?"
"2205330","2206670"," It was yesterday, right?"
"2207350","2214070"," We had the cross four sessions ago, one, two, three, four, but here's where it got ugly."
"2215030","2220870"," We were parked up in here yesterday and we couldn't get above this line right here. "
"2220930","2221330"," What happened?"
"2222290","2224590"," Bloodbath to the downside, right?"
"2224590","2225710"," Bloodbath to the downside."
"2226410","2231770"," That's our confirmation for a super trend to the downside, super trend."
"2232430","2234950"," You wanna see what super trends are when we do that?"
"2235150","2236210"," They're pretty nasty, right?"
"2237110","2239330"," Do you wanna see the last time this happened?"
"2240090","2243690"," What happened is pretty big, huge move to the downside here. "
"2244590","2246070"," Wanna see the last time what happened?"
"2246870","2250250"," Giant downside move, consolidation for multiple sessions."
"2251510","2254570"," Then higher, right?"
"2255210","2258150"," Some really scary ones back here, right?"
"2258350","2260390"," This is way, way back here in September."
"2260850","2263170"," Big old blast down, right?"
"2263470","2265010"," You wanna see really bad ones?"
"2265090","2266690"," Here's a really bad one right there. "
"2267130","2268710"," This is when we're risk off, right?"
"2269470","2277570"," For long periods of time, major risk off, major down moves, continuation, once we're risk off in"
"2277570","2278550"," the marketplace, right?"
"2279710","2281950"," How do you know if you're risk off here?"
"2282950","2288270"," Do you see how you've got some down on the four hour, you've got some down, but it's not risk"
"2288270","2288810"," off, right?"
"2288870","2289590"," It's just a correction."
"2290290","2297030"," How do you actually confirm if it's just a correction or if it's the start of major downside to"
"2297030","2297230"," come?"
"2298450","2301530"," So what we're gonna look at next is the daily chart."
"2302870","2305270"," Okay, we're not quite there yet, are we?"
"2305970","2307750"," We're not quite there yet. "
"2307870","2310870"," We have not, I want you to point your attention right here."
"2312670","2317390"," Right, you did not have a cross of that white line of the red line, right?"
"2318450","2322390"," But we do have examples of when that white line did cross, right?"
"2323230","2325590"," And what that signifies, right?"
"2326330","2328170"," So we haven't done this yet."
"2328790","2330570"," We have not done this yet. "
"2331750","2334290"," Either one of these we have not done, you can see it."
"2335170","2337630"," But we're getting to this point, right?"
"2338250","2343550"," We're getting to where we're going to see this or we're going to see this over here."
"2344410","2354130"," And I want to also draw your attention to previous examples where the white line did not cross and"
"2354130","2357270"," even in this cross, we got a massive move lower. "
"2357730","2361770"," But that cross is usually pretty, pretty bad."
"2361930","2363150"," Here's another example right there."
"2363290","2364250"," There's a big one right there. "
"2365370","2367210"," We got a huge one right here, right?"
"2368910","2377330"," So no matter the time frame in the coming weeks, what you're going to be looking for, this is spoos"
"2377330","2382850"," right here, spy, not SPX, but this is showing that same formation, right?"
"2383630","2385610"," What should you be expecting here?"
"2388530","2397760"," You're going to be expecting, see that curl down right there?"
"2398320","2400860"," You're going to be expecting that curl to continue."
"2409820","2412140"," You see that roll starting right now."
"2412160","2413180"," I'm going to show you something else. "
"2413320","2414320"," I got a bunch of stuff to show you guys."
"2414580","2415600"," So say it all."
"2415720","2416420"," I'm showing you today. "
"2419020","2421640"," This is what you don't want to see happen."
"2425660","2429440"," What you don't want to see happen is failures."
"2430160","2432100"," What should we close this gap today?"
"2434700","2436760"," We close this whole gap today, right?"
"2436860","2437720"," You got a nice green bar. "
"2437940","2440480"," You got no willingness from buyers to buy it."
"2440660","2442860"," Go right back down here."
"2443000","2444100"," Touch that 435. "
"2447880","2449160"," Right, fam right up."
"2449340","2450620"," Let's say go right back up there."
"2451220","2453900"," We just start grinding this straight down, right?"
"2457710","2460190"," You got the bulls, the one last chance right there. "
"2460190","2462530"," And then boom."
"2462950","2465530"," You get below that 430, right?"
"2465810","2467810"," So that 430 is the key, right?"
"2469710","2471350"," We get below that 430."
"2471990","2477370"," So if you're a bull or a bear, if you're able to get below that 430, clean that mess up"
"2477370","2477910"," right there. "
"2479970","2482410"," And they just keep selling this, right?"
"2483310","2484570"," You just start selling this."
"2485050","2485790"," And that's it."
"2485850","2486490"," It's pretty ugly. "
"2487350","2489110"," You see what my point is here?"
"2489110","2498490"," So this 27 EMA, 21 EMA, 27 EMA is going to be critical for you"
"2498490","2503950"," in the coming weeks as a bear and bull."
"2504250","2508810"," So I want you at home to create an alert for yourself."
"2509670","2514070"," You can create alerts on these lines and any charting software you have at home, you can right"
"2514070","2517490"," click usually on them and you can add to a watch list. "
"2517490","2519930"," You can create an alert, whatever you want to do."
"2521010","2528390"," And what you're going to be looking for is price to reject off this 27 EMA on a one day"
"2528390","2533030"," chart on SPX on spy."
"2534190","2541730"," And if we continue to reject off this 27 EMA on the daily, it's going to be a very large"
"2541730","2545050"," warning for you to exit the market. "
"2545050","2547090"," Okay, right in here."
"2547350","2553210"," Now, if you're a bull, if you are a bull, if you are any kind of a bull, you have"
"2553210","2562450"," zero trades in my opinion until you regain"
"2562450","2565210"," that 27 EMA with a con."
"2565510","2569490"," Remember this confirmation and a higher previous high. "
"2569750","2571010"," So let's see that high right there."
"2572350","2574930"," You can fail that high, but it has to get higher."
"2575230","2580170"," So the point here would be, let's say today at this moment, this is the bottom. "
"2580530","2582830"," Someone said to me last night, this is the bottom cap."
"2583150","2584530"," Okay, so this is the bottom, right?"
"2585390","2587910"," You need to break that high."
"2588430","2589170"," You can fail there. "
"2590590","2596210"," Come back down and confirm that you're going higher again."
"2597210","2598230"," What is that?"
"2598410","2599630"," That's late October."
"2601050","2602450"," Likely late October. "
"2603190","2608930"," It's like likely, not guaranteed, but sometime in mid October, late October, you might get that"
"2608930","2609930"," opportunity as a bull."
"2611030","2618170"," But for me personally, I don't trust anything below this white line from this point forward."
"2618790","2624510"," From this point forward, you're getting a warning shot across the bar or across the bow here"
"2624510","2629450"," telling you, unless you regain this stuff, you've got no story, no thesis. "
"2629830","2631150"," And I would never, ever."
"2632650","2638250"," I want to buy spy in a low and I'm like, I can't buy this here in a low too"
"2638250","2645070"," many instances of that role right there, shaping itself up and you just getting ripped down to the"
"2645070","2646050"," depths of health."
"2646050","2656050"," So, if it behooves you as an investor at this point to keep"
"2656050","2665770"," your eye set and alert for price crossing above 27 21 EMA on a daily chart. "
"2667710","2670890"," Now we're going to go to something else really quick."
"2671230","2672190"," Give me one quick second here."
"2672270","2673310"," I'm going to set it up. "
"2673310","2686200"," And we're going"
"2686200","2689180"," to take a look at the trigger screen really quick."
"2691600","2696180"," And I want to show you why I'm kind of paranoid here, right?"
"2698360","2701980"," Not completely paranoid here, but kind of paranoid here."
"2702080","2703860"," So this is a spy. "
"2704220","2705880"," It doesn't matter if it's spy or SPX."
"2709140","2711960"," But I do want to show you."
"2713040","2714560"," So here's SPX. "
"2715580","2718280"," I do want to show you PPO and PMO."
"2718760","2722600"," And we have the blue line here crossing underneath the red line."
"2723540","2725600"," We had a chance to save this. "
"2727360","2729380"," Yesterday, and we did not."
"2730480","2732740"," PPO broke through yesterday as well."
"2732740","2734100"," I'm going to show you these here. "
"2735460","2740200"," And I want to show you that it is likely not the end of down here."
"2740480","2744480"," I want to show you this is not likely the end of down at minimum."
"2745260","2748460"," You're looking for a break of that zero line at minimum here. "
"2750160","2753180"," For a reversal to the downside on spoos."
"2753460","2758420"," And furthermore, if at any point it continues to the downside down here."
"2760020","2762460"," And start rejecting to the downside right here. "
"2762480","2765380"," It's going to get really nasty for you."
"2765600","2766880"," Has not confirmed yet."
"2767460","2770280"," Is this the bottom of the downside?"
"2771820","2773260"," No, historically not. "
"2773620","2777540"," Not just historically, but you see this way to see this bottoming down."
"2777680","2781260"," It is kind of the best you can be hoping for right here."
"2781260","2782720"," So you got more down to come. "
"2782840","2785280"," You can see that last little blast down right there."
"2785280","2788420"," Last little blast down right there, then the hook higher."
"2789300","2792860"," And even then look at how down we were right there. "
"2793020","2794320"," I want you to see that right there."
"2794540","2795580"," Not quite down right."
"2796140","2797620"," This is probably where we are. "
"2797720","2801400"," We have a little bit more little squeeze higher than blast straight back down again."
"2802220","2805620"," But then we have other examples of worse, right?"
"2806000","2806360"," Come down."
"2806640","2808420"," We fail and then start heading down. "
"2809000","2809900"," So right here, right?"
"2810160","2810540"," Come down."
"2810940","2812640"," Squeeze higher and then bam to the downside."
"2814260","2818240"," So right now, if you're a bull, I got nothing for you. "
"2818400","2819760"," I got nothing for saving trend."
"2820600","2822480"," I got nothing for anyone telling you."
"2822860","2825900"," If anyone's telling you out there, hey, we roll down here at 430. "
"2826440","2828740"," And we're going to just keep going higher, crank and higher."
"2829520","2832820"," There's a roll above that you're not seeing on the 27 EMA."
"2833440","2837880"," That's coming down to attempt to stop that and send it straight down. "
"2838260","2842860"," So I need you to be aware of that 27 EMA here for when it rolls down and over."
"2843440","2845140"," And do we break above it or not?"
"2845360","2851960"," And even when we break above it, it has to back test it for us to make that continuation higher."
"2852380","2855580"," So if you're a bull, you've got no business buying this. "
"2856060","2857680"," You got no business buying 430."
"2858460","2864220"," You have to wait until it comes back down that 27 EMA picks it back up and then you can"
"2864220","2866160"," wait for the continuation to the upside."
"2866420","2868980"," You can enter somewhere like right here. "
"2869660","2872300"," But you cannot enter on this bottom down here."
"2872360","2875340"," I guess you can enter in a weekly trade or a daily trade."
"2875960","2881460"," But I would not be trusting this as, hey, hey, correction over, go higher. "
"2881740","2886040"," This is a prime chance for getting caught."
"2886540","2891140"," This is a prime opportunity to get caught in a major role to the downside on spoos."
"2891600","2893000"," So not looking healthy here. "
"2893440","2895200"," Do bulls still have a chance to save it?"
"2895420","2895640"," Sure."
"2896800","2898500"," Is it, is this the bottom?"
"2899060","2901220"," Fuck no, not the bottom."
"2902000","2906040"," Have we rolled higher yet on PPOs and PMOs?"
"2906240","2906400"," Nope. "
"2907160","2909800"," Does this look like it's going to turn around today on the upside?"
"2910480","2910600"," Nope."
"2911320","2914300"," Does this look like it's going to turn around on the upside right now?"
"2914620","2914920"," No."
"2915500","2920180"," So now the answer right now on cycles is, fuck no to you. "
"2920420","2921960"," Fuck no, we're not done going down."
"2922960","2924480"," PPO, PMOs saying hell no."
"2926080","2929700"," And we're going to, I'm going to show you one last thing here in just a moment. "
"2929740","2930760"," I'm going to switch back over."
"2931600","2934180"," I want to show you one more thing here."
"2934900","2938220"," Go back to that Webull chart so you can, you can focus your attention on this. "
"2939180","2940280"," Hold on one second here."
"2944600","2947720"," No hiding all the stuff you've got."
"2948580","2951600"," Let me leave this up and I'll show you one more thing here. "
"2951720","2958040"," Here's S1 above your, your hourly triggers way up here."
"2958560","2960160"," Your daily triggers way up here."
"2962020","2964400"," There's your S3 to the downside right there. "
"2968290","2973290"," And look at these cycles and I'm like, oh man, this is, this looks like, like that's Sally"
"2973290","2974130"," yesterday, right?"
"2974510","2975710"," Was bad."
"2977050","2978490"," It was bad."
"2979410","2989510"," The next one I'm going to set up for you is the unemployment rates, the Feds Fund rate, the"
"2989510","2992290"," unemployment rate, inflation, rate of inflation, all that kind of stuff. "
"2992470","2993290"," We're going to talk about that next."
"2993970","2996170"," We're just going to give you one quick question or one quick moment here."
"2998050","2999430"," It'll load this bad boy up. "
"3001630","3002350"," Come on now."
"3012980","3013920"," Hold on a second here."
"3013960","3015660"," I'm going to problem trying to load these layouts. "
"3026160","3026900"," There we go."
"3033200","3034940"," Having a, having a moment here."
"3035460","3037860"," I'm going to issue here trying to get this to load up and I don't know why. "
"3043700","3046900"," We're going to go back to this."
"3047060","3049200"," We showed this earlier in the week."
"3050920","3052460"," So here's SPX right here. "
"3052540","3055740"," We're going to go to a weekly chart on SPX right here."
"3056840","3058080"," Try to clean this up."
"3066010","3067310"," Shouldn't be taken so long. "
"3067310","3068350"," We turned some of this stuff up."
"3068510","3081630"," Having some real issues past couple of days with my, having some real issues with, um, with"
"3081630","3083210"," my internet, which I shouldn't be having."
"3083370","3085310"," I've got, um, really good internet. "
"3089900","3091060"," There we go."
"3092300","3095220"," Let's take a look now at SPX."
"3097100","3102640"," Then we're going to discuss some of those charts that said chair was trying to push. "
"3107290","3112210"," You can see the fed funds rate peaking yesterday."
"3115430","3120890"," You can see the rate of inflation has jumped a little bit, but I do expect it to come down,"
"3121050","3123430"," but we're talking about 2024 here."
"3123970","3127130"," And this is really what I want to, where, really what I want to show you here is the unemployment"
"3127130","3129410"," rate and what he was talking about yesterday. "
"3130430","3133150"," And you can see the unemployment rate ramping up."
"3136430","3138890"," And, you know, we're talking about December."
"3143790","3145230"," Of 2024 here. "
"3145330","3146330"," Here's the employment rate."
"3147910","3153940"," And we're already at 3.8% here."
"3162440","3170840"," Talking about a peak of unemployment somewhere around 5% into end of next year in our current path"
"3170840","3171700"," right now. "
"3172220","3177280"," And let's talk about what 5% usually looks like."
"3178940","3184680"," It's right about here."
"3186840","3192380"," And you can see that nice role has already began before we ever got to that 5% right. "
"3192880","3195040"," Right here, they start time that role."
"3195660","3198240"," You see right where we are right here in this unemployment rate."
"3199820","3203560"," And so by the time we get there, the implication would be. "
"3204780","3208740"," That, you know, they're actually cutting rates in December, right?"
"3209360","3210240"," Crash has already commenced."
"3210580","3211240"," It's heading down."
"3212600","3215180"," And this is the year 2000 right here, right?"
"3215320","3217440"," 2000, 2003, right?"
"3218400","3222860"," And so they're telling you that they're going to keep raising rates, holding them higher in 2024. "
"3223820","3227680"," And what the, because he brought up the unemployment rate specifically yesterday."
"3228780","3230620"," And I was like, there's no way."
"3230780","3235500"," I was like, there's no way they're going to be raising rates as the market is rolling down and over"
"3235500","3236480"," for an entire year. "
"3236480","3241320"," If anything, they're going to be chasing and cutting rates long before we get there."
"3242020","3244120"," Here is the federal funds rate right here."
"3244120","3249780"," You can actually see as that unemployment ramps, you actually see that they make the cuts long"
"3249780","3252420"," before they ever get there and chase it all the way down. "
"3253720","3259080"," So you can see the 10s and 2s right here starting to take off and ramp north, all that kind"
"3259080","3260440"," of stuff already happening."
"3260700","3267500"," So when you're looking at things, when you have the Fed President coming out there yesterday and"
"3267500","3277760"," showing you, when you're the Fed President coming out there yesterday and showing you, playing"
"3277760","3293600"," tight one second here, when the Fed President coming out there yesterday and telling you, or"
"3293600","3297220"," when you look at the actual data, how should I re-describe this?"
"3297220","3310580"," When the Fed tells you to leave that up for you here, when"
"3310580","3321860"," the Fed comes out and tries to tell you they're going to be raising into December of 2024, it's"
"3321860","3330200"," kind of like being a child and being caught doing something wrong, which is fine, right?"
"3330520","3334180"," Your child needs to learn how to lie, believe it or not."
"3334740","3338200"," You may not know that, but kids have to learn how to negotiate through life. "
"3339080","3346160"," So you're trying to get them to, I don't know what is going on this morning."
"3348500","3349860"," Like 30-minute chart, no problem."
"3349860","3352220"," I'm going to chart fucking implode none itself. "
"3353300","3354060"," There we go."
"3358680","3366280"," So like a child that's like, you want a child to learn how to negotiate, a child needs to learn"
"3366280","3369820"," how to, you guys know that people lie all the time, right?"
"3370140","3374400"," They don't lie intentionally off a lot of times, but it's part of coping for humans."
"3375720","3386660"," It's like all he had to do yesterday, all he had to do yesterday is say, well,"
"3386820","3392540"," we're doing higher for longer, but I'm going to break out a bunch of shit and that you'd find on"
"3392540","3394820"," fin to it to explain it to you. "
"3396020","3401140"," It's kind of where you know something's, the gig is up, something is wrong, you know?"
"3402320","3403380"," Hold on a second here."
"3407870","3410430"," Having some internet issues again today."
"3412330","3416970"," You kind of know something's wrong when they have to go that far, right?"
"3417430","3421650"," It's kind of like a child telling you a lie or a fib or something like that, and then they"
"3421650","3422690"," go a little overboard. "
"3423590","3425410"," Like they go a little too dramatic."
"3426610","3430610"," They cover up with, you know, and you find it funny as an adult."
"3430690","3431890"," The parents, I find it funny. "
"3432070","3432950"," I'm like, oh, there they go."
"3433070","3434270"," They're just trying to lie to me right now."
"3434630","3435930"," And it gets a little absurd. "
"3436110","3441010"," And so I'll talk to my children and be like, yeah, that worked over there, but that definitely"
"3441010","3441450"," didn't work."
"3441610","3442630"," That didn't help your cause."
"3443890","3446650"," You know, I'm going to, we're going to dissect you lying to me. "
"3448170","3452870"," What would have worked and what definitely did not work with you lying to me?"
"3456070","3458770"," And Jorobe yesterday to me was like that child."
"3459530","3462090"," Like Jerome did not have to say the things that he said."
"3462130","3463890"," He did not have to bring those charts out. "
"3463890","3471090"," And when you're looking at the actual data, when you're looking at the actual data, honestly,"
"3471590","3474990"," you're like, I don't really, he can say higher for longer all he wants."
"3475830","3482750"," He's, he's likely going, he's likely is a high chance is a high probability that he's going to be"
"3482750","3485170"," cutting by spring or summer."
"3487050","3494450"," By spring or summer, there's a very good chance, like 60 to 70% chance that he's going to be"
"3494450","3495790"," cutting by that time period. "
"3495790","3496830"," That doesn't mean we're at a bottom."
"3497110","3501750"," Just means he'll be cutting and we'll be running down into some kind of bottom by middle of the"
"3501750","3503470"," year, by end of year next year."
"3504390","3504510"," Right. "
"3504910","3505790"," Something like that."
"3506190","3511430"," So there's probably a smart person at a bank and the fed and they're looking at each other"
"3511430","3513590"," yesterday and they're like, they're like, wait a minute."
"3513770","3514870"," Why are you telling people that?"
"3515750","3516570"," You get what I'm saying?"
"3517090","3521610"," And then there was the big fuck you to all the realtors of the United States yesterday. "
"3521610","3525230"," I can't even imagine if I was a realtor watching that yesterday."
"3525870","3527610"," What you're going to tell people, right?"
"3528290","3531270"," You have, if you're a realtor out there, you're fucked this morning, right?"
"3531730","3535390"," You just got told rates aren't coming down for the next year at minimum."
"3536390","3537630"," Supposedly at minimum. "
"3538690","3539650"," Data dependent."
"3542110","3545630"," And of course the data speaks volumes that."
"3548030","3556370"," If you can make a bet in Vegas, if the fed would still be hiking in December of 2024, I"
"3556370","3561370"," would take the bet against the fed actually hiking in 20 December of 2024. "
"3561950","3564150"," You're likely going to be ramping up at that point."
"3564330","3566490"," The market's going to be on fucking fire."
"3566990","3571750"," It's going to be the market's going to likely be running down the road with its head on fire. "
"3572530","3576790"," By the time we ever get to December 2024."
"3577490","3580390"," And my view, well, that's what the data suggests at least."
"3580930","3583810"," That's going to be happening long before we ever get to that point. "
"3584630","3587770"," And so it's almost like there's a reaction from."
"3588830","3590770"," It's almost like there's a reaction from."
"3591850","3595850"," From the bank saying, we're going to call you on that one, bro, right?"
"3596210","3597570"," We think you're wrong in this one. "
"3598010","3599970"," And we don't care what you're going to tell people."
"3599970","3602270"," And you can say whatever you want."
"3602450","3604290"," But between now and. "
"3605130","3608570"," That time period, you should expect a major fucking low in the stock market."
"3609410","3612290"," And you're, we'd like to revisit that with you."
"3612490","3613850"," I mean, they were showing dot plots yesterday. "
"3614170","3615870"," You know, dot plots are fucking useless, right?"
"3616350","3618010"," They don't mean a fucking thing."
"3623200","3625640"," Yeah, that's true."
"3625780","3626400"," Who just said that?"
"3626600","3634020"," Uncle JBJ said, my dad was a pro baseball coach, old saying he used to quote, you know, you're why"
"3634020","3634600"," you're wrong. "
"3634680","3638000"," And I know you're lying because you're arguing with him."
"3638520","3642320"," And dude, he did not have to do that yesterday."
"3642800","3645000"," He did not have to argue with people. "
"3645140","3649040"," He did not have like, how does the Fed chair say?"
"3650800","3653120"," How is the Fed chair not prepped for?"
"3653460","3655660"," If the government shuts down, where are you going to get to data?"
"3656100","3658780"," What the fuck can answer?"
"3658780","3664660"," What the fuck can answer is that from our own federal chair saying, I don't know where we're going"
"3664660","3665260"," to get the data."
"3665460","3666380"," I don't know what we're going to do."
"3666960","3668040"," Like, can you imagine that?"
"3668260","3669340"," Like, I can't imagine that. "
"3669380","3670020"," I can't imagine that."
"3670080","3670520"," I'm a CEO."
"3671380","3675100"," We're never higher fucking CEO that said some insane shit like that. "
"3675620","3677080"," You need some kind of an answer."
"3677860","3679480"," We've got people working on that right now."
"3680580","3685680"," We got someone working in the basement on that right now to get that data for you so that we"
"3685680","3686580"," can make a right decision. "
"3687580","3690320"," His response yesterday was, we don't know what we're going to do to get a right decision."
"3690900","3692340"," We don't know if we're going to have any data."
"3692880","3694540"," I'm like, we know you're going to have fucking data. "
"3694920","3697660"," I know you know you're going to have the data."
"3697900","3702200"," We're not going to have some kind of fucking crisis where you step up on a podium at the next"
"3702200","3702860"," rate decision."
"3703100","3707520"," If there is a shutdown and you're just going to say, oopsie, I don't have any data. "
"3708240","3709280"," I'll be back next rate decision."
"3709660","3710080"," See you later."
"3711120","3714020"," That's they're out of their fucking minds saying that yesterday. "
"3725330","3726850"," It does a right to strike in today."
"3727130","3727330"," I don't know."
"3727430","3728130"," There's people in this. "
"3728290","3731450"," We have a lot of directors and actors in this sub."
"3731610","3733070"," So they might be able to answer that question for you."
"3733810","3735730"," In our chat, we've got people that are in the industry. "
"3736150","3738750"," Now, I can call some people if you want to have some friends that are in the industry."
"3739510","3740670"," But I can check if you want."
"3740810","3741450"," What does that mean?"
"3741810","3744250"," If the strike is done. "
"3744490","3744790"," I don't know."
"3744870","3746390"," We can check out Netflix if you like."
"3748070","3749090"," Hold on one second. "
"3749210","3750030"," I'm going to buy a dipper thing."
"3750190","3750830"," Hold on."
"3762570","3763250"," I'm excited. "
"3763450","3764970"," I just got kicked out of my fucking account."
"3765010","3765890"," Hold on one second here."
"3791080","3793720"," So my point being here is that. "
"3795780","3796800"," There's likely."
"3798080","3804980"," There's likely some kind of a disconnect at the moment between what banks expect to happen and what"
"3804980","3809980"," the Fed is going to happen with that with that statement from Jerome Paul yesterday."
"3810220","3811680"," There's more than likely. "
"3812440","3816940"," If there was like a hey, we're here and you're here and we're going to chase you in front run"
"3816940","3817220"," this."
"3818420","3824700"," That chasm is grown from the public statement yesterday by Jerome Paul."
"3824980","3829560"," There's more than likely some kind of a disconnect here and what the Fed thinks they're going to"
"3829560","3829760"," do. "
"3830280","3837660"," And what the market in general thinks is going to happen between now and next December."
"3837660","3842940"," And the data disagrees with the Fed on what's going to happen."
"3843040","3848920"," We start cranking up to like four, five, six, seven, eight or an anticipation of those unemployment"
"3848920","3849500"," rates. "
"3850140","3855660"," You are going to see the market react negatively to that happening next year."
"3855860","3857360"," That's what I see happening next year."
"3857460","3859360"," I see those rates climbing. "
"3859780","3862760"," I see the yield curve inversion climbing."
"3863640","3867900"," Those will matter when we get into next year."
"3868180","3870860"," So it behooves you as an investor. "
"3871540","3877100"," And my point here is that it behooves you as an as an investor to likely."
"3878400","3883280"," Likely begin to no longer trust the Fed."
"3884580","3891260"," I would, I would no longer trust the Fed here between now and December of 2024. "
"3891800","3896080"," And their projections into 2024."
"3897460","3898720"," I'm not in a disagreement."
"3898920","3899820"," They don't raise rates. "
"3900260","3902640"," Another 50 BPS and a 25 and another 25."
"3903360","3908400"," I just don't think that we get to that point where we have low unemployment."
"3908900","3912760"," We've got, we've got the, we've got like the little bad quarter of GDP. "
"3913820","3914580"," Like it's so bizarre."
"3914980","3916800"," I couldn't get past that yesterday."
"3917740","3920600"," He seemed to reinforce the idea to me. "
"3921520","3924580"," That there's, there's bad things coming in 2024."
"3926080","3928500"," And normally we have bad things coming."
"3930800","3932820"," They will, they will cut rates. "
"3933120","3937980"," They will pause and they will cut rates unless maybe there's some kind of like."
"3938520","3944380"," Maybe there's some kind of esoteric change from the Fed where the modern monetary theory is going"
"3944380","3945100"," to be."
"3945100","3946900"," Shit can in the trash can. "
"3947280","3948720"," But I don't believe it."
"3949320","3953660"," I don't believe it because what comes after that is a depression."
"3954300","3956720"," If that's the actual case, right?"
"3957020","3958520"," Like, oh, we're not going to cut rates. "
"3959200","3963660"," We'll leave them up longer, even if all this bad negative data is coming out."
"3963940","3965640"," In December of 2024."
"3966540","3968340"," We're going to stay high even then. "
"3968340","3971180"," I can't, I can't wrap my head around."
"3972540","3975200"," Them saying modern monetary theory is dead."
"3975360","3976640"," They've made that claim before. "
"3977280","3978360"," They made it recently."
"3979280","3982940"," And they, and they were still injecting money into the system."
"3983400","3990520"," They were injecting money into hedge funds to buy this market in March, December and March. "
"3990760","3997300"," They were injecting cash into the banks to make loans to hedge funds to buy the market."
"3997300","3999820"," So I'm not a believer."
"4001040","4005980"," It's kind of like a, have you guys ever had so growing up, I grew up, you don't pick your"
"4005980","4006260"," friends. "
"4006980","4011520"," Had a couple friends that were, and one friend that was an opiate, opiate addict."
"4012560","4013900"," And another friend that was a heroin addict."
"4014940","4018140"," Not a friend, but a college roommate's brother was a heroin addict. "
"4019880","4021940"," Well, both those guys are dead today."
"4023080","4025480"," And both those guys, they died young too."
"4027280","4028740"," You couldn't trust those guys. "
"4029940","4033720"," And modern monetary theory is very similar to a heroin addiction."
"4034780","4035580"," You can't trust."
"4037100","4043640"," You can't, not only can you not trust the person that's using modern monetary theory, but if you"
"4043640","4046820"," remove it from them immediately, they're likely going to die. "
"4047200","4051740"," They're likely going to, I don't know if you know what it's called, like a withdrawal shock of some"
"4051740","4054260"," kind and they're likely going to fucking die if you remove it from them."
"4054260","4057860"," And our economy is very similar to that."
"4058040","4064660"," So when you hear them say things like, well, we're not going to do QE in any form, they're lying. "
"4064960","4071240"," If there's ever a moment at the bond auction where the Fed doesn't show up, right, this fucking,"
"4071560","4074160"," our whole system will crash to the depths of hell."
"4074240","4075340"," You guys realize that, right?"
"4076320","4079580"," Like the buyer of last resort is the fucking Fed."
"4079580","4084420"," And that is, you can slice it and dice whatever you want. "
"4084600","4085360"," That's still QE."
"4085680","4090980"," In my viewpoint, that is a form, quote unquote, a form of QE."
"4091580","4093280"," And so I don't buy it. "
"4093960","4100460"," I've been lied to too many times from the Fed since I was a kid as to what they're going"
"4100460","4100819"," to do."
"4101300","4103020"," This is going back to 1978."
"4103240","4104000"," Nothing has changed. "
"4104720","4109960"," They bought the dip on, they bought the dip when they were telling you in CNBC that they weren't"
"4109960","4110660"," going to buy the dip."
"4111319","4114140"," He had fat old white guys with greasy hands on CNBC."
"4114960","4116420"," I think it was Gerlach that said that. "
"4117260","4119520"," He said, four PE ratios are too high."
"4119819","4124180"," Meanwhile, they were fucking buying that Ford PE ratio on that trend going all the way up since"
"4124180","4125040"," 1978."
"4125540","4128979"," They were talking out of the one side of their mouth while they were doing something completely"
"4128979","4129680"," fucking different. "
"4130260","4133180"," So when you hear these guys talk out there, they're lying."
"4134580","4138220"," Or they're locking horns if they're not agreeing, right?"
"4138540","4139880"," So you just can't trust them."
"4140180","4142359"," You just, you can't trust what they're saying to you. "
"4142640","4145520"," And you don't know what they're fighting about in the background either."
"4145560","4152880"," And what I was left with yesterday, this is a parting piece on this is you've got two groups of"
"4152880","4159380"," people that are way, way, way, way far apart in their expectations of where this market is going to"
"4159380","4159600"," head."
"4159600","4164600"," And then in the next year into the end of 2024, I don't know who's going to be right. "
"4164800","4165540"," Maybe the Fed is right."
"4166020","4167359"," Maybe we bounce off for 30."
"4167500","4168140"," We keep heading higher. "
"4168220","4169279"," We crank out 40 and 100."
"4169300","4170340"," We hit 5,000."
"4171000","4173140"," We start trading 6,000 and all that kind of stuff. "
"4173840","4181300"," But that fed yesterday, that fed chair yesterday, what he said is cause for pause from you as a"
"4181300","4186500"," buyer as an as an investor is cause for concern."
"4187359","4191160"," And I need you to understand that it's cause for concern."
"4192300","4194600"," It's very dangerous what was said yesterday. "
"4195260","4197980"," I would be very wary of what was said yesterday."
"4198440","4204820"," And that would be even more wary of the banks blowing off what he had to say yesterday."
"4206200","4210100"," And attempting to actually front run that downside move. "
"4210860","4216900"," And continuing on with that downside move whether that downside move was triggered yesterday or if"
"4216900","4220820"," it still plays out into the spring, I would be going against the Fed."
"4221620","4225920"," The Fed's basically telling basically Jerome Powell is telling you yesterday that everything's"
"4226880","4228180"," going to be fucking hockey Dory, right?"
"4228640","4229780"," All these stuffs going to come up."
"4229780","4233020"," They're going to keep raising rates and they're not going to cut. "
"4233380","4238720"," And his history says otherwise history says that isn't what's going to happen."
"4239140","4245700"," They will be fucking cutting and chasing into the fall and in winter of 2024."
"4246740","4249180"," They're out of their fucking minds if they think that's what they're doing. "
"4255020","4255720"," I'm sorry."
"4255840","4256640"," That's just the truth."
"4257920","4258880"," Hold on a second here. "
"4258940","4260440"," I got to do a quick thing down here."
"4268750","4270190"," Hold on one second here."
"4271630","4273410"," Let me read what you guys have for comments here. "
"4273470","4274010"," Give me a quick second."
"4274010","4278290"," I'll see what you guys' take on yesterday was."
"4279610","4286290"," I am interested to see what you guys have to say because that threw me for a loop. "
"4286750","4289190"," I was beside myself."
"4292040","4293980"," I was like, what the fuck are these guys?"
"4295740","4296680"," Hold on a second here."
"4301060","4302360"," I was like, they're out of their minds. "
"4302820","4304020"," I was like, they're out of their fucking minds."
"4306420","4309100"," I was like, why are they fucking guys so fast?"
"4311000","4313240"," I'll see what you guys are saying in the chat real quick."
"4314420","4315740"," Hey, Chad, what's now you doing?"
"4318060","4324140"," Sad says, if there is a 2008 event and they have to show up housing, how can they justify at"
"4324140","4324560"," that point?"
"4325560","4330040"," You know, there's some other historical facts out there too. "
"4330280","4333500"," Like where we are right now in the stock market."
"4333500","4335180"," This is another tidbit for you."
"4336540","4345820"," We don't have many instances of not getting a new high after the previous high in 2022. "
"4345820","4348900"," So we came into the beginning of January of 2022."
"4349180","4351540"," We make this run higher right now."
"4352180","4358160"," There are not many examples of us not getting a new high, even if we sell. "
"4359100","4363720"," So when we do not make the new high, we fail to get that new high."
"4364940","4370560"," The end result is usually a major second leg down, major."
"4371500","4374240"," Second leg down, a vicious one to the downside. "
"4374800","4377080"," So it's very precarious."
"4377660","4381340"," Like where SPX is right now, the Fed meeting yesterday."
"4383620","4387340"," Triggers, not motions and thoughts of shit. "
"4388100","4391260"," You're like, this guy, this guy really does a way of fucking around fire right here."
"4391320","4394080"," He wants to get that new high and then maybe come out and do that kind of a speech."
"4394860","4399840"," Like I would expect, I would have expected that speech yesterday on a new high of the stock market. "
"4400240","4404320"," Like if we were like tracking a new high, we're coming in for a rate decision and he laid out"
"4404320","4404820"," that plan."
"4405400","4407760"," And they just started fucking front running his ass down."
"4407760","4414020"," So the timing of that meeting yesterday, I thought was inappropriate. "
"4414500","4418860"," I thought if we had hit like 4800 or something like that and he came out with that meeting, I"
"4418860","4419380"," wouldn't be shocked."
"4419620","4422280"," They'd be like, yeah, that sounds, it sounds about right what he's going to say."
"4423460","4426560"," And we're going to roll the fuck out of this on that meeting. "
"4426800","4428520"," But him doing it yesterday is a little bit early for me."
"4428580","4429820"," It's, it's concerning to me."
"4432440","4436900"," If there is a 2000 events and they have to show up housing, how can they justify at that point?"
"4438860","4440300"," I had a side. "
"4440500","4442540"," Now this isn't coming from me, but."
"4443280","4445480"," Yesterday I heard I had someone else."
"4445920","4448460"," So I talked to four people yesterday. "
"4449440","4450920"," One, two, three."
"4451400","4453520"," I talked to four people yesterday after the market closed."
"4454120","4457020"," And one of the things that was said to me about housing. "
"4458660","4465560"," Was that the banks would actually like that crisis because they've built so many new rental homes."
"4466180","4470620"," That it'd be, it'd be beneficial to like black rock and companies like that."
"4471080","4473920"," To have that housing crisis would create more renters. "
"4474920","4479580"," And then put more asses and seats inside of these rental homes that they're building."
"4480160","4485080"," I can't lend anything to that other than wild ass opinions."
"4492200","4496080"," Yeah, they would love the mother of all crisis is at this point wrap it all up roll out CBDCs. "
"4496740","4496860"," Yeah."
"4497100","4497200"," Yeah."
"4498060","4498960"," I've heard that argument too. "
"4503260","4504960"," I haven't looked at T and X the moment."
"4505840","4507080"," Let me see what else you guys got."
"4508400","4509920"," And I want to show you something else here too. "
"4510300","4512440"," There's some other two fascinating things I want to show you guys."
"4513100","4515300"," So let's let me show you two other cool things."
"4516700","4518760"," Now saying, saying everything I said, right?"
"4519000","4522320"," Getting all the bearishness out of me, all the fear out of me, all that kind of stuff. "
"4523320","4525360"," There are two other things to look at."
"4525780","4528960"," And I want to show you these for good reason."
"4529160","4530300"," I want to show you two other things. "
"4533670","4534950"," Two quick charts."
"4535250","4535970"," I want to show you here."
"4536530","4537450"," One quick second here. "
"4547100","4549100"," We're going to look at a H Y G."
"4550540","4553920"," And we're going to look at H Y G for a reason."
"4554100","4556980"," Sometimes people, I heard someone say, why does he look at H Y G."
"4558440","4560760"," On these momentum charts and."
"4564120","4565520"," There's good reason and. "
"4566600","4569280"," There's good reason to be looking at these invented charts for."
"4571460","4574580"," For the market and they do actually show."
"4575420","4576520"," What to expect. "
"4576520","4581240"," So we're going to go to a one day chart on H Y G."
"4582860","4584680"," These actually do match up."
"4586920","4589160"," So here's H Y G right now, right?"
"4590420","4593340"," This this tracks pretty much our market, right?"
"4594460","4595620"," You can see how H Y G is."
"4595880","4597740"," It's actually a leading indicator for SPX. "
"4600900","4602740"," And it doesn't it doesn't quite."
"4604640","4605980"," It doesn't quite a."
"4613270","4616670"," It doesn't quite or how do I explain this better?"
"4616870","4621090"," It's a leading indicator for SPX before what takes place in SPX."
"4621350","4622630"," But I'm saying that. "
"4624230","4627030"," When I'm looking for for roles in the marketplace."
"4628490","4631270"," One of the things I'm always looking at or for is."
"4632210","4634490"," Some kind of a roll down in the monthly. "
"4635370","4637990"," And monthly velocity."
"4638470","4640370"," So I want to direct your attention to."
"4641130","4642850"," Specifically this one right here. "
"4643870","4646330"," We came down and rolled underneath right here."
"4646890","4651270"," And you have this major role coming down right here and I want to direct your attention again to."
"4652090","4654250"," This monthly velocity bottoming. "
"4654770","4655630"," Down here."
"4656410","4662350"," And what's what's possible to grow to the downside down here on monthly velocity monthly velocity"
"4662350","4664210"," is bottoming right now."
"4664210","4665410"," But still weak. "
"4666090","4667270"," It's at minus 11."
"4667330","4668870"," I want to direct your attention to it."
"4669270","4670750"," We have a new low right now. "
"4670830","4673310"," We had a minus 67 right here."
"4674090","4676930"," We've got a minus 70 right here and minus 11."
"4677250","4677970"," It says right now. "
"4678010","4678910"," But it can go lower."
"4678910","4679850"," It can go to minus 25."
"4680490","4683470"," It can actually go to minus 50 on this little tag right here. "
"4684590","4686150"," And the weekly."
"4687550","4690690"," Here has a lower high just by a tick."
"4691530","4693330"," So we've got a high on weekly right here. "
"4693350","4695590"," We have a lower high right now right here."
"4696350","4698290"," Which is implying that the weekly."
"4699430","4703610"," Is actually creating a series of lower highs. "
"4704410","4707270"," To the downside and also beginning to show."
"4707790","4710190"," Some ramp to the downside here."
"4710350","4711610"," On the marketplace. "
"4712830","4718290"," This is H Y G F H Y G begins to get bearish, but this there's actually a bull case."
"4718290","4720430"," In this chart right now."
"4721270","4723710"," And this is looking pre. "
"4724390","4725470"," This looks like October."
"4726970","4728830"," To March on spy."
"4730230","4732230"," And why is it important. "
"4734290","4736770"," For a bull in particular."
"4738090","4742230"," I want to show you why right now why there's going to be anger."
"4743010","4744990"," From bears why. "
"4746690","4749330"," This is the positive part of the program for you."
"4749490","4752190"," So if you're a bull, this is your time to say."
"4752790","4753690"," Captain, you're wrong. "
"4753810","4755130"," We're going to bounce off for 30."
"4755990","4758270"," Captain, this market's just getting started."
"4759390","4762230"," This is your this is your piece to resist us. "
"4762630","4768890"," I want you to focus here on this yellow line."
"4772980","4775840"," I want you to see this yellow line right here, right."
"4776500","4783040"," In this yellow line when it's below the blue line is bearish, extremely bearish. "
"4783760","4789220"," When this yellow line breaks above the blue line, it becomes actually bullish, not bearish."
"4791000","4796540"," You also have a cross of the weekly trigger, which is what's considered the emotional trigger,"
"4796960","4797100"," right."
"4797760","4801600"," This is major trend here and major trend is saying we're going up, right. "
"4802540","4805320"," Even though we're blasting down here, prices down here right now."
"4806040","4809240"," Trend is up and trend is over the monthly trigger."
"4810000","4813900"," When price and daily is below monthly, it's extremely bearish. "
"4814360","4818660"," When price breaks above the monthly trigger, it's bullish."
"4819940","4826580"," And the emotional trigger, the orange one down here, this one is the emotional side of the market."
"4826860","4830960"," So this is where everyone gets emotional, right. "
"4831120","4833220"," When price is above it, we're happy."
"4833220","4836800"," When price is below it, we're very scared and panicky, right."
"4837540","4839600"," But that's crossing the monthly trigger too. "
"4840820","4847680"," So when you're looking at this stuff, when you're looking at like HYG, HYG right now is telling you"
"4847680","4849180"," do not worry."
"4850060","4858180"," HYG is saying we have a lot of volatility and emotions here, but we're beginning to break away from"
"4858180","4858880"," that volatility."
"4859620","4860900"," We're actually getting positive. "
"4860900","4872040"," So even though we may have a day or two or three where we're blasting down on HYG, if"
"4872040","4883880"," that HYG does get bought, let's say at 7370 or 7340, if it is bought down there, right."
"4883980","4887900"," It's going to just confirm that the leg is actually higher."
"4888260","4889840"," This is where you get the Tom Lee's. "
"4892160","4897320"," This whole thing right here is where you get the Tom Lee's saying, hey, we're going to 4,800."
"4898680","4901280"," Not only we're going to 4,800, we're going to 5,000."
"4904560","4907900"," We're going to go to 5,000, we're going to go to 4,800, we're going to go to 5 "
"4907900","4913360",",000, we're going to go to 6,000, and we're actually in the start of a new bull regime. "
"4915920","4921500"," This is one of the reasons these guys are saying we're going to these new highs."
"4922500","4924680"," They have a point to be made here."
"4926400","4928300"," They have a point to be made here. "
"4928540","4936260"," We're going to compare this to SPX, and we're going to compare this to previous examples of this"
"4936260","4936640"," happening."
"4938080","4942140"," So this is the bottom, right?"
"4942580","4945360"," We get the day cross to the upside on the yellow line."
"4945480","4949280"," We get the orange cross to the upside on the yellow line. "
"4949280","4959040"," I remember when we came back down and tested this channel right here on SPY, and I remember bears"
"4959040","4965340"," lost millions on that bounce right there as we shot up higher."
"4965620","4966140"," I mean millions."
"4966540","4971400"," I had friends lose millions of dollars because they said, nope, that's where the next role is. "
"4971700","4972160"," We're going down."
"4972300","4973580"," We're going to roll this a second time."
"4974040","4975740"," There's a previous example of this. "
"4977000","4978060"," Here's another one."
"4978480","4981040"," You get the cross on HYG, prices above."
"4981840","4986500"," You come back down, you violently check, violent check, and then off and running to the upside. "
"4987580","4993260"," So HYG, this is all kinds of examples of this in prior history."
"4993960","4998220"," When we have the yellow and the orange line break, and then we finally break above right here."
"4999140","5003340"," Slam back down, even another slam back down over here, and we continue higher. "
"5003340","5012640"," So HYG right now is in disagreements with all of the damage to the market."
"5013780","5016460"," Now I will say this about HYG."
"5017260","5019000"," Get your pens and papers out again. "
"5021740","5028200"," You do not want to see HYG with closing bars underneath $73."
"5029100","5034220"," You could leave it at a flat 70, but truly it's not 70 bucks."
"5034220","5037040"," You start closing below $73. "
"5038040","5041980"," You start closing below this $69.13 down here."
"5043340","5045620"," And things are going to get ugly for bulls."
"5046440","5049120"," So bulls, you can't be trading down here, right?"
"5049920","5055800"," You need to be holding roughly where we are roughly somewhere in here. "
"5056960","5060400"," And stay on trend to the upside on HYG."
"5060400","5067000"," If you're watching the market, I need you to know that $73 is what you need to hold right in"
"5067000","5067880"," that zone."
"5068240","5072920"," You need to hold that $73 to the upside for that new bull market. "
"5073560","5076720"," I want to show you how violent this gets on SPX really quick."
"5077700","5084760"," When you see those major crosses, you're going to see emotions run high."
"5084760","5091600"," And I want to draw your attention to this part of SPX. "
"5093100","5100060"," So if this is right now, you know, HYG is trying to make its way above here, right?"
"5100700","5104920"," And then you've got that boom retest down below off and running to the upside."
"5106300","5111240"," Right there, you know that we're now into a normalized market."
"5111240","5117320"," You guys will recall that we actually made videos. "
"5118560","5126940"," And we said to you in those videos, once price, the daily, the weekly, and the monthly are in line,"
"5127580","5129540"," we have a normalized market."
"5130280","5132240"," We have a normalization of markets."
"5132500","5136080"," We continue higher and we have low vol in the marketplace. "
"5136080","5142980"," And you should have a stabilized market that continues to go higher unless these conditions right"
"5142980","5149960"," here change price daily weekly monthly price daily weekly and monthly."
"5150440","5152620"," And so, HYG is telling you."
"5154240","5157020"," HYG is telling you, I don't be worried about this. "
"5159580","5163040"," HYG is going to get bought and we're going to keep racing to the upside."
"5163040","5169740"," So if you are a bull, pay close attention to HYG."
"5171000","5179940"," Another fascinating ticket to pay attention to on momentum right now is"
"5179940","5181600"," VIX. "
"5184880","5187800"," And what makes VIX fascinating right here?"
"5189120","5198060"," So when you guys hear me say things like kill the VIX,"
"5198360","5203520"," time to murder the VIX, time to take the VIX down to the lows."
"5204280","5205780"," I want you to see this right here, right?"
"5206140","5211540"," You get the cross of the blue over the purple, the yellow and all that kind of stuff, right?"
"5212260","5215840"," We have new crazy, crazy lows, right?"
"5216860","5218320"," Let's see what's happening right here."
"5219900","5221100"," Let's start right here. "
"5221200","5228340"," We got the monthly crossing, the quarterly, the yearly and the six month right here."
"5228500","5231740"," So you got the blue over the purple, the gray and the light gray."
"5232740","5235420"," And we're kind of there right now, aren't we?"
"5236280","5238320"," Kind of there right now. "
"5238880","5239940"," You got to see that back there."
"5240080","5245480"," You see the blue crossing over and you're seeing major lows on VIX."
"5245480","5247080"," Ten dollars, right?"
"5247380","5249420"," Examples of ten dollars of that happening. "
"5249720","5251980"," Here's another one example right here."
"5252560","5259140"," This is 2007 VIX at eight dollars in December of 2006, right?"
"5259480","5261740"," Just cranking down on the VIX."
"5263120","5266620"," And we have that same situation happening here. "
"5268240","5269120"," Even if."
"5269120","5274000"," Let's get a little bit closer and check the Vicks out here."
"5276640","5278120"," Did you see that right there?"
"5278260","5279140"," You get the Vicks coming up. "
"5279620","5281080"," Come back down."
"5281340","5282340"," Bounces on the daily trigger."
"5282880","5286720"," Got a good, nice, clean bounce on 1451 and to start blasting up, right?"
"5287920","5297000"," You've got a target above of $18.83, 1939 and 2069 here. "
"5298300","5306280"," And then you've got an eventual blast off above here to $27.27. But even saying that stuff, if we"
"5306280","5311460"," can get a rejection here and you're a bull, you're going to be looking for new lows down here."
"5311520","5316540"," Probably not $2 or $4, but you are going to be looking for a new low down here of like"
"5316540","5317540"," $8."
"5319300","5324400"," $8, whatever you're hearing me say, say the second Vicks apocalypse is coming. "
"5325140","5330100"," That this is my intent right here is that you've got all this bearishness on Vicks."
"5330840","5338860"," And even if we get the squeeze up, the ultimate destination of it, the ultimate destination of it"
"5338860","5343660"," into December is another Vicks apocalypse down here, right?"
"5343860","5346200"," See that down there on the nice Vicks apocalypse in the end of the year."
"5346860","5349420"," So pay attention to the Vicks as well. "
"5351000","5357780"," If the Vicks can reject off $27 to the upside, if we get a nice bloody, nice, maybe one more"
"5357780","5359820"," nice bloody move to the downs and hit that 430."
"5360960","5363920"," Hopefully we don't roll the market over and down off."
"5364400","5368360"," If you see us go lower than 430, so this is a 420 target. "
"5370100","5377320"," This is your 430 target on the Vicks 430, 440 up here."
"5377320","5385060"," And even if you don't get that 420, and we just hit the 430 and head down, we should hit"
"5385060","5389000"," that $8 and $10 by end of the year if 430 gets bought."
"5389980","5392520"," See that $8 or $10 on the Vicks. "
"5393180","5399940"," So HYG, pay attention to HYG, pay attention to the Vicks in the coming weeks."
"5399940","5404500"," Pay attention to PPO, PMOs, is this a downside?"
"5405120","5412480"," Is this the bottom, I guess, would be the question, most more than likely not, 430, 432 on tap?"
"5414360","5419720"," And can the bulls hold that 430 would be the next question?"
"5420100","5421820"," Can they get above the 27 EMA?"
"5422780","5428140"," Can they get above the 27 EMA on the daily chart?"
"5429280","5431640"," So we're going to pay close attention."
"5432440","5441620"," We're going to pay close attention to that 27 EMA over the coming weeks with spoos. "
"5441740","5446760"," And it does beg the question to you and to myself."
"5447620","5456160"," It does beg the question of, is that just another moment to sell that 27 EMA"
"5456160","5458120"," on a daily basis?"
"5458120","5458600"," A daily chart."
"5459280","5465120"," So if you're a bull or even a seller, price started to the downside for $30. "
"5466200","5476120"," And right now it's the seller owns selling that 27 EMA on a daily chart for"
"5476120","5477980"," that big roll down."
"5478520","5479840"," That's your sell point."
"5480480","5485780"," So if you're like, hey, I want to sell, you sell that every time price comes into that 27 EMA"
"5485780","5488800"," in the daily chart, you're selling that 27 EMA. "
"5489140","5495380"," And that's the stance that I'm going to take at this point as well as selling that 27 EMA unless"
"5495380","5499180"," price breaks above and starts to back test it and head higher."
"5499800","5508800"," My view here is very fucking bearish, very fucking bearish due to what was said yesterday."
"5510320","5512400"," Dude, what the fuck is going on here?"
"5512400","5513680"," Give me one quick second here. "
"5515480","5516460"," Give me one quick second."
"5516560","5517520"," I got some weirdness going on."
"5523380","5529800"," Give me one quick second here in the back. "
"5529940","5530980"," I got some walking that's going on."
"5545260","5547400"," Dude, I don't know what is going on."
"5549080","5558560"," I have an internet problems pass today. "
"5558620","5562700"," I probably should go back down and reset my router and all that shit."
"5592090","5595610"," You guys can see all that."
"5596990","5598510"," There's the early trigger for you. "
"5604110","5605150"," Yeah, HYG."
"5605670","5614190"," I mean, if you have a, if you're a bull, that's what's saving you is the bond market."
"5616030","5622690"," High yield, I mean, like do like high risk crap shit bond market of all things is the. "
"5623570","5626250"," That is the risk on indicator for the stock market."
"5626570","5631070"," One of them is a couple others, but if you're a cash market equities trainer."
"5632170","5635570"," If there's any like light at the end of the tunnel for you. "
"5637410","5638370"," It's HYG."
"5638650","5643270"," HYG is telling a different story than everyone."
"5643490","5645630"," Not everyone else, but what the market is telling. "
"5646290","5647850"," The market is telling you."
"5648930","5650230"," The market's telling me."
"5652630","5657970"," You know, you guys are saying, or someone said, all week long, everyone says, you know, all week"
"5657970","5660770"," long, everyone's like, oh, this is the weakest time of the year. "
"5661830","5663810"," In September, this week specifically."
"5664350","5669430"," And then I think a spot camera said something last night again, parroting that parroting that."
"5670050","5675910"," That thesis, but you know, if this is the worst week in September, guess when the best time to buy"
"5675910","5676410"," is. "
"5676670","5678970"," So we're going to talk about seasonality and stuff like that."
"5679530","5681650"," You guys, you guys know the best time is to buy."
"5681990","5683110"," It's usually April. "
"5683610","5687870"," You usually get a major low in February, and then you get a, you get a place to buy the"
"5687870","5690950"," market in April, usually in like, start at April somewhere in there."
"5691830","5693230"," So let me ask you the next question."
"5693530","5697710"," If this is the seasonally, the worst, if this is the worst 10 days of the year or the worst"
"5697710","5700210"," 10 days of September, where the fuck it is you want to say?"
"5701610","5705290"," So when should I buy the market with a quarter million dollars?"
"5706610","5713270"," Should it be today or like in the end of September or should it be in February or April?"
"5713770","5716450"," From my experience, it's normally in April. "
"5717290","5721510"," March maybe, sometimes February has a really nasty low."
"5721910","5723810"," Come back down and recheck it again in April."
"5724250","5726110"," So if this is bad, what do you expect?"
"5726370","5731530"," I want to know now from you, what do you expect March and April to be or February and April"
"5731530","5733550"," to be if that's the case. "
"5734210","5739830"," So I think, I think that's the, that's where I got, that's where I've got the fly in the ointment"
"5739830","5740290"," for myself."
"5745140","5747140"," Yeah, and you got no money coming in the market either."
"5747140","5748140"," Let's, let's say it. "
"5748220","5749000"," Well, that's another thing."
"5749120","5750340"," So I talked to Pinky last night."
"5750480","5755220"," He's one of the guys I talked to and he made two very valid points to me, which I agree"
"5755220","5755500"," with. "
"5755500","5759260"," He was like, look, he's like, there's no money coming into the market."
"5760220","5766980"," There's no money coming in the market for until the, until the new month starts and I go, yeah, and"
"5766980","5767700"," it's end of quarter."
"5768660","5773520"," So you've got no new money coming into the markets until the quarter begins. "
"5774080","5776980"," So you got Q, Q for coming out, right?"
"5777540","5781420"," You're not going to see new money coming into the market in the end of September."
"5781420","5786440"," We're in the last week, two weeks of September and you get this shit news yesterday."
"5787120","5795140"," If you were trying to expel money or put money in this market, you'd be out of your fucking mind"
"5795140","5799360"," to do that without having the next, at least the next caller come out, right?"
"5800460","5801460"," Be out of your mind. "
"5801980","5803040"," You don't buy a dip here."
"5803480","5806380"," You can buy a dip with like five grand or a grand or something."
"5807040","5812440"," But you're not, you're not buying the market until the caller comes out at minimum, right?"
"5812860","5815240"," There are hedge funds that follow that shit. "
"5815480","5820720"," Like there are legitimate hedge funds that are like, we're going to follow JPMs doing this quarter."
"5820840","5826620"," So I'm going to assume here that's new major money."
"5827400","5833380"," If I was a sideline money person, would I be coming in today to buy the market?"
"5833780","5834260"," No. "
"5835140","5841600"," Could you be waiting until the first week or two of Q for possibly to expend money into the market?"
"5841880","5842120"," Maybe."
"5842760","5844420"," How far away is that right now?"
"5844560","5849800"," That's what, 20, 20 sessions away, 10, 15, 20 sessions away."
"5850080","5856000"," So just to that, just that question of new money coming out or when new money enters the market,"
"5856000","5857200"," this probably isn't it. "
"5857560","5861440"," It's probably isn't the moment that you'd expect that money to enter right now."
"5864760","5866480"," So yeah, and I got to do the Twitch thing."
"5866580","5867260"," Hold on one second here. "
"5867880","5868820"," Thanks for your minding me here."
"5868920","5873280"," I turned off subscriber only I think yesterday."
"5874740","5876300"," Think tight one quick second here. "
"5878700","5884760"," That settings subscriber only chat."
"5886940","5888100"," Thanks for saying something."
"5896030","5896870"," Yeah, you can. "
"5897190","5901670"," So I have, I don't talk much about this."
"5902150","5903810"," I own part of the stock market."
"5904430","5911250"," I have, I'm trying to buy the S&P 500 permanently with some money that I have. "
"5913890","5919510"," And I don't feel any confidence to buy the S&P 500."
"5920890","5921970"," I've got no confidence."
"5922830","5926350"," And what sealed that deal for me was Jerome yesterday. "
"5926850","5933850"," So I'm likely going to wait until probably April of next year."
"5934770","5935670"," At best."
"5936350","5938890"," And from what Jerome said yesterday. "
"5938890","5941910"," It really made me."
"5942690","5944230"," It really made me."
"5946510","5948050"," Kind of fucking pissed. "
"5949450","5949990"," Because."
"5951230","5955950"," My, my, my original idea was, well, if we get, my original idea was if we get above."
"5956650","5961190"," Like if we start heading higher, like last week or this week, you pull out of this get above"
"5961190","5966670"," twenty, seventy and a game on to squeeze out the last like four, seventy, two, four, eighty. "
"5967330","5969950"," I'm willing to like, I'm willing to like build a distance on that."
"5972510","5973230"," And yesterday."
"5977070","5978090"," I'm like, man. "
"5979590","5982810"," I might not be able to get to buy the fucking market with that money until."
"5984590","5985890"," December of twenty four."
"5990350","5994330"," Like, like, like, I'm gonna have to fucking, like, what am I going to do now?"
"5994330","5994750"," I'm paranoid. "
"5995170","5996670"," Like, what do I do with money?"
"5997570","6001330"," If I can't put it in the market until December of twenty four, what am I going to do with"
"6001330","6001650"," that money?"
"6002610","6004210"," And I don't know what I'm going to do."
"6004570","6005930"," I'm lost right now."
"6006290","6008710"," I was left, talked to my wife last night about it. "
"6009250","6010270"," I don't know what to do."
"6012070","6018350"," So, um, terms of risk coming into the market or if this risk that's coming, we had a lot of"
"6018350","6021470"," rotation in this market past few weeks into the market, believe it or not."
"6021470","6023930"," I had a ton of rotation, a ton of money already finished market. "
"6024350","6025850"," I don't even know what those people are thinking."
"6026150","6028750"," I don't, I'm wondering what they're thinking right now."
"6028790","6032550"," I'm wondering if there, I'm wondering if there's like a, a fund manager right now. "
"6032570","6034970"," It's like, I just bought a fuck out of envy and VDA."
"6034970","6038190"," And I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do if this thing blows to the downside."
"6038590","6039230"," What am I going to do here?"
"6039790","6040470"," Do I rebid?"
"6040590","6043410"," I had another few fucking two million, another five million, two or something. "
"6044350","6045450"," And I don't have a ton of money."
"6045510","6048070"," I mean, I got like some money, but I don't have millions."
"6049710","6051630"," To be DC and to this. "
"6051910","6051970"," So."
"6054270","6055410"," For me, at least."
"6056950","6059010"," I was thinking springtime. "
"6059590","6061570"," I probably get a good springtime."
"6061750","6062890"," Maybe late winter, get a good dip."
"6063510","6064730"," Nice fatty, but. "
"6066350","6069250"," It could be like December of 2024."
"6072150","6075490"," Against what that against what that Jerome was saying yesterday."
"6081510","6083130"," I think we discussed. "
"6083490","6084230"," Estau yesterday."
"6084590","6087070"," And I want to say something to that point this morning."
"6087950","6091250"," When I woke up this morning, I did a heat map check. "
"6091770","6093890"," And the Dow was bought."
"6095210","6096730"," Disney was bought yesterday."
"6097030","6100330"," There was some big rotation yesterday into Dow Jones industrial average. "
"6100330","6101470"," I was a little impressed with that."
"6102450","6104430"," I noticed that rotation yesterday."
"6104430","6106730"," I'd actually we talked about that with pinky yesterday. "
"6107430","6111290"," There was some rotation into some of those Dow companies."
"6112110","6113270"," Did anyone notice that?"
"6113470","6113650"," Let me see."
"6113750","6114770"," I bring up a heat map real quick. "
"6115850","6116450"," Pink tide."
"6116570","6117270"," Let me show you a heat map."
"6121070","6122970"," I mean, one quick second here. "
"6123030","6123790"," I'll bring up a heat map."
"6127650","6128210"," Right here."
"6128370","6128630"," Heat map. "
"6132290","6134410"," That's not quite showing it this morning, but."
"6135570","6136930"," This map sucks."
"6137290","6138930"," The one from yesterday was much better. "
"6140230","6143210"," But it did show a lot of companies in the Dow being bought."
"6143350","6143850"," As a matter of fact."
"6146210","6147990"," Like I own some of these companies. "
"6148630","6149990"," So I own like."
"6150590","6151550"," I own Verizon."
"6152030","6154270"," I own ATT own Tyson foods. "
"6155930","6158110"," I own a bunch of like dog shit with that dog shit."
"6158250","6160030"," But companies I want to own for like three or five years."
"6161110","6162790"," All those companies were holding up. "
"6163630","6166930"," Yes, holding up yesterday and looking like they wanted to go up yesterday."
"6167770","6170750"," That's why I kept talking about Disney yesterday, as I was."
"6170850","6172690"," I wanted to see like the Disney get. "
"6173190","6174470"," Fucking annihilated."
"6175330","6177870"," Or did it kind of like hold itself up and."
"6179110","6180350"," So, so Dow. "
"6180470","6182230"," So one thing on S Dow is."
"6183150","6185850"," You need the Dow Jones to participate."
"6186910","6189670"," In that move the second thing with Dow Jones industrial average. "
"6189670","6193570"," I talked yesterday about S Dow was to put some time on that trade."
"6194370","6194850"," Right."
"6194990","6195870"," Put some time in that trade. "
"6196750","6200830"," And then the second thing about the S Dow is make sure in with other people."
"6201330","6202530"," So make sure that you've got."
"6202770","6206150"," You're not just buying like a contract on S Dow and you're the only person buying it. "
"6206330","6209370"," You can actually see where the concentration of option interest is."
"6209730","6212610"," You're entering with them and exiting with them."
"6212610","6214510"," So let's look at Dow Dow. "
"6214910","6217150"," Let's look at S Dow really quick as a group."
"6218610","6220490"," We'll take a quick peek at S Dow here."
"6223380","6225360"," Where do I like to buy S Dow?"
"6230760","6232960"," Oh, look at that bad boy right there. "
"6233060","6233900"," I can't believe that."
"6234180","6235060"," It's fucking came."
"6235220","6236380"," I'm showing this guy right now. "
"6237180","6238620"," So here's S Dow."
"6242720","6245020"," And look at look at S Dow over here."
"6245100","6246680"," It's cranking right now, right?"
"6247660","6250600"," There's S Dow had a nice little sexy bottom down here. "
"6251380","6257060"," Right came up here and it's confirming the move higher, right?"
"6260620","6263080"," It's got two points of resistance on it."
"6263400","6264500"," The first one."
"6268740","6270800"," First point of resistance on S Dow. "
"6271020","6273200"," We are at right now, so they're not going to pay this right."
"6274600","6277080"," You need S Dow now to go higher."
"6277980","6283000"," And trade that $24.98 and come back down and continue higher. "
"6283300","6288440"," So if you're going to put some S Dow calls on something in the money I usually like with a"
"6288440","6291000"," lot of interest on it with some time on it."
"6291160","6295040"," So in the money, what is this?"
"6295280","6296020"," When is this right here?"
"6298420","6299380"," October 10th."
"6299680","6307460"," So like a November or December in the money call option seems appropriate and to further that"
"6307460","6309720"," point, where do you enter S Dow?"
"6311020","6312480"," You can see it right here, right?"
"6314200","6315220"," Fairly easy, right?"
"6316380","6317100"," Not too hard. "
"6319140","6320100"," Somewhere down there."
"6320260","6324420"," So if you wanted to re-enter S Dow, you know, pull back right here."
"6325460","6327880"," And then another one right there to get that second high. "
"6329260","6333100"," I always like to buy it like down here and then hold it for a period of time."
"6333720","6336240"," There's one example, two example, three example."
"6337080","6341680"," So if you maybe set an alert at home, if you want to buy S Dow, about this will draw"
"6341680","6342280"," a line together. "
"6343640","6346340"," And I'll show you how to set an alert on this."
"6346640","6347980"," So right up in here, right?"
"6349600","6351200"," And you just set an alert right here."
"6352360","6353100"," Create an alert. "
"6354180","6355200"," Oh, hold on."
"6355300","6356460"," That's not my number any longer."
"6356660","6357540"," So that doesn't matter. "
"6357700","6358640"," I turned that phone off."
"6360500","6361420"," But right down in there."
"6363580","6363980"," Right. "
"6364540","6365100"," Squeeze up."
"6365640","6366260"," Get another one."
"6366340","6367340"," Another dip by down there. "
"6367780","6369580"," And just keep buying that line right there."
"6369680","6369840"," Okay."
"6370380","6371340"," So this one right here. "
"6372080","6375980"," You want some S Dow protection, some pro galactic at any points."
"6376180","6377600"," That's where your dip by is."
"6377600","6379160"," You get an alert, sends it to your phone. "
"6379240","6379860"," There's another one."
"6380360","6381180"," There's another one."
"6381300","6384380"," And we talked about S Dow the other day, right?"
"6384580","6384980"," We talked about. "
"6385140","6386160"," Oh, we talked about put back spreads."
"6387220","6389440"," And then S Dow, one of my favorite things."
"6389440","6391220"," You just got to hold them right now, don't you?"
"6391220","6395660"," If you're already in that style right now, if you just bought them at the last possible moment in"
"6395660","6399340"," that style, you're you're kind of tied in here until you get a print. "
"6410210","6411450"," Ready for S Dow."
"6412630","6413290"," In the money."
"6414590","6417750"," With a high on the option. "
"6418570","6422630"," I keep the option chain open when I'm looking to enter, right?"
"6422870","6423250"," You put it."
"6423350","6425810"," You put an alert on set alert on a straight line."
"6425810","6431150"," And then whenever we hit that line, you go into the options chain and you see if anybody has bought"
"6431150","6435010"," something close in the money with time on it. "
"6435010","6437450"," You check through each option chain and look for concentrations."
"6437870","6442330"," If you've never had any experience trading S Dow, I do recommend that you trade it."
"6442690","6448870"," Paper trade it or just watch it closely for a month or two and you'll see the money coming in"
"6448870","6452570"," and out of that option chain clear as day. "
"6453550","6456490"," Whereas if you look at a spy chain, it's crowded, right?"
"6457090","6467010"," If you look at an S Dow options chain, it's either dead or it's filled with buyers with buyers"
"6467010","6470110"," and it's like concentrated on specific strikes."
"6472800","6474740"," No, I don't buy tips."
"6475200","6475680"," I do not. "
"6480190","6482470"," Yeah, there's five percent, dude."
"6483290","6486270"," So I'm not a."
"6487330","6488310"," I'm more."
"6490610","6498710"," More turned off by yesterday than I have been at all to risk and risk in the marketplace right now. "
"6501250","6505830"," I'm the most turned off I've been in some time here."
"6507590","6513430"," By the market in general by what took place yesterday was most definitely."
"6516680","6518660"," So we get a five minute chart here really quick. "
"6519580","6522780"," Make sure I got some tags done right down side here."
"6526080","6527960"," We're all good right down there."
"6528080","6528620"," That's all good. "
"6533860","6543640"," This is probably the most probably one of the worst fed appearances I've seen in a substantial"
"6543640","6545100"," amount of time."
"6545400","6549400"," That's probably one of the worst ones I've seen in it's not worse."
"6549620","6555740"," It's one of the ones where you think are they trying to be activists?"
"6555740","6560920"," Are they going to try to become an activist fed?"
"6561160","6561380"," Are they?"
"6566790","6568610"," I don't think that they're an activist fed. "
"6568870","6570110"," I don't like that thesis."
"6570510","6577210"," I know that I've heard that like maybe the feds being activist and I don't see how they can be."
"6577230","6578770"," I think I think it was bizarre. "
"6579610","6581390"," It was inappropriate what he did yesterday."
"6582910","6584510"," Saying the things that he said yesterday."
"6584830","6586290"," I thought that was out of line for him. "
"6586950","6589870"," And then just it's not his job to be looking at charts."
"6590930","6594930"," You leave that shit to someone to tell their underlings or something."
"6595610","6601470"," You can leave that shit to like a little fed chair, a small president or one of the underlings. "
"6602990","6610350"," You have an underling write a paper with a chart posted to Nick Temeros or something."
"6610350","6611930"," Something like that."
"6612510","6620250"," But you don't go out on fucking a national stage and try to defend the fucking dot plot. "
"6620550","6622010"," I'm like you're out of your fucking skull bro."
"6622250","6624850"," Just try to defend PCE on a chart."
"6625710","6627310"," What can we try to do?"
"6630610","6637450"," That's like me sailing my boat and having a fucking mate or a navigator second guess my decision"
"6637450","6644230"," and me stopping what I'm doing to walk over and explain to a fucking navigator why we're doing what"
"6644230","6644650"," we're doing. "
"6645310","6645930"," You know what I'm saying?"
"6646290","6648510"," It's not that the navigator doesn't know what they're talking about."
"6649410","6652250"," The fucking navigator is going to present chart not me."
"6652510","6653050"," Does that make sense?"
"6653310","6659830"," When the captain walks over to a fucking passenger and says I'm going to explain to you why I'm"
"6659830","6660530"," doing this shit. "
"6660990","6662910"," Something is wrong in the fucking hen house."
"6670330","6671330"," Something is wrong."
"6675210","6679850"," The fucking captain either doesn't know what the fuck he's doing or you guys don't believe the"
"6679850","6680910"," captain anymore right?"
"6681690","6682190"," Make sense?"
"6684450","6690150"," If you're ever in a boat and the captain comes to you and tries to explain things to you with"
"6690150","6694530"," a bunch of charts or a diagram to an engine or something like that. "
"6695460","6696870"," Something is wrong right?"
"6697390","6705410"," Or you've lost your faith in that captain to fix your engine or fix your sail plan or fucking"
"6705410","6708690"," doesn't know where they are or doesn't know what's coming."
"6709610","6711910"," That's when you should get scared."
"6712550","6713210"," That's"
"6713210","6724510"," when"
"6724510","6724510"," you get scared. "
"6725010","6729670"," Like I'll send a navigator off and be like, hey, man, go over like my wife's my navigator."
"6729690","6733450"," I'm like, you go tell the kids or talk to the kids or teach the kids this or whatever it"
"6733450","6733630"," is."
"6733690","6734070"," That's fine. "
"6735370","6742030"," Yeah, he looked really good last time."
"6742270","6743550"," His last meeting."
"6744750","6748270"," I didn't think he could thread the needle in the last meeting and he did. "
"6748330","6749050"," He did a great job."
"6749210","6750610"," I was like, fuck me."
"6750750","6751650"," He did it. "
"6751650","6754630"," I think I made that comment on stream."
"6754910","6760810"," I was like, whoever did this guy speech today, whatever dry runs they went through."
"6761570","6766670"," If they had like a room full of people watching to say yes or no, I was like, that was"
"6766670","6767070"," great. "
"6768190","6769770"," I thought it was fucking great."
"6770230","6775570"," And this one right here, I was like, what the fuck are they thinking?"
"6778150","6779150"," Who okayed this?"
"6780610","6781590"," Who okayed this?"
"6789010","6790330"," No, you never thought you see this."
"6790450","6792330"," I fucking called the roll in January, dude. "
"6792470","6796090"," I called that shit in September of 2022."
"6796270","6797410"," I called that shit."
"6797630","6798450"," I call all the top. "
"6798610","6800590"," I've been calling tops for years and bottoms."
"6801750","6806110"," So, now, but cyclically, you'll see me shift back and forth."
"6806630","6808330"," He gets to know me for a few years and you'll know. "
"6809670","6813070"," He gets to know me for like three to five years and you'll be like, yeah, I've seen him be"
"6813070","6813630"," a fucking bear."
"6817990","6820350"," How do I believe he gives signals out during his speech?"
"6820590","6820770"," I do."
"6821670","6823930"," And I think it was a very clear message yesterday. "
"6824450","6831750"," I think the message yesterday was, I know what you guys want."
"6832530","6833050"," Right?"
"6833310","6835470"," Cause he knows the banks want to front run this shit."
"6836350","6840050"," And so he, you can, you can tell that he came out yesterday. "
"6841590","6849830"," And felt the need to, uh, to overemphasize the hire for longer."
"6850130","6850850"," You can tell, right?"
"6851050","6854490"," You can, he didn't just come out yesterday and say hire for longer."
"6854950","6857210"," He fucking broke out the charts yesterday. "
"6858650","6860970"," And you don't, he doesn't need to do that."
"6860970","6864010"," He, he doesn't know anybody that he just needs to tell you."
"6864370","6870530"," Uh, we're skipping expect another rate increase, possibly another one data dependence into next"
"6870530","6870850"," year. "
"6871910","6873990"," Done, done."
"6875130","6876430"," Uh, I'll take a, I'll take a question."
"6876650","6877030"," Fuck you. "
"6877430","6878390"," Uh, I'll take a question."
"6878670","6879130"," Fuck you."
"6879770","6880450"," I'll take another question. "
"6880930","6881310"," Fuck you."
"6881910","6883690"," That's what he needed to do yesterday."
"6884690","6886950"," Uh, and that did not happen. "
"6886950","6889850"," He had to thread the eye of the needle yesterday again."
"6890230","6898030"," And, uh, he went, he went, um, what was the, um, uh, what was that movie?"
"6898710","6901610"," He went when you go full regard."
"6902470","6908090"," I don't want to say that, but, uh, you know, the movie that I'm talking about where, uh, simple"
"6908090","6908870"," Jack, right?"
"6909230","6913810"," Like they got simple Jack and it's like, you got a little too much into the character, right?"
"6913810","6919130"," You played the character a little too, uh, too, too well, right?"
"6919890","6922070"," Uh, you went, you went a little overboard there. "
"6922170","6924070"," There was no need for that yesterday."
"6924670","6928690"," Uh, no one needed you or wanted you to say any of that yesterday."
"6929010","6932490"," We didn't need to see four or five charts that I'd find unfucking fin to it any day of the"
"6932490","6932670"," week. "
"6933630","6934990"," With you showing them to me."
"6935550","6939810"," You are the leader, leader of our markets."
"6940370","6940810"," You are. "
"6940810","6943710"," Uh, the president is not the leader of our markets."
"6944610","6947610"," Uh, basically the fed chairman is."
"6949930","6950850"," Traffic thunder. "
"6951170","6952930"," It was a traffic thunder moment for me."
"6953550","6956030"," It really was."
"6959470","6960550"," Oh, wait a minute. "
"6960630","6963670"," I got told I cap enough with the storytelling where we buying spy calls."
"6964190","6968210"," Um, uh, we ain't buying spy calls."
"6968950","6969730"," We're not. "
"6971050","6971550"," We're not."
"6971610","6973250"," Does that say by spy calls up there?"
"6973830","6974810"," What does that say right there?"
"6975610","6976930"," Fuck does that say right there?"
"6978590","6980450"," Does that say by spy calls?"
"6982530","6984310"," Does that say spot by spy calls?"
"6984810","6985450"," Something in the chat."
"6985650","6986810"," Tell me what that reads right there. "
"6988150","6989350"," Can you read that right there?"
"6989470","6989990"," What does that say?"
"6990650","6991470"," You guys read English?"
"6991710","6992410"," What does that say right there?"
"6994090","6995510"," It's L O N G."
"6996510","7003610"," Uh, backslash S S H O R T M O N I T O R I N G."
"7004110","7005750"," It says, uh, positioning."
"7006630","7007350"," Right there."
"7007990","7009430"," It says short, right?"
"7009670","7010190"," Right next to it. "
"7011290","7012490"," So, uh, I don't know."
"7012950","7014250"," Uh, what do you want from me here?"
"7014350","7015050"," I'll blow it up for you."
"7015110","7015830"," Make it bigger for you. "
"7016930","7018150"," Well, let me make it bigger."
"7018290","7018770"," Hold on a second here."
"7019630","7024000"," Put that right there for you. "
"7024000","7025880"," I'll leave that right there for you."
"7026900","7027600"," All right."
"7027820","7029680"," We'll leave that right there for you in the chat. "
"7030220","7031920"," You let me know when I'm buying calls."
"7032260","7032420"," Okay."
"7036620","7037940"," You let me know. "
"7038960","7040100"," You let me know."
"7040560","7041040"," Do that thing."
"7042420","7043360"," Let me know. "
"7044360","7045720"," You know, big, that thing is."
"7046060","7047380"," See where my cursor is right there?"
"7047640","7050720"," When that chip changes green, you tell me, we'll buy some calls together."
"7057220","7059100"," When that happens, we'll buy some calls. "
"7059340","7059440"," Okay."
"7060700","7063420"," I'll leave that up for you specifically so you can read it."
"7063500","7064720"," Probably on your phone or something. "
"7065240","7066940"," Still, I'll make it bigger for you to read."
"7074080","7075300"," I'll leave that up for you."
"7075460","7077920"," When that turns green, let me know and I'll enter with you. "
"7080740","7083340"," Moment that fucker turns green, we'll buy some calls together."
"7083500","7083700"," Okay."
"7091210","7092610"," Otherwise, you ain't doing shit. "
"7093970","7096750"," You ain't doing shit until that happens."
"7108080","7108760"," Good job."
"7108920","7109320"," Congratulations. "
"7110980","7112740"," Someone just bought five calls, five minutes ago."
"7112860","7113120"," Good job."
"7113760","7113800"," Sure. "
"7114000","7115040"," That works out most of the time."
"7117120","7118020"," Absolutely positive."
"7118300","7118440"," Sure. "

"7139530","7140910"," Immediately full port calls."
"7141350","7144170"," Yeah, we'll look at a T and X next. "
"7147130","7148090"," Give me one quick second."
"7148230","7148270"," Really?"
"7148450","7148750"," T and X."
"7149210","7150230"," One second."
"7156810","7157270"," One quick second. "
"7157430","7158430"," I'm going to move some stuff over here."
"7158430","7165760"," Oh, that's so much better."
"7165980","7167460"," I got some weirdness going on with. "
"7177030","7177830"," Come on now."
"7179250","7180190"," It's right down here."

"7185310","7186390"," Keep your eyes right here."
"7187210","7191490"," I'll make this big for who's asking more buying calls so he can watch."
"7192610","7196470"," You want to see price. "
"7206060","7206500"," Above."
"7208400","7209920"," And that cross right there."
"7213220","7215440"," If you see that, we can enter some calls. "
"7216480","7218080"," Well, not that, but this."
"7219420","7222180"," I should have should I should get rid of that arrow right there."
"7223100","7224860"," Buy some calls right there if you want. "
"7226600","7228000"," We're not quite there just yet."
"7228000","7228320"," So."
"7231120","7231820"," Almost there. "
"7231900","7232480"," We're not quite there."
"7232820","7234400"," No, no place to buy calls here."
"7235000","7239420"," Hey, you're welcome. "
"7239920","7240320"," Big Harry."
"7240500","7240620"," Don."

"7248700","7252400"," VIX trying to trade 1841."
"7256430","7258050"," VIX trade in 1646. "
"7258630","7259570"," It wants to trade."
"7259710","7262390"," I said that, but I really want to say 1740."
"7263790","7265850"," Now that's 1740 1702. "
"7266010","7267790"," It started to push back a little bit right now."
"7268610","7272310"," I've got a 1696 1686 1662."
"7273630","7274890"," Let's have a look at it right now. "
"7275210","7277490"," It just sold on the 1662."
"7278230","7279890"," It's been pretty bullish here right now."
"7279990","7283310"," So no, no call buying right now for me. "
"7284710","7286890"," HYG week right now."
"7286890","7290330"," No crossover to the upside and HYG in a one minute as of as of yet."

"7295570","7297590"," Dixie rolling down and testing."
"7297790","7300090"," It's one 29 EMA and a 15 minute chart."
"7301070","7305570"," On a one minute, though, it's trying to regain the 27 EMA. "
"7305930","7308830"," Apple trying to hold on to its 27 EMA right now."
"7309170","7309530"," Disney."
"7310850","7312710"," Holding its pants up this morning. "
"7312750","7314530"," Good to see Disney holding its pants up."
"7315410","7319010"," Nasdaq underneath its 27 EMA on a one minute chart."
"7324460","7327740"," Looking for a cross on spy to buy calls. "
"7328460","7331200"," Still no cross on the one and five minute."
"7332860","7335720"," Triggers until we see that cross in the one and five minute trigger."
"7335920","7338600"," There is no trade for me to the upside. "

"7357800","7360280"," 437 C currently."
"7360980","7363100"," They're trading eight pennies."
"7363380","7365480"," Eight cents right now for that trade. "
"7366380","7369840"," Eight cents to the upside to 437."
"7370940","7380760"," There is another sell point just below it at 435.95. Then you've got the 437.06 above."
"7381420","7383840"," We'll put two price targets to the upside for you there. "
"7384560","7385260"," You can see them."
"7386060","7387400"," We'll do two price targets."
"7387640","7397420"," The first one is 435.98. Already blown through"
"7397420","7397960"," that one. "
"7398860","7400180"," You've got that one right there."
"7406860","7408800"," Here's your PT one right here."

"7491940","7493640"," Here's your price right now."
"7493700","7495720"," It's below the trigger right here."
"7495920","7498000"," If you do get across at any point. "
"7500160","7502040"," If you get a cross up here."
"7503820","7505920"," If you get a cross up here right."
"7508800","7509660"," With price. "
"7518260","7524420"," If you get a cross up here right this cross starts right in here."
"7524420","7531620"," You put on some calls and you trade it to PT one and PT two."
"7531680","7532380"," Here's PT one. "
"7533020","7534120"," Here's PT two."
"7535400","7540860"," You can either grab yourself some 436s or some 437s through the upside."
"7545310","7546410"," There you go. "
"7546490","7547510"," If you're looking for your calls."
"7548050","7550250"," I'm not a call buyer here right now personally."
"7554430","7556850"," I'm looking for lows, baby. "
"7556990","7559590"," I'm looking for what am I looking for here?"
"7560330","7563290"," I'm looking for this one down here."
"7565010","7566630"," I'll buy some calls down here."
"7568150","7570190"," See that price target right down there?"
"7571590","7572950"," I'll buy some calls down there. "
"7574010","7575590"," You want to see it on the other chart?"
"7581520","7582540"," It's down here."
"7585840","7587200"," You see it right there?"
"7588880","7590440"," Price target, weekly trigger."
"7597000","7598940"," Right down there so you can see that. "
"7609560","7611320"," Not that far off from it, are we?"
"7611460","7611940"," It's right over there."
"7613580","7615940"," Maybe just delete that thing and just do a new one."
"7616100","7616320"," Hold on. "
"7626760","7636570"," It's actually right now at 429.54. It wasn't expecting us to get there until later this"
"7636570","7636810"," week."
"7638330","7640310"," They actually could possibly do 420."
"7641750","7643990"," But find out we do it right now. "
"7644230","7645570"," There's the price target right there."
"7650020","7650960"," Main screen."
"7658380","7659700"," There's a PT one. "
"7660900","7662060"," There's a PT two."
"7665280","7667360"," You can see that on your screen right there."
"7667920","7671220"," Right there. "
"7695360","7700340"," I got a hundred pack of 436 lined up."
"7703990","7705590"," Go back and change this here."
"7708670","7710850"," Five and six and seven and eight and nine. "
"7711770","7714550"," You get a hundred pack of 436 lined up."
"7715290","7719070"," All I'm waiting for is a cross of the white and yellow."
"7720350","7726410"," So I'm just looking for just looking for that cross right there. "
"7727130","7728430"," So you can see it right there."
"7728670","7732150"," Yep, right there."
"7732850","7734010"," That's basically it right there. "
"7734370","7738330"," Cross cross and I want to see a green bar."
"7738650","7739650"," I want to see a green bar."
"7739910","7740890"," I want to see a green bar. "
"7741090","7741950"," I want to see a green bar."
"7742570","7743950"," Then I want to see a red bar."
"7745930","7746570"," Right there. "
"7750760","7755120"," I want that cross so I can fire that shit off to the upside."
"7757560","7758400"," Until that happens."
"7759400","7760440"," Not quite there yet. "
"7760640","7760960"," Just waiting."
"7770880","7771960"," I'm just looking for that."
"7772080","7774180"," I'm just looking for that confirmation white bar cross. "
"7774520","7774760"," That's it."
"7775380","7777740"," I'm looking for the break above on the white to red."
"7778680","7780020"," I'll put a price above it. "
"7780560","7782080"," And then I'm looking for a test of it."
"7782680","7785160"," So I don't get caught in a bear trap."
"7786400","7787720"," Fucking bear traps, man. "
"7788460","7789660"," Don't want to get caught in a bear trap."
"7789840","7790960"," This is a bear trap right here."
"7792020","7793140"," You want to see the bear trap?"
"7796380","7796980"," Right here. "
"7798200","7800240"," The cross is there, but not yet, right?"
"7801180","7806100"," You want to see the, let me see if I can explain this better."
"7807600","7812360"," Let's see how the white line it."
"7812480","7813360"," Oh, you guys can't see that. "
"7813760","7816800"," Well, I'll bring that over for you."
"7817380","7818580"," This is a great example."
"7820780","7822620"," See how white lines coming up right there?"
"7824660","7826660"," You got the initial, initial squeeze higher. "
"7830400","7832820"," Then you get the immediate rejection to the downside."
"7833500","7834720"," That's the failure, right?"
"7835240","7836760"," So you bought a call right here."
"7836900","7837480"," You'd lose, right?"
"7838660","7842660"," You bought a call on this green bar right here and this white line coming up. "
"7842720","7843660"," You'd be a loser again."
"7844160","7845140"," You'd be a loser again."
"7846200","7848000"," So loser, loser, loser. "
"7848560","7849580"," Would this time be the difference?"
"7850600","7851580"," Is this time the difference?"
"7852460","7853820"," It doesn't matter if it is."
"7854360","7859520"," What matters is it's like loser, loser, loser buying a dip."
"7859680","7861960"," By dip, loser, by dip, loser, by dip, loser. "
"7862660","7864220"," Is this the magic right down here?"
"7864220","7865640"," You don't know."
"7866560","7877760"," So the way that you find out is the way that you find out is, if"
"7877760","7881340"," it's a winner, is you get this green bar right here."
"7881620","7886260"," You actually go higher briefly, hopefully. "
"7887920","7892620"," The previous high there, you come back down over here."
"7896770","7898510"," See that reversal candle right there?"
"7899470","7900830"," See that reversal candle right there?"
"7905510","7907010"," What are you looking for right here?"
"7907250","7908270"," You're looking for a green candle."
"7910110","7912390"," You're looking for a fucking green candle. "
"7912750","7914190"," Did you see a green candle there?"
"7914930","7915550"," See a green candle there?"
"7916130","7916810"," See a green candle there?"
"7917010","7917010"," Nope."
"7917690","7919250"," That's three losers trying to buy a dip."
"7920330","7920770"," No. "
"7920770","7920870"," know."
"7921850","7923750"," We wait and watch and see what happens here."
"7927410","7928250"," Set them up. "
"7930190","7931330"," 436 C."
"7933910","7936030"," You don't buy this candle."
"7937790","7942250"," You're waiting to see that cross and that there's no rejection and turnaround."
"7942250","7943950"," You need the confirmation first. "
"7950070","7951850"," Get a nice green candle right here."
"7951970","7952630"," Push this one up."
"7953330","7954510"," 11.50 right now. "
"7955190","7959690"," Ten minutes left for the bears until the 12 o'clock hour."
"7962130","7963270"," They got ten minutes."
"7964490","7971370"," They got a new low at 11.15. Bulls bought 11.30 here. "
"7972310","7973090"," We're at the half an hour."
"7973090","7978150"," The bulls did buy this candle down here at 11.30. So bulls are buying."
"7978950","7982490"," So bulls have in the next ten minutes to get a new high. "
"7983070","7985410"," So it's 11.50 right."
"7987970","7992290"," Bull's gonna need right here."
"7993710","7994750"," Next ten minutes. "
"7995750","7997170"," Bulls want to be right there."
"8003920","8005040"," Next ten minutes."
"8005240","8006300"," Bulls want this right here. "
"8006420","8009370"," They want this bad boy."
"8019730","8021910"," The cute little, cute little arrow right there."
"8026250","8027370"," Next ten minutes. "
"8028610","8045520"," Bulls want 4.35.50. Don't"
"8045520","8046980"," tell me spy calls are paying."
"8047340","8048120"," You got your fucking mind."
"8049980","8050920"," Who is this person?"
"8051800","8053900"," Let me go find this fucking retard here. "
"8073430","8074670"," Say out of your mind."
"8108000","8115340"," I'll be, I'll be, I'll be easy on the hard"
"8115340","8119500"," word."
"8119500","8120100"," This is what I meant. "
"8134960","8140490"," You got a red candle going down right now."
"8140530","8141970"," Still no green candle above."
"8142350","8143930"," No cross of the white and red yet. "
"8147030","8148390"," Hopefully this can hold."
"8159040","8162060"," Please don't let this all be red panels to the depths of hell."
"8169540","8172220"," It's 11.53. You got seven minutes left to get a green candle. "
"8172300","8173460"," Come on bulls baby."
"8175600","8176860"," You can pull it together."
"8200700","8203879"," Don't lose the white line from when I was a kid when it was acceptable but it's not acceptable"
"8203879","8204139"," anymore. "
"8204360","8205379"," It isn't, I shouldn't say that word."
"8206459","8207540"," It's not a good word to say."
"8207959","8209100"," I try not to say it. "
"8209440","8210620"," I actively try not to."
"8210780","8213120"," So just saying it, I apologize for saying it."
"8214500","8215940"," It's not an appropriate thing to say. "
"8220900","8224900"," Probably still trading underneath the 2070 of me right now, the one minute trigger."
"8225120","8226580"," So wait and see what's up."
"8228959","8230600"," Bull's have to pull it out of their ass here. "
"8234790","8235650"," It's not me."
"8235969","8244750"," I said it's a holdover from, there's some really bad like any guys know the old racist"
"8244750","8246809"," side hand side."
"8246990","8247670"," Well not racist. "
"8248010","8249209"," They're like chauvinistic racist."
"8249910","8250410"," They're everything."
"8250690","8258110"," They're like the worst things in the world but when I was a kid you didn't mean anything by it"
"8258110","8264330"," but you really did hurt people's feelings by saying a lot of mean words and it's not nice to say"
"8264330","8265049"," that stuff right. "
"8265230","8268410"," You really are hurting people's feelings and disparaging people and you shouldn't be."
"8268990","8270490"," Even if your intent isn't that."
"8271250","8272010"," So I get it. "
"8272150","8276490"," I get the reason why not to say those things but it does slip every once in"
"8276490","8283990"," a while so I do one minute trigger right now."
"8284070","8285790"," One minute trigger trying to fight its way back higher."
"8287490","8294309"," Sometimes we can extend that half an hour to like 11 to 12.05 so bulls have to like 12 "
"8294309","8296670",".05 p.m. to regain right now. "
"8297270","8299889"," Now they did buy the 11.30 bar down here."
"8300590","8302969"," So you can see this 11.30 bar right here."
"8303110","8309049"," They did buy this so they are making an attempt on the half hour to recover but they have to"
"8309049","8315670"," win that half an hour and so far they have not won it so either expect a giant squeeze right"
"8315670","8318850"," now or a reversal to the downside. "

"9790620","9798500"," that i wouldn't it was like guaranteed forever copyright free music right only condoned by youtube"
"9798500","9805760"," specifically of all places and then youtube rolled out a creator like hey let's share revenues or"
"9805760","9812040"," hey you can use this new music copyright free what they didn't highlight to you was in the"
"9812040","9820660"," background uh they have this little fine print that says it's copyright free but if we don't renew"
"9820660","9827440"," the license in a week or three months or a year it doesn't matter they'll they'll start to monetize"
"9827440","9834940"," your videos so there's like this undercurrent in the music copyrighted music and copyright free"

"11186800","11196720"," to far apart and thesis yeah you're probably whatever we can get 4200"
"11196720","11204240"," right um there's about a 40% chance you can get 4200 between now and uh the second week of"
"11204240","11214990"," october 40% chance of that not guaranteed uh do you want to see it real quick there's a"
"11214990","11221530"," 40% you have some things on your side chase to get that 420 it's not guaranteed i'm not going"
"11221530","11233470"," to expect a reaction off of uh then i expect a reaction off 430 chase and"
"11233470","11242350"," then you want to see if we sell this up here uh if we reject ready chase ready for three"
"11242350","11251450"," targets give me three targets ready uh 429 54 bounce we trade uh 443.89"

"11317290","11323790"," right now if what you need to be or what i'm focused on what i'm focused on right now is"
"11323790","11333590"," hitting that 430 the bounce up to uh 443 if that holds or not uh if it holds we"
"11333590","11340230"," start heading higher we're good to go we'll keep running uh if we break below 430 and hold below"
"11340230","11347790"," 430 that's bad if we reject 443 and start going down that's really bad you're looking at 420 then"
"11347790","11351370"," you'll be looking for a bounce back at 430 and then that would open the fucking door to i think"
"11351370","11359510"," i think it's 415 or something uh it's 415 or 405 i can't remember you start breaking all that shit"
"11359510","11367790"," it's uh it gets real ugly it gets it gets doozy it gets real real doozy-ish i don't think"

"15080620","15083840"," you still need somebody to work it out for you. "
"15088520","15091200"," Yeah that's a lot another long conversation."

"15223930","15227250"," I know a lot of good programmers that hate even working with pine script. "

"15320170","15320690"," So. "
"15322270","15323190"," I've got a."
"15326350","15330470"," Or we rephrase this so I played D&D for years."
"15330470","15337890"," And then I stopped playing D&D after advanced Dungeons and Dragons."
"15340470","15342730"," About five years ago. "
"15343590","15347550"," Is it five yeah maybe five three and a half five years ago."
"15348190","15353730"," I started replaying when they came out with 5E started replaying Dungeons"
"15353730","15360450"," and Dragons."
"15361610","15363890"," And then we would play D&D. "
"15365050","15370790"," In the winter time so I live in Michigan right now and then winter you really have to be creative."
"15371730","15374530"," If you don't live in like if you don't live in like the beach or live."
"15375550","15377890"," In the mountains you live in like the Midwest. "
"15378870","15383570"," You kind of have to find creative ways to keep yourself entertained in the winter time."
"15384290","15388110"," And it's one of the things that we do and the cool part about Dungeons and Dragons is."
"15388110","15390610"," If you play it with a young child. "
"15392010","15394670"," It is like a practical way."
"15395930","15397750"," It's a practical way to."
"15400610","15402310"," It's a practical way to. "
"15402990","15404590"," If you have a child right."
"15405710","15408810"," Dungeons and Dragons is crazy for kid like that."
"15408810","15409590"," These are imagination. "
"15410690","15413470"," They have to problem solve."
"15414870","15415770"," They have to like."
"15416750","15418710"," Think way outside of the box. "
"15420210","15421930"," They have to think way out."
"15422110","15424170"," They used to have to think way outside of the box."
"15427050","15429650"," They used to in the old school D&D. "
"15429870","15433010"," It requires a lot of free thinking."
"15434830","15437570"," So I went back and started playing 5E."
"15439250","15439910"," And. "
"15441410","15444770"," For the life of me have not been happy playing it."
"15445370","15448690"," I've not been happy at all."
"15449730","15451010"," Playing 5E. "
"15451390","15451750"," And."
"15452830","15455430"," I never got in Pathfinder never got into."
"15456910","15460270"," But I didn't like too many like I wasn't like the person that. "
"15460730","15463630"," I wasn't the person that wanted to."
"15463630","15468730"," I don't like lose rules lawyering."
"15468790","15469210"," I don't like. "
"15472050","15476150"," It's hard to say because like 5E gives you a lot of choices."
"15477330","15480430"," But at the same time you're reading those choices."
"15481410","15482530"," Rather than thinking them up. "
"15486960","15491820"," So actual role playing and I couldn't figure out why I wasn't happy with 5E."
"15492460","15493500"," Watching this right now."
"15493500","15494300"," I don't want to see this. "
"15495840","15497400"," I'm still in some calls right now."
"15497420","15497840"," My stops."
"15497840","15499460"," They're going to try to take them out right now. "
"15501260","15502540"," They're still up right now."
"15502580","15503760"," But they're trying to take my stops out."
"15503760","15504520"," So I got to watch this. "
"15508540","15509880"," Watch this close right here."
"15512240","15513700"," They're trying to stop me out here."
"15521580","15523180"," Still tested the test me right now. "
"15523180","15523620"," Still up."
"15523800","15525800"," I got four more pennies right here."
"15526580","15527960"," I'm flat at 27. "
"15528000","15529380"," So we'll see."
"15539770","15542170"," So 5E I thought I would enjoy it."
"15542390","15546090"," And I have not been enjoying my experience with 5E. "
"15546310","15552530"," A lot of the 5 my experience with 5E is I've got two problems with it."
"15553130","15554650"," You're starting out."
"15554650","15559530"," And I did this is this is the moment the Gary Larson point. "
"15560290","15563390"," There's a Gary Larson cartoon where they have the school for the gifted."
"15564110","15566310"," And there's a kid pushing on the door."
"15567230","15569170"," And the door says pull. "
"15570090","15571810"," And he's pushing on the door right."
"15572790","15574170"," This kid's supposed to be smart."
"15574730","15578430"," And you know he's not he's not smart. "
"15578750","15584210"," And it's taken me three to five years to figure out that."
"15586010","15591030"," The reason I wasn't enjoying 5E was because."
"15592670","15595730"," The reason I wasn't enjoying 5E was because. "
"15598710","15599550"," The."
"15600350","15603310"," The original role play was taken away from it."
"15605010","15606630"," For me and. "
"15607390","15609390"," You're automatically a superhero."
"15611770","15614950"," In 5E now there's a ton about 5E that I love."
"15615670","15617790"," I actually like a ton about 5E. "
"15618330","15618630"," But."
"15621850","15624750"," Like when you're a an instant suit."
"15624970","15626670"," So I like the idea of. "
"15627110","15629550"," Playing a character that might not be a superhero."
"15630590","15632750"," I like the idea of."
"15634030","15635610"," A character who. "
"15636490","15637090"," Is."
"15637930","15641250"," Special like has something unique about them."
"15641850","15645190"," That makes them more unique than a regular person. "
"15646350","15647710"," But not superhero."
"15649830","15652790"," Your extraordinary one or two things."
"15653890","15655050"," From a normal. "
"15656610","15657990"," Person in D and D."
"15658110","15659630"," I don't want to talk about this because so corny."
"15659950","15660310"," But."
"15660310","15666450"," I don't like being an instant superhero that I can't lose. "
"15666670","15668130"," I can't die that I can't all this."
"15668330","15669870"," Like not taking serious."
"15670290","15673270"," Not having like a even though it's a fantasy world not having. "
"15674810","15676410"," A real consequences."
"15677590","15678910"," For my actions."
"15679930","15683710"," So a lot of D and D 5E for me is like. "
"15685050","15688410"," Let's be murder hobo's and kill everything on site."
"15689130","15690830"," And nothing can kill me."
"15693010","15694710"," And I'd forgotten that. "
"15697090","15700730"," That old D and D one of the biggest pleasures of it was."
"15701490","15702950"," That there's other choices."
"15703270","15705790"," There's like negotiating there's running there's. "
"15707370","15710530"," Maybe a weapon that you didn't expect to be there searching for."
"15711010","15715230"," Stuff that's in your environment to help you out that you might not have on you."
"15715230","15718190"," There's all kinds of like making friendships with. "
"15719210","15721110"," Hirelings all kinds of stuff like that."
"15722010","15724970"," Making friends with towns people rather than killing them on site."
"15729830","15732370"," Like all these options are just taken away. "
"15734310","15736590"," And making shit up as we go along."
"15736890","15738870"," So there's a part of Dungeons and Dragons where."
"15740110","15744190"," You can make shit up as you go along or a player makes shit up as they go along. "
"15744190","15745690"," Shit that you didn't expect."
"15746090","15747850"," Now that stuff can be game breaking."
"15749250","15752850"," And turn out really bad or break a game. "
"15753490","15756530"," But there's there's something about it that."
"15757890","15759970"," An adult doesn't remember."
"15760910","15766950"," But a kid like a young child is exceptional at. "
"15768490","15770830"," So I don't know if this is all adults."
"15770830","15772890"," I'm going to subscribe to all adults."
"15773090","15773910"," But a young person. "
"15774870","15776570"," Does really well with."
"15777330","15778210"," Does really."
"15778410","15779030"," Oh, they're going to try it. "
"15779370","15779490"," There."
"15780590","15780910"," No."
"15781170","15781690"," Come on. "
"15782330","15783030"," Fuck you."
"15790020","15790860"," Pink cider."
"15793180","15795900"," I fucking hate fucking stop hunting. "
"15805080","15806560"," Up three pennies right now."
"15810820","15816340"," I hate stop hunting because I hate five because it takes away."
"15816560","15818300"," I got two more pennies left than I'm out there. "
"15818380","15819680"," They're they're they're hunting me right now."
"15829510","15830990"," I'm not a fan of."
"15845540","15847800"," Up three right now is up two for a moment. "
"15861320","15863780"," I'm taking a nope no fail."
"15863780","15864500"," Hold on a second."
"15874680","15877520"," I'm going to take a 29 cents on four thirty five. "
"15877740","15879120"," I got about two pennies and make shit."
"15879360","15880540"," So I'm out."
"15881020","15881640"," I'm flat right now. "
"15881920","15886420"," I don't want to get fucking stopped out here."
"15886440","15887260"," I'm fucking pissy."
"15887400","15889680"," I don't want to go like down here and then back up here. "
"15889680","15891360"," So let's take two fucking pennies."
"15891720","15894680"," I'm going to wait a minute here and see if we reverse to the upside and take it again."
"15896060","15897900"," You know D&D is a weird thing right now. "
"15897900","15901700"," Like I didn't realize that five E is what my problem was."
"15901700","15904720"," I thought that my problem was that I hadn't played D&D long enough."
"15905360","15909100"," Like I'd spent so long not playing D&D that I didn't enjoy it. "
"15910620","15912000"," I would have gotten stopped there."
"15914440","15915280"," Hold on a second here."
"15919820","15921620"," We'll see if we catch this bounce right here. "
"15922520","15923860"," I'm stopped out right now."
"15923960","15924540"," I'm not flat."
"15926320","15927680"," There's stop hunting right now. "
"15938450","15939530"," We roll back up."
"15939670","15940390"," I'll jump back in."
"15940630","15941890"," We got to roll back up here though. "
"15944430","15946310"," No go for me unless we do that right there."
"15947190","15948630"," It's like Dungeons and Dragons."
"15948850","15953030"," I thought that maybe it's like something was wrong with me playing Dungeons and Dragons. "
"15953630","15960810"," So recently I got back into the OSR. If you don't know what that is."
"15961310","15966150"," It's like old school Renaissance Dungeons and Dragons style play. "
"15967590","15977250"," And I can't believe that I didn't realize that that was what I was"
"15977250","15978510"," missing."
"15978930","15982510"," I was missing the old school Dungeons and Dragons experience."
"15983110","15988030"," And my kids are happier. "
"15989390","15991450"," Playing that version."
"15992170","15996090"," And even my wife used to never play with me."
"15997330","16000610"," And even she's taken it up because it's become. "
"16002290","16004450"," So absurdly funny."
"16006450","16016430"," Most games end in literal crying tears because it's I try to relate"
"16016430","16017290"," it right now to."
"16020670","16025310"," Like a like a hype or a pumped up version of Mad Libs. "
"16025850","16027370"," It's the best way to describe it."
"16027450","16031810"," Remember when you're a kid and you play Mad Libs and your parents wouldn't read them."
"16031810","16034470"," You do it for your parents and you'd say nice things in front of your parents. "
"16034830","16037370"," And then you'd be playing with your friends or your siblings."
"16038250","16043390"," And you'd say like all the bad words not be like not shit and all that stuff but like poop"
"16043390","16048450"," and farting and hairy toes and all the gross things that a kid thinks about."
"16049870","16052870"," And so we play a we've been we've been playing this year. "
"16054810","16059330"," OSR rules and it devolves into well first of all."
"16060310","16066830"," I'm shocked at a child's imagination playing with OSR rules because they just think up all kinds of"
"16066830","16067430"," craziness."
"16068270","16071270"," Things that I could never plan or think of for them. "
"16074210","16082590"," And the games usually end with us crying laughing because I can't believe that we're in whatever"
"16082590","16088490"," situation that they're in for how they defeated a bad guy"
"16088490","16093950"," playing Dungeons and Dragons."
"16093950","16101770"," And so I've been trying to use so the OSR stuff doesn't have a ton of pre-made."
"16102150","16104430"," There is there's some like pre-made stuff. "
"16104770","16109510"," There used to be like magazines and stuff but a lot of that stuff is geared towards dungeon"
"16109510","16111710"," crawling and I don't do just the dungeon crawling."
"16113550","16121970"," We do everything we go everywhere and do crazy as shit but it's been a it's been a big thing"
"16121970","16123370"," that I didn't realize."
"16123370","16129370"," I'm like, like how did I not realize that it was because it was 5 E and not OSR. Or"
"16129370","16132150"," it was it was it was because I was playing 5 E that it wasn't."
"16133550","16136190"," It wasn't satisfied with the gameplay."
"16138390","16139750"," Yeah, I'm out of calls right now. "
"16139950","16141310"," I got out made three pennies."
"16141450","16143670"," If we go back above that white line, I'll jump back in again."
"16148090","16153750"," But right now, it took 29 cents on 27 and I'll jump back in if we get above here. "
"16153870","16154950"," They were trying to stop on me."
"16155110","16155710"," I didn't want to lose."
"16155830","16156650"," I don't want to lose so. "
"16162030","16171370"," Yeah, the there's like I got real issues with I got a bunch of issues with with 5 E like."
"16173610","16178530"," If you're if you really love math and you're in a group of players that really love math, I can"
"16178530","16181110"," understand the compellingness of it."
"16182350","16183630"," Or why it's compelling. "
"16185210","16188810"," I enjoy the role playing aspect of it or the."
"16190590","16192650"," Yeah, the role playing aspect of it."
"16192650","16195410"," And then I also really enjoy the. "
"16203630","16205150"," I really enjoy."
"16206350","16214110"," The freedom that that OSR leaves versus trying to create like a hero that's like a super hero, not"
"16214110","16215810"," just a hero, like a hero."
"16216390","16217450"," But think about this like. "
"16218290","16219750"," I can simplify this easily."
"16219850","16220690"," So if you're."
"16221550","16225750"," Remember how like you played if you've ever played a sport or you've ever. "
"16226410","16229250"," Let's say something that you're good at, but not great."
"16229570","16230210"," You're good at it."
"16230690","16235030"," So like you're like, okay, I'm a really good writer or I'm a really good math. "
"16235810","16239830"," But then there was that one kid in class that or one kid that you played sports with."
"16240290","16242530"," Like you played I got played soccer growing up, right?"
"16244310","16246290"," And I was a good soccer player."
"16246410","16247230"," I was really good. "
"16247330","16250650"," I was good enough to play D2 soccer and D3."
"16250770","16251490"," I was good enough for both."
"16251490","16253690"," Well, D3 is the first of course and then deep do. "
"16253990","16256210"," But I was good enough to play in D2 team if I wanted to."
"16256890","16263150"," I played D3 for a school in college on an academic scholarship, right?"
"16263770","16265170"," But I wasn't that good."
"16266070","16267270"," And when I played in high school. "
"16268510","16272250"," There were players in high school that were way better than me."
"16272750","16276170"," And those players went on and played really a high level soccer."
"16278010","16280250"," So looking at that perspective, right?"
"16281670","16288110"," Oh, I saw one of the cool things is you have like one gift, you know, just like that soccer"
"16288110","16288350"," player. "
"16288870","16291470"," But you're not a real true superhero, right?"
"16292310","16295290"," And 5e is like, you're like a fucking superhero."
"16295590","16296850"," You're like Superman and shit."
"16297410","16302210"," You're like building your character and you want, you have like all these proficiencies and your"
"16302210","16303030"," profession in this. "
"16303030","16311850"," And, you know, they're like, you got an 18 and then you got like a plus eight on hits."
"16312110","16312970"," Like it's just insanity."
"16314030","16316430"," You're doing like crazy damage on bad guys. "
"16316710","16322930"," You're like, just like fucking the things you got to put in front of a 5e player."
"16323350","16328530"," Like, I don't even know how you play a 5e character to like higher levels than 10."
"16329430","16330930"," Like, what are they fighting?"
"16331790","16333970"," Like, they're like pretty much immortal at that point, right?"
"16339170","16340210"," Still bleeding here. "
"16341550","16343530"," Price gets back above that white line."
"16343690","16345190"," I'll get back in on calls right now."
"16345250","16345690"," I got nothing. "
"16346450","16347530"," No trade to go long here."
"16352220","16354680"," They're going to get a rejection to the downside right here."
"16357180","16362900"," Seller is looking for a rejection for a reversal to the downside for a bear playing to the downside"
"16362900","16363660"," right now. "
"16364620","16365740"," See if they get that."
"16366000","16369840"," If you're a put buyer, you're about to get your chance here in just a moment."
"16372520","16374160"," That's what you want to sell right there. "
"16381020","16381940"," You're a put buyer."
"16382260","16382980"," This is where you sell."
"16383240","16384080"," We'll see if you can do it. "
"16385439","16387540"," Put buyers when we sell on this right here."
"16413009","16422910"," So I kind of want like, I like the idea of making like, you know, like making like 10"
"16422910","16423990"," characters."
"16423990","16431590"," And if only one of them lives to see level three or four, so be it. "
"16431849","16435070"," And then you build out that character's background and all that kind of stuff."
"16435669","16438090"," And you make them an extraordinary person."
"16438770","16448710"," So that the player, not the character, but the player feels like this is the one, like this is"
"16448710","16450090"," the character that I'm playing. "
"16450710","16452669"," This character shouldn't have survived."
"16452710","16455869"," This character has does have something special about him."
"16456470","16463910"," And so it's that hero's journey that that player, not the character that player can experience. "
"16464650","16471090"," So if like if a player can experience the hero's journey, it's a it's an amazing thing."
"16471090","16475230"," It's like the feelings that it brings up inside of a player."
"16475990","16478529"," It's not the character that the feelings inside the player. "
"16479230","16480950"," They're they're they're they're crazy."
"16481330","16481770"," They're amazing."
"16482169","16490650"," They're amazing feelings that you have because we play these games to learn and to keep our minds"
"16490650","16491210"," sharp. "
"16492070","16494790"," But we also play these games to enjoy them, right?"
"16495369","16502189"," So for that, like real enjoyment who has a really good chance of having that real enjoyment is a"
"16502189","16502750"," young person."
"16502750","16506169"," They're usually still very fantastical in their minds."
"16506310","16507830"," They think way outside of the box. "
"16507849","16510130"," They haven't been taught in schools not to be free thinkers."
"16511230","16513910"," They still like think they can do anything."
"16514869","16518950"," So that that that part of being young. "
"16519730","16523950"," If you can harness that in the player before they make the car or after they make the character, if"
"16523950","16526810"," that character lives is fascinating."
"16528410","16533590"," So I'm finally realizing that OSRs for me and on that same token, though."
"16534570","16539189"," I want to combine or I want to, of course, adapt OSR to a lot of the five E stuff. "
"16542430","16543810"," Still flat right now."
"16549849","16551310"," See anything here?"
"16554529","16555130"," Nope."
"16557410","16560450"," More garbage, more garbage, more garbage, more trash. "
"16561650","16562529"," I got nothing here."
"16563750","16565930"," I'm watching this fucking shit down here."
"16566070","16567169"," All this garbage down here. "
"16569849","16571369"," Rolling it down right now."
"16571730","16572630"," No joy for bulls."
"16573390","16574590"," No joy to the upside. "
"16577290","16580110"," No joy to the upside right now for bulls."
"16580689","16580689"," None."
"16591470","16596029"," Sellers stepping in, trying to sell this back down, trying to get down even lower into this close"
"16596029","16596390"," here. "
"16598990","16600349"," No joy for bulls."
"16608070","16610390"," Yeah, like you like you like you like."
"16611189","16616810"," And you want to like or not you, but like I want to play a campaign that's all winter. "
"16618250","16619029"," I don't want."
"16619470","16620710"," I don't want."
"16620710","16624349"," I want to play a campaign that's all winter. "
"16624630","16626290"," I don't want to play a campaign that's like."
"16627650","16630750"," There has to be real consequences for the choices that you make."
"16632750","16635869"," In that world stopped out right up here. "
"16637509","16639230"," No trade as a bull right now."
"16653349","16654130"," They're like gods."

"18937120","18941820"," got it but I can't find it I got this big white paper it was a big white paper that"
"18941820","18949640"," involved UV XY and Volmageddon and the structuring of puts and how they don't fucking pay in there"
"18949640","18956660"," the reasoning why they don't pay and then thesis is behind why you'll always be a loser trading"
"18956660","18967630"," puts and I believe that piece is 100% 100% I can't find"
"18967630","18973210"," it I keep looking for it on the internet I can't fucking find it you know I think has it"

"18991370","18998930"," I forget who get was a badass paper it was like 30 pages long and it did like a forensic"
"18998930","19007950"," analysis of Volmageddon and then it also did this whole analysis on trading puts and what their"
"19007950","19012310"," intent is what how they were invented what their what their what their entire intent behind them"
"19012310","19020730"," was good it went through like what futures started out as like why did they create futures they do"
"19020730","19027010"," not have options right you just bought and sold shares in the stock market and then why did they"
"19027010","19035070"," create futures what was the intent how could you manipulate it to your benefit not needing wasn't"
"19035070","19041290"," the intent of futures wasn't for you and I right so what's the mechanics of them why how they built"
"19041290","19048010"," how they most post act same thing applies to when they created calls that was actually for gambling"
"19048010","19055530"," but they're not puts though or not it was the intent of puts was to lend protection for an"
"19055530","19063330"," underlying position and they're just not built to print so they're not built for you making money"
"19063330","19068370"," now some of you probably make a lot of money inputs congratulations to you they're excellence for"
"19068370","19073590"," complex strategies they work wonders for that under those circumstances I like them in those"
"19073590","19081070"," contexts but just like a fucking I'm buying a put I'm not a fan of it"
"19081070","19090230"," yeah they were created for farmers absolutely they're created for farmers you got it"
"19090230","19097910"," well the thesis is they were created for farmers but the banks were like the banks were like well"
"19097910","19104030"," shit if I can had your position in the overnight let's I want I want to I want a piece"
"19104030","19113510"," of that right I might I might dabble in some puts here"
"19113510","19123310"," I'll be honest this is pretty juicy isn't it I'm not gonna lie like if there's a"
"19123310","19133150"," big rejection here that's pretty juicy 430 P's they're one penny right"
"19133150","19142910"," now 430 P's now they're two and three pennies so let's look at so 430"
"19142910","19151290"," P is no let there one penny that's 431 so like 430 P is basically zero so dealers are telling"
"19151290","19156930"," you there's no chance we're going down here there was telling you fuck you know we're not going"
"19156930","19165950"," down there so would you think let me ask you a question do you think that dealers are holding this"
"19165950","19175070"," up to not print 430 so our dealers right here trying to tell you our dealers going to support the"
"19175070","19183050"," market here listen to my thesis closely here do you think a dealer is going to support the market"
"19183050","19190110"," to not print 430 P and if the price still rolls down against them right it's a good this is"
"19190110","19197210"," actually a good it's actually a really good teaching moment so if the dealers will support the"
"19197210","19206730"," market here to not print 430 and you had real money selling here right that overruns a dealer"
"19206730","19215530"," what would a dealer be required to do chase is what the answer is if you don't know and what"
"19215530","19225270"," would a dealer do to the real money selling here they would amplify the move down because they're"
"19225270","19235210"," chasing so you'd have like 10% of the market chasing real money selling that's how you get"
"19235210","19242870"," your blood baths we'll pay close attention to this right now and see if that happens because they"
"19242870","19253530"," don't want to pay you they don't want to pay you and then the money put do they this"
"19253530","19258790"," is a this is a prime example right where we are right now is it prime prime example right here"
"19258790","19268650"," this is a this is a prime simplified answer to you how you can amplify"
"19268650","19277690"," a move down to downside yeah yeah I agree I agree with I agree limit buyer"
"19277690","19292120"," so I eat"
"19292120","19296820"," some real money selling right here dealers will fucking run all over that they will be they will be"
"19296820","19308700"," they will be with the seller slam that sell button fucking bam let's"
"19308700","19318680"," watch up 430 and 431 it's like 431 so you figure your better trade is likely more"
"19318680","19324580"," in the money right if you're gonna buy puts the closer in the money the better off you are not"
"19324580","19332560"," in calls but in puts like you don't want to be like fucking 30 40 50 delta let's see what"
"19332560","19345520"," happens here so if I was a betting man on puts I'd be trading 432 here 432"
"19345520","19378580"," is inspiring today yeah"
"19378580","19383480"," so if you're if you now understand the concept of this so if you if you don't understand a lot"
"19383480","19390360"," about gamma or delta neutral like like people say things like uh dealers have to stay delta neutral"
"19390360","19399560"," so like right now where we are they're likely delta neutral like somewhere in here right now like"
"19399560","19403140"," let's say a bunch of calls came in the market like we just started getting like millions and"
"19403140","19408700"," millions of dollars in calls we would actually dip briefly and they would take the opposite side of"
"19408700","19414880"," that trade right against you uh I've tried to explain it here in the show of the past uh I"
"19414880","19418900"," have a better way of explaining this where like you like you get this actually uh leads itself into"
"19418900","19425180"," what bag holders are so like I'm the original call buyer right I buy a shit ton of calls and"
"19425180","19431520"," uh the dealers go against me right so I have an empty bag still right I just bought a bunch"
"19431520","19435940"," of calls I bought a bunch of calls I'm like hey we're going to 450 and I have a ton"
"19435940","19441660"," of fucking money right I got fucking money from Japan I'm a big guy from Japan right so I come"
"19441660","19448560"," in and I buy a bunch of calls and uh I still have an empty bag so what do I"
"19448560","19454600"," do I'm I'm filthy rich I'm probably gonna I'm probably gonna reach out to some people on Twitter"
"19454600","19463180"," probably reach out to some contacts at a newspaper and I'm gonna let it leak that I'm buying"
"19463180","19470940"," right make that leak uh you guys know some Twitter names right they're like oh we know this is"
"19470940","19479500"," happening we know that's happening right say an empty bag now so I now need someone else to come"
"19479500","19486920"," along and buy calls for me right the dealers are now neutral against me I can't make any money so"
"19486920","19491620"," I now need to convince like two more people to buy calls and so those guys have to go out"
"19491620","19500120"," there and buy some calls right then I need like a rolling group of call buyers right and those call"
"19500120","19504520"," buyers start coming in coming in meanwhile the dealers trying to get out get neutral against all"
"19504520","19513000"," these call buyers and they can't keep up and so they end up joining with the call buyers and we"
"19513000","19516980"," start squeezing higher squeezing higher squeezing higher right going higher and higher and higher"
"19516980","19524360"," that before you know it deals with chasing with the bulls right in a bull run my bags filling up"
"19524360","19528680"," my bags filling up I try to tell you and a bunch of other people have filled that hey look"
"19528680","19534060"," look look this bag still has room in it right still room five more people believe that there's more"
"19534060","19538380"," room in it 10 more people believe there's room in it 20 more people believe there's room in it that"
"19538380","19547560"," bag is almost full and then people start going there might not be any room left in that bag right"
"19547560","19559460"," so I have to exit before you do things I"
"19559460","19569430"," do dealers exit before you do as well right and the market starts to go against you then it becomes"
"19569430","19575210"," amplified rolls over to the downside and then I'm the big guy with all this money I look for the"
"19575210","19583630"," next cheapest place to buy right squeezing off that PT2 right now"
"19583630","19590690"," sometimes you can get some insight from this too right you look at an options chain I'm looking"
