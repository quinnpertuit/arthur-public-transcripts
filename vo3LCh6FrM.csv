"6070","7790"," before the film begins."
"11500","12860"," Let's try this one again."
"107120","108180"," Let's try this again. "
"119100","120060"," What's going on?"
"120320","120900"," What's going on?"
"122940","127039"," Just some guy has gone."
"127419","128220"," Good to see you."
"128440","129460"," Deanna, good to see you. "
"129539","130000"," Stacey F."
"130140","130740"," Goats going on."
"131580","132320"," Happy Saturday."
"136830","138130"," Couple things here in the background. "
"140490","142430"," I think it's just YouTube today."
"142650","143950"," Just heads up that it's not on."
"144730","152890"," Can someone say something inside of the discord that I can't do a private show?"
"152890","154150"," I don't think. "
"154630","155470"," Maybe I can."
"157830","161310"," But I don't think that this is a chat is open to everyone."
"161650","162730"," So you do not need to be. "
"164190","165430"," Well, almost everybody."
"165430","167050"," You have to subscribe, I think, on YouTube."
"169790","170890"," Let me just make sure. "
"171190","173370"," I got to keep out the Russian bots."
"174950","178370"," Outside of that, though, everyone can chat today."
"178490","179670"," So if you are just showing up. "
"181130","182330"," Sort by newest."
"185750","187090"," Just subscribers."
"188450","189670"," Any duration, save. "
"190730","192110"," This is an update video."
"194310","197930"," We had a video, I think two Sundays ago."
"200330","203030"," Does the market have potential to roll over?"
"203970","204810"," And it did, right?"
"205530","207390"," It came down to the daily trigger. "
"210750","212150"," Say hello to everybody real quick."
"212150","212990"," Everybody get in here."
"214730","216830"," It's in the full chart here. "
"219030","221290"," Kind of like a video is."
"224150","227770"," Let's say let me go back to the talking directly to viewers."
"228030","231710"," There we go. "
"231930","235170"," Is that Chad Wilson or is that Chaz?"
"235510","235830"," I don't know."
"236090","237410"," If that's Chaz, what up Chaz?"
"237410","240370"," Hey, Chad Wilson, if you're someone different."
"241070","242590"," Just some guy was saying second. "
"243210","244250"," Dan Deanna was here."
"244370","245250"," Stacey, Kim Hill."
"246330","247950"," Dustin Bailey, what's going on?"
"248690","249890"," He's going great. "
"250290","251530"," I'm spent the morning."
"252670","253790"," I'm going to do this morning."
"254050","255810"," I got up early and. "
"257350","259850"," I went and bought a table."
"261550","262230"," Or."
"264450","267790"," RPG tabletop RPG gaming for my daughters. "
"267910","269890"," We're getting back into the school season."
"270630","273210"," And we have a spare room."
"273210","274290"," Nothing is going on in. "
"274470","274630"," So."
"275610","280890"," I bought a huge dining room table and I'm going to."
"283070","283850"," Rebuild it with. "
"284890","286190"," For tabletop games."
"286670","288490"," They play them, but they don't play them as much."
"288610","289450"," But I'm trying to get them away from. "
"290870","294470"," Gaming on the computers and Xboxes and that kind of stuff."
"294510","298010"," So we're going to level up this fall and winter."
"299530","305110"," So we're like building a recess play area and then extending the table out around. "
"305830","308410"," Should be like eight feet by six feet or something like that."
"308410","310450"," That's kind of big for them and their friends."
"311070","312330"," So I got that table this morning. "
"312530","316610"," Now my wife and children are off vacation."
"316950","317630"," Not quite vacation."
"317970","318770"," Just a day vacation. "
"319390","321530"," It took a trip across the state."
"322570","325290"," To some of my daughter's friends for a big birthday party."
"325290","327850"," And I was like, I got too much going on with these guys. "
"328990","331290"," Everybody's wondering and worrying and all that kind of stuff."
"333510","335410"," So well, I hope you're all having a great weekend."
"336210","336810"," Hi, Kim. "
"337010","337230"," How are you?"
"337510","338590"," I hope everybody's having a great weekend."
"338750","339950"," Hope you're able to get away from the market."
"340510","341570"," I know it can be a challenge. "
"342810","346990"," Funnily enough, Thursday and Friday I was busy."
"348090","353090"," And that'll bring up a topic of conversation as I did not see the clothes on Thursday."
"353850","354790"," I wish I had. "
"355070","355990"," I didn't look closely."
"356830","362730"," The crazy part was about calls on the clothes without scaling back a little bit."
"362730","365650"," I should not have, but I did. "
"365990","367510"," So we'll talk about that at some point as well."
"369290","370290"," Kim, how are you?"
"370430","371190"," Dustin Bailey."
"372410","372810"," Ash. "
"374330","375650"," Saying, oh, yeah, boy."
"376170","377070"," Well, this is out there."
"378010","379690"," Happy weekend to you too, John Haggard. "
"379690","380230"," Good to see you."
"380370","380950"," Probably for days."
"381590","382030"," It's kind of funny. "
"382330","383830"," We think you what's going on, brother."
"385090","385750"," Peter Kim."
"386010","386550"," Good to see you. "
"387290","388510"," You are different than Chas."
"388690","388890"," All right."
"388890","389110"," Cool cool. "
"389930","393270"," Some random hacker on Discord, right on run on Duck and how are you?"
"394790","399190"," We play, you know, and haven't done Pathfinder and a bunch of other games."
"399330","401430"," We do other games, but they're young."
"401830","403830"," So they love still love Dungeons and Dragons. "
"404410","411630"," Of course, I haven't told them that Wizards and had well, Hasbro's evil, of course, but we're not"
"411630","412330"," quite there yet."
"412830","415510"," So they still play Dungeons and Dragons mainly."
"416070","418030"," We do all kinds of role playing games. "
"418270","420390"," I'm like an old school gamer."
"420870","422810"," So we'll sometimes just make up games."
"423370","424110"," I do that too. "
"424450","425570"," We keep the rules simple."
"426790","429950"," We have to do a lot of role play and story making."
"430550","431570"," I don't know if it's storytelling. "
"432910","436410"," When winter comes here, it can get really dreary."
"436710","440450"," So we try to have some kind of a filler for them through the winter."
"440690","444590"," And I think this winter is going to be like, okay, we're going big time now. "
"448450","449490"," And what do we got here?"
"449670","450650"," It's kind of funny, too."
"451690","453290"," You having a problem hearing me right now?"
"453610","454890"," I'm having some issues."
"456810","458370"," I am having issues. "
"459450","460690"," A javelin glancer."
"462410","463510"," It might just be you."
"463690","467030"," I have a computer or a Windows 11 challenge. "
"467610","469710"," It just overruns anything you want to do."
"470510","472350"," It's just like fuck you are doing whatever we want."
"472470","474650"," We're just going to update this thing and we're going to reset everything. "
"474650","477850"," It does it now every month or so."
"478310","482050"," So Windows 10 is a little bit considering going back to Windows 10."
"484210","484970"," Yeah, you're welcome. "
"486670","487530"," You get some friends."
"487730","488890"," They're professionals right on, right on."
"490090","491510"," So audio is still good right on. "
"494370","496550"," Do I ever do true dungeon at Jankon?"
"496730","497190"," Would you love it?"
"497330","497670"," You would love it."
"497810","501070"," Yeah, I don't sometimes you go to icons and stuff."
"502150","505170"," I was big into when I was a kid and then I got away from it. "
"506090","511669"," And I got back into it five years ago, maybe three or four or three or five years ago."
"513429","518909"," And mostly I want my kids to have that same joy that I had when I was a kid."
"518909","522669"," I'd make comic books and write books and not really books. "
"522870","523650"," I think more comic books."
"523650","527790"," I would draw and write the stories with one of my best friends."
"528310","529690"," And my friends were still friends this day. "
"530030","534810"," I've had us in front of this now man since we were three teenage boys."
"539570","540350"," It's kind of funny."
"540770","544230"," It says here we only have 52 viewers and we're fascinatingly enough. "
"545150","550170"," We only had I think 50 or 70 viewers two Sundays ago."
"551150","555870"," And that video was kept unlisted and it actually blew up."
"556170","558910"," And I think it's got at least a couple thousand views now even more. "
"559670","562630"," So you're here for the second part of that video."
"563050","568710"," It's good to see those of you that are here because I can see that this market matters to you."
"570130","573150"," And then you don't come back to it later or after it comes true and that kind of stuff. "
"573510","575430"," So we'll get this show started now."
"579810","581230"," So John's in the chat right now."
"581630","582850"," Let me see if I can do that right now. "
"582990","583250"," Hang tight."
"584810","585410"," Where's John?"
"585650","586410"," Oh, there's John Lynch."
"586630","586930"," Hold on here. "
"586950","587590"," I'll do that right now."
"587670","588230"," Give me a second here."
"602270","604050"," So we make him a managing moderator. "
"604530","610530"," So John, you've got a little bit more power than the moderators that are there."
"610830","611690"," Just a heads up to that."
"611850","613010"," So don't be fucking hitting buttons. "
"616710","619530"," If you ever jump on too much, I'll make you one there as well."
"623220","623680"," Yeah."
"624300","626560"," And I do with my kids too. "
"626840","631140"," So there's a part of this where they're reading and writing."
"631920","633020"," They're being creative."
"633860","634360"," Then we do. "
"635040","638800"," We make art or crafts together."
"639300","644740"," So we'll build three dimensional scenes and we'll paint."
"645540","646120"," Miniatures. "
"646860","651000"," And we use some good graphing skills and stuff like that."
"651660","660300"," But the cool part about this is they're able to use their imaginations and open up their world of"
"660300","662400"," imagination and fantasy."
"663200","667860"," And even myself as they get older, I noticed that I lose some of that. "
"669100","677780"," As I'm getting older, I'm losing that ability to dream and fantasize and have all these crazy wacky"
"677780","678040"," thoughts."
"678560","682260"," You know, it's like something about this is similar to Mad Libs."
"682380","684740"," If you've ever played Mad Libs, very simple game. "
"685760","687040"," We fill in the blanks."
"688040","689720"," And you start to tell a story, right?"
"689940","692180"," When you tell that story, it's kind of funny and you're rolling off."
"692360","693480"," The tears rolling out of your eyes. "
"694420","696840"," None of these, none of these words are fit."
"696840","702520"," And of course, it brings images into your mind that you are not normal, right?"
"704180","706380"," Like I have tomato toes or something."
"707080","708660"," It's a little tomatoes on my toes. "
"709340","718100"," And it kind of triggers the mind into thinking about situations and actions and just descriptions"
"718980","720380"," of things that are kind of weird."
"720560","724060"," So just trying to keep their minds going like that."
"724060","726660"," That's kind of an important thing for a kid. "
"728860","729640"," I'm for children."
"730780","733680"," If I did mod John L, obviously we got here."
"735220","736600"," What are the books behind me?"
"736880","737580"," I've got a bunch of them. "
"737680","740400"," There are mostly books that I've read that have to do with trading."
"741300","745140"," The ones this year that I thought were most important was hedge fund market wizards."
"746420","753660"," That book talks a lot about being able to see a bottom, a major bottom in the stock market. "
"753660","755240"," And the players in that."
"755900","758400"," Another one is the education of a speculator over here."
"758960","768640"," And that's a famous trader who causes a lot of strife amongst professionals, professional"
"768640","769740"," traders. "
"770720","772820"," Either really like him or really hate him."
"773220","775660"," He's very honest in his life."
"775940","781780"," He wears his career on his sleeve and doesn't make any bones about it. "
"783120","788880"," So it gives a matter of fact, he's still alive and he's active on Twitter, near Hoffer."
"789120","791480"," And he's actually posts every day."
"791880","794580"," He's an active poster on Fintuit to this day. "
"795020","796940"," There's no ton of followers anymore."
"797220","798220"," He's grown a lot this year."
"798360","799940"," He went from like, I push him all the time on Twitter. "
"800960","802720"," But he's got a great market insight."
"803420","808340"," And a lot of the market still relies upon guys like that."
"808340","811680"," The guys like that have made fortunes and lost them and made them again. "
"812460","817960"," So he gives a great perspective on being on his trader."
"818320","822480"," A lot of today, we miss some of that today in the markets."
"822760","826180"," There's a veil over the markets that everyone is perfect. "
"826700","830500"," And guys like him or not and never tried to be publicly."
"832400","833900"," I've got some other books back here."
"833900","840540"," I've got this one here read for writing algorithms and stuff. "
"841240","843080"," I wanted to give this away because I've read it already."
"843540","845260"," And I think I went as deep as I could in it."
"845780","847180"," It's an expensive book too. "
"847400","848860"," Matter of fact, I still owe."
"851080","854280"," I paid one."
"854280","856320"," I paid one. "
"857400","858400"," I paid one."
"859120","860980"," Would someone want to challenge or something?"
"861160","862560"," I paid one guy and I was like, not dope."
"863140","863980"," Still haven't sent. "
"864200","865660"," I got to send this last gift out here."
"866480","868680"," So probably I'll do that today or Monday."
"869360","870620"," So make sure I get that out to somebody. "
"871660","874340"," I promise I would give that book away to having it."
"874400","877340"," So maybe we'll do the next challenge for that book there."
"877440","885540"," If anyone's interested in pathways, neural pathways in the 1960s and 1970s. "
"886440","888520"," Mathematicians were trying to develop."
"888520","890380"," This was the computers that are coming online."
"891640","900780"," And scientists were trying to figure out how to relay information"
"900780","908300"," amongst blind people and deaf people so that they could have adaptive"
"908300","914260"," devices that would be able to transmit information. "
"914260","921540"," And a lot of those math equations were then picked up by Wall Street."
"923820","928140"," And that's how we actually got indicators like the RSI indicator."
"928780","931460"," Indicators like that came out in VWAP. "
"931620","935200"," All these things started to be developed and came out in the 70s and 80s."
"935940","940040"," On Wall Street, then they were sold to the general public in the late 80s, early 90s."
"940040","949880"," And matter of fact, a lot of that base research is now being used for AI today. "
"950460","955800"," AI is kind of foundational aspects of AI and machine learning and stuff like that."
"956160","959600"," So yeah, good to see everybody here."
"960120","960220"," Okay. "
"962400","963940"," Group called the Indiana Castle."
"964240","965740"," They put together professional gyms and castles."
"965740","967320"," I did the inaugural one in France. "
"967320","968600"," That sounds like a blast."
"970740","971420"," Oh, no way."
"971700","973220"," I didn't know that he was livestreaming right now. "
"973400","975140"," Maybe we'll end the livestream and come back later."
"976060","976840"," I had no idea."
"977220","978280"," I made this plan. "
"978400","978620"," I don't know."
"978680","980300"," I made plans to do this I think yesterday."
"981380","987660"," I think I told the admins yesterday at some point it's on private admin discord that we have. "
"988300","989920"," So I had no idea that he was livestreaming."
"991120","992300"," And congratulations to him."
"992360","992980"," I love Brian Watt. "
"993580","994340"," Guy is awesome."
"998270","1000130"," Hey, I discussed the NQ Day trades right on."
"1001650","1002990"," I love Brian Watt, by the way. "
"1003270","1004970"," He's a matter of fact, I'm a student of his."
"1005150","1008290"," I spent years watching his live streams day in day out."
"1008450","1009090"," Guy is amazing. "
"1010830","1015490"," So we're going to talk about and this update here as to what's going on in the marketplace."
"1015870","1017410"," We're going to continue on here."
"1018090","1021450"," It's because I'm sure people are going to watch this later and be like the first 45 minutes. "
"1021450","1022530"," The answer is just bullshitting."
"1024250","1027170"," Yeah, I feel bad now."
"1027270","1031369"," I kind of feel bad like maybe I should end the livestream and come back later or something. "
"1032030","1034190"," Because I don't want to take away from him live streaming."
"1034470","1035329"," He's like the goat, right?"
"1035730","1041609"," And if anything, you should watch him and come back here and then watch my weekend broadcast here."
"1041810","1042650"," I feel like all you guys this. "
"1042910","1044849"," So here we go."
"1044950","1045950"," I'm going to get through it really quick."
"1045950","1047550"," Try to get this done as fast. "
"1047569","1052830"," I actually have another meeting too with John Allen, someone else after this broadcast."
"1053190","1054270"," But I feel like I owe you this."
"1055890","1060790"," As we had this, we had this little private livestream last week. "
"1062130","1064290"," And we talked about two weeks ago."
"1064430","1065650"," Two weeks on a Sunday or something like that."
"1065750","1067630"," So let's see where we are on the charts here. "
"1068530","1070470"," This is Friday, right?"
"1071870","1075370"," Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday, Monday."
"1075370","1082030"," And then we had Friday, Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday, Monday."
"1082930","1086630"," So right in here, right up in here, right up in here somewhere. "
"1087270","1094170"," We did a livestream and said, you know, don't be surprised if you wake up on next week, week after"
"1094170","1098390"," or even any time coming up as we as we start to hit the top."
"1099530","1105350"," But you expect a pullback and it can get violent as, well, the general gist is it can get violent"
"1105350","1107350"," as we move up to all time eyes."
"1108190","1117530"," Now we did bounce off of the daily trigger here and held the daily trigger quite nicely until"
"1117530","1118050"," Thursday. "
"1119170","1125110"," But we want to talk to you guys about Thursday and we had that squeeze on Thursday."
"1125790","1131150"," So I had a bunch of calls here that I bought on this close right here."
"1131170","1133550"," I bought a bunch of calls for Thursday. "
"1134770","1137410"," I think we're Friday in for next week or something like that."
"1137650","1140770"," Took a bunch of money off the table for Friday here."
"1141690","1146210"," As we came up here, you guys was on stream with you as I took the money and ran up"
"1146210","1146550"," in here. "
"1146710","1151290"," And I was like, yeah, we come back down to this hourly trigger by that dip, right?"
"1152170","1154850"," You want to be buying that hourly trigger down here?"
"1155110","1156430"," Hourly was curled up too."
"1157470","1161550"," As a matter of fact, just looking back on it right here, you can actually see the candle that it"
"1161550","1162110"," happened on."
"1162830","1164190"," It's a 30 minute try right now. "
"1164890","1167710"," And you could see a nice beautiful trade higher."
"1168190","1174770"," You have the hourly trade up came back down and actually we had initial bounce right here on this"
"1174770","1175070"," candle."
"1175770","1178630"," But then we sold and broke through the hourly trigger. "
"1178630","1182830"," As soon as that happened, all that's wore off."
"1183770","1189850"," When we have trades on the hourly trigger, it's a bull you're looking for that bounce."
"1191110","1197190"," So 30 minute candles, any bounces off, any kind of like rip take off on the hourly trigger, daily"
"1197190","1199970"," trigger, one minute five and all those things, they're great. "
"1200170","1201310"," They make great money off of them."
"1202090","1209370"," But you are looking for that confirmation off of that hourly for continuation to the upside to"
"1209370","1210790"," begin to get bullish."
"1211730","1214990"," So you're not actually bullish here, right?"
"1215430","1216710"," You don't actually get bullish. "
"1217490","1223450"," Specifically the past three or four weeks I've been trying to bring this up to people."
"1223790","1231030"," It's called a kiss trade, but what you're looking for is this confirmation trade on the hourly"
"1231030","1235390"," trigger to get actually bullish for continuation of the upside."
"1235390","1239010"," And this is actually when a take off becomes bullish. "
"1239010","1240490"," So the initial squeeze, not bullish."
"1240910","1241770"," Great way to make money."
"1242130","1249350"," But if you're like, hey, I've got a bullish thesis to the upside, it's been confirmed. "
"1250250","1251330"," This would be the trade."
"1251750","1257130"," And you know, you even have to enter this until way later on up here and not having that on"
"1258050","1267750"," Thursday's close was a key signal that we would lose the daily trigger up here."
"1268110","1272250"," And on a 30 minute chart, specifically, I don't like to see closing. "
"1272590","1275130"," Never like to see closing candles."
"1275530","1276290"," Just like that in here."
"1276410","1277210"," Don't like to see them. "
"1278470","1282170"," And on Friday, things got even nastier."
"1282330","1284670"," On Friday, we actually lost the daily trigger."
"1285410","1289330"," So we lost it on Thursday, confirmed the loss on the close on Thursday. "
"1290530","1295050"," And I actually bought, I think it was Friday."
"1295790","1301270"," I ended up buying, I ended up buying a bunch of a call, no, not Thursday."
"1301630","1302110"," Excuse me. "
"1302190","1308010"," On Thursday, on this close right here, I wound up buying more calls for next Friday."
"1308310","1313450"," I think there were 13 cents or something like that for next Friday to go up."
"1313450","1315990"," And then I didn't pay attention to the charts on Friday. "
"1316470","1319830"," Had I paid up much, I got here on Friday actually in the stream."
"1320370","1322790"," I was able to get on and type some stuff into you guys."
"1322970","1324910"," And I was like, yeah, they're going to squeeze this up into this close. "
"1325470","1327330"," They held it down to the close instead."
"1328050","1329870"," But we should be going up on Monday."
"1330830","1331910"," But not for long. "
"1332630","1334230"," I'm not expecting it to go up for long."
"1334470","1338210"," I'm going to walk around the market and show you guys the thought process here."
"1338630","1343350"," And we're at an inflection point, a true inflection point in the market right now. "
"1343350","1348930"," We're in a cusp of being dragged down to that 428, 432."
"1350730","1353890"," So the market needs to reverse quickly."
"1354270","1358410"," Now, there are some sectors saying we are going to reverse to the upside. "
"1358410","1362250"," And there are some sectors that are saying, no, we have some gaps still to close below."
"1363170","1366570"," I think at 443, 20 and 422, 86."
"1367650","1370950"," Somewhere in there, there was a gap way, way, way back from last year that still hasn't been"
"1370950","1371190"," closed. "
"1371190","1376250"," I think we hit one of the two, but not the second one on the downside on Spy."
"1377130","1381750"," But for right now, Thursday and Friday was not what you want to see."
"1382050","1387590"," You do not want to see the daily trend rolling over, which is what we're seeing right now. "
"1388210","1393750"," And I would expect any up move on Monday if there's any kind of squeeze to get sold down."
"1394050","1398610"," And we're eventually going to or likely going to go down and trade that weekly trigger."
"1399370","1406130"," And that is down here at, that is down here at, let me put a little box down here. "
"1409460","1417400"," Next week will be roughly this 428 to 432, somewhere here the next two weeks that takes to hit"
"1417400","1417620"," this."
"1418300","1421760"," So we are looking to trade at this point."
"1421800","1423140"," We've lost the daily trigger. "
"1423880","1426120"," This is a signpost for the market."
"1426120","1430060"," And I do expect us to be having an update on Monday."
"1430240","1432880"," And let's just start seeing some real recovery. "
"1433380","1435060"," Like if you're a bull out there, right?"
"1435200","1437740"," And you're like, hey, we're probably going to close that small gap."
"1438060","1440020"," We're going to head higher from there cap."
"1440540","1441460"," There's no worries here. "
"1441880","1447500"," The only thing that I would say to you would be that on Monday, now you have to not only"
"1447500","1451100"," regain 44773 on Monday."
"1451870","1458000"," But then you must, you must bounce off the hourly, confirm the hourly to go higher."
"1459080","1461420"," So bulls have a ton of work here. "
"1461580","1465120"," They have to regain this yellow here."
"1468290","1472490"," Well, the work bulls have is no joke here."
"1472910","1477250"," Talking about that yellow line right there, you're talking about this green line of having to come"
"1477250","1478430"," up as well. "
"1478430","1480770"," And you have to break above it with price."
"1481430","1485750"," Come back down, likely test both of these twice and then start to make your way higher."
"1486390","1486990"," Is it possible?"
"1487590","1488090"," It is possible. "
"1488730","1493070"," But as time is passing here, bulls are not showing the will to do this."
"1493610","1496570"," You saw economic news come out that was not negative."
"1497830","1501310"," No matter what you say, it's not negative enough to drop the market. "
"1501430","1503010"," Market is still stair-casing down."
"1503670","1510030"," You're also noticing sentiment in the marketplace right now is starting to wane to the downside."
"1511210","1517870"," I'm even going to see it publicly and see it on Twitter, see it on all the news stations that"
"1517870","1519650"," there's a little bit of skepticism here. "
"1519870","1524710"," And I'm seeing that, and most of this isn't the, this sentiment isn't from retailers."
"1525610","1531070"," The sentiment is from banks telling you, and maybe you should start looking at all these nice"
"1531070","1533470"," stocks over here, like Walmart's and shit."
"1533630","1535430"," And I'm like, oh man, this isn't good. "
"1535430","1542270"," You don't want to, you don't want to see retailers take that sentiment on, which they're going to,"
"1542270","1544090"," if it's being fed to you."
"1544450","1550270"," So there is a sentiment shift, which I believe a lot in sentiments out there that maybe we're not"
"1550270","1550850"," going any higher."
"1551450","1553070"," Now, the bulls aren't out of this yet. "
"1553610","1554950"," So we're going to talk about that right now."
"1556110","1558550"," But I do want to give you an update that for right now."
"1559170","1560870"," We're in an inflection point in the market. "
"1560870","1564290"," Daily velocity is coming down to the zero line right now."
"1565310","1566950"," And sometimes we'll break below it."
"1567030","1570010"," We'll go like minus five, minus ten, and then you'll get your bounce up. "
"1570110","1572630"," And I'm going to talk to you about how that can happen in a moment here."
"1572770","1576390"," But right now we're at a neutral point in the market."
"1576650","1583550"," Even though we've broken the daily trigger, this thing is for, is a forward indicator, a forward"
"1583550","1585670"," looking indicator, not a lagging indicator. "
"1586250","1589690"," And it's starting to say, hey, you know what, we broke the daily trigger."
"1589690","1592370"," We are going to begin to look to the downside."
"1593270","1597250"," And VIX is kind of telling us that same thing, VIX is drawing that same kind of a picture. "
"1598230","1603610"," Now, the idea here, the expectation here is that on Monday we're going to squeeze higher and"
"1603610","1607070"," actually reject and confirm that move lower."
"1608050","1613750"," If we begin to do a rejection trade here, you're going to be looking out to the downside."
"1614790","1617050"," Now, just like bulls, right, I want to show you this here. "
"1617630","1621690"," Just like bulls right here, this is a key point for bears, okay?"
"1622150","1627530"," And I tell bulls this all the time, and I want to explain this to you, just like I explained"
"1627530","1628530"," it a moment ago."
"1629050","1633350"," When we come up like when price comes up, right, you're looking for that confirmation on the hourly"
"1633350","1635170"," for true bullishness."
"1636250","1637990"," Right here is true bullishness, right?"
"1638650","1639450"," Confirm on the hourly. "
"1639750","1642630"," Has not happened once in any of this consolidation here."
"1642630","1647410"," And bears are looking for that same confirmation to the downside."
"1647770","1649910"," It's not good enough that you break down over here. "
"1649990","1650830"," I'm going to change this to a red."
"1651370","1654330"," So if you're a bear and you're like watching this and you're like, oh hell yeah, let's go to the"
"1654330","1654730"," depths of hell."
"1655650","1657370"," It's still not done yet, right?"
"1657830","1659690"," See, you can't, this isn't going to work here. "
"1659790","1665890"," You need to have one more squeeze up here and just be just be saying, yes, we're going down, okay?"
"1665890","1673570"," So if you're a bear out there, you are looking on Monday, or at some point Monday Tuesday for some"
"1673570","1678890"," kind of a test at 4.47, we're going to go with 4.47 flat, okay?"
"1679290","1682830"," So you're going to be looking, bears are looking for hard rejection."
"1684010","1685950"," I'm just going to draw that in for you."
"1686530","1692230"," Hard rejection down here at about 4.47 flat right here. "
"1694110","1696730"," Bears are definitely going to be looking for that."
"1697070","1698010"," I'm just going to get that in there."
"1698970","1704710"," Bears are definitely looking for some kind of rejection here on Monday for that downside move. "
"1705390","1709410"," And I would expect that that, I'm going to expect at that point that we are going to target down"
"1709410","1714610"," here to that 4.32. We'll talk about that right now if we get that rejection, what to do, that"
"1714610","1718910"," kind of stuff is the run all over, is the bull run all over at that point."
"1718910","1720970"," That's possible that it would be."
"1721270","1727710"," It's possible if we trade that 4.32, even if we stay in trend, that the actual bull run might"
"1727710","1737430"," be over for that target of failing all time highs into September, and then the 4.84 new"
"1737430","1742190"," years, and then the role of the eventual role over in February. "
"1742190","1745050"," So, inflection point time right here, right?"
"1745230","1748830"," That's kind of like stating inflection point in the market."
"1749030","1750830"," None of this is inflection point here."
"1751050","1754730"," This now is confirmed inflection point. "
"1754910","1760210"," If we begin to trade down here to this 4.32, we're going to get over into the JPM caller"
"1760210","1762370"," really quick and take a peek at this."
"1763770","1766230"," I'm going to explain the rest of this to you right now."
"1766230","1773290"," I want to show you the idea here between behind if we are going to have continuation to the upside"
"1773290","1775830"," of this bull run or not, right?"
"1775990","1778830"," We've got the danger or we've got the hey danger head is coming. "
"1779590","1784090"," Don't be surprised if you wake up and we have a down markets, right?"
"1784430","1787130"," Don't be scared of that down move, how violent it can get."
"1787870","1792230"," And I want to point your attention to this one white bar right here, right?"
"1792230","1793230"," First month is over."
"1793410","1798370"," I want to pay your pay attention to this white bar here of the last JPM caller. "
"1798890","1804730"," And these are the targets of the last JPM caller here and there's one way lower down there."
"1805630","1811250"," So, let's look at the past of the previous JPM caller and we had some weakness down here, right?"
"1811430","1814670"," But it was bought right back up like it was nothing, right?"
"1814910","1818510"," And we have that continuation move higher into the end of the second month."
"1819130","1825190"," Okay, and we are in that second month currently right now and we're right at that same place. "
"1825190","1827030"," Do you see that move down right here?"
"1827090","1832650"," I want to point your attention to the same thing right here, okay?"
"1834170","1837010"," Let me see and get rid of some of this stuff so just so I can get rid of this."
"1837010","1839770"," Make sure you guys can understand where I'm coming from and get rid of some of this crap here."
"1841410","1845510"," Okay, so we got this nice right come right into the first part of this month, right?"
"1845510","1847750"," Bounce right off and what are we doing?"
"1847750","1849590"," We're off and running, right?"
"1849690","1854690"," We actually slam into the top of that JPM caller, right?"
"1854950","1860010"," Get above it and hold it right into the end of that quarter. "
"1860570","1862990"," And we're at that inflection point right now."
"1863270","1865550"," I want you to see this because I'm just going to bring this down."
"1866250","1871570"," I want you to see this inflection point right here, right?"
"1871570","1877550"," Came down this inflection point and nope, right back up like nobody's business, right?"
"1877750","1880470"," Slam right up into that top end of that caller. "
"1880710","1885610"," It's like a magnet and we actually end up pinning into it into the end of that quarter."
"1885970","1889110"," And right up here we've got this next one right here, right?"
"1889310","1893810"," We're at that same inflection point right at the beginning of the month."
"1894250","1900750"," It's now the 8th of August and it's kind of do or die for the market here. "
"1900750","1906210"," And this is what I really want to point out to you is if the market does not reverse quickly,"
"1906610","1908490"," quickly, right?"
"1908970","1915610"," To begin to attempt to trade the end of the quarter on the top end of this JPM caller because"
"1915610","1918090"," this will, this is the axis of an attractor believe it or not."
"1918450","1920130"," It's like a magnet."
"1920530","1923230"," It's like a tractor beam, this JPM caller. "
"1923930","1925330"," It's like, believe it or not, it's like a tractor beam."
"1926090","1928670"," And it's, if we get up here, right?"
"1928890","1934130"," We can usually get above it and then slam down into, and of course, something like this."
"1934310","1941290"," Now, if we begin to have a continuation of the downside, you're going to get a magnet down into end"
"1941290","1944950"," of month to this JPM caller and a pinning action to this. "
"1945390","1952050"," Sometimes we can actually come down, but this will act as a, not as a magnet, but as a pushing"
"1952050","1952710"," away force."
"1953210","1960950"," It'll attempt to, the market will attempt to actually push us up and back into the middle of this"
"1960950","1964770"," market for September 29th."
"1965310","1969710"," So this is a 421, 4210 long puts, right?"
"1970470","1972270"," Coming into the mark, coming into September. "
"1972610","1979230"," So you're at this point right now in the caller where we're not quite attracted to either are we?"
"1979230","1984010"," We're not quite, we're not quite there yet to the downside."
"1984170","1985910"," We're not quite there yet to the upside."
"1987190","1991050"," But I am going to have a price, we have a price target of 432, 428. "
"1992090","1998130"," So in turn of quarter, if we do begin to reject off this daily trigger, we have right now a"
"1998130","1999570"," target of 42432."
"1999750","2006630"," The actual target should be roughly that 421, 0 on the, on the caller down here."
"2006630","2010710"," So keep this on your plate here for the rest of the quarter. "
"2011290","2016750"," This will act as a magnet if we begin to slip and reject that daily trigger."
"2019680","2021500"," Let me see what some of you guys are asking right now."
"2028260","2029420"," Let me see what you guys are saying. "
"2029580","2030840"," I just think I have a bunch of questions here."
"2034640","2038040"," 359 or so downturn within next trading days."
"2039780","2041580"," Yeah, I'm on the surge for next week. "
"2041840","2045580"," I don't think, I don't think, I got to talk to both sellers and buyers here."
"2045580","2050120"," It's usually, the S&P 500 is way more resilient than tech."
"2050340","2050940"," Let's start with that. "
"2051159","2055260"," And spec growth, S&P 500 is very resilient."
"2056340","2059520"," And you can see that right now, verse and queue, right?"
"2059960","2061239"," We'll look at NQ here in just a moment."
"2061920","2067300"," But just be aware that you should see at least one more like death. "
"2068159","2071940"," When you're selling right, it's hard to sell a bull."
"2073199","2078320"," Even if we are going to sell this, you're going to see like one more death row to the upside"
"2078320","2080159"," before the bulls get drowned."
"2081159","2083100"," We talk about it here all the time, right?"
"2084300","2090020"," That when you're trying to sell a bull, you get these monster squeezes to the upside and you have"
"2090020","2091719"," to slam them back down again, right?"
"2092739","2096580"," And so I'm going to expect at least one more surge this week. "
"2097320","2100160"," And we're going to go through some of the sectors right now, take a look at that stuff."
"2100160","2102280"," We're going to go through some cycle rotation stuff as well."
"2102800","2110640"," I'm going to show you guys some PPOs, PPMs, sector rotation stuff right now, and some good stuff"
"2110640","2111200"," for the bulls. "
"2111640","2112880"," But just a note to this."
"2113320","2118920"," I want you to be aware of this, that if there is that rejection on that daily trigger, watch out."
"2119180","2120980"," So right here, I'm going to switch over here. "
"2121540","2125000"," This is like a key thing here for bulls and bears."
"2125000","2131840"," Bears are looking for that rejection on Monday here, like slam it down, stand underneath the daily"
"2131840","2137560"," triggers, get the hourly rolling down, all that kind of stuff, and bears are doing it."
"2137720","2140360"," Thursday was the day. "
"2140800","2142480"," We came back down that hourly trigger."
"2142700","2143560"," We lost that hourly trigger."
"2144480","2146200"," It was gone for bulls. "
"2146560","2148440"," Bulls have lost their will to go to the upside."
"2149280","2152880"," Now, saying that, saying that really quick here."
"2152880","2153840"," Hold on a second here. "
"2156020","2157160"," Saying that really quick."
"2158540","2159320"," XLF, right?"
"2159700","2164340"," When I'm looking at XLF here, XLF on a daily chart is looking pretty bullish here, right?"
"2165020","2167580"," This is not showing a weak market here."
"2168280","2170820"," I always like to see XLF. "
"2170960","2172640"," This is a daily chart right now in XLF."
"2173880","2176120"," The XLF chart looks fine."
"2177240","2184620"," If we have time, we'll get to Dr. Copper and we'll get to XLK, or we'll look at XLK and"
"2184620","2186000"," XLC here in a moment too. "
"2186480","2187440"," Let's look at XLF."
"2188100","2197140"," If we are having these pullbacks, I'm expecting XLF to look as bearish as spy, right on this"
"2197140","2197620"," pullback."
"2197800","2198980"," We'll look at it here as well. "
"2200920","2203180"," You like the underlying health of the markets?"
"2204180","2206340"," XLF is looking pretty strong here."
"2206760","2207860"," I want you to see this here."
"2208680","2211180"," XLF is bounced off of its daily trigger. "
"2212160","2213480"," It's confirmed once."
"2213720","2214560"," It's confirmed twice."
"2215000","2220220"," Prices above the hourly, the half hour, the daily. "
"2221080","2223140"," This is showing the underside."
"2227240","2228520"," He will break his toes releasing there."
"2228620","2230140"," We can replace the dollar currency plan. "
"2230720","2233320"," Yeah, I'm more focused on."
"2234020","2236380"," Do you guys understand the JPM collar?"
"2236720","2238560"," Do you guys have an understanding of..."
"2238560","2241280"," If you guys want me to go over that briefly with you so that you can..."
"2241280","2242900"," A basic understanding for you."
"2243320","2245080"," I know it seems..."
"2245080","2247820"," I know that people use big words with the JPM collar. "
"2248460","2250040"," Do you want me to go over that briefly in this?"
"2250480","2254360"," Do you want me to go over how the market actually runs, whether you know it or not?"
"2254920","2255900"," I can if you want."
"2256240","2257020"," Let me know in the chat."
"2257320","2263660"," If anyone here is mystified by how the JPM collar works, let me know and I'll try to spend 10"
"2263660","2264220"," minutes on it. "
"2266690","2268250"," I don't have to, but I can."
"2269670","2272390"," I think it's just rotation from tech into financials."
"2272850","2274190"," Well, I'm going to tell you this. "
"2275030","2277050"," Like Dr. Kaver can tell you some stuff."
"2277290","2280570"," XLK, XLC can tell you if there's risk on the market or not."
"2281150","2286450"," But the underlying health of the market, I assure you, is financials. "
"2286570","2292330"," If you start to see financials rip and blast down, getting ugly in financials, the market is sure"
"2292330","2292610"," to..."
"2292610","2295530"," The market at all is short to follow."
"2296650","2299690"," And XLF, to me, is extremely bullish here."
"2299870","2304990"," So even though we're saying, yeah, we could correct or, yeah, we could trade 4.32. I'm like, yeah,"
"2305010","2309150"," but there's some other sectors out there that are saying, wait a minute, we're not done here. "
"2312240","2315520"," We're mystified by everything Jamie Dogg says."
"2316060","2317300"," Well, so there's..."
"2317300","2318360"," Let me see if I can get this down."
"2318600","2320580"," I usually write this down before I talk about it. "
"2320600","2322620"," But let's talk about the collar really quick."
"2323460","2325760"," Why the collar actually does matter."
"2327240","2332560"," Assuming I can get this out really quick so that you can understand them, or demystify it for you. "
"2335460","2336260"," I'll be quick."
"2336820","2337760"," I'll be really quick."
"2341170","2343530"," Okay, so you have..."
"2344170","2344770"," Let me see..."
"2344770","2349630"," I might have my numbers wrong right now, but let me see if I can type this out. "
"2349850","2351330"," Basically explain it to you."
"2351330","2354990"," So you have about 30..."
"2354990","2357310"," 35% of the market is retail."
"2359550","2360830"," And about..."
"2360830","2364150"," I want to say 35% percent is about..."
"2364150","2364510"," is retail. "
"2365850","2369550"," Nine to 12% of it is dealers."
"2370490","2371810"," So now you're up to what?"
"2372130","2373070"," 45%, 50%."
"2374070","2382250"," You've got some individual big players, banks, institutions, and funds that are about..."
"2382250","2387550"," Somewhere between what I've been told is 45 and 55%. "
"2387550","2390090"," Depending on who's in the pool."
"2390950","2395470"," Who's in and out of the pool in the marketplace at any time."
"2396050","2400650"," So if you're someone that's one of the bigger players, if you're like a black rock, supposedly"
"2400650","2408330"," black rock in State Street, own 80% of the market, believe it or not, at any one time. "
"2408530","2411890"," State Street, Black Rock, and I don't think it's..."
"2411890","2413490"," JPM is even smaller than those guys."
"2415960","2419100"," But basically big banks, right, own the market."
"2419340","2422420"," Now, saying that, right?"
"2424220","2427340"," These medium-sized banks, let's call them..."
"2427340","2430000"," You've got like the six eyes, the seven eyes. "
"2430920","2435100"," Those are the guys, those are like the Bond vigilantes."
"2435100","2438000"," Those kind of guys, they can actually do damage in the marketplace."
"2438620","2442280"," But generally speaking, you have these different entities in the marketplace. "
"2442700","2448240"," I mean, if you don't understand this stuff, basically you've got banks, you've got dealers, and"
"2448240","2450500"," you've got retailers, basically."
"2451380","2454360"," There's different kinds of groups within that, but you need to know that."
"2454820","2459320"," And you'll hear things like real money selling and real money buying. "
"2460680","2468140"," When you hear that, right, it's referring to these large positional players, mostly banks."
"2468620","2473420"," If they're selling or buying, they can force price."
"2474340","2477020"," So where price goes can be..."
"2477600","2482540"," The termination of price can be determined by the largest players in the pool, right?"
"2483040","2487220"," If I'm doing all the buying and driving the price up, if people know that I'm buying, it becomes"
"2487220","2490160"," public that I'm buying, prices will get driven up. "
"2490160","2495500"," If they find out that I'm selling it on a major player, prices will go down, right?"
"2495920","2502720"," Whatever I'm done doing those things, whatever me as a large player is done, the market can kind of"
"2502720","2504540"," do whatever it wants to do."
"2505380","2508400"," And that's usually where retailers step in."
"2509100","2511760"," And so retailers will step in, and they're mostly bullish. "
"2512260","2514180"," They'll mostly drive the market up, generally speaking."
"2514820","2521260"," Unless you change their sentiment to bearish, like if you scare, create sentiment to the downside,"
"2521940","2526180"," you'll get an amplification effect if I'm a larger player selling."
"2526980","2528760"," I'll have retailers join me. "
"2528880","2534100"," I can do that by changing sentiment by going on CNBC, going to Bloomberg News, all that kind of"
"2534100","2534280"," stuff."
"2534900","2537420"," So when you hear that stuff, there's an impact on that."
"2537600","2542200"," When I'm real money selling and I can impact retailers doing that, I can control the market, and I"
"2542200","2543640"," can also overrun dealers. "
"2544340","2550120"," Now, if I'm a big player and I'm not buying or selling, dealers take over with retailers."
"2550940","2556080"," And if retailers are buying and selling, usually dealers will have an impact on those retailers."
"2556480","2562900"," You'll see them counter hedging whatever the sentiment is of a small money pushing the market"
"2562900","2563220"," around. "
"2564280","2569860"," And sometimes they'll actually chase dealers will end up having to chase if larger players in the"
"2569860","2572940"," market are found out to be buying or selling, right?"
"2573100","2577720"," Rather than delta hedging against that trade, they end up having to follow that trade and they can"
"2577720","2579220"," amplify a move lower."
"2579860","2581520"," Now, we know these things, right?"
"2582040","2584960"," Now, a bank doesn't even like that."
"2585300","2586320"," They don't like that. "
"2587400","2589980"," Banks don't like price discovery in the marketplace."
"2591340","2597820"," So banks put their fingers on the marketplace secretly in the background and they do it with"
"2597820","2598500"," collars."
"2598760","2600340"," They do it with more than just collars. "
"2600480","2604800"," There are other strategies that are actually better to use."
"2604980","2609820"," But a lot of these big players, what they're trying to do is kill vol on the marketplace up or"
"2609820","2610180"," down."
"2610700","2614940"," So they have a secondary effect on the market when they're not buying or selling. "
"2615540","2617460"," And a lot of that is through hedging."
"2617700","2625700"," So if you're a large bank, you don't want to tell your clients that you have wild returns, right?"
"2625920","2626660"," The market's going crazy."
"2626700","2628020"," I had a great month, great month. "
"2628420","2630240"," Then I had two bad months, then a great month."
"2630240","2631540"," Two bad months."
"2631700","2633880"," They don't like markets that are volatile. "
"2634400","2641200"," Generally speaking, banks like markets that trade sideways end up with pullbacks every once, or"
"2641200","2643680"," major pullbacks once or twice a year, some volatility."
"2644880","2646980"," Let's call it three times max in a year."
"2647840","2651760"," And then a major pullback over time, and then start the process all over again, right?"
"2651920","2652140"," To the upside. "
"2653360","2659480"," So if I'm a bank and I have institutional clients, I've got clients all around the world and I say"
"2659480","2665680"," to myself, what am I going to do to stop price volatility once I'm done buying or selling this"
"2665680","2665900"," market?"
"2666320","2666800"," I'm going to hedge it."
"2667360","2673340"," And not only am I going to hedge it, but other smaller institutions, smaller players, and some of"
"2673340","2679800"," retail are going to follow that hedging of the marketplace because there's a belief that we're"
"2679800","2680720"," going to go to those numbers."
"2681660","2688000"," So what happens is, when they put this hedging on the market, it actually limits volatility. "
"2688280","2692760"," Or the thesis is that it limits volatility in the marketplace."
"2693380","2702320"," So when we have a hedge in the market, it tends to stop us from going too high, right?"
"2702800","2703500"," Crazy high."
"2703720","2705680"," This is the top here, right?"
"2706020","2707860"," And crazy low to the downside. "
"2709180","2712460"," Kind of limits our trading range where we should be trading."
"2713140","2714220"," Now can they get run over?"
"2714220","2714880"," Absolutely."
"2715240","2716160"," Have they ever been run over?"
"2716460","2717620"," Absolutely they have. "
"2718640","2720320"," But normally not."
"2720600","2726680"," And normally they are able to actually control how much upside we have and how much downside"
"2726680","2730240"," potential there is to the marketplace."
"2731140","2734780"," And so it's like a second or third layer, I guess, on price discovery. "
"2735360","2739940"," So as we're trading, when you see me say things like, I want to see where the collar is, what"
"2739940","2743020"," the expectations are, we haven't hit our collar yet, have we?"
"2743600","2746360"," We have not tagged this upside to the collar here."
"2746840","2751500"," And the expectation is that we were magnetting up here right where we're peeling off of it, but"
"2751500","2753640"," then also we magnet off it to some point as well."
"2754580","2757540"," And so I'm going to expect that we still go up there at this point. "
"2758200","2760200"," That we can still go up there at this point."
"2760420","2768400"," And furthermore, if we don't begin to regain this level here, this 4, 4, 8, 8, 7, we are actually"
"2768400","2773180"," going to magnet to the downside and fill these long puts down here for JPM."
"2773800","2776260"," And I'll tell you what, I want you guys to know something out there. "
"2776420","2780280"," JPM does not care about next quarter."
"2780440","2785320"," They don't care about spring times, June, July, they care about the quarter."
"2786080","2796680"," And they would like nothing less than for us to trade, to trade this 4, 2, 1, 0."
"2796680","2800960"," I believe that's 4, 2, 1, 0 into end of quarter. "
"2801280","2806780"," JPM loves like this nice up move, come down, nice up move, come down, they love this action."
"2807820","2815940"," And what it does is they can then sell their products to their investors and say, hey look, for 12"
"2815940","2822980"," months we had 10 great months, we had two bad months, and we hedged appropriately, and we got paid"
"2822980","2824300"," on those two months as well."
"2824300","2830020"," Combat likes stay with us, we give you consistent returns, we get to manage your money, collect all"
"2830020","2835400"," of those fees, and the market will move forward and down the road over time. "
"2835520","2839120"," Every once in a while we'll have a couple of something unknown to the marketplace, but there's"
"2839120","2840480"," nothing we can do about that right?"
"2840760","2845000"," We got some kind of terrorist attack or we get some kind of, I don't fucking know something bad"
"2845000","2851180"," happens or we blow some shit up or we raped and pillaged the banks and the market crashed."
"2851880","2857800"," We hedged that too by the way, and oh by the way we also have insurance on real market crashes,"
"2857800","2858520"," they actually do."
"2859060","2860560"," That was implemented after 1987. "
"2861480","2863420"," So they're protected no matter what, right?"
"2863780","2869960"," Thanks are protected no matter what, and they want nothing more than to see us come down here and"
"2869960","2872380"," buy another bottom down here right?"
"2872780","2879600"," Just for the end of year, for the fourth, excuse me for Q4 into December and try to bring it"
"2879600","2881960"," back up and bring it back down and bring it back up again."
"2882120","2883740"," So that's how it goes."
"2884060","2887900"," So when you hear people say, and that's the other part about gamma too, we're not going to get a"
"2887900","2894040"," gamma today, but gamma is negative right now and it's not a good thing to see negative gamma. "
"2894100","2901320"," We'll start to sell the rips but yeah, so just so you guys know that has more to do with"
"2901320","2906040"," dealers, but gamma can be overrun any day of the week, you'll understand this way."
"2906240","2910600"," I love gamma, but if you get real money buying, real money selling, your gamma goes right out the"
"2910600","2912860"," fucking door, because the banks have stepped in."
"2913420","2919000"," The dealers, the dealers in the positioning of the market matter, only when the banks are not"
"2919000","2919980"," buying or selling. "
"2920380","2925980"," If you're a gamma trader out there, tell me you know this because I see gamma traders that don't"
"2925980","2932780"," know this, not all but a good proportion of them are sometimes going to say, well gamma told me"
"2932780","2936660"," this was going to happen, it didn't happen, and I'm like that's because the fucking banks came out,"
"2937000","2942020"," and they were buying and selling, they run over all of that like it means nothing, and you wind up"
"2942020","2947360"," chasing right, you wind up chasing that real money buying and selling by major banks."
"2958710","2963170"," Gotta be careful what I say here, I'm concerned that financials might be over the skis a little bit"
"2963170","2967890"," in the next year, lots of buybacks going around the bank system, yeah, you know, someone from"
"2967890","2973750"," myself, right, just to be clear with you guys, I'm still on, I want to see this rejection this"
"2973750","2973990"," week."
"2975110","2981810"," I don't see a major pullback until September, October, though time is ticking, right?"
"2983010","2986750"," Quarter, we're at August 12th, right?"
"2987390","2992170"," So today's August 12th, we're going into the 13th, and bulls don't have a lot of time into that"
"2992170","2992750"," time period. "
"2993430","2999890"," As this clock ticks, right, as time passes, that window of opportunity for bulls to take this take"
"2999890","3006110"," this market higher starts to wane, and you'll you'll begin to actually see that sideways and down"
"3006110","3011750"," market into that seasonal weakness of September and October, that's what we'll end up seeing."
"3012570","3017110"," So right now, I don't, right now I mean for bulls, it's do or die here, you don't have a"
"3017110","3020950"," lot of time on the boards to be pushing higher, you got like a week, that's it."
"3020950","3022990"," That's basically all you got to be moving higher. "
"3029510","3033350"," Yeah, I love Gex, I love Gex, I love Gama, I'm a Gama and Gex trader."
"3033850","3038450"," It gives me good market awareness where we are, but the moment that real money buying and selling"
"3038450","3043210"," starts, that shit goes right out the fucking window, so let me can amplify that, let's say we're at"
"3043210","3048050"," negative Gama, if they were selling, yeah, it amplifies, it buys the move down, but if they start"
"3048050","3050810"," buying a negative Gama, that shit's out the window, right?"
"3050950","3052150"," We get the reversal, we're heading higher."
"3054960","3059800"," So anyways, the point here is this, bulls don't have a lot left here. "
"3059920","3061420"," They don't have a ton on their side."
"3062100","3066680"," It's do or die for them into the end of Q3."
"3066920","3072380"," So we've got about a month and a half left here, and you know, it's not a coincidence that we're"
"3072380","3074180"," at August 12th. "
"3074220","3079080"," We got two or three days and so we're at that midway point, we're at a big inflection point for"
"3079080","3079720"," bulls."
"3080520","3082220"," XLF is saying one story."
"3083680","3084440"," XLK, right?"
"3084580","3085840"," This is the technology sector. "
"3086860","3088940"," This is a little bit different story here, right?"
"3089120","3090420"," This is flashing bearish."
"3091260","3095700"," You can see this is a daily chart in XLK, where XLF is saying, hey, everything is fine."
"3096480","3098660"," XLK is saying, nope, everything is not fine. "
"3099160","3104540"," We want that confirmation here, you've got that indecision green spring top right there."
"3105740","3108120"," This is an indecision candle here, if it's going up or down."
"3108800","3114220"," If on Monday we get that rejection XLK, you're going to feel it in S&P 500. "
"3116140","3118080"," XLC, let's take a look at that really quick."
"3118400","3120280"," We're going to wear a bounce around in some sectors really quick."
"3120940","3122440"," This is the communications sector. "
"3122720","3124240"," This one's looking healthy, believe it or not."
"3124460","3125700"," XLC, XLK, repairs."
"3126920","3129460"," So right now XLC is saying everything is okay. "
"3130000","3136440"," We're going to look back over here on the triggers and take a look at XLK and see what this"
"3136440","3137780"," looks like on triggers, right?"
"3137960","3138840"," What is this confirming?"
"3139660","3141320"," More downside to come, right?"
"3142520","3146180"," XLK, Nasdaq, not looking healthy right now."
"3146340","3149800"," Nasdaq, even if Nasdaq squeezes on Monday, right?"
"3150520","3154440"," Still, that consolidation, the bulls need this right here."
"3154940","3159040"," They need the squeeze on Monday, the consolidation and a reversal to the upside. "
"3160660","3161120"," You see that?"
"3161400","3163820"," Bulls need this into end of quarter right here."
"3163820","3165040"," They need this ramp."
"3165600","3169000"," If at any point they get a rejection, I'm going to give you some hard numbers here. "
"3169080","3170260"," I want you to pay attention to this."
"3170860","3178400"," If you see, 170 get rejected on XLK next week, and it starts heading lower, it's going to confirm"
"3178400","3180080"," that the entire market is heading down."
"3180380","3183580"," You end up seeing a trade from 170 down to 200. "
"3184400","3185740"," One, excuse me, not 200."
"3186000","3189320"," One 59, 160, let's call it by the time we get there."
"3190000","3191960"," So 170 to 160 and XLK. "
"3193080","3198980"," We're also going to take a look at Vix, or Vix really quick, and we're going to look at Dixie"
"3198980","3199580"," really quick."
"3200620","3203980"," So Dixie is kind of lying right now."
"3204480","3205860"," This is a daily chart on Dixie. "
"3205860","3209540"," If you look at Dixie, we know where known sellers are."
"3209900","3212000"," We know they were right here, right?"
"3212740","3216680"," These are where known sellers are, and they're being tested and probed right now."
"3216800","3217780"," This is not a good sign. "
"3217780","3226460"," This is showing a further upside move to Dixie."
"3226820","3229340"," I'm not having a different chart, hold on here."
"3237380","3241960"," Anything over 105 is bear town. "
"3242740","3244840"," This is bloodbath town up here."
"3246100","3252460"," So if you begin to see Dixie move its way up here and trade this 105, that would be the"
"3252460","3256260"," corrective move for SPX down to 428, 432."
"3257200","3258300"," You would see that move higher. "
"3258560","3260080"," Anything above 105, right?"
"3260620","3263440"," You can kiss 428 and 432."
"3264300","3264620"," Goodbye."
"3265360","3268880"," Now, this chart on a daily is somewhat lying. "
"3270120","3272480"," On a 4-hour chart, it looks kind of bullish here, right?"
"3272680","3275520"," It's trying to smash above, smash above, one, two, and three."
"3276240","3280900"," Not looking too healthy for the bulls, but there's a slight roll here on the hourly chart to the"
"3280900","3281180"," downside."
"3281780","3289120"," So just on Friday's close, this is kind of mirroring that idea that we get the blast up on Monday"
"3289120","3289480"," open. "
"3290040","3294720"," But watch your asses for that upside move for Monday."
"3294920","3297500"," So Dixie, on Monday, pay attention to it."
"3297500","3302560"," You don't want to see Dixie get rebotted at 102.66. Pay attention to this on Monday. "
"3302720","3306240"," This pullback here would signal a move up on the S&P 500."
"3306240","3310740"," But if this does hold here, we start ripping off this to the upside."
"3311380","3315720"," You would see that failure on 472, I believe, on SPOs. "
"3315880","3317340"," Let me make sure I get that number right on SPOs."
"3318420","3319480"," Let's see, 447."
"3320560","3324300"," You would see the rejection on 447 on SPOs on Monday. "
"3325260","3328400"," You'd see the dip by on Dixie on Monday."
"3329700","3332220"," Now, VIX has the same problem right here."
"3333240","3342180"," VIX on Friday's close is showing the upside move for a one-hour chart, is showing an upside or"
"3342180","3345880"," downside move for VIX for Monday as well. "
"3346580","3353600"," But if that gets bought to the downside there, looking ahead on a four-hour chart, which is a daily"
"3353600","3361340"," chart, if this begins to roll down, close all these gaps down here and bounces back up and starts"
"3361340","3362300"," to come higher, right?"
"3362400","3367840"," You start to see that bloodbath on Monday, and then we start to curve up here and try to take"
"3367840","3371640"," out any of this stuff up here, this 30 bucks or whatever."
"3371840","3377220"," You're going to see some major, major downside moves."
"3377420","3378500"," This is March, by the way. "
"3379120","3382640"," You actually have the next one right here is where you tag."
"3383180","3384220"," You need to get a break."
"3384500","3386420"," Then it will be like this in October, November. "
"3386420","3388980"," So, this will be October into November."
"3389880","3393060"," That much larger move up and higher onto the VIX."
"3393420","3400260"," So, it is imperative for you coming into early next week to see the price action on the S&P"
"3400260","3406760"," 500, based on Dixie VIX, XLK, XLC, and XLF. "
"3407100","3411620"," HYG, look and bearish here, our bullish here, excuse me, right?"
"3411620","3414720"," So, we've got HYG looking bullish."
"3415760","3419220"," So, this is counter to what people are saying."
"3419360","3421280"," XLF is counter to what people are saying. "
"3422080","3424200"," The indecision that we're in, S&P 500."
"3425480","3427540"," HYG is saying, nope, the move is to the upside."
"3427900","3432780"," We're going to clear out all this stuff back here at 76.40. We're going to continue up and clear"
"3432780","3436700"," out everything at 79.64. Nothing bearish in the daily there. "
"3436700","3442660"," When the four-hour chart indecision is still right, this is an indecision, coiling."
"3442980","3443560"," We're going to make a move."
"3443700","3444320"," We're going to make a move. "
"3444460","3445080"," We're going to make a move."
"3445480","3450520"," Still no move in HYG, just so you know XLF is up, right?"
"3451340","3453240"," XLF is still up right now, right?"
"3453660","3455460"," So, it's not showing risk-off behavior yet."
"3456020","3460320"," HYG, not showing risk-off behavior either yet. "
"3460720","3464100"," Still showing indecision if it becomes risk-off."
"3464100","3468860"," And I want you to know that this week, because we went to the 15th, we're going to find out."
"3468980","3470020"," We're going to find out. "
"3470660","3479160"," You'll start to see some violent moves, and if this become more of a leading indicator, if it's up"
"3479160","3479520"," or down."
"3479680","3480640"," Right now, it's showing up."
"3481040","3483180"," HYG is a great leading indicator in the market. "
"3483960","3491320"," So far, HYG, XLF, both showing not a risk-off environment so far for the S&P 500."
"3499990","3501630"," Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly."
"3507320","3508200"," So, exactly. "
"3509000","3512240"," So, XLF, HYG is claiming we're going up, right?"
"3512580","3513200"," Well, not up."
"3513420","3515900"," Well, I guess HYG and Friday, what are they saying?"
"3516560","3518020"," They're saying up, right?"
"3518440","3526760"," So, here's Friday's XYG and Friday, even though price was down in that close, these four-hour bars"
"3526760","3528220"," here are saying up, right?"
"3528620","3532160"," Up to the upside, not to be concerned as of yet."
"3532160","3537360"," Even if price is not showing on the S&P 500, we're also going to take a look here on"
"3537360","3547080"," NQ, E-mini, bearish, bearish,"
"3547120","3547640"," bearish, right?"
"3548340","3549160"," Couldn't get up over here. "
"3549940","3555600"," Rejected up over here on the 10th, and I think it was John H saying he wants to see the"
"3555600","3558060"," squeeze on Monday on NQ."
"3559360","3563320"," In the overnight on Sunday, you want to pay attention to 15160."
"3563320","3573040"," 0.75. If you're trying to take along on Sunday futures, you want to be exiting right right around"
"3573040","3577910"," 15, 15160. "
"3579190","3584830"," Next trade for you, if you're a bull, is up here to 15320."
"3586390","3592030"," And if we bounce around in here, I'm going to tell the bulls that all hope is not lost yet"
"3592030","3592510"," for them."
"3600400","3602180"," That's what I say on Dixie. "
"3602420","3602800"," They're going to roll."
"3603160","3608900"," I see that Dixie on a daily looks bullish as fuck, but on like a 15-minute, one-hour, on"
"3608900","3613300"," a one-minute chart, except for the four-hour, it looks bearish."
"3614180","3616640"," And Vix looks bearish, too, so it's the downside in Vix. "
"3617600","3620960"," So Sunday futures, I'm hoping for that nice clean pop."
"3622140","3626320"," So tech right now, what is it showing us for the S&P 500?"
"3627020","3629580"," It is showing us some kind of a consolidation phase."
"3630780","3634900"," If they can hold itself up, you'll see a consolidation, maybe a squeeze higher on Monday. "
"3635800","3642300"," Then look, if you're a bull, you want to see if NASDAQ can continue to consolidate to the upside."
"3643380","3644940"," Now, I'm going to do something here in the background."
"3645140","3645980"," You guys ask some questions. "
"3646200","3648000"," I got to do something really quick here in the background."
"3648000","3650820"," I want to show you guys a couple more things."
"3652540","3654880"," Really quick before you wrap this up. "
"3655600","3656680"," Let me just one second here."
"3660580","3670060"," Let me just one second here."
"3678630","3679670"," Let me bring this up here. "
"3681710","3684110"," This is SPX on a daily chart."
"3684750","3686230"," I want to show you one last thing here."
"3687070","3688310"," Four zigzag channels. "
"3688710","3690170"," I'm going to show you four quick things here."
"3691530","3694690"," And I want you to see four quick things, SPX."
"3696430","3703770"," You've got an extreme downside move here for SPX of 430, 435, 432. "
"3704730","3708850"," If you can't see this at home, there's a blue line right here."
"3709490","3716050"," If you get this squeeze up and then the rejection down, you're still on uptrend, even if this 432"
"3716050","3716850"," gets bought."
"3718230","3719850"," Maybe you have a rejection over here. "
"3720090","3722730"," This is October, some time in October."
"3722730","3728190"," If this dip gets bought down here at 432, so I do want you to see that if you are"
"3728190","3730430"," a bull out there, we are still in the uptrend."
"3730870","3735830"," We are at the midway point of the uptrend downside move for bulls. "
"3736790","3742610"," Some bulls out there want to buy that 432, 430, somewhere in there, 428 to the downside."
"3743710","3749050"," And you are seeing a little bit of a curve up on market breadth."
"3749050","3752030"," So I want you to take your attention right here. "
"3752510","3756890"," And even though price is not falling, I want you to pay attention to market breadth starting to"
"3756890","3757570"," curl up."
"3758050","3759490"," I want you to pay attention to that."
"3760550","3769550"," I also want you to pay attention to a slight, what looks like a slight attempt to pull back up"
"3769550","3771430"," here on PMO. "
"3771910","3778290"," And we also have the zero line coming into play right now on PPO."
"3778290","3781310"," So we are going to see if there is a reaction trade down here."
"3781430","3782210"," Watch this right here. "
"3782850","3785530"," If we can regain and cross down below."
"3786170","3787210"," If this is peeking out."
"3787810","3792150"," If PPO is peeking out and then if we get some kind of a same kind of reaction trade here. "
"3792730","3795890"," You are actually already starting to see it in market breadth to the upside right here."
"3796470","3798030"," So this is kind of like the do or die, right?"
"3798550","3805330"," PPO, PMO, market breadth and zigzag channels are all saying this is kind of get right here."
"3805330","3807650"," In flexion moment is here for bulls. "
"3808310","3815150"," And you'll probably see that confirmation by Wednesday of this week."
"3815750","3817130"," If we have further downside."
"3821920","3823860"," Then go to a label chart. "
"3826420","3827980"," Just come back here to SPY."
"3828440","3831480"," And by the way, if you don't know this already."
"3832260","3838360"," I am on calls for the 20 or 19th or 21st of September. "
"3838360","3843900"," And then I've got a whole mess of calls I believe for next Friday as well."
"3844160","3849260"," So if you want to know what my take is on next week."
"3849800","3852160"," I'm on that bounce trade for next week myself. "
"3853880","3856440"," We're going to look at one quick second here."
"3863680","3865440"," One quick second here."
"3886520","3888360"," 44750 right up in here. "
"3895660","3898500"," So you have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday."
"3899820","3903200"," We're going to call this in flexion week for the S&P 500."
"3906030","3907410"," Do or die for the bulls. "
"3908630","3911010"," You guys can snip this and take this home."
"3911970","3919980"," Edit this do or die for the bulls."
"3927350","3927990"," 4601. "
"3949120","3952720"," If you are a bear out there for next week."
"3954340","3958600"," You're just looking for a confirmation to the downside at this point."
"3959520","3960560"," Targeting 432. "
"3962160","3965420"," You'll likely get 440 by Friday by Friday."
"3965800","3969900"," 440 97 would be the price target for next Friday."
"3970800","3972360"," Friday PT down here. "
"3972480","3973440"," 440 39."
"3986390","3987790"," You have another target down here."
"3988030","3988470"," 438. "
"3989510","3990150"," 437."
"3990750","3993130"," I guess I'll put the nastiest down here."
"3998720","4011690"," So here's your"
"4011690","4012910"," price target for next week. "
"4012910","4015690"," 440 39 and 437 49."
"4016130","4023540"," If at any point this week you see any kind of rejection or confirmation of the downside here."
"4024220","4026340"," I'm going to be targeting this into Friday. "
"4027140","4029560"," This is an inflection week for spy."
"4030380","4036600"," So on the open on spy on Monday, I'm going to look for 44750 on the open."
"4037140","4041940"," At least 44750 by the open if not the closed of day on Monday. "
"4042300","4043760"," And then a fight here."
"4044040","4047400"," Major fight taking place for bulls and bears."
"4048040","4050680"," I'm on calls for next week for 459. "
"4051200","4055660"," So if you want to know what I think happens next week, I think it's massive upside we're headed."
"4056220","4058540"," I think we're going right back to that scene of the crime next week."
"4058740","4061860"," But you know, I got to put my money where my mouth is when I think it's going to happen. "
"4061860","4069430"," So yeah, I haven't said anything on Tesla."
"4069470","4071610"," I'm still looking for that downside move on Tesla."
"4072330","4073730"," I'm still not happy with Tesla. "
"4073730","4075130"," We can look at that though right now if you want."
"4076350","4077930"," Yeah, TLT I can look at as well."
"4080440","4081340"," Give me one second there. "
"4081360","4082360"," I got to call it coming in."
"4084100","4085160"," Let me tell you one second here."
"4086220","4087960"," So expectations for next week, okay. "
"4088600","4089900"," This is do or die for bulls."
"4091040","4092220"," I don't care what the market says."
"4092340","4093580"," I don't care what the sectors say. "
"4094520","4101779"," I do to an extent XLF, Dixie, some other things out there that are saying maybe there's a little"
"4101779","4105700"," bit more downside to tech or consolidation in tech."
"4106720","4112640"," If we get the consolidation in tech and S&P 500 can continue up and to the right."
"4113640","4118899"," If tech starts to reject and slam and starts trading below, it's going to get nasty. "
"4119760","4123960"," So we're going to pay attention closely to tech next week to see if they can recover, consolidate"
"4123960","4126260"," for that leg higher and end of quarter."
"4127060","4130100"," We're going to also paying attention to what the bulls do here."
"4130760","4132640"," Bulls have no choice here. "
"4132760","4133340"," It's like no choice."
"4133899","4138220"," You get that rejection on that daily trigger and it is going to be on like Donkey Kong."
"4138439","4141700"," I assure you they tee off on this here on Monday. "
"4142180","4143160"," Look the fuck out."
"4143260","4143640"," You'll be seeing."
"4144060","4144279"," I'm assuming. "
"4144560","4148680"," I don't know about you guys, but I'll probably put a major hedge on the market if there's any kind"
"4148680","4149500"," of rejection up here."
"4149580","4151140"," So this is what you're looking for."
"4152140","4154920"," Just like on the flip side of this, the bull's same kind of an idea. "
"4155479","4157060"," That thing rejects rejects."
"4157380","4158200"," It's going to get nasty."
"4164580","4165880"," So let me go back to. "
"4166180","4167279"," I want to go back to."
"4170279","4172740"," I'm going to take a look at Tesla for you, Apple and NVIDIA."
"4172939","4174220"," I'll do some thing man stuff you want. "
"4174660","4175620"," So just right up in here."
"4175840","4177100"," If you want to snip this right here."
"4178899","4180680"," You know, all this is saying up, right?"
"4181420","4185660"," Higher low and early, higher low and early, higher low and early, higher low, right?"
"4185880","4187100"," We're at the zero line here. "
"4187120","4190279"," Maybe another bump, another bump down or two, something like that."
"4191020","4196160"," I'm not opposed to like one more down day or so, but you really are looking for this right here."
"4196300","4198960"," Like this is going to be your oh shit moments. "
"4199620","4201080"," If you're, if you're a bull."
"4202240","4204000"," And get out of the way here."
"4204320","4207000"," If we go up here, I'll be with you on the street for this stream. "
"4207000","4207820"," I'll be here with you."
"4208080","4209780"," There's no way I'm going to let you trade that alone."
"4213240","4217560"," Cause I saw on Thursday and Friday, some of you were like, I bought this and I bought that. "
"4217800","4218440"," Why is it going down?"
"4218440","4220720"," And I'm like, you got to see it like reverse to the upside."
"4221300","4223500"," It's like Monday and Tuesday, I'll be here with you."
"4223620","4225740"," There's no way you're going to trade this alone without me here. "
"4226560","4229600"," And you're going to let the algorithms take over if we begin to trade above it."
"4230200","4231620"," We'll take that trade too."
"4232060","4235180"," If it reverses down for the test down on the daily again. "
"4235860","4238920"," We'll look to see if it holds and the early comes up here."
"4239000","4242300"," We can take that one more time and make some major new highs."
"4246340","4248160"," We're going to get Apple and Tesla. "
"4250930","4254250"," Well, that's not some reason I'm tapping away here."
"4255550","4256710"," We have Tesla first."
"4258750","4259190"," Tesla. "
"4259850","4260770"," Let's talk Tesla."
"4261050","4262550"," You guys hear me all the time talking about Tesla."
"4263290","4266010"," There's a few of you out there that I actually do. "
"4266610","4266930"," I text."
"4267830","4270030"," There's a few bulls out there that I go."
"4270290","4272490"," I'll send them a text and I'll say to them. "
"4273090","4274330"," It's time to buy Tesla."
"4276350","4279370"," And sometimes they listen to me and sometimes they don't."
"4279670","4282550"," But they always know that when I text them, they're like, Oh, shit. "
"4282950","4283890"," Send the by Tesla."
"4284190","4285810"," I've been long for a while now."
"4285970","4286390"," So Tesla. "
"4287290","4288070"," Stock Tesla."
"4288930","4290990"," It's almost at a buy point."
"4291890","4295030"," That minus 20, minus 20, minus 20 right now. "
"4295910","4296810"," That's a little bit more to go."
"4297850","4299530"," A little bit more to go."
"4299530","4301930"," So, tiny bit more to go. "
"4302430","4306290"," Whenever Tesla does this bottoming out and it's daily."
"4307290","4311810"," They got the lower, higher, lower right there, higher, low right here."
"4312570","4314890"," They're almost there on Tesla. "
"4315350","4315650"," Almost."
"4317030","4323090"," So, let's talk about Tesla with what I just told you about NDX, right?"
"4323730","4325030"," I just showed you XLK."
"4325830","4329230"," I showed you XLC XLK, but XLK more specifically. "
"4331440","4331920"," If."
"4333380","4334860"," Here's my alarm if we do this."
"4335100","4335380"," If. "
"4335760","4337280"," Watch that weekly is coming up."
"4337700","4340120"," I want you to know that this is bullish right here."
"4341060","4344860"," That crossing of the weekly over monthly is bullish. "
"4347000","4347920"," Still coming up."
"4349600","4350080"," Right."
"4351300","4351780"," If. "
"4352480","4354840"," I showed you this a couple of weeks ago, right?"
"4358060","4362420"," Showed you that green box and said, Oh, it's going to get down to that two twenty four two thirty"
"4362420","4363580"," two somewhere in there."
"4364000","4364860"," Almost there, right?"
"4365100","4367140"," Tagged two thirty seven."
"4369470","4371370"," So, let's just say you have. "
"4371990","4373590"," Nice green day on Monday."
"4374290","4377490"," Slam back down on the early trigger in the S&P 500."
"4378610","4379250"," Right. "
"4380090","4381370"," Start to consolidate."
"4382750","4384110"," Then you get that push higher."
"4385170","4386470"," Something like this happens. "
"4387810","4387930"," Right."
"4388930","4390670"," Early trigger comes up underneath."
"4392530","4393010"," Right. "
"4393010","4396770"," Somewhere in there, you're going to be looking for a dip by down here on Tesla."
"4397410","4400930"," As I said before, two thirty two."
"4401430","4405110"," You have that nice one week moment down here next week at some points. "
"4405430","4407470"," You get down to that four thirty two, that sweet spot."
"4408030","4409310"," Slam that buy button."
"4409590","4410270"," You're a Tesla bull. "
"4410770","4413270"," You're like, cap or not done going up, cap or with you."
"4413410","4414410"," We're going all time highs."
"4414990","4416510"," We're going to fail all time highs cap. "
"4418850","4420490"," We'll go back to that right now, by the way."
"4421910","4423730"," Then this is your time, right?"
"4423950","4424190"," To shine."
"4424850","4425770"," I don't think it's Monday. "
"4426390","4432430"," I think it's like Tuesday or Wednesday is likely when Tesla has their real true dip buy."
"4433790","4436390"," So, just somewhere in here, if you're a Tesla bull."
"4436710","4437890"," I want to show you guys this. "
"4437970","4439690"," I'm going to go back to something really quick."
"4440810","4441910"," Hold on a second here."
"4443310","4445310"," I want to go back to SPX. "
"4447370","4449130"," Why is cap still bullish here?"
"4450230","4451130"," Let me show you why."
"4451990","4453350"," So, I want to show you this."
"4455700","4460200"," So, you figure we got, these are computers working too, right?"
"4461240","4461940"," Here's SPX. "
"4462940","4465840"," So, that green box is right above that JPM caller, right?"
"4466140","4468120"," You figure we got Q3 and Q4, right?"
"4468420","4469100"," Q3, Q4."
"4472270","4474010"," So, all's not lost here, right?"
"4474410","4476090"," Just look at this quarter right here."
"4476610","4477790"," This quarter is the same. "
"4479070","4479730"," Now, let's change."
"4482780","4483180"," Nothing."
"4483880","4485400"," Nothing has really changed. "
"4486300","4487440"," We're at an inflection point now."
"4487540","4487820"," That's it."
"4488100","4488680"," It's all exchanged. "
"4490040","4490980"," We're at an inflection point."
"4491120","4497720"," As a matter of fact, if you were to look at, um, if you were to look at the first"
"4497720","4505600"," week of May, and you go back to like, go to like, do a new search from like, beginning of"
"4505600","4507160"," May to May 15th."
"4507840","4510760"," And I bet you the new search was, market crash. "
"4511780","4512260"," Guaranteed."
"4513320","4514160"," Market crash."
"4514560","4515420"," Guaranteed that was the news. "
"4516040","4520540"," Now, if you're not directing your attention, this is because that JPM caller lines up with a"
"4520540","4525720"," failure of that high, right there."
"4526540","4528480"," Wouldn't it just be nice and clean and cute?"
"4529620","4533220"," Up there and into the thing, you get the failure on just before the previous high, right?"
"4533900","4539660"," You get your major correction in October, November, September, October, let's say, and you go, aha."
"4540960","4543880"," You know, bulls aren't getting their all time highs here. "
"4544080","4546640"," And then you get that nice drive up into December."
"4547660","4549300"," And there goes your all time highs."
"4550680","4554020"," There goes your, you know, 4700, 4800. "
"4554360","4554940"," Everybody's high."
"4555120","4555320"," Fine."
"4555600","4556680"," It's, uh, Hanukkah. "
"4556820","4557280"," It's December."
"4557920","4559640"," Everybody's doing the fist pumps."
"4560140","4565040"," You got all the bulls coming out saying, we're going to retest and go all the way up to 5 "
"4565040","4565720",",000 now. "
"4566060","4567520"," And that's actually where the failure is."
"4567580","4575060"," We come back down in January, February and, uh, the test was ripping face off into the end of the"
"4575060","4575280"," year."
"4575680","4577020"," And you just see it here. "
"4577160","4582580"," And then, you know, February, we actually actually get a real role in February and come way down"
"4582580","4586300"," and trade that 4,000 somewhere down there."
"4587100","4588760"," 4,200, 4,000."
"4588980","4590780"," Bears will tell you 3800. "
"4591180","4592200"," They want it right now."
"4592200","4594440"," Bears like, I want 3800 in this role right here."
"4595200","4596760"," Uh, but I don't think we're done here. "
"4596940","4600880"," So, uh, I think we're done like here."
"4601260","4604440"," Like December, December 31st, right there."
"4606400","4611240"," And then you get your just your January role death death spiral role. "
"4611580","4615720"," So, uh, Tesla saying that to an extent, right?"
"4616000","4620940"," Tesla has the ability here, uh, to get bought sometime this week."
"4620940","4623800"," I think this gets bought on Monday, but I think it comes back down one more time."
"4624160","4629200"," You're going to get that, that NASDAQ consolidation and then finally the move higher, uh, for end"
"4629200","4629540"," of quarter. "
"4629780","4631940"," I know it's probably says, uh, September here."
"4632060","4634560"," Let's call that September 30th right there."
"4634560","4635840"," And you get that big push up. "
"4636140","4638960"," You're going to get bears saying window dressing and all the other nonsense."
"4640080","4645660"," Uh, you'll get, uh, you'll get Tesla actually, uh, trading like 400 or something."
"4647200","4647600"," Okay. "
"4651900","4652360"," Hold on a second here."
"4652480","4652740"," Where's Rob?"
"4655340","4656460"," It's a Rob SF."
"4656680","4657880"," I'm going to make you a managing moderator. "
"4658860","4661660"," It's the highest thing you can be on YouTube."
"4662520","4667120"," Uh, though I have to make you an editor at some point, you and the rest of the guys, which"
"4667120","4668900"," is completely different than a managing moderator."
"4669280","4670720"," Don't hit any fucking buttons though. "
"4672580","4677560"," Don't hit any buttons unless you want to like, add in like caps not ugly or caps not fat."
"4677840","4684160"," You can like ban words like caps fat, caps got skinny arms, caps got small feet, whatever it is."
"4684160","4691540"," You're going to, you can ban all that stuff you want, but know that is a Santa rally. "
"4692120","4695200"," So the idea here is, here's just, you guys want to see it."
"4695880","4697100"," I'll show it to you right here."
"4697960","4700160"," Um, you can show it to you right here. "
"4700160","4702820"," So, uh, this is end of quarter."
"4702960","4703980"," This line right here."
"4704200","4705800"," My clicking on that, that's end of quarter. "
"4706480","4708720"," And then you've got, uh, end of year right here."
"4712000","4713380"," There's, uh, the 31st, right?"
"4714500","4719940"," The idea here would be that you would get, uh, some kind of a if you want to know the"
"4719940","4720640"," path that we're thinking."
"4721520","4724120"," Uh, the path is, um, somewhere in here. "
"4724300","4728560"," I don't know if it's right here or right here, but some kind of a attempt at all time highs."
"4729720","4733180"," Um, failure of all time, excuse me, I should say failure of all time highs."
"4733760","4741220"," Uh, trade down, uh, into, sorry, wait a minute, get this wrong. "
"4741640","4742300"," It's all wrong."
"4742500","4742700"," It's all right."
"4743320","4745980"," It's on the wrong time skill here. "
"4747320","4748040"," That's 2024."
"4748920","4750260"," That's actually 5,000."
"4750880","4751700"," Uh, right. "
"4752300","4754360"," Let's get this, uh, charts looking like shit."
"4755420","4756600"," Why does the scale right?"
"4758020","4759620"," So, this is December right here."
"4760300","4765960"," So, you would see the attempt at, uh, let me before I even do that show you where all time"
"4765960","4766400"," highs is. "
"4772040","4773160"," This is all time highs."
"4780560","4781300"," So, you would see the attempt."
"4781760","4787860"," If bulls win, you're going to see an attempt for the failure of the, of the one previous role here. "
"4788400","4790940"," Um, for this quarter, uh, pull back here."
"4791300","4792560"," Probably a pretty major one."
"4793100","4796520"," Let's call this 10.30. Right about there. "
"4797360","4798320"," And then into December."
"4799180","4800820"," Uh, this would be the expectation right here."
"4803140","4803860"," Something like that. "
"4805340","4806860"," Uh, so there it is right there."
"4807580","4808900"," Uh, this would be actually be higher."
"4809180","4812700"," You might see, bring this up a little bit. "
"4813040","4814560"," Yeah, somewhere right down in there."
"4815540","4818420"," Uh, so you would see a leveling off of this average right here."
"4820350","4822130"," You would see this average get picked up. "
"4822390","4823950"," Push this up on a 27 EMA."
"4825130","4826370"," Roll this bad boy over."
"4826690","4828550"," Slam down into, uh, 430. "
"4829770","4834210"," Then you would see the attempt for all time highs, uh, into the end of quarter of Q3."
"4835090","4837090"," You'd wake up into January and February."
"4837670","4839350"," And we would start bloodbath and it down. "
"4839550","4840770"," You're actually going to hit this target here."
"4841810","4843690"," Uh, that would be 4,500, 4,600."
"4844290","4845870"," Uh, you'd actually start to begin to see us. "
"4846230","4847430"," This would be gone at that point."
"4848810","4849670"," No, hold on."
"4851710","4852470"," That wouldn't be there. "
"4858580","4859880"," We'd actually see the break here."
"4861260","4863520"," And we would actually start heading much, much lower."
"4863680","4867160"," You'd actually head down to the weekly, um, which would probably be right about here. "
"4867780","4870280"," Uh, and then the monthly, which would be way down here."
"4870340","4871960"," You want those price targets now, I can give them to you."
"4872040","4875000"," So, um, so we're going to turn. "
"4875100","4876100"," In my view, we're going to trade."
"4878040","4879560"," 48, 44, somewhere in there."
"4880400","4881880"," 48, 44, 48, 50. "
"4882100","4882400"," Let's call it."
"4882400","4884800"," And then you would end up trading."
"4891230","4895910"," You would end up trading, um, 48, 44, the upside target. "
"4896010","4900050"," Then you would end up trading, uh, in a breaking below that 4,500."
"4900270","4901810"," This is for, uh, New Year."
"4902250","4905770"," Uh, you'd end up trading, uh, 4,300. "
"4907050","4908050"," Break below that."
"4908370","4915720"," And your next target would be, uh, uh, I think for 20."
"4915720","4919200"," And then your February low. "
"4920180","4921620"," It's not on this chart."
"4921740","4922440"," I have to give it to you."
"4922820","4923620"," One second here. "
"4923620","4924360"," I'll do it somewhere else."
"4938660","4941420"," Your downside target in February, it would be."
"4945160","4945580"," 3550. "
"4947560","4947980"," 3550."
"4948160","4949000"," So, spoons."
"4949620","4951200"," Um, I'm just going to put this on this chart here. "
"4952280","4953960"," So, I'll leave this up for you guys."
"4954560","4956400"," Uh, go march."
"4956400","4962120"," March 01. "
"4963900","4964860"," Uh, 3500."
"4970290","4970870"," Right there."
"4974340","4975720"," Uh, pretty fucking violent, right?"
"4976680","4978300"," Pretty fucking violent fucking. "
"4978300","4979400"," This is going to be a nasty."
"4979780","4980720"," It's not going to be straight down."
"4981640","4984180"," But you're going to likely see blast down there. "
"4985140","4986140"," Blast down there."
"4987280","4988160"," Blast down there."
"4988740","4989960"," That would be the worst of it. "
"4992290","4994090"," That would be the worst it could be."
"4994250","4995230"," If you're looking for, like, the ugly."
"4995670","4996570"," Probably right there. "
"5000120","5001560"," That would be the worst it would get."
"5004880","5006860"," Uh, it'll be a retest down here of that 3500."
"5008180","5010800"," And this would just make the, this would be your trough check. "
"5011880","5017380"," And then you, you're actually going to continue hard of 5,000 for, for 2024 up here."
"5018720","5023980"," Uh, in nine months, I would expect to see, uh, 35 something."
"5024340","5025460"," And the worst case scenario. "
"5026380","5029560"," Um, I would not be shocked to see us hold off at 4,000."
"5033610","5042020"," Uh, catalyst for that move."
"5042300","5043020"," Uh, seasonal weakness. "
"5043380","5045420"," Good enough for me to wrap it up."
"5045580","5051720"," And the other, the other part about that move into next year is I think they sell spec growth into"
"5051720","5051940"," you."
"5052120","5056480"," I think that the catalyst for this is like accumulation and distribution too. "
"5057020","5060620"," Like the, the macro stuff plays into this."
"5060620","5062840"," There's some macro stuff that plays into this."
"5063280","5066820"," You're likely going to see something about China in the beginning of the year. "
"5066900","5070100"," You're likely going to see, um, structural issues with China."
"5070160","5076680"," You're likely going to see, uh, some kind of a front running of a pausing of rates in, uh, May,"
"5076680","5078060"," June, some, some time in there."
"5078300","5082380"," So a front running of a, of a, of a pause turning into, uh, cuts. "
"5083820","5084880"," Um, being front run."
"5086080","5090260"," You're also, this is a recheck of our previous low to make sure we're going higher."
"5090940","5093840"," There's also the, the accumulation distribution of profit. "
"5094100","5098940"," So you've got, uh, people that bought in October and they're going to look to take profit and"
"5098940","5102800"," they're going to look to tell bulls that there's higher to go, that they should stay long."
"5103680","5108060"," And what they'll do is they'll cut spec growth, uh, heavily into end of year."
"5108720","5111320"," Um, mean, you know, they're going to cut that. "
"5111420","5112020"," They're going to cut probably."
"5112200","5116860"," I think they're going to try and, if I had to guess here, if I was the fed, but they"
"5116860","5119260"," want to bring both economic cycles together."
"5119780","5122160"," So, uh, we have two cycles right now. "
"5122320","5126960"," We've got the COVID cycle and then we've got our normal, uh, economic cycle, business cycle,"
"5126960","5128540"," whatever you want to call it."
"5129220","5133300"," And I, my thought here is that there's going to be an attempt by the fed and the, and the"
"5133300","5141000"," banks to try to, if you've got a, um, if you've got a sign wave that goes like this and"
"5141000","5142140"," that's our economic cycle."
"5142440","5145360"," Right now we have another one that's like this. "
"5146200","5148580"," And at some point they're going to want to bring them together."
"5149460","5151980"," Uh, and try to get them to, to trade together."
"5152820","5155580"," Um, and this is the action of the fed. "
"5156060","5161600"," So, so Jerome Powell's talked about this recently in his last rate decision."
"5162240","5166540"," There were reporters that said, don't you think you need to do more?"
"5167380","5174080"," And Jerome Powell's point was we are doing enough to try to kill this COVID cycle."
"5174380","5181480"," Not quite kill it, but, but get it to, to, to, um, stabilize with the regular economy. "
"5182160","5184920"," It's not so much that they're trying to just like murder it or anything."
"5185500","5187580"," But you have our, our grander cycle here."
"5187800","5189400"," And we've got this smaller cycle. "
"5189880","5192000"," That's kind of fucking with the program, right?"
"5193140","5197640"," And they really want this cycle to kind of like come up and come down with the, with the greater"
"5197640","5198020"," market."
"5198280","5204420"," So, um, he addressed this specifically in his last, last rate meeting where he was like, look, we"
"5204420","5205900"," want the market to do its thing."
"5206020","5207620"," And this is kind of a greater thesis too. "
"5208500","5212480"," Um, I, I personally don't believe you're going to get a fed."
"5213460","5214440"," That's overly accommodative."
"5215420","5217600"," Or they're going to try to get away from being overly accommodative. "
"5218600","5221480"," And they're going to also try to get away from over tightening."
"5222080","5223240"," Um, overly restrictive."
"5224720","5227940"," Uh, they've made these statements consistently for the past year. "
"5228060","5230600"," If you listen closely and put all of the statements together."
"5230600","5234320"," Uh, and specifically this last rate decision."
"5235020","5238280"," He was, he was very clear to these reporters. "
"5238940","5242200"," And it was shocking because reporters were looking for that."
"5242560","5246680"," Yeah, you've tightened to, to kill this COVID stuff, but what about the rest of the market?"
"5247120","5252160"," And I think that the, that the Fed realizes and knows to a certain extent that."
"5252860","5258760"," Um, they've done so much, uh, over and under tightening and loosening. "
"5258760","5264320"," That volatility is on the rise, like the market volatility is starting to go like this."
"5266200","5273340"," And they have to be a little bit less, uh, you know, like easing and a little bit less restrictive."
"5274380","5277600"," Um, on these top and bottom ends of volatility. "
"5278240","5283020"," And try to let the market run on its own and only step in when needed."
"5283340","5285880"," And you saw that too with regional banks."
"5285880","5291060"," Um, and you're seeing it with removing liquidity from the, they're saying they're removing"
"5291060","5293220"," liquidity from the system, but they're actually not. "
"5293720","5300120"," They're providing it, uh, through Fed banks to, uh, prime banks to, uh, banks to buy the market."
"5300360","5302160"," So there actually is liquidity in the market."
"5302960","5305080"," Um, believe it or not. "
"5307220","5310960"," But I think there's like a, uh, transition in with the Fed."
"5311740","5313640"," Or how the Fed is going to treat the market."
"5313640","5319120"," Um, I think it's on a, excuse me, on a greater year on a greater scale. "
"5320000","5328220"," They're looking back on, uh, 2019 and 20, uh, and then, uh, the run that we had into 2021."
"5328700","5331720"," And then this rollover in 2022."
"5332280","5337680"," And you can actually see it in how the time they spent in cutting this market. "
"5337680","5344620"," They spent all of 2021 cutting, uh, individual sectors, then they spent 2022 trying to bring the"
"5344620","5346900"," indexes down and the big boys down."
"5347380","5350160"," And you know, you got two years of cuts going on here."
"5350420","5357320"," Uh, so it looks like, uh, they're the attempt here is to not only fight that COVID stuff, but"
"5357320","5361980"," stabilize the greater markets to trade sideways and up over time. "
"5362380","5365680"," It's very similar to what happened in the 50s, 60s and 70s."
"5366040","5367960"," Uh, I don't know that they're going to be successful. "
