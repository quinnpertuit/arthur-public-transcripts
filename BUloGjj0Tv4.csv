"55500","56540"," Good morning, everybody."
"56840","57720"," Let's get hearing me out there."
"59340","66520"," Good morning, wife's boyfriend, Marcus, Jasmine, Bill, Matt, Doug, Christina, Jafar, Fazon, Chris,"
"66720","67000"," good morning. "
"68460","69760"," Turn this down here."
"78880","86340"," Good morning, Chris, good morning, Steven, Dragon Wolf."
"91860","94280"," Chris, Dragon Wolf, yeah, I think you, baby, good to see you. "
"94280","97820"," And this is, we trust a little big bear, Mary Garrison, good to see you."
"99420","104820"," Ryan, Todd, Mario, and Quiz of again, I'll take that name, by the way."
"105760","106220"," Okay, brother. "
"106960","108040"," Blindness target to see you as well."
"108220","108420"," Good morning."
"109020","109680"," Good morning. "
"110380","111120"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"113880","116080"," I'm running a little late at that one daughter with me."
"117600","120120"," She's sticking around beside me here doing her morning work."
"122840","126400"," Yeah, PPI is definitely hot this morning without a doubt. "
"128620","130020"," Yeah, we're doing it this morning."
"130240","131840"," We've got a good 20, maybe 18 minutes or so."
"132020","135860"," Good morning, Mr. Brown, five hertz, good morning, Dan, good to see you brother Mary. "
"138000","143260"," Yeah, the, the, the gross, we were talking about the groceries, right?"
"143460","148940"," About a week ago, we were talking about how I went out grocery shopping to a few different grocery"
"148940","149720"," stores."
"150540","151600"," Mary just brought that up."
"151740","154580"," I can't believe the, the inflation. "
"155100","156580"," I, we'll talk about that today too."
"156660","157560"," We get a minute here today."
"157700","158240"," We'll talk about inflation. "
"159120","159360"," It's wild."
"159360","162760"," I, I brought a house that I had a business plan for."
"164820","167740"," And I wrote the business plan when we had some high inflation. "
"168400","169720"," It's insane right now."
"170560","171080"," It's double."
"172260","173260"," And that's with no pitfalls. "
"174920","176580"," It's, it's, it's so razor thing."
"176760","177760"," And I can't pass that along."
"177940","181760"," If I ever had to, I was talking to Joe Doney yesterday, I said, if I have to turn that"
"181760","184760"," house, I don't, that'll keep it right. "
"185800","190600"," I want to keep it, but if I have to have the liquid in it upside down, we no way,"
"190760","200800"," no way for me to, to realize my realized games, it's,"
"200880","205400"," it's, it's not, you know, of course you've got taxes associated if it don't hold up for two years"
"205400","205800"," or whatever."
"206020","208900"," And it's, it's not a win-win."
"208940","212020"," But it's definitely used to hold the situation. "
"214180","215400"," So we'll switch over right now."
"216200","221020"," I haven't moved any of the, the support levels yet on this chart."
"221200","222080"," It's not really transferring. "
"224440","232980"," We'll take a look down so put some new support and resistances in this morning."
"233920","237360"," We know that, uh, support is general."
"237760","240180"," We'll talk about down here. "
"240360","245680"," There's some support in down here as well, like 436, 437."
"246200","247520"," We already know about this somewhere in here."
"248680","249620"," Call it right here. "
"250820","253020"," Matter of fact, we'll get rid of this one, whatever that line is."
"257360","259019"," We'll turn this one under a yellow one."
"263040","264960"," We know the collars down here, 434. "
"267040","268160"," Well, we'll look at this."
"268720","269300"," Look at this."
"269720","270740"," It's interesting too. "
"270840","273020"," This is the same line from yesterday."
"273140","280180"," We bounced, we ricocheted right off at this morning to make this S1."
"281120","285000"," We already know that our two is up here at like 445 or so. "
"287160","288400"," That's some pretty big resistance."
"288700","293560"," We talked about that yesterday at the end of the day."
"293560","297300"," I would like to see a step, the 450 still still on the 450 train. "
"297660","302840"," You know, like whenever you're trying to hold a short or take a short position on the market, you"
"302840","306380"," know, you end up taking like the first one and the better one was here, right?"
"306540","307560"," So look, my cursor right here."
"308080","309260"," You think this is it?"
"309860","316020"," In reality, it was up here and I'm always looking for that kind of a, um, I don't have S2s"
"316020","316680"," in here or not."
"316760","317220"," We'll take a look. "
"319340","320500"," There's S2 down there."
"320500","324800"," There should be some decent support down here."
"325100","326360"," I think this can break though. "
"326580","327900"," We can come down here and hit this channel."
"328080","329700"," We'll look at, look at the economic calendar."
"329860","331180"," We got some more stuff coming out today. "
"332100","336080"," You can see, I may have been showing you guys this for a couple of weeks now, posting this on,"
"336080","340400"," uh, yeah, R3s somewhere up in here."
"343120","346840"," R4s somewhere, maybe slightly lower, but the GPM collars down here."
"347420","351140"," There's one thing to note this morning is that you can see, you know, as we, as we come down,"
"351580","353860"," you're starting to see a coiling down here. "
"354440","359300"," Uh, my assumption is it's going to be a trade higher and not the trade lower."
"359580","365300"," We might get a brief moment of weakness here, or we do a technical touchdown below."
"366280","371220"," Uh, the concern here is, or the thing that we'll be watching today is if you're not in the discord"
"371220","377980"," watching the options flow today, you need to because today and tomorrow, I think we have expiries"
"377980","382340"," today and tomorrow, uh, because we have Friday off of the holiday weekend. "
"383640","389320"," The key would be that as these puts that are in the money or deep in the money expire, uh,"
"389480","394960"," the hope is that, uh, most of these puts are taken for profit at some time, even with all the"
"394960","396340"," doom and gloom that you'll hear today and tomorrow."
"396860","403140"," Usually it's weird because usually you'll get like maybe a fast move down and then you'll get, uh,"
"403740","407920"," uh, the realization of profit from those puts as they expire."
"407980","412700"," And then if you figure who's going to hold puts over the weekend, you take the money and run. "
"412700","414420"," This is a nice move down here."
"414780","417500"," It's been going on since the 29th, right?"
"418580","423000"," So 13, 14 days of down moves, very profitable."
"424440","430100"," And as those puts roll off the market, well, we should see a spike higher today tomorrow Monday. "
"430840","431780"," How do you trade that?"
"431940","435620"," It's hard because it could come today because tomorrow might not be realized till Monday."
"435820","441120"," The key is to find a low, if you can, grab some call spreads expire either Friday or expire on"
"441120","443580"," Monday, and you make the decision when you're going to close them out."
"443660","449320"," Some of the money call spreads at some point today and tomorrow on a low and see if they can"
"449320","450180"," print for you. "
"450540","455480"," Now with that being said, uh, we should we have a, we've implied move to anything of like 1.6,"
"455700","461140"," 1.7%. There should be some large moves here, uh, this morning, and you can kind of see why now,"
"461140","465860"," though what I'm saying to you about discord is they should keep your eyes on the options."
"465880","466260"," Slow."
"466580","472180"," If we don't see continued hedging and put buying today, uh, that would give you the nod that we're"
"472180","473040"," going to go higher today. "
"474140","475520"," So be conscious of that."
"475640","482240"," If you do sit, though, see, uh, the more puts being bought or if you see, uh, futures being"
"482240","486560"," shorted, right on a farther out contract, uh, we should go lower."
"486780","491400"," And my overall take in the market right now is still bearish. "
"491940","494340"," Um, my take on the market is still bearish."
"495640","502960"," I'm looking for a rejection for a better positioning at 445, possibly 450 for the next leg down."
"503380","509260"," And that, it's further backed up by just, just by looking at the market breath indicator, forget"
"509260","512440"," all the news that you're hearing out there, forget all the headline news that's out there right"
"512440","512659"," now. "
"513020","514820"," Just know that the market is rolling."
"514940","518320"," It's, it's rotating, but also rolling over at the same time."
"519580","521200"," Even if you're a bull, just be aware of that. "
"521620","522760"," What do we know where the price is?"
"522940","523020"," No."
"523179","524520"," Does it matter where the price lines up?"
"524740","527020"," Well, winds up once we do liquidate?"
"527300","531720"," No, the only thing that matters is that you know where that where that moment is and what that you"
"531720","534260"," can safely take along at that time."
"535540","536940"," And we're almost there. "
"537080","542080"," So when we get there, we're going to be throwing on some June, uh, some June spreads, right?"
"542220","547440"," That's going to come on to the, I'm going to post that live live stream and imposed it on Captain"
"547440","548480"," Captain's trades."
"549640","552500"," That'll be your first trade for this year, right?"
"552640","553260"," We're going to hopefully trade."
"553380","558420"," If we can get them in this year, we'll get 10 trades in this year in relative safety for 100 "
"558420","562660","% print, probably a month, like two or 300% print and we'll call them at like 100% so"
"562660","565680"," we're not fucking with the market when we place those trades. "
"566520","567600"," Uh, but we're almost there."
"567680","568600"," We're getting close, which is good."
"568760","570620"," If you're a bull, uh, be happy, right?"
"570960","574480"," We know that the market environment that we're in that we're going to have to buy bottoms and we're"
"574480","575120"," going to sell tops. "
"575340","576980"," We're not getting to all time highs."
"576980","578580"," We know that we know the regime."
"579040","584760"," We know that everybody's thought process is that don't don't be expecting all time highs early this"
"584760","586380"," year, first three quarters, let's say. "
"586600","589760"," And we know that if we do hit all time highs at any point this year, it's going to roll"
"589760","590340"," hard, right?"
"591640","592700"," We're aware of that."
"593020","597940"," We know that the noise that we find in social media, the news is not always accurate, but we also"
"597940","604360"," know that, um, that the general consensus tends to work itself out."
"604460","605300"," We can see it right here. "
"605300","607520"," We're still rolling over down here, right?"
"608160","611980"," Still rolling over, still looking for that green by zone down here, 250."
"612960","614360"," And when we've seen this, right?"
"614700","618340"," We remember we started talking about this and we were up here with the follow my cursor right here."
"618640","620700"," You remember right up here, we started following this way. "
"620740","626020"," I said to you, you will start to see, uh, less breadth to the market and we have come down"
"626020","628140"," and we'll continue to go down."
"628240","633500"," And so we have that, that quick moment, that quick first down, it'll be safe for us to buy some"
"633500","636120"," kind of a longer and over so oversold type condition."
"638520","641000"," So next, we're going to look at the economic calendar for today. "
"641000","642120"," We already know what the PPI numbers are."
"642260","642800"," They're hot, right?"
"643280","644900"," I post that this morning on Twitter for you."
"645400","650440"," Um, you saw how hot they were with 10 year ball bond auction coming up at 9 30. "
"652560","655100"," And then I think we've got some oil stuff later on today too."
"655220","657840"," I'm assuming that there's some, that might not be in here."
"657900","658960"," I'm not seeing the oil stuff. "
"659120","660400"," I think that's in there like 10 30."
"661140","662840"," That's not, for some reason, it's not in here."
"662960","664760"," It's say the 13th, right?"
"665440","667240"," I don't know why it's not on this, the second on my calendar. "
"667280","669440"," I haven't used, uh, in quite some time."
"669700","675140"," I think we also have, uh, we also have, uh, some, some Fed speakers coming out today."
"675220","676320"," I want to say at 12 30. "
"676980","680040"," Oh, I'm, I'm looking at the wrong, uh, give me a second here."
"680340","681780"," I'm going to do a different economic calendar."
"687390","690470"," Maybe I'm a, maybe I'm a, I'm looking at the wrong one, maybe. "
"692390","694530"," So we had CPI at 8 30, right?"
"695190","696990"," We've got, uh, wrong one."
"697430","701080"," We look at PPI right here."
"701180","701840"," This shows PPI. "
"702080","705540"," I'll find the, the times, but we've got another Fed speaker today at like 12 30."
"705720","708980"," We've got some oil news, uh, at 10 30 this morning."
"709200","710460"," So be careful if you're in oil trades. "
"710820","715680"," Uh, you might want to step away from those around 10 15 or so and then get back into around"
"715680","716260"," 11 45."
"716920","720020"," Uh, one key thing though, is we've got retail sales on Thursday."
"720520","725020"," So whenever trades that you're making, just be conscious of retail sales, retail sales can be very"
"725020","725460"," dangerous. "
"725800","728880"," Uh, a very dangerous trade is a bull, uh, the market can flip."
"729020","734700"," So let's say today we went up until we go up today, we, we snap higher, and then, uh, we're"
"734700","735640"," weak into tomorrow."
"735640","739040"," So any kind of a trade that you're in today, consider closing them. "
"739180","744480"," I know I say buy some call spreads or at least diamond hand them into Friday that we're considering"
"744480","749760"," maybe even just waiting and taking, seeing how today plays out, maybe even just taking, uh, a call"
"749760","752860"," spread on weakness generated from retail sales tomorrow."
"754200","757520"," Uh, because this is the thing, retail sales is, this is going to show tomorrow."
"758180","763540"," Uh, Mary was talking about, uh, to a grocery shop and couldn't believe the price of goods. "
"764620","768740"," This will show if there's any impact right now on what you're spending your money on."
"769060","774780"," Are you still spending money out there going to Disneyland and partying with your friends, or are"
"774780","779500"," you saying, I'm going to, I'm going to buy that cream cheese that's three times the price, or am I"
"779500","781140"," going to buy the knockoff brand?"
"781320","787720"," Am I going to, uh, stop spending money on steak and start buying spam, you know, just using this as"
"787720","792680"," a, as a silica, but, uh, just so you have that idea of retail sales coming out tomorrow, eight"
"792680","795740"," thirty, the morning be conscience of that on the economic calendar."
"796780","800760"," Spock, every point this morning, futures have bounced back up to four forty two, zero. "
"801720","803860"," Vol estimate for today comes in higher versus yesterday."
"804480","809540"," So that move yesterday was nothing compared to a one point five four percent, uh, is the figure for"
"809540","809760"," today."
"810620","814000"," There also remains a heavy, uh, negative game position, both buying and queues. "
"815420","816440"," I want to talk about that too."
"816540","821080"," The queues have a, remember we had that, uh, huge bounce last time in the queues when we finally"
"821080","821780"," came back up."
"822120","826780"," If you're able to time a bounce, uh, in the market coming up here, it's this week, next week,"
"826800","832220"," whenever, if you don't want to trade the spy, you could trade the queues for even better gains. "
"832520","835700"," If you're going to follow me on that trade and you want to trade the queues, that might even be"
"835700","840840"," a better trade than the spy must be aware of that as well because of the steep selloffs and the"
"840840","845860"," steep spikes in the cues we talked about that yesterday, uh, that you should be buying the cues"
"845860","852020"," when they bottom out rather than value when they bottom out and value in the cues and spy all go"
"852020","857780"," up together and down together, generally when market, when the market conditions move together in"
"857780","858360"," unison, right?"
"858700","864140"," Not in the rotation trade, but in the up and downs of the market that you're going to still see"
"864140","866300"," better gains out of the cues than you are in the value trade."
"867960","871240"," Resistance holds, uh, at 4, 4, 5, 0."
"871380","872780"," So not quite 4, 5, 0."
"873160","879340"," So you may want to close longs if you pull one today slightly below 4, 4, 5, not 4, 4,"
"879680","882980"," uh, not 4, uh, not 4, uh, not 4, uh, 50, right?"
"883560","885100"," We're talking about that for 50 up here."
"885640","888760"," 4, 4, 5 here is the actual, uh, upper resistance, right?"
"891310","892330"," Yesterday's flow was quite interesting. "
"892590","896830"," We saw it on the 20k each of puts and calls added to the 4, 4, 5 and over 445 "
"896830","900310",",000 puts trading at the 440, uh, strike, right?"
"900590","905630"," Yesterday, remember we were seeing the yesterday we're seeing right in here, we were watching, uh,"
"905870","912710"," the hero indicator showing call buyers and I kept noting to you yesterday that, uh, someone was"
"912710","919830"," coming in and buying 440p yesterday, like big, big, big positions of 440p, uh, for yesterday's"
"919830","924490"," strike and Friday's strike, uh, in the market yesterday, which was completely against, remember,"
"924570","929110"," remember we were forming that bull flag yesterday and I'm like, if we shouldn't be, this bull flag"
"929110","933870"," is going to fail because someone's in there, uh, pushing the system, right?"
"934050","938070"," Someone in there with his hand on the scale, uh, rolling it over yesterday, and sure enough, that's"
"938070","939710"," what took place at the end of the day."
"940390","945590"," Despite this very large volume, open interest at the 440 put line went down 3,000."
"946190","950970"," Generally, you'd expect large change and open interest when there is such large volume and because"
"950970","955630"," this didn't happen, we're closing up large positions, right?"
"955790","957430"," That's this day trading thing that we've been doing, right?"
"957810","961670"," You're watching the market, the gamma and delta that's out there and then you're watching day"
"961670","965830"," traders come in and basically manipulate the market to where they want it to be. "
"966390","968830"," This could, this probably isn't high frequency trading firms."
"969290","971050"," This is probably large banks doing this, okay?"
"971870","975350"," Uh, here, it could be fucking soft, uh, uh, soft bank for all we know."
"975630","980070"," Here it may, uh, have been traded, but maybe everyone's figuring out that day trading is where"
"980070","980650"," everything is at. "
"981830","983170"," Maybe got four minutes to the open."
"983610","986870"," Here it may have been traded versus another fund instead of a dealer or a market maker."
"987010","987410"," There you go. "
"987910","992010"," As it was, as if it was a large fund closing out versus a dealer, we'd likely see an open"
"992010","993110"," interest decline sharply."
"993970","995010"," That's a key point, right?"
"995150","996910"," You'll, you'll start to see these puts get closed."
"997410","1001810"," Regardless, uh, 440 spy reminds the main feature of the S&P 500 layout I've seen below. "
"1002450","1007230"," We now face back to back exploration so the S&P and the queues were in, uh, equal to a"
"1007230","1015250"," greater than 43% total SPX spy, uh, queues, gamut expires, uh, 20% per expiry."
"1015390","1016570"," It's 20% per expiry."
"1017090","1021490"," The put heavy gamut is expiring and in the short term, it's a supportive, uh, supportive of markets"
"1021490","1023109"," due to related ban, China flows. "
"1023369","1026730"," They had simply put their expiring as a jailers, like the buybacks and futures."
"1026990","1029690"," So you, as you see these puts being closed, right?"
"1030069","1033190"," Talked about JPM caller and people that follow the JPM caller."
"1033750","1038690"," Those people if they close or day traders that are trading puts closing for, plays closing for"
"1038690","1042770"," profit, uh, you'll see dealers impact of a pump higher. "
"1042930","1046470"," That's the pump that you're going to get is the dealers on your side against these banks."
"1047130","1051170"," On this point, you've been watching short-dated implied IV, blows the at the money spy IV, which,"
"1051250","1054710"," uh, which each point represents a different exploration, 10 days of exploration and purple."
"1056050","1059470"," Skilled up to 30 days in yellow, because 30 days, right?"
"1060470","1062230"," And this is 10 days down here. "
"1062310","1063530"," You can see this, this move."
"1065110","1067650"," It's all this purple concentration down here, right?"
"1067830","1068450"," All expiring."
"1069650","1074650"," Uh, when market worries set in term structure shifts flat or backward dates, purple is greater than"
"1074650","1076390"," yellow, right?"
"1076630","1080270"," As you can see, IV is elevated from earlier this month when there's STX test at 4600, then"
"1080270","1082030"," brainers, hawkish comments, drop stocks. "
"1082250","1086370"," We think spider notes again yesterday that traders are not going to want to carry many short-dated"
"1086370","1088830"," puts over the next two days into the long weekend."
"1089590","1094230"," Therefore, a very short day of IV will likely come to play over for sale plus the back-to-back"
"1094230","1094530"," exploration."
"1094630","1095670"," This is a VANET component. "
"1096610","1098390"," So the VANET trade is possibly on."
"1099070","1103150"," Let's give this a bullish edge into tomorrow's monthly aspect, OPEX, and we think that this puts"
"1103150","1107330"," intraput interest removal takes away some of the market support for next week."
"1108970","1110770"," So look at this key here, okay?"
"1112290","1117270"," So you've got a bullish edge heading into Friday, but then this put interest removal takes away"
"1117820","1120090"," some of the market support for next week. "
"1120410","1124010"," So you might see a Venerali today, tomorrow, possibly even into the open of Monday."
"1124610","1126210"," That depends on where we wind up, right?"
"1126310","1134410"," If we hit 4500 or 440, today or tomorrow, I'd probably take those spreads off before we get into"
"1134410","1135790"," the close of Friday or Monday."
"1137010","1140250"," In case you are weak, heading into next week. "
"1141010","1142370"," So be conscious of that."
"1142470","1146490"," So we might be able to get a relief rally today tomorrow and then we start heading back down again"
"1146490","1147530"," come Monday."
"1152650","1154170"," So you're finding some nice support here. "
"1154170","1155350"," We got this nice bounce and a close."
"1155750","1158470"," Yesterday we talked about closing your calls before the bell yesterday."
"1158970","1160070"," I hope that you're able to close. "
"1160230","1162030"," We got 26 seconds until the open here."
"1162650","1167130"," I'm going to bring up the, and you see this down below here."
"1167470","1174150"," I do want to show you real quick what I'm looking for right down here. "
"1174310","1178190"," But if we can get right, if we can get any kind of a bounce down below, retest of this"
"1178190","1183850"," low from yesterday would be nice, even maybe a dip slightly lower than grab that to go long today."
"1184270","1189470"," So if you can find put holders trying to take profit down here, if they're saying, please, please,"
"1189470","1194750"," please, please give me, please, please, please print my puts one last time."
"1195510","1195910"," Right?"
"1196370","1199510"," And then we get to go higher or they just panic and start to sell. "
"1201490","1202750"," So we're at the open now."
"1203050","1205870"," Let me see if I can get some nice support right off the bell here."
"1206450","1209870"," We'll wait to see as this develops and see what's going to happen here. "
"1212810","1214410"," Give the market just a few minutes."
"1214410","1223130"," I'm going to check, I'm going to check the options chain right now."
"1226680","1229660"," There is some interest, Carly at 431p for today. "
"1230240","1232380"," A thousand contracts are 10 cents."
"1233140","1241480"," A thousand contracts right off the opening bell at 431p expiry today, 413, April 13th."
"1241620","1241740"," Okay. "
"1243440","1245260"," We'll see how well those hold up."
"1249570","1251110"," Those are now up at 14 cents."
"1252350","1253450"," They're gone again. "
"1253790","1255310"," So we've got HFCs in here."
"1255770","1257470"," I love the HFCs in the morning."
"1258890","1261090"," First five minutes, they're in and out. "
"1264050","1265830"," Now now up to 15 cents."
"1266850","1268890"," They're in for like, they're in for like two minutes."
"1269830","1270550"," Then they got out. "
"1270790","1275890"," Now we've got a HFCs still loading up now on 438, 437p bouncing around."
"1276310","1279490"," I don't see any high frequency traders on the call side."
"1279490","1282490"," There's a split a little bit on 445c. "
"1282630","1283670"," Those are only six cents."
"1284250","1286230"," So you can probably do a split at this point."
"1286870","1289270"," There's some dirt cheap calls and puts out there. "
"1289610","1294010"," You've got 445c's at six cents right now, seven cents right."
"1295030","1303950"," And then you could grab some, maybe some puts on, let's call it, 433 for 29 cents"
"1303950","1309790"," by both sides and run them both you'd have done the call side."
"1309910","1312010"," You wouldn't have to make much to beat out the put side. "
"1313470","1316670"," And then the put side of course probably the whole diamond hand those."
"1317650","1321470"," That's a pretty good trade for this morning as a is a straddle on the market."
"1323270","1325310"," Buy both sides and find out which way we're headed. "
"1330790","1332450"," Oh yeah, I do want to warn you this morning."
"1333590","1336430"," I do want to, yeah, we can get some gaps to four, four."
"1336610","1338830"," I like the 443 and the 451, Paul. "
"1339790","1340810"," But if you are, good morning everybody."
"1341030","1341550"," Good morning, talk."
"1342870","1349190"," If you do want to be conscious this morning, let me take a look at my place of trade myself. "
"1353320","1356100"," Still some bears loading up on puts there at 437."
"1358650","1359950"," Boy, I do like that."
"1360090","1361870"," I do like that 443 trade. "
"1364470","1365910"," I do like that trade."
"1370590","1371430"," Just a second here."
"1371490","1373690"," I'm gonna slap some money on. "
"1382760","1383760"," I'm just a second here."
"1386820","1388560"," Just patience here for a minute."
"1389400","1394480"," Let me see if I can, uh, I'm gonna reset this flow so we can see the bullish indicator, bearish"
"1394480","1394700"," indicator. "
"1402500","1404380"," We'll refresh this page here."
"1411010","1412210"," Just give me a second here."
"1412290","1414050"," I'm waiting for a nice, nice entry point. "
"1414170","1415150"," I'm going to buy some calls here."
"1438120","1443920"," So I want you to be aware this morning that there are some bears holding 437 peas, about 7,000"
"1443920","1446160"," contracts on 437 piece."
"1446300","1448860"," That is the trade, right?"
"1449340","1457240"," I bought 443s, seas, calls, anticipating that bears are gonna end up being forced to close their"
"1457240","1457560"," positions. "
"1458140","1459660"," That the dealer flow is gonna help me."
"1460060","1461120"," I bought them at 20 cents."
"1461920","1463520"," So I've got 443s, seas. "
"1464560","1469960"," We'll see how the, I'll probably diamond-hand those throughout the day until we trade higher here."
"1469960","1472020"," I don't care."
"1472440","1474440"," At this point at 20 cents, they're so cheap. "
"1475300","1483320"," With some resistance above here at 439.50 and then again at, uh, 440.50. We'll look above here."
"1483700","1484300"," There's gonna be a grind."
"1484560","1487980"," You can see that there's a little bit of a planning action going on right off the bell so far. "
"1488500","1490860"," Uh, some, some resistance from the bears."
"1491380","1494920"," They're gonna want to get that retest down below, retest yesterday's numbers."
"1496680","1499020"," We'll see if they, we'll see if they get those at this point. "
"1507000","1510600"," Now we'll see if we can break, break through these sellers here and move higher."
"1510860","1518640"," We might get a rejection, uh, right here or here you can see this 445, 43, uh, 9.50. You"
"1518640","1520780"," might get some rejection in a retest."
"1521160","1523860"," Uh, but I do think that vantage rate is on for today. "
"1523860","1528120"," I think that the, um, realization of puts, I think bears have had their full advantage."
"1528380","1528740"," A ton of money."
"1528740","1530520"," Watching apple calls come in right now. "
"1530560","1531480"," Tesla calls come in."
"1532220","1533020"," Highlight of the score."
"1533120","1535920"," Tesla calls April 22nd, 10.50. C's. "
"1536500","1537580"," Million dollars, baby."
"1538980","1541100"," Apple calls April 14th."
"1542740","1547600"," 167.5. Uh, April 14th for a couple hundred thousand dollars. "
"1547960","1549260"," AMD calls and puts."
"1549920","1550600"," AMD is kind of weird."
"1550760","1553000"," It's getting mixed messages on AMD right now. "
"1553680","1560040"," Uh, those print, print, print."
"1576840","1577460"," All right."
"1578620","1580000"," So good morning, everybody. "
"1580260","1580880"," We'll take a look here."
"1586500","1589680"," Do a nice quick little, nice, quick little bounce up here."
"1590580","1592180"," I want to take some profit off here. "
"1592300","1598100"," We're right around 27 about almost getting close to 50% profit on that quick trade off the bell."
"1599220","1604540"," If we see some quick profit taking here and then maybe a quick bounce down to retest, I don't know"
"1604540","1610760"," if that'll happen at this point, but we might get some kind of resistance in here and it is where"
"1610760","1612460"," your volatility is currently."
"1616100","1619280"," You might, we might get one rejection down and then move higher. "
"1619680","1623200"," If you're able to break through right away, you might find something like this and then I move"
"1623200","1623500"," higher."
"1624440","1628240"," So we'll see how this plays itself out for the rest of today."
"1628360","1630900"," So this is the plan for this morning so far. "
"1631680","1637480"," Now, if you are bearish here, we've already talked about where you should be looking for some"
"1637480","1641220"," resistance, this is kind of point one right here, right?"
"1641300","1642580"," I feel like I'm going to get bearish cap."
"1642780","1643900"," I don't want to hear anything you have to say."
"1644280","1647120"," This is one right somewhere up in here, probably slightly lower. "
"1647800","1650120"," We know that Spock Anna's calling it 4-4."
"1650520","1654840"," I don't know if it's 4-4-5, zero, but you could, you know, take some off right up in"
"1654840","1655060"," here."
"1655980","1662460"," If you want, if we end up trading higher than here today and you're like, oh shit, I'm fucked up"
"1662460","1662800"," cap. "
"1664260","1672040"," We'll look as the day develops and see if there's a larger resistance zone here and where your next"
"1672040","1672800"," short would be."
"1673320","1677860"," So we'll close out there for a minute and we'll put this on here."
"1681680","1685220"," Yeah, this is our one somewhere like 4-43 or so. "
"1685360","1690020"," We'll take a look at this better on somewhere in there, I think, right there."
"1690780","1693560"," But your next, your next trade is way higher, bro."
"1693800","1695220"," It's 4, let me go. "
"1699430","1701470"," This is the game up here, right?"
"1701670","1705590"," If you can get past this 4-45, this is where the sweetness is."
"1705830","1709790"," If you want like a sweet place to take a short, this is where I want to take a short"
"1709790","1710190"," right here."
"1711710","1713110"," I'm going to take this short right here. "
"1714010","1715550"," And I was hoping that we'd get this, right?"
"1716330","1717870"," Or yesterday, that's what you were hoping."
"1718010","1719350"," I said close this shit yesterday."
"1719890","1720810"," Like hell, no. "
"1724840","1727080"," I get that nice resistance up above."
"1727220","1730480"," This resistance zone here is 4-40-48."
"1730720","1733080"," Keep note of that one as well, 4-40-48. "
"1735860","1740400"," So right up in here, make a little note, 4-40."
"1741800","1743040"," How many of you think we need to do that?"
"1744560","1745660"," Let's do it like this."
"1750080","1751220"," That's about it right there. "
"1757020","1758160"," Get nice and small."
"1761700","1763040"," Somewhere sneaky peatin' there."
"1767730","1769750"," And there it is right there, 4-40-50. "
"1769990","1771570"," You'll see that little bit of resistance there."
"1772410","1774230"," A little bit of resistance right in here."
"1779420","1781820"," All right, that's the reason you guys are commenting this morning. "
"1782020","1782560"," We have a sip of coffee."
"1786780","1787920"," It's almost Friday, right?"
"1788360","1789060"," We have one more day left."
"1792180","1795200"," Your rice boyfriend's saying, Andy, is going under 90 at some point this month. "
"1795320","1797300"," Have you accepted any more for Captain Strades?"
"1797400","1798600"," No, I haven't taken a look at it."
"1798940","1800920"," I'll take a look at it this morning though."
"1801180","1806080"," I'll take a look over on that Captain Strades and get everybody rolled in. "
"1806120","1807100"," I'll definitely do it right now."
"1807460","1807940"," I think I can."
"1816320","1818820"," Let's see if I can do that right now. "
"1819680","1820460"," Just a second."
"1853890","1854610"," Yeah, I don't."
"1854890","1855310"," It's weird. "
"1855470","1856150"," I don't have my password."
"1858860","1869140"," I think I"
"1871410","1874830"," logged in on a different handle, so I'll get back to it."
"1875910","1879430"," I'll log in later on today under a different computer. "
"1880430","1885310"," I think I logged in under a different email address, so I'll take a look at it earlier today."
"1886130","1888410"," Still trading higher right now, breaking through that resistance."
"1889410","1891030"," I called out a trade for you. "
"1891430","1892990"," We are printing at this point."
"1895130","1896450"," Let's take a look at those calls."
"1897130","1898350"," And now it's a 31 cents. "
"1898610","1900750"," They were at 20 cents earlier now, 33 cents."
"1901350","1902290"," Hopefully, we're making some money."
"1902530","1903010"," Good morning. "
"1910490","1913450"," Yeah, I'll give you a simple explanation of a Vanirale."
"1914490","1915430"," I'll give you the basic."
"1915710","1921090"," So, if you ever hear people talking about Vanirales, basically, it's just puts being closed, shorts"
"1921090","1928990"," being closed, plus puts being closed for profit, and then dealers no longer having to hedge those"
"1928990","1929910"," short positions. "
"1930850","1936050"," So, when they no longer hedge those short positions, now that rally can be fueled two ways."
"1936610","1938830"," It can be fueled, but you've got Vanen charm."
"1939050","1941550"," You've got two ways that that rally is fueled. "
"1941850","1947810"," You've got the first piece of that puzzle, which is dealers that no longer have to cover shorts and"
"1947810","1948010"," puts."
"1949890","1955830"," So, you've got that dealer effect on the market where we trade higher due to the closing of puts"
"1955830","1957610"," for profit."
"1958970","1960390"," It's very simple. "
"1960970","1968410"," The second part of that rally is the inclusion of bulls buying calls, or even bulls and bears"
"1968410","1971090"," buying calls, or traders bulls and bears buying calls."
"1971710","1973810"," Now, there's two fuels that fire, right?"
"1975010","1984570"," If you only get the closing of puts for profit, but you only get day traders and bulls saying,"
"1984570","1990290"," well, I know we can only go to 445, or I think we can only go to 450, and I"
"1990290","1997590"," think we can only do it today, or tomorrow, you miss part of that trade, right?"
"1998110","2003170"," If you remember how that trade went back in the day, if you look back in the 2020 and 2021,"
"2004090","2006470"," you would get both parts of that rally."
"2007350","2013570"," So, you would first see the first three, four huge days of a move higher, and then you would see"
"2013570","2018910"," lower volatility in a positive game environment, and then we would slowly grind higher until those"
"2018910","2020610"," calls were printed or realized. "
"2020990","2023690"," The first batch were realized for gains."
"2024130","2026490"," We still need more call buyers to jump into the market."
"2027870","2032270"," But anyway, my point being is that you'd see two aspects to that rally. "
"2032490","2039710"," You'd see the initial push higher, and then you'd see positive gamma, and the key behind that trade"
"2039710","2045810"," when you get both parts to it is that investors and traders are positive in their outlook."
"2046230","2050810"," So, you might say, well, you know what, Cap, I think we're going all time highs again, right?"
"2052070","2053929"," And so, I feel comfortable right here."
"2054370","2062350"," Buying, let's say today, you bought the Spy 460s, or 470s, or 480s that are dated one through two,"
"2062610","2066370"," three months out because you're not trading in fear, investing in fear. "
"2066830","2071530"," Right now, everybody's trading and investing in a fear-laced environment."
"2072130","2075050"," So, you're not getting the two parts to that trade."
"2076350","2081690"," And furthermore, once that trade is over right now, once we get the two, three-day rally, you're"
"2081690","2085110"," not seeing much of an extension of it. "
"2086409","2089690"," Unless it's a completely overbought environment."
"2090449","2094190"," We saw that last time we saw a nice big huge push up."
"2095929","2098790"," We saw this big huge push up here, right?"
"2099170","2100370"," This is an extended rally. "
"2100950","2106250"," But the neat part about this rally, for you to remember, is that most people did not participate in"
"2106250","2107590"," this part of the rally."
"2108930","2112130"," This was banks and institutions and not retail traders."
"2112570","2117190"," If you recall, when we were talking about this move higher, that no one believed we were going"
"2117190","2117750"," higher here. "
"2118250","2125010"," And we noticed even the call buying in this area here was all led by institutions, not by retail"
"2125010","2125450"," traders."
"2125970","2128930"," Retail traders had no problem taking this trade, but it petered out."
"2129430","2132490"," And once the institutions were done, we continued to roll over. "
"2132930","2137970"," And the key being is this, is that the key being is, let me show it to you right here."
"2138670","2142170"," So you'd have that initial VANA plus charm rally, right?"
"2142790","2145150"," Then we got institutions buying right here."
"2145570","2152230"," Now, if we had call buyers that had bought out into late March, April, that they're looking towards"
"2152230","2156730"," a positive Fed meeting, you would see a slow grind, believe it or not, higher. "
"2157070","2160950"," You might get some pullbacks on OPEXs and stuff like that, right?"
"2161410","2165170"," But the reason why we didn't go higher here, generally speaking, is that because everybody knows"
"2165170","2166370"," we're not going higher, right?"
"2167090","2169050"," And that's kind of the same, but it's not the same."
"2169270","2171930"," It doesn't apply technically where we are right now."
"2172270","2177810"," We know that we'll have, if not now later, we'll still get a retest down below probably a 4,000. "
"2178110","2181510"," This could be anywhere from now into May 18th."
"2181970","2188170"," So any trade higher right now is only a trade where it's where the market makers and the dealers"
"2188170","2189890"," are covering right now, right?"
"2190470","2195030"," Or not covering their reducing their exposure downside risk."
"2195510","2200790"," But then this gives the chance for bears to take another short position. "
"2201470","2204890"," They don't want bears, believe it or not, great money here."
"2205050","2212730"," So bears want another opportunity either here or up here to take another short down to this 420, if"
"2212730","2214290"," not 4,000, right?"
"2214890","2215290"," Even lower."
"2216290","2218590"," So that's the thought process behind this. "
"2218710","2220070"," Where do you enter your next short?"
"2220710","2222950"," So let's say you're like, well, I'm super bullish cap."
"2223130","2224390"," I think we're going to all-time highs right here."
"2224830","2234750"," You won't see positive gamma until you get above 450, 456 or so,"
"2235070","2237510"," you'll start to enter some positive gamma up here again. "
"2237990","2239090"," It's actually much higher."
"2239650","2245950"," I want to bet if they're saying it's 450, but I bet positive gamma is somewhere above 4, maybe even"
"2245950","2247190"," 462 at this point."
"2247570","2249850"," Everybody seems to know that this is the top up here, right?"
"2250410","2251730"," Everybody knows, everybody knows. "
"2252370","2254970"," So where do bears take short?"
"2255190","2256250"," They took short up here."
"2256730","2261330"," They're probably going to take short somewhere in here in this vicinity again, right?"
"2262330","2267870"," And unless you squeeze them up higher and outside of this channel, of this negative corrective"
"2267870","2272470"," channel that we're in, this is where they're looking to get back in again."
"2273030","2274150"," And even bulls know this, right?"
"2274310","2278470"," But you guys know, as a bull, you're more scared than you were in the last few years, right?"
"2278870","2280230"," Of the market right now. "
"2280690","2283550"," So it's not like this is an unknown."
"2284470","2286610"," And the markets just don't go straight down."
"2286770","2287390"," They just don't. "
"2287810","2290050"," I know you want to think that it goes straight down."
"2290410","2292770"," Got this beautiful move still hot trading higher."
"2293290","2297530"," Now to step the 37 cents on those 443Cs. "
"2297710","2298310"," Great trade."
"2298730","2301170"," Probably going to close these out here quite soon."
"2301990","2303410"," Just be conscious of that. "
"2303750","2308350"," If you're in that trade, we are coming up to a resistance point right up in here."
"2308770","2310850"," So you can see that resistance up above."
"2313530","2316090"," Somewhere right in there, there's a little bit of resistance. "
"2316850","2318230"," Just be conscious of this resistance."
"2318990","2323370"," And if you wanted to take this trade even higher, you're going to look for what?"
"2323990","2325650"," Do we beat this, right?"
"2325910","2331910"," Then you take this next move up and you just step, step staircase it up and above until we begin"
"2331910","2336250"," to roll over at some point, either here or up in here."
"2337290","2338410"," It's a really good trade. "
"2339490","2340450"," We called it."
"2340790","2341570"," Yay, baby."
"2342350","2342910"," We called it. "
"2343230","2344610"," Another good day of trading."
"2347580","2349080"," Another good day of trading."
"2350140","2351260"," It's right in here. "
"2357480","2361300"," All right, I'm out for 38 cents on the 443Cs."
"2361680","2362820"," They were at 20 cents earlier."
"2363640","2367080"," 90 percent beautiful trade right there, right off the bell. "
"2367780","2370580"," 949, first trade of the day, 90 percent profit."
"2381250","2382170"," Good to see everybody."
"2383010","2384410"," Hope you're all making money out there. "
"2388460","2390000"," I'll say in RSA, I was going to melt up."
"2390000","2390540"," Look to it."
"2390740","2391740"," I'm going to see what you guys are saying here. "
"2394840","2404490"," You're getting better at the"
"2405290","2405790"," SATs."
"2407510","2415970"," I'm beside myself because your children, I don't know who has children out there, but there's a two"
"2415970","2421850"," sided, there's a two sidedness to children, right?"
"2422210","2424110"," Well, maybe even three sides."
"2424390","2431820"," Some children have some children struggle and it's not your fault. "
"2432040","2433880"," There's nothing you can do about it in life."
"2434100","2442720"," Some children, you can have a part in how their development and sometimes you can do the best thing"
"2442720","2443060"," in the world."
"2443480","2447080"," I've had friends, I remember growing up, I had, he realized it's to get older too, right?"
"2447260","2450940"," You have some friends that they could have been the smartest kid in the world and yet they fell in"
"2450940","2458200"," the drugs or had a friend in high school that broke his neck in a dirt bike accident, right?"
"2458660","2462340"," Then you have those friends in high school that fall off from Darwin Awards, right?"
"2462620","2464140"," Bad car crashes, that kind of stuff. "
"2464860","2469900"," Two always pitfalls as a parent for your children, right?"
"2470120","2473380"," And so, so far, I'm not going on some wood."
"2475060","2479200"," I can hopefully, she'll have a life that's better than mine."
"2479460","2488300"," Of course, that's what you want and she can take care of herself hopefully and be happy and she's"
"2488300","2488920"," doing those things. "
"2489540","2491100"," And you never know, right?"
"2491360","2494580"," And there's so much that there's so much that you don't have any power over."
"2494840","2498000"," That you give the best parent in the world and it doesn't matter, right?"
"2498100","2502420"," Or some calamity of the falls, you or your family or yourself or your children."
"2503940","2506920"," And I haven't encountered that yet. "
"2507560","2516060"," And I'm kind of beside myself, I was weeping this morning"
"2516060","2519200"," because I'm so proud of it."
"2519420","2521720"," It's like this like, it's a weird prad, like something kind of proud."
"2521720","2525560"," Like, baseball game, Slap Your Son's ass and say you did a good job at that home run. "
"2525680","2531380"," It's like this deep-seated gratitude that she's safe and she's intelligent."
"2532900","2537240"," And she didn't like playing sports, plays individual sports, like skiing and stuff like that, but"
"2537240","2537960"," never like team sports."
"2538500","2542020"," We made an agreement years ago where she said, oh, she goes, I love school. "
"2542660","2547820"," She's like, she's like, I'm not gonna play sports, but I really like school."
"2548040","2549120"," And I was like, I'll make a deal with you."
"2549880","2551820"," I put all of your effort into schooling. "
"2553080","2554120"," I like you with a sport."
"2554540","2555780"," And she's done that."
"2556040","2560280"," So I'm ecstatic. "
"2561120","2561820"," I'm ecstatic."
"2563860","2564420"," All right."
"2564460","2565100"," So we got here. "
"2565360","2569040"," I'm gonna go to the live tag, keep being on the winning call chat."
"2572740","2576400"," Yeah, like, you know, soccer games do the same thing, sports do the same thing, you know, it"
"2576700","2578240"," doesn't matter what the activity is."
"2578380","2581820"," Doesn't matter if it's sports, if it's schooling, it's that, you know what I mean?"
"2581860","2582420"," It's like that. "
"2583180","2584500"," It's like, it's like that."
"2584940","2585180"," I don't know."
"2585260","2585800"," You know what it is. "
"2586040","2587660"," I know that if you're a parent, you know what it is."
"2589820","2592500"," Because you know that they're gonna they're gonna encounter hard times in life."
"2592560","2594280"," You know that things are gonna go wrong for them in life. "
"2594700","2600480"," And you like want them to just have that foundation of sports doesn't matter if it's schooling"
"2600480","2606280"," doesn't matter if it's dance or theater or religion or whatever it is that you do for your"
"2606280","2606580"," children."
"2608080","2611780"," And that they have that they have something right they have that foundation in their life."
"2616290","2617350"," Yeah, I haven't done that yet. "
"2617570","2618850"," I sent my daughter off to college."
"2619290","2626070"," Good morning, everybody."
"2626070","2627970"," Question mark, is it good to start a spy short?"
"2628170","2630790"," I would say I was just talking about this briefly earlier. "
"2631030","2633910"," This is a good place to close those lungs from the bell, right?"
"2634210","2635390"," So close your lungs in here."
"2635790","2636890"," We'll talk about that again."
"2637210","2639850"," We'll review it one more time just for everybody to see. "
"2640830","2643790"," So we do have some some slight resistance in here."
"2643910","2647450"," Okay, we talked about the Vanarelli that should take place today."
"2648270","2650270"," We know we've got some vol in here, right?"
"2650910","2654150"," I think it was 44050, right?"
"2654150","2654850"," 4450. "
"2655870","2657710"," And slightly right here at 44000."
"2657830","2659510"," This is a ball right in here."
"2660770","2665030"," So if you're a bull, the first thing you do is you take this trade, which we did, right?"
"2665550","2666670"," Close it for profit. "
"2667330","2672310"," You wait to see as a bull if we break above this ball and you pick up the trade once"
"2672310","2675050"," more to 445, right?"
"2675490","2676470"," Not 443, but 445."
"2676930","2677470"," Who break above here?"
"2677610","2678370"," We're pretty bullish."
"2679130","2680090"," So we'll take that trade higher. "
"2680990","2683370"," So you get that first trade and that second trade."
"2683830","2687390"," We already explained why we should have a Vanarelli today of some kind."
"2687750","2693950"," We already know that at some point today we have an I or an implied move of 1.5%, so"
"2693950","2694910"," we should get a big move. "
"2695330","2697550"," This would be a confirmation of that big move, right?"
"2698250","2703510"," If you want to take a short today, right, you know all this information already, right?"
"2703690","2706970"," So if you do, you're looking to position, right?"
"2707110","2710430"," You're looking to find out where you should take a short, right?"
"2712050","2714950"," So you've got a few places that you can take your shorts, right?"
"2715810","2717030"," You can take one here."
"2717710","2722450"," You can take one here and you can take one right here, right?"
"2722590","2723910"," So you just put some stops on it."
"2723910","2726810"," If you're bearish, you're like, I've got, you're like, cap, we're going down. "
"2727450","2729830"," Today is the day, tomorrow is the day the bear is going to lean in."
"2729910","2731610"," Now I'm not seeing that flow right now."
"2731810","2735650"," You might see it, but if you are bearish, you're like, I want to take up short, right here cap,"
"2735970","2741570"," then just put your short on right now and if you just do tight stops above this line. "
"2741770","2744170"," If you start to see us trading higher, right?"
"2744250","2748390"," If we start trading higher here, you're going to cut your shorts loose."
"2749030","2751290"," If we then bounce around here, right?"
"2751530","2752630"," One two, right?"
"2753470","2754530"," One two, right?"
"2754730","2756150"," And then we start moving higher, right?"
"2756710","2759330"," Then you're going to wait for your next opportunity to take that short."
"2759530","2760470"," You'll do the same thing, right?"
"2760630","2761510"," You'll put your short on here. "
"2761510","2763470"," This is some tight stops above."
"2763830","2766210"," So you can at least enter one, two, three times."
"2766430","2771090"," If you want, if you want to take on that risk and don't care about what's going to happen, right?"
"2771950","2775290"," So these are your places, one, two, and three for the move lower. "
"2776050","2779990"," Now, even though we just rolled right here, right?"
"2780150","2782410"," We talked earlier, I want to give you one more thing."
"2782610","2782970"," Hold on here."
"2784590","2785490"," Let's close this up. "
"2788880","2790820"," Now, we have profit taking here, right?"
"2791280","2795280"," This is bulls like you and I, day traders know when to take profit."
"2795560","2796120"," This is disgusting."
"2796440","2797060"," We're terrible people. "
"2797820","2799780"," Day traders are some awful people, aren't we?"
"2802560","2807180"," Terrible, awful people taking profit, screwing long-term bulls out there."
"2810860","2812960"," So we take profit right here, right?"
"2813480","2819300"," We also discussed this level down here, this retest from the previous low yesterday down at 436."
"2821140","2822900"," So what am I looking for?"
"2823080","2823920"," I'm bullish on today. "
"2824000","2824600"," I'm not bearish."
"2824720","2825800"," I'm not taking a short here."
"2826200","2827140"," I think it's too risky. "
"2827660","2830160"," I think even if it does roll over here like this, right?"
"2830260","2831380"," I think this is just profit taking."
"2832020","2834720"," I think it's too risky today to take a short here."
"2835020","2843940"," So although, let me take a look. "
"2843940","2845700"," So there you go."
"2846600","2848780"," If you want to follow an HFP, right?"
"2850300","2853180"," 437 P, they're 74 cents currently."
"2855420","2858640"," So if you wanted to enter a short right now, if you missed this trade right here, you just want"
"2858640","2860560"," to grab it right here, right?"
"2860780","2863640"," Take this trade and commit to it for the rest of today. "
"2863980","2868100"," If you want, I think today is a really good day as well for a straddle."
"2868260","2870720"," You could straddle the OPEC for today and for tomorrow."
"2871660","2877280"," We're pretty much and guaranteed to get a pretty big swing today, like 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 6%"
"2877280","2878800"," move today, which pretty big. "
"2878920","2884220"," It's got a 1.5% move in the market today is going to print one side of a straddle."
"2884560","2889420"," If you just, if you, if you diamond-hand that shit for probably half the day, you're going to get"
"2889420","2892400"," an answer if we go higher or if we go lower."
"2893940","2895960"," You might not make 3, 4, 500%. "
"2895960","2900740"," You're going to make probably a close to 100% even after paying for the other leg of that straddle"
"2900740","2901900"," if you cut it loose at some point."
"2902520","2903880"," So we did talk about this down here."
"2904000","2908160"," So if I take another call, right, I'm looking for this move, right?"
"2908340","2911400"," I took this move with you, Dave live to trade that with you. "
"2911580","2916020"," I do want to see that retest so I can take that, that rocket ship hire here."
"2916380","2917440"," That's what I want to see."
"2918660","2924200"," That would be my preference is that we bounce back down here, do the retest, cut, knock that out,"
"2924360","2924460"," right?"
"2924920","2929920"," Let more bears get out of their shorts or their puts, I should say, and then get that rocket ship"
"2929920","2930120"," high. "
"2930320","2934520"," Get that those dealers fueling this rally higher, whether you're in the trade or not."
"2936420","2941940"," So we'll watch this right now and see if we come back down and we'll look to see if we"
"2941940","2944380"," find some support for another trade hire."
"2944380","2948320"," We're so evil. "
"2949120","2950780"," Day traders are terrible, right?"
"2951180","2952740"," This is why investors hate us."
"2954840","2959900"," Yeah, it is a retest of that trend line for the move hire, definitely."
"2964920","2966880"," I'm gambling my 445s. "
"2971200","2972580"," Let's take a look at TLT."
"2973720","2974660"," Who TLT?"
"2974760","2974900"," Nice."
"2975400","2976840"," I do like that bid in TLT. "
"2977480","2985380"," I am looking for, my daughter gave me a"
"2985380","2989700"," seat cushion that I'm not particularly happy with."
"2989800","2994000"," I think I have to buy a new office chair at that point."
"2995760","2999260"," I do like the idea of a bounce on TLT. "
"3000160","3006380"," I think I talked about, it's on a different charting software, a different Webull account on"
"3006380","3016000"," another computer, but I did like the idea of, I think this was, I think I showed this, I think"
"3016000","3021800"," we're at 130 in here the other day when I made this chart on another Webull account, right?"
"3022120","3030900"," We've been right about here and I had said, look for some capitulation, a downward capitulation"
"3030900","3031100"," move."
"3031360","3034760"," I think I put 126 in here and then 120."
"3035600","3036520"," I'll check it. "
"3038760","3041420"," I think I put the other one 120 down here."
"3043420","3046440"," Let's look back as to why I made that."
"3047640","3048680"," This is the reason. "
"3049700","3056380"," Just looking back on 2019, you can see this push hire rejection, right?"
"3056380","3057760"," Push hire rejection."
"3058540","3065880"," Then we finally came up and above and had this whole move here for 2020, 2019 and then into 2020,"
"3066120","3066200"," right?"
"3066400","3074400"," This 2021, they move up in 2020 and I just historically like this, the idea that there's support in"
"3074400","3074580"," here."
"3074980","3077320"," Now, do I think that TLT continue down lower?"
"3077500","3081080"," I do, but I think that this zone here, right?"
"3081240","3086500"," This area of support is going to take a lot of selling to get through. "
"3089400","3091140"," We're down here now."
"3091420","3098520"," We're down here, so there's going to be some support of, believe it or not, money down here, right?"
"3098660","3100780"," You can see where the banks pick this trade up, right?"
"3102980","3104920"," Some distribution over here, right?"
"3105980","3111880"," We know the banks pick trade somewhere in here and so right down in here, there's 120 levels"
"3111880","3112580"," slightly higher."
"3113020","3115020"," I think we're at 123.58 right now. "
"3115300","3120680"," I think even if you look back over here, whatever that level is, it's probably pretty close to, let"
"3120680","3121300"," me close that out."
"3124340","3134180"," Right in here, because that's 120.90. So regardless, we had a bounce down here,"
"3134360","3136620"," 122, this is pretty fucking close."
"3137240","3143160"," You could probably, if you have to pay attention to, go find out, I'm not sure if TLT has a"
"3143160","3148840"," dividend or not or if it closes to cash only, but just find out if there's a dividend when it's"
"3148840","3149100"," paid. "
"3149360","3155640"," If it's paid in the next quarter, what the date of the announcement to be expected, whatever"
"3155640","3162080"," expected it to be, and I don't think it's a bad idea to grab a call spread that's in the"
"3162080","3168200"," money that maybe pays 100% between now and maybe the week before that if there's an X dividend"
"3168200","3168640"," date."
"3169340","3169620"," It's fine."
"3169720","3170180"," I think we're close. "
"3170500","3177060"," Yeah, I think even if we trade, I think even if we trade lower, even if we swing down and"
"3177060","3182040"," swing up, even if we do this kind of a nonsense right here, I think you're going to still get"
"3182040","3186180"," some opportunities in here to print a call spread in here."
"3186880","3191560"," I think call spreads are warranted now to an extent where we are."
"3191760","3196100"," And I think the first time I even posted this was was was what this like a few weeks ago"
"3196100","3201300"," or two weeks ago or something, I was saying to you to look for a swoop down, move higher, some"
"3201300","3202640"," kind of recovery down in here. "
"3203020","3205700"," I posted on Twitter something with like two arrows on it."
"3206020","3207740"," It looks, it looks ready to some extent."
"3208140","3212900"," My only concern with this move right here is that the S&P 500 is rolling over right now. "
"3212900","3218660"," So I'm wondering if this coincides with a rollover of the S&P 500."
"3218880","3223740"," So I'm paying attention to TLT past week or two, I believe."
"3225380","3231620"," I've been I've been eyeballing it because the TLT bulls are getting fucking wrecked right now. "
"3231920","3233880"," There are a lot of calls on TLT right now."
"3234200","3237900"," I think we called this one out yesterday somewhere down here."
"3238560","3243700"," So we're at 122.81. We're already up a bucket or so close to a dollar. "
"3244240","3246620"," So we'll see if if we start to get that turn."
"3246840","3251380"," If we see any weakness, see this 121.95. Have you seen any weakness down here?"
"3253100","3256300"," You know, call spread down here somewhere down in this zone."
"3257040","3260300"," I think is a reasonable a reasonable idea. "
"3261220","3263640"," I think there's worse trades out there than that trade."
"3266200","3270980"," I'm not showing you what I'm doing over here, but like any kind of a trade down here, any kind"
"3270980","3273160"," of a buying opportunity down here close to that 120."
"3273720","3278120"," Even if it even if it goes down to 120 itself, you're going to see buyers. "
"3279660","3283020"," I think that's a pretty decent trade."
"3289950","3291230"," Small bounce on the spy."
"3291650","3292490"," Let's take a look on spy. "
"3292950","3293570"," Look a little bit lower."
"3295130","3298210"," Talked about the rechecking the lows."
"3298650","3303910"," The lows are at 436.71. Take a peek down here. "
"3305210","3307450"," Some support down here at 435."
"3311230","3312250"," I mean, we can get down to 435."
"3312410","3312990"," It would be nice. "
"3314090","3314370"," 433."
"3314890","3316510"," This is that same area in here, right?"
"3316870","3320570"," This is all that high traffic super buyer club down there."
"3326440","3327620"," I'm kind of supportive here. "
"3328300","3331180"," I always get you to get back in."
"3331240","3333120"," I'm like, man, I should have bought that, huh?"
"3333320","3333920"," I didn't."
"3334320","3335580"," Well, over here showing you guys. "
"3336640","3340600"," I should have bought that bounce."
"3344600","3347100"," So I'm still not in any trades any longer."
"3347340","3349000"," I'm just flat right now. "
"3349740","3359100"," Still known as 56,000, 57,000 puts on April 13th, 437 P for 65"
"3359100","3361820"," cents, 68 cents somewhere in there."
"3363040","3365440"," So the bears are betting that we roll over right here."
"3366580","3368220"," The bears are looking for lower numbers. "
"3376740","3377900"," I was kind of hanging out here."
"3378800","3380700"," I'm going to be looking for a bounce down."
"3380880","3386480"," I was still, I want to see that once I do please, please give me that touch of 436 again. "
"3387980","3389160"," So I can get cheap calls."
"3393780","3396560"," So the paid dividends on April 1st, that sucks."
"3397460","3398920"," Oh, no, that doesn't suck. "
"3399100","3399940"," Yeah, it should be every quarter."
"3400660","3404900"," So the next one should be for three months."
"3405400","3410920"," So you could probably buy some calls three months out that you are spreads, right?"
"3411360","3412400"," You can do them directionally. "
"3412500","3417300"," You could do credits if you wanted or buy them one month out, two months out."
"3419580","3422920"," And as they come into the money, you could harvest them."
"3429280","3433380"," Yeah, so Herms is asking me, do you ever do longer dated contracts?"
"3434560","3437700"," So we've discussed this past couple of weeks here. "
"3437780","3441700"," We'll discuss it this morning as Herms is asking that question."
"3442600","3447420"," So right now, we'll talk about the market regime right now."
"3447720","3450960"," So we'll look at something real quick. "
"3453180","3456440"," Let's look at the close all this out here and we clean this up."
"3457180","3457740"," Good question."
"3460220","3461560"," So we'll take a look back here. "
"3464800","3466600"," We're going to take a look back in time."
"3469770","3470970"," It's a very good question."
"3470970","3480270"," So we've got, this is September 2020, but we could go all the way back to March 2020. "
"3482070","3486550"," So what worked the past two years or so?"
"3491780","3492580"," It doesn't be perfect."
"3493180","3494720"," This is more of a case study."
"3495680","3505460"," So what worked the past two years, right?"
"3505460","3506920"," The market went up, right?"
"3507180","3508580"," It really didn't matter where you bought. "
"3508760","3509640"," You could buy a month out."
"3510720","3514540"," You buy three months out and you pretty much got a print, especially if you knew when to buy."
"3515280","3522480"," If you see this market breadth indicator, you get the best returns if you hit these, right?"
"3524320","3525820"," But you really didn't even need a breadth indicator. "
"3526120","3532280"," You just knew that pretty much the third week of the month, the OPEC state, you could buy a bottom"
"3532280","3533620"," and it would continue to go up."
"3535640","3536960"," And this worked out very well."
"3538600","3541780"," And the market was generally speaking, going up, right?"
"3543120","3546200"," So you had a consistent going up, right?"
"3548060","3550740"," Now, a couple things have changed since that time. "
"3550940","3554320"," A couple things started changing back in late 2021."
"3555120","3556060"," And there's two things."
"3556500","3558880"," The first thing is, let me close this up. "
"3563580","3565640"," A couple things that have taken place."
"3566920","3576240"," You used to be able to, you used to be able to, the first problem is that, let's say we"
"3576240","3577620"," were heading up, right?"
"3579700","3582300"," You used to have a call that was a month out, three months out."
"3583020","3587800"," And it would generally speaking, follow this move. "
"3588760","3590660"," Same thing works for the downward side, right?"
"3593000","3595360"," We were going down, you'd have that same kind of a thing."
"3596060","3600500"," It was like nice, smooth trading, right?"
"3601500","3604100"," Well, the environment that we're in right now doesn't really work with this."
"3604260","3609280"," What's happening right now is because of the trader's environment, you're not putting enough time"
"3609280","3612000"," on your longs or one to three month trades. "
"3612800","3615260"," And we're getting as these really nasty moves."
"3615600","3620620"," These are day traders, high-frequency trading firms, and they're just destroying any intrinsic"
"3620620","3622440"," value in calls by the time you get here."
"3622880","3627700"," You could have bought down here and then you find out that you're way down here and your time"
"3627700","3631540"," didn't actually pay you anything in those long calls. "
"3631780","3632460"," So this is what it's called."
"3633180","3637460"," We're in, first off, a highly volatile environment, right?"
"3637580","3638940"," We're not in a positive gamma environment."
"3639140","3641640"," You can see over here, we're not, right?"
"3642100","3645720"," You can see that we're not going up any longer, consistently, right?"
"3647060","3652300"," And because we're often in negative environments, we've got that violent moves going on. "
"3652980","3657420"," So can you place trades that are one to three months out safely?"
"3658000","3659580"," And the answer is yes and no."
"3660240","3666380"," The answer is that the real, the true answer is this is right now, don't be expecting."
"3666720","3670680"," As a macro view, just don't be expecting all-time highs. "
"3671400","3672400"," There it is right there."
"3672420","3673140"," Those are all-time highs."
"3673320","3673800"," Don't expect it. "
"3676300","3682420"," And the other thing to expect is that the market for time could be one month, could be six months"
"3682420","3683000"," or nine months."
"3683800","3685980"," For a time you're going to get lower lows, right?"
"3686840","3687820"," We get this line here."
"3689560","3693400"," And I don't think it's off the table to go down to 360 or 250, believe it or not. "
"3693520","3699560"," I don't, I don't think it's out of a question that we just trade sideways from here."
"3700980","3703980"," So you've got this defined range even right here."
"3706780","3707880"," Right here, right?"
"3708980","3712860"," Now the difference is back here you could have bought some calls and just fucking held them. "
"3713220","3716000"," And you come back and check on them and you get paid."
"3717840","3721740"," Now you can't do that here because of the regime that we're in."
"3722020","3728200"," So due to that, what you have to do is you have to find where the actual bottoms are and"
"3728200","3730640"," you can only hold for that time period. "
"3730920","3737940"," That would be like, you say, okay cap, I bought, we had a market liquidation event, right?"
"3738460","3745180"," So I bought some call spreads and I bought the, let's say, let's say here, let's say, let me get"
"3745180","3745520"," rid of this."
"3748080","3752060"," So let's say right here, you're like, okay cap, we had a liquidation event."
"3752500","3753620"," It's at 44383. "
"3753620","3761560"," So I bought some call spreads for four four or excuse me, four, four 52, right?"
"3761780","3765060"," Four 48s and four to four 52 call spreads, right?"
"3765580","3767140"," And they print a hundred percent cap."
"3767420","3771640"," So what you do here is you would take profit the moment that you realized it."
"3772900","3777820"," And until we have the next event, you're not going to enter any more trades and you're going to"
"3777820","3782140"," wait for the next one here and you're going to wait for the next one here and you're going to"
"3782140","3785980"," wait for the next one here and you're going to manage your trades, your investments, whether you're"
"3785980","3790800"," buying the queues, you're buying Apple or Tesla, whatever it is that you're buying, you're waiting"
"3790800","3796140"," for market moments of weakness to buy, right?"
"3796660","3800960"," Weakness by, weakness by, and you have to actively manage these trades now and you have to close"
"3800960","3801140"," them. "
"3801240","3804620"," You can't stay in them, you can't just buy fucking Apple and check on it in two years."
"3804780","3808580"," You just can't, you can't do it until this regime ends right here."
"3809580","3814400"," Okay, now you could buy some value stock in here. "
"3814820","3820580"," You could trade into value but the truth is that your value trade is more than likely going to,"
"3821100","3825260"," it's going to go up and down with the market moves, it's going to move with the market and it"
"3825260","3826760"," might be slightly up like this."
"3827560","3831740"," But you're not going to beat inflation, sorry, you're not, you're not the value trade, you're not"
"3831740","3832160"," going to beat it."
"3832520","3837660"," You're probably going to be left at the end of this where you don't have the money to buy the"
"3837660","3840700"," queues when we eventually do start heading up, right?"
"3840700","3843640"," Where you're higher in your, in your investments, right?"
"3844020","3847340"," So what you have to do to survive in this market right now to the regime that we're in my"
"3847340","3854980"," view and because the, the moves are even more violent in the queues, it produces even better money. "
"3854980","3861700"," So you follow the S&P 500 for market capitulation but then buy the queues at these dips, even if"
"3861700","3865940"," the queues roll fully over and you're just going to, you're going to make this money, make this"
"3865940","3868300"," money, make this money over the next six months through year."
"3868840","3873200"," And then when you're, when you're, when the market is, is done with this regime, you'll have"
"3873200","3877980"," profited enough so that when we start to get positive again in the market, that you're then ready"
"3877980","3882460"," to buy Apple or Tesla or whatever tech company is going to make that huge move higher."
"3882860","3886160"," And you know, you weren't stuck for a year in fucking value trade. "
"3886160","3890960"," So you went in, let's see, when you evaluate trade at with a hundred bucks and over the course of"
"3890960","3896000"," the next year or two, you're, you've got your, you've got your fingers up your butt and you maybe,"
"3896040","3898760"," maybe you made 120 or 200."
"3899540","3904960"," Meanwhile, the active investors and traders are actively making all this money."
"3905140","3906920"," So now they're stuck with 500 or 1000. "
"3907480","3911080"," So you've actually beaten that, beaten the process that's taking place in the market."
"3911620","3916160"," Now the key that the key I'm trying to state to you is, or the key about this description is"
"3916160","3922540"," that key about this description is that it was easy to make these trades with just a trend line."
"3922540","3924100"," You could snap a trend line. "
"3924560","3928440"," You knew that if you came down here and tested the 50, that you could take a trade here."
"3928780","3930440"," You can't just use that any longer."
"3930720","3935000"," So the point I'm trying to make is that if you use some kind of a breadth indicator, when we"
"3935000","3938620"," have large capitulation moments, you just have to manage a trade. "
"3938900","3942660"," The only difference that you're doing now is you're defining how long you're owning it."
"3942940","3948000"," You're not saying I bought Apple here, and I'm going to tell you something else, I should say this."
"3948860","3954560"," The reason you can't buy Apple at all of these dips and hold Apple is because there's a fair chance"
"3954560","3961340"," of tech, eventually rolling straight over on a major rollover, like down here. "
"3962900","3968360"," So if you get this major rollover and tech and you've been buying these dips and holding, you're"
"3968360","3970560"," going to be more fucked than if you just bought value."
"3970860","3976560"," So the regime right now for you as an investor is, I don't care what you buy, as long as"
"3976560","3982740"," they're participating in these market-wide sell-offs and the market-wide rips, make sure your stock"
"3982740","3983520"," is doing that."
"3984080","3992100"," Some stocks don't participate when we go up, and so my suggestion would be buy the queues or buy"
"3992100","3995560"," the S&P 500 on every market capitulation. "
"3996820","4004540"," Stack cash until the regime changes and we actually turn higher, and you can then buy Tesla here or"
"4004540","4004960"," here."
"4005200","4010540"," You can actually go back into Tesla specifically or Apple or whatever, and you would have had"
"4010540","4014320"," plenty of cash while tech rolls over."
"4015940","4022940"," So you can re-enter that trade, having made the same kind of Tesla or Apple money or Amazon money"
"4022940","4031420"," and not falling into the value trap and not been averaging down all the way to wherever Tesla winds"
"4031420","4032900"," up or Apple winds up or Amazon. "
"4033680","4034580"," So how do you do that?"
"4034740","4035480"," That's the question, right?"
"4035580","4041140"," The question is, hey Cap, the original question is, hey Cap, are you ever going to place those"
"4041140","4041420"," trades?"
"4042040","4050680"," So I've got a handle, it's called at Captain's trades, and I'm going to place anywhere from 10 to"
"4050680","4052140"," 12 of those trades with you a year."
"4052640","4061900"," So you figure you only get one of those two months, but it's usually roughly a month to a month"
"4061900","4062260"," and a half."
"4062380","4068440"," You'll see me give you one trade for the every month and a half or so it's called, yeah, it's"
"4068440","4074560"," called 10 trades in a year that you'll get from me for the rest of this year and probably into"
"4074560","4075320"," the beginning of next year. "
"4076640","4080120"," And I'll give you, I'll tell you, I'm going to do live stream with you so I can say to"
"4080120","4085900"," you, we can take this with some fair certainty about the next month or so we're going to trade"
"4085900","4086120"," higher."
"4086120","4089040"," Now, there are going to be moments where you miss a trade."
"4089220","4090780"," So matter of fact, this is a key point, right?"
"4091080","4095260"," The sucky part about these trading like this is that you're going to miss rips in the market. "
"4095420","4101359"," Like if you bought this down here, if you bought this, if I'd taken this trade right here, I may"
"4101359","4102779"," not have taken this trade over here."
"4102840","4107420"," You might have missed this right here because it didn't get full capitulation."
"4107779","4111420"," And you might say, hey, Cap, you missed this entire move higher, right?"
"4111680","4115560"," But the key is in the environment that we're in where we can roll the market over, we can trade"
"4115560","4117580"," sideways, we can have a market crash. "
"4117640","4122520"," There are all these risks in the market right now that you really, truly need, you really, truly"
"4122520","4124080"," need to be consistent."
"4124439","4130060"," I'm 100% of the time your money maker, your bread and butter, you have to have some rules in"
"4130060","4135700"," stone saying, if we meet these conditions, I'm going to take this trade all in or heavy in or 10 "
"4135700","4141779","% of my accountant, but whatever your risk profile is so that you can continue to make fat gains,"
"4142260","4150000"," fat huge gains and beat value stocks and beat the market rolling over and beat the event we think"
"4150000","4156060"," is an eventual correction, right, of at least the big indexes, a correction of tech."
"4157000","4161920"," You know, the funny part is it doesn't even matter in this regime if we're taking these trades, if"
"4161920","4166920"," we trade to all time highs, because we will have signals and the market will still capitulate all"
"4166920","4167439"," the way over there. "
"4167580","4172560"," So even in these moments, we were heading straight up, you still see market liquidation moments in"
"4172560","4172760"," here."
"4173060","4178600"," So the price doesn't matter and the direction doesn't matter, but matters is that we're safest"
"4178600","4182779"," right now in here buying these, these liquidation moments in the market."
"4183500","4186319"," So if you're wondering, hey, Cap, do you ever take these trades?"
"4186760","4190420"," Hey, Cap, I work a job seven, I work a job seven or five days a week, I'm in my"
"4190420","4193420"," office, I can't take these trades and actively manage the market. "
"4193900","4195480"," Yes, we do take those trades."
"4196280","4201080"," Furthermore, we can, what I'll do is you know, I'll add to this trade, I'll add a bear trade."
"4201340","4208620"," If you're a bear out there and you want, I'll, I'll place 10, 10 bear trades with you over the"
"4208620","4209440"," course of the year as well. "
"4209580","4209900"," How about that?"
"4210080","4215620"," So if we get a moment where I can guarantee that a bear trade is going to print, I'll place"
"4215620","4220720"," that trade live with you and we'll do both sides of the trade."
"4222900","4225340"," So you can, I think the bears are in a better position."
"4225800","4228060"," Then the bulls are right now, they don't need this trade. "
"4228920","4232840"," Because I think the most consistent trade of this is still on the bull side, usually as the market"
"4232840","4235220"," usually still goes up over time."
"4235880","4241460"," But what I'll do is I'll, I'll show you a consistent place where you meet certain expectations."
"4242220","4246280"," And as a matter of fact, if you're looking at this, if you're looking at this chart right here,"
"4246440","4251860"," just for today, this is this whole held true for yesterday as well, right?"
"4252160","4256160"," We didn't see yesterday the trade higher this 450, right?"
"4256220","4259820"," We saw that we remember we traded this up yesterday in this resistance point. "
"4260220","4262240"," And I said, I'm not taking this short here."
"4262340","4264160"," I want to buy it up here at 450."
"4264760","4266240"," This holds true for today. "
"4266900","4271800"," I don't want to take a short here until we break above to 445 and 450."
"4272180","4277220"," So if I find one of these trades that you can take in relative safety as a bear, I'm going"
"4277220","4282260"," to tell you exactly where it is that 445 and even better at 450 to take a short up in"
"4282260","4287020"," here, some kind of a put spread that you would hold let's say into March 18."
"4287420","4291020"," So if you're looking for your next safe put, right?"
"4291260","4292140"," Your next safe, right?"
"4292600","4296700"," One, these are the ones that keep me from not having to go and get a job, right?"
"4297000","4298420"," I don't have to work for a living. "
"4298860","4299800"," These are those trades."
"4300280","4303200"," You're looking for a trade, a short that's higher."
"4303480","4305780"," It's definitely here or here. "
"4306300","4306960"," It's not here."
"4307460","4308140"," It's not right here."
"4308280","4309460"," You promise you that it's not right here. "
"4310000","4316640"," I promise you that if you take these shorts right here, that you're going to probably win, I don't"
"4316640","4318280"," know, three to five of them out of 10."
"4318720","4324840"," I know that if I wait for trades like this in the regime that we're in, then I'm going to"
"4324840","4326260"," probably have a higher win rate."
"4326320","4331340"," I'm probably going to have eight, nine, maybe 10 wins every 10. "
"4331500","4336500"," I might miss one every 20, but it's going to be a much higher win rate, right?"
"4336720","4338880"," Your win rate over 10 over over 100 trades."
"4339360","4343260"," I would have I would have much much higher wins than anyone telling you."
"4343460","4347540"," Well, I'm taking short right here and I always take short right here because this is where we're"
"4347540","4347800"," at. "
"4347800","4348360"," It always works."
"4348700","4349480"," I don't think that it works."
"4350180","4353040"," There's other factors why it shouldn't work today right here. "
"4353840","4355820"," We've got some market conditions why it shouldn't work."
"4356240","4358380"," We've got OPEC's why it shouldn't work."
"4358560","4362000"," We've got this whole move that's come down why it shouldn't work. "
"4362120","4363400"," And I'm not saying we don't trade down from here."
"4363740","4369820"," I'm saying that the current conditions right now are showing that there's a lot of risk taking a"
"4369820","4372800"," short currently where we are today."
"4373000","4374080"," There's a lot of risk in here. "
"4374600","4380680"," And if you're looking at bears, bears are going to want better positioning, even if it's briefly up"
"4380680","4384000"," at 445, 450 to max gain the next leg down."
"4385100","4390840"," So anyways, with all that stuff said and and whatever, the point that I'm trying to make to you is"
"4392320","4399460"," yes, you can take trades with me that last I can't put time on how long they last right now"
"4399460","4401580"," because of how the market conditions are."
"4401880","4407400"," What we can do is you'll get a notification for me to get a text or not actually get a"
"4407400","4410460"," tweet that says you got to eat says we're close. "
"4411440","4412460"," We're almost there."
"4412720","4418580"," I'm going to show you what I'm thinking about buying and when I'll be live streaming that trade and"
"4418580","4419860"," then you'll be able to come watch me."
"4420200","4425840"," You'll I'll put the I'll put the brokerage up that I'm trading it on so you can see me live"
"4425840","4426320"," trade it. "
"4426740","4428520"," And then you can watch me manage the trade."
"4429400","4433660"," And I think we said it was a thousand bucks that we're we'll start trading with a thousand bucks."
"4433660","4437320"," Now for me, I said I was going to this for me. "
"4437380","4437840"," It's a challenge."
"4438140","4439720"," So I'm going to go 100% in every trade."
"4440440","4446260"," So whatever I make each trade, I'm going to go all in on 10 times to show you that just"
"4446260","4450660"," to show you that you can be a successful trader show you how to manage a trade. "
"4450660","4452900"," So they're winning trades, right?"
"4454460","4460320"," How to factor in a winning trade consistently, not not following me on gambling trades."
"4460320","4464760"," You guys follow, you guys watch me do zero dates all the time and piss away my my my gains."
"4465580","4469660"," But you I want to show you how to actually make consistent money so you can piss your money away"
"4469660","4470620"," gambling at the casino. "
"4471300","4477040"," Not have to worry about not to worry about blowing up your accounts and continuing to work your"
"4477040","4477660"," asses off."
"4477940","4483100"," Now if you've got money and you're not a new trader or yeah, you're an experienced trader, you can"
"4483100","4490000"," follow with whatever you want to normally I wouldn't trade make these trades with 100% of my"
"4490000","4490240"," accounts."
"4490540","4495280"," So if you're a new trader and this is your only thousand dollars, maybe you just trade with a"
"4495280","4495620"," hundred bucks. "
"4498330","4501810"," I wouldn't recommend that you blow up your accounts trading this with me."
"4502330","4506970"," I wouldn't I wouldn't even recommend that you trade this with let's say you do trade a thousand"
"4506970","4509890"," bucks on this trade and you make a thousand bucks for first trade."
"4510570","4515870"," My recommendation is that you probably just trade your next trade 10% of that that maybe you trade"
"4515870","4518170"," a hundred bucks or maybe you trade a thousand or something. "
"4519250","4522250"," But I'm going to do this with you to show you how to because a few things I want to"
"4522250","4524130"," show you because first of all we're Robin Hood sucks."
"4525050","4530210"," So I'm going to show you how to make money using that shit shit dump of of a of a"
"4530210","4530670"," brokerage."
"4531630","4536450"," Hopefully at some point I can get you out of Robin Hood into a better platform will trade on a"
"4536450","4542890"," different platform at some point so you can grow as a trader and also I want to teach you how"
"4542890","4544010"," to build an account. "
"4544290","4549230"," So if you don't have money I want to show you a consistent way to make make gains better than"
"4549230","4557310"," just buying stock and and not so not such a risky environment that a lot of you trade a lot"
"4557310","4559070"," of the risky trades you all place out there."
"4560950","4563050"," So I'm going to try to turn into a million bucks."
"4563250","4568910"," I think I can I think I'm a fairly I think I have a fairly good chance of it of"
"4568910","4572170"," it working but it's a lot of money. "
"4572410","4576210"," So if you guys don't have to stay in this trade with me all you know the entire time you"
"4576210","4576950"," guys can back out."
"4577230","4583530"," You got I don't expect you guys take you know half a million dollar trades call spread trades on"
"4583530","4589430"," the market with me but I'm going to do it because I've done it before I've done it probably three"
"4589430","4596150"," times I've done this trade where I went 100% 100% 100% and it prints it prints every"
"4596150","4596410"," time."
"4596770","4603650"," I still make these trades now but not not on that scale but this is how I make consistent money"
"4603650","4604130"," in the market. "
"4604130","4605590"," This is this is how I do it."
"4605970","4609110"," This is how I consistently make money in the market."
"4609530","4618210"," It's the only consistent trading plan that's worked for me over and over and over and I'll tell you"
"4618210","4623990"," what if you can make nine out of ten consistent trades and you burn one of them and you're not"
"4623990","4627870"," going in 100% every one of these trades you're going to consistently make money in the market. "
"4628150","4631490"," You're going to pay your taxes you're going to eventually be able to do whatever you want to do in"
"4631490","4631870"," your life."
"4632870","4638090"," Regardless if the market goes up regardless of the market burns to the ground regardless if we have"
"4638090","4647830"," another 2020 market crash regardless if the market rolls over like it huge rallies"
"4647830","4652170"," huge rallies when the market rolls over remember that."
"4653210","4657830"," Oftentimes you'll hear bears you know talk about the blood baths that take place in the market but"
"4657830","4667550"," I'll tell you what man the bounce trades are almost 100% guaranteed to print almost 100 "
"4667550","4675670","% that that oversold those oversold market conditions the banks are forced to buy them and that's"
"4675670","4680730"," similar to a vanarelli you've got someone on your side it's not you and your buddies saying oh do"
"4680730","4686310"," you think uh I don't know Palantare is going up today it's your you're actually trading with the"
"4686310","4690630"," banks the banks are buying the market you're following the banks they don't give a fine fuck about"
"4690630","4695470"," your half million dollars they don't give a fuck about your million dollars they're doing their own"
"4695470","4700810"," thing and you're just specked you like a little fly on their asses and you're they've got their big"
"4700810","4705810"," fat white man old white man hands right their greasy hands and you're just slipping your hand in"
"4705810","4710430"," their back pocket and you're skimming off some money for you so that you can make your way in this"
"4710430","4716590"," world and eventually when you learn this trade with me uh you're gonna probably stop a fucking I my"
"4716590","4722390"," thought I have a whole bunch of thoughts on this because my my thoughts are that if you I'm the"
"4722390","4725490"," all you experienced traders don't need me to tell you this should I know you guys already do this"
"4725490","4734430"," one way or another you do it with the condors and butterflies and you do it with um uh with"
"4734430","4738030"," selling calls if you have a nice fat bank you can just tell calls and buying the s&b 500"
"4738730","4744350"," that's a beautiful way self puts on buying the s&b 500 by spy you don't forget Tesla just buy"
"4744350","4749830"," a spy and sell calls and puts against it just make money that way but for a new trader new"
"4749830","4755790"," investor for someone that's not doesn't make consistent money uh even traders that uh maybe like"
"4755790","4761310"," three to five years they're trading journey and you're overthinking things I know that there was a"
"4761310","4767010"," time where like I got too smart as a trader I got I became too smart I knew I knew"
"4767010","4773130"," too much or I was paying attention to smart people on social media that were trying to use big"
"4773130","4780670"," words complicated uh structures and you know just fucking selling fucking uh newsletters and stupid"
"4780670","4789070"," shit and uh you know all kinds of fucking nonsense right and it has it has nothing to do nothing"
"4789070","4795310"," to do with making money in this fucking market because at the end of the day right in the fucking"
"4795310","4800630"," day all that horse shit that you see out there being peddled means nothing the only thing that"
"4800630","4807130"," matters is that you're you're getting a paycheck and uh that you're able to you know not work or be"
"4807130","4814090"," able to buy a car or a house or paint your college pay for your aunt's uh like operation or"
"4814090","4819690"," whatever it is that you whatever your your motivation and drive is no one going fucking cares like"
"4819690","4824590"," so when you're in twitter and you think some guy cares or wall street that's or I don't know stock"
"4824590","4833090"," twits or fucking somebody out there on the tick-tock or whatever um you know and the people that"
"4833090","4836850"," are selling you those programs and stuff like that they don't fucking care either they're trying to"
"4836850","4842910"," sell you an idea or because you're intelligent they're trying to make it sound better for you then"
"4842910","4846930"," you guys all come back and say why didn't it work cap why did we sell the news cap why"
"4846930","4852210"," did we do this cap so hopefully when this is done I hope that my hope my hope is that"
"4852210","4857510"," you realize that you could literally walk away from trading you could literally walk away from the"
"4857510","4862410"," day in day out of it the gambling side that you see guys like me do you see guy all"
"4862410","4867710"," you see you know men and women out there all time on youtube on twitter you could literally just"

"6164100","6169400"," call this gonna be a squeeze line if we if we if we break through these sellers up here uh"

"6274110","6280870"," what i think the problem is here is is that my thought process is that there's some retail bears"
"6280870","6287770"," that don't realize that there's dealers on hedging right now and that's the only thing working on"
"6287770","6292910"," your size of bull right now is that you've got dealers on hedging and these dealers that are on"
"6292910","6297770"," hedging right now are gonna ask blast any blip bears that are left in there that's my that's my"
"6297770","6304290"," take um i think is gonna happen here because we'll see if we trade higher every blast higher here"

"6591590","6597410"," you can probably still make your money back on a short position today if we start to break through"

"9388640","9394800"," and I told you to remember, I told you I said to remember, yeah I told you here. "
"9395340","9397400"," I said you know look for 210 a bounce."
"9397600","9403260"," We had nice support here yesterday and we got it to see if that trade was still on today."
"9403460","9404940"," So this is a decent trade for today. "
"9405620","9411000"," If you caught that bounce on and then the next level is 200 if the market sold off this morning."
"9411200","9412380"," It's like we had a decent bounce here."
"9413620","9414780"," On Facebook today. "
"9417380","9422180"," So I wonder if that guy is still in this trade and the point to in that trade is that"
"9422180","9426300"," guy is in that trade I think right up here somewhere."
"9429130","9432450"," That's we'll see if he's rolling or adding more money."
"9433130","9436110"," It looks like there's still some more to Facebook buyers out there. "
"9437310","9439410"," TSM as well has done well today."
"9439630","9446790"," TSM calls have been coming in I believe since 10 a.m. maybe 11 a.m. and they've just been"
"9446790","9448230"," monster all day long today."
"9449410","9454870"," I think we saw this trade come in this morning right here, right in this zone right here. "
"9456230","9462510"," Now they kept buying calls down in here after that initial pushup and that's been printing as well"
"9462950","9469550"," from 100 to 102.22. Still watching some more TSM calls come in April 29th."
"9470290","9478090"," 110 C could be part of a trade for the ER season."
"9479470","9485570"," If you want to see what the expectations would be on TSM we can take a look at that. "
"9488370","9490750"," This might be part of the rotation trade as well."
"9491250","9492410"," I do like this trade here."
"9492570","9494770"," I mean just looking at this chart here I like it. "
"9494770","9499090"," I always like seeing stuff like this right here."
"9499690","9503910"," I always like to see the distribution right the corrective phase of a stock."
"9506370","9509910"," At least at least in a short term corrective phase. "
"9510630","9513310"," And then I always like we always talk about here, right?"
"9513910","9517830"," You catch that bounce, right?"
"9518050","9520370"," You got a little resistance above here, right?"
"9520690","9522330"," Price target should be at least $107."
"9523590","9528850"," What you're looking for too in here is you know there are some trap buyers up in here, right?"
"9529050","9531730"," You know you got trap buyers up in here."
"9532150","9534810"," And so they're just waiting to get out of that trade. "
"9535010","9538950"," They've been stuck in it now for 10 days, 10 trading days."
"9540290","9542630"," Almost going back to January 29th."
"9542750","9552150"," So just be conscious of them wanting when they are exhausted is what you'd say, right?"
"9552350","9557190"," So we have this beautiful snap down here, right?"
"9557530","9560810"," Boom trade higher, great place to buy below in this consolidation area. "
"9561150","9565490"," Anything we can see anything below this at a buy, a buy, a third time a buy."
"9567860","9571900"," They took profit here, exhausted sellers, camp hired, exhausted sellers."
"9572520","9578300"," So your next area of concern without even looking at book map is gonna be, you get a little bit"
"9578300","9579800"," of bump right where we are right now. "
"9580240","9581960"," And you get another one right up here."
"9589330","9590770"," So you just trade zone, right?"
"9590870","9595710"," You take this higher, look for consolidation, wait for a breakthrough, consolidate, right?"
"9596110","9600950"," You just, all you're looking for is, if we break through, right?"
"9601110","9607350"," You take this here, consolidate, take this here, consolidate, and then look for some, for"
"9607350","9608330"," exhaustion of sellers."
"9608970","9613270"," And when you do something like this, you also sometimes have moments where we dip down below, makes"
"9613270","9614310"," for great buying opportunities. "
"9615090","9618490"," You never wanna buy in here, or sorry, look at this."
"9619290","9621510"," You never wanna buy whatever zone we're in."
"9622050","9626490"," You always wanna buy whatever we break below a zone, right?"
"9626770","9628070"," That would be the one you wanna buy. "
"9629570","9631550"," You always wanna buy that one right there."
"9632450","9638150"," Now I'm doing this on, like this is multiple days, but you can use this chart on intraday too, like"
"9638150","9639210"," daily trade."
"9640710","9643270"," You wanna be buying below whatever trading zone they're in. "
"9643490","9645390"," Now we're at the top of a trading zone right now."
"9645750","9651490"," You can pick this back up once we get above it, and then buy the dips, buy the dips, buy"
"9651490","9651750"," the dips."
"9652270","9653090"," And so it goes higher. "
"9653310","9655350"," I like this trade, I like the TSM trade."
"9716980","9721940"," I'm also gonna be looking for entry into another long here on the spy."
"9724100","9727420"," So I'm watching the VIX over here, it's got a quick bounce. "
"9727420","9732380"," If you watch the VIX, remember we talked about, before it happened, of course, we talked about the"
"9732380","9733500"," VIX coming into support."
"9733740","9739920"," It bounced right off 22.19. We'll look back at the VIX real quick."
"9743290","9745070"," We'll see that nice little bounce down here. "
"9746930","9748470"," Right, trying to recover itself over here."
"9757160","9760000"," Got that nice little bang, bang, move up higher."
"9760880","9762820"," We'll look to see if we can catch a dip in here. "
"9762820","9766400"," If you're a bull, you could be looking for somewhere in here."
"9767560","9770260"," It's B-A, right where we are, B."
"9771960","9774300"," And the safest one, of course, is gonna be C over here."
"9775580","9780540"," You could start out with like, if you started with a hundred bucks, you could buy $10 worth, then"
"9780540","9786420"," it added 30, and then it added 60 for a full trade in here for this move, like higher. "
"9794800","9795440"," We'll see."
"9796560","9797880"," I just added some calls here."
"9798460","9799640"," So I'll add calls here. "
"9799800","9805580"," I'll add calls down here again, and I'll add some more calls up here to see if we can make"
"9805580","9807160"," that next leg up."
"9822980","9826240"," So Brad, you got some DHEA?"
"9828060","9830700"," Yes, you got a Walmart version in the meantime."
"9830960","9833160"," How many milligrams Brad was in your Walmart version?"
"9852980","9853980"," Cost you 10 bucks. "
"9855340","9857540"," Dude, cost you 25 for the shipping, huh?"
"9857780","9857920"," Jesus."
"9872200","9873560"," You ordered DHEA markers."
"9875040","9877940"," You should have ordered the crayons with that redo roll off the table. "
"9880900","9882420"," Oh, it just got the 100 milligram ones."
"9882800","9884760"," Brad, what, Brad, what ones did you get from Walmart?"
"9885680","9888580"," Well, you did take two, whether they're the powder or a pill form."
"9889060","9890380"," I've heard that some of them aren't good. "
"9890520","9891980"," The ones that I got were off Amazon."
"9893320","9896400"," I think they're, I've got, actually, they sent me a one bottle by mistake."
"9896600","9898740"," They sent me one in a red bottle and one in a blue bottle. "
"9900500","9906460"," I'll grab them at some point and see, they end up sending me two."
"9906680","9909180"," So I take them in the morning."
"9911220","9915340"," Could you take them in the morning, Brad, or did you take them like nighttime or what?"
"9915500","9916080"," They don't do a lot. "
"9916380","9925660"," That was my point behind the, I bought the 100 milligrams, but I take them in the morning when I"
"9925660","9926320"," first wake up."
"9929440","9934760"," They shouldn't be like, they shouldn't feel like you took like rippets, not rippets, those are"
"9934760","9939460"," drinks, but, you know, the, I figure what they're called now, but it's not like you're taking"
"9939460","9940560"," caffeine pills or anything."
"9941080","9942740"," They should help with mind clarity. "
"9943140","9944140"," The mind should feel clear."
"9944320","9947200"," You should feel energy and you should make your dick hard."
"9949220","9951160"," You should probably go and try to rub one out, Brad. "
"9951860","9954180"," Get off the internet for like 10 minutes and try to rub one out."
"9955580","9961140"," I don't know if it needs to be in eyes."
"9961340","9962080"," I'm taking it in the morning. "
"9962560","9964660"," I wake up in the morning, I'll pop pill with us some water."
"9965080","9969660"," I'll take some vitamins and just like usual one-a-day vitamins, that kind of stuff."
"9973620","9979800"," What I noticed is that I have like manageable energy, not like from a caffeine pill, like it gives"
"9979800","9980460"," me more energy. "
"9982320","9990280"," I noticed that my sex drive is up and then I noticed that my mind is clearer."
"9992820","9997560"," I get more focused, almost like Adderall without the Adderall."
"10002770","10005470"," Yeah, I'll go grab the bottles right now and take a look. "
"10005670","10005830"," Hold on."
"10006190","10006770"," Give me two seconds."
"10007150","10007630"," I'll get the bottles. "
"10123750","10125070"," Get the headphones on."
"10131790","10133070"," We'll see what happens here."
"10133550","10139660"," I'm looking at this just creepy crawly down. "
"10140240","10142900"," This is where those original sellers were at, 44083."
"10143820","10152790"," It looks like there's some support at 440, 40 down here, slightly down, like here, right in this"
"10152790","10153130"," zone."
"10154850","10156730"," I did buy some calls right in here. "
"10157770","10159970"," Like five minutes ago, I bought some in here, I'm still holding them."
"10161210","10162370"," Just, I don't want to miss that."
"10162870","10164430"," You know how these days go, right?"
"10164910","10166410"," You consolidate, you're not missing the rip. "
"10167690","10169350"," Consolidate in here and think it's going to roll over."
"10169530","10178390"," It might roll over, but typically in days like today, at least twice now so far, you're not missing"
"10178390","10179190"," these trades, right?"
"10180070","10181850"," Consolidate, so you think it's going to roll, it doesn't."
"10182450","10186290"," It goes up here and then you say, shit, next time it happens, I'll do it. "
"10186550","10187730"," And then it gives this stupid shit."
"10188470","10190030"," And you get scared and then it does this."
"10190330","10193650"," Then by the time it's happened three times, you missed the entire fucking trade all the way up. "
"10196160","10197660"," So I've taken this trade now."
"10197860","10201060"," I took this one here and I took this one right here."
"10201420","10202740"," I know I took, I only took this one. "
"10202740","10205500"," I'm sure reporting year to day consumer prices of 10."
"10205620","10206620"," I only took that part of it right here."
"10206720","10209360"," The percent for the week is weekly CPI data from Russia. "
"10211040","10215740"," So I'm going to, I'm going to just pass the new hour here in New York, the doubt about 130"
"10215740","10216320"," points."
"10216460","10219060"," The S&P at 44, 23 up to 25 handles."
"10221340","10223500"," So the positive one, 97. "
"10225220","10230260"," First one is Horbosch, H-O-R-B-A-A-C-H, Horbok."
"10232020","10232740"," 100 milligrams."
"10233300","10234540"," I'll hold the bottle up for you. "
"10235340","10237320"," These ones right here have been very hyped out."
"10237500","10239100"," These ones I didn't feel as much this morning."
"10239300","10240040"," I took these this morning. "
"10240420","10241100"," They were okay."
"10242000","10245240"," This one right here is the one in the red bottle."
"10245600","10246380"," Oh it's still Horbok. "
"10247560","10248440"," So I don't know."
"10248560","10248980"," Oh wait a minute."
"10249140","10249400"," That's why. "
"10249620","10250000"," No wait a minute."
"10250840","10254180"," It says they're the same same company."
"10255680","10265040"," This one this one is red though with a blue and white label and they've worked well for me. "
"10267260","10277020"," They don't give you the feeling of like you took a sit-up valve but they they increase your sex"
"10277020","10277300"," drive."
"10279060","10280520"," It's like you feel motivated like you want to get laid."
"10287130","10289170"," So basically if we get a little little roll over down here. "
"10296510","10298790"," This is that little area down here I was talking about."
"10298930","10310150"," You can see you've got this little band right here and you've got VWAP backed out at 439.71. You"
"10310150","10311190"," can see the support here."
"10311970","10314290"," And of course the smart money is down below it. "
"10314370","10319050"," 439.40 to catch a dip down this area right here."
"10330860","10332860"," Now I just want to rehash too."
"10334980","10341540"," And the rehash is still that because we're in that positive area you've got you know an ABC trade. "
"10341560","10343000"," Same it when you're bearish."
"10343240","10343660"," Same idea."
"10344560","10348220"," You can just reverse this if we were the other way around A, B and C."
"10349040","10356840"," The safest trade is of course the C trade because you're B trade. "
"10357740","10359780"," Now the A trade is the riskiest trade."
"10359960","10365060"," So you typically enter with a small amount of money and then add to it twice right."
"10366020","10369520"," But if you don't take the A trade you could miss the trade. "
"10369620","10374920"," So you end up going higher you didn't get a chance to buy B and C."
"10375240","10377740"," So even if you're only going to take a little bit of this trade."
"10378120","10383080"," Let's say if you're doing 100 bucks you'd take $10 here $30 here and then $60 here once the"
"10383080","10384080"," confirmation is in."
"10384580","10386800"," People always ask which part which one do you take. "
"10387360","10388180"," If you're bullish."
"10390160","10393500"," I'll start with a small amount add more and add more right."
"10393880","10399000"," If I'm neutral I might only take the B trade then the C trade and if we're kind of bearish"
"10399000","10403060"," right if we were bearish right I'm not seeing us as bearish right now I would take only the C"
"10403060","10403640"," trade right. "
"10404480","10407380"," Only if there's confirmation for that next move higher."
"10428630","10429930"," Yeah so those are the pills I'm taking."
"10430050","10430630"," I'm pretty happy with it. "
"10430690","10432090"," I usually am not happy with supplements."
"10433030","10439910"," I don't like kinds of like I feel like the one a day but multivitamin and then I've bought"
"10439910","10441270"," different vitamins over the years."
"10441450","10441930"," I'm never happy. "
"10442230","10447110"," Sometimes the two there's too much of an effect like some of these things like get me too amped up"
"10447110","10450450"," or I get edgy or I get it's like affecting me too much."
"10450450","10453470"," It's just it doesn't feel natural in any way shape or form."
"10455250","10459630"," And so I'm always trying to I want to feel normal but feel better. "
"10459710","10461770"," I feel like I'm you know younger of course."
"10462130","10464090"," Anytime you're over your 30s and your 40s."
"10466230","10468030"," You know you want that just that little bit of edge. "
"10468650","10473050"," That same feeling that you have when you're 16, 20, 25 and these have been helping with that."
"10473630","10476370"," It's got a nice little squeeze going on in the spy."
"10476570","10477670"," Currently just squeezing them out. "
"10477910","10478390"," Squeezing them out."
"10480130","10481090"," See if this continues on."
"10502110","10506260"," You take a look at it. "
"10506660","10508820"," Check out where I'm looking through right now."
"10510600","10511620"," Let's see what you guys are saying."
"10513960","10516180"," Hold on at least scroll back up here missing some of your stuff. "
"10516460","10520400"," I used to have high blood pressure now 125 or 83 years old at a month."
"10524670","10526190"," Miss once of you guys are saying above here."
"10528270","10530270"," Yeah I'm not on any other I'm not on any medications. "
"10531890","10533650"," Yeah Adderall minus the math of course."
"10535370","10540950"," My blood pressure has come down to you know it's you know at this year specifically this winter."
"10541610","10547490"," I have an exercise is the first one first time of the year they have an exercise regularly was this"
"10547490","10547790"," winter. "
"10549150","10550030"," I'm kind of scared."
"10550030","10557090"," My last checkup was excellent but I haven't done my my normal regime of exercising since this past"
"10557090","10558470"," winter has been really fucked up for me."
"10558930","10560770"," Just too too busy too much trick going on. "
"10563150","10565170"," You fast every two months for seven days."
"10565870","10567050"," I used to fast a lot too."
"10567170","10567850"," I love fasting. "
"10568350","10571170"," I fucking love fasting or not fasting."
"10571390","10573010"," I like to skip a day of eating."
"10573570","10574590"," I used to do it more religiously. "
"10574930","10575430"," I don't do it as much."
"10575610","10576310"," I used to wish I did."
"10576610","10577030"," I feel great. "
"10577650","10578990"," Even just skipping a day of eating."
"10589060","10590560"," Take two of these pills and rub them out."
"10590760","10591200"," You'll be fine. "

"12346620","12356560"," from here to here the dealers and market makers are destroying the value right eventually most"

"12857900","12865360"," use this one right here we can spread it out a little bit like that the part of the trade"
"12865360","12871000"," if you especially if you're busy it's hard to it's hard to take this rotation part of the trade"
"12871000","12875420"," like you'll probably hear people saying well this is going up or that's going up this part of the"
"12875420","12881480"," trade is difficult it's always like these trades that are easier these trades are easier here"
"12881480","12890120"," whether it's a weekly or monthly there's like one there there's another one right here if you ever"
"12890120","12895720"," if you're looking for you know place a trade same goes for for bears too that don't have a lot"
"12895720","12901220"," of time whenever you see moves like this you can usually get a nice short on whether it's a put"
"12901220","12908960"," spread is another one right here and on a larger time frame you can see going back you have some"
"12908960","12912600"," little more wiggle room the only thing I would say if you don't have time to pay attention was to"
"12912600","12920560"," start to learn how to place debit spreads or credit spreads either bull or bear so you have to deal"
"12920560","12926020"," with the intraday shenanigans that take place so on a like a longer weekly time frame you can"
"12926020","12932300"," probably trade all these in here you can trade these two you can you can trade these these are"
"12932300","12937580"," harder though the easier one out of all these trades of course is like the capitulation moments"
"12937580","12943060"," right when you see these capitulation moments you can usually take a spread with some confidence in"
"12943060","12951920"," there and we're getting close so I'm checking these trades if you look right in this area here this"
"12951920","12959680"," 52 54% over here 596 right these numbers 46 over here totals 46 this is starting to get bearish"
"12959680","12964600"," overall so my viewpoint right now is still bearish so if you're just if you don't you can't day"
"12964600","12973000"," trade or whatever even if we rotate still I'm looking at some point for a rollover in the market so"
"12973000","12982240"," if you're looking for that rollover in the market we change this to a three month now you're just"
"12982240","12987900"," looking for better positioning you saw the positioning here you know the market is rolling over"
"12987900","12996880"," slowly it's happening slowly but it's rolling over you know you could take you could take some put"
"12996880","13002760"," spreads out your target is hopefully you can get up here this 4 4 6 9 if you can get"
"13002760","13011740"," up here in this area anywhere up in here you can probably take a put spread that's in the market"
"13011740","13015860"," just watch it and it's not going to matter in a put spread if we try to put a link"
"13015860","13020700"," that I'm going to do some little purchases from just trying to capture the energy firm or I'm not"

"13063540","13069360"," it's pretty good chances for the stock market rate 70% chance that if you were to buy a put"
"13069360","13077600"," spread anywhere from 445 to 450 date it for May 18th it'll print easiest pie"

"13116720","13131020"," is up here the bears right they'll buy"
"13131020","13138840"," some puts let's say it's a bank or something go buy some puts and we'll start going down right and"
"13138840","13148800"," as we get down here some retail bears will buy again they didn't they missed this whole run so"
"13148800","13157180"," they'll load up again and I'll put them on weeklies and instead the market will go up and I'll"
"13157180","13160900"," explain more detail why we go up when they buy these puts that I basically these are the bag"
"13160900","13166840"," holders for these bears up here now meanwhile they'll hope and pray that this is what they bought"
"13166840","13175240"," the puts let's say they bought four third or four tens right they bought the four tens here we come"
"13175240","13178160"," back up and they're hoping and pray and they're gonna come up with those weeklies expire but they"
"13178160","13184180"," don't we just straight sideways and they expire worthless then the week after we actually make the"
"13184180","13193440"," dump lower and that's the point right this is almost the point that I'm talking about him and"
"13193440","13197900"," you'll always see that right down here you buy in the four four hundreds or let's say three"
"13197900","13202900"," nineties and they would ever print I mean this is other factors do we continue to add later down"
"13202900","13207120"," the line that kind of stuff we have to look for that every day right and information we need to"
"13207120","13216900"," know if if they're rolling or adding to their positions so as we're down here the smart bears"
"13216900","13223940"," taking their profit taking their profit taking their profit and they're just waiting for the next"
"13223940","13229900"," time for them to get more bearish here now the question becomes bulls will sell you well we're no"
"13229900","13235440"," we're gonna go back up here and retest four sixty five is there any reason for us to test up"
"13235440","13240760"," here right now no we know that right can we go up here sure we'll trade every level as we"
"13240760","13245900"," go higher now that if you're bearish on the market and if you're a bank if you're a high-pricket"

"13255460","13262640"," they're looking for better positioning so it's somewhere in this vicinity so if you're a bear just"
"13262640","13271040"," be looking to get short again up in this zone the safe way to do it is put spreads you"
"13271040","13278120"," can even go higher that four sixty five and then sell down into the May 18th OpEx and still collect"
"13278120","13284140"," your money on those spreads right if you have the time to monitor or trade intraday or weeklies you"

"13372140","13379560"," was in April over here so let's call it like into next week and then we get that big bounce"
"13379560","13389180"," up to the end of April over here and then we actually trade down deeper something like that"
"13389180","13395920"," I think we get that roll I think we get that nice trade higher and then we actually get that"
"13395920","13402300"," we get that moved out into and to OPEC for 400 I think like May 18th or possibly a week"
"13402300","13408560"," or two later you'll see 400 like in the grander scheme of things now some of your barriers looking"

"13425600","13431340"," and we're getting a van a rally from right now get if you're a bull you're not seeing massive calls"
"13431340","13441160"," coming to the market you're seeing the rally because the dealers don't have to don't have to hedge"
"13441160","13447820"," those puts any longer now normally you get this this field rally will would be screaming higher"
"13447820","13453100"," right now if we had call buying out into April we sort of seen it today we're not seeing it"

"13647250","13655590"," of runway in here look look for some sideways movements consolidation need more oomph to get up"
"13655590","13661530"," here and I would still expect to move higher into the bell here at some point some squeezing as"

"13730840","13739950"," could screen maybe I you know what it could do is possibly I could set up like a second screener"
"13739950","13746410"," with a candlestick chart in discord have like I could have the options flow in that discord and"
"13746410","13752010"," maybe a candlestick chart in in discord if that would help that way you could screen the options"
"13752010","13760150"," flow and screen that the candlesticks I don't know if that would help"
"13760150","13768480"," yeah maybe it wasn't you Dan someone was asked"
"13768480","13775860"," about it if I can put maybe I can post let me try to figure that out but I think"
"13775860","13782420"," about how to get a second screener up or like do like a dual stream or something now we could"

"13806090","13813230"," but I could I could make another username or something and screen stream the candlesticks in"
"13813230","13818930"," discord I think and then what you guys could do is have like two or three screener's up so you"
"13818930","13828840"," can constantly monitor both the small screen works also let me see if"
"13828840","13838540"," there's a try to think of a way to let's try to get results"
"13838540","13843860"," in the treasures 20 billion dollar 30 year bond reopening hold on a second here they can usually do"
"13843860","13852100"," is I might be able to do a screen like a screen a display capture"
