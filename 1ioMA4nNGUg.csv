"2880","3840"," Good morning traders."
"5400","7620"," Captain Jim James here with a special daily brief."
"8520","10840"," I did post your normal daily brief on Twitter this morning. "
"11480","17680"," Sometimes you can feel lost picking the right stocks and earning a season to follow or to invest"
"17680","18120"," in."
"18460","20500"," You seem like you always miss the runners."
"21060","26600"," I'm going to give you some ideas this morning on where to look for the rest of the earnings season. "
"27840","32720"," Before we get into that, I just want to show you historical investment exposure of the market"
"32720","33740"," against Spy."
"34740","37760"," These are where the banks are long in the market."
"38560","41260"," It shows a bullish percentage rate. "
"41380","43540"," You can see 72, 68, 69."
"44460","49580"," You'll see we're starting to de-risk off the market here or down all the way to 58% bullish."
"51460","56700"," Now we can go as low as the low 50s, low 40s and the market will still go up. "
"57800","61480"," But as far as sell the market type situation, you are getting close."
"63480","68640"," I'll keep you up to date with this over time as we head into August and September."
"69980","76580"," But as we continue to climb, the risk exposure will become higher to a major risk off event. "
"78540","80000"," Do I think it's happened this week?"
"80280","80700"," Probably not."
"80800","84060"," Probably won't happen until the banks get there."
"84540","88860"," They need to and want to get their fills before they de-risk. "
"89840","95620"," Let's just take a look real quick at category exposure in the market and fine tune it to"
"95620","96720"," subcategory exposure."
"97500","99880"," This is really where the meat and potatoes is right here."
"101120","107140"," If you take a look at, let's say, aluminum here, banks are long in aluminum. "
"107960","110240"," That brings to mind Alcoa, right?"
"110600","116280"," I always look for stocks that I can trade shares or options on that are also retail friendly."
"116620","121360"," So in these run-ups, not only do you get the banks involved, but you also get that retail FOMO"
"121360","122260"," leading up to ER."
"123820","127699"," So you can sell it before ER, the ER data if you want to. "
"129000","131720"," So I would do a little search for aluminum stocks."
"133300","140680"," Another one to look at would be paper products, although I'm a little concerned with paper"
"140680","146100"," packaging not realizing its profit at this point."
"146620","153600"," So I look up paper products and then some others would include auto and truck manufacturers"
"153600","156900"," advertising and marketing. "
"157400","166680"," I like auto and truck manufacturers when in reality they are."
"166740","168900"," They are long tesla, they're long cord, Chevy."
"170100","174800"," So be aware of what they're telling you and what they're actually doing in the background. "
"177140","179560"," Some others they want to look at would be footwear."
"180160","187180"," We already know about Nike, but that should also track into other footwear makers as they will"
"187180","190220"," follow Nike's suit with direct consumer selling."
"196720","198540"," Then a shocker you wouldn't think that they're long. "
"198740","201300"," Those cruise lines and airlines, but they actually are."
"201600","202460"," Another one would be restaurants."
"204380","214160"," Then also look at retail home furnishings, specialty finance, diversified REITs and"
"214160","219480"," residential REITs, managed health care, employment services. "
"219780","220320"," I like this one."
"220600","225780"," This has a lot of retail friendly stocks, excuse me, stocks that you can play options on."
"225960","228880"," We'll talk about employment services here in just a moment. "
"229800","230520"," And office equipment."
"230880","233240"," I like the idea of office equipment into ER season."
"233480","234300"," We've done office depot. "
"235240","235980"," It's a great one."
"236180","236340"," ODP."
"237580","238120"," ODP. "
"239700","241800"," Then down here you've got marine utilities."
"242520","246660"," Excuse me, we've got multi-line natural gas and water utilities."
"247800","250700"," More than likely these are low-liquid stocks that we're playing. "
"251640","253780"," You can also play ETFs in these categories."
"255019","260740"," You can play XLU, which has been very bullish past, I want to say at least maybe one to three"
"260740","260959"," weeks."
"262200","266960"," So you can always pause this, come back and check these sub-categories and start to search for"
"266960","271200"," stocks within to start charting out for yourself, looking for bullish patterns. "
"272080","276260"," I did one over here for office equipment stocks."
"277940","285900"," And right up top on Google, you'll see some of the most well-known ones like Avery, OfficeMax."
"286780","292020"," Start charting these companies out and wait for a chance to buy a different one of these companies. "
"293420","294660"," Same would go for aluminum."
"295480","296360"," Alco is well-known."
"297500","303800"," Some of these other stocks are under 10 bucks. "
"303980","305760"," You can play these by buying shares."
"307240","307900"," Natural gas."
"309140","314700"," On Twitter, I posted about capital oil and we played them, I want to say two or three weeks ago. "
"316020","317100"," Made some great money."
"317500","321680"," And then you've got Exxon, mobile and Chevron, both having ER dates this week."
"322520","323340"," So here are two right away. "
"323520","326400"," You can look into charting out and playing pre- or post-ER."
"326760","328460"," Here are employment service stocks."
"329780","333660"," I always stick with the ones that I know like ADP, Cali Services, paychecks. "
"334360","339340"," You know the banks are behind these, behind these employment services companies, or companies."
"340180","345260"," Even if we have a down day one day in these stocks fall, they're going to hold these unless we"
"345260","346200"," have a market sell-off."
"347100","349960"," So these are three to watch in the coming weeks. "
"349960","354900"," I want to say some of these are probably how their ERs in August or in early September."
"356880","358680"," There's another one here, restaurant stocks."
"359200","363160"," You know, water stocks where we talked about, where we talked about water utilities. "
"363500","367980"," Probably we'd trade many of these, but the XLU ETF is one to watch."
"368920","374640"," Now just after doing these Google searches, BP, this is a year chart on ODP."
"374980","379440"," You can see this nice big fat bull flag and that a nice spring up up here. "
"380680","383460"," And then you also see that they came back down."
"384140","389880"," The support was defended, support was defended, support was defended, defended, defended, defended."
"390840","392260"," Another bull flag forming right here. "
"393540","398100"," You can see here on July 19th when we had a down day in the market, or I think it"
"398100","402400"," was the 18th or 17th through the 19th or some that weekend Friday Monday."
"403000","405800"," Monday morning, this thing bounced right back and printed heavy."
"406620","413440"," So maybe you set a biler down here at 42.70 and get ready to buy yourself some options or"
"413440","415940"," even just buy that stock outright heading into their ER day. "
"417640","423460"," So I hope this helped you find stocks for earning the season to give you some kind of an idea"
"423460","426060"," of where you should be searching for the banks being long."
"426980","428820"," Otherwise have yourself a great day trading. "
