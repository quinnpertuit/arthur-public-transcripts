"27910","28690"," Good morning."
"37100","38440"," Good morning, everybody."
"45820","60140"," So that by the dippers are showing up this morning on Facebook, I have"
"60140","65760"," lots of by the dippers this morning on Facebook, spending millions and millions on Facebook, which"
"65760","70280"," is a good sign, though I don't know how much it matters. "
"71980","73020"," Good morning, everybody."
"88560","90000"," Give me just a moment here."
"98160","100700"," So there are millions of dollars coming in this morning on Facebook. "
"102040","104620"," For February 11, 240 C."
"106500","106980"," Millions."
"108440","109740"," Let's see if I can even count it up."
"116590","123250"," It's $11.4 million in Amazon or an excuse in Facebook calls and they're by the million dollar load. "
"124110","133230"," Facebook has the same thing this morning, $7.1 million in calls and video has eight eight orders"
"133230","134610"," for $1.4 million."
"136770","140550"," Now there's a reason for this and that's because of where we are in the charts right now."
"141110","144290"," On this level of 450, we cannot break 450. "
"146190","154550"," It is interesting that these are calls are coming in because they're not coming in from, I would"
"154550","155470"," say, regular traders."
"157090","164710"," This is the last ditch effort to hold on to the markets through Facebook specifically."
"168800","170740"," You got Bill Ackman type move. "
"171940","180650"," I want you to just be aware of that here this morning because if we do break for January expected,"
"181150","187550"," 59.5 power 62.3. Let's get December factory orders expected minus 0.4 percent."
"188190","191030"," X transportation scene plus 0.4 percent."
"192510","197870"," The factory orders will get the December final, durable goods orders data expected minus 0.9"
"197870","198210"," percent. "
"200650","203910"," Now the reason I'm bringing this up to you this morning is because if we do break through this"
"203910","206610"," level this morning, it leads to worse things."
"207490","216610"," It will open the door to not only 430 almost immediately, but it opens the door down into the"
"216610","217610"," market very low."
"224450","227230"," It would make a move down faster. "
"228670","232230"," Now if we don't break 450, it doesn't lead us down to those lows."
"233290","236150"," I need you to know that this morning, whether you do or don't know that."
"237150","239650"," That there's an attempt to save the market this morning. "
"241850","244010"," Not necessarily make it go to all time highs."
"251800","265060"," It's more a function of how"
"265060","267020"," deep does the sell-off happen."
"269300","272300"," At some point I'm going to put a chart up for you. "
"273340","278680"," It's 1 plus 1 leads to 2 plus 1 leads to 3."
"281580","289900"," You can't get to three without a few things being met, right?"
"290400","300280"," But if you break 450, let's say today, it opens a swift move down in how fast or how"
"300280","308660"," deep we go."
"308660","311320"," Let's say the deepest 440 in a day or two."
"311700","318600"," We would actually rebound head higher into the 460s, 470s, maybe for another, and then maybe"
"318600","320060"," another move down, not as deep. "
"321020","328800"," We could trade down to possibly, if we bounce off 450, we could trade higher to 460 than maybe down"
"328800","331160"," to 440 and then back up again."
"331660","338080"," But if we break 450 today, it opens the door to 430 swiftly and then actually a deeper move down."
"338320","340820"," It would make it like a one, two, three count, one, two, three count. "
"341340","346560"," That third count, that second set of a third count will lead us down to very low."
"346980","349040"," That's the oh shit moment."
"352020","353180"," That's lower than a 420. "
"354620","356900"," They want to say it's 415 or lower."
"357320","361840"," Some people have that count as low as 360 to 390, believe it or not."
"362180","362840"," Now I don't. "
"363300","366620"," Be personally, you have to give a lot of work to get there."
"366920","367900"," I want you to know this one."
"368120","370420"," That's the reason why there are so many calls on Facebook. "
"371380","373800"," There's an attempt to save the market currently."
"373800","383720"," The crazy part is if Amazon holders panic, if bulls"
"383720","391760"," panic, if they're too afraid of the Amazon earnings later today, it's not going to matter."
"406740","408920"," It's not going to matter at that point. "
"409140","414080"," If you get any kind of bull panic, we talk about how retail is not a force, but they can"
"414080","416320"," be a force if they're all thinking the same way."
"416880","419520"," So that is one thing to have in mind."
"419520","423580"," The one the one impact that retail does have is that we all trade the same stuff. "
"423600","428480"," So if every retail person says, well, you know, we're all getting out of Amazon today."
"429920","430700"," That's not good."
"430780","435960"," You can you can actually be a force in the market against banks or hedge funds. "
"440320","441060"," So that is"
"441060","451780"," a"
"451780","451780"," concern."
"453060","453920"," Lower than expected."
"454700","458260"," Double goods orders of minus 0.7% is two tenths higher than expected. "
"458700","462580"," X transportation 0.6% is up to tens from the preliminary."
"463080","468500"," Capital goods orders of 0.3% is up three tenths from preliminary and capital good shipments of 1.3 "
"468500","469460","% in line with prelim."
"471140","480130"," And some data employment index slipping to 52.3 from 54.7. Prices. "
"480770","482830"," 10% is going to be finished."
"483130","489570"," 3.9. No, probably not manufacturing PMI."
"489710","491310"," That's lowest since February 2021. "
"494530","497990"," The order is lowest since February 2021 as well."
"513460","518760"," Check central banker Russ Knox saying more large check rate hikes may not be needed following the"
"518760","520500"," decision to raise rates earlier today."
"523590","528530"," Spanish press reporting that Prime Minister Sanchez of Spain has secured the votes to pass labor"
"528530","529190"," reforms. "
"534300","536900"," Now, there are lots of call buyers stepping in across the market."
"536900","537920"," I want you to be aware of that."
"538340","543820"," There are implications of other countries emerging markets that are raising their rates, whereas"
"543820","545680"," before they weren't going to. "
"548780","551720"," We'll talk about that later this afternoon as well, the implications of that."
"553600","559940"," Versus the or inflation being lowered though the dollar increasing in value with foreign goods"
"559940","560640"," being cheaper."
"563840","567860"," But currently right now you should see the market hold on the rest of today. "
"568100","570180"," You should not see the market fall today."
"571120","576640"," That does not mean it goes up, but it does mean it waits the Amazon the Amazon ER."
"578460","580560"," And the importance of the Amazon ER. "
"587340","590220"," If we break through 450 today, it is no good."
"590800","592720"," It is a bears wet dream."
"601080","602820"," So we'll monitor it this afternoon. "
"603280","605060"," I have not sold any of my puts threads."
"605740","607520"," I'm still inputs here."
"609620","615840"," But you can see this morning the the artificial holding up of the market. "
"616340","618960"," It could be anybody could be any bank that's doing it right now."
"619320","623360"," Remember Bank is long right now could have easily pumped the market this morning just to try to"
"623360","624040"," hold on to it."
"666880","672260"," An option B for this morning would be that we trade higher and we are rejected or off of. "
"672260","676420"," Now, if you're in the bear, if you're going to be the bear or the bear camp this morning, if"
"676420","679460"," we are going to there's a possibility we trade higher here."
"680020","686240"," Let's say trade higher to four fifty three fifty four or four fifty two fifty eight or four fifty"
"686240","687320"," one fifty eighty four."
"687940","690780"," And we would reject and trade down below this four fifty. "
"691680","693400"," Sell the news kind of a moment."
"696300","699440"," That'd be option two for you as a bear."
"699660","701480"," If you're believing in, we're going to break through. "
"702680","705200"," Back into our lower trading range."
"709180","715120"," If you're neutral here, which is pretty much what I think that I am that would be neutral until end"
"715120","715640"," of the day."
"715920","719300"," You'd see a pump into the market to await the Amazon news. "
"721320","724860"," You're then walking the plank like we talked about yesterday and the day before."
"724860","730340"," Each day we're walking the plank with a big tech name that's there to hold the market up."
"730580","734680"," And we also know that there are panicked bulls that are trying to sell. "
"736020","740700"," You know that above there are at four fifty eight and at four sixty."
"744440","747800"," So you need some kind of a super duper awesome bullish."
"748940","752300"," Reports from Amazon to trade higher. "
"758440","765620"," Without that report, we could do a slow rollover over time over the rest of the week or muted into"
"765620","768060"," February 18th, right?"
"768300","772660"," The OpEx with the rest of the reports coming out."
"781680","784440"," Now the bookcase is a challenge right now."
"787460","792840"," I would be wary though of looking at these Facebook calls as I am buying the dip moments. "
"792840","796340"," This is more to stop the market from burning."
"798260","800300"," Because it's on the cusp right now of burning."
"809840","815380"," That's what you call the fraud candles when you see the Facebook buying right now. "
"824640","827200"," So let's talk about what Eric's asking me this morning."
"827300","828120"," Let's talk about Eric."
"829260","832440"," Grandstrom is asking me why am I holding puts if I am neutral. "
"833360","834280"," That's a good question."
"836880","844120"," So if you trade a market holding just one side at any time."
"847220","850380"," You are eventually going to blow your account up. "
"851060","854820"," It doesn't matter if you are one sided in your trades."
"856340","862200"," If you are constantly bullish and all you hold is calls or you're constantly only holding puts, it"
"862200","862860"," doesn't matter."
"864280","868520"," So especially as we went on gas, increasing its share repurchasing. "
"869340","870460"," Especially as we move."
"870680","874640"," The organization that Michael back in additional 10 million in class A shares."
"878350","882210"," All of your trade should be structured in if this then what?"
"882590","888570"," If this then that you can't just trade one side with naked options. "
"891230","893710"," So as we trade it up from 4 20."
"894830","899750"," I'm trading outside the money calls and buying put protection throughout all of it."
"901430","904730"," And the puts that I have are put spreads with time on them. "
"905050","906690"," So if we make a turn right."
"907890","912030"," If we make a turn going up, I'll start with call spreads with time on them."
"912550","918210"," Then I'll switch to monthly's let's say then weeklies and then eventually FDs and calls right. "
"920750","925730"," If we start to make a turn in the opposite direct or when let's say we're heading up right all"
"925730","926450"," along the way."
"926750","931410"," I'm buying in the money put spreads with time on them that eventually print."
"933410","939450"," And you get a more aggressive with your puts as you get closer to what should be expected as a"
"939450","939790"," reversal. "
"940370","943150"," Or even some sideways down movement before move higher."
"944610","954160"," Yeah, we do"
"954160","957620"," straddles strangles if you are if you are any kind of a trader."
"958800","960880"," Investor and you're just long anything. "
"961420","962280"," It's insane."
"963800","970540"," And you will eventually blow your account up."
"983030","985570"," It's not even a question of if it's just a question of when. "
"993740","999020"," And these these like put spreads don't lose value."
"999560","1002960"," Well, they do in the in the in the term."
"1002960","1007680"," But if they just get to the price they need to be at over time, they print. "
"1008840","1009700"," So why would I?"
"1009840","1011380"," That's the whole point of buying them."
"1013380","1018600"," If I buy them and they lose value as long as they get back to where they need to be."
"1018600","1026319"," I haven't taken any decisions on future policy shifts, but they agree it's sensible not to exclude"
"1026319","1032359"," a 2022 rate hike to consider the end of the APP net buying possible in the third quarter. "
"1032980","1035760"," And then they are said to be preparing for a potential March policy."
"1035760","1041200"," Again, is an ECB summary story just largely taking what the market has traded out of the ECB"
"1041200","1047280"," comments from Lagarde earlier today when she was unwilling to reiterate that she did not see a rate"
"1047280","1050780"," hike in 2022 rates have shot higher the Euro as firm."
"1051420","1056760"," The ECB summary story largely just summarizing what we've seen coming out of that meeting. "
"1058280","1062460"," So the structures of so sometimes I buy put spreads."
"1062580","1065680"," Sometimes I sell calls if I own stock, right?"
"1065800","1066280"," I'll sell puts."
"1067100","1071540"," Sometimes I'll have butterflies, condors. "
"1072340","1073760"," Put back spreads, right?"
"1073960","1074480"," That's where you sell."
"1074860","1075820"," That's where you sell in two."
"1085080","1086220"," Inside the money. "
"1090460","1092340"," So it depends on what I'm doing."
"1092620","1093800"," It depends on the risk level."
"1094400","1097420"," It depends if we're bearish or bullish in context. "
"1099540","1102840"," It depends on how much I read or how much risk I'm taking on."
"1104160","1107480"," If you're taking calls in a bearish."
"1109180","1110500"," Trading range, right?"
"1110740","1111660"," On a channel, right?"
"1111840","1112360"," It's bearish. "
"1113140","1115000"," You need to have heavy protection."
"1115000","1119180"," You have to pay the price for making money."
"1122620","1126300"," So if we bounce off 420, we're heading up towards 460, right?"
"1126880","1130240"," I'm not going to make as much profit until we break above 460. "
"1131100","1136200"," I'm going to then take less protection if we go higher than 460."
"1141280","1144420"," You have people about stock down at 420, right?"
"1144660","1144980"," In companies."
"1145880","1149980"," As we approach 460, they have a few choices, right?"
"1150220","1157520"," They can start to sell puts or calls on their positions right in stock. "
"1158020","1164200"," They can just take put protection on their positions, or they have to sell out of their positions"
"1164200","1165480"," at that time."
"1166000","1169520"," So you have to decide for yourself, what am I doing to protect my money?"
"1172440","1176600"," If you're someone that's like, hey, all I do is buy calls and sell them, or I buy puts and"
"1176600","1177160"," I sell them."
"1178200","1180560"," If that's a hard, hard way to make money. "
"1188680","1190760"," Sometimes they call it a cost of doing business."
"1193420","1195820"," And my puts at this point have paid for themselves."
"1196240","1196520"," They're free. "
"1200720","1202420"," Yeah, the squackers are talking this morning."
"1210230","1212810"," No, so what I also do is I gamble."
"1213250","1220490"," So I will buy stuff like PETA inputs and just hold them because they can, because they have the"
"1220490","1221150"," money for it. "
"1222570","1224070"," I bought some run calls."
"1224370","1224810"," Those are burning."
"1228130","1231330"," That was as a test against trade the news yesterday. "
"1234940","1244900"," But my general trading, my general trading"
"1244900","1250140"," for me making money, the things that I do to make money are not just one-sided."
"1250360","1255440"," They're not just holding outside the money calls overnight here on 30% of my account."
"1260850","1267510"," The only time that I would say that ever works is maybe if you're building an account and you can"
"1267510","1270910"," blow it up a few times to try to get a large enough account. "
"1271650","1274910"," I've heard that argued that you could do stuff like that, right?"
"1274910","1276090"," Let's say you had like 10 grand."
"1276930","1281690"," You wanted to build your account so you'd run it up with two or three great trades that are highly"
"1281690","1282150"," risky."
"1288600","1294500"," I was talking with Joe yesterday and we were talking about, you know, if you have a sizable"
"1294500","1301760"," account, you're not trading all in on one side of a trade. "
"1301760","1303920"," The second half of the year, like a Lima."
"1307960","1310300"," If you do that, eventually you do what you do lose."
"1317500","1318960"," Good morning, Invesco, how are you?"
"1327580","1335260"," We're sitting in a room where you guys are saying, I think that puts through what month, what"
"1335260","1335520"," strike?"
"1336040","1337380"," I kept here in Jordan. "
"1337640","1338500"," We don't have options."
"1339280","1340220"," There's only ways to leverage margin."
"1341560","1342800"," Mys and sounds, really. "
"1343340","1345680"," Thanks, Jafar for saying what you guys have to do."
"1346080","1347580"," Yeah, you've got other countries that can't do."
"1348740","1352720"," I think Canada, they've got a bunch of restrictions as well. "
"1355120","1356620"," Good morning, Invesco, how are you, brother?"
"1358800","1360420"," Yeah, bloodstance, making a fair point."
"1362300","1365040"," Yeah, there was a lot of calls that came into Tesla as well this morning."
"1369810","1373970"," They're like, ABA looks like a buy program. "
"1379280","1381340"," Yeah, exactly, Invesco exactly."
"1383760","1388080"," Yeah, there's a definite buy program into the market this morning."
"1388520","1394160"," It has nothing to do with anything other than saving the market. "
"1395000","1398460"," It's the only intent this morning."
"1402810","1405690"," I don't know which hedge fund it is or which bank it is."
"1407570","1412070"," On an otherwise normal day, if we sold for four fifty, it'd be problems. "
"1421980","1422800"," Thanks, plain."
"1423520","1425260"," Yeah, so I make videos."
"1425920","1427440"," I've made videos in the past. "
"1427620","1433560"," My first, I think my first four or five videos that I've ever made."
"1433640","1442720"," I go through the logic behind how you buy a turn that works in both directions up and down."
"1444560","1447120"," So I'll go through it again briefly right now. "
"1447560","1453760"," So let's say the last two years, we traded within a bull's channel."
"1455900","1458480"," If you're trying to pick the turn, right?"
"1459280","1462820"," If we're going up, we'll use that example, but you can use it on going down as well."
"1464620","1471660"," So if you're heading up right in the normal channel, we traded in the last two years, and you're"
"1471660","1473160"," like, I think we're at a bottom right here. "
"1474320","1476440"," But you could trade down into a lower."
"1476740","1480960"," Let's say there's a nice wide trading channel in the spy specifically."
"1481900","1484940"," And you've got one or you've got like some gray zones below, right?"
"1487140","1493300"," You would start out by catching that first or second turn in case you get a V shape recovery with"
"1493300","1494920"," an in the money dated call. "
"1497080","1502360"," Dated meeting, you've put some time on it one to three months, right?"
"1502500","1505840"," So if you if you missed that, if that isn't the actual by the dip."
"1507300","1509820"," And it takes you another week to get that by the dip."
"1511000","1515140"," But then it takes another week or two to get up to that last point. "
"1515900","1520940"," If you put time and they're in the money, eventually you're coming back there, right?"
"1521220","1522500"," Because they're in that full thesis."
"1524520","1530620"," Now, if whether that was the V shape recovery and you start to head higher there, you can then add"
"1530620","1533520"," you're getting further confirmation to get more bullish."
"1537420","1540240"," But I did a bit I did some videos on this in the past. "
"1546070","1547970"," And then you get more aggressive and more aggressive."
"1550750","1559170"," So as we had so as we have had higher headed higher from 420, I've added put spreads at certain"
"1559170","1559870"," points, right?"
"1560390","1565910"," So as an example today or yesterday we rolled over at four for 60, right?"
"1566470","1568050"," We're safe down to 450."
"1569150","1573030"," I posted on Twitter that you don't want to break 450, right?"
"1573030","1578450"," 450, 86 or 81, I think I said, to 450 flat. "
"1578790","1581950"," And we tagged 450, 01 for a reason."
"1584030","1588070"," You don't want to break that, especially about the day after."
"1589550","1596990"," Because it opens the door to a trading range of 450 in change or so. "
"1600270","1603310"," All the way down to a 431 20."
"1609980","1611540"," That would be your next support."
"1611960","1618220"," If you did a slow rollover down below, you'd have some minor supports down below that at 446, 443. "
"1621720","1626080"," Then you could trade in this range, then slowly trade down to, let's say, 436."
"1627040","1627980"," Time is then on your hand."
"1629060","1632660"," But if you break through today, you don't want to break through 450. "
"1633440","1636120"," You don't want Amazon to have a bad ER today."
"1637640","1646240"," My suspicion would be also that if Amazon's ER is okay, not great, but you'll see another attempt"
"1646240","1649740"," by banks to prop the market up with Amazon."
"1652120","1656800"," Turkish President Erdogan renewing is offered to provide mediation between Russia and Ukraine. "
"1659880","1666840"," Even if to only hold the market up for ERs from mid caps, some of the rest of the large"
"1666840","1667880"," caps that have to report."
"1669760","1671720"," But there can be ramifications too."
"1672500","1677240"," Just like we had ramifications across social media stocks yesterday, we could have ramifications"
"1677240","1683180"," across any of the stay-at-home shopping stocks, hard-good stocks that haven't reported yet. "
"1707450","1714270"," I'm still looking for a rejection here off of roughly almost 454."
"1715490","1716930"," We'll see if it comes or not."
"1726140","1727620"," We'll take a look above here. "
"1742790","1744230"," Lots of traffic here."
"1773600","1780640"," Same sellers above at 461, 460, 459."
"1782080","1784460"," Then just traffic where we are right now. "
"1786420","1796350"," We have ice to actually more ice than I"
"1796350","1796930"," expected above."
"1801130","1807090"," I figured it would end right around 454ish, right around there at 454."
"1807090","1810370"," But there's some above. "
"1828180","1829980"," Yeah, sellers are not hiding."
"1830280","1831080"," The bears are out."
"1834740","1839240"," The shorts aren't covering in a traditional sense. "
"1839640","1842560"," They're covering to wait for a rejection from up high."
"1866300","1868220"," We'll take a look and see if anybody got other puts."
"1868340","1868760"," Let's see a question. "
"1869660","1871260"," Let's look at the 18th."
"1903240","1905140"," Let's go through all the chains real quick."
"1907620","1909240"," We've got 11,000 contracts. "
"1910180","1911040"," Let me look at today's."
"1919170","1924790"," For today, we've got 93,000 contracts on 450P."
"1926290","1928630"," That's the put side of the spy. "
"1929410","1939310"," On February 7th, there are 12,000 contracts for 50P."
"1947460","1951100"," On the 9th, there are 9,000 a concentration at 450P."
"1951820","1965040"," A couple"
"1965040","1971260"," of concentrations on the 11th at 450, 445, and then 440P. "
"1971520","1974040"," There's almost a 7,000 contracts there."
"1975580","1979440"," There's 8,000 contracts at 425P."
"1986760","2000340"," Some concentration"
"2000340","2003300"," on the February 14th at 430P. "
"2005020","2006120"," Not big though."
"2036940","2039640"," 450P on February 18th at 450P."
"2039820","2041440"," There's a concentration for 40P. "
"2042180","2042540"," There's a concentration."
"2042540","2044120"," A concentration."
"2048420","2053820"," What is good to see is that the really large put positions on February 18th are now gone. "
"2056540","2058239"," On the spy on the 18th."
"2059520","2065239"," I thought they rolled them to March, but we'll look real quick and see if they have or if they've"
"2065239","2066020"," pulled them off."
"2077000","2079659"," I thought they rolled them the other day like three days ago. "
"2081219","2083060"," That's good March 18th."
"2093320","2095560"," That is some, but not what there was."
"2096980","2098260"," There's some at 400. "
"2099340","2102940"," March 18th looks like they rolled to 400P."
"2110210","2110830"," 430P."
"2129620","2130680"," Just a second. "
"2130800","2131260"," Let me check some."
"2182150","2185090"," I'm going to read something to this from this morning from spot gamma."
"2185930","2193120"," It says about a minute now to the weekly and after gas inventory date expected between minus two"
"2193120","2195960"," hundred eighty and minus two hundred seventy seven billing cubic feet. "
"2207040","2212260"," Read this morning spot gamma's daily notes as features are down from last night's close to four"
"2212260","2213320"," five to seven."
"2213820","2218740"," Despite the reduction in S&P prices, there was a build in our gamma index, which equates that I"
"2218740","2219520"," reduced volatility."
"2219520","2223060"," The volatility estimate for today point six seven percent. "
"2224660","2226900"," The natural gas inventory data in just a few seconds."
"2240480","2242160"," I'm going to mute this for just a minute here."
"2242760","2243560"," Minus two hundred sixty. "
"2253680","2257120"," So futures are down from last night's close at four five five two seven."
"2257120","2260760"," Despite the reduction in S&P prices, there was a build in our gamma index, which creates that I"
"2260760","2263780"," reduced volatility estimate for today at point six seven percent."
"2264260","2268420"," Key support is at four five two zero and forty five hundred. "
"2268880","2275180"," The resistance that's above right is at four five four two and four five six four."
"2276760","2282040"," The Facebook earnings fiasco certainly took the winds out of the markets sales and led to a closing"
"2282040","2282720"," VIX spike."
"2282720","2288840"," As a result, our risk reversal metric ended with some fairly put weighted figures suggesting a"
"2288840","2290320"," scramble for downside into the close. "
"2291060","2295840"," The other thing to note is that we had a sneaky build sneaky right quiet build in the S&P"
"2295840","2304560"," and QQ gamma expiring on Friday as traders have pushed into short duration put positions or short"
"2304560","2304900"," positions."
"2304900","2311760"," IE meaning that there are people buying protection that is expiring today's expiry and Friday's"
"2311760","2312180"," expiry."
"2312660","2316980"," We just listed off where those positions were on those two expirations. "
"2319560","2320600"," Let's see here."
"2321620","2331430"," We see minus or we see roughly equal to twenty percent of spy and fifteen"
"2331430","2335010"," percent of QQ gamma expiring Friday."
"2335010","2339510"," We think that builds today as Amazon and others report earnings. "
"2340250","2344830"," You can see below how concentrated tomorrow's expiration like gray is around current QQ prices for"
"2344830","2346930"," that reason associated hedging flows, pinning."
"2347550","2349790"," We anticipate the market holding pretty tight to current levels."
"2350890","2356710"," As this game expires Friday, it may release the current market prices particularly to the upside. "
"2357390","2360850"," So the point being is they're going to pin the market from today into Friday hopefully."
"2362370","2366750"," But not for Friday, but for Amazon's reporting today."
"2367210","2375370"," So basically they're saying that they're going to pin the market today anticipating Amazon's"
"2375370","2377230"," release, right?"
"2377450","2382810"," So everybody's loaded to the tips and puts regardless of what it costs. "
"2384210","2387430"," In case Amazon gives out bad earnings."
"2387830","2393070"," If they don't give up bad earnings, they'll close those put positions and the market should trade"
"2393070","2393570"," higher."
"2395950","2402410"," If Amazon does report bad earnings, they're protected for the market to burn. "
"2407790","2412710"," We also note, this is from spy gamma this morning, we also note a fair amount of gamma position to"
"2412710","2417750"," have forty six hundred, which adds resistance to a push higher in the S&P before Friday."
"2419310","2422410"," Forty five hundred should be viewed as a large support line."
"2422930","2426990"," But if it is broken, it may set off a fresh bout of extended volatility. "
"2428050","2433490"," Our models seem to suggest forty three fifty five would be the next material support below forty"
"2433490","2434050"," five hundred."
"2436670","2440490"," To be clear, we give an edge to the markets holding to our volatility estimates for today."
"2440490","2443490"," But the downside risks here are material. "
"2444250","2449210"," This rally was driven in large part by the reduction in put positions and or put values, right?"
"2450350","2453090"," Dropping the event trade, which drives dealer delta buybacks."
"2453110","2458850"," We've seen that put cover flow stall the last few days, which is not terribly surprising even the"
"2458850","2459730"," magnitude of the rally."
"2460190","2463950"," However, there's not been a demand for index calls, right?"
"2464090","2468730"," There's been no demand for outside the money dated calls. "
"2468730","2470870"," Like, hey, we're trading above four sixty."
"2471170","2472070"," We know we're going to four eighty."
"2472410","2473510"," We know we're going to five hundred. "
"2473590","2474430"," We know we're going to five ten."
"2476210","2481070"," You don't see you need to see those extended call that extended call buying."
"2481530","2486490"," You can't just see every day like a day to a one day, three day, or even a five day"
"2486490","2488330"," call that's in the money. "
"2488650","2489770"," That's all we've been seeing."
"2489790","2495990"," Even on every rip higher, most people are buying very short dated in the money calls."
"2496530","2498390"," Nobody's like, hey, I'm buying four eighties. "
"2498610","2499110"," We're going there."
"2499550","2502810"," Even if you hear that on social media, no one's actually doing it."
"2506770","2509910"," So it has not been a demand for index calls, right?"
"2510370","2514910"," There was a variation bid for single stock calls to start the week, but that faded sharply"
"2514910","2515590"," yesterday. "
"2516170","2519730"," Call buying is what can extend the rally when the put cover stalls out."
"2520150","2523330"," This is because as stocks rise dealers should be buying more stock, right?"
"2523330","2524490"," Gamma hedging."
"2524690","2528030"," This along with decline in implied volatility keeps a bid in the markets. "
"2528470","2531510"," That's what gives you the true vantage rally, which we have not seen."
"2532070","2536810"," Because if we had a real than a rally, we would actually trade two all-time highs or close to"
"2536810","2537910"," it just below."
"2538070","2541570"," We'd probably trade a four seventy four. "
"2541750","2543110"," How big that decline was."
"2546450","2551330"," Should demand for downside protection renew, it will add negative deltas to a weakened market."
"2551330","2555950"," This suggests dealers would be shorting the futures with gamma at on the negative gamma flip point"
"2555950","2557030"," implied volatility level. "
"2557410","2562390"," That means that while we documented our view that forty three hundred was a lower bound early last"
"2562390","2568390"," week, we'd estimate that something like less than or equal to four twenty may show as a lower bound"
"2568390","2570250"," for the second leg down."
"2570790","2573550"," One final note for those of you watching Facebook."
"2574150","2577230"," Our models show that at the two hundred and fifteen dollar work. "
"2577350","2579970"," Gamma induced volatility diminishes this implied in the chart below."
"2580370","2583170"," When the call gamma blew line and blew up orange line flat."
"2583390","2583930"," Not two fifty. "
"2585410","2586510"," That's not something we're thinking about."
"2586730","2588250"," So basically what the saying is the same stuff."
"2589290","2594550"," If let's say Amazon today reports ugly earnings, right?"
"2595650","2597050"," You would then see more. "
"2597930","2598710"," Put flow."
"2600250","2601270"," Aggressive put flow."
"2602350","2604210"," If we break for fifty. "
"2605150","2607710"," You will see nasty numbers."
"2608270","2614370"," You will you'll see it's somewhere it's typically if we were to recheck under normal circumstances"
"2614370","2615230"," down below."
"2616050","2622190"," As we as time passes and we trade higher that bottom number raises right goes from like four twenty"
"2622190","2624390"," to four thirty then four forty. "
"2625790","2629370"," Or for a trade back right versus or snap back you can call whatever you want."
"2631090","2635210"," But because of the time right because where we are with just this last week left."
"2635750","2637950"," And if we have a vicious sell down below. "
"2638910","2640450"," We break that four fifty."
"2642590","2645710"," And if they were to add more puts just aggressive put buying."
"2646490","2650670"," You would see less than four twenty you'd see it's it's no less than four fifteen. "
"2651350","2654330"," Four one five zero and it could be as deep."
"2655290","2660430"," As three ninety so I've seen some some people are saying three sixty."
"2661130","2663350"," That low that's how low it could actually go. "
"2665550","2668050"," So there's real risk here so what do you do as a trader today."
"2669590","2670030"," Right."
"2670190","2672890"," I think off the ballot you were just looking at Facebook. "
"2673550","2678390"," You'd say oh you'd buy Facebook calls right here at this point you'd buy some spy calls were going"
"2678390","2678730"," higher."
"2678730","2683190"," The reality is that they're going to pin the market so that it doesn't crash."
"2684010","2689190"," Not crash but you know that in terms of a day or two it's not going to crash currently. "
"2689830","2691690"," They're going to prop it up as much as they can."
"2693130","2695890"," If you're a bull you're going to get trapped in that at some point today."
"2697330","2702490"," And if you're being bearish you want to wait or if you're bull let's say you're holding stock at"
"2702490","2703810"," some point today on a high. "
"2704330","2710250"," You more than likely want to protect your position with puts into the close for Amazon."
"2711410","2713450"," Because they're telling you right now."
"2714650","2719470"," That the market is positioned for either side of that trade. "
"2722710","2726410"," Now there are other factors in that trade too you have to think about people that are just long"
"2726410","2727690"," this market do they just sell."
"2728570","2729830"," And wait to see what happens."
"2731230","2735350"," If you're a bull and you're not owning anything long right now and you want to take along. "
"2736010","2738870"," You're just best to wait until after the Amazon reports."
"2739470","2744510"," Because you're literally putting yourself at risk of a market sell off to minus 420."
"2746050","2749710"," Can your account handle a sell off minus 420. "
"2751030","2756650"," Is the markets positioned for that move to potentially take place into the close today."
"2761050","2765790"," Right so there so you don't have it's not like you're saying hey I'm super bearish down to 400."
"2766290","2770830"," It's that you are prepared for it either by waiting out right now sitting out. "
"2771410","2773010"," Or you've got the protection on."
"2774530","2777910"," And if Amazon you know Farts rainbows out of their asshole."
"2778350","2782950"," And they've got you know butterfly wings and the sun comes out and the flowers and the grass is"
"2782950","2784970"," green and flowers are pretty colors. "
"2786090","2790210"," You release that put side of your protection and we trade higher."
"2795440","2797680"," I'm not looking at any of your comments right now by the way."
"2803290","2806130"," Does any of that make sense to all of you out there right now. "
"2813540","2815160"," Yes Carrie you should have stayed in bed."
"2816100","2818700"," Do you guys understand everything that I'm saying to you."
"2820540","2822340"," Hey John I'm sure Facebook yesterday. "
"2822340","2823040"," This is a stream."
"2823200","2824960"," Right on."
"2826160","2827420"," Make sure you like subscribe. "
"2827880","2829640"," This brought this broadcast John."
"2830520","2831800"," You made money yesterday."
"2832100","2834380"," Please leave a tip to to help support it. "
"2838000","2841620"," Do you guys understand right now when I really know inside the comments."
"2841620","2844160"," Do you understand what I'm saying to you."
"2849990","2851670"," You guys all understand right. "
"2852270","2855450"," So you've got all this call buying right now."
"2855770","2860290"," This call buying is not meant to rip the market higher to all time highs."
"2861130","2862970"," It is only meant to prop it up. "
"2863450","2866390"," It's it's probably meant by someone that's long right."
"2866550","2870250"," You've got a bank or someone that's like well shit we're long can't sell the market and then if"
"2870250","2872270"," retail panics can't let them sell it."
"2872690","2874330"," So we're gonna prop it up for our positioning. "
"2875670","2880150"," And then we're gonna load the shit out of shorts and puts in case Amazon fucks this up."
"2881490","2884010"," In the moment reporting is done."
"2886490","2889970"," They can let go of the put side of their trade and we'll take it long again. "
"2890870","2891350"," Entire."
"2892030","2892790"," But they are positioned."
"2895590","2896590"," They are positioned. "
"2896910","2900830"," I promise you they're positioned this morning to sell this to sell it."
"2910790","2915330"," Yes now if everybody is loaded and Amazon puts isn't there a country and play for some calls this"
"2915330","2915770"," afternoon."
"2916030","2916890"," Yeah you can. "
"2917350","2920250"," So there's some here's some strategies for you."
"2921410","2922910"," Here are some strategies for you."
"2923650","2927410"," You can strangle the entire market you can straddle the entire market. "
"2929490","2933650"," You can literally sit there to get pen and paper right and you let's say you spend a thousand"
"2933650","2935510"," dollars on outside the money calls."
"2935510","2937130"," You wait until."
"2939150","2943630"," Well I don't know four forty five or three forty five three thirty to buy those. "
"2944290","2946230"," No matter where we are because they're going to drain them."
"2946330","2947950"," They're going to kill anything you buy today."
"2948490","2949490"," Anything naked right. "
"2951130","2954830"," So if you're going to buy this here you're like I want to buy calls this market end of day."
"2955310","2956750"," I would wait until end of day."
"2956850","2957490"," I would personally. "
"2958070","2962210"," So you just get the maximum knock out effect on it right and you have to have a price target."
"2962210","2965910"," You say okay wherever let's say wherever we are at the end of day."
"2966930","2968070"," As an example. "
"2968570","2972330"," Let's say spy end of day was was tagged right at four fifty."
"2972730","2974450"," Just give you as a as an example."
"2975090","2977230"," I'm not telling you it would be there for fifty at the end of the day. "
"2977290","2979150"," Let's just say right for fifty right."
"2981130","2983870"," And we'll use a thousand dollars as an example."
"2984210","2988550"," So you spend a thousand dollars on four sixty calls. "
"2991230","2993990"," So you go out your your options."
"2996370","3000450"," Your options profit calculator whatever you figure out what a thousand dollars prints you."
"3001910","3002850"," To four sixty. "
"3004830","3005750"," We'll do it right now."
"3006410","3008590"," We can do it with you right now actually want to do it we'll do it together."
"3009190","3011850"," So I've never done an actual example of this for anybody so we'll do it now. "
"3012870","3014070"," Do it live dammit."
"3016930","3018910"," A whole lot of second here will do a lot."
"3019150","3020970"," So I'm breaking out options profit calculator. "
"3021730","3024370"," No you can't you can but you don't have to calculate."
"3025530","3029750"," For just a back like a back testing kind of a thing."
"3030250","3031350"," You don't have to calculate. "
"3033110","3035530"," Interest and premium and IV and all that kind of stuff."
"3036530","3038190"," And we know it's Amazon right."
"3038390","3041390"," I don't want to get stuck in the Amazon IV crush in either direction. "
"3044090","3048430"," But I know Amazon's a big waiter in the spy right and it's a big waiter in the cues."
"3050010","3051390"," So I'm going to get February 4th."
"3053010","3055990"," And I'm going to look at the four sixty calls just right now. "
"3056850","3058010"," What what they are right."
"3058910","3062790"," So you got four sixty C will just pretend that there's no change right there."
"3062870","3064170"," Thirty one cents each. "
"3069260","3071020"," Cost me thirty one dollars right."
"3071780","3073460"," So I'm going to take a calculator here."
"3075900","3079740"," I'm going to take a thousand dollars divided by thirty one dollars. "
"3081140","3082920"," That gives me thirty two contracts."
"3084020","3086740"," So I'm going to change my contracts to thirty two contracts."
"3088420","3090320"," Cost me nine hundred ninety two dollars. "
"3093000","3095560"," And I know by tomorrow if we hit four sixty."
"3096920","3098760"," We have a pen here hold on."
"3108700","3112000"," Now I know I spent a thousand I spent nine hundred ninety two dollars. "
"3113740","3116500"," And if we had a four sixty tomorrow right or Friday."
"3118040","3124320"," It's going to net me seven thousand nine hundred thirty six dollars basically eight grand."
"3125660","3126960"," To make eight times. "
"3129200","3133900"," On my nine hundred my thousand dollar cost right."
"3135440","3136780"," That's if we go to four sixty."
"3139780","3143220"," Now let's say we're going to sell the market at the end of the day. "
"3143880","3145180"," We have some bad news coming."
"3149490","3153870"," And we're right where we are currently we're going to sell the market Amazon sells down."
"3157250","3160390"," I spent a thousand dollars nine hundred ninety two dollars. "
"3160550","3164250"," I don't want to lose that nine hundred ninety two dollars right."
"3167530","3170310"," I've got a bias that Amazon is going to report good earnings."
"3174070","3175710"," So spending nine hundred ninety two dollars. "
"3175790","3176870"," I don't want to lose that money right."
"3182650","3185010"," We're at four fifty one ninety seven right now."
"3186490","3191270"," I'm going to look in here. "
"3201960","3204200"," First I'm going to look at the four forty five."
"3215650","3217670"," Look at the four forty five P's."
"3220470","3222650"," Ten of those cost me nine hundred and eighty bucks. "
"3228190","3228710"," Acculate."
"3235560","3241000"," That makes me two thousand eight hundred and eighty dollars if we trade down to four forty five by"
"3241000","3241280"," Friday."
"3242400","3242760"," Okay. "
"3243560","3246580"," So for two thousand dollars that I laid out on the table."
"3246580","3249380"," So I'm laying out two grand on a day today."
"3250440","3251700"," Two thousand dollars right. "
"3252660","3254660"," If the market trades up to four sixty."
"3256720","3258300"," On kick ass great news."
"3260400","3265380"," On Friday I have the potential to make eight thousand dollars right. "
"3265880","3268140"," You can probably cut my put side loose tomorrow as well."
"3268600","3270340"," Or even after the bell like four fifteen."
"3270980","3272020"," I could cut my put side loose. "
"3273560","3277440"," So maybe I lose off my nine eighty that I spent on puts on my lose four eighty."
"3277780","3279740"," That's it's called let's say we will ask five hundred bucks."
"3280300","3282420"," Still going to have four and eighty bucks they saved. "
"3283720","3287820"," And we're probably going to trade up to at least four sixty on Friday."
"3288320","3289500"," If not four fifty five."
"3289860","3291300"," If we trade a four sixty though tomorrow. "
"3291880","3295860"," The potential to make eight hundred percent off of that thousand bucks that I laid out."
"3296040","3297480"," Plus I got my other five five hundred back."
"3298240","3298320"," Right. "
"3298500","3299180"," So I get that money back."
"3300060","3304020"," So I basically lost five hundred dollars on that trade."
"3304580","3310100"," But my potential is I want to make eight eight eight thousand eight thousand or eight hundred"
"3310100","3311300"," percent on that trade. "
"3314900","3315500"," Right."
"3315700","3318020"," One thousand I'll turn into eight thousand dollars."
"3318820","3323600"," So now I probably end up walking out of that trade with three hundred percent profit. "
"3325020","3326540"," Four hundred percent profit."
"3327480","3330200"," On the high end maybe six or seven hundred percent profit."
"3330540","3333340"," But shit if I just if I just made a hundred percent profit. "
"3335460","3339980"," On that trade and and no matter what didn't lose my nine hundred dollars."
"3341980","3342960"," I won right."
"3343360","3343660"," I won. "
"3344280","3344540"," I won."
"3344860","3345860"," I don't care if we went up."
"3346180","3347300"," I don't care if we went down. "
"3347680","3352140"," The only thing this trade in particular doesn't really work for is if we were to trade sideways."
"3353540","3354260"," On Friday."
"3355760","3357320"," If we didn't go up or down. "
"3371160","3373540"," Yeah well we can there's other ways to do this too right."
"3373720","3376680"," You can just take spreads and cut a leg off them."
"3383770","3385450"," Okay some other summarize this again. "
"3387350","3388590"," No I can't."
"3389950","3391530"," But you have to decide what you're going to do."
"3392210","3392330"," Right. "
"3392330","3395050"," What you do end of day today."
"3396910","3401250"," I think the original question was what like what can you do to trade this market today."
"3404470","3406130"," Or how do you trade this market today. "
"3410390","3415730"," So for me where I am in the market as we traded higher I traded."
"3416550","3421330"," Outside the money calls on out to the money inside the money calls that were one day two day or"
"3421330","3422150"," three day or zero dates."
"3422150","3425130"," Remember the most available one was right I wrote this market up. "
"3425550","3432290"," And when we got to the four fifty one four fifty two about put spreads for much lower though for"
"3432290","3432970"," twenties I bought."
"3434730","3436610"," But I bought them at four fifty one."
"3438810","3444490"," About some about some in the money put spreads that were dated out to the 18th for four forty and"
"3444490","3445290"," four forty two. "
"3464760","3466320"," Hey everybody how's everybody doing."
"3472870","3477630"," So I'll be one option to trade that way one way to trade today will be another way to trade"
"3477630","3477930"," today."
"3479030","3484870"," Another way for you if you're a bull right is you can't just take a long here because if you"
"3484870","3486650"," take just a long position here. "
"3487910","3491790"," It's going to get grounded dust and if it goes the wrong way you lose all of your money."
"3494490","3494890"," Right."
"3506790","3508810"," Sound is a bit low you guys hear my sound. "

"4138689","4141970"," What else do we have a significant reason for the psych market to go up after that."
"4143430","4145529"," That sort cuts both ways Joe Mo. "
"4145529","4147229"," I agree with that right."
"4147410","4149410"," What do you have for positive catalysts?"
"4149810","4154590"," But if you don't have negative catalysts either, they can make the market slowly move higher."
"4156250","4158250"," I'm getting slammed on run, bro. "
"4158649","4160250"," Josh, I'm getting hammered on run."
"4162830","4169350"," I'm losing my shirt on run."
"4169689","4172850"," About 30 minutes now the European cash equity close. "
"4173229","4177029"," We're seeing bond yields continue to move higher across the continent."
"4177029","4178750"," The Italian 10 year up 20."
"4179029","4180609"," The German 10 year boomed up 10. "
"4181149","4185370"," Portugal 10 year yield up 15 and the 10 year guilt up 11."
"4186290","4192250"," The French 10 year old up 12 basis points on the day after we heard from the ECB earlier today."
"4197680","4199480"," I'm missing the entire conversation. "
"4199680","4201180"," Markets trading near the lows of the day."
"4202120","4206720"," Down about one and a quarter percent for the Dax and one roughly one and a half percent for the"
"4206720","4206900"," cat."
"4207540","4211180"," With less than 30 minutes to go to cash equity close there in Europe. "
"4211980","4215740"," I don't know what's going on with this conversation."
"4216180","4216740"," I must have missed something."
"4219440","4221760"," What's a nasty report made developers at Roblox?"
"4222060","4222240"," Okay. "
"4222460","4227360"," So if there's a short report on Roblox this morning, I don't know what the conversation is right"
"4227360","4227600"," now."
"4228600","4233200"," It's kind of funny that there would be a short report because that information has been known for."
"4234460","4237380"," I want to say months or maybe in six months. "
"4237540","4242160"," There was a develop not enough as a moderator in a discord for Roblox."
"4243480","4251980"," You can look this up on YouTube or Reddit and he was trying to talk to kids or some shit"
"4251980","4252420"," like that."
"4253080","4260660"," Keep it on kids or something and he was called out a bunch and the company didn't do anything about"
"4260660","4260860"," it. "
"4260860","4265880"," Then the guy was fired or disappeared and it wound up being because Sony or some other partner"
"4265880","4267740"," company got involved."
"4268380","4271020"," It could have been Microsoft or Sony."
"4271540","4273360"," So maybe they're bringing out a short report now. "
"4273800","4277160"," But it's kind of funny because that stuff was all public information."
"4277540","4278800"," It's not like it was rocket science."
"4279740","4287560"," I follow that story because my children play Roblox and we don't allow them to go into any of the"
"4287560","4287880"," other rooms. "
"4288340","4290420"," They don't want to talk to anybody that kind of stuff."
"4292740","4293360"," So whatever."
"4298520","4302500"," I was just asking my hair routine to be the same length. "
"4304420","4306100"," Yeah, you know, I left a run open."
"4306600","4308420"," I should have closed them, but I still left them open."
"4309060","4315880"," I'm interested in what the what the report or what their report is and that whole story on Ford if"
"4315880","4318300"," that's actually going to take place with their report as well. "
"4321890","4324570"," I was sitting at him and I liked the prime prices."
"4327330","4331850"," Yeah, I would say that's shot in the dark on Amazon raising or hikes their prime prices."
"4332010","4332570"," That's just nonsense. "
"4337280","4339080"," The bear cave is a room in Roblox."
"4339180","4340940"," Okay, I don't think about that stuff."
"4345480","4346740"," They have caught up at this point. "
"4347620","4350300"," I'm probably talking about stuff that you guys aren't even talking about."
"4354380","4355520"," How do I do my hair?"
"4355520","4357420"," So let me see if I can put my camera on."
"4360680","4361480"," Hold on. "
"4361580","4363140"," And we see is my camera on."
"4363780","4367140"," I don't even know if my camera is on right now or not."
"4368840","4369460"," No camera. "
"4370620","4371520"," Okay, hold on."
"4374280","4379120"," It's not seeing a report of a 6.2 magnitude earthquake in northern Peru."
"4408390","4409170"," Where's my coffee?"
"4411620","4412920"," I think I want to take a break right back. "
"4468020","4468860"," Okay, let's see."
"4471470","4471950"," Okay."
"4474890","4476130"," Let's see what you guys are saying. "
"4477510","4477990"," Tesla."
"4488790","4489270"," So."
"4489510","4490410"," Oh, yeah. "
"4495720","4496320"," Yeah."
"4497120","4499680"," So how do I use lines or what I use lines main."
"4501880","4503360"," For my hair every morning. "
"4506160","4509380"," Too funny."
"4510040","4512320"," I use lines main for my hair."
"4513640","4518800"," It's a mixture of sawdust and I saw some, uh, saw some photo where. "
"4520400","4524740"," I saw some photo where some guy had a soap with a sawdust in it or some shit."
"4525080","4531040"," I was like, who the fuck would, would wash their bodies with, with sawdust soap."
"4534740","4536420"," Analyze meta stock, please. "
"4536620","4539320"," What is your opinion on this 25% crash?"
"4540040","4542780"," My opinion on it right now is that's being pinned or held up."
"4546420","4547920"," It's being pinned right now."
"4547960","4551620"," It's waiting for the Amazon, uh, release at the end of the day. "
"4553680","4554340"," That's all."
"4554460","4555100"," That's all that's happening."
"4555340","4558540"," There's someone long into in Facebook right now or the market. "
"4559080","4562900"," And so they're artificially pinning Facebook from selling any deeper."
"4565540","4569640"," There's also a note out from spot."
"4569640","4570300"," I'm a saying. "
"4573580","4575360"," That you don't want to break to 50."
"4579800","4580920"," Which of course we have."
"4583040","4585020"," Henry, did I miss something from your brother?"
"4586500","4587900"," I know you have to get in touch. "
"4589920","4591440"," Sorry, I'm missing you guys comments."
"4591600","4593120"," I am just trying to get through them."
"4593440","4599260"," I had some coffee this morning and I asked my daughter to bring another coffee cup. "
"4599260","4600800"," She took both of my coffee cups."
"4601460","4603540"," I'm asking her if she'd make me a cup of coffee."
"4605720","4609660"," The empty plus will pay to ship you a huge bottle of tide overnight for free. "
"4610320","4610800"," What?"
"4611240","4613820"," What are you guys talking about teas in the gap in the other day?"
"4614540","4615160"," No, it's not."
"4615560","4616540"," What is no, it's not."
"4618840","4619760"," That's the question. "
"4620240","4621340"," How far will Peton?"
"4622000","4626360"," I've got a whole reason why I'm short Peton, but you guys talked to you guys about that."
"4627280","4628360"," Good morning, Lone Wolf."
"4628500","4628800"," How are you?"
"4629880","4630680"," Who am I missing?"
"4633160","4634040"," I'm missing a bunch. "
"4634240","4635400"," What are you guys talking about here?"
"4636940","4637980"," There's a link to Bear Cave."
"4638160","4639000"," His name is Owen Dorsey."
"4639240","4640200"," He puts out short reports. "
"4640440","4640820"," Nothing right."
"4641060","4641840"," Take companies down."
"4642280","4643600"," Yeah, I've heard of Edwin Dorsey. "
"4644620","4645380"," I've heard of him."
"4646120","4646600"," Another Bear Cave."
"4647920","4648440"," It's funny. "
"4648580","4650220"," If he put that short report out, right?"
"4650840","4656480"," She go back there and talk to him and ask him why he's taking easy, easy shorts because there's a"
"4656480","4663600"," big YouTube thing about this controversy about this information that he probably is saying that he"
"4663600","4665460"," are claiming that he found."
"4667020","4669300"," So he's probably just scraping a button."
"4669440","4672680"," He probably saw that information on the internet and said I'm going to call it my own. "
"4673720","4675240"," I'm probably making money off that, right?"
"4678140","4681900"," Move up the Amazon does a stock split, but earnings disappoint at an average."
"4682680","4685180"," Well, there's one good thing about Amazon, right?"
"4685440","4695380"," Do you guys know about how Amazon's expectations for this quarter are significantly"
"4695380","4700500"," lower than they have been in the past significantly?"
"4701420","4704900"," They'll probably beat their ER report."
"4705920","4706780"," It's more about guidance. "
"4706780","4709000"," That's what we really like."
"4709140","4709600"," What is the guidance?"
"4710300","4712180"," Are they charging me any more money on?"
"4714980","4715680"," On prime?"
"4716100","4717600"," Are they going to split their stock?"
"4718060","4723060"," If you don't get that and let's say they beat or let's say BDR, they just scrape by."
"4723880","4731560"," It wouldn't shock me to see the market stay propped up because if you go by other tickers in the"
"4731560","4739140"," past, you would see the market sell heavily on just basically just barely beating expectations. "
"4739880","4742960"," Joe was commenting on it before that expectations don't call me on this."
"4743160","4744460"," They used to be like 12 to 14."
"4745040","4746740"," And now they're like two bucks or something like that. "
"4747640","4750720"," So it shouldn't be difficult for them to beat their ER expectations."
"4751700","4754840"," It could be used for just proper market up."
"4758190","4759110"," Burn, baby burn. "
"4759550","4761030"," Does F6 have copper mines improve?"
"4761410","4761710"," I don't know."
"4765170","4766690"," Henry, what is there it is?"
"4767630","4769090"," Henry, I keep messing with something from you."
"4769850","4770670"," What do you think of all this?"
"4770810","4771990"," The Fed were to call for a rate hike. "
"4772250","4773610"," It was a rate five rating."
"4774550","4775150"," Price mark."
"4775510","4777330"," But we do have a problem, Joe Mo. "
"4777590","4785390"," And the problem is that there's a thought process out there that if we..."
"4785390","4791070"," If we're curbing inflation in the United States right now, that we're not going to need rate hikes"
"4791070","4791730"," at some point."
"4792710","4795610"," It doesn't matter if the market trades lower sideways or up or whatever."
"4796190","4799430"," It has to do with bond yields, bonds, stuff like that. "
"4801010","4803170"," It has to do with a..."
"4803170","4805590"," A whole bunch of the crap in the market table right now."
"4806510","4808210"," Which is happening on its own, right?"
"4808470","4811710"," If you get cheaper prices, it also has to do with the price of goods overseas."
"4813250","4815510"," Coming into the country, it has to do with the dollar being strong. "
"4815750","4821090"," It has to do with people spending money, people going back to work."
"4821550","4822550"," All these other things we need, right?"
"4822850","4826990"," We need people producing more than they're working, right?"
"4827250","4828310"," All these different things that need to happen."
"4828550","4829870"," It looks like, look at what's starting to happen. "
"4830310","4836650"," It's not a good look though for other countries not debasing their currencies."
"4837890","4840770"," Right now, it actually backs up us committing to raising rates."
"4844630","4845310"," And..."
"4845310","4846830"," Oh, which brand?"
"4848410","4849510"," Old Cougar. "
"4849790","4851230"," Old Cougar Lions main."
"4853770","4854870"," Main and tail."
"4856490","4857850"," Yeah, exfoliating. "
"4859690","4862010"," What are my thoughts on..."
"4862770","4864170"," What are my thoughts on..."
"4864170","4865270"," What are my thoughts..."
"4865270","4865730"," Hold on here."
"4867290","4867830"," Head and shoulders."
"4868290","4871130"," Yeah, we are forming a..."
"4871130","4871990"," That's a good point. "
"4872570","4873530"," So we're going to talk about a few things."
"4875750","4876450"," Okay, so..."
"4877670","4878950"," Tail's made head and shoulders hilarious."
"4882390","4884790"," So, Henry, I'm missing everything that you're talking about here, bro. "
"4885390","4886630"," I don't even know what you're talking about."
"4886770","4887970"," I missed whatever you were saying earlier."
"4890370","4891230"," Are you going to cut your hair?"
"4892450","4893050"," I caught it. "
"4893230","4894250"," I let it go out of my shoulders."
"4895090","4896270"," I put it up in..."
"4896270","4897150"," I can't believe what I was."
"4897250","4898190"," I put it up in a knot, right?"
"4898930","4901310"," I do the hipster douchebag knot sometimes. "
"4904550","4905610"," Sometimes I just let it flow."
"4918020","4919260"," That's how they..."
"4920280","4922440"," Hey, Eddie, how you doing?"
"4928520","4934820"," I'm doing it based on a whole bunch of shit from Nicola, to be honest with you."
"4935760","4937440"," I'm paying my tithing. "
"4938740","4943540"," Okay, so Amazon earnings estimate is at $3.99. Joe's saying, anybody know what the earnings"
"4943540","4947680"," estimates were on average in the 2020-20-20-2021?"
"4948720","4949240"," 2021?"
"4955650","4957690"," Okay, so Henry, what are you saying?"
"4957950","4960970"," Tesla was hitting new high after I was asking you to give us a Tesla."
"4968120","4969940"," I do have some concerns this morning."
"4970440","4972940"," There's a question about what do I think Amazon's going to do to that?"
"4972960","4973440"," It's a good question. "
"4974140","4975380"," I do have some issues."
"4977640","4978880"," Amazon's down 200 points."
"4979240","4982540"," It's almost like they priced in a bad earning, right?"
"4983340","4984700"," Look at this perspective. "
"4986080","4988560"," We traded down 134 points on Amazon."
"4989360","4992680"," It gives anyone with shorts on Amazon the opportunity to get out of them."
"4993680","4994120"," Banks. "
"4994480","4996540"," I'm talking about banks here, right?"
"4997940","5001820"," You saw a bid in Facebook this morning so the market wouldn't burn."
"5002520","5003220"," That's more banks."
"5006000","5011400"," Let's say you've got a big bank like GS or you've got JPM when they're like here. "
"5011540","5013520"," We can't sell the entire market down right now."
"5013580","5014280"," We can't let it crash."
"5015480","5020400"," What we'll do is we'll dump Amazon down a couple hundred points, take our money and run. "
"5021280","5022060"," We'll prop up Facebook."
"5023060","5026660"," We know that the expectations for Amazon are low as fuck, right?"
"5027180","5029680"," We've already shitcanned a bunch of other companies out there."
"5031240","5037800"," If they hit nothing great, we just won't sell the market. "
"5038540","5040940"," We'll actually raise Amazon's price up tomorrow."
"5041220","5045180"," Buy will load it up on Thursday without anybody expecting it."
"5047760","5049600"," We'll move all our propositions and we'll trade higher. "
"5050080","5050720"," That wouldn't shock me."
"5051380","5053340"," There is mass manipulation of the stock market."
"5053340","5054120"," We know that, right?"
"5059600","5060840"," That wouldn't shock me either. "
"5062940","5064600"," Nothing in this market shocks me."
"5066160","5070710"," I used to have hair down your waist, Brad."
"5071170","5072890"," I used to ride a horse naked at the same time. "
"5077140","5078320"," Oh, hey, you guys don't want to wear a hat?"
"5078600","5078820"," Hold on."
"5078860","5079580"," I'll put a hat on right now."
"5145300","5146200"," How's that for a hat?"
"5150630","5151330"," Does that work better?"
"5155370","5159630"," I'm going to now call V for Verizon for the rest of eternity. "
"5160150","5163730"," Just to piss off, uh, just to piss off Winky."
"5170080","5171780"," What do I think about Verizon today?"
"5172480","5172720"," I don't know."
"5172900","5175380"," Let's see what's going on with the options market this morning. "
"5183180","5186040"," Watching some Fed puts, not Fed Ford."
"5186040","5193240"," Oh, Fed puts, Ford puts, day traders trading all the indexes."
"5195700","5197620"," Looks like lots of hedging going on right now. "
"5197740","5198540"," Lots of hedging on IWM."
"5200040","5200620"," Negative."
"5203340","5204160"," Hold on here. "
"5221080","5225320"," Looks like some call hedging on spy for Friday."
"5228340","5230060"," Put hedging on IWM."
"5233060","5234240"," It's interesting to see that. "
"5235220","5235940"," The difference."
"5237460","5238180"," That's rotational."
"5242660","5243880"," Still lots of calls on Tesla. "
"5244420","5245040"," We can look at Tesla."
"5246360","5247020"," Look there next."
"5248400","5250020"," My thought is it's going to get pinned today. "
"5250880","5252460"," I'm going to go with what Spock Emma is saying."
"5252640","5255020"," As a matter of fact, that's basically my same."
"5257240","5259180"," Thought process and where we are in the market. "
"5262200","5265340"," And move my, uh, my mic around this morning here."
"5269640","5300700"," Ten minutes"
"5300700","5303140"," now, ten minutes from the European cash equity close."
"5303500","5305140"," The back's down one and a third percent. "
"5305260","5306420"," The cat gone down one point."
"5306560","5307860"," We pulled up 11 at one spot."
"5307860","5309080"," Three seven percent. "
"5309260","5311800"," The German 10 year yield up 14 on the day."
"5319540","5321900"," Some nasty sellers coming in right now in the market."
"5324080","5325520"," V is heading up right now. "
"5325560","5326840"," Someone was asking me a V earlier."
"5337280","5344800"," Resistance still at 4.56.87. And we watched some sellers head down here just prior to it, 11.15"
"5344800","5345060"," hour."
"5355500","5356280"," That's a little better. "
"5360260","5362020"," Yeah, V says ripping higher at this moment."
"5362920","5363880"," We'll get Tesla right now."
"5364760","5364940"," Tesla. "
"5365800","5366100"," Tesla."
"5372340","5376970"," Tesla Tesla."
"5381550","5382750"," Let's see what's going on with Tesla. "
"5383530","5385710"," What do I think about the market right now?"
"5387430","5388530"," I think I'm holding."
"5391030","5393210"," I've still got those calls from."
"5393690","5394410"," I had some. "
"5397490","5405310"," I've got some February 4th."
"5408980","5409460"," Here."
"5410300","5411940"," I'm going to check from brokerages. "
"5412220","5416320"," I've got some February 4th for 65 C's."
"5416660","5417700"," I doubt those print."
"5418840","5420040"," Highly doubt those print. "
"5420880","5422540"," I think about those right at the bell."
"5422740","5427440"," I got coerced into it by some of my followers here on YouTube."
"5429480","5433200"," At the belly yesterday, but I'm loaded to the tips I'm put. "
"5433520","5435720"," So I didn't care if I bought these."
"5435720","5438380"," And they're not going to impact my position."
"5439660","5442460"," I doubt we go to 465, but I'm going to hold on to them. "
"5442720","5448200"," I've lost almost all their value."
"5448600","5450400"," I think they're originally 39 cents."
"5450660","5452260"," They're now worth four cents. "
"5452960","5453740"," So I'll just hold them."
"5454260","5455760"," I'll hold them till they burn."
"5458160","5460840"," I don't make a decision on a trade for myself. "
"5461240","5463620"," I'm not probably not going to trade until right."
"5463620","5466900"," I'm going to look for what the market says throughout the day."
"5467880","5472000"," And see if this is just propping the market up. "
"5472700","5473460"," Or if I hedge."
"5473700","5477240"," I don't think I need to hedge further on Amazon."
"5478680","5479940"," But I'm pretty well. "
"5481860","5482820"," I'm fairly."
"5483800","5484880"," I look for here."
"5488240","5489580"," I'm fairly well. "
"5491560","5498570"," The US Senate Judiciary Committee approves App Store Bill targeting Apple and Google."
"5500730","5501850"," Heads up on that guys."
"5506160","5507820"," I'm going to read that to you if there's any news. "
"5517170","5518550"," It doesn't say anything about it."
"5518790","5523790"," All it says is Senate Judiciary Committee said to have approved App Store Bill targeting Apple and"
"5523790","5523930"," Google."
"5525130","5526130"," It's up on that one. "
"5549510","5550690"," I'm going to look at Sam."
"5552170","5553070"," S-A-N."
"5559930","5560410"," Wow. "
"5560650","5561530"," Sam's printing, huh?"
"5585290","5585770"," Okay."
"5585810","5586290"," Let's get Tesla."
"5587250","5587950"," Your Tesla's doing. "
"5594040","5603690"," I don't like that Mike"
"5603690","5604210"," Wertzat."
"5604590","5605990"," I still don't like my Mike Wertzat."
"5611220","5612440"," Can't see anything on the screen. "
"5613160","5615680"," Okay, so we've got some resistance above on Tesla."
"5615920","5617760"," 935, 940, 950."
"5619860","5622280"," This doesn't look like it's just propping the market up right now. "
"5623040","5623760"," We'll look below."
"5624000","5625000"," See if there's any support below."
"5641260","5643160"," There's all the support that was at 900. "
"5643720","5650280"," It's now trying to break above this 935, 939, 45, 950."
"5650460","5651420"," Heavy sellers above though."
"5653640","5654660"," Your support. "
"5655020","5656740"," Your intraday support is at 923."
"5657380","5661420"," But if there's anything that comes into the market today, you'd expect us to trade down no less"
"5661420","5662880"," than 881."
"5669260","5671200"," We'll look for real support is. "
"5674040","5675400"," That's some pretty weak support."
"5675740","5682640"," Looks like the support though moved up to 850 is your real support on Tesla right now."
"5684100","5686100"," If you were to trade higher on Tesla. "
"5689570","5692550"," If you're able to trade above this, you always know what we say, right?"
"5692730","5695370"," We trade up to this point to a resistance point."
"5695510","5698750"," We take our money and we wait for a break higher right now."
"5698750","5700290"," It's a break higher of 952. "
"5701150","5702550"," So I feel like I'm super bullish."
"5702730","5703630"," Super bullish on Tesla."
"5705530","5707050"," You get back in again. "
"5707830","5709690"," Sell get back in again on Tesla."
"5709690","5712010"," And you take a two."
"5712670","5713070"," Let's look. "
"5718710","5724490"," I'm not really a fan of holding at major resistance levels for the grind through unless you hold"
"5724490","5727070"," your calls that are way outside the money or excuse me."
"5727070","5728170"," Time to far far away."
"5728610","5729090"," A month out. "
"5729470","5729970"," Three months out."
"5730870","5732230"," Or you're in some kind of call spread."
"5735750","5739570"," This is where the market makers make their money is in these in these volatility zones. "
"5740530","5741350"," You take all your money."
"5743450","5745250"," Or they take, you know, a lot of your profit."
"5747190","5748370"," See here, this 950. "
"5749970","5751550"," Major resistance major solos."
"5751690","5753490"," Next target of above is 1000 though."
"5775560","5776540"," Look here, Tesla. "
"5777940","5779860"," That solos here at 935, 940."
"5781280","5782300"," Next price target is 950."
"5783160","5783440"," Hey, Princess. "
"5813230","5813890"," Oh, yeah."
"5815350","5818750"," Got a new cup of coffee."
"5821370","5822090"," Nice little French. "
"5822230","5824150"," Now that European cash equity close."
"5825270","5828830"," This would be finishing down about one and a half percent."
"5829330","5831810"," The cat car on down one and a half percent or so as well. "
"5834320","5834760"," Yeah."
"5834800","5835840"," So eight eight is your support."
"5836520","5838660"," Your intraday view up is support as well. "
"5838780","5840160"," If you want to trade that, you could trade nine."
"5840280","5841080"," Nine twenty five."
"5841500","5841840"," Right. "
"5842000","5842660"," We're at right now."
"5843540","5845740"," And then possibly slightly lower from it."
"5845740","5847520"," We call it the cat. "
"5847680","5851520"," The half back on this is nine oh eight seventy seven."
"5852280","5854420"," Might find some more support at nine twenty."
"5855960","5857500"," If you're trading V you up. "
"5858100","5860220"," You trade as low as nine twenty to pick it back up again."
"5860440","5863840"," But you do have a major resistance above here at nine thirty five nine forty."
"5864320","5865220"," And also nine fifty. "
"5886050","5888950"," We're going to get sand real quick and then we'll look at SBI."
"5893830","5894810"," Four fifty right."
"5895090","5895590"," She's nice. "
"5895830","5897050"," Support down here for fifty."
"5898470","5900130"," Just trade the bounds on spy."
"5900390","5900970"," If you're trading spy. "
"5904490","5905350"," Right for fifty."
"5905450","5905850"," Trade it up."
"5906150","5907510"," We can go as high as. "
"5909250","5909930"," Roughly right now."
"5909990","5910570"," It's not that high."
"5910710","5911330"," It's a matter of fact. "
"5911650","5912090"," You know it'd be great."
"5912250","5913370"," Every condor."
"5913870","5914930"," Condor and then I don't know. "
"5915050","5917010"," You're not going to get paid on it because you're still waiting on."
"5918370","5919370"," You're still waiting on."
"5923690","5924190"," Amazon. "
"5926550","5927670"," I have a feeling."
"5928470","5931050"," From the way for what happened this morning."
"5931930","5933430"," And you know it rubs me the wrong way. "
"5933790","5937470"," It rubs me the wrong way that Amazon sold off almost two hundred points."
"5938310","5942490"," It rubs me the wrong way that they bought the Facebook bottom this morning."
"5942750","5944290"," Not so much to raise it up. "
"5944850","5946210"," But to hold the market up."
"5947110","5951170"," Same thing with Tesla."
"5951170","5953270"," This is all looking to me like. "
"5954350","5956570"," It would be you know it'd be shocking to me."
"5956570","5957230"," It wouldn't be shocking."
"5957810","5960610"," It would piss me off if you saw Amazon just barely beat. "
"5961470","5963730"," It would make me just beat let's say."
"5964390","5965630"," But nothing extraordinary."
"5966450","5969270"," Where other companies have beat yet sold off even with the guidance. "
"5970010","5971430"," Eight week bills draw."
"5971430","5974130"," The cover three."
"5977650","5983190"," Zero point one four zero percent four week bills draw zero point zero three five percent with fifty"
"5983190","5984650"," one point seven six for a lot of that. "
"5986550","5989510"," So I do want to see how the rest of the day plays out with calls."
"5993060","5996780"," We'll get Sam next and then we'll look at what's the other one you guys want to look at."
"5997820","5998760"," There's another ticker. "
"5999500","6000140"," We'll get Sam."
"6000960","6002020"," We can usually get some pretty good."
"6003240","6005520"," Some pretty good stock picks out there. "
"6005860","6007560"," There's a good stock picker on this channel."
"6007900","6010020"," Winky does a really good job at picking stocks."
"6012160","6013560"," We'll get Sam next for him. "
"6025690","6026950"," This one's savage."
"6029250","6031670"," Four buyers and sellers on sand."
"6035940","6038040"," You could really manipulate this one huh. "
"6041620","6043140"," You can easily manipulate the stock."
"6045420","6047200"," It looks like a pumping dump or stock to me."
"6047700","6048060"," No offense. "
"6049040","6050120"," Just because it's a little liquidity."
"6058780","6059740"," I feel you winky."
"6066900","6068940"," So I was missing some of you guys are saying here. "
"6069060","6070020"," So we'll scroll back up again."
"6075690","6076130"," Look at."
"6088700","6090120"," Yeah, I don't know winky on. "
"6090120","6094960"," If it be honest with you, winky, whoever's talk telling you to buy a sand."
"6098120","6103710"," It looks like a pump or stock easily manipulated."
"6104150","6105510"," I don't know what the float is on it. "
"6106170","6108630"," I don't know what the shorting is on it."
"6109410","6110430"," They come in to be manipulated."
"6110430","6118410"," It looks like from the book map without doing any due diligence. "
"6122790","6127110"," Does anyone here feel that PayPal is a business or is a future of another business that you're big?"
"6127370","6127730"," No clue."
"6128970","6130030"," Yeah, no clue in the process."
"6130350","6130650"," Tesla. "
"6132950","6134750"," I think he's like, but I am in the stock."
"6137250","6142110"," Ten years quietly building a flag comes from the head of the FAA saying it remains encouraged by"
"6142110","6144690"," the ongoing talks with five G providers."
"6145870","6147230"," Speaking on Capitol Hill. "
"6150110","6156310"," I was open to I was open to the Fed not raising rates if certain things were happening and they"
"6156310","6161910"," were happening, but it's not a good sign this morning seeing other nations raising their rates is"
"6161910","6162270"," not."
"6162730","6164650"," It's not good for us not raising rates."
"6165430","6171090"," It's a catalyst for the U.S. Further catalyst for the U.S. to raise rates. "
"6176350","6177570"," No, Tesla looks like me."
"6177670","6179070"," I'm not going to comment on Tesla right now."
"6182490","6183510"," Thanks for rolling over. "
"6183950","6186290"," Yeah, I'm not really strong in Tesla."
"6186410","6188090"," I don't know about that."
"6189890","6191170"," I think it's a trap for bulls. "
"6191410","6192230"," I think you get trapped today."
"6192750","6193170"," Make money."
"6193390","6194650"," You buy the bottom on the open. "
"6195290","6197390"," Make money, but you get trapped at some point today."
"6199610","6202130"," If you look at XB, it seems dead still."
"6202310","6203370"," And next time between six faster. "
"6205910","6206770"," Yeah, I'll let you up."
"6206950","6208190"," Your pay market did just close."
"6209510","6209910"," Yeah. "
"6210010","6211410"," XB is not going up anytime soon."
"6212090","6212930"," I agree with that."
"6213250","6214910"," You really want to look at the. "
"6215190","6217230"," The airport and XPI."
"6219470","6221030"," I don't think XPI shows up well."
"6225880","6227680"," On book map, I could be wrong on that. "
"6230460","6231220"," We'll look at it."
"6232780","6235260"," We have more more resistance here."
"6235560","6237500"," 452 tightening of the range. "
"6237680","6239600"," You can squeeze up here on the spy real quick."
"6240420","6241140"," You guys are wondering."
"6243000","6244280"," It's going to get faster here. "
"6251680","6253860"," I think I'm right above the spy right here."
"6253900","6254840"," We could trade a higher to."
"6257600","6258120"," 456. "
"6264460","6267180"," 450 right now, though, to 451 88."
"6284660","6286340"," Oh, you guys heard we say call it Princess."
"6286400","6287240"," I didn't know you heard that. "
"6287620","6288480"," That I was on mute."
"6289160","6291220"," That was my daughter brought me some coffee."
"6291760","6294400"," Look at Amazon. "
"6294980","6295920"," E.M. on taste works."
"6295940","6296980"," The Amazon is increasing today."
"6297360","6297500"," Okay. "
"6297700","6299060"," Take a look at the Amazon right now."
"6299460","6305530"," A lot of call ideas for Amazon."
"6305730","6305770"," Yeah. "
"6305870","6306470"," We can take a look at that."
"6307270","6308170"," Facebook is still dropping."
"6308350","6308370"," Yes. "
"6308890","6311790"," Not good that Facebook dropped below for our 250."
"6312830","6316430"," It's a negative catalyst for Facebook."
"6317490","6319830"," So they're going to try to hold it up as long as they can. "
"6319950","6320690"," And they're doing it some more."
"6321190","6322810"," There's some Facebook calls coming in right now."
"6323890","6326790"," 38 March 18, 275 C for $200,000. "
"6326990","6329630"," Facebook 3 March 4, 260 C."
"6330470","6336170"," 315,000 Facebook February 25, 260 C for $235,000."
"6337330","6339970"," I think there's some major manipulation going on the market right now."
"6340650","6344130"," At this moment, the banks are manipulating the market right now. "
"6344530","6344970"," Intentionally."
"6345370","6346530"," Which they should, to an extent."
"6353320","6354740"," Look at the XBI just now. "
"6358640","6360180"," Waiting up there unless they move."
"6360520","6361220"," Turns out."
"6361920","6363460"," We just crashed the market today. "
"6363600","6364540"," I want to buy tech stocks again."
"6365120","6366000"," Yeah, that's my feeling too."
"6367320","6368360"," That's my ultimate feeling. "
"6368840","6370760"," I've got some real problems too with the market."
"6370960","6374120"," I've got problems with bulls wanting to buy dips still."
"6374120","6377420"," I really want to see bulls be like, I'm not buying this dip. "
"6377600","6380840"," I want to see CNBC say this is not the dip to buy."
"6381720","6388060"," Not hearing those things makes me believe just on years of trading that we haven't seen bottom yet."
"6391900","6392880"," I shouldn't say that. "
"6394760","6396000"," I got to do some work over here."
"6396100","6397420"," Give me like two minutes."
"6398720","6406460"," I'm going to have some stuff I got to set up over here. "
"6408920","6410860"," You can see the spies being pinned right now."
"6414000","6415480"," Facebook's kind of getting pinned right now."
"6418700","6419880"," Tesla's just kind of hanging out. "
"6425200","6427540"," Give me just a minute here because I want to do some active trading today."
"6430620","6434120"," I'm reading another room right now."
"6434300","6439740"," I think a lot of people are buying those Facebook calls. "
"6439740","6440360"," This morning."
"6443660","6449520"," I don't think people were realizing that those Facebook calls had the intent behind those calls had"
"6449520","6456880"," nothing to do with the actual price of Facebook going up."
"6458980","6466360"," More than likely a bank with a huge position somewhere else in the market trying to protect that"
"6466360","6469720"," position with 10 million in calls to hold it up. "
"6470620","6473160"," Millions more than likely somewhere else in the market."
"6475200","6483300"," If I think just from experience the market looks heavily manipulated today"
"6483300","6486220"," awaiting Amazon."
"6497940","6500020"," It's concerning on both sides. "
"6500820","6506040"," It's concerning that they could manipulate just the reaction to the Amazon ER today."
"6507740","6509040"," You can just take profit."
"6509220","6511460"," Take profit off the 200 points that Amazon is down. "
"6513460","6515900"," Amazon's showing a triple bottom right now as a matter of fact."
"6521170","6524650"," This does look like a set up to burn bears."
"6526530","6528730"," If Amazon hadn't sold down as much. "
"6530790","6534870"," I don't know if I mean it's going to probably take me the rest of the data work this out"
"6534870","6537170"," my mind, but I don't like."
"6538430","6541530"," I mean, like in my mind, I'm like expecting Amazon to sell down yesterday."
"6543070","6546210"," Off of what Facebook did, of course, but then. "
"6547550","6550730"," I'm expecting, of course, Amazon stockholders."
"6550730","6556910"," The US press and New York Times reporting that the US has some intel on Russia that they're"
"6556910","6560130"," planning for a fake pretext of an invasion."
"6561110","6563490"," Ukraine is echoing some reports. "
"6563770","6571000"," We've seen recently a pressure report here out of New York Times on Ukraine and Russia."
"6583010","6591110"," There's certainly some going on without a doubt."
"6591110","6592930"," They took the money and ran on Amazon. "
"6593690","6599530"," They're going to hold the market up artificially due to long positions that a large bank is taking"
"6599530","6599930"," profit."
"6600710","6604790"," We're going to trade it up regardless of what the earnings report is."
"6606590","6609970"," This is when the news is bullshit and it doesn't mean anything. "
"6610710","6613550"," Or it doesn't hold to Amazon this time."
"6617140","6618480"," Or that note that the."
"6621680","6623600"," That the guy was just talking about about Ukraine. "
"6624720","6626540"," That is something that would hurt the market."
"6626540","6628440"," So we could be setting up on the downside as well."
"6628760","6632540"," But there's something definitely going on this morning in the market that's bigger than us. "
"6633520","6635120"," Without a doubt, very unusual."
"6645080","6646320"," And you're going to look at the Amazon."
"6646320","6647440"," Oh, you're trying to look at the Amazon. "
"6649140","6650580"," Let's look at the Amazon."
"6653180","6654100"," Option chain."
"6658670","6661710"," He was Emerson that said to look at the Amazon option chain. "
"6673860","6674460"," Wow."
"6675640","6677600"," There are still some heavy puts."
"6678040","6678460"," Jesus. "
"6679640","6680240"," Sorry."
"6680360","6681340"," I shouldn't said that word."
"6685680","6691160"," There are some nasty put structures on Amazon right now. "
"6693160","6693980"," Nasty."
"6695240","6702460"," Like nasty."
"6703560","6705020"," Who is that that posted that about?"
"6705620","6707800"," Is that Emerson that posted about?"
"6721060","6724240"," Some nasty puts on Amazon today. "
"6732750","6733890"," Yeah, I mean, you get."
"6735770","6740190"," There's someone holding 8,000 calls at 3000 C."
"6742150","6743030"," On Amazon."
"6751220","6752520"," Hold on one second here. "
"6752720","6753140"," Right back."
"6757690","6764010"," For liquid trading in Paris, they're going to be building in the United States, the largest bio"
"6764010","6766730"," methane production unit in the world."
"6767430","6768870"," Alpha India trading in Paris. "
"6789960","6792940"," So there's some nasty put stuff on Amazon too."
"6793220","6794660"," Like some real nasty ones."
"6798410","6799630"," But they've printed heavy. "
"6799810","6802090"," The put put side is printed quite heavily."
"6802450","6804210"," So it looks like everyone's loaded up now on puts."
"6805810","6807110"," Oh, no, they're all gone again. "
"6808410","6811090"," Just some active trading in Amazon right now."
"6826550","6829130"," So a whole bunch of puts were just closed on Amazon."
"6829130","6830950"," Just last two minutes. "
"6832910","6833810"," That's different levels."
"6834590","6835370"," Very low levels."
"6838550","6840930"," Maybe another buy the dip opportunity in Amazon coming up. "
"6870870","6872490"," Hey, what's going on brother?"
"6873990","6875770"," So I was just good to see you."
"6876130","6880090"," So I was just looking at Amazon options chain."
"6880310","6881530"," There was a shit ton of puts. "
"6881530","6885130"," And they just disappeared."
"6885650","6887130"," I don't know if that's spoofing going on."
"6887510","6890430"," Or it's just some proper real quick profit taking. "
"6890830","6893170"," A triple bottom looks like on Amazon."
"6893870","6897930"," Then there's someone loaded up on 8,000 contracts on long on Amazon."
"6903130","6905830"," Someone said they wanted me to bring a bat, bring back the hats today. "
"6905950","6906670"," So I put a hat on."
"6907390","6909750"," One of my goofy ski hats."
"6909750","6911510"," I got tons of hats, actually. "
"6911930","6913630"," My daughters have a ton of hats, I should say."
"6915350","6917210"," Yeah, that's my painted tin foil hat."
"6919710","6922230"," So reportedly, so that's stuff on Russia. "
"6922450","6923490"," Let me read that stuff to you."
"6924210","6925330"," I'm going to get this."
"6928390","6934590"," Reportedly, the United States has intelligence on Russia detailing a plan to fake a pretext for an"
"6934590","6935510"," invasion on Ukraine. "
"6936810","6941090"," The U.S. officials believe Russia is preparing a false flag operation in eastern Ukraine."
"6941310","6943690"," An effort to create a pretext for an invasion."
"6944190","6950050"," Where Russia has prepositioned a group of operatives to create an incident in eastern Ukraine that"
"6950050","6952150"," would give Russia an excuse to invade. "
"6958330","6962730"," And you've also got to follow up the Ukraine presidential advisor."
"6962730","6968550"," Your Mac time, your Mac is saying that's time for an honest conversation about NATO."
"6969290","6971270"," Ukraine is ready and able to become a member. "
"6971530","6972930"," That's pretty big news right there."
"6974390","6982230"," Even just a handshake deal to become a NATO member for Ukraine automatically means that NATO will"
"6982230","6982870"," come to your aid."
"6983390","6984050"," But you know what?"
"6984270","6985190"," I'll be honest about that. "
"6985430","6989430"," It's probably better if they weren't a member of NATO in some context."
"6990330","6992650"," NATO is usually slow to respond."
"6994350","6996110"," Even the UN is slow to respond. "
"6996590","7001910"," You really do want like just the U.S. or England responding as a nation."
"7009450","7011930"," Yeah, the implied volatility must be crazy on Amazon."
"7012590","7014470"," So we'll talk about that again, right?"
"7014930","7018630"," Yeah, I don't even put they're just rolling in right now by the truckload. "
"7025180","7027320"," Yeah, my hat is ridiculous."
"7032560","7036300"," Yeah, I don't even should be drills a lot of foot flow coming in and out of UN right now."
"7039640","7044780"," Is there a way to just monitor volume on specific strikes or sell by like when the volume flips?"
"7045340","7045840"," Yeah, I'm winky. "
"7046020","7046840"," So you know what I tend to do?"
"7048480","7053660"," Is if I'm trading, if I'm looking at, well, this is what I used to do before I was live"
"7053660","7053920"," streaming."
"7054140","7058640"," What I would do is if I'm focused on one particular ticker, I'll just open up the options to chain"
"7058640","7063680"," on it and just start watching it, watching it, watching it, watching it, all day long."
"7064420","7065500"," And then at some point make an entry. "
"7073090","7074330"," I do not believe U.S. intelligence."
"7074490","7075290"," I agree with that."
"7075430","7075890"," I was in the military. "
"7077070","7078110"," I don't believe U.S. intelligence."
"7085360","7093460"," Yeah, it looks like the mirror looks like the someone from Ukraine is saying that they want to join"
"7093460","7093940"," the UN."
"7095940","7097860"," I'm listening a lot of what you guys are talking about. "
"7102600","7103300"," Pumping sand."
"7111560","7113260"," That could come to great yesterday."
"7113520","7113740"," I agree. "
"7118010","7119810"," I'm listening a bunch of what you guys are saying right now."
"7120050","7125570"," I'm having some weird stuff going on with my chat box this morning."
"7127330","7145380"," I'm listening"
"7145380","7146500"," a bunch of what you guys are saying here. "
"7149500","7152500"," I'm trying to scroll through the chat box and it's like jumping."
"7153420","7157480"," So I'm missing a whole bunch of what you guys are talking about."
"7159020","7163380"," So I'm just out of the end now. "
"7168360","7169060"," It's just creeping."
"7169360","7172940"," Well, I can't have a book map and options to chain the lives for you and us to watch you"
"7172940","7173960"," like these two alone."
"7177280","7179200"," That kind of looks like it's on a cliff. "
"7180260","7181240"," Change to join NATO."
"7181460","7182960"," Young people had enough to travel to Ukraine."
"7185700","7187900"," Ukraine is very much like the United States. "
"7192600","7196980"," Does it make sense to set strikes for spreads in between resistance and support levels?"
"7198000","7200100"," You know, it depends on your strategy."
"7200360","7202580"," Sometimes I just buy, you know, it's weird."
"7202900","7210360"," There's a conversation about spreads that could take hours to talk about and when to apply them,"
"7210480","7211620"," when to buy them, when to sell them. "
"7213760","7216560"," With the spread time."
"7220600","7222740"," Turn on the timestamp on my chat box."
"7223420","7224140"," How do I do that?"
"7226920","7233740"," Can I do that inside of the alert box?"
"7233740","7234840"," You can talk about the alert box. "
"7235200","7236560"," I mean, the right click on the alert box."
"7240980","7242360"," I'm probably going to fuck this up."
"7244220","7245000"," Is it in the filters?"
"7245860","7246340"," Edit filters?"
"7246660","7247880"," Let me see if I can do this while it's running. "
"7248580","7251340"," Watch me fuck up the entire stream right here."
"7257400","7259600"," I'll look into that."
"7259800","7261280"," I don't know that I can do that right now. "
"7262820","7275620"," I like"
"7275620","7275800"," that."
"7282410","7282810"," Yeah."
"7282950","7284210"," So that's how the money puts. "
"7284230","7284770"," I like that."
"7285010","7285930"," I like what I'm saying."
"7287630","7288450"," See three dots. "
"7288710","7289310"," I'm looking right now."
"7289870","7290150"," Three dots."
"7291650","7292170"," Click the hamburger. "
"7293990","7295710"," Ooh, toggles time stamps."
"7296750","7297090"," Nice."
"7299010","7301730"," I just clicked it. "
"7302570","7303570"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"7304270","7305030"," Oh, yeah."
"7308930","7309610"," Who did that?"
"7309730","7312150"," Who was that that said that about toggles time stamps up there?"
"7312910","7313710"," Thank you, Matthew. "
"7319980","7321720"," You, you, you creators now like the USA."
"7322900","7340350"," Yeah, thanks"
"7340350","7340950"," for the three dots."
"7346190","7346590"," Yeah. "
"7346690","7347310"," Thank you very much."
"7353860","7355740"," I don't want to say a mirror."
"7355860","7359680"," I don't want to say what I want to say about about Ukraine being like the USA. "
"7360480","7361160"," I kept it."
"7361320","7362460"," I tried to short it out."
"7363200","7364660"," Hey, figure you out money. "
"7365020","7365700"," How's it going, brother?"
"7366400","7367160"," Good to see you."
"7368200","7369220"," I follow you."
"7370480","7371920"," I love your content, brother. "
"7374140","7376240"," By the way, I pump you up on Twitter."
"7379220","7380840"," I love your content, man."
"7382360","7383280"," I love your content. "
"7387180","7388000"," Figure you out money."
"7388200","7389500"," What do you think is going on out there?"
"7390160","7391560"," It's kind of wild right now, isn't it?"
"7392340","7393940"," We were talking about it this morning."
"7394780","7396240"," I'm interested to get your take on it. "
"7397980","7401660"," I was talking about the moves overnight from Facebook."
"7402940","7403780"," Of course, right?"
"7403900","7404780"," Everybody's talking about that."
"7407620","7414520"," And I'm interested to see what your take is because I think there's a, there's some big banks work"
"7414520","7421580"," in the market this morning watching that bid on Facebook looks more like to prop the market up the"
"7421580","7422580"," waiting Amazon. "
"7424740","7425960"," You got short term."
"7426280","7427380"," Well, you get that happening, right?"
"7427560","7429660"," So you can't break for 50 this morning."
"7432480","7434400"," Can't break for 50 this morning. "
"7434540","7440280"," So they prop up the market, prop up Facebook, prop up spy."
"7440280","7441840"," Of course, it's selling IWM."
"7443320","7447340"," It looks like, it looks like almost like they're, are we dumping soon?"
"7447560","7448060"," Are you still there?"
"7448580","7450420"," Wait a minute. "
"7450620","7451280"," Go back up here."
"7451800","7453460"," Is figuring out money still here?"
"7454920","7455780"," Guys, awesome."
"7457000","7458360"," That is great work on YouTube. "
"7458600","7462040"," If you guys don't follow him on YouTube, follow figuring out money."
"7464180","7467840"," You have MU put golden sweeps coming in May 20th."
"7468680","7470860"," 1.3 million dollars. "
"7472340","7473560"," AMD calls."
"7474220","7475820"," April 14th."
"7475980","7478840"," 115 C 1.9 million dollars. "
"7480640","7483940"," That's a good expansion of calls on AMD."
"7484540","7486520"," Positive for AMD over time."
"7487080","7488720"," You're looking for that kind of call expansion. "
"7491000","7492260"," He is still here."
"7492560","7494060"," It's odd figuring out money."
"7494060","7495140"," My question to you is. "
"7496060","7498440"," There is a hole in the cube profile of my park below that."
"7498640","7499580"," We'll hold a yes by."
"7499880","7501620"," Yes, my my concern today. "
"7501940","7503420"," Figure out money is."
"7504840","7507320"," They make in the week, right?"
"7507520","7509660"," They make Google walk the plank."
"7511200","7512940"," They we all know what they did. "
"7513440","7515700"," Pumps the market up and then you've got a Facebook miss."
"7516140","7518940"," We walked the plank with Facebook yesterday with a Facebook miss."
"7519240","7520340"," Of course we dump. "
"7521260","7522520"," Right at that 460 mark."
"7522520","7523920"," Everybody knows that that's the."
"7525300","7527880"," The negative downward channel resistance point, right?"
"7528020","7530420"," At that point, we've got sellers hiding above. "
"7530420","7531720"," They got caught in the four fifth."
"7531720","7533280"," We dumped below 450 on the spot."
"7534320","7536780"," And so you get, you know, sellers hiding up there. "
"7536800","7538360"," You've also got buyers down at 420."
"7539440","7542560"," They want to protect with that and that negative impact."
"7542660","7545080"," Short term puts for protection being bought. "
"7546120","7548120"," All dated for today and Friday."
"7548120","7551260"," All that gamma rolls off between today and Friday."
"7551920","7554020"," But not today and Friday, but Friday specifically. "
"7554520","7556620"," If Amazon reports decent earnings."
"7557320","7560660"," But what my interest is in is that Amazon sold off 200 points overnight."
"7561260","7562860"," Into today, let's say roughly right. "
"7563840","7566720"," Sold off 208 points now at this point."
"7567880","7570500"," But if you were a big bank, you're propping up the market for the."
"7571000","7574600"," For the Amazon announcement, they are in the guidance today. "
"7575360","7577260"," What's interesting is you could take your profit from Amazon."
"7578600","7581120"," From a short from Amazon short, just today."
"7582240","7583500"," You prop the market up. "
"7585340","7587580"," Amazon's expectations are lower than they've ever been."
"7588600","7589980"," Just sub four dollars."
"7590860","7593040"," Maybe they just barely beat. "
"7593740","7594960"," And the market rises."
"7599630","7602050"," All that put hedging comes off for Friday."
"7602710","7604110"," And then we snap way higher. "
"7605950","7611380"," You guys follow him?"
"7611620","7611840"," Awesome."
"7612380","7613720"," You should follow figuring out money."
"7619040","7621740"," We are watching Amazon dip right now. "
"7621740","7624100"," I want to give you a market warning right now."
"7626560","7628980"," There's a market warning of pay attention to Amazon."
"7630260","7640150"," By $27.96.50. And you're"
"7640150","7642090"," seeing it as well on the spy currently. "
"7643370","7649350"," Test down below at $4.50. Once again, we know that there is some manipulation in the market this"
"7649350","7649550"," morning."
"7649750","7653610"," So you want to be conscious, be a paying attention to see if banks do step in."
"7654170","7656350"," You try to prop this market up at this point. "
"7657630","7661490"," Set a pin strike at $2.791.69 on Amazon."
"7664390","7667650"," I do want to warn you out there that if $4.50 breaks."
"7668430","7672130"," And if we have any kind of a cascading effect and put flow. "
"7673190","7675110"," Options flow into the market at this point."
"7675870","7677550"," It could be very dangerous, right?"
"7678230","7679910"," We're talking much, much lower."
"7694410","7699710"," 119.6 million euro versus 103.9 million year ago. "
"7700130","7702890"," I don't think that it sells off, but I would be concerned here, right?"
"7703050","7705190"," You're looking for a target below."
"7705190","7705850"," I believe it was."
"7705970","7711250"," They were calling for $4.35 on SG this morning. "
"7712070","7720890"," It's like there's light support here, $4.47. So your target below would be somewhere around $4.35."
"7722430","7731550"," And it would open the door to testing a lower low down around $4.15. A dangerous"
"7731550","7736570"," moment for the market where we are, especially in terms of time."
"7776080","7777380"," Same thing for Facebook."
"7781950","7791870"," We also know that Apple, or excuse me, Tesla has no support down to $8.80. The market is on"
"7791870","7793890"," the knife's edge currently at this moment. "
"7806650","7809250"," Critical support for the market across the board."
"7809930","7813970"," We showed you earlier the, I'm not going to bring up XBI."
"7816990","7823970"," But I was talking to you earlier about the real support on Tesla being at $8.80. There is a"
"7823970","7827170"," possibility that you'll trade slightly lower than the VWAP on Tesla this morning. "
"7827670","7833590"," Trade slightly lower down to that $9.20. We've just broken through here at $9.18.65. We slightly"
"7833590","7835390"," blow the intraday VWAP."
"7837590","7841970"," If that fails to hold, you are looking for a steep sell-off on Tesla."
"7843210","7857580"," XBI is now breaking below $500, excuse me, $4.50. Amazon"
"7857580","7876570"," now down $2.22.21. Not"
"7876570","7879850"," a good place for XBI currently. "
"7881210","7887010"," Fighting to maintain $4.50. Next target below."
"7887690","7888830"," We are below VWAP currently."
"7888830","7898790"," Next target below is $4.47.50. Yes, sir,"
"7898910","7899010"," Cody. "
"7899210","7901450"," We did just violate $4.50 on spot gamma."
"7902790","7905130"," Also, I made a note on Twitter this morning about that."
"7905590","7907650"," I think I had like three o'clock in the morning or two o'clock in the morning. "
"7907650","7915010"," You do not want to break $4.50 and hold below $4.50. If you turn support into resistance there,"
"7915470","7920910"," the target below, no less said."
"7920910","7924150"," They call it $4.35. It's slightly lower than that."
"7924590","7934470"," It actually opens the door to a retest of lower lows that's deeper than $4.20. If we don't"
"7934470","7940070"," trade higher, let's say we're at $4.50, we don't trade higher to $4.65, right?"
"7940270","7947350"," For another test down below to close to $4.20. There are some Elliott waivers out there claiming"
"7947350","7952790"," that the door would be open to somewhere between $3.90 and $3.60. I don't know that I've tested"
"7952790","7955450"," that right now, but there is concern. "
"7968860","7970840"," This is definitely a concern here."
"7986480","7987880"," Watching some put flow right now."
"7987900","7991640"," I don't know if I want to highlight it too much because these are day traders. "
"7991920","7994580"," This is not my bank movements currently at the moment."
"7994760","8002240"," There are some puts coming in."
"8002240","8005520"," February 4th, $4.45, $64,000. "
"8005800","8009680"," Lucid and video snap jets is of note."
"8010800","8019730"," June 17th, 21.86 p for $164,000."
"8020610","8029590"," Spy, February 4th, 445 p for $139,000, but not millions in flow. "
"8031850","8033910"," This would be the moment that you would see it."
"8034110","8036590"," If you see there's two things that could go on."
"8036670","8039750"," You could see a cascading of put flow and hedge flow. "
"8041010","8044310"," Some of it could just be selling of puts to bears."
"8044990","8048190"," Some of it could actually be trying to roll the market over at this point."
"8054890","8057350"," But we're not seeing either of that right now at this moment. "
"8068110","8070230"," We'll take a look at Tesla next and see if it can hold."
"8070230","8072830"," Looks like the market's trying to fight itself back."
"8085770","8087770"," Who's saying that Roblox is halted?"
"8093080","8095980"," We're still talking about Roblox being halted. "
"8096820","8097900"," Did it actually halter?"
"8098140","8099340"," No, it shouldn't halt."
"8100140","8101220"," We're going to really run with this."
"8101400","8104120"," We're going to say that Joe Rogan, our rest in peace Joe Rogan. "
"8114410","8125840"," Spy crawling its way back, trying to maintain that $4.50. Would"
"8125840","8131880"," not surprise me to see us trade down to this $4.47.50. To slowly trade down."
"8133980","8137960"," Sometimes you'll see us trade down to lower levels as support kicks in."
"8138400","8139860"," But $4.50 should be maintained. "
"8140500","8143020"," It's critical that $4.50 is maintained in the market."
"8151340","8159740"," Yeah, there's a whole thing on Reddit and YouTube about the sketchy petal thing."
"8159740","8163180"," I guess that wasn't being addressed by Roblox. "
"8164600","8170840"," And then I think Sony had to step in or something and start to police their discords."
"8174720","8178120"," Of note, just now we have Snap."
"8179820","8183520"," January 20th, $30C, $1.4 million. "
"8187340","8189460"," Watching some put flow on queues."
"8191660","8193240"," And Spy queues."
"8194200","8197760"," We have got February 4th, $3.55P, $170,000. "
"8198480","8204360"," And Spy puts February 4th, $4.50P, $262,000."
"8205920","8207920"," Some light spy calls come through."
"8215889","8218410"," We'll look at Tesla real quick and see if it holds below. "
"8218610","8221690"," This could just be day traders trading the VWAP."
"8229150","8232030"," Here are indicators not as high as it was."
"8232809","8235870"," More sellers currently on Tesla. "
"8237670","8240650"," Remember that the swings in Tesla could be violent."
"8241690","8245629"," $8.80 to $9.30. Pretty violent for Tesla."
"8263889","8265049"," It's a nice note there. "
"8265209","8269690"," Al Marino is saying that Spotify opened by trading on the New York Stock Exchange."
"8270090","8275709"," That's initial price was published to the market pre-trading was $132 per share."
"8276410","8277750"," The opening price was at $165. "
"8282600","8285660"," Yeah, if you're day trading, Tesla, right?"
"8285799","8287000"," You see your VWAP is up here."
"8287980","8294780"," $9.27 or so we're currently trading at $9.14. Real support on Tesla is a wide range."
"8295500","8306920"," $8.80 to $9.35, $9.50. With some reasonable sellers sitting here at $9.30. So"
"8306920","8309100"," you can sell the ranges here, right?"
"8309700","8316400"," Sell $9.35, pick up at $8.80. Or if you're going to trade it with some intraday support levels. "
"8317180","8327160"," You had $9.15.38. $9.05.91. And probably back down $8 "
"8327160","8360090",".80. Put"
"8360090","8360969"," puts coming in."
"8362330","8363629"," We'll look at hood next."
"8376059","8391720"," I want"
"8391720","8392380"," to see if this. "
"8396200","8403820"," If this white eyes down below at that $4.47. If it starts to firm up down here, it starts"
"8403820","8406020"," to see more buyers accumulate lower."
"8406660","8408520"," Sometimes it can act as."
"8410280","8411280"," See this right here?"
"8411320","8415100"," See this white back here and it turns into yellow and red. "
"8415740","8422380"," Even though we're trading higher right now, the more buyers that show up down here at $4.47.50. We"
"8422380","8425080"," sometimes have a tendency to be attracted to those buyers."
"8425860","8427860"," It has to do with a dome."
"8428040","8434620"," It has to do with buyers at different levels trying to match them up to sellers. "
"8435380","8442480"," They'll lower the price down to $4.47. So let's look for a target down below at $4.47.50"
"8442480","8443240"," if you want to take along."
"8443540","8444740"," Or I might take along there."
"8445920","8452340"," I would be willing to take along at $4.47.50. I'm going to let up hood right now. "
"8454080","8455740"," It's been a great day trading by the way."
"8457560","8460100"," The Kramer say that hood was going higher than $15."
"8461220","8462520"," So what Kramer said. "
"8463200","8464860"," I wonder if Kramer actually trades hood."
"8470890","8473450"," He just throws random shit against the wall in hopes of $6."
"8486200","8488700"," Pretty reasonable issue to support on hood here. "
"8494060","8496600"," I know the real buyers are somewhere down sub 10, right?"
"8496600","8497400"," Somewhere down here."
"8497920","8500220"," $9.82. At least temporarily."
"8501700","8507960"," We know that the rough supports $9.00. It was a great buy at $4.00 a.m. the other"
"8507960","8508200"," day. "
"8509560","8512700"," We will look lower down below and see."
"8519380","8520420"," There is some concern."
"8520660","8521480"," This $3 mark. "
"8522360","8524700"," This $2.73 mark is of note."
"8525420","8527840"," Prior we had the support roughly."
"8527840","8528500"," We had some. "
"8528780","8538470"," This support right here was at like $5.65.80. I have some concerns with hood"
"8538470","8542750"," looking for expansion of their market with crypto currencies."
"8543510","8546450"," I think in the car market it can be a negative for hood."
"8547030","8548930"," I would not stop going to see us. "
"8549330","8550690"," This is the real trading range."
"8550870","8558350"," It was at like $5.00 and $12.00. Now for day trading it's like $10.00, right?"
"8558490","8559670"," Like $9.80 something like that."
"8560110","8568210"," I think I have a $9.80 solid of $15.00. And that really buying into the support being at"
"8568210","8571650"," $15.00. Then we're trading higher to $20.00 as of yet. "
"8573270","8578870"," And I didn't think we'd get as low as $5.60 before their guidance."
"8579870","8583310"," But after reviewing their guidance, I think it does trade lower."
"8584170","8585790"," Currently changed my viewpoint. "
"8586010","8595290"," I thought that the bottom on it was somewhere between $6.00 and $10.00. I don't like their crypto"
"8595290","8595630"," expansion."
"8595850","8599870"," I'm looking more for a revamp of their trading platform."
"8600630","8603190"," Even if it was to mimic something basic like Webull. "
"8604010","8607350"," For charting like just something more for people to grow into."
"8610070","8613110"," And possibly replacing of Vlad."
"8614470","8615530"," It's weird too. "
"8615670","8616050"," You can eat."
"8616610","8618750"," This could easily be done even without replacing Vlad."
"8620570","8622990"," Just a refresh of their image. "
"8625170","8634390"," And then better tools or growing new traders, new investors from the video game aspect"
"8634390","8639150"," of a Robinhood to Hey, Will introduce you and keep you."
"8639350","8642850"," That's the other part is the retention of users."
"8643730","8645850"," You figure you're a new trader, new investor. "
"8646130","8647530"," Let's say they start with Robinhood."
"8648550","8651190"," If they don't know anything right, let's say they start with Robinhood."
"8651570","8653190"," Then they graduate like a Webull. "
"8653950","8659210"," And then they go on to graduate from a Webull to the next step in their career."
"8659550","8662950"," They go to Tasty or they go to Ninja or whoever."
"8663110","8663670"," It doesn't matter. "
"8664190","8665030"," Take a swim."
"8665750","8666430"," What have you?"
"8666790","8670570"," And not only do they want to bring in new people in, but they want to retain those new people"
"8670570","8672490"," in their trading platform."
"8673650","8678770"," They have the golden key in all honesty in new investors and traders. "
"8679030","8683990"," So I'm still left scratching my head on Robinhood, not having some kind of a platform like that."
"8684330","8685690"," Where you grow with the platform, right?"
"8685810","8692830"," You start off with this Robinhood basic and then you move up to your next version of the platform."
"8694590","8706860"," So until"
"8706860","8712420"," I hear something like that about Robinhood, I don't know how it trades higher than 14 bucks. "
"8712600","8716340"," I think it trades between 10 and 14."
"8718020","8718940"," 10 and 14."
"8719080","8723780"," And then if there's if there's not a good guidance, their next quarterly report, I think we can"
"8723780","8726460"," easily begin a trade lower, lower ranges. "
"8728520","8731960"," And that bottom support was at six bucks prior to that year."
"8732560","8737100"," It was at five or six bucks, not down at three dollars, which is of concern as well."
"8737780","8739000"," That a bank knows more than we do. "
"8745540","8746780"," Not financial advice."
"8771330","8773230"," That wall of sellers above on the spot."
"8773850","8774390"," Just waiting. "
"8777960","8779660"," Yes, I wonder if we get set up today."
"8780760","8781680"," That's still in my mind."
"8781680","8782940"," I think there might be a setup here. "
"8787400","8792220"," I'm interested in taking an interesting and taking the opposite side of the trade."
"8793100","8795080"," Into the close today on the market."
"8796640","8803140"," I'm interested in buying some outside the money calls on the market into four PM today. "
"8805280","8807900"," Loading up with some with some real money down."
"8818660","8823860"," And video puts $800,000 March 18 to 40 P."
"8824320","8827300"," I don't even just keeps racking up puts this morning."
"8827980","8829500"," I am February 25. "
"8831760","8833340"," 177,190 P."
"8833940","8835120"," I don't even want 90 P."
"8835340","8839700"," Excuse me, just three of them sweeps spread or spread it around, spread around trying"
"8839700","8846620"," to hide it."
"8852740","8855660"," I don't even want to see what's going on with it."
"8857420","8859240"," It's been bleeding all day, right?"
"8863240","8879330"," Looks like"
"8879330","8882130"," buyers have stepped up on the spy. "
"8882850","8885790"," They moved up from 447 49."
"8891750","8897290"," Tesla is now traded down to its intraday SMA 200 SMA on the one minute chart."
"8897890","8899370"," Just tagged at 910. "
"8900810","8903890"," Looks like everybody knows that support's really down at 880."
"8906910","8908870"," Someone saying Tesla was bullish earlier."
"8911190","8912210"," I'm at 935. "
"8918280","8920840"," Stan looks like it's selling off slightly here."
"8928350","8929690"," Facebook's still doing the creep."
"8935060","8937320"," I think there's a trade here on the long side. "
"8938420","8939780"," I smell the banks."
"8940320","8941520"," I can smell them."
"8943760","8946520"," I can smell them in the background right now. "
"8949260","8954460"," This is outside of any kind of fundamental technical."
"8955140","8959600"," Any kind of analysis other than the movements in the market currently this morning."
"8962900","8967020"," I'm already loaded to the tits and inputs, threads. "
"8968120","8969880"," So I got loads of protection on."
"8970480","8971720"," I've got like three condoms on."
"8972000","8972600"," I'm all lubed up. "
"8975060","8976360"," I got some burning."
"8977000","8978040"," Some burning."
"8979780","8982560"," OTM calls already on the spy for Friday. "
"8983120","8989680"," But with that being said, man, I get the sneaky suspense."
"8989920","8995040"," I mean, I realized that the market is is protected right now."
"8996040","8999120"," But if if Amazon, you know, that's the thing. "
"8999120","9009060"," I want to preface this with one important statement that you have to look at the"
"9009060","9011880"," perspective of do the banks want to sell the market right now?"
"9013380","9016180"," Do the banks ultimately want to sell this market today?"
"9017780","9026020"," Because if they do and they hold Amazon to every other big tech company and what the reaction has"
"9026020","9027900"," been pretty consistently, right?"
"9028340","9029920"," You have to have really good ER."
"9030200","9031280"," You have to have really good guidance."
"9031660","9035800"," And you probably have to have something that nobody knows about, right?"
"9035940","9038240"," Like a stock split, i.e. Google. "
"9041260","9042860"," But do they this time?"
"9043380","9047100"," This is when you hear people come on the internet and they go, why did it matter this time?"
"9047180","9049220"," Why did the news matter differently this time?"
"9049820","9053060"," This is when the banks say we're not dumping it."
"9053060","9057540"," And so everybody's just loaded."
"9057880","9059900"," We do this like during the Fed meetings. "
"9059900","9061380"," We do this during Fed minutes."
"9062760","9069720"," You look at everybody knows everybody knows everybody knows everybody knows everybody knows."
"9075120","9078820"," And then we swing it the other way. "
"9078820","9087480"," I can't guarantee that's what's happening today, but it's starting to like smell and act and walk,"
"9088000","9090280"," talk, like a duck."
"9097230","9100210"," It's starting to, oh someone just added to run, woohoo."
"9101610","9103070"," Hey, figure out money. "
"9103930","9105710"," Thank you for being here this morning."
"9108990","9113450"," I'd love to have you on sometime, if I could."
"9113750","9119370"," If it's anyway possible, I could reach out to you and have you talk to our people. "
"9128550","9132750"," Or if we're at a key pivot in the markets, come on board and let's talk."
"9132750","9135550"," Because we talk, we talk, we talk the market."
"9136470","9140370"," Almost like, almost like we're at the racetrack or something. "
"9145960","9147700"," Thank you for stopping in this morning."
"9150480","9157100"," Catching a nice bit in the spy, tagged down below at 449.15. Maintaining at this moment."
"9160300","9162640"," But thank you for your money, appreciate you stopping in. "
"9163180","9166680"," I'm going to post a link to you today on Twitter."
"9168940","9172360"," And I'll put something down in the discord for you too, brother."
"9172920","9173940"," I appreciate you stopping in. "
"9189050","9191250"," Make sure you guys are following, figuring out money."
"9191370","9196010"," He's got a great YouTube channel, puts out a market analysis every night."
"9197190","9199250"," He's got a cute little dog, I think. "
"9199950","9202350"," I almost remember he had a cute little dog."
"9203010","9206250"," But he puts out a great program every single night, five nights a week."
"9207030","9209590"," Usually does something on Sundays as well. "
"9210190","9212310"," He's one of the guys that I trust on YouTube."
"9213270","9216490"," And he's got a presence on Twitter as well."
"9220300","9221240"," Check him out. "
"9223700","9230100"," He does a great job with finding out which sectors are we rotating into."
"9231360","9232900"," There's a keen eye for it."
"9248960","9250560"," Good to have it even checked today. "
"9251960","9254980"," Have it even checked XLU, XLPL, the usual suspects."
"9260840","9261760"," Consumer staples."
"9262640","9264320"," That consumer staples just ripping. "
"9267720","9269380"," Because XLV doing today."
"9273450","9275310"," Holding on, XLV is holding on."
"9276850","9278390"," XLP though, green in the day. "
"9280430","9282190"," Just pinged higher at $77."
"9283150","9290810"," From a low of $76.35. And going up for three straight sessions."
"9311990","9314610"," So I might take this contrary and trade into the bell today. "
"9316250","9322390"," I just don't want to get chewed up from now into three or four o'clock."
"9322590","9324090"," I want to see if they show their cards here."
"9330210","9335270"," Let me know in the chat if you think that this market is going to go up. "
"9337130","9340690"," Or if this market is going to sell off into the close."
"9341630","9345910"," Do you think that there'll be some manipulation in the earnings report and guidance of Amazon?"
"9348650","9350230"," A whole bunch of questions for you."
"9369780","9371900"," Is not clear or is choppy. "
"9382920","9385760"," Tell you about SPY 460C27."
"9386140","9386740"," A whole report here."
"9386860","9387840"," The Spanish primary report. "
"9387920","9391800"," The rejecting labor reform required for access to EU recovery funds."
"9395820","9396940"," I like what Eric's saying."
"9397200","9398820"," Sell off into close mega green tomorrow. "
"9399180","9404860"," We did see a report earlier that the Prime Minister Sanchez did have the votes for potential labor"
"9404860","9405300"," reform."
"9405540","9406300"," Figuring out money."
"9407240","9408560"," His name is figuring out money. "
"9410280","9412620"," Or is his YouTube name."
"9413820","9461020"," Let me"
"9461020","9462180"," see what his Twitter is."
"9468060","9469220"," Tashiva 6205. "
"9469980","9471220"," Yeah, just at Mike P Silva."
"9471640","9474140"," They're going to be doubling their power chip production."
"9474660","9476100"," So at Mike P Silva. "
"9476340","9477140"," On Twitter."
"9477720","9478300"," 6502."
"9479260","9480320"," At Mike. "
"9480540","9480820"," In Japan."
"9481720","9482740"," Mike P Silva."
"9483140","9483380"," On Twitter. "
"9483640","9484160"," Find him there."
"9520490","9530740"," Just saying that probably say we'll trade down to 448 or 448.5. Yeah."
"9530820","9531360"," Michael De Silva. "
"9534380","9536220"," We have the Twitter."
"9537020","9538060"," That was Twitter run."
"9539100","9540560"," I think I follow him on Twitter. "
"9541540","9542940"," Almost positive I follow him on Twitter."
"9544300","9545180"," I love his content."
"9593420","9596180"," I didn't I didn't just fashion and smash in here. "
"9632760","9634020"," More puts on spy."
"9634540","9636020"," February 4, 450 P."
"9636320","9638420"," $345,000."
"9641260","9643600"," WDC January 20, 50 P."
"9644040","9645120"," $434,000. "
"9645360","9647060"," Spy February 4, 450 P."
"9647060","9649000"," $197,000."
"9662560","9668280"," I don't know has lots of buyers, but their hero cumulative indicator is brutal right now."
"9684980","9686900"," You guys want to see Pete on real quick?"
"9696270","9701310"," Mike, my big question for Peloton is just how do you survive your earnings report?"
"9708120","9715260"," You know, it reminds me of specifically a Facebook and their guidance yesterday. "
"9715260","9718100"," They held the big meta thing, right?"
"9718240","9722480"," They had this big meta thing or a product release."
"9722500","9726320"," You call it right where they're talking about meta and how they're going to change the world."
"9726960","9735500"," It's a play to, of course, lure in new users, younger users, tie into a user base around the world"
"9735500","9741500"," probably targeted mostly at Asian countries that have adopted the metaverse. "
"9743220","9748200"," There are billions of metaverse users in across the world."
"9748460","9751460"," It's not really as big in the U.S. as it is in other countries."
"9751800","9751960"," It is. "
"9752180","9753140"," With our youth it is."
"9754980","9755900"," But it's interesting."
"9756760","9763860"," The point to note on this though is, you know, you've got Mark Zuckerberg who can do this big"
"9763860","9765680"," product launch for the metaverse, right?"
"9767340","9775640"," But we've talked at Nazium about earnings and guidance where CEOs can't lie. "
"9776360","9777160"," They're not supposed to."
"9777840","9782800"," It's one of the golden rules for, it's one of the golden rules for these companies."
"9783980","9789940"," It's the agreement between the market and companies that four times a year you're going to be"
"9789940","9792440"," truthful about your business practices. "
"9793400","9794860"," And Facebook was honest, right?"
"9795140","9801500"," We're seeing less users, no new users, young users aren't using Facebook."
"9802320","9805600"," And so that's my question for Peton in their earnings report."
"9806380","9812060"," They can say whatever they want publicly on news releases, on fluff pieces. "
"9813060","9818280"," But when you put the rubber to the, I don't know what you call it, the rubber to the street"
"9818280","9822980"," or something or the curb, they have to be honest in their earnings report."
"9824040","9829100"," So even though they're trading at $25, so you do a wipe off in this distribution, you sell it down"
"9829100","9831480"," slowly at the price that you want to get out."
"9832280","9839680"," But the real thing for me is that when you get into their earnings and guidance, you want to hear"
"9839680","9842760"," something more than I have a strap from my arm, my upper arm. "
"9842760","9851180"," You know, I want to hear something like we partnered with a bike manufacturer, like outside bike"
"9851180","9851960"," manufacturer."
"9852620","9857600"," We partnered with a ski company, something, anything that's other than stay at home."
"9858980","9860380"," And how do you adjust to that?"
"9861220","9866660"," And I don't know that they did that work while we were under lockdowns, right?"
"9866960","9870680"," Did they do the actual work to grow their company, expand their company?"
"9871280","9876760"," Or is it all focused on being a bike manufacturer, basically, into our bike. "
"9876920","9879640"," Which is fine if they're going to be that company."
"9879880","9885000"," If they don't have plans to expand outside of a home exercise or exercising at home."
"9885940","9894200"," But I don't think it trades at $25 if that's what you are. "
"9895100","9896620"," Then you trade somewhere lower."
"9896820","9902840"," You trade somewhere between 10, 15 and 20 if that's what you are."
"9903340","9909080"," But if you're going to expand your business and want to trade at a higher multiple and be"
"9909080","9915400"," considered a growth company, the expectation I think would be that you're expanding your products"
"9915400","9917220"," to include not just stay at home. "
"9918580","9920500"," I think it's critical to piton success."
"9922220","9923740"," And an arm band doesn't do it."
"9930760","9933800"," I mentioned a YouTube channel and options influencing stock price. "
"9935040","9936060"," Can you tell that again?"
"9936300","9936940"," Yeah, I have that somewhere."
"9937120","9937960"," I think I posted that somewhere."
"9939820","9941360"," But I don't know what off top of my head. "
"9946760","9952200"," So I'm S-ray saying the premium is going up on both sides on Amazon today like I've never seen."
"9953760","9955360"," Remember to the road, that's what it is."
"9955440","9959780"," So piton looks like. "
"9959860","9960620"," So you've got some resistance."
"9961260","9961860"," Light support here."
"9961960","9962600"," Big support here. "
"9963100","9963900"," The 2520."
"9964160","9965400"," Next stop below the open breaks."
"9965700","9969060"," The hopes to reach the deal on U.S. government funding very soon. "
"9971320","9974400"," Next stop below on redo in here."
"9974980","9981080"," General Motors, new union in Mexico plans to ask for raises above inflation off Michael."
"9981080","9983680"," Next stop below on piton though. "
"9983880","9985480"," If this support breaks, it's $23."
"9986600","9989380"," You do have resistance above at $26."
"9991660","9993100"," You guys want to look at Facebook next?"
"9995920","9996980"," I'll do that for you, John. "
"10015640","10018540"," AMD with more calls coming in February 18th."
"10018980","10019840"," Keep an eye on AMD."
"10020200","10020960"," Lots of call flow. "
"10022080","10023420"," More call flow 318."
"10027780","10029160"," Facebook call flow."
"10029440","10029980"," Hello, ladies. "
"10030720","10032880"," AMD March 18th."
"10033080","10034680"," Another million dollars."
"10035180","10036900"," March 18th, 125 C and MD. "
"10037180","10039300"," Facebook with excellent."
"10039820","10040760"," You want to see this, okay?"
"10041260","10044520"," Facebook June 17th, 220 C."
"10045640","10048400"," 18.3 million dollars."
"10049080","10052660"," 18.3 million dollars on Facebook 220 C."
"10053240","10054200"," Nice move. "
"10055100","10058400"," February, excuse me, spy puts February 4th."
"10058820","10065240"," 450 P for $280,000 QQQs puts February 4th, 355 P."
"10066260","10069800"," That's actually for a million dollars split between two and two sweeps."
"10070660","10071900"," So a million bucks against the cues. "
"10072720","10076020"," Small bit in GDX put more puts."
"10079210","10081730"," You do want to see that call expansion."
"10081730","10085110"," It is deep in the money on Facebook. "
"10085690","10087250"," That's a nice bid at 10 million."
"10087590","10092510"," There could be something going on here in the market where this is a bear trap."
"10094150","10095030"," Getting into the close today. "
"10102630","10107750"," Major support currently on Facebook at 240."
"10108690","10110210"," Let's look a little slightly lower here."
"10126710","10129350"," Big buyers down below at 235. "
"10131130","10134310"," Look even deeper to even get real ugly."
"10136790","10137750"," So 235."
"10138510","10143110"," If you're going to follow those calls, my recommendation is wait for a tag of 4235. "
"10145790","10147070"," Not so much this 240."
"10147450","10148610"," Let's look slightly lower."
"10149550","10150410"," If you can see it. "
"10151270","10152510"," But we can see it a better."
"10155270","10156950"," Somewhere down in here, 235."
"10158730","10159270"," 240. "
"10171070","10177130"," So I'm going to guess this morning that this is a setup."
"10182350","10183470"," Against the bears."
"10198480","10200220"," It's currently 1242. "
"10206080","10209260"," Facebook sellers move from 245 to 246."
"10209260","10210520"," Now released up to 248."
"10220630","10221290"," Yeah, I'm waiting. "
"10221570","10223210"," I'm just going to buy my time here."
"10223390","10226030"," I don't want to get burned on."
"10226910","10228670"," So we know that this pretty decent support. "
"10229330","10231270"," If you want to follow those calls on Facebook."
"10233030","10236390"," If we can get a quick dip down at 235 possibly in some weakness."
"10237030","10240130"," Some volatility maybe heading into the close today. "
"10240790","10241930"," Not that it's going to happen."
"10242070","10246070"," But for me, if I was going to take along on Facebook currently, I'd be looking for that dip down"
"10246070","10247810"," below 235 possibly."
"10247810","10249190"," You might not get it though. "
"10251370","10257490"," There should be a lift in Facebook of course due to dealer hedging on that on those calls down"
"10257490","10257790"," below."
"10266170","10269370"," I'm going to take this trade at some point a long trade on the spy."
"10271410","10272430"," You can do it on the queues. "
"10276440","10286100"," I'm going to take a long trade in the spy and hedge my short position, my market short."
"10304150","10305790"," Yeah, I think there's a lot of waiting today."
"10308510","10309510"," I think it's a bear trap. "
"10312510","10317690"," If I have to guess, if I have to take a guess on the market right now currently, that there's"
"10317690","10318990"," a major bear trap setting up."
"10322250","10325070"," But I don't, I think it's a trap for bulls too to some extent."
"10326430","10328070"," No, I think the whole thing's a trap. "
"10328070","10331350"," I think the whole thing's a trap today into end of day."
"10334110","10336490"," So I'll wait until end of day or close to end of day."
"10337710","10347680"," There was one commentator earlier that said, there was one commentator earlier"
"10347680","10350680"," that said we sell off into clothes and then we have a big ripper tomorrow. "
"10351740","10352980"," That could make sense too."
"10353720","10354800"," I've seen that happen before."
"10358700","10360620"," Yeah, so my take on today is this. "
"10361940","10364200"," We got our Amazon sell off yesterday."
"10366360","10367600"," They took it for profit."
"10368120","10369040"," This was banks, right?"
"10369300","10370880"," They propped up the market this morning. "
"10372280","10375820"," Just enough actively propping the market up for end of day."
"10378600","10386240"," I think if Amazon hadn't sold off as hard as it did, you'd probably get some selling on Amazon."
"10390610","10400590"," But I think you're going to see a manipulated response to Amazon versus how other"
"10400590","10401230"," companies report. "
"10402210","10402650"," Maybe not."
"10402810","10403470"," We could trade down."
"10405770","10414910"," When we tagged this morning, 2716 on Amazon, the deepest I saw Amazon selling to was"
"10414910","10416510"," 2488. "
"10423170","10424050"," Maybe 2269."
"10424650","10426510"," Maybe that's the buy-in they're looking for."
"10428350","10429390"," It is a white-off. "
"10429550","10433570"," I mean, it is showing itself as a white-off, right, as we're a white-off pattern on Amazon."
"10434310","10442630"," On the long term, going back to August of 2020, it would be the last piece of the puzzle."
"10443190","10443910"," I will say this, right?"
"10444010","10445250"," This is the last thing I'll say on this topic. "
"10446410","10447890"," As a bull, right?"
"10449310","10451890"," I am unwilling to buy Tesla."
"10452710","10458670"," I am unwilling to buy Amazon until they come back to more reasonable levels."
"10459190","10465810"," If there was a day to do it, to bring back all of these big tech names, today is the"
"10465810","10466010"," day. "
"10466270","10467270"," That's the bear case, right?"
"10467970","10472850"," Today, this week, next week, you take them to a level where everyone wants to buy them."
"10474890","10481930"," Everyone will want to buy Amazon at $2,500, or even lower, just like you saw the buy-in on"
"10481930","10482690"," Facebook today."
"10485090","10494470"," The bear case would be that we do a really fast sell the market, get it down nice and deep"
"10494470","10497450"," on big tech names that are holding up all these ETFs. "
"10498750","10500210"," Soop in, grab them."
"10508210","10510270"," Buy your summer calls right now on Facebook."
"10511430","10516830"," Buy your summer calls on Amazon in a day, possibly even Tesla and Apple could fall with them. "
"10517570","10520150"," Because big tech is done with their earnings, right?"
"10521950","10527470"," Beat down IWM at the same time so you can grab a cheap price on IWM for mid-cap and"
"10527470","10532870"," small-cap ERs, like a symphony orchestra into the close."
"10536230","10542510"," You can prop the market up, dump it real quick into the close, grab what you needed to grab, and"
"10542510","10543290"," then we're off and running."
"10545130","10547930"," It would be so fast, it would take place over the course of a day or two. "
"10549970","10553170"," Watching heavy spy calls coming right now, heavy."
"10554150","10556970"," A couple million dollars spread around, all sweeps."
"10556970","10564970"," Spy, 440P, $882,000 for February 11th. "
"10565230","10571650"," Spy, 440P, $564,000, February 11th."
"10572230","10575770"," Yup, spy, February 7th, 450P, $400,000."
"10576050","10579890"," Spy, 11th, 440P, $395,000. "
"10580590","10583870"," Spy, 11th, 440P for $214,000."
"10584710","10587770"," The bear case today would be, we sell it down."
"10589250","10590870"," QQQQ's, 350P, February 11th. "
"10591390","10592890"," Major put flow coming in right now."
"10593170","10594090"," Heads up out there."
"10598110","10600810"," So, yes, the bear case would be, we sell it down finally. "
"10601050","10606970"," We finally knock down Amazon, we finally knock down Facebook, Apple, Tesla, dirt cheap."
"10607750","10608870"," Then we start driving on from there."
"10610670","10620560"," Yeah, Facebook's breaking through 240 right now, 239. "
"10621310","10623700"," 235 looks like major support for it currently."
"10626320","10628220"," We'll see what the reaction is down below."
"10630720","10631880"," But it could be quick. "
"10632120","10637080"," It could be something where, my point to you is that, I've got some calls coming in and ask QQQ,"
"10637420","10640480"," $156,000, February 11th, 38C."
"10642740","10647560"," XOP, February 11th, 108C for $367,000."
"10647560","10650040"," High algo score, try energy. "
"10651400","10656060"," So, like the bear case would be, we sell these big tech names down to a reasonable price."
"10656480","10657020"," We make it fast."
"10657580","10659320"," We dump IWM really fast. "
"10661400","10670680"," We've got some major IWM puts, golden ticket, February 25th, 190P, $1.5 million."
"10675940","10680260"," And then you get all these banks that are able to buy in for summertime."
"10681640","10683740"," It happened so fast, you wouldn't even see it, right?"
"10683840","10685500"," If you were a bull, you wouldn't grab it in time. "
"10687700","10691680"," Now, on the flip side of all this would be the bear case for end of day, and that would"
"10691680","10695180"," be that the market's being propped up."
"10696140","10700780"," We head into the close today, and they just disregard."
"10705030","10706530"," Amazon earnings and guidance. "
"10707890","10716130"," If they hit, you know, if they do an okay guidance and they have an okay, they're just positive."
"10716630","10717530"," They're just beating."
"10719110","10727710"," Now, the third case is, or the fourth alternative is that everyone's long from 420, and they've got"
"10727710","10735330"," put protection on, short protection on, it's temporary into Friday, and they don't care what, you"
"10735330","10739490"," know, they don't care if the earnings are good or bad, or the guidance is good or bad on Amazon,"
"10739590","10741230"," that they're protected. "
"10742030","10744710"," So that if we have to sell this market, they don't care."
"10744990","10748530"," They're going to get paid, and they'll just lift them off and take longs on the fly."
"10749610","10757250"," So all that action should take place unless something leaks between 4.45 and 5 p.m. Let's find out"
"10757250","10759450"," what time Amazon actually reports today. "
"10760370","10763610"," Do we get the actual numbers at the bell or is it later?"
"10782270","10786410"," It says after market close, but I'm not seeing an actual time."
"10789530","10793550"," But it could be a great play between 4 and 4.15 on the indexes."
"10802920","10804560"," This is interesting too, right?"
"10804740","10810300"," So the EPS forecast for the quarter is $3.88. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was"
"10810300","10821160"," $14.09. The consensus"
"10821160","10830720"," forecast in September, September 2021, was reported in October 28, right, was $9.99 "
"10830720","10841100",".10. The earnings per share was 6.12. It was a surprise, a negative 32.75%. This"
"10841100","10842660"," is a crucial one o'clock hour in New York. "
"10844020","10849920"," Equity indices are hovering near than was the S&P and 1.7%, but as that compounds it down, 2 "
"10849920","10858180",".7%. And they missed it then."
"10858440","10860100"," So the EPS forecast is very low."
"10860660","10861900"," It wouldn't need much to beat. "
"10863480","10864480"," They hit six."
"10869870","10877490"," So the reporting today would have to be pretty ugly to miss."
"10887110","10891610"," So I think even if we have panic selling into the bell, there could be a rip higher at some"
"10891610","10895190"," point after the bell or tomorrow. "
"10898190","10901950"," Get a face rip in rally next few days."
"10901950","10906410"," And then we sell back down a little bit, right, come down into where all the spreads are for the"
"10906410","10907490"," banks on OPEC's."
"10921940","10923120"," What's the comment?"
"10923320","10923700"," I missed something. "
"10924200","10924560"," What's up?"
"10924800","10925700"," 50% past hour?"
"10926540","10927040"," The dude in orange."
"10927300","10927840"," What are you talking about?"
"10927940","10930120"," I didn't see what you were talking about."
"10932060","10933420"," You know, you're back holding on Facebook. "
"10939330","10941270"," I missed whatever you were talking about above."
"10943410","10944650"," Put your tools away, Josh."
"10945210","10946110"," There's your tool. "
"10947690","10949730"," I missed something I was talking about."
"10954890","10955930"," I think they beat."
"10956330","10960070"," I mean, you figure they beat or they didn't. "
"10960250","10963070"," You know, they were making their expectations so high."
"10963270","10965970"," They're still they're still tagging like six, seven bucks."
"10966570","10971610"," If they're if their expectations are four bucks and let's say they hit six. "
"10972830","10973870"," That's a huge beat."
"10975830","10998450"," If their expectations are lower, you"
"10998450","10999810"," get a huge B with good guidance."
"11001030","11003750"," And if the banks just want a decent price to buy that. "
"11008810","11010170"," Yeah, future sales will be key."
"11010350","11010890"," I agreed, David."
"11013050","11016470"," Maybe you do see some sort of panic move into the bell. "
"11019910","11030920"," Then you can grab a cheap stock price after four p.m. Yeah,"
"11031020","11032820"," pizza and price are currently at $23."
"11034860","11036460"," I'm going to bring up some stuff over here."
"11036460","11036780"," I need a moment. "
"11049320","11050980"," You guys got me wearing this goofy hat."
"11054560","11055860"," You guys are hilarious."
"11057520","11058820"," Put on the goofy hat today. "
"11072460","11073220"," It's an odd day."
"11073380","11074820"," It's going to be a lot of money made today."
"11106600","11110460"," You'll get my charts set up for all of our earnings are going to be reported today. "
"11114820","11116680"," We've got end of day and tomorrow."
"11119160","11121140"," Major earnings for today and tomorrow."
"11124080","11125520"," We've got Amazon. "
"11126080","11126520"," We've got Ford."
"11126780","11127140"," We've got Snap."
"11127480","11127900"," We've got Pinterest. "
"11129000","11130180"," We've got Activision Blizzard."
"11133900","11134720"," Sketchers GoPro."
"11136360","11136960"," Tomorrow. "
"11137900","11138860"," We've got our CL."
"11142520","11143660"," Bristol Mario Squibb."
"11144000","11144600"," I'll bring up you. "
"11144880","11146460"," I'll bring up XPI for you guys."
"11149260","11151740"," I can see why you want to know if XPI can trade higher."
"11157120","11158580"," Let me bring up Ford. "
"11161930","11164630"," I do wonder if Ford impacts Sunrun."
"11164630","11173180"," I want to know."
"11173420","11175000"," I would like to hear a Ford's. "
"11175260","11182480"," I want to hear a Ford's like we've been drinking Budweiser for two years and pissing away all our"
"11182480","11182980"," free money."
"11189320","11191820"," Or do they say we live in SLI."
"11192860","11201140"," Coke Industries defending its investment in SLI after the negative short solar port from India. "
"11225550","11230070"," Coke saying that they believe Standard Lithium's technology is a promising bright spot on the path"
"11230070","11232650"," toward Lithium production in the US."
"11247960","11249420"," ATVI with them up."
"11253880","11256140"," Activision, they've got their stuff going on tonight. "
"11259280","11261000"," They've got them already."
"11261920","11263980"," We're also going to track today at the end of the day."
"11265180","11266100"," We'll do Unity. "
"11276720","11278480"," Yeah, all these companies are..."
"11278480","11280840"," I mean, I want to preface something here, okay?"
"11281540","11286700"," If you look at all of these tech companies that are reporting today, they're all trading lower."
"11287800","11288740"," All of them."
"11289040","11289900"," Ford's trading lower. "
"11290640","11292320"," Like everything is trading lower."
"11299360","11299880"," I smell a trap."
"11314240","11315180"," No, there isn't. "
"11323760","11326320"," Are you telling me that all of these companies are going to have misses today?"
"11327600","11329480"," They're all trading lower today."
"11331060","11332460"," Anything that all of them miss?"
"11333380","11336640"," Or is it going to be that it doesn't matter if they've seen me like QCom, doesn't matter?"
"11337500","11339020"," We're going to dump it anyways because it's tech."
"11339700","11340040"," I guess so. "
"11349070","11351310"," Let's look above and see if we don't miss."
"11353470","11354470"," We trade higher."
"11361450","11362890"," Let's see if we can make some money today. "
"11366280","11367980"," Some snap calls coming in."
"11368560","11370360"," $4.14.25. See?"
"11371140","11372420"," $236,000."
"11373860","11378120"," So $4.57. It's not going to cut the mustard. "
"11385140","11387460"," $4.60. More sellers are coming lower."
"11388340","11389360"," That's an interesting note."
"11389780","11396040"," $4.61. How much are $4.61 costing right now for Friday expiry?"
"11399580","11401040"," That's what I need to keep my eyes on. "
"11404790","11411350"," $4.61 or $4, even probably $4.57. Keep my eye on the price of those today."
"11416000","11416960"," February 4th."
"11417760","11421560"," Everyone's loaded to the tits on the put side of the spy right now. "
"11423180","11424160"," Everyone's in on puts."
"11426240","11433320"," Now $4.61 for only $0.11 on the spy."
"11434300","11435200"," Dirt cheap. "
"11439920","11441600"," Probably going to buy some of those right now."
"11443020","11443800"," Might not even wait."
"11445440","11446620"," We're getting closer. "
"11452290","11454290"," Roblox puts February 4th."
"11454650","11456630"," $59.00. $101,000."
"11456930","11457510"," Looks like a signature. "
"11463280","11465600"," I'm probably going to get myself some calls here."
"11467300","11471060"," So $4.49. We trade to $4.61 by Friday."
"11472280","11473060"," I think so. "
"11486380","11492160"," Yeah, I think I'm already short the market, so I think it's one o'clock in the afternoon."
"11501420","11503280"," I'm going to take a..."
"11505720","11506500"," Let's see."
"11507120","11516510"," This spy. "
"11518290","11521890"," The safer bet is probably taking him for Monday."
"11575310","11576670"," Watching this spy."
"11579490","11582730"," Golden ticket coming in March 18th. "
"11583070","11584370"," $4.29 P."
"11585010","11586430"," $7.8 million."
"11613820","11615560"," So I'm buying a bunch of calls right now."
"11648800","11649200"," Okay. "
"11651860","11661460"," So I'm already starting to load up on the call side on spy."
"11666720","11667860"," I don't like..."
"11667860","11668580"," I don't like..."
"11669920","11671580"," This way I don't like..."
"11676300","11678280"," Well, I can see the March 18th."
"11679080","11684400"," There's some repositioning of hedging from February 18th to March 18th. "
"11684920","11685340"," Okay."
"11687320","11689600"," There's heavy IWM put flow."
"11690780","11692780"," I think the March is being manipulated right now. "
"11692980","11701410"," So everyone is short this market right now at this moment."
"11705500","11706980"," I think Amazon beats."
"11719430","11722590"," Also, my problem is Henry is that I've got..."
"11723930","11724830"," Yeah, there's a roll. "
"11725250","11726190"," They rolled it out to March."
"11728810","11731570"," They rolled from February 18th to March 18th."
"11735910","11737310"," My problem is that I'm loaded. "
"11737970","11738730"," I am loaded."
"11741090","11742690"," Loaded with puts right now."
"11745690","11746970"," So I'm going to make my money. "
"11746970","11749590"," And I've paid for those puts on the right up, so they're free."
"11750150","11752270"," So I've got a bunch of puts that are free that I own."
"11754110","11757110"," Put spreads dated for February 18th. "
"11757110","11759050"," And they're put spreads, so it doesn't matter."
"11760250","11761550"," Like I don't care about IV."
"11761870","11762590"," I don't care about interest. "
"11767990","11768950"," They're all paid for."
"11774390","11775250"," Well, that's my point."
"11775530","11775590"," No. "
"11775870","11779710"," See, I do think it matters, but I don't like that Amazon sold off so much."
"11780810","11785610"," I'm not saying we can't have a sell down either in the after hours and then a buy in the"
"11785610","11785890"," morning."
"11786890","11794410"," I think that's still viable to say we want to see a better price on Amazon and want to see"
"11794410","11797470"," a better price on not so much Facebook anymore. "
"11798130","11802130"," But on Tesla and Apple, we want to see a better price."
"11802850","11804230"," You know, banks are greedy."
"11804550","11807570"," They don't really care about prices as much as they care about where everybody else is so they can"
"11807570","11809110"," go elsewhere with it. "
"11809110","11812690"," So if everybody right now is loaded up on the put side, I'm going to take the contrarian trade."
"11813630","11818430"," Protect my put side from not printing."
"11819110","11823370"," I'm going to take some 11 cent, 12 cent calls on the spy. "
"11823890","11824530"," They're going to expire."
"11824810","11826490"," Now I'm starting a position right now."
"11827870","11832250"," There's a possibility that I'll burn some of the value of those off as we head into the four o "
"11832250","11832590","'clock hour. "
"11832950","11835730"," So what I'll do is I'll just monitor them the rest of the day."
"11836810","11838150"," I'm going to monitor the spy."
"11838730","11840110"," Let's say we start selling off. "
"11840110","11841750"," We sell down into the four o'clock hour."
"11841850","11843070"," Let's say they're worth like five cents."
"11843530","11845410"," I'll add more 461s. "
"11845450","11847610"," I'll add probably some 457s."
"11848010","11853090"," It's official saying that this time there's no plan for a meeting between Biden and Putin."
"11855010","11857490"," I'll add to my position as the day moves forward. "
"11857890","11861450"," I'll grow the position and whether I lose them or win them, I don't care."
"11861530","11863750"," They're only 10 cents, five cents, whatever they're going to cost."
"11870160","11871820"," And I'll work that into the close today. "
"11886600","11888940"," So I think we're back to another split."
"11897790","11898570"," Oh, did he?"
"11898770","11899070"," I don't know."

"12527900","12528820"," Pump this by."
"12533800","12534820"," Sell all those puts."
"12535960","12537160"," Sell everybody out there. "
"12537260","12538140"," Just sell puts to everybody."
"12538380","12539240"," Here's some puts for you."
"12539780","12541080"," Here's some puts for you. "
"12541860","12543580"," Here's some puts for you and IWM."
"12545220","12546400"," Everybody's loaded to the tits."
"12554060","12555760"," Why don't I buy SPX?"
"12557500","12558480"," Typically, I don't trade. "
"12558480","12560420"," I used to trade futures a lot."
"12561660","12563120"," I stopped trading futures."
"12564000","12565220"," So I stopped trading SPX. "
"12567680","12569880"," I don't trade SPX anymore."
"12570080","12570720"," I need no more ES."
"12571700","12574320"," Now I just trade cash market options. "
"12583420","12584200"," This by."
"12584460","12586260"," It's the easiest way for me to make money consistently."
"12593140","12596820"," But most of what we talk about here works for SPX. "
"12598240","12600100"," Not enough liquidity in SPX."
"12600920","12603400"," It would be another answer for why don't trade SPX."
"12609860","12615380"," I used to hold a lot of stock and I would sell and buy calls or sell calls and puts"
"12615380","12615940"," on stock. "
"12616240","12619000"," But I've since de-risked my entire portfolio."
"12619800","12620980"," So now I'm just straight cash."
"12622240","12625560"," This market moves so wildly right now that I can only trade. "
"12626360","12630480"," Or I can only hold positions until a price target is met."
"12631820","12633540"," Or a swing is met, in my view."
"12634520","12637780"," I think we've got too many high frequency trading firms in here. "
"12638260","12640580"," We've got retail with too much information."
"12642720","12647060"," So you're seeing everything being the juice being taken out of everything right now."
"12647480","12653760"," All my old school trading tool or my methods for trading kind of blown out. "
"12654560","12659740"," So I've been reduced to now like having owned stock for since September."
"12660520","12662060"," Oh here and there I bought stock."
"12662280","12666940"," I bought some Robinhood the other day but I held it for like two days I think. "
"12667580","12668900"," Held Robinhood stock for two days."
"12670080","12673740"," I'd like to hold Robinhood stock for three months or six months."
"12676300","12678500"," The way this market trades right now you just can't. "
"12678500","12681020"," So right now for me."
"12682000","12683380"," Making my money from."
"12686300","12686900"," Spreads. "
"12688300","12693740"," Safety and spreads and a combination of that and directional moves on the spy."
"12699840","12701600"," Yeah there's a lot of a lot."
"12701900","12704560"," I don't know if that's put selling an IWM. "
"12705520","12710300"," For like a capitulation down move to buy the bottom for earning season."
"12710300","12713460"," Or if that's just selling to bears."
"12722040","12723260"," Oh look at that huh. "
"12724980","12729600"," All that's all that all those puts on out of your web and here we go snapping higher."
"12732800","12734140"," Oh my calls down."
"12734580","12735800"," Hey I'm making money on calls. "
"12736820","12737360"," Yay."
"12740990","12742390"," Making some money on some calls."
"12752610","12756430"," If we trade it up to four sixty or four fifty seven and be make a lot of money today. "
"12758490","12759390"," If that happens."
"12761230","12763390"," I'm just looking at everything like I'm looking at."
"12765290","12767890"," All of these companies reporting are down today. "
"12769430","12772850"," Every single one of them you tell me that not a single one of them is going to report."
"12774150","12776750"," Great ER and great and have some good good guns."
"12777090","12777670"," None of these companies. "
"12790060","12790460"," Yeah."
"12790580","12791660"," Tech ER is a Russian roulette."
"12791720","12792160"," I agree with that. "
"12799280","12803120"," You can still easy trade earnings plays on companies that trade like cash full like restaurants and"
"12803120","12803500"," we chill stores."
"12803500","12804180"," I agree with that."
"12805500","12806900"," Good morning wizard spell yes. "
"12807920","12808560"," Kind of wild."
"12808700","12810540"," We had a celebrity in here earlier today."
"12812140","12813180"," We had Mike De Silva. "
"12815380","12816140"," That's pretty wild."
"12816140","12818800"," It was really nice having to stop in this morning."
"12827710","12828550"," They're all shit. "
"12833540","12835640"," That's a sweet wrap on eat."
"12838980","12840160"," I'm still holding putts."
"12840300","12842040"," I've been buying puts the whole way up. "
"12843260","12844280"," I haven't sold them."
"12844340","12845060"," I'm not going to sell them."
"12846260","12849280"," They're into I have them for February 18 for OpEx. "
"12849760","12856580"," If I get a sell off due to whatever happens at the end of the day today."
"12857400","12857920"," They'll print."
"12862330","12868190"," If we trade somewhere into OpEx around 440 to 450 I'll print some of them. "
"12868570","12871250"," If we trade any lower they're going to print heavy and big."
"12874430","12876210"," I've got some other crap kicking around."
"12876370","12877430"," I've got like run calls. "
"12878210","12879330"," That's for an ER play."
"12879510","12881790"," I've got some Pete on puts."
"12882790","12888310"," And then I just bought some for my day trading activities for my gambling habit. "
"12890010","12893650"," I'm starting a position on."
"12896150","12897830"," Growing a position on."
"12900470","12901670"," 461 C."
"12903630","12907290"," Expiring tomorrow due to where the resistance levels are. "
"12907590","12908570"," Where the sellers are."
"12909570","12912510"," They're cheap like 10 cents something like that."
"12912990","12914370"," 10, 12 cents each. "
"12916350","12920110"," I'm going to build that position as we head into the final hours today."
"12922450","12923730"," It's very directional though."
"12923870","12929530"," It's something where you're going to be going to be looking for a catalyst for a big move for those"
"12929530","12931090"," to gain some value. "
"12932990","12935490"," And I'll keep adding to that position adding to that position."
"12947560","12949420"," I'm going to look for a big move in the end."
"12949560","12951840"," I'm going to look for a big move directionally today at some point. "
"12952600","12953740"," We're either moving down or moving up."
"12955600","12962500"," We know from Spock Emma this morning that if we do get good earnings call that this market should"
"12962500","12963620"," rip into Friday."
"12966740","12971880"," Just based on the put protection being lifted in the market. "
"12981720","12984060"," The TPR is my next earnings play case."
"12984180","12984980"," He wants to inverse me."
"12998520","13000560"," The Fed still showing up to buy bonds. "
"13002240","13005060"," The day that they stopped showing up by bonds."
"13006880","13007920"," We just look at this."
"13009380","13010780"," You never see this on the spot. "
"13011720","13013080"," Just dead flat."
"13017220","13018440"," There I am right there."
"13018700","13022260"," 4.56 right but I really want to see is above here. "
"13023320","13026180"," If there's good earnings this here would go by buys."
"13027300","13028140"," See you later."
"13034350","13041320"," So you have 4.61s. Come on here. "
"13050520","13055420"," These sellers came down this little bit of ice above here 4.61. You probably want to cut them loose"
"13055420","13057780"," at some point at 4.57 if they do rip."
"13061760","13062740"," Write that down."
"13065880","13071520"," So 4.57. Probably get max gains out of them. "
"13073100","13073820"," If we rip higher."
"13090780","13092120"," Look a key column for you."
"13100780","13101700"," I think it's a setup. "
"13102280","13104560"," A setup one way or the other right."
"13104720","13105700"," We're going to go higher or lower."
"13105900","13106300"," We know that. "
"13107140","13108660"," We know there's a setup in the market."
"13115720","13118120"," We know without a doubt there's a setup going on the market."
"13127880","13131560"," And just a note that we have traded down into. "
"13131560","13139000"," So right just so you guys know like technically speaking at 45 0.88 on the spy."
"13139800","13141880"," We have traded below that number."
"13142780","13148560"," And that puts us into back into the bear flag. "
"13150300","13154240"," That we've been trading channel bear flag that we've been in on the spy."
"13156680","13161280"," Going back all the way to January 21st to the top of that channel."
"13162080","13163500"," We are just below it. "
"13165880","13170320"," Like not hand grades and horseshoes but seriously looking at the where we are."
"13170620","13178540"," So you probably will find some heavy resistance at 450.92. Yeah, 450.92 somewhere in there."
"13179300","13180080"," Some heavy resistance. "
"13180500","13182180"," But if we break above and out of this channel."
"13182940","13185120"," There should be a huge move higher."
"13199750","13201430"," No, so if we rip higher. "
"13202370","13204770"," I still think we come back down for Opex."
"13205090","13208070"," You guys ever watch Opex where we'll trade."
"13208810","13212090"," But you guys always look back on Opexes and you'll see it's really neat. "
"13212290","13215450"," You'll see like let's say we close on Opex at 450."
"13216350","13220790"," You'll see us trade and hit higher 475 and we'll hit lower at 425."
"13221550","13223870"," And then we'll tag 450 right into Opex. "
"13224270","13226290"," They'll park it right where they want it."
"13226810","13231850"," But they'll trade the upper and lower ranges of where they expect it to be on Opexes."
"13231910","13233910"," And that goes for quad-witching specifically too. "
"13236390","13240930"," So when using spreads which the banks often use they wait till they hit their price targets."
"13241850","13243790"," Sell them and then they print out the other side."
"13244890","13246030"," They'll print both sides. "
"13248470","13249670"," They always win."
"13255170","13256750"," You want to see a price target on the queues?"
"13257490","13257990"," We can do that."
"13258210","13259330"," We'll do Qcom real quick. "
"13262470","13264030"," Oh yeah baby, look at Qcom."
"13266050","13268710"," This is a total trader's ticker."
"13269830","13270690"," Slams down on 180. "
"13271170","13272050"," Slams back up to 190."
"13273210","13274770"," Back to the usual suspects with Qcom."
"13277410","13283310"," We could probably spend every day just trading Qcom, couldn't we?"
"13285970","13287310"," We just trade this ticker. "
"13289570","13295650"," Such a great ticker to trade."
"13296730","13298150"," This is a day trader's ticker."
"13298850","13300870"," That firms like that too. "
"13301030","13302310"," Roblox can be kind of like that."
"13306750","13308850"," Now I want you to know right if we break above."
"13311310","13315450"," I think this 450, 86, 450, 92 in the spy. "
"13316290","13317230"," Things to get wild."
"13318310","13318750"," Wild."
"13320390","13328600"," Take a ramp shop. "
"13329020","13330020"," What else are you guys looking for?"
"13330540","13331640"," We're looking for QZX."
"13331800","13333240"," We'll look up Nasdaq real quick."
"13346680","13348220"," We had a really nasty snowstorm here. "
"13348740","13349500"," It's like a sheet of ice."
"13352850","13354510"," Okay, you want to see this break above."
"13355090","13355990"," See this?"
"13355990","13359610"," This is just 451 right here. "
"13359610","13361010"," We can break through this 451."
"13362630","13363390"," Shit is on."
"13370260","13371180"," Shit is on. "
"13376750","13377790"," I think it's still intact."
"13378030","13381730"," I think if we traded higher, we traded up like 46470."
"13381870","13384610"," It wouldn't be a shocker to me to see us trade back down to 440. "
"13388450","13393070"," I don't like that they're rolling out their puts to march now from April though."
"13396170","13397130"," But they're free."
"13402970","13404130"," Have time on them. "
"13412010","13420840"," If Joe Harper's one penny calls and they're printing, what does he care?"
"13422420","13423780"," If his puts don't print."
"13426660","13432820"," I don't think there's a big chance of earnings being leaked for Amazon."
"13434860","13436660"," But sometimes you'll see that happen right?"
"13436660","13437440"," You'll see moves. "
"13437760","13438540"," Sometimes you'll see him drop."
"13441580","13444900"," So I'm starting to position now, just in case somebody knows something we don't know."
"13446540","13459620"," It would"
"13459620","13462060"," be a price target on the QZ if we go higher. "
"13465780","13466380"," Let's see."
"13469680","13502500"," 363.68. Big"
"13502500","13503260"," target above though."
"13503340","13510360"," It'd be 368.24. We say 68. "
"13513340","13513920"," 69."
"13518890","13520190"," Anything above from there?"
"13526360","13527840"," That's still down there at that 368."
"13529140","13529900"," Maybe 375. "
"13530460","13531020"," I doubt that though."
"13533620","13534620"," Thank you for my coffee."
"13535340","13538580"," I love you. "
"13562790","13564170"," John's implying for three days."
"13564370","13566230"," Have you been awake?"
"13566470","13570290"," John asked you to plow with a partner so you guys can sleep in."
"13575320","13576860"," Yeah, Eric, I agree with you on that. "
"13579160","13583040"," John, do you drive with a partner so you guys just plow 24 hours a day?"
"13585580","13588720"," It would be interesting if it's a big nothing burger, right, Eric?"
"13591040","13599590"," It would be interesting to see if there's a if Amazon."
"13600230","13607110"," I have this feeling that just from you don't like these situations that we get put in in the"
"13607110","13607410"," market."
"13608690","13615130"," It reminds me of all these other stupid fucking events that we get where the trade has already"
"13615130","13615590"," happened. "
"13617950","13619310"," The trades already happened."
"13620530","13622310"," The FMC minutes are like classic."
"13627480","13628560"," Yeah, see that up there?"
"13628740","13629400"," That's what I'm looking for. "
"13629620","13630820"," That's my target above right there."
"13632400","13637400"," Like not seeing any kind of the trades already happened, right?"
"13637540","13640120"," The Amazon trade has already sold down 200 points."
"13641760","13643400"," They can just imagine, right?"
"13643720","13649640"," If Amazon earnings were that bad and they already sold down, if they sold down 200 points,"
"13650300","13657530"," everybody would be like, ooh, so like it was the trade missed. "
"13661210","13662910"," And I'll be honest with you."
"13662910","13664350"," This is 100% true."
"13664790","13671890"," If they don't miss their ER and if their guidance is okay, the hedge on the market is coming off. "
"13673030","13675790"," Or at least that's what Spark SG is saying."
"13677690","13678970"," So what if that happens?"
"13681150","13682250"," How do you trade that?"
"13682830","13690050"," The only thing that I can think of the max gain on that trade is zero dates that are dirt"
"13690050","13690370"," cheap."
"13693630","13695170"," The max gain on that trade. "
"13695370","13699370"," How do you make the max amount of money on that trade that Spark Amazon is saying is possible?"
"13701930","13707870"," Max gain on that trade is, well, it's not way, but you know, outside the money calls the cost like"
"13707870","13708850"," a pennies."
"13709530","13710410"," Penny call protection."
"13711230","13712990"," That's the hedge if you're a bear right now. "
"13717330","13720810"," The hedge for you is dirt cheap."
"13720810","13723150"," Mining calling for funding of community policing."
"13729280","13734420"," Telling Mayor Adams of New York City that he can afford to help fight gun violence. "
"13735300","13738000"," But the answer to gun violence is not defunding the police."
"13742540","13750420"," No, there aren't, but there are cheap spreads on Amazon and you can trade it on the spy or the"
"13750420","13750680"," cues."
"13751640","13755780"," So if you're bearish right now and you're like loaded to the, if you're loaded up on being bearish"
"13755780","13761400"," right now, why wouldn't you spend up 10 cents on some outside the money calls to protect yourself?"
"13763520","13768280"," Tesla February 4, 910 P, $397,000. "
"13769480","13770000"," Tesla."
"13779360","13780880"," Yeah, it looks like they're just parking it."
"13781500","13782500"," We've got it's 142. "
"13784140","13788200"," I'm going to take a break here for about 20 minutes to the two o'clock hour."
"13789920","13796120"," And I'll rejoin you here at 2 p.m. and leave on the trade the news guy so that you"
"13796120","13798360"," have him to talk to stick around, talk in the chat."
"13798820","13801880"," I'm going to take a break because I don't think much is going to happen between now and 2 p "
"13801880","13803180",".m. In the market. "
"13803620","13804780"," I think we're all waiting, right?"
"13805000","13805660"," But it should be fireworks."
"13806060","13806480"," It should be."
"13807280","13809820"," That's some point today between the two and four o'clock hour. "
"13810320","13813600"," We should get some fireworks in this market one way or another."
"13818610","13820130"," Amazon is where the banks hide."
"13820990","13821730"," We know that, right?"
"13821950","13828070"," We know when the markets risk off that the banks do hide in Amazon. "
"13828650","13831190"," It's one of their little places that the banks like to hide their money."
"13832130","13837250"," Now I do agree that they want to get a cheaper price on Amazon so they can go back to"
"13837250","13838250"," hiding their money there once again."
"13838250","13841410"," So it could be some capitulation, some more capitulation, the clothes. "
"13842870","13843670"," And I agree."
"13844190","13846850"," The market is hedged for a bad report from Amazon."
"13847610","13850890"," So if we do sell the markets, you better be prepared. "
"13851710","13856230"," So that's my last thing I want to leave you with between now and two p.m. is."
"13857270","13858970"," If you are along this market."
"13861930","13864450"," There is real danger that we could sell this market. "
"13867170","13868750"," So be prepared for that."
"13869690","13874490"," Even if it's just some insurance or getting out of the market for a day."
"13876610","13880390"," Even if you miss us, you know, you can miss us going up 10 points. "
"13881130","13883070"," On the spy in this market."
"13884670","13888530"," And still feel comfortable about your lungs if you're to get out and get back in."
"13891070","13897890"," But there's high volatility risk today in the market into the close and into Friday on both sides. "
"13898750","13902810"," So if you're going to be actively trading this market, the only way you can trade it really is"
"13902810","13904770"," playing both sides right now."
"13906170","13908930"," I don't think you can take a long or short position."
"13909750","13914330"," And if you lose, blame anyone by yourself. "
"13919430","13920930"," That they're acquiring Peton."
"13924330","13926150"," Hey, what's up Tesla Wolf?"
"13926830","13927550"," What's up brother?"
"13928350","13929490"," Got my jams on today."
"13930790","13934570"," We're talking about how we take care of our hair and then someone asked to put a hat on. "
"13934670","13935710"," So I put a new hat on today."
"13940670","13942230"," I do you can be long here."
"13943250","13946890"," Don't come around telling people you told me we were going to do this and we're going to do that"
"13946890","13947490"," right now. "
"13947490","13952050"," There's a lot of risk for both sides and a good argument for both sides."
"13952830","13957390"," And more than likely we're going to get a resolution to the upper downside."
"13958350","13962410"," Every day this week we've made a tech cup big tech walk the plank, right?"
"13963030","13967930"," Every day we're saying get out there down your plank and tell us what's going to happen. "
"13968290","13972410"," Now there is some unusual moves to today in the market."
"13972930","13975970"," The market should have sold off this morning deeper."
"13977290","13980610"," But we know the implications if the market did break for 50. "
"13981210","13984650"," There are some severe, severe consequences."
"13985470","13989730"," And it's not that we sell down five more points as we go down deep, deeper than 420."
"13991050","13996210"," And the fact that that didn't happen means that there's a huge bank out there that's saying no, not"
"13996210","13996450"," yet. "
"13997310","14001010"," So there is a market, a large market manipulation today in the market."
"14001970","14002890"," We know that."
"14004670","14010890"," We know that Amazon's expectations are much lower, right?"
"14011970","14013210"," Four dollars for an ER. "
"14013790","14016830"," They've been consistently getting no less than six to seven."
"14024410","14027090"," So if they were ready to sell this market, they would have just done it this morning."
"14027550","14031390"," We were at the perfect, we're right now at the perfect place to sell this market. "
"14036340","14039540"," Perfect place, perfect day, perfect price, perfect everything."
"14051970","14055590"," Yeah, I wouldn't be buying 5000 C for Amazon tomorrow, two cents."
"14057930","14058890"," Hey, Brian, how are you doing?"
"14066580","14067500"," I'm going to take a quick break. "
"14067620","14068080"," I'll be right back."
"14068700","14071080"," I'll be back for two p.m. to check in real quick."
"14071340","14072380"," So I'm just going to take 12 minute break. "
"14072960","14081420"," If we don't see anything start to get crazy at 2 p.m. and we'll trade."
"14082880","14083700"," We'll trade."
"14084360","14085240"," That's my thing. "
"14085540","14092320"," This is my thing about Amazon and today, specifically just today."
"14093240","14095320"," I don't know that they need the split today."
"14096100","14097140"," You guys know, right?"
"14097400","14104500"," You guys know, ever notice how you like you'll see, you'll see the banks give you an answer on"
"14104500","14105340"," anything, right?"
"14105340","14111280"," The XLY April 14th, 192 C, $242,000. "
"14111640","14115880"," A firm February 4th, 60 C, $148,000."
"14117080","14124000"," Some flow coming in for BP, 35 C for 318 March 18th, 35 C."
"14124460","14127720"," A lot of it just sweeps spread around, sprinkled around."
"14128460","14131080"," The thing I want to talk to you guys about real quick is if I don't know if you guys"
"14131080","14132940"," caught this earlier, the important thing I want to talk to you about. "
"14133180","14139820"," Sometimes the banks will tell you something like, well, we sold down just as an example out of the"
"14139820","14139980"," blue."
"14140320","14144140"," Well, we sold down Apple because of XYZ."
"14144860","14149300"," And then they go, well, we sold down Netflix because of that same XYZ. "
"14149940","14152860"," And we sold Tesla because of XYZ, right?"
"14153300","14158840"," So you're like three times that they've sold a stock down and you say to yourself, well, if I know"
"14158840","14162820"," if XYZ happens, that they're going to sell down Amazon now."
"14163840","14168640"," And then Amazon comes along and they do the same XYZ and it doesn't get sold down."
"14169040","14172680"," And they give you a new reason and they say, well, it's coming up though because of this. "
"14173300","14175060"," And you'll see it in the news oftentimes."
"14175500","14179480"," You'll say, but we have a, wait a minute, you just sold three tickers down because of XYZ."
"14180280","14181960"," And they had a, they had ABC. "
"14182740","14183940"," So why didn't you sell that down?"
"14183940","14187480"," You start to try to figure out your mind, you realize that this market is manipulated."
"14188200","14188940"," Stocks are manipulated."
"14189480","14192260"," Banks know where they want certain tickers or where they want to buy certain tickers. "
"14192680","14193800"," So that's my only thing today."
"14193920","14195580"," My crux today is where we are."
"14195700","14196780"," We sold down 200 points. "
"14197500","14198840"," Get an expectation of four bucks."
"14199800","14201220"," I hope we beat that by six or seven."
"14201240","14202840"," They could just claim they doubled expectations. "
"14203760","14205020"," Some kind of nonsense like that."
"14206320","14208100"," So that's my concern into the close."
"14209360","14210880"," That's my contrarian trade today. "
"14214190","14216210"," Well, if it splits, it's going to be banging."
"14224230","14225850"," Yeah, you could do a split trade on that too."
"14225930","14227450"," I don't know if I go as deep as 400 P."
"14234580","14236040"," But there's some nice trades you could take. "
"14236700","14241500"," But I'm telling you, if you're going to trade this market in a close today, please, please, please."
"14241900","14243000"," Have some kind of a."
"14244500","14245640"," You can do your own thesis."
"14245960","14247460"," Like if you're like, Hey, I am bullish. "
"14248460","14251220"," Into tomorrow or Hey, I am bearish into tomorrow."
"14252300","14253080"," Load up on that stuff."
"14253760","14254780"," Have fun with it. "
"14255600","14259020"," But then by the cheaper side to protect yourself."
"14261160","14263280"," You guys, I know you guys by call."
"14263400","14265160"," I know some of you are just one sided. "
"14265640","14268320"," So let's say you buy calls for the cost of a dollar, right?"
"14270060","14271820"," And they dive 10 cents."
"14272520","14275480"," You don't care about a losing 10 cents of value yet."
"14275540","14280080"," You won't buy 10 cents puts to cover those calls to have to absorb it. "
"14280080","14286780"," If you're not as committed to a movement big enough to cover the cheap side on the on the hedge,"
"14287440","14289360"," then why even trade it?"
"14290120","14293480"," They trade it for just 10% or 20%."
"14294020","14296160"," Nothing don't take profit on 10 or 20%."
"14296160","14299400"," But the target should be looking for 100% move. "
"14300220","14307560"," Maybe not in the in the in the option, but 100% gain in whatever option you're buying or selling."
"14308060","14321280"," Oh, that's"
"14321280","14321800"," untrue too."
"14323640","14324760"," I guess it could be true. "
"14325380","14328120"," I guess Google's splitting to get into the Dow, right?"
"14328860","14329820"," I have that right or wrong."
"14334700","14339520"," Post cons of buying 10 to 10, one cent calls versus two five cent calls."
"14340080","14341560"," No, there's a good point in this too. "
"14341820","14344120"," Let's your boomer brings up a good point that we should talk about."
"14345460","14346940"," There are concerns there."
"14349820","14352740"," So there are some concerns with one cent and five cent calls. "
"14357280","14363220"," On there's a runway on time on those two."
"14364340","14366040"," Let's say you buy a one cent call."
"14366400","14367860"," There's problems with one cent calls. "
"14369520","14373200"," If you buy a one cent call that's like zero day one day."
"14376180","14381720"," If the market makers don't think we're going to go there, they'll never increase in value."
"14382000","14383720"," Even if we make them move into that direction. "
"14385400","14389300"," They won't start to print them unless there's even a chance of those hitting."
"14389660","14390960"," Like they have to have a chance of hitting."
"14393580","14399760"," And another problem is the violence swings can kill five cent options down to one cent. "
"14400780","14402580"," When the move is actually happening."
"14402920","14408380"," So if you're going about those, I usually recommend that you're doing it very time sensitive like."
"14409540","14411040"," Just as the move is happening. "
"14414520","14419540"," It's very complex trading one penny and five penny options unless they're far, far dated out."
"14422060","14423680"," Unless there's time on them."
"14425720","14426860"," They're very dangerous. "
"14429280","14431380"," Now I bought four sixty one's today."
"14431700","14434460"," Now let me explain why the mine cost me I think ten cents."
"14435040","14437860"," Now they're probably going to go down to a value of five cents for an update. "
"14438500","14441160"," But I'll keep building into that position if they do go down lower."
"14441800","14443620"," But I'm buying those because of this right here, right?"
"14445700","14449620"," If we end up squeezing higher, we're looking at four fifty seven."
"14450400","14456580"," We don't have to actually get to four sixty one. "
"14456580","14462020"," Four sixty a threat of it for these to go up four hundred five hundred percent."
"14465820","14468440"," I'm not trying to make money for seventy C's."
"14468840","14469580"," I like them. "
"14472280","14473480"," But I've been caught."
"14474040","14477060"," I've had I've had market makers fuck me on."
"14477820","14482440"," Penny Penny calls and penny puts that are just dated. "
"14485400","14487340"," Like expiring today, expiring tomorrow."
"14490640","14494070"," All right, I'm going to take a break."
"14495790","14496550"," That's funny. "
"14496690","14497470"," Funny as hell."
"14499750","14501330"," Like so many questions."
"14502890","14503570"," So much. "
"14503730","14506230"," Do we have to make classes of ninety dollars a barrel?"
"14510400","14513220"," We make classes about selling and buying to."
"14520410","14522790"," Cutting legs off spreads is a big one we talk about."
"14541050","14543070"," Yeah, I think we're I mean, it's not that we're not close. "
"14543550","14547930"," The thing you have to think about is it doesn't matter if we trade down to four hundred or four"
"14547930","14548290"," twenty."
"14548790","14549910"," This is the season."
"14551270","14554230"," February and March is the season that we buy for summer. "
"14555550","14559790"," So if you have time horizon is June, you can buy down here anywhere."
"14559910","14560590"," It doesn't really matter."
"14561550","14562510"," It's probably going to print. "
"14563490","14564570"," Into June, it will."
"14565930","14567690"," If your time horizon is farther out."
"14570110","14572010"," Personally for me, I'm just a small retail trader. "
"14572230","14577610"," So I don't have the bank or the bailouts for me to make a wrong decision."
"14577990","14579410"," So for me, I don't think we've hit bottom."
"14581130","14583590"," From now into March, I don't think we've hit bottom. "
"14585970","14586430"," Seasonally."
"14588570","14591070"," February is the worst performing month."
"14591790","14593530"," Although we just did just have it in January. "
"14595710","14598870"," So I think even if I missed the ride, I have a chance to catch it at some point."
"14600430","14602890"," I don't feel like I'm panicked at any moment."
"14603430","14607310"," I don't need to panic until mid March mid April. "
"14607310","14612250"," And if I missed the ride up, I'd rather miss 10% of the ride up."
"14612890","14614410"," Then not grab the lower end."
"14614790","14616690"," I'm a trade opposite that a lot of people. "
"14617370","14617950"," There's a lot of like."
"14618670","14623390"," A lot of what you told how you told the trade invest and I tend to trade invest slightly different."
"14628930","14631690"," QQQ's puts February 11th, 345 P."
"14632330","14634430"," 600 or $650,000. "

"14663230","14664130"," Yeah, I see a pinning. "
"14665370","14666630"," Even if we're buying bottoms here."
"14680710","14682450"," What would you like an explanation on the Samper?"
"14688660","14689780"," I'm still here, Samper."
"14689900","14690260"," What would you like?"
"14692680","14693680"," Oh, are you talking to Josh?"
"14699200","14700460"," All right, I'm going to take a break over right back. "
"14730060","14733160"," If anyone doesn't know about golden tickets, I'll come back and talk about them later."
"14733660","14737360"," You can probably Google search what they are and get an information off Google."
"14737860","14740340"," If not, I'll get back and I'll talk to you guys about them, how to trade them too. "
"14740840","14744540"," We'll bring up a chart and stuff and show you guys how to actually trade golden tickets."

"17600800","17602200"," Now you can't. "
"17602660","17609660"," Due to do to Amazon reporting, of course, it kind of throws a random random event into it."
"17611480","17615060"," Under normal circumstances, if Amazon was not reporting today."
"17616460","17618620"," This move lower right here would signify. "

"17643770","17645150"," I'm going to hop back on real quick. "
"17645230","17646090"," I want to talk to you guys about some."
"17646430","17648390"," So under normal circumstances, right?"
"17650070","17651890"," Let's say we weren't in ER season."
"17652370","17654470"," We weren't we weren't in Amazon season. "
"17656250","17659410"," Well, like where Amazon wasn't reporting to that or normal circumstances."
"17660790","17662550"," Where the market is right now."
"17663310","17665290"," The fact that we sold off. "
"17665870","17670370"," At four sixty yesterday, we couldn't break above four sixty break above."
"17670710","17671310"," This is classic."
"17671370","17672810"," You'll see this in stocks. "
"17673630","17677990"," That are selling like down, like specifically, SQ is a great, a great primer on this."
"17678610","17681590"," If like if you look at SQ and how bulls get trapped."
"17682250","17686450"," If just looking at the ETF spy right now, and if this was a normal stock. "
"17687070","17688890"," And you sold off, you broke."
"17689950","17697010"," You didn't even break through that that down channel, that major resistance channel on a stock just"
"17697010","17698110"," like spy right now."
"17699030","17701030"," And you see this happening here. "
"17701250","17701890"," It sets up."
"17703290","17708570"," It sets up a move way lower way lower and fast."
"17710610","17715250"," Now, another take on this would be we'd retest down below here like four forty six. "
"17715590","17717930"," You'd have a move higher to like four sixty four seventy."
"17718550","17722210"," And then an even bigger move down to like three three ninety or so."
"17723170","17724190"," Under normal circumstances. "
"17724190","17729310"," But due to we still have the Amazon question, right?"
"17729430","17730790"," How does Amazon report here?"
"17732130","17738230"," But normally at this point, you would see some significant selling in an individual ticker at this"
"17738230","17738570"," point."
"17739010","17742270"," This is trading like it should keep going down."
"17744990","17748290"," Now, you still can't add in what does Amazon do, right?"
"17748570","17751330"," Amazon can change this market at any point at any time. "
"17752250","17755230"," Maybe not as they might not change IWM as much."
"17755330","17757630"," That might be where all that put flow comes in on IWM."
"17758430","17762450"," Rather than take a look at I'd even see how bad it's selling off. "
"17763190","17767490"," So I'd have is probably a more risk than the spy."
"17768210","17770150"," IWM is also the internals of the market."
"17770350","17771930"," So it's always important to know that. "
"17774090","17775530"," The health of the market."
"17776010","17780890"," But this does, you know, under normal circumstances if we didn't have Amazon hanging over us right"
"17780890","17781090"," now."
"17781650","17783950"," And we had that huge rejection yesterday. "
"17784570","17789230"," You'd be looking to not only retest the lows at this point, but an ultimate target."
"17790470","17793870"," You know, I don't want to say it because every time I say things to you guys, you guys take"
"17793870","17794570"," a shot of context."
"17794750","17797570"," So I got to be careful with my words in this live stream. "
"17800930","17806810"," But ultimately it'd be retesting lows that would be even lower than our last low."
"17807310","17812590"," Our last hammer that the low that we hammered out quote unquote down at 420."
"17813770","17815410"," And we're not far from it again. "
"17815710","17817890"," So just isn't even saying that, right?"
"17818030","17819950"," We're not that far away from 420 now."
"17822370","17823990"," There are four 47 70."
"17824590","17827970"," We've broken through some pretty major support. "
"17828690","17831710"," The bulls do have, you know, some some major support levels."
"17831810","17834950"," You can see if you just look on any chart, right?"
"17835110","17839570"," You can see that this is a nice level here or not with this level of this for 4, 4 "
"17839570","17843570",",500, 44, 6.89 was a zone."
"17845090","17846770"," Of of support. "
"17847090","17848450"," I'm having some issues with my."
"17853120","17860980"," You know, this is a contentious area, but we have broken down now below into the original bear"
"17860980","17864550"," channel that we created way back in on January and January 24th."
"17865160","17865340"," Right?"
"17865860","17866900"," In fact, I'll put this. "
"17867020","17871560"," I'll put this chart up on Twitter so we can have a better understanding."
"17873580","17875020"," Of where I'm coming from here."
"17875580","17878780"," I'll put this up on Twitter for you guys so you can see what I'm talking about. "
"17880760","17883100"," But this break here is important, right?"
"17883480","17889760"," If we break through the last bit of it is going to be 4, 4, 6.87. If you break"
"17889760","17893780"," through 4, 4, 6.87, you're ultimately targeting."
"17895460","17896300"," 431 49."
"17897860","17900620"," You can't catch this third bounce down here somewhere. "
"17903000","17904460"," You're not going to catch it, right?"
"17905040","17906180"," And I'll show you guys this."
"17906360","17907920"," I'll post this for you guys."
"17912950","17913370"," On. "
"17915350","17918270"," Twitter real quick so you can see what I'm trying to talk to you guys about."
"17920050","17925210"," Get some sort of visualization of what I'm talking about."
"17926310","17932350"," You know, this right here. "
"17933430","17934770"," And this right here."
"17936470","17937710"," This is the channel."
"17937890","17939950"," We're working our way back into an old channel. "
"17943600","17950540"," And if we continue to, we're in the channel now, technically broke the channel this morning at the"
"17950540","17950840"," open."
"17950840","17961120"," And I'll actually"
"17961120","17962600"," make another one for you here."
"17964700","17969320"," And the implication is for the bear case, I'll show you what the implication is for the bear case"
"17969320","17969740"," as well. "
"17971600","17975380"," What the bear case is here."
"17982540","17983640"," Something like this."
"17995120","17999920"," If you guys want to show you a head and shoulders too, what the head and shoulders looks like. "
"18002700","18004300"," I'll bring that one up."
"18005000","18011020"," And then I'll actually bring up where the head and shoulders is that's developing."
"18014820","18020540"," I think I drew it out on trading view the other day. "
"18023180","18032060"," I've got the other kind of bastardizing my chart on."
"18032060","18034480"," I'm going to show you guys a bunch of different charts right now."
"18040230","18041990"," This would be the other shoulder here. "
"18047080","18048040"," Let's save this one."
"18054890","18056750"," Show you the head and shoulders pattern."
"18057150","18057470"," Here we go. "
"18057530","18058810"," I'm going to start posting this stuff right now."
"18067080","18070160"," The first two are just some spy charts for day trading."
"18070160","18073720"," The last one is the head and shoulders pattern. "
"18080120","18082280"," As opposed to those out there so you guys can take a look at them."
"18085770","18091770"," And now that you're trading back into, so you've traded outside of the range of the bear flag."
"18092830","18093130"," Right?"
"18093290","18094750"," That's on the spy. "
"18095430","18103530"," You're now trading back into the trading range of the spy of this bear flag."
"18103530","18106670"," And the question is, does it fall right off and down and below?"
"18109550","18113510"," There could be some sideways movement to then a future drop off."
"18118980","18126900"," Now, the only thing that I would give here as we trade into the three o'clock hour is the"
"18126900","18127660"," Amazon question. "
"18127660","18133480"," And that's the one that that's the one sometimes I talk about Bitcoin, how it tends to trade to"
"18133480","18138760"," more traditional charting technicals."
"18139080","18140100"," Five minutes or so."
"18140220","18141140"," We'll see the close a pitch rating. "
"18141140","18147040"," The U.S. bomb markets, treasure yields have gone higher here in today's session at one body, 2% in"
"18147040","18154520"," the 10 year 1.19% in the two year yield yields dragged higher by hawkish commentary from both the"
"18154520","18157360"," Bank of England and the ECB at their meetings."
"18159420","18164120"," Yeah, if you can continue upward pressure and oil prices hitting fresh eight year highs above $90"
"18164120","18165360"," now in WTI career."
"18167200","18171800"," Also take note in that conversation that guy just had, you don't want to see yields at 2%. "
"18173720","18176480"," That's usually when the market can really roll over."
"18193100","18197680"," So the only other thing you'd talk about today would be the Amazon question outside of the Amazon"
"18197680","18198380"," question."
"18203080","18207520"," Normally under normal circumstances, this would this should roll down steeply. "
"18214120","18216700"," That's the only thing you're waiting on is just Amazon at this point."
"18216900","18221060"," Because Amazon beat earnings has kickass guidance outside of that."
"18222140","18224520"," This was any other normal situation. "
"18226800","18232080"," Some of the only way of guys would say we tag here trade higher to like 460 then trade lower"
"18232080","18233060"," to 420 again."
"18233640","18239680"," There's some counts that have it there, but there are other accounts like basic counts where on the"
"18239680","18245680"," last chart that I posted, it would just be a one down one up and then one big one down"
"18245680","18246740"," in a much bigger move."
"18251660","18258680"," Just basic forget the left shoulder right shoulder bullshit forget the three different counts that"
"18258680","18262700"," you have the bullish counts, the bearish counts in the alley wave sort of basic move. "
"18265440","18268900"," You would see a much much lower price on spy."
"18298270","18306210"," Yes, outside of the only unknown news that we have is Amazon and everything weighs on Amazon at"
"18306210","18306570"," this point."
"18306810","18309750"," Next question, whatever you get, it's 3 p.m. we're coming into 3 p.m. hour. "
"18312290","18314150"," We have way more sellers than buyers."
"18314830","18315970"," Here are indicators okay."
"18317350","18319890"," Do we get capitulation into clothes and then rip higher?"
"18320610","18322110"," All questions that haven't been answered yet. "
"18330910","18332310"," I still have my puts on."
"18332430","18334990"," I haven't cashed any of them in."
"18335150","18336250"," So I'm still holding all my puts. "
"18338170","18341430"," I bought some FDs for the clothes."
"18341830","18343210"," Let me see where those are at."
"18351080","18352320"," They're not doing too bad. "
"18353180","18354560"," There's still have some value in them."
"18354800","18356440"," Maybe actually some good value in them."
"18357020","18358200"," So I'm going to stick in those. "
"18358460","18360080"," I'm not going to cut those loose here."
"18360640","18362880"," I think we still have that dynamo."
"18362960","18364700"," We have got the dynamo definitely have Amazon. "
"18364700","18365920"," What happens with Amazon?"
"18374360","18377800"," That actually adds some more some more calls to this."
"18377800","18380560"," Let's see."
"18384080","18386860"," Probably going to add to my position right now. "
"18394020","18395260"," Just a second here."
"18478170","18479210"," Alright, hang tight here."
"18479450","18480990"," So now I've got some 460s. "
"18481450","18487410"," I've got some 461s, 460s on Spy."
"18488010","18489110"," All expiring tomorrow."
"18489110","18491290"," Just some cheap calls. "
"18491330","18496890"," I had more at the bell waiting on Amazon report."
"18498470","18501950"," But under normal circumstances if we didn't have Amazon reporting today."
"18503570","18504750"," Very bearish. "
"18508950","18510430"," Very bearish move here."
"18511570","18513190"," Looking for a break below."
"18513450","18518350"," If you are bearish, you're looking for a break below 446.89 next. "
"18518350","18527240"," And then let's take a look on the book map here."
"18550650","18558510"," Now this is all this area down here is where we don't want to break here at this 443"
"18558510","18560910"," or so."
"18562450","18563210"," Excuse me. "
"18568200","18569480"," Group video call."
"18569740","18570360"," What's that from?"
"18572540","18574180"," It's trying to call me in the group video call."
"18586870","18588810"," 440, 440, 439. "
"18600430","18600950"," 435."
"18601550","18601910"," One hour now."
"18602070","18602770"," One hour now. "
"18602790","18605290"," The doubt that I'm more than 400 points."
"18605530","18608330"," The S&P down 95 handles and the."
"18608970","18612150"," Now is that composite down 451 points. "
"18614170","18615570"," There it is right there 430."
"18619030","18620990"," Facebook more calls just bought on it."
"18621450","18624350"," June 17th 220 C."
"18625230","18626810"," 8.5 million dollars. "
"18627210","18630330"," If you are panicking to the market right now, do want to let you know that."
"18631190","18634970"," If you are new to the market, this is time of the year where."
"18635830","18636650"," Thanks by. "
"18637510","18638310"," The market."
"18638710","18640390"," You see Facebook down right now."
"18641010","18642790"," Millions and millions of. "
"18643590","18646130"," Calls bought on Facebook today."
"18648010","18651310"," Just averaging in so where you might be panicking if you're a bull."
"18651750","18653030"," There are banks that. "
"18653530","18654850"," This is just the norm, right?"
"18655210","18658050"," Looking for a place to buy play in different places in the market."
"18658050","18658970"," Different tickers."
"18660370","18664070"," We've noticed all this past two months we've seen. "
"18664490","18666350"," Individual tickers, different tickers, right?"
"18666350","18669350"," Some of them are just like 20 bucks a ticker or 20 bucks a share."
"18669950","18672790"," And you'll see millions go into those shares for summertime."
"18673690","18675890"," You see it happening right now on Facebook. "
"18676730","18678810"," It's all doom and gloom and Facebook, but."
"18679330","18683690"," You see the big buys for June summer buying for Facebook today."
"18687710","18692670"," If you want some safety buys, even though it's hell on wheels right now for Facebook. "
"18693390","18698290"," We know that there's major buying on Facebook at the same time that there's major selling."
"18702590","18705410"," Someone bought $40 million in Facebook calls."
"18706210","18710590"," The majority of those millions are on June 17 to 20 C."
"18711990","18714990"," Big banks buying for Facebook. "
"18715530","18717550"," Now they can move their money around reposition themselves."
"18717790","18720610"," They have more money than you do, right?"
"18722510","18726270"," But at some point, Facebook's pretty close to where it needs to be."
"18728290","18730870"," I was just on the phone with Joe Donut talking to him about it. "
"18731150","18733850"," And, you know, just take a look at Facebook."
"18735230","18737850"," Over the course of the year, they were at 548, I think."
"18738490","18739430"," And now they're down to 236. "
"18740290","18740490"," What was it?"
"18740590","18740890"," 438?"
"18741090","18741650"," I forget what they were."
"18743450","18745910"," And they're at 340, 384."
"18746790","18755090"," And now they're almost at 50% off or 47, it's like 43 or 4%, something like that. "
"18755350","18758610"," 43% discount on Facebook right now."
"18762430","18766750"," If you'd asked somebody back in September, what would we be at?"
"18766770","18768970"," Would we be at 236 today?"
"18769810","18771430"," And the answer more than likely would be no."
"18771430","18774970"," No, there's no way we're down at that price today. "
"18775970","18781890"," So when we talk about looking for discounts on companies, there's some banks right now saying, this"
"18781890","18782490"," is a great discount."
"18782750","18783450"," I'm going to buy here."
"18783510","18786710"," They could trade down another 10 bucks or another 50 bucks. "
"18787310","18790310"," For the time horizon in June, you're probably pretty good and safe."
"18790710","18792330"," They'll at least make your money back."
"18794990","18797510"," So when you're asking me, do I think this company will trade down?"
"18797610","18798030"," Yes, I do. "
"18798940","18802890"," We're down at 2766 on app on Amazon right now."
"18803770","18804970"," What do they say?"
"18805130","18805470"," What's the joke?"
"18805730","18806850"," Generational buying opportunity?"
"18813390","18817090"," Question then brings in a question, not only Amazon, but Tesla."
"18817910","18819830"," The brings up the question about Apple. "
"18820650","18822770"," Does Amazon take Apple down with it?"
"18823510","18825370"," Does Amazon take Tesla down with it?"
"18826310","18828270"," Does Amazon take down Shopify?"
"18829430","18830510"," Or Etsy?"
"18831430","18834270"," Because these are all online buying companies."
"18834670","18839130"," We heard yesterday that personal spending is down."
"18839950","18845070"," We heard yesterday that the unemployment numbers aren't good. "
"18846330","18852530"," We heard yesterday or we hear Friday more, more employment numbers, right?"
"18852710","18857050"," We've got more jobs numbers coming out on Friday, another negative catalyst."
"18860170","18867390"," Today, a big one is that the dollar is not going to be as worth as much as anticipated from"
"18867390","18876390"," foreign nations that are going to implement their own anti-inflation regimes, right?"
"18876570","18883150"," Raising rates across other emerging markets, emerging countries, which doesn't help inflation in"
"18883150","18885850"," the U.S., all negative news catalysts."
"18887630","18890470"," The last of big tech reporting is today, Amazon. "
"18892650","18893270"," There's others."
"18893530","18893850"," There's snow."
"18894130","18897750"," There's Shopify, all kinds of other companies, but let's talk big tech, right?"
"18898310","18898770"," Thank man. "
"18899270","18899570"," Tesla."
"18900610","18901270"," All it's done."
"18910720","18916920"," So I've been trading in the money, zero dates, one dates, whatever is available in the spy all the"
"18916920","18917560"," way up from 420. "
"18917560","18926360"," And what I didn't do was buy any calls that were, let's say, 420 C's dated for next month."
"18927580","18934260"," So I am interested if any of you out there did buy in the money call in any ticker."
"18934460","18936020"," That's like a month, three months out. "
"18936280","18938780"," Let me know if you're just back to break even right now."
"18939260","18940680"," Are you in the red right now on those?"
"18940880","18945820"," It seems like we're at a moment in the market where if you bought the bottom with far dated calls,"
"18946300","18952660"," you should either be in the red or coming into the red here soon where we are currently in the"
"18952660","18952920"," market."
"18956600","18960100"," Yeah, personal spending is down for a whole ton of reasons. "
"18967500","18969940"," Personal spending is down for a whole bunch of reasons."
"18972580","18973900"," Part of it is the rent, right?"
"18974020","18974740"," We don't count the rent."
"18976700","18978560"," We also have some problems though. "
"18978680","18980140"," People bought goods already, right?"
"18980300","18983480"," When everybody was locked up at home, they bought all their shit about bicycles."
"18984340","18988080"," They bought fucking pizza rollers."
"18988240","18989500"," They bought new furniture. "
"18990680","18992280"," They bought everything from Wayfair."
"18992920","18996360"," They bought $150,000 trucks from Ford."
"18998000","18999680"," You know, they've done all this shit. "
"18999680","19004700"," And so now you're looking to see, hey, are you going to spend some money on services?"
"19005740","19007260"," That don't mean like McDonald's."
"19007440","19009200"," I'm talking like, are you going to Disneyland?"
"19009900","19011040"," Are you going to a concert?"
"19011780","19014060"," Are you going to go skiing?"
"19014780","19019560"," Are you actually spending money out of it like your local neighborhood fair?"
"19020480","19021260"," Like events?"
"19022180","19024200"," Are you going to busters?"
"19024560","19026540"," I don't know if it's called busters."
"19026620","19028440"," I don't go there, but it's a big ticker. "
"19028440","19031980"," But like are you going there and spending money on games and food?"
"19035440","19038940"," Are you spending money just on a good time?"
"19039320","19040180"," And people aren't."
"19043320","19047380"," You get a mad rush for housing because of the fear of rate increases."
"19048700","19050020"," That's something to do with it. "
"19054070","19056110"," You have people getting or not working."
"19056810","19058450"," The claim is they're getting better jobs."
"19058450","19059290"," That's part of it. "
"19059350","19063550"," But there's some people that aren't working that are normally working."
"19073700","19077200"," I have a family member that works for a large company."
"19079800","19088740"," And she's told me that they've rescinded higher pay rates to new hires. "
"19089340","19093900"," So if they were hiring people and they were giving everybody bonuses, they're giving everybody"
"19093900","19095220"," higher pay rates."
"19096220","19105900"," And then they've rescinded since rescinded some of that in anticipation of inflation going"
"19105900","19106240"," down."
"19106860","19111800"," So I don't know what is going on here. "
"19115210","19117790"," You get these random video calls."
"19117950","19120790"," I think this is my daughter's friends trying to zoom me maybe."
"19127180","19128500"," I'm just trying to video call me. "
"19137820","19139040"," Is it David Busters?"
"19140080","19140580"," Yeah."
"19140740","19142680"," I'm using it as just as an example."
"19146790","19153570"," There are people out there spending money on services that aren't going to McDonald's or your local"
"19153570","19154510"," Wendy's dumpster. "
"19157150","19163520"," I noticed so I live, currently live in Michigan and there's this little outside metro."
"19163520","19166980"," They have these little metro communities outside of the city, right?"
"19167560","19171580"," And they have even in the city, even in, let's say, do you go to downtown Detroit?"
"19171780","19177660"," They've got this huge farmers market, open air market, and it's not the same."
"19178940","19180740"," Like events are not the same. "
"19182060","19184140"," There's not as many people as not as many services."
"19184140","19184860"," Park City."
"19185060","19192840"," I spend a lot of time in Park City and they just shut down a huge race in Park City. "
"19194400","19194940"," Permanently."
"19196940","19197740"," It's an attraction."
"19200880","19204990"," Part of the whole personal spending thing. "
"19216980","19218280"," So we'll see into the close here."
"19218340","19224900"," It's 3 12 p.m. I hope that you are hedged in both directions so you can make money off"
"19224900","19225840"," these directional moves."
"19231920","19232840"," Wendy's dumpster. "
"19234780","19236800"," You don't know about Wendy's dumpster."
"19236800","19237980"," You haven't been there before?"
"19248320","19249460"," It's hard to get tickets."
"19249720","19250580"," So I normally ski. "
"19250720","19252100"," I ski even this winter."
"19252320","19258280"," I've been skiing, but normally, even up to last year, I usually take a winter trip, spend some a"
"19258280","19259860"," month or so out in the mountains."
"19260760","19262920"," And this year I chose not to. "
"19263280","19268220"," I couldn't justify the price this year versus even last year."
"19272840","19273620"," I couldn't."
"19273640","19274560"," I couldn't justify it. "
"19275320","19276720"," And to be honest with you."
"19277360","19278560"," This is just a guy."
"19278640","19280300"," This is a what I think what you call these. "
"19283080","19286000"," They don't really mean anything, but I remember."
"19288800","19290380"," Like an antidote, an antidote."
"19292640","19295700"," I remember when I lived in Vale. "
"19297300","19298380"," I lived there."
"19298800","19302380"," I was a ski bum there during the last boom."
"19304380","19309220"," And this is when Enron owned like three quarters of Beaver Creek. "
"19311280","19314340"," And we're talking just throwing stupid money away."
"19315120","19315620"," Like stupid."
"19316860","19319180"," It was like no price that you could pay. "
"19320120","19321820"," No shampers that you could drink."
"19322360","19322700"," No food."
"19323420","19324800"," I mean like bring over the truffles. "
"19325460","19327460"," Let's shave off two ounces of white truffles."
"19331160","19333520"," Crystal bottles of it bottles of it."

"24168230","24170390"," Then you follow them, right?"
"24170790","24171890"," Bounce your trades off them."
"24173550","24174790"," Ask them what they're doing. "
"24174990","24175330"," Ask them."
"24175430","24176450"," Hey, what do you think about what I'm doing?"
"24177810","24179390"," I'm not understanding what Kevin's saying."
"24179490","24180210"," Kevin's saying this. "
"24180310","24180930"," Kevin's saying that."
"24181070","24181430"," What does he mean?"
"24182350","24187710"," If you bounce in and out of these feeds and these broadcasts, we change our positioning all the"
"24187710","24187950"," time."
"24188070","24189510"," We'll change from bear to bull. "
"24190410","24191990"," Wherever we need to be to make money."
"24192330","24193890"," At the end of the day, the only thing that matters."
"24194270","24195910"," This is some key I want all of you to know. "
"24197550","24200150"," That you're going to get bombarded by people on social media."
"24200570","24202710"," They're going to say think that there's very snarky."
"24202710","24204890"," They'll say things like, well, you said this and you said that. "
"24205610","24207550"," But they, you know, they stop in, stop out."
"24207850","24212130"," What they don't do is they don't actively trade the market day in, so that you know when to make"
"24212130","24212410"," money."
"24212730","24215630"," You're not going to sit in any position that you're going to lose money in on, right?"
"24216010","24218610"," Because you're hard headed unless it's something that's protective. "
"24219530","24220910"," But you are going to take positions."
"24220990","24221750"," They're going to make you money."
"24221850","24224790"," So in the day, as long as you're making money, it doesn't matter. "
"24225670","24227030"," As long as you're making money."
"24227410","24228590"," It's the only thing that matters."
"24230050","24231370"," You're the one paying your bills. "
"24235790","24237730"," Bread's like I'll be trading futures too next week."
"24238890","24239250"," Money."
"24239570","24240410"," It's all that matters. "
"24242270","24244190"," Oh, hey, thanks, Willie Smoke for tipping."
"24244810","24248450"," You can, there's two ways to tip in the description of the YouTube video."
"24249470","24253990"," Down in the description, there's a tip link right at the right. "
"24254150","24255950"," When you go to the description of the video is a way to tip."
"24256370","24260810"," And then if you don't want to tip there, you can go straight to at captains alpha."
"24260810","24265870"," On Twitter, go to my profile and I have a pinned tweet at the top. "
"24266370","24269390"," And there's a direct link to the tip just with a straight credit card."
"24269810","24271030"," You don't have to tip through PayPal that way."
"24271950","24272810"," I appreciate asking. "
"24276190","24277730"," Thank you very much, Desperato."
"24280570","24284750"," Yeah, you guys can trade with me, trade against me, whatever you want to do."
"24284850","24286190"," You guys can just paper trade with me. "
"24286550","24289670"," Open up a think or swim account or we, I think we will offer is paper trading."
"24289670","24290990"," Just paper trade it."
"24291430","24293530"," Just do it for like one, three, four, five days. "
"24294050","24295170"," Check in with everybody here."
"24295850","24301750"," And you guys can eventually figure out when we're all going in one direction with the market or not"
"24301750","24303230"," or when we're hedged or when we're not."
"24307490","24311390"," Had a couple of killer trades this week, more than a couple. "
"24317710","24319170"," You guys all have a wonderful night."
"24319470","24320330"," We'll talk to all you guys tomorrow."
"24321930","24323370"," I'm a little shaken right now. "
"24325830","24330270"," I'm like, I'll check all you guys tomorrow."
"24330690","24331990"," Keep your fingers crossed for tomorrow."
"24332190","24333130"," We're able to get a nice spring. "
"24333670","24340510"," We can get a nice, nice, nice lifting of the hedging on the market that we trade up tomorrow."
"24341190","24343170"," That shorts cut themselves loose."
"24344290","24346590"," That puts are closed or just sold. "
"24347450","24349370"," That the market makes a move higher for Friday."
"24349830","24352130"," We get a VIX dump into Friday clothes."
"24353250","24355390"," It could be a really good day tomorrow. "
"24356990","24360170"," If we dump VIX tomorrow, it could be a solid day."
"24360470","24364550"," If it doesn't print that heavy, let's say they pin the market for Friday, we can take it into"
"24364550","24365210"," Monday as well."
"24374090","24375430"," Hell no, I don't drink a drive. "
"24376350","24377710"," No, we're drinking and driving."
"24378830","24381010"," As a matter of fact, I have one daughter."
"24381850","24383610"," I don't drink a drive, by the way, at all. "
"24384310","24387290"," I do have one daughter that's almost at legal driving age."
"24388090","24389270"," And I can't wait for that."
"24390150","24392830"," I use Uber and left. "
"24393410","24394130"," No drinking and driving."
"24399510","24401410"," Want me to go to bed tonight, so I'm up for tomorrow?"
"24402010","24402730"," You know what's going to happen?"
"24402730","24403710"," I'm going to bed tonight, right?"
"24404070","24406290"," We're going to bed, and all I'm going to think about is futures."
"24406730","24408170"," It's all I'm going to think about all night long. "
"24408930","24409910"," Futures, futures, futures."
"24415900","24418040"," No, so low four F."
"24418380","24427020"," The problem with tomorrow is that you have a risk appetite coming off the market tomorrow."
"24427900","24431280"," You have an event that is now over. "
"24431820","24433420"," Everybody's focused on Amazon, right?"
"24434360","24436220"," And now you have two things."
"24436920","24438580"," First off, the event is over."
"24438760","24447880"," The Amazon event itself is over, and then it turned out to be a positive event as well, right?"
"24448140","24449700"," So you'll see hedging come off the market. "
"24449700","24455260"," You'll see shorts come off the market, and the market will breathe a little bit."
"24455680","24458300"," Even if we had lower later, the market will still breathe."
"24458940","24459500"," That's the expectation. "
"24460300","24462440"," Don't call me to things like, hey, he said something."
"24463080","24466640"," It's has to be right a hundred percent of time, but that's the, that's what we're doing our due"
"24466640","24472580"," diligence for, to say that's the anticipation and the expectation heading into the open and into"
"24472580","24473140"," the close tomorrow."
"24476370","24477150"," Yeah, you know what?"
"24477310","24478130"," That's a good point, Mary. "
"24478290","24479350"," I might have to take a Benadryl tonight."
"24479350","24482330"," I might have to take a Benadryl tonight."
"24484050","24484470"," That's right. "
"24484690","24487870"," Desperado snap up 50% to boom."
"24490230","24490550"," Boom."
"24492030","24492350"," Whoo. "
"24494750","24495190"," All right."
"24495230","24495870"," I'll see you guys tomorrow."
"24497150","24498170"," You guys have a great night. "
"24502210","24502530"," Wild."
"24507590","24508550"," Thank you for the tip, Chris."
"24508790","24509570"," Thank you for the tip, JB. "
"24510110","24510410"," Wow."
"24511790","24513010"," Thank you for the tip, Lucio."
"24513010","24514610"," I appreciate all the support. "
"24515110","24517290"," You guys all have a wonderful, wonderful night."
"24518530","24519690"," JB made money today."
"24527110","24528570"," You know, I used to take melatonin. "
"24533650","24534570"," Right on, right on."
"24534810","24535590"," I used to take melatonin."
"24536030","24536390"," Then I stopped. "
"24536610","24537410"," It was messing with me."
"24537730","24539010"," I was having really weird dreams."
"24540830","24542850"," But the Benadryl is banging. "
"24543150","24545710"," So I take Benadryl with me when I go backpacking."
"24546970","24550830"," Sometimes I go, like I go backpacking where there's like grizzlies and stuff."
"24550830","24552210"," And I spooked. "
"24552310","24552810"," I get spooked."
"24552910","24553730"," I get really, really scared."
"24560780","24562540"," I get really, really, I'll see all you guys later. "
"24563880","24565000"," What do I think we go up to?"
"24565460","24566980"," Well, I think we're getting close to 460."
"24571800","24574220"," The whole you guys are asking a bunch of questions and missing a bunch of stuff."
"24577000","24578360"," Yeah, melatonin I was taking that. "
"24578560","24580020"," Yeah, they're like technical dreams."
"24581360","24582420"," Like technical dreams."
"24584360","24585260"," Yes, Emerson. "
"24590970","24592510"," Yes, I want a list."
"24593370","24599250"," As a matter of fact, Emerson, can you DM me and that Kevin's alpha?"
"24599570","24600430"," Just ping me real quick."
"24601190","24602750"," I want to give you a phone call. "
"24605390","24608210"," I have a cenin who I haven't taken any of any of those."
"24610850","24612570"," I have a Genon Magnesium Theronite."
"24612770","24613950"," Ooh, there are three. "
"24614090","24614670"," Three on eight."
"24620340","24623500"," Yeah, I like Benadryl because I take it when I want to go backpacking."
"24624140","24625600"," And I get really scared out in the wilderness. "
"24626120","24629520"," Like I go backpacking and like Wyoming and the Tetons and stuff up in Montana."
"24629720","24630620"," It's very sketchy."
"24630940","24631700"," You can die up there. "
"24632480","24634260"," Do you think backpacking in Colorado is scary?"
"24634840","24637700"," You start backpacking up in Montana in Wyoming."
"24639860","24641500"," Like the southern Teton Mountains."
"24641980","24644360"," That's as scary as hiking up in Alaska. "
"24645440","24646920"," I did some hiking in Mexico too."
"24647000","24647780"," It's been kind of sketchy too."
"24653670","24654950"," You guys all have a wonderful night. "
"24656930","24657910"," Thanks Chris for the tip."
"24658030","24658610"," I appreciate it brother."
"24660310","24661190"," Thanks for the DM. "
