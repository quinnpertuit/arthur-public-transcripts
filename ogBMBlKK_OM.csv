"33590","131990"," Turn this thing off, GME, we're"
"131990","133090"," going to talk about GME today."
"143940","151880"," Use today and do."
"153780","155660"," I think that's enough. "
"160260","161360"," Just taking a guess."
"163360","216980"," I've got a couple of things"
"216980","217660"," I've got to do in the background."
"217800","220720"," I'm having some mornings I have technical difficulties. "
"223380","224900"," So what happens if you have a live show?"
"240130","241550"," You should be able to hear me now."
"244370","250690"," Some mornings I've got computers that want to change settings, that kind of stuff."
"251290","252170"," Good morning, everybody. "
"252650","254550"," We've got a few technical things I'm doing here in the background."
"254550","255450"," Just give me a second here."
"270720","271860"," Why is this not?"
"272480","279990"," All right, hot sauce. "
"280270","281730"," I'm starting to see y'all out there right now."
"282450","283070"," Good morning, everybody."
"283070","283870"," How's everybody doing?"
"284870","285970"," Happy Thursday. "
"291520","292880"," Phone's blowing up this morning."
"292880","303530"," Morning, everybody."
"303690","304530"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"308840","315940"," So I did take a chance here down below and I purchased, I added to my call position down here. "
"316100","317120"," So just the heads up to you."
"317460","323100"," Many of you were buying some strangles or straddles into the clothes yesterday."
"323340","327860"," I added to a position for today and for Friday down here. "
"327860","329600"," I did not buy any puts or anything like that."
"329700","332540"," We're going to talk about what to expect today."
"333280","334740"," We're going to take a quick look around the market. "
"338060","340640"," We got a low pin strike."
"341040","341880"," Let me show you this."
"343460","344980"," A bunch of stuff we'll get right now. "
"345240","351820"," We'll pause this book map for a second."
"354460","356940"," Let's start with the spy on its own."
"356940","357240"," Okay. "
"358940","362260"," So we've got the daily trigger way down here somewhere."
"362520","363700"," Let me see if I can find the daily trigger."
"365220","365860"," Come up. "
"366060","366760"," Comes up every day."
"368400","370260"," That four eighteen twenty four."
"370540","371740"," I think we talked about. "
"376970","378290"," That was the daily trigger."
"378590","379310"," We made a new one."
"381030","385450"," I think earlier in the week, we had said, you know, you expect the daily trigger to be at four"
"385450","388530"," sixteen on Monday and then four eighteen by later in the week. "
"389470","399010"," The good news for bulls is that as it comes up, it's like a shark from the deep."
"401530","406790"," So as every day passes, it comes up, steps up as time passes."
"407190","410910"," The more time that passes, there's a couple positives here. "
"411050","418510"," The more times that more time that passes, right?"
"419410","423170"," The more bullish it can be interpreted as when you see."
"425490","431290"," Large price movements to the downside one day down two days down three days down."
"431390","434610"," That's indicative of a volatile environment, right?"
"435450","440750"," We saw a lot of this in twenty twenty one, not twenty twenty. "
"441110","444530"," Excuse me, twenty twenty two, not twenty twenty three."
"446310","453090"," So long as we spend in the sideways range, even if we get some lower prices, long as we spend"
"453090","463950"," here, this is more indicative of market rotation, market digestion, buying"
"463950","465390"," the dip, believe it or not, right?"
"465510","467530"," We're not seeing massive downside moves."
"469130","473130"," We're not seeing liquidation events in the market. "
"473130","479390"," We actually saw liquidation of some of the top heavy tickers in Nasdaq yesterday."
"481950","483790"," So this is a good sign down here, right?"
"483950","485290"," One way or another, this is a good sign."
"488950","494770"," We know where the buyers, we think where the buyers and the sellers are, where we think the sellers"
"494770","496270"," are, we think the buyers are, right?"
"496870","498670"," I think the buyers are down here. "
"499390","501650"," So far, so far they've been down here, right?"
"501650","502870"," They bought the dip down here."
"503050","504290"," They bought the dip down here."
"505070","506330"," They bought the dip down here. "
"506750","510070"," They bought the dip this morning, right on this bar."
"510790","514090"," Looks like they bought it again on this bar right here."
"514350","519309"," So far, nothing says that support is still not, hold on here. "
"520530","523030"," That was a previous low, like a lower sum."
"530830","535190"," So far, nothing says that demand is still not here, right?"
"536390","542850"," The moment that we do trade under and begin to reject, we know that demand is gone."
"543390","546250"," We're likely going to clean up this big gap down here, right?"
"547170","548430"," We'll go back down here. "
"548570","550150"," I know the bears want this."
"550490","551470"," You know that I want this."
"552470","555230"," You know that ultimately for the move higher, that's what I want. "
"555230","557330"," I'm a cheap bull."
"558370","560810"," I like, oh, look at that, huh?"
"563270","569930"," Another note about where we are right now is this little note that I put in here this morning."
"570530","574910"," This is a zigzag bottom of the channel, no bueno below. "
"575750","577050"," And why does that matter?"
"586020","587640"," Why does this matter?"
"587640","590680"," We'll talk about why this little green bar right here matters."
"592160","593280"," That's the hourly trigger."
"593940","600340"," This is the price that I posted for you on FinTwit this morning, I said. "
"601180","602740"," This is the no-go right here."
"602920","612400"," Like right here, these sellers know that if you break above this, that's not quite right there."
"612520","615100"," It's more like right here. "
"616760","623820"," These sellers know, right, the sell side knows that if you break above this, you test this and you"
"623820","627480"," start to move higher, they're going to get run over."
"629000","631000"," And I mean run over."
"632800","634960"," You'll be trending for two days, right?"
"637020","643460"," And you also know here that Thursdays have a high probability. "
"643460","645020"," It's two points here."
"646040","650180"," Thursdays have a high probability of trending up."
"651420","658920"," What's fascinating is if we don't get a trend day on Thursday, that that probability goes to like"
"658920","660740"," 80 or 90% on Friday. "
"662560","667240"," So if you have a down Thursday, sideways, Thursday, Friday usually becomes explosive."
"667640","670280"," And I mean like 80% of the time, 90% of the time."
"671240","678080"," So even if you don't get your trend day on Thursday, and if it's ever down on Wednesday, look out"
"678080","678580"," to the upside. "
"683190","687010"," We also know that we've had a down week, right?"
"687650","689150"," We started out the week nice and high."
"689910","692690"," We hit the high range, I believe, in the weekly up here on Monday."
"694150","699110"," We kind of have not hit the low range on the weekly implied move to the down side this week"
"699110","699330"," yet. "
"701250","702890"," So we have that going on."
"703010","705310"," Then we also have the pin in the market, right?"
"705450","706110"," We know about the pin."
"706210","709670"," We've been talking about it nonstop since Monday. "
"710730","712930"," And where do we wind up ending the day?"
"713610","721290"," And this has a lot to do with huge options expiring this week."
"723890","730270"," And in this consolidation, you also have theta gang out there, piling in on this trade."
"733230","735590"," See for today, we got going on for today. "
"736230","736750"," Hold on here."
"738170","742210"," Of course, this isn't the OI on daily options."
"743890","747090"," We have a pin today at 427. "
"751800","759080"," And off the bell this morning, you've got sell side with 111,000."
"759080","762720"," And puts on 426."
"764940","772080"," So you can already see that these sellers do not want this market exploding to the upside, right?"
"775180","778220"," Now the structure of the market today is quite fascinating. "
"779700","789480"," All the five volume chart maturity has a giant concentration of calls"
"789480","790040"," and puts."
"790960","799660"," They got a giant concentration on 426 P and 427 C."
"802420","809760"," So I did wonder if we bounced around up and down all day long today without going too crazy."
"813260","817500"," Now all that shit being said, blah, blah, blah, got all that out of the way. "
"822580","825140"," What is fascinating here, this is the spy chart."
"825980","827720"," These are zigzag channels here."
"834260","841720"," This specific channel off of this daily here has been like clockwork. "
"841960","845720"," It's been like bottom of that channel."
"846260","850300"," But I want you to take note here that we were at the bottom of velocity, right?"
"851280","853860"," It's like a no brainer and we're on daily."
"855360","856660"," So you get this nice free trick. "
"856660","858700"," That's pretty sure we blast up, right?"
"858900","859600"," Rip it faces."
"860520","866720"," Another beautiful thing about this is right here."
"867920","870200"," See how we're rounding velocity to the upside?"
"872260","873660"," See our rounding velocity here. "
"875220","877260"," And we got a nice big fat dipped by velocity."
"877720","877980"," Looks great."
"879320","885660"," Then down here, you know, and you notice how we're on the bottom here of this zigzag. "
"885660","887620"," Zigzag chart the whole way."
"888800","889680"," Right here."
"890060","892080"," Regularly scheduled dip by boom. "
"892460","894200"," Regularly scheduled dip by boom."
"894840","897680"," It works until you do it until it breaks, right?"
"900400","902580"," Now this guy right here."
"904000","911440"," I bet in your mind you're like, well, we're regularly scheduled at the bottom of the channel of the"
"911440","912100"," zigzag chart. "
"912600","916160"," That's a little white box that I drew for you on the weebull chart."
"917340","919280"," Expectation is we're going to rip some faces off, right?"
"920920","926220"," The one issue that we have today is velocity is kind of light on the spy."
"927780","930720"," So do you temper your expectations for an upside move?"
"933520","944290"," Do you actually get not this"
"944290","950290"," right here, but like dupe, dupe, is that all you get?"
"952070","953630"," Velocity here is not on your side. "
"954030","956630"," Trend is not on your side to the upside."
"960310","961750"," So big question mark, right?"
"962350","974410"," So one thing we want to be paying attention to today is can we get above this hourly"
"974410","975150"," trigger?"
"976130","985370"," We know that if price and the one in five minute can get above and successfully retest that hourly"
"985370","988390"," trigger, we should get at least something out of that."
"989150","995250"," Even if we stay range bound, something out of that, we see it happen before, right?"
"995590","1000710"," Get above, boom, come back down, boom, and then boom to the upside, right?"
"1002490","1006850"," So we're at least kind of looking for something like that today to the upside. "
"1007530","1015730"," Now, something that's not on this chart that can help a bull out today, something not showing on"
"1015730","1016250"," this chart."
"1017090","1018050"," What is that?"
"1018590","1020510"," How do we get some help in spy?"
"1024109","1027250"," So I look around and I'm like, yeah, let's go take a look at the cues."
"1031690","1032609"," And look at that. "
"1034170","1037230"," The cues on a 30 minute chart."
"1038490","1040470"," Big old destruction yesterday."
"1042470","1044430"," And velocity is on their side. "
"1050750","1053530"," Velocity is on the cues side here."
"1056630","1058750"," Now here it is right now knocking, right?"
"1059010","1062130"," It's knocking on the door of the hourly trigger."
"1063190","1067310"," It is important for us to pay attention today to the cues. "
"1069070","1077530"," The cues just rejected off of $350.99. If the one minute and five minutes can carry on up"
"1077530","1087610"," to $351.01, then price can get over $351.01. It"
"1087610","1091670"," will lend a helping hand to the S&P 500."
"1093170","1099590"," So $351.01. Oh, yeah, baby."
"1105400","1107780"," $351.01. Here's the cues. "
"1109040","1111160"," What do the cues need to do?"
"1112320","1113800"," Just set it to you, right?"
"1119400","1124100"," $351.01, right where we are."
"1127840","1130340"," Put your cues on a five minute chart."
"1132580","1134200"," It's a five minute chart in the cues. "
"1137280","1151720"," If the cues can get over $351.01 up here"
"1151720","1161640"," and you watch if the white line and the red line come up, it will provide the"
"1161640","1169940"," needed trend day that you're looking for on the S&P 500."
"1176320","1179880"," Pay attention to this all day long today."
"1194690","1200020"," Pay attention on the S&P 500 to the hourly trigger. "
"1202340","1205320"," Pay attention to this white line right here."
"1206140","1207920"," Price needs to stay up there."
"1215630","1220990"," And any retest needs to be defended on that white line. "
"1222190","1226250"," To get the reversal here, this needs to take place right here."
"1232430","1237950"," The last thing that's on your side is that rotation and two other sectors."
"1239530","1241530"," Then you'll get your trend day. "
"1242290","1243450"," Don't worry about this pivot."
"1244370","1246250"," Don't worry about this yellow line and that kind of stuff."
"1246650","1251770"," You're only worried about this stuff right here for today. "
"1253870","1255470"," This interplay right here."
"1256170","1258230"," This is going to be your deciding factor."
"1258610","1259890"," I will assure you of something. "
"1260850","1263110"," There is a rejection up here at any point."
"1264070","1265750"," Start running this shit down."
"1265890","1267130"," This shit starts rolling over. "
"1267890","1272890"," We're going to flip to the bare side and start taking this market down into Thursday and Friday."
"1277080","1280980"," So we know that the S&P 500 does not have velocity on its side."
"1281180","1284700"," We know that we need some help from tech. "
"1295580","1296600"," Sounds good, pop."
"1297400","1303080"," So we're here waiting and seeing all more in line."
"1303080","1304920"," We're going to wait and see what happens here. "
"1306740","1308640"," We're going to talk about GME today."
"1309680","1318740"," We're going to talk about GME, but we're also going to talk about how many chances do we have to"
"1318740","1321540"," hit that JPM caller the month of June."
"1322440","1326140"," I was watching, what was I watching last night?"
"1326580","1327500"," I was looking to see where I was watching. "
"1327680","1329220"," I put on Bob Kendall last night."
"1330500","1332620"," I haven't had a chance to watch him in some time."
"1333380","1336740"," And then Mike De Silva I watched last night. "
"1338640","1340800"," I haven't had a chance to watch YouTube in a long time."
"1341120","1341820"," So I was like, you know what?"
"1341940","1345680"," I got some free time going to get on YouTube and check out some of my favorite people."
"1345800","1349720"," I did not get a chance to finish Larry Williams last night. "
"1349860","1351740"," Those are kind of like three guys that I like to watch out there."
"1352960","1356820"," Figuring out money, Mike De Silva had a great comment about seasonality."
"1360120","1361040"," Seasonality charts. "
"1361100","1368760"," If we're in an election year, we tend to roll over in June into late June in non-election years."
"1369940","1370840"," June is strong."
"1371340","1380880"," We know that also July has a very strong first week, first second week of July tends to be"
"1380880","1381560"," strong. "
"1382920","1390120"," We are seeing the rotation trade right now, which is kind of like a key pointer in the background."
"1390840","1392860"," We know about the rotation trade going on."
"1393260","1396380"," We know that if we did not get the rotation trade. "
"1396620","1398540"," The operation with China is likely to grow."
"1400620","1404840"," We know that if we did not get, we know that if we were exiting tech, right?"
"1406000","1410580"," And we were trying to jump into, let's say, oil, utilities."
"1411400","1412880"," Mid caps, small caps. "
"1414180","1415380"," There's a bunch of others, right?"
"1415480","1416800"," We're talking about them for weeks now, right?"
"1417120","1422220"," We're rotating into some of the unloved sectors of the stock market."
"1422240","1423220"," We didn't see that rotation."
"1424020","1431540"," If we saw no rotation in just the exiting of the stock market, we'd be looking for that down end"
"1431540","1432040"," of June. "
"1433520","1434880"," We haven't seen it, right?"
"1435700","1436620"," We haven't seen it in the breath."
"1436840","1438740"," We've seen the rotation is what we've seen."
"1440280","1444120"," We've seen a bid in some of the unloved sectors. "
"1445140","1448120"," So it is leaning towards what Mike Silva is saying."
"1448860","1451240"," On the prior of 110 BCF."
"1453900","1459760"," So do we only get the one opportunity in June, and we come back in July and make that next"
"1459760","1460220"," step?"
"1461080","1465280"," Do we consolidate for that move higher in later June or early July?"
"1466680","1471820"," So far nothing's saying that there's fear in that rotation trade. "
"1478950","1486010"," He's figuring out money to then get you their videos from yesterday."
"1487050","1489270"," I'll get Mike Silva's for you specifically."
"1493480","1495060"," You guys want to watch that?"
"1499760","1500960"," Here's his video. "
"1502180","1503960"," I liked watching his video last night."
"1511840","1514680"," He made some very good points on seasonality."
"1515220","1518580"," He reminds me of a, I posted a comment in his video last night. "
"1519080","1521800"," It reminds me of a young Larry Williams."
"1522220","1524900"," He is a great command of stockcharts.com."
"1525540","1526820"," And I don't."
"1527020","1527300"," I've tried. "
"1527580","1531940"," I'm like, man, to me, stockcharts is like a thinkorswim."
"1532400","1536600"," You get absorbed into it and you're part of the system or you're not."
"1538440","1540320"," And I'm not a part of that system. "
"1540800","1543920"," I dabble in stockcharts.com, but I'm not a part of the system."
"1544540","1545260"," A complete ecosystem."
"1545940","1546400"," And he is. "
"1546860","1548380"," So I like to refer to him."
"1548500","1555020"," He seems like he's always seemed to me like he's done a great job of navigating stockcharts.com."
"1573280","1575460"," All about watching what happens here."
"1575680","1576520"," Time, baby. "
"1577000","1579100"," Time, time, time."
"1596290","1598030"," Look at Tesla this morning."
"1598330","1599890"," Just trucking along, baby. "
"1600170","1601090"," Two, two, Tesla."
"1602730","1604930"," It's a nice rotation trade, isn't it?"
"1608110","1609530"," IWM finding its legs."
"1613890","1616130"," Dixie selling off to the depths of hell. "
"1619130","1621390"," Vix at the bottom of its channel."
"1624490","1626150"," We'll see if we can murder the Vix."
"1636560","1637880"," Tell you what I have on my calls. "
"1638140","1639000"," My calls are green."
"1641260","1645520"," I stated earlier when I began the broadcast that I bought this bar down here."
"1646360","1647720"," I added to my position. "
"1649460","1650160"," Go back."
"1650340","1653080"," If you want to pause the program, go back and start it again."
"1653720","1657680"," Kind of early into it right now so you can put it on speedplay. "
"1658460","1661760"," And if you start at the beginning of the video, I start right at the beginning and talk about my"
"1661760","1662120"," positioning."
"1672380","1673420"," Successful retest."
"1675580","1678180"," Full plane forming on the S&P 500. "
"1680920","1685860"," All the tech zero date call buyers wanting to come out for Thursday and Friday for a move to the"
"1685860","1686140"," upside."
"1686460","1689660"," This is not asking anyone to choose between the US and China."
"1696660","1698540"," Yeah, I don't think personally. "
"1699460","1702280"," So my view is not the same as Mike's."
"1702600","1703640"," I agree with him."
"1705000","1708300"," My view here is that you don't have a lot of time. "
"1708640","1715860"," So in five minutes time now we do EIA natural gas change forecast 115 BCF on the 110 BCF."
"1716440","1719680"," My view here is I want you guys to be very clear in this."
"1721200","1724180"," My view is not the same as a lot of people out there. "
"1724440","1726100"," That's not a bad thing or a good thing."
"1726540","1731800"," I try to try to do my own due diligence and figure out what I think is going to happen."
"1732020","1734400"," I consume other stuff from other people. "
"1734600","1739300"," But for me, I'm trying to gauge my opinion against people that I trust."
"1740920","1742600"," And I trust Mike even now."
"1742780","1743540"," And I like this video. "
"1743740","1747760"," That's why I put the video in there for you to take a look at that."
"1747760","1749600"," To get that insight from him."
"1749840","1751200"," It's someone that I trust out there. "
"1751780","1760680"," And the reason why I watched that video last night is because, in my view, next week, we opened the"
"1760680","1764180"," door to some volatility, real volatility in the marketplace."
"1766000","1771800"," And I know a lot of my friends that are very smart traders, like these are people that don't do"
"1771800","1772220"," what I do."
"1772560","1773440"," I trade dumb, right?"
"1773720","1774200"," I'm a dumb trader. "
"1775860","1779950"," I try not to overcomplicate things."
"1779950","1787350"," When I tried to be an intelligent trader, I lost more money than when I dumbed it down."
"1787650","1792770"," The more simplified I made my trading life, the easier it was for me to make money. "
"1794130","1803350"," When I tried to overcomplicate trading and investing, when I drank Kool-Aid, all that stuff, I"
"1803350","1806350"," began to lose hemorrhage money over time."
"1810740","1815880"," Now, but my smart friends that are great traders, these are guys that have got great degrees."
"1816840","1818780"," They've worked for prestigious institutions. "
"1820540","1825720"," Those guys are betting on next week having some volatility."
"1826980","1834260"," They're selling puts down below for this week, and they're buying puts up on high for next week."
"1835780","1837880"," So they don't think there's a crash this week. "
"1838280","1840180"," They don't think we're getting majored down this week."
"1841040","1842580"," But they're betting on it next week."
"1842880","1845840"," So in my view, you only got two days. "
"1846920","1848860"," Basically, I have two days to get up there."
"1849600","1851460"," You don't get up there this week, right?"
"1851620","1853220"," Today or tomorrow, that JPM caller."
"1853580","1856940"," I don't see it happening next week. "
"1858020","1862320"," Maybe we get some good news or something from that economic calendar."
"1862320","1864740"," But the market is betting against it."
"1864820","1870220"," The smarter people out there are betting on volatility next week. "
"1874310","1876810"," And most of these guys get it right most of the time."
"1877550","1881330"," These aren't like Finn Twitters that are, you know, they don't know what they're doing."
"1881450","1882250"," These are guys that I trust. "
"1882390","1884290"," These are guys that I've been making."
"1884490","1885590"," They're living for many, many years."
"1889160","1892400"," And they're not betting on it this week, but they say, yeah, next week, man. "
"1893000","1893940"," Next week, it's on."
"1896080","1899920"," So if you're a bull, you basically have like two more days."
"1900160","1901140"," You got today and you got tomorrow. "
"1901980","1904420"," Next week, I'd be watching your asses."
"1905220","1909180"," If you're a bull, if you're like a buy side out there, just hang tight and relax."
"1909420","1910220"," Look for a dip to buy. "
"1914100","1916660"," So we'll take a look at a couple of things."
"1916840","1918460"," We're going to take a look at one thing here."
"1918720","1920780"," We'll take a look at the economic calendar for next week first. "
"1929590","1930870"," So today is the eighth, right?"
"1933790","1940730"," This morning eight 30 claims came in at two 61 forecast was two thirty six."
"1942170","1943670"," Previous was two thirty three."
"1943830","1944310"," Good job. "
"1944490","1945690"," Jerome doing a good job."
"1947350","1953250"," I was almost going to make a joke this morning that before the four eight 30 this morning, I was"
"1953250","1960850"," going to make a joke that that I was going to file for a jobless claim this morning."
"1960850","1962310"," To get the numbers pumped up. "
"1962610","1964030"," But I guess I didn't have to do that."
"1964210","1965110"," They already did it for me."
"1970320","1971700"," So the market would go up. "
"1974860","1976200"," Now in the 12th."
"1978540","1979780"," We have nothing scheduled."
"1980140","1980420"," That's Monday. "
"1982740","1985680"," On Tuesday though, that's that's Monday right on Tuesday at eight thirty."
"1985820","1988240"," You've got a CPI core CPI."
"1988240","1990220"," We got CPI year over year. "
"1990980","1992180"," And the core year over year."
"1992800","1993280"," That's all."
"1994960","1995440"," Wednesday. "
"1996260","1997700"," You've got PPI at eight thirty, right?"
"1997900","1999860"," We got core PPI over year over year."
"2000040","2000500"," Over year."
"2000740","2001740"," Over year. "
"2002780","2006100"," The four cast of a hundred and fifteen BCF."
"2006440","2007520"," We also have."
"2009300","2018900"," It's just that great decision on Wednesday the 14th at two p.m. We got the chair pal presser at"
"2018900","2024100"," two thirty p.m. Now if we've seen rotation and now liquidation. "
"2026640","2027340"," That's right."
"2027580","2030740"," You watching that right now you dirty dirty dirty dogs out there."
"2032600","2033720"," If you've got. "
"2034740","2037780"," A rate decision coming out on Wednesday of next week."
"2038840","2041100"," And you know volatility is coming in the next week."
"2041100","2044480"," And you haven't seen selling by rotation. "
"2047500","2049880"," They ain't got a lot of time to get up there."
"2050600","2052100"," It's the phrase they want to be."
"2052239","2055540"," It takes right takes right allows you need to get up there. "
"2055880","2058080"," So if we've got all next week."
"2058860","2059880"," They can be absorbed."
"2060659","2063980"," There's no institutional buying that wants to see us at. "
"2064320","2067480"," There's no institutional buying that's buying at four twenty seven."
"2068639","2070679"," That's like yeah I'm going to buy four twenty seven."
"2070860","2071800"," Hey Bob what are you doing?"
"2071800","2073179"," We're going to buy four twenty seven. "
"2073580","2075460"," We want it to go down to four hundred."
"2075840","2080060"," And then if the rates are bad for it to go down to four ten fuck it."
"2080440","2081159"," Four hundred. "
"2082380","2083980"," So that's what you're seeing right here."
"2084239","2086800"," Seeing that big old push up there."
"2105700","2109140"," My zero dates are printing like a motherfucker right now by the way. "
"2111000","2116270"," About the fuck out of this bar down here."
"2131680","2135380"," So you know when you're looking at all this as a whole right."
"2135800","2137180"," A whole right. "
"2137740","2140740"," And then Thursday we got we we have after the rate decision."
"2141480","2148400"," We have claimed initial claims retail sales import price index empire manufacturing."
"2148400","2149520"," Really fed. "
"2151920","2154900"," Pass a utilization business inventories."
"2155740","2159840"," And then Friday of course we have consumer sentiment."
"2160500","2161940"," Do you have a full docket next week?"
"2162880","2163460"," We got vol. "
"2165560","2168320"," And you know what happens when we have vol right."
"2169260","2171720"," They fucking front run it to the upside typically."
"2176040","2179000"," So when I make a post on fin to it and I say to you. "
"2179000","2182560"," Not you but if I say it specifically to a new trader hey look."
"2182840","2184480"," You only got like one more chance."
"2185880","2188220"," The next chance is likely in July right. "
"2188440","2191280"," So if we have one more push up into next week's volatility."
"2192680","2193820"," Then we get some vol."
"2195500","2202600"," And then you get your push up into July right up down up down up down. "
"2211340","2212800"," Right in here you see it."
"2225550","2226550"," This was demand."
"2229430","2230030"," Right. "
"2231890","2233470"," Demand pushing up there."
"2235890","2240490"," And here you get some traffic these are the young Jim bros."
"2241030","2243170"," These are the big Jim bros up here. "
"2262100","2264060"," We got the hidden tick up here."
"2267610","2269830"," We have the hourly trigger."
"2270890","2272570"," The one minute the five minute. "
"2274850","2276270"," The bull plane."
"2279510","2283650"," Squeeze on up squeeze on up squeeze on up."
"2284650","2286250"," Confirmation boom. "
"2287350","2291050"," Coming back down now to test the hourly trigger."
"2292870","2295170"," The one minute in the five minute."
"2296950","2298550"," The one in the five minute. "
"2299570","2302190"," If price holds on the hourly."
"2304010","2306630"," Is a three trigger bull cluster."
"2309290","2310990"," Pay attention to this. "
"2313750","2315210"," See what happens here."
"2317950","2323890"," U.S. natural gas teachers ease after the E.I. reports a slightly bigger than expected storage build"
"2323890","2325070"," last down 1%."
"2333300","2339560"," So they did report a build on the actual storage but however a draw on the forecast. "
"2340440","2350500"," Nasdaq is coming into 14,421.79. 14 "
"2350500","2351220",",421."
"2352820","2358820"," Scratch that .70. Keep your eyes on that target right there."
"2359980","2364320"," Could get a quick reversal to the downside on the spooze. "
"2399920","2403000"," We're looking for some help from below on NDX here."
"2403740","2406040"," NDX is tech if you don't know that."
"2408940","2412220"," We have a reversal to the downside on VIX. "
"2413700","2415980"," Trading 13.92 baby."
"2416560","2466540"," 13.89. I haven't"
"2466540","2468160"," had a chance to read the comments yet."
"2468480","2468900"," I apologize. "
"2470120","2472100"," Let's talk about GME really quick."
"2476840","2478740"," Because I'll be honest with you."
"2479300","2481020"," I know parts of it. "
"2481020","2483920"," But I don't know all of it."
"2485860","2491680"," And I'm fascinated by James Rowland yesterday posed the question late night."
"2492880","2499040"," And it was a Ryan Cohen tweet that said not for long, right?"
"2499280","2499760"," Like for long. "
"2500020","2502040"," I think he's a previous CEO or whatever."
"2508800","2511600"," So Ryan furlong out there."
"2512480","2518700"," Well, forget furlong, but Ryan Cohen is the interim or temporary or big questions surrounding him"
"2518700","2519460"," becoming the CEO. "
"2522000","2526780"," So my big question is about GME."
"2527240","2533700"," And it's fascinating because when you're a GME bull or bear or buyer or seller, I don't care who"
"2533700","2534000"," you are."
"2534720","2537300"," You're usually inside the fish tank, right?"
"2538160","2540900"," You're not outside the fish tank or inside the fish tank. "
"2540900","2542480"," There's that quick drop down below."
"2544300","2546280"," Let's see the red bar that I put there for you."
"2553080","2561320"," I want to see what the interplay is down here at 14,360 on NDX. "
"2561320","2564200"," I want to see if it gets a nice squeeze higher here or not."
"2568270","2569310"," So let me know in the chat."
"2569530","2570890"," So I haven't read any of the chat yet this morning. "
"2571230","2572450"," But I've got the chat up right now."
"2572990","2574310"," I had a hard time getting the chat up too."
"2574310","2580030"," So just let me know in the chat right now what you know, what you think about GME. "
"2581410","2584750"," And so James Rowland posted that last night."
"2584870","2586750"," And then when he posted that, I read some of the comments."
"2587430","2591390"," Then I went to the tweet from Ryan Cohen and read all those comments. "
"2592450","2595170"," And then I went into a super stonk on Reddit."
"2596190","2600450"," And read their top one or two posts on the subject yesterday."
"2601090","2602910"," And I was kind of with James Rowland. "
"2603850","2606190"," The answers were, you know, lots of shit posting."
"2606710","2608550"," Lots of, I don't know what the fuck is going on."
"2609510","2610490"," And I'm on the outside. "
"2610830","2613250"," I try to keep myself on the outside of stuff like Tesla."
"2613710","2616090"," I used to get like, I used to know too much about this shit."
"2616770","2618130"," And I try not to anymore. "
"2618870","2621790"," So that I can have the outside of the fishbowl looking in."
"2623590","2623990"," Opinion."
"2624990","2628510"," And not be too negative, not to be too positive at any of these companies. "
"2629470","2633730"," And what I posted to James Rowland last night was M&A."
"2634410","2635170"," Mergers and acquisitions."
"2636310","2638110"," Before I read any of that stuff. "
"2638850","2641330"," And then I went to some of these posts."
"2641810","2642790"," And then I went to super stonk."
"2642850","2648030"," And some of the most highly posted comments and replies were mergers and acquisitions. "
"2649930","2653030"," And so I was like, ah, some of the smartest stuff."
"2655310","2660310"," Or some of the smartest answers are percolating to the top mergers and acquisitions."
"2662290","2670830"," And that's what my take is on this is if you look back in time in 2022 and 2021. "
"2671810","2679350"," If you just Google search for yourself games, if you're inside the fishbowl, scrub your brain for a"
"2679350","2679550"," minute."
"2680710","2685630"," And just search game stop mergers and acquisitions."
"2686390","2692030"," And you'll find a lot of old articles that discuss the probability or possibility of that. "
"2692210","2700250"," Now that being said, I fear for game stop if that does happen."
"2701090","2706090"," My fear for game stop would be they would hammer the price down as low as possible."
"2708490","2712350"," To try to sell it at a price behind closed doors. "
"2713930","2716990"," Now, of course, likely game stop will benefit from that, right?"
"2717150","2717990"," That the stock will."
"2718250","2721470"," But price will matter if that happens."
"2722310","2727410"," So first, I guess first question to you is, do you think the door is open to a merger or"
"2727410","2727770"," an acquisition?"
"2728230","2729190"," Let's just call it an acquisition. "
"2729830","2731770"," Or my view, I think acquisition."
"2732990","2739940"," Yeah, what if GME is the acquire?"
"2741000","2742860"," Yeah, I saw the Teddy comments yesterday."
"2744940","2747940"," I think it'll be I think the name is worth something. "
"2748240","2750000"," I mean, there's there's some value in the name."
"2751840","2754020"," Personally, I'm disappointed in GME."
"2757120","2760820"," The fact that they haven't just like it's an easy. "
"2761620","2762880"," It's an easy correlation."
"2762880","2764140"," If you look at."
"2765720","2766560"," It's an easy correlation. "
"2766960","2770140"," If you look at Blockbuster Video, right?"
"2770440","2773900"," Netflix, you must adjust, right?"
"2774680","2779780"," I saw people in Superstomp last night and they were like, they're going to repackage their old"

"9486970","9489090"," I didn't catch this down here."
"9489290","9489970"," I'm so angry."
"9492230","9493890"," That was it right there, man. "
"9494190","9495050"," That was the one."
"9495270","9496890"," I'm over here, sticking around on tech."
"9496890","9501010"," And I totally missed that pin strike down there. "
"9502510","9504130"," I'm so pissed right now."
"9505930","9508170"," That was the sauce right there."
"9508290","9509030"," That was the strike. "
"9509370","9511190"," That happens very rarely."
"9512490","9513310"," Then I would miss that."
"9514610","9516270"," I was over here fucking around. "
"9516490","9518210"," I'm like, do, do, do, do."
"9518210","9519290"," We're going to take a look at India X."
"9519530","9522010"," Do, do, do, do, do, do, do."
"9525950","9528850"," So that raises the real question about this report. "
"9531090","9537130"," And his understanding is that Mali has not met the Iran ambassador in a couple of months."
"9656330","9682370"," U.S."

"9720270","9720950"," I got Winky here."
"9721070","9722110"," Winky's in the background here. "
"9722830","9723590"," Get us ahead of Winky."
"9740740","9745240"," All right, got Nasdaq rolling over going back to check 1445 460."
"9746200","9751280"," If any of you are looking for a dip buy, if you missed the dip buy earlier today, I missed"
"9751280","9751860"," one of them. "
"9753200","9754960"," I had calls from yesterday."
"9755440","9756960"," I added to my position on the open."
"9757300","9757860"," Took some profit. "
"9758280","9760380"," And then I was looking for a dip buy right here."
"9760520","9763420"," And I was dicking around trying to talk to you guys about Nasdaq."
"9763580","9764400"," So I missed the trade. "
"9764700","9766400"," The second leg I missed."
"9767340","9768180"," Caught all this."
"9769560","9771180"," Missed this one right here. "
"9772020","9775860"," So I'm a little disappointed in myself because, of course, that's money in my pocket."
"9777640","9779220"," On a trend day, but that's fine."
"9779980","9781020"," That shit happens. "
"9782140","9785120"," But I'm looking for another dip buy, believe it or not."
"9785240","9786400"," We're not done here."
"9787120","9789480"," If you think we're done here, I don't think that we are. "
"9791300","9796620"," So if you're in the stream right now, I apologize for not chatting the entire day today."
"9797440","9802240"," So we're going to look at, is there another dip buy in here?"
"9806360","9807580"," Are we done?"
"9809380","9813280"," I bet you the, I bet you the sellers are like, please, please be done."
"9815280","9816960"," Question becomes, are we done?"
"9817460","9818500"," I don't know if we're done. "
"9818680","9819480"," I know one thing."
"9825100","9828780"," I know that this is a natural place to take profit, right?"
"9829960","9831900"," Here's spy right now."
"9833300","9836780"," We know that profit taking half is happening here, right?"
"9837040","9838860"," One, two, three. "
"9840620","9843320"," We know that if you're buying the dips down below, right?"
"9845080","9846040"," Consolidation, right?"
"9846780","9851640"," Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam."
"9853000","9860180"," We know that we don't sell this market until we break below, confirm the leg lower."
"9861080","9869420"," We don't enter any of this shit unless we squeeze up and confirm the move higher. "
"9870060","9871720"," Haven't seen that yet, have we?"
"9872860","9875060"," Haven't seen this yet, have we?"
"9876860","9882400"," So far it's been, buy the dip, sell the rip, buy the dip, sell the rip, buy the dip, sell"
"9882400","9883000"," the rip."
"9883940","9888920"," So the question becomes, are we going to get the actual push through the upside?"
"9890320","9891800"," I bet everybody wants to know."
"9895400","9898680"," So do we actually break out finally?"
"9900200","9902620"," Question of the day, I guarantee it is. "
"9904760","9909660"," I know for a fact that sellers are like, oh fuck no cap, we're going right back down here again."
"9911160","9914700"," So the question becomes, are we going down?"
"9918240","9920060"," Hmm, we got to find out, right?"
"9920200","9920940"," How do we find out?"
"9923120","9924280"," Well, we need help."
"9927960","9932840"," And earlier this morning I was telling you that we didn't have the velocity from spy to push us up"
"9932840","9933160"," and over. "
"9934120","9939800"," It's not in our favor right now, but you know what did have the velocity this morning was NASDAQ."
"9944870","9946890"," NASDAQ can get us up and over."
"9949150","9954890"," So we want to see what happens right in here. "
"9963860","9968440"," NASDAQ can take us for a ride to the upside."
"9968440","9976800"," So we're going to pay attention to this, keep our eyes on this, just see what's going on down here."
"9980040","9983100"," Still paying attention, still watching NASDAQ here. "
"9984600","9986980"," It's a big feat to accomplish, right?"
"9987500","9989000"," Pause all this stuff up here above."
"9999840","10002780"," Everybody wants to know, do you break out?"
"10004820","10007660"," Do you go to Valhalla?"
"10011340","10019830"," Do you go to the famed JPM caller?"
"10021630","10023270"," Is it today?"
"10024090","10025750"," Is it tomorrow?"
"10027150","10029690"," We only have one day left."
"10044550","10046060"," Big question here. "
"10046540","10049280"," Three times rejected."
"10052320","10057980"," Right now, people are just loading short and puts right now."
"10062340","10063920"," They're like Gandalf. "
"10064380","10065680"," You shall not pass."
"10069880","10074120"," I think it's a 4-3-2-6."
"10075200","10076520"," I think it was 4-3-2-0. "
"10076820","10077520"," Am I wrong on that?"
"10077900","10080740"," I thought it was 4-3-2-0 and then somebody updated it and said 6."
"10081340","10082140"," Maybe wrong on that."
"10082680","10083420"," Don't quote me on that."
"10085820","10088500"," So when you're trying to get up there, think about this for a minute. "
"10088600","10090120"," I want you guys to think forward."
"10090760","10094060"," I want you to think forward, right?"
"10094320","10094860"," Think in the future."
"10096680","10098740"," We only have until the 30th. "
"10100000","10101860"," We normally trade above it."
"10103340","10106120"," We have a bunch of volatility next week."
"10107280","10108920"," So do we get there at the end of the month?"
"10110000","10112320"," Or do we try to get up there right now?"
"10112320","10115620"," So if we come back down, we can get back to it and kind of get all weird. "
"10117040","10118760"," So I don't know what the answer is here."
"10118860","10120020"," I want to know from you in the chat."
"10120200","10121480"," I want you to tell me in the chat. "
"10126320","10128720"," Do we get there between now and tomorrow?"
"10133860","10136100"," Because this is the safe trade right here, right?"
"10136620","10138560"," Safe trade is cut your calls."
"10140340","10142420"," Wait for Nasdaq to tell you the way."
"10147100","10149060"," You don't want to trade any of this, do you?"
"10150060","10152800"," You want to wait until you break above. "
"10153700","10155900"," I want to know from you in the chat what you think."
"10156120","10159680"," So right in here is no-go zone, right?"
"10160060","10160780"," We know that, right?"
"10161640","10162540"," We just looked at it."
"10163640","10164580"," This is volatility. "
"10165400","10168040"," You don't trade this long, do you, as a bull."
"10168620","10171100"," You wait until we break above what?"
"10172220","10172700"," 430."
"10174920","10177080"," Consolidate for the move higher to the JPM caller. "
"10177780","10179820"," This is your no-go zone as a bull, right?"
"10184770","10189050"," But I want to know from you three times you've been up here."
"10189870","10191610"," Do you think now is the time?"
"10192270","10193690"," Do you think it's tomorrow?"
"10195030","10197550"," Do you think it's the next two weeks from now?"
"10197550","10203090"," Do you think it's the Fed rate decision that will send us up there?"
"10203670","10208550"," Do you think we won't pin it or trade above it until end of month?"
"10209650","10214810"," Do you think that we won't touch it?"
"10214950","10220230"," It's now acting as not a magnet any longer because we're getting close to the end of the caller,"
"10220530","10224150"," that it's repelling, and we're going to trade away from it and down."
"10224410","10225230"," We're not even going to tag it. "
"10226030","10228110"," Tell me what you think in the future."
"10237010","10239130"," Getting some good answers out there right now."
"10245600","10247020"," IWM is begging for some love. "
"10247400","10248160"," Dow chilling at high."
"10248480","10249820"," Now it's trying to find some bulls."
"10250820","10254340"," To me, I'm seeing this is a relief pop and more down. "
"10254580","10255140"," Now more downside."
"10255620","10255860"," Good answer."
"10256040","10256500"," I like that one. "
"10259000","10262160"," Mr. Talking Monkey is saying 427 is the magnet."
"10262440","10263920"," I agree with that statement too, right?"
"10263920","10266700"," We know that the max pain today is 427."
"10269000","10271540"," We know that the magnet is right in here, right?"
"10274640","10275920"," The hourly trigger. "
"10278060","10279080"," Let's get rid of these."
"10279420","10281220"," You guys already know what this all this stuff means."
"10283100","10285460"," So Mr. Who said the magnet was that 427?"
"10285940","10291000"," So Mr. Talking Monkey is saying magnet is right here to the close today. "
"10291760","10294300"," You see us rolling over."
"10294980","10299120"," Come down to check the five minute."
"10300360","10303600"," And then check this one down here, right?"
"10304980","10305540"," Bam. "
"10316820","10317580"," Hold on."
"10317700","10318220"," I'm missing stuff."
"10319380","10320060"," Hold on. "
"10320160","10320920"," I'm missing a bunch of stuff."
"10325030","10326910"," Hell yeah, YWV."
"10327550","10333100"," I'm going to give him a call right now. "
"10333200","10334220"," Give me like five seconds."
"10334220","10335120"," I'm going to try to give him a shout."
"10339280","10341040"," Seeing the roll up here. "
"10341460","10341500"," Bam."
"10341980","10342900"," Bam, right?"
"10343120","10346040"," In total, roughly two billion dollars in user funds."
"10346520","10347100"," Target here. "
"10347260","10347840"," Target here."
"10348600","10353540"," You've got Mr. Talking Monkey saying we've got a magnet on the close to 427."
"10356660","10358460"," What else did you guys say in here?"
"10359220","10361160"," Excel, you just blasted off. "
"10361480","10362420"," Where is the caller again?"
"10363060","10369640"," I think it was 4320, but someone I've been to it a month or two months ago was like, oh,"
"10369640","10371540"," no, it's more like 432 or something."
"10371680","10372280"," I was like, all right, whatever."
"10372500","10372720"," Fuck it. "
"10375680","10379500"," Yeah, 4320 for June 30th."
"10380540","10381120"," It's a prayer."
"10381220","10384580"," Three is saying CPI plus FMC next week prediction is vol next week. "
"10384720","10385720"," I am on that trade."
"10385820","10388440"," I agree with you that we get volatility next week."
"10388560","10389600"," I agree 100%. "
"10389600","10393040"," Whether the people like it or not, we're getting a volatility downside trade next week."
"10393620","10394700"," I'm with you on that trade."
"10397040","10400500"," I don't think it has much effect on price this far ahead of expiry. "
"10401460","10408020"," So normally we tag that before we get to the end of the month or the end of the quarter."
"10408920","10412360"," We'll typically tag it early and then repel away from it."
"10412780","10419000"," So I am fascinated by people saying that we should tag it on the 30th. "
"10420000","10421400"," I'm fascinated by that answer."
"10421960","10429100"," I don't know what you mean by when you say JPM caller."
"10429400","10431360"," That's another conversation that takes like a half an hour. "
"10431380","10433480"," We can't have it right now, but I will have it with you again in the future."
"10433600","10434820"," I do review it every once in a while."
"10435400","10437300"," I'm just happy we aren't pinned at 4.12 anymore. "
"10437600","10438180"," That's a good mister."
"10438440","10439120"," Good job, mister."
"10439320","10439960"," I like that answer. "
"10441680","10444500"," I'm happy that we're not pinned at 4.12 anymore."
"10445940","10447500"," We're now trading the 20s."
"10448600","10450340"," I agree with you on that, mister. "
"10452280","10456140"," Everybody is waiting for the caller, so my answer is that we get close, but no cigar."
"10456840","10458920"," Yeah, bear town sheriff, I like your answer too."
"10459120","10465500"," So the one thing that bothers me is everyone is focused on that 4, 3, 2, 0."
"10465500","10470200"," So when everybody's focused on it, they're like, oh shit, we're going there. "
"10470440","10471540"," So they trade to it."
"10473700","10478420"," If you know we're going to 3,200, if you know we're going to 3,500, if you know we're"
"10478420","10482740"," going to 4,000, if you know we're going to 5,000, we fucking trade there, right?"
"10482880","10484220"," It's like everybody with the bulls, the bears."
"10484600","10485500"," Everybody knows we're going there. "
"10485620","10486880"," We typically do trade there."
"10488100","10489020"," It's a fair point."
"10491260","10494120"," He's also making a good point too in what he's statement saying. "
"10494740","10498200"," We'll like trade near it, but never get to it because of that."
"10498740","10502700"," That's like when Elon calls like 4, 20, and we only trade to 4, 18, right?"
"10503460","10506240"," Then they short the fuck out of it, and you get smoked."
"10510500","10512080"," It sells calls, buys puts. "
"10512420","10518440"," If you want to know exactly what that trade is, the trade is called a bearish seagull."
"10518440","10521720"," And you can just look it up on Investopedia."
"10522240","10524760"," You can look it up on options industry council. "
"10525080","10526420"," That's the structure of the trade."
"10531400","10534200"," We have some really weird structure in the market today."
"10534360","10542020"," We have calls and puts that are like, it's like 4, 35, I think, and then like really, really low. "
"10542420","10546360"," And I was wondering if we'd get a wild swing up and down today due to it."
"10548760","10550620"," Like I forget what it was yesterday."
"10551660","10555620"," Like today's call, like the actual call structure is really wonky today. "
"10563200","10564660"," I'm fascinated to know."
"10564960","10569460"," I'm fascinated here to know the reason why I'm fascinated is because we've been up here three"
"10569460","10570260"," times, right?"
"10571740","10573840"," One of these times we're going to break through."
"10574040","10575000"," Maybe not the first time. "
"10575120","10576340"," Maybe not the second time."
"10576340","10581000"," You kind of expect, are we going to do this or not?"
"10582860","10585140"," You've had a lot of accumulation this week, right?"
"10585800","10587880"," You've had a whole week to consolidate."
"10589540","10591660"," You've had an entire week here. "
"10593020","10594300"," We have not sold."
"10596380","10600060"," You have demand, have demand, have demand, have demand, have demand."
"10602820","10604620"," Do we actually go?"
"10608480","10614060"," If we didn't have this demand here and we started rolling down for real support. "
"10616580","10625240"," So I guess that's my question is, if all these buyers are truly here, are we going up the Valhalla"
"10625240","10626000"," up there?"
"10630860","10632840"," And I haven't looked at SPX yet today."
"10633780","10634880"," I'm going to look at SPX in the background."
"10691420","10693380"," Sorry, I'm talking to somebody in the background. "
"10693880","10701440"," So my point here is, do we actually go up on the third try?"
"10702140","10707060"," How many licks on a lollipop does it take to get to Valhalla?"
"10707560","10716880"," If we know that there's volatility next week, we know the market's going to come back down."
"10716880","10720580"," Are you telling me that we go down next week and then eventually get up there?"
"10721780","10729180"," Do they take us there before next week and then whenever Vol there is brings us back down?"
"10732220","10735140"," Oh, does sentiment change before we get up there?"
"10741100","10742500"," Trying it again, huh?"
"10745300","10747960"," Trying to break out again, huh?"
"10747960","10748340"," Huh?"
"10751660","10752020"," Interesting."
"10756620","10758860"," Trying it out one more time, huh?"
"10761660","10765170"," Looking forward, huh?"
"10767330","10769130"," Get some volatility next week. "
"10770690","10772750"," Let's have a look at the SPX."
"10779390","10781050"," We got going on up there."
"10781150","10782550"," Where's that SPX caller?"
"10804780","10806100"," Let's see what I'm looking at here. "
"10806240","10807080"," What am I looking at here?"
"10807180","10808440"," I'm looking at what do I got up there?"
"10808520","10808660"," What do I got up there?"
"10808660","10809400"," What do I got up here?"
"10810040","10811700"," 4, 3, 2, 0."
"10812120","10813120"," 4, 3, 2, 0, huh?"
"10817060","10818440"," 4, 3, 2, 0."
"10821220","10822360"," 4, 29 is Normandy."
"10823180","10825140"," Get every Normandy looking at a Range Rover's."
"10825600","10826920"," I think we're going back to all-time highs. "
"10827100","10828940"," I'm 6% along with 8% protection through August."
"10829180","10829440"," Rest cash."
"10830120","10830820"," We got a fat pitch. "
"10831280","10831340"," Yeah."
"10832360","10833580"," Yeah, I was long in October."
"10834060","10838060"," I'm on the train too. "
"10838360","10839840"," As long as we don't break trend."
"10842160","10843160"," I'll show you guys some."
"10844280","10852800"," As long as we don't break trend, I'm on the train to at least at a minimum. "
"10854540","10856000"," Closing all the gaps up and high."
"10856160","10856520"," Excuse me."
"10857060","10858400"," Closing all the gaps up and high. "
"10858860","10864160"," And if we go to all-time highs, that resets the entire market, right?"
"10864380","10865560"," If we go to all-time highs, we reset."
"10865840","10871340"," So in every wake off scenario or two wake off scenarios, we close all the gaps."
"10871720","10873420"," This is the most bearish scenario. "
"10874160","10875840"," We close all the gaps up and high."
"10876220","10878580"," We roll over and it gets pretty ugly."
"10879040","10879300"," Not ugly. "
"10880160","10881400"," The lows should be like 3,200."
"10883960","10886240"," Well, excuse me."
"10886500","10887760"," Today it would be 3,200. "
"10888080","10892340"," If we failed the trend, today it would be like, I think it's like 3,200."
"10893540","10900700"," It's like any kind of a wake off scenario, a wack off scenario, something like that."
"10900800","10902820"," If we fail to close those gaps, roll down. "
"10903920","10910280"," We'll actually have, our bottom will actually be, like I think in my view, it'll be like 3,200."
"10911140","10915800"," If we do the resets, we go to all-time highs, then you're not going to see a major role"
"10915800","10916520"," for many years."
"10922260","10923940"," We should talk about that right now. "
"10924680","10926960"," Sometimes I talk about that and sometimes I don't."
"10928100","10930840"," I was asked about it a few days ago, three or four days ago."
"10931000","10935740"," So it is a good time for us to talk about this while this thing decides what it wants to"
"10935740","10935900"," do. "
"10937580","10940640"," We've got NASDAQ right now coming back to test."
"10942200","10944140"," NASDAQ is testing its bull cross."
"10945220","10946160"," We'll see if it holds. "
"10946560","10951080"," If it does not hold, start getting bearish."
"10953140","10958280"," So right now, if you're looking at NDX on your own chart at home in a five minute chart with"
"10958280","10959560"," a, what am I using today?"
"10960220","10965060"," Today I'm using a, what am I using?"
"10969160","10976220"," Today I'm using an EMA 30 and an EMA 129 on a five minute chart."
"10978720","10983460"," So if you want to put that on a five minute chart on NDX at home, this is going to"
"10983460","10984540"," be your check right now. "
"10987220","10997100"," This is going to tell you if we rip to the upside"
"10997100","10997800"," or not."
"11001160","11005040"," I have a neutral alert right now on the back end."
"11005760","11008300"," I want you to pay attention right now. "
"11008300","11015140"," I want you and your own to pay attention to an NDX and that cross and see what happens."
"11015220","11022020"," If you get a positive reaction to the upside, we might just start squeezing higher."
"11025160","11026540"," Now I want to show you guys something cool. "
"11030430","11031750"," So three times, right?"
"11031930","11033490"," You guys, this is the third time, right guys?"
"11037050","11038830"," I want to see if we roll here or not."
"11038830","11039390"," I'm interested."
"11048270","11051550"," Okay, on spy, let me spin close. "
"11051870","11054850"," I got a dump bunch of this shit and just make it nice and clean."
"11055690","11056310"," We're going to get spies."
"11056710","11057510"," This happens, okay?"
"11058670","11061190"," So I'm going to get you off this right now. "
"11061330","11062930"," You should already have this charted at home."
"11063070","11066170"," You should already have this stuff ready to go for yourselves."
"11070760","11072400"," Don't be screaming at me in the chat. "
"11073760","11075480"," You should already have all this stuff at home."
"11082690","11086430"," Someone was asking me about this recently and I wanted to talk about it again."
"11088810","11092350"," I'm going to point something out to you. "
"11096300","11098360"," I'm going to point something out to you."
"11100620","11106280"," I want to show you a, put it on one day so make it easier."
"11112750","11115710"," I want to show you normalized markets, okay?"
"11116190","11117570"," What a normalized market looks like. "
"11121000","11122220"," This is 2020."
"11122620","11123300"," It doesn't really matter."
"11123480","11133580"," What matters is, what really matters here is price, daily"
"11133580","11143300"," trigger, weekly trigger, monthly trigger, very key points, very"
"11143300","11148240"," key points, price, daily trigger, weekly trigger, monthly trigger. "
"11149000","11158760"," When price is above the daily, the daily is above the weekly and the weekly"
"11158760","11164960"," is above the monthly, we are in normalized markets."
"11167100","11171680"," Every time, going all the way back to 1895."
"11175080","11175880"," All the way back. "
"11176760","11177860"," Way back."
"11179560","11183040"," Price, daily trigger, weekly trigger, monthly trigger."
"11183760","11185020"," All the way back to the beginning. "
"11186620","11190440"," That's what it looks like."
"11191640","11192880"," You can see it."
"11194600","11196700"," Price yellow orange blue. "
"11199600","11200440"," Nope."
"11201920","11203740"," Price yellow orange blue."
"11205280","11207300"," Price yellow orange blue. "
"11208280","11209880"," There's something else you can take away from this."
"11211220","11217740"," The more expansion we get between these three, the more volatility can happen."
"11218860","11220900"," Some fascinating is happening right now. "
"11221440","11223560"," It has not happened in some time."
"11224040","11227220"," Some time has passed and look what is happening."
"11231950","11240510"," We are getting, finally, price, above the daily. "
"11242170","11247090"," The daily above the weekly, the daily, the weekly above the monthly."
"11248050","11250910"," Does that mean we can't come down here and test the weekly?"
"11251210","11256050"," Nope, we do actually do that in a normalized market."
"11257190","11263370"," But as long as price stays above the daily and even believe it or not, the weekly and the more"
"11263370","11277700"," fascinating part is, the more fascinating part is, as long as price, that's"
"11277700","11278660"," orange, but I want yellow. "
"11282340","11286320"," Not price, as long as the daily trigger isn't crossing down here."
"11289660","11294860"," As long as the orange is down here and the blue and all this nonsense isn't happening."
"11295520","11297000"," Look, that kind of bullshit down there. "
"11298420","11300060"," And price isn't below it."
"11304140","11305700"," That's not a normal market."
"11306660","11308340"," That's a volatile market. "
"11310020","11313140"," That's, that's the expect all kinds of fucked up shit to happen."
"11314800","11318400"," But this right here."
"11320560","11322940"," And you know what the fascinating part about this is?"
"11324120","11331960"," Every single time this has happened, it lasts for like six to nine months at minimum. "
"11335180","11335860"," Minimum."
"11338340","11343300"," So when people are out there and they're telling you things like the stock market's going to crash,"
"11344500","11352220"," this run is over, this is a blow off top, this won't last."
"11353840","11356160"," They were right back here. "
"11358440","11362380"," Possible back here, definitely happening back here."
"11363460","11365180"," Definitely happening over here."
"11365720","11368840"," Greed hundred percent, greed, greed, definitely a greed, definitely a grief. "
"11369340","11379160"," And what's fascinating is, you see it happen way back here in January and February."
"11380320","11381780"," So you kind of get a warning, right?"
"11382220","11383260"," Time to get a warning."
"11383860","11387180"," Remember though, that shit ran for like a year back there. "
"11388060","11389640"," And we had huge expansion."
"11392220","11400000"," So right now where we are at this moment is normalization of markets."
"11400600","11401100"," Why did it happen?"
"11401560","11402360"," More than likely time. "
"11403780","11407080"," The greatest trick that Jerome Powell pulled sideways and down."
"11409180","11410960"," No one likes to talk about time."
"11412980","11414020"," Sideways in time. "
"11418880","11419760"," Makes a difference."
"11424700","11436730"," So if you want to know why I get so confident in the direction of the stock market, there's"
"11436730","11438070"," the simple answer for you."
"11438350","11439110"," Pretty simple, right?"
"11439310","11441670"," Couple crayons, there you go, there you go, there you go. "
"11444050","11449950"," Now there's some other indicators that are not on that chart that I showed you, that actually show"
"11449950","11455870"," in the background when they're selling, and the price is still up."
"11457190","11461050"," It shows you in the background, it just goes, it actually starts to decrease."
"11462850","11467390"," And you can see the money leaving the market, and the price is still going up, and the price is"
"11467390","11468030"," still going up. "
"11473410","11477150"," You'll get that tool from me, so that you can time it."
"11479030","11483150"," You're going to be able to look at that tool and go, Hey Cap, it's happening brother."
"11484230","11485150"," And I'll go shoot. "
"11489660","11492100"," They're leaving the market and the price is still going up."
"11499450","11500190"," You're right."
"11514910","11518590"," Powell, that's the best way that you can describe it. "
"11518590","11522810"," Powell pulled a bull playing on the market quietly."
"11524590","11531060"," He quietly did the greatest trick that they pulled."
"11532540","11536320"," Even if we could roll right now, we could roll right over here. "
"11537780","11543520"," And as long as we catch that weekly, that market is still on."
"11545700","11548920"," And even in those bull markets, we do hit that weekly."
"11549480","11552800"," Every quarter or so, every two quarters will hit that orange line. "
"11553480","11555840"," But we still continue higher and to the right."
"11556660","11561920"," So for right now, we are not in collapse mode."
"11563340","11567840"," Now if that shit changes, we'll know if it changes, right?"
"11568000","11568680"," We'll see it happen. "
"11569640","11570840"," And then we'll call a crash over here."
"11573500","11577180"," And the most fascinating part of it was time."
"11578920","11581240"," I don't know if it was the banks in the Fed. "
"11581340","11582500"," Some of it was the banks, I think."
"11583660","11587040"," The Fed used to be a very secretive thing."
"11588340","11590800"," They would pull some surprise shit on you. "
"11590920","11595960"," They'd be like, surprise motherfucker, right in a Senate hearing."
"11596800","11597660"," They'd be like, fuck you."
"11598120","11599280"," And he'd be like, oh shit. "
"11600400","11603620"," You guys remember back in the first pot meme stock days?"
"11604280","11610840"," And the Jerome Powell was in the Senate or some shit, and Trump was freaking out publicly."
"11611720","11616600"," I think he was long in the market, and the market just fucking ripped faces to the depths of hell."
"11618040","11622580"," So Jerome Powell and the Fed used to have a mantra of they would tell you what to expect. "
"11624180","11625980"," And they would see what the market was doing."
"11626460","11628380"," And then they would just throw a monkey wrench in."
"11628700","11629860"," Up or down didn't matter. "
"11630000","11631640"," They would just totally fuck your position."
"11631640","11635640"," And then when COVID came, he changed his tune."
"11636220","11643140"," He was actually in a press conference and said, you will never, or at least right now, you'll never"
"11643140","11644800"," again have that from us. "
"11644800","11647480"," We'll never be as secretive as we once were."
"11648160","11652900"," So, according to the Wall Street Journal, Biden says, as supply chains continue to unsnail company"
"11652900","11658240"," profit margins fall from historically high levels, rents continue to moderate inflation should"
"11658240","11658980"," decline further."
"11658980","11667020"," And so what the fascinating part of that was from that point forward, Jerome gave you forward"
"11667020","11669060"," guidance before he made a decision. "
"11669420","11675100"," So when we look at COVID and then there after he always warned you, he's like, hey, you're getting"
"11675100","11676140"," 25 VPS."
"11676280","11677320"," Hey, you're getting 50 BPS."
"11678220","11682040"," Matter of fact, he was like, expect a rate increases in the fall, right?"
"11682220","11682800"," He told you that. "
"11683780","11691860"," So in December of 2020, banks began to divest themselves of spec growth."
"11692640","11695060"," It didn't show itself everywhere in the market."
"11695160","11699780"," And raising revenue from the wealthy Americans and at largest corporations. "
"11701300","11704900"," So the bear market actually began in December of 2020."
"11706640","11712780"," It began a long time ago."
"11712780","11715460"," It began farther back in time on spec growth. "
"11716320","11721960"," And then once they got to the S&P 500, we saw it in 2022, right?"
"11722120","11723220"," You're like, oh, shit, we're going down."
"11723940","11728340"," And right now, we're like, hey, let's get a, let's get a last leg to the depths of hell."
"11728600","11729400"," Like, let's just do it. "
"11730140","11736420"," Mike Wilson, I mean, I disagree with Mike Wilson, but he had a fair point."
"11737280","11739540"," Let's get it over with, like, rip the bandaid off."
"11739740","11741000"," Let's plunge to the depths of hell. "
"11741680","11743500"," We were all on board with that, right?"
"11743680","11748520"," We see the regional bank crisis come into play and we're all like, yeah, that's it."
"11748640","11749320"," That's the one, dude."
"11749420","11750080"," That's going to be the one. "
"11750160","11750980"," We're going to fucking do it."
"11751800","11757900"," Hopefully we're going to crash all these, build these bullshit, uh, office park, bullshit loans and"
"11757900","11759120"," all that stuff in the summertime."
"11759700","11762440"," We're going to, we're going to clean house and all these regional banks. "
"11764060","11768820"," And instead what they said was, well, we're just going to clean out each sector one by one."
"11768820","11772000"," And we're going to support them along the way and you go, fuck."
"11774320","11774840"," Shoot. "
"11776600","11781540"," So as we're looking for that last leg cut in the S&P 500, what they're doing behind the scenes"
"11781540","11788840"," is instead of cutting all four legs off, they're cutting like one leg off, repairing it and then"
"11788840","11794180"," cutting off another leg and then repairing it in the background."
"11795740","11796700"," That's what they're doing."
"11803940","11805520"," And why have they been doing this?"
"11805960","11808560"," It's been what, how much time has passed December of 2020. "
"11809600","11814100"," So what I've been doing this, the stock market has either been getting its legs cut off."
"11814500","11816920"," And then you see the spy trading down in sideways."
"11819660","11823220"," And they're buying time that that is the soft landing. "
"11823340","11824280"," The soft landing."
"11825240","11826020"," Is where."
"11826820","11829240"," This giant shark from underneath. "
"11830280","11833900"," That had like a, like an elastic band that's been stretched."
"11835220","11836860"," Because time is passing."
"11837940","11841400"," All those elastic bands are coming back together again. "
"11844720","11851260"," So you start to, like you're, like, like when we're in the middle of 2022, I'm like, I'm like, oh,"
"11851420","11851980"," yeah, right now."
"11852680","11854900"," I've got like a 15% chance."
"11854900","11859440"," We like, I don't think they had like a 5% chance of going down to like three 16. "
"11860680","11865300"," And like 320 was like, that's like 15, 20% chance as time passes."
"11866100","11868480"," Your expectations for down moves."
"11870240","11871740"," It's become softened. "
"11877590","11882930"," All of this stretch in price is then coming back in on itself."
"11886670","11887870"," Greatest trick they pulled."
"11889190","11889670"," Sideways. "
"11891270","11892590"," Kind of shocked at that."
"11892730","11893910"," I wasn't expecting that."
"11895550","11896970"," It threw me for a loop. "
"11897190","11900230"," I was like, I was on like team."
"11900550","11901450"," We're fucked here."
"11902470","11905770"," And then it's time passed and time passed and time passed. "
"11906470","11908330"," I'm watching all this happen in the background."
"11908630","11910910"," And I'm like, these motherfuckers are going to, they're going to trade it sideways."
"11912190","11913110"," That's what they're going to do. "
"11913590","11915070"," I'm going to trade this shit sideways."
"11918650","11922790"," The longer they trade it sideways, the less damaging it becomes."
"11924050","11926170"," Now if there's fraud, that's not the case. "
"11927310","11930050"," If you believe in fraud, then I understand that."
"11930410","11932910"," You're like, hey, man, the system's got too much fraud in it."
"11933370","11935070"," That's what I liked about Mike Barry. "
"11935230","11938250"," Mike Barry was like, that's the one key that I liked about Mike Barry's."
"11938310","11939470"," He was like, there was fraud in the system."
"11940910","11942670"," That's how he got his second leg down. "
"11945510","11948470"," If he didn't have that fraud in the system, he would have been fucked."
"11949930","11950990"," We would have kept going up."
"11964690","11966790"," 104 counter-marties take two spot one. "
"11966870","11967970"," Yeah, it's data-gaying, man."
"11968150","11968730"," It's really crazy."
"11969030","11969490"," That's re-population. "
"11972990","11974650"," Do I believe they'll be successful?"
"11975030","11975350"," I don't know."
"11975550","11977110"," I don't care if they are or they aren't."
"11977790","11979190"," I'll trade it all the way down there. "
"11979350","11980170"," I'll trade it all the way up."
"11981890","11982710"," I don't care."
"11982910","11983710"," I don't care what happens. "
"11986610","11987830"," But I think it's fascinating."
"11988330","11989830"," I think it'll be looked at down the road."
"11989910","11993270"," I think in like 10, 20 years, it'll be studied. "
"11999360","12002580"," I think you can take something away from that lesson as well."
"12004940","12014440"," And that is that I would not expect the Fed to crank open the money supply and"
"12014440","12016720"," slam it shut in the future."
"12018120","12020220"," I think you're going to get a Fed that's more. "
"12021800","12024920"," We support and we need to to keep the market trading naturally."
"12026320","12031440"," But like the cocaine, the cocaine nose job is likely gone for some period of time."
"12035580","12039940"," If you're, or if you're, if you're expecting that market, I guess, if you're expecting like the,"
"12040580","12046620"," the cocaine once again, I think you should be tampering or dampening your expectations of that. "
"12049890","12052970"," I think they want to get back into the business cycle."
"12054950","12061510"," The short and long term debt cycles and let those play back out more naturally, if possible."
"12062190","12063590"," I hope that they do that. "
"12065170","12066750"," I would appreciate that."
"12066910","12067630"," I was talking to Winky."
"12067630","12071490"," Winky was talking to me and he was like, he's like, I'm fucking tired of this. "
"12072210","12073550"," He's like, I don't like this anymore."
"12073790","12074450"," He's not having fun."
"12074650","12075630"," I don't care when it goes up. "
"12076170","12077610"," Joe Donut said the same thing."
"12081650","12083470"," Like no one likes the ride anymore."
"12086170","12087830"," No one that I know likes the ride. "
"12088830","12091030"," They don't like even the bears."
"12091590","12094630"," Bears, bears I know are like, I like when it's regular."
"12095030","12096630"," I come in the, I come in in in the middle of the month. "
"12096630","12099830"," They sell the market down and make money, pops back up."
"12099970","12103690"," I come in once a quarter and I get a really deep sell off."
"12104770","12109070"," Bulls are like, I can buy Tyson Foods and not look at it for a few years. "
"12110190","12112750"," I got bulls are like, I don't want to buy Tyson Foods and my crash."
"12113050","12113570"," And I'm like, really?"
"12115150","12120950"," And some of that is, some of that is the, or the, the, the trauma that's been done to a"
"12120950","12122390"," lot of long time market participants."
"12123100","12124570"," I think in focus. "
"12126090","12130690"," The last five years or so have become very rough."
"12132390","12134490"," For a long time market participants."
"12137270","12141290"," If you speak, if you speak to long time market participants. "
"12142470","12148670"," That remember 2000 and 2008, they didn't participate in 2020."
"12148850","12149690"," Do you guys know that?"
"12150250","12152210"," A lot of long time market participants."
"12154030","12155070"," Stayed out of the market. "
"12156150","12159450"," They're like, if you ask those guys, they'll be like, I remember 2000."
"12160290","12163470"," I remember 2008 and I'm not fucking going through that again."
"12170170","12171470"," Yeah, there was a lot of damage. "
"12171810","12174110"," There were a lot of people that stayed out of that trade."
"12175930","12180650"," I was just, I was just, we had a long weekend at a long conversation where."
"12182090","12183550"," He was like, I'm out of the market. "
"12184390","12185230"," And I was like, why?"
"12185570","12188250"," And he said, I can't, he's nothing."
"12188490","12188870"," He can't."
"12188930","12190330"," He doesn't want to deal with. "
"12192730","12194350"," The wildness of the market."
"12198180","12199740"," Yeah, it's become like a playground."
"12201620","12203900"," Playground for, you know, short sell or. "
"12204720","12208940"," Short sellers for a lot of fucking, what do they call volatility as an asset class."
"12210220","12211720"," Yeah, it's become playground for."
"12213580","12215440"," Not retailers trading zero dates. "
"12216340","12217480"," But institutions, right?"
"12220200","12222840"," Institutional wild, you know, wild west shit, right?"
"12223440","12224540"," It's not us doing this."
"12224780","12228740"," And Biden says who will keep pushing for tax reforms to reduce the deficit."
"12229880","12231220"," It was crazy in 20. "
"12231440","12233400"," So when we rolled over in 2022."
"12234080","12238680"," People are like, I'll see people on social media say, we're really weird shit."
"12238700","12241440"," They're like, oh, it's the rise of the retail trader or. "
"12242240","12244340"," It's all these bulls trading zero dates."
"12244340","12245280"," I'm like, that's not true."
"12245280","12247380"," That shit's been on the rise steady rise. "
"12248760","12249980"," For like 10 years."
"12251180","12255800"," And the most glaring I've ever seen of it, most glaring I've ever seen."
"12257200","12259360"," Was the down move in 2022. "
"12261100","12264380"," I've never seen that many puts come in on a zero day chain."
"12264920","12267560"," And I ever have in that time period."
"12268420","12270320"," So if you want to like blame bulls or retailers. "
"12271440","12271920"," It wasn't us."
"12274420","12276500"," It most definitely was not us."
"12276880","12279120"," This was a very smart. "
"12281140","12283940"," Algorithm driven hedge funds doing it."
"12289850","12291030"," Dealers are doing it."
"12293910","12295190"," Banks are doing it. "
"12295550","12296330"," It's not you and I."
"12301550","12302470"," You're welcome."
"12305270","12306750"," Yeah, it's rolling right now."
"12306750","12308270"," I'm going to put some puts on here. "
"12308510","12308770"," Hold on."
"12321060","12322580"," Thanks for the heads up on NDX."
"12328690","12329870"," I'm watching it right now. "
"12355040","12356920"," Got some 427 P's here."
"12374230","12376770"," So yeah, so when you're looking at this market, right?"
"12380830","12383430"," Be careful about the market crash."
"12385950","12390670"," Scenario if you're looking for the market crash scenario, there's a lot of work to get there. "
"12391890","12395630"," There's like five or six trades that need to happen."
"12397850","12403030"," Like there's like one, two, three, four, five trades that need to happen for the crash to begin"
"12403030","12403310"," again."
"12409310","12415290"," And the market needs to lose a bunch of velocity on multiple timeframes. "
"12415870","12417950"," There was this week."
"12423660","12428900"," I haven't talked about this with anyone because I have to watch it over course of time."
"12429900","12434420"," But this week was the first week since December. "
"12438040","12440460"," I don't know if I should say this because I don't want to panic anybody."
"12445000","12447100"," Because it would still take some time to play out."
"12447180","12448280"," It could take like one to three months. "
"12450860","12460800"," But this is the first week of the first month of the first of this year where"
"12462310","12463270"," we're starting out."
"12464350","12466090"," Not getting a bunch of highs."
"12467650","12474170"," So if we close this month out down on the weekly monthly in daily, it'll be the first sign of"
"12474170","12475010"," a possible role. "
"12475630","12478850"," But that would still take like three months to six months to play out."
"12478850","12480770"," This is the first week that I've seen it."
"12486190","12492170"," So in the background, not on live stream in the background, I'm watching this in the background to"
"12492170","12492390"," see. "
"12496690","12500210"," This would be the first week, first month of the year."
"12502150","12506950"," So I have a huge fascination with how do we close out this week?"
"12508690","12510910"," And how do we close out June?"
"12512510","12517630"," Like this week and June to me are going to be for me."
"12517770","12520230"," I don't know what you guys watch, but I'm watching those two things. "
"12526900","12528480"," Perry man, I appreciate it."
"12529380","12531800"," I want you to know a couple things."
"12532160","12534600"," Please like and please thanks for that Perry. "
"12535040","12535840"," So a few things."
"12538020","12541000"," I appreciate just a couple things I want to talk to you guys about."
"12541740","12543020"," If you're a poor trader. "

"13853420","13861520"," Yeah, that's pretty close, white boyfriend."
"13861520","13862940"," Just get out right there, man."
"13863860","13865240"," It's a good tag right there. "
"13865360","13865520"," Right?"
"13865620","13866420"," My cursor is right there."
"13866480","13866940"," There's a good tag."
"13872600","13873600"," Can I go over Tesla?"
"13873980","13874800"," Fuck yeah, I can. "
"13880120","13882740"," Tesla price target below 228 26."
"13893530","13894530"," Can I go over Tesla?"
"13898690","13900770"," It's getting a little long in the tooth right now."
"13900850","13901650"," It needs a pullback. "
"13904730","13905790"," Let's take a look at it."
"13908010","13909070"," Can it go higher?"
"13909570","13912930"," Yes, it needs to the next trade for Tesla."
"13912990","13915150"," So Tesla's take the profit and run right now. "
"13919820","13923340"," It needs time for the hourly to catch back up with it."
"13924240","13925960"," The hourly is not there right now."
"13926080","13927340"," The hourly needs to catch up. "
"13927440","13932200"," It's like you can put, you can take along here with short with stops directly underneath it."
"13932960","13940560"," Like you can take some, you can put a long right now in Tesla at 228 26."
"13941520","13942840"," Let me take the price on it. "
"13946340","13947300"," Let's scratch that."
"13949620","13950580"," 222 80."
"13951140","13956460"," The problem here is that you need, like between here and 222, you need some consolidation. "
"13957580","13960220"," Tesla needs some consolidation, but it's breakout."
"13960720","13963360"," It's next breakout, believe it or not, is 300."
"13964840","13967080"," Like the next move for Tesla is 300. "
"13967660","13970020"," So it's going to take some consolidating."
"13971720","13976780"," The daily trigger right now, or the daily velocity right now is really toppy."
"13977560","13980880"," And the hourly velocity is kind of cooling off right now on Tesla. "
"13982900","13986720"," But your next leg up, man, like we are at the bottom of the key to go to the top"
"13986720","13989340"," of the key to 300 right now."
"13991160","13998060"," So it's going to be a difficult, I would say to you, a call spread here, or a call spread"
"13998060","14006940"," from 222 to 216 with some time on it with a price target right now of two or 300, dude."
"14008040","14011960"," And do the crazy part is the longer that it takes, the higher it'll be. "
"14012760","14015980"," If it takes like two months, you're fucking going to see 350."
"14017220","14020260"," If it takes like a week or two, 300."
"14021260","14026060"," It's the longer that we sit there, the longer that it takes. "
"14026440","14027720"," Nice little trade right there, right?"
"14027860","14028860"," That's pretty nice, wasn't it?"
"14029600","14030200"," Pretty good trade."
"14031720","14037120"," Give me looking for a trade higher and then more confirmation for more down to go."
"14046160","14047200"," Hey, you're welcome, guys. "
"14050740","14052260"," Yeah, we're going to validate this."
"14052260","14057960"," What we're going to do is we're going to validate this, um, this bear plane here."
"14058180","14058420"," We should. "
"14060320","14061980"," Not always, but we should."
"14062120","14062940"," We should go up here."
"14064280","14064940"," Squeeze up. "
"14065780","14068620"," Then we'll validate if this bear plane is legit."
"14087460","14088280"," Thanks, pinky."
"14088340","14089220"," I appreciate that, brother. "
"14095100","14096540"," Timing your trades."
"14100680","14105700"," Taking the money and running hit squad."
"14116590","14117870"," Good question. "
"14118050","14121010"," Dark helmet 46 is asking, do I think of reversals possible?"
"14122150","14126790"," I'm not going to take a long unless I see."
"14128970","14130030"," This happen."
"14146560","14148340"," Right there, I would take a long. "
"14151420","14152940"," You want to watch it play out?"
"14158040","14162520"," If this plays out, I will enter a long right there."
"14164100","14164840"," I will not."
"14165080","14167480"," Well, I will sometimes I'll trade this in a one minute chart. "
"14168780","14173480"," I'll take a call trade right here, but I used to do this shit on stream, but people get all"
"14173480","14173980"," fucked up."
"14174140","14174860"," They don't know what they're doing."
"14175060","14178120"," So I don't fuck with this anymore on stream with you guys. "
"14179240","14182640"," But this is for like a very you have to be like, you'd be like, fast as fuck."
"14183520","14186460"," If you don't understand what I'm doing right now, then don't even bother."
"14190860","14193200"," Because you can get the trap right here. "
"14195220","14199360"," There's a trap right here and there's a trap over here for bulls."
"14199840","14201260"," There's three traps here, so."
"14203480","14206800"," You need to like escape this trap escape that trap. "
"14207540","14209800"," Come back down here and then escape that trap."
"14211180","14212320"," One, two, three."
"14215200","14220540"," If you see that play out and you're in a short position, then you see the escape of those three"
"14220540","14220860"," traps. "
"14221660","14223180"," Fucking cut your shit."
"14223720","14224700"," Get out of there."
"14225920","14226400"," Run. "
"14227480","14234040"," Yeah, this is not where you buy for this is not where you buy calls."
"14234800","14236720"," This is a big mistake bulls make."
"14237160","14238600"," They buy this shit right here. "
"14239140","14239420"," No go."
"14240540","14241500"," Fuck no."
"14242340","14253850"," I mean, you"
"14253850","14254170"," can. "
"14255470","14257070"," Like you can trade that."
"14257770","14261730"," But you got to be like boom, I bought the tick boom, I sold the tick."
"14262250","14264890"," Like you got to be fast as fuck like boom, I'm in boom. "
"14265070","14266990"," I'm out on a one minute chart."
"14267590","14270810"," But dude, we used to do that shit in here and people would be like."
"14271430","14273430"," They would buy the second or third tick. "
"14273670","14278050"," They'd be trying to sell the last two or three ticks as it was already rolling over."
"14278250","14279630"," They'd be like, I'm in for 10 cents."
"14280170","14281230"," He's in for five. "
"14282530","14285370"," He's exiting at 10 cents, 15 cents."
"14286410","14288570"," It already rolled over on 10 or 15 cents."
"14288810","14289970"," I'm now back down to five. "
"14290790","14294710"," Pull the trigger, pull the second trigger and then I'm getting fucking torched."
"14294990","14297330"," Do that like 20 times and you're all fucked up."
"14297990","14300710"," So no, we don't trade that anymore here. "
"14303350","14307130"," If you're a bull, you're just looking for the setup, man."
"14307370","14308410"," You're like looking for this."
"14308490","14309190"," You look at that. "
"14309890","14310850"," You're looking for that."
"14311030","14312850"," You're looking for this step and over here."
"14313090","14315630"," No, I'm doing that all wrong, but you get me right. "
"14316190","14317170"," Look at that."
"14318230","14318470"," This."
"14319610","14322150"," Oh, and the confirmation. "
"14323350","14325090"," And that's the trade you take right there."
"14326870","14327930"," That'll be a trend."
"14328930","14329890"," That's sustainable. "
"14335570","14337030"," Nice little trade in there, right?"
"14337270","14338850"," It was fucking sexy little beast right there."
"14338930","14340510"," You see that little fucking thing right there."
"14340750","14340830"," Bam. "
"14347070","14350510"," It's like boiler room, Carmel and Harlem Globetrotter shit."
"14353990","14358350"," Now, if you're a bear, if you're a sell side, you take that trade, you get out of it."
"14359110","14359550"," Chaching. "
"14364850","14365930"," Pocket that money."
"14368690","14372830"," As this runs up, you're looking for a failure."
"14374710","14377590"," One, two failure and you set the trade up right there. "
"14379390","14380650"," You have it ready to go."
"14380650","14390640"," Yeah, it'll tag."
"14390740","14394360"," It'll tag this here and then maybe pull back up and then tag down there. "
"14395460","14397180"," And what you're looking for in here, right?"
"14397480","14399620"," Is you should have, you should have a screener open with the VIX."
"14401380","14403820"," You should be like, hey, the VIX needs to hold right now."
"14403940","14405240"," So right now the VIX needs to hold. "
"14407900","14408300"," 1366."
"14410940","14419860"," It needs to start trading to 14.05. You want to be looking around the market like, oh, did HYG"
"14419860","14420660"," just found a bottom?"
"14421800","14423120"," VIX is finding resistance."
"14424240","14426520"," Fucking Tesla buyers stepping in right now. "
"14427420","14429520"," So would I take this trade right now as a bear?"
"14429760","14430140"," Fuck no."
"14430900","14433820"," I want to see red candles here now."
"14434520","14435480"," At least one or two. "
"14436980","14439040"," And I want to see a new low right here too."
"14443730","14444890"," And I'm watching the clock."
"14444890","14446770"," It's 157 right now. "
"14446910","14447610"," Three minutes left."
"14448430","14450170"," Bears need a new low right now."
"14450390","14451030"," Right now they do. "
"14451670","14453870"," You can tag this little bad boy right down here."
"14454150","14455670"," It's a little sweetheart down here."
"14455770","14457290"," Maybe even this one right here would be nice too. "
"14462080","14464040"," These sellers are here right now, definitely."
"14474480","14479480"," Another note to you is if you're a bull, if you get one leg down, you should get at least"
"14479480","14480720"," two or three more."
"14481720","14485680"," A lot of you bulls are like, if we're like at a trend down day, you guys are like fucking"
"14485680","14487780"," buying that dip, buying that dip, buying that. "
"14487920","14489000"," You can buy them for a few minutes."
"14489700","14492920"," But if we're going down in a day, it's like fucking two or three legs."
"14493300","14494560"," It's not usually we're just one. "
"14494780","14496860"," Sometimes it is, but not normally."
"14504100","14511200"," I got my trade in."
"14516720","14518560"," Mr. Sheppardal, just subscribe. "
"14519080","14519460"," Thank you brother."
"14521920","14524660"," Mr. Sheppardal, I appreciate it man for subscribing on Prime."
"14524660","14526220"," Anti-shatter followed. "
"14526540","14527160"," Thank you very much."
"14527460","14528180"," Stranger danger."
"14528920","14529440"," Great name. "
"14530300","14530740"," Followed."
"14539140","14541400"," Tesla man is not fucking around, are they?"
"14543900","14545100"," Tesla's like, fuck you."
"14545300","14545780"," We're going up. "
"14547100","14549300"," Tesla's like, we'll be at 300 by fucking Friday."
"14550300","14551240"," That's what they're saying."
"14552060","14553260"," They're like, we got a ball coming next week. "
"14553400","14554500"," Let's get, let's wrap this shit up."
"14555280","14557300"," But Tesla gang's like, fuck you all."
"14558220","14560000"," Tesla just does its own thing, doesn't it?"
"14561080","14562920"," So I am not in puts right now. "
"14564080","14565120"," No puts for me."
"14565300","14570320"," Not seeing any signs that I want to see for more puts."
"14581980","14585120"," I'm a dumbass dude, so some days I haven't done it recently. "
"14586500","14589480"," I haven't done it recently, but there are times when I come to this."
"14589800","14595280"," If I'm streaming for like a straight month and we're coming into OPEX, I'll like fuck this."
"14595440","14595920"," I'm getting drunk. "
"14596160","14596960"," Like I don't normally drink."
"14596960","14599580"," It's like, it's like a month passes."
"14601100","14602560"," And I'm like, I'm worn out. "
"14602680","14603040"," I'm tired."
"14603240","14605720"," I've been like staring at the screen every day for a month."
"14606220","14607220"," I'll be like, fuck this. "
"14607500","14609420"," I'm like, I'm going to go out and drink with my buddies."
"14610880","14612900"," So I go come into stream one day."
"14613000","14614500"," I'll be tired and hung over. "
"14614640","14617300"," And I'll be like, here, you want to watch Captain Jim?"
"14617800","14619040"," Not follow his fucking system."
"14619940","14620840"," Let's do it live."
"14622280","14623440"," This stream is sponsored. "
"14623640","14625600"," You want Captain Jim not to fucking cut his losses?"
"14625600","14631840"," You want Captain Jim to fucking be up and be down and be up and be up?"
"14632140","14633140"," You can see it."
"14633260","14634920"," It's like once a month, once a quarter, it happens."
"14636340","14638240"," Once a month, once a quarter, I get tired. "
"14643960","14646220"," I don't actually drink at nighttime right now."
"14646540","14647080"," I'm just awake."
"14648340","14652600"," I'm checking like certain points in the market where I need to check in on it. "
"14653060","14654160"," So I get alerts, right?"
"14654280","14654940"," I'll get it like a ding."
"14656860","14660240"," And it's like, NQ is making an attempt to run to the downside."
"14660700","14661420"," And I'm like, shit. "
"14669510","14670910"," I got Binky called me."
"14671030","14675930"," I think it was no John Haggerty was like, middle of the night last night, I get an alert."
"14676810","14678130"," So I get on Finn to it. "
"14678230","14682850"," And I'm like, these motherfuckers are going to try to fucking run NQ down in the middle of the"
"14682850","14683050"," night."
"14683690","14685290"," Like a robbery in the middle of the night."
"14685510","14690110"," Like they're just like driving up to the truck and they're like, we're going to do a hit and run"
"14690110","14691010"," an NQ right now. "
"14691010","14693990"," And I'm like, oh, these fucking guys are in there going to sell the shit out of it."
"14694550","14697190"," So I get on Twitter and I'm like, you guys are going to do this, aren't you?"
"14699230","14700610"," And of course they do it."
"14700750","14704430"," They fucking rock it and NQ goes blasting down to the depths of hell. "
"14704430","14706430"," That like midnight or something."
"14708470","14713330"," And John Haggerty fucking sends me a tweet at like 12, 30 or something."
"14715990","14725960"," I try to watch those things because I'm like, I've had a lot of time in this market, man. "
"14726200","14730080"," Like you fucking wake up in the middle of the night and some crazy happens and we're down like"
"14730080","14731020"," fucking 300 points."
"14731240","14732800"," And you're like, what the fuck just happened?"
"14742690","14748870"," Remember earlier, Mr. Talking Monkey said 427 was the pin for today."
"14768830","14769870"," Yeah, Johnny brother. "
"14770590","14771290"," I got your two."
"14771390","14772690"," I got your text last night, my brother."
"14776810","14777570"," Yeah, John. "
"14777830","14780090"," That's what I was like middle of night last night, man."
"14780390","14781650"," And then of course I do other shit."
"14781770","14782810"," I'm like, oh shit. "
"14782970","14786050"," I'm like, I didn't make a post on trade the trigger."
"14786310","14787650"," I'm like, I gotta make a post over there."
"14789670","14791710"," And then last night I had some free times. "
"14791710","14794830"," So I watched two videos."
"14795850","14797510"," I watched part of Larry Williams."
"14798490","14802010"," I watched Mike Silva and I watched Bob Kendall last night. "
"14803170","14804330"," Like I watched those guys."
"14804470","14805370"," Those guys are good, man."
"14806150","14807470"," Those guys are real good. "
"14811220","14815620"," Well, they're good in terms of they're not looking for followers."
"14816680","14819920"," They're all three of those people tell you how it is."
"14821260","14824960"," All three of those people could have a million followers if they did clickbait shit, but they"
"14824960","14825340"," don't. "
"14828820","14830200"," Not in my view, they don't."
"14830340","14832360"," They actually tell you what's in front of you in the market."
"14832780","14834660"," I don't care if it goes their way or not. "
"14835860","14837520"," Like here that they're telling me the truth."
"14841600","14843660"," Like some of the shit that's on the internet, man."
"14843800","14844700"," I'm like, fuck me. "
"14846620","14848220"," Like this is all fucked up."
"14849300","14851220"," And you're floating around right now."
"14852240","14855480"," If you're a bull, you need to get over this right here. "
"14859240","14861420"," Floating around in space right now."
"14870210","14872310"," NDX buyers stepping in."
"14874410","14876610"," Let's see if we're a range bound for today. "
"14876830","14877010"," Okay."
"14886290","14888190"," Maybe this helped you guys out."
"14896220","14897640"," Does that help you guys?"
"14900680","14901940"," That might help you guys. "
"14902080","14902740"," Maybe this will help."
"14904500","14905460"," There you go."
"14908940","14910000"," Do your thing. "
"14910740","14921000"," Yeah, you"
"14921000","14921560"," watched Aussie."
"14921900","14922920"," I don't know."
"14923040","14924540"," I don't know who Aussie Tom is. "
"14925740","14927200"," Aussie Tom from FX."
"14928320","14929300"," I like him too."
"14931420","14934160"," I like that he's honest, that he's very bearish. "
"14934800","14936820"," So I can actually consume it."
"14936980","14939380"," I haven't watched him in a while, but what I do, I like watching him."
"14942540","14943500"," He's at least honest. "
"14944300","14947560"," I'll give him that, because he's like, he's like, I'm fucking bearish."
"14947860","14949140"," He's always bearish though."
"14949720","14952920"," But he gives you a pretty fair analysis. "
"14952920","14955800"," So I got to give him some respect for that."
"14955920","14957180"," He's not just like doom and gloom."
"14957560","14958940"," Here's another good one out there too. "
"14960720","14963040"," I haven't watched him in a while, but I did."
"14963340","14965240"," I say I've been watching him, but I fucking haven't."
"14965380","14967000"," I'm fucking lying if I say I have. "
"14967780","14969920"," I've been watching trade brigade."
"14970700","14972220"," I fucking like those guys."
"14973060","14974740"," I fucking like those guys. "
"14975480","14975960"," They get it."
"14976400","14978160"," I'm gonna warn you about trade brigade."
"14979920","14983600"," What I like about them is that they make calls in their videos. "
"14984660","14986580"," They're not always going to be right."
"14987120","14989840"," So do not be a dickhead to them."
"14990440","14993440"," I have a lot of respect for them making calls in their videos. "
"14994200","14995800"," A ton of respect for them doing that."
"14996280","14997640"," A very rare thing to do."
"14999220","15000060"," Trade brigade. "
"15000460","15001200"," Look those guys up."
"15001540","15002620"," I've never talked to them."
"15002680","15003400"," I don't know those guys. "
"15003700","15004260"," I've never commented."
"15005560","15013580"," I am fascinated by the analysis that they do, because they go through fundamentals, technicals,"
"15013580","15014480"," gamma gax."
"15014640","15016600"," I think they go through gamma gax market profile. "
"15016620","15017340"," All of it."
"15017420","15017680"," They're quick."
"15017940","15019240"," Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. "
"15021040","15026200"," Whoever the speaker is does a really good job of relaying the information."
"15026340","15027240"," He's in a good rhythm."
"15028000","15028600"," Trade brigade. "
"15029840","15031500"," I've enjoyed them a lot."
"15037940","15039200"," So FXE, Tom."
"15039420","15041380"," I'm talking about FX evolution, I think. "
"15042080","15043800"," We're talking about the same guy or no."
"15044660","15047140"," I used to watch FX evolution every once in a while too."
"15047180","15048760"," I'd stop in and watch his stuff. "
"15050500","15057320"," Yeah, I don't watch Chris Chiavacos."
"15058400","15059300"," Yeah, FXE."
"15063960","15065420"," No, that's not a good back test. "
"15068160","15068960"," That's bearish."
"15073740","15075620"," I'll show you the back test again if you're bullish."
"15078100","15078880"," Good question. "
"15080360","15081380"," It's not bullish."
"15086580","15087540"," It's a chop."
"15090500","15092680"," You need the cross right here. "
"15097320","15100240"," You need the push."
"15102020","15103120"," The failure."
"15105180","15106360"," The retest. "
"15107900","15109740"," And there's your trend right there."
"15120990","15122550"," No trade for you as a bull."
"15129880","15131180"," Good question, by the way. "
"15135880","15138040"," Even if we're even if we moon here."
"15138860","15141020"," Even if we go straight up right there."
"15141420","15142720"," I would not take that trade. "
"15144020","15145280"," That's a trap to me."
"15145900","15149560"," If you run this trade right here like 20 times, it's a trap."
"15150780","15152320"," It's a fucking trap like us. "
"15153020","15154300"," Like three or four out of 20."
"15155060","15155960"," Or 10, excuse me."
"15157420","15159900"," It's a fucking trap enough that I'll lose my shirt. "
"15160300","15161060"," I won't pay taxes."
"15161060","15162140"," My wife will leave me."
"15162180","15163120"," My dogs will leave me. "
"15163620","15164620"," Kids will leave me."
"15166400","15167080"," So no."
"15168860","15170200"," This is bearish to me. "
"15174560","15175600"," Good question though."
"15175760","15176080"," I like it."
"15176320","15176720"," Keep asking. "
"15177380","15178600"," I like answering them."
"15186250","15187730"," The colored bars on the left."
"15187970","15190810"," So this stuff here, there's two good things that I like about book map. "
"15191630","15193530"," I used to pay for a bunch of shit on book map."
"15194010","15194850"," It works."
"15196190","15199990"," For me, for me, what I really like is the order flow over here. "
"15200610","15202130"," And I like to know where the levels are."
"15204230","15208110"," I combine that with being a traditional chart."
"15208770","15212690"," I look at the, I don't do this in stream. "
"15212970","15216070"," I tried doing it in stream, but it became too much."
"15217150","15223670"," But I do have on my think or so, I built a, I have a, what do you call it?"
"15223670","15226790"," A fucking volume profile and market profile."
"15227310","15228390"," I look at that every week. "
"15230290","15233610"," And then I do traditional chart, I do traditional charting, market profile."
"15234510","15235230"," I don't do it on stream."
"15236430","15239310"," I do these levels here with book map. "
"15240070","15245770"," And, but mostly my, my, my, my trading is mostly momentum trading with price action."
"15247010","15251390"," And I want to know where a real bottom is and I want to know where a real top is."
"15252750","15254970"," I want to know the best setups to sell. "
"15255530","15257150"," I want to know the best setups to buy."
"15258170","15262210"," I don't want, and I have to trade with you guys on live stream every day."
"15262350","15266350"," Like you might not, you might not, you might, some people out there like, then why don't you just"
"15266350","15268030"," come on one, one, one, one, one, it's ready. "
"15269450","15270350"," I'm like, that's a good point."
"15271370","15273490"," But then other guys are like, I can only trade on Thursdays."
"15275370","15276410"," I want to trade today. "
"15277370","15279870"," Some guys are like, Hey, listen to you all day long in my car."
"15279870","15281490"," I drive for a living."
"15281950","15283870"," I'm in an office all day long, so I keep you on. "
"15284090","15285990"," So we're here every day."
"15287090","15289310"," We have a stock show coming out here so shortly though."
"15289430","15292970"," So if you want slowed down trading, you're going to get that on Sundays. "
"15294610","15297090"," And we're hoping to do a nightly video at some point too."
"15297290","15298670"," I just, I've been very busy right now."
"15298750","15301790"," So like falling behind again. "
"15316180","15317140"," And that's right, Lisa."
"15318040","15319900"," If you stick around this stream long enough."
"15322340","15325340"," You'll, it's some people in the stream that are like, oh, he's explaining it again. "
"15334770","15338870"," That is the strength of supply and demand."
"15339570","15340070"," Good question."
"15343530","15344170"," Hey, Winky. "
"15344310","15344730"," How you doing, brother?"
"15347150","15349710"," Yeah, I used to pay for a book map, but I don't bother anymore."
"15367990","15370950"," Dairy Doug, dairy farmer, baby."
"15371590","15372410"," Hardass work. "
"15373290","15374770"," I listen while I dairy farm."
"15374990","15375450"," Good company."
"15378890","15382370"," You guys went through some real, I was watching a dairy farming. "
"15385030","15386830"," YouTube show, not a show."
"15387090","15387730"," It was like a documentary."
"15390350","15392810"," And you guys had a rough go of it through COVID, huh?"
"15396450","15399110"," You guys are also having a rough go of it with the government too, right?"
"15406900","15411380"," Well, blog is like, dude, I'm regarded to the more times you explain it the better. "
"15411920","15420620"," Yeah, I got no trade in this."
"15420780","15423080"," I've got no, I've got no opinion on this right now."
"15424480","15427620"," I view it as bearish, but I don't have an opinion up or down. "
"15427760","15428280"," I don't like it."
"15428400","15429980"," It's not a perfect setup for me."
"15435120","15438240"," Yeah, recently too, right?"
"15438380","15439480"," Has that been the past few years?"
"15440760","15443860"," I've heard past few years have been a real struggle for dairy farmers with the government. "
"15444760","15460720"," I'm a little bit"
"15460720","15461300"," bullish here."
"15461800","15462620"," I want to buy that."
"15464000","15466180"," But I still want to see, I'll show you what I want to see. "
"15466320","15467540"," Oh, no, I'll do this."
"15467680","15468620"," I'll show you what I want to see."
"15479780","15480760"," Something like that. "
"15489280","15489860"," Put this."
"15490040","15491200"," Sometimes I do this for you guys."
"15491300","15495600"," I'll draw these out and get a feeling for what I'm looking for. "
"15532830","15535450"," Yeah, trying to check out all the market wizards books."
"15535790","15536790"," There's a bunch of them."
"15538050","15538850"," There's like, what is there?"
"15539070","15540050"," Five of those books?"
"15540390","15541430"," I didn't know there was five of them. "
"15541490","15544530"," I read the first one and I didn't know there was five."
"15544650","15546330"," I just read the first one and that's all I had."
"15546510","15548930"," And then Jenny Marcus like brothers like five of those. "
"15551490","15552890"," He's like, here's this one."
"15573490","15574170"," Yeah, Nina."
"15574490","15575930"," So, okay, Nina. "
"15576130","15578430"," So I ran into that problem the first time too."
"15578970","15580550"," First time I ever bought book map."
"15581210","15583270"," I ran the same issues you had. "
"15583510","15590070"," And I had to go down like emails and then live chats and then a phone call."
"15591110","15592910"," And then I think that there's two people."
"15593170","15594810"," I think there's two different groups of people. "
"15595830","15597870"," And they don't communicate well with each other."
"15598470","15600870"," So I was like paying for like double shit everywhere."
"15601550","15603370"," Then I was paying for shit on spot gamma. "
"15605130","15607950"," And I was like, I was like, what the fuck is going on here?"
"15608370","15610550"," And then of course they're like, well, you got to delete this one."
"15611450","15615090"," We got to cancel this subscription over here because you did this shit over on this website."
"15615130","15616690"," And then we have to do this for you here. "
"15618990","15624370"," Even after that, I had to get a like a bunch of like delete a bunch of shit."
"15624370","15626950"," And then they rebooted everything together."
"15634090","15637510"," And if you're doing that right now, you know, you should cancel everything. "
"15637710","15641310"," And then call them up and say, I want my money back."
"15642970","15645850"," Or like I want the money rolled into this new service."
"15647650","15650190"," And I have two issues here too. "
"15650510","15653190"," Like I have the, there's DX feed."
"15653410","15654390"," Then there's another feed, right?"
"15654590","15655750"," The one for cash market."
"15655750","15659670"," It was tough. "
"15660010","15667970"," Like cash market feed was good, but I got better cleaner data on the futures feed."
"15668170","15672830"," I think that's the, I think that's the DX feed is the futures feed."
"15677030","15678910"," G daddy gold, baby. "
"15679230","15679470"," What up?"

"15696390","15697690"," Did you just make a bunch of bank?"
"15701730","15702650"," No way."
"15708260","15709460"," Are you serious?"
"15711660","15713220"," You have to be kidding me. "
"15717980","15721690"," Are you serious?"
"15724470","15726030"," Oh my, holy shit."
"15728750","15730070"," What's going on man?"
"15732010","15734170"," Are you kidding me?"

"16669360","16670140"," Here's the VIX."
"16674990","16675770"," I'm like crying."
"16676369","16678330"," I'm thinking about having to go to Charlie Puth. "
"16679430","16682369"," And you would think like you'd be like, yeah, I want to go to Charlie Puth so I can hit"
"16682369","16683390"," all the moms and stuff."
"16683950","16684890"," You don't want to hit all those moms."
"16685770","16689990"," Those moms are like, they're already dealing with teenage girls and stuff. "
"16689990","16694070"," And then there's like a boy on the stage ripping his clothes off, spraying himself down with water"
"16694070","16694390"," and shit."
"16694770","16695630"," He's like, whoo."

"16714910","16716169"," We're on the one minute chart. "
"16717689","16718849"," On the VIX."
"16725700","16727500"," Little channel right here."
"16727759","16731520"," What happens if we break the red line on that channel on the VIX?"
"16732520","16736720"," Well, we're going down to C1334, baby. "
"16742230","16745270"," Do we get the squeeze?"
"16747259","16751369"," Do we return to the scene of the crime?"
"16751369","16760070"," If you were a bear earlier in this show, did you take profit?"
"16773750","16783110"," IWM with a bull cross, a bull playing on it right now, squeeze in, back to the opening price."
"16785150","16787410"," Test law going back to retest."

"17958600","17959140"," I do that one."
"17959400","17960860"," But I haven't done that one in a couple of years either. "
"17965940","17966920"," Yeah, I don't know those."

"17971880","17972360"," I don't go anymore. "
"17972560","17974460"," I haven't been going since COVID has stopped going."
"17975160","17976260"," But it's like going to Coachella."
"17978440","17979060"," No shit. "
"17984280","17985280"," Are you kidding me?"
"17986900","17988060"," So you know Sean Hearn?"
"17989500","17990820"," He's my lifelong friend."
"17992820","17995420"," I've known him since he was about six years old."
"17996180","17998220"," Maybe maybe younger six, seven, eight years old. "
"17998680","17999240"," Good friend of mine."
"18001240","18001960"," Did you really?"
"18002760","18003260"," Fuck yeah brother."
"18005300","18011260"," Yeah, I went to. "
"18011260","18013380"," I went to St. Andrews."
"18014960","18016800"," That's a bad story by the way."
"18017520","18019020"," Sean actually knows a lot about that story. "
"18019580","18021020"," So I went to the school with Sean."
"18021320","18021780"," You ready for this?"
"18022620","18023980"," This is a story time."
"18024380","18025540"," This is a story time. "
"18026120","18026840"," It's a bad story."
"18027080","18027400"," Real bad."
"18029560","18032040"," I went to school with Sean, right?"
"18034240","18037840"," There's someone in a Twitch right now saying that he knows his partner, Pat. "
"18039340","18042280"," And I went to school with Sean at a place."
"18042560","18043340"," I know it's crazy, right?"
"18043500","18044280"," They're one of you guys out there."
"18044480","18045440"," We actually have a connection here. "
"18046580","18048360"," I went to a school called St. Andrews."
"18049160","18051700"," And it's in Jamaica Plain in Boston, Massachusetts."
"18053160","18055320"," And it's private school for boys and girls, right?"
"18056420","18061940"," That school is the school that the movie Paris, no. "
"18062360","18063040"," Paris scope."
"18064160","18065280"," I think it's Paris scope."
"18066880","18067820"," It's based on. "
"18069120","18070180"," Let's see if I get the right movie."
"18074040","18075000"," Let me get that right."
"18078860","18079260"," Subbiden. "
"18079340","18079900"," No, that's not it."
"18079980","18080460"," Hold on a second."
"18080660","18081420"," Get the wrong film. "
"18081600","18082280"," Get the wrong film."
"18082600","18084240"," And the confiscation program."
"18096350","18096750"," Spotlight. "
"18098150","18100370"," I went to the school that movie is based on."
"18100370","18104890"," I went to that school while that shit was going on with Sean."
"18105130","18106010"," Sean and I were both there. "
"18106710","18113010"," Matter of fact, Sean and I have fucking friends that were fucking abused by those priests."
"18114170","18119950"," We both have very close friends we grew up with that were abused by those priests at that school."
"18124990","18126670"," They shut that shit down, man. "
"18126890","18128150"," They shut that fucking school down."
"18129830","18131010"," Some fucked up shit."
"18135470","18136710"," Yeah, small world brother. "
"18146810","18147450"," Metallica's badass."
"18150310","18151590"," Tell Sean I said hello."
"18156340","18157060"," Tell Sean. "
"18157400","18161040"," I think I think I talked to him about a decade ago, maybe five years ago."
"18161600","18162580"," I haven't talked to him in a while."
"18162820","18165800"," I haven't been around Boston in about a COVID man fucked everything up. "
"18166600","18169400"," Wasn't a five, four pre COVID."
"18170480","18175700"," So in 2019, 2021, 22, almost five years, man."
"18181330","18182130"," Yeah, it's weird. "
"18182290","18182590"," I didn't."
"18182750","18187370"," I wasn't there for the for the bombing, but all my family and friends say it was horrific."
"18189030","18190370"," I wasn't there for it. "
"18190370","18190650"," I wasn't."
"18190730","18192350"," I haven't lived there in a long, long time."
"18201240","18205180"," I wasn't there when I was, you know, when I was in Boston for nine, eleven. "
"18205920","18207140"," I was in the army then."
"18208380","18209660"," And that was fucked up."
"18210460","18213080"," I was, uh, I was holding a weapon. "
"18214980","18216580"," Within an hour loaded."
"18217600","18219400"," And then I was in New York days later."
"18225180","18226300"," And it's crazy too. "
"18226480","18230060"," Ross is talking about the few of you set the sativa guy in here talking in the chat."
"18230060","18231600"," So if you don't know, right?"
"18233400","18238220"," You're either at the marathon or you're working in downtown Boston."
"18238300","18239920"," So there's the back bay, right?"
"18240640","18243580"," And then you've got the Charles River and it's sandwiched in between it. "
"18243900","18245300"," Or all these like streets."
"18245640","18250000"," Like you've got a stirrow drive and you've got all these streets named after the alphabet, like"
"18250000","18252240"," Exeter Street, like E F G H."
"18252900","18255480"," And there's a corridor of."
"18257720","18261260"," College Ivy League school dormitories, that kind of stuff. "
"18261680","18263400"," On the other side, you've got all the hotels."
"18264100","18268800"," So you've got people that are constantly traversing the marathon up and down in Boston."
"18269020","18273000"," And when that happened, as a matter of fact, I don't know if I should say his name. "
"18273780","18276820"," Someone in this in our group of people on fintuit."
"18278140","18280060"," His wife was running the marathon."
"18281120","18284460"," His wife or his mom or something, but the whole family was there during it. "
"18285480","18286920"," Instead, it was out of control."
"18287920","18288760"," Now when it took place."
"18290580","18292140"," Yeah, Boyleson Street, baby. "
"18295040","18296460"," Boyleson Street, Commav."
"18298060","18298940"," No Boston."
"18302040","18303220"," Are we getting the power?"
"18303420","18304880"," Okay, people want to know more, right?"
"18305900","18308440"," Let's take a look at the market. "
"18311220","18312540"," I gotta get back to work, boys."
"18313300","18315500"," But it was nice, it was nice reminiscent."
"18318900","18320060"," Let's take a look at the market. "
"18324170","18325410"," What do we know here?"
"18327890","18331850"," What do we see happening when we scale out?"
"18333610","18335490"," We never caught our daily trigger."
"18338050","18338850"," Did we?"
"18340230","18346050"," We consolidated one, two, three, four, five days."
"18347050","18351710"," Cell side was not looking for a rotation. "
"18352970","18354850"," Cell side was looking for what?"
"18355950","18358170"," They were looking for distribution."
"18359430","18365310"," They did not want to see money leaving the market and heading back in somewhere else."
"18366390","18368590"," But we know that's what happened, right?"
"18369290","18371510"," We know that money did not leave the market. "
"18371690","18374910"," We know that it was sent elsewhere."
"18375330","18378470"," So I was like, whoa, a long NVDA and riches hell."
"18379210","18380850"," So all that money walked out. "
"18381770","18387390"," And it started buying other shit, Tesla, mid caps, utilities."
"18388390","18389310"," You name it, they bought it."
"18391690","18394290"," That means there's liquidity in the market. "
"18395430","18397830"," We watched yesterday's close."
"18399370","18402650"," Someone bought the stock market for billions."
"18404230","18407470"," They let a bunch of puts expire in the money. "
"18408210","18409710"," That does not happen."
"18410390","18415070"," Winky and I, when we see it, we're like, ooh, someone bought the stock market at that close."
"18416810","18419510"," Someone bought the stock market yesterday. "
"18421430","18424110"," They could have just closed that shit and they didn't."
"18425430","18428870"," When we're up here, what do we know still?"
"18429450","18435770"," We know that we buy, we sell, we buy, we sell, we buy, and we sell, right?"
"18438130","18439630"," We know some other stuff, right?"
"18439770","18440950"," We know that the money's still in the market."
"18441090","18442230"," We know they're buying the stock market. "
"18442450","18445770"," We know that one of these is going to break."
"18446290","18447110"," It's going to break."
"18447810","18452030"," The safe trade for you is to wait for the break higher. "
"18453970","18455670"," Consolidation in the move leg up."
"18455950","18457310"," That's the safe thing for you to do."
"18459230","18462070"," If they reverse this to the downside, you're fucked, right?"
"18462750","18465590"," There are sellers here that are planning on this. "
"18466230","18467290"," I assure you they are."
"18469250","18470590"," Next week, we have volatility."
"18471530","18474150"," We got one fucking day left, basically, maybe two. "
"18475050","18476190"," One, I shouldn't be swearing."
"18476510","18477910"," One, I tried to stop swearing."
"18477910","18482470"," We basically have one day left until volatility. "
"18486460","18488240"," We know where big poppy is."
"18491500","18495080"," Boy, this looks a lot stronger than that, didn't it?"
"18496120","18497120"," That looks weak."
"18497340","18497980"," That looks weak. "
"18498260","18500420"," Boy, I'll tell you what, man, that's looking."
"18502320","18503700"," That's looking like pound town."
"18503940","18504620"," Get me in there. "
"18504820","18505380"," Get me up there."
"18505580","18506140"," Get me up."
"18506860","18508060"," My call for tomorrow. "
"18508060","18508800"," We get up."
"18509840","18511240"," We trade, JPM."
"18511600","18511900"," We trade. "
"18514380","18517140"," The JPM call are Friday at some point."
"18519900","18521940"," SPX 4320 Friday."
"18524740","18525920"," That's what I think happens. "
"18531310","18532670"," I think we get up there."
"18532970","18535570"," I think we smash and bash and force our way up there."
"18536270","18540430"," I want you to know, though, that whatever we do up here, unsustainable. "
"18541370","18542930"," I'm not going to stay itself."
"18543690","18546050"," Do not believe whatever happens up here."
"18546850","18550290"," This is going to be like a roll down and of all. "
"18553970","18556810"," Now, right now, I'm on some zero dates into this bell."
"18558830","18562590"," I'm going to fucking buy zero dates like today and tomorrow for that to happen."
"18563290","18564190"," I'm going to ram it home. "
"18568970","18571410"," This is my conviction here."
"18571590","18572150"," You want my conviction?"
"18574430","18575190"," Right there."
"18578110","18579010"," That's my conviction. "
"18581030","18582270"," That's what I think happens."
"18582830","18587210"," I think this is going to be mechanical algorithm driven, garbage in tomorrow."
"18598140","18599680"," You can just see it here, right?"
"18600380","18602020"," They're making a push on it right now. "
"18602220","18602820"," They're pumping."
"18603060","18603580"," They're pushing it."
"18606240","18610220"," So for me, JPM caller gets tagged on Friday or an attempt. "
"18611180","18615620"," I'm going to be able to do it before the volatility next week."
"18619610","18620950"," That's my take on tomorrow."
"18621690","18622610"," I can be wrong here. "
"18623450","18629810"," Get some stops out below and not bearish it in tomorrow."
"18660980","18662960"," Huge for the bulls right here."
"18665040","18666720"," Huge for the bulls. "
"18668500","18669180"," Huge."
"18669180","18672480"," I can't express how big this dip I was for bulls."
"18672920","18676720"," Huge for the bulls. "
"18683740","18687440"," If this was lost right here, I don't know."
"18687600","18688860"," I'd be with bears on this one."
"18690860","18692560"," Demand stepping in. "
"18693840","18698300"," It's telling you that we've got buyers here and they ain't fucking around."
"18707460","18709740"," I don't know what it is on SPX right now."
"18709740","18710760"," I'm going to have to do the math. "
"18710940","18711920"," I haven't done the math today."
"18713300","18722840"," But for tomorrow, I'm going to price target on SPX 43.20. I'm willing to change my opinion, but it"
"18722840","18723540"," looks like it."
"18723620","18724440"," It's talking like it. "
"18724540","18725720"," It's squacking like it."
"18727160","18728660"," It ain't looking bearish."
"18729540","18731920"," I know that some of you are all going to call this a double top here. "
"18732900","18734420"," I get what you think this is."
"18734600","18736080"," This looks too bullish to me."
"18737140","18738420"," It's dangerously bullish. "
"18739740","18742860"," It's the kind of thing that if you're bearish, even if it does roll, you just get out of its"
"18742860","18743400"," fucking way."
"18744980","18745900"," Let it do its thing."
"18746060","18746660"," Let it roll first. "
"18747880","18750440"," Don't try to short this until it rolls."
"18750800","18752140"," Make sure it rolls the fuck over."
"18753020","18754580"," You can get run over in this kind of shit. "
"18756220","18757360"," I can't guarantee it."
"18758980","18764420"," But if you want to short this, just wait until it rolls and then start shorting it."
"18765600","18768200"," If this shit right here, be careful of this if you're a bear. "
"18773960","18775320"," Someone stepped in and bought."
"18777400","18778080"," Right there."
"18778180","18779080"," They bought right in there. "
"18782260","18783460"," Be careful of that."
"18783520","18783920"," I'm serious."
"18786040","18788160"," I don't know if it's just algorithms or if it's dealers. "
"18789660","18794180"," If they're delta hedging for next week's volatility, it could be a bunch of people just getting"
"18794180","18795040"," ready for next week."
"18796000","18797760"," And so dealers are on your side right now."
"18801030","18803730"," I'm going to put the herd on that trade for next week for volatility. "
"18804730","18806990"," Possible rates may stay higher for longer."
"18807290","18811490"," So Bank of Canada's Bojari says details behind April's headline inflation number were concerning"
"18811490","18815790"," three month measures of core inflation remain elevated and seem to have."
"18815830","18817910"," Do I think one day calls are a good buy here for tomorrow. "
"18817910","18819370"," Would you wait until the markets open?"
"18820450","18821830"," Surprised by accelerating."
"18822170","18824550"," So I'm in zero dates right now for this trip higher."
"18825290","18827330"," If they fail, I'm going to lose all my money. "

"18841710","18843790"," And if those fail, I'm going to buy the open tomorrow too."
"18844270","18845270"," I see us going up here."
"18845650","18848750"," In my view, do not take my advice. "
"18849570","18850390"," No advice here."
"18850710","18852630"," Read down there, not financial advice."
"18853290","18856190"," I'm telling you what my thoughts are here. "
"18857170","18858450"," There is a meaningful risk."
"18858630","18859470"," It could go up."
"18859850","18863110"," Bojari says the bank's decision to high grades on Wednesday was not taken lightly. "
"18863570","18865450"," The bank knows higher rates are not easy."
"18865630","18867210"," Do I think one days are calls good here?"
"18867470","18868210"," I don't probably not."
"18868690","18869670"," Spreads might be better. "
"18871610","18875610"," Spreads as long as they're trading above the twenty seven EMA and the five minute chart."
"18876190","18878410"," We were willing to take the short trade if you need to."
"18878410","18880190"," Information from the Pentagon now as well. "
"18880430","18884690"," So they're not aware of China and Cuba establishing the spy station and says the Wall Street"

"18891330","18894710"," Tip the balance for the Canadian June hike."
"18896350","18898590"," I just missed some big news just came out."
"18911530","18914470"," If you're really bearish here, you could get a ratio spread. "
"18915870","18917750"," For next week, a ratio spread will be nice."
"18923210","18924630"," Get a bearish ratio spread."
"18925090","18926130"," What do you call it?"
"18927050","18927930"," Put back spread. "
"18928670","18929930"," There's a bunch of different names for it."
"18942260","18944300"," Yes, PX has gotten for it right now."
"18944380","18944960"," You see it right. "
"18947600","18949180"," It's like a magnet up there."
"18950340","18952320"," It's like a magma magnet."
"18953760","18955260"," It just wants to touch it. "
"18969230","18972270"," There's the high tick right now."
"18975300","18976940"," Retesting the daily high."

"19010280","19010560"," Look at that."
"19010720","19012440"," They fucking got the high on the tick. "

"19052000","19054460"," Let's see if we can find the actual tick on."
"19057680","19058600"," What was that?"
"19059120","19059720"," October."
"19060820","19061420"," October. "
"19063260","19076420"," I was August"
"19076420","19079100"," 16th."
"19079100","19079820"," Right here."
"19081660","19082220"," Nope. "
"19085400","19087320"," Oh, I'm fucking this all up."
"19087440","19087800"," Hold on here."
"19111630","19112770"," There it is right there. "
"19122130","19123050"," There it is."
"19123050","19138910"," I believe that's"
"19138910","19139090"," it."
"19162760","19163960"," That's it right there. "
"19163960","19164900"," You guys want to see it?"
"19167540","19168900"," You want to see it on spy?"
"19180650","19181550"," R2 baby."
"19189050","19191690"," That is the GPM caller on the spy."
"19198590","19204280"," This is the top tippity top of August 15th. "
"19204280","19206340"," There's 15th or 17th somewhere in there."
"19208100","19209220"," There it is right there."
"19224810","19227090"," We normally don't flush the collar if we hit it. "
"19227290","19233730"," We normally go above it and hold it for like five days, six days for a bunch of sessions."
"19234670","19235370"," That's a good question."
"19236210","19239410"," I was trying to look at it and we normally tag it and hold it. "
"19239610","19243490"," We normally go over it and then hold it for a bit."
"19243490","19244670"," Then we repel from it."
"19245870","19247070"," It's a very good question. "
"19248030","19250130"," That doesn't mean it's going to happen this time."
"19251170","19252230"," But that's what happens."
"19252970","19254690"," That's what has happened in the past. "
"19257470","19258570"," There it is right there."
"19258710","19259310"," The orange one."
"19261230","19262510"," We'll write it in there for now. "
"19263790","19265490"," You're pretty fucking close, aren't you?"
"19271290","19273010"," It's pretty sobering to see that, right?"
"19274230","19276270"," I don't know if any of you..."
"19277890","19279210"," Two and a half months ago."
"19281590","19283550"," Two and a half months ago, I'll say this."
"19283810","19284410"," Two and a half months ago. "
"19285530","19287010"," Only a few people."
"19287510","19290970"," When that collar came out, a few of us said something."
"19292350","19296450"," A few of us earlier said, no one wants to talk about the collar. "
"19296750","19298390"," They raised the bottom of the collar."
"19300670","19302570"," So we had a low end."
"19303430","19304610"," Then the lower end became higher. "
"19305250","19306610"," The lower end stayed."
"19307230","19308690"," The last three collars, right?"
"19308990","19309890"," This one was low."
"19310230","19313970"," The last one was stayed the same. "
"19314770","19316070"," Then this one came up."
"19316250","19317470"," The bottom strike came up."
"19318250","19323450"," As soon as that happened, Fintuit just dropped the collar as a discussion. "
"19327270","19328750"," So there it is right there."
"19333980","19335900"," It's hand grenades and horseshoes."
"19336060","19336840"," It's pretty close, right?"
"19348790","19350230"," If I'm wrong on that, let me know. "
"19351730","19354530"," Let me know if I have that tick wrong."
"19355870","19358190"," 4.30.96 on Spy right now."
"19367110","19368410"," NDX rolling back over. "
"19368530","19369130"," It's retest."
"19370010","19371430"," It's 27 right now."
"19377360","19378100"," Feet picks. "
"19378760","19381860"," I don't know if any of you guys remember that stuff."
"19382320","19383100"," Some of you guys do."
"19384980","19386460"," Some of you guys follow the collar. "
"19386460","19388120"," Does the collar matter?"
"19388540","19389460"," Yeah, it matters."
"19390600","19393780"," It matters because it matters for two reasons."
"19394420","19395240"," Oh, yeah, dude. "
"19395780","19398300"," Winky just sent feet picks, baby."
"19402830","19406050"," Oh, and he did like he put his toes down."
"19406250","19407650"," So it looks like a rock ensemble. "
"19408590","19410530"," So we got feet picks from Winky."
"19414500","19415220"," Thank you for coming."
"19415440","19419860"," As Bosey says, forces that push the neutral rate slower may have the heat and could change course. "
"19420380","19422520"," There's a so back then, right?"
"19422640","19424620"," When that when that last collar is put on."
"19428910","19429750"," Do you really?"
"19447400","19448600"," I'll tell you something later."
"19448600","19452700"," I got something cool to tell you. "
"19452700","19458420"," I ain't looking to be sober cap sobering to be the be in this feed since three to five watching"
"19458420","19459720"," it work up to here."
"19459800","19460620"," Yeah, it's kind of weird, right?"
"19460780","19461220"," Just some guy."
"19463040","19464480"," It's kind of weird to be here, right?"
"19465660","19466800"," It's definitely weird. "
"19470460","19475860"," Even this close like just being this close to it is like, wow, can't believe we're here right now."
"19477520","19479800"," It's kind of like being at the top of Everest right now."
"19491920","19493860"," Just waiting on NASDAQ, baby. "
"19494000","19494940"," Come on NASDAQ."
"19500850","19502750"," Well, it's like the JPM color."
"19502990","19504930"," What's what's what's interesting about?"
"19505110","19507170"," Well, I won't go through the field right now, but. "
"19509430","19516250"," It it it does a lot for the market and a lot of people follow it, not just us, but"
"19516250","19518170"," other funds do."
"19520170","19523490"," And there's an intense behind it that helps you as an investor."
"19525710","19532410"," Believe it or not, I said someone in my Twitter yesterday say something like the market should be. "
"19534050","19535930"," Something about like a discovery."
"19536550","19540070"," They wanted a real discovery in the market and I'm like, no, you don't."
"19540570","19542670"," I don't care if you're a bull or a bear. "
"19542810","19545510"," You don't want a real discovery in our market."
"19546150","19548750"," I think that they think that it would go to the depths of hell."
"19549610","19553410"," And even if it did, they wouldn't be able to afford to trade it. "
"19554490","19556870"," They'd be blown the fuck out as before they even knew it."
"19558030","19559110"," They'd get torched."
"19563190","19564750"," Probably to the upside too. "
"19565870","19566950"," They get torched."
"19568310","19570290"," And then you have like two people trading one ticker."
"19571110","19577830"," Not the fundamentals, but we should try that on a computer simulation and see what actually"
"19577830","19578250"," happens. "
"19578450","19581310"," I guess if you wanted that to happen, you should go live in Nigeria or something."
"19582230","19583730"," You can have fun with that economy."
"19592000","19593180"," Is it a lucrative trade?"
"19593520","19595060"," No, it's it's a really cool trade. "
"19595200","19601480"," There's better trades than that, but in these days, there's smarter trades in that trade, but it"
"19601480","19602520"," works well for JPM."
"19602520","19604480"," I'll go over it."
"19604540","19607020"," If we have time tomorrow, I'll go over it in depth with you. "
"19608240","19609300"," It's a long conversation."
"19611760","19616580"," But I have a pretty good spiel on it for people to grasp it simply."
"19617780","19619380"," So if you want a simple explanation. "
"19620280","19621400"," So you're not like I."
"19621640","19626080"," When I tried to figure it out, I was like, I don't understand all this shit."
"19626800","19630320"," They're like read, read, read, read, read, read, read, read, read, read, read, read."
"19630780","19632180"," Then I was like, I get it now. "
"19632380","19634300"," Why didn't you just fucking simplify it for people?"
"19638080","19639920"," But they don't, everything's a mystery, right?"
"19642140","19644560"," So I'll give you the, I'll give you the simplified version tomorrow."
"19644920","19646860"," It's pretty easy to understand once you get it."
"19647880","19653400"," And then later on at 6.45 p.m. Eastern time or holding a news conference. "
"19656480","19658740"," So someone asked if I could go over Tesla here."
"19658740","19661360"," Tesla's cranking right now."
"19662040","19665120"," It is now broken out above that next channel. "
"19666920","19669480"," Target 250 by Friday if it can do it."
"19670740","19671780"," Maybe 300."
"19672200","19672540"," I don't know. "
"19672760","19673820"," These fucking guys are crazy."
"19676680","19679440"," I'd be paying attention to the spoos."
"19679980","19681160"," That's what I'd be watching. "
"19682560","19686440"," If the spoos tops out, take the money and run on Tesla."
"19686440","19689480"," 4.45 p.m. Eastern time."
"19689840","19692160"," So now currently holding an economic progress report. "
"19692340","19693620"," And then later on holding India."
"19693740","19694220"," I mean tomorrow."
"19694640","19696120"," 4.45 p.m. Eastern time. "
"19697860","19699440"," Is it guaranteed to happen?"
"19699660","19706300"," No, but you're going to see spy roll over here in the next few sessions."
"19706660","19709780"," Whenever that roll over takes place, Tesla's going to roll with it."
"19710220","19710800"," It'll consolidate. "
"19713880","19716480"," It'll consolidate as the market deals with."
"19716660","19717540"," So we have like market."
"19719320","19721120"," Things that have to be worked on. "
"19721240","19723700"," I know that you think or you want Tesla to go to the moon tomorrow."
"19723700","19724540"," I do too."
"19725240","19729060"," But whenever we have market stuff, everything goes on pause, right?"
"19729260","19729860"," We pause everything. "
"19730860","19732120"," Can't go into a meeting."
"19733460","19734540"," Tesla's tech, right?"
"19734980","19737560"," You want to go to a meeting and listen to what the big man says."
"19739980","19741480"," Mr. Powell has to say. "
"19742280","19744820"," So you're going to see Tesla holders."
"19745920","19747420"," Be cautious, right?"
"19747800","19748920"," You might not be cautious."
"19750060","19752740"," But a Tesla holder is they're going to put a hedge in the market. "
"19753260","19755000"," They might remove their money from Tesla."
"19755960","19758880"," They'll reenter the trade after Jerome speaks."
"19760840","19763300"," You have to have respect for these guys and what they're doing. "
"19769790","19771030"," Even if you don't like them."
"19771030","19772910"," It's their markets, what they do."
"19781490","19784070"," Yeah, by Friday, you should see by tomorrow. "
"19785630","19787990"," By Friday, tomorrow you should see."
"19789170","19791950"," You should see the market begin to pull back."
"19794330","19796730"," You should see people hedging for next week. "
"19796930","19800590"," You should see people divesting themselves to the market."
"19801410","19803450"," Hedging their positions if they're going to stay long."
"19804830","19805950"," Into next week. "
"19805950","19807410"," Expect volatility next week."
"19807470","19807950"," I'm warning you."
"19808150","19808910"," You hurt. "

"19812550","19817170"," Do not come in next week on Monday and be like, well, what the fuck's going on?"
"19818950","19820670"," Because there are people planning for it."

"19824530","19828050"," If you don't have a plan for next week, taste Thursday, right?"
"19828730","19830230"," If you don't have a plan for next week."

"20074030","20074430"," a rate hike?"
"20074650","20075570"," Do we not get a rate hike?"
"20078130","20082650"," And a bunch of stuff coming out, a bunch of data that they already know about."
"20085930","20087150"," That volatility is. "

"20226690","20226930"," So."
"20230960","20233960"," Like whatever we're up in there, like we're like way down or way up."
"20234120","20238420"," The algorithms are just like slam, get out and slam all these, all these stops out. "
"20239080","20240880"," And you're like, wait a minute, now that I'm a chart."
"20241260","20243180"," You're like, why don't we get down there and do that?"
"20244440","20246800"," It's these fucking algorithms like hunt and seek."
"20249940","20252840"," So sometimes I'll throw shit out the window when we get around these. "
"20253120","20254680"," Right around here, I'll throw shit out the window."
"20261210","20261950"," Yeah, man."

"20291650","20292910"," And I need to touch that right there. "
"20292930","20293850"," I don't care how we touch it."
"20294370","20294990"," I'm like, all right."
"20295270","20295870"," Easy, how easy. "
"20297690","20298610"," Easy, how."

"20320790","20323750"," So at any point, man, we can have some weird shit happen."
"20324670","20326770"," So can we get a market glitch here today and tomorrow?"
"20327030","20327630"," Fuck yeah, we can."
"20327910","20328930"," Fucking right, we can. "
"20334870","20335750"," Yeah, exactly."
"20336490","20338590"," Yeah, the health and how 2000 did one."
"20340870","20342450"," He talks about them all the time. "
"20342830","20345410"," So so Jedi Marcus used to be a pit trader."
"20345530","20346290"," You guys know that?"
"20347210","20348270"," He's an old school pit trader."
"20348530","20350010"," He was a pit trader in the 87 crash. "
"20353150","20355010"," So he knows about this stuff."
"20355370","20358450"," Like the algorithms, man, they don't care."
"20358810","20359930"," Like they don't fucking care. "
"20361050","20364730"," He just threw everything out the window for a few moments while it does its thing."
"20370800","20373680"," Do we think we can see some light moves here at least into overnight?"
"20374000","20374360"," Yeah, I do."
"20375260","20375840"," I do. "
"20377220","20379740"," For me, my issue here is."
"20382120","20384100"," I think that's bothering me here."

"21005590","21010730"," Do you think we make a run for the caller by the close tomorrow?"
"21012390","21014570"," Do you think that we're pinned tomorrow?"
"21014970","21016910"," Do you think we roll down tomorrow?"
"21017530","21018170"," Be honest. "
"21018410","21020110"," Don't give me your emotional answer."
"21021330","21022690"," Help out your fellow trainer."
"21022890","21023250"," Be honest. "
"21023250","21026390"," Do you think we're going up tomorrow?"
"21027650","21030150"," Sideways tomorrow or depths of hell?"
"21042790","21043470"," Pintill CPI."
"21043930","21045270"," Thanks, Dan Lee, for checking in, brother."
"21051150","21052870"," Do you think they run it right now?"
"21055050","21056690"," I think we're going up tomorrow. "
"21057090","21057750"," Depth next week."
"21058010","21058710"," Run for the caller."
"21062210","21066470"," Yeah, I think I think if you're a fucking bear, man, you guys are going to shine next week. "
"21067690","21069650"," You guys are going to fucking make some money."
"21070850","21072470"," I think you got it coming."
"21073590","21076330"," I'm on like team bear next week for sure. "
"21076630","21079790"," My question is, do they start it like today?"
"21080270","21082450"," Do they start it tomorrow, like two in the afternoon?"
"21083250","21085490"," Do they do it a Monday?"
"21087090","21089190"," It's always like a guess when they're going to do it."
"21092350","21093350"," That's my big question."
"21093850","21094690"," When does it start?"
"21096270","21100010"," It's usually like 10, 30 in the morning or 2, 30 in the afternoon. "
"21100210","21102570"," It's like, it's like, whoa, yeah."
"21103090","21107010"," Then they're like, there's rug pull you for the event next week."
"21112170","21114510"," 4, 29, 34. "
"21119420","21121740"," 4, 29, 36."
"21122520","21123380"," Jesus Christ."
"21125420","21128320"," Is anybody paying attention to SPX right now?"
"21141140","21142420"," Spy, baby. "
"21143280","21149060"," Trying to get up there and trade the return to the scene of the crime."
"21150100","21153440"," We have the JPM caller, like a carrot."
"21154620","21156220"," Dangled above your head. "
"21159020","21161960"," Squeezing now, 4, 29, 42."
"21168780","21170420"," Less 15 minutes."
"21170780","21173740"," Do they gap us up into tomorrow is the question. "
"21174720","21176880"," Do we wake up with the gap?"
"21177200","21180100"," Does it roll and then slam higher tomorrow?"
"21187470","21188890"," Disgusting into this close."
"21189230","21189790"," Look at it."
"21194950","21197550"," Oh, there it goes, baby. "
"21202400","21204700"," Savage is only 10 minutes left."
"21205040","21208440"," We've got one that billion to the buy size to wait for the final orders to come through before we"
"21208440","21208740"," call it."
"21210300","21211660"," Buy side, baby. "
"21212900","21213880"," Mark some closing balance."
"21214200","21215620"," Two spot one billion to the buy side."
"21215620","21216500"," So that's the market on closing. "
"21216500","21219460"," A whole bunch of buy orders coming in in this close."
"21241050","21242370"," 4, 29."
"21242650","21243530"," Look at this fucking thing. "
"21325820","21327740"," Al goes, baby."
"21327740","21351380"," All right, let's"
"21351380","21352600"," put some calls on for tomorrow."
"21352640","21355740"," I closed them calls out June 9th. "
"21356640","21359520"," 4, 32 just went to fucking 21 cents."
"21360380","21361440"," Yeah, no shit."
"21362220","21362820"," No shit. "
"21362980","21364300"," They just went to 22 cents."
"21367140","21369380"," Like 430 fucking two right here, man."
"21369480","21371220"," The 21 cents, you're shitting me. "
"21371920","21373860"," You got to be shitting me 21 cents."
"21380960","21382420"," I'm missing something here."
"21382420","21383340"," What am I missing here?"
"21384360","21385360"," I know I'm missing something. "
"21385540","21386580"," I don't know what I'm missing here."
"21388060","21389260"," Gap up or something."
"21390420","21392000"," I have no fucking I'm missing something. "
"21392160","21392980"," I don't know what it is."
"21394560","21396860"," I know that I'm missing something in tomorrow."
"21404500","21406300"," I don't know quite what it is. "
"21407080","21408220"," I'm missing something."
"21410840","21415420"," I don't know if the gap up happens in the overnight, or if the gap up happens on the open"
"21415420","21415900"," tomorrow."
"21416440","21417920"," I can't tell. "
"21422070","21428110"," You know who I do trust is I trust ST, a short seller ST, and he's saying it's 4.36."
"21428730","21429650"," I agree with him, man."
"21432630","21438230"," No, no, no."
"21438790","21442030"," This has to do with last month's end of month trades. "
"21442190","21445310"," Like some of this stuff you guys know has to do with last month, right?"
"21445530","21446410"," They didn't hit it last month."
"21446750","21448290"," We got past OPEX in a month."
"21448650","21449650"," Then they tag it. "
"21451870","21454730"," Then they roll us over and get into I don't know if we go up."
"21455010","21459170"," I can't guarantee we're going to gap up tomorrow, but dude, I'm telling me in the background smells"
"21459170","21459730"," like it."
"21460110","21468190"," It fucking smells like it. "
"21468790","21470310"," I trust this guy, man."
"21471110","21472450"," I trust this guy a fucking ton."
"21472830","21478650"," So it's a short seller ST set up 4.36 for tomorrow. "
"21479930","21481470"," And I see that same shit."
"21481650","21483810"," Like I see like a fucking moon mission tomorrow."
"21484230","21487530"," So I don't be careful out there if you're trying to short this shit. "
"21493560","21495900"," And for me, for tomorrow, just heads up."
"21496120","21497680"," So into this bell right here, right?"
"21497680","21500920"," We've got five minutes left into this bell, right?"
"21501900","21505820"," I'm going to get some 432 C's here in this bell."
"21506300","21511840"," They could burn, but it'd be worth the trade for 60 cents. "
"21512440","21516300"," So I'm going to take this trade on this bell down here."
"21516940","21517980"," You put on the one minute chart."
"21521790","21524550"," I still think we can roll down. "
"21525350","21526430"," I'll just leave this here."
"21529250","21531690"," I still think we can like roll this down somehow."
"21540180","21542160"," In the overnight, like drift lower. "
"21548180","21549820"," Some kind of like weirdness here."
"21550000","21550600"," Hold on a second here."
"21552300","21553200"," We got a couple minutes. "
"21553220","21554040"," We can talk about this."
"21554880","21557120"," There's some kind of like weirdness here, not weirdness."
"21558040","21560200"," So on an hourly time frame, right?"
"21562520","21563880"," On an hourly time frame. "
"21569180","21579510"," There's like some kind"
"21579510","21580410"," of action like this."
"21581390","21583530"," We come into that like six o'clock hour or something."
"21583710","21585030"," It's just going to start fucking running. "
"21585770","21587970"," So I don't know if your call's going to be fucked in here."
"21588070","21589130"," The dealer's going to fuck you."
"21589170","21590350"," It's just better to buy him here. "
"21591510","21592810"," But there is in here."
"21595890","21598950"," I'm assuring you that there's a leg tomorrow."
"21625540","21626540"," It's right there. "
"21630160","21633520"," You are going to look for the caller to be tagged tomorrow."
"21634040","21634940"," I assure you that."
"21636220","21637660"," It'll be roughly right there. "
"21639760","21640920"," I am long calls."
"21641120","21642220"," I bought calls for tomorrow."
"21643280","21645920"," I am on 432 C's. "
"21646480","21648120"," I'll build a position in this bell."
"21649400","21650500"," This R3 right here."
"21650500","21654640"," There's another R3 will move up tomorrow, I believe, to 432. "
"21656000","21657980"," And there's some other targets higher."
"21659460","21662680"," I'll have a better understanding tomorrow of where they are."
"21664000","21667360"," But be real, real careful. "
"21667720","21670220"," If you're a short side, you have no trade in here."
"21671320","21671540"," None."
"21672900","21677320"," If we break below and start selling down, this is where your trade is. "
"21678180","21682760"," If you're going to be short, the market, you want to be short below 428."
"21686760","21690100"," Anything else you can get trapped in, 428, somewhere down in here."
"21691620","21695320"," If you want to be short, this market in tomorrow, down, down, down here somewhere. "
"21696460","21698160"," Be weary if you're a seller."
"21703790","21708210"," You want to see a failure, get under here, something like that."
"21708210","21710010"," You can trade that, I guess. "
"21710450","21716590"," But my fear here is that you'll be shorting this and it's going to rip on you."
"21716850","21717910"," You can get in trouble with this trade."
"21718790","21719890"," You'll get a fucking margin call. "
"21720070","21720690"," I guarantee it."
"21722010","21723110"," Just be cool, man."
"21723590","21724450"," If you're a seller, be cool. "
"21725490","21727090"," Next week, you're the boss."
"21727490","21728810"," I'll listen to you all next week."
"21729090","21732390"," Tell me, tomorrow, at some point, whatever that is, just in here. "
"21732550","21733170"," Be very careful."
"21734770","21735850"," Make a friend or friend."
"21736510","21736850"," Be careful. "
"21749640","21751080"," Yeah, be super careful in here."
"21751360","21753760"," On an hourly chart, it's right here."
"21755460","21759820"," You can pretty much see it on an hourly chart. "
"21764090","21765350"," You can take the short."
"21767770","21768450"," It's right here."
"21768550","21771810"," You can actually see I'll give it to you in a better scope here. "
"21781630","21783190"," It's like right fucking there."
"21788920","21790380"," It's right fucking there."
"21792220","21795220"," Now, if you want to be short this, I get that too. "
"21795460","21798460"," According to ICI, total money market fund assets."
"21798860","21800560"," You see that yellow line I've got right there?"
"21801880","21803800"," You want to see weakness in the overnight."
"21803800","21806960"," In the week ended June 7th. "
"21808500","21812740"," You want to get underneath and reject 428."
"21813560","21814720"," That's what I think I talked about earlier."
"21815380","21821960"," I just made them 42050 and have some real blood here. "
"21822320","21823680"," That's where you get short right there."
"21825240","21827340"," Right on that green bar I showed you earlier."
"21827740","21829420"," You have to get underneath this. "
"21834640","21836340"," Here's your target right here."
"21838100","21840240"," That's a good trade right there for short."
"21841400","21842460"," It's a really good trade. "
"21846120","21847620"," Maybe this is the bull trap."
"21850060","21851000"," That's your bull trap."
"21851120","21853600"," You want to snap picture of that for yourself so you can see it?"
"21857600","21861760"," See, this MP rises 20% from October low to enter bull market. "
"21862520","21864120"," Yeah, we're in the bull market again."
"21864380","21866100"," Be super fucking careful in here."
"21867520","21868860"," Super fucking careful. "
"21878660","21879980"," There it is right there."
"21880140","21882000"," I mean, traditional chart and I'd still do it."
"21882100","21883240"," I learned how to traditional chart. "
"21883860","21885100"," It's right fucking there."
"21887060","21889400"," That shit just goes boom."
"21891820","21893240"," Thank you for playing, mom. "
"21894100","21894700"," Fucking."
"21897100","21898580"," You're like, oh shit."
"21899060","21900040"," Oh shit. "
"21907750","21908350"," Okay."
"21909270","21910810"," Thanks for showing up today."
"21912350","21913990"," I am very grateful. "

"21923870","21925890"," We have one more show for the week."
"21927730","21928990"," I'm going to be tired."
"21929250","21929750"," Do you know it's crazy?"
"21930410","21933870"," I'm going to be tired, man, before we ever get to OPEX. "
"21934830","21936890"," We get this craziness here."
"21938190","21944510"," And then we've got craziness next week with the Fed."
"21946070","21948050"," Then we have OPEX craziness. "

"21977730","21978590"," I can't believe that."
"21983950","21985750"," I really appreciate it, brothers and sisters. "
"21986050","21987330"," I love you guys."
"21992180","21994540"," So the Chancellor Hunt is expected to confirm."

"21997100","21998880"," 35% levy in the company."
"21998920","21999560"," Thank you, community."
"22000360","22002760"," That only applies if oil answered. "
"22002980","22003780"," You guys tomorrow, guys."
"22004100","22007000"," I can't believe we're realizing this."
"22007000","22012320"," I can't believe we're realizing this for retail traders. "
"22012980","22014380"," It's pretty fucking awesome."
"22015040","22016840"," I'll see you guys tomorrow. "
