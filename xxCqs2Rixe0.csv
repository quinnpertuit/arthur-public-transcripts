"128860","129520"," We're just a minute here."
"129680","131800"," We are selling right now this morning right off the bell."

"230850","232090"," Give me just a second here. "
"252200","253460"," How's everybody doing this morning?"
"253660","255180"," Some of you made a lot of money yesterday."
"255399","256459"," I know that for sure."
"257779","259220"," Myself not so good. "
"259500","261380"," This is probably going to be my one."
"262020","264600"," Losing first losing we could have had some time."
"265300","266200"," So not a half. "
"266340","267520"," Definitely not happy today."
"267980","270220"," It actually bought the clothes yesterday."
"270220","276560"," And I have Netflix calls for today and I have spy calls that I bought. "
"277480","279640"," Maybe a minute at the close yesterday."
"280180","283680"," I don't think I said that in stream yesterday, but I'm not doing well on those right now."
"284060","288180"," As a matter of fact, I can't log into a couple brokerages right now. "
"288180","289560"," I'm going to find out what's going on."
"294300","296860"," But I think it's I think it's just something on my end."
"306740","309000"," We have a lot to talk about this morning. "
"309860","311200"," We're going to talk about."
"312340","313420"," Upload thumbnail."
"314260","314880"," Please let me do that. "
"315080","319420"," Just noting as well as the banking sector continues to suffer on this SVP."
"319760","320020"," Yeah."
"320600","324420"," Deutsche Bank and Avonza Bank shares and credit suites will extend losses. "
"324880","327600"," I want to warn you eight and nine spots, six percent collectively."
"327600","332820"," I was saying this yesterday, it closed yesterday for the top of the hour where we are expecting"
"332820","334540"," comments from the president of God."
"336980","340380"," There's kind of a so I'm a little bit older here. "
"341100","343840"," I'm not going to tell you my age, but I'm a little bit older."
"345260","349620"," And yes, the last half hour of the stream yesterday or so."
"352570","354490"," And then after the stream yesterday. "
"357750","360870"," I was talking in stream yesterday, heading into the close yesterday."
"366430","368490"," And about about the market, right?"
"368830","371430"," And one of the fascinating things about the market yesterday was that."
"371770","375610"," We'll just start talking about this right now for a brief moment. "
"375610","386190"," So back in 0708, you"
"386190","388130"," had banks trying to shop."
"388410","390030"," I think it was Lehman Brothers that was doing this off."
"390190","392030"," This is just by recollection here at this point. "
"392150","392250"," So."
"393810","394130"," Allegedly."
"396510","401010"," What I remember from it was there was shopping around for financing. "
"402490","407130"," To start saving that bank and maybe even some other banks can't remember."
"407590","408550"," And it was pretty public."
"408770","409390"," It was on CNBC. "
"410570","413050"," You saw it in the news and then within a few days."
"414110","416130"," Maybe it was three weeks or three days."
"416390","417570"," I recall it being pretty quickly. "
"418830","422670"," It started to poison and infect the entire market."
"425430","430950"," And, you know, it's like it's different than rates or inflation or anything like that."
"431070","434630"," When you if there's poison within the banking system. "
"434690","436210"," There's a few things I remember."
"436490","437550"," I remember specifically."
"439950","444830"," I remember specifically that there was even a I tried looking it up this morning. "
"444830","445670"," I couldn't find it."
"446050","448670"," There was some panic even in the United States."
"450110","451370"," Where people were talking. "
"451610","453310"," Hey, should I get my money out of the bank?"
"453330","454870"," Will this grow into something larger?"
"456030","457450"," I remember the conversation."
"457850","459370"," I think it was in the rotunda or the footsteps."
"461030","465770"," Inside one of the capital buildings where the president was kind of coerced into saying. "
"466450","468630"," We'll get this done, you know, before the weekend is out."
"468710","470210"," Make sure people get paychecks."
"471150","474610"," And I also remember people never again trusting banks again. "
"474610","480130"," In that time period, they used to be high flyers."
"480310","482690"," Banks were like high flyers up into that point."
"484130","486370"," And they never have been since then. "
"487950","489370"," And fascinatingly enough yesterday."
"490550","497890"," I got a call by YMB yesterday and he said, Hey, if you checked out the new Robin Hood charting,"
"497930","499010"," I was like, no, I have no idea."
"499090","500150"," So we logged in together. "
"502450","508510"," Yesterday and we read what the news recap was for retail traders on."
"510490","511270"," Robin Hood."
"512250","514309"," And the entire focus. "
"516150","520490"," Of yesterday on on the Robin Hood news for retail trade."
"520789","522309"," You can figure this is the new trader in the market."
"522730","526610"," It was not only two things had nothing to do with crypto and employees in the banks. "
"526890","527950"," None of that stuff."
"528170","529450"," It was focused on two things."
"529450","532410"," I think it was a rate increases. "
"534430","536890"," And an unemployment report."
"537150","537510"," That was it."
"540550","542290"," And we found that fascinating. "
"543830","547230"," And then we went on to Webull news, three, what they had to say."
"547450","549290"," And they didn't mention banking at all."
"549970","550890"," They didn't mention crypto. "
"551270","551890"," They didn't mention banking."
"552870","555790"," And that story was pitched on new squawks yesterday."
"558390","560910"," Not inflation, not 50 BPS. "
"561890","563750"," Is there poison in the banks?"
"566250","572170"," So I assure you, number one, that regardless of what the news is being pushed to you."
"573030","579130"," Then in the background, there is definitely, definitely fear somewhere."
"580910","582650"," Whether that's behind the scenes. "
"583570","588550"," Whether you're being told that or if that's that that story is pushed and then not pushing any"
"588550","588770"," longer."
"588770","590450"," I assure you that behind the scenes there is."
"591190","592870"," It was probably great fear. "
"593890","598270"," That story was kind of downgraded yesterday as the night we're on yesterday as well."
"598910","602870"," That's because they don't want no one wants to start a panic in the system either."
"603310","605950"," It's one thing to be dealing with an inverted yield curve. "
"607530","608130"," Dealing with."
"609670","613450"," I don't know, fed rate hikes or I don't know, you car costs too much."
"614130","617130"," But if you panic, the citizens or the society. "
"618330","620890"," Just keep in mind in five minutes time now, the top of the hour."
"621090","625190"," He's the best president of God to be visiting the German Chancellor's Schultz."
"625870","630190"," Make sure on a media coverage of this or not, but the God again, he'd be meeting Germany's"
"630190","631650"," Chancellor's Schultz to the top of the hour. "
"633950","635330"," Sweet, we are on live here."
"635610","635970"," Okay, good."
"636570","638250"," So I want you to know that. "
"639450","642130"," They're not going to tell you and they're not going to."
"642170","643550"," I'm not saying what's good."
"643730","644670"," This is actually going on. "
"645210","648950"," But if there is real inquisition behind the scenes, they're not going to come out in the news and"
"648950","650250"," tell you to panic or anything like that."
"650450","656190"," And there are probably many people alive right now that were old enough then to remember."
"656190","663950"," It's funny too, because there were news stories as Lehman was, was collapsing of small communities"
"663950","664890"," in the United States. "
"665110","668970"," I don't remember which newscaster was, but was saying, you know, there's no worries in the US."
"669110","670110"," We've got FDIC insurance."
"670570","671310"," You don't even have to worry. "
"672150","677110"," And I think there was even some freezing of removing assets from banks in the US at that time"
"677110","677350"," period."
"677490","678290"," But I couldn't find it today."
"678350","679150"," I remember it happening. "
"680010","683770"," I don't even remember my family having this conversation when I was younger."
"685510","689730"," And it's one of those things that no one trusts."
"689930","693550"," If you're older, you know not to trust banks ever. "
"695970","700070"," I think even if you meet a trainer and investor from that time period that's old, I'll tell you,"
"700310","702970"," they'll never trust the bank ever anything that they say."
"704670","709770"," So if that is there still right right now today, we may not even know it and they wouldn't tell"
"709770","710930"," you until it was too late."
"711710","717450"," And what they will do is collapse in on themselves before they take the hit. "
"717670","724730"," There were there pictures and videos of Drake and champagne and saying, fuck you to protesters."
"725990","734010"," I went to Burning Man that year when they were occupied Wall Street and people got fucked."
"734510","735470"," And that that really happened. "
"735710","736950"," People got fucked at that time."
"737430","739250"," So if they can fuck you now, they will."
"739530","740750"," I just said F like four times. "
"740930","742590"," It shouldn't have said that that's my F's for the day."
"744230","745450"," But that's what happened."
"746030","749170"," And so if they do that again, that's a whole nother. "
"749310","750550"," That's a whole nother thing."
"751450","753330"," How wrapped up are they in crypto?"
"753670","755910"," How wrapped up are they in Bitcoin processing?"
"757990","758830"," You name it."
"758970","761250"," You don't we really don't know and they're not going to tell you. "
"766380","772920"," This is just noting a variety of smaller banking shares being halted for volatility here."
"773020","778500"," That's Western Alliance so far to get WAL and the first Republic as well to get FRC falling around"
"778500","781000"," 30 and 51% respectively."
"781580","783200"," A little warning of some other things. "
"784020","784640"," XLF."
"785720","788580"," Is still considered one of the main drivers."
"791280","797500"," Stable drivers of the S&P 500 the health of the S&P 500. "
"798420","800260"," If you in your own life."
"802200","803720"," You need to eat eggs."
"803940","805340"," We talk about eggs all the time here, right?"
"805760","806760"," You can eat your eggs in the morning. "
"807060","808140"," You eat your steak at nighttime."
"809380","816000"," You've got producers that produce those those goods for you banks finance these farms and ranches."
"816860","819800"," And they're one of the main things that you need in life, right?"
"819900","823420"," You need people to produce goods for you to live and survive and all that stuff. "
"825100","828480"," You need your car and stuff, but you need your medicine."
"828760","829680"," You need your food."
"829960","830660"," You need a housing. "
"831320","835720"," You need gas or electricity utilities are a big driver, right?"
"835880","839460"," The health of people or investors hide in utilities."
"840320","841980"," There's some safety there, right?"
"842820","843880"," People need those things."
"844440","847820"," And one of the key drivers in the background is the banking system. "
"850700","855260"," So when you see XLF liquidate yesterday, it's telling you something."
"855420","860000"," It's telling you that smart people are raining in cash."
"861420","862720"," In case it's poison. "
"863680","865160"," They don't know how bad it is."
"865160","866860"," Or maybe they know and are not telling you."
"867140","869060"," They're not going to come out and tell you this. "
"870320","873780"," So you saw XLF liquidate yesterday, basically."
"874480","876720"," And they knew exactly which banks to liquidate yesterday."
"877560","883080"," If you go through the component or with the sub components of that sector, they knew exactly who to"
"883080","883460"," go after. "
"884740","887100"," And in the middle of the day and the end of the day."
"887800","888960"," Now that should trigger."
"889960","896940"," Some kind of a liquidation event around other sectors at some point, whether that's today, Monday,"
"897500","898740"," and they don't care will happen. "
"899540","903360"," You will likely, and then the liquidation event doesn't mean like crash or anything like that."
"903480","905120"," But you will see it in the next couple of days."
"905340","910500"," No matter where we trade today, no matter how high we trade, you're going to see it. "
"910680","911560"," You'll likely see it."
"911680","914940"," I haven't looked at XLF in a little bit, but I'm looking for it around."
"915340","917240"," I think it's 34 or 34 in XLF. "
"917280","918420"," We'll take a look at it this morning."
"919680","925120"," But if it even gets up there, you'll likely see it at some point."
"928210","929250"," Some were up in here. "
"929250","940900"," And one of"
"940900","950900"," the poisonous things of these events when this happens is that it's one"
"950900","955000"," of the rare things that you cannot stifle once it starts."
"956100","962300"," Well, if that panic starts at any point and begins, it won't be stifled until there's a shakeout."
"967410","971770"," There's nothing that the Fed ever can do about it unless they step in to save banks. "
"983600","984540"," It's really weird."
"984640","986560"," I'm like, why is my hang tight here?"
"998000","999760"," I had to install some updates or something."
"1000600","1001160"," Thanks. "
"1085550","1086570"," It's pretty odd."
"1086650","1088110"," I'm having some weirdness going on this morning."
"1101970","1106390"," So some news in this morning, we have US short-term interest rate futures jump after the jobs"
"1106390","1111310"," report is traders price in shallower Fed rate hike path. "
"1113150","1119090"," Fed swaps downgrade odds of 50 BP March rate hike to under 50%."
"1119090","1121890"," That was the topic of conversation yesterday."
"1122390","1128630"," Will there be a Fed rate hike to 50 BPS?"
"1128870","1134890"," Will there be a surprise hike to 60 BPS, 75 BPS, 100 BPS?"
"1136010","1137870"," Will there be a shock to the market?"
"1138010","1139830"," And of course, now this morning, that's not the news. "
"1140990","1145370"," Yesterday, the news was crypto and banking Silvergate."
"1146710","1152710"," Last week, we looked at Silvergate and said, is there any kind of poison in the market so we don't"
"1152710","1153190"," know about?"
"1153970","1158610"," And remember, the news that was pushed was, no, no, no, everything is fine."
"1159930","1161890"," And then, of course, yesterday, it wasn't fine, right?"
"1164910","1169150"," And then I heard rumors that it was Biden, what he's proposing, which I think is insane. "
"1171010","1175090"," 21 to 28% corporate tax rates, like get out of here."
"1177170","1179950"," He thinks we're living in the 1930s or something."
"1180450","1182410"," We don't live in those times anymore, I apologize. "
"1186280","1189280"," Still trading under the one minute, we're in the five minute chart right now."
"1226850","1230570"," SVB financial trading halted for news pending this morning."
"1231290","1236510"," If you're young and this sounds so familiar to me, I remember this. "
"1238390","1243030"," We've heard this before, the Fed are now seen as more likely to deliver a 25 BPS rate hike this"
"1243030","1243230"," month."
"1243230","1247390"," They're in a 50 basis point hike based on Fed funds futures pricing."
"1248670","1254270"," Then comes out, SVB financials attempts to raise capital have failed. "
"1254850","1257610"," Does anybody remember that story from from back in 0708?"
"1258290","1261970"," We've heard that before and have hired advisors to seek a sale."
"1263730","1264570"," Who's going to buy that?"
"1265070","1265130"," Nobody."
"1268530","1274050"," Fed swaps fully priced in 25 basis point rate hike cut by year end. "
"1275910","1278050"," So now we can price that in, right?"
"1279370","1282590"," A rate cut by year end."
"1283250","1284270"," Will that get front run?"
"1286570","1290630"," SVB financial deposit outflows are outpacing the sale process."
"1293110","1298410"," CNBC, US Treasury Secretary Yellen, rise in labor force participation is encouraging. "
"1301490","1307750"," SVB 2033 bond spread widens to 1061 BPS indicating distress."
"1309230","1316050"," And then we've got Biden coming out to talk about the jobs data at 1045."
"1323320","1328860"," Spine out trading up to its one and five currently trading 390. "
"1330960","1333800"," Now we've got some changes coming to the stream as well."
"1334040","1335280"," We're going to make some changes here."
"1336180","1338140"," I was talking, I wrote this down. "
"1338300","1344720"," Let me see if I can find it here, but I was talking with someone this morning."
"1345460","1348640"," And as this channel grows, we're going to make some changes."
"1350840","1354720"," We're going to, if it doesn't work, we'll switch back to the old format. "
"1354720","1359080"," But this format here is going to switch to more of that."
"1359080","1361160"," I apologize for not having book map up for you."
"1361220","1362780"," I'm having some technical difficulties in the background. "
"1363380","1364440"," You'll have that up normally."
"1365440","1368880"," What we're going to do is we're going to try to slow the pace down."
"1369580","1374020"," As people join the stream, we're starting yesterday, we had a thousand people in here. "
"1374820","1378920"," And it's a little too much for me to be trading alongside with you trading."
"1379800","1382620"," And then the comments and I got a bunch of, I got people text messages."
"1382620","1386320"," I have people text messaging me all day long, and it's constant. "
"1386960","1389500"," There's a lot going on here as we grow."
"1390260","1393800"," Another issue we're having is people are trying to trade to me."
"1394560","1395700"," And that's an issue as well. "
"1396020","1398900"," And that involves this whole whole mother can of worms."
"1400840","1403280"," There's issues there too, which we'll talk about later."
"1403520","1410480"," But the idea here is this, is that we're going to start trading here in a five minute chart at"
"1410480","1410700"," least. "
"1411240","1416700"," We're going to cycle through the daily and hourly and then the 15 minute and try to trade a five"
"1416700","1418140"," minute chart so it's a little bit easier."
"1418480","1425820"," So you guys can catch a trend and maybe he trades something other than a zero date."
"1426460","1431120"," So if you guys are trading weeklies or monthlies or spreads or something like that, you can find a"
"1431120","1435800"," trend that's a little bit safer for you and not as fast for you to be trading. "
"1438790","1441570"," So we're going to try that format out this upcoming week."
"1444010","1449510"," Now the idea behind this is going to be, let me bring up some stuff in the background here."
"1451370","1452430"," We're going to go over that right. "
"1452550","1454970"," We're going to go over the brief outline of this over the next week."
"1479180","1481800"," And this way you're not getting cut out of trades."
"1482500","1483380"," Or at least not with me. "
"1483500","1487900"," I don't feel good with some of the stuff that I see."
"1487900","1488820"," I'm like, how are these people?"
"1489000","1490040"," I'm like, how are people not making money?"
"1490500","1491500"," I mean, this can't be hard."
"1492240","1493200"," And it is hard. "
"1493360","1493980"," It's not easy."
"1494980","1502000"," My expectation level is, or at least I'm here live streaming with you myself trading as a one date"
"1502000","1504440"," or not a one day, a one minute chart."
"1505400","1509640"," And if I have a five minute chart up for you and show you trend at least for one to"
"1509640","1516260"," three days, you should at least be able to follow along for one to three days. "
"1516260","1525140"," And it also opens us up to look at other tickers, take requests from you that you might want to"
"1525140","1525780"," see charted."
"1525920","1529400"," It gives time and room for us to breathe in stream."
"1530260","1535320"," Now, if other people want to trade zero dates on a one minute chart, you'll probably, I'll probably"
"1535320","1536700"," be doing that in the background as well. "
"1537400","1543100"," But at least publicly here in the stream, it's going to give you some breathing room to not get"
"1543100","1543660"," torched."
"1543660","1550660"," And I mean, things like not having stop limits, not understanding that 10 cuts you get one 300%"
"1550660","1551940"," winner on a zero date."
"1552240","1556580"," There's so many things like we're trading above how to take both sides of a trade up and down above"
"1556580","1558620"," and below a one or five minute line. "
"1559120","1563720"," The speed at which you need to do these things, all these, all these details to trading as this"
"1563720","1564360"," channel grows."
"1565180","1570300"," You can't just keep everybody on the same page and knowing how to do that day in day out."
"1570300","1572860"," It's just not going to work, at least from my end, it's not going to work. "
"1574780","1575540"," So we'll look at it."
"1575620","1576920"," This is a five minute chart right here."
"1578460","1580820"," We're going to get a five day chart here. "
"1581040","1581040"," Okay."
"1581820","1582360"," This is terrible."
"1583280","1583560"," This by. "
"1585560","1586980"," We'll give you some examples here."
"1587120","1587300"," Okay."
"1587920","1594740"," Now, if the white line is behind underneath the red line and the prices below it, we're going to"
"1594740","1595120"," trade it. "
"1595260","1595440"," Okay."
"1596020","1599360"," You got substantial time underneath this white line."
"1600020","1601420"," Now, normally in this stream. "
"1602960","1604460"," Here's a prime example, right?"
"1604680","1606740"," I'll trade this all day long on one minute."
"1607640","1611240"," But if you're in stream, this would be a time for you not to trade."
"1611960","1613720"," It'd be a great time for you. "
"1614280","1618960"," For us to at least look at other tickers or setups and things like that."
"1619220","1623380"," So you can kind of catch up or be with us in stream and know where we're going."
"1623380","1626020"," We'll bring a few banks and make issues at SVP financial. "
"1628160","1632880"," If you take a trade like this into the close, if you pick up the trade on the open, you"
"1632880","1634860"," know how long you can open when you get out of it."
"1635180","1637140"," And we'll be able to look at a larger time frame."
"1637740","1641440"," A 15 minute actually shows you for multiple days, two, three days. "
"1641740","1644580"," If we're going up overall or going down overall."
"1645380","1649300"," If price is overall trading underneath the one and five minute."
"1649300","1653000"," Then we'll box out everything for all box out everything for you for four three. "
"1653020","1658920"," The bus takes right using the triggers allows you to actually hear water flame futures for ex and"
"1658920","1659500"," stock instruments."
"1660000","1663200"," Now we're going to take a 15 minute card here, right?"
"1663740","1666660"," I want to know from you to you consider this bullish here."
"1667400","1670480"," And I'm going to bet that some of you do consider this bullish. "
"1670880","1676660"," But trend wise, if you're a new trader or you're not you're not used to trading the S&P 500."
"1676660","1676920"," hundred."
"1677320","1678900"," This is still bearish here. "
"1679680","1681000"," There's nothing bullish about this."
"1682060","1686420"," If anything, you're looking at T off on this red line right here and T off on this white line"
"1686420","1686820"," right here."
"1688480","1691380"," And you're looking for a reversal here on a 15 minute. "
"1691740","1693900"," You see how bullish a one minute looks right now?"
"1694020","1699260"," Very bullish to have bought this dip down below and then trade this up to this resistance point"
"1699260","1700380"," here and possibly even higher."
"1701120","1709180"," But on a larger time frame, it's not bullish and it crosses above the one and five and you see"
"1709180","1710180"," the one and five cross."
"1712760","1715180"," So just looking at this right here, right?"
"1715380","1721400"," You need to see this line come up and this line come up right here and you need to see"
"1721400","1726760"," price get above it and you can trade it on a short time frame, five minutes right?"
"1727180","1733300"," As long as price stays above the one minute here, you could trade this later on and expect it to"
"1733300","1739520"," run for a day, half a day, three days, something like that and get a weekly or a monthly and"
"1739520","1740260"," be just fine. "
"1741140","1746360"," Have a nice place, take a stop that rolls down on you and usually you'll see on a higher time"
"1746360","1748900"," frame a confirmation to take that trade."
"1750960","1756860"," When we're getting down inside of one one minute charts, I'm like, people are getting beat up me at"
"1756860","1757780"," the beginning of yesterday."
"1758440","1764860"," I think I boxed out to two trades and people are still getting cut up in that in those trades. "
"1764860","1767340"," And I'm like, yeah, as this grows, we can't keep doing that."
"1767540","1768540"," I can't keep doing it."
"1770620","1773440"," So what we'll do is we're going to change this format slightly. "
"1773680","1775260"," It gives us time to breathe too."
"1776040","1780480"," It gives us time to look at a trend for one, three days and a time for you to feel"
"1780480","1784420"," a little bit more bullish or bearish, not get shaken out."
"1784660","1790380"," As a matter of fact, yesterday, as we rolled over here yesterday, we would have seen that we're"
"1790380","1796700"," trading below prices trading below on a 15 minute, same on an hourly, same on a four hour and even"
"1796700","1803320"," on a daily, I think it comes out for a week ago, I posted for you that the moment we"
"1803320","1808080"," break through this, this is days and days back here, that we're bearish. "
"1808160","1809640"," Overall, we're bearish, right?"
"1809940","1811400"," And nothing's actually changed."
"1812380","1819820"," Even if I'm trading calls on a one day chart and a one minute chart and one day, the market"
"1819820","1821320"," is still overall bearish."
"1824430","1828570"," So just as the stream grows, we're probably going to switch, we'll check a daily, we'll check an"
"1828570","1832550"," hourly, we'll check a 15, a five minute, and we'll trade a five minute. "
"1834490","1844170"," So you can actually keep up with the pace and not get stopped out constantly or not pick the right"
"1844170","1847010"," price, 20 cents here, 10 cents there."
"1848270","1849910"," That's devastating to some people."
"1868580","1871580"," And let's just look at this in a one minute real quick so you can see it. "
"1873580","1878660"," You know, if we've taken this trade and now someone's saying, well, I'm bullish here, we are and"
"1878660","1878960"," we're not."
"1880020","1883440"," Do you know where the upper resistance levels are in one minute?"
"1883580","1884140"," Probably not."
"1886020","1892280"," And even if I draw them out on higher timeframes, you might think, Hey, we're going, we know we"
"1892280","1893500"," went up or we went up here. "
"1895220","1898400"," We went up here went up here and it's looking super bullish, right?"
"1898500","1919610"," This is just a one minute chart, you know, yeah,"
"1919770","1924690"," I had some technical difficulties trying to come live this morning, still having some."
"1937450","1941610"," So above right now, I'm going to show you some above targets here."
"1943990","1945230"," 395 11. "
"1968450","1971450"," This is your first or first row of sellers up here."
"1971610","1973290"," Okay, these are what your sellers are above."
"1974650","1976270"," They're waiting on high for you. "
"1976490","1978030"," They're leveling out a little bit."
"1981010","1983130"," But there's another rack just above them."
"1986320","1990960"," They're not as bearish as they were earlier with at least a momentum and trend. "
"1991600","1992520"," There's your next one."
"1992680","1995700"," This is your weekly or this is your monthly resistance right here."
"2000650","2002630"," Should daily resistance right here?"
"2002770","2004830"," Believe it or not, this becoming resistance on you. "
"2009690","2016410"," 39705 just above there taking a look at the fair and greed index showing 28 out of 100 equaling"
"2016410","2021390"," fear and the crypto fear and greed index 34 out of 100 also indicating fear."
"2025070","2026970"," This is where they teed off yesterday."
"2027830","2032610"," Remember when we were trading yesterday, we said to you, we need to build momentum to get above the"
"2032610","2033290"," daily trigger. "
"2034790","2037550"," And there's said these sellers are standing up here, right?"
"2038210","2040360"," Here's where the big sellers are right here in this market."
"2042620","2044740"," We call them swellers around here, right?"
"2048750","2050010"," And so they're right there."
"2050650","2051389"," This is where they are. "
"2051510","2052889"," They're just staying standing right here."
"2053389","2056590"," They want to keep the pressure on above here."
"2061010","2067110"," So no matter where these levels are here, S1, S2, you see pivot points, previous lows, stuff like"
"2067110","2070710"," that, you should know that these these sellers are here. "
"2070909","2073070"," No matter what you think, they're right here."
"2080850","2082870"," Your hourly trend is right here."
"2083170","2084710"," Your daily trend is right here. "
"2085270","2086889"," Your weekly trend is right here."
"2088690","2091949"," And above that, you've got, I said this was daily."
"2092530","2095150"," This isn't your swellers, the swellers are now higher slightly. "
"2095389","2096850"," This is your monthly trend right here."
"2099450","2112470"," 399.98. They're"
"2112470","2112810"," right here."
"2120810","2123930"," It's a pretty significant stack of sellers up here, right?"
"2124610","2127510"," They're waiting to tee off on you to go lower from here. "
"2130930","2132710"," That's pretty significant right here."
"2132890","2140170"," So even your one in five minute, on a five minute chart here, you're looking at selling people or"
"2140170","2142510"," at least sellers in this market trying to sell into you."
"2143010","2146010"," It's showing you that the way is down and not up right now. "
"2149950","2152810"," If we come up into you, they're going to try to feed into you."
"2153110","2156210"," If you want to get bullish again, where is it?"
"2156530","2160290"," So on a one hour chart here, you can see it, right?"
"2161710","2167750"," This is a one hour chart and you can see what you need to actually get above to become, if"
"2167750","2176010"," this was price here, it's going to show you what you need to actually get above and reach out to"
"2176010","2179990"," China and hold for bullishness again."
"2183460","2185540"," You know, hourly trend right there, right?"
"2189670","2190530"," Hold on here. "
"2198010","2202790"," See the work that needs to be done for you to begin and to bounce off of for this market"
"2202790","2204050"," to begin to become bullish again."
"2204910","2208030"," So if you're, if you're even like, if you're like, you know what, that was all bullshit."
"2208030","2209050"," You know, the banking isn't it?"
"2209190","2214230"," If you're like, Hey, cap, the banking crypto things was just a scam headline to sell the market. "
"2214630","2217750"," You couldn't do it during the Senate so they're using that as a scam line."
"2217950","2221630"," And the 50 BPS was a scam line as well."
"2223110","2226190"," Stir some shit up, put some some fear out there in the market. "
"2228870","2234830"," Then you should see us trade above today, tomorrow, next day."
"2237190","2247150"," If you don't see us trade above, if you don't see us trade above here, I mean"
"2247150","2256890"," like next day or two today, Friday, Monday, and not only trade above but hold above"
"2256890","2257530"," here, right?"
"2258330","2261790"," If you can't hold this above here, the move is still down."
"2263350","2265310"," And the liquidation of XLF is showing that. "
"2266150","2270150"," And yet more than I haven't looked, I looked earlier this morning, very early this morning,"
"2270150","2274930"," actually, but here's a whole bunch of sectors just waiting to sell down of near zero."
"2276770","2279130"," That'll ride the spy down over time here."
"2292230","2295770"," Here's March 17th, here's March 31st. "
"2296890","2298990"," S one, S two, S three."
"2299210","2299590"," Look at that."
"2299870","2308830"," For today's pivot points, we've got three 76 is for one day, three, three, 55. "
"2310270","2311950"," And as we're already at S one, right?"
"2312110","2316710"," Already on the open this morning, S one, three, seven, 53 down below."
"2317170","2318050"," This is one day."
"2329870","2331310"," We're already down here, right?"
"2331850","2335130"," You get S three S three down here with our previous support. "
"2335130","2342830"," Another thing that happened yesterday was I heard people say, well, we're back to the lows from"
"2342830","2344010"," seven days ago."
"2344730","2346830"," I was like, yeah, we are on the indexes."
"2348210","2358030"," But they went in and they cleaned out a bunch of tickers to December lows, October"
"2358030","2362610"," lows, and some tickers all the way back to March 20 lows. "
"2365170","2369130"," So there was that there was some house cleaning going on in the market yesterday."
"2370310","2373690"," That was that was never talked about yesterday at all."
"2373810","2374850"," I didn't see it talked about. "
"2375310","2380570"," So if you went into some individual tickers, this was actually came back to December, in sectors."
"2381930","2389670"," And then tickers came back to just October lows, and some tickers all the way back to March 2020."
"2390510","2397010"," So there's some some under the hood stuff inside the market that that's not doesn't smell right at"
"2397010","2397550"," this point. "
"2398870","2403490"," Now with that said, as well, we talked about, I think"
"2403490","2413090"," we've been breaking below weekly and monthly"
"2413090","2413570"," support."
"2414430","2415650"," We're bringing this up for you here."
"2423210","2432830"," If we break below weekly and monthly support, then watch this hourly coming down and breaking"
"2432830","2433610"," through right now. "
"2433990","2436470"," This is trend and watch this daily right here."
"2436510","2437790"," See this yellow and green line."
"2437930","2441830"," These are very important to you as an investor and trader. "
"2443230","2446310"," I'm going to highlight these for you."
"2449570","2456770"," See this green line right here is the actual direction of the market right here."
"2457470","2458410"," You can see it. "
"2459050","2459990"," It's come right down."
"2460130","2465850"," We talked we discussed if we just if we just stick our head underneath here, that it's different"
"2465850","2468450"," than a big push down below."
"2469170","2471350"," We talked about that into the end of February. "
"2472210","2475870"," We talked about the destruction of support."
"2477590","2481590"," This is I believe this is coming into the 28th attack attack attack."
"2481810","2484890"," It must hold and get a new high get above this yellow line. "
"2484970","2489450"," We didn't do that right came in the end of the month and they just started hammering and hammering."
"2489690","2491290"," They're literally hammering on."
"2491630","2496130"," They're selling into the demand for monthly and weekly support. "
"2498270","2499830"," Weakening these buyers here."
"2500010","2504590"," And sure enough, you see above they came back down and we're able to break through with some force"
"2504590","2504870"," here."
"2505030","2507870"," Now they're underneath known support. "
"2508250","2510590"," What does that mean to you?"
"2510870","2520570"," And I'm going to show what that means to you that weekly and monthly support."
"2520590","2523630"," This is the S&P 500 on a day-to-day basis."
"2524430","2526450"," They're not only hammering. "
"2526650","2529410"," They're getting underneath the yellow line, the trend."
"2530190","2533850"," They're getting underneath the weekly trend."
"2534270","2536170"," And then they're getting underneath the monthly trend. "
"2536810","2541230"," When they do this with price, price comes over and gets hung up underneath."
"2542270","2543890"," It leads to bad things normally."
"2546390","2550090"," This market, if you're a bull, you want to stay above these lines here. "
"2551430","2555370"," You want to stay above this trend here for a normalized market."
"2555610","2558110"," And when you don't, I'm going to show you what happens."
"2558290","2558670"," We plunge. "
"2561110","2565630"," It marks pretty significant plunging events inside of this market going back to stores."
"2565630","2571670"," Oil loading from Russia's Black Sea port of Nourashovic suspended on March 10 due to storm."
"2572290","2580270"," Being below this blue line and that orange line, your weekly and monthly supports leads you to a"
"2580270","2581510"," three month support. "
"2582010","2583750"," That three month support is somewhere down here."
"2584890","2586570"," I'll put it up for you one day."
"2587690","2589430"," But look at price as it gets underneath. "
"2590310","2592650"," We get violent down moves by to the tick."

"2599990","2601570"," You can see it as well."
"2602590","2604610"," It back in 2022, right?"
"2604730","2605310"," We break below. "
"2605750","2608670"," This was our first violent move to the weekly or the monthly."
"2608890","2610550"," We get another one below the monthly."
"2610830","2611310"," This was devastating. "
"2611650","2612530"," I remember this."
"2612890","2614130"," We had a summertime run."
"2614310","2617890"," We blasted down into October below this blue line, right?"
"2618010","2618810"," It's pretty significant. "
"2619590","2623210"," There was fair and panic in December when we were down here consolidating, right?"
"2623710","2625190"," Are we going to start blasting lower?"
"2625350","2626230"," Remember that in December?"
"2626930","2629490"," And we watched the market breath get bought up."
"2630210","2633510"," We need to be looking for that if we do buy up market breath down here."
"2633530","2635590"," But if we don't, then we can't reclaim this stuff. "
"2635910","2640750"," And I was looking at friends that were putting on trades at the close yesterday, some big trades."
"2641510","2648790"," And they weren't trading that they were doing strangles on the market from 196 down to 340 into mid "
"2648790","2649110","-April."
"2651760","2658820"," Professional traders are 396 down here to 340 by mid-April down here. "
"2659120","2662340"," And Yellen says the most inflation we've seen reflects supply side issues."
"2662840","2663820"," You know, strangle me."
"2663980","2666720"," We can go right below this, come right back up into mid-April. "
"2667560","2669040"," And they're going to make bank in here."
"2669840","2673940"," But their strangles aren't above 496."
"2676380","2684180"," It's likely due to the smashing of this level here, the damage that was done to this support of the"
"2684180","2684520"," market. "
"2691670","2692150"," Thanks."
"2692270","2693930"," I'm going to show you guys one more thing here."
"2739530","2744410"," In this line right here, if you look at this white line right here, it's significantly lower here,"
"2744650","2744690"," right?"
"2744950","2752130"," This is that currently it sits at 336 down here. "
"2754510","2761080"," And we're below all these moving averages here."
"2761240","2762360"," This would be the attempt, right?"
"2762480","2766240"," You take it down into 335.75 currently."
"2767360","2770560"," And today, either the end of this corner or even summertime. "
"2771740","2774480"," That's where your real next support is for this market."
"2774660","2781380"," As long as we stay under 396, 400, the longer we stay under there, the more the trap door is"
"2781380","2784560"," open to down below to that number right down here."
"2789580","2792440"," There's your tag right there for the COVID low. "
"2794980","2796720"," To that COVID low right there."
"2806810","2808810"," Blasted right through it here in June of 08."
"2809230","2811070"," This went to a six month or a year low. "
"2811190","2811570"," I can't remember."
"2812570","2814890"," Even lower down here in 0708."
"2816290","2819790"," We haven't even tagged the one yet for this low here. "
"2823370","2826730"," So if there's no dysfunction in the market, you're going to at least see this."
"2827010","2828470"," You're going to at least see this down here."
"2828910","2832950"," It's going to be no big deal getting down here to 3300. "
"2855350","2857650"," And you can see how sickly it looks right now."
"2858450","2860210"," That's a P500 sickly right now."
"2860310","2860850"," Guarantee it. "
"2863050","2865650"," There was no blast off on the bell this morning."
"2900570","2907270"," If you're looking to trade the five minute today, you want to see this this formation right here."
"2907330","2907890"," You want to see. "
"2921950","2924490"," You want to see price get above the one and the two."
"2925130","2927850"," Check the one minute and then come up higher here."
"2932490","2934250"," Now it's moving nice and slow too. "
"2934370","2936630"," I like seeing this moving nice and slow for you."
"2945370","2947410"," And if you don't see that, it's bearish."
"2950740","2952320"," You can see it right here, right?"
"2952480","2953560"," This is bearish right here. "
"2953620","2955920"," Until we break above this, it's not it's not bullish."
"2964610","2966750"," Or I guess on some time frames, it's bullish."
"2967010","2972370"," But you know, on a time frame that can be handled by anyone watching this show, it's not. "
"2996920","2999800"," Yeah, I connect mobile saying, I think CAP talks about MBI."
"3000220","3001560"," I'll bring up the MBI real quick."
"3003280","3011580"," So the MBI by zone, as soon as we get underneath that 10%, we start we start slamming on all"
"3011580","3013040"," these sectors all one time. "
"3013280","3015100"," We'll look at that right now."
"3017840","3023900"," You guys, I missed the trade in December because we didn't quite get down there enough."
"3044230","3045950"," Here they are right here. "
"3047250","3056410"," Utilities right now is that 13.3. Tech, I believe, is that 16.4. Look at real estate."
"3057090","3061250"," Zero able to launch negotiations on trade agreements on critical minerals."
"3061850","3063270"," Materials 10. "
"3064150","3065990"," Industrial's 24."
"3066730","3069950"," HLT to 12.5. Finance."
"3070870","3071890"," Big fat zero. "
"3073370","3074910"," Financials zero."
"3076210","3087670"," Energy 8.7. Consumer staples 15.2. Communications"
"3087670","3088650"," 12."
"3090470","3099510"," Consumer discretionary 5.3. So what would you expect in here is we need to bleed off industrials. "
"3100730","3103490"," Still, believe it or not, we need to bleed off tech."
"3104390","3105690"," Believe it or not, we're not there yet."
"3109340","3114680"," And when we do get those capitulation moves, those liquidation moments, you'll see this chart here. "
"3114760","3122350"," Let me see if I can you'll actually see this."
"3122510","3123510"," And look, we've broken through it."
"3123630","3124750"," We've said we've broken through all. "
"3124890","3125770"," This is the low rate here."
"3126690","3128350"," We're now below 618."
"3130990","3134750"," We're looking for 384.37. 375. "
"3136870","3139290"," 375.01 for the whole move."
"3142910","3147730"," 375.38. And that would be your December move."
"3148810","3149990"," Get rid of your October move. "
"3150170","3158920"," That's 348.34. Remember those lines that I have above here, right?"
"3159000","3160140"," Your weekly stuff up here."
"3161980","3164680"," All that stuff, all that resistance above."
"3171880","3173100"," We stay outside. "
"3173580","3176900"," If we stay below this this this balance area in here, right?"
"3177620","3179760"," We start looking for this to become the balance area."
"3179980","3180520"," Does that make sense?"
"3181580","3190490"," So even if we tag this nice little like true range over here, right?"
"3190730","3192090"," This nice little true range room here."
"3192530","3198530"," But if we start making a ceiling up here, this becomes our next range down below, doesn't it?"
"3198750","3200890"," We start trading down here, filling all this in. "
"3202710","3209210"," If we start breaking down here, we'll start heading lower and filling some of the gaps we've left"
"3209210","3210230"," behind at this point."
"3211930","3225840"," So the"
"3225840","3227320"," move is not higher here, right?"
"3227640","3228380"," I want you to look at that."
"3228520","3229540"," I want you to see that. "
"3230520","3233700"," If we're here, if we're in here, trading this zone right here, right?"
"3235640","3237440"," Let's say we're trading this zone right here."
"3238040","3242480"," That you're saying that we're going to trade this zone to break above and be able to move higher,"
"3242480","3242900"," right?"
"3243540","3248340"," So if you're not seeing that right now, all I'm asking you to do is hold 400."
"3249200","3250220"," Can you hold 400?"
"3250580","3251320"," And the answer is no. "
"3251320","3257360"," So if we can't hold 400 right now, they're going to go to the path of least resistance, and that"
"3257360","3257920"," is down."
"3258820","3267320"," We've been rejected above now once, twice, three times, four times, and they're telling you that"
"3267320","3268720"," the way is down right now."
"3269480","3272020"," So they're likely going to check this down below here. "
"3274500","3284080"," That's 375.94. We're likely going to check this down here, two, three, four, fifty, three, 375."
"3284400","3286120"," All this stuff is getting checked down here."
"3288220","3292560"," Without a doubt, today, tomorrow, next week, I don't know when, but we're going to check this. "
"3293120","3295920"," It could be today, it could be over the weekend, it could be Monday or Tuesday."
"3296980","3299960"," They're going to want to know because we got told no up here, we got told no right here."
"3300780","3305900"," We got blasted down in one day, every the VIX, 18% yesterday. "
"3307540","3310440"," If you look historically, we get an 18% day in the VIX."
"3312140","3318200"," We usually get a green candle up, either today or Monday, and then we find out right away if we"
"3318200","3319480"," start blasting down here."
"3320740","3327780"," We're either going to hold above and move higher, but if we don't, that next green candle, if it's"
"3327780","3330980"," today or Monday, usually leads to a swift reversal. "
"3338140","3339740"," And there it is right there, right?"
"3339900","3340500"," Today or tomorrow."
"3340500","3345400"," So that kind of leads you to this point of what our seller is thinking."
"3346280","3348600"," They're like, yeah, we'll let them get up here, right?"
"3348720","3349820"," We'll let them squeeze this up. "
"3350640","3353740"," And then we're going to step right back in and try to sell this down again."
"3358160","3362120"," So you get your one big green candle day, you're out there fist pumping and all that stuff."
"3362520","3364440"," You're like, woo, bull market's still open. "
"3367670","3372990"," So you can't like claim victory here the next couple of days, unless you actually get up here."
"3375330","3376490"," And hold it."
"3377830","3379190"," And then take it higher. "
"3380390","3386650"," If you can't do that, it's just a matter of re-shoring the market down to lower lows to check"
"3386650","3387610"," that three 74."
"3413310","3414410"," Let me just say it here."
"3414450","3415350"," We do some work in the background. "
"3432950","3442850"," Saying breaking US non-farm payrolls actual 311,000 forecast 225,000, previous 517,000"
"3442850","3447870"," revised from 504,000."
"3462570","3463670"," We just second here."
"3575940","3579500"," So we are surely expecting comments from Biden as he speaks on the jobs data. "
"3594610","3598190"," Mary, you're, uh, Mary, your comments right now."
"3610160","3611220"," Yeah, you know what?"
"3611440","3617760"," So right now, uh, tech is looking stronger than than the S&P 500 right now."
"3618400","3624700"," But you can see that there's a little bit more, uh, vig inside of the tech right now. "
"3625500","3627960"," It's running around 13 to 15%."
"3629260","3632160"," It is looking stronger overall than the S&P."
"3638910","3642850"," So we have posted out the link to Biden speaking on the jobs reports on the news feed. "
"3643010","3643870"," Those are interested."
"3648470","3650230"," Hey, uh, wonder, wonder bread."
"3650450","3650910"," That's not real. "
"3651090","3651330"," Is it?"
"3651390","3651850"," Is that real?"
"3653350","3655610"," Are you being serious in the chat right now?"
"3656450","3657370"," Are you okay?"
"3662890","3664350"," Winky, you want to check on him?"
"3670660","3671640"," Oh, it's lyrics."
"3672540","3673200"," I got you."
"3674620","3675900"," It's lyrics to a song. "
"3677240","3677920"," My bad."
"3698770","3702790"," I'm going to hear in my, my, we got a, we got a snowstorm coming in right now."
"3704190","3705870"," Yeah, that's kind of a crazy song, right?"
"3707170","3709230"," Life's got to suck if you got that song going on. "
"3718130","3719970"," We're here for a good time, that a long time."
"3723390","3725190"," Let's throw some targets down below."
"3728650","3753810"," Three, eighty four, seventy six, three, seventy"
"3753810","3754850"," five, thirty nine. "
"3760100","3760700"," That's low."
"3797130","3802930"," And what I'll do with you now, I was supposed to go skiing this weekend for a couple of days."
"3802930","3807830"," I'm going to try to take a, I'm going to try to take one of those days and we're going"
"3807830","3810050"," to look at, uh, put back spreads. "
"3810050","3817090"," I don't know what, what's best for you guys is Saturday morning or Sunday morning better because"
"3817090","3823830"," what I think what we're going to do is, uh, the beginning of 2022, 2022, yeah, it's the right year."
"3824330","3830150"," Uh, the beginning of 2022, we placed some put back spreads on the market."
"3831170","3838850"," Um, the first rollover in the market when it came back up, uh, we, we placed put back spreads and"
"3838850","3840250"," they basically look like this. "
"3844050","3847090"," I'll give you the general idea of a put back spread."
"3848610","3853890"," Now pretend this is a, I guess maybe it's just making a large, our larger chart."
"3860110","3867330"," So in a put back spread, if we have a snapback higher, right, if you're a snapback, snapback trade"
"3867330","3876850"," here higher and you're anticipating more down, you'd take that snapback, or not snapback, uh, it's"
"3876850","3877890"," basically a ratio spread. "
"3878270","3888910"," So you do put back spread up here and if the market goes higher, if the,"
"3888930","3897910"," if you place the trade somewhere in here, if the market goes higher, uh, your, your puts will be"
"3897910","3898170"," free."
"3899050","3899970"," It'll pay for the trade."
"3900530","3901530"," So you don't lose any money. "
"3902850","3905070"," So price goes higher in the market."
"3905930","3907210"," Uh, the trade is free."
"3907650","3909990"," You might make a little extra depending on how high we go. "
"3912260","3913840"," You place them out in time."
"3914240","3916820"," They're fairly cheap, they're not, they're not ridiculously expensive."
"3917460","3923260"," Uh, now if we go down, we start to have a leg down in this quarter or the year. "
"3924920","3930900"," If it's the summer, it's basically a free trade on the market."
"3930900","3934380"," What you do is, some of you in the stream probably remember this trade."
"3935520","3941440"," Uh, so if the market is rolling over, what happens is this on a high, if the market starts to"
"3941440","3946880"," blast down, uh, you print significant amounts of money on, on a, on a downward move. "
"3947120","3953620"," If it lasts in the summer, if it lasts in the fall, if it lasts into winter, if you place"
"3953620","3960000"," the trade for the whole entire year, as long as we head down, uh, you're going to make a ton"
"3960000","3960300"," of money."
"3961440","3968100"," If we come back up here at any point and start, start racing higher, the trade becomes at least"
"3968100","3972520"," free with a, you make a little bit like five, 10%, three percent, something like that."
"3973000","3977260"," You pay for the, it pays for the trade and it pays, it's, it's almost a free trade. "
"3977540","3978500"," You avoid it, not almost."
"3978820","3979560"," It is a free trade."
"3980460","3983900"," As long as you're expecting significant downward movement in the market. "
"3985540","3986980"," It's a nice hedge on the market."
"3987140","3990020"," It's even better than estau calls, believe it or not."
"3990020","3992260"," Triple average calls for June, they're good. "
"3992520","3995320"," But the best ones are put back spreads, ratio spreads."
"3996740","4002180"," So what we'll do is either Saturday morning, can, Winky, can you, I'll run the, I'll run it, or"
"4002180","4003620"," Winky, can you run a poll on Twitch?"
"4005260","4007780"," Or can you, or I don't know how to run a poll yet on Twitch."
"4008940","4011780"," And maybe I'll run one on, on YouTube or my end. "
"4012840","4014220"," But you got, I'm going to run a poll."
"4014780","4018260"," I'll be here on Saturday or Sunday morning, whatever you prefer, because we're snowing all"
"4018260","4019980"," weekends, dumping rate, where I'm at."
"4020360","4021320"," It's dumping all weekends. "
"4021800","4028820"," So I'll make Saturday or Sunday morning available, whatever you choose."
"4028820","4035600"," And we'll go through put back spreads, how to place them, how to manage them, as a hedge on the"
"4035600","4037540"," market for this year."
"4042610","4043890"," I'll run a poll right now. "
"4043890","4044770"," Hold on, I'll do YouTube."
"4094540","4097180"," So I just, I just asked the question on YouTube, at least."
"4097180","4102240"," Would you want to have a put back spread show on Saturday a.m. or Sunday a.m. For those"
"4102240","4106840"," of you that want to see that show that don't know what ratio spreads are, want to learn about ratio"
"4106840","4108939"," spreads, want to learn how to hedge the market. "
"4111260","4116160"," Any of you super duper bulls out there that think we're going all time highs right now, no landing,"
"4116380","4116939"," that kind of stuff."
"4120770","4122950"," But you don't want to get torched in case we go down."
"4126520","4134899"," If you can ask and say, if we can, if you could ask, do a poll inside of a twitch"
"4134899","4138040"," and we'll find out, I'll leave this poll open for the next five minutes or so. "
"4141020","4142560"," See where they are right here, right?"
"4143340","4144819"," There's not a two hour chart right now."
"4145560","4147920"," Just coming right over this market right here, right?"
"4148080","4149300"," I swooped down on top of you."
"4149300","4158420"," Yeah, slower chart here too, right?"
"4159020","4160779"," Let all this build up for a squeeze higher. "
"4206470","4209150"," Price trying to break above the one and five right now."
"4209170","4212250"," We'll see if the one minute can start to squeeze up the market right here."
"4214510","4218970"," We're looking for a price to go above the five minute, come back and recheck the one minute,"
"4219230","4237170"," starting to develop right now, starting to"
"4237170","4239090"," squeeze right now above the five minute. "
"4239090","4244340"," I need to change these, what they look like."
"4244660","4245920"," Put it back to the one minute for you."
"4246420","4254420"," There goes the squeeze and you want to see price come back down and you just check. "
"4254500","4258380"," The web button hasn't started, these are remarks on the February job support just yet."
"4260040","4261780"," Now, this looks bullish to you, right?"
"4261980","4266400"," You still want to see this come back and check back to this one minute chart right now, but what"
"4266400","4271980"," you want to see is you want to see price come back down here, check for a move higher."
"4274380","4275720"," That looks pretty bullish, right?"
"4276000","4276780"," This is a one minute chart. "
"4277740","4279600"," We normally trade this all the time."
"4279640","4285700"," I trade this all the time in here, but if you look at a five minute here, still not quite"
"4285700","4286360"," there, is it?"
"4304930","4323810"," Back to a five minute here and five"
"4323810","4332410"," to seven, right up here, three, nine, five, two, seven."
"4335670","4386080"," All right,"
"4386080","4386960"," let me check this poll. "
"4399160","4413520"," So on YT, we've got 60% of you seeing Sunday, Saturday,"
"4413520","4414040"," 40%."
"4417120","4421840"," Wink, did you do a poll, Winkie, in Twitch by chance?"
"4442620","4445960"," Yeah, I'll post it on YouTube for you."
"4445960","4446980"," I'm largely resolved. "
"4459590","4460750"," Oh, you closed it."
"4460970","4462730"," So I don't think we did one for Twitch, did I?"
"4463750","4467210"," I don't think I did one for Twitch that stream is sponsored by Ticksright."

"4472990","4475110"," Get a free trial at Ticksright.com."
"4475790","4478030"," Let me just see if I can do one just for Twitch."
"4479170","4480130"," I'll just combine the two."
"4485350","4486610"," I don't know how to do this. "
"4487930","4489690"," Maybe, maybe Winkie can help us out."
"4492810","4495090"," Okay, let's do it again then, Winkie."
"4509150","4511750"," So someone just said no patience now, right?"
"4512190","4515110"," We just threw this out for you earlier, what you're looking for here, right?"
"4515950","4517810"," You're looking for this line to come up. "
"4522270","4523330"," Looking for this line."
"4523490","4528090"," Just as we set three gallons as prioritizing, it's not a solution to the debt ceiling issue."
"4530990","4540790"," Yeah, if I had to guess, the Fed is going to be like, we need to tamp down that"
"4540790","4541090"," bank. "
"4541370","4543270"," We need to tamp down that bank stuff."
"4543890","4546870"," If I had to guess, there's panic behind closed doors."
"4548590","4552750"," But they don't want that getting out. "
"4553130","4559250"," I'm betting right now that there's panic somewhere saying, yes, we like that you got the market"
"4559250","4561870"," underneath by calling for bank or bank."
"4563490","4568490"," Problems, but I guarantee somewhere there's someone panicking that if that gets out publicly."
"4571830","4575130"," Or if enough they can, you know, filly on Main Street knows that. "
"4577530","4579950"," Because there are something, people are not smart."
"4580590","4583070"," People will be like, get my money out of the banks right now."
"4583270","4584390"," I went through 0708. "
"4584590","4588270"," Give me money out of the stock market."
"4591610","4593290"," I don't care what they say."
"4597500","4599500"," So right in here, you're seeing this develop, right?"
"4603850","4605190"," You want to see this development?"
"4605190","4607210"," This is the consolidation we talk about. "
"4609490","4616990"," If this, if this consolidation holds, bam, bam, and starts taking off."
"4617050","4622670"," You can set a trade-off, you know, if we stay above that white line, then you're probably pretty"
"4622670","4623530"," good for some time."
"4624370","4630970"," You could probably get a weekly and then cut your losses on that white line as we head up. "
"4632230","4634410"," Or take the other side of the trade and stay in it."
"4634810","4635910"," You can actually just buy the spy."
"4636470","4639870"," You know, if you got, if you got a few hundred bucks inside your bank account, right, you can just"
"4639870","4640550"," buy the spy. "
"4641430","4642290"," Buy one share."
"4645450","4648270"," And put a stop-loss on it if you roll underneath it."
"4663830","4671090"," Sweet, I think I appreciate you putting the, I appreciate you putting that Saturday or Sunday poll"
"4671090","4671550"," back up. "
"4686170","4692330"," Yeah, so you type in the exclamation point, vote, space bar, S-U-N or S-A-T."
"4703610","4707190"," We're going to switch back and forth between the one and the five so you can see what this looks"
"4707190","4709530"," like on a different time frame here."
"4712230","4714590"," You know, we got the nice dragging up in here. "
"4714870","4715750"," Woohoo, we made a bunch of money."
"4715750","4717590"," Woohoo, I entered the wrong time."
"4717830","4719890"," Woohoo, I didn't sell out, right?"
"4720990","4722750"," I didn't take the money where I'm getting cut up in here. "
"4724550","4725710"," I'm on a five minute chart."
"4731360","4749580"," You're actually waiting for, you're"
"4749580","4750840"," actually not even in this trade yet, are you?"
"4751620","4755420"," You're waiting for price to get above the white line, right?"
"4757720","4762000"," You want to see price confirm the one minute above the five minute."
"4763840","4767700"," As it takes off, it should continue every 15 minutes, right?"
"4768640","4772580"," The hourly is 930, 1030, 1130, 1230. "
"4773440","4776480"," Stops underneath, you raise your stops as we make our way."
"4777440","4779980"," You're probably not going to make 100%."
"4780840","4784040"," You're probably going to make 10, 20, 30%, but it's a safer trade. "
"4789270","4794730"," And if it continues for a day or two and you're in a weekly or monthly, you're going to be"
"4794730","4800610"," able to withstand some of this price action and feel more confidently some price action."
"4800710","4802310"," You shouldn't even be taking this trade yet."
"4802810","4808250"," You're still looking for this to happen. "
"4808910","4813010"," You're still looking for this to happen."
"4814570","4818030"," Then you're looking for price to confirm on the one minute above the five."
"4818570","4821730"," I'll just leave this up here for a minute while that poll is being run. "
"4822650","4824830"," This drawing here, so you can see it."
"4827340","4831380"," This is your your your bold cross right here, right?"
"4831520","4833520"," There's a bull's crossover on a five minute chart."
"4835300","4838880"," There's your bearish crossover on a bear on a five minute chart. "
"4842910","4846550"," Now, if you're trading zero dates in a five minute chart, you're going to get torn up."
"4846870","4848010"," They're going to rip the pieces."
"4848850","4852550"," They're only good for the for the time that you're in them. "
"4852850","4856550"," So if you're you're in one push up, they're good for that that time frame."
"4856550","4862470"," You can't sometimes you can, but for in trend day, you can sit in zero dates, but normally you"
"4862470","4862910"," can't."
"4863010","4865130"," Normally, it's just that one move on a one minute chart. "
"4866430","4868530"," Five minute chart, you wait for confirmation."
"4869510","4871190"," We start trading above this white line."
"4871230","4872930"," You can buy a weekly or a monthly. "
"4874430","4876950"," And as long as you're above that white line, you're good to go."
"4882030","4884230"," And it trades hell of a lot slower."
"4886230","4886970"," Five minutes. "
"4889430","4901270"," So I"
"4901270","4902390"," should have left that up there for you."
"4927730","4930270"," Yeah, the one minute needs to be retested."
"4939000","4941400"," Well, it has actually on a one minute chart, it has. "
"4943700","4945140"," But we're not going to trade that here."
"4945280","4945920"," Not today."
"4946540","4948460"," We'll switch back and forth to the one minute. "
"4952190","4953670"," It has it has retort."
"4953870","4955030"," It is retesting right now."
"4956650","4961170"," S.V.B.E.K. says it's ring fence from parent on other subsidiaries. "
"4963310","4965370"," I'll show you what it looks like on a one minute chart."
"4970900","4973820"," So price is above the one in five right now."
"4974400","4977360"," You see it see the crossover happening on a one minute chart. "
"4978220","4980780"," Target above is three ninety four ninety three."
"4981480","4984500"," Now what happens is I think we get people in stream here."
"4984660","4987400"," They we bounce back down here and they panic. "
"4988600","4991140"," Or they don't know where to put stops in down below here."
"4991420","4993700"," Or we get a liquidation break right here and they get panicky, right?"
"5018610","5022810"," Now 11.08. Five minutes gaining some strength."
"5023130","5024090"," Hourly is gaining some strength. "
"5050000","5054740"," So Bodden has now come to the stand to make his remarks on the February jobs report."
"5058580","5069410"," I want"
"5069410","5070470"," you to look over here too."
"5070630","5071490"," I want you to take a look at this. "
"5071750","5072970"," See how he squeeze up?"
"5074250","5075810"," There's a squeeze up right here."
"5076430","5078310"," Immediately thrown back down and below."
"5078610","5079510"," What didn't happen here?"
"5079590","5080930"," Do you guys know what didn't happen here?"
"5083930","5086430"," You didn't have the one you didn't have the one minute come above. "
"5086730","5087630"," You see that one minute here?"
"5088630","5089990"," Just one minute right there."
"5090610","5091810"," That one minute it held."
"5092730","5094510"," You would have had a price bounce right here. "
"5096030","5097270"," That's what you're looking for here."
"5097430","5100670"," You're looking for this price bounce onto the one minute and for it to hold."
"5101390","5102870"," And the one minute to cross up higher. "
"5103690","5104910"," The other one minute didn't cross there."
"5105030","5105910"," Let me show it to you real quick."
"5106770","5107730"," See how right here?"
"5107850","5108350"," You didn't see this. "
"5108410","5109630"," You didn't see this one minute."
"5109930","5111490"," Confirm the move higher."
"5112410","5115330"," You didn't see the one minute trade higher with price. "
"5116310","5117890"," And we're right there again right now."
"5117970","5119950"," You can see the same formation right here."
"5120210","5121410"," So you want to look at this right here. "
"5121590","5122770"," See that same formation?"
"5123490","5125410"," You have that same formation right here."
"5126370","5127470"," Let's go either way, right?"
"5127670","5130570"," Bodden says the jobs report shows his economic plan is working."
"5184750","5191430"," Yeah, you know what someone just someone just said XLF is really what you need to watch. "
"5191610","5194410"," Regaining the 50 DMA would be a vote of conference for the bulls."
"5194450","5195670"," It's been strong all morning."
"5196310","5198870"," I'm actually looking for the I'm looking for it. "
"5199050","5200470"," I'm looking to sell this market when we hit."
"5202150","5203590"," What did I say I think I was looking for?"
"5204150","5206230"," He has like a look at it right now and check."
"5209800","5215040"," As a matter of fact, if you if you see historically an XLF when it sold off like it did"
"5215040","5222020"," historically, you look pull up a one day chart of XLF and look back on the past five years. "
"5222020","5223680"," You get a red bar like we did yesterday?"
"5223920","5225820"," Every single time we roll this market over."
"5226780","5227840"," Every single time."
"5229800","5231540"," Not a single instance of us not. "
"5235620","5236980"," We're right there right now."
"5254300","5258000"," Bodden says the February jobs report shows your economy is moving in the right direction."
"5259940","5263300"," And Bodden says there's still more work to do to get inflation down more. "
"5273430","5275150"," Yeah, 35 bucks to be nice."
"5276010","5282690"," Just the failure to close 35 dollars like 3450, 3434 somewhere in there any of that stuff."
"5297810","5300690"," Yeah, I think it's right around there 3434 somewhere in there. "
"5300730","5301930"," Some kind of failure to close above."
"5304670","5306170"," Yeah, 3481 or whatever."
"5318380","5319920"," There's a gap up there, right?"
"5320040","5323720"," There's a gap on XLF between 3487, 3439. "
"5324840","5327560"," Just a failure to close that gap and then roll it right over."
"5352030","5355070"," What's the what's the poll results?"
"5357750","5360050"," How do I how do I close that man?"
"5360150","5361270"," I got to find out where that."
"5364730","5366890"," How do I close the poll on the back end of this. "
"5367070","5379760"," Can I see"
"5379760","5381620"," the I saw that you closed that already wink."
"5381960","5383560"," I got to figure that out on the back end here."
"5384520","5387760"," I was looking on the left hand side for like is it cloud box man's?"
"5387840","5388200"," I don't know. "
"5396230","5398330"," All right, sweet 73% Sunday."
"5398590","5404630"," So I'll make the video on Sunday morning and I'll make sure that it's available on Twitch and"
"5404630","5407850"," YouTube I'll save it to YouTube videos for you."
"5408500","5416410"," So you can look at putback spreads in the market and we ran them in 2022. "
"5416410","5417350"," They're awesome."
"5418410","5419570"," They're free."
"5419970","5421590"," They're literally free trades. "
"5422050","5426610"," Well, I guess they wouldn't be free if we stayed at if we traded 400 for the next year."
"5428030","5429450"," You might lose your money."
"5430170","5434910"," I guess nothing's without some kind of some kind of risk. "
"5435510","5437570"," But it's it's the least risky trade."
"5437810","5442650"," Probably you could put on this market if you're a fair full of a last leg down this year."
"5448290","5453430"," Biden says his jobs report shows people who were staying out of the labor markets are getting back"
"5453430","5453810"," in. "
"5461690","5463710"," I'm just going to bring up Biden live here."
"5464130","5466170"," This dream is sponsored by to the tick."
"5466690","5471430"," Get free daily points for Benachi and market profile levels by signing up. "
"5473230","5482710"," I'm asking you isn't that a direct result of the passage of This is y'all speaking"
"5482710","5487350"," the creation of the inflation reduction act which increases the number of audits."
"5487710","5491730"," We've established more than 400 those taxpayers more than $400,000."
"5492190","5498670"," I asked you about the number not historical levels the actual number of taxpayers making less than"
"5498670","5499610"," $400,000. "
"5499610","5510300"," I don't"
"5510300","5511400"," see him live right now."
"5521160","5526060"," Well in fact taxpayers with incomes less than $400,000 in several ways."
"5526600","5533780"," Activities other than audits such as collections and automated screening and document matching are"
"5533780","5538780"," not constrained by the secretary's director and under the 2022 reconciliation act the amounts they"
"5538780","5541500"," generate will be greater for taxpayers with all amounts of income CBO projects. "
"5541780","5544520"," My question to you is you don't have any reason to doubt what CBO says in this letter to you."
"5544640","5550140"," We want taxpayers to be able to pay and to pay the amounts that are due and presumably Biden's as"

"16470230","16479180"," ah that doesn't cut it because it has to be with conviction right at our knees same thing down here"
"16479180","16489080"," if you're a bull for next week and you want to buy this still"
"16489080","16496740"," is not the place probably you're probably going to get some volatility this week that will send it"

"16836670","16838110"," Well, the charted out later. "
"16850870","16852830"," Yeah, I don't know how they get through this right here."
"16853170","16854950"," Maybe there's some news that I don't see."
"16859240","16862960"," I don't see any, I don't see any like material news. "
"16863020","16863740"," Why would we?"
"16863940","16864300"," Why would?"
"16865300","16870820"," And other than grinding through here, you I guess you can see VIX."
"16871320","16873320"," Maybe you can see like VIX climbing."
"16874080","16876640"," I don't think price follows that spy it might. "
"16878680","16882480"," But I want you to realize out there that this is December right here."
"16882600","16886100"," This is like that a week or two of December buying activity."
"16887380","16889520"," So it's going to be a grind to get through this stuff. "
"16891960","16896060"," Remember on February 28 where they got down into here at the bell."
"16896380","16897180"," Maybe you see it then."
"16898720","16901020"," So you can't take a call here and take it above this. "
"16901300","16902920"," I want you to see this like above here."
"16903040","16904420"," You can't take a call."
"16904600","16905760"," But if they do sell it in the close. "
"16908780","16913380"," They did it on February 28 because you couldn't resist it."
"16915280","16919860"," So they do is they'll just kind of grind over here in the last like last minute or something."
"16920640","16922940"," They'll do anything that they can to get down here. "
"16924800","16930160"," And like no one's paying attention on a Friday and you'll see VIX rip up and hedge funds will get"
"16930160","16931300"," the lower price that they want."
"16931900","16936100"," And actually what you will also see is you'll see some weird action down here."
"16936720","16940960"," And what they'll do is they'll buy another 30 points lower. "
"16941100","16942460"," You'll see like a 30 point move down."
"16943680","16948880"," Seventy sometimes seven you'll see ghost prints down there where they're picking up the market way"
"16948880","16949600"," way way down there."
"16950380","16951620"," So they're always ahead of you. "
"16959550","16960790"," So does this happen?"
"16961190","16961910"," Sometimes it does."
"16964660","16965660"," And you'll see it."
"16965820","16967360"," It'll be a sneaky peak kind of a thing. "
"16973200","16978460"," Remember when they did that on February 28 when I put the numbers up and I'm like okay we're we"
"16978460","16979900"," still haven't hit these numbers."
"16980800","16981780"," We're at end of month."
"16982340","16985480"," We had like one minute left in the day and we stayed in we stayed in stream. "
"16986800","16991340"," And I think we dropped 30 or 40 handles in one minute to hit those numbers."
"16992720","16994680"," And then they bought ghost prints down below."
"16994960","16996280"," They bought a bunch of shit down there. "
"16997580","16998840"," They don't let you do that though."
"16999560","17000340"," It's not your market."
"17010510","17010950"," Thanks. "
"17010950","17012690"," Thank you for helping people out there on Twitch."
"17016480","17018120"," Yeah that's an easy way to support."
"17018380","17021540"," It's like a free way to support the channel. "
"17022260","17023260"," It costs you nothing."
"17024040","17025400"," It takes two minutes to do."
"17027120","17027760"," It's awesome. "
"17029120","17030400"," You can't do that on YouTube."
"17038890","17042670"," Yeah and you get free games and all kinds of stuff."
"17050330","17051850"," What are you guys doing this weekend?"
"17052210","17053810"," Has anybody have anything any fun this weekend?"
"17054170","17055530"," Anybody out there watching right now?"
"17055930","17057050"," Having fun this weekend?"
"17058210","17060350"," Anybody going skiing, hiking, snowboarding?"
"17061370","17062990"," I don't know surfing or anything like that. "
"17064130","17065250"," I got to stuffed up nose."
"17065590","17067630"," I'm talking about how I never get sick and I got to stuffed up nose."
"17067730","17068350"," I think it might be spring. "
"17071390","17072830"," Yeah you're watching the snowstorm."
"17073270","17074030"," Yeah we got that too."
"17076630","17077690"," Anybody going out anywhere?"
"17078010","17079210"," Anybody going to a concert or anything?"
"17080590","17087190"," I was looking at going to a regional and set up for the Big Burn. "
"17088070","17094030"," I haven't been to this one before and I was talking to a buddy last night."
"17094030","17097130"," I was like I was going to do this with my family."
"17097630","17102510"," The regional Burning Man events are a little bit calmer than the Big Burn. "
"17103950","17113010"," I like when the kids can play with other kids and they're artistic and they like music and games"
"17113010","17120310"," and stuff like that and I was looking at that the regional burn because it's not as it's not as"
"17120310","17120910"," crazy right?"
"17122170","17123170"," And adult oriented."
"17123570","17131410"," It's not nearly and there's like this regional burn is like hey we're going to do a family camp and"
"17131410","17132310"," I was like that sounds great."
"17132710","17137390"," I was like I'll get involved in that and I was like I'll totally get involved in that. "
"17137410","17138450"," How do I sign up?"
"17138550","17138990"," I've got kids."
"17140810","17146790"," It's like a family you make like a big camp for kids and adults watch all these kids together make"
"17146790","17155750"," sure they're not getting in trouble and that kind of stuff and it's more hands-on and stuff but I"
"17155750","17159270"," was like it's 200 bucks a person to go."
"17160730","17162290"," I'm like 800 bucks. "
"17162290","17167110"," I remember when the burn costs 200 bucks believe it or not."
"17169090","17171450"," The Big Burn when it costs 200 bucks a ticket."
"17173590","17175830"," I understand why it costs so much. "
"17176070","17177530"," It's not it's not easy."
"17177890","17186030"," You have to support artists and support creative people and of course support the burn and stuff"
"17186030","17186430"," like that."
"17190030","17190690"," This is expensive. "
"17192170","17193530"," I don't know what I'm making this year."
"17194410","17195850"," I was thinking about making a something."
"17196150","17198650"," I don't know what I don't know what to make yet this year but I was going to make something. "
"17203820","17204420"," Thanks Tony."
"17205500","17205960"," Appreciate it."
"17212850","17214510"," Yeah I was going to build something this year. "
"17214610","17215250"," I don't know what to build."
"17218970","17223690"," I'd like to build something like that you can get hurt on."
"17226990","17229370"," My experience at Burning Man is you have to get hurt. "
"17229810","17231370"," It's not Burning Man if you don't get hurt."
"17237730","17239850"," You have to like come back kind of banged up."
"17242290","17248010"," We used to do we used to be horrible people like we would do like we would put a sign"
"17248010","17248370"," out. "
"17249290","17254430"," We put a little like a little dirt jump for people to ride their bikes over the the dirt jump."
"17255210","17258510"," We'd make the soil kind of loose and sandy-ish."
"17258950","17259870"," We'd like break it up. "
"17260490","17264890"," We put on like a warning sign that you'll probably crash your bike to another little like little"
"17264890","17266050"," like one foot jump."
"17267810","17270050"," We'd see people just like eating shit."
"17276840","17278620"," Oh look at that right now. "
"17278780","17279720"," You guys see that?"
"17280020","17281820"," No I'm ex-Gaseline April futures."
"17281820","17283400"," Oh yeah."
"17283640","17284700"," What's going on over here?"
"17285380","17286740"," These are April futures. "
"17287000","17288780"," Settle that $2.77 a gallon."
"17289260","17291020"," And NIMEX natural gas April futures."
"17291100","17292560"," Pools get Nity over here. "
"17294180","17295220"," Pools get Nity."
"17297420","17298640"," NIMEX WTI crew."
"17298900","17300420"," Pools want to see that white line come up. "
"17300580","17303080"," They want to see a squeeze higher come back down that white line."
"17303240","17305480"," Get that blast north right now."
"17305700","17308080"," That's up 96 cents or one spot 27 percent. "
"17308880","17309740"," Pools get Nity."
"17310020","17311140"," They're getting Nity right now."
"17312100","17314180"," Pools like I want that squeeze cap. "
"17315240","17318520"," And I'm like yeah we could probably bleed down right into the bell 30 30 handles."
"17318540","17319580"," They're like no no no."
"17320440","17321760"," That's how bulls are man. "
"17321980","17323680"," They're just like they're like cocaine addicts."
"17324900","17325960"," They like the fuel."
"17327660","17329860"," Come on the show and lose all their money. "
"17331880","17333820"," They're watching this set up right now."
"17334000","17334760"," I know that they are."
"17334920","17336420"," They're like okay we got a box here. "
"17337500","17338820"," He drew us a crayon box."
"17340320","17344160"," We just need to buy ourselves some time and get priced over that white line over there."
"17344920","17347000"," I don't know why he keeps showing that five minute chart. "
"17348840","17350320"," Now I'm using that as a backup."
"17355670","17356350"," Diamond hands."
"17373900","17375800"," So you're saying I'm actually leaving tomorrow. "
"17375800","17377260"," I'll be back for about 12 days."
"17377260","17379940"," So I will see you guys very intermittently all next week."
"17381980","17383940"," Send send feet pics Joe. "
"17386180","17392400"," Send feet pics."
"17392720","17394840"," I'll send you up to call you or something before you leave."
"17396300","17398820"," Starting to pump and squeeze right now on the spy. "
"17400520","17401760"," Where's the VIXAT man."
"17401960","17403620"," They're gonna let that VIX close at a higher what."
"17405980","17406820"," Oh yeah dude. "
"17406960","17407540"," Look at that VIXAT."
"17407600","17409120"," He's a come on down doesn't it."
"17410560","17411900"," You got these VIX bulls. "
"17412180","17414540"," They're like we're going to 50 today and a Friday bro."
"17415560","17416580"," We're going to 50."
"17417380","17418440"," I'm gonna like know you're not. "
"17420400","17427180"," Oh that's looking pumpy isn't it."
"17428500","17430040"," It's looking really pumpy isn't it."
"17431100","17435820"," Remember you want price above the one minute. "
"17438790","17440090"," Oh yeah."
"17444250","17451390"," Oh Look at that."
"17452330","17452950"," Oh yeah. "
"17453710","17455410"," Oh it's right over there."
"17458190","17458990"," Oh yeah."
"17458990","17459090"," Yeah. "
"17467250","17468290"," Oh yeah get that."
"17468850","17469910"," Get that green out there."
"17470870","17471610"," You got green. "
"17472070","17472590"," They got green."
"17473350","17474130"," You like green."
"17474270","17479010"," U.S. Treasury Secretary Yellen says the financial regulator is moving today and expressed reliance"
"17479010","17480390"," in the banking system resilience. "
"17481710","17483770"," You mean when they try to reverse it on you."
"17483930","17484210"," Yeah yeah."
"17484610","17485310"," Okay what happens then. "
"17485730","17486630"," What has to hold the one."

"17511330","17512870"," Yeah get that price up there."
"17529080","17530640"," Get that one minute up there. "
"17536000","17541680"," U.S. Treasury Secretary Yellen says the financial regulators convene today and expressed reliance"
"17541680","17543480"," in the banking system's resilience."
"17544440","17545340"," Get that."
"17545740","17547600"," Get that price up there. "
"17548940","17550400"," Now what are you looking for here."
"17550600","17555720"," We're at a fast chart right."
"17560870","17562610"," We're going to get to one minute on the five minute chart. "
"17563530","17565490"," You know you get some resistance here right."
"17570900","17573500"," So you could see this bounce back right here right."
"17581520","17582340"," Makes sense. "
"17589800","17593360"," If we break below the yellow line on the five minute chart."
"17595560","17596700"," No bueno right."
"17597260","17601160"," No trend until we're above the red and white line. "
"17602040","17603600"," So it should be price white red."
"17604000","17605240"," That's what real trend is."
"17605940","17607240"," We don't see that yet do we. "
"17608760","17609660"," Oh yeah."
"17610800","17619240"," Oh now we need the green price to stay above the white line right now right."
"17620560","17621400"," Oh yeah. "
"17647790","17648670"," Thanks Winky."
"17650790","17652850"," Now let's go back and look at a one minute."
"17654590","17656730"," It's been kind of bullish down here isn't it. "
"17657730","17659570"," One two."
"17661510","17664370"," And maybe a pullback maybe right there."
"17665350","17668210"," Do you see the bull plane forming right there. "
"17668690","17669310"," Do you see it."
"17670150","17671610"," Just tell me if you see it at least."
"17680600","17681560"," Do you see it. "
"17682680","17684680"," Now where could be the danger here."
"17687970","17693450"," The danger here is that we haven't touched or broken through what was once support right."
"17694470","17698110"," So you had a quick move down maybe and then it starts to squeeze up. "
"17698610","17700070"," If it breaks over here."
"17701690","17705770"," And this reverses this white line this red line reverses you can be in trouble here right."
"17706530","17708710"," So where's the safe trade probably above here. "
"17711070","17714650"," But you have to be aware of all this maybe you're in a weekly trade here and then you just"
"17714650","17717790"," make sure that you're not price doesn't go below where your weekly trade is."
"17721790","17723690"," There's a five minute so you can see it better."
"17725470","17729370"," Now if you wanted to take this in some relative safety you see the white line right here. "
"17742960","17744580"," Where's the real safety in this trade."
"17744780","17746700"," We're trading slow charts here right."
"17747940","17749820"," We know where the real safety is right. "
"17755930","17760710"," It would only be if price came up here and went higher right."
"17760910","17762710"," This would be the actual safe trade right there."
"17763450","17764070"," Does that make sense. "
"17765390","17771910"," Successful defense on a five minute chart of the white above the red is the most safe or the safest"
"17771910","17772170"," trade."
"17773650","17777910"," Instead of getting caught in zero dates on a one minute chart and you're like I don't know where to"
"17777910","17778430"," sell or buy."
"17779130","17782550"," I don't know what you know or the stream is running late for me. "
"17783350","17786250"," Or I didn't put stops in or I'm getting cut up 20 30 times."
"17787710","17791850"," Or I'm never up or it's already rolling on me by the time I'm getting in."
"17792450","17796510"," Or I don't know where the price targets are or why they're there or how they're there. "
"17802130","17803690"," And that would be a red line right there."
"17815340","17817020"," It's kind of where you get cut up right."
"17817260","17818340"," You're getting torn up in here. "
"17818440","17819480"," You're getting torn up in here."
"17820380","17821720"," You're not buying and selling here."
"17821900","17822700"," Buying and selling here. "
"17823440","17828900"," And even here you know that even if the trade gets above the white line you know the next part"
"17828900","17830340"," of this trade is only to hear right."
"17830580","17831760"," That's the next part of that trade."
"17831980","17833240"," You're in and you're out on zero dates. "
"17833240","17837100"," On weeklies you probably stay in there or month out."
"17837260","17840820"," You probably stay in there unless it rolls under."
"17843140","17846680"," You cut your cut your cut your losses there. "
"17848060","17852060"," The best part of the trade is above on a successful defense of the one minute."
"17865340","17866460"," Hey Matt."
"17868040","17870660"," Thank you for supporting the stream just now. "

"19052590","19055410"," You're going to close the door because you don't want to hear Daddy talking over here."
"19060150","19060770"," Thanks, Ryan. "
"19061030","19061590"," Appreciate it, brother."
"19062750","19069350"," You know what Ryan, I think last time you gave that tip, I took the girls to go bowling, man."
"19069610","19070130"," I took them bowling. "
"19070390","19070710"," They had a blast."
"19071030","19073350"," I don't know what it is."
"19073350","19078730"," It was like arcade, bowling, like the expensive bowling and all that kind of crap, and they loved"
"19078730","19078930"," it. "
"19079990","19082190"," I should have had her say something about that."
"19082870","19084530"," Next time she's in here, I will though."
"19087330","19088270"," Okay, so here we go. "
"19088770","19090530"," So we've got our stops down here, right?"
"19090830","19092690"," You know they're going to try to stop you out down here."
"19092830","19093930"," Bears do not want this."
"19094110","19095810"," You see this red line above, right?"
"19096050","19097190"," You see this tag right here. "
"19097810","19101810"," They want to stop you from squeezing up higher into this bell, right?"
"19102030","19103650"," That's what they want to happen to you."
"19103650","19106210"," This is a slow five minute chart, right?"
"19106790","19108730"," You shouldn't be trading zero dates with this, should you?"
"19109070","19111630"," You should be trading like weeklies or monthlies on this."
"19112710","19117330"," It gives you more time to find out if this is the right trade or not. "
"19117790","19120430"," It gives you time to find out if you need to get out of the trade or not, right?"
"19121190","19123590"," We already talked about where the risk was in this trade."
"19124410","19129470"," To move higher, we talked about how do you confirm a trade higher here too, and it's right here,"
"19129610","19129750"," right?"
"19130070","19133090"," Right above that red line is where the trade becomes valid."
"19133810","19138290"," So the moment that you're above this red line right here, and you have the finger on the buy"
"19138290","19141110"," trigger, that's the zero date trade right there. "
"19149660","19151500"," Yeah, that's what I do."
"19152320","19152940"," Oh, no, man."
"19153120","19153580"," Five bucks. "
"19154540","19155860"," Johnny five, baby."
"19156300","19159100"," You know what I'll do is how about this?"
"19159880","19160860"," I'm supposed to go skiing tomorrow."
"19161040","19161360"," What about this?"
"19162420","19164520"," I'll take them bowling tonight and take pictures. "
"19167040","19168640"," I'll take them bowling tonight."
"19168640","19169860"," I'll take the girls out."
"19170060","19171640"," I just had a beer that I stopped drinking then. "
"19171860","19172940"," I'm going to take them bowling."
"19174500","19176300"," Can't drink and go bowling with the kids."
"19176520","19177960"," I'll probably look bad. "
"19179660","19180980"," Maybe the wife will drive."
"19181240","19182820"," I can ask her if she'll drive or something."
"19183740","19184780"," I'll take them bowling tonight. "
"19187330","19188270"," We'll take some pictures."
"19188510","19190350"," I mean, I'll do is I'll do a hold on a second."
"19191630","19193430"," Then make sure I get everybody right here. "
"19195650","19197070"," We'll do Stacy too."
"19199390","19200770"," I'm going to write your names down."
"19201010","19202870"," We're going to do a group picture or something. "
"19206540","19210420"," We'll do a group picture for tonight for anyone that tipped today."
"19210640","19211700"," I'll take them out bowling."
"19216080","19217480"," They like the bowling, I guess. "
"19217680","19218380"," It's snowing tonight."
"19219920","19220540"," It'll be fun."
"19221440","19224300"," Okay, so right down here, I'm going to delete this right now. "
"19224600","19224900"," Hold on."
"19225040","19226220"," Close this so you can see better."
"19227140","19228980"," I'm going to move this over right now for you. "
"19228980","19233260"," And you see how they're trying to stop you out right here in your five minute?"
"19233800","19235620"," You have to decide where your stops are."
"19235760","19236100"," Are they here?"
"19236400","19236880"," Are they here?"
"19237120","19237520"," Are they here?"
"19237660","19239020"," Are they going to try to pin it into the clothes?"
"19239860","19241800"," We're going to look at something more important here."
"19242020","19243280"," Let's say you're in a monthly or a weekly. "
"19244240","19246620"," And we've got a five day chart here, right?"
"19250220","19251680"," We got a five day chart here."
"19253060","19254720"," I'm going to move these over real quick."
"19255420","19256180"," Hold on. "
"19257540","19258480"," I was fucking deleted."
"19259900","19265380"," So you're not bullish even for a for a period of time until you get above this white line."
"19265420","19266720"," Do you see this white line right here?"
"19266820","19267680"," There's a five minute chart. "
"19268520","19269540"," So you've got a bear."
"19269680","19273840"," This is a bear bear bear airplane bear aeroplane forming currently."
"19274100","19275760"," It's not guaranteed, but it's forming. "
"19276900","19279880"," So when you have when you have this red line right here, right?"
"19280820","19283200"," You still want price to get above."
"19285360","19286620"," See this white line right here?"
"19286680","19287920"," You want price to get above this."
"19288980","19290980"," Sorry, the white line to get above the red line. "
"19291260","19296680"," And then you want price to get above before you can confirm the trade higher."
"19297060","19298760"," Now, I want to tell you a secret here."
"19299600","19301440"," This doesn't always work when it works a lot. "
"19305600","19307560"," If on a five minute chart."
"19309000","19310100"," You back test this in yourself."
"19310400","19311940"," Don't don't don't don't follow this. "
"19312820","19314940"," The back test is on your own."
"19317880","19321240"," If price on a five minute chart is above the white."
"19322740","19323540"," Oh, hold on. "
"19325200","19329820"," If price into the close is above the price is above."
"19332060","19333660"," You want to see some examples of this?"
"19333760","19334160"," I'll show you."
"19336140","19337100"," I can do that. "
"19337360","19338580"," If price is above the."
"19342020","19344300"," The white in red on a close."
"19345820","19351700"," We typically gap up that Monday for that next day typically like 70% of the time. "
"19353540","19354120"," That's true."
"19354360","19355780"," I'll show it to you right now if you want to see it."
"19356060","19358060"," So we'll gap up if price gets above. "
"19359420","19361120"," Or we'll be green on the next day."
"19362360","19366580"," If price gets above the white in the red in a five minute chart into that bell, we're typically"
"19366580","19367920"," green the next the next day."
"19368580","19370200"," So you're like, how do you how do you do overnight?"
"19370460","19371420"," That's that's how you do them. "
"19374310","19375850"," You want to see some examples of it?"
"19376410","19384560"," Oh, there's one right there."
"19385320","19386300"," Didn't even take long."
"19390120","19392380"," The white line right there, price above the white line. "
"19392420","19394700"," The red line actually crossed that 1624."
"19395920","19397980"," We went up right there next day."
"19400590","19401790"," We want to see another one. "
"19402830","19404690"," Price above the white and red line of the close."
"19405190","19405890"," Another one right there."
"19409850","19412510"," Price above right here above the next day. "
"19417010","19419490"," Price above white and red line of that bell."
"19419750","19420610"," Gapped up next day."
"19421210","19423390"," Price above the white and red line of the five minute chart. "
"19424450","19424810"," Right."
"19425110","19425710"," Did not work."
"19426170","19427790"," So you got one example, but not working. "
"19430390","19432930"," Price below white and red worked."
"19433610","19439010"," But for me, like I'm like, hey, if I was going to hold overnight, what am I looking for typically"
"19439010","19442550"," price above the white and red line into a close."
"19443350","19444010"," White house. "
"19444010","19444970"," It's good work here."
"19444970","19447210"," Did it in a bigger down center in banking system."
"19451010","19451750"," Price below. "
"19452150","19452590"," Gapped up."
"19453410","19455150"," Price above didn't gap up."
"19455410","19456190"," This is a downtrend. "
"19456370","19456510"," It's a beer."
"19456830","19458010"," Maybe it's a white house."
"19458170","19458890"," It's a better one. "
"19459410","19460150"," It was necessary."
"19460510","19462470"," We're an uptrend on an hourly chart."
"19462670","19462810"," It works. "
"19463810","19466670"," So I'm saying it works in a five minute, but it has to work in an hourly chart, too."
"19466990","19468210"," An actual trend in the market."
"19469470","19470550"," Maybe I'll maybe I'll let me. "
"19470550","19471210"," Like me."
"19471590","19473070"," Just like I said, ticks."
"19473190","19476830"," Rike allows you to actually hear water flowing futures for X and stock. "
"19476990","19479510"," You're going to get a free trial at ticks."
"19479570","19479810"," Right."
"19479970","19480270"," Com. "
"19484190","19485190"," Into this close."
"19486510","19489970"," If the white line is above the above the red line, I'm going to expect it to go up to"
"19489970","19494330"," that 393 on Monday and probably sell off before the open."
"19500120","19502740"," That would be very wary of all these sellers up here. "
"19503420","19505600"," You want this to happen before close today."
"19506380","19513540"," Well, you don't want to happen in this close is like, like we close above the white and red line"
"19513540","19518380"," and then we squeeze up overnight and they sell it on Monday morning at six a.m. down here."
"19519340","19520420"," You don't want to see that. "
"19521440","19523900"," You want this to happen right now in this market."
"19527600","19529180"," Sometimes you'll hear me say that right in stream."
"19529320","19531020"," I'll be like, Oh, I want this to happen right now. "
"19531900","19534440"," I want the risk overnight of having to do this."
"19534440","19540340"," It's a little more capital than it used to and has to build more resilience to withstand shocks and"
"19540340","19540680"," watch them."
"19540680","19542680"," Trying to sell it down right now in the five minute. "
"19544480","19546720"," They don't want their squeeze into the close."
"19547460","19549900"," And then these stops they're trying to take out down here."
"19550000","19551900"," They're trying to whisk down these stops right now. "
"19552680","19555940"," Trying to stop you out of the trade hire into the close."
"19561070","19562630"," Put that back for it's right there."
"19568660","19570480"," I think it was right here or something right here. "
"19571780","19574020"," I don't know why it's all wonky right now."
"19574040","19574420"," There it is."
"19577800","19579060"," Just like down here. "
"19579180","19579780"," I don't know what happened."
"19580360","19581920"," Something on the chart didn't work."
"19582840","19584860"," That was interpreted, interpreted in the close. "
"19596720","19598260"," Ah, thanks for the good dad stuff."
"19601410","19602370"," Squeeze and I are now."

"19621100","19622340"," It was up into this up here."

"19897040","19901080"," So I guess that's going to be like cheese pizza with no sauce on it or something."
"19901800","19902480"," It's going to be gross."
"19904540","19909420"," It does look like diamond hands, doesn't it?"
"19909520","19910360"," It looks like diamond hands. "
"19910700","19911100"," It looks great."
"19914810","19917270"," Yeah, it's pulsating right now, isn't it, Tony?"
"19917390","19917850"," Do you feel it?"
"19920030","19922610"," She put it on the one minute chart and just take a look at it, Tony."
"19923290","19924250"," Her old time's sake. "
"19925710","19927410"," You want to see it on old time's sake?"
"19928630","19929590"," Oh, yeah."
"19931530","19933370"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"19934850","19935370"," Ooh. "
"19935690","19938490"," Gotta get past all this bullshit right here, don't we?"
"19940530","19941050"," Ooh."
"19941630","19942150"," Ooh."
"19943490","19944010"," Ooh. "
"19945810","19946930"," Do we do it?"
"19947050","19947430"," I don't know."
"19947650","19948550"," Sometimes we don't, man."
"19948670","19950530"," A Friday they're like, you can't do that on Friday. "
"19950730","19951170"," It's not allowed."
"19953190","19953710"," Unclench."
"19954790","19955870"," Unclench the VIX. "
"19957050","19957950"," Close your puts."
"19965580","19966900"," We need a rocket, right?"
"19967420","19969280"," We need a rocket into the bell, don't we?"
"19969680","19970840"," I need a rocket."
"19971860","19975360"," I need a rocket chip into the end of the shit week. "
"19978580","19980680"," Yellen is going to save the markets over the weekend."
"19985840","19991000"," Are they going to bloodbath here like one last beat by five?"
"19991560","19992360"," Bears we're here."
"19992560","19993800"," Are we going to get bear shit in the walls?"
"19995400","19997120"," Is that what they're going to do, bear shit?"
"19998420","20001220"," Bears come in here and just shit all over the place and run out. "
"20002140","20008500"," One last, one last, see ya."
"20014690","20017790"," Oh, yeah."
"20018070","20018750"," Here we go, man. "
"20018930","20020030"," We got more bearishness."
"20021130","20025350"," Joe lacks the man, says no reason for bears to close puts here, to be honest."
"20026050","20032230"," Close below 200 SMA, weekly bearish MACD, crossing incoming, et cetera, et cetera. "
"20032230","20033570"," More contagion."
"20034350","20035370"," I agree with that."
"20036450","20037430"," I just don't know that you're going to. "
"20037690","20041970"," I don't think you need, I think he's right though, in some extent."
"20042290","20043650"," You need to have contagion."
"20044050","20045530"," If you don't get the contagion. "
"20047770","20053110"," If you don't get the contagion, here we move this over, on the five minute here, if you don't get,"
"20053270","20055170"," so you need some bad news over the weekend."
"20055910","20064150"," If you don't get bad news here, if you don't get bad news, like you need that, because this is"
"20064150","20065910"," December support, right?"
"20066530","20070170"," So you need some reason to grind through this over the weekend."
"20071750","20075250"," You need some kind of bad news, like you need more like a bank contagion. "
"20075250","20078830"," If you don't get that bank contagion, it's going to rip into Monday."
"20080330","20081830"," You need that for sure."
"20082810","20084990"," You need some kind of bad news into Sunday. "
"20085730","20095660"," So in the five minute, we're losing the five minute right now, trying to sell you out on"
"20095660","20096900"," these stops right here."
"20097000","20103380"," Look at them, trying to take out the five minute stops right here, into the close, trying to bear"
"20103380","20106280"," poop all over the walls, into this close, what they're trying to do."
"20106280","20108740"," Let's look at this, the one minute and see what it looks like. "
"20110420","20112220"," That looks like a bear plane, doesn't it?"
"20112880","20114940"," See how the bear plane is setting up right now?"
"20115160","20120100"," You see the white in the yellow line, this is looking ugly, right?"
"20120260","20124800"," You see the stops right here, and you're being stopped out right now on the one minute."
"20126640","20128560"," Now, there's another trade here."
"20128900","20135080"," If you were long, let's say right here you're long, and you're losing money, you pick up the short"
"20135080","20141140"," side of this trade, and if you get sent down here, you make some money. "
"20141320","20143220"," You leave the calls on if there's zero dates."
"20144960","20152380"," Let's say they're almost worthless, you leave the calls on and you buy some put zero dates, not"
"20152380","20153100"," financial advice."
"20155660","20162600"," And then you'd hold them both at this point to cover the burn on the call side, to un-f"
"20162600","20163620"," yourself from that trade. "
"20168760","20172940"," When you let the calls get torched, if they come back and rip face into the close, you're good to"
"20172940","20173140"," go."
"20179880","20184720"," We need a North Korean rocket at 325 PM, 321 right now."
"20185920","20189740"," Bears have nine minutes left to send this down to the depths of hell. "
"20192250","20196530"," Nine minutes left for bears, they've got 321, they've got nine minutes left to throw this down."
"20220390","20221490"," That's the one minute chart."
"20221650","20222690"," Let's see the five minute chart. "
"20224790","20227070"," Trying to kick you out of your stops right here, right?"
"20231230","20233330"," We remember that the safe trade is above."
"20233610","20237790"," When price is above the white and red line on the five minute, not the one minute."
"20242300","20244020"," Let's look at this one minute again though. "
"20259420","20265820"," Oh, man, this big man starting to get price starting to trade above the VIX on the one and five"
"20265820","20266120"," minute."
"20266300","20272880"," Point house economic advisor, from a root tree says wage growth continues to outpace inflation."
"20275020","20277380"," Bremmer trying to throw some poop on the party. "
"20289710","20292550"," Yeah, you want to see that guy cramp into the belt."
"20293350","20294410"," Point to the nose."
"20294410","20295270"," Close all those levels. "
"20295950","20297890"," And then rip face 30 points north."
"20298090","20298730"," Dot com."
"20306040","20314140"," Oh, uh, SL ID a one, one, three, three, one, four dash, seven, seven, five, nine dash, three,"
"20314180","20314800"," seven, eight, zero. "
"20314960","20315780"," Thanks for tip Jesus."
"20315780","20316100"," What?"
"20316220","20316980"," That's a huge tip."
"20319560","20322060"," Ace can say go super chat. "
"20322200","20323500"," I've always been watching you for about a month."
"20323660","20324280"," There's a lot of value."
"20324360","20324960"," Thanks for the games. "
"20325160","20325500"," Right on."
"20326540","20328100"," Johnny Franco subscribed."
"20331200","20334640"," SL ID slide a slide a."
"20337120","20338320"," I'm trying to read this. "
"20338420","20339020"," See if it says anything."
"20339400","20341440"," Maybe you spelled something in it's a cool name, by the way."
"20341520","20341980"," I wonder what it means. "
"20343280","20344660"," Thanks for supporting the channel, man."
"20345540","20346980"," I'll put you on that sign tonight."
"20347040","20348240"," I'm going to put all of you on the sign tonight. "
"20348780","20350100"," We'll make us all the girls make a sign."
"20350500","20351340"," They have really good artwork."
"20358360","20360280"," This is the latest one that gave me right there. "
"20360380","20361040"," They just gave me that."
"20361580","20363380"," Maybe we can send artwork out or something."
"20363500","20364800"," I think a mill artwork out or something. "
"20366060","20367080"," They do really nice art."
"20368100","20368640"," They're artists."
"20373520","20374200"," Oh, man. "
"20374360","20375620"," So you know what I'd be right here, right?"
"20391700","20392920"," Yeah, right now."
"20414150","20415290"," I'm long here, man."
"20419090","20420310"," I'm looking for that. "
"20420530","20421890"," I'm looking for that blast up."
"20427530","20430910"," I want that VIX to crater right now and get that."
"20434330","20435870"," Get that ripfacer. "
"20437990","20438990"," Unclench bears."
"20440210","20441570"," Closer puts bears."
"20453880","20454520"," Never. "
"20457380","20458960"," That's the least to say in the Army, never."
"20466900","20468180"," We were talking about that."
"20468940","20470620"," I was talking with a friend yesterday about that. "
"20476210","20477330"," He's like, why didn't you call it?"
"20477390","20477850"," Why didn't you call it?"
"20477910","20478310"," Why didn't you call it?"
"20478310","20478830"," Why weren't you leave?"
"20479030","20479730"," It wasn't relieved."
"20481190","20484650"," If every soldier called their boss and said, when am I getting relieved?"
"20485170","20486230"," The military wouldn't do it."
"20486330","20487390"," You're supposed to be doing it in the military. "
"20493590","20494270"," Everybody bitched."
"20495250","20496310"," Nothing we get done."
"20499370","20500550"," I didn't say it like that. "
"20500630","20503030"," I said a bunch of other stuff, but can't talk about that stuff."
"20504050","20505250"," Now, train 386."
"20506110","20507690"," Bull's fighting for their life. "
"20508550","20512030"," They already broke through S1 at 240."
"20512910","20516510"," Bull's trying their best right now to pull out one last win."
"20517890","20518930"," One win in the week. "
"20519610","20520470"," Can they get it?"
"20521410","20524450"," Price now trading over a minor cluster."
"20525790","20529090"," But price is above the one in five minute right out of one minute trigger."
"20530850","20532990"," Let's see the five minute and see what's going on. "
"20533830","20534830"," Can they do it?"
"20535710","20537890"," Can the bull squeeze higher here?"
"20539110","20539550"," How about this?"
"20539790","20540770"," How about instead of this PT?"
"20542850","20544410"," Can bulls get the 388-65?"
"20545070","20545710"," Can they get there?"
"20547510","20548970"," Can the bulls mean us halfway?"
"20552890","20554910"," Can they get up here at 388-65?"
"20555250","20555530"," Where's that?"
"20555750","20556190"," Like right here."
"20556330","20557010"," Can they give us something?"
"20558670","20562090"," 327, three minutes left for the bears to take over."
"20562310","20565230"," They got three minutes to bloodbath this right now. "
"20567920","20569180"," Bears have three minutes."
"20570040","20571200"," Then we hit the half hour mark."
"20572240","20573060"," Or the hour mark, right?"
"20575060","20578580"," If bears can't get a new low right now off of this one minute. "
"20580000","20582280"," They got three minutes right here to get it."
"20582340","20585380"," If they can't and they give it up, you know where we go."
"20593990","20601980"," Send it by the underlying. "
"20614510","20616230"," Two minutes left right now."
"20617250","20618730"," Very dangerous right now."
"20631020","20631760"," Unclench it. "
"20636880","20638520"," Unclench it on a Friday, baby."
"20639840","20640620"," Unclench it."
"20645410","20648530"," If I wanted your opinion, I would give it to you. "
"20650010","20651570"," When the dip keeps dipping."
"20657800","20660900"," There's bulls haven't won anything right now."
"20661600","20662420"," They've won nothing. "
"20663320","20665880"," Like the overall picture right now is not good for the bulls."
"20666440","20670500"," According to Gene Pierre, Biden is to me Australia and UK leaders on Monday."
"20670500","20677960"," You need someone to step up for the bulls because the market is telling you that 393 I believe,"
"20678080","20681740"," 397, 396, 393 and change is top. "
"20682540","20684120"," We ain't going to be up there for a little while."
"20684200","20684960"," That's what they're saying at least."
"20687860","20689420"," But the way is down. "
"20689700","20690360"," That's what they're telling you."
"20690440","20691000"," The way is down."
"20692000","20693560"," We're going to grind through December. "
"20693980","20695500"," We're going to start heading down to October."
"20696980","20699160"," You would need to get above 400."
"20700280","20702200"," For bulls to even begin to discuss. "
"20705000","20706380"," Being in charge of anything."
"20708660","20711580"," There's nothing bullish here unless you hold 400."
"20712680","20713940"," It's a little bit different. "
"20714500","20715080"," It's a little bit different."
"20715080","20715240"," It's a little bit different."
"20715660","20718500"," Right now. "
"20722140","20722720"," Right now."
"20722980","20725480"," Right now."
"20725480","20726220"," Right now. "
"20726320","20727600"," They really need to hold."
"20728640","20733180"," Currently they have to hold 39974 in the into next week."
"20734760","20736480"," It'll be a little bit lower on Monday. "
"20736600","20739460"," They'll have to hold 39754 on Monday."
"20741020","20741580"," 39754."
"20742040","20743320"," Fools take that and hold it. "
"20744200","20747580"," They'll have a conversation about trend change."
"20748360","20749420"," Unless they get that."
"20750500","20751080"," They won't. "
"20751740","20752800"," It's very close."
"20752800","20753140"," Right?"
"20753200","20754600"," It's like the setup a couple days ago."
"20754840","20754940"," Right?"
"20756120","20758060"," A five minute chart right here. "
"20759080","20760280"," 397 is where it is."
"20762340","20763580"," Right down here."
"20763720","20763960"," It's moved. "
"20764120","20765240"," This is where the swellers are now."
"20765360","20766240"," It's actually moved down."
"20768060","20769860"," Now it's tightening up down here. "
"20773960","20775380"," 39282 for trend."
"20777240","20778100"," Right here."
"20780360","20784980"," All of this cell pressure in the market is coming down. "
"20784980","20786360"," It's coming down on top of bulls right now."
"20790120","20794540"," And I think all bulls are looking for is a snapback to get into some ratio spreads."
"20798370","20799410"," Or to reload. "
"20802570","20804050"," On what do you call it?"
"20804230","20806790"," Calls on test out calls."
"20809010","20812970"," We know that industrials are loaded with bulls."
"20813810","20815790"," Loaded industrials are just all bulls. "
"20816970","20818230"," They're hiding out in there."
"20825680","20828040"," It's the big one for liquidation."
"20828040","20830480"," You'd need to liquidate industrials. "
"20841900","20842960"," There should be."
"20843460","20844640"," Sometimes they don't."
"20847980","20850220"," If someone was saying something earlier about. "
"20853580","20854720"," Someone was saying earlier."
"20855120","20855520"," What do they say?"
"20856880","20857940"," Like a contagion."
"20860220","20863220"," Like you don't want to see the no unclenching. "
"20863380","20864260"," You want to see them unclench."
"20864820","20866720"," If you don't see them unclench, it's not good."
"20867820","20871400"," It means that they're going to hold short because they're afraid of what's going to happen over the"
"20871400","20871640"," weekend. "
"20873080","20874380"," Most of the time they do."
"20874500","20876380"," They don't want the risk over a Saturday Sunday."
"20876880","20877880"," But if they know something. "
"20878740","20881360"," If they know something, they'll hold short over the weekend."
"20895920","20899360"," Yeah, if they don't then clench over the weekend, you'd be worried that something's going to come"
"20899360","20900280"," out over Sunday."
"20905030","20906290"," Nice on BBY. "
"20906770","20907210"," Congrats."
"20913960","20914740"," Hey, Thomas."
"20914920","20915500"," No worries, bro. "
"20917980","20919860"," Oh, man, dude, Thomas, seriously?"
"20926450","20927290"," Thanks, Thomas."
"20934340","20935920"," Yeah, I like I like bears, man."
"20936160","20937200"," I'm not against bears at all. "
"20937560","20938100"," I like bears."
"20938560","20940360"," I like bears in bulls."
"20940980","20942520"," I know you're all retail traders trying to make money. "
"20946440","20947580"," Put the tip in."
"20954240","20956540"," You got more than the tip this week, though."
"20957280","20961680"," Do you guys remember when I was like, yeah, if you put the tip down in the weekly and monthly,"
"20961680","20962480"," it's not enough. "
"20962600","20963900"," You have to blast right through it."
"20965060","20968280"," The moment you blast it through, I was like, oh, we're fucked."
"20968800","20971060"," I'm like, bulls don't have any idea how fucked we are. "
"20974220","20975980"," I was like, they have no idea."
"20975980","20977040"," They don't want to believe it."
"20979980","20984100"," The moment you broke through the, when you finally broke through the weekly and monthly and you did"
"20984100","20984780"," it with some force. "
"20986340","20987620"," Game over, man."
"20988060","20989620"," Just like aliens game over."
"20990280","20994660"," It even, even whatever, whatever happened, we got to snap back into Monday. "
"20996180","20998520"," It's pretty much in my view so far."
"20998520","21001440"," Like anything like this means nothing to a bear right here."
"21005190","21006470"," Bears broke through with force. "
"21006910","21007910"," They're like, we're going down."
"21008850","21009890"," We're in a new level."
"21011030","21013390"," Welcome to the, welcome to the below decks. "
"21015890","21018230"," You thought you were singing poolside on the cruise ship?"
"21018530","21020050"," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"21020610","21021930"," They lied to you."
"21022210","21023250"," You're down here with us. "
"21023990","21024590"," Here's a shovel."
"21024930","21025410"," Here's some coal."
"21026330","21028310"," Start making that train run down below. "
"21036220","21037680"," Nice on BBY."
"21041200","21042880"," Yeah, if, if."
"21044700","21046340"," There's a couple actions here. "
"21048780","21053660"," So in cash market without a major event, this is going to take time to grind through."
"21053860","21055960"," The only chance bears have to get through this."
"21056400","21058980"," Is in some unknown news, some bullshit. "
"21059120","21059680"," Not putting it."
"21059780","21060340"," Sometimes it's bullshit."
"21061580","21064720"," Or they break through this in a low volatility moment. "
"21064860","21066220"," There's another way for them to break through too."
"21066360","21068340"," And that is the last few minutes of Friday."
"21069520","21073880"," If you've got no participants in the market, they can send it straight down here. "
"21074600","21078280"," Close their shorts and then you come up on Monday."
"21078580","21081700"," Wouldn't hold down here on Monday unless you had more bad news or something."
"21084440","21085840"," So they get that as well. "
"21085840","21098610"," No, it"
"21098610","21098950"," doesn't."
"21099010","21101450"," Most, they'll try to wrap it up."
"21101610","21102690"," Usually they don't. "
"21103450","21106010"," If you get some good news every weekend, you can get destroyed."
"21106850","21107710"," Any kind of good news."
"21108410","21110310"," Now, if they know something that we don't know. "
"21110550","21111210"," There's a retail trailer."
"21111410","21115310"," Hey, we know some or I'm going to spend 50 million and make, make something known."
"21115570","21117210"," Then yeah, I'd hold short over the weekend too. "
"21119030","21121230"," You don't really think this market is real, do you?"
"21122970","21124510"," You know that all of this is planned."
"21124510","21125790"," I hope you do."
"21136590","21137510"," They know everything. "
"21138790","21140530"," Actually, you know when they don't know something."
"21141250","21145630"," So when we have an unknown event happen and you have an immediate reaction, they still send it back"
"21145630","21147810"," so they can get in on that trade every time."
"21149430","21150650"," Every single time. "
"21154020","21154980"," No, not every single."
"21155480","21159380"," Sometimes they get run over, but most times if they can, they'll bring it back."
"21159380","21163860"," I was promising outside deck view. "
"21164480","21168200"," Oh, yeah."
"21168340","21169380"," We want to get some beer music."
"21169560","21169800"," Hold on. "
"21170100","21172040"," Let's close the weekend out with some beer music."
"21172900","21174220"," I agree with that statement."
"21175000","21176080"," Bears did it this week. "
"21176300","21178600"," So we have to give some praise here to the Bears."
"21179320","21181620"," Give me a second here and I'll get some beer music into this close."
"21183160","21184120"," Congrats to the Bears. "
"21189180","21190020"," Hold on here."
"21190260","21192040"," Let me get some beer jams going."
"21192040","21193560"," Beer jams, dude. "
"21194580","21195440"," Beer jams."
"21202560","21204280"," You guys want your favorite song?"
"21205080","21208700"," Or do you want some like, you want some rock and roll or something?"
"21208860","21209600"," You want some power metal?"
"21216750","21218410"," Or do you want your favorite song?"
"21218550","21219450"," I hate your favorite song here."
"21221450","21222910"," We'll pop that track in. "
"21229460","21232120"," Do the Bears uncluncher not?"
"21233720","21236040"," The Bears came to play this week."
"21239640","21241560"," Bulls are like, you're not taking us down there."
"21241680","21242880"," We're staying on this level, bro. "
"21245810","21247570"," And Bears are like, fuck no."
"21250800","21252280"," Bears are like, we're coming down."
"21254280","21256420"," You thought you were going to pull that December shit?"
"21257300","21258640"," We ain't pulling that December shit. "
"21259640","21261000"," We're taking December back."
"21262180","21264040"," We're going back to October."
"21264040","21268120"," We're going to have fun with the Bulls. "
"21278910","21279710"," Oh, yeah."
"21280190","21283170"," He used Wonderland, said I had a very good meeting with Biden."
"21289310","21289830"," So..."
"21291190","21291930"," Oh, there. "
"21297740","21300000"," This stream is sponsored by Ticksright."
"21300060","21304600"," Spied out to $3,550 trying to shake out every last bull on this market into the close."
"21306280","21307260"," Letting Bulls know. "
"21307260","21308080"," He's trying to dot com."
"21311440","21314760"," He's wondering if this will be well for the inflation reduction act because it is a massive"
"21314760","21316160"," investment in the green for a transition."
"21316960","21320280"," And it's called Danger Snow by Dan Hennig. "
"21320400","21325600"," They want blood into the last part."
"21325780","21326980"," I might want to buy this bell too."
"21328540","21333030"," It's called Danger Snow by Dan Hennig. "
"21333650","21335190"," Dan the Bear Hennig."
"21340640","21341420"," Oh, yeah."
"21341540","21342640"," It's like, whoo!"
"21345320","21348260"," Some trick-roll materials that have been sourced. "
"21348600","21349960"," Bulls need a prayer, baby."
"21350320","21351920"," Access to the American markets."
"21352980","21354600"," Hold on a second here. "
"21356240","21357820"," Let's see if I can find something out there."
"21359320","21360540"," No, no, no."
"21360700","21361240"," That's not fair. "
"21362880","21363980"," I need a bear."
"21369780","21371060"," No, that's not fair."
"21372340","21373600"," Hold on, hold on, hold on. "
"21382050","21382410"," No."
"21386230","21387130"," Oh, here we go."
"21391140","21394860"," Trying to get something here that I haven't heard before, but I'm not doing a good job at this. "
"21399650","21401770"," All right, let's have a..."
"21401770","21403990"," He's one of the names as we agreed on dialogue."
"21404270","21407350"," He's trying to incentives to give to the clean attack industry."
"21410190","21412790"," Let's give a shout-out to all the Bears out there for this week. "
"21412930","21417250"," I'm going to say we're coming into the close right now, 3.41. I'm going to give you guys..."
"21417250","21419270"," I gave you guys earlier the five-day outlook."
"21419630","21424390"," We're going to do a stock show on Sunday at 12 o'clock Eastern Standard Time."
"21425170","21428970"," That's 10 a.m. for all of you up, 10 or 9 a.m. on the West Coast or Hawaii. "
"21430030","21430130"," Sunday."
"21431190","21433470"," Be there for Sunday or at least watch recorded video."
"21434170","21436610"," We'll do stock picks, market overview, that kind of stuff. "
"21437250","21442530"," On the five-day right here, if you didn't catch it earlier, I'm going to show you the five-day"
"21442530","21442830"," here."
"21443430","21445250"," Take a snap of this for next week."
"21445450","21446530"," This is your trading zone. "
"21449190","21451450"," This is all of December down in here."
"21452030","21453570"," This is where major support is."
"21454210","21455910"," Bears need to get underneath it with news. "
"21456330","21458350"," They need something big to get under it."
"21458410","21460430"," If they can't, we're going to trade up and tee off."
"21461210","21463630"," This is where the major sellers are above in this market. "
"21463630","21470910"," If bulls can't get above 397 by Monday, this isn't good enough to get up to 393."
"21470950","21472010"," It doesn't work like that."
"21472850","21477590"," Otherwise, my prediction for next week or what I'm thinking about for next week is that we have a"
"21477590","21480610"," capitulation liquidation moment in the markets. "
"21480930","21484750"," That is not a market crash."
"21485110","21490510"," That is just every sector that hasn't let out their dresses should happen into Monday."
"21491250","21494190"," We have two sectors, I think, still long. "
"21495250","21499030"," Believe it or not, we got tech, industrials."
"21500250","21501430"," I think that's it."
"21501570","21503030"," I think we're close to zero. "
"21503510","21506570"," I want to warn you if you're a bear, even when we crash."
"21507450","21508250"," I'm going to mute this."
"21508370","21509770"," I want to be very clear with you if you're a bear. "
"21512370","21515370"," Even when we crash, we get very oversold."
"21515570","21518090"," You'll see Dan Niles come out and say, we bought the dip."
"21518090","21521030"," It's because there's no one left to sell out to. "
"21521630","21526850"," When you start reading zeros on the sectors, it means that they're the ones that hold everything in"
"21526850","21527230"," the sectors."
"21527990","21528590"," Does that make sense?"
"21529370","21533710"," As we get closer and closer to a capitulation move, they will rip it higher again."
"21534570","21539670"," If we do start to crash at any point, if this is the last leg, it will get violent, but"
"21539670","21544190"," when it gets violent, there will be things like this last week. "
"21544690","21547270"," You'll have a capitulation move and then a face-ripper north."
"21548030","21550970"," That could last a day, 70 points, 100 points."
"21551570","21552850"," That's what you reset yourself. "
"21553670","21555550"," If you're a bull and you're like, I missed it all."
"21556450","21558550"," We're going to talk about this on Sunday."
"21559330","21564550"," That is going to be putback spreads, ratio spreads, so you can take a free trade. "
"21564750","21567370"," If you're a bear, matter of fact, forget the bulls."
"21567590","21573950"," If you're a bear, and you don't know what a ratio spread is, they're one of the easiest ways to"
"21573950","21574250"," short."
"21574550","21576850"," If the market goes up, you get paid for your trade. "
"21577330","21581390"," If the market goes down big time, you get paid big time."
"21581950","21584070"," It's almost a free trade in some ways."
"21584770","21586510"," If you're a bear, maybe you show up. "
"21586950","21592470"," If you're a bear that missed all of this, show up on Sunday because this will help you to take"
"21592470","21597570"," a bear trade and either get paid or not lose any money."
"21598390","21600230"," You know, you get squeezed out of trades."
"21601050","21606710"," Ratio spreads can help with you not getting totally trashed in those trades. "
"21608710","21609830"," Ratio spreads."
"21610210","21611630"," Over the weekend, look them up."
"21612390","21613790"," Ratio spreads specifically. "
"21614030","21618410"," But back spreads still sitting at 568 million to the south side."
"21618810","21621510"," So right in here, they're trying to sell down and work."
"21622050","21623750"," This is just like the 28th. "
"21623750","21624590"," Remember in February?"
"21625090","21627750"," And I was like, this isn't as strong either."
"21628430","21630670"," This is not as strong as the weekly and monthly momentum."
"21631910","21635890"," So when you're in here and you're seeing this level, this is not as strong as that weekly and"
"21635890","21636190"," monthly. "
"21636530","21640410"," It's not going to take them a week or two to plunge just below it at some point."
"21642870","21647070"," Any bullshit news over the weekend will at least go down for a squeeze low and then will rip up"
"21647070","21647770"," rip face higher."
"21649230","21650530"," So Sunday show up. "
"21650650","21651570"," We'll talk about that trade."
"21652290","21656790"," We'll be blast down and come rip and face ripping back up to wherever these these swellers are."
"21657250","21659450"," Wherever these swellers are on Monday. "
"21660350","21664570"," That's the place for the next rip higher, like a bear rip, right bear market rip."
"21665070","21667570"," And then you get into that put back spread and you should be safe."
"21670250","21672070"," And you can short the market safely. "
"21672610","21676750"," It's one of the easiest ways if we're going to make a leg down out of short the market."
"21676750","21678710"," If the market goes higher, you get paid."
"21682110","21684250"," Noon Eastern time Sunday. "
"21685250","21686610"," If you can't show up."
"21687350","21693610"," If you can't show up on noon Eastern time Sunday, the video will be available on YouTube recorded"
"21693610","21694650"," for you to check out."
"21695350","21702010"," If you want to do your own due diligence into Sunday and so you have questions to ask about that"
"21702010","21702270"," trade. "
"21702530","21703850"," It doesn't cost a lot of money."
"21703990","21705930"," It's cheap, relatively cheap."
"21707970","21711450"," And there's a limited upside, but there's a lot of downside on it. "
"21711870","21716610"," The upside actually pays for the trade if you get blown out of it."
"21717930","21718970"," Basically a free trade."
"21719110","21724170"," The other way it's not a free trade is if you trade sideways at like 400 for six months or"
"21724170","21724970"," something or three months. "
"21726570","21728950"," It's the only way you get a you don't you don't make any money."
"21729390","21733810"," But you know in that kind of time frame, three months, six months, you're bound to get paid."
"21735230","21737830"," If you get blown out, you can reset the trade. "
"21738150","21740150"," You're like not blown up, but you get paid for the trade."
"21741290","21742710"," You get paid for the trade."
"21744170","21746890"," You can reset the trade for a down move. "
"21747750","21751430"," We we ran this trade in 2022 and it paid dividends."
"21756790","21759650"," So I want you to I want you to all have a great weekend."
"21759650","21760650"," Stay safe. "
"21760810","21762370"," I don't want you to get any trouble this weekend."
"21762710","21763990"," You made a bunch of money this week."
"21764390","21766310"," Don't get pulled over for DWIs. "
"21766430","21769270"," Don't get crazy with family and friends."
"21769430","21774370"," Don't get out of control, but make sure you don't get into any trouble while you're doing it."
"21774450","21774630"," Okay. "
"21775110","21776710"," You don't want to be paying that money to an attorney."
"21777930","21778910"," They're not cheap."
"21779230","21779950"," They're very expensive. "
"21781590","21782570"," We have a discord."
"21783690","21786850"," If anyone wants to join the discord, I'll see if I can get you a link."
"21787010","21788650"," Can anybody drop a link in the discord in there?"
"21789170","21791590"," If anyone's in here with a link, one of the admins. "
"21792230","21797090"," I want to give a special thanks to all the mods, the admins, the producers in the background of"
"21797090","21797510"," this show."
"21798370","21800030"," I want to give a special thanks to Wiki."

"22253470","22255090"," And they come in to sell the open."
"22256110","22256910"," That's my thought. "

"22276560","22280160"," The daily is effing ugly for Monday."
"22284440","22285840"," That's a tough one Joe."
"22293380","22296120"," Man if I had a thought on Monday Joe it's going to be. "

"22302320","22304900"," For everybody. "
"22305100","22309080"," I think right here we are right now you're just looking a short fucking 397."
"22309780","22311940"," That's really the truth with some stops above."
"22312800","22314740"," That really is that's the that's the play. "
"22316660","22320360"," The play is that the play is either short 397 or open flat."
"22320440","22323060"," And if that if 397 has come down on Monday."
"22323700","22325740"," You start short Monday like that's it. "
"22325880","22327220"," That's really the play it's something like that."
"22330180","22330940"," That's the trade."
"22331320","22333120"," I don't think there's a trade over the weekend. "
"22333260","22334040"," I think the trade is."
"22334940","22338920"," Short a high on Monday for all of this stuff comes down onto Monday open."
"22339580","22343000"," And you short right there with stops or with a with a with a ratio spread. "
"22343680","22344780"," That's what I think it is."
"22345380","22349140"," If the ratio spread pays for itself on a move higher you can take the long side."
"22350740","22352640"," That's what I think it is for Monday. "
"22352820","22354280"," That's that's what I call for Monday."
"22356260","22357700"," You wait for Monday to short."

"22369760","22371500"," You you could possibly buy futures."

"22383980","22384600"," It's tough. "
"22384840","22385520"," It's tough call here."
"22385640","22389720"," Jill or go long here and then short Sunday futures if you have to."
