"516490","518409"," Am I on that trade to get there?"
"518710","523330"," Hell yes, I am expressing it through IWM."
"525050","526310"," Not through the spy."
"529910","532450"," The the fly in the ointment for me is. "
"535430","536210"," Small caps."
"538270","544910"," Well, I'm assuming if I'm assuming that you look at small caps and you know that it's on the cusp"
"544910","546990"," of a crash right or it looks like it is."
"547330","553730"," I think there's an apparent. "
"554470","557790"," I think we all know that right."
"557910","558430"," We all look at it."
"558530","561370"," We're like man, small caps about to crash to the depths of hell. "
"562050","564350"," I'm assuming that the Fed is looking at that as well."
"576280","578180"," So oil futures extend losses."
"578480","580460"," Brent crude down by one dollar a barrel now. "

"643330","646570"," Arlie triggers that four fourteen oh six at this point."
"648370","650850"," Talk about the stair casing up of the market."
"654170","656410"," Daily triggers up again today as well. "
"660780","661380"," 1071."

"698820","699680"," Good morning."
"699820","700980"," How are y'all doing out there?"
"701280","702740"," Winky saying buying boil."
"702740","706180"," I've seen Europe gas prices fall below 30 euros. "
"706480","709420"," That's the first time this has happened since June of 2021."
"735200","735640"," Morning."
"735720","736140"," How are y'all doing?"
"736500","736940"," Superman. "
"737380","738660"," Many but many about a good morning."
"738660","739180"," How are you?"
"739460","739680"," Jared."
"739740","740160"," Good morning. "
"740160","740600"," How are you?"
"745560","746620"," Yeah, starting now."
"746760","748360"," Only members of this channel can chat."
"748700","748800"," Yep. "
"749340","749780"," Good morning."
"749980","750300"," How are you?"
"750400","753120"," We're room salute to you as well, Steve."
"756900","758160"," What are the books behind me?"
"765560","766400"," This one right here. "
"766520","768360"," This is the education of a speculator."
"769820","772400"," This is my man here, Victor Nederhopper."
"772600","773900"," He's actually got a son too. "
"774120","775540"," I don't know if his son is still a trader."
"778760","780400"," His son is still active."
"780580","783400"," You can actually find him on Vic is still alive. "
"783900","784420"," He's an older guy."
"784960","786460"," He's on a fin to it."
"786820","788440"," You can actually find him. "
"789260","794220"," He still watches the market to this day and he'll pop on fin to it every once in a while"
"794220","798420"," and make notes about the market where it's at."
"799400","802240"," Usually quite insightful, believe it or not, even at his age."
"803460","806200"," He's one at all and lost it all many times. "
"808320","810040"," So that's a Victor Nederhopper."
"813220","814480"," This one right here."
"814640","821540"," This is models of adaptive behavior in approach based on state. "
"823200","826960"," This is from Alistair I Houston and John McNamara."
"828580","833120"," Now these guys, so back in the 70s and 90s."
"835580","841280"," There were language models being thought out. "
"843380","844740"," This one's pretty fascinating."
"844980","848460"," This one, I think this book costs a couple hundred bucks."
"848700","850580"," I can't carry a member. "
"851000","851460"," Look, this one up."
"851620","852720"," Models of adaptive behavior."
"853040","853620"," This is a rare one. "
"853720","854840"," This one's hard to find."
"860380","861800"," The models of adaptive behavior."
"862120","866260"," So you get on the rabbit hole and you find out that in the nine. "
"866540","874360"," So there was like a rise in the 70s and 90s of language pathways for people that have disabilities"
"874360","877660"," so they can communicate."
"878070","887840"," And these pathways turned into or have progressed"
"887840","897180"," to a point where they've been rolled into modern predictive"
"897180","900180"," models in the stock market."
"900180","901860"," Algorithms, things like that, right?"
"902160","902800"," How do you communicate?"
"903080","903520"," How do you tell?"
"903900","911920"," How do you like get this information and bridge to an answer in the stock market?"
"914700","915320"," Excuse me. "
"915460","922940"," So what you get is like we don't think the rise of indicators back in the 1990s."
"923240","926190"," Believe it or not, but that's what happened, right?"
"927730","930830"," Back in 1990s, you had people selling, believe it or not, believe it or not."
"930910","932570"," They were like selling like EMA's and shit. "
"936030","937970"," And that one guy is very smart, right?"
"938070","938950"," He's the older guy now."
"940830","942050"," Let's see if I can put that book up."
"942390","943890"," I think that book's very expensive. "
"943910","944410"," I can be wrong."
"957060","958400"," Oh, very dry stuff."
"959300","960500"," Let's see if I can find this. "
"964570","966150"," Yeah, it costs a hundred bucks for that book."
"967050","974570"," Now they got it on paperback for $28.98, hardcover, $74 to $168."
"975130","983050"," Matter of fact, if you're a smart person out there, so I read this stuff like white papers and all"
"983050","986230"," this crap from back in the day. "
"988070","993770"," If you're interested in this stuff that I'm talking about, Winky, how about this?"
"994510","1000330"," Is there a way to do a gift for subscribers and members?"
"1001410","1003090"," And I will mail this book out to them."
"1006010","1012250"," If somebody's interested in reading this book, I'd be willing to send it to them."
"1016100","1018600"," We have hedge fund market wizards. "
"1023270","1024369"," This one right here."
"1027030","1029510"," Now, I had not read this book."
"1031089","1037650"," And this was recommended to me from, I believe, Voll Wizard, or possibly, this could have been, I"
"1037650","1042810"," think this was Jedi Marcus recommended this book to me. "
"1044690","1046510"," Hedge fund market wizards."
"1051930","1060810"," And that book was recommended to me as we turned the corner in October, October and December of"
"1060810","1061810"," this year specifically."
"1062530","1067990"," The book the book was recommended to me because if we were going to make a turn in the market,"
"1067990","1071550"," this book specifically discusses it. "
"1071550","1079670"," It discusses the rise of hedge funds, the role of a hedge fund."
"1083170","1092130"," It discusses, it discusses basically, if you're smart, right, if you're a trader, professional"
"1092130","1092570"," trader."
"1095490","1103430"," And you can't put risk on in a large institution, but you, let's say you work for a large"
"1103430","1103690"," institution. "
"1107030","1112170"," You'll make your bones right, make your bones in your profession, let's say with a JPM."
"1113510","1115330"," And you want to put some risk on."
"1115330","1121090"," So I then exit that company and put some risk into the market. "
"1121350","1130690"," And because I have connections with these large institutions, I can get funding"
"1130690","1140470"," basically to put risk into the market, especially when the market is volatile on lows,"
"1140470","1141510"," things like that."
"1141510","1150910"," And these hedge fund, the rise of hedge funds, you want to look for their money when they're"
"1150910","1151850"," entering the market."
"1152750","1156790"," So if you're looking for a bottom, a major bottom in the market, you're going to look for are the"
"1156790","1159110"," hedge funds front running. "
"1159470","1164790"," As a matter of fact, the tickers that we pick on this show, when I show you guys tickers on"
"1164790","1171310"," the show and I say, here's ticker A to look at XYZ for your consideration."
"1172650","1180470"," We are seeking out companies that have IPO in the last three years."
"1181810","1190430"," Companies that we think through analysis are being front run and priced"
"1190430","1192370"," by hedge funds. "
"1196830","1200350"," And so we're looking for the signs that they're there, right?"
"1200490","1210290"," We're looking for signs that some very smart people are looking at publicly traded companies that"
"1210290","1214490"," are new that have fallen off the radar of everybody else."
"1214790","1216130"," You know, everybody's pointing fingers, right?"
"1216130","1219030"," Market crash, market crash, or even just this week."
"1219370","1220270"," Let's say we're down. "
"1220550","1221650"," Let's say this week we're down."
"1223670","1229630"," And we're all pointing fingers at chegg or all pointing fingers saying crash, crash, crash on the"
"1229630","1231310"," SPX, let's say."
"1234050","1238970"," And meanwhile, there's a few companies in the background that aren't following that pattern, right?"
"1239250","1242430"," There's a few companies in the background that are still rising or holding. "
"1246130","1252730"," We need them to meet specific criteria and then also not be selling with the market at large."
"1254930","1258690"," And while we're all pointing fingers over there going, look, market crash, look, market crash,"
"1258790","1263210"," these little companies are just rising, rising, rising in the background."
"1266230","1268570"," And the general public aren't looking at them, right?"
"1270270","1274810"," And these companies, though, are being front-ran by hedge funds. "
"1275330","1280650"," And then eventually this company goes from, I don't know, five bucks and then it's up at 70."
"1283530","1287930"," And then it's at 100 and then it gets on the radar of Wall Street Bets."
"1288730","1294170"," Wall Street Bets is like, ooh, it's the new meme stock, look at it. "
"1294870","1296090"," It's going to go to the moon."
"1296090","1299790"," And it goes like 150, 300 bucks."
"1301330","1303010"," And then they start selling into you. "
"1305950","1312690"," We're trying to find these companies when they're five bucks, ten bucks, 30 bucks, 50 bucks, that"
"1312690","1313130"," kind of stuff."
"1317410","1320270"," Hedge fund market wizard, it's a good one, good book."
"1326330","1330250"," The last one sitting here, I've got a bunch on a shelf back here, I don't know if you can"
"1330250","1330790"," see them, but. "
"1332430","1335330"," This one's finite, this one's good."
"1336190","1339590"," Financial markets and institutions."
"1342430","1348210"," This book right here, some of you might know this book, most of you probably don't. "
"1349990","1355850"," This is a dry book, this is an actual, this is like a textbook."
"1365170","1367030"," So I didn't go to school finance."
"1368190","1369390"," I went to school for business. "
"1371770","1375030"," No one's ever asked, I don't think anyone put the programs ever asked me what I went to school for."
"1375810","1380150"," But I went to school for business and I didn't get a finance degree."
"1381250","1384070"," So I'm like, well, I should educate myself. "
"1386930","1390490"," Like I got a finance degree, right, at least, at least."
"1392490","1396250"," I'm not a finance bro, I got to try to at least learn how to be a finance bro."
"1396750","1400590"," So I spend time, I spend a lot of time actually reading that book. "
"1401690","1404510"," So I have a base understanding of finance."
"1406290","1411490"," And the stock market and the bond market and the Fed and the treasury."
"1413050","1416850"," All these different concepts that you kind of have to know, you have to, you're going to be a"
"1416850","1418430"," finance bro, you kind of know this stuff. "
"1418430","1422050"," A range of four spot five to four spot zero five million expects it."
"1422290","1427230"," The existing home sales change forecast of minus three spot two percent from the prior minus four"
"1427230","1427490"," percent."
"1428470","1433770"," We also see the US leading index change month over month forecast minus zero spot six percent prior"
"1433770","1435590"," minus one spot two percent. "
"1436030","1440870"," Keep in mind at the top of the hour, also expecting the bank of Canada financial system review as"
"1440870","1441150"," well."
"1441810","1444050"," And also getting more comments from a fed Logan as well."
"1444050","1449370"," He's speaking at the Texas bankers association convention followed by a moderated Q&A. "
"1449690","1452190"," So again, text is expected for this is."
"1464430","1467050"," So, sorry, I wasn't like I talk like I talk."
"1467770","1468330"," So, you know. "
"1468630","1471110"," Text Reich allows you to."
"1471250","1474910"," I guess what my point here is like you got to continue to read, right?"
"1475170","1477210"," Continue to educate yourself."
"1478270","1480570"," If anyone's interested in that one book, right?"
"1480810","1481570"," It's a great read. "
"1485430","1491950"," I don't know if we can figure it away to give that book away, maybe have a contest."
"1493490","1496010"," Today and then whoever wins."
"1497170","1500410"," If they send me their their address, I'll mail it out to them. "
"1500890","1501550"," It's a good book."
"1501910","1502810"," It's it's dry reading."
"1503890","1504850"," But it opens a lot. "
"1505070","1506610"," That's actually a bigger conversation."
"1506890","1509790"," That book right there brings us into fractal models."
"1510850","1516490"," Elliot wave in some ways that's not quite related, but it is kind of related to it. "
"1521020","1522120"," What did I go to college?"
"1522740","1529420"," I'm not going to tell you which college I went to, but I started at I started a very small."
"1530620","1533200"," I have a great university story."
"1533200","1537380"," So, I wasn't a great soccer player, but I was pretty good. "
"1538320","1547220"," There was a very small sub Ivy League school that was starting a soccer program."

"15578150","15584990"," guys know You want to see price go below the trend, right, and trend to trade become bearish, and"
"15584990","15592030"," then as always, you want to make sure that the trade is confirmed to the downside."
"15597820","15599540"," That didn't happen, did it?"
"15600880","15602700"," Where was the money in this trade?"
"15603500","15604200"," There's money here."
"15604960","15606140"," Take the money and run. "
"15607860","15613920"," There's money once the trade is confirmed to the downside, the break, right there is where the"
"15613920","15614740"," money is, right there."
"15622880","15626160"," Ooh, look at that, nice new low, nice new low, I didn't even see that."
"15628100","15637900"," New low on the spy, 415-55, bear flag forming on the spy, or bear plane, on"
"15637900","15638720"," Z spy. "
"15643250","15645950"," Let's see if we can get a confirmation that we're going to go down some more."
"15646890","15653650"," Look for a recheck above on 416-31, and try to target that 1470 to the downside here."
"15655290","15658070"," You might just tee off on 416 to the downside. "
"15662270","15663550"," Park in the bus, baby."
"15677160","15681800"," Park in the bus, I don't pick, so, I mean, what my take is on this market is we're likely"
"15681800","15685380"," going to trade 420 into the month."
"15685680","15688420"," We're likely going to trade 430 in the end of the month. "
"15689080","15690020"," We're up here for a reason."
"15690820","15695840"," If we don't ever see 420, if 418 was the top, that was your double top rejection."
"15696320","15697780"," We did miss a tick up here. "
"15699100","15702260"," We failed to get above that 418-32."
"15703160","15704920"," This is a lower high."
"15706640","15707820"," Still testing microphone. "
"15709900","15716840"," If we're not able to get a new high above 418-32, you want to get bearish, I'm with you."
"15718800","15719740"," We'll trade it down."
"15719860","15720440"," We'll buy a bunch of puts. "

"15751690","15753350"," Can't get back above it, bye-bye."
"15753850","15756650"," That reversal candle at the top looks pretty gnarly."
"15757310","15761510"," Looks like the end of other rallies, but too soon, of course, to call. "
"15762390","15763750"," Those puts were a good idea."
"15763990","15764830"," Reversal, possibly."

"16001180","16006620"," I think we were talking to, we were talking to Mr. Yann yesterday and someone after Mr. Yann had"
"16006620","16011480"," left someone and said, what kind of stupid shit do you used to do and when did Mr. Yann break"

"16034690","16045390"," 670% right now, didn't close them, that's true, you"
"16045390","16051970"," know, I was in an apple trade and I was like, I think I was in it for, I don't"
"16051970","16056670"," know, $60, $70,000 or something like that."
"16057310","16063310"," And I was up like 30, 40% on the trade, it was an earnings trade."
"16063310","16066730"," I like going up, going up, going up, going up, going up. "
"16067250","16074070"," So some commentary as well from Catherine Simonetta who's a Morgan Stanley private wealth manager"
"16074450","16079510"," said the Fed is in a really tough spot as they told a TV interview that the big decision for"
"16079510","16084730"," them is in the timing here because once they announced that they're done raising rates, markets are"
"16084730","16089990"," just going to assume that they've succeeded and it might not necessarily be the case version so far"
"16089990","16091070"," is proving to be sticky."
"16091070","16097210"," So again, it's according to Morgan Stanley's private wealth management from Simonetta on a TV"
"16097210","16098030"," interview earlier."
"16101250","16102730"," Yeah, chart doesn't look good, right?"
"16104270","16105790"," Look at my bloodbath's coming up. "
"16109300","16116000"," So I'm in this, I'm in this trade and I'm up like 30, 40% and it's an earnings trade"
"16116000","16122740"," and I'm like, dude, I should just take the money and run because a lot of money is making a"
"16122740","16123500"," lot of money."
"16123500","16125660"," And I'm like, like, how much do you need?"
"16126240","16128620"," I don't need to hit it big."
"16130820","16137140"," I didn't take the trade off and I woke up like the next day and it was down like, like"
"16137140","16143520"," down like I was under I was like went to zero and profit and then I was down like 30%. "
"16144120","16146200"," And I'm like, fuck."
"16147920","16152560"," And so now I was tied into the trade."
"16152560","16157720"," And you like you have to think like, do I cut my losses here?"
"16157980","16160120"," Is the earnings trade over?"
"16163640","16169340"," So the docket is clear now for the rest of the US session today, just looking ahead to the APAC"
"16169340","16169680"," session. "
"16169820","16171960"," Where would you get the release of the Japanese CPI numbers?"
"16172200","16174920"," That's at around 730 p.m. Eastern time today."
"16178000","16180480"," Big old bear flag forming up here, boys."
"16181640","16181840"," See it?"
"16182620","16185540"," Not bear flag, but bear plane giant bear plane right here. "
"16196120","16201620"," So I'm in this trade and I'm like, like, is the earnings so I'm trading trading this for an"
"16201620","16204960"," earnings trade, like not actual earnings, just the run up into earnings."
"16205960","16207760"," And I'm kind of like trapped in this trade."
"16208900","16210560"," I'm like, what do I do?"
"16210980","16214740"," I'm like, like, do I fucking do I just take the L?"
"16216020","16219640"," Do they grind me into into the earnings?"
"16220080","16221320"," Is the earnings bad?"
"16221500","16222680"," Does it sell the news into earnings?"
"16222960","16226300"," What is like, like, all these different, you know, thoughts and ideas going through my head?"
"16230450","16237730"," Or do I just this and this is the time I probably should have just closed and taken the L."
"16237970","16240170"," My view point, like 2020 back vision. "
"16242130","16245030"," So if I was like a trader today, I would have taken the L."
"16245230","16245570"," I would have had a look."
"16245730","16246890"," I would have had a stop limit on it."
"16247210","16249110"," I would have taken profit. "
"16249490","16251810"," Like 30, 40% I should have been happy, walked away, been done."
"16252930","16253570"," Good enough."
"16256850","16260750"," And then when I was upside down and the trader I am today, I would have probably taken the L."
"16261170","16263610"," So both things I would have done that I wouldn't do then. "
"16266580","16268000"," But I stayed in that trade."
"16270500","16271860"," So I'm like, that's it."
"16272060","16274360"," I'm going to stay in this trade for this apple earnings. "
"16277900","16285280"," So I diamond handed and they announced the stock split."
"16286900","16288020"," It did really well."
"16288180","16288860"," I made a lot of money. "
"16291660","16294000"," But I am not that trader today."
"16295300","16298440"," I think that's the more or less or I think that's the lesson."
"16299940","16308100"," If I ran that trade 10, 20 times, probably would be a loser on seven of them, four of them,"
"16309340","16310580"," six of them, like a big loser. "
"16315560","16318260"," So apologies just doing another quick microphone test."
"16323740","16325240"," Run the bear jams, baby."
"16325240","16326680"," I'm going to go take a leak real quick. "
"16326760","16327860"," I'll bury it back in two seconds."
"16328640","16329780"," Keep your eyes on."
"16330520","16333680"," Keep your eyes on this red right here. "
"16336220","16341520"," And there's more liquidity below, baby, right down there."
"16342940","16345360"," Some more more bear jams down there."
"16346060","16347100"," Let me just one second. "
"16347200","16436290"," I got a potty real quick bear in"
"16436290","16441590"," mind that Senator McHenry earlier said that there's nothing close to being done on the debt ceiling"
"16441590","16441890"," talks."
"16442470","16446210"," Despite that, we have also heard comments from Senator."
"16449950","16454890"," From US Senate Majority Leader Schumer, who says the debt limit negotiations are currently making"
"16454890","16455390"," progress. "
"17050940","17052480"," All right, I'm back with you."
"17053880","17057900"," So I went to potty and then I was talking to a couple of people off stream."
"17057900","17060420"," So I want to talk to you guys about something here. "
"17064920","17066280"," Bring this up in the shot."
"17066500","17066700"," Okay."
"17069720","17077260"," So I want you to see, I want you to look right here, okay?"
"17079380","17082020"," This is support. "
"17083120","17089420"," I want you to know that this is the market support, okay?"
"17095520","17097080"," That is right here."
"17098080","17104660"," This is the market support right down here."
"17116670","17119650"," I want to point your attention to a couple of things. "
"17121270","17129120"," It's a pretty decent example here."
"17130520","17138740"," Traded up, came back down and checked twice the hourly trigger."
"17139880","17142200"," We ripped faces off to the upside. "
"17143400","17149160"," It's a key pivotal moment for the market, market support."
"17151480","17156920"," The next time we came back down, we retested the hourly trigger."
"17157880","17161400"," Price broke underneath the hourly trigger. "
"17162560","17164180"," We ripped down to the downside, right?"
"17167200","17169600"," We have our first check here."
"17170740","17174380"," We're coming into our second check right now."
"17175300","17179480"," We're either going to bounce for a much bigger move up. "
"17180860","17182800"," Come on here, let's move this maybe."
"17185300","17192200"," Either going to bounce here for a much larger extension, get above that 420, or if we get"
"17192200","17198560"," underneath the hourly trigger, we have a target down below of 410."
"17199600","17201780"," And likely more downside underneath there. "
"17202620","17204080"," You can see it right there."
"17204700","17206560"," The target hit it over here."
"17207300","17210200"," Squeezed back up the hourly rolls over. "
"17211680","17214360"," Bam, bam, and bam to the downside."
"17215660","17219040"," Bam, bam to the upside."
"17222360","17224660"," We're kind of coming into that zone right now. "
"17230520","17231520"," See it right here?"
"17235550","17243970"," It's at $4.14.76. So what can we extrapolate"
"17243970","17251620"," from this?"
"17266020","17268500"," Currently, the hourly is overbought, right?"
"17269880","17274320"," Top of, and we're at the top of hourly trend."
"17275080","17276200"," It's kind of like sell the market, right?"
"17276980","17278600"," It comes back down, you buy the market, right?"
"17278600","17283060"," Right now, I'm like, can it continue to go up?"
"17283180","17283340"," Sure."
"17285500","17287620"," We're going to look for a dip to buy down here. "
"17294040","17296080"," So this is kind of our area."
"17300030","17304530"," Either here, down here, or even a quick rip down to go back up higher."
"17305190","17312490"," So we're getting close to that zone of longing the markets with stops underneath. "
"17314930","17324170"," So somewhere in here, you're going to expect dip buyers to show up or move higher."
"17326390","17327790"," Buy a position, add to your position."
"17328010","17328930"," Now, a little bit more to your position. "
"17330450","17340480"," If price breaks below, let's"
"17340480","17343880"," say you buy the dip here, and you're like, ah, should I get a buy the dip again?"
"17344660","17349200"," You buy the dip again, buy the dip again, and you see this happen here with price."
"17351080","17355080"," You know you're going to have to have stops somewhere in here, right?"
"17355600","17357260"," And switch to being a bear."
"17358440","17360220"," So your stops are going to be right in here. "
"17369890","17371150"," Can you see what I'm saying here?"
"17372470","17374930"," Before a multi-day trade to the upside."
"17376070","17377890"," Or a multi-day trade to the downside."
"17381390","17382770"," So I'm going to pause it. "
"17385370","17389110"," Supports at $4.14.76. Trend to the upside."
"17390810","17394090"," Lays on $4.14.76 in and around there."
"17397920","17402300"," Smart money is down here trying to buy this for the next leg up. "
"17406900","17416640"," I will also become bearish if we trade below this and confirm the move is down."
"17417440","17419300"," So you break below this hourly trigger."
"17420040","17422860"," We probably will squeeze back up. "
"17423720","17428300"," And you want to see full rejection here, like you shall not pass."
"17433700","17436320"," Your price targets on that."
"17436460","17438060"," I'm going to give you two price targets on that. "

"19046550","19047550"," I understand that."
"19048470","19049930"," And I open myself up to it, right?"
"19050030","19050230"," I'm streaming. "
"19051070","19058190"," I hold myself up to people getting angry in the chat and stuff like that or pushing counter alpha."

"19062870","19068190"," I'll explain them more clearly today than just being pissed off the other day. "
"19068630","19076410"," Number one, this stream specifically is not a stock picking show, right?"
"19076590","19078770"," We're trying to launch a stock picking show on Saturdays."
"19080310","19085310"," Like in that chat, you want to be talking about, hey, we should sell these tickers and buy these"

"19091210","19092550"," That's what we focus on here, basically. "
"19094510","19099410"," So, number one, I need the alpha in the chat to be accurate."
"19101550","19104230"," I can't have it run over the conversation."
"19104630","19107050"," I can't have the counter alpha run over the conversation. "
"19108290","19117030"," Can't have counter alpha poisoning, traitors, default pieces and what's going to happen."
"19123960","19129140"," And sometimes people come into the chat and they'll try to push buttons, right?"
"19129320","19134520"," I'm going to come in and I'm going to push buttons in this stream like rage post or whatever it"
"19134520","19135220"," is that people do."
"19135500","19135780"," I get it. "
"19138540","19140520"," We're growing as a channel too, right?"
"19140880","19144060"," People know, kind of know who we are, what we're doing over here, what you guys are doing, over and"
"19144060","19149180"," over here, people know who Winky is, people know who you are, you guys know who you are, so I"
"19149180","19150300"," don't know."
"19150560","19155020"," I don't mind reopening the chat up because I like foresight finance is a great example."
"19155280","19156140"," I fucking love that guy. "
"19156940","19159520"," I love him."
"19159740","19160140"," He's awesome."
"19161380","19168060"," We know that foresight finance is making jokes in the chat and we understand that, so he's fine. "
"19168340","19173040"," I don't mind joking around in the I don't mind all that stuff."
"19173200","19174660"," I don't mind foresight finance at all."

"19175200","19175740"," That's awesome."
"19176380","19178520"," So I don't want to lose him from our chat."
"19179260","19180740"," So how do I find that balance, right?"
"19180980","19186480"," Where it's like maybe we open it up, try it open, maybe after this month, we'll do one month on"
"19186480","19193400"," the subscription or I can refund you all your money or something like that before we leave it on. "
"19193660","19193980"," I don't know."
"19194080","19194800"," I don't know what the answer is."
"19194800","19196420"," You let me know in the chat what you think you paid. "
"19197280","19199640"," So if you want to keep it paid, fine with that too."
"19201220","19204040"," But there's like two things and then there's a third thing, right?"
"19204140","19208460"," If you do want to come in and be like, yeah, fuck cap Jim James, you're going to pay me"
"19208460","19208820"," to do it."
"19208900","19209600"," This is my point, right?"
"19210480","19212020"," So you want to come in my stream, fuck with me?"
"19212660","19213100"," No problem. "
"19213100","19213760"," You're paying me."
"19214240","19214540"," Fuck away."
"19215020","19215620"," You know what I mean?"
"19217360","19218460"," There's like a part to that. "
"19218640","19226060"," There's another part of it where because it's free, which I like that model, but for some reason,"
"19226720","19230440"," if you charge something, anything, five bucks, one buck doesn't matter."
"19230660","19232580"," People put more, they wait it."
"19232720","19233760"," They're like, this means something. "
"19234300","19237040"," So we're keeping on the mentors down around."
"19237180","19238280"," It's valuable to somebody."
"19238500","19239540"," People put value on stuff. "
"19239700","19240480"," I don't know why they do that."
"19240560","19242200"," I don't know what the psychology of that is."
"19242440","19242900"," It's kind of crazy. "
"19244880","19246980"," Hey, I paid this guy a thousand bucks a month, man."
"19249100","19250860"," You know, there's like value in that."
"19250960","19253680"," I don't know why that psychology exists out there. "
"19254840","19255700"," But it's true."
"19255840","19256200"," It's there."
"19256740","19264020"," So I don't know how do we just try to find these people and say, hey, I'll get you in"
"19264020","19264320"," or something. "
"19264540","19265200"," I don't know what to do."
"19266220","19267500"," Here's the other part of it too."
"19268080","19269100"," This is the last part of it. "
"19271720","19272840"," Here's the last part of it."
"19274120","19283360"," If you really do want to join us in chat right now, you can go to, I think most of"
"19283360","19284280"," you have Amazon Prime."
"19285300","19292960"," You can go to Amazon Prime and you can join up through Twitch there. "
"19294060","19294920"," Become a subscriber."
"19295360","19296140"," You don't pay anything."
"19296760","19298240"," It's zero dollars to you. "
"19298600","19298940"," Zero."
"19300120","19302660"," And you're taking five dollars from Bezos."
"19303740","19304740"," He keeps 250. "
"19305020","19307180"," I think Twitch keeps 250 and they give me 250."
"19307460","19308380"," I think that's how it goes."
"19310180","19311640"," And that takes five minutes. "
"19312140","19313220"," Let's go over to Amazon Prime."
"19314600","19316480"," Subscribe on Twitch and you watch me on Twitch."
"19317520","19319840"," So there's like a work around already in place. "
"19322730","19327610"," And what it does having the, having like a subscription, not a subscription, but a, was it"
"19327610","19328510"," memberships on YouTube?"
"19329410","19334210"," Is it weeds out that, that, it weeds out that, that person, right?"
"19334970","19336850"," Weeds out the person that you don't want in the chat."
"19337850","19342270"," Now they're not going to take the time to like, I'm going to go sign up on Twitch Amazon Prime,"
"19342530","19345090"," give this asshole 250 and then I'm going to go bitch at them."
"19345810","19347150"," They don't want to see me get a dollar. "
"19347770","19351850"," So just based on, you know, just based on that, that's, that will happen."
"19353390","19354150"," So we'll try."
"19354330","19358150"," We're going to stay with this model right now, I think, but if you can come up with some solutions,"
"19358910","19362030"," any other solutions I'm all game for, I'm game for it. "
"19369930","19371970"," Yeah, David, that was a great trade right here, right?"
"19372190","19374390"," This was a beautiful, perfect trade right here, man."
"19375270","19376590"," Take the money and run."
"19381190","19382730"," So let me know in the chat what you think. "
"19384530","19385530"," I'll say something."
"19385890","19392090"," If you are a subscriber through prime, subscriber through Twitch, subscriber through YouTube, I"
"19392090","19392770"," know you're serious."
"19393830","19395310"," I know you're here to make money. "
"19396410","19399650"," I know you're here to win, up or down."
"19400810","19405230"," And I'll be honest, the chat past two days has been very good."
"19405710","19409150"," Like, I mean like fucking alpha in the chat all day long. "
"19411450","19413090"," So I don't know what to say on that."
"19415870","19418860"," Um, you know, I don't know."
"19418960","19420820"," Oh, wow, look at all that shit going on right now. "
"19421180","19423480"," Phone phone on 99 gifted a tear."
"19423960","19426280"," And you guys don't want to see me angry in the chat, right?"
"19426400","19428080"," You don't want to see me on stream trying to focus."
"19428600","19434300"," I'm reading a chat with somebody that's like, we're going to egg this motherfucker until he's"
"19434300","19435220"," losing his concentration. "
"19435300","19437980"," Like you guys need me to be in a good mood."
"19438200","19442760"," You guys need me to be focused on where the market is going."
"19444200","19449000"," You don't need some clown in here like clowning on me so that I get angry. "
"19450040","19454200"," And, you know, let's be honest, if you don't like what I do or what my stream is, there's a"
"19454200","19457800"," million other places that you can go watch other streams."
"19458040","19459040"," You can go watch options, millionaires."
"19459440","19460160"," I think he's on in the day. "
"19460280","19463680"," I think, um, markets in mayhem has a stream on, I think, right?"
"19463820","19464840"," Does he have a stream on every day?"
"19465560","19466220"," Hang out in this stream."
"19466600","19468620"," You know, maybe you like that content better than my content."
"19468840","19469580"," You don't feel like my content. "
"19470660","19474080"," Um, you know, so I don't know what to say on this subject."
"19482110","19493320"," Yeah, I"
"19493320","19498220"," think you go to prime gaming and you subscribe to me on Twitch there."
"19498440","19498640"," I don't know. "
"19498780","19500740"," Maybe Winky can describe the best way to do it."
"19502660","19507740"," Subscribe to your favorite or whatever, like a Twitch person on prime gaming and then I don't know"
"19507740","19508520"," exactly how it's done."
"19520580","19520940"," Yeah. "
"19525070","19529350"," Yeah, I don't know how to, I don't know how to um, I don't know how to do it."
"19529630","19536890"," Like, so that's, and that's my biggest thing is like, um, how do we like try like, you're not going"
"19536890","19539650"," to stop people, um, necessarily, right?"
"19539790","19543590"," If they go sign up on Twitch and then they're like, you suck Kevin Jim James or something on"
"19543590","19543810"," Twitch."
"19544270","19547290"," Um, like those people tend to come and go away if you ignore him too. "
"19548450","19555670"," Uh, but sometimes the, the alpha is so counter that it's like, man, like, just too much."
"19560130","19560910"," Right on right on."
"19565500","19566780"," No, you don't pay anything. "
"19567200","19567900"," You don't pay nothing."
"19568060","19568420"," You just go."
"19568620","19575460"," If you're a prime, so if you're a prime member, you go to, um, prime gaming and you can just"
"19575460","19579720"," subscribe to Captain Jim James and then boom, you're now, you can now comment on Twitch. "
"19581820","19582480"," That's free."

"19593900","19595460"," get him in the stream to be able to chat."
"19596100","19598740"," So I don't want to lose, we have great commenters in our chat. "
"19599000","19608060"," Like, it's literally like nine of 10 people that are in our chat, maybe more 19 of 20, maybe higher"
"19608060","19609520"," are kick ass."
"19610340","19611700"," And there's like one bad apple."
"19612980","19617240"," And you're like, fuck man, this one mother fucker is going to ruin it for all these other, uh, cool"
"19617240","19617560"," people. "

"19683110","19686150"," I got no real, I don't want to come to the stream and be like, I'm not having a good"
