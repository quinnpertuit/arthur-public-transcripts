"131070","131970"," Good morning, everybody. "
"132790","134370"," Could actually just start reading the comments out there."
"134490","134850"," How y'all doing?"
"135530","136310"," Everybody's doing well."
"137850","139310"," You guys hear me all right out there?"
"139770","145910"," I made some changes on the back end of production. "
"146850","154610"," I also noticed that my microphone was instead of properly, whatever, and then good morning."
"155930","156510"," Took a vacation."
"158170","159290"," Kind of odd. "
"159470","169150"," We have to be a"
"169150","174190"," better We did a poll a couple of weeks ago, and I don't think that the poll was enough."
"174970","178490"," I think I was supposed to take two weeks to go off, and I said, no fucking way."
"178530","180110"," We're going to F or Opex. "
"181510","182730"," We'll take the next week off."
"184750","186210"," I am refreshed, rejuvenated."
"186510","192610"," You know what the truth is, is I didn't get nearly enough that I needed to get done, done at"
"192610","195290"," this point, close, but still not done. "
"198150","200730"," I think I actually have to work on part of it this morning."
"204350","205570"," We'll get right into it."
"205890","209290"," I have to work on part of that this morning, so if you're just joining us, welcome back. "
"209930","210910"," I did take a vacation."
"211010","211830"," I needed a vacation."
"212270","212850"," I needed a vacation. "
"213070","214590"," I need to get a lot of stuff done."
"214710","215890"," We'll talk about that at some point this morning."
"215890","222490"," Before we open the morning up right here, we should see some weakness here. "
"223010","226170"," Spy right now is trading below the one in five minutes."
"226730","233890"," We have some economic reports coming out to open up the week here at nine forty five."
"233890","239970"," We have an S&P US manufacturing and then a 10 a.m. We have ISM manufacturing construction spending. "
"240670","244310"," We're going to get into some other things coming out this week."
"244310","246550"," We've got course FOMC."
"247610","251490"," We've got some GDP kind of stuff, some PC kind of stuff. "
"252430","256290"," And then we've got, we have some volatility this week."
"256550","259390"," We'll be able to talk about the upcoming week here."
"259390","260750"," What to expect. "
"261670","267610"," Although I do don't expect a lot of volatility until we get into the FOMC meeting and we have some"
"267610","268770"," range expansion here."
"268970","275490"," So just on the open this morning, we'll look at the implied move for today, but I really want you"
"275490","278930"," to put the key point here is to look at the range expansion that we have."
"278930","284850"," We have our three above at four twenty one ninety six and then as three down below here at four"
"284850","287030"," oh eight forty one. "
"288650","289430"," Hold on here."
"289750","290110"," Hang tight."
"295590","297910"," I don't know why that's not showing up here. "
"298070","298930"," Let me put it on the one hour."
"301550","303790"," Right down here, this little green box right here."
"303890","305030"," Just want you to see the hourly here. "
"305530","307890"," It's been a kind of a good place to buy a dip on."
"308790","312850"," So just so you see this hourly down below here at four fourteen four thirteen ninety seven."
"313310","315190"," Keep your eye on that this morning. "
"316370","318630"," That four four four four four fourteen."
"319030","323910"," If you're a bear, you want to be getting underneath that four fourteen and then just in the five"
"323910","324430"," minute here."
"325050","326810"," Let's see what we open this up here. "
"329930","331290"," Got a little bit of a."
"334270","335190"," Walkiness right here."
"343380","344660"," And reset this."
"348100","352440"," Nice little three trigger squeeze on the one minute chart for the five minute chart right here. "
"352460","353320"," I didn't even notice this."
"353800","356240"," Price is above the one end five at this point."
"363100","363860"," Just sitting here. "
"383000","386080"," If price stays above four fifteen forty five, we should go higher."
"388320","391480"," I'm not going to expect a lot of all here until we get to the FOMC."
"391600","392580"," We'll talk about that as well. "
"393380","398380"," I'm interested in down below here for buying four fourteen flat if that's possible."
"398680","399060"," Good morning everybody."
"399180","399640"," How's everybody doing?"
"400320","401200"," Good to see you all. "
"401400","401920"," Nice to be back."
"405990","406390"," Chase."
"406670","407870"," I'm reading what Chase just said. "
"408030","410670"," Not trading got something to go do on Wednesday and go on camera four days."
"411030","411650"," Hell yeah."
"412490","416250"," If you haven't taken a break from the market, I highly recommend it. "
"416310","417790"," Chase is saying I need a break."
"417990","418610"," I'm telling you what?"
"419150","420370"," I needed a fucking break."
"420810","422370"," Well, I had a ton of shit to do. "
"422970","424970"," But then I needed a break."
"425310","429370"," Like every F, every opx specifically the quarters."
"430070","431490"," I'm like, I'm taking a couple days off. "
"432050","434790"," This past year, I haven't taken any time off."
"435270","439350"," The time off that I've taken from streaming has been just market closures."
"439690","443410"," Like if you guys remember during the holidays this winter, I took no time off. "
"443610","448870"," I streamed right through all the holidays when the market was open."
"449490","450890"," I didn't take a week off, anything like that."
"451530","455810"," And I just needed a refresh, reboot, my batteries, that kind of stuff. "
"455970","460290"," And I had a lot of crazy part is when you don't take a lot of time off and then"
"460290","464450"," you finally do, you realize how much."
"465870","470210"," Of course, my wife has been not the most pleasant person to be around."
"470950","475290"," But due to me, not being available to take breaks, to be honest. "
"475950","478610"," And so they're off taking vacations without me."
"479110","484770"," And when I finally took this past week off, it was like an avalanche of stuff that I had to"
"484770","490950"," accomplish and stuff that I don't pay attention to that I normally should be paying attention to."
"491310","496230"," I had like, I was looking at some, I have some computers at a repair store that I've just been"
"496230","497210"," sitting there for months. "
"498650","499550"," Just sitting there."
"500170","501310"," It's like shut up the repair store."
"501470","502650"," I'm like, hey, how are my computers doing?"
"502870","506750"," Like, you know, just like, you know, it's bizarre. "
"507010","508770"," It's like, man, I need, I need some time off."
"509450","510710"," I need to live like a normal human being."
"511630","514090"," Anyways, we got a bunch to talk about that too. "
"514630","516490"," Because I lost some money on FRC."
"516490","518429"," We'll talk about that at some point today."
"519470","522150"," Took a, took a, took a beating on FRC. "
"523150","526190"," Not a ton of money, but if it had been a lot of money."
"526430","530670"," Normally when I start positions in companies, it's a hundred shares at a time."
"531450","536230"," You know, like Tesla is a lot more risk, monetarily. "
"536230","537730"," FRC, not so much."
"538570","541130"," But still, I ended up getting caught in FRC."
"541450","542890"," Actually, I was up on FRC. "
"543550","544870"," Then I got caught in FRC."
"544870","547630"," I did my market update last week Friday or something."
"548510","549990"," I was like, I'm going to close this in the close. "
"550510","552850"," I'm doing my hourly or my one hour rant."
"553630","554410"," I'm turning it off."
"555290","557430"," It just started blasting down after hours. "
"558050","559030"," And then I bought it again."
"560110","561670"," This time with a stop on it."
"561670","565730"," I ended up selling off again and I closed the entire position out. "
"565890","567410"," But we'll talk about that at some point today too."
"569250","573750"," And I still have some positions of the market for IWM in June, late June."
"574670","576030"," So anyway, we'll talk about this this morning. "
"576390","579030"," Right now in the five minute chart, Spy is holding up."
"579170","584590"," Okay, we are above, we are above 4.15, 56, or above the five minute."
"586030","587650"," Although I'm not buying this. "
"587650","592630"," I don't want to buy this with some reports coming out at 9.45 and at 10 a.m. We"
"592630","595690"," raise higher and then it just reverses and blasts down."
"596630","598930"," They put some shorts in the market and stuff like that."
"599050","602050"," So I have no interest in the open here on Monday, personally. "
"603070","605070"," Now, with all that said, that's the beginning."
"606110","607350"," First off, welcome back everybody."
"609870","613210"," Secondly, if you've been expecting a phone call from me, you're going to get one today. "
"613210","620110"," I'm going to be on air today, but taking a large portion of this day where I'm sitting here working"
"620110","620590"," in the background."
"621310","622950"," Well, the stream just stays up."
"623130","631430"," I need to make some time available for some people that I've been promising things to. "
"631970","636110"," And then I've been working on this week and this is the time to start launching that stuff."
"636110","641890"," So you're going to see last are not you're not going to see me here just blabbing for eight"
"641890","644410"," straight hours every day from this point forward."
"644430","646450"," Also, another programming note. "
"647910","649450"," I am picking up."
"650370","653370"," The last part of a second."
"654030","655650"," Streaming rig complete. "
"656130","657530"," This is like another."
"659130","661810"," Five or $6,000 worth of shit."
"663070","667150"," Although it's been repaired and I've purchased in the past and working on it. "
"668090","671210"," So key point behind this programming note is."
"671910","678970"," There should be no reason why I can't stream every day as long as I'm not in town or something."
"679610","684510"," Like here physically here with the second streaming setup. "
"684770","687070"," I can put a stream up even if I'm not here."
"687470","689330"," I feel like so oftentimes I don't."
"689470","691810"," You guys will probably I can't take it a day off and I don't put a stream up. "
"692270","693310"," It is due to."
"695630","698370"," Computing that I need with part of this studio."
"699550","701190"," So I was like fuck this. "
"701210","705530"," I'm going to put I'm going to put a second streaming rig up and dedicate it."
"705630","707830"," I got a fiber finally came to my house."
"708870","711810"," Fibers not here yet, but it's going to be here in the next week or two. "
"712730","714010"," So I should be able to."
"714010","716090"," This is like a gig or more or something."
"717130","719030"," Especially in the upload is kind of the key. "
"720570","724950"," So you're going to get as long as I'm here or someone's here where I am."
"725750","730370"," You'll you should be able to get a stream every day consistently from this point forward."
"730510","731990"," So there's some major changes going on the background. "
"732210","734210"," Some really some good stuff to talk about."
"735730","738450"," Another thing I put I put this like new thing on where."
"738930","743510"," If the guy from financial juice is blabbing like the squawkers talking. "
"744010","745970"," I can cut his ass right out whenever I want."
"746250","746770"," It's kind of cool."
"749170","749710"," What else?"
"749830","752290"," You got a bunch of stuff cool stuff in the background I'm working on. "
"753830","756450"," Anyways, working on a white paper for the trigger stuff."
"757130","758590"," Working on the tool and all that kind of stuff."
"760650","764650"," Anyways, all that all that said for myself on this open right now. "
"764770","766570"," This looks I mean normally in a normal circumstances."
"767290","768370"," I'd be buying this."
"770150","770970"," But the next. "
"771910","772950"," I buy this right now."
"773430","777690"," For me right now, I'm not going to buy this only because I don't like the idea of."
"778490","780310"," The reports that you have coming out. "
"781390","782830"," Here in just the next few minutes."
"782850","786390"," I always like that this kind of shit like a nine forty five ten o'clock report."
"786950","788290"," It's kind of somewhere you like Yahoo. "
"788710","790250"," And then it just rips lower for a minute."
"790710","792470"," And the actual buy was down here."
"793390","794250"," Does that make sense?"
"795050","797530"," Now if I miss this so be it. "
"797630","800270"," I want like nine forty five of the past to name the past."
"800770","802450"," And I'll jump on board with you."
"802510","803850"," I'll do the Yahoo's above here. "
"804990","806730"," And see if we're going higher now."
"807150","812830"," We got a bunch of stuff to talk about for what your expectations are for the next month."
"813550","814570"," For May, right?"
"815470","817730"," I am expecting a selling main go away. "
"818230","819310"," I'm going to say that right away."
"819510","821190"," I'm expecting selling may go away."
"821190","823870"," We're going to talk about seasonality. "
"824590","826170"," We're going to talk about what's strong."
"826890","828990"," Even with selling may and go away."
"829850","836070"," I would not take the would not be take the positive of that's a thirty six hundred or three"
"836070","837770"," thousand or thirty two hundred. "
"837970","839090"," Anything like that."
"839890","841970"," We should close the month and I believe it or not."
"843030","844730"," Even with selling may and go away. "
"845910","848390"," We're going to talk about rotation into other sectors."
"848390","852290"," There's two weird things to be looking at right now."
"852450","855490"," There's there's like normal seasonal rotation. "
"856570","858810"," And then there's business cycle rotation."
"859650","867070"," And both of those are not giving clear signals for what to expect in May, June and July."
"867890","871810"," I might even be me asking you for your input on that. "
"872570","874030"," What to expect the month of May."
"874170","877130"," We're already blasting higher right now trading four sixteen fourteen."
"878490","879910"," We have our one above. "
"880290","884690"," You've got a couple places above to keep keep an eye on keeping eye on four sixteen thirty one."
"885050","888110"," And the previous high up here four sixteen sixty three."
"888490","890890"," Our one is above four seventeen forty four. "
"891290","895190"," You remember when we started the broadcast this morning I told you we have some range expansion"
"895190","896950"," coming into the market."
"896950","897750"," Believe it or not."
"898370","901230"," We're going to talk about buying volatility today as well. "
"901830","905770"," I'll be buying and holding volatility buying some futures contracts stuff like that."
"907370","908230"," For the future."
"908570","909250"," We're going to look at. "
"909930","911250"," We're going to look at the."
"913410","916170"," Macgago Macgago face cycles bunch of stuff."
"916410","918350"," Got a ton of stuff to go over for a Monday here. "
"921530","922550"," So hang tight here."
"922590","923790"," We're going to go over a couple things here."
"924170","925070"," Just a second. "
"925510","928070"," I hope all of you all of you doing well."
"928070","931590"," Yeah we're going to look at."
"931750","933770"," So season always kind of wonky thing. "
"935330","939130"," Let's seasonality and business cycles right now are a wonky thing."
"939710","944350"," I was asking on Twitter this morning if anyone thinks that we're coming into natural gas season."
"945630","948510"," XLE like energy company season. "
"949370","950430"," We'll talk about that."
"951030","953490"," What else is fascinating to me right now is."
"954630","955250"," Tech. "
"955850","962730"," Now we saw a large sell off in tech right tech seasonally should come back believe it or not for"
"962730","965370"," May, June and July."
"966230","968430"," And so I just haven't scratched my head on some of this stuff."
"969370","978870"," Also XBI industrials should not XBI XLA excuse me XLA should be weak right now. "
"979350","980910"," But in a business cycle."
"980910","983870"," It should start to percolate."
"984190","988030"," We should start to be coming into an industrials. "
"989390","992570"," We're also going to talk today up at some point if I can get around to it."
"994110","996810"," To Ukraine and Russia and."
"997430","1000290"," I haven't done a ton of research on this yet. "
"1000290","1003210"," I went I went down the rabbit hole this week on it."
"1003670","1005710"," But I couldn't find a definitive answer."
"1005710","1008190"," But I don't see too many people talking about it. "
"1008590","1015010"," Probably because it can come off as we can come off as callous."
"1015810","1018590"," But I don't see a lot of talk out there about."
"1020310","1022170"," Some of the reasons why. "
"1023609","1026550"," The sort of soft landing involving war."
"1027290","1028869"," Around the world."
"1030030","1032950"," And the recession us not. "
"1033670","1036230"," The stock market not going into recession."
"1037369","1038930"," Due to war."
"1039650","1041349"," Even if it's proxy war. "
"1042450","1043450"," And the."
"1044790","1048070"," Our we're using our old equipment in Ukraine."
"1048670","1050290"," We're now building new equipment. "
"1051030","1052730"," It's fascinating that Russia."
"1053450","1055550"," Is fighting a proxy war in Ukraine."
"1056010","1058310"," The U.S. is fighting a proxy war in Ukraine. "
"1058830","1060610"," It's almost as if it's timed."
"1060610","1062970"," You know like we're not in a world war everybody."
"1063150","1065790"," If you guys understand anything about short and long term debt cycles. "
"1066310","1067190"," You know that we have."
"1068230","1070570"," They're within these cycles we get."
"1071650","1072290"," We get. "
"1074910","1075610"," We get."
"1075850","1077530"," We'll just say we'll just say like."
"1078290","1080510"," A civil strife at home. "
"1081110","1084510"," This would be like when we had a black lives matter movement."
"1084710","1086610"," We had the fucking Nazis running around."
"1086610","1087130"," We go crazy. "
"1087250","1087610"," It's right."
"1087670","1088770"," You get people protests everywhere."
"1090610","1094050"," And one of the other steps in this of course is taxing corporations. "
"1094530","1097870"," And another part of that cycle is usually war of some kind."
"1099150","1103890"," And even if if if governments are too smart now to go into a world world war."
"1104590","1105490"," Maybe they're. "
"1106410","1107330"," Fighting in Ukraine."
"1108210","1112370"," And lining up China and you fast because you have the three world economies."
"1113190","1116070"," And of course Russia is not big one as big as they think that they are. "
"1116190","1122630"," But you still have three large economies that are gearing up for war and fighting proxy war."
"1124010","1124890"," Even if the."
"1125290","1127530"," Even if war doesn't come in China and Taiwan. "
"1127670","1131890"," If if Ukraine and Russia to come to a truce."
"1132510","1134190"," You then line up Taiwan and China."
"1134510","1139690"," And is that part of the reason we're not the or at least the stock markets. "
"1139690","1142770"," It's not in recessionary decline."
"1143650","1145370"," Normally those companies."
"1146430","1151610"," Defense contractors can blunt and thwart the hard landing. "
"1152110","1153690"," And I don't see that often talked about."
"1154110","1156790"," I'm not quite there yet with an answer to that question."
"1158310","1162630"," I need more data and it's not easy to find. "
"1162770","1169190"," It's not something that many people you'll see like semantic news reporting about it."
"1170610","1172350"," Mostly mostly meant to."
"1174210","1178690"," Playcate people, but the data is a different answer. "
"1183270","1184970"," So anyways, let's talk about some stuff here."
"1186090","1187210"," Let's look at the next week."
"1187510","1188250"," It's a good bunch of stuff. "
"1200420","1202460"," Yeah, if you want the vol events for this week."
"1205660","1207200"," Basically, this is what you're looking for."
"1207300","1209600"," You've got PC coming out volatility. "
"1210740","1214860"," You've got the Fed rate hike decision volatility."
"1215620","1217340"," You've got NFPs."
"1218000","1219300"," That's on the fifth. "
"1219940","1220960"," And then you've got CPI."
"1221660","1223040"," That's your next ball after that."
"1223600","1226260"," And then you've got the debt ceiling, right?"
"1227020","1231760"," We know about the debt ceiling we were talking about on the show non stop garbage talking about it. "
"1232180","1234840"," Those are your big ones for the future here."
"1276180","1280640"," Forecast was 50.4. Came in at 50.2 previously."
"1281060","1284320"," It was 49.0. That's the manufacturing PMI. "
"1285860","1289060"," Squeezing high now trading for 1638 for 1639."
"1318040","1319960"," We're going to take a look at something right now."
"1320860","1362060"," A little"
"1362060","1363900"," bit of resistance here for 1646. "
"1367970","1369310"," We're going to take a look at."
"1374600","1378100"," We'll stay on this on this right now for you so you can see where we're going right now."
"1384600","1386780"," Broke through the previous side from Friday. "
"1412740","1414820"," It's going to run this one over here for you real quick."
"1416260","1417960"," Okay, we're going to take a couple of look."
"1418160","1420440"," Look at a few things here for you this morning. "
"1427400","1429320"," This is a Algomacago face."
"1429880","1431420"," We're going to take a look at Algomacago face."
"1431800","1433140"," And I want you to see a couple things here. "
"1434860","1437720"," We are progressive and regressive."
"1438840","1439760"," EMA is here."
"1441120","1442220"," The dots that you see there. "
"1442340","1447040"," It's hard to show here, but these are dots above and then we've got some X's going down below."
"1447960","1453340"," If we did have any kind of a failure, I'd be looking for a buy down below here at 388."
"1454040","1455480"," 392, I should say. "
"1456420","1457940"," Currently for the future."
"1459860","1465900"," But how the Algomacago is saying for us is that it's calling for this 424-428 above here."
"1466340","1467820"," I don't know that we get that high. "
"1468060","1470520"," I'm trying for just 420 if we can get it."
"1471200","1474520"," And then 430 later in the summer."
"1475160","1477720"," And a new low down here in June. "
"1478000","1479400"," I'm going to expect this to be."
"1479860","1483320"," I don't expect this to be your debt crisis down below here."
"1485660","1489500"," Now that you're going to be paying attention to coming into and just right here. "
"1489940","1491740"," This is Friday, May 5th."
"1492300","1494040"," I want you to see the high on the 5th of May."
"1494440","1495740"," Do I think it's on May 5th?"
"1495920","1496340"," I don't know. "
"1496680","1498180"," Between, I don't think it's the 5th."
"1498260","1499260"," I think it could be the 3rd."
"1499520","1503560"," That's when we have FOMC where you get your high and then we begin to sell May. "
"1505020","1508500"," Then we get a new low in May on May 24th."
"1508500","1512180"," We get a relief rally bounce into the beginning of June."
"1513380","1515400"," And then we trade back down again. "
"1515780","1523760"," I believe part of this is going to be your debt-sailing panic and more debt-sailing panic in the"
"1523760","1524740"," beginning of June here."
"1525380","1528520"," And we go back above again and finally take out that 430."
"1529700","1532780"," And that's some time in late July here. "
"1532940","1534880"," So just pay attention to these as time moves forward."
"1534880","1539500"," I also want you to notice here that's sick on PMO and PPO."
"1541400","1545940"," PPO and PMO is trying for another high here. "
"1546600","1548320"," And you can kind of see that cycle."
"1548760","1552020"," Kind of matches up with this May 5th up in here."
"1552440","1555380"," So at least the PMO, PPO is saying we're going higher. "
"1556240","1559040"," Not that we're going to roll over at this point."
"1564220","1566620"," So May 5th, May 3rd, somewhere in there."
"1566900","1567740"," It says May 5th. "
"1567740","1572260"," My assumption is that Agal McAgalface doesn't know about the FOMC meeting."
"1572800","1577060"," So just into that FOMC meeting, I believe that's the 3rd of May."
"1577360","1578200"," So two more sessions. "
"1579640","1580800"," Murder the VIX a little bit more."
"1603060","1611080"," I don't know how well you can see this, but these are zigzag channels here."
"1611220","1613400"," You can see that we've stayed inside of our channel. "
"1615720","1617720"," Maybe I can change these here."
"1618540","1620400"," Let me see if I can change these zigzag channels."
"1620400","1623660"," Oh no, let's make this one red. "
"1624420","1625940"," And we'll make this thicker."
"1626860","1628160"," Big fat thick one."
"1628760","1630740"," And then we'll make this one, does this work?"
"1631520","1634240"," I think that one green, I guess, here. "
"1635080","1635900"," That works."
"1636920","1637480"," That's okay."
"1638400","1638960"," Not do anything. "
"1640820","1642060"," I really did it."
"1644920","1646980"," I'm not really showing it here."
"1646980","1653740"," Anyways, a big thing to see here is that we were in a downtrend, right?"
"1654060","1655360"," You can see that downtrend. "
"1655800","1658580"," You can see we've now broken out of our downtrend."
"1659200","1662820"," You can also see the dip was bought back here in the middle of March."
"1663240","1664840"," And the dip was bought once again. "
"1665660","1669540"," We are right now still at some resistance here."
"1669880","1671940"," You can see right now we are at some resistance."
"1673940","1679100"," As long as this white line stays above this red line on this PMO. "
"1679380","1680940"," The move is higher."
"1682000","1688500"," What is shocking here is some of the targets above are on the extreme higher here."
"1689080","1690260"," 450, 460. "
"1691660","1694300"," This kind of disagrees with Algo-McGago face."
"1695140","1699700"," Now if we do hold above 420, it's kind of a key level here."
"1699700","1704120"," If we hold above 420, the trend is up. "
"1704480","1709840"," So bulls are going to want to, and bears, of course, this is 4,200 SPX."
"1710460","1714520"," Pay attention to this because this does point the way higher."
"1715520","1719520"," Bulls want to get above to trade this next zone higher. "
"1719820","1724060"," 420 is kind of the key to opening the door to, believe it or not, 460."
"1724060","1724400"," 460."
"1727000","1728520"," Here's July right here. "
"1729800","1732400"," This is actually July 7th."
"1733220","1735700"," That's 474, 476."
"1736160","1737640"," Do I think that we're going up here?"
"1739120","1739720"," Unlikely. "
"1740640","1744100"," I don't like the idea of us coming back down over here."
"1744200","1749080"," I like the idea of us pushing up here into May 5th."
"1749640","1754040"," Right, and then coming back down to find the next leg higher. "
"1754440","1762080"," Even if that is at a lower price somewhere below 4,000, there's 4,000 there to get us higher."
"1762860","1766360"," Or possibly even that 380 that Algo-McGago face is saying."
"1767260","1768040"," So pay attention to that. "
"1768280","1772960"," Pay attention to if you're a bear out there and you see the market begin at some point to roll"
"1772960","1773440"," over."
"1773440","1780980"," If you see the tag higher and you see us blast down here and have some weakness in May to"
"1780980","1782400"," temper your expectations."
"1783360","1784460"," 380, 385. "
"1785800","1786560"," You get that."
"1786940","1787800"," Oh, the market's going to crash."
"1787960","1789240"," The market's going to crash and then boom. "
"1790080","1791780"," There goes the run higher."
"1792160","1797720"," So the nastiest of the worst that I see for the bulls right now."
"1799560","1804220"," Right now for the bulls, the nastiest that I'm seeing is holding 4,000. "
"1804320","1805400"," Everybody hates 4,000."
"1805960","1810600"," But if this market rolls over in May, 4,000."
"1810780","1813940"," If you're a bear out there and you're like, we're getting 3,800, no problem. "
"1814080","1814660"," I'll give you that."
"1816360","1822240"," As far as trading outside of our trend, our trend is up."
"1822580","1824940"," I'm going to tell you, I'll show it to you. "
"1826900","1828000"," Our trend is up."
"1828200","1833220"," It's not like I'm just drawing lines of sheet of paper on the S&P 500, at least the zigzag"
"1833220","1833600"," patterns."
"1834120","1838420"," You can see that on zigzags, at least this is our downtrend. "
"1839040","1840380"," We are now in an uptrend."
"1841720","1844000"," If you want to see this uptrend, get broken."
"1845280","1849760"," You need to see right now a break currently for today. "
"1849880","1851680"," You need to see a break of 4,000."
"1854740","1862740"," And then even then, if you break this, you need the rejection move lower to get that 3,800."
"1863140","1868640"," And that's just right now on May 5th, if we squeeze up, and then you get that bloodbath. "
"1868880","1875040"," Hopefully you can get the 3,800 after May 5th, like this is called May 5th, May 20th, May 30th."
"1875900","1882440"," This is kind of like the line in the sand for bears to say, hey, we're going low."
"1882600","1885760"," There's 3,600 over here, 3,800 over here. "
"1886180","1891300"," But even right now, into May 5th, my point here being, into May 5th, if we go up into May"
"1891300","1896080"," 5th and come back down and hold 4,000, it's not a good sign."
"1896340","1899580"," So we're going to pay attention and keep track of market breadth."
"1899580","1903140"," If market breadth is down, and the price matters here. "
"1903680","1909100"," If market breadth rolls over at some point in May 5th, we get way down here, and price is only"
"1909100","1910060"," at 4,000."
"1910760","1913700"," It's hard to make the case that we're getting the crash, right?"
"1914620","1924540"," If we're only halfway rolled over here, and price has come down significantly, like"
"1924540","1926620"," price has come, or breadth has only come this far."
"1926620","1929060"," And price has already down at 4,000. "
"1929200","1933400"," Yeah, I'll give you the 380 at that point, and we'll get that rolled down below that you're looking"
"1933400","1934100"," for as a bear."
"1934260","1941400"," But until that happens, in between now and the 5th, the move looks like it's up, and the pullback"
"1941400","1945800"," doesn't look as bad as bears are calling."
"1945800","1948060"," That 3600 starts to disappear. "
"1949680","1951560"," The 3600 ends up disappearing."
"1952340","1960100"," The idea of market, the market crashes on the books right now."
"1960220","1961520"," It's on the table right now. "
"1961660","1962840"," There's nothing saying market crash."
"1963740","1966980"," And you really have to, like bears have to break 4,000."
"1967520","1969060"," Number one for bears. "
"1969540","1972040"," You don't want to trade higher into FOMC."
"1972760","1974040"," Number two for bears."
"1974680","1982160"," If we squeeze higher, well, if we squeeze higher into FOMC, right, and then we start trading down,"
"1982520","1984900"," you have to get below 4,000 to break trend. "
"1985740","1987700"," You have to, you have to get below 4,000."
"1988260","1995440"," And then if you break below 4,000, you need to be watching market breadth and see where market"
"1995440","2001240"," breadth is for much lower lows."
"2003320","2005600"," Hold on, let me just show you guys something else here. "
"2010720","2013220"," We're going to look at the T3 really quickly, too."
"2013420","2014980"," I actually got a couple of things to show you here."
"2021160","2025100"," So right now, let me see if I can mute this or something. "
"2027760","2028600"," And over there."
"2029700","2036820"," Just right now, we're a little overbought in the daily, but not completely."
"2037680","2040760"," So this yellow box right here, this is the daily velocity. "
"2041020","2041180"," Okay."
"2042220","2044460"," And we're kind of there."
"2044800","2046300"," We're kind at the topping. "
"2046560","2050820"," We're at the topping part of, you're like, hold on a second here."
"2052620","2057739"," We're kind of at a topping pattern here, but not quite there yet."
"2058320","2059380"," Like we're there. "
"2059659","2060940"," See this yellow line right here?"
"2061400","2064659"," We're there, but not quite there yet."
"2065440","2066860"," So is it today?"
"2067620","2068560"," Is it tomorrow?"
"2069780","2072159"," Is it on the third?"
"2074060","2075900"," Is it on the fifth somewhere in there?"
"2076000","2076520"," You get what I'm saying?"
"2077159","2081159"," You have like two, three days stacked up here and then the decline starts to come into play."
"2081840","2085400"," So just be patient if you're a bear, but we're getting there. "
"2085940","2086860"," This is the hourly."
"2088500","2091580"," This is the hourly velocity down below right here."
"2091840","2092639"," It's green, right?"
"2093620","2095120"," And I want you to see this. "
"2095480","2097500"," The hourly velocity is coming back down."
"2098380","2100020"," We're starting to lose the hourly."
"2101220","2102740"," This isn't good for bulls. "
"2106640","2113740"," So at least for a bull or for a bear right now, it's more of a, in my view, either"
"2113740","2121660"," put on a call spread or put spread by some volatility by the VIX and just don't be buying calls"
"2121660","2122260"," on that shit."
"2122260","2126900"," It's like own the VIX and be done with it and come back and check later in the week or"
"2126900","2130780"," in two or three weeks to see if you get the rollover that you're looking for."
"2131480","2134120"," But there's something else showing up here on the chart. "
"2135560","2137540"," I want you to be looking out for."
"2138160","2143820"," So this is the spy right now, but it shows across the spy and it shows across."
"2145340","2167820"," It also shows across a little bit"
"2167820","2168560"," of a dump there. "
"2180670","2186090"," Okay, so another thing to be paying attention to here is any of you are wondering why the dip got"
"2186090","2189750"," bought earlier this week or last week on the hourly trigger."
"2191870","2194350"," Price is above the daily."
"2194810","2197290"," It's above the weekly and it's above the monthly right now. "
"2198150","2201070"," This is kind of a key thing for you to be paying attention to."
"2201070","2202470"," You want to pay attention to see this."
"2202870","2204870"," See this yellow line right here. "
"2205590","2209150"," And I want you to see the orange line right here."
"2209850","2213550"," And I want you to see the blue line right here."
"2213810","2223730"," And this is when you see the VIX being sold down to 17, 16, 15, 14, this is also being"
"2223730","2226730"," expressed in the stock and the actual S&P 500. "
"2227530","2232550"," You're seeing price above the daily, the weekly and the monthly trend."
"2233670","2236370"," And I'm going to lead into another conversation."
"2236670","2241730"," I want you to remember this because I'm going to show you velocity and higher time frames here in"
"2241730","2242230"," just a moment. "
"2242950","2248970"," And what is happening here is you're seeing the stock market trying to distance itself from"
"2248970","2251810"," volatility, even if it's only for a short amount of time."
"2251810","2254850"," Let's say it's to summer or fall or winter."
"2255390","2263550"," Outside of normally selling May or week, middle of like a moment of summer of weakness or the fall"
"2263550","2267450"," selling that we normally encounter in September, October times like that. "
"2268070","2274550"," The market itself, price is not below these three colored lines."
"2274550","2280790"," And I want to show you examples of this in the past and what the market is at least trying"
"2280790","2281810"," to do right now."
"2282430","2287130"," And I want you to remember the price above the yellow, the orange and the blue line. "
"2287850","2293530"," It's a return to some extent of a last volatile market."
"2293930","2297210"," You can see where it takes place in previous examples."
"2297890","2298890"," The market goes higher. "
"2299310","2302850"," We actually prices above the yellow, the orange and the blue."
"2302850","2308430"," Whenever the prices below the orange and yellow and blue, bad things tend to happen."
"2308850","2309550"," Really bad things. "
"2309810","2314790"," As a matter of fact, I put me to post, there were two instances this winter where it was very"
"2314790","2318190"," dangerous, where we were in some crash territory."
"2318750","2324570"," Price was below the blue, the yellow and the orange and there was high risk of the market crashing."
"2325470","2328370"," I'm going to assume at that point the Fed knew that. "
"2329010","2333310"," And I want you to see that as it expresses itself right now."
"2334650","2342770"," Right now, I want you to see this on the SP500 that currently the S&P 500 is attempting to"
"2342770","2344690"," separate itself."
"2344870","2348850"," You can see we tried this once before back in February. "
"2348850","2352430"," We're unsuccessful and we've been consolidating the entire way."
"2352970","2355310"," And the market is once again attempting this."
"2355310","2363430"," If you are a bear out there, you want to see price get below $3.98 on the SPY. "
"2363650","2370650"," $3.98, so that $4,000 area is crucial for bulls to hold $4,000."
"2370870","2374770"," Anything below that $4,000, you can at least start talking about $3,800."
"2375590","2378790"," I wouldn't be talking about $3,600, but I wouldn't be talking about $3,800. "
"2379550","2382050"," So that's kind of a key level here, $3.97 on the SPY."
"2382790","2385690"," And $4,000 on SPX."
"2386330","2387790"," And I'm going to show you one more thing. "
"2388050","2388410"," Oh, nice."
"2388910","2389830"," See that little rollover?"
"2390530","2392170"," Thankfully, did not buy that."
"2392670","2394950"," Let that market open wide up. "
"2404140","2405700"," I'm going to show you one more thing here."
"2405800","2406240"," Hold on here."
"2406620","2407300"," I'm moving forward here. "
"2414980","2415780"," Another timeframe."
"2416180","2416520"," There we go."
"2416700","2417100"," Crash predictor. "
"2418080","2419400"," I really have to crash predictor for the bears."
"2422580","2423580"," I'm going to crash predictor."
"2424820","2425980"," OK, crash predictor. "
"2429950","2431810"," Get your pen and paper out if you're a bear."
"2434230","2435750"," Get your pen and paper out."
"2435810","2436750"," I did a lot of work this week. "
"2437530","2438770"," Pen and paper if you're a bear."
"2440310","2442670"," I'm going to show you some of our worst crashes here."
"2445390","2447010"," It's a big one right there, right?"
"2447910","2449370"," This is 2008. "
"2450350","2453310"," If you're a bear out there, get your pencils out."
"2454290","2459330"," I think I was talking to somebody and I was like, yeah, I can probably give you the exact places"
"2459330","2461130"," where we're going to bottom."
"2461950","2463130"," This is an ugly one, 2008. "
"2463790","2464170"," Doozy."
"2464670","2465150"," Boom, boom, boom."
"2466010","2467450"," Blasted right through the white line. "
"2467690","2469590"," Went down to the gray line down here."
"2471110","2472250"," Not a good one, right?"
"2473330","2474710"," So just back over here."
"2475750","2478870"," I know that some of you bears out there like we're going to the depths of hell. "
"2478870","2480210"," I'm going to give you these three targets."
"2482490","2489520"," 2078.02. 27037."
"2492420","2493660"," Here's the COVID low. "
"2494300","2495980"," If you think it's worse than COVID, right?"
"2496220","2496860"," The COVID low."
"2499020","2503440"," Is 3335.37. OK, 33."
"2504520","2505520"," So it comes up, right?"
"2505760","2507220"," Remember when we're talking about 2,800?"
"2508140","2510260"," Then remember they're talking about 3,200?"
"2511080","2513680"," And I guarantee you now they're talking about 3,300. "
"2514180","2520520"," That's because the hedge funds use this calculation for when you hear like Mike Wilson, all those"
"2520520","2521940"," guys say, we're going to crash."
"2522700","2526220"," So down below 332865."
"2526700","2527660"," That's your updated number. "
"2528980","2531240"," That bears want to keep in mind."
"2531680","2539560"," Now with that said, with that said, what I do want to show you, is something that's important for"
"2539560","2541820"," you to take to pay attention to here, OK?"
"2542780","2545260"," I'm going to pay attention to this as I talked to you about this."
"2545440","2546420"," It's the crash predictor. "
"2546580","2547260"," I want to show you this."
"2549100","2551680"," I'm going to tag a line here for you."
"2551780","2552500"," See this right here?"
"2552780","2553680"," The top right there?"
"2554460","2555960"," I want to show you something here, OK?"
"2556960","2559740"," I want you to show you the top here. "
"2559940","2561460"," This is a weekly velocity."
"2561860","2564100"," I want you to show before we ever got to the top."
"2564820","2568640"," Here, you saw velocity declining on the weekly. "
"2570180","2574840"," On the monthly, we had a topping process here, and we began to decline, OK?"
"2576040","2581100"," We were starting to get really toppy here in the 3 month, and then we started to roll over here."
"2581400","2581900"," See that there?"
"2582680","2583800"," I want you to see that."
"2583960","2585100"," It's important for you to see that. "
"2586820","2588780"," OK, see that decline before it happened?"
"2588960","2589960"," Decline before it happened."
"2590960","2591980"," Decline before it happened."
"2591980","2596680"," We had some daily stuff here, but we want another decline on the daily. "
"2597360","2599000"," The decline on the daily?"
"2599320","2599560"," The weekly?"
"2600220","2601780"," The monthly in the 3 month?"
"2602520","2605460"," All predicting new lows in the S&P 500."
"2606680","2607580"," All bad."
"2608020","2614480"," When you have 4 velocities like this rolling over at the same time, and the accumulation has ended. "
"2615440","2620960"," Accumulation, accumulation, accumulation, accumulation all at the same time, then they've ended."
"2620960","2625300"," And now what you're seeing, though, is some kind of a flattening here."
"2629320","2631040"," And accumulation here. "
"2634800","2637480"," You're watching, this is bearish divergence here, right?"
"2637720","2639360"," The extreme bearishness down here."
"2640160","2641860"," Not so much of bearish anymore, right?"
"2642080","2642580"," Looks like accumulation."
"2644500","2646240"," And some accumulation here, right?"
"2646540","2648620"," It's not showing us crash right now. "
"2648620","2654220"," And I want you to pay attention to that because the expectation here is that you'll continue to see"
"2654220","2655500"," more accumulation."
"2656560","2658260"," You'll see more accumulation."
"2658920","2666660"," And then when we get up here at 50, when we get up here at 30 or 50, we begin"
"2666660","2670700"," to see a topping pattern here around 50. "
"2672100","2676620"," And as long as, even if we're going through daily cycles, this is why the daily was bought the"
"2676620","2677040"," other day."
"2678000","2679940"," Price should still go higher."
"2680160","2680720"," Does that make sense?"
"2681420","2688460"," And until we see that decline again, the decline in this velocity across the board, there is no"
"2688460","2690200"," prediction for a crash right now. "
"2690760","2697320"," So although you're like, hey, yeah, we're going down to 3300, my posit to you is that historically"
"2697320","2699260"," it's not showing that."
"2699400","2701260"," Historically, it's not showing that decline."
"2702580","2707840"," This crash predictor has a fairly good track, not fairly good. "
"2707980","2713320"," It has a beautiful track record of showing when we're topping out in the accumulation of the"
"2713320","2713640"," market."
"2714120","2716820"," So you'll hear on social media."
"2717400","2722540"," You'll hear people on social media say things like, you know, people on social media say things"
"2722540","2724060"," like, this is the dip to buy, by the way. "
"2725180","2729780"," You'll hear people on social media say things like, they'll say to you, they'll say, hey, look."
"2730540","2739940"," They'll say, when the market's going to crash, institutions will prop price up or they'll squeeze"
"2739940","2740640"," price higher."
"2741480","2745980"," And all along the way, they're divesting the market and they're just not telling you. "
"2746440","2748720"," And I saw a lot of that talk the last couple of weeks."
"2749940","2753680"," And I'm like, nah, I'm like, I just look back on all these different crashes."
"2753680","2755640"," I've looked back at every single one of them. "
"2756360","2761960"," And this crash predictor shows you when they are divesting in the background."
"2762400","2767620"," The only time that I've seen where it was hard to see, it was there, but it was hard to"
"2767620","2769160"," see, was the COVID crash."
"2769980","2775840"," COVID crash caught a lot of institutions off guard, not all of them, but a lot of them were along"
"2775840","2777520"," this market in the COVID crash. "
"2777520","2786900"," But every other one, going back to the 1920s, you could actually see in the background that act"
"2786900","2788980"," that you'll see in social media."
"2789100","2792700"," You'll see in the news, you'll see people saying, yeah, they're getting out of the market."
"2792840","2793600"," They're just not telling you. "
"2794940","2796580"," And so far right now, we're not seeing that."
"2796740","2799380"," So far right now, markets being bought by institutions."
"2800220","2807020"," I've saw an article again last week by Bloomberg saying it's retailers, small buyers, small"
"2807020","2807380"," investors. "
"2808000","2809520"," No, that's that's fucking hedge funds."
"2810240","2814240"," It was a very smart people that leave banks and that are putting that money into the market."
"2814380","2817600"," My view, at least, not my view, but I got the data to back it up. "
"2817800","2820980"," So just be aware of that."
"2821280","2826160"," As we move forward, that 3,300 is likely going to be where, where Mike Wilson, those kind of guys"
"2826160","2829360"," are going to call for that next 30, 20, 30%."
"2830540","2833040"," That's what that's what that's what he's talking about. "
"2837140","2840160"," And you can give me the other the other strikes for you to look at."
"2840640","2841840"," So below that."
"2843020","2845020"," I'll give you the exact numbers one more time. "
"2845800","2855660"," You've got 3331.89. This is current 2691.81 and then 2062 "
"2855660","2857360",".20. That's it."
"2857420","2857840"," You're awake."
"2858020","2858600"," Collapse bear. "
"2858840","2864380"," You're like, it's coming for crashing and then just circling back around."
"2864620","2867340"," I don't I think that I think they're fucking you over with that war shit."
"2877250","2878070"," You like that. "
"2878210","2879210"," I'll go make a face, right?"
"2882630","2884850"," So the state of the market."
"2885250","2887270"," Let's talk about the state of the market."
"2888170","2889970"," Your view will not your view. "
"2890110","2892390"," My view into the month of May."
"2893530","2895610"," Is I'm going to expect."
"2896630","2898270"," The market to. "
"2898850","2902730"," Be stabilized and possibly squeeze up."
"2902950","2905310"," Into FMC rate decision."
"2905750","2906930"," That's my posit. "
"2908430","2912290"," My next posit is we're likely going to sell."
"2912910","2916490"," Into let's call it the 21st or 23rd of May."
"2917290","2919510"," You're going to see a relief rally. "
"2920270","2921590"," Into June."
"2922530","2923370"," Beginning of June."
"2923790","2925590"," I'm sure bulls are going to get all pulled up. "
"2926430","2927810"," This is a shout out to Chase."
"2929330","2933750"," And then we're going to come out with the with the bullshit debt ceiling crisis."
"2934690","2936230"," Which is bullshit, but it doesn't matter. "
"2936370","2937850"," Even if it is bullshit, it doesn't matter."
"2938570","2941110"," And that'll give us our weakness into the beginning of June."
"2941210","2942690"," It'll catch bulls by their balls. "
"2948210","2949990"," Sorry, I'm laughing at all this shit."
"2953310","2954970"," Shouldn't be laughing at all this stuff."
"2955650","2959670"," And now let's look at VIX. "
"2959990","2962810"," Let's look at our our stepchild VIX."
"2963790","2966010"," VIX right now train train 15."
"2969470","2970930"," Sorry, I can't. "
"2972590","2975630"," VIX train VIX train like a redheaded stepchild."
"2976830","2980930"," It's trading $15.89. You already know what I want on VIX."
"2981650","2982830"," I've already told you I want. "
"2982950","2983890"," Wait a minute, I'm on the wrong VIX."
"2983930","2984710"," Am I on the wrong VIX there?"
"2986010","2988150"," I think I want like $14 in change."
"2989150","2991570"," I think I've said that $14 in change on the VIX. "
"2992090","2992830"," Let me see if we can."
"2995390","2996370"," Let's look at VXX."
"2998650","2999670"," No, not VX. "
"3003560","3004280"," Oh, man."
"3007140","3009100"," VXX can't destroy it right now."
"3010780","3012240"," VXX is like netty gas. "
"3014300","3015800"," That should all just tear you to pieces."
"3016860","3017680"," I don't know what's going on."
"3018140","3024020"," Somehow my drawings are gone on VIX. "
"3024140","3025100"," I charted this out."
"3025980","3027620"," Everyone was like, oh, it's gone back to March."
"3027820","3028700"," Now it's gone back to November. "
"3029040","3030080"," I'm like, nah, nah, nah, nah."
"3030140","3030600"," I'm looking for."
"3031080","3033560"," I was like, I'm looking for springtime 2021. "
"3034820","3036320"," That's what I was charting, actually."
"3037500","3040580"," Springtime 2021, the VIX Lowe's."
"3040800","3042520"," So I guess I'm gonna have to go back there and look again. "
"3044820","3046420"," 2021 VIX Lowe's."
"3046840","3048040"," Let's see if we can find it here."
"3048880","3050980"," There they are right there. "
"3051320","3051640"," Look at that."
"3052660","3053440"," What do we got here?"
"3053620","3053920"," 2021."
"3055180","3056220"," Well, we're almost there. "
"3057820","3059400"," They're like, yeah, but there were loads before that."
"3059500","3060320"," I'm like, nah, I don't care."
"3060580","3062680"," I'm looking for seasonality here in the VIX, baby. "
"3063420","3064580"," Yeah, right there."
"3065180","3065820"," 1503."
"3067960","3070200"," How about 1503?"
"3070860","3072580"," I'll take 1503. "
"3073220","3075980"," That was June 21."
"3078380","3079220"," Where's May?"
"3080460","3082820"," Damn, May, it's got destroyed."
"3084960","3085740"," We'll do some tag. "
"3085840","3087040"," We'll do some tagging down here."
"3089180","3091760"," There's an April 14, 2021."
"3093020","3094820"," Put some more lines in down there. "
"3096700","3099560"," Another one down there, 1502."
"3101440","3107400"," And a little low of $14.13. That's what I'm talking about right there."
"3116310","3117510"," May 27th. "
"3118510","3120530"," As a matter of fact, it's kind of fascinating."
"3122790","3123750"," Right in there."
"3128260","3129560"," Right in there. "
"3131820","3132600"," Second here."
"3133500","3134560"," One minute chart."
"3135920","3136580"," 30 minute chart. "
"3142240","3143360"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"3143720","3149720"," Get down there and just take out like $14.13, $15.02. Either way, look at this right now, like"
"3149720","3156280"," $14.13. $15.39. $15.02. Like you can just own the VIX."
"3157680","3160140"," And what's the dollar or two and own the VIX?"
"3160900","3163160"," You know, I'd buy a futures contract down the road. "
"3163340","3163500"," Like next."
"3164000","3168020"," Like don't be buying like some that's expiring soon."

"3200890","3202070"," Oh, doggy. "
"3203150","3204650"," Dude, what happened with sofai?"
"3207550","3209870"," Sofai was looking great, by the way."
"3212230","3213450"," Sofai was looking beautiful."
"3217350","3222350"," Sofai had a great squeeze off the hourly and hourly and a weekly trigger there. "
"3223330","3224450"," Sofai got destroyed."
"3224910","3225670"," What happened with sofai?"
"3226010","3226350"," Was there earnings?"
"3232350","3235510"," Trading for $16.76 right now."
"3236190","3236870"," I sound different. "
"3237410","3240790"," Yeah, I used to have a, or not used to, I have a sound mixer."
"3241210","3244930"," And I didn't realize that the all of the settings were released."
"3246230","3251970"," And so my sound mixer, I've been like, yeah, my sound mixer is working and my sound mixer hasn't"
"3251970","3252210"," been working. "
"3252210","3253310"," So now it's working."
"3256480","3256920"," Nice."
"3257260","3261540"," That $416.76. Nice range expansion. "
"3263580","3268720"," Let's look for the implied move for today."
"3268840","3269760"," We'll talk about that briefly."
"3270420","3271760"," So you guys get my gist here, right?"
"3271980","3272840"," Hopefully you get my gist. "
"3274440","3275980"," Hope you get my gist here."
"3275980","3278400"," Does it look like we're going to crash?"
"3279000","3279580"," Fuck no."
"3280540","3285320"," I looked on the, I looked on my, all the macro, I updated my all the macro. "
"3285560","3286020"," You need charts."
"3287620","3289180"," And then I, you know what I did?"
"3289320","3290360"," I'm not going to name names."
"3290680","3299040"," I don't, my, my, my YouTube doesn't show me other trading channels anymore. "
"3299380","3302040"," I don't know why that is, but it's not."
"3302900","3303820"," It's just not."
"3303940","3304460"," I don't know why. "
"3304460","3306900"," I don't know if I'm getting like banned or something."
"3307240","3309440"," So you have an implied move today of $418."
"3310680","3317680"," At least the options market is saying, expect a high of $418.10. That's right here. "
"3317820","3318980"," The option market is priced here."
"3320980","3322080"," Let's do implied move."
"3332850","3333810"," Well, options. "
"3334030","3337310"," Now, of course, we know the zero date market can fuck with this, right?"
"3337910","3340690"," We definitely know that the options are the zero date market."
"3340690","3343390"," This is, this is not account for the zero date market."
"3360070","3361090"," We're doing it again. "
"3361210","3361770"," Some walkiness."
"3362090","3362510"," Well, I'm here."
"3364490","3365050"," We. "
"3366330","3370750"," No, 417 88 for 1507."
"3382260","3383540"," For 15 11."
"3384660","3386380"," Now, don't hold me to these. "
"3387680","3389260"," For, for, for 15 11."
"3390320","3391160"," Right down in here."
"3392300","3393320"," Is the implied move. "
"3393460","3397740"," We know that the zero dates can, can move this shit up and down, up and down."
"3398020","3399200"," But this is basically what we're looking at today."
"3401100","3402220"," I watch this. "
"3402740","3408220"," So, I mean, some of these people out there in YouTube, man, they're like, um, they are fucking,"
"3410160","3411920"," they're, they're grasping at straws."
"3412920","3414200"," Like, I was watching one guy."
"3414300","3415060"," I'm not going to name names. "
"3415420","3416700"," And I actually like this guy."
"3418040","3421800"," But he made this video, I think Friday or Thursday or something."
"3421900","3422640"," It could have been over the weekend. "
"3422780","3423080"," I don't know."
"3423240","3424640"," It was some time I watched it."
"3424800","3426120"," I don't know when the video was published. "
"3426840","3429020"," But he was showing the yield curve inversion."
"3429500","3431980"," And I'm like, okay, I'm like, show me the fucking yield curve inversion."
"3434040","3438760"," And he showed it and he's like, he's like, he's like, the yield curve inversion is always right. "
"3439080","3439980"," He's like twos and tens."
"3440700","3442640"," They're always right every single time."
"3442700","3443580"," And I'm like, that's not true. "
"3444980","3445700"," Not true."
"3446680","3448060"," That is not fucking true."
"3448700","3449760"," But I'll let that slide. "
"3450180","3451220"," I was like, I'll let this slide."
"3451800","3453120"," I will let this slide."
"3455500","3457840"," So I'm like, okay, now show me the yield curve inversion. "
"3458220","3458780"," So he does."
"3458960","3460220"," He shows me the yield curve inversion."
"3460220","3460840"," Hold on a second here. "
"3461560","3463260"," He shows me the yield curve inversion."
"3463860","3465700"," I'm like, okay, show me that yield curve inversion."
"3466500","3472280"," But he's got the yield curve inversion on like a, like a fucking 50 here chart or something. "
"3472940","3474620"," It was like a weekly chart."
"3475200","3476720"," Like going back a hundred years."
"3476940","3478920"," And I was like, and then he's like pointing with his cursor. "
"3479180","3480080"," He's like, see right here?"
"3482180","3483720"," He's like, you see that right there?"
"3484080","3484340"," Crash."
"3484960","3485540"," See right there?"
"3485740","3485920"," Crash."
"3486760","3487440"," See right there?"
"3487700","3487900"," Crash. "
"3488500","3489780"," And I'm like, yeah, okay."
"3490820","3494460"," I'm like, spread that chart out a little bit against the SPX."
"3495700","3501400"," Because what it also shows is the SPX grinding higher for like a year or three years. "
"3503940","3508240"," I'm like, I'm like, you're acting like a fucking, you're acting like somebody who's got a million"
"3508240","3511100"," dollars or not a million, like six hundred million dollars."
"3511120","3513880"," And you got friends over at JPM."
"3514100","3515520"," They're going to hold that trade for you. "
"3515700","3516780"," It's like fucking Mike Barry."
"3517280","3519560"," Like you're going to hold that trade for the next three years."
"3520480","3521220"," Seven years. "
"3521540","3522620"," Market's going to grind higher."
"3522620","3524100"," And then you're going to eventually be right."
"3526080","3528900"," So that his positive is great. "
"3529180","3529800"," I agree with this positive."
"3529800","3531080"," I'm like, fuck yeah, I agree with that positive."
"3531440","3533220"," But then I'm like, yeah, there's so much with the shit at play. "
"3533980","3540580"," And then you're relating that to a spy chart or an SPX chart that's like a daily chart showing you"
"3540580","3541440"," the last six months."
"3543620","3545680"," I'm like, you can't really show a chart."
"3546860","3549140"," It's like 60 years. "
"3550080","3550960"," 30 years."
"3551820","3552720"," Fucking 40 years."
"3553640","3556000"," And then compare that against the daily chart and the S&P 500. "
"3556000","3558180"," Fucking S&P 500 got me hitting all time highs."
"3559180","3561860"," And then you'll get your yield curve version."
"3561860","3566500"," Matter of fact, part of the yield conversion has to do with the proxy wars were in. "
"3569810","3571030"," Like when does it happen?"
"3571590","3576150"," How important is that to you as a retail trader?"
"3577490","3578330"," Not so much."
"3579430","3580550"," Not so much."
"3583710","3585710"," And we can look at that chart if you want. "
"3585710","3587450"," I've got the yield curve version."
"3588310","3590430"," I've got all the macro you need chart back there."
"3590530","3591810"," We can take a look at if you want some new month. "
"3592270","3597690"," We can look at it, but it's saying the same thing like this market can easily grind higher sideways"
"3597690","3599070"," and higher for the next year."
"3599110","3604630"," It can do three years before you get that yield curve version that actually pays out for you."
"3605090","3607090"," That market crash that you're looking for. "
"3610710","3614930"," We know that the hourly is weak right now on the T3 chart."
"3617270","3618790"," I'm going to keep an eye on that in the background."
"3626760","3628220"," Early getting a little bit soft here. "
"3630760","3635620"," Early trigger is at 41412 to right where the screen bar is right here."
"3636940","3639980"," I told you earlier, that's what I wanted to buy at the open this morning."
"3639980","3643020"," When I came on with you, I said, I want to buy this down here if possible. "
"3648760","3649400"," So anyways."
"3653280","3656760"," You can't look at a like you can't look at like the curve version."
"3658460","3660420"," Raiding, especially if we're just pausing multiple. "
"3660560","3660940"," How about that?"
"3661040","3661260"," There are two."
"3663400","3668400"," The fed if they if you're a bull, you want to see a pause or a rate hike."
"3668780","3669560"," I'll be honest with you. "
"3669560","3671280"," If you're a bull, that's you want to see even if we're weak."
"3671880","3674740"," The market will continue to trade sideways and up."
"3675500","3677080"," You do not want to see rate cuts. "
"3677680","3679420"," In any way, shape or form."
"3679780","3682220"," If you see rate cuts, no bueno."
"3683140","3684700"," No, no bueno. "
"3685100","3686500"," You want to see the fed fighting inflation."
"3687940","3689500"," Even if they're really not fighting inflation."
"3690360","3693880"," And you want to see rates continue or even just a pause. "
"3694840","3697060"," You do not want to see rate cut."
"3697240","3697740"," You don't want to see."
"3698960","3700300"," You don't you don't want to hear. "
"3700900","3703660"," You don't want to hear thinking about thinking about rate cuts."
"3704260","3708240"," You don't want to hear like any notion of rate cut."
"3708380","3709560"," You don't want to hear the word whispered. "
"3711300","3715520"," And as a matter of fact, I'm not going to really think about talking about this stuff today but I"
"3715520","3715940"," don't think I am."
"3716020","3717300"," But anyways, is it the war stuff?"
"3718440","3719640"," There's like two instances."
"3722680","3723500"," There's two instances. "
"3725360","3728800"," Well, three instances where you don't want to hear a few things."
"3729020","3731100"," You're going to think, yeah, I want to hear this stuff, but you don't."
"3731780","3737440"," If you hear something like rate cut, you're likely going to see the market squeeze higher and then"
"3737440","3739120"," we're going to fucking bloodbath. "
"3739840","3740960"," You'll get to 3,300."
"3742280","3750040"," If you hear a truce in Ukraine, you'll likely see an initial face ripper."
"3751420","3758040"," But that could also turn into a any kind of truce would could ultimately turn into the market"
"3758040","3758780"," rolling over. "
"3759780","3767220"," And that would be where believe it or not war is even it's proxy war is giving us part of"
"3767220","3771020"," our soft landing."
"3772780","3779260"," It is competing against the recession showing its rearing its ugly face in our economy."
"3779460","3782980"," It's keeping people employed in the U.S. Believe it or not. "
"3783100","3783780"," It's keeping people at work."
"3784060","3784860"," It's keeping production up."
"3785820","3786540"," It's helping GDP. "
"3789140","3793040"," Giving away all of our old equipment and rebuilding and making new equipment."
"3793640","3796640"," Sending our warships around the world higher tempo."
"3798700","3802620"," The threat of war with Taiwan and China. "
"3803340","3807120"," You if those things weren't there if like Taiwan China wasn't there."
"3807200","3808180"," If Ukraine wasn't there."
"3810660","3812240"," That could be an issue. "
"3812240","3813640"," The market could crash on that."
"3813820","3814460"," Believe it or not."
"3814540","3816740"," I mean we could get the initial rip up but then you get the rollover. "
"3818120","3820640"," That stuff is most certainly helping with the soft landing."
"3821720","3824060"," So if you so keep those things in the back of your mind."
"3824460","3825260"," Keep the. "
"3826580","3828300"," Rank cuts in the back of your mind."
"3828300","3828780"," If you're a bull."
"3829460","3832940"," Those are like the three things on your mind is like do not cut rates. "
"3833500","3835040"," This sounds like really sure you say."
"3837320","3840380"," If you're a stock market bull you don't want to hear cuts."
"3840380","3843140"," You don't want to hear a truce and Ukraine is horrible. "
"3844040","3847380"," You don't want to see China US relations getting along just fine."
"3848000","3848700"," Not right now."
"3849760","3851680"," Not where the yield curve version is. "
"3852540","3853860"," And not where unemployment is."
"3854400","3855420"," All that kind of stuff."
"3855960","3856920"," You don't want to hear that stuff. "
"3857760","3860440"," If you see resolutions those three things in rate cuts."
"3861240","3861780"," Expect a bloodbath."
"3864240","3865460"," That terrible to say. "
"3866920","3867360"," Awful."
"3876500","3879140"," If you're putting money into the market."
"3879920","3882400"," I saw someone saying they're putting money into long term per port. "
"3882920","3886520"," You should be using a market breath for timing that kind of stuff."
"3887400","3890180"," When to put money into these tickers."
"3890360","3892080"," I think it's some tickers to go over today too. "
"3892700","3893620"," I was going to post some of these."
"3893900","3896180"," Some I posted on fin to it and others they didn't."
"3896180","3900740"," Because the others rely heavily upon market breath to enter them. "
"3901540","3904220"," But we will go we will go over some tickers later today."
"3904660","3906020"," Some tickers to look at."
"3907280","3908740"," For long term holdings. "
"3913340","3915680"," Arley still cooling off on the spy right now."
"3915680","3916600"," Arley's coming down."
"3916740","3917820"," I'll show you this in the background. "
"3918980","3919760"," Let's just see."
"3919860","3920780"," You can see it really quick."
"3921980","3924220"," You can this is the green boxes down here. "
"3924260","3924900"," This is the hourly."
"3927600","3928860"," Hoping Hoping Hoping Hoping."
"3930040","3931420"," We can cool off here. "
"3932160","3934980"," We can get price to get down below the one minute in the five minute."
"3935380","3938060"," Come back down here and just check this early."
"3938500","3939940"," Nice little dip by down here. "
"3940640","3941680"," Hoping we can get this out."
"3941840","3942280"," I don't know that we will."
"3943020","3944520"," However, it resolves itself. "
"3945460","3946800"," You can see we got on the hourly."
"3947060","3948880"," The hourly print just now is positive."
"3949780","3951700"," You can see this hourly print right now. "
"3951800","3952980"," We're at 10.30 in the morning."
"3952980","3955580"," We just got a positive print in the hourly."
"3956240","3958040"," My might get thwarted here. "
"3959360","3961080"," I might just get thwarted here."
"3961200","3962020"," It's going to one minute chart."
"3963600","3964740"," 15 minute chart. "
"3966600","3967660"," The one hour chart."
"3968300","3969220"," We want to buy that there."
"3969480","3973540"," We just got a positive print on the hourly chart. "
"3975240","3976900"," Not looking good for me to buy the dip."
"3981260","3983480"," I want to buy this right now to be honest with you."
"3991140","3995540"," Price still above the five minute 27 EMA. "
"4002430","4004830"," It's got a positive print on the hourly right now."
"4021080","4024840"," Yes, I'd say if you're a bear, I don't think it's bad to own the VIX."
"4026080","4028700"," I don't think it's a bad idea to own the VIX. "
"4030320","4031400"," Yeah, follow my cursor."
"4032160","4033040"," Hey, Johnny, good to see you, man."
"4038060","4039500"," No, I think you can buy. "
"4040560","4043940"," I think buying VIX or buying VXX is awesome, too."
"4045640","4048940"," I don't think options are good in VIX."
"4050160","4051780"," I fucking hate VIX options. "
"4052280","4053800"," VIX options are dead, man."
"4054680","4056820"," I'm sorry, like EVXY, all that shit."
"4057720","4058820"," I have no interest in it. "
"4059020","4062500"," But actually owning it, like the next contract, I think, is fine."
"4065260","4066060"," Owning VIX teachers."
"4066620","4067720"," I think I have no problem with that. "
"4068420","4069760"," I'm just holding on to the next few days."
"4074590","4076350"," But there's a stabilization of the markets."
"4076630","4078430"," I mean, I got to be honest with you guys. "
"4078770","4081210"," If you're a bear out there, you're going to have a sober look at yourself."
"4081730","4088550"," When we start trading $15, $14, $16, $17, it's the best tool."
"4089150","4094450"," If you're a retailer out there, investor, bear, sell side, one of the best tools you can be looking"
"4094450","4097250"," at is when the VIX is high, right?"
"4097430","4102569"," When the VIX is trading between $20 and $30, it's telling you, hey, we're elevated because of"
"4102569","4103649"," volatility in the market. "
"4104990","4110149"," When the VIX starts to reprice itself higher, it's telling you, right?"
"4110590","4111550"," Hey, we're going to $40."
"4111910","4112630"," Hey, we're going to $50."
"4115010","4116050"," I think the bottom is $30. "
"4117029","4119130"," It's telling you there's real risk in the market."
"4119649","4123130"," When the VIX starts to trade down below $20, it's telling you."
"4124950","4131050"," It's giving you a forward view saying, hey, we can have down weeks, and we can have down. "
"4131810","4133210"," We can get the VIX up to $25."
"4134350","4138590"," We can even have a one month out of three months where the VIX goes to $30."
"4139050","4144450"," But if the VIX is getting repriced down to $15, it's at least a caution to you if you're a"
"4144450","4144609"," bear. "
"4144609","4146830"," Like, hey, take a breather."
"4148529","4149430"," Sell the levels."
"4149870","4150990"," Don't be looking for the crash. "
"4151490","4152810"," Sell it to $4,000."
"4153069","4153970"," Sell it to $3,800."
"4155990","4159069"," Be measured in your response or be measured in your bearishness. "
"4160370","4165850"," If the VIX was $20 to $30, and I would say to you, yeah, fuck, yeah, you want to get"
"4165850","4166149"," out of $300?"
"4166470","4167490"," Fuck, yeah, it's happening."
"4167910","4170109"," It's a higher probability of it happening."
"4170790","4177729"," Well, the VIX is starting to get down below that $20, and it doesn't look good for the crash. "
"4179170","4180529"," Oh, snare at this point."
"4182310","4183529"," Let me take a trade here."
"4183710","4184270"," Hold on a second here. "
"4226990","4229290"," We got some 4.17s lined up."
"4230130","4230830"," They're 44 cents."
"4231050","4233470"," There's 170,000 contracts on them. "
"4238280","4247860"," We are bullish above $4.15.97. Five minutes right now confirming the move is higher, at least on"
"4247860","4248960"," the hourly trigger."
"4253690","4254890"," Above my Wilson promise."
"4269810","4272210"," Take a look at my own profile here. "
"4272310","4274490"," We're going to look at some stuff, some things that I posted this morning."
"4294610","4296370"," Yeah, so seasonality of gold."
"4296650","4297630"," I posted that chart. "
"4299030","4301130"," I posted the chart of gold."
"4301970","4304330"," It's with it this morning on fin to it."
"4304590","4312130"," It doesn't necessarily show a decline in gold, but it does show like a consolidation for gold. "
"4312550","4315610"," Can gold be positive in May and June?"
"4316230","4316390"," Yes."
"4317310","4320090"," It looks more like the sideways trade."
"4320910","4325870"," So if you are a gold bull, I'd be looking for September to be your big month. "
"4326650","4330830"," If you're looking, if you're still accumulating gold, you're going to look for that accumulation"
"4330830","4336030"," phase for the month of May and June for a September payout."
"4340290","4348470"," XLE posted that one this morning for you and it showed a strong start to May and XLE."
"4349550","4353630"," So if you are interested in XLE, I'm going to take a look at XLE real quick. "
"4353930","4354610"," We'll see what it's saying."
"4360280","4362400"," Had some weakness on the open this morning."
"4364340","4367360"," On a one hour chart, though, it's trying to resolve itself. "
"4369600","4374820"," One hour chart still trying to resolve itself, consolidate and consoling it a low two days ago on"
"4374820","4375120"," Thursday."
"4376360","4378200"," Of 80 to 70."
"4378620","4379780"," It was bought. "
"4379900","4381840"," It looks like it's being bought right now as well."
"4382900","4390220"," Now there was a big accumulation phase in XLE back in late March."
"4391960","4396980"," You can see that nice little bull flag on XLE and we'll take a look at it real quick. "
"4396980","4403980"," And I want to show you XLE in a 30 minute chart."
"4407560","4413680"," And I want you to see that XLE is on a one two, was it one?"
"4414960","4418540"," Two, three, four, five trigger cluster here."
"4418680","4421980"," So even though it's resolving itself right now, this is XLE. "
"4423460","4425400"," I'm looking for higher highs on it."
"4425400","4428500"," I'm looking to attack 86 30."
"4429480","4435520"," And then the highs again at 87 20 in the next five to 10 sessions. "
"4436260","4437640"," Five to 10 sessions."
"4440240","4442840"," Next five to 10 sessions on XLE."
"4443240","4445240"," The trade would be dead on XLE. "
"4449520","4453380"," If you start to see new lows on these previous lows here."
"4453860","4455020"," Right now we're not seeing those."
"4455460","4455620"," So. "
"4457640","4459380"," See all these dips be bought."
"4460840","4461940"," Dip was bought here."
"4462120","4462740"," Dip was bought here. "
"4462880","4465000"," Kip was bought here as long as this."
"4466080","4471000"," As this upward trend holds on XLE."
"4471400","4473140"," The move is higher. "
"4475160","4475680"," XLE."
"4476980","4480660"," And you could possibly look for some companies underneath."
"4486060","4490940"," I am long the spy along on 417 C's. "
"4491420","4492980"," So XLE just keep an eye on it."
"4493380","4495960"," It should do well in the beginning here of the month."
"4496740","4498860"," I like that it's on a five trigger cluster. "
"4500080","4505680"," You could if you're just own XLE, you could have you could just you could just make an alert on"
"4505680","4506220"," XLE."
"4507020","4508480"," The look at it right here."
"4508860","4509420"," So XLE. "
"4513160","4519360"," All you have to do is buy it and have a cell underneath."
"4521320","4522660"," This trend right here."
"4522740","4526140"," You can see this trend right here. "
"4526760","4528940"," You can actually set cell alerts underneath."
"4529700","4534640"," You see that you can actually sell to a cell create an alerts right on this plane here as long"
"4534640","4535600"," as this plane holds."
"4536300","4539400"," I'm going to expect XLE to go up into the next few sessions. "
"4539400","4542160"," At least you can decide what you're going to take for profit on that."
"4542860","4545100"," But I do like XLE beginning of the month."
"4560010","4561470"," I do like that it's on a cluster. "
"4565580","4567080"," Yeah, I think it's going to fucking explode."
"4567520","4568120"," Be honest with you."
"4568160","4569200"," I think it's going to explode higher. "
"4575810","4576610"," Paris at 24."
"4579070","4580810"," I think XLE is going to be the."
"4581170","4585290"," I think XLE is going to be like the one that like if there's something that's going to carry the"
"4585290","4586450"," spots, probably XLE. "
"4610000","4611940"," Also, I post them into it this morning."
"4614140","4618780"," I posted the they told me to inverse Kramer ETF."
"4619480","4621100"," That's been very nice to see. "
"4622980","4629220"," That in fact, so I have a friend I'm not going to name names, but I have a friend developer"
"4629220","4629660"," that."
"4630380","4637420"," Is working on Jim Kramer's has been working on Jim Kramer's call outs for the past five years or"
"4637420","4638200"," something 10 years."
"4638960","4643320"," And Jim Kramer actually all that like inverse Jim Kramer shit is is a crack of shit. "
"4643840","4647340"," And it's kind of nice to see the ETF is failing right now."
"4648100","4657820"," The ETF is any recommendation Jim Kramer gives the ETF opens a short position against his long"
"4657820","4658240"," positions."
"4659400","4661060"," And that ETF is failing right now. "
"4661380","4662220"," It's kind of nice to see."
"4663560","4669620"," And that was the same conclusion that this developed this dev collects data."
"4670260","4675860"," Oh, Jim Kramer is a matter of fact, or I should say that you'll actually see Jim Kramer's trades go"
"4675860","4676140"," up. "
"4676740","4679460"," And then over time, they do come down eventually."
"4679520","4684560"," You can't hold them to it to a call for multiple years on it or anything like that."
"4684560","4685140"," But he makes calls. "
"4685360","4690300"," Well, there's two two two points to understand about Jim Kramer to key point."
"4690440","4691280"," I'm not a fan of Jim Kramer."
"4691320","4692460"," I want to be clear on this. "
"4692940","4694300"," I'm not a Jim Kramer fan."
"4696140","4699700"," But I do want to make some points clear about Jim Kramer."
"4701140","4702860"," Number one, Jim Kramer. "
"4704160","4707340"," Is is probably the closest and this comes from this."
"4707460","4708580"," Now this part comes from Winky."
"4709620","4711000"," Oh, my lines came back. "
"4711280","4711640"," Awesome sauce."
"4712240","4714320"," I don't know why, but they just finally came back."
"4714440","4715100"," Okay, fine. "
"4717180","4718720"," Double bottom of the VIX right now."
"4719860","4722560"," Next target for VIX down below is 1476."
"4724520","4725620"," I do want to say something about Jim Kramer. "
"4726780","4729600"," Even though, like I'll be honest, let's start at the beginning."
"4730540","4739320"," I was in the market when Jim Kramer came on John Stewart show and apologized for leading retail"
"4739320","4740160"," stray."
"4743360","4745140"," And that enraged me. "
"4745440","4746320"," I didn't like Jim Kramer."
"4746820","4749660"," I was for many years, decades, right?"
"4750040","4750520"," I can hate him."
"4751140","4759120"," But I've had people over time make some points to me that I had to put some consideration in. "
"4759940","4761160"," Winky made a great point."
"4761480","4762180"," He said, you know what?"
"4762720","4765360"," For all the hell that Jim Kramer catches."
"4767120","4770240"," He's the closest thing that a retailer has. "
"4771120","4773240"," To being on their side."
"4774640","4777140"," Now the community argument made these not on your side."
"4777140","4777700"," I think it's paid. "
"4778380","4779640"," I have to fuck you over."
"4779920","4780660"," But let's be honest."
"4781060","4784880"," If there's anyone out there that's like got a show dedicated to you as the retailer. "
"4785480","4786540"," Probably fucking Jim Kramer."
"4787100","4791900"," I don't think it's really anybody else that's like, Hey, we're like, I'm going to talk about your"
"4791900","4792560"," favorite ticker."
"4793020","4798340"," I don't think there's any shows out there talking about your ship stock other than Jim Kramer. "
"4798760","4802280"," There's no one else you can call into and there's like a fucking millions of people watching."
"4803020","4804220"," So I got to give him that respect."
"4805560","4806420"," I do. "
"4806740","4807300"," It's deserved."
"4808020","4813700"," But the one that got my ass was when this developer was like, Oh, bro, I've been tracking Jim"
"4813700","4814360"," Kramer for years."
"4815480","4818100"," He's like, I've got all the data on Jim Kramer. "
"4818520","4819340"," I mean, all of it."
"4819340","4822420"," This guy's hella smart, like super fucking smart."
"4822680","4826020"," He's like, he's what if you if I showed you his resume. "
"4827020","4831500"," There aren't too many smarter than this guy, nor with the credentials of this guy."
"4831960","4835740"," And this guy was like, he's like, he's like, I want to tell you two things."
"4836680","4841820"," He's like, you'd be shocked at the number of tickers that that guy covers. "
"4846460","4847520"," He's like, he'd be shocked."
"4847840","4848860"," He's like, that guy goes over."
"4848860","4854200"," He's like, if you look at anyone else out there, any retailer, anybody on fin to it, anybody on"
"4854200","4858900"," CNBC, Fox News, Fox Business News, fucking Bloomberg, it doesn't matter. "
"4859380","4862760"," That fucking guy talks about tickers all the time."
"4865020","4871920"," And if you if you track every one of those tickers that he's made made predictions about."
"4872760","4873960"," He's fucking right. "
"4874240","4876720"," Most of the time, like 70% of the time."
"4877360","4878840"," It's like 70%."
"4878840","4880340"," And I was like, that's bullshit. "
"4880800","4881780"," He's like, let me show you the numbers."
"4882580","4885980"," So it was late night, of course, and he's showing me the numbers."
"4886040","4887720"," And I'm like, I'm like motherfucker. "
"4889300","4892920"," So why is all this inverse Jim Kramer shit?"
"4893060","4893740"," Where does that come from?"
"4895020","4895700"," And I got to be honest."
"4895980","4900220"," I think it comes from people getting fucked when Jim Kramer makes a call."
"4902060","4903960"," And he was a cacophony of it. "
"4903960","4906080"," I'm assuming it's just bad trading, bad investing."
"4907220","4908020"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"4908180","4908880"," Squeeze it up higher. "
"4909400","4912260"," Four 17 sees now trading 60 cents."
"4913340","4915200"," Thank you for flying with Captain Jim James Airlines."
"4916160","4919020"," Now trading 63 cents. "
"4923320","4927780"," New high on the spy trading 416 80 right now."
"4930560","4931120"," Yeah."
"4937020","4938980"," We want to break down right now. "
"4938980","4940140"," All the VIX, please."
"4943440","4947120"," Trading 416 89 on that trade right now."
"4947120","4948260"," That trading 60 cents. "
"4948360","4953140"," You can always take profit and get out of here if you want."
"4955980","4958040"," Jim Kramer actually does a good job."
"4958220","4961900"," And I was kind of fascinated with the inverse Kramer ETF because I'm like, this fucking thing is"
"4961900","4962460"," going to lose money. "
"4963440","4967160"," Well, this fuck, although they're not releasing what they short of his calls."
"4967420","4968960"," Like it's they're very vague on it."
"4969200","4970280"," They're even being vague. "
"4970280","4974640"," They're fucking losing, which is great because he's got a 70% win rate."
"4975000","4979720"," Now we're launching that tool that will show you that Jim Kramer is actually a great fucking"
"4979720","4979920"," trader."
"4980720","4986020"," It's kind of it's kind of bizarre to watch because I think it has more to do with like like"
"4986020","4989160"," a street cred thing for a retailer be like, yeah, fuck Jim Kramer. "
"4989160","4990100"," It's because it's cool."
"4990360","4992120"," It's like the most recent fad."
"4992500","4994740"," So I'm going to tell you in the background. "
"4995980","5000380"," Trading 416 89 right now."
"5005840","5010380"," Trading 64 cents on 417 C right now."
"5013300","5014820"," 64 cents. "
"5019380","5024820"," Getting all hot and steamy on the mic right now."
"5026380","5027300"," Hold on Becky."
"5034220","5038740"," I promised my girl, my girl Becky that I wouldn't swear on stream. "
"5040000","5040800"," Promise her."
"5040960","5042280"," So I'm just going to breathe deeply to you."
"5050350","5052430"," She keeps telling me not to curse anymore. "
"5052770","5056830"," So 416 89 right now."
"5057190","5059870"," 63 cents on 417 C."
"5062250","5067450"," New lows on the VIX, VIX trading $15 71 cents."
"5075140","5077860"," So he just takes them off right here and we're going to cut a little bit loose. "
"5082500","5083340"," A little bit."
"5083600","5087780"," Let some runners run trading 1571 on the VIX right now."
"5094960","5100600"," So anyways, inverse Jim Kramer, not in my view. "
"5101660","5103120"," I don't know what their mechanics are."
"5103260","5105220"," They won't release exactly what their mechanics are."
"5105320","5108040"," But even them not releasing their mechanics, they're fucking losing. "
"5108440","5109980"," It's got that fucking ETF is going to zero."
"5109980","5110780"," I guarantee it."
"5111260","5114720"," Over time, I want to make a statement here. "
"5115600","5120840"," That fucking inverse Kramer ETF is going to fucking zero."
"5122500","5126340"," If it doesn't go to zero, it's because they're not doing what they said they were going to do."
"5126960","5134440"," Now trading 416 89 65 cents on 417 66 cents. "
"5147680","5149520"," Taking a little bit more off the top right now."
"5153480","5155120"," That fucking ETF is going to zero."
"5155580","5158620"," I'm going to almost guarantee that they're going to change what the fuck they're doing. "
"5159240","5161540"," To keep that ETF alive, it's going to burn to zero."
"5162340","5167200"," Now the data, the matter of fact, you should just fucking short that ETF to the ground."
"5167980","5169420"," Now it might pop up again. "
"5170380","5173500"," It might pop up again when we fucking roll the market over for a minute."
"5173920","5175360"," But that ETF is going to burn."
"5176060","5176780"," Mark my words. "
"5179200","5181280"," Unless they run kind of some bullshit scam."
"5184340","5186880"," Like, you know, like, oh, we're shorting every ticker he calls out."
"5187140","5188460"," Well, we're not shorting those though. "
"5188460","5191480"," Something like that outside of that to keep the ETF alive."
"5192480","5195000"," They will lose and we're going to prove this too."
"5197200","5198340"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"5198840","5199640"," Oh, yeah."
"5200280","5202560"," What else did I call out this morning before the open?"
"5203340","5205980"," What else did I call out this morning before the open?"
"5206620","5207140"," Fubo."
"5208540","5211580"," Called out Fubo this morning. "
"5212680","5214420"," What's Fubo trading right now?"
"5215500","5221320"," $1.21. It's coming into its first resistance point right now if you're on that Fubo trade."
"5222220","5232180"," It's slamming into its hourly trigger at $1.21. If Fubo can stay above $1.21, its next"
"5232180","5233880"," target above is $2."
"5235240","5235740"," $2. "
"5236500","5244040"," It needs to, like right now it's just tagged the $1.21. So we'll see if it can consolidate and"
"5244040","5245000"," make a move higher."
"5245640","5246060"," Fubo."
"5247160","5248560"," Love taking time off. "
"5249300","5250500"," Love taking time off."
"5252120","5253440"," Fucking 100 for 100."
"5253960","5254460"," That's what happens. "
"5255640","5255900"," Oh!"
"5258040","5260260"," What's going on with Dash this morning?"
"5261060","5264620"," Dash with the five trigger cluster posted that two hours ago."
"5264940","5265060"," Dash."
"5265760","5266640"," What's Dash doing?"
"5266920","5268300"," What time did I post that Dash at?"
"5268300","5270760"," What time did I post that at?"
"5271000","5272800"," $7.55 this morning. "
"5279400","5281880"," $7.55 this morning."
"5283220","5285700"," And it's ripping fucking face off right now."
"5285780","5286640"," I don't know what else to say to you. "
"5287440","5288080"," Fubo."
"5288660","5288840"," Dash."
"5289800","5292160"," Both ripping faces off this morning. "
"5295210","5297850"," Ripping faces off this morning."
"5299590","5300430"," Not bad."
"5300750","5301270"," Doing pretty good here. "
"5302810","5304710"," Now we do have a problem here."
"5306130","5307950"," Goddamn A-E-S-I."
"5308590","5310270"," I like A-E-S-I. "
"5311510","5314470"," If you're going to buy that shit you got to hold it for a long time."
"5315210","5316730"," I'm not going to do any predictions on that one."
"5317710","5318610"," Let's just buy and hold. "
"5318810","5319890"," Come back and check on it later."
"5321130","5321470"," $20."
"5322630","5324290"," I can go to like 2021. "
"5325150","5326410"," 24 would be the excitement level."
"5328650","5330990"," Next one I talked about."
"5330990","5332690"," Natural gas, right?"
"5333470","5335570"," Is that so on?"
"5338690","5340950"," On A-E-S-I I said buy and hold. "
"5341530","5343010"," Just buy and don't fucking look at it."
"5344270","5347190"," My idea behind this trade too is multifold."
"5347530","5350150"," It provides a bunch of shit for these gas companies. "
"5351150","5352350"," That frack I know it's all bad."
"5353130","5355430"," But I think that it's going to live."
"5355570","5357450"," They just IPO'd as well. "
"5358970","5359970"," Everything's been positive."
"5359970","5362130"," I think they IPO'd at 18 bucks."
"5362310","5363510"," So that's what they're selling that shit for. "
"5363930","5366130"," It's a great round 18 bucks on a bad place to own it."
"5367010","5369430"," Anyways, do your due diligence A-E-S-I?"
"5370830","5375610"," The next question I asked was this morning was, are we coming into net gas season?"
"5376230","5383510"," So my idea here is, if we're coming into net gas season, ex-ali should perform."
"5385150","5394350"," I don't care about net gas, but I mostly care about the people that give the equipment and the"
"5394350","5404130"," materials note that company there, A-E-S-I provides the material used for fracking"
"5404130","5405250"," for gas. "
"5406470","5407670"," So I care more about that."
"5407950","5409810"," I'm assuming they're going to come and be like, yeah, fuck yeah."
"5409910","5414410"," These fucking guys are fracking their asses off and it's going to print spring and summer. "
"5414970","5421610"," Now, traditionally, natural gas starts to ramp up right now into summertime."
"5422870","5426230"," Now, there's two, like, buy seasons every year for net gas."
"5426650","5427810"," I'm going to look at that right now. "
"5428750","5430390"," And so I just posed that question."
"5431230","5433770"," I don't have a, I don't have a, yeah, net gas is going up."
"5434630","5437990"," I don't have a conviction on net gas coming into season. "
"5438490","5442050"," I have a conviction on net gas coming into season for the companies."
"5443390","5448230"," But I'm unsure on the price of net gas going up, but I do want to bring it up because"
"5450310","5453810"," seasonally we begin the buying season for net gas."
"5454190","5458930"," So maybe one of you guys out there knows more about than I do because I don't trade net gas"
"5458930","5459670"," like I used to. "
"5459830","5460750"," That was more of a question."
"5461110","5461870"," What do you guys think about?"
"5462410","5466290"," Is it better to invest in the companies for net gas?"
"5467290","5471030"," Is it time to buy net gas and just hold, buy and hold net gas?"
"5471570","5474950"," There was a bottoming that took place on the 26th of April."
"5476790","5479530"," And it seems like all these dips keep getting bought. "
"5480310","5482170"," So this is just somewhere I buy and I hold it."
"5482970","5485370"," Trading $6.83 right now."
"5486490","5490450"," 4.17 C trading 60 cents right now. "
"5491370","5493650"," I've got just another 30 or so kicking off here."
"5493870","5494910"," So I got 30 more contracts."
"5495410","5496510"," We'll see how long this holds up. "
"5497690","5499910"," And I'll cut loose as we get to that R1 above."
"5500350","5503950"," The implied move is that was added this morning was at 4.18 10."
"5504770","5507630"," That 4.17 C there's 150,000 contracts. "
"5508150","5509270"," It looks like there's more now."
"5510350","5513470"," Let's say there's now 183,000 trading 72 cents."
"5516050","5519290"," Right now with the big giant green fucking balls on spy. "
"5519870","5520510"," Welcome back motherfuckers."
"5522390","5523150"," Free money."
"5524170","5524850"," Kevin Jim James. "
"5530790","5532850"," Your hedge fund out there."
"5535030","5536150"," Day traders are back."
"5536590","5537230"," Did I feel offended?"
"5537790","5539950"," Like people on CNBC are like calling me out. "
"5540290","5542010"," I'm like, those motherfuckers are watching this show."
"5542730","5547690"," People on CNBC are like, there's some, there's like fucking five or 10 guys on fucking, on YouTube"
"5547690","5550190"," and Twitch and all they're doing is a trading the spy all day long."
"5550610","5551550"," That's PX the spy. "
"5552750","5554830"," Got like thousands of people trading the spy."
"5558850","5564550"," They're all pissed off because of trading the Azure date market for 17.05. Whenever we're at a"
"5564550","5567050"," round number, you should expect a reversal."
"5571820","5578000"," Taking 72 cents right now on 20 contracts and of 10 contracts left. "
"5580120","5587720"," Remember, we hit round numbers like 4.17, 4.18, 4.20. You'll see the algorithms do some natural"
"5587720","5588140"," selling."
"5592180","5593340"," 10 little ones left."
"5593340","5595340"," I want to see if we can get up here that are one at least. "
"5596040","5597860"," We could have a quick reversal here."
"5600420","5601320"," Do another check."
"5601580","5602440"," See if we can get up there. "
"5604460","5605360"," Something like that."
"5609200","5611320"," If I get burned on this one, I'm looking for."
"5613080","5616320"," The closing my trade if we trade below this white line right here. "
"5629460","5630420"," It's good to be back."
"5630440","5631600"," It's good to have vacation, man."
"5631760","5633160"," I feel fresh, baby. "
"5634860","5639580"," I was making money with Winky and Joe Donut last week."
"5640560","5642440"," Making phone calls with those guys."
"5643700","5644880"," Winky was getting hit. "
"5645060","5646320"," I was getting does taking hits."
"5646520","5647320"," Winky's taking hits."
"5648020","5649200"," Call these two guys. "
"5649380","5651060"," I'm like, today's a trend day."
"5654240","5656160"," I'm like, today's a trend day."
"5656160","5660720"," I wasn't doing that publicly, but I was doing it behind the scenes. "
"5660960","5662680"," Just so you guys know, I was I was trading last week."
"5662740","5663120"," Just not."
"5664720","5667040"," Just not with the streaming. "
"5667820","5668860"," Just for myself."
"5669320","5672480"," Trading 4.17.05 right now on the spy."
"5673340","5675020"," Let's hear the one minute chart real quick. "
"5676180","5677800"," One minute just blasting."
"5679360","5687260"," Last and higher looking to get up there and just tag that 4.17. We'll move the R1 over here."
"5689780","5696820"," I'm going to look for this 4.16.65 as a place to check where this yellow line is right"
"5696820","5697040"," here. "
"5700800","5705780"," If you're looking for a dip to buy, if you're not already in calls, you can just look down below"
"5705780","5706100"," here."
"5707080","5708540"," See if you can buy some down here."
"5709780","5711140"," If they even give you the time to. "
"5713860","5715920"," 4.17.07 right now."
"5716460","5731730"," 72 cents on 4.17.C. Oh,"
"5731810","5733150"," dude, FRC, I got fucked up."
"5733470","5734010"," I fucking. "
"5734790","5740090"," So I bought FRC at like 12 12 and change or something."
"5741250","5742390"," I didn't fuck up."
"5742530","5744770"," Well, I fucked up and I was like doing a rant stream. "
"5745690","5747130"," And I'm like, I'm on stream."
"5747130","5750550"," I'm like, I got to fucking close this thing out and I didn't close it."
"5750550","5752650"," It was like, it was like five minutes or something. "
"5752810","5755650"," It just fucking went to the depths of hell."
"5756750","5760510"," And so then I'm like, I'm going to buy FRC again, bought it at like six bucks."
"5760890","5761950"," And I still owned it. "
"5762530","5767630"," So I still owned 100 shares of FRC bought another 100 shares of FRC."
"5768470","5773110"," And then I put a stop loss underneath it and then it fucking sold off again on an open."
"5773650","5776670"," I think it was Thursday or Friday and I was triggered out. "
"5776850","5777910"," I was like, fuck this."
"5778350","5780970"," I was like, if we don't go straight up from here, I'm like, I'm fucking out of here."
"5781570","5782990"," I'm like, and I got, I got torched. "
"5783010","5787510"," It was only like, I think I made a loss 400 bucks or something total."
"5788650","5791470"," So it wasn't like I did a thousand shares or anything, only a hundred shares."
"5792610","5794390"," So it wasn't too bad, but I was pissed off. "
"5795010","5797050"," Like, I don't normally, my effect, I haven't even looked at it today."
"5797490","5802550"," I looked at it this morning, but I haven't looked at it since I got suspended this morning."
"5802730","5804330"," I'm fucking still under suspension. "
"5804330","5807610"," And you know what's fucked up about it?"
"5808230","5815850"," It is a winky, winky had made a comment, winky had made a comment where he had said, winky had"
"5815850","5819110"," made a comment where he said, we're riding higher right now trading 417-14."
"5820030","5829990"," We gave me a comment where he had said, winky said, he goes, he goes fucking JPM, wants to"
"5829990","5831850"," buy that fucking company for under a dollar."
"5831990","5833110"," That was like three weeks ago. "
"5833830","5835330"," I think it was like three or four weeks ago."
"5835690","5841550"," It was like, winky was like fucking, and then I read a story in New York."
"5841710","5843910"," It was a New Yorker magazine in New York Times or some shit. "
"5844570","5847450"," And they had like fucking Jamie meeting with Yellen."
"5847810","5854470"," Then he had a big dinner with a bunch of fucking, a bunch of money."
"5854770","5857810"," Like Bill Ackman was there, a bunch of shit. "
"5858090","5859070"," A bunch of people were there in the dinner."
"5859510","5861810"," And he's like trying to portray himself as a statesman."
"5862730","5864990"," You know what he was doing was backdoor dealing going. "
"5865630","5866890"," I'll take it for a dollar."
"5868010","5870610"," Fucking that's, and winky mentioned something about it."
"5870630","5872250"," And I'm fucking, that's what happened, right?"
"5872630","5873690"," You know that's what he's buying it for. "
"5874950","5884800"," Fucking dollar, 417-14 on a high just"
"5884800","5886160"," then trading 75 cents."
"5887520","5890100"," I'm almost ready to close out here and wrap it up."
"5891740","5894100"," New lows on the spy. "
"5898540","5900760"," Or not the spy, assuming Vix, my bad."
"5903440","5905820"," Vix just bloodbathing it right now."
"5907460","5910320"," Vix hasn't seen it alone like this in a long time. "
"5912400","5915360"," Big daddy's looking for Vix to trade to $14."
"5929390","5930330"," You remember that, winky?"
"5930730","5931430"," Remember that we were having that?"
"5931590","5934590"," We were talking about that for a few days, right?"
"5934810","5935130"," FRC."
"5936510","5937890"," And that's what happened, man. "
"5938650","5939650"," He fucking did it."
"5939810","5942470"," And then the bullshit articles that I was reading."
"5943530","5947230"," They're like, they're like, oh, you know, Jamie stepped up again. "
"5947230","5948730"," And I'm like, that's bullshit."
"5949690","5950790"," I'm like, they had the art."
"5950790","5955510"," They had the opinion pieces came out fucking months ago, a month ago, three weeks ago. "
"5955770","5957310"," That shit was planned out weeks ago."
"5958890","5960250"," Total fucking bullshit."
"5963450","5973200"," Yeah, 14, 75, 14, 11, roughly in there"
"5973200","5973940"," somewhere in there. "
"5977560","5984700"," We're trading $15.54. And I'll take 15, 14 and change, 14, 50."
"5984700","5992640"," The key point here, too, is even if it's for just a brief moment, if we trade above $4.20,"
"5993420","5996420"," it's a significant market."
"5997680","6002300"," $4.17 is now trading $0.55. I just have runners on right now. "
"6004580","6006940"," Reverse lawn $4.17, 14."
"6016130","6017790"," Hopefully you can get your dip buy down here."
"6018290","6024070"," One minute triggers down here on $4.16, 21. "
"6041660","6046840"," No, I think, yeah, I think that I think the idea here is what I don't like."
"6047120","6048440"," I mean, when I don't like options."
"6049480","6051480"," So what I don't like, I used to trade VIX options. "
"6052260","6056620"," I went through a phase of trying to time VIX options."
"6057260","6058240"," Leemmer, you phrase this."
"6059660","6060740"," I went through a period of like. "
"6061280","6062620"," I know we're at a top."
"6064060","6065960"," And I know that VIX is on a bottom."
"6066440","6067920"," I know that the market's on a top. "
"6068600","6070040"," I know that VIX is on a bottom."
"6070940","6073980"," So let's say I'm like, okay, fucking, I'm going to buy a weekly VIX."
"6074900","6080500"," I don't know, fucking buy like some VIX calls or UVXY calls. "
"6081780","6085280"," And they are 50 cents."
"6086880","6093100"," So I'd go in and buy those calls and market would squeeze up higher for a day or two."
"6093440","6096680"," And then it would roll over, start to make its way down. "
"6097280","6102180"," And then by the time that fucking call printed, it was like seven cents."
"6103160","6105120"," And I was like, fuck."
"6107360","6111000"," This has recently passed three to five years. "
"6111820","6117760"," So personally for me, I've had real like, not strokes of genius."
"6120100","6125180"," And when I have been successful trading VIX options, I'm talking about options here."
"6125900","6132820"," When I've been successful trading VIX options, it's mostly been like watching the VIX all day long. "
"6133160","6135380"," It's been like, you've got to like time it to the minute."
"6136340","6138540"," So for all that hard work, at least for me."
"6140320","6143240"," All that hard work doesn't pay out. "
"6144340","6149740"," Oh, there are some, there are some stack of, where are you?"
"6149740","6151100"," Who talked about that?"
"6152080","6152520"," Volwiz."
"6152840","6154360"," Let me see if we can find what Volwiz said."
"6159140","6160080"," Volwiz this week. "
"6160440","6162480"," If you don't know him, follow him on fin to it."
"6163060","6163760"," Volatility whiz."
"6165360","6166460"," I was going to say his name. "
"6166460","6167680"," I shouldn't say his name publicly."
"6167980","6168900"," And we'll stop his name."
"6170220","6171420"," Let me see what he wrote. "
"6180080","6181000"," He's just saying here."
"6200210","6204750"," He talked about, someone took us some VIX calls out."
"6206490","6207790"," Let's see where he wrote. "
"6208190","6209890"," He wrote a letter about this."
"6210090","6210270"," Hold on."
"6210850","6212350"," Let me just say it to me and find it. "
"6212350","6221020"," I think, though, that he didn't want to trade the VIX."
"6221160","6227020"," I think he wanted to trade put spreads or express it in a put spread trade."
"6230200","6235060"," Let's see if I can find this now. "
"6235260","6235420"," Hold on."
"6245810","6247230"," Just a second."
"6261940","6266560"," Yeah, so he made a point about, let me see if I can bring this up. "
"6267460","6268980"," Let me bring this up for you guys here."
"6269320","6270020"," Hold on here."
"6279150","6280990"," Let's just shout out to Volwiz. "
"6287040","6292600"," This is a trade that he was looking at."
"6292680","6293680"," Well, not the trade itself."
"6294420","6298280"," He was looking for insight in, how do I bring this?"
"6298420","6299640"," Let me make this larger here. "
"6301280","6303420"," He was bringing this up for you right now."
"6303480","6313170"," Someone was interested in the June 21st 26 C's."
"6313510","6315950"," June 21st 26 C."
"6316130","6318450"," There's a hundred thousand contracts here. "
"6320250","6322450"," He said, I'm going to quote him right now."
"6322450","6326970"," I said, someone is putting it all together and making a sizable trade on Vol returning."
"6328150","6330010"," No, it wasn't 50 Cent. "
"6331150","6331970"," That's kind of funny."
"6332550","6336150"," I don't know if you guys know that, but I don't remember."
"6336270","6337950"," I don't think that was COVID crash. "
"6338810","6340010"," You guys remember 50 Cent?"
"6340710","6342630"," It was like 50 Cent meme about VIX."
"6343410","6350630"," I think that was COVID, but his comment here was, someone's putting it all together and making a"
"6350630","6352250"," sizable trade on Vol utility returning."
"6352810","6354130"," No, it wasn't 50 Cent. "
"6354750","6358330"," I think Volwiz is implying you're not getting fucking 3300."
"6358770","6366270"," So you're not getting 50 VIX, but the infamous trader known for buying 50 Cent VIX options out of"
"6366270","6368150"," the money when Vol is low like it is today."
"6368930","6376590"," So he's saying this trader bought 26 Cent, I think there are 26, no 26 C's. "
"6379730","6381590"," They cost a fucking song."
"6383470","6386410"," I think the 36 Cent's could be wrong on that."
"6389610","6393790"," He's saying that the trader took down 100,000 contracts of June. "
"6394870","6397950"," 26 VIX calls for about $17 million."
"6399550","6403690"," This trader's simple equation equals treasury account equals zero."
"6404690","6408750"," Plus a current 16 sleepy VIX equals by Vol. "
"6410970","6413830"," So he's doing a low to zero cost put diagonals."
"6414770","6416670"," It'll benefit from an increase of Vol utility."
"6417650","6421130"," And other spreads like flies and calendars that are extremely cheap enough events looming. "
"6422730","6424150"," Let's just keep that on your radar."
"6426250","6428490"," June, what was that?"
"6428730","6431150"," June 26 June 21st."
"6439610","6442310"," Yeah, it's the guy that randomly shows up and buys 50 Cent contracts on VIX. "
"6449700","6451540"," VIX just out there swimming."
"6453780","6457700"," It's $15.64. My point here is this though."
"6458460","6459800"," You're going to buy some fucking VIX. "
"6460840","6461700"," Just own it."
"6462180","6463020"," Like own that shit."
"6464480","6468520"," Don't be buying weeklies on the VIX is my next point. "
"6469340","6471240"," Like June 21st, not so bad."
"6471240","6473180"," I don't mind June 21st, but me."
"6474020","6476040"," Of course I'm trading the VIX options. "
"6476340","6479940"," I'm like buying a fucking weekly on the VIX right now 50 cents."
"6482920","6483680"," Expecting the print."
"6483840","6484620"," I'm getting torched. "
"6484880","6489160"," So if you're going to get some VIX date those things out there farther in time."
"6490600","6491420"," And then."
"6494860","6495820"," Or just own it. "
"6496220","6498080"," You just own it and then sell it in the 20s."
"6500120","6503180"," You know $16 to $26."
"6503940","6505780"," It's a pretty good fucking trade, right?"
"6506720","6510360"," So if you just own the VIX at $16 and sell it $26, you're going to make money. "
"6516160","6517620"," I'll take a look at the one minute chart."
"6518680","6519820"," Oh, look at that."
"6519960","6522560"," Baby, come on down to $416.31, baby. "
"6523340","6525480"," We got to bearish cross right now."
"6525700","6526940"," Barrow plane to the downside."
"6527920","6530600"," Looking to tag $416.31 on the one minute chart. "
"6531300","6532420"," Five minute chart."
"6533320","6534620"," This is the yellow box."
"6534640","6535900"," If you're looking for a dip to buy. "
"6537120","6539800"," So we'll see how long this bearishness lasts."
"6541420","6542680"," On the 15 minute chart."
"6543500","6545400"," Same nicely reversal down below. "
"6545720","6547480"," Looking for this dip by down below here still."
"6549640","6552360"," Hourly chart still bullish right now."
"6553960","6556100"," For our chart still bullish. "
"6557380","6558780"," Daily chart still extremely bullish."
"6560700","6562780"," One minute chart trading below."
"6563600","6566020"," Trying to get that nice red bar down below here. "
"6566200","6566760"," Hold on a second here."
"6568860","6574800"," Looking for that tag down below here at $416.31. Nice bear cross right here."
"6576940","6578860"," Nice barrel plane right here. "
"6579780","6580780"," For the downside move."
"6585440","6587180"," Let's see if this holds here."
"6588880","6590400"," This is the five minute. "
"6592400","6594440"," It's $11.14 right now."
"6594980","6596720"," It's $11.14 in the morning."
"6605050","6606870"," I don't know if I call it crazy bearish divergence. "
"6606870","6613210"," I call it $1.5 in a bearish divergence or one minute bearish divergence."
"6614250","6615430"," I don't know that I call it crazy."
"6622090","6623390"," Nice tag down below. "
"6641410","6642450"," Maybe you're right."
"6642730","6643110"," Who said that?"
"6643110","6645150"," You might be right bro."
"6646810","6648250"," Let me have to take some puts here brother. "
"6650990","6651970"," Hold on here man."
"6655960","6657460"," I have to get some puts here brother."
"6663000","6666060"," I've still got a small position on 417 C."
"6668160","6671380"," I'm going to grab some puts to take the other side of this trade here. "
"6672620","6676960"," We have $4.15 down below."
"6694230","6696310"," I've got some 415 P's."
"6698410","6699950"," I've got a 4 today right now. "
"6700750","6710370"," I've got a cross building on spy."
"6710650","6711330"," I'm going to show it to you."
"6718640","6719760"," Right here. "
"6721080","6728070"," I want to see that right there."
"6729090","6730850"," And this right here in the background."
"6731310","6731590"," Oh shit. "
"6731830","6732710"," I've got to take some money here."
"6734370","6745600"," I sold 415 P for $0.41. Now"
"6745600","6748660"," there's a nice bearish cross starting to form right here."
"6753470","6756430"," We'll see if this will reject here and start to make its way lower. "
"6757390","6757830"," Right there."
"6762590","6763430"," There's a nice trade."
"6774700","6778680"," I'm going to try to re-enter 415 P in just a moment here. "
"6803900","6804380"," 7."
"6806200","6808300"," So we can turn this back to red here."
"6809560","6809960"," Yellow to red."
"6830480","6837320"," 415 is right now at $0.35. There are down at like $0.25 a little bit ago. "
"6838020","6839300"," So let's see if we can get them back down there again."
"6851240","6852340"," Yeah, I grabbed that first."
"6852620","6853400"," I grabbed that first. "
"6853680","6854900"," I missed this one right here."
"6856060","6857320"," But I grabbed this one right here."
"6857660","6858980"," This big bar is five minute bar. "
"6860440","6863100"," I caught a $0.42 or $0.41 on it."
"6863340","6868380"," Went from like $0.31 or $0.32 to $0.42. $0.25. Pretty good."
"6880480","6883640"," Nice, nice baro plane forming right now on the spy. "
"6888760","6890800"," I might just fucking enter and hold him."
"6898040","6899940"," Trading $0.35 right now."
"6907000","6908960"," I don't know if I'm going to get a better deal on him. "
"6914460","6922220"," Okay, I just bought 20 contracts on $0.35. 4.15 C or P, excuse me, and I'll add at"
"6922220","6927060"," $0.25. I'll start adding like 20 packs, 10 packs."
"6928460","6930420"," I just want a hand here."
"6932920","6937800"," I'm going to show it to you on this one right here. "
"6942950","6944370"," Here's where the cross is forming."
"6959170","6960970"," Is that 4.15 20?"
"6961430","6963070"," That's where the implied move is down below."
"6963310","6965730"," We'll see if we can get price to go lower. "
"6969640","6973440"," Still have like a small bunch of calls in there."
"6973880","6978700"," I'm going to try to close those out if we squeeze higher here briefly and try to close those out"
"6978700","6982260"," and stay long those puts down to this level down below here."
"6991020","6992800"," I'll add to the position up here. "
"6995340","6996740"," Leave this up here for a minute."
"7009410","7012550"," Just add another 20 at $0.29 on puts."
"7017070","7018530"," Let's see if we can get this cross. "
"7025230","7026990"," Still holding a small small."
"7036480","7038840"," It's actually what I bought into for the calls."
"7039160","7040100"," I'm going to sell the calls here. "
"7040820","7042440"," 4.17 C's."
"7042660","7047340"," I'm going to sell some flat on calls right now."
"7048200","7052700"," I am long on 40 contracts on 4.15 P's. "
"7065870","7067360"," All my phones are ringing right now."
"7079290","7090190"," 16.40. Someone stops up here somewhere for 16.40. See"
"7090190","7091650"," if you guys can follow along."
"7099460","7104060"," Price target down below somewhere in this 4.15 19 at least. "
"7104800","7106960"," 4.15 11 somewhere down in here."
"7114970","7118710"," Now trading 40 cents on 4.15 P's."
"7141920","7144280"," 2012 Benatose since 50. "
"7145840","7147060"," That's a nice boat."
"7154430","7156190"," That's a lot of money though man."
"7160090","7161650"," That's a lot of fucking money. "
"7161650","7163790"," I need a recession."
"7166670","7170630"," I need these fucking boat sellers to get hammered."
"7172110","7174190"," That's a great boat, that huge fucking boat. "
"7177010","7180470"," Yeah, trading 39 cents right now in 4.15 P."
"7180930","7181790"," It's going to be a quick bloodbath."
"7189640","7191900"," 41 cents right now in 4.15 P."
"7194820","7196240"," I'm glad I'm out of the calls now."
"7196300","7197420"," They went down to 29 cents. "
"7198780","7199420"," Come on baby."
"7203340","7205280"," They're going to get paid pretty big on this trade."
"7206520","7207660"," And this is going to be a big trade. "
"7212030","7215070"," I don't know, look at that fucking, look at those buyers down there dude."
"7215290","7216870"," That's my, this is my heat."
"7218070","7224050"," Like if you're selling the market here, it's like, look at this, look at this fucking, like watch"
"7224050","7225010"," my cursor over here. "
"7225190","7225590"," Like, look at this."
"7225710","7226850"," What is all that down there?"
"7227110","7227570"," Buyers?"
"7228470","7229950"," Buyers like, fuck you dude."
"7230250","7230850"," We ain't going down. "
"7236530","7239330"," 43, 44 cents on 4.15 P right now."
"7240690","7241430"," Come on baby."
"7241730","7242330"," Bloodbath of a minute. "
"7243330","7245710"," 46 cents on 4.15 P right now."
"7246630","7247550"," 47 cents."
"7252490","7253470"," There you go. "
"7253790","7254380"," There you go."
"7254380","7255180"," All right."
"7255880","7257640"," I am now out right now. "
"7258340","7260560"," I'm out at 47 cents flat."
"7272530","7274070"," I should have stayed in that trade."
"7275210","7276730"," They're now 50 cents. "
"7278890","7280490"," You need to get the bloodbath here."
"7283010","7286610"," This was the original one where I wanted to buy down here, but I don't know that we're going to"
"7286610","7287250"," get that, maybe."
"7293810","7294590"," Here's your pivot. "
"7296770","7299130"," The pre-market low is right here."
"7301610","7311140"," The applied move is 4.15.11. I'm flat right now."
"7311260","7311980"," I just took money and ran. "
"7313480","7314940"," This is a good trade right here."
"7315560","7317460"," I got in at 29 and 35."
"7318260","7319640"," Took this down into the 40s. "
"7320540","7321260"," 47, I think I got."
"7321920","7322340"," It's a good trade."
"7322760","7323640"," 25, 30%. "
"7329820","7330560"," There you go."
"7330560","7330960"," Bears want this."
"7331360","7332940"," Bears want to break this so bad. "
"7332940","7333420"," Look at them."
"7333820","7335020"," Look at bears like."
"7335420","7337640"," So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so. "
"7338200","7341720"," Fucking botly isn't fucking buyers everywhere down there."
"7350130","7351390"," Buyers like fuck you."
"7352470","7355030"," I have another quick bear flag right here. "
"7355830","7358470"," They wanted not bear flag, but a barrel plane."
"7360630","7361490"," I'll do yellow."
"7362350","7365130"," See if the bears can keep it going down here. "
"7372550","7373510"," Right there."
"7374790","7376230"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"7377190","7378470"," I don't know what the market is. "
"7378650","7380910"," I don't think it can do it."
"7381030","7386830"," I don't think the fucking options market is going to give like raining blood down here."
"7387130","7393590"," You might get this implied move down here, 4.15.19. We'll see. "
"7394030","7394770"," It's right here."
"7404120","7408400"," Yeah, there's a sell and may go away, but it normally doesn't."
"7408900","7410700"," So normally, so God, let's go back. "
"7411000","7412660"," So 2022."
"7415900","7416880"," So 2022."
"7417700","7422020"," So if you look at May, if you look at March and April. "
"7422720","7423680"," On average."
"7424700","7428780"," There are time for risk desks."
"7429160","7433220"," I made a post on this on Twitter and not many people picked up on it. "
"7433260","7434760"," Smart people are not smart."
"7434980","7435480"," I shouldn't say that."
"7436200","7442560"," It was a post that I made that was intended for professionals to know that I knew. "
"7446100","7451460"," And that was that risk desk for putting money into the market in."
"7453460","7454500"," October and then again."
"7456060","7457540"," In March and April. "
"7463460","7464640"," And so what that means is."
"7466980","7469620"," You know, you have a guy that's like, can I buy the market?"
"7469740","7470300"," Can I buy the market?"
"7470420","7471020"," Can I buy the market?"
"7472060","7473480"," And they weren't allowed to buy the market last year."
"7473600","7474960"," Well, this year, they are allowed to buy the market. "
"7475480","7477020"," They were told, yes, by the market."
"7477040","7477620"," So they did."
"7481000","7481300"," Now. "
"7482400","7483800"," They put that money in the market."
"7484480","7486880"," They don't put any more money in the market down the road."
"7489860","7491540"," They load the fuck up there. "
"7491660","7493160"," Well, they started in October."
"7493460","7495060"," Then they kept loading up the beginning of the year."
"7497560","7498000"," Now. "
"7499020","7499460"," 2022."
"7501300","7503280"," You got 2022."
"7503380","7506220"," You got a really bad, like you couldn't put risk on the market. "
"7506580","7507320"," Money on the sidelines."
"7508220","7508720"," Blah, blah, blah."
"7508720","7513680"," But if you look historically back in time. "
"7515820","7519160"," The terminology selling may go away."
"7520840","7522600"," Means that all the buying is done."
"7523920","7524780"," In May. "
"7527880","7533200"," So if you if you have if you have like a hey, we sell in May, normally."
"7534820","7537160"," Or normally we accumulate March and April."
"7537780","7539080"," And we sell in May. "
"7539800","7540920"," Then you look at."
"7543400","7544520"," Historical numbers."
"7544700","7546520"," Last year was an anomaly. "
"7547320","7550420"," It was not normal that we sold fucking January."
"7551020","7552780"," In February, March, April, right?"
"7553740","7554440"," It's kept selling, right?"
"7554720","7562700"," So it would tell you that the probability is that we're going to have a more normalized."
"7562700","7563860"," They year this year. "
"7563980","7566100"," Not guaranteed, but probable."
"7569520","7572680"," So if you're a bear and you're like, what does selling may mean?"
"7573380","7574780"," If they were buying May."
"7577320","7582920"," Normally we have to normally if we if we sell in May and go away, there's normally two cells. "
"7583340","7586560"," It's usually like the first five sessions or so."
"7586960","7588140"," It's not the first day."
"7588360","7589300"," It's not like me fucking first. "
"7589300","7589940"," You start selling."
"7590740","7592300"," You get like crazy, like sell, sell, sell."
"7592700","7595720"," Which means like first week, first five sessions, first five. "
"7595920","7601380"," From the first session, fifth session, somewhere in there, pick your fucking poison."
"7603720","7605320"," And fucking sell the market."
"7605780","7609720"," Now you have to be tempered in your expectations in this cell. "
"7610900","7612900"," We went over this this morning at the open was."
"7613720","7615500"," You do something that's kind of in the money."
"7616900","7617620"," We're trading. "
"7617840","7620580"," We were just trading for 17, 14."
"7622000","7625200"," So right where we are in the ballpark right here."
"7626300","7628920"," If you're going to put a short on the market. "
"7629980","7632400"," You don't put the short on the market like."
"7633280","7635540"," I don't fucking know."
"7636180","7641660"," It's selling May by 3600 P's for next week. "
"7642480","7644320"," It's not really the selling may go away."
"7644620","7645280"," It's more like."
"7646860","7649040"," As it for 17 or for 20. "
"7650720","7652960"," With 30 points away from for 20."
"7654100","7657560"," You know, you kind of want to go up there and see if we're going to reject our don'tcha."
"7658520","7662840"," You know that the algorithms are going to want to go up there likely and see if it holds or"
"7662840","7663140"," not. "
"7665580","7671140"," But we're at for 16 for 17 and you're like, I don't want to miss my chance to short the"
"7671140","7672020"," market for May."
"7672360","7673340"," Then I would say to you."
"7676260","7679660"," Do I think we'll be back and let's say we went to for 20 or for 30. "
"7680020","7681320"," I don't think we're going for 30."
"7681400","7683600"," I just think it's now."
"7685780","7690080"," Point two here is you could probably put some fucking put spread zone. "
"7691420","7693660"," For like, you know, and May."
"7694520","7695460"," And a June."
"7697580","7699660"," And we'll likely come back here at some point. "
"7700380","7701460"," We'll likely get."
"7703160","7704180"," Down to 4000."
"7706100","7707640"," That's some points in May. "
"7711180","7712160"," Maybe late May."
"7713160","7713960"," Third week of May."
"7714980","7717760"," There's someone out there saying we're going to 26 on VIX. "
"7719460","7721020"," June 26th or first or something."
"7721740","7722280"," Probably not."
"7722440","7723400"," They probably thinks we're doing it in May. "
"7724320","7725420"," Or first week of June."
"7725840","7726240"," So you like."
"7726880","7728720"," So you started thinking about it and you're like, yeah, okay. "
"7729500","7730820"," I need some help."
"7731200","7732420"," I'm a bear and you need some help."
"7733260","7734580"," To make think of yourself. "
"7734860","7735920"," Yeah, I'll get something for."
"7736680","7738420"," I don't know, me and a may."
"7739180","7740500"," Then you need some help, right?"
"7743820","7746120"," We gave you those events earlier, right?"
"7746740","7749000"," Those volatile events are going to help you along the way. "
"7749540","7752480"," You want to have some probability on your side."
"7753860","7754680"," That those are going to print."
"7757020","7758920"," So you've got FOMC. "
"7759360","7763300"," You likely won't see volatility until the FOMC meeting, but that could help you."
"7766460","7767000"," Let's say."
"7768100","7769080"," It doesn't help. "
"7771060","7772020"," Let's think this through."
"7772720","7773600"," Let's say you're a bear."
"7774060","7775160"," I don't know why I help bears out. "
"7775520","7776320"," Fucking hate help bears."
"7776660","7777300"," I was fucking."
"7777700","7779060"," I'm finned to him. "
"7779620","7782080"," They think I hate bears think I hate him and finned to it."
"7783160","7784020"," But I don't."
"7785760","7786980"," So let's say you're a bear. "
"7788940","7791000"," You want to have probability on your side."
"7793060","7794620"," Like what could."
"7795940","7797320"," Prints my put spreads. "
"7798820","7800900"," So you're like all captain."
"7801980","7807260"," You're like captain."
"7808280","7810140"," We've got FOMC rate decision. "
"7810400","7811020"," That's going to do it."
"7811500","7812680"," Let's go into the rate decision."
"7813400","7815800"," And we're barely weak. "
"7815800","7818880"," And then he says some stupid shit that makes the market go to the moon."
"7820440","7821780"," You kind of fucked, right?"
"7825520","7830480"," Then you have your your monthly OPEC's weakness that comes into play for."
"7831940","7833320"," Third week in May, right?"
"7834480","7840500"," So if you're going to buy some put spreads and you're just using just a Fed meeting. "
"7840860","7842520"," Or rate decision as your."
"7844480","7845640"," Hey, this is going to print."
"7846160","7847120"," You got fucked. "
"7848600","7851700"," If you at least if you put more time on it, you could be like, yeah, okay, third week of"
"7851700","7851840"," May."
"7852280","7854300"," When these fucking put spreads, they're dogging."
"7854880","7856140"," They're fucking beat the shit. "
"7856940","7859040"," I got fucked over by Jerome Powell."
"7863040","7865300"," What else do I have to make these fucking things print?"
"7866340","7869080"," You got PCE inflation shit."
"7869880","7870320"," How am I printed?"
"7871540","7872520"," You got NFP. "
"7873180","7873880"," I could print it."
"7874600","7875680"," And you got CPI."
"7877400","7878380"," That could print it. "
"7879140","7880940"," Hey, those things don't fucking print it."
"7881540","7883220"," You're just getting fucking hammered now, right?"
"7883620","7888360"," You're like, oh man, cap said sell in May, but we're not like, we're only down to 4,000 and"
"7888360","7889080"," need these fucking things."
"7889240","7890060"," I need to print 3,800. "
"7892760","7894360"," Because you're overly bearish, right?"
"7895820","7898480"," So your last thing that you could have would be the debt ceiling."
"7899460","7901260"," You know, they're going to pull some of that bullshit."
"7902200","7903500"," One way or another, right?"
"7903880","7906400"," If they don't pull it, sell side will pull it. "
"7907200","7908580"," And they're positioned for it will pull it."
"7909000","7914120"," So I guess the point here is, trading 417, 416."
"7917340","7922860"," If you're a bear instead of looking at the market like, the market will burn during FMC. "
"7923600","7930380"," The market will burn during PCE inflation shit and NFP and CPI."
"7933320","7935560"," You should probably add in the debt ceiling."
"7937860","7941760"," So you can be like, you know what, one of these fucking things is going to go my way. "
"7944200","7946780"," And I'm going to put some time on some put spreads."
"7947020","7948820"," I'm going to put them a little bit more on the money."
"7950080","7954740"," So even if the shit doesn't go my way, at least get four or five chances to be right. "
"7956220","7956860"," Look at that."
"7956920","7959180"," That fucking dips being bought fucking disgusting."
"7962240","7963620"," I'm flat right now, by the way. "
"7963700","7965580"," I want to buy this really bad right here."
"7965740","7966720"," Be honest with you."
"7967000","7968300"," I'm about to fuck out of that. "
"7969580","7970980"," I'm not in flat right now."
"7974420","7980340"," The point to if you're a bear is, I would temper my expectations."
"7983200","7984980"," I would, I would say. "
"7986280","7987520"," So I was looking at this earlier."
"7987740","7988300"," I'm going to look at this again."
"7988300","7989220"," Let's look at this. "
"7989340","7989860"," Let's look at this."
"7991160","7992660"," Look at this chart real real."
"7992860","7993640"," Oh, it's my second here. "
"8003240","8005680"," Like these zigzag channels that I have."
"8005700","8007240"," Where are those zigzag channels that I have?"
"8010970","8012450"," There we go."
"8024670","8025070"," Yeah. "
"8025230","8028950"," So staying in channel in June puts us at 420 Jesus."
"8033530","8034330"," Man, dude."
"8035370","8035770"," Brutal. "
"8035890","8036630"," I'm looking at it right now."
"8036630","8037130"," I'm like June."
"8037610","8039170"," We could easily be a June at 420. "
"8046330","8046730"," Easily."
"8047930","8054210"," So my point here would be like some June in the money put spreads."
"8054810","8055430"," They're kind of nice. "
"8058070","8059790"," June 21st in the money put spreads."
"8061250","8062070"," Something like that."
"8062870","8064050"," Down to 4,000 maybe. "
"8066390","8067810"," Like 417 to 4,000."
"8068330","8068950"," How much does cost?"
"8069250","8069630"," Let's look at them."
"8069630","8071050"," See what they pay. "
"8077160","8078280"," We can get a better deal."
"8093260","8095140"," Is there anything dirt cheap?"
"8097500","8099180"," Trades by marsh."
"8101740","8103420"," This is going to fuel move higher in the market. "
"8103580","8104300"," I know that for sure."
"8107720","8110680"," June 16th, June 30th."
"8111820","8112620"," June 30th. "
"8114440","8115220"," Generate trades."
"8116700","8118500"," I'm going to put spread."
"8119840","8123290"," I'm looking for here. "
"8127670","8128530"," 399416."
"8130050","8131490"," It's actually not bad."
"8132650","8133490"," It's fucking a great trade. "
"8137210","8138470"," 420."
"8138830","8139450"," Nope."
"8141490","8142230"," 420. "
"8157650","8158280"," Save."
"8159400","8160780"," Then 4,400."
"8162960","8163100"," Save. "
"8165540","8167920"," So June 30th."
"8170470","8172460"," June 30th, 4,000."
"8172880","8174560"," Oh, the 420 pay. "
"8180920","8182900"," Yeah, pays 200 bucks."
"8183080","8183780"," That's not that much."
"8184140","8185460"," Needs to get below. "
"8186100","8195889"," I don't know if I like that trade."
"8206549","8207549"," It says."
"8210250","8214549"," It's $415 for $1284. "
"8217889","8218809"," It's okay."
"8224750","8227090"," Yes, September is not very expensive either."
"8230309","8231650"," Yeah, I like the June trade. "
"8232030","8234570"," I don't know what I don't like about this trade."
"8236490","8240330"," Is that I have to get below 4,000?"
"8244150","8246070"," I need to get below 4,000."
"8249690","8251490"," Or 400 on spy. "
"8252650","8254770"," Let me look at Spy real quick here."
"8256770","8260250"," Yeah, there's this gap down here that needs filled."
"8264190","8266150"," Erase all this nonsense down here. "
"8266730","8269410"," Oh, that's a tough one."
"8270030","8272410"," This is all late pyres back here."
"8273250","8274450"," This is, uh, yeah. "
"8275110","8276129"," Yeah, I think we could do it."
"8279209","8280250"," I think we can do that."
"8287860","8288660"," So there it is. "
"8288860","8290959"," That's my trade for June."
"8290959","8294799"," I said $3.99, but it has to be $400."
"8295360","8296940"," I don't like $3.99. I want $400. "
"8299559","8300559"," It's a four."
"8300799","8302459"," It's a put spread."
"8303139","8304459"," June 30th. "
"8307719","8312719"," June 30th, $404.16. Put spread."
"8314160","8316260"," Cos four in a box pays $1200."
"8317980","8318820"," It's not bad. "
"8319600","8320840"," You don't need it all either."
"8323100","8325379"," You don't need the, you know, a matter of fact, it starts bleeding."
"8326160","8329920"," You can just cut the, uh, the, the sold put side. "
"8335250","8336830"," And just re, just ring the register."
"8338790","8343170"," Or, you know, you could do is hold, you could close the, if we get down there to 400, I"
"8343170","8345309"," would close the, uh, the bot put side."
"8346370","8349750"," And then it would hold that fucking 416 into, uh, end of June. "
"8350969","8352209"," It rips faces higher."
"8352389","8354129"," You'll make a bunch of bank on both sides of that trade."
"8357590","8358330"," It's a good trade. "
"8359209","8360709"," It's a good trade if you can manage it."
"8365450","8367570"," One minute charts still bearish right now."
"8368250","8369530"," Let's check the five minute chart. "
"8373480","8375280"," Five minutes looking for a reversal here."
"8375780","8378280"," To the downside, I want you to see the plane as it's forming."
"8378900","8379540"," It's right here. "
"8379700","8384139"," There's that white line and that yellow line looking for another reversal lower here."
"8386510","8388760"," You can see the buyers are still stepping in."
"8391000","8392440"," I'm flat right now. "
"8393820","8395680"," Let me look on spy real quick."
"8396080","8396900"," Just check a."
"8398900","8400920"," A T three tool here and see."
"8402300","8403140"," It's saying. "
"8411730","8415270"," Oof, bears getting squeezed right now."
"8428490","8429650"," Bears getting squeezed."
"8442530","8444030"," Bears want to hold this right here. "
"8444130","8444670"," This red line."
"8468790","8469690"," They're right there."
"8480480","8481980"," Should see a big squeeze here. "
"8486490","8487470"," Looks bearish still."
"8487630","8488490"," Oh, he's on T three."
"8488570","8489150"," It looks bearish. "
"8490870","8492470"," I don't want to trade this at all."
"8496870","8500250"," Tomorrow we've got US job openings at 10 a.m. factory orders at 10."
"8501470","8502030"," Wednesday. "

"8532460","8532840"," Make a note."

"8715180","8716780"," So this morning I woke up."
"8717920","8722720"," And I went to go do my workout and I didn't drink coffee. "
"8724380","8728660"," Just woke up and I did my bike ride and I did my weight training."
"8732120","8738960"," And it took 10 minutes, maybe 15 to get into the workout."
"8739200","8747240"," I felt really tired and didn't feel good for the first 10, 15 minutes. "
"8748520","8754440"," And then when I was done with the workout, I wanted to go back to sleep."
"8755520","8756400"," I wanted to take a nap."
"8756400","8758180"," I wasn't feeling it. "
"8758340","8758980"," I didn't."
"8759060","8761120"," I went and had coffee and took a shower and all that."
"8764680","8771240"," But do any of you work out in the morning and do you drink coffee or tea first or do"
"8771240","8772040"," you not?"
"8781280","8781960"," Low carbs. "
"8783140","8783720"," I didn't eat."
"8783900","8784640"," Oh, you know what I did?"
"8784760","8785700"," I did have a bowl of cereal."
"8787640","8788280"," I did. "
"8788280","8793300"," I had some like oatmeal cereal like an hour or two before I worked out."
"8793760","8794900"," I forgot about that."
"8795140","8796200"," Fuck, that might have been it. "
"8797020","8797660"," That could have been it."
"8802020","8805540"," That could be the problem that I forgot that I, you know what I did?"
"8805660","8809540"," I got a bowl of cereal at like five o'clock in the morning or something."
"8809840","8810200"," Like seven. "
"8811440","8814500"," I did the workout and I wasn't fucking feeling it."
"8814600","8815840"," I had no coffee at that point."
"8815940","8817120"," I was just pounding water all morning. "
"8817120","8820800"," I did have some like old crunch shit."
"8825470","8826530"," Yeah, I didn't drink anything."
"8826890","8829210"," I had just water, just like two big cups of water. "
"8829390","8834710"," My kids have these big plastic cups that pound two of those and then normally I don't have"
"8834710","8834990"," breakfast."
"8835530","8837530"," I did have a fucking bowl of cereal this morning."
"8842950","8844190"," That's what it was, wasn't it?"
"8847690","8848790"," I didn't even think of that. "
"8849090","8850310"," Forget I even asked the stupid question."
"8850910","8852310"," It has to be that."
"8853230","8855050"," Normally though, I thought it was protein that. "
"8856370","8857490"," I thought it was like protein."
"8857870","8860610"," I don't like carbs when I'm working out or like hiking or biking."
"8860610","8863670"," That shit seems to be fine because it's harder to digest protein. "
"8864670","8866210"," Or at least in my experience, it has been."
"8867150","8868930"," I probably shouldn't have that bowl of fucking cereal."
"8869090","8869810"," That must have been what it was. "
"8870510","8873250"," It was like 10 minutes of like dragging ass."
"8874170","8876950"," And I finally got into it and I'm like, okay, I'll do another 20."
"8878930","8882710"," And then when I was done, I was like, I was like, I could just fucking, I could like just"
"8882710","8883970"," go right to sleep right now. "
"8885650","8886950"," Probably fucking go to sleep."
"8887450","8888970"," I shouldn't say that, but."
"8891230","8893070"," I was like, it's totally sleeping right now. "
"8893070","8895130"," It was like, it was, it was like taking a."
"8896790","8897790"," What do you call a pill?"
"8899270","8900210"," Like one of those."
"8902170","8905130"," When you have allergies, like allergy medication, that shit."
"8905310","8906030"," I'm out like. "
"8907490","8909590"," Like, you know, like some people like doesn't phase me."
"8909590","8912030"," Some people are like, I'll go to sleep and wake up and be fine."
"8912070","8915110"," If I take an allergy pill, like 24 hours later, I'm fine. "
"8918630","8919550"," It's like a butter."
"8922670","8923970"," Monster ultra zero."
"8924890","8925290"," Jesus. "
"8926330","8928130"," What are you guys doing out there?"
"8929950","8931970"," Yeah, it has to be the, it has to be the cereal."
"8932490","8933790"," It has to be the carbs from the cereal."
"8938730","8939090"," Nice. "
"8939290","8940030"," You know what I did do?"
"8940330","8941570"," I was, I talked about my, my rant."
"8942170","8947050"," So like Thursday or something of last week or the week before, not this past week."
"8947550","8950810"," So the week that I took off was like, so Thursday, I went golfing. "
"8951590","8955510"," And then I've had this big meeting and then it's like, I ended up having to do another meeting on"
"8955510","8955790"," Friday."
"8956630","8958210"," And I'm like, I got so much shit going on."
"8958270","8959450"," I'm like, just we're starting vacation. "
"8960370","8961610"," So I'm like, fuck this, right?"
"8962230","8966490"," So I went to the, I was in a country club and I was in this like really nice place."
"8967350","8970850"," And they had expensive ass like old weller."
"8971370","8974010"," Basically, they didn't have Pappy, but they had weller. "
"8974150","8976090"," That was like the old shit that was expensive."
"8977530","8979990"," His fucking bears are losing control right now."
"8981370","8983730"," Bears lose control in the market right now. "
"8984910","8989470"," So I fucking, so the attorney and I are friends and I'm just pounding whiskeys with them."
"8992690","8994550"," Bears losing control right now."
"8998570","9000070"," And so I kept drinking. "
"9001670","9002430"," Wasn't driving."
"9002670","9003350"," Was like, fuck it."
"9003990","9006550"," And like good day golfing, sunny outside. "
"9007050","9009810"," But by the fact, it's like 45 degrees here where I live right now."
"9010550","9016330"," All right, this year, this year has been gray skies every fucking day, like 80% of the year."
"9017010","9018250"," This spring, we haven't had one. "
"9018250","9018950"," It's been winter."
"9020090","9023090"," Every once in a while, I get a sunny day, like once every two weeks."
"9024050","9029630"," So, of course, I'm like enjoying myself and I take a boner pill and I've been drinking. "
"9031310","9034750"," So this, I used to, of course, I'm not eligible to take boner pills."
"9035950","9037450"," I shouldn't say this, probably get arrested for this."
"9038010","9044990"," So I go on to the internet and I pay like an internet doctor and I'm like, I'm like check"
"9044990","9045250"," mark. "
"9045270","9046270"," I'm like, yeah, I can't breathe."

"9051470","9052350"," Like I'm dying over here. "
"9052890","9055030"," My penis is small all the time."
"9056470","9058050"," They answer all the questions and shit."
"9058190","9058710"," It's a questionnaire. "
"9059410","9060370"," You actually have to see a doctor."
"9061470","9066350"," And then they just send you a prescription to your favorite prescriber."
"9067350","9069070"," So I got to the first time I got this stuff. "
"9069610","9071330"," I think I got 15 pills or something."
"9072870","9073710"," And it was expensive."
"9074330","9075470"," Shit cost me, I kid you not. "
"9075650","9076910"," Like it went to like Walgreens or something."
"9077270","9079070"," It was like $300, $400."
"9079650","9080990"," I was like stupid expensive. "
"9082710","9084670"," And of course my insurance doesn't cover that shit."
"9085550","9086570"," I was like, this is a disaster."
"9088570","9090070"," And but my wife was stoked. "
"9090670","9091910"," She was like, this is fucking awesome."
"9092550","9094490"," So she was like, I shouldn't be swearing."
"9094650","9095150"," I shouldn't be doing this. "
"9095250","9096950"," This is going to get me in trouble talking like this."
"9098590","9101210"," So she's like, you can get those things for like a dollar pill."
"9101430","9102010"," And I was like, no. "
"9102930","9103990"," She's like, yeah, like a dollar."
"9103990","9108430"," So I sent it to the next prescription that I got."
"9109430","9112330"," I sent him to like Amazon or something. "
"9113010","9115030"," I'll have to find out where the next prescription I got was at."
"9115350","9117090"," But I got like 30 or 40 of them."
"9120800","9122440"," So I got like 30 or 40 of them. "
"9122740","9124580"," And they were like a dollar pill or something."
"9124760","9125160"," Three bucks pill."
"9125340","9127440"," So I'm like, woo, dig pills. "
"9127560","9128340"," Remember I want them."
"9129040","9132140"," And I think I got the, I got, I think Cialis."
"9132640","9134400"," So they're like supposed to be like. "
"9135500","9137060"," You get a heart on all week long or something."
"9137300","9137640"," It's calm."
"9138260","9140200"," Well, I've been out drinking and I'm like partying. "
"9140200","9141260"," I'm having a good time."
"9142460","9144000"," I haven't seen my wife and shit."
"9144140","9144980"," I'm like fucking. "
"9145420","9146860"," I'm like, wait."
"9146980","9148000"," I'm gonna take one of these fucking dig pills."
"9148220","9148860"," I'm just gonna, I've been drinking. "
"9149500","9150060"," I'm number one."
"9150100","9151020"," You're not supposed to take those things."
"9151180","9151440"," You're drinking. "
"9152820","9154640"," And then of course, number two."
"9155940","9156800"," When you're drinking."
"9157800","9159160"," You don't make the best decisions. "
"9159820","9160900"," Or at least I don't."
"9161460","9163400"," I'm actually a happy drinker."
"9163400","9166700"," If I drink, I'm usually like 99% of the time. "
"9167000","9168180"," I'm having a great fucking time."
"9168620","9169660"," Try to have a great time."
"9170480","9171880"," So of course, I'm like, fuck yeah. "
"9172000","9172780"," I'm gonna take a dig pill."
"9173880","9176380"," I'll walk around with a heart on for the next week or so."
"9176580","9177060"," I didn't do that. "
"9177320","9178020"," I chewed on it."
"9181600","9181960"," Yeah."
"9184340","9184700"," That's what it was. "
"9184980","9186060"," Cost drugs plus, I think."
"9187440","9188060"," Super master."
"9188400","9188940"," I think it's got it. "
"9189260","9190240"," Cost blood plus drugs."
"9190440","9192720"," I think that's where I got the prescription from."
"9194100","9195800"," Sellers getting rolled over right now. "
"9196520","9198100"," I chewed on one of these things."
"9198900","9200080"," And I don't need dig pills."
"9201540","9205100"," As a matter of fact, I do my thing every year with my doctor. "
"9205360","9207000"," And he's like, I pick my doctor for all kinds of shit."
"9207760","9208780"," I'm like, I want some dig pills."
"9209120","9212720"," I'm like, I want some, can I get some Adderall?"
"9213280","9215860"," And I need, and he's like, fuck you, you didn't know that. "
"9216520","9218460"," Sellers getting steam rolled right now."
"9219940","9223260"," I'm like, I get some mushrooms and some molly."
"9223620","9224740"," And he's like, that's illegal. "
"9225800","9227780"," He's like, that's not illegal in some states."
"9228140","9229700"," And you're never gonna get some Adderall."
"9229700","9230400"," I'm like, fuck. "
"9232580","9234860"," But if you go online, you can get some of that stuff."
"9235040","9236720"," You can go on there and be like, I want testosterone."
"9237460","9240080"," I want penis pills, whatever. "
"9240880","9243020"," Whatever you want, you can pretty much get on the internet."
"9243820","9244160"," Legally."
"9244680","9245960"," Doctor will sign off for you. "
"9251660","9253240"," I shouldn't have chewed that thing."
"9253940","9258820"," I was like running around with like, I was like running around with like, like, I should have went"
"9258820","9259000"," to that."
"9259100","9262980"," Not only did, not only should I probably go to the hospital, like it didn't make me feel good. "
"9263140","9264360"," Like it really fucked me up."
"9264360","9265880"," Like should definitely don't do that."
"9266480","9267040"," Highly recommend. "
"9268080","9270540"," Do not get drunk and chew on a penis pill."
"9271220","9272200"," Do not do it."
"9273140","9274600"," And like a penis hangover. "
"9282410","9283190"," What's up, Superman?"
"9285530","9286190"," Don't do it."
"9288210","9289050"," Especially these things."
"9289230","9292270"," Like this thing's supposed to last a week and I'm just like, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. "
"9293130","9295970"," And that's because poor decision making skills when you've had a few drinks."
"9306350","9307470"," It's so true though."
"9308910","9312710"," And of course if the wife doesn't like you, you're just like, hey, what's up?"
"9313650","9315850"," And she's like, get away from me. "
"9316250","9326070"," I'm trading for 1633 right now."

"9365890","9367610"," Yeah, don't do that."
"9371340","9372620"," I had never taken them either. "
"9372840","9375700"," I got my left friends like, you got to take penis pills."
"9377000","9378740"," They're like, you're like 16 years old again."

"9380360","9381120"," And they're like, you should get them."
"9381200","9381700"," Just get them."

"9419130","9420370"," That's not a good company to look up."
"9421110","9424290"," It's like Amazon, good RX, and whatever the other one that someone said was."
"9430030","9431050"," They're fucking blast. "
"9431370","9431770"," Don't believe it."
"9432090","9434650"," I remember I was like, I remember I was a kid."

"9460910","9462910"," The bones are like, you shall not pass."
"9464150","9465170"," Bearish my ass. "
"9467910","9472570"," Yeah, my mom, of course, as a kid, my mom was like, she's like made sure my room looked nice"
"9472570","9473050"," and shit."
"9473710","9477710"," She's like paint the walls and give me new shades and new blankets and sheets."
"9477710","9479970"," She's a really good mom. "
"9480150","9480690"," She loved me."
"9481510","9483410"," She come in and get my dirty laundry and stuff."
"9483570","9484810"," She was and I played a lot of sports. "
"9484810","9485530"," I was really good."
"9485750","9486830"," It was kind of like an agreement."
"9487190","9487850"," You do go ahead in school. "
"9488590","9489370"," You couldn't sport."
"9490630","9491410"," You don't have to work."
"9492830","9494630"," And you just break your ass doing that stuff. "
"9495030","9497350"," If you break that deal with me, you're going to go get a job."
"9498230","9499490"," And you're not going to play sports."
"9500390","9502090"," And you're going to be in shit, right?"
"9502370","9503090"," That was kind of like the agreement. "
"9504870","9506430"," Was I my parental agreement?"
"9507050","9508090"," Do a good job."
"9509210","9510870"," And I'll take care of you."
"9511110","9511490"," Okay, mom. "
"9512570","9515430"," So of course that rule was that rule was fine."
"9515770","9517510"," All through my adolescence."
"9556070","9557290"," That's really weird. "
"9558090","9559290"," News squawk."
"9559570","9563530"," Nick Temeros made that article this morning at five thirty in the morning."
"9564630","9566190"," Kind of a weirdly timed. "
"9567630","9568190"," News squawk."
"9568830","9572670"," That article came out this morning at five thirty a.m. So it's not new."
"9572950","9575070"," Maybe you just posted about it on Finn Twitter or something. "
"9578330","9582750"," Now the key point from Nick Temeros is the discussion of a pause."
"9583390","9585030"," Not the discussion of a cut."
"9585830","9587310"," Discussion of a pause with a rate hike. "
"9588370","9589370"," So I'm out of course."
"9589810","9592190"," I'll tell I was a preteen teenager."
"9593770","9594750"," Twelve thirteen fourteen. "
"9595750","9598090"," She came in and like changed my room and all this stuff."
"9599450","9600850"," You know, took care of me."
"9601630","9602970"," And then I remember when I hit puberty. "
"9605430","9607570"," Sellers getting steamrolled right now."
"9608230","9612410"," Market trading back to retest the highs at four seventeen fourteen."
"9613190","9614890"," Going back to the scene of the crime. "
"9615610","9619550"," Trying to get back up to our one and actually tagged for seventeen forty four."
"9622230","9623150"," Squeezing right now."
"9624790","9627150"," Look to see if I can catch a back test here. "
"9627250","9630830"," I'd like to catch something like this and then a tag higher here."
"9631830","9633110"," I am flat right now."
"9633530","9635170"," So of course I hit puberty in my mom. "
"9635510","9636990"," I hit puberty and I was like, what is this?"
"9637930","9639790"," I was like, what is this thing that I have?"
"9640770","9645050"," And of course I beat it up for like, you know, like every chance I got didn't matter."
"9645710","9647770"," And I remember like my mom."
"9648670","9651850"," She didn't catch me, but she knew what I was doing. "
"9652850","9654070"," She was like, what are you doing?"
"9654230","9654830"," And I'm like, nothing."
"9655750","9657530"," You know, I didn't do anything."
"9658370","9659730"," And she gave me this eye. "
"9659990","9663310"," That's like evil eye, like squinted her eyes at me."
"9663830","9666290"," And at the time I didn't know that, you know, I had no idea."
"9666530","9669110"," Like parents were and your dad and stuff like that. "
"9669230","9669630"," And your mom."
"9670370","9671750"," And your mom knows everything."
"9672590","9673650"," Like you think your mom's a saint. "
"9675390","9677290"," But she was like, I'm never coming in here again."
"9678370","9679230"," And I was like, what?"
"9680010","9682090"," She's like, you have to take care of your own room for now on."
"9683790","9685790"," And I was like, what do you, what does that mean?"
"9686610","9689950"," And that meant that my mom never came in my bedroom ever again. "
"9691010","9692690"," My bedroom became a shithole."
"9693690","9695370"," Like my clothes didn't get washed."
"9697750","9699230"," Until I moved out of my house. "
"9700930","9707230"," In my room, it then become like a dirty, dirty manhole."
"9709310","9710570"," I'll always remember that."
"9714820","9716500"," Yeah, I was thinking about a pre-workout. "
"9718540","9720280"," I thought I messed up this morning."
"9720440","9722240"," I shouldn't have taken, I shouldn't have eaten oatmeal."
"9722940","9724840"," I should have just, I should have just, um. "
"9727100","9729060"," I should have just like woken up and done the workout."
"9732320","9733060"," Join the Navy."
"9733280","9733800"," I was in the Army. "
"9735040","9735880"," I'm a sailor."
"9736120","9738400"," That's why I have the Captain Jim James."
"9738960","9739740"," I was in the Army. "
"9740700","9741200"," That's true."
"9745960","9746540"," Thanks, Nick."
"9746680","9747320"," I appreciate it, man. "
"9748740","9749680"," Appreciate the support, brother."
"9751340","9753080"," I was in the Army, but I'm a sailor."
"9753440","9754180"," I've got a sailboat. "
"9754960","9756560"," I'm looking for a big ass sailboat."
"9758720","9763520"," Yeah, it's a total dirty bird."
"9764940","9766860"," And of course, I thought I was smarter than my mom. "
"9767020","9767420"," Like, what do you mean?"
"9768240","9769560"," She didn't say anything."
"9769560","9773560"," She didn't like, she wasn't, she wasn't like, not implicit or explicit."
"9774120","9775160"," She wasn't like direct. "
"9776360","9779020"," And my brain was like, did I get caught?"
"9779740","9784900"," Like all these teenager things that you go through is this, like, I don't want to get caught."
"9785780","9788520"," And that's like the biggest thing a boy, young boy is like, never wants to get caught."
"9789660","9792140"," And I hadn't, we hadn't been caught, but she just knew. "
"9792500","9794660"," She was like, he's a fucking teenager."
"9798120","9802060"," And it wasn't like her, I wasn't like her perfect little son anymore."
"9802800","9808670"," Oh, look at that retest right here. "
"9813760","9815640"," I'm missing a trade here right now."
"9816980","9818680"," Four seventeens, hmm."
"9820360","9823280"," Got a bunch of puts going to provide the fuel to go higher, huh?"
"9825360","9826680"," Let me take a look here. "
"9828860","9829380"," All right."

"9840380","9841280"," Smelt funny in there. "
"9841980","9846420"," Any guys that are men out there, do you guys have experiences like talking out of my ass?"
"9846760","9849380"," Like this is an experience that most boys don't go through."
"9849960","9850700"," Maybe it's just me."
"9851680","9853420"," My mom wasn't having anything to do with it. "
"9854600","9856420"," Sellers got run over here."
"9858000","9859780"," Run over right now."
"9865770","9866990"," Look at the VIX. "
"9867370","9868150"," VIX, man."

"9883870","9887530"," I don't know."
"9887550","9890790"," Maybe I'm embarrassing myself when I shouldn't be embarrassing myself. "
"9891670","9902190"," Anyways, if you have sons or if you are a young man, you"
"9902190","9903290"," know, some guys go through that."
"9903790","9904110"," It's okay."
"9907670","9909430"," Hey, thanks, Cosmonaut Project, brother. "
"9909970","9910490"," Appreciate it."
"9914630","9917710"," Superman's saying, personally, I started doing my own laundry because I was embarrassed."
"9918450","9919210"," Mom loved it. "
"9919710","9922610"," Yeah, I think there's something about being like, I don't know what it was."
"9922910","9924090"," I don't know what it was."
"9924090","9924570"," I do know what it was. "
"9924730","9925270"," I hit puberty."
"9926850","9930310"," I'm fucking like, puberty raged through me."
"9930750","9933930"," I had a lot of testosterone running through me. "
"9934370","9934950"," I was a young man."
"9940440","9941040"," Yeah, yeah."
"9942200","9943160"," I agree with that two week. "
"9946220","9949660"," Now we're getting instructions on where to do it in the bathroom in a shower."
"9952940","9955620"," My 17 year old is taking stupid long showers."
"9957840","9959680"," I know you don't want to think about it. "
"9959820","9960280"," I get kids."
"9960460","9961840"," I'm like, I don't want to think about this shit."
"9962820","9963820"," Like, I don't want to think about it. "
"9964000","9966000"," Like mental block, mental block."
"9974150","9975330"," I'll read this Nick Temeros."
"9976070","9977610"," I have some long calls right now. "
"9977670","9979610"," And I'm like, yeah, I'll read this to the bathroom."
"9979690","9981290"," I break and I got to take a piss back."
"9986410","9989730"," Should I just like to go to the bathroom, come back and hope that we're up here at 417?"
"9993090","9996630"," Yeah, I feel bad for like, I've got an older daughter that's going through. "
"9997230","10002350"," I have an older daughter that's in the middle of puberty or the end of it."
"10003150","10003950"," She's 16."
"10006230","10008470"," And I feel that I've always like apologize into her. "
"10008550","10009990"," I'm like, it's the worst experience ever."
"10010810","10013190"," I'm like, and then your girlfriends are going to be nasty."
"10013550","10015830"," And like, the pair pressure the girl goes through sucks. "
"10017150","10023430"," And then, of course, the women have these weird things they have to go through in society where"
"10023430","10029110"," they have to look a certain way or they don't have to, but there's a lot of societal pressure."
"10032170","10036230"," She's going to a, she's on her way to with some friends."
"10036230","10046190"," She's going to Chicago to see one of the BTS members or I"
"10046190","10049190"," guess the BTS bands and the, some of them in the army, some of them are not. "
"10050930","10055070"," And she's going on her own away with friends without me being there."
"10055590","10057170"," We just had to have a conversation about that."
"10061110","10064710"," Like the things you have a conversation with a teenage girl. "
"10065170","10066770"," So I'm having a conversation with my daughter."
"10069410","10070210"," She's a teenager."
"10070510","10071050"," She's 16. "
"10071770","10077870"," So I don't want to have these conversations with her, but you have to can't be a parent."
"10078130","10078490"," We can."
"10078930","10081230"," A lot of parents don't have these conversations with their kids. "
"10082090","10086230"," They learn that they learn from school from books or they don't learn at all until they encounter"
"10086230","10086610"," it."
"10087130","10093130"," But I had to have like conversations with her, you know, it's like, um, they were, they were,"
"10093190","10094730"," we're, we're, we're, we're, we'll talk about that."
"10094910","10102970"," But, you know, what, what a young girl has to watch out for, um, uh, to be careful when they're"
"10102970","10104010"," in public and they're alone. "
"10105230","10109550"," The weirdest part of the conversation that I have with her though, I will tell you though, was, uh,"
"10109830","10111590"," probably a conversation we had to say to her."
"10112750","10120130"," I said to her, um, I said, I want you to know that there will be times in your life"
"10120130","10129730"," where you're going to have experiences that you're not going to, you're going to regret."
"10131230","10133010"," That may not even be your fault. "
"10133610","10134850"," They might, they might be your fault."
"10135050","10137070"," You might think I'm disappointed in you."
"10137770","10141790"," To people in life might threaten you, not to tell your dad. "
"10143570","10148290"," Now you might feel like you can't tell your dad, because I would be disappointed in you."
"10148990","10151530"," Um, angry at you, any of those kind of things."
"10153230","10155490"," Um, and you might have people even threaten you. "
"10156130","10159610"," Oftentimes bad people will threaten you and say, don't tell anybody."
"10160250","10161030"," That kind of stuff."
"10164690","10168730"," And you had to have the conversation with her about, uh, I was like, you know, until you, I was"
"10168730","10173910"," like, until you, um, and I did say, man or woman, I was, I'm coming up with my guy. "
"10174030","10177950"," I was like, yeah, I think she's straight, but I don't know if that she, she could be bisexual or"
"10177950","10179650"," she could be gay and I don't know it."
"10180390","10183670"," But I was like, I was like, until you meet someone that you trust as an adult."
"10183670","10190450"," I was like, when you can adulthood until you meet a friend, husband to wife, a long term partner,"
"10190710","10191970"," something like that, whatever it is. "
"10193030","10203010"," I was like, until that time, you're probably only going to have your mother and father to be there"
"10203010","10203410"," for you."
"10203810","10207130"," Probably the only people you can trust that'll be there for you no matter what."
"10207870","10212690"," No matter what happens, no matter what you go through, and you should rely upon us. "
"10213870","10217130"," For that help, no matter what situation you find yourself in."
"10217990","10223870"," I don't care if you, I was like, if you need somebody in life to be there for you no"
"10223870","10224350"," matter what."
"10225650","10231170"," That's one of the privileges or privileges of having a relationship sometimes with somebody. "
"10232190","10237070"," It's also one of, do you have a good parent to have a parent that's always there for you no"
"10237070","10238710"," matter what, even if you've done something wrong."
"10239390","10241210"," I mean, like even criminal stuff."
"10241870","10246590"," Sometimes you'll see people say, why is, why is that person's parents stand by in that person even"
"10246590","10248570"," though they committed this horrendous crime. "
"10249210","10255130"," Oftentimes it's because the only person that person only has parents there for them."
"10255310","10259250"," Sometimes it's a husband or a sister or a friend or a wife or whatever."
"10260670","10268390"," But oftentimes children, your children won't want to come to you and tell you something because"
"10268390","10268690"," you're going to be there. "
"10268690","10269330"," You're going to be pissed at them."
"10271090","10273310"," And you're going to be like, you're going to pass judgment on them."
"10273550","10275830"," And I'm like, those are the things that you have to come and talk to me about. "
"10276510","10278610"," Or your mom, don't feel comfortable with me."
"10278750","10279870"," Talk to your mom about these things."
"10281070","10287710"," But if someone ever threatens you, or tells you don't tell anybody, always feel like that door is"
"10287710","10289530"," open for you as a child. "
"10289750","10293530"," Until you say, hey, daddy, I don't need you one day, or mommy, I don't need you any day, or"
"10293530","10297330"," this guy, this guy Bob loves me the most."
"10298030","10299430"," You don't understand me, daddy."
"10300630","10302530"," You know, whatever that shit is. "
"10307150","10308750"," I'm going to go potty really bad."
"10315780","10319380"," You young dog, someone got in the room one time and looked over and saw the tilted head that was"
"10319380","10320460"," asking that stuff, are you okay?"
"10328150","10331950"," Yeah, so my thought on natural gas was, own it, not trade it."
"10331950","10335270"," Like not by options, but on the underlying. "
"10337990","10342090"," It should be starting soon, this month, not today, but this month."
"10343070","10345490"," Spine out trade in 416, 70."
"10346990","10349610"," Still in 417 C's right now. "
"10350170","10351250"," Have to take a pee pee really bad."
"10353050","10354510"," I'm going to get stuck here."
"10358410","10359850"," But as a parent, it's hard. "
"10359850","10364330"," Like if you have kids, it's hard to be like, and she's going away without me."
"10364530","10368250"," And I'm like, well, like look, I'm like, don't talk to people that you don't know."
"10369570","10370630"," Like you're a young woman. "
"10370650","10374790"," I'm like, if you don't know people out there, they got no business talking to you."
"10375090","10378970"," I was like, some guy trying to talk to you when you're 16 years old, some man."
"10380950","10384610"," They got no reason to be, I was told her, I was like, when I'm on the boat and I"

"10393930","10395330"," Or, oh, she's smart."
"10395470","10396090"," I want to talk to her."
"10396450","10399470"," I was like, normally someone wants to talk to you because you have a reason to. "
"10400010","10402650"," When you're a 16 year old girl, grown men should be talking to you."
"10402650","10403050"," Not in the street."
"10403450","10405390"," Just go to the hotel or something like that. "
"10406050","10407170"," Some random wants to talk to her."
"10407230","10408150"," I'm like, don't talk to those people."
"10409030","10410070"," I'm like, talk to your friends. "
"10410070","10411550"," Stay together as a group."
"10412590","10413830"," I'm like, oh, I just have your cell phone."
"10413830","10415570"," They're ready to dial daddy. "
"10419920","10420500"," That's right."
"10420620","10421200"," You don't leave your post."
"10421860","10423100"," So you're properly relieved. "
"10424740","10426320"," Say a fifth general order, I think."
"10434800","10435760"," Oh, dude, Winky."
"10436520","10437660"," I've had those moments, Winky. "
"10438960","10439680"," I've had it."

"10442780","10443640"," She's coming around. "
"10444020","10445320"," I don't know if she's just appeasing me."
"10446300","10447260"," I've had those moments."
"10447600","10448840"," Those things are soul-crashing, Winky. "
"10449720","10451560"," When your kid doesn't want to do what you want to do."
"10453000","10455360"," She's in this phase with BTS right now, too."

"10462540","10465340"," And she's like, she's like, I'll get those records, daddy. "
"10466620","10469540"," It is fine wine, but it's not my taste right now."

"10575440","10577820"," Uh, bought him specialized grow bike."
"10577840","10579540"," He has never even learned how to ride a bicycle."
"10580240","10586040"," Uh, I have a moto, moto bicain eagle. "
"10590440","10592660"," I've got a full suspension bike."
"10609110","10612330"," I was a marathon, so I kind of fucked up this week."
"10612890","10615470"," So I've got a, so I've got a, well, I don't know if I fucked up. "
"10615590","10616610"," So I got a moto bicain eagle."
"10617490","10625470"," And, um, I have a, or I had, um, what was it called?"
"10626870","10629230"," A, um, so I had a city bike."
"10631990","10635490"," Um, I just, I think, I think my wife sold it. "
"10636810","10638030"," Uh, this week."
"10639030","10642350"," Now, I have some questions for you guys that are, that are bicyclists."
"10643250","10646970"," Uh, I'll, I'll probably be pissed. "
"10647190","10648810"," I'll be, I think I'm going to be upset if I."
"10653970","10655670"," Uh, what the fuck was the name of my city bike?"
"10655830","10657590"," So anyways, so I have a city bike."
"10659970","10661210"," Miss girl through here."
"10663090","10663770"," Oh, nice. "
"10668320","10670160"," Yeah, I've only got one mountain bike right now."
"10673040","10674080"," I don't have a quiver."
"10674740","10677120"," If any of you guys are bicyclists out there, you probably know these terms. "
"10677680","10679080"," I don't have a quiver of bikes anymore."
"10680040","10684540"," And as a matter of fact, I think my wife sold my city bike."
"10685820","10687800"," This weekend, and I'm not sure yet. "
"10687800","10691100"," I noticed that it was missing from its hanger."
"10691520","10693860"," I don't know if I meant to tell her not to sell it."
"10695560","10698820"," And with the reason that, well, I should, I'm fucking all this up. "
"10700260","10703200"," So I think I know I told her to sell it."
"10703200","10706540"," I was like, sell, I was like, well, my, so my youngest."
"10708500","10712320"," My, my youngest is growing into a more expensive bike. "
"10714720","10719080"," And I was like, why don't you get rid of the city bikes and we'll get her an expensive mountain"
"10719080","10719700"," bike, right?"
"10720080","10720960"," I think that was the conversation."
"10721360","10723140"," But then last week."
"10724740","10725960"," Or the week before. "
"10727960","10730220"," Uh, and I hadn't talked to my wife about this."
"10730380","10731160"," I'm going to be pissed off."
"10731160","10732700"," I'm going to find out what I got. "
"10732800","10733940"," It's like green city bike."
"10734000","10734380"," It's beautiful."
"10734780","10735680"," It's in like mint condition. "
"10736740","10737960"," It's fucking hipster."
"10739980","10743020"," It's, oh, dude, it looks like, uh, nope, that's still under suspension."
"10743700","10744560"," It's going to be, isn't it?"
"10746180","10746900"," The, uh. "
"10752210","10754550"," Anyways, we have like a quiver of city bikes."
"10754830","10755970"," We have a quiver of mountain bikes."
"10756530","10757890"," I get to have my wife to sell it. "
"10758070","10760270"," And I meant to tell my wife not to sell it."
"10760270","10762930"," And I think she did over the weekend."
"10764090","10765790"," The reason that I didn't want her to sell. "
"10765910","10770770"," Well, the reason I wanted to sell this to city bike was because I don't have a lot of opportunity"
"10770770","10771350"," to ride it."
"10771950","10773350"," Like I used to got west."
"10773350","10776950"," I was able to ride it everywhere in town around town with bike paths and everything. "
"10777550","10779830"," Having as much time to ride it here in Michigan."
"10780470","10784710"," I do, but it's always like throwing on a bike rack, take it somewhere, then ride it."
"10785590","10788230"," Um, it's where I feel safest is on a path. "
"10789000","10795680"," I don't feel safe riding city streets here in Detroit."
"10796480","10796660"," So."
"10798140","10799240"," Told her to sell it. "
"10799800","10800760"," I shouldn't have done that."
"10802520","10804180"," And the reason being."
"10805360","10808280"," Is I'm going to do the, um. "
"10809940","10810740"," Let me unload this up."
"10815110","10816710"," Maybe some of you guys know about this."
"10817830","10818770"," Okay, so. "
"10820710","10822710"," I'm going to do the rag."
"10823090","10825530"," Bri bike ride."
"10826270","10826970"," Cross Iowa. "
"10829250","10834410"," And initially I was like, well, maybe I'll buy an electric road bike."
"10835390","10840110"," And I looked at the prices and I was like, that's like three to $10,000."
"10841430","10842590"," And I don't road bike. "
"10843390","10844470"," I'm not into that shit."
"10844870","10845230"," I'm sorry."
"10845330","10846530"," I can't do it. "
"10847070","10848130"," Not a road break, bro."
"10848730","10849510"," A lot of guys are."
"10849610","10850110"," I'm not that guy. "
"10850370","10851470"," I'll be honest, but."
"10852830","10855130"," This right across Iowa isn't a race."
"10855370","10857170"," It's kind of like enjoy yourself, kind of a thing. "
"10857410","10858390"," And it's fucking far."
"10858570","10859470"," It's like 500 miles."
"10860050","10862810"," And there's like a hundred mile or there's one day of a hundred mile. "
"10863210","10867510"," And then there's like a bunch of like 50s, 60s, 70 or an 80 thrown in."
"10867850","10869130"," It's seven straight days."
"10869450","10870090"," There's no day off. "
"10871390","10872030"," It's far."
"10873070","10874210"," And there are some climbs."
"10874210","10878050"," Not steep, but like sustained elevation gains. "
"10879510","10883550"," And furthermore, sitting on a hard seat for seven days, it sucks."
"10884330","10885750"," Now this bike ride is not a race."
"10886370","10887550"," There's some fun mixed in. "
"10887990","10888990"," I'm not a road biker."
"10889790","10895810"," So it's not like I'm putting out 20, 30, 40 miles in a century ride every month or something."
"10896570","10897370"," So it's not my jam. "
"10897910","10900190"," It's not who I am and I'm not interested."
"10900510","10902390"," I'll be honest, I'm uninterested in training for this thing."
"10904270","10908170"," I'm not interested in riding a road bike for fucking three to five months to get ready for this"
"10908170","10908590"," trip. "
"10909190","10912730"," And I want to enjoy myself like a road biker would on this ride."
"10913250","10916550"," So if I was a road biker, I'd ride a regular road bike."
"10917010","10918850"," And I'd probably enjoy the entire trip. "
"10920990","10922170"," I know I'm not gonna."
"10922410","10923170"," So I'm getting older."
"10923690","10924450"," Like, you know, I'm older, man. "
"10925130","10926090"," I'm a fucking 40s."
"10926290","10927990"," Like, no fucking way."
"10928630","10930370"," So I'm like, okay. "
"10931630","10935110"," What I'll do is I get a hybrid road bike and I'm like, no price too much."
"10935330","10935750"," No way I'm not."
"10935870","10936610"," I can't justify it. "
"10937830","10942010"," So this weekend or like later later this week, I'm like, you know what I will do?"
"10942510","10946710"," I'll buy an electric bike conversion kit and I'll throw it on my city bike and I'll put some"
"10946710","10947830"," comfort handles on it."
"10948430","10954210"," And I'll ride this electric bike in this rag, or this rag, rag, bry event and it'll be perfect."
"10954490","10957090"," It's got road tires on it, big, big old wheels on it. "
"10957690","10960130"," The electric setup will probably cost me."
"10960570","10961150"," I don't know."
"10961370","10964930"," Three to 600 bucks somewhere in there, maybe 700 on the high end. "
"10965690","10970570"," If I really wanted to make my fat ass get rid and free the whole way."
"10971050","10972370"," Free the whole way."
"10973030","10977970"," So I'm like, I'm gonna get, I'm gonna convert the city bike to a hybrid. "
"10979350","10981690"," I think she sold the fucking bike over the weekend."
"10982610","10984030"," So now I'm up Schitt's Creek."
"10986430","10988710"," And there's no way I'm converting my mountain bike. "
"10989090","10992210"," This thing's like full travel, full suspension."
"10993350","10994690"," Oh, I got to buy some of my bike."
"10995730","10998930"," It's like my mountain bike's worth like six or seven grand. "
"10999550","11001490"," Well, it didn't cost it that much, but it's worth that much."
"11002330","11003030"," Trade in 416."
"11003670","11003970"," 79. "
"11004470","11005290"," 45 cent."
"11005430","11006750"," Do not pay any of these calls, dude."
"11008530","11010210"," They're not paying these calls right now. "
"11010290","11011470"," They're refusing to pay these calls."
"11013990","11016070"," I've been long calls here for like half an hour."
"11017930","11020690"," Yeah, I got my bikes. "
"11021090","11024210"," Most of my family bikes, I got them from a bikes direct."
"11026190","11027610"," So like polygon bikes."
"11027930","11029850"," They're made, they're all made in Taiwan and shit. "
"11030330","11031590"," All the components are kick ass."
"11032910","11036710"," What they do is they make bikes for American bike makers, and they take the stickers off them."
"11036810","11037890"," They call them something else. "
"11038910","11040410"," Look up bikes direct sometime."
"11041150","11042590"," You get a kick ass mountain bike on there."
"11044690","11047050"," Get them for a couple grand, 1500 bucks to grand. "
"11048030","11049630"," It's like a three to five thousand dollar bike."
"11050630","11051390"," Trade in 416."
"11051870","11052850"," 85 right now. "
"11053370","11055070"," Start printing these fucking calls."
"11057290","11058630"," 47 cents on 417."
"11059790","11060990"," Just trading this bitch boat. "
"11061170","11061550"," I shouldn't be swearing."
"11061930","11063210"," Just trading this thing back and forth."
"11070010","11072250"," Yeah, call premium is dead in a door. "
"11072390","11074110"," Now 48 cents right now and calls."
"11076670","11078270"," Trading into sellers above."
"11080110","11082010"," I'm going to get out of this trade up here, I think. "
"11083370","11084470"," Coming into some resistance."
"11085670","11087510"," I'm going to go potty here soon."
"11088350","11091610"," Let's let's let's open it up a little bit and see what's up there with the supply is. "
"11092730","11093690"," 49 cents."
"11098410","11099610"," So this race."
"11100170","11101750"," If you guys don't know it, look it up. "
"11102350","11107210"," It's called the rag brigh, rag brigh, rag brigh, rag brigh."
"11107630","11108590"," Something like that."
"11108970","11109210"," All right. "
"11109290","11111970"," I think I'm going to get out of this trade here."
"11114950","11115530"," All right."
"11115710","11119870"," Some flat on 47 cents, which says rag brigh race is pretty cool. "
"11120010","11121190"," Watch some YouTube videos and that shit."
"11121990","11123070"," But here's the key though."
"11123070","11127010"," If you're not a road biker, you probably want some kind of assisted trip. "
"11128410","11132450"," You can take a sag wagon, but you know you're not going to want to take a sag wagon."
"11133870","11137230"," There's like all these kitsch in all these different towns across Iowa."
"11137490","11138170"," It's seven days. "
"11139110","11141310"," People are going to tell you that they there's this."
"11141470","11143910"," I think it's called the pork chop thing or I don't know."
"11144090","11149270"," Like there's an outfitter that'll give you a tent and provide sag wagons. "
"11149310","11150810"," They think in showers and food."
"11151950","11153190"," It'll help you along the way."
"11153570","11157310"," But there are other people that will take RVs with them with a crew of people or a team. "
"11159810","11163110"," And I just don't want to I don't want to have an unenjoyable time."
"11163250","11164170"," I want to have an enjoyable time."
"11164410","11164870"," I want to ride. "
"11165970","11167670"," Get assisted when I need to get assistance."
"11168670","11171830"," And I want time in each one of these towns so that I can spend some money."
"11172690","11172990"," I don't know. "
"11173070","11178270"," Drink beer from a I don't know like a gravity something fed from the top of a bar or something."
"11179140","11187070"," I agree with that would need a."
"11188910","11193810"," A week he's saying that he bought a couple thirteen point five C UPS T."
"11196750","11202710"," Five nineteen's will stop less than twelve dollars and sixty cents earnings are on May ninth."
"11203330","11204130"," Thanks for that week. "

"11594540","11597840"," passes on a single track because you're broken down and old. "

"11603720","11605600"," Probably hasn't destroyed their body yet. "

"11612760","11616440"," Is the number of people that can get out there and do that shit anymore as they get older it"
"11616440","11622540"," get the numbers window like mid 30s early 40s when you start looking at 50 year olds and 60 year"
"11622540","11624300"," olds there's not that many guys out there doing it."
"11625140","11627500"," And mostly it's because they broke their bodies doing it. "

"11778400","11779320"," That goes line. "
"11781280","11785200"," So I think if you're not like if you're not putting miles on a road bike day in, day out,"
"11785360","11787300"," year round decade, decade after decade."
"11789500","11791620"," You're going to get hurt if you're just riding."
"11796790","11798970"," But Jack, man, I'll make it known when I go. "
"11799710","11800490"," I'll hook up with you brother."
"11803530","11804610"," Yes, honors are cool."
"11806430","11807730"," That's right for site finance. "
"11808510","11810890"," John Hagedy, baby bicycle bear bong."
"11811870","11814930"," Johnny said he did do a 60 mile or in the rolling hills of Iowa."
"11819870","11822230"," No, I'm looking at right now. "
"11822230","11823430"," Just so just in the background."
"11829700","11831480"," I'm watching right here is."
"11834200","11836820"," I'm watching the Vix right here and I'm like, yeah. "
"11838100","11838940"," Here's a Vix."
"11840660","11842680"," None of this shit's changed down here."
"11842960","11844280"," 1475, 1411. "
"11844500","11845280"," Last time I left you."
"11846240","11847820"," Talked about those numbers down there."
"11851000","11856080"," There's another one right there. "
"11856080","11856620"," Rejection."
"11858160","11860240"," Now this looks bearish."
"11860880","11862280"," For Vix, believe it or not. "
"11862880","11866560"," But just intraday on Vic, intraday on Vix."
"11869420","11871700"," You know, it's kind of a double bottom right there."
"11872920","11876140"," Although Vix rolling over even more is not out of the question. "
"11877080","11878000"," But you know, it's Monday."
"11878980","11881060"," We have two more sessions left."
"11882800","11885840"," You know, we got, you know, we got two more sessions left, right?"
"11886000","11890080"," We got the second and then we kind of like sell. "
"11890480","11892400"," We usually will sell like the second end of day."
"11894700","11898000"," Think about this, right?"
"11898180","11901160"," We usually sell Tuesday heading into the close."
"11901380","11902300"," Like one o'clock in the afternoon. "
"11902520","11903440"," I expect I'll start selling."
"11905260","11906440"," Bleed off into the third."
"11907620","11908220"," But even today. "
"11910160","11911180"," Squeeze higher in the Vix."
"11911320","11913860"," Then the rollover into tomorrow around one o'clock in the afternoon."
"11913860","11914740"," That makes sense to me. "
"11917460","11918640"," So just right here."
"11921060","11922080"," Just right here."
"11922540","11923500"," Where we are right now. "
"11924780","11925820"," Let's think about this."
"11928520","11929980"," I think cap's on."
"11930620","11932680"," Look at that. "
"11939890","11941550"," I think cap's on here."
"11942510","11945810"," R2 and there's our three four twenty one ninety six."
"11949810","11954550"," If I'm going to anticipate that at one o'clock in the afternoon, we're going to start selling one"
"11954550","11955170"," to three o'clock. "
"11955270","11955770"," Start selling."
"11957170","11959070"," Probably going to go there at some point, right?"
"11961590","11964550"," Maybe a dip in the Vix and then the move up into here."
"11965690","11967330"," So we get a little bit of a roll. "
"11968270","11968730"," Come back up."
"11968990","11969450"," Sell it up."
"11974010","11975330"," Maybe it's a dip in the Vix. "
"11976790","11977770"," This kind of nonsense."
"11981510","11983270"," Those are four eighteen ninety four."
"11984870","11985290"," R2. "
"11986610","11987510"," Bloodbath it down."
"11987970","11989230"," Ripped up into four twenty one."
"11990190","11990570"," Wrap it up. "
"11990810","11991430"," Pack it up boys."
"11991670","11992750"," We're out of here for cell may."
"11993390","11996050"," Four twenty one ninety six up here. "
"11998750","11999550"," Oh, sorry."
"11999670","12000230"," I mean peanuts."
"12001490","12002010"," Starving. "
"12011110","12012090"," FOMC over here."
"12014790","12016790"," Where the Vix is bottoming right now."
"12022920","12023920"," Away to decision. "
"12025940","12026860"," Something like that."
"12027560","12029100"," Do I think it's this one right here?"
"12029780","12031560"," Away to decision or maybe I should."
"12032180","12035420"," I think it's this one into tomorrow and then away to decision. "
"12035740","12038300"," Sell down at four twenty or something on Tuesday."
"12039040","12039820"," It's a tough one, man."
"12039880","12040320"," It's possible. "
"12041960","12045280"," I'll tell you what, if you want that four twenty before Tuesday, Wednesday."
"12051700","12055200"," As long as price stays above four seventeen, you're on it."
"12061210","12062910"," I'm not anti this trade here going higher. "
"12062910","12071760"," I think we get the roll here."
"12076160","12080000"," I think you get a roll and you look for a dip to buy into one o'clock tomorrow."
"12082620","12083560"," That's what I think. "
"12106190","12108330"," Four seventeen sixty two."
"12108490","12120760"," Let me look"
"12120760","12121500"," at estal for you."
"12137730","12143810"," You know, estal is getting crispy, but I'm not saying don't buy estal here. "
"12151440","12153680"," It's just starting the topping process."
"12155320","12157460"," Spy is just starting the topping process."
"12164410","12165570"," So is it now?"
"12165830","12167850"," Is it tomorrow?"
"12170910","12178090"," I don't think I'm not anti you buying put spreads here or something or estal calls for June, July. "
"12178090","12183090"," I don't think you should do dailies, though."
"12192600","12193840"," Yes, so Bill is dangerous."
"12194760","12197280"," Ragbri, R-A-G-B-R-A-I. "
"12200000","12203000"," I'm going to warn you out there if you're, no, not warn you."
"12205760","12210040"," So I was talking about with my buddy from Park City and I was like, look, here's the deal."
"12211220","12214340"," I was like, I can go to a fucking, oh, look at that above. "
"12214680","12219300"," Look right there, those orange bars up there."
"12220760","12221940"," Stink beds up there."
"12223620","12224320"," Look at that. "
"12224460","12225100"," Look at this."
"12231620","12233140"," These orange bars right here."
"12240550","12247770"," So I go to these mountain bike festivals with my buddy and they're blast. "
"12247770","12250430"," Like, show up, there's music."
"12251490","12252950"," You camp for free."
"12254030","12255230"," There's demo bikes. "
"12256170","12256770"," There's music."
"12257950","12259290"," There's hot chicks everywhere."
"12260590","12263350"," I mean, hot dude, hot women everywhere. "
"12266850","12267830"," Party every night."
"12270670","12274610"," And if you get hurt, you go back to your camp and you party some more."
"12278970","12281410"," Like road bikers, they're another breed. "
"12282230","12283230"," Like, they're animals."
"12286130","12288410"," Like, endurance bike riders."
"12290230","12291430"," Hold another breed. "
"12292690","12296530"," They're like, no offense to your road bike enthusiast."
"12298310","12299970"," They practice exercising."
"12301930","12305070"," So if you're a road biker, you practice exercising. "
"12305710","12307270"," You're like a crossfitter."
"12308210","12309690"," You practice exercising."
"12312430","12313910"," Like, I want to go do the jump. "
"12314450","12317870"," I don't want to do the 50 miles and feel the pain."
"12318850","12319870"," Some people like it."
"12320050","12320410"," I don't. "
"12327710","12331170"," So that doesn't mean I can't have fun at one of these events."
"12334350","12342910"," But I know for a fact, from my experience, if I attempt to go do that, with that some assistance,"
"12343770","12344650"," I'm going to have a bad time."
"12346230","12347990"," And some of these people that are making videos. "
"12349350","12352450"," I mean, there are some people that are making videos and they're way out of shape."
"12364810","12367210"," And I was like, I fucking ridden 100 miles."
"12367730","12368530"," I've done a century ride. "
"12369670","12372030"," I'm not being a road bike enthusiast."
"12372990","12374930"," Let me tell you what, the fucking shit hurts."
"12375970","12377650"," Anyone tells you that it doesn't hurt. "
"12378430","12379890"," It's talking out of their ass."
"12381110","12388310"," And if you're not trained to ride a century and you do one, you ain't doing shit the next day."
"12388690","12390370"," You ain't doing a fucking thing. "
"12391070","12393210"," You probably ain't doing shit for the next week."
"12395170","12395650"," Guaranteed."
"12396830","12398730"," So I'm watching these YouTube videos. "
"12398890","12402650"," And they're like, yeah, I completed the entire rag-bry, a rag-bray or whatever."
"12402990","12405850"," And, you know, boy, that 100 mile it was hard."
"12406010","12408710"," But I got through it and I'm like, that YouTuber is lying. "
"12411590","12414290"," I'm like that YouTuber is talking right out of their ass."
"12414790","12416890"," That fucking YouTuber was not a fucking sag wagon."
"12417770","12423590"," And that person either did not complete the entire week, did not complete the 100th century. "
"12424390","12426010"," It's just point blank lying."
"12426590","12427850"," Some YouTubers were honest."
"12428130","12430490"," They were like, you know, I have an electric bike. "
"12431370","12433290"," Or I jumped on a sag wagon."
"12433290","12435010"," But some of them were just pulled face lying."
"12435010","12436130"," And I'm like, this is bullshit. "
"12437850","12439810"," I'm like, I don't care how good you look either."
"12441350","12447230"," If you don't ride road bikes all the time, you're not putting out 500 miles in seven days."
"12448010","12449850"," Your ass will be in the grass, I guarantee it. "
"12450830","12451270"," Sorry."
"12451650","12455870"," I don't care how flat you think it is."
"12455950","12456710"," It's not that flat either. "
"12456890","12458010"," I always got nice hills."
"12459950","12461390"," But I'm calling bullshit."
"12462070","12462510"," Probably. "
"12464210","12469430"," I'm calling bullshit probably on anyone that's not a road biker."
"12470130","12473590"," I'm calling bullshit on like 80% of the videos they watched."
"12473970","12474970"," I'm like, they got a sag wagon. "
"12475910","12478330"," They're, I don't know, husband or wife, met him in an RV."
"12478490","12480710"," They threw the bike in the back and met people the next town."
"12481250","12482230"," Where was that they did?"
"12488950","12489690"," Yeah, Nino. "
"12490010","12492270"," Joe Donut was talking about that century."
"12492830","12496710"," Joe Donut was saying there's a ride across Georgia event too."
"12500590","12501370"," Yeah, Superman. "
"12503090","12507670"," Like if you're not, if you're not climbing the mountains of Colorado, you just climb one long ass"
"12507670","12508190"," hill in Iowa."
"12508250","12509190"," That's going to suck, right?"
"12509190","12511290"," It's like a 50 miles straight up."
"12522920","12523560"," Yeah, Brian. "
"12523660","12524620"," I'll just say and rag, rise."
"12524860","12525040"," No joke."
"12525240","12525880"," I agree, Brian. "
"12526080","12527360"," Dude, you should watch some of these people on YouTube."
"12527560","12528840"," I'm like, these fucking people are lying."
"12529620","12536880"," Matter of fact, I don't think I've ever watched a YouTube, like a YouTube, like, like idea, like,"
"12537020","12538820"," Hey, I want to go do this or I want to go do that. "
"12538940","12546260"," I don't think I've ever seen more people bullshit in their videos than rag, right?"
"12546560","12549780"," Like, no, I'm not talking about regular road bikers."
"12549900","12552020"," I'm talking about like Bob and Sue."
"12553140","12554780"," Like there's like people out there. "
"12554820","12559100"," There's like, like, I've been working in an office for 20 years."
"12559820","12563340"," I've never ever exercised in my entire life."
"12564120","12565960"," And I just whipped out 500 miles. "
"12566160","12566600"," Like it was nothing."
"12566600","12568540"," And I was like, get the fuck out of here."
"12569080","12571900"," It's like, it's like, I've tried doing that. "
"12572540","12574200"," It's like, get out of here."
"12574820","12575900"," It's like, stop."
"12577320","12582380"," The worst part was, I'm like, you're sending people in this YouTube video to go do this thing, and"
"12582380","12583400"," they're going to have a bad time. "
"12584020","12587440"," When all they want to do, my point here is leading back to the mountain bike festival."
"12588120","12589120"," Go to a mountain bike festival."
"12589660","12592440"," You can pick and choose your poison and the length of time in your poison. "
"12592960","12593680"," You're going to rag-ry."
"12594440","12595200"," You're locked in."
"12596160","12597080"," You're locked in. "
"12597740","12601880"," You better have, like, five different pairs of stretchy people."
"12601880","12602120"," You better have your pants."
"12605660","12607260"," I mean, you better be good. "
"12609300","12610340"," Start luving up."
"12620220","12621280"," Yeah, it's a great ride."
"12621440","12622600"," I'm not anti-doing it. "
"12622680","12626780"," I'm just saying, I guess my point here is, if I was going to do this ride, right?"
"12628540","12632980"," I would definitely want to take an electric assisted bike, number one."
"12634840","12638400"," Because I don't ever want to have a moment where I'm like, I got to drop out."
"12639300","12642260"," I already know I'm going to be like, if I don't have electric assist bike, I'm going to want to"
"12642260","12643180"," ride the whole entire thing. "
"12643860","12646280"," I'm going to want to ride the whole thing without an electric assist."
"12647820","12650540"," I know that by day three, I'm going to be fucking pissed."
"12652340","12655460"," Because I'm going to be worn out, tired, hurt, pain. "
"12656200","12658900"," I'm not going to want to wake up like day three and be like, fuck this."
"12659320","12661800"," And I think day three is the century, maybe day four."
"12662640","12665260"," Whatever that century happens afterwards, I'm like, I'm done. "
"12667060","12671360"," And the worst part is, I wouldn't enjoy myself after a certain, like the middle of it, I probably"
"12671360","12672000"," wouldn't enjoy myself."
"12672720","12678080"," So at least for me, not being a road biker, I want to enjoy the entire thing."
"12678440","12680560"," I want to, like, I want to, on a pedal when I want to pedal. "
"12681340","12683060"," I want to not pedal when I don't want to have to pedal."
"12684040","12686120"," I want to enjoy the people I meet along the way."
"12686780","12687600"," I want to have a good time. "
"12688220","12688740"," I don't want to get hurt."
"12689460","12692020"," I don't want to leave with a bad taste in my mouth."
"12693220","12695060"," And I want to enjoy every time I go into. "
"12697140","12699420"," And, you know, I just want to have a good time."
"12699600","12700300"," I'm not there to race."
"12702720","12707240"," So, and I'm certainly not going to spend all this money to go there to do just a section. "
"12707460","12709240"," If I lived in Iowa, fuck yeah."
"12709980","12714180"," I'd ride like a day, have a party with my family and friends, be done with it."
"12714780","12721000"," I'm taking, like, a truck and a sag wagon with, like, all bunch of shit behind it. "
"12721420","12722100"," But it's my friends."
"12722960","12723960"," I'm going to have a good time."
"12729150","12732110"," There's no reason, no reason it to. "
"12733130","12736970"," Now, if you're a road biker, that's different."
"12737550","12738590"," It's a different conversation."
"12738850","12740190"," If you're like, I can put on 500 miles. "
"12740350","12740630"," It's nothing."
"12741390","12742070"," I know what that entails."
"12742710","12745110"," I know what it means to break parts of my bike. "
"12746770","12750470"," I know how to change tire and how to change brakes and how to do whatever it takes to get"
"12750470","12750710"," there."
"12751750","12753330"," I know how much my body can go through."
"12754230","12756490"," You know, you get wind and rain and all that kind of stuff. "
"12758130","12760510"," You could turn a really good experience or a bad experience."
"12760510","12761470"," And I just don't want that."
"12762630","12763910"," My buddy doesn't either. "
"12764210","12765990"," Dude, nice to ride with this guy."
"12766170","12769850"," We rode all the time and we've been to all kinds of mountain bike festivals."
"12769850","12770870"," He's the same way. "
"12770970","12772110"," He's like, fuck, no, I ain't doing that."
"12772310","12772790"," Me neither."
"12773030","12778030"," If I'm the only way I'm doing this rag-brite thing is if I have a good time. "
"12778330","12779850"," Like, I want to guarantee a good time."
"12782870","12783810"," That's what I agree, John."
"12784210","12784850"," Like, I want to be able to. "
"12784910","12789790"," So some of these people on YouTube are like, they're drinking beers along the way."
"12791810","12793150"," And they have electric assist bikes."
"12793810","12794790"," There's other people. "
"12795750","12798050"," They're like, there's some piece."
"12798290","12802810"," One of these YouTube videos had someone that was completely unhealthy."
"12805210","12806110"," It's older. "
"12808810","12810470"," Like mid 30s, early 40s."
"12812970","12815370"," And looked like they'd dive a heart attack tomorrow."
"12815690","12817950"," And they were like, yeah, they're just videotaping themselves. "
"12818290","12820130"," They were taping, but you know, video themselves drinking beers."
"12821370","12822530"," As they're doing the 100 mile."
"12822670","12825590"," And I'm like, that fucking guy, there ain't no fucking way that guy is doing 100 miles. "
"12826370","12827510"," Dude, no fucking way."
"12827890","12828790"," I've rode a bike drinking."
"12829290","12830890"," I've done it. "
"12831150","12832550"," It's like there's no way it's happening."
"12835270","12837130"," It's like there's just no way that's possible."
"12837550","12841110"," That guy's like taking video himself, drinking a beer, and then jumping on a sag wagon as he's"
"12841110","12841310"," doing. "
"12841810","12843170"," And then he's telling people he's doing it."
"12843230","12843830"," And I'm like, they didn't have."
"12843950","12844570"," But I want to do that. "
"12844730","12845410"," I want to have like a beer."
"12846170","12847050"," I want to have a gin and tonic."
"12847050","12851550"," I want to ride 20, 30 miles an electric assisted bike and get there. "
"12851850","12852950"," I want to be like, Hey, I showed up."
"12854350","12857410"," If I'm not feeling this, I'm still going to have a good goddamn time."
"12860350","12860750"," Yeah. "
"12860890","12861170"," Yeah."
"12861450","12862210"," Oh, yeah, man."
"12862730","12863670"," I mean, one beer. "
"12863790","12864830"," I don't mean like a six pack."
"12866910","12871690"," I mean, like one, like you're drinking one beer while your ride makes you tired as fuck."
"12871930","12872610"," Well, you know it, right?"
"12872770","12873810"," It just, it feels like pain. "
"12874150","12875170"," You never even get drunk."
"12875790","12877430"," You didn't even get to that point where you're buzzing."
"12877910","12880490"," Like if you have a beer and you start, you start riding hard. "
"12881010","12882270"," Trust me, you're like, this sucks."
"12883090","12884150"," I'm only having one beer."
"12884350","12884550"," I'm done. "
"12885130","12886450"," Tomorrow, no beers while I ride."
"12898440","12902000"," Yeah, if you're, if you're a road biker, I feel like I got a road bike."
"12902500","12903200"," This is what I do. "
"12903480","12904200"," I enjoy myself."
"12904900","12906700"," I know what it means to sit in a hard ass seat."
"12907140","12911280"," I've got a bunch of different, uh, uh, tights that I can put on. "
"12911280","12914040"," So the different, different places, like different paddings."
"12914180","12915200"," So I don't get all fucked up."
"12915680","12920020"," I got like a pound, like 10 pound, 10 pound lube injection in my butt and all that kind of"
"12920020","12920240"," stuff. "
"12920500","12920940"," Have at it."
"12922020","12925620"," Uh, but that, that person that does that knows what it entails."
"12927580","12933300"," My point was some, if you're, if you think you don't, if you're, if you're not a road biker, if"
"12933300","12936400"," you think you're going out there and you're going to put 500 miles on seven days and have a fun"
"12936400","12938240"," time, no fucking way. "
"12939700","12940920"," No fucking way."
"12946820","12948080"," That's what I was thinking, Brian."
"12950380","12952060"," I'll definitely do the pitstop bear. "
"12953520","12957540"," But if I do the pitstop bear, I want plan B."
"12960420","12964820"," I definitely want plan B."
"12964920","12967340"," If I'm going to, if I'm going to eat like a pork chop or something, I'm going to smoke pork"
"12967340","12968960"," chop and a couple, pound a couple beers."
"12970100","12971800"," I want that electric assist to kick in."
"12975400","12980750"," Yeah, I think you do have to train for it. "
"12980830","12981690"," I agree with that too, Nina."
"12983170","12984570"," And I had to ask myself that."
"12984710","12986630"," I was like, I was not, I was not, not had to. "
"12986710","12987470"," I asked myself that."
"12987530","12989390"," I'm like, I'm, I'm like, I'm going to do this thing."
"12993890","12994990"," I'm like, I'm going to do this. "
"12995210","12995930"," I'm doing this trip."
"12999050","13002370"," I'm like, but there ain't no, I'm like, there's no way that I want to."
"13003710","13005710"," I don't want to spend three to five months training. "
"13006470","13008730"," I was like, I was like, I want to have fun."
"13009710","13012730"," I was like, I was like, honestly, I don't say I don't say I don't want to train."
"13012890","13015350"," Because I think the training is, you got to do the training. "
"13015730","13017150"," And it's not something you can do in a week."
"13017370","13019790"," Something that takes like one to three months minimum."
"13020410","13021170"," I would bet it takes. "
"13023190","13027190"," I bet you could time it for like nine weeks of training and be peak form."
"13028650","13030530"," If you did it every day, the twice a day."
"13032430","13033470"," You had twice a day. "
"13034470","13036450"," Nine weeks, if not three months."
"13037650","13039810"," I can be like, like right where the sweet spot is."
"13041530","13043070"," And then yeah, fuck yeah, I'd enjoy myself. "
"13043350","13043970"," I'd ride those miles."
"13044170","13044510"," It goes nothing."
"13053770","13056850"," Yeah, see, so Ryan's, Ryan's given the truth, truth right now. "
"13056850","13060770"," Ryan Morris just said, we had a bus following us at RagRi."
"13061430","13063610"," Can chill if need be and tons of bears."
"13065950","13067950"," It's like Ryan Morris is saying the truth. "
"13068270","13070550"," Like, I think that's where the YouTube video's got it wrong."
"13070810","13072330"," Like, I think you have to have it."
"13072790","13075990"," If I went with some friends, we would have our own sag wagon. "
"13077090","13079310"," And we'd have people there and we'd be like, look, here's the deal."
"13079550","13080430"," If you want to ride, you ride."
"13080650","13083890"," If you don't jump in the sack in the bus or the camper or whatever. "
"13086170","13088630"," You know, like drink when you want to drink."
"13088750","13089930"," Don't drink if you don't want to drink."
"13090170","13090690"," Here's a bike. "
"13090710","13093390"," If you want to ride, meet us in the next stop."
"13094270","13097090"," Or whatever you wake up at five a.m. by seven 30 on the road."
"13097610","13098750"," You pump out 30 miles. "
"13099830","13102650"," You get into one town and this one town's like, let's party."
"13104830","13108090"," And you want someone there to help you along."
"13108230","13108810"," I think you do it. "
"13112110","13116610"," Like some of these people on YouTube were like, I signed up for the outfitter and I just rode the"
"13116610","13117110"," whole thing."
"13117570","13121650"," And there was a couple of honest YouTubers, a couple of them were like, look, here's the deal."
"13122130","13123210"," Fucking hated this thing. "
"13123770","13125850"," And I'm like, I think you set yourself up for it."
"13126550","13128150"," Well, that set themselves up."
"13128290","13134330"," I think that they didn't realize that if you've done these things and like I've done some of this"
"13134330","13136290"," shit multiple times in the past. "
"13136990","13138410"," I'm there to have fun every time."
"13138610","13141370"," Like, wherever I go, if I'm going to go do a, if I'm going to go do a festival."
"13142210","13145010"," My number one, I'm never going to be the number one at anything like that. "
"13145150","13146630"," So I'm there to have a blast."
"13146910","13147850"," I might have fun."
"13148130","13149230"," I want to take a demo bike out. "
"13150470","13151970"," I want to have a, I want a party."
"13152950","13155890"," You know, I'm not, I'm not like overly competitive."
"13157250","13160430"," When it comes to, I was competitive skier when I was younger. "
"13161690","13163330"," But like mountain biking, surfing."
"13164550","13169390"," I'm there to like eat tacos, drink a beer, smoke a bowl out on the, on the, past the second"
"13169390","13169710"," break."
"13171450","13176010"," I don't normally smoke weed, but I will smoke weed if I'm surfing. "
"13178010","13185370"," You know, I used to compete skiing, but as an adult, fuck no, like I just, I just like to"
"13185370","13186370"," go out there and have a good day."
"13186530","13187630"," Go in the trees, hang out."
"13187630","13192180"," Have a good time. "
"13195200","13197280"," Yeah, yeah, you're not exactly, you're not getting paid."
"13207030","13208350"," Yeah, I agree with that, you know, too."
"13209630","13210790"," I agree with that, brother. "
"13214430","13219250"," Well, I still Brian saying, you know, you're not getting paid and it's fun to push yourself, but it"
"13219250","13220030"," depends on one's goals."
"13220290","13220910"," I agree with that too."
"13221470","13224870"," Like I would do, I would do this, this, this ride. "
"13226750","13230170"," But if I did the ride, like if I was like, hey, I'm not taking electric bike."
"13231430","13235690"," I'm going to do the, I'm going to do the, I'm going to go to this events, right, right"
"13235690","13236050"," specifically."
"13236630","13241310"," I'm going to use the outfit that everybody uses and I'm going to take a pedal bike with me, a"
"13241310","13242010"," road bike with me. "
"13242670","13247210"," I would have to fucking train because I would not want to show up and have a bad time."
"13249870","13252330"," And that would be that goals thing you're talking about."
"13254770","13256750"," Absolutely would be that goal thing you're talking about. "
"13257230","13260250"," And if that's all my goal, my goal is to have a good time, like jam on."
"13261210","13265310"," Do when I go to mountain bike festivals, some people shop those mountain bike festivals and they're"
"13265310","13266590"," like, I'm going to go do the spider trail."
"13266950","13270790"," I just got this demo bike cost $20,000 and I'm hardcore. "
"13271330","13272750"," I'm like, fuck yeah, have fun, bro."
"13273530","13278590"," Me, I'm like, I'll do that with my shitty, my shitty $2,000 mountain bike."
"13278590","13280170"," I have just as good as, as much fun. "
"13285700","13286980"," I saw the unicycle."
"13287560","13289540"," I saw the video of the unicycleist, bro."
"13293190","13295690"," So Duke saying he lives in Iowa has never done it. "
"13296310","13297170"," Never did it, man."
"13298850","13304790"," I would actually, if I lived in Iowa, I would be down to do like volunteer sag wagon."
"13305650","13312190"," I would, I would probably show up to just like set up in each town and help riders out. "
"13312290","13312830"," I'd do that too."
"13312930","13314290"," That sounds like a blast as well."
"13315450","13316950"," Just like not even volunteering. "
"13317010","13317710"," Just show up."
"13318610","13321350"," Bring like a hundred pounds of oranges, slice them all up."
"13322070","13324330"," Throw them in freezing or something with some dry ice. "
"13326350","13332330"," I can't hug them at them, but I think the, I think the party itself has got to be a"
"13332330","13332610"," blast."
"13337320","13342640"," And there is one, there's something else here that I haven't done."
"13342640","13347100"," I'm not from Michigan, but there's a large canoe festival here. "
"13347520","13352600"," I had plans to go last year, I think, and I got caught doing something else."
"13353480","13358560"," I ended up doing aisle of something or up north or something."
"13360280","13364740"," I had a change, a change of trip, but there's a canoe festival up here. "
"13364800","13366900"," I was going to do two this summer."
"13368280","13369620"," We pushed it to this year."
"13370080","13374300"," I think the canoe festival is this year for here and then a rag-bry for next year. "
"13374420","13380320"," So if any of you are interested in doing it, next year, think about it."
"13381340","13386880"," We'll watch some YouTube videos and we could probably go together or meet up or something."
"13393640","13395240"," Hell no, I can't ride a unicycle. "
"13398800","13400480"," I suck at unicycles."
"13406440","13410500"," Yeah, Duke's saying if you're in a town where the bikers spend the night, it's all right."
"13410640","13411600"," I bet it is, dude. "
"13414580","13417240"," Yeah, so I'm not, I'm not doing 2023."
"13419060","13420500"," I'm going to do 2024."
"13421660","13427620"," So if you're interested in doing it, I've got four people right now that are going or are"
"13427620","13430080"," tentatively going trying to talk another guy into it. "
"13432560","13438600"," I'd be interested in, if we got a large enough group, I'd be interested in renting like a shuttle"
"13438600","13439100"," or something."
"13441380","13446340"," I got a bunch of shit."
"13446500","13453680"," You guys probably have your own shit out there too, but I got the trailer and I got the bikes"
"13453680","13462100"," and I got the fucking bunch of hot chicks to go from town to town and barbecue for us. "
"13470810","13471530"," Mm hmm."
"13474890","13475990"," The coral reef Columbus."
"13476250","13476730"," They regard it. "
"13476810","13477130"," Where's that?"
"13480210","13481410"," Where's the coral reef Columbus."
"13481450","13482130"," They regard it."
"13497610","13498590"," We're going up right now. "
"13501230","13501970"," That's too far."
"13502110","13503730"," I was going to say I give you my boat to use."
"13506290","13507030"," That's in Florida. "
"13509450","13510710"," I'd say just give you my boat."
"13510870","13511290"," You can take it."
"13524650","13527690"," Yeah, group ski trips to pet park city are a blast too, aren't they?"
"13530470","13531190"," That's in Miami. "
"13538130","13540770"," Yeah, Duke saying they just want a hot shower and a place to crash."
"13541210","13542030"," I agree with that, bro."
"13547010","13547450"," Yeah. "
"13547830","13549530"," Yeah, they barbecue for us."
"13552330","13557090"," Duke saying we've had bikers spending at our place didn't even know them."
"13557350","13558190"," That's awesome, Duke. "
"13562770","13565110"," Yeah, I'd be like, I'd probably be a trail angel."
"13565570","13567270"," If I lived along the route, I'd be a trail angel."
"13567270","13569770"," I'd be like, take a shower, get inside. "
"13569930","13570430"," It's nasty."
"13570750","13571810"," Or here's my hose outside."
"13572070","13573290"," I was sprayed out with some bonfire. "
"13573970","13574570"," So blast."
"13579710","13580510"," Well, the air span."
"13580690","13582870"," Dude, maybe I should go out there, man. "
"13585090","13586410"," The air span the night this year."
"13586570","13588570"," Yeah, it's was six towns get picked."
"13589290","13590310"," It changed my every year, right?"
"13590310","13592830"," I did my research. "
"13594710","13596810"," So they picked different six different towns."
"13596890","13598910"," I think it's six different towns each year."
"13599410","13600870"," And they rotate them throughout the state. "
"13602430","13605050"," And then these towns like roll out the red carpet."
"13605930","13606690"," Like they really do."
"13606790","13607330"," It's kind of cool. "
"13609090","13610490"," And it's more than kind of cool."
"13610630","13611090"," It's really cool."
"13611210","13612910"," That's why it's part of the. "
"13616170","13617510"," The glamour of all this."
"13617510","13619210"," Like what there was one video I watched."
"13620850","13621990"," Where a guy was like. "
"13622990","13625710"," This town has 250 or 350 residents."
"13627110","13630770"," I think he I think he quoted like he said 1500 and then he put a."
"13631550","13635630"," A correction in text on the video and said 250 or something."
"13636370","13640150"," And he was like 18,000 people rolled through the town. "
"13641330","13645450"," And this town had like pulled out the spread like the red carpet came out."
"13646290","13647370"," For all these people."
"13647630","13650870"," So it's going to be kind of a crazy thing if you're from a small town. "
"13652650","13656250"," And so I think that would be a blast like going to small town."
"13656250","13656850"," Have a blast."
"13657430","13658230"," Hang out the locals. "
"13670310","13671610"," Top us chicks on boats."
"13679470","13682090"," Two cities storm like Carol Ames Des Moines."
"13683290","13684070"," Damn, it's Lido. "
"13684330","13684690"," Coralville."
"13684870","13685050"," Oh, yeah."
"13685190","13686130"," Coralville and I live in Des Moines. "
"13687130","13688010"," Well, it'll be a blast."
"13693170","13695630"," You're taking a long ass road trip fetching your boat from Atlanta."
"13696550","13696750"," Oh, Nina. "
"13696990","13697290"," You should go."
"13697530","13698610"," Nina, you should, um."
"13701430","13702950"," Hook up with Joe Harper. "
"13704790","13706290"," He's outside of Atlanta, bro."
"13707350","13708970"," Hook up with Joe Harper."
"13709150","13709850"," Look up Joe Donut. "
"13712250","13713450"," They'll take you out in his boat."
"13720730","13721410"," Yeah, it is."
"13721590","13724850"," So look, there's some good videos out there. "
"13725050","13728770"," If you guys have never been a herd of that race in Iowa, it's the largest."
"13729870","13730910"," No, it's not a race."
"13731690","13734910"," It's the, I believe it's the longest, largest. "
"13737190","13741150"," Bike ride and I think in the United States, it could be wrong in this, but I think it's the"
"13741150","13743850"," longest, largest bike ride in the United States."
"13746130","13747950"," I think it's 18,000 riders."
"13750190","13752770"," Oh, look at that big green bar right there. "
"13770110","13772770"," All right, I'm going to take one more stab at this right now."
"13774150","13776870"," Oh, there's a big volume bar right here right now."
"13777150","13778250"," So I'm long calls again. "
"13779410","13780630"," Pretty risky here."
"13783170","13786610"," Not the right time for me to be doing this one 14 in the afternoon."
"13787510","13790970"," Lot of buyers on the one minute candle right there. "
"13793190","13794870"," Big volume bar right here."
"13801750","13803210"," Probably shouldn't have taken that trade."
"13805350","13806950"," Let me check on VIX real quick. "
"13807210","13808950"," I think I might have, yeah, maybe."
"13811730","13813050"," Probably shouldn't have taken that trade."
"13813230","13815230"," Probably going to get torched in this trade. "
"13816690","13817590"," I have to add more."
"13819930","13824790"," VIX trading 1576 right now in a death spiral."
"13831740","13833780"," VIX trading below $16. "
"13838040","13839080"," 1576 here."
"13841480","13843380"," I think I should get out of this trade."
"13844840","13846320"," I think I fucked up on this trade. "
"13846900","13849720"," I bought based on this volume bar right here."
"13858060","13859720"," I think I'm going to get hurt on this trade."
"13859980","13860640"," I'm not sure yet. "
"13863980","13865000"," Someone just bought."
"13867920","13868780"," See it right there."
"13875200","13877800"," A million volume on the one minute chart right there. "
"13885570","13887950"," So for the VIX to make a vote plan it needs to get above."
"13888650","13889430"," Let me look closer."
"13897110","13899170"," Yeah, I see what you're saying there in the VIX. "
"13899290","13900230"," I'm watching right now, brother."
"13902810","13904290"," I'm watching the VIX with you."
"13904730","13905750"," I'm going to get out right now. "
"13908110","13909270"," All right, I'm flat again."
"13910930","13912630"," I see what you're saying on that VIX."
"13912890","13915770"," VIX now trading 1577 on a double bottom. "
"13916190","13917750"," Trying to make a cross here."
"13921030","13927450"," I should have stayed in that fucking trade."
"13932770","13934590"," This is the second time today. "
"13947480","13948620"," Careful of a swift river."
"13948880","13950180"," I want you to be careful out there."
"13950940","13952420"," That doesn't mean it's going to happen. "
"13953100","13957060"," You could see like the squeeze higher and then a quick reversal here."
"13957660","13959620"," I'm not believing this is going to happen."
"13960960","13962820"," Watch to see that green bar down there. "
"13962940","13964700"," Big giant buyers down here."
"13966960","13968680"," Normally they like that stuff to print."
"13969980","13971160"," But who made that comment?"
"13972180","13978660"," I don't know who said that comment, but someone just said there's a big giant bull playing in VIX. "
"13978880","13979520"," I agree with that."
"13979620","13980720"," It hasn't shown itself yet."
"13982240","13983140"," But I agree. "
"13984220","13986800"," It's too risky for me to be in a trade right here."
"13986840","13987460"," I'm going to show it to you."
"13988080","13990060"," The bull playing that he's talking about is right here. "
"13992400","13994920"," There's a one minute chart on the VIXI baby."
"13996520","14000300"," And this trader just mentioned this in the chat."
"14001160","14002880"," What he's saying to you is that. "
"14015070","14019270"," Pixel starts squeezing up here and that would lead to a reversal."
"14022330","14024310"," On the spy, a swift reversal."
"14024830","14029670"," Now my take here personally is that we're going to bloodbath this shit down. "
"14031270","14032770"," That's my take now."
"14033570","14034290"," Staying that."
"14036390","14038690"," We're going to get some violent moves here likely. "
"14039510","14042350"," The reason why I think it's going up is because of these buyers here."
"14042470","14043670"," You see, not always."
"14044550","14047630"," A lot of times when you see that stuff down there, you see that green bar down there. "
"14048990","14050070"," They want that to print."
"14050850","14053350"," So, I'm just going to stay flat here."
"14054590","14056650"," It wasn't paying attention to take that trade. "
"14058150","14060270"," I want to respect what that trader said inside the chat."
"14061990","14063650"," And just sit in my hands here."
"14065610","14068270"," We know the sellers got over and earlier, so get rid of that. "
"14069470","14074150"," We know that the buyers, let's look on spy real quick."
"14078090","14079670"," Now these are the buyers right here."
"14081370","14083490"," The buyers do not want to give this up. "
"14086930","14090330"," The next buyers are down below at the 41680."
"14091990","14094990"," A five-minute chart here."
"14102740","14103860"," The 41676. "
"14107520","14110180"," Get on the wrong place down here."
"14113100","14114960"," Whoever said that in chat, thank you."
"14114980","14117320"," I would have gotten ripped up in that trade. "
"14121650","14122530"," Thanks for saying so."
"14122670","14123950"," Who said that in chat?"
"14125370","14126050"," Who said that in chat?"
"14126050","14126410"," Who said that in chat?"
"14131700","14132940"," Who just said that in chat?"
"14143470","14145350"," Who told me in chat not to take that trade?"
"14147650","14149990"," Someone just saved my ass in the chat."
"14150170","14151850"," I don't know who it was. "
"14152110","14159650"," I don't know who did that."
"14159830","14161070"," Someone said something in chat to me."
"14161210","14162890"," I entered a trade back here and got out of it. "
"14168330","14169330"," It was you future trader."
"14169610","14169870"," Thanks, brother."
"14170050","14170570"," Appreciate it. "
"14172070","14173090"," And you're a vet too."
"14173290","14173730"," Right on, brother."
"14176790","14177470"," Hell yeah, man. "
"14177610","14182690"," Thank you."
"14186910","14188890"," You guys are like hawks out there."
"14190510","14192910"," You guys are like super hawks out there. "
"14196630","14198270"," Straight super hawks."
"14205080","14206920"," Yeah, I don't want anything to do with this."
"14208120","14208680"," Okay. "
"14210780","14212480"," I don't care if we do squeeze here."
"14214300","14215420"," Very risky."
"14215720","14216520"," This is very risky. "
"14217340","14219340"," Let me, let me, let me, let me, let me."
"14221060","14223700"," Take the way to describe where we are right now at this moment."
"14224740","14225920"," Is we could go either way. "
"14229330","14231570"," We could squeeze like moon squeeze this."
"14232850","14235730"," Or bloodbath it and I can't call it."
"14235930","14237330"," So on stream at least. "
"14239450","14241670"," The one thing bulls have going from is this bug."
"14241830","14244210"," This buy right here is volume by you can see it right there."
"14244690","14245870"," See that volume bar. "
"14246550","14249890"," It's on the 13, it's on the 113 minute."
"14252690","14254330"," There was a million shares bought."
"14255270","14256250"," I think we go up here. "
"14256990","14258250"," But on stream to risky."
"14259070","14260770"," If this reversed on me, it'd be my own fault."
"14271210","14274230"," Our two right here for 1894. "
"14276610","14278350"," I can't call this right now."
"14278690","14280210"," And I am in agreement with the bull."
"14280630","14282810"," The bull plane on VIX. "
"14283530","14284650"," Let me look around the market."
"14284650","14285810"," I'm going to look at HYG."
"14285990","14286690"," Yeah, you guys are right. "
"14286810","14288070"," I'm going to go look at HYG and shit."
"14291610","14292970"," HYG looking bullish, man."
"14297850","14299030"," It might be going up. "
"14299130","14301070"," We may have an ass blaster here."
"14309110","14311250"," HYG is on a one, two."
"14313630","14314350"," Two trigger. "
"14316810","14317730"," HYG is bullish."
"14317730","14322430"," Although there's some daily bearish divergence coming down on it."
"14322970","14324330"," It's tough when to call here, man. "
"14325310","14326970"," HYG is hard to read."
"14327250","14329190"," There's a giant gap to fill an HYG above."
"14329670","14331510"," HYG divergence, of course. "
"14334870","14336750"," It's showing the higher rate increases."
"14339370","14341250"," HYG pricing in this morning."
"14342290","14343490"," Higher rates on Wednesday. "
"14346250","14347410"," What's XLF doing?"
"14350890","14354790"," XLF has a gap to fill down below at 33 in change."
"14357090","14358210"," Let's look at the Dixie."
"14363050","14363770"," Oh, dude. "
"14364050","14365050"," Dixie's going to crash here."
"14365190","14366070"," This is a hard one to call."
"14373090","14375630"," Dixie priced in a rate increase on Wednesday. "
"14377910","14379890"," This is a hard one to call."
"14384390","14386590"," Dixie is bullish here, not bearish."
"14391810","14392890"," Dixie is bullish here. "
"14393050","14395770"," It's looking for some consolidation for the arrow to come back up to it."
"14397990","14399410"," Let me look at it on the 30 minute."
"14401650","14402530"," That's tough, man. "
"14411690","14413410"," Let's look around the market together as a group."
"14416110","14418410"," A lot of conflicting signals right now."
"14426470","14427190"," So Dixie. "
"14429230","14431030"," Dixie, Dixie, Dixie, Dixie, Dixie."
"14431910","14433190"," Let's go on the market together."
"14434210","14434950"," We can go up here. "
"14438470","14440430"," Dixie, bottom of bearishness."
"14442010","14443230"," Getting more bullish."
"14446410","14447130"," Harley, not so much. "
"14447470","14448130"," Five minute, man."
"14453650","14457670"," It's a 30 minute chart right now, but a 30 minute chart is saying bullish on Dixie."
"14460390","14462890"," Another bad thing for bulls here. "
"14463730","14470610"," Dixie doesn't necessarily have to show what's coming, but volatility sounds up here."
"14470750","14476510"," You can see the vol has been suppressed on the hourly, right?"
"14477330","14483970"," Bears really want to get above the daily trigger and have the hourly come up and meet it."
"14484270","14486450"," So just looking closely here together. "
"14490780","14492640"," On Dixie right now, right?"
"14493640","14496680"," Dixie to get bullish needs the hourly to come up."
"14499340","14500920"," And then price."
"14503620","14508120"," This could mean up currently for spy, but a big roll over at some point. "
"14508700","14509580"," You see that?"
"14509820","14517460"," So price comes down in Dixie to like 101.90. You know, I think this is one o'clock tomorrow"
"14517460","14517960"," afternoon."
"14517960","14521260"," You get the bloodbath at like one o'clock, and that's where Dixie starts to launch."
"14522160","14523360"," It's just on this timeframe. "
"14524540","14527040"," I'm not necessarily bearish on spy at the moment."
"14529560","14531120"," Let's see it much better here."
"14534300","14537000"," You're waiting for the hourly to come up to give you a hand. "
"14537160","14542700"," If you're a Dixie bull, you want the hourly to come up, you want it to cross the daily."
"14543540","14545540"," You want price to stay above here."
"14546420","14547860"," Consolidate in the face. "
"14548100","14550600"," That's what rolls the spy over."
"14553300","14553620"," HYG."
"14558160","14562030"," This is kind of similar. "
"14564610","14567130"," HYG has the hourly rolling over on it."
"14570430","14579850"," If price can get above the HYG, which show the way higher for the spy, but right now the HYG"
"14579850","14580550"," is being sent."
"14581790","14587010"," Sending lower and it's on a major, like emotional area here. "
"14588170","14595670"," All right, we want to three, four, five, one, two, three, four, five, five trigger combination HYG."
"14602060","14603260"," Bearish on the daily."
"14605300","14606340"," Bullish on the hourly. "
"14607780","14609860"," So not really a good read there."
"14613520","14614940"," Vix bloodbathing once again."
"14616960","14626860"," But even though it bloodbath, if you look at it on a one minute chart, there's your"
"14626860","14627920"," bullish cross on it. "
"14628080","14629380"," See it right there."
"14630860","14635140"," So price is now above 1577."
"14646870","14648330"," Conflicting messages for sure. "
"14655730","14657190"," Dangerous bull or bear."
"14657470","14659190"," I don't care where it goes up or down."
"14659290","14659930"," I haven't looked right now. "
"14660050","14663990"," I'm not looking at the spy chart, but just looking around the market."
"14667540","14668880"," Just looking around the market."
"14669880","14671180"," Just this moment. "
"14671180","14676360"," I don't know if I care if you're bullish or bearish here."
"14677320","14677880"," Necessarily."
"14681360","14683040"," Right now I'm grateful not in calls. "
"14687160","14690110"," But five minute chart."
"14696730","14718560"," All I"
"14718560","14724300"," can think about right now, the only thing this makes me think of is fucking bears are like."
"14724300","14727840"," Oh, I put place my put spreads. "
"14727920","14729040"," I'm closing my laptop."
"14730200","14734220"," And all I'm thinking about is, yeah, we get there and then we put the put spreads on."
"14735800","14738100"," I think if you're a bear, it doesn't matter if you do it. "
"14738140","14740700"," If you do it somewhere in here and you just close your laptop for the day."
"14742440","14743420"," I don't think it matters."
"14746360","14748360"," But is there risk of a squeeze higher here?"
"14748660","14749200"," Most definitely. "
"14755310","14756390"," You can see it right here."
"14758330","14760590"," You can actually see the volume bar right there too."
"14762250","14763350"," Let's see it right there. "
"14765350","14767290"," In the five minute chart they bought."
"14770630","14771730"," One point two."
"14772850","14774990"," Five minute chart says it was one point two million. "
"14776890","14778430"," But they did it all in a one minute."
"14779470","14781030"," They didn't do it actually in the five minute."
"14781130","14781770"," They did it on the one minute. "
"14791890","14793730"," And Dixie's rolling over right now."
"14805210","14809430"," Yeah, it's a good thing I ditched him, but I don't think that bears are in charge right now either."
"14810970","14812090"," I think it'd go either way. "
"14812270","14812990"," It can make a call."
"14814590","14821210"," If you just try to saying a rut just confirmed a bear plane."
"14822990","14824550"," Yeah, I think we'll see aggressive selling. "
"14825510","14826310"," I just don't know if it's today."
"14834530","14837270"," I am in agreement with what bears are saying here."
"14837490","14839890"," Like I'm not disagreeing with what bears are saying at all. "
"14841490","14846410"," If I wasn't streaming, I would put on some put spreads and close my laptop."
"14848870","14849790"," That's what I would do."
"14849910","14850690"," I wouldn't day trade this. "
"14851730","14854890"," And I'm not going to trade this here."
"14856090","14861450"," I'm not going to day trade this bear or bull at the moment."
"14861730","14864630"," Like it's just like zero date puts or zero date calls for me. "
"14865410","14867850"," I think this is you'll easily get trapped in here."
"14867850","14871470"," And on either, I think the probability of you getting trapped bull or bear is high."
"14872530","14874870"," Maybe a straddle or a strangle. "
"14875830","14877490"," Or at least on a day trading basis."
"14879150","14880310"," It's hard to call here."
"14881210","14882250"," I like easy setups. "
"14882530","14883450"," This isn't an easy setup."
"14890060","14891340"," Yeah, Jimmy, I agree."
"14894500","14895720"," I agree, Jimmy. "
"14897980","14899180"," All right, I don't think it's Wednesday."
"14899520","14900420"," I don't think Wednesday is it?"
"14900580","14902740"," Usually I thought tell me if I'm wrong."
"14905080","14908100"," When we're ever going to rate decision, I always feel like it's. "
"14910700","14916720"," I always feel like rate decisions are like we trade up into Tuesday."
"14918840","14920220"," Like middle of the afternoon."
"14921220","14923820"," And it looks all bullish as fuck and then they rug pull it. "
"14924340","14925420"," Am I wrong on that?"
"14928100","14929240"," I could be wrong on that."
"14930380","14931680"," Maybe they do it a day early."
"14938500","14940080"," Why is FRC not climbing?"
"14940300","14941760"," FRC, man, that shit is suspended. "
"14942380","14943780"," They're not going to spend that."
"14944360","14945880"," All the common shares are gone right now."
"14956650","14959470"," Getting it happily on Thursday as well. "
"14966010","14967470"," How is Tesla looking?"
"14968710","14972650"," Yeah, the FRC wagon is dead."
"14974730","14976430"," Chris Plummer was asking about that."
"14979730","14980590"," Let's look at Tesla. "
"14982210","14984010"," There's this weird thing with Tesla too."
"14985690","14987390"," You guys want to see some coolness on Tesla?"
"14988970","14990530"," Tesla's looking bullish as fuck here."
"14991210","14992630"," Extremely bullish right now on Tesla. "
"14993850","14997030"," Tesla has a one, two, three, and four."
"14997110","14999570"," One, two, three, four trigger."
"15001390","15003230"," Tesla's looking extremely bullish here. "
"15004710","15005990"," Trading one, six, two, thirteen."
"15007210","15008670"," I'm bullish on Tesla here."
"15009050","15011190"," You want to know trading like a meme stock stock. "
"15013510","15020910"," I was having a conversation with a friend that over the past week and a half, two weeks."
"15020910","15028350"," Tesla bull that I've been longtime friends with and I was talking to him about."
"15031570","15033390"," I didn't actually part of this conversation. "
"15033390","15046500"," I haven't been able to have with him years of yet, but I used"
"15046500","15050020"," to, I used to really like trading Tesla."
"15052280","15055160"," Well, let's start with this."
"15058220","15061320"," I'm no longer a fan of Elon Musk. "
"15063140","15064860"," And a lot of you are, but I am not."
"15067640","15069720"," He needs to put CEOs on his companies."
"15070840","15072280"," I'll leave it to simply. "
"15073380","15083140"," With that said though, over the years, it's become very, uh, the"
"15083140","15083940"," Tesla gang."
"15086020","15089020"," Uh, has, has, has."
"15090680","15093580"," Uh, but at least for me, I can't do it anymore. "
"15094920","15097440"," I'm a, and I'm still a huge Tesla bull."
"15097660","15098080"," Like I am."
"15099160","15100140"," Tesla bull all day long. "
"15102180","15108220"," Uh, but the fact that I can't differentiate between all of this, uh, and have normal conversations"
"15108220","15109600"," with people is a problem."
"15111060","15111860"," Major problem."
"15114160","15121120"," Uh, being able to decipher him, where it stood out, where it stood out for me last week was the"
"15121120","15122100"," SpaceX launch. "
"15122720","15128500"," You used to be able to have great conversations about SpaceX and you can't do that anymore either."
"15128940","15134800"," So Tesla gang is now, uh, where up until even maybe a few years ago, you could have great"
"15134800","15136300"," conversations about SpaceX."
"15137500","15138040"," Impossible. "
"15138580","15140220"," You're just like, I don't know if it's bots."
"15140920","15142440"," A mixture of bots."
"15142720","15143520"," I'm telling you. "
"15143920","15144980"," Like fucking bots."
"15146020","15151560"," And then human beings that are, uh, then like parroting with the bots say."
"15153660","15155100"," It's just, it's out of control. "
"15155540","15158020"," And so now I'm not enjoying SpaceX anymore."
"15158160","15159120"," That's pissing me off too."
"15159140","15160440"," And I'm a huge SpaceX fan. "
"15161140","15170980"," Uh, but with all that said, my expectations are high for Tesla and, uh,"
"15172300","15177880"," I was unimpressed with this, this earnings, uh, on a very high, a very high level."
"15180600","15184380"," I may view Tesla should go to on this earnings."
"15185320","15192940"," Tesla should go down to the 60s, at least saying that. "
"15194640","15203200"," I have an easy time differentiating what I want and what the truth is likely."
"15204760","15208100"," And the only fly in that ointment that I can see."
"15209020","15210060"," Is twofold. "
"15211000","15211340"," The."
"15213880","15215360"," The, um."
"15216700","15217100"," Come on. "
"15217200","15221120"," Let me get this out for you so you can see where those buy if there are even buyers there."
"15221300","15227140"," My one fly in the ointment with Tesla or not one fly in the ointment with making that statement."
"15228460","15233000"," My one fly in the ointment is, uh, the LA waivers are like, fuck no, bro. "
"15233000","15233880"," We're still going to 300."
"15234440","15235560"," I'm like, they're right."
"15235820","15239080"," Or at least what they're, what they, what they're charting is right. "
"15240140","15245180"," The, the only other fly in that ointment too, is if you go on a quarterly chart."
"15246260","15247160"," Uh, for Tesla."
"15247880","15250820"," This is where they make a market no matter what. "
"15250820","15258540"," This is when the argument of, uh, like market makers will make a market of anything."
"15258900","15260320"," They don't care what you think about it."
"15260580","15261820"," They're like fraud and shit. "
"15263860","15264900"," Uh, can be bad."
"15267400","15268700"," I'm looking at Tesla right now."
"15268700","15268980"," Hold on. "
"15269940","15271140"," Let's see if that shows on this chart."
"15271720","15271740"," Yeah."
"15274220","15275340"," I can show this chart. "
"15276840","15283300"," Um, the problem with like Tesla, forget about just don't make it's words of me about Tesla and"
"15283300","15284100"," fraud and all that shit."
"15284200","15286660"," I'm talking about a fucking stock that's going to trade."
"15287140","15289100"," The problem that I got with going to 65. "
"15290640","15293420"," Isn't, uh, my view on their earnings."
"15294260","15297660"," Uh, it, it doesn't even sit with the."
"15298740","15299340"," View on. "
"15301080","15302640"," Um, LA waivers."
"15303500","15313240"," It's, it rests on the fact that, uh, Q one, the accumulation of Tesla and Q"
"15313240","15315840"," one was on fucking real."
"15317200","15321520"," If you look at the volume bars on Tesla and Q one, it was insane. "
"15323260","15329040"," Like it was, it was one of the most, um, it was, it was the highest accumulation that's been done"
"15329040","15329560"," on Tesla."
"15330160","15331300"," And it's history."
"15334020","15339040"," And when I see that, and I'm like, Tesla should be fucking repriced. "
"15339440","15341760"," Like in my view, Tesla needs repriced."
"15343120","15343860"," It needs repriced."
"15345440","15348340"," Until we get some deliverables saying that though. "
"15349200","15356740"," I can't deny that that shit got bought and not only did it get bought, they fucking bought all of"
"15356740","15356860"," it."
"15356860","15360860"," And these aren't bots and they're not Tesla gang."
"15361560","15362840"," Uh, these are institutions. "
"15363080","15363940"," These are market makers."
"15364400","15365040"," They bought Tesla."
"15365900","15372240"," And so, uh, when I start to say it should go to 65 and I'm like, these fuck, I mean,"
"15372320","15373740"," these fucking guys own Tesla. "
"15374420","15375700"," Like market makers own Tesla."
"15376360","15378720"," Not, I'm not even talking about Kathy Woods."
"15379620","15382580"," Talking about like fucking banks own Tesla. "
"15382580","15384760"," Like buy the bushel load."
"15386320","15391560"," The only way that they're going to sell into each other is during panic."
"15393140","15400060"," And unless you have panic, whatever I say to you about like, hey, Tesla should be repriced or, uh,"
"15400420","15405940"," I didn't like their earnings or Tesla, Tesla owes me a truck and Tesla owes me a full line of"
"15405940","15406180"," cars. "
"15406180","15410720"," And fuck that is me not liking Elon doesn't matter."
"15411800","15413740"," I mean, liking Tesla doesn't matter."
"15414340","15416680"," What does matter is that it was bought. "
"15417340","15418740"," It was bought hand over fist."
"15420040","15424120"," Uh, like insane, even though price is lower right now."
"15424760","15427580"," It was at 162 starting to squeeze right now. "
"15431520","15433940"," Um, if, if market makers buy that shit."
"15434860","15438620"," If it wasn't us buying it, if it wasn't bulls buying it, well, they had a nice squeeze right there."
"15439200","15440580"," It's not bulls buying it. "
"15440700","15446120"," If it's not, uh, Tesla bulls or I don't fucking know, Kathy would, whoever, it's like institutions"
"15446120","15446680"," buying it."
"15447300","15448820"," The only way, the only way they're selling it."
"15449800","15452780"," If they did the buying, they're not selling it until they make their money. "
"15454340","15456420"," And, uh, I bought it a hundred and thirty bucks."
"15456840","15462720"," So, uh, go into 216, 2017, whatever that is, not enough for a market maker."
"15463140","15465620"," They're like, they want it probably 300%. "
"15467160","15469180"," So they want 300 if they're a market maker."
"15472060","15476440"," So, even though in my head, I'm like, yeah, I want to see six, five bucks."
"15477900","15479760"," I think these fucking market makers want to see 300. "
"15480420","15482480"," Uh, my view."
"15483580","15486960"," Look at that nice squeeze on the spy right now trading 417, 16."
"15489320","15492860"," So that's the fly in the ointment for me with Tesla. "
"15501100","15504040"," Yeah, I didn't, I didn't watch the interview or refuse to watch it."
"15504380","15507560"," Uh, I haven't, uh, the past week, there's been a few interviews."
"15508140","15510900"," I've heard that he was doing the interview. "
"15511140","15512240"," I was like, I'm not listening to it."
"15512240","15521500"," Uh, I read, I read briefly about removing, um, paid leave for parents at Twitter."
"15521720","15526000"," I read something about Twitter being moved to Florida or Texas Twitter HQ. "
"15526260","15527820"," I care less right now at this point."
"15528580","15534260"," Uh, when I took my vacation, I realized mentally my health is better."
"15535380","15537260"," Just not paying attention to Elon. "
"15538760","15541560"," Uh, not reading anything about Elon and anything that he's doing."
"15541560","15542820"," I don't want, I don't care about it."
"15544520","15546180"," No, I don't, I can't. "
"15547320","15556980"," And Tesla gang is doing no, we're Tesla gang used to be productive"
"15556980","15557620"," for Tesla."
"15559000","15560160"," They're becoming a part of the problem."
"15560820","15561220"," My view. "
"15563960","15564880"," This isn't you."
"15565080","15569440"," If you're a Tesla gang person listening to this right now, this is not towards you specifically."
"15572480","15575460"," Uh, I'm not being specific, like I don't like you or anything like that. "
"15575580","15576140"," I still like you."
"15576380","15579400"," You know, Tesla gang that I know out there, social media love all you guys."
"15584860","15586620"," My, my thought is that it's bots. "
"15590220","15592960"," I can see it infecting SpaceX now."
"15594860","15598260"," Any conversation I used to be able to converse about SpaceX."
"15600780","15602980"," Have productive conversations. "
"15604640","15606260"," Learn a lot about SpaceX."
"15608900","15612680"," And this right now with SpaceX first time."
"15613940","15615780"," It's just nonstop garbage now. "
"15616400","15620100"," It's just like, it's just like a bunch of bots screaming at you all day long."
"15620100","15622580"," No matter what you ask, no matter what you want to talk about."
"15623360","15625400"," Uh, open any conversations and that stuff. "
"15625540","15627640"," It's just, it's just pure rage, like rage everywhere."
"15628280","15630880"," I'm assuming that it's, uh, bots."
"15641500","15642640"," Yeah, I can't do it anymore. "
"15643280","15644280"," I can't do it."
"15644360","15644860"," I can't."
"15645020","15646760"," They totally can't. "
"15647980","15654620"," Even Twitter, like Twitter, uh, trying to figure out a way, uh, to have a Twitter presence."
"15655900","15656700"," That's not real."
"15656860","15658260"," It's presence, but it's not real presence. "
"15658380","15659860"," My effect would have been, uh, writing."
"15660860","15663840"," I've been writing the week that I took off here and writing briefs every morning."
"15665480","15667520"," Uh, and I want to start publishing them. "
"15668180","15669580"," So that's my Twitter presence."
"15669860","15673340"," Just like a daily brief in the morning and then possibly a weekly review or something."
"15673960","15675060"," That'd be the end of my Twitter. "
"15675860","15677060"," Well, I'll be on Twitter, but it's not."
"15677660","15682480"," Not present in arguing or reading the stuff that I've been reading in the past month or two, two"
"15682480","15682660"," months."
"15683200","15685360"," This isn't like a Republican Democrat thing either. "
"15686320","15687420"," It's not political at all."
"15689580","15690540"," Let me say ethical."
"15698990","15699350"," Yeah. "
"15699470","15703530"," See, I was able to, uh, some of that shit I was able to let slide."
"15703790","15704210"," Oh, that slide."
"15704210","15708410"," But I was like, yeah, I was like, I was fine with the crazy lawn. "
"15709450","15710570"," I had no problem with crazy."
"15710790","15711630"," I figured he would be crazy."
"15711870","15714270"," I mean, you know, like all that stuff I was fine with. "
"15714270","15720310"," I think the social media, I don't know if it's a social media or wasting his time."
"15720330","15721650"," My view on social media."
"15722510","15724890"," Uh, I was, I was fine. "
"15725290","15728050"," It's hard for me to explain my take on a lawn."
"15728230","15741370"," Like, like, as long as he was working on SpaceX and he was working on Tesla and, um, I"
"15741370","15742150"," was good."
"15742770","15743610"," I didn't care. "
"15746710","15749690"," Like the whole social media thing and like, I just can't do it."
"15749850","15750530"," It can't."
"15750790","15751850"," Now he's working on AI. "
"15752210","15755070"," I'm like, I feel like he kind of could be wrong on this."
"15757350","15758850"," I could be wrong on this."
"15761670","15766050"," It's like, it's maybe someone who was smart said, Hey, you're going to lose the race to Mars before"
"15766050","15767190"," AI takes over. "
"15767610","15770070"," And so you might as well just cash in now and make a bunch of money."
"15771810","15773870"," Power and try to try to try to survive."
"15774310","15774670"," Maybe. "
"15775010","15778510"," I don't know if any guys, some of you guys probably know what I'm talking about."
"15778550","15779270"," Some of you guys probably don't."
"15788510","15789430"," Oh, dude, winky. "
"15789810","15792630"," So some things I can't talk about here."
"15792950","15793650"," I got to talk to you."
"15793730","15794490"," I got to tell you some winky. "
"15795570","15798090"," I was able to, uh, I'll tell you guys something."
"15798210","15799190"," You guys want to know something cool?"
"15800610","15801330"," I can't."
"15801370","15802710"," I can't divulge this, but. "
"15805170","15806410"," I have a friend."
"15808130","15809810"," Who's able to see."
"15811430","15814390"," Everyone on Twitter's, uh, alt accounts. "
"15815690","15817550"," And not just their alt accounts."
"15818810","15822030"," They're able to see their debt accounts."
"15822710","15827310"," So if you had an account and you deleted it, they can see that it's you if you have a"
"15827310","15827910"," new account. "
"15829510","15832910"," And so we went through looking at some famous."
"15833810","15835130"," Twitter users."
"15835930","15839670"," And we found their public alt accounts. "
"15841610","15844210"," And we found their debt accounts too."
"15847130","15848470"," I'll talk to winky."
"15848610","15851250"," I'll give you a call or text message later about that. "
"15857150","15858850"," Yeah, there's still a."
"15864240","15867040"," We were looking at some people and we're like this fucking."
"15867280","15872460"," We're like, we're like, if people knew who these, who their alts were."
"15875220","15877180"," So you're able to see people's alt accounts. "
"15877840","15881040"," You're able to see a concept they've deleted."
"15881580","15882400"," All kinds of shit."
"15885140","15886300"," You can see what Elon. "
"15886300","15887920"," Elon will comment on stuff."
"15888240","15890840"," If it's really fucking bizarre on alt accounts."
"15903970","15904750"," Yeah, we do. "
"15904990","15905410"," I don't."
"15905650","15909530"," Some of the things that I saw this week, I was like, not making that public."
"15910170","15911570"," I'm not talking about this. "
"15912610","15914410"," I'm like, I'm not naming names out there."
"15917590","15918690"," I'll just keep that."
"15919010","15924830"," It's kind of like you when you find something that you're not supposed to know. "
"15924830","15926570"," Let's keep that to myself."
"15933510","15940770"," We found out they never deleted accounts when they got hacked and had to tell people that deleted"
"15940770","15941710"," accounts got hacked."
"15942190","15942710"," No shit. "
"15949510","15950770"," Yeah, exactly right."
"15951150","15953990"," When you find out your neighbor is banging the UPS driver, mom is the word."
"15953990","15954390"," I agree. "
"15956090","15959330"," Some of the shit I saw was like, I'm not saying anything."
"15959950","15961130"," I'm like, I'm not saying a word."
"15963990","15965230"," Because it was like, I'm not that person. "
"15965450","15966390"," You don't know what you're talking about."
"15966570","15967470"," You're like, Hey, what about this?"
"15967650","15971210"," They're like, you're just cutting paste and I'm like, okay, I'm not."
"15971330","15973070"," I was like, I was like, I'm not going to say anything. "
"15975570","15976650"," Mine your own business."
"15977110","15977450"," The greed."
"15979570","15980870"," That's how totally I felt. "
"15991270","15993590"," Yeah, dude, I saw that shit too."
"15993590","15994970"," I saw that outside of that."
"15996670","15998510"," I saw some really creepy shit. "
"15998710","16002910"," All I want to see is like, Neuralink be worked on."
"16005490","16008930"," I want to see like, I want to see the focus on Tesla."
"16009530","16010610"," I want to see the focus on SpaceX. "
"16011330","16011910"," That's all I want to see."
"16012070","16012710"," I don't care about Twitter."
"16013510","16014930"," Only I do, but I don't care"
"16014930","16023570"," about it. "
"16031570","16039390"," This is more like security stuff and this is not his politics and this is like technical stuff."
"16043570","16044550"," Yeah, I agree with that."
"16055660","16060200"," Yeah, your old account got censored by, I thought Elon gave a blanket reprieve. "
"16060400","16061320"," You might want to go back and check."
"16061540","16066200"," I thought that Elon reprieved everyone's sensor to count."
"16078040","16080080"," This is just eating up right now. "
"16080380","16081840"," Spy is just tearing apart."
"16088760","16091220"," Yeah, be careful with the M&T material."
"16092920","16093780"," Careful with that. "
"16094040","16094940"," M&P."
"16095120","16096200"," Yeah, totally man."
"16096960","16098400"," Like that's what I was like. "
"16102260","16103060"," They were gaming."
"16103280","16105960"," Someone did say on Twitter that they were still shadow band."
"16107040","16113860"," The blanket reprieve only applied to very high public accounts. "
"16114640","16116400"," It didn't actually apply to everybody."
"16116520","16118500"," I've been told that elsewhere too."
"16119060","16120360"," It doesn't apply to everyone's account. "
"16133870","16134770"," Yeah, so whatever."
"16135030","16139850"," So anyways, so for me right now, I'm kind of pissed at Elon."
"16140150","16142450"," Most of my upset this with Elon is like, there's no truck. "
"16142950","16144710"," Like, there's no fucking truck."
"16144710","16147510"," I wanted not just one truck."
"16147730","16149490"," I wanted like the cool Cybertruck. "
"16149790","16153310"," And then I wanted like an F-150 or a Mazda B-2000 or something."
"16154250","16155350"," I wanted an SUV."
"16156790","16158670"," I want those things hands down. "
"16159750","16162050"," I wanted a FSD to have LIDAR."
"16162270","16168330"," I wanted FSD and LIDAR to be a statesman and get it passed a lot all over the country."
"16168570","16169470"," Like that shit's not happening. "
"16170090","16173430"," Like I have material things about Tesla that have not happened at this point."
"16174190","16176990"," I was appreciative of lowing prices."
"16177870","16178750"," I like that. "
"16179010","16181090"," Believe it or not, I was a proponent of that."
"16181930","16184890"," But there's just some material things that have not happened yet for me."
"16186490","16188170"," Promises that have been made that have been fulfilled. "
"16188670","16189710"," There's no argument there."
"16189850","16191490"," There's no fucking Cybertruck on the road."
"16192150","16193290"," So I ate issues with that. "
"16194130","16195730"," That shit to me is all priced in."
"16196430","16199170"," So if it's not done, it's not out there and happening, I get a problem."
"16199770","16200550"," SpaceX, Starlink. "
"16201390","16202170"," I'm not Starlink."
"16202290","16204130"," Starlink's done a great job."
"16204330","16208090"," SpaceX has been an upthorn on my side too. "
"16210130","16211850"," Starship is not flown, man."
"16211970","16212790"," It's still not."
"16213010","16214150"," No matter what you say, right?"
"16214850","16218610"," It is still not the largest rocket to fly into space. "
"16219630","16221430"," You can't take that claim."
"16221790","16224690"," It's the biggest to fly, not successfully."
"16225650","16228650"," Sorry, you still don't have that title. "
"16230170","16232610"," The sloppiness of that launch upset me deeply."
"16233510","16235290"," I don't want to hear the excuses."
"16238190","16240390"," Truly like, I'm expecting that way. "
"16240490","16241690"," It's expecting that thing to fly."
"16241970","16245090"," I'll be honest with you."
"16246850","16249610"," We have that tech in the 60s and you got to say, no, we didn't. "
"16250010","16250510"," It's new tech."
"16251210","16251870"," I'm like, no, no, no."
"16251990","16253490"," This is 1960s. "
"16253930","16256930"," That means we had the tech being developed in the 1940s."
"16256930","16259190"," It's now 2023."
"16259890","16261030"," I don't want to hear it anymore. "
"16261810","16263730"," It's just wasting time in my view."
"16265450","16266470"," Waste in time."
"16273580","16274940"," I agree too, John. "
"16277400","16281270"," The largest successful rocket launch in history?"
"16281970","16282910"," Not Starship."
"16284250","16284750"," Proven."
"16289380","16290300"," Yeah, I like Toyota. "
"16290640","16292520"," I owned a Toyota for many years."
"16292740","16293200"," I love that truck."
"16293780","16295380"," That truck I ever had, period. "
"16301510","16304090"," Well, it's not, no, my expectations are high."
"16304850","16306090"," My expectations are very high."
"16306390","16311250"," My real problem with SpaceX is the conversation surrounding it. "
"16311910","16313170"," Especially the public conversation."
"16313870","16315190"," It's being steered right now."
"16320050","16325850"," You have to mind me, you have to understand that I have multiple people in my family that work for"
"16325850","16329070"," directly right now for Tesla and SpaceX. "
"16329630","16330830"," We have family get together."
"16331050","16336110"," So our conversations, in no way, mirror the public conversations."
"16337310","16343210"," They're distinctly different than the public conversation about these companies. "
"16353400","16355040"," Yeah, that's what I'm doing just some guy."
"16355120","16355980"," I'm not doing shit right now."
"16358520","16359980"," I'm just grinding here. "
"16360100","16360320"," Look at this."
"16360420","16361740"," Just yee-haw."
"16361860","16363160"," Take all your putting call money. "
"16373300","16374680"," No, I can't call it."
"16375000","16377500"," Right now, I can't call this is going up or down."
"16377980","16380540"," Too many conflicting signals right now. "
"16380860","16381560"," Tesla looks bullish."
"16381880","16382440"," Just fuck right now."
"16383740","16384540"," Super bullish. "
"16393360","16395080"," Vix is rolling over right now."
"16397500","16399040"," Okay, I'm going to take a, how about this?"
"16399480","16399880"," I'll do 10."
"16401099","16402400"," I'll just do 10 pack. "
"16402660","16403160"," Okay, hold on."
"16408040","16411500"," I'm on 10, 4, 17s for 45 cents."
"16412580","16414720"," It's just a small, small position. "
"16427660","16429380"," Vix rolling over right now."
"16440300","16443980"," Yeah, you guys have to understand I've been a Tesla bull for like a fucking decade."
"16443980","16447520"," Like when I hear like, when I hear Cybertruck in here, I don't want to hear it anymore. "
"16448680","16450259"," We priced that in years ago."
"16455470","16458130"," I expected Cybertruck to be delivered years ago."
"16458470","16463529"," Not only that, I expected us to be working on like a, like a small truck, like the old-schooled"
"16463529","16465529"," small Toyota's and stuff at this point. "
"16466070","16467610"," I expected an SUV."
"16467970","16472529"," I already listed off my laundry complaints and I'll, and I'll be, I'll warn you."
"16472529","16474110"," Yeah, nor my view at least. "
"16474710","16480349"," If you deliver the Cybertruck, it results in a squeeze higher but not in repricing higher."
"16483009","16484790"," So it's still short-lived."
"16487130","16494730"," I need new, I need, I need, I need delivery and old promises and then pricing in new promises for"
"16494730","16497570"," me to feel confidence or comfortable personally. "
"16498930","16499529"," I'm a Tesla bull."
"16499730","16501349"," You gotta remember, I am a Tesla bull."
"16501990","16505369"," Like, and I don't like, don't like being called, but I'm not a Tesla bull or anything like that. "
"16505990","16510070"," There's like, this person doesn't like Tesla or this person doesn't believe in SpaceX."
"16510970","16512050"," I believe in SpaceX."
"16514410","16515230"," Believe in Tesla. "
"16516110","16518250"," I want him to get back to focusing on that shit."
"16528029","16528830"," I'm in calls."
"16529910","16531790"," I'm in a 417 C's. "
"16534430","16537890"," This is rolling over right now."
"16556099","16557380"," Thanks, STT."
"16561689","16563009"," Love to hang out with you brother. "
"16566759","16567860"," You know, Apple."
"16569000","16577860"," I remember, I remember when Apple stopped launching new products and there was a ER when they"
"16577860","16579640"," started to discuss."
"16581779","16606550"," I agree"
"16606550","16606910"," with that. "
"16607430","16608390"," That should happen."
"16608669","16610610"," I don't think $250,000 is enough money."
"16611230","16612169"," I think that's a chump change. "
"16614509","16616650"," It's not like you can battle a bank run anyways."
"16616950","16619189"," There's no real, there's no real way to battle a bank run."
"16641110","16642290"," Let me take a look at Apple quick. "
"16642470","16643830"," Let's get on the back of the Apple conversation."
"16644650","16653009"," So Apple had an ER."
"16663349","16664310"," Yeah, I'm watching Apple. "
"16664310","16665730"," I see the role in Apple right now."
"16671210","16672849"," Yeah, I'm definitely in a risky trade here."
"16683529","16685790"," Let me check Apple on the tool real quick. "
"16688570","16699250"," So Apple had an ER where they were like, look, yeah, I'm"
"16699250","16700110"," watching Apple right now."
"16704060","16705220"," Get my eyes on it."
"16707040","16711400"," Apple had this ER where they were like, yeah. "
"16712720","16716720"," This is a recent year or two ago, maybe in the past year."
"16717720","16726820"," Apple had an ER where they were like, look, we're switching our growth strategy to growing services"
"16726820","16733939"," and all the reporters and the people that like to buy Apple, these institutions and stuff, they"
"16733939","16735220"," couldn't understand what they were saying."
"16736259","16740220"," So Apple was like, hey, look, we're going to start our newest product as services. "
"16740680","16741640"," We're going to start charging people."
"16742960","16744599"," And we're going to make a lot of money off that."
"16744599","16746740"," And I remember Apple stock tanked. "
"16748340","16753759"," The first reported to about that, even though their earnings were outstanding, but then the"
"16753759","16760279"," earnings kept growing on those services and then eventually Apple caught up in price too, but it's"
"16760279","16761900"," not the shiny rock."
"16762119","16767460"," Like it's not a shiny ring or a shiny rock to be like, yeah, we're focusing on this as growth."
"16768200","16774439"," And that's a key point, right?"
"16775599","16776880"," That's part of growth, right?"
"16777520","16783120"," We expect you to launch this new thing, this thing that is you have to have, right?"
"16785360","16787340"," I'm watching Apple right now roll over. "
"16787960","16788700"," God damn it."
"16792900","16793920"," I'm flat right now."
"16793960","16794960"," I'm down a penny right now. "
"16796760","16798100"," I'm watching Apple right now."
"16798160","16798440"," It's rolling."
"16801040","16802520"," All right, I'm flat again. "
"16802660","16803860"," I'm down a penny on that trade."
"16809510","16810750"," Too risky right now."
"16810790","16811390"," I'm watching Apple. "
"16820760","16821780"," I'm flat right here."
"16825170","16826290"," Good eyes on Apple."
"16828230","16830290"," Man, I want to buy that so fucking bad though. "
"16832710","16835310"," I want to buy that Apple right there right where it is."
"16836230","16837890"," So that wasn't a shiny thing, right?"
"16838430","16841070"," Well, I guess it is a shiny thing for some companies."
"16841990","16843290"," I feel like PayPal or something. "
"16844510","16846270"," Services are shiny, but for Apple it's not."
"16846530","16851330"," And the fear, the real true fear with Apple is, okay, so you're telling us you're going to focus on"
"16851330","16852070"," payment services."
"16853290","16856910"," And your ER is going to be kick ass, but at the same time you're not introducing new products,"
"16856910","16857270"," right?"
"16857410","16860610"," This need, this thing that's needed, right?"
"16860870","16862070"," That's what Apple is known for. "
"16862870","16863750"," Everybody has to have an Apple watch."
"16864030","16865250"," Everybody has to have an eye watch."
"16866730","16870630"," And of course, Apple bulls are like, we want an Apple car. "
"16870950","16873170"," Some Apple's tell you they don't want a car, but they do."
"16873890","16875650"," They want you to have to have your Apple car."
"16876530","16879150"," Many of you are Apple TV shows and movies. "
"16880190","16882550"," Personally, I can't stand Apple TV shows and movies."
"16882970","16884090"," It's like taking an elevator."
"16885130","16886450"," It's like two antiseptic for me. "
"16886650","16887510"," But people like that shit."
"16888150","16890770"," People like saying I watch that Apple show."
"16891930","16893270"," And that's what Apple is. "
"16894070","16895230"," So they have to continually relax."
"16895230","16897170"," They have to continue to reinvent themselves with products."
"16897170","16903970"," And I did come back after services just based on the numbers that are making bank and eventually"
"16903970","16906090"," Apple stock ripped faces off, right?"
"16910490","16913450"," I know you guys like Apple TV and movies. "
"16913990","16915070"," I'm not trying to shit on you."
"16918170","16919670"," I know you guys like it."
"16924350","16927230"," I know you guys are going to say you love it. "
"16927470","16928630"," I can't stand it."
"16930050","16932090"," I feel like I'm in a..."
"16934750","16939690"," What's that show where the, where's the show, the acclaimed show from Apple where the guy tried to"
"16939690","16940090"," watch it?"
"16941470","16942330"," He's in the office."
"16943650","16945030"," What's the Apple TV show?"
"16945230","16949490"," I feel like everything is, I feel like I'm living that show by watching all of Apple TV. "
"16954230","16959490"," There's no risk in Apple TV shows."
"16960330","16960970"," What is it called?"
"16961510","16962850"," It's like bland to me."
"16964030","16972050"," I know that I'm being, I know that I'm being highly subjective too because I know that you guys"
"16972050","16972890"," love Apple TV. "
"16975550","16976710"," I don't know if it's a stat."
"16976890","16978470"," I think I shouldn't say that either."
"16978670","16981190"," It's a status thing to say I like Apple TV. "
"16981330","16982210"," What's that fucking show?"
"16984110","16984570"," No, no."
"16984710","16985310"," I like Ted Lasso."
"16985610","16986290"," That's not a bad show. "
"16991410","16994870"," It's like, why is it not coming up here?"
"16994990","16995550"," I want to see the show."
"16996430","16997930"," It's the one where..."
"17000500","17001480"," Goddamn, what's the name of that show?"
"17003400","17003720"," Severance."
"17003900","17004420"," You got it, Winky. "
"17005520","17006520"," Yeah, I watch Severance."
"17006520","17007220"," I fell asleep."
"17010360","17011320"," Severance, I fell asleep. "
"17016840","17018160"," I was like, fuck man."
"17018380","17021200"," I was like, Severance is like watching all of Apple TV in movies."
"17024460","17025920"," That's the first time I've said that to anybody. "
"17027380","17032660"," Everybody knows like I love Severance and I love Apple TV and I'm like, I feel like I'm living"
"17032660","17035300"," Severance by watching all of Apple TV."
"17037960","17039060"," It's Severance."
"17039440","17042680"," I can't prep the bear music. "
"17043700","17044300"," Ooh."
"17045440","17046340"," Hey, guess what I did?"
"17048340","17049580"," Guess what I did."
"17051020","17052360"," I forgot to tell you guys. "
"17053940","17057360"," I worked on fucking stock market music."
"17059300","17063080"," I got a folder that says bear town on it now."
"17065360","17066100"," We'll have to go. "
"17066260","17067440"," I have a..."
"17067440","17068060"," How many bear songs?"
"17068420","17069120"," I got a ton of them."
"17069260","17069940"," You guys want to hear them?"
"17070640","17072380"," Oh, here comes the bear cross right here."
"17074000","17075320"," We're turning yellow now. "
"17077020","17077420"," Warning."
"17079040","17084100"," On the one minute chart right now, we have a bear cross forming."
"17086500","17087760"," You can see it right here. "
"17090700","17091780"," So you're right there."
"17091960","17094880"," Price needs to stay below for this cross to take place."
"17096060","17099900"," I am not believing in it just yet. "
"17100780","17102680"," Oh, it'll be something like this right here."
"17103320","17104420"," That's where your bloodbath is."
"17106360","17107240"," You guys are going to..."
"17107240","17112740"," All right, so I've got the bear music queued, but I'm not buying it. "
"17113880","17116480"," I think we trade up until one o'clock tomorrow afternoon."
"17116620","17117160"," That's my thesis."
"17121010","17124230"," But I've got a list of songs here for the bears. "
"17125810","17128510"," I actually did that work, but I forgot to tell you guys."
"17128630","17130070"," I have a whole entire..."
"17131170","17132490"," I got jams, man."
"17135210","17136170"," I got some jams. "
"17137410","17138570"," Should I turn some of this shit on?"
"17139330","17140990"," Like, you guys know dangerous now."
"17142230","17143370"," But I've got other songs."
"17150850","17152590"," Apple recovering right now. "
"17156870","17158670"," I couldn't do Apple TV, man."
"17161510","17162390"," All right, how about this?"
"17162990","17166070"," We'll start the bear music because the bears think we're going down."
"17166330","17168510"," So we'll start the bear music. "
"17168750","17171210"," If you don't like the song, say something and I'll delete it."
"17182040","17184580"," If you don't like it, I'll delete it."
"17185180","17185660"," Let me know. "
"17229860","17231000"," You guys can't hear this?"
"17235450","17237450"," Can you guys not hear this or can you hear this?"
"17242990","17244190"," Ah, hold on."
"17278400","17279060"," Hold on a second."
"17279180","17280260"," I'm going to turn on. "
"17280380","17280640"," Hold on a second."
"17291410","17292670"," Tell me if you can hear this right here."
"17306540","17307280"," Can you hear that?"
"17354660","17355720"," I'm going to have to reset it. "
"17355800","17355980"," Hold on."
"17361570","17362790"," All right, we'll do one more test."
"17362790","17364010"," Can you hear this?"
"17364270","17364950"," Can you hear it now?"
"17430670","17431770"," That's a shame because of mine. "
"17431890","17432610"," It sounds awesome."
"17523300","17525280"," Say play that one again or go to the next one."
"17526680","17530060"," I think that was pretty good. "
"17530160","17530780"," I didn't mind that one."
"17550650","17553610"," Huge bear flag right now on the S&P 500."
"17554370","17558050"," The whites crossing the red on the one minute chart right now in the five minute. "
"17558530","17559650"," Blood in the market."
"17603210","17604890"," Okay, so I was told no one that one."
"17608800","17609540"," How about this one?"
"17641120","17644960"," Yeah, it does sound kind of bullish, doesn't it?"
"17665330","17670430"," Yeah, I don't know. "
"17675130","17682920"," Man, I feel that one either."
"17685430","17686530"," I already know about that one."
"17691070","17691470"," Yeah. "
"17698010","17698970"," Let's try the next one."
"17726510","17729900"," Oh, that's bearish right there."
"17808850","17812830"," Maybe I was wrong in having these songs down. "
"17813630","17814750"," Let's go to the next one."
"17821610","17826950"," Oh, that's some bearish right there."
"17832430","17834110"," The Mortal Kombat theme song. "
"17838110","17845380"," I think the first song is my favorite."
"17857490","17857870"," Yeah."
"17877400","17878060"," It's all right. "
"17878180","17878920"," It's not fast enough."
"17886610","17887430"," Hey, Crazy Eddie."
"17887570","17887870"," How you doing?"
"17920620","17923540"," Trying out some bear music and seeing what we like and what we don't like. "
"17932950","17934270"," This is bearish consolidation."
"17964570","17965590"," Same to you, Crazy Eddie."
"17966750","17968490"," We're trying out a bear town music. "
"17968690","17969070"," I'm not fine."
"17969210","17972390"," I thought I had some songs, but I'm not a fan right now."
"17978260","17985480"," Yeah, it's hard to get music that I'm not going to get copyrighted on. "
"17985480","17988820"," That's some bad shit right"
"17988820","18007320"," there."
"18029430","18030750"," Music and jazz."
"18030750","18030990"," Music and jazz. "
"18033890","18042350"," Music and jazz."
"18042950","18044330"," That one's not too bad."
"18044330","18048640"," Music and jazz. "
"18050440","18053620"," Music and jazz."
"18061400","18065660"," Music and jazz."
"18079430","18084050"," Music and"
"18084050","18091590"," jazz. "
"18091590","18113030"," It's"
"18113030","18121570"," some John Haggerty music."
"18132430","18134250"," Maybe this is John Haggerty music right here."
"18144790","18146390"," You might have to go back to Old Faithful. "
"18151900","18152760"," Let me check a bunch of these."
"18154760","18156100"," Maybe back to Old Faithful."
"18156180","18157880"," You guys just come to expect the Old Faithful. "
"18171580","18172940"," Two or three songs to go is good."
"18176920","18177760"," What, this one?"
"18195800","18196600"," That one?"
"18201240","18201860"," Yeah."
"18212870","18213670"," Oh, here we go. "
"18213870","18215250"," I know some of you guys like..."

"18441900","18443000"," We'll just give a quick market update."
"18443300","18449280"," We've got a one and five minute bear plane forming above here."
"18449900","18450940"," Now trading down. "
"18451160","18460560"," If you remember before, the open today, this yellow line that you see right here, this is the high"
"18460560","18461760"," from yesterday."
"18461760","18467860"," Just so you can see we're coming back into right now, bloodbathing it down to this previous high on"
"18467860","18468240"," the bell."
"18468980","18470540"," This is on Friday here. "
"18473100","18481440"," Down below here, this is the low at 4.15.57 is the low from the previous low on the"
"18481440","18483040"," earlier part of the day."
"18483240","18490080"," Then we've got the implied move down at 4.15.11. This whole day has been a series of trading"
"18490080","18493260"," up and down consolidation here."
"18494160","18497360"," You can see this nice beautiful bloodbath taking place right now. "
"18498440","18503760"," Bears have on target down below to at least get to that 4.15.11 down here."
"18504540","18507260"," I apologize to any that's just joining me right now."
"18509780","18513160"," I was unwilling to take a trade up here, up or down. "
"18513360","18515240"," I did jump into calls once or twice."
"18516100","18518880"," But I closed them out when we were up here consolidating."
"18519500","18521400"," I couldn't take the trade either way. "
"18521560","18524180"," Now I didn't take puts over here mostly because I was digging around music."
"18524940","18526240"," That's because I did a bunch of work."
"18526380","18531080"," I'm like, yeah, I'm going to fuck around with those puts on those music right now. "
"18531380","18533700"," That shouldn't mean you shouldn't stay and puts down here."
"18534660","18537640"," Breaking through the previous high from Friday."
"18538920","18545640"," Now down below, you'll be looking for a new low at 4.15.56. Don't forget that implied move. "
"18545780","18548040"," We still have not tagged it down below here."
"18548420","18555360"," The implied move on the upside was 4.18.10. We're able to get to 4.17.82. That's another"
"18555360","18556860"," 40 cents or so."
"18557380","18561860"," So just the implied move of the day pretty close to the upside on this one, right?"
"18562500","18570120"," And then down below, you'd expect that we'd try to get down here to at least check this 4.15 "
"18570120","18574960",".57. And then we've got the pre-market low of 4.15.19 down below. "
"18575060","18578280"," I wish I had taken this trade now and not fucked around with music, but that's okay."
"18581000","18590320"," Yeah, I can't play a nice, nice right now."
"18590380","18592640"," You see 4.15.75 coming into play. "
"18593300","18595620"," Vicks still has more room to trade higher here."
"18595800","18600560"," Vicks can go all the way to 16.34. So probably not done going down right now."
"18600560","18606580"," Even if there's a pullback here, even if there's a pullback above, which we probably are still not"
"18606580","18619790"," done heading down here and retesting this low at least at 4.15.57. Vicks"
"18619790","18622490"," now trading 16.18 right now. "
"18623030","18627490"," That target above and the Vicks again is colored in places."
"18627490","18634270"," There's some volatility right where Vicks is right now, but then at 16.40. It would be a target for"
"18634270","18635330"," the Vicks above right now."
"18635730","18655410"," 16.40. Just"
"18655410","18657770"," retested the previous low on the day right there. "
"18668680","18670660"," Okay, take a look at RCMT."
"18671300","18672340"," Let me take a look."
"18688560","18700080"," Has a gap to fill above at 14.60, 14.71. Another gap on high at 17.78. Nope,"
"18700280","18701080"," won't talk about it. "
"18701680","18703060"," Thank you for saying something, Winky."
"18704760","18706460"," I cannot talk about it."
"18706540","18706980"," I apologize. "
"18707920","18708500"," Who asked for that?"
"18711500","18712520"," Who asked me to look?"
"18712640","18713320"," Do I know that person?"
"18719120","18720560"," Let me see who asked that."
"18721260","18722320"," I think I know Gary."
"18724680","18726720"," I think Gary's been here for a while. "
"18727620","18728940"," Now hold on Gary, let me take a look."
"18729120","18730900"," I think you've been around for some time."
"18732060","18733300"," I do recognize your name. "
"18733480","18733700"," Hold on."
"18740830","18742270"," Yeah, we should be there soon, John."
"18745540","18746700"," We're almost there, brother. "
"18750780","18752020"," Yeah, Gary, hang tight, brother."
"18752340","18762300"," Normally don't talk about those tickers because I can get into trouble for pumping stocks that"
"18762300","18763480"," are too low of a float."
"18766780","18768300"," So I don't want to be a part of that. "
"18768880","18769200"," RCMT."
"18774700","18775880"," Hang tight, I'll take a look at it here."
"18787130","18788290"," I'll show you what I see at least. "
"18792350","18794450"," There's some resistance we're coming into, bro."
"18797330","18797790"," 1326."
"18799270","18801410"," You can possibly re-enter the trade above. "
"18807880","18809440"," It's getting a little long of a tooth."
"18816920","18819160"," That's where your cell is up there."
"18823250","18824610"," It's getting a little long of a tooth. "
"18825070","18828590"," If you wanted to pick it back up, you need to see it."
"18828850","18829970"," I'll show you real quick."
"18830930","18835090"," I just want to give these bears a second here on Spy. "
"18835590","18836090"," You ready, brother?"
"18836830","18837450"," I got you covered."
"18844810","18845210"," RCMT."
"18846250","18848210"," Now, I want you to know out there if you're watching this. "
"18849330","18851490"," I can't recommend you trade this ticker, okay?"
"18852450","18853470"," That's a low float ticker."
"18853530","18861670"," It's likely being run by pumpers, not Gary."
"18863650","18870050"," A little float stock, meaning probably by $100 million worth of these shares to make this shit"
"18870050","18870290"," move. "
"18871010","18872690"," Now, it does look like it wants to squeeze."
"18872910","18873610"," I agree with you here."
"18874170","18876210"," The good thing for you is that it's sitting out monthly. "
"18877730","18879010"," Now, I want to show you something here."
"18879110","18880010"," See how it squeezed up?"
"18881730","18885630"," And it rechecked its weekly and failed, right?"
"18886830","18888950"," But I want you to pay attention to this orange line right here."
"18888950","18890230"," This is it's weekly. "
"18890530","18891490"," It's a very emotional thing."
"18892130","18893270"," This line is important."
"18894190","18900030"," And my point behind this is if you like the trade is dead right now. "
"18901530","18909930"," But if price goes above your weekly and it holds, there is a trade higher where you start to take"
"18909930","18915490"," out these trapped buyers up here, like 17, 20 bucks."
"18916350","18926210"," IE, you'd need to see price come above $13.50, hold $13.50, and then allow"
"18926210","18930010"," the daily to come up, the hourly to come up, and then push price higher."
"18932010","18938270"," So my point here is to expect sellers, number one, you're going to expect sellers. "
"18945280","18950500"," You can expect sellers at $13.31 probably lower, probably 13 bucks."
"18951400","18956280"," So the trade is, you know, it's not that you can't take this part of trade, but this is where"
"18956280","18956820"," the trade was."
"18957020","18959000"," All these triggers down below is where the trade was. "
"18960300","18966080"," So you want to see price, you want to like take the money and run, let price get above, and"
"18966080","18968940"," then consolidate, allow this stuff to come up."
"18968940","18975640"," And then if you begin to see it trading off $13.40 higher, that's when you take trade, because you"
"18975640","18980260"," don't want to take this trade higher and get trapped in an overnight situation and it blasts down"
"18980260","18980700"," on your ass."
"18981040","18981700"," I hope that helps. "
"18982780","18984080"," That explanation helps."
"18984600","18985860"," So is there a trade higher on this?"
"18986320","18986540"," Yeah."
"18987920","18993960"," But you want to see it hold above $13.30 and then you want to see these other triggers, chase"
"18993960","18997560"," it and get lend support to it. "
"19006930","19008030"," Does that help at all?"
"19010570","19018050"," So like if you want to go close that 15 and 15, 40, 15, 70, there's a trap in there"
"19018050","19018650"," against you."
"19019590","19024630"," So you need to see it, not like it could go up and close for 15 bucks, come swing right"
"19024630","19026310"," back down and just go to the depths of hell again."
"19029370","19037850"," So far, trading the previous low on the day here on the spy, VIX. "
"19037990","19038990"," I'm going to take a look at that real quick."
"19040550","19041970"," VIX with a reversal here."
"19043030","19044430"," We might not be done here. "
"19045670","19055190"," I'm going to look to see if we'll get a reversal on spy up here at 14, 416, 16"
"19055190","19057130"," for further down."
"19057130","19058690"," See if you can get that implied move."
"19059050","19063630"," You know, the key point here is that this is the implied move down here, right?"
"19063890","19069050"," And we already got, if you're looking at the entire market, how the options market is, see how we"
"19069050","19076550"," kind of traded the implied move, traded the down move. "
"19077870","19084710"," Kind of need to see more puts entered or start trading lower on this implied move."
"19084710","19087850"," So basically the both sides of the trade for today have been hit."
"19089470","19094730"," On the spy, the options market, not the zero day market. "

"19122060","19124740"," As long as price stays above that red line."
"19135240","19136660"," Look at it again real quick. "
"19140070","19148530"," See, it's a kind of a trade man where if our CMT closes the day at like 1331, you're either"
"19148530","19151170"," going to go to squeeze the overnight or it's going to blast down on you."
"19152690","19156030"," I think it's like a take the money and run and look for consolidation."
"19157890","19159110"," Gary, check back in. "

"19305110","19313170"," like 100,000 contracts, and then you would, I could come right on the show here and be like, hey,"

"19347290","19348830"," It's all these pumping up rooms work. "
"19348830","19349830"," It's not you, Gary."
"19350110","19352630"," It's that I don't want to be a part of that."

"19514040","19515140"," So they short the market."
"19515380","19516280"," They buy it when they have to. "
"19516460","19519640"," They just hold it until it comes back and they make their money back."
"19519740","19520740"," They take both sides of the trade."
"19520740","19526340"," And I'm still in agreement with Mirror that we are going to roll. "
"19526440","19527060"," We're going to sell May."
"19527200","19528060"," I agree with that statement."
"19529280","19532520"," So if you're if you're if you own the VIX right now, I don't think it's a bad thing to"
"19532520","19533200"," know in the VIX right now. "
"19537790","19540150"," What happens if the Fed says 0% no raise?"
"19540450","19546510"," Well, you've got Tim out there from Wall Street Journal saying to expect a raise."
"19547090","19547890"," Now Tim."
"19547890","19551810"," Tim Rose is the mouthpiece of the Fed if he didn't know already know that. "
"19553150","19560290"," And he put out an article this morning at 530 in the morning saying expect a fed rate hike."
"19560810","19563230"," And then expect talk about a pause."
"19564970","19568470"," Those are both of those are bullish for bulls believe it or not. "
"19568630","19570070"," May you may not think that's the case."
"19571050","19572510"," But it is bullish for bulls."
"19572510","19579290"," The one thing you do not want to hear the word or wording or thinking about is rate cuts. "
"19579910","19585730"," You do not want to hear anything like we're getting a rate increase or a rate hike."
"19586550","19588410"," We're going to start looking at a pause."
"19588850","19593370"," And then some reporter says something like how about rate cuts and he goes, yeah, we'll think about"
"19593370","19593630"," that. "
"19594070","19594630"," That's bad."
"19596030","19600950"," Even if the initial reaction is a move higher, it's only to grab liquidity."
"19602690","19607630"," Rate rate cuts are I know that bulls don't want to hear that, but that's the truth. "
"19611170","19618350"," But zero percent like no rate hikes pausing any weakness that comes."
"19618950","19623390"," You know how we hear things like you hear things like sell the news."
"19624610","19630230"," Like I can probably tell you what's going to happen based on where the price of spies when any news"
"19630230","19630590"," breaks. "
"19631510","19633490"," If we're going to go up or go down."
"19635810","19641930"," So depending on where price is on the Fed rate hike meeting, we're pretty high right now, right?"
"19642190","19646010"," I would expect us to squeeze to 420 and then roll over right then and there."
"19647350","19653130"," The way the options market is, the hedging in the market is it looks like 420 and then it looks"
"19653130","19654330"," like 430 down the road. "
"19659980","19663140"," The only really bad thing that you could hear would be rate cuts."
"19679040","19683360"," I'm using a TDC VIX."
"19687710","19689870"," If you're going to own the VIX, I recommend owning VIX futures. "
"19727860","19734720"," I think what you're seeing on, I think what you're seeing on, I think what you're seeing on weebull"
"19734720","19736260"," is possibly VIX futures."
"19737680","19741700"," But I use the VIX, which I believe is not on weebull."
"19741800","19742960"," It might be, but I don't think there is. "
"19746540","19753000"," It was VIX, I think I believe it was June 21st, 26C on VIX."
"19767820","19770520"," The implied move right now is 415 on today."
"19773930","19776570"," I'm not expecting much more further down. "
"19777990","19779850"," They don't want those 400s to print."
"19793780","19800000"," So my point earlier today was I used to buy weekly VIX calls, they never fucking print."
"19800180","19806300"," You got to pry them out two months out on the same contract or the next contract, but never this"
"19806300","19808380"," contract, like a weekly. "
"19810540","19816220"," If I'm trading VIX calls like a weekly or like a one day, one day, two day, I have to"
"19816220","19816980"," time them perfectly."
"19818880","19821040"," The highest probability is just owning."
"19826230","19830790"," That's what I was saying earlier was, unless you time it perfectly, they burn the fuck. "
"19830970","19838710"," If you watch the chain on UVXY, if you watch the chain on VIX and UVXY calls on some close "
"19838710","19841650","-dated calls, they get torn up."
"19842650","19843450"," They get wrecked."
"19844030","19849030"," I was like expressing it in put spreads or VIX calls that are further dated, like month to months. "
"19849950","19850650"," Something like that."
"19851470","19852410"," Or just owning it."
"19855190","19856770"," Yeah, no, I'm not down with it one day. "
"19859370","19860150"," Not personally."
"19860410","19860970"," I've traded VIX."
"19861130","19861910"," I used to trade VIX. "
"19862270","19866150"," My only problem with VIX is when you're trading, it's so much work."
"19867410","19872130"," So it's like you have to time it perfectly and then you're in and you're out."
"19873070","19874490"," So I want nothing to do. "
"19874550","19877030"," For me personally, I've got no wants."
"19877370","19880290"," I can just buy put spreads and they'll fucking print and I have to watch them too closely."
"19883410","19884570"," Good question, though, Will. "
"19890850","19896070"," I used to get so pissed trading weeklies and one day I'd have the direction right."
"19897890","19900970"," And you get a big squeeze and that would be it."
"19901310","19902930"," It would just torch the options chain. "
"19923340","19925520"," HYG slowly closing the gap down below."
"19929700","19932800"," All that blood and apple, it's only down 26 cents in the day."
"19937780","19939080"," And Dixie on a high right now. "
"19939880","19941660"," Next I'll have a little bit of rolling over going on."
"19958480","19959860"," Nice day overall though."
"19960000","19962060"," Bears getting paid, bulls getting paid. "
"19964040","19967380"," Actually a decent day to trade the S&P 500."
"19977390","19979330"," I wouldn't expect too much either."
"19979590","19984770"," The expectation for me if you want to know my expectation has not changed for tomorrow. "
"19984770","19987230"," And that is the trade higher."
"19987750","19992590"," And then they're selling around 1.30, 3.30 in the afternoon."
"20020960","20024400"," Yeah, I think I showed if you come on that if you go on the show earlier, I showed. "
"20025600","20028280"," I showed the strike with 100,000 contracts."
"20028600","20035240"," I think it was 26 C on the 21st for VIX, 100,000 contracts, 17 million dollars."
"20037960","20041180"," I think it was 26 C, 100,000. "
"20041280","20042140"," I showed it this morning."
"20043480","20044720"," Let me see if they can show it again."
"20044840","20045080"," Hold on. "
"20046580","20047740"," Let me just say it'll look."
"20099910","20101830"," So I'll put it on the screen right now for you."
"20103210","20105090"," It's June 21st. "
"20109210","20111310"," Yeah, it looks like the 26 C."
"20111310","20115850"," See it right there, my cursor is 100,000 contracts."
"20118670","20119550"," Right there."
"20120870","20122110"," You guys see it right there?"
"20139010","20140910"," Yeah, I don't like trading EVX. "
"20140930","20142030"," Why I've gotten torched."
"20143770","20146070"," Or at least calls, calls and puts."
"20150020","20151100"," I just like owning it. "
"20158330","20163510"," So the Treasury previously projected a $278 billion quarterly a borrowing."
"20163930","20168290"," So the US Treasury here lifts the April to June borrowing estimate to $726 billion."
"20168910","20174050"," Estimate presumes Congress addresses the debt ceiling and projects the $550 billion cash balance"
"20174050","20175190"," for the end of June. "
"20176290","20177970"," Yeah, I can't do calls and puts."
"20179110","20180570"," The EVX-Y is broken."
"20182650","20183670"," It's broken. "
"20184530","20188190"," Yeah, that's what I said."
"20189370","20190230"," That's what I said."
"20190230","20190310"," That's what I said. "
"20190430","20191330"," There's over 100,000."
"20191490","20199150"," I said longer dated with a high OI on it."
"20202990","20209790"," The conversation this morning was saying like if I'm sitting here and I'm going, yeah. "
"20209790","20213490"," The market's going to start crashing right now."
"20213730","20215610"," So we start ripping higher to $420."
"20216430","20218230"," I'm going to get torched in those, right?"
"20238750","20240450"," $17 million trade. "
"20240790","20243030"," $17 million trade on that strike."
"20262600","20289400"," No, no, no."
"20289400","20291320"," So you're getting all these signals right now. "
"20291580","20293860"," Like you're getting warmed up into this rate decision."
"20294680","20303660"," You got Temeros saying, you know, like expect a rate hike and then a pause or talk about a pause."
"20304560","20309800"," You've got Malik coming out and saying the Fed will not cut rates. "
"20310180","20316380"," It's very important for you as a market participant to listen closely to what's being said to you."
"20317560","20321160"," And just realize that they're telling you specific things."
"20321380","20325900"," They're saying rate hike, pause, but no cuts. "
"20326560","20328360"," It's a very important thing."
"20328940","20335980"," If you start to hear whispers from the mouthpieces or the leakers, anything like cuts, like you"
"20335980","20336900"," don't want to hear that language."
"20337140","20338160"," You start hearing that language. "
"20339060","20340160"," It'll disrupt the market."
"20340920","20341720"," They'll be panicked."
"20342760","20347480"," Even if we squeeze higher, it would just be like, in my view, it'd be a liquidity grab. "
"20348900","20356260"," So when you hear things like pause or rate hike and then pause, we'll take a look down the road."
"20357940","20366060"," You know, but number one, just as a part of society, I want to see us above the rate of"
"20366060","20366060"," inflation."
"20368100","20372380"," I think the Fed wants to see us above the rate of inflation, even for just the time. "
"20372960","20378020"," Especially if we're going to run into more failures, commercial bank failures, any more banking"
"20378020","20382920"," failures, anything along the way, you know they're going to have to pour some money into the"
"20382920","20383540"," system, right?"
"20384200","20390780"," You know, they're going to dip their fingers and their fat hands into this money that they've"
"20390780","20395340"," already recreated and have fake removed from the system."
"20396780","20398100"," That's the balance sheet, right?"
"20400440","20403120"," We know they dip their hands in for regional banks."
"20405660","20409240"," And just be aware of the language that's used. "
"20410180","20413120"," I guess that point here is be aware of the language that's used."
"20413720","20417500"," And that doesn't mean if we get a rate hike that we don't get weakness in the market."
"20418520","20425960"," But that's probably due to the price of spy, the price of the stock market has less to do with,"
"20426260","20427240"," are we going to crash?"
"20427720","20434500"," So if you hear like 50 BPS in the markets week and you interpret that as we're going to start"
"20434500","20439300"," crashing, there's a fault in that argument because the Fed is fighting inflation. "
"20440660","20446920"," Now the Fed has not broken the markets yet where there's real damage done if they're continuing to"
"20446920","20448360"," raise rates or even pause."
"20456210","20462770"," You start to see Vicks up with the rally melt up if we hold 420 and begin to attack 430."
"20500830","20502870"," Who's saying spicy over there?"
"20505450","20510230"," Is that, uh, is that, uh, does that James Roland hide now under a different username?"
"20531870","20537480"," You were going down. "
"20540520","20545760"," Tis a large load of steaming BS."
"20545760","20547080"," Pause no higher for longer."
"20547260","20548300"," J-Pause is going to eat third pie. "
"20548480","20549100"," This time is different."
"20549680","20550300"," Thanks are fine."
"20550600","20552900"," No credit crunch coming, et cetera, et cetera. "
"20553060","20553500"," Yeah."
"20553680","20559080"," If you're a bull out there, you're only like literally you're only saving graces."
"20559340","20564460"," Raising rates are pausing with talk of raising rates down the road. "
"20565280","20574380"," If you fucking hear them fucking fart like like a silent whisper fart like anything like that."
"20574600","20575060"," Cutting rates."
"20575720","20576880"," That is not your cue. "
"20577420","20579300"," They feed that bullshit to you."
"20579980","20584000"," Like when I read that shit, I read people being like, moment they cut rates, the market's going all"
"20584000","20584520"," time eyes."
"20584700","20585520"," I'm like, oh, little squeeze. "
"20587200","20589880"," I'll be honest, I was talking about this this morning."
"20590040","20591580"," There's some things you don't want to."
"20592100","20594240"," If you're a bull, that's long. "
"20595740","20597540"," There's three things you don't want to happen."
"20598560","20600000"," You don't want to see war end in Ukraine."
"20600800","20601860"," You don't want to see rate cuts. "
"20602320","20609580"," You don't want to see tensions going away with China."
"20611800","20620920"," I'm almost sure at this point that one of the reasons nobody talks about that the market is having"
"20620920","20625400"," a soft landing is due to a proxy war with Ukraine and a buildup of China."
"20627140","20628140"," It's a part of the answer. "
"20628340","20630200"," And part of it's raising rates."
"20641140","20642580"," It's got to be."
"20642840","20644740"," It's got to be a part of it. "
"20647380","20656840"," And my assumption is at this point that those nations are in on it, those three countries know that"
"20656840","20660180"," politically and just intelligence and the world economy."
"20661280","20668860"," My assumption is that the U.S., China, and Russia know that the only way not to fall into a"
"20668860","20676660"," depression is likely to wag the dog, if that makes sense, even if it's through proxy war."
"20680350","20689050"," That there's some kind of ability to wage war indirectly"
"20689050","20694870"," along with a threat of war. "
"20696030","20698490"," And that is helping with the soft landing."
"20706740","20708180"," Hey, Omar, how you doing, brother?"
"20709860","20710840"," Good to see you, man."
"20712300","20725930"," Yeah, I"
"20725930","20727610"," do think they cut rates at some point. "
"20727890","20737570"," The other day I was looking at a, there was a post that showed a flyer with advertising"
"20737570","20740790"," for prices of goods from the 1950s."
"20741610","20744490"," I mean, eventually they're going to lose that fight with inflation, right?"
"20745410","20747450"," It's mostly a matter of buying time."
"20747450","20750670"," We guys remember me talking about this last year, I think. "
"20751490","20760770"," I got lambasted for saying this, and I was like, they're just buying time for you to accept higher"
"20760770","20761270"," prices."
"20763470","20769950"," You're going to accept higher prices, and you're going to, hopefully, your company is going to pay"
"20769950","20770330"," you more."
"20772330","20773310"," Sometimes they don't. "
"20773310","20777970"," Sometimes it's 15 to 20 years down the road, where they eventually catch back up."
"20778150","20780010"," Anyone that's been through that cycle knows that."
"20784970","20786190"," It's kind of gross, right?"
"20787590","20790310"," My assumption is that all three nations are involved, too. "
"20791750","20797910"," My assumption is that behind a closed door, they know they have to wage some kind of war."
"20799070","20800390"," We saw it in our own country."
"20801410","20806530"," If you guys know anything about short-term, long-term debt cycles knows that we go through civil"
"20806530","20809450"," unrest, we go through corporate taxation. "
"20811410","20817710"," When we go into a recession or depression, we go through a war, those kind of things help stabilize"
"20817710","20819290"," recessions and depressions."
"20820430","20825630"," So just seeing that stuff happening right now, we did some digging this week."
"20825630","20832610"," It was really hard to find direct correlations right now. "
"20832650","20833850"," No one's talking about it."
"20835190","20844270"," The only articles I've found are mostly sentiment-based, like, oh, war bad."
"20844530","20845410"," War is bad for the economy. "
"20845950","20846490"," That's not real."
"20846690","20847130"," That's not true."
"20848150","20849670"," When it's a current war, they don't want to say that. "
"20850070","20857650"," You're not going to see the news tell you a continued fight in Ukraine is good for us having a"
"20857650","20858170"," soft landing."
"20858310","20859730"," You're not going to hear someone tell you that publicly."
"20860350","20867920"," They'll tell you that 10 years from now or 20 years from now. "
"20871580","20873500"," I'm always bizared out by that."
"20874240","20880520"," Johnny, I'm always like, I'll be on social media and I'm like, why are these fucking bears saying"
"20880520","20881900"," that they want rate hikes?"
"20884280","20885800"," Then we're going to crash from rate hikes."
"20885800","20887220"," I'm like, what if they were crashing?"
"20888360","20895140"," Then I see bulls saying like, if they cut rates, bro, we're going to the mood and I'm like, so"
"20895140","20896660"," fuck are you both being fed?"
"20897980","20899960"," You're both in the wrong side of the trade. "
"20901400","20904700"," If I was a bear, I'd be waiting for it."
"20904820","20908300"," If you got a rate cut, I'd be a bear just waiting for a squeeze for your liquidity and be"
"20908300","20909560"," like, fucking them all in short."
"20911720","20912520"," That's me. "
"20920470","20929220"," Yeah, there's an idea here that I"
"20929220","20938200"," would even pause it that if Ukraine had a truce at some point that you would then see a flare"
"20938200","20940280"," up in China and Taiwan to keep it going."
"20941380","20942560"," Kind of have to keep it going."
"20945820","20946940"," The key is people working. "
"20947080","20949000"," Work is people working because it keeps production going."
"20949420","20950780"," It keeps GDP numbers up."
"20951700","20954140"," There's a lot of positive and the war is not in that backyard. "
"20954380","20955620"," It's not like we're fighting the war."
"20956060","20957980"," It's not like there's a draft in the United States."
"20959600","20963020"," It's not like you're going to fight that war, so you're accepting it. "
"20963700","20964680"," And that's fucked up too."
"20964820","20968600"," As a US citizen, you don't actually have to fight that war."
"20969160","20972020"," As a Chinese citizen, you don't have to fight that war right now. "
"20972680","20979240"," There are some Russian citizens fighting that war, but those are citizens from republics and so, or"
"20979240","20987760"," not so, in the federation, Russian Federation, that are already, you know, like, they're, you know,"
"20988400","20992640"," they're fourth class citizens."
"20994640","20997120"," It's not like people from Moscow are fighting that war."
"21005070","21007390"," Do I think there's, I think there's still a hard landing. "
"21007690","21008190"," I just don't."
"21008350","21008910"," Well, no."
"21009210","21010650"," So yes and no. "
"21012750","21014570"," Do I think there's a hard landing?"
"21015310","21016650"," Yes, but price matters."
"21018490","21020290"," Like the price of the heart."
"21020590","21024970"," I think that's where the soft landing comes into play is historically. "
"21027050","21030090"," Let's say we get that hard landing next year and the markets at 370."
"21031210","21032390"," Is the hard landing."
"21034050","21035190"," Remember when we were down at 345?"
"21036190","21039350"," The hard landing was 2,800, you know, 2,400. "
"21040010","21044730"," There was, there was when we were down at 345, actually in January of 2022."
"21046270","21047470"," If you look at Elliott wave."
"21048430","21050650"," They had like 1600 was one of the targets. "
"21051590","21053430"," I believe 1600 24."
"21053610","21054430"," I was one of the 24."
"21054670","21058850"," It was one of the targets, but the, but the probability of those. "
"21059150","21064550"," I was hitting those was like 15% 5% of those low end targets."
"21065390","21069410"," It gets those, the probability that increases when we're trading down at 345, right?"
"21069550","21069770"," We're closer."
"21071230","21076910"," But the tools that they're using right now, us not being at 345 or 3,300. "
"21077650","21079890"," One of this one with this high in the market."
"21080750","21082750"," Those probabilities go back down again."
"21084030","21084590"," So. "
"21086550","21094990"," My point here to you is if they're using rates and if they're using time is the key one time."
"21096350","21102270"," We'll discuss time here in a minute, but if they're using their tools and if they're using war."
"21103250","21107430"," To soften the landing now and time passes. "
"21110010","21115470"," There's, there's an argument to me that we won't get down that low because we don't actually fight"
"21115470","21115910"," right now."
"21115910","21118590"," We're not fighting the rate of inflationary and it's time passes."
"21119270","21125510"," We do produce more and money becomes less valuable and also. "
"21126970","21129190"," Our economies grow over time, right?"
"21129430","21131950"," So time is the no one likes to talk about time."
"21132130","21135290"," I, that's one of the other things I don't ever hear Jay Pao talk about."
"21135790","21140950"," Maybe he does sometimes, but they don't really talk often about time passing. "
"21141130","21143030"," Time is like this big part of it."
"21143390","21148110"," When you trade the market sideways long enough, eventually all these."
"21149830","21152990"," All this velocity catches back up to you from decades. "
"21154210","21161290"," Years, half decades, decades and price does matter because what will happen is if we trade sideways"
"21161290","21161990"," long enough."
"21162830","21165230"," And we trade sideways and up long enough."
"21166190","21169610"," That pullback you look back and let's say five or 10 years ago. "
"21170150","21171510"," Should I should about 345?"
"21172510","21178190"," We traded for 70 or 490 came back down to 345 or 360, right?"
"21178750","21185750"," But we, you should have, but it doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't validate your point."
"21186590","21189450"," It means that you should have bought 345 traded it up."
"21190090","21193310"," You should have came back and bought 360, right?"
"21193690","21194790"," So you're not getting that ultimate. "
"21195170","21196730"," As a matter of fact, we talk about this sometimes."
"21197510","21201830"," You know, Mike Barry, Mike Barry's trade that he had on."
"21202610","21207830"," If we hadn't made that second leg lower, he'd probably be in fucking prison today. "
"21208630","21211230"," If he hadn't, if he didn't get that second leg lower."
"21212010","21217630"," Well, first of all, the length of time that he was in that trade, there was so much money that"
"21217630","21218210"," he didn't make."
"21219150","21223770"," And then the other aspect to that trade was, have we not made the second leg lower?"
"21224190","21228470"," Not only would he have not made all that money for seven years going up. "
"21228470","21233750"," He would have been flat with fees up his ass if we didn't make the second leg lower."
"21236710","21240370"," And you know that they're trying to stop that from happening again."
"21240450","21247270"," You know that they are going to do any and everything they can do to not have another 2000 or"
"21247270","21247810"," 2008. "
"21248910","21253570"," And I'll put, I'll make a case in point, a recent one."
"21255870","21257330"," COVID in COVID."
"21259850","21261770"," Just like playing chicken in a road. "
"21262890","21264610"," They turn the money printer on."
"21265130","21268950"," And that's the, that's one of those posits that yeah, we'll get a 2000 date."
"21269130","21269330"," Okay. "
"21269410","21274410"," Well, if we do get a 2000 date, will they do that same shit again?"
"21275170","21275470"," Right?"
"21275950","21276770"," Like they did in COVID."
"21277130","21283870"," Now, the other part to this equation would be if they turned on that faucet, and it still didn't"
"21283870","21284110"," work."
"21285190","21289530"," And that would mean that something was fundamentally functionally broken. "
"21290690","21292030"," So you have to find that for me."
"21292050","21292770"," I've done what that is."
"21294210","21296630"," Like something really, truly fucked up. "
"21299150","21300790"," Like those mortgage backsecurities."
"21300930","21302730"," It has to be something fraudulent."
"21303830","21305370"," That was part of the Mike Murray thing too, right?"
"21305770","21307490"," There was something fraudulent about our system. "
"21307490","21312750"," And modern monetary theory does not answer that question of fraud being fraudulent."
"21313650","21314410"," That's not good enough."
"21314570","21317090"," You need something that's like inherently fraud. "
"21318770","21320970"," In our, in our, in our system."
"21321330","21323590"," And I apologize, but MMT is not fraud."
"21323730","21325150"," Well, it is, but it isn't. "
"21325690","21330410"," It's legal fraud, but not mortgage backsecurities."
"21331550","21334990"," More mortgage backsecurities was legit fraud."
"21338200","21340960"," As I'm talking, talking about, this is to his point. "
"21341120","21347280"," It sounds like drug thinks this market is a whole new animal kept saying there is nothing like this"
"21347280","21351860"," market, but still thinks the biggest opportunities are ahead of us this year anticipates wild"
"21351860","21352140"," swings."
"21352440","21354020"," Yeah, I'm with drug on this."
"21354900","21357020"," I think it's sideways and up right now. "
"21357260","21359560"," I think there's, I think it's sideways and up."
"21360000","21367660"," And I think that depending upon where prices, when those wars end and we get price, or rate cuts,"
"21368120","21371840"," that would decide how deep the damage is."
"21372940","21373840"," Price is important. "
"21374320","21375380"," Time and prices."
"21376100","21377760"," Two things no one likes to discuss."
"21379400","21380880"," And there is this argument. "
"21381680","21384000"," I made a post on Twitter about risk on desks."
"21384960","21392040"," If you look at the stock market in October and then in March of January through March, there was"
"21392040","21393260"," risk put on this market."
"21393720","21395040"," You can't say there wasn't. "
"21395140","21395400"," There was."
"21395400","21401220"," There was risk put on this market and they're going to, they did it into March 31st."
"21401380","21401960"," Excuse me. "
"21404120","21405520"," Into April, believe it or not."
"21406660","21408340"," And they're still here in this market."
"21408560","21408820"," They're here. "
"21409180","21410580"," They're, they fucking own this market."
"21411260","21417160"," So even if you're looking into selling main go away, even if you're looking into the volatility"
"21417160","21423300"," from the debt ceiling crisis, the selling may go away, price will matter."
"21423800","21425360"," If we're selling made a 400. "
"21427540","21429120"," That's not 380 is it?"
"21429240","21429680"," It's not 360."
"21432020","21436520"," So it's, it's, I think if I were you and you're a bear."
"21438120","21445380"," Every time we sell the market, I would be paying very close attention. "
"21446180","21449820"," To breath versus price."
"21451260","21456240"," Where we are in breadth versus how much we've gone down in price."
"21457340","21459100"," And VIX is telling you the same thing. "
"21459300","21463060"," So VIX is right now is saying the same thing."
"21463220","21470560"," And there could be one bear argument saying, well, every once in a range in a range on VIX, you're"
"21470560","21473940"," going to get one moment to retrade load to 15 bucks."
"21474800","21476400"," We'll be right back to 20 and 30. "
"21476820","21477160"," Okay."
"21477460","21478040"," I'm down with that."
"21478060","21480360"," If we go back 20 to 30, no problem. "
"21480360","21484480"," We're range bound 20 to 30 and every once in a while, we're going to expect 40 and then 15"
"21484480","21484920"," or 10."
"21485560","21486000"," Okay."
"21486220","21487480"," I can accept that. "
"21487600","21489980"," That's, that's a, that's a valid argument."
"21490380","21495800"," But outside of that, VIX is probably your best tool telling you to expect lower volatility in the"
"21495800","21496040"," market."
"21496600","21500900"," Expectives to be bought, expect sideways and up over time. "
"21501820","21505820"," And that doesn't mean we don't have our seasonal lows."
"21506720","21508800"," Doesn't mean we don't have like a low in May."
"21509400","21511180"," Doesn't mean we don't have that one summer bloodbath. "
"21512120","21513980"," Doesn't mean we don't get a bloodbath September october."
"21515160","21516320"," You know, it doesn't mean any of that shit."
"21518680","21522640"," Just the volatility in the market, it's being suppressed. "
"21523280","21524760"," You know, we have compressed vol."
"21524960","21525480"," You can see that."
"21528790","21530010"," Yeah, it's not fraud enough. "
"21530150","21530750"," We need more fraud."
"21530950","21531590"," We need real fraud."
"21535470","21540710"," According to NBC News, the US military is tracking a balloon of unknown origin. "
"21541330","21547550"," It's reminding me of, it's reminding me of the 1950s, 60s and 70s."
"21549330","21551550"," A return to that."
"21552050","21560610"," My only, my only flying the ointment on that argument is I don't believe that our politicians, nor"
"21560610","21564570"," the US has agreed to not be greedy. "
"21565450","21574610"," I don't think that the US and the greedy people and politicians, corporate CEOs are willing to."
"21576270","21577070"," Live through."
"21578570","21583490"," It's not austerity, but it's like a time of tempered growth for decades. "
"21584450","21588070"," I think that I think it's just like why the market's going up right now."
"21588070","21591770"," I think there's, I think the market moves on at some point, and that's that whole time thing."
"21592170","21596230"," I think at some point the market is like, yeah, let's put some risk on. "
"21596330","21597550"," I've got cash sitting on the sidelines."
"21597750","21598710"," Let's put it to work."
"21598710","21605570"," I know that if you're a high wealth individual, that you see your money sitting inside of the bank,"
"21606050","21609770"," making 5% or 3%, and you're like, it's not good enough. "
"21610330","21611170"," It's time passes."
"21611370","21612330"," I need to put this money to work."
"21613230","21616550"," I can't just be slowly creeping behind. "
"21617050","21621430"," So you're going to see people put more risk with their money to bring profit."
"21622930","21625730"," So the equity markets where it's at for that."
"21626110","21627190"," So it's time passes. "
"21628290","21629170"," People get greedy."
"21629950","21630830"," People are like, fuck it."
"21630890","21631510"," Let's make some money. "
"21634390","21635810"," That's just human, right?"
"21636110","21641610"," It's like a human aspect to our economy, to the stock market, greed."
"21656320","21657340"," Let's take a look right now."
"21657440","21657500"," Ready?"
"21659460","21659760"," Popular pattern. "
"21660660","21661100"," Right here."
"21665780","21669280"," Here's the bull or bear plane forming up."
"21669520","21671200"," I'll show it to you right now if you can't see it. "
"21671720","21674260"," I'll make it so you can see it better here."
"21674340","21674760"," Give me a second."
"21680170","21680690"," Okay. "
"21683030","21685110"," Here's the white and red line right here."
"21685450","21687590"," What does a bear want, right?"
"21690310","21694370"," Bear wants to see price stay below."
"21700090","21701830"," And this to cross down, right?"
"21702590","21706950"," And you want to see in the five minute chart price begin to trade or stay trading below. "
"21707230","21714490"," We know in the five minute chart, in the five minute chart of 27 EMA, we are bearish when price"
"21714490","21715530"," is below it, right?"
"21717770","21721650"," The price stays below the five minute 27 EMA."
"21722530","21723730"," We are bearish the spy."
"21729120","21730180"," See you right there. "
"21733720","21741040"," Now, the second question becomes, when we start to trade sideways, and these lines flatten out,"
"21741040","21742620"," will it reverse?"
"21745220","21745940"," Makes sense."
"21746520","21749320"," The price comes up and starts to reverse higher into this close."
"21750220","21751720"," And I'm squeezing up here into this close. "
"21752060","21755540"," So the question becomes, how do we know if that's the case?"
"21755780","21756840"," So we're going to go to the VIX real quick."
"21757400","21759960"," VIX looks like it's consolidating like it wants to trade higher."
"21760480","21762100"," It is below the one minute right now. "
"21762160","21762980"," That's not bullish."
"21764740","21772360"," We want to see, for a real true bloodbath, we want to see the VIX trade above $16.39. So"
"21772360","21779380"," I'm not extremely bearish here on this five minute bearish, but not extremely bearish here."
"21780380","21786580"," And even in this bearishness, I'm going to be looking for this pivot down here to be the support so"
"21786580","21786840"," far. "
"21787780","21792960"," I really like to see this break below this to get my real true bear on down here."
"21793660","21795320"," This is the 15 minute chart."
"21798540","21804440"," I wonder if they do begin to sell this tomorrow early, and not at 1 o'clock, 3.30 in"
"21804440","21804740"," the afternoon. "
"21805860","21807420"," Let's take a look at what the earnings are for tomorrow."
"21808220","21810300"," So we'll go back to this five minute chart so you can see it."
"21810300","21811540"," It's right there. "
"21812160","21812920"," The bearish close."
"21815140","21821460"," We know the implied move is $4.15.11 on the day outside of the zero date market, just the"
"21821460","21822180"," options market."
"21823420","21825180"," Let's see if we can get some weakness in this close. "
"21825480","21830540"," We want to see price on VIX get above $16.02, which is beginning to do now."
"21831420","21842060"," We want to see VIX trade to $16.39. Head"
"21842060","21843700"," and shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes."
"21847040","21848880"," Let's take a look at the 15 minute chart here. "
"21852000","21858000"," Got a nice gap to fill down below at 405, 406.01. We know S3 is down below here at"
"21858000","21863420"," 408.41. S2's 409.90. S1 way down here."
"21863560","21865380"," Trade all the way down to 412 down here."
"21866100","21867600"," Just another opportunity to buy the dip. "
"21869100","21872920"," This bloop, this green box is where I was like, yeah, I really want to buy that, right?"
"21873120","21874480"," I was like, I really want to buy that green box."
"21874900","21875840"," You guys can't see that shit."
"21876000","21876240"," Hold on. "
"21877920","21880720"," They go over here talking a bunch of shit to you and you guys aren't even listening."
"21881180","21881820"," I can't even see."
"21891020","21892960"," Nice consolidation down here, right?"
"21893480","21895540"," Trade up, consolidate, support, right?"
"21895920","21898200"," Known buyers, known buyers, right?"
"21900000","21902940"," Demand, demand, demand, right?"
"21903900","21905820"," We know right now there's demand there. "
"21906660","21908000"," We know that there's demand."
"21908340","21911800"," Well, currently we know that there's demand down here, right?"
"21912140","21917120"," We know the buyers are down here."
"21917860","21920220"," We know that the sellers are above, right?"
"21920960","21922420"," They sold us down here. "
"21922600","21923820"," They got pushed back again."
"21923960","21925200"," They got pushed back again."
"21926460","21926520"," Right?"
"21927080","21928780"," We know the sellers are above here. "
"21942370","21944730"," If you're a buyer, where do you want to be a buyer?"
"21945010","21946350"," Of course, it's on a low down below."
"21946990","21948410"," I guess we can make this green."
"21951950","21956250"," Early marks on close, imbalanced, 614 million to the buy side. "
"21956770","21961430"," There's also something else in here, and this is this little zone right here."
"21972110","21973970"," It's spent a lot of time in here, right?"
"21975510","21977330"," Solidate, consolidate, consolidate."
"21978010","21979270"," Push it up, right?"
"21980070","21983910"," Trying to break above, tag this high up here. "
"21984430","21985910"," A lot of buyers down in here."
"21986010","21987350"," I want you to be aware of that down here."
"21987490","21988710"," A lot of buyers. "
"21989170","21992170"," These buyers in here, they're not looking for 417."
"21993290","21994550"," These buyers looking for 420."
"21995430","21996190"," That's they're looking for. "
"21996350","21999170"," They're looking to get up there, tag that, take their money, and run."
"21999510","21999770"," Make sense?"
"22000930","22002010"," Do they get that tomorrow?"
"22003730","22007510"," Or do they get that on the rate decision?"
"22010090","22011070"," It's the big question."
"22011250","22012810"," It's now 331 in the afternoon. "
"22014670","22018490"," So the question becomes, do we get up into this 421?"
"22019250","22021070"," Do they panic sell it, right?"
"22021350","22022250"," Do they get up here tomorrow?"
"22022610","22024530"," We get woo hoo, bunch of bulls getting crazy."
"22025310","22028010"," They tease you with getting up into this 420, right?"
"22029130","22030690"," They make you think we're going here tomorrow."
"22031210","22033510"," And then what they do is they chop your balls off. "
"22034590","22040030"," And we trade down into the decision, the rate decision, right?"
"22040690","22042170"," And there's some scariness in here."
"22042950","22045190"," This is all you have for support in here, right?"
"22045330","22046770"," This is pretty weak support."
"22047550","22051770"," So if we get a rate increase, they pull the rug on you right here, right?"
"22051970","22055970"," And we start blasting lower on Wednesday, right?"
"22056150","22061550"," So the question then becomes, if you're a bear, if you're even a bull trying to hedge this event,"
"22061550","22062890"," where is your hedge at?"
"22063450","22064630"," Is it right here at 417?"
"22065450","22066410"," Is it up here at 418?"
"22067790","22069710"," Are you super bullish that we're going to 421?"
"22069830","22072590"," Is it a rate pause where we squeeze all the way up to 421?"
"22073830","22076930"," I think just where we are in the market right now. "
"22077910","22082030"," Just where breath is, where the spy is, where may is."
"22082610","22087810"," We know that coming into the fifth, historically, we'll see some weakness."
"22089530","22095330"," With the ball that we have coming up this week, FOMC should provide that. "
"22095690","22098770"," We talked about the other events that could provide that volatility."
"22098790","22103230"," If we don't get it from the Fed meeting, when does that ball come in?"
"22103850","22106330"," You know, trying to short into the meeting is kind of a challenge."
"22106330","22109050"," You get locked in trying to take puts. "
"22109290","22115270"," You get like, like, they take your money, they take your bet, and then they force you to hold it"
"22115270","22116190"," through the event, right?"
"22116190","22121850"," You're like, I'm all locked in, and then you don't see anything happen until the rate hike."
"22122150","22128190"," The one fear here is the moment that volatility comes off of the event, compressed volatility, then"
"22128190","22129330"," it squeezes up, right?"
"22129510","22131590"," The event fall comes off or it squeezes up."
"22131770","22137970"," And here the event fall comes up, needs something materialistically different from the FOMC"
"22137970","22138190"," meeting. "
"22138450","22146170"," If we know that we're going to get a rate hike, then that volatility is known, right?"
"22146710","22152010"," That's what you need to start breaking below this zone down here, right?"
"22152130","22154150"," This rug pull, right?"
"22154830","22160510"," So right here, right now, if we know what's going to happen on Monday, or excuse me, on Wednesday,"
"22160550","22167150"," on Tuesday, Wednesday, if we know what's going to happen in here, well, it's Tuesday, Wednesday,"
"22167410","22167530"," right?"
"22168870","22174950"," If we know what's going to happen into Wednesday, then we get a dip down here."
"22175730","22177290"," I'm going to want to buy that right there."
"22177630","22180030"," I don't think that they pull the rug on you down here. "
"22181350","22186510"," I don't think they pull the rug on you down here just based on a 50 BPS rate hike."
"22186650","22189070"," Maybe you get 410, something like that."
"22189210","22191510"," You need something unknown out of that meeting. "
"22192730","22194250"," Something unknown out of that meeting."
"22194250","22201310"," Otherwise, the way is up in my view, at least into the third or fifth, something like that."
"22202430","22204490"," We are weak into this close right now, 334. "
"22205970","22210390"," There is a five minute bear flag above here, our baro plane."
"22210550","22213010"," That's a bear flag, but baro plane forming right here."
"22213690","22217130"," Bears probably are going to say we're going to chase the hole or something like that. "
"22217130","22221410"," They're going to tell you, I don't like chasing the hole personally right now."
"22222070","22224630"," If you want to chase this hole into the close, you can."
"22225130","22226790"," I would recommend that you close it. "
"22227730","22228650"," Hold on a second here."
"22228650","22236850"," I would recommend that you close."
"22237890","22239230"," Watch it happen today. "
"22239430","22240070"," Watch it happen today."
"22240150","22244250"," Unlike other times."
"22244570","22245630"," Hold on a second here. "
"22251060","22256060"," Unlike other times historically, like in front of bear market, you can usually chase these holes"
"22256060","22256640"," down here."
"22257840","22260740"," You can chase this stuff down and hold it into the open tomorrow."
"22261200","22262220"," I don't know that I would. "
"22262460","22264580"," I have had zero success doing that."
"22264580","22271220"," I watch this stuff every close, like when you're chasing holes here, we tend to open strong the"
"22271220","22272400"," next day, tend to."
"22273300","22274900"," Chasing holes has been a challenge. "
"22291200","22292540"," Give me just one second here."
"22340790","22341490"," Sorry about that."
"22354190","22355910"," Beautiful bear flag right now. "
"22357870","22361530"," Beautiful bear flag right now."
"22365050","22369490"," Vicks now trading up to 16, 10, 3.37 in the afternoon."
"22388900","22406480"," Vicks trading above its one and five minute trigger, moving its way up to 16.39. We're"
"22406480","22408320"," almost in bond season right now, aren't we?"
"22408600","22410900"," Look at T.L.T. just blasting lower right now. "
"22411500","22412840"," Thanks for saying something Lane."
"22413060","22420800"," T.L.T. on 102.87. Hopefully we can get it back down to 98 bucks."
"22422200","22424220"," We're almost in bond season Lane. "
"22424360","22424840"," You know that right?"
"22425820","22426660"," Middle of May."
"22435080","22436420"," Yeah, I like SOXs."
"22441860","22445900"," I'm hoping to take that long T.L.T. trade with you Lane. "
"22460960","22473790"," Vicks now trading 16.23, making its way up to the hourly trigger at 16.39. Bloodbath"
"22473790","22483710"," in T.L.T. went on T.L.T. T "
"22483710","22487750",".L.T. I was thinking about it this morning."
"22487990","22491370"," I have to look closer, but I was looking at the seasonality of bonds."
"22492590","22497690"," They were saying that we're not there yet, but we're coming into bond season. "
"22499190","22500610"," We're almost in bond season."
"22501170","22502210"," So I hope we can get it down."
"22502210","22506170"," If we can get it down to 98 bucks, I think Winky likes buying it down there too. "
"22513990","22516890"," Yeah dude, I want T.L.T. Let me see if I can show it."
"22517550","22518030"," I want a second here."
"22533590","22534670"," You guys ready for it?"
"22535050","22535390"," I think tighter. "
"22540320","22541860"," So just right there."
"22545000","22547700"," Nope, hold on a second."
"22550860","22555360"," Early marks on close imbalance, 428 million to the buy side. "
"22561250","22562250"," Just right here."
"22564990","22567250"," Treasury bonds right there."
"22567550","22571450"," May 12th. "
"22571450","22573970"," Right around May 12th, May 5th, May 12th, somewhere in there."
"22574230","22575110"," Start getting your eyes."
"22575670","22577470"," This is just with the accumulation phase. "
"22578170","22580490"," Lasts until October 7th."

"22605870","22609490"," You see the 27 crossing over the 113 right now?"
"22609670","22611170"," Gorgeous cross over right now. "
"22617150","22620470"," Yes, seasonally May 12th is the season for it."
"22620590","22622170"," You buy and hold until October."
"22634970","22636010"," Yeah, I don't know. "
"22636230","22637150"," I can't."
"22638350","22640290"," I think these closes have been outstanding."
"22640830","22642350"," Like when we sell the clothes like this. "
"22643750","22644890"," It's been great."
"22647170","22649570"," But not so much the next morning."
"22652210","22653550"," Like selling these clothes. "
"22653790","22655370"," Like chasing the whole end of the bell is."
"22655630","22657390"," You can chase it to like 415."
"22658410","22661630"," But if you chase it into tomorrow's open and typically. "
"22662250","22663870"," I haven't had great success."
"22664270","22665070"," I don't do it anymore."
"22665270","22665850"," I used to do it. "
"22666430","22670890"," And I'm talking like past six months or so."
"22670890","22672770"," If I still watch it."
"22673910","22676610"," To see what to see what happens the next morning. "
"22676610","22677510"," It's usually up."
"22678970","22684050"," So if you trade that follow this into the bell here by morning, it's like just higher."
"22685510","22691910"," Like you'll get like you'll get like futures will sell down, but then it recovers by the time we"
"22691910","22692390"," get into cash. "
"22693030","22693450"," Does it make sense?"
"22693830","22694990"," Like futures will sell it lower."
"22695790","22699410"," The cash market won't and it just it just sucks."
"22704860","22708020"," So Vic's now coming into it's hourly trigger. "
"22709060","22729130"," Early trigger is right now currently it's $16.40. Let"
"22729130","22732010"," me know in the chat if you're willing to chase this into the bell here."
"22732170","22733310"," I'm fascinated to know."
"22736450","22738110"," I want to know if this is a bear trap. "
"22738450","22739550"," I think it's a bear trap."
"22740650","22741270"," It's hard."
"22741990","22745550"," So when I'm looking at the Vic's right now. "
"22745550","22747710"," I don't think it's a bear trap."
"22748010","22749030"," I think it's a word."
"22749270","22750610"," I think it's worth the trade. "
"22751990","22754190"," Into the bell, but fuck man."
"22754470","22756810"," Like these setups have not panned out."
"22758010","22760770"," Like this setup is primed to short the close. "
"22761230","22764190"," Well, that's short clothes and futures like cash market."
"22764610","22765780"," It's like a prime cash market."
"22766450","22768330"," Buy some fucking puts up here. "
"22769750","22771950"," Like this is a this is a prime setup."
"22772930","22778950"," Like trade this shit down in tomorrow, but these fucking things haven't these fucking things have"
"22778950","22779470"," been bullshit."
"22783230","22784170"," They've been bullshit. "
"22784170","22784690"," I promise."
"22786530","22788210"," Like these setups on a normal circumstance."
"22788690","22789550"," They're like this is fucking awesome. "
"22789830","22791830"," We're in a short or we're going to buy a bunch of puts for tomorrow."
"22792170","22794990"," Like this is like zero date or one date today."
"22795130","22795670"," They're one dates. "
"22796550","22799050"," But zero but one dates for tomorrow to be zero dates."
"22799050","22801630"," Like this is like a prime setup for tomorrow to go down."
"22802110","22806450"," But like yeah, like FOMC. "
"22807070","22811190"," I don't know man."
"22811870","22815930"," I haven't looked today, but I don't recall the White House press."
"22816510","22820430"," I don't recall many blood baths into FOMC rate decisions. "
"22821030","22821290"," Am I wrong?"
"22821510","22821810"," Let me know."
"22822070","22824410"," Like do we usually blood bath into the rate decision?"
"22824670","22825770"," I swear that we don't."
"22829130","22829810"," Yeah, dude. "
"22829850","22830550"," I'm not like a."
"22837540","22841140"," No, I like I always feel like I feel like these FOMC rate decisions."
"22841180","22842340"," They pin it sideways."
"22844120","22846300"," They both think we're going to blow. "
"22846600","22848820"," We trade higher into the Tuesday."
"22849940","22852640"," Till like one in the afternoon and then bulls are all bulls."
"22853000","22853260"," Just fuck. "
"22853580","22856220"," And they just hammer it down into the clothes."
"22857220","22858680"," But they don't pay the prints."
"22859100","22861240"," I think they pay the puts on Wednesday morning open. "
"22861240","22862780"," They don't pay the."
"22863300","22868300"," They get the all the bulls look like fucking long as fucking trapped."
"22869160","22872080"," They bleed those bulls out into Wednesday. "
"22874960","22878440"," And then everybody's walking the plank, including the bears and the bulls."
"22878820","22882340"," And then you of course see the shorts closed right before like 11 30."
"22882940","22884780"," One between 11 30 and 130. "
"22886340","22889160"," So I'm probably going to stay day trading wise."
"22889300","22890880"," I'm not going to get some puts down here."
"22890880","22892740"," I'm calling this. "
"22892880","22894320"," I'm calling this a bear trap."
"22895700","22897620"," I don't know if we weren't doing FMC."
"22898320","22900620"," I'd be like fucking short this shit into the hole. "
"22903780","22906420"," But FOMC I'm like, yeah, I don't know man."
"22915370","22915790"," Pfizer."
"22916370","22918230"," We might be a better answer to that. "
"22918370","22920070"," Might have a better answer to that one than me at the moment."
"22924940","22926780"," Yeah, futures have sucked too, right?"
"22926780","22928440"," I've heard that complaint."
"22929820","22931180"," They've been good and bad. "
"22931420","22933060"," Well, two weeks ago when I wasn't streaming."
"22934180","22937860"," There were some really good futures trades."
"22941280","22945320"," But this bull shit back here like this nonsense right here. "
"22946280","22948080"," Like get fucked on that stuff."
"22948360","22949720"," That's just data torch."
"22950920","22952500"," That's some gnarly shit right there. "
"22953320","22954760"," That's what I don't want to happen."
"22954760","22958320"," But I don't want to see like this kind of fucking nonsense."
"22958920","22962420"," They squeeze it up tomorrow, one o'clock and then they sell that shit down. "
"22963940","22965820"," So I'm not going to partake of this."
"22966500","22971740"," I'm going to stay flat and I'll tell you this."
"22973440","22975500"," Under any normal circumstances, right?"
"22976540","22977400"," You buy puts here. "
"22979160","22981180"," Normal, normal, normal day of the week."
"22981180","22984300"," If we were closing like this right now."
"22985900","22990000"," I'd be like fucking zero dates, 30 deltas. "
"22991260","22993400"," Make a burr right open tomorrow."
"22995500","22997280"," That's what I'd be saying right here."
"22999600","23001420"," Like make that shit burr. "
"23001840","23002880"," I can't do it right now."
"23004940","23009040"," This whole past month has been like."
"23010180","23014260"," This whole past month has been like land mines. "
"23014500","23016140"," You guys don't see the land mines everywhere."
"23016600","23018220"," Like am I the only one?"
"23019140","23024380"," Like setups just like not not printing fake outs on setups."
"23025080","23026280"," Like this is a setup right here. "
"23026780","23031600"," This is like a classic setup to trade this shit to the depths of hell tomorrow."
"23032740","23036680"," Under any other circumstance, I'd be like fucking puts into the bell on this shit."
"23045020","23048720"," Yeah, yeah, it has been, well, it hasn't just been worthless. "
"23049120","23052040"," The selling that they do recovers by the open."
"23056230","23058190"," These are fucking dealers, man."
"23059070","23060970"," These are fucking dealers, man. "
"23061230","23063510"," Dealers are ruthless right now."
"23064250","23064830"," Ruthless."
"23069060","23070480"," Ruthless dealers right now. "
"23074030","23076070"," Oh, dude, the dealers, man."
"23076410","23082050"," Like I was on the phone with Joe Harper last week or winky or someone and I was like, I'm"
"23082050","23084070"," going to show you exactly what they're doing right now."
"23085230","23086990"," Like it was fucking brutal. "
"23091200","23093120"," It was it was gnarly."
"23093440","23095340"," Like they were just sweeping up money."
"23103590","23105570"," Like this right here, this clothes right here. "
"23105990","23107110"," This is any other day."
"23107190","23110110"," I'd be like fucking short this to the depths of hell."
"23111950","23113350"," Depth of hell. "
"23116130","23121450"," Yeah, you can't short that fucking hourly trend man is still up right here."
"23125350","23127610"," Like I'm looking for like daily bearishness."
"23129530","23130830"," 15 minute bearishness. "
"23132770","23134710"," The five minute is the only hint."
"23136050","23137470"," The only bearish."
"23138730","23143090"," Trey, I mean, a normal circumstances, I'd say, sell this clothes. "
"23144070","23145810"," For where we are with prices right now."
"23147010","23148410"," I'm going to stay flat."
"23148590","23149610"," I don't want to get caught in this shit. "
"23150990","23151830"," Like real money."
"23152710","23155810"," I'm currently sitting at 470 million to the buy side."
"23155810","23157930"," Just waiting for the final orders before we cool it. "
"23159350","23160530"," Oh, there's a buddy."
"23162650","23163530"," I'm yawning."
"23165050","23167190"," 90 million to the buy side. "
"23167870","23171030"," Did you guys like any of you that have been here all day along with me?"
"23171130","23177170"," We went through like Dixie, H.Y.G. I mean, we're looking at the charts earlier today and like"
"23177170","23181490"," they're all given false readings, like everything, H.Y.G., Dixie, VIX."
"23182070","23184230"," Like you can't trust the most of it today."
"23184490","23187050"," Like we were like, we were like, I don't trust this. "
"23188210","23190130"," I don't trust that right now."
"23198760","23201660"," So I don't know, like normally sell this clothes."
"23202880","23208920"," For me, going to stay flat and be all open to whatever the market, whatever the market opens that"
"23208920","23209880"," tomorrow open for. "
"23210640","23212420"," I'm not giving any money away right now."
"23218370","23218810"," Yeah."
"23219430","23228010"," So the last like, uh, two weeks, last two weeks, the fuckery was, it's not just fuckery. "
"23228150","23230590"," You can, you can see what they're doing."
"23230830","23236310"," You can, you can actually see when they did follow through on it, um, what you could actually see"
"23236310","23237490"," in the morning when they do it."
"23238150","23241850"," If we're going to have follow through, you can see it at about four 15 in the morning. "
"23242570","23247190"," So I do wake up at four 15 still every morning and watch to see if they buy it or"
"23247190","23247790"," if they sell it."
"23248670","23252190"," Uh, and you can actually see when they do sell it, you'll see it right around four."
"23252350","23255090"," You can actually, you'll know it four 15 if they're going to sell it or not. "
"23256430","23257830"," Four or five, four 15."
"23260870","23262090"," With a fuckery, man."
"23262270","23264570"," I don't know if I'm just getting old. "
"23287620","23288860"," What about a fubo for tomorrow?"
"23294900","23296900"," Man, that fubo trade was nice, wasn't it?"
"23298940","23300760"," It was a good fucking trade, huh?"
"23301320","23302540"," That was that fucking fubo trade."
"23302700","23304080"," That fucking shit was awesome sauce."
"23306140","23307740"," I'm bullish on fubo. "
"23308220","23309360"," Right now I am."
"23310620","23317300"," Uh, I become not bullish on fubo."
"23321300","23327920"," Uh, stops on $1.22. Uh, you can lower them. "
"23328100","23349120"," Stop selling $1.17. It stops on $1.17. Yeah,"
"23349240","23352260"," man, under normal circumstances, dude, like zero date puts for tomorrow."
"23353620","23355080"," A hundred fucking percent."
"23356120","23357960"," Let's look at what the options market's saving tomorrow. "
"23359700","23361000"," Yeah, we could be down tomorrow."
"23361160","23362920"," We got 200,000 call buyers."
"23364700","23367560"," We got 200,000 calls on four 17. "
"23371870","23374490"," If we were to sell this hourly, let's get spy real quick."
"23375810","23377310"," If we were to sell this close tomorrow."
"23382570","23383490"," Man, I don't know. "
"23390190","23391870"," I'm going to fucking torch sellers."
"23396390","23397490"," That's my take, airman."
"23403290","23406110"," I think if they sell futures, it's going to get bought at five. "
"23406290","23407290"," I agree with whoever said that."
"23407890","23408710"," I agree with that statement."
"23408710","23416300"," I think we're weak in the overnight and it recovers by open. "
"23422040","23424140"," I don't think cash market puts prints."
"23424540","23425360"," I don't think that they do."
"23427040","23436310"," I think you can probably short futures. "
"23437150","23438510"," Not short futures, but."
"23441800","23445760"," I think yes, you could sell some contracts in the overnight."
"23447880","23449780"," But I don't think it holds. "
"23453300","23454620"," I'm going to get a yes really quick."
"23465600","23467120"," Yeah, if you're a futures trader."
"23468720","23469160"," Man. "
"23479230","23485380"," Man, that's a juicy fucking trade."
"23488640","23490320"," That is a juicy fucking trade."
"23492360","23494240"," Make sure futures like 4166. "
"23495820","23497860"," Here's definitely a short in here for future."
"23498020","23500000"," If you're a futures trader out there, tell all your friends."
"23500000","23503660"," It's probably a really good fucking short overnight. "
"23504340","23506060"," I just wouldn't be committed to it."
"23507280","23508400"," Wouldn't fall in love with it."
"23521270","23522470"," Yeah, I like Rocket Lab. "
"23522710","23523730"," That's a buy and hold for me."
"23525410","23527230"," I plan on holding that for a few years."
"23528430","23533650"," There's actually a bunch of space companies that I'm trying to buy right now. "
"23535790","23539690"," And I was looking at those this early this morning."
"23539690","23541670"," I was looking at these companies to add to the portfolio."
"23560590","23564930"," Yeah, we got 4172 in what?"
"23565450","23566490"," April 4th?"
"23567650","23569010"," That was a month ago, right?"
"23570610","23571870"," Didn't we get it a month ago?"
"23572890","23579050"," We got almost 418 on April 1st or something. "
"23582990","23584370"," It was April 1st."
"23594580","23598020"," What is the 250 candle always act so weirdly?"
"23599280","23600780"," We can talk about that."
"23601600","23603640"," Pay a brie ball. "
"23605980","23607200"," Brie ball, though."
"23607720","23608720"," Can you bring up tomorrow?"
"23610460","23614140"," And I want to describe too about hourly prints."
"23615120","23619700"," The beginning of an hourly print and the end of an hourly print. "
"23620900","23627780"," And price, behavior, look at those buyers coming in right now."
"23630740","23632280"," Can you bring that up tomorrow?"
"23632720","23639760"," Because I want to show you examples of price interaction on the hourly print if you can remind me."
"23652770","23653750"," Two minutes left. "
"23654310","23660010"," I'll be back with you again tomorrow at 9.30. Let me know in the comments if you are holding"
"23660010","23661570"," puts into tomorrow."
"23662150","23666250"," I don't think that that's going to print for you if you're trading this for cash market."
"23666490","23667510"," I think the trade is higher. "
"23668250","23671690"," We got the implied move on the upside, the implied move on the downside."
"23672790","23676030"," I think we trade higher into 1.30, 3.30 in the afternoon tomorrow."
"23676650","23679790"," There might be a trade for Globex traders in the overnight. "
"23680010","23681710"," You might be able to get a scam sell on the overnight."
"23682790","23685110"," I was looking at the VIX right now."
"23686930","23693950"," You're going to want to hope that VIX will trade above 16.42. And hopefully it can trade up to"
"23693950","23695250"," 18.29 in the overnight. "
"23695670","23699710"," But otherwise sell the vol, baby."
"23699970","23701170"," Sell VIX."
"23701910","23704050"," Give me $14 in the VIX. "
"23704250","23709710"," How says you will hear something in the very near future on Biden's choice for the Fed Vice Chair?"
"23712150","23718510"," I will see you guys tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. Get free daily points, Fibonacci and market profile"
"23718510","23721230"," levels by signing up to the tick."
"23721430","23722670"," Yeah, you think it gaps up in Fed?"
"23723010","23729110"," Yeah, I'm not into the volatility heading into this rate decision at all."
"23730030","23731070"," I ain't buying it. "
"23732450","23737070"," Every time they come in with these rate decisions, they get bulls hopes up and they trap their"
"23737070","23737350"," asses."
"23738550","23742090"," I think they start like 1.30 in the afternoon tomorrow."
"23742090","23748370"," I'm interested in shorting 1.30. Like hold some shit into Wednesday. "
"23749650","23750890"," Alright, I'll see you guys all tomorrow."
"23751130","23751830"," Thanks for showing up."
"23752730","23754290"," I'm back from vacation, baby. "
