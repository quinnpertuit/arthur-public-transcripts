"113680","116520"," We had those EOG comments that wouldn't go back to the perspective of the good companies saying"
"116520","118420"," there's going to be decline in growth."
"118600","123300"," Remember, it's not at the decline in growth in the U.S. I don't believe that, but I have to,"
"123560","125260"," I think that EOG is too conservative. "
"126040","129400"," But there is, but in all this, why isn't oil at 80?"
"129759","135180"," I mean, the market seems to be taking this stuff in stride for the moment."

"166920","169120"," I mean, it's not doing anything. "
"169900","175300"," And I was saying, you know, look, Herb Jordan, I know that you're supposed to be the way to play"
"175300","176620"," this, but it's not moving."

"238580","239940"," And so far, I don't want to dignify it. "
"240060","243280"," But what what does matter is is that some of the stores had bad numbers."

"284700","287800"," can see that the charge says, well, that's an unbelievable move. "
"288540","292420"," And that's a reverse, you know, it's reverse head and shoulder."
"292720","293900"," So all of me is going to be okay."

"301220","302580"," That's just a really great company."
"302860","304580"," And when it rolls over, you buy it. "
"304660","305500"," And that's what you do."
"305860","310880"," And look, if you really want to, you want to just combine chipotle, because that's not chipotle and"

"312340","315000"," And it's like, hey, we're on a sale, but you can't sell us. "
"315300","316460"," We're like, great, chipotle."
"320360","324360"," Because those are two gross stocks that people just simply say by."
"325060","329540"," And I feel the same way about McDonald's, but it's obviously these are chipotle's. "
"329820","333060"," No, I read the other day, I looked at it."
"333720","339640"," Doing me about the works with me showed me all the different grades that all the chipotle's have in"
"339640","340020"," the city."
"340660","341200"," They're all eight. "
"341760","344480"," I mean, everyone I think close the store up is not an A."
"344660","346960"," By the way, don't look at carbon because you might want to sell carbon."
"347720","348100"," Really?"
"348380","348980"," Yeah, interesting."
"349280","350000"," Don't look at carbon. "

"513360","516120"," down to three seven nine, let's say on a close. "
"516900","518120"," We got to four 10 this morning."
"518280","522780"," That's the best since December 13th, but now backing off to Jim's point as people take a closer"
"522780","524680"," look at the internals of this jobs number."
"524980","526760"," We'll get the opening bell in about five minutes. "

"717030","718510"," It's constantly supported today."
"718630","719050"," S T C."
"719270","719970"," They're going to be on tonight."
"720170","721230"," It's the tale of two cities. "
"721550","722590"," Beer is just incredible."
"722930","724450"," I cannot believe how strong beer is."
"724650","728870"," There are particular beers are doing amazing much better than we have actually above today. "
"728890","732050"," But if you want to kill it, you want to buy modello and modello, especially."
"732270","739570"," However, people are just wine and spirits not going to continue to believe that the most challenged"
"739570","746230"," category in this year of 2024 will be the browns and the tears of hard legs."
"746950","750910"," People don't want to gin, they don't want vodka, they don't want whiskey and people have to start"
"750910","753010"," understanding that bourbon sales are going to be down. "
"753650","758410"," And also they're they've got some good wines, but it's a tale to the they're going to have to"
"759610","759970"," spirits."
"759970","762030"," I'm going to propose that to bill new ones tonight."
"762390","763890"," You want them to spin on ourselves?"
"764650","765130"," Whoever's here. "
"765250","770350"," But they, by the way, Elliot, Elliot barbers is in there and I'm sure that they feel the same."
"770510","771890"," But I think bill new ones feels that way."
"772090","779170"," I just don't know if there's a buyer, the the man who ran that division kind of mysteriously left"
"779170","781370"," and bill took it over yesterday. "
"781770","783290"," But it is incredible."
"783750","785050"," This is nothing to do with them."
"785230","791550"," This is by the way, it's only going to get worse with GLP because the taste of whiskey is a"
"791550","793050"," unique like water, it tell me. "
"793810","797470"," But on if you're on GLP it's yeah, it's like whiskey water."
"797830","801730"," Remember years ago when the fortune cover was, are we in a bourbon bubble?"
"802070","804130"," Oh my, you think it's the opposite of that?"
"804130","804890"," Yeah, and they're companies."
"805390","807930"," They're actual banks that got caught with barrel fushers. "
"808310","809430"," They're like too long barrels."
"809910","815770"," But there is, I think people plus the Chinese are not buying the very expensive."
"816570","817090"," Oh, yes. "
"817770","818450"," Forget it."
"818530","819170"," I mean, don't."
"819170","825310"," Well, you and I talked to you today about the potential impact of cannabis on alcohol sales. "
"825310","826030"," Don't kill it."
"826150","828910"," And now the rumors this week of all this DEA rescheduling."
"829270","832930"," Yeah, no, I mean, can't now, of course, constantly some brands on speech. "
"832950","834390"," Do not buy candy."
"834910","835450"," There's nothing there."
"835750","836590"," I think there's nothing there. "
"836850","841010"," I don't want to recommend anything I'm going to do with cannabis."
"841330","843970"," Oh, it's really hurting the balance, yeah."
"844930","845490"," Really hurting. "
"846690","847470"," I watched that."
"847870","850310"," We'll just get the opening bell here in the CDC real common chain."
"850750","856590"," Speaking of beer, at the big board today, it's the professional bull riders and anhyzer celebrating"
"856590","861010"," the partnership of the sports competition at MSG this weekend at the NASDAQ. "
"861010","866490"," It's XBP, Europe, a payments technology company celebrating recent listening to its back."
"866670","868270"," What a pincer moving by bun."
"868530","869570"," Just professional bull riders. "
"870010","872530"," That's PBR, my favorite brand."
"873190","874270"," Yeah, get PBR."
"874490","875070"," They're really great. "
"875350","877470"," I assume you mentioned the medellos."
"877890","879970"," That's the swing factor in this beer guy."
"880090","880710"," Look at this. "
"880870","883110"," You know, we're talking about 11."
"883550","885250"," We're talking about numbers for the beer."
"885430","886890"," Beer is not being affected. "
"887370","888910"," Medellos, especially outgrew 12%."
"888910","892210"," Beer is not being affected by their beers."
"892550","896610"," Their beers are doing great, which is why you would think the stock if they missed the years per"
"896610","897730"," share would be down 10%. "
"897730","900350"," But no, because beer is great."
"900590","905770"," And if they do, we'll talk to Bill about it, find some buyer for their mid link."
"905990","909350"," That's you, by the way, they have a cost of nobody, which is a really fabulous tequila. "
"909810","910510"," And that's doing well."
"910610","912910"," And she keep that tequila, both is 11%."
"912910","915330"," The mess come both is 22% in the category. "
"916030","919470"," But forget it when it comes to wine is really slowing."
"920250","923330"," But hard liquor, they're high west, which is very good."
"923330","923870"," Delicious. "
"924250","924330"," Yeah."
"925090","929250"," Jim, we managed to open basically higher on the S&P, not by much."
"929390","930750"," Everyone's kind of fed up with seven. "
"931070","933750"," Look, we, I'm calling it early, 931."
"934150","935350"," There's like big cross cars."
"935770","938410"," Yeah, we ended the climb two days ago in the last eight minutes. "
"938710","939410"," Like, wow, what happened?"
"939910","943450"," There's just sellers, I think, who just have been waiting and waiting and waiting."
"944090","946070"," And any lift, they want to sell the Mag 7."
"946310","950610"," And I just say, well, guys, if things don't go down a straight line, we've been, this is a bad"
"950610","950910"," week."
"951690","954090"," There's a lot of people who are short those probably and they can bounce. "
"954850","957010"," Remember my couplings, Nvidia, that's a good luck."
"958030","962430"," Yeah, we used to do that when I'm trading desk, put rally caps on, do all this silly stuff."
"962730","967070"," Kind of like when I wore my same green shirt every day to the Eagles and we went to the"
"967070","971410"," Super Bowl, and I told Tammy Reed that the reason we did was because of my green shirt, and she"
"971410","972890"," says, we don't think anything to it. "
"973250","974390"," All right, maybe, maybe."
"974610","978330"," So it's like, there's a lot of superstition of the trading desk, but I do think that what's"
"978330","980770"," happening is that stocks just don't go straight down."
"981390","982730"," They just don't go straight down. "
"983130","987370"," I mean, Apple, every day, I mean, Loop Capital's a little late to the game of the negativity, given"
"987370","993230"," the fact that the Morgan Stanley Call is a very powerful call on the App Store, which everyone has"
"993230","996870"," dumped on the App Store, and it versus the Foxconn, which is a negative story."
"997190","999830"," So you're looking at the fact that stocks don't go straight down."
"999970","1000750"," That's all I'm saying. "
"1000950","1003370"," There's some impressive action in some semis."
"1003510","1005150"," AMD is the second biggest disappear."
"1005630","1010010"," It would be pretty hard last night because I think AMD really surprised people with their forecast. "
"1010810","1014730"," And remember I did this PC refresh thing with the Microsoft button?"
"1014910","1014970"," Yes."
"1015210","1017530"," It was so clear that everyone had me on mute."
"1017910","1018910"," They're like, mute him. "
"1019050","1022690"," He says PC refresh, but I think there will be a PC refresh."
"1023670","1026270"," We'll watch for some of the impact on some of those names."
"1026470","1027150"," Apple Costco. "
"1027470","1033550"," Yeah, I was going to say Costco, December comps, not just the comp gym, but discretionary non food"
"1033550","1035490"," with a nice 4%."
"1035490","1040170"," What is that something rich going to use the CFO who's just remarkable."
"1040869","1043050"," I asked a little quote about gold today. "
"1043470","1043970"," I bought my gold."
"1044510","1045589"," I bought my gold from Costco."
"1046470","1047970"," Yeah, well, like they finally came up. "
"1048070","1049130"," You finally can get some yesterday."
"1049170","1053250"," Oh, my, of course, like he shouldn't say, but they sold a hundred man in gold."
"1053470","1054350"," You can buy it. "
"1054550","1056570"," There was an article in the journal about why do it."
"1056750","1058670"," Well, how about the fact that there's no premium material?"
"1059050","1060690"," Like I'm an executive card member."
"1061090","1061290"," Okay. "
"1061650","1062570"," And I have the visa."
"1063250","1066470"," And I don't understand why everyone doesn't."
"1066550","1072390"," I mean, if car for banning Pepsi, why don't you go to Costco and you see real prices?"
"1073470","1075250"," And Costco is real price forever. "
"1075510","1077710"," Do you think help viewers understand?"
"1077950","1082630"," Yesterday, we talked about a XP being a shelter from the worst of the household balance sheet"
"1082630","1083330"," situation."
"1083330","1084390"," Is that a car?"
"1084550","1085870"," The same thing rhymes with Costco?"
"1086310","1087010"," I think so."
"1087310","1088870"," I mean, I always come, Shobber. "
"1088970","1093470"," Costco is always legendary by Captain Beemer's and Captain Mercedes in the lot."
"1093710","1094310"," Membership fees?"
"1094810","1097410"," Yeah, but it is this, you know, it's an amazing bargain."
"1097630","1100090"," Remember, they make it, they're doing special dividends. "
"1100630","1103870"," But the way they make the money's off the car, they want volume."
"1104470","1105890"," And I think people keep misunderstanding."
"1106650","1109730"," They want you to go there and beat them, so to speak. "
"1109930","1115090"," I remember when Jim Cinegal, I came in, I talked to Jim Cinegal when he opened this door in Harlem."
"1115290","1119450"," And he said, listen, you probably want to go and we've got some zanyas stuff over there."
"1119770","1121470"," And I was like, I said, I'm wearing zanyas. "
"1121570","1123370"," We had that thing for so much less."
"1123610","1125950"," You're like, Jay, I went over I bought some Costco ties."
"1126130","1127090"," I wore them for weeks. "
"1127510","1131850"," Mary Duffy, who's our, who's our, we didn't even know."
"1132010","1132550"," I was great at Costco."
"1132850","1133090"," Ha ha. "
"1134970","1136490"," Cinegal was one of the best."
"1136910","1138570"," Oh, I got a new guy."
"1139090","1142690"," I got to tell you that there is something to be said for. "
"1142790","1149630"," If you want to look at Costco, you get the economy, sundries, food, and a cooler where the"

"1155850","1160430"," Well, isn't that where we're really being heard at the supermarket?"
"1160750","1163070"," You want revenge, they have lower prices."
"1163570","1167010"," I think people should just stop, like, stop complaining, go to Costco, right?"
"1167030","1173030"," Okay, just to tie it back to the jobs number today, where you got wages up for one, inflation's"
"1173030","1173410"," three one. "
"1173750","1173870"," Right."
"1174050","1176790"," So you're, you're in a bit of a sweet spot on the consumer right now."
"1176850","1177170"," Thank you. "
"1177370","1177770"," Yes."
"1178070","1182290"," And that's why I say, I don't want to get negative because these are the numbers I want."
"1182370","1183990"," I'm really good at economy about that much inflation. "
"1184870","1186250"," Jay Powell's done a great job."
"1186250","1189290"," And I think that it's not perfect, perfect at the stock market."
"1189290","1194310"," But if you're worried about a recession, that's a mistake. "
"1194690","1194750"," Yeah."
"1195270","1201090"," The tape right now would definitely back that up, given the fact that Delta carnival on an upgrade"
"1201090","1202250"," today over as well."
"1202630","1206390"," What was interesting with it was the shuffle because Norwegian crews downgraded. "
"1206390","1207990"," And I thought that was just gratuitous."
"1207990","1208890"," They're doing well."
"1209490","1210830"," Royal's doing the best by the way. "
"1210910","1211850"," People want to play that group."
"1212410","1215230"," But I know that travel is still back."
"1215650","1217230"," It's still a great still works. "
"1217290","1220210"," And that's Boeing and GE take a longer term view."
"1220830","1223150"," Boeing, once again, top pick at Wells."
"1224350","1226190"," You know what the names I keep. "
"1226350","1227530"," I watch the top picks all week."
"1227890","1227950"," Yeah."
"1228070","1232770"," Boeing gets a bunch in video and Nike gets a ton again today out of UBS. "
"1232770","1234170"," What's your aim after you do it?"
"1234270","1235770"," Well, right?"
"1235970","1236470"," Isn't that terrific?"
"1236750","1237530"," That he's not doing well."
"1237670","1238070"," They get it."
"1238450","1243530"," I do look, if you want one of the ones that is, I think undervalued that people are saying"
"1243530","1249010"," realizing it's good and it's not up today, you got to focus on dominoes because Russell want to"
"1249010","1250270"," respect that thing humming again. "
"1250810","1256110"," And that is, I think, if you want to be in that food store, that restaurant story, it's that one."
"1256430","1258050"," You also, it's, by the way, it's great for you."
"1258210","1261210"," I was going to say, because we got to get another cut of pizza today. "
"1261510","1261870"," I know."
"1262010","1263210"," Really not happy one."
"1263690","1268390"," And we talked about another one yesterday is the Papa John's dominoes share shift. "
"1268390","1269250"," Do you think that's going on?"
"1270010","1271450"," Hard to say."
"1271910","1272850"," Yeah, I think it is."
"1273890","1275470"," Papa John's only has six ingredients. "
"1275730","1277750"," I like the pizza but I'm a total dominoes guy."
"1278270","1284450"," I mean, by the way, dominoes Russell has re-instituted and getting more and more technology again."
"1284590","1285450"," You kind of want to do that. "
"1286350","1292130"," But I just like the way his attitude is really starting to get the franchisees moving that too who"
"1292130","1292930"," drives that one."
"1293510","1294590"," So I like that."
"1294950","1296030"," That's my favorite of the group. "
"1298130","1303190"," Netflix, interesting piece in the journal this morning about gaming, looking for ways to make money"
"1303190","1309910"," and what they're calling a possible pivot in-game purchases, ads, charging extra for games."
"1309910","1311950"," Why not did you see the number of downloads?"
"1312770","1315130"," It was four times what it was the year before."
"1315530","1316830"," I think that they're absolutely right to do. "
"1316910","1318150"," It's a very forward-looking company."
"1318770","1324030"," And I think that they've got, by this time next year, they're going to certainly worth monetizing."
"1324330","1324410"," Right?"
"1326790","1327750"," Look, nothing's changed. "
"1328090","1332890"," You go to, you know, people say you're over, we have too many streamings."
"1334170","1336550"," If that's the case, why is Netflix doing so well?"
"1336690","1336790"," Right."
"1337110","1338230"," Although we have a way Apple Plus. "
"1338390","1342890"," I feel like we haven't tended the garden much on media this week, given how much conversation there"
"1342890","1346070"," was about Paramount, about Health and Disney earlier."
"1346070","1347430"," Well, you remember right about that."
"1347630","1348690"," What happened to that stuff?"
"1348950","1350670"," Disney, apparently, another couple of bad movies. "
"1350870","1355810"," I mean, Disney, Disney's, look, I think Nelson Feltz gets ammo every day."
"1356550","1363750"," I think like Pearl Mutter, who, you know, who built Marvel, has to be unhappy even the fact he's a"
"1363750","1364330"," huge shareholder."
"1365150","1366390"," And the stock does nothing. "
"1366930","1369030"," That is not going to endear."
"1369290","1372630"," I know that they have new people and I respect the new people."
"1372990","1378050"," But I do think that when you have a stock with the total shareholder return that is so bad, it"
"1378050","1382370"," does invite people who want to get on the board and who have shaken up other companies. "
"1382950","1384150"," And it tends to work."
"1384890","1386250"," I know that's very contrary with people."
"1387010","1391530"," Software, a couple of moves, Jeffries, I'm sorry, no, it's snow. "
"1392070","1393750"," RBC initiate outperform 230."
"1394510","1396510"," And then this downgraded Palantir over at Jeffries."
"1396970","1398650"," They go to underperform down to 13. "
"1399270","1399730"," I know."
"1400330","1401210"," Last quarter wasn't bad."
"1402210","1405590"," But that was their only, you know, they just love all that high multiple stuff. "
"1405810","1406550"," Oh my God."
"1406710","1408990"," They love monday.com hub spot."
"1409130","1412070"," If I saw an app or I was fucking build.com is incredibly expensive. "
"1412510","1413990"," They want those enterprise software stocks."
"1414110","1415910"," They never stop service now."
"1415970","1417510"," 650 goes to 775. "
"1417970","1419610"," You know, a must own for a growth stock."
"1419730","1422430"," I have the life service now, but let's just understand each other."
"1422810","1426290"," These are the stocks that get sold when interest rates go higher. "
"1426710","1432350"," They get sold until they report the quarters and they're good because that's what, you know, what"
"1432350","1435890"," if I, in your soul ran, they went tool and die."
"1436870","1437230"," It's okay."
"1437590","1437710"," Right. "
"1438090","1439170"," EMR. Yeah."
"1439750","1443370"," I don't really like EMR, but they like it right now. "
"1443610","1446970"," They meaning the institutional money managers who want to be in stuff."
"1447470","1449030"," Like I, I hadn't liked the stock of Honeywell."
"1449110","1452050"," They made a really good acquisition from carrier. "
"1452250","1452910"," I hadn't liked carrier."
"1453130","1454550"," They made a really good sale of Honeywell."
"1454650","1460010"," I mean, these companies can do no wrong and their multiples aren't that high at versus build.com."
"1460010","1460870"," I mean, come on. "
"1461550","1462450"," Monday.com."
"1462610","1463250"," They're expensive."
"1464310","1464830"," They're expensive."
"1465050","1467710"," I saw another positive comment about sales force. "
"1467870","1470490"," I've owned sales force for my travel trust since my channel basis."
"1470670","1471870"," My travels are starting."
"1472270","1473990"," I'm not pounding the table 30 times there is. "
"1474290","1474890"," I'm not."
"1475650","1477230"," I'm not, you know, Benny."
"1477390","1478870"," I'm probably is hoping to see him next week. "
"1478970","1479550"," I don't know."
"1479690","1480030"," He's not around."
"1480390","1481150"," But look at Mike Ponder. "
"1481350","1482210"," They upgraded Mike Ponder."
"1482470","1484590"," There were several positive piece about Mike Ponder."
"1484810","1486150"," All that happens the end of the day is to help. "
"1486230","1486370"," Yeah."
"1486570","1486690"," Yeah."
"1486830","1487770"," One of the laggards today. "
"1488270","1491990"," Speaking of quarters, a week from today, we're going to start getting the banks."
"1492830","1496910"," We'll talk about credit quality and funding costs and deposit flows."
"1497650","1498290"," Are you going?"
"1498610","1501890"," I mean, remember, we always talk about going into the quarter hot or cold. "
"1501890","1505190"," JPMorgan looks like Nvidia before the after the main quarter."
"1505470","1506070"," I mean, look at JPMorgan."
"1506990","1510710"," I mean, that is not now still sells only 10, 10 times earnings. "
"1511450","1512570"," But, you know, what pressure?"
"1513370","1515270"," Now, of course, they'll say, Jim, we're under no pressure."
"1515270","1517110"," So why don't you stop?"
"1517550","1517910"," No."
"1518850","1519710"," How's our show doing?"
"1520250","1521170"," I don't know. "
"1521250","1522410"," What time is the JP Morgan showing?"
"1522770","1523590"," Jamie, is he what?"
"1523710","1524250"," He's only 10?"
"1524910","1525150"," No."
"1525530","1526150"," I mean, I get to talk."
"1526290","1526650"," He doesn't. "
"1527210","1528690"," Jamie Donne, he's the CEO."
"1529010","1529950"," He does a really good job."
"1530170","1534390"," But that chart is the stock of a red hot seven meets AI. "
"1534990","1536630"," No, you know, it's a bank."
"1536990","1537910"," You're not saying it's overdone."
"1538230","1540670"," No, I'm just saying, like, we should run coming in so hot. "
"1541470","1544310"," Every number, every line item is going to be scrutinized."
"1544550","1547890"," And that's, by the way, Charlie Sharpe had a really great quarter."
"1547930","1548670"," That's Wells Fargo. "
"1549490","1550870"," And the stock's been good."
"1551130","1555070"," But, you know, the stock is still down substantially from where it was in 2018."
"1555610","1559090"," I prefer that way down from 2018. "
"1559390","1566750"," Sort of in that space in the Fintechi space, yet another downgrade today for PayPal as BTIG joins"
"1566750","1567930"," the chorus going to neutral."
"1568230","1568610"," Oh my God."
"1568730","1569830"," That's such a negative piece. "
"1570110","1570650"," 10 times earnings."
"1571530","1573290"," And yet they see no reason to buy it."
"1574190","1577090"," I invited Alex Chris on the show last night. "
"1577230","1577890"," He's the new CEO."
"1578290","1581870"," Chris Ben Stone and I were saying, listen, how do you, you can't slam it again."
"1582270","1584090"," Just invite the guy on to tell the story. "
"1586430","1590090"," Chris, Alex, we're on at 6 p.m. Just trying to give him a role."
"1590370","1591050"," Evening, your evening program."
"1591230","1591810"," Giving him an invite. "
"1592370","1593770"," And it's not an invite to his funeral."
"1594030","1594890"," It's an invite to tell the story."
"1595190","1595410"," Right, right. "
"1595850","1597590"," Sort of like you had with Lisa Gill last night."
"1597870","1599410"," Oh, look, I think Lisa's amazing."
"1599770","1604510"," And one of the things that I think, when CBS was in 50, she was saying, listen, load up the"
"1604510","1604670"," boat. "
"1604810","1605450"," That was a great call."
"1605890","1610030"," And she is so enamored of Walgreens here."
"1610750","1611270"," Walgreens. "
"1611930","1618710"," Because she believed, you get to stock at 23, that Tim Wentworth, as I do, CEO, is an amazing money"
"1618710","1621890"," manager, amazing money maker for money managers."
"1622390","1623250"," So watch Walgreens."
"1623610","1628910"," And there's also, there's so much about what's going on in so many different areas. "
"1629730","1633110"," Healthcare is probably the most in flux I have ever seen it."
"1633710","1635990"," And so many companies need to buy so many other companies."
"1636210","1639950"," But watch Walgreens, because this guy is a miracle worker. "
"1640390","1642310"," And we've said in the stand a little high for him now."
"1642550","1646650"," If you missed Lisa Gill and JP Morgan with Jim last night, sort of raising the curtain on the"
"1646650","1648390"," healthcare conference next week, take a listen."
"1649930","1653950"," One of the things to think about when you think about pharmacy, it's the highest touch point of"
"1653950","1654450"," anything in healthcare. "
"1655330","1658950"," It's been proven time and time again that if you can keep a patient here and on the medication."
"1659670","1660830"," And think about GLP ones, right?"
"1660990","1662250"," But it's all the rage right now."
"1664050","1664670"," Top of goal?"
"1664950","1665270"," Yes. "
"1665750","1668970"," And by the way, you know, there's a lot of misinformation about the ruling court yesterday."
"1669290","1671510"," And one of the reasons why the stock was up nine and finished down."
"1671930","1676770"," All they were saying was, look, we're going to use traditional places, touch places to get GLP one. "
"1677250","1679430"," But don't counterfeit, don't use counterfeit."
"1680010","1682070"," And don't use this if you're just trying to get thin."
"1682510","1683610"," We don't, we discourage it. "
"1683670","1685590"," Now you have a lot of stocks coming very hot there."
"1685590","1687810"," Regeneron is an all-time I am general time."
"1687950","1690210"," But those stocks turned out to be very inexpensive. "
"1691230","1693170"," Merck was very in his 14 times earnings."
"1693530","1699030"," So these are the companies that I really like because they do not trade at the multiples of"
"1699030","1700630"," enterprise software, which are insane."
"1701830","1707270"," Jim, interesting to see, you know, on a morning where the thinking was, oh, we got to rethink"
"1707270","1707630"," rates. "
"1708050","1709810"," Names like Pulte are up a percent or better."
"1710950","1717430"," Look, I think that you you posted a very good point on one of X from Dutch."
"1717690","1723510"," Yes, it's not a hot number, which means that housing will continue to be good. "
"1724010","1726250"," They're not building as many homes as they did before."
"1726490","1727510"," And then we'll all cost you down."
"1727670","1728630"," They're making a lot of money. "
"1729010","1730890"," Told brothers, I had like told best year."
"1731090","1732490"," Told brothers, part of using them out of stock."
"1733110","1737730"," I mean, this is not the whole, this is not your grandfather's home builders where they'd be putting"
"1737730","1741190"," them up like mad and they have no buyers or even the 2008 period. "
"1741650","1745190"," But I literally went out to the Imperial Valley to see if I shouldn't just buy a van and become"
"1745190","1747370"," a home builder, which of course I should have."
"1747470","1749410"," Instead, I watched my daughter play field hockey."
"1750470","1756890"," I was surprised Goldman put out a forecast for the mortgage rate, the 30 year fixed, ending the"
"1756890","1757790"," year still with a six. "
"1758230","1760790"," I mean, a low six, but it's not like that's going to collapse."
"1761210","1761950"," No, they're new."
"1762190","1766570"," Remember the mortgage rates are going to stay there and the price of housing is going to go down a"
"1766570","1766650"," little. "
"1766790","1767450"," Don't look at Manhattan."
"1768010","1769190"," That is a separate area."
"1769790","1774310"," You're going to be able to, I think you'll be able to do well because I think there's going to"
"1774310","1778910"," be a glut of apartments that roll starting at the same time. "
"1779330","1781430"," Now, I know I say, ignore Manhattan."
"1781810","1784830"," But anybody wants to see Venice, the Venice."
"1785150","1786290"," Oh, I'm sorry, the Guanas. "
"1787710","1792610"," The Guanas, the number of apartments that are being built on the Guanas, you would think it's the"
"1792610","1792910"," Riviera."
"1793090","1793350"," Really?"
"1793450","1793990"," You really would."
"1793990","1796310"," I mean, thousands of apartments have come in. "
"1796390","1797170"," They all start at the same time."
"1797550","1801970"," And I know that's anecdotal, but believe me, if they're building them around the Guanas, which by"
"1801970","1807810"," the way, sometimes is blue, sometimes is green, it's like the river and the movie, the fugitive,"
"1808210","1810010"," like St. Patrick's Day."
"1810210","1811450"," I mean, sometimes it's bubbling. "
"1811950","1815030"," I'm always afraid someone's going to be smoking a cigarette while I walk over the bridge."
"1815590","1821710"," Yeah, well, the new supply online is definitely a story in the Southeast state is most in that"
"1821710","1822030"," story."
"1822310","1826710"," People are not talking about the number of apartments that were started after COVID that are now"
"1826710","1827410"," coming on. "
"1827730","1832030"," They don't talk about it because a lot of them are these private developers, but there's going to"
"1832030","1833110"," be a glut of rent."
"1833490","1838850"," And therefore, there will not be that wonder of where you can stay in your rental or get a rental,"
"1838850","1839690"," to be very expensive."
"1840230","1841750"," That drives home prices down. "

"2799650","2801270"," which was down one tenth."
"2801570","2809870"," Now let's go to those ISM services the headline index 50.6 that is indeed a miss 50.6 we're"
"2809870","2816570"," looking for a number to be at 52.5 that was expected and 52.7 in the rear view mirror"
"2816570","2825410"," prices paid 57.4 pretty close expectations lower than 58.3 in the rear view mirror that's a good"
"2825410","2833450"," thing if we look at employment which we just had that report today of course 43.3 43.3 that"
"2833450","2840830"," is a big miss and of course that goes into contraction territory 43.3 way back machine weakest"
"2840830","2849950"," since July of 2020 and finally new orders expected to be around 56 is a miss but still an expansion"
"2849950","2857130"," territory at 52.8 so three of the four are in expansion we had some disappointments but the big"
"2857130","2862370"," disappointment seemed to have been December employment read we see that interest rates have backed"
"2862370","2871910"," off on those data points we move from basically 404 right down to what 398 now folks are under 4 "
"2871910","2878270","% and do keep in mind that we've seen big jumps on the week in terms of yield Sarah but"
"2878270","2883590"," of course as we dip below 4% we're going to take some of that back back to you and"
"2883590","2888910"," the equity market follows follows too likes that like the yields moving south thank you Rick Rick"
"2888910","2895030"," santelli with a miss there in services may be important for the market to see as we know that's"
"2895030","2898970"," been the hot part of the economy but if you add that onto the jobs report think we should talk"
"2898970","2902650"," about it there's a number there's a number of factors to highlight first of all overall headline"
"2902650","2909690"," was much better than expected more than 200,000 jobs added in the month of December 216,000 that"
"2909690","2915930"," was better it closes out what is what was an extraordinary year of job creation 2.7 million in"
"2915930","2920790"," total employment for 2023 I think that was better than most people expected the year to go the"
"2920790","2926410"," strength was somewhat offset by downward revisions that we got in the prior two months it left the"
"2926410","2933570"," level of payrolls in December only 145,000 above the previously reported level for November so it"
"2933570","2937370"," takes a little bit of shine off the number but it was still a good number think we should also"
"2937370","2942310"," talk about wages because that's what the market initially reacted to in terms of that spike in"
"2942310","2947270"," yields they came in a little bit hotter than expected of course good news for Americans maybe"
"2947270","2951970"," unsettling for the Fed which is trying to target wages and inflation average hourly earnings"
"2951970","2958090"," increasing 0.4 percent in the month so from the year from last year that's about 4.1 percent and"
"2958090","2962170"," it was a little bit of a step up from the 4 percent that we saw in November I think"
"2962170","2967530"," that the reaction Carl on the street from economists is this is not a number that's going to want"
"2967530","2975130"," to make the Fed cut rates anytime soon urgently it plays into the let's keep rates restrictive for"
"2975130","2981770"," longer to see make sure that we have some progress coming down in inflation which we have seen but"
"2981770","2986950"," a number like this makes you wonder if there's a risk that it sparks back up a little or stays"
"2986950","2992270"," high I don't yeah although household survey was so weak she got these negative revisions we just"
"2992270","2997250"," got ISM services employment nak timber also the journal looks at the three month average on private"
"2997250","3005390"," sector 115 in December that's the lowest since basically the economy reopened in 2020 october 44k"
"3005390","3009870"," given all the revisions yeah there've been a lot of downward revisions lately so it makes you"
"3009870","3013630"," wonder whether this one's going to be downwardly revised to also December's always kind of"
"3013630","3019750"," seasonally and holiday but you know we're also seeing real wage growth we're seeing wages grow"
"3019750","3024850"," above inflation something like a full point yeah and that's good that goes well for the consumer"
"3024850","3029570"," it's something that the Fed is definitely going to be paying attention to I think that on top of"
"3029570","3034350"," the did you see the European inflation numbers overnight Eurozone highly anticipated they were"
"3034350","3040490"," expected to tick up a little bit we did get that headline number goes up to 2.9 percent that"
"3040490","3046770"," was a little bit more than expected although on the plus side core was a little bit lower core was"
"3046770","3053070"," 2.4 percent sorry core was 2 3.4 percent and that was a"
"3053070","3062790"," little bit you know people are wondering if maybe it was too aggressive to price in"
"3062790","3068110"," 190 basis points of cuts for the ECB that's where we were last week now we're down to maybe 140"
"3068110","3073690"," basis points of cuts so it matters in that the market is trying to figure out how many cuts we're"
"3073690","3077290"," going to get next year and when those cuts are going to start but they're going to happen in March"
"3077290","3080490"," those odds are definitely decreasing for the Fed after the state."
"3080490","3085890"," I mean Europe's a complicated story Germany in particular where retail sales fell almost three"
"3085890","3091530"," times the estimate down to five the construction PMI there is under 40 for the fourth month in a"
"3091530","3096110"," row I mean Germany's got some issues which of course is not the only thing that's driving ECB"
"3096110","3100750"," policy no but the economy there is in worse shape no question about it then it is here which is"
"3100750","3106510"," why the market was more aggressive in terms of pricing the cuts for for the ECB but you know an"
"3106510","3111050"," energy prices go up then then the headline inflation numbers go up and that's something that the"
"3111050","3116650"," ECB has to pay attention to you know for every week number the how about the consumer the Costco"
"3116650","3122550"," numbers that were reported last night I saw a big jump in December both in same-store sales and in"
"3122550","3127990"," overall sales big jump over November and then the only other thing I would highlight is this sound"
"3127990","3132290"," bite from the Royal Caribbean CEO he was on with Brian Sullivan last night on last calls great"
"3132290","3137350"," interview and I know that cruises are having a moment but here's how he describes the consumer"
"3137350","3143030"," really stuck with me well I can tell you that the consumer is very healthy and when we actually"
"3143030","3147730"," when we pull our customers and we look at credit card data you know they're sitting on a lot of"
"3147730","3152330"," wealth a lot of savings and low credit card balances and so we're very encouraged by that but what"
"3152330","3159450"," we have seen is about a 30 percent increase versus 19 on onboard spend very bullish let's talk"
"3159450","3164070"," about the economy the jobs report coming in better than expected just to review us employers added"
"3164070","3169710"," 216,000 jobs in the month of December unemployment rate holds at 3.7 percent. "

"3226170","3233790"," that pre-pandemic benchmark of two percent over six month basis so that's a really very healthy"
"3233790","3239850"," economic picture and what adds to it is that wage growth ticked up for the month of December I"
"3239850","3245730"," mentioned the 4.1 percent from the 4 percent but does that make you a little bit nervous because we"
"3245730","3251090"," know the Fed has been trying to target inflation and wage growth certainly plays into that that"

"5020290","5025270"," but the other thing that the job reports showed today yon is that we're really seeing some real"
"5025270","5029790"," income growth some real wage growth which i know has been part of your soft landing scenario but"
"5029790","5035650"," now that wages are rising faster than inflation that bodes very well for consumption which also"
"5035650","5041990"," might make it harder for inflation to come down well we certainly agree that the economy is pretty"
"5041990","5047630"," solid and strong real income growth is an important part of that but it has not stood in the way"
"5047630","5054270"," of very significant disinflation in the united states and really across the world and we think"
"5054270","5058770"," that's going to continue to be the case will be additional disinflation and as there is"
"5058770","5065470"," disinflation in a healthy growth environment i think the feds likely to say you know five and three"
"5065470","5071430"," eights for the funds rate is too high that's the set signal that they have been sending what about"
"5071430","5075350"," financial conditions that's the other argument and we know they're watching it it was mentioned"
"5075350","5080590"," during the minutes of the last report does that threaten to keep inflation stickier than they'd"
"5080590","5086270"," like again i think it is a good reason to expect the economy to be solid from a growth perspective"
"5086270","5093030"," it's not necessarily going to have a big impact on disinflation yes at the margin you're right of"
"5093030","5098410"," course that all else equal easier financial conditions stronger real income growth a stronger"
"5098410","5104430"," economy means a little bit more inflation than you would see otherwise but i just don't think it's"
"5104430","5109650"," something that's large enough to overturn that do you think they are wary of cutting too close to"
"5109650","5115270"," the election but they want to get any cuts of the year done earlier rather than later no that's not"
"5115270","5121590"," really part of our thinking we we think you know they focused on the employment side and the"
"5121590","5126110"," inflation side of the mandate and that's how they make their decision what about conversations last"
"5126110","5133270"," couple of weeks about maybe slowing or ending QT right and thinking of treasury supply well they"
"5133270","5139110"," have been conversations about that for quite a while and certainly market participants for much of"
"5139110","5145950"," 2023 thought that QT was going to end much earlier than what they had signaled we don't really see"
"5145950","5151890"," it as imminent you know we're really thinking start sending signals late in the year and then ended"
"5151890","5157690"," you know very end of the year or early 2025 so you think they're going to cut in March and"
"5157690","5164030"," then how many times in 2023 five so we have cuts in March May and June and then two more"
"5164030","5170070"," quarterly cuts in Q3 and Q4 so you're more where the market is than where the Fed is in their"
"5170070","5175210"," projections and consensus i think well straight up yes but we also have a lower inflation forecast"
"5175210","5181670"," so the the feds forecast if you take the median projection in the summary of economic projections"
"5181670","5187670"," is 2.4 percent for core pc in the fourth quarter we're 2.2 percent and that's not a huge"
"5187670","5193850"," difference but when you're getting close to 2 percent it probably matters well your recent track"

"6470990","6478190"," million jobs over the course of 2023 more than the best year of the previous administration and"

"6531290","6536890"," this really should reduce it the odds of that that kind of thing can you bundle household survey"
"6536890","6545610"," negative revisions ism services employment temp jobs down into a more pernicious narrative uh you"
"6545610","6550910"," kind of you're inclined to i think if you take the average uh over the fourth quarter what you see"
"6550910","6556290"," is both job growth and wage growth in the fourth quarter was the slowest of the expansion but still"
"6556290","6561150"," pretty good uh as you mentioned there are some indicators that we'll probably see further slowing"
"6561770","6566270"," in job growth in the months ahead whether that actually turns into a negative number yet to be seen"
"6566270","6572650"," but i don't think that doesn't look like a prospect for january or february at least you're um"
"6572650","6577170"," you're counterpart over at Goldman Sachs Jan Hates was with us a few minutes ago and he sees a"

"6587870","6593290"," so restrictive why do you disagree so i do think they're in a position to eventually cut i don't"
"6593290","6598010"," think what we heard out of the minutes uh earlier this week suggests that that's something they"
"6598010","6603970"," have a plan for as soon as march uh i think given the wage number we saw today they probably"
"6603970","6609510"," want to be a little more comfortable that uh labor costs are moderating in a more significant way"
"6609510","6613890"," before i think they're comfortable to to declare victory which i think a cut is essentially"
"6613890","6618490"," declaring victory given their well-known reversal aversion i think they want to be pretty confident"
"6618490","6623090"," that when they start they're going to keep going what what is happening on the wage front because"
"6623090","6627990"," we got a little bit of a tick higher 4.1 percent now growth in in december we're seeing real"
"6627990","6635130"," wages really start to move up which is good for consumption where do you think that goes so as i"
"6635130","6639670"," mentioned at the outset if you look at the quarterly average you it's 3.7 percent annualized which"
"6639670","6645550"," is the softest uh since 2020 but it's still a good number and probably a little bit above uh what"
"6645550","6651910"," you would want to see to be comfortable that inflation is on a path to 2 percent so you know"
"6651910","6656630"," as as you mentioned this month we were a little higher than expected at four tenths uh there's a"
"6656630","6660950"," lot of revisions uh to these numbers that's why i kind of prefer to focus on the quarterly numbers"
"6660950","6667550"," and as i said those are moderating albeit still probably a little bit uh uh too hot for the fact"
"6667550","6674010"," just yet so when do you when do you what do you think the path of cuts looks like this"
"6674010","6679470"," year we have them starting in june uh and then uh cutting once per meeting every meeting thereafter"
"6679470","6684350"," for the remainder of the year i feel pretty pretty comfortable with that after this morning's"
"6684350","6691570"," number certainly it doesn't feel like as i said january or march looks uh looks particularly likely"
"6691570","6696250"," whether they could go in may you know that's a possibility but i think june feel pretty comfortable"
"6696250","6701110"," with that right now help us understand michael what's on the line for cpi next week and whether or"
"6701110","6707770"," not some of these uh international jitters are going to move uh sort of supply chain uh thinking in"
"6707770","6714930"," the weeks or months ahead yes we're probably looking for two or three next week i would say the uh"
"6714930","6718470"," one of the concerns here is that a lot of the improvement we have seen in the last six months"
"6718470","6725150"," which uh uh lael brandard mentioned has been due to softening and in goods prices and that a lot a"
"6725150","6730170"," lot of that reflects the improvements we've seen in supply chain performance if some of these"
"6730170","6736310"," international tensions cause disruptions in shipping and so forth we could see a reversal in that"
"6736310","6741390"," we haven't seen it uh just yet certainly in most of the measures we're looking at including uh some"
"6741390","6746610"," of the supply delivery numbers that we saw this week but it does remain a risk and and you know"
"6746610","6754090"," again one reason why we might not want to jump on or take a victory lap here on inflation just"
"6754090","6759450"," yet right although we've spent a fair amount of the morning talking about the the nice position for"
"6759450","6764770"," the moment that the u.s. consumers in given wages versus inflation and i imagine you you're"
"6764770","6771290"," probably i don't know to what degree is uh disposable income of focus for you right now so it looks"
"6771290","6775810"," good right so after this morning's uh number it looks like in the fourth quarter nominal incomes"
"6775810","6781370"," are growing nominal labor incomes growing around four and a half percent against two percent core"
"6781370","6786290"," inflation you know you have real income growing at around two and a half percent last quarter that"
"6786290","6791470"," should support pretty good consumer spending even without any movement in the saving rate so right"
"6791470","6796650"," now the picture on the consumer we think looks pretty good balance sheets look good we don't see a"
"6796650","6802850"," lot of problems uh broadly speaking in consumer credit so i think the picture for uh for the"
"6802850","6808170"," consumer looks you know pretty pretty well supported right now i know the consumer matters most but"
"6808170","6813570"," what about manufacturing which does continue to point to to weaker numbers transportation was a job"
"6813570","6820810"," loser this month yeah how how deep does that how do you does that pain go and can the overall"
"6820810","6825750"," economy withstand it yes so manufacturing has basically been going sideways for much of the past"
"6825750","6833510"," year surveys have looked terrible much worse than the actual production figures uh now let's if we"
"6833510","6839170"," do get the the rate cuts that people are anticipating i think that should help demand for durables"
"6839170","6843670"," things like autos which have been generally pretty depressed though had a good month last month"
"6843670","6849310"," should also help housing and housing when you see demand air pickup that should help uh the"
"6849310","6854230"," manufacturing sector more broadly and finally capital spending has been you know generally kind of"
"6854230","6859610"," lackluster given the high rate environment if that again moderates on here i think you actually do"
"6859610","6864990"," have a a path for a little bit better outcomes for manufacturing activity this year well at least"
"6864990","6870070"," the news flow is going to pick up next week including some bank earnings from some well-known banks"

"7019350","7024790"," point in the debate a really critical thing for them to get done only when they get the top line"

"7309420","7315480"," that's nothing to get too concerned about but since the beginning of this winter we've seen prices"

"7339040","7343820"," constructive on gas prices than on production side of things you know you're going to see activity"
"7343820","7349340"," levels respond to to these low prices and I think an anchor point for people to understand is we"
"7349340","7354380"," look at the marginal cost of production in the United States for natural gas requires around a 350"
"7354380","7361760"," price to hold production levels flat prices lower than that should lead prices to being which leads"
"7361760","7367060"," to lower activity cuts which should which should balance the supply demand fundamentals so so lower"

"7373020","7378200"," we've seen activity reductions but you know rate counts have dropped 20% over the last 12 months"

"8467810","8472610"," uh for people who may be thinking about college or on the fence about it not sure if they want"
"8472610","8476430"," to make that investment there are opportunities of course in the trades not only in construction"

"8481710","8487930"," shortage as well our cake appreciate that great logo on the hard hat as well that's uh this morning"
"8487930","8492830"," for a closer look at the december jobs number and the read through for markets in 2024 we're joined"
"8492830","8497910"," this morning at post nine by binky shot at chief u.s. equity and global strategist over at Deutsche"
"8497910","8503750"," Bank binky it's great to have you we got your 24 outlook uh a couple days ago roughly what 20"
"8503750","8509550"," times 250 or so that's correct that's the baseline view what um what do you think moves I know you"
"8509550","8515110"," would talk some materials here some financials as well yeah so I would argue the biggest theme"
"8515110","8521150"," remains as it has been the case for the last year uh the market's been very very focused on the"
"8521150","8527390"," weak spots and the possibility basically of the u.s. going into recession so you know in our view"
"8527390","8534030"," what you want to think about is what's priced in basically across sectors and industry groups for"
"8534030","8542270"," recession if a lot's already priced in then if it happens the risk reward is still positive and of"
"8542270","8548590"," course if it doesn't happen as it hasn't happened for what looks like six quarters now then at some"
"8548590","8554310"," point you're going to get a step function up and move up so I would say where most is priced"
"8554310","8562430"," in right now is really the cyclical parts of the u.s. consumer it's the the financials you"
"8562430","8567870"," mentioned materials that's the one place where we've made a change everything else we've sort of"
"8567870","8574670"," maintained for now uh and materials I would argue you know it's betting a little bit on some"
"8574670","8581490"," recovery and global growth and starting to nibble basically at the possibility that the long "
"8581490","8587790","-awaited dollar down cycle begins as and when global growth hangs in there or the perception of that"
"8587790","8593050"," changes you think that equities are still priced for recession even with the up that we saw say"
"8593050","8600570"," November december uh so I wouldn't say that they are priced for recession at uh you know trailing"
"8600570","8606730"," multiple well over 20 right now uh and and if you look back and see where we are relative to"
"8606730","8614650"," the peak uh in January the third 2022 say a long time ago you know we're very close to that"
"8614650","8619590"," yeah right so that's why I'm wondering why it's good to bet on cyclicals now if you don't think"
"8619590","8625050"," that recession uh so that's at the market level what I'm saying is that certain sectors and"
"8625050","8630910"," industry groups uh is where it is priced in and that's where you want to be long so materials that"
"8630910","8636790"," you think it's been too downbeat exactly exactly uh we're going to get some bank earnings starting"
"8637300","8643010"," in about a week that's some financials that are one and a half year high today is that starting to"
"8643010","8649490"," price in uh absolutely so that's been you know the trade that would be long that's what we've been"
"8649490","8654110"," recommending and it's been working yeah some of the calls we've gotten from other firms on banks"
"8654110","8659370"," this week suggest that we get an overshoot on multiples especially at the regional level the next"
"8659370","8665830"," few quarters uh I think that's very possible I think you know as you said the most important"
"8665830","8671210"," catalyst is really earnings which start next friday and I think the thing to keep in mind here on"
"8671210","8676790"," earnings is that if you look at the bottom up consensus for what uh it expects basically for"
"8676790","8685610"," earnings uh it would be one of the worst quarters of growth outside of a recession and if you you"
"8685610","8691830"," know juxtapose that against basically what's happening at the top down or macro level what you see"
"8691830","8699030"," is a the consensus still a little bit over 1% in terms of GDP growth uh the the direction"
"8699030","8706170"," of the consensus is getting basically you know is for upgrades and if you look at uh you know now"
"8706170","8711710"," cast indicators like the Atlantic Fed GDP you know it's at a solid two and a half percent so I"
"8711710","8716270"," would argue you know just like we've had for the last five quarters we're likely to have a sixth"
"8716270","8723090"," quarter of you know add or above trend growth but at the same time that might mean fewer rate cuts"
"8723090","8728370"," than the market is expecting and the market is seemingly focused more on that"
"8728370","8738310"," than the easy to talk about things that are going to happen in six months and 12"
"8738310","8742790"," months but there's a lot of water that flows under the bridge and I mean by that a lot of"
"8742790","8748610"," data a lot of time for people to change their minds I would argue if we continue to have at"
"8748610","8755270"," or slightly above trend growth I would be surprised to see more than a couple of what I would"
"8755270","8762950"," characterize as basically fine-tuning cuts I see the cuts if you know we get a very significant"
"8762950","8769370"," slowing in growth that's what we have in our house economics view but I would say you know that's"
"8769370","8773870"," been the consensus view and it's been the consensus view for quite a while you do raise the specter"
"8773870","8780790"," of the you call it the 1970s experience kind of coloring maybe some reticence to cut as much as the"
"8780790","8786790"," market hopes yeah I think the question is you know I think the pivot basically in December was a"
"8786790","8792070"," surprise I would say pretty much to everybody outside they have what I'm saying especially you know"
"8792070","8799070"," sort of a 180 degree turn in three months and so like I said you know three months is not"
"8799070","8802890"," such a long time and we are having a lot of discussions about what's going to happen in six months"
"8802890","8809690"," and 12 months it's the season to have those discussions so it's completely understandable but a lot"
"8809690","8816750"," of things could change by then and you know the call for rate cuts is predicated basically you know"
"8816750","8821430"," six and 12 months out on a view on what's going to happen to growth and I'm just simply pointing"
"8821430","8827870"," out that the consensus has had this strong almost unanimous view that growth is going to fall off"
"8827870","8834210"," and cliff so it makes logical sentence that they're calling for rate cuts but we shall see what"
"8834210","8839230"," happens to growth so it's a good roadmap for the least the next 12 months yeah thank you thanks"

"9085550","9091070"," has been the future of google search does its dominance continue in the generative AI age or will"
"9091070","9096290"," search be rebuilt from the ground up by up starts like perplexity which as you said just announced"

"9121410","9127970"," of Gmail still Google cast a long shadow guys as we well know it has left many challengers in its"
"9127970","9132370"," wake over the years there's smaller players like duck duck go which is pitching better privacy"

"9137790","9143310"," power of Chad GPT itself neither have made a dent in Google's 90 percent market share in search so"
"9143310","9149050"," I sat down with perplexity CEOs Arvind Srinivas earlier this morning and I asked him why this time"
"9149050","9157490"," is different search has been about pin blue links for the last like 20 years and 10 blue links was"
"9157490","9162870"," always a hack at the end of the day people just wanted an answer the concept of answer engine"
"9162870","9168170"," existed even in the late 90s and the internet was exploding asked to use was an answer engine in"
"9168170","9175370"," fact like many many Googlers used to like come from ask to use and join Google at that time because"
"9175370","9179510"," the 10 blue links was the concept that actually worked with the technology that existed at that"
"9179510","9186910"," time and so what perplexity does is a paradigm shift in search it's moving search from links to"
"9186910","9192670"," answers so even though Google is already working on this and it is rolling out a similar product in"
"9192670","9198770"," that existing search Srinivas says that it is still too cluttered perplexity he says is being built"
"9198770","9204770"," in this new AI era focusing on a core user experience that is clean minimal and simple sort of guys"
"9204770","9209470"," like how Google built search in the early stages of the internet and there is this sort of"
"9209470","9214450"," outstanding question here in Silicon Valley whether you need to build the next generation of AI"
"9214450","9220730"," apps in this era or whether sort of the legacy companies are going to build the next consumer"
"9220730","9228070"," facing apps here so is this one this is clearly one to watch Dear Joe what are the top the"
"9228070","9233790"," top AI startups that are going to rival some of the big players that we should be watching I will"
"9233790","9238470"," say though that this it's an interesting one because it's targeting search which has just been this"
"9238470","9243890"," big sort of existential question for Google over the last year but in terms of generative AI"
"9243890","9249030"," startups it's actually quite small valuation wise it's worth about half a billion dollars I realize"
"9249030","9253770"," that's a lot of money but you think about an open AI that you know potentially is reaching a"
"9253770","9260110"," valuation of a hundred billion dollars or anthropic twenty billion dollars plus you know on a"
"9260110","9265370"," million a million half of revenue per year so this one is actually relatively small but it is so"
"9265370","9271670"," interesting because the CEO has worked for Google has worked for open AI and you know I was talking"
"9271670","9275930"," to him about his start comes from Chennai India and he says that while he was working at Google he"
"9275930","9280750"," wanted to build a company but he didn't think that he was going to take on search and the idea"
"9280750","9285970"," that he thinks the moment is ripe to you know ultimately displace Google or do something that"
"9285970","9290310"," Google is doing right now is such an interesting one and so relevant for Wall Street that is why"
"9290310","9296290"," Google has sort of been under pressure somewhat over the last year I mean it's still stock price"
"9296290","9300730"," has gone up because it is building the foundational technology but there's still this question how"
"9300730","9306290"," does search surviving in what form yeah keep for Google investors no doubt thank you very much dear"

"9560210","9568010"," some big revenue misses and warnings so the consumer has been remarkably resilient as we look at"
"9568010","9573390"," the the state of the consumer today the I don't have December data yet around our category growth"

"9577450","9587270"," October November period the growth rate of our has"

"9592910","9598290"," United States with about roughly half of our businesses done outside the United States we're seeing"
"9598290","9603650"," that trend continue as well with particular strength in Asia and Latin America it's not being"
"9603650","9610230"," reflected in the stocks Rod clearly something something is was worrying staples investors whether"
"9610230","9615630"," it's you know the dividends aren't as attractive with high rates or the idea that price increases"
"9615630","9621710"," have just been too high and now we're seeing volume declines are those concerns over blown yeah I"
"9621710","9626410"," tend to think the concerns the latter Sarah and you're right consumer staples as a lag we we've lab"
"9626410","9632490"," versus other industries and so when you look at what's in there I do think there's some concern"
"9632490","9638950"," around where companies can price from here and unit volumes have been down and revenue increases"
"9638950","9645190"," have largely been behind the the pricing gains that have occurred I do think we're in an"
"9645190","9649150"," environment now where we're not going to be able to price at the same level as we have in the"
"9649150","9655050"," past we don't plan on that basis last year we grew 4% organic roughly half of that was priced"
"9655050","9660890"," half of it was unit volume in the fiscal year we're in now we expect to grow in that same"
"9660890","9668290"," range with both unit volume growth and some price growth again less less price increase but good"
"9668290","9674670"," revenue management work around mix promotion intensity promotion efficiency can still drive revenue"
"9674670","9679910"," gains for us above unit volume and that's what we're focused on although we're seeing some examples"
"9679910","9686350"," this week in packaged food for example where you had both volume and price flip negative and I"
"9686350","9692050"," wondered do you think that becomes the norm across staples I don't think so again if the consumer"
"9692050","9699210"," changes you know that dynamic changes but as we look at it again as I said our recent period the"
"9699210","9706350"," growth rates in our categories so shave grooming sun care skincare feminine care the category"
"9706350","9712310"," growth rates are there now will they slow maybe we're prepared for that if they do but but I would"
"9712310","9718810"," expect that what we've seen will will continue to see which is category growth rates some some care"
"9718810","9724010"," growing double digits for example shave growing low single digits but every category we operate in"
"9724010","9729990"," is growing both here domestically in the US and globally as well and just on pricing if you could"
"9729990","9736370"," just distill it a little further rod are we talking about back to 2019 levels are we talking about"
"9736370","9744270"," deflationary pricing yeah there's no pricing coming out we're not reducing price per se anywhere"
"9744270","9750230"," but for example in the United States we don't anticipate taking any meaningful less price increases"
"9750230","9755530"," this year everything that we have taken has been sold in it's in through retailers they've accepted"
"9755530","9762110"," it and it's there we do have some incremental pricing still happening outside the United States"
"9762110","9767190"," primarily in some Asian markets and Latin American markets as well so there is still some pricing"
"9767190","9772590"," power there and I think we're in a period where it looks like it used to look pre-pandemic where"
"9772590","9778250"," if you have great innovation product benefit and experience something that gives incremental"
"9778250","9783370"," benefit to consumers they're willing to pay for it and you can price for it but you have to have"
"9783370","9788090"," the innovation you have to have the improved product and experience behind it all right well"
"9788090","9793190"," certainly appreciate it with the update on on all the big things we're watching inflation consumer"
"9793190","9799150"," spending volumes rod little of agile with an update i do think Carl for whatever it's worth the the"
"9799150","9804890"," concerns are greater in packaged food than in household products and staples that that rod makes as"
"9804890","9810090"," far as the pricing growth and the volume declines like we saw at ConAgra this week for sure"
"9810090","9814450"," interesting yeah then the innovation conversation is really fascinating and not not the end of that"
"9814450","9821630"," discussion as well as for next week it's going to get really busy between CPI Thursday PPI Friday"

"9837310","9843790"," honest on that stuff meantime we are holding 4700 4705 in the wake of the jobs number today which"
"9843790","9848170"," of course has some pretty interesting internals when you mix in some of the ISM have a good week"

"9854630","9858790"," Wopner front and center this hour life after the streak as stocks pace to break that remarkable"
"9858790","9863370"," nine-week run now the investment committee debates where the markets are likely to go from here"
"9863370","9867970"," most importantly how you should play that joining me for the hour today Jenny Harrington Jason"
"9867970","9873370"," Snipe, Jim Layton, Paul Steve Weiss everybody in the house here at post nine let's go to the"
"9873370","9878830"," markets we still are green across the board but as you see we are not nearly as strong as we"
"9878830","9884450"," were hour hour and a half ago or so Jimmy I'll turn to you first so we're going to end"
"9884450","9889310"," this nine-week winning streak it's a Nasdaq's worst week since September he got the strong jobs"
"9889310","9895470"," report wages were slightly above and then the ISM services were squirrely week barely hanging on to"
"9895470","9901090"," 50 what do we do with this week what do we learn this week first thing and answer the question"
"9901090","9905730"," about you know the eight-week streak nine-week streak coming to an end good good all right because"
"9905730","9910070"," we needed to come to an end right what are we going to keep going 10 11 etc no this"
"9910070","9915530"," is the pause that refreshes and my take on this week everybody is that this is noise this week the"
"9915530","9921890"," downturn the first three days the upturn today it's noise in what's going to be a very noisy year I"
"9921890","9926510"," think it's going to be a very positive year and I can't stress this point highly enough the tone"
"9926510","9932030"," has changed from the last two years of how high is the Fed going to hike rates to now we're"
"9932030","9935770"," not talking about rate hikes and I don't care I'm looking at you Scott not that you're coming at me"
"9935770","9938990"," but I'm just looking at you because I want to have a focal point well I'm a focal point you're"
"9938990","9945390"," okay I don't care just show it I don't care how long it takes them to cut I don't care"
"9945390","9950310"," how many times they cut that's irrelevant the fact is we're no longer talking about rate hikes why"
"9950310","9955430"," does this matter it means that good news is good news it means 200,000 jobs being created is good"
"9955430","9960550"," news it means that now listen I'm not all that happy with a 4.1% wage growth year over"
"9960550","9965170"," year but it's not going to provoke the Fed to start raising rates again and absent that it means"
"9965170","9970390"," it's good for consumption which is good for the economy look I don't like I don't like the ISM"
"9970390","9975150"," number and I don't like the way that labor force participation went down but there's noise in every"
"9975150","9980090"," data series I think we've got to strip out the signal from the noise and right now the signal is"
"9980090","9985410"," inflation is coming down the economy is strong profits are growing and this should be a good year"
"9985410","9992570"," in the markets all right so Jenny my distillation from all of that is that Jim says the story's"
"9992570","9998010"," intact right he gave you all the reasons why he thinks it is but that's what I take away from"
"9998010","10003810"," what he said the soft landing inflation down economy good stock market good stories intact after"
"10003810","10010370"," this week I agree I agree and so well the story's intact it doesn't mean necessarily that we have"
"10010370","10013830"," the right right now to go to new highs and I don't think we do I think when Jim said"
"10013830","10019630"," you know hey we're backing off a little bit good I agree good it was too much too fast and"
"10019630","10024850"," so what I know we'll get to later is we've taken some money off the table and usually when I"
"10024850","10028730"," take money off the table it's paired with the immediate buy right but right now I don't think"
"10028730","10034010"," things need to pair and so everything's not moving in tandem the market got kind of frothy into"
"10034010","10037810"," year end the story is intact for this year I feel good about this year I know within a month"
"10037810","10041610"," or so I'll be back to fully invested but right now I'm sitting on a little cache and I think"
"10041610","10047050"," that's I think that's okay when I'm thinking about the story being intact too I think the story"
"10047050","10050810"," gets better and better as the year goes on because we have all these nasty things that are going to"
"10050810","10053890"," be out of the way we're going to know if it's six rate cuts which I don't think it is"
"10053890","10057630"," or three or two or none we're going to know for sure we're going to be done with the presidential"
"10057630","10062650"," election we're going to have way more clarity on if inflation stays like a little sticky or if it's"
"10062650","10068250"," done but this is a year where really like clarity comes in a way that we haven't experienced for"
"10068250","10075650"," the past four and so I'm actually feeling not good in a raw markets going to new highs way but"
"10075650","10080930"," I'm feeling as good as I've felt in at least four years because as an investor I can make decisions"
"10080930","10085790"," and invest and think about investments and think about forward cash flows in a functional way"
"10085790","10090250"," without distortions and disruptions in a way that I haven't been able to before so to me the"
"10090250","10094590"," investment picture is intact so Jason I'm watching yields and you know the market is clearly"
"10094590","10099510"," tracking where yields are going right and reacting is such I mean the equity market because if you"
"10099510","10106830"," have the 10 year you know you get the jobs report and rates move up a little bit and cut"
"10106830","10114590"," expectations go down a little bit then the ISM report comes out and rate cut expectations go back"
"10114590","10120410"," up interest rates the 10 year yield comes down but I'm watching the 10 year right at 4% and"
"10120410","10128390"," equity market is clearly a little uneasy about where yields are ahead of the CPI next week Fed"
"10128390","10132770"," meeting is not for several weeks till the end of the month but we have earnings too what's your"
"10132770","10136670"," great takeaway and outlook for this year because we haven't heard from you by the way happy new"
"10136670","10142370"," year to be back yeah no so what I would say is the biggest thing I paid attention this week"
"10142370","10149350"," was the Fed minutes right so what was evident and very clear to me was hey look we are pricing"
"10149350","10154730"," out a March cut that's really what's going on the market and I think there's a fair amount of"
"10154730","10160970"," digestion as well listen we ran a lot over the last nine weeks and to Jimmy's point you know it"
"10160970","10165930"," is time for a little bit of digestion going forward there are a lot of variables that will affect"
"10165930","10170850"," the market we have earnings that are starting in earnest next Friday this time next Friday which I"
"10170850","10174110"," think is going to be great by the way I'm going to let you finish your comment too if we"
"10174110","10179470"," have rate cut expectations if we guys can in the control room please can we show that it'll it'll"
"10179470","10186610"," show you if if the Fed was trying to get the market to price out a March rate cut today's"
"10186610","10192370"," economic data didn't do the job because as I said you know jobs report comes in stronger wages come"
"10192370","10197050"," in a little bit stronger rate cut expectations actually go down a little bit but then ISM comes in"
"10197050","10201690"," week and then you're going to see when we show it what happened next because you were I don't know"
"10201690","10206250"," hour and a half ago you're like 70 plus percent for a March cut so anyway we'll show that I"
"10206250","10209650"," want you to look at that and I'm sorry to interrupt you but no please carry on I think it's"
"10209650","10215850"," an important point but let's also pay attention to the dot plot dot plot I mean Jay Powell Jerome"
"10215850","10221230"," Powell has talked about three cuts he did not talk about six cuts the market's been pricing in six"
"10221230","10225670"," cuts I mean for a lot of us on this desk I'm sure this seems a little bit out of"
"10225670","10232210"," this world right so the idea that we're also pricing out a March cut you know and kind of letting"
"10232210","10237390"," the market let's let market play out let's see what earnings do in earnest we'll see what"
"10237390","10243050"," financials do we're going to focus on credit call credit quality we'll focus as well on provisions"
"10243050","10247250"," I think that's going to be a big deal they were loaded up for financials last quarter right so"
"10247250","10253010"," let's let's see what that looks like and I think let's ultimately let earnings play out okay I'm"
"10253010","10255950"," going to come back to you in a minute because you have some moves that we need to go through"
"10255950","10259590"," and Jenny does as well well why so I want to hear from you because I'd like your take on"
"10259590","10263850"," the same question I asked at the very top as to what your takeaway is from this week if you"
"10263850","10271130"," feel as Jim does that the story and Jenny as well that the story is still intact despite everything"
"10271130","10277390"," that that happened this week with the way the market you know sort of came to grips with with where"
"10277390","10283630"," we think Fed policy is going to be again dows now negative S&P is leaking a little bit we're"
"10283630","10290030"," still hanging on to 4700 but what you take so my take is that the headlines are still accurate"
"10290030","10297510"," there will be the Fed will cut but I had said on Monday show before the moves came out they're"
"10297510","10303070"," not cutting six times they will do three times may do four they're not cutting this quarter they"
"10303070","10308570"," may not cut next quarter it'll be the back half of the year because while inflation is coming down"
"10308570","10315030"," it's still stubbornly high this moves inflation and not what we saw from the real extreme levels"
"10315030","10321290"," number one number two I don't believe that recession is out of the question yet I just don't well"
"10321290","10327970"," the ISM services number that comes out today you know 50.6 I think it was makes you wonder what's"
"10327970","10332850"," going to happen to that part of the economy which run manufacturing has been weak right services"
"10332850","10340790"," has not right now you can't you can't afford to to start losing that right and I do think you"
"10340790","10347010"," will start I do think it will start declining it's been usually strong for an usually long time let"
"10347010","10351910"," me just this is what I was talking about earlier right you see pre jobs report you're 65 percent"
"10351910","10356590"," odds of a march cut right then jobs report comes out what's a little bit stronger so it goes down"
"10356590","10363530"," to 57 ISM services which we're talking about as we speak comes out barely hanging on to 50 and then"
"10363530","10367710"," you go back up to 73 percent for going to have to see how this all plays out but nonetheless"
"10367710","10374230"," so to get to 70 percent to to achieve those odds to achieve a cutting in march I think you"
"10374230","10378910"," need to see more weakness much more weakness in the economy because weakness at this point in the"
"10378910","10384330"," economy is really the only thing that's going to get inflation down so because you're stubbornly"
"10384330","10388350"," you're not far above the Fed's target that's not necessarily true I mean you're going to find out"
"10388350","10393850"," with the CPI next week if we continue on trend right to come lower I think we will but again"
"10393850","10400150"," it's going to be baby steps going forward it's not going to a leaps and bounds wage growth is still"
"10400150","10405310"," there now the jobs number was not particularly strong if you go through the details health care"
"10405310","10412270"," hiring was strong and it should be strong because we've got such a void in the in health care that"
"10412270","10417230"," you're going to see a lot more hiring it's going to keep going and going so overall look to me"
"10417230","10422970"," the market we're still going to see tech lead because there recession resistant forgetting about"
"10422970","10428590"," the ad spending etc and that's where I like put my money so I'll be looking to rebuild those"
"10428590","10434290"," positions I still have core positions there but not the size they work as I sold before the end of"
"10434290","10440310"," the year I still think that's the place to be because I don't have as much economic sensitivity so"
"10440310","10444850"," some the other Jenny you've said that you agreed with Jim that the story is still intact after this"
"10444850","10449370"," week but I look at some moves that you made and I see what feels to me like a little"
"10449370","10454750"," bit of nervousness about where we're at look at stocks that have gone up a bunch ones that you own"
"10454750","10461970"," and now you're tripping uber for the third time right you've sold iron mountain you sold seagate"
"10461970","10468410"," tell me about these moves don't forget united rentals iron mountain seagate uber as you said so you"
"10468410","10473670"," tripped united rentals right and this is not not a macro call this is literally like portfolio"
"10473670","10478090"," management 101 you look at your portfolio you look at the positions and you say what's the"
"10478090","10482530"," opportunity cost of continuing to hold this how much more upside is there from here so united"
"10482530","10489150"," rentals for example we first added in 2017 at 77 it's up 600 historically has traded 10 times now"
"10489150","10493270"," it's at 13 times so we take it down from the 5ish percent position that it grew to down to"
"10493270","10498090"," 3 percent ditto for uber on uber it's a little like more of a fun story we can get back"
"10498090","10502610"," to that debate that we had with brad gersner where you know where he's saying look there's way way"
"10502610","10507750"," more long-term potential there i think he's not the only one right there many on this show who own"
"10507750","10513610"," it and say now's not the time to get out that this thing may be just getting started but then"
"10513610","10518030"," there's also analysts throughout they're like you know putting 62 dollar price targets on it 66"
"10518030","10522630"," dollar price targets on it as a as a portfolio manager you need to say to yourself if i only"
"10522630","10527150"," have 10 percent more upside in this am i doing the right thing by my clients continuing continuing"
"10527150","10531650"," to hold that if i think in short order i can buy something else that over the next year or"
"10531650","10536770"," two years has 20 30 40 50 upside now let's go to iron mountain and seagate where those are full"
"10536770","10543070"," exits seagate we bought a year and a quarter ago at 56 bucks seagate is really interesting because"
"10543070","10548530"," when i bought it like everybody hated memory this is my third time owning seagate and making a"
"10548530","10553050"," decent return on it you buy memory when everybody hates it you sell memory when everybody's"
"10553050","10558050"," positive on it so the stock goes from 56 to 80 a 5 percent yield 10 under 4 percent yield"
"10558050","10563430"," you take your money you get out there's limited upside from here the valuations right the yields"
"10563430","10568390"," down to under 4 percent i am quite certain that within the next month i'll have something in the"
"10568390","10572150"," portfolio that replaces it with a five and a half percent or better dividend yield because you know"
"10572150","10577430"," the objective is in this portfolio right the equity income one not the one that has um the uber and"
"10577430","10581290"," the united rentals but in the dividend one it's maintaining this 5 percent yield or better so you"
"10581290","10587470"," need to recycle iron mountain i actually bought in 2015 and that's how to it kind of languished for"
"10587470","10591490"," a long time had a really juicy dividend yield so i could sit with it but iron mountain which you"
"10591490","10596790"," all know from the data from sorry the document storage right just like to send your boxes of legal"
"10596790","10600910"," documents they put them in their warehouses they also very quietly and this was always the"
"10600910","10604870"," investment thesis in the background been building up these data warehouse centers well this year"
"10604870","10610310"," when data warehouse became extra hot again this share price was up um who was it up it was up"
"10610310","10615630"," over 40 percent this year and now i've got a real estate investment trust with an under 4 percent"
"10615630","10620430"," dividend yield in the portfolio and don't forget that's not qualify dividend income so even though"
"10620430","10625310"," it's under 4 percent it's really worse on an after-tax basis same thing here maybe there's upside"
"10625310","10629930"," in iron mountain i'm not saying either of these are bad but they don't fit the strategy and i think"
"10629930","10635570"," my upside even just from sitting in cash for or the next month is probably better on both of these"
"10635570","10639430"," i've got a nice short list of potentials i don't know which all of them but they're things like EPS"
"10639430","10644430"," which i've talked about like Wendy's like forward key bank which i mentioned last week i don't know"
"10644430","10648830"," which of those will make it in maybe it'll be something different but when i buy those i will think"
"10648830","10652510"," to myself there's more upside in that new investment than there was sitting in these all right then"
"10652510","10656630"," you'll tell us if you make a move there of course Jason you trimmed service now i did it was"
"10656630","10663270"," a huge winner and i know how much you like Bill McDermott um why trim that now yeah so i"
"10663270","10669810"," mean for me listen the stock was up 82 by year had a very difficult 2022 but what i what"
"10669810","10676290"," i know is software enterprise software spend is slowing right um we have to reposition this name"
"10676290","10682650"," again i i love the story it services they do great work streamlining workflows um and and the"
"10682650","10687810"," integration i think they're the long-term story is a lot more growth going forward but again when"
"10687810","10692850"," the stock has moved 80 plus percent in a year it's time to return it and and look elsewhere for"
"10692850","10697130"," other opportunities so jimmy i'll look at this is a pretty interesting stat we got from the flow"
"10697130","10704070"," show out of bank of america today highest cash inflow ever for a first week of the year highest"
"10704070","10711590"," ever for the first week of year i contributed in in in what has been a rocky week now we'll"
"10711590","10715750"," get more specific in a moment what do you make of that fomo i mean don't you think it's just"
"10715750","10723970"," fear of missing out um what i thought there was cash at the cash inflow cash inflow cash raised"
"10723970","10728990"," cash inflow yeah yeah cash inflow you were than the other side of that trade so let's just make"
"10728990","10735330"," sure we're talking about inflows inflows inflows yes okay so look i mean people the tone has"
"10735330","10740590"," changed i'm sorry to repeat myself but the tone has changed from the last 22 months the last 22"
"10740590","10746130"," months has been how high is the fed going how badly will the economy react how badly will profits"
"10746130","10751250"," drop that we're not talking about that anymore um we're talking about when will cuts occur how many"
"10751250","10755130"," of them will occur and certainly there's a great debate about it by the way steve totally agree six"
"10755130","10760690"," cuts is ridiculous okay but the tone is completely changed right now where people are rotating to"
"10760690","10765150"," be back on the balls of their feet in terms of investing instead of rotating to their heels and"
"10765150","10769230"," saying okay i'm comfortable in cash who have cash still yields whatever yields five and a quarter"
"10769230","10774410"," percent but people recognize just look at the last two months in the stock market that you can make"
"10774410","10779590"," twice that in two months and so i think it's as simple as saying fomo fear of missing out and"
"10779590","10784450"," you know what it's right there is something to be missed out on you yeah i mean and it's all"
"10784450","10789150"," going to come down i guess white star earnings right um next Friday with the banks really kicks"
"10789150","10796290"," things off Wells Wells Fargo's Chris Harvey is talking about a reverse hat trick and he's talking"
"10796290","10802270"," about the introduction of underwhelming guidance to start earnings is likely to remain a near term"
"10802270","10806470"," net negative catalyst we're just talking about all the cattle Jimmy gave you a list of all the"
"10806470","10813730"," catalysts to keep this thing going and why he's so positive are we taking into consideration what"
"10813730","10819210"," might happen with earnings season i don't think we are i think purely what we saw this this past"
"10819210","10825290"," week has been people that have been looking to sell for months and just said i'm gonna ride it"
"10825290","10830250"," number one and then i'm going to delay paying taxes on my gains so i'll wait to the first week"
"10830250","10836570"," in January which is why i saw the last day of 2023 and and that's what we've seen happen so"
"10836570","10842290"," i don't think you've seen any displacement in the optimism and people are not focused on earnings"
"10842290","10847290"," all uh as a matter of fact when you hear a lot of the strategies talk aside from what you"
"10847290","10853350"," just mentioned earnings are an afterthought it's the Fed cutting it's that the economy strong et"
"10853350","10859850"," cetera and my view is that the economy is not that strong services sure but otherwise no we've been"
"10859850","10864790"," in a manufacturing recession for a long period of time i don't see that changing accepting"
"10864790","10869890"," industries that are going to be funded by the largest of federal governments okay they'll keep"
"10869890","10875250"," going so so what i'd say is that earnings i think they'll be fine they'll meet guidance they always"
"10875250","10882050"," do you know even in bad times 75 percent of the companies do better but i do think the guidance"
"10882050","10886430"," will take you hit this isn't the quarter where that's going to happen though we're the big guy over"
"10886430","10890550"," here it's going to be second quarter i know is waiting to disagree with you well i it but on"
"10890550","10895590"," a somewhat minor point i think people are focused on earnings at least i am okay and i think"
"10895590","10901210"," anybody who's running a portfolio professionals that's fine anybody who's running a portfolio is"
"10901210","10906250"," saying earnings better come through i mean seriously if they don't then you're right all right and"
"10906250","10910690"," i'll come on the air and say that to you earnings have to come through we're projecting you for"
"10910690","10917110"," more than air i'm sure you will you're projecting 11 12 percent the analyst community is s&p 500 or"
"10917110","10923250"," two optimistic yes he says yes here's why i think it comes through all right let's just put this"
"10923250","10929390"," together three components one GDP real GDP is growing okay that helps the top line and that is"
"10929390","10934790"," cemented by a consumer that's strong i mean those 200,000 jobs today that matters for consumption"
"10934790","10939950"," okay the final thing and this is where i think people are missing things margins will improve why"
"10939950","10946750"," because the ppi this is subtle folks but important ppi has been much much lower than cpi and that"
"10946750","10952090"," is the cost of raw goods cpi is finished goods basically that's where margins improve is that"
"10952090","10957570"," differential between ppi and cpi jenny so here here's what i think about earnings everyone i know"
"10957570","10961550"," is super focused on them and i think it's going to be an interesting season to watch because i"
"10961550","10966390"," suspect that earnings do come in i actually think mathematically we can get to that 11 percent and"
"10966390","10971310"," what's going to be interesting is in q1 i expect we see things like we saw at nike and fedex"
"10971310","10976270"," where they make the earnings but what's behind it was ugly right like headcount catbacks reduction"

"10981170","10985430"," the beginning of the year and and revenues were good in that supported earnings but what i think"
"10985430","10989170"," could be really interesting and support not just the consumer but corporations which we're not"
"10989170","10994590"," really talking about too much is as interest rates come down as energy prices have come down and"

"11006290","11012070"," wind at the back of earnings and get us to that 11 total growth on the year i don't think"
"11012070","11017010"," i don't think that's that spectacular i think it's a mathematical equation that plays out i think"
"11017010","11022210"," one of the things we need to focus on with your and my enthusiasm right is actually where to be"
"11022210","11026450"," invested next year and again i really don't want to be at the broad macro level so when you see"
"11026450","11030230"," so when you see me actually having a spring in my step for the first time in a long time"
"11030230","11035370"," i'm enthusiastic because of the have-nots and where i want to focus next year are the companies"
"11035370","11040010"," that don't need three rate cuts to get there right the companies that don't need to pull levers to"
"11040010","11044470"," get there and i think there's a lot of those out there when we take out that narrow sliver that"
"11044470","11049810"," performed last year valuations are fine earnings growth is fine fine i think there's a lot there"
"11049810","11053930"," was the cups are easy for the first two quarters you had negative earnings for the first two"
"11053930","11060810"," quarters in 2023 so they should recover somewhat but here's what keeps gnawing at me is that you"
"11060810","11066890"," can't go through that massive tightening cycle without it really severely impacting the company you"
"11066890","11073270"," can do country you can delay it but you can't avoid it completely so last year was driven by"
"11073270","11079730"," multiple expansion this has to be the year of earnings expansion to support that multiple expansion"
"11079730","11084890"," otherwise that's where you could run in trouble and that's my concern i'm not bearish i'm going to"
"11084890","11088830"," play the names i'm playing i do have a lot of cash right now and i'm looking to play but"
"11088830","11093670"," the names that i think can withstand declining economy the other question i have Jason is whether"
"11093670","11098910"," the market suddenly has an apple problem because it's the worst mega cap of the week right it's the"
"11098910","11103650"," biggest stock in the market right great trillion in market cap it's down five percent as i said"
"11103650","11110630"," worst market cap it's made up nearly 20 percent of the Nasdaq 100s losses this week alone yep"
"11110630","11115530"," you've got a couple downgrades this week which you don't often see maybe you see one here and there"
"11115530","11121490"," you rarely see two in the same week yeah um we ask this question all the time as goes apple"
"11121490","11127190"," so goes the market question mark right so i think with apple as a potential apple it's always a"
"11127190","11132970"," narrative shift i think to your point the largest largest largest company in the world um you know"
"11132970","11141110"," revenue revenue growth has been declining right um you have a multiple of 30 times uh forward um"
"11141110","11146070"," you know with a long-term growth rate of almost 10 percent i mean this is a this is a"
"11146070","11151690"," spread that's troublesome for a lot of folks and i think all the time when there is volatility in"
"11151690","11154730"," the market that's when we start to talk about the multiple right so the multiples of problem"
"11154730","11158870"," anytime we start to see some volatility well i mean when the stock goes up you know near 50 percent"
"11158870","11165610"," last year right when you could make a credible case that the fundamentals of the current periods"
"11165610","11170430"," didn't justify a 50 percent move by in other words if i told you the beginning of the year you"
"11170430","11174290"," know what apple's gonna have three consecutive quarters of negative revenue growth but the stock's"
"11174290","11179290"," gonna be up 50 percent you said you're crazy 100 based on what 100 percent and i and i think"
"11179290","11185830"," last year and going into last year um apple was a defensive play yeah right so the iPhones are"
"11185830","11190830"," going to be weaker and smartphones are going to be weak 100 percent and now this year again we're"
"11190830","11195530"," only in the fourth trading day of the year so let's not cast this big story on what 2020 4"
"11195530","11199690"," is going to be all about for apple but now it's a source of funds right it's down five plus"
"11199690","11203610"," percent in the first week um but again when you look at the multiple you look at the long-term"
"11203610","11207990"," revenue you look at the revenue growth and you look at the long-term rotary yes of course it plays"
"11207990","11212550"," right into what's what's happening i mean jimmy now fox con guidance overnight yeah is that another"
"11212550","11218090"," warning sign for the biggest stock in the market we need to to pay attention to yes i mean if"
"11218090","11223470"," we give a quick answer but yes you do but apple doesn't matter to the overall market as much as"
"11223470","11228030"," it used to it doesn't matter i hear that from from you know when i raise the question that's the"
"11228030","11233450"," comeback for many is that in fact true um that's that's where i am so i mean first just the"
"11233450","11238450"," math right stocks down nine percent from a threes and high more or less s&p 500 is down two"
"11238450","11242930"," percent from a threes and high now the s&p is down as apples down i'll give that correlation but"
"11242930","11247390"," it's not down to the same degree and and look the simple math we know this if the mega seven"
"11247390","11253170"," the magnificent seven or 28 percent of the s&p 500 that means there's 72 percent that's not those"
"11253170","11257150"," names and i think actually you're not only seeing it in the last week but you're seeing it over the"
"11257150","11261390"," last two and a half weeks that there can be a catch-up trade now it certainly doesn't help you"
"11261390","11266010"," don't want apple going down another 10 percent but folks it could happen and i said this yesterday"
"11266010","11269230"," i'm going to say it again when you get the sort of return scott that you were just saying what"
"11269230","11274750"," 48 percent last year for apple or let alone the 200 percent for invideo last year you have to"
"11274750","11279630"," accept the volatility that comes with it there is no free lunch and i know we're talking about"
"11279630","11284390"," apple but i think the comment i'm making is more writ large within video last year july it goes to"
"11284390","11289750"," 500 promptly sells off 20 percent two zero percent down to 400 people are saying oh my god we're"
"11289750","11293230"," going to fill that gap then it pops up i'm not going to talk about the gap it pops up"
"11293230","11298750"," 25 percent to 500 comes back to 450 if you want to play this game of those sort of multi"
"11298750","11304670"," double digit returns or triple digit returns you have to pay for it in volatility my advice to"
"11304670","11309950"," people in this regard is not to go say apple's broken or or sell these magnificent seven but as"
"11309950","11313530"," jenny would say because you said it earlier it's about portfolio management it's about risk"
"11313530","11318190"," management choose your sizing i'm underweight in apple because i do think there's a little bit more"
"11318190","11323030"," downside if it goes down 10 percent i'll probably add to it from i'm watching microsoft wise too"
"11323030","11329470"," because it's you know 2.2 and three quarter billion dollars so it's near three trillion in uh in"
"11329470","11335570"," market cap yeah look those are great headlines great things to talk about but what i see with"
"11335570","11342650"," microsoft is a is a permanent compounder i love permanent compounders number one number two ai is"
"11342650","11346510"," going to be huge for them it's going to allow them to increase pricing which by the way they've"
"11346510","11351990"," done on a couple of fights already it's going to require new subscriptions to get full access to"
"11351990","11359650"," their ai toolbox so to me it's uh it's the premier uh ai play out there trillion i might say"
"11359650","11367130"," obviously yeah um so it's um so why not so is the multiple little stretches point yes do i see"
"11367130","11372930"," this the earnings going into that multiple near term absolutely and by the way i'm not going to"
"11372930","11376830"," trade around this the games are too big and i'm too much a believer and where would i put my"
"11376830","11382150"," money in what's the next best microsoft well for me that's meta so those are two my largest"
"11382150","11388690"," positions and i think that is again the permanent compounders not they permanently go up every day"
"11388690","11393770"," but over a long over any time frame you're going to see the stocks higher but that's not"
"11393770","11398390"," necessarily true and i i keep dragging this between microsoft okay but not really you can look at"
"11398390","11405430"," microsoft from i think it was 2001 until 2013 the stock was totally flat and it had that huge run"
"11405430","11410030"," going into that so so what i know why right yes but what i struggle with now and i mean"
"11410030","11414730"," it's like literally as a question not as uh as picking a fight what is the realistic return"
"11414730","11421930"," potential of microsoft next year and the year after that you know to me uh i would expect me to"
"11421930","11427170"," do at least as well as the market at least as well okay i don't expect a hundred percent move"
"11427170","11432710"," again from the bottom like we had but you know it's not the same company that it was and i"
"11432710","11435930"," didn't own microsoft during that time and so if you look at the market it's going to be up eight"
"11435930","11441450"," percent here bomber bomber you know he's a he's turned out to be a much better basketball owner"
"11441450","11446330"," team owner than he was a CEO during that point so you've got somebody in there that expressed a"
"11446330","11453050"," strategy clearly that has a clear strategy i mean how brilliant was it to invest when they did in"
"11453050","11457170"," ai they've got 13 billion in there those are the type moves i like i just think it's interesting"
"11457170","11461570"," that they're gonna take a break i'm gonna take a break subscription model now which is you know"
"11461570","11465250"," deserves a big premium still gonna take the break i'm coming up portfolio plays a bunch of"
"11465250","11469850"," committee stocks are on the move right now we have calls on them to retail cyber energy and many"

"11657450","11662490"," percent in the u.s or up 7 percent in canada they were up 30 almost 13 percent so they"

"11685910","11691710"," drawback of the only drawback i would say with costco is it is an expensive stock right so so 7740"
"11691710","11695670"," is somewhat of a stretch if you're looking at retail though i believe it is the banner name that's"
"11695670","11700950"," the one to own so i'm comfortable with the price target all right uh Jenny Palo Alto named top pick"

"12615530","12619430"," somewhat of the benefit of the doubt that this pullback should be healthy but you also see i think"
"12619430","12624530"," the fragility of the conviction levels of people who either want to see the economy remain"

"13522690","13526190"," think a stronger the stronger they're expected jobs report offered markets are less than in what"
"13526190","13530930"," the Fed has kind of been talking about the improvement in inflation the slowing of economy it's not"
"13530930","13535630"," a straight line though beneath the hood there there is some slowing going on let me just show you"
"13535630","13542130"," here the top line numbers non-farm payrolls 216 there were down revisions again of 71,000 10 of the"
"13542130","13548190"," past 11 reports have been revised to the downside unemployment rate though down to 3.7 percent a"
"13548190","13553430"," tick down participation rate that wasn't good average hourly earnings though up just a little bit 4 "
"13553430","13557750",".1 percent on the average hourly earnings there was some weakness in in the report that I think"
"13557750","13562410"," under the hood it looks to have captured the market's attention here and caused it not to be quite"
"13562410","13568110"," so concerned about it three month average for for the total shows is declined to 165,000 from 334"
"13568110","13575770"," the private sectors fall 115 from 271 last January so the three month average is slowly cooling"
"13575770","13583630"," private sector up 164,000 this month though but government was 52,000 of the total there leisure"
"13583630","13588410"," and hospitality still making up grounds on the pandemic health care that doesn't matter what's"
"13588410","13593130"," going on in the economy we need to hire nurses and doctors that was up 38,000 one leading indicator"
"13593130","13598970"," though temporary help down 33,000 it's been down several months in a row other cooling science as"
"13598970","13602650"," Kelly mentioned came from the eyes of the service sector with the top line coming in below"
"13602650","13607790"," expectations the price component and the employment index both fell and this is what I was talking"
"13607790","13613070"," about here all this data creating a lot of volatility in the Fed before the jobs reported 65"
"13613070","13619130"," probably that March cut fell to 57 percent after the rose to 57 percent after the jobs report and"
"13619130","13625270"," then it rose again after the ISM at 68 percent all that's to say the market is still pretty sure"
"13625270","13630170"," of that March cut but maybe now has embraced just a bit more of the doubt the big question is"
"13630170","13635590"," this after a year when the job market remained strong and inflation came down how much should we"
"13635590","13641390"," really care about the job market and it's in let's ask Diane Swank I bet she has some thoughts on"
"13641390","13645390"," it our next guest says diverging data is putting the Fed between a rock and a hard place and it's"
"13645390","13649890"," inflation fighting she thinks the biggest mistake would be cutting rates too soon Diane Swank is"
"13649890","13657180"," chief economist at KPMG well what are your thoughts today Diane well I think Steve did a good"
"13657180","13661620"," summary there one of the things I would go into is the devil is in the details and one of"
"13661620","13666460"," the surprises in the report was in the household survey and that almost all of the loss in"
"13666460","13672120"," employment that we saw in the household survey versus that establishment report payroll report was"
"13672120","13677520"," due to the fact that people left the labor force mostly those over 55 left labor force just"
"13677520","13682860"," unmasked during the month and that's really stunning we also had record number of people out on"
"13682860","13688780"," vacation for the month of December ever for the month of December so revenge travel has become"
"13688780","13694640"," systemic now I think that's really interesting we had an all-time high on multi multiple job"
"13694640","13701680"," holders that in the 2000s back in the 1990s it wasn't this way but ever since the 2001 recession"
"13701680","13708540"," we've seen multiple job holders rising to during a tighter labor market because employers have been"
"13708540","13713740"," more willing to be flexible with workers of course it's a bit of a sad commentary that multiple job"
"13713740","13720580"," holders are necessary in an economy and I think what we're seeing is none like the 1990s when"
"13720580","13725980"," multiple job holders actually fell as the labor market tightened we see multiple job holders go to"
"13725980","13732000"," a record high those also going on voluntary part-time employment went to a record high this month"
"13732000","13738500"," so in that data we also I mean the wage data you talked about it only creeping up slightly Steve"
"13738500","13745700"," we saw that huge surge in non-supervisory manufacturing wages due to the UAW contracts and some"
"13745700","13752540"," spillover that really surprised me in the retail sector as well that was not expected and the gains"
"13752540","13758160"," that we saw there are things that the Fed are watching because they're worried that wages may not"
"13758160","13764500"," come down to be consistent to hold inflation at its 2 target over the long haul I just want to"
"13764500","13768160"," bounce the following off both of you and is looking back through you know some of the real rates"
"13768160","13772360"," and what's been going on with markets and that we've had this increase in real rates over the past"
"13772360","13777560"," week literally 165 up to 185 I don't think it's a coincidence that we're seeing stocks stumble in"
"13777560","13781820"," the meantime and Steve I wonder if this is because the Fed has been pushing back on the rate cut"
"13781820","13786440"," narrative we've seen some officials doing so we saw the minutes kind of doing so is the market"
"13786440","13792140"," trying to tell us no they should be cutting here you know even the inflation expectations have not"
"13792140","13798500"," picked up no in October two and a half percent on the five-year we're down at 218 so it"
"13798500","13803060"," seems to be saying to them you have the space you can you can take the cuts but I don't"
"13803060","13807460"," hear their rhetoric kind of setting us up for that I don't think so either I think the Fed has"
"13807460","13812980"," other considerations that it needs to take into account which is the consideration of what if that"
"13812980","13817820"," is the wrong call what the Fed does not want to be doing is in the pro it being the"
"13817820","13823300"," business of reversing itself again so it's going to be darn sure that inflation is vanquished and"
"13823300","13830080"," extinguished before that happens I do think Dan I need to just warn you that I'm in the process of"
"13830080","13838360"," a conversion here I'm converting almost entirely to ADP wage data oh I'm not quite there yet I got"
"13838360","13842760"," a meeting next week with Neal Richardson that's off the record for the moment but is going to"
"13842760","13847540"," create so it's really great data let me tell you what the story I just found out is which is"
"13847540","13857500"," that the Atlanta with the Atlanta Fed wage tracker uses a survey sample of 2,000 employees you want"
"13857500","13866300"," to know what ADP is 110 million and it's not serving data it's paycheck data"
"13866300","13875120"," so I'll tell you that's the reason I did not highlight in my report maybe I should have told you"
"13875120","13879380"," so is ADP wage data been softer than what the deal has been coming down I doubt miss Betsy Spring"
"13879380","13884420"," has in the background the chart we use this morning it's been coming down and coming down carefully"

"14211610","14216290"," to remember that's not the same as no landing and so if we really do have this slowdown in hiring"
"14216290","14221690"," that does edge up the unemployment rate that's a squeeze on margins and that's what we saw in the"

"16655650","16659610"," much for having me so i'm curious how you on the one here sort of saying look the bear case"
"16659610","16666550"," has begun and yet you remain bullish what's behind that i guess it you know as we've come out into"
"16666550","16671150"," 2024 and and people are very aware of what performance has looked like over the last few years"
"16671150","16676130"," we've had a few people question the fact that airbnb has only grown room nights by about eight"
"16676130","16682410"," percent on a per year over the last four years and that's a lot less than what the market expects"
"16682410","16686529"," it to grow out over the next four years and so we wanted to have a look at that and"
"16686529","16692169"," say well actually rooms or properties maybe have grown at eight percent but what's really happening"
"16692169","16695790"," what's a real volume and measure we should be looking at is customer numbers and that's growing"
"16695790","16700529"," more like ten percent because the properties on average have got bigger and so therefore looking"
"16700529","16706630"," just purely at property numbers he's not showing the true volume growth of airbnb is the limit and"
"16706630","16711570"," so how you know i understand fundamentally why you need volume growth for the stock to do well but"
"16711570","16717650"," there's still an argument to be made for you know profitability so just kind of balance those two"
"16717650","16721610"," factors how important is volume growth why do you think that's the real metric people need to be"
"16721610","16726590"," watching yeah i mean i think there's a lot of operational leverage in selling travel i mean let's"
"16726590","16730930"," say it's a business that doesn't have a very large cost of sales particularly for airbnb because"
"16730930","16736070"," it's very low in its marketing spend and so if you do deliver that volume growth and price growth"
"16736070","16741169"," but people tend to prefer volume growth you will deliver the margin expansion on top of that so i"
"16741169","16746270"," think it's always been the key metric the airbnb needs to show that it's gaining share of the"
"16746270","16751930"," lodging market and we believe it comfortably has been and comfortable will continue to do so as we"
"16751930","16758910"," look forward what do you think is behind the the kind of bear case on the stock is it it's"
"16758910","16765710"," that airbnb's have gotten too expensive that the growth rate has peaked all of the above yeah i"
"16765710","16769790"," think that's i think that's that that's key i think you know one the stock does trade on a"
"16769790","16775050"," reasonably high multiple so the bar is set by i and i think there's a a concern that airbnb maybe"
"16775050","16780750"," is a value product and it needs a value proposition relative to hotels that means that customers"

"17528670","17533530"," cut if you were to kind of you know land land on planet earth and look at the united states"

"17614270","17621550"," know i'd like to dive in a little bit more on on how you get to a recession scenario if"
"17621550","17628110"," as you just said a moment ago you landed on planet earth and you saw us inflation at three percent"
"17628110","17634790"," and unemployment rate at three point seven percent and payroll payrolls gaining you would say this"
"17634790","17641150"," is not the time to protectively cut interest rates in anticipation of a slowing economy you would"

"17702970","17707330"," standout is is the employment picture that that's actually kind of working against that narrative"
"17707330","17713410"," if you look at the ISM report manufacturing's in recession the service sector is barely treading"
"17713410","17719870"," water according to that report if you look at components of the unemployment report there are"

"17822890","17827970"," to stop it is to actually kind of lower rates and and try to manage that process and we think"
"17827970","17832010"," that they'll have to do that although you know to be honest with you we would have expected that to"
"17832010","17837210"," be more weakness by now but just because there's not evident weakness now it doesn't mean that what"

"17852650","17856850"," fed rate cuts or that the fed's going to abandon its inflation principles and i just don't think"
"17856850","17861870"," that's like six rate cuts a quarter point each time that's a buck 50 so that would take rates down"

"20982940","20985580"," think that's where the performance is going to come from and that's what you need to be aware of"
"20985580","20990600"," but you think it's coming from the laggards the health cares the energies we mentioned small caps"
"20990600","20996360"," well well why health care and energy both of those are actually going to be beneficiaries of well"
"20996360","20999820"," specifically health care is going to be a beneficiary of lower interest rates right I mean you're"
"20999820","21003400"," going to see more M&A activity you're going to see as they need to borrow more money it's going"
"21003400","21006740"," to become more feasible for them so I think you're going to see a lot of that as we go"
"21006740","21010560"," into 2024 yeah what about energy I mean energy is a big wildcard you know a lot of people trying"
"21010560","21013820"," to get on that side of the boat saying okay you know it had a great year a couple years"
"21013820","21019080"," ago last year was a total dud and now is going to be the year yet again because supply demand"
"21019080","21023160"," is still out of balance what you take well I think that's the big thing it's just a supply and"
"21023160","21027720"," demand question and I think that really still leads into our favor energy and specifically a lot of"
"21027720","21032560"," the energy company is back in 2020 when prices really went out of whack they had to become so much"
"21032560","21036680"," more efficient so kind of regardless of what's happening with energy prices as long as they stay"
"21036680","21040720"," relatively in the range that they've been in I think those companies are going to continue to you"
"21040720","21045580"," know show the good profits that people are hopeful we feel like is riding on next week's CPI you"
"21045580","21050780"," know today you have these as we wrote in the top we have these gyrations in interest rates and and"
"21050780","21054920"," also in the performance of the markets you know the jobs report comes out wages and the jobs"
"21054920","21059900"," reporter a bit stronger than expected so yields start to tick up then the services report comes out"
"21059900","21066880"," yields tick down and now they're moving back up in the 10 years at 404 what's the area that you"
"21066880","21073320"," get concerned in I think we need to continue to see inflation coming down that's the ultimate thing"
"21073320","21077280"," and I don't think one number is necessarily going to affect things too negatively it's not going to"
"21077280","21081680"," be this perfect straight downwards trend but I think over time we need to continue to see those"
"21081680","21085960"," numbers come forward because ultimately the Fed is that over and over again their data dependent if"
"21085960","21089740"," the data doesn't support then pausing and lowering interest rates you're not going to see that"
"21089740","21094940"," happen but I just wonder you know because the market was so uneasy it felt this week you know even"
"21094940","21101880"," though as you said one week doesn't a new story make necessarily that a disappointing CPI is going"
"21101880","21107720"," to have maybe a larger impact because we're already kind of wondering okay maybe we were a little"
"21107720","21111980"," over our skis on the idea that they're going to cut six times okay and I think that's the big"
"21111980","21116240"," thing the cutting six if not seven times depending on what you look at that's the thing where I"
"21116240","21120220"," think probably people have gotten a little bit over their skis and so any little bit of poor"
"21120220","21123760"," information people are going to start to realize okay maybe it's not going to be at the feds only"
"21123760","21127820"," said it's probably going to be three times but bigger pictures I think likely interest are still"
"21127820","21131840"," coming down but yes you're I think some of that exuberance of the six to seven times probably going"
"21131840","21135480"," to come back let's bring in CNBC contributor Stephanie Link of high tower into the conversation"
"21135980","21140660"," Steph it's great to add you so what's your big takeaway then from the way that this week has"
"21140660","21147020"," started and this year has started that the economic data is supporting the soft landing that all of"
"21147020","21151300"," us are talking about I always worry that when we're all talking about the same thing but you got to"
"21151300","21156180"," look at the number of Scott and it's not just the job report today and then look at ADP look"
"21156180","21161540"," at challenger gray look at initial claims which is leading indicate in a leading indicator that's"
"21161540","21167540"," at two hundred and seven thousand four-week moving average so far from a recession but then I also"
"21167540","21171700"," look at durable goods and I looked at factory orders and those numbers came in better than expected"
"21171700","21177760"," with business spending intentions going higher so there are parts of the manufacturing part of the"
"21177760","21183240"," economy that are seeing a pickup because of the onshoring the reshoring all the infrastructure"
"21183240","21188120"," bills that have been put in place so you kind of add it all up the growth is there obviously"
"21188120","21193980"," we all want to see the inflation numbers come down so that the Fed can cut but it's not it's"
"21193980","21199140"," still at you know 4.1 percent is still okay but it's elevated so that's why I don't think the"
"21199140","21203740"," Fed is going to cut six times this year and if by the way they do that means we have"
"21203740","21209560"," a massive decline and a turn around to the downside in the economy and I just don't see it at"
"21209560","21215680"," this moment in time so the three takeaways I think fewer cuts I think better earnings and I think"
"21215680","21222320"," the consumer has actually been really strong and and I'm really encouraged by Costco and I know"
"21222320","21229260"," Costco is a beast in itself but you had a hundred basis point acceleration x the one extra day that"
"21229260","21235500"," they had this month from the first quarter a hundred basis points acceleration and you had a 400"
"21235500","21242860"," basis point acceleration in non-food purchases that's discretionary so my thinking is maybe"
"21242860","21247980"," services is coming down a little bit from the torrid pace that we've seen but maybe that we've seen"
"21247980","21253300"," the bottom in the goods side of the economy and the goods buying in the economy so let's keep an"
"21253300","21258480"," eye on it but I'm pretty encouraged you start to worry at what point that the strong numbers that"
"21258480","21266900"," you always cite as a point of strength in the in the market story undercuts the cuts and then the"
"21266900","21274030"," market has to reprice itself well I think that that's what we're dealing with this week you know I"
"21274030","21280050"," think six cuts got way ahead of themselves I definitely do not think they're going in March I think"
"21280050","21285230"," maybe they do three we'll have to see I mean we're you know we're all data dependent including the"
"21285230","21290730"," Fed so CPI number next week is huge um and and the PPI is pretty big as well and then"
"21290730","21294230"," earnings we'll listen to what the companies have to say and how they're dealing with all of these"
"21294230","21301410"," moving parts but I do think whether the Fed cuts three four five one or two earnings are going to"
"21301410","21305310"," come in better than expected because demand is actually better than expected and I really feel very"
"21305310","21311890"," strongly that the margin side is going to stay strong especially because wages are coming down"
"21311890","21317090"," input costs are coming down supply chains are getting fixed you agree with that comment Courtney"
"21317090","21320990"," that earnings are going to come in better than expected that Steph just made I do actually and I"
"21320990","21324670"," think the idea that this earnings recession is ending and we're only going to see improvements from"
"21324670","21328770"," here I think is really what we're looking forward to I think she makes a really good point that the"
"21328770","21333690"," consumer is strong right now right ultimately we are consumer driven economy and even if wages do"
"21333690","21337330"," start to come down people are starting to spend into their savings they've they've really built up"
"21337330","21340790"," during covid so maybe we do start to see a little bit of a slowdown but as long as we"
"21340790","21344230"," have a tight labor market people do have the mean to spend and we have a very confident consumer"
"21344230","21348810"," and that likely is going to lead its way right into earnings yeah I mean Steph you like the same"
"21348810","21356830"," sectors in in a sense that court does right health care energy maybe in some respects small caps"
"21356830","21363650"," too but you know here we are again with a lot of people talking about the very same places that"
"21363650","21369290"," they think are going to work this year I know I know and that bothers me a little bit we"
"21369290","21373510"," don't we don't all want to be on the same side of the boat but I really do believe that"
"21373510","21380490"," there's real value in these sectors I mean the valuations are are tremendous and the free cash flow"
"21380490","21384670"," let's just say health care and energy let's just take those two I mean the free cash flows in both"
"21384670","21392050"," are substantial the last 12 months in health care we've had almost 400 billion dollars in M&A and"
"21392050","21397770"," it's gone practically unnoticed and I think you're going to see a real step up in that in that"
"21397770","21401850"," activity in the health care space but by the way you're now all of a sudden starting to see it"
"21401850","21407910"," in energy especially with the big guys with Chevron and Oxy and Exxon they're making acquisitions"
"21407910","21416970"," to taking advantage of these really cheap valuations so they both sectors think their sectors are"
"21416970","21422210"," cheap and companies are cheap and so do I and so I think you can see real returns and a"
"21422210","21427310"," catch-up a catch-up trade this year I'm not giving up on Tech Scott but I do think there's"
"21427310","21432130"," better value elsewhere and it's encouraging let's talk about a couple things I want to because I"
"21432130","21436870"," want to ask you about this adding to energy and the fact that you know you used to be in"
"21436870","21442710"," Chevron talked about it all the time kind of got fed up and sold it and now have bought Exxon"
"21442710","21446710"," so give me give me that first and then I want to go a little bit deeper on this mega"
"21446710","21453810"," cap tech conversation yeah no I mean look Exxon they've been executing a lot better over the last"
"21453810","21460650"," couple of years versus Chevron and that's a reversal and so it's a little frustrating with Chevron"
"21460650","21465890"," and and the charge offs and the write downs that they have to take they're not immune I know but"
"21465890","21470870"," they seem to be more frequent and so I just didn't think that it paid to kind of wait it's"
"21470870","21478010"," cheap for sure but I like the better operator Exxon has about $38 billion in free cash flow I love"
"21478010","21483550"," the pioneer acquisition as opposed to Chevron the acquisition that they made actually is more"
"21483550","21488870"," focused international and I'm not as crazy about that so because I think the Permian the Permian"
"21488870","21493890"," deal for Exxon is really a good one and they're going to be the number one player there so five"
"21493890","21499090"," points seven times versus seven point nine times for its 10 year average with a good yield so"
"21499090","21503730"," that's why I added to that one but I'm now by the way I'm now 700 basis points overweight energy"
"21503730","21509070"," relative to the benchmark and you're underweight you know things like Apple even though you own it"
"21509070","21514070"," which is where I want to segue to so it's been an interesting week to say the least it's the"
"21514070","21521150"," worst performing mega cap tech it's down six percent in one week we rarely get downgrades on that"
"21521150","21527370"," stock this week it got to now you got the New York Times headline about regulators you know looking"
"21527370","21533030"," at the possibility of an antitrust case which on an intraday basis took that stock lower and then"
"21533030","21539280"," for obvious reasons it took the market down a bit with it big waiting out of the queues it's by"
"21539280","21547240"," it's accounted for 20 percent of the queues move this week too so it has such a large influence on"
"21547240","21555080"," everything and a doubt too of course what happens if the market has an Apple problem there's a very"
"21555080","21559760"," good chance the market has an Apple problem it's seven percent of the S&P 500 and I don't know"
"21559760","21565540"," why anyone wants to pay 30 times for negative growth I've said that to many times and you know I'm"
"21565540","21569980"," very small in it in fact on Tuesday we talked about I'm inclined to sell the rest of the 50"
"21569980","21575460"," basis points that I have there's other places to put your money but yeah okay so let's say we have"
"21575460","21579260"," an Apple problem and the market has an Apple problem because it's such a big waiting and oh by the"
"21579260","21585120"," way it's so over owned and so loved well guess what that maybe the overall market doesn't do very"
"21585120","21590840"," well or does much in the first half of the year but other stocks and other sectors will because of"
"21590840","21595800"," what we just talked about in terms of where there are opportunities where the valuations are really"
"21595800","21600580"," super cheap where you're getting good shareholder returns and you're getting good dividends and you"
"21600580","21606420"," have good stories good free cash flow stories so to me maybe the market as a whole kind of just"
"21606420","21610720"," you know trades around a little bit but I think you underneath the surface you could be a good"
"21610720","21617520"," stock picker and sector allucator and offset the problems with Apple and maybe some of the other"
"21617520","21624920"," meta stocks some of the other fangs yeah Freudian slip meta is green for sure yeah Amazon's green"
"21624920","21630500"," and videos green you know so and the queue is by the way or still green albeit slightly but what"
"21630500","21635920"," about this notion court about you know Apple being upset for a bit what does that mean to the to"
"21635920","21640040"," the market here in the early part of the year it is a problem where it's such a large part"
"21640040","21645800"," of the market especially as indexing becomes so much more popular is an investment option if Apple"
"21645800","21648780"," goes down it's going to take a lot of that down with it and that kind of goes to what"
"21648780","21651820"," I was saying where you want to make sure you're taking profits from those some of those things"
"21651820","21656440"," adding to other areas and not just throwing all your money in an s&p 500 fund because with by"
"21656440","21660040"," doing that I don't think a lot of people realize how much you are putting your money to Apple and"
"21660040","21665000"," Google and Microsoft Amazon if you are looking at an equal weight rather than the traditional s&p"
"21665000","21668620"," but see that's why we bring it up because there are a fair amount of people who invest that way"
"21668620","21675060"," or at least it's part of their investment strategy you own one of the index funds and that's why we"
"21675060","21680140"," talk about the stock all the time because the size of the weighting that it has the influence it"
"21680140","21684960"," has and why it matters so much if it goes through a period of some kind of upset remember that"
"21684960","21692980"," stock was you know 167 169 then it had this run in the upper 190s towards 200 as the overall"
"21692980","21701200"," market ripped from the end of October to the end of the year if it goes through a period and"
"21701200","21707660"," some of these other mega caps can hold up that's all good nothing nothing to see here if it's"
"21707660","21713500"," picked up by by other areas to a certain extent it's such a large section I mean the overall the"
"21713500","21717280"," overall markets are going to feel that right and I don't I you're saying a lot of people invest"
"21717280","21720660"," that way and index is I agree I actually think it's a great way to invest I think a lot"
"21720660","21724960"," of people forget there's a lot more indexes than just the SP 500 you can look at the rest of"
"21724960","21727820"," the thousand you can look at your international companies you can look alternatives like real"
"21727820","21732260"," estate and energy there's so many more things than just the S&P which people think is the entire"
"21732260","21735580"," market so it's not the only index you want to buy and I think that that's what we want to"
"21735580","21742470"," point out here Steph what happens if there's no cut in March I think that that's what we're"
"21742470","21746630"," starting to price in Scott I really know I feel like we're pricing it back up I mean if we"
"21746630","21752310"," I'm sorry to interrupt you but if you looked at the way that the market is now pricing March it's"
"21752310","21757650"," when the jobs report came out at 8 30 you know it was stronger than expected okay so the"
"21757650","21764070"," probabilities go down a little bit services comes out and it's like oh okay well now we're back up"
"21764070","21770770"," to what it was like 73 74 percent around noon time yeah today but what happens if we don't get"
"21770770","21777830"," the March cut I mean if we don't get the March cut that means the growth is better and actually"
"21777830","21783270"," that inflation is probably around the three four three and a half four percent level that's why the"
"21783270","21789470"," CPI numbers are super important but in today's jobs number I mean it implied that productivity is"
"21789470","21794250"," going to continue to go higher unit labor costs are coming down and if you and so that's very"
"21794250","21798970"," positive for inflation over the long haul and if you look at the quit rates in the jolt's numbers"
"21798970","21805030"," yesterday and that's a leading indicator and the quit rates fell pretty substantially and so that's"
"21805030","21810210"," a leading indicator for wages and so I think we're going to see inflation come down but growth"
"21810210","21815430"," remain elevated but wages and inflation isn't going to come down enough for the Fed to really say"
"21815430","21819290"," okay we can actually go I don't think it matters I think it's as long as the growth can hang"
"21819290","21823290"," in there earnings are going to hang in there and that's what we need to pay attention to let me"
"21823290","21828050"," ask you this I'm looking at a journal headline right now that says southwestern and Chesapeake near"
"21828050","21835930"," a 17 billion dollar merger it just speaks to you know what may be in play this year more more"
"21835930","21841110"," M&A more deal making I mean this obviously is straight out of the energy patch but when I read"
"21841110","21848130"," you a headline like that what's your reaction it's exactly what I expect exactly what we've been"
"21848130","21854290"," seeing from some of these the big companies but you know these smaller companies see value in"
"21854290","21858530"," getting bigger and getting scaled to compete with the big guys right so especially as the big guys"
"21858530","21863310"," are getting bigger so I think the free cash flow look cash break evens at Chevron and Exxon is"
"21863310","21870510"," about $35 in oil where are we today we're double that so these companies are minting money so I"
"21870510","21876870"," would much rather see them do M&A versus over produce and also return the cash to shareholders"
"21876870","21881750"," which is exactly what they're doing at these stocks are trading at 567 times earnings which is nuts"
"21881750","21887130"," so I like what I hear and I think look I mean the S&P 500 energy is about a"
"21887130","21891510"," 4% weight no one is there even though a lot of people like it I think there's more that"
"21891510","21897370"," can happen where we can see it be a more a larger contribution to the waiting overall expect more"
"21897370","21901610"," deals absolutely yeah if rates come down we think they will that's definitely going to lead to more"
"21901610","21905630"," M&A and that's that's going to affect energy it's going to affect health care all things we're"
"21905630","21909570"," talking about that's a big part of that all right great stuff Courtney thanks can see again Steph"
"21909570","21913890"," thanks as well we'll see you soon that's Courtney Garcia and Stephanie link let's send it over now"

"22212440","22219620"," last year and the first for trading days of this year been really terrible I can see what the"
"22219620","22224520"," market struggling with because as your guests previously talked about you know part of it is when"
"22224520","22230840"," the fed cuts and I think people are still jumpy about a strong labor market in place this evening"
"22230840","22237040"," but our base case still remains that you know we're going to see all-time highs in January and then"
"22237040","22241840"," I think the market is tough in the first half of this year because of some of those things but"
"22241840","22246100"," we'll we'll overall end up strong by the end of the year well you're not you're not rethinking your"
"22246100","22252160"," own outlook at all by you know how I mean you obviously sound somewhat concerned by the way this"
"22252160","22257880"," year has started maybe it didn't go according to your plan so how's that all factoring into your"
"22257880","22263800"," psyche well yeah I mean I think it is disappointing because you know the year tends to play out in"
"22263800","22270740"," in January so the fact that we're you know sort of had a failed Santa Claus rally and the first"
"22270740","22276080"," five days is pretty important and the market looks like it's going to be negative just tells you"
"22276080","22281840"," that um the fundamentals might which which have been improving aren't necessarily going to convince"
"22281840","22287660"," investors to be buying stock so I do think it's telling us it's going to be a tough year but"
"22287660","22293220"," the reason I'm we're not wavering is that the the reasons we think 2024 will be a good year for"
"22293220","22298540"," stocks has to do with the fact that the PMIs are bottoming and inflation is falling like a rock and"
"22298540","22304280"," the Fed has pivoted and is now managing a business cycle I mean those are really good anchors and"
"22304280","22308920"," supports for why stocks can do well but you know it's not a great start I mean what if you'd"
"22308920","22313120"," be much better if we were up for the week yeah well I mean bulls would feel better what about"
"22313120","22320520"," this ISM services report I mean I know you talk about PMIs but is that concerning to you well it's"
"22320520","22327140"," uh there's there's pluses and minuses I mean to me um I think the ISM services employment number"
"22327140","22333880"," and you know the manufacturing number show you that the labor report we got today may not be as"
"22333880","22338460"," strong as it looks and I think that's actually good because we don't want a labor market showing"
"22338460","22344200"," signs of rejuvenation I think the trend there is is sort of softer employment growth and from a"
"22344200","22347820"," prices perspective I think it's pretty supportive of what we've been seeing which is you know"
"22347820","22355460"," prices are falling in as long as housing and cars don't surge um you know housing growing at 3%"
"22355460","22361000"," is fine that's consistent with 2% inflation I think inflation is gonna eventually be viewed as you"
"22361000","22366820"," know approaching target and that's actually good so uh Scott you know the data isn't always in a"
"22366820","22371240"," straight line I think it's a little messy this week and I think it is disappointing to see but I"
"22371240","22376880"," think too many are gonna be quickly turning bearish and then put on their hard landing or skeptic"
"22376880","22381500"," hat or the fed hawk hat and I think that's gonna prove to be a mistake so you you look"
"22381500","22391780"," for about 10% out of the from from here how many cuts do you need to get that well"
"22391780","22398440"," you know it's uh it's not as dependent on cuts as it's dependent on really inflation approaching"
"22398440","22404400"," you know what we'd all accept as like you know close enough to 2% so that the fed is"
"22404400","22409300"," no longer fighting inflation so it's not going to be as important as cuts is really sort of the"
"22409300","22414520"," quality of the inflation data and I think the second is that you know we do need to have a"
"22414520","22419820"," rebound in earnings and global growth which I do think is underway and you know as you know"
"22419820","22424700"," inflation is normalizing outside the US and when you have that combination of inflation sort of"
"22424700","22429840"," normalizing and real growth recovery I mean that's that's good for stock so it's not it's not"
"22429840","22434240"," dependent on the number of cuts well I don't know I could almost make the argument that it's it's"
"22434240","22438380"," one and the same I mean if if you get the number of cuts that the market is seemingly priced"
"22438380","22445380"," in it means that inflation has continued to move down rapidly towards target and if you don't it"
"22445380","22451140"," likely means that inflation has gotten a little bit more sticky than the bulls had wanted it to be"
"22451140","22455760"," so it impacts the ability and the wherewithal of the fed to actually start cutting rates and doing"
"22455760","22461640"," it nearly as many times as the market still expects yeah I hear you I think the problem people have"
"22461640","22466240"," is when they talk about cuts they they were signing singular drivers for it you know I heard"
"22466240","22470400"," someone say well they make a lot of cuts it's because the economy is in trouble that's not the case"
"22470400","22475720"," the fed could be cutting rapidly because they've concluded that inflation is actually approaching"
"22475720","22480680"," normalization and you know a nominal fed funds at five and three eighths or almost five and a half"
"22480680","22484540"," percent the upper end is not appropriate when you're at two percent inflation I mean that's three"
"22484540","22490880"," percent real fed funds at the same time the fed may not have to cut the market could actually"
"22490880","22496340"," conclude this by seeing interest rates fall so we could be in a situation this year where the 10"
"22496340","22504060"," year is at 3.2 and FOMC members may be wavering but the stock market will rally because it knows"
"22504060","22508240"," the fed is behind the curve and needs to cut so I guess this is the reason why I'm saying"
"22508240","22512460"," the cuts aren't as important as really the quality of the inflation improvement and maybe it's more"
"22512460","22516780"," important to see what rates actually do before I let you go I want to ask you about apple I"
"22516780","22520820"," know you're still bullish on mega caps but you don't expect them to outperform to the magnitude"
"22520820","22526700"," that they did in 2023 this stock has obviously not looked good this week it's down more than six"
"22526700","22534040"," percent variety of reasons and we listed them earlier downgrades chatter about antitrust etc if the"
"22534040","22538040"," stock goes through a period of upset as I asked our prior two guests I want to ask you the"
"22538040","22545600"," same question what happens to stocks well it's the thing the destiny of S&P really does hang on"
"22545600","22552000"," fang because it's such a large weight I don't think fangs are sell this year because you know they"
"22552000","22555800"," actually de-rated over the last two years you know their earnings outperformed the stock price"
"22555800","22562620"," performance but you are getting periods like this where you know people get nervous it's one reason"
"22562620","22569200"," why I do think the story in 2024 is going to be a lot more about small caps and and"
"22569200","22573180"," sort of some of the lagger groups you know financials are their our number one large cap sector"
"22573180","22579340"," pick but I mean if I owned apple I wouldn't be a seller here you know their franchise and sort"
"22579340","22584800"," of returns on investment are still enviable so you know if it's down six percent but was that 44"
"22584800","22589640"," last year you know I I think people have to kind of look through that all right we'll leave it"

"22833980","22839780"," correlated from the tenure and as yields had gone up we were under pressure as they came down"
"22839780","22845640"," biotech definitely made that move but I really want to be clear there are fundamentals that are"

"24217080","24222480"," an immediate drop at 215 when the headline but it was almost all due to apple itself it wasn't the"
"24222480","24227720"," rest of the market spilling out so you can do without apple leadership i don't think that you can"
"24227720","24232680"," necessarily lose all of the many caps obviously and so have the index hang together all right we're"
"24232680","24237660"," not yet 4,700 we're close we're going to settle out right around there 50 a few points below it"

"24306780","24311760"," make of it all you know morgan it seems as if the market was a bit apprehensive in terms of"
"24311760","24317140"," how to interpret the economic data but it didn't stray too far from the premise that we have a"
"24317140","24322480"," slowing economy but one that's not falling apart there's still support of worker income growth you"

"24351240","24355340"," still in a bit a moment of confusion about how to price what the fed's going to do and what"
"24355340","24359940"," yields might do from here after they've lee tired to about 4% of the 10 year mike i want"
"24359940","24364600"," to talk about apple for a moment because in two o'clock eastern hour right after the new york times"
"24364600","24372040"," headline crossed about the doj going after apple potentially over antitrust stuff the major indices"
"24372040","24378600"," dipped ended up in the green but didn't recover at least you know the s&p the nasdaq didn't all"
"24378600","24384720"," the ground that it lost this one's fascinating to me not because it's a shock we've known that the"
"24384720","24393100"," doj and some other others have been after bigness it's that apple of all the big tech companies to"
"24393100","24398900"," meet is nothing close to a monopoly as a platform it's got less than 50% share i mean it"
"24398900","24405060"," doesn't have monopoly share in watches you have to create a market that exists as apple into itself"
"24405060","24411940"," premium smartphones or it has a it has a monopoly in software on its own devices in order to create"
"24411940","24418020"," something big tech has been such a big part of public markets for the last couple of years this"
"24418020","24425820"," kind of assault potentially on them is market relevant it is and you know traditionally and by that"
"24425820","24430940"," i mean over the last couple of decades when you get one of these headlines when regulators are said"
"24430940","24435840"," to be really looking into the competitive mode of one of these big companies and the stock reacts"
"24435840","24440540"," it's tended to be a fade in other words you tend to want to bet against the idea that this"
"24440540","24445080"," is going to really be relevant for the long term in terms of the value of the company that said"
"24445080","24450500"," i do think that there's a relatively sweeping nature to this supported investigation and even if"
"24450500","24456640"," apple does not have absolute dominant market share it has a massive market share and if they are"
"24456640","24463540"," said to be excluding other apps that compete with their own products within that ecosystem i think"
"24463540","24467360"," a case can be made and i don't think the market i mean look it's down a little one less"
"24467360","24472840"," than one percent on the day it's down ten percent from its high you had fragile sentiment in apple"
"24472840","24477220"," as it was and i think there probably also was a sense out there of oh wait maybe this is"
"24477220","24481840"," what the stock was partially telling us in its weakness recently that there was this work underway"
"24481840","24487140"," but i think you have to pay attention to it along with the idea that maybe there's less urgency to"
"24487140","24492420"," the iPhone upgrade cycle that maybe they've seen the peak of their own kind of brand dominance in"
"24492420","24496820"," certain areas you know no paddock time but it is something that i think you're going to have to"
"24496820","24501040"," filter into the valuation yeah and of course this idea that maybe multiples were stretched right i"
"24501040","24505540"," mean and and you talked about it was just like a week two weeks ago that that you saw apple"
"24505540","24510840"," testing that two hundred dollar level i guess it was the middle of december which was basically the"
"24510840","24515100"," same same level it reached during the summer it was an all-time high so that was being watched as"
"24515100","24519800"," sort of a key technical factor on whether this was going to be a bullish breakout for apple or"
"24519800","24523920"," whether we were going to see a pullback here so perhaps some some technical positioning as well as"
"24523920","24528280"," we start the year and by the way not just apple that's right yeah it's just it's somewhat"
"24528280","24532340"," emblematic of what what else has been going on in and some of those other stuff now apple has"
"24532340","24537000"," underperformed some of the other ones so you know you have to keep that in mind it does not have"
"24537000","24543100"," the tailwind of just this organic top line growth that's just there and you can rely on for a while"
"24543100","24547760"," so that's been part of the struggle with that stock in particular all right mike thanks we'll see"
"24547760","24551260"," again in just a bit more than i think the question here with this apple thing for me is are"
"24551260","24557100"," we china or are we a country where the capitalist system sits on top of rule of law where if"
"24557100","24562360"," you want to create a law where bigness is bad when you tie ecosystems together then create it but"
"24562360","24571200"," to try to enforce a law that doesn't exist or to try to through the court system create law uh"
"24571200","24577520"," business can't sustain that in an unstable environment and that that to me is why you end up with"
"24577520","24582200"," these pockets of time where people are saying well is the chinese market investable because you"
"24582200","24585920"," know the government does something in stocks tank because we don't we don't know what to expect i i"
"24585920","24589400"," get the comparison although i think there's still like a very stark difference and especially when"
"24589400","24592860"," we talk about rule of law between the u.s and china and what that means from an investor standpoint"
"24592860","24598360"," um but i i to your point i do think there is a ticking clock here because we are an"
"24598360","24604120"," election year uh in terms of regulators who have been making the case building the case for a"
"24604120","24609680"," number of years now to try and get those cases out there what that looks like how it goes through"
"24609680","24615220"," the court system etc etc time will tell um but the fact that it will go through a court system"
"24615220","24619680"," assuming that this actually moves forward in the case is actually presented i think is the big"
"24619680","24624200"," difference there is a difference is it stark that's where here's the question well let's get to our"
"24624200","24629880"," market panel joining us now is 248 ventures chief strategist Lindsey Bell and city global chief"
"24629880","24636760"," economist nathan sheets guys happy friday nathan uh going back to the jobs report this this morning"
"24636760","24643360"," doesn't this take six cuts off the table or or no is that what the market was in in part"
"24643360","24650840"," trying to digest i think today's uh data overall were very much mixed bag yeah you got a bit of"
"24650840","24658440"," an upside surprise on the payrolls numbers but it's still paints a picture of a gradually slowing"
"24658440","24665080"," economy maybe a little bit of weight pressure that the feds gonna want to keep its eyes on but in"
"24665080","24673600"," on balance a an easing labor market and then that was reinforced by the services ISM which was was"
"24673600","24680220"," quite soft probably influenced to some extent by seasonal adjustment issues but if you waited the"
"24680220","24685540"," week thinking the fair was going to cut in march i think you can leave the week with that same"
"24685540","24693180"," view my personal perspective is uh wait and see i kind of expect them later later in the year maybe"
"24693180","24700400"," later in the second quarter but uh nothing nothing to really move the dial today or during the the"
"24700400","24708020"," past week Lindsey you think the fed cuts in march and then six cuts are even possible i don't i"
"24708020","24711820"," don't see six cuts but i think there's a lot of moving parts that you have to take into"
"24711820","24716760"," consideration i think a march cut is really going to be predicated on what happens with inflation"
"24716760","24722540"," and we get three inflation readings the first of which comes next week before that march meeting so"
"24722540","24725860"," i think there's a lot of data that we need to digest the fed needs to digest they're going to"
"24725860","24731380"," continue to be data dependent before making any decisions um but i do think that the minutes that"
"24731380","24736380"," we got from the fed this week from their December meeting show a fed that is while while they"
"24736380","24742700"," believe rates may have peaked they don't necessarily want they to me they took the march cut off"
"24742700","24747980"," the table in those minutes so the so chair chair pal was pretty dovish in the press conference"
"24747980","24752520"," after that December meeting but the but these minutes were much more hawkish and i think that's"
"24752520","24758220"," what investors grappled with all week was mixed messages even contracting messages from lots of"
"24758220","24762940"," different data points this week you know which by the way the market hasn't been the market has"
"24762940","24768520"," been wrong before it's that old mantra in some ways Nathan if don't fight the fed the other piece"
"24768520","24773520"," of this puzzle though and certainly one that you know there's skepticism surrounding is the"
"24773520","24781820"," consensus estimates for 12 s and p 500 earnings growth this year is that too is that too lofty well"
"24781820","24791340"," i never would count u.s. corporates out but by the same token that is a very rapid earnings growth"
"24791340","24798800"," in a macro environment that is likely to be lackluster you know it is consistent what we're seeing"
"24798800","24806380"," is consistent with the soft landing but that means slower nominal GDP growth and i think that that"
"24806380","24808440"," will take a bite out of those "
