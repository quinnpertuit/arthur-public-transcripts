"280100","280180"," Right. "
"280620","285000"," We know the top of the key is actually way up here like four thirty nine."
"285900","288640"," Uh we could explode there if we could."
"288880","290420"," I don't I mean I don't think we're going there. "
"290600","292360"," I think we're going to like four twenty ish."
"293980","298800"," Uh we had four oh three I think as the first target then four ten and then four twenty."
"299000","301020"," I think I posted that on fin twit at one point. "
"301020","303280"," I was unsure if it would happen this morning."
"304120","304800"," On Thursday."
"305460","308300"," I'm going to I'm still going to expect some profit taking. "
"308780","310060"," I was talking to Joe this morning."
"310220","314640"," I'm like probably we're either going to get profit taking right off the bell or we're going to get"
"314640","316260"," it by Friday for Monday."
"317360","318780"," And they didn't even wait man. "
"318920","321100"," They just they just started fucking ripping it."
"321380","325120"," Sorry for swearing right off the open here but let's take a look."
"325460","331000"," Uh let's take a look. "
"331000","332680"," If this works for you."
"332800","334140"," I mean this is what they're going for right."
"334360","339300"," This is a four hour or they're going to promise you that we're going to you know four forty five"
"339300","339680"," four sixty. "
"339780","340420"," Probably not."
"340820","342760"," But this is resistance on the channel."
"343520","348260"," Uh I know these channels don't mean anything but you know there are bulls out there that are like. "
"348940","352180"," There are some FOMO or is there like we're going here eventually."
"352640","354320"," So they're going to try to drive it there."
"355000","355500"," Right now. "
"355620","356740"," Do I think we go there right now?"
"356920","357080"," No."
"357620","357940"," I don't."
"358080","359200"," We're we're frothy right now. "
"359200","360920"," I want you to understand that."
"360940","363180"," Okay you're probably going to get a pull back at some point."
"363720","365620"," There are some air gaps down below. "
"366160","367640"," 420 seems logical."
"368620","370780"," And then you'd have some kind of a move higher possibly."
"371340","372560"," Uh and hit. "
"372820","373800"," This is insane."
"373800","377800"," And try to slap that four forty five or something."
"378220","380580"," Do you release the bulls the bulls start running. "
"380700","381700"," That was the one thing too."
"382160","383600"," This morning before the open I'm like."
"384240","386880"," Do we get another two percent and we're fucking. "
"387520","388880"," That's a bull run boom."
"389220","389780"," We nailed it."
"389960","391400"," Twenty percent run is a bull run. "
"391820","393760"," It's not a bull market but it is a bull run."
"394480","398620"," Uh we're like two percent away from that move right now and why not slap it up there."
"398620","401660"," We also have an air gap above here at four twenty one. "
"401860","406640"," I want you to see it up here or yeah right here is a air gap at four twenty four"
"406640","407600"," twenty ninety three."
"408260","410380"," I apologize for my voice this morning."
"411120","412700"," You can see it right here. "
"412860","418860"," We'll we'll draw this in for this little put this little air gap above here."
"419160","420640"," See if it shows up in the fifteen minute."
"421140","422700"," And they just don't care right. "
"423840","427280"," We knew yesterday it's right up here and we knew yesterday."
"428400","432940"," The closed yesterday is two things that we knew yesterday is closed we knew two things remember"
"432940","435740"," when I was in here and I'm like this is bear capitulation."
"438300","438980"," Excuse me. "
"439840","446920"," And I'm like I'm like price is not following in spy right now to ES and SPX."
"447420","452480"," They were pinning this into the close yesterday like real price if you looked at real price on SPX"
"452480","453040"," down here."
"453520","458060"," And you looked at real price on SPX and ES here it didn't follow higher and it should have into"
"458060","464520"," the close and it didn't it got pinned so we're getting squeezed up to where that was right now on"
"464520","464960"," the spy. "
"466580","467820"," That's happening right now."
"467940","470380"," There's that gap above four twenty one."
"470620","472760"," I expected this but I didn't expect it today. "
"472860","473560"," I'll be honest with you."
"473640","474300"," I was like yeah."
"475000","478460"," I was like hopefully we can get down here to this five minute candle maybe. "
"479380","481020"," We're not this spot that not that one."
"481240","481860"," I was whole second."
"482140","484800"," I was thinking I'm like oh my God please just let me get a buy. "
"485600","489640"," And they just didn't they just ripped it like the one and five minute down here as soon as they"
"489640","491860"," got down to this five minute it was gone off and running."
"491860","494340"," Didn't wait for the hourly didn't wait for anything."
"494340","496960"," They were just like let's go up there and fucking tag it. "
"497560","498080"," Okay."
"498600","499780"," Good enough for me."
"500460","505720"," I mean whatever you want to do you can see it right now right it's happening right now. "
"505720","506640"," It's playing out."
"506780","507680"," It's mind blowing."

"534760","539740"," We know that our to you know that it's going to be sellers waiting above here at some point trying"
"539740","540600"," to sell this down. "

"829920","830720"," Three forty five."
"831760","835740"," I remember when I was like I came out one morning and said buy this shit. "

"859580","863220"," I'm like how do you not buy the spy at some kind of a bottom at some point."
"863460","865660"," If I were buying it five hundred and I'm saying no."
"866000","867240"," Same on Tesla on highs. "

"940290","941090"," Hell no."
"943830","945270"," Let's look at Tesla real quick."
"947770","948310"," Okay. "
"950190","952990"," To get rid of my little my little yellow line right here."
"958690","961570"," Like a looks like a like a baby or something."
"964150","965190"," As we come up here. "
"965370","968150"," I want you to see this blue line right here."
"970290","972930"," You're likely going to get a reaction as we trade up here."
"972930","974550"," I want you to be aware of that. "
"974650","976490"," It doesn't mean we don't break through this blue line."
"976570","979610"," If you're a Tesla Tesla investor or whatever."
"980810","983690"," You need to want to talk about a few bigger things. "
"983910","987210"," But I do want you to know that you should buy bottoms."
"987930","989370"," You can decide what you do."
"990330","991750"," If you're going to take the money and run. "
"991990","994190"," If you're not going to take the money and run you have to head your positions."
"995410","996690"," It always really is that okay."
"996870","997470"," Protect your money. "
"997630","999650"," Protect your investments the stuff that you do."
"1003340","1005220"," So you get this number up here."
"1005320","1009040"," 195 86 normally it starts to you don't always get to this line. "
"1009200","1009340"," Okay."
"1010960","1012420"," So you know we could roll right here."
"1012640","1016140"," This is like a time and a place for you to protect your investment. "
"1016140","1017420"," If you're not going to sell your underlying."
"1018000","1019140"," You need to put a hedge on."
"1020200","1021680"," If we do break through this line. "
"1025630","1029390"," If price breaks above and wants to hold and make the next trade up higher."
"1030430","1032369"," This is not the place for you to be unprotected."
"1033069","1034270"," This is not the place for you to be long. "
"1034490","1035530"," It'll be long after this."
"1035770","1036630"," This here."
"1036810","1036970"," Okay. "
"1039050","1040310"," If we reject here."
"1040970","1041710"," We come back down."
"1042569","1042990"," Right. "
"1043290","1046849"," You're going to wait to position to get some confirmation that we're heading back up."
"1046849","1048950"," To retest and break through this level."
"1049830","1051130"," You need to be tactful. "
"1054690","1058850"," In protective of the money that you make and the investments that you make and stuff like that."
"1060650","1061650"," Next target above."
"1062110","1063950"," If we do get above this blue line and we hold it. "
"1066130","1068770"," 221.05. Do I think we go get straight to there?"
"1068890","1069590"," Probably not."
"1070430","1072290"," Now there's work to be done above here."
"1072690","1074970"," And I want to show you on a larger time frame what I mean. "
"1074970","1078390"," And you know that there's going to be bears above waiting for you."
"1079090","1079850"," That's legitimate."
"1080190","1082070"," Real sellers will be there waiting for you. "
"1082230","1087850"," They'll be tactful bulls that'll be there waiting to take the money and run."
"1088250","1089390"," I want you to understand that."
"1089530","1089670"," Okay. "
"1090050","1091410"," So we're coming into that right now."
"1091410","1092090"," You can see it."
"1092510","1093210"," The daily chart. "
"1093390","1094650"," We're coming in to tag it right now."
"1095190","1100510"," We know in previous examples that bears tried to sell this blue line right here."
"1100610","1101970"," They tried to sell it right here. "
"1101970","1105790"," You can see that we broke above previously that green line right."
"1106990","1108650"," Consolidated we started to break."
"1109350","1112490"," So let's just use this private exam or past example right here. "
"1113030","1114090"," Just as an example."
"1115190","1121180"," And you know we start trading up here and consolidating."
"1121280","1123200"," We don't want to turn distribution right. "
"1123840","1126740"," So you have to have a stop loss underneath or just a hedge."
"1127440","1127980"," Something."
"1129240","1129780"," Right. "
"1129780","1132820"," Especially if you're staying long on Tesla for the long term."
"1133220","1134380"," You want to protect your investment."
"1134740","1135640"," So you had your investment. "
"1136400","1138680"," And then you're going to be looking for a low to buy."
"1139380","1139480"," Right."
"1139800","1142640"," So let's say we do stay above the green line just like right here. "
"1142640","1142880"," Right."
"1144040","1145560"," And let's say this had gone up."
"1146160","1147760"," You can add to your position here. "
"1148340","1150320"," Right with a stop and a hedge below."
"1150760","1151360"," That makes sense."
"1152180","1155860"," Well you guys like truly if you're an investor if you're buying a bottom you buying a tradeable"
"1155860","1156100"," bottom. "
"1156320","1157840"," If you think this is a tradeable bottom."
"1158580","1161940"," You need to protect yourself on the way up."
"1162660","1164040"," Because you don't know what it's going to turn around. "
"1164380","1167000"," There is no right now certain certainty in this market."
"1167460","1170340"," We could come into the market on Monday and be down 300 points."
"1171520","1173220"," You know I don't want I don't want to talk to you about. "
"1173860","1175900"," I don't want to be having this conversation with you."
"1176280","1180720"," And then see the market just blast down on Monday or something or we have some kind of an unknown"
"1180720","1181640"," macro event."
"1182840","1186100"," And you say something to me like well we would we didn't know that was going to happen. "
"1188760","1192140"," You know there are cheap hedges out there on this market that you can find."
"1192260","1196940"," If you don't know how to find a hedge that's cheap to protect against some kind of event like that."
"1197420","1200320"," Or your investment then you're not taking what you're doing seriously. "
"1200980","1203960"," So the only time I'm going to warn on this on Tesla okay."
"1204600","1206100"," Is that right at this moment right here."
"1206500","1211140"," You can see we squeezed up above previously we rolled back down and waited for this blue line to"
"1211140","1211460"," come up. "
"1212920","1214480"," And we're coming into that area again."
"1214480","1219500"," Does that mean that we does that mean that we don't you know that the drops in significant or not."
"1219620","1224480"," No it just means that you need to start thinking about where do I reenter. "
"1225000","1228320"," Where do I take profit or where do I think about buying again."
"1229300","1231680"," And how do I hedge this long that I'm in."
"1231880","1234600"," A lot of you guys know that we bought way down here right. "
"1237240","1241420"," You know you could probably like take your money and run for 2023 and you'll beat that you'll beat"
"1241420","1242940"," every but every professional out there."
"1242940","1244520"," If you if you just bought Tesla this year."
"1245120","1247300"," You can close your position today and come back next year. "
"1247860","1250520"," And you beat literally beat the entire market more than likely."
"1252000","1255520"," Probably beat 90% of a hedge funds this year."
"1256180","1257620"," Just just with that trade right there. "
"1258600","1259000"," So."
"1261980","1264940"," Protect your protect all the hard work that you did is all I can say on that."
"1265620","1266580"," So if you're a Tesla trader. "
"1267380","1269720"," I want just want you to realize we can go up from here."
"1270220","1273160"," I want you to see though that we're likely going to get a reaction."
"1275300","1277540"," Right you're going to get a reaction right here no matter what. "
"1278100","1281860"," And your next price target above again is two twenty eighty nine on Tesla."
"1282980","1288280"," You've got FOMO stepping in you've got other countries traders and buyers stepping in right now."
"1290900","1294880"," You know all this here is just free money up above all this stuff just free money. "
"1295360","1297300"," If you're not in Tesla right now."
"1297940","1301020"," If you're like I missed the cap I want to get into the FOMO right."
"1302080","1304540"," There are places for you to look to get into the FOMO. "
"1307950","1310050"," You can do that right you're looking for."
"1314000","1317620"," You're looking for some kind of a pullback in here and hold take this higher."
"1318360","1321340"," You put a stop right here if it starts to roll over. "
"1321620","1324920"," You lick your wounds and you wait for the next chance."
"1326440","1330540"," Right starts to come back down here we come back down here test one sixty six."
"1330540","1332180"," You can enter again. "
"1333060","1337360"," If we break below you take your you take your licks right so now you're like down a dollar or"
"1337360","1338980"," something down a dollar over here."
"1339540","1341760"," You're not like buying a top up here."
"1342820","1345260"," At let's say two twenty and then rolling over. "
"1345880","1351480"," You're now you're now like you know you bought two twenty and now you own it at one fifty one"
"1351480","1352660"," or something does that make sense."
"1353540","1357180"," You don't want to be doing that stupid shit you know you're down seventy bucks on."
"1357180","1359260"," On wanting to be a bull. "
"1359840","1366960"," Have patience if you're if you're just getting FOMO here and look for entry into Tesla."
"1369760","1373520"," Does that make sense the probably not what you wanted to hear is Tesla gang this morning huh."
"1376700","1378940"," Probably not wanted what you wanted to hear this morning. "
"1381220","1386680"," And remember that tag above if we break above and consolidate above right where we are right now."
"1386680","1388140"," So I'm going to show it to you right now."
"1388640","1392740"," I'm going to give you some I'm going to give you some some levels put on your own charts at"
"1392740","1392940"," home. "
"1395360","1400800"," We've got a big old line we just tagged it as a matter of fact you guys I posted this"
"1400800","1403120"," shit this yellow line right here I tagged it."
"1403280","1407720"," I posted this this line right here for you we hit it it's done."
"1408400","1411240"," Not done but we tagged it okay. "
"1411820","1416120"," This is the green line little green box right there we did it good job."
"1419130","1423190"," Next target above two twenty ninety six for Tesla."
"1433290","1435810"," That's your next target right there does that happen today. "
"1437250","1441910"," I don't know if it does you know Tesla can be Tesla can be irrational."
"1446800","1449620"," Completely trades are rationally completely trades."
"1451120","1453520"," You know you know what it is I don't need to tell you. "
"1454460","1455840"," There's the tag right there."
"1457600","1458760"," I will say this."
"1460540","1466020"," If we begin to settle in here we start to trade up here this two twenty. "
"1467360","1470900"," You're going to need to wait for some momentum to catch back up."
"1471120","1473940"," I would expect some consolidation down here forward."
"1474280","1476600"," Now this is on a three two day two session chart. "
"1477280","1481140"," This could take a week a month for this to play out."
"1481140","1489320"," I should be doing this on a one hour chart instead."
"1489660","1500780"," This is kind of like not really what you"
"1500780","1504000"," want to be looking at but if we do squeeze up here. "
"1504320","1509240"," Let's say we do I'm still going to expect some consolidation until you get it at the leg down the"
"1509240","1509500"," road."
"1510500","1514880"," I'm going to give you some other key places for Tesla here."
"1519530","1521410"," One seventy nine fifty three. "
"1536100","1537600"," The big boy right here."
"1537960","1538720"," Here's the big one."
"1539280","1543540"," Tesla bulls do not want to give up one fifty one zero six. "
"1555120","1557140"," This is no go for Tesla fans."
"1557320","1558980"," If you're a Tesla fan or a bull or bear."
"1560400","1562620"," You do not want to give this up right here. "
"1565500","1568580"," Any point you give this up right here we break below this."
"1568580","1573640"," Market is back on selling now this number changes over time but for right now."
"1574360","1575420"," This is what you need to know. "
"1575660","1577300"," This is where the this is where the."
"1580540","1582640"," The bad man lives down here okay."
"1583980","1586400"," You do not want this bad boy right here. "
"1587140","1592160"," Now we can we can trade all the way down here and bounce around and continue higher but you do"
"1592160","1594780"," not want to confirm a move lower today."
"1594780","1601280"," And this move this this target changes a little bit every day but basically right now it's a."
"1602760","1604940"," For today it's one fifty one thirty eight."
"1606180","1610920"," You don't want to see that happen you see that happen bad bad news for Tesla bulls. "
"1611600","1615120"," And this is why you put a hedge on right this is why you go yeah if we start heading"
"1615120","1616240"," back down here I'm going to buy."
"1616720","1618100"," I don't know I'm going to buy out June."
"1619560","1621620"," June three thousand puts or something. "
"1622200","1625220"," Right on the spy or you do it on do something on tech."
"1626140","1627960"," Just to protect your investment right."
"1628880","1633260"," If you own the underlying up here you want to be able to at least get some some money I'm"
"1633260","1635920"," not going to tell you to sell calls or sell puts or. "
"1636280","1641660"," None of that shit I don't do any of that shit on on YouTube run into it you guys can"
"1641660","1643900"," decide what you what strategy you want to use."
"1644520","1649520"," I'll never directly short test I've got a thing that I don't I don't do it so."
"1651260","1655860"," But you guys can figure out your own ways to head your positions publicly. "
"1657100","1658140"," For me I don't."
"1659120","1663040"," It's what it's like the only stock that I buy I buy I own and I'm bullish on it all"
"1663040","1663420"," the time."
"1665740","1670620"," Now although I don't tell you to buy tops here I'd usually am the guy that gets screamed at I"
"1670620","1676460"," lose I lost followers a couple years ago or a year or two ago twice I lost a ton of"
"1676460","1677360"," followers because. "
"1678780","1682640"," They wanted me to tell them to buy here and I'm not going to tell you to do that I'm"
"1682640","1688280"," going to tell you to be a strategic bull that you buy dips you're a dip buyer always."
"1689320","1692900"," You're a dip buyer it feels good to be a dip buyer when we're up here."
"1694680","1696500"," Feels great there's nothing like it. "
"1701100","1701960"," You know what I'm saying."
"1710660","1715500"," Question is that the truth here is no so when we're in the close so I just got asked if"
"1715500","1716460"," spies rolling over."
"1716460","1719080"," So when we were closing out yesterday right. "
"1720140","1722080"," If you go back to the live stream from yesterday."
"1723660","1726500"," Someone had said they wanted to short spy."
"1729180","1731500"," And I said the same thing that I'm going to say today. "
"1732480","1734440"," Same thing yesterday that I said today."
"1734840","1737840"," I'm going to say today which I tried to say I've been to it but."
"1738740","1740820"," I was starting to get the live stream going. "
"1741220","1746400"," If we start selling now it's going to go right we're going to start liquidating but we have to"
"1746400","1747600"," break and I said this yesterday."
"1747600","1753320"," I said yesterday I said yeah I was like I was like I wouldn't take this trade right here I"
"1753320","1754960"," was like I would take this part of the trade."
"1755520","1756720"," That's where the money is. "
"1757360","1761980"," And then you have to close it for profit and pick up the trade once we're under with confirmation"
"1761980","1762620"," again."
"1763480","1768040"," And the same thing goes you don't short strength right that's a rule you don't short strength"
"1768040","1768420"," right."
"1769940","1771360"," And the same thing goes here. "
"1773720","1779640"," You can take the trade down to breakthrough right you're looking for some rejection and you're"
"1779640","1780560"," looking for confirmation."
"1781120","1785400"," So you can take the next leg of this below the blue and green line on the one minute chart"
"1785400","1785840"," up here."
"1787060","1789820"," You can take this trade again right here right. "
"1790400","1791580"," And you put your stops above."
"1792400","1796300"," And if you start to squeeze higher you get out you had a chance here actually to get out of"
"1796300","1796580"," a short."
"1797640","1799440"," We trade like this every day right. "
"1800600","1804420"," So even right now the question becomes hey are we rolling over here."
"1805180","1807980"," You know what we talk about on this channel right you get a new high."
"1808680","1810000"," On the on the one minute. "
"1810720","1815000"," Which we just did right you got four seventeen fourteen is two things here first off."
"1815580","1819920"," You got the new high right now and we're trading above the blue line that means we're bullish"
"1819920","1820340"," right."
"1820940","1823600"," You want to trade underneath the blue line to become bearish. "
"1825520","1826680"," See it right here right."
"1828120","1831720"," And even with that you need you can only trade it to this green line."
"1832880","1837200"," You have to close your short or your puts or whatever it is and then you can pick it back"
"1837200","1839560"," up if we get the send down below here. "
"1840560","1844720"," And you have to have stops above that's this is if you're shorting right same thing with along."
"1847220","1850040"," Right I'm going to do the inverse right now for along with you."
"1850040","1857060"," So I'm sitting here right now and I'm like well we tried to short string pair didn't work that"
"1857060","1857940"," stopped out right. "
"1858700","1863900"," And so we're up here trading up high right now so I'm going to take the bullish perspective here."
"1864860","1870280"," We came all the way up here to close this gap we're likely going to close this gap right likely."
"1872960","1877620"," Not guaranteed maybe maybe they fake us out and we do it tomorrow okay you can have that viewpoint"
"1877620","1878240"," as well. "
"1879000","1881940"," But as let's say we set this champ as a bull right."
"1883420","1885800"," Let's let's look at setting this trade up as a bull."
"1886200","1890820"," We know that we've got some resistance on Tesla right now right we know we're heading into some"
"1890820","1893200"," resistance on Tesla because I just looked it up on Tesla. "
"1895060","1898760"," I'm going to check on the spy spies spies spies a little hot right now."
"1903570","1905970"," We got the new high though that's bullish right."
"1906790","1908590"," So I'm going to snap a line right here. "
"1913470","1913950"," Right."
"1915110","1921150"," Starting to roll roll underneath the one minute and I got this blue this white this green line"
"1921150","1923530"," coming up and I'm going to look to buy a dip down here."
"1924410","1929030"," Right so just like these stops above I'm going to put stops down below the green line. "
"1930170","1932350"," I'm going to do a buy down here."
"1933190","1941640"," I'm going to look to buy this white line right here."
"1942660","1943280"," See it. "
"1944860","1946340"," I'm going to look to buy this white line."
"1949470","1951850"," That's me right I'm looking to buy that white line."
"1952810","1962650"," I've got add or not it's all it's all in your preference right now for me this is what I'll"
"1962650","1962990"," do right. "
"1964450","1967250"," So if I'm still bullish here this is what I'm going to do right here."
"1969520","1973460"," Now you might be like yeah I'm buying right here in this blue line you might be like yeah I'm"
"1973460","1974800"," waiting for the green line to buy."
"1974800","1979560"," Sometimes you never come back on the on the green line on on strength right you decide what you're"
"1979560","1983320"," buying and how you're managing your trade and you're going to have a price target above if you're"
"1983320","1987080"," going to take this trade same on the same going this way and same down here right. "
"1987540","1991340"," You can you can turn this chart upside down and the same trade applies."
"1993720","1997740"," Right you could get rid of adding and just say I only buy the green line."
"1998440","2003360"," That's fair enough that's the risk tolerance you want to take that's the risk tolerance you want to"
"2003360","2003560"," take. "
"2005820","2009680"," Right I'm looking at this setup right now and truly just by trading every day."
"2010240","2014020"," I'm like yeah they might try to we had this giant squeeze up."
"2014600","2021160"," They might try to they might try to do a liquidation break here a little quick bloodbath down here. "
"2022780","2025940"," Right if I can get this buy down here to be awesome."
"2026780","2031960"," They give away half this move right here this big squeeze comes back dealers don't want to pay"
"2031960","2032380"," anymore."
"2033060","2035860"," Buyers are probably in for pennies down here. "
"2036720","2039400"," So you know we're probably going to pull back a little bit here."
"2044470","2048110"," So I'm going to look for an entry in here right now I've been blabbing so I didn't buy this"
"2048110","2048550"," right here."
"2049250","2051530"," But if I let's pretend I had bought right here. "
"2052170","2054469"," I'm probably going to add to a position down here."
"2056050","2059770"," And I'm going to have a price target above right price right above four twenty one."
"2060250","2061750"," This is my thesis right. "
"2062730","2065070"," My thesis can be wrong it's been wrong in the past."
"2065949","2069969"," But my thesis is that we're going to tag this in an attempt here."
"2070510","2077850"," I'm going to look back in time for previous highs gap bills previous lows in case it fails. "
"2079050","2083330"," Maybe some some previous highs in pre market some previous highs in the overnight."
"2084310","2088489"," Previous highs if I have to go back a month or three months if we haven't been here in a"
"2088489","2088750"," while."
"2089929","2091610"," Same thing on the way down right. "
"2092170","2094889"," Looking for gap bills test was burning off the mic."
"2095210","2100470"," Let's start looking back on of twenty twenty right we had gap bills that way down ninety five sixty"
"2100470","2101530"," five forty six."
"2101890","2105630"," All those places down below same thing applies on the upside here. "
"2108300","2110540"," I'll be taking a trade with you this morning just give me a minute."
"2110800","2111900"," Let me set this up."
"2112640","2115200"," I was a little emotional this morning because. "
"2116980","2119040"," Some of you probably understand out there."
"2119040","2125020"," How the psychology of trading and investing is brutal."
"2126220","2130940"," On bottoms any kind of bottom if it's trading if it's a tradeable bottom it's brutal. "
"2131680","2136360"," It is a completely different experience than when you're buying."
"2138200","2142020"," In a FOMO situation when you're like yeah man Tesla's up to."
"2142020","2145040"," Two hundred let's buy some calls or who. "
"2145540","2152020"," Let's buy some Tesla stock it's a completely different experience mentally I don't know why that"
"2152020","2152320"," is."
"2154800","2160200"," You're like instant gratification that you feel good buying at two hundred bucks is completely"
"2160200","2161380"," different than."
"2162240","2167440"," When you're in the depths of hell and the news is horrible and social media is horrible and. "
"2168120","2174840"," There's fucking astroturfing on Reddit there's you know everything is just pure negative."
"2175740","2182380"," Like this cacophony of and you're like the only person going to yourself I am going to buy this"
"2182380","2182920"," right now."
"2183560","2186600"," And you're going against literally the entire world. "
"2188020","2194820"," And so when you get to this point right here you see the exuberance everywhere and it's a."
"2196020","2200400"," It's just a different thing it's such a hard thing to buy bottoms it's a hard thing to buy dips."
"2201500","2203220"," And when they pay off."
"2205400","2211940"," It's just like really weird emotional dump like an emotion dump or like stress dump or some kind. "
"2212540","2217440"," And of course through the entire thing what you're doing is you're trying not trying what you're"
"2217440","2218560"," maintaining your composure."
"2219300","2225940"," You are constantly constantly trying to try to punch holes in your plan."
"2228370","2234210"," You're constantly trying to find where did they fuck up on a bad day you have a bad day where"
"2234210","2237350"," we go down one day we bleed off we look for more support lower. "
"2238030","2240850"," Those things can rattle rattle you right you're like."
"2241770","2247490"," Is my thesis right my thesis not right is it where the holes in my thesis where where did I"
"2247490","2249510"," go wrong is it going to go wrong am I going to."
"2249870","2254790"," You know wake up tomorrow morning and be you know blow my account out or something like that you"
"2254790","2256330"," know that's all real stuff people deal with. "
"2256670","2263510"," And have to manage and of course you're like on this high high wire string of tension making sure"
"2263510","2268930"," that you're right and I don't know about you but for me I missed the trade already."
"2270730","2277830"," For me at least the past few months you know yet because you know if you're wrong."
"2277830","2284890"," Then you have to go back and find out where you made a major miscalculation. "
"2287910","2294910"," And you know you don't want to be making major miscalculations you want to be kind of close."
"2298960","2304920"," And if you are wrong that you have a way to like unfuck yourself to be honest"
"2319230","2324710"," with you."
"2324710","2324890"," You know. "
"2327150","2329070"," Four seventeen eighteen."
"2341580","2343500"," I remember your comments at this morning."
"2344160","2345840"," I'm like a child right now. "
"2347420","2351220"," My kids are my wife saw me they'd be like what is wrong with you."
"2353260","2356040"," Probably going to have to delete this video later this morning."
"2359200","2360920"," Hold on a second we're going to call coming in. "
"2363400","2363860"," Hello."
"2370260","2371160"," Oh yeah dude."
"2491740","2497300"," All right so I want you to be careful here on spy picking a rollover. "
"2498540","2500880"," I'm going to talk to you about Tesla one more time okay."
"2504300","2508960"," I want to talk about Tesla I'm going to show you something here okay see the rejection above."
"2512400","2514260"," I just want to show you something here okay. "
"2514260","2516160"," I'm going to show you two setups okay."
"2517700","2524540"," You want to be watching now of Tesla."
"2526400","2528600"," I'm going to do this correctly here. "
"2531870","2535630"," The velocity can come up right here on the one minute and five minute."
"2536270","2539350"," We can take this trade higher okay if price follows this."
"2540750","2544030"," But the probability of that happening is low. "
"2544030","2553350"," So I want you to hedge yourself in here take profit and look for some kind of a retest of"
"2553350","2554430"," the hourly down below."
"2556210","2560070"," We're likely going to come down and at least test this 180 120."
"2561690","2566370"," To get some velocity to meet up with the one in the hourly to get higher. "
"2567970","2571110"," So right now this is that 180 we may not get that low."
"2571930","2574090"," We're going to take a look at it real quick okay."
"2575070","2576070"," If you're a Tesla bull. "
"2576790","2585550"," I don't know why this isn't showing over here it is."
"2586290","2596050"," I don't know why this is getting"
"2596050","2596430"," wonky."
"2615960","2622200"," You're a Tesla bull right now it's time to take your money and run. "
"2623200","2624060"," Or hedge your position."
"2626080","2631060"," You're either going to re-enter a trade here as an attempt or you're going to wait for it to"
"2631060","2631800"," break above."
"2632240","2632880"," As we said earlier. "
"2633780","2635380"," For your next leg higher at 220."
"2636240","2637800"," This is not the place you mess around."
"2638380","2640680"," This is what Mr. Yen would say don't diddle here. "
"2641060","2641480"," Does that make sense."
"2642400","2642940"," You diddle above."
"2644420","2647580"," Or you come back in to take the trade once more. "
"2647780","2648240"," Does that make sense."
"2649060","2650160"," You would take profit here."
"2652040","2654020"," And then re-enter again above here. "
"2654540","2656480"," Now you can stay long here with the underlying."
"2657400","2660440"," Just know that you need to have some protection on where we are currently."
"2662860","2664700"," Understand if you're if you're a Tesla bull. "
"2665900","2668720"," If you're just like yeah I don't care if we come down cap no big deal."
"2668820","2669800"," If you're in calls and stuff."
"2670400","2670960"," If you're in spreads. "
"2671860","2673200"," Now is the time to take the money and run."
"2674220","2675860"," If you're in any kind of options structure."
"2676480","2678740"," And then you're going to be looking for at least buying down below. "
"2680080","2682680"," Or picking that call trade back up above here."
"2682820","2684240"," Does that make sense."
"2692680","2695680"," So James Roland is coming in just to confirm what I had said earlier. "
"2697060","2702580"," And it was critical that we got his his expertise to make sure we got this right."
"2711040","2711520"," Alright."
"2712740","2715860"," Now let's look at spy and then go back to spy real quick. "
"2717900","2719300"," Look at that beast mode."
"2720640","2722060"," Beast mode on spy."
"2723120","2724080"," Beast mode. "
"2731060","2731660"," Alright."
"2732300","2733780"," So we got the Tesla out of the way."
"2734400","2735560"," There should be no Tesla. "
"2736140","2739920"," No no Tesla bull out there that doesn't understand the process here."
"2744420","2747260"," Do any Tesla bulls have any questions out there."
"2751060","2753160"," Does any Tesla bull have any questions. "
"2754720","2756280"," Do do do do."
"2756720","2757980"," Yeah, and we'll do a stream tomorrow."
"2759100","2759700"," Definitely. "
"2762120","2767200"," A lot of lobsters asking is there a gap down on Tesla around 147 155 ish."
"2769080","2770880"," Gaps can and can't be filled."
"2771140","2771900"," Sometimes they are filled. "
"2772120","2773100"," Sometimes they're left behind."
"2773780","2776520"," You'll always hear like there's if you're going to talk about gaps."
"2777320","2778420"," Gaps can be left behind. "
"2779260","2780800"," If they do get left behind."
"2781220","2784220"," The notion is that they'll eventually come back to film at some point."
"2785720","2787720"," So it's not really the best. "
"2789600","2795500"," Tool to be I mean it works on an intraday and SPX oftentimes you'll see gaps get build or partially"
"2795500","2797640"," build, but there's no guarantee of it."
"2799260","2801840"," They're really seeking out supply and demand."
"2802340","2807540"," You can use it as like a third or fourth indicator, but you get it's really hard to be like. "
"2808460","2812720"," We're definitely going to fill that gap if you say that and we don't go fill that gap and just"
"2812720","2813360"," start running."
"2814500","2817820"," It's like it's not a tool that you can guarantee it's going to happen."
"2818080","2824200"," You'll oftentimes see it on intraday like SPX by stuff like not SPX but spy. "
"2827350","2829770"," But there's no hard and fast rule on filling gaps."
"2830610","2833550"," When we're in bull markets, we leave gaps behind."
"2834410","2837950"," I mean for months months and months and months and months sometimes. "
"2843480","2850660"," All right, so if you had stops down here and we're now trading back above, you're going to raise"
"2850660","2852660"," your stops here to the green line, right?"
"2853460","2855720"," You should always be raising stops, right?"
"2855800","2860400"," If you had bought down here at all, you're going to raise your stops up and manage your risk."
"2860400","2863780"," You still have the price target above of four twenty four twenty one."
"2864300","2868060"," Make sure that you're managing yourself so you're always keeping your money. "
"2868340","2870600"," You should always have an options chain open too."
"2870600","2872660"," You shouldn't have Robinhood open."
"2873060","2877420"," You should be looking at an options chain so that you can see the interest on the option that"
"2877420","2877960"," you're in. "
"2878820","2883320"," You want to see if the algorithms are getting out of your option, getting into your option, getting"
"2883320","2885400"," into the options below you, above you."
"2885620","2886900"," Are they on the same side of you?"
"2887520","2888920"," Are they on the opposite side of you?"
"2889780","2895680"," You want to also be looking at the flow or the range of price as we go up or down"
"2895680","2896180"," on the market."
"2896180","2900660"," If you're like, hey, I'm interested right now in four eighteen C's. "
"2901220","2906400"," Or four eighteen's, like you'll see a price on them as the day goes on."
"2907060","2912100"," If we start at nine a.m. or nine thirty, you're going to have less data burn than you are"
"2912100","2914680"," as we hit the one o'clock hour, the three o'clock hour."
"2916440","2916920"," Right?"
"2917680","2925300"," So you want to be, you want to be watching the option, the interest, the option price, or the IV. "
"2936700","2941420"," And let's say we, let's say we trade below the option you're looking at and you want to be looking"
"2941420","2941820"," at calls."
"2942040","2946100"," You're like, I'm looking at the, let's hear a burning and you're looking at four eighteen's."
"2946480","2951240"," You might have to switch from that, that strike to a higher strike and start watching the price"
"2951240","2953680"," action on that specific option. "
"2953860","2956860"," You'll be like, oh yeah, four eighteen's."
"2957380","2958560"," Everybody's in at twenty cents."
"2959680","2961500"," You'll see it pump up to eighty cents. "
"2962260","2964020"," Then it'll come back down to thirty cents."
"2964020","2965580"," Then it'll pump up to eighty cents."
"2965920","2967680"," Then it'll come down to forty cents. "
"2968560","2969740"," Pump up to ninety cents."
"2969980","2972260"," Come up to forty five cents down to forty five cents."
"2973300","2978980"," And you'll see, I know where the, where the bottom range in this option is as we're making a"
"2978980","2979700"," directional move. "
"2981200","2990280"," So you're, if you're, I can't really visualize this, uh, tasty you can, but if you have the life of"
"2990280","2992820"," an option, especially a zero date, it's going to zero."
"2994220","2998080"," By end of day, you can actually see the price movement."
"2998980","3003620"," You should be able to visualize this in your mind as the day wears on. "
"3004540","3007480"," So you can be like, yeah, I don't want to buy in this zero date here."
"3007600","3012580"," Even if, even if the price, the price of the underlying is going up, the option is still going"
"3012580","3013220"," down, right?"
"3013980","3015020"," So it's counterintuitive."
"3016620","3022220"," The price of the option, even though the price of the product is going up is coming down"
"3022220","3022680"," eventually. "
"3022680","3026740"," So you want to be buying like here, here, here."
"3026900","3027480"," Does that make sense?"
"3029300","3030980"," Well, that should be your thought process."
"3031220","3035380"," Sometimes it'll blast way up here, the option with price. "
"3036880","3042280"," So if you buy here, you'll get that big giant squeeze out of the, out of the, uh, trend down"
"3042280","3043780"," on that option."
"3055140","3059380"," We'll take a look at Apple, the driver of the market right now."
"3059380","3062580"," We're going to take a look at Apple and Amazon, particularly of both. "
"3063940","3069000"," If Tesla starts to cool off a little bit, let's take a look at Amazon and Apple and see what"
"3069000","3069480"," they're doing."
"3076990","3077870"," Here's Amazon."
"3079570","3080390"," Crazy town. "
"3082010","3088710"," If you want to see Spy go up, you want to see 11094 hold on Amazon."
"3090090","3100060"," If we look at Apple, you want to see 149 "
"3100060","3101380","-44 hold."
"3103640","3106400"," Get out, bullish Apple is monster bullish. "
"3108280","3109360"," Monster bullish."
"3112930","3113150"," Cranking."
"3114410","3119530"," If you want to buy an Apple, I'd love to buy 145-97. "
"3121370","3122470"," Love to buy that."
"3123370","3124350"," Love to buy 144-62."
"3128610","3130290"," Love to buy 139-65. "
"3140460","3141840"," Raise your stops here."
"3143180","3145000"," You don't want to get caught in a rollover, right?"
"3145220","3146500"," You're in a long call here."
"3147300","3148280"," You don't get caught in this. "
"3151890","3153610"," Raise your stops on your calls."
"3157370","3160890"," If you're still bullish here, we bleed down and tag this once."
"3161430","3163290"," You can at least re-enter for the trade hire. "
"3164350","3170510"," If this doesn't blast off for you immediately, take your money and run and re-enter down below."
"3176550","3181130"," You should never be giving money back to the house, ever, or try not to."
"3182030","3183970"," Of course, yesterday I'm breaking all my rules. "
"3185190","3188790"," I was looking at some of those options into the close yesterday."
"3191090","3192770"," We were trading earlier in the day."
"3193230","3195590"," My price of those options were stupid. "
"3198170","3201170"," We're going to take a look around the rest of the market right now and see if anything's looking"
"3201170","3201630"," toppy."
"3204980","3206200"," Looking toppy, isn't it?"
"3206460","3209120"," They're going to trap you into thinking we're going to close that gap."
"3209860","3211420"," Lock your ass in into the weekend. "
"3214810","3216230"," Get caps above and below."
"3218070","3219390"," Look at HYG."
"3220550","3221770"," Just Boston it right now. "
"3223170","3224570"," The HYG just climbed a mountain."
"3228390","3229130"," Look at that."
"3229610","3229930"," Beast Mode. "
"3231770","3232630"," Beast Mode."
"3236690","3237890"," Just look at that."
"3238390","3238750"," Slam. "
"3249360","3250700"," We've been having to do this."
"3253020","3254280"," Taking the mountain, right?"
"3259340","3259680"," Junk bonds."
"3261660","3262460"," High risk. "
"3264000","3266220"," High yield high risk growth bonds."
"3267400","3269040"," Crap, but not junk bonds, but they're junk."
"3275550","3277030"," Previous high right here. "
"3277030","3278550"," Bears want to hold this above."
"3283720","3285040"," Bulls want to hold this."
"3290460","3291360"," Beast Mode. "
"3297670","3298990"," Straight Beast Mode."
"3302250","3304390"," We're going to also look at something else here."
"3304490","3305950"," Just look at that baby. "
"3306570","3314570"," We're going to snap a line right here."
"3314630","3316410"," This is a critical place I want you to see."
"3318430","3322550"," 77.53. HYG. "
"3325490","3335280"," If bears don't defend 77.53. Let's call it 77 "
"3335280","3337300",".50. If bears don't defend that."
"3338320","3339180"," It's on baby."
"3341320","3342600"," You can see it right. "
"3343860","3345720"," You know bears are waiting up here."
"3347120","3349720"," We sold this right here right in May."
"3352180","3354400"," Sold this right here in August. "
"3356420","3358000"," Sold this right here right?"
"3360760","3363740"," We said hell no we're not going down there."
"3365380","3367600"," Next logical test is right here right?"
"3367800","3372020"," 77.50. Right where we are right now."
"3372120","3375340"," They're going to want to tee off on this in blood bath bath. "
"3375620","3377040"," You see this on HYG."
"3380890","3384350"," You break above this and hold this and start lagging it up higher."
"3386170","3387690"," We're going back to April. "
"3395660","3396140"," Dixie."
"3398180","3399860"," We're going to look at Dixie real quick."
"3400080","3402140"," See this buy on Dixie right here?"
"3402880","3404000"," Why is this important?"
"3404300","3405880"," Why are we seeing a green bar in Dixie?"
"3406100","3406480"," You know why?"
"3407360","3410260"," Does anyone out there know why you're seeing this buy on Dixie?"
"3410680","3411680"," Because I'll tell you why. "
"3416160","3417180"," Anybody know why?"
"3421710","3424730"," You can click this box here and why I can't click this box."
"3429150","3431270"," Got a problem with this shit right now."
"3431290","3431830"," I don't know why. "
"3434530","3435090"," Okay."
"3444290","3446630"," This is an inverse equities right?"
"3447030","3449890"," This is the last hope for bears."
"3451970","3453770"," Even if they get a relief today. "
"3454750","3456570"," This blue line comes back down."
"3456730","3457510"," This is a daily right?"
"3459010","3461650"," If we reverse here you see that reversal candle."
"3462670","3464550"," But this reverse is back down. "
"3465610","3470250"," When you're talking about an explosion in equities."
"3471910","3474710"," So you want to be watching this closely and carefully."
"3475690","3477210"," We're watching Dixie up here. "
"3478130","3479470"," You see this reversal candle?"
"3480210","3482690"," You got some pretty big buyers down here today."
"3484650","3486010"," See what they teed off up here."
"3486190","3491010"," 102.62. On a daily you need to defend as a bull. "
"3492950","3494610"," 102.44 right now."
"3497050","3498810"," This is where the next bull leg is."
"3504240","3504780"," Wow. "
"3505420","3507320"," I can't believe I'm seeing this right now."
"3510620","3514680"," This would probably take us down to three or no."
"3514880","3515600"," It might be higher now. "
"3515760","3516920"," Like 396 or something."
"3517940","3522480"," If Dixie came up and retested this zone above."
"3522820","3524020"," But this is where sellers are man. "
"3524020","3528580"," And then maybe next leg like higher on spies."
"3528880","3530460"," So spies getting a little crispy here."
"3531080","3532140"," Spies getting toppy. "
"3532480","3533600"," Tesla's getting toppy."
"3537090","3538170"," Tesla's getting to that."
"3538470","3539950"," Is this the top or not phase?"
"3541230","3542110"," See right here?"
"3543570","3545050"," Getting a little toppy right?"
"3548330","3551470"," You've got Dixie telling you a different story right now. "
"3552870","3554950"," I'm probably going to look at the put side right now."
"3555910","3561390"," You got Tesla tell or spy telling you a different story than Dixie right now."
"3561410","3563130"," So let's look at Dixie on a daily chart. "
"3563630","3564590"," You see this right here?"
"3565250","3566790"," This is a daily chart in Dixie."
"3567210","3569110"," See it squeeze and higher right now."
"3571470","3574890"," 9 o'clock this morning trying to buy Dixie. "
"3575250","3577230"," Remember yesterday in stream when I said Dixie."
"3578170","3579630"," I don't trust it right now."
"3581410","3585250"," And I think Joe Harper and I were talking about Dixie and I was like, I don't trust it right"
"3585250","3585510"," now. "
"3586250","3590130"," Got Dixie's blasting up here trying to hold its pants."
"3590750","3592870"," This is like a move by Dixie."
"3593110","3597510"," Actually, this actually looks like Dixie's in death throes of collapsing right now. "
"3598270","3599030"," To be honest with you."
"3602760","3604520"," Dixie's like just begging and hoping."
"3606900","3608140"," Yeah, you see right here?"
"3609520","3614600"," Dixie's basically this isn't this is actually bullish on markets believe it or not. "
"3618540","3622820"," Dixie's like clawing itself up trying to hold on."
"3624680","3628640"," Because if it doesn't, it's like you try to imagine you're hanging up the side of a cliff right"
"3628640","3628960"," now."
"3629540","3631100"," And I just pushed you over the cliff. "
"3631720","3636140"," And you were able to hold on with one more hand."
"3636300","3637860"," You got your hand over the cliff right here."
"3638980","3640500"," And I think you're dead and you're not. "
"3641460","3643340"," You're just like hanging out down here."
"3644220","3645500"," And you're pretty pissed off."
"3647000","3647420"," You're angry. "
"3649320","3651080"," And you're like hanging out down here."
"3651840","3657620"," And you're like those goddamn Euro trash and goddamn bulls."
"3658620","3661780"," And you're just trying to like claw your way back up here. "
"3662100","3664260"," And you've got bulls just standing up here like."
"3665520","3669020"," Should we throw them down to the depths of hell or should we let them climb back up."
"3673100","3675020"," Because if they can't hold this. "
"3677500","3679920"," The market's going to explode higher now."
"3679960","3683600"," I think they hold this for now but you know this is not a good look for."
"3685280","3686800"," For equity bears overall. "
"3691450","3694450"," Not a good look for equity bears overall I'll say."
"3695590","3697590"," I'm going to start looking at the put side right now."
"3698270","3699870"," And let's look at some. "
"3701090","3702630"," Let's get the spy real quick again."
"3705080","3707360"," Now we can't confirm a top right now in spy."
"3707360","3711680"," But we're going to at least look for a target down below. "
"3721460","3724920"," All right so we got four fifteen sixty nine."
"3726220","3728740"," And four nine oh four."
"3730620","3734100"," Right so you have four fifteen seventy three sorry my bad. "
"3738150","3739690"," Which is right where we are right."
"3740250","3741650"," We're going to draw a little target down here."
"3750830","3751790"," Four oh. "
"3752870","3755050"," Four oh eight ninety seven I apologize."
"3762240","3763120"," Right at pivot."
"3763940","3765460"," Right down here. "
"3775960","3777220"," Bulls must hold that."
"3780160","3781740"," There's our price target down below."
"3782000","3782760"," Bulls don't hold it. "
"3803760","3807000"," If you want to know where the trade is as a bear it's underneath here."
"3810800","3812440"," That's the meat of the trade right there."
"3817930","3821510"," If you wanted to take puts here you put stops above. "
"3823270","3826430"," Right you buy your buy your puts put your stops up here."
"3827390","3832470"," Or you can put you can add here at four seventeen fourteen and then put your stops above it."
"3838430","3840430"," Stops and then do an ad. "
"3852990","3853850"," Hold on here."
"3856470","3857430"," Same thing right."
"3857910","3859490"," Same thing as on the bull side. "
"3860130","3861430"," That would be your bear side."
"3861430","3867070"," Personally I would like to see a break below the green line before I buy."
"3867930","3872110"," So I would be buying puts down here. "
"3873090","3877450"," I put my ad here and I'd be hoping that price goes first goes below."
"3878850","3880930"," Tags and starts to make it way down."
"3881010","3883450"," I'll have the trade set up and then I would add puts right here. "
"3884310","3887230"," And hopefully I can take this trip down lower."
"3888270","3889470"," That's how I would trade it."
"3900820","3902880"," Or else you get caught in this shit down here. "
"3905620","3907140"," Where they squeeze is higher."
"3907700","3908760"," Close that gap above."
"3917280","3918920"," I'm a bear in the majority of markets now. "
"3920940","3922600"," I've been so patient all morning."
"3923560","3925620"," Yeah as a bull that's what I want to buy."
"3925820","3927140"," I do want to buy this down here. "
"3927520","3928500"," If I had a chat choice."
"3929880","3931600"," I would feel more confident buying this."
"3934880","3937140"," But this is an irrational exuberance right. "
"3937140","3941240"," We know that FOMO steps in and they try to run the train right."
"3941460","3941880"," They don't care."
"3950320","3951220"," Do I do portraits?"
"3953260","3954460"," Hell yeah I do portraits. "
"3955980","3958620"," Hell yeah try to make it as simple as possible for people."
"3960960","3964960"," Without a doubt I try to do only put the live chat on so I can see you guys are"
"3964960","3965920"," commenting right now."
"3969480","3971260"," Alright now I'm going to read the chat right now. "
"3971260","3974280"," You guys have basically what my thoughts are in Tesla."
"3974620","3975880"," You have my thoughts on spy."
"3979040","3985920"," If you're if you missed all of this trade on spy you're looking for two places to buy. "
"3986240","3989940"," First one I told you was 409.04 somewhere down in here."
"3991200","3994640"," The best place to be by would be closer to like 397, 398."
"4003480","4005820"," And there's one more thing I'm going to show you guys right now. "
"4005820","4006540"," You guys want to see some cool."
"4007900","4008960"," I'll show you guys some cool."
"4009080","4009820"," You guys want to see some cool. "
"4013050","4020830"," You want to know my thoughts on this if I can do this if I can show you this real"
"4020830","4021050"," quick."
"4021710","4022630"," My thoughts on the fed."
"4026360","4027360"," What the fed wants. "
"4050240","4054880"," I can be wrong on this but even if we are wrong we'll know it."
"4079730","4081890"," You guys want to see it or no."
"4082830","4084190"," I'll show you if you want to see it. "
"4087090","4091530"," The rational exuberance baby who we're about to take a large shit."
"4091850","4092150"," I agree."
"4092470","4092990"," I think we are. "
"4094570","4095630"," I think we're going to take a lot."
"4095810","4096830"," I hope that we do."
"4097149","4098109"," I don't want us to be. "
"4098470","4099529"," I hate when we do this stuff."
"4099670","4100490"," We still start squeezing."
"4102810","4106750"," I don't like trading big squeeze like squeeze squeeze squeeze. "
"4107770","4109430"," This is more than likely buying."
"4110109","4111950"," You got like phone calls being made."
"4112090","4113170"," I don't care what the price is. "
"4115229","4116450"," You guys I'm going to show you."
"4116970","4117830"," You guys want to see."
"4118170","4118350"," Okay. "
"4122500","4123180"," All right cool."
"4123359","4123800"," I'll show you guys."
"4132930","4135210"," Give me a second here and I'll line it up for you. "
"4139890","4141750"," So here's kind of like the thought process."
"4142010","4142170"," Okay."
"4162290","4163270"," Let's go way back. "
"4164189","4165370"," You guys want to go way back."
"4167490","4168350"," It's not way back."
"4168470","4171609"," But I know you I know you get the doom Michael Burries out there and stuff. "
"4175529","4180050"," I want you to see this art."
"4180330","4181729"," Remember this orange line down here."
"4181810","4182029"," Okay. "
"4182750","4185670"," Get these major major bottoms in this orange line."
"4186090","4186330"," Right."
"4186450","4187069"," Pretty pretty good. "
"4187149","4187350"," Right."
"4187770","4188290"," Blue line."
"4188890","4190050"," All that all the way up. "
"4190170","4190310"," Right."
"4191229","4192850"," Orange in the bottom blue in the top."
"4193029","4193149"," Right. "
"4195310","4197070"," Orange in the bottom blue in the top."
"4197210","4197390"," Right."
"4197570","4198230"," They all make sense. "
"4199190","4201470"," Orange in the bottom blue on the top."
"4201670","4201790"," Right."
"4202390","4203370"," But way back. "
"4204010","4204130"," Right."
"4204390","4205630"," Orange in the bottom blue in the top."
"4205790","4206390"," Break through the blue. "
"4206810","4207070"," Come down."
"4207270","4207770"," Test the arms."
"4208550","4209190"," Fairly simple. "
"4213090","4213570"," Basic."
"4214650","4215850"," Not rocket science."
"4216530","4217490"," Pretty easy to figure out. "
"4219290","4220690"," Every once in a while."
"4221910","4224830"," That old blue line comes down and we trade under it."
"4225970","4227170"," We trade under it. "
"4227270","4227330"," Right."
"4227330","4228110"," This is 2000."
"4229590","4231110"," This is a GFC right here. "
"4231250","4232170"," Tech boom."
"4232730","4234110"," A GFC right here."
"4234230","4234330"," Boom. "
"4234910","4234930"," Right."
"4235550","4238150"," Now you know that the Fed knows about this shit."
"4238290","4238390"," Right. "
"4241370","4243030"," Blue crosses over the orange."
"4243430","4244710"," Blue crosses over the orange."
"4250550","4252230"," Blue didn't cross over the orange. "
"4252470","4252670"," Did it."
"4255720","4257020"," They know about this shit."
"4258800","4259620"," This is momentum. "
"4260200","4260240"," Okay."
"4260240","4262520"," And as time builds momentum catches up."
"4262760","4262800"," Right. "
"4262980","4264260"," You trade up and above a momentum."
"4264360","4267120"," You'll eventually come back down and retest it."
"4267220","4267840"," Same thing here. "
"4268000","4268080"," Right."
"4268740","4270320"," Like you stretch the market."
"4270320","4271740"," We come back down to it. "
"4271820","4271940"," Right."
"4273220","4274120"," Stretch the market."
"4274120","4275340"," We come back down to it. "
"4276160","4277940"," There's also a time involved in this."
"4277940","4278260"," Right."
"4279000","4283340"," So we stretch away with momentum from the orange line. "
"4284260","4285200"," Come back down."
"4285280","4286060"," Test the blue line."
"4286420","4286960"," Pretty simple. "
"4288260","4290740"," Now you get the Fed trying to buy time in here."
"4292120","4294960"," So you've got the Fed saying we're going to do this and we're going to do that and we're going"
"4294960","4295900"," to do this and we're going to do that."
"4297320","4299780"," Meanwhile, there's some guy out there where the clockity goes. "
"4299960","4300200"," Click."
"4302320","4302680"," Right."
"4302840","4303060"," He goes. "
"4303220","4303400"," Okay."
"4303760","4305000"," We'll give you some time to do your thing."
"4305980","4307940"," Now you as a market participant, you think. "
"4308600","4309660"," Well, the Fed's working."
"4310580","4314620"," As long as they make you believe that they're working, they are."
"4314620","4317260"," In reality, they're just buying time. "
"4318020","4319560"," They're not actually having much impact."
"4319800","4321060"," There's a natural cycle to businesses."
"4321840","4324760"," There's a natural cycle to failure in companies that are committing fraud. "
"4325040","4328900"," There's a natural cycle to growth and expansion and contraction in a company's life."
"4330840","4335480"," I know they were dumping a bunch of money and stuff into the market, but the truth is they were"
"4335480","4336620"," trying to buy time and they did."
"4337220","4338360"," They bought time. "
"4340040","4341700"," Now, as we came down here, right?"
"4342100","4343280"," I want you to remember this back here."
"4344680","4346340"," Blue above orange blow."
"4346620","4347800"," Blue breaks below the orange. "
"4348160","4349060"," It's really bad, right?"
"4349680","4350400"," Not so bad."
"4350560","4354360"," I knew he thought it was bad in 2019, but the Fed stepped in and said, oh, fuck you."
"4354400","4355260"," No, we're not doing that. "
"4355760","4357500"," We're not crossing the blue line underneath."
"4360860","4361300"," Right."
"4362700","4365320"," As soon as that blue line started coming down, they got panicky. "
"4366320","4366600"," Boom."
"4366980","4367280"," Fed pivot."
"4368660","4370300"," Kept as a blow above the blue line. "
"4370300","4371380"," That's the fraud, right?"
"4372100","4372540"," Remember the fraud?"
"4374260","4375020"," See the fraud?"
"4375020","4377080"," Do you see the fraud?"
"4378380","4382560"," Hoping that you do because that blue line was coming down here and they knew."
"4382820","4389680"," Someone said, yep, the blue line's going to cross and we're going to have another 2000 or 2008."
"4391820","4392820"," Is that simple?"
"4393100","4393840"," Well, it's not a blue line. "
"4393960","4403920"," It's actually something I can't tell you about, but the key here is guess where we are."
"4405820","4406140"," Shocker."
"4408500","4411180"," We're right back to that blue line coming down. "
"4412640","4414280"," See that blue line coming down?"
"4416060","4418040"," See that orange line right there?"
"4418580","4419240"," That blue line."
"4420180","4421620"," And what's the Fed doing?"
"4423220","4424700"," Fed's having a meeting somewhere."
"4426820","4429700"," They're banging hookers in Davos or some shit. "
"4429700","4434660"," And they're like, look, are you ready to crash the market right now?"
"4435020","4441630"," Because if we do it, if we come out and speak next week, we're right at that point where we"
"4441630","4442990"," bought the time that we needed."
"4445410","4450170"," And we're at that point where we're going to dump it before we need more time."
"4451110","4453570"," We know that unemployment is not where it needs to be, right?"
"4453750","4456190"," We haven't had demand destruction where we need it to be. "
"4456290","4458570"," We haven't seen inflation come down to where we needed to be."
"4459710","4460630"," Time to cut rates."
"4461710","4462630"," Time to dump it. "
"4463510","4465750"," You got Mike Wilson saying last leg right now."
"4465750","4471270"," You got Mike Barry out there that knows this and says, well, they're either going to dump it or"
"4471270","4472070"," they're going to buy time."
"4472190","4472670"," What are they doing?"
"4473930","4476310"," And that's what that's what you got from J Pal yesterday. "
"4476310","4477810"," I'm going to tell you what J Pal wants."
"4478790","4480450"," You see this orange line right here?"
"4481050","4486720"," You see this blue line to that orange line right there?"
"4488080","4489320"," They want to put space."
"4492360","4494180"," Between these two lines right here. "
"4495020","4495840"," For now."
"4496700","4498540"," So that when they are ready to dump it."
"4499560","4501280"," They'll start getting more hawkish. "
"4502040","4504240"," Then we're down back here by this blue line."
"4504740","4505640"," Or excuse me."
"4506040","4507360"," The art side comes under here. "
"4507600","4508000"," Sorry, I'm mad."
"4508660","4509020"," God, this wrong."
"4510460","4512120"," They want this blue line to come up. "
"4512360","4512860"," Put some space."
"4514400","4515860"," So that on their timeframe."
"4516920","4521340"," They can decide when they want to dump it with hawkish comments when they get the last dump below"
"4521340","4522080"," the orange line. "
"4522660","4523480"," Does that make sense?"
"4524400","4529040"," So when you're hearing this, when you see the Fed yesterday, the Fed was acting, they knew that"
"4529040","4530020"," they had the option."
"4531280","4536160"," To look at the economic data and say to you, yeah, we're going to dump it."
"4536780","4538720"," And there's some very smart people out there. "
"4540680","4542640"," They're like, oh shit, they're not dumping it."
"4542760","4543500"," This isn't the time."
"4544520","4547240"," The mic party goes out there and he deletes his Twitter and shit. "
"4548880","4551280"," Markets reacting that we're not ready to dump it."
"4551380","4552280"," So they're going to front run it."
"4554100","4556360"," Now you might be a bear saying, no, no, cap. "
"4556560","4558520"," They just wanted liquidity to do that last dump."
"4558900","4559340"," Okay."
"4560940","4562420"," Let's talk about that. "
"4564100","4568100"," So if they're looking for the liquidity to dump it and have that last crash."
"4568200","4573720"," This is the last irrational exuberance move higher for that death blow to the market."
"4574040","4575760"," And that's what this is right here. "
"4575760","4577740"," You know where you need to dump it."
"4578600","4588600"," You know, if you're a bear that right now currently you need to get below"
"4588600","4591340"," 398, 394 somewhere in there."
"4591520","4592580"," You need to get underneath this. "
"4593700","4598340"," We need to dump it, get underneath it, might take a week or two."
"4599100","4601000"," And that's where your trade is for death and destruction."
"4603200","4604020"," Does that make sense?"
"4604260","4605540"," And you got to beat some levels too. "
"4605660","4606300"," You got to beat what?"
"4607240","4609620"," 375, 360, and 345."
"4610280","4611840"," There's like three or four trades in here."
"4612620","4622480"," But until that happens from what the Fed was saying, it looks to me like banks know that they're"
"4622480","4625100"," trying to buy some time in the market. "
"4627780","4628760"," And that's what they did here."
"4628860","4629720"," They bought time."
"4630820","4631620"," That's the Fed did. "
"4631900","4632660"," And they're doing it again."
"4634700","4637860"," Or this is the Fed pivot and you just haven't seen it."
"4638520","4639820"," They haven't announced it yet. "
"4642860","4644960"," And let's say we do crash down below here."
"4646480","4648540"," Let's say we do crash down below here."
"4649480","4650720"," Let's say the bears are right. "
"4650960","4651180"," I'm wrong."
"4651480","4652800"," It's just liquidity grab up higher."
"4654400","4657460"," And the Fed's going to crash it in the next, I don't know, fucking month or something. "
"4660000","4661360"," Let's just say that's the case."
"4668540","4669740"," Let's say that's the case."
"4669740","4676200"," That would mean if you're a long equity as you put a hedge on, you wouldn't have a bearish stance. "
"4676440","4681100"," You'd have a hedge on that hedge would protect you."
"4681200","4682780"," This is 2018."
"4685180","4685620"," Right?"
"4686520","4689120"," This is December 17th. "
"4692300","4694220"," This is January 7th."
"4694760","4701360"," For one month, you would hold your equities, burr print your hedge and be right back to the price"
"4701360","4702300"," you were a month ago."
"4708600","4710240"," This is 2020. "
"4711000","4711800"," Fed pivot."
"4717560","4718440"," Same thing."
"4719340","4720820"," You're in full panic mode. "
"4720960","4724880"," I'm over here trying to cry this morning about buying dips with you, right?"
"4725080","4726120"," How stressful it is."
"4726240","4727780"," I'm telling you how stressful it is, right?"
"4731200","4733140"," That's a 10th of March, 2020."
"4733400","4735460"," That's the 9th of April, 2020. "
"4735760","4741780"," Can you imagine having been long this market and sold right here and then it blast back up and"
"4741780","4745120"," you're just like, I would be devastated if that happened."
"4745480","4750020"," If you had had a hedge on the market, you could have held your equities, gotten prints and then go"
"4750020","4750700"," right back up."
"4751780","4752720"," Does that make sense?"
"4756390","4759950"," Let's say you're like, well, Cap, what if we have 2000, 2008?"
"4762090","4763950"," You can see the difference here, right?"
"4766250","4769010"," The blue line didn't go underneath the orange line, did it?"
"4771610","4774970"," In 2008 and 2000, the blue line does go under. "
"4775870","4777670"," This is when the Fed couldn't save you."
"4781000","4784580"," So if you're like, yeah, Cap, we're going to have a 2000 or 2008 crash."
"4787180","4788440"," You know what I'm going to tell you?"
"4790960","4792500"," You know what I'm going to tell you right here?"
"4794080","4796260"," You better fucking hope that that blue line. "
"4803170","4808430"," I want to see that."
"4810870","4811870"," It's this simple."
"4812510","4816750"," I want to see that blue line coming underneath the orange line and I want to see price underneath. "
"4817570","4819010"," And hold and start selling."
"4819470","4824970"," If I see that right there, then I know we're in the 2000 and 2008 crash."
"4826790","4830730"," And until I see that, it's all bullshit. "
"4838030","4839150"," It's all bullshit."
"4839530","4840410"," You see that orange line?"
"4840690","4842670"," That's dangerous right here, right?"
"4846430","4846730"," You see it?"
"4848410","4850170"," Orange line was underneath, right?"
"4850330","4852190"," We broke underneath the orange line, we crashed."
"4852550","4854010"," That's our first crash right there. "
"4854730","4856990"," This is the crash that I was telling you to buy down here."
"4860840","4862200"," And you want your second crash."
"4862500","4863880"," I agree, we might have a second crash. "
"4864140","4865140"," We could have a second crash."
"4866680","4868020"," But we ain't here yet."
"4868340","4869400"," Are we right here right now?"
"4869800","4870720"," Fuck no, we ain't. "
"4877130","4877990"," Are we here?"
"4878790","4878910"," No."
"4878910","4883210"," Have we even started the process of getting down here underneath the orange line?"
"4883830","4884390"," No."
"4887470","4892510"," All that shit noise you hear on social media is shit noise you hear from news. "
"4894630","4897090"," We haven't even started the process yet of crashing."
"4901020","4902460"," I don't even want to fucking hear it."
"4903380","4908820"," Now if we start the process of crashing, we start confirming that huge ass like down. "
"4909060","4909580"," Where's the money?"
"4915400","4917120"," Huge money right there."
"4917120","4918420"," Huge money."
"4919420","4922040"," Huge money from the blue to the orange line, right?"
"4923020","4930180"," So until we get some expansion, some space in all this volatility, some space in this tension"
"4930180","4931040"," that's in the market. "
"4932100","4934340"," Or we break below all of them all at once."
"4935560","4937940"," We can go balls deep and short this market as a team."
"4939260","4940080"," I'm with you. "
"4948700","4949300"," I'm with you."
"4949380","4950080"," I'm with all in."
"4950400","4952040"," And I think that Murray knew this too. "
"4952040","4954100"," Leaving this role over here today."
"4955120","4956280"," This is what is this?"
"4957340","4961340"," How many points is that 50 points, 25 points, 100 points?"
"4964450","4966070"," Can this be the top maybe?"
"4966730","4967070"," Does it matter?"
"4967550","4969710"," We can go down another 800,000, 2,000 points."
"4970450","4971370"," That's where the juice is. "
"4971530","4972350"," That's where the money is."
"4974230","4975450"," Until that happens."
"4978170","4980710"," I don't care about 100 points or 50 points. "
"4980870","4982150"," I don't care about 20 points."
"4988860","4990120"," A little of all of you out there."
"4993430","4994670"," Every last one of you is. "
"5002170","5004190"," We stay bull through big earnings season."
"5004530","5005970"," Yeah, that doesn't mean we don't get pullbacks."
"5006090","5007550"," It doesn't mean we only go to four. "
"5007670","5009410"," Maybe we only go to 360 and bounce."
"5011890","5014270"," Maybe go to 300, 3000 and bounce."
"5014790","5016210"," Maybe we go to 1000, 1400. "
"5017470","5018650"," We'll trade it as it comes."
"5021090","5023530"," So as we start breaking levels and heading down."
"5023530","5024490"," We'll be there. "
"5024610","5025170"," We'll trade it down."
"5025250","5027590"," We get some confirmation and head down another 400 points."
"5027590","5028570"," Another 1000 points. "
"5029190","5030350"," I'm down with Mike Barrie."
"5031330","5034870"," But I want to see some breaking of some serious shit."
"5035290","5036590"," And I think that's what he was thinking. "
"5036590","5038730"," And Mike Wilson was thinking was, hey, we're coming to this."
"5039010","5041130"," This very dangerous spot in the market right now."
"5041130","5042030"," And I agree with them. "
"5042450","5045150"," We were in a very, very dangerous spot in the market."
"5045330","5046330"," And where we still are."
"5047730","5049290"," Even at the price that we're at. "
"5049410","5051250"," Where we still are at a dangerous spot in the market."
"5051790","5053270"," I still agree with that statement."
"5053270","5057310"," I don't think for a minute that we're in the middle of a bull market. "
"5057310","5058190"," We're in a bull run."
"5059530","5061730"," But do I think we're in the middle of a bull market?"
"5061970","5062330"," Fuck no."
"5062610","5063250"," We won't be. "
"5063830","5068450"," You have to, you have to manage your positions for the next one to three years."
"5068710","5069590"," One month, next month."
"5070370","5072090"," You can't just walk away and be like. "
"5072950","5073970"," Or you, I guess you could."
"5074150","5075770"," You could be like, yeah, I own Tesla at 100 bucks."
"5076710","5080350"," And I got some stink bids down below at 60, 40 and $20. "
"5080350","5081710"," I got what I got."
"5081770","5085610"," And I think I got a 10% cash waiting for Tesla to be $2."
"5088250","5090930"," So that doesn't mean you don't move on from here or not. "
"5091070","5093710"," It doesn't mean you can just move on from here."
"5093790","5097750"," You have to move on from here in the market and head yourself for."
"5098630","5099910"," A lower number. "
"5100390","5103070"," The cool part is that if we break down below."
"5103630","5105710"," That orange and blue line."
"5106430","5108810"," And more than likely going to get a nice crash. "
"5109570","5111510"," You can probably buy some dirt cheap."
"5113570","5115690"," 3200 3600 3200 3000."
"5116450","5117650"," A basket of them. "
"5118410","5119770"," For like four or five bucks."
"5119870","5121590"," You guys buy Tesla calls for $5."
"5122650","5124050"," And they burn to zero. "
"5124370","5125650"," So for me telling you."
"5126110","5130210"," Go out there and buy a hedge in the market to protect your ass to no brainer."
"5131670","5136050"," But this is most certainly whether we go up or down from here a moment in the market where. "
"5136850","5139470"," Your your stance should switch to."
"5140230","5143270"," The market's probably going to go up for a little while sideways and up."
"5143810","5145530"," And I'm in a hedging environment. "
"5145890","5146270"," I hedge."
"5147130","5149530"," My position where I just hedged in day trade."
"5150330","5153290"," Buy some some dirt cheap cheap insurance down the road. "
"5154050","5155550"," And you trade the market where it goes."
"5157590","5158890"," That's my take on it."
"5159490","5161930"," And just just guess what if I'm over here day trading. "
"5162670","5168490"," I'm a selling over bot and I'm buying oversold and we end up crashing one day wake up one morning."
"5169450","5175710"," And I don't know some event happens we get a credit crisis or we get a liquidity crisis or we"
"5175710","5181690"," get a debt ceiling crisis in June or we get fucking I don't know Taiwan has an earthquake or"
"5181690","5182030"," something."
"5182670","5186270"," Guess what I wake up and I have this hedge and you're going to call me and I'm going to"
"5186270","5187410"," call you and I'm going to say hey. "
"5187410","5191770"," Did you make any money and you're like hell yeah I made money man we just bloodbath thousand points"
"5191770","5192250"," overnight."
"5193230","5195150"," Thank you Japan just did something."
"5196030","5199110"," You know whenever nonsense is out there whenever news they have. "
"5199790","5205590"," Whenever they felt like it was time unemployment was high some kind of nonsense not nonsense but"
"5205590","5208290"," we're cash market traders what we care about the details."
"5209070","5213090"," Just care about protecting ourselves at this point and trying to move on in the market."
"5214330","5216110"," We could sit here all day long. "
"5217410","5221270"," We've sat here all day long since May trading sideways right."
"5222670","5225930"," And trading sideways since May man it's like February right."
"5226430","5228350"," What is it how many months is that nine months. "
"5230710","5231610"," Nine months."
"5242210","5244190"," If you don't know what I'm talking about here."
"5245450","5248950"," You should find some friends on the discord or a fin twit. "
"5250370","5251490"," Stock twits."
"5252350","5254590"," I don't know Wall Street bets."
"5256370","5256770"," Wherever. "
"5262930","5266030"," And all you got to do is be like hey man how do I hedge the market."
"5267130","5270930"," You know how do I buy and sell over sold or bought conditions whatever you do."
"5274460","5277520"," And move on as a trader move on as an investor. "
"5296210","5300690"," And that's why I think Barry came out and said if I had to guess why Barry came out as"
"5300690","5302130"," I'm sure he has a more complicated."
"5302130","5307850"," I mean I'm showing you lines that have you know are hard to explain math concepts in the"
"5307850","5308150"," background."
"5311070","5312450"," But if you. "
"5313910","5318570"," I'm sure they've got something like something like that that says yeah man we're either going down"
"5318570","5318890"," here."
"5320130","5322590"," Or we're going to push off a little bit."
"5323130","5325270"," This could be a silent bed pivot though. "
"5325890","5327650"," That's not being discussed publicly."
"5327650","5331490"," But the Fed knows that they had to put some space and buy some more time."
"5335420","5339080"," The timing wasn't right for Jay Powell to dump the market. "
"5339920","5340840"," It's that simple."
"5341380","5343920"," Everyone likes to complicate shit but it's not that complicated."
"5345080","5351340"," They really don't have like 20 floors of scientists telling them shit. "
"5352300","5358120"," These are like a bunch of old greedy very smart white guys."
"5359540","5364460"," That they do rely upon data but I'm telling you they caught they just make shit up."
"5364620","5367540"," If you go back and look at Yellen back in the GFC. "
"5368320","5370680"," She was like quoted like a week before it happened."
"5370960","5374560"," She was like as long as we save the housing market right."
"5375080","5377340"," She never thought we'd have the housing market crash. "
"5378420","5382400"," I mean these people are not the smartest well they're smart but they've got egos."
"5383800","5386980"," I don't know how many of you have ever been inside of a C suite."
"5386980","5393400"," What I'm telling you the egos of smart people or successful people is bizarre. "
"5395160","5396700"," It's so fucking bizarre."
"5400540","5403140"," Michael Barry called the top or something right."
"5403340","5405480"," It eventually comes true took like seven years. "
"5406800","5408720"," Lot of it as the smartest guy in the world."
"5410620","5414980"," You know you get that shit in the back of your mind and you're like you're fucking like we're"
"5414980","5416440"," crashing right now."
"5417300","5421840"," I know better than anybody else yeah eventually we're crashing but we didn't today. "
"5422480","5426060"," And you're a retail trader and investor and retail bear retail bull."
"5426600","5427840"," Whatever you are out there."
"5428680","5433380"," It's not like you can go to like tasty and be like can you hold that short for me for"
"5433380","5434260"," the next five years. "
"5435740","5439560"," No you're going to get an email and a phone call and they're going to laugh your ass out of"
"5439560","5440560"," the fucking picture right."
"5441500","5443420"," They're going to be like get the fuck out of here."
"5445280","5445760"," No. "
"5446980","5449360"," I'm not loaning you another hundred million dollars."
"5449700","5450080"," Crazy."
"5455140","5457180"," And it's not your bank. "
"5457860","5458880"," Mike Wilson's bank."
"5459400","5460260"," Marco's bank."
"5461720","5462860"," Jamie Diamond's bank. "
"5463740","5465300"," They get the keys to the Fed building."
"5465960","5466280"," Not you."
"5467540","5468400"," If they're wrong. "
"5469300","5470240"," It's okay."
"5477990","5479670"," Yeah they're not the smartest."
"5479670","5483430"," They're typically they talk really well and they sound like they're smart typically. "
"5485590","5487510"," But the ego is unreal."
"5489850","5490370"," Unreal."
"5491130","5493970"," And they don't show that publicly to you so you'll like you'll. "
"5494530","5496490"," But first time I was in a C-suite environment."
"5497830","5500270"," I was like I can't I was like I can't believe."
"5500950","5505470"," The levels and layers of bullshit until you get to this little room right here and here. "
"5505850","5508410"," That they're just fucking monsters behind a closed door."
"5509730","5511230"," Seriously fucking monsters."
"5511670","5516190"," No offense out there for your CEO listening and you might not be that guy. "
"5516770","5519690"," But I'm talking about like high level shit."
"5520010","5521050"," Very wealthy people."
"5522630","5524770"," You meet those guys behind a closed door. "
"5525030","5528430"," I don't care if they're men or women but they're fucking sociopaths."
"5529110","5529790"," Man they're fucking crazy."
"5529930","5531050"," They're crazy as fuck. "
"5533210","5535270"," Oh that's those guys psychotic."
"5536450","5537530"," Something like that."
"5538410","5539810"," They just happen not to kill people. "
"5556130","5557170"," Okay so."
"5563130","5564110"," Another thing you need to think."
"5565130","5570490"," Another thing you need to be thinking about today is tomorrow we've got tomorrow we have a non-farm"
"5570490","5570830"," payroll. "
"5573210","5575050"," So that's a tomorrow morning."
"5575850","5581890"," At eight thirty a.m. It's in final numbers in the ISM."
"5582670","5585470"," Next week though we've got claims. "
"5587670","5589650"," And that's on Thursday the ninth."
"5591410","5594450"," So you know that they could be front running right now."
"5594770","5596070"," People say they're front running claims. "
"5596550","5598350"," They're front running jobs possibly."
"5600210","5602070"," That's really where the vol is."
"5602070","5603190"," We've got vol on. "
"5603370","5606890"," So if you're a call buyer you could be getting trapped right now today."
"5607710","5611150"," Awaiting some volatility into tomorrow for non-farm or sorry."
"5611290","5612170"," Is that tomorrow Friday?"
"5612790","5613830"," Yeah today's Thursday. "
"5614450","5616330"," So you could be getting trapped into that."
"5616970","5622110"," Another key point about tomorrow being Friday is we'll look at the VIX."
"5624130","5628890"," And you know like most Fridays the bulls have been winning. "
"5630750","5632090"," This is the VIX right."
"5632310","5633610"," This is a one minute chart on the VIX."
"5634110","5635730"," It would just be a perfect day tomorrow. "
"5637010","5639130"," It's a torch all these call buyers."
"5640190","5641370"," Even into Monday."
"5642730","5645630"," I guess this isn't the right time frame but hold on here. "
"5650880","5653480"," You know this is a this is the VIX down here."
"5654080","5656080"," It would be perfect right Friday."
"5658160","5660120"," Monday just torch calls. "
"5661880","5663420"," Even if we continue higher."
"5665280","5667760"," It's like torch and calls Friday and Monday."
"5668460","5670180"," I would be buying ball right here by the way. "
"5671080","5672200"," I'd be buying ball today."
"5672540","5674620"," Not options but I'd be buying the underlying."
"5674760","5676960"," Like 17 bucks or something. "
"5677660","5679440"," Hold that shit for the next week or so."
"5680080","5681700"," Probably get a pretty sweet deal on that."
"5683140","5685100"," You can probably buy a ball into Monday. "
"5687440","5692840"," They'll force all of you call buyers to to re-enter a second time."
"5694160","5695400"," To double down."
"5698720","5701940"," We try to sell like $19 or something. "
"5709480","5712660"," Yeah, so I'd expect some some profit taking on Friday."
"5712660","5714100"," It might take till Monday."
"5715820","5717220"," Just looking at the VIX. "
"5718860","5723080"," VIX is telling you that we're not in a to relax a little bit."
"5724780","5725740"," Also sweet."
"5726000","5727360"," You know, we are trading at low volatility. "
"5728240","5730220"," If you want to know what the bottom is on VIX."
"5731160","5734700"," If we do try to trade higher to like three or four sixty or something."
"5735360","5736320"," Probably 13 bucks. "
"5736400","5737120"," It's way down here."
"5739640","5740360"," Somewhere in there."
"5745060","5747680"," I can't guarantee that we do a trade in here. "
"5748100","5751880"," Or if we trade this zone into 2023."
"5751880","5753700"," But I'm going to expect it's going to be down here."
"5753800","5754600"," There'll be some high peaks. "
"5754800","5755340"," We'll get up there."
"5756340","5758500"," If we can get down to like three sixty or something."
"5758740","5759120"," You can see. "
"5764630","5766530"," You know, you can see a VIX high of."
"5768170","5770270"," You know, like 23 or something like that."
"5770490","5771650"," Maybe maybe slightly higher. "
"5772810","5774430"," This is back in January."
"5774750","5777170"," It's looking a bigger chart than a different time."
"5782120","5784540"," Yeah, I could see 28 believe it or not. "
"5784680","5786040"," If that like three six zero."
"5786440","5789760"," I got to assume that this is like three sixty and this is three forty five."
"5790860","5791660"," Somewhere in there. "
"5794650","5797590"," I don't think three sixties off the table for this quarter either."
"5797590","5799070"," I still think that's on the table."
"5799770","5801530"," I'm not anti going to three sixty. "
"5802410","5807030"," I'm more concerned if that blue line rolls over the orange line."
"5807130","5809070"," If that blue line doesn't roll over the orange line."
"5809310","5811850"," Then I'm not that concerned if we roll down there. "
"5812270","5813550"," We will review that."
"5814090","5816370"," If we start trading, if we start bloodbath in it."
"5817330","5821950"," Whenever you guys like, we'll look at it every day and see if we're breaking below that blue line. "
"5822030","5825730"," If we are at some point, we'll look for a crash."
"5825730","5829770"," But until that happens."
"5831690","5833450"," We're not in that stance right now. "
"5834690","5836570"," We're in the pullbacks and by dips."
"5855970","5859090"," Yeah, I get some close friend of the channel."
"5859290","5862630"," Winky is telling me that there's massive call buying going on. "
"5863610","5867210"," You've got probably foreign investors trying to call by."
"5867370","5870470"," You probably have like some old guy sitting on his lazy boy."
"5870990","5881050"," He's calling up his brother's buddy or his local bank and saying, get"
"5881050","5886090"," me some exposure to this right now, sir, or a young man or a young woman. "
"5886710","5887790"," I know better than you."
"5887970","5888610"," Get me some exposure."
"5888990","5890950"," Drop a million dollars on spy or Tesla. "
"5891830","5892890"," I don't want to miss out on this."
"5893970","5896730"," This financial advisor is like, you shouldn't be doing this, sir."
"5898170","5900070"," This is not the time and place to do this. "
"5900130","5900910"," He's like, I don't care."
"5903130","5903530"," FOMO."
"5907480","5908860"," FOMO FOMO FOMO. "
"5909440","5919380"," I have like a hundred messages from this morning."
"5919380","5920660"," I haven't looked at any of them."
"5937430","5938310"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"5938650","5939950"," Binky's saying it's bourbon time."
"5940330","5941550"," Binky, Binky just texted me."
"5941730","5942470"," Is Binky in the stream?"
"5944810","5946830"," Yeah, that was my, that was my fair, right?"
"5947010","5949470"," We trade in here all day long or something, some kind of nonsense. "
"5949470","5950950"," We do this bullshit over here."
"5952710","5958410"," Trap your ass in here and then you have to wait until, you have to wait until tomorrow."
"5960390","5966090"," For all the, I bet, I bet, I'm not, I don't know, but I'm, I'm assuming that. "
"5967010","5971890"," I'm assuming that if your local bears are just, are just buying time or they're buying time."
"5972110","5976850"," I said Biden time, but buying time right now to short the shit out of this."
"5977950","5980970"," Just like, you can see it right here, right?"
"5981190","5982150"," Oh, I don't know if you can see it. "
"5982170","5982430"," Hold on."
"5985770","5987290"," You can see it right here."
"5987350","5991170"," These bears are like, come on to daddy, baby. "
"5991390","5993670"," I bet you, Derrick coat noise out there right now."
"5993750","5995850"," He's like, he's like, come to daddy."
"5997350","6001150"," Cause he's, he's, he's been bullish, but he's a, he's a barren heart. "
"6001170","6002070"," He's probably out there."
"6002250","6004110"," Like he says this thing where he says, come to daddy."
"6004110","6006530"," He's just waiting to short this down. "
"6009670","6011110"," He's just waiting up here."
"6011570","6012730"," He's like, keep squeezing."
"6013130","6014350"," They double dog dare you. "
"6024250","6024770"," Yeah."
"6024930","6028970"," Bears got to be getting, not salty, but they can taste the short."
"6029210","6029430"," Look at that. "
"6029650","6030690"," Squeeze and hire again."
"6031810","6032330"," Unreal."
"6037430","6037950"," Savage. "
"6043480","6045220"," We're going to have to look for range expansion."
"6045660","6047000"," See if we're getting it here or not."
"6047460","6052200"," I'm going to have to check and see the puts and calls in the market at the end of the"
"6052200","6052640"," day today. "
"6053420","6054960"," And see if we're getting any range expansion."
"6056340","6060680"," See if the, if we, if you see more money in the money calls, we're not going up."
"6061380","6067260"," You need to see like people, people getting stupid and buying like four forties, four sixties. "
"6068060","6069420"," I mean, that kind of nonsense."
"6071680","6072820"," For us to go up higher."
"6073040","6074620"," You can't, you start to see a shift from. "
"6074620","6077840"," So like we're at four, seventeen right now."
"6078880","6085080"," If you have, if you have like a, let's say we're at 390 or 400, you see 420 calls."
"6086200","6087220"," That's range expansion. "
"6087660","6092080"," If we trade up to 417, you don't see more calls now added into the market at 440."
"6092960","6093840"," We're not going to go up to 430."
"6094740","6099020"," If you start to see the calls change from way outside the money to ways inside the money. "
"6099760","6101440"," We'll probably get a roll over at some point."
"6108730","6111150"," I'm going to take a look at the breadth indicator real quick."
"6114840","6116480"," It's just flat right now. "
"6117320","6119180"," It's overbought, but not by a ton."
"6121180","6124300"," It looks more rotational right now, to be honest with you."
"6125820","6128020"," We have a new high on rotation too. "
"6130950","6133110"," This looks like we're in rotation right now."
"6137260","6139740"," You guys want to see it, I'll bring it up on screen for you."
"6142840","6144100"," This looks like rotation. "
"6152250","6153870"," It's kind of plateauing here."
"6155130","6156410"," But it is a new high."
"6157330","6160050"," A little bit drop down below here in the 30th. "
"6163940","6165920"," And see we get new highs, right?"
"6166660","6169860"," Rotate it down, got a new high, got a new high, rolled it over."
"6170520","6171620"," It still looks like rotational."
"6186120","6189080"," I showed you guys these oscillators last week. "
"6190320","6191880"," You guys remember seeing these?"
"6193200","6195020"," Still not overbought on the daily."
"6197980","6199740"," Still not a peak on the daily."
"6199980","6200920"," We could still go up here. "
"6205490","6206910"," Look at this down here."
"6207590","6209030"," I showed you guys the weekly, right?"
"6209830","6211130"," I mean we're not even done here."
"6211850","6212370"," This is a weekly. "
"6214050","6216030"," We're not even done here in the weekly."
"6218830","6219510"," See that?"
"6223870","6229310"," Now the monthly, I think it was looking a little, yeah."
"6229470","6231250"," So we're losing a little bit of momentum here in the monthly. "
"6232590","6233650"," A little bit, right?"
"6233910","6237370"," But you see these purple bars are getting smaller, right?"
"6238330","6240670"," So even on a monthly we're looking to explode higher."
"6241030","6242330"," You see this curl up here?"
"6243970","6246210"," These purple bars are going to turn into green bars."
"6248230","6254790"," So when you're talking about where we're headed, likelihood of where we're headed, what is"
"6254790","6255950"," everything saying to you?"
"6256710","6258630"," It's screaming that we're going higher. "
"6263980","6268140"," On a weekly, on a monthly, there'd be a prior example."
"6270260","6271920"," Does it mean that so?"
"6274480","6277940"," But for a stance like what's my position?"
"6278620","6280420"," What's my stance right now?"
"6280700","6282380"," It should be bullish with hedging."
"6284360","6290900"," If you're a bear, you have now switched to looking for rotational puts. "
"6291680","6298480"," You're looking for oversold conditions to short, sorry, overbought conditions to short."
"6302960","6311370"," You're probably looking to hedge to the upside until we're proven otherwise."
"6322030","6329950"," If any of you have traded when we've hit a local bottom on a daily weekly or monthly chart, I"
"6329950","6335010"," wouldn't say a daily but a weekly and monthly if you're looking at like crashes we've had if you've"
"6335010","6344270"," traded in 2018, 2008, 2020, you guys all know out there that we leave bears behind. "
"6344970","6349790"," They'll make a million dollars and they'll be at zero if we continue higher."
"6353770","6359950"," So I would say if you don't want to get left behind, you're now being told to trade to the"
"6359950","6360210"," level."
"6360210","6363250"," Remember when bulls had to trade to the level in 2022?"
"6363630","6368250"," I would say it's now the balls in your court to trade down to a level. "
"6369830","6374590"," It's not for you to just buy a short and hold it for the next three months."
"6375870","6382850"," You have to buy a hedge, buy a market hedge, buy a call hedge, and I would be trading to"
"6382850","6386650"," the level down as a bear until proven otherwise."
"6388050","6397560"," And so you got like think of it like a football"
"6397560","6400380"," game and you're down 45 right now to zero. "
"6400840","6402900"," You got to slap some points on the board."
"6402920","6404320"," You got to start breaking some levels."
"6405180","6409220"," So it's you know you want to get into the third quarter and not be down zero to 45. "
"6409340","6413900"," You want to be like 32 to 45 or something and be like well we have a chance here right"
"6413900","6414160"," now."
"6415260","6417020"," I'm just going to go balls deep short."
"6417020","6422640"," I understand that you're only like a TD and a field goal and a safety away from killing everybody. "
"6422700","6426960"," So I get that but right now you're like down 45 zero right now."
"6442530","6445030"," They're torched in the four 18s right now."
"6445210","6448450"," I'm trying to burn the theta off them so they can make the move and not pay you. "
"6461370","6463050"," Everybody wants to blaze 420."
"6464550","6466030"," 420 69 right."
"6477730","6479950"," I'm going to read some news off to you this morning. "
"6481090","6482770"," It's already afternoon it's 1233."
"6490750","6495770"," U.S. equities futures rose adding to the gains gained on Wall Street after fed reserved here."
"6495990","6501010"," Jay Powell stated that policymakers had made headway in the fate of fight against inflation. "
"6502510","6506790"," Getting investors hope that the central bank cycle of rate hikes is about to come to an end."
"6507610","6511610"," The S&P 500 NASDAQ 100 contracts this is not true by the way."

"6688910","6692850"," strategically and military that was based on counter-insurgency. "
"6695510","6698190"," And we moved to that, of course."
"6699370","6708750"," We had a doctrine of fighting a large land war with major superpower like China or,"

"6821410","6830530"," Futurists, though, they're like, the expectations or"
"6830530","6837490"," like a scope, I guess, of what the United, if you travel a lot outside of a tourist area, you"
"6837490","6843950"," realize just stark differences in what you're, what you think things are in the rest of the world"

"6876250","6882510"," But anyways, when it comes to Russia, Ukraine and stuff like that, just in terms of the market or"
"6882510","6887490"," whatever, what will that war and or will Ukraine prevail?"
"6887790","6892570"," As long as the West supports, I'm sure that the US likely likes keeping Ukraine in the war too."
"6893510","6902430"," The US likely wants to see Russia occupied and also wants the time to train up to fight China."
"6903850","6910990"," I was talking to Volwiz last night and I was talking to Joe Harper this morning. "
"6911510","6913110"," And so this is staying on topic here."
"6914810","6920930"," However, how this relates to the market, regardless of your thought process on what we should be"
"6920930","6926530"," doing or not be doing, I want you to put your trader hat on and think about that and it"
"6926530","6929470"," impacts or risk to the market."
"6929710","6934210"," So if you're looking for those moments in the market where we could have bloodbath in our markets,"
"6934210","6938470"," you're like, well, what could happen or what risk is there to the market?"
"6940070","6942490"," Let's say there was an invasion of Taiwan. "
"6943110","6946330"," What would you, how would you hedge that?"
"6946870","6951790"," Does any of you have thoughts out there on how to hedge that war or the threat of that war?"
"6951950","6953190"," Sometimes it's just the threat of it, right?"
"6954410","6959390"," Tensions become hostile and we have a meeting right now with China over economic policy."
"6960350","6962170"," So let's talk about that right now."
"6962350","6970650"," So in the chat, you tell me you tell me what you think about"
"6970650","6974590"," I'm not getting into politics and shit like that. "
"6974910","6975710"," You guys would be surprised."
"6976010","6976410"," I'm a Democrat."
"6976510","6981290"," You guys would be shocked that I'm an old school Democrat from back in the day. "
"6981770","6985410"," But my family served their country through generations."
"6985410","6992090"," And so to me, I felt like I was raised with a duty for trying to be a better country,"
"6992330","6993270"," even when we fail, right?"
"6993450","6997970"," Let's say we're a treat people bad or we treat, we don't treat people with equal rights and stuff."
"6998650","7001890"," I think our military tries to defend what's in our constitution. "
"7004410","7007790"," And we make mistakes as a country all the time, right?"
"7008810","7014110"," But just the idealistic aspect of taking care of people, taking care of our own people, that kind"
"7014110","7014410"," of stuff."
"7014890","7016750"," It's not political, it's apolitical, I guess."
"7017790","7022670"," But let's move on from that in the politics of it and get into how this affects you as a"
"7022670","7023670"," trader, as an investor. "
"7024470","7033790"," So if you are in this market, how do you protect yourself against a potential conflict"
"7033790","7036670"," or an economic war with China?"
"7036850","7041330"," You tell me in the chat what you would do or what you would consider as a hedge."
"7041510","7046550"," Because interestingly enough, I went in the late night last night, this is what I do at nighttime,"
"7046890","7047010"," right?"
"7047730","7051890"," I'm on the phone with a ball whiz last night and I'm like, all right, I'm going to go down"
"7051890","7055650"," into S O X X and semiconductors."
"7056210","7060490"," And I'm going to look at the put complex on semiconductors. "
"7061830","7068030"," So I look at the put complex on semiconductors and I'm like, geez, I'm like somebody already bought"
"7068030","7069770"," all the puts and then pushed them on everybody."
"7070450","7080430"," So now you've got everybody sitting inside of a leaps on puts as a hedge on semiconductors for"
"7080430","7081630"," years out from now."
"7081930","7083330"," And I was like, Oh, that's crowded, man. "
"7083450","7084170"," I'm not buying that."
"7084450","7085990"," I'm like, that shit's all pumped up."
"7087750","7088910"," Everybody's already in that shit. "
"7090950","7094310"," So I'm like, how do you, how do you hedge that?"
"7094390","7095810"," How do you, well, I'll ask you questions."
"7097650","7098430"," How do you hedge?"
"7098590","7099270"," I'll do a Q and A."
"7099970","7102850"," I think I can do a Q and A on YouTube."
"7103050","7103830"," So I'll do a Q and A."
"7104370","7105350"," Everyone asks two questions. "
"7105670","7106250"," How can you hedge?"
"7108530","7108990"," Excuse me."
"7111210","7115790"," Even if you're late to the party, let's say, like, I'm late to the party and never head."
"7115790","7118170"," I think, okay. "
"7118630","7119630"," So how do you hedge?"
"7119970","7123350"," We're haven't they heads would be the key to this question."
"7123530","7127010"," I'm going to give the shout out to volatility or ball pivot."
"7127310","7131590"," He's calling himself right now, but his name's volatility was I'm going to give a shout out to him"
"7131590","7142350"," on fin to it and say, I'm going to say to you, if everyone's already heads for that event, how"
"7142350","7151730"," do you find an instrument that no one's in right now that doesn't have premium built into it and is"
"7151730","7161390"," likely likely to be a trade that nobody would see coming if that if that event happened. "
"7161650","7168090"," And the key behind this is that you would want to be in a trade that nobody's thought of yet"
"7168090","7173270"," and that once it becomes apparent, people would rush into that trade."
"7173810","7176010"," Now, it doesn't actually matter if we have a war."
"7176230","7183070"," It just matters that there's a threat of war and that's used in the news not to create some kind"
"7183070","7184230"," of volatility, right?"
"7184470","7185570"," You don't actually have to trade the event. "
"7185850","7189070"," You have to hold it through if it's resolved or not."
"7189170","7191290"," You just need to get a mad rush, right?"
"7192250","7193870"," A FOMO into that trade."
"7195490","7197110"," You kind of have to chew on it. "
"7197590","7198990"," Someone asked two questions, okay?"
"7199150","7199850"," Here's a Q&A."
"7201090","7202030"," How do you head?"
"7205270","7208970"," If everyone's already in S O X X and puts, you miss the trade, right?"
"7209830","7210650"," You miss the trade."
"7211650","7217090"," I don't want to be, I don't want to be buying S O X puts before or after everybody else"
"7217090","7217390"," has. "
"7217630","7218770"," I want to buy S O X X."
"7218770","7223550"," McCarthy says, we will not pass a clean debt saving bill without some spending reforms."
"7225550","7230330"," So if I've missed it at this point, how do you- S and B's Jordan says, price stability does"
"7230330","7231430"," not happen automatically."
"7262730","7264090"," So there's the Q&A. "
"7264530","7268590"," How do you hedge an economic war with China or threat of invasion with Taiwan?"
"7270810","7271830"," That's my question for you."
"7280260","7282220"," I'll leave that for you in the chat."
"7286700","7288240"," Something that you can just buy and leave. "
"7289300","7293420"," Like you buy it three months out or not three months by like two years out, three years out, five"
"7293420","7296200"," years out and you just leave it in your account somewhere."
"7297580","7299160"," Dirt cheap cost nothing."
"7301880","7304120"," And as a cost nothing, it's dirt cheap. "
"7304960","7312700"," And let's say you buy it for 50 cents and then immediately you're in for 50 cents and you"
"7312700","7315800"," immediately, so you're like getting an alert and you're like, oh, it filled finally."
"7316960","7321040"," Oh, it filled and I'm going to go back in and manage the trade."
"7321160","7326640"," So I bought a 50 cents and I'm just going to do a limit sell on it or just the"
"7326640","7331760"," sell on it of a dollar or three dollars or something like that. "
"7332500","7335800"," Five hundred percent, three hundred percent, five thousand percent."
"7337220","7346480"," We're have people not thought to hedge that volatility, not the actual event, just the volatility"
"7346480","7349160"," of that event because you know our news cycle is right."
"7350340","7353700"," Our news that we don't really care if the event actually takes place or not. "
"7354360","7360580"," We don't want the event to take place but you know it's going to at some point they're going to"
"7360580","7365560"," like, oh man, I'm going to start reporting on this and eventually I'm going to be the go-to person"
"7365560","7366000"," for this."
"7366200","7368920"," If it blows up, I'm going to make my whole entire career."
"7369360","7372160"," I'm going to create a story out of this where there is some kind of a story but not a"
"7372160","7375240"," big story yet and I'm going to start creating shit. "
"7381360","7389260"," Ah, someone out there, I just, I'm not going to say who but someone out there, someone out there"
"7389260","7403300"," just tagged it, someone's on the right, someone's on the right track right here, someone's"
"7403300","7404380"," on the track on the right track."
"7404580","7406360"," So let me see who's on the right track right now."
"7407320","7408640"," Let me see what you guys' answers are. "
"7415550","7418030"," War is bullish, you buy the up and dip."
"7418670","7420270"," So Darth Molly's on the right track."
"7420270","7430550"," A career low is really on the right track and then"
"7430550","7436150"," Jason is sniffing around, Jason's sniffing around right now. "
"7436290","7445950"," He's like, here's a question, right?"
"7446110","7446710"," Here's a good one, right?"
"7447030","7450630"," So who just posted this right here?"
"7451330","7453990"," Dan Brizlin just said, what about the end of the Ukraine war?"
"7455370","7458430"," So right now we should be positioned long, right?"
"7459190","7460950"," For the end of the Ukraine war, make sense?"
"7462230","7466030"," We should be positioned with a hedge on the market and looking for sideways and up."
"7466550","7467850"," So we should be good on that."
"7468790","7473010"," If they run it up for an end of the Ukraine war, we're positioned for that to happen right now. "
"7477830","7479390"," Boing, Raytheon, shorting commodities."
"7482350","7482910"," Okay."
"7484570","7486630"," Well, you guys are all on the right track. "
"7486830","7494450"," So let's say that tomorrow there was a threat to Taiwan, right?"
"7494830","7499810"," And semiconductors from Taiwan came under threat."
"7500830","7503850"," There's going to be a semiconductor shortage in Taiwan."
"7505470","7512630"," What would be the company that you wouldn't think would move on that?"
"7516240","7521880"," Well, what companies would do well with with no semiconductors from Taiwan?"
"7524670","7526910"," Like a dog that doesn't move. "
"7528690","7535710"," As a matter of fact, the last time this dog of a stock move moved was, we have an example"
"7535710","7536590"," in recent history."
"7537570","7539470"," And it actually didn't happen."
"7539990","7540610"," You got it. "
"7542390","7543930"," You got it."
"7546330","7548410"," No, you don't full port Intel."
"7550070","7551410"," But what do you do?"
"7553770","7560190"," You start seeking out other producers that are dirt, that are dogs. "
"7560190","7566690"," And you go, what do I'm going to look at an outside the money call as far out as I"
"7566690","7567190"," can get it."
"7567970","7572030"," I'm like a dog that nobody trades like shit that nobody likes."
"7572350","7573230"," Everybody hates it. "
"7573750","7574950"," It never moves."
"7577740","7582280"," And you find examples on those companies when they have moved on just farting in the wind."
"7583980","7587040"," Remember when, remember when who is going to buy TikTok?"
"7587780","7589680"," Does anybody remember who is going to buy TikTok?"
"7590520","7591160"," The rumor?"
"7591820","7595180"," What company was rumored to be in a deal to buy TikTok?"
"7595360","7595620"," Do you remember?"
"7596400","7597500"," You guys already said it. "
"7598260","7601860"," No, that was the first company that was rumored to buy TikTok."
"7612300","7613380"," It's I N T C."
"7614940","7617360"," I N T C or so Oracle is the example."
"7618140","7620200"," So Oracle doesn't move, right?"
"7621500","7624320"," And Oracle on just a fart in the wind. "
"7626180","7627820"," Move right for the first time."
"7628120","7630780"," So does does I N T C move right now?"
"7631460","7631900"," No."
"7634240","7635040"," Data dog. "
"7636040","7636260"," It's it."
"7636480","7637520"," Yeah, it's I N T C."
"7637960","7638940"," The answer is I N T C."
"7639100","7649000"," So you see, we already know that I N T C"
"7649000","7653100"," is it's where tech goes to die, right?"
"7657960","7663620"," It's like, it's like, it's like, we're always looking for like, I was looking at S O X X and"
"7663620","7667740"," I'm like, everybody knows to, to long and short S O X X."
"7669380","7673920"," And like, can you just imagine if there was a semi cut ductors shortage and you have to, you have"
"7673920","7678960"," to like, you're looking around the room and it's that one old sloppy guy in the corner with the"
"7678960","7682760"," with the nerd glasses on and he's like, eating his cake in the office."

"8872170","8880830"," that on another video i'll write it down because it is important that's a good question i'm being"
"8880830","8888730"," asked why does mark when market goes up i could give you a simple answer right now i think i've"
"8888730","8895250"," answered that in the past i think i've answered that in the past but i'll do tend to a more"
"8895250","8899450"," in-depth video about it but you know what i could do is i could ask vol ways to help"
"8899450","8908890"," with the explanation because he does a really good job of simplifying volatility and what it really"
"8908890","8917210"," is a measure of and then the decoupling of dixie can be dangerous too dixie can actually that's"
"8917210","8924110"," crazy about dixie is dixie can actually you want to see dixie coming up with the market coming up"
"8924110","8930090"," right now not safe for sure that any future rate rises will be in smaller steps so this is going"
"8930090","8937030"," to sound crazy to you i'm going to i'm going to meet the the new squad uh i want you"
"8937030","8943810"," guys on your own right not with me right now go on like trading view and i want you to"
"8943810","8951890"," look at moments where the stock market is crashed and you'll actually see dixie crash along with"
"8951890","8958850"," the stock market i know that sounds counterintuitive but you'll have you'll have a volatility in"
"8958850","8965730"," the market where we're going to change direction or have a crash and i don't mean like uh like the"
"8965730","8973110"," first crash of 2022 i mean like a real crash like 2000 2008 you'll actually see uh dixie start"
"8973110","8982010"," crashing too and it's not quite decoupling uh but you'll see uh divergences that are other"
"8982010","8989010"," unanticipated unexpected so seeing dixie trying to fight in the market going up at the open made"
"8989010","8994130"," sense to me and yesterday when we were in stream uh someone asked me why i wasn't i think it"
"8994130","8998190"," was joe that asked me why i wasn't what what our dixie wasn't the accurate predictor for me right"
"8998190","9004210"," now and it was because of where we were in the stock market or where we are in the stock"
"9004210","9015530"," market uh vix also we can have volatility due to a possible directional change up or down um if"
"9015530","9021510"," you it's really neat if you look close if you if you're able to get access to uh vix charts"

"9040710","9046910"," true uh not a real one like a bad one you'll actually see uh dixie start crashing uh so it"
"9046910","9053390"," gives a false signal i guess uh but he does a much better job of explaining it so i'll ask"
"9053390","9057070"," him on the side if he can help out maybe he does a video or something or he joins us"
"9057070","9068320"," and explains that concept to you better uh"

"9570560","9579380","&p 500 um but when i just want a quick look at it i i use the um market breath"
"9579380","9587640"," indicator on um on trading view and what i like about the simplicity of it is down here it just"
"9587640","9592260"," gives you a quick idea and if you watch this every week or five days whatever you can see what"
"9592260","9598580"," they're buying and selling you can see like uh real estate uh real estate uh sector is overbought"
"9598580","9608120"," you can see technology is getting there i always try to watch utilities if utilities are low and"
"9608120","9613620"," like just under five minutes time you're expected to take comments from ecb's president legald then"
"9613620","9622060"," i'm wondering so are they rotating out of tech and into utilities uh is energy like energy hasn't"
"9622060","9629660"," had a bid that's what takes us to the next level um you saw communications is risk on uh consumer"
"9629660","9637660"," defensives staples right here or discretionary sorry you see risk on and uh discretionary but you"
"9637660","9643800"," don't see risk on in staples yet what it's starting to but not quite like there's a little rotation"
"9643800","9650700"," going on right now um into some more defensive side of the of the market but there's still a bid"
"9650700","9657300"," oh this is a little bit of room and tech set 89 it's not quite at 100 percent uh financials"
"9657300","9662380"," starting to catch a bid finally we didn't see that yesterday remember i was watching financials"
"9662380","9667820"," yesterday so i'm like taking a look around the market with that right i'll look at that all right"
"9667820","9672040"," let me bring this back up again now it now now are we in rotation or not is the question"
"9672040","9679500"," right is this a top or not or are we just rotating just probably one more rotation in here into"
"9679500","9683980"," defensives probably not going to roll over unless we have a market something like this right here"
"9683980","9689960"," and we sell it but even if we do what do i use something like this for is it's a"
"9689960","9694000"," really like you know it does a great job of this is den niles whether you like them or hate"
"9694000","9701280"," them uh den niles will come in after the fact and say uh you know we're bearish we're net sellers"
"9701280","9707200"," of this market and he will literally come on cnbc the day after and go uh we're net bearish in"
"9707200","9714580"," the market but we bought an oversold bounce down below here and so that's that's right now i've"
"9714580","9722060"," been reduced to this for the past year uh where or not year but 2022 specifically i used to make"
"9722060","9727100"," this trade prior to 2022 but it was much easier i would make this trade every month believe it or"
"9727100","9734420"," not but in 2022 i've only had now we're in 2023 but in 2022 i've had seven chances on it"
"9734420","9739620"," and i've missed one out of seven uh that i won as a matter of fact if i had stayed"
"9739620","9744660"," in the seventh one i would have paid but i got scared not that that matters um and i put"
"9744660","9749980"," a little bit too much risk on and time and that trade as well um and you can you're going"
"9749980","9754200"," to get uh in the website you're going to get a whole section on how to trade this this is"
"9754200","9758200"," how i make my money if you guys want to know how i make that money in the stock market"
"9758200","9766080"," uh i tend to be i tend to have less success uh selling the market up here uh especially in"
"9766080","9772520"," a bull market uh because what you'll do is you'll find they um what you'll do is you'll find a"
"9772520","9782520"," uh uh at tops tend to take longer to roll over in time and can be irrational longer than bottoms"
"9782520","9788560"," and we find a bottom in an oversold condition it's typically a capitulation move wayum it slams"
"9788560","9793800"," down and then we're off and running so on the call side of this call spreads with time on him"
"9793800","9799400"," i've this was that actually makes me money so yesterday we had a trader that said he made a bunch"
"9799400","9805920"," of money he's like i just made a ton of money and i was like take your clothes all out"
"9805920","9813080"," take your money and run so how i trade is let's say i make a bunch of money let's say"

"9830400","9839140"," come from that trading it comes from buying oversold bounces using this indicator specifically if"
"9839140","9845920"," we get super oversold you can't sell there's no one left to sell into so the market's natural"
"9845920","9855060"," reaction this is even in a i was actually buying dips the whole way down uh"
"9855060","9863360"," i was buying dips when we got oversold i bought a dip in it just rocket ship so that's how"
"9863360","9868840"," i make my money let's say i make a 50 grand on one of these trades i will take a"
"9868840","9874620"," thousand bucks let's say put it into a day trading account and i'll try to make let's say 20 grand"
"9874620","9882020"," or 5 grand or 10 grand or whatever your target is i'll take that five grand let's say i put"
"9882020","9886920"," a brand inside of a day trading account i turned to five thousand bucks i take four grand out and"
"9886920","9893570"," trade it again from a thousand i take that four grand out of the market or add it to the"
"9893570","9900090"," pile to do my trading that i know uh prints like nine out of ten times 28 out of 30"

"14945320","14949120"," so what we'll do is we're going to look at a few things we're going to chart out the expected"
"14949120","14955840"," moves on google apple or does it get google apple and amazon right we'll put a chart up for a"
"14955840","14962020"," spy we can do a chart you guys want to trade after hours uh the cues instead i don't know"

"14975890","14988050"," on each ticker wait i'm losing my voice here hold on i've been"
"14988050","14998170"," talking too much yeah he was a very smart guy ruthless ruthless person uh"
"14998170","15002210"," and what we'll do is we'll talk about synthetically trading these companies if you're just joining"
"15002210","15008210"," us and haven't joined us or don't know us uh one of the my favorite trades and earnings season is"
"15008210","15013030"," the run up right that's my favorite trade like the run up where you're either selling the company"
"15013030","15021390"," down in earnings or you're buying the company up into earnings once we get to earnings day i tend"
"15021390","15029310"," to hate holding anything through earnings but what you can do sometimes is trade earnings through"
"15029310","15035550"," an index like spy right or nasdaq and you can actually trade it from like 4 p.m and to"
"15035550","15044050"," 4 15 p.m and try to catch the initial reactions now with so many companies reporting today um you"
"15044050","15050890"," can easily get um a fast move down and then a fast move up or you get a fast move"
"15050890","15059370"," up and then you short it down so let's say we've got great earnings right and we blast higher we'll"
"15059370","15066850"," typically come back to a meme by open not always sometimes you'll get continuation uh but not"
"15066850","15073910"," always uh and then the cool part about this is sometimes you can trade synthetically from just 4 to"
"15073910","15080430"," 4 15 so you're in you made your money and you get out you don't care about what happens tomorrow"
"15080430","15088230"," uh and then there's usually a continuation play for earnings after earnings right so you trade them"
"15088230","15094510"," trade into the earnings see into the earnings report you cut yourself out take your money and run"
"15094510","15100110"," which is likely happening right here taking some risk off the table into tech earnings and then"
"15100110","15105350"," you've got the second trade which is for 15 minutes and then the next day you don't care where it"
"15105350","15115350"," went uh typically they'll next"
"15115350","15122190"," morning so they I mean let's you have some really material great news even when you do have"
"15122190","15128390"," material great news or bad news we tend to tag the upper and lower ends of the options that are"
"15128390","15135590"," out there uh either that day or the next one to three days and then the real move comes for"
"15135590","15142270"," that ticker up or down they'll start to then trade it up or they'll begin to trade it down take"
"15142270","15148750"," profits off the table that kind of stuff uh so there really is three trades here and uh whatever"
"15148750","15153730"," your favorite ticker is and the synthetic one is one of my favorites because I see people on on"
"15153730","15160170"," social media all the time that hold through earnings and I'm like why would you ever do that when"
"15160170","15164990"," you can trade it on a on a on an index and you can get out if you get a"
"15164990","15171270"," bad earnings can you imagine like can you imagine like owning some calls and in google and then"
"15171270","15177130"," they get a bad report and they start selling and you can't get out of your calls that's just that"
"15177130","15186430"," it's insane to me absolutely insane um so we'll we'll start those out right now and uh"

"16018270","16027630"," um some kind of news we don't know man i don't see us moving higher than this 154 i think"
"16027630","16035410"," that's top personally uh to be honest with you bulls love buying our banks love buying dips look to"
"16035410","16040790"," me it looks like this dip was bought i think any move above here is going to get sold off"
"16040790","16047610"," unless there's a um i think that to me apple is like a i think apple even if it squeezes"
"16047610","16053950"," up here it's going to be flat by by open or even profit taking down here into next week uh"
"16053950","16061110"," probably not that low if if ER is good in apple unless there's something we don't know like an"
"16061110","16065230"," apple car i think by open it's going to come back down they're going to look for a dip buy"
"16065950","16073690"," uh for the future if there's some really nasty news uh and we start breaking below this implied"
"16073690","16082590"," move right here i would be really scared for the market itself and we'll do we'll we'll watch apple"
"16082590","16087550"," after the bell that's it right there and i'm going to think that i'm going to put a red a"
"16087550","16094850"," red box now if the market's going to go crazy like you want to start seeing 420 uh you want"
"16094850","16104640"," to see us trade above now you want to see us start not only hit the implied move"
"16104640","16113280"," but start moving higher if you want me taking what apple is probably decent earnings uh they their"
"16113280","16119840"," er report though takes forever usually uh i'd really like to see like this move up profit taking"
"16119840","16126920"," and then by open maybe somewhere in here uh then they're going to start taking profit down here"
"16126920","16133760"," into friday and monday this could take into monday and then you'll see the real move on on apple"
"16133760","16143520"," that's my that's my guess my guess is we go up here come back into this trend by open"
"16145600","16152060"," they start selling it down into friday take the money and run this could take also take into monday"
"16152060","16160900"," right here and then we're looking for the market to buy a dip and head higher that's my take on"
"16160900","16172830"," apple oh you guys want to do amazon next yeah"
"16175230","16187380"," i know apple car uh so that's what i think on apple uh"
"16187380","16195780"," we talked about uh amazon we talked about uh amazon in the past where i'd like to buy it if"
"16195780","16200760"," you ever come back down to 85 bucks i'm all in i want you guys to realize something that there's"
"16200760","16205900"," a fun i want you to realize whether you like it or not i don't care what you think i"
"16205900","16211480"," want you to know that the market thinks that we're at a tradeable bottom and there are people out"
"16211480","16218480"," there institutions out there there are uh i've already talked about this ad ad nauseam i've talked"
"16218480","16228100"," about this you can just add it up 80 bucks if we last down and i can buy 50 bucks"
"16228100","16237660"," where does that leave me y'all know right leaves me at 65 bucks right so if you're a bear"
"16237660","16245500"," out there trying to tell me about amazon i'm going to tell you that i own amazon at 65 and"
"16245500","16252260"," if we keep going higher i didn't miss it at 81 uh any kind of doom you try to give"
"16252260","16257220"," me i can buy a hedge on amazon and i can still loan it at 65 there's no doom that"
"16257220","16263880"," you can tell me right here uh that doesn't make me want to buy amazon so i am sure a"
"16263880","16272580"," hundred percent positively sure that there is demand so you're going to see demand in these er's"
"16272580","16279920"," okay um you're going to see it you know i don't care what narrative you're trying to tell me i"
"16279920","16287300"," don't care about uh they make a market they did it they did this in 2020 now they said there's"
"16287300","16296000"," no way small caps are going up and people got fucking torched lose my voice i'm gonna pick tomorrow"
"16296000","16304080"," off my voice is really fucked up so that's a very simple explanation for you as to what to expect"
"16304080","16313400"," on amazon earnings now i know there's a pump show going on in here but i assure you that there"
"16313400","16319260"," are bulls out there just begging for a bad earnings there are bulls out there begging for a dip buy"
"16319260","16325760"," whether you like it or not that's what's going on and you need to be aware of that i want"
"16325760","16338340"," i need you to be aware of that so 10733 this is where you want to be buying these"
"16338340","16344620"," are real investors you have to know that they're trying to buy this you have to know that they've"
"16344620","16350940"," got they've already got orders in give me a bad a bad reading so that i can buy uh i"
"16350940","16361540"," can buy the pump show 105.55 i mean this is literally where they are to buy crazy"
"16361540","16372680"," right they want to buy this too um insane i know it's insane 9659"
"16379630","16384050"," they're just begging to buy down here i promise you a bull will buy any of this they're like come"
"16384050","16387849"," on come on come on and the people that are holding this know that they'll chase if they don't get"
"16387849","16399790"," it into the into their um er now the implied move on amazon is uh 1 18 86 docker"
"16401930","16408270"," that it's right where i had the line before and then the implied move on the downside is uh 102"
"16408270","16419009"," 13 oh yeah that's the sweet spot this is where the bulls want it i'm going"
"16419009","16428360"," to expect at this point for amazon to sell off you want my personal take"
"16428360","16437990"," i think"
"16437990","16451490"," amazon sells off on this er and i'm going"
"16451490","16458009"," to think that it's uh funds that want a better price for the next move amazon's a great ticker to"
"16458009","16469550"," like trade buy trade buy trade i"
"16469550","16472890"," know for sure that there are people out there that want to buy this the only difference i would"
"16472890","16478830"," give you on this one that it might not come down is uh knowing that there's buyers down here if"
"16478830","16490200"," amazon has a great earnings it could blast off let me look at this here look"
"16490200","16496700"," at that see it just begging to buy this they're just begging i promise they're begging down here to"
"16496700","16507380"," buy this 100 percent now google gaps down"
"16507380","16519070"," below and google goog baby we i"
"16519070","16529050"," know the arguments behind google 1 12 19 right there"
"16529050","16539270"," oh yeah that's a bad sign right there with that that red line right there 138"
"16544550","16554270"," okay i think i'm going to buy some puts into this er i have this sneaking suspicion that all these"
"16554270","16561830"," guys want money they want to buy google right now they'll make any excuse up to sell it that's what"
"16561830","16571759"," i think all that sympathy pump that we got on earnings and stuff i think it has"
"16571759","16578060"," more to do with uh accumulation and distribution to be honest with you okay so um with this right"
"16578060","16587740"," here i'm going to put some buy zones for google 106 88 believe it or not wow yeah they want"
"16587740","16591759"," this too they're gonna they're gonna lie to you i think google is going to be the one where they"
"16591759","16597520"," tell you a bullshit story like microsoft if i had to guess on this one they're going to tell you"
"16597520","16607439"," a lie 103 91 if i had to guess on google er they're"
"16607439","16613180"," going to run a scam story on you and tell you that google is the worst company ever with a"
"16613180","16622619"," 170 and they're going to scoop it up like a"
"16622619","16628860"," larry kudrow type guys get like a new already has a newspaper article done he's gonna be like drop"
"16628860","16639710"," that on fin twitter earnings 96 41 five to guess i'm"
"16639710","16650939"," always trying to think of like people that want to buy buy shit cheap or"
"16650939","16656380"," they create chasers there's the other side of this coin right there already long and they uh they"
"16656380","16660740"," just want you to chase so they can then sell it down on you that's the other thing you got"
"16660740","16666020"," to be afraid of here is that they'll make you chase a good earnings report you chase them and"
"16666020","16673160"," they're selling into you into monday tuesday this is like the these tickers man especially how"
"16673160","16678900"," we've already pumped already um i don't know if i want to trade these today synthetically there's a"
"16678900","16688890"," lot of uh there's a lot of danger here if i had"
"16688890","16698669"," to guess the best trade on paying the synthetically is to look for um the short"
"16698669","16711779"," quite like the the like what has the best chance of working is"
"16711779","16718119"," hoping for like a profit taking up here and then taking a short down into monday so there's my take"
"16718119","16726380"," for google um i think they want it cheaper they might make you a chaser if you're uh if they"
"16726380","16743140"," know people want to buy this crap and uh they'll sell into you above you know"
"16743140","16747939"," i got two harpers uh guess people are buying puts already if you're gonna buy puts on on google too"
"16747939","16752840"," i might wait until we get up here like right at the bell another idea behind this how do you"
"16752840","16759840"," synthetically trade this on spy so we're going to take a look at all four of these that 325 we'll"
"16759840","16763480"," take a look at all four of these but i'll be i'll be honest with you just looking at these"
"16763480","16771880"," right now um just looking at these right now now i come back to the spy right and lo and"
"16771880","16780060"," behold we've got these sellers above right you see what i'm saying so now you come back to the spy"
"16780060","16786260"," and you know that they auto sold this right here you know that they we have an auto short here"
"16786260","16793340"," you know that this was a pretty pretty big sell down here right so they're unloading i want you to"
"16793340","16801080"," think about this they're unloading onto you into strength right bomo buyers here coming up they"
"16801080","16804980"," just straight unload into you right they take their money in the run right you got sellers above"
"16804980","16813480"," just trying to take their money so even if we get a strong ER they're likely setting you up to"
"16813480","16821960"," sell into you take the money and run right so all of these earnings to me look like if i"
"16821960","16827720"," was a bank at least i'd be like yeah this is a great run man and uh j-pow uh"
"16827720","16832820"," j-pow's telling us this is a tradeable market you got mike wilson saying this is the last leg of"
"16832820","16842120"," the bear market blah blah blah if it was me if we were bullish here from now into monday twos"
"16842120","16847820"," they'd be looking to sell this shit down and you get the volatility of uh of non-farm payroll on"
"16847820","16855900"," friday and then you've got cpi next thursday they already know it's going to be good uh i'd be"
"16855900","16865890"," looking a short high up here into the bell be looking to take like a puts on the spies for"
"16865890","16875250"," monday you probably if they if they sell this on the bell here or if somebody if somebody smart"
"16875250","16881130"," grabs some puts up here you probably hear a bunch of bullshit nonsense from bears by next week"
"16881130","16887830"," saying now we're going to crash and it would be awesome because you've got like a storyteller out"
"16887830","16892670"," there trying to push an narrative and meanwhile you're just sitting in puts so i don't know if this"
"16892670","16898930"," plays itself out into the into the end of the day oh yeah nice recovery very our bull's starting to"
"16898930","16904930"," recover um they recovered the one minute the five minute that was very nice recovery for the bulls"
"16905530","16914830"," you've got the pin above right here here's the call pin at 414 417 excuse me yeah 417 I'd be"
"16914830","16921790"," looking to short this shit right at 415 or 405 or whatever above here honestly market needs to cool"
"16921790","16927210"," off man past two or doesn't have to it can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent as a"
"16927210","16932510"," bear but uh i'd be looking up here to take it you can see it they took it above here"
"16932510","16941390"," already they're just waiting up here they're just waiting above here to short it down yeah i would"
"16941390","16948790"," not if you're going to buy calls into the bell i'd be selling them at four at 359 i would"
"16948790","16953610"," not get caught in this and if you or let's say you're like i want to trade the initial rip"
"16953610","16960350"," higher on spy uh i need you to like preset a cell or not you but i would be pre "
"16960350","16969770","-setting a cell here so as an example like if you think we're getting a 416 C's it's probably like"
"16969770","16975570"," a 413 414 and you're looking to make 20 percent the risk reward here is probably not that good"
"16975570","16983650"," right now um the risk reward here is more than likely uh waiting for the for the slam up on"
"16983650","16991690"," the and then selling into it you already know you get sellers here we had known sellers right at"
"16991690","17000510"," 418 31 it's known that they're there known we know already above we've got an auto sell-up 420 so"
"17000510","17009570"," we have an automatic short above so and we know that uh depending upon what what non-farm payroll"
"17009570","17015530"," is and depending upon what cpi is if we're going to hit 420 um you know we got a whole"
"17015530","17020050"," week to get there so if you want full support here you're probably going to be coming down to find"
"17020050","17029970"," it so i think we'll see 3600"
"17029970","17036990"," in the uh next two months yeah i think it's possible i don't think i think we'll have we have"
"17036990","17042590"," a you guys understand some of this stuff right so i was i told somebody else was gonna try"
"17042590","17052950"," explaining this better basically this oh yes that's px okay so i"
"17052950","17059330"," want you to know right i'm gonna make this really short and sweet banks love this kind of motion"
"17059330","17067910"," here okay i like love this kind of stuff fairly marks on closing balance 637 million to the buy"
"17067910","17077190"," side thanks love this shit uh you didn't want real price discovery in the market now sometimes even"
"17077190","17082150"," though we trade like this we'll have one more we go way higher one more we go way lower but"
"17082150","17088450"," they generally like smooth consistent markets and you should too i don't care if you're a bear a"
"17088450","17094170"," boy should like some consistency to market if you had like true price discovery in tesla you'd"
"17094170","17098630"," probably go to like fucking fifty thousand dollars of share and nobody could afford to buy it and"
"17098630","17104050"," so because they can't trade it to each each other you get less buyers and then tesla would crash"
"17104050","17110550"," down to zero and start all over again now one of the ways the banks will try to manage the"
"17110550","17118310"," market is with the heads through options right uh now as we trade up here we already know that the"
"17118310","17127170"," the call side for the caller is done at 406 it will limit our ability to get higher it's almost"
"17127170","17133650"," like a fleet or like a grind that happens if we get call expansion now the moment that call"
"17133650","17139130"," expansion ends we'll start to drift lower right if you get more than the money calls we'll start if"
"17139130","17148770"," we have a magnet down below at 3600 right here it's trying to pull us back down now dpm"
"17148770","17157210"," doesn't care if we go higher because they have now have free puts so if the puts print they make"
"17157210","17163750"," more money if the puts don't print they own the underlying so if we go up they're still making"
"17163750","17168270"," money does that make sense so it really doesn't matter to jpm at this point where we go though"
"17168270","17174070"," there is a magnet down here dpm doesn't want to see us go like straight up we saw that right"
"17174070","17180970"," we saw dumb money take over and in them in the in the crash in april of 2020 and uh"
"17180970","17185370"," you know they don't want to see a market that goes crazy high like straight vertical for a straight"
"17185370","17191090"," year they don't want to see that they're like consistent returns for their for their clients you"
"17191090","17196090"," don't want to go if i'm trying this is a real basic concept if i'm trying to tell you the"
"17196090","17204150"," captain jim james um uh fund right like the 401 the captain jim james 401k i don't want to present"
"17204150","17208910"," to you that one year i made 300 percent the next year i made minus 250 percent and then the"
"17208910","17215150"," next year i made 10 percent they want to be like yeah i make 20 percent consistent every year one"
"17215150","17219850"," year every 10 i get a bad year one year or two years i get a really kick ass here"
"17219850","17227290"," just consistency returns um so can we trade down to 360 was the question sure we can trade we can"
"17227290","17232690"," even pin the 360 in the end of the month or end of the quarter uh it's how we get"
"17232690","17239990"," there that's important and we need to get some push off not on these lines right here we need to"
"17239990","17247170"," get some push off on the danger of a market crash um so if you want my take on coming"
"17247170","17255370"," at 360 sure today do we get 360 more than likely not they need some push off on on uh"
"17255370","17261470"," some momentum or some really dangerous stuff down below you can go back into this morning's uh"
"17261470","17266610"," video and see what i'm talking about i think i spent like a half an hour don't watch the first"
"17266610","17271390"," half of the video i'm actually gonna cut that out or delete it because i've got a little emotional"
"17271390","17278070"," there for a minute because uh this for me this was a big trade down here and uh it was"
"17278070","17284690"," very stressful to take this trade down here i'm not gonna lie this part right here specifically was"
"17284690","17290650"," was extremely stressful for me at least i was under a lot of duress in this trade uh i was"
"17290650","17297870"," under a lot of duress buying this and uh it's it's not fun buying a bottom it's very difficult and"
"17297870","17305290"," uh anyways i'll leave it at that so can we get to 360 down here uh sure is it guaranteed"
"17305290","17311890"," no is there a magnet there yes is there a magnet on keeping us from going too high yes but"
"17311890","17317390"," if we get bulls coming in this market it it didn't help the jpm pace the other day to get"
"17317390","17327390"," mike wilson saying this is the last leg that that shit fucked up jpm uh did drum"
"17327390","17334430"," powley yesterday also did not do a good job for that magnet down below and you start to invite"
"17334430","17341530"," buyers into this market even if we're not going to all-time highs it's it tends to grind us higher"
"17341530","17349470"," as they do as the demand kicks in like the fair losing out uh the jpm 460 gets less and"
"17349470","17354370"," less probable like there can be an argument from bears that they're just looking for bag holders up"
"17354370","17363590"," here to sell into even if they do where's bottom like we're back to 360 again back to 3000 it"
"17363590","17369590"," doesn't it doesn't it's not really um i promise you at this point go back and watch the video from"
"17369590","17376490"," this morning look at what i just showed you on on uh the price on amazon it's a it's a"
"17376490","17383210"," no lose situation basically for buying this market unless you have mike bear berry and we blast"
"17383210","17391110"," down to 1600 next week i can't invest or trade to that i'm sorry uh i i would never i"
"17391110","17395730"," would never it would be like 30 years i'd be like 80 years old by the time i got a"

"19424780","19426700"," Coming right back down looking for demand. "
"19428060","19431260"," We're going to look at Tesla on another chart real quick and we're going to get right back to"
"19431260","19431480"," earnings."
"19431480","19432080"," Hold on here."
"19435680","19436940"," Just unloading bags. "
"19437560","19441220"," This morning we talked about how people are going to take profit into Friday, right?"
"19442040","19443900"," Let's look at Tesla down here."
"19444620","19450340"," I want you to be aware of Tesla into next week, what you don't want to see here in Tesla,"
"19451160","19454680"," you don't want to see us trade down to 150 here, right?"
"19454820","19457220"," I told you if we break 150, it's bad news."
"19457860","19461740"," We don't want to break 183, 182, 63. "
"19462500","19463740"," We don't want to break it, right?"
"19463920","19469300"," If we break it and look for new support down here, this is the last bull case for bulls at"
"19469300","19469540"," 150."
"19470380","19477600"," Currently trading 184, that would leave a 34 point dump below on Tesla."
"19479560","19481460"," This is where people take profit, right?"
"19481980","19486120"," We got 134, 154, you can see it right here, right?"
"19487320","19488640"," Or hold on a second here. "
"19489160","19490000"," Come up, right?"
"19490400","19490880"," Hold on here."
"19492480","19501060"," Sell, hit the price target, bounce, bounce, and you're looking for at least 150 to get bought down"
"19501060","19501260"," there."
"19502080","19508520"," Anything down below is a resumption of the downtrend bear town on Tesla. "
"19509420","19512700"," If you want to know what I think about Tesla, I don't think it blood baths."
"19512920","19515920"," I think we come down, have some weakness and come right back up here."
"19516460","19518040"," I don't think we're done with Tesla. "
"19519460","19520980"," Yeah, but this is where it is."
"19520980","19522480"," This is where the trading range is on Tesla."
"19522480","19524160"," So we're going to go next to Google. "
"19525120","19529760"," Ah, shit, I just heard of the goog, the goog, baby."
"19530700","19532900"," And look at Google, shocker."
"19534280","19536560"," Talked about this, right?"
"19537120","19544480"," You hit your price target, they sell into you, start to sell down where known buyers are on, Google"
"19544480","19546580"," didn't matter what their earnings were. "
"19546740","19548700"," I'm going to assume that Apple's selling off already."
"19548700","19549260"," I haven't checked."
"19549920","19551580"," But that's what it looks like, right?"
"19551900","19554620"," You sell into strength, come back down here. "
"19554900","19559560"," You know you got FOMO buyers all lined up down here to buy, they don't care."
"19560520","19561600"," People do not care."
"19561820","19565140"," If you're a bull, you're like, if you're a bull, you're like, get Google down here. "
"19565320","19568840"," Get down down here in a second, hold it at $97, right?"
"19569060","19570040"," So that's what they're doing, right?"
"19570260","19571360"," You can see it down below."
"19571780","19574400"," They're looking to buy this dip down here for the next leg up."
"19575160","19576800"," We're going to check on Apple real quick. "
"19577480","19580040"," Let's check on, hold on a second here, Apple."
"19582380","19585360"," And that's in eight minutes, we'll get Apple."
"19587400","19588900"," What do you think happens here?"
"19590220","19591920"," What do you think the move is here, right?"
"19592900","19598140"," They blast Apple up, they take the money up and come right back down, looking for new buyers. "
"19600060","19600860"," Makes sense?"
"19610320","19620200"," Yeah, I think they report at, I think Apple reports at 4.20. T-up had like a"
"19620200","19625680"," hole, they didn't even sing it or they get a copyright strike up by sing it."
"19627480","19629060"," Don't watch Apple real quick."
"19629580","19632760"," I'm going to jump back and forth between Apple and Spy. "
"19634820","19636680"," We're going to look at Spy real quick."
"19637260","19640020"," Spy now selling off, teed right up, right?"
"19640500","19642760"," Bam, that's our first level right there."
"19643380","19645760"," First level right here was, hey, take some puts. "
"19646400","19647880"," Add some puts up here."
"19650100","19652480"," All right, definitely not the call side on this trade."
"19652940","19654120"," Definitely on the put side, right?"
"19654920","19657240"," And what are we talking about for tomorrow, right?"
"19657400","19658840"," We got low VIX right now. "
"19659000","19660420"," We got to get some VIX going, right?"
"19660980","19662740"," Gotta get that bear music going."
"19666100","19668500"," Not only get some bear, we got to get a bottom to buy."
"19668500","19669280"," You're a bull. "
"19670060","19674140"," You want to buy a dip and feel good about it, right?"
"19674800","19677680"," So for the next couple of days, what are you looking for?"
"19678080","19681220"," You're like, I don't care if these FOMO guys come up here and do this."
"19681960","19683920"," I care about this down here, baby."
"19684360","19686380"," I want to buy this on Monday or Tuesday. "
"19686600","19688820"," I want to come in to CPI next week on Thursday."
"19689420","19690740"," Heck, I'll be honest with you."
"19690940","19691460"," I'm a bull. "
"19691780","19694380"," So what do I need for Thursday or Thursday or Friday?"
"19695060","19697180"," It's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday."
"19697180","19700340"," So what are you going to expect until next week if I'm not here tomorrow?"
"19701100","19703320"," Oh, yeah, baby, right there is what I'm expecting."

"19757360","19757660"," That's fine."
"19758800","19763860"," I assure you that I'm hoping and begging that they are selling into you. "
