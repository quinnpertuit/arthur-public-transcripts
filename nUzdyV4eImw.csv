"61540","62800"," Check one, two, my check. "
"63200","69280"," Check one, two, my check."
"70020","71020"," We live right now."
"85230","86490"," You guys can see it, right?"
"90110","90730"," All right. "
"95130","96330"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"96350","96950"," Good morning."
"98790","102940"," I'm calling you saying no. "
"104760","106100"," You can't see the street."
"106300","107000"," You can't see the street."
"117080","120240"," TQQ, it's Tesla. "
"120760","121460"," We'll talk to Tesla today."
"131630","136220"," TQQ, Tesla, because people are sassy about it."
"137060","138000"," They're all speaking smart. "
"138700","140200"," I don't even know what that one is."
"142300","142860"," Let's get ready."
"143060","144060"," Oh, you know, we'll get into this morning. "
"144320","144960"," Good morning."
"145120","146040"," How are you all doing out there?"
"146680","147740"," Let's get right into the market briefly."
"147920","149940"," I'm going to make it really fast here because I am late this morning. "
"156100","161600"," So we're going to start this morning with, by the way, good morning."
"161600","165860"," So I'm having some issues this morning, but it's not just myself."
"166760","169580"," I'm actually on a friend's website right now. "
"169580","170800"," It is down."
"171040","172280"," I haven't checked in the past few minutes."
"172700","178280"," And even our website is experiencing some server side issues this morning. "
"178720","182360"," So I want you to know that I'm having troubles logging into the stream lab server."
"182940","185820"," And then I'm also having some issues on our website."
"186480","187820"," And there are some other web. "
"187920","188960"," I don't know if you have any other websites."
"188960","191780"," You've tried to check this morning, but there are some other issues out there."
"191960","198000"," I don't know if it's nationwide or just regional or whatever, but I apologize to you for not being"
"198000","198740"," here this morning. "
"200300","202200"," I'm like, yeah, I'm just going to hang out over here."
"202320","202920"," Wait a minute."
"203220","204820"," I got to give me one quick second here. "
"213480","214020"," I'll be right."
"214220","215580"," I'm going to put it on the main screen, guys."
"215780","216260"," Hold on one second. "
"216320","217480"," I'm talking to a dev right now."
"218580","745180"," In Jewish"
"745180","751320"," official in government said moments ago on the Senate floor that he believes Prime Minister"
"751320","755960"," Benjamin Netanyahu has lost his way in the Israeli bombardment of Gaza."
"756640","762800"," The most significant criticism made by a U.S. leader since Israel's war with Hamas began last"
"762800","763300"," October. "
"763940","771420"," A suspected tornado touched down in Kansas last night as severe storms and large hail pelted the"
"771420","771660"," region."
"771660","776000"," The National Weather Service is sending out teams this morning to assess the damage."
"776420","781060"," But meteorologists say the suspected twisters, thankfully, mispopulated areas. "
"781580","782940"," No injuries have been reported."
"783880","790680"," And the famed British Airways Concord is returning to its home today at the Intrepid Air Museum."
"791240","796960"," The supersonic aircraft, which holds the record for the fastest transatlantic crossing by a"
"796960","802060"," passenger plane, just got a fresh coat of paint and other restoration work in Brooklyn. "
"802560","805860"," It will reopen for tours next month."
"806260","811860"," It's amazing that we used to have that doing transatlantic flights, and we haven't been able to"
"811860","812540"," reproduce it."
"812960","814240"," I was thinking that same thing. "
"814500","816320"," Yeah, hopefully we can sometime."
"816580","819620"," That would be very convenient for many people that do that back and forth."
"819820","820800"," Bertha, thank you. "
"820800","823900"," After the break, Bertha is initiating Robin Hill with a buy."
"824800","827020"," Why is, quote, monster of a crypto cycle?"
"827020","828700"," Is fueling that whole thesis?"
"829400","830060"," We'll be back in two."
"1062360","1066580"," Check out Share's the Under Armour today lower as founder Kevin Plank returns as CEO. "
"1066980","1071500"," Evercourt calls that a clear signal that Under Armour strategy isn't working, downgrading shares to"
"1071500","1072580"," underperform this morning."
"1072580","1077800"," Stock is down 65% since Plank's departure at the end of 2019."
"1078660","1081540"," There have been two CEOs, of course, since Plank was at the helm. "
"1081900","1085440"," So we'll see if he has a new strategy to bring the company that he founded forward."
"1086420","1090540"," Main time Robin Hood jumping this morning after reporting that its assets under custody broke the"
"1090540","1092820"," $100 billion mark for the second consecutive month."
"1093300","1096520"," Our next guest is extremely bullish on the company's crypto prospects. "
"1097180","1099360"," Initiates with the buy today, price target of 30."
"1099520","1101280"," That's more than 70% upside."
"1101280","1103480"," The analyst behind that call joins us this morning. "
"1103620","1104320"," Bernstein's got him."
"1104520","1105320"," Chugani, got him."
"1105380","1106120"," It's great to have you. "
"1106220","1108960"," It's taken a couple of years to get from 7 to 18."
"1109700","1111460"," What needs to change to get to 30?"
"1112760","1113160"," Yeah."
"1113400","1115600"," So I think obviously the last two years were pretty challenging. "
"1116100","1121200"," They were kind of dealing with the sort of the active traders receding and sort of focus more on"
"1121200","1124120"," the asset side, which is why you see the asset side of the business pick up."
"1124500","1127380"," The interest revenues have kind of become almost more than 50%."
"1127380","1132420"," I think what we expect now is more risk on side of the market to kind of turn on. "
"1132560","1134660"," And I think crypto is going to be a big part of that."
"1134980","1140980"," We obviously expect the crypto market to triple from here to almost $7.500 in terms of total market"
"1140980","1141340"," cap."
"1141900","1148480"," And given obviously, Robin Hood is among the few brokers who provide a full suite crypto platform. "
"1149180","1153860"," We expect that the flexibility to kind of kick in the jet sort of crypto revenue is inflecting"
"1153860","1154620"," almost nine times."
"1154620","1159660"," So yes, it's been two years, I think, of a fairly challenging period."
"1160020","1166040"," Given, you know, we went to a fairly 24 high in the race and, you know, the overall risk"
"1166040","1167060"," environment was very different. "
"1167780","1171520"," Going forward, we think crypto is going to lead that charge in terms of its transaction revenues"
"1171520","1172260"," inflecting."
"1172840","1175520"," And I think that's what takes it for the from here."
"1175800","1183280"," So it sounds like from a from an asset deployment perspective, equities of 41 is pretty nice year"
"1183280","1185740"," on year, but crypto is something entirely new. "
"1185900","1190380"," I mean, we should just back up and talk about that $7.5 trillion number that you see."
"1190520","1191800"," That's, that's almost a triple."
"1191960","1192120"," All right. "
"1193320","1193800"," Yeah."
"1194180","1199640"," So I think, you know, where we are, we obviously got the big ETF launch on JAN 10."
"1199700","1206900"," This has been the most successful ETF ever, almost 4% of total Bitcoin supplies now under Bitcoin"
"1206900","1207720"," ETFs. "
"1207720","1209620"," We've having record days every day."
"1209940","1213380"," This is, as I said, part for the most successful ETF launch ever."
"1214060","1215620"," I don't think it just stops there. "
"1215780","1215800"," Right."
"1215960","1220080"," I think the way these asset managers are seeing is they're seeing the full global digital asset"
"1220080","1220960"," management build out."
"1221200","1221260"," Right. "
"1221520","1223820"," So I think we get on to the Ethereum media."
"1224100","1227140"," Soon we can't exactly predict when that's going to happen."
"1227160","1229660"," Obviously, everyone's looking at the May 23rd. "
"1229940","1232960"," But we do think we get any theory of this cycle."
"1232960","1238480"," And then I think it kind of goes on to more interesting things like, you know, broader active"
"1238480","1240620"," products, smart, direct open products and so on so forth."
"1240860","1247180"," So what we project here is something like what is a $50 to $60 billion asset management industry"
"1247180","1250760"," going to $650 billion, which is why you've seen the likes of blackout and fidelity. "
"1251660","1256600"," Snooping in, you know, focusing here in terms of being a fairly strategic priority."
"1256880","1261360"," And I think that's what takes us to that $7.5 trillion number from where we are today."
"1262000","1263580"," What about some of the other broker platforms?"
"1263880","1266580"," I mean, couldn't they also be poised to benefit?"
"1266580","1271980"," If we do see crypto go to $7.5 trillion as a market cap in your estimation?"
"1273380","1275620"," Yeah, but you know, I think it's also about being ready. "
"1275880","1275900"," Right."
"1276160","1280960"," So I think Robinhood is being fairly disruptive in the fact that they've kind of continued with its"
"1280960","1283240"," crypto platform through a very tough time."
"1283620","1287280"," I think there were many broker platforms who were interested but have not really executed on those"
"1287280","1287480"," plans. "
"1288460","1293240"," Also, the fact that, you know, Robinhood's customers are, you know, 11 million active customers."
"1294100","1295040"," They're active traders."
"1295460","1295760"," They are young. "
"1296000","1296500"," They're self-directed."
"1297620","1299380"," They trade equity options, which is the bread and butter."
"1300240","1305340"," So the propensity for that kind of customer base to trade crypto is fairly high because, you know,"
"1305420","1306480"," kind of suits the demographic. "
"1307040","1308760"," So it's a fairly young great of these there."
"1309420","1313900"," I don't think the other broker platforms have that apart from the fact that they don't have the"
"1313900","1316160"," product, which is which is what Robin on offers."
"1317080","1323380"," As for just general retail stock activity, I wonder what do you think the engine is right now"
"1323380","1326160"," that's driving participation inequities?"
"1326720","1329020"," Is it about sort of playing with recent gains?"
"1329380","1335980"," Is it house money effect or are people sort of using excess savings that's left over or just the"
"1335980","1338020"," security of knowing that the job market's good?"
"1338920","1343900"," Yeah, I mean, I don't think I have a very strong perspective from a macro standpoint, but obviously"
"1343900","1345460"," the tech stocks have been pretty strong. "
"1346100","1349720"," They've been kind of offering the volatility, which is important for the options for the club."
"1350460","1355620"," So I think tech and momentum in general has done well on the equity side and then crypto is"
"1355620","1356260"," starting to interact."
"1356980","1361480"," So it kind of suits this customer base, which wants that volatility, which wants to trade options,"
"1361480","1362500"," which wants to create crypto. "
"1362780","1365940"," And I think that's the kind of risk on perspective we're seeing in the market recently."
"1365940","1368880"," Finally, the trajectory of fees."
"1369260","1374960"," I mean, obviously, a lot of the flows that are being driven by ETFs are amid fierce competition to"
"1374960","1375740"," lower fees. "
"1376280","1379500"," When does the environment change to when you can start charging a little bit more for better"
"1379500","1380300"," service, let's say?"
"1381540","1384320"," Yeah, I mean, I think the ETF fees are what they are."
"1384620","1387220"," This is what is happening between the global asset managers."
"1387660","1390980"," I think in general, the fees that would be suppressed on the crypto side. "
"1390980","1392080"," Obviously, you can charge more."
"1392080","1393560"," I mean, people won't break tokens."
"1393560","1396620"," You can charge them 25 basis points, which is what government charges them. "
"1397500","1399260"," But ETFs obviously, I think it's challenging."
"1400460","1404840"," Obviously, you have a scale effect of the big four or the big fire doing better than the remaining."
"1405560","1407520"," And but yes, it's going to be fairly competitive. "
"1407920","1410260"," I think, you know, as I said, this is not just going to stop it."
"1410360","1412240"," But I think it's going to extend to its theme as well."
"1412720","1414080"," There's a lot out there. "
"1414080","1420260"," I mean, if today we are at $2.9 million market cap on crypto, even if, you know, part of"
"1420260","1423560"," that actually goes to the ETFs or or a lot of platforms."
"1423960","1425800"," There's a lot of asset accumulation there."
"1425960","1431260"," So I'm not surprised that we're seeing a bit of this sort of beef or going on because there's a"
"1431260","1431800"," lot at stake. "
"1432680","1437200"," Finally, I really quick, no chance you think we ever get to the 21 highs, right?"
"1437340","1438600"," The $85 price."
"1440700","1442860"," I don't think we have a $30 target price."
"1443280","1447500"," I wouldn't really say that we are getting into the 2021 markets. "
"1447740","1449020"," I think this market is very healthy."
"1449400","1452460"," I think this is being driven by institutional flows, at least on the crypto side."
"1453320","1458140"," So, yeah, I mean, I think the prospects of, you know, often we're becoming an investor favorite"
"1458140","1458520"," again. "
"1458600","1460800"," All right."
"1461000","1461240"," Good morning."
"1461480","1462900"," I apologize to you at the moment. "
"1464220","1466520"," Well, let's say I got some stuff I got to do here."
"1468640","1469620"," Right over there."
"1469780","1470360"," I think that's right. "
"1472000","1472860"," Good morning."
"1474700","1476380"," One is the stream being in."
"1476560","1476900"," Are you guys?"
"1477060","1478400"," You guys are getting interruptions, right?"
"1478620","1480100"," I got to tell you guys something right now. "
"1480520","1483480"," I don't believe it's on my side."
"1484100","1487020"," We're having, we're having server issues on our website."
"1487860","1491800"," And we're having server issues from stream labs. "
"1492240","1496360"," And then I have a friend this morning with his own website and it's completely down."
"1497220","1499440"," So I think that it's, yeah, good morning."
"1499560","1500020"," How are y'all doing?"
"1500540","1506340"," I don't think that it's anything that I'm doing or anything that we're doing on our end. "
"1506540","1510820"," So only because there's a third party that is a third party out there that I'm friends with that"
"1510820","1512360"," his site is down this morning as well."
"1513000","1515820"," I don't know if you're experiencing it anywhere else in the US."
"1516160","1519540"," I tried to reset my router three or four times this morning. "
"1519780","1521480"," I have fiber internet."
"1522240","1526320"," And the response from stream labs was that it was server side, not my side."
"1526740","1526740"," So. "
"1527860","1529400"," Good morning to all of you out there."
"1529480","1530000"," Good to see everybody."
"1530500","1531440"," How are y'all doing, by the way?"
"1532900","1534560"," So let's let's have a talk here. "
"1534640","1539220"," What we're going to do is we're going to look at a few things and do an update on yesterday's"
"1539220","1539440"," stream."
"1539440","1544740"," And then this morning what's taking place in the function of what's taking place this morning when"
"1544740","1546420"," I get all of you caught up to speed."
"1546960","1552080"," So the first thing that we're going to do is I'm going to show you guys the post that was"
"1552080","1552420"," on. "
"1553460","1555140"," Well, we'll talk about a bunch of stuff."
"1555300","1555920"," Give me one quick second."
"1556040","1557180"," Let me check some seven. "
"1557340","1561860"," I want to catch every speed because I'm sure I'm sure that some of you are like, I wasn't here"
"1561860","1562300"," yesterday."
"1563080","1564820"," I don't know what you're talking about."
"1565960","1567960"," And I'm sure some of you were here yesterday. "
"1568780","1571320"," And it was a problem because I was on Twitter and I'm like."
"1572160","1576160"," I'm like, you had to kind of enter the role yesterday."
"1577180","1579100"," Take the trade down, take the trade up. "
"1579240","1582740"," And then even this morning on the open, you were up."
"1583180","1587980"," You were up today perfectly and you expected the role down, not as deep as it went."
"1588380","1589720"," And that there's a reason for that. "
"1590020","1591580"," We'll talk about that today as well."
"1591580","1596320"," And there's a reason for that because you need the high volume to come in."
"1596560","1600960"," We had the high volume come in yesterday at the close, but not the high volume come in on the"
"1600960","1602480"," open this morning. "
"1603020","1608640"," And that impact, do you open the wall above the ping ponging effect?"
"1609280","1613220"," Now any of you that are a subscriber or a pro trainer have access to all this shit on the"
"1613220","1614020"," website, right?"
"1614400","1615700"," So I'm going to show this to the public."
"1616440","1621020"," I'm going to show Paul Whiz and what he admits the statements that he had made and the trades that"
"1621020","1621440"," we took."
"1621700","1625200"," So if you're in the trades, you're in all the trades in the beginning, you're fine. "
"1625460","1626740"," You're fine on the open this morning."
"1627120","1632740"," You were looking for a dip to buy this morning, either off the hourly trigger or lower or whatever."
"1633380","1637900"," So we're going to start at square one though because I think there's, and then of course I'm like"
"1637900","1641760"," on Twitter going, yeah, this and that and people are like, what the fuck is that guy talking about?"
"1642260","1646440"," Even the post yesterday when I was like, were you all on the stream?"
"1646440","1647860"," People didn't understand. "
"1648160","1650540"," They're just like, who is he talking to and what does he mean?"
"1651440","1654200"," And then I made another post yesterday saying, get out of the way."
"1654380","1655900"," You've got like, get out of the way."
"1656740","1658220"," You're going to get run over. "
"1658580","1662540"," And the reason you're going to get run over is because of the volume trade that came in at the"
"1662540","1666140"," bell that we were looking for yesterday as well."
"1666400","1670520"," So like when we bounced yesterday, we were looking for that volume coming in."
"1670520","1676960"," And we were looking for that volume again this morning on the open to see if that would, that you"
"1676960","1677780"," would get that continuation. "
"1678300","1681280"," So I'm going to explain the mechanics of the trade right now."
"1681360","1686620"," We're going to start at square one for anyone that was not here or not on Twitter or wherever."
"1687300","1692120"," So I had people like, I've been getting blown up like DMS blowing up. "
"1692280","1694520"," You name it blown up like, what the fuck is going on?"
"1694520","1695960"," And I'm like, it's not really me."
"1696200","1697080"," It was explained to me."
"1697680","1700760"," And we just talked about yesterday and it started happening. "
"1701240","1703000"," So we're going to look at that right now."
"1703200","1704600"," So first off, good morning, everybody."
"1704840","1705520"," Good to see you. "
"1705820","1706300"," Apologize."
"1706660","1713840"," If you were having any service interruption this morning, either on Discord or on the website or"
"1713840","1715820"," even here watching me on stream, I apologize."
"1716340","1718620"," It's not something that's from me. "
"1718700","1720560"," So I apologize to you this morning."
"1720640","1721340"," So let's get started."
"1722180","1723120"," I'll give you a second. "
"1723240","1727300"," I'm going to set this up for you so you can start from square one from yesterday."
"1727420","1727880"," Okay."
"1728460","1730540"," So number one, but in good morning. "
"1730780","1731720"," Dude, guess what?"
"1734700","1742100"," Dude, any of you guys that have been here since the beginning, I don't know if I can tell you"
"1742100","1747760"," who followed that trade from like the roll down and the up and then even into the open this"
"1747760","1748000"," morning."
"1748760","1753420"," One of our, I'm not going to say who he is, but you were a long time follower."
"1754220","1756680"," One of our favorite people here, right?"
"1756960","1758340"," That we haven't seen in a while. "
"1758820","1761100"," He was in that trade and he did very well."
"1761340","1761420"," So."
"1762920","1767260"," So if he's out there right now, I'm sorry, I can't respond anymore this morning, but I love you,"
"1767380","1767440"," man. "
"1767940","1769160"," So hold on one second."
"1769160","1772760"," We're going to go through all of this right now and have a little chat about it and the"
"1772760","1775920"," implications on today and where we are right now because this is important."
"1776720","1781160"," For today where we are, where we're going, where we likely end up at the end of the day and"
"1781160","1785480"," what the impact is tomorrow as well and how that trade has been formulated. "
"1786740","1790900"," So give me one quick second here and let me one quick second here and we got to talk about"
"1790900","1791240"," that trade."
"1791400","1792240"," What do we name that trade?"
"1792900","1794960"," And I think Val Wiz might have named it."
"1795060","1797420"," So we're going to go through it and look at it one more time here. "
"1798480","1799680"," To me, one quick second."
"1799800","1800380"," I got a couple of things."
"1800620","1802320"," Dude, it's so fucking hot here. "
"1802660","1803860"," I need to put in here."
"1804000","1805680"," I'm not a fan on."
"1806000","1809880"," I have a C in this room and I built this room, right?"
"1811040","1813620"," And it still doesn't, it can't dispense. "
"1813840","1817800"," Once it's not cold outside, this room is like blast and heat."
"1818580","1821260"," So I put a fan on in this room."
"1821840","1823800"," Anyways, sorry, that's a side. "
"1823940","1825700"," I'm getting sidetracked at the moment."
"1825700","1829280"," So number one, we're going to look at this right here."
"1830100","1831720"," We're going to take a look at this right here. "
"1831840","1832420"," Hold on a second."
"1832560","1833640"," It's a really cool shit, right?"
"1835080","1837660"," This is the one that this is the part that pisses me off to."
"1838100","1840000"," It's a five leg trade. "
"1841540","1843860"," The first three legs have been perfect."
"1844980","1847500"," The last two legs, right?"
"1848820","1849880"," Well, I got to take this."
"1850080","1851820"," Dude, this is more server shit. "
"1851960","1853020"," Hold on one second."
"1853520","1855160"," I'm sorry I have to do this to you."
"1855300","1855920"," Hold on one second. "
"4187750","4188850"," All right, here we go."
"4188970","4189330"," Back again."
"4189750","4191630"," Oh, dude, this is nightmare fuel. "
"4193670","4195070"," This is pure nightmare fuel."
"4198230","4199090"," All right, let me go back."
"4199310","4199930"," I bet you everybody's not. "
"4200050","4201290"," I don't but nobody's even here anymore."
"4204530","4205390"," Well, I was here."
"4206050","4207470"," Beat that right there. "
"4207890","4208910"," Beat that right there."
"4209470","4211270"," I'm like, you got to be kidding me."
"4214290","4215010"," All right. "
"4216750","4218050"," You getting murdered out here?"
"4220250","4222190"," Okay, thanks for sticking around."
"4222390","4224270"," I apologize for the delay once more."
"4224790","4228350"," Dude, this morning is not going the way that I want it to go. "
"4229070","4233450"," All right, let's get back to the conversation that I started with you earlier."
"4237950","4239950"," Let me give you a quick second."
"4240090","4241230"," I'll bring this up for you right now. "
"4241390","4244130"," I'm going to go to exactly where we began yesterday."
"4245230","4249710"," So yesterday in the afternoon, I believe it was about one o'clock in the afternoon, one 30."
"4250150","4257730"," I was taking an afternoon break from the stream and I said to the show audience, let me come back"
"4257730","4258170"," to the minute. "
"4258590","4261150"," I'm going to see if I can have something for you."
"4261690","4264130"," So the first thing I did was I contacted Scott."
"4264410","4268990"," I was like, Hey, we're going to talk to Scott and see if this makes sense to me. "
"4269170","4270850"," And if I'm getting this right or wrong."
"4272170","4275110"," And so he was like, I got, I called him a phone like three times."
"4275250","4276450"," I'm like, Hey man, I want to talk to you. "
"4276490","4278490"," I just want to confirm, make sure that I have this correct."
"4279350","4281910"," And so he discussed it with me yesterday afternoon."
"4282590","4284450"," And I want it to be clear on it, right?"
"4284690","4287330"," So, but then I came back to the show yesterday afternoon. "
"4288330","4290750"," And let me take a look at this right here."
"4293570","4294130"," Hold on."
"4294270","4295310"," This is an VDA. "
"4297370","4302790"," So I want to show you right here."
"4303010","4304010"," This is where we started yesterday."
"4304770","4306910"," So gather around again. "
"4309430","4310190"," Oh, wait a minute."
"4310190","4311090"," I got one more thing I'm going to bring up."
"4311150","4315030"," I want to show you guys what I posted on the website last night, right?"
"4315170","4319190"," On my website or not mine, but trade the trigger website last night, right?"
"4320290","4323490"," So let me type one second here. "
"4325630","4327170"," I should say Aaron's website."
"4329550","4331030"," Hold on a second here."
"4332450","4333530"," So I've got. "
"4335630","4336630"," Let me see here."
"4337410","4340210"," Let me go to the dashboard, visit site."
"4342870","4344110"," Well, come on now. "
"4344670","4345210"," There we go."
"4346010","4346350"," All right."
"4351510","4352950"," Why is this not up here?"
"4355490","4357370"," Did I not put the keys on there?"
"4357710","4359990"," Oops, I must have, maybe I forgot to put the keys on last night. "
"4359990","4362670"," I think I may have forgot to put the keys on last night."
"4362750","4363930"," That's how tired it was last night."
"4365550","4366050"," That's okay. "
"4366350","4366890"," It doesn't matter."
"4367190","4369270"," So the idea here is this."
"4371090","4374330"," I get on to the, I'm going to show it on the bottom, I think. "
"4374630","4377790"," I think the best way to show this is in the bottom so we can keep the price up on"
"4377790","4378130"," the screen."
"4380250","4383770"," So yesterday at one, about one o'clock in the afternoon, one 30 in the afternoon, we were wondering"
"4383770","4384530"," where we were headed."
"4384930","4387050"," We're going to go up or we're going to go down. "
"4387510","4389330"," There was a lot of questioning of this, right?"
"4389610","4390810"," And yesterday is a stream."
"4391030","4392010"," So we're going to go over here yesterday."
"4393210","4395350"," We'll leave this up, but just right in here. "
"4396670","4400050"," And there was about one, what's this 230 right here?"
"4400310","4404530"," So I think we started to, let me go over to a, this might be the best way to do"
"4404530","4404650"," it."
"4404710","4404930"," Hold on."
"4405930","4407450"," So right about here, right?"
"4409250","4412190"," I think it was like right in here, somewhere in here, somewhere in here. "
"4412810","4419870"," So just generally speaking, right here."
"4421750","4427290"," The question was, are we going to be able to break up into the end of the day or into"
"4427290","4427690"," Friday?"
"4428710","4430770"," We had a nice little consolidation right here, right?"
"4430950","4433270"," We had this, let's go to white here."
"4434070","4435770"," This looks like a bull flag, right?"
"4436170","4436810"," Everything looks good. "
"4436930","4442070"," If you're a traditional trader, anything like that, not having any of this information over here,"
"4442590","4446670"," you got to remember that there was no information over here, right?"
"4447030","4447670"," That's all there was."
"4448690","4455970"," So this was gone and it's like, hey, are we going to come down here and break higher or not?"
"4456210","4460750"," Now, David AMS, we're going to squeeze up, right?"
"4460890","4466550"," I think David AMS at that point was in the discord saying there's danger here."
"4467490","4469390"," I think I might be wrong on that. "
"4469510","4470230"," Don't hold me to that."
"4470390","4475310"," But I think I was reading in the discord yesterday, him saying, no, no, no, this is bad danger into"
"4475310","4475870"," the end of the day."
"4476470","4479350"," Now, I didn't know that at the time, but none of us did. "
"4479610","4481070"," So we started talking about this."
"4482150","4483570"," And I was like, I'm going to come back to my break."
"4483590","4487570"," I'm going to show you guys something on the stream. "
"4487830","4490330"," So it took a break, Tuck Scott, come back to the stream yesterday."
"4492090","4499070"," And Scott had made a, Scott has a sub stack and a newsletter and him and our friends like, we're"
"4499070","4502270"," like close personal friends outside of Ben Twitt."
"4502950","4504250"," He's a very smart guy. "
"4504330","4507390"," This guy is like, this guy went to like best schools for finance."
"4508170","4514570"," He says he, a lot of our conversations revolve around like a conversation with Andy Constin or a"
"4514570","4521030"," conversation with any of the people out there that have conversations like robot James the E."
"4521190","4522150"," Plur, what's this guy's name?"
"4522290","4524690"," E Plur 666 or 696 or whatever."
"4525230","4527370"," Like you talk to these guys and they're very smart. "
"4528090","4529750"," These are the guys that run the basement."
"4530230","4531150"," They're like Bob in the basement."
"4531470","4532290"," These guys run everything. "
"4532690","4534490"," These guys scour everything."
"4534910","4537270"," They won't look for anything that's unusual in the marketplace."
"4539050","4543930"," Specifically, Val Wiz like pays very close attention to the market. "
"4544870","4547290"," And a lot of times we don't know what's going on in the market, right?"
"4547430","4548070"," We assign things."
"4548070","4549190"," This is for that reason."
"4549370","4550330"," This is for that reason. "
"4550430","4551430"," All that kind of stuff."
"4553090","4555510"," And Scott, I'm going to show this to you right now."
"4555590","4558990"," Scott had noted that he's been saying this for some time. "
"4559150","4559390"," Now hold on."
"4559490","4561630"," Let's go back to the main screen."
"4563090","4564970"," And let me move this over, I guess. "
"4565150","4565930"," Maybe I'll just move this over."
"4568880","4570860"," I'm going to leave it down here below for you."
"4570960","4571080"," Okay. "
"4572160","4574100"," On the downside screen here."
"4574400","4579180"," And so the reason that he's been saying this too, he's been saying this for years actually."
"4579820","4585580"," Whenever we come into like a Vixpiration or we come into an Op-X, there are some patterns that"
"4585580","4588020"," emerge in those periods. "
"4588840","4595120"," There's a lot of manipulation that can take place into Op-X periods, Vixpiration periods."
"4595120","4601020"," And a lot of traders are left with traders, investors that are always scared, right?"
"4601200","4601580"," Even bears."
"4601900","4602640"," I mean, it's not just bulls. "
"4603240","4604040"," It bears and bulls."
"4604400","4605080"," They get scared."
"4605640","4610800"," Because you know you could be in a position, an underlying position, you could be short, maybe a"
"4610800","4617460"," futures trader, a Globex trader, and everything is supposed to operate as normal, yet it does not,"
"4617740","4617860"," right?"
"4618380","4620960"," So you can get trapped and really hurt in these periods. "
"4620960","4628300"," So if you have a quarter and it begins in your first two weeks, let's say, of that quarter, you"
"4628300","4635540"," have people that actually have an impact in the market making decisions on investments on direction"
"4635540","4639840"," of markets and what they do has sway over a quarter."
"4640660","4641080"," All right."
"4641760","4647920"," Now, as we come into the end of that quarter, those same people are looking to take profit off of"
"4647920","4648920"," these quarterly trades. "
"4648920","4654760"," And along the way in that quarter, they also place more trades that accumulate into the end of that"
"4654760","4655020"," quarter."
"4655280","4660980"," You even know about the JPM caller quarterly, but there's also smaller collars as we move through"
"4660980","4661380"," that quarter."
"4661720","4665300"," They adjust their plans so that they don't go bankrupt, right?"
"4665960","4666780"," There's hedge funds. "
"4666980","4669540"," There's high net worth individuals, all these people."
"4669800","4677160"," And it all trickles down to everybody following, to some extent, oftentimes those perceptions of"
"4677160","4677660"," where we're going ahead."
"4678320","4683460"," So at any rate, he made a note and he says in this note, he goes, can I know about"
"4683460","4684280"," this stuff that he does?"
"4684460","4689800"," I'm like, and I'm like, you know, he's got something that I read the other day related to op X,"
"4689920","4690140"," right?"
"4690760","4694700"," And you guys are always looking for some kind of insight into that, right?"
"4694920","4696020"," Like, can we get some insight?"
"4696660","4697840"," And is anyone discussing this?"
"4698000","4700300"," And nobody is or was discussing this?"
"4700980","4702340"," I don't see it out there. "
"4702380","4704480"," There's a few people like Jedi knows about it."
"4704540","4707320"," There's a few other SPX spaz trader."
"4707660","4709260"," There's like a group of like 10 guys. "
"4709840","4714420"," But know about this stuff, care about this stuff, pay attention to it, watch it closely in the"
"4714420","4714700"," background."
"4715520","4715600"," So."
"4717360","4719680"," He wrote lastly look out. "
"4719940","4721960"," I want you to look at this specific thing right here."
"4721960","4731260"," And in this note, he wrote, lastly keep on the lookout period for op X Thursday and spy X div."
"4732160","4733560"," It is notorious. "
"4734560","4735560"," Like it is notorious."
"4737480","4743920"," And the div capture trades spur demand for spy Thursday expiration calls."
"4745900","4753600"," To rest spy from unsuspecting overwriters and collect the dividend. "
"4755500","4758320"," From the March 4th note, right?"
"4758860","4760440"," And this is from the March 4th note."
"4760620","4762200"," He wrote the last few quarters."
"4762300","4764660"," This trade has been going bananas. "
"4765520","4767060"," All volume has exploded."
"4767640","4768940"," He's going to make this bigger here."
"4770500","4771880"," That's a little bit large, isn't it?"
"4773180","4774680"," I think that a little bit small. "
"4776100","4778580"," Last few quarters, this trade has been going bananas."
"4779000","4783500"," Call volume has exploded and has been driving spy SPX through the roof on these Thursdays."
"4783840","4784400"," Here is September. "
"4785200","4788560"," The Fed meeting wasn't during quarterly op op X week though, right?"
"4789700","4793320"," And what you can see here is I'm going to draw this out for you, okay?"
"4794940","4797740"," So this was in comparison historically."
"4798100","4798600"," This was yesterday."
"4800040","4801000"," See my little..."
"4801000","4801980"," Let me see if I make this bigger now. "
"4802180","4802440"," Hold on here."
"4804380","4805280"," Can I make this any bigger?"
"4806520","4806760"," Right there."
"4806900","4807840"," Maybe a little bit more right there. "
"4808760","4809420"," So you can see this."
"4810780","4814380"," And so the price action yesterday was very similar."
"4814900","4815400"," Right?"
"4815500","4816040"," We came up. "
"4816340","4817440"," The price comes up."
"4818320","4819440"," We start to grind."
"4820760","4822140"," And we were like right here. "
"4824420","4828800"," And so I come on the show yesterday and I go, I'm starting explaining this idea."
"4829220","4832560"," So I'm writing calls for you, right?"
"4833540","4834560"," As a market participant."
"4835260","4836180"," And we're next div. "
"4837120","4838660"," I sell you 100 calls."
"4840460","4843660"," And I own the underlying, right?"
"4843660","4848840"," And I'm going to get a dividend for that at the close of Thursday."
"4852140","4855700"," Now, you see this blasting down action here, right?"
"4856040","4857140"," So we start to discuss yesterday. "
"4857140","4860140"," We're like, well, what if we start selling down into the clothes?"
"4862260","4867340"," When we're right where we are, I'm like, and that sell down into the clothes is going to be"
"4867340","4868000"," vicious."
"4870240","4875160"," So we're talking like, we're going to sell down the clothes and it's going to be a fucking red bar"
"4875160","4875480"," down."
"4876340","4878140"," So we're discussing this yesterday. "
"4880380","4882780"," And people started planning for it."
"4882880","4884320"," Now, I did say to you, don't do this."
"4884460","4885280"," Don't follow this trade. "
"4885420","4886420"," Of course, everybody did."
"4887820","4890300"," And so everybody's maxed out on zero date puts."
"4890640","4891220"," And what do we do?"
"4891220","4892760"," We dropped what?"
"4893040","4894360"," 30 handles, I think. "
"4894600","4896460"," I think we went straight down 30 handles."
"4898020","4900620"," We actually drew out two targets."
"4901520","4903340"," We said that, and the people were like, where are we going to go?"
"4903920","4904820"," And when does it end?"
"4905120","4906600"," Is it to the bell or not to the bell?"
"4906880","4910740"," And you can see in here that there's a green bar right before the close, right here. "
"4911740","4913000"," A little green bar right here."
"4914020","4916120"," And there's high volume into this close."
"4917640","4918780"," Okay, high volume. "
"4921920","4929460"," So in this high volume, right, you'd expect it to stop before the end of the day."
"4929800","4931600"," So let's call it the last hour."
"4932180","4933200"," I should stop. "
"4933640","4935080"," And let's figure out some targets."
"4935680","4937320"," So we draw in on the show yesterday."
"4937880","4938540"," Here's PT one. "
"4938740","4939460"," Here's PT two."
"4940480","4942760"," They're likely going to go all the way down to PT two."
"4942920","4943960"," And earlier in the day. "
"4944860","4949580"," Earlier in the morning or the night before, I was like, well, I'm looking to buy this posted that"
"4949580","4950600"," market brief as well."
"4951000","4953520"," And I'm like, I really want to buy this price down here."
"4953820","4955800"," And we sat up all day long. "
"4956600","4961160"," And so when we drew those those boxes in, one of those boxes was PT two."
"4962100","4964320"," And PT two is where I wanted to be a buyer."
"4965320","4966460"," This is my last known demand. "
"4967100","4968800"," I already know there's volatility in this market."
"4969000","4970880"," And I already know that I'm selling extremes."
"4970880","4976800"," And there's a gamma ping pong area that that's where I want to be a buyer. "
"4977120","4983220"," And anything above that, where that top that top resistance is, I want to be a seller."
"4983960","4987680"," But also knowing that these that there's probably somebody out there."
"4988180","4990640"," I don't know if it's Ackman or Aiken or who it is. "
"4990760","4991580"," I don't know if it's hedge fund."
"4991940","4993260"," I don't know if it's a bank doing it."
"4993500","4995220"," I don't know who it is, but somebody fucking huge. "
"4995960","5000760"," And the thesis here is that someone's doing this."
"5001780","5004540"," So we start to roll down yesterday."
"5005780","5007860"," And we hit PT one. "
"5008740","5012580"," And then we immediately red bar giant fucking red bars."
"5013480","5016320"," Straight down and slammed into PT two."
"5016600","5020460"," I think it was like a handle, maybe above PT two. "
"5021320","5022580"," And it was shocking."
"5023440","5024980"," It was absolutely shocking."
"5025960","5031560"," And what's even crazier is as we come down into this, let me see, I make this bigger here again. "
"5032420","5036050"," I think it's a little bit bigger."
"5036270","5036930"," So you can see this."
"5039570","5042750"," So not only was this bottom bought down here, right?"
"5042970","5044230"," Last two bars right here, right?"
"5044710","5044710"," Bam. "
"5045630","5046110"," Bam."
"5046970","5052750"," Not only, not only were able to close the puts for stupid, stupid returns."
"5053590","5057470"," Like we're talking like some like thousand percent, eight hundred percent. "
"5057670","5058130"," You name it."
"5059190","5064930"," Close them and then immediately by calls for expiry today."
"5066530","5068730"," Now what happens at that moment?"
"5069250","5072470"," We're buying right here way down here. "
"5072550","5074190"," This is the Wednesday close, right?"
"5075190","5077230"," And we just start cranking."
"5077230","5081030"," And you like, do I just take the profit and run?"
"5081290","5082150"," It's like fuck no."
"5083430","5085350"," So we hold into this morning. "
"5086970","5090250"," So just look, just look at that with me right here."
"5090370","5090550"," Okay."
"5091070","5092010"," So just up here. "
"5092690","5095070"," We're long from right there."
"5096290","5098330"," We're short from right there."
"5099210","5101090"," A near perfect trade. "
"5102190","5104530"," Take it straight down, right?"
"5104970","5105450"," Monetize."
"5106670","5109610"," Literally straight back up, right?"
"5109850","5110410"," And this is what?"
"5110770","5112030"," 930 right in here, right?"
"5112790","5115190"," I mean you're talking about being long from right here."
"5115690","5117330"," And this is where the open is. "
"5118450","5120090"," So you've got, who's where it gets crazy?"
"5120290","5122190"," So you've got the down move, monetize."
"5122530","5127710"," Up move, no matter, not no matter, but basically I don't give a fuck where we open this morning."
"5128410","5129630"," You take the money and run. "
"5130150","5133110"," Now why do you say take the money and run?"
"5133970","5138930"," Because here you can see the opening bell today, right?"
"5139330","5140830"," Or in past history, right there."
"5141590","5143250"," Let me delete that so you can see it better."
"5143490","5144570"," Let me ask you to bring it down. "
"5145390","5150630"," Right here, you can see that there's a cell candle right on the open."
"5151490","5154090"," And it blasts the fuck on down, doesn't it?"
"5154250","5154390"," Boom."
"5154390","5156570"," Big old bar down, boom. "
"5157150","5157770"," See it right there."
"5158930","5163210"," But even so, there's more buying into the end of the day."
"5163810","5166730"," This is called the X div Thursday ramp. "
"5168770","5171870"," Okay, now what you need is more high volume."
"5172610","5174570"," You need all these calls, right?"
"5176190","5178950"," To move up as the day moves forward, right?"
"5179210","5188510"," So you've got like the dealers are going to get exercised until end of the day on Thursday."
"5190010","5193190"," They collect the money from the dividend, right?"
"5193410","5194570"," So I've got a hundred calls. "
"5194590","5200650"," I take the call thus the underlying away from you at the end of the day today."
"5201150","5203030"," And then what do I do with those shares?"
"5203650","5207550"," All I wanted to do is hold those shares to capture the dividend."
"5207990","5210490"," And then I dump them into the market on Friday. "
"5211690","5214710"," So whoever's doing that is crazy, right?"
"5215310","5216870"," And they've been doing this."
"5218250","5223250"," So I put out a market brief last night."
"5224410","5226950"," And I'm going to show you guys this market brief right now. "
"5231340","5237440"," So in this market brief, I said, as you can see from the chart below, price is ping ponging while"
"5237440","5243360"," speculators are choosing a side on which way we break as gamma wears off into op-ex."
"5243980","5245780"," So you'll see people on Fintuit."
"5246460","5249560"," And I mean, everybody out there is going to take, right?"
"5250600","5253680"," Everybody's going to take on what's going to happen into the weekend. "
"5254220","5255760"," We're going to blast up on Monday."
"5256240","5259940"," We're going to roll down and blood bath down to the depths of hell in the Friday and it's going"
"5259940","5261860"," to continue down right off the chart, right?"
"5262580","5264620"," You can see everybody weighing in on this."
"5265160","5267640"," And you can also see that we have an issue in here, right?"
"5268320","5270120"," We have a gamma pin in here, right?"
"5270120","5273080"," We're just ping ponging around, ping ponging around. "
"5273700","5276000"," And everybody wants to be on that trade up."
"5276420","5278920"," And everybody wants to be on that trade down, right?"
"5279340","5280640"," It'd be like, look dude, I called it."
"5280740","5281600"," We're going to the depths of hell. "
"5282000","5287860"," And what's crazy here too is if you look at yesterday's price action, if you look at yesterday's"
"5287860","5292000"," price action, we knew we were going down here."
"5292720","5297840"," And people became the fucking hole into the clothes yesterday."
"5297840","5302920"," I went on fin to it yesterday and I watched people say, what?"
"5304320","5308100"," I watched people say, this was yesterday by the way, this was not this morning. "
"5308640","5310460"," I'll show you what happened this morning in a minute."
"5311040","5314900"," But you've got the gamma ping pong and you've got people buying calls, right?"
"5315860","5320140"," And the only way to break above this bar is what?"
"5321440","5323180"," Expanded calls to the upside."
"5324420","5328940"," Even if it's only short dated, a day or two, right?"
"5329100","5333360"," So you could theoretically remove this and blast up here. "
"5333840","5334700"," Does that make sense?"
"5335820","5341180"," So there's at least the mechanics are there for it to be a possibility, right?"
"5341920","5343160"," So we're stuck in here, right?"
"5343540","5344320"," We're down here."
"5344400","5348720"," Do you remember yesterday in fin to it, everyone's saying, nope, we broke down for our look back."
"5348880","5350180"," We're going to be waking up tomorrow morning. "
"5350180","5353580"," And this is where we're going to be on Thursday."
"5354460","5355920"," That didn't happen, did it?"
"5356360","5358580"," Now we did come back down today, right?"
"5358680","5361940"," We blasted down again and recovered again, or it's recovering."
"5362840","5365280"," So we'll look at that chart in a minute on SPX gamma. "
"5366060","5373860"," Now, so we'd be looking for at minimum today to capture that div, if even if we can't break out"
"5373860","5376860"," for some kind of a closure on a Friday up here."
"5376860","5379080"," So people get paid with their divs, right?"
"5379700","5383060"," And then they're free to sell this fucking thing down into Friday."
"5383660","5385280"," Sell it down on Friday, right?"
"5386120","5387880"," But we're still stuck in here. "
"5388020","5390980"," This is like, it's like a Chinese finger trap, right?"
"5391780","5394960"," So then I wrote earlier in the day of the stream, we highlighted Scott's observation that prior"
"5394960","5396120"," blah, blah, blah, right?"
"5396300","5399620"," So far the past few worked out perfectly blah, blah, saying that I outwants."
"5399860","5401300"," And this is the key part right here."
"5402440","5403120"," Right here. "
"5403500","5408540"," Saying that I outline in white what my expectations would be for tomorrow under normal conditions."
"5409820","5412080"," I also outlined an orange, a possible outcome."
"5412520","5417140"," If whoever is doing this shows up again tomorrow, if they do it again, we need to find an"
"5417140","5419640"," appropriate name for the dividend, Robinhood gang. "
"5421600","5424100"," Warning, if it does happen, close longs at the end of the day."
"5424260","5427440"," Thursday and Friday sell the openness Friday is better bloodbath."
"5427980","5430980"," Not gonna lie, if it happens, it would make one of the best stories of the year. "
"5431300","5433120"," No one will believe it if I told it to them."
"5433460","5435720"," The people that were in the stream agree with this."
"5435720","5438760"," And they probably still agree with this at this point, right?"
"5438960","5441600"," Because we knew that we were going to slam down here and we did. "
"5442020","5443880"," And we got long here, right?"
"5444440","5446180"," And what happened this morning?"
"5446580","5447040"," Do you know?"
"5447380","5448700"," I'll show you if you want to see it."
"5449240","5450340"," Give me one quick second."
"5450520","5451120"," I'm going to show you something. "
"5451520","5452400"," What happened here?"
"5452520","5454980"," So look, I'm going to look at, I posted it on Twitter."
"5455340","5456300"," I'll just tell you what happened."
"5456700","5458280"," I posted it on Twitter this morning. "
"5458840","5460200"," I'm going to show you exactly what happened here."
"5460800","5463280"," We fucking ripped right up here."
"5465940","5467320"," Exactly right there. "
"5467820","5469020"," And we pulled back."
"5469720","5471040"," Now, where do we pull back?"
"5471720","5473340"," We didn't pull back and go higher, did we?"
"5473660","5474720"," There wasn't enough gamma."
"5475640","5477500"," We didn't break through this wall, did we?"
"5477800","5480180"," So we began to pull back aggressively, didn't we?"
"5481360","5482540"," Back down here again. "
"5483560","5486580"," And that makes us trapped inside again."
"5487100","5488620"," This fucking box right here."
"5489400","5489860"," Makes sense?"
"5490700","5491860"," So we're back down in here again. "
"5491860","5499160"," Now, I also, above here, wrote to people that I left what I would normally expect to happen on a"
"5499160","5503640"," day like today, which is that we would come down here and you would find a place to buy the"
"5503640","5503840"," dip."
"5504380","5505740"," And where are we right now?"
"5506140","5507160"," We're right fucking there."
"5507760","5508260"," We're in there. "
"5508400","5509060"," Where's that right there?"
"5509200","5510860"," That's five, thirteen and change."
"5511740","5513100"," Where is price right now?"
"5514000","5514660"," Right down here."
"5515120","5515540"," You see that?"
"5516220","5520140"," So I gave you what I would expect to happen, right?"
"5520140","5524660"," But we knew it was going to take place back here, so we got the squeeze, but then we came"
"5524660","5526780"," back down into this zone again. "
"5527380","5530580"," This would be on a normal day that we wouldn't have even gotten this shit."
"5531040","5535100"," We would have just woken up like the overnight wouldn't happen, the squeeze up, this morning"
"5535100","5535620"," wouldn't happen."
"5535960","5537480"," We would have rolled this morning. "
"5538000","5542900"," And as a matter of fact, without the squeeze into the clothes yesterday and what price we woke up"
"5542900","5546940"," to this morning, you wouldn't have seen that on a normal trading day."
"5547240","5552840"," You would have woken up this morning, right, flat and started selling the open straight down right"
"5552840","5553180"," here."
"5553400","5555700"," And that's where we are right now, right there. "
"5556580","5561320"," So there's a blend this morning of both of those pieces is."
"5561920","5563740"," We're down here right now, right?"
"5564360","5568960"," Now what's the expectation from here in a normal circumstances is that you would buy the dip"
"5568960","5570300"," currently where we are."
"5571160","5573260"," You want a quick second and go back here to the main screen. "
"5575520","5578420"," So where we are right now is what?"
"5578420","5583900"," Right where the expectation is that we would come down to under normal trading."
"5584300","5587820"," And normally we would expect a move up into Friday here."
"5588320","5589600"," But we are in OpEx. "
"5590540","5592080"," And there are some concerns here."
"5593500","5600940"," There are some major concerns because after DivEx, that's today, the market really starts to free"
"5600940","5602200"," up as to where it goes."
"5602900","5609800"," You'll have people that take their dividends and they start to exit long on S&P 500. "
"5611960","5617720"," The green bar is nowhere today or tomorrow is now when today or tomorrow."
"5618560","5622300"," So my point to you or my posit to you is here, right?"
"5623620","5625520"," That they didn't show up today."
"5626360","5630740"," They didn't get to break above the gamma, right, that we're locked into. "
"5631400","5631920"," They didn't."
"5632540","5634180"," So I don't know where we go today."
"5634180","5635800"," I do know one thing. "
"5636140","5637900"," I know that we are trapped in here."
"5638040","5639700"," So I want to show you this one last thing here."
"5639700","5645060"," Not trapped per se, but I want to show you that same zone right now. "
"5646080","5648280"," So we go to the bottom right hand screen right here."
"5649780","5651000"," Here's your SPX gamma."
"5651280","5652360"," And where are we at right here?"
"5652500","5653120"," Just look at it. "
"5654360","5655220"," It's that same."
"5655400","5658380"," It's the same thing that I posted on the market brief last night, right?"
"5658920","5661820"," And that is that we are locked in right here."
"5663860","5664340"," Right?"
"5664520","5664820"," We're in this. "
"5664940","5667700"," We're in this fucking like, what did I call it?"
"5667760","5669120"," A ping pong trap or something."
"5669560","5673540"," And the thumbnail this morning was also balls of fury, right?"
"5674360","5675600"," Ping pong ping pong."
"5675900","5677140"," And look what they did, right?"
"5677520","5678080"," Couldn't break above. "
"5678380","5679180"," We got above here."
"5679280","5680620"," It could blast right back down."
"5681120","5681660"," And do we break?"
"5681960","5683380"," Do we start to send it down?"
"5683840","5683900"," No. "
"5684700","5689860"," But as we get into the end of the day, we know that once the X div is done today,"
"5689860","5691780"," the market's free to go where it wants."
"5692020","5692980"," And you see this here?"
"5693480","5695900"," It's being pounded down for the end of the day."
"5696660","5698240"," And I will say one thing. "
"5698300","5706340"," If we don't grind up into the close, the next leg of this trade is Friday is expected to be"
"5706340","5706800"," down."
"5707140","5707880"," Down move."
"5708560","5710080"," So we're going to monitor it closely. "
"5710800","5714640"," Now, I think these calls are still in the market right now."
"5714660","5720640"," I don't think any of these calls have been sold or monetized or the dividend taken out."
"5720720","5721160"," Maybe it was. "
"5723060","5725260"," Maybe they're just closed up here."
"5725420","5729320"," Whoever that market participant is, they said, fuck yeah, we're closing that."
"5729640","5730000"," Make sense?"
"5730600","5738620"," Now, if you were in this trade with us yesterday, and you looked at, if you look at the, let"
"5738620","5739400"," me go back to this one. "
"5740160","5746140"," So if you were in this trade with us yesterday, and if you were our member or supporter or hire,"
"5746140","5750080"," you could have seen immediately from this."
"5750320","5755460"," And if you're in the stream, you knew that whatever the squeeze up on the open was, was one part"
"5755460","5756040"," of the trade."
"5756340","5757640"," So your first part of the trade is here. "
"5758440","5758700"," First leg."
"5759160","5760240"," Sell it down, right?"
"5761400","5761780"," Next leg."
"5762520","5763140"," Take it up. "
"5763980","5764160"," Right?"
"5764340","5765080"," So that's one leg."
"5765960","5766900"," That's two legs."
"5767600","5770660"," And then your third leg is buying this dip right here. "
"5771360","5773280"," And lo and behold, we're on the hourly trigger."
"5773280","5775840"," Now we broke through the hourly trigger, right?"
"5776000","5776760"," Where does that send us?"
"5777160","5777580"," Straight down."
"5778080","5778700"," Make sense?"
"5779260","5785820"," So this, this third part of what you're expecting this, and it did happen, but it did not stop"
"5785820","5787260"," where we wanted it to stop. "
"5787880","5794700"," The fourth trade in this, the fourth leg is a scream up into the close, or even up here, right?"
"5794820","5795520"," That's the fourth leg."
"5799210","5805790"," And then the fifth leg is a sell the news event on Friday."
"5806470","5807870"," So we got the number one check. "
"5808390","5809670"," We got the number two check."
"5810150","5812570"," Number three check and a half check."
"5813350","5815390"," Because we didn't expect it to go this deep, did it?"
"5816010","5817930"," So we'd say that's like a half weeks. "
"5817950","5821050"," We anticipated this, but not the depth of it."
"5821590","5825490"," Now, number four, we don't know what's going to happen, do we?"
"5825930","5830050"," And we don't know what's going to happen on the fifth part of this leg."
"5830630","5834910"," And from my perspective here this morning, I don't know where we're going. "
"5835310","5839750"," I don't know if we're going to squeeze up into the close, because we have now some dead calls,"
"5839750","5843070"," right now that they're dead, they'll go back up into the end of the day."
"5843630","5847830"," Hold on a second, we go back to the main screen, over there, and get rid of this."
"5848190","5852630"," So I'd give this trade so far, like half worked. "
"5853390","5859630"," And inside of that market brief last night, and in the stream yesterday, what did I tell you?"
"5859630","5867110"," I said, even if it's worked for you twice now, right, it's worked twice, that you do not double"
"5867110","5867370"," down."
"5867650","5872330"," You don't triple down, you don't put your whole accounting to say, I made $50,000, I'm going to"
"5872330","5873670"," double down on 50 grand here."
"5873870","5877370"," So you guys should still be big-time winners. "
"5878030","5884770"," Now, when you were looking this morning for a dip to buy, we broke down below the hourly trigger,"
"5885130","5885310"," right?"
"5887510","5893290"," We come down to the hourly trigger this morning, and we reject the half-hour trigger and blast"
"5893290","5894370"," straight down, right?"
"5894590","5895050"," Depth of hell."
"5895970","5898810"," And what are we looking for in that blast down?"
"5899310","5901750"," We're looking for where we bought."
"5902610","5909790"," This is the original demand right here, and this is the next known demand right here, right?"
"5910510","5911570"," So PT1 and PT2. "
"5912710","5915550"," We got PT1, PT2 down here, and it bounced."
"5916570","5919130"," We did find that demand is still there."
"5919470","5921910"," I'll bet that demand is weaker. "
"5923670","5930810"," If you are a bull, you are normally looking for demand to come up right here, you're looking for"
"5930810","5937130"," that demand above, it wasn't there, and instead of it being here still, it's actually lower, the"
"5937130","5937730"," next place."
"5938510","5942350"," So we have declining demand from bulls right now, don't we?"
"5943250","5950190"," We have this initial buy right now, and my next question to you would be, did we go straight up?"
"5951330","5951850"," No."
"5952690","5955850"," Did we get the buyers step in right here, right?"
"5956610","5958750"," Have any buyers stepped in since then?"
"5959430","5961170"," Do you see continued buyers?"
"5962210","5962310"," No. "
"5963050","5963910"," We don't do it."
"5964690","5965810"," We don't see that right now."
"5966150","5971430"," So if I don't see continued buying, there's two things you can take away from this. "
"5971430","5977510"," There's some insight here, and that is buyers want prices lower."
"5978090","5978810"," Does that make sense?"
"5979710","5982570"," So right now, they're probably accumulating."
"5983210","5986150"," See that they're down here accumulating, right?"
"5986290","5987190"," My cursor is right here. "
"5987310","5988130"," They're down here accumulating."
"5988430","5994050"," You can see them accumulating, but they might want that price a little bit lower before they come"
"5994050","5995310"," in force, right?"
"5995690","6000530"," So we're waiting right now on demand and look at book map right now."
"6000530","6002670"," And what are we sitting on right now?"
"6004110","6005410"," We're not sitting on a..."
"6005410","6005890"," Hold on there. "
"6007510","6009490"," We're not sitting on..."
"6012280","6013800"," Let me go over there and show you."
"6018570","6019970"," We're sitting on right here."
"6020430","6021770"," Does that look like the man to you?"
"6022450","6024790"," It sure as shit doesn't look like the man to me. "
"6025570","6026790"," I don't see major..."
"6026790","6029710"," Maybe there is, maybe it's just hidden buyers hanging out in there, but I don't see it."
"6030850","6035090"," So I'd be quite wary of any buyers in here right now."
"6035090","6037090"," That looks kind of scary to me. "
"6037270","6038570"," Does that look scary to you?"
"6040210","6044910"," Oh, it's like an error."
"6045230","6048910"," I'm trying to read what you guys are saying, but let me ask you that question."
"6049110","6049990"," Do you see the demand there?"
"6050150","6050650"," I don't. "
"6051130","6052930"," So I'm pretty sketched out here, right?"
"6053470","6054890"," Where do I see demand right now?"
"6055610","6056450"," Let's take a look and see."
"6057150","6059570"," I see some right here, a little bit right here."
"6060210","6061510"," So I got to remove my other cursor. "
"6061510","6064250"," I see a little bit right here."
"6064530","6065490"," Can I see a little bit low?"
"6065570","6066730"," Let me see if I can find anything else in here."
"6067610","6069170"," There's any kind of squishy like..."
"6069170","6070210"," Oh, there's a little bit right there. "
"6070370","6071550"," There is some right there."
"6071690","6072830"," Not ton, but there's some."
"6073970","6075410"," But boy, look at that stink bit. "
"6075550","6076270"," Much lower, right?"
"6082670","6084170"," I'm telling him, getting old as fuck."
"6085850","6088630"," Done at 51.85 is where that demand is."
"6089670","6090230"," Hold on a second there. "
"6091770","6093450"," I got a lot of things going on here."
"6093810","6094790"," So right in here, right?"
"6095330","6096590"," Where's our next demand?"
"6097130","6097950"," It's way down here."
"6098350","6099050"," See it down here?"
"6101310","6103010"," We bring that over for you. "
"6103910","6106910"," I'm going to bet that this is that next bar down below."
"6108790","6110770"," That this next bar right here."
"6111650","6113910"," See that flag flying around?"
"6114610","6115510"," Got my flag out. "
"6115790","6116670"," Got my trader flag out."
"6116830","6117090"," You see it?"
"6117230","6117690"," Got my book back."
"6117870","6118610"," I flag out. "
"6119010","6123710"," So just down in here, I don't think that's out of the realm of possibility."
"6124510","6129510"," Just see a bloodbath down here for it to find out if there's actually demand down here right now."
"6130210","6132070"," Okay, so this looks kind of bearish to me. "
"6132170","6134530"," Not bearish, but just get priced down."
"6134690","6135330"," I'm down here."
"6135690","6136910"," You got to come see me down here. "
"6137570","6140710"," So we'll pay attention to this and see if we can get priced to the downside."
"6141710","6143910"," Okay, can we get that price to the downside?"
"6144490","6149630"," Now, what I'm going to say to you is, if you wanted to buy the dip here, if you're a"
"6149630","6155370"," bull, and you're like, oh cap, I want to buy this so fucking bad, I would say to you, you"
"6155370","6155930"," can't."
"6156310","6160770"," Now, there's some other things here that are good for you as a bull, right?"
"6161610","6163130"," This looks all doom and gloomish. "
"6163510","6165110"," There are some good signs here."
"6165970","6168750"," The violence of the one minute trigger has gone sideways."
"6169530","6170770"," That's a positive for you. "
"6171230","6171490"," Okay?"
"6172210","6173110"," It's flattening."
"6173410","6175410"," There's no velocity to the downside right now."
"6176550","6179330"," The five minute trigger is flattening. "
"6180190","6182250"," But up here is pretty bearish."
"6182570","6184650"," You see that half hour trigger crossing right there?"
"6185310","6186410"," You know what happens when that happens?"
"6186950","6192170"," When the half hour trigger crosses the hourly trigger, it gets pretty gnarly."
"6192710","6195950"," One, you may expect a squeeze to it to test it. "
"6196830","6200430"," Oftentimes, if it's rejected, it is gnarly to the downside."
"6201230","6202970"," And this looks really creepy crawly, doesn't it?"
"6202970","6205190"," So I'm pretty bearish here right now."
"6205550","6208510"," Not necessarily bear, but I wouldn't be buying this dip. "
"6208890","6214250"," Now, if you wanted to buy this dip, what would you be looking for to buy this dip?"
"6214890","6216710"," So if you're like, I just want to buy a fucking dip, man."
"6217030","6218090"," I want to make some more fucking money."
"6218910","6221090"," I would say, first of all, this is not financial advice. "
"6222950","6225310"," But I would say something very important to you."
"6226030","6228230"," Let's go over there and look at it and I'll show you right now."
"6229110","6231690"," So let's go to the trigger full screen, okay?"
"6233450","6235190"," What would I do to buy a dip here?"
"6235350","6236890"," Let's make this bigger so you can see it. "
"6237710","6239870"," Okay, yeah, we're on known support right here."
"6240330","6242190"," We got some weakness in book map."
"6242410","6244230"," Doesn't let me, this looks pretty doomish, right?"
"6245070","6248290"," But what would you be looking for to take a trade here as a bull?"
"6249110","6250270"," I'm going to draw it out for you. "
"6250370","6251790"," Now, I don't care if we go down."
"6252530","6257950"," I'm going to preface this with, I don't care from where we are right now if we go down."
"6257950","6260010"," I don't give a fuck if this happens at all. "
"6260190","6260610"," I don't care."
"6261010","6262070"," It hasn't happened yet, right?"
"6262690","6264430"," We're trying to predict what'll happen, right?"
"6265170","6265690"," Let me ask you that."
"6265790","6267290"," Let me make that statement to you. "
"6267690","6271970"," You are trying to predict what will happen."
"6273050","6273530"," Predict."
"6274890","6279650"," And there's a law of probabilities when you start to make predictions. "
"6280550","6282290"," If you're like, hey, I'm going to make a trading plan."
"6283090","6283990"," And I got a thesis."
"6283990","6287230"," I got my trader journal, all that kind of stuff. "
"6288270","6295030"," But you want to predict what is going to happen with a high rate of probability of making you"
"6295030","6295290"," money."
"6295930","6298370"," And right now, what is the high probability trade here?"
"6298890","6301270"," It's down, right?"
"6301510","6306270"," We have a, right now currently we have a bear cross above."
"6306830","6308290"," This is your warning right here. "
"6309090","6310570"," This was actually your warning, right?"
"6311250","6312330"," Your warning was a bear plane."
"6313390","6317110"," Your second one was the rejection of a half hour trigger on price."
"6317770","6318910"," Blasted you straight down. "
"6319370","6320650"," There has been no recovery."
"6321330","6325010"," And you have a cross of a half hour going down over the hourly trigger."
"6325210","6326190"," That's all bear shit. "
"6327150","6332070"," So in my view right now, I'm like, I'm fucking all bear it up here."
"6332410","6333770"," I'm super fucking bear it up here."
"6334150","6336850"," Or at least in the intraday basis, I'm pretty fucking bear it up here. "
"6337190","6341350"," Now I am aware that there is some gamma support here, right?"
"6341350","6342530"," We know that about SPX."
"6343610","6347330"," But even so, you know, you have a quick, quick flash down and then up."
"6347690","6350030"," That makes sense to me, right?"
"6350630","6352750"," We've got some support from that gamma, right?"
"6352930","6357350"," And then we also have a, once it, once it blasts down, it's, it becomes a magnet to drag us"
"6357350","6357850"," back up. "
"6359390","6361390"," Parking the bus we say around here, right?"
"6363590","6365650"," So right now, I'm not feeling it."
"6366050","6369230"," Now if you wanted to take a trade here as a bull."
"6369670","6371710"," So this is all stuff we've gleaned, right?"
"6372750","6374010"," I got my trade plan out. "
"6374150","6375050"," I got my thesis out."
"6375210","6376430"," I did a bunch of investigating."
"6377030","6378650"," And I'm like, what am I going to do here?"
"6379330","6380390"," Now let's say you're a bear. "
"6381010","6382150"," You're like, fuck that."
"6383010","6384030"," I'm a bear dude."
"6384470","6386590"," I make all my money selling. "
"6387750","6390270"," So what's your plan here, right?"
"6390510","6391570"," Your plan here is a seller."
"6391990","6393570"," Is there a seller below this, right?"
"6393790","6394510"," Your stops are above."
"6395570","6398870"," Even if you get squeezed out to the upside, you know it's going to come back. "
"6398870","6400850"," And you're going to exit in an early fashion."
"6401390","6405950"," Even if you have to re, even if it rolls down, you're going to reset your trade to the downside."
"6407030","6408070"," There's some steps, right?"
"6408810","6411750"," So if I'm going to go through this really quickly as a, as a bull. "
"6412710","6417670"," What you need to see as a bull, and we'll get back to the bear trade in a minute."
"6418910","6423950"," You need to see the turning up of the five minute trigger."
"6425410","6428330"," You need to see the turning up of the limit. "
"6429610","6435150"," You need to see the turning up of the one minute trigger, right?"
"6436350","6442190"," And you need to see price reverse before you even consider buying a dip."
"6442790","6445570"," This is the best lesson that I can teach you out there, okay?"
"6446130","6448230"," This is like the best lesson I can teach you out there."
"6448670","6450770"," There's no better lesson than I could ever teach you. "
"6451670","6460070"," So if we break higher here, you are looking for this last pie, right?"
"6460310","6460990"," Just this last one."
"6461170","6461390"," That's it."
"6461630","6468970"," You want to see if we break above this, you're likely going to see a reversal, like about 70%"
"6468970","6469430"," of the time. "
"6471250","6472090"," Right there."
"6472390","6473750"," And you're just, you're not even long yet."
"6474090","6475050"," You're not even fucking long. "
"6475630","6477170"," You're just watching price action."
"6477730","6480010"," This next target should be right about here."
"6480530","6481450"," It's the next one right there. "
"6481630","6485650"," And we should reverse again, right?"
"6485810","6487250"," To the downside right there, right?"
"6487550","6488170"," Start putting around."
"6491000","6494340"," And then the next one should come straight up here, right?"
"6494720","6498320"," And get on this hourly trigger, right?"
"6499380","6503360"," You got that half hour trigger going down there, and now what does this mean?"
"6505320","6507340"," This is where the real sellers are."
"6507340","6509980"," This is where the strong sellers are. "
"6510100","6512540"," This is where like the people that want it to go to zero."
"6513140","6514620"," This is where they're trading."
"6515180","6519120"," So if you're a bear, this is where they are right here. "
"6521520","6527320"," And you're going to find out, excuse me, find out right here who is stronger."
"6528640","6531040"," The sellers or the buyers."
"6532040","6536360"," When you're on social media, you're going to hear people tell you, well, the buyers are really"
"6536360","6537020"," strong there. "
"6537020","6539380"," The sellers are really strong there."
"6540140","6542660"," But you don't really care what they say."
"6543380","6548640"," You're just looking, observing, to literally see who is stronger. "
"6551840","6553140"," You don't care what people are saying."
"6553480","6554600"," You can see it for yourself."
"6554840","6556000"," It's very easy to see. "
"6563330","6567870"," If buyers are weak here, it will immediately reverse the downside."
"6570110","6571370"," It'll blast through."
"6572350","6573530"," Catch a new low. "
"6574510","6577610"," And of course, some fucking bears going to buy that when they shouldn't."
"6577970","6580650"," And it's going to come back up and then blast to the depths of hell."
"6582090","6584590"," Your Johnny on the spot right there is a seller. "
"6584930","6585470"," Does that make sense?"
"6586070","6586690"," Johnny on the spot."
"6586950","6587510"," Set the trade up."
"6588210","6589070"," Wait for it to happen. "
"6589470","6589850"," Bam, selling."
"6593980","6603940"," Now, these sellers stepped"
"6603940","6605540"," in and tried to sell it down, right?"
"6606180","6613820"," If these buyers are down here hiding and they're actually really right there, they're going to rip"
"6613820","6615120"," their fucking faces off."
"6616400","6617220"," Straight up. "
"6618300","6620220"," They're going to rip their fucking faces off."
"6621000","6623540"," So you're also Johnny on the spot with a counter trade."
"6624660","6626620"," And forget the point of that either. "
"6627320","6628860"," You don't even need to take this trade."
"6639590","6641390"," You know it's there."
"6643710","6644970"," You know it's there. "
"6645110","6646450"," You know the squeezes there, right?"
"6646890","6649910"," But what confirms that we're heading higher?"
"6650550","6651790"," Listen to me closely here."
"6652470","6654450"," What's confirms that we're heading higher?"
"6656330","6657570"," It's the fucking back test."
"6659890","6662650"," The fucking back test comes back down. "
"6663570","6669130"," If you see those fucking buyers step back in that next time right there, you are like boom."
"6670550","6672510"," I am with the buyers."
"6673530","6674270"," Does that make sense?"
"6675170","6676650"," That's when you get the reversal. "
"6682060","6684080"," That's when you begin to see price."
"6686220","6691530"," Hold on."
"6693110","6694730"," That's when you begin to see price. "
"6695830","6697910"," Begin to want to make huge moves to the upside."
"6697910","6702190"," If you're a bull, you want to always be long here."
"6702770","6704810"," Not fucking down here under this bullshit. "
"6705810","6706770"," You want any of that."
"6706930","6708290"," That's a trap for you to get blooded."
"6709170","6709870"," Does that make sense?"
"6710470","6712730"," You want to be a buyer somewhere in here. "
"6713910","6717070"," And you would love to have that hourly trigger underneath you, right?"
"6717730","6720690"," Now you've got momentum behind you."
"6721170","6722830"," You are above the hourly trigger."
"6723310","6725310"," You are above the one minute and the five minutes. "
"6725690","6726870"," And price is above it."
"6726870","6732470"," When you see that right there, you see that hourly trigger, five minute trigger, one minute"
"6732470","6736630"," trigger, and you see price, you are a fucking buyer."
"6737410","6738690"," We say that all the time. "
"6740250","6741690"," Hourly trigger on the bottom."
"6742530","6744610"," Five minute trigger, one minute trigger."
"6745050","6745930"," On top is price. "
"6746770","6750170"," This simplifies trading for you out there."
"6750410","6752070"," You don't have to think a lot, do you?"
"6752690","6754990"," If price is above the one, the five, and the hourly?"
"6756210","6757030"," We're on trend."
"6757510","6758310"," We're heading higher. "
"6759370","6764190"," If you don't have that, let's say your bull friend is out there right now."
"6764250","6765210"," You've got friends that are bulls."
"6766250","6768070"," And they're telling you, and I do this shit. "
"6768210","6768890"," I'm guilty of it."
"6769630","6771070"," You got to see me do it here, right?"
"6771350","6773330"," Whenever I lose trades, when do I lose them?"
"6773970","6775210"," When do I lose a trade?"
"6776790","6777950"," Always right here."
"6779190","6779630"," Why?"
"6780250","6782170"," Because it's the low probability trade. "
"6782170","6789490"," You never, ever see me lose trades when we're above the hourly trigger, when it's price, one, five,"
"6789770","6791090"," and an hourly trigger."
"6791450","6791590"," Ever."
"6791870","6792410"," It's just go. "
"6792690","6793190"," We're off and running."
"6793850","6797190"," And even if it does roll down, I know where the stops are."
"6797470","6798990"," I know where to cut my losses or my wins. "
"6799850","6801250"," I might have had about 300%."
"6801250","6803630"," Now I'm down to 100% winner."
"6804310","6805830"," But I know where to cut them too, don't I?"
"6806570","6808830"," So is there a trade here right now for a bull?"
"6809450","6809870"," No. "
"6809870","6812570"," Now, are you going to meet people?"
"6813570","6816810"," Are you going to meet people on, let's say, social media?"
"6817770","6819210"," Let's say you're in a chat room."
"6819930","6820990"," Let's say you're on Twitter."
"6821830","6824130"," Let's say you're in Wall Street, bets are stuck to it. "
"6824210","6830910"," So wherever that is, there will always be a voice in the room telling you they bought the dip."
"6831670","6834390"," If it fails for them, they disappear."
"6835730","6836270"," Not all of them. "
"6836490","6838090"," Some people are like, yeah, I bought it and I got smoked."
"6838090","6845630"," But most of the voice, the noise, it just fades away in the background, right?"
"6846650","6848850"," And the same thing goes for bears, for sellers."
"6849490","6850970"," They'll always be the noise. "
"6851250","6851710"," We're going to crash."
"6851910","6852350"," We're going to crash."
"6852530","6852930"," We're going to crash. "
"6854270","6855250"," And then they fade."
"6856130","6862590"," As a matter of fact, on Fintuit this morning, on that open, Fintuit was a fucking ghost town."
"6862590","6864770"," And I mean ghost town. "
"6865370","6866850"," It was a ghost town this morning."
"6868490","6868970"," Why?"
"6870230","6873130"," Because everybody was fucking short in that close yesterday."
"6874250","6875250"," You understand what I'm saying?"
"6875530","6876670"," And they got fucking smoked. "
"6877370","6882110"," And they're probably going to come out today and Fintuit and say, I was short in the open and it"
"6882110","6884850"," blasted down and I'm all beared up and made a bunch of money."
"6885350","6886590"," They're all fucking liars."
"6887150","6889330"," You got to be there before it happens. "
"6890210","6891070"," Not after."
"6892030","6894510"," I don't want to hear your voice after it happens."
"6894870","6897730"," I don't want to hear your fucking voice after anything happens. "
"6898390","6903650"," I want to hear your voice before it happens and what your thesis is to why it should happen."
"6904050","6909790"," And I truly, be honest with you, whether you're a seller or a buyer, I truly want to hear your"
"6909790","6914230"," voice when you're like, if you're a bull, I want to find you somewhere."
"6914390","6922350"," So if you're like a social media and you want to start trusting traders, you want to already be"
"6922350","6931190"," seeing this take in place and find someone on your favorite friends out there and they're like, I'm"
"6931190","6931910"," long as fuck. "
"6932750","6936810"," When you see someone say that right there, I trust that guy."
"6937530","6938090"," Do you understand?"
"6938830","6940110"," That guy's probably fucking trading."
"6940590","6941830"," That girl's probably fucking trading. "
"6942510","6944130"," And that motherfucker probably has a good plan."
"6945590","6952910"," If we blast up and we're mooning, I usually don't believe those people that didn't have a history"
"6952910","6953830"," of saying, I'm long."
"6955090","6956770"," I think that they're fucking lying. "
"6957050","6960150"," I think they're fucking just trying to look good on social media."
"6965170","6967550"," And I think the same thing right here, right?"
"6967850","6969990"," You're going to have people disappear, not say anything."
"6970890","6976610"," And then if we blood this, you're going to see even our chat here with people saying, oh, I made"
"6976610","6979330"," so much money in that drop everywhere. "
"6979610","6980070"," You see it everywhere."
"6980230","6983950"," You see it in Discord, see it on Twitter, see it on Wall Street, but see it everywhere."
"6984730","6985210"," Right?"
"6985630","6992530"," So if right now someone was out there on social media, they should be saying to you, I'm either"
"6992530","6992910"," flat. "
"6994690","7001490"," This is not everybody, but I'm either flat or I'm short here or I'm long puts here because that is"
"7001490","7002850"," the positioning right now."
"7004610","7007910"," And if it reverses, they should come back and say I closed."
"7008750","7009550"," It went against me there. "
"7010830","7011530"," Licked my wound."
"7012070","7013950"," I didn't lose a ton, but we're going up now."
"7014630","7019110"," So pay attention to that when you're out there in the real world listening to people out there"
"7019110","7019850"," talking to you. "
"7020170","7026230"," You want to see people that are there before that they see the setups and that their risk is low."
"7027070","7030390"," And then if it goes against them, they can manage that trade because you're not going to be a"
"7030390","7031550"," winner every time."
"7032770","7038350"," The rule in this profession is not you're always right. "
"7038790","7042350"," And if you meet people out there that say that, they're a fucking liar."
"7044290","7048950"," You, as a market participant, are going to be wrong a lot."
"7049610","7052970"," If you are right three out of ten times, you're doing pretty good. "
"7053550","7058230"," If you're right five out of ten times, seven out of ten times, you're doing great."
"7059330","7062150"," So if you use these tools, you are going to get a higher win rate."
"7063090","7064010"," Does that make sense?"
"7065130","7067890"," But if that guy's out there telling you after, hey, I won this one. "
"7067990","7068530"," I won that one."
"7068650","7069170"," I won this one."
"7069510","7071350"," You know, they're not giving you the pre. "
"7071750","7072290"," I'm in this."
"7072410","7072910"," I'm in that."
"7073370","7074010"," Went against me. "
"7074050","7075070"," I'm getting torched right now."
"7075390","7076250"," Any of that kind of stuff."
"7076530","7077170"," Beware of that. "
"7078930","7083230"," So right now, S&P 500, for me, is not a buy."
"7084090","7086670"," I need to see progress."
"7087410","7088410"," Even if we squeeze. "
"7088950","7090990"," And that's the last part of this last part here."
"7091770","7096330"," Those voices that are out there talking to you, when they disappear, right?"
"7096790","7101630"," It can seem to you like everybody is always right and you're always wrong."
"7102350","7104730"," You have to counter think in your head. "
"7105610","7107770"," Because those people always come and go."
"7107990","7108490"," Come and go."
"7108790","7109190"," Come and go. "
"7109710","7111150"," Those aren't the real voices."
"7113770","7115490"," Does that make sense to you guys out there?"
"7115490","7115910"," Let me ask you."
"7115970","7118270"," Let me check your chat right now. "
"7118690","7119970"," You guys understand what I'm saying here?"
"7128120","7130680"," The spy clothes that are 513 were going."
"7130880","7131180"," Yeah, chase."
"7131400","7132420"," Just stop chatting for a minute. "
"7132420","7132620"," Chase."
"7132760","7134320"," I got to get regular people talking here."
"7135280","7136700"," Can't listen to it right now. "
"7139320","7140100"," You can be right."
"7140280","7141580"," Yes, you absolutely can."
"7145040","7145440"," Okay. "
"7145520","7147500"," So you guys are at least understanding this concept, right?"
"7148300","7150420"," So be aware of people anywhere."
"7150820","7152760"," They're telling you things like this and that."
"7153180","7156540"," And be aware of even aggressive conversation like whoo. "
"7156720","7158200"," You should have been in the trade first."
"7158380","7160140"," And I noticed it yesterday and finned to it."
"7161040","7163780"," And someone asked me and I said on finned to it yesterday. "
"7163780","7169120"," And this morning I reinforced that I said, I don't want to tell you the trade because the trade"
"7169120","7170160"," started yesterday."
"7171540","7175720"," And if I tell you the trade, you're likely going to jump in on it when it's too late."
"7176840","7182340"," So I made some comments this morning in the early morning hours and then yesterday I made a post"
"7182340","7182860"," about it. "
"7183880","7187520"," So when you're listening to people out there, you don't know where the trade is, where it started,"
"7187740","7188300"," where it's ending."
"7188620","7189580"," You just want to get in on the trade."
"7190040","7191140"," You might be in the end of the trade. "
"7191320","7194800"," You might be in the middle of the trade and not where it starts and not where it ends or"
"7194800","7197260"," even if it goes against you at some point."
"7197800","7199020"," Are you up like they are?"
"7199800","7202360"," Are you up 2,000% jumping in that trade?"
"7203200","7203700"," Likely not."
"7204920","7205840"," Does that make sense?"
"7206720","7212720"," So if I'm up 2,000% trade goes south and I exit at 1,800% or 2,000 "
"7212720","7217120","% exit at 15% profit and you're just getting into that trade. "
"7217340","7218200"," You're likely getting smoked."
"7219160","7219920"," Does that make sense?"
"7221200","7224060"," So get in on the start of the trade as the point."
"7224900","7230900"," Have a thesis, have some evidence that the going in the direction you're going to go in and have an"
"7230900","7233220"," ability to manage that trade if it goes against you. "
"7237070","7238330"," That's a great question."
"7238670","7239610"," Trade paralysis."
"7240730","7241950"," It is a real thing. "
"7242470","7243590"," It is a real thing."
"7244570","7247430"," What I would always say to somebody that have had trade paralysis."
"7248470","7254210"," Trade paralysis for me is walk away from the fucking market and take a break. "
"7255090","7260150"," Take a break from the market, stop trading and start to watch the market."
"7260890","7265290"," I find that the more time I spend away from the market, if I take a week off a month"
"7265290","7271770"," off anything, I start to watch the market again and normally what it is for me, for me personally"
"7271770","7272610"," for trade paralysis."
"7273730","7277110"," I figure out about a week later, I go, you know what?"
"7277990","7279090"," I'm fucking trading. "
"7280850","7282770"," Watch these right now, watch that shit."
"7285170","7286370"," I love this."
"7286850","7289170"," I love when it goes where I think it's going. "
"7290570","7291370"," You want to see it?"
"7293250","7296430"," So if you were a bull right now, right, you'd be getting smoked, wouldn't you?"
"7304310","7305910"," So my point here is this."
"7307710","7308930"," Yeah, there it goes right there."
"7309190","7313190"," Sorry, I need some water. "
"7313390","7314110"," I'm losing my voice here."
"7314270","7316430"," It's like, it's fucking late in the week, dude."
"7316430","7322790"," I'm streaming like eight hour fucking days every day, like nine to fucking four, nine thirty to"
"7322790","7323290"," four, whatever. "
"7323570","7325210"," I'm getting blasted here in my voice."
"7331010","7333850"," We got a new low right now in the prior low in the day."
"7334890","7336050"," This is the prior low. "
"7336450","7338690"," We talk about bulls all the time around here, right?"
"7340210","7343290"," So let's pretend this is an upside down bull move, right?"
"7343730","7344970"," So this is going to make this yellow."
"7346590","7347030"," Right?"
"7347230","7347930"," That's not support."
"7348490","7349930"," I can promise you that's not support. "
"7351870","7355050"," Pretend this is now I draw these yellow boxes on top, right?"
"7355270","7356810"," I'm going to draw them flipped in reverse."
"7358430","7359990"," So they got a new low, right?"
"7360450","7363210"," You got the low and now you get a new low, right?"
"7364110","7365750"," That's bearish as fuck, isn't it?"
"7366850","7367290"," Right?"
"7368290","7369730"," Which doesn't mean we can't squeeze up."
"7370030","7372150"," We already checked the one in five minute trigger, right?"
"7372470","7373210"," We checked the one here. "
"7373210","7374190"," We checked the five here."
"7375190","7376670"," So what's the expectation here?"
"7377010","7378910"," All we need is the new low, right?"
"7379050","7380830"," We don't need to go down to depth of how, we just need the new low."
"7381370","7382730"," So you're short here, right?"
"7384710","7390830"," And even if we come back up and retest that one minute trigger, what's the expectation?"
"7392590","7397670"," Then we're going to go down to the next known buyer zone down there. "
"7400190","7403710"," So let's see how this how this trade plays itself out."
"7405170","7408670"," We have this just the new low come back up, right?"
"7409850","7410830"," Oh, look at that right there."
"7410890","7411370"," It's so bloody. "
"7412330","7413290"," Oh, yeah."
"7415870","7417570"," What are you looking for here?"
"7417870","7418610"," What color is this?"
"7420910","7422150"," Hold on, leave this over."
"7425460","7429080"," Do you see how just through this investigation, if you're a bull. "
"7430960","7433320"," You're not getting fucking smoked, right?"
"7434520","7435360"," You see that?"
"7436120","7437860"," Now this is the expectation, right?"
"7437920","7441720"," We're going to blood it down, come back up, put it back down, back down here."
"7445100","7448160"," So through all of this investigation, we just did together."
"7449340","7453340"," If you're a bull, you didn't get to smote it out, did you?"
"7454580","7461680"," I really need to reinforce this because if we're going to get a job, down move in this market, if"
"7461680","7466560"," we're going to get a correction in this market, it's due, right?"
"7467240","7473920"," If we're going to get one and you're a bull that's been riding the fucking wave all quarter long"
"7473920","7476800"," and it's always worked. "
"7477620","7478900"," Hey, I bought the wrong fucking place."
"7479540","7481220"," Hey, I fucking doesn't matter where I buy."
"7481440","7486000"," If I can buy Nvidia, I can buy Nvidia in a fucking top and I can put through a two"
"7486000","7486840"," month pile on it. "
"7487000","7488180"," We blast down the depths of hell."
"7488480","7491200"," I know at some point it's going to be at least up 30%."
"7492920","7493440"," Right?"
"7494520","7496720"," That is not true most of the time. "
"7498860","7500060"," This pink is crazy."
"7500880","7503380"," We're doing pink, fucking, we're doing pink bears there."
"7503840","7504520"," We're in pink today. "
"7505100","7505420"," So."
"7506700","7514800"," If this market does correct or even, I don't know, March of next year, if we go into a bear"
"7514800","7523080"," market, you do not want to give all of your money back to the stock market because you stayed in"
"7523080","7523980"," that bull mode."
"7524620","7525180"," Does that make sense?"
"7526500","7530760"," I had a conversation with, um, I had a conversation with who?"
"7531540","7533360"," He's a very famous trader, I guess. "
"7535000","7535840"," What's his name?"
"7536360","7539080"," He's got like a, um, what's his name?"
"7540060","7541680"," I had a private conversation."
"7541860","7543200"," I forget his name right now."
"7543480","7545280"," He's a, he's got like a million followers. "
"7545840","7547520"," Like literally guys got like a million followers."
"7547840","7548640"," A famous trader."
"7549640","7556460"," And we had a long conversation late night one night on Fintuit and DMS. And he was like, I made"
"7556460","7557860"," so much fucking money."
"7558640","7560440"," Uh, in 2020 and 2021."
"7560740","7563800"," He's like, I just made stupid money, millions. "
"7564920","7568740"," And, uh, he was like, I gave back at least half of it."
"7571560","7574000"," Because I thought I was a great trader."
"7574740","7577160"," And people in, people in public think he's a great trader. "
"7577700","7581680"," He's like fucking, you're like, if you're like, if you're to point out like these are the top 10"
"7581680","7582020"," traders."
"7582360","7582860"," He's one of them."
"7584120","7586720"," And he was like, I, he's like, I just couldn't make a mistake. "
"7586880","7588500"," He's like, I just buy a fucking dip."
"7588520","7589260"," We'd make money."
"7590700","7595620"," And it wasn't the buying the dip where he lost a bunch of that money. "
"7596080","7597200"," Guess how we lost that money?"
"7597960","7599860"," He didn't remove it from the stock market."
"7600160","7601660"," Number one, true story."
"7602200","7605980"," Didn't remove it to invest, invest in less risk. "
"7606940","7609920"," And the second reason that he started losing money."
"7610760","7612600"," What's the second reason?"
"7613970","7618740"," His ego told him that it didn't matter if he made the trade wrong."
"7619040","7619920"," He was a great trader. "
"7620840","7622220"," So he eventually would pay."
"7623040","7624460"," So if we get into that mindset."
"7625340","7631380"," If we get into that mindset as a trader, it can come back to haunt us in a correction. "
"7632240","7636100"," It can come back to haunt us in a bear market or any of that kind of stuff."
"7636760","7643020"," So I need you guys in the next bear market or the next correction to have the awareness to not"
"7643020","7644060"," blow yourselves up."
"7644200","7650060"," If you are cash rich right now, right, we go into a correction or we ever go into the next"
"7650060","7651760"," bear market, not ever, but we will. "
"7652560","7654820"," That you do not blow up your fucking accounts."
"7655720","7658320"," Because there's a ton of money in there, right?"
"7658540","7659740"," You don't want to lose that."
"7660500","7665060"," And there's a bunch of other shit you have to do, but I want you to be aware that there"
"7665060","7669400"," are easy mechanics for you to see if you should not be buying the fucking dip. "
"7670460","7670880"," Simple."
"7673220","7676760"," If you see price below that hourly trigger, you're not a fucking buyer of dips."
"7677120","7677260"," You understand?"
"7678160","7678700"," Krista Claire. "
"7680560","7685860"," You'll be on trend for a long time above that that make tons of money above that hourly trigger."
"7686800","7688700"," Anytime or below that hourly trigger, you are a seller."
"7689520","7690240"," Does that make sense?"
"7690600","7691940"," For below that hourly trigger, you're a fucking seller. "
"7692340","7693200"," You are selling the rip."
"7693420","7696920"," Even if it's tactful, even if it's just like boom, I'm selling this."
"7697280","7698280"," No, we're not going to zero. "
"7698920","7701180"," We're just going down to the daily trigger, right?"
"7701540","7703080"," We're going to go step by step by step."
"7703080","7705760"," Same for the same for a bulls, right?"
"7705760","7706880"," To the upside, right?"
"7707060","7708040"," You know your step by step."
"7708280","7709760"," We zigging fucking zag. "
"7709920","7710700"," We don't go straight up."
"7711100","7712240"," We don't go straight down."
"7712460","7714000"," I know it seems like in our one minute chart. "
"7714560","7715360"," And one more thing."
"7715580","7717760"," Back to that person that was asking about the fear."
"7719780","7724460"," When you take a step back from the market, what I found was if I had fear to take a"
"7724460","7727780"," trade, it's because I was trading a fucking one minute trigger. "
"7728800","7731040"," Or I was trading a five minute trigger."
"7731700","7734500"," Or maybe I was normally trading a 15 minute trigger."
"7734500","7736640"," Like I'm comfortable in a 15 minute trigger. "
"7737100","7741860"," So if you have paralysis and trades, I want to tell you to scale out a little bit."
"7742660","7744280"," Just take a breather, scale out."
"7744680","7748820"," Open up a fucking, open up a fucking, hold on, what's the top of a trigger screen?"
"7749220","7751440"," Take a moment, breathe. "
"7752640","7754360"," So we're in a one minute trigger right now."
"7755020","7756260"," Let's look at a 30 minute trigger."
"7758740","7760180"," Where are we right now?"
"7761180","7762080"," Let's look at it. "
"7762180","7762700"," Where are we?"
"7763720","7765740"," Let's scale out of the doom really quick."
"7767600","7769460"," It's been working for bulls every time."
"7770640","7771640"," Like a dance, right?"
"7771940","7777080"," One and two, you buy the dip and three, you buy the dip and where are we at right now?"
"7777920","7778340"," Buy the dip. "
"7779900","7780380"," Right?"
"7781480","7782320"," That's so bad, right?"
"7785180","7786780"," Is that all doom and gloomish anymore?"
"7787420","7787880"," Fuck no."
"7789440","7791100"," It's been working regular for how long?"
"7791100","7791860"," You want to show you?"
"7792940","7793580"," Want to see it?"
"7794440","7795440"," How long has it been working for?"
"7796700","7797540"," Paul, you want to see it?"
"7799740","7800820"," So let me ask you this."
"7803080","7803920"," Let me ask you this. "
"7804080","7804240"," You ready?"
"7806340","7808640"," Let me ask you a question right here."
"7812960","7814080"," Was the market going to crash here?"
"7814340","7814520"," Yes."
"7815740","7816960"," Was the market going to crash there?"
"7817080","7817260"," Yes. "
"7818420","7819600"," Was the market going to crash there?"
"7819720","7819860"," Yes."
"7821540","7823980"," Remember that big voice in the room that's telling you the crash is coming?"
"7824700","7824980"," Yes."
"7825140","7825840"," They set it there too. "
"7826220","7827060"," They set it right here."
"7827660","7828760"," They set it right, here."
"7829180","7833800"," They set it right here, set it right here, set it right, here, set it right, here and here. "
"7833800","7834880"," And what are they saying today?"
"7836320","7837520"," Right here, right."
"7838020","7839500"," There's another one down there, right?"
"7839900","7846280"," One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven."
"7848120","7850260"," You're telling me they were short all 11 times?"
"7852140","7853540"," That must be fucking rich. "
"7854180","7854720"," What are they doing?"
"7854860","7856720"," They fucking contacting their fucking banker friends?"
"7857360","7859140"," I'm down five million dollars right now."
"7859960","7861460"," I'm down a million dollars."
"7861900","7862600"," I'm down a hundred grand. "
"7863300","7864380"," Can you loan me another hundred grand?"
"7864580","7868920"," I've been making this prediction for the last eleven times and I fucking failed."
"7870100","7870580"," Right?"
"7871300","7872200"," Now will it eventually happen?"
"7872440","7873520"," Fuck that'll eventually happen."
"7874780","7876560"," But scale out a little bit is my point. "
"7876960","7880600"," If you're, if you have paralysis in trading, scale out a little bit."
"7880920","7882140"," What's the next thing that you can look at?"
"7882200","7883200"," Let's look at a one-hour chart."
"7884700","7885900"," What do we see right here?"
"7886900","7888240"," What a capy draw in here. "
"7889660","7891100"," Happy drew this in here right?"
"7891360","7892360"," Downside move right there."
"7893600","7894680"," You try to buy this shit?"
"7895060","7895520"," Fuck no."
"7896620","7898420"," Where do you want to be a buyer as a bull?"
"7898760","7900080"," Where everybody else is buying right?"
"7900620","7901760"," Down here down here down here right?"
"7902320","7905600"," You watch some of this stuff happen one, two, three, and you're like, yeah, you know what I get"
"7905600","7906480"," confidence back again. "
"7906480","7908040"," I'm gonna come back on the market and buy that shit."
"7908700","7909180"," Make sense?"
"7911400","7912140"," Known buyers."
"7914320","7915180"," Right down there. "
"7915340","7915680"," See it?"
"7916420","7917220"," Known buyers."
"7918040","7918960"," Let's see the next thing right?"
"7919140","7920480"," This is areas of interest right?"
"7921160","7922660"," Let's get a four-hour chart really quick."
"7925390","7926190"," And look at that. "
"7927110","7928210"," These four hours right?"
"7928550","7929090"," Bam all the way up."
"7929770","7931010"," Consolidate, bam all the way up."
"7931350","7932690"," Consolidate, bam all the way up. "
"7932690","7933430"," Consolidate."
"7933790","7935030"," And what do we have here?"
"7935370","7935830"," Bam."
"7936850","7937430"," Right?"
"7937570","7939570"," We got a nice little juicy squeeze right here right?"
"7939830","7943290"," Riding right back down again right?"
"7944850","7946530"," And what do you look right there?"
"7946590","7947870"," That might be it right there right?"
"7948430","7949350"," What is that?"
"7949890","7951910"," Five oh nine five oh ten right?"
"7952590","7954210"," So what are you trading now?"
"7954970","7955570"," Extremes. "
"7956030","7958510"," I'm trading an extreme right?"
"7960030","7962130"," If you're a seller where you're trading."
"7962710","7963330"," Extremes right?"
"7963850","7963850"," Extreme."
"7965530","7965990"," Extremes. "
"7967090","7967750"," Make sense?"
"7968590","7970750"," If you're a buyer, are you trading extremes?"
"7971810","7972710"," Yeah you are."
"7975940","7976560"," See it?"
"7977280","7978460"," No it can go against you."
"7978620","7980180"," Maybe you get squeezed out for a minute here. "
"7981620","7984520"," Maybe you get a little plunge protection team stepping in."
"7984700","7984840"," Remember that?"
"7985100","7987140"," I haven't used that term in like five years."
"7988780","7990400"," Remember the plunge protection team?"
"7992500","7994460"," Do they still use that out there?"
"7994560","7995400"," I don't know if they do or don't. "
"7995460","7997740"," But the plunge protection team."
"7998020","7999240"," So if you're a bull, where are you waiting?"
"8000220","8002220"," So what's our four hour chart?"
"8004020","8004860"," Where are you waiting?"
"8005560","8006280"," Right down here right?"
"8007000","8007960"," See him down here?"
"8008560","8009480"," Right fucking down here."
"8014350","8015950"," Let's look at it again in a one minute. "
"8017630","8018690"," Where are the buyers?"
"8021110","8022710"," Likely down here right?"
"8024250","8026310"," Where are we making our way to right now?"
"8027210","8028710"," What are all these guys right here?"
"8028850","8030470"," These are fucking fake buyers aren't they?"
"8031030","8032430"," Like yeah we're buying the dip."
"8032850","8036290"," It's like you're actually wanting to buy it down."
"8036430","8039090"," We want cheaper down here right?"
"8039950","8040210"," Cheaper. "
"8043150","8045150"," Let's keep an eye on it as the trade progresses."
"8048650","8049050"," Whew!"
"8050470","8051510"," Did I swear to God?"
"8052910","8059870"," I'm so stoked that we made this jump because we're going to create a whole other class of traders."
"8060790","8062350"," It sends you out there to be fucking monsters. "
"8072130","8072930"," Dude, chase."
"8073230","8075070"," I'm going to put you in a timeout man."
"8075850","8076810"," I'm serious man. "
"8077050","8078690"," I can't have you poisoned in the chat here dude."
"8079530","8080990"," I'm just going to do it right now, okay?"
"8082850","8083750"," I can't dude."
"8084210","8085670"," I can't do it dude. "
"8086410","8088270"," Like right one out of ten times I can't do it."
"8088310","8089010"," I can't have it man."
"8089770","8090790"," You're pluting the chat bro. "
"8093290","8095130"," This looks wonky right here too doesn't it?"
"8097230","8097930"," I can't."
"8098050","8099230"," I just leave right there."
"8099290","8100270"," Look how fucked up that looks. "
"8101130","8102070"," Hold on one second."
"8118950","8119550"," There you go."
"8119690","8120150"," Timeout time. "

"8136750","8143200"," Let me see if you guys are right in here."
"8149100","8151000"," I want you guys all up there to know that too."
"8151260","8153420"," I love Chase and I know each other outside of this. "
"8153780","8158000"," We're like we were very good friends so I love Chase."
"8158460","8159080"," Smart as fuck."
"8159680","8160880"," Great trader too by the way. "
"8161200","8165340"," I can't have it in the chat right now."
"8169680","8171660"," Thanks Jimmy for jumping in the chat right there."
"8171760","8172280"," I appreciate it. "
"8172660","8173840"," Jimmy is a moderator by the way."
"8177660","8179880"," A young trader saying it puts a recovering free losses."
"8180060","8181000"," Congratulations young trader. "
"8183220","8184400"," Yeah you guys want some beer music?"
"8184980","8185780"," Definitely I'll put it on for you."
"8187800","8190980"," Give me one quick second here and I'm going to give you guys an update here in just a moment."
"8191260","8194219"," So if you're looking for what to expect the rest of the day, give me a moment and I'm going"
"8194219","8195520"," to give you an expectation of the clothes. "
"8195520","8196680"," Just give me five seconds here."
"8198959","8200379"," Hey by the way Nino."
"8201459","8204660"," Was it Rivian that came out and there was like they're going to be bankrupt?"
"8205340","8205980"," Was that Rivian?"
"8207580","8210900"," I saw it on Twitter like two or three days ago and I never followed up. "
"8211580","8213360"," What car company was going to be bankrupt?"
"8214200","8214980"," Oh it's Fisker."
"8215520","8216760"," It was fucking Fisker."
"8216879","8217559"," It was Fisker. "
"8221290","8223450"," All right do you want me to put Chase back in?"
"8223570","8224209"," All right hold on Chase."
"8224969","8226730"," I'm going to take you out of time out."
"8228709","8237200"," Can I take him out of time out?"
"8237600","8238480"," I might have fucked up. "
"8245670","8247629"," I got to try to take Chase off time out."
"8247790","8249350"," Sunday never ends like let him fucking rain."
"8249910","8251450"," Hold on let me see if I can get him out of time out. "
"8251570","8251770"," Hold on."
"8259959","8261760"," Let me ask Bork if he knows how to do it."
"8262440","8265040"," I should have done that Chase. "
"8265680","8267900"," I just couldn't like it's like Chase Chase Chase Chase Chase."
"8268100","8269840"," It's not what he's saying it's like just too much."
"8271100","8272680"," Hold on Chase I'll get you back brother. "
"8272680","8273379"," Hold on give me a second."
"8278320","8280719"," Hold on I love Chase hold on one second."
"8281600","8283559"," Let me ask if I can leave Bork and help me. "
"8294459","8295799"," Maybe Bork can help me."
"8296180","8298100"," I can't do it from my side right now."
"8307920","8308719"," Can you see that?"
"8308719","8309680"," Remember if you're a bear right?"
"8309959","8311559"," I'm going to tell you something else if you're a bear okay?"
"8312100","8314840"," If you're a seller here it's the same as a..."
"8320110","8330299"," I can't seem to untime out from the"
"8330299","8331620"," screen I'm on. "
"8339020","8341240"," Pretty please could you untime him out."
"8345360","8347940"," Time him out."
"8348860","8349860"," I made a mistake. "
"8350639","8351559"," I made a boo boo."
"8353840","8355719"," I'm sorry Chase I should have done that man."
"8356680","8357760"," I apologize brother. "
"8358040","8360240"," We'll see if Bork can help you out here in just a moment."
"8364020","8369320"," Okay so if this was if this chart was upside down and this is a bull chart."
"8369459","8370660"," Can I flip this chart upside down?"
"8371360","8372959"," I would look I think I can on streamlabs. "
"8376299","8381700"," If you're at home and you have a TV monitor I want you to take your TV monitor and just"
"8381700","8382420"," rotate it."
"8382780","8385799"," And you'll be a bull again."
"8386280","8388760"," You're upside down bull you're upside down bear your bull. "
"8393440","8396260"," So pretend we're looking at a bull chart upside down okay?"
"8397660","8404520"," As long as you hold the one minute trigger as a bear and you hold the five minute trigger you're"
"8404520","8406420"," still heading to the downside okay?"
"8407720","8413320"," If you do lose the five minute trigger and price us let me just give her this."
"8417370","8425630"," If you do on a one minute or five minute check lose it you will be given a chance I"
"8425630","8426250"," promise you."
"8426250","8430890"," Now this is like a 90% chance you're going to be given a chance to exit. "
"8432110","8435190"," So you would if you if you like my stops are here cap right here."
"8435790","8446580"," Yeah your stops might be right here but you ain't actually going to execute the stop until the"
"8446580","8447480"," pullback here."
"8448500","8452840"," And you exit in an orderly manner doesn't matter if we roll back down. "
"8453700","8457860"," You're going to exit in an orderly manner you're short right here or your puts."
"8459000","8464380"," And you will reposition if you're still bearish only if we get a new low."
"8465960","8467540"," Let me draw it out better for you. "
"8470900","8472340"," How do I explain this better."
"8475680","8481120"," So if we go back to check the five minute trigger we break higher and your thesis is still lower."
"8481700","8483460"," You're going to wait for it to come back down. "
"8485320","8490500"," Right down there you're going to exit if it's your stop you exit here."
"8491260","8495120"," Okay now even if it's going to continue to roll down that's so we go up a little bit but"
"8495120","8496160"," it still goes down."
"8496520","8500380"," You just be Johnny on the spot waiting for a failure on this high. "
"8501200","8507660"," You wait over here and if the buyers fucking suck this will actually roll down."
"8509060","8509500"," Okay."
"8511860","8513740"," And that rolls down right there. "
"8514740","8516400"," Let's say you want to see that new low."
"8517260","8520900"," You're going to wait for one more pull higher right there."
"8522120","8524540"," And you're going to jump right the back back in on it okay. "
"8525880","8527480"," That's that whole thing right there."
"8528020","8529820"," You're going to jump right in Johnny in the spot."
"8530360","8532720"," And this fucker is going to blood right down to the depths of hell. "
"8533520","8535220"," High probability trade right there."
"8536200","8536680"," Okay."
"8538580","8540380"," Let's watch this play out right now. "
"8542800","8544800"," Let's watch this price action together."
"8550760","8551680"," Let's work here."
"8553540","8554900"," Oh there's no way to do it. "
"8558960","8563380"," All right so we're going to try to moderate give him a moderator position or something like that"
"8563380","8564000"," for the day."
"8564620","8565640"," I'm sorry Bork."
"8565780","8566260"," I messed up. "
"8568940","8570100"," I was a little too aggressive."
"8570440","8572520"," I think I gave him a 24 hour timeout or some shit."
"8572760","8573200"," Like that's it. "
"8573380","8574100"," Can't have it in the chat."
"8574600","8575700"," Now I'm trying to give a lesson."
"8575840","8576540"," I'm like I can't have it. "
"8582560","8584060"," The cross has not happened."
"8584760","8585980"," Do you seek good question?"
"8586800","8589280"," Do you see a cross of the one and five minute trigger yet?"
"8590080","8590200"," No."
"8591360","8593800"," Do you see a back check of the one and five minute trigger yet?"
"8594140","8594420"," No. "
"8595500","8596400"," Price back check."
"8596600","8597100"," Back check."
"8598820","8599780"," How are we reversing?"
"8600500","8602480"," Maybe we looked at the one in the five hour. "
"8602500","8603400"," Pretty close are we?"
"8604240","8606040"," Pretty close to where the buyers are right?"
"8606780","8607780"," We just looked at a one minute."
"8607880","8608600"," I'm a one hour chart."
"8608860","8609800"," Not a four hour chart. "
"8609980","8610540"," 30 minute chart."
"8610960","8612440"," This is kind of the place that we reverse."
"8613460","8615000"," But we don't have price to prove it yet. "
"8617920","8619840"," I know I shouldn't have done that 24 hours."
"8620500","8621100"," I got aggressive."
"8621260","8621580"," I'm sorry. "
"8622200","8622700"," I fucked up."
"8625320","8625680"," Yeah."
"8625800","8627420"," Oh, Chase, go over to the Twitch side. "
"8627800","8628920"," Hey, thanks, Mr. Talking Monkey."
"8629660","8631020"," Chase, jump over to Twitch."
"8635020","8636440"," Jump over to the Twitch side, brother. "
"8636640","8636880"," Start chatting."
"8639460","8640920"," Come to the dark side on Twitch."
"8655420","8656980"," Come join us on Twitch, Chase. "
"8657620","8658420"," We want you over there anyways."
"8659040","8660000"," Come to the good side."
"8661960","8663400"," You want to hang out, Jimmy Barry?"
"8663720","8666640"," You want to hang out with the people over on Twitch?"
"8668620","8669520"," Come to the shadow. "
"8670880","8672160"," The shadow room."
"8674700","8677780"," Oh, look at that right there."
"8677940","8679320"," Look at these fucking bears, man. "
"8681300","8685260"," If you're a Barry, like we're building the wall of resistance to the bulls right now."
"8686580","8688960"," We're turning support into resistance."
"8690360","8692980"," This is the line right here for bears. "
"8693400","8699260"," Not only that, we have now turned this green into yellow."
"8700840","8701440"," Doom."
"8704180","8707180"," We've also turned this support that the bulls had right here. "
"8708720","8710260"," Oh, yeah, I love it."
"8711060","8712300"," Bathe me in blood."
"8717000","8718200"," Oh, yeah. "
"8720960","8729800"," We also have the hourly trigger coming down right now to reinforce the idea that the bears own the"
"8729800","8730600"," market now."
"8732040","8733440"," Me the crash commence."
"8738940","8742800"," I'll put the music on for the bears right now because I know this might be short-lived. "
"8743560","8746200"," They need to get some glory here."
"8751470","8752130"," Hold on."
"8752230","8753570"," We're going to put on some bear music. "
"8755610","8757130"," What do you guys think we should play?"
"8758870","8760250"," DMC safe music."
"8762170","8765610"," Chatting bear music and deep low beats."
"8768410","8770390"," Let's play space. "
"8770730","8771010"," Ambient."
"8771250","8771710"," Chilling high."
"8771930","8772230"," They get high. "
"8772390","8773910"," These got a little hard underground techno."
"8773910","8775190"," That's some bear shit right there."
"8776350","8777950"," They're probably cyborgs too. "
"8779570","8780050"," Ooh."
"8781650","8782130"," Ooh."
"8784230","8784810"," That's aggressive. "
"8788370","8789430"," That's super aggressive."
"8791150","8793030"," What if we go over to 18 plus webcam?"
"8795450","8796830"," Oh, hardest BDSM."
"8796950","8797870"," Technically always like that. "
"8798010","8798570"," It's one of our favorites."
"8800050","8801630"," They got to rub that bear belly right there."
"8807630","8807930"," Bears. "
"8809050","8814290"," At the top of the key this morning selling it down, getting an extension to the downside."
"8814910","8817250"," They got their first rip down to the hourly trigger."
"8817650","8821070"," They're able to clean up this morning below the hourly trigger. "
"8821570","8823590"," Hourly trigger now sits at 516."
"8824730","8825330"," 515."
"8825610","8826010"," 91. "
"8827510","8830890"," Trying to create some resistance from up on high right now."
"8830910","8834330"," They're going to test their five minute trigger likely at 514."
"8834330","8834530"," 15. "
"8835050","8837270"," They have another target to the upside of 514."
"8837910","8838390"," 59."
"8838730","8841130"," And right now it's 1.43 in the afternoon. "
"8841670","8850050"," At the 2 PM hour up here, I'm going to assume that as we come into 2.30, you're going"
"8850050","8852130"," to see something like that happen."
"8852230","8853250"," We're going to bloodbath down."
"8854510","8856770"," So pay attention to the two o'clock hour. "
"8868340","8869260"," Doom, baby."
"8872530","8874130"," How much doom for Tesla?"
"8874130","8875790"," We have to talk about Tesla today."
"8876390","8879490"," As a matter of fact, let's talk Tesla. "
"8880410","8884470"," Let's talk Tesla around the three o'clock hour."
"8884670","8886210"," We're at the end of the day today for OpEx."
"8886410","8888630"," We're not OpEx, but the day before GiveEx, as you say. "
"8891650","8893010"," We're going to chat Tesla today."
"8894610","8899550"," And if you are not a pro supporter, pro supporters get Tesla updates, I think every day."
"8900350","8904630"," So just so you know, if you're not getting Tesla updates because you're not a pro trader, but if"
"8904630","8906270"," you're a pro trader, you get every single day. "
"8912040","8913200"," Below the quarterly trigger."
"8913740","8914460"," Has it rejected?"
"8914460","8915320"," It's a good question."
"8915780","8917480"," Has it rejected the quarterly trigger?"
"8917680","8918240"," That's what I want to know. "
"8922950","8923530"," Elga's 91."
"8923910","8925370"," Has it rejected the quarterly trigger?"
"8926270","8930510"," And you have the weekly coming down on it and the daily coming down on it."
"8946780","8948100"," Dude, this is so ugly. "
"8948300","8948940"," Can I change that?"
"8951440","8952480"," Let's go right below it."
"8953780","8954880"," It doesn't look good."
"8955360","8956800"," That looks so much better, doesn't it?"
"8960660","8962400"," We'll even draw this one up here for the bears. "
"8962720","8962920"," Hold on."
"8963920","8965160"," If they're going to check this."
"8970510","8970910"," Whoa. "
"8981430","8982810"," Yeah, that's so nice, isn't it?"
"8987080","8988760"," Dude, this music is killing me here."
"8990420","8998420"," It's like, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't."
"8999800","9001440"," I got it on a beat. "
"9001640","9002280"," I hardest BDS."
"9002700","9003080"," How about this?"
"9003220","9006780"," If you're a bear, I've been giving all kinds of free reign to the bulls."
"9007400","9009640"," If you're a bear, here, I'll stop that music. "
"9010520","9014620"," We're going to get demonetized today for the bears."
"9015040","9016760"," So we're going to demonetize the channel today."
"9018940","9020600"," What song would you like?"
"9020600","9022340"," Don't, don't overload me with songs. "
"9022620","9023420"," They're going to fly by it."
"9023420","9024120"," I'm going to miss them."
"9024440","9026700"," You're going to, you're going to then start spanning them in the chat. "
"9026900","9027360"," Don't do that."
"9029060","9031460"," So a lot of that music was removed from YouTube."
"9031860","9034560"," They said, like, some of it's still there, but some of it's not. "
"9036340","9036980"," And yeah."
"9040600","9042020"," Hold on a second here."
"9042280","9042740"," Oh, wait a minute. "
"9042880","9043140"," Hold on."
"9048800","9050960"," Let me see if we can find that bear music."
"9051180","9051400"," Hold on. "
"9051580","9053080"," I think I can't use it anymore."
"9053080","9055100"," Some of it I can, but let me check right now."
"9057040","9057420"," Hold on. "
"9057500","9057940"," Let me see if I got it."
"9058060","9058720"," Dude, I got no more."
"9058840","9059780"," Dude, they took that shit away. "
"9060480","9061280"," Hold on a second here."
"9065240","9068320"," I went back into check for music."
"9069680","9070380"," Oh, wait a minute. "
"9070500","9070780"," Wait a minute."
"9071060","9071440"," Wait a minute."
"9074680","9077900"," Oh, shit. "
"9090050","9091270"," Some of you know this song."
"9093390","9094670"," We could crank it for you."
"9096550","9096990"," No!"
"9141370","9149560"," Oh, yeah. "
"9150300","9152960"," Blood, baby."
"9164240","9165100"," Blood, baby."
"9169100","9178000"," Blood on SPX Gamma. "
"9184780","9188280"," Bears, trying to keep it down."

"9230800","9232220"," They keep playing over and over."
"9232500","9232660"," They're not."
"9232800","9232880"," They're not. "
"9232880","9232960"," They're not."
"9233080","9233120"," They're not."
"9234280","9235820"," They only know one country song. "
"9235980","9237200"," So they play it like 30 times."
"9241000","9241660"," Oh, hold on."
"9241760","9242640"," I got one more for you. "
"9242940","9244700"," David AMS has got a song for you."

"9469740","9469940"," Yep."
"9471120","9478180"," Three-way lonely island. "
"9500050","9501610"," I want you to watch one quick thing here."
"9501790","9503990"," I'm going to remove some of this really quick."
"9504550","9505670"," I don't want you to get fucked up in here. "
"9505830","9505990"," Hold on."
"9507170","9511700"," I want you guys to see this here."
"9512300","9513100"," Hold on one second here. "
"9524420","9526000"," Too much shit in the goddamn thing."
"9526940","9527980"," If you're at home, watch."
"9528220","9528600"," Oh, wait a minute. "
"9530120","9531800"," Watch this right here if you're at home, okay?"
"9543100","9544100"," Let me show you this."
"9544760","9546180"," Let me mute this for a minute here."
"9546460","9548420"," We're having fun times, but I just want to do something here for you. "
"9550760","9553180"," So, if you are a bear, what are you looking for?"
"9554460","9555720"," A failure, right?"
"9556780","9558720"," You do not want to see what?"
"9559720","9561740"," You don't want to see buyers above, do you?"
"9563060","9564900"," If you see the buyers above, what happens?"
"9570630","9573590"," You're going to go right there."
"9579120","9580760"," I got to stop with this pink shit."
"9580960","9581640"," I like pink. "
"9582320","9583240"," I'm not used to it."
"9583280","9584180"," I like the whites clean."
"9584480","9584900"," Yeah, there we go. "
"9584900","9585320"," Right there."
"9587260","9589280"," If you're a bear, what do you want to see here?"
"9589720","9591280"," So, I draw these lines in every day."
"9591320","9591560"," Why?"
"9593180","9594700"," Because I want to see if we fail it. "
"9594880","9597840"," If we fail to get this, it means we're going to get a reversal."
"9598280","9599620"," So, keep your eye on this."
"9600320","9603860"," If they fail this, we're going right down to the depths of hell, okay?"
"9604520","9605700"," So, just keep watching this. "
"9606540","9610820"," I know it looks wonky, but it looks kind of wonky, doesn't it?"
"9611180","9612160"," Right about there."
"9613960","9615920"," And right about there."
"9616580","9617720"," I got to clean this up a little bit. "
"9618740","9623140"," And then right about there, right about there, right there."
"9623960","9625100"," So, I got to clean this shit up."
"9625160","9625720"," It doesn't look good. "
"9626460","9627700"," And it's not showing the new highs."
"9628100","9629840"," Now, I don't mean that we're going there."
"9630140","9630780"," Don't take this. "
"9630960","9631600"," We're bearish here."
"9632180","9633360"," I want to see a failure."
"9633860","9635560"," So, if you're a bear, you want to be watching this, right?"
"9635720","9640040"," If we start failing this right now, that's going to fucking blood down the depths of hell. "
"9642420","9644040"," All right, let's get back to that song again."
"9645160","9646200"," And I'll be quiet."
"9649480","9682060"," Op-ex"
"9682060","9682560"," with Tesla. "
"9683480","9685440"," We'll tell it at 3 p.m. But think about Op-ex at Tesla."
"9688180","9693260"," If we want to maximize profit on a ticker like Spy, right?"
"9693500","9694440"," We blast it through the moon."
"9694980","9700340"," Do you want to maximize profit on Tesla to the downside at Op-ex?"
"9700700","9702240"," It's the same concept in reverse. "
"9708010","9709830"," I'm going to take a five minute break to my voice."
"9709990","9710790"," It's killing me, okay?"
"9710790","9715630"," I should call, and it's killing me."
"9716810","9719130"," Ooh, ooh, ooh. "
"9719150","9720910"," My camera will still be here."
"9721870","9722870"," I'll wait."
"9724830","9731700"," Ooh, at this time, I'll take the day, yeah. "
"9736800","9738680"," I'll never wait."

"10438980","10446600"," like straight down wam or squeeze up and straight down like be very careful with no confirmation"
"10446600","10455740"," here very dangerous very rare to see that very very very very careful now if you're a bull if"
"10455740","10464980"," you are a bull I'm gonna mute this for a minute here if you are a bull right because"
"10464980","10472460"," take note of this because we are underneath remember what I said to you earlier because we are"
"10472460","10481500"," underneath the hourly trigger you are not in safety yet listen to that closely we are not in safety"
"10481500","10486920"," yet and the reason being is because we're underneath the hourly trigger this is a trap for bulls"
"10486920","10494580"," now we can break above but we're still not above the hourly trigger if this if this was going on"
"10494580","10500220"," above the hourly trigger it'd be a fucking baller setup for bulls but you're underneath it right"
"10500220","10505880"," now so no matter how we get there whether we get there like a scream up the initial reaction is"
"10505880","10511640"," likely going to be a rejection back down to this one in five minute trigger at minimum so I want"
"10511640","10518620"," to warn you if you are a bull you don't get bullish until we are above right here okay so"
"10518620","10525700"," no matter what this action is up here you want to be with a confirmation down below on the half"

"10530940","10536760"," there okay just right there because we are underneath that that hourly trigger this is an extremely"
"10537640","10544480"," dangerous place for bulls you can trade this as a bull for five minutes you can trade that for five"
"10544480","10549740"," minutes if you want but I'm warning you I'll give you one warning I gave it to the Bears yesterday"

"10560560","10567540"," it but not below it so be very extremely careful here in this action right here it looks more like"
"10567540","10574300"," a squeeze than buyers see how it's just going straight up right now that shouldn't be happening so"
"10574300","10578780"," this looks like a squeeze to me this doesn't look like real buyers to me just be extremely careful"
"10578780","10586960"," I'm going to remove this red box here so you can see it but like right here like extreme careful"

"11433340","11439680"," just looks like range expansion yeah it's it's not or you know like if you're you know like a T "
"11439680","11444740",".A. nerd or something it's kind of be like hey that's kind of like forming like a pennant you know"

"11468500","11476040"," they're partnering with NVIDIA in like this AI setting or this data center setting and all of that"
"11476040","11482000"," jazz so like it's a positive thing and like like it's supposedly a positive thing you know like if"
"11482000","11487780"," we were like touching a thousand before like that event even like happened I'll be like oh man this"
"11487780","11495060"," is gonna be a seldom used thing yeah that's right that's right what we have upside you do kind of"
"11495060","11499360"," like seeing that's what I kind of like seeing in like Apple's earnings too you know like I like I"
"11499360","11504440"," like it when Apple like does not run into earnings it kind of like falls into earnings dude every"
"11504440","11511920"," single time man yeah have I told you the theory of the Apple dude I've used to trade Apple dude"
"11511920","11517340"," for years I would if we ran into earnings a few times they have split but other than that always"
"11517340","11524940"," bad fucking news yeah it's yeah sell the news yeah sell the news I kind of feel like since late"
"11524940","11531000"," covid like since like when lockdown started to end and stuff what I've started noticing in"
"11531000","11539080"," quarterly earnings or Apple is that they'll be like a news article like a week or two weeks before"
"11539080","11546820"," Apple's earnings saying like setting the bar really low being being like hey Apple's gonna like you"
"11546820","11552600"," know China stuff is not going that well or you know the empty chip did not sell as many units"
"11552600","11559160"," in like the desktop market and whatnot you know news like that will come out it'll start a dungeon"
"11559160","11565220"," on the stock and then Apple will come out and basically you know give really good news and Apple"
"11565220","11571060"," stock just jumps on an ER and it's kind of really funny like watch that happen because I'm like at"
"11571060","11576200"," least the last three quarters it's happened like I've noticed there's like bad news that comes on"
"11576200","11582660"," like two weeks before ER and you know Apple doesn't like kind of tax into ER and then kind of"
"11582660","11586960"," like pumps a little bit off of ER then eventually like it might fail it might fail not not fail"
"11586960","11593200"," so I kind of feel like they always try to control the narrative when Apple's ER is speaking of"
"11593200","11601000"," Apple last I checked Apple was up on the day it googles up to man yeah so it's kind of"
"11601000","11607800"," like we're seeing a Netflix still looks sexy as hell too yeah the cues are like barely read but"
"11607800","11617160"," what is QQQ yeah that QQQ is more read"
"11617160","11625520"," that is 0.64 percent down compared to 0.12 on on that but even that is getting to the"
"11625520","11630680"," point that we're sitting on the daily trigger and you like you should buy this tip on QQQ like this"
"11630680","11635880"," is a tech tip to buy yes well a couple of things too just quickly looking at that right there"
"11635880","11640580"," skill that back in a NASDAQ see how crazy it gets down there when you do touch the daily trigger"
"11640580","11645940"," and you're like we're in a one-minute chart and everybody's like doom and you see some explosive"
"11645940","11652480"," down B-shaped recoveries that are hella hella volatile right we just look at that action that took"
"11652480","11660240"," place down there yeah like this is the 20 this is the 21st of February like area like we're on"
"11660240","11666360"," noon it just kind of like went under the daily trigger and then next day where were we on the"
"11666360","11673660"," 22nd at 8 a.m feel like right up here you know it like negated all that entire book so"
"11673660","11680960"," you know we are getting like we just had the daily trigger it's I expect like this to be like"
"11680960","11686080"," a massive bounce into tomorrow or something tomorrow or Monday there's the other thing too I kind"
"11686080","11693140"," of wanted to talk about this I was looking at NVIDIA today because you know last week in video on"
"11693140","11700560"," Friday that's U of DTE play it was like a 2,500 percent play when people bought puts and today"
"11700560","11707420"," it's an NVIDIA like going into today like thanking this much I just feel like it's kind of crazy"
"11707420","11716740"," how they've sold 1.31 billion of call delta and bought 234 million of put delta"
"11716740","11726460"," so that's like 1.5 1.6 billion total negative delta it's kind of come off since uh oh man"
"11726460","11733620"," um it's kind of come off a little bit since like one uh 20 or so but that's just kind"
"11733620","11738420"," of impressive like people are like getting out of NVIDIA why why are they getting out of NVIDIA"
"11738420","11747400"," right now so that's kind of interesting to me and I was looking at like trying to like read the"
"11747400","11753540"," the put-and-call level so 870 was the put wall we went and tagged that we bounced from that"
"11753540","11760220"," today I bring this life crisis up you will see we went and tagged we went under there and every"
"11760220","11765060"," time that happened we have you know it's like a magnet dude yeah so the put wall is a good"
"11765060","11771460"," area always to like kind of take longs off of the magnet is this hedge wall at 875 but we've"
"11771460","11778740"," got the call wall right above at 900 and there's a significant amount of gamma there and if I pull"
"11778740","11791340"," up the history uh let me make this a little bit bigger so you guys can see uh so"
"11791340","11798820"," what you see here like is the call wall was at a thousand uh last week well to begin the"
"11798820","11806200"," week on the 11th and it since then it's kind of gone down to 19 900 and kind of stayed"
"11806200","11815880"," at 900 but tomorrow 315 is a top gamma expiry and a top delta expiry for about 50 percent of"
"11815880","11822320"," the gamma on NVIDIA is going to expire today and about a quarter of all the delta is going to"
"11822320","11825660"," expire sorry if he's going to expire tomorrow and a quarter of all the delta is going to expire"
"11825660","11831360"," tomorrow and 75% of puts are going to expire tomorrow and that made me really think like okay what"
"11831360","11836680"," the hell like why are so many puts expiring and you know about 65% of the calls expiring so"
"11836680","11844020"," when we go to the put and call um chart again see like there might be a whole bunch of"
"11844020","11851160"," these puts that are expiring so that could actually give a lift to NVIDIA into close tomorrow I was"
"11851160","11857440"," thinking about that about Tesla too yeah yeah Tesla by the way is of the quarterly trigger let's"
"11857440","11861520"," look at Tesla we can yeah they're the they're quarterly trigger and you're going to get quarterly"
"11861520","11868480"," puts expiring yeah and so let me let's look at that so the put wall was at 170 so we're"
"11868480","11877680"," below below that right now I need I need a I need to hit 200 by the 28th or something"
"11877680","11884860"," oh yeah are you going long I've been long yeah you're in that call spread right I mean calls for"
"11884860","11891800"," I mean calls for I got I was green and then they rolled it down but I'm still in like"
"11891800","11896200"," this I didn't really get them too too much too far outside the money yeah so I just needed to"
"11896200","11899960"," come back by the 28th but I don't know or like next week at some point and I was hoping"
"11899960","11906040"," for much higher I think we're at 170 this morning so I'm like yeah it's not I think it was"
"11906040","11912360"," 170 or something like that this morning I might lose that trade but yeah of the four or five trades"
"11912360","11920260"," a minute it's the only one that I'm really afraid of gotcha yeah I did um okay come on Tesla"
"11920260","11926100"," it's like I got logged out that's crazy it's never but yeah let me just pull up all that logs"
"11926100","11934600"," in um Tesla yeah man so it's it's down at all the way up the poorly trigger I know I"
"11934600","11942120"," saw that earlier today yeah it's like below it last time it was a poorly trigger a poorly trigger"
"11942120","11947440"," was at like 138 and it went down all the way to like 103 so that's like a $35 down"
"11947440","11955460"," so like we're higher if we go like another $30 down from here like around 130 like I might start"
"11955460","11963040"," accumulating shares at that point um I don't know man there's there's too much drama with with Musk"
"11963040","11964820"," right now man dude what's going"
"11964820","11974740"," on with him he was the"
"11974740","11979920"," reason the stock went up that much and now he's the reason the stock's going down and plus you know"
"11979920","11985300"," um EV seem to be dying in general in the market like 2024 is not the year of the EV"
"11986200","11992020"," so people are realizing that hybrids are still the best of both worlds technologies that are out"
"11992020","11999080"," there so and in a lot of cases more value for money compared to what you get with an EV"
"11999080","12005660"," just because of the high costs of the metals um they're going to an EV so uh you know I"
"12005660","12015640"," I kind of do feel that Tesla is not really a I mean the stock is trading a stock is"
"12015640","12021500"," different than you know the company right we all agree I agree with that yeah I just feel like"
"12021500","12029840"," there's oh right now there's like the macro narrative 80s is weighing down on the sector and you"
"12029840","12036420"," know Tesla is healing that pressure so uh Joe and I were having a congress it was a sense of"
"12036420","12041200"," weird things I keep getting asked on twitter about this and uh people are like what do you think"
"12041200","12046280"," about Tesla here and I was like well I was like it's going to get rolled down to the depths"
"12046280","12051940"," of hell so I have two conversations going on on twitter right first conversation is they're like"
"12051940","12056560"," where are we going I go well we're probably going down to but this is when we're this is when"
"12056560","12063600"," we're bouncing I'm like we're probably going or I don't even know where to see that uh you go to"
"12063600","12069060"," the where we are right now the third bounce higher where we are on the quarterly trigger it's not"
"12069060","12074440"," that one but the two above it uh people were were like what are your thoughts on Tesla here and"
"12074440","12081720"," I've got like I got two fucking thoughts I've got um a thesis that my main thesis is that we"
"12081720","12088460"," are going down to at least close the gap at the prior big low that we had down there so"
"12088460","12096780"," that I think that's at $96 there's one tiny gap that did not get closed um and that bothered me"
"12096780","12101560"," that they left it behind now that one right there is a big one then there's another gap down below"
"12101560","12110220"," in the 60s uh below that $76 uh whereas right now it's trading 78 down there that uh that's six"
"12110220","12115160"," month trigger right there's another gap down there just above it if you look there's a fucking gap"
"12115160","12120740"," down there right there fucking gap right there dude and uh I think we're ultimately going there but"
"12120740","12124620"," people are like well why are you buying calls and even when I bought them I was like the matter"
"12124620","12128240"," of fact on the stream I was like it's dangerous I was like this is the one time on the"
"12128240","12137960"," daily velocity being minus 100 that I'm not that we're in danger of the crash in Tesla right so"
"12137960","12145400"," you're still so I'm telling two stories for the same time uh what they did was they pinned Tesla as"
"12145400","12152360"," the daily trigger came down and crashing down on top so their net trade was a squeeze trade like we"
"12152360","12158460"," squeeze up the 200 bucks possibly 260 and what they fucking did was they fucking pinned it they"
"12158460","12163380"," didn't crash it they just pinned it long enough for that ship to come rolling down and now like"
"12163380","12168680"," you're losing your 260 becomes 240 then it comes to 20 and this is just the top end I thought"
"12168680","12173960"," 200 was was like hey I think I really very reasonable they just started dropping that ship down so"
"12173960","12182980"," uh now because of that pin you're seeing the roll down and roll down um and it's faster and more"
"12182980","12192500"," accelerated uh way so for me at least my ultimate thesis is I do see uh and have always seen"
"12192500","12197180"," the especially the past like three months and even six months we're going the fuck down to close"
"12197180","12201960"," those fucking gaps but that doesn't mean you can't trade it up from there anyways and the other"
"12201960","12209360"," scary thing for me always on Tesla dude is I have been in Tesla too many times with that thesis"
"12209360","12217260"," and watched it fucking rip 100 points in three days so yeah so let's I hope it prints me man"
"12217260","12221940"," I'm not in Tesla and you know like I think I diamond hit it to the fucking death because I"
"12221940","12226180"," I wouldn't be shocked to come in with like three days left and it just goes up 100 fucking points"
"12226180","12236120"," yeah I I know it's just like at this point 100 points on that to 260 well I'm telling me"
"12236120","12240860"," I've seen I've been I've been in those trades so I've seen I've had shit go from a dollar to"
"12240860","12246540"," twenty six dollars so yeah I've been in them I've made that money so yeah no I mean I've lost"
"12246540","12252080"," enough at this point in the fucking trade that I don't care yeah so anyways that this kind of like"
"12252080","12258540"," demand zone right yeah this is kind of like an area where we could see like a bounce that kind"
"12258540","12264360"," of fits in with the whole you know like 130 137 like that area like where I would want to"
"12264360","12269400"," say you think you're going to be just out hanging out there over there or no I think we're going"
"12269400","12273260"," to like try and get down there there's also another thing if you kind of like look at this it's"
"12273260","12278580"," kind of ugly I don't know if it plays a but this let me draw a line right here too"
"12278580","12286160"," um and there's this line down here cheat this bottom gold line if you guys can see it this bottom"
"12286160","12294280"," gold line cheat that as a neckline and it should be kind of higher I guess like technically it"

"12718780","12726440"," meanish but I see this bounce off of the weekly trigger and then it's kind of shown strength the"
"12726440","12733600"," daily trigger is climbing up with it so we see you got a nice little squeeze there right gorgeous"
"12733600","12743170"," squeeze yeah went and took the monthly trigger rejected off of that um"
"12743170","12749250"," I think it's going to consolidate here between here and the poorly trigger of all the daily catches"
"12749250","12754790"," up so I kind of want to start collecting shares on this I think it might be a good swing"
"12754790","12764500"," trade do that fucking we're in we're in this fucking pickle here with um we're in this fucking do"
"12764500","12773940"," this like we're we're literally tied into fifty one eighty and uh fifty one fifty yeah it's it's uh"
"12773940","12781620"," it's like two of the strongest gamma zones yep and so we noticed that last night I'm like you know"
"12781620","12786660"," the truth okay you trade for tomorrow would be that the pen is at five sixteen dude if they if"
"12786660","12793940"," they had had fuck if that those buyers had shown up on the open boom they didn't we had no"
"12793940","12799460"," none of that volume spike from that uh trade this morning no no okay so what are your thoughts here"
"12799460","12806340"," tell me what you think about block again tell me your thesis my thesis is uh a uh I think"
"12806340","12816320"," as well if the economy tightens you're going to see more usage of uh you know technology service"
"12816320","12822720"," by block okay um same thesis as like what people are saying about PayPal it's fintech it's kind of"
"12822720","12828820"," also beaten up if we are going to get loosening their business is going to go up to because"
"12829360","12834000"," businesses in general are going to make more money people are going to be out standing a little bit"
"12834000","12838740"," more so we're going to see that too so on both sides it kind of looks attractive plus on the"
"12838740","12847780"," chart on square um what I'm saying was it bounced off so weekly trigger I see the breakout forming"
"12847780","12855320"," here this is beautiful by the way yes so um I am breakout on uh on square no well I'm"
"12855320","12862480"," on a daily trigger here and you're from on the daily time zone and the the monthly is fucking"
"12862480","12869540"," beautiful like it is gorgeous for move higher gorgeous yeah so this is kind of what I'm thinking"
"12869540","12875680"," monthly bellow is really nice here yeah but it looks like it's going to go down in the not down"
"12875680","12880860"," up yes you going up I'm on the up trade I think you're going to get a squeeze dude I'm"
"12880860","12886980"," bullish here I don't want to buy options I kind of wanted to sit and chill here as with us"
"12886980","12894660"," many shares as I can collect I did buy some options today but there were 85 seats for next Friday"
"12894660","12899660"," and I bought them for 92 cents a piece and I only bought a handful so it's not even a"
"12899660","12905760"," big trade but I'm collecting shares I want to collect keep collecting shares around between the 80"
"12905760","12913800"," and the I want to say like 80 50 and like you know the 70 78 dollar range I think"
"12913800","12919980"," that's where I want to collect yeah I do want to say something to you yeah it's it's it trades"
"12919980","12928340"," like such a fucking meme even still I'm looking at it like when it bluds it bluds huge yeah and"
"12928340","12932900"," that's I don't want to do options I'm okay with holding shares yeah I wouldn't be a buyer of this"
"12932900","12943020"," unless it was right after a bloodbath it's up already from 60 to 80 93 so I'll be honest um"
"12943020","12948000"," I'd love to see like two weeks of blood maybe even a month or two of blood when this when"
"12948000","12952060"," this shit bluds it looked it looks like there's a gap down below here too right the needs closed up"
"12952060","12960780"," 69 13 oh man they're gonna go for it for just the means that's 69 13 I'd be down for"
"12960780","12969880"," that yeah something like that yeah I gotta use a different like I change the resolution so I can't"
"12969880","12975720"," really see candles I might have to turn all our triggers off I mean when that thing fucking bluds"
"12975720","12982480"," dude it's like a month and a half two months of just out straight selling right yeah yeah like like"
"12982480","12990360"," this thing right here when like I knew it and that was yeah that was about oh wow that's actually"
"12990360","12996440"," so this this candle right here is July I got an interrupt here just heads up you're getting a"
"12996440","13001320"," rollover right now in a spy they're trying to sell you down if you if you do get that second"
"13001320","13007400"," beer cross confirmation we're gonna go to the depths of hell right now to be extremely careful here"
"13009940","13018320"," down side target if the bulls lose this first target is the prior low at 5.12 75 but ultimately"
"13018320","13025180"," you're looking for target of 5.11 29 you extremely careful it's both across right now it'll go"
"13025180","13031180"," straight but straight red bar down to for about five minutes away from that happening it's 253"
"13031180","13040580"," seven minutes left until sour hour or power hour yeah oh man"
"13040580","13050280"," that's uh it's gonna be painful trade I was like it's gonna be painful but I'm just"
"13050280","13055700"," changing I'm I'm just putting in stops on these balls dude I'm up so that I made so much fucking"
"13055700","13059660"," money yesterday and today that I think that I don't care I want to say they do the creepy crawling"
"13059660","13067660"," up the wallie no it's devx day baby pay them dividends yeah they got a buy-in to close right"
"13067660","13073560"," I think they got well my own thesis the one problem for me was we didn't get the volume and"
"13073560","13079380"," the call buy in this morning so that's a fucking problem but it where they've been with it being um"
"13079380","13085940"," opx and devx you know they want they want to generate cash right so I'm gonna stay on this trade"
"13085940","13090120"," right probably to 4 or 15 I don't know if they're gonna if they do it at like between 4"
"13090120","13095680"," and 4 15 but I want to see if they take it away from people right as you can kind"
"13095680","13101500"," of see on my screen now there's about 4.8 billion of negative delta on the s&p 500 complex"
"13101500","13110120"," that came into bay and 3.48 billion of that was 0 d te see not those out and can"
"13110120","13117340"," kind of see but people did buy during the day there was a fair bit of longer dated call buying"
"13117340","13122520"," but I don't know the strikes off the top of my hand I'll have to see tomorrow but this 7"
"13122520","13129740"," billion of puts non 0 d te well including 0 d te box today and because 0 d t was"
"13129740","13136500"," about 3.75 billion of puts you're looking at an additional like negative delta and this negative"
"13136500","13144680"," delta is much larger than this positive delta um we look at the implied volatility chart the"
"13144680","13154170"," eyeball which is live let's compare it to yesterday and go to today and"
"13154170","13163230"," vol is for today it's yes it's a little bit higher by about six percent at spot but overall"
"13163230","13170630"," it hasn't gone up too much since closed yesterday and if you look at the term structure the term"
"13170630","13180430"," structure is still sitting within this 90th percentile and 10th percentile cone so this is"
"13180430","13189530"," today high day yeah exploration current vol spot vol is 19.87 percent"
"13189530","13199110"," tomorrow sorry on so tomorrow's vol is 14.32 percent and monday's vol"
"13199110","13208270"," is 9.58 percent so it's kind of telling me that they want to that nobody's really buying puts that"
"13208270","13215110"," much going into but it might be a little higher than where it was yesterday let's add that so we"
"13215110","13219790"," can see it it's a little bit higher you can see like the difference in the gray line and the"
"13219790","13229390"," and the key line it's a little bit but it's not not particularly you know high you know still"
"13229390","13236910"," for tomorrow it still remains less than 15 percent volatility so we'll see where the"
"13236910","13246630"," straddle goes up"
"13246630","13252170"," as we kind of sell into close i'm gonna actually hold on i'm gonna buy some calls for tomorrow too"
"13252170","13265390"," hold on here so yeah"

"13360560","13364860"," cobs sitting in calls for the end of the day today and for tomorrow they're dirt fucking cheap so"
"13364860","13374710"," there's another reason why i took them too and video is also um you know doing like"
"13374710","13381210"," some consolidation right above the five minute trigger um yeah i got us hit in five pointy by"

"13498460","13506860"," that's looking like if there's actually like uh calls on it uh interesting this is very very"
"13506860","13516340"," interesting you guys see this this is uh there was there was put there were put sold earlier on vix"
"13516340","13524250"," and some calls sold earlier like around the same time um and vix is right about the same price"
"13524250","13530470"," where it was at that point so this is earned a bunch of money um yeah this is telling me"
"13530470","13540230"," that vix might pump a little bit um into tomorrow because the light blue line is uh one uh well"
"13540230","13548350"," weekly vix calls the same short term vix is going to pump that's what they selling puts on it but"
"13548350","13554430"," long term outside of this nearest expiry uh they're selling calls on the vix so which means a"
"13554430","13561530"," longer term they think vix is going to go down again so um vix pumping means people are going to"
"13561530","13569290"," demand puts it's kind of tied into each other and we are kind of seeing that right we have seen"
"13569290","13577230"," heavy bid to the put site this blue line that keeps going down on dsq's complex which means that uh"
"13577230","13582730"," people expect major downsides and their vix is going to pop so that's kind of like that's why i was"
"13582730","13587130"," wanted to look at the vix because that will usually tell you like what the market is trying to do"
"13587130","13596190"," position wise going a small pop uh small pump into uh the next vix expiry and then a"
"13596190","13604710"," um then vix is going to get crushed again that's why they're selling calls on it so anyways um what"

"14362980","14368340"," good question so uh i can take this trade at 15 cents or six so i just took a i"
"14368340","14373580"," would try some zero dates on for six cents for today right and then i've got um some a trade"

"14383800","14388560"," any point and i don't make a bunch of money um i lose a ton of money right the risk"
"14388560","14394700"," reward for me is not there so if i'm spending ten cents twenty cents and i i have a DCA"

"14417300","14423460"," i'm putting risk on where it's dangerous uh so the potential profit for me is way different than"
"14423460","14427580"," being above now we're us being at the end of the day here it's like three it's what times we"
"14427580","14434380"," have three sixteen uh this is next div day so i don't believe this shit like if you know if"

"14445220","14451140"," a time for me to buy i'm not on a high so um so breakdown here somewhere i'm kind of"
"14451140","14455940"," happy right now and if you even if they burn i don't mind as a matter of fact i want"
"14455940","14463820"," to buy more five twenties if it continues to bleed right at fucking four p.m so i will add"
"14463820","14471340"," and add and add and add well i've only bought the two sets but if we continue down lower i"
"14471340","14485410"," will buy uh five twenties for tomorrow too uh yeah they're too cheap no reason not to yeah there's"

"14490570","14497230"," benefit off spx right i hear that fucking argument all the time too um so if i'm trading zero dates"
"14497230","14505230"," the only thing to trade is spy and that is why there's so much volume on it when you see"
"14505230","14512570"," dealers doing it when you see uh large players doing it it's because of the cost because nothing if"
"14512570","14518430"," they burn you're not blowing anything up it's great protection on the downside for underlying so"
"14518430","14524210"," let's say i own a stock for ten dollars let's say i own spy uh let's say i'm spy today"
"14524210","14530610"," right for five hundred and twelve dollars it is cheaper for me to load the fuck up out of uh"
"14530610","14537550"," dirt cheap zero date puts right so if spy goes up two or three bucks and i own fucking shit"
"14537550","14544670"," tons of spy shares those that hedging is so cheap on spy but i don't care so if we move"
"14544670","14549650"," up account for two or three bucks i'm fine if we move down right i'm going to cover that two"
"14549650","14555690"," or three dollars with massive like amplified games so i get asked a lot of times by retail traders"

"14977190","14981110"," eating and the climbing out of the hole it is hard now that might be for somebody but for me"
"14981110","14987350"," personally i'm unwilling to do that i pull my money out of the stock market i place my biggest"
"14987350","14994630"," trades are like fifty thousand dollar fucking spreads and that feeds me to trade day trade right"
"14994630","15000850"," zero dates gambling all that kind of stuff sometimes i win on the money that i give myself on zero"
"15000850","15006230"," dates and day trading sometimes i take a huge owl that week but i'm i'm going to tell you some"
"15006230","15012490"," i fucking sleep like a baby every single night some nights i don't when i'm holding overnight i'll"

"15017890","15023170"," that's what that habit comes from but i'm telling you guys out there it is no fucking fun if you've"
"15023170","15028130"," never been through it uh it is a hard fucking pill sorry all right i'm up don't want the rant"
"15028130","15034950"," let me go back to uh sorry about that oh no worries man i think uh everybody needs to hear"
"15034950","15041530"," that even i needed to hear that uh i've been trading futures um recently as i've mentioned yeah and"
"15041530","15045490"," i don't i have nothing against trading futures i got nothing against prop trade now the brother i"
"15045490","15049290"," get i like it i've done it i've done it i trade my own money i do it by a"
"15049290","15053830"," trade of eight so it's it's a little different yeah i've got no problem with people that trade"
"15053830","15059090"," futures i respect people that trade futures and i think jedi does as well and he trades futures too"
"15059090","15064510"," but there is a uh you know like a discussion that no one likes to have about it too right"
"15064510","15071830"," yeah man no i think everybody knows uh everybody who's chilling for apex or giving like their codes"
"15071830","15077870"," or whatnot affiliate codes they know they know how apex makes money i'm thinking more of the person"
"15077870","15082950"," that hasn't traded futures no i think jedi has made same distinction like if you've never traded"
"15082950","15091550"," futures or globex yeah it's also i i i i don't enter a trade without like clicking the button"
"15091550","15099790"," that's a stop loss that's a state profit yeah every trade has an upside target and a a stop loss"
"15099790","15104290"," because yeah i don't want to blow up an account you know and you got and that's why like i"
"15104290","15111370"," mentioned before uh futures trading is also brutal because of the leverage and so you have to uh"
"15111370","15117870"," time your entries just right and exactly right it's options are a little bit forgiving like you and"
"15117870","15124690"," i yeah well it's well and specifically spx is not nearly as liquid as spy is it no well yeah"
"15124690","15131570"," no it's not uh there's more contracts on as an uh on uh spy that are traded than spx contracts"
"15131570","15138630"," yeah and this and the price of spx so if some of the benefits spx is more stable right uh"
"15138630","15144510"," in volatility and pricing it's it's way more stable way more slow i think but do you disagree with"
"15144510","15150950"," that or no i don't think i necessarily agree with it i i you might have to explain what you"
"15150950","15160670"," mean exactly because i well oftentimes i'll ask people i'll say to them uh what's the uh if we go"
"15160670","15165270"," from if so he's always gonna i always get his great conversations with people i'll say to them"
"15165270","15170410"," always ask somebody i'll say okay if the uh sprite at the price of like right now if the price"
"15170410","15177050"," of spy is five five five or five hundred thirteen dollars right and we go to five twenty what's the"
"15177050","15183410"," price of the option on the zero day and i always get uh the technical answer to that right goes"
"15183410","15191570"," up a dollar rights per per dollar should go up right uh uh uh comparatively to your option right"
"15191570","15199910"," but that's not really true you can get spikes of premium and interest and uh volatility within that"
"15199910","15205390"," option especially options that don't have any intrinsic value um people say no no it'll never do"
"15205390","15212150"," that i'm like that's bullshit i've sat there on opens with people with demand and the price goes up"
"15212150","15216830"," even if the price isn't going up the price of the options going up while the price of the you"
"15216830","15222290"," know like do you know what i'm saying so within inside of those those spy options you can have real"
"15222290","15228870"," volatility in the value of those um options with no intrinsic value that have nothing to do with"
"15228870","15234770"," your with what you read in the book unlike to me at least spx seems to be more stable in"
"15234770","15242230"," pricing regardless of the velocity of price it's more stable to the the mathematical equation what"
"15242230","15249010"," should be worth the value that the radical value of the option is more pongruent and spx as opposed"
"15249010","15253910"," yeah it's a better way to say it oh yeah no i agree with that i could see uh i"
"15253910","15261490"," could uh see that happening um there's also the factor of ten right yeah you know that that options"
"15261490","15268650"," are expensive uh on spx um so i i really wish that you know there's a hundred bucks thousand bucks"
"15268650","15273290"," five grand not so bad laying out fucking fifty grand a day trade throughout the week you're gonna"
"15273290","15279070"," be in the fucking poor house right yeah right and so spx trades have to be like systematic and"
"15279070","15286110"," tactical for the average retail trader yeah i wish i i wish there was more liquidity on x sp which"
"15286110","15291690"," is i did i do too there's same tax structure for those that don't know it's the same tax structure"
"15291690","15299090"," as spx and it's one tenth so it's more pongruent with uh the price of spy um i wish more"
"15299090","15303870"," people would trade those i wish they did too but there's just no liquidity the spreads are like"
"15303870","15310890"," shit man other dog do their date they're scary yeah and plus it's not on robin it so is it"
"15310890","15318050"," not on robinhood no no there's a lot of traders don't know itself um i would like to see i"
"15318050","15324430"," i like that um product a lot and thesis but to get people over there no one like they i've"
"15324430","15327910"," been asked like when they first launched that they were asking me to say something or talk about it"
"15327910","15332830"," on twitter and i was like i don't know man i'd rather see another fucking five million people do it"
"15332830","15339910"," before i do it right so interesting thing if you guys can see my screen where my cursor is right"
"15339910","15348650"," now um that was the the deltas at close on friday when we kind of just melted during the day"
"15348650","15353730"," and i kind of tweeted about it too about how it was um you know one of the highest negative"
"15353730","15360930"," delta days i had seen um in a very long time on um on the euro indicator we're right about"
"15360930","15365610"," their re-ended that day with a negative delta of almost eight billion seven point eight seven"
"15365610","15373950"," billion and i like me as um options david i'm down with that you can get any of these options"
"15373950","15378730"," yeah that's true yeah i like that david's been making us uh talking about options on me on me as"
"15380710","15387130"," i like that too david i'm not talking about you either david i'm talking about like there's like a"
"15387130","15391810"," match it's not you it's not trader podcast but on twitter there's like this mantra you know and"
"15391810","15395570"," it's like it's like fed down everybody's throws i think that everybody has their own poison or"
"15395570","15402090"," their own uh risk tolerance uh it's like me with zero dates like if i'm trading zero dates if my"
"15402090","15408130"," account is a couple hundred grand and your account is five hundred bucks uh my risk is what point"
"15408130","15413170"," zero one percent but i'm risking and someone else is like this is my whole account i'm going back"
"15413170","15418070"," to uh work at pizza on friday if i blow it up i'm trying to build an account right now"
"15418070","15422390"," so even like they're even people's like what they're trying to do is different so i get that all"
"15422390","15428010"," that too um i just don't like the mantra that's out there that's like zero date traders suck and"
"15428010","15433370"," and i hear that on twitter like uh i mean i i joke that i'm a DJ and gambler but"
"15433370","15440550"," uh i don't get followed on i don't get followed on i'd say 70 percent of my trades especially here"
"15440550","15445830"," in stream too uh because it's boring right nobody wants nobody cares if i take on a trade that's a"
"15445830","15451410"," month out nobody cares if i take on a trade that's two weeks out or three months out or i"
"15451410","15455470"," buy a stock and hold it for six months nobody gives a fuck about that they want to hear like"
"15455470","15461810"," hey trade and zero dates today let's do it um yep that's that's all real right i don't know i"
"15461810","15468390"," think it's real let me ask you something yeah i have dixie up on my screen looks great i can"
"15468390","15477290"," see it um dollar or three it's good yeah and so the daily trigger is right above it yep"
"15477290","15485240"," you think dixie is about to put up daces get above daily trigger or it's going to be a hard"
"15485240","15494940"," time uh you know the thing about i like dixie around the dollar three zone um i think we"
"15494940","15502160"," do uh well not think but we know that we have the window for uh pricing to move now tomorrow"
"15502160","15511120"," or beginning tomorrow and monday um so my plan here is to um try to start buying a shit ton"
"15511120","15516540"," of 10 cent puts on stream moving to arm on the market briefs at night time like every time we're"
"15516540","15521620"," up at five five pointy or near it just throw on 10 cent puts for next week as it costs"
"15521620","15526740"," to do in business so that's my that's only my only plan there but that's the thing i think also"
"15526740","15533740"," we need to educate traders about is buying puts at these levels especially convex puts like the"
"15533740","15539200"," ones you're talking about is like buying insurance you don't buy a fire insurance or flooding"
"15539200","15547020"," insurance for your house hoping that a flood happens or a fire happens it's in there in case it"
"15547020","15552440"," happens and you don't lose everything right so it's the cost of doing business and that's the cost"
"15552440","15562320"," of your business yeah don't um i i i i don't want to um promote the"
"15562320","15566940"," thinking that you know we're going to die and we're going to continue dying because i'm really"
"15566940","15573140"," going to die uh but having puts to protect your portfolio especially if you own the market if you"
"15573140","15578440"," have money in the market if you're long shares yeah buying puts is is just the cost of buying"
"15578440","15584880"," hedges is that's what they call hedges right it gives you time to get up without losing massive"
"15584880","15589800"," value in your portfolio yeah i think i think i think we're like we have this whole discussion about"
"15589800","15592820"," are we going to go to the moon from here are we going to crash or we're going to have"
"15592820","15601460"," a uh thank you excuse me i mean the pain trade is sideways like like the pain trade is sideways"
"15601460","15606020"," but we like people like we're going up we're going down i'm like ah until we break below certainly"
"15606020","15611800"," if we break below the daily trigger and the the hourly trigger follows i will take the perspective"
"15611800","15620140"," of uh we're going to correct until then uh inputs are so cheap 10 cent puts for next friday sound"
"15620140","15627820"," awesome to me and not right here i don't want 10 cent puts right down here at five eleven either"
"15627820","15635300"," so anytime we're up on high by puts and um for next and this is for specifically for uh next"
"15635300","15640160"," friday and we've talked about this uh we talk about it in the uh market briefs all the time so"
"15640160","15647900"," right and i don't disagree with that uh anyways i well how about you do you think we uh we"
"15647900","15652200"," start going down straight down and it never comes back up do you think this is the role right here"
"15652200","15659780"," no i don't know i don't think this is the role uh i would i would honestly be waiting for"
"15659780","15667840"," confirmation for this to be a role you know um i think whenever i'm down here buying shit i get"
"15667840","15673760"," a lot of grief like i think that's a very common thing people are like yeah we're bloodin right now"
"15673760","15679660"," and i don't see a lot of people trying to long uh and then when i think we're on highs"
"15679660","15686020"," i get a lot of chatter about how bullish everybody is and then we roll down for a dip buy"
"15686020","15692980"," so i'd always prefer to be a buyer when we're doom and glooming it never when we're stoked i mean"
"15692980","15698400"," you can stay long if we keep pumping up and stuff like that on a higher time frame but um"
"15698400","15706020"," you know like you gotta buy the doom and not the not the happy all right so here's another thing"
"15706020","15715980"," to kind of contemplate cap uh we are at uh five twelve twenty one right now and the daily trigger"
"15715980","15722100"," is down at uh like five oh four fifty let's just call it that so here's the main switch over"
"15722100","15729920"," here go back to the main screen so i've got right here i've got uh this is the target for"
"15729920","15736020"," down below here right this is that green box and we're there right now uh i got the target it"
"15736020","15739180"," looks like i could be a little bit long or a little bit deeper than i want to be but"
"15739180","15745960"," five eleven fifty is what i've got and this has been drawn in since earlier today right that's the"
"15745960","15751340"," reversal you can actually see it right here nothing's changed i drew this for you earlier i come up"
"15751340","15756720"," here and i told you to be afraid of uh the sell down on the hourly trigger so we did"
"15756720","15762150"," sell down right here earlier in the conversation area said to always be afraid of the hourly"
"15762150","15766330"," trigger when you're below it and that's what we did right come straight back down bloodbath it down"
"15766330","15770990"," here i started buying calls right inside of here somewhere no i think i bought right here and i"
"15770990","15776290"," bought right yeah i bought some calls right here first set of calls i bought right there and this"
"15776290","15781730"," is for a one or a zero date squeeze into the bell right these are dead or i'm not dead"
"15781730","15789110"," yet it's still three thirty nine uh and then i bought some 420s right here for tomorrow uh five"
"15789110","15794630"," twenties excuse me for tomorrow for expiry on uh friday and those were dirt cheap too like hey"
"15794630","15804010"," kitty so like you know like 20 cent fucking 420s for tomorrow done yeah just straight done right"
"15804010","15812410"," done same as buying 10 cent puts on a high done easy no brain or trade let them burn right"
"15812410","15818110"," so cap uh sorry i'll so let me switch back again sorry brothers no no it's fine uh you're fine"
"15818110","15822830"," this way too what i'm trying to make is i'm not going to try and get bearish till the daily"
"15822830","15828330"," trigger is broken that's right tell them again i get bearish why would i get bearish this is a dip"
"15828330","15834450"," buy till then you the daily trigger broken and then the rejection of it right right you broken come"
"15834450","15839230"," back up and then flush down right that that's telling me to get up and that's also around like the"
"15839230","15846790"," 50 50 spx area where's that at right now five oh four forty three yeah so bull's got to hold"
"15846790","15853190"," five oh four right and they can't reject it if they do doom and gloom like get get your your"
"15853190","15858690"," helmets on yeah so till then right you know then if you really think about it it's only like less"
"15858690","15864330"," than a half percent away from where we are right now mm-hmm when i have percent it's nothing it's"
"15864330","15872210"," nothing dude like we're out how many percent it's the error so it's it's just it's not doom and"
"15872210","15877610"," gloom if you're feeling if your port is feeling doom and gloom right now means you're overleveraged"
"15877610","15883150"," they really should we had two banging trades and then today we were looking for a dip buy in the"
"15883150","15890970"," hourly trigger and it didn't hold but um even even saying it didn't hold um even saying that it"
"15890970","15896810"," didn't hold it should be up quite a bit whatever whatever i do uh whatever i check people's trades"
"15896810","15902210"," that what i find always is you know i made a thousand percent i went all in and i made"
"15902210","15912070"," a thousand percent okay what you do and dove one down"
"15912070","15920210"," mark engaling works till it doesn't and right if you have actually blown up your account so well"
"15920210","15926990"," how about this how many how many accounts have you blown up me yeah i have blown up one gamble"
"15926990","15932250"," for you they're whole whole this yeah so i'm saying like not account i don't mean to count like my"

"15961470","15968830"," i've blown up accounts multiple times so so i had put in ten thousand dollars i have gotten it up"
"15968830","15977130"," a fair bit i've taken some money out and then i ended up basically um getting on the wrong side"
"15977130","15984990"," of an er trade that basically took me down from about twenty five thousand positive to down to two"
"15984990","15990250"," thousand dollars because i was over committed i was like this is a short thing but it's a gamble"
"15990250","15994690"," for you right was yeah was it uh all at once like you woke up and it was there and"
"15994690","15999030"," it did were you just staring at it for like two weeks as it happened i started out for two"
"15999030","16005370"," days as it happened so there too and so i'm being honest you're like that's the lesson you learned"
"16005370","16012550"," right heck yeah dude i i basically i didn't let the position that up is zero i just sold it"
"16012550","16019130"," and then i walked away for three days from the market i just walked away and i was like whatever"
"16019130","16024310"," if i made such a big decision that went against me it's going to be in my head i'm going"

"16163030","16168730"," nine o'clock i'm going to be looking for this as a target for tomorrow okay so my my personal"
"16168730","16176250"," where you'll you'll see my market brief you see that you guys see you guys don't see it dia see"

"16188610","16194870"," a pro trader though you already know that uh those market briefs are pretty spot on so uh a very"
"16194870","16203470"," high rate so tomorrow price target uh five twenty actual five twenty on friday i know that it's opx"
"16203470","16208210"," i know that you guys think that they're gonna park the bus here uh i'm looking for five twenty into"
"16208210","16215630"," uh opx on friday right here the only thing that would change my mind on that would be if between"
"16215630","16220250"," now and anytime uh in the middle of the night here if i see any kind of nonsense like this"
"16220250","16226990"," we start heading lower uh that would be cause for concern for me and the really scary part here is"
"16226990","16232850"," that the target to the downside is about five thousand we're so five thousand i'm going to get"
"16232850","16242590"," really bearish here uh into tomorrow so right up in here that's 504 i'm going to assume here that"
"16242590","16249070"," um this is uh i'm doing some high math there without looking at spx but i'm going to assume this"
"16249070","16255290"," is about five thousand down here so a big bloodbath tomorrow uh into opx if we cannot get above"
"16255290","16261310"," five fifteen sixty seven i'll monitor it but my preliminary thoughts here is that we're going to"
"16261310","16265870"," continue higher i'm going to stick with uh i'm going to stick with all this stuff right here demand"
"16265870","16272050"," demand demand push it up into supply demand demand push it up in the supply demand demand demand"
"16272050","16276150"," demand push it up in the supply and we do not have a new low as a matter of fact"

"16339120","16349100"," there and yeah it's both there it's right about there oh man that's going to frustrate so"
"16349100","16358520"," many people tomorrow i think it's still bullish i think so too yep um the the thing is like dixie"
"16358520","16364700"," where i like for the reason i pointed that out i think that is where it has stalled before and"
"16364700","16374200"," yeah around and out today too um this as you said like the morning uh"
"16374200","16380380"," exploration tomorrow is going to like change some things but the only downside like mechanical"
"16380380","16387099"," thing i can think of right now is um the collar we're only two weeks away from the extreme and"
"16387099","16392400"," role of the collar and yeah they blood us down into that collar yeah so they're brought us right"
"16392400","16402919"," down there right like where's the collar uh 50 105 so it's actually"
"16402919","16411320"," higher right there yeah okay yeah so um yeah there you go take a snap of that if you want"
"16411320","16418240"," if you want to take a snap of that at home uh this this i will make a change i'll"
"16418240","16426730"," do it i'll do an update up here right there you might get one more down here one more downside"
"16426730","16433310"," right there possibly something like that sorry it's where like really fat friend is really fast"
"16435779","16440960"," there we'll get back to you really quick oh no you're okay here's the other thing i'm like looking"
"16440960","16446619"," at uh which is um i think we sell down into the collar do you think that we're so far"
"16446619","16453880"," gone that it's not going to turn into a tractor beam i to be honest um i think there's a"
"16453880","16458400"," good opportunity to come back down into the collar and actually let's sink into it before we bounce"
"16458400","16464140"," it there's a good opportunity for that you have to admit that it's not just jpm that does this"
"16464140","16470020"," collar right there's a lot of hangers on yeah there are dude there are people that do the same"
"16470020","16478880"," trade and um the closer we are the stronger to expert the closer we are the closer we get to"
"16478880","16484860"," the closer we are to the strike the stronger than magnet becomes so that's what i'm um mostly"
"16484860","16490980"," concerned about towards the downside because i think i forget which exact number it is sitting at"
"16490980","16495619"," right now um so i have to look like look that up i think hey you want to show it"
"16495619","16501060"," to you yeah sure please that would be if you have it handy okay i got a handy i got"
"16501060","16513500"," you covered oh dude"
"16513500","16520619"," this thing dude check this out i gotta show i gotta show this because i've got sitting on here uh"
"16520619","16530460"," what do i got here so i've got this um i drew this for myself here a few weeks ago"
"16534160","16542400"," nice you like that yes and then this is exact there's the this 5200 and this is uh this is"
"16542400","16548759"," this where we get very um this where we really start getting gnarly down here like that's doom"
"16548759","16557200"," right there isn't it yeah well for a lot of portfolios yes that's going to be doomed especially we"
"16557200","16565700"," just keep riding higher and higher and higher up here yeah there's 53-20 up there right and so like"
"16565700","16574860"," blast up wake up on monday way i'm yeah i'm not that fucking sorry i should be swearing yeah yeah"
"16574860","16579480"," and so so why don't you talk about it i'll i'll be quiet here you start talking about this collar"
"16579480","16586640"," yeah so the the line is the collar right the gold line the gold line 5015 yeah so if that's"
"16586640","16596220"," the collar um 5015 that corresponds to about uh 500 and 500.80"
"16596220","16604919"," on spy so that would be like your downward target which is if we go into which is below the"
"16604919","16609340"," daily trigger which is a break of the daily trigger that's what that is and if we get down below"
"16609340","16617560"," the daily trigger below that particular strike then we're gonna this bringing us down it's bringing"
"16617560","16624540"," us down to the 490s easy so let's start your second way forget below what if we get below uh"
"16624540","16633560"," 504-43 we are close to uh so the 504-43 is about uh of of"
"16633560","16640580"," 5050 on spx if we go down another 35 points because below that and we breach the top the sole"
"16640580","16650540"," cause of the collar we don't have enough time they're gonna sell it"
"16650540","16660480"," because it's just gonna be too much uh short gamma um so go ahead continue so i think then"
"16660480","16669680"," the bottom of that megaphone which you have around 419 or like 4900 spx that comes into play like"
"16669680","16676759"," almost immediately as soon as that collar is broken as soon as we get back under the collar like"
"16676759","16683099"," look last last quarter we pop the collar collar it was a rare event it's very rare it's like one"
"16683099","16687220"," out of nine or ten times it's not it's not that common this one this is what he's talking about"
"16687220","16695160"," right here you pop the collar got above it right it started cranking and we kept cranking right and"
"16695160","16702300"," so again now on this quarter we've popped the collar again but it's been a lot more volatile but we"
"16702300","16707599"," kind of expect that with all-time highs right yeah respect absolutely the highs continue all-time"
"16707599","16715540"," highs come with volatility it's very scary to trade all-time highs for people exactly or because"
"16715540","16722779"," we're all-time highs everybody's looking for a reason to sell right so that's why volatility picks"
"16722779","16728360"," up because swings get wilder the closer you get the all-time highs and continue making all-time"
"16728360","16733580"," highs and then we're not going to continue going up in a straight line right we will have a"
"16733580","16741779"," correction because mark doesn't go up and constantly and oh topping out is a process i don't think"
"16741779","16751099"," we're done popping up yet well so that's a good point and that's a very good point in the reason"
"16751099","16759740"," to your point trader podcast the reason i drew this expanding megaphone or wedge or whatever the"
"16759740","16768279"," reason the whole reason i drew this was because when you get into late stage bull runs right i"
"16768279","16775439"," don't mean late stage in terms of um i don't mean late stage in terms of um uh like this"
"16775439","16783660"," is it but we have about a year left so i'm looking for a more broad base rally uh this"
"16783660","16791850"," is june and this is uh july let's go over to this one right here here's december right here right"
"16791850","16799150"," uh december march all that kind of stuff and you see the straight vertical right here price i doubt"
"16799150","16805250"," we get that i start i think we've start i think we begin to start you know having more you"
"16805250","16813630"," know range but more even higher range as well and then you start to see that six thousand so here"
"16813630","16827630"," let me uh this is a little little upset or a little crazy here but here's uh 596 it's somewhere"
"16827630","16837570"," in here right there so you figure to get there right you know you come for your"
"16837570","16843230"," season of low come up for your summer high come back down come screaming up here right then you get"
"16843230","16848230"," your September low and then you get your last up into end of year just something like that right"
"16848230","16853350"," you see it whoop down just like that up like that up like that and then reach for the sky"
"16853350","16859810"," now this part of that trade could come in march like this last leg where you got to that six"
"16859810","16866090"," thousand it'd be more like subtle you have a little bit more less volatility but a broad base rally"
"16866090","16871270"," right bears are making money bulls are making money and you're heading up to that six thousand i've"
"16871270","16877810"," got i've got about six thousand into either um december or march i think it's march because of the"
"16877810","16883230"," election volatility somewhere in there a little more broad base rally do you see that little bit of"
"16883230","16890790"," expansion uh in price up and down and this looks like that late stage of this bull run for me"
"16890790","16896170"," at least and what's crazy is that's how you begin to see the roll come right unless you have like"
"16896170","16902770"," a covid or a war or something like that um or like uh i don't know a tech bubble or"
"16902770","16911070"," whatever you're going to be looking for a more rounded uh you know high and then down again when"
"16911070","16915710"," you come back down there and start testing that five thousand again this could take some time right"
"16915710","16922850"," so you start seeing that like like that's that's a scroll on a little bit right yeah we could we're"
"16922850","16928990"," talking about two three years from now is down that way right so i mean we'll comment test it i"
"16928990","16933650"," don't think we're going to go test covid lows again i know we're coming back to five thousand i"
"16933650","16938930"," think maybe forty five hundred we're not going to our total of twenty twenty two either we're not"
"16938930","16946370"," going on our support right there right this is support yeah this is there's people in the market"
"16946370","16951950"," there's money in the market that we'll buy in again if we get too low and i completely agree with"
"16951950","16960490"," you man like that's not gonna this doesn't seem like um the wet dream every bear has i don't think"
"16960490","16965230"," that's going to play out yeah i think i think you see i think this is gone down here so"
"16965230","16971770"," that's fifty one fifty again what's that it's seriously just park us at fifty one fifty into close"
"16975090","16980110"," that's one more minute left but look at this even if you come back down here right whoop you're"
"16980110","16986790"," still talking about this you know it's it's like broad base rally boom squeeze up there so you know"
"16986790","16995270"," like yeah i guess if you're a crash guy but you know people have been crash guys forever so i'm"
"16995270","17000010"," not that it's just engagement it's just engagement that you don't have money in the market oh"

"17370870","17371450"," Didn't you, David?"
"17371990","17373330"," Yeah, he was, he was accumulating. "
"17373330","17378550"," I would assume he's like, I'm going to add a little bit here and a little bit more here."
"17378550","17380030"," I'm going to add a little bit more down here."
"17381150","17388990"," David was probably like looking at his levels from like the, from he took the sweep too. "
"17388990","17389910"," He's like, I grabbed the sweep."
"17390250","17390410"," Nice."
"17391070","17391970"," Yeah, nice. "
"17392350","17393650"," I mean, look at this right here, David."
"17394310","17396390"," That was almost a perfect tick, dude."
"17397270","17401610"," Like the early from earlier, I had this, I believe that's almost a perfect fucking tick that I"
"17401610","17402370"," deleted it. "
"17402370","17403230"," I think I deleted it."
"17403830","17406390"," That downside target was almost a perfect fucking tick, man."
"17407450","17412430"," Yeah, this was also the sale today on Spy was more than. "
"17412490","17412990"," Yeah, David."
"17413210","17413490"," Sorry."
"17414450","17415030"," Go on. "
"17415250","17416150"," I started to continue."
"17416530","17421670"," Oh, no, no, no, I was just the sale today on Spy was more than you would expect on a"
"17421670","17425710"," 60-day look back just statistically because that's one of our bearish target pivots."
"17426070","17427310"," So you look at that volume in there. "
"17428730","17430630"," Yeah, look at that volume at the end."
"17430810","17431310"," Oh, yeah."
"17431850","17434490"," And that's not a second to last five minute candle. "
"17434810","17435550"," See, look at that thing."
"17435850","17436690"," Same thing yesterday."
"17437810","17439310"," Yeah, that's CT is buying, man. "
"17439510","17441110"," That's what the five billion NOC."
"17441290","17442670"," You're buying the fuck out of it, dude."
"17443870","17445810"," Yeah, they're like, yeah, we want to loan here. "
"17445890","17447510"," We got everything out of the way."
"17447730","17453010"," We know that tomorrow, though, the thing is we got University of Michigan's sentiment."
"17453430","17455250"," Yeah, yeah, that's the biggest thing tomorrow, right?"
"17455430","17456270"," Michigan sentiment at 10. "
"17456990","17457350"," Yeah."
"17458090","17462070"," Dude, you know, like it's weird because I wasn't reading the chat earlier because it wasn't on the"
"17462070","17462330"," screen."
"17462570","17467650"," But it's weird when you hear like everyone's bared the fuck up. "
"17467770","17469010"," Everyone's bold the fuck up."
"17469090","17470310"," Everybody's bared the fuck up."
"17470410","17471390"," Everybody's bold the fuck up. "
"17471390","17474630"," But I feel bad people because I really it's not everybody."
"17474690","17478410"," But I've realized that some people are getting ripped and destroyed, right?"
"17478650","17479490"," We're already at the bottom."
"17480510","17485170"," Dude, the real shaders are not putting their trades on Twitter for free for everybody. "
"17485570","17486630"," No, dude."
"17486870","17493450"," Even the market, the market briefs that we do, I want to start posting some of it, but I don't"
"17493450","17498070"," want to put it out there on public so much."
"17498110","17499110"," I've been asked to do that. "
"17499290","17503590"," I don't know if I want to do the whole thing or someone recommended that I do it late, not"
"17503590","17503770"," early."
"17505890","17507110"," I don't want to get shit on."
"17507410","17508230"," If it goes big, it's weird. "
"17508470","17510430"," Like, let's see, let's see you do like five or 10."
"17510630","17513410"," Let's see you do seven great briefs and you have three bad ones."
"17514050","17516230"," Someone's going to be like, well, you got one wrong over there. "
"17516330","17517030"," That guy's an idiot."
"17517030","17519250"," I don't know."
"17519330","17521830"," I don't want to get devolved into that, I guess. "
"17522430","17526910"," And that is the problem of running a service, right?"
"17527130","17531310"," Like people will be like, you got to show me because like 100% gains all the time and you"
"17531310","17534630"," got to show me bangers, like every single day, right?"
"17534690","17535710"," David's saying the same thing."
"17535710","17537490"," He's like, I just post in the Discord."
"17537750","17540770"," And the reason you do that, too, is because everybody's got skin in the game, right?"
"17541330","17542310"," People care if you lose. "
"17542570","17543910"," People, you know, they care about you."
"17543990","17544650"," They want to see you win."
"17544650","17547310"," Like, but I'm like Twitter, man. "
"17547450","17548770"," Twitter's a fucking hellhole."
"17551160","17551640"," Yeah."
"17551940","17552620"," No, I don't. "
"17552720","17555760"," I, I, if you've noticed, I, I never call a trade."
"17556160","17557140"," Five, 20, David."
"17557280","17559580"," I'm holding those bad boys to the, to the bitter end tomorrow. "
"17559880","17561880"," I'd sell those bad boys."
"17562120","17562840"," Stay on, bro."
"17563420","17563660"," Yeah. "
"17563860","17565020"," I got 25 of those two."
"17565160","17566360"," I close with five cents apiece."
"17567220","17567600"," So. "
"17568340","17569860"," So let's ride, I guess."
"17572840","17574920"," I'll put 125 votes on it."
"17578160","17578560"," Yeah. "
"17578800","17580460"," It's not, I mean, it's a sweet pump."
"17580740","17585620"," Like even if we open up for five, 14, we just gotta go to another 50, another 40, another 50"
"17585620","17586560"," points and we're good to go."
"17586560","17586940"," So. "
"17587520","17587800"," Yeah."
"17588740","17589780"," That's less than a percent."
"17590160","17591100"," Less than a percent, man. "
"17591640","17592140"," Yeah, David."
"17592300","17593580"," I took a bunch of five center."
"17593580","17594940"," I got them for six cents, man. "
"17595500","17598100"," I got them for six cents and started, started racking them up."
"17601740","17602320"," Six cents, dude."
"17602380","17603620"," I got five points for six cents. "
"17605140","17606320"," That is pretty fun."
"17606520","17607580"," David's got him at five cents."
"17608520","17608940"," Yeah. "
"17610000","17610700"," I don't know."
"17610940","17611680"," So let's see."
"17614860","17615280"," Nvidia. "
"17616560","17617920"," Did not have a good day."
"17618500","17619380"," It's kind of sad."
"17620880","17621300"," But. "
"17622340","17624260"," Feel comfortable if you want to swing it."
"17625660","17626820"," Into next week."
"17627580","17628260"," Say again. "
"17629240","17631480"," Nvidia did not have a good day, but I still feel."
"17631680","17632280"," I mean, I have."
"17632460","17633540"," Yeah, I think it looks great, man. "
"17633920","17634160"," Yeah."
"17634520","17635600"," I'm the inverse of this shit."
"17635720","17636460"," I love pullbacks. "
"17637200","17637600"," Yeah."
"17638500","17639440"," It's come down."
"17640780","17643040"," To, you know, it closed about eight 75. "
"17643580","17645320"," And that's what I was kind of really hoping for."
"17645380","17646720"," It's a nice psychological level."
"17647320","17649800"," And, you know, this is where we traded like three days ago. "
"17649800","17651940"," So it's not even a big deal."
"17652680","17655860"," The already velocity was pretty low end of the day."
"17655960","17656640"," I like that, dude. "
"17656760","17657500"," That looks good, too."
"17658100","17659660"," How's the daily fellow looking on it?"
"17659920","17661860"," Is it really maxed out or is it starting to roll yet?"
"17662900","17663940"," Yeah, that's not."
"17663940","17666360"," Well, the weekly, the weekly is in your favor. "
"17666760","17668460"," The daily is a little sketchy."
"17668880","17669280"," Yeah."
"17669520","17671400"," And the thing is, there's a little bit of. "
"17671600","17672280"," That's pretty bad."
"17672320","17673840"," The daily coming down like that."
"17673900","17674460"," It's pretty bad. "
"17675180","17676980"," It doesn't mean it won't come back up."
"17677120","17679400"," See that weekly velocity is still holding you up."
"17679400","17684320"," So I think you might get one more pump on the daily until you max out in the weekly. "
"17685020","17686220"," Looking at them together, right?"
"17687320","17689320"," So you might get like one more pump."
"17689980","17691080"," That's kind of what I want."
"17691260","17694260"," So I can sell sell some year long out. "
"17694980","17695820"," Call is the night."
"17696200","17699140"," When's the 19th or is that next Thursday or no?"
"17699960","17700540"," It's next."
"17700960","17704740"," Next Monday is the 18th and 19th is Tuesday. "
"17705100","17705440"," Oh shit."
"17705580","17705940"," That's soon."
"17706620","17706940"," Yeah. "
"17707460","17712400"," I'd be interested in buying Nvidia for that conference like Monday or Tuesday."
"17712940","17713380"," Yeah."
"17713540","17714560"," See, that's what I'm kind of hoping. "
"17715620","17716920"," So this is the daily, right?"
"17716920","17718580"," Yeah, that's where it is."
"17718660","17719240"," Do you see it?"
"17719680","17721780"," Like that bloodshot down and then straight up."
"17722160","17722580"," Yeah. "
"17722920","17727740"," So I, I, I'm okay with Nvidia being where it is a close above 875."
"17728040","17728620"," That's what I wanted."
"17729300","17736400"," And if I had started to break down a lot below 875, excuse my charts because they're not as pretty"
"17736400","17737500"," as everybody else. "
"17737680","17738260"," You got nice charts."
"17738480","17739140"," I like your charts."
"17740660","17745800"," But yeah, I'm just kind of looking for, I forget, we drew this together and I think it was like"
"17745800","17747020"," kind of hourly or something. "
"17747360","17748360"," Yeah, I was at a different timeframe."
"17749060","17749380"," Yeah."
"17749900","17750880"," I think this is where it was. "
"17750940","17751500"," Yeah, that's way better."
"17752360","17753460"," Sexy charts, bro."
"17755400","17757080"," I return the pivots off. "
"17757820","17763420"," And so yeah, we're kind of, you know, looking to bounce a little bit."
"17764200","17766700"," We'll fill that up and maybe 80% is the rule, right?"
"17766700","17769660"," So sometime on Tuesday, we get a breakup."
"17770140","17771360"," Hopefully that's what we get. "
"17771640","17776180"," It'd be nice to see a Monday dip on NVDA and then a turnaround blast north, right?"
"17776880","17777180"," Yeah."
"17777800","17777820"," Yeah."
"17778060","17778680"," I mean, I'm in shares. "
"17779060","17779660"," I'm not."
"17779820","17780300"," I don't have any."
"17780680","17784580"," I do not have any. "
"17786260","17787140"," Options on it right now."
"17787660","17791580"," When do you think outside of seasonal weakness or correction?"
"17791960","17794280"," When do you think the run for NVDA is over?"
"17800170","17804070"," Do you think it's like, because I look at Tesla and when they started running, it didn't stop."
"17805170","17806730"," Yeah, that's where I am. "
"17807210","17811470"," I'm a big, I mean, I've never been a Tesla fanboy, but I'm a big entity fanboy."
"17812330","17816990"," And I honestly think to this, it's nowhere close to top and now."
"17817370","17823170"," So I think about is when Tesla was that stock or Apple was that stock, I always think about people"
"17823170","17827270"," saying $1000 done and I'm like, yeah, I don't think so. "
"17827270","17833170"," Plus you get the stock split talk and SMCI stock split stock or talk."
"17833450","17837810"," And then I'm thinking to myself, I'm like, dude, once Tesla started running, Apple started running."
"17837930","17839070"," It just didn't fucking stop. "
"17839270","17839290"," Right?"
"17839450","17841250"," Just kept going and going and going."
"17841530","17844510"," It's growth story and was for a long time."
"17844830","17845810"," It's a little bit shorter, but. "
"17846610","17851530"," So it's about all it used to be about what share of the pie you're going to get in the"
"17851530","17855310"," video and with generative AI and AI in general."
"17855310","17857950"," I know there's people and like, it's not a, yeah, they're not."
"17858130","17862990"," But at this point, you know, you can call it AI, you know, anything that's sufficiently advanced. "
"17864350","17867310"," You can just, like in part, a car in parlance call it AI."
"17867790","17869830"," Those technologies are here to stay."
"17870410","17876190"," And they're going to be, they've opened up this whole new pie that they have the biggest share out"
"17876190","17876350"," of. "
"17876750","17878770"," And that pie is only going to get bigger."
"17880430","17882650"," We might have other issues down the line."
"17883470","17886210"," As to, you know, what's going to happen with workers. "
"17886210","17888870"," We're going to have, you know, good old American."
"17891070","17895010"," Shumpeterian creative destruction is what we're going to get in the sector."
"17895390","17898670"," And I think in videos, the company for that. "
"17898990","17901210"," I, I really do believe that."
"17901210","17904310"," And that's why I'm not terribly worried about."
"17906230","17910590"," I'm not terribly, terribly worried about if it's going to dump any time soon. "
"17910590","17914170"," And you know, what's going to be the Canadian, the coal mines for me to like start thinking about"
"17914170","17919570"," getting up is after they announced a stock split."
"17920130","17920570"," Yes."
"17921130","17927050"," Or I think when they announce that you're going to get another rip until that stock split takes"
"17927050","17927550"," effect. "
"17928170","17928610"," Exactly."
"17929050","17931670"," And that's when I would be looking to get up, getting up."
"17932170","17933770"," And the thing is, I remember this. "
"17934010","17935790"," I have looked at it in videos charts so much."
"17935790","17940610"," And videos had two 80% drawdowns in its history."
"17941450","17945150"," 80% drawdown 1000 is $100. "
"17945810","17948410"," What's a share of, what's a share of Apple class right now?"
"17948730","17949390"," An original one."
"17951130","17953370"," $26,000, I think it could be wrong."
"17953590","17953610"," Yeah. "
"17954270","17955490"," Yeah, something like that."
"17955730","17956590"," I think it's roughly in there."
"17957990","17961690"," So how many splits have they had now two or one and VDA?"
"17962350","17964270"," Oh, they've had a lot. "
"17964270","17965230"," Let's go mad."
"17965270","17965650"," Are they really?"
"17965790","17966810"," I thought only I had a couple of them."
"17967250","17969250"," No, no, they've had like three or four of them. "
"17969370","17970270"," I did not know that."
"17970710","17971030"," Yeah."
"17971130","17974970"," So Nvidia, Nvidia, you know, since March nine. "
"17975390","17976510"," Let me look it up and see what it is."
"17977070","17982790"," It is like, if you bought it at IPO, the cover, it will be 45 cents."
"17983170","17983670"," I remember that. "
"17983790","17984230"," That was crazy."
"17986030","17987030"," I mean, after all."
"17987150","17987690"," I did look at that. "
"17987850","17988790"," How many stocks foots?"
"17992160","17992800"," Maybe I am wrong."
"17992940","17994520"," I want to know what it's worth right now at that."
"18001210","18002530"," Oh, they've had five. "
"18003270","18004250"," That's a lot, actually."
"18004890","18005490"," Yeah."
"18006250","18007730"," And it keeps going up. "
"18009010","18010190"," That's actually a lot."
"18010610","18011210"," Yeah."
"18011810","18013610"," So, you know, Cap?"
"18014710","18021050"," If we have a drawdown, right, on Nvidia, whenever that happens, we're going to come back for that"
"18021050","18021730"," quarterly trigger. "
"18022450","18023490"," Yes, they are."
"18025750","18028890"," So, that's where you, that's where you aim for."
"18029510","18032310"," I love your broker and be like, Hey, man. "
"18033290","18036250"," I'm going to take a hundred percent margin against everything."
"18036810","18038490"," I want to put it in Nvidia shorts."
"18040190","18042530"," When that starts happening or conversing. "
"18042710","18044010"," I actually don't do that."
"18044150","18046730"," I don't like shorting things because I'm not smart enough to be a bear."
"18047030","18047390"," Me neither. "
"18047610","18048290"," I'm stupid dude."
"18048410","18049050"," In my life."
"18049050","18056110"," So, yeah, I will just wait until where the quarterly trigger is and just be like, and then call up"
"18056110","18056290"," by. "
"18057070","18062490"," Broker and be like, okay, I'm going full margin and I'm buying an MDDL at this point."
"18063010","18065190"," And just will write the leverage of the shares of it."
"18065510","18070910"," So anyways, I think this, this one has a lot more room to go. "
"18073130","18076370"," I think it's especially like things like this."
"18076550","18078590"," You can't put an upside target because it's all conjecture."
"18079270","18083530"," But the big psychological thing is a thousand and after a thousand is 1500. "
"18084210","18087570"," Okay, so if they sell a thousand, what's the pullback to?"
"18088470","18091590"," If they sell a thousand, then you're looking for a quarterly."
"18092330","18093050"," Like anything."
"18093570","18097650"," I think they trade like 1250 and then pull back to a thousand to hold it. "
"18100170","18101730"," To hold it."
"18102190","18102590"," Yeah."
"18102750","18105690"," Well, the reason I'm asking like, wait, I'm not setting up or anything. "
"18105870","18109350"," But one of the tickers that I really appreciate is Amazon."
"18110330","18110730"," Yeah."
"18111390","18116650"," So they would like make a leg up and then have a consolidation phase, then a leg up, then a"
"18116650","18118690"," consolidation phase, then a leg up. "
"18120410","18124410"," I'm wondering if that like, if you're going to go to a thousand, why would be why?"
"18125070","18127170"," I always like my head, I'm scratching my head going."
"18127170","18132610"," If we're going to drive up to a thousand bucks, you would go above it and then consolidated a"
"18132610","18135050"," thousand to trade 500 or something."
"18135270","18135350"," Right. "
"18135830","18138690"," Or you consolidating an 800 to trade 1500."
"18138690","18139530"," I don't know."
"18140330","18149110"," I would honestly like, if they go to, let's say 1250 and they bring it back to a thousand and"
"18149110","18154250"," they hold a thousand, then I would be like, okay, dude, that's a 20% correction right there. "
"18154550","18154810"," Yeah."
"18154810","18157070"," And this is a chance for me to go long again."
"18158410","18160330"," I mean, they're doing it with spoos right now, right?"
"18160890","18161170"," Yeah. "
"18161410","18165970"," I mean, that's why I'm like, when we like looked at it, you know, on, on SPX."
"18166210","18169890"," I was like, on spy, I was like, dude, like five or five."
"18170170","18172310"," That's, that's healthy, which is going to five or five. "
"18172470","18173070"," That's the daily trigger."
"18173430","18174470"," Like I'll be doing it."
"18174490","18176370"," It's a percent down from where we were on that point. "
"18176870","18178930"," I do think we spend a lot of time around here."
"18178930","18185470"," I think like this 5,000, we're going to be here for a lot, not a while, but there's going"
"18185470","18190450"," to be a month or two or three hanging around here and then making sure that that's where we're"
"18190450","18190710"," going."
"18190870","18193210"," But once we know that we're on 5000, we're going to run. "
"18193650","18194050"," Right."
"18194410","18200270"," You know what, this reminds me, I need to like run my scripts for the digest that people are here"
"18200270","18200670"," listening."
"18200670","18210250"," I do, I do post the daily digest that I generate with like overlays and,"
"18210410","18211670"," you know, week. "
"18212390","18215350"," Today is highs, lows and everything in the trade, the trigger discord."
"18217150","18219330"," I will, I've been putting them in the general chat."
"18219550","18225810"," I will be starting to put them starting next week in the, in the pro traders chat. "
"18227650","18230270"," So, you know, I'll occasionally put one or two plots."
"18230810","18232270"," Did you get a channel yet or no?"
"18232950","18233910"," No, I don't have a channel yet."
"18234150","18234570"," That's okay. "
"18234830","18236530"," We just got to put it in the pro traders chat."
"18236850","18236910"," Okay."
"18237450","18242450"," I was going to get your own channel and get you a pro, like a channel for pro traders and"
"18242450","18243550"," I was going to get you a webpage too. "
"18243770","18245410"," I just haven't gotten to it from slam."
"18245570","18246170"," You've been busy."
"18246390","18246730"," I get it. "
"18246910","18247310"," I get it."
"18247490","18248030"," So anyways."
"18251650","18255190"," I, I, the overlay that I generated this morning. "
"18256550","18260990"," Let me see if I can pull that up on my screen."
"18261530","18262670"," Just bear with me a second."
"18263130","18263610"," I'm watching. "
"18268900","18270080"," I need a bear, man."
"18270240","18270600"," You want a bear?"
"18271740","18272740"," I drink beer."
"18273000","18273440"," Do stuff. "
"18273660","18274300"," Yeah, I love beer."
"18274420","18276120"," I actually, I think sports more, but."
"18277560","18279560"," I need a bear. "
"18279660","18280960"," I haven't had a fucking bear, dude."
"18282560","18284240"," I would say a third."
"18284400","18284740"," I need a bear. "
"18284920","18285660"," It's a bear Thursday."
"18286000","18286540"," Give me two seconds."
"18286880","18287120"," Keep stuck. "
"18287260","18287940"," Talk to these guys."
"18288100","18288500"," I'll be right back."
"18289060","18289520"," I got it. "
"18290080","18290960"," You got scotch."
"18291040","18291660"," Grab a scotch."
"18291980","18294660"," No, I got things going on at like five o'clock. "
"18294920","18295520"," Oh, you do."
"18295640","18295800"," Yeah."
"18296420","18296420"," Yeah. "
"18296680","18299840"," So I can't really have any alcohol right now, but."
"18306820","18307780"," All right."
"18307920","18308740"," Can you guys see my screen?"
"18314620","18315860"," So this is the. "
"18316900","18319180"," Overlayer that I had generated earlier in the day."
"18320680","18323540"," New overlayer, I will generate that a little later."
"18323680","18327280"," I'm collecting all the data right now for like all the other plots that I generate. "
"18328380","18329340"," I'm back."
"18330580","18333200"," So yeah, without what I have is the overlayer on the screen."
"18333200","18335780"," Oh, nice. "
"18337240","18338680"," And this is from earlier in the day."
"18339180","18339720"," It's not updated."
"18340180","18341080"," We updated one. "
"18341460","18343960"," I'm getting all the data for all the other plots."
"18344080","18348480"," It'll generate this after all the data is trying to fix what 2025 asks for all that should happen."
"18350220","18355440"," But what I want to like point out is that the red line is trending down the blue line, which"
"18355440","18356420"," was like my squeeze line. "
"18356760","18363180"," It didn't happen and it's trending down, but it picks back up."
"18364420","18370540"," And, you know, the only thing that's kind of like keeps going up is this pink line, which is 1954."
"18371620","18377660"," It is the weakest correlation as of this moment and this 1995 line, which is kind of like, oh,"
"18377760","18379740"," we're just going to like have dips and keep going. "
"18379940","18381040"," I like that pink line, man."
"18381160","18382020"," That's what I'm looking at."
"18382380","18386080"," Like that looks like that explosive that pink line looks like. "
"18386380","18387460"," Is it what years that?"
"18388040","18388480"," 1954."
"18389280","18390740"," I love that time period."
"18391220","18391700"," Yeah. "
"18392040","18392880"," So though, here's the thing."
"18393060","18394260"," That's why I like to generate this."
"18394540","18396480"," It adjusts automatically. "
"18397500","18400280"," Do you have 1995 to 1999?"
"18401080","18402240"," I do have 1995."
"18402320","18403340"," It's the green line."
"18403840","18405840"," Oh, yeah, right there. "
"18406260","18406860"," Right there."
"18407140","18407240"," Right."
"18407460","18408080"," It's kind of like. "
"18408420","18413240"," I think we're in like 98, 99 right now or 97, 99, but from 94."
"18413760","18414460"," I think we're in a compressed."
"18414880","18416140"," I would love to see. "
"18417220","18417700"," 95."
"18419180","18419720"," Yes."
"18421100","18422180"," 99 compressed. "
"18423420","18426620"," On this chart, but ended in March and see what it looks like."
"18427140","18427920"," Oh, interesting."
"18428500","18429940"," I'll have to like work on that. "
"18430160","18434460"," But what this chart is telling us that we are in the starting phases of the."
"18434780","18436320"," Com bubble that we are."
"18436880","18441720"," From the, because this, this line, it starts on January 19, 1995. "
"18443480","18444540"," And our current data."
"18445380","18449300"," Windows starts from October 19, 2023."
"18449780","18453500"," So the only thing that I would say to you would be check out the PE ratio and S&P"
"18453500","18453860"," 500. "
"18454000","18455360"," We've broken above the."
"18456920","18458440"," PE ratio of."
"18459320","18459520"," 87. "
"18460040","18463760"," And we're now tracking the new PE or the next highest PE ratio."
"18464200","18466700"," Of 1995 to 1999."
"18467420","18471420"," Yeah, but we're halfway through it in PE ratio at this point. "
"18471420","18472760"," That's my only fair here."
"18473040","18473560"," Yeah."
"18473560","18474980"," But see, here's the other thing too. "
"18475040","18477780"," Remember, we've pumped $6 trillion into the economy."
"18478500","18481360"," Dude, we got to talk about that, dude."
"18481660","18482540"," So think about that. "
"18482700","18484420"," The PE ratios can get inflated."
"18485260","18489460"," Yeah, this is where we're, we're in the next stage of inflation right now."
"18489720","18490160"," Yeah. "
"18490360","18493640"," What I'm saying is PE ratios can get inflated past the.com bubble."
"18494500","18495380"," That bar."
"18495900","18496480"," Because I go ahead. "
"18497720","18498280"," No, go ahead."
"18498960","18502240"," No, at that time we have interest rates about the same as they were right now."
"18502760","18505000"," Dude, do you remember, dude, do you remember when. "
"18506460","18508140"," People are on fint to it and they were like."
"18509080","18512020"," Hey, look, you need to have a PE ratio of like 10 or 12."
"18512300","18513380"," I was like, I want to have been to it. "
"18513460","18514820"," I'm like, we are fucking at 12."
"18515180","18517900"," We're at the fucking slope that everybody's buying since 1978."
"18518460","18518840"," Yeah. "
"18518960","18519980"," You want like."
"18520520","18521920"," Sorry, I'm swearing on the stream, but."
"18523920","18524900"," I saw that chart. "
"18524920","18528600"," You posted it a little while back, which is like the PE ratios and the different windows."
"18528600","18529920"," And I posted it in October."
"18530660","18531040"," Yeah. "
"18532240","18534580"," I was in like, I'm like, we are here right now."
"18535580","18538220"," We're literally at the bounce line right now."
"18538340","18540220"," And I'm like, I'm not McGillic. "
"18540260","18540780"," What's the name?"
"18542780","18543420"," What's his name?"
"18543520","18545140"," Yeah, Miguel."
"18545380","18547040"," It's like it needs to come down."
"18547140","18550260"," And I'm like, dude, you've been buying that shit since since you were fucking 25. "
"18550260","18551320"," What are you talking about?"
"18551880","18552100"," Yeah."
"18552460","18553180"," Now you're an old man."
"18553400","18554600"," You don't want you don't need it anymore. "
"18555220","18556140"," It's kind of funny."
"18556440","18559200"," The boys are like super smart."
"18559200","18564360"," I think it was just, I think it was just begging for his bonds to print, to be honest with"
"18564360","18564520"," you. "
"18564820","18565940"," Yeah, that's true."
"18566320","18568720"," They did have a bond position."
"18569100","18572340"," But anyways, this brown line is 2010s, by the way. "
"18574820","18575140"," I do."
"18576320","18576500"," I got it."
"18576580","18579080"," We got to talk to Volway is because he was talking up. "
"18579340","18580860"," He was tracking this week."
"18581700","18583040"," That QE has already started."
"18584040","18587160"," They're already, they're already pouring money into the system and just not telling anybody. "
"18587980","18589940"," Yeah, which is possible because."
"18590680","18595740"," And then you can deposit that Jerome is not going to get hawkish at this meeting."
"18596580","18602160"," He said, I, he came back and said, this is every time he's gotten hawkish and it's so rare to"
"18602160","18603300"," find a hawkish Jerome. "
"18604260","18606340"," Yeah, he gets hawkish, but it's so rare."
"18608060","18609960"," He was late last time too."
"18610100","18610180"," Right. "
"18610280","18613480"," He let the market run hot into 2021."
"18614220","18614700"," Yeah."
"18614900","18615940"," Big slap them. "
"18616320","18616520"," Yeah."
"18618940","18621680"," Even gave a warning, nice warning before we got there."
"18622020","18622440"," Yeah. "
"18623280","18623980"," That's the thing."
"18624200","18631120"," And this is why there's bears out there that I've read on Twitter and in my subreddit where they're"
"18631120","18634040"," like, you know, Jerome's going to have a hike."
"18634320","18635620"," And I was like, are you kidding me?"
"18635760","18637520"," He's not going to come on and talk about. "
"18637680","18641880"," At FOMC, they would float that idea."
"18641880","18646740"," They will call Nicky Leaks or something and kind of be like, hey, they would push the narrative"
"18646740","18649680"," that maybe the federal become adversarial again."
"18649860","18650020"," Right. "
"18650340","18655940"," No, they're like, I'm saying that you would hear that from like Washington Post first before."
"18656560","18656980"," Exactly."
"18657600","18658020"," Exactly. "
"18658440","18660680"," You would get it from Nick Timorels."
"18660980","18664120"," Yeah, Nick would come out and say, you know, like, the Fed looks like it's going to become more"
"18664120","18664760"," adversarial."
"18665060","18667000"," You know, that's the Fed speaking, right?"
"18667000","18670980"," Fucking Mark would drop 100 points that day just on that fucking article, wouldn't it?"
"18671620","18672120"," Yeah. "
"18672260","18676500"," And he usually posts them at eight between eight 30 and 45 in the morning."
"18677340","18681380"," You'd be like sitting there with your retail bags, you know, and your options."
"18681640","18682420"," You're like, Oh, shit. "
"18683740","18683760"," Right."
"18685320","18687100"," Nick stands up for a question."
"18687780","18689680"," Jerome gives a little smile at him. "
"18690040","18690540"," Yeah."
"18691340","18693340"," You know, saying, thank you for the layup."
"18694280","18695100"," That's the thing. "
"18695380","18697620"," It's, it's like, I don't get it, man."
"18697840","18699300"," Like, it really irritates me."
"18699920","18703700"," Do more bears really irritate me, especially when they take things out of context. "
"18703860","18707500"," And they keep talking about all these old models of economics."
"18708240","18709080"," That's true too."
"18709340","18709440"," Right. "
"18710040","18711320"," I'm with you on that for sure."
"18712020","18712420"," Any more."
"18713100","18714040"," And they don't work, man. "
"18714600","18714980"," Yeah."
"18715320","18721540"," And the thing is, as much as modern monetary theory has been maligned in the last couple of years,"
"18721540","18722440"," it's probably the next."
"18723860","18726020"," It's a cult of economics too, right?"
"18726200","18727460"," But they all prescribed to it. "
"18727580","18730200"," All those people graduated together real books together, didn't they?"
"18730440","18730920"," Yeah."
"18731140","18735480"," They're all from the Austrian school of economics, you know, like, which is, you know, the."
"18736880","18737840"," Or Keynesian. "
"18738060","18744840"," And, you know, it's the ultimate problem with all those things is that they say that taxes."
"18745540","18751540"," Pay for the government and modern monetary theory says that taxes are just a way to suck up"
"18751540","18753220"," liquidity from the system."
"18753740","18758980"," In a country like the US or the UK, which had sovereign global reserve currencies. "
"18759740","18763980"," They can print as much as they want, as long as the economy can absorb it."
"18764280","18766640"," The issue is we gave money."
"18767120","18768260"," They gave too much money. "
"18768720","18771980"," And that went into the wrong sectors where there was not enough capacity."
"18772560","18776720"," We cannot build homes as fast as people wanted to buy them during COVID."
"18777220","18781600"," Dude, we, we, we had a deficit going into a way that we added to the deficits. "
"18782920","18786160"," We had a deficit going into a way that we created even more deficit."
"18786860","18787700"," And then we rallied."
"18788760","18789680"," And then we rallied. "
"18790060","18793980"," And that's what I'm trying to say deficits don't matter for America or for the UK."
"18794780","18799040"," They don't because as long as we have enough turnover of money."
"18799040","18804840"," You know, you mustn't heard this said that that the American consumer is the one that makes the"
"18804840","18805660"," world economy go. "
"18806260","18806420"," Right."
"18806560","18807220"," It is so true."
"18807220","18811620"," Because what that is talking about is a turnover of money in the hands of the people who are in"
"18811620","18812060"," the economy. "
"18812460","18817880"," And as long as that keeps going in our economy, the deficit does not matter how much money we print"
"18817880","18818880"," does not matter."
"18819120","18820360"," That's my honest opinion."
"18820960","18826220"," And that's coming from, you know, reading a lot of economics papers and actually reading these"
"18826220","18830940"," books on modern monetary theory and these papers on modern monetary theory and like looking at the"
"18830940","18832860"," kind of metrics behind how they're testing all of the stuff. "
"18833740","18838320"," This is just like this is what I feel and it's gotten aligned."
"18838980","18843940"," And we don't save as a culture doing your culture that you come from saves, right?"
"18845380","18851040"," Well, yeah, you keep familiar wealth, don't you know, or your father's father."
"18852140","18853360"," Mother's father's father's father. "
"18854360","18855020"," What's your."
"18856680","18857360"," What's your."
"18857640","18858560"," Talk about that. "
"18858680","18858960"," Okay."
"18859360","18860720"," We can have the conversation."
"18861060","18861720"," Oh, that's fine. "
"18861900","18862420"," Yeah."
"18862960","18864180"," Well, Americans don't do that."
"18864220","18864700"," It's my point. "
"18864900","18870440"," American like American culture is that my kids don't take care of me."
"18871080","18873280"," You know, as a standard, right."
"18873280","18875320"," Or not our son should set. "
"18875860","18877320"," Like an American college side."
"18877560","18880140"," So my wife is from Japan, right?"
"18880760","18881100"," Right."
"18882020","18884000"," And your children take care of you in Japan. "
"18884760","18885100"," Right."
"18886000","18888540"," And it's a reverse here in the United States, right?"
"18889140","18889460"," Yeah."
"18889720","18892740"," Well, then we also in Japan, they don't keep their kid out after 18. "
"18893200","18894020"," No, they don't."
"18894560","18894900"," Right."
"18895000","18895520"," They don't at all. "
"18895620","18896780"," It cuts both ways."
"18898340","18899600"," So anyways, my."
"18900580","18902360"," So my thoughts around. "
"18903020","18905520"," Around modern monetary theory are primarily."
"18906480","18906980"," That."
"18907560","18909540"," The reason it appears to have failed. "
"18909920","18915220"," During COVID is actually that the money ended up going into sectors that could not absorb all that"
"18915220","18915500"," money."
"18916040","18918780"," Like if I, if I had gone into like the food industry, right?"
"18919220","18919900"," It would have been fine."
"18920420","18921640"," But it went into like. "
"18923040","18927700"," What people considered as good investments, which is like owning a home and we have zero interest"
"18927700","18928000"," rates."
"18928000","18933780"," So, you know, people got cheap homes and we couldn't build them fast enough and, you know, prices"
"18933780","18934920"," just kept going up and."
"18935360","18938860"," Everybody kept buying them because they had the cash or they had, they thought they had the"
"18938860","18939120"," ability. "
"18940340","18944880"," So the other thing that happened is not those people that are sitting in 30 and mortgages 30 year"
"18944880","18947780"," mortgages at like 3% to 3%."
"18947780","18949780"," They're like, we're not going to get rid of this house."
"18950540","18952040"," We're not getting rid of this mortgage. "
"18952040","18957960"," So we're not going to have a global financial crisis type crash because that's where all that money"
"18957960","18958560"," is tied up."
"18959260","18961380"," You know, that came in in COVID."
"18961900","18966480"," So what I'm trying to say is that what you're seeing is that the money that came in went into"
"18966480","18968960"," an industry which could not absorb it. "
"18968960","18973680"," So we got inflation on that side, but the conditions was such that we're not going to get a crash"
"18973680","18974280"," on that side."
"18974960","18977060"," Commercial real estate, different animal."
"18978860","18984980"," And we can talk about that, but they're at least their loans are shorter dated. "
"18985280","18989180"," So the other people have to refinance and that's where the issue comes over there."
"18990800","18991440"," But yeah."
"18992120","18994300"," So look, I'm going to show this really quick if I can. "
"18995160","18996360"," Take me off the screen."
"18996580","18997380"," I'm kind of done."
"18997660","18998780"," I just have stuff up. "
"18999500","19002140"," So this is a paper that I read just recently."
"19002140","19011120"," This is the V O X E U C E PR, the intergenerational transmission of wealth in rich countries."
"19011440","19012520"," And I want to show you guys something here. "
"19012600","19015900"," So this is here's Britain, right?"
"19016360","19020580"," And you can see a share of total transfer amounts going to each age group."
"19020980","19022220"," You've got Britain here."
"19022220","19025000"," You've got France with pre decent generational wealth. "
"19025020","19027140"," But look at the U S, how low it is."
"19027140","19032720"," U S is one of the lowest places for transfer of generational wealth across all of Europe."
"19033880","19036460"," We are like the U S is like built. "
"19036840","19038640"," Our whole system is built here."
"19039880","19046320"," For you to, you know, have your shot at making money, but then transferring that wealth to younger"
"19046320","19047200"," generations."
"19047900","19053120"," So that like that, like a rotation of cash in your country, right?"
"19053120","19057900"," Makes money continue to move around, even though we complain about it in the United States. "
"19058140","19061440"," So if you want to see this, if you want to see this, this article that I read, it's called"
"19061440","19068600"," C E P R dot org V O X E or port slash V O X E U."
"19068840","19071280"," Are you still there?"
"19071420","19072080"," Did I lose you?"
"19072360","19073180"," No, I'm here."
"19073460","19077080"," If you can like, if you can, let me transfer over to the paint."
"19077900","19080420"," Yeah, so like everybody can know, I can see it. "
"19080460","19081300"," If you can just put it on."
"19081320","19081500"," Oh, yeah."
"19081600","19082320"," Can you see that now?"
"19082840","19084360"," Yeah, that could see it. "
"19084380","19085180"," Now I can see you."
"19085460","19085780"," Sorry."
"19087160","19088400"," This is the paper. "
"19088480","19089480"," Yeah, I'll read that paper."
"19089940","19092600"," Yeah, the generational transmission of wealth in rich countries."
"19093140","19095460"," And like does wealth get transferred?"
"19095700","19096720"," Does it not get transferred?"
"19097360","19099640"," And then how that impacts money flow, right?"
"19100200","19101640"," And the U S has great money flow. "
"19102140","19106460"," Our whole system here is built like, it's a horrible system because they disagree with it."
"19108920","19116660"," I'm getting older and, you know, like if I get sick or something and I lose my insurance, then I'm"
"19116660","19117700"," going to be in trouble, right?"
"19117980","19120300"," I need savings for myself."
"19120580","19122160"," I stopped working any of that kind of stuff. "
"19123680","19124700"," But take a look at this."
"19124880","19130980"," In a generational transmission of wealth in rich countries, it's fascinating to see how money flows"
"19130980","19131880"," within a country."
"19132820","19134480"," All right, that's, I think that's all I got. "
"19134680","19136140"," Do you want to talk about anything else today or no?"
"19136840","19139700"," No, I think that is it."
"19139880","19141920"," Let's hope for a nice, big rip tomorrow."
"19142320","19142860"," What do you think?"
"19143020","19144000"," What's your call for tomorrow?"
"19144160","19145460"," We going up or going down our sideways?"
"19146780","19147900"," It's all fixed, man. "
"19148240","19150780"," Honestly, if anything, I don't care if you're wrong."
"19151080","19153140"," I'll never judge it."
"19154400","19161480"," That's where my bias lies as of right now, especially after $5 billion by MOC order, you know. "
"19161960","19165600"," Do you want to tell people what that trade is real quick?"
"19166520","19169180"," I know if, but not everybody will know it."
"19169520","19170480"," The MOC imbalance?"
"19171080","19175740"," No, the MOC imbalanced $5 billion to the buy side trade."
"19175940","19176220"," What is it?"
"19176680","19178160"," Okay, so it's basically that. "
"19178900","19181340"," Do you want to bring it up or a few minutes to show it on the screen, maybe?"
"19182280","19182680"," Sure."
"19182940","19183260"," Me?"
"19183540","19183680"," No."
"19184220","19188200"," I actually, I don't quite understand what you mean by what the trade is. "
"19188300","19189480"," The trade is we're going up tomorrow."
"19190020","19190680"," Oh, sorry."
"19191060","19194180"," I thought you said, I thought you said that the New York Fed. "
"19195120","19199580"," Oh, so that's only in a white paper that said if you had a $5 billion, it was a buy"
"19199580","19200420"," or sell side."
"19200420","19203220"," So it's sell side and it's about $1 billion."
"19203680","19206300"," Okay, so we're in the opposite side of that trade. "
"19206500","19209620"," We're in the opposite side, but at the same time, we're sitting in positive gamma."
"19209960","19217140"," And I've told you this before, the only statistical edge is playing a gap up on a big MOC sell"
"19217140","19221420"," or gap up or, you know, like it goes up at some point during the day where you can get"
"19221420","19227180"," out of your calls for money and buy 0.3 delta calls if the MOC sell is over 3 billion."
"19227860","19229120"," I'm sorry, it's over 1 billion. "
"19229420","19229920"," 1 billion."
"19230420","19231000"," 1 billion."
"19231360","19235800"," If it's on the sell side and it's greater than 1 billion, you buy calls 0.3 delta buy yourself"
"19235800","19236240"," some time. "
"19236680","19238400"," Those calls will go up and you'll make money."
"19238840","19239680"," All right, so let's say we're tired."
"19239840","19242520"," If you get a buy side 1 billion or more, it's a gap up?"
"19243200","19244600"," No, on a sell side. "
"19244980","19245800"," Okay, sorry."
"19246000","19246580"," I can't hear you."
"19246680","19247220"," My headphones. "
"19247560","19247780"," Sorry."
"19248080","19252360"," On the sell side is only when the statistical like trade plays out."
"19252360","19254480"," On the other side, it's all noise. "
"19254840","19256220"," If it's a buy side, you could go up."
"19256340","19256880"," You could go down."
"19257120","19257980"," It doesn't matter. "
"19258060","19259380"," You have to look at other things too."
"19260120","19260120"," Right."
"19260500","19263480"," You have to look at positioning and whatnot and see how the trade goes up or down. "
"19263660","19264540"," You know, like, that's what it is."
"19264860","19274460"," But only statistical edge is where 19 out of 20 trades that you take on an MOC greater than 1"
"19274460","19278600"," billion to the sell side ends up as a net positive."
"19278600","19280320"," Does it get even higher?"
"19280620","19284660"," The more billions you add is you got like 1 billion, 4 billion, 5 billion. "
"19285280","19286220"," Excellent question."
"19286860","19294180"," I have found instances where the MOC sell was like over 5 billion and it was like the beginning of"
"19294180","19295400"," a bloodbath in the market."
"19295740","19296300"," Ooh, interesting. "
"19297400","19301860"," Yeah, we're talking about like five data turns being like negative 4%."
"19301860","19306620"," Did the white paper have a bell curve associated with the sell side billions or was it like there"
"19306620","19307720"," was like a sweet spot or no?"
"19307720","19309000"," No, there isn't."
"19309080","19310900"," That's stuff I've followed up on myself. "
"19312460","19313020"," Interesting."
"19313820","19315800"," Yeah, sorry."
"19316040","19319120"," I should turn that into a white paper instead of just yeah, dude. "
"19319700","19326860"," Plots and codes on my on my on my VS code, you know, kind of like actually blocked that out"
"19326860","19328640"," and I always updated now."
"19329000","19331880"," You've got the BGL white paper, right?"
"19333160","19334300"," I'm not sure."
"19334440","19334920"," I don't think so. "
"19335240","19337100"," So there's like a bunch of guys out there."
"19337200","19344800"," Like a group of guys out there that do white papers on traders style of trading or investing and"
"19344800","19347910"," they back test to see if they statistically have an edge or not."
"19350640","19352260"," And let's see a lot. "
"19352340","19354260"," So this system has a statistical edge."
"19354520","19357240"," It's got a like a .69 edge."
"19357240","19362000"," If you follow the trade, but you have to count the trade you buy and you actually you actually buy"
"19362000","19371340"," the underlying above the the hourly trigger and you're selling your shorting underneath. "
"19372420","19377120"," You accumulate every time underlying a lot of money for it, but it works well."
"19378460","19383060"," Yeah, so I'd love to read that paper."
"19383260","19385300"," Anyways, like there's a lot of stuff like this. "
"19385700","19390440"," The average retailer does not have the time nor the inclination to read, but there's a lot of alpha"
"19390440","19391300"," that comes up."
"19391920","19393020"," I'm going to get to these guys."
"19393240","19394580"," I'm going to get these guys contact. "
"19394860","19395800"," So if you ever want to do that."
"19396020","19396300"," Yeah."
"19396720","19396840"," Yeah. "
"19397140","19402800"," I know you can write it on your own, but they'll get you somebody else wants to write the strategy"
"19402800","19403800"," and test it for me."
"19403800","19404400"," That's great."
"19404720","19408160"," The thing is the issue is getting data for the MOCs. "
