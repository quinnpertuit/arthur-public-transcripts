"508830","510370"," It's been a long week already, right?"
"510530","511970"," I'm assuming that all of you feel like. "
"512150","514929"," I feel like I was talking to Joey, Joey Donut."
"515169","518070"," And I was like, man, I think maybe it was Winky and maybe not it wasn't Joey."
"518590","519870"," I was like, I feel like it's Friday. "
"520230","520710"," This was yesterday."
"521549","523169"," It was like this past some weeks."

"537360","539360"," Never ended with the way the market's trading, right?"
"541800","543720"," So it feels like an extra long week."
"543940","549860"," And whenever I come into these end of these quarterly OPEXes, by the time we get to the 30th. "
"551160","552140"," I'm fucking done."

"577920","580320"," Is it quarterly OPEX vacation time?"
"581260","582440"," But if you're just joining us, welcome."
"582560","582980"," Good morning."
"583180","584900"," Happy Fed rate decision, David. "

"605540","608580"," I posted on Captain Jim James Twitter. "
"610040","612600"," Not the captain's alpha, but Captain Jim James."
"612880","618840"," If you find me on Twitter, if you could repost the link to the live stream for today."
"620500","624780"," So that your followers can pop into the live stream today and appreciate it. "
"625960","626900"," If I get."
"628840","629920"," Ten reposts."
"630900","633860"," I will open up the chat on YouTube. "

"640140","641760"," So ten retweets."
"642600","645720"," I've never asked that before the first time, so I'll ask that once. "

"647440","648600"," Two couple years, right?"
"648700","649160"," Two, three years."

"711130","713950"," You know, when it's time to ship post and all that, that's fine."
"714430","715490"," I'm down with all that. "
"715770","723510"," If we get serious at any point, please bear with us and try to keep it focused on the market."
"725410","728030"," We do have a new squawk this morning for you."
"728030","735150"," So you will have access to the interpretation of the Fed rate decision. "
"735490","738110"," We will also have the Fed rate decision playing for you live."
"739310","741250"," You'll get my commentary on it."
"741350","742670"," We might have a few guests on today. "
"742710","745530"," Sometimes we do during these rate decisions."
"747450","749310"," We can see the bear playing right here."
"754860","757340"," I really appreciate you guys doing that just now. "
"760320","760720"," 100%."
"760720","762660"," I really, really appreciate it."
"762660","764620"," I want to tell you guys, I just saw what you guys did on Twitter. "
"765480","767760"," And I love all of you guys for doing that right now."
"768820","770700"," It's been a long road, a long journey."
"770900","775460"," I was talking to someone this morning that I really trust. "
"775780","779540"," And some of you guys have been here since the beginning."
"779840","787040"," When we were bottoming out last May, last May, last October, last December, remember the sideways"
"787040","789360"," trade that we thought was going to crash and we went up."
"789640","792340"," All of you that have been there, sell side by side, I don't care. "
"794340","800520"," When we were talking about all that macro stuff, about DCAing these bottoms, that we'll look back"
"800520","803780"," in three to five years sooner than that, I guess, right?"
"804280","806360"," Looking back down, it was a tradable bottom to buy."
"807200","809260"," Congratulations to any of you out there that have done that."
"809940","813960"," There weren't that many voices on those bottoms. "
"813960","815980"," Jedi Marcus was one of them."
"816500","823220"," You know, there's a few people out there, but it wasn't the loudness, right?"
"823460","828200"," It was a very small group of traders that were buying those bottoms."
"829340","835440"," So I'm appreciative to those guys with time and market and years and market and that kind of stuff"
"835440","838080"," that were the voice of sanity. "
"839040","842160"," And those same voices are out there right now, the voice of sanity."
"843460","847180"," Talking about the dangers for where we are in the market."
"848600","853280"," Last night I made a post about even if we get a pause or something like that today, do we"
"853280","854280"," squeeze for liquidity?"
"856920","857660"," On that move. "
"857820","859340"," Maybe this morning we can do a poll."
"859720","860660"," Our polls are pretty good."
"861320","863080"," We do a pretty good job. "
"863280","864240"," I got to say something."
"864420","867500"," Our polls used like they started out like 60, 70%."
"868400","871500"," We've been watching them and our polls are outstanding here. "
"872400","880240"," We ask our watchers and followers, listeners to not give an emotional response to give what they"
"880240","881220"," really think will happen."
"881400","887140"," Not their positioning, not their sentiment, but what their brain tells them."
"887800","892320"," Some of these event decisions will be or moves will be. "
"893940","898940"," And the response is usually dead on."
"898940","901740"," So maybe this morning we can start a poll."
"901980","903060"," Is Winky here this morning?"
"904920","907340"," At 9.45 a.m. Eastern time. "
"907540","911420"," We expect comments from German finance minister, Linda, who addresses death by chance."
"911760","914120"," By industry construction summit in Berlin."
"915820","922120"," So what are we looking for on this open is so that we can get winky and we text winky"
"922120","922900"," and see if he's around. "
"927680","933150"," Are you here this morning?"
"938510","939450"," Question mark."
"940070","943130"," I mean, we can't really do anything without winky being here, right?"
"943950","945030"," Guy is like."
"947050","948470"," Solid help towards us. "
"948590","949190"," So number one."
"949970","951950"," On these FMC rate decisions."
"953730","959410"," Not every time, but. "
"959410","960670"," We're going to go up here."
"960850","962270"," Sometimes you'll see a move like."
"963550","965450"," This and you'll see a move like. "
"966670","969270"," This you'll see a couple attempts to grab."
"969690","970810"," Not grab liquidity, but."
"971430","972150"," It'll push us up. "
"973270","974930"," It'll seem like we're going up."
"976130","977530"," And then the hedge comes on."
"977670","979610"," We dump 15, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. "
"979630","981850"," Looks like they made an attempt right off the bell this morning."
"984010","986910"," We'll put a we'll do today is we're going to put up a."
"986910","988210"," A poll."
"988470","989230"," I have to be honest with you. "
"990270","993910"," I have not been spending a lot of time on Twitter looking at Twitter sentiment."
"995810","999390"," So a lot of there's been a lot of fast moving sentiments on Twitter."
"1000190","1003810"," I didn't notice that everyone was talking about. "
"1004650","1005910"," An actual pause."
"1007670","1011190"," I saw the the futures fed fund rate and that stuff."
"1011430","1012330"," I saw like the headlines. "
"1014450","1016470"," But I didn't know so much about."
"1018750","1019750"," The cacophony of."
"1020590","1021970"," We're getting a pause today. "
"1024270","1026010"," The betting on that trade today."
"1026130","1027890"," Some fascinated to find out this morning."
"1032210","1033730"," Both croissant is going to help us out. "
"1033910","1034450"," Thanks croissant."
"1034490","1034869"," I love you, brother."
"1035730","1037410"," Can you do a poll that says. "
"1038210","1038410"," Let me see."
"1038490","1040089"," I can write this down so make sure you get this right."
"1040250","1040450"," Hold on. "
"1041450","1044869"," How about we do 50 BPS."
"1045750","1050380"," Twenty five BPS."
"1051460","1052500"," Pause. "
"1053560","1055280"," Twenty five BPS."
"1061700","1063720"," No pause."
"1065540","1072000"," There's another one in there. "
"1072000","1072440"," There's another pause."
"1074160","1075160"," With threat."
"1075500","1075740"," Hold on. "
"1083060","1085980"," And no rate increase."
"1088240","1090420"," Or just zero BPS about that."
"1090640","1092040"," So we'll do that. "
"1092200","1093180"," We'll do it like this."
"1093420","1094820"," We'll do 50 BPS."
"1096100","1097460"," Zero BPS. "
"1098480","1099200"," So 50 BPS."
"1099880","1100340"," Zero BPS."
"1103160","1104720"," And then we'll do. "
"1109100","1110900"," Twenty five BPS."
"1111680","1112240"," Pause."
"1112500","1113660"," Twenty five BPS. "
"1114020","1114380"," No pause."
"1115280","1116220"," Make it simple."
"1117660","1121260"," The no pause can include people that think that they'll be threat. "
"1121500","1124820"," So we're going to discuss that this morning because I don't know if that can happen."
"1126240","1127440"," Discussing that last night."
"1127440","1129820"," Can he do like twenty five BPS. "
"1130620","1132980"," Pause in the press release."
"1134140","1138560"," And then can he successfully go into the presser and threaten the market."
"1139920","1141140"," I don't know that he can do that. "
"1141260","1143180"," That's what I think is the best thing to do."
"1143300","1145140"," But I don't think that he can actually do that."
"1145300","1150000"," It's too dangerous because once that press release hits the wire. "
"1151040","1152240"," The market is on right."
"1152840","1155720"," Fed pauses rates boom splash headline."
"1159440","1161340"," So for him though, thread that needle. "
"1161580","1162660"," I don't know that he can do that."
"1163100","1165240"," And we'll discuss to what your thoughts are."
"1166500","1167680"," What a pause means. "
"1170340","1171860"," What your take on that is."
"1173560","1175320"," They don't like to shock markets."
"1175540","1179920"," They like to like increment or at least right now incrementally. "
"1181540","1182720"," Make those changes."
"1183180","1183600"," We've seen."

"1197640","1199440"," But we're going to raise down the road. "
"1200160","1202000"," But they really got to thread that needle."

"1209240","1211260"," They would they would shock us all the time. "
"1213360","1215360"," And they said those days were over."
"1215620","1217060"," Jerome was like we're not going to do that."
"1217240","1219600"," You're going to get telegraphed in the future. "
"1219800","1220640"," What's going to happen?"
"1221380","1222780"," There'll be no shocks right now."
"1222840","1223880"," The market can't take it."
"1224060","1225900"," And then when of course twenty twenty two. "

"1574730","1577750"," Dairy Doug say pause with threats based on data. "
"1583860","1585400"," Yeah, what about Budweiser?"
"1585500","1587180"," We talked about them yesterday too, right?"
"1587360","1589540"," We're trying to make a point about Budweiser yesterday."
"1589840","1591760"," We're looking it on a higher time frame."
"1593480","1596900"," And it looks bullish as all fuck on a higher time frame, right?"
"1597860","1601940"," I understand the sentiment out there as to why it's down. "
"1603860","1605920"," But I always try to read into sentiment."
"1607140","1609460"," Find out why that sentiment is actually there."
"1609700","1610760"," It's usually greed, right?"
"1615740","1616900"," Almost always greed. "
"1627870","1630270"," Previous how you want to see some targets to the upside?"

"1748650","1752330"," Yeah, it's been a discord's been a challenge for a lot of people."
"1752550","1757450"," They say that DM the bots are inside of all these DMS or inside of all these discords. "
"1759110","1763410"," Supposedly if we were to turn on like some kind of a subscription model that was like a dollar or"
"1763410","1764570"," $5 or something."
"1765170","1767350"," It gets rid of that's why we turn them."
"1767550","1773550"," That's that's one of the reasons we turn the memberships on for five bucks on Twitch and YouTube. "
"1774410","1780270"," This it like it cancels out all the scammers or like the drive by commenters."
"1780350","1783970"," That kind of stuff makes the moderators job easier."
"1784670","1787050"," Same thing kind of applies to discord. "
"1787550","1788910"," You have a free entry discord."
"1789750","1790990"," They just it's ramp."
"1791190","1795010"," It's not rampant, but you attract scammers and stuff like that. "
"1799320","1805300"," Yeah, when you get a when you get a when you get a message from one of us, our names"
"1805300","1806720"," will be a different color."

"1813900","1818100"," Check check their names like blind nest owl is a bright green. "
"1820420","1823020"," And I believe I am light blue."
"1823440","1827400"," So you want to check to see and I think there's another way to check as well with the actual"
"1827400","1827820"," name."
"1841860","1845600"," You guys remember that stuff you guys remember the YouTube free camgirls from Russia. "
"1846900","1851140"," We used to have like YouTube camgirls from Russia said to put subscriber only on."
"1852620","1857700"," I want if you're watching right now for today for the FMC if you're watching on YouTube."
"1857700","1861340"," You can join us in the chat. "

"1872660","1874380"," We have a pretty easy going chat here."
"1889300","1890640"," Yeah, you want to see what that's one."
"1890780","1893140"," We'll talk about the we're going to talk about. "
"1893140","1901240"," So your intraday pivot here positive negative is four thirty six eighteen."
"1902260","1907300"," That's one four thirty five oh five over here."
"1907780","1909300"," This is the trend. "
"1909440","1909840"," Let me see them."
"1910140","1911460"," It's kind of like a monkey right now."
"1912260","1913420"," Sometimes I get these. "
"1913760","1918920"," I need some of this here real quick for you so you can get a get an idea of where"
"1918920","1919310"," we are."
"1919310","1922990"," We'll talk about the day and what the expectations are."
"1923290","1925930"," We're going to look at the implied move for today as well. "
"1931270","1933820"," We talked about this trend on Friday, right?"
"1934500","1935740"," How much time."
"1936640","1940020"," The Sunday stream in discord we discussed."
"1940960","1943360"," Bull's don't have a lot of time to get up here, right?"
"1943880","1946400"," They only have until Wednesday and they've done it. "
"1946400","1950180"," I mean, this was a little absurd."
"1950560","1953040"," I'll be honest with you on Friday and on Sunday."
"1953220","1960440"," I was like, we have a lot of a lot of running to do between here and Wednesday. "
"1961020","1962780"," And I got to give you guys hats off."
"1962960","1963400"," Congratulations."
"1964720","1968200"," The move was monster to get here. "
"1970760","1972520"," So this is trend here."
"1973100","1976000"," We're going to look at where the hourly trigger is this morning."
"1976000","1979320"," And we're going to talk about hourly trigger. "
"1979540","1981500"," We're going to talk about the daily trigger."
"1981840","1982380"," 435."
"1985180","1986260"," And some change. "
"1986900","1988700"," This hourly trigger is now ready for this."
"1989860","1990980"," Right here."
"1991660","1993060"," I'm going to hide that is. "
"1994380","1996820"," It's just cranking in the background of the upside."
"1997120","1998800"," I'll show you this at another chart just a moment."
"1999400","2000180"," The hourly trigger though. "
"2000640","2002140"," This is support right here."
"2002780","2004660"," This is trend, this green bar."
"2005780","2008900"," This is an important one to always be paying attention to. "
"2009280","2015220"," If we break this one and reject under it, this yellow line will mean nothing."
"2016180","2018560"," It'll be a speed bump along the way."
"2019420","2027740"," So if we break trend here and start rejecting to the downside, we will be probably not today. "
"2027740","2033760"," You probably wouldn't see that move until after a repricing of volcrush."
"2034400","2038920"," But your target to the downside, the daily trigger right now is that."
"2041260","2044000"," That's moved up to way down here. "
"2044060","2050880"," And it's moved up to right about here right where that gap is down there."
"2051020","2052000"," Daily triggers moved up."
"2052880","2053480"," Shocker. "
"2055659","2059380"," If we have some negative news, do I think you get down here today?"
"2060080","2060880"," Likely not."
"2063239","2064400"," It's more about the dealers."
"2065639","2069280"," If you get that move, if that happens, anything that happened in the stock market, we know that. "
"2069960","2072540"," But I'm not going to expect that move, that full move."
"2072820","2076679"," We'll look at what the implied move is today on a few moments."
"2077000","2078120"," But I just want you to see that's trend. "
"2079320","2084280"," The hourly trigger is something that you need to get under if you're a seller."
"2086620","2088159"," You can't get underneath this."
"2088440","2091000"," They are going to push you up and up and up and up. "
"2094179","2097640"," We'll put some ranges on here for you today of what to expect."
"2097920","2101080"," I think somebody was saying 82 points was the implied move for today."
"2101080","2103900"," It could be wrong on that right now. "
"2104180","2107300"," I'll take a peek in the background and see what it says."
"2136290","2146990"," So today's implied move is 440.99. No, 441.03."
"2147870","2148770"," My God."
"2152310","2155210"," So basically this red bar, we'll bring this red bar down a little bit. "
"2162010","2163790"," That's a big implied move for today."
"2164790","2166430"," That's the abnormal for us."
"2168890","2169370"," 43373. "
"2172530","2174730"," Oh, someone's going to be off sides here today."
"2188100","2190180"," So this is your implied move that I have."
"2190340","2192020"," If you guys disagree with that, let me know. "
"2205810","2207110"," Right there for today."
"2210030","2211250"," That one up a little bit."
"2211470","2212270"," Get rid of that one. "
"2215150","2216430"," One doesn't mean nothing."
"2218850","2220890"," One doesn't mean anything either."
"2222490","2224550"," All you need to see right there is right there. "
"2230900","2232620"," There's your implied move for today."
"2233360","2239420"," You also do want you to know that when we hit these implied moves, you'll see reprising events"
"2239420","2240160"," along the way."
"2240820","2242160"," Let's say run down here. "
"2242380","2242800"," Run up here."
"2242920","2243420"," Run up here."
"2243560","2244020"," Run up here. "
"2244460","2246640"," You will see that 2 to 30."
"2248240","2253440"," Multiple multiple 2 to 3 repricings in the options chain."
"2266040","2267280"," Take a look on. "
"2270160","2271220"," Look at that."
"2271340","2277240"," Look at that up there, man."
"2278160","2280580"," Look at that upside target right there. "
"2281560","2283420"," That's stink that way up there."
"2283600","2285420"," Supplies like, come on up here, man."
"2286020","2287440"," I'm waiting for you. "
"2290920","2292280"," Oh boy."
"2297250","2298810"," Today's option chain."
"2299250","2300130"," Everybody's on calls. "
"2300250","2301690"," 438 C's."
"2302510","2305590"," $1.42. 440 C's."
"2307230","2308170"," 67 cents right now. "
"2309990","2314470"," Everybody's long on options there on FMC rate decision day."
"2314990","2319270"," People slamming the zero date call button."
"2323410","2325090"," Oh boy. "
"2325590","2328170"," Oh boy."
"2329050","2329650"," I'll tell you what."
"2330290","2332270"," Slamming the zero date call button. "
"2334290","2334850"," Let's see."
"2334930","2335210"," We see."
"2335550","2336810"," We're going to look at some other things. "
"2337210","2349670"," The one minute"
"2349670","2350010"," chart."
"2353730","2354690"," Bam, bam."

"2641460","2643640"," With the new changes in discord."
"2645680","2648480"," Allowing members to change their user names."
"2649300","2654240"," Scammers are now able to add your unique identifier to their user names. "
"2654760","2657920"," Seems like they're required out of space and their user names to differentiate."
"2662410","2665170"," Thanks, Raveology for giving us an update on that."
"2693080","2697820"," Previous I from 2022, can we get up there and tag it please for 38 29. "

"2709510","2710590"," Hey, baby."
"2716270","2717910"," Yeah, it's a discord thing. "
"2718150","2720330"," Like anytime they make changes like that, right?"
"2720510","2722110"," It's like brings out all the smart people."
"2722590","2725690"," They're like, let's punch some holes and whatever they're changing."
"2730990","2734190"," I do want you to know that you will never get. "
"2734770","2739510"," I want you to know if you are in discord, I want you to know that you will never get."
"2740070","2741610"," A DM for me."
"2743270","2744350"," Asking for money. "
"2744790","2748150"," You'll never get a DM for me asking you to sign up for anything."
"2749750","2751710"," Maybe I should post that right now and there."
"2812650","2814830"," So I just posted inside discord. "
"2814870","2819230"," I will never DM you asking you to give me money or to request for you to click a link"
"2819230","2821310"," or join any paid service."
"2822150","2829910"," If you follow me anywhere, you will never ever ever see me asking you for money in a DM or"
"2829910","2832110"," call my phone number or anything like that."
"2833410","2835890"," That's not how it goes. "
"2836210","2839330"," So if you ever get a request like that or hey, follow me to this link."
"2839990","2845010"," As a matter of fact, the only time I will ever DM you."
"2845390","2847870"," If you're like, hey, well, how will I know if it's a DM from UCAP?"
"2848870","2851870"," You and I will have a conversation publicly first. "
"2853110","2858630"," So if you ever see a DM for me, it should be something like, hey, cap, you and I are"
"2858630","2861330"," like, or hey, uh, add Joe donut."
"2861650","2864230"," I was speaking with you publicly."
"2864630","2866510"," And that means like we've never had a conversation. "
"2867250","2870170"," I've never spoken to you publicly in a public forum somewhere."
"2871090","2874310"," And I would immediately DM you right like moments later."
"2874590","2875930"," Hey, I'm going to send you a DM. "
"2877070","2882350"," So if you ever see a DM for me that's unsolicited, never believe it."
"2883250","2886230"," Find me publicly and say, hey, captain, just send me a DM."
"2887090","2888450"," It's a very common thing. "
"2890130","2893110"," And scammers run these things all the time."
"2893470","2894970"," You will never ever get that from me."
"2895030","2896170"," You'll never get anything crazy. "
"2897190","2901170"," I'll never send you like when we talk on stream sometimes about feet picks."
"2901870","2902850"," That's a big joke."
"2902850","2906810"," You'll never actually see me send you real like my feet picks. "
"2907750","2914670"," You'll never see like requests for porn or, um, you'll never see me come after like, hey, you want"
"2914670","2917070"," to have internet sex or something crazy like that."
"2917350","2918370"," I'm not doing any of that shit."
"2918590","2921290"," I've got like a whole family normal life. "
"2922190","2923390"," Oh, that kind of stuff."
"2923630","2927310"," So, uh, if you ever see anything like that, it's not me."
"2927850","2929370"," 100% of the time. "
"2937100","2937540"," Yeah."
"2937680","2937720"," Yeah."
"2937920","2940220"," I think I will sometimes send my close friends. "
"2940840","2945860"," If I know you and we've conversed publicly on any public space, I'll sometimes send you like Hobbit"
"2945860","2947400"," feet picks or something like that."
"2947520","2950300"," But it's, you know, that's, that's the extent of it."
"2950360","2952200"," It's more of like just joking amongst friends. "
"2954580","2955700"," There's nothing nefarious."
"2960040","2962940"," Let's talk, uh, you know, let's, we have a minute here, Nino."
"2963600","2970400"," So does, does anybody in this chat on Twitter, YouTube know anything about UNH, the stock ticker?"
"2971360","2973600"," Uh, we'll talk about UNH really quick. "
"2973940","2983680"," So, uh, it's, it's funny because my wife is, my wife, as a matter of fact, the dips"
"2983680","2984980"," being bought this morning, right?"
"2986080","2988480"," So, I think that it's being bought on UNH this morning."
"2989080","2992220"," Now, it says UNH, right?"
"2992420","2998180"," What's, what's fascinating about it is, my wife works in healthcare."
"2998660","3005740"," She's a PT for a major healthcare provider and she has no idea what the stock market is. "
"3006520","3014880"," And I'm asking her what her thoughts are on why a healthcare provider would be down."
"3014880","3019180"," And she said that it had likely had to do with the change in COVID laws."
"3021080","3028060"," And that Medicare and Medicaid recipients are being kicked off the rolls because they're no longer"
"3028060","3028600"," eligible. "
"3029900","3037460"," Now I'm always fascinated by that news because if you're short of ticker, you can like trigger that"
"3037460","3039160"," last capitulation cell."
"3040160","3047720"," Uh, so I, I personally don't know, uh, like, is that news because they want to get a good buy"
"3047720","3048220"," in on it."
"3049540","3052160"," Uh, or if it's because they've been downgraded. "
"3052400","3054200"," This stream is sponsored by Ticksright."
"3054740","3059140"," Ticksright allows you to actually hear water flowing futures, forex and stock instruments."
"3059980","3060840"," Get a free trial. "
"3060940","3065120"," Now they've been downgraded from some rating agencies."
"3065600","3070280"," Uh, I asked my wife if, uh, how she knew this."
"3070380","3073420"," And she said that patients of hers are no longer eligible. "
"3073420","3078040"," So that might be a real thing where you and H gets repriced."
"3078660","3082540"," So just briefly, we'll look at a few different things for UNH."
"3082760","3085700"," This was Nino had a request in discord yesterday on this. "
"3086620","3088580"," And we're going to look at it briefly here."
"3088720","3089320"," We have some time."
"3089500","3091380"," I know that we're doing, uh, we're doing today, but. "
"3091380","3093680"," Just UNH."
"3094120","3097600"," Uh, by the way, we're looking to tag this 438 29 if you didn't know."
"3098340","3100380"," We also have our three above that. "
"3101520","3102560"," 438 89."
"3104300","3106320"," Now it's fascinating about UNH is."
"3107040","3110180"," I mean, this is a huge company, right?"
"3110820","3112060"," Uh, they're massive. "
"3115430","3117370"," And they're huge company."
"3117650","3120470"," I mean, they just go up and up and up and up and up."
"3121030","3122770"," Right, but let's look at something here. "
"3123510","3126710"," Now we're in where seasonally we're in health care."
"3127530","3129430"," Seasonally from like March to December."
"3131290","3133710"," But here's that 2020 low down here. "
"3133890","3135390"," This was way back $180."
"3136970","3138670"," And they never really took a clip."
"3138850","3139090"," Did they?"
"3139970","3143750"," Uh, this looks like a, say, back off, but it's not wack off. "
"3144090","3147130"," It's white off, but I'll say they do look like they're in distribution."
"3147910","3149810"," There's a giant gap down here."
"3150530","3152790"," There is some fundamental reason. "
"3154050","3159950"," If we're going to change the COVID laws for it to be reprised, even if our population is getting"
"3159950","3160310"," older."
"3160970","3163150"," So I am hesitating on."
"3164230","3165790"," Saying, yeah, you buy this. "
"3167750","3169790"," Uh, there's something else to look at here."
"3169950","3172330"," If you're a sell side, I want to show you something here."
"3172510","3172570"," Okay. "
"3172690","3173310"," It's an important thing."
"3173310","3174230"," Important lesson here."
"3176130","3178970"," This is a daily chart, okay, on UNH. "
"3179770","3181730"," They have shown the bear plane here."
"3183230","3184170"," You see it."
"3184290","3185390"," This is S&P did this. "
"3186270","3188010"," They came back up for air."
"3188950","3191290"," And liquidity sold right here."
"3191450","3193090"," More liquidity and sold right down. "
"3194130","3198450"," Uh, as far as I'm concerned, this ticker is extremely bearish."
"3199170","3201190"," Uh, this setup right here."
"3201190","3204030"," We're building alerts for these setups right now. "
"3204210","3208510"," When you see these setups here, they usually are bearish for many months."
"3209910","3217370"," So personally, even if there's a dip by here, even if we leave this gap here, I would be very"
"3217370","3219670"," concerned of trying to buy a dip on UNH."
"3220110","3222770"," Just looking at this right here, this structure right here. "
"3223450","3225670"," Uh, very wary."
"3225950","3226730"," It's not bullish."
"3226730","3231430"," This would be fair and greed index 81 out of 100 signaling extreme greed. "
"3231810","3235570"," And the crypto fair and greed index 46 out of 100 signaling fair."
"3236810","3239790"," Something like this is something that I'd be looking for."
"3240650","3242910"," I'd be like, yeah, you want to buy that dip up here?"
"3244890","3248950"," Looking for another opportunity to sell down here and take all that stuff down there. "
"3250210","3252150"," Be wary of this ticker here."
"3252190","3252830"," I got to tell you."
"3252830","3255790"," Now, if you want to buy the dip on this ticker, we'll look at that too. "
"3255950","3257830"," If you're like, hey, cap, you're fucking wrong on this."
"3258510","3259990"," Uh, I get it."
"3260270","3268090"," Now, if there's a fundamental reason for repricing of some of these healthcare companies, be really"
"3268090","3269070"," cautious here. "
"3269490","3272270"," You see suspect growth went through this."
"3272430","3274250"," They got repriced and now they're coming back."
"3275070","3276470"," Uh, so just be conscious. "
"3277110","3278570"," Good old fashioned profit taking."
"3278890","3280150"," Nothing ever wrong with that, right?"
"3280150","3284330"," And if they've got a fundamental reason to profit take, they will."
"3284570","3287010"," And if the shorts can step in on this ticker, they will. "
"3287670","3297810"," So on a 30 minute chart, it looks great on UNH, but on a longer term velocity chart, it"
"3297810","3298410"," looks ugly."
"3299530","3300730"," It does look ugly."
"3301130","3309410"," Now, if you want some confirmation to the downside move, you want some confirmation on the downside"
"3309410","3309970"," move. "
"3310170","3311110"," I'm going to show it to you right now."
"3311290","3312270"," Take a snapshot of that."
"3313370","3318010"," If you get this, this breather back up here, you start consolidating like this. "
"3318390","3320450"," And this daily comes down."
"3321250","3323830"," That could be your plunge to the downside."
"3324390","3327270"," So track this all the way down right here. "
"3328810","3331050"," You see giant squeezes."
"3331150","3333850"," You know that volatility, right?"
"3334010","3334650"," It's not bullish."
"3335510","3339750"," Just be really careful on really careful here on UNH. "
"3340050","3348930"," If you wanted to get bullish to get on UNH, you are looking to trade above $494 until"
"3348930","3350550"," that happens."
"3358430","3366230"," So just making note of yesterday's API data crude or stock change came in at one spot 024 million."
"3366690","3368450"," So that was a build on the forecast there. "
"3368570","3372650"," So API coming in yesterday at one spot 024 million."
"3373250","3375450"," That doesn't mean you short it right now, either."
"3375450","3379610"," The short already happened, but every time UNH gets up there. "
"3380730","3385530"," You want to record like, like pause this program, go back and take a snip of it."
"3386250","3393630"," And then, you know, whenever we're up there on those lines, you fucking short that shit with a stop"
"3393630","3394050"," above."
"3394730","3397730"," 11% to 40 euros per megawatt hour. "
"3397970","3403610"," Congratulations, bulls tagging the previous high of 2022 for 38."
"3404090","3410230"," Well, close enough for 48 21 close enough for the anger nades and horseshoes for me."
"3411470","3418650"," When I put those ticks in there, we're at 14,874 on Nuzdaq. "
"3422610","3428310"," Look at that."
"3429130","3430450"," How far out me up?"
"3430730","3432950"," I was putting those lines in on the fly too."
"3433090","3434150"," So that could have been the tack. "
"3434290","3435770"," That could have been the tick right there."
"3438510","3440430"," I thought I got them exact, but hold on."
"3440490","3441090"," Let me look and see. "
"3441730","3443830"," Nuzdaq still hasn't touched the tick yet."
"3444270","3444930"," It's close."
"3448650","3449310"," Nuzdaq. "
"3449990","3451490"," Big daddy out there."
"3451650","3454490"," 14 974, 66."
"3470090","3474970"," 1022, bulls in charge, eight minutes left for the bulls to the hourly. "
"3476030","3479970"," Come back down here, check this, try to slam up there."
"3482090","3485150"," Bulls have till another seven minutes to get up there."
"3502530","3503410"," Come down here. "
"3503470","3505190"," They're going to check this one right here."
"3506010","3507030"," 437, 82."
"3507490","3509090"," We'll see if they can get one more pump up. "
"3509110","3510970"," Eight more minutes, seven more minutes for the bulls."
"3515660","3517240"," I'm watching this in the background."
"3517380","3517760"," I'm like. "
"3523040","3527600"," Read some of this shit right now on."
"3528140","3529560"," Read some of this stuff."
"3535560","3537980"," Read some of this stuff right now in discord. "
"3540300","3545930"," So yeah, UNH, man, I'm not."
"3546110","3550910"," And I'll give you another note too here is Binky sent me something this morning."
"3550910","3552590"," I'm going to read what he texted me this morning. "
"3553370","3563330"," He said, UNH and health care drop is driven by concerns about Medicaid payouts."
"3564750","3570650"," The trigger was Goldman Sachs, dude, acknowledging that insurance claims are higher from a from a"
"3570650","3575730"," high number of surgery for seniors who delayed health care because of co-help."
"3575730","3580870"," If you want some company on the stream for the rate decision, I'm happy to join. "
"3582910","3585850"," Sweet, so maybe we'll get Binky on here today at some point here."
"3586030","3586510"," Hear him."

"3675310","3677270"," Looks like we just need a rejection candle."
"3677270","3685370"," Vic's on 1444, Vic's trying, maybe trying to get back up there and just prove the point at 1457 and"

"3883190","3886890"," Maybe they're giving you alerts for a day trade or a five minute or one minute trade."
"3887310","3887910"," That's possible. "
"3888510","3892250"," But for me personally, I'm not putting size on this to the upside."
"3892850","3900090"," I'll trade zero dates, stuff like that, but it's a big no-go for me on size in the market"
"3900090","3900570"," right now."
"3901170","3902930"," Size in the market was a long time ago. "
"3903110","3906570"," It was like October, December, March, seven spots, nine, one."

"3930910","3932210"," One spot, five, five, four million. "
"3932610","3935950"," So taking a look at WTI, but a downside movement there after the storage build."
"3938110","3939290"," Yeah, the options are priced."
"3939530","3940910"," The price to play today is big. "
"3942930","3945010"," Usually that means there's a trap somewhere, right?"
"3945390","3952630"," I do want you all to know that if you are long calls, long puts, anything like that, that as"

"4050610","4054970"," You can be in a trade and it'll be going directionally where you want it to go."
"4055150","4058450"," And yet you'll be upside down on that trade."
"4058650","4061550"," You'll pick the right direction and you'll actually be losing money. "
"4064150","4065470"," Sweet, I'm making money here."
"4065690","4068710"," So we have the weekly EIA report."
"4069830","4071930"," I was finally able to get into a trade here. "
"4075910","4078770"," I bought that bar down here right down here."
"4078910","4080850"," I bought that white line right there."
"4081210","4082830"," That's my friend, man, long and short. "
"4086430","4095170"," If you don't understand what that line is, you don't understand what we're talking about on that"

"4096910","4098550"," Let's see if I can get you guys the."
"4100770","4104350"," There's a trader out there that does a simplified version of this. "
"4104630","4106069"," He keeps it nice and simple."
"4107410","4110529"," His name is Jedi Marcus."
"4111250","4113529"," And I have a lot of trust him. "
"4113890","4115569"," If you don't already follow him."
"4117109","4118510"," I trust him greatly."
"4118850","4119550"," Let me see if I can. "
"4120210","4122630"," I don't know if this will work, but."
"4125590","4129450"," So I trust him with a lot of trust."
"4130050","4131970"," He's one of my favorite follows. "
"4133830","4135029"," On fin to it."
"4135130","4137130"," If you don't know who he is, follow him."
"4137689","4139910"," This is a white paper that was done for him. "
"4140890","4142149"," Not his trading style."
"4142930","4144450"," You can click on that."
"4147550","4148630"," And read it. "
"4148630","4153189"," And you should read it because that's how professional traders trade."
"4155990","4157270"," Individual tickers."
"4157990","4158630"," Indexes. "
"4159370","4160609"," ETNs doesn't matter."
"4161430","4163210"," So take a look at that."
"4165029","4167950"," And you can easily follow along with what we do here. "
"4168470","4170450"," We do something similar, not exactly that."
"4170750","4172770"," We incorporate a few other things."
"4174050","4174689"," Incorporate velocity. "
"4174689","4175229"," Market velocity."
"4176569","4179890"," We also incorporate bull and bear planes."
"4180229","4180810"," That kind of stuff. "
"4181990","4186850"," But for a base understanding, you'll be able to follow along just easily with that paper."
"4187510","4191550"," We also involve other time frames on a 27 and a 129 EMA."
"4191689","4193570"," We also use a 129 EMA. "
"4193690","4197630"," And then we use multiple time frames daily, hourly, 15, 5 and one minute."
"4198270","4199230"," But you don't need that."
"4199290","4202190"," You just need that right there and that'll give you a base understanding of what we're talking"
"4202190","4202490"," about. "
"4213710","4215010"," Thanks for posting that."
"4216710","4218730"," Can you add everyone on that, Joe?"
"4219970","4224330"," Can you can you do it at everyone and post that in the discord for everybody?"
"4225150","4229450"," Just tell them that's a simplified version, maybe some of that version of what cap trades."
"4230250","4232550"," Or what we trade with the group trades as a whole. "
"4253130","4255650"," So Henry Chang is asking some questions here."
"4256430","4260090"," I'm not as tired today as the past couple of days have been very tired."
"4260310","4262550"," Let me see if I can get this right. "
"4262670","4263330"," I usually get it right."
"4263430","4264570"," I've got a whole spiel on this."
"4265370","4270470"," You've got different market forces at play, right?"
"4271310","4273930"," That's why price goes up and price goes down. "
"4275010","4276210"," Give me a moment here."
"4276310","4279690"," I try to like try to simplify this for people."
"4280810","4282030"," Give me like five minutes. "
"4282130","4285450"," I got to think about this again because I was able to, for a long time, I was able to"
"4285450","4286230"," describe it to people."
"4286850","4289450"," And I've gotten so tired of describing it."
"4289550","4290030"," It's not you. "
"4290550","4294590"," It's that for my own self, I've just gotten tired of describing trying to simplify it for people."
"4295690","4300030"," But the gist is that you've got different market forces out there, right?"
"4300210","4303710"," That are always trying to tug and pull on the marketplace."
"4303710","4309210"," And you've got dealers that are always trying to stay in front of all of it, right?"
"4310230","4312210"," You've got hedges from institutions. "
"4313270","4314770"," You've got retail money."
"4315530","4316930"," You've got dealer money."
"4317210","4320150"," You've got retail institution dealer money. "
"4320310","4321670"," You've got hedge fund smaller players."
"4322150","4324630"," You've got high net worth individuals."
"4326150","4328590"," Sometimes they're even asked to provide liquidity to the market. "
"4330750","4333930"," You've got dealers that try to stay in the stay neutral, right?"
"4334150","4335610"," At all times they're trying to stay neutral."
"4335730","4338790"," If they can't stay neutral, they chase, right?"
"4338970","4340950"," They will actually follow you on a trade."
"4342210","4345770"," They can help people out in a trade, believe it or not. "
"4346490","4350610"," So they're not always against you in that trade."
"4350930","4355530"," And then you've got institutions in the background that actually try to impact the options market"
"4356210","4358650"," with their hedging, right, bear seagulls, stuff like that."
"4358850","4363890"," They'll actually try to try to try to lower volatility in the market with their own trades. "
"4364090","4368070"," Then you've got other players following all that shit from these banks."
"4369450","4375890"," So you always like rolling influences in the marketplace."
"4379290","4382630"," And then you've got real money buying and real money selling, right?"
"4382950","4383570"," You'll hear that sometimes. "
"4383570","4385430"," Real money buying, real money selling."
"4386290","4388170"," Some of this stuff is already known, right?"
"4388270","4390050"," You have events that are already known that are going to take place."
"4391830","4395450"," That can trigger real money buying, real money selling. "
"4395990","4400110"," You've also got dealers that can get trapped into real money buying and not selling."
"4401310","4404630"," And truly right now where the market is, it needs an event."
"4405930","4407050"," It needs an event. "
"4407470","4409950"," It needs like these institutions that are trying to sell."
"4409950","4413190"," Well, they're crazy hedged."
"4414270","4417970"," And you need like an event to trigger all of this to happen at the same time. "
"4418190","4419250"," Some fear, some kind."
"4420350","4423530"," So unless that happens, you see what's happening right now, right?"
"4423670","4426310"," We're just infinite squeeze in the marketplace."
"4431380","4433560"," Apparently it needs life as an FLEX. "
"4434820","4435760"," Netflix, man."
"4436220","4438580"," Like I was on, we were talking about this in the stream the other day."
"4439460","4440860"," Reddit's been solid lately. "
"4440860","4443360"," They had a huge post like two weeks ago."
"4444020","4449000"," Well, first off, Reddit was like, we're not going to, people are like, I pay 10 bucks a month for"
"4449000","4451740"," Netflix and I share it with my entire extended family."
"4452140","4453020"," It lives around the world. "
"4453520","4456020"," And I ain't paying when they turn it off."
"4456740","4460300"," Of course, you know that's like an 18 year old kid speaking right in college."
"4461540","4462860"," And you know they are going to pay. "
"4463940","4468400"," And Netflix just like turned it all off and said, fuck you, you're going to pay."
"4468400","4473320"," And you know, you know the rest, right?"
"4473800","4476620"," Everyone signed up for Netflix from that extended family."
"4477360","4479380"," People are like, I'm not going to sign up for Netflix. "
"4479780","4480700"," Everybody has Netflix."
"4481900","4482920"," Airbnb's have Netflix."
"4483260","4483640"," You name it. "
"4483740","4484540"," Everybody's got a Netflix."
"4485000","4491340"," Can you imagine the number of Airbnb's that were tethering off from their personal accounts?"
"4491580","4492640"," Every Airbnb is staying."
"4493280","4495080"," It's like, this is Jim Bob's Netflix. "
"4495080","4497040"," I'm like, oh, this must be their home Netflix."
"4497660","4502100"," And they got like softcore porn in their history and shit."
"4505280","4508120"," So you're like, well, what about all those Airbnb's?"
"4508140","4509200"," How many Airbnb's is that?"
"4509360","4511980"," They're now going to have to sign up for Netflix. "
"4512760","4515140"," So their roles are going to be stupid."
"4515880","4516040"," Right?"
"4516320","4516720"," Stupid."
"4516960","4517500"," They're next ER. "
"4524610","4526670"," Oh, yeah, you can see the confirmation here."
"4526770","4528110"," I want you guys to know this, right?"
"4528110","4531730"," So we're trading above the white line in the five minute chart, right?"
"4532270","4535990"," And when we're able to get above it, you have some confirmations."
"4536290","4537610"," One and two. "
"4538190","4538810"," What does that mean?"
"4539550","4541110"," Rip faces off to the upside."
"4548330","4549770"," Tag the previous side."
"4549950","4552110"," If you want to take some profit there, I don't blame you. "
"4559790","4560890"," More targets above."
"4561130","4562690"," You can see the supply right up here."
"4562770","4564250"," That big old orange bar. "
"4564450","4565310"," It's just screaming at you."
"4565410","4566110"," Come on up here."
"4572330","4572850"," Vamo. "
"4575010","4576350"," Beautiful thing right there."
"4576470","4576590"," Right?"
"4576750","4577130"," See that?"
"4577550","4581570"," One and two."
"4583570","4584090"," Three. "
"4584350","4587570"," One thing I will say to you is normally on a trend day."
"4590190","4594250"," Not always, but normally a trend day will never retest this five minute."
"4594250","4597090"," Oh, there's a big retest right there in that five. "
"4599010","4603090"," Usually is not a sign of two or three more rips to the upside."
"4603490","4604570"," Maybe one or two at most."
"4605910","4611950"," Whenever I see these five minute tests down here, I'm like, yeah, we're bullish, but time is"
"4611950","4612670"," waiting on it. "
"4614650","4616730"," So be cautious as we get up here."
"4618250","4621790"," You've got our two at four thirty eight eighty nine."
"4625980","4627280"," That's a one minute chart. "
"4633960","4635280"," Here's the five minute chart."
"4636800","4639700"," This yellow line here is a six EMA."
"4640720","4641720"," Normally I'm trip. "
"4641960","4643220"," So this is a way to see something."
"4643360","4644220"," This is a six EMA."
"4644400","4644480"," Right?"
"4644600","4645600"," There's a five minute chart. "
"4645920","4650240"," I want to see the price here four thirty seven ninety six on a one minute chart."
"4650240","4655920"," That represents the white line on the five minute chart."
"4656100","4657440"," So you see this white line right here?"
"4657840","4659320"," This is the one that I'm actually trading. "
"4659600","4664560"," So normally when I'm live stream with you guys, I don't like trading the one minute with you"
"4664560","4667880"," because you guys get scared and you dump your positions."
"4668440","4674060"," We've slowed the stream down for traders so that they can take their time doing this."
"4675000","4678960"," So this is the actual line you should be trading here. "
"4679760","4683540"," This line right here is the line you should be trading on a five minute chart."
"4684200","4688040"," On a one minute chart, the yellow line is the white line."
"4689000","4689720"," Make sense?"
"4690480","4693520"," So let me see if I can put a one minute here. "
"4696520","4697780"," You'll see it right here."
"4699500","4700600"," Right where we are."
"4716330","4717310"," Five minute chart. "
"4719330","4721550"," Always like this white line right here."
"4721590","4723590"," Currently four thirty seven fifty five."
"4723590","4724690"," But we're above it. "
"4724810","4725510"," We remain bullish."
"4726330","4730610"," If we reverse below the white line, we begin to want to get bearish."
"4731370","4731930"," Right?"
"4732070","4732890"," We're buyers above. "
"4733750","4734310"," Sellers below."
"4735210","4736970"," And this area, right?"
"4737170","4737950"," This is a five minute chart."
"4738270","4742690"," In here is kind of the no go zone, right?"
"4743010","4744290"," You're neutral here. "
"4745150","4746450"," No trade in here."
"4748250","4754170"," You're looking for crosses to confirm the move either way."
"4754630","4755070"," One here. "
"4759150","4760470"," I'll show you two examples."
"4775730","4778430"," You're looking for price action to go below."
"4779250","4780730"," You don't ever want to be in here. "
"4780830","4781930"," You don't want to be in this nonsense."
"4783130","4785710"," You're looking for the try to catch a breath to the upside."
"4787230","4788510"," A rejection here. "
"4789550","4789830"," Right?"
"4790030","4791370"," And then bam, bam, bam."
"4791470","4792550"," These are red bars, by the way."
"4793330","4796630"," And in here, you'd enter the trade on confirmation and boom to the downside. "
"4797070","4797610"," You take the money."
"4797690","4799010"," This is where the big money is in here."
"4799370","4801450"," Big, easy, confirmed money. "
"4802290","4803310"," Same thing to the upside."
"4809220","4810280"," Something like that."
"4812180","4813780"," If the red line is up here. "
"4816520","4818720"," The red line crosses over."
"4818940","4822900"," You're looking for price to confirm on this white line and then bam."
"4823580","4824920"," This is where the money trade is. "
"4825160","4828480"," This is where you like high probability winning trade right there."
"4829080","4830520"," You can actually see it back here."
"4839130","4840910"," Maybe some better examples of this. "
"4841070","4841270"," Hold on."
"4844910","4847490"," Give you guys some cool examples of this happening."
"4847730","4848790"," So we'll look at different time frames. "
"4848790","4851950"," And you can kind of guess how long they last, right?"
"4854290","4856850"," Kind of guess how long they last."
"4859450","4861250"," Come down below the bear plane."
"4862070","4863790"," No confirmation of the downside. "
"4864190","4864950"," You guys remember this day?"
"4865110","4866310"," This was the 24th, right?"
"4867330","4869470"," Remember, no confirmation of the downside."
"4870150","4870370"," What happens?"
"4872070","4872670"," We're up and running."
"4872930","4875850"," You would not put that trade on until you got underneath. "
"4877830","4878670"," What do we do?"
"4878830","4883390"," Rocket ship for days and days and days to the upside fueling that huge run to the upside."
"4883790","4885470"," Big moment here, right?"
"4885670","4888030"," I'll show you an example for where it was confirmed to the downside."
"4889830","4890650"," Cross here. "
"4890890","4891110"," Come up."
"4891410","4891490"," Boom."
"4892470","4893710"," Confirmed here to the downside. "
"4895130","4897950"," Trade over once we get above that hourly trigger, right?"
"4898090","4899550"," You should have closed short right there."
"4902550","4903470"," Five minute chart."
"4903730","4904530"," Same stuff, right?"
"4904830","4905490"," Trade and above. "
"4905890","4908010"," Price is above the white line."
"4908030","4910110"," We're going up above the red line going up."
"4910930","4913370"," Price below the white and yellow line. "
"4913470","4914450"," There's the cross right there."
"4914590","4915150"," We're going down."
"4915790","4917530"," Going down, going down, going down. "
"4917770","4920590"," When we cross above, close your short, right?"
"4921330","4923510"," No, nothing telling you what to do here."
"4923790","4924650"," Confirmation of the upside."
"4925110","4925130"," Boom. "
"4925290","4925630"," Take along."
"4926890","4927450"," Riding."
"4929350","4934010"," That's a rock expecting to hold talks on these say harm pipeline on June 19th. "
"4944880","4948720"," Price right now in a five minute chart above the white line on a five minute."
"4950040","4950600"," Bush."
"4951620","4954360"," Until you break below to take the opposite side of the trade. "
"4958530","4960350"," You also know about pivots."
"4960810","4963070"," Hopefully you guys know about pivots, right?"
"4963070","4964410"," We tagged this pivot already."
"4970620","4972160"," What other pivots do we have?"
"4972380","4973860"," We have this pivot right here. "
"4973960","4975140"," This is the pre-market high."
"4975300","4976000"," We already tagged it."
"4976600","4977700"," Let's see it over here. "
"4978560","4978880"," There."
"4979500","4979760"," There."
"4980540","4981260"," Tag this one. "
"4981740","4984200"," Move to the upside until we turn around."
"4985200","4985860"," We are bullish."
"4987340","4990440"," Next thing you always want to consider is time. "
"4992420","4995120"," You want to be watching a clock."
"4996240","4998820"," Some of you traders out there."
"4999980","5003180"," Trade from the hour like 10 to 11. "
"5003900","5005140"," 11 to 12."
"5005580","5006760"," 12 to 1."
"5007080","5008140"," Don't trade like that."
"5008680","5010400"," Trade stock market hours. "
"5011460","5012720"," Cash market hours."
"5013180","5014320"," 9 30 to 10 30."
"5014480","5015640"," 10 30 to 11 30. "
"5015920","5017440"," 11 30 to 12 30."
"5017660","5018680"," 12 30 to 1 30."
"5018920","5019840"," 1 30 to 2 30. "
"5020220","5021780"," All the way to 4 30 in the afternoon."
"5021780","5026560"," Within those hours on the half hour, right?"
"5027160","5031360"," Start to break them up by the 15 minute in your brain you should be able to be or you"
"5031360","5033680"," should be looking for a full hour."
"5034460","5037060"," So let's call it 9 30 to 10 30. "
"5037780","5046000"," And you want to see if the sellers or the buyers are getting new highs or new lows in that"
"5046000","5046900"," hour period."
"5047840","5052280"," So you're like, okay, this 15 minutes the sellers have 15 minutes to get a new low."
"5054020","5055340"," 15 minutes pass, right?"
"5055500","5058560"," You go to your half hour and you're like, okay, they got another 15 minutes to get a new low. "
"5059120","5064360"," And in your brain, you should be thinking about the velocity of the thought process or that thought"
"5064360","5065780"," process, but the strength of these sellers."
"5066620","5070220"," Are they catching new lows every 15 minutes in that hour?"
"5070820","5073540"," How bearish is that hour?"
"5075180","5075740"," Right?"
"5076140","5082060"," If you start to see a pattern where they're catching 15 minute new highs, 15 minute new highs, 15"
"5082060","5082840"," minute new highs."
"5083060","5083940"," That's pretty bullish, right?"
"5085260","5091700"," The next hour we come into in the in the buyers only have three new highs. "
"5091700","5093800"," You know that they're losing their strength, right?"
"5094660","5098720"," You go to the next hour and the buyers only have one new high."
"5099400","5100840"," What is that telling you?"
"5102120","5107160"," It's telling you that the buyers are losing their strength, right?"
"5108120","5110180"," Maybe you start taking some off the table."
"5110940","5116960"," Maybe you start to look for a check lower back on that 27 or 129 EMA. "
"5117800","5119340"," Maybe there's a dip by there."
"5121140","5126660"," If you're in trend day to the upside in every hour at the start of the morning, I just can't"
"5126660","5127820"," believe I'm telling you guys this stuff."
"5131740","5137880"," Every hour, let's say you're getting a new high every 15 minutes and you're three hours into it. "
"5138280","5140140"," All of a sudden you only get two."
"5143120","5146280"," What is that telling you?"
"5149100","5151900"," It's telling you to start looking lower for more support, right?"
"5152860","5155260"," Maybe it's time to start taking some off the table."
"5167340","5168540"," Same thing on the downside. "
"5169520","5171880"," There are some easy ways to look at that as well."
"5172140","5174520"," You can see these lines sometimes are more vertical."
"5175240","5177200"," Sometimes these lines are more horizontal. "
"5178500","5182140"," Sometimes they're vertical the downside that can also show you velocity the up and down side."
"5183440","5187200"," Price is king above and below those lines, aren't they?"
"5195760","5198340"," You can also check that on higher time frames too."
"5200120","5202320"," You can look at an hourly a daily. "
"5203560","5208720"," You can see how many new lows, how many new highs are getting on those time frames."
"5211440","5215680"," That'll tell you the strength of sellers and the strength of buyers."
"5226050","5226750"," Right on. "
"5228030","5232410"," Shouldn't have dropped that stuff, but you know, you're like, Oh, light bulb, got it."
"5235310","5236590"," That's how you make money, huh?"
"5240090","5244230"," So all these people that are on fin to it, trying to be the smartest guy, that doesn't matter, does"
"5244230","5244690"," it?"
"5244690","5245230"," No, it doesn't."
"5247270","5250150"," Smart guys on fin to it have nothing to do with making money. "
"5259490","5294140"," A little"
"5294140","5295680"," bit of liquidity here, leaving the market."
"5300700","5302240"," What a pause right now."
"5304140","5307200"," We're going to rip some faces off and jump up there or what?"
"5310480","5311140"," Let's go. "
"5311760","5313300"," Give me that red bar up there, man."
"5318440","5319340"," Let's go, baby."
"5319580","5320120"," Get on up there. "
"5321940","5323500"," Be really careful up here."
"5323520","5324600"," I want you guys to know something."
"5324860","5325020"," Okay. "
"5325840","5328840"," Like, like Icarus is awarding to you."
"5330700","5334680"," You should have a, you should have a screener at home with NDX on it."
"5334820","5335740"," So you can count the ticks. "
"5337960","5341820"," I mean, we're like nine ticks away from 15,000 here."
"5345360","5346700"," There's a, there's a murder."
"5346980","5348180"," I'll go somewhere up there. "
"5350500","5351300"," He's up there."
"5351440","5352060"," I assure you."
"5353640","5357100"," Some guy with like a broken down 1970s murder. "
"5357360","5361960"," I was like, just schedule it 15,000, 10,000, 5,000."
"5362860","5364100"," It's an auto cell."
"5365620","5366260"," Hey, boss. "
"5366500","5367200"," What if it goes above?"
"5367520","5367980"," Doesn't matter."
"5370620","5372700"," We're running a Commodore 64 here."
"5372800","5374320"," We can only put so many commands in. "
"5383290","5384430"," It's going to get violent."
"5385110","5392610"," It's like this psychological thing."
"5392770","5393430"," You know, not just psychological. "
"5393590","5394670"," You love these funds."
"5394990","5396190"," They trade to big round numbers."
"5397170","5399010"," They fucking love zeros and fives. "
"5401230","5402530"," They fucking love them."
"5408990","5410990"," It was always like that place, right?"
"5411230","5412290"," It was a cool one for you."
"5412350","5413030"," I got a cool one for you. "
"5413370","5415590"," So the other day we're selling the market, right?"
"5417710","5420730"," And here I'll show you guys a cool one from the other day."
"5420890","5421590"," We're streaming, right?"
"5427180","5429100"," And, oh, that's NDLS."
"5429260","5429900"," How about NDX?"
"5430100","5431020"," Can we get NDX?"
"5438990","5439670"," Hold on here. "
"5441010","5442110"," Oh, did we delete it already?"
"5442350","5442990"," Hold on a second here."
"5445450","5446190"," Oh, did we delete?"
"5446330","5448710"," I think maybe it's not showing up on this chart."
"5449890","5451150"," Or maybe I deleted it. "
"5451290","5452450"," Or maybe it's just not showing up."
"5452610","5453490"," Let's see if we can show it here."
"5453730","5453930"," Right here. "
"5453990","5454890"," There it is on that chart."
"5457150","5461610"," So, you know, we're like, when we trade here, right?"
"5463910","5467860"," And we trade here too."
"5468040","5469280"," There's another lesson for you. "
"5473750","5475010"," When we come in here, right?"
"5475190","5476510"," We come into these zones, right?"
"5476910","5477530"," Trade in here."
"5477730","5477990"," Yahoo."
"5478510","5478930"," Trade in here. "
"5479010","5479270"," Yahoo."
"5479390","5479830"," Great trading."
"5481110","5482910"," You don't want to mess around in this stuff here. "
"5483270","5483910"," I don't."
"5484110","5485430"," This is all big volatility, right?"
"5485550","5486250"," You get cut up in here."
"5486870","5488730"," This could as easily have rolled over. "
"5488950","5489530"," I need to be fucked."
"5490410","5493290"," As we've traded this down the other day, we put this orange box in here."
"5493370","5494870"," And I was like, yeah, I don't mess with that. "
"5494870","5497950"," I was like, don't mess with that right there for your sell side."
"5498070","5498730"," I was like, why bother?"
"5499450","5500270"," There's no point."
"5500650","5504890"," Like you wait until it blasts through and confirms the next leg lower. "
"5505730","5505810"," Right?"
"5506010","5506730"," So you're kind of like waiting."
"5507650","5510730"," I mean, this is the area that you take in here."
"5511030","5512410"," This is the area that you take in here. "
"5512750","5515770"," If you're like, sell side, sell side by side doesn't matter."
"5515950","5516870"," You trade the zone, right?"
"5517690","5522690"," If we broke through here and confirmed a rejection to the downside, you jump back in."
"5523450","5524930"," That's where your money is right here. "
"5525450","5527130"," It's where you get cut up right in there."
"5527930","5528730"," Same thing in here."
"5528830","5529910"," You don't fuck around with that stuff. "
"5530490","5535050"," But if you see the move higher and the confirmation move to go higher, hell yeah, jump back in that"
"5535050","5535730"," trade to the upside."
"5536670","5536730"," Right?"
"5536990","5539070"," And we're kind of coming to that zone right now up here."
"5539230","5539970"," Like up in here?"
"5541630","5543390"," No, I'm not going to fuck around with this. "
"5544050","5544490"," You know, like, right?"
"5544630","5545130"," We're up in here."
"5546290","5548130"," You know what I want to fuck around on this?"
"5548790","5550730"," I want to fuck around on this when it does this."
"5550730","5551990"," Like a blast through. "
"5552770","5555270"," And it does a little bit of confirmation to the upside."
"5556070","5556170"," Right?"
"5556410","5558050"," Digest all this crap here."
"5558370","5559550"," It starts to consolidate. "
"5560090","5561330"," That hasn't fallen through."
"5561990","5562330"," Right?"
"5562710","5564710"," We start to make turn to the upside."
"5565490","5565990"," I buy. "
"5567750","5568270"," Right?"
"5568550","5568890"," I buy."
"5569590","5570910"," And I put some stops down here."
"5571910","5572670"," Right there. "
"5573070","5573570"," Boom, some stops."
"5574510","5576350"," If it reverses, I have a stop."
"5576770","5578790"," It's already going in the direction that I want it to. "
"5578790","5581330"," I'm already targeting $14,500."
"5581670","5583710"," You know, I'm in a good spot there."
"5584370","5588450"," A lot of times, though, people are like, a lot of times, people are like, I want to go long"
"5588450","5589590"," right now, right here. "
"5590070","5591970"," And I'm like, dude, that's not the fucking place, dude."
"5592490","5594890"," What if it squeezes up here and pokes his nose up?"
"5594930","5596290"," They're like, well, I'm like, yeah, you can."
"5597190","5599830"," Try running that trade 10, 20 times, though. "
"5600670","5608250"," You're the guy that probably has a job and you trade your paycheck every week."
"5608250","5611230"," You know, and like every month or so, you hit it big."
"5612090","5613330"," You win three in a row. "
"5614430","5616690"," You're like a balling with 30 grand in my pocket."
"5617890","5619350"," And, you know, you're a baller."
"5619790","5622610"," And then you do that trade three, four, five more times and you lose. "
"5623910","5625250"," And you go back to your job."
"5627710","5629550"," And you do it all over again, right?"
"5643350","5645630"," You just hang out here, see what happens here."
"5645790","5647310"," You let all this ball happen in here. "
"5650730","5653490"," We know we're at 15,000 right now."
"5656310","5658950"," We're rechecking the five minute here and here."
"5661390","5662910"," See the checking going on. "
"5664190","5665450"," Checking for the move higher."
"5665770","5666610"," You're like, fuck that cab."
"5666930","5667530"," Check here. "
"5667630","5668990"," It's got another check right there."
"5669730","5670410"," We're going higher."
"5671490","5672570"," So what are we going to do here?"
"5673430","5675190"," We're going to previous high now. "
"5675410","5677110"," We're going to get rid of this, not that high."
"5677110","5678410"," We already took that one out."
"5679070","5682510"," This is now a pivot point, 436, 34. "
"5683270","5684670"," We have a recheck down here."
"5685430","5688450"," And they're going to give the bulls one more chance to get up there."
"5688550","5689350"," What time is it right now?"
"5689770","5690510"," The half hour, right?"
"5690950","5691890"," It's 11 o'clock. "
"5692830","5695630"," Sellers need a new low by 1130."
"5696490","5699230"," Show a reversal down to 437, 16."
"5699830","5702230"," So in the next minute, they didn't get it. "
"5702390","5702670"," Did they?"
"5703030","5706090"," 11 a.m. Sellers on this bar."
"5706090","5708570"," Need to get a new low."
"5709050","5709790"," They have to. "
"5710130","5712870"," To try to come down to 437, 17."
"5713530","5715870"," If they're unsuccessful, they get that new low down there."
"5716610","5716950"," Right?"
"5717150","5718190"," You know what's going to happen, right?"
"5718750","5721650"," We're going to go up here and recheck this 436, 34. "
"5722630","5724010"," Watch this bar right now."
"5724430","5725830"," It's seen at 173."
"5726150","5728330"," You'll see sellers begin to step in. "
"5728350","5729870"," You guys call these liquidation breaks."
"5730010","5732050"," They're not coming down and trying to sell."
"5732350","5734670"," These algorithms trying to sell this fucking bar right here. "
"5735850","5738570"," They're trying to get down here to this 437, 17."
"5738850","5743090"," If they're unsuccessful, we are going to go back up here and check this 436, 34."
"5747210","5748370"," For the next 15 minutes. "
"5755510","5757570"," Yeah, it's really hard for a new trader to do that."
"5757910","5758690"," You get excited."
"5759490","5760710"," Bears do a two-cell side. "
"5760970","5762150"," I mean, I use that as a heel, right?"
"5762330","5763550"," I don't really believe in bulls and bit."
"5763650","5764190"," Well, I don't know."
"5764310","5765450"," We'll talk about that today, too. "
"5765550","5767650"," It's a big conversation with a friend about that, too."
"5768370","5769770"," I don't believe in bulls and bears."
"5770870","5772790"," I believe in buyers and sellers, right?"
"5772990","5773890"," Supply and demand. "
"5775630","5780150"," There are some people out there that say there's no such thing as supply and demand."
"5780370","5780750"," That's fake."
"5783390","5785130"," I respect that opinion, too. "
"5785850","5789590"," But for trading every day, I'm like, hey, there's supply and there's demand."
"5790650","5793510"," When I speak to you guys, I try to simplify things."
"5793510","5800090"," I use bulls and bears as a heel to represent supply and demand. "
"5800950","5804010"," Sometimes you'll also hear me talk about bulls and bears on fintuit."
"5804430","5810570"," Mostly I do that because I'm trying to attract someone that thinks it's bulls and bears so that we"
"5810570","5813210"," can then retrain them to understand what supply and demand is."
"5814290","5821330"," The meaning of it, the strength of supply, the strength of demand, and how to identify it on a"
"5821330","5821990"," chart, right?"
"5833210","5835050"," Where are those levels are?"
"5836230","5839690"," And then also, why not to fight in those places, right?"
"5839870","5841450"," You don't want to fight with an algorithm. "
"5842530","5846650"," You're like a retailer inside of another person's playground, right?"
"5846950","5848610"," Someone with more power than you, a dealer."
"5849810","5851430"," A fund, a bank."
"5852890","5855530"," You don't have a lot of, you don't know what they know, right?"
"5857130","5859670"," You even saw I can get run over recently, right?"
"5859890","5861530"," So even those guys can get run over. "
"5862230","5865710"," So you as a retailer are trying to survive and someone else's playground is not easy."
"5867410","5868950"," So don't ever mess around on that shit."
"5869070","5869710"," There's no need to. "
"5872430","5877470"," And depending on the time frame you're trading, there's no need to."
"5879450","5880530"," Did we get a new low?"
"5880690","5882090"," He missponsored by to the tick."
"5882610","5885170"," Get free daily points, Fibonacci and money. "
"5885170","5886050"," We didn't, did we?"
"5886330","5888950"," By signing up at to the tick.com."
"5891570","5893750"," So I can get you here inside of this live stream."
"5895130","5896350"," To teach you some really simple things."
"5900330","5902250"," Probably become a better trader and make some money. "
"5928470","5932270"," Just taking like a 30 second trade right there and made some fucking money."
"5936540","5938020"," This is a hanging out day, huh?"
"5938880","5944640"," I always feel like on Fed rate decision days, it's like the Harlem Globetrotters."
"5945580","5946880"," Like they get the main event. "
"5947360","5948940"," The main event just today, right?"
"5949220","5953760"," Later on, they get the main event and then all the day traders come out and they're like just doing"
"5953760","5957560"," layups and like dribbling and let's make five cents."
"5957800","5958840"," Let's make another 30 cents."
"5959700","5960940"," You get like the show before. "
"5962860","5963980"," What happens here?"
"5965700","5970380"," And then like the institutions come out and they're like, they got the brooms and they're like, all"
"5970380","5971060"," right, clean up the floor."
"5971200","5972880"," We get the main event coming at two o'clock."
"5972880","5975020"," We're wrapping up boys, sit on the sidelines. "
"5975420","5976460"," We're going to roll this shit over."
"5976900","5980200"," Hedge funds are like, Billy, what are you doing down there?"
"5980300","5983020"," Stop fucking around on the S&P 500 on the ticks."
"5983780","5985400"," We're going to put the heads on for the Fed. "
"5989160","5990960"," So I am flat right here."
"5992280","5997140"," I'm going to stay flat into 2 p.m. We're going to talk about that again at some point."
"5998640","6001160"," Because I think you're going to get rolled here at some point. "
"6003140","6008260"," Fucking dick it around on a Fed day trying to fucking trying to try to win ticks."
"6008660","6012160"," They're going to come in here and they're going to just blast your ass with a hedge."
"6012560","6015160"," Like boom, what up, boom, what up, boom. "
"6015440","6016780"," One of these, they're going to be like slam."
"6018340","6019820"," Now you're trapping your calls."
"6020180","6021640"," We've burnt all the puts for today. "
"6023520","6024340"," That's my take."
"6024340","6026360"," That's how I always look at these Fed days."
"6028200","6035420"," You like the Harlem, like day trading, doing layups, grandma reverse shots and shit like that. "
"6035840","6036780"," Big bad ass."
"6039320","6040240"," Hold on a second."
"6048670","6049750"," See what we got today. "
"6049850","6051610"," We got anything on the economic calendar for today?"
"6053210","6054770"," Okay, today's economic calendar."
"6054770","6063470"," Oh shit, we got a Fed decision on interest rate policy at 2 p.m. Let's put a vertical line"
"6063470","6072170"," right around 2 p.m. Here's where all the magic happens right there."
"6072330","6072410"," Boom. "
"6076110","6078090"," Got another magical moment here."
"6081780","6083580"," Here's your second magical moment."
"6086260","6089740"," Let people know in the chat what you think about these Fed rate decisions. "
"6091880","6094120"," And I'll tell you what my experience has been."
"6096060","6097160"," There was a time."
"6099140","6100000"," Open up the book. "
"6100220","6102180"," The old bull bear fable book over here."
"6102300","6102480"," Hold on."
"6102560","6104680"," We've got the old bull bear fable book. "
"6104840","6104980"," Hold on."
"6108020","6111380"," Should I get the hedge fund market wizards or should I get?"
"6112700","6114560"," The education of a speculator."
"6115260","6116640"," Read a passage out of that. "
"6121480","6121920"," So."
"6123100","6124520"," Last year in 2022."
"6125700","6127220"," It's the first year that I noticed. "
"6128080","6130540"," We had noticed that years and years and years as years passed."
"6130540","6132900"," But last year in 2022, it was the first year I noticed."
"6133600","6136280"," Like the weaponization everybody talks about on zero dates. "
"6136280","6137780"," They were on the put side on the call side."
"6139300","6145100"," The reason I noticed it was because last year in those Fed meetings, I would walk into them and be"
"6145100","6146240"," like, Hey, what's going on in here?"
"6146280","6149360"," And they'd be like 800,000 fucking puts."
"6151020","6153200"," And they were all jacked up in price. "
"6154080","6155480"," And nobody was buying calls."
"6156460","6159260"," They were like two cents for like a 30 delta call."
"6159300","6159700"," And I'm like. "
"6160720","6161580"," This is ridiculous."
"6162200","6163940"," And my friend was talking about this their day too."
"6163980","6164460"," And he was like. "
"6165320","6166720"," You got a dealer over here."
"6166720","6169080"," And he's got, you know, he's got a bucket full of water."
"6170420","6172780"," And they just got another bucket that's empty. "
"6173460","6173720"," Right."
"6175640","6177340"," And the stealer has to like."
"6178540","6180400"," So you get three buys a little bit of a rephrase. "
"6180600","6182060"," You got you got three buckets."
"6182100","6182500"," Okay."
"6184260","6187120"," And one bucket's empty or two buckets are empty. "
"6188020","6191360"," And one bucket is or the dealer's got a full bucket of water."
"6191620","6194400"," I should say that you got a bull with a bucket that's empty and a bear."
"6194400","6195400"," That's a bucket that's empty. "
"6195760","6198000"," If he has to pay off all these fucking bears."
"6199160","6203400"," He has to fucking pour the entire bucket of water into that bucket for the bears."
"6203680","6203760"," Right. "
"6203960","6204700"," They're all full puts."
"6206480","6207360"," The bulls."
"6207980","6210020"," They only need like a splash of water. "
"6210320","6211320"," The dealers can keep the rest."
"6212560","6213680"," So what happened?"
"6213920","6214480"," We committed those meetings."
"6214820","6217220"," They just like splash a little water in the bull bucket. "
"6217520","6218280"," Of course guy like me."
"6218380","6219180"," Be like whoo hoo."
"6219640","6221920"," I just made all this fucking money and everybody just got robbed. "
"6224660","6225180"," Right."
"6226060","6228260"," And now people caught on."
"6228560","6230820"," It's like we did that last year. "
"6230900","6232500"," I think three or four times or something."
"6233020","6233680"," Maybe five."
"6234000","6235140"," We were really hitting the hammer. "
"6235140","6236700"," And then it got worse and worse and worse."
"6237540","6238340"," This year."
"6238780","6239460"," It sucked. "
"6240120","6242960"," Like we came in this year and wack into one of these fed meetings."
"6243280","6244580"," I'm seeing meetings rate."
"6244820","6245640"," It doesn't matter. "
"6246040","6248200"," And the dealers are like fucking both."
"6248200","6249820"," And so now they're like."
"6250200","6253360"," They're like jacking up the price of options for bears and bulls. "
"6253360","6255260"," And they're cleaning both sides out."
"6256640","6258900"," And you got players that know this is happening."
"6259140","6260660"," So they're in there to buy all this shit. "
"6260720","6261780"," They're like I'm going to get the other side."
"6261780","6262740"," I'm going to get the other side."
"6263280","6264540"," This side's lopsided. "
"6264700","6266100"," So you got too many people now too."
"6266160","6266660"," Not just dealers."
"6266880","6268460"," We got a big traders and stuff like that. "
"6268520","6270360"," And you got really smart people out there falling along."
"6271180","6273040"," They're watching all this shit in the background scene."
"6273200","6274000"," We're doing so. "
"6274720","6275260"," Right now."
"6276600","6278060"," Coming into these rate decisions."
"6279280","6280560"," Hasn't been the best trading. "
"6282500","6285920"," And not only that they've been less volatile."
"6286780","6290320"," In general than previous experiences for me."
"6290520","6291900"," You see really volatile moves. "
"6292120","6293340"," They were supposed to get a vault to move."
"6293840","6294740"," They're promising one."
"6294940","6297820"," We're priced for a vault to move to the up and down side. "
"6298920","6303580"," So maybe today you could pause it that a strangle would be in order."
"6305780","6311120"," You've got a target down below here at 4.34. You got a big target up here at 4.31"
"6311120","6312160"," and 3 cents."
"6313060","6314760"," It's a pretty decent strangle here. "
"6315560","6318640"," You could probably manage both sides of this trade."
"6320020","6326480"," The only key point I would say to you would be that managing this trade is the biggest challenge of"
"6326480","6328800"," managing this trade is going to be the repricing of options."
"6329920","6335600"," But in recent history they haven't hit these targets in the initial moves. "
"6336100","6339960"," Like they'll hit like half way and they'll go up half way."
"6341060","6342900"," They don't actually hit them."
"6343280","6345900"," When they come back in here they do this big major consolidation. "
"6347140","6347660"," They reprice."
"6348060","6350960"," Then they'll go down there and you're kind of getting fucked here."
"6351320","6356500"," So if you're going to do strangles sometimes they're like a spread might be better for you. "
"6356600","6357600"," Like a spread strangle."
"6358420","6361060"," That's a week out or something or a few days out."
"6361520","6366000"," So that if you get caught in that repricing it's not going to impact you as much. "
"6366560","6367920"," Spread front strangles are kind of cool."
"6368840","6372980"," If you are going to do a strangle if you've never traded one I would not recommend doing it today."
"6373200","6374060"," Maybe you paper trade it. "
"6374640","6377280"," They can be very stressful to trade."
"6378180","6379860"," Sometimes you only catch one side."
"6380640","6381500"," You're like what do I do now?"
"6381760","6382560"," You close that side. "
"6383180","6385540"," You let the other side print or die."
"6386920","6388120"," It's a free trade, right?"
"6388440","6392680"," But you also need in the first leg of that trade to pay for that other leg, right?"
"6392880","6394060"," You're going to get that other leg paid for."
"6394560","6395860"," So you're at least flat on the day. "
"6397800","6402840"," There's another idea here that you will close the other side even if it's at a loss because that"
"6402840","6404780"," will be more gained for the winning side of that leg."
"6404960","6410300"," So there's a lot of mechanics to it and there's a lot of emotions in managing a strangle."
"6418990","6424290"," Okay, so if that's beyond your comprehension it's a good day for you if you don't understand this"
"6424290","6428210"," stuff to sit behind and just watch or paper trade like a strangle. "
"6428690","6432370"," It's another good day for you to paper trade a strangle."
"6432570","6434790"," You can go to like unusual wheels I think says paper trading."
"6435630","6438710"," I think you can just sign up their website and do some paper trading or just look up like I"
"6438710","6443250"," don't know free paper trading somewhere and you can paper trade there. "
"6443250","6446210"," Try to set that up before two o'clock that's a fun exercise."

"7719550","7725970"," And you know you have to be able to trade bull sides and you know I'm that way too but"

"18878400","18880340"," This red line right here, okay?"
"18880620","18884500"," What they're going to try to do right now is you're going to try to sell it down and you"
"18884500","18885180"," want to know that."
"18885320","18887640"," So, I'll warn you guys of something here. "
"18887740","18891720"," So right now, this is a two-trigger cluster right here."
"18891840","18893640"," There's a green bar here."
"18893780","18894400"," You can't see it. "
"18895000","18896760"," You're coming up here right now, right?"
"18896980","18898680"," They're going to try to sell it down on you."
"18898680","18901180"," They're going to push it up and then they're going to come right back down here."
"18902020","18911700"," Now, if price gets above this cluster here and this white line captures it, this holds here. "
"18912200","18914020"," Watch out to the upside, okay?"
"18914220","18916340"," Because this will be a major move to the upside right here."
"18916400","18917380"," We'll pay attention to that."
"18917380","18919160"," We said there were three issues. "
"18919160","18920960"," We're going to keep our eyes on that as it develops."

"18925560","18926620"," To which rates would need to go. "
"18927100","18929900"," And then in a period of time over which we'd need to keep policy restrictive."
"18930460","18933180"," So at the end this can get really fast to the upside."
"18933800","18936320"," So sellers need to hold this right here, okay?"
"18937000","18942240"," If sellers can't hold this, to see right here, sellers must hold this. "
"18943000","18944980"," We're going to come up here and smash into it."
"18946180","18947800"," They're going to grind this."
"18948180","18951720"," If buyers get above here, you have to close. "
"18952020","18953540"," This will be explosive to the upside."
"18953960","18955120"," One, two, three trigger cluster."
"18955920","18960380"," I think it reverses and goes to the downside personally, but you have to pay attention to this"
"18960380","18960840"," right here. "
"18961160","18965940"," If you get the signal, if you're looking for the next short, how do you enter the next short?"
"18967260","18973280"," You're looking for determining the extent of additional policy forming that may be appropriate to"
"18973280","18975080"," return inflation to 2% over time."
"18975940","18981280"," So the pace of the increases and the ultimate level of increases are separate variables, given how"
"18981280","18982300"," far it is."
"18982340","18984100"," You want to see this rejection right here. "
"18984300","18988040"," If you don't get that rejection, they're going to squeeze out every seller here."
"18988160","18988800"," I promise you."
"18989760","18993180"," The committee decision made today was only about this meeting. "
"18993520","18996320"," We did last chance for sellers to stay in charge."
"18996760","18998300"," If they don't, right?"
"18998620","19002680"," If we squeeze higher here, decide or really discuss anything about it."
"19002680","19004300"," We start squeezing higher here. "
"19004780","19009440"," We'll come back down and check this, and this will be a signal to go long right there."
"19009820","19011560"," It'll go fucking bananas."
"19011960","19013900"," It'll go right up to 441. "
"19015100","19017860"," Initial support at this stage for that move."
"19018060","19020120"," Sellers need to like pound down here."
"19020300","19026260"," Pound down and pound down in the meeting from time to time, but really the focus was on what to"
"19026260","19026580"," do today. "
"19026820","19029200"," I would say about July 2 things."
"19029360","19031300"," One, decision has been made to."
"19031620","19033620"," I do expect that it will be a live meeting. "
"19034960","19036560"," Is it free trade for you?"
"19036740","19037180"," You're welcome."
"19040080","19045600"," I was just wondering if you could help us understand the narrative here, because it feels like"
"19045600","19048400"," there's been a level shift in the dots."
"19049520","19057760"," Stronger G, less of a hit to unemployment, slower progress on inflation, and I'm wondering where's"
"19057760","19059240"," the disinflation coming from?"
"19060000","19061500"," The labor market's going to be stronger. "
"19061800","19063280"," It looks like it's not coming from there."
"19064000","19066780"," Demand is not coming down all that fast according to GDP."
"19067100","19068640"," You've doubled your estimate of GDP. "
"19069020","19070260"," What's the narrative here?"
"19070640","19074340"," When I draw these things out for you guys, they're normally right."
"19074660","19076820"," Not always, but like 90% of the time."
"19077100","19081280"," If I draw them in advance, I'll take this as a win right here. "
"19081500","19083400"," So here's a key point for you."
"19083400","19085300"," So where we are right now, right?"
"19085640","19088060"," On the up trade, you would take profit here."
"19088240","19089200"," So you take profit here. "
"19089640","19092380"," You do nothing right here."
"19092480","19093460"," You do nothing in here."
"19093540","19094180"," You do zero. "
"19094720","19095940"," No trade for you."
"19096240","19101000"," If you get the confirmation of the downside, you take this trade right here."
"19101520","19104440"," If we blast up, you don't take that trade. "
"19104980","19106900"," You take this part of the trade right here."
"19107060","19108380"," You know what I'm saying?"
"19109040","19110780"," So you close this trade here."
"19111420","19112660"," You guys want a learning experiment?"
"19113020","19113880"," You guys want a learning lesson?"
"19115100","19116480"," This is your long trade. "
"19117420","19118320"," You get out of it."
"19118620","19120820"," You don't do anything here."
"19121040","19124220"," You wait for the decision of direction. "
"19125300","19131220"," Here to here, you're going to get either an explosive move up or you're going to get a rejection"
"19131220","19131760"," candle."
"19132060","19132780"," When it takes some time."
"19133540","19137260"," And I think you go back to the downside, right?"
"19137260","19139640"," If you see inflation, which is boom, you go down. "
"19140020","19140680"," Does that make sense?"
"19141580","19148120"," Go to the green one here and show you both of the continued healing dam right there."
"19148320","19151620"," You would start along here, start your next short right there."
"19151760","19152960"," You do nothing in here. "
"19153460","19155280"," You got no business in here."
"19155960","19158680"," That's one thing and that should enable goods prices to continue."
"19159160","19162160"," Goods inflation to continue to come down over time. "
"19162880","19166960"," In terms of housing services inflation, that's another big piece."
"19167440","19174220"," And you are seeing there that new rents, new leases are coming in at low levels and it's really a"
"19174220","19176500"," matter of time as that goes through the pipeline."
"19176580","19181860"," In fact, I think any forecast that people are making right now about inflation coming down this"
"19181860","19189420"," year will contain a big dose of this year and next year will contain a good amount of disinflation"
"19189420","19190220"," from that source. "
"19190540","19193800"," And that's, again, probably going to become slower than we would affect."
"19194440","19200320"," That leaves the big sector, which is a little more than half, pardon me, of the core PC inflation."
"19200460","19201760"," That's not housing services. "
"19202180","19207500"," If you're a bull and you're looking for a trade here, you are waiting for confirmation here."
"19208580","19210900"," One, two, three, four."
"19212620","19214020"," Take the trade right there. "
"19215420","19216900"," It's heavily labor intensive."
"19217800","19220660"," This right here is where you get trapped."
"19221260","19224660"," That's the bull trap right there. "
"19228500","19233460"," You have to see confirmation that you're going higher."
"19234020","19240200"," I would almost say that the conditions that we need to see in place to get inflation down are"
"19240200","19244880"," coming into place and that would be growth meaningfully below trend."
"19245480","19247240"," It would be a labor market that's loosening. "
"19247400","19251540"," It would be good pipelines getting healthier and healthier and that kind of thing."
"19251900","19255500"," Trust me, run that trade like 20 times."
"19255680","19256400"," It works every time. "
"19256600","19258600"," Actually, working on inflation is going to take some time."
"19260980","19261420"," No."
"19268520","19269920"," Nick Temeros of the Wall Street Journal. "
"19270440","19270840"," Turpout."
"19271140","19275880"," Nick Temeros, bull's best friend."
"19275880","19276560"," Just hiking now. "
"19276660","19279900"," Not to be flippant but I don't lose weight just by buying a gym membership."
"19280180","19281240"," I have to actually go to the gym."
"19281660","19285760"," 16 of your colleagues put down a higher year end 23 rate today. "
"19286060","19289620"," A majority of you think you're going to have to go up by 50 basis points this year."
"19290160","19293800"," So why not just rip off the band aid and raise rates today?"
"19294460","19295320"," Nicky Leaks."
"19295660","19301880"," First I would say that the question of speed is a separate question from the question from that of"
"19301880","19302120"," level. "
"19303500","19310840"," I think if you look at the S.E.P. It's really accumulation of our individual estimates of how far"
"19310840","19311080"," to go."
"19311260","19313160"," I mentioned how we got to those numbers."
"19313680","19318300"," In terms of speed, it's what I said at the beginning which is speed was very important last year. "
"19318680","19323160"," As we get closer and closer to the destination and according to the S.E.P. we're not so far"
"19323160","19325820"," away from the destination in most people's accounting."
"19326920","19327780"," It's reasonable."
"19328060","19333020"," It's common sense to go a little slower just as it was reasonable to go from 75 basis points to"
"19333020","19335180"," 50 to 25 at every meeting. "
"19335900","19340040"," And so the committee thought overall that you better do it sellers."
"19340460","19343420"," If you lose control of this we're going to rip some faces off."
"19343780","19345080"," And there are benefits to that. "
"19345220","19347320"," So that gives us more information to make decisions."
"19347600","19348760"," We may try to make better."
"19348820","19350540"," I'm going to get ready to buy some calls here. "
"19350700","19355660"," Economy a little more time to adapt as we as we make our decisions going forward."

"19364120","19366800"," It would be early to see those but we don't know what the extent is. "
"19366900","19368220"," We'll have some more time to see that unfolding."
"19368640","19371600"," It's just the idea that we're trying to get this right."
"19373060","19378840"," And this is if you think of the two things as separate variables then I think that the skip, I"
"19378840","19383080"," shouldn't call it the decision makes sense. "

"19414380","19420500"," Since we chose to maintain rates at this meeting it'll really be a three month period of data that"
"19420500","19421040"," we can look at."
"19421140","19425360"," I think that's a full quarter and I think you can draw more conclusions from that than you come"

"19427440","19428160"," We'll look at those things."

"19445540","19450900"," You obviously in your forecast marked up the sort of path for growth, marked down the path for"
"19450900","19454500"," unemployment, marked up the path for inflation pretty notably."
"19455320","19460040"," I wonder since March what has changed to make you think that the economy is a lot more resilient"
"19460040","19466060"," and inflation is going to be a lot more stubborn and given that you know why do you feel confident"
"19466060","19469600"," that this is as high as you're going to have to revise the federal funds rate or do you think"
"19469600","19474740"," it's possible we could have even a higher than 5.6% terminal by the end of this cycle?"
"19475600","19481200"," You know I mean on the first part I just think we're following the data and also the outlook."
"19481580","19484240"," The economy is the labor market I think has surprised. "
"19484320","19485620"," He's not angry right now."
"19485740","19486540"," I like seeing that."
"19486740","19495580"," Over the last couple of years with its extraordinary resilience really and it's just remarkable and"
"19495580","19501280"," that's really if you think about it that's what's driving its job creation it's wages moving up,"
"19501620","19504620"," it's supporting spending which in turn is supporting. "

"19522720","19527800"," a three trigger cluster on the hourly here you have the one minute and the five minute turning"
"19527800","19532380"," against you be very careful here for an explosive move to the upside."
"19532680","19538960"," There's really no way to know but it's it's what people think as of today and as a data come"
"19538960","19543820"," in it can move around during the intermittent period it could wind up back in the same place but it"
"19543820","19545220"," really will be data driven."
"19545440","19550960"," I can't tell you that that I ever have a lot of confidence that we can see where the federal"

"19560660","19563000"," You had long 438 C's."
"19563240","19565500"," We're getting closer to being into balance. "
"19566460","19571400"," Is that still the case or has your mind changed about the balance of risk out there and also could"
"19571400","19576840"," you give us an idea of what would be a sufficiently restrictive funds rate is the obviously the"
"19576840","19579660"," current rate according to the committee is not sufficiently restrictive."
"19580300","19581260"," Is it five six?"
"19581500","19582960"," Is it six words or sufficiently restrictive?"
"19583180","19583460"," Thank you."
"19584400","19591380"," You know I would say again that I think that over time the balance of risks as we move from"
"19591380","19597120"," very you know from interest rates that effectively zero now to five percentage points with with an"
"19597120","19598880"," SCP calling for additional hikes. "
"19598880","19606080"," I think we've moved much closer to our destination which is that sufficiently restrictive rate and"
"19606080","19613420"," I think that means by almost by definition that the risks of sort of overdoing and under doing it"
"19613420","19615500"," are getting closer to being in balance."
"19616060","19622340"," I still think and my colleagues agree that the risks to inflation are to the upside still so we"
"19622340","19626480"," don't we don't think we're there with inflation yet because we're just looking at the data and if"
"19626480","19632280"," you look at the at the full range of inflation data particularly the core data you just you just"
"19632280","19635980"," aren't seeing a lot of progress over the last year headline of course inflation has come down"
"19635980","19640920"," materially but as you know we look at core as a better indicator of where inflation overall is"
"19640920","19641160"," going."
"19641840","19646000"," Yeah they need to get above they need to get above the rate of inflation man in my view they"
"19646000","19648960"," have to they have to get above the rate of inflation it's going to be insane. "
"19650680","19658120"," That's that's what we want to see of course that's what we want to see and I think it's also"
"19658120","19662940"," we understand that there are lags but remember that it's it's more than a year since financial"
"19662940","19667080"," conditions began tightening I think it's I think the reason just tell them you have to get above"
"19667080","19671380"," the rate of inflation it's all you have to tell them man tightening took place over the last summer"
"19671380","19676300"," and later into the year and I think it's it's reasonable to think that some of that may come into"
"19676300","19681340"," effect so we're you know I think stretching out the into a more moderate pace is appropriate to"
"19681340","19693580"," allow you to Rachel Hi"
"19693580","19697740"," Trappell, Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post thanks for taking your questions I wanted to ask"
"19697740","19704200"," further on the lag effects when you're considering when you would hike again throughout the course"
"19704200","19709980"," of the year are there things that you would expect to kick in as those lag effects come come into"
"19709980","19713480"," effect that would inform your decision so if you learned things over the past year that give you"
"19713480","19721160"," some sense of timeline for when to expect those lags to come into effect yeah so it's a it's a"
"19721160","19727620"," challenging thing in economics it's sort of standard thinking that monetary policy affects economic"
"19727620","19733140"," activity with long and variable legs of course these days financial conditions begin to tighten"
"19733140","19738700"," well in advance of actual rate hikes so if you look back when we were lifting off we started"
"19738700","19743140"," talking about lifting off by the time we had lifted off the two year which is a pretty good"
"19743140","19748240"," estimate of where the policy is going had gone from 20 basis points to 200 basis points so in that"
"19748240","19754440"," sense tightening happens much sooner than it used to in a world where where news was in newspapers"
"19754440","19761060"," and not you know not on the wire so that's that's different but it's still the case what you see"
"19761060","19765860"," is interest sensitive spending is affected very very quickly so housing and durable goods and"
"19765860","19772100"," things like that but broader demand and spending and asset values and things like that they just"
"19772100","19778180"," take longer and you can pretty much find research to support whatever answer you would like on that"
"19778180","19785920"," so there's not any certainty or agreement in the profession on how long it takes so you know it"
"19785920","19790820"," then that makes it challenging of course so he's still on soft landing he's still on right now like"
"19790820","19797360"," pause and slowly raise rates over time to catch up with the rate of inflation it seems here and"
"19797360","19798040"," what he's being told."
"19799700","19807040"," he's actually kind of bullish is good I'm impressed it's not really a pause he's trying to talk"
"19807040","19812420"," down that we're paused for good right now he's trying to tell you that he's going to pause for the"
"19812420","19816280"," summer and then he's going to look at it in the future data dependent whatever you want to call it"
"19816280","19822280"," he's trying to talk down saying that we're not going to pause that Institute QE wants to break some"
"19822280","19828440"," shit that he wants to see what everything is I'm with Jay Powell on this keep raising rates baby I"
"19828440","19833560"," think incidents from March and how you're teasing that out apart from these log effects so it's too"
"19833560","19839300"," early still to he did to assess the full extent of what that might mean and you know that's"
"19839300","19845040"," something we're going to be watching of course and you know if we were to see what what we would"
"19845040","19851440"," view as significant tightening beyond what would normally be expected because of this channel then"
"19851440","19858240"," you know we would factor that into account on in making rate decisions so that's I got to say man"
"19858240","19866120"," if you're a bull you're lucky right now thanks even with the pause it's even with the pause he's"
"19866120","19870980"," doing some good language here for bulls that were actually not paused housing has come in pretty"
"19870980","19876100"," low in the past couple of months and as you noted a significant portion of core inflation is now"
"19876100","19880800"," housing prices and he's doing a good job I'm going to give it to him right now man I'm going"
"19880800","19886160"," to give it to him he was able to answer to the pause he's hawkish in his language he's going"
"19886160","19891820"," to continue to raise rates in the future dude he's a baller man he's a fucking baller I love Jerome"
"19891820","19899840"," even more time or it's surprising to see so much hawkishness in the dots given over seeing recently"
"19899840","19906960"," yeah so you know we remember we were two and a half years into this or two and a quarter"
"19906960","19913800"," years into this and forecasters including fed forecasters have consistent he's trying to pass off a"
"19913800","19918980"," pause right now and tell you that you're going to keep getting rates if he told you permanent pause"
"19918980","19925800"," they would rug pull your ass so hard you'd be fucked I think if you look at the you'd be"
"19925800","19930140"," so you'd be in so much trouble it wouldn't even be funny look at it over the last six months"
"19930140","19939320"," you'd be like straight bars to hell hello 350 my old friend our target and not really you know"
"19939320","19944000"," moving down we want to see it moving down decisively that's all we are you know of course we are"
"19944000","19949100"," going to get inflation down to 2% over time we don't want to do we want to do that"
"19949100","19953820"," with the minimum damage we can to the economy of course but we have to get inflation down to 2 "
"19953820","19960280","% and we will and we just don't see that yet so hence you see today's policy decision both both"
"19960280","19964860"," to write down for the rate just a warning to if you're in sell side we have a one minute"
"19964860","19972880"," five minute and one hour trigger price is above all three in this consolidation you're likely going"
"19972880","19982360"," to see a rip up if you see a break below 436.04 you might still be alive so 446 "
"19982360","19986900",".04 sellers need to get under there right now to stay alive."
"19987240","19993040"," And the need for softening can you give us a little more specifically of how you see the tight"
"19993040","19999100"," labor market driving inflation sellers are here man they're trying their best right now very"
"19999100","20004960"," volatile we are right now on any particular paper but I would say that the I think the overall"
"20004960","20011280"," picture is that at the beginning in you know early 2000 and 21 inflation was really becoming from"
"20011280","20018280"," very strong demand for largely for goods people were still at home they had money in the bank and"
"20018280","20022240"," they wanted to spend they spent a lot on goods and of course at the same time and because of"
"20022240","20026620"," that high demand to some extent supply chains got all snarled up so prices went way up inflation"
"20026620","20033000"," went way up that was the origin it wasn't really particularly about the labor market or wages but"
"20033000","20041480"," as you as you moved into through 21 into 22 and now in 23 I think many many analysts believe"
"20041480","20047600"," that it will be important an important part of getting inflation down especially in the non housing"
"20047600","20053620"," services sector into getting wage inflation back to a level that is sustainable that is consistent"
"20053620","20059780"," with 2% inflation we actually have seen wages broadly moved down but just at a quite gradual pace"
"20059780","20065820"," so and that's you know that's that's not true that's a lie right there he just lied to you wages"
"20065820","20071740"," are through the roof right now I assure you they are through the roof with some with what I would"
"20071740","20080640"," think Mike Mike I'm a key member maybe I'm wrong on that there's there's probably some of that"
"20080640","20085880"," there's probably some of that in corporate America most of my friends that are hiring people for"
"20085880","20093040"," high-profile jobs the wages have gone to the roof it would take a while to bring inflation down you"
"20093040","20098240"," reiterated that again today and that we would get to a point where inflation could be sticky so I'm"
"20098240","20104060"," wondering as we go into the next meetings how Wall Street or others should look at your reaction"
"20104060","20110660"," function what will you be reacting to time or data in other words if nothing much changes if we're"
"20110660","20116840"," looking at the same sort of labor market the same sort of inflation levels in July or in September"
"20117560","20123780"," or November will you move because you've said you feel you need to is a time that's going to"
"20123780","20130640"," require additional movement or would it be reversal in inflation so I don't want to deal with with"
"20130640","20136140"," hypotheticals about different ways to say time you know we of course we're not we don't go out of"
"20136140","20140740"," our way to surprise markets or the public at the same time our main focus has to be on getting"
"20140740","20144980"," the policy right and that's that's what we're doing here and that's what we'll do for the upcoming"
"20144980","20151420"," meetings I will say the July meeting will be live and we'll just have to see I think you'll you'll"
"20151420","20156060"," see the data you'll hear fed people talking about it and markets will have to make a make a"
"20156060","20162560"," judgment what do you think inflation is likely to continue coming down based on the lags and based"
"20162560","20167200"," on your threat of additional movement or are we going to be in a period where we're not going to"
"20167200","20175380"," know what's happening you know I think if you look at if you just look at I'll just point you"
"20175380","20180960"," to the forecast so inflation is running core PCE inflation is running at about four and a half"
"20180960","20186700"," little higher than four and a half percent and the median FOMC participants will go down to 3.9 on"
"20186700","20191280"," a 12 months basis this is by the end of this year so that's expecting pretty substantial progress"
"20192000","20197800"," that's that's a pretty significant decline for half a year so that that's the that's the for now I"
"20197800","20201200"," want to make a comment here it's kind of fascinating if you think about it right if you if we"
"20201200","20207080"," can get inflation down between now and 2024 that would make a market roll and that's where like"
"20207080","20216960"," beginning of 2024 or something like that Victoria Guido with Politico could you talk"
"20216960","20222240"," about the balance sheet and how you're thinking about it what would what yeah I got some zero date"
"20222240","20226020"," calls here I'm looking to see if we can get a print on these reserve scarcity and his treasury"
"20226020","20231500"," issuance going to effect this probably put a snap a line up here considering lowering the RRP rate"
"20231500","20236840"," in order to take some pressure off banks so let me say first of all on the treasury part of"
"20236840","20242840"," that scene of the crime right here go back to the balance sheet so on that of course we've been"
"20242840","20246440"," very focused on that for a couple of months as everyone has treasury has laid out its borrowing"
"20246440","20252400"," borrowing plans publicly I think we all saw I saw the secretary's comments yesterday to the effect"
"20252400","20257200"," that treasury has careful of this right here return to the scene the crime roll back over market"
"20257200","20262120"," disruption and that they are going to watch carefully for that so that's that's from the treasury"
"20262120","20267820"," which actually sets the you know the the the borrowings at the Fed we'll be monitoring market"
"20267820","20272780"," conditions carefully as the treasury refills the the TGA I don't even know if you get up that high"
"20272780","20279480"," it's very likely to involve both the reduction in the RRP facility and also in reserves it's very"
"20279480","20287020"," hard to say at the be at the beginning of this which will be which will be greater we are"
"20287020","20294180"," starting at a very high level of reserves and still elevated RRP to take up for that matter so we"
"20294180","20299340"," don't think reserves are likely to become scarce in the near term or even over the course of the"
"20299340","20305680"," year so that's that's careful of this cross right here when you see this you've got this major"
"20305680","20312080"," cross coming up to monitor conditions in money markets and we're prepared to make adjustments to"
"20312080","20318940"," make sure that that monetary policy transmission works was there another part of your question yeah"
"20318940","20325020"," what are you considering lowering the RRP rate to help take some pressure off banks so we have a"
"20325020","20331120"," number of I would say the RRP doesn't look like it's it's pulling money out of the banking system"
"20331120","20336940"," it's actually been shrinking here lately so I don't think that's not something something we've"
"20336940","20342620"," thought about a lot over time it doesn't really look like that's that's something that we would do"
"20342620","20347220"," I think it's I think it's a tool that we have if we want to use it we can there"
"20347220","20352620"," are other tools we can we can use to address money market issues but I wouldn't say that that's so"
"20352620","20362760"," close your shorts Janelle Marte with Bloomberg Have"
"20362760","20367980"," you seen sufficient cooling in the housing market to bring inflation down for example how does the"
"20367980","20373980"," recent rebound affect your forecast and do you need if you're selling right now you need like a"
"20373980","20382060"," hedge fund to commit and just hammer down like two billion dollars in spy S&P Fucking ES whatever"
"20382060","20387740"," you want to do sell it all sell some ES sell some SBX sell some fucking spy sell it all"
"20387740","20395260"," we now see housing putting in a bottom and maybe even moving up a little bit you know we're"
"20395260","20403020"," watching that situation carefully I do think we will see rents rents and house prices filtering"
"20403020","20412680"," into into housing services inflation and I don't know joy for sellers right now no joy kind of"
"20412680","20419140"," wandering around at a relatively low level now and that's appropriate do you think you'll have to"
"20419140","20424640"," target with further rate increases well I think we look at everything we don't just look at housing"
"20424640","20430200"," so I think you know the way it works is individual participants sit in their offices all over the"
