"10390","15250"," leader is provided to permit the projectionist to complete adjustment of focus and sound level"
"15250","17010"," before the film begins."
"111490","113410"," Just a couple of seconds there, good morning."
"114010","115110"," Having some issues this morning. "
"116470","123070"," Came into my office and I had a large glass of water."
"124070","125430"," Gotta be a hydro homey."
"126830","129030"," I guess and drink water every day. "
"129650","133070"," Giant glass like one like this right here."
"134130","135990"," One of my children's water cups."
"137190","145550"," I drink water out of every morning and I wound up knocking it over on a monitor. "
"146470","150470"," I've got some really like janky old monitor."
"151870","156130"," Hooked up right now in the moment I implogged it and hooked up a new monitor."
"156250","166170"," It like stream labs imploded on itself, muted all of my mics, muted all the sound inputs, changed"
"166170","169250"," all my display settings on every display. "
"170030","176450"," And it changed it like the settings on the display and then actually the output to or the input and"
"176450","177810"," output on stream lab."
"178050","179290"," So it was pretty fucking brutal."
"179510","182470"," But whatever, we'll get it started here. "
"183590","184990"," Let's go right into the mainstream."
"185450","190340"," If I have any issues this morning, just bear with me."
"191040","194180"," So we've got two price targets here on the opening bell. "
"194400","199520"," I'll change this to red or white so you can see it above."
"199820","202560"," We're squeezing higher and we should continue to squeeze higher this morning."
"203180","204800"," Now trading 40236. "
"205940","208480"," Haven't changed this one right here and just see if I can."
"209840","214640"," Yeah, I'm having some really fucking display setting stuff this morning."
"215000","216600"," So on my end, it's hard for me to see. "
"219380","221920"," I got some really wonky shit going on here."
"224270","227270"," You can actually see that black bar over here on the right hand side."
"227990","234790"," I'm having some real wonkiness on my displays this morning and fixing them is not helping. "
"237090","237790"," There it goes."
"237970","239190"," There's another reset right there."
"240030","241250"," It looks a little bit better. "
"241950","243710"," It's kind of brutal to look at right now."
"245630","247710"," Having some issues this morning."
"248290","252090"," So above, you'll see PT2 is up here at four. "
"252330","255110"," I think it's 41080 or something like that."
"257790","261710"," We traded right to the first bar here, sat right out of the one minute in the five minute."
"261850","264390"," The next target above is I believe it's 41080. "
"264810","267370"," We'll take a look at it here this morning in just a moment."
"271860","273760"," See if I can give me a second here."
"279530","280590"," Yeah, it's really weird. "
"280770","282590"," I'm having real issues this morning."
"282830","283550"," I don't know why."
"286430","287110"," There we go. "
"287190","287710"," I can see here."
"287830","288510"," I can start to see."
"289090","291010"," And I've got some issues in the back end here seeing. "
"291370","298230"," All right, now I can see your chat now."
"298570","299890"," Okay, so I can see your chat now."
"303640","306240"," So good morning to all of you out there that are tuning in at the moment. "
"306440","310120"," I apologize for having some technical difficulties on my end."
"310120","312120"," I had if you're just joining us."
"312860","316500"," I had a cup of water that I so I have I've got so behind. "
"316680","318980"," You can't see this, but I've got some expense."
"319100","323560"," Very expensive, very thin monitors."
"323860","325680"," They're like a quarter inch thick. "
"326920","332380"," And I have one that sits down below as a monitor for streamlabs and I've knocked a bottle or not"
"332380","335140"," a bottle of a cup of water just like this on it."
"335140","337100"," One of my kids water cups."
"337340","339860"," This I drink my water out of every morning. "
"339860","340960"," Anyways, rolled over."
"341900","348480"," Got some water on some micro USBs or micro HDMI's and stuff like that."
"349380","353060"," And it it caused havoc wreaked havoc this morning. "
"353880","359900"," So I had to hook up an old piece of shit monitor and I had to raise up another monitor"
"359900","363000"," behind it and then I had display issues with streamlabs."
"364060","365200"," That's a good morning to all of you."
"365280","366340"," Yeah, stop drinking for every night. "
"366460","368760"," I am been stone cold sober too."
"370560","374140"," Stone cold sober just trading back just checking this one minute right now."
"374900","376960"," I'll be getting some stuff to look at this morning for sure. "
"378260","383820"," We'll take a look at we'll take a look this morning at the triggers and see we're at on those."
"385980","389880"," The one in five minute or rolling over a little bit here a little bit a week in the one"
"389880","395480"," in five minute, but the hourly in the dailies are monster strong right now super strong."
"395900","399480"," The hourly keeps looking like it wants to roll over, but it doesn't. "
"399540","402240"," It just keeps doing its thing at this point."
"403020","407680"," And I have nothing less than to suspect that we even squeeze higher from here."
"407760","410660"," We'll see if we do or we don't, but I've got no interest. "
"410900","413520"," So at this point this morning, I've got no position in the market."
"413520","421660"," This could, in my view, this could as easily send itself down 70 points in five minutes."
"422300","424720"," Now, so I'm just not willing to risk the money on this trade here. "
"425440","427860"," I'm flat at the moment right now in the market."
"428660","429840"," So just give me a second here."
"431380","432620"," And we'll go over everything. "
"432840","433300"," It's kind of weird."
"433560","436060"," It's kind of wonky and weird to look at all this stuff right now."
"436060","440840"," Now, there is a large concentration of calls on 406C. "
"441200","445420"," They're $1.52. I think they started at 80 cents or something on the opening bell this morning."
"445940","447900"," They went right in and bought them right off that bell."
"449520","454820"," I think they might have started with some puts right in the open, but at this point they're still"
"454820","455020"," long. "
"455200","464680"," They're holding 160,000 calls right now in the money at 406C for $1.54. And we'll take a look."
"465520","468140"," Let me see if I can switch this over real quick and show you guys."
"470640","473760"," I'll show you guys some where we're at this morning. "
"474940","477260"," I'm going to mute this book map in the background."
"479880","481480"," I'll show you everything this morning."
"482020","487520"," Now, where's part about this monitor is the one that I have for streamlabs now at this moment is I"
"487520","488800"," can't see anything. "
"488800","490440"," The way the displays have already set."
"490500","491400"," It's all really wonky."
"491800","494220"," So the daily is getting very bullish here, right?"
"494340","496780"," This is extreme bullishness on the daily. "
"497040","502200"," The hourly just keeps or if you watch the velocity, hourly velocity is just maxing out right now."
"502600","505660"," Five minutes weakening a little bit and the one minute's weakening a little bit."
"506360","512520"," So you can look at the velocity this morning, but huge bullishness in the market squeezing straight"
"512520","513880"," up on the open this morning. "
"514460","516020"," No stops left behind."
"516760","519640"," And the last of those stops are up here around."
"520260","525520"," We'll take a look at it somewhere up here around 41080, I believe. "
"526040","529240"," I was trying to take a look at where it was right up here on 41080."
"529560","534260"," And you're also watching the hourly trigger come together with the daily trigger."
"534620","537860"," And this is going to be a very powerful place down below here. "
"538320","540680"," So I had said this morning that I have no interest here."
"541020","546540"," I really want to see this pullback at some point, whether it's here right now."
"547620","553640"," Now, whether we get that pullback here and some consolidation, wait for that five and one minute to"
"553640","555800"," come back down here and get this explosive move. "
"556620","558360"," Or we just squeeze straight up."
"558480","564940"," It's possible that we squeeze entirely up to 41080 and then we get the rollover down below."
"565420","570000"," So looking at this right here, you could actually squeeze this straight up and then get that sell"
"570000","574180"," down and watch the one in five minute come back down for a dip by down below. "
"574340","579080"," But I wouldn't put it past as far as long as we stay above the one in five minute, the"
"579080","580320"," long trade is still on."
"580960","586780"," And as of right now, you can see we are trading above that one in five minute."
"586900","592420"," There's no reason at this point not to believe the bulls here that they are completely in charge. "
"593100","595580"," And they have no issues here trading this."
"596020","602520"," So currently, if you are long in the market, as long as currently if you hold 405 97, there's"
"602520","604140"," nothing you have to worry about at this point."
"604320","609740"," So 405 93, I guess, 97 somewhere in there as long as that's held. "
"610400","611920"," Bull trend is still on."
"612700","613820"," So we'll bring this."
"614060","622400"," We'll take a look here. "
"622400","623800"," And hold this."
"623940","628820"," As long as they hold this down here, bulls have no issues with trading this higher to this next"
"628820","632780"," next price target above it 41080."
"633040","639120"," If this debt does get broken here, if you start to see us push back and trade underneath that five"
"639120","640640"," minute, we'll head back down to 402. "
"641640","646980"," But otherwise, you've got nothing else to say other than we're bullish here and where do we go from"
"646980","647240"," here."
"647240","650580"," The price targets above are super high."
"650960","654500"," You're talking 430 minimum, if not for even 460. "
"655620","657800"," It's a major, major price targets above."
"658780","663960"," This trend would, if you think you've missed the trade here at this point, this trend could last"
"663960","667620"," for two months that long, like one month, two months."
"668440","673940"," Even if we come back and retest 402 as long as there's as long as as long as even if"
"673940","675660"," it's up here, we come way back down here. "
"675660","680340"," And then to trade higher, if we go all of it before 10, come back down here, you're still talking"
"680340","682560"," about one, two months of up."
"683740","685300"," There's nothing to say about that."
"685660","687980"," The first retest of that hourly down here, 402. "
"688940","695200"," As long as it holds, you're talking about, you know, one month, March and April, all bullside, man."
"695320","697960"," That's what's going to end up being is all bullside as long as this."
"698380","699920"," This is the magic place down here. "
"700180","701920"," This, this is the money shot for bulls."
"702500","708220"," If they're, if they're able to hold 402, even if they trade under for five minutes, as long as they"
"708220","708600"," hold it."
"709040","714300"," You're talking about huge moves for about a month, month and a half somewhere in there for the"
"714300","714500"," bulls. "
"714700","718480"," And this is the place where this is bears last stand."
"719120","725420"," As soon as if this rolls over down to 402, if it sells off 410, so if it sells off"
"725420","729460"," 405, 410, and the bears need to break through this daily."
"729460","735540"," And I'll tell you what, every, every time in the past, one of two things have happened, bulls have"
"735540","737260"," confirmed that upward move. "
"737780","738820"," You can better get out of the way."
"739200","743460"," And then all of 2022, they sold off of a high on a squeeze."
"744480","746560"," Bears ended up selling off a high up here. "
"746820","748200"," This is how speaking of coffee to meet."
"748420","749880"," In the US."
"751500","757160"," Tell me, let me know if you can hear the financial squacker in the background talking. "
"758520","764920"," So in all of 2022, we would normally green bar up to right here or green bar up to right"
"764920","767720"," here, and then it would blast straight to the depths of hell."
"768720","772980"," But I don't, and this is below, and below this line right here, it would just be, we were back."
"773080","774580"," We did it once in several things. "
"774780","776860"," We squeezed the 416 or something."
"777060","777980"," It was an automatic short."
"778440","782160"," Went down like 70 hundred points and another like 200 points a few days later. "
"782160","788440"," But other than that, I mean, this confirms to an extent, the moment we recope, go back and retest"
"788440","796580"," this daily, that the trend for one, two months is up, which is a huge change for the stream is"
"796580","797280"," you in the market."
"797520","797540"," Right."
"798180","798380"," This weekend. "
"801320","804520"," I was looking for over the free trial."
"804620","808620"," Don't come claims of a new bull market."
"808620","811580"," You want to see everybody loading up on calls in here. "
"812140","817300"," That's what bears are looking for is for bulls to get comfortable that we're going to go major,"
"817300","818680"," major, major higher."
"820040","826520"," So we want to see if the bulls actually load up and take this market to at least four thirty"
"826520","828020"," four twenty four thirty minimum."
"828020","831740"," We already got told no four twenties, not not for us. "
"832340","837360"," Bulls are looking forward to that four thirty four, believe it or not, test of all time highs."
"838140","839100"," That's the claim."
"839940","840660"," That's out there. "
"840740","843420"," And that's what some of the only wave stuff is telling us as well."
"844800","846840"," Is that is that we will go there."
"848040","852900"," Coming into the coming months, March and April specifically. "
"854520","856240"," This is how I will visit both California."
"856460","863440"," Missing so I haven't read any of your chat yet."
"863780","864200"," Good morning. "
"864360","864860"," You know how are you?"
"864940","865120"," Good morning."
"865240","865360"," Winky."
"865520","865780"," How are you?"
"866120","867960"," Apologize for the for the. "
"869600","870480"," Delay this morning."
"870480","871920"," Oh, I'm trying to check something out here."
"873880","876000"," Let me put the news squad up for you. "
"876340","878660"," I got all kinds of screwiness going on here this morning."
"886650","889590"," So you put this news news ticker up here for you."
"900260","900840"," There we go. "
"900940","901340"," That might help."
"906310","908070"," Can you guys see that news ticker now?"
"908350","908790"," Okay, good."
"914610","915750"," Just a second here. "
"940310","941690"," Maybe that helps a little bit."
"942610","944530"," Try to bring book map down a little bit."
"974060","975120"," Let's see who's out there. "
"975180","975720"," Good morning, Nino."
"976360","978200"," Good morning, Calaverick and Brickian."
"978580","980660"," Good morning, AJ, and wide seat. "
"981160","981920"," See, build."
"983620","984320"," Tricky bourbon."
"986240","986680"," Yeah. "
"987520","988420"," I've got it sitting out."
"988620","992060"," I've got a bunch of fans on it right now and I'm hoping that it's not completely fucked up."
"1005210","1006810"," You read some of your comments in here. "
"1011430","1012290"," See what's going on."
"1012530","1013310"," More until the cheese."
"1015550","1016510"," All right, I've caught up. "
"1016610","1017750"," I think I've caught up at least."
"1019590","1020130"," We're in BD."
"1020390","1020750"," How are you?"
"1021910","1022750"," Put it in rice. "
"1022990","1023910"," Yeah, I was like, fuck that."
"1024569","1026530"," I was like, I was like, we're not even at rice."
"1026770","1026970"," I think. "
"1027510","1029510"," Well, the water splashed over the connections."
"1030730","1034030"," So I'm hoping that it's just I just killed the connections on the monitor."
"1035490","1036210"," So we'll see. "
"1036369","1038310"," We'll see if that's the case or not this morning."
"1038310","1043470"," And if it is, so be it."
"1052930","1056310"," Now after today, I'm going to have to go back in and reset all the monitors. "
"1056750","1058190"," Windows 11 is kind of a weird thing."
"1058350","1063850"," I have a Windows 11 on this stuff and it tries to automatically figure everything out."
"1063930","1067890"," If you disconnect, it's like, oh, we're going to reconnect all this the way that we want to do it"
"1067890","1068810"," or we think you want to do it. "
"1072800","1078100"," Yes, even my displays are kind of these aren't the resolutions that I want for my displays."
"1087640","1089280"," You have mugs with caps on them."
"1089360","1090020"," No shit, right?"
"1090560","1091040"," That's funny. "
"1091080","1092620"," It's funny to my wife this morning."
"1093260","1099800"," After this happened, handed me this one of my kids hiking water bottles and it's like pink and"
"1099800","1100040"," purple."
"1100740","1102580"," And it's got a snap lid on it. "
"1102600","1103780"," And she's like, here, try this honey."
"1103780","1105120"," And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no."
"1105700","1107380"," I'm like, don't try that bullshit on me. "
"1107500","1112620"," I'm like, I don't want, like, and it's like, it's like, it's like subtle."
"1113420","1114220"," It's like subtle."
"1114940","1116140"," Maybe you need to be a child. "
"1118420","1120200"," She was being very subtle in her."
"1121860","1123060"," Very subtle in her."
"1123820","1125800"," Maybe you need a sippy cup or something. "
"1130640","1131340"," Yeah, good morning."
"1131340","1132040"," How's everybody doing?"
"1132040","1133420"," Hope you're all doing doing well out there."
"1135400","1136280"," I think I did. "
"1136420","1137900"," I think it did spill coffee one time."
"1138320","1141240"," I did change my, I've got one of my kids."
"1142840","1145040"," I took down my mechanical keyboard. "
"1145480","1147660"," I got water on that to a mechanical keyboard."
"1148160","1150380"," So I've got one of my kids gaming keyboards up here."
"1153500","1157880"," I've got my building blocks and my crayons that won't roll off the table this morning. "
"1162120","1163680"," I've got it all figured out."
"1163880","1165140"," I got the playpen in the background."
"1174750","1176350"," I think I got it all figured out here. "
"1176490","1179710"," Let's put some of these here so we can get a brighter screen going at least."
"1180470","1181170"," There's our two."
"1181270","1181950"," There's our one. "
"1183350","1186330"," Let's see if we can at least get a brighter screen going here so you guys can get a better"
"1186330","1187190"," idea where we're at."
"1189730","1192710"," Price trying to fight on the one minute figure right here."
"1192750","1195330"," We'll see if we can get above it and start to win that. "
"1195530","1201930"," It's 11.02. Bulls have it right now at the next half an hour to re-win back our one"
"1201930","1202650"," for a trade higher."
"1228750","1232070"," And if we go, if we do go back down at any point, let's take a look at that real"
"1232070","1232530"," quick too."
"1233070","1235870"," So right here, we're going to take a look at these two places. "
"1235870","1239030"," Okay, this is PT two above right here."
"1239370","1240470"," This is PT one."
"1240610","1241450"," We already tagged that one. "
"1243010","1247570"," And then if we were to sell off down here at any point, the one you're looking to buy down"
"1247570","1251290"," below is going, I don't know why that isn't showing up either."
"1251770","1253550"," I got weird shit going on this morning."
"1254190","1260290"," It's currently sitting at 40222. "
"1261210","1264490"," So right in here 40222."
"1264930","1266190"," This is what the Bulls want to buy."
"1269770","1271330"," Right there is where they want to buy. "
"1271850","1272870"," Right about there at that pivot."
"1274190","1276950"," Right about where this is where you want to be buying down in here."
"1279050","1281350"," You want to see the check, I should say. "
"1281770","1287210"," It doesn't matter if we trade up here and then check this tomorrow, Wednesday, whatever, but this"
"1287210","1291510"," is this is the key for Bulls for the next month or two is that this holds."
"1293210","1295550"," It'll be a paradigm shift."
"1295710","1303850"," You're talking about the VIX maybe being reprised at 12 bucks, something like that, 14 bucks, which"
"1303850","1309890"," is a significant down move or significant repricing of volatility in the market. "
"1310690","1317850"," That would mean that there's a fundamental change to market structure, right?"
"1318010","1322670"," Fundamental change to where the market's going to go, where it's going to head to that kind of"
"1322670","1322870"," stuff."
"1323410","1330270"," There's PT one right there tag and Bulls want to trade this up to 41080."
"1331310","1333930"," Let me make sure I got the exact price, right?"
"1334110","1335050"," But I think it's 41080. "
"1348800","1352000"," Hottabears slow down the squeeze, the market, squeeze, GME, no idea."
"1361740","1366580"," Yeah, we got a Fed Chair Powell speaking at 10 before the Senate."
"1367580","1369440"," I've seen those go both ways. "
"1370200","1373000"," I've seen you know that the market's going to get hedged into it for sure."
"1374020","1378280"," You will see a hedging into the into at least the Senate hearing and then I've seen the head of"
"1378280","1382720"," Senate hearing squeeze and then normally like in the Senate hearing it goes pretty well."
"1382720","1386020"," And then it goes really ugly at some point. "
"1386080","1389440"," Someone's asking the right the right or wrong questions that kind of stuff."
"1390820","1393040"," You can see in book map, there's sellers right here."
"1393040","1397280"," A little little yellow bar here of sellers, then it's just above it at R2. "
"1397740","1399240"," You can draw those in for you."
"1399280","1402820"," A little bit of weakness right here, but though I'm not trusting that it's overly weak."
"1403660","1404580"," Make that yellow. "
"1405880","1409740"," The book map line and then we'll do one more above it."
"1410280","1414120"," And this right here is another book map line just above."
"1414880","1417760"," But I don't I don't think these are ever any consequence at this moment. "
"1419560","1421480"," I'll actually move more a little bit for you."
"1422660","1423700"," So you can see him."
"1453720","1455640"," Who's who's this fucking guy?"
"1456880","1458040"," Who's this covet Dre?"
"1459200","1460460"," Who's that piece of shit?"
"1462920","1464820"," I don't want any sponsorships. "
"1465460","1466080"," Who's that guy?"
"1467660","1470800"," Who's that piece of shit trying to scam my stream here?"
"1482660","1485140"," Yeah, I got to do a Windows deep loader for sure."
"1485320","1488040"," I used to have one of my other desktop that I was running."
"1501370","1504110"," When volumes are low, we usually squeeze if you're wondering. "
"1510190","1511870"," Yeah, I don't know what to do about this."
"1511870","1520050"," My monitors are great because if I travel and I stream from somewhere else, I can pull them off and"
"1520050","1520850"," I put them in a backpack."
"1521250","1524790"," I can travel with four monitors and a laptop. "
"1525390","1527170"," That's the system is built to be portable."
"1530370","1531390"," They can't drag."
"1531830","1532750"," Their old heads are beautiful. "
"1549990","1551630"," Thanks, Wiki, for taking care of that."
"1551630","1554270"," I appreciate it."
"1554310","1554590"," You know what I get?"
"1554750","1560570"," I get emails all the time from companies that we have to have like fake companies or betting"
"1560570","1562650"," companies and two companies. "
"1563810","1565190"," All that sort of stuff."

"1571970","1575270"," They're all fake by signing up at to the tick dot com."
"1575990","1578190"," I don't respond to any of them."
"1578190","1583170"," I've got like a list of people that have offered to do sponsorships that are team legitimate. "
"1584210","1590110"," And then, and those are for only tools that I use and stuff like book map type stuff."
"1590770","1595110"," But then I get a ton of, you know, we're a company."

"1606870","1610390"," And I have have no real interest in that that sort of sort of shit."
"1610930","1611750"," Like when you see. "
"1614330","1616730"," I got some real fucking walking is going on here."
"1630570","1631330"," Yeah, they do."
"1631450","1632170"," They offer that stuff. "
"1632350","1632550"," I get."
"1633350","1637950"," You guys don't see a bunch of stuff like some of the stuff that I get via email."
"1637950","1644370"," They're like, hey, we can do is you can have your people get like if they're if they're bored, they"
"1644370","1646710"," can just gamble and we'll pay you for it. "
"1646710","1648450"," And I'm like, get the fuck out of here."
"1649970","1651530"," What the fuck is wrong with you?"
"1668050","1669090"," It's like straight nefarious."
"1672390","1673170"," Straight nefarious. "
"1676390","1680250"," Like Bitcoin scams, crypto scams, NFT, no offense."
"1680450","1683330"," You like that stuff, but the scams are at least huge."
"1684450","1688190"," Like the scams are at least the hey, we'll pay you to push this stuff. "
"1688190","1690990"," And I'm like, I'm not fucking pushing anything to anybody."
"1693010","1694030"," There's a fame."
"1694170","1696050"," I'm not going to say who, but there's a famous YouTuber. "
"1696750","1699270"," They had a they had a channel."
"1699950","1701730"," They had a secondary channel."
"1702390","1706110"," They were running a like crypto pumps on. "
"1706470","1710610"," And they recently just shut it down like about a month or two ago."
"1710990","1715730"," And they were getting paid bank like thousands of dollars a day to."
"1717310","1719010"," Like thousands of bucks a day too. "
"1719210","1723230"," So these two yellow boxes are just what you're seeing right now on book."
"1723370","1726830"," These are the book map yellow boxes above here where some sellers are."
"1728690","1730850"," Probably get rid of this one right here because they've come down. "
"1730930","1734150"," Looks like they've consolidated and come down at this point."
"1745000","1746680"," And just consolidation at this moment."
"1746740","1749520"," No real just just consolidation. "
"1749920","1751260"," One minute's week, five minutes week."
"1752480","1755400"," We'll look towards 11 15 see if bears can put this together."
"1756600","1760420"," And then we'll look towards 11 30 and see if the bears are going to put some together or not. "
"1763340","1767320"," I really want to buy four or two really bad like I'm extremely bad."
"1767440","1767960"," I want to see it."
"1768000","1772180"," Well, I want to see us trade down to four or two consolidate and allow the one in five minutes"
"1772180","1775540"," to come back down and then do a four trigger cluster and take that next trade. "
"1788400","1791860"," You guys want to see Tesla this morning, possibly I guess."
"1794240","1796160"," Yeah, so Tesla's looking weak too."
"1797600","1798960"," We can take a look at Tesla. "
"1799420","1799760"," I don't know."
"1800180","1801000"," Tesla's looking squeezy."
"1802660","1805880"," It's squeezy, but it's also looking a little weak. "
"1807060","1808320"," So we'll look at Tesla real quick."
"1818800","1821240"," We're going to get GME next if you want to hold on here."
"1822820","1825480"," We'll take a look at we'll take a look at UNG. "
"1825680","1828460"," We'll take a look at UNG."
"1829720","1831160"," UNG GME Tesla."
"1832120","1836980"," Now one of the good things here for Tesla is it's on a four trigger was a five trigger cluster. "
"1837300","1840760"," One, two, three, and four trigger cluster."
"1841020","1841660"," It's coiling up."
"1842540","1844460"," It is currently trading underneath. "
"1846120","1847940"," It is currently trading underneath."
"1848380","1851420"," It's a one minute right now, which is kind of bearish here, right?"
"1853300","1856460"," It wants to sell down and where does it want to sell down to?"
"1856960","1862260"," It wants to sell down to its daily and recheck it right here, 189, 97."
"1863060","1866680"," So you'd be looking, no, this doesn't mean we can't trade above it. "
"1866900","1869180"," So this is what I'll give you for a Tesla."
"1870680","1873460"," So I'll give you for a Tesla or an idea is on Tesla here."
"1874340","1876140"," You want to keep an eye above. "
"1879200","1880820"," You want to keep an eye above."
"1886510","1888790"," Above 197 on Tesla."
"1889750","1897190"," If price is able, so if price is able to consolidate down here, come above and start to make a"
"1897190","1900010"," move above 197, it'll be bullish again. "
"1901690","1908270"," But until it can, until price can get above here, it's still, it's at this point where you don't"
"1908270","1908550"," buy it."
"1908610","1913130"," It's at a point where you're looking for Tesla to believe it or not trade back down."
"1913130","1916870"," To at least 190 somewhere in here. "
"1919390","1920430"," And consolidate."
"1921090","1923110"," So you would see his price come down on Tesla."
"1924570","1925150"," Right. "
"1925290","1927970"," You want to see some consolidation here for a move higher."
"1929830","1933490"," And you want to see the one in five minute come down."
"1934630","1935430"," Just here. "
"1938270","1945030"," Yes, crude futures turned positive after falling by one minute and the five minute come underneath."
"1948810","1950470"," That bids for six month bills."
"1950690","1950890"," Totally. "
"1951030","1954750"," Even the hourly price to slam higher here."
"1955430","1957810"," Now, there's nothing saying you're not bullish on Tesla."
"1958090","1959690"," But if you're, if you want to take that. "
"1960170","1961950"," It is above 1 more."
"1962070","1967230"," This is a very strong cluster here, but this could be interpreted as being quite bearish."
"1967250","1969750"," Or at least on the intraday on Tesla. "
"1971350","1972890"," You look at UNG and."
"1974410","1975770"," We'll get UNG next."
"1977850","1979710"," And kind of the same thing, right?"
"1980210","1982770"," So UNG came up, sold off. "
"1983630","1986150"," Now it's underneath prices underneath."
"1986530","1986990"," It's hourly."
"1987350","1987630"," It's underneath. "
"1988010","1988290"," It's daily."
"1988630","1988870"," It's underneath."
"1989210","1989770"," It's five minute. "
"1990110","1991110"," And it's underneath."
"1992770","1993770"," It's one minute right now."
"1993930","1995030"," So let's look at UNG. "
"1995030","1997890"," UNG is getting strong here though."
"1998530","2000130"," It is getting strong currently."
"2001850","2002690"," The dilly. "
"2002870","2003210"," It's okay."
"2003290","2004010"," It's not that great."
"2004670","2007790"," If you wanted to trade UNG for a trade higher. "
"2008470","2018410"," You want to see price"
"2018410","2025930"," get above 864 and you may have a trade down to let's call it nine bucks."
"2028030","2030450"," So just a 50 cent trade somewhere in there."
"2033050","2036410"," You might get all the way up to it's possible you could get up to. "
"2043160","2044540"," 916 somewhere in there."
"2044640","2048320"," But even then you're not looking to buy this unless it trades above."
"2049139","2050820"," And hold 864. "
"2051360","2055340"," That's the trade above 864 and hold a lot of the one minute."
"2055520","2057880"," Take price higher to this 910."
"2058600","2060920"," You cut your you cut them loose in here. "
"2061340","2063320"," So you'll be looking for price to get above."
"2063880","2068060"," You could take that trade right there, but you don't want to get caught in here because this could"
"2068060","2068719"," roll over."
"2069239","2071560"," You want to see the consolidation for a move higher. "
"2072880","2077560"," Next trade above from there would be right here."
"2078440","2079400"," Hold on here."
"2083690","2088270"," Next by would be at like 932 941 something like that. "
"2094650","2096670"," And until we get this down here."
"2115540","2119580"," See right there you're not really trying to buy this noise unless you get above here."
"2120280","2125400"," Otherwise we could easily be trading down to eight bucks or so on UNG. "
"2130540","2133400"," GME trading very nicely now trade in 1937."
"2134460","2137160"," Trading above it's hourly it's one minute it's five minute."
"2138960","2141120"," You might be able to get up to 20 bucks right here. "
"2141120","2143380"," I believe it or not as long as price stays above."
"2146460","2148560"," Make this one yellow."
"2153910","2157630"," As long as price stays above on GME. "
"2161770","2167790"," 1930 1921 you get another dip by down here it's possible to grab another dip by down here to get"
"2167790","2168030"," higher."
"2174370","2178530"," At 1826 the trade is over if we trade below 1881."
"2179390","2180430"," On GME. "
"2182450","2184550"," Definitely take the money and run it 20 bucks."
"2185770","2187850"," I'd be looking for GME to."
"2190170","2194350"," Any kind of pullback as long as you're as long as you're above 1880 you're good to go. "
"2194910","2198290"," But any kind of pullback you could probably buy here take it to 20 bucks."
"2198910","2201050"," You're going to look for a rejection down here."
"2201490","2204450"," Your next buy above would be above 20 dollars. "
"2204450","2208210"," So you got let's go make this a red here."
"2212590","2218450"," And a possible buy above 20 dollars anything above 20 bucks you might get some good action."
"2218990","2223290"," But you're going to want the hourly the one minute and all that stuff to catch up on it. "
"2224650","2229850"," You want all these all these figures to catch up and price to be above 20 dollars."
"2230090","2232730"," So the idea here would be price goes up here."
"2233670","2238190"," Starts to consolidate you want to see the five minute come up and the hour leak them up. "
"2238450","2241710"," And then you could possibly take another trade higher from here."
"2243770","2244870"," On 20 bucks."
"2246490","2249190"," And try to attack somewhere up in here. "
"2249630","2255610"," It's 10 minutes away now to get the three and six month 21 80 the US selling 57 billion dollars."
"2255890","2258470"," Those three month bills were part of its cover of two to 59."
"2259010","2263810"," Somewhere high you have a four spot 75% and the US selling four straight. "
"2264010","2267350"," Six month bills were probably to cover four to 94."
"2268770","2271370"," And apologies are probably to cover of two to 80 in a par."
"2271510","2272210"," Universal here. "
"2272450","2279710"," Move the spire over for you."
"2288980","2290240"," PT one was tagged."
"2322860","2325060"," You guys hear this new squawk in the background. "
"2325060","2325520"," Let me know."
"2351280","2355840"," Spine out rolling over and it's five or it's one minute trying to trade down to four oh six forty"
"2355840","2356180"," three."
"2383160","2384780"," You can hear it loud and clear right up. "
"2386680","2387600"," It's a brain crude."
"2387920","2391440"," It's time positive after folding more than one dollar barrel."
"2397590","2406770"," This stream is sponsored by. "
"2406770","2407950"," That takes right dot com."
"2411330","2413030"," Yeah, I'm going to throw on some."
"2413330","2421580"," I'm going to throw on some four oh two zero only six cents. "
"2481390","2482670"," That's really weird."
"2482730","2483190"," I've got some."
"2487010","2490730"," Tasty works is asking me for eight cents for four oh two P's. "
"2491790","2495550"," And they're saying that they're only worth six to seven cents and I don't know why they're asking"
"2495550","2496670"," me for eight cents for those."
"2531430","2533690"," Watching funky ass order flow stuff."
"2534110","2535990"," I can't get a fill. "
"2539490","2541550"," So I'm watching a sign my end."
"2543850","2545490"," Four or two P's."
"2545850","2547370"," They're showing six and seven cents. "
"2547570","2550330"," Five minutes away now to get the three and six month bill auction."
"2552450","2561870"," City is asking me to pay eight cents."
"2561870","2562190"," I'm going to throw on the bills. "
"2562610","2565830"," But probably it's covered two to eighty and a pro high yield of four spot nine."
"2565830","2566270"," Good morning."
"2566470","2566890"," How y'all doing?"
"2566910","2568990"," Um, nineteen ten sixty eight. "
"2573190","2574030"," Yeah, it's really weird."
"2574110","2576550"," I'm trying to get a fill and I can't get a fill."
"2576690","2578950"," Oh, they're asking me for an extra two pennies or something. "
"2580830","2582450"," On four oh two P's."
"2595200","2596900"," Yeah, they're not wanting to give them to me."
"2596900","2609810"," I don't think"
"2609810","2610390"," it's algos. "
"2610630","2612970"," I think somebody is out bidding me is what's going on."
"2613390","2615390"," They have border flow payment border flow."
"2615590","2616130"," So we'll see. "
"2620070","2626490"," I think my thought process here is that they're worth like nine or ten cents at this moment."
"2627370","2628270"," And they're right now."
"2628390","2630950"," So they're right now still showing six or seven cents. "
"2632470","2634110"," And it's really bizarre."
"2634290","2637630"," We see what they're asking for the other buyers that eight cents right now."
"2638870","2640150"," Anybody noticing that on their end?"
"2640490","2643950"," Anybody seen any funky border flow stuff right now?"
"2646290","2647830"," Is it just me?"
"2648930","2649850"," That's noticing this. "
"2652970","2654170"," You got to fill it seven."
"2654330","2655270"," Let me see if I can grab some."
"2669590","2673190"," Yeah, there's a bid to buy those eleven thousand Jesus. "
"2682490","2684490"," Now trading down to the five minute right now."
"2684630","2686470"," It's eleven twenty seven three minutes left."
"2687110","2688890"," Four bears to get this crossover. "
"2689290","2690430"," This bears crossover here."
"2692130","2694770"," Yeah, the price is kind of fucking weird, man."
"2695890","2697470"," It's kind of fucking weird right here. "
"2703010","2705490"," Three minutes left for the bears to get underneath the five minute trigger."
"2731480","2732620"," It's in the mirror right now."
"2732620","2732880"," See it. "
"2732900","2733220"," Look at this."
"2733300","2733680"," Right."
"2733900","2736840"," It's by 50 basis points in March, May and June. "
"2737000","2738920"," I'm like 25 basis points in July."
"2739040","2739420"," This is angry."
"2739680","2741120"," We're going to raise this at forecast for ECB. "
"2741480","2743800"," Tom and Ray to four sport to five percent by July."
"2743800","2745620"," This is like three spots five percent."
"2745740","2746060"," Previously. "
"2749510","2751830"," The fix on the one minute is like a."
"2752190","2753770"," I got some really wack out."
"2754130","2756770"," Dude, I got some serious shit going on right now."
"2758550","2761930"," I got weebel hiding. "
"2767080","2767900"," There we go."
"2772930","2774530"," Vix is getting angry now."
"2776510","2778190"," Vix has some gaps to fill above. "
"2787250","2790190"," Surely expecting the three and six month bill auction."
"2790370","2791830"," I'll lead with the three month fits together."
"2793070","2794310"," Vix needs to stay. "
"2794530","2796810"," Vix needs to break above 1876."
"2798050","2800070"," To trade like 1920 or so."
"2800070","2824240"," I have a"
"2824240","2827480"," small position here and puts now finally. "
"2827940","2828300"," So."
"2829380","2830080"," They're cheap."
"2830380","2831800"," They're fucking dirt cheap. "
"2831940","2833940"," So they're like seven, eight cents or something."
"2839170","2840930"," We can get above the one minute."
"2840930","2841670"," I'll take some calls. "
"2852290","2856290"," Yeah, I've got a fed chair speaking tomorrow at 10 a.m. Not today."
"2857110","2859150"," Does anybody want to clear that up so we don't have any."
"2859650","2861170"," Can anybody clear that up for me?"
"2870110","2873150"," Yeah, so Grubster's saying nothing against the cap and I'm on calls. "
"2873570","2875530"," I think if you're in calls here, it's no."
"2875870","2876330"," There's no."
"2876490","2880450"," If you're in calls and you can't make 10 cents or eight cents on your calls. "
"2881030","2882990"," There's no reason not to hold puts there with your calls."
"2883870","2884850"," Absolutely no reason."
"2885310","2890190"," I think you're insane to hold calls here and not not have 10 cent or eight cent or six cent"
"2890190","2891090"," puts along with them. "
"2891350","2894090"," If your calls can't make six cents on them and whatever you're trading."
"2895290","2897670"," And have a hedge here that they think it's insane."
"2904190","2905430"," They're dirt cheap right now. "
"2905510","2907230"," You guys understand how that works, right?"
"2907330","2908050"," If you're along the market."
"2908950","2912550"," These hedge funds, when I hedge funds, but yeah, hedge funds and banks and stuff."
"2913030","2913770"," Find that cheap hedge. "
"2915570","2918090"," And so like six cents for two P's."
"2918970","2919170"," I'll take."
"2919230","2920970"," I'll take 300 of them, please. "
"2921250","2921890"," Thank you very much."
"2925050","2926410"," I'll take 300 of them."
"2926590","2927410"," Give them to me. "
"2928930","2929910"," Give them all to me."
"2930050","2931430"," I'll sell them to you, though, at a dollar."
"2932930","2934870"," Whenever it's time to sell them and you're bearish. "
"2935030","2935610"," Don't worry about it."
"2935690","2936050"," I got you."
"2937170","2937870"," They're all yours. "
"2942850","2946790"," If they go to a dollar, if they don't, I bet I could buy them three times and they'll still"
"2946790","2947410"," go to a dollar."
"2953870","2954330"," Yeah, yeah."
"2955890","2956250"," Yeah. "
"2957350","2957710"," Yeah."
"2957870","2958170"," Yeah."
"2958290","2958490"," Yeah. "
"2958490","2959490"," Seven, six, five percent."
"2959650","2961190"," Four spots, seven, six, five percent."
"2961610","2964370"," So the U.S. sells 61 billion dollars a three month bill. "
"2964430","2965170"," There's no real ones."
"2965310","2966670"," If you're going to be long here, you might as well."
"2966890","2967470"," Just throw a second. "
"2967690","2968330"," Five months."
"2968330","2968750"," Fits cover."
"2968970","2969730"," Because it calls them. "
"2969810","2974890"," If you have a dollar ton, it goes to $1.30. You're just made twenty four sevens."
"2974990","2976850"," Fifty one billion dollars of six month bills."
"2977130","2978950"," You can learn the puts for zero if you want. "
"2978950","2980670"," Six percent of its time."
"2990240","2991920"," Sit down some major support here."
"2992220","2995120"," You see this blue line right here and you can see it on book map. "
"2995580","2996700"," Then we want to hold this here."
"2996780","2998180"," We don't want to get underneath it if you're a bull."
"3008420","3010260"," So I'm going to take a look at Tesla in the background. "
"3010660","3011720"," Tesla is trading underneath."
"3012040","3012440"," It's a."
"3015360","3016540"," It's one minute still."
"3016940","3017740"," It needs to get above. "
"3019020","3021400"," One ninety six one ninety seven something like that."
"3021400","3021960"," That's trade higher."
"3022960","3025120"," See if we can get a nice squeeze out of this for the bulls. "
"3026000","3027180"," They can hold this bottom."
"3032950","3034690"," And take a look at E.S. real quick."
"3040530","3042470"," E.S. coming into its hourly trigger. "
"3043570","3044850"," E.S. could dip a little bit more."
"3045130","3046850"," It could trade down or not."
"3047090","3047410"," We're all wrong. "
"3047750","3047870"," Yes."
"3051350","3054950"," It's this really wonky thing if I try to say E.S. on."
"3056730","3057310"," Trading view. "
"3057430","3058350"," It goes straight down."
"3059310","3062350"," E.S. can trade down to four zero seven one two five."
"3064430","3067960"," You can go a little bit more down here. "
"3081200","3083140"," Take a look on the five minute on spy."
"3088470","3089970"," Put a little box down below."
"3095510","3097030"," Four oh four ninety six. "
"3099050","3104190"," If you're a bearish here, if you're looking for that bearish cross."
"3106310","3109110"," Four oh four ninety six to be PT one for bears down below."
"3110410","3112310"," If you end up getting this cross over here. "
"3114310","3118870"," If you're looking for that trade, if you're a bear."
"3122210","3123490"," Something like that right there."
"3138090","3139070"," There it is right there. "
"3140310","3140830"," It might help."
"3173130","3176210"," Once Paul hits the cameras will be up on a two point fifteen seconds."
"3176210","3177710"," Yeah, that's what happened at the Senate hearings. "
"3177710","3178550"," It's really bizarre."
"3179370","3181230"," We usually trade down into them."
"3181290","3182650"," Then we go ballistic north. "
"3183350","3187570"," And when he starts the talk, he usually does some pretty good stroking in the Senate hearing."
"3188450","3192470"," Hearings and then he comes out later in dishes, nastiness, although."
"3193470","3198190"," Do you guys remember when he did a you guys are doing a Senate hearing?"
"3198390","3199110"," He ended up doing a."
"3200170","3201270"," He I think he announced. "
"3202650","3205910"," A an unannounced rate hike or something like I don't know what he did."
"3206050","3207470"," I remember was some kind of rate hike."
"3207790","3211430"," I think Trump like freaked out later in the daytime and the market just. "
"3212270","3213870"," Fucking it just burned."
"3214310","3216290"," I'll try to I'll try to remember where that happened."
"3217630","3221890"," You guys remember that I was like two thousand eighteen two thousand nineteen or something. "
"3222790","3226470"," He you guys remember when that was to anybody in the chat."
"3226990","3229310"," Remember when that took place we had a."
"3231670","3232990"," I'll move this over for you."
"3233090","3234070"," This is what the bulls want to hold. "
"3237870","3239010"," You guys remember when."
"3241610","3247110"," You guys remember that is really wild because I think I think no one expected it."
"3247270","3250770"," I think like anyone with anyone that anyone with money was like. "
"3251490","3255630"," No one told them that there was going to be a written unannounced rate hike or some."
"3256990","3259290"," I remember it exactly right now to look it up."
"3268260","3269400"," It says Jay. "
"3269500","3271800"," How statement might be released tonight after the bell."
"3272540","3273200"," Do you have."
"3274680","3278060"," Calibric and where's that announced that was that a news story somewhere. "
"3280820","3282000"," Where did you read that bro."
"3285120","3288860"," Yes trading down to its five minute right here we're going to see if we can get a nice bounce"
"3288860","3289620"," here for the bulls."
"3297910","3301630"," It doesn't hold if four zero seven one. "
"3303110","3308690"," Four zero seven one doesn't hold will trade down lower to four four three point two five."
"3309410","3310470"," So we'll see right here."
"3310590","3311630"," If it holds or not. "
"3328690","3329870"," He's speaking on Tuesday."
"3329890","3330610"," That's what I thought."
"3334280","3335340"," So you guys are saying. "
"3336020","3336460"," I'm."
"3336640","3337080"," I'm."
"3338540","3340060"," David Paul statement might be what. "
"3343700","3346320"," Do I think Jay Paul make the market pump."
"3346460","3346980"," I think he does."
"3347260","3350780"," I think I think that you get a I think there's a little bit of hedge in the market heading"
"3350780","3351180"," into. "
"3351820","3352760"," The Senate hearing."
"3353140","3355400"," I think that once he talks he's going to try to reassure."
"3356880","3357580"," Everybody there. "
"3357680","3358200"," Everything's okay."
"3358900","3359920"," And then you're going to get."
"3360720","3366880"," Some senators saying the price of this is what this this is almost guaranteed how it goes is. "
"3367800","3369820"," We've got a bunch of stuff going on you've got."
"3371240","3373720"," You've got an election coming up."
"3374960","3380880"," And so you want markets stability for the election or at least whoever's in whoever's in power"
"3380880","3381620"," wants that. "
"3382000","3386180"," Whoever wants to take power wants the market to be in."
"3386800","3387660"," Shambles right."
"3388200","3393180"," The more the markets and shambles the better case there is to change regimes. "
"3393980","3396060"," I don't care who's in power."
"3396060","3397500"," I don't care if it's Republicans Democrats."
"3397980","3399140"," I don't care who's in power. "
"3400220","3401060"," They want it."
"3401160","3402180"," They want the market to be stable."
"3402560","3405000"," Anyone that's not in power wants the market and shambles. "
"3405380","3409520"," It makes it easier to make a case for I can fix."
"3410180","3411740"," All of our problems right."
"3412700","3414680"," At least for the election season. "
"3415200","3420280"," And then you've got the Senate and you've got Jerome Powell and he's at the behest of whoever's in"
"3420280","3420580"," power."
"3420920","3422960"," And he's going to come out with normally."
"3424120","3429940"," His whole job is to stabilize prices, stabilize the housing. "
"3430240","3433720"," Well, I guess him in the treasury, stabilize housing, stabilize the markets."
"3434880","3436980"," You know, soft landing all that kind of bullshit."
"3436980","3440260"," And that's his job. "
"3440460","3442200"," So you're going to hear him, of course."
"3443220","3448260"," Or not, of course, but likely talk that they just say we're doing a great job here."
"3448700","3452360"," You know, he's not going to be like we suck and we're not doing what we're supposed to be doing. "
"3452820","3456140"," He's going to he's going to be like say we're unsure."
"3456600","3458080"," We're doing the best job that we can."
"3458380","3459740"," We seem to be making progress. "
"3460660","3461680"," Basically those things."
"3462400","3463840"," And then what you get is."
"3463840","3467360"," So you'll have like the hedge on the market and Casey announces something crazy. "
"3468100","3469800"," You know, like we're doing one percent."
"3471600","3473320"," One percent tomorrow, right."
"3473480","3475500"," So today slam that button. "
"3477120","3478820"," So that would be the hedge of the market."
"3478980","3482580"," And then he'll try to sound like he's a rocket scientist, right."
"3484200","3485920"," Like he's the smart guy in the room. "
"3486460","3487540"," Although he's a hammer and a nail."
"3487760","3488180"," We know that."
"3488800","3490420"," So you've got that going on. "
"3490420","3495440"," And then you should hear who the expected would be to hear after that."
"3495560","3496740"," That initial squeeze higher."
"3496940","3500900"," You'll hear questions come from senators that want to create turmoil. "
"3501020","3507360"," So they will ask questions of him typically like, Hey, you suck."
"3507740","3510100"," And let's make the market go down."
"3510240","3516040"," So you should see the reversal off of those questions, usually 20 minutes, half an hour later"
"3516040","3520400"," during a Q and A kind of stuff. "
"3520400","3523420"," That's what I've at least that's what my experience is bad."
"3523560","3528580"," Only a few times have I seen those Senate hearings go differently."
"3529080","3532420"," Now, if you've only been in the market since, I don't know, 2021 or 2020. "
"3533840","3538420"," They used to, they used to prior to you being in the market."
"3539160","3541460"," Oftentimes those hearings were very volatile."
"3542540","3545700"," And oftentimes they were used to slam the market down. "
"3546600","3547840"," You'd have outrageous shit happen."
"3547840","3551700"," And the market would just fucking burn to the ground in those heat in those hearings."
"3558050","3561530"," Yeah, we've got right now we're making some changes to discord. "
"3562170","3565850"," So if discord is new right now, it is being worked on currently."
"3567630","3570050"," We are making changes in discord right now."
"3570810","3573730"," So it'll just probably just be a minute or it could be a discord issue. "
"3581600","3582700"," Hey, Chase, how are you?"
"3593730","3597010"," Hey, Chase, I didn't have a chance to read your texts this morning."
"3597010","3597990"," I wasn't able to read them, brother."
"3598670","3602290"," I got all fucked up on my live stream this morning. "
"3602570","3603910"," I'm having real, not me."
"3604090","3607610"," Well, kind of major technical problems this morning getting on stream."
"3613850","3614250"," Okay. "
"3614590","3615490"," And you know, that happens, man."
"3615670","3617110"," Discord has outages all the time."
"3618330","3620470"," Not well, maybe not recently, but they used to. "
"3620670","3622250"," You guys remember when discord used to go down."
"3623410","3626550"," Discord had like a summer of going down every three days."
"3627050","3629410"," Five days discord would just nuke itself. "
"3651930","3654390"," Getting a little bit of a crossover here now in."
"3655850","3656510"," Yeah, I did."
"3656610","3659510"," So I got some puts, man, and they're just sitting there. "
"3659610","3660450"," They're not making money."
"3660610","3661350"," They're not losing money."
"3663990","3665450"," Nothing, nothing right here. "
"3666130","3668090"," Is there something that anybody knows that I don't know here?"
"3677760","3679000"," Thanks, Nino, for the heads up."
"3679400","3685880"," Nino is saying, uh, do not restart discord or you'll get kicked out across discord."
"3686120","3686960"," There's an outage supposedly. "
"3695400","3698060"," Yeah, I've got, I've got some, I've got some puts now."
"3698880","3701980"," Uh, if we start squeezing higher here, I'll take them off, but."
"3703400","3705720"," I do have some puts here in case we roll this over. "
"3708160","3710520"," Looks like it's, I pick them up somewhere in here."
"3711480","3714620"," Uh, so we'll, we'll see if we could squeeze up for a minute, but."
"3715560","3717420"," Be looking for something like that, at least. "
"3719980","3721960"," Gonna get it all as Chase would say."
"3722460","3724440"," Gotta get the bulls all bolded up in here."
"3729100","3731160"," Everybody all along the market right here. "
"3731960","3751220"," I alone can"
"3751220","3751780"," fix it."
"3751880","3752380"," Yeah, dude."
"3752620","3753600"," That's some, that's some J."
"3753780","3753880"," Pow. "
"3754060","3754660"," Right there."
"3755280","3759280"," Has anybody, anybody in this stream at all traded before 2020?"
"3759280","3760500"," Remember that shit."
"3761060","3763360"," There's gotta be somebody in this stream. "
"3763360","3765060"," Billion years of the fastest pace."
"3765320","3767180"," It remembers the old school Senate hearings."
"3767480","3768380"," Does anybody here?"
"3768980","3771000"," Has anybody traded longer than fucking four years?"
"3777800","3780100"," This dream is sponsored by to the tick. "
"3780620","3781960"," Get free daily points."
"3782340","3784040"," The banachi and market profile levels."
"3784480","3784840"," Okay. "
"3785040","3787780"," So who was in that it was October of 2018."
"3787780","3788860"," Do you remember that shit?"
"3789520","3790620"," That was wild."
"3792620","3793940"," I gotta remember. "
"3794340","3796460"," So October of 2018, let me look up on a chart."
"3801240","3804400"," I gotta look up spy in October of 2018."
"3808610","3809690"," It was gnarly. "
"3809930","3811930"," It was it was fucking gnarly."
"3814310","3815430"," We look on the daily."
"3822530","3824070"," Oh, yeah, there it is. "
"3824630","3825930"," Dude, look at that shit."
"3826190","3826970"," Can you believe that?"
"3827210","3828790"," I mean, look at October of 2019."
"3833430","3837550"," Look at October 2nd or October 3rd of 2019. "
"3837550","3838350"," It was a nightmare."
"3839070","3842690"," And wasn't it like I think it was like a month or two later where they backtracked."
"3843610","3844970"," I think they like they did it. "
"3845710","3847410"," And then they were like, no, no, no, no, no."
"3847490","3848770"," Like two months later or something."
"3851690","3853390"," It was a fucking bloodbath. "
"3861350","3865110"," Oh, yeah, you can start."
"3865230","3865530"," Yeah, dude."
"3865670","3866310"," Do you remember this?"
"3866510","3867250"," It wasn't just me. "
"3867930","3868990"," It totally wasn't."
"3869090","3870130"," So I don't."
"3870330","3875130"," I thought maybe I thought maybe I was misremembering this shit, but I totally fucking remember. "
"3876990","3880530"," Oh, matter of fact, I was trading the pot stocks, I think."
"3880950","3882590"," I think I was trading marijuana."
"3883070","3885390"," It was like the I think that was the first MJ craze. "
"3886950","3890710"," With the Canadian marijuana stock craze or some nonsense like that."
"3891590","3895450"," And I was like, I think I was long spy that day."
"3897450","3899070"," I think I was long spy. "
"3899330","3900310"," I didn't even see you."
"3900510","3903130"," Diamond says overall trends in the world are inflationary."
"3906330","3910690"," And it was it was fucking gnarly. "
"3911110","3912910"," It was totally fucking gnarly."
"3914050","3914710"," Yeah, dude."
"3914850","3917470"," Look, you should see my my puts are like. "
"3918810","3919570"," Haven't moved."
"3921170","3923930"," What the fuck is going on with the put side here?"
"3924510","3926030"," It's like the puts of just frozen."
"3928550","3933950"," What the fuck is going on in the what's going on the put side of the of the options market. "
"3933950","3935170"," They're literally frozen."
"3941540","3946740"," And JP Morgan's diamond says the consumer is in great shape now that to end."
"3946740","3950180"," You guys watching this fucking options chain right now. "
"3950480","3952440"," Am I like losing my mind here?"
"3954140","3955920"," I got to be losing my mind here."
"3958940","3960100"," It's frozen, right?"
"3960260","3961420"," Does anybody watching this shit?"
"3961780","3962160"," Say something."
"3962320","3962920"," I'm into it. "
"3963500","3968180"," Like so the puts have been the same price this whole move right here."
"3969340","3970200"," No change."
"3979930","3982410"," I don't know what's going on right now in the market. "
"3982410","3983470"," I apologize here."
"3984090","3985850"," I don't know what the fuck is going on."
"3986490","3992690"," It's got to be wiki saying that there's 11,000 buy order for spy puts that isn't getting filled. "
"3997650","3998530"," I'm not a bear."
"3999190","4001650"," Someone said just so you guys know I'm a bull."
"4002930","4005210"," I am able people know I'm a bull. "
"4007530","4010130"," But I'm watching or I'm not or I'm been some puts right now."
"4010550","4014170"," I'm just finding very fascinating that puts are gaining zero pennies."
"4014630","4015430"," Not one penny. "
"4015590","4016530"," It's not not it's not normal."
"4046650","4048050"," Yeah, just nothing in here."
"4048110","4049550"," Just waiting to see what happens here. "
"4049730","4053590"," We got 1150 bears have 10 minutes to put something together."
"4053710","4056110"," If they can't, we're going to start another trade higher."
"4056970","4060570"," We're going to get rid of this yellow box as sellers look like they've been worn out. "
"4063030","4066210"," Also, we'll see if the bears can take this down or not."
"4066830","4072090"," Their first target they're looking for is 405 and some change 404.89 somewhere in there."
"4073950","4075690"," See if they can put that together or not. "
"4080460","4082080"," I've got some puts on the market."
"4082260","4084920"," I've got no logs right here, but I do have some puts."
"4085180","4085540"," They're dirt cheap. "
"4085720","4087320"," They're six or seven cents or something."
"4087800","4088520"," Let me see what I got them at."
"4088620","4088800"," Hold on. "
"4100410","4102350"," I've got some puts at seven cents."
"4112859","4116660"," If we're able to regain the one minute up here, if at any point price gets above."
"4117859","4121720"," So if we have something like this happen, I'll just leave those puts on at that point. "
"4122880","4128080"," If we can get price above and we can get the one minute to get reclaimed."
"4129200","4132180"," Just like this, I'll go along on some calls, but there's seven cents."
"4132880","4135020"," If I can't make seven cents on some calls. "
"4136740","4140439"," Or like seven cents on some calls to hold this hedging at the end of the day today."
"4140960","4143560"," Probably do something similar tomorrow as well."
"4146359","4148160"," For Jay Powell and his speech. "
"4149180","4149920"," I don't want to see anything."
"4150300","4150819"," That's my one."
"4151020","4156840"," If I had one fear, I guess for tomorrow would be some kind of unannounced news that we don't know"
"4156840","4157160"," about. "
"4158100","4163439"," Outside of that, I'll be looking for 410 80 or so on the market to go up."
"4167680","4171939"," Yeah, bulls need to hold this right now for a six 37 ish."
"4183420","4184520"," Diamonds happen right now. "
"4189870","4192670"," Yeah, their their sound is kind of weird."
"4193630","4197350"," I'll turn it up a little bit for you on this new squacker."
"4204110","4207810"," House representative McCarthy saying we have reached the tipping point on debt. "
"4208750","4209550"," That's not true."
"4211230","4212650"," What kind of does he talking about?"
"4212650","4216490"," Did you guys see like, did you see that they reduced the debt by like two trillion?"
"4216670","4217310"," Are they claiming that?"
"4230480","4231640"," Now 11 53."
"4233860","4235120"," Not much going on here. "
"4239870","4241670"," Trading higher on the one minute right now."
"4245080","4247320"," I'm going to look for some calls if we can hold this."
"4247480","4248900"," We'll see if we can hold this right now. "
"4249700","4254040"," We've got a 407 C's have 220,000 calls on them."
"4254040","4256720"," Earlier, they were like a dollar 80 or something."
"4256880","4257820"," They've come down significantly. "
"4258580","4261380"," I'm going to look at those at a stack of those."
"4261640","4262700"," They're 63 cents."
"4265220","4269840"," The total trade will cost me seven cost me 70 cents or something like that. "
"4283780","4285700"," Just want to see a retest of the one minute."
"4286300","4287260"," See if we can get it."
"4322310","4323750"," Still only on put that right now. "
"4323790","4325510"," I want to see a retest of the one minute to take calls."
"4326030","4327450"," I won't tell those puts either."
"4327470","4328450"," I'll just keep them all day. "
"4340730","4341250"," That's weird."
"4341410","4342950"," The puts are down to five cents now."
"4344870","4347330"," So all this moved down right here. "
"4347430","4348330"," They didn't gain any value."
"4349190","4351750"," Now they lost two pennies though, right in this trade right here."
"4352950","4353490"," From this move higher. "
"4362110","4364930"," Even get a decent retest of the one minute here."
"4368650","4370110"," See if you guys can see this better."
"4389750","4391090"," Five minutes left for the bears. "
"4425150","4426250"," Well, I guess one good."
"4426410","4428210"," I guess one good thing about this morning."
"4428970","4430630"," My desktop went down. "
"4431550","4436950"," I already had some laptop laptops that had needed some work done on them."
"4437550","4440190"," And I didn't hadn't had the work done."
"4440330","4442270"," So I didn't have a backup desktop. "
"4443690","4448090"," Thankfully, this morning, I did have backup monitors, I guess."
"4448270","4451890"," I guess that's the bright side of having technical difficulties."
"4452230","4456370"," At least I had something to back up stream today. "
"4456570","4459110"," I should be grateful and not too pissed off."
"4475950","4477610"," I want to jump in some calls right here."
"4539390","4541110"," Man, I'm looking at the VIX and I'm like. "
"4544010","4548070"," The VIX is either going to eat a bag of a bag of dicks here or it's going to blast"
"4548070","4548890"," off to the moon."
"4550070","4554510"," If you are long here, the only thing I can tell you is make sure you've got a hedge."
"4555810","4559970"," If you're long for a move higher to 410 or anything like that, just make sure you have a hedge"
"4559970","4560270"," in the market. "
"4560270","4565270"," The dirt cheap, like pennies, like five cents, six cents, something like that."
"4565530","4566050"," Have a hedge."
"4567010","4568930"," Take the insurance policy out. "
"4570010","4571410"," I'm looking at VIX here, man."
"4571610","4577390"," VIX is at the bottom for VIX, but I'm going to 15 minute chart on VIX right now."
"4578510","4579730"," This is what I'm going to warn you here. "
"4579810","4581330"," We can go higher, but I want to show you something."
"4588330","4591750"," Maybe I can mute that real quick and just show you here."
"4593770","4595370"," Just be conscious of this. "
"4595370","4597810"," I want you to see where a VIX is right now."
"4600870","4603910"," This is a low right here on the 23rd."
"4604450","4606730"," A low right here on the 15th. "
"4606850","4608350"," Excuse me, that's the 23rd I was wrong."
"4608870","4615190"," The second thing all this down here is showing you that we could easily roll this market over."
"4615950","4619250"," At least for one day, just blast up here to 22 bucks. "
"4620210","4621230"," Maybe even higher."
"4621650","4623470"," Even though we're looking like we're bullish here."
"4623470","4624010"," Hold on here. "
"4627170","4631430"," If you're going to take the trade higher, I'm trying to take this trade higher myself."
"4632210","4634130"," I should have taken it just there and I didn't."
"4636330","4638490"," I missed this trade just a minute ago. "
"4638690","4642630"," The retest of the woman, it was fine, but just be conscious of that."
"4642730","4648250"," If you are long here, it's easy for us to just go straight bread bar to death down here."
"4648710","4653010"," So for five cent put, then I'll protect your longs for the move higher. "
"4653930","4655230"," Don't say I didn't warn you."
"4656810","4659850"," Don't say I didn't warn you in stream, okay?"
"4661990","4669570"," The euro dollar rises 0.6% to 1.0694, the highest level since February 21st."
"4679760","4681840"," Yeah, there's like no reason here not to. "
"4726810","4730010"," Yeah, I want to see if they blast this down."
"4730010","4734230"," I want to see if they rain this."
"4734370","4735270"," They're trying right now. "
"4735350","4737350"," These fucking bears, if they can, they're going to."
"4737770","4740630"," I'm trying to reverse this shit right now."
"4785510","4786310"," What do I think?"
"4787230","4791110"," I think I think it's easy to take a long here and then to. "
"4791210","4791470"," To."
"4791710","4796570"," If you can't make six cents, five cents on a, on a put or on the call side of a"
"4796570","4796750"," put."
"4797070","4797750"," Makes sense. "
"4798350","4798790"," So."
"4799990","4802510"," Four or seven C's are now 75 cents."
"4802710","4805430"," They were like 63 cents, just the five minutes ago. "
"4805970","4807870"," You buy a five cent put to go along with it."
"4807870","4811010"," If you can't turn 70 cent calls into 80 or 90 cent calls."
"4812430","4813170"," You shouldn't or not. "
"4813270","4819030"," You know, can't, but if you can't buy like a five cent put with that call, it's just, it's."
"4820230","4821830"," Would you say you call that."
"4824850","4826530"," Reckless with your own money, right?"
"4826710","4827570"," We're talking real money here. "
"4828090","4831810"," So like a six or five cent put to protect yourself if you're long here to go higher."
"4832890","4835010"," I think it's a rational not to."
"4835890","4837390"," Maybe maybe I'm wrong in that. "
"4837590","4840710"," Maybe it's like, Hey, I need those six pennies or five pennies or seven pennies."
"4841610","4843430"," I get that, but for right now."
"4844370","4845470"," This is set up to me. "
"4846510","4848290"," Seems very risky to take it."
"4848470","4849310"," I want to take it here."
"4849310","4854750"," I want to take this trade to right up here, like 410 52 or something. "
"4855930","4857690"," But I also think if we go up there."
"4858770","4861350"," That it's, it's a no brainer to."
"4862830","4866390"," It's, it's a no brainer to buy some cheap put there. "
"4881630","4884310"," Now trading above the one minute had two tests of the one minute."
"4893150","4894930"," Let's check the velocity real quick."
"4904890","4907130"," Our lease coming up from underneath right now. "
"4907410","4908790"," The velocity from underneath."
"4910190","4911430"," Is now at."
"4914810","4915370"," 40281. "
"4916690","4917650"," Let's look below."
"4918970","4921870"," This is why there's no, this is why there's no, um."
"4923610","4929410"," There's no big in, uh, in four or twos is because the velocity is coming up from underneath right"
"4929410","4929670"," now. "

"6641310","6642750"," Do you guys remember when is that Norman?"
"6642910","6644010"," Don't they used to say that shit. "
"6645350","6649990"," Where would you rather be right now to Jersey or New York and people would say or what's your worst"
"6649990","6652010"," place you've been to or something like that they could go."
"6652770","6656310"," Like spin his pen off table go New Jersey and spin the chair around."
"6671320","6673440"," Yeah Vicks I mean it looks like it wants to roll. "
"6674180","6678020"," This is a big so let's be honest right so."
"6679620","6683900"," Bulls are trying to let's be honest here what's going on so right now."
"6685120","6689700"," Bulls trying to squeeze this higher okay they want to get this fat squeeze higher. "
"6692260","6696740"," Meanwhile sellers are stepping in and they want to take this down to a minimum."
"6698040","6699160"," Of four oh two."
"6701520","6705800"," You got a bunch of bulls coming into the market and they're getting all bold up as Chase would say. "
"6707900","6712260"," And really what you want to see in here is everybody buying calls everybody dumping their puts."
"6713280","6716760"," And then they'll roll it down right so everybody's long as fucking here."
"6717580","6722980"," And they roll this market down to at least call it four oh four four oh five right now but"
"6722980","6724980"," four oh two fifty or four two ninety. "
"6725960","6731740"," Because the hourly is coming up it's it's coming up like it was started the morning started the"
"6731740","6736520"," morning down here and it's now trying to get back up here and provide some support to the market."
"6737040","6743560"," You know I'm looking at spy right now looks weak Vicks looks like it's on a bottom it smells like"
"6743560","6743920"," down."
"6745040","6746960"," That's what it smells like is we're going down. "
"6749420","6750480"," Let's see the spy."
"6752740","6755440"," The hourly is that four oh two fifteen."
"6757140","6762700"," You know sellers would like nothing nothing nothing more than to get down to four oh two if they"
"6762700","6762980"," can. "
"6763900","6769300"," Calls right now if you're along the market there's no reason for you to not have a hedge on the"
"6769300","6769580"," market."
"6770380","6772560"," They're dirt cheap they're fucking pennies."
"6772780","6778800"," I don't know why you wouldn't buy puts right now they're now they're four cents like four oh two's"
"6778800","6779340"," are four cents. "
"6779740","6783760"," You could throw like a hundred contracts at four oh two today and tomorrow."
"6784440","6788680"," And you're likely going to see it because there's a fair chance that you're going to see it."
"6789440","6794420"," And it like two cents four cents if they trade like thirty forty cents anything like that. "
"6795140","6801120"," It's it's gangbusters it prints a prince fat and huge so there's no reason not to take that trade."
"6801800","6807080"," Especially if you're long like if you have to for you to make up for sense and along should be"
"6807080","6807500"," easy."
"6809460","6811600"," So that's pretty much where we are in this market. "
"6811980","6813600"," It's a no brainer to take some puts."
"6814920","6818900"," Meanwhile we're bouncing around right we're down up down."
"6822480","6829100"," Just consolidation right people are going to say it's for a trip higher but truth is over today and"
"6829100","6831960"," tomorrow it's probably down to four oh two at some point. "
"6832720","6833500"," At minimum."
"6835660","6838260"," That minimum for two if not deeper."
"6844570","6847030"," Can we squeeze the four oh eight or four ten sure. "
"6848150","6850770"," I'm open to that as well that we could squeeze up there."
"6856710","6859890"," A smart man saying his discord is back up and running he's in Texas."
"6864870","6869010"," Yeah that four oh two is so if you're a bear you guys want to see what I'm talking I"
"6869010","6870770"," mean explain it in a better way for you. "
"6871590","6876530"," I was trying to talk to someone over the weekend about this and I didn't get a chance to so."
"6877250","6885230"," Let's look at spy real quick and see what's going on and the explanation behind this real quick."
"6886170","6886650"," So. "
"6888950","6890870"," Let's look at a 30 minute chart."
"6891490","6896910"," Canadian banks first quarter of 2023 provision and expense growth is offset rate benefit."
"6901260","6904180"," And I don't know I have no idea there it goes okay so. "
"6905760","6907720"," Let's look at this right here okay."
"6912760","6914940"," This is August let's just do a daily chart."
"6920150","6923750"," So what you so what you guys if you guys don't know what's going on in the background we're going"
"6923750","6924290"," to show it to you. "
"6927010","6928750"," So I want you to see this here okay."
"6932960","6935660"," So this here watch my follow my cursor okay."
"6936520","6937500"," So this up here. "
"6942170","6946450"," This is good for the bulls right bulls want to see them put on a different so why don't you"
"6946450","6947530"," guys will see this on a."
"6953720","6955360"," I want to show you the gap and go."
"6958100","6960480"," But the retest that takes place in here."
"6970110","6974610"," So we know if we're trading above this this is the this yellow line here is daily trigger. "
"6975110","6980810"," We'll tend to trade up down right go up and you can see us actually blast down to the hourly."
"6981630","6983890"," And then we're off and running for a period of time okay."
"6984870","6986470"," This is on the daily right here the daily trigger. "
"6986930","6990830"," So if you're a bull and you're like hey we're about to."
"6998280","7001520"," So if you're a bull and see how we're above this daily trigger right here."
"7002460","7007520"," Now we can blast down here too and not recover so I want to show you an example of that. "
"7009520","7014100"," And what takes place when we get underneath it so this would be the see I want you to see"
"7014100","7014800"," this one right here."
"7015680","7018280"," So this is the first leg down we come up right."
"7019280","7024400"," And it's literally like a bloodbath down underneath the daily we end up going to some pretty down"
"7024400","7025900"," depths is my point to you. "
"7025900","7028080"," So when we're up here right now."
"7029320","7032400"," And kind of see the same thing over here right sell it down."
"7032980","7037720"," Start hammering it then we bloodbath down and we're kind of right there right now. "
"7037720","7038600"," So you're looking like."
"7040300","7046360"," So just like letting the market breathe for a moment to this hourly and this daily trigger here."
"7046800","7048200"," Bulls really want to see. "
"7048800","7051160"," At least a retest of it right."
"7051160","7055920"," It confirms a significant."
"7057240","7063220"," It confirms the significant move higher over a period of time one to one month two months. "
"7064040","7065860"," Some pretty big highs up here."
"7066080","7068700"," There are bulls that are telling you no no no they're like."
"7069440","7073640"," I don't know we're just going to go to 460 today or some kind of nonsense like that. "
"7076060","7077820"," Can we squeeze up here today."
"7077820","7081840"," Sure we can squeeze up there you have failure to get a new high then we actually come back down"
"7081840","7084600"," and retest that daily back over here."
"7085620","7089840"," But I can assure you whether you believe this or not I can assure you that. "
"7091300","7096660"," These bears know that know that they want to see a retest of this daily and they actually want to"
"7096660","7097320"," get underneath it."
"7097640","7101080"," And actually reverse trend and continued trend down lower."
"7101240","7105560"," So that's why you're seeing that right here you're going to see these sellers stepping in. "
"7106760","7112600"," They want this you know they sell down come back up even if they get the extension and keep selling"
"7112600","7113080"," it down."
"7113760","7117860"," This is the natural place for bears to come into the market and try to sell that down."
"7118200","7121460"," Try to sell this down try to sell this down they don't care. "
"7122060","7126580"," They're going to sell it down until they're until their their stops are hit right."
"7127260","7131040"," So they're going to sell this right here if their stops are hit they'll let off and go long top"
"7131040","7131320"," here."
"7131580","7134080"," And they'll sell it again down here does that make sense. "
"7134080","7137640"," So and they don't want to see trend continue higher."
"7138240","7146220"," These bears are like what the bears don't want to see is the daily trend continue higher because if"
"7146220","7146620"," it does."
"7147420","7152180"," The bear case is over and truthfully the bullish move here is to defend. "
"7153440","7156600"," This daily trigger and make this leg higher."
"7156600","7160400"," So if you're a bear or if you're a bull you're like all right we already took this one here"
"7160400","7160880"," last week."
"7161360","7166100"," I want to re enter the trade again over here for these let these higher highs four twenty. "
"7166660","7167960"," Four thirty that kind of stuff."
"7168160","7171100"," I don't know if it happens today tomorrow or whatever."
"7171400","7176700"," So I want you to be aware like at least market awareness where the sellers are where I am as"
"7176700","7179220"," a as a like a real buyer I'm trying to be a buyer down here. "
"7180280","7183940"," Now if it takes time for the hourly and the daily to catch up here I'll be a buyer up"
"7183940","7184120"," here."
"7184120","7191500"," My buyer where I'm a buyer matters here right if it comes up I'll be that buyer up here if"
"7191500","7193240"," it stays down here for today or tomorrow."
"7193540","7199840"," I'm trying to be a buyer down here but trying to be a buyer here without buying some put protection"
"7199840","7201000"," is kind of crazy right. "
"7201500","7207520"," At any moment this market can reverse and roll lower here right so that's just so you can see"
"7207520","7208980"," what's happening right where we are."
"7208980","7217580"," So right in here sellers are coming in and they're saying no no and no the move is down"
"7217580","7222680"," and they have no their stops are up here."
"7222960","7229260"," This is where their stops are up here and they're going to stay short here until they get four or"
"7229260","7237580"," two minimum right and so the bulls need some need some velocity to break these sellers. "
"7238180","7245780"," So just looking at right here what is a bull need bull needs time for this velocity to push us"
"7245780","7254360"," higher and so that happens it's at 40250 I believe on the spy so let me take a look at"
"7254360","7255400"," a closer timeline here."
"7258040","7265920"," It's a 40206 right now 40206 is where this is where the smart money is smart money down here"
"7265920","7275780"," sellers above and really cheap puts so you know feel like thinking about what's going to"
"7275780","7276360"," happen here."
"7276360","7283660"," It's more there's a there's a high probability of there's high probability of these sellers"
"7283660","7293480"," allowing foamables to buy calls here and for the move to be down or"
"7293480","7302940"," having a beer a barrel plane right now to at least down here right 405 something like that they're"
"7302940","7309000"," really cheap right now puts our dude fucking puts our fucking four cents like I don't know how you"
"7309000","7314640"," don't buy them even if we are going higher you'll just burn the four cent puts or seven cent puts"
"7314640","7321380"," and say fuck it if we're going up then there's no reason not to have a hedge in the market"
"7321380","7330240"," right here and vix is on a bottom like everything's saying down here now if it's here at 406 or"
"7330240","7338880"," 408 a 410 I have no idea and my guess here is that you'll see 402 today or tomorrow at"
"7338880","7353110"," minimum you'll see it yeah"
"7353110","7360570"," winky it's somewhere I mean the thing here is that you short this right here you like short this"
"7360570","7370050"," right here right so I've got I've got a well I've got a long put on right here"
"7370050","7376790"," so unless we trade above it I've got no problems"
"7376790","7384670"," so cap owns puts here"
"7384670","7391950"," right and I'm trading calls up in here right so I own some calls here for a minute traded that"
"7391950","7399250"," up but you know until we get above it till we get above here the move is down right moves"
"7399250","7406370"," down to 405 404 something like that people are telling me well I'm long calls here and I'm like you"
"7406370","7415310"," got to buy some fucking put protection four or two is now trading five cents"
"7415310","7427400"," which is bullshit too they should be trading much much much higher at this point little"
"7427400","7445790"," bit of a bloodbath here in the spy 400 bulls"
"7445790","7451690"," want to see our bears want to see 400 actually not 402 bears want to see 400 they want to"
"7451690","7464600"," see a break of 400 exactly bulls want to be buying 401 402 it's actually"
"7464600","7477800"," coming higher right now roughly like 402 73 ish something like that sit"
"7477800","7486180"," not a little bit of support here in the 15 minute chart I don't think this is real though not"
"7486180","7495360"," 1247 at the moment there's a 15 minute chart right there sitting on a little bit of support right"
"7495360","7505340"," there leading off"

"7637920","7730990"," have wrote stock market crash It'd be like a number one hit on YouTube Alright"
"7730990","7735030"," a little bit of weakness the market here and we got a second fair plane on the day now it's"
"7735030","7739810"," fading below the crossover on the one and five minute make sure that you have some kind of way to"
"7739810","7748450"," protect yourself on the down side here Sellers strong in the market looking for 405 Make sure"
"7748450","7758090"," you're positioned properly in the market right now you have got free puts right now matter of fact"
"7758090","7764710"," they're making me money right now so here's a so here's the example so I bought puts this morning"
"7764710","7771430"," at seven cents right and when I took that call trade it paid for my puts so my puts they"
"7771430","7776930"," paid for my puts my puts don't actually have to even go back to seven cents so if they go"
"7776930","7782050"," to five cents I'm actually up three cents right now does it make sense so if they go to five"
"7782050","7790030"," six seven eight nine ten I'm making money right now I'm making money right now my puts even though"
"7790030","7797850"," I paid seven cents for them my calls bought my puts this morning so anywhere we go from like four"
"7797850","7803630"," cents three cents like three four cents and higher just making fucking free money at this point I"
"7803630","7813150"," will I'll get that bear disco ready"
"7813150","7821590"," you guys understand that concept so this morning right if you took calls in here the calls bought"
"7821590","7827210"," your puts right so I was up on my call trade up over the over the cost of my puts"
"7827210","7834190"," so let me explain it to you in a better way okay if I bought calls I bought puts let"
"7834190","7841390"," me get simple if I bought puts for ten cents okay and I bought calls for let's say thirty cents"
"7841390","7849710"," right let's say my calls went to fifty cents right"
"7849710","7859910"," so I made twenty cents right and I make ten cents profit right"
"7859910","7865030"," and then the other ten cents paid for my free puts now let's say the puts are going down let's"
"7865030","7870470"," say at that point the puts are at I don't know two pennies those are now two cents right they're"
"7870470","7877270"," worthless but then they come back to life right so let's say they go to point five cents right now"
"7877270","7882930"," I've made point three cents on them even though my calls are closed I've actually made three cents"
"7882930","7888390"," back on those puts I don't know if you can understand that logic but so right now I'm actually"
"7888390","7897870"," making money in puts right now on just the hedge the hedge is making me money right now so I"
"7897870","7906250"," have free puts just sitting in the market right here basically fucking free and I made money on the"
"7906250","7910970"," call side didn't make as much as I could have just been in calls but I had a safety net"
"7910970","7920800"," on the call side of this trade and they're now at five cents so"
"7920800","7930560"," hopefully we'll get some premium kick I love it I love having a good shitty Mondays turning"

"8748930","8750050"," It's not that it's for not rewarding. "
"8750070","8751730"," It's that you don't have time to get it done."
"8753950","8756490"," Spy now trading lower 40561."
"8756770","8758190"," Do I have to turn the music back on here?"
"8766420","8770740"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"8772500","8773740"," Blood in the markets."

"8882960","8885180"," me like, give me like 30 cents in those clips."
"8885420","8885800"," I'll be stoked. "
"8894970","8896610"," See if the bears can get it."
"8898390","8899950"," I think that was it right there."
"8900150","8901030"," I think that was the end of the song. "
"8904650","8906210"," I got a whole list of them."
"8906530","8916990"," We got some issues like I have a list of songs that I'm putting together, bulls, bears,"
"8917610","8919310"," sideways music when I'm on break music."
"8920130","8923230"," These things nobody can fuck with me in this stuff. "
"8923430","8927310"," I can't get a copyright strike ever on this stuff."
"8927310","8932390"," So as soon as we get that shit rolled together, package will have music for the stream for you"
"8932390","8932590"," guys."
"8942780","8944240"," We're working on it, I promise. "
"8947720","8949320"," Yeah, I'm kind of pissy right now."
"8949880","8951340"," They were six, seven cents."
"8951800","8952740"," There were some problems. "
"8954000","8958180"," There were some order, so there was some payment for order flow shit going on earlier."
"8959360","8963700"," This morning, we were going down and they were just, they weren't even moving, just same price."
"8964240","8968560"," They were asking me for eight cents for these puts, and I was like, what do you mean eight cents?"
"8969100","8971480"," I can see in the bid ask it's six, seven cents. "
"8972780","8974700"," So it's super fucking sketchy."
"8976240","8981180"," I don't know if it has anything to do with the internet being down in certain parts of the, maybe"
"8981180","8983980"," the country they're going to lie and tell you that was the reason, but whatever."
"8984460","8988000"," And they were so cheap that now I'll make some money. "
"8988160","8988620"," So I don't care."
"8988800","8998790"," I don't care if we go down went from"
"8998790","9003110"," 69 cents to 80 something cents."
"9003590","9006450"," So I'm happy here. "
"9006650","9008610"," And I'll put these on again tomorrow, too."
"9009550","9012690"," I think it like five cent puts or some shit for tomorrow."
"9013230","9013890"," No problem. "
"9013890","9014530"," Do it again."
"9014850","9015890"," I'll do it every day this week."
"9016730","9019690"," As long as puts are fucking five pennies done. "
"9027930","9028410"," Yeah."
"9028710","9032630"," So I've done like the DMC free on YouTube and it's a mixed bag."
"9032870","9034350"," I've been demonetized already. "
"9035230","9036330"," It's been a mixed bag."
"9036450","9037490"," I got it right now."
"9037550","9043450"," I'm only using the only things that I've gotten away with, even with citing artists is YouTube's"
"9043450","9045490"," music library. "
"9045490","9046670"," They're totally free."
"9047150","9049050"," And then YouTube just changed to a beta."
"9050130","9054230"," YouTube just changed this beta shit where they do some crazy shit. "
"9054230","9058530"," They're like, Hey, you can buy this song for a dollar and put it in your stream."
"9059710","9066510"," But oh, by the way, if if we ever don't renew that license, we're going to demonetize your old"
"9066510","9066810"," videos."
"9067810","9068890"," So I'm like, that doesn't work either. "
"9069710","9072050"," I'm like, I need a lifetime license for music."
"9072890","9080950"," So they have some lifetime music licenses, but the library is not vast."
"9081510","9087430"," But I do have like, I think I have right now 30 or 40 songs, maybe 50 or 60 that"
"9087430","9089710"," I have that were right kind of right there to do it. "
"9089990","9090470"," We're almost there."
"9094800","9095640"," Twitter's back to normal."
"9101480","9102400"," That's check and see. "
"9104840","9107280"," Let me just I just turned off Twitter."
"9107500","9111000"," I'm going to try to try to just do my normal bookmark and see if I can get in there."

"9114060","9114600"," Twitter back to normal."
"9119720","9121360"," See if we can get another cell here."
"9122680","9123720"," I might add some up here. "
"9124560","9126980"," If I can add some puts right here, I might add some puts."
"9130840","9131980"," See if we can get some more."
"9132960","9133560"," Let me check. "
"9133920","9136580"," I want to make sure that I might close them too."
"9136740","9143380"," Let me look on five in one minute or looking pretty bullish here."
"9145920","9149960"," And the hourly though is looking kind of weak and daily is kind of weak. "
"9150180","9151740"," So you could see a squeeze higher here."

"9183740","9186080"," One, two, three, and four. "
"9187400","9188060"," They're not the twins."
"9188340","9195880"," Looks like they looks like somebody fucked up and they ended up buying or they ended up having four"

"9233920","9235380"," That's the target down below guaranteed. "
"9236480","9238580"," It's not guaranteed but fairly certain."

"9254340","9256580"," I'll leave the broadcast out of course."
"9257480","9259400"," The new squawk is playing in the background."
"9259800","9260480"," Give me five minutes. "
"9260760","9263340"," I was supposed to check in with some people this morning and I didn't."

"9371340","9372760"," Darth Morley bros in the house. "
"9372760","9373920"," Good to see you, Darth Morley."
"9375040","9377060"," Mike Yasin has followed as well."
"9377440","9378580"," A 10 B10 has followed. "
"9378700","9380020"," I appreciate all the support out there, guys."
"9380780","9382520"," That was the past couple days there."
"9383460","9384980"," Past as wall has followed. "
"9385880","9388060"," And then David was 0425."
"9388400","9389980"," I appreciate all the follows out there."
"9390400","9391680"," That means the world to me. "
"9392480","9393660"," So thank you very much."
"9393680","9395680"," We're getting a lot of followers on Twitch right now."
"9396380","9397880"," So I'm very grateful for that. "
"9400880","9402460"," Oh, look at that, baby."
"9402460","9405020"," Look at that."
"9405220","9405940"," So I'll be right back. "
"9406220","9407360"," Give me just five minutes."
"9408100","9412540"," I'm going to have to make a couple quick phone calls and text to a couple people and try to"
"9412540","9414640"," catch up with them, make sure everybody's okay in the background."
"9415620","9418400"," We've got a winky doing a ton of work out there. "
"9418900","9421080"," And I got to make sure that he's that he's all set."
"9421980","9423180"," And I'll be right back."
"9427430","9432690"," Yeah, there's just so you know, if you don't know already, there are probably AWS issues all over"
"9432690","9433550"," the US right now. "
"9433850","9434830"," It impacted Twitter."
"9435050","9438570"," It meant maybe it's kind of a coincidence that it impacted Twitter."
"9438930","9442230"," But we also had issues with Spotify discord. "
"9443510","9446030"," Definitely payment for order flow was affected this morning."
"9446710","9449310"," You might want to even call your brokers on your own."
"9449310","9451390"," I'm going to call my broker today and be like, what the fuck?"
"9452450","9455770"," And find out because my pricing was wrong this morning. "
"9456210","9458450"," There's no fucking way that pricing was right."
"9459410","9461270"," And you're seeing it across different platforms."
"9462390","9464070"," So you probably haven't have a case. "
"9464690","9467530"," So I'm going to be like, I want a couple of pennies on this on these puts here."
"9472660","9473100"," Yeah."
"9473280","9475840"," So if you if Twitch is my Twitch was freaking out too. "
"9476120","9480160"," So I just refresh the page came right back like it was no big deal."
"9480440","9487640"," So you just might have an instance of Twitch from earlier this morning as as the AWS internet at"
"9487640","9494800"," large in the US was acting up, probably re patching and bypassing, pulling a plug here and pulling"
"9494800","9497860"," a plug there, charging a battery somewhere that they didn't charge."
"9507010","9513310"," Now trade is over for the bears if we trade above 406 19 and the one minute crosses above and"
"9513310","9514470"," price goes above there. "
"9520800","9522300"," You had to restart your browser."
"9522300","9560190"," Yeah, they're"
"9560190","9561650"," going to sell the fuck out of this right now."
"9561650","9563910"," Vix is claiming it's a one minute trigger right now. "
"9564050","9564950"," Be really careful out there."
"9566010","9567390"," Do not trust this."
"9568350","9570710"," Do not trust this squeeze right here. "
"9570770","9575030"," He's like a German government plans to ban some Huawei and ZTE parts."
"9575470","9579290"," The German government bans reply to mobile network operators again, according to sites."
"9579290","9589000"," And you guys, is the new squawk louder soft right"
"9589000","9589320"," now?"
"9596420","9598980"," Does anybody know if there is the new squawk?"
"9602480","9603420"," That's a good level. "
"9603440","9603920"," It's a little soft."
"9604360","9604520"," Okay."
"9606860","9612800"," I had to reset reset some stuff this morning and from there and they seem their levels seem to"
"9612800","9615220"," change here and there. "
"9621380","9623120"," I think I'm going to add some puts up here."
"9634490","9637090"," I'm going to see what happens here before I take a break alone."
"9643740","9645320"," I think I want to add some puts. "
"9646080","9664600"," I want"
"9666870","9669210"," to add some puts right here for tomorrow if I can."
"9684030","9685730"," Yeah, it's not my control level."
"9685870","9686150"," It's theirs. "
"9686690","9692670"," Well mine is fucked up because of what happened this morning, but theirs is all over the place"
"9692670","9693190"," every morning."
"9694530","9701230"," And then I've got a monitor on my end for the sound volume and it never seems to pick up"
"9701230","9711450"," the I'll"
"9711450","9712750"," leave that just like that for you."
"9712770","9713790"," I'll be right back in two minutes. "
"9721840","9725020"," And if anything happens, if anything happens, I'm sitting here."
"9725100","9726520"," I'm just going to be on the phone for a few minutes."
"9726520","9729340"," So I'll turn my mic back on if anything crazy happens. "
"10592540","10593840"," Blood, baby, blood."
"11002280","11003820"," All right, just heads up out there guys."
"11004260","11006580"," We are on the cusp of a bloodbath right here. "
"11006960","11015400"," This is just a warning, not guaranteed, but there is a risk of a pretty significant sell-off here."
"11017520","11020040"," Right on this H-line right here, just be really careful."
"11021260","11023420"," This could lead to a bloodbath in the market. "
"11023420","11029980"," I want you to look on a book map right now and just be hyper aware of it that we"
"11029980","11031580"," could go down and tag that 402."
"11032300","11034500"," That 402.50 we were talking about earlier."
"11034940","11036780"," Also, VIX is claiming the one minute. "
"11037220","11039740"," It's looking pretty fucking bullish to 1962."
"11040980","11042860"," Just be conscious of it as we're down here."
"11043660","11045380"," I could see some squeezing too. "
"11045780","11049440"," If we do squeeze up here for a minute, what I will end up doing is adding to my foot"
"11049440","11052240"," position and look for that bloodbath down here."
"11052240","11053740"," Just be conscious of it."
"11053940","11056680"," I'll be on there with you guys in just about three minutes. "
"11057320","11058700"," I'll be back with you in just a moment."
"11058760","11059180"," Okay guys."
"11464340","11465760"," All right, here I am. "
"11471850","11475350"," Talk about rating on that bull parade today."
"11475550","11476510"," How bull's on parade?"
"11477550","11479670"," Bull's getting all pulled up on Monday morning."
"11480230","11480930"," Now they're trapped. "
"11481470","11482270"," What are they going to do here?"
"11482970","11484930"," They got a double triple dog down now, right?"
"11486210","11487830"," What are the bulls going to do here?"
"11487990","11494690"," They're going to triple dog down back to the opening bell right now, actually trading below the"
"11494690","11500750"," opening price, going back to recheck the low at 404.75 right now."
"11505270","11509350"," All kinds of nonsense going on in the background this morning."
"11510230","11512870"," What's going on down here at 404.75?"
"11513170","11513850"," We're trying to check. "
"11516210","11517830"," There isn't much support there."
"11518010","11522210"," You can kind of see some buyers stepping in down here, trying to buy here."
"11522990","11524850"," They were not there just a moment ago. "
"11525070","11527610"," Some stink buys down below here."
"11528050","11537970"," See if the bulls can catch a dip buy at 404.75. They don't like paying right now, put side."
"11538950","11545050"," Put side is not paying right now, which is out of utter fucking bullshit that they're not paying"
"11545050","11545670"," the put side. "
"11545670","11549930"," I wonder if I should take the five cents and just make it a green day here."
"11550050","11555970"," If I just hold them like diamond hand them into the bell, maybe they trade up to like 20 or"
"11555970","11557190"," 30 cents at some point."
"11557430","11559970"," It'd be actually be a huge day for me if we did that. "
"11563130","11567190"," Yeah, dude, you see that with the puts?"
"11567470","11569410"," This is utter fucking bullshit on the put side."
"11572570","11573550"," It's utter bullshit."
"11574110","11575690"," It doesn't pay to be a bear. "
"11575690","11580470"," In the crazy part is, dude, I've been sitting in these things for like, how long now?"
"11580630","11581090"," What time is it?"
"11581930","11585970"," 2 o'clock in the afternoon and I've been sitting in puts all day long."
"11586210","11590130"," Went into some calls earlier today for a brief moment, working on my computer."
"11590410","11592250"," So I missed all that other bullshit over there. "
"11593310","11594710"," So I wasn't interested in it."
"11594770","11595410"," I was like, I'm not interested."
"11596090","11597330"," I don't care when they're going to sell this. "
"11597330","11598430"," I don't care if it's now later."
"11599970","11602250"," My puts are at five cents right now."
"11603170","11608070"," So I used to probably take some money here, but they're probably going to try to whittle them down. "
"11608230","11615230"," Oh, 402 piece."
"11615530","11616990"," Dude, I got to call my broker today."
"11617110","11619110"," This is I think something's up with the brokers. "
"11619770","11623650"," If I have to guess, this is a broker issue."
"11626050","11626490"," 100%."
"11631200","11637560"," So I just took, I just took the money off on 402 P at five cents. "
"11638180","11645280"," I'm very disappointed here, very disappointed here in, in the pricing in the market today in the"
"11645280","11645940"," options market."
"11646460","11648360"," This has to have something to do."
"11648580","11650040"," I don't know what else to say here. "
"11650140","11654500"," This is that they're trying to, they were trying earlier to get me to buy puts for eight pennies."
"11655760","11660660"," Above here, as a matter of fact, those puts have only gone up one penny in here."
"11661060","11662460"," That's utter fucking bullshit. "
"11662860","11665100"," So I've never seen that before."
"11666200","11666680"," Never."
"11667080","11668520"," So I'm going to try to find out. "
"11668920","11669620"," I'm going to call my broker."
"11670040","11675240"," I'll get you guys an answer as to what's going on this morning with the order flow."
"11675420","11680180"," My assumption is on the back end that they couldn't reset their order flow this morning. "
"11681040","11683260"," If I had, if I had an answer for you."
"11686420","11690440"," If I had an answer for you as to what's going on, this probably."
"11691980","11693300"," Oh, yeah, Perry. "
"11693780","11694200"," What's up."
"11695840","11697400"," Put that music on."
"11697800","11701580"," Put that music on, baby. "
"11702140","11704580"," Oh, everybody's all pulled up in here, huh?"
"11705640","11707160"," Oh, pulled up up here."
"11707980","11709260"," All pulled up."
"11716520","11717300"," No, I don't. "
"11717380","11718060"," I normally do."
"11718420","11718740"," I stopped."
"11720900","11724360"," I normally I normally do hedge with futures, but I stopped. "
"11725140","11726280"," I don't trade futures."
"11726640","11727200"," Well, I do."
"11727540","11728400"," I shouldn't say I don't. "
"11729320","11730500"," I get into a habit."
"11730720","11733680"," So Jill's asking puts don't pay, but they"
"11733680","11742160"," don't."
"11742160","11743420"," Shorting the market does pay. "
"11744140","11750080"," But what I find happening to myself is that I'm up all night long trading when I get into the"
"11750080","11752980"," habit of trading futures, I'm fucking trading it all the time."
"11754060","11758480"," So check my style of trading is I have a dip iron cash market."
"11759060","11762540"," And if I own the stock market, I will then hedge with futures. "
"11763000","11765160"," I have a large position or something overnight."
"11765880","11771240"," I will hedge with futures, but for me personally, I tend to just buy some puts if I can."
"11771500","11772600"," So I mean, they're paid. "
"11772720","11773140"," I made money."
"11773640","11775120"," I can't complain here."
"11775800","11777700"," I'm not I'm not stinky about it. "
"11777760","11778440"," I made money today."
"11778440","11779300"," So I'm happy."
"11779660","11779840"," I'm up. "
"11780020","11780980"," I'm very green right now."
"11781580","11786400"," I'm doing very well, but not as well as I could be doing."
"11786600","11786900"," Could I?"
"11787800","11793600"," Not as well as in futures, but I normally even put you see these puts pay at this point. "
"11794580","11798800"," So specifically for today, there's something wrong with the order flow."
"11799020","11799460"," I'll find out."
"11799600","11802240"," I'm going to I get straight answers for my guys that are tasty. "
"11802880","11803160"," I don't know."
"11803240","11806820"," I don't know if you guys call your brokers, but I'll negotiate."
"11807160","11811580"," So I have no problem calling and saying I know something happened in the background today. "
"11811580","11814120"," I got no problem asking them."
"11821100","11821780"," I've called."
"11822200","11824180"," This wouldn't be the first time that I've called. "
"11824620","11827420"," This wouldn't be the first time that I've gotten paid either."
"11827920","11829520"," Or I've said, Hey, what the fuck are you doing?"
"11830540","11836000"," My assumption here is that whatever took place across the internet probably impacted the order flow"
"11836000","11836860"," selling and buying."
"11837180","11840460"," Believe it or not, like I'm selling order flow buying order flow. "
"11840620","11845380"," That's I'm almost guaranteed here that almost guarantee in here that there's some real fuckery"
"11845380","11845940"," going on."
"11846860","11849560"," From AWS almost guaranteed."
"11851340","11861100"," Now, looking at the call side here, the 407 today had 373 75,000 call"
"11861100","11861520"," buyers. "
"11861680","11862960"," They got torch."
"11863820","11865860"," They were at like a dollar 80 or something."
"11866040","11867540"," They're now worth seven cents. "
"11867540","11871880"," And right now there is now on the put side."
"11872340","11878040"," There's a bunch of puts on 405 P for 72 cents that were not there earlier."
"11878660","11881860"," So there's now almost like a spread on the market on zero dates. "
"11882000","11886140"," There's a bunch of free asked 407 C's."
"11886860","11889540"," And now 73 cents."
"11890280","11890920"," Puts at 405. "
"11893640","11894240"," Unreal."
"11896760","11899200"," But Jill's asking a very valid question."
"11900120","11903260"," She's asking what so Jill Jill is asking this morning. "
"11904040","11905380"," Yeah, what's up STT Voyager."
"11906440","11911760"," Jill's asking a very important question is why are you not hedging futures instead of cash market"
"11911760","11912820"," normally."
"11913920","11916200"," The answer the answer is that normally. "
"11916520","11917580"," So H line got tagged."
"11918140","11919240"," We're good with that one."
"11919340","11923860"," We're going to look to see if we can sell off 40 506 or even down here. "
"11924360","11925980"," We'll see if we saw either of these."
"11927140","11929820"," And now normally that would have paid."
"11930280","11935660"," I think that normally this morning that there is an issue across the Internet, across the US. "
"11935660","11940000"," You saw it on Spotify, Discord, Twitter had issues this morning."
"11940760","11947280"," And even when I was at this this morning, I was trying to buy some puts and they were asking"
"11947280","11949120"," me they were like, can you pay eight cents for these."
"11949780","11950740"," And the bid ask. "
"11951580","11953960"," So this is in the order box like there's an order box."
"11954640","11957260"," And it was auto generating eight cents."
"11958180","11961400"," And then in the bid ask it was saying six and seven cents. "
"11961400","11965980"," And then we were having huge moves in the market and nothing was changing."
"11966720","11967960"," It just stayed constant."
"11970180","11976780"," So from my perspective, it's more than like more than likely some kind of a function of the issues"
"11976780","11977540"," in the Internet today. "
"11977740","11979720"," Now, even with that said puts don't pay."
"11982140","11985700"," You have to be in that trade all day long with exposure to the market."
"11986700","11987180"," Right. "
"11987320","11990840"," You're like sitting there and puts they're built for a hedge right not to make money."
"11991340","11995040"," So you sit there exposing yourself and puts and then they eventually pay end of day."
"11995380","11996600"," It's dangerous right. "
"11996840","11998200"," You're like you have to time it perfectly."
"11998820","12001180"," And you only get the payout after being exposed."
"12001820","12006240"," Whereas what Joe was saying was you could have just shorted that top back there and made some"
"12006240","12007120"," fucking good money. "
"12007820","12009220"," Shorting futures for myself."
"12009920","12012480"," When I trade futures, I never sleep."
"12012720","12014340"," I'm trading them all day every day. "
"12014900","12015820"," All night long."
"12016060","12016440"," No sleep."
"12016820","12017080"," No wife. "
"12017320","12017660"," No kids."
"12018360","12018860"," It's like crack."
"12019380","12020220"," For me at least. "
"12020660","12025100"," It's like if they had the stock market open 24 hours a day, it would be a challenge for me"
"12025100","12027480"," because you want to trade it like China does that right."
"12027640","12028340"," They have two sessions."
"12029740","12033100"," The two sessions thing for me is I can't do it, man. "
"12033860","12037500"," So only if I'm like long like a bunch of stock or something."
"12037820","12038380"," I'll wait."
"12038500","12040820"," I get I get I get woken up at nighttime. "
"12041780","12046260"," I think on the 20 or the first or second I got woken up at three o'clock in the"
"12046260","12048380"," morning with an alarm set on the market."
"12048740","12053160"," If we break these numbers, wake my ass up on ES so that you can short fucking futures."
"12056060","12064300"," So I am there with you trading futures, but not every day as as a as a as a how"
"12064300","12065860"," do I trade the market and I don't. "
"12066560","12067600"," I used to."
"12067700","12068160"," I don't anymore."
"12069320","12070900"," I got to get some sleep, man. "
"12071900","12075820"," Like futures does not help me sleep as if I was single I would."
"12076520","12079280"," If I was like single and had enough to answer anybody."
"12079720","12081720"," I would totally fucking trade futures. "
"12084000","12086480"," But for me, I'm like a junkie when it comes to the market."
"12087000","12088020"," I'm like, I just need more."
"12088760","12091340"," Just just let's just trade all the time. "
"12102640","12104620"," Yeah, I don't trade SPX either."
"12105020","12108900"," I make more money even after taxes with trading trade and spy."
"12109520","12111000"," I understand that whole argument. "
"12111200","12119960"," I just don't agree with it."
"12120380","12125680"," And the end of the risk to in the amount of money that I'm putting out there versus what I"
"12125680","12126140"," what I make."
"12127260","12129860"," So, no, but you know, I guess SPX puts would work. "
"12130620","12132560"," That's PX puts would pay very well."
"12133640","12137420"," But for the for dip buy and spy, I make great money doing that."
"12147860","12148460"," It's hard. "
"12149840","12154580"," You know, not Jill might have like Jill saying, she'll say it's hard to walk away from feuds, but I"
"12154580","12156440"," really leave runners overnight just for that reason."
"12157280","12159280"," You have good self discipline for myself."
"12159580","12161560"," I've had really bad self discipline trading futures. "
"12161900","12166440"," I mean, I think that shit is like it's like it's not crack, but it's."
"12168360","12173020"," When they say people when they when they have a term called pajama trader, do you know what why"
"12173020","12173860"," they have that term?"
"12174580","12179280"," People will tell you that they're not trading all the time, but I'm telling you what you meet some"
"12179280","12179900"," people out there."
"12179920","12180580"," They'll tell you the truth. "
"12180660","12184560"," The truth is that for a lot of traders, once they start trading futures."
"12185400","12187000"," They'll fucking trade it all the time."
"12187320","12191640"," You know, you can walk right away from the computer monitor, and then you're like right back at it. "
"12191700","12193360"," You're like, oh, I had a bear to whiskey."
"12193680","12194460"," Let's go trade some futures."
"12195700","12196940"," So I try not to. "
"12198620","12199420"," I do."
"12199540","12200140"," I try not to."
"12204710","12205490"," Future Z equals. "
"12205690","12210370"," So John Hager is saying future zigos where I make more money than options of a long term equity"
"12210370","12211190"," holds on the best."
"12211190","12220250"," Yeah, if I look back over five or 10 years, I've made my most safest trades have been in that"
"12220250","12221890"," inequities holding equities."
"12223050","12225510"," My second best trade is spreads. "
"12226970","12229830"," The second best trade is spreads for sure."
"12230730","12232050"," Most consistent with that."
"12232350","12234450"," And then the day trading is a mixed bag. "
"12235710","12240650"," I've done very well with it, and I've blown a lot of shit up doing that weekly day trading."
"12246320","12249360"," Yeah, trading when you've had some whiskey is what the crypto market is for."
"12255390","12256730"," The future is on ambient. "
"12259410","12264170"," Yeah, you know, you know, it's just talking to Joe donut the other day, and he was on his phone."
"12264810","12267410"," I can't believe how many people I do you would be you would be."
"12267910","12270110"," I don't know with shocked you people would be, but. "
"12270990","12273490"," I know a ton of people that trade on their phones."
"12273890","12275170"," I know people that trade just in their laptop."
"12275890","12278690"," Like just I got a laptop out and I bounced back and forth. "
"12279470","12283630"," Like the moment I went to multi screen trading, I'll never go back."
"12283950","12286790"," Like if I lose power or something I'll try to close the trade out."
"12287430","12290870"," I'm like if I'm long or short something or if I'm. "
"12291590","12295950"," If my power internet goes down, I'll immediately if I'm in the money, try to close."
"12297550","12301790"," I feel like I feel like I missed out or I feel like I'm handicapped if I don't have."
"12302930","12305450"," Three, four, five, six screener's going all at once. "
"12305850","12306910"," Like that's the other side of it."
"12311940","12312640"," People do it."
"12312740","12314020"," I know lots of people that train their phone. "
"12316360","12317560"," I'm shocked at that."
"12318240","12319120"," I couldn't do it."
"12319340","12320680"," I can't but people do it all the time. "
"12330300","12332580"," Let me take a look around the market and see where we're at real quick."
"12335740","12341860"," Spy still has that target down below 40257 for Spy."
"12342040","12343360"," This isn't a fake sell. "
"12343580","12344300"," This is a fake buy."
"12345540","12348340"," The target down below remains right here for sure."
"12349320","12353940"," If you see a squeeze higher real quick, maybe we can make that low down there. "
"12354180","12356900"," So I'm still on wanting to take this trade right here."
"12357760","12358840"," Some puts for tomorrow."
"12359120","12359740"," I did close out. "
"12359740","12360920"," I'm flat right now the market."
"12361600","12366140"," But I am looking for this trade down here in the close."
"12374000","12375140"," Yeah, you had with the underlying. "
"12375600","12376700"," Yeah, that makes sense too."
"12382960","12386920"," Yes, Lottie Brantfly is saying he's always been on his phone for three years."
"12387180","12387880"," I get that too. "
"12388340","12392620"," I'm not I'm not in no way shape or form my saying it's the worst way to trade."
"12394520","12397000"," The thing that I tell people is if you trade on your phone."
"12398120","12400840"," What I always tell people is if you trade on your phone, right?"
"12401620","12406260"," You should if you have if you at least have a desktop or a laptop or here, let's do the"
"12406260","12406560"," baseline. "
"12408160","12409040"," Let's do the baseline."
"12409660","12410520"," You can get on eBay."
"12411100","12411960"," Get yourself a desktop. "
"12412340","12414480"," They're like 85 bucks 125 bucks."
"12415140","12417680"," Someone mentioned earlier about a bloatware removal tool."
"12419660","12424640"," You can actually get I use these tools all the time for I turn desktops into NAS servers. "
"12425940","12430100"," And I run these so I'll get like an old computer that's running like Windows 10."
"12431580","12435280"," Windows 8 or something and I'll run this bloatware tool on it."
"12435360","12436580"," It rips everything out of the computer. "
"12437760","12441400"," Except for what you need to be on the Internet."
"12441920","12445180"," Have a web page open and be on the Internet."
"12445780","12447220"," Those computers are like a hundred bucks. "
"12447620","12448120"," You can get them on eBay."
"12448820","12453860"," So you get that computer you get yourself a and then the crazy part is you just you drive your"
"12453860","12455040"," ass down to your local."
"12456460","12458020"," I don't know like a salvation army. "
"12458720","12462020"," And you grab yourself like four or five monitors shitty ones."
"12462100","12463320"," You don't need to get something nice."
"12463320","12467240"," Like I got I got monitors here that cost me two three hundred bucks a pop, right?"
"12467480","12469440"," They're not expensive, but you get enough of them. "
"12469620","12470280"," They're expensive."
"12471880","12478640"," But like travel monitors, but you can go to like salvation army and grab like I don't know a"
"12478640","12480200"," monitor for like 10 or 15 bucks."
"12481420","12484400"," Get some shitty old flat screens that have an HDMI port on them. "
"12487050","12489070"," And you can hook them up to the back of that desktop."
"12489810","12494230"," Matter of fact, if you get a desktop or a laptop with a C port on it, you can get"
"12494230","12494370"," it."
"12494470","12496450"," You can actually buy on Newegg or something. "
"12496550","12497210"," They have these."
"12497210","12504730"," And these like it's like a little box that you can plug in multiple monitors and it'll push it"
"12504730","12506190"," right off into your computer."
"12506830","12511950"," So like Windows 11, if you upload a Windows, I guess you can't do this with Windows 10, but Windows"
"12511950","12513090"," 10, you can get three monitors. "
"12514190","12518610"," So you get a couple of desktops or a couple fucking laptop laptop and a desktop."
"12519470","12520490"," Get yourself some shitty monitors."
"12520490","12529450"," Probably run you three, four, five hundred bucks max and set it up for yourself so you can see what"
"12529450","12531010"," everybody's talking about. "
"12531190","12537770"," Because if you're watching like the VIX, if you're watching HYG, you're bouncing around all the"
"12537770","12545910"," sectors of the S&P 500, if you've got, we can't use Twitter following more, but tweet deck, you can"
"12545910","12547530"," just type in the ticker that you like."
"12548550","12550330"," And it'll you can do it."
"12550550","12557750"," You can actually do like a Twitter fall ass type thing that will search keywords so you can watch"
"12557750","12559830"," where people what the sentiment is in the market. "
"12561030","12566030"," The White House says that we will have something in the near future on the Fed Vice Chair nominee."
"12566910","12567950"," It's like life changing."
"12568370","12571150"," When you have multiple monitors, man, it changes how you trade. "
"12572390","12574990"," It's definitely for me at least it was a game changer."
"12578650","12580070"," Definitely a game changer for me."
"12589220","12592820"," Yeah, I want to add some puts up here if I can somewhere up in here if I can add"
"12592820","12593580"," some puts I will. "
"12595060","12596380"," Just squeezing real quick."
"12598700","12600580"," I don't think we're done on the downside here."
"12603140","12604380"," Maybe if we can. "
"12606480","12607540"," Let me look on."
"12608160","12612660"," I mean, we're looking bullish right now in the one and five minute, but the hourly is still dog"
"12612660","12613020"," shit."
"12614600","12616780"," Early is still still crap right now. "
"12617060","12620200"," So, I mean, you could easily see some."
"12620400","12620780"," Oh, wait a minute."
"12621420","12623420"," You could easily see something like this here. "
"12623900","12625460"," This is not a bad place to take a trade."
"12626320","12626820"," A call trade."
"12628160","12630100"," I may be looking for something just like this. "
"12630100","12634300"," This is what I'm looking for right now."
"12634480","12635400"," This is my expectation."
"12636720","12638000"," Is something like this. "
"12641820","12642760"," Something like this."
"12647820","12652140"," Something like this price come up here and then immediately fail into the bell here."
"12652880","12653800"," Something like that. "
"12653940","12654680"," That's what I'm looking for."
"12655420","12657660"," Add some add some puts right in here tomorrow."
"12660100","12663080"," So you can take a sip of that if you want. "
"12665600","12668020"," And take a step so you can see it."
"12668460","12669020"," There is it."
"12669080","12670200"," There is an upside trade here. "
"12671060","12675620"," I don't know if it sells in the red line here if it climbs above because the one and five"
"12675620","12676320"," minute are bullish."
"12677120","12678240"," And it's two 14."
"12678660","12684160"," So the next 15 minutes, maybe next 15 minutes should be should be kind of bullish. "
"12687860","12690740"," And then I'm going to hope for the bears to take it over again at two 30."
"12716090","12716790"," There you go."
"12716910","12721050"," Jeff and I was saying you can split a monitor to four screens by dragging wind to each corner of"
"12721050","12721170"," it. "
"12721510","12722630"," Thanks, Jay, for saying that."
"12723830","12724630"," So there you go."
"12724750","12725210"," One monitor. "
"12726010","12727010"," It's problem solved."
"12729170","12734010"," You can just put your keep your monitor but make four screens on it so you can see everything."
"12739060","12745600"," I keep a or not anymore, but I used to keep a window open with Webull on its own and"
"12745600","12747120"," I had all the tickers. "
"12747120","12756220"," I had like XLF, XLU, and then I had HYG and VIX all up on one chart."
"12757280","12761580"," So like you can split the charts on Webull, you know, I just use that as a screener in the"
"12761580","12762660"," background so you can see."
"12763280","12769240"," Because sometimes you can see divergences on HYG and the SPY. "
"12769440","12774160"," And if you're trading an individual ticker, you can you can apply all that stuff to generally not"
"12774160","12775880"," always, but you can apply like cues."
"12775880","12783560"," To the ticker that's the to the tech ticker that you're trading and that kind of stuff."
"12787430","12790570"," So I like the window manager in Windows 11. "
"12791390","12795230"," The problem that I have with it right now is that it's auto."
"12796530","12801370"," It's auto trying to so whenever I remove a monitor now."
"12802230","12804470"," Like so I just removed the monitor this morning. "
"12804470","12810430"," When I put the new monitor on, it streamlabs reset all my volume stuff."
"12811290","12818710"," And then I had preset monitor resolution sizes and now it's all fucked up."
"12818850","12820150"," I got like res. "
"12820370","12827010"," So you in Windows 11 you can set each resolution each screen so you can like I need each screen"
"12827010","12830510"," to look differently for how I'm broadcasting them and then how I'm interacting with them."
"12831250","12833530"," So I can get more or less information on them."
"12834690","12839810"," And now it's all fucked up because and then I'm my my my my levels and what's my microphone on"
"12839810","12839990"," this. "
"12840390","12842690"," What's my desktop audio on that screen."
"12842990","12845670"," What's my desktop audio on that screen."
"12846010","12849050"," All kinds of different shit and then I'm pumping in another. "
"12849750","12852330"," I've got other computers here that are working."
"12852750","12855830"," So like when you see book or when you see book map up in this screen right here."
"12855830","12857950"," When you see book map up here right. "
"12858310","12859610"," That's from its own computer."
"12860370","12864130"," And it gets pumped into my streaming computer."
"12864530","12869430"," So all that work that book map needs to do gets done on a separate unit and then it's just"
"12869430","12872830"," pumping out a video basically a video to you guys. "
"12885340","12886820"," Dude I just had a Windows."
"12887080","12890740"," I just I have a I have a desktop that I'm working on right now."
"12890740","12899240"," It's on Windows 7 and it's funny because on startup you can see all of the requests that are made. "
"12900600","12904260"," To the Internet you can see like what it's asking the Internet for."
"12904860","12907860"," And if you run that same test on a Windows 11 machine."
"12908980","12910720"," Versus a Windows 7 machine. "
"12911620","12914660"," It's like night and day night and day like."
"12914660","12919740"," Like you guys you guys may or may not know this but when you start up like a Windows 10"
"12919740","12920780"," or Windows 11 machine."
"12922520","12923660"," You don't even have a choice. "
"12923880","12930860"," It sends out a bunch of your shit to advertising companies to data collection companies."
"12931460","12933600"," And you can see the requests going out."
"12934420","12939400"," I'll try to I'll try to find a video on it and send it to you happening like when you"

"12940340","12942840"," When you go to like XP there's no requests."
"12943140","12946240"," It's like one or two small requests to Microsoft and that's it."
"12959590","12960610"," Hey David G."
"12965720","12969140"," You got that just down below there just hanging out. "
"12973450","12977730"," Thoughts on CVix today who's asking that I missed that I'm sick on six today."
"12978770","12990920"," Let me take a"
"12990920","12990920"," look."
"12990920","12997000"," What's that's a CIX comp X international anybody know what their market cap is. "
"12998060","12999660"," Looks very squeezy."
"12999740","13000480"," I'll tell you that."
"13001040","13002540"," Looks crazy squeezy. "
"13004420","13006060"," Price needs to get above."
"13007700","13008220"," 1959."
"13010680","13012500"," 1959 very low liquidity. "
"13013040","13016340"," If it gets above nineteen fifty nineteen forty eight it'll start squeezing."
"13018620","13020420"," Let me look up what its market cap is."
"13029080","13035850"," I don't want to comment on anything that's under a certain amount of market cap. "
"13037010","13038310"," Because I don't know if you're holding."
"13044750","13046170"," I want to make sure you're not holding."
"13046470","13047530"," It's fairly good. "
"13048270","13049310"," Two billions not bad."
"13050290","13051110"," We can look at it."
"13054960","13060500"," I don't want to mess with anything that's like hundred and fifty million market cap. "
"13061180","13064800"," I don't want to I don't want to be I don't want to I don't want to be mess with"
"13064800","13067500"," anything where I could have impact the float."
"13073000","13074300"," It's looking squeezy."
"13075420","13076800"," This is CIX. "
"13086140","13088400"," Could be squeezy from eighteen eighty four."
"13088940","13091720"," But it looks like it's going to it's looks like it's going to get murdered here."
"13092380","13093740"," So I'll be honest with you. "
"13093840","13094740"," I don't know what I think about six."
"13095020","13096320"," I'll tell you exactly what I think about it."
"13097860","13101100"," I think it trades to nineteen twenty and then blood baths. "
"13102620","13103420"," That's what I think."
"13105640","13109780"," Blood baths the seventeen and then probably blood baths again down even lower."
"13114180","13116200"," Retest these lows at sixteen dollars. "
"13116360","13117380"," Yeah, short the fuck out of it."
"13120260","13122960"," The could squeeze higher if it gets above."
"13128530","13130130"," If it if it holds. "
"13135660","13138580"," If it holds nineteen sixty."
"13143580","13147900"," You're going to like some getting weird if it holds this possibly a trade there."
"13149000","13151140"," But what do I think about six I think it's a short. "
"13152680","13153940"," It would need to get above."
"13154260","13155460"," It would need to get above."
"13157440","13160120"," Nineteen sixty and more than likely above twenty bucks. "
"13161960","13164820"," I wouldn't even consider a long unless it was above twenty."
"13166320","13167160"," Somewhere in there."
"13168660","13170160"," Let's even raise up a little bit more. "
"13170320","13172820"," I want to see consolidation for the move higher."
"13173080","13176580"," But in all honesty it's probably looking like it wants to get down to like sixteen dollars."
"13177360","13181100"," I know nothing about the ticker so I have nothing to comment on with. "
"13182540","13185580"," I have nothing to comment on with its fundamentals."
"13186700","13188980"," Any news any of that kind of stuff."
"13192320","13193980"," Could even go lower than sixteen. "
"13197200","13199960"," Very dangerous ticker to be trading."

"13261020","13261880"," I guess that's my answer."
"13276160","13279400"," Oh you want to see VIX not not six VIX."
"13281640","13283720"," You want me to look at the VIX for you. "
"13284580","13286120"," I'm like six I don't know man."
"13289220","13290840"," So you want me to do the VIX."
"13291560","13295620"," All right I want a super chat for sixty nine cents for that for having to do the VIX next. "
"13297240","13301060"," I want I want the fucking if you want me to do the VIX I want sixty nine cents donated"
"13301060","13301780"," right now."
"13312630","13314470"," David I'm just fucking with you David."
"13322230","13323670"," Okay so let's look at the VIX. "
"13326330","13332450"," I'm like what the fuck is six fucking comp X what the fuck is going on."
"13332450","13333250"," What's going on with that ticker."
"13339310","13340370"," David's a stock pumper. "
"13340550","13341950"," Watch out for that guy in the in the chat."
"13342090","13343370"," Make sure you put a label on him."
"13346050","13347310"," Okay so we're going to do the VIX. "
"13351830","13353190"," So we're on the one minute of the VIX."
"13355670","13357330"," VIX trying to pull its pants up."
"13358530","13362850"," VIX is trying to trade to VIX is trying to tell us what I want to show you guys. "
"13362850","13367010"," Okay let me move something over so let's look at the VIX together."
"13368470","13369750"," So this is what I want to show you."
"13370390","13375590"," Do you see how the daily on the VIX the bars are getting lower. "
"13376370","13377890"," They're going to start to turn up here."
"13378270","13378630"," You see that."
"13379430","13380110"," I want you to see that. "
"13381410","13384590"," See how the hourly is starting to move like this."
"13385650","13388790"," So the hourly is telling you that it's more bullish does that make sense."
"13389990","13394190"," So right now you're seeing the five minute is weak. "
"13394910","13395050"," Okay."
"13396310","13400250"," And the one minute is strong starting to get strong but it's still kind of weak."
"13401230","13405910"," So if you're like seeing some of this kind of stuff here what it's telling you is that the VIX"
"13405910","13406890"," is starting to bottom. "
"13407910","13408350"," Okay."
"13408970","13414370"," It doesn't mean that the VIX is going up here and nothing like that but it's implying that there's"
"13414370","13417190"," a bottoming happening in the VIX at least in the one minute."
"13417190","13417670"," Okay. "
"13418590","13427150"," So there's there's some bottoming action here and to expect it to squeeze up at least to 19 least"
"13427150","13431730"," to 19 even if it's rolling over here right now this is more like consolidation."
"13432950","13436970"," So the VIX is going to be looking for a tag at least."
"13437870","13439470"," Let's call it 19 bucks. "
"13440010","13442330"," Hey, 19 dollars looking for 19 dollars."
"13443550","13445290"," If it's able to get above."
"13447470","13447990"," 1911. "
"13449390","13451670"," It's next target is pretty pretty high up there."
"13452270","13453050"," It's 20."
"13453890","13454650"," 20 bucks. "
"13455050","13455350"," Hold on a second."
"13456930","13459770"," That's next target higher and VIX is 20 bucks flat."
"13460810","13461870"," So 19 to 20. "
"13462730","13463930"," And then above that."
"13464930","13466370"," We get the fun times right."
"13467590","13469570"," I guess not fun times yet. "
"13469850","13472710"," Next one is at 2180 down here."
"13473610","13474870"," 2160, 2140."
"13476750","13483290"," And then above that we've got 2180 down here and we're going to go over this on a higher time"
"13483290","13484210"," frame so you can see it. "
"13485730","13488130"," That's 2180 and then the 15 minutes."
"13489410","13491330"," Let's take a look at this in the 15 minutes."
"13492710","13498080"," And you can kind of see the VIX is trying here right. "
"13499420","13503920"," So the VIX is going to try to come up try to come up try to come up right maybe"
"13503920","13505200"," get sold down here."
"13505980","13507160"," The 17 bucks."
"13508820","13512320"," If the VIX is able to get above $24 it's on. "
"13513320","13517760"," Okay, so if the VIX gets up here starts to consolidate at 2150 or so."
"13518400","13522560"," It's going to get violent and above the red line here is where bear town is right here."
"13523260","13529680"," I'm going to assume that this is 398 or so when VIX is up there at that level. "
"13531220","13535320"," So currently in the moment VIX is a little it's kind of weak on the one and five minute."
"13535780","13537080"," But on the hour."
"13537660","13542860"," So between like 230 to 330 to 430 to 430 it's gaining momentum to the upside. "
"13543640","13546040"," Okay, so VIX is gaining momentum to the upside."
"13546620","13549880"," So how does that translate to us here on the spy."
"13549880","13554900"," It translates to the spy having a good 15 minute runner cell right. "
"13555520","13559340"," Trying to see the spy trying to regain itself trade higher."
"13559900","13564180"," And then in the early comes into play it's going to try to sell itself off into this bell over"
"13564180","13564360"," here."
"13564920","13565720"," Does that make sense. "
"13566820","13574340"," So the path looks like something like this on the spy in relation to the VIX release right now."
"13577940","13580280"," So how how do we get here I have no idea."
"13580280","13584880"," I'm assuming that we're going to get a move lower at some point. "
"13585080","13587200"," How about this I'll pause it to you."
"13588360","13591500"," That as we head into the close today."
"13592940","13593980"," I'll pause it. "
"13594580","13596960"," That there'll be a place to take another short."
"13607880","13609080"," I got to David brother."
"13612040","13613720"," No, I think we're going up here. "
"13614100","13615420"," I think you got a I think you have a."
"13616320","13617360"," It's now two twenty nine."
"13618000","13618600"," We have an hour."
"13618920","13621180"," We'll find out if we're going to get bulls for an hour here or not. "
"13621960","13624660"," How long it lasts if it's a bull trap or not."
"13624780","13627660"," I think it's a bull trap so far it looks like a bull trap."
"13629700","13633460"," Looks like some kind of trap above for bulls to get themselves all wound up into. "
"13635380","13637240"," We know where the market is short right now."
"13637980","13638260"," Right."
"13638460","13639880"," We know that the market is short right here. "
"13642300","13644020"," We know where that's where the market is short."
"13645440","13647820"," You know currently this is where market is short above."
"13648900","13650440"," There's another box right here. "
"13651780","13655580"," But I call these the weak sellers like these are the weak sellers right here."
"13657280","13658660"," Maybe I'll turn that to red."
"13660500","13662360"," We'll make these the swellers right. "
"13663320","13664140"," So there you've got."
"13664920","13665660"," This is what you get."
"13665720","13666480"," You have the swellers. "
"13669080","13672080"," And this is where the weak sellers are."
"13682680","13683480"," They're right there."
"13712420","13713580"," And I sold my put. "
"13713780","13715080"," So we'll just write big."
"13715580","13715980"," Swellers."
"13719680","13723520"," This is where Mero is if you guys any guys know Mero he's right up here. "
"13724600","13726000"," That's where Mero is right up there."
"13760760","13762640"," I don't trade you the XY anymore."
"13763560","13764520"," I think it's broken. "
"13765140","13765860"," I don't bother."
"13769760","13771020"," Nice Powell tapestry."
"13771240","13773320"," I'm going to do a tapestry on. "
"13773900","13775540"," I think I'm doing it on Tom Lee."
"13775700","13776360"," I haven't done it yet."
"13776480","13779060"," But I'm going to do a Tom Lee painting next. "
"13779300","13780560"," My daughter made that for us."
"13781200","13785660"," I'm going to ask her to do a Tom Lee."
"13787200","13787740"," Tapestry. "
"13787800","13788980"," W two, I crude April."
"13789080","13791120"," Future said that $80 and 46 about."
"13791480","13793340"," It's up 78 cents or spot nine. "
"13793340","13793920"," Eight percent."
"13794380","13795140"," I'll mix gasoline."
"13795600","13797620"," April features selling at $2 and 79. "
"13798200","13800700"," Well, these were April features selling at $2 and 88."
"13804650","13805650"," Oh, is he really?"
"13807150","13809650"," Is he trolling bulls on Twitter right now?"
"13810730","13811510"," That's hilarious."
"13813810","13815730"," I love when he chose bulls on Twitter. "
"13815730","13819230"," I find that hilarious."

"13836050","13837050"," Congrats to them too."
"13837230","13840770"," I had friends that were like, I had friends that were like, I'm long fucking calls into Monday."
"13840870","13843290"," And I'm like, Oh, I was like, I'm fucking flat. "
"13843290","13847410"," I mean, I think we figured on."
"13847830","13848810"," I think it's still here."
"13851050","13852010"," Yeah, right there. "
"13852450","13853090"," So this is the."
"13855030","13857210"," I think I wrote this on Friday for you guys."

"13860630","13861390"," We did gap up."
"13861630","13862450"," We gapped up actually."
"13862730","13864750"," I don't know if this is showing futures, but. "
"13865890","13867950"," We gapped up at least today at some points."
"13867950","13869130"," Now you're seeing that."
"13870490","13871630"," Oh, that path point. "
"13871750","13873510"," It's not exactly what everybody's pretty fucking good."
"13875170","13876610"," If you guys are thinking what I'm thinking."
"13878390","13881070"," If you guys are thinking what I'm thinking, I'm thinking that right there. "
"13881690","13882570"," I'm thinking that."
"13883430","13884370"," I'm thinking that."
"13885570","13887190"," I'm thinking that we're kind of weak. "
"13889150","13891030"," Probably up high somewhere up in here."
"13891670","13894190"," You know, something like this and then we get into the powerful shit."
"13894970","13896370"," And then we have that one brief moment. "

"13954500","13955980"," This is where I think we park it."
"13955980","13964040"," I think we park Powell's speech right there."
"13964960","13965880"," It's a good place. "
"13966980","13968720"," We'll be parked right down in there."
"13969760","13970940"," Into Powell's speech."
"13971200","13972320"," It gives plenty of room. "
"13973240","13975520"," Plenty of room for some death and destruction."
"13976700","13978320"," Nice bloodbath right there."
"13979340","13981140"," Gives plenty of room for a rip higher. "
"13982520","13984760"," Looks like some books about what's right."
"13984880","13989900"," Probably the options market will be will be, you know, priced in somewhere in here."
"13989900","13991560"," This looks logical to me. "
"13992660","13993780"," Somewhere down in here."
"13995720","13997020"," Well, into tomorrow."
"13997640","13998280"," I got maybe not. "
"13998520","13999480"," Maybe we maybe we fucking."
"14000080","14001240"," I could be wrong."
"14001640","14002660"," I mean, I know I could be wrong. "
"14002780","14003480"," I've been wrong a lot."
"14003720","14006460"," So I guess bulls are saying that."
"14007400","14008700"," No, no, I don't want it. "
"14008800","14009320"," I fell streams."
"14010260","14011180"," I'm not trying to watch."
"14012240","14013320"," Wait, what happened there?"
"14017660","14018740"," I guess if you're. "
"14020060","14021440"," A bull you think."
"14024660","14026800"," We should be here for the Powell's speech, maybe."
"14028640","14030940"," Like we park it right here for the Powell's speech at 410. "
"14031700","14032560"," I don't know."
"14035280","14037140"," I don't think that's where it's at."
"14037600","14040680"," I think I think I think you've seen a hedge come on the market above here. "
"14042460","14044680"," And I think they'll rehedge it here."
"14044880","14046080"," I think they'll rehedge it here."
"14046640","14049140"," I think bulls have going to have a hard time fighting this. "
"14049140","14052580"," And then it'll it'll squeeze higher."
"14054180","14057120"," Unless unless we get bad news from J."
"14057280","14059700"," Now we're going to have a bloodbath in our hands."
"14067240","14069200"," It was the last message that you sent. "
"14073140","14073660"," Wait."
"14084060","14085640"," So wait till you see the."
"14086640","14089380"," So we're on this last little line of support here. "

"14140190","14141550"," generation by 2050. "
"14142310","14147530"," You have to realize too, like you got if you're a bear out there, you have to realize something."
"14149110","14153170"," You're not going to have like you can't nominate somebody to be the Fed president."
"14153530","14155850"," Like here, we're going to nominate this guy is the Fed president. "
"14155850","14162490"," And then put him in front of the Senate and destroy his reputation."
"14164070","14171190"," I need you to understand that you're you have to understand these people are in professions, right?"
"14172950","14177070"," That's you like if I'm a senator and you're the Fed chair president or whatever."
"14179110","14180990"," Unless you're doing something heinous. "

"14202750","14204870"," Like that's not going to happen. "
"14206310","14207590"," What the bears need."
"14208070","14211010"," You might get like shitty questions at the end of the Senate hearing."
"14211690","14216830"," What bears need though is bears need like a surprise rate hike during the Senate hearing. "
"14217350","14219430"," They need they need power to come out and be like, fuck it."
"14219510","14221630"," We're going to raise another 50 BPS right now."

"14234490","14235570"," That's what a bear wants."
"14236050","14239470"," Like you'll get some volatility from from the stupid questions after the end of the day. "
"14240750","14244010"," But that could be assigned to weakness in the market later in the day tomorrow."

"14261530","14263890"," You're going to get it from James Jerome himself."
"14265670","14266750"," That's where you get that."
"14267010","14268210"," That's where you get that out that. "
"14268210","14271390"," Not volatility, but that's where you would get the blood bath."
"14279710","14282690"," I wonder if I should take this trade here, this call trade here."

"14331740","14332960"," They're they're they're scam artists, man."
"14333000","14335740"," Like the the Fed and the Paul."
"14336180","14337800"," It's all about power and money. "
"14338040","14338920"," It's what it's all about."
"14339240","14340300"," And they're all buddies and friends."
"14341220","14342600"," And you guys elect all these people. "
"14343720","14346200"," And I don't care if you guys are Republicans or Democrats."
"14347300","14348320"," You fuckers go."
"14348320","14349860"," You guys go to the. "
"14350120","14351360"," Some of you say you vote."
"14351500","14354680"," You just let eighty six dollars and eighteen cents a barrel up."
"14354880","14357300"," Thirty five cents or zero spot for one percent. "
"14358220","14360480"," Some of y'all out there are claiming that you vote."
"14360640","14362900"," But instead you get out on the Internet and just wine and bitch."
"14363860","14369040"," And then some of you vote and you think that the Republicans and the Democrats are going to somehow"
"14369040","14370500"," win something for you. "
"14372480","14375920"," You think like the Republicans or the Dems are going to really help you."
"14376000","14377700"," In fact, they're both buddies."
"14379080","14381280"," They're both more than likely like doing cocaine. "
"14381960","14383740"," In the back room without you watching."
"14383960","14387320"," The Republicans and Democrats are both buying tickers stocks."
"14388200","14392880"," They're selling together and they come out and they do they parade themselves publicly. "
"14393960","14397180"," So that you guys up the plebs fight with each other."
"14398580","14402080"," So you guys get on the Internet with each other and you're like I hate you and I hate you"
"14402080","14405660"," and I hate you and I hate you and I hate you and I hate you and I hate you."
"14406500","14411680"," Meanwhile, you get all of your politicians are out there just fucking bending all of you over every"
"14411680","14412400"," last one of you. "
"14414260","14414740"," Crazy."
"14417100","14419940"," What our system has come to today is disaster."
"14424350","14425450"," Some of it is okay. "
"14425790","14426790"," Like I realize that."
"14430540","14432600"," Like I saw there's like part of this that's okay."
"14432820","14433620"," Like I'm not anti. "
"14434160","14436700"," I'm not completely anti."
"14442040","14443080"," What do you call them?"
"14443520","14451100"," The people that pay or influencers of the Senate in the in the in the because you got like you've"
"14451100","14455780"," got like I don't know you got like a veteran's group that needs to need to fight for rights for"
"14455780","14456020"," veterans."
"14456260","14457940"," I respect all that kind of stuff. "
"14459820","14460300"," Lobbyists."
"14460520","14465180"," There's some there's some reason to have lobbyists, but you know politicians and their family"
"14465180","14470400"," members shouldn't be trading stocks and they shouldn't be working for lobbyists firms to gain"
"14470400","14470800"," access."
"14471640","14472100"," That kind of stuff. "
"14473240","14473960"," So I don't know."
"14474320","14477740"," I don't know what you expect out of them with the Fed."
"14480400","14483920"," You know, if the Fed comes out at 50 BPS hike. "
"14484240","14486540"," I'm sure that they're all short the market, right?"
"14486780","14488300"," That they already know before it even happens."
"14490980","14492820"," And they protect that power."
"14497030","14497710"," Yeah, lobbyists. "
"14498090","14501750"," They have a place, but not the place that they have right now."
"14502110","14506050"," Right now the lobbyists are turning you you guys on each other or you people, women, men does"
"14506050","14506310"," matter."
"14509510","14513230"," So I guess I'm trying to relate this to the stock market like what because I don't like talking"
"14513230","14515850"," about politics unless it involves the stock market. "
"14516690","14520030"," And when it does involve the stock market, you have to kind of look at it from that perspective"
"14520030","14522090"," that they're not going to just throw them under a bus."
"14522090","14523430"," They're not going to burn them to the stake."
"14524250","14525290"," Any of that kind of stuff. "
"14526710","14528270"," They protect their own."
"14539830","14540630"," Rugby pool."
"14540870","14541590"," The house. "
"14548460","14549620"," Yeah, it's really sad."
"14551420","14553380"," That our politics are hot."
"14553520","14554020"," That's right now. "
"14555040","14555920"," Across the board."
"14560300","14561600"," It's wild too because."
"14562600","14566320"," You know, like you look at the numbers out there and you're like, man, most of these fucking people"
"14566320","14566700"," are poor. "
"14566980","14571100"," Even the ones that think they're making money are in debt up to their fucking eyeballs."
"14587380","14588540"," Yeah, and you're not in it."
"14588720","14593940"," That's the part like, you know, a shock like just going back to that two thousand eighteen on"
"14593940","14595180"," October two thousand eighteen. "
"14595880","14596680"," Senate hearing."
"14597700","14599020"," Trump wasn't in it, right?"
"14599900","14600720"," Trump wasn't in it."
"14600840","14602360"," He got he was he got rolled over. "
"14603920","14606720"," You know, this is a very small group of."
"14607900","14609000"," You're talking about power."
"14609600","14611880"," It's not just money like politicians. "
"14613340","14615160"," The Fed, the Senate."
"14615840","14617840"," There's the or the reference house representatives."
"14618760","14619360"," It is. "
"14619600","14620660"," It is not just money."
"14620920","14622500"," It is this thing called power."
"14623040","14626980"," And it is a matter of fact, you see corporations trying to get this power now, right?"
"14627240","14628260"," Or they did in the. "
"14630440","14631780"," 50s and 60s."
"14632160","14632560"," 30s."
"14632660","14633960"," I started, started in that. "
"14634160","14634580"," That's a revolution."
"14635220","14640320"," But now you see old, not oligarchs, like CEOs now know the, know the power of that."
"14640320","14645600"," CEOs are like, well, I want to control this kingdom of social media. "
"14647060","14648040"," You see it everywhere."
"14648280","14648940"," You see Microsoft."
"14649060","14653980"," You see Twitter and Elon and everyone knows the power of tick talk, right?"
"14654600","14657140"," That's one of these kingdoms of actual power, not money. "
"14657620","14657680"," Power."
"14659580","14661600"," And so they want that power, right?"
"14661880","14664040"," Because power is a very different thing than just money."
"14665260","14666960"," And it's known, right?"
"14666960","14671520"," That, you know, you can get money with power, but power is nothing like power. "
"14671760","14674720"," Power is a very like seductive force."
"14685070","14686350"," Now you might get a squeeze here."
"14686890","14687750"," Should be a squeeze up. "
"14687890","14688470"," We'll find out."
"14691420","14693640"," Yeah, power is a power is a weird thing, man."
"14696240","14699200"," Some of you probably already know about power inside of your own. "
"14699580","14705720"," You might own a company or something or you know, the management or supervisory power that you"
"14705720","14705900"," have."
"14705900","14708560"," Just imagine that being a politician."
"14708940","14711140"," It's it's like it's like rocket fuel. "
"14712060","14718860"," And if you if you control the discourse on one time it was radio, right, then it was TV and"
"14718860","14719400"," then it was cable."
"14720120","14723680"," And now it's a it's a struggle right now on social media."
"14724620","14724720"," Right?"
"14725100","14725580"," You had Reddit. "
"14725900","14727140"," It was a purveyor of."
"14727460","14736960"," And it's still you see the astroturfing and Reddit is all part of you see Twitter"
"14736960","14738140"," attempting to do that."
"14738360","14743780"," You know, Twitter was like the news breaking place, but you know, Elon understands the power of the"
"14743780","14747840"," kingdom of controlling the narrative to you and I, the plebs. "
"14749120","14749560"," Right?"
"14749840","14753040"," TikTok understands that people have their phones up to their face all day long."
"14753220","14756240"," Leave your kids look at the kids at concerts and stuff like that."
"14756420","14756760"," Look at kids. "
"14757600","14759160"," It's just the phone right there."
"14761360","14762400"," You see it on Twitch."
"14762740","14763900"," You see it on YouTube. "
"14763900","14764960"," You see it on."
"14765860","14767000"," You name it, man."
"14767860","14770500"," Now you can see Google is losing that fight right now. "
"14771120","14774620"," You can see Google is somewhat losing that fight on search engine search."
"14775220","14780560"," They own a bunch of it, but they're losing part of that kingdom, that narrative kingdom."
"14783010","14785610"," And there are some very smart people that want to run that kingdom. "
"14794750","14795750"," Yeah, digital feudalism."
"14796230","14796970"," It's happening right now."
"14797170","14799350"," It's very it's wild to watch right now. "
"14800070","14801410"," There's a great video on YouTube."
"14802010","14804810"," I sent it to, I think Chaz."
"14805190","14806030"," I think I sent it to him. "
"14806210","14811350"," There's a guy on YouTube that talked about the digital kingdoms that are out there or the"
"14811350","14814370"," information kingdoms that are out there right now and who owns them."
"14815050","14819370"," Who has the potential to lose them and where that fight is right now."
"14824500","14826160"," You see it in Hollywood. "
"14827760","14831420"," And how the kind of felt like Hollywood doesn't have the power that it once did."
"14831420","14834560"," You can actually see it in the kind of movies that are made now."
"14835660","14838900"," You can see the impact of social media in general. "
"14840020","14843260"," And how it's going to evolve over the next 20, 30 years."
"14845520","14848220"," It won't be on Fox News or CNN."
"14848580","14850880"," It won't be on it'll be on the Internet. "
"14852140","14854640"," That will be your in the next 10, 20 years."
"14854640","14856380"," You'll see it's going to be wild to watch."
"14870710","14874410"," Now the White House saying that we will have some information in the near future on the Fed Vice"
"14874410","14874990"," Chair nominee. "
"14878620","14880700"," You see if there's anything a link to this."

"16989060","16994520"," Someone was saying it was 400 but I think the bears want to get underneath 400 and close under 400."
"16996300","16999900"," To reverse the trend that's setting up on the daily trigger."
"17000960","17004440"," There's like a trend setting up and we always recheck it if we're going to go higher. "
"17005440","17008740"," And sell side wants nothing more than to press the close under that trigger."
"17009440","17010320"," Right now it's like 400."

"17162660","17163500"," Into the bell. "
"17164300","17165740"," I think it's a bloodbath into the bell."
"17167260","17171960"," I want to see the spy tag down here at 40264 currently."
"17173020","17174160"," This is changed slightly. "
"17175960","17177800"," I'd like to buy that dip down there."
"17180760","17182620"," Now 40264 down here."
"17183560","17185120"," Right down here I'm looking to buy that. "
"17186000","17187320"," If that's possible."

"17235740","17242360"," If we trade and close under it's reversal for the bears believe it or"
"17242360","17246240"," not."
"17248580","17254720"," 40195 early marks on close imbalance 78 million to the buy side."
"17255020","17259720"," They'll take it to three three ninety eight eleven minimum and then they'll take it to three ninety"
"17259720","17260780"," five sixty three. "

"17475130","17479050"," I'm going to show you a fifteen on a second."
"17479390","17480190"," Just a second. "
"17483220","17485640"," Some levels for the bears to get through."
"17487200","17488860"," Four oh two seventy five."
"17505470","17507770"," If you are a bull and you're looking to buy a dip. "
"17507770","17508790"," It's down here somewhere."
"17510790","17512550"," Your next one is."
"17515590","17516770"," Four oh two eighty one. "
"17516850","17517570"," It's come up a little bit."
"17518670","17520970"," Right there bear a bull wants to buy that."
"17522450","17525670"," Your next one is three ninety eight fourteen. "
"17541990","17542790"," Right there."
"17550330","17552310"," Three ninety five sixty five."
"17560960","17561440"," Boom. "
"17564540","17565660"," Anything below this."
"17566020","17567700"," No bueno for the bear for the bulls."
"17567720","17568080"," Okay. "
"17570020","17572420"," So this is what you're looking for into tomorrow."
"17577160","17579860"," If you come down to the speech and you catch a bounce here."
"17579900","17581080"," It's actually quite bullish. "
"17582780","17587000"," You're looking for the catch that bounce down below into the speech or even even Wednesday,"
"17587000","17588920"," Thursday, Friday as long as this holds."
"17589400","17590460"," It's good for bulls."
"17590840","17593180"," This is the safest bull trade is down here. "
"17593300","17593800"," Believe it or not."
"17595140","17598580"," You're going to expect selling and pressure into tomorrow."
"17598620","17600200"," Every day, I think you're going to expect. "
"17600440","17603600"," I think it's if it's me, it's kind of like this, right?"
"17604060","17608340"," Kind of like this kind of nonsense until we get done with all this volatility."
"17608700","17612500"," We can actually have huge swings on what happens in the Senate hearing."
"17612500","17613760"," So expect that as well. "
"17613980","17615320"," They're waiting up here to sell above."
"17615840","17616720"," We already know that."
"17621170","17623070"," So I'm going to expect futures to get bought. "
"17623230","17626410"," Maybe not bought, but I'm going to expect flat futures to down tomorrow."
"17627110","17629950"," This is the path that I'm expecting here into."
"17631890","17633210"," Into tomorrow's bed meeting. "
"17633210","17636150"," You're going to be looking for something like this and then something like this."
"17637050","17641730"," If we get any, if I'm assuming that once Powell speaking in front of the Senate, unless it's"
"17641730","17645850"," something we don't know, we're going to get a relief rally up and the seller is going to come right"
"17645850","17647850"," back in and try to sell this thing down."
"17647930","17648170"," Okay. "
"17648170","17649530"," Kind of like a brief moment."
"17649530","17652030"," Maybe we tagged down below something like this."
"17652970","17654390"," And then we'll probably do. "
"17654730","17656530"," I guess I'm doing that wrong here."
"17657350","17659570"," So expect this kind of a move up into the spell."
"17660430","17662990"," Weakness into the speech tomorrow. "
"17663610","17665670"," You can have a brief moment where you come down."
"17666350","17668870"," A little quick bloodbath, maybe the 400 right?"
"17669050","17670250"," I guess that is 400 right there."
"17670690","17673610"," If no unknown news comes up, we trade back higher. "
"17674450","17677850"," You have to be careful about the Q&A session in the Senate tomorrow."
"17677850","17681990"," That could lead us to begin to sell down into the bell and then we'll be right back into the"
"17681990","17685670"," same kind of bullshit for what's coming out on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday."
"17686150","17688370"," Some kind of nonsense like this all week long. "
"17689110","17692730"," So that means they're selling above and buying below as the week moves forward."
"17695270","17696370"," I think tighter."
"17696570","17698150"," I might have to buy this close here. "
"17699410","17702450"," So price target into the close today, 40578."
"17703810","17706510"," Let me see if I can get a better, let me see if I can get a little bit better"
"17706510","17707130"," price target."
"17710250","17711850"," 40525 or so into the close. "
"17720360","17721800"," Let me try to buy this here."
"17722000","17722620"," Hold on a second here."
"17724700","17726480"," We can get above this one minute here. "
"17727780","17729800"," We like to see a squeeze up into the spell."
"17731080","17732200"," But they're trying to sell."
"17732460","17736700"," So if you haven't sold yet, there's more than plenty of opportunity for you to sell up high. "
"17737280","17741000"," So if you get a squeeze at any point and you're looking to be a seller, there's more than likely"
"17741000","17742320"," going to be some chance for that."
"17742860","17746120"," You could have sold with us earlier this afternoon or this morning above."
"17748000","17749920"," What else should I say to you on this topic?"
"17752600","17754860"," There's a five minute chart, five day chart. "
"17757360","17759460"," Yeah, bulls don't want to give this up down here."
"17759620","17760740"," Bulls give this up down here."
"17761000","17761300"," It's reversal. "
"17761880","17763720"," All this turns into was."
"17765560","17769480"," All this turns into was a squeeze for better positioning."
"17770240","17772860"," For a continuation down for the bears. "
"17773280","17773480"," Okay."
"17773580","17773860"," Just right."
"17774000","17774640"," Just like that. "
"17774900","17775000"," Boom."
"17775620","17778100"," And it's back back to the daily."
"17778360","17781620"," This is a month to three months of down three weeks, five weeks. "
"17782280","17784680"," Could be nasty for bears for bulls in here."
"17785420","17786620"," So bulls and bulls."
"17786860","17788700"," If you're trying to buy something, it's probably down here. "
"17789820","17792280"," Your March trade for an up March."
"17792540","17794380"," Our up April somewhere down here."
"17794440","17795300"," This could happen tomorrow. "
"17795680","17797400"," Could happen Wednesday, Thursday, Friday."
"17797400","17799420"," It doesn't have to all happen tomorrow."
"17800680","17804140"," But certainly that's where the next trade is for the bulls. "
"17804680","17807160"," Is that retest of trend."
"17807860","17809800"," Bulls need that retest of trend."
"17810460","17813060"," And then you get that that continuation higher over time. "
"17838520","17841820"," Man, they want me to pay a dollar 82 for four or five C's."
"17842560","17844220"," I fucking hate when they do this."
"17847660","17851420"," Early marks on close imbalance 78 million to the buy side. "
"17851720","17854620"," They don't want to pay a dollar 85 for calls in this close."
"17856860","17857840"," For tomorrow."
"17858880","17863340"," And for today, they've destroyed everything like 404s or 51 cents. "
"17864500","17865980"," There might be a trade there."
"17869460","17871560"," I hate trading zero dates like this."
"17872380","17873600"," Like a zero day for today. "
"17873600","17876820"," For the last what time is it for 20 minutes calls."
"17886080","17887500"," Torch the Ponzi, baby."
"17888200","17889840"," Three ninety eight would be ideal. "
"17890040","17890680"," I agree."
"17890880","17896380"," I agree, Mero."
"17916320","17916920"," Hey, David. "
"17917140","17917700"," How are you?"
"17932830","17934790"," Yeah, I'm on some of these calls right now."
"17937470","17940870"," I'm on some of their too dangerous to be for you guys to be trading."
"17941670","17944730"," I'm on some I'm on a I'm on a trade right now in zero dates. "
"17948350","17949550"," They're hella dangerous though."
"17954150","17955550"," I'm not going to tell you what I'm on."
"17957290","17965800"," I want to see these. "
"17965940","17967580"," I want to see a straight higher into this bell."
"17969240","17972960"," I'd like to actually I'd actually like to own these calls for a little while."
"17973840","17977120"," Get up to where these sellers are up here and then take a put position above. "
"17990930","17991830"," That was a nice trade."
"17995390","17996850"," I want to see us get up into here."
"17996970","17998190"," Four oh five and some change. "
"18004230","18007950"," If you are taking calls here, be really careful of four oh four seventy one."
"18009590","18010710"," You can always take some off."
"18012830","18015210"," See if you can jump back in again on the next trade higher. "
"18016410","18017150"," We can get up here."
"18018010","18018870"," That would be the next trade."
"18019770","18020750"," Take the money right here. "
"18026980","18028300"," Four oh four C's."
"18069420","18071320"," Yeah, there's tons of gaps on Apple."
"18087240","18088840"," You're all zero data assassins. "
"18097760","18099240"," You're not squeezing out Mero."
"18099880","18101460"," I already know you're not squeezing them out."
"18102140","18103540"," It takes both sides of the trade here. "
"18104180","18105420"," So he ends up owning Apple."
"18129340","18131280"," Keep your eyes on Vic's hair, boys and girls."
"18138420","18139800"," Yeah, they're not listening, Mero. "
"18139920","18140860"," They don't understand the concept."
"18141040","18142520"," It's the same concept as the BGL."
"18145820","18147340"," Early marks on clothes imbalance. "
"18148040","18148720"," Seventy eight million."
"18149000","18149700"," Yeah, probably up."
"18149820","18150060"," Get it. "
"18150540","18150940"," So the idea."
"18151180","18151820"," I didn't."
"18151940","18153180"," Mero is trying to tell you is that. "
"18153700","18155620"," Or the whole thing is that you've got."

"18600740","18601940"," Should I just get some anyways?"
"18602420","18603680"," I'll just say fuck it and buy some puts. "
"18612100","18613240"," What am I looking at here?"
"18613580","18616320"," 400 peas for tomorrow or they were only 50 cents."
"18618520","18620760"," Are they going to try to fuck around in those things tomorrow?"
"18621400","18621960"," Hmm."
"18640570","18642630"," Japan increases rate hikes tonight. "
"18642690","18643770"," Good night, baby girl."
"18644530","18646830"," Oh, yeah, you guys are betting on that, aren't you?"
"18653040","18654280"," Yeah, I use the."
"18655880","18657260"," I use a mirror. "
"18657420","18659800"," I use a Estau as my."
"18660140","18661400"," I love Estau man."
"18662760","18665340"," Estau is like my jam brother. "
"18665680","18666880"," I fucking love it."
"18666880","18670520"," I love it because it's never traded."
"18670780","18672880"," And whenever they enter those trades, it always goes there. "
"18678130","18682330"," So Mirro is saying pay attention to large inverse ETF funds."
"18683170","18685590"," That there's clues there that use volume bars."
"18686190","18690870"," So there's a few traders out there with me that use Estau as an indicator. "
"18691730","18696010"," We watch the options chain and Estau and you'll see call buyers."
"18696010","18700690"," It's an inverse ETF, triple average, I think ETF."
"18701690","18705070"," And you'll see like call buyers move in and move out, move in and move out. "
"18705150","18707890"," There's never like, there's never always call buyers there."
"18708010","18708490"," There's only."
"18709750","18710630"," Only sometimes. "
"18711110","18716290"," So you'll see like 500 contract spot and then they remove them and they buy them, they remove them."
"18717270","18722450"," And you can actually get a viewpoint of who's doing shit behind the scene, like where the spy is"
"18722450","18722910"," kind of."
"18722910","18726170"," There's always volume coming and going inside of the spy options chain. "
"18726510","18728230"," We use the Estau for that."
"18731470","18732030"," That's right."
"18734650","18735190"," That's right. "
"18735750","18738530"," OP strikes are more obvious to sees talking about."
"18742410","18744510"," The zeros and the fives and all that kind of stuff."
"18744550","18746550"," I'm assuming, but that's what I look for the most. "
"18746550","18747730"," I look for the most."
"18747910","18751870"," I end with it like in a, in a lightly traded inverse ETF."
"18752470","18757390"," I go to whatever the highest or the highest concentration of OI is on that ticker and I watch it"
"18757390","18758330"," when they come in and they come out. "
"18758470","18759190"," They come in and they come out."
"18769290","18771890"," No, no, you want to look at, you want to look into."
"18771970","18774450"," So cowboy up saying Estau is looking flattish. "
"18774570","18776730"," You want to open up the options chain, right?"
"18776990","18782670"," And look at the like the March 17th Estau and the June 6th Estau options chain."
"18782670","18786590"," And you will, if you pay attention to those strikes in there right now, I think it's 23 or"
"18786590","18791270"," something that they're all in on, but you'll, you'll watch them come in and come out, come in and"
"18791270","18791690"," come out."
"18792870","18800050"," So unlike a, unlike, unlike the spa, you can actually see the flow into those to print for hedge"
"18800050","18800330"," fund. "
"18803530","18804510"," Yeah, Mero town."
"18804650","18808210"," So Mero saying spy res is very, very hard to read almost impossible."
"18809290","18814950"," And so you can actually read this shit inside of the options chain of lightly, well, heavily traded"
"18814950","18820990"," when there's a move, but lightly traded inverse ETFs, especially leverage ones. "
"18821450","18825890"," You'll see them, the OI actually creep in on the day when they want them."
"18826490","18827590"," Well, that wouldn't be a lie."
"18827730","18830630"," It would be the implied ball for that day. "
"18834830","18840930"," You want that disco ball, yeah, I think we, if it doesn't happen now, it's going to happen after"
"18840930","18841270"," hours."
"18841270","18842690"," They're going to try to bloodbath this shit."
"18847680","18849920"," There's that 40264 down below. "
"18852060","18854500"," Let me know what your positioning is in the chat."
"18854680","18857360"," If you're in the chat, are you short into tomorrow?"
"18857360","18860420"," Are you looking for a higher high to short into tomorrow?"
"18861040","18862520"," Are you long into tomorrow?"
"18862980","18867820"," Are you just been long and you're looking for protection on your trade?"
"18867820","18872500"," Are you, I don't know, you have a butterfly that you're sitting in full on or you're selling"
"18872500","18873820"," butterflies buying butterflies?"
"18874300","18874740"," What are you doing?"
"18875800","18878580"," Are you just sitting on the sidelines looking for a dip to buy?"
"18880720","18883900"," Did you time the top perfectly take your money and run?"
"18884700","18887220"," Did you get out on Friday and you're flat now?"
"18887400","18890800"," Did you hold into 407 today and take the money and run?"
"18896000","18899780"," Let me know in the chat in YouTube and on Twitch, please."
"18903750","18905130"," What's that been bought flat?"
"18908800","18910600"," And I'm currently flat right now. "
"18910600","18911480"," I don't own anything."
"18915830","18917930"," Yeah, Mero's going large short overnight."
"18918750","18919990"," I can see that Mero. "
"18920350","18928450"," I can see that the, um, my assumption here is that, my assumption here is that Vix looks like it"
"18928450","18929190"," wants to fuck."
"18930090","18931850"," But when can you do it?"
"18932270","18938830"," You figure that the dealers will probably be neutralish overnight, but there's probably a point for"
"18938830","18945210"," AM, 6 AM somewhere in there, 3.30, 3.15. When the Europours wake up and they start selling the"
"18945210","18950850"," market at 3.15 in the morning, fair fucking chance that they're going to try to sell this down by"
"18950850","18951410"," open tomorrow."
"18953030","18956070"," In cash market, I don't know if there's that trade for you. "
"18957330","18958750"," There might be on this bell."
"18958950","18962450"," Maybe you wait until 4.15 to put some puts on or something."
"18962450","18966750"," Oh, that's what I think somewhere in there. "
"18967010","18968230"," I'm going to watch this bell today."
"18968330","18974350"," If we can trade up into the bell at 4.15, I think catch a swing down into tomorrow."
"18975030","18979790"," They'll probably start selling it before you even come into cash tomorrow. "
"18980890","18987850"," My assumption would be set your alarm for like 3.30, 3.15. They'll do fuck around sideways all"
"18987850","18990630"," night long and then around 3.15 in the morning, they'll start selling it."
"18991610","18996790"," Sell it down to like 4 o'clock, 6 o'clock in the morning, another rip higher and then read"
"18996790","18998030"," by opening cash market."
"18998870","19000550"," That's the logic. "
"19003490","19005730"," If they start to repair it, I agree with that too."
"19014740","19019720"," They'll try to short this shit down at 3.30. Those fucking dealers are going to come out of the"
"19019720","19020240"," woodwork tonight."
"19021560","19022800"," That's what Mirror's talking about repair. "
"19023080","19024560"," He's talking about dealers coming out and hedging."
"19031780","19033700"," You think they'll pump it up in the morning?"
"19034340","19035180"," We'll see, Mirror."
"19035360","19035880"," I'm interested. "
"19040600","19042020"," All right, so all of you have a great night."
"19042580","19046700"," I'm going to watch this bell for the 4.15 or so, see what happens if we start to squeeze"
"19046700","19053140"," it higher and I can grab some puts maybe at 4.15. If not, then I'll be back for cash"
"19053140","19053860"," market tomorrow."
"19054040","19056240"," I have no wants to trade this market in the overnight. "
