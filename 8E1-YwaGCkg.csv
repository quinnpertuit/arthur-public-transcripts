"47730","59390"," You good"
"59390","63470"," morning, Chris Hoch, Gary, Faison, Matthias, Chan 2, good morning, everybody."
"63950","65590"," Hope you're all doing well out there."
"74880","76540"," Hi, good morning, Joey. "
"78560","79320"," Dan Briezen, what up?"
"79780","89660"," Good morning, buenos adias, John, Lawrence B.D. What's going on this morning, everybody?"
"91180","92440"," I'm a little fucked up today."
"92600","94240"," I fucked up my arm yesterday."
"99780","102180"," I tore some muscles in my arm yesterday. "
"103740","105400"," I'm literally can't move."
"105600","108760"," I can't force my arm, but I can't move my arm right now."
"109020","109860"," It's all fucked up. "
"113790","115050"," So we'll get right into it."
"115110","117390"," We're not going to put the foot around today."
"121290","122330"," Good morning, everybody. "
"122610","123230"," How's everybody doing?"
"123390","124350"," Everybody's doing well out there."
"124470","128289"," Lone Wolf, Fisted, Jasmine, Cecilia, William, Mr. Brown."
"128930","129810"," Baking, my brother. "
"130070","133330"," Good to see you, Patrick, Carlie, James Wallace."
"134730","136990"," Good evening from Thailand, baby, RS."
"138050","138870"," Good to see everybody. "
"140870","142750"," We're going to roll right into it this morning."
"142970","144090"," We're going to turn that music down."
"145730","146950"," We're going to get right into it. "
"147150","154110"," If you see me kind of acting weird today, I've got a fucked up arm."
"154310","155410"," I fucked it up real bad."
"156310","157350"," I think I've got to go to the doctor. "
"158930","161910"," A little bit of a bounce here on the spy right now, currently."
"162710","165290"," A little bit of support showing up down here."
"166070","167850"," You can see the support here. "
"168710","170350"," I want to show you a few things, though."
"170350","174290"," This is the zone of liquidity stepping in down below."
"174870","177130"," Currently, we are at 423.37, a quick bounce. "
"178370","180410"," Good place to catch a bounce, I guess, right?"
"181490","183030"," We talked about this morning."
"183190","184730"," I posted on Twitter Twitter."
"185650","194530"," You can see this nice area right here of buyers, 43.50. And then 420 should be bottom for today. "
"195530","197730"," I don't expect a couple of things."
"197730","203090"," If you catch this bottom right now, if you catch this bottom right now, there should be a good"
"203090","203710"," bottom to buy."
"205690","208810"," I wouldn't hold it that long as the only thing that I would say on that. "
"209810","212110"," We'll get into the reasons why here in just a minute."
"212890","214850"," I do want you to really see those."
"215050","215970"," I want you to see this 420. "
"216750","218750"," There's still money waiting down below here."
"219490","224610"," We could still, if you watch my cursor here, we can catch this bounce and roll over to 420 down"
"224610","224870"," below."
"225750","227390"," This is more conservative. "
"227650","228910"," Dip buyers are down here 420."
"230790","233390"," What I really want you to show you down here is this 415."
"234530","237390"," I want you to see this and mark this up. "
"237510","244250"," I posted, or I talked about this on Twitter yesterday, that your next stop, your next bottom is"
"244250","244570"," 415."
"247280","252200"," We'll take a quick look at that right now, just to get some stuff out of the way here."
"253820","256300"," What's the point that's trying to be made here?"
"256880","260160"," That would be, we go back to a month chart here. "
"263160","265080"," See if this makes it clear, right?"
"266140","269300"," You know, it's like we're just trying to work up off the early session lows in the way."
"269400","270120"," It could be better than expected."
"270540","275160"," April Richmond, Fred reading and consumer confidence, also coming in just below expectations. "
"276720","278120"," So, yeah, this is funny."
"278120","283900"," The Dow is down about 160, the S&P is down 30, and the VIX at 28, 79 remains up"
"283900","290900"," about 6.5%. The US 10, you yield 2.76% as a few basis points higher than we were"
"290900","292260"," heading into the Richmond Fed rating."
"293760","297200"," So, you can see this, the support down below here, 415, right?"
"297400","298500"," This is really what you want to be buying. "
"299820","300760"," This is down here."
"300900","305460"," If you're a bull and you don't want to put too much risk on, let's be your next dip buys"
"305460","307000"," down here, 415-ish."
"307940","311360"," We got the spot, nice bounce yesterday at 418, right?"
"311480","313500"," We could catch some dips and ride this out. "
"314100","317200"," We've got some great earnings this week, and we should be able to ride this out."
"317300","320940"," It wouldn't shock me to see us each day of important earnings."
"322340","326660"," Let's say we get a, that's what we trade sideways in the close possible, right?"
"327340","333180"," Either way, if we get a bad earnings report, then we'll trade down to these levels where we can"
"333180","334900"," catch some support, right?"
"335640","340760"," And then we're going to sell off even good earnings as we trade higher if we do, right?"
"340900","342760"," So, this is all gambling type stuff. "
"344040","354860"," With that being said, you know, our original thought was we trade down here into FOMC, and"
"354860","359360"," then of course we had this move here that said, no, fuck you, we're not doing that."
"359580","365400"," Too many people are long puts, so they burned the puts up here, right?"
"365680","366700"," And we reversed course."
"367940","373920"," We knew that we reversed course that the vol trigger was up here, and that you would sell any rip"
"373920","376380"," once we traded down below the vol trigger. "
"376940","378360"," And that's what we've done, right?"
"379380","384680"," And so we're still in that regime right now until we break above the vol trigger."
"384680","386220"," And I haven't looked to see where it is right now."
"386240","389480"," I'm going to assume it's at 440 flat somewhere in here. "
"389800","393260"," Hit the breakout, again, break out of this negative channel, right?"
"393680","399620"," Until we break out of this negative channel, we're not, we're not, we're not bullish, right?"
"399840","400940"," Then you give it to the bulls again."
"401680","406860"," Russian Defense Ministry saying that London's direct provocation in Kyiv to strike targets on"
"406860","410620"," Russian territory will immediately lead to proportional response."
"411240","416940"," It's being reported across Defense Ministry, commenting directly to the UK. "
"418400","426060"," So with that being said, as long as we're down here, what you should be doing is buying dips,"
"426380","426500"," right?"
"427560","428860"," And selling rips."
"429520","430880"," So just keep that in mind."
"431120","434500"," So as we get down here, we're still not at full market liquidation yet. "
"435080","437420"," I know it seemed like a yes, so we got down there for a minute."
"437420","440160"," There was a safety, but I took this buy down below yesterday."
"440400","444040"," I bought this yesterday, but I took my winnings as well yesterday. "
"445540","447180"," So there's some positives here."
"447260","457220"," If you're a bull, if we do trade down into FOMC, into Russia default, you know some places that you"
"457220","462180"," can buy bottoms as we trade down into the fourth."
"462420","467240"," If we trade down in the fourth, you know some places that you can buy some bottoms, which is kind"
"467240","467960"," of fucking nice. "
"468400","471920"," In relative safety, you can buy bottoms down here if you're a bull."
"472820","473900"," That's a good sign, right?"
"474040","477820"," Up here is kind of risky, you're kind of scared or whatever, but you know that down here to some"
"477820","479280"," extent, you're going to be able to buy this stuff."
"479740","483460"," In some kind of relative safety, now that we're going higher. "
"484120","489000"," Those bottoms we bought by Algorithm, Algorithm at computers and stuff like that."
"490580","496060"," Now with that said, even if we trade sideways in here, if you're a bull, you're just looking for"
"496060","496780"," bottoms to buy."
"497360","503080"," And currently right now, the safest place to buy a bottom in this market today is $4.15, right here"
"503080","505060"," that we have some pretty firm support here today. "
"505760","507680"," Now do I think we trade down to $4.15 today?"
"507700","508180"," Probably not."
"508340","509520"," Probably catch a nice bounce today."
"509920","511020"," Probably keep it up in here. "
"511880","516919"," Now we'll look at the economic calendar because, or at the earnings calendar, because the other"
"516919","519919"," fear is even if we have good earnings, right?"
"520559","522480"," So you've got Microsoft and Apple at the end of the day today."
"523720","533260"," You've got Meta, PayPal, Boeing, a Hertz, Qualcomm, baby, ADP, an important one, believe it or not."
"533880","536080"," And then we've got, this should be quite well actually, right?"
"536320","537640"," Or they should report quite well. "
"538940","544860"," Amazon, Roku, Robinhood, McDonald's, all the retail favorites, Domino's."
"545480","547380"," I don't think they do so well, Domino's."
"548080","553140"," But you can see that we've got some large players that once the weekend ends on Friday, we don't. "
"553640","557760"," From Friday, some of those bigger reports peel off."
"557900","558700"," We talked about that last week."
"558820","566020"," We said if they hold the market up long enough for these earnings to get out of the way, what"
"566020","566780"," happens to the market?"
"566940","567840"," Does it begin to roll over?"
"568680","571220"," And so that's the only thing I want to say to you is do you end up seeing, you know,"
"571900","578660"," maintaining some kind of a training zone and then we head lower after ER into FMC. "
"581240","582840"," So look at that out of the way there."
"583620","587440"," So if you're a bull, you're looking to buy for 15, that is the key to know."
"587620","590520"," If you want to buy in safety, that's what you're looking for. "
"591560","592940"," I'll bounce off for 15."
"593120","593600"," Do you get it today?"
"593760","594220"," Do you get it tomorrow?"
"594420","594880"," I don't know."
"595480","598040"," Do you do it in the middle more than likely not?"
"599260","601760"," Do you use these opportunities up here to sell the rip?"
"602060","602260"," Yes. "
"602820","606740"," Yesterday I told you we'd be like, or the top was 430, I said."
"608320","611840"," I said, next step above is 436 up here."
"612160","613960"," I said, unlikely that we get there. "
"615100","619840"," That should have been a nod to you and to the bell to short, right?"
"620040","621520"," Or at least on the open to short."
"623120","627100"," To take the moment to sell this, to sell the rip up here, right?"
"627100","628500"," Anything up here?"
"628620","633340"," You're selling the rip and it'll be buying the dip down below as we head into FMC."
"637080","639900"," Should be pretty straightforward, pretty basic to understand. "
"641120","646840"," And furthermore, yesterday I posted about XLP not quite liquidating."
"647380","653300"," There are still there are bulls hiding in XLP in stables."
"653520","655080"," You can see it's holding up this morning. "
"655940","657860"," It has not sold off, right?"
"658460","665660"," Said to yesterday on Twitter, I think, today look, these fucking bulls are still hiding up in here"
"665660","666300"," in XLP."
"666580","667860"," It's going to bid this morning."
"668660","669180"," Shocker. "
"670060","672000"," We'll also take a look at XLU."
"672460","676080"," You still have a bid in parts of the market."
"676340","677660"," XLU is a bid this morning. "
"678340","679340"," Probably trade this today."
"680220","685120"," Even if the spies down you probably trade these in relative safety right now."
"685560","690200"," These fucking bulls are still believing that the market's coming up. "
"691000","692500"," Do I think the market's coming up?"
"692880","693140"," Yes."
"693800","697120"," Do I think the market's coming up from where we are currently at this moment?"
"698480","699280"," Probably not."
"700400","701720"," Do I think we're turning a 405?"
"702340","703140"," Ah, good chance of it. "
"703420","704320"," But now here's the deal."
"704500","709180"," If you had bought yesterday, if you said, fuck the captain, market's not going to liquidate from"
"709180","710960"," here, I think you're fine."
"711560","715420"," I think you could have bought some spreads yesterday down in this dip. "
"716040","718440"," And I think over time, yeah, it's going to swing higher."
"718980","721240"," Put a month on them, put a month and a half on them."
"722660","724520"," Or even longer, two months, three months. "
"724740","725480"," Do I think we swing higher?"
"725720","726360"," Fuck yes, I do."
"726960","731980"," I fucking think that the moment that all this bullshit happens, we're going to swing higher."
"732300","733580"," Now, there is some risk here. "
"733960","738280"," If you were to buy call spreads yesterday, even if you put a month and a half on, let's see,"
"738280","739240"," put a month and a half on them."
"740100","741360"," There is some risk."
"742220","743740"," I would say, ah, fuck. "
"744660","745980"," I'm having spasms in my arm."
"746840","750600"," So if you were to buy call spreads yesterday, I would have recommended that you get them three"
"750600","752300"," months out, not just month and a half."
"752920","754880"," I don't think the month and a half in here. "
"755140","756420"," I think that's still a dangerous trade."
"757500","761660"," And I'm going to tell you that because there is a slight possibility."
"762860","771990"," If Russia were to default on FMC, not only do you get the trade lower down here in FMC, but"
"771990","772670"," there could be a clip. "
"773150","775810"," But it could be a couple of days after."
"775970","781230"," If we don't get that straight bounce up, that rip-roar and V shape rally, it could be an"
"781230","784350"," anticipation of a default by Russia."
"785510","790230"," If that were the case, there's where your risk is, right?"
"790230","793490"," Your month and a half call spreads over here yesterday. "
"794610","796170"," More than likely would get burned."
"796930","801390"," I bet I would bet that if we if we if we crash down here, that it would take three"
"801390","803950"," months to get back to this point right here."
"804890","810150"," It'd be intentionally made by market makers and dealers that we don't get back until they burn"
"810150","813210"," everything, believe it or not, back to 420. "
"813790","816230"," We could trade down to like 360, believe it or not."
"816230","818910"," We could trade down to 380, 360 somewhere down there quickly."
"819410","821270"," Now, what does that mean?"
"821410","822430"," That's like a market crash, right?"
"822850","824870"," And they can blame it on FMC. "
"825830","826650"," They can blame it on."
"826930","834070"," And we already know that matter of fact yesterday, I heard talk on Twitter saying, well, if they"
"834070","841730"," increase 50 BPS, the next two or three meetings, they're going to have to pull the put."
"842350","844110"," Or they're going to have to institute the Fed put. "
"844110","846890"," And we know that J-POW was like, fuck you."
"847530","848870"," I don't give a fuck."
"850590","856310"," So when they say that, when he said that the other day, he is telling you, he's saying to you,"
"856610","857130"," fuck you. "
"857810","859570"," He's like, I'm telling you in advance."
"860830","861630"," I don't care."
"864140","866180"," I don't fucking care what you say. "
"866660","868460"," I don't care if inflation peaked in March."
"869180","869820"," I'm sticking to my guns."
"870060","871240"," Now, you may or may not believe them. "
"871460","873360"," We know they've lied in the past that they've lost."
"874900","877340"," They've lost credibility at different times, right?"
"877500","878620"," But the key is this."
"879300","881240"," The fourth hasn't happened yet, right for FMC. "
"882340","891380"," If we're down here on FMC and T restates, yeah, we're not taking, we're not instituting the Fed"
"891380","891860"," put, right?"
"892180","892860"," We're in the Fed call."
"894680","896260"," Then we will trade lower."
"896580","899500"," And if Russia defaults, believe it or not, it could be used as an excuse. "
"899500","903740"," Furthermore, there's volatility around Russia defaulting."
"904520","906220"," I made that post this morning."
"906360","908900"," It was noted on Spock M a few times the past month. "
"909100","915160"," But further, it actually brings up volatility in terms of just war, expansion of war."
"915960","921160"," A lot of threats coming out of Russia right now on what they'll do to the, what they'll do to"
"921160","924160"," Europe, the EU, NATO, UN, US."
"925220","928780"," They launched a new, a test, a Nuke Tesla. "
"928780","933400"," I think it was last week of the week before the Satan ballistic missile."
"933860","939600"," And they're trying to protect these silos right now in case of war."
"940120","944160"," Now, you saw that the oligarchs are being whacked and their families are being whacked. "
"944620","947560"," There could be internal strife within Russia that you don't know about."
"948140","949600"," That's not leaking to the public."
"949760","950840"," They don't want to scare the public. "
"951940","962200"," Now, this weapon that we have of Russia defaulting on the, on that heading into their default, you"
"962200","967080"," know, it could, it could cause just more volatility here where it sends our markets lower."
"967200","969840"," It can be used as an excuse is my point."
"969860","970660"," Does it matter?"
"971140","972600"," I don't fucking think it does. "
"973100","976800"," But does it, is it used as an excuse to drop the market even further?"
"977880","978800"," And we have ERs."
"979560","981380"," We have large tech ERs."
"981480","985920"," The perfect, perfect excuse and timing for us to actually go lower than four or five. "
"985920","986900"," So what does that mean?"
"987420","990640"," If you took a month and a half call spread right here, I would say to you."
"990820","992440"," And there's still some risk in here."
"992880","995200"," So you either want to put three months on them. "
"995900","997740"," Time would be, would be your friend."
"998500","1001600"," Or you kind of wait as we trade into this zone down lower."
"1002000","1005280"," We kind of, we kind of, we kind of wait for those bulls. "
"1006020","1008800"," You need, you need the bulls in XLP and XLU to panic."
"1009020","1010160"," You need blood in the streets."
"1010420","1013340"," You need CNBC saying, oh shit, we're all fucked. "
"1014300","1014540"," Right?"
"1014740","1015560"," You need blood everywhere."
"1015560","1019040"," You need people to say XLU is not safe."
"1019740","1027960"," We need the long tail risk crowd to come out on CNBC and say, you're not safe in bonds. "
"1028280","1029440"," You're not safe in equities."
"1029579","1031119"," You're not safe in XLU."
"1031460","1032460"," There's nowhere safe. "
"1032740","1039079"," Get by gold and fucking, you know, stuff your mattress is full of cash for you to actually be safe"
"1039079","1040800"," buying a liquidation event down here."
"1040800","1045480"," So myself, I have not bought this dip with, with spreads."
"1045819","1051020"," You, I've already told you that I will do this live with you when the time comes. "
"1051340","1052380"," I don't think it's now."
"1052540","1053640"," I think it's further down."
"1053740","1054820"," I think it's somewhere down in here. "
"1055300","1057620"," At least in a bit."
"1057780","1060320"," Let's say we do have that liquidation breakdown of 360."
"1061380","1062800"," This is a very small risk. "
"1063000","1063740"," Let's say 5%."
"1063740","1068940"," But if we did get that breakdown there and we had bought call spreads in here."
"1068940","1071940"," I would expect a snap down. "
"1072820","1077440"," I don't think we're going there, but I think if we get a snap down to 363, something like that,"
"1077700","1081540"," I would at least with a month and a half, I would expect it to trade higher and print those"
"1081540","1083360"," calls that I had purchased."
"1084140","1088920"," So that's my point is how much risk you're going to take on in this call buying or in this,"
"1088920","1090400"," in this bottom buying down here."
"1090760","1092080"," I just don't think we're quite there yet. "
"1092200","1092800"," We're almost there."
"1093280","1094420"," We're not quite there."
"1094820","1097500"," Now another thing to take a look at would be. "
"1098820","1099220"," March."
"1099560","1100520"," Okay, we're going to go back to March."
"1102000","1106140"," And you can kind of see the same kind of a thing happen down here, right?"
"1109290","1110270"," Let's see right here. "
"1111150","1112950"," You can kind of see that same kind of a thing."
"1113090","1116550"," You think you're at bottom down here and then you had lower right."
"1117270","1119110"," And you spent some time down here. "
"1119230","1123570"," We've talked about this right when you're down here, when you're down here, trading down here in"
"1123570","1123990"," this zone."
"1124130","1125910"," It's still one, two, three, four."
"1126050","1126330"," What is that?"
"1126330","1127770"," Fucking almost a month, right?"
"1128290","1128770"," Not quite. "
"1129350","1132830"," Yeah, almost a month of panic, right?"
"1133030","1135670"," Let's see you buy some call spreads here and their way up here and they didn't print."
"1136270","1138790"," And you kind of have to diamond hand until they do print."
"1141370","1144850"," So that's my only point is we could have something like this take place. "
"1145190","1146770"," We've seen it again down here, right?"
"1146890","1151950"," We think we're done and then we continue lower and we kind of fuck around for a few sessions."
"1151990","1158510"," You can see this area here would look similar to what we'd expect in the coming days, right?"
"1160130","1163830"," Consolidation, more lows, more opportunities to buy a dip."
"1164970","1168310"," Not quite the first dip, the first bounce we get down here. "
"1169690","1173430"," Wait for it to settle down a little bit and then we grab them and we run them higher."
"1180900","1187300"," Now trading down below to 421, 43 with a bounce."
"1187600","1195840"," We'll take a look back here on, go back on Twitter, who is bullish?"
"1195940","1199480"," So we have this nice little support down here, 420. "
"1202140","1204780"," I got some volume below here."
"1205520","1207260"," See we got real whiz, the real liquidity."
"1208380","1209640"," Yeah, we know it's down below. "
"1209980","1213640"," The real buyer is down below 415 and see him down here, right?"
"1219130","1224450"," Where the real liquidity is."
"1224450","1227170"," We'll take a look at this 421, 43 quick bounce."
"1228310","1234610"," And we'll put another little mark down below here, right here somewhere in here. "
"1235330","1238730"," And this is our, this is, wait a minute, hold on here."
"1245660","1246460"," I'm just sitting here."
"1252610","1254510"," Now we've got some buyers down here. "
"1261160","1267260"," And we know safety, if you're a bull, if you want to be safe, that your safety to buy a"
"1267260","1268380"," dip is down here, right?"
"1268840","1270360"," This is safety to buy a dip."
"1274910","1288140"," This is where you're, or you"
"1288140","1289540"," could just right buy the fucking dip."
"1293110","1295070"," I'm going to get down here, 415 or so. "
"1297440","1298700"," Okay, so you can see that there."
"1300180","1303200"," And if you get caught in here, you could be in the buying this dip down here."
"1303300","1306620"," We trade sideways anticipating ER statements, right?"
"1306780","1309480"," Let's say you buy the dip down here, you're not buying spreads. "
"1310240","1313540"," If you're just buying fucking naked color, not naked, not naked out."
"1313540","1313960"," Hold on a second."
"1314400","1315200"," I'm having a problem. "
"1315200","1315880"," My arm right now."
"1319720","1321780"," But you get caught down here, right?"
"1322340","1325000"," There was some, there was some of that down here yesterday, right?"
"1326180","1327840"," Some danger of grinding, right?"
"1327980","1332560"," These are market makers in here in Dailers, just fucking up bulls down here."
"1332660","1333360"," I bought a couple of these. "
"1333460","1337120"," The bought this dip actually made, I made like 50% or something on the trade here."
"1337700","1338500"," That was a good trade."
"1339480","1340460"," And this was a decent trade. "
"1340460","1343100"," But even this one here is the day war on yesterday."
"1343700","1349280"," I was afraid that they were going to eat all the premium, the intrinsic value of options yesterday."
"1349580","1351420"," So just be careful down here if you're going to buy a dip. "
"1353700","1355740"," If you're looking for a dip to buy down here."
"1356320","1362320"," And we're going to look at Amazon real quick because Amazon no bueno, right?"
"1362840","1365300"," But Amazon gave them, gave back almost everything."
"1366720","1376710"," And just looking for those lower"
"1376710","1377670"," lows down there. "
"1378830","1381390"," $2,600 price target down here, right?"
"1381690","1384050"," We got down here $2,644."
"1386270","1388030"," This is bearish, right?"
"1388230","1390130"," Nothing about this is bullish, right?"
"1390870","1396650"," If Amazon were to continue selling off here, we might catch a dip here, but look at this."
"1396770","1397650"," This is not bullish. "
"1398170","1399870"," Nothing about this is bullish right now, right?"
"1400490","1402970"," Just another opportunity to short into their ER."
"1403870","1409010"," So if you start to look at the components of the underlying of the market, right?"
"1409310","1410510"," Is this bullish to you?"
"1410850","1412730"," Does Apple show you bullish right now?"
"1413410","1415670"," Does that look bullish with not even charting this?"
"1416170","1417430"," Does this look bullish to you?"
"1418250","1418910"," It looks bearish."
"1419590","1420650"," That's what it looks like, right?"
"1422010","1422890"," Looks bearish. "
"1423390","1424310"," If you could tap here, right?"
"1424510","1426510"," One, two, couple taps, then a quick little run below."
"1427310","1429690"," That's that 405 that you get down here, right?"
"1430370","1432290"," That's how you get 405 on this guy."
"1432470","1436150"," The bottom of the arrow will get the April Texas service sector outlook survey. "
"1439680","1441140"," What's going on over here?"
"1441920","1443900"," The fuck is going on with Tesla?"
"1447300","1448720"," What did we talk about last week?"
"1448960","1449300"," Remember this?"
"1449900","1450420"," Remember this?"
"1450700","1451820"," One, two, and three?"
"1452800","1454240"," Did I say last week?"
"1457840","1461600"," So you're waiting for this, and I was told no, that ain't happening."
"1462420","1463200"," That's all right."
"1464140","1464960"," We'll get there. "
"1467900","1468400"," That sucks."
"1468400","1469100"," Look at that."
"1469260","1470060"," It's fucking terrible. "
"1471220","1471900"," It's fucking awful."
"1475390","1476030"," It's terrible."
"1479720","1481540"," So, now this is bearish, right?"
"1481680","1482580"," We know this is bearish. "
"1482660","1483260"," We know this is weak."
"1485020","1487180"," We are looking for some dips to buy here."
"1488200","1491200"," But the market in general is weak heading into FMC. "
"1491840","1493220"," If that's what at least we're showing."
"1493720","1495420"," It's showing the weak heading in FMC."
"1495640","1497340"," It's showing that the market could drop further. "
"1497680","1498360"," Have further declines."
"1500300","1506460"," And it's showing that as these long-term bulls start to cut their positions loose, that there could"
"1506460","1507540"," be an impact market wide."
"1509100","1509580"," Right?"
"1510460","1511740"," Man, that sucks to see. "
"1512260","1514960"," Even though I want to buy down here, this sucks to watch."
"1516480","1518280"," It fucking pains me to watch this."
"1520380","1525620"," And you can see in a larger scale on the spy and where we can actually head down here. "
"1525660","1527220"," How low can we go, right?"
"1527680","1531120"," There's that 405 down here, 405, 400."
"1532660","1536360"," How deep can we take it in this market?"
"1536760","1538440"," So, with that said, right?"
"1538620","1539780"," Where do we buy this today?"
"1540280","1541640"," Do we get trapped in here today?"
"1542480","1546280"," My point to you would be if you buy this, I would say buy it with a spread."
"1547980","1550160"," Look for dip buyers on the way down. "
"1551720","1553460"," And you put on your own risk."
"1553620","1556220"," You decide, hey, I'm going to put this risk on cap either."
"1556220","1560560"," Either in this zone down here, right here where we are, where these buyers are. "
"1561460","1564580"," And maybe with 10% and you add 30, you do like an ABC."
"1565080","1569920"," You go A, buy in that, B, buy in that, or C."
"1570960","1571600"," And you decide, right?"
"1571760","1576180"," If you missed the trade, if you missed the trade, because you didn't want to put all the risk on"
"1576180","1579280"," on A, hopefully you'll catch the bounce."
"1579740","1585920"," These places I'm writing this probably in the best places, but you got A down here as a dip. "
"1585920","1593200"," If we reverse and start to trade lower, you would add to your position."
"1593440","1594680"," Let's say you go 10%, right?"
"1597400","1598780"," You go 30%."
"1599320","1601160"," That's now you're in 40%. "
"1601160","1604760"," And then up here, you're going to add 60% if we start to swing higher, right?"
"1606320","1608940"," For a trade higher back to 340."
"1609460","1613240"," Now, so there you go, right?"
"1614100","1619420"," If you buy the 10% here and it automatically starts from going higher, you can then start adding"
"1619420","1623300"," your 30% and your 60% as we continue to trade higher here."
"1624140","1624360"," Okay. "
"1625840","1627060"," Spreads of your friend here too."
"1627620","1633540"," And another thing to think about is if we trade sideways, like if we trade sideways in here, you"
"1633540","1634520"," can get fucked too, right?"
"1634620","1637800"," If you're a bull, because eventually you're going to get that decline."
"1638680","1643860"," Or we end up trading down here and then boom, as we head into Friday, there goes your decline. "
"1643860","1649400"," Now, if you're bullish down here, you're like, happy missed the trade yesterday."
"1650360","1651860"," We're going to break out and above."
"1658420","1661260"," It's the same regime, right?"
"1661540","1666600"," You're waiting for confirmation to get bullish above that channel. "
"1667460","1671440"," And then you take this trade here to go higher."
"1673000","1673920"," Hold up."
"1675380","1676380"," Close that out there. "
"1681310","1682450"," Move this over here."
"1687730","1689310"," Okay, I'm not going to talk about that."
"1689450","1689830"," You guys want?"
"1689990","1699270"," Well, since there's a sector index at 8.2 versus 10.6 in the prior month, 7 index at 0 "
"1699270","1702570",".2 versus 23.4 in the prior month. "
"1704350","1710270"," And if that wasn't bad enough, all this week, we've got huge economic calendar, right?"
"1710690","1716230"," Get the Fed not speaking, but every single day this week, you've got all the nasties, right?"
"1716630","1717950"," We had durable goods this morning."
"1718910","1721350"," Consumer confidence index later today."
"1726720","1731340"," You got pending home sales, which we kind of know now what to expect. "
"1732380","1733920"," Thursday, we've got claims."
"1735400","1736720"," And then Friday, we got all kinds of inflation."
"1737660","1738160"," Dog shit. "
"1738300","1743160"," We just have basically a full week of nasties."
"1743160","1752720"," And today, right, we've got one, two, three, four, five, six."
"1753240","1756660"," We've got six trading days until the fourth. "
"1757560","1762160"," And even within that, we've got ADP and plenary port on Wednesday, the fifth, right?"
"1762620","1763800"," We got claims on Thursday."
"1764660","1766380"," We've got non-farm payroll on Friday."
"1766620","1769560"," We've got a huge two weeks ahead of us, right?"
"1769560","1771400"," We've got tons of stuff going on. "
"1771560","1772880"," All of this is just volatility."
"1773860","1774580"," Tons of it."
"1775060","1776080"," It's lined up. "
"1776220","1781980"," It's like the last airing of dirty laundry heading into FOMC."
"1782380","1785400"," Just tons of dirty laundry heading into FOMC."
"1785400","1789580"," You've got a nice bounce down below here on the spy down here at 420. "
"1790380","1791360"," We're close to it."
"1791460","1792280"," Looks like we had some buyers."
"1792280","1794140"," We're able to get any cheaper than retail traders. "
"1797440","1799160"," A nice little buy down below here."
"1799200","1801060"," We'll see how much this can hold up."
"1801060","1802860"," We're going to be looking for today. "
"1803440","1804180"," Our sellers."
"1804460","1805540"," There's a little band of sellers here."
"1805880","1810180"," Another band above at $4.23.50. Looks like the same kind of trading as yesterday, right?"
"1810720","1814300"," And then we've got $4.24.50. Some more sellers piling in above here. "
"1814640","1816120"," Any dip being bought here."
"1816580","1818620"," Looks like sellers are going to jump back in again."
"1819240","1819780"," So I'm going to wait. "
"1820720","1822460"," I'll probably miss this trade."
"1822640","1826740"," German Defense Minister Lambert just commenting at the Rammstein air space."
"1826820","1829620"," They are going to consider more weapons supplies to the Ukraine. "
"1830300","1833440"," This is after they agreed to send tanks to the Ukraine."
"1834460","1837060"," So right in here, you've got more sellers above, right?"
"1837380","1845560"," Right away at $4.23.50, $4.24.50. And I want you to pay attention to this here, right?"
"1845720","1852020"," These sellers disappeared above, but they're probably hiding somewhere in here at $4.26. Probably"
"1852020","1855220"," waiting right here to come back down and re-short again."
"1857120","1861580"," You've got some resistance above at $4.31. Okay. "
"1864240","1866020"," So I'll probably look in the buy a dip."
"1866040","1870800"," It's probably down at $4.20. We'll see if this reverses some more."
"1873030","1874710"," I'm going to see these sellers here. "
"1874810","1877250"," Do you see these sellers on the right hand side?"
"1877830","1879030"," Just the monster sellers."
"1880410","1885390"," Big buyers down below at $4.20. So I'm going to look to see if we can touch it."
"1886030","1887730"," Like touching a peepee or something, right?"
"1887970","1889690"," Like touch just the tip of it. "
"1892510","1893510"," It was right down here."
"1894710","1901690"," Maybe we can grab like, maybe we can grab like a little peepee touch and then boom."
"1902590","1904150"," Get a little rocket ship higher. "
"1904350","1905790"," There's $4.26 without that."
"1906230","1906930"," This was support."
"1907170","1908270"," Now it's resistance, right?"
"1908450","1910030"," This is now R1. "
"1911610","1914150"," You've got some sellers still hiding up here."
"1914890","1917790"," And this is that $4.31 that you're looking for above here."
"1917990","1920470"," These are more hiding sellers above here. "
"1921710","1926150"," We'll see if we can touch down here and at least maybe take a trade here."
"1926850","1932430"," And we know that safety is down below at $4.15. There is some more vol at $4.18. You"
"1932430","1934690"," can throw that on your charts if you want."
"1934850","1937930"," There's a little bit of support at $4.18 as well. "
"1939090","1939790"," So we did the calendar."
"1940730","1941730"," We did the charts."
"1943090","1946150"," We're going to look at the market breadth indicator. "
"1947790","1948930"," We'll put this up here."
"1949930","1951270"," And we were down below yesterday."
"1951270","1952670"," We actually slammed down below. "
"1952930","1953770"," I was watching it yesterday."
"1953770","1955350"," We're down at 17."
"1955830","1960590"," I think 17% around $4.18. We know that we bounced down here. "
"1960690","1963070"," We can get multiple days, right?"
"1963450","1964830"," So you watch my cursor down here."
"1965510","1967890"," You know that you can get quick bounces higher."
"1968270","1969350"," And then we come back down again. "
"1970590","1971330"," And we are down."
"1971590","1972370"," We're above it right now."
"1972390","1974010"," We are slightly bullish, believe it or not. "
"1975270","1982170"," And we do see that the consumer staples CNS has come down slightly."
"1982750","1984230"," But it didn't come down yesterday."
"1984230","1986870"," It was still holding on down here. "
"1987010","1988260"," So we did touch briefly yesterday."
"1989310","1994770"," I think we were down at 2.21. I think we're at 2.10 yesterday."
"1995490","1996150"," Maybe slightly lower. "
"1996410","1998190"," But when I checked in for a moment, it was close."
"1999610","2001110"," So I'm going to wait here."
"2001350","2002990"," This is the thing with market breadth indicator. "
"2002990","2005750"," You want to be also checking everything else out, right?"
"2005910","2007710"," Do we have any more volatility coming down the road?"
"2008390","2009890"," Do we've got any events coming up?"
"2009970","2011370"," Do we have what's going on in the marketplace?"
"2012950","2016410"," I was looking at this yesterday for the 10% decline."
"2016830","2018030"," Where is the 10% decline?"
"2018750","2024350"," If you guys want to know where that 10% decline is from peak to trough."
"2025570","2027470"," It's down here at 4051. "
"2027910","2030170"," If you touch this, see up here?"
"2030850","2032470"," If you touch this up here, right?"
"2034430","2035490"," If we touch this."
"2035870","2036970"," I'm all about touching today."
"2037010","2037450"," I don't know why. "
"2039170","2040150"," If you touch this."
"2041750","2045590"," Now, if you were to, if you were to, there's probably some people out there like fuck you, Cap."
"2045790","2046270"," We've already done. "
"2046910","2048190"," We've already had a market crash."
"2049770","2051250"," But this is going back to March 29th."
"2052330","2053350"," You kind of have to happen. "
"2053630","2055570"," It has to kind of happen over a few days."
"2056130","2060150"," So I'm going to give the bear, I'm going to give the, I'm going to tell you that."
"2060150","2062350"," It can't really happen over like. "
"2063250","2064090"," Hold on."
"2064190","2066489"," Over like the course of a month for it to be called a market crash."
"2067030","2069850"," It has to happen over like three, four, five, six. "
"2070050","2072530"," I'll give you seven, maybe 10 trading days."
"2073170","2074810"," But it can't happen over the course of a month."
"2075130","2076290"," This is a decline of correction. "
"2077449","2080449"," But from here, this is April 21st."
"2080670","2085310"," If we were to break down the next couple days, you could technically call this a market crash."
"2085570","2088330"," Anything 10% or more would be a market crash. "
"2091320","2098200"," With that said, I would expect a reaction on 4.15. We'll make it another kick ass relief rally."
"2099380","2101780"," And I don't think the market breath indicator is done."
"2101960","2103180"," I don't think we're done going down. "
"2103340","2103880"," Here's my point."
"2106730","2110970"," So this was the part about managing that trade that I want to talk to you about."
"2111370","2113110"," We didn't have really have a good example of it. "
"2114330","2116170"," We have a really good example of it."
"2118190","2120310"," After we discussed making this trade."
"2120310","2124370"," I was also talking to you about how to manage the trade. "
"2125210","2127050"," And so I'm not quite ready for it."
"2127410","2127910"," It's close."
"2128670","2129830"," Just not quite there yet. "
"2130890","2133770"," So we'll look again and see if we can catch this bounce down below."
"2134850","2137150"," You could also take a condor here."
"2137870","2140770"," It might be a safe bet taking some kind of a widespread condor. "
"2141210","2145850"," You're not going to expect us to trade higher than 4.31. Right?"
"2146090","2147610"," You don't expect us to trade higher than here."
"2147610","2151170"," Unless you had some headline news that we don't know about."
"2151570","2154570"," You're not going to expect us really to trade below here. "
"2157240","2159600"," Unless we get some negative headline news."
"2160060","2161180"," Some really horrible reporting."
"2162200","2166220"," So you could possibly run with a nice condor in here. "
"2167060","2171220"," We try to get back to this zone heading into Wednesday expiry."
"2175360","2176960"," Oh my fucking elbow."
"2177960","2178800"," So I tore. "
"2179560","2181740"," I don't know exactly which muscles I tore in here."
"2183240","2187880"," Testifying now in Washington D.C. Saying the supplemental request for the Ukraine will be coming"
"2187880","2188360"," shortly."
"2190520","2193260"," Looks like it looks like the U.S. is getting hawkish on. "
"2195080","2196920"," Hawkish on Russia, huh?"
"2197800","2199960"," I guess that post this morning was poignant."
"2205360","2205880"," Cool."
"2206680","2208380"," I was at 14% yesterday. "
"2209220","2210540"," Yeah, I think I looked at it."
"2210720","2216200"," I was in and out yesterday trying to get some permits yesterday."
"2217300","2218360"," Some building permits. "
"2218800","2220840"," So I was in and out all day long yesterday."
"2221180","2222560"," I saw it at 17%."
"2222560","2225280"," I didn't see it get as low as 15 or 14. "
"2225460","2225760"," I wasn't."
"2225900","2227100"," I was like here and not here."
"2228420","2231180"," Our total got down to 11.7 yesterday. "
"2232080","2232680"," You take a picture."
"2233000","2233080"," Fuck."
"2233300","2233380"," Yeah. "
"2237110","2239470"," TQQ is having a three six and say channel support."
"2240950","2243290"," That's my PPP hilarious."
"2244550","2244910"," Yes. "
"2246570","2247810"," We'll watch this down here."
"2248530","2249390"," Keep an eye on it."
"2253550","2255770"," The, uh, hold on here. "
"2255870","2256530"," Just give me a quick second."
"2256910","2260330"," A little bit of a roll on the VIX at the moment."
"2262150","2263070"," Let me just a second. "
"2263170","2263830"," I got to do some stuff."
"2268140","2268500"," Whoo."
"2284080","2285100"," Snowdenchromantly hair out of Europe. "
"2285340","2288600"," We're seeing a report get circulated that Russia has a similar effect."
"2288600","2291920"," We're seeing a little bit of a suspended gas supplies to Poland under the Yumal contract."
"2295200","2296340"," Take a look at a."
"2297780","2302260"," This report saying at this point there's been no communication from the Russian side as yet to"
"2302260","2307020"," whether this is the fulfillment of the ultimatum that President Putin has recently threatened. "
"2308840","2313520"," Someone I trust on Twitter this morning said by gas calls on the bell today."
"2317700","2319100"," I some more natural gas."
"2321390","2326770"," U.S. equity markets are on the lows here as we're less than a little more than 45 minutes to"
"2326770","2328270"," the European cash equity close. "
"2328650","2332630"," The DAX and the Spanish ibex have moved into negative territory."
"2338320","2340020"," Give me four fifteen today."
"2343600","2348920"," Oh, we can look at Tesla again. "
"2350420","2351980"," We'll run up Tesla in the background."
"2357330","2358570"," I got to meet some stuff here."
"2359350","2360290"," I can hear people in the background. "
"2360290","2363990"," They are seeing some modest pressure in the polar gladi above 440."
"2363990","2370470"," The U.S. dollar index at session highs and these latest headlines coming out around Europe and"

"2408430","2408650"," Europe."
"2408730","2412450"," It's still unclear whether or not this will affect gas supplies to other parts of Europe."
"2431690","2435770"," Look at that beautiful break and bounce below on four twenty forty nine. "
"2435790","2441950"," We'll see if this support level holds or if we continue to trade down to that four to four fifteen"
"2441950","2442410"," level."
"2442870","2445570"," I do want you to be aware if we take a look here."
"2447390","2448270"," See if I can. "
"2456410","2458530"," It's a little bit more rug pulling going."

"2460730","2465030"," You've got a little bit of rug pulling going on down here at that four eighteen I was talking to"
"2465030","2465310"," you about. "
"2466690","2475950"," And then firmer support down below between four fifteen sixty seven and four"
"2475950","2478190"," fourteen eighty three."
"2490690","2491210"," Yeah."
"2491310","2492290"," Have you been paying attention?"
"2492490","2498490"," Are those are those I haven't checked back on Facebook to see if they're still long those trades or"
"2498490","2498710"," not. "
"2499290","2504450"," Are they are they are those are those calls still in is my question."
"2505510","2506510"," How you doing, Winky?"
"2509340","2510040"," Good to see brother."
"2515840","2519980"," You guys want to look at Tesla chart one more time the Tesla the Tesla chart. "
"2530530","2531150"," Same chart."
"2531410","2533770"," But news and haven't haven't haven't changed much of it."
"2538600","2542240"," Hopefully going to see some kind of a response down here. "
"2542860","2544680"," Eight seventy right nine oh five."
"2544680","2548440"," This is normal by the difference in before right or this was resistance too."
"2549140","2552860"," We're going to be looking currently right where we're at right now. "
"2553300","2555940"," Nine oh three and eight seventy eight."
"2556040","2556880"," We'll take a look here."
"2559200","2559980"," And that sucks. "
"2561320","2563460"," This is from this from last week, right?"
"2579600","2581620"," Decent support down here at nine hundred."
"2584520","2586440"," No real support at eight ninety."
"2586920","2588860"," This is what we were looking at here yesterday. "
"2592760","2595560"," So it looks like it's even lower that one price target."
"2595760","2597320"," We should move this lower down eight fifty."
"2608820","2610860"," And that does seem like real support down here. "
"2610920","2612380"," I'm going to put real support down here."
"2613120","2616580"," Change that from this is this is from last week couple weeks."
"2618220","2619840"," On the earnings report, right?"
"2620140","2621460"," Can't break out of this channel. "
"2621900","2623140"," Reversal come back down."
"2623960","2626100"," And we'll start we'll start buying lower lows."
"2630530","2633990"," I don't know if this holds coming into FOMC. "
"2634170","2636450"," I think that you I think it's easy to see a fifty."
"2636930","2638770"," You make it a reaction bounce here."
"2639030","2643090"," But I think you still I think even if you get a bounce here, you're still going to trade lower. "
"2646650","2649530"," So I price target ultimately is a fifty one on Tesla."
"2651010","2652330"," Can we get lower?"
"2652330","2654090"," Yeah, like Russia headline news."
"2654430","2656070"," FOMC shit headline news. "
"2656650","2659330"," This would be the break of the spy down to three sixty."
"2659510","2660650"," We were talking about earlier this morning."
"2662910","2664130"," If that were to happen. "
"2664710","2669080"," It would be a fucking utter and complete fucking bloodbath."
"2669940","2670300"," To the market."
"2671000","2672900"," So do we see a bounce here today?"
"2673640","2674100"," More than likely. "
"2674820","2676480"," This is pretty decent support down here."
"2676760","2677160"," Nine hundred."
"2677700","2678940"," Intraday kind of support. "
"2680020","2682820"," Not the major moves the market makes end of day."
"2682820","2686480"," We could possibly get as low as nine oh two."
"2687140","2690160"," To eight ninety seven six ninety six. "
"2690160","2691020"," Believe it or not."
"2691400","2693700"," Now we begin to grind down here at any point."
"2694100","2695660"," Next next price targets eight fifty. "
"2696360","2698460"," It's a pretty pretty big ball down here."
"2699340","2701540"," There is some but there are some buyers here."
"2701640","2704820"," Your major buyers are down at eight fifties. "
"2704920","2705640"," Just be aware of that."
"2705840","2708880"," If the support was to break on Amazon or Tesla."
"2709180","2710620"," We already know what Amazon is doing. "
"2711220","2711900"," As well."
"2712080","2713620"," We know what Apple is doing as well."
"2723680","2724160"," Yeah. "
"2724220","2725760"," I just showed you a test on book map tonight."
"2726900","2728900"," I think I just showed you a test a couple minutes ago."
"2730520","2731520"," Good morning everybody. "
"2731900","2732460"," The king cow."
"2732680","2732980"," How are you?"
"2733180","2733420"," Good morning."
"2733940","2738020"," The secretary of state blanket saying reaching a nuclear agreement with the Rand would not take"
"2738020","2742740"," away from your ability to address Rand's other activities. "
"2743800","2747780"," I fucked up my arm so bad that I am like I'm literally."
"2747780","2749800"," I can't put my arm down."
"2750000","2751900"," I can't put like I can't reach it to my head. "
"2752780","2754940"," I can't reach my head with my left arm."
"2755620","2762540"," And I can't put my we have a million dollar in a million dollar call golden ticket just come in."
"2766260","2768100"," Like I wouldn't be able to wipe my ass. "
"2769240","2774660"," And I wouldn't be able to stick my hand in my mouth."
"2775080","2775800"," My left arm."
"2776720","2780440"," I can't even cheat on my right hand and jerk off left handed right now. "
"2781280","2784120"," I can't cheat on my fucking right hand right now."
"2786940","2790680"," Said a million dollar call come in on plug."
"2799620","2802940"," It was May 20th 23.5 C."
"2808630","2809650"," Not out of that place. "
"2810730","2812130"," Kind of like that trade."
"2813370","2816630"," But I don't know that I like it today or right where we are."
"2816630","2819490"," I think I'd like it deeper down. "
"2819970","2820970"," So keep an eye on that trade."
"2821490","2822930"," I like that Facebook trade."
"2822990","2826290"," What you do is you monitor the trade that's taken. "
"2827190","2828270"," So as a golden ticket."
"2829330","2833510"," It's May 20th 23.5 C for 1.1 million dollars."
"2834870","2837570"," So you'd find the trade in the options chain. "
"2838410","2839950"," Keep your eyes on it."
"2840690","2844050"," And the key on that trade would be they may be trying to protect."
"2844050","2848130"," Usually with these golden tickets sometimes I think they use it to protect a ticker that they're"
"2848130","2848970"," longing in stock. "
"2850230","2857870"," The idea would be if we trade lower see if they remain in the trade or if they roll them"
"2857870","2862450"," into another million dollar position and then you take it and follow them with it into May."
"2863750","2866290"," But I still think that plug can go deeper."
"2866290","2872050"," I'll give a price target and plug of what will we give for a price target and plug. "
"2893360","2893840"," Man."
"2894600","2895900"," Like good fucking plunge."
"2896860","2898400"," The depth of how believe it or not. "
"2902340","2904060"," Remember I see shit like this?"

"2950120","2950880"," the corrective mood."
"2951500","2954080"," And it is still correcting, believe it or not."
"2961360","2962120"," What is that?"
"2962360","2964140"," 14, 19, 10, 61. "
"2965360","2967420"," And there's your five bucks or seven bucks."
"2981230","2981710"," Yikes."
"2985330","2987570"," It's like zero dollars down there. "
"2990530","2992110"," Fucking crazy town."
"3002340","3004160"," Can't make this so sloppy."
"3006120","3007920"," Sloppy fucking charting. "
"3011160","3012860"," Well, what are you doing wrong here?"
"3020860","3022320"," Kind of fucked up doing this."
"3033270","3034610"," Oh, size."
"3036250","3040250"," And from Lincoln's in, yes, we'll be sending diplomats back to Ukraine this week. "
"3045310","3050570"," If you get a break, if this breaks here, that white line breaks right there."

"3147900","3157130"," want that break and another thing to note here would be this if you were to buy this dip right"
"3157130","3166790"," now on plug then you want to see that break out above your you can buy these dips as long"

"3492470","3502030"," don't roll into integrate into the YouTube way of doing things then what they do is they"
"3502030","3509530"," they won't show your videos publicly like you won't come up in algorithms for to be discovered and"

"3543110","3543230"," kind"
"3545060","3555280"," of"
"3555280","3565220"," an odd just continue to grind lower here on the spy yeah I can bring up Apple you"
"3567500","3571420"," think that's what I'm gonna see is potential to be sell the rumor and buy the news how many of"
"3571420","3577360"," the effects is going to predict around earnings this week yeah yeah small community is is awesome"
"3577360","3585660"," there well there's more people here than than talk and chat there are people that log in and play"
"3585660","3593240"," the play the broadcast in the background so you'll see people will they'll just turn it on listen"
"3593240","3599380"," to someone talking in the background as they trade their day or they're in their office and they"
"3599380","3607420"," don't they don't actually interact in the in chat with us because in the background I can see that"
"3607420","3612180"," they say have like a background I have like a screener that I can look at and see how many"
"3612180","3617400"," people are actually tuned in and it never matches what YouTube always they love that nice number of"
"3617400","3624680"," 200 but it's like a thousand so okay so moving on here for a minute so we'll bring up Apple"
"3624680","3634490"," we'll look at TLT what we should talk about that too"
"3634490","3643140"," so there's probably there's a couple things you got to talk about here so some things with with"
"3643140","3647220"," some like house cleaning stuff to talk about at some point I'm meant to talk about on Friday but we"
"3647220","3653880"," didn't have time to talk about on Friday so we're gonna talk about because it's hard for me to it's"
"3653880","3661980"," it's difficult for me to live stream like nine o'clock in the morning or nine thirty or whatever"
"3661980","3668400"," eight thirty whatever it is that I come on it's difficult to live stream from like you know like"
"3668400","3674660"," from nine thirty or even earlier sometimes to four in the afternoon for me right now it's a"
"3674660","3681240"," challenge so I don't know if it's better to I don't know if it's if it's a mix if it's"
"3681240","3687160"," like if it's like I only come on a key pivot moment live streaming or if you guys prefer the"
"3687160","3691740"," live streaming I'm fine with doing live streaming but if I do the live streaming I probably have to"
"3691740","3697480"," have I have to add some I've had a lot of advertisers that contact me including YouTube but they"
"3697480","3701960"," want to advertise they want me to stream in other places to them to stream on like twitch and"
"3701960","3708340"," Facebook and some other platforms there's some financial platforms out there they want me to stream"
"3708340","3715480"," so I guess if I if I was going to continue with like everyday live streams I have to monetize"
"3715480","3722720"," at some point because it's time-consuming or if I do a blend I don't know if it's like a"
"3722720","3727360"," blend we've talked about this I think in the in the beginning and we're now revisiting once more"
"3727360","3734100"," with past couple weeks where maybe I only live stream when I can and then I do recorded videos I"
"3734100","3741400"," used to do a synopsis for the day and tell you what to look forward to and you're trading day"
"3741400","3745460"," I don't know if it's if you're like hey it's fine to just post on Twitter or if it's if"
"3745460","3751960"," you can't stream can you make a video I don't know I don't know what the blend is but right"
"3751960","3757580"," now it's a challenge in the other thing too in this is summertime's coming so we have to talk about"
"3757580","3767460"," that right as summertime approaches this state will say hopefully in coming weeks about a"
"3767460","3775480"," national security strategy China as summertime approaches the markets going to get lot less"
"3775480","3779880"," volatile believe it or not I know you don't think that's true but it should it should get less well"
"3779880","3783320"," there should be when summers here I don't know how many of you got some of you guys know a"
"3783320","3787840"," long-time investors and traders but some of you or day traders I don't know maybe your day traders"
"3787840","3793760"," out there but as a day trader there are seasons where we could sit here all fucking day long for"
"3793760","3801620"," weeks and you'll see me taking a nap in the background like that's how slow shit gets so I have"
"3801620","3807300"," to think about do we do like a show where maybe you bring winky on and we're like a team"
"3807300","3813640"," or pinky or your wife's boyfriend or like we switch people out so we could just talk about shit"
"3813640","3820180"," that's not market related maybe it's market related maybe it isn't is that something where we limit"
"3820180","3826140"," the number of live streams that we do when we get into those times of the year I don't know"
"3826140","3831600"," what the blend is if it's interviewing people one of the things that kind of pisses me off is like"
"3832980","3842620"," I'll get on like I don't know what's picked that it pisses me off but I'll get on like"
"3842620","3852190"," spaces or some like a lot of people do shows out there on YouTube or on Twitch or on spaces"
"3852190","3857950"," or I'm like even Twitter tries to get me to do a little stupid shit but it's not stupid shit"
"3857950","3864150"," but you know what it is it's you know what it is that I'm like I'm not quite like so"
"3864150","3868810"," if I wanted to watch CNBC I'd watch CNBC if I wanted to watch Fox Business News and watch Fox"
"3868810","3875330"," Business News if there's something important to figure out I can usually find it on like YouTube or"
"3875330","3879290"," something somebody's like yeah this is what tail risk is I can usually find a video on tail risk"
"3879290","3888830"," figure it out but oftentimes when I watch a lot of live streams or I watch interview shows"
"3888830","3893770"," that are put on by people like me like retail investors I get kind of fucking bored I got to"
"3893770","3899810"," be honest with you they either get bored or it's like a fuckfest it's like it's like two guys"
"3899810","3905650"," fucking sticking their dicks in each other's mouths and sucking each other off and this even"
"3905650","3911690"," extends to furrows right you put furrows on these shows you get like two I watch I don't watch them"
"3911690","3916850"," actually but I've watched like on YouTube sometimes I watch like recordings of two furrows sitting"
"3916850","3921470"," around and talking and oftentimes it's like there's a couple live shows on YouTube that I've"
"3921470","3925890"," watched during the daytime and it's like they got the fucking the old-school like family guy where"
"3925890","3931230"," I'd be like Z104 one there's like all the effects in the background like kind of stupid shit like"
"3931230","3936890"," that shit's all fucking goofy and then when you get two guys like talking about complicated"
"3936890","3943590"," subjects I don't know it's good to watch when I need to reference it but to tune into that shit"
"3943590","3947990"," all day long every day it's like fucking putting a knife or gun to my head and being like I"
"3947990","3954130"," want to fucking shoot myself listening to this shit right so I don't know what the evolution of the"
"3954130","3959570"," of the stream is I don't know but I feel like I want to feel like I want if I"
"3959570","3964430"," was listening to somebody I kind of want like I don't want to trade alone right like trade with"
"3964430","3973950"," other people I like the idea of keeping it light is important I don't really want to hear someone"
"3973950","3983930"," fucking getting into the getting into like the ratios of the credit markets and TLT and why the"
"3983930","3988550"," market well like the technical side of why the markets going on I kind of just want like a friend"
"3988550","3993630"," there kind of want someone there to talk in the background while I'm doing my thing I guess that's"
"3993630","3998430"," what I want it you know it's funny too because it's not quite I'm not really I used to like"
"3998430","4002590"," Joe Rogan way back in the day like way back in the day when Joe Rogan had a used to"
"4002590","4008290"," have a kick-ass livestream right he would he would ask people questions and just let them talk and"
"4008290","4011430"," that's when it was a really good livestream because they were he would just bring on interesting"
"4011430","4016470"," people and it wasn't always necessarily what they were excellent in they would just start talking"
"4016470","4026090"," about a shit that was relevant to I guess to to to what would you call it to news that's"
"4026090","4030650"," important to people so maybe you could do it where you you interview people but you keep it light"
"4030650","4035390"," geared towards the market like a market slant on it but don't get too technical guess every once in"
"4035390","4040010"," a while I could get technical but you really want to bring on like the weirdos out there you want"
"4040010","4045610"," to like interview the people that that are fucking astrologists and why are they trading it with"
"4045610","4052510"," astrology or why is so like you know what no one ever ever interviews like an nape like like"

"4140840","4146979"," um so i don't know if that's what it turns into or not into summertime uh maybe it's an interview"
"4146979","4152560"," show maybe it's uh with a partner or something that does the show with me or maybe there's someone"

"4195920","4203920"," right um you know it's not bizarre it's just it gets gets fucking boring and so yeah i don't know"
"4203920","4208120"," if you get if you get something like that going in uh in a live stream it'd probably pay more"

"4402060","4407380"," you at key times they sell you indicators it's all you all kinds of nonsense but it makes sense to"
"4407380","4410920"," do that if you're making your money that way it makes sense for you to show up for those things"
"4410920","4416900"," when you're making your money that way um and i don't so uh for me it's a challenge right you're"
"4416900","4422780"," trying to balance all these things at the same time uh and then we're coming into summer time where"
"4422780","4428940"," shit should slow down at some point there should be like a slowdown um in the market at some point"
"4428940","4433100"," for the summer months so we have to figure out a way to keep keep y'all entertained doing that"
"4433100","4439080"," i'm i i can't tell you that uh i can be here all summer long day in day out if"
"4439080","4443800"," we don't have fun should talk about right got to get some guests on here probably need to get a"
"4443800","4448240"," partner so i'm going to talk to you even it's like part-time where it's like two people on a"
"4448240","4453520"," show or it's um they're sitting in uh and running the stream at those times this is something"
"4453520","4459480"," something or it's important videos when we're not doing this right if it's summer time and it gets"
"4459480","4464660"," slow maybe we put out a video and say this is what we expect today to friday uh something like"
"4464660","4468560"," that and if anything changes we live stream right if we hit a key pivot and said oh shit what"
"4468560","4472260"," the fuck's gonna happen next how do we get it do you get up a live stream at that point"
"4473480","4481420"," how so we got support here on apple at 155 and then of course key support that 150 this is"
"4481420","4489260"," the one to know about right 145 not as important as it would it seem right in 140 looks like"
"4489260","4495120"," key support is that 150 number let's look let's look down below let's"
"4495120","4505040"," look um 150 and there's a reason for that"
"4505040","4514360"," too you start breaking down that one below that 150 and uh there's concern right 145 140 that"
"4514360","4521280"," there's conflict below 145 is where you start free falling here now it is showing that there's"
"4521280","4528120"," massive fires down below 140 145 uh so this would lend itself against the market selling off below"
"4528120","4535200"," 405 but it does leave the door open to it uh to 405 so you can see here that there"
"4535200","4542420"," is there is room to buy a dip down here 150 and even lower to 145 and we'll look at"
"4542420","4550960"," apple again real quick here beautiful bounce on apple down here 158"
"4550960","4560680"," almost to the pen and you can see these dip fires down below here on apple right"
"4560680","4566380"," it's been a great stock to trade down here we know that the cell the world is down here 140"
"4568930","4577690"," right we know that the dip buying regime is down here 145 and 150 and i'm still having problems"
"4577690","4587690"," with the fucking arm right so in the and if we have this is not this is reminds"
"4587690","4594050"," me of a lot of amazon right i used to trade just so you know i used i spent many"
"4594050","4600390"," years trading apple apple was like my bread and fucking butter i knew every single thing about"
"4600390","4605470"," apple all i did was eat breathe and shit apple for years this is the place where i came to"
"4605470","4612290"," make my regular money like start off with i think amd and then i switched over to apple there's a"
"4612290","4620990"," few other tickers that i've traded exclusively amazon tesla now with all this being said"
"4620990","4632890"," corporate debt right talk about corporate debt if"
"4632890","4642020"," we gave back it's 2020 down here right if we talk about giving it all back right this is march"
"4642020","4652020"," lows down here sometimes you make this nice the consolidation right nice swing up consolidation and"
"4652020","4656600"," sometimes you get those dips for 10 minutes now to the close of cash equity trade across europe"
"4656600","4661220"," we've seen european borsus come under pressure with the extended declines in u.s stock markets once"
"4661220","4666160"," again the dax is now down 1.2 percent you know the lows of the day as we push towards"
"4666160","4672840"," the close the foot to 100 is given back nearly all the gains bond yields across europe as with here"
"4672840","4681300"," in the u.s are lower prices are firmer if we trade down to this 140 down here right and"
"4683130","4685870"," i have to do the math i don't have it in front of me but i could do the math"
"4685870","4695490"," to see if this is a decline to to that 405 i'm going to assume that it is right now"
"4695490","4699430"," but i don't think that it is i think 405 without doing the math because it's been split so many"
"4699430","4705450"," fucking times i'm going to assume this is 405 at 150 it's gonna be looking for a dip by it"
"4705450","4714630"," 150 on apple at a bottom to the market around 150 there is some concern if you have if you"
"4714630","4723530"," have anything any whispers about uh corporate debt not buying any longer apple holds a lot of our"
"4723530","4730870"," market up but that's where you get your 360 and that's where you get 140 oftentimes you'll get"
"4730870","4737210"," quick brief moments where you get below um you can get below you can believe believe or not get"
"4737210","4746460"," even lower so i'm going to give a bottom on apple of 140 um i wouldn't be shocked to see"
"4746460","4758100"," 150 um if the fed is is continue continue to be hawkish into their FMC um"
"4758100","4762500"," saying no matter what i don't we don't care about inflation and all that uh you're you're gonna see"
"4762500","4773500"," a low of 140 at some point so with that said right 140 is is probably a price target at"
"4773500","4780280"," some point the next three months but i would still be a dip buyer down here like again your ABCs"
"4780280","4787140"," down here every time you come down here you might think that it'll never excuse me that's a C you"
"4787140","4793980"," might think that it'll never trade down here uh but you have seen it already once before right uh i"
"4793980","4800040"," i think it's easy first to trade down to 145 i think that's easily on the table um so i"
"4800040","4807880"," think this this this getting down here is easy i think it's worth buying it down here on a longer"
"4807880","4816800"," time frame um so 145 set some alerts set an alert 150 cent alert 145 set alert at 140 on"
"4816800","4820140"," apple and whatever whatever it gets down there you can just wait whenever it gets down and you"
"4820140","4829440"," start adding do i think you add right today on on 158 where we are currently intraday possibly um"
"4829440","4834380"," but i still think there'll be a moment in here where you're going to catch a catch a dip i"
"4834380","4839220"," think even if we trade in here this is often like amazon you'll see these moves in there and then"
"4839220","4845720"," briefly once a year you'll see a move lower then briefly you'll see a move lower and uh you're not"
"4845720","4851380"," going to change that regime here until we until we make one of these trips higher then you'll be"
"4851380","4858260"," buying the dips down below here right so in this regime currently that apple is in you are looking"
"4858260","4868200"," for dips to buy right so anything down in here is what you're looking for so just just set"
"4868200","4873940"," some alerts if you get down here when we come into earnings report season or earnings season my"
"4873940","4884250"," only fears right now with apple in their earnings season would be any kind of um i'm trying"
"4884250","4888810"," to think of it i don't really have any i can't say that i really have any concerns with apple"
"4889450","4895430"," they've got a pretty i don't really have concerns with apple uh just weakness in the market market"
"4895430","4899930"," condition is looking for bottoms and trying to think of anything that could be negative of what"
"4899930","4904070"," apple they only have positive down the road if they have that apple car at any fucking point we"
"4904070","4908250"," know that the engineers have been rehired back on we know that there's that that apple's gonna"
"4909190","4914470"," gonna um we're gonna blast off when that takes place the only other concern that i would have here"
"4914470","4921170"," would just be pure profit taking right uh and that's where this trade came in right down here 140"
"4921170","4928650"," it's just pure profit taking uh so banks are long down here at 140 and it wouldn't surprise me to"
"4928650","4933390"," have some some fake ass you know some fake ass news just to get it down here for a minute"
"4933390","4940110"," so that they can they can long it once again i don't see 100 on the table 120 on the"
"4940110","4945190"," table maybe i need to move that probably need to probably need to move that it's probably not 120"
"4945190","4951970"," probably higher maybe i maybe it is well we'll just leave it at 125 we'll put another one down"
"4951970","4958590"," below here at 130 because these are gonna we know these are going to be key key bottoms if if"
"4958590","4966770"," if apple ever had some shitty news if it was created where they said oh you know no more corporate"
"4966770","4970810"," debt anymore right so that's where we're going to sell it off any kind of excuse like that that"
"4970810","4976290"," would work for me to get it down into this levels these levels you're like capital doesn't matter"
"4976290","4984410"," what the company doesn't matter it's just it's just fucking profit taking it really is i know"
"4984410","4990370"," there's some weakness being claimed because of the streaming with netflix use that as an excuse"
"4990990","5001630"," fuck my arm i'm buying bullish on apple i'll buy any of these levels down here 150 144 140 i'll"
"5001630","5007070"," buy any of this stuff and i think it's easy for us to get down to 145 if you had"
"5007070","5015410"," a bad er price target 140 i don't know him believes that but i have a price if we have"
"5015410","5024070"," bad er 140s on the table easily easily as a matter of fact most companies give back all their"
"5024070","5033870"," splits up so if you had an ugly fucking er 120 that's my ultimate bear case but if you had"
"5033870","5043560"," that man that's you're talking 360 down here this is 360 somewhere down in this vicinity let's take"
"5043560","5052000"," a look one last time we got 140 145 free falls down to that 120 that we talked about right"
"5052000","5073820"," 130 125 120 and you can see him expressed right here right 130 and 120 and 140 no"
"5073820","5083040"," uh keep we'll close apple out so what's my take on apple what's going to happen on apple you know"
"5083040","5090360"," apple's market conditions like um i guess if you want to know but when i take on apple is it's"
"5090360","5100500"," weird it's uh it's it really does depend on market conditions you would you can have a swing low to"
"5100500","5108420"," 120 on apple just due to market selling off uh not just the individual ticker they're just using"
"5108420","5116060"," excuse um for apple to sell off they could make any kind of excuse they want up they you know"
"5116060","5125900"," netflix i think deserve to some extent deserves where their price is just a second here"
"5125900","5135380"," netflix somewhat deserves where they are and somewhat doesn't they're fucking pr's a joke they're"
"5135380","5141700"," fucking pr they're not even airing dirty laundry at this point i i'm kind of scratching my head"
"5141700","5149180"," here on i don't know if it's apple p or it's an netflix pr or if it's just created created"
"5149180","5157140"," negativity towards netflix and so you have a sell-off on uh this is the netflix chart right a lot"
"5157140","5161260"," of the articles i'm seeing coming out of netflix i'm like is this actually from netflix or is this"
"5161260","5171260"," from short operations uh that want netflix to go lower and this is a good example if you had"
"5171260","5178100"," a bad year from from apple you might get more news come out negative towards apple that's not"
"5178100","5187190"," really relevant it's not really from their pr team um so that's my concern right you kind of see"
"5187190","5197170"," that same thing happening now with uh uh with netflix um so that's tough and this is a hundred i"
"5197170","5202690"," mean this is giving back a lot here right uh it's happening right now so say it couldn't happen i"
"5202690","5208190"," know that apple and netflix are not the same company but they do follow the same kind of fucking uh"
"5208190","5214670"," or stocks tickers tend to follow these same kind of sell-offs right these highs if you were to if"
"5214670","5221610"," you were to just match up or compare netflix let's say sand atoms it's very similar um it's very"
"5221610","5227730"," similar with facebook very similar with with a lot of tickers you'll see uh distribution uh very"
"5227730","5235070"," similar uh so the news doesn't really matter um as much as as much as is it going to happen"
"5235070","5240350"," what is going to happen how low can we go if it happens right and so let's say it happens"
"5240350","5248350"," with apple let's let's say it happens with apple right apple was paid at 182 if it was going to"
"5248350","5253210"," give back everything this would be kind of what you'd expect right it kind of expects some kind of"
"5253210","5260870"," a steep sell-off in apple uh down below here and to come back into at least at least it's"
"5260870","5270390"," um it's uh it's uh excuse me pre-covid levels um or or or"
"5270390","5275770"," march let's say march lows of covid i don't think it's it only gets difficult for an excuse to be"
"5275770","5281550"," made up with any ticker uh to sell them off and it's weird because on one hand you're like oh"
"5281550","5285450"," it's because they're a bad company but on the other hand you know what it really is it's that we"
"5285450","5292800"," started our buying down here and uh we you know we took some profit now we took a lot of"
"5292800","5299640"," profit and you start to see that distribution right and then they rebuy it again um and they tell"
"5299640","5303580"," you all the good news once again and all of a sudden you see the ticker trade higher once again"
"5309080","5314620"," and there's your one there's your 120 down here right if he went down to 120 that would give back"
"5314620","5321700"," everything just to give back what was it give back this is not oh so 2020 is down here right"
"5321700","5325980"," i mean let's look at this i'm fucking this up right now so this is the 2020 lows down here"
"5328210","5333150"," if you had a bat let's say let's say apple give it all back that's $53.97 look at that"
"5333150","5342590"," shit i'm talking about coming down to 120 i don't think apple gives all this back"
"5342590","5351290"," but what if it did if apple gave it all back right down here"
"5351290","5360390"," i mean that would destroy that would just that would probably wreck some pension funds i don't"
"5360390","5366690"," think it goes that low i'm going to give my my lowest as as a 120 on apple i wonder"
"5366690","5371190"," what that after the math of this secretary say blank and saying yes is engaged with some countries"

"5424790","5434740"," somewhere down there whoa look at that we've paid sideways for the next fucking next two years on"
"5434740","5444190"," apple that would fucking blow right that's some work in there he did something nasty like that"
"5444190","5452880"," would fuck up a lot of fucking bulls who is down here looking trade-all was just sit down here"

"5509760","5517380"," it's very fucking breaking down from that trend maybe if you don't regain it it's something like"
"5517380","5525740"," this and then hope it stops if it doesn't and you get below this that's how fast it comes it"
"5525740","5533860"," comes it comes fast so if you're a bull you don't ever want to break this trend right here you"
"5533860","5541460"," don't ever want this to happen if you do break this right here you start breaking down below if it"

"5572290","5580210"," start stabbing you start breaking below here right this will consolidate down to the next level of"
"5580210","5589030"," support if this support breaks in here because we spent a lot of time here right see all this time"
"5589030","5596150"," we spent in the zone but if we do break this support this long time we spent down here then"
"5596150","5606010"," you'd be below it and you would be slamming down trying to maintain at 100 this is"
"5606010","5613590"," bigger time frame this is like over the course of a year six months a year um but maybe the"
"5613590","5619850"," bulls have some stuff going for right this zone here is nice i don't know i don't see you guys"
"5619850","5624830"," a long time traders but i want you guys to understand that if you're not a long time trader when"

"9954680","9958280"," you get that quick flush right there's two things that'll happen first thing that will happen is"
"9958280","9967440"," you'll panic and sell your longs and you'll get fucked as it trades higher uh right you end up"
"9967440","9973420"," getting this is where you this way rolls get panic and will sell too early uh the other thing is"

"9984600","9993160"," uh you can see this tag right in the middle here at four 2050 right um that point that i'm"
"9993160","9998380"," making to you is that when you're watching this four 2050 we're talking about and this 420 you"
"9998380","10002920"," might end up getting that quick slip below down below and then we rip higher so you can see the"
"10002920","10007680"," buyers are down a little more than 10 minutes because the year's also the trigger is $48 billion to"
"10007680","10017080"," your note auction at four eighteen or four or excuse me though at four 2050 and you can see"
"10017080","10022100"," continue large buyers down below at four eighteen so what does that mean to you as a bull it means"

"10028860","10037350"," uh make this your a at four 2050 you make that your a entry right if there's a quick flush"
"10037350","10044190"," down below here you don't buy anymore at right now you don't buy anymore and then you would add"

"19452320","19460020"," fairly wild swing in the spy or the cues you would see a much larger move higher a much larger"
"19460020","19465500"," move lower it would be interesting i guess the middle of the road thought would be that if they"
"19465500","19472140"," have okay earnings with good guidance maybe we could trade it sideways for the into tomorrow i"
"19472140","19478180"," guess that's possibility that would be on the table when we trade it so that would be option c and"
