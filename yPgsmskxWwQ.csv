"26560","27840"," Good morning, your wife's boyfriend."
"28040","28500"," Good to see you, brother."
"29320","29820"," As usual. "
"31900","32840"," Good morning, Joe."
"33500","35180"," Good morning, Jafar."
"35840","36760"," Joe, I got a talk to you. "
"36900","37500"," I'm going to give you a call today."
"39220","40420"," Juice 389, good morning."
"42780","44000"," How's everybody doing, Richard?"
"45020","45680"," Morning, brother. "
"46020","46320"," How are you?"
"48560","49600"," Good to see everybody."
"50660","51860"," Hey, Zon, good to see you."
"54840","56320"," Everybody's awake this morning, right?"
"56900","57480"," That's what I was thinking. "
"57680","58620"," Everybody's awake this morning."
"59520","60580"," Big, huge day today."
"62000","63780"," Big, huge day today. "
"65280","68940"," Big, big morning."
"75890","78030"," I have an alarm going out."
"78410","79390"," Good morning, Mihai. "
"80910","85990"," I wanted to say thank you, Mihai, for the support of the channel yesterday."
"90020","92980"," So it looks like extensions are going down in Rushview, Ukraine, right?"
"93220","93800"," Is that right or wrong?"
"94960","96040"," Morning, Josh, how are you?"
"96240","98060"," GP, JMac, Dilius."
"98360","99460"," Can you turn my alarm off, please?"
"100900","104780"," No, I can't hear it, but my headphones. "
"105720","106280"," Thanks, Lavi."
"107700","109440"," That may be my intern."
"110800","112500"," Good morning, not a suit, morning, Dilius. "
"113560","114860"," Alright, what are we going to do here?"
"115380","119100"," We're going to talk about this morning, we're going to have to go over."
"121200","127199"," We're going to talk about CPI, the number that everybody's thinking about."
"131090","134230"," Yeah, you have to go have a wonderful morning. "
"135750","136990"," The guy's been very busy."
"137170","138690"," He's got a bunch going on right now."
"141210","142670"," Oh, thank you, thank you, Mihai. "
"143650","145350"," Alright, so we're going to switch over this morning."
"145350","149150"," And we're going to take a look at some information."
"149150","150910"," I'm going to bring something else up here. "
"152110","153170"," Let's start here."
"155690","156750"," The Rusk is active."
"157070","158090"," Yeah, I saw that, right?"
"158550","160290"," The Diploats to leave. "
"160490","161350"," I saw that this morning."
"161670","162590"," Good morning, Euroboomer."
"162970","163270"," How are you?"
"167160","168040"," Yeah, later, donut. "
"168400","168700"," Good."
"168800","170220"," It's got a bunch of stuff going on right now."
"170460","171080"," He's busy. "
"171080","175120"," So we've got a, we'll start right away."
"175500","177780"," We have a lot to get out before 830 this morning."
"178400","184580"," Everybody knows that today is CPI, why the market is where it's at right now for CPI. "
"185860","189420"," We're going to roll into a bunch of information for you this morning."
"190340","193460"," Just a side note, some great earnings, right?"
"194060","198580"," We saw some great reports overnight and then again this morning, some great reports as well."
"198580","205000"," I was listening into some of the guidance calls and same story, right?"
"205140","206040"," Everybody's had a great year. "
"206660","207480"," Everybody's raising prices."
"208160","210360"," Their concerns are still in shortages and inflation."
"211180","212460"," It was interesting this morning. "
"213000","219660"," Some people are looking forward to shortages and inflation going down this year, whether there were"
"219660","223800"," hopes of that happening this year and a lot of the reports or the guidance reports that I was"
"223800","227000"," listening to, which is similar to what Teslas said, right?"
"227200","231520"," They hope that shortages are going to go down and then inflation decreases."
"234760","235820"," Rather calm out here."
"235980","236240"," Trust me. "
"236340","236440"," I live."
"236860","237340"," Oh, you do."
"238400","239820"," You live a hundred twenty kilometers away. "
"239940","240500"," It's very close."
"241820","242560"," That's concerning."
"244960","246140"," That's very, very close. "
"246420","248840"," 120 kilometers is not far away at all."
"250380","251300"," Bill, good morning."
"251540","251780"," How are you?"
"255450","256649"," Trying to get my coffee on. "
"258029","258670"," All right."
"259329","261610"," So we got some information out there for you this morning."
"262290","264990"," Now, with that all said, right, we saw some great reports this morning. "
"265170","266810"," Indexes didn't weren't phased by it."
"267290","268890"," They weren't hearing anything that had to do with it."
"269170","273810"," I do want you to see this fine profile chart here. "
"274670","280350"," And it was a 15-day, 15-minute chart, but I want you to see where we are right now."
"281890","283750"," And we're going to come back to this later."
"283990","286730"," We're going to touch on this on the regular chart here. "
"287290","293890"," If we get a good report this morning, we are looking for a good report to trade higher."
"294610","297230"," Like the report, the CPI report has to be good."
"297450","299490"," It has to be higher than expected. "
"300470","302730"," Let me see if I can get some for a little while."
"303070","305570"," I should say lower than expected, not higher."
"307090","309450"," I mean better or under. "
"309830","311990"," So we have a report that's under this morning."
"312690","318630"," We should trade much higher if we have a report this morning that is in line with estimates."
"319530","322990"," There's a fair chance that we're going to trade back down in here. "
"324110","328450"," Now, Spock, I have my thinks claiming 45-20 is support."
"328630","333830"," And it's right where this iceberg begins down here, but it wouldn't shock me if we had a report"
"333830","337270"," that was in line to have some consolidation down in here."
"339830","342170"," You guys remember back when we go back to events?"
"342910","345290"," We go back to the last minutes that we had. "
"346070","348330"," And it was kind of a thank you for playing kind of a moment."
"349590","353930"," They rolled everything up and then they traded higher or lower a day or two later."
"354750","356610"," And the report means nothing, right?"
"357810","359030"," So be careful for that this morning. "
"359070","364970"," If we get a report that's in line, we could wind up consolidating in here the next couple of days"
"364970","370190"," with maybe in a Friday with a ship, a move higher or lower, a Friday or Monday."
"371650","372930"," Now, three poor comes in lower."
"373410","374850"," We'll blast off higher. "
"375030","376690"," We're going to go rip and hire probably to."
"377610","381230"," I think Spock, I was saying 4600, but I think we can trade as high as 4640."
"382010","385510"," That's what I did a retracement on it. "
"385690","387710"," And that's what we tagged at 4640."
"387710","392050"," Now, if the CPI report comes in very hot, and I'll give you some numbers here in a little bit."
"393690","400970"," But if we get a hot CPI, it would be nothing for us to trade down here below 4520 and"
"400970","403010"," start eating into 4500. "
"403590","406590"," The concern with that is you see down here, right?"
"407510","409390"," There is no hell of a lot of support down here."
"409510","413470"," So you're going to expect us to come back and at least retest."
"415090","418510"," 4448.3. So be aware that that's that previous low down here. "
"419030","420330"," Retesting this, okay?"
"420970","423330"," So it would be nothing for us to come down here."
"423830","428350"," And if things are really ugly, it wouldn't be a shocker to come even further deeper, okay?"
"428770","432190"," If the report is super hot, way out of expectations."
"433330","437850"," Just be conscious of value or value or value or low point of control. "
"437850","442410"," And we are at value area high, area high right now for the last 15 days."
"443090","443930"," I'm going to get rid of this."
"444450","447250"," We're going to look at today's earnings, right?"
"447590","451050"," This morning we had Twitter, we had a great earnings data dog, banged it out. "
"452070","455830"," And note, we have a firm later tonight or after the closed day."
"455870","458390"," I'm interested in this one today, watching a firm."
"458930","465350"," And then I'm probably interested in watching Expedia, the Zillogloop group in cloud fairs, cloud"
"465350","466430"," flare as well. "
"467350","468510"," We pay attention to these."
"468890","473030"," Probably not going to be paying too much attention to Friday's report."
"476610","478750"," Friday's reports, I'm not going to pay too much attention to. "
"479210","484010"," But we do have a high number of reports today as well and into the overnight tomorrow."
"484770","489290"," Just like earlier this week, so we're going to pay attention to stuff as the day moves forward."
"489290","496130"," The one key on these reports though is they shouldn't be market moving or shaking like Uber can be"
"496130","501490"," and Walt Disney can be and adding that volatility into the end of the day, not as much as the"
"501490","501910"," day before. "
"502790","504530"," Just be aware of that stuff."
"505310","509410"," And then of course today, we have claims and continuing claims."
"509670","514150"," Normally I would say that claims and continuing claims would could have an impact and they"
"514150","514750"," typically do. "
"515289","523810"," But for today, the key right is the core CPI month to month and the consumer price index year to"
"523810","524230"," year."
"524730","526350"," Now both numbers are going to matter."
"526970","528050"," We are going to want. "
"529550","533110"," We have a, I think the expectation is a seven point."
"533530","535670"," Yeah, the median forecast is seven point two."
"536030","540250"," So if we come in higher than this by a few numbers, let's say come up with seven point five,"
"540450","542430"," seven point six, something like that. "
"542890","547710"," We'll sell the market guaranteed like seven point six and higher, seven point nine, eight, anything"
"547710","548410"," like that and then crazy."
"549050","552090"," We're selling the market if we're slightly in line like a point point or two off."
"552850","553890"," Not too bad, right. "
"554390","557950"," If we come in super low, let's say you can blow seven percent."
"559010","562770"," Well, that should be a number that we can start skyrocketing on."
"563070","564490"," We'll start trading higher from there. "
"564490","564750"," Okay."
"565190","567970"," And same thing for over here, this point zero four."
"568130","572190"," We want it to be much lower, like half and then if we go higher, like point six or seven"
"572190","573790"," point seven, watch out. "
"573890","574050"," Okay."
"574250","577090"," And this number right here can be much higher this month month."
"577430","580490"," And if we get this, we have a point six before. "
"580650","583090"," So if we come in like point nine or something, watch out."
"583150","583390"," Okay."
"583610","584630"," Seriously, watch out today. "
"585310","590210"," Even though we've traded higher into positive gamma, quote unquote positive gamma."
"590850","592790"," This market will sell at any moment."
"592990","596390"," Don't ever believe anybody out there that tells you that we can't sell this market at any time. "
"596850","600330"," I always hear from specifically recently on Twitter."
"600870","606310"," I've heard people say if you have conviction in where we're going, that it's going that way no"
"606310","606730"," matter what."
"606910","611370"," And I promise you that banks have their finger on the trigger every single day waiting for any"
"611370","612650"," moment to sell this market. "
"613130","615210"," They pay people to watch this stuff."
"615390","619250"," They've got programs to watch this stuff to sell their positions immediately."
"619250","620850"," So be conscious of that. "
"621750","624230"," This morning that we are at a pivotal moment."
"624490","627650"," If you guys want to think what I think about this, I'm kind of two sided on this."
"628010","630250"," I know we've got this month. "
"630250","631570"," We've got CPI this week."
"631750","633330"," We've got the minutes next week."
"633410","638030"," We've got OPEC's coming up on the 18th, all volatile situations and then boom, right into March. "
"638250","644630"," We were heading into the next CPI or the excuse me, the FMC meeting coming up in March where we're"
"644630","648650"," going to really talk about rates and they're going to do it live, which is not a good sign."
"649170","652210"," Yesterday, when they mentioned that we're going to do that live, it was concerning."
"653410","655650"," Most of the rate increases have been live meetings. "
"656670","658590"," So we're going to find, I think we're getting a rate raise."
"659130","659970"," Now, what does that mean?"
"660110","661170"," Do they soften the blow now?"
"662110","663250"," Because we should get some volatility."
"664130","667430"," If they're going to raise rates, my assumption would be that they're going to soften it today. "
"667990","673830"," If they're going to raise rates come March, they might trade us up just for that reason alone to"
"673830","675790"," soften the blow because there will be a blow."
"675990","676390"," That's the key."
"676390","680490"," If we get a rate raise, even if we know about it, there will be a reaction. "
"680710","682290"," There will be volatility surrounding that event."
"683130","684790"," And I don't think they want to sell the market."
"685150","687290"," They want to control where we are in the market right now. "
"689050","692050"," They're trying to manufacture the market so it doesn't burn."
"693050","697890"," So if you burn it today, you burn it out of OPEC and then you burn it on the FMC"
"697890","698250"," minutes."
"699490","700770"," It's not going to be pretty, right?"
"701250","705350"," You're going to end up burning this entire market down from today all the way into March 18th. "
"705350","707170"," And I don't think that's their goal."
"707530","710530"," I think their goal is to keep it in a range, right?"
"710630","712790"," You keep it below 480 and you keep it above 420."
"714410","715650"," That's their intent at least. "
"716230","720530"," So I think we either come in flat or..."
"720530","723050"," My number one guess is going to be flat."
"723970","728410"," And then my second guess would be that it comes in under."
"729670","732190"," And my third guess would be that it comes in super hot. "
"732190","735650"," Even though Biden came out and said the numbers don't look good."
"736650","739950"," It seemed like he did that with the unemployment numbers and then the employment numbers were good."
"740350","743590"," Now one rather thing on the employment number or the employment numbers, the other thing about the"
"743590","745250"," employment numbers was they dumped it anyways. "
"746490","749050"," So this is before the opening bell today."
"749270","750290"," So we might get a..."
"750290","753130"," Even if we get good numbers, it might still dip down and then we'll trade it out."
"753550","754970"," We'll take a look at the charts right now as well. "
"755230","756310"," And we'll read through the spot cam report."
"758030","759290"," We're going to talk about that stuff right now."
"760230","761630"," So I've got this..."
"762090","763830"," You guys can just put this on your chart if you want. "
"764150","765850"," We're at 457 to 62."
"766650","768230"," You remember that this was the previous high."
"768610","770370"," You could even go as high as 4812, right?"
"770870","772510"," We had a little pin strike up above here. "
"774150","777750"," 45812 or 45766 is where I put it at yesterday."
"779470","784650"," And then the target above of course is 4646006."
"784650","791490"," And then I did a retracement and above it's somewhere around 46, 4.50. If we get something that's"
"791490","797510"," crazy, crazy like inflation's going away, which we know it hasn't, we would trade up higher and"
"797510","799030"," this will be the price target above. "
"800050","805090"," If we get a CPI that is flat, right?"
"805370","806350"," It just meets expectations."
"807550","812610"," I am going to expect that we could possibly trade up higher briefly and then trade down here and"
"812610","813730"," try to find some support."
"813730","817470"," I know that you're going to want the bulls and the bulls are going to want to grab this. "
"818230","819710"," They're not going to want to grab this up here."
"819790","822670"," They're going to order to grab it lower to push this higher."
"823030","826810"," And you could see even yesterday in this melt up, there wasn't a lot of participation. "
"827310","830450"," This move yesterday, bulls are like, oh, hell no, I'm not buying this."
"830590","833590"," I'm going to wait for it to come down so I can grab it to take long again."
"833830","837910"," I would expect the same thing today that will encounter some kind of sideways action. "
"838670","842150"," Let's call it from 47, maybe even 460."
"842890","845190"," You can even go higher if you make this 460 here."
"846410","847510"," We'll switch this one lower. "
"849010","850350"," Let's see if it's sideways, right?"
"850630","852950"," So they had decent report, but not mind blowing."
"854170","854870"," Nothing crazy."
"855510","855930"," I'll give you 460. "
"857750","858150"," Okay."
"858730","862070"," And then you're going to trade between, but I still think if you tag up here, you're going to still"
"862070","868170"," trade down, consolidate over at least one, two, three days for the next leg higher."
"868770","870810"," If we even get that for OPEC. "
"871050","873910"," You might even just park it up here at some point, consolidate down."
"874770","878510"," We'll look for dips below, grab it and go higher."
"879030","886310"," Maybe we trade back to like 4.55 into OPEC, but I think the CPI report is going to matter"
"887210","888290"," where we trade in OPEC. "
"888850","891570"," Now, we'll read the spot again report this morning."
"891570","893870"," Futures are flat ahead of the API report."
"894630","900410"," Volatility forecast declined sharply to 0.67. That means we have compression of volatility, right?"
"900810","906690"," That means that we're going to tend to trade sideways unless we have a newsmaking event, right,"
"906770","907530"," expect sideways. "
"908670","915970"," Once standard deviation move, open the close versus 1.2% yesterday, you see large support at 42.50."
"916430","921410"," So remember that we were talking about that number all week long with resistance remaining at 4600,"
"921970","926630"," 4620, or maybe possibly 4620."
"927410","928870"," Spy equivalent is 460."
"929850","931850"," So just another day of us checking the flow, right?"
"932410","935690"," Watching to see if we get expansioning calls much higher so we can trade higher. "
"936950","941410"," Everybody's buying calls that are short dated and the money still puts a losing value across the"
"941410","941730"," market."
"942590","950210"," While many traders are watching this data point close, we feel that it won't have to be able to do"
"950210","950210"," that."
"950230","952410"," I agree with that because they're still adding hedges on. "
"952790","954070"," They keep saying they keep hearing up there."
"954330","954690"," It's funny."
"954790","956810"," Spark images did something where it's not retail. "
"957470","958730"," So retail is not buying."
"959150","963590"," I know there's a huge movement out there saying retail is buying puts way down at the bottom at"
"963590","963870"," 420."
"964450","966750"," They did not buy puts. "
"966970","969810"," As a matter of fact, Spark can put a report about that out earlier in the week."
"969930","971230"," Nobody's paying attention to that report."
"972790","976270"," But what is happening is people are buying put as we move up. "
"976990","978550"," So that is an issue, right?"
"978550","980490"," That's why we're not going to print those numbers down below."
"980830","983770"," And we have more rolling of puts out to farther dates."
"984690","986470"," We have it on flow agal every day. "
"986470","987770"," We can actually see them."
"988370","989370"," So they are still hedging."
"989450","991250"," The banks are still hedging all the way up right now. "
"991670","992850"," Whether you believe that or not."
"993250","1000330"," I don't know if this is coming from maybe hedge funds or small banks that want you to take the"
"1000330","1000810"," market long."
"1001170","1003050"," It's trying to convince you to take the market long. "
"1003790","1004390"," That's fine."
"1004710","1005470"," But they try to do that."
"1005570","1007150"," They push that narrative out there for you. "
"1008470","1012770"," For me and how I trade, I'm going to have protection on all the way up until we get some"
"1012770","1013590"," more positive news."
"1014210","1017910"," Like the CPI, if we trade up and we smash up, we start seeing call expansion."
"1018890","1021150"," Because we've been melting up, we haven't been venting up. "
"1021330","1021710"," We've been melting."
"1022090","1024210"," We've had part of the vanity, but not all the vanity."
"1024569","1026930"," We haven't had the expansion in calls to go along with it. "
"1027130","1029150"," We've had some calls, but not like usual."
"1029790","1032910"," We have liquidity in the market, but not quite usual."
"1033829","1039230"," It's more like cautious bullishness is still the order right now in the market. "
"1039829","1040910"," Still awaiting on news."
"1041410","1044869"," Still people are scared, including the banks and hedge funds, even if they're fucking telling you"
"1044869","1046730"," something different out there in the market."
"1047550","1052410"," While many traders are just watching this data point closely, we feel that it won't have much short "
"1052410","1054710","-term impact through the change in options, hedging positions. "
"1055390","1060570"," We start clearing clear increase in gamma at the 4600 strike yesterday, which we think further"
"1060570","1063590"," boxes in today's price action yesterday's chart."
"1063970","1069570"," We'll take a major data surprise to dislodge the markets from this 4520 to 4600 area."
"1069970","1072030"," That reinforces the sideways trade, right?"
"1072310","1074090"," No matter what you're hearing out on Twitter, right?"
"1074590","1078310"," I'm telling you, there's a shit ton of puts out there still, right?"
"1078430","1082510"," They're rolling these puts out there and none of these bulls are taking outside the money calls. "
"1082770","1083290"," They're just not."
"1084110","1087950"," So you're going to have to see news driven for us to drive higher at this point."
"1089410","1090850"," And that doesn't mean that people aren't accumulating. "
"1091110","1092290"," People are accumulating positions."
"1092650","1093590"," People are buying the bottoms."
"1093910","1098490"," But also remember, too, that bulls are buying at 420 and we're now at almost 460, right?"
"1099050","1104330"," So why put risk on the table when you've gone up 400 points or 40 points, but however you count?"
"1105830","1108250"," I think that's it for right now on Spock M."
"1108430","1109030"," I don't know if there's much. "
"1109230","1110270"," I can leave this here for you guys."
"1110570","1113010"," You guys can see key support and resistance strikes."
"1113210","1115950"," You can come back to this because I'm going to cut this short at some point. "
"1115950","1121890"," You can pause this or use this video after the CPI release."
"1125250","1129530"," And you can set these up on your own charts and pause this video."
"1129670","1130510"," Come back to it if you like. "
"1131270","1132070"," Whatever you need to do."
"1133570","1135190"," I'll scroll this for you so you can see it."
"1136430","1138990"," And then I'm going to move over to ES real quick. "
"1139870","1140770"," I don't know what I just did there."
"1140890","1141570"," I just turned stuff on."
"1142090","1143930"," I don't know what I just turned on. "
"1144190","1145210"," Click the wrong thing."
"1145210","1145650"," Okay."
"1146090","1149990"," So I want to show you some of the setups for today. "
"1150470","1150630"," Okay."
"1150750","1156490"," And even now this doesn't matter what happens today for CPI rates."
"1156630","1160330"," So CPI is, you know, super crazy inflation's gone. "
"1160850","1162130"," You're going to see a move up here, right?"
"1163210","1164610"," More than like it's going to get really high."
"1168050","1169330"," If we can get closer."
"1170090","1170730"," It's pretty much closer. "
"1170730","1171330"," Move that."
"1171610","1171830"," What?"
"1172310","1173030"," 12 minutes left."
"1175530","1177070"," Maybe we can get into a month. "
"1179470","1180550"," Turn this off here."
"1182710","1183270"," Dang it."
"1184210","1184990"," Hold on here. "
"1187070","1187910"," Put this closer."
"1191870","1196110"," And, you know, if we get this CPI report that comes in super under, we're super bullish."
"1196350","1197090"," Everything's crazy, right?"
"1197810","1199890"," You might see a dip below, right?"
"1200070","1201990"," We dip below and then we rocket ship here. "
"1201990","1203430"," Maybe here and then straight up."
"1203550","1203770"," Okay."
"1204290","1205670"," I want you to see that right there. "
"1205770","1205870"," Okay."
"1206090","1207210"," Bam, bam, bam, bam."
"1207250","1208310"," And we make a move higher. "
"1209110","1209930"," New trading range."
"1210550","1211050"," Everybody's happy."
"1212750","1213530"," Super bullish. "
"1217170","1220830"," If we have something that's sideways, we start trading sideways today."
"1221690","1222610"," Or if we have a normal day."
"1223170","1225110"," I wouldn't say we don't trade up to 460. "
"1226010","1228910"," And then we're going to start to trade down and consolidate in here."
"1229030","1229170"," Okay."
"1229990","1230870"," For a couple days. "
"1231310","1236350"," Now, the key in, if we consolidate in this area here, is always remember that, let's say, let's say"
"1236350","1237930"," we're consolidating just inside of here."
"1238470","1243470"," Remember that you're going to be patient that we might have to be patient and wait to grab a moment"
"1243470","1246930"," where we trade below wherever the range is going to be, right?"
"1247070","1248730"," That 45, 45, 20."
"1249110","1250350"," You got 45, 20 here. "
"1250930","1251350"," You could end up."
"1251670","1255730"," If the range is 4600 to 45, 20, let's say we're trading in here."
"1255890","1258410"," And then for a brief moment, we dip down and you're a bull. "
"1258510","1259270"," You want to grab that."
"1259270","1259550"," Okay."
"1259770","1260330"," If we're flat. "
"1261770","1262350"," Same thing."
"1262450","1266350"," If we're, if we have a flat, if we have a flat report and we start trading somewhere in here"
"1266350","1271510"," and we move up her minute in your bear, you want to grab your shorts above our consolidation range."
"1271510","1271870"," Okay. "
"1272270","1277390"," Then we grab them above and outside of our consolidation range and below our consolidation range."
"1278710","1281050"," So be patient if we get a flat report."
"1281530","1281990"," That's the key. "
"1282130","1285270"," If we get a flat report, just be patient to grab lungs and shorts."
"1285270","1290370"," That might take a day for us to even take a trade if we get a flat report."
"1291090","1291330"," Okay. "
"1291330","1295710"," So if we're boxed in here, there's your up here, grabbing shorts and bulls are waiting."
"1296150","1300030"," This could take you a half a day to grab something to take long above here."
"1300390","1301990"," If we get a really shitty report, right?"
"1302430","1303130"," Really bad report. "
"1303450","1307710"," We might, we might actually come up here and we're going to, we're going to start trading down,"
"1307710","1308010"," right?"
"1309390","1310910"," You're going to see something like this."
"1311390","1312890"," You'll see something like this, right?"
"1312890","1313630"," It'll get all heated."
"1314130","1316070"," And then we're going to start making our way down, right?"
"1316350","1317290"," Something just like that. "
"1317430","1317750"," You'll see."
"1318230","1318590"," Okay."
"1319670","1323790"," And if we, if we get a battery port, let's say that, I shouldn't even say the battery port probably"
"1323790","1324890"," send us straight down, right?"
"1325050","1327470"," You come up again and then start trading down. "
"1327670","1334470"," But if we get a battery port, we'll pay attention to how it's trading down and look to see if"
"1334470","1340350"," it's going to, if it's going to actually start crashing bad or if it's just going to be an impulse"
"1340350","1346150"," wave down to 4520 and then it'll start consolidating again."
"1346570","1350410"," We can, you can just watch how the charts move during the day."
"1350470","1353570"," We've done this before, I think, I think it was in the minutes or some we've talked about this in"
"1353570","1359650"," the past, how it'll look for trade setups and how to identify when we're going to trade down gently"
"1359650","1362150"," or start to dump heavily, right?"
"1362370","1365670"," Cause you'll see it start to dribble in and then it'll start firing down and all cylinders. "
"1366190","1371350"," So it's, the good thing today is that this report is prior to the open."
"1371610","1376790"," So I don't know if you're long or short right now, what you're going to be doing."
"1376790","1381510"," But the key for you today, if you're long or short is to pay attention to these numbers before they"
"1381510","1386510"," open because they're going to be telling as to where we trade for the next, you know, it could be"
"1386510","1392510"," the next week or it could be even deeper into open, not the end to OPEX. "
"1393170","1394230"," And today is the 10th."
"1394230","1396450"," So we've got, you know, what is it, eight to eight days left?"
"1397590","1402350"," We got two and then five more trading days left, it was two, I don't think at this right or"
"1402350","1406370"," not, but two, two and five more days left of trading."
"1407190","1411110"," So we're set up here for any, any report that they hand to us this morning. "
"1414230","1415070"," Good morning, everybody."
"1415330","1415810"," How's everybody doing?"
"1416470","1416990"," All right."
"1417010","1417970"," So I've got that for you there. "
"1418170","1426920"," I'm going to turn on the, I'm going to turn on the little equity news from."
"1426920","1432160"," You're listening to trade the news so that we can hear the CPI report as it comes in."
"1432260","1434400"," Get yourself a piece of paper and pen, right?"
"1434940","1440720"," You know that the expected, the expected is 7.2, just write down like 7.2 on a piece of"
"1440720","1441960"," paper so you can do this for yourself. "
"1442540","1444640"," This is a channel that's trying to teach you guys how to trade, right?"
"1446240","1447840"," So I'm going to turn this off here."
"1448700","1453360"," Just a channel tries to teach you guys how to learn how to trade and how to work on like"
"1453360","1454720"," the economic calendar, right?"
"1454980","1456460"," What you're looking for in the economic calendar."
"1457540","1459460"," So we're going to, let's see here. "
"1460280","1460820"," Hold on."
"1462460","1465980"," What you do this morning is just grab yourself a piece of paper and pen to open up a note"
"1465980","1467380"," pad on your computer, whatever you need to do."
"1468000","1475980"," You're just going to write down a 70 yearly CPI is the expectation of 7.2 and then 0.4"
"1475980","1478820"," is your month to month. "
"1479780","1485060"," The month to month is actually January's report, not February's."
"1487340","1492960"," And then you're looking for, if we're just right in line, right, within a point or two on both of"
"1492960","1495520"," those numbers, you're going to, we're going to probably trade sideways."
"1496000","1497400"," We might hit for 16 trade sideways. "
"1498460","1501600"," If it's going to be messy, we're going to be looking for something above, right?"
"1502180","1505680"," So we've got 7.2. We're looking for a much higher number, right?"
"1505920","1507520"," A couple points higher, not like 8 or 9."
"1507520","1514360"," Markets are coming off of highs out of the January U.S. CPI data, CPI month for month expected 0 "
"1514360","1523520",".4%, ex-food boundary seen 0.5%, you're expected 7.2% and 5.9% at the weekly initial"
"1523520","1523760"," job."
"1523900","1530680"," Let's claim to expect 230,000 primaries, 238,000, continuing claims expected 1.6, 2,000,000"
"1530680","1530740"," million."
"1532260","1533360"," Yes, here, not this morning. "
"1537760","1538980"," Yes, everybody's waiting right now."
"1539020","1541060"," We've got five more minutes left until those numbers come out."
"1541880","1553920"," We're going to come back here, give"
"1553920","1554900"," me just a second here. "
"1565550","1566650"," All right, hold on."
"1582070","1588990"," And if we can't trade the indexes, they may be we'll trade Roblox, right?"
"1588990","1595410"," Everybody knows that Nancy Pelosi is all balls deep inside of Roblox, right, for their earnings."
"1596690","1606560"," So we will, if we might trade Roblox today, if we can, up or 10, four minutes"
"1606560","1610940"," until the numbers are released. "
"1624000","1629240"," Tyson, curb, TK, after their earnings report, the CFO saying when asked about the automotive"
"1629240","1634480"," market, they see Q1 as the trough, Tango Kilo Alpha trading in Germany."
"1635280","1637760"," So we're not saying, so I'm not saying that it's good."
"1638380","1644700"," So if you just tuned in earlier, I talked about what they're going to attempt to do in the market. "
"1645220","1650360"," When I say good, I mean, if the numbers come in lower, you better expect this market to trade up."
"1650940","1655780"," Just be careful with the words that you use when it comes to trading or investing."
"1656840","1664910"," We're moving the main street hat away from the trader hat, main street hat, you know, of course, if"
"1664910","1669170"," you ask me, I don't want to see, you know, I don't like the fraud that's going on in our"
"1669170","1669430"," government. "
"1669750","1674790"," I like the fraud that's going on with the Fed, you know, it's a complete different argument versus"
"1674790","1678330"," what's going on in global factors continue to drive supply chain issues."
"1679830","1683910"," So just be careful with, you know, it's good or it's bad or whatever, you need to know if it's"
"1683910","1687650"," good for the market to be going up or it's bad that the market's going to go down."
"1690030","1692070"," That's all that matters at the end of the day, right?"
"1692270","1693750"," Especially for positioning in this market. "
"1693910","1697230"," If you want to take a short, you want to see those numbers nice and high."
"1697470","1701350"," I don't think you're going to see the market sell off if they put the fraud in."
"1701450","1705210"," You might see a quick dip, but I don't think you're going to see the market sell if they're way"
"1705210","1705910"," out of line, right?"
"1706170","1710070"," We're down to like four or five percent or something stupid like that and kind of bullshit like"
"1710070","1710330"," that. "
"1710330","1712170"," You're going to see the market rip higher guaranteed."
"1718320","1723240"," Yeah, this is this says this has nothing to do with what I think this has only to do with"
"1723240","1724620"," what the how the numbers are released."
"1726400","1727000"," It's irrelevant. "
"1727320","1731600"," It's all about the money that's in our pockets has nothing to do with what I think or what I"
"1731600","1733100"," what I wish and what I hope for."
"1742030","1748850"," A 90 second cent to our data January CPI month or 90 seconds, 0.4 percent core expected 0.5"

"1763830","1766930"," You can get to see what the reaction is going to be if they're going to leak the numbers."
"1770460","1774460"," Trust me, I'm disgusted right now with with make my main street hat."
"1774900","1780080"," I'm disgusted, but as my trader have my investor hat, you have to trade what's in front of you"
"1780080","1781720"," because at the end of the day, it's your money. "
"1781940","1783160"," No bank cares about your money."
"1783660","1785840"," Now, nobody cares about your money, but you, right?"
"1787360","1791540"," You can't just like feed the I'm going to short the market if they're they're committing fraud."
"1792120","1795820"," You have to trade with them at all times or step outside and be cash. "
"1797220","1802460"," Because it's because it happens as a cloud's judgment in in where the market's going to go."
"1803040","1804700"," So my hope is that I lost the data."
"1807470","1808150"," Here we go. "

"2023590","2026430"," Looks like let's see if we get closer here. "
"2026990","2033510"," We've got the level down below at 430 right and we want to look at that 4520 and see if"

"2058449","2062449"," Yeah I like to I actually want to see lingo I want to see the I do want to see"
"2062449","2064469"," the 10 year go above 2 percent. "

"2106270","2112570"," So the four rate hikes by the middle part of the summer currently the futures market."

"2132250","2134170"," I think it's 0.25 basis point. "
"2135390","2146440"," So we should see if you're a bull you want to see a rejection above at"
"2146440","2146820"," this rate."

"2176790","2186470"," I want to see this area of"
"2186470","2187530"," resistance right here. "
"2188130","2196050"," So you don't want to see the 10 year go above 2.016 big time no no."
"2197030","2205410"," You could possibly go as high as 2.135 before we sell the market."
"2206170","2215030"," You are looking for a rejection at some point off of 2.016 2.135 at some point here in"
"2215030","2224070"," the next couple weeks and it is concerning that we have not priced in those five increases. "
"2224070","2226410"," We'll see if the board holds a 45-20."
"2226910","2232230"," If you are bull you're going to be looking for a consolidation over the next few days and you might"
"2232230","2237010"," see some weakness at some point you want to grab yourself along there and trade within the"
"2237010","2237950"," consolidation zone."
"2238450","2244150"," If you're a bear you want to be waiting to take shorts until we trade higher in that consolidation"
"2244150","2247350"," phase to for trade down. "

"2263770","2271120"," I'll be looking for entries on both sides of that trade Yeah, I've got a demo put spread down of"
"2271120","2278580"," 40 442 and 440 But I don't think we get that low maybe I mean it's possible you can see"
"2278580","2284880"," now we have new support building down here at 440 This wasn't here before we'll take a look at This"
"2284880","2288660"," was at 430 before we didn't have this this level of support."
"2289100","2291280"," So if we trade down to 440, I'm going to take profit, right?"
"2292160","2293380"," This wasn't here earlier. "
"2294060","2296600"," This big support down here is at 430."

"7607070","7614390"," either a dribble sideways Because that means we're going to keep dropping Territory now we're"
"7614390","7619730"," covering all the early losses has to be down less than two tenths one percent And we had a reaction"
