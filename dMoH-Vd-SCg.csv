"3110","4650"," We got going on here."
"5170","10290"," This leader is provided to permit the projectionist to complete adjustment of focus and sound level"
"10290","12050"," before the film begins."
"26350","27350"," Alright, here we go. "
"30750","39150"," Take the money and run."
"70870","79440"," Let's get this"
"79440","86860"," started here to be an interesting day here, we're going to get right into it."
"97420","103380"," Okay, so right away, I want to tell you guys something, I'm going to mute this CMBC here in the"
"103380","103700"," background. "
"106020","114040"," Alright, so just quickly, okay, so this is our three right here, so I need to be aware of this"
"114040","115040"," right on the opening bell."
"115600","120760"," This is pretty much normally the top, okay, and we're opening on that part."
"120820","124660"," Two minutes, Tom, now at 9.45 AM Eastern time, do you see this?"
"126420","129500"," So we are at our three right on the open this morning. "
"129720","133380"," We can trade higher now."
"133380","143360"," Now, the cell is right here in between 4 and 8,"
"143580","153480"," 31 and 4, 89, 38 or 39, anyway, it's somewhere in here, okay, so this is a"
"153480","156100"," normal like big time cell signal right here, okay."
"157820","167220"," We, very, we're talking like 2% of the time, will we trade above here today, okay, so just be"
"167220","169580"," careful of, take the money and run. "
"170100","179640"," Now, I'm saying that to you also because the next level above this is extremely high, it's like"
"179640","187980"," way, way, way up here, so it's not that we can't go up here,"
"188460","193360"," but it's extremely, it's pretty high up, okay."
"194300","198780"," So you're talking about just look at this here, so do I think you can squeeze up here today?"
"199620","207680"," Probably not to 500, okay, but you can later on in the week stuff like that if we get a"
"207680","213140"," good, more good tech report, stuff like that, just be aware that where we are right now this"
"213140","221900"," morning, we're likely going to sell right where we are, and even if we come up, sometimes we'll"
"221900","227860"," oftentimes like do a quick back check, spam straight up and tag this upper range in here, that is"
"227860","230960"," possible today, but I wouldn't be expecting more than that."
"231040","237580"," So we're pretty close to, I take the money and run kind of a situation, depending on how much risk"
"237580","238100"," you want to put up. "
"238100","243000"," If you were holding zero dates overnight, this is the place for you to take the money and run, even"
"243000","246960"," if we come up here and retest this in regular cash market and then begin to roll down, even if"
"246960","251860"," we squeeze up here, if you were long overnight, remember yesterday when we were closing the stream"
"251860","260920"," down after the reports, I said, do you to expect the narrative to be extremely bullish for the rest"
"260920","263680"," of these companies that are going to be reporting?"
"264440","265640"," Why is that not on?"
"265780","270660"," Hold on a second here, are we not switching between these two, something's going on here."
"272520","280740"," Anyway, at any rate, my point here is that when we have a bad Netflix report,"
"281260","289460"," we were joking yesterday about CNBC will come out and get negative, you'll see negativity around"
"289460","297580"," the market where it will impact other tech stocks, others' tech stocks will sell off and bleed and"
"297580","298440"," all that kind of stuff."
"299240","302800"," And as we were closing the stream yesterday, I said to you, don't expect that, right?"
"302880","308100"," You're going to expect positivity in the market based upon Netflix's report. "
"308780","313620"," Now saying that, right, all of that can go out the window on the next report."
"314000","319140"," There are many years where we'll get a Netflix report or many quarters where we'll get a bad net,"
"319140","324820"," not many, but we'll get a bad Netflix report, let's say, right, and then we have following reports"
"324820","325700"," that are positive."
"326540","330180"," So keep that in mind just in the rest of the reports in the week. "
"330700","336360"," This effect is wonderful, it's being monetized today, so just be aware of it."
"336460","341140"," I'm still bullish on the week, I'm bullish here, all that kind of stuff for the rest of this week,"
"341180","347140"," but I want you to still understand that there are pullbacks along the way."
"349180","353560"," And all it takes is one or two battery ports for this glow to go away. "
"353840","357620"," So just be aware of that as the week progresses and the inverse holds true as well."
"357740","362300"," You can see like bearishness in the market if Netflix had had a bad report like in previous"
"362300","366880"," quarters, but then all of a sudden we get great reports from other companies and they make the"
"366880","368680"," market perk up to the upside."
"368860","371000"," So just that inverse correlation there. "
"372600","373820"," Now, so I'd be taking the money."
"373820","380760"," It was me personally, if you were holding overnight on that bullish thesis and glow for the"
"380760","384000"," markets, this is a place to take money and look for a dip to buy."
"384900","389620"," We know those dips are down below here in the hourly trigger and the half an hour trigger to the"
"389620","390080"," downsides. "
"390080","395600"," So if you're looking for a dip to buy, if you missed the close yesterday, if you missed the ramp"
"395600","401300"," up in the four to four 15 hour, if you missed all this overnight stuff, your dip by is lower,"
"401800","411780"," at least at a 484 91, and then we're also going to look at the four PM close and"
"411780","418220"," that was at just above this, it's right where the hourly trigger is."
"418520","420020"," So I'll put that on here as well."
"422800","424080"," Check this really quick. "
"424240","429640"," Hold on one second here, right about there."
"430920","437020"," And this is the four PM, normally this stuff gets erased too in the overnight, you'll wake up and"
"437020","445020"," the SPX or Qs will be where they were now that they did hold this until the open, which is"
"445020","446000"," phenomenal."
"447660","449440"," Not normal to see this, right?"
"449440","458440"," So this is the closing price, this is the six PM or four PM, I remember I have that wrong,"
"458600","468650"," four PM closing in one"
"468650","476350"," quick second here, nice and small down there, make sure I got this right here, 1600 right about"
"476350","478110"," right about somewhere in here. "
"478270","480670"," I'm not going to look for the exact, it's somewhere right here."
"481370","484230"," Just keep your eye on that closing price if they do pull it back."
"484230","488590"," This is where the hourly trigger is, would not be shocked to see all of this come back at some"
"488590","488890"," point. "
"489590","494550"," Even if we get a bounce down here and squeeze up there and tag that STXL and come back down"
"494550","499590"," here and that would be your dip buy down here somewhere along where this hourly trigger is."
"499830","505690"," So if you're looking for a dip buy down here somewhere around 485, which I got that right right"
"505690","509870"," now, and we also want to be looking at the SPX gamma."
"511110","514510"," So I want to draw your attention to this chart down below here, okay?"
"515210","516750"," You've got this SPX gamma. "
"516909","523450"," We talked about this yesterday when trader podcast was on, I had said I'd love to see 4900 this"
"523450","524030"," week, right?"
"524650","531530"," And we have 4900 already, so we tagged this 4900 and what would we tag it from the moment we"
"531530","537070"," had the conversation yesterday at one o'clock in the afternoon at four by four fifteen, right?"
"537070","538230"," And we'll enter the open today."
"539250","546610"," So just be aware that we are tagging this 4900 and when I was showing you that the chart up"
"546610","553550"," here, when I was showing you the next move for us after this band of resistance above here, this is"
"553550","559950"," that 85 million gamma wall at 4900 and when I said to you, yeah, the next one is way up"
"559950","566730"," here right at that 5,000, we'll take a look at gamma and see if that's true here too and"
"566730","567330"," it is, right?"
"567930","573630"," So if you look down this chart down below here, you can see that the jump from this 85 million"
"574070","575510"," is straight up here."
"575570","578130"," There's just a big giant gap right here, okay?"
"578870","584530"," Now I have not downloaded the gamma levels this morning yet, I'd like to take them later in the"
"584530","592050"," morning so I'm going to add those right now and we'll see, we'll check and see how much change"
"592050","594650"," there is in gamma levels this morning. "
"594870","601010"," So on your bottom left-hand side of your chart, we're going to take a quick look here and see"
"601010","608410"," what the gamma profile or picture looks like right there and see if anything has changed and it"
"608410","608710"," has."
"609090","611810"," So we do have some changes in gamma this morning."
"612810","619630"," So let's take a look at that, we still have that 4900 here, 160 million and now we can start"
"619630","626730"," to see some levels above start to develop between that 5,000 and let's take a look, we've got that"
"626730","636610"," 5,000 above there, 107 million up here and 93 million at 90, 4950 and then 43 million at,"
"636730","642470"," this is a weak wall right here at 4925 but still a kind of a major wall up here now,"
"642570","646970"," this is even a bigger wall than it was yesterday at that 4900. "
"646970","654010"," So I'd be really, we're really wary of this right now and I'd be looking for a dip buy down"
"654010","660910"," at 4875, you see this where my cursor is down here, 4875, I just want to show you this right"
"660910","668510"," here, right down here, this four, right down here, right at 4875 down here, okay."
"669670","675930"," And I bet you that's pretty close to the, I'm not betting guarantee but I'm going to bet that,"
"675930","685670"," that, that, wait a minute, I'm going to show this 4875, I'm going to bet that that somewhere"
"685670","691470"," falls into this half hour trigger, somewhere somewhere right in here is going to be where that is"
"691470","692210"," right there, okay."
"696100","699340"," So I'm going to, I'm going to post a, I'm going to do this right, I'm going to do it"
"699340","699760"," like this. "
"700500","708620"," On the bottom chart, I'm going to draw out a buy the dipbox down here, okay, and move this down"
"708620","708820"," here."
"712760","714480"," We'll take, we'll make this one green."
"717140","727140"," We're going to make this one here a, either a cell or a, if we can park"
"727140","728200"," it up here, it'd be even better. "
"729880","737280"," But a yellow box up here at that 4900 and then if we can get above that 4900, we'll begin"
"737280","749660"," to talk about going to four, 4925 and real truly 4950, turning that"
"749660","756860"," box into a, turning this yellow box into a green box, we have to get price above it though but"
"756860","757720"," we're not there right now."
"757900","764040"," So right in here, I'm going to draw what I think is going to happen here."
"764260","768820"," So on this chart up here, if we can maintain this for just a minute. "
"769480","771300"," See if we can catch some of this FOMO."
"771560","773500"," Now we do have a bear cross right now already."
"777950","780190"," This is the most likely path here. "
"781630","785550"," Maybe, maybe one more squeeze up here and then bam, straight down here."
"789570","791390"," It's possible you can get one more squeeze out of this."
"791850","794590"," Get some FOMO buyers in in the first thing in the morning sometimes. "
"795370","796370"," Right in there, it's possible."
"799010","801030"," Then be looking for a dip buy down here."
"804160","805520"," Attach some of that FOMO over there. "
"806120","809780"," Now there is another secondary path where of course would be with this, this is a bear cross right"
"809780","810020"," here."
"811040","813740"," Now we would just straight, straight come straight down here."
"814940","816160"," Then do some consolidating. "
"820370","822270"," Looks like almost like a sideways day."
"825410","827750"," Make that one green, make you guys happy and stuff."
"829370","837550"," Remember that if we are, if we do trade above, if we take this trade right here, if we take"
"837550","844070"," this trade right here, you still need to see a path that's like the, actually get rid of that path. "
"845070","862280"," You'd want to see something like this here, but you"
"862280","866080"," wouldn't want to take this trade unless this part of the trade already took place."
"867080","873500"," You'd take the trade, this is a bad color dude, this color sucks right there."
"877380","884440"," You'd want to see price first come above right up here. "
"885080","891560"," And then you'd take the trade on the one minute trigger long to trade up into that 490 or whatever."
"891800","897840"," So don't take that trade unless you see a squeeze above and a successful retest of this previous,"
"897840","899180"," previous eye from pre-market."
"900080","903580"," And I'd actually be jumping on it somewhere in there, somewhere in there we jump on that trade. "
"908920","912720"," Otherwise if you're a bull and you've missed all of this stuff and you're looking to jump on it"
"912720","913400"," down below here."
"920430","922350"," One quick second, I'll line this up for you."
"925280","930440"," Yeah, the trade to the upside is, the trade to the upside would be, you should be monetizing the"
"930440","931620"," overnight trade right now. "
"932160","936460"," If you want to jump back in, you want to first see price come up, you don't take this part"
"936460","941340"," of the trade, it'll reverse and just confirm the leg is higher."
"941840","946840"," And then you would see the one minute reverse to the upside right here and you'd be Johnny on the"
"946840","947920"," spot with a stop below."
"948880","954060"," Looking for this, this part of the trade right there with stops underneath. "
"955540","958420"," Stops would actually be below whatever that is right there, be down here somewhere."
"968940","969900"," Down there."
"976340","978080"," Morning everybody, how's everybody doing out there?"
"978800","980060"," Let me give you an update really quick too. "
"980260","990200"," So I'm spending nights with the developers until like last night I was awake until I had the"
"990200","994480"," stream up yesterday morning right nine thirty so I'm awake at seven thirty in the morning six"
"994480","995760"," thirty in the morning shit like that."
"996420","1003480"," And then last two or three nights I've been awake with developers till one thirty in the morning."
"1004320","1010620"," I'm catching like four and a half hours of sleep a night and then trying to wrap up this launch"
"1010620","1014800"," for you guys and for us and for me, for you and everybody else out there. "
"1014800","1022680"," So we're getting really close super close and it's a matter of like small detail stuff."
"1023260","1029359"," And then rebuilding the discord that kind of stuff some background work and then finalizing."
"1030960","1036960"," Turnies finalizing agreements with with partners and stuff and then finalizing agreements with"
"1036960","1042660"," mostly developers like developers when they're if you guys don't know anything about development"
"1042660","1042900"," hell. "
"1043619","1047180"," When you come down to a crunch deadline like a project is wrapping up."
"1048040","1055300"," You have to like test everything so and then make changes along the way so an example would be."
"1056060","1065300"," We ran some memberships the other day Joe Joe Joe and I did late night and we're looking we're"
"1065300","1069940"," going every step of the way for instructions for someone signing up and then if they. "
"1069940","1076000"," If not they fail but if like if we like try we try to like break the process."
"1077700","1081220"," So if there was a break what would happen how do we fix it that kind of stuff."
"1081640","1088420"," And then we have web hooks and all this other stuff to like grant you to see this and let"
"1088420","1090020"," you see that and all this other shit. "
"1090280","1096140"," So usually if I don't know if some of you I think have engineering backgrounds but any of you that"
"1096140","1098620"," do not have engineering backgrounds."
"1098620","1103060"," The last like leg is a is a pain in the ass."
"1103680","1105740"," It really is it's it's like that. "
"1106000","1109200"," If you ever like try to complete something that's been difficult."
"1109900","1114800"," You ever notice that last mile is always a dash to the end right."
"1117380","1121680"," Pure not pure pandemonium but you know it's like we're missing now we're missing this. "
"1121800","1125520"," How do we miss this what we have to wait and even think about that all that kind of stuff"
"1125520","1125780"," so."
"1125780","1134320"," So I'm assuming here from now into I'm hoping it's not going to last into the end of the month."
"1134460","1137900"," The plan is to launch on the 31st or 1st. "
"1138980","1144480"," And but I assume at this point that I won't be sleeping for the next at least four or five"
"1144480","1146680"," days maybe six days or something like that."
"1147320","1152580"," Trying to be ready for this stuff so we're not we're not content we've been this like."
"1153600","1156960"," Hey we're going to launch no we're not launching here we're going to launch no we're not launching"
"1156960","1157600"," here we're going to launch. "
"1157720","1160140"," We don't like what the devs did that kind of stuff."
"1160740","1165840"," And so now that the rains have been taken over by our lead developer and he's just a hip deep"
"1165840","1167000"," in this shit trying to get it done."
"1170340","1174460"," Yeah so rocket surgeon just said it's like building a house you can frame it in a week but it"
"1174460","1176100"," takes three months to finish the trim work. "
"1176300","1180760"," It's exactly like that rocket surgeons that's a great way to describe it."
"1187200","1191860"," Also I can I can get in to try the trigger from the ground up doing whatever needs to be"
"1191860","1192520"," done on the side."
"1192520","1193940"," Oh, hell yeah green man. "
"1196440","1198500"," Yeah so here's the deal so."
"1199420","1200340"," We had a."
"1201840","1208160"," So why are we here right now is a big question we are here right now because."
"1209540","1219240"," We were told that we were told that we could launch this in a format that"
"1219240","1226120"," would not cost us stupid money for for the data. "
"1227020","1230920"," We went down this long process and found out that we were wrong."
"1230920","1236280"," And then we were told well it's going to cost you."
"1237020","1242260"," You know a bunch of money like I'm like serious money serious money development. "
"1242320","1249240"," And now we it's cost us the stupid money at that point but that the cost of like AWS and"
"1249240","1254020"," the cost of data from our Finviz and all these other places."
"1254020","1258680"," It's like 35 to $50,000 a month."
"1259560","1265840"," And the issue from my side is I've already incurred six figures of losses in the past couple of"
"1265840","1270200"," years with just running all of this where we are right now where I'd like six figures I think. "
"1271080","1277480"," And the the fear from my end at least is if I launch this or if I launched this and"
"1277480","1281260"," it's the form that we were going to launch in and it didn't catch."
"1282840","1285080"," If people didn't go for it."
"1285740","1286700"," I would start eating. "
"1288140","1294340"," Five figures every month until I shut it down so how long do you bleed like that."
"1295220","1298240"," Six months a year two years what is it so."
"1299060","1302520"," Went back to the drawing board and. "
"1304160","1307020"," Tried to find a solution that worked to where."
"1308120","1310680"," We can offer you tickers."
"1312280","1317900"," On a web based app with the with the with the with the tools and all that other kind of"
"1317900","1318620"," shit and then. "
"1320040","1322760"," Have it not be so cost prohibitive."
"1323040","1325000"," And so we went back to the drawing board."
"1325000","1330800"," Like go a bunch of developers whole team of them and then went right to Quinn if you don't know"
"1330800","1331640"," who he is he's a."
"1333040","1334840"," SpaceX x Apple x SpaceX. "
"1336480","1339760"," Staff engineer is now a staff engineer for another."
"1340260","1343440"," I don't know if you guys want to staff engineers but it's basically."
"1344620","1345640"," Like a director. "
"1346520","1348540"," If you take up when you get high up in a company."
"1349840","1353460"," As an engineer you can take a path in like administration."
"1355060","1359520"," Or you take a path as a as an engineer that's like a director. "
"1360300","1362280"," I don't know how to explain this well."
"1362620","1367140"," I'm trying to figure it out military terms but there really isn't a good way to describe it"
"1367140","1368000"," military terms."
"1368720","1373660"," It's like a it's like a general that's a doctor or something and they focus really on medicine and"
"1373660","1376280"," not on command authority of any kind. "
"1377320","1380020"," And so he's that right now he's a staff machine learning and."
"1380840","1382160"," Staff machine learning and."
"1383740","1386020"," And artificial intelligence engineer. "
"1386400","1388960"," It's a pretty big position it's not like hey is a member of the staff."
"1389260","1391660"," It's like a director for a big tech company."
"1392260","1395920"," So we had to have him step in to try to help us find a solution and it's taken a"
"1395920","1397420"," long time to find that solution. "
"1397800","1400840"," Now we found it and we're about to launch."
"1401460","1406480"," There will be a version of the tool for you not like me showing you a chart of it or"
"1406480","1408380"," doing a daily update for you."
"1408380","1412060"," Where you get to manipulate it and work on it and it's affordable it's cheap. "
"1412580","1420280"," I think our entry level is I think it's 25 don't hold me to this but I think it's 25"
"1420280","1420900"," a month."
"1422100","1424200"," If you sign up for the year it's 20 bucks a month."
"1425120","1429680"," You get to pick the tickers that you want to use you can use the full suite on our website. "
"1430760","1433080"," That also includes chatting on Twitch."
"1433760","1437900"," We're working on developing I think work is trying to work on some kind of development the"
"1437900","1438620"," background to."
"1439080","1441980"," So right now we pay five you pay five bucks to chat right. "
"1443020","1446660"," And we have to protect the discord this time so it's going to cost money so."
"1447160","1453020"," The idea here would be get the tool discord and the basic discord and."
"1453840","1456680"," The ability to chat for a grand total of 20 bucks. "
"1457700","1460340"," So what's costing us and."
"1461180","1463400"," We're not making any money at this fucking level."
"1464480","1466520"," But it should pay for. "
"1467300","1468440"," What we're doing."
"1469320","1473560"," So that was our original plan or that's plan but our original thesis was."
"1475720","1478140"," We want to see this continue on. "
"1479800","1481600"," And be able to take care of itself."
"1482160","1483040"," How do you do that?"
"1483040","1485240"," There has to be some kind of monetization."
"1486720","1489420"," But we don't want to charge people money so. "
"1490860","1496380"," No one charges $20 for the shit nobody I looked all over I checked every asshole out there at."
"1496860","1499460"," It's 20 bucks 25 20 bucks for the year."
"1500060","1503580"," What is that I think that's what 200 240 bucks for a year. "
"1504120","1506760"," There's people out there charging that per month right now."
"1507280","1511720"," So you get in on that now there's higher levels with more options."
"1511720","1515080"," Then there's like hey I want to take the tool away and use it on whatever I want. "
"1515600","1516340"," And walk away."
"1516580","1520300"," There's a professional discord as well."
"1521740","1525620"," That's between taken very seriously that costs more money. "
"1526300","1531060"," But we did meet our goal like we are actually we met our first goal for the first three years"
"1531060","1532040"," and now we're."
"1532200","1537580"," We're following through to completion on what we promise we would offer."
"1538320","1540580"," And our commitment to the retail trader. "
"1541160","1543920"," So all in all I'm fucking stoked."
"1544460","1547900"," Like I'm super stoked I sound tired and cranky but I'm not."
"1548360","1553180"," I'm super excited that we're able to follow through in our promises. "
"1553780","1557500"," And we're able to protect our discord protect our community."
"1558140","1562440"," All this other cool shit and actually pay for more development too."
"1563180","1567520"," So we got some really other we got some crazy cool shit coming down the road is. "
"1567520","1567760"," As well."
"1568540","1569980"," A bunch of gamma stuff."
"1570680","1576780"," We're in a negotiation right now with an earnings group. "
"1577560","1581180"," And we got some I can't talk about some of this stuff that's coming."
"1581680","1587060"," But we have more cool shit coming down the road that is going to be bad ass."
"1587960","1593080"," And personally I think it will be unrivaled to some extent once it once it comes to fruition. "
"1593080","1596920"," So think of us still in some kind of beta phase at this point but."
"1599200","1601480"," I'm excited I'm super excited."
"1604640","1606440"," Yeah Brandon's making a good exam. "
"1606580","1611320"," He's saying it's an administration or a technical path once you've reached like a certain level of"
"1611320","1612680"," employment for a company or."
"1616420","1619840"," Yeah hey Connor I gotta say Connor email me again."
"1620120","1621400"," Try to email me again. "
"1621840","1623360"," I want you guys to know something too."
"1624220","1626780"," Some like my DMS are open on Twitter."
"1627160","1629580"," They normally for most people they wouldn't be open. "
"1630180","1634540"," Unless I contacted you first on Twitter and the issue here is that I get."
"1636000","1644520"," 20 10 to 20 minimum DMS a day on Twitter sometimes more 30 40 DMS. I get 10 to 20"
"1644520","1648580"," DMS in discord and then I get 50 emails a day. "
"1649200","1651620"," On the business email it is non stop."
"1651620","1658380"," And I have a full time person to have somebody that reviews a lot of that stuff every day and"
"1658380","1659920"," we just can't keep up right now."
"1660120","1661120"," So I apologize. "
"1661620","1663380"," I do want to say something to you guys though."
"1664340","1666540"," As soon as this shit launches right."
"1668060","1673640"," You're going to get a commitment for me that's way more. "
"1675360","1680340"," I'm way more available to you when we make this jump."
"1681420","1685960"," To where I can focus more on your needs."
"1687300","1689480"," So it's like when you're when everything is free right. "
"1690080","1695120"," You end up all I end up having myself and a bunch of other people Joe Quinn."
"1696840","1697660"," John L."
"1698380","1699060"," Rob SFO."
"1699340","1700140"," Ray ofology. "
"1700400","1703260"," All these like admins and moderators blind nest owl."
"1703780","1704680"," He trading shorts."
"1706100","1707860"," You've got pinky out there. "
"1707960","1709000"," You've got bork here."
"1710540","1711960"," When everything is free."
"1712180","1716220"," It's like I have to like pick up some of that slack along the way. "
"1717080","1720820"," And it really is as we've grown to this point of disservice to you."
"1720920","1722480"," You guys really need me here."
"1722480","1723340"," In my view. "
"1723400","1724900"," You need me in the discord."
"1725020","1725880"," You need me on Twitter."
"1726660","1728860"," To be able to answer questions. "
"1729320","1729800"," Help you along."
"1731620","1732600"," Try to like that."
"1732780","1735720"," Especially that market awareness side of what you're doing kind of stuff. "
"1736360","1738300"," And so this jump."
"1739160","1742400"," Is supposed to allow me to become free."
"1742820","1744840"," To spend time focusing on you. "
"1745320","1749920"," You know sometimes I'm in stream to and I'm like focusing on shit that has nothing to do with the"
"1749920","1750200"," market."
"1750200","1751600"," Even today."
"1752080","1756580"," And this stuff needs to go away when we make this jump so that I can be there for you. "
"1757620","1759860"," All the time as much as I can be at that point."
"1760040","1761760"," So you should see more consistency."
"1762600","1764860"," Come out from our side of things. "
"1764880","1769080"," I can start to pay people to be available."
"1769520","1770100"," That kind of stuff."
"1770600","1772620"," A lot of the background stuff. "
"1772800","1778380"," The development all that shit can start to get paid in a better way and make things easier."
"1781220","1782000"," Good morning everybody."
"1782180","1782560"," How y'all doing?"
"1782680","1782900"," Good morning. "
"1783020","1784040"," How are you man?"
"1787890","1792970"," A rough estimate for someone that just wants to use the TV tool on their own."
"1793130","1794450"," I think we have that somewhere."
"1795370","1796350"," I don't know what the price that is. "
"1796490","1799910"," But I think there is a way for you to just take the tool."
"1800150","1801030"," And that's another thing too."
"1801410","1803950"," I realize some of you just want to chat in the show. "
"1804670","1807310"," So that that five dollar a month thing will always be there."
"1807370","1808130"," If you want to do that."
"1808670","1809970"," You don't want to be a part of the discord. "
"1809970","1813530"," You don't want to have access to the tool on the website."
"1813770","1815590"," So there's like some a la carte shit too."
"1815750","1818910"," Like there will be some a la carte stuff. "
"1819190","1826790"," And we're building out also some truly free stuff on the website paper trading."
"1827790","1828770"," That's not out yet."
"1828910","1830050"," It won't be out for some time. "
"1830210","1835970"," But we have like paper trading stuff and options are free options, profit calculator, free levels."
"1836510","1838510"," I think that will be available right when we launch."
"1839650","1843190"," So again, a bunch of stuff for point blank free. "
"1844030","1846650"," And then we have like some a la carte stuff."
"1846790","1848690"," So if you're like, I just like watching the show man and chat."
"1849470","1850430"," That's still five bucks. "
"1850590","1850930"," That's it."
"1851990","1855130"," If you're like, I just want to take the tool and run away and not watch the show."
"1855210","1857470"," I think the sock or I don't have time to watch the show. "
"1857650","1859530"," I just want the tool and I don't use discord."
"1859750","1861510"," There's not a card option for that as well."
"1863410","1865090"," So yes, to answer your question. "
"1865450","1865570"," Yes."
"1868510","1870950"," I already got rid of I monetized my meta puts."
"1871550","1872990"," Oh, yeah, market update. "
"1873210","1873390"," Okay."
"1873690","1876710"," So, uh, meta puts I monetized."
"1877410","1880090"," Uh, I am in spy puts right now. "
"1880110","1881090"," They're getting destroyed."
"1882010","1883330"," I haven't even checked them this morning."
"1883330","1888970"," I think I was down, uh, 50 or maybe 50 or 70% yesterday. "
"1889530","1890410"," Until the ramp."
"1890670","1892050"," I think I'm getting destroyed on those."
"1892330","1892770"," I haven't looked this. "
"1892770","1897690"," I haven't opened my brokerage yet, but I'm holding those until into the end of the month puts on"
"1897690","1899870"," spy stay on until the 31st."
"1900350","1902110"," Um, they don't come off."
"1902650","1903350"," Now Tesla. "
"1904030","1907010"," I had a chance to monetize Tesla and I did not."
"1908030","1909990"," Uh, I had a chance dude."
"1910210","1912350"," I had a chance two days ago to monetize. "
"1912510","1915770"," I think and I did not monetize now."
"1916770","1919190"," I'm kind of we can take a look at Tesla briefly."
"1919970","1921490"," I'm kind of pissy here. "
"1921490","1923910"," So this is Tesla down below."
"1924270","1924350"," Okay."
"1925250","1929610"," Uh, and now, now, now, hear me out here. "
"1929670","1929910"," Okay."
"1930610","1933630"," I literally bought Tesla like right here."
"1934430","1935930"," Like right there. "
"1936530","1937810"," That's where I bought Tesla."
"1939390","1944330"," So I'm not angry at myself because I'm at the right side of a move higher."
"1946330","1947330"," So I currently. "
"1948190","1950030"," I'm at the I'm where I should be."
"1951490","1955410"," Uh, so I'm like red top of a of this kind of stuff now."
"1956510","1957770"," Saying that right. "
"1958330","1960070"," Uh, I think yesterday I was up."
"1960470","1962050"," Uh, what was that?"
"1963030","1965370"," 10 or 30% or something like that."
"1966030","1970330"," And then the clothes I was looking to see if it would ramp up high enough and it didn't. "
"1970330","1973150"," They pinned that shit right to fucking four 15."
"1973430","1975950"," I was watching it in the four, four PM."
"1976130","1976830"," I was watching it. "
"1977130","1979190"," Uh, and then I was watching it after close."
"1979570","1981570"," It didn't, it went up, but not like it should have."
"1982770","1988350"," Now we're on that with this trade on Tesla for myself for how managing it is. "
"1988930","1992030"," Um, I did not want to hold through their report."
"1992870","1995090"," I have been collecting some money."
"1995370","1998530"," Uh, that's been saving the theta burn through premium. "
"1999270","2003590"," Uh, so gamblers are paying for me to stay in the trade right now, basically."
"2004670","2011510"," Uh, so I'm still in that trade because the gamblers are stepping in for the, for the ER report, so"
"2011510","2012510"," they've kind of kept me afloat."
"2013390","2017110"," Um, I don't, I hate getting trapped into ER. "
"2018090","2024050"," Uh, I was trying to catch the turn into ER, but like sell before ER."
"2024950","2027870"," So my hope is to get rid of those fucking things today."
"2027870","2033550"," If I get caught in that trade, uh, holding overnight, I'll let you know. "
"2034270","2036590"," Uh, if I close those things or what?"
"2036970","2039810"," Um, I'm a little pissy right now that I didn't close that trade."
"2041010","2045890"," And, you know, it's going to, it's going to, it's going to matter with the, what the calls are"
"2045890","2049650"," worth, uh, into the, um, into the end of the day today."
"2050389","2051949"," So, and they're for the 26. "
"2052550","2056949"," So, uh, my, my one fucking issue here with Tesla is."
"2058350","2061070"," You know, I got to talk to you guys about something here."
"2061250","2070330"," So my one real issue here with Tesla is that, um, we should talk about this. "
"2070590","2074830"," So I talked to Joe about this and I should talk to you guys about this."
"2074870","2081030"," So you could see Netflix was ramping into their earnings, right?"
"2083130","2087630"," Uh, you saw that their report was, mixed."
"2090190","2094310"," You already know, we already know as a group that CTAs are long. "
"2095070","2099510"," We know that price has not gone low enough to trigger them to sell."
"2100090","2102210"," We know where the CTAs are positioned every day."
"2103350","2108130"," Um, if, if they're, if the market begins to sell, which would trigger CTAs to sell, we know where"
"2108130","2108430"," that is. "
"2108530","2111670"," So, uh, they're long Netflix, right?"
"2111890","2112910"," We ramped up into their ER."
"2112910","2115690"," They looked for any excuse to monetize on the upside."
"2116330","2117250"," They did, right?"
"2117850","2117870"," Boom. "
"2118210","2118550"," Get a print."
"2119190","2122050"," You saw the selling action into Netflix into the clothes yesterday."
"2122450","2128630"," There were, those were CTAs selling the profit, uh, on that rip up to 500 last night, right?"
"2129030","2130770"," So you saw some of the selling action. "
"2131070","2132670"," You know where the triggers are to sell."
"2133810","2138530"," But what really scares me here is that if they're long, like Netflix, right?"
"2139110","2140750"," They're probably short Tesla."
"2140750","2148850"," So they're going to be looking for any fucking excuse to dump Tesla, right?"
"2149190","2152710"," As they monetize the rest of the market in this ER season. "
"2153690","2156490"," Think about this, like a, like a bunch of wheels together, right?"
"2156690","2161230"," They're going to be monetizing what they're long in on any excuse for good news."
"2162030","2165210"," And then they're going to be looking to get Tesla as cheap as possible."
"2165930","2172670"," So that when this market does roll down, uh, they can buy Tesla or rotate into Tesla when it's dirt"
"2172670","2173050"," cheap. "
"2173670","2179190"," So I'm kind of scared here into this ER, unless there's something really, truly unknown in"
"2179190","2184070"," gangster, uh, that, uh, like an inverse similar to Netflix."
"2184730","2188030"," Uh, like they're just, they were looking for an excuse to get paid yesterday, right?"
"2188210","2188470"," On Netflix."
"2189370","2195370"," Uh, so I realized I was on stream yesterday and read through all the numbers and said, you know,"
"2195490","2201010"," mixed bag report, but they're got or their future guidance, uh, for, for 2024 looks outstanding in"
"2201010","2204070"," these numbers that they're showing, um, for growth. "
"2204470","2208450"," But you know, it's still looked like, hey, we, like I'm a CT and I'm on Netflix."
"2208610","2210090"," And I want to get fucking paid."
"2210590","2212490"," So ramp it up, get me paid. "
"2213130","2214210"," I'll sell into that strength."
"2215390","2221110"," And then by the end of earning season, all these tickers that they're long in, they're monetizing,"
"2221110","2221490"," right?"
"2221490","2224830"," Selling into that strength, selling into that strength, selling into that strength."
"2225450","2228290"," And next thing you know, I'm a CTA and I'm out, right?"
"2228770","2229030"," Bumper. "
"2229670","2229870"," It's bumper."
"2231530","2236250"," Uh, but meanwhile, you've got some tickers that you can see, they're short or they don't own,"
"2237010","2237170"," right?"
"2237370","2238470"," These guys don't own Tesla."
"2239350","2242350"," Uh, this is likely a, a pear trade short against Tesla. "
"2242890","2244650"," And they're looking for a lower price."
"2244910","2249870"," So I'm, I'm a little concerned here with Tesla's, I'm concerned here with Tesla's ER that if, if"
"2249870","2252230"," there's a, if there's a reason to sell, they will."
"2252830","2253630"," Any reason. "
"2253950","2257030"," So if they miss anything, hey, we, we start selling."
"2257330","2258650"," Now, is that necessarily bearish?"
"2259030","2259110"," No."
"2259750","2263810"," You know, from, you guys know from my point of view that I don't believe in fundamentals. "
"2265310","2268930"," I do when it comes to fraud and shit, but I don't believe in them."
"2269030","2271970"," I believe in like, I believe in accumulation and distribution."
"2273070","2278290"," And that the price of a stock tick tick technically doesn't have anything to do with the stock"
"2278290","2279390"," itself or the name. "
"2280030","2286410"," Tesla to me or any other ticker out there, generally speaking, uh, the price of that stock has"
"2286410","2289690"," nothing to do with the company."
"2290370","2294770"," It's a matter of accumulating it cheap and selling it expensive."
"2295450","2300670"," So if I was a market maker, if I was a bank, I'd want it as cheap as possible to"
"2300670","2301070"," long it. "
"2301070","2307230"," And I am afraid of, I am, I'm, we have a bear cross confirmation right there."
"2307390","2308130"," Just the heads up here."
"2308750","2311570"," This is not good right here watching that rejection right there. "
"2313690","2317470"," Anyways, if you disagree with this, that's fine."
"2319870","2321870"," You guys have been here."
"2321990","2323290"," So I read an article this morning. "
"2324210","2327630"," I read an article this morning on fortune about Tesla."
"2329410","2332410"," And there remember, you guys are going to give you two predictions."
"2332690","2336850"," I said, uh, they're going to deliver cyber trucks before the end of the year. "
"2336870","2337550"," We got that."
"2337950","2343450"," And then I told you the second one was going to be that they're going to try to, um, they're"
"2343450","2346910"," going to try to push a narrative of, of a real self driving."
"2348590","2353670"," And I said, that didn't come true, but we are on January 24th. "
"2354350","2356590"," And they're pushing that narrative this week."
"2359330","2362250"," That they have got real self driving."
"2362550","2365490"," Matter of fact, my Mars catalog did a post about it. "
"2366470","2372470"," And I think he was given a version of that, uh, AI through AI FSD."
"2373390","2380470"," And even in that article, they said it's going to be, um, it's not going to be real."
"2381270","2389370"," So that article that just came out in fortune matches what I was told a year ago, um, to what,"
"2389370","2390830"," what to expect at the end of the year. "
"2390910","2392870"," It's a month late, but it's close enough."
"2393110","2394890"," It's hand grenades and horse shoes with that news."
"2395170","2399490"," So, um, hold on a second here. "
"2400670","2402590"," I got to, I got to take this phone call here."
"2402710","2403310"," Let me call you guys back."
"2403510","2404650"," I got to go off stream really quick. "
"2405610","2406810"," I'll be right back with you guys."
"2440560","2443140"," And here, and that's a global number, not us."
"2443860","2449080"," I mean, Netflix, I believe when they launched this a year ago, they said to advertisers, we should"
"2449080","2453480"," be at about 40 million M.A. Us by the end of the year, they're at 23 million. "
"2453820","2455060"," It's taken a little bit longer."
"2455200","2456700"," It's not a concern at all."
"2457000","2461780"," I mean, what we clearly see is that eyeballs and viewing is moving from linear to streaming. "
"2462240","2463500"," Advertising will as well."
"2464160","2464180"," Yeah."
"2464380","2465980"," CTV is going to continue to grow. "
"2465980","2468680"," Netflix has a view where they're going to have the eyeball."
"2468740","2472820"," To the extent they've won the war then, Alan, what does it mean for those who were participating in"
"2472820","2473180"," it previously?"
"2474380","2475380"," It's going to get a lot tougher."
"2475520","2481320"," I mean, one would think that, you know, the speculation on Paramount that Skydance is going to buy"
"2481320","2486540"," them or someone else is going to buy them, or even if they stay independent, they may have to close"
"2486540","2491000"," the streaming business and go back to becoming a content seller. "
"2491320","2493020"," They can't afford those losses."
"2493720","2499120"," Comcast, your parent company, is losing over $2 billion a year at Peacock."
"2499440","2502060"," Brian is not going to stand for that for very long. "
"2502420","2507440"," Does it make sense that maybe a Peacock and a Max merge?"
"2507460","2509000"," There will be fewer streamers."
"2509120","2510860"," I mean, Netflix even said they'll be consolidation."
"2511680","2512660"," Just adds up to you. "
"2512720","2519320"," If you are a Tesla bull or on Twitter, the hourly trigger is reversing to the upside right now."
"2519320","2524260"," I mean, I love that shareholder letter because pay attention to this green line right here."
"2524660","2528600"," So that green line is rolling to the upside even though price is lower. "
"2529220","2534900"," The Tesla is looking like it wants to on a competition effect Netflix and ultimately wants to ramp"
"2534900","2536320"," the upside of these here."
"2537500","2539260"," Maybe tag that 235."
"2539940","2541220"," It's not a long term issue. "
"2541480","2542620"," There will be a few competitors."
"2543040","2545320"," Disney is not going away."
"2545320","2547560"," Universal is not going away. "
"2548060","2552640"," I mean, these are strong companies, but there will be less competition than we've had the last few"
"2552640","2553000"," years."
"2553680","2555680"," Netflix said 260 million subs."
"2556040","2559240"," I think they'll be able to grow their subs 20 million subs a year. "
"2559540","2561600"," They grew almost 30 million last year."
"2561840","2563560"," Some benefit to the password crackdown."
"2564260","2567120"," But there's 500 million total available market. "
"2567440","2570000"," So they can continue to grow 20 million subs a year."
"2570560","2572280"," Raise price to add revenue comes in."
"2572920","2574340"," It's a pretty strong story. "
"2574340","2575640"," They're competition though."
"2575780","2576760"," It's also TikTok."
"2576940","2577760"," It's short form video. "
"2578380","2581100"," You know, there's still plenty of competition out there."
"2581360","2586060"," Yeah, even jokes today about why the call is on YouTube as opposed to Netflix."
"2587320","2587680"," Fascinating. "
"2587680","2589060"," And it's amazing not that long ago."
"2589160","2591040"," People wondered what do they know about the ad business?"
"2591560","2593040"," They've shown a lot of people the answer."
"2593180","2594020"," Alan, thank you for coming in. "
"2594220","2594780"," Good night, Carl."
"2595200","2595420"," Alan, good night."
"2596420","2600300"," As we're going to break to the roadmap for the rest of the hour, stocks are pushing higher to some"
"2600300","2601940"," new highs on the S&P and NASDAQ. "
"2601940","2603040"," We'll get a read on this rally."
"2603480","2608340"," Plus an exclusive interview with the CEO of William Sonoma, her take on the consumer and the"
"2608340","2609140"," economy right now."
"2609440","2611360"," And Tesla is gearing up to report its earnings. "
"2611600","2612600"," That'll be after the bell today."
"2612820","2613560"," We're going to get you ready."
"2613760","2614700"," We got a big show ahead. "
"2614880","2615700"," Squawk on the streets back."
"2616020","2616220"," Later."
"2773710","2775170"," We fly safe planes. "
"2775570","2779290"," We don't put airplanes in the air that we don't have 100% confidence in."
"2780090","2782310"," I'm here today in the spirit of transparency."
"2782790","2785850"," Number one, recognize the seriousness of what you just asked. "
"2786570","2792670"," Number two, to share everything I can with our Capitol Hill interests and answer all their"
"2792670","2794270"," questions because they have a lot of them."
"2795350","2799370"," That's Boeing's chief Dave Calhoun moments ago, arriving on Capitol Hill to me with lawmakers."
"2800030","2803030"," Let's get to Emily Wilkins on the Hill with more on what's on the agenda. "
"2803250","2803590"," Hey, Emily."
"2804870","2808210"," Hey, so yeah, Calhoun just walked into Senator Mark Warner's office."
"2808210","2811330"," He's one of two senators from Virginia where, of course, Boeing is headquartered. "
"2811930","2816770"," But he's also said to meet today with the heads of the Senate panel that oversees all of aviation,"
"2817070","2817410"," the commerce."
"2817810","2821710"," That includes its chair, Maria Cantwell, and then tomorrow he's expected to meet with the top"
"2821710","2823510"," Republican on the panel Ted Cruz."
"2823990","2828070"," And part of this kind of as he said, it's to go ahead and preemptively deliver a message that"
"2828070","2832270"," Boeing has confidence in its planes, that they don't put unsafe planes in the sky. "
"2832470","2835510"," But also remember the Senate has an oversight function here."
"2835510","2837870"," We heard earlier today from Senator Jerry Moran."
"2838490","2840430"," He was also a part of that aviation panel. "
"2840850","2843350"," And he said, look, there could potentially be investigations."
"2843370","2845130"," There could potentially be legislation."
"2845990","2850330"," And so it seems like part of Calhoun's reason for being here today is to kind of talk with"
"2850330","2854790"," senators, get a sense of the lay of the land, really deliver his message and kind of get a sense"
"2854790","2857910"," for what, if anything is coming next in terms of an investigation. "
"2858630","2864950"," I also did ask him about reports today that it was Boeing, rather than their supplier who did put"
"2864950","2866830"," that panel on the plane incorrectly."
"2867550","2872290"," And his response immediately was just to say that there is already an agency looking into that and"
"2872290","2873190"," left it at that."
"2873410","2877770"," So for all those talk of transparency, certainly not something he wanted to discuss with the press"
"2877770","2878170"," today. "
"2878530","2879170"," Back to you guys."
"2879490","2879830"," All right."
"2879930","2882510"," Yeah, we did hear that off camera while you were asking that question. "
"2882590","2883210"," Emily, thank you."
"2883430","2884330"," Emily Wilkinson DC."
"2884610","2885590"," Let's get back to the market. "
"2885590","2889370"," We're rallying the S&P in the NASDAQ art record highs."
"2889370","2894730"," And on pace at least if they were to end higher today, four would be five straight days of gains."
"2895250","2897030"," Papa Sondice here at Post 9."
"2897030","2898150"," Let's cut your ride today. "
"2898470","2899250"," We're melting up again."
"2899650","2901310"," It's getting a little more narrow again."
"2901530","2903150"," That alarms me, but it's Goldilocks. "
"2903430","2905610"," Inflation is falling and growth is holding up."
"2905770","2907750"," And sentiment seems to be improving a little bit."
"2907970","2909510"," That's about as Goldilocks as it gets. "
"2909870","2912170"," We've got a small group of companies that are doing pretty well."
"2912350","2914210"," A lot of big momentum, I call it."
"2914590","2919450"," Yes, you know about Nvidia, yeah, you know about Microsoft, but insurance companies haven't strong"
"2919450","2920910"," ever since those travelers report. "
"2921110","2924090"," It was just knock them off the socks kind of report here."
"2924510","2926350"," Some of the pharmaceuticals have been doing better."
"2926590","2928390"," Merck's had some nice momentum recently. "
"2929170","2931390"," All the card companies, Visa's been strong."
"2931930","2933230"," Mastercard's been strong as well."
"2933650","2937250"," But still it's been the rally is getting narrower. "
"2937590","2939670"," It's not broadening out like we were hoping it was."
"2939870","2941710"," Just take a look at the sector leaders this month."
"2941750","2945410"," You'll see it's semiconductors and it's mostly Nvidia AMD Broadcom. "
"2945410","2948850"," There's a small group of sector leaders in the semiconductor space."
"2949010","2950750"," It's doing well communication services."
"2950770","2953670"," Again, this is Netflix, Meta, and Alphabet. "
"2954010","2957210"," Put up the sector laggards, leaders there in healthcare."
"2957550","2959130"," Like I said, some of the farmers doing better."
"2959450","2960110"," Banks have been flat. "
"2960530","2961830"," Look at what's lagging though here."
"2962070","2963630"," Consumer staples aren't really doing much."
"2963950","2967110"," Industrials, consumer discretionary energy to the downside. "
"2967590","2970330"," So we wanted this to broaden out a little and it's not right now."
"2971210","2974030"," Elsewhere, speaking of broadening out, how about the IPO market?"
"2974250","2974990"," When is it going to happen?"
"2974990","2975810"," We keep waiting."
"2976030","2977890"," There's a few deals this week. "
"2978010","2983250"," Friday at Nasdaq will have a nice little home and community-based healthcare services group that's"
"2983250","2983750"," going to be out."
"2983910","2984530"," That's Bright Spring."
"2984810","2987050"," They'll raise maybe $900 billion. "
"2987530","2988190"," It's not a bad deal."
"2988830","2990050"," That's a little bright spot."
"2990450","2991890"," The big one is next week though. "
"2992050","2994370"," We're going to have Amr Sports here."
"2994510","2996770"," These are the people who own Wilson Sporting Goods."
"2997070","2997330"," Remember them?"
"2997670","2999150"," Big international sports brands. "
"2999870","3001550"," This is going to be a fairly big deal."
"3001730","3003990"," They're going to try to raise close to $1.7 billion."
"3003990","3006310"," Maybe have an $8 billion market cap. "
"3006690","3007370"," That's nice, brother."
"3007370","3008650"," That's so many out there."
"3008850","3012190"," Reddit, Del Monte, Panera, Siki, Sheen, Circleway. "
"3012290","3012630"," Go on."
"3012770","3016190"," I did a whole story if you want to know about it last week on Trader Talk."
"3016750","3017690"," We'll see what's going on. "
"3017790","3018870"," Finally, a topic."
"3019290","3020430"," Dear to your heart, SPACs."
"3020570","3026510"," Gary Gensler, as we speak, the SEC Commissioners are voting on tightening the rules on SPACs three"
"3026510","3027170"," years late. "
"3027510","3028230"," Thank you for that."
"3028530","3029530"," But they're doing something."
"3029830","3031630"," So here's the key point what they're trying to do. "
"3032170","3033890"," They're going to tighten the loophole."
"3036250","3041810"," Companies were able, the target companies for these SPACs were able to make outrageous forward"
"3041810","3046210"," statements because there was a loophole in the law that didn't specifically bring them in."
"3046590","3047990"," So here, they're going to close the loophole. "
"3048530","3051850"," The target company is now going to be liable for the statements on the future results."
"3052270","3053130"," That wasn't clear before."
"3053410","3055050"," That's how they got away with these outrageous statements. "
"3055730","3057330"," Also, there is a safe harbor provision."
"3057330","3061610"," So, you know, when companies make comments about future earnings, there's a safe harbor provision."
"3061770","3064070"," You can't sue them if they make reasonable efforts. "
"3064530","3067090"," Here, under IPOs, they're exempt."
"3067630","3072590"," And that's why you, from the safe harbor, that's why you see them being very careful in IPOs about"
"3072590","3073270"," future statements."
"3073930","3075430"," That was not clear in SPACs. "
"3075730","3079410"," You think how could it not be spent a lot of time during the height of the SPAC raisin is"
"3079410","3084850"," looking at those very numbers and the perspectives in the presentations that would be made."
"3084850","3087450"," And I always had fun with them because they were absurd."
"3087970","3088150"," Yeah. "
"3088370","3093630"," Completely and totally absurd in terms of what they saw in 26 and 27 and where they thought their"
"3093630","3099350"," value would be based on a multiple, some crazy EBITDA number that in no way was truly going to"
"3099350","3099610"," happen."
"3099630","3104310"," So now the companies that are the targets and the auditors that are in them are going to have to"
"3104310","3109010"," sign on to the legal registration, that's going to make them legally liable."
"3109010","3112610"," And they're not going to have a safe harbor provision where they can say, oh, we're making"
"3112610","3114870"," reasonable, you can't sue us because we're making reasonable assets. "
"3115210","3118950"," So it's basically a green light Gensler is giving to them saying, go ahead."
"3118950","3122330"," If these people are making outrageous statements, they're not protected by anything."
"3122510","3124350"," Those were far past the height of the crisis. "
"3124350","3125670"," Close the barn door after, yes."
"3125870","3128990"," But, you know, the SEC's position is it does in fairness to them."
"3129050","3130550"," It does take some time for them to get it out. "
"3130950","3131750"," Bob, thank you."
"3132670","3135730"," Meantime, Bitcoin is higher today trading just below 40k."
"3135870","3141370"," The crypto currencies fallen about 15% since the launch of those ETFs and one of those big funds"
"3141370","3142850"," seen a lot of money leaving. "
"3143050","3144730"," Kate Rooney is following all that action today."
"3144810","3145130"," Morning, Kate."
"3145490","3146070"," Hey, Carl. "
"3146170","3146450"," Good morning."
"3146590","3149570"," Bitcoin ETFs have seen more than a billion in net inflows so far."
"3149770","3153610"," But there is one firm with, by far, the most money heading out the door. "
"3154050","3155670"," That is grayscale in the past day alone."
"3155810","3159410"," It's seen about 640 million of outflows as according to fact said."
"3159550","3165650"," And then fun strat, meanwhile, estimates that since these ETFs launch grayscale seen about 3.5"
"3165650","3166630"," billion in outflows. "
"3166850","3172550"," If you compare that to the other top names in this race, take BlackRock's ETF, it saw 1.6 billion"
"3172550","3173970"," come in the door and then fidelity."
"3173990","3175670"," It's ETF not far behind that."
"3175750","3177170"," You can see those on the left side of the chart there. "
"3177290","3182870"," Grayscale is still the largest, about 21 billion in assets compared to under 2 billion for"
"3182870","3183330"," BlackRock."
"3183510","3185270"," There are a few reasons, guys, about Exodus."
"3185610","3187670"," One is this successful arbitrage trade. "
"3187850","3192630"," Grayscale had an existing publicly traded product and then it converted into an ETF."
"3192890","3197630"," And before it was an ETF, GBTC is a ticker's note, traded at a discounted Bitcoin."
"3197630","3201930"," So some traders got in and they bet that that discount would disappear, which it did. "
"3202470","3203570"," Now they're taking some profits."
"3203850","3204730"," And then there are bankruptcy."
"3205190","3209530"," So companies like FTX held GBTC in their now selling as they restructure. "
"3209770","3212450"," FTX, for example, had about 22 million shares of grayscale."
"3212450","3214970"," That's adding to some pressure according to fun strat."
"3215070","3221190"," And then those fees, guys, grayscale charges 1.5% compared to 0 or around 2% for some of"
"3221190","3224630"," the other, 0.2% rather for some of the other ETFs. "
"3224630","3227990"," Bitcoin's price is still very much driven by some of the macro news out there."
"3228050","3231690"," It's still a lot more important right now to watch things like strength in the dollar, re-pricing"
"3231690","3236950"," of fed fun futures, FOMC meeting next week to get an idea of where interest rates are headed."
"3237310","3241690"," So some of the same things that are driving tech are still really what matters in crypto markets. "
"3242030","3242390"," Back to you guys."
"3242630","3242930"," Right."
"3244090","3248530"," So since the ETF was a driver and the sentiment around it for so long, what is it now?"
"3248750","3249690"," Is it an inflation hedge?"
"3249890","3250550"," Is it a safe haven?"
"3250930","3253570"," Is it an unprofitable tech stock in the NASDAQ?"
"3253570","3255990"," It's still a high beta tech play. "
"3256210","3260510"," And a lot of people, there are investors out there who see it as a hedge against inflation, see it"
"3260510","3262930"," as this flight to safety and sort of compare it to digital gold."
"3263190","3268830"," There's other idiosyncratic crypto events like this having that's coming up this year, but really"
"3268830","3272970"," it's still a tech play, high beta, high risk play at this point."
"3273170","3274830"," We'll see it up if that evolves over time. "
"3275290","3275670"," All right."
"3275690","3275810"," Okay."
"3275970","3276210"," Thank you. "
"3276530","3280750"," Up next, an exclusive interview with the CEO of William Sonoma on the health of the consumer."
"3280750","3281790"," State of the economy."
"3282050","3283510"," How AI is playing into that business. "
"3283530","3286770"," And once she's optimistic this year, swap on the street is back in two."
"3469440","3470160"," Welcome back."
"3470420","3471060"," Let's talk retail. "
"3471240","3474760"," State of the consumer key focus at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week."
"3475060","3479640"," I sat down with Laura Albert, the CEO of William Sonoma to discuss how her business has been doing"
"3479640","3480260"," post COVID."
"3480340","3485120"," Remember it boomed during the pandemic when everyone was at home, but the give back post COVID for"
"3485120","3488620"," categories like furniture and home goods has been rough across the board. "
"3488620","3490180"," Here's what she's seeing right now."
"3491420","3492700"," It hasn't been that tough."
"3493100","3498520"," We had a little give back after incredible surge during COVID, but you know, people still love"
"3498520","3499040"," their homes. "
"3499700","3505020"," They're entertaining at home, cooking at home, and the home is still the most important part of"
"3505020","3505440"," their life."
"3506240","3510860"," And as we go into 2024, everyone is talking about health and wellness."
"3511920","3517020"," And I think what's exciting is that when you think about home, that's the place where you develop"
"3517020","3518220"," those healthy habits. "
"3518580","3523620"," And so there's a lot that we have in the pipeline to really capitalize on those trends."
"3523980","3530100"," Sort of to drive the secular growth at a time where, I mean, there are questions about Americans"
"3530640","3533440"," prioritizing spending, for instance, on their homes."
"3533900","3535060"," Mortgage rates have been very high. "
"3535600","3537560"," They've stabilized and come down a little bit."
"3537720","3539080"," Do you see a bottoming?"
"3539580","3541100"," I don't know about a bottoming."
"3541100","3547480"," I think that, you know, plateau is kind of how I think about planning this year because I'm not"
"3547480","3550640"," relying on the macro improving to drive our business. "
"3551160","3552820"," And I'm also not expecting a disaster."
"3553580","3558320"," So if it stays where it is, we have plenty of great growth opportunities to drive it."
"3558600","3559820"," And that's what I'm looking forward to. "
"3560260","3562940"," I mean, with the top line declines, you've seen increasing profitability."
"3563700","3567520"," Well, that's a whole separate subject, but yes, big opportunity on the profitability."
"3567520","3570980"," And it was an interesting year because we talked about this last year. "
"3571520","3575600"," And I don't think people really believed how much upside we truly had on the bottom line."
"3575760","3576880"," What is driving that?"
"3577200","3579480"," It's a lot of things, both external and internal."
"3579740","3586840"," So, you know, obviously the supply chain headwinds that we had during COVID have abated. "
"3587400","3593520"," There's new challenges upon us, but those were driving costs of the product up."
"3593520","3596860"," Whether it was the shipping or even just the absolute product's price."
"3597500","3599840"," And so that was, you know, we saw that coming. "
"3600000","3604980"," But at the same time, we also knew that focusing on service and returning to world-class service"
"3604980","3607620"," was going to really drive a ton of savings."
"3608620","3611260"," Even I didn't realize how much that could be."
"3611720","3616800"," You know, when you think about shipping furniture, if you ship it and there's a damage and you have"
"3616800","3620260"," to ship it again, or you're bringing separate products together. "
"3620260","3625340"," And instead of doing one delivery, I have to do three-tier house, you can imagine the costs grow"
"3625340","3626040"," and grow and grow."
"3626640","3633020"," And so now that our supply chain is not only where it was, but is improved, we're seeing a lot"
"3633020","3634420"," more return on the bottom line."
"3634720","3639820"," You're also, I know, experimenting and using generative AI, right, to make things more productive. "
"3640120","3641060"," Where are you in that process?"
"3641700","3643320"," You know, I mean, it's real."
"3643760","3645200"," It's not just an idea for us."
"3645560","3647880"," I mean, there's the obvious things, whether it's copywriting. "
"3647880","3652360"," And, you know, some co-pilot customer service stuff."
"3652940","3659980"," But where I didn't expect it is in supply chain, logistics decisions, where we would have to make"
"3659980","3661840"," those decisions by analyzing things."
"3662460","3668000"," Now we have much more productive, you know, analysis to make better decisions to save us money. "
"3668460","3671620"," So that'll continue to be a growth driver for margins."
"3672360","3677340"," And the other thing that's great and that we've talked about a lot is the relevancy of marketing"
"3677840","3684580"," and using AI to send the most relevant marketing to you, which is, I think, the epitome of"
"3684580","3685880"," excellent customer service."
"3686280","3691700"," What about when it comes to dealing with the consumer and trying to help us figure out what we want"
"3691700","3692560"," and what we want to buy?"
"3692800","3695900"," As I said, I think it's best to be a co-pilot in the background. "
"3696680","3700240"," We're not comfortable yet letting it take over the customer interaction."
"3701120","3704440"," It's just way too important and I want that to be really authentic."
"3704580","3708220"," So that will still be human interaction as it's been for us. "
"3708440","3710100"," You mentioned the supply chain has improved."
"3710100","3713800"," Are you affected at all by what's happening in the Red Sea and the delay of shipments?"
"3714220","3714320"," Yes."
"3714740","3715800"," And so we're rerouting. "
"3715880","3716800"," We have great partners."
"3717580","3721840"," And, you know, the minute the announcement came out that that was happening, unfortunately, we"
"3721840","3724200"," started working on our contingency plans."
"3724720","3725740"," You have a global footprint. "
"3725980","3726780"," You have stores in the least."
"3726780","3729220"," You have manufacturing abroad."
"3730160","3736880"," Just given some of the geopolitical tensions and issues right now, beyond the Red Sea, how's your"
"3736880","3738560"," business impacted by all that?"
"3738860","3739600"," It's hard to know. "
"3739960","3744120"," There's so many different things, as you said, whether it's, you know, housing picking up slightly."
"3745140","3749700"," You know, when we sat here last year, people were very fearful of mass layoffs."
"3750140","3753420"," And while there are still layoffs, it's not quite as acute as it was last year. "
"3753720","3754840"," That's a benefit, right?"
"3754840","3758620"," And, you know, at the same time, there's some costs that are really coming down."
"3758780","3759720"," There's some that are going up."
"3760100","3763600"," When I take it all together, you know, there's a lot of opportunities. "
"3764000","3767220"," There's risks, but I'm optimistic about this."
"3767240","3767820"," You sound very optimistic."
"3769820","3772220"," Laura Alber, CEO of William Sonoma. "
"3772360","3777200"," And guys, it is worth mentioning that stock has been a big out performer, even though they're"
"3777200","3782660"," seeing, you know, double digit declines on revenues because the profitability has really improved."
"3782660","3789080"," And because I think they're in some strong brands, like West Elm, and the market has confidence in"
"3789080","3791540"," her leadership, as they have for a very long time."
"3791880","3796900"," It's outperformed not just the S&P, but even competitors, like maybe it's not so direct because of"
"3796900","3799880"," the price points, but restoration hardware, RH, for instance. "
"3800660","3802180"," It's been a huge out performer on that front."
"3802420","3808340"," And I think the AI story is fascinating just because of the use cases that some of these companies"
"3808340","3813940"," are going through, but also the margin improvement in areas like supply chain really having it"
"3813940","3814700"," making a difference."
"3815120","3815960"," Yeah, that was interesting. "
"3816120","3817660"," You asked her about supply chain overall."
"3817900","3818340"," Yeah."
"3818700","3824200"," And how quickly they had to start to make moves to avoid the risks. "
"3824200","3829140"," We route ships, you know, but these companies are all kind of like, they're battle tested from"
"3829140","3830720"," COVID on supply chain."
"3830720","3836120"," So they're able to make these decisions and these moves much faster than they probably would have"
"3836120","3836420"," otherwise."
"3836640","3841020"," So now this is just sort of like, okay, we can deal with it. "
"3841020","3841960"," It's just going and how to reroute."
"3842740","3846220"," Check out that one year chart that Williamson have up pretty impressive."
"3846840","3851680"," Meantime overall market hitting another intraday record high for the third time in less than a"
"3851680","3851860"," week. "
"3851880","3857000"," If you're looking at the S&P, our next guest finds cyclicals attractive over defensive and growth"
"3857000","3863180"," names, city group, U.S. equity strategist Scott Cronert, S&P target of 5100 joins us here at Post"
"3863180","3863460"," 9."
"3863820","3864240"," Welcome back."
"3864440","3864980"," Good to see you."
"3865140","3866020"," It's seeing you as well. "
"3866020","3872340"," So it is interesting that we continue to see these new highs on the S&P, even though, you know,"
"3872420","3874960"," bond bond yields have been creeping up."
"3875020","3879540"," I mean, we're not seeing any kind of outsized moves, but it used to be that we needed bond yields"
"3879540","3880920"," to fall for the S&P to rally."
"3881200","3881620"," What's happening?"
"3881960","3883580"," So I think there's a few things going on. "
"3883780","3889260"," So, you know, we've had the big rally in Q4 that I think was premised on the 10-year nominal"
"3889260","3891460"," fall from 5 down to 3637."
"3892280","3897800"," That triggered the broadening effect that we still think is part of the 2024 narrative, right?"
"3898380","3902720"," It's taken a little bit of a backseat here to start the year as a function of it as you"
"3902720","3904320"," describe the backup and rates again."
"3904660","3905800"," So we have to keep an eye on that. "
"3905900","3910260"," We continue to think that the 10-year nominal is more important directly for the S&P than it is"
"3910260","3915880"," the Fed Fund's discussion, but I think that's very consistent with the way we're seeing the"
"3915880","3917400"," playbook play out set up for 2024."
"3917940","3923700"," So the current thinking is that the Federal Reserve will start cutting second half of the year"
"3923700","3926580"," maybe toward the end of the first half of the year."
"3926660","3929100"," Does it matter when and how many cuts we get?"
"3929200","3933460"," Because if the market is off on that, then couldn't we see a correction?"
"3933920","3938640"," So I think we've been arguing that the start of the year, we were going to go into Q4 reporting"
"3938640","3938960"," period. "
"3938960","3945860"," We're going to get positive surprises akin to Q3, but your Odyssey for your 24 expectations in"
"3945860","3950640"," general come down as C-suites continue to express some general concern about macro conditions."
"3951400","3956520"," So what we've been expecting is sort of a weaker start to the year than followed by a stronger mid "
"3956520","3961640","-year as you get to that Fed pivot point, whether it's March or May, June, the House view at City"
"3961640","3963220"," is sort of a June first cut."
"3963520","3964060"," It's coming. "
"3964560","3966560"," I think the inflation data tells you that."
"3966860","3971160"," I think we got pretty high conviction that this is just the fate of complete as to win and how"
"3971160","3971400"," much."
"3971940","3977920"," Ultimately, what I really want to see is the Fed begin to talk more about lessening their"
"3977920","3983000"," restrictive approach to the economy and getting closer to something approaching neutral, which is a"
"3983000","3988400"," tough position point on Fed funds to really target at this point. "
"3988740","3994560"," Yeah, Waller kind of started down that road and then put some walls around his commentary in the"
"3994560","3995300"," last couple of weeks."
"3995740","3997920"," 5100 is 4% away."
"3998420","4000920"," Do you feel any pressure to raise your target?"
"4001320","4002060"," Not yet. "
"4002240","4003280"," Look it."
"4003280","4005660"," We've had a consensus on earnings expectations for 2024."
"4005780","4006980"," No change there. "
"4007200","4008640"," We're using a 245 estimate."
"4009440","4011840"," 5100 is 21 times that."
"4012140","4016760"," Now we can talk about valuations if you want, but we're pretty comfortable where we are. "
"4016980","4019920"," Our point here is we want to be in US equities."
"4020160","4021720"," It's a question of where and how and when."
"4022340","4025380"," We're looking for pullbacks to be more aggressively buying into. "
"4026020","4026980"," Holders of growth."
"4027060","4034260"," We think that the latest NASDAQ rally is predicated more on continuing to euphoria on the"
"4034260","4034940"," fundamental front."
"4035140","4036820"," More so than valuations got that. "
"4037280","4040840"," But we think that the next leg of this is going to have to be broadening down the cyclical side."
"4040840","4042180"," We're not getting the broadening yet."
"4042420","4043340"," I mean, I'm looking right now. "
"4043560","4046420"," We've been kidding about not including Tesla anymore in the MAG 7."
"4046520","4046900"," It's up today."
"4047040","4050400"," But NVIDIA is up another 3.5%. It's up 25% this year."
"4050740","4051920"," That is up 11%. "
"4051920","4054140"," This is a MAG 7 market again."
"4054540","4055540"," Well, it is for now."
"4055880","4059160"," Okay, I think we had that we had the Q4 broadening in November of December. "
"4059160","4063880"," To Sarah's point, you know, look at we're we're table pounding bullish on the industrial economy."
"4064520","4068760"," And part of what we're focusing on here is that we think the inherent cyclicality of that part of"
"4068760","4070920"," the market is is much less than historic."
"4071240","4074400"," And the AI influence is part of the discussion here. "
"4074640","4077200"," The ability to manage supply chains much more real time."
"4077420","4080420"," So they buy industrials for AI, not for the economy."
"4080840","4084960"," Buy industrials for what I think is to be lesser cyclicality that is commonly perceived. "
"4085540","4089260"," And I think that's going to end up being a multiple enhancer for that part of the market."
"4089500","4091580"," So I and you know, you've talked about retail."
"4092100","4094280"," Now, you know, we've recently upgraded retail to an overweight. "
"4094740","4096180"," It's premised on the same thing."
"4096260","4100060"," The productivity enhancements that are coming more broadly across the market."
"4100200","4101500"," I think are going to be a pretty big deal. "
"4101819","4103040"," Yes, you're going to measure tech."
"4103300","4108620"," You're going to measure a lot of the big 7 on the actual fundamental dynamics and implications of"
"4108620","4108800"," AI."
"4109220","4111380"," But you're going to see it more broadly over time. "
"4111560","4116160"," I think across the broader economy and you're going to see it in margins and profitability."
"4118580","4120140"," But that's bullish for the overall market then."
"4120300","4120460"," Yeah. "
"4121460","4123220"," You think investors don't appreciate it?"
"4123439","4124819"," I don't think investors appreciate it."
"4124920","4128620"," The pushback I get industrials is still pretty stiff."
"4128979","4129399"," All right, Scott. "
"4129680","4130660"," Thank you for joining us."
"4130880","4131319"," Appreciate it."
"4131460","4131960"," Scott Browner. "
"4132220","4134140"," After the break, we're going to turn back to Netflix."
"4134580","4135840"," That's still up over 12%."
"4135840","4137720"," Of course, off that very strong quarter. "
"4138300","4140479"," And as you see, it is the top gainer on the S&P."
"4140779","4326800"," Got a bunch"
"4326800","4329640"," of new street calls on Netflix following that blowout quarter."
"4329920","4331420"," Don choose tracking some of those. "
"4331500","4331720"," Hey, Don."
"4331860","4332080"," All right."
"4332080","4336740"," So Carl, if you take a look at the price action so far, Netflix remains the most valuable media"
"4336740","4341620"," company in the S&P 500, currently worth about 240 some odd billion dollars. "
"4341960","4346440"," The shares rising right now have put a lot of focus on whether or not they could go even higher"
"4346440","4346940"," than that."
"4347300","4351880"," Taking a look right now at the analyst state of play as things currently stand as these kind of"
"4351880","4357300"," upgrades and price target revisions come in right now, according to facts that 59% of analysts have"
"4357300","4360180"," a buy rating on this 35 a hold and 6% a sell."
"4360620","4362780"," The average target price of $539. "
"4363080","4367540"," Well, that kind of begs the question about whether or not there will be revisions because we're"
"4367540","4368540"," kind of pretty much out there."
"4368660","4370380"," It's not a boat there at this point right now."
"4370680","4375420"," If you look at the way things are panning out, just a bull bear case this morning among the analyst"
"4375420","4376660"," calls coming out on Netflix. "
"4377120","4381840"," First of all, the upgrades coming in from the likes of a Macquarie, the upgrade to outperform"
"4381840","4383580"," Netflix delivered to excellent Q4 results."
"4383840","4388460"," They think that they have been waiting for confirmation that Netflix's moves are paying off and"
"4388460","4389760"," they got it so they get the upgrade."
"4390340","4393600"," On the downgrade side of things, it's not always a bullish case. "
"4394100","4397360"," Analysts at Deutsche Bank have now downgraded that stock to a hold from a buy."
"4397800","4401060"," What they say is that everything that's good has already happened."
"4401200","4402380"," It's already been priced in the stock. "
"4402800","4407080"," We think that Netflix's leadership position is fully priced into the stock at these levels."
"4407340","4409040"," They still think it's the best story in media."
"4409320","4410900"," So we'll keep an eye David on what's happening there. "
"4410960","4411880"," I'll send things back over to you."
"4412300","4415200"," Yeah, that's kind of brave for them to do that."
"4415200","4417480"," At least we'll see if they choose to be right. "
"4417740","4424640"," And of course Thomas, you know, Marc de Capwise at that 243 level, it equals Disney Fox, Warner"
"4424640","4426940"," Brothers Discovery and Paramount combined."
"4427700","4431300"," So as we said earlier, Netflix seems to have won that streaming word."
"4431500","4436680"," It also says it's not interested in acquiring linear cable assets or linear assets of any kind. "
"4437260","4443500"," And further does believe that M&A will continue amongst traditional companies and certainly that"
"4443500","4444920"," could change the competitive environment."
"4444920","4446080"," That was all for call yesterday."
"4446580","4451760"," Yesterday, we did speak with the TKO and Endeavour CEO Aria Emmanuel. "
"4452240","4458640"," That on news of that streaming deal, the WWE has with Netflix for its raw property."
"4459120","4463080"," We also talked about what he's seeing overall and what the deal says about the media landscape."
"4464620","4466320"," You all think linear is going away. "
"4466480","4467700"," I don't think cable is going away."
"4468000","4470340"," But there is a push to streaming."
"4470340","4479520"," You know, on this deal, we did that early on with the UFC, on ESPN and plus. "
"4480860","4484560"," From our perspective, this is the next iteration of where this sport has go."
"4484760","4488320"," We have a linear play with SmackDown and with NXT."
"4488780","4490280"," This is the streaming play. "
"4490700","4493560"," And so for us, you know, it was the next step."
"4493920","4496980"," It's a great deal for Netflix in our opinion."
"4496980","4501700"," You know, they get 150 hours of programming, right?"
"4502360","4503980"," Over five billion dollars. "
"4504680","4507460"," It's like two, two and a half movies for 150."
"4507640","4510380"," And for us, it's the global player in streaming."
"4511240","4513760"," And the dominant player in streaming, of course, as well. "
"4514000","4518740"," And it was quite a quarter just to reiterate again the things we've been talking about in terms of"
"4518740","4524660"," the subscription numbers alone, Carl coming in so far above what had been estimates and not just"
"4524660","4528160"," from cracking down on password sharing, it would seem, but from overall demand."
"4528980","4534260"," Yeah, I remember when, as I mentioned a moment ago, when they did a U-turn on ads were like,"
"4534480","4539020"," how are you going to start this business from scratch, even with Microsoft's help and the U-turns"
"4539020","4542020"," on gaming and live events and live sports."
"4542200","4546760"," And even if you go way, way back on original content, who knows if that's been a rope a dope"
"4546760","4548120"," or if they really did change their mind?"
"4548540","4549800"," Yeah, I know. "
"4550180","4553820"," To think of like House of Cards, right, when it goes back to that, but they've been amazing at"
"4553820","4554200"," executing."
"4554460","4558680"," They've reinvented the company's numerous times along the way to your point now to focus on gaming"
"4558680","4561060"," and live sports being added as well."
"4561660","4565020"," It is the, it's the category killer. "
"4565480","4565780"," Yeah."
"4565960","4567380"," And still not back to all-time us."
"4567800","4569700"," We'll watch that trend line. "
"4570000","4573940"," Still to come, the first of the MAG-7 names, Tesla, to report tonight."
"4574180","4576820"," We're going to talk about what the streets expecting when we're back in two."
"4579300","4744980"," The app"
"4744980","4745280"," today. "
"4746500","4749160"," Lots of movement this morning when it comes to AI."
"4749980","4755400"," SAP announcing its plan to carry out a restructuring plan, covering 8,000 employees."
"4755620","4761160"," Not clear exactly what that means, but it's all in a push toward AI and AI-driven business areas. "
"4761400","4763100"," The company shares hitting a record high."
"4763680","4767900"," Meantime Alphabet is cutting ties with the Australian AI firm that helped train its bard and Google"
"4767900","4773640"," search products for decision-impacting roughly 2,000 sub-contracted alphabet workers according to"
"4773640","4774480"," the company's union."
"4775540","4778640"," Everyone's still clearly trying to pivot toward AI. "
"4779640","4784680"," In Java's IASTE on Mark Benioff, whether he feels that he is getting enough credit from the market"
"4784680","4788820"," when it comes to AI compared to companies like Alphabet, Microsoft and NVIDIA, many analysts say"
"4788820","4789240"," they're behind."
"4789640","4790580"," Here's what Benioff says."
"4792160","4793380"," RAI is very different. "
"4793960","4796260"," RAI is working inside your company."
"4796260","4801740"," We're not just a general language model operating on the side."
"4802020","4806700"," We're really working to ground the AI, which is kind of a technical term. "
"4806900","4813160"," It's called grounding, where you're grounding the AI into your data so that it can learn about your"
"4813160","4813480"," company."
"4814000","4818500"," We've been doing that for a decade, and that's why we're going to do, as I mentioned, a trillion"
"4818500","4823580"," predictive and generative transactions this week."
"4823840","4824600"," That's pretty awesome. "
"4824600","4828240"," By the way, that's far more than any other enterprise vendor."
"4828820","4831300"," I don't know who's giving us what credit."
"4831600","4832680"," I'm not looking for credit. "
"4832940","4834800"," I just know that my customers love this."
"4835680","4840040"," He went through a number of customers and how he interacts with them as well."
"4840440","4847060"," Everyone from Laura Pianna to Gucci to Ford to GM about how they're incorporating this AI, the data"
"4847060","4850860"," that they've been able to collect and the AI into customer experiences. "
"4851220","4852820"," That was from our leaders special last night."
"4852820","4858000"," Tonight, we've got a new one, CNBC leaders, World Bank President, Ajay Banga, APM Eastern."
"4858240","4861900"," He has not really spoken since he's been on the job a little more than six months. "
"4862100","4864040"," He's got a pretty big remit."
"4864060","4865800"," It's very different from the way we know him."
"4865880","4870840"," He led MasterCard, of course, for many, many years, very successfully, I would say, according to"
"4870840","4871340"," shareholders. "
"4872040","4875800"," Now, he's in charge of fighting global poverty and climate change."
"4876940","4878160"," A little bit of a difference."
"4878200","4878560"," A little different. "
"4879160","4885980"," But it was interesting to hear how he's bringing his private sector chops to try to fix and improve"
"4885980","4889020"," a bureaucratic organization like the World Bank."
"4890000","4895000"," Meantime, as we mentioned, Tesla is going to report tonight after the bell off to a rough start for"
"4895000","4895980"," the year so far."
"4896280","4898660"," Our filibuster is here to talk about what we might expect. "
"4898880","4902080"," Some key areas that the streets looking for some clarity on Phil."
"4903420","4908220"," The one number that everybody's going to be focused on, Carl, we talk about it every quarter, gross"
"4908220","4911600"," auto margins, excluding zero emission vehicle credits."
"4911600","4915880"," That number has been coming down at a pretty steady clip over the last couple of years. "
"4916120","4921800"," Looked at the estimate for the fourth quarter, 15.7%. Back in the first quarter, it was up at 19%."
"4921800","4924780"," Hey, a couple of years ago, I remember one is well north of 20%."
"4924780","4927180"," And the reason is because of what's happening in China. "
"4927580","4929200"," It is the world's largest EV market."
"4929560","4931760"," It's a huge market for Tesla, understandably."
"4932280","4933800"," They've got the giga factory in Shanghai. "
"4934420","4938040"," The pricing pressure there has been immense and it has not led up."
"4938220","4940720"," We saw price cuts from Tesla in the fourth quarter."
"4940720","4944060"," That will have a direct impact on those gross auto margins. "
"4944380","4948700"," In terms of deliveries, the street wants to know if they're going to give us guidance for 2024."
"4949180","4953200"," Remember, Tesla delivered just over 1.8 million vehicles last year."
"4953860","4959920"," The consensus right now going into the call today is 2.1 million is what they're expecting Tesla to"
"4959920","4960660"," give for a guidance. "
"4960840","4964960"," We'll see if they give us actual guidance or if we get something a little more vague like, well,"
"4965240","4966960"," we're going to be up, I don't know, 15, 20%."
"4966960","4969820"," We'll see during the call after the numbers when they come out."
"4969820","4975460"," As you take a look at shares of Tesla, remember, the conference call with Elon Musk is at 5.30"
"4975460","4976080"," this afternoon. "
"4976500","4980900"," And that's really, guys, when you start to see shares of Tesla move, depending on what he says"
"4980900","4981600"," during that call."
"4982220","4987280"," And again, gross auto margins, excluding zero-emission vehicle credits, that's the number people"
"4987280","4988080"," will be focused on."
"4988980","4995180"," Meanwhile, Phil, there's some discussion about delivery guidance for the year and some asymmetry"
"4995180","4997500"," between sell side and buy side options. "
"5000240","5001200"," Yeah, absolutely."
"5001620","5005760"," And I think, you know, you've heard more than a few people who have said originally, we think that"
"5005760","5010860"," they're going to be delivering maybe 2.2, 2.3 million vehicles this year."
"5011400","5011960"," That's gone. "
"5012200","5014420"," You rarely hear anybody talking about that."
"5014680","5018240"," And you don't hear anybody saying, well, maybe they'll just do a little over 2 million."
"5018580","5021460"," That 2.1 is really where everybody's coming together. "
"5021720","5027940"," And we've already seen that in terms of the expectations for production coming down a little bit,"
"5028160","5031540"," especially what we know what's happening with the Gigafactory in Berlin."
"5032280","5038400"," And we know that in China, while it is the largest Tesla factory, that's a market that's under a"
"5038400","5040100"," lot of pressure right now, not just for Tesla."
"5040520","5040600"," Right. "
"5040860","5042540"," That's going to be an investigation or legislation."
"5042880","5048000"," Sorry, so we wanted to go to Dave Calhoun on Capitol Hill, another obviously situation you've been"
"5048000","5052080"," covering closely with Boeing, but I believe he just ran away from the cameras or walked away."
"5054640","5060180"," We'll be following, of course, that hearing with Calhoun and give you any updates along the way. "
"5060260","5063040"," Our live market coverage, of course, continues right at this."
"5241560","5242540"," Good Wednesday morning."
"5242740","5243360"," Welcome to Money Boobers. "
"5243540","5244060"," I'm Carl Keaton."
"5244140","5247040"," Here with Sarah Eyes and Live at Post 9 of the New York Stock Exchange."
"5247540","5252800"," Today, investors add to some Netflix games as the company continues to add subs, crack down our"
"5252800","5253460"," password sharing. "
"5254020","5258040"," Talk about the read-through for what those results tell us about the rest of Big Tech, including"
"5258040","5258860"," Microsoft inability."
"5259500","5261660"," Then, well, Netflix doesn't want you to share."
"5262000","5267480"," Etsy is hoping you're feeling generous, launching a new AI gifting platform and announcing its"
"5267480","5270360"," first ever Super Bowl ad and exclusive with the CEO, this hour. "
"5270740","5275700"," Rock solid court, a lot of free court today, surging as copper prices get to a three-week high."
"5276160","5281640"," CEO is going to join us on the back of results and talk about Tesla with a three-tringer bull"
"5281640","5287900"," cluster and a successful back test on the one minute, five minutes and hourly trigger."
"5288400","5296840"," We also have a turnaround on the hourly trigger to a bush upside price target. "
"5304110","5305910"," 227, 67."
"5315220","5320280"," And two percent and yields are backing off a little bit, perhaps a little helpful after we've seen"
"5320280","5322060"," a little bit of a creep higher in recent days."
"5322520","5325520"," Topping the tape for us today, investors, are they getting ahead of themselves?"
"5326040","5330860"," Despite some strong headline numbers, softer guidance has showed up in nearly every sector from"
"5330860","5333100"," defense to industrials, semis, healthcare. "
"5333960","5335880"," Is this the sign that the pullback could be coming?"
"5336240","5340060"," Let's bring in CNBC senior markets commentator Mike Santoli."
"5340360","5341720"," What are you getting from the guidance, Mike?"
"5342280","5347540"," Yeah, Sarah, it definitely seems as if there's some softness or some conservatism in a lot of the"
"5347540","5347780"," guidance."
"5348400","5352700"," That being said, a lot of times, earnings season is more to be survived than to be celebrated. "
"5352700","5356700"," We're going to probably track toward a decent beat rate in aggregate."
"5357280","5361660"," It seems if the market is willing to lean on this macro cushion that we built up."
"5361800","5365880"," By that, I mean, you've had months and months of accumulating evidence of inflation's going the"
"5365880","5366400"," right way. "
"5366940","5368900"," The growth seems more resilient than we thought."
"5369060","5374080"," We just got the S&P, the PMI numbers that look pretty good in here."
"5374280","5375520"," So you're in a bit of a sweet spot. "
"5375660","5377060"," The market's taking advantage of that."
"5377360","5379460"," I think much more about the internal market dynamics."
"5379460","5385180"," I want to step in here and read some of the chat questions here for you. "
"5385320","5387140"," I want to have questions for the chat right now."
"5387200","5388600"," I'm reading through some of this chat right here."
"5389220","5394180"," As a matter of fact, I just got the phone with us on the phone with e-trading shorts just"
"5394180","5394920"," a moment ago. "
"5396280","5397880"," And we were discussing."
"5399980","5408320"," We were discussing which trades people take with me and not take with me."
"5412060","5414700"," So we want to discuss this right now. "
"5414940","5417440"," So I don't know how to word this."
"5419880","5422400"," You know, oftentimes inside of our stream."
"5423000","5425140"," Matter of fact, e-trading shorts that we're talking about. "
"5427580","5433820"," We've been trying to focus more on like oftentimes we'll do a trader log, right?"
"5435380","5438000"," And a lot of people DM me."
"5438060","5440200"," I'll meet with these people and I'll say, hey, what's going on with you?"
"5440300","5441540"," What's going on with you?"
"5441580","5443220"," Let's check our trade history, right?"
"5444320","5447460"," And they'll say something to me like, I blew up my account on zero dates."
"5447940","5448840"," So that's cool. "
"5450420","5452400"," So we find out what's going on, right?"
"5452840","5454260"," You just blew up your account on zero dates."
"5454660","5455920"," What do I find, right?"
"5457000","5460480"," Well, Cap, I followed you on this one zero date trade."
"5462320","5462720"," Okay. "
"5463780","5464540"," Did you do well?"
"5464700","5465180"," Yeah, I made money."
"5465840","5466600"," Did you do?"
"5467200","5469660"," I followed you on the second zero date trade, made money."
"5469900","5470320"," Okay, great. "
"5470860","5471360"," What did you do?"
"5471600","5472520"," I doubled down, Cap."
"5473420","5475080"," How much of your account is this?"
"5475400","5476000"," All of it, Cap."
"5477560","5479480"," So first problem is all of it. "
"5479760","5481180"," Second problem is doubling down."
"5483200","5486740"," Then you say something like, did you hedge the market with some puts?"
"5487220","5487320"," No."
"5487820","5488660"," Did you trade it up?"
"5489340","5492280"," Matter of fact, we can go back to Friday's stream, I think. "
"5493320","5498140"," And we talked about putting on a put spread for the 31st, right?"
"5498760","5500520"," With a target date of the 31st."
"5501100","5503280"," And trade the market up as it goes up."
"5504560","5508840"," So the question becomes, did you trade the market up with the put spread on?"
"5509220","5509660"," No. "
"5510660","5511660"," Did you short meta?"
"5512500","5512520"," No."
"5513660","5515460"," Did you take the Tesla trade long?"
"5516300","5517440"," No, right?"
"5517440","5518060"," Okay."
"5518140","5518820"," So what did you do?"
"5519140","5521540"," Well, I took what I liked, right?"
"5521760","5529700"," So the idea here is that you take one trade out of my 10 trades or my 20 trades, you"
"5529700","5534580"," take one of those, or you might take the ones that you may like, right?"
"5534800","5537160"," Like, I want to just take de-gen zero date trades. "
"5538180","5541060"," And I want to double down, and it's going to be 100% of my account."
"5541400","5546780"," So there's no real comparison to what I do, right?"
"5546780","5548500"," Do you buying the underlying?"
"5549160","5550620"," Do you own something else?"
"5550840","5551720"," Do you own anything in the marketplace?"
"5552240","5558020"," So you're buying call spreads in size six to 10 times a year, likely not."
"5559080","5561520"," Are you taking your winnings when you have a hit?"
"5561940","5565760"," See, you take it because they're in a trade and you make 300% or 1000%. "
"5565760","5570920"," Are you taking that money out of the market and starting again from that 100% that you originally"
"5570920","5571860"," started with, right?"
"5572140","5573220"," The answer is usually no."
"5573860","5580060"," So when you ask those questions of yourself, the answer is likely no."
"5581120","5581900"," Makes sense?"
"5584540","5586660"," I'm reading through some of these comments right now. "
"5589620","5592400"," So you've got to kind of consider that stuff as well, right?"
"5593540","5597740"," As a matter of fact, I'm green this week and I haven't traded any zero dates."
"5598360","5600560"," I'm still green this week right now."
"5600560","5608320"," So if you were to actually follow my trades, you would be green this week without trading any zero"
"5608320","5608780"," dates. "
"5609200","5614120"," As a matter of fact, as I closed on Friday, Meta did very well."
"5614480","5615460"," Did pretty well."
"5616660","5619080"," Tesla did outstanding one day. "
"5619400","5621360"," Now I'm hoping for it to come back, right?"
"5622200","5627340"," My puts are getting torched, but I'm still green on the week, which is good."
"5627340","5632860"," And I haven't got to trade any zero dates and too busy in the background to trade this market up,"
"5633240","5634460"," which I'm pissed off about."
"5635060","5642700"," So just be careful with what, like, or I would say be careful with, I'd be careful with comparison"
"5642700","5646060"," or comparing your trades to my trades. "
"5646700","5654880"," And oftentimes a lot of our viewers don't follow me unless they want to follow specific things,"
"5655180","5655280"," right?"
"5655280","5657140"," I'm only going to follow this one aspect."
"5658360","5660760"," I'm not going to put a ratio spread on."
"5660900","5662360"," I'm not going to put this. "
"5662740","5664740"," As a matter of fact, this is the funniest part."
"5664960","5669220"," The trade that I set up on Friday was not straight puts."
"5669540","5670940"," It was a put spread, right?"
"5671820","5676000"," And I think the date on that put spread wasn't even in January. "
"5676640","5676860"," Was it?"
"5677920","5684320"," I believe it was a, I think I've dated that spread for, I'll feel back and watch the stream."
"5684540","5687720"," But I think that that spread was a force set."
"5688140","5689180"," Don't I get this wrong?"
"5689440","5690000"," I could have this wrong. "
"5690140","5698480"," But I think it was a 490 to 475 put spread that expires in April."
"5698680","5699360"," I could be wrong on that."
"5699460","5701640"," I'll go back and look at that Friday put spread. "
"5702020","5703920"," So let me know if I'm wrong on that."
"5704020","5705520"," But I think that's what it was dated for."
"5707440","5711680"," So you shouldn't be getting torched right now in any way anyways. "
"5712920","5713620"," Pass face."
"5713740","5718720"," I haven't had a chance to set that interview up yet with him, but we will."
"5719120","5720240"," I don't have any time right now. "
"5721580","5723940"," As a matter of fact, I don't know who it was."
"5723980","5729520"," Someone mentioned the draw sideways and down into the 31st."
"5730780","5734960"," That trade that we set up for you was a put spread on options profit calculator, right?"
"5738940","5740480"," You guys remember the trade, right?"
"5740660","5740940"," From Friday?"
"5741480","5743180"," I'll get Frankie to post it for you if you want. "
"5743180","5746260"," The exact time we've set that trade up with you, but."
"5746800","5750820"," I believe it was it's I believe it was like one o'clock in the afternoon on Friday or something"
"5750820","5751180"," like that."
"5751260","5754820"," I can't remember exactly, but it was like one o'clock in the afternoon Friday. "
"5755120","5757700"," It was a put spread for 490 475."
"5758960","5759900"," And I don't forget."
"5760080","5762880"," I forget the exact expiry on that one, but. "
"5763700","5765680"," That should still print at this point."
"5765680","5767100"," It was my point."
"5775660","5778760"," So I did, but so I didn't actually take that trade. "
"5779500","5781400"," I take puts on the clothes."
"5782280","5787240"," On Friday instead, but the trade that I set up was not that trade."
"5791020","5792100"," So anyways. "
"5794120","5795480"," What else we got going on here?"
"5797760","5798340"," Let me read the."
"5798960","5799460"," Oh shit."
"5811770","5812710"," Thanks Conner. "
"5812790","5813370"," I appreciate it, man."
"5815170","5815870"," Appreciate it brother."
"5821720","5823420"," It was weird to he went back. "
"5824660","5825740"," Back in here."
"5835040","5835840"," Members only."
"5838180","5840860"," The chat has to be not top chat, but. "
"5841540","5843680"," Most recent YouTube."
"5845200","5846100"," Notice that."
"5849900","5851060"," Members only mode. "
"5852500","5853360"," Yeah, I'll pull."
"5853520","5854980"," I should pull some of this stuff up."
"5855140","5858240"," So I guess that all this leads into the conversation of. "
"5858740","5861580"," Be wary of anyone."
"5862980","5864800"," That anyone that's."
"5865700","5867300"," Comparing notes, because what I."
"5867540","5870000"," Normally what happens is I find out that they're not. "
"5870200","5871980"," They're not actually following my trades."
"5872580","5877460"," This isn't a derogatory statement towards whoever said that earlier, either."
"5877540","5878120"," It's that. "
"5879580","5882480"," When we do a trade log, you find out that."
"5883420","5885120"," People are not trading what you're trading."
"5885260","5886600"," They're not trading the same account size. "
"5887260","5891280"," They're not percentage wise, like a trade 3% of your count 5% 10%."
"5891280","5894660"," They're not removing money from the market when they do win."
"5895240","5898020"," We should go over that sometime too, because when you're a count building. "
"5898800","5902380"," You can't account bill doing just zero dates if you wanted."
"5902880","5906080"," Week in week out until you actually grow an account, but once you do."
"5906740","5911900"," You still again have to remove that money from the market and you start from square one again. "
"5912800","5913760"," We could talk about that."
"5913940","5915240"," We've used to talk about that more frequently."
"5915240","5916560"," We don't talk about it as much anymore. "
"5917720","5920360"," But the ultimate thing here is that."
"5920720","5925960"," I was talking to E train trucks just earlier and I was like, you know, we've been discussing."
"5926620","5930780"," Not even talking about my trades any longer on stream. "
"5931260","5935700"," And spending more time with you on what you're trading."
"5936540","5938260"," What your history is."
"5939320","5940680"," To find out what. "
"5941420","5943480"," You may or may not be doing right or wrong."
"5951680","5952720"," Yeah, it's hard."
"5952760","5953540"," It's hard to say. "
"5953680","5955780"," It's hard to look at your."
"5957000","5959420"," Trading history, unless it's an individual basis."
"5960520","5962160"," You know, because we talked. "
"5962480","5964020"," We were we mentor people and everyone."
"5964020","5964520"," We mentor."
"5964720","5966760"," We find this very similar things. "
"5968800","5971820"," Amongst a lot of people that are consistently losing in the market."
"5973220","5976440"," And it's not shocking, but it's not what you'd expect."
"5977960","5978900"," Are you hedged?"
"5979100","5979220"," No. "
"5979500","5981380"," Are you buying underlying stocks on lows?"
"5981680","5981800"," No."
"5982540","5983240"," Are you buying tops?"
"5983600","5983680"," Yes."
"5984540","5987300"," You're doubling down, tripling down quadrupling down. "
"5987500","5991980"," I mean, like, I don't know, I traded a thousand bucks and I made, I made a banger."
"5992100","5993420"," I made 5,000 percent."
"5993780","5994180"," Okay. "
"5994300","5994780"," So what'd you do with that?"
"5995000","5995780"," Five thousand dollars."
"5995960","5996520"," Oh, I fucking."
"5996860","6000880"," My favorite line is I started trading with a bigger size. "
"6001800","6005420"," I'm like, you didn't take that money and remove it from the market and start back at a thousand"
"6005420","6005680"," again."
"6005680","6008200"," At least give yourself five more chances to hit it again."
"6008660","6009760"," No, I just doubled down. "
"6010360","6012640"," That's a common thing amongst people."
"6013120","6016640"," Then you ask them things like, here's a great one."
"6016840","6017300"," Here's a great one. "
"6018180","6023620"," So Joe Donut here follows me on call spreads on capitulations."
"6025340","6027040"," And I go with size on these trades."
"6027900","6032140"," I put spreads and call spreads size 20,000, 30,000. "
"6033420","6037140"," Roughly that usually, sometimes higher, 50, 60,000 dollars."
"6040320","6048760"," Oftentimes when I'm closing those spreads, our chat is no joke."
"6049940","6050700"," Dead silent. "
"6052640","6055000"," And I was just talking to each trading shorts."
"6055040","6056280"," He's a moderator in Discord."
"6057400","6062100"," And that tells me that it's not a glamorous trade, right?"
"6064160","6068220"," It tells me that it's not fancy or it's not the glory trade. "
"6068520","6073240"," You don't look at it, but you monitor it, but it's not the trade that's like paying in the next"
"6073240","6073860"," five minutes."
"6075100","6079560"," Another thing that happens in this stream is because we're live streaming all day long."
"6079560","6084820"," We talked about this recently though, but when we are here all day long, Monday through Friday,"
"6085680","6089280"," people have jobs, they have commitments, they've got kids, they've got whatever they got going on"
"6089280","6094660"," their life, or they're just making a trade and they stop in to get a pulse, right?"
"6094920","6096800"," Like, hey, I'm about to take a long here. "
"6097620","6098980"," I'm feeling pretty bullish."
"6099180","6099820"," Why are you feeling captain?"
"6100060","6101260"," Hey, I'm feeling bullish too, right?"
"6101740","6110700"," So you might be here all week long, 932, 4, and you might not, that person that might not, might"
"6110700","6112220"," be taking that one trade, you know?"
"6112420","6118340"," So you might be, you're hearing noise, right, where you might hear 10 people or 100 people getting"
"6118340","6122360"," long all day long, but they're different people cycling in and out throughout the week."
"6123220","6125500"," You don't know what their trading plan is either. "
"6125620","6129860"," You don't know if they've just made a bunch of money and just won five trades, three trades, 10"
"6129860","6137280"," trades, and you're maybe stopping in at that one moment and trying to gamble 1,000 bucks or 5,000"
"6137280","6138280"," bucks to try to hit it big."
"6139140","6146000"," So there's a lot of variables that are not related to what you are doing."
"6146640","6154860"," So if you are losing right now as a trader, if you're losing as a trader by trying to follow"
"6154860","6159660"," me on one trade or one portion of what I'm doing, I'm going to recommend that you don't do that. "
"6160220","6162040"," You should have your own trading plan."
"6162760","6163860"," You should have a system."
"6164060","6165420"," We talk about this all the time. "
"6167060","6169100"," You know how I make my money."
"6169420","6170760"," You know that I buy the market."
"6170760","6176660"," You know that I buy spreads on capitulation and very oversold moments in the market. "
"6176960","6178620"," You know that I fund myself with that."
"6178700","6180080"," You know that I buy properties with that."
"6180140","6181660"," You know that I take care of my family that way. "
"6181780","6183540"," I de-gen gamble with that kind of stuff."
"6184260","6187220"," And I actually make great money de-gen gambling too."
"6187940","6190980"," But when I blow up an account or something, I'm making money in other places. "
"6191520","6193800"," There are guys out there that sell premium."
"6194500","6199860"," There are people out there that do ladder spreads."
"6199860","6202720"," They do calendar spreads, all this other stuff that's not as glamorous. "
"6203740","6210460"," They're trading selling condors or selling butterflies and stuff like that."
"6211620","6215560"," So you don't know what everybody else is trading or you're choosing not to trade what everybody"
"6215560","6216720"," else is trading as a whole."
"6217500","6222040"," So if you are losing a lot, as my point here is that you should probably stop trading. "
"6223280","6227920"," And try to come up with a plan that guarantees you income every week."
"6227920","6229280"," That's the ultimate goal, right?"
"6229500","6231740"," You're not going to get that from zero dates."
"6232940","6239300"," If your trading plan is where a trend day, that doesn't fly over time. "
"6239300","6239980"," It doesn't fly."
"6242340","6246700"," Or I'm here for trend day and I'm going to double down my account."
"6246960","6248320"," It's not just one piece. "
"6248520","6250920"," It's usually like two or three things that are going on."
"6251720","6255100"," Like I'm doubling down and I'm not removing money from the market."
"6255820","6261980"," As a matter of fact, we had a guy in here a year ago, and I think it was a"
"6261980","6262320"," year ago. "
"6262460","6265180"," He was shorting the market in a big way."
"6265240","6270900"," I think he lost $600,000 or something and I talked to him privately and I was like, you know,"
"6270900","6271800"," I can't give you any advice."
"6271840","6273380"," First of all, I'm not a financial advisor. "
"6273940","6280740"," Second of all, if I advised you and said, stop fucking trading and the market actually went down"
"6280740","6283280"," and you could have won your million dollars back or something."
"6283280","6285420"," You'd hate me, be angry at me, right?"
"6286420","6290920"," That ultimately comes back to you being responsible for your investment decisions, your trading"
"6290920","6291400"," decisions."
"6292440","6293720"," I think he ended up losing even more. "
"6293880","6295780"," He ended up losing close to a million dollars or something."
"6296880","6299600"," You know, had he stopped trading, he wouldn't have lost all that money."
"6300160","6301500"," But I can't give that advice to somebody. "
"6302660","6305900"," You know, they're going to do what they're going to do and they have to ultimately live with their"
"6305900","6308440"," choices and look at."
"6309780","6312040"," All right, we'll talk about that too."
"6312200","6313520"," So best advice for growing account. "
"6313780","6314720"," We've talked about this in the past."
"6314940","6318980"," We actually, they're guys like John L in the discord."
"6319140","6321080"," He loves to give information on this. "
"6321320","6324360"," He trains shorts, bunch of other guys that will."
"6326900","6331220"," Put your training style in our microscope and make you a winning trader with proof, right?"
"6333020","6336640"," But if you're going to grow an account, there's basically two ways to do it."
"6336640","6340200"," Or in my view, there's two ways to do it at least. "
"6341700","6343100"," One, keep it simple."
"6344060","6345200"," Definitely keep it simple."
"6346840","6352240"," You want like sure thing trades over trading is a big problem for a lot of people. "
"6353060","6357160"," If you try to grow an account, you should be probably taking anywhere from five to ten trades a"
"6357160","6357760"," year at max."
"6359000","6361020"," To grow an account on sure things."
"6362620","6363800"," So that's the safe way to do it. "
"6363800","6369040"," That's either by buying the market or investing your money and using that money."
"6369200","6370360"," Let's start from somewhere else."
"6370700","6371980"," So if I had a million dollars. "
"6372700","6374100"," So this is going back to that person."
"6374840","6377960"," If I had a million dollars, this guy had a million bucks, a million dollars."
"6378820","6379440"," True story. "
"6381780","6384520"," You would never trade that in the stock market in any way, shape"
"6384520","6393780"," or form."
"6393780","6395280"," If you're selling off of it from a money market account."
"6397520","6400180"," Or from dividends from owning the spy. "
"6401420","6402380"," The S&P 500."
"6403140","6405040"," I shouldn't say spy, but just owning the S&P 500."
"6407560","6408320"," Selling premium. "
"6409460","6412460"," There are owning property with that million dollars."
"6412920","6416580"," There are million, not a million, but there's a few million dollars."
"6416840","6421900"," If you have the money, it is easy for you to. "
"6422980","6425020"," Maintain that million dollars at minimum."
"6425560","6426800"," Beat inflation."
"6428120","6429680"," Generally speaking, beat inflation. "
"6430180","6431740"," So that month million never goes away."
"6432040","6433780"," And you're just quote unquote gambling."
"6434060","6436440"," Even if you're selling prop premium buying the market. "
"6436820","6439240"," And buying a fucking share of Tesla."
"6440580","6444380"," Should come out of that money, that extra money that you're making for that million bucks."
"6445040","6445160"," Right. "
"6445500","6446100"," Does that make sense?"
"6446900","6449960"," And if you hit it, you take that money out of the market."
"6449960","6455140"," Or you build yourself, you build yourself an account over time."
"6455700","6458340"," And you're always trading that money. "
"6459520","6462420"," If after building that account, you start to make some real profit."
"6462740","6465400"," You still remove that fucking money from the stock market."
"6465860","6469640"," And put it somewhere else that you can generate pretty much guaranteed money. "
"6470660","6474640"," Over time to invest in the stock market."
"6474780","6475980"," So that's the guy that's got a million bucks."
"6475980","6480040"," Now, I know most, not most, but a lot of you out there don't have that money. "
"6481180","6485080"," You might be coming into the marketplace with a thousand dollars or $5,000."
"6485700","6488900"," 10 or 20 or $25,000."
"6489400","6490960"," Or even 50, still small account. "
"6491340","6495920"," So if you're a small account person, to me, that's not a lot of money."
"6496280","6499140"," I can blow 10 grand in a day, 15 grand in a week, easy."
"6501320","6502020"," Outside of the market. "
"6502800","6505800"," Especially these days, $1,000 is nothing."
"6506660","6507600"," It's not shit."
"6508120","6511600"," $1,000 is nothing, $5 grand is nothing, $10 grand is nothing. "
"6511960","6513240"," If you think that's a lot of money, it's nothing."
"6514700","6517120"," So let's say you're just building an account."
"6518600","6521580"," I would start you off with a savings account. "
"6522300","6523900"," You shouldn't even be trading the market."
"6524360","6530300"," The first thing you should be doing is starting some form of a savings account that could"
"6530300","6532720"," eventually grow to having a money market account."
"6533900","6536160"," The next thing you should be doing is paper trading. "
"6536720","6542640"," Whether that's investing and then moving on to options and then more complex options so that you"
"6542640","6543960"," can learn the mechanics of a trade."
"6545560","6548160"," Okay, that's like step number two is just paper trading."
"6549560","6553200"," Becoming comfortable with the mechanics of trading. "
"6553260","6559220"," Whether that's buying stock, whether that's selling stock, shorting stock, trading futures, I don't"
"6559220","6560880"," care whatever you want to do, but learn it all."
"6561440","6567900"," Learn how to do simple spreads, complex spreads, that kind of stuff with no money."
"6568220","6572480"," That's like step two while you're building your bank accounts, your savings accounts, while you're"
"6572480","6576200"," building a money market account, that kind of stuff. "
"6577880","6579300"," And growing that account in the background."
"6580240","6582040"," Now let's say you got that thousand bucks."
"6582740","6584140"," This is the safe way, by the way. "
"6584960","6588500"," And over time you start getting, you know, a thousand bucks, five thousand dollars and your savings"
"6588500","6591260"," account a few weeks past three months, six months of past."
"6592180","6596260"," You've now accumulated five grand, three months of past, you're probably a thousand bucks a week."
"6597100","6598020"," What is that, right?"
"6600120","6603920"," Four, twelve, sixteen thousand dollars you're starting with, right?"
"6605500","6611840"," And then you have to make a decision on how to take a trade that has a high percentage win"
"6611840","6613500"," rate, right?"
"6613500","6614920"," High percentage win rate. "
"6615440","6623700"," Those trades only come once a month, once every three months, something like that, where you're"
"6623700","6627400"," selling huge peaks in the market or huge lows in the market."
"6627940","6634380"," You're either selling, or you're selling puts or calls, or you're actually grabbing a put spread or"
"6634380","6637760"," a call spread, I don't care, or even a ratio spread."
"6638080","6639480"," Like ratio spreads are no brainers. "
"6640780","6646360"," They basically pay, you can't lose money if you go flat, but on a volatile market like Spy or Q's"
"6646360","6649880"," or something like that, they're pretty easy trades to take where you're not going to get blown up."
"6650240","6653140"," Another easy trade to when you first start trading is just buying stock."
"6655100","6657180"," They make jokes about this too, right?"
"6657660","6664200"," You're not going to realize losses until that stock goes to zero, but truly buying a stock and"
"6664200","6667020"," holding it to grow that small account, that thousand dollar account. "
"6667020","6668420"," It's pretty fucking safe."
"6669300","6673440"," If you're upside down, there's a good chance it's going to come back at worst one, two, three"
"6673440","6675340"," years, maybe back in the green again."
"6675800","6681420"," As a matter of fact, a lot of stocks, specifically the SP 500, is back to its highs from 2022. "
"6683160","6689300"," If you had just bought the spoos leading into January of 2022, and you were upside down for all of"
"6689300","6691480"," last year, you'd be back to flat today."
"6692140","6693320"," That's pretty risk-free."
"6693320","6697700"," If you look at spoos over time, it's pretty risk-free. "
"6697980","6702840"," Even if you time it wrong, if you bought the fucking top, it would still come back and you'd be"
"6702840","6703620"," back to flat again."
"6703880","6706600"," That's pretty risk-less over time."
"6706900","6713740"," And you're collecting the dividends over that course of that year off of that ticker. "
"6714840","6715880"," Does that make sense to you guys?"
"6716040","6717560"," That's a pretty safe way to do things."
"6718840","6725320"," We actually give you every safe trade that I trade from start to finish here."
"6725680","6731400"," When I enter a call spread, we give it, we plot it out for you, we show you the strikes,"
"6731760","6733800"," we show you how to execute it, everything to start to finish. "
"6735140","6739680"," So anyways, that would be a safe way to trade the market in my view, especially a new trader."
"6740580","6745260"," Like a debit call spread is a fairly simple trade to execute."
"6746140","6749560"," To open and to close, to grasp and comprehend. "
"6751100","6757380"," And you can easily see in the marketplace when we're at extreme oversold conditions."
"6758160","6763320"," Because when we get to oversold conditions, we have a liquidation phase."
"6764380","6766160"," And you can actually see it in the marketplace. "
"6766540","6770320"," You can see it in each sector that they start to liquidate all at the same time."
"6771180","6772940"," So it's clear as day."
"6773600","6775820"," Matter of fact, we talk about Dan Niles. "
"6777100","6779300"," Dan Niles has a fund I believe in New Mexico."
"6779760","6786460"," He comes right out and says we're super bearish here, but we longed the market here because it's so"
"6786460","6786900"," oversold."
"6787060","6788080"," We can't sell anymore. "
"6789280","6790920"," There's no more selling that can be done here."
"6792140","6794320"," So that would be like step number two if you're trying to do it safely."
"6796820","6799460"," Now, that's step number two. "
"6799460","6802220"," So now you're building an account, right?"
"6803300","6807620"," You're only taking maybe six to 10 trades to build your account."
"6808220","6812100"," Your account likely needs to be somewhere around $25,000 to $50,000."
"6812600","6815280"," 50 is pretty much where I would like you to be. "
"6815800","6817360"," You should have about $50,000."
"6817660","6820840"," So you're not constantly slipping back into PETs and stuff like that."
"6823100","6826880"," Now, if you want to, you should stick doing those trades. "
"6826880","6829700"," You don't change that part of your system, right?"
"6830400","6833560"," You're still making those trades with size and conviction."
"6834600","6836780"," Now, let's say I take a call spread."
"6837320","6838680"," Let's say I take $25,000. "
"6838780","6842420"," I say I have $50,000 in my account to place a $25,000 call spread."
"6843280","6843800"," I'm conservative."
"6844180","6846560"," I put three months on it instead of one, right?"
"6846840","6848480"," Just in case there's one more leg down. "
"6848960","6853320"," Even though we still roll back up, I'm only looking to make another $25,000."
"6854140","6859400"," And let's say I place the trade cost me $25,000."
"6860020","6861700"," The trade pays $50,000. "
"6862200","6865180"," I exit the trade at $25,000 in profit."
"6865720","6867420"," I don't actually hold it the entire time."
"6867500","6872560"," But just to about the 50% mark, because there's some time decay, usually not always, but usually"
"6872560","6875860"," built into the end of that trade, especially if it's like a three month trade. "
"6877000","6878760"," So I'll take it out at 50%, right?"
"6879340","6881700"," So I just traded $25,000."
"6881700","6885080"," I just made $25,000, right?"
"6885260","6885920"," So now I'm up 50."
"6886260","6887920"," Now my account is now 75 grand. "
"6888960","6893800"," A huge thing here would be, okay, fuck yeah, I'm a rock star trader."
"6894560","6896600"," I'm going to go de-gen trade some Tesla."
"6896960","6898080"," I'm going to go de-gen trade. "
"6898440","6899260"," I don't fucking know."
"6899400","6899840"," You pick it."
"6900460","6900900"," GME. "
"6901460","6902300"," I'm going to de-gen."
"6902560","6903540"," I'm getting all beard up."
"6903680","6905080"," I'm going to start shorting the fucking market. "
"6905920","6907100"," Like all kinds of insane shit."
"6907180","6909420"," I'm going to start buying zero dates."
"6909420","6913860"," And what's crazy is, you're like, what did you trade zero dates with?"
"6914060","6914920"," Well, I sized up. "
"6915000","6915520"," I'm a good trader."
"6915820","6916900"," Now I got 75k."
"6917440","6922180"," I'm buying a 5 or 10k in zero dates on a weekly basis. "
"6922560","6923320"," I'm like, wait a minute here."
"6923920","6925060"," You just opened an account."
"6925920","6928340"," You just funded an account basically to 50k. "
"6929140","6931500"," You're at the start of an account."
"6931920","6934900"," That's a start, 50k, right?"
"6935160","6938340"," You just made $25,000 on that baseline."
"6938340","6938880"," Right?"
"6939680","6942560"," So you're actually only up 25,000. "
"6942700","6943380"," You're not up 75."
"6944180","6948200"," That 25 and that 50 is you're getting started with that."
"6948820","6949060"," Right?"
"6949620","6954520"," So now you've got $25,000 of real money in your account. "
"6956120","6958860"," You want to place that spread trade again, right?"
"6960340","6963760"," You can't be out DJing stuff."
"6963880","6966440"," You literally have to wait one entire cycle."
"6967300","6973640"," Until you have an opportunity to place that second, go to that next call spread trade. "
"6974100","6978040"," So now I'm up to $100,000 trading safely."
"6979040","6983280"," So I got my 25 buy-in to get out of PDT."
"6983680","6991500"," I got my 25 buy-in to keep me slipping back into PDTs if a trade is slightly going against"
"6991500","6992020"," me or whatever. "
"6992560","6994460"," So that 50 is basically gone."
"6994460","6995900"," Even though it's there, it's gone."
"6996560","6998340"," So I'm sitting on 25,000, right?"
"6998460","7004120"," So I place another near guaranteed winner and I make another 25k. "
"7004220","7006880"," So now I got a 100k in my account."
"7007660","7007780"," Right?"
"7008200","7010580"," So now I want to start doing some DJing shit, right?"
"7011380","7014600"," And I now have my 25 for my PDT."
"7015640","7017680"," I got 25,000 to keep me out of PDT. "
"7018620","7022460"," And then I've got 25,000 to play with."
"7022460","7024120"," 25k that I have, yeah."
"7024300","7031540"," No, I've got 25,000 to continue to trade to make regular consistent money and call spreads, right?"
"7032120","7036340"," So I've got 25 separated just for call spreads for me personally, at least. "
"7036940","7037220"," Right?"
"7037360","7038720"," So that's 25, 25, 25."
"7038860","7039540"," It's $75,000."
"7040120","7042300"," And I now have the 25 that I made. "
"7042460","7042860"," I'm in a 100."
"7043240","7048120"," I really have in my account at that point only $25,000."
"7049020","7050040"," And I'm a new trader. "
"7051720","7052240"," Right?"
"7052400","7052780"," I got 75."
"7053220","7053820"," I can't touch."
"7054380","7057080"," Because I've got 25 going towards my regular thing. "
"7057640","7059760"," I got 50 to keep me out of PDTs."
"7060340","7062380"," I now have only $25,000."
"7062940","7064580"," And I'm trying and I just built an account. "
"7066000","7068200"," That 25 out of the $100,000."
"7069200","7070340"," What do I do with that?"
"7071300","7074280"," Am I trading $25,000?"
"7074480","7077640"," $5,000 trades on zero dates or weeklies or monthlies?"
"7078100","7078580"," Fuck no."
"7079580","7080360"," Fuck no. "
"7080780","7084520"," And even if I was going to do some de-gen trading, what would I likely start with?"
"7085100","7086640"," Maybe a thousand bucks at most."
"7087200","7087720"," At most."
"7089900","7093920"," At most, 10% of that account, there's 2.5,000, right?"
"7094080","7096280"," So let's say I started, let's say to 10%. "
"7097200","7099100"," And I'm looking at my previous history."
"7099360","7105080"," I'm like, well, I'm going to hit three to six or six to seven of these zero date trades or"
"7105080","7105780"," weekly trades."
"7106360","7107500"," I'm going to lose three of them. "
"7109440","7109840"," Right?"
"7110040","7115840"," Inside of that $25,000 that I have to trade with, what happens is, you know, a lot of you"
"7115840","7116640"," don't even do this."
"7116920","7118420"," You just have the 25K."
"7118560","7122560"," You just have the $2,500 or $1,000 or $1,000 or whatever. "
"7124780","7128100"," What happens is, you start sizing up."
"7128820","7129940"," You're like, okay, you have 25K."
"7130080","7131900"," You're like, I've been disciplined this all the entire time. "
"7132620","7133600"," And I got 25K."
"7133700","7134820"," I can do whatever the fuck I want with."
"7135600","7136820"," And what do the people do?"
"7137360","7139120"," Make a couple of trades for a thousand bucks. "
"7139480","7143380"," They win 200%, 100%, 300%, 1000%, 5,000%."
"7143380","7143860"," Doesn't matter."
"7144540","7146380"," They start sizing up their trades. "
"7147140","7149200"," You can't tell me you don't do that out there, right?"
"7151740","7152680"," Oh, no, no, no."
"7152800","7154040"," Dementi, I'm not talking to you, brother."
"7155440","7156880"," I'm not talking to you, man. "
"7158900","7160060"," This isn't for you, brother."
"7160620","7162720"," This is for the general audience in general."
"7162960","7163500"," We've been talking about this. "
"7163600","7165640"," We've been talking about the same story for years here, man."
"7165640","7166540"," Don't worry, but it's not you."
"7167100","7167900"," I love you, man. "
"7167940","7168260"," You're fine."
"7171200","7174880"," So we'll get back to selling puts on a stock too, just a second here."
"7175540","7178620"," We're going to get back to how to build an account or methods. "
"7179020","7180320"," You can build accounts with call spreads."
"7180540","7184420"," You can build accounts with selling puts or calls against the underlying."
"7184820","7185700"," You can run the wheel. "
"7186240","7190000"," You can do flies, sell flies, buy flies, whatever works for you consistently."
"7191300","7194880"," And whatever you feel most comfortable doing that consistently makes you money."
"7194880","7198480"," I mean, consistently, like nine out of 10 times. "
"7199140","7204200"," Ten trades a year at max, likely less four to six trades a year in size."
"7205380","7207360"," Now, I got that 25k, right?"
"7207720","7208380"," That I can piss away."
"7209340","7210220"," I go in and I make a trade. "
"7210420","7212220"," I'm sitting here in stream with cap and I go fuck."
"7212400","7214700"," Yeah, it's a $1,000 call or zero dates."
"7215000","7215100"," Boom. "
"7215280","7215960"," I just made 3k."
"7216820","7217220"," Well, fuck it."
"7217440","7217820"," Let's up. "
"7217980","7218780"," Let's fucking running."
"7219000","7220300"," That's $3,000, right?"
"7220520","7221300"," So boom, I do it again."
"7221980","7223400"," See where this problems start coming in. "
"7224040","7224560"," Right?"
"7224880","7226620"," Then I torch one down, right?"
"7226760","7227740"," My third trade, I burn."
"7228360","7229040"," Nine grand gone."
"7229220","7231000"," I go back to the 25k that I can spend. "
"7231820","7232340"," Right?"
"7233060","7234680"," I never took that 9k out."
"7234940","7238140"," I never removed any money to build anything anywhere else."
"7238260","7246000"," I never took that money out to buy gold bars or baseball cards or a house fund or a money"
"7246000","7248800"," market or buying the underlying of spy or anything else. "
"7249440","7249800"," Right?"
"7249940","7254180"," I dip back into that 25,000 again and I go to myself."
"7254420","7254660"," You know what?"
"7254860","7257580"," I started with that 25,000 with 1,000 bucks."
"7257760","7260800"," I'm going to try to make that 9 grand I lost back. "
"7261060","7264540"," So I'm going to make this next trade with $9,000 out of that 25."
"7264860","7267060"," So now I'm down 10k and make a trade and I lose it."
"7267740","7270720"," Now my 25k, I made it was down to 15, right?"
"7271640","7275440"," And you're looking at the nine you lost, the nine you lost, the nine you lost, and the nine you"
"7275440","7275980"," lost. "
"7277540","7281540"," And you start like gambling it until you burn that whole $25,000."
"7282020","7283360"," Start revenge trading."
"7283520","7284280"," It gets horrible. "
"7293360","7296080"," You guys are hilarious."
"7297080","7298740"," I'm going to drink some coffee or a little."
"7301450","7306110"," And normally this is the stage where I step in and say, stop fucking trading. "
"7307370","7308810"," And stick to a plan."
"7309810","7311650"," Your original plan, right?"
"7313430","7317870"," I mean, tell me you're telling me right now if you're watching my show, you're telling me none of"
"7317870","7319130"," this sounds familiar to you."
"7320170","7325370"," So anyways, if you are I'm guilty of it. "
"7325530","7327230"," Do you think I'm yelling at you?"
"7327950","7330690"," I'm telling you this because I have done this myself."
"7331570","7332630"," Okay, I've done this."
"7332850","7334470"," I've been in this market two fucking long. "
"7334470","7336410"," I went, you do that enough."
"7336730","7339850"," You're going to either leave the market or you're going to learn your fucking lesson eventually."
"7341230","7341730"," Okay. "
"7342090","7347130"," You're going to take your hits enough that you are going to learn or you're going to get washed out"
"7347130","7347490"," permanently."
"7349850","7354210"," Now, I explained how to build an account on the general outline safely."
"7355890","7358070"," I bet 90% of you don't want to do that. "
"7358950","7361250"," There is another way to build an account."
"7363330","7364310"," That does work."
"7365830","7367490"," And that is where you're a DJ. "
"7368310","7369870"," You go to your job every week."
"7370710","7372290"," You live in your mom's basement."
"7372290","7375030"," Your mom says to you, you're such a beautiful boy. "
"7375310","7377830"," I love your eyes and your hair and your skin is so soft."
"7377830","7378570"," Let me rub your back."
"7378790","7380150"," I'm going to make you some chicken tenders. "
"7380890","7383470"," I got you your 24 pack of Mountain Dew."
"7384490","7386830"," And don't worry about my boyfriend upstairs."
"7387150","7389670"," Honey, you just live in the basement and do your thing, right?"
"7389670","7391670"," So you're like, yeah, I get to go to work all week long. "
"7392330","7393410"," I don't have to pay for shit."
"7393930","7396210"," And I take my check every Friday and I just let it ride."
"7397110","7398890"," And I know there's a portion of you that do that. "
"7399850","7401610"," A good portion of you that do that."
"7402250","7406590"," If it blows up, you don't care because you can go back to your job and bring back another check."
"7407430","7412050"," You can pick up a, I don't know, delivering food or something with like DoorDash or some shit. "
"7413010","7415550"," The gig economy probably fuels a ton of this."
"7416290","7418190"," I'll just go deliver Amazon packages."
"7419210","7419650"," Right?"
"7420810","7422930"," Well, I got to answer this really quick. "
"7428020","7429660"," My daughter is laughing at me."
"7437950","7439430"," My daughter can hear me."
"7440870","7441670"," Okay, so. "
"7444670","7448590"," If you're a DJ that wants to grow in accounts, there is a way to do it."
"7448890","7451390"," You go to work every week until you hit it big."
"7452490","7454150"," That is viable as well. "
"7454730","7458030"," If you're willing to accept that you're going to blow up your account once a week and you're going"
"7458030","7461030"," to de-gen trade, I'm going to make my paycheck."
"7461310","7461930"," It's a thousand bucks."
"7462050","7463910"," I let it run right on GME. "
"7464870","7466070"," Eventually, you're going to hit it."
"7466750","7467450"," That's a fact."
"7467870","7472470"," At some point, you're going to make one trade that's going to be a fucking grand slam. "
"7473810","7477090"," You're going to do that five times, ten times, twenty times."
"7477270","7478470"," I don't care if it takes 30 times."
"7478470","7484490"," So you make that grand slam trade, boom, thousand bucks, knock it out of the park. "
"7485230","7485970"," You made five K."
"7487010","7490410"," What is often, think about this for yourself out there if you're watching right now."
"7490950","7492390"," What's your next thing that you do?"
"7493230","7494170"," You take another one."
"7494770","7496130"," Do you trade a thousand bucks?"
"7496970","7497190"," Fuck. "
"7497410","7498130"," No, you don't."
"7498710","7500990"," You take another de-gen trade, right?"
"7501770","7504570"," And another de-gen trade, another de-gen trade."
"7505930","7510510"," When, in fact, you probably should have taken that five grand and taken four away from yourself. "
"7511310","7515650"," So I had a thousand bucks from my job and I made a five grand."
"7516070","7521970"," You likely should have taken four thousand dollars at minimum away from yourself if you're going to"
"7521970","7526550"," continue to do the de-gen trading to build your account."
"7527050","7530590"," So you have four more chances to knock it out of the park again. "
"7532110","7537250"," So let's say you make your five grand, you pull your four out and you take another trade, you limit"
"7537250","7539210"," yourself to a thousand bucks, you lose."
"7540570","7545290"," You make another trade, zero dates, you think is a trend day, you win."
"7546350","7547450"," So now you're up on your account. "
"7548910","7552910"," You lost a thousand, you made five grand, you're now up nine thousand dollars."
"7553550","7557130"," Another common part is it kicks in again, right?"
"7557350","7558470"," Well, dude, I just made nine grand."
"7558470","7560330"," I had a, I started with a thousand, bro. "
"7560790","7562290"," I'm going to size up my zero dates."
"7562390","7564650"," I'm going to go to three grand trade, right?"
"7564830","7566510"," So now you're down to three tries again."
"7567070","7570890"," So when you're like building an account, it should be more, hey, it's my thousand bucks. "
"7570990","7575710"," I hit it out of the park, I made five grand and you try to be a trader on de "
"7575710","7579430","-gen trades where you're cranking at least three of ten trades."
"7580310","7585890"," I would prefer that it would be ten or not, assuming six or seven or eight of those ten trades"
"7585890","7587550"," of smaller size."
"7590050","7594770"," Now, once you get to that amount of money, let's say you've meet someone, I meet these guys all the"
"7594770","7595230"," time, right?"
"7595330","7597850"," You'll meet some of them like, oh, bro, I'm killing it right now. "
"7598410","7601750"," I started with three thousand bucks, I've got a thirty thousand dollar account now."
"7602610","7606930"," I bet you, if you were to see their, if you see someone growing an account from a thousand bucks,"
"7607950","7610150"," four or five grand and they grew up to thirty or fifty."
"7611050","7615470"," If you check their last two or three trades, I guarantee their trading size. "
"7615470","7617850"," Garen fucking fifteen."
"7618530","7624630"," And I also guarantee that when they get that account grown to at least twenty five or thirty grand,"
"7625130","7627890"," they never stop doing the de-gen trades."
"7628710","7633450"," So then actually truly grow the account with sure things that are boring. "
"7634190","7640350"," Either owning the market and taking the profits from that, or owning the market and selling puts or"
"7640350","7643850"," calls and using that money to continue to grow their account."
"7644430","7650050"," So like the de-gen just sticks with you when you're growing the accounts from zero or a thousand"
"7650050","7651670"," bucks or five thousand dollars."
"7652290","7656130"," And a good way to combat that, your own investing and trading journey. "
"7656830","7663570"," It doesn't really matter how you choose to, in my view, it doesn't matter what method you choose to"
"7663570","7664230"," grow your account."
"7665090","7666390"," But I got to say something to you."
"7667070","7670570"," Keep track of how you're growing your account. "
"7671310","7674730"," And where do the losses start to come in?"
"7675430","7678990"," Like at that moment, where are you starting to take major losses?"
"7679810","7683690"," And try to find where you're assigning those, how you assign those things."
"7691780","7696200"," Yeah, Troy Baker said, not that I listened to my own advice as much as I should, but my plan"
"7696200","7700880"," is to is to I keep ten percent of my profit in trading the G account."
"7701660","7704400"," And then ninety percent goes to an investment account. "
"7704520","7705000"," I agree with that."
"7705000","7708180"," You guys see me in here when I lose trades here, right?"
"7708540","7710180"," I just lost ten K on a stream."
"7710920","7713260"," I think two weeks ago, I lost ten K on a stream. "
"7713700","7714440"," Something like that."
"7714600","7715700"," It was like a week or two ago."
"7715900","7716800"," It was two weeks ago, I think. "
"7717960","7723080"," And one of you guys said to me, I think it was six grand that was up to ten grand."
"7723700","7725640"," I think my buy-in was six grand or something like that."
"7725760","7726020"," It was up. "
"7726400","7729560"," I think it turned six to ten thousand and then it went to zero."
"7731880","7738160"," And someone in the stream mentioned to me, hey, Cap, I'm taking the money here at R1 or R2 or"
"7738160","7738460"," something."
"7739480","7740880"," And that would be my normal rule. "
"7741320","7742560"," I make those rules for myself."
"7743000","7750600"," Take the money on R1, re-enter the trade again for R2 on a successful retest below on the one"
"7750600","7751660"," in five minute trigger, right?"
"7752540","7754520"," And this guy in stream took the money and ran."
"7754520","7755580"," He was like, thanks, Cap. "
"7755900","7757380"," And I didn't lose anything."
"7758180","7759580"," And I got torched in that trade."
"7759940","7762120"," And I didn't follow my own rules in that trade. "
"7763300","7767300"," That's an example for you guys to see when I'm breaking my own rules."
"7768040","7769060"," How often I lose."
"7769540","7773960"," I lose frequently when I break my rules here on stream. "
"7775500","7776780"," And you guys hear my rules."
"7777100","7781820"," If any guys are here every day, day in, day out, know what my rules are for my own trading."
"7781820","7787960"," And you guys always see when I lose money in size, it's always because I'm breaking my own rules. "
"7788220","7789260"," And why do I have those rules?"
"7790140","7791320"," Because I've fucking been there."
"7791720","7801120"," I've done my trader log, my trader diary, my trading journal, where I look back and I know where I"
"7801120","7801800"," lose my money."
"7802080","7807000"," So when I start, I'm not following my fucking rules, right?"
"7807280","7809160"," Where I've had major losses in the past. "
"7813730","7815010"," You guys got what I'm saying?"
"7815350","7818890"," So anyways, we're launching this new Discord."
"7819730","7827810"," When we launched this new Discord, John L, David AMS, a few of the guys are going to be offering"
"7827810","7833570"," mentorships in this new Discord, private mentorships and private rooms."
"7834330","7839490"," So if any of you are interested in that kind of stuff, it's going to be reopening or restarting up"
"7839490","7840830"," here in February. "
"7842970","7846170"," With educational material, videos, all kinds of cool stuff."
"7846610","7852350"," So if you are a losing trader, please try to try to get back into it."
"7852470","7857850"," Try to make like a New Year's resolution to get back in to some kind of a mentorship program in"
"7857850","7858430"," tooth February. "
"7859830","7862750"," So you're not consistently a loser."
"7863170","7871150"," And you're following other people's trades or not necessarily doing what they do, but having some"
"7871150","7872670"," kind of a mix as to what they do."
"7873470","7878950"," You know, it's hard to be like, well, I lost a trade or a trade zero dates here. "
"7879550","7880830"," That's my whole entire account."
"7881010","7886370"," And I did it three times and I double tripled down, but that's all a recipe for failure."
"7887150","7893870"," To not have consistent or to not get to a point in your career where you have consistent money"
"7893870","7897210"," coming from other places to always keep you funded in case you do. "
"7897430","7902390"," So I've blown myself up big time three times three times."
"7902590","7905150"," Yeah, three times I've blown myself up where it was."
"7905310","7910550"," I've actually killed options trading accounts of six figure value. "
"7912870","7919090"," Now, the first time I did not have any money anywhere else, but the second to toe of the times"
"7919090","7923170"," I did have investments that I was able to replace money in those accounts."
"7923570","7929310"," But that was only through hard work and struggling to like take money out and have money to refund"
"7929310","7929950"," myself."
"7930690","7935770"," But that is the goal that you should have as well that at some point or some point you're removing"
"7935770","7938710"," money from the market that always give you the money that you need to be in the market. "
"7941280","7943940"," Yeah, this stuff should be on a video more."
"7944180","7945740"," I'm doing this off the cuff right now."
"7945840","7949380"," So there's going to be a sloppy saying this stuff to you guys right now. "
"7949420","7952780"," It's not concise and it's not laid out like an essay."
"7953960","7956040"," But you get the gist of what I'm saying here."
"7957560","7960000"," I think you do get the gist at least what I'm saying here. "
"7961580","7964360"," There's a step by step process to grow an account that's responsible."
"7965000","7970060"," There's a irresponsible way to grow an account that can be fruitful for you too."
"7970820","7977900"," But it's the steps after when you do hit it big that we fall into those traps of trading too"
"7977900","7978420"," much size. "
"7979760","7987960"," Still doing de-gen trades not removing fucking money from the market that will eventually pay you"
"7987960","7989340"," to be in the market."
"7993090","7994690"," What else I got here for you."
"7998590","8000670"," Yeah, I mean, it's true, right?"
"8001190","8010930"," The guys that I've talked about this in the past doing an entire educational webpage on our website"
"8010930","8012830"," where it's like step one. "
"8013570","8015490"," This is what a savings account is."
"8015850","8019150"," Like literally, this is a savings account."
"8020150","8027630"," You know, do you take five 15% of your paycheck and invest in a savings account that your wife"
"8027630","8031810"," doesn't know about, that your husband doesn't know about, that your kids don't have access to. "
"8032430","8033150"," That's out of sight."
"8033330","8034530"," You know, I got a good one for you."
"8035350","8036450"," This is a good one for you. "
"8037630","8038990"," So I spent a lot of years."
"8039170","8040210"," So I've got I've got kids."
"8041490","8047030"," My wife and I used to live in very wealthy places. "
"8047710","8049470"," It was not cheap to live there."
"8050410","8051790"," We lived above our means."
"8053650","8058490"," We lived a lifestyle that required a lot of money. "
"8059630","8062570"," And we were in the great American dream, right?"
"8063230","8064230"," You work your ass off."
"8065010","8066570"," You live a great lifestyle."
"8066810","8069650"," But at any moment, you can lose everything. "
"8070070","8074650"," If I got hurt, if I got sick, if I got laid off or fired, everything would be gone."
"8075190","8076110"," Economy goes down."
"8076290","8076650"," Earn the gun. "
"8076810","8077970"," It was the rat race, right?"
"8078170","8079950"," That capitalism in this country is."
"8083370","8085110"," So I was in that rat race, right?"
"8088650","8092090"," I used to tell my wife, I shouldn't say this publicly."
"8093570","8094830"," But I used to tell my wife. "
"8096230","8101690"," I used to say to her, you know, it never mattered what we made."
"8101690","8111450"," It didn't matter if we made $2,000 a week, $4,000 a week, $6,000 a week, $1,000"
"8111450","8112130"," a week, $1,000 a week."
"8113230","8115930"," My wife was full bore pregnant, right?"
"8116230","8119770"," Nine months pregnant with one kid at home and another kid on the way. "
"8120790","8122030"," We weren't making a lot of money."
"8122330","8123830"," It was only my money coming in."
"8124170","8126630"," And we starved in these places that we live. "
"8126890","8127890"," These nice places, right?"
"8128790","8130770"," Robin Peter to pay Paul to pay bills."
"8131850","8133130"," Something would happen, right?"
"8133570","8134870"," Truck breaks down."
"8136250","8137210"," Unexpected bills. "
"8139390","8141990"," You're like a heating bill that I didn't expect, right?"
"8142910","8147330"," You guys, I'm assuming some of most of you have been in those situations right in life where you're"
"8147330","8148690"," Robin Peter to pay Paul, right?"
"8150910","8154810"," What I noticed as I got older was that it never mattered."
"8155650","8158990"," How much money we made, we spent it all."
"8160890","8161870"," We spent it all. "
"8162870","8164550"," We're bringing a thousand bucks a week."
"8164810","8165410"," We spent it all."
"8165650","8167550"," If you brought in 2,000, we spent it all. "
"8168070","8169990"," We found a way to spend all that money."
"8170690","8176790"," We also found a way to live with less money when we made less money."
"8176950","8180150"," We found a way to make ourselves or to live when we made a lot of money. "
"8180830","8182230"," But it was always gone."
"8183130","8188110"," So if you think to yourself out there that you can't start a check or savings account."
"8188870","8193450"," If you're like, Hey, cap, I can't save 5 or 15% a week. "
"8194070","8194809"," Life sucks."
"8195330","8196469"," All this shit comes at me."
"8196709","8204129"," I assure you that regardless of what you make in your pay every week, whether it's two grand or one"
"8204129","8207309"," grand, you're going to find a way to spend it. "
"8208629","8212270"," So if you have two grand coming in every week and all of a sudden you go to a thousand,"
"8212809","8214030"," how did you make it?"
"8215709","8216629"," How did you make it work?"
"8217590","8220709"," So to say I want to take 5 or 15% of my check every week and just put into"
"8220709","8223110"," a fucking savings account is absurd."
"8224330","8226830"," You just got to make it out of sight and out of mind."
"8227410","8232070"," Joe Donut and I were talking this week about a app, an app that he has. "
"8232350","8238209"," They just put it on his phone and Joe's a wealthy guy."
"8239049","8245690"," But he was most fascinated by this app because you don't even know the money's being removed and"
"8245690","8247430"," put into an account that you can't look"
"8247430","8256809"," or see."
"8256809","8263030"," So no matter what that paycheck is, find a way to get that money out of that fucking paycheck where"
"8263030","8265850"," it's out of sight and out of mind and you're not thinking about it. "
"8266549","8269709"," It's like a line item deduction every fucking Friday."
"8270770","8273930"," And after about a month or two, you're not even going to think about it."
"8274650","8277969"," Your wife, your husband, your partner, your lover. "
"8278650","8281510"," No one's going to know that that money is gone."
"8281670","8282830"," They'll just get used to it."
"8283110","8284430"," Get them saying used to it. "
"8285490","8288250"," You used to make in two grand, you used to make in one grand."
"8288770","8289290"," Doesn't matter."
"8289830","8292030"," That money is just out of sight and out of mind. "
"8292190","8294350"," That is your step fucking one."
"8298299","8299559"," You understand what I'm saying here?"
"8300940","8303379"," Then you're going to move up to a 401k, right?"
"8303900","8305760"," Then you're going to move up to a money market account."
"8306760","8310059"," And you're going to start when you start to grow and have some you can't really. "
"8310320","8312940"," I don't know what the bottom is now to enter a money market."
"8312940","8314680"," I think it's like five or 15 grand."
"8314680","8318680"," But eventually you're going to save enough of that savings account that your banker is likely going"
"8318680","8320660"," to come to you and say, I don't know. "
"8320760","8324799"," Hey, Mr. Smith, we see that your savings account here is $15,000."
"8325500","8330340"," We're offering a money market account that pays up to 15% a year, which like to push roll your"
"8330340","8331219"," money into that account."
"8331980","8333500"," Let me have you sit down at the desk over here. "
"8333920","8334440"," Can you do that?"
"8335379","8336180"," Does that make sense?"
"8337340","8339440"," And you'll continue to grow that money over time."
"8339900","8342420"," And you'll be given offers from your bank."
"8342420","8344020"," Hey, Mr. Smith. "
"8344820","8349700"," We noticed that your money market pound has grown to $150,000."
"8350379","8351879"," And we noticed that you don't own a home."
"8352020","8352959"," You don't have a mortgage with us. "
"8353160","8353719"," Are you a renter?"
"8354580","8355559"," You understand what I'm saying?"
"8355719","8358500"," So you always have to have that money growing somewhere in the background."
"8362100","8363360"," Oh, I'm saying I got to give a sip."
"8363620","8364600"," A little dehydrated here. "
"8379770","8382389"," The liquids of light, coffee and water."
"8386889","8388310"," Well, yeah, John, I agree."
"8388530","8389390"," I should have brought that up. "
"8389470","8392010"," Get out of debt to that's a whole another conversation, right?"
"8394290","8399870"," But yes, getting out of debt is part of that to stop taking on fucking debt and pay your debt"
"8399870","8400270"," down."
"8401670","8403230"," Consolidate your debt and get rid of it."
"8403410","8405770"," That's a whole nother apple. "
"8406130","8408130"," But I agree with you to their John Haggerty."
"8408310","8409490"," John Hagger just brought up."
"8410110","8410970"," Thank you, Adrian. "
"8413510","8414670"," When did he say that?"
"8414790","8416130"," I thought I saw John Haggerty said that."
"8417990","8419050"," Stop taking on debt."
"8421350","8428930"," Live within your means that these are whole other concepts, but or that are part of that same a"
"8428930","8431090"," larger conversation of get out of debt. "
"8431730","8433450"," Stop fucking using credit cards."
"8434390","8440490"," Stop buying brand new cars by a car that's in your means with cash, because it's a depreciating"
"8440490","8440790"," asset."
"8441730","8447350"," I don't care if you can afford a $1,000 car, $5,000 car, $10,000 car. "
"8447870","8450270"," You buy a car when you're young, you buy a car with cash."
"8450270","8454630"," As you get older and do these other things, you'll still buy your cars with cash."
"8455690","8456890"," You have an AMEX car. "
"8456970","8458050"," Eventually you get an AMEX car."
"8458170","8459770"," You pay it every month, the end of the month."
"8460970","8463410"," You do those things and your life will change. "
"8463790","8465910"," You can start that too at any time in your life."
"8467150","8470030"," You should not care what people think about you."
"8470250","8475570"," The Johnsons, the Smiths, your neighbors, your mother, your brother. "
"8475570","8478510"," I don't care if you make a lot of money."
"8480030","8482470"," Flashing money is not the success in life."
"8483730","8484830"," I'll tell you what feels good. "
"8487510","8492790"," Our tax system is built for me to take on mortgages and re-mortgage my properties."
"8493110","8493830"," I don't do that."
"8495270","8497330"," I love that I don't do that. "
"8498030","8500150"," I'm always afraid of something bad."
"8500690","8504670"," There's a mechanism to take all your money away from you by the time you get old."
"8505890","8511150"," Our system is built for you to re-mortgage all over your shit, but then take it away from you"
"8511150","8512390"," when you hit your 60s and 70s. "
"8512910","8521010"," I'm trying to not take part in that personally, but when you're able to buy shit with cash, buy"
"8521010","8524230"," even appreciating assets with cash, I'm not trying to leverage this stuff."
"8524410","8528450"," I used to leverage this stuff, but I want to take on more risk, but I'm getting older, or I"
"8528450","8529310"," try not to anymore."
"8530030","8531410"," I understand why you'd want to do that. "
"8531450","8532810"," That's building an account too, right?"
"8533390","8541390"," You buy a house, you paint on your mortgage, and you try to leverage that with credit to make more"
"8541390","8546890"," money safely, putting risk on when you're younger."
"8547250","8547750"," You can do that."
"8547910","8554330"," I'm not completely against that either, but at some point you want to be rich. "
"8554330","8563770"," Rich people do leverage their money, but at least for me where I'm at right now, and I don't want"
"8563770","8568950"," to give all my wealth back to you, or if you're young, you."
"8569210","8570750"," I want to keep it, and then give it to my kids."
"8575290","8577790"," There's no shame in driving a used car. "
"8579590","8580790"," Some of you can't, though."
"8580950","8581610"," I realize that."
"8582190","8586650"," That's another thing too. "
"8593170","8598750"," If you don't have to, if you park in a big garage or in a big parking lot, fuck that."
"8599430","8601550"," I would not be trying to keep up with the Johnson's."
"8605050","8606670"," Yeah, John and Hagerty, I saw that. "
"8606850","8607610"," Family saw it again."
"8607870","8609210"," Rule number one, get out of debt."
"8609830","8610270"," 100%. "
"8610270","8612810"," And especially depreciating debt."
"8614050","8615650"," There's like good debt and bad debt."
"8616470","8618150"," And to be in bad debt. "
"8618170","8624570"," So something like $150,000 fucking truck nuts truck is for pavement princess."
"8624850","8625710"," I don't understand that."
"8626250","8627690"," That blows my mind. "
"8629410","8630870"," Is your net worth $3 million?"
"8631550","8633130"," $5 million net worth."
"8633810","8636170"," I don't mean I got, I want a house that's worth $5 million."
"8636930","8639190"," Is your liquid net worth $5 million?"
"8639190","8644510"," If not, you have no fucking business buying a $150,000 truck. "
"8645550","8647150"," Zero business doing that."
"8647550","8649450"," But we know that happens all the time."
"8650010","8654130"," You know that, or you might not know this, but you might be looking at your neighbor thinking"
"8654130","8656490"," they're financially making the great decisions in life. "
"8656790","8657810"," I assure you they're not."
"8658370","8664950"," They're likely one month, three months, six months away from disaster."
"8668160","8669200"," Right on Momo. "
"8670680","8672300"," Yeah, I don't, I don't mind it either."
"8672480","8674380"," I used to buy real ship boxes."
"8674540","8679040"," Now I buy like a five year old vehicle normally about five years old, four years old. "
"8679920","8683040"," As a matter of fact, I'm on a one of my vehicles, well, both vehicles."
"8683420","8684820"," So my, I have a Cadillac."
"8686260","8686640"," Escalade. "
"8687480","8688660"," I think I bought that."
"8690480","8691580"," 2018 or 19."
"8692480","8694180"," So I'm getting ready to get rid of it. "
"8695500","8697500"," But I've paid cash."
"8699400","8701920"," It's been a great daily driver for me."
"8702080","8702960"," My wife drives a Tesla. "
"8704500","8706240"," I had another Tesla too."
"8706400","8707960"," We actually had two Teslas at one time."
"8708200","8708860"," I bought those used. "
"8709880","8711060"," I didn't buy brand new fucking Tesla."
"8711960","8712880"," I bought them used."
"8714280","8718900"," And bottom of cash appreciating asset with extra money that I had. "
"8719500","8724040"," I didn't pay somebody else that loan and that card didn't lose a ton of value."
"8724040","8724720"," And all that other stuff."
"8724880","8727400"," I've gotten killer use out of it. "
"8728000","8730460"," Now that I ever would have gotten in a payment plan."
"8732480","8733540"," Yeah, I don't like that."
"8733740","8734280"," I don't like the. "
"8734380","8735880"," So I was never an Escalade driver."
"8737440","8738380"," I'm from out west."
"8738660","8740760"," So I always drove Toyota Tundra was my truck. "
"8741380","8743920"," But I moved to the city in Detroit."
"8743980","8745060"," So I wanted to blend in."
"8745740","8748080"," So everyone here drives vehicles like that. "
"8748600","8750740"," They don't drive Subaru's and Toyota's."
"8750740","8755200"," And they drive like a really fancy F one 50s and Dodge Rams."
"8755580","8758840"," And they drive Cadillac's and stuff like that here. "
"8759340","8761060"," Yeah, they, they prefer the BMW."
"8764600","8766920"," So I was trying to fit in where I live."
"8768120","8769440"," I love Honda's too. "
"8769820","8770460"," I love Honda."
"8770600","8771000"," I love Toyota."
"8783010","8784590"," What do you got here?"
"8784710","8786730"," WC picked up some 15 March calls. "
"8787070","8787930"," Six of all calls off the hearing."
"8788130","8789490"," Same we discussed discussion yesterday."
"8790370","8794770"," AP 240 price now 305 not a fan of CMC, but the call was correct in this case. "
"8795070","8795110"," Nice."
"8795310","8795790"," Good job, John."
"8800890","8801570"," I don't know. "
"8801650","8802930"," I don't see the need for it."
"8802990","8806990"," I'd rather if some guy buys $150,000 truck brand new off the lot."
"8808010","8810030"," I'm sure that out of a hundred people that do that. "
"8810030","8812750"," There's going to be one asshole that can't afford that payment."
"8813430","8814290"," He drives it."
"8814290","8814650"," That's a lot. "
"8814730","8815490"," It's not worth 90."
"8816250","8816650"," Right."
"8816850","8820690"," So I can go buy that truck for 90 K on a repo or a trade in. "
"8821390","8823110"," I would take that deal all day long."
"8823330","8824070"," A couple more years."
"8824670","8828710"," Probably catch that truck for 75 65 with real cash. "
"8829630","8831750"," I don't make that any of those payments, right?"
"8831970","8836130"," I have to make the payment zero present interest at the full sticker price."
"8836130","8840810"," I'll take that loan where if I ever lose my job."
"8841550","8843770"," I'll lose my truck, my vehicle to get to work. "
"8844650","8846550"," I'm living within my means."
"8847970","8849830"," The pavement princess, baby."
"8853530","8857390"," I just got asked this captain's Tesla dump on ER. "
"8859290","8862010"," In my view, I'll give you three."
"8862230","8863350"," I'll give you two things here."
"8864250","8865090"," It's. "
"8866010","8868010"," It's setting up to rip."
"8870830","8873830"," Under any other circumstance, I would say."
"8876950","8879490"," Under any other circumstance, I would say. "
"8880070","8883190"," We're likely going to trade that 232."
"8884250","8887890"," 235 area and continue to the downside."
"8890850","8898730"," On this ER, though, you've taken the consideration dealers and you've taken the consideration"
"8898730","8900050"," sentiment. "
"8901030","8905970"," I've taken the consideration are CTA is long, which they're not."
"8907390","8913890"," And the volatility of this event and the sentiment oftentimes is you buy Tesla."
"8913890","8922910"," If we trade down into Tesla ER, you typically wait until this expiry ends the 26th contract ends to"
"8922910","8923430"," long Tesla. "
"8923970","8924530"," Now, Netflix."
"8925870","8928870"," They ramped it into the close before yesterday, which is abnormal."
"8929590","8930310"," And they also. "
"8931870","8933670"," Held everything until this morning."
"8933930","8937550"," So we could see some change up by here in Tesla where they ramp it."
"8938670","8942530"," But in my view, if you want my honest opinion. "
"8943690","8946970"," I'm in this trade to try to get capture what I can today."
"8947650","8950750"," I don't really want to get trapped into holding through ER today."
"8952170","8953530"," And I would really like to buy. "
"8953870","8954750"," I'd really like to see."
"8956130","8956970"," Tesla burn."
"8957630","8958190"," A bull. "
"8958630","8959070"," But Tesla bull."
"8959390","8960570"," I'd really like to see Tesla burn."
"8962570","8966970"," Into the 26th expiry and then look for that turnaround. "
"8967670","8970190"," Now, all bets are off on ER."
"8970530","8971030"," Give me a quick second."
"8971190","8972030"," I'm going to show you guys something here. "
"8977240","8979240"," This is a good example for you guys here."
"8981180","8983640"," What we're going to talk about is we're going to talk about."
"8984580","8990240"," We're going to start the conversation with the JPM caller. "
"8992560","8993700"," JPM caller trade."
"8994380","8997820"," If you take that trade, right, that JPM caller trade."
"8998740","9000840"," Nine out of ten times you're going to win that trade. "
"9001640","9003980"," We popped the caller the last quarter."
"9004580","9005800"," You would have lost that trade."
"9009380","9017700"," On the JPM caller, if you were just trading the markets versus the JPM range expectations, right,"
"9018080","9019040"," you would have lost that trade. "
"9020760","9022280"," Not owning the underlying."
"9022740","9024960"," It's going to print even if you're trading the caller."
"9024960","9027820"," But if you just traded the market against the caller, you would have lost. "
"9029780","9032800"," But the other nine times you would have won, right?"
"9034680","9036340"," So we're going to get Tesla really quick."
"9037940","9040020"," And we're going to go to the trigger screen here."
"9040920","9041360"," Shit. "
"9041980","9043540"," We're going to get fucking cameras out."
"9045660","9047820"," We're going to look at Tesla quickly here."
"9051910","9053130"," And we're going to talk Tesla. "
"9055030","9057590"," And we're talking the law of probabilities."
"9059070","9064410"," This is something that, this is something that I can't seem to get through people."
"9065050","9071210"," And oftentimes you can't get this concept through to people because they're listening to the"
"9071210","9071670"," Internet. "
"9072990","9080350"," A lot of you would do very well by turning the Internet off, being literally turning off social"
"9080350","9080810"," media."
"9081810","9086450"," A lot of you would be much better investors and traders if you just turned off the Internet."
"9088170","9090570"," We're going to go to a 30 minute chart here, okay?"
"9092690","9093370"," On Tesla. "
"9094490","9098490"," I had someone recently tell me they go, yeah, that's hindsight trading."
"9098710","9099370"," I'm like, no, it's not."
"9099530","9100450"," It's not hindsight trading. "
"9102510","9103910"," We're discussing this."
"9103990","9105810"," They said, how do you know when to buy Tesla?"
"9106150","9107510"," You can't know when to buy Tesla."
"9107510","9111510"," And I showed them this and they still disagreed. "
"9115660","9119300"," Now Tesla trades in velocity and it's daily velocity, okay?"
"9120360","9128020"," Whenever Tesla comes down in trades minus 50 on its daily velocity and then shows a series of"
"9128020","9136220"," higher lows in their daily velocity, it predicts a turn to the upside, a major turn to the upside,"
"9137280","9139540"," for a length of time either time or price."
"9140220","9143900"," It's either price or time to get to price, okay?"
"9146080","9150710"," Now that doesn't mean we can't have a little toothed up here, right?"
"9151380","9151900"," See that right here?"
"9152000","9154200"," We've got bullish velocity here."
"9154700","9155840"," We have a little toothed up here. "
"9156720","9163160"," And oftentimes I'll get all of the people saying to me things like, well, you missed this part of"
"9163160","9164360"," the trade right there, Captain."
"9164360","9173910"," And the truth be told, you're looking for nine out of ten times"
"9173910","9175790"," that you are correct."
"9176750","9180910"," Not the one time that it continued to go up, right?"
"9181590","9185270"," You're looking for consistency in winning trades. "
"9185870","9186590"," There's one right there."
"9187190","9189270"," There's one right there, right?"
"9190070","9190710"," Consistency."
"9191730","9194170"," We're back to our original conversation we were having earlier, right?"
"9195070","9198550"," So right down here, you can kind of see, right?"
"9200450","9202190"," We're bottoming in daily velocity. "
"9202990","9206330"," Great place to long Tesla, okay?"
"9207230","9208510"," Here's another one right here."
"9211620","9214020"," Great place to long Tesla, right?"
"9214560","9215800"," Even if you long get right here."
"9217460","9219700"," Great place to long Tesla, right?"
"9220860","9227420"," Now, when I take these trades, whether I'm buying the underlying in Tesla, or I'm buying spreads,"
"9228440","9230540"," right?"
"9230800","9233420"," You'll encounter another argument from people. "
"9233660","9236340"," So let's say I buy a Tesla spread right here for size."
"9238500","9242260"," And I only need this much, or I only need this much."
"9243480","9245620"," So I buy my Tesla spread in here. "
"9247160","9251380"," I'm confident because I'm down here on major negative daily velocity."
"9252460","9253580"," And burr I get a print."
"9256080","9257780"," And you see me on social media. "
"9258240","9260420"," Oftentimes I'll say I'm getting out of Tesla now."
"9261760","9263760"," And people say to me, well I'm staying long here."
"9264280","9265280"," I understand why they are. "
"9265540","9266500"," They want to max it out, right?"
"9266820","9268760"," But they're taking on more risk too, right?"
"9269860","9270900"," And they're like, ha ha captain."
"9271100","9271440"," Look at all that."
"9271720","9272140"," Look at all that. "
"9272280","9273740"," Woo captain, you missed all this."
"9274900","9278080"," What they're in your, this is to you too out there."
"9279260","9283640"," You'll hear people say those things and you'll say, fuck I gotta, why didn't I just take the entire"
"9283640","9283920"," trade?"
"9284080","9285800"," Why didn't I take, make the trade all of this?"
"9286180","9286760"," Why did I get greedy?"
"9287420","9288400"," Why didn't I keep doing all this?"
"9288640","9290140"," You can zero date weekly trade this. "
"9290300","9290600"," That's fine."
"9290760","9295940"," But truth is that over 10 years or five years and any ticker."
"9296360","9301660"," If I'm just taking that money and running, taking that money and running, right?"
"9301660","9304360"," I've got, I've actually accumulated two perfect trades. "
"9305220","9305620"," Make sense?"
"9307560","9309740"," And so I am looking for that."
"9310980","9312720"," Here's another example down here."
"9317680","9318640"," Right down here. "
"9319400","9321060"," Enough time in that trade would pay off, right?"
"9322280","9322960"," Three months."
"9324260","9328620"," One, like I start usually like one and a half months, but then three months for spread to be even"
"9328620","9328900"," safer."
"9330000","9331060"," But there's another one right there. "
"9337480","9341380"," See this one right here where it wasn't at minus 50, it's like minus 25."
"9342100","9343260"," Down here you get another one, right?"
"9344720","9345340"," See that?"
"9347900","9350880"," Series of higher lows, we're getting torched on that trade, right?"
"9351680","9352660"," Straight up torched."
"9352820","9354280"," And that wasn't minus 50, was it?"
"9354820","9355780"," So I don't like that trade. "
"9355980","9360040"," I like minus 50, the big ones, like the big dippers, like that one right there."
"9361020","9361520"," Does that make sense?"
"9362500","9363460"," So I want consistency."
"9365680","9367460"," Right here's a nice little dip breakdown. "
"9367780","9369000"," It's a major low right there."
"9372990","9374490"," Major low right there, right?"
"9374570","9376330"," And this right in here you get a major."
"9376430","9381950"," Major capitulation move in price and in daily velocity. "
"9383030","9387170"," So if I continue back here and start looking at these things, I can find."
"9387990","9390170"," Now here's one where I would have missed a bunch, right?"
"9391070","9392410"," I would have missed all this right here."
"9392890","9393870"," I would have, I would have been crying. "
"9393870","9396510"," Oh my, I'm missing all that trade and all this money up in here."
"9397410","9398570"," But where did it start?"
"9399750","9403270"," It started down here, right?"
"9403390","9404650"," Major lows on Tesla."
"9407390","9415650"," So, coming back all the way over here in Tesla to right now pretend that we are back in time"
"9415650","9416590"," over here, okay?"
"9418890","9421730"," And you got people saying, so I'm long down here. "
"9421730","9422650"," This is where I'm long."
"9423010","9426370"," And you got, then we're driving up higher and people going, hey, Cap, can I take it along in here?"
"9426450","9427550"," Hey, Cap, can I take it along in here?"
"9427630","9428930"," And I'm like, why didn't you take it down there?"
"9430150","9430710"," Makes sense?"
"9431330","9432950"," Well, they're trying to start longs here."
"9433330","9435790"," And I tell them, fuck, no, you can't take it long here, buddy. "
"9436390","9437510"," And then it rips higher."
"9437990","9439990"," And they go, you were wrong, Cap, fuck you."
"9440130","9440570"," I made money. "
"9442050","9447210"," But they oftentimes are gambling and they have very high risk in those trades."
"9447790","9452130"," So, when we were coming down here, people are going, hey, Cap, can I take it along here?"
"9452210","9453350"," And I'm going, no, you can't."
"9453390","9456170"," You can do this day trade in here, day trades in here and stuff. "
"9456750","9458910"," But are we ready right here to take a trade?"
"9459170","9459310"," No."
"9460610","9465110"," Where am I looking to take that next trade or at least be able to test the waters is down"
"9465110","9465490"," here."
"9466170","9467850"," And we're almost there, aren't we?"
"9469010","9471530"," Now, currently we hit minus 27. "
"9473270","9476870"," We hit minus 27 right now, right now, minus 25."
"9478150","9481630"," And I'm always looking for like minus 25, minus 50, something like that."
"9482010","9484930"," Minus 25, I'm looking for a series of new hot or higher lows. "
"9485730","9487190"," We actually have some of that in here."
"9487310","9491670"," You can see it right in my cursor is there's a higher low and deli velocity right here."
"9493090","9494870"," Now, am I going full account here?"
"9495150","9500290"," Fuck no, but I am putting some risk on here on that, hitting that minus 25. "
"9501050","9504090"," Am I fully bullish here right now in Tesla?"
"9504390","9504970"," This is the turn."
"9505390","9505750"," Nope."
"9506890","9507410"," Nope. "
"9507750","9515290"," If anything, it would not shock me to see Tesla trade up here and come back down to get that"
"9515290","9517850"," minus 50 on daily velocity."
"9518970","9524670"," But there's a good shot at it here, at least on the first minus 25 that I got it."
"9524830","9526290"," And I want to put a little bit of exposure there. "
"9526290","9529830"," So I got some calls, I think they were weekly plus one day."
"9530930","9533370"," And what happened, right?"
"9534110","9537110"," I was actually very green right in here."
"9538390","9542690"," Now we didn't break out of our trend to the upside, right?"
"9543410","9544430"," But what's happening today?"
"9548380","9549940"," What can I see here today?"
"9550200","9554820"," We have the start of, we had a start of the turn around here, right?"
"9555680","9556540"," On the hourly trigger. "
"9557940","9562420"," We had a start of the turn around right here, came up, we actually blasted and then did not"
"9562420","9564020"," confirmation to get up there."
"9564400","9565440"," We had a confirmation right here."
"9565900","9568480"," There's one boom, boom, rocket ship. "
"9569640","9570080"," Boom."
"9571400","9573820"," And down underneath, whoop, hold on a minute here."
"9575040","9579380"," Turning up right now, a general trend of flattening of the hourly trigger. "
"9580340","9581500"," Looks like we want to go up here."
"9583540","9586040"," Am I getting all bold up here on Tesla?"
"9586460","9587020"," Fuck no."
"9587600","9590280"," Do I think that Tesla has the possibility to come up here?"
"9590400","9590620"," Yes. "
"9591580","9593640"," What are the two things that are telling me that?"
"9594420","9597160"," First one is this green line right here, that's vertical."
"9598800","9600180"," Now it's not so vertical."
"9601540","9603620"," And start in a flatten out. "
"9604460","9606840"," It's telling me there might be a local bottom here."
"9607140","9607380"," Might be."
"9608060","9609920"," We also have something going on above. "
"9609920","9614280"," We've got a cross of the daily, the weekly and the monthly."
"9615260","9618500"," When all this stuff comes in here, it's like a tractor beam."
"9619400","9622760"," For prices attracted to it, even if it's going to reject. "
"9625720","9630700"," So, for me at least, even if we go above this, I don't care."
"9630920","9632440"," I just care about this part of the trade."
"9633380","9635780"," I care about the flattening of the hourly velocity. "
"9636320","9639500"," And I think we have a pretty decent chance of squeezing higher."
"9640680","9641600"," 2233, 227."
"9642260","9643480"," So, I've got some risk on here. "
"9643840","9644780"," Am I all account here?"
"9644860","9645020"," No."
"9645780","9649660"," Am I calling for a turn in Tesla that we're going to go to the moon up here?"
"9649940","9650140"," No."
"9650540","9651800"," We don't have that proof yet. "
"9652720","9658940"," And we don't have any history of it like we do in previous history and Tesla."
"9659040","9659980"," We haven't hit minus 50."
"9661160","9661660"," You know what I'm saying?"
"9661660","9665060"," So, my thesis right now is we likely turn around to the upside. "
"9665380","9667280"," Try to trade this one more time above here."
"9668260","9673560"," Now, we are coming into an ER report, which can throw a big wrench into this where we just"
"9673560","9674580"," bloodbath to the downside."
"9675620","9677020"," I already know the banks aren't long. "
"9677340","9681340"," Tesla right now, they're long shit like Netflix, shit like NVDA."
"9682560","9686960"," As a matter of fact, Elon Musk came out and tried to hype up the AI train."
"9688760","9691180"," Let me see if I can, let me see if I can bring this up for you guys. "
"9691840","9692680"," Let me see if I can bring this up."
"9692880","9692980"," Fortune."
"9695620","9695940"," Tesla. "
"9696540","9697280"," Fortune magazine or something."
"9697580","9697940"," Fortune magazine."
"9702160","9702480"," Tesla. "
"9704840","9705160"," News."
"9708500","9709180"," And here we go."
"9710700","9711180"," Hold on. "
"9711200","9713940"," I'm going to, I have to put this in a, give me one quick second here."
"9715380","9715700"," Copy."
"9716660","9717660"," Give me one quick second here. "
"9722440","9723560"," Web page archive."
"9724800","9725860"," Post this in there."
"9727220","9728320"," Post this right there. "
"9731440","9732180"," Power Play."
"9732320","9734060"," Tesla give investors a painful shock."
"9738320","9740540"," I haven't covered Greg Tesla. "
"9740800","9741160"," Is this the one?"
"9741320","9743380"," Is this the wrong one?"
"9744460","9745340"," It's the wrong article."
"9745340","9748060"," Hold on a second here."
"9749200","9751240"," I'm going to get the one that just came out. "
"9753480","9755220"," The rules, I think this came out."
"9755600","9761110"," Joe, do you have the, where is this thing?"
"9762070","9763330"," I don't know where this article is."
"9763390","9764790"," I'll find this article for you at some point. "
"9765230","9771970"," But anyways, tests are, Elon's trying to push a narrative that AI FSD is going to be released here"
"9771970","9772550"," very shortly."
"9773250","9775030"," So, Elon is hoping for that."
"9776510","9779670"," That AI play on this ER, ER report. "
"9780230","9786170"," But in my view right now, unless he has something like that in his ER report today, I would not"
"9786170","9790930"," be shocked in knowing that the banks are not long the sticker."
"9791690","9792770"," I'm going to get over here."
"9794810","9798830"," Whatever this report is, I would like to see a rejection down here. "
"9798830","9802230"," So, when we get a good ER report, then the guidance is kind of mixed."
"9802610","9804490"," And we go down to the downside on Tesla."
"9805050","9809310"," We actually get the dip by after the 26th to long Tesla. "
"9809810","9812170"," I get my minus 50 on daily velocity."
"9814010","9818290"," I end up getting my initial great, great reaction to the upside right here."
"9818410","9818830"," Bam, right?"
"9819090","9819930"," We start to head down. "
"9820730","9822830"," We get this nice little curve up on the daily velocity."
"9823130","9825570"," Then we swing low into our daily velocity at minus 50."
"9825570","9828970"," And that's where you actually would have bought the dip on Tesla. "
"9829310","9833390"," If the market is going to roll or whatever in a week or two, that would fold right into an"
"9833390","9835410"," even more major low in Tesla too, right?"
"9836950","9840350"," So, that's the bearish ER thesis."
"9843910","9846090"," So, Joe Donut is posting this right now."
"9846210","9852970"," This is the FSD beta version 12 chat GPT moments for AI. "
"9854950","9858790"," Now, that could turn this stock up here."
"9859750","9862430"," Remember, market conditions could send us down as well."
"9862830","9865170"," Now, I want to show you one last cool thing here about Tesla. "
"9867330","9875370"," Regardless if we squeeze down to the downside, more blood or downside, or if we come up and reject"
"9875370","9879450"," to the downside, or if we even continue to go higher."
"9880590","9884150"," Regardless of any one of these three situations, okay?"
"9884830","9889770"," Regardless of the fourth situation, we trade sideways and then squeeze higher, right?"
"9889970","9895590"," If this is the actual bottom, because of some unknown news, that's positive, right?"
"9896250","9898250"," Or we bloodbath down, I don't fucking care."
"9898670","9900290"," But I can show you one cool thing. "
"9901870","9908830"," And we're going to show you something really cool here that is setting up right now."
"9910670","9916310"," And this is where you get people that say you could probably buy here."
"9916850","9918250"," Don't listen to Captain Jim James. "
"9918990","9921250"," You can likely buy here."
"9921710","9922730"," And why is that?"
"9922970","9924010"," I'm going to show you something cool."
"9926270","9928010"," So, this is Tesla on a daily basis. "
"9928690","9931090"," We're going to kick out this volume here, get rid of this."
"9932070","9934090"," I want to show you something really cool here, okay?"
"9935270","9936190"," So, here's Tesla."
"9937830","9940530"," Now, I'm going to compare this to the S&P 500. "
"9940790","9944390"," You can compare it to Spooze."
"9945010","9947210"," I think it's the same price and scale."
"9948750","9949930"," That one kind of sucks. "
"9951670","9952330"," Hold on here."
"9953010","9953710"," New price scale."
"9954490","9955270"," That might show up better. "
"9956390","9957830"," This might have a better way of showing it."
"9960630","9961990"," This is a good way to show this."
"9964190","9970190"," Whenever we have a major divergence in price on Tesla and spy. "
"9970730","9972870"," Listen closely gang, especially Tesla gang."
"9973630","9978790"," Whenever we have a huge divergence in Tesla and spy, here's an example, right?"
"9979230","9980210"," We're going to have that right now, right?"
"9980990","9981550"," There's the party."
"9982590","9983690"," And here's Tesla. "
"9984890","9986090"," Diverging, right?"
"9986510","9988030"," Price going up, going down."
"9989110","9990830"," Let's look at some prior examples."
"9991790","9992850"," Divergence in price. "
"9994190","9995230"," Divergence in price."
"9996450","9998570"," So, let's say we're right here right now."
"9999790","10005910"," It's even if we get the bloodbath, we have a major swing up where we come more in line with"
"10005910","10009450"," price on S&P 500, even when it rolls over. "
"10009830","10010250"," See that?"
"10011610","10015390"," So, we have a divergence in price situation going on right now."
"10016610","10018230"," Here's the last one right here."
"10018590","10019510"," Divergence in price. "
"10020630","10021610"," Divergence in price."
"10021810","10023590"," Let's pretend we have a bad ER."
"10024850","10027930"," And I'm telling you, wait for this right here right now, right?"
"10028290","10029390"," You don't actually have to. "
"10029470","10031770"," You could actually probably take one."
"10032150","10033010"," Divergence, divergence."
"10035030","10036070"," Divergence, right?"
"10036490","10036910"," Divergence. "
"10037570","10039310"," We come back, right?"
"10040250","10041690"," To meet up with price up here."
"10041910","10042670"," Same thing right here."
"10043670","10043690"," Right?"
"10043910","10044130"," Bloodbath. "
"10044770","10048330"," We eventually come back in line price right here, right?"
"10048330","10049470"," Back in line again."
"10049810","10051090"," It's a major swing high."
"10052050","10057690"," And you can see examples of this over and over and over again. "
"10057970","10062610"," And then Tesla swings violently straight up to match price."
"10062950","10064110"," Another divergence in price."
"10064550","10067570"," Price is generally going up and then boom, swing high again. "
"10068470","10071650"," So, all that bearishness gets resolved at some point."
"10072670","10074990"," So, right now we have this big divergence in price."
"10074990","10084990"," This is either going to resolve on this ER to match price on S&P 500 fast, like rip"
"10084990","10092740"," uncontrollably or we bloodbath down. "
"10092900","10098200"," But even if we do, it's still going to violently match back up with this price above, at least"
"10098200","10100040"," historically on Tesla."
"10101220","10105330"," So, if you want to take a spread on Tesla for this ER today, date it out three or four"
"10105330","10111430"," months or something or three months to monetize in a month or two weeks, even if the trade goes"
"10111430","10116830"," against you, history is on your side that you would eventually get paid here."
"10117730","10119130"," Does that make sense to you?"
"10120330","10126190"," This divergence, even if we blood down, let's say you buy a Tesla call spread a month and a half"
"10126190","10130630"," out, three months out, put some time on it, and we have a bad ER. "
"10130630","10137290"," And you paid five bucks, five dollars per contract, right?"
"10138030","10139590"," Now it's worth a dollar."
"10140070","10141950"," It's five bucks that pays you ten bucks."
"10142810","10144070"," Now it's worth a dollar. "
"10144850","10147090"," There's a high probability it's going to swing back up here."
"10148010","10153010"," And that you'll see though your five dollar contract go to a dollar, come back to five, and then"
"10153010","10154290"," actually pay you that ten bucks."
"10155230","10157850"," Or you're going to get paid this right now to the upside. "
"10159130","10162710"," Does any of that make sense to you?"
"10163530","10166130"," You're in the chat, let me know if that makes sense to you."
"10167090","10176270"," So even with all this bearishness that I have, even with all this bearishness that I have today, I"
"10176270","10182230"," don't have bearishness, I think we can easily trade 232 to 235 in this ER."
"10186690","10193010"," Even with all this bearishness that I have, I'm going to close that up for you. "
"10194550","10201010"," Even those bearishness that I have on Tesla into their ER, at this point heading into their ER,"
"10201610","10204070"," could there be better positioning long?"
"10204670","10204770"," Yes."
"10206070","10208150"," Is there risk to going long here?"
"10208530","10208670"," Yes."
"10209890","10212350"," A call spread would likely be safer. "
"10213810","10218690"," But if you don't want to miss that stuff, if you don't want to miss that move, and you want"
"10218690","10222250"," to get in now, a call spread seems rational."
"10223310","10230210"," Even if we swing low, you likely, if you were to take a call spread today on Tesla, and if"
"10230210","10239750"," the trade goes against you on their ER, history would tell you to not fucking close that trade to"
"10239750","10240570"," just hold it."
"10241410","10249350"," Because whatever that capitulation move is likely going to swing back higher again, and meet up"
"10249350","10253110"," with spoos or spy by the end of earning season before we sell. "
"10260840","10261940"," It's full porting."
"10268680","10271200"," You guys are fucking full porting right now, Cap."
"10273380","10274720"," Are we still rotating?"
"10275080","10276640"," Are these things still rotating right now?"
"10278890","10284670"," I hope that we are bouncing between SPX queues and so you guys can see the. "
"10289530","10290070"," Okay."
"10290370","10292390"," So you guys are grasping this concept, right?"
"10295290","10301410"," If you're if you're to be an aggressive bull right now, I would say a one and a half to"
"10301410","10302370"," three month call spread."
"10304490","10307570"," And you would start there heading into ER. "
"10309170","10314390"," If the ER goes against you, I would not close that call spread."
"10314810","10316630"," I don't care if it's worth a fucking penny."
"10316650","10321830"," You hold that fucker until it swings high again because history tells you it's going to. "
"10322850","10328010"," Now let's say you're in that call spread and they have a great report and it just starts"
"10328010","10329510"," relentlessly trading the upside."
"10330150","10335150"," You leave that call keep that call spread until it monetizes and you fucking day trade and weekly"
"10335150","10338110"," trade to two thirty five."
"10338810","10345670"," Look for the rejection and then reenter again on the hourly trigger and try to watch Tesla move"
"10345670","10349410"," higher and relentlessly for a week or two or three weeks or whatever that is. "
"10352380","10354820"," And and in that structure."
"10355760","10360920"," All the risk is on a seller and not a buyer or your probability of winning."
"10361560","10365640"," Is better on the buy side down here than it is on the sell side. "
"10366020","10369140"," Like before it happens, not knowing the future."
"10369200","10375080"," No crystal ball heading into this heading into this Tesla close today to this Tesla ER."
"10376000","10385160"," You are better served or you have a higher probability of being profitable in a call spread than"
"10385160","10389580"," you are short or inputs or put spreads. "
"10389600","10396920"," You have the most probability of getting a print knowing the history of Tesla and how it trades."
"10404910","10406930"," You guys understand what I'm saying by that?"
"10406930","10409910"," It doesn't."
"10410330","10412090"," It does not affect spy. "
"10412790","10416010"," I just showed you you watch like Tesla will be like mooning."
"10417010","10417610"," Right?"
"10417970","10424470"," So like Tesla is like mooning and you see this violent swing up from Tesla to catch up to spy."
"10425370","10426210"," Does that make sense?"
"10426870","10429670"," It's like spy is like already done its moon mission. "
"10430130","10430450"," It's done."
"10431310","10436270"," And then you see this swing up where where Tesla comes back in line with the market."
"10437510","10439350"," That's the whole thesis behind this. "
"10439750","10441190"," That's why it doesn't matter."
"10441830","10443910"," It's not like Tesla swings down."
"10444870","10450490"," And as it swings back up to catch up to spy that spy just like goes up another 10 or"
"10450490","10451010"," 20%. "
"10451830","10453450"," Spy kind of like stalls."
"10454710","10457050"," It's kind of like a like a boomerang."
"10457770","10458210"," Right?"
"10458490","10459570"," Like I throw the boomerang. "
"10459650","10461630"," So I'm walking with you or I'm walking."
"10461990","10463970"," I throw the boomerang behind me."
"10463970","10467190"," And I keep walking at a slow pace. "
"10467910","10472430"," The boomerangs now like flying behind me and I'm making all this progress."
"10473010","10479810"," And then that boomerang flies back at a faster rate and then eventually catches back up to my hand"
"10479810","10481690"," and we're equal again."
"10482710","10490790"," So divergence in price resolves on Tesla eventually to match again. "
"10492470","10492870"," Yeah."
"10493110","10493410"," Cool, cool."
"10493690","10494790"," You guys got that right now. "
"10501520","10502660"," What is my take on?"
"10502820","10505320"," I don't know if you have spoons and the X taking a breather next month."
"10505520","10506180"," Well, let's look at that."
"10506460","10516800"," So whether regardless of how we trade into the 31st, even if we're up right now, I"
"10516800","10521040"," am expecting us to trade heavy and hard up until February 14th. "
"10521040","10526920"," And I am still expecting our season are yearly low in mid March and into April."
"10526940","10530920"," Either of those two dates every year we get them, even in bull markets."
"10531080","10536060"," We get a nice fat yearly low in not every year, but we're in a bear market. "
"10536060","10536720"," We don't."
"10536840","10543240"," But even so, like that March, April is the time to enter the market normally for longs for the"
"10543240","10543440"," year."
"10544100","10546000"," That's what all the CTA is doing all out of the shit. "
"10546160","10547760"," They wait for that one big sexy moment."
"10550670","10551990"," You can play zero dates."
"10552210","10553090"," And that's another thing too. "
"10553250","10554690"," Rocket certain said stop playing zero days."
"10554990","10556350"," You guys can play zero dates."
"10556630","10558090"," Just think about the context. "
"10558770","10561130"," Think about the context of what you're trading."
"10562250","10565830"," You can trade zero dates as long as it's not your only plan."
"10566830","10567730"," Does that make sense?"
"10568770","10571130"," Zero dates do a couple really good things for you. "
"10571430","10574230"," I want to talk about this because to this other."
"10574390","10576870"," I want to talk about the positive aspects of zero dates."
"10576870","10581470"," Because I often on Twitter, I hear people just shit on it. "
"10582770","10585290"," Zero dates are great to count builders."
"10586330","10587590"," They're great for trend days."
"10588410","10591030"," They're great to teach you how to trade with low risk. "
"10591750","10597370"," I have to make a comment about this because it really burned my ass on Twitter sometimes."
"10597610","10600790"," And I keep my mouth shut on this because I hear people talking and they don't know what the fuck"
"10600790","10601570"," they're talking about."
"10602010","10605230"," I'm not going to name names, but I'm going to be quite frank on this. "
"10605230","10610850"," These are people often times that spend a lot of time trading futures."
"10612030","10621710"," It is as risky as trading futures and in the same time less risky than trading"
"10621710","10622110"," futures."
"10622950","10626730"," You have defined risk in trading zero dates. "
"10628090","10633710"," You have amplified winnings which you don't have in weeklies or monthlies."
"10634830","10637050"," It's a defined length of art."
"10637090","10642470"," It's defined in the direction of the trade because there's no intrinsic value in zero dates. "
"10643030","10644230"," And you have defined losses."
"10645230","10648830"," You know what people don't tell you that trade futures?"
"10649910","10656190"," About the times when the trade really goes against them and it doesn't come back."
"10656870","10662730"," When you get a fucking margin maintenance call, when you're fucking brokerage, it takes your closes"
"10662730","10669630"," your goddamn position and starts to trade against you to pay them back that margin that you took. "
"10671310","10676050"," I often hear people say some really fucking bad shit."
"10678370","10681470"," You shouldn't be trading zero dates or trading this or trading that."
"10681910","10687870"," That shit can be way more damaging to you, taking margin on futures and globe x trading. "
"10687870","10691690"," Another problem here too or another good thing here is you have defined risk."
"10692690","10695690"," Another good thing about zero dates is you're not trading size."
"10696130","10701610"," It's not like buying a Tesla call for fucking fifteen dollars or a fucking Netflix call for five"
"10701610","10701850"," bucks. "
"10702030","10703150"," You're trading twenty cents."
"10704530","10706090"," Easy barrier to entry."
"10706350","10710270"," If you don't think I'm telling the truth here, then why the fuck are all these hedge funds?"
"10710670","10712530"," Why the fuck are dealers hedge funds?"
"10712530","10713530"," Thanks. "
"10714950","10718610"," Pegging in the market right now with zero-day puts because they're cheap."
"10719250","10723270"," If we go up to with three dollars in spy, they're making money regardless."
"10723910","10724730"," They're long the market. "
"10724970","10725910"," They're buying zero-day puts."
"10726370","10731390"," It's cheaper for them to hedge directly with a zero-date in a risky environment."
"10732590","10736230"," They're not fucking, they're not out there fucking selling fucking futures. "
"10736590","10740130"," They're fucking buying zero-day puts because it's cheap."
"10740130","10744290"," And the risk is defined for owning the underlying in the market."
"10745010","10751490"," So when you hear people out there saying if zero dates are bad, yeah, they can be for some people. "
"10751710","10754170"," There are degenerate gamblers that are attracted to them."
"10754890","10757770"," But there's some great qualities to zero dates."
"10758150","10761910"," Time, I don't have to wait a week to get paid 100%. "
"10763690","10768370"," So I'm not in a weekly or a monthly call that's costing me two or three fucking dollars."
"10769250","10770290"," Five dollars."
"10771310","10779030"," I can make that 20 cent trade fucking 20 times to get that 5000% print. "
"10780410","10780930"," Right."
"10781230","10784530"," I don't have the risk of being margin called."
"10785090","10789970"," I don't have to wait for the market to go against me like risk and time in market. "
"10790270","10794190"," Like I'm here for a week and a half waiting for this and then all of a sudden I get"
"10794190","10794850"," a bloodbath."
"10794850","10799530"," And those calls are fucked anyways because I've been sitting in them for three or four or five"
"10799530","10800050"," days."
"10800370","10800930"," Right. "
"10805650","10809430"," And here's the last part of zero dates."
"10810070","10812950"," This is the what I think is the best part of zero dates."
"10813650","10817270"," When you're trading, you're learning how to become a better trader. "
"10818050","10820150"," A better trader or investor."
"10821070","10826410"," The cost of entry with real money is cheapest with zero dates."
"10827590","10832190"," And all of this stuff is valid on higher time frames. "
"10832930","10836110"," So if you're trading a zero date on a one minute time frame."
"10836890","10837210"," Right."
"10837490","10842990"," And you were to go from a zero date to a weekly call on a 15 minute time frame or"
"10842990","10847030"," a monthly call on a 30 minute time frame. "
"10847030","10850490"," It's all scalable at a much cheaper price."
"10851810","10859510"," So if you're sitting there trading zero dates every day with me and I think she came to Viking"
"10859510","10862050"," Princess that she trades one contract."
"10862810","10864470"," She's got exposure to the market. "
"10865150","10869270"," She's not blowing up her account and she's actually trading real money."
"10869910","10875830"," And I can assure you that the more time you have trading zero dates, it's cheaply 10 cent, 20 cent,"
"10875970","10876270"," whatever."
"10877410","10881290"," You learn everything about, you learn tons about Greeks. "
"10881830","10883870"," You learn about premium IV."
"10884910","10886630"," You have real money on the line."
"10886870","10889530"," So you have that same mentality of winning and losing. "
"10890750","10897370"," Your exposure is low and you have time and market time and market."
"10899430","10905070"," And any trader that has time and markets will tell you that you become a better trader over time"
"10905070","10906250"," time and market."
"10906810","10913010"," So if you're in here trading zero dates for three months daily, every day, the good days, the bad"
"10913010","10915410"," days, the best setups, the worst setups. "
"10915810","10922750"," I assure you that you get an understanding of how the market works on a one minute basis that you"
"10922750","10924530"," can apply on any time frame."
"10926330","10928110"," Does that make sense to you guys out there?"
"10929210","10930810"," I hear that argument out there."
"10931430","10936810"," And I sit on my hands on it a lot of times and they're just angry that they're not successful. "
"10937450","10938370"," I'll be honest with you."
"10939370","10943190"," And if you do this enough, you will be successful trading zero dates."
"10943390","10945350"," Now I'm not going to say or I'm not going to say I shouldn't say that. "
"10945810","10949730"," This is not financial advice and this is not true for most people."
"10949730","10953750"," But I'm telling you, anyone that tells you can't make money on zero dates, they're out of their"
"10953750","10954450"," fucking mind."
"10955170","10959430"," You lose enough and do it enough, you will become successful trading zero dates. "
"10960030","10961570"," None, but maybe not all the time."
"10961730","10966630"," But if you are successful most of the time and you take and you remove those winnings out of the"
"10966630","10968330"," markets in a responsible fashion."
"10968870","10972650"," But yes, you can be a successful zero day trader, but you have to do a bunch of other shit"
"10972650","10975750"," responsibly along the way to get there. "
"10979530","10986850"," And you can apply this experience to more safe trading in your trading tool chest that you have out"
"10986850","10987090"," there."
"10987190","10990610"," So anyone that's out there telling you that they're like, don't ever just zero date trading."
"10990830","10993610"," I know that's a mantra on Twitter right now, on fin twit. "
"10994270","10994610"," They're wrong."
"10995230","10996410"," They don't the fuck they're talking about."
"10996850","11002070"," And they set up a lot of motherfuckers out there to get margin called and margin maintenance,"
"11002070","11005090"," whatever you want to call it or whatever version of it is the poor you. "
"11005090","11008070"," But you don't hear from those people ever again."
"11008190","11009890"," They lock your fucking account and you're gone."
"11010450","11012370"," And you know what you're on the hook for in that shit?"
"11012790","11013410"," 100,000. "
"11015070","11016030"," 150,000."
"11016970","11017930"," 200,000."
"11018730","11020370"," You're not on the hook for a grand. "
"11020970","11023670"," You're not on the hook for fucking 500 bucks."
"11024790","11025110"," Three grand."
"11026710","11028210"," You're out there maxing out fucking margin. "
"11028610","11030190"," You think you're trading a futures contract."
"11030330","11033050"," You have no fucking idea that you're actually trading size."
"11033050","11036270"," Like literal size for 700 bucks a day. "
"11036870","11037990"," 500 bucks a day."
"11038790","11039830"," 1000 bucks a day."
"11043120","11044200"," I'm trading size. "
"11044580","11045880"," They're trading 20 cent calls."
"11046300","11046900"," I'll tell you what."
"11047540","11052900"," You're also risking thousands of dollars that that fucking zero day trader is not. "
"11054480","11057240"," And that zero day trader easily turns."
"11058420","11062780"," 1000 bucks into three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten."
"11063580","11064920"," One trade for the week. "
"11066680","11068760"," A zero day trader could take one trade."
"11069460","11071780"," Successful trade a week and blow out."
"11072780","11081760"," Fuck tons of blowbacks futures traders that have to trade day in, day out, five days a week. "
"11083280","11087220"," To make 700,000 bucks, whatever it is, day in, day out."
"11090080","11090560"," Sorry."
"11091180","11091540"," That's a rant. "
"11091760","11092760"," I'll stop getting angry here."
"11096680","11097460"," Hey, Stacy."
"11113750","11114190"," Yeah. "
"11117250","11118890"," I'm going to tell you guys something."
"11120370","11122610"," Training with you guys zero dates, day in, day out."
"11122770","11127930"," My wins went down or my percentage of wins or my day or my zero day trading has gone down. "
"11128130","11128750"," My percentage of wins."
"11128750","11131550"," But that's because you guys put me in the fucking meat grinder."
"11132070","11138970"," But along the way, guess what I've become a way better trader way, way, way better trader. "
"11139330","11145090"," If I wasn't streaming and trading with you guys live here, it'd be, it'd be fucking nasty."
"11146030","11149770"," It'd be not like just taking the choice of setups, nasty trader."
"11153260","11153660"," Yeah. "
"11153800","11153940"," Bork."
"11154160","11154560"," Bork."
"11154940","11155340"," Bork. "
"11155440","11156160"," You said wins down."
"11156760","11157180"," But up."
"11160720","11161380"," Green man. "
"11161520","11162140"," I don't know why this is."
"11162300","11163980"," I'm not getting the rotation here."
"11164060","11164860"," I'm just stuck on. "
"11165080","11167460"," I don't know what's going on here."
"11168040","11169580"," I don't have to reset this maybe."
"11174800","11183900"," For some reason we're not rotating between, maybe I got to click these on and off. "
"11187850","11189970"," We're not getting rotation these things."
"11190330","11190950"," There's SPX."
"11191950","11192510"," SPX. "
"11192910","11193470"," Here's a Tesla."
"11201990","11203530"," Here comes my money, man."
"11203730","11205150"," Give me my money on Tesla, baby. "
"11207030","11208490"," Tesla SPX queues."
"11210970","11214130"," This, this screen should be rotating between three different screeners."
"11214970","11216570"," It's not quite doing that yet. "
"11221500","11222920"," Let's go back to SPX."
"11223340","11224740"," We'll get SPX, baby."
"11227560","11229460"," Talk to this morning about turning. "
"11229860","11230680"," We talked this morning."
"11230880","11231900"," So look below here."
"11232680","11235420"," Talk to this morning about what's on a 30 minute basis. "
"11238280","11239440"," Talk to this morning."
"11242700","11247970"," Talk to this morning about buying it."
"11248150","11248630"," Wait a minute. "
"11248770","11249490"," Oh, now we're flipping."
"11249490","11250030"," Now we're flipping."
"11250850","11252270"," Either buying a dip on the screen. "
"11252450","11260550"," This is your buy the dip down here or establishing a base where we can change this yellow color to"
"11260550","11260930"," green."
"11264670","11266830"," This is actually your buy the dip down here right here."
"11267290","11268370"," I don't know why it's so high. "
"11269610","11271290"," Go back to a one minute basis on SPX."
"11273250","11274070"," This will be cleaner."
"11278270","11280930"," Your buy the dip is right currently down at 4860. "
"11281910","11287790"," Price right now on SPX trying to do the same thing that it did yesterday, the day before, the day"
"11287790","11293750"," before, the day before comes up into a new level, establishes a base base camp right, we call it,"
"11293950","11295650"," trying to attack that next level."
"11296290","11297530"," We're going to switch this."
"11297890","11307010"," We're going to switch this yellow now to green as it's trying to establish some sort of a, of a"
"11307010","11307890"," consolidation. "
"11308490","11309050"," Goddamn it."
"11309330","11310370"," Just switch back up there."
"11311590","11317850"," Trying to grind up here and sit on this 4900 so we can make an attack above to that next"
"11317850","11321210"," level above, which we have at, well, I'm going to close this. "
"11323690","11325890"," And 4910, we've got 43 million."
"11328530","11330610"," 4925, we've got 47 million."
"11331130","11332650"," And then we get the big boy up here. "
"11333510","11339690"," We have the big, the target above of 4950 on SPX."
"11341030","11342050"," We'll lower this down."
"11342230","11349310"," You guys need, you guys need the gamma more than you need the, let me see if that works right"
"11349310","11349590"," there. "
"11350250","11350730"," That should be good."
"11351970","11354070"," Where's the thing that says SPX gamma?"
"11356850","11360730"," Keep blue, it keeps like, every time I switch from one minute to 30 minute."
"11360730","11364190"," It, it, it disappears. "
"11375050","11382050"," No, no, no, uh, I'm going to do this quickly before it switches."
"11386690","11389050"," Leave that right there so you can see it before we switch."
"11390050","11391570"," We're going to make a jump to the next one. "
"11392870","11397030"," Can we grind up here and slam into that?"
"11397250","11401310"," I would really like to see us tag this one up here, this STX cell up here."
"11401350","11404270"," I'd really like to see us trade 4938 if possible."
"11405670","11418080"," And we'll"
"11418080","11419020"," write cell up here. "
"11426220","11427840"," We'll see if that works out."
"11440150","11442150"," How come I not taking any spy trades?"
"11442790","11444970"," So I'm trying to launch a website right now."
"11445130","11447630"," I have calls coming in all morning for meetings. "
"11449470","11450630"," At indiscriminate times."
"11451110","11456530"," So if I take a zero date trade right now today and I have a call phone call for a"
"11456530","11456870"," meeting."
"11457330","11459450"," And I am upside down on that tray. "
"11459590","11462330"," Let's say, let's say I buy it for a dollar and I'm down 90 cents."
"11463010","11465110"," I would have to take the L on that."
"11465190","11468530"," Let's say it's down to 90 cents and I take the L on that trade and then get into a"
"11468530","11469150"," meeting. "
"11470370","11472670"," And I'm working on discord as well in the background."
"11473010","11476430"," So we're trying to launch on the 31st and it's required of me that I'm a."
"11477210","11480250"," Available to other people behind the scenes here."
"11481210","11482430"," Good question, Hello, hey. "
"11500410","11502270"," All right, I'll be back with you guys in a little bit."
"11503790","11505730"," I'm going to turn on a CNBC again for you."
"11510030","11512770"," But hello, hey, don't hesitate to ask anybody in the stream. "
"11512950","11526370"," They'll talk to"
"11529350","11529510"," you."
"11530270","11531790"," Zero dollars from the third."
"11536210","11540830"," The app today. "
"11541630","11542790"," It's pretty loud, right?"
"11546110","11549590"," No, it's not too loud, is it?"
"11554610","11555090"," Spidey."
"11555250","11556010"," Hey, it's commutative."
"11556150","11557330"," Don't join just now. "
"11557450","11558630"," So Michael's good to see you."
"11558730","11562230"," I mean, how do you build a case for S&P 4900?"
"11562230","11565330"," Well, Netflix beats PMI's beat."
"11565970","11567670"," Microsoft goes to three trill. "
"11568050","11569830"," So you get 4900 on the S&P."
"11569950","11570930"," Good news is good news."
"11571270","11573510"," Bullard maybe yesterday helped a bit too. "
"11573710","11573950"," Right."
"11574130","11575370"," So that's the formula."
"11575850","11577090"," It's working right now. "
"11577110","11581850"," It's interesting that Netflix ends up being this little bit of a spark when I was saying before."
"11582130","11585790"," It's not really shouldn't have coattails on other businesses."
"11585790","11590830"," It's just like, wow, we have a lot of these dominant digital businesses that really sort of control"
"11590830","11593810"," their domain and we might as well buy all of them at this point. "
"11593810","11595470"," So it's looking a little bit chasey."
"11595610","11600010"," I think maybe the market at some point goes looking for something to worry about incrementally."
"11600210","11602330"," We are in a very comfortable zone macro-wise. "
"11602690","11609330"," I don't think that the soft landing premise is going to be disturbed anytime soon, even by a number"
"11609330","11613830"," that looks like it's a little bit unfriendly because we have had this accumulation of evidence that"
"11613830","11614350"," it looks okay."
"11614490","11615530"," So I think it's fine."
"11615730","11617030"," It's more about short-term tactics. "
"11617470","11619930"," The average strategist target for the end of the year."
"11619930","11621690"," One other note here too as well."
"11621690","11626590"," If you are following me on the Tesla trade, if I close it, I will let you know. "
"11628790","11634470"," You're going to have to find other reasons why this is a good overbought condition and can continue"
"11634470","11634790"," higher."
"11635510","11642030"," Tesla, you know, just given the landscape of where we are, doesn't seem today to have the"
"11642030","11648470"," importance that maybe in the past it has to where the market might go, especially NAS 100 stocks."
"11648470","11655390"," It's no longer really where the energy is in terms of what is, you know, where animal spirits are"
"11655390","11655650"," flowing. "
"11656210","11657710"," The stock's dead money for three years."
"11658190","11664030"," December of 2020, I think it was in this basic zone in terms of price."
"11664570","11668270"," Yeah, it's kind of oscillated around, but I don't think the market needs it. "
"11668590","11669930"," It's a little bit of an outlier."
"11670470","11674410"," And just to heads up, that Tesla trade was at 65 cents."
"11674630","11820210"," It's now trading $1.13. So"
"11820210","11824370"," in 10 minutes time now at the top of the hour, the US is due to sell. "
"11826670","11831510"," The US is selling a five year note here at the top of the hour, $61 billion worth."
"11832310","11834050"," The private cover was two spot five."

"11838530","11840330"," Looking at a preview ahead of this auction here."
"11840830","11846150"," So given the recent backdrop in yields and improved technical backdrop, the JP Morgan strategists"
"11846150","11848550"," see the auction as being well digested."
"11848890","11853790"," Despite its record matching size at $3 billion larger as well than last month. "
"11854470","11860130"," So primary dealers positions in the three to six year sector net long 54 spot $3 billion in the"
"11860130","11865310"," week ending January 10th higher than the 38 spot $3 billion average over the past year."

"12359620","12365520"," So we're shortly expecting the results of the US five year note sale, the pre sale when issued when"

"13455590","13464230"," trade sideways and down on spy and sideways on cues during ER season. "
"13466930","13471330"," That doesn't mean we don't have nice lows, nice highs to sell and nice lows to buy."
"13476050","13480530"," And then we get the major rip on the thirty first and to the fifteen."
"13482230","13486350"," So I actually still believe in this trade to the downside, the spooze trade. "
"13486730","13488230"," I actually have more faith in that one printing."

"13591590","13593150"," Like necessarily bearish. "
"13593470","13595330"," It's more digestion and solidation."
"13600010","13601550"," My bearishness is more neutral."
"13604010","13607890"," Even my bearishness into the thirty first is more neutral than it is. "
"13608490","13609810"," True bearishness."
"13610430","13615950"," More like sideways and slightly down in spy and sideways on cues."

"13689230","13692310"," We've even had gamma at five thousand like two months."
"13693170","13694390"," Forty eight hundred has been hanging out. "

"13712570","13715770"," And also the JPM callers up there at fifty two hundred. "
"13716010","13718570"," So I don't think fifty two hundred is out of."
"13719870","13722670"," Out of reach between now and mid February."
"13725280","13729180"," And if some things happen correctly six thousand is possible. "
"13729960","13732420"," I doubt it but six thousand is possible."

"13750850","13754350"," You know one problem here is I'm not expecting too much downside like that."
"13754510","13756110"," If I get just this I'd be happy. "
"13758700","13759320"," You know."
"13760120","13761660"," There's no volatility in this market."
"13780280","13781460"," I should probably move this over. "
"13782000","13785020"," I was probably doing a low volatility market."
"13785020","13786900"," It's going to take you all day to get there."
"13786900","13787380"," How about that. "

"14578080","14581800"," signature bank would have been about $19.9 million. "
"14582080","14584620"," So after taxing would have been about $111 million."
"14585060","14586340"," I think it was a quarter."
"14586640","14587600"," I'm very interested. "
"14587780","14591700"," You have like 285 full service banking operations."
"14592440","14596220"," Of which I guess 90% are in Texas."
"14596760","14599620"," The Texas economy is doing pretty doggone good, isn't it?"
"14599720","14601720"," And so your bank ought to be doing great. "
"14603040","14604780"," The economy is doing good."
"14606040","14612460"," Obviously interest rates going up with the fed raising interest rates that it has impacted the loan"
"14612460","14614220"," volume a little bit."
"14614560","14620000"," On the other hand, the economic activity and the job growth still remains extremely solid. "
"14620140","14623160"," So a very good economy, no question about it."
"14623260","14626540"," So that was that was one of the things I wanted to point to."
"14626660","14631480"," And that is that I guess, is it a loan volume or is it either the number of loans or"
"14631480","14634180"," the amount of loans down a little bit?"
"14634180","14637080"," Just a note here that we have opened a poll. "
"14638100","14641540"," How will Tesla open tomorrow after ER?"
"14642460","14645200"," You use the exclamation point."
"14647060","14652060"," Vote and then green red or flat."
"14656520","14665600"," Out of the out of the. "
"14665600","14667940"," Fucking Joe Donut out there."
"14668960","14670740"," Don't trust Joe Donut."
"14671060","14672920"," He's part of that Tesla gang. "
"14675120","14677740"," God damn fucking Tesla gang."
"14679620","14681420"," Oh, I always like."
"14686340","14687000"," Whatever. "
"14687420","14689000"," Whatever I like bottoms."
"14689200","14692180"," I'm like, I, whatever at bottoms or near bottoms, I'm like."
"14692840","14695440"," I'm like, I fucking hate Tesla Q."
"14696460","14700640"," And then whenever we're at tops on Tesla, I'm like, God damn Tesla bulls. "
"14703000","14710620"," Like Tesla, like that, like Tesla bulls are unbearable on tops and Tesla Q is unbearable at"
"14710620","14711100"," bottoms."
"14714360","14716100"," Joey D, baby."
"14717720","14720000"," Joey Donut in the house representing. "
"14723380","14726160"," I basically have a big smile on his face right now."
"14733420","14734720"," I'm just ribbon brother."
"14739040","14743200"," We actually ran this poll so I could start muting all the Tesla bulls. "
"14747240","14750000"," By the way, I am long Tesla to this close."
"14751220","14752880"," So I guess then one of the Tesla bulls."
"14762980","14764300"," I just banned myself. "
"14764940","14765960"," I'm going to go in the corner."
"14792430","14793390"," Thanks for having me."
"14793490","14794110"," Oh, well, have you back. "
"14794330","14795090"," Thank you very much."
"14795090","14796370"," Love to go to a touch base here."
"14796630","14798790"," Let's turn now to OFG bank core. "
"14798870","14802230"," It also beat on the bottom line boosted by higher loan growth lower expenses."
"14802710","14803390"," That'll happen."
"14803610","14807810"," You know, you get a better, better results when the loan growth is high and the expenses are down. "
"14808350","14809650"," Shares higher by about two percent."
"14809910","14816430"," Jose Rafael Fernandez is vice chair and CEO of OFG Bank Court and also the Community Banker of the"
"14816430","14818310"," Year in the most recent year."
"14818470","14819830"," Congratulations on that accolade. "
"14819930","14820510"," You deserve it."
"14820670","14820990"," I'm sure."
"14821430","14821750"," Way to go. "
"14822130","14822650"," Thank you."
"14822850","14823450"," Thank you, Tyler."

"14824430","14825330"," Glad to have you here."
"14825870","14827090"," What's clicking for you?"
"14828490","14830770"," So we've been very fortunate."
"14831450","14834250"," Puerto Rico's economy has been doing very well. "
"14834250","14841390"," We have grown our loans very steadily, thanks to a very good environment in the island."
"14841930","14848370"," But more importantly, I think growth comes from us being very intentional about investing in"
"14848370","14850550"," technology, investing in our people."
"14851170","14856290"," And for the last three or four years, we have leveraged technology to bring into our markets"
"14856290","14858530"," leadership in terms of technology. "
"14859290","14862770"," And that has definitely made a difference in the experience of technology."
"14862770","14867550"," And particularly on the commercial side of the equation, we have been doing some good growth."
"14867810","14873370"," Puerto Rico's recovery economic activity index up about six percent year over year through November"
"14873370","14877730"," of 2023, you have steered this bank for a long time, right?"
"14877970","14880330"," About 20 years, 1920 years as CEO. "
"14881270","14886470"," You've seen the good and you have seen truly challenging times in your, in the Commonwealth."
"14887250","14893410"," How did you lead this bank through those difficult times, through the periods of real economic"
"14893410","14897950"," dislocation and pain for many of the communities and customers you serve?"
"14898950","14902090"," So the word I use is being opportunistic."
"14902410","14909410"," We, at OFG, we, we, 10, 20 years ago, we were a small one billion dollar bank and we had"
"14909410","14911190"," pretty good capital base. "
"14911670","14914230"," We leveraged that capital to buy and be acquisitive."
"14914450","14915810"," We bought a failed bank in 2010."
"14916630","14922290"," We then acquired two international banks operating in 2019. "
"14923430","14928130"," So we've been, so we became the third largest bank in the island and we were leaders in"
"14928130","14928630"," consolidation."
"14929210","14930270"," So that, that helped us tremendously."
"14931070","14936910"," Now we are doing the blocking and tackling and we're doing the organic growth as we have the"
"14936910","14937490"," critical mass. "
"14937750","14943510"," We have 42 branches in the island leveraging, as I mentioned, with technology and all that has just"
"14943510","14949130"," allowed us to grow our customer base, have increased critical mass and market share."
"14949130","14957150"," So, yeah, 20, 20 years of which 17 were a downturn, but we, we deployed our capital, we managed our"
"14957150","14961670"," capital very effectively and now we're reaping the benefits."
"14961830","14963490"," Where is the loan growth coming from?"
"14963690","14964290"," Is it small businesses?"
"14964630","14965470"," Is it mortgage lending?"
"14965810","14966350"," What kind of lending?"
"14967510","14973050"," Particularly on the commercials, small and mid-sized companies and also on auto lending. "
"14973410","14974770"," We are here in Puerto Rico."
"14974770","14980330"," There's a good opportunity for us to grow in the auto business and we have done so for the last"
"14980330","14980910"," two or three years."
"14981070","14984290"," But our main growth is coming from small mid-sized commercial loans. "
"14984730","14989350"," And they are expanding businesses, starting new businesses, rebuilding, refurbishing, et cetera,"
"14989430","14989590"," everything."
"14990450","14990930"," Correct."
"14991250","14995590"," As you know, Puerto Rico's economy is rebuilding from the hurricanes and the earthquakes. "
"14996250","15002150"," And that is definitely created a tremendous momentum in the economy and you're starting to see"
"15002150","15007030"," private capital coming to the island also to invest internally and from outside."
"15007450","15010730"," So, so all those are good data points for us."
"15010890","15013430"," We have record unemployment and the economy is growing. "
"15013690","15014750"," Manufacturing is doing well."
"15015250","15016350"," So it's about time."
"15016670","15020490"," And now it's nicer to be a banker than the last 17 years. "
"15020630","15021190"," I'll tell you a moment."
"15022070","15024770"," They're 20 years, 17 years of them were trouble."
"15025310","15029650"," But we're happy for you and your associates and the people of Puerto Rico. "
"15029970","15030730"," We appreciate it."
"15030910","15034630"," Jose Rafael Fernandez, the community banker of the year, by the way, American bankers."
"15035370","15035910"," Thank you. "
"15036070","15036350"," Award."
"15036590","15037390"," We appreciate your time."
"15038130","15038550"," Coming up. "
"15038910","15043570"," Netflix shares surging on a revenue beat, strong subs, better than expected first quarter guidance."
"15043850","15047890"," So, what could Netflix tell us about the rest of tech earnings ahead?"
"15048130","15051570"," We will explore that next exchange will be right back."
"15158900","15160560"," Yes, yes, yes. "
"15160780","15162900"," You see the queues had more room to run to the downside."
"15163620","15168820"," On the bottom screener and then also SPX has some more room to run to the downside as well."
"15169620","15172260"," I always like flushing the FOMO, don't you?"
"15172740","15174240"," My favorite things. "
"15175680","15177560"," Flushing the FOMO."
"15178440","15180380"," My favorite things to do."
"15180660","15182100"," Just flush that FOMO out. "
"15183220","15184040"," Feels good."
"15197760","15206460"," Oh, yeah, there it goes."
"15232130","15232730"," Good. "
"15241290","15247270"," Netflix shares are higher after the company added more than 13 million subscribers and beat revenue"
"15247270","15247630"," estimates."
"15248250","15251710"," At least 19 Wall Street firms are hiking price targets for the streamer."
"15251710","15255090"," So, what does their customer tell us about?"
"15255350","15257070"," Take a look at the spray and pray. "
"15257390","15258630"," Dubosa joins us now."
"15259130","15261130"," Spray and pray until it will affect."
"15261370","15264970"," So, obviously, the mega cap is very different businesses, very different. "

"15275810","15276850"," One organic growth."
"15277150","15279970"," A little bit more downside to go there on queues. "
"15280670","15283810"," Which has seen decelerating revenue over the last year."
"15284150","15289450"," So, it's an industry leader and it has high margin logical areas of growth."

"15315510","15318210"," When you look at other mega caps, it might have a more straightforward story. "
"15318690","15319990"," A meta comes to mind, right?"
"15320370","15322130"," It is an industry leader in social media."
"15322430","15324850"," It already has those OPEX targets behind it."
"15325270","15326390"," It's increasing in real time. "
"15326390","15327990"," I'll check on PayPal right now."
"15327990","15331450"," A more noisy or less straightforward story might be in Amazon, right?"
"15331550","15335150"," But there's still questions about its AI strategy and AWS growth."
"15335150","15338970"," So that's sort of what we could see in the next few weeks as we get the rest of the"

"15525140","15526420"," The everything app. "
"15527000","15528440"," Not necessarily Twitter, but."
"15528900","15531680"," They're probably trying to get out in front."
"15534240","15536760"," Of Tesla or not Tesla. "
"15537600","15538880"," X Twitter."
"15539740","15544400"," The my thesis here is that they probably know that."
"15545980","15547820"," Twitter is going to. "
"15548640","15555120"," It makes some form of announcement about banking and payments on X."
"15556500","15559380"," And so PayPal is trying to jump in front right now."
"15561940","15566820"," And I think I'm really fascinated if that is what it is."
"15568420","15570040"," Bork and I are not poor. "
"15570440","15573520"," Trader podcast and I were talking yesterday about AI."

"15591180","15591860"," Devious."
"15592800","15593560"," Some others. "
"15594120","15596960"," So there's like written language models that are."
"15598180","15602160"," Throttled for lack of a better word if it's called, but some of them are throttled."
"15602400","15607380"," But you can still turn them into being deviance or showing how. "
"15607800","15610200"," How crazy or how much they don't know."
"15611440","15617580"," But then there's some written language models that don't have restrictions on language or all kinds"
"15617580","15617960"," of other things."
"15617960","15623060"," There's a few of them, but not that many, but I'm fascinated by. "
"15623700","15627720"," Like whatever if this, if there is like an AI PayPal AI."
"15628540","15629560"," Take over."
"15630680","15632080"," How many trolls. "

"15648640","15650060"," I think that's what it was called. "
"15650560","15652720"," And I can remember being a young kid."
"15653800","15655500"," And you could take a paper clip."
"15656340","15662840"," And you would insert the paper clip into the unfold the paper clip and you would insert one end of"
"15662840","15665240"," the paper clip into the bottom of the receiver. "
"15666000","15669160"," On a handset on a public tape, a phone."
"15669600","15676720"," They stick the other end of the paper clip into a small hole at the base of the phone."
"15677660","15682820"," And that would trigger a dial tone that you could dial out of and make a free phone call. "
"15684240","15685600"," I am old, right?"
"15685860","15686420"," Knowing that stuff."
"15690360","15691300"," Evil Dan."
"15692260","15693220"," What up, biggie?"
"15693340","15693920"," How you doing, brother?"
"15695640","15698740"," If you guys think that's what's going to happen, let me know in the chat. "
"15698880","15700920"," If you're like, I think that's the same thing, cap."
"15701360","15706540"," Or do you guys think that Paypal is going to make an announcement like, oh, we're launching our own"
"15706540","15707540"," social media platform?"
"15708300","15709340"," Like, what is the announcements?"
"15709820","15711100"," What do you think the announcement is?"
"15712560","15716700"," For PayPal, they're going to try to compete with what Elon is planning."
"15716700","15723660"," A competitor, like actual banking, 24 hours a day with an AI representative. "
"15725220","15729640"," Do you think people are going to try to manipulate that AI model?"
"15730540","15733240"," Do you think they're successful?"
"15734100","15739020"," Do you think people will be able to commit fraud if they find weaknesses in that AI model?"
"15739480","15746440"," Do you think that someone out there that's bored would try to have phone sex with one of the"
"15746440","15749720"," bankers, right?"
"15749980","15753340"," Like, think about some of the atrocious stuff you could do."
"15757060","15760360"," Like, would you lose your, all kinds of questions?"
"15760900","15764300"," Like, can you get in trouble if you scream at the AI bot?"
"15765400","15768380"," Do you have to treat the AI bot nicely or not?"
"15768720","15769740"," They're not real, right?"
"15770120","15772940"," Can't you just, like, if you get upset, can you just scream at it?"
"15772940","15781120"," And then some other questions, too, would be how rigid will the answers be from an AI bot?"
"15782420","15784720"," Especially in gray areas, right?"
"15784900","15786340"," How many gray areas will come up?"
"15791330","15797770"," Kim K also teased a recent announcement, so maybe PayPal versus Kim K skims line."
"15804590","15808390"," When we lost the crossbar of the paperclip and the blue boxing was useless. "
"15808390","15809870"," Yep, yep, yep, yep."
"15814720","15820060"," Yeah, they would also, Art Fuzz say, and they would also post the Verters and PBXs where you can"
"15820060","15821580"," dial up from if you knew the code."
"15822200","15822740"," That's right. "
"15823000","15825760"," The BBS doesn't get free calls and teleconference from there."
"15825840","15826820"," This was in the 80s."
"15827400","15828860"," I was a little too young for that. "
"15829100","15831420"," When they were doing that, freaking, I was too young for that."
"15832120","15834900"," But I did at one time know the history of it."
"15835000","15836200"," There was one famous guy. "
"15836400","15837740"," He died recently, didn't he?"
"15838640","15840460"," The original guy that started that."
"15841900","15842800"," Come on, dude."
"15842920","15844520"," Get down to the early so we can buy a dip. "
"15848700","15850320"," I'm with Camilla on this one."
"15850840","15853180"," Get down to the early so we can buy a fucking dip."
"15853380","15855340"," Close the gap at 4 p.m. from yesterday. "
"15856760","15859460"," I would love to buy this dip down here."
"15859740","15861140"," They're not doing it right now."
"15864800","15868380"," If you're a bull, you're like, if you're a fucking bull here, you're like, fuck that. "
"15868660","15869760"," Sell all that shit down there."
"15869900","15871460"," Get down here so we can buy that shit."
"15872100","15875580"," Give me some room to breathe, baby, so you can make some money. "
"15881710","15883990"," Yeah, it was the Captain Crunch Whistle."
"15884270","15885170"," I remember that."
"15885490","15887630"," I remember it was the Captain Crunch Whistle. "
"15890270","15894850"," Art Fuzz saying it was the Pirates of Silicon Valley film, if you remember, if he remembers"
"15894850","15899690"," correctly, if you guys have never seen that film, there was like a, there was like one guy that"
"15899690","15905050"," figured out the Captain Crunch Whistle, I think, and then he had a posse or a gang of misfits."
"15906050","15911930"," And they were like the, really the original, like the original given or they were given credit as"
"15911930","15921810"," being some of the first black hat, packers of modernish tech, but not really black hat."
"15921910","15928290"," They weren't, they were just being mischievous more than anything, but I did do some of those"
"15928290","15928530"," tricks. "
"15928850","15929110"," I did."
"15929130","15935530"," And when I was in high school, we did figure out how to get free, free phone calls."
"15935850","15943850"," There were some other things you could do too, with candy machines, if I remember, I'm trying to"
"15943850","15950950"," remember what it was, how you would do with candy machines, fuck, I wonder what that was that you"
"15950950","15951270"," would do. "
"15951270","15954610"," I mean, I remember the, I remember the ones where you'd like shake the machine and stuff."
"15955670","15961970"," They would be like a backup or something, and then it would trigger a bunch of shit to come loose."
"15962330","15964010"," I don't remember if that was sodas or not though. "
"15968170","15971850"," Ernie's checking in right now saying Dixie has an inverted head and shoulder."
"15974010","15975330"," Thanks for checking in Ernie."
"15980570","15985030"," If you, so anyways, if you, if you, if you ever have a chance to watch that, if you're younger,"
"15985410","15991470"," and have never watched that, and have never watched that documentary, it's fascinating. "
"15991650","15992190"," It's really cool."
"15992710","15996470"," A bunch of kids, a bunch of, they don't think there were kids at that time."
"15996590","16001950"," I think they were like mid, late twenties, early thirties, then again, kids back then looked like"
"16001950","16008350"," they were 50 years old, but yeah, early seventies, man, is when that shit started, right?"
"16016150","16020270"," Yeah, I think Steve Jobs was in on that was, wasn't Steve, it wasn't Steve Jobs. "
"16020270","16024530"," And no, it wasn't Steve Jobs, it was the other guy, it was his partner."
"16025150","16031670"," It wasn't Steve Jobs, it was the other dude, what's his name, it was the original part of the guy"
"16031670","16035850"," that beats Vegas and I'm having a mind block on his name right now, I don't know why."
"16037510","16039510"," They were at the tip mates, I'm not going to look him up right now. "
"16039570","16047750"," The other founder of Apple was Wozniak, it was Steve Wozniak I think, I think Wozniak was hanging"
"16047750","16048210"," out with him."
"16048370","16049090"," I could be wrong in that."
"16049090","16056750"," This is all like, I think it was Wozniak, I'm not sure, but I think it was. "
"16058390","16062350"," I could be wrong, but I think it was Wozniak, he was doing that shit."
"16064470","16068830"," God, this is grind sideways here, just give me a fucking dip."
"16076940","16083000"," I think the one, the one guy that was, that was considered the guy, I think he died the last"
"16083000","16087840"," five years, maybe even more recently, this is all off the top of my head. "
"16092020","16098820"," Yeah, Bork McGork checking in right now, and he says that we're pretty even Steven, nobody picked"
"16098820","16102740"," flat, everybody's picking green or red, does that mean that it'll be a flat ER?"
"16106810","16114810"," Ram Husk saying that his friends and I used to sign up for kids bowl free during summers, included"
"16114810","16123230"," two games free, we had our own shoes, we were 22, and still going, they would ask for ID and"
"16123230","16127670"," we would say we were too young to have them, they finally had enough when we brought our six foot"
"16127670","16137190"," seven friend and who had a full beard, that's hilarious dude, did any of you guys as kids have some"
"16137190","16138030"," kind of beat?"
"16138630","16147170"," I guess, I guess my generation had ABBA on Nintendo to beat like Contra, was it Contra or Super"
"16147170","16151850"," Mario Brothers, for a bunch of them I think you could click ABBA and you get a bunch of free"
"16151850","16157610"," shit, like unlimited firing or something like that, so let me know what kind of hack that you have"
"16157610","16160830"," had when you were growing up or you could get away with something."
"16164350","16168390"," Yeah, Kamel dude, this is killing me man, just like fucking come on down dude, let's get this shit,"
"16168510","16175510"," let's get this party going, keep your eyes on Q's, Q's has a four to six point eight one as"
"16175510","16181570"," the 30 minute trigger, their half hour trigger though is at 425 15, so I might expect a little bit"
"16181570","16191420"," of extra blood down here and maybe even possibly trade 48471 on spy, that's what it"
"16191420","16198320"," was, Contra was up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA start, you're right, you're right."
"16199240","16201380"," Now that you said that, I remember that. "
"16204220","16210980"," Rocket Sergeant seven, I was 16, I looked can't read what he's saying, 21 and would not get"
"16210980","16212260"," targeted at the bar."
"16212920","16231700"," Oh yeah, baby, poke juice box reinforcing that same thing up, up, down, down, left, right,"
"16231720","16236140"," left, right, BA, relations, haha, oh, you shitting me?"
"16236440","16244320"," John Stewart going back to the daily show on Mondays, man, dude, you know what that sometimes I'll"
"16244320","16252040"," say that I wish or say that sometimes I'll say that I wish the Republicans or I think I don't"
"16252040","16254780"," think Donald Trump wins this election, I'll be honest with you."
"16255220","16263460"," From a from my person, I'm trying not to get Paul political here, but But from my perspective and"
"16263460","16270680"," objective perspective, I don't, I think the setup is on for Trump to get the nomination. "
"16270780","16272600"," I think he loses to Biden."
"16274060","16281780"," But I always say things like if the Republicans had like a rock or who was the other guy I"
"16281780","16285500"," was rooting, not quite rooting for, but there was another guy that I said would be a great"
"16285500","16291560"," Republican to run for the Republicans like if you want the populace, but you want them to not be so"
"16291560","16295920"," divisive, there's another guy that I was thinking of that could run for the Republicans."
"16296260","16297740"," But that's a guy for the Democrats. "
"16299360","16305160"," If you ran like a John Stewart as a Democratic nominee, he would win."
"16305620","16309840"," He could run as an outside candidate and beat Biden right now, I would think."
"16310620","16312240"," He probably doesn't want that. "
"16312460","16313060"," I wouldn't want it."
"16313060","16315080"," I can, I don't blame him for not wanting it either."
"16315080","16316580"," Who the fuck would want to be president?"
"16317540","16320980"," Talk about ending your life as you know it, probably your kid's lives. "
"16322240","16325400"," Do I think Biden can last four more years?"
"16325920","16328040"," No, I do not."
"16328920","16335920"," And if he does last four more years, it'll likely turn into a similar situation as Ronald Reagan."
"16337040","16346780"," Ronald Reagan's last I believe two years in office, he was at that time they called it senile and"
"16346780","16351180"," he was the office of the presidency was basically run by his cabinet. "
"16351820","16358220"," I'm assuming here that that they would love, I would assume here that the Democrats or Republicans,"
"16358220","16367860"," the DNC and RNC would love nothing more than to have a president that's slightly incapacitated."
"16368300","16370340"," Remember, this is a power struggle."
"16370680","16376260"," So like Diane, Diane Feinstein, there's a list of them on both sides of the aisle. "
"16377280","16386020"," The DNC and RNC love older candidates, especially if they're not as active as they once were, so"
"16386020","16394460"," that they can push through their own, their own, what does it call it again?"
"16394640","16398860"," I figured I'm having a really, I'm really tired, I've been breaking my balls here working like 12 R"
"16398860","16399180"," days."
"16403340","16409779"," Lincoln is running things anyway to think, yeah, my only real, so I'm just so you guys know I'm a"
"16409779","16410140"," Democrat."
"16414240","16420640"," Now, I'll be, I'm as a Democrat, I'll tell you a few things, Biden is not my president. "
"16421880","16424060"," I don't like Biden as my president."
"16424320","16429599"," I find him to be Trump light, I know that it be Republicans probably don't want to hear that."
"16430619","16436360"," He's very much in line with a lot of what Trump did to not all of his decisions, but a"
"16436360","16438939"," lot, a lot of Trump like going on with Biden. "
"16438939","16442220"," I don't like the Democratic control of the primaries."
"16444119","16448300"," And I really do not, I'm not a fan of Kamala Harris, I'm sorry."
"16448540","16450560"," She came in last place in the Democratic primary. "
"16451460","16454340"," I don't want to see her assume the presidency."
"16456430","16459300"," I would prefer Biden to pick a new running mate."
"16459520","16464660"," That's a rare current six day low at one spot three five one six per US dollar. "
"16464660","16469000"," I'm disappointed that they're not going to do that right now."
"16469099","16474779"," That bothers me a lot, but also I'm not going to vote for Trump."
"16475720","16477360"," So I don't know what to do. "
"16477419","16486599"," I think I might end up throwing my vote away this this election, but I think there's a setup in"
"16486599","16488439"," place for Trump to lose."
"16488439","16489660"," There's, you know, it's weird."
"16489860","16497619"," There's this like, it's like that the whole Trump light thing and you're like, what's the other"
"16497619","16498720"," alternative thing?"
"16502580","16505700"," Yeah, I'm not a, yeah, I'm not a fan of either of them. "
"16505820","16511419"," I'm not a fan of Vivek, I'm not a fan of Kamala Harris either, neither of them, I know I'm"
"16511419","16511840"," complaining."
"16513380","16518520"," I'm like whining about working hard, I'm dragging, I need more coffee, I'm dragging ass right now."
"16523099","16524320"," Vote for myself. "
"16524840","16526180"," I'm going to ask you that question."
"16527759","16533840"," Would you vote if you were a Republican, would he swing any, if any guys, the Republicans out there"
"16533840","16542580"," is, is John Stewart populist enough to capture some of your votes or maybe a little bit too liberal"
"16542580","16546279"," for you, he'd get my, I'm a veteran, so he'd get my vote."
"16547540","16550220"," He's, he's for veterans rights, he'd get my vote all day long. "
"16551980","16552939"," Trump all the way."
"16553380","16558860"," Is there a populist that you would vote for for, and that's the other thing, I don't like Trump for"
"16558860","16562080"," his age either, like I can't do the age thing on Trump."
"16563080","16564340"," He's old as fuck too. "
"16564419","16568340"," I can't believe you guys all want to vote in all these old guys, like, I think you're out of"
"16568340","16572240"," your fucking minds want just the age question, just that alone."
"16572240","16573939"," I'm like, uh, no, thanks."
"16574140","16578860"," I don't want to see fucking Biden out there at 80 fucking six Trump out there at 84. "
"16581119","16582860"," Yeah, I think the rock would work."
"16583500","16584520"," There's somebody else."
"16584720","16585840"," There's one or two, I think. "
"16586720","16587840"," There's two other guys."
"16588119","16593360"," I got to try to remember the two that I have in mind, populists, uh, that could be great"
"16593360","16598580"," Republican, uh, president or like not great meaning like I think the rock could be a great"
"16598580","16599020"," president."
"16599020","16601820"," I'm talking about like a vote winning votes. "
"16603099","16608720"," So not necessarily, hey, but the rock would make a great president, but like you can capture the"
"16608720","16611700"," votes that your need to win."
"16618360","16622380"," Terry Cruz, Dave, what else we got out there?"
"16622860","16623560"," I've tried to do that."
"16623640","16628960"," I've got I had a had a ringer yesterday of the day before, and I was thinking about this guy"
"16628960","16632640"," and I'm like, man, this this person could fucking win easy landslide. "
"16640840","16642160"," What about females?"
"16642800","16643480"," How about some women?"
"16643640","16649680"," You guys have any how about women and African Americans, uh, some of some other race, maybe or"
"16649680","16663300"," someone from a from a background, maybe that, uh, came from nothing comes down"
"16663300","16667259"," to policies of a fiscal conservative social liberal following the constitution of bounced budgets"
"16667259","16667860"," important to me."
"16668400","16676119"," Um, you know, the thing for me is, uh, you know what scares me to death is, um, we're not"
"16676119","16686070"," to death, but, um, what, what, or I said, I said scares"
"16686070","16692990"," me to death, but in an in elections, in presidential elections, there's always, uh, an issue that"
"16692990","16694330"," people vote on."
"16695270","16699710"," Uh, and I wonder what that, but how about maybe very frame, maybe I can rephrase that. "
"16699710","16704730"," So if you were a Democrat or try not to fight with each other, by the way, we're all adults"
"16704730","16705050"," here."
"16705189","16705349"," Okay."
"16705810","16708270"," It's trying to be nice to each other work, work community. "
"16708950","16711990"," I realize that we all have different viewpoints."
"16713070","16718369"," Uh, I realize that you think others are worse than yours, but we have to have open communication."
"16719470","16726630"," I'm telling you, you have to have open communication so, um, so that we can be a civil society. "
"16726630","16734590"," Uh, you can't win people over if you don't, uh, argue with them, okay, in a constructive way."
"16734830","16738490"," I realize if emotions get out of control, we'll end the conversation."
"16739390","16742669"," I have some questions for you though, so please don't get mad at anybody. "
"16742730","16743250"," Okay."
"16743970","16745810"," Uh, but I'm interested in this."
"16746050","16747009"," I think you should be too. "
"16747430","16757169"," If you had a single issue that would make you slam the, uh, the election lever for, uh, candidate,"
"16757509","16758730"," what would it be in this election?"
"16759990","16768369"," Uh, I'm, I'm asking that question because, uh, when, uh, when Ronald Reagan won, there was an"
"16768369","16770250"," expectation that he would not win."
"16772230","16776770"," And, uh, remember the whole, remember the whole, it's the taxes dummy, right?"
"16777550","16783230"," So you'll, they people are like, people are like, Oh, honey, I would never, ever vote like that."
"16784490","16784970"," Right. "
"16784970","16788890"," And then they get in the booth and they're like, I'm the one that's paying fucking all those"
"16788890","16790510"," goddamn taxes."
"16790910","16793330"," And this guy told me he'd cut taxes."
"16793950","16795890"," Of course we know neither of them do, right?"
"16796090","16798370"," Democrat Democrats and Republicans are both bores. "
"16799230","16806810"," If you don't know that, there's no such thing as a fiscal conservative in either party."
"16808170","16813270"," That's on the Senate, the Republicans, or the Senate, the House of Representatives, nor the"
"16813270","16822650"," presidency, um, but as a single issue, would you vote thinking, um, you'd be getting some kind of"
"16822650","16824870"," better, uh, uh, what that?"
"16825050","16826050"," What is that issue for you?"
"16826150","16831700"," If you want me to ask him campaign finance reform would do it for you."
"16833480","16838420"," Uh, what else you got there, cost of goods in the border?"
"16839020","16840660"," You know, like, I, that's a good one. "
"16840660","16844280"," So, you know what's fascinating about the border is like the hippies."
"16846720","16848960"," The border is a tough one, man."
"16849260","16850280"," It's so fucked up. "
"16850460","16855420"," It's like, um, it's so fucked up and like, uh, like some of Democrats, right?"
"16855520","16857080"," I'm like, we have to have control immigration."
"16857620","16863520"," We have to, um, but our immigration policies are fucking dog shit too."
"16863920","16865780"," Like they're utter dog shit. "
"16865780","16871800"," So it's, I, I love how they put us in this situation where like, or I'm in that situation where"
"16871800","16877780"," I'm like, I'm like, hey, I agree, uh, we need, we need, uh, more controls on who's entering and"
"16877780","16881660"," leaving, um, or at least knowing who's entering and leaving."
"16881960","16884380"," Not so much more controls, but like, hey, who are you?"
"16884540","16890760"," What are you doing back in the day and like the early 1900s, uh, we would have way more migrant"
"16890760","16896740"," workers, uh, from Mexico, come into the U.S. and they would, uh, farm and then go back home, uh,"
"16896900","16901360"," quite freely, like right now we've got people just coming and going, right?"
"16901540","16902820"," Especially across the southern border."
"16903600","16906240"," We have some of them across the northern border as well, believe it or not. "
"16906760","16908700"," Uh, but we want to know who these people are at least, right?"
"16908800","16909400"," Like, who are you?"
"16909540","16909980"," What are you doing?"
"16910620","16911700"," Uh, how long are you staying?"
"16912380","16918320"," Right now, of course, uh, though, to get into the United States is one of the most difficult"
"16918320","16919920"," countries to visit."
"16921040","16926220"," One of the most difficult, I don't know how much do you guys travel, um, but if any of you"
"16926220","16931900"," have traveled on tourist visas, any kind of visa, uh, there are countries out there that are brutal"
"16931900","16939500"," to get into or very expensive, um, like challenging to get into and challenging to afford and"
"16939500","16941820"," we're, we are one of the biggest of those countries."
"16942460","16948980"," Japan, lots of a lot of a lot of the EU, England, uh, is very difficult to get into. "
"16949300","16954560"," Australia, very difficult to get into in the US as well, believe it or not."
"16954940","16959340"," So I feel like it's a two-sided sword that we're fighting about, but we all kind of agree upon."
"16960860","16961960"," Uh, what else?"
"16962940","16964520"," What's in, what else you guys got there?"
"16964820","16967520"," Uh, lower taxes, trying to read through some of this. "
"16969560","16977460"," Uh, uh, uh, uh, Darian Gap, uh, Board of the French Committee of Darian Gap is alarming."
"16977980","16979920"," Can I take care of a family education health care?"
"16980600","16983880"," Uh, and I'm for increasing legal immigration, but this open border is BS."
"16983880","16984960"," Yeah, I agree with that too. "
"16985720","16988060"," Um, we need to go back to the Ellis Island system."
"16988180","16992760"," I like that a lot, like some kind of a modern, uh, system of that."
"16992900","16995020"," I kind of like that to term limits. "
"16995020","16996440"," I like, I like the term limits."
"16996440","17003200"," The age limits, uh, and I also like the, uh, they can't make money from their position during or"
"17003200","17008920"," after and neither can their family members be enriched by like, stock trade and all that kind of"
"17008920","17009140"," stuff."
"17009300","17013180"," I think that's a, that's a, that's a bipartisan thing, right?"
"17013280","17014360"," I think everybody here would agree with that. "
"17015700","17017440"," Uh, it's not tough."
"17017720","17018260"," Shut it down."
"17018440","17019100"," Look at the Swiss. "
"17019860","17021140"," Um, that's another thing."
"17021520","17022160"," I don't think it is."
"17022340","17023880"," I don't think it's difficult to shut it down. "
"17024380","17027900"," Uh, but on the flip side of that coin, we need immigrants."
"17028700","17033780"," Uh, we need, we need immigrants with education, uh, that can bring other education in this country."
"17034020","17040220"," And we also need immigrants to do the shit that you as an American don't ever want to do. "
"17040760","17047540"," I'm looking at you people out there that don't want to be, uh, skinning and de-gutting chickens in"
"17047540","17049260"," a hot plant down in Alabama."
"17049260","17054400"," Uh, lower taxes for the middle class."
"17054880","17055180"," Uh huh. "
"17055920","17060560"," I'd like to see, um, the, the destruction of, uh, of inflation."
"17061440","17064580"," We know that the inflation numbers are a fucking scam, right?"
"17064980","17067460"," And how they're built, we want real inflation to come down."
"17067660","17070020"," Some kind of a reset would be nice. "
"17071980","17073840"," Now it is much peace as possible."
"17074340","17075280"," I'm on that one too."
"17075700","17077720"," So on the, uh, peace is possible. "
"17078180","17083860"," I am deathly afraid right now of, uh, China and Russia."
"17084240","17087420"," They're not our friends, neither of those two countries."
"17088140","17095280"," And I am, I am really afraid right now of an escalation of war, conventional war right now. "
"17095660","17100620"," Sweden, Norway, uh, those countries are panicky right now."
"17101180","17104120"," I'm assuming that's from some kind of insider intelligence."
"17106020","17110860"," When your generals come out in public and say, get ready for the next one to three years, they"
"17110860","17112900"," mean, get ready in the next month. "
"17117190","17119430"," No solid plan to naturalize them."
"17119530","17122990"," How does America get them to become tax paying citizens?"
"17123930","17126710"," So let's start with, that's a big one right now."
"17126850","17129050"," So I want you guys to know that I'm from out west. "
"17130030","17135470"," Um, most illegal immigrants in the United States pay taxes."
"17135470","17142170"," Uh, they pay taxes via, if they're renting that's built into their rent, they pay sales tax."
"17142910","17147730"," And most of these guys, they have a thing called the US today called the real ID. "
"17149070","17158850"," Most illegals in the past 15 years are running on a, uh, someone else's real social security"
"17158850","17159430"," number."
"17159430","17163230"," So they actually pay taxes, uh, into the system."
"17163230","17168910"," They usually do it on two or three different illegals, uh, and they do actually pay taxes. "
"17169350","17171930"," Now they don't actually get the refund on them though."
"17175110","17180310"," And this is the other side of it, uh, the naturalization process."
"17180350","17186010"," I'm not necessarily keen on naturalizing some of these illegals. "
"17186570","17189030"," I'd just like to document them, right?"
"17189330","17191470"," Have them pay taxes, all that kind of stuff."
"17191650","17192870"," I'd really like to just pay."
"17192870","17197250"," We know who you are and, uh, let's make sure that you're making money. "
"17197790","17200470"," Um, let's give you some kind of like, you have to pay."
"17200670","17204890"," Like if you're going to, if you're going to come here illegally now, let's say to be a seasonal"
"17204890","17207250"," worker in, uh, apple farms."
"17207550","17211510"," We have a lot of illegals, some of you might not know this on the east coast. "
"17212170","17217990"," We have a lot of illegals that, uh, work in, uh, migrant farmers on like apple farms and stuff."
"17218170","17221570"," They work in chicken, uh, slaughterhouses and stuff like that in the south."
"17222870","17224790"," Uh, I just want to know who they are, right?"
"17224990","17230590"," Set up a system that they can pay into for basic health care needs, uh, have them pay taxes and"
"17230590","17234510"," give them a, give them way to make money, send it back to their families and then exit the country,"
"17234510","17236130"," uh, when the season ends. "
"17236350","17238530"," Any of you guys out west know this happens too, right?"
"17239450","17246130"," Uh, you got like, that's where we need these workers, uh, ski resorts have illegals that are, that"
"17246130","17248050"," come up and work in these ski resorts."
"17248390","17252530"," They bring a bus every spring and drive them back to the border."
"17253390","17261110"," And that's in every facet of your life, every facet of your life likely within one or two, uh,"
"17261450","17266910"," degrees of separation has an illegal, uh, behind whatever you're consuming. "
"17274370","17277850"," Term limits, campaign, finance reform are both needed."
"17278110","17283190"," That's not, I've read that across the, uh, reading that across both YouTube and Twitch right now."
"17285190","17286350"," I like that. "
"17286490","17287930"," We need a wall, but it should have doors."
"17288350","17288990"," I like that idea."
"17292470","17294190"," More young people in Congress. "
"17294450","17295130"," I'm with that too."
"17295270","17296750"," I like more young people in Congress."
"17297370","17301570"," Uh, someone here saying your health care system is a joke and you're all in debt. "
"17301890","17303950"," So many better work conditions are a living wage."
"17304970","17305450"," Yeah."
"17306810","17315150"," Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. "
"17316770","17324110"," Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,"
"17324110","17325710"," oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
"17325730","17327910"," Wouldn't it be so nice to get that little bat right there?"
"17329330","17332150"," Just like that rain that down a little bit right there?"
"17333970","17335270"," I don't think we get it though."
"17335950","17340330"," If you're in puts right here, even if we blast through this down to that 4 PM closing price and"
"17340330","17350640"," that pivot, it, not a bad place to take your puts off, health care is tough, greed"
"17350640","17351700"," and power, right?"
"17352580","17359320"," I wish we could be the shining example for the first world countries and nations and do it the"
"17359320","17366300"," right, like take everything, all the best parts of how Japan, how Scandinavian countries run it and"
"17366300","17368820"," try to have like the best of that. "
"17368820","17370700"," We don't though, which sucks."
"17374360","17375480"," What up, Kim?"
"17383210","17385750"," Yeah, the no stock trading is a big one, right?"
"17386010","17390950"," The no stock trading man, the enrichment of these guys is brutal."
"17391350","17393270"," Oh, that's who it was, Mr. Talking Monkey. "
"17394610","17395910"," That's who it was, dude."
"17396250","17396590"," My dude."
"17396590","17406030"," So, Mr. Talking Monkey, I think that if Jamie Dimon announced he was running for president"
"17406030","17410010"," tomorrow, he would win the Republican nomination. "
"17411230","17413290"," I am 100% with you on that, brother."
"17413950","17415590"," That's who I was thinking of the other day."
"17416110","17419570"," Jamie Dimie, Dimon, Jaime Dimon. "
"17420590","17425330"," I think he would win the Republican nomination, hands down, hands down, dude."
"17426130","17430270"," Hands down, he would be over, over, over, over."
"17431030","17435670"," Whether you agree with him or not, I think he would get that nomination in a minute. "
"17437950","17442390"," You'd like to get rid of the income tax and go to a system where taxes are paid on things"
"17442390","17443370"," purchase."
"17443910","17446090"," Ooh, I would love that."
"17446290","17449130"," I'm pretty wealthy, so I would love that. "
"17449970","17451830"," I would love that."
"17451970","17454910"," I would get so rich if we did that."
"17456250","17458250"," I would love that system. "
"17461170","17462550"," I would love it."
"17462930","17464630"," The pours would pay for me."
"17472950","17477830"," Most European programs have success because in part they have a high population density throughout"
"17477830","17479010"," most of its geography. "
"17480890","17482350"," There you go, Camille, baby."
"17484630","17487790"," Yeah, those taxes are so good for people with money."
"17489250","17490250"," So good. "
"17495510","17497050"," Here we go right here."
"17497850","17509130"," I think if I had a preference on taxes, I"
"17509130","17515770"," would like to see us go back to the tax structure we had the mid-1950s."
"17515890","17516630"," That's what I would prefer. "
"17516830","17522070"," The mid-1950s, 1960s, I would like that system that we had in place."
"17532620","17535860"," Oh, hell no, hell no, hell no."
"17536700","17546420"," I have money to save and then I would lease, I would absolutely lease, 100%, 100 "
"17546420","17548660","% and it's easy for me to lease. "
"17549420","17553160"," It is very difficult for poor people to lease."
"17555930","17560890"," Do you probably don't know that, as a matter of fact I was just talking to Joe about this on"
"17560890","17569750"," the phone, capital expenditures for me this year, I failed into the end of the year."
"17570190","17570790"," I failed. "
"17573470","17580450"," In the end of this year I should have stopped making money and I should have bought a bunch of"
"17580450","17580750"," shit."
"17581530","17586130"," So I could have claimed it on my taxes this year, a bunch of capital expenditures, I should have"
"17586130","17592310"," spent more money at the end of this year at 2023 and I also should have stopped making money in"
"17592310","17594730"," like September of this past year."
"17601820","17606040"," The first free healthcare service in the world is developed in the Scottish Highlands not known for"
"17606040","17607460"," having a high population density. "
"17608480","17614140"," You know we have basic, we have of course we get the VA right, that's kind of a national"
"17614140","17614700"," healthcare."
"17615380","17616900"," We don't mind giving that to veterans."
"17617520","17625200"," We have some form of healthcare for all in the form of Medicare and Medicaid and emergency room"
"17625200","17625460"," visits. "
"17625460","17627220"," Of course we have debt attached to that."
"17628580","17630660"," That's the shit that pisses me off man."
"17630920","17637780"," It's like a function of our capitalism to white people out of this country in medical debt. "
"17638840","17644900"," It's like a part of the trigger to wash people out of our system."
"17645260","17650740"," So if like if you didn't make bad decisions, if you did good with your with your whole life, right,"
"17650840","17656760"," you made money, you paid your debts down, raised a family, bought a house, all that kind of stuff."
"17657120","17663000"," The last trigger with the hope in that last trigger right now is that you have some kind of"
"17663000","17670040"," devastating healthcare issues that you have to liquidate to all of your good job that you did your"
"17670040","17672040"," entire life to pay that off. "
"17673600","17681660"," We'd have to have some kind of a death tax right to trigger that if it wasn't for healthcare doing"
"17681660","17681880"," it."
"17682500","17688900"," Probably some kind of a death tax that would remove their wealth to recycle it into younger"
"17688900","17689540"," generations."
"17689540","17695540"," You have to think about that depth how you trigger that right if you were to make a national health"
"17695540","17700380"," care, you'd probably need a trigger to wash people out of the system at some point. "
"17700860","17706620"," Like you let them pass on wealth, but not like there would be an amplification of passing along"

"17734410","17744030"," So here's my question to you, this morning, this morning, right, there are a lot"
"17744030","17753800"," of people that were bullish right here, a lot"
"17753800","17754860"," of people bullish right here."
"17757060","17759980"," Are you bullish right now down here?"
"17763120","17763700"," Let me know."
"17766880","17767800"," Are you bullish?"
"17768060","17776550"," If you were bullish this morning, are you bullish here?"
"17785890","17788350"," Or are you bullish here?"
"17788970","17790550"," Are you bullish here?"
"17801840","17808480"," Limit buyer says, I'm only bullish on tops, I'm"
"17808480","17815680"," only bullish at the top. "
"17824260","17833670"," You know, so like Rocket Surgeon just said, I'm trying to be careful when I speak because I'm lucky"
"17833670","17835050"," to have health insurance with my job."
"17835050","17837050"," Many don't, but there are no easy answers."
"17837490","17842230"," Dude, I see people with health insurance getting flushed even with insurance. "
"17844030","17846070"," They think it's as better than it actually is."
"17847410","17849190"," Oh yeah, there we go, there we go."
"17850530","17858050"," So here's the pivot point down below, here's S1 and S2 and S3 down here. "
"17859110","17861890"," We go coast to coast down here, right down there."
"17865390","17867210"," Here's your hourly trigger."
"17868050","17872810"," If you're a bull, this is your first dip buy right here. "
"17873070","17875910"," This is your first dip buy."
"17876990","17881130"," Now saying that, let's take a look at something here."
"17881230","17884230"," It's got a little look, let's have a little look see here. "
"17885350","17889930"," On its face value, this should be your first dip buy, but I want to show you guys something here."
"17889930","17896370"," So we're going to go to the trigger screen, nine makes natural gas, February, futures, settle at"
"17896370","17896690"," $2."
"17897090","17898670"," So we're going to go to a 30 minute chart. "
"17904750","17924460"," And we're going to take a look at the, so the, so the daily trigger here, it's pulling"
"17924460","17929100"," off the, the hourly can come down a little bit more, a little bit more of the hourly come down."
"17931860","17936520"," That plus 26 right now, it could be some more weakness here."
"17943430","17945870"," Let's just check this in a half hour basis. "
"17946150","17951390"," We're due for a bounce though, you see these three, these three red bars, one, two and three."
"17952110","17953610"," I'm going to expect a bounce here."
"17953690","17954990"," It's now 232 in the afternoon. "
"17954990","17958790"," I'm going to expect a bounce here for this half an hour."
"17958790","17959130"," Okay."
"17959670","17969030"," If you're a bear, you want to stay below 487 37, 487 37, we're going to go to a one"

"17980260","17982040"," I'm going to expect a bounce here."
"17984540","17996780"," Bears want to hold this, here's what I hold this right here, okay, to"
"17996780","17997680"," get down here."
"18000100","18007080"," So bears need to hold this right here, they need to hold, they need to hold this right here, right"
"18007080","18016960"," there, and I'd probably go like that right"
"18016960","18017260"," there. "
"18017260","18020940"," So you get the new low right there, right down there, something like that."
"18025850","18026810"," Something like that."
"18027510","18029630"," And I would really like to see the piercing of this. "
"18029830","18037830"," I'd really like to see like pierce this, squeeze up here, do a quick check back, and then to the"
"18037830","18038790"," downside right there."
"18039590","18041630"," And matter of fact, I want to change this one too."
"18042690","18047870"," I want to see the trade off of the half hour trigger, something like that. "
"18049610","18055710"," I'd like to see this, and I would like to buy a dip down here, right down there, just like"
"18055710","18055950"," that."
"18059270","18067030"," We have a little bit more room to run on SPX to the downside, and we've got SPX to the"
"18067030","18069370"," downside here has some ability to go down some more."
"18070230","18074150"," So you can take a look at this, I want you to see this as SPX gamma. "
"18076190","18084030"," We still have not tagged, we still haven't tagged the 30 minute trigger, still have not tagged the"
"18084030","18090670"," hourly trigger, have not tagged 4860 down here, I lost it, I already lost it."
"18092850","18102330"," And our real support below is down here on the hourly trigger, so I'm going to move this green box"
"18102330","18107370"," down here, and I'd like to see more downside here."
"18108570","18118430"," That's at 4850, I'd like to see 4850 get tagged on SPX, check"
"18122750","18130950"," Tesla, Tesla's still bouncing here, Tesla expectation that trades its sideways, and I'm going to"
"18130950","18137210"," expect on cues something like similar, okay, something like this, and then just bouncing around"
"18137210","18145870"," here, waiting for Tesla to report, and we could see some blood if Tesla has a bad report,"
"18146350","18161040"," that works,"
"18161320","18164100"," something like that maybe, make that prettier. "
"18175790","18178470"," What am I thinking for Friday calls?"
"18179030","18188930"," I want you guys to know that I have closed meta, I am inputs for sideways"
"18188930","18194650"," and down action in the spoos, and I'm long Tesla right now, all"
"18203890","18213650"," right, I'm going to take a quick break, it's just, if you notice in the middle of the"
"18213650","18222270"," screen, there is a poll being run right now, it's I vote space bar, red, green or flat"
"18222270","18225990"," for Tesla's open tomorrow."
"18231470","18241370"," If you see price break above, right here, and hold a reversal to the upside, be careful,"
"18242050","18247850"," I'd be looking for trade up in here, not down here, but up in there."

"18645510","20138460"," right, got"
"20138460","20146240"," a little bit of, a little bit of coffee in the middle of the day, don't normally do that,"
"20146600","20153120"," and we're going to set this one up a little bit different than yesterday,"
"20153120","20164820"," we see here, let's turn, close"
"20164820","20174740"," that one, close that one off right there, and we're pretty much even Steven"
"20174740","20183800"," on the voting for, we've got nobody thinking flat, I'm actually surprised at that, that would not"
"20183800","20193740"," shock me, if we were flat, on the open tomorrow, so I'm fascinated that nobody had"
"20193740","20200220"," voted for that, so we've got pretty much 50-50 right now in the poll, so we're going to meet"
"20200220","20208660"," that right now, and I'm going to bring something up here in just a moment, let me see if I"
"20208660","20220950"," can, let me see what I got going on here, think"
"20220950","20231650"," type one, quick second here, I'm going to turn this up, turn this up, I"
"20231650","20241790"," have any of you who have been to Santa Fe, Santa Fe, New Mexico, have"
"20241790","20251790"," any familiarity with Santa Fe, New Mexico, there was a small town outside"
"20251790","20260310"," of Santa Fe, like an artist colony, I'm not talking about the earthship place, but there is a small"
"20260310","20270310"," town with a trains, old trains, with a bar, like"
"20270310","20276890"," a honky-tonk bar, and I think the people even lived in some of the trains, one street, main street"
"20276890","20283610"," town, do any of you remember or recall a town like that just outside of Santa Fe, let me know,"
"20284050","20289970"," okay, so we've got a little bit of a role here, double top right here on a one-button basis,"
"20290990","20297170"," we are sitting on the hourly trigger right now, we have a report after the close day of Tesla"
"20297170","20306910"," coming up, highly anticipated ER, and a lot of, a lot of expectations here,"
"20306910","20308990"," I'm going to assume, I used to belong"
"20308990","20318870"," to some of you, and let's go to the trigger screen,"
"20319030","20325270"," now let's go to the weebled, let's go to the trigger screen here, we're going to put a Tesla in,"
"20325630","20334670"," I mean, an important one right here, a Tesla, and I'm going to do something I think is cool, I'm"
"20334670","20339730"," not sure if it's cool, but I think it's cool, and this is kind of how I like to look"
"20339730","20348790"," at, kind of how I like to look at ER reports, some of you are familiar with this in previous"
"20348790","20356530"," ERs, or ER seasons, look at the, this is the one-minute chart, Tesla just kind of trading sideways"
"20356530","20364850"," at this point, hourly trigger flattening out on the, on the chart, you see the hourly, not as"
"20364850","20374630"," vertical as it once was, big vertical placement down here, and then it was kind of parked, and I"
"20374630","20380390"," think I have something cool to do right here, so hold on give me one quick second here, options,"
"20381550","20391070"," dot AI earnings calendar, and we've got some weekly"
"20391070","20400170"," earnings reports, I might have that wrong, I don't know"
"20400170","20413590"," if they're cool,"
"20413590","20421190"," all right, we can do that, all right, so I'm going to bring something over to, oh, maybe, I don't"
"20421190","20425870"," know how to do this, so we're going to do it, we're going to do a quick little chat here,"
"20425970","20434630"," okay, obviously can I do my screen right here, cap screen, so this is the earnings equity calendar,"
"20435590","20445310"," the expected move is 6.3%, I'm going to pop a little, pop"
"20445310","20453090"," a little 6.3% here, you can't see this part of what I'm doing, but we're going to come"
"20453090","20455790"," back to it in just a moment, I'll go back to that screen. "
"20456490","20461350"," So according to four sources, the US and Iraq are close to initiating talks on the future of US"
"20461350","20466250"," military presence in Iraq, the process could take months or two years, US troops were all not"
"20466250","20471670"," imminent, US ambassador to Iraq today, and the Iraqi foreign minister a letter related to the"
"20471670","20477630"," process of ending in the US-led coalition establishing bilateral relations, so again, four sources"
"20477630","20482850"," here are being cited otherwise, say in the US and Iraq are close to initiating talks on the future"
"20482850","20484770"," of US military presence in Iraq."
"20491570","20499430"," So 6.3%, you see that right, this is the expected move, 6.3 up or down, then what we're"
"20499430","20509230"," going to do is we're going to scroll through some more data in here, for Tesla ER history, and this"
"20509230","20513550"," is really what I want to show you here, this is the important one, okay, this is the first one"
"20513550","20520130"," that I like to see, it doesn't always work out like this, but sometimes you can find insight from"
"20520130","20527970"," prior reports, you can see that Tesla continued on its downward slope, it was already, it was"
"20527970","20532790"," already trading down, continued down, right, this one right here though did not, right, we had a"
"20532790","20540250"," swift reversal to the downside in July 19th, we had a continuation though down here in August 19th"
"20540250","20548950"," of 2022, we're going to go over to, whoop, let's go back here, did I have that one right there,"
"20549070","20558170"," yeah, April, continuation down in April, excuse me, they've got a January 25th continuation in"
"20558170","20568030"," direction, August 19th, continuation for a day, then a reversal on good news, but then more"
"20568030","20576570"," continuation down, so even good news was brushed off, like fluffed off good news, July 20th of"
"20576570","20585090"," 2022, continuation of the upside, April 20th of 2022, continuation of the downside, January 26th"
"20585090","20591810"," 2022, continuation to the downside, actually bloodbath, then continuation to the downside, so"
"20591810","20597830"," that's kind of concerning here, we don't have too many examples of full reversals in Tesla in"
"20597830","20604430"," trend, there's even if we have a reversal to the upside, we're still see continuation to the"
"20604430","20613670"," downside, except for one example, that looks like April of, excuse me, April of"
"20613670","20622490"," 2023, where we saw a full reversal on Tesla, so we're gonna go back to this chart right here, this"
"20622490","20629990"," is the 6.3% expected move, right here, so we're gonna draw this in, it's a 3.16 in"
"20629990","20637510"," the afternoon, we're gonna do a little target right here, just like this, that's the expected move,"
"20637770","20647630"," okay, 6.3%, downside move, where price is right now, 6.6%, about 6 "
"20647630","20656720",".3, right there, we're gonna snap this line right here, just like that,"
"20657440","20665560"," we're gonna make that green, which of course it's not gonna be bullish if it is green, put that one"
"20665560","20675500"," in right there, green, get rid of this, we know what the range is, the expected"
"20675500","20684820"," range is here, just as a note on this expected range, that the channels right, zigzag channels are"
"20684820","20693580"," slightly lower today, so we could even go a little bit lower, downside target 190, the dealers are"
"20693580","20703020"," pricing in 195, into the end of this bell right here, this way I move this on a, switch this"
"20703020","20710520"," to a one minute chart, and now let's take a look at it on, see we can find right here,"
"20710900","20720400"," right in here, try to expand this a little bit, we're gonna make this one yellow"
"20720400","20730960"," right there, and we're gonna do an upside target of 230, to"
"20730960","20742680"," be the red box right here, unless"
"20742680","20756390"," something absurd, if you are a bull, and you see price squeeze above this daily trigger, if"
"20756390","20761750"," you see price squeeze above and it holds, that's extremely bullish for tomorrow, believe it or not,"
"20761750","20768130"," so if you're a bull you want to see, you don't want to see like yeah we're going up here,"
"20768750","20774630"," and then we come back down, you want to see a break above 233.84, and a hold above that"
"20774630","20780490"," number if possible, so 233.84, if you're super bullish, anything like that, that's what you're"
"20780490","20800020"," looking for, this is the expected move right here, and then"
"20800020","20816870"," we've got this one right"
"20816870","20831300"," here for the downside, move this back here, now I"
"20831300","20836440"," got dang it, pink tight here, the wrong one's going on here, There's a little more here."
"20837340","20838860"," Mic, mic, mic, mic, mic, mic. "
"20847050","20848630"," 2,10, 85."
"20858810","20859830"," Close enough."
"20863750","20864490"," Solid. "
"20866370","20866910"," 11."
"20872630","20875330"," This is your pivot point right here."
"20883230","20888590"," yellow and we'll make this 12 maybe maybe a little bigger 16. "
"20913900","20942490"," Then we're gonna snap our support one is 20604, 20295, and"
"20942490","20944330"," 19815."
"20949380","20957820"," So this looks like it's somewhat in RTX and RTX to the upside and downside."
"20959020","20962940"," We've got upside targets of 21394. "
"20969310","20970910"," I'll tell you what I'm gonna build."
"20971110","20972610"," I guess we get closer to right."
"20974530","20982290"," I guess do that whenever I hold calls into this fucking closes I'm always disappointed. "
"20985170","20986530"," 21394, 21875."
"20992340","20993360"," Right there."
"20994440","20995840"," And then 220184. "
"21000870","21002370"," That's your last one."
"21002890","21005990"," Now we'll do S1, S2, S3."
"21015210","21022690"," These fucking, I mean this looks to me like, this looks to me like these, this looks like the"
"21022690","21025670"," dealers have priced this and I'm not gonna lie here. "
"21026790","21033810"," Unless you get something really crazy, an upside and downside target looks possible."
"21036570","21044070"," At least on the downside move here on a 30-minute basis the zigzag chills line up with the zigzag"
"21044070","21050030"," chills line up with a 30-minute basis down here at this expected move."
"21050890","21058690"," So I'm a little concerned here that the dealers have"
"21058690","21061470"," are gonna torch. "
"21062290","21069930"," If I had to guess here the dealers are gonna torch most expected or most of, I mean unless there's"
"21069930","21075540"," something completely unknown, not priced in, they've got the upside and downside."
"21078640","21084180"," There's got to be like a gang of creepy old white guys that are just all over this."
"21084400","21085700"," They're, they've been all over this. "
"21085800","21087600"," No one's been taken to the cleaners here today."
"21092500","21095020"," And let's see if I can, let's see if I can predict this one."
"21095380","21104630"," Now don't hold me to this but, and I'm long right now. "
"21104690","21106910"," I'm in calls here for the 26th."
"21106950","21111290"," So let's see if there's any kind of prediction here."
"21111570","21130590"," So where's 4 p.m. 325"
"21130590","21131770"," right now. "
"21132710","21134430"," We can scale this out a little bit."
"21139370","21140630"," We're below the pivots."
"21140630","21141890"," We've got to cross to the downside. "
"21151220","21157500"," I am going to go with, I am going to go with blood."
"21157500","21167840"," And I think you're going to tag, let"
"21167840","21169220"," me see one more one here."
"21177930","21181970"," So I do think you're going to tag your downside expected move after the bell. "
"21182190","21185970"," I think your ER is going to come in less than stellar."
"21190400","21196360"," And then I think the guidance is going to be positive."
"21196740","21197260"," I don't know. "
"21197280","21198440"," I don't know what time the guidance is."
"21198560","21199620"," I'm assuming it's later on."
"21200660","21202300"," Six o'clock or something like that. "
"21203400","21209080"," I think by open tomorrow that we open flat."
"21224440","21228080"," That's what I think happens into this close."
"21229000","21231220"," It sucks to say that but that's what I think happens. "
"21231400","21234520"," I think we're going to get rampant selling."
"21235800","21239340"," There'll be an intent here by shorts to get that last bloodbath."
"21240000","21244300"," You're going to get a decent, like not, I don't think you're going to get a big hit or miss"
"21244300","21246340"," on Tesla that's unexpected. "
"21247160","21252260"," And then I think you're going to come flying back up here once the guidance is released."
"21252540","21261980"," I think that Elon, if I need to guess, Elon is going to push true self driving, real self driving"
"21261980","21263540"," in this guidance."
"21264520","21265760"," I think it's going to make it rip. "
"21266540","21269200"," But I think the dealers are going to pin it if they can."
"21269480","21270700"," Now I will say this."
"21272180","21281940"," If price is able to get above that red box right there and hold, you could see shorts"
"21281940","21285820"," and some deep shit on the open tomorrow. "
"21286080","21292220"," So if you're able to get up here and hold this by open could be good for the bulls."
"21293220","21302340"," So you want to see the opening price tomorrow above 233.84. But I do think you bleed off and"
"21302340","21302660"," down."
"21302940","21305180"," You hit, you tagged that expected move to the downside. "
"21306200","21314520"," Now be aware that if we break below that 195 dealers will chase and amplify the downside move"
"21314520","21319160"," on spoo or on Tesla tomorrow."
"21319340","21322600"," Now we're at 190 right now too, right?"
"21323600","21329260"," This is a negative for, this is a negative for the market and for Tesla."
"21330160","21333200"," And that is that we just traded, I just say 190. "
"21334040","21339520"," We just traded 490 on SPY."
"21340880","21345020"," So if I had to guess there's someone out there wants to set the market up."
"21346040","21350700"," And someone wants to set the market up for even more blood,"
"21351200","21361080"," even more 160, 180 and then"
"21361080","21361440"," 165. "
"21362760","21371440"," So I am fascinated here to see if Tesla will be used as an excuse to sell the market."
"21372320","21373560"," Okay, to sell the market."
"21373840","21380400"," So I'm not too optimistic right here. "
"21385530","21389430"," Yeah, Nino man, I meant to answer your question earlier bro."
"21390310","21403810"," Nino here tracks all the other EV companies and synthetically"
"21403810","21404730"," trades them."
"21406990","21408430"," There's a trap here. "
"21408790","21411530"," There's, I'm going to tell you, I mean, look, look at spooze right now."
"21412150","21415730"," Spooze is sitting on a rug pull, right?"
"21415830","21415990"," Look at it."
"21416050","21416530"," It's a rug pull. "
"21417250","21422250"," It's almost like they're planning this right here on close imbalance, currently sitting at 380"
"21422250","21424250"," million to the south side."
"21425930","21430070"," We'll leave this, see this little, this little marker right here."
"21432210","21435830"," And I'm also going to, I'm going to turn that off. "
"21437430","21439510"," And I'm going to turn that off."
"21439790","21440650"," Oh, no, turn that off."
"21442390","21445330"," Yeah, turn all that up and that one off and that one off. "
"21446150","21450350"," And I'm in a way to focus on this 4850 down below."
"21450810","21454010"," Okay, 4850 and then 4824 and SPX."
"21454910","21463970"," If we bleed down into this, if we bleed down into this, this major gamma level down here at 4852"
"21463970","21465270"," or 4050. "
"21465670","21473270"," But even more so, just like maybe a V shape down here before open tomorrow at 4824."
"21474250","21479990"," If things go sideways or wrong, I'm also going to move, I'm going to change this one."
"21480470","21483570"," Do you guys want to do this, the cues or you know what we can do is we'll do a"
"21483570","21484290"," double screener. "
"21485350","21488790"," We'll do a double boner as they say, which is a chicken wing."
"21490350","21492770"," Let's see if I can make this a little boner here."
"21493510","21493570"," Boom. "
"21494770","21496530"," And we're going to switch this to spy."
"21498650","21499130"," SPY."
"21500870","21501350"," SPY. "
"21501770","21503170"," Get a little bit of slowdown here."
"21504010","21505730"," Turn some of this stuff off in the background."
"21507370","21509590"," Here's SPY in a one minute chart down below. "
"21511470","21513150"," Oh, are we getting that blood, huh?"
"21513470","21516370"," See that blood that we're getting right now."
"21518710","21520990"," I'm going to move this over right now."
"21520990","21526470"," We are now underneath the hourly trigger on S&P 500. "
"21526470","21527550"," Let me make this a little bit smaller."
"21533080","21534380"," Let's see, you can see it at home."
"21537740","21539340"," And what am I going to do here?"
"21539640","21541100"," Let me get rid of some sloppiness here. "
"21545180","21550320"," And just a word of warning here that on spy at least, here."
"21563580","21564200"," I'll show that over."
"21566860","21575200"," On spy now, trading underneath its hourly trigger and we have a small cross forming, a bearish"
"21575200","21577340"," cross forming right now above. "
"21577800","21581800"," So if you look at the bottom left hand side of your screen, we have a half hour trigger running"
"21581800","21583400"," down over the hourly trigger."
"21583640","21585380"," This is pretty bearish, this setup here."
"21586020","21587420"," Be really careful here. "
"21587600","21589780"," Really, really careful here."
"21591040","21599900"," There is a market is being positioned to sell the fuck out of the market is positioned for Tesla to"
"21599900","21602200"," sell on any bad news."
"21603660","21605140"," We're going to do the cues. "
"21617060","21618960"," QQQ one minute chart over here."
"21621480","21625580"," Cues parked on its hourly trigger, not as bearish as spy looks."
"21629040","21632960"," And let me know what you think is going to happen here. "
"21633180","21634380"," Let me know what your thoughts are."
"21634460","21637020"," If you want to know, some of you guys are voted, some of you guys didn't."
"21637980","21645020"," I think we're weak into this close and we catch a bounce. "
"21654380","21657060"," If you want to say something or whatever you want to say about."
"21659260","21661740"," Yeah, there's another aspect to this too."
"21661940","21669520"," If you're already short Tesla, here's here's an event to flush it, like to max out your shorts,"
"21669540","21669940"," right?"
"21670080","21670760"," Just like Netflix. "
"21671220","21675320"," Netflix yesterday was looking for a reason to go up, right?"
"21675660","21677320"," I was looking for a reason to monetize, right?"
"21677540","21680800"," Last breakthrough 500 cash out on Netflix."
"21681280","21683660"," If you're a fucking hedge fund, you're like, whoo, we did it."
"21683800","21684380"," We're so smart. "
"21685140","21686260"," You know, they're not really smart."
"21686440","21689100"," They're just positioned to make that money, right?"
"21690760","21694180"," And move that right there."
"21696580","21698320"," You know, the rigged market, right?"
"21710660","21715360"," Yeah, I went the way that the expected move is the way the expected move is here. "
"21716020","21721900"," I would not be shocked to see us like hit the downside target, hit the upside target and then be"
"21721900","21722740"," flat tomorrow."
"21723160","21724080"," Nobody voted for flat."
"21724820","21734040"," And then what they do is just the murder bot comes in and just destroys put holders, call holders. "
"21735240","21736240"," Thank you for playing."
"21736820","21741100"," Come back on the 27th and place your bets again."
"21741760","21749460"," They vacuum up the event and you see some doom and gloom and spews and then spews comes back by"
"21749460","21749860"," tomorrow. "
"21750360","21759380"," And then of course, you'll hear CNBC come out and say stupid ship or dare to claim their naval"
"21759380","21762180"," forces directly here to US military ship."
"21763840","21765020"," Uh oh, what was that?"
"21768350","21769990"," They say US ship took a hit."
"21770810","21772230"," Did you guys hear that just now?"
"21775760","21778200"," I think I just heard that from macro headline. "
"21778500","21780680"," I saw it just heard a US ship got hit now."
"21780680","21783600"," Only $99 a year for our real time service."
"21786100","21787300"," Did you guys hear that?"
"21790320","21793980"," Yeah, I think I might have heard a US ship just got hit, but I'm not positive. "
"21795920","21797460"," Thank you, poke juice box."
"21797980","21799040"," First squawk."
"21799520","21802740"," Two minutes ago, Yemen's Houthis. "
"21803260","21808600"," Naval forces carried out operation against number of US military ships with ballistic missiles in"
"21808600","21809660"," the oh shit."
"21811910","21815010"," Dude, we are going to fuck them up."
"21815630","21817950"," We do who these are fucked, dude. "
"21819130","21829610"," You know, you know, like that, uh, the the that's bait meme from from, uh, that's"
"21829610","21830450"," bait right there."
"21831750","21835270"," I need to know how many people I didn't know how bad that was."
"21835270","21836750"," I was in the army, dude. "
"21836830","21838490"," We are going to fuck them up."
"21838610","21841050"," I'm whether that's the right thing or wrong thing to do."
"21843030","21843530"," Dude. "
"21844910","21845890"," Oh, man."
"21848290","21852390"," Yeah, whether you agree that that should or should not happen."
"21852970","21853470"," Uh. "
"21855690","21857170"," Oh, man, dude."
"21858330","21862430"," I got I got a I got a if anybody hears anything else about that."
"21862430","21870850"," Uh, right now, if you could just if you give me an update at some point, uh, dude. "
"21875620","21882620"," If you if you do like if you're saying it's open season on US, it is it's weird too because"
"21882620","21891440"," there's like a, um, there's a, um, we were we were we were talking on the show recently."
"21892800","21898540"," We were talking and I want to let you guys know something on this topic with the Houthis."
"21899220","21904120"," Uh, you will not see an initial you likely will not see an initial reaction by the market to this"
"21904120","21905600"," until after the report. "
"21907140","21913980"," You should see a reaction not until not until these hedge funds do their thing."
"21914560","21916820"," Uh, and I'm actually going to turn bullish here."
"21916820","21921600"," Uh, for a squeeze higher so that we can go down on the Houthi news. "
"21921760","21927080"," I think I'm actually going to turn turn kind of bullish here for the, um, uh, for the Houthi news."
"21929940","21930460"," Dude."
"21930460","21933800"," You know, it's like one thing to attack some soldiers, but you attack. "
"21934160","21936380"," We're last week we're discussing on the show."
"21937700","21943840"," About this standoff of the US governor, my Clinton says we expect to see evidence that inflation"
"21943840","21944560"," will ease."
"21947020","21951940"," Uh, that the US naval forces were standoffish because it did look very baity. "
"21952480","21956860"," Uh, like bait to expand the war and this this will do it right here."
"21956960","21958220"," This is this is how you do it."
"21959340","21961500"," Uh, this is most certainly how you do it. "
"21965200","21966960"," Okay, so you're saying they were intercepted?"
"21968360","21971220"," Yeah, hootie and the blowfish dude is so fucked."
"21971760","21975300"," So, but if they actually hit a ship with real damage."
"21977220","21979120"," Let me read, read some stuff to you here. "
"21980280","21981400"," We got 20 minutes anyways."
"21981640","21986980"," Houthi's shoot missiles at ships in response to Israel's genocidal attacks on Gaza and turn the US"
"21986980","21989700"," and UK air forces bombed eight military sites in Yemen."
"21990400","21992100"," Marking the eighth time in two weeks. "
"21992440","21996860"," POTUS says bombings haven't deterred the Houthis, but US, UK will still continue to bomb Yemen."
"21997920","22000520"," Uh, US and UK haven't been able to gather popular support."
"22000780","22001700"," Uh, it doesn't say anything. "
"22002340","22010400"," Uh, Yemen's Houthis, naval forces carried out operation against number of US military ships with"
"22010400","22012940"," ballistic missiles and the Gulf of Aden."
"22014580","22018740"," Uh, set their saying naval forces directly hit."
"22019020","22021020"," So we're looking again at the US military ship. "
"22021220","22025100"," Enbalanced, still sitting at 380 million to the south side."
"22030580","22031760"," God damn dude."
"22032180","22038320"," I want you to understand something. "
"22038460","22040880"," The ships, the Houthis are attacking our commercial ships."
"22041200","22042040"," These ships usually stop."
"22042280","22048560"," And of course, then, uh, I can't, I can't, um, whoever this person is is not a trusted source. "
"22049020","22051920"," I don't know if it's a naval ship or a civilian ship."
"22052300","22054100"," Some people are saying naval ship here."
"22060940","22063880"," We got some fucking clowns saying long live Yemen. "
"22065380","22068220"," Do you guys know that Yemen's flag says death to America?"
"22068220","22069180"," Do you guys know that?"
"22069200","22070780"," Do you guys know about a Yemen's flag?"
"22072260","22074200"," It says death to America."
"22077140","22079320"," You know, I'm on Elon Musk with this."
"22081060","22089740"," Uh, the Houthis warned ships they're going to attack and give them the opportunity to leave"
"22089740","22091080"," according to Zionists. "
"22091420","22093860"," Israel warns that civilians, they're going to bomb their house."
"22094580","22098780"," I don't know, uh, there's a Yemeni, Yemeni Navy warning that went out."
"22098860","22099880"," I'm not going to play it here. "
"22100000","22101900"," I don't, I'm"
"22101900","22120740"," just"
"22120740","22123840"," going to play it."
"22123840","22125060"," I'm just going to play it here."
"22127700","22128480"," This goes. "
"22136900","22138180"," Let's see what they got here."
"22140920","22141780"," Let's see, nothing."
"22143820","22147060"," Nothing that I can, nothing that I can comment on at the moment. "
"22147500","22148520"," Nothing that's like directly."
"22151200","22155220"," What you should do is I could call a family member and find out if they're going to lock down."
"22162920","22167820"," There's some really mixed reporting going on right now. "
"22168640","22171340"," Some people are reporting that's only a commercial ship."
"22172780","22175720"," The Houthis attack, US container ship."
"22177020","22179640"," And the USS gravely defends. "
"22180440","22183560"," I don't know, there seems to be a lot of sloppy reporting going on right now."
"22185640","22187740"," I'm going to leave that where it is."
"22187740","22190860"," I'm not going to comment on this until something more confirmed comes out. "
"22199600","22200440"," What's going on?"
"22200640","22201920"," Recovering bear, bear hauling."
"22202100","22202580"," How are you doing, man?"
"22202620","22204780"," We got set up right now, the Tesla chart."
"22206540","22208360"," We have a..."
"22208860","22211140"," This is the Tesla ER chart here. "
"22211400","22212620"," I'll actually write this in."
"22213340","22213600"," Tesla."
"22219540","22220020"," Tesla. "
"22223420","22224860"," Just for your fun."
"22225000","22227340"," You guys want to see me get raked over."
"22227340","22229660"," I got 10 grand riding on this trade, by the way. "
"22232120","22238760"," I got trapped $10,000 in calls on Tesla."
"22240520","22244260"," I got let out on Monday and I did not close."
"22245340","22249040"," I was looking for 235, they didn't give it to me. "
"22252660","22256140"," So we've got the expected move in green and yellow."
"22257520","22263160"," We have the daily and weekly and monthly above the expected move here."
"22263800","22266040"," Foles need to be above and hold 233. "
"22268500","22277740"," The expected move in the market here is pretty well covered unless there's some major unknown news."
"22282310","22284390"," Here we'll do a watch."
"22285590","22291050"," We did a poll earlier and people were very divided. "
"22291990","22293310"," They did not."
"22295250","22296610"," They were very divided."
"22296910","22301010"," They said everybody was on one side or the other down or up. "
"22301590","22307050"," I'm going with open flat tomorrow and torch everybody."
"22311990","22314270"," We'll do Tesla or Tesla boo."
"22317350","22319170"," Like Homer Simpson does. "
"22319370","22320990"," Now to the early market on close imbalance."

"23826880","23835740"," this might be this might be like the third like the third time I've bought calls on Tesla into an"
"23835740","23841940"," ER and I've gotten torched some I'm kind of hoping we try I hope kind of hope we open flat"

"23866640","23876060"," like IBM right had good earnings some mixed bag but they're monetizing on the upside Tesla might be"
"23876060","23884040"," monetizing to the downside right monetizing to the downside for a nice downside run and we might"
"23884040","23900980"," open flat tomorrow guys New York guys and gals I think that's possibility remember I said flat yeah"
"23900980","23907620"," I'm not a fan of him in earnings he's had a few good moments but he's had a lot of"
"23907620","23914040"," bad moments to in ER calls like it's like please do just be quiet he's got well he gets frustrated"
"23914040","23919160"," right and then he it's like I'm gonna sit in the earnings call and then of course there's one"
"23919160","23926340"," there's one reporter that's like I know exactly what to ask to set his ass off right now right I"
"23926340","23936280"," prepared for him to take this question right now a little bit of recovery"
"23936280","23942360"," here in Tesla a little bit of profit taking right now and IBM still would expect it to be green"
"23942360","23951640"," tomorrow cues recovering right now I'm glad I at least took the month that one penny I had on 486"
"23951640","23956240"," they're now worth fucking zero I'm glad I took quick if that thing actually goes like two cents"
"23956240","23961380"," will be pissed let's see what Joey's saying right now here let me bring up Joe here let me see"
"23961380","23968960"," me get Joe in the line before we before we stop the stream let's see if he answers maybe we"
"23968960","23993760"," can get him the chime in here all right"
"23993760","24000920"," so before we end the stream we got Joe Joey donut this guy's a Tesla bull and he actually knows"
"24000920","24009020"," quite a bit about the heat he follows Tesla very closely so Joe why do we put ourselves through"
"24009020","24018520"," this as I sit here driving this shitty car the Tesla you're driving yes"
"24018520","24030140"," honestly I don't know what the hell I was doing playing Tesla calls on I have not had a successful"
"24030140","24038880"," successful options trade on Tesla earnings and dude it's been a few cycles as it is it's been a"
"24038880","24046320"," long time with the pull down they had in the distance they have from their monthly and weekly"
"24046320","24054460"," indicators at this point I was like you know Tesla's due for a rip up to the monthly and then"
"24054460","24060340"," a rejection and then we could go down and get some real price discovery on Tesla yes I was playing"
"24060340","24069020"," for that but you know people were saying you know like I don't have Elon on the call is he"
"24069020","24073040"," gonna be on the call because he said a long time ago he was gonna be on fewer calls but"
"24073040","24079200"," then he lied he's on the line then he lied yeah so I don't know if he is on the"
"24079200","24087000"," call I that's very bearish to me because honestly Elon does well on the call when he has something"
"24087000","24094800"," very positive yep new and deliverable to talk about and I would say right now"
"24094800","24104540"," the only thing he's gonna get is frustrated with the questions from analysts"
"24104540","24114220"," on the call about delayed deliveries and missed deadlines and you know full self "
"24114220","24120380","-driving having its moment and you know a car driving itself all the way across the country with no"
"24120380","24128540"," interventions and all that bullshit and so I think he'll just get frustrated and angry and give all"
"24128540","24136060"," the analysts the reason to say Tesla's earnings call was a just disjointed mess do you think that"
"24136060","24144280"," it would benefit Elon if the price was low for him to own more shares"
"24144280","24154160"," we've discussed this so Elon has stated rather clearly on his platform that"
"24154160","24162580"," he wishes to own at least a quarter of the company in order to develop AI and create you know"
"24162580","24169880"," the potential for an AGI agent to be developed in Tesla or whatever yeah which on the face sounds"
"24169880","24179740"," like a benevolent you know if someone looking to safeguard the future and all this but"
"24179740","24185760"," when you look at what he really is saying this is not the money I don't think anyone could say"
"24185760","24193560"," that you know Elon Musk is looking you know to live in the life of the guy wearing gold chains"
"24193560","24199620"," and you know buying small countries because he doesn't own shit he just doesn't care I think he"
"24199620","24207680"," likes the power and he is now at a place where at less than 13% of Tesla which is"
"24207680","24215460"," what he currently owns given all the divestitures had to do because of his debacle with Twitter he"
"24215460","24222620"," sees himself as vulnerable and I think he wants more of a percentage so that he can be better"
"24222620","24230660"," protected and protect his family members on the board of Tesla on which his family members make up"
"24230660","24239520"," a good bit of the board and friends and friends so I you know I think I think that why"
"24239520","24248560"," he is a complaint that includes and he was looking for a complaint that includes a lot of you know"
"24248560","24255380"," options that he could exercise but if he were to get to a place where he was able to exercise"
"24255380","24261360"," options if anyone remembers when he was investing and once again this is why I've been doing this"
"24261360","24268060"," shit way too long on Tesla yep anybody really remembers when he was besting his what everyone"
"24268060","24274400"," called an absolutely ridiculous comp plan back in the day where he was getting you know awarded"
"24274400","24279720"," billions and billions of dollars worth of stock people were getting pissed because it was causing"
"24279720","24288880"," price action issues while he was selling huge slots of Tesla to raise money to be able to exercise"
"24288880","24298280"," his options because he still had to buy the options even a ridiculously low price"
"24298280","24303560"," he still had to exercise the options which cost money you know if you're exercising option for"
"24303560","24309700"," hundred shares no big deal we exercise an option for you know 500 million shares it's quite a big"
"24309700","24318780"," deal so I would just say that that the the"
"24318780","24328660"," the chance that he would be cheerleading a drop in Tesla stock because money doesn't matter so much"
"24328660","24337880"," to him percentage ownership matters to him and he figures that stock price is negotiable but"
"24337880","24346560"," percent ownership is is key so taking one a high stock price is an impediment to percentage"
"24346560","24355860"," ownership looks like buyers are stepping in right now in the half hour at least there's a real war"
"24355860","24365420"," going on in the half-hour bar do you think that there's some questions of him also"
"24365420","24375220"," there's a secondary reason for him to be awarded more shares or to pay for the"
"24375220","24385170"," buying of Twitter I mean that's that is the problem here let's be honest that's"
"24385170","24392730"," the that's the elephant in the room right Twitter he ultimately didn't want to have bought Twitter"
"24392730","24402330"," but he did he I think he did all of this as a joke in the original"
"24402330","24408470"," in the beginning he did it out of bluster and in the end he did it out of spite and"
"24408470","24417570"," then he was forced out of you know the chance really core in Delaware saying don't get to do"
"24417570","24427310"," whatever they want to do what you said ultimately he now is having to deal with those"
"24427310","24437050"," consequences but ultimately it's cost him the kind of unquestionable control of Tesla"
"24437050","24445570"," it's it's put him in an awkward position for a guy that really enjoys being able to say whatever he"
"24445570","24454130"," wants and get the board to do whatever he wants that Tesla's you know ownership now he had to sell"
"24454130","24460970"," a lot of shares in the open market when he was being forced to divestify Twitter and I don't know"
"24460970","24464510"," that there's a solution aside from the board assigning him a bunch of shares"
"24464510","24474230"," to give his"
"24474230","24482750"," private holdings in SpaceX because that's where all of his money is SpaceX and Tesla and Twitter"
"24482750","24487030"," well his money's in Twitter but the value's not in Twitter because there's not a lot of value there"
"24487030","24494390"," relative to what he spent right yeah so he dropped forty four billion dollars into Twitter or he"
"24494390","24499830"," dropped the majority of forty four billion dollars into Twitter and he pulled out you know I don't"
"24499830","24509110"," know what ten so maybe less probably less so at this point you know what where can you go to"
"24509110","24516750"," the piggy bank if it's not Tesla's board then it's got to be you know shares and companies that are"
"24516750","24526490"," like like Twitter or SpaceX do you think that there's any potential for a"
"24526490","24535630"," positive guidance honestly looking at the macro environment that we're in right now"
"24535630","24542950"," and I don't know I follow the car dealership guy on Twitter yeah I've got a lot of good he's"
"24542950","24550050"," got a lot of good insights into the auto industry yep you know all he's talked about all week long"
"24550050","24557950"," is huge chains of dealerships that have literally shut down since the first of the year as we sit"
"24557950","24565950"," on the 24th day of January I would say that he's announced at least two separate over you know like"
"24565950","24574030"," like 20 20 dealership chains that have folded up due to the difficulties used in new car"
"24574030","24583050"," financing and costs and so I don't know that the macro environment for autos is great"
"24583050","24591870"," 24 but they did say that there was a brief note release saying that Tesla does expect a major"
"24591870","24601310"," downturn in the next year for demand yeah so I mean that's that can't be good for"
"24601310","24606070"," you know for outlooks but yeah you got to price that in and then right then beat those expectations"
"24606070","24613970"," that could be a positive catalyst I guess and their next dr reports if they're if they're"
"24613970","24620310"," downgrading themselves right now so what the hell am I doing in February calls for Tesla to be"
"24620310","24628230"," honest after having this conversation with you it was literally an expectation of poor pain for"
"24628230","24633710"," Tesla but to get more pain I was at the impression that we were likely to go up and grab"
"24633710","24637810"," some more than yes that's what I would like to see here I'd like to see the I'd like to"
"24637810","24645090"," see these dealers sit here and run it up if we don't get any more bearish news later tonight or"
"24645090","24650930"," anything like that and maybe make it nice and flat it I guess the worst part here too is they're"
"24650930","24654570"," following the close if you as can with these markets just going to give you guys a quick market"
"24654570","24660750"," wrap up the session today if you don't if we don't get tonight some kind of like pump show just"
"24660750","24666670"," the IV is just gonna bleed the fuck off but tassel here it'll just languish US stock indexes ended"
"24666670","24672690"," today off session highs after earnings related optimism filled by Netflix moderated and investors"
"24672690","24678950"," geared up for another batch of key quarterly results so the S&P 500 was little changed when markets"
"24678950","24686010"," closed with the take heavy NASDAQ 100 jumping spot 5% treasury yields rose with the 30-year rate"
"24686010","24697590"," climbing to its highest level so far this year the dollar trimmed earlier declines earlier today"
"24697590","24702550"," as well the bank of Canada held its key interest rate at 5% as expected and signal that it"

"24708550","24714230"," bond yields slip earlier after day to show the business activity contract in January for the eight"
"24714230","24721970"," month let's be honest all of those things I just said are priced into the stock yep so you know"
"24721970","24730810"," we need a catalyst and you know it may be a $25,000 car but let's be honest timelines when"
"24730810","24739130"," would they price in a $25,000 car when Elon says we're gonna launch a vehicle you know yeah you've"
"24739130","24746190"," got a you know the decade but you know we're still it's like what is four years six years like"
"24746190","24754750"," yeah like the the chances of any of us surviving to see it is low and some people in your"
"24754750","24762690"," audience are like you know under 18 so it's it's not good there's still waiting on a roadster we're"
"24762690","24768530"," still waiting on a semi to actually get wide release and the cyber truck still being made pretty"
"24768530","24778190"," slowly tax use the so we launch a new huge"
"24778190","24782810"," initiative for Tesla on the earnings call which isn't gonna happen because that's not how he does"
"24782810","24790730"," it Tesla launches new initiatives in you know a night dedicated to it and they bring in all the"
"24790730","24797790"," ultra you know fanboys and everyone cheers and all that even those are starting to get a little"
"24797790","24805310"," like quieter and less exciting less of dude the last one they had is very subdued it was quick I"
"24805310","24811510"," was shocked it ended as fast as it did yeah so I mean at this point you know we're getting"
"24811510","24817950"," we're getting diminishing returns on finishing returns Tesla need the huge win and unexpected win"
"24817950","24822610"," yeah and I don't know what that is on the on the horizon I don't believe you and I talked"
"24822610","24828870"," about it earlier you know I paid for the full self-driving for my car so I'm like the you"
"24828870","24837070"," know the the top self-driving software and all that and as a person who's been driving with it for"
"24837070","24846090"," years and various Teslas you know waiting to see what you're gonna admit to right now there"
"24846090","24855970"," is no moment as I said with you today it's going to happen for full self-driving it's not I"
"24855970","24861670"," don't care who the fuck you are or what you say or how big of a fan you are or"
"24861670","24870070"," how much you read whole Mars catalog or shit there is no I'm on my self-driving interview there is"
"24870070","24878650"," only iterative better iteratively better every version yeah and you know it we're going to you know"
"24878650","24883850"," for the people out there that have ever experienced it that maybe don't know but the full self "
"24883850","24890090","-driving software has gotten better every single release I get I'm on the beta I get all of the"
"24890090","24895890"," newest releases it gets better it gets better in better but let's say it's like say we've literally"
"24895890","24901890"," had this conversation you and I yep but let's say it's 50% is to use human driver right and"
"24901890","24910630"," the next release it's gonna be literally 20% better than the last release yeah like"
"24910630","24918610"," we can get 20% better than the last release and almost infinite number of times is still not be"
"24918610","24925770"," as good as the human driver so it's got to have an aha moment or it's going to get iteratively"
"24925770","24935770"," better over the years and at some point decades from now it'll be good enough or yeah exactly yeah"
"24935770","24945190"," over time roads will change to accommodate to accommodate this type of stuff but but there isn't"
"24945190","24955030"," gonna be like a click click moment for you know for Tesla self-driving suddenly go to version 12 or"
"24955030","24960990"," version 13 it's fire it literally is better than the best driver you know there's never gonna"
"24960990","24969870"," happen not with the roads being the way they are and whereas you know iteratively getting better I"
"24969870","24976570"," mean we got it's always incremental it's always it's always incremental it's never like damn whoa"
"24976570","24982990"," yeah so it's not gonna be like oh once we get to a billion miles because we got a billion"
"24982990","24988210"," miles it's like okay well once we get to 10 billion miles driven we'll have enough data it's like"
"24988210","24995130"," we're at 10 billion miles we're more than that I think at this point on Tesla so you know it's"
"24995130","25005070"," it's not a it's not a big data problem it's not a compute cluster problem I don't think that we're"
"25005070","25010790"," like it is the aha moment the aha moment's not coming from more data the aha moment's not coming"
"25010790","25020630"," from or compute the aha moment isn't coming from better code base it's literally it's kind of like"
"25020630","25025770"," one of those things where we reach some kind of new axiom of like a Moore's law type thing it's"
"25025770","25031430"," gonna get this much better every 12 months and it's just gonna keep getting better but it's not"
"25031430","25038850"," like it's not like one day we suddenly discovered fire or one day it's not a discovery it's an"
"25038850","25045630"," iteratively better right that I guess the time is coming at it right now so the aha moments with AI"
"25045630","25053470"," being rolled into FSD right yeah it's not gonna live up to the hype that's being pushed on that"
"25053470","25061750"," narrative either nor will it happen immediately I don't know I'm interested in listening to the I"
"25061750","25067910"," don't know when that begins when the call begins but I do want to listen to it are you gonna"

"25212620","25220680"," Elon has changed like it's like the change Apple did from from like Steve to Tim Cook but the"
"25220680","25227660"," problem is is Tesla didn't get the CEO change they just got his focus change like now but and"
"25227660","25233180"," they're not operating like an Apple where Apple found a way to like become a money pump and just"
"25233180","25241420"," seriously godly revenue but they're doing it from like iterative products like Tesla has changed to"
"25241420","25248120"," iterative products but without the revenue pump that Apple install and that doesn't work like you"
"25248120","25254400"," gotta if you're no longer going to be blowing people's minds off with the technology you're"
"25254400","25264660"," creating the better of found a way to turn it into a cash pump yep okay 530 p.m. is"
"25264660","25270340"," the earnings call thank you Bumbledine for getting that note for that time frame so I am gonna"
"25270340","25275180"," watch tonight hopefully Joe you get a chance to watch I appreciate you showing up today taking some"
"25275180","25282220"," time out of your day dude I'm pissed right now because I do this every fucking we're not every but"
"25282220","25290280"," past dude like dropping like dropping lotos on Tesla has been pretty fucking bad man pretty fucking"
"25290280","25294820"," bad in history dude when you said that today I was like this is this is my experience here with"
"25294820","25306680"," this shit I"
"25306680","25311000"," always feel like I owe this for so much of how much money I've made off Tesla like I'll just"
"25311000","25319720"," throw some more money just giving money back to the house every single damn time because I walked"
"25319720","25325520"," with a bunch but I've paid taxes on that shit yeah exactly it's not as at this point I'm like"
"25325520","25335520"," yeah no more no more donations super Tesla gods right yeah well you can't thanks for listening"
"25335520","25343660"," to me rant and you know pray for my my February calls for Tesla well I'm hoping I am hoping"
"25343660","25350000"," that we can tag this 221 if we can tag 223 but even on the opening belt of ID is"
"25350000","25357400"," just gonna get murdered so I'm not seeing any calls getting paid on tomorrow's open unless there is"
"25357400","25366980"," something like mind-blowing like a mind-blowing blowjob some kind so well big cute boy in the chat"
"25366980","25375980"," saying what about optimus and the robots and all that I I think the robots have potential but once"
"25375980","25384460"," again on Tesla timescales when that goes into scale production and when it is fast enough and"
"25384460","25393280"," useful enough to be used for you know for the actual market as a whole I'm putting that in years"
"25393280","25401820"," half decade minimum minimum like like when are they gonna start using it in the assembly line to"
"25401820","25407000"," like practice and test with it dude they could do they were doing that now I'm sure and you know"
"25407000","25414780"," that's awesome and it looks really good but at this point Tesla's in filming mode yep and I want to"
"25414780","25422360"," see them say we got an order for a hundred thousand optimisms at manufacturing facilities across"
"25422360","25427960"," the country at that point I'll be like okay and we're gonna fill it in 2025 they say that shit"
"25427960","25435620"," yeah okay let's get on board we'll ride that way but I believe that the optimus that you will see"
"25435620","25445220"," come out is likely between five and ten years away from commercialization we're talking"
"25445220","25454120"," untethered where they can't do damage to humans or just yeah it's ruled out in the way where you're"
"25454120","25460400"," seeing Tesla semis on the road every day all day agreed instead of a few of them running free"
"25460400","25467880"," routes I mean I'm big and when optimus is being launched and it's taking up room and Amazon"
"25467880","25475420"," warehouses or you know it's taking up room in manufacturing facilities where a person used to not"
"25475420","25482240"," just in a place where it's like high visibility so they can use it as marketing but like where the"
"25482240","25488380"," manufacturer down the street review is gonna be like yeah I'm gonna place an order today like that"
"25488380","25496800"," I think is five to ten years or more and there's other there's other issues on that too man like"
"25496800","25503200"," there's the robotics that is it tethered at that point still is it locked behind a four by four"
"25503200","25513080"," area where it can't kill somebody like plexiglass some people are saying that stuff's still 25-50"
"25513080","25520300"," years away yeah I mean we're gonna do we're gonna get the same it's the same thing as with slightly"
"25520300","25526620"," lower stakes because in this case instead of full self-driving where you're going to you know where"
"25526620","25532560"," you're going to literally run into a school bus full of children you know an optimus if you look at"
"25532560","25538520"," them they don't move that fast they don't you know it's not it's not like it's not like a you"
"25538520","25544060"," know multi thousand pound car strapped with batteries driving down the road at 90 miles an hour so"
"25544060","25553040"," it's slightly less dangerous but that being said you know it's it's still it's too slow a human"
"25553040","25559020"," could outrun it right now I'd say a person can do the work in optimus in a perfect environment"
"25559020","25566580"," built literally for optimus doing the same work a person could do 10 days worth of optimus work in"
"25566580","25575020"," a day well that's not working so I don't think it's worth the the look of optimus like the look"
"25575020","25583120"," of optimus you could build a machine that doesn't that for right now to complete those tasks right"
"25583780","25589220"," that's tethered to some extent with no human interaction but we're built or he's building this one"
"25589220","25595280"," to you know put in a factory you can walk down the floor with and not be afraid of losing"
"25595280","25605120"," a limb yeah Tesla just said so often it's just gonna kill all the fat and all people that can't"
"25605120","25608960"," run faster than 4.5 miles an hour you know there's some so you guys out there that are watching"
"25608960","25612980"," right now there's a I'll try to find a name of this guy but there's a couple guys at MIT"
"25612980","25622600"," that are doing research on robotics and there's some real problems so for all the hype around AI"
"25622600","25632420"," robotics is about five times the time away from the jumps of AI right now robotics is root where"
"25632420","25641260"," the real problems are they're not problems but how do I explain that like like"
"25641260","25649280"," robotics is a much farther behind AI maybe five times every year that you think you're making"
"25649280","25654740"," progress is probably another an exponential not expensive but about five times as much behind in"
"25654740","25663320"," robotics and there's a bunch of what is the what is the bar to iterate in physical items like a"
"25663320","25669640"," robot versus in software right you can iterate very quickly yeah robot falls out of flight stairs"
"25669640","25677660"," robot gets caught on this human gets in the way even with so many it's a while I didn't realize"
"25677660","25686820"," how much I didn't realize how much farther robotics has to actually go to replace humans you got to"
"25686820","25696600"," look at like in a factory you got really 100% of them 100% of the"
"25696600","25703260"," robots in the factory that I've never seen that are like doing really useful tasks the environment"
"25703260","25710000"," of the factory is that fine to accommodate the robots so that it follows a line on the floor or"
"25710000","25718260"," so that it you know it has yeah so the docking tables where the materials are being transported"
"25718260","25724000"," from one side of the factory to the other have been built to accommodate the actual robot so I mean"
"25724000","25729500"," it's not it's not the promise that it's very effective it's very yeah it's not what we're being"
"25729500","25734680"," sold that's it's gonna just enter your world and just live there and it'll be able to do everything"
"25734680","25741280"," you do and like that that that is the dream and that is the future we all want and that"
"25741280","25748620"," is you know the future they're trying to sell you when they show you the but it's not the it's"
"25748620","25756080"," not the near future for in reality it's it's it's the tesla roadster 2.0 you know it's for years"
"25756080","25766040"," of becoming useful not like boom and unlike here's here's an"
"25766040","25775020"," important point when when you look at when you look at electric cars right incumbency in electric"
"25775020","25781840"," cars when tesla was growing and coming up and and developing their technology incumbency was non "
"25781840","25789920","-existent like there was nobody gm was not on the verge of launching an incredible lineup of"
"25789920","25799360"," electric cars and neither one's playing ever rolling out different companies so no one was on the"
"25799360","25805660"," verge of that and the other entrants that were like below Tesla were like you know you and me in"
"25805660","25811940"," a garage like really small and because because you know when it come out there with the full like"
"25811940","25817080"," we're gonna build infrastructure and the cars and you know we're gonna do it like that came at the"
"25817080","25822440"," right time and there was the right amount of incumbency which was zero so they were able to capture"
"25822440","25827920"," all the dollars being thrown at the problem at the time and that's why tesla was able to really"
"25827920","25837520"," kill it but in robots and automation of human tasks tesla will not find an empty space"
"25837520","25844160"," with no competitors there are a lot of people out there doing incredible things with automation and"
"25844160","25850900"," robots the difference is tesla needs excitement to keep the ball rolling right now yep and so"
"25850900","25857180"," they're out there you know you know doing the it's like poutier it's like poutier you need"
"25857180","25863820"," something that's tangible that people can get excited over and it's useful right now at this one"
"25863820","25867980"," it's like a crack cocaine or you don't want to say crack cocaine but it is kind of crack cocaine"
"25867980","25872800"," no it's like you know you look at Boston Dynamics they come out with a video like once every six"
"25872800","25878580"," months and it's always mind-blowing right like you like holy shit what is that the robot just did"
"25878580","25884740"," like a car wheel and like you know and and and a lot of other behind the watch games right"
"25884740","25890280"," right but for the most part you're only seeing the things they're ready to like show that they put"
"25890280","25896940"," their hands they are not yeah they're not really out there trying to keep people you know keep keep"
"25896940","25902280"," the fanboys in the stock like they're out there they're like hey maybe we don't show all of this"
"25902280","25908040"," and we keep developing quietly in the background because we have unlimited money from you know from"
"25908040","25916500"," Google but like those guys it's a totally different world so when Tesla does finally come out with"
"25916500","25924000"," something that is like commercially viable they're gonna be out there with a lot of other people"
"25924000","25931620"," with commercially viable solutions now no one would ever fight me or fight you on saying that Tesla"
"25931620","25940160"," will will have excellent in automation and production and that they will drive prices down the way"
"25940160","25948000"," they have in their electric cars they will they'll be able to manufacture armies of robots but"
"25948000","25954300"," that's not to say that no one else could and not to say that they'll have the best technology I"
"25954300","25963200"," mean that and and and also we're still like with the catch-up on EVs right now right yeah I"
"25963200","25968040"," mean well yeah so that's the difference right like the car companies that are trying to build EVs"
"25968040","25975200"," day didn't want to build EVs but the companies that are building robots today are watching what"
"25975200","25981020"," Tesla's doing and going absolutely we're gonna do that we have no doubts that you know that"
"25981020","25987020"," creating our own linear actuators that are not off the shelf is gonna make sense or that we can"
"25987020","25993660"," take advantage of the linear actuators that Tesla's making you know and then build them too so I"
"25993660","26001520"," mean they want solutions they're not fighting incumbency they don't have legacy investments in you"
"26001520","26006840"," know in transmission foundries that would become a zero if everything went to an electric car you"
"26006840","26012340"," know car tomorrow like GM did you know they don't care they're like absolutely burned this thing"
"26012340","26019640"," down we don't have a factory that we got an art that we're making it the old way with all"
"26019640","26024900"," right I appreciate showing up say thanks for thanks for dropping in and giving a lot of people"
"26024900","26030620"," inside this chat seem to be on the same page as us I mean I realize in public that we"
"26030620","26035900"," you want to defend Tesla and Elon and all that kind of stuff especially for your investments and"
"26035900","26040480"," your hopes and dreams for the company of Tesla but you know we want to have a real conversation"
"26040480","26048360"," behind that hype train that you know as push that narrative that we push on public but truth what"
"26048360","26058300"," the realities are right we can't let we can't let past performance with one one"
"26058300","26065620"," line of business influence how we think another line of business is going to be electric cars are"
"26065620","26074780"," not to gas cars as Tesla robots are to other robots it's a different industry with no incumbent"
"26074780","26081280"," players that are out there producing millions of robots that are everywhere already and they're"
"26081280","26086720"," gonna go in there and smoke them with new technology like it's it's not the same it's just not the"
"26086720","26096700"," same all right Joe thank you very much I'll talk to you soon probably and that was Joey"
"26096700","26100860"," donut from Twitter please fall but as a matter of fact out there if you're watching the show right"
"26100860","26110320"," now Joe donut his birthday is coming up and he's just a few followers away from I think being"
"26110320","26116980"," having the same number of followers as his birthday so if you don't follow him he's a great follow"
"26116980","26123760"," on Twitter look up Joe donut or you can also probably find him because I'm a friend with him and"
"26124260","26132520"," try to follow him he's a he's a very positive guy and is very pragmatic and is a lover of"
"26132520","26139320"," Tesla I'm a lover of Tesla he's a lover of Tesla and he's a very pragmatic Tesla bull so if"
"26139320","26144000"," you want to have honest open conversations where you're not concerned about what other people think"
"26144000","26149540"," or you know but the mantra maybe like I don't really like hearing some are not hearing but I can"
"26149540","26155880"," I can I can easily tell the pump talk and I can I easily tell the Q talk right the"
"26155880","26163940"," fraud fraud fraud fraud fraud or it's always roses 24 hours a day 30 streets five days a year so"
"26163940","26168540"," if you're looking for someone that people that actually own Teslas and people that actually invest"
"26168540","26176480"," in Tesla try to check out Joe donut on Twitter it's birthday dude follow him and say hello I will"
"26176480","26178020"," catch up with all of you "
