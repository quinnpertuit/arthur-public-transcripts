"25840","51640"," And oh,"
"51640","52740"," yeah, good morning, everybody."
"53820","54660"," How's everybody doing?"
"65720","66220"," Uh-oh."
"66540","68760"," When I'm missing my song, my, my mute, my jam's here. "
"72120","72460"," Upstate."
"73380","75400"," We're, we're running a little behind this morning."
"76080","76640"," Good morning, everybody. "
"76880","77640"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"77740","81180"," I'm gonna make this really fast this morning because I know the open is coming."
"82060","83300"," We have a lot to talk about today."
"86480","87660"," Now, we're gonna start right away. "
"88000","91120"," We're gonna get into the spot at Gameryport here in just a minute, but just for the open, we're"
"91120","95600"," gonna have a little talk here for you this morning."
"96600","100700"," So we're gonna turn, I'm gonna turn this off real quick and go straight to the live stream, cut"
"100700","101220"," this right off."
"102040","103380"," Good morning, if you're just joining us. "
"103700","106120"," It's a 9.23, we only have seven minutes left until the open."
"106520","107040"," I'm running a little bit late."
"107280","109500"," I might have to duck out this morning at some point as well. "
"110060","116760"," I have to go get a permit for some construction stuff, some remodeling stuff."
"117460","124760"," So we're gonna have a little talk about this stuff over here where we are this morning in the"
"124760","125020"," market."
"125020","126980"," Now we did break out. "
"127460","130120"," This is a huge move for the bulls over here."
"130780","135160"," They were able to break out from this descending channel, right?"
"135280","137100"," This negative channel that we're in."
"137460","139580"," This is a pretty big move that we have here. "
"140340","145180"," Now, there is some risk of selling off today down to this."
"145220","147020"," This is that same vault trigger we talked about, right?"
"147480","150700"," Down below here is negative gamma, right?"
"152020","154520"," And up here is positive gamma."
"155020","156960"," This is where volatility lessens. "
"157820","161000"," And we tend to make moves higher, right?"
"161220","164700"," Slow moves higher unless we have venom and charm on our side to make us move higher."
"165440","170840"," Now, another yesterday in spot cameras report they were talking, they gave two sides to what could"
"170840","171180"," happen."
"171380","178460"," One of the notes though, yes, but one of the notes about yesterday though, was that risk trade,"
"178620","183460"," that risk trade that you're set because we're so well hedged down here that you're selling puts"
"183460","187160"," down here and you're buying way outside the money calls. "
"187600","188800"," And those are printing."
"189100","191620"," We can see now that these are continuing to print."
"192360","195400"," That trade is continuing to pay off for these. "
"195780","197120"," These are high-frequency trading firms."
"197640","202680"," As a matter of fact, we saw some of that action as well, the previous day."
"203720","208760"," Really large, I think I posted about this on Twitter, there was 300,000 contracts on zero dates"
"208760","211820"," somewhere down in here, which is highly unusual. "
"212680","214580"," The same similar thing is happening here."
"214960","225260"," Now, last week I brought up a point that we could trade as high and test like 478, 472, something"
"225260","225900"," like that."
"226880","229160"," And this is much higher than even here. "
"229300","238820"," We're up to go back three months here and we're talking about retesting levels that are up here"
"238820","242440"," somewhere, which changes to white."
"244580","245800"," Make this thick."
"246180","251020"," Retesting these previous highs believe it or not, this is 471. "
"251500","255519"," 470, let's call it 472, maybe in this area here."
"256800","258959"," We'll start it right here."
"259140","261920"," Anything would be a freebie above 470. "
"262060","263560"," It's going to be a psychological kind of a thing."
"265280","268020"," But retesting these highs due to this move."
"268840","278560"," Also, and this is shocking because you're talking about a move that goes contrary to anything"
"278560","288520"," that we're looking towards for the FOMC come on the 4th and 5th, and then also OPEC's at end"
"288520","288860"," of May. "
"289500","290880"," We don't have a lot of time to get this done."
"291060","293080"," We have until end of month basically, right?"
"293180","296500"," We'd have until basically the first or around there to get this done."
"296620","299260"," And being the 20th, like, can we push this high?"
"299980","301200"," This is an R4 from the other day. "
"303520","304820"," We'll get rid of that R4."
"306360","308140"," That's that 456 number."
"308860","310480"," I think that's still in play like 454. "
"310840","312460"," We'll look at it today as we open this morning."
"313280","320360"," Now, but keep this in mind today, for this to happen, what you need to see happen is you would"
"320360","326910"," need to see a defense of this vol trigger down below."
"328710","331070"," We could be, we could gap up today, right?"
"331410","332510"," And bounce off 450. "
"332690","341410"," But as long as you see a defense of this 440, it opens up that 464-70 trade that we"
"341410","346150"," talked about last week when I was saying to you, it matters about the timing of buying those penny"
"346150","346710"," calls."
"347750","349150"," So, and there's a lot of room here, right?"
"349310","350330"," To get fucked up in this trade."
"351330","357550"," But if you do time it correctly, and if we're able to maintain down here, we could have a swift"
"357550","361550"," move higher to 470. "
"361870","371530"," Now, with that being said, if we do not defend this, this vol trigger here, we will make a swift"
"371530","375850"," move lower, which I'm sure you don't want to hear."
"376090","382270"," If this does not, if this volatility trigger does not hold, the support does not hold here."
"382610","385170"," We will make a swift move down to lower numbers. "
"386110","394410"," You'll see a retest of 435, and you will also probably see somewhere down here, 424 to 420, get"
"394410","394690"," tagged."
"395650","396570"," Now, so that's the key, right?"
"396670","399210"," If you're a bull, you have to defend this line now."
"400070","404730"," But if you maintain a defensive this line, believe it or not, we're not, we're not only going to go"
"404730","407260"," to 460, but we're going to go higher. "
"407740","410180"," We've already touched 460 once in the past."
"410960","412820"," We've already, we've already been up here, right?"
"413700","414840"," One, two times."
"415360","419580"," If we've rejected one, two, three, four times down below, and we're going higher, we're going to"
"419580","426900"," blast through 460, and we're going to head to 470, 480, and try to retest this higher number. "
"427480","432020"," So, I want you to be aware of that for where we are, and because we're breaking out of, currently"
"432020","434500"," breaking out of this, of this negative channel, right?"
"435020","440020"," We're swooping around here, I know that sounds insane and crazy to even say, but the possibility of"
"440020","442260"," us, and there's that retest down below here, 424."
"443940","448300"," We see that right down here here, and then I said 420, but let's call it 424."
"448980","451160"," So 435, we're down here in 424. "
"452100","454540"," Can we swiftly reverse course and head lower?"
"455040","455300"," Yes."
"455840","460640"," If we, if we run out of big players, big tech players, that is the one concern."
"460920","462300"," You see Facebook get knocked off. "
"462680","464180"," You see Netflix get knocked off."
"464280","469400"," At some point, it will become just stupid to be thinking that the index is going to be held up"
"469400","473280"," while we've got a, we've got all these big tech companies being knocked down."
"473400","478560"," If that does continue, that would force that trade lower from here. "
"478740","483680"," But with that being said, even with Netflix being knocked down yesterday, you can see that the spy"
"483680","484760"," is up this morning."
"485280","491620"," They're not going to let the index drop off until these companies can, can, can report."
"492380","493780"," We can see that at this point. "
"494480","499480"," What does that mean for you as a trader?"
"500100","504580"," It means that first, first of all, we're going to definitely try to retest that 450, right?"
"504720","508900"," Or where we're at right now, we'll bring up, we'll bring up book and book that real quick."
"511330","513890"," And you can see some resistance right away at 448."
"514270","515409"," You can see it here. "
"517650","520870"," Volatility where we are, all the way up to 450."
"522850","528350"," So I want you to see that right now right off the bell that there are some sellers here at"
"528350","528610"," 448."
"530650","535850"," They're not much above 449.50. You can't, you're not really seeing these, these sellers step in"
"535850","536190"," immediately. "
"536470","538170"," There's Summit 450 and 451."
"539570","543850"," Some sellers from traffic above here, not wanting you to get higher."
"546480","552040"," So my assumption would be we're going to, we're going to hit four, six or 450, reject and then try"
"552040","553340"," to make a move higher, right?"
"553480","560270"," We're going to try to gain some support and move higher to this 460 and possibly even, let's see"
"560270","561510"," where the big sellers are up here. "
"569130","571650"," 475 baby, right up there."
"573850","574210"," 475."
"575890","578690"," So what does that mean for you as a trader or even for me as a trader?"
"578930","579890"," I was thinking about it this morning. "
"580010","585090"," I woke up earlier this morning and the first thing that I thought to myself was I haven't yet put"
"585090","585830"," that trade on."
"586630","592230"," I was talking about it last week in Twitter, but then in stream, I said it's important to time it"
"592230","592530"," correctly."
"593210","598870"," You don't want to be buying like 470s a week ago and have them lose value for 480s and have"
"598870","602170"," them kind of go down and in shop, which they would have. "
"602570","611690"," But we are at that point in the market where you can take that trade for a swift move higher."
"611910","616670"," It would take somewhere between nine, ten days, somewhere around the end of the month for us to get"
"616670","616910"," there."
"617090","623050"," I was trying to count how many days, I counted between nine and 12 days to get there with a"
"623050","623910"," swift move up. "
"625110","630890"," I'm going to take a look at my my trade in here, one of them, I threw some trades on"
"630890","636020"," and I was looking through the options chain."
"636800","637920"," Hold on a second here."
"643470","647050"," I'm going to log back into my broker's here for him. "
"667400","668520"," I'm going to take a look."
"668660","674120"," So this morning I was taking a look through the options chain and I wasn't able to see where all"
"674120","680960"," the money was in the options chain heading out to the 29th, the 2nd, and another date passed there."
"681940","689260"," But I was looking for strikes in the 460s and 470s over the course of the next two weeks. "
"689400","698380"," Last time I traded this once with your wife's boyfriend, what we did was we loaded up on, I forget,"
"698560","703960"," I think it was down, don't try to remember where, let me look back and see real quick."
"706670","708190"," I think it was down in here somewhere."
"710230","714250"," It was, I think it was down in here, it could have been over here, but your wife's boyfriend and"
"714250","721790"," I at some point back in time, maybe it was three or six months ago, we bought like 100 point"
"721790","723910"," strikes and then 200 point strikes out. "
"724810","730350"," And I think we ended up selling, we made a bunch of money, but we ended up selling both times"
"730350","730770"," early."
"731210","736470"," We could have capitalized made like $100,000 or something, $200,000."
"736870","738290"," We took the money and ran at some point. "
"738690","740790"," Now the first set printed immediately."
"741150","746550"," The second set just kind of sat there and didn't print until we got the next 100 point, the next"
"746550","747330"," 100 point level."
"748930","753590"," So my point to you is this though, this morning is that well, first of all, why you guys to"
"753590","757610"," see where the, I don't know if I've shown you guys already, these are your levels for today before"
"757610","758390"," you get into spot gamma. "
"762030","763070"," We'll look at that right there."
"765370","766810"," Here are twos over here at 450."
"768170","771310"," Our one was right up here, we saw that 448 right off the bell, right?"
"772190","773310"," This band of resistance. "
"774710","780670"," And you've got this support zone down here, 445 and then 441 5.2. I think it's lower."
"780790","781750"," I think it's more like 440."
"782130","784310"," We'll take a look on spot gamma. "
"784670","785450"," Now this is the spot gamma."
"785470","788290"," We're gonna look on book map and see if it's actually at 440."
"789610","791130"," That's what I think it is, but we'll look. "
"794130","796110"," Let's see if we can see it down here."
"799950","805390"," 445.40. This is a big one here."
"805550","807250"," 442 is huge actually. "
"809310","809950"," And then 440."
"811630","816730"," So 442 is just got a nice it's 441 5.2. It's more like 442."
"821650","823690"," And then there's another one below it at 440. "
"824250","825010"," Big one at 440."
"827990","831870"," Now, and then we have a little resistance here and then we've got some resistance above 450."
"832210","837430"," Point that I'm trying to make to you is that we talked, I remember you remember we talked the past"
"837430","842330"," few days here where I say to you, if you're a bull, you're waiting for us to get above and"
"842330","846870"," out of this channel that this is risky in here in this volatility channel. "
"847370","852570"," Once you get above this zone here, we talked about this, I think yesterday we spoke specifically,"
"853150","859330"," once you get above and break out of this channel in this volatility zone, volatility tends to drop"
"859330","867990"," and we have a better opportunity to take longs here with less risk to those lungs printing."
"868810","873510"," Whereas in here, you can see the nastiness that takes place, right?"
"873650","878170"," You buy along in three days later and you're down another 30, 50 hundred points, right?"
"878650","888370"," You're below this line moves, but you can see you can't take a long down here at all with any"
"888370","889130"," kind of safety."
"889830","893830"," So the safety in lungs in here is non-existent, right?"
"894150","901230"," You can trade a day trade, but you can't take a long with any kind of confidence that it's going"
"901230","907230"," to go up over time over one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine days. "
"908830","911950"," What does that mean for you as a bull and a bear?"
"912590","918190"," If you're a bear, you want to see a break of this ball trigger."
"918310","921870"," If you don't see a break of this ball trigger, the bear game is over."
"921870","930470"," If you can't get a sell-off down below here and a rejection to lower numbers, right?"
"930810","932770"," The bear trade is over. "
"933030","937830"," The 666 Devil trade is not real."
"938010","938970"," It's not going to happen."
"939150","945970"," You're going to fail at this trade if this doesn't take place for you and volatility leaves the"
"945970","947070"," trade, believe it or not. "
"947770","950170"," So you want to see this as a bear."
"951270","957370"," We want to see a firm rejection come down and if you're a bear, you want to jump back into"
"957370","959970"," this trade only after it's confirmed."
"961210","966710"," I don't know that this trade is dangerous, but this trade here is not dangerous. "
"967490","969910"," This is the confirmation right here."
"970010","972590"," It could be two times, one, two, and then a shoot down."
"973010","975610"," But if you're a bearish, this is not your game right here. "
"975630","976550"," This is the bull game."
"977250","982950"," And the bull game is, before we are currently, is that you're looking to buy."
"985230","992610"," If you're looking to be buying any kind of a support area down here, if you're looking to be buying"
"992610","994350"," something like this, take higher. "
"995310","998350"," So this morning, we might trade higher now."
"998790","1003650"," A couple of bounces come back down to retest, one, two, and then boom, we're off and running again."
"1004290","1005970"," We have this option here. "
"1006310","1007170"," We trade higher to 450."
"1007750","1008470"," There's another option."
"1008670","1009730"," We come down, test, right?"
"1009970","1011010"," One, two, and then we shoot higher. "
"1011770","1017730"," But either way, if we get some rejection off this 450, the bulls, this would be, I think this is"
"1017730","1023470"," where that trade is to take to those higher numbers, 470, 480, somewhere up in there."
"1024790","1027450"," Now, what does that mean for you as a trader?"
"1028829","1030130"," What does that mean for you as a trader?"
"1030530","1031790"," I don't know what that means for you as a trader."
"1032530","1038010"," What I do know that it means for me is that I have to take a look at some far"
"1038010","1039270"," outside the money calls. "
"1041810","1047130"," For two brackets, I'm looking for, hold on a second here."
"1050400","1052020"," I'm going to get this all wrong here to land."
"1052580","1054020"," No, not that one. "
"1055260","1056180"," Is that better?"
"1056340","1056940"," No, not that one."
"1057940","1059040"," We'll just do it by the day."
"1062820","1069000"," What I'm looking for here is a trade, maybe three sets of trades, right?"
"1069220","1071860"," You buy three sets. "
"1072420","1078960"," You'd buy further out and you'd buy some, maybe some 450 calls, right?"
"1079680","1080180"," Short dated."
"1080980","1086160"," You'd buy some 460s that are really like four or five days away."
"1087640","1091320"," And then you maybe buy some like four"
"1091320","1102720"," or"
"1102720","1103900"," five to 12 days away. "
"1104180","1106100"," These will be like a penny, maybe three cents."
"1107580","1109700"," And these should be like 13 cents."
"1111040","1114120"," And these are probably like 40 cents or something right around there. "
"1114640","1115420"," Don't quote me on this."
"1115520","1118000"," This is off the top of my head somewhere in there."
"1119940","1121400"," And you'll run each set up. "
"1122280","1127160"," Now, you could, if in case there's some rejection here, you might lose some money on these trades,"
"1127380","1131000"," but they'll just keep printing as we continue higher."
"1131900","1133560"," I think that trade is available."
"1135960","1139380"," This bull regime could be more on than you think. "
"1140920","1149440"," So I'm going to look for today, I'm going to be looking for some cheap calls to 450 down here,"
"1150680","1157920"," some cheap calls to 460, and also some cheap calls to 470 like three cent calls."
"1158540","1165740"," This trade should only cost like a couple thousand dollars, but this trade could print a couple"
"1165740","1169340"," hundred thousand dollars, maybe more."
"1169820","1175100"," It depends if the interest kick kicks in in each one of these, the premium kicks in, it's like a"
"1175100","1178460"," hundred thousand dollars, it's like three thousand dollars trade for like a hundred thousand"
"1178460","1179080"," dollars trade. "
"1179860","1181460"," Maybe it's two hundred thousand dollars trade."
"1181560","1186920"," So it's dirt, it's a dirt cheap tail risk bull tail risk of us trading higher."
"1188560","1192420"," And this gives that this gives that confirmation that you're looking for. "
"1192900","1194060"," It should have done one tap."
"1194240","1198100"," It should be more like one, two, and then a then a trade higher."
"1200320","1205160"," And this it this it capture bears two bears to get all bears again, like me get all bears over"
"1205160","1205420"," here. "
"1205720","1206880"," I've already got some putts."
"1206960","1212260"," So if they print into Friday, I've got putts for today, and I've got putts for Friday as well"
"1212260","1213780"," expiry as protection."
"1214580","1219200"," So I'm going to leave those on into Friday, but at the same time, I think they're worthless now. "
"1219260","1220540"," I don't know what the fuck they're worth right now."
"1222200","1225180"," I've got a let me take a look and we'll see what we've got down here."
"1225640","1227620"," I've got a bunch of fucking 430s. "
"1227860","1229240"," I've got no 435s."
"1229280","1230240"," They have 430s still."
"1230500","1232020"," They're worth a penny now on Wednesday. "
"1232840","1234900"," And then I've got Friday."
"1235300","1236280"," I've got these are all free too."
"1236340","1239060"," I paid I paid for these and still made money yesterday. "
"1240180","1244160"," And I've got, yeah, 15 cents, 430s for Friday."
"1246020","1248480"," And that's that bear trade that we trade down from here."
"1248680","1254360"," Now with that said though, having already owned me, having already owned these, I am looking to buy"
"1254360","1255540"," somewhere down in here. "
"1256320","1257540"," Somewhere down this ball trigger."
"1257800","1263340"," If this ball trigger can hold right in here, this is this is this bull town."
"1263920","1265900"," You can't deny this for bulls. "
"1266600","1268080"," You want to deny it for bulls."
"1268240","1275500"," I can flip bull bear whenever whenever it deems be, but you can't deny that this this trigger right"
"1275500","1275920"," here, right?"
"1276060","1281560"," We are in a positive gamma environment regardless, regardless of what you want to say out there"
"1281560","1283720"," that this is positive gamma up here."
"1284200","1286580"," And this is the negative gamma down below. "
"1287200","1289180"," So down here, I've got my bull suit on."
"1289340","1291780"," And up here, I've got my bull suit on."
"1292380","1300180"," So if this holds today, I'll make a trade with you or we can trade this together for trade higher"
"1300180","1301560"," towards end of month. "
"1302900","1309780"," And that made thought processes that this is this is nothing that I'm in agreement with, by the"
"1309780","1309940"," way."
"1310520","1314960"," This is I have to try to think this is a tail risk trade."
"1316380","1320500"," And I'll just put these in the back, I'll put these in the back, I'll put these in the back"
"1320500","1322360"," closet and just watch them. "
"1322820","1326800"," Last time we did something like this, if they printed fucking huge."
"1327860","1331880"," So we'll pay attention to this trade to this morning."
"1332860","1335060"," We'll go over the we'll go over the spot gamma report. "
"1335340","1337700"," I'm going to take a few moments here, just a couple moments."
"1337700","1342860"," I'm going to run through some of the options chain and I'll still be here."
"1342860","1343940"," You'll see me on screen and stuff. "
"1344040","1345140"," I'm going to take just two, three minutes."
"1345540","1350960"," I'm going to take a look at those three options, those three options in there and see if there's"
"1350960","1352500"," anything of any interest."
"1352500","1357160"," If anybody's purchased any of those already and see if there's something that we're not seeing. "
"1357360","1361100"," If there's a bank or something that already knows has already done this trade, we just don't know"
"1361100","1361520"," about it."
"1362240","1363280"," So I'll take a peek here."
"1363700","1364480"," Give me like two, three minutes. "
"1364660","1366860"," Then I'm going to we'll go over the spot gamma report next."
"1367500","1372680"," I'm going to leave up the book map for you so you can see if there's a place for a"
"1372680","1373460"," bounce down here."
"1375260","1377800"," So you can see if there's going to be some support. "
"1379020","1380560"," Give me just a couple minutes."
"1381620","1386120"," See if we can find some looks like there's some money down here popping in."
"1386220","1395150"," You can see it at 444.50. And then again down at that 440 down below here. "
"1396690","1399350"," So we'll see if we'll see if the buyers step in down here."
"1399430","1401970"," You can see them right down here."
"1401970","1402750"," You can see them. "
"1403310","1409970"," 444.50. I'm just going to take a look at this chain now that the market's open."
"1410730","1411610"," Good morning, by the way."
"1411690","1412810"," How's everybody doing out there this morning?"
"1418070","1419750"," I'll bring your comments in just a minute. "
"1419870","1420530"," Can we just two minutes?"
"1420710","1421510"," Let me just take a look at this option."
"1421590","1421950"," Okay."
"1559160","1559560"," All right. "
"1559720","1560500"," So I'm taking a look here."
"1561500","1562260"," I think it's right here."
"1631530","1631930"," Okay. "
"1632790","1634770"," So I'll see it here."
"1635210","1635870"," See what's going on."
"1636290","1636810"," Let me pay attention. "
"1644950","1646250"," Let's take a look down below."
"1647570","1660250"," It's more like putting it down below here at 4.4286. There's"
"1660250","1660890"," some more showing up."
"1661090","1662030"," 4.42 flat. "
"1664170","1672150"," And then 4.4280. A little bit of rug pulling going on back here."
"1681500","1691670"," A little bit"
"1691670","1700450"," of rug pulling on at this 4.4450. 1, 2, 3, 4 bands down below here."
"1703350","1709090"," So I'm looking at 4, 8 per 22, 450 C's a moment ago. "
"1709250","1712930"," They were 97 cents of assuming they're going to as we trade down."
"1713110","1717270"," 4.25 for Monday expiry, 450 C's."
"1717430","1719290"," They were $1.51 a few minutes ago. "
"1720130","1721330"," These prices are going to change."
"1722310","1725470"," 4.29 though, 4.29, 460 C's."
"1725810","1727030"," Those are only 38 cents. "
"1739970","1742190"," May 2nd, these are 20 cents."
"1743190","1752910"," So the the easy trade is probably May 4th, 4.70 for 11 cents for May"
"1752910","1754930"," 9th, 4.70 for 20 cents."
"1755730","1759110"," But there are there are two other really cheap ones. "
"1759410","1762330"," 4.29, 4.70 for 3 cents."
"1762550","1763490"," Those could go down to a penny."
"1764390","1766630"," That's the original post was about penny trades. "
"1766810","1770790"," You buy them for a penny and they go up to like 50, 60 cents or something."
"1771990","1776050"," And then on May 2nd, there's a 4.70 C for 5 cents."
"1777730","1784650"," Now the weird part about the 1 penny and 5 penny trades, those won't kick in until you hit 460"
"1784650","1786850"," and higher than 460. "
"1788110","1792350"," You won't actually see money in that trade until you get above 460."
"1793670","1802810"," But for the farther out trades, I'm going to probably put 502,000 bucks down on maybe like 4.29"
"1802810","1804950"," for 3 cents."
"1805730","1810330"," We'll take a look at what that pay would be on that trade. "
"1811130","1811910"," Give me a second here."
"1813690","1815130"," Let's spread this out a little bit."
"1821110","1823150"," A little bit of rug pulling going on down here. "
"1829110","1831150"," And I'll bring this up somewhere else."
"1831710","1836410"," Let me just a second here."
"1836490","1840290"," I'm going to bring it up on options, profit calculator and show you what I'm talking about. "
"1854750","1857210"," So spies at 4.46. I don't care about the price right now."
"1857290","1857910"," I care about a bounce."
"1858430","1864370"," And then looking for two options for 450 or three, 450, 460s and 470s. "
"1864490","1872350"," Now the one that I'm thinking about here is May 2nd, right?"
"1875050","1877070"," I'm looking for the 470s."
"1877690","1878790"," Now this doesn't account."
"1879030","1882210"," This calculator is account for a whole bunch. "
"1882410","1883630"," These are now 7 cents."
"1883970","1886510"," They were 5 cents a moment to go."
"1886630","1888110"," So they're getting some option premium. "
"1889410","1892210"," I want to put a buy in for like 3 cents though."
"1893630","1896090"," And I want to buy like 300 of these contracts."
"1898090","1899170"," 900 bucks. "
"1899990","1902950"," I agree to the terms and calculate."
"1905910","1909850"," This trade will pay like $77,000 or so."
"1914000","1914800"," $42,000. "
"1914860","1915860"," I was going to get closer a little bit less."
"1916120","1917720"," $20,000 for $1,000."
"1918020","1919060"," So what is that?"
"1919160","1921180"," 2,000 percent trade. "
"1921700","1923960"," Now it shows you're going to make a ton of money back over here."
"1924480","1925540"," Like 12,000 or something."
"1925600","1929440"," I don't believe this calculator because I've noticed it takes time. "
"1929740","1931400"," Like you won't see actually see this kick in."
"1931500","1936720"," They'll still stay like three to five cents on the spy until interest and premium kicks."
"1936780","1939660"," And you won't see that premium kick technically today. "
"1939660","1948960"," As a matter of fact, this trade right now was, look at that, $429, 470c."
"1949400","1951300"," I've got it at 3 cents here, not 2 cents."
"1953740","1955000"," April 29, or is that April?"
"1955180","1956480"," No, that's April 29th. "
"1956500","1958300"," I've got it at 3 cents on my end, 2 cents."
"1960160","1967860"," So I might throw a $1,000 trade at a $1,000 trade down here on this trade."
"1967860","1970820"," And we're coming into that level of support here, right?"
"1971560","1977640"," We're coming down to bounce right now, right off that larger channel that we have. "
"1978000","1979660"," The vault figure is down below here."
"1979800","1982140"," We know S2 is down at 442."
"1985240","1987900"," So I'm going to place a trade coming in here. "
"1988580","1989460"," I don't care if it burns."
"1989700","1999530"," I'm going to hold"
"1999530","2002290"," before I place these trades when I, well, I'm going to see what you guys are."
"2002690","2004290"," I'm going to see what you guys are here talking about. "
"2004990","2007590"," And see what you guys must start with the chat up here."
"2008130","2008870"," Good morning, everybody."
"2012190","2016350"," Yeah, I don't, I don't, these, these trades aren't trades where I'm like, yeah, they're going to"
"2016350","2016530"," print. "
"2016830","2021730"," These are trades where this is kind of like buying 400 putback spreads"
"2021730","2031510"," or 360 good"
"2031510","2031790"," time."
"2032490","2034470"," Good time changed my mind as well, Tom."
"2035610","2037130"," Good time was an amazing movie. "
"2037890","2040410"," We're in a sea of shit movies going out there right now."
"2040690","2042710"," I still haven't watched Batman, but it's on my list now."
"2042770","2045030"," It's like, I've got the one show, Severance. "
"2045570","2047610"," And now I'm going to watch Batman and something else."
"2050110","2051510"," Yeah, 470 Wowsers."
"2051650","2052310"," Yeah, hold on. "
"2055790","2057710"," Whatever happened to Spock Emory's existence."
"2057850","2059429"," We're going to go over Spock Em and just a minute chase."
"2060350","2061810"," Apple earnings on the 28th. "
"2061830","2064690"," So yeah, Apple earnings won't be good supply chains issues."
"2065190","2066770"," A lot of sped, fed speakers today."
"2066969","2068690"," Yep, we do have a lot of fed speakers today. "
"2070870","2074130"," Curious what Spock Emory says morning, morning Zach, how are you?"
"2075250","2077409"," Marcus, we're going to pull that back right."
"2079790","2082350"," How the hell did this Ponzi manage to open green today?"
"2083210","2084590"," It's a it's fucking bizarre."
"2086350","2092570"," Yeah, this week, Spock Emory has claimed by a bag holder Bobby that because we're so overly hedged"
"2092570","2094530"," that they're not going to print any of that shit. "
"2094810","2096690"," That's the basic that's like the basic take."
"2097710","2104650"," As per you gamble out trading view, we're just under gammon version of four seventies for five to"
"2104650","2107110"," Brad through some of those fucking shit trades on there too."
"2107710","2108150"," Yeah. "
"2109230","2111230"," Well, yeah, I'll put trade the news on for you right now."
"2111410","2111950"," Thanks for saying something."
"2112070","2113430"," I always forget to put that shit on. "
"2114010","2116990"," Thanks for whoever who said that this morning."
"2117130","2117990"," Don't forget trade the news."
"2118510","2119230"," Sure trade. "
"2119430","2119830"," Yeah, brother."

"2134250","2135250"," Thanks morning, folks."
"2135790","2136370"," Praying for puts."
"2137650","2138270"," Come on. "
"2138310","2139290"," He has died for me."
"2140230","2141830"," Praying another reversal today."
"2141830","2143010"," Good morning, Paul. "
"2143590","2143870"," How are you?"
"2144630","2145970"," Paul, how are you, too?"
"2146390","2147370"," Thanks for that vault trigger."
"2147510","2149370"," Quick blind profiles of Valley in the minute chart."
"2150850","2152170"," Two minutes to the top of the air. "
"2152330","2156430"," We'll get exactly what's needed for March in the U.S. Inspector 5.7 this morning."
"2156590","2157670"," Good morning, everybody."
"2157670","2160690"," Again, about 4.1% from six months here or two million prior. "
"2161570","2162430"," Good morning, everybody."
"2162710","2163570"," How are you all doing this morning?"
"2164270","2166050"," Heading right back down to that vault trigger this morning."
"2166350","2168350"," Now, this is the EES line. "
"2168450","2170650"," I do want to do one of the key guys into something."
"2171150","2172290"," Let me make this more clear."
"2173510","2175530"," I'm telling you what I think it is. "
"2176110","2178750"," This is the E-mini trigger."
"2183900","2190320"," Now, the E-mini trigger is 443.89, I think."
"2191600","2200930"," The trigger for the trigger for"
"2200930","2205350"," SPY is 443 flat. "
"2207130","2217540"," But there was such a disparity on that trigger that SPY"
"2217540","2217720"," trigger."
"2219280","2221640"," There was such a disparity in it, such a large."
"2228080","2230800"," You'd think I'd smoke marijuana or something, have a cough like that. "
"2230900","2231580"," I don't even smoke cigarettes."
"2233520","2238960"," But this wasn't enough to the existing home sales expected at 5.7 million."
"2243260","2248840"," This is the actually the SPY trigger down below for getting your bare seat on. "
"2249660","2251620"," But there's such a difference here."
"2254620","2256480"," Then I want to count for the entire move."
"2256700","2261920"," The entire 10-point move or 10 handles or I don't know what you guys call things. "
"2262320","2265960"," But you want to count for this whole area in here."
"2265960","2269420"," Or maybe track both between EES and SPY."
"2269700","2273320"," Get the March existing home sales data for the U.S. in just a few seconds. "
"2275020","2275980"," Hold on here."
"2291500","2296960"," 5.77 million in line of expectations."

"2396000","2397240"," Next stop below is 440."
"2398440","2399200"," We'll take a look and see."
"2399880","2401300"," Some down there, 442. "
"2402140","2404580"," Then 440 would be next stop if we continue lower."
"2407400","2409220"," So right in here."
"2410160","2412100"," You can see this little bit of liquidity here. "
"2412340","2413840"," And then this little tiny bit right here."
"2430790","2433890"," We'll take a look at those 425.450s and see what they cost."
"2443020","2453000"," They were $1.51. We first started selling off and now down to $1.35. $1.33."
"2453400","2455660"," There's 3,000 contracts bought on them right now. "
"2461680","2463180"," We'll look for the following date."

"2470600","2473820"," On the 29th there's 33,000 contracts on 455. "
"2476480","2479240"," Not much on 460 on the 29th."
"2485630","2492390"," There's 703 contracts on 460s at 49 cents for May 2nd."
"2500560","2504140"," And actually 470s for May 2nd have now gone up. "
"2504360","2505920"," So they're still at 5 cents."
"2506580","2510000"," It's right at 5 cents for May 2nd for 470 C's."
"2519390","2521870"," So we can break down here and get down to this 440. "

"2524990","2526330"," 4, 4, 3, 6, 9."
"2527250","2528150"," And then again at 443."
"2530810","2532730"," We can catch up bounce somewhere down. "
"2532830","2536150"," I'm going to try to grab some of these where we are right now."
"2536950","2539750"," Between here and 4, 4, 2, 5."
"2540490","2542090"," And then if we trade down to 440."
"2543470","2544770"," This is what it looks like the real money is that. "
"2545350","2551130"," If we trade down to 440 today, I'll grab some of the whole bunch of stuff with you."
"2551170","2552010"," I'll let you know when I buy them."
"2556390","2560050"," So where we are right now currently, we're going to see if we catch this bounce. "
"2560890","2563670"," I'll go over the spot gamma report with you currently where we are."
"2564250","2566170"," You know where this line is right here."
"2566470","2575230"," You know over the past month that we traded outside yesterday and are now beginning to trade down"
"2575230","2580030"," into the volatility into into the into the vault figure down here. "
"2580190","2582430"," We want to see if this holds and clear this up."
"2583970","2584830"," See if this holds."
"2584970","2585730"," We can make our way higher. "
"2587230","2591270"," Or if we trade below if you are bearish, if you're not already in if you're not already holding old"
"2591270","2595050"," put to whatever, you want to be if you want to pick up a new bearish position, you want to"
"2595050","2600130"," wait for confirmation to take a trade to much how much lower numbers for."
"2600130","2607450"," I think it was 435 for the first test than 424 for the second price target."
"2614930","2616190"," Okay, so spot gamma. "
"2616750","2618850"," Now this is the report for today, April 20th."
"2619450","2623950"," Futures have popped up to yesterday's high of 446-0 ahead of this morning's expiration of"
"2623950","2624090"," expiration."
"2624910","2630210"," We continue to look for high volatility within an SG implied move of 1.12% open to close. "
"2630710","2635850"," Resistance is at 4500 with support at 445 and then 445."
"2637290","2639650"," The spy equivalent is 440."
"2641170","2642110"," So we have 445. "
"2642210","2644710"," This is support here right where we are."
"2645530","2646750"," Let me clear this out."
"2647870","2649230"," We've got some support right here. "
"2650050","2652710"," And then they're claiming that we have support down below at 440."
"2653490","2656690"," And we're kind of seeing that right where we are today."
"2657230","2663410"," If you were to look at the spot gamma right where we are right here, we seem to have some"
"2663410","2663670"," liquidity. "
"2664350","2666030"," We've got some buyers stepping in currently."
"2668420","2669480"," I'm going to bring this closer."
"2673120","2676260"," Right in here, you can see it right in this zone right here. "
"2679080","2681900"," See if we can see that right there, a little block right here."
"2682140","2683420"," This is a block of buyers."
"2684740","2690000"," And if this block of buyers is not able to absorb, then we'll move down to the 440 area down"
"2690000","2690300"," below. "
"2695330","2696310"," One second here."
"2700370","2701510"," Just a second here."
"2701610","2702190"," What am I looking at?"
"2709530","2714070"," We know that there will be a very sharp drop in spy gamma readings this morning, driven primarily"
"2714070","2716330"," by yesterday's price action higher. "
"2716930","2720150"," Down one to two percent from current levels, i.e. spy 440."
"2721030","2722390"," We see primarily put gamma."
"2722870","2727390"," Whereas near current prices, 445 on spy, call interest increases. "
"2728490","2731890"," We drove the reduction in negative gamma, which drove the reduction in negative gamma."
"2732390","2734670"," Less negative gamma implies less market volatility."
"2735710","2740630"," And yesterday's AM analysis we presented the chart below noting light options positions above,"
"2741450","2748250"," greater than or equal to 445.50. Because of the light options position, we felt dealers would not"
"2748250","2749470"," need to buy on a rally. "
"2750170","2753750"," The caveat to this was if implied volatility was destroyed."
"2754330","2755510"," So VIX expiration, right?"
"2755910","2757370"," Which is what took place yesterday."
"2757910","2763110"," If implied volatility is crushed, dealers need to buy futures, i.e. the vanatrade. "
"2763690","2770350"," In the last 24 hours, the VIX declined 3.8 points with VIX expiration seemingly the only catalyst."
"2772290","2774450"," This is the chart from yesterday, right?"
"2775130","2780890"," And if we didn't have VIX crushed yesterday, we should trade down to lower numbers, right?"
"2781510","2786210"," They'll end up, the dealers are shorting futures, which we haven't seen."
"2787570","2791710"," Shown here is activity for the 420 expiration in the VIX. "
"2792430","2798690"," You can see that most of the at-the-money interest is in VIX puts, top chart red bars."
"2798990","2804910"," With 21 puts being particularly active yesterday, bottom red bars, note how below 20 open interest"
"2804910","2812090"," drops significantly, suggesting there is little from a positioning standpoint to push VIX below 20."
"2812770","2814290"," VIX hedging or other flows. "
"2815110","2823470"," VIX currently is at, we just pinned at 20.03. So you'd want to be looking for continued the put"
"2823470","2824110"," buying, right?"
"2824270","2828930"," Or at least VIX or UVXY put buying currently where we're at at 20."
"2829790","2832930"," To a similar point, yesterday's flow is the spy QQQ."
"2833110","2836970"," And is the spy QQ was concentrated in very short dated options. "
"2837650","2843070"," Spy 445 calls were particularly active and are now a prominent feature of the gamma distribution"
"2843070","2844850"," noted below or below."
"2845230","2851010"," Note the light gray shaded area, which indicates a lot of current at-the-money gamma will disappear"
"2851010","2854770"," with today's OPEX."
"2855290","2861170"," In fact, nearly 20% of SAP Gamma expires today, which is a bit odd for a midweek OPEX. "
"2861730","2867250"," So I'm assuming that this is the, well, I think what they're implying by this is that rather than"
"2867250","2873030"," grabbing last Friday's OPEX, you're grabbing the following week's OPEX, to not get caught in not"
"2873030","2874290"," printing those puts."
"2874930","2879490"," This interesting aberration seems to sync with the crushing of implied volatility, i.e. the VIX."
"2880370","2881710"," So I may have that wrong. "
"2881970","2884050"," I guess we're assuming this is 445 Cs."
"2885190","2889330"," The next strike of prominence though, once we expire today, is 450."
"2889710","2894250"," This would then become 450 would then become the next most prominent call option. "
"2895770","2900090"," The point here is that we've yesterday's rally is driven by VIX OPEX positioning."
"2900550","2907070"," Regardless, the VIX at 20 suggests traders are looking for a 1.2% daily S&P moves, which is"
"2907070","2912550"," just slightly above our S&P implied move of 1.2%. In other words, the options of implied volatility"
"2912550","2916150"," has now reached a fair value point based purely on price action."
"2916730","2922490"," One could argue that implied volatility or VIX should hold something of a premium due to the"
"2922490","2924250"," current fiscal monetary geopolitical risk. "
"2924710","2926190"," I think Chase was asking about this the other day."
"2928290","2933710"," Someone in chat was asking, why are we not going down below 20, even though the market is moving"
"2933710","2933990"," higher?"
"2934790","2936570"," This is what the point they're trying to make."
"2936950","2943870"," This premium on the VIX just for OPEX and for FOMC. "
"2944570","2950370"," Further, as per the SV500 chart shown at the top, the market still exists in a void of sorts,"
"2950950","2953470"," particularly with large spy OPEXs today."
"2954070","2955750"," OPEX removes the FOM many positions."
"2956470","2962090"," We see 4,500 call walls significant overhead resistance and also feel that a drop back into this"
"2962090","2964790"," void to 4,400 can happen quickly. "
"2966570","2969790"," We're looking to see if we catch this bounce here."
"2970590","2972610"," Do we actually catch this bounce right here?"
"2973810","2980370"," Or if people want to monetize these calls that they're buying, they'll hold on to them to end of"
"2980370","2980490"," day."
"2980550","2985150"," If they don't hold on to them into end of day, just a second here. "
"2992410","2998050"," If they don't hold on to these calls here, we would slip right if they decide to monetize their"
"2998050","2999430"," calls and not replacing them."
"2999830","3003830"," We'll wind up slipping down into that 440 area."
"3004570","3010590"," You'd look for rebying of call options to that 450 strike. "
"3017330","3021950"," In simpler terms of view, yesterday's rally is technically driven by very short term flow."
"3022610","3025570"," Mean reversion back into 440 is quite possible."
"3025810","3032090"," We give edge to that scenario as VIX expires and today's S&P OPEX removes positions. "
"3032770","3039830"," That break over 4,500 would render this view invalid as dealer hedging flow becomes supportive of"
"3039830","3040610"," market prices."
"3042170","3046270"," When I'm taking away from this report this morning, I'm going to scroll through this so you can"
"3046270","3060930"," pause this morning's video so you can get your numbers, your"
"3060930","3061950"," support at 20."
"3062850","3070970"," The point they're trying to make is if you see VIX puts monetary monetize, if you see no further"
"3070970","3076010"," call buying that at any point you could see it move lower. "
"3076770","3081630"," We revert back down to this 440 and then you'd be looking for renewed call buying."
"3082370","3088050"," What that doesn't take into account is if the market says, nope, I'm not waiting for 440."
"3088370","3089310"," I'm going to buy calls here. "
"3090150","3092610"," We'll see if the market steps in right now."
"3092970","3094470"," It starts to buy further calls."
"3094470","3095890"," They're not willing to wait for 440. "
"3096490","3099690"," If they just want to rocket ship this up into 450."
"3100930","3102990"," There's two trades here, right?"
"3116700","3118320"," There's two trades here today."
"3118580","3123980"," There's the one trade that we're going to trade higher to 450 immediately off this morning off of"
"3123980","3125640"," support level one at 445. "
"3126100","3132880"," Then there's the second choice which would be maybe we only trade to maybe here let's say then we"
"3132880","3134700"," revert back down to 440."
"3135700","3165240"," Then you renew calls to take the 450 and clear"
"3165240","3165740"," that out."
"3166600","3171300"," In 45 minutes or so into the trading session, the NASDAQ remains down more than 100 points while"
"3171300","3175100"," the S&P is up to and the DAO was up more than 200 help by proctor and gamble. "
"3177060","3178200"," Bring this back here."

"3259620","3263340"," We've got three, I think three fed speakers all day long today. "
"3264680","3266500"," I think we're heading for that vaults figure quick."
"3267180","3268200"," Yeah, I agree with that."
"3268360","3269360"," We're heading to the vaults figure. "
"3269560","3270180"," We test the lows."
"3271380","3274580"," If going along like that, 470 seems post them, three would be better."
"3274760","3276160"," All these puts were all off the pumps. "
"3276500","3278680"," Going up on 10-year, near 3 percent."

"3281860","3283440"," Paramount gets hammered down 8 percent. "
"3283640","3285520"," Might be a good entry before I call as we talk about."
"3285740","3288520"," Yeah, Chase, I was looking at Paramount's yesterday."
"3289920","3296560"," When Disney went down, I saw that Paramount trade yesterday as two and I didn't put anything on it. "
"3298590","3300310"," It's down this morning too, right?"
"3300550","3300810"," 3197."
"3303090","3304470"," I'm going to take a look at it real quick."
"3305050","3305910"," I did notice it yesterday. "
"3309510","3310350"," I love this trade."
"3313250","3321050"," So the Paramount trade has printed huge multiple times in the past."
"3321290","3321850"," We got one there. "
"3322050","3322750"," We got one there."
"3322970","3323750"," We got one there."
"3324870","3326430"," It's selling off again. "
"3328490","3338330"," My one concern with the Paramount trade is the poison pill that Netflix"
"3338330","3339110"," is currently."
"3339430","3351620"," Someone made a comment on Twitter yesterday saying we're"
"3351620","3361380"," talking about the age of too many streaming companies out there and that that"
"3361380","3366580"," view is going to poison the entire streaming market."
"3367880","3373700"," But they also noted that you have you noticed that Facebook hasn't come back since it's deep sell"
"3373700","3374000"," off. "
"3374260","3377280"," So you may want to hold before getting into Netflix."
"3377540","3381080"," There could be people afraid of the initial jumping."
"3381320","3390280"," I think you've got sell shock and snap in a bunch of other fucking speculative growth tech stocks. "
"3390960","3391480"," Same thing, right?"
"3391620","3394640"," If you bought them too early, unless you hold them for a week or a month."
"3396920","3397320"," Only."
"3397320","3403340"," But the poison pill has been dropped on Netflix might be a cause for concern. "
"3403760","3406580"," Now, this trade that's gone, I think this is December, right?"
"3406800","3409480"," This trade that we did, I think I did this once or twice."
"3409480","3412340"," But I think I think Joe Donut might have done it even more."
"3413940","3417700"," This is a trade not based on Paramount doing anything special. "
"3417960","3419260"," They actually have some good shows that right now."
"3419260","3419600"," I'm surprised."
"3420620","3421580"," But they have a really good book. "
"3422300","3429060"," But this trade is more geared towards this trade is more geared towards a buyout of some kind."
"3429880","3432100"," All these these companies have it around for ages."
"3432440","3439740"," They have properties that if like a company like Netflix would die to have, they would kill to have"
"3439740","3443900"," established properties that they could reinvent and add to their book, right?"
"3445080","3453920"," And so there was someone, someone back in September or November, they were asked, there was some"
"3453920","3459460"," big big time traders are asked if you if you had something that came out of left failed in 2022,"
"3459460","3460220"," what would it be?"
"3460780","3467860"," And they mentioned the consolidation of companies like Paramount that you'd see Paramount, this"
"3467860","3470480"," Paramount R&B bought by like Netflix or on Amazon. "
"3472520","3474840"," So I'm down for this trade chase."
"3475760","3477920"," But I don't think that I like it here at 32."
"3478240","3487640"," I think if we went as low as 2725, I'm betting because of the poison pill that Netflix just shit"
"3487640","3491120"," on the entire market that we could go lower. "
"3491360","3492620"," We've already been lower at 10 bucks."
"3494800","3502280"," So I'm going to look for a new buy down here at like 2150 or 20 bucks, believe it or"
"3502280","3502480"," not."
"3503620","3509300"," I think I can go that low just on the poison that Netflix Netflix provided. "
"3511080","3519320"," But I still think this is a kick ass trade for for for takeover or for I'm emerging of some"
"3519320","3522580"," kind at some point because I think that's what they need to do to survive."
"3522820","3528220"," I honestly think that like Disney for like Disney to survive or Amazon prime to survive or for"
"3528220","3528700"," Netflix."
"3528700","3530720"," We talked about we've been talking about this since December, right?"
"3530860","3538420"," We knew that for these companies to survive, they have to have that reason for you to want to rent"
"3538420","3538840"," them, right?"
"3539260","3544200"," That's where someone else started on HBO Max, how cheap it is and that you just know you're always"
"3544200","3545140"," getting quality programming. "
"3545560","3550880"," You don't know that when like even myself, what we do is we sign up for like Hulu, then we"
"3550880","3552840"," dump it, then we get Netflix, then we dump it."
"3553060","3559820"," We have Amazon year round, but then my kids will get like Disney plus for like a month and they'll"
"3559820","3563240"," watch everything that comes out that had come out for the last couple months on Disney plus."
"3563860","3566840"," And my wife will, you know, they use it as encouragement, right?"
"3567020","3570780"," Like like a like a treat your kid good kind of a thing. "
"3571280","3572820"," Like which one do you want this month?"
"3572920","3573860"," You did a good job in school."
"3574440","3577420"," And so they'll rent whatever service that they're looking forward to watching."
"3579160","3582700"," So you'll probably watch some consolidation in some of these companies. "
"3584400","3593610"," So how about a new price target on what a new price target on Paramount of like"
"3595940","3602240"," somewhere down in here, maybe even steeper could be even 15 bucks."
"3603160","3604880"," Yeah, but we should watch that trade."
"3605720","3607560"," If there's a if there's a turnaround on Paramount. "
"3610710","3611350"," Doing great."
"3611510","3612230"," How are you doing?"
"3614030","3615490"," Good morning."
"3615950","3619550"," Cap looks like the bulls sticking it to my short. "
"3620130","3622670"," Yeah, I've got a I've got some zero dates."
"3622810","3624230"," We're getting fucked up this morning."
"3625270","3626930"," The gap up into sell moves. "
"3626950","3627450"," Good morning."
"3627590","3628590"," Any Netflix calls yet?"
"3628890","3630370"," Uh, I haven't looked for Netflix calls."
"3630370","3631330"," I'll look though right now. "
"3632550","3635030"," I'm not I'm not touching Netflix with a 10-foot pull."
"3635330","3636590"," I don't care how high it goes."
"3637110","3637930"," I'm not touching it. "
"3638410","3645570"," And then some of their, um, we've got some Netflix calls here that we got 10 orders of $1.5"
"3645570","3647090"," million in calls."
"3647370","3648790"," I've got them up on Discord right now."
"3648790","3655650"," If you want to see see the bounce back trade for Netflix, I'm not touching with a 10-foot pull"
"3655650","3655810"," though. "
"3655950","3656690"," I don't want anything to do with it."
"3657430","3662210"," I thought there I thought their press releases yesterday were bad or bad juju."
"3662590","3664030"," I wasn't down with it. "
"3664390","3670050"," I don't like the idea or then someone else made a comment on Twitter yesterday about this that"
"3670050","3675270"," they've been investigating on how to stop people from using their service across multiple"
"3675270","3675710"," platforms."
"3676090","3679370"," Everything I use like I can't have a second instance of book map open somewhere."
"3680030","3683790"," I can't have a second instance of trade the news open somewhere else. "
"3683990","3689370"," I can't have a second instance of anything that I use open anywhere."
"3689710","3691310"," So I don't quite understand."
"3692030","3698210"," I don't quite understand the, um, the context of I"
"3698210","3706610"," don't quite understand the doing. "
"3706810","3713370"," It shouldn't be too difficult to just sell screens like you buy one screen a month, two screens a"
"3713370","3718770"," month, three screens a month, four screens a month, uh, one instance of each that you use."
"3718770","3722930"," It's not complicated and you don't have to get shitty about it."
"3722990","3724290"," Doesn't matter where they're using them. "
"3724630","3728990"," You just price that into your into your models and you're good to go."
"3729470","3731670"," Uh, I understand that there's people that pass them around."
"3731810","3735890"," I get that there's like, if there's only one screen, one instance of a screen you're running, but"
"3735890","3736470"," I'm using it. "
"3736550","3740690"," Then my kid's using it at college, and then my brother's using it up the road to watch the movie."
"3740870","3744810"," I get, I get that, but I'm assuming that you can build that into into your models."
"3747780","3752140"," The way they're going about it there at their PR about it is, is kind of fucking wonky. "
"3753400","3755420"," Uh, it's, it's poison to me."
"3758260","3758800"," All right."
"3758900","3759180"," Next one. "
"3759640","3760600"," Uh, shirt trade."
"3760760","3761700"," Good to see a couple of days ago."
"3761920","3763920"," We were looking at a debit put spreads. "
"3764420","3765860"," Um, yeah."
"3766140","3771940"," So the debit put spreads, uh, the debit put spreads we were looking at a couple of days ago."
"3773240","3774020"," Let me see. "
"3774780","3781320"," A second here."
"3784060","3784860"," Take a look."
"3801670","3804170"," The put spreads that we were talking about are back here, right?"
"3804490","3805390"," This is what we're talking about them. "
"3811070","3820060"," And we talked about these that put spreads down to down here to four third."
"3820240","3820620"," I think it was fourth."
"3820840","3822660"," Do we say 430 was the low on these, right?"
"3823120","3824740"," 440 to 430. "
"3824880","3827460"," I think we're talking about on these we have faded higher."
"3827700","3833920"," I think they're dated out to four, uh, four may, um, for middle of may."
"3834080","3835600"," Do you are you still holding up those four four?"
"3835720","3836080"," Who is that?"
"3836260","3836520"," Zach Burton?"
"3836900","3839920"," Are you still holding those, uh, those put spreads, but Zach or no?"
"3840620","3842040"," And what dates do you have them on?"
"3846910","3847970"," Are you still holding that?"
"3848110","3849190"," What, what strikes did you get?"
"3849350","3850430"," And what dates did you get on them?"
"3855410","3858050"," Very bear buyers waiting in Netflix for an oversold balance. "
"3858050","3859330"," We'll get Netflix right now."
"3859570","3861070"," Zach, let me know what you bought what you're holding."
"3869560","3876760"," And when did when did you buy them to?"
"3876940","3877920"," I guess we the next question. "
"3879800","3885180"," Did you buy them at the top of 443 440 or did you end up buying them lower at like,"
"3885180","3887080"," did you buy them at 435 for 430?"
"3917350","3923650"," Checkbook map looks like a lot of liquidity has disappeared coming into support."
"3923650","3924210"," It would be great."
"3924950","3928550"," You know, double those 445s from like 57 cents. "
"3928750","3930130"," Hey, thank you."
"3930130","3930450"," Good morning."
"3931270","3934150"," She is getting mastered and at Netflix is free falling. "
"3934450","3935630"," I haven't looked at Netflix yet."
"3938370","3940170"," I haven't even looked at it on a chart."
"3940530","3941650"," Holy fucking shit. "
"3944590","3945390"," Jesus Christ."
"3946030","3948050"," I haven't even looked at Netflix yet on a chart."
"3950070","3953730"," I'm like spias about about fucking poison pill on Netflix. "
"3953930","3955170"," I had no idea it was it was burning."
"3957270","3957830"," Look at that."
"3958810","3960830"," These are the two blue lines that we had, right?"
"3961670","3963690"," Uh, we had this is what we had. "
"3966090","3967490"," We blew right through 250."
"3967810","3968130"," We didn't blow."
"3968270","3970450"," We hit 255 almost to the fucking T."
"3971210","3975390"," Uh, if you guys look at that, we tagged it. "
"3975950","3977290"," We fucking tagged it."
"3977790","3979330"," We had this on here for like a week or two."
"3979370","3981850"," We fucking tagged it and then fucking thing rolled right off. "
"3982690","3986810"," Uh, I'm not a fan of Netflix right now."
"3986870","3988290"," They did a piss poor job."
"3989750","3994690"," If you guys, if yesterday I went through all the news releases that they wrote, they released"
"3994690","3995110"," yesterday. "
"3995270","3999470"," 90 seconds of legally delete the totally mandatory data crude expected plus two million barrels,"
"3999730","4005210"," gasoline and distillity expected minus one million utilization expected of six tenths of 90.6"
"4005210","4007790"," percent under an yesterday's API data."
"4008030","4013610"," We saw a drawn crude of minus 4.5 million barrels built in gasoline plus 2.9 million and this"
"4013610","4015230"," was a minus 1.7 million."
"4016450","4018070"," I might get a nice bounce here. "
"4018370","4019790"," I think you oil people out there."
"4021270","4022850"," I might catch a nice bounce here."
"4024330","4025970"," Always gets weak right before the report. "
"4027970","4030390"," Now Netflix, dude, I don't know what to say."
"4030730","4032230"," I mean, you can buy Netflix down here."
"4034010","4036690"," You like, there's got to be smarter people in the room. "
"4037790","4038450"," I understand."
"4039010","4046930"," So there was one other cut thing to say would be for a quarter or two for a quarter or"
"4046930","4047250"," two."
"4048110","4050970"," See that nice little buy down below here on the spy. "
"4055110","4064970"," For one or two quarters on Apple, people couldn't wrap our analysts and now analysts understood"
"4064970","4070150"," it, but the general public didn't understand it and the and the reporters couldn't understand how"
"4070150","4070350"," to."
"4070350","4071910"," We've deleted in just a few seconds."
"4076610","4079950"," Didn't know how to sell Apple selling services. "
"4081530","4084970"," So people were saying, well, Apple's not a growth company more than I put out new products."
"4085490","4090030"," They're just, you know, rehashing phones and computers and stuff like that."
"4090170","4090610"," We want a car. "
"4090830","4096069"," Crude of minus 8 million barrels minus 8 million barrels for crude, gasoline minus 0.8 million"
"4096069","4096430"," barrels."
"4096810","4100710"," Dislip minus 2.7 million barrels of drawn all three categories."
"4102109","4105170"," Pertilization up 1 percentage point and 91 percent. "
"4105609","4111590"," Cushing crude inventories dropping 0.2 million barrels to 26.2 million total."
"4112029","4113810"," Does that bounce those down about?"
"4113950","4118470"," Total plastic production rises by 100,000 barrels to 11.9 million barrels."
"4121740","4128920"," Golden ticket on CCJ 916, September 16th, 28th, 1.3 million dollars. "
"4129260","4131420"," Look at that ripper on USO."
"4132220","4136540"," Crew features rising on the surprise large draw in crude stocks."
"4137859","4138800"," Here comes the rip. "
"4138960","4139840"," Here comes the face ripper."
"4141760","4143180"," We'll watch this one for a minute."
"4143979","4145000"," Just blasting off. "
"4149010","4152850"," So Apple had transitioned to selling services."
"4153870","4155189"," They used to trade Apple all the time, right?"
"4155630","4157210"," Apple was like, well, we're not going to make new shit."
"4157630","4163609"," We're just going to fucking dig our hands into our customers and take more money from them than"
"4163609","4163890"," before. "
"4164149","4168290"," We're going to charge them for this and charge them for that and charge them for this in services."
"4169370","4175850"," But once that kicked in over the course of a quarter or two, they realized how much growth they had"
"4175850","4177930"," from selling services."
"4179310","4187069"," The way that Netflix dealt with this bad quarter, it was almost like there was a big boardroom"
"4187069","4189910"," fight and people were pissed off each other. "
"4190930","4192810"," And then they got a shitty PR team."
"4193350","4198810"," And you can't tell me there aren't five smart people in that room that know how to increase profits"
"4198810","4207170"," or to grow profits, either by buying out other companies or either by saying, oh, yeah, we extended"
"4207170","4212850"," our reach to, you know, we've captured all this market in India, China, Russia, or whatever."
"4213690","4217630"," And at the same time, they've basically slapped their American audience, right?"
"4217830","4220530"," Their core audience, they've slapped in the face. "
"4221610","4224490"," And so you've got this like double whammy, right?"
"4224650","4229970"," You've got this where they're not able to monetize their foreign content."
"4231330","4237050"," They're not appeasing their home-based content crowd here."
"4237150","4240710"," And so you've got, you know, you've got pitchforks and fire out. "
"4240710","4246310"," And then you've got the whole other thing going on with the woke movement that pisses off a whole"
"4246310","4249070"," nother group of people in the United States."
"4249070","4252930"," So you've got all the, you got pissed off people ever, or you got pissed off, but you've got no"
"4252930","4260710"," money coming in from overseas or no ability to lock that money down, right?"
"4260890","4261590"," Lock that money in."
"4262370","4266210"," And then you're investing overseas, not in programming for the United. "
"4266410","4267930"," You're just pissing everybody off at this point."
"4269830","4272250"," So, so what are my thoughts on Netflix?"
"4272850","4273850"," You can't trust me."
"4273930","4275890"," It looks like it's catching a bid right now down here at 212. "
"4276030","4277770"," But how long lived is it?"
"4279070","4285990"," And even if it does catch this bounce, do you think it's going back to 700 today?"
"4286290","4287090"," Probably not."
"4288790","4290770"," Maybe make it trade sideways, right?"
"4290950","4291990"," We all know what happened to Snap."
"4293610","4294870"," We all know what happened with Twitter. "
"4296750","4298410"," We can see what happened with Twitter, right?"
"4298530","4299070"," And just look at this."
"4299250","4301690"," This is death and destruction, right?"
"4301870","4304310"," This really is death and destruction on Snap."
"4304570","4306090"," But what if you catch a bounce down here?"
"4306090","4311030"," You can trade this maybe for a day or here for a day or here for a day, like a"
"4311030","4315310"," week or so or a month with the full knowing that it's going down?"
"4316290","4317350"," So what's easier?"
"4317530","4319550"," Just selling tops, right?"
"4319830","4320850"," Or is it buying dips?"
"4321130","4323090"," I don't know, whatever your trading style is. "
"4323370","4326670"," But Netflix is in a world of fucking hurt right now."
"4327570","4328210"," They are."
"4328450","4329350"," They're in world of fucking hurt. "
"4330830","4337910"," And even going back, I'm pissed off for the people that work for that are vested, maybe part of the"
"4337910","4339710"," package is getting Netflix shares."
"4343470","4345910"," You know, Netflix is back here at 200 bucks, right?"
"4347110","4350170"," In 2017, they spent a lot of time down here at 100 bucks."
"4352850","4358610"," You know, you can't have this from what's considered to be, you know, one of the best companies,"
"4358950","4363350"," one of not one of the best, but you know, one of the biggest growth company potentials in the"
"4363350","4363550"," country. "
"4363550","4365450"," I mean, these people could do anything."
"4365450","4367690"," They could start their own social media company."
"4368170","4370570"," They could launch a competitor to YouTube. "
"4372170","4378770"," They could be, you know, fitting the fire for smaller content, smaller content creators."
"4379030","4384690"," You know, this is all kinds of ways for them to tap into new money streams."
"4385330","4388090"," And they just sound like fucking a bunch of kids. "
"4388450","4390910"," Really, they sound like they sound like Blockbuster, right?"
"4390910","4393490"," They sound like we don't have any answers."
"4393750","4395270"," You know, we're taking the easy way."
"4395630","4397550"," Almost like they're fat off of it. "
"4397570","4402430"," They've gotten fat off of this market domination, and they need to reinvent themselves."
"4402770","4403910"," They need to offer something new, right?"
"4404850","4407150"," They need to be like Netflix in every flight."
"4407390","4408690"," They need to be Netflix in every car. "
"4409970","4412190"," There needs to be services, right?"
"4412470","4413570"," Like Apple has come up with."
"4413930","4418450"," And you certainly don't want to hear, we don't know what the fuck we're doing in their guidance."
"4419230","4423750"," So I'm not a fan of Netflix currently. "
"4426430","4429070"," USO had that good, beautiful bid down here."
"4429850","4432270"," Gorgeous buy a buy down below on USO."
"4435250","4437330"," Spy catching a bid off the belt. "
"4437610","4439210"," There's one concern that I would have in here."
"4439390","4445830"," Today would be that this is only, this rip will only be used to monetize."
"4446210","4447510"," You get monetize books. "
"4447510","4449350"," That's Evan saying monetize."
"4449350","4450850"," But monetize books, right?"
"4450950","4453630"," The next year in place is going to be at 2%."
"4453630","4456090"," It puts on Vix, right?"
"4456210","4457990"," And then eventually you get that rollover down to 440. "
"4458550","4459310"," And then you look for that."
"4459690","4460730"," The real move to 450."
"4460730","4462570"," You hear from Evans yesterday as well. "
"4469330","4470870"," Evans is a dove, of course."

"4473470","4475510"," Inflation will be at 2% in 2023. "
"4476210","4477230"," That's pretty fucking bullish."
"4477490","4479290"," Or Dovish to be saying."
"4479910","4485770"," But I don't know if he's making that contextually saying that inflation will be high, much higher"
"4485770","4486530"," in 2023. "
"4486690","4487850"," But I doubt the word down at 2%."
"4487850","4489210"," Comment from a Polish central banker."
"4489590","4493530"," Litwinik saying that the Polish central bank may be nearing the end of rate hikes. "
"4496130","4498150"," I expected housing permits that yesterday."
"4498610","4500670"," Even R.C. is showing green shoots."
"4501130","4501750"," Cues look horrible. "
"4502490","4502970"," Please take 435."

"4509270","4509830"," Jesus Christ."
"4511050","4512990"," You'd be up huge right now, if he's shorted."
"4513950","4521790"," Even that, even that fucking, let's see if there's any sellers that are hiding up here. "
"4522130","4525370"," That fucking, yeah, they're still sitting there."
"4525490","4532090"," They're up at 447.71. It's a little bit of sellers here at 447 as well."
"4532330","4533770"," So just be careful as you get to 447. "
"4534730","4539730"," And 447.69. If you're long here."
"4545180","4546420"," It was bizarre."
"4546640","4551960"," So I was looking at the, I think we called out to a strangle, right?"
"4552120","4554220"," We called out a put spread strangle. "
"4554640","4556380"," That shit would have been fucking money."
"4557220","4559040"," I should have put that trade on and I didn't."
"4561190","4566890"," It was like a call spread and a put spread strangle. "
"4567070","4568410"," They were way the fuck outside of the money."
"4568590","4571690"," They were like stupid, like 100 points in each direction."
"4572910","4577470"," Both were dirt fucking sheep and printed like fucking 2000% each. "
"4578450","4580110"," You would have made stupid money."
"4582230","4583490"," There we go, right up there."
"4583950","4586410"," 447.71 is a price target on the spy. "
"4588170","4589290"," If we can get there."
"4596940","4599460"," Please let us know if and when they trade."
"4599640","4600800"," There's no vanatrade right now. "
"4601800","4606560"," The vanatrade, they're testing the vanatrade to, uh, Vickspiration."
"4610350","4615610"," Evans goes on to say that's a good reason to think special factors causing high inflation will stop"
"4615610","4616390"," going up."
"4617150","4617870"," Yeah, question. "
"4618090","4621430"," I saw that, um, I saw that, uh, the inflation on Germany."
"4622230","4625370"," I wonder if they calculate it honestly too, whereas we don't."
"4626270","4629450"," I did see that, uh, that German finance minister lender. "
"4630390","4631430"," Was it was a lender that said that?"
"4631850","4632850"," Was Nagel that said that?"
"4637970","4640370"," Uh, ECV's Nagel says he's a hawk."
"4640370","4643390"," Uh, ECV could raise rates early in Q3."
"4643790","4645110"," Stagulation and scenario must be avoided. "
"4645570","4646790"," Economic outlook is subject to high uncertainty."
"4648270","4649810"," I have a global growth forecast."
"4650190","4650950"," We forgot further. "
"4651670","4653650"," I am against nasty rate hikes."
"4654050","4655990"," Russia, gas, and bark reduce double-digit inflation."
"4656630","4656770"," Fuck. "
"4660170","4661830"," Germany's getting pretty fucking bearish."
"4670350","4671190"," What here?"
"4672390","4674010"," I've seen something else earlier."
"4688600","4692160"," Let's see if, um, let's see if we still have these sellers above here. "
"4702280","4703400"," Fixed less than 20."
"4703660","4703920"," Get ready."
"4704680","4704940"," Let's see. "
"4706180","4708920"," No open calls on Netflix, like the death of it."
"4709560","4710560"," Totally enabled captions."
"4711320","4714880"," I don't know if you can get captions unless they're auto-generated or on a live stream. "
"4715140","4716200"," There has to be recorded, I think."
"4717000","4717920"," I'm not positive on that."
"4721690","4722810"," Yeah, no, no way. "
"4722990","4725250"," Uh, honestly, we reported a record hike."
"4725430","4728950"," Never liked that without an insane interior mo- an insane interior motive."
"4730690","4731610"," What's it, two, ten?"
"4732090","4732630"," Hey, everyone. "
"4733010","4733070"," Hi."
"4735310","4736010"," Hi, Floyd's garage."
"4736290","4736470"," How are you?"
"4738150","4739290"," Career crack and TV show. "
"4739470","4740810"," That's worth 576, right?"
"4741670","4742550"," I haven't watched that show yet."
"4742690","4743170"," I've got it."
"4743330","4743970"," I want to see it though. "
"4750690","4752250"," All the fizz, sense of our zoops."
"4753070","4754530"," So should I buy Netflix now?"
"4756930","4759290"," That was Disco's TV reporting."
"4763050","4765550"," I'm buying Netflix in the 100s and 2024. "
"4766230","4767170"," That's fucking hilarious."
"4768070","4771090"," Trading higher now, looking for that 447."
"4772370","4775210"," Target is 44770 on the spy. "
"4779820","4782880"," And we also have another target above of 44961."
"4785250","4787430"," Looks like the 450s have come down."
"4787890","4792590"," Rather still here at 449, a little bit lower today at 44955. "
"4796870","4797830"," Ooh, yeah, baby."
"4804470","4812690"," Coming back to retest the drop from this morning, where the drop is starting to retest that again."
"4813250","4814750"," We'll see if this holds up or not. "
"4819810","4825030"," Have not seen any movement in the April, let me see if there's April's 470s are up at all."
"4825550","4826910"," The May 470s."
"4831140","4835040"," Yeah, that's 6.20%. May seconds. "
"4852950","4870450"," Uh, Tesla,"
"4870790","4871690"," you'll look at Netflix too."
"4872810","4873730"," Look at Netflix."
"4880620","4882380"," Seems like big support down here. "
"4885580","4887640"," Here, indicators fucking terrible."
"4897520","4900580"," What's next stop if we break if we break 200?"
"4901240","4902420"," Seems like a reasonable place."
"4902420","4906240"," I mean, 200 for a major stop. "
"4906920","4909160"," Now we got 190, 180, 175."
"4910780","4911700"," Free fall to 150."
"4915980","4918680"," Light support at 130, 135ish. "
"4919920","4920980"," And then 100."
"4921460","4924640"," That's a fast mover, if there ever was one."
"4924640","4925560"," Down to 100. "
"4925560","4926700"," There isn't much stopping it."
"4928400","4932540"," There's not much stopping it down to 100, believe it or not."
"4933180","4935140"," There's a lot of space down in here. "
"4937480","4939360"," So any kind of rug pull up here, 200."
"4943790","4945310"," Any kind of rug pull up here."
"4947110","4952330"," Now, if you're bearish and you want to take another short, if you see another break below 200. "
"4954430","4956830"," That's the next short, I guess, on Netflix."
"4962910","4965210"," Canadian dollar and you're the highs of the day now."
"4966230","4971250"," $124.85 and dollar CAD down 136 pips on the day following that CPI print. "
"4989530","4993690"," We'll load up the past couple hours on Tesla."
"5001090","5002570"," Let this load up per minute here."
"5008830","5016570"," Resistance is still there at 447.74. You'll see those sellers right in here. "
"5017270","5037480"," They'll slightly lower 447.65. Keep"
"5037480","5038320"," an eye on these sellers."
"5045070","5047050"," Yeah, I haven't looked at a TLT this morning."
"5047290","5048370"," I looked at it early this morning. "
"5048370","5049210"," It was up a dollar."
"5050010","5051430"," Oh, I like this trade, man."
"5054120","5055260"," I like this trade a lot. "
"5060030","5062530"," Man, it looks so good like a reversal here, doesn't it?"
"5064150","5065010"," The bond trade."
"5066230","5070690"," If you do take a long bond trade, you have to hold them for some time."
"5072110","5077110"," Anywhere, I mean, if you take a trade, it's got to be one to three months out and you've got"
"5077110","5077650"," to hold them. "
"5077750","5087550"," And try to keep them in the money and also try to find strikes with interest already on"
"5087550","5087790"," them."
"5087950","5096930"," Do not ever trade a TLT without being on same strikes as other people and with time on them, one"
"5096930","5097810"," to three months minimum."
"5098070","5102510"," If not six months to a year trade and try to find interest. "
"5103080","5112390"," If you don't find interest, look for even like zeros or fives on strikes"
"5112390","5114530"," in areas of interest."
"5115310","5125170"," So an example would be you'd get like a 130 strike for"
"5125170","5127810"," one, three, six or months or a year out."
"5129010","5135670"," Or a city timing for monetary policy can be sensible in dealing with inflation. "
"5136190","5141010"," Take 140s, 130s, even 120s that are a year out."
"5141190","5142730"," They're nice, like right in the money."
"5143710","5146190"," You do 120s and you get them for a year out. "
"5146990","5148810"," But be careful when you trade TLT, you have traded it."
"5149890","5153530"," It's like watching paint dry sometimes, getting a print."
"5154470","5160030"," It can take fucking weeks, even if you're in the money, even if you're up, even if you're up, the"
"5160030","5169490"," spread or the white spread asking bid is so big sometimes that if you're not on a popular strike,"
"5170190","5173290"," you're going to get the fill from what the market makers are offering. "
"5173530","5175510"," And that's always a pretty pretty fill."
"5176730","5179270"," They kind of hold your hostage to get a print."
"5180390","5188030"," I do enjoy sometimes spreads on TLT more so or leaps than just like hand buying calls in the money. "
"5194500","5196520"," Yeah, I got Tesla coming up for you here in just a minute."
"5202620","5204400"," Nice trading range for Tesla, right?"
"5204680","5205200"," Five down here."
"5205300","5206860"," We talked about 990, I think the other day. "
"5207660","5209160"," There's the tag on 990."
"5209400","5212380"," We talked about, they take profit at 1030."
"5212980","5222820"," We'd like to see 1050 before, before we get to, before we get to earning the earnings"
"5222820","5223160"," report. "
"5225100","5229380"," Now let me know what you guys think about in the earnings report for today for Tesla."
"5230100","5232640"," I am a little apprehensive on the earnings report in Tesla."
"5233360","5233920"," I'm not going to lie. "
"5240470","5247130"," I think that Netflix, I think that Netflix certainly is going to impact it or perception of it"
"5247130","5247510"," impacting."
"5249030","5254050"," I wonder if there's a pretty decent, I wonder if there's a pretty decent chance of a sell off into"
"5254050","5257630"," the bell and then because of the, because of the Netflix fear."
"5258830","5261190"," And then maybe like another grab for a long. "
"5263530","5264850"," I know most of the reasons."
"5265410","5270430"," So the Menosco's honest say that it has increased steel prices for car makers by 50 to 60 percent"
"5270430","5271970"," beginning April 1st."
"5274820","5276500"," Look at my chart for Tesla to have. "
"5279150","5282050"," Man, it did so, it's so set up for a fall."
"5286690","5293390"," Yeah, it's set up for like a, I'm not saying this is going to happen, but it's, it's set up"
"5293390","5301940"," for like, it's set up for like an okay, like an okay earnings report, right?"
"5302120","5308140"," But I sell the news and while all the bears are talking craziness, it just fucking gets bought"
"5308140","5308640"," right up."
"5309020","5310320"," Boom, right?"
"5310640","5311940"," Something stupid like that. "
"5313900","5321780"," You know, I'm not saying this is what's going to happen, but I've been in Ears where I'm like, I"
"5321780","5324980"," used to throw my, what I used to trade Tesla roll of time."
"5325580","5326280"," I didn't care."
"5326460","5330200"," I'd just buy calls because I've made so much money in the run ups and the rest of the year"
"5330700","5333580"," that I would just, I would just throw money to the Tesla gods. "
"5336520","5343100"," And I always feel like you get like specifically this, where I get this nice little sell down over"
"5343100","5348100"," here, sell down into earnings report, it should go up."
"5348320","5351000"," I mean, I think that's the thought is that it should go up right then and there."
"5351300","5354660"," And then they fake you out, right?"
"5354800","5359680"," All the interest goes away for Tesla, or even if it does go up, the interest goes away for Tesla. "
"5360180","5370100"," And then it's like one to five, one to five strikes out or dates or days out,"
"5370100","5372700"," just trading days, you just, it fucking rockets."
"5373980","5376340"," And you met, you end up missing in the trade."
"5379050","5380570"," That's my take on Tesla, I think. "
"5380990","5385250"," If I had to guess for Tesla today, Tesla will go up."
"5386210","5387930"," There's going to be some panic selling into the clothes."
"5389630","5393310"," I think that the ER report's going to be neutral. "
"5398810","5400330"," And I think it's going to go down."
"5401270","5403970"," But then I think it's going to get bought right the fuck back just like that."
"5404090","5404890"," That's why I think it's going to happen. "
"5406470","5409350"," This is a shot in the dark guess on playing."
"5409390","5412030"," I've been saying the Fed will reach neutral by the end of the year."
"5412870","5418690"," This is a shot in the dark based upon my experience playing Tesla, playing Tesla earnings. "
"5419810","5427410"," I'd have a price target of 10, 20 by end of day for clothes right here."
"5428910","5429690"," Somewhere in here."
"5431290","5433070"," We're at 10, 0, 6."
"5433510","5435490"," So we're at 10, 0, 6."
"5435730","5438170"," Give it to 10, 20, possibly 10, 30 in the bell. "
"5439290","5441190"," If there's no panic selling into the bell."
"5443670","5448010"," From all the negative, like everybody knows, everybody knows that this is supposed to be a negative"
"5448010","5448250"," ER."
"5451330","5454510"," It wouldn't shock me if the ER is neutral. "
"5455150","5458930"," And then all of a sudden we get a news report like one to three days."
"5460910","5464830"," Plus we've got, we also have a split coming up too."
"5465970","5470810"," So that is what I'm looking more forward to towards is the split. "
"5471710","5474930"," I think there's a couple of companies out there that are looking forward to their splits, like a"
"5474930","5475690"," run up to their splits."
"5476650","5479630"," I think that you have that news."
"5481910","5484730"," And I think that banks want to in cheaper that run too. "
"5484970","5487070"," I would say that banks want in cheaper that."
"5487070","5491230"," The only other thing you have to think about here is if we had a Netflix type of event, how"
"5491230","5492030"," deep can it go?"
"5493810","5495030"," We should talk about that."
"5495170","5498010"," I didn't want to talk about it on Twitter last night because I don't get yelled at by people. "
"5499430","5503070"," Evan saying that we are talking about relatively continuous hikes."
"5506810","5508230"," But let's talk about that."
"5508630","5510150"," And I don't think Tesla will ever do this. "
"5510410","5515470"," But I mean, in terms of, I think that Tesla's impact is complete."
"5515530","5517750"," It's not the same story you can't compare Netflix with Tesla."
"5519730","5526010"," But shit, I mean, just here in February of 2022, we were down to $700. "
"5528570","5530030"," This was ugly down here."
"5530210","5530890"," I traded this."
"5531090","5532050"," This was fucking ugly. "
"5534610","5538250"," The corrective movement was basically here."
"5541100","5541680"," And that was it."
"5543340","5544320"," That was the move. "
"5547680","5549700"," You know, this accumulation phase, right?"
"5550000","5553260"," We came up from 700, banged it out almost double."
"5554300","5556620"," So what you always have to think about is where the banks did."
"5556880","5561200"," Evan saying that the Fed will likely end up with a restrictive stance. "
"5563390","5565330"," You've always seen where the banks are in."
"5565610","5566790"," Like where did the banks buy?"
"5566970","5568110"," And the banks bought down here."
"5568290","5569410"," This is where the banks bought down here. "
"5571470","5575310"," And so, and they've brought down the lower, but they're basically in here."
"5575310","5580470"," So you have to think about that if there was a steep sell off in Tesla that it can easily"
"5580470","5582890"," go to 700 bucks easily."
"5583110","5584070"," It can go lower. "
"5584670","5587750"," If it was ever, I don't think it would ever, you'd ever have the ship show that Netflix has."
"5588050","5593930"," He'll take Elon whenever I'll allow that in one of his pressers, where there's like something"
"5593930","5597650"," that's not already planned by banks, right?"
"5597990","5598670"," Something that's unexpected."
"5599110","5601230"," Like Boston Bearworks did that stupid shit. "
"5602350","5605590"," Or, you know, that same stupid ship, a stupid shit like that."
"5606670","5608990"," So, but I would be prepared for that."
"5609370","5617490"," Just know that if you're long into this ER that if it was a really negative ER, 700 is on"
"5617490","5619550"," the table at all times. "
"5622730","5625930"," And they can use bad ERs and excuse."
"5627170","5631430"," For it's not the reason, it's just they want to take profit and they want to be low."
"5631630","5633070"," They want to be in sheep for the split. "
"5633990","5635170"," That would be the back room."
"5635270","5637590"," That's what the old fat white guys would say in the back room, right?"
"5638330","5642750"," I'm going to trigger a sell and I'm going to get in as cheap as I fucking possibly can."
"5643350","5649290"," And then I'm going to run my own camp, my own advertising campaign into the summer time to force"
"5649290","5653770"," all these hedge funds and banks to buy my bags and crank the price up again. "
"5654610","5658590"," Just being honest with yourself about this kind of stuff because this kind of stuff happens."
"5662350","5665070"," Especially on, you know, people say that can't happen."
"5665410","5666990"," Tesla's worked so much because of this other thing. "
"5667250","5667650"," It is."
"5667830","5669970"," It's a $30,000 stock."
"5670370","5673030"," But from here to there, they're going to make a shit ton of money. "
"5674870","5681430"," Just be conscious of this that 700 bucks is not, you know, this was back in February, right?"
"5682110","5683470"," This year is just two months ago."
"5685130","5686510"," It wasn't that long ago."
"5686590","5687890"," This wasn't actually the trade I'm talking about. "
"5687890","5690050"," This was the trade that I made way back here."
"5690050","5690990"," I'm getting my time wrong."
"5694230","5695670"," We had another one back here. "
"5697390","5698770"," You can see it right here, right?"
"5701090","5704050"," This is the other one, the other corrective move right here."
"5704770","5705130"," Here's one."
"5706470","5707910"," Here's the other one over here. "
"5708970","5709750"," Draw another one."
"5714710","5717310"," You have the dates wrong, but you can see how consistent it is."
"5723810","5730990"," This is the second one here, right at back up to $1,200. "
"5731150","5736990"," He's been saying that he feels pretty confident and trend growth rates will be on the low side."
"5737850","5739270"," You know, they just did it again."
"5740430","5741650"," So are they going to do it again?"
"5741990","5743170"," Like, do they do this shit again?"
"5747050","5748130"," You know, that's a scary part. "
"5748270","5749270"," Maybe it's on a smaller scale."
"5751290","5752450"," Hammer something down like this."
"5753030","5754510"," And this is in June and July. "
"5754610","5755330"," You can see it, right?"
"5756530","5760510"," I'm not saying it's going to happen, but, you know, this is how shit happens."
"5760870","5762130"," This is fucking banks, man."
"5765270","5768750"," You get this blast down here that all of a sudden you're cranking back up again. "
"5770470","5772910"," Fucking savages for fucking savages there."
"5776820","5779500"," So just be conscious of this 700 number down here."
"5779520","5783100"," If it's a bad year or it's easy for them to, hey, I'm going to sell it in my position"
"5783480","5784680"," and run it back up again. "
"5785940","5787000"," As be careful of this."
"5789380","5791460"," Do you short ER?"
"5792200","5793680"," I don't know what the answer is to you."
"5796400","5801420"," This looks like panic to me based on Netflix. "
"5801660","5807700"," I think it's a little bit of an old reaction, but I'll put a price target at 10.20 and"
"5807700","5808640"," 10.30 would be the high."
"5810920","5812420"," If we can get up there into the bell."
"5813140","5816880"," If it's just panic all day long or sideways over the close, I don't say to you. "
"5816940","5822700"," What I'd say to you is if you want to trade Tesla, wait until after ER, then take a long"
"5822700","5823720"," or a short after ER."
"5824840","5827100"," Let some of the interest cool off on it."
"5827800","5829600"," If you're a Tesla bull, that's what I always recommend. "
"5830400","5831380"," Unless you want to throw your money away."
"5832360","5834660"," I've thrown my money away on these trades on these ER trades."
"5834660","5841620"," I've made shit tons of money on them too, but you lose seven out of the three trades. "
"5842160","5847140"," Or set out of seven out of 10 ER trades on Tesla, you lose seven of them."
"5848580","5851460"," It's just be aware of that as you move forward."
"5856280","5857880"," I always prefer the trade after. "
"5862840","5864400"," So above here, we've got that resistance."
"5864400","5868560"," And still have the resistance over here at 4, 4, 7, 5."
"5870590","5872630"," The sellers are still kind of bouncing around here."
"5873970","5875870"," We'll look higher and see if we can still get higher. "
"5876330","5878230"," More stars above here at 4, 4, 9, 5, 8."
"5880950","5881950"," You can see them up in here."
"5882750","5885030"," And some more here at 4, 4, 7, 7, 6."
"5887150","5888990"," And 4, 4, 5, 0."
"5901170","5902930"," Might be a nice short trade down here."
"5904490","5908410"," It's at 4.40. And you might still get that little pop above, right?"
"5908530","5913290"," You get that little swing high real quick that traps the bears, but then we come back down and"
"5913290","5913930"," touch it again. "
"5917190","5924570"," It's supposed to go get a permit this morning."
"5924930","5926590"," It's fucking already 11 o'clock and I haven't gone."
"5927490","5928970"," My wife hates me sometimes. "
"5931030","5932990"," Yeah, I'm not saying the ER is not going to be."
"5932990","5939550"," I'm not, you know, I've made a lot of money, Tesla, 429, 1050C for $1.3 million."
"5940150","5941930"," I'm not saying the Tesla's not going to beat. "
"5943010","5944370"," I'm not saying it with conviction."
"5945970","5953750"," I look at it purely from a, I stopped, I stopped paying, like I see, I read and understand the,"
"5955590","5960150"," I used to get on the rabbit hole in Tesla and I lost a lot of money doing that."
"5960890","5966790"," So now I look at it from the bank's perspective because they're the ones that actually move at all"
"5966790","5967070"," stocks. "
"5968510","5970690"," And they'll pull the plug whenever the fuck they feel like it."
"5970830","5973490"," You should take it as a warning looking at Netflix."
"5974090","5978190"," You can make any excuse up if you want in the world for why Netflix is down. "
"5978690","5980130"," Well, we discussed it this morning, right?"
"5980930","5984870"," But the key part for you to know, the key part that you need to always understand as an investor,"
"5985150","5991850"," as a trader, especially like an employee of Netflix is that no matter what they tell you, no matter"
"5991850","5995930"," what people tell you, no matter what reasons you have for why a stock should go up and go down"
"5995930","5999850"," at any moment, a bank can pull support from that stock."
"6001330","6005870"," And they can do it to Tesla at any time for any reason, and they can just make shit up"
"6005870","6006310"," for it."
"6007790","6017530"," And I'll tell you what, you, I'll tell you what, that might be a lot for"
"6017530","6017810"," you. "
"6018810","6025150"," But as an investor, or as a long time holder, or as a long time trader, or someone that depends"
"6025150","6028090"," upon that money, that fucking hurt."
"6028370","6031330"," Like that Netflix shit hurt some people out there."
"6031890","6037990"," And so if you're a long Tesla, and you're a Tesla bull, like through and through, and you're out in"
"6037990","6043190"," social media telling people, you know, like, Tesla's going to have a great ER or Tesla's going to"
"6043190","6049550"," have a, or not a bad ER, but like a great 8, great ER or there are times to buy"
"6049550","6049770"," Tesla. "
"6050310","6055170"," And if you want to be like a great bull, a great Tesla bull, like you want to, you want"
"6055170","6062230"," to be like, if you want to be like a trusted Tesla bull, you know, I've got problems with some"
"6062230","6070130"," Tesla bulls because some Tesla bulls have different, different goals, right?"
"6070130","6074390"," If you've got a thousand bucks in your trade and Tesla, your goals for Tesla are different than my"
"6074390","6077230"," goals having 10 million dollars in Tesla."
"6078250","6081530"," So if I've got 10 million in Tesla stock, right?"
"6081790","6083430"," I'm always going to pump that stock, right?"
"6083530","6085550"," I'm always going to try to create interest in that stock."
"6087570","6091650"," But I'm also going to be, you know, selling calls up here, right?"
"6093170","6096630"," And I'm also going to be selling puts down here, right?"
"6099070","6100170"," Somewhere down in here, right?"
"6100170","6101330"," Every selling puts, right?"
"6101590","6107550"," Anything below here, I'll start selling puts so that I can make money off of my Tesla shares. "
"6109610","6113670"," And I'll be honest with you, a lot of these big time long time Tesla bulls, they know when to"
"6113670","6114130"," buy Tesla."
"6114950","6117330"," So if you want to know when to buy Tesla, I'll tell you."
"6117730","6121990"," That's Evan just saying that his sense is that there is no appetite for a higher inflation"
"6121990","6122570"," objective. "
"6123130","6124930"," That's where to buy Tesla right there."
"6126390","6128550"," That's where to buy Tesla right there, right?"
"6128550","6130190"," This was to buy Tesla right here."
"6130730","6133910"," So when you're looking right here and you're saying Tesla, I'm not saying the Tesla, I'm going to"
"6133910","6135610"," have a great year and go blast off. "
"6135950","6140490"," But if I was going to, if I'm a bull talking to you as a bull, right?"
"6142250","6147650"," About where to buy Tesla, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to give you the best bull advice"
"6147650","6148290"," possible."
"6149890","6155290"," It's the most reasonable, rational advice out there, okay?"
"6155290","6162870"," Because if you'd bought here, here, here, here, and here, you'd be doing very well for yourself at"
"6162870","6163290"," this point."
"6164410","6169610"," So what I'm going to tell you is that you're waiting for this right here. "
"6169770","6172510"," This next tag down below, you're waiting to buy."
"6174270","6175290"," That's what you're waiting for."
"6175490","6178990"," Now, even if we trade higher here, you're going to see some profit taking. "
"6179130","6181770"," And eventually, you will see a move down here."
"6182130","6183650"," And this is actually when you buy Tesla."
"6184930","6188930"," Now, when you buy Tesla down here, I'm also going to tell you as a Tesla bull, you sell puts"
"6188930","6193190"," down here and you sell calls up here and you wait for your next chance. "
"6193970","6199270"," Even if we curve up here, you wait for your next chance to buy Tesla once again over here."
"6199810","6203270"," That's the way that you'd be a Tesla bull and a productive Tesla bull."
"6203750","6206910"," When you're up there telling people, you know, buy calls right here, buy calls right here, buy"
"6206910","6209070"," calls right here, it's fucking nonsense. "
"6209770","6213030"," Not to be like, you want to be a dollar cost averaging bull."
"6213630","6215430"," You want to hold Tesla for 30 fucking years."
"6215710","6218410"," You want to support the company for 30 fucking years, 40 fucking years. "
"6219990","6223570"," Then you can see where it is, right?"
"6224690","6227030"," I'm not saying that it doesn't come up here either, right?"
"6227750","6230270"," Let's say they don't blast off up here on ER."
"6230490","6235990"," I'm saying to you that there's better places to buy Tesla calls and this ain't it."
"6236850","6243050"," Now you're going to wait for some kind of profit taking and some kind of a support zone to place"
"6243050","6244310"," your next buy for Tesla. "
"6245190","6250350"," Just be patient, just be patient and that's where you buy Tesla."
"6250990","6255250"," And you should track Tesla for moments like this because, you know, if you're quiet about it and"
"6255250","6259430"," then when it gets to that point, you step in and you tell your friends, you say, hey man, we're"
"6259430","6262870"," probably coming into a place where we're time to buy some Tesla."
"6264030","6266510"," And so right now it's not really time to buy some Tesla for me at least. "
"6267410","6276590"," I'm looking for, and I bet I'm not the only one."
"6276730","6278110"," I bet Gary Black is too."
"6279690","6280750"," He won't tell you that. "
"6284020","6287460"," He won't tell you that, but this is where you're looking to buy Tesla."
"6287680","6290100"," Like you want to buy some Tesla and buy some fucking leaps."
"6292120","6292920"," It's down here. "
"6295840","6297760"," This is where they're waiting for the Biden presidency."
"6297940","6303700"," He's not seen or heard about any document from Russia referencing earlier claim from the Kremlin."
"6306440","6307980"," This is where they're buying it, looking to buy Tesla. "
"6308180","6314000"," You can day trade it, but when people say things like, oh, I'm a fucking Tesla, Tesla bull."
"6314060","6315440"," I'm like, nah, you mean a Tesla bull."
"6316820","6318080"," That's a Tesla bull right there. "
"6322020","6323040"," That's what you're looking to buy."
"6323040","6326040"," I think that's really rare."
"6327220","6332560"," Russian government spokesperson said they were waiting at Ukraine's response to Russia's latest"
"6332560","6333720"," proposal in talks. "
"6334500","6336980"," Can you the best part about buying this down here is?"
"6337980","6339140"," I'll tell you what it is."
"6341670","6344990"," You know all those happy bulls on Twitter and on Wall Street Bets?"
"6345790","6346810"," This is where they buy it."
"6347830","6352130"," All those bulls are fucking jacked with tits and pumped to buying it down here. "
"6354970","6358970"," And you know the best part about this down here too is you feel good about it."
"6359870","6361230"," So you buy down here, right?"
"6361370","6362150"," It goes a little bit lower."
"6363110","6364650"," You're still like, that's not so bad. "
"6364910","6368510"," But I assure you, if it goes down here and you fucking bought up here, you're going to be fucking"
"6368510","6368810"," pissed."
"6371490","6372650"," You're going to be fucking pissed."
"6374290","6375730"," It's just like straight shares. "
"6375990","6381130"," Like this is what I'm talking about down here is leaps, shares, fucking spreads."
"6381210","6382710"," You fucking name it."
"6382730","6383050"," Do it all. "
"6383210","6384490"," Just buy, buy, buy."
"6386070","6387710"," Then you're not going to tell you this."
"6387830","6389330"," Some bulls out there aren't going to tell you this. "
"6389990","6391950"," They're going to fill your mind with shit."
"6393250","6395330"," But I promise you that this is where it's at."
"6396470","6398330"," And you're going to fucking love buying down here. "
"6398410","6401210"," You're going to be a fucking, you're going to be a fucking shit buying down there."
"6401990","6403110"," Now do we get down here now?"
"6403330","6403710"," Maybe not."
"6404350","6406270"," And we don't get down there until fucking May. "
"6406630","6406950"," Maybe it's June."
"6407250","6407730"," Maybe it's August."
"6407730","6412250"," But I promise you, this opportunity will present itself. "
"6412530","6415470"," And when it does, fucking go wrong."
"6418690","6420570"," Watch us go to like 2000 today."
"6422270","6423270"," That's going to be hilarious. "
"6425050","6426470"," That's always how it happens, right?"
"6427790","6428570"," So there you go."
"6429130","6431110"," Well, this should be a, this is a simple roadmap for your testable."
"6431930","6432890"," Simple roadmap. "
"6434950","6435890"," And just patience."
"6436210","6438130"," You can even, you can even set alerts, right?"
"6438730","6439770"," Create an alert, right?"
"6440090","6440750"," Create an alert here."
"6440890","6441750"," Create an alert down here. "
"6441870","6442690"," Create an alert down here."
"6443290","6445650"," You'll fuck off for the next two months, three months, month."
"6446510","6448410"," And that fucking alert goes off in rings. "
"6448410","6451830"," And you're fucking playing tennis or skiing or hiking."
"6451830","6454010"," You get all that cash, right?"
"6454290","6456210"," You just sit there and you just slam the buy button."
"6457410","6458490"," You buy it down here. "
"6458790","6460390"," Any, any of these dips down here you buy."
"6461090","6463430"," And then you get on Twitter and you tell people to buy calls."
"6463850","6469090"," And you tell people, you know, you lie to all your, all the new bulls in town to pump your"
"6469090","6469690"," stock for you. "
"6485680","6495420"," Yeah, there's, there's enough people out there on Twitter, testables on Twitter that know when to"
"6495420","6495580"," buy."
"6495800","6497080"," I tell people on Twitter when to buy."
"6497720","6498280"," It's not hard. "
"6498460","6500760"," It's not the biggest, it's not fucking rocket science."
"6502300","6503760"," When to buy, when to buy Tesla."
"6504780","6508800"," Problem is that you're, it's like, it's a coffee at all times. "
"6508800","6511440"," Buy Tesla, buy Tesla, buy Tesla, buy Tesla, buy Tesla."
"6512860","6518320"," And it's like a coffee can never just fucking never end and see you get lost in the, should I"
"6518320","6518740"," buy Tesla?"
"6522180","6523500"," Well, you want to feel good when you own Tesla."
"6524440","6526220"," Why, I think you want to feel good. "
"6527640","6529320"," I love feeling good owning Tesla."
"6529600","6530800"," It's like, it's a great feeling."
"6531780","6532900"," Like there's nothing like it. "
"6533060","6537160"," It's like, it's a kick ass feeling knowing that you own Tesla at a good price."
"6540620","6541720"," It fucking feels awesome."
"6547090","6548450"," Don't let anyone ever tell you that out. "
"6548590","6551810"," There's no reason for you to suffer owning your favorite company."
"6553110","6554110"," Absolutely no reason."
"6557220","6558380"," Like this, it's insane. "
"6558820","6559500"," Why would you want to do that?"
"6559660","6560460"," That's like, masochistic."
"6561320","6562520"," Like, I love this company."
"6564580","6569200"," I love this company, but I want to fucking whip myself while owning this company. "
"6569860","6573740"," Like you want to own a company and be like, fuck yeah, I got this at a kick ass price."
"6574660","6575300"," Fucking love it."
"6576420","6578900"," And then if someone's like, well, I didn't get it at that price. "
"6578900","6580680"," You say, well, come along with me."
"6581140","6584040"," And I'll let you know when the next opportunity is to buy."
"6585640","6590760"," And if you think that you're the guy that's like shifting the price of Tesla, you're not. "
"6591040","6592660"," There's these giant fucking banks."
"6593460","6595480"," And they're the ones that shift the price of Tesla."
"6595740","6596620"," You see it in Netflix, right?"
"6596900","6597500"," You can see it. "
"6598200","6600660"," They snap their fucking fingers and Netflix is gone."
"6602400","6603980"," So you want to own with the banks."
"6604600","6608840"," So if they ever snap their fucking fingers, you don't get caught in that fuck show. "
"6610660","6614500"," You want to own it right alongside them and love Tesla, or me, I love Tesla."
"6614600","6616300"," I know a lot of guys don't love Tesla out there."
"6619100","6620460"," Oh, fucking Cathy Woods. "
"6621100","6622160"," She's such a fucking tool."
"6622980","6623580"," She's hot though."
"6626080","6627580"," Okay, so what are you guys talking about up here?"
"6629340","6630600"," Yeah, we talked about this morning. "
"6630880","6631700"," Today's Vix Opex."
"6632180","6633120"," Will that have an impact on the market?"
"6633260","6634300"," Good question, Chris Jenna."
"6634300","6637700"," Uh, Spock Emma is positing. "
"6638480","6639620"," We talked about this earlier."
"6639620","6641740"," Spock Emma is, well, we're rehashing."
"6641880","6643340"," So anyone that's just joining us right now. "
"6644240","6648040"," So we have Spock, we have a Vix expiration day today."
"6648560","6658080"," Uh, what, uh, what, what, um, what Spock Emma is positing is that this move higher, uh, well, this"
"6658080","6658480"," move higher."
"6660260","6663800"," President Zelensky of the Ukraine saying that the Ukraine remains ready to swap. "
"6664300","6669900"," Prisoners of war in exchange for safe passions for civilians in Ukrainian troops in Maripol."
"6672800","6677760"," What they're saying with this, was that this Vix, as expiration, was tied to the, uh, Vana rally"
"6677760","6678180"," yesterday."
"6678520","6680780"," Wasn't any kind of a Vana rally like closing shorts. "
"6681320","6684560"," It had to do with, uh, with puts against the Vix."
"6686200","6691240"," And you're seeing more monetization of that into the opening bell this morning."
"6693100","6695780"," And then we had a little bit of support down below here. "
"6695780","6697020"," We saw this morning off the open."
"6697760","6703600"," And so this looks like distribution on trying, I'm continuing to monetize, uh, puts on the Vix."
"6704020","6706240"," So we trade up here, right?"
"6706700","6709120"," Monetize some more puts come back down. "
"6709260","6714040"," I don't know if we'll get back up here one more time today to monetize some more puts, but then"
"6714040","6718420"," we would eventually have a quick, uh, run down to 440."
"6719120","6726560"," Once we hit 440 for this, uh, this volatility trigger in 440, uh, we're going to be looking for,"
"6726560","6729960"," uh, the buying and bolstering of a move higher to 450."
"6732020","6735140"," Uh, for a next leg up to 450, 460, 470. "
"6735920","6742220"," If we don't see that move, if we don't see the bolstering of the, of the bold case, for the"
"6742220","6749620"," market at 440 or down here below at this, at this, uh, Vix, or at this, um, volatility trigger, uh,"
"6750280","6753480"," you would then bring out the bear case for the Elliott waivers."
"6755120","6761480"," And that sends us down, if we break below this vault trigger, uh, that breaks us down to two spots."
"6761640","6766620"," It breaks us down to 430, a retest of 435 down below here. "
"6768320","6770540"," Uh, this would be test one."
"6776170","6778090"," Well, we already tested one, I guess, right?"
"6778850","6782290"," I don't know, we can tip right wherever we want, uh, 435."
"6782290","6790630"," And then your second test would be, uh, down below at this, uh, right back here to that 410,"
"6790650","6792970"," another test below here at 413. "
"6793350","6802090"," And that lines up, uh, roughly 421 ish, over time, up to 424."
"6803530","6805230"," Somewhere down in here would be test two."
"6810170","6816410"," This, of course, would be the part of the LA wave, um, stuff that people believe in. "
"6819210","6823430"," Now, there, the one, I didn't say this earlier this morning, but I did want to mention this, uh,"
"6823530","6823970"," for where we are."
"6825850","6827890"," When we're trading in here, right?"
"6828310","6828950"," Clear all this."
"6829970","6833510"," We're trading in here, right?"
"6833970","6836690"," You're, you're still in the confines of this negative downward channel. "
"6837350","6842830"," Uh, trading above this opens up the door to larger trading area."
"6843350","6843790"," Right?"
"6843930","6849950"," You still have this available down here, but this wasn't available until we broke above that"
"6849950","6850550"," negative channel."
"6850930","6859250"," So we're looking to see, uh, this channel here hold, uh, for bulls to, to have, have their, what"
"6859250","6861790"," would he call it would be to prove their case, right?"
"6861930","6864950"," They were going up here, uh, and this opens the door to that. "
"6865230","6868350"," Without being above this channel, you don't get the door opened."
"6868950","6870570"," Uh, so the bulls want a bulk case."
"6871150","6872990"," Uh, it's being blamed on Vickspiration. "
"6873830","6877410"," Um, and you're going to want to see, you want, you want to see this hold."
"6877590","6883830"," If this doesn't hold here, and you want to get your bear on for that Elliott waiver stuff, then you"
"6883830","6884490"," should wait."
"6885310","6892610"," Um, you should wait for, if you're not already in puts, I'm in some, puts that, some free puts that"
"6892610","6895030"," I'm holding for when today and for Friday. "
"6895850","6899830"," Uh, but if you're not in puts right now, like the thing you'd want to do is you want to"
"6899830","6901190"," see us break below that volatility."
"6901770","6908110"," Uh, reject, go ahead and hire maybe once or twice, and then you take the, take the trade down to"
"6908110","6908330"," 435."
"6909470","6910570"," Take your money, right?"
"6911230","6916170"," Look for a bounce and then take the trade once more down to, uh, 424. "
"6917590","6924870"," Uh, so right now for today for Vickspiration, um, uh, we're, yeah, we're back to where we just"
"6924870","6931470"," talked about monetization of those puts, uh, excuse me, those puts on the Vicks and some OTM calls"
"6931470","6932350"," that were back here."
"6932790","6934810"," Uh, looks like that, looks like we're monetizing, right?"
"6934990","6935970"," Looks like monetizing here."
"6936170","6937210"," Looks like monetizing here. "
"6937350","6938430"," Looks like monetizing here."
"6939130","6942070"," And if those, uh, puts are monetized on the Vicks, they disappear."
"6942910","6949110"," And if you get expiration on, on options today, 20% grade and 27 SPX, you could quickly see as"
"6949110","6952210"," we head into the end of the day that we could come back down to tag 440. "
"6953070","6959930"," The question though becomes, um, if we tag down below here, if we make this move down here as the"
"6959930","6965830"," day wears on, uh, do you take the, uh, the bull case trade because we're up here now?"
"6966630","6971730"," Um, Ford, does it even open the door for the bulls to say we're going to 4 fucking 7480?"
"6973050","6978730"," Uh, but this wasn't on the table, uh, last week, none of this was on the table, just there wasn't"
"6978730","6981070"," even a chance or an opportunity for this to take place."
"6981970","6984490"," Uh, there's no guarantee this takes place, but the door is open."
"6984630","6989530"," And so if the door was closed yesterday and the bulls wanted a reason for us to go up from"
"6989530","6991690"," here, uh, this is their chance. "
"6991890","6994690"," They have their chance, uh, we're in positive gamma."
"6994950","6998810"," We're on the, you know, we're sitting on positive gamma or we're in the vault trigger at least, uh,"
"6998870","7000310"," for pause gamma, positive gamma."
"7000530","7005050"," But the bulls had no fucking case until basically, I mean, not even here. "
"7005150","7005890"," They didn't really have the case."
"7006410","7008230"," Uh, but here they have the case today."
"7008450","7013170"," So we'll see if the bulls slap on, uh, you know, 50 million dollars in fucking calls. "
"7013790","7020370"," Uh, and if they do, uh, we'll take some, some, uh, far out OTM calls with them."
"7021370","7025890"," And if they don't, um, we'll go right back into the same old regime."
"7026010","7028970"," We'll go right back into the, uh, the trade back in the channel, right?"
"7029950","7033310"," It's kind of like, it's kind of like you're walking down the road with five people and one person"
"7033310","7038370"," takes the left off the trail and, uh, you grab that person and say, stay on the fucking trail. "
"7038650","7041190"," And if that person says, fuck you, I ain't doing that."
"7041330","7046850"," There's a bar over there with titties, uh, and four of your friends jump on the, jump on the spur"
"7046850","7048670"," of the trail to go find the bar with titties."
"7049110","7050650"," You're kind of shit out of luck, right?"
"7051010","7055470"," You're the only one that's going to go down, uh, go down to four 24, where everyone else is heading"
"7055470","7056530"," up to higher numbers. "
"7056970","7058530"," Uh, so we're going to track that today."
"7059830","7066350"," And, uh, let's see and see if we, if we trade back down to this, in this channel, or if"
"7066350","7066910"," we trade higher."
"7070350","7072050"," Uh, hope that answers your question, Chris. "
"7074930","7084770"," Another 4.55s by call for 2.2 for 2.8 million for, uh, 7.15. Uh, Tesla era is"
"7084770","7088390"," going to be what you consider a bad year for Tesla."
"7089570","7090990"," Uh, what do I have to consider?"
"7090990","7099730"," I don't consider anything bad for, not bad for Tesla, but if they beat expectations, um, and then,"
"7099730","7105650"," you know, there's all, there's that you were still in that regime of inflation and shortages and"
"7105650","7107510"," the Shanghai shit is a problem."
"7107930","7109390"," The war is a problem. "
"7110190","7115150"," Uh, you don't know if China is in lockdowns, not because of really because of COVID, but because"
"7115150","7117970"," it's a backdoor way to kind of fuck US production."
"7118590","7121390"," Uh, that's a concern, uh, on the background."
"7123170","7127470"," Uh, QQQs you want to see on, I want to see the QQQs. "
"7128070","7129770"," Let's see if we have some support down here."
"7130550","7133950"," We'll type, we'll put in the Qs and we'll put that in the oven for you."
"7138230","7142410"," There's concerns there that like it's, it's basically corporate sabotage in the background. "
"7143230","7148390"," Uh, it's the same concerns that you heard from, uh, from Netflix, right, to some extent."
"7149690","7152550"," Netflix is saying they're not able to monetize in foreign markets."
"7153130","7154870"," They've got some closed foreign markets. "
"7155210","7157470"," They're using as a reason excuse, got a little bit of support down here."
"7157530","7158890"," You can see some liquidity bumping in."
"7159230","7161070"," Right, we are 445-20. "
"7161630","7163410"," By the way, down here to 443-60."
"7164070","7165810"," Let's see it right down in here."
"7166870","7167910"," Let's see it right there. "
"7170350","7172290"," Let's see that band right here of buyers."
"7184840","7189520"," If you're going to look a little closer, you got a 443-64-442-82."
"7190620","7191900"," If you break through this, we'll go to 440. "
"7193660","7198060"," Um, so, you know, like the thing is, is if they have a good, if they have a good ER,"
"7198060","7204300"," right, they're talking great about Germany, they're talking great about, uh, the U.S. Um, they're"
"7204300","7207520"," saying they're overcoming some of their shortage, shortage problems, but they still have"
"7207520","7209540"," uncertainty with, uh, with China."
"7210860","7214200"," Uh, that's a big fucking problem and shortage is, and then inflation."
"7214980","7216560"," Uh, that that's a big fucking problem. "
"7216960","7220160"," So, uh, it's not a big problem."
"7220340","7223960"," That's the neutral, um, that's the neutral ER report."
"7224500","7225640"," So that's what I'm going to go for. "
"7225760","7226280"," It is a neutral."
"7226460","7228760"," You meet expectations and guidance."
"7230160","7232820"," And, uh, guidance is a softball this year kind of too. "
"7233060","7238820"," Uh, but unless there's something that we don't know, um, some kind of headline news that hasn't"
"7238820","7243100"," been announced, um, I'm going to expect a neutral."
"7246330","7248950"," You lose seven out of three shots you take?"
"7249550","7250390"," No, no, no, no."
"7250550","7256750"," I'm saying that if you trade bull, if you take a bull trade on Tesla ERs, they tend to lose"
"7256750","7257510"," seven out of 10. "
"7259310","7259850"," They do."
"7260270","7260850"," I trade them."
"7261210","7262550"," I don't anymore, but I used to trade them. "
"7263470","7266530"," Uh, but I've made serious, so I traded the, uh, the stock split."
"7266530","7270730"," And I made, uh, fucking stupid money."
"7271210","7274710"," I made like 20,000% or something and saying like that. "
"7274870","7281230"," Fresh time is always there until I get 20 counterparts that Russia should not be allowed to attend"
"7281230","7282270"," the G20 meetings."
"7282750","7284530"," Here's how big money is hedging for NATO."
"7285330","7288130"," Uh, yeah, if you trade Tesla, you know, the trade's typically afterwards. "
"7288130","7289950"," It's not normally the day before."
"7293640","7297260"," So anyone can trade or invest in companies priced on stanions per hour."
"7298900","7305520"," Um, yeah, the people on Twitter have their different stakeholders. "
"7305920","7311920"," They have different, uh, Winky's reaffirming that you guys have to, you guys have to parse on"
"7311920","7316700"," Twitter what the motivations are of, of different Tesla bulls."
"7318140","7321700"," Um, like you'll even see Tesla bulls say I don't like day traders."
"7321940","7325440"," I don't like a fucking, I like investors and not traders. "
"7325440","7329640"," You'll hear that oftentimes on Twitter, uh, because you'll get the most honest answers."
"7329880","7335920"," You'll usually get the most honest answer from a trader, uh, because a trader's interest is usually"
"7335920","7337080"," short, right?"
"7337560","7343880"," Like it's for one day, one week, one month, uh, they usually follow a stock over the course of a"
"7343880","7346280"," year for the best times to long it."
"7347160","7349680"," Um, so that's where their focus is. "
"7349820","7352560"," Their focus isn't on like 10, 20 years, 30 years."
"7353100","7357560"," Um, so they'll like, they'll tell you publicly if I can hate traders, but then they'll monitor what"
"7357560","7362760"," traders are doing with, with Tesla because they know when the traders step in, uh, that you're,"
"7362800","7364060"," they're expecting a ramp on Tesla."
"7370530","7371290"," Yes, they are. "
"7371830","7372810"," They are cash cows."
"7373210","7374430"," We're talking different things here too."
"7374490","7375790"," We're talking about when do you buy Tesla?"
"7376550","7379470"," Not, not options trading date or day trading, uh, Tesla. "
"7379630","7380430"," I love day trading Tesla."
"7380970","7384210"," That's a completely different thing, uh, than being a Tesla investor."
"7384210","7388070"," My conversation is about when do you buy, uh, Tesla?"
"7388490","7393510"," He said some weeks ago that the market- Daily saying that she favors smooth and methodical approach"
"7393510","7394050"," to policy. "
"7394430","7397790"," They must evaluate policy's impact once accommodation is removed."
"7398730","7402370"," An expeditious march to the neutral by year end is a prudent path."
"7402990","7405610"," And then inflation is too high and policy must adjust. "
"7406630","7408730"," Commence from San Francisco fed daily."
"7409350","7410270"," Jesus Christ."
"7410270","7411110"," In Las Vegas. "
"7412070","7415750"," Raising rates purposefully to neutral is a top priority."
"7416710","7421930"," And longer run inflation, inflation expectations have been steady, but we can't be complacent."
"7422870","7424570"," He's normally, uh, dove too. "
"7429450","7431790"," The, uh, I am wondering if we're going to get a ceasefire decree."
"7432090","7436230"," Saying that once rates do reach the neutral level, the Fed needs to assess the financial conditions"
"7436230","7439930"," to see what more needs to be done."
"7440310","7443570"," I'll tell you what, you guys want a reason why the market got a fuck in all 10 highs?"
"7443990","7448250"," If they, if they fucking stop- The only thing that believes the neutral rate is around two and a"
"7448250","7448950"," half percent. "
"7452150","7452930"," Jesus Christ."
"7453330","7454610"," These fucking Fed chairs do."
"7454750","7455910"," These guys are fucking monsters. "
"7459030","7460450"," It's like a fucking sober, bro."
"7460790","7462430"," Yeah, I'll tell you what, I'll send us all time highs."
"7462690","7465510"," They're not going to have all time, but we'll test them or try to get there. "
"7466230","7467350"," If you train and rush."
"7467370","7472510"," Daily, just emphasizing that she believed the U.S. economy is unlikely to enter a recession due to"
"7472510","7473170"," Fed actions."
"7473870","7475970"," Like, I'll tell you what, I am seeing right now. "
"7477550","7480150"," There's a little bit of, a little bit of liquidity down here."
"7481090","7486490"," Look at this report right down here, 444.60. Let's see it right there."
"7490760","7492800"," You know, I'll tell you what I'll fucking see, you guys want to know. "
"7493220","7495300"," You guys want to know what I'll fucking send us up there?"
"7496240","7502780"," If you heard that, if you heard that there was a truce with Ukraine and Russia, that'll send us."
"7504220","7507660"," It doesn't even matter, Ukraine just folds."
"7509040","7509940"," Any kind of truce. "
"7511500","7517800"," You're going to see, you might see a quick drop in the market for like five minutes."
"7519060","7524180"," You might see like 20, 30 point drop in the markets, but then you're going to see a fucking rocket"
"7524180","7527300"," ship go up like 300 points in three or four days."
"7530300","7543370"," And I'm seeing a lot of news past eight, 12 hours, a lot of news hinting at"
"7543370","7547090"," association of the possibilities. "
"7549130","7552770"," So that would be your headline, if you wanted a headline."
"7554070","7557010"," I said some weeks ago that the market breadth indicator can tell when to buy Tesla."
"7557010","7564910"," Yes, but I said to you that you want to use that indicator with just the spy, then you'd apply"
"7564910","7566150"," that to Tesla. "
"7569030","7571570"," I don't know if Elon's tweeted that he'll be on the air call."
"7572010","7576310"," I like when Elon's there, I don't like Elon not on any air calls, I like him there."
"7579410","7580790"," Yeah, it's not a good indicator. "
"7581110","7587210"," Don't use that indicator on Tesla, use it on the spy, and then you would use the spy as hey,"
"7587270","7588650"," I can probably buy Tesla now."
"7589690","7594950"," The one problem, the two with that is you want to ensure that Tesla's not an corrective action or"
"7594950","7595810"," any other ticker."
"7596210","7600150"," You want to make sure that they're not in the middle, they're not part, and how you tell that is"
"7600150","7607170"," if a ticker is not participating in the market going up, and is not, if a market is not"
"7607170","7611030"," participating in the market going up, you can tell that they are in a corrective action. "
"7611890","7619450"," If a ticker is not participating in the market going down, you can tell that the banks are long in"
"7619450","7619550"," it."
"7619650","7622010"," As a matter of fact, today is a prime fucking example."
"7622830","7628750"," When they dumped Netflix last night, the spy should have went down, and it didn't, because they are"
"7628750","7632590"," long to an extent in other ways. "
"7632830","7635910"," They're long the spy, but they're short at Netflix, right?"
"7636290","7644790"," So you can actually see when things don't participate with the banks are doing, don't fuck around"
"7644790","7645230"," with it, right?"
"7645470","7646210"," Don't fuck around with spy."
"7646810","7651710"," If they're long the spy or at least neutral spy or they're trying to dump the VIX or short the"
"7651710","7653750"," VIX, you can see that."
"7653990","7654770"," Plane is fucking day. "
"7657740","7661320"," Do we want to bring you a conspiracy talk to us about playing great Tesables?"
"7661600","7665380"," Oh, I think there are great Tesables, but it's hard to get through."
"7666720","7669840"," It's hard to get through the noise, the complete package noise."
"7670180","7671120"," It's hard to get through that. "
"7671800","7673400"," Especially as a new Tesla bull."
"7673620","7679580"," Don't tell me out there that it's not easy to decipher who to be following, which Tesables to be"
"7679580","7681480"," following, and for what reasons to be following them."
"7681800","7682320"," It's not easy. "
"7683220","7684760"," It's no fucking way it's easy."
"7691170","7692170"," Yeah, who's talking about?"
"7692270","7694690"," We've just gone through the close cash equity trade across Europe."
"7694690","7698730"," The DAX unofficially up about 1.4 percent, the cat got up 1."
"7698830","7702930"," And a third percent while the FTSU 100 finished up roughly a third percent. "
"7702930","7704610"," Neil knows what he's talking about."
"7705250","7710590"," Treasury yields follow US yields lower, the UK 10-year down four and a half on the day, the German"
"7710590","7714270"," 10-year also down about four, and the US 10-year down six."
"7715390","7719550"," What I like on, what I like to how I like to trade Tesla earnings recently is- Euro trading"
"7719550","7721870"," at 108.56 currently. "
"7722210","7724690"," That's up about 67 pips on the day."
"7725550","7730510"," You see some general weakness in the US dollar as US yields have lead rates lower."
"7731850","7738170"," My best trades on Tesla of late have been, you wait till the ER is done, and you trade it"
"7738170","7741550"," the day after, the week after, and you fucking just print. "
"7742190","7743590"," Fucking print every time."
"7745210","7746610"," Facebook isn't a free fall."
"7747550","7749310"," I haven't looked at Facebook yet. "
"7749650","7751110"," Warren McPane isn't attending anytime soon."
"7751790","7752790"," It's been going on for eight years."
"7752990","7753830"," Yeah, I agree with that, Chase. "
"7754850","7757810"," I'm going to agree with that statement."
"7758490","7765550"," I don't agree with that statement in terms of a headline event for the markets."
"7766210","7766990"," Two different things. "
"7769000","7773600"," Oh, yeah, XLF."
"7773760","7778520"," There was like, wasn't there like a $7 million fucking buy on a little bit of support again on the"
"7778520","7778740"," spy?"
"7779320","7782300"," Wasn't like a $7 million bet on XLF?"
"7782620","7783440"," Oh, yeah, dude."
"7783900","7787780"," That XLF golden ticket's printing huge, huge. "
"7787780","7790160"," That golden ticket on XLF is printing."
"7792740","7794420"," We talked about that yesterday, right?"
"7795420","7796520"," Talk about XLF."
"7796940","7800220"," Do you have any just buy and hold long positions?"
"7800520","7802000"," Captain or city actively trade everything. "
"7802880","7807800"," I used to do a lot of buy and hold, and buy and hold long positions."
"7808100","7809320"," I'm not this year."
"7810480","7813320"," My take on this year is you have to actively manage. "
"7813320","7826600"," So one year, this"
"7826600","7828420"," is buy and hold environment here."
"7828640","7828860"," Hold on."
"7830180","7831720"," This is a buy and hold environment. "
"7834560","7835520"," This is not."
"7835980","7840060"," This is a this environment until we're told."
"7840920","7846160"," I mean, some things about the market, I believe, I think the market generally gets like, Hey, we're"
"7846160","7847160"," in this kind of an environment. "
"7847720","7849240"," Hey, you can buy a dip and it'll print."
"7849780","7857820"," I really do think that until like September, July that you'll see lower lows, or at least you'll"
"7857820","7862140"," see similar lows, similar maybe."
"7865420","7867800"," I think you'll least see similar lows. "
"7869860","7871120"," Maybe something like this."
"7871260","7875520"," Even if you're bullish for sideways, you'll still see returns to these lows."
"7876840","7882330"," So stuff like this, at least in 10 of the year. "
"7882630","7887370"," So that means you have to manage it to buy and sell, buy and sell, buy and sell, buy and"
"7887370","7888570"," sell, buy and sell."
"7889770","7891470"," That's the regime that we're in currently."
"7891770","7893850"," It's proved itself since back in September. "
"7895350","7901050"," So no, I used to, but the past couple of years I have, and then of course I stopped."
"7901210","7902970"," I stopped trading single stocks last year."
"7903870","7908530"," I remember last January, I think, matter of fact, horse lover, fat and I had a conversation on"
"7908530","7909310"," Twitter, I think. "
"7910610","7913930"," I want to say January of 2021."
"7914210","7919910"," And I said, I said, I've removed all of my individual tickers, and I'm only going to trade the spy"
"7919910","7920550"," at this point."
"7921510","7927610"," I traded Tesla since then, some individual ticker tickers, but I haven't done anything for like one"
"7927610","7930910"," to two, three years out in some time. "
"7931810","7937590"," And I've actually mostly focused on indexes the past exclusively since September or December."
"7941770","7945910"," And we're not back in that regime yet."
"7947770","7953150"," Once we do, if you want to know when we get back in that regime, when you can do that,"
"7953370","7960070"," you're looking for you're looking for a resumption, right?"
"7960070","7965270"," You're looking for some kind of a trend that's up consistently, right?"
"7965470","7966590"," We don't have that yet. "
"7967250","7971270"," You can actually miss all this noise in here to get back into that trend too."
"7971590","7977730"," You could miss all this and still win for the next three years, if we resume that buy it and"
"7977730","7978170"," forget it."
"7978430","7983430"," But until then, it's buy it to a price, buy it to a price, buy it to a price, buy"
"7983430","7986210"," it to a price on every market liquidation event. "
"7993280","8000240"," Elon did tweet that he'll be on the art site."
"8000240","8000660"," Good."
"8001520","8002640"," Yeah, I can check Amazon. "
"8002860","8004580"," I'll look at IWM for you right now."
"8006630","8007690"," Let me go through these."
"8011200","8012460"," There are indicator clues. "
"8016040","8020700"," There's not much going on on what an hour."
"8023970","8025350"," Not much going on here."
"8026830","8033690"," It's just in the current order book and configure column aggregate. "
"8035710","8038870"," I got a whole bunch of fucking indicators I want to put on here for you guys."
"8039110","8040410"," I still haven't put them on."
"8054700","8056300"," Traffic, trade and VWAP. "
"8058940","8068410"," $20 million in put spot on $2.06."
"8075790","8090830"," There's a lot of negative $2.10. Man,"
"8091010","8091570"," it's not pretty."
"8093070","8095030"," It is boost guy down below too."
"8095030","8096630"," It's like it's fighting for its life. "
"8105600","8110500"," And every time I'm looking, every time I look at IWM, I'm like, man, it's like a bear's wet dream."
"8112120","8117430"," It's like a bear's wet dream."
"8131790","8133350"," Bears want it back down to 160. "
"8138410","8139570"," They want it so bad."
"8140270","8140830"," They can taste it."
"8140830","8149010"," I bet they want 140. "
"8159980","8169350"," There's a lot of pressure on IWM."
"8170230","8178890"," With that being said, the pressure that's on IWM is protecting longs."
"8180070","8185790"," Let me explain this better to you in a better way. "
"8186850","8194610"," So IWM, forget being a bear for a minute, okay?"
"8198770","8200170"," Banks have to buy the market."
"8202650","8206930"," What banks have done past couple of weeks here is they just re-hedged."
"8208750","8209809"," Matter of fact, I'll bring it up. "
"8209950","8211889"," If you were in Discord, I'll bring it up for you right now."
"8212910","8215049"," I'll show you guys the hedging that's taking place."
"8216910","8220350"," So I'm going to look up a filter ticker by date. "
"8220370","8221790"," I'm going to show you guys something in here."
"8222690","8225629"," I don't know if you guys can maybe screenshot this and post it somewhere."
"8228809","8230170"," This week, last week. "
"8230590","8236049"," Let's do this week."
"8236150","8236969"," We'll start with this week."
"8241420","8243520"," I want this week and we're going to look at IWM. "
"8247059","8248440"," It's taking a minute here for me to get."
"8249139","8250020"," Oh, not date."
"8250660","8251580"," I want to buy ticker. "
"8251940","8252680"," So IWM."
"8256889","8259010"," And I want you to see this if you can."
"8259150","8259490"," Look at this. "
"8262730","8267670"," So this was, well, today we've got $20 million in IWM puts."
"8268049","8269790"," It's pretty fucking big."
"8270790","8271309"," Okay. "
"8272309","8273270"," That's just today."
"8273750","8280629"," And then if you're going to do this or do this week, it's actually even more ferocious."
"8281490","8283709"," $24 million this week at IWM. "
"8285230","8288309"," It's pretty, pretty big bearish bet against IWM."
"8288590","8290049"," Key here though is that it's not."
"8290450","8292330"," We had $24 million last week. "
"8292490","8296290"," So $50 million bet in two weeks against IWM."
"8297790","8299049"," You can see right here too."
"8301010","8305830"," Pretty fucking big bet against, it's from May 20th. "
"8306570","8307990"," Giant bet on IWM."
"8308570","8315610"," So with that being made, with that, that being met, that being made, the question is, do they"
"8315610","8318750"," follow up with actual put flow on IWM?"
"8319850","8326750"," And what the prevailing attitude is that the banks still have to buy equities."
"8326950","8332190"," So that they're going to buy this because they have an added put flow on top of their hedging. "
"8334170","8336290"," That they're now well hedged."
"8336670","8342629"," That they have hedges protecting their long positions in IWM."
"8343350","8347170"," So initially, you would think that the market's going to go down due to that hedging. "
"8347930","8354389"," But without a trigger for that flow, or for that hedge, some put flow for that hedge to actually"
"8354389","8356610"," trigger, they're well protected."
"8356610","8362950"," They'll just let those puts expire worthless and buy the market for ER season."
"8364010","8367770"," And if the ER is trying to be shit, the market starts to sell off. "
"8367950","8371650"," They'll free buy more puts and make bank off of it."
"8371870","8374570"," But you can see IWM is going up."
"8374809","8380850"," So if you were to buy puts here to protect yourself, you guys shouldn't always be out there with"
"8380850","8382410"," just calls or just puts. "
"8383190","8390450"," You should be buying both sides or protection or complex trades, just holding calls or puts."
"8391150","8392450"," That's not how this works, right?"
"8394190","8396410"," So you can see the market moving higher here."
"8396890","8398570"," There is some resistance at 210. "
"8399650","8401810"," We can see that I'm book map up here."
"8401990","8403750"," So do I think we can get 210, sir?"
"8404090","8405390"," I like the idea of getting 210."
"8405890","8407890"," I even like the idea of us trading higher. "
"8408510","8410770"," And this would be the key, right?"
"8410770","8413470"," For a reason for the market to go higher."
"8413750","8416730"," You've got banks that are hedged down here, right?"
"8419140","8423640"," And in case something bad happens in the ER season, they're properly hedged."
"8424380","8431400"," You can see the effects of that hedging by us trading down here and trading down here. "
"8431780","8433480"," And trading down here."
"8434740","8437280"," And trading down here this past week, right?"
"8438300","8443620"," But we're starting to head higher now puts are becoming or they're losing value."
"8444100","8450460"," But if anything happens between some fucked up thing with the war or fucking 1% rate increase or"
"8450460","8451780"," something, they're hedged. "
"8452300","8463040"," Now, otherwise, if those events don't happen, if we have a truce in Ukraine, if we have nothing"
"8463040","8472660"," unexpected in the May, in the May FOMC and then OPEC, we might have some weakness, right?"
"8472880","8477780"," But if we don't have anything to trigger a sign below, well, you end up having, if we end up"
"8477780","8480320"," having some good news at any point, we're going to fucking blast off."
"8481360","8485220"," We're going to fucking blast off to, you know, to probably 230."
"8486160","8486980"," Wouldn't shock me. "
"8489160","8490760"," So what does that mean for you?"
"8490880","8495840"," It means that you hedge yourself with some puts, maybe some put back spreads for like a sell the"
"8495840","8498160"," fucking news and then you go long the market."
"8501530","8504630"," I think that's the point they're trying to make for you."
"8505090","8506830"," And the put back spreads, you'd do something nasty. "
"8507130","8513590"," Maybe there's chemical weapons in Ukraine or maybe, I don't know, maybe every company comes out and"
"8513590","8517690"," says, we've been drinking fucking Budweiser's during the lockdowns."
"8517990","8522810"," And by the way, we didn't create anything new and inflation's not coming or not going away and"
"8522810","8526710"," we're having recession and all whatever the fuck that newt that horrible news is going to be."
"8527770","8528930"," Shanghai fucked us. "
"8529190","8533450"," We don't have anything that you'd buy some put back spreads here."
"8534350","8536670"," For one 50, maybe a 150 price target 162."
"8537170","8541210"," That protects you in case you're long, that doesn't work out for you. "
"8541870","8542690"," So price target above 210."
"8544830","8551470"," I doubt you're going to get, you might get slightly higher, but I bet it's 210 for the near term."
"8553070","8554830"," And then you're, you know, hoping for some good news. "
"8555010","8557810"," You're going to check the news every day and see if there's a cessation of fighting."
"8558310","8559770"," You're going to check the news to see."
"8559890","8560990"," This is a longer trade out of him. "
"8560990","8562690"," It was always like a one to three months trade."
"8563290","8564410"," I never trade out of him in today."
"8564730","8568550"," I always trade it like one week, one three weeks, a month, three months out. "
"8569490","8570430"," Tends to take some time."
"8572470","8574410"," Humana, absolutely, or bearish in this."
"8575050","8575670"," But who cares?"
"8575910","8578890"," You just, you just protect yourself in this trade, easy trade to protect. "
"8579750","8581730"," And you can see that they've actually done it."
"8581810","8587710"," You can see that bears have actively, um, hedges are banks have actively hedges themselves."
"8588090","8589250"," I should rephrase that. "
"8590070","8592350"," Coming to some resistance on QQQ's currently."
"8594190","8596990"," Slightly more sellers than buyers right here."
"8597870","8599870"," Looks like some traffic. "
"8603330","8606230"," Some pretty big resistance here on the other QQQ's currently."
"8606930","8607970"," Might get a squeeze."
"8608210","8610070"," If you get a squeeze off of that right there. "
"8610430","8617950"," Care for reporting first quarter group sales of 20.2 billion euros."
"8617950","8622410"," That's up nine percent or three point four percent on a like basis."
"8622410","8628930"," Care for damn three 48. "
"8629890","8631090"," The Q's, baby."
"8633150","8634550"," The Q's look looking delicious."
"8646480","8648040"," The Q's looking squeezy. "
"8650280","8651660"," If there's no resistance here."
"8658960","8660940"," Let's see what's going on."
"8662440","8663320"," Dangerous trade. "
"8664600","8667060"," But certainly, certainly juicy."
"8671770","8676830"," Release me, president, the car, a special 2020 meeting to convey a message through Russian leaders"
"8676830","8678310"," to end the war in Ukraine."
"8681940","8686020"," Yeah, if we were to get, if we were to get a cessation of hostilities here today. "
"8686420","8691460"," You're a blast in the swaps panel ruling that Russia is in potential default."
"8693160","8695640"," So we're coming right into Vwap on the Q's right here."
"8695780","8697700"," We could get a rejection as a dangerous trade. "
"8698220","8701560"," But if you took this trade long and if we break higher here."
"8702320","8706340"," It looks like you could see a rejection rejecting currently at the moment."
"8706560","8711580"," But if we break above here, if you find some buyers, let's look at the hair indicator. "
"8712480","8717420"," Let's see if we got some Q's calls or Q's puts coming in right now."
"8718780","8720960"," AMC calls currently some spy puts."
"8722800","8726060"," XLV puts to be another way to sort. "
"8726400","8730860"," And Russia's foreign minister Lavrov telling his Turkish counterpart that the outcome of talks with"
"8730860","8736500"," Ukraine completely depends on Q's readiness to take into account Russia's lawful demands."
"8737560","8739440"," Statement here from the Russian foreign minister."
"8740980","8741940"," We're in here at 348. "
"8742780","8749020"," I don't know if you get there, but if it does roll over, death and destruction for the Q's."
"8750000","8751760"," There are some call buyers here."
"8752220","8753260"," It's a dangerous trade. "
"8754500","8757700"," Let's bring up QQQ's."
"8761330","8762750"," Hair indicators turn green here."
"8762930","8763490"," Slay more sellers. "
"8769710","8771410"," Well, that is looking juicy."
"8771410","8776010"," Oh, yeah, that's looking juicy."
"8777070","8777470"," Isn't it?"
"8778830","8780210"," That's looking fucking juicy. "
"8781250","8782950"," Dangerous trade, but poof."
"8784270","8786650"," I could fucking print that right there."
"8811100","8813860"," I'm watching a lot of put flow in the Q's right now. "
"8815440","8818260"," You're going to see bears getting really fucking bears here."
"8819140","8821140"," If the Q's break here."
"8837580","8839300"," First stop, 338. "
"8839300","8839520"," 338."
"8844310","8844810"," 335."
"8856710","8858110"," And there's some support at 340. "
"8858630","8862930"," You can see it right here, but it looks like it's moved up to where we currently are."
"8863570","8865970"," Yeah, 335 price target."
"8867150","8871230"," If it doesn't break 448, it's a pretty big fucking move. "
"8873990","8876090"," It's going to be interesting to want to watch right here."
"8878630","8880230"," Let's look at a NDX."
"8882090","8883390"," Let's see what that tells us. "
"8888580","8890620"," I'm not watching the VIX2 right now."
"8893680","8896380"," I don't try the Q's like I used to, but I will look at it."
"8897200","8898960"," I used to love trade the Q's. "
"8932910","8934850"," So if I try the Q's today, right?"
"8935050","8943510"," If I, if I was pretty much in the Q's today, but when I do try the Q's, I always"
"8943510","8945330"," like to look at these bigger levels down here."
"8946830","8948410"," It's kind of a precarious place to be."
"8960750","8969030"," On this chart, I'd be looking to buy this down below here, for this here. "
"8969570","8974030"," You'd take this trade and then you'd wait to take this trade, then wait to take that trade."
"8974150","8975150"," That's how I trade the Q's."
"8976110","8980290"," I don't fuck around though in the middle. "
"8981710","8989170"," So my point to you is, okay, the Q's on their own look like they're they're bullish, but this was"
"8989170","8989710"," the trade."
"8990330","8997710"," And I wouldn't take this trade long on the Q's until we touched here again for this trade hire."
"9000350","9003870"," And I would, I would pick this trade up once again above this level here. "
"9005710","9007950"," But before we are right now, it's dangerous."
"9018850","9020270"," That doesn't mean I can't trade up here."
"9020390","9022430"," It just means that it's dangerous. "
"9022830","9028710"," Like as a Q's trader, when I am a Q's trader, I trade these levels, trade in between these levels,"
"9028970","9029110"," right?"
"9031610","9034270"," And they're fairly easy to see how you trade inside of them."
"9035610","9040570"," Now, some of buyer back down at 13, 788, 96, this is from a buyer down here."
"9042330","9044370"," And this actually bolsters the bull case too. "
"9044490","9049770"," But if you get that bounce down there, you get that one, two, and we shoot higher."
"9053190","9055170"," One, two, three, boom, shoot higher."
"9055690","9057130"," I mean, it's going to be a fucking rocket ship. "
"9059680","9065760"," And that would lend itself to a close on the weakness on Q's."
"9067840","9074980"," And if you've got one in two supports, you're looking for a trade hire either today or tomorrow."
"9077080","9079520"," Bearcase here is this breaks. "
"9080360","9084040"," If you break this 13, 788, that sends the spy lower."
"9084680","9086100"," And we're back in bolt and bear town again."
"9088600","9089500"," Hope that helps. "
"9091740","9092940"," No man's landing here."
"9097550","9098950"," So there are the Q's."
"9106330","9107430"," Can I check Amazon?"
"9107770","9109550"," Yeah, I'll check Amazon for you right now, Binky. "
"9111470","9115990"," Now that Q's, look at the Q's, the answer is the same question on Amazon as well."
"9116810","9118190"," We'll let Amazon load up."
"9125670","9126630"," I need to trade more today. "
"9126730","9127510"," And I'm not trading today."
"9127650","9128470"," I'm pissing about it."
"9134650","9135790"," Oh, nope. "
"9138000","9138980"," Can use this one out."
"9141480","9142040"," CLB."
"9145220","9148100"," And what are we looking for here?"
"9149900","9156100"," How am I going to get those things?"
"9156500","9157320"," Get your add-ons. "
"9157700","9158100"," Hero indicator."
"9159620","9159760"," Close."
"9160820","9161180"," All right. "
"9162240","9164000"," I'm going to bring this down a little bit."
"9166140","9167120"," I'm going to load this up."
"9192480","9194300"," Support at three for 3050. "
"9194580","9203280"," I'm going to assume that this tags along that number of that 13, 788 on NDX on NASDAQ."
"9204400","9206180"," So you'll look for a bounce down here."
"9206340","9207280"," This would be the second bounce. "
"9208020","9210740"," If you could place the buy here 3050, if the market can hold."
"9213860","9214680"," Just a second here."
"9222410","9223810"," Major support at 3000. "
"9224810","9227390"," This would be more than more than TICEFOL for as a bull."
"9230990","9235850"," I think I commented on Amazon wanting to fucking commit to do or some pugo yesterday."
"9236510","9239850"," Because Amazon is not looking fucking good. "
"9241390","9246290"," Like when you start to think about, when you start to think about all that fucking, that dude, that"
"9246290","9250350"," Netflix, that Netflix fucking ER was no fucking joke."
"9250350","9256110"," Like certain companies must have been like, shit, the cat was let out of the bag."
"9258070","9263470"," We talked, remember we talked to the open yesterday, we talked to you about the Shanghai stuff,"
"9263690","9263750"," right?"
"9263910","9266850"," The shortages and the people being locked up and now it's going to become more news. "
"9267290","9268010"," And it did, right?"
"9268310","9269210"," It's becoming more news."
"9269950","9273650"," It became news in the whole Netflix, Russia thing."
"9277330","9279910"," And today support around 3000, is what I'm going to call it. "
"9286810","9291840"," I was thinking about Amazon yesterday."
"9295560","9296940"," Amazon's a great ticker to trade."
"9297640","9297980"," It's like AMD. "
"9299020","9300960"," I traded this ticker for some time too."
"9301300","9302800"," It's a fucking gangster ticker."
"9304600","9306040"," It's such an easy trade. "
"9321700","9323060"," It's a bank favorite."
"9330550","9332070"," Banks fucking love Amazon."
"9332470","9334570"," It's like Walmart in the 80s and 90s and shit. "
"9343910","9345270"," Kind of the same thing, right?"
"9348070","9357010"," I haven't traded Amazon some time either."
"9357890","9358650"," But I used to trade it."
"9359170","9360130"," I used to love trading it. "
"9364660","9366260"," It's a beautiful fucking channel."
"9366700","9367180"," Look at that channel."
"9368260","9369780"," So much money in that channel. "
"9376160","9379900"," Two, three, four, the reverse course."
"9381800","9383300"," Get buyer anywhere down here."
"9383500","9384300"," 2,900. "
"9386260","9387860"," And I get it right there."
"9390400","9391820"," All the way down to 2,600."
"9392200","9392820"," I'm going to be a buyer. "
"9396220","9397420"," Right there."
"9403910","9404790"," Intraday support."
"9407410","9408310"," The 3000. "
"9413060","9415220"," Sold off, traded higher."
"9416580","9417300"," Trap buyers, right?"
"9417640","9419880"," Sold off, worn out some more trap buyers."
"9421040","9424360"," Sell off, come higher. "
"9425340","9431300"," If we can get down at 24 or 2800, even 28 or 3000 price target above at"
"9431300","9436800"," 3571."
"9440480","9441180"," 3571."
"9445700","9448020"," I guess I have 71, yeah. "
"9448660","9450260"," So maybe lower there."
"9466160","9467100"," Let's save."
"9470840","9472040"," It's June, huh?"
"9472320","9473140"," It's kind of far away. "
"9473880","9474280"," Nope."
"9482280","9483000"," Right there."
"9489090","9490870"," I'm going to look for some weakness. "
"9499900","9500820"," Right there."
"9506060","9507480"," There you go, Amazon."
"9519500","9525940"," I can't get back up there. "
"9526080","9526900"," It might be able to."
"9527380","9528380"," I'm going to have to change that."
"9532540","9533740"," Maybe something like that. "
"9537780","9538600"," Trade it up."
"9538740","9539540"," We trade it down."
"9545150","9546310"," We have that wrong. "
"9558450","9559650"," Let me just second here."
"9559910","9565870"," When's Amazon's, uh, when's Amazon's ER?"
"9568070","9569230"," That's the actual date."
"9573890","9574410"," 428. "
"9576750","9577850"," Let me just second here."
"9582260","9583260"," 428."
"9594650","9596490"," Just second, I'm going to, I'm going to. "
"9610490","9611490"," 428."
"9614370","9615370"," 428."
"9618520","9619300"," Right there. "
"9626410","9634710"," Let"
"9647290","9668870"," me"
"9676230","9676330"," just second here."
"9688310","9688990"," All right."
"9690730","9691810"," Something more like this. "
"9692570","9693290"," Week today."
"9693870","9695130"," I don't think it's really matters."
"9695310","9695750"," It really matters. "
"9695890","9697870"," I think we get it back up here for the ER."
"9698230","9699390"," I think we sell off their ER."
"9701390","9704750"," And then I think, uh, we, we, we, we nail it. "
"9707730","9709190"," I think we nail it comes summertime."
"9712330","9713230"," Something like that."
"9719850","9723910"," I'm suspect right now, some of these companies, they rely on China and Russia. "
"9725070","9725850"," I'm not going to lie."
"9734250","9739110"," The only thing that would change that would be headline news, like, like a cessation of hostilities"
"9739110","9742270"," and I'd say, all that shit goes out the window."
"9743010","9748570"," And then you need to be able to, um, that you need to be able to shift to that. "
"9750910","9758210"," I can't take it out counts on no one's like, like, like ending hot, uh, like ending war."
"9758630","9760570"," Like, yeah, you can't say, yeah, we're going to end war."
"9763430","9764950"," All right, trade the news. "
"9768850","9769950"," That's really weird."
"9774250","9774650"," Okay."
"9774810","9775670"," So market internals update. "
"9776690","9781410"," We've got New York Stock Exchange volume, 283 million shares, 5% below it's three month average."
"9781970","9788590"," Advancement is lead decline is 1.9 to 1 NASDAQ volume, 2.12 billion shares, even with its three"
"9788590","9789130"," month average."
"9789310","9792730"," Advancement is lead decline is 1.3 to 1 slightly positive of the day. "
"9793390","9809830"," Vic's index is down, uh, 6% at 20.10. Let"
"9809830","9811510"," me see who else is on the docket for today."
"9815410","9817330"," So we got Evans that was at 1130."
"9817470","9818170"," It's now 1205. "
"9818570","9825050"," We have Raphael Bostik at 1 p.m. and we've got the beige book at two, be aware of that"
"9825050","9834920"," beige book at 2 p.m. Also of note, uh, today we also have"
"9834920","9842540"," a Tesla ER after the belt Alcoa, United Airlines, Lamb Research, Steel Dynamics."
"9843700","9849700"," We've got Kinder and Morgan, CSX, another big one, Whirlpool, Aquafax, and Crown Castle."
"9852340","9854300"," I got to mute this so they can hear people in the background. "
"9864130","9870850"," So you may be looking for some volatility between the 1 and 2 p.m. Hour kind of in the"
"9870850","9874770"," middle here, same little dip fires down below it, 445, 0."
"9875650","9880670"," Sellers again still above at that 447, 447, 6, 3 as well."
"9881390","9884330"," So it's just back and forth this morning."
"9887030","9887870"," So cancel. "
"9890510","9897310"," Just that back and forth trade by the dips, sell the rips above at 447, 5 and 4, 4, 8,"
"9897490","9897830"," 0."
"9906930","9908410"," Let me see what you guys are talking about."
"9908530","9910830"," Yeah, it's not that same negative flow too."
"9917410","9918270"," Whirls take now. "
"9918350","9919950"," I love that juicy talk."
"9920150","9920710"," I'm down to clown."
"9921150","9923470"," There's snake venom in the water at the high on the cues. "
"9924330","9929870"," 345 was 3.4. Now it's fitting at 0.37. Just a note, see flow five minutes ago in Tesla."
"9930610","9935390"," Daily saying that she believed the flight to safety is one reason for the shift in 10-year yields."
"9940390","9944590"," I did see the million dollar, anytime with the million dollar calls on Tesla. "
"9945010","9949050"," There was a whole slew of negative calls on like XLV heads with negative calls."
"9949490","9953190"," I started a couple of Tesla trades for like a million bucks earlier."
"9953650","9958490"," 1132, there was a trade at 4.2, 1050, $4.2 million on Tesla. "
"9959430","9963910"," Another test for Tesla trade, $4.22, $527,000."
"9964730","9966750"," Wave of calls on AMC."
"9968170","9972790"," And then a bunch of calls against the index is up until about 12 PM. "
"9973630","9978030"," That's now 12.08 and you're watching some unusual call activity."
"9978390","9981130"," PHM is unusual half a billion on Facebook."
"9983070","9988110"," The Dow 5.2073 C for $31,000 high. "
"9988110","9992970"," I'll go score VVV, Victor, Victor, Victor, unusual call flow."
"9994870","9997290"," Calls on HYG, that's good to see too."
"10007330","10011650"," Yeah, I'm tough on the, I'm really tough right now on Netflix. "
"10011950","10012530"," I shouldn't be."
"10014770","10018290"," So let me look at NDX and see if we're going to catch a bounce down there or not."
"10020290","10025870"," Yeah, you're seeing this, just the slow sell on daily saying that she does expect residential"
"10025870","10028930"," housing remains strong, but not quite as much as before. "
"10029530","10035530"," If you want to long a tech stock Tesla or anything else, right, just be just be keeping your eye"
"10035530","10036650"," on NDX right here."
"10036730","10038190"," This is what I use to trade Tesla too."
"10038190","10040690"," I use NDX to trade Tesla. "
"10041470","10047050"," NDX is pretty slow, but to be honest with it, NDX and tech stocks are slower than people say"
"10047050","10052450"," they're not, but I find them to be way slower and way more forgiving than the spy in some regards"
"10052450","10056190"," to tighten this up a little bit."
"10057350","10058750"," But this is what you're looking for, right?"
"10059530","10064950"," When I use to trade fucking, I use to trade fucking NDX often, right?"
"10065210","10065910"," This is what I'm looking for."
"10067410","10071590"," A tap above boom, and then I'm maybe looking for this to trail off. "
"10071850","10074430"," I'm sure there's a million other traders out there doing the same thing."
"10074430","10080230"," There's some other inter-day stuff you can be looking for, but dude, NDX tends to go coast to"
"10080230","10080490"," coast."
"10080690","10085510"," You could be like, yeah, cap, we're going to bounce down here at 13,973. "
"10085850","10087030"," Trust me, cap, we're bouncing."
"10087230","10091450"," We might bounce here, but I always love the coast to coast on NDX."
"10091690","10093530"," It's like people like spies the easiest. "
"10093790","10100870"," I'm like, fuck, no, fucking, if you take, usually if you take the NDX and just chop it up, you'll"
"10100870","10103390"," get, at some point, like a full boom."
"10104010","10109610"," And then even if it takes 10, 20 minutes or three hours, you'll see like it eventually tags and"
"10109610","10111870"," then it will move up or breaks through."
"10112130","10118590"," And then you can take that short, but the cues are very forgiving in some respects, where the spy"
"10118590","10119150"," is not. "
"10122030","10127830"," I don't know if you guys trade using the NASDAQ chart with the cues, trades or if you use it"
"10127830","10131710"," with how many of you guys use it with when you're picking up calls and puts on Apple or whatever"
"10131710","10132750"," Amazon."
"10140670","10144750"," Maybe if rates go up and there's chip shortage or hurting consumers, lower earnings, do you think"
"10144750","10146850"," there is any chance that Dell goes above 50?"
"10147410","10148470"," No idea, take a look."
"10148710","10149950"," I will take a look at Dell though. "
"10154730","10156910"," BS, QQQ, down big and spy flat."
"10159510","10160970"," You're going to look at what, Winky?"
"10160970","10166990"," I always like, dude, Winky's got some fucking great trades, baller fucking trades."
"10169130","10170670"," I'll go look at Dell next. "
"10171030","10172710"," I haven't traded Dell in a long time."
"10175520","10177280"," Oh fucking, hey man."
"10178180","10179880"," Dell, jesus. "
"10180420","10185420"," Lots of accumulation in Dell too, huh?"
"10186340","10187280"," We'll keep going up."
"10189240","10190840"," Aw, Winky, come on bro."
"10192560","10197600"," Uh, who's fucking hilarious?"
"10199120","10202940"," Dude, my fucking mods like fucking the mods in here are fucking awesome. "
"10205140","10207420"," I get some fucking bitchin' mods."
"10211140","10216260"," I always, my picture of the mods, I picture the mods just scouring individual tickers all night"
"10216260","10216580"," long."
"10218500","10222740"," I'm just trying to put a show together and I get mods that are fucking, they like that on the,"
"10222860","10228120"," they like the, like the, like the Taverness library, the little library at Oxford and they're"
"10228120","10233140"," fucking just spending all their nights and days just, just perusing individual tickers. "
"10234160","10238400"," I can, uh, okay."
"10241060","10242380"," So what do we know, right?"
"10242960","10244080"," This is beautiful in here."
"10245620","10247300"," This is absolutely beautiful. "
"10248140","10250640"," It's gorgeous when you see stuff like this."
"10251140","10252980"," And then of course you have the one diplo."
"10253260","10254620"," You know what that means, right?"
"10255240","10258800"," When you're consolidating, you buy outside of the trading zone and boom. "
"10259480","10260480"," Fucking rocket ship."
"10260900","10262880"," That's what that buy came in right down here."
"10263200","10263880"," It's fucking gorgeous. "
"10265160","10268160"," Um, it's fucking beautiful."
"10268780","10270300"," This is like a perfect setup right here."
"10273100","10276620"," And then you've got, you know, the sellers here, right?"
"10276620","10280900"," Somewhere in there is a trap, trap buyers up in here. "
"10282140","10283800"," So you're going to wear these guys out next."
"10284860","10286700"," So you're going to look for the same thing."
"10288800","10297060"," You're going to look for any opportunity in here that trades below and boom, you're going to buy it"
"10297060","10297780"," to get up here. "
"10298380","10300480"," Now you might not, you might not wear out these sellers."
"10300740","10302200"," These sellers, there's a bunch back in here."
"10303280","10306100"," Um, but this is anything in here is a buy. "
"10307980","10309060"," This is that alert here."
"10309200","10309540"," This is good."
"10309680","10310660"," I like this trade, man. "
"10311420","10312060"," It's a good trade."
"10312880","10313640"," I like this trade."
"10313880","10314600"," I like this Dell trade. "
"10315680","10320340"," Set an alert at 48, 17, anything below."
"10320940","10323440"," You've got a lot of consolidation here."
"10323520","10324240"," This is good to see. "
"10325080","10325460"," I like this."
"10326720","10327520"," Good job, Linkie."
"10329900","10331280"," We'll look up Dell real quick. "
"10336040","10338560"," That's a shit ton of consolidation, Linkie."
"10343850","10345450"," Could you have a look at USO, please?"
"10346330","10348090"," Yeah, look at what USO shop."
"10349950","10352590"," Amazonia are coming up, maybe put time, yep. "
"10355550","10360990"," Yes, I know that about, uh, we can talk at some point about why don't trade SPX or yes."
"10360990","10363310"," Uh, typically I like to sleep."
"10364830","10366810"," I used to trade futures and Globex. "
"10366970","10367470"," I don't do anymore."
"10370730","10372690"," Yeah, you see Twitter printed today, right?"
"10373170","10375010"," That Twitter buy yesterday printed today."
"10376350","10377170"," Like normal. "
"10377690","10379210"," I'm trying to get through everything you guys are asking."
"10380910","10382290"," I'm sure this fucking Dell."
"10383370","10385070"," But yeah, you're just set it to, right?"
"10386150","10387330"," Just set it to you, right?"
"10388870","10393810"," Down here, look for a buy at four below four eight two zero, look for a buy. "
"10396650","10399030"," So this is where I'd be looking for a buy right down here."
"10399970","10402270"," So if you're short right now, where are you short to?"
"10403590","10406830"," I'd be fucking out of, I should, I said four eight two zero zero, it's probably right here."
"10408430","10412350"," I would only be short to four eight two, four eight one two, because there's gonna be fucking"
"10412350","10413930"," buyers just lining up right here. "
"10415450","10416690"," Right there buyers."
"10417670","10418070"," Waiting."
"10420130","10421710"," They can be short, you can be short here. "
"10422570","10424910"," Uh, but this is gonna trigger a buy signal right here."
"10424990","10425550"," I guarantee it."
"10429850","10430970"," Garen fucking teed. "
"10435690","10440130"," So we'll look down there at four two, we'll look at four two, we'll look at four eight two and"
"10440130","10441130"," see if his buyer's there."
"10441930","10442810"," Huge sellers here."
"10442890","10444670"," Look at that monster sellers, fucking. "
"10447150","10449150"," And we'll look to see where the buyers are."
"10451110","10455730"," Well, we will have a, this is not, this, this, uh, this stock doesn't have a lot of attraction"
"10455730","10456110"," here."
"10457270","10461350"," 29,000, this is a highly manipulatable stock, manipulatable stock. "
"10462710","10465630"," So I said look for buyers at forty eight twelve, right?"
"10468750","10471150"," And there's huge dollars above there, right?"
"10473510","10476150"," That was close."
"10477610","10478630"," Forty eight twenty."
"10481350","10484670"," So don't fucking short it past forty eight twenty, okay?"
"10487410","10488670"," No, don't close it out. "
"10489290","10491970"," Hold that fucking short down to fucking forty eight twenty."
"10495110","10496570"," Fucking short is fucking money."
"10499070","10500790"," You got a little ways to go here. "
"10501370","10505030"," You got some buyers here, but fucking supports forty eight twenty."
"10505990","10507190"," Diamond hands, baby."
"10508210","10509410"," Diamonds there, girl's best friend. "
"10512590","10514130"," Ooh, real support's even lower."
"10515310","10517010"," If you really wanted to diamond hand that shit."
"10518810","10523150"," Or if you really want to be a big buyer, forty seven dollars on Dell. "
"10527030","10527730"," Hold on here."
"10530040","10531040"," You guys are fucking hilarious."
"10531040","10531940"," I love all you guys. "
"10535490","10538330"," Spy sawing off along with the cues I'm assuming."
"10545320","10546420"," Fucking love my life."
"10547660","10549240"," My wife fucking hates me. "
"10550980","10552660"," It's like, what are you doing all day long?"
"10553040","10554600"," It's like you're supposed to be fucking trading."
"10555400","10557940"," Oh my God, I'm fucking around with people I know on the internet."
"10558100","10558820"," I've never met before. "
"10565940","10568260"," It's looking at that nice little roll coming up here."
"10569380","10570500"," We saw that."
"10571200","10572980"," We saw that the end. "
"10573160","10576100"," We'll look at NDX here in a minute."
"10578870","10581170"," Seeing that nice little roll coming over here, right?"
"10581170","10582290"," Sellers coming into play."
"10582550","10583990"," We're going to see if this can hold. "
"10584150","10595110"," This will probably match up with NDX at"
"10595110","10595570"," some point."
"10596350","10599770"," We'll track this as we get close to this vault trigger too."
"10600530","10604070"," And we'll try to match up the cues or NDX to 440. "
"10604470","10607830"," We'll see if this match is actually in hold."
"10608190","10616210"," I don't know if this will have to have to compare it to the chart up of NDX and the"
"10616210","10624310"," spy, I guess, and see if they kind of make where do they kind of tag up together."
"10624990","10626270"," I'll look right now at another chart. "
"10627410","10632770"," We'll see if we can get some bounce edge to keep this bowl trade alive or not."
"10635350","10639530"," Or if you break through the bears want, you know, the bears do the only waivers want it to break."
"10639930","10640830"," I promised that. "
"10642690","10650820"," So I'm going to look on trading view real quick and see if we can compare the two side by"
"10650820","10651300"," side."
"10657090","10662350"," And then we'll compare to..."
"10694310","10695930"," Okay, look at NDX real quick."
"10698910","10702610"," Yeah, I'm thinking that 13, 7, 8, 8 are right around there. "
"10703010","10704710"," We'll see, uh, hold on here."
"10706350","10707770"," 18, 130."
"10713130","10714350"," 18, 130. "
"10720650","10730490"," Shit, I mean, that's if, if Nasdaq, if Nasdaq sells straight off down to, if Nasdaq"
"10730490","10741370"," sells off straight down to fucking, um, if Nas, if Nasdaq sells off down to retest 13, 7, 88, that"
"10741370","10742610"," fucking puts us."
"10745210","10752250"," So I see some American railroads we play real quick report for the beginning April 16th sends total"
"10752250","10756670"," units down to 0.1% intermodal traffic down 9.2% here."
"10757310","10758710"," Yeah, I think, uh, 231. "
"10758910","10761190"," Yeah, that puts us down to like 438 on the spy."
"10761470","10768900"," That puts us fucking down, down here on the fucking spy for the day."
"10769400","10770300"," That'd be fucking wild. "
"10771580","10779200"," So if, if Nasdaq sells off, and if sometimes that spy will hold, like they'll hold 440 in Nasdaq,"
"10779400","10780880"," you'll have larger swings, right?"
"10781080","10786700"," And in, in right now you'll have larger swings in, um, Nasdaq, then you will in the spy."
"10788440","10795900"," Um, maybe spy would tap 440 and then you'd see Nasdaq, uh, trade all the way down to that 13,"
"10796020","10798900"," 70, whatever it is, 13, 7, 8 or something."
"10798900","10808740"," Um, and we've got some bears coming up here for, we've got some bears coming up here for,"
"10808740","10812130"," um, fed speakers. "
"10817110","10818130"," Enter day, right?"
"10818650","10819950"," Sell it, buy it, sell it."
"10820650","10823170"," Buy it, not really working right now on the buy it."
"10824410","10826990"," Oh, we've got fed speakers coming up between now and 1 o'clock. "
"10828870","10831010"," We also have a VIX OPEX."
"10831450","10836130"," So we know as the day moves on and, uh, VIX puts are monetizing."
"10836670","10841670"," Uh, and if we don't see a bid in the market, that we should trade down to the close to"
"10841670","10841990"," 440. "
"10842850","10846050"," It will be a quick run quote unquote down to 440."
"10847610","10849590"," So that can happen into the end of the day as well."
"10850170","10852890"," Couple that with some, uh, bear fed speakers into the bell. "
"10853370","10860570"," And maybe it's some, maybe some fear and, and not, or fear and tech earnings at the end of the"
"10860570","10862130"," day, like, uh, IE Tesla."
"10874390","10875310"," Hang tight here."
"10877290","10880930"," You've got, um, we've got both stick at one. "
"10881350","10886810"," It's already 12.23. We got the Bayes Book at two."
"10887310","10888270"," There's your second volatility."
"10891430","10893430"," And then you've got the VIX. "
"10894450","10897510"," Just spiking off 1975 right now currently."
"10898070","10903810"," So if you're not inputs right now, I'm going to tell you that there's a fair chance that you're"
"10903810","10908390"," going to see weakness in the market, um, at this point where we are right now."
"10911030","10912570"," And that's what I'm telling you. "
"10912830","10914310"," Give me that fucking roll over."
"10925290","10926230"," Fidelity sucks."
"10932330","10935310"," Oh, yeah, let's see it roll over, baby. "
"10936010","10937690"," Let's see that roll over in the spy."
"10938710","10940290"," Let's get our bear suits on."
"10941270","10942470"," You feeling it?"
"10942710","10944330"," Oh, there it is. "
"10945170","10947550"," There isn't waiting for this for two days now."
"10948510","10951310"," Just fucking foaming at the fucking miles."
"10952190","10954610"," Fucking bulls taking two fucking days. "
"10956890","10958090"," Getting bearish here."
"10968570","10970730"," Getting fucking bearish."
"10972110","10973430"," Can you taste it?"
"10973850","10975230"," You all you bears taste it?"
"10976090","10978590"," Get on Twitter and start telling your beer friends. "
"10983670","10984650"," There we go."
"10984650","10987970"," That little salt, that little salt came into the market up here."
"10989750","10991250"," Bears can taste it. "
"10991470","10993270"," It's like salty honey."
"10994190","10996510"," It's like pouring out of the side of the stump."
"11002340","11005780"," Fucking bears are just fucking foaming at the mounds right now. "
"11006480","11007680"," I'm going to post something on Twitter."

"12684910","12690530"," A little bit of sellers here, 447 and then 447 8 0 same place as before."
"12704680","12705880"," So savage."
"12716990","12718370"," I cut yet. "
"12718650","12719070"," Yeah, I cut."
"12719550","12720170"," Foolish to try."
"12720630","12721270"," Foolish. "
"12723190","12730850"," You guys are saying here."
"12736850","12738890"," You can't really cancel dip buyers."
"12744200","12746640"," It's a pretty pretty good trading day though so far. "
"12746720","12747300"," This is good money."
"12748120","12749900"," You get nice trades up and down."
"12750640","12754360"," We'll look for another another position here as we head into the two o'clock hour. "
"12762710","12763390"," You've got."
"12769720","12772000"," You've seen these AAL puts all day long."
"12772620","12776940"," We're going to look at AAL real quick and we're going to bring AAL up. "
"12791070","12793850"," Watching repetitive puts on American Airlines."
"12795570","12797190"," It's a pretty big trade right?"
"12797490","12801470"," 1245 to 2007 American Airlines."
"12802870","12805610"," Keep seeing puts on American Airlines. "
"12805610","12814250"," I don't know if."
"12814750","12815550"," Hey buddy."
"12816290","12817350"," How are you doing?"
"12817470","12818170"," You coming to say hello?"
"12819990","12821170"," Hey, it's a boy. "
"12822810","12823630"," Good boy."
"12829750","12830890"," Do you want to hop down?"
"12833750","12840630"," More sellers than buyers currently on on American Airlines."
"12845790","12856290"," It's watching"
"12856290","12860970"," some roll over in the options on American Airlines. "
"12871020","12872200"," Pretty significant."
"12872380","12874180"," Sellers on 25."
"12880120","12882080"," Price started down below 1835. "
"12882460","12886800"," The puts are 18Ps for May 27th."
"12886800","12887880"," They've been coming in all morning."
"12891750","12893890"," Seems like firm support down there at 18. "
"12899750","12908260"," It's a pretty pretty big trend down there."
"12911950","12913370"," On the reopening trade."
"12914050","12916810"," So it doesn't necessarily look over bearish or anything. "
"12920670","12923250"," There's 18 down here."
"12923830","12925710"," So I guess they're counting that right there."
"12926650","12932090"," The plan of those puts is to take this down here to 1818 bucks. "
"12934870","12936870"," And the date they have on them."
"12940640","12943160"," The date of those puts are 527."
"12943960","12945020"," It's a pretty pretty time. "
"12947640","12948520"," It's not a bad trade."
"12957310","12964010"," If you've been looking at that trade, you might not want to enter it until 21."
"12964770","12971510"," So keep your eye on that trade. "
"12972930","12978130"," And if you see that it's still on and if we trade to $21, it could be a good trade."
"12979690","12982830"," So if you trade at 21 bucks, you'd look to see if they're still in those puts."
"12984230","12987970"," And then you could take that trade down to 18. "
"12996530","12997310"," That one over."
"12997970","12999730"," Get rid of American Airlines."
"13006310","13007550"," Let's see what's going on here. "
"13019410","13022770"," There's our like fuck no get back down there."
"13024390","13025830"," Get back down there."
"13025970","13028510"," You've got dang where you've got dang bulls. "
"13032010","13032550"," Sorry."
"13037570","13038270"," All right."
"13038390","13039030"," Let's take a quick break. "
"13040630","13041850"," I will be back."
"13042050","13046350"," It's one it's one p.m. You're going to hear Bostick speaking on trade the news or quotes from"
"13046350","13048470"," Bostick on trade the news."
"13049490","13054710"," I do want you to be aware that there are about 210,000 puts on 47 cents. "
"13055610","13063370"," And then also be aware that Spock Emma is still calling for a price target of 440 at some point"
"13063370","13063810"," today."
"13063950","13067590"," We're going to get a little sleep surgery, 16 million dollar 20-year bond reopening."
"13082050","13090610"," But I tell you what if that if that if there was a ceasefire on the court retrain shoot, I"
"13090610","13098160"," should probably keep up like a I should probably keep a screener up of Oh, wait a minute. "
"13098200","13099400"," Does someone want to ask you guys yesterday?"
"13100620","13106160"," So yesterday my question to you are for me to ask you guys this question the past couple days."
"13106320","13110000"," If you could put I have I put a screener up with Twitter."
"13110520","13112240"," I haven't been paying much attention to it recently. "
"13112680","13114000"," I was going to try to."
"13117540","13123820"," But I was I was going to ask you guys if you had two recommendations for Twitter follows during the"
"13123820","13129320"," daytime, who would it be if you were to have two pick or pick one."
"13129740","13131860"," You guys pick your favorite Twitter follower. "
"13132440","13134360"," Who would you follow for updates on Twitter?"
"13135740","13136480"," And I'll throw two."
"13136620","13141800"," I'll throw those two people up here so I can watch them all through all day long."
"13141800","13146060"," I feel like two favorite follows during market hours. "
"13147640","13150620"," Who would they be because they've got two open spaces."
"13153000","13160220"," And I remember yesterday, I was going to put always up yesterday and I guess he closed this or I"
"13160220","13165960"," don't know if he deleted his account, but he's he's not on Twitter right now."
"13166340","13167460"," But I was going to put him up yesterday. "
"13169900","13172640"," Watching calls on Facebook, spy and Netflix."
"13176490","13179630"," So let me know in the chat who you think we see."
"13183270","13186550"," So the speech I'm not by couldn't find it. "
"13190690","13193410"," Kevin Rojas wouldn't continue doing that."
"13194450","13197030"," I don't know who at Kevin Rojas is."
"13205900","13207100"," Horse and Derek. "
"13216450","13222150"," Continue opening, drawing three spot zero, nine to five percent."
"13222350","13225010"," Fifty five point nine percent behind the cover."
"13225230","13229190"," A bunch who you have five and zero in strikes at 75.9 percent. "
"13229350","13229390"," Right."
"13229570","13230890"," But at 15.3 percent."
"13231190","13231530"," Stay in the follow. "
"13231770","13233530"," I guess got a bunch of motherfuckers in here."
"13234070","13235290"," Who is uh."
"13236770","13237970"," Who's Kevin Rojas?"
"13243160","13244860"," I missed all that, whatever that was. "
"13245200","13246920"," I thought Kevin Rojas was a follow on Twitter."
"13252310","13257630"," Longer dated, treasuries moving at, Jersey yields moving at the fresh lows after the 20 year."
"13257890","13259170"," Had a meal sitting here, follow him. "
"13260350","13262090"," I follow Adam and see you like him."
"13264190","13266610"," Photo, Aaron Rentview, don't know who he is."
"13267470","13267970"," I'll look him up. "
"13272290","13273330"," I'll leave him Gallagher."
"13273650","13274770"," I don't know if I follow him."
"13274950","13275410"," Sounds familiar. "
"13280370","13282530"," Oh, thanks for the cat captain James."
"13284110","13285930"," Mayhem, I thought were from friends with him."
"13286390","13286950"," I like J."
"13287030","13287290"," Stris. "
"13287530","13287910"," He's an asshole."
"13289570","13291530"," I like that he's like that though."
"13291970","13293050"," I love J."
"13293130","13293450"," Stris. "
"13294670","13296530"," Yoda flow, don't know who that is."
"13298210","13299570"," More like people I don't know."
"13301090","13304310"," Uh, check he show 25. "
"13308810","13310030"," No idea who that is."
"13311930","13313390"," Yeah, I'm friends with Quinn too."
"13313630","13315090"," I gotta talk to him by the way. "
"13315930","13317010"," I'm friends with Baba Yaga."
"13317230","13317810"," He's fucking dope."
"13318810","13320190"," Uh, Tommy Thornton. "
"13322450","13323350"," Tommy Thornton."
"13328520","13329040"," Uh."
"13339020","13339960"," I love J."
"13340040","13340300"," Stris. "
"13340920","13341920"," Fucking guys, fucking hilarious."
"13348370","13349090"," Kevin Rojas."
"13349310","13349970"," Are you on Twitter?"
"13350190","13351190"," What's your Twitter handle?"
"13353510","13355550"," Wifey Al, but I checked him out recently. "
"13355830","13356230"," I like him."
"13358370","13360230"," I didn't know who he was, but now I do."
"13360750","13361250"," Yoda flow. "
"13361530","13362150"," I think I got him."
"13362270","13363010"," I got Yoda flow down."
"13367630","13368790"," Is it a bear trap?"
"13369090","13369390"," I don't know. "
"13369550","13370190"," I wasn't paying attention."
"13372310","13373450"," Is it a bear trap?"
"13378180","13378660"," I'm unsure."
"13378840","13381400"," I'd really like to hear what Bostik is saying right now. "
"13381400","13387220"," We've got Beige Book at 2PM, which is kind of like the golden book for everybody, right?"
"13387640","13388720"," Everybody likes the Beige Book."
"13390220","13393020"," We're still just kind of range bound at this point, right?"
"13393240","13393900"," We're still in this range."
"13394900","13395680"," One, two, three, four. "
"13399060","13400120"," I don't know what to say."
"13400200","13401080"," I was going to think I'm a quick break."
"13401180","13402380"," It seems like it's the middle of the afternoon. "
"13402540","13404280"," It's 105 in the afternoon."
"13405000","13407340"," The flow is slowing down considerably."
"13409640","13411520"," I'm watching, I'm watching flow come in. "
"13411520","13413940"," It's very small and very slow."
"13415580","13418020"," Not rapid fire like it was earlier."
"13419220","13421680"," Let me reset this one thing here. "
"13432710","13434070"," Yeah, this has really changed."
"13438730","13441210"," My take is still the same, right?"
"13441610","13442710"," Or my take is still the same."
"13442970","13446110"," So I've got put, still puts for Friday. "
"13446950","13447950"," Well protected."
"13447950","13450010"," I've got puts for today that aren't printing at all."
"13450370","13451110"," I don't think they're worth it. "
"13451190","13452950"," So I've got ones that I bought yesterday."
"13454470","13460990"," Then I'm buying in and out of 4.45s. Yeah, and they're worth the ones from this."
"13461110","13466410"," I probably should have sold the ones from this morning because the market makers are not, they're"
"13466410","13466970"," just going to die. "
"13468610","13469850"," Hold on a second."
"13470010","13473190"," I should have just plucked and sold those and at least collected a dollar or something."
"13475350","13476970"," I didn't even do that. "
"13477010","13477390"," There they go."
"13480430","13481330"," No, no, no, no."
"13481410","13482410"," Clear all this shit. "
"13483430","13486510"," I can think or swim dude sometime."
"13486970","13487710"," I think it's from tasty."
"13504880","13510580"," So the U.S. Treasury, 20-year bond, $16 billion. "
"13510900","13519860"," Roping draws 3.09% versus 2.65, 1% prior, but to cover 2.80 versus 2.72 prior."
"13520800","13523000"," And 2.44 over last eight re-openings."
"13529050","13530650"," Take a look at the shy real quick on that. "
"13532950","13533950"," Not much reaction."
"13535570","13536610"," That's all."
"13538770","13539990"," Now that down there. "
"13541190","13542230"," 81-46."
"13545710","13547630"," Now, so I think it still stands, right?"
"13547790","13557670"," I think you're looking for grinding and then I'm going to give it, I'm going to give at least"
"13557670","13558970"," some options to this."
"13559130","13562030"," I've got some nice puts going down here into Friday. "
"13562830","13564990"," Still have Friday puts for down below here."
"13566030","13572690"," So if I can grab some, if I can grab some long calls here for the next nine days above,"
"13573250","13575290"," believe it or not, way up here."
"13575430","13581910"," I'm going to grab some 450s, 460s and some 470s up here and add them to the bin. "
"13586030","13588730"," And one side should print at some point."
"13588950","13596810"," Now, in terms of day trading, it looks like you get dip buys down here and sells above and you"
"13596810","13598390"," just hold them until they print, right?"
"13601690","13603130"," So that's the plan."
"13603450","13606410"," We'll look at NDX real quick and see if we're getting that same rollover. "
"13607730","13611130"," And the other point to make would be you're seeing that right."
"13611310","13615730"," We do each side talk about this is rejection up here and you're getting some of that right now in"
"13615730","13616250"," NDX."
"13616890","13624470"," And then the other idea being that once for our Spock Amazon point is that if they, if the holders"
"13624470","13630570"," of those VIX puts into expiration are monetized, that you will see a quick trip down below to 440"
"13630570","13631530"," at some point today. "
"13632850","13637870"," So if I can get that 440, I'm going to try to pick up some of those penny calls on"
"13637870","13638270"," the market."
"13641010","13642390"," Which is not happening yet."
"13642390","13643930"," And I couldn't end up missing it, right?"
"13643990","13645290"," I probably should have bottomed down here. "
"13648870","13650650"," We'll take a look at Tesla real quick too."
"13650950","13651910"," Tesla's down $43."
"13653010","13659190"," Couldn't even make it up to 10.29. They're just bouncing down below here now at 9.78. It kind"
"13659190","13660010"," of sucks on Tesla. "
"13663450","13665650"," And it's looking quite weak right now as well, right?"
"13665790","13669590"," If you're looking at any kind of time frame, we'll take a look at Tesla before I take a break."
"13669590","13673930"," Because you can see intraday at least that you would want to buy any of these."
"13674590","13674990"," Here. "
"13678250","13681610"," There's a good buy down here, at least intraday down in this zone."
"13681790","13683810"," Even right now, this is a pretty decent buy on Tesla."
"13686110","13689450"," You know, the fucking Netflix thing is brutal. "
"13693100","13702180"," Because it does bring up the question of it does bring up the question of is Shanghai in sales of"
"13702180","13703940"," Teslas in China and Russia?"
"13704540","13706940"," And then threat of continued war and shortages."
"13707640","13711360"," Does that make its way and poison the guidance at all?"
"13712320","13717080"," Because you know what, I mean, I love Tesla, but you do realize that people have teletruth."
"13717740","13727610"," So you can't not tell the truth in ER statements. "
"13729370","13732970"," So there will have to at least acknowledge that possibility."
"13739540","13743640"," Netflix poison, I mean, do you think they're leaving fucking the Twitter dales poison fucking"
"13743640","13747880"," goddamn Netflix poison the well, even if it's a good ER."
"13750500","13752020"," It's a good place to buy though. "
"13752440","13754780"," This is a trigger buy for a day traded by a bottom here."
"13755140","13757620"," So we'll see what happens here."
"13758840","13761520"," See if this catches a bit of the close down here on Tesla. "
"13761760","13766260"," We'll take a look at it real quick for it to break and see if Tesla can catch a bounce"
"13766260","13766600"," here."
"13768700","13770740"," And for their ER for after hours."
"13770940","13772600"," Let me let me know in the chat what you think. "
"13773260","13778820"," But just real quick in the chat to say good, bad or neutral ER."
"13780780","13781960"," Or forget that."
"13783240","13784440"," We have to get that question. "
"13785660","13787840"," I don't care what the ER is or guidance is."
"13788120","13794540"," You tell them because what matters in the day is not it's not a good ER."
"13794540","13796120"," We have some decent support down here. "
"13796240","13796620"," Nice little bounce."
"13797800","13798580"," I like it."
"13802970","13803510"," Let me know. "
"13805010","13806550"," It's a nice little trade right here, probably."
"13808610","13811150"," You'll have those buyers down there, at least for a day trade."
"13816970","13822430"," Yeah, 10.30 still above 10.05, 10.30. We'll let this play out here for a minute. "
"13823590","13825810"," Nice little fucking bounce down below here on Tesla."
"13832440","13834940"," Big support down here, even if it's only per minute."
"13837780","13843000"," If this area breaks down here, it looks like there's some some more support down below here at 9 "
"13843000","13849230",".74. But if that breaks, man, 9.50, baby. "
"13850490","13852970"," I'm going to show this to you right now in the charts, okay?"
"13855110","13856750"," And this is that zone right here."
"13857110","13861310"," If that breaks, you're 9.50. I don't know if you get, I'm not, I'm sorry, I'm not going to"
"13861310","13862730"," say we're going to 9.50 right now."
"13863610","13866490"," There is another little area to be concerned about up here. "
"13867230","13874850"," Right at 9.95, some traffic, and then again at up here at 10.30. It's a nice little day"
"13874850","13875330"," trade right here."
"13876010","13876810"," I like this day trade."
"13878750","13880190"," I fucking like this day trade. "
"13880370","13881010"," It's a nice day trade."
"13882650","13887090"," 1,000 meters zone of contention, and then above here at Rip here."
"13888710","13892930"," Some zones to be aware of right here, and again right here. "
"13893990","13896490"," A tough man."
"13896610","13899150"," If this sells off down to fucking 9.50, it's going to suck."
"13899330","13899930"," Let me know in the chat. "
"13900830","13901970"," Forget what the guidance is."
"13902250","13902730"," Forget all that stuff."
"13902890","13903490"," This is what I want to know. "
"13905130","13907630"," I want to know, does Tesla rip?"
"13911730","13915390"," Does Tesla rip in after hours, or does it sell off in after hours?"
"13915610","13916610"," Just that rip or sell off?"
"13918730","13919390"," That's what I want to know."
"13924070","13925390"," The shenanigans will be."
"13930360","13933860"," Or there's a Jenssen or someone in there earlier. "
"13934620","13936460"," Pretty much has my take on it."
"13937100","13940220"," He said the last seven to the last seven."
"13945060","13950740"," Fucking a Yee-ha, baby Yee-ha. "
"13960430","13962470"," So Rip sell."
"13963890","13965030"," Tesla dumps sell."
"13965310","13965790"," Rip sell. "
"13965930","13968790"," Even pre-50-50, you guys are your thoughts."
"13968790","13971270"," What's the history of the guilt that's after your year?"
"13974710","13975670"," Bradbot puts."
"13980980","13985940"," T.L.T. is fucking ripping right now. "
"13986740","13987420"," It's fucking awesome."
"13987760","13988640"," Look at that beautiful thing."
"13989860","13990500"," Gorgeous. "
"13994450","13995150"," Fucking gorgeous."
"13996790","14001240"," Look at T.L.T. Rarely scooped right up."
"14004400","14005620"," Fucking killer. "
"14007020","14009180"," Congrats to T.L.T. bulls."
"14031740","14043740"," Boy, this looks really, really, um, this looks really, um, bullish."
"14045980","14047300"," Too pretty bullish, isn't it?"
"14050360","14053280"," Heh, here's getting fucking annihilated in here. "
"14072030","14073590"," T.L.T. fucking moving."
"14074790","14084650"," 121.66. Nice beautiful bounce down"
"14084650","14085310"," here on Tesla."
"14085890","14087130"," We'll see if we can maintain or hold it. "
"14089630","14092710"," I did suck to see Tesla trade down."
"14096850","14099250"," Hey, when I see Tesla trade below, it's range."
"14101210","14102110"," It makes me sad. "
"14116440","14119100"," Yeah, T.L.T. it looks bullish just fuck right now."
"14119320","14120440"," Spy looks really good right now."
"14123260","14125480"," Oh shit, some weirdness going on over there in Tesla. "
"14126580","14128000"," Tesla's getting funky right now."
"14130430","14132790"," Hope the fuck it doesn't red bar some depths of hell."
"14135070","14136390"," It's looking salty right now. "
"14136530","14138990"," Tesla's doing the weird, doing hit the weird shake right now."
"14140110","14145770"," It's like a bloodbath out of nowhere."
"14158460","14160520"," So we'll look here and see what's going on. "
"14170620","14172600"," Nice action on the spy right now."
"14184510","14185690"," Time is 118."
"14232260","14232940"," That's delivery. "
"14233640","14237380"," Repo operation 93 kind of earnings taking 1.87 trillion dollars."
"14239480","14241680"," We had some quick money right there on some puts."
"14256830","14258010"," Hmm, that's good. "
"14258130","14259130"," That's a good trade right now."
"14265340","14291500"," Come on,"
"14291520","14291980"," sell down."
"14294810","14295950"," Keep fucking selling. "
"14296510","14318570"," Oh yeah,"
"14318730","14319510"," baby, keep selling."
"14338490","14340170"," I grabbed some at 40 cents."
"14340430","14342270"," They're like 46, 47 cents. "
"14342390","14344790"," They're direct down to 45 cents now, 42 cents."
"14345790","14347490"," They're not giving the fucking payout on it."
"14349170","14350130"," These motherfuckers. "
"14361230","14362830"," There's so many puts out there."
"14362930","14364050"," It's like they don't want to print them."
"14370270","14371310"," So it feels like. "
"14376980","14377960"," Come on, breakthrough."
"14416980","14417960"," It's not going to happen."
"14442580","14452960"," I'm going"
"14452960","14453420"," to take a piss. "
"14453720","14454160"," I'll be right back."
"14454440","14455580"," Give me like 15 minutes."
"14455680","14456100"," I'll be right back. "
"14456180","14456740"," I'm going to go take a piss."
"14462690","14465810"," More more dip fires stepping in here on Vwap on the spy."
"14468530","14469310"," Oh, I got to take a piss. "
"14469690","14470050"," I'm right back."
"14470210","14470370"," Hold on."
"14843760","14844820"," All right, bear with me here. "
"14844900","14846940"," I'm going to chew it on some."
"14850140","14853840"," I've got some chocolate and peanut candies."
"14855800","14856840"," I'm chopping on. "
"14859600","14861960"," And I'm pouring myself a drink here."
"14862140","14864580"," So I'm on some puts right now."
"14866260","14871480"," I could these could burn too, but I want to see if this can get a roll over. "
"14871580","14872520"," And I doubt that it does."
"14874260","14877160"," But I am looking for a roll in the market into the clothes."
"14878800","14885360"," I don't know that it's doom and gloom for the bowls at that point, but I am looking for some"
"14885360","14886660"," kind of a roll at that. "
"14886940","14891020"," I know Spock Emmett can get some stuff wrong, or they give you two sides of an argument."
"14892160","14895740"," So you have to take your own risk into what you think that side of the argument is."
"14896040","14899180"," I want to buy long here, but I don't want to buy it right here. "
"14899500","14901660"," I really do want to buy it down below it like 440."
"14903040","14909660"," I don't know if I get that chance today to buy some calls down here."
"14911140","14914720"," So I want to see if this if this roll actually takes place into the clothes. "
"14914720","14917420"," Of course, it always goes the opposite way of where you think it's going to go."
"14919060","14924840"," But that's the that's the exposition is that we're going to get down into here towards the clothes."
"14925860","14926940"," So I'm going to take a quick break. "
"14927180","14932560"," I'm going to stand a break real quick and just and eat this food that I got to eat."
"14932580","14935760"," And then I'm going to put a whiskey too."
"14935840","14939400"," So I will see how this plays itself. "
"14939400","14940740"," Out into the bell."
"14941360","14942440"," I still am."
"14942640","14944340"," We're still above the trigger level. "
"14944580","14947280"," So overall, it's still a bullish context to the market."
"14948480","14951440"," You can see right now that there's a lot going on."
"14951820","14953660"," Some rotation going on right now. "
"14954020","14956700"," Got more call buyers than sellers right now too."
"14956760","14957720"," You can see right here, right?"
"14958080","14962840"," 24,000 calls to 12,000 puts right now."
"14963480","14967160"," So the bet is on the bull side of things, at least for the moment. "
"14968220","14970800"," The liquidity is on the bull's side right now."
"14973180","14975020"," So we can match this up a little bit better."
"14975560","14978460"," 22,000 puts up here, 30,000 calls right here. "
"14980360","14983640"," The heroin indicator is green right now, very green right now."
"14983840","14986160"," So the indicator is that we're going up here."
"14987940","14988840"," I'll pull them. "
"14988900","14991200"," I'll pull them loose anywhere above 448."
"14992800","14994900"," But anything up in here, I'm going to grab."
"14995200","14998860"," I'm going to keep grabbing some some puts up in here into the bell. "
"14999220","15003100"," So until I see any kind of movement up here."
"15005660","15007180"," Matter of fact, this one right here."
"15008960","15011160"," Try to get this to short down into the bell. "
"15011820","15012980"," I'm trusting them today."
"15013080","15016740"," I hope that I can trust them today that they will sell off into this bell."
"15017040","15018560"," I'm not sure that's going to happen though. "
"15018680","15020860"," It does look like we're bullish at this point."
"15021540","15025820"," The one thing you could give to the bears right now is that we are bottoming and consolidating at"
"15025820","15026260"," some point."
"15027980","15031080"," On the VIX, the VIX is bottoming down in 1975. "
"15032760","15035160"," That is one for the bears."
"15037980","15043260"," As you move forward, if you look at the VIX right now, the VIX is telling you a different story"
"15043260","15044600"," than where the market should go."
"15045320","15046920"," We all know the VIX can roll over though. "
"15052830","15057870"," So we do have some kind of a bottoming pattern down here in the VIX."
"15058710","15059490"," Get it here."
"15064890","15066210"," Today I'm bringing the VIX for you. "
"15070040","15072100"," Unless there's some kind of news we don't know about."
"15082010","15083630"," Nice little trading pattern here."
"15084050","15086170"," Broke down below this trading pattern. "
"15086830","15087930"," How low can we go?"
"15088190","15090610"," We were just down at 1845 recently, right?"
"15091730","15092830"," On the 5th."
"15094090","15098650"," So it's not like you can't break below and trade down to 1850 on VIX expiration."
"15099130","15104570"," It's like it's not possible for the market to continue to go up today and then we have expiration. "
"15106450","15109390"," The question becomes, is this the bottom for the day?"
"15109610","15112790"," Do we trade higher or just trade sideways into the bell?"
"15113410","15114090"," That would be another question."
"15114310","15116870"," We trade sideways and then we fall off into the bell down here."
"15116930","15118550"," That would give you your rip into the clothes as well. "
"15121600","15123580"," So it's tough to say right here where we are."
"15124440","15128580"," But we do know that generally speaking, when we're down here, somewhere down in this vicinity, we"
"15128580","15129640"," tend to start to go up."
"15130360","15132380"," 1850 down here, 1850 down below. "
"15133300","15135180"," Now they can see somewhere down in here."
"15135280","15137380"," There should be some weakness to the market at some point."
"15191430","15192130"," Sorry, I'm chewing. "
"15195890","15196870"," One other note too."
"15197270","15200550"," When you have a trend day, this isn't the pattern of a trend day either, right?"
"15201810","15204150"," So it's trying to get higher, trying to get higher, trying to get higher."
"15207020","15211960"," This does also look like some consolidation for move higher, but it could be explosive move higher"
"15211960","15212380"," into the bell. "
"15213540","15219520"," Well, that certainly isn't a trend day moving up or trend day moving down either."
"15219780","15220740"," More like coiling."
"15309940","15318180"," Also had a pin strike right above here, 121.97. We showed this on the chart for the past few"
"15318180","15318360"," weeks. "
"15318560","15319640"," I think we're talking about this, right?"
"15322340","15327340"," So the rejection up here at 121.95. Next price target, I guess."
"15328560","15330840"," What price started here at 124.98?"
"15331080","15333640"," This is going back some time."
"15334340","15340440"," I think that I'm trying to see where, yeah, this is what's important, mostly about this, right?"
"15340820","15343260"," One, two, this became support. "
"15343560","15344460"," Now it's turning to resistance."
"15348160","15349520"," Same thing down below here."
"15356980","15357700"," Okay. "
"15357700","15358060"," Strike here."
"15361000","15362460"," So we'll continue to monitor."
"15364540","15366020"," It's going to be daily on this. "
"15372030","15375530"," 17 million or 17 million shares."
"15376850","15378230"," 26 sold."
"15378650","15380450"," Nice little fucking reversal candle here. "
"15384170","15386910"," 55 million low volume day, then this good."
"15393070","15394950"," It's a lot of gaps to fill in here."
"15395610","15396630"," It's like 140. "
"15406630","15410430"," Like seeing this buy down here as well."
"15412070","15412890"," Take a look."
"15413050","15419550"," I'll look at the options chain today and see how long people actually are in this trade. "
"15421870","15424290"," Let's see how far out their longs are."
"15435990","15563940"," I really"
"15563940","15566260"," aren't that many outside the money calls on TLT."
"15566360","15568740"," It's all 125 with a stuff that hasn't printed yet. "
"15568820","15570100"," It's all 125, 126."
"15571280","15576260"," Nothing crazy like 140s, 150s on TLT."
"15649660","15650320"," Yes. "
"15650620","15659340"," Treasury announcing new sanctions on the Russian commercial bank, Transcapitel bank, and on another"
"15659340","15660140"," Russian oligarch."
"16193970","16194490"," All right."
"16199380","16200020"," Okay. "
"16200120","16203900"," So we've got the beige book coming out at with nine minutes left."
"16207600","16210560"," We've got eight minutes until the beige book is released."
"16211820","16215000"," The beige book, it tends to be, let me see. "
"16218220","16227120"," This is what the Fed ends up facing all of their decisions on or discussions on, of course, in"
"16227120","16229080"," the FOMC meeting."
"16231500","16234160"," Most of the bad news is already out on the beige book."
"16234360","16237100"," I'm not expecting it to have too much of an impact. "
"16237300","16239420"," There should be some selling in the last few minutes."
"16239420","16245960"," We know that buying puts up here is paying off to an extent by calls down here is paying off"
"16245960","16246460"," to an extent."
"16248630","16253870"," So then we get some more weakness real quick into the beige book. "
"16253870","16255390"," Our next eight minutes, possibly."
"16256930","16260470"," And then I don't think it's going to be a non-event to this point."
"16260470","16262110"," I don't think that it's a huge event. "
"16262730","16264010"," So wait until it drops."
"16264270","16265810"," Maybe we can grab some calls if there's a chance."
"16274900","16280780"," Some calls coming in on rig 4.5c, 417,000 dollars. "
"16281960","16283400"," We'll take a look at rig real quick."
"16298960","16302240"," Those are right in the money to 4.5 right where they are."
"16302680","16303100"," I like that trade. "
"16304460","16307260"," We'll take a look at rig real quick and see what it's doing."
"16327520","16329380"," Some spy puts coming in right now."
"16329540","16331060"," QQQ's puts coming in right now. "
"16331320","16335340"," 420, 342p, a couple hundred thousand dollars."
"16335400","16338840"," A couple hundred thousand dollars on those spy puts to 420, 446p."
"16350080","16351500"," We'll let this load up on rig. "
"16370420","16385710"," Yeah, like"
"16385710","16388130"," I'm looking at January 26th on Tesla earnings."
"16388570","16394779"," They had a surprise beep plus seven percent still sold off."
"16395919","16397320"," I'm looking back on history. "
"16399020","16403960"," Dude, July 22nd of 2020 was fucking amazing."

"16412099","16413119"," Those are killer."
"16414680","16415800"," Some killer. "
"16421640","16428919"," I really had much of a red July of 2020 was good."
"16429580","16431680"," I think we ran it up into that one though."
"16431759","16441669"," I can't remember or recall, but we've had four green quarters on Tesla, which is pretty fucking"
"16441669","16442150"," solid. "
"16449720","16454279"," The question becomes it's not really fudged, but the question becomes it's just kind of neutral."
"16470390","16471630"," So you guys are doing there, bro."
"16471730","16473650"," I come who brought that shark tank guys stuck. "
"16474009","16475070"," I don't know about that one."

"16491810","16494470"," I'm not looking to buy spy calls unless I can."
"16494590","16495029"," I'm hoping."
"16496230","16502130"," My hope is that my hope is that we get down. "
"16502130","16503490"," I want to see us get down here."
"16503490","16503990"," I want to see."
"16506189","16507869"," I want to see us get down here. "
"16508110","16510150"," Like I really want to I haven't bought shit yet."

"16567050","16567650"," It might be."
"16576310","16582189"," I'll tell you what if the market doesn't sell off into the bell, we have these 246,000 puts."
"16582450","16583110"," Don't fucking print. "
"16584070","16586630"," This now is 246,000 or 445."
"16586830","16589950"," They don't print this fucking shit could rocket ship at the end of the day."
"16620400","16621980"," Or there's just a pin there at 445. "

"16716210","16722550"," Economic activity expanded at a moderate pace since mid-February since Beige book outlook for"

"16730669","16732390"," Yeah, fuck that's fucking middle."
"16732390","16735570"," Beige book prepared by the Minneapolis Fed. "
"16739419","16743099"," The information was collected on her before April 11th for this beige book."
"16746430","16747330"," It's kind of middle of the road."
"16747450","16752610"," It's not really, it's not really shitty or good, is it?"
"16755900","16759860"," Beige book seeing labor market, employment increase at a moderate pace. "
"16761439","16763419"," The demand for workers continued to be strong."

"16824720","16829720"," Merciful real estate activity accelerated modestly as office occupancy and retail activity"
"16829720","16830380"," increased."
"16833500","16837760"," Consumer spending accelerating among the retail and non-financial service firms. "
"16841240","16842720"," That's somewhat positive."
"16850550","16853350"," It's good to see retail sales accelerating."
"16854130","16859670"," There was concern that retail sales are going down to inflation. "
"16862030","16865230"," It's kind of a mixed bag to take a look at this."
"16865890","16871630"," So the headline for the beige book is inflationary pressures remained strong since prior report."
"16872210","16877010"," Firms have continued to pass swiftly rising input cost through to customers. "
"16884360","16888780"," Overall, economic activity expanded at a moderate pace since mid-February."

"16914840","16921160"," But supply chain backlogs, labor market tightness, elevated input costs, continued to post"

"16926060","16930060"," Vehicle sales remained largely constrained by low inventories. "
"16930420","16935460"," Commercial real estate activity accelerated modestly as office occupancy and retail activity"
"16935460","16935900"," increased."
"16936780","16940660"," So you might see some bumps in commercial real estate."
"16943120","16949720"," Districts contacts reported continued strong demand for residential real estate, but limited"
"16949720","16950180"," supply. "
"16950600","16952540"," So there's still a squeeze on housing."
"16952960","16955600"," So retail reels to reach should do well still."
"16956480","16959280"," Agricultural conditions were mixed across regions. "
"16960400","16966700"," Farmers were supported by surging crop prices, but drought conditions were a challenge in some"
"16966700","16967060"," districts."
"16967860","16972600"," And increasing input costs were squeezing producer margins across the nation."
"16973280","16979240"," Outlooks for future growth were plotted by the uncertainty created by recent geopolitical"
"16979240","16981640"," developments in rising prices. "
"16982680","16983540"," That's how you crane."
"16984660","16987000"," And labor market's employment increased."
"16987580","16989540"," Hold on here, at a moderate pace. "
"16991100","16995100"," Demand for workers continued to be strong across most districts and industry sectors."
"16995980","17001320"," That's good to hear, but hiring was held back by the overall lack of available workers."
"17001320","17002560"," That's actually good too. "
"17003440","17006820"," Leaves more profits for businesses."
"17013420","17014200"," What else is saying here?"
"17016820","17021880"," Districts did report signs of modest improvement worker availability, i.e. I'm willing to go back"
"17021880","17022800"," to work in the office."
"17023540","17028940"," There's been a push within businesses to bring fuel back to the office. "

"17046200","17050680"," Firms reported that inflationary pressures were also contributing to higher wages. "
"17053240","17056600"," And then higher wages are doing little to alleviate widespread job vacancies."
"17057580","17063960"," But some contacts reported early signs that the strong pace of wage growth has begun to slow."
"17064640","17072700"," That's good for some guidances that should come out for future guidances in this ER cycle. "
"17073320","17076600"," Prices and inflationary pressures remain strong since the last report."
"17077180","17081200"," But firms continuing to pass swiftly rising input costs through to customers."
"17082640","17087720"," So you may want to expect to hear that being passed or that those pass alongs being reported in"

"17090260","17092900"," Contacts across districts, particularly those in manufacturing."

"17098900","17104340"," Contacts across districts, particularly those in manufacturing noted steep increases in raw"
"17104340","17107580"," materials, transfer and labor costs in multiple districts."

"17130440","17135800"," contract terms or only honoring price quotes for 24 hours."
"17136660","17144180"," Strong demand generally allowed firms to pass through input costs, cost increases to customers, for"
"17144180","17147560"," example, via fuel surcharges for freight and airline fares. "
"17148260","17151940"," However, contacts in a few districts noted negative sales impact from rising prices."
"17154510","17159830"," Firms in most districts expected inflationary pressures to continue over the coming months."
"17164610","17167170"," Kind of in line what we're all talking about out there, right?"
"17175320","17178040"," So we'll take a look and see the reaction here. "
"17182240","17198580"," Some of that little bit of cell pressure above it, $4.48, $4 "

"17228400","17230600"," SLB is an interesting call."
"17231420","17235660"," June 17, $42.5, C for $350,000."
"17244820","17246840"," We'll take a look at T here in a minute. "
"17249980","17252580"," Still see some sellers congregating above here."
"17252840","17253760"," Buyers down below."
"17274420","17284510"," This almost reminds me of Dell. "
"17288700","17291600"," Huge gap down here, right, on Dell."
"17297540","17298800"," Just lots of call buyers down here."
"17298980","17300580"," Just they're just loading up and loading up. "
"17315350","17317350"," Just grinding, grinding, grinding in here."
"17318670","17325430"," Just a note that calls, there's been lots of unusual volume on T that's been going on for at least"
"17325430","17328410"," a week since this steep drop sell-off."
"17342590","17345130"," Watching this nice bear flag form up here. "
"17349900","17351200"," Let me get going on over here."
"17351760","17352500"," I don't know if it's a bear flag."
"17359240","17364520"," The bear's still hanging around up here. "
"17372480","17377720"," It's that beige book is, that beige book is, I mean, it's not, I think we don't know."
"17378360","17379920"," There's some positives to it."
"17380020","17381240"," There's some negatives to it. "
"17382320","17384320"," It's right back to that same headline news."
"17384920","17392740"," You're still looking for some sort of truce or cessation and you're still giving us in the, let's"
"17392740","17393580"," have a look here or here."
"17394640","17397820"," Here in the cater is mainly in line with the day here. "
"17398160","17399940"," It's back and forth, back and forth, back and forth."
"17400540","17411420"," Slightly more buyers and sellers currently just sitting"
"17411420","17412180"," on VWAP."
"17412260","17414100"," Here we'll see where the, where the sellers are above. "
"17416980","17418640"," Kind of hiding out above here at 448."
"17419980","17421960"," Probably up to 449, 463."
"17425340","17427000"," So you can see where the dip buyers are. "
"17427860","17437180"," Yeah, right down here, 444.50. 446 around VWAP, 445.50, 444 "
"17437180","17443000",".50, 444.50, 444.50. Let me peek down below."
"17444800","17447040"," Big buyers waiting down below it, 440."
"17448840","17450300"," All day long, been sitting there. "
"17479540","17482920"," Now I was thinking to look at Tesla earlier, it's from their earlier reports."
"17488600","17490820"," It just keeps creeping along here into the close."
"17492220","17493620"," Almost like a pinning action in here. "
"17495990","17504390"," The Tesla really needs to, for Tesla not to trade, for Tesla not to trade in the pattern that it's"
"17504390","17504630"," in."
"17505250","17509150"," I mean, it really needs to be fucking explosive, either on the negative or in the positive."
"17509410","17513950"," If it's not explosive in their earnings reports, they tend to trade. "
"17516150","17519810"," They tend to trade, it tends to stay trading within its ranges."
"17522730","17525070"," So I'm really looking for some kind of a buy down here."
"17525310","17530940"," I'm going to put that one there in something down here. "
"17530940","17538840"," As this is outside of something that's not known about Tesla, like we're not known, it tends to"
"17538840","17543200"," stay in its trading zone, even in their ear airports."
"17544240","17554240"," That could be as little as 950 for a neutral report to a slightly negative report down to"
"17554240","17554480"," 900."
"17555680","17562080"," And they could get ugly down to 700 if there's any kind of nonsense like Netflix did. "
"17562080","17568520"," If they have a positive report, I still don't see it, believe it or not, I still don't see it"
"17568520","17570740"," not selling down and picking back up to go higher."
"17571880","17575440"," It has to really be something abnormal."
"17576660","17582000"," I bet Elon has to be there because of that bullshit, but he's going to be asked some important"
"17582000","17590700"," questions, probably tied to the purchase of Twitter as well. "
"17590700","17603060"," I don't know if they'll let those people ask those questions, but touch"
"17603060","17605780"," above, touch below, touch above, touch below, touch above."
"17606120","17607960"," We'll see if we can trade it down here."
"17611120","17631530"," Dude, this is a slow fucking day, slow day. "
"17673890","17676130"," I was looking back on Tesla ERs."
"17676210","17686020"," I mean, literally, you have to be, you have to be, the ER"
"17686020","17689160"," is not something explosive that you haven't seen."
"17695950","17698230"," Something explosive that you just have not seen. "
"17702320","17706400"," Looking back, it just trades like normal."
"17707680","17710180"," And if anything, if there's a dip to buy, it's after."
"17714070","17716050"," I don't know if that's inclusion in the S&P 500. "
"17776770","17780010"," It's scrolling through any Ukraine news or not seeing anything of note."
"17798910","17801690"," Oh, yeah, nice little push down on the spy real quick."
"17809720","17810880"," Tag, tag, tag. "
"17812400","17814800"," Let's see if we can get this roll off into the clothes."
"17838070","17848040"," Yeah, I saw the calls at YY 13,000, 429, 43,"
"17848340","17848940"," see, I saw those."
"17850440","17851280"," Calls on Baba too. "
"17851420","17853360"," There's a whole bunch of calls coming in with high Elgo scores."
"17854220","17858820"," YY, ESSC, more T calls or no, I think that was earlier."
"17859720","17861040"," I was like 10 minutes ago, Baba. "
"17872630","17874310"," It's just because so much is already known."
"17874530","17876970"," The delivery number is already being announced prior to report."
"17877410","17886730"," Yeah, it's a, yeah, a spy, spy still rolling over slightly as well. "
"17891470","17892290"," Right here."
"17897440","17899820"," For Wednesday puts, I think I don't think it matters."
"17900020","17901800"," I think my Wednesday puts don't matter at this point. "
"17904460","17905600"," Yeah, I don't think they matter."
"17917860","17919760"," Friday puts are getting worked over still."
"17921480","17926580"," We need to see the leg down below 440 for those to start, making a difference. "
"17930250","17933090"," I'm ready to buy in some calls down here too in just a moment."
"17934110","17935530"," Let's see if they can grab something down here."
"17941780","17943560"," Let's see if there's a place to buy some calls. "
"17948300","17949220"," Is that 444?"
"17950100","17953060"," This is actually a rug pull going on down below here."
"17953360","17954520"," This is interesting to see."
"17955580","17959700"," Whatever rug pull that was down here earlier, there was some holding here. "
"17960280","17966260"," 444.60 has been here for some time, but this 443.20 is disappearing."
"17966920","17967520"," That's good to see."
"17970610","17972110"," It's still kind of there. "
"17976270","17978330"," Click to see if we can hit that 440 into the bell."
"18006500","18010540"," TLT has come down a little bit, starting to roll slightly down to this trend."
"18035820","18037400"," Let's see if we can get a rug pull down in here. "
"18038660","18040860"," 445.60, this is that same spot right here."
"18040960","18042220"," This is where some support should be."
"18043180","18043800"," And then noticing. "
"18046340","18048800"," Looks like they're coming back out to play a little bit in here."
"18064770","18066190"," Then we get a nice rug pull."
"18092870","18095910"," That same little bar of buyers down below here. "
"18097170","18105440"," 445.45. Same buyers showing up back here."

"18167740","18173880"," We'll take a look at this 445 and write down and see if those buyers maintain."
"18174560","18182900"," So right there right here 445.40. 444.60. So these buyers right here are kind of disappearing. "
"18183700","18184960"," Not quite there."
"18185580","18190600"," You can see these buyers stepping in at 444.60. Could get a little bit more juice out of it."
"18191660","18193520"," To write about here. "
"18194900","18198760"," To move this tag down 446 right here."

"18337600","18338900"," As a Elon will be on."
"18339080","18342400"," We'll have to listen to the, we'll have to put the live stream on."
"18357330","18360910"," Now I think that he hasn't talked just about product announcements. "
"18361170","18366330"," I think he's also talked about a controversial topic."
"18366330","18367450"," I think he said he'd be there."
"18367630","18368650"," He said he's just that important. "
"18368970","18369630"," Just a few minutes here."
"18369710","18371510"," Head of the close of pitch rating and energy markets."
"18371590","18372670"," WTI crude futures. "

"18382710","18388310"," Natural gas futures are down three and a half percent at six dollars and 93 cents as we push"
"18388310","18388950"," towards the close."
"18391990","18393590"," That was financial balance. "
"18393590","18394190"," I'm seeking nature."
"18396450","18400370"," Yeah, I think that Elon, it's like new products and then it's anything."
"18400750","18403110"," Anytime that he thinks it's important for him to be there. "
"18403570","18407790"," I remember the one time he wasn't there and I remember the one time he wasn't there and they tried"
"18407790","18411430"," to sabotage the QA stuff."
"18420350","18426490"," Yeah, that's what this is what the thought process is."
"18426570","18428950"," Is that we should get a 440 by the close. "
"18432180","18434520"," We should get down here towards the bell."
"18443940","18449580"," This is the price target on the day is down here to 440."
"18449960","18456760"," It should be swift to be fast and then now I'm not sure if that happens. "
"18456980","18458220"," We've got a ton of puts out there."
"18458520","18460280"," Just a mega fuck kind of puts."
"18461300","18464020"," They just keep loading them and loading them and loading them and loading them. "
"18465280","18467500"," So price target into the close."
"18471020","18473520"," Quick can't confirm it's going to happen, but that's the hope."
"18473740","18482910"," Now right now we've got some buyers still stepping in down here. "
"18483090","18486970"," Day traders somewhere in this vicinity between 444-60."
"18487550","18488990"," The hope was that we could get down there."
"18490030","18494610"," More from the feds daily saying we can absolutely make a balance sheet announcement in May and rate"
"18494610","18496970"," hikes to help cool further house price appreciation. "
"18498010","18500550"," Labor market is getting to a point where it is frothy."
"18501110","18503770"," Digital comments from San Francisco feds daily."
"18503770","18505850"," You can see some buyers stepping in right now. "
"18506150","18510030"," Think she does see a really solid case for a 50 basis screen rate hike in May."
"18511910","18513870"," Be a grind all the way down to 443."
"18517810","18520610"," Some rug pulling going on down here right now. "
"18520670","18521470"," Just adds up on that."
"18521570","18524890"," We're going to have percent of what she views as neutral is not abrupt or surprising."
"18525110","18525250"," 440. "
"18525250","18540400"," And we"
"18540400","18544080"," are also watching this zone down here."
"18544700","18550460"," I did move this S1 support down to 440-60 because there are buyers sitting down here."
"18553170","18558910"," This should be lower down here, but they have moved to this area right here. "
"18569210","18572210"," Telling me this is like these fucking days."
"18572570","18574590"," You don't want to do is I'm going to set up like a hammock."
"18577890","18587770"," I'm going to set up a fucking hammock and just like swing in my"
"18587770","18589230"," hammock on these slow ass days. "
"18597800","18599560"," Plus I was supposed to get a permit today."
"18599780","18601840"," So I might I might end up actually doing that tomorrow."
"18602480","18607280"," I have to get a permit and sometimes it's 15 fucking minutes and sometimes it's hours. "
"18614640","18617340"," But I did get I did get a cool new spray gun for trim."
"18618380","18620300"," What was that spray with spray gun that I got?"
"18624700","18627240"," So I have like a big I got a big house sprayer."
"18627900","18632280"," It's like a great go X5 or something or X7. "
"18634600","18642700"," And I I want to paint trim with oil based high gloss white paint."
"18644080","18648480"," Sort of this little thing called a critter sprayer to siphon gun."
"18649280","18651220"," You can do it for like our projects and stuff. "
"18652500","18654960"," So I'm hoping that works well for trim."
"18656280","18660820"," I've seen like a bunch of people on YouTube use it for cabinets and stuff."
"18661100","18665960"," So I'm hoping I can spray oil based paint for a nice nice clean coat. "
"18666700","18668840"," When I got some I got some boat trim I got to do too."
"18670920","18674960"," I'm about to sell my boat to my sailboat."
"18675060","18676180"," I want to buy a bigger sailboat. "
"18676180","18680640"," So I so I redid all the all the wood on it."
"18681840","18687060"," And I sanded off there was I don't know if it was a gel coat but the gel coat was"
"18687060","18688060"," old as fuck."
"18688740","18698480"," So I took off the gel coat and I made some repairs from some oopsies some some minor groundings"
"18698480","18704340"," that I had and I let the let the holes drain out for the winter. "
"18708740","18713560"," And spring is coming the crazy part is I've got a complete boat that I'm selling."
"18714700","18718400"," It's got everything I'm including everything in this boat it's ready to sail."
"18719180","18724900"," And so the last thing I have to do to this boat is paint up some trim and paint the"
"18724900","18725120"," hull. "
"18726060","18727380"," And this it's a sailboat."
"18729300","18731300"," Let's see if we can get this break here or not."
"18732420","18733620"," Making my eyes bleed. "
"18751790","18752690"," I'm still waiting."
"18755490","18756730"," So what are you guys staying up there?"
"18756870","18764000"," Hold on open my windows and spray it oil based."
"18764000","18765020"," I didn't know that. "
"18765020","18765740"," I didn't know that."
"18767240","18768320"," Still waiting on calls."
"18768640","18768960"," I want to get. "

"18778720","18781840"," Under roof eaves in my house never again was that rough huh?"
"18784220","18788900"," I've got a so when it comes to like a house spraying and stuff like paint spraying."
"18789500","18791040"," I've sprayed a ton of interiors."
"18791040","18793280"," I've sprayed with my X5. "
"18793280","18795580"," I've sprayed but that's all water based paint."
"18796240","18800740"," So I use shields and then I bring brown buckets of water to wipe."
"18801000","18802760"," But I've never sprayed with oil based paint. "
"18803940","18805540"," I'm assuming it's going to be a shit toe."
"18808910","18812720"," I usually brush trim."
"18818590","18823190"," So this summer I'm going to take I'm going to start looking for a boat. "
"18823190","18826670"," A very big large boat this year."
"18828640","18831980"," Starting to break through finally on the spy."
"18835240","18836640"," Nice move lower here. "
"18836840","18840460"," We'll have a price target down below as we talked about earlier here."
"18841060","18843800"," There's this one little moment down here at 4.44 60."
"18844940","18846120"," So we'll take a look here. "
"18848240","18851300"," And we're down it's right I put it right here it's 4.44 60."
"18852220","18854660"," So we'll see if we get this tag real quick here."
"18855220","18857700"," There's some some some small buyers here. "
"18858580","18861560"," We'll see if we get that that touch on 4.44 60."
"18862560","18866560"," And you might see at this point a snap higher."
"18868080","18872900"," And then a continuation down to 4.40. And to the bell. "
"18878000","18880740"," And we'll see what you guys are talking about."
"18885760","18888060"," Oh yeah the rebottling post fucking Christ."
"18888800","18893580"," They turned like a fucking an 18 inch beam into a fucking 4 by 2 by 4."
"18895500","18898180"," You can't spray all this fine get ready for the super mess. "
"18898320","18900260"," I wasn't thinking about the mess I should."
"18908210","18910510"," Thanks for the heads up on the thorough cleanup job."
"18917540","18919700"," I'll paint there yeah of course paint there. "
"18925530","18932390"," Yeah so what we do on trim is what we do on trim is I spray with the gun on"
"18932390","18933950"," the trim with the big gun believe it or not."
"18934810","18937970"," And with with two people hopping with shields."
"18938870","18941410"," And then I back brush everything as it goes on. "
"18941730","18944110"," And we back roll I back roll everything on the house too."
"18944250","18948670"," But getting the material on the wall and the cracks and the holes all that kind of shit the gun"
"18948670","18949590"," works really well."
"18949730","18951390"," So this is to the pin strike down here. "
"18952890","18957370"," If you're in puts you get out of your puts right there and then look for another reversal."
"18958270","18959110"," It's within a penny."
"18961450","18963550"," A nice little breakthrough right there. "
"18963770","18968310"," We'll see we can see this liquidity rate."
"18968510","18969850"," This little bit of support right here."
"18970270","18972330"," This should get pulled at some point. "
"18973190","18978850"," And you'll see you'll see rejection above we'll look above and see where the rejection should come"
"18978850","18978990"," in."
"18981170","18984690"," And then the price target below here where we are currently."
"18990640","19000500"," We've got some some volatility down here down to 442.80. But in reality the price target you can"
"19000500","19001240"," see it right there. "
"19002480","19004000"," 442.20. 442."
"19005400","19006360"," So we'll look at that real quick."
"19012670","19014710"," Yeah that's just that trigger down in here. "
"19017030","19018170"," That trigger is pretty big."
"19018250","19019610"," What do you want you to be concerned with that?"
"19019710","19023630"," You kind of need banks to sell this portion of the trade."
"19024670","19031710"," So like from here to here this being the vol trigger. "
"19032010","19034590"," It's going to take selling."
"19034950","19036230"," It's going to take banks selling."
"19037050","19038210"," Let's figure this move lower. "
"19040410","19041910"," So knock, knock, knock on the door."
"19042150","19042850"," Knock, knock, knock."
"19043470","19044650"," You want to see aggressive. "
"19044930","19048710"," We'll look for aggressive selling here into it's already 239."
"19049010","19052310"," You might not get this aggressive selling until the the sell side."
"19052450","19057570"," My assumption is that the trigger is an imbalance to the sell side. "
"19057910","19061870"," Then you'll get that move down and then we'll end the day at 440."
"19064880","19066620"," Just keep pounding on the door down here."
"19067740","19069640"," It's not going to be easy to get through. "
"19070140","19071420"," You're going to need some help."
"19071420","19074560"," So the help will more than likely be a sell side imbalance."
"19074960","19081680"," I went to want to bet there's a sell side imbalance once we get into three o'clock hour down"
"19081680","19081920"," here. "
"19082980","19084880"," I bet they've already have it lined up."
"19087080","19089280"," I bet it's already on order but they got like an intern."
"19095360","19096780"," It's a nice little trade right here. "
"19104130","19109690"," Yeah so if you're checking if you've got a time delay on the stream then you just go down to"
"19109690","19114230"," the you go down to the options on YouTube and you fast forward it."
"19114270","19116910"," I'll sound kind of goofy for like 15 seconds."
"19117130","19122050"," It's something that YouTube does and it'll catch you back up and then I'll sound like I'm not"
"19122050","19122270"," delayed. "
"19122410","19123030"," I'll be instant."
"19123790","19127050"," I'll be like a few seconds delay."
"19165640","19167820"," Let me see you guys are saying 40 footer. "
"19168420","19173540"," I'm looking for I'm on the fence right now on I'm on a fence right now on what I'm buying."
"19174400","19176180"," My wife wants to buy a catamaran."
"19176180","19177340"," I want to buy a monohull. "
"19179120","19188990"," We're gonna get out of rig and just stay focused on I want to monohull for sailing the"
"19188990","19189250"," world."
"19190030","19195470"," Then I've got some friends that say I should buy like a coastal cruiser in case I don't."
"19195530","19199290"," Don't buy a blue water sailor until I actually take the trip. "
"19202480","19203640"," We're just gonna look real quick."
"19205000","19207500"," I only want to sail around the world."
"19207640","19210440"," I don't want to live in a boat in the Caribbean. "
"19212920","19214040"," I don't want to live in a boat."
"19214240","19217600"," I don't want to I just want to do the world trip and then be done with it and go."
"19218060","19221900"," I want to retire I think in South America Central America or Mexico or something. "
"19223970","19226690"," Probably South America so that can ski too and serve."
"19227790","19232010"," But you can see we're trying to knock on this door to break through this zone here."
"19232330","19233250"," We need to sell them balance. "
"19233390","19237970"," We need to get 17 minutes so we get to sell them balance to the south side so we can"
"19237970","19242610"," break through this vault figure down here and try to tag 440 into the bell."
"19243310","19248950"," Now the question becomes if you're a bearish right is does this make the bear case roles have their"
"19248950","19249930"," chance and didn't take it."
"19251050","19256890"," But is there still risk for that that much higher trade in the market?"
"19258910","19261490"," So that's the risk that you have to take on as a bull or a bear. "
"19282050","19286230"," The to the boat that I want to take is or I'm gonna I like the bed of toe that"
"19286230","19289070"," Jo Donut talks about I've been falling more and more in love with that boat."
"19289770","19294670"," But I also like some older boats I like more length like the water line linked over water to be"
"19294670","19296450"," kind of I don't like paying extra fees."
"19297010","19301870"," I don't want to pay extra fees for sailing and I like the idea of getting somewhere fast and then"
"19301870","19304750"," I like I don't like the jarring motion of a catamaran. "
"19305310","19312370"," My wife likes the idea of the time on the water too which with the catamaran would would answer"
"19312370","19313030"," that question."
"19313490","19320290"," I don't know so much these days about the risk on the ocean people talk about with the electronics"
"19320290","19320770"," today."
"19322030","19327330"," It's it's really hard to get yourself in a bad situation on the water believe it or not. "
"19327710","19332370"," Lots of puts coming in on the cues and spy right now some IWM dip fires."

"19777740","19780000"," So we'll see if we get this power. "
"19780300","19789220"," Now with that being said uh we have this uh vault trigger down here right and we have uh some"
"19789220","19789800"," support here."
"19789800","19791220"," We're looking to see this go away."
"19791640","19794780"," So what do you need for a trigger to grind through these buyers?"
"19795940","19800860"," Uh well you're either going to grind through like we are right now but to see some free falling"
"19800860","19806880"," through here you probably need to have a sell side imbalance uh an early sell side imbalance. "
"19807240","19813020"," There's probably an intern somewhere as uh told to release that information publicly um so we can"
"19813020","19814160"," start to make our way lower."
"19815240","19816660"," I'm gonna close the day here at 440."
"19817040","19824760"," Now with all this said um the question still arises uh does the market continue on its merry way"
"19824760","19828140"," down staying within that should that negative channel. "
"19828660","19830120"," It is currently right now."
"19830440","19837400"," We are still inside of this channel even with this pop above uh and that's that keeps the bear case"
"19837400","19842460"," alive uh but we still have the door open here until we break through the vault trigger."
"19842640","19848600"," We still have or at least if it whole if the vault trigger holds it keeps the uh bold the"
"19848600","19851320"," new bookcase alive for much higher prices. "
"19852060","19859160"," Now without uh if we don't hold this vault trigger then you want to get back on the in bear"
"19859160","19864420"," town uh the other point that you need to pay attention to is you need to trade below it and"
"19864420","19872740"," get a rejection on on this to take this down to your first test here at 435 and then your"
"19872740","19878600"," next test below somewhere down here like 424 421 depending on the day we get there we take it takes"
"19878600","19882380"," us three or four days it'll be like 424 if it takes like a day or two it'll only take"
"19882380","19884940"," like we don't like 421 or 420 or something."
"19887340","19893060"," Uh so we are rolling over here uh currently but this is an important area same important area"
"19893060","19898180"," matter of fact as we talked yesterday when we came up here you want to see us hold it uh"
"19898180","19903160"," to make that full case and then you want to see us reject it uh to make that bear case"
"19911570","19921050"," just nice quick grinding down grinding through these layers down here you need to see a rug pull so"
"19922940","19927880"," you can see them right here right you need to grind through this the only way grind through this is"
"19927880","19933840"," uh south side of imbalance even if it's just early wink wink S&P futures now testing 4450 to the"
"19933840","19939520"," downside down about nine handles as we're seeing US equity futures slide oh yeah TLT bold checking"

"19986490","19996310"," uh the mini the trigger is 443.89 the court"

"20153040","20165350"," look for another rejection above here we'll lower this for 60 to 450 to then"
"20165350","20172270"," continue our way down into uh bringing it down right here uh so we'll look for another we'll look"
"20172270","20180670"," for another attempt for a trade lower same as we had up here all right we talked about look another"
"20180670","20186630"," nice resistance point to come back down and get this other level down here 4430 this is the trigger"
"20186630","20198800"," we'll do it again and again hopefully right into the bell if you"
