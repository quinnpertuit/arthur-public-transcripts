"98630","101110"," Yeah, there we go."
"101510","102290"," Oh, yeah."
"103570","104390"," Oh, yeah. "
"106290","107430"," Good morning, everybody."
"109930","110890"," What's everybody doing?"
"111590","113030"," Yeah, it makes us back up here."
"115350","117390"," We bring up here to bring this one up. "
"119230","120230"," How's everybody doing today?"
"120690","126550"," Let's see if we can get the comments there and bring that one up."
"129570","130430"," How are we getting there?"
"130810","131130"," We're getting closer."
"133930","134930"," Everybody's doing well this morning. "
"135430","136330"," You guys saw him hit me out there?"
"138130","139370"," Hope you guys can get me out there."
"139790","142230"," So, I'm still working on, uh, I got a bunch of stuff."
"142430","146370"," We're working on here, but it's like my game's a little high this morning. "
"146630","147170"," We'll turn that down."
"149430","150770"," Let's see what's in here right now."
"152070","152590"," Good morning, Gerald. "
"152850","153470"," Good morning, Crossy."
"153650","154870"," Good morning, not a super engine bar."
"154870","157510"," John Smith, Jake Euthist, and Eddie Lee's. "
"158270","164250"," Marcus Stevens, and then he got three Danny, Dan Cornish, Pathen, Gerald, Sheeshiner, Richard."
"165070","169210"," He's on Hot, Hot, Hot, X, 3 of a blind nest that was moved."
"169770","172270"," Marcus, Thomas, 3-3-3-4, Dan. "
"172970","175090"," Good morning, music's a bit too loud."
"175470","176330"," We'll send that down a little bit."
"176670","178210"," I think my microphone's really high, too. "
"179430","180710"," Turn that down a little bit."
"184690","186750"," A bunch of different ways to go around here."
"187330","188990"," I got some mixer issues this morning. "
"189150","190690"," I've got, like, double stuff going on."
"191650","192510"," Good to see everybody."
"192670","194550"," Good morning, Pathen. "
"194670","195310"," Good morning, Marcus."
"195590","197210"," Coach, thanks for saying our good morning."
"198390","199550"," Marcus sold the clothes. "
"200390","203570"," Marcus must be stoked this morning without"
"203570","213750"," a"
"213750","213770"," doubt."
"216070","217630"," Starting yesterday at some point."
"217890","222570"," I took the rips up higher, but I was buying puts all the way up into four today. "
"223390","226570"," So Samuel, Jeremy, Dejan, JB, James P."
"227730","228970"," Microphone is lower than the music."
"229190","230410"," Yeah, I just lowered the mic real quick."
"230510","231190"," I probably shouldn't have. "
"231890","233410"," So we're going to turn the music off anyways."
"234070","236130"," What we're going to do is we're going to have a quick talk this morning."
"236130","236250"," Good morning. "
"237770","238550"," I'll be tested."
"239050","247230"," I muted my, what I'm doing was muting my, I forget what it's called, but my monitor this morning."
"247650","249690"," So what I'll try to do is I'll turn up my mic a little bit here. "
"250530","252050"," I had turned it down slightly."
"252710","253530"," See if that helps."
"253990","259450"," So if any guys, I know some of you out there have PCs or phones that don't play too loud,"
"259630","261170"," so it's back up. "
"261170","268790"," I think I have the live stream up and running inside of discord this morning."
"268790","269810"," It's on a voice channel."
"270750","274530"," I think it's on the stock market chat voice channel inside the discord. "
"274990","276750"," So you do have live stream."
"277550","282330"," You just make the screen large and it'll give you real time options flow."
"282890","284330"," It's 903 this morning. "
"285170","287350"," We're going to get some stuff out of the way and we're going to talk about the market."
"287350","290110"," We're going to talk about how to trade quad-witching."
"290590","293250"," What you guys are always should always be looking for in quad-witching. "
"293250","296010"," We're going to address 4050 4000."
"296270","298270"," We're going to address 4510."
"299950","302910"," We're going to address some stuff here and do some talking. "
"303690","312030"," Now I have not, so I had set up a, I haven't set up with one of the interns plugging"
"312030","315750"," this stuff in for me for trading view to share with you every morning, but I will have that by"
"315750","316210"," the weekend."
"316210","321190"," I'm going to have to get her on teacher how to input the data every day."
"321450","322290"," So you'll have that by Monday. "
"322690","326910"," Until then, right now, I just want you to look and see these levels here."
"327630","332170"," You can come back in the video, pause it, come back as I close these out so you can see"
"332170","334930"," the gamma levels for the market."
"335190","339270"," This is of course RTY, the rut, the Russell F and crow. "
"340510","343690"," Then here we have NDX, NASDAQ."
"344170","345630"," The next one here is spy."
"346130","349850"," So you have your spy levels for 40, for 42, 45, for 50. "
"354350","355710"," And hold on a second here."
"359640","360780"," Spring time's coming."
"361520","363200"," And then this is the spy of course. "
"364040","365200"," And this is the SPX numbers."
"365440","368980"," You can always pause this broadcast, come back to them until they have them on trading view in a"
"368980","369640"," script for you."
"369640","370920"," I did make the script. "
"371240","374540"," I looked at it last night and I think I might have fucked up the script."
"375480","378860"," I was trying to adjust the script or something like the kind of nonsense like that."
"378960","386540"," Anyways, today from the economic calendar we had existing home sales this morning at 9am. "
"387080","390600"," My original outlook on existing home sales would be that they would trail off."
"391380","393160"," I've changed my viewpoint on that."
"394060","398280"," I think with the Fed trying to manipulate the market for the next year or two, believe it or not. "
"398280","400000"," There's some disagreement on that."
"400360","404420"," That we might have a decent housing market for the next year or two."
"404640","405860"," I think it's going to extend. "
"407140","410720"," We had an 815, excuse me, that's, I was just trying to hear."
"413220","419220"," And then at 9am, excuse me, 1130am, we've got the Fed, the Fed, little chair, bark and speaking."
"420600","422040"," So keep an eye on the 1130 hour. "
"422040","424240"," We've got Evans speaking at 1pm."
"424820","427600"," Then we've got Bowman speaking at 2pm."
"428340","431420"," So there is some volatility slated for today. "
"431920","435040"," Of course, the other big news today is we've got OPEC's today."
"435960","440160"," We've got those, OPEC's really should can't extend into the month, believe it or not."
"441700","446020"," How I trade OPEC's typically is if I'm already in a position. "
"447140","449540"," Let's say I'm in a position, doesn't matter if it's long or short."
"450220","453780"," You should get good opportunities today to close those out."
"454420","457980"," So if you see you're in a position and you're not quite happy with it. "
"458400","460360"," Sometimes at some point today."
"461240","463120"," You may see that position improve."
"463640","466300"," So don't lose hope whatever position that you're in out there. "
"466680","471660"," As people are closing their positions for the quarter and reopening new positions for the next"
"471660","473460"," quarter and what their plan is, right?"
"473600","478400"," What the position is leading up to the next quarter or for the next three months."
"478400","485300"," So you might see a wild action within the market today and furthermore, with that, you'll see you"
"485300","486880"," should typically see a high volume day."
"487300","490060"," This doesn't always work out well for day trading. "
"490800","496820"," But if you're in current positions, you'll sometimes see your positions improve wildly at different"
"496820","497920"," points in the day."
"498320","505240"," You will see moments where the market is quiet and then you'll see moments of of hectic volume in"
"505240","505640"," the market."
"505640","510940"," The next thing that I want you to realize today is on quad wakes, which is typically between the"
"510940","514659"," hours of three and four p.m. We have the highest volatility of the day. "
"515159","517679"," Now JPR spark Amazon has an implied move."
"517780","521000"," They have only a think point eight six percent, not too bad."
"521440","524900"," But I don't know if I believe that that will be the case at all times today. "
"524920","526780"," I think you will see some violent moves."
"527540","534440"," There's sometimes an opportunity here to look for stocks that have maybe been beaten down for a"
"534440","535260"," year three months."
"536000","538440"," And see some of the shorts lifted off those. "
"538840","543840"," You might even see an aggressive short on those stocks for a capitulation move down."
"544160","549160"," And the point in that is if you've had your eye on a stock, keep your eye on it today,"
"549540","550820"," because you might have that moment."
"550960","552900"," You like a perfect one be like paramount, like by com. "
"553220","555620"," I'm not saying that stock specifically, but a stock like that."
"556020","562840"," You might see a capitulation move way, way deep, deep down or a squeeze higher today."
"562840","567340"," But if you see like that move way down, you might want to grab a stock like that. "
"567680","572560"," If you see a stock like that instead that squeezes higher, it might be time to take some profit on"
"572560","573220"," a stock like that."
"573660","578660"," So just be patient in your positions that you're already in today, because you might get some"
"578660","582720"," closure to some longs that you have or even some shorts that you have in this market."
"583340","584700"," So I'll be paying attention to that. "
"584960","585700"," Be patient."
"586240","589620"," Friday, Opa, quad, quad, which is always a time to be patient."
"590060","594680"," I've seen Tesla in the past, it just dropped 90 points on a quad, which. "
"595040","596400"," So just be patient."
"596720","599040"," Sometimes that first dip isn't the dip you're looking for."
"599200","603400"," And then sometimes it's that time of the day you're looking for that high volume moment in whatever"
"603400","604720"," stock they're moving in and out of. "
"605480","609760"," And repositioning and you might see stocks that have been, that have been huge for a year and start"
"609760","611080"," selling off at some point today."
"611080","614260"," Okay, something you've been in for nine months or a year."
"614940","616540"," You might see it got actually grip higher. "
"616920","621120"," You'd want to take profit at that point in case they dump it at some point later today."
"621820","625140"," Spock again, this morning, this morning is saying futures were quite overnight."
"625820","626640"," Not so right. "
"627100","628200"," We're holding near 4380."
"629100","634180"," Our volatile expectations decreased dramatically today, but then she implied move of 0.86%. Opened"
"634180","636000"," to close versus 1.40% yesterday."
"636200","638760"," We see resistance at 4400 and 4425. "
"638760","640320"," I'll show you those marks."
"640660","645020"," I posted that that on at captain's captain's off this morning with the new support and resistance"
"645020","645460"," lines."
"646000","648880"," And support shows at 4380 4350. "
"649140","650240"," Op X day has finally arrived."
"650660","655560"," Our models show roughly one third of the total SB QQ's options positions expiring today for both"
"655560","656260"," the SPX by."
"657500","659540"," The 4400 strike is dominant. "
"660280","662000"," We look for a pinning around this area today."
"662500","666460"," The chart here shows just how large this 4400 call position is."
"666460","669160"," So right now we're trading low, right?"
"669280","669860"," We're trading 435. "
"670400","672540"," We idea would be that we're going to pin 4400 today."
"672560","673680"," That's what Spock Emma's saying."
"673880","675200"," Now there's a flip side to this. "
"676220","678420"," It was the spy flow, which was most interesting yesterday."
"678640","681140"," Large volumes of 4400 and 4350."
"681460","687620"," But interestingly, despite over 35 or 30 or 350,000 contracts right at 440 C."
"687860","690280"," We talked about that strike yesterday all day long. "
"690760","693760"," The net open interest change was minus 1277."
"693760","699380"," Further open interest change table will show spy calls for net clothes that strikes less than 438."
"700440","703240"," We suspect this trading is tied to the spy dividend. "
"703900","706860"," Now remember yesterday when I talked to you and said, Hey, look, at some point."
"707060","711060"," Remember at some point yesterday, I said to you, Hey, do you see the premium slipping off this"
"711060","712000"," small move down?"
"712380","716800"," That was closure of those 440 calls before they came to fruition, right?"
"716980","722380"," We actually saw that happen yesterday where I said, Hey, you're seeing a premium kick off of this"
"722380","723740"," of this strike right now."
"724360","726720"," This is broken as we're making our dips. "
"726720","730480"," We weren't really losing a lot of premium, but then at some point we did later in the day."
"731120","732540"," And so that's what they're talking about here."
"732960","736500"," Because of the steps of central rally in the market for the past few days, the money of X hedge"
"736500","737740"," clearing day is a bit more cloudy. "
"738760","743000"," Okay, this is if you don't understand this, we'll discuss it this in the broadcast today."
"743040","744420"," I'll explain it deeper if you'd like."
"744780","749580"," This is because large propositions have been crushed before OPEC's before OPEC's not leading into"
"749580","753140"," OPEC's, but before, which may reduce the related hedge unwind for Monday. "
"753600","757880"," Meaning they may not get that continued ripping rally on Monday."
"758640","762740"," Recall back to January when the market was screening lower into Friday, OPEC's midday on Monday,"
"762780","763320"," the market's bounced."
"763800","765340"," This time the OPEC's energy show speaks. "
"765420","769900"," Matter of fact, this bounce on that Monday, if you bought the first one, you got fucked."
"770200","772320"," It kept selling off on that day."
"772420","773380"," I remember this day clearly. "
"774240","776340"," This time the OPEC's energy show speak has already been discharged."
"776340","781700"," Therefore, we will enter Monday with a reduced notional gamma, which applies less dealer hedging"
"781700","782140"," impact."
"782520","784960"," If markets retain the 4400 level, this is key. "
"785980","786200"," Okay."
"786580","788980"," Then a grind higher up to 4500 seems likely."
"789320","790240"," We'd have reduced volatility. "
"791200","792540"," It'll take time though."
"792900","798080"," Good time to put some spreads on if we can maintain 440, some call spreads to go north to 4500."
"798800","802400"," Probably not a good time to buy weeklies or monthly calls at 450. "
"802960","804660"," Probably a ground up on the way there."
"804660","810920"," This is due to the fact that the 4400 seems, we see positive gamma starting to build and deflating"
"810920","812400"," implied IV right?"
"812600","817620"," Then a support note as we discussed last night, we've seen IV is currently fairly valued and so for"
"817620","818380"," all to reduce."
"819300","821900"," It's likely to likely a drain, not a flush. "
"822960","827720"," Yesterday in the broadcast back with the VIX, VIX was trading down like 25 bucks or something."
"828040","832940"," It wasn't a lot of room for it to fall more down to that $20 level to get to 4500."
"832940","838440"," And furthermore, you'd need the VIX at like 35 for us to make a move currently where we're at,"
"838900","839020"," right?"
"839160","842640"," Maybe even higher, 36 for us to make this ripper move higher again to 450. "
"843320","844360"," Just be aware of that."
"845100","847780"," That means it would to be a slow run up to 4500."
"848740","852740"," For the downside, under 4400, there is a slipstream down lower. "
"853580","857340"," This OPEX is reducing a lot of high delta and the money puts, but it also removes a lot of"
"857340","859960"," puts less or equal to 4300."
"859960","861500"," Therefore, we think of selling arrives."
"861900","866680"," A lower bound that is that was near 4100 has moved down baby down to 4000. "
"867720","868660"," What does that mean?"
"869160","875540"," It means cheap puts got cheap means that when I was buying calls three, four days ago and selling"
"875540","876580"," out of my call positions."
"877860","883520"," Yesterday and starting to add some short positions that there's a chance that not only am I doing"
"883520","887680"," that, but so are some fucking hedge funds and banks means that people out there."
"888100","892940"," See that puts are getting cheaper that they can reposition shorts that were at an OPEX that they"
"892940","894900"," can put some slap some puts on. "
"895180","897400"," Let's say they put them on for the three months away from that, right?"
"897780","900580"," Let's say they put them on from from now right into June."
"901520","904740"," And then we have dealers needing to hedge that stuff."
"905380","909200"," And so we could drift down lower to that 400 or 4000. "
"909200","914080"," And then all you need is a waterfall of puts, not hedges, but puts to take us down there at"
"914080","916340"," some point, believe it or not before the 31st."
"916960","922140"," As a reminder, the 22 equity market low was on 224 official conflict date."
"922340","926340"," Despite the fact that both credit and commodity markets deteriorated into March, I do want to make"
"926340","926900"," a note on this. "
"928720","933320"," I can't say who, but I have some family members that are part of our military, right?"
"933780","941580"," And our government's high up and the what I've heard is you should see some resolution in the next"
"941580","942000"," three weeks."
"942280","946540"," That sure as shit would coincide with a move lower to 4000, right?"
"946720","950240"," If you saw a move down to 4000 over the next couple of weeks and then boom, you see some"
"950240","956000"," resolution to the conflict low and behold, we're down at 4000 in their cessation of wartime"
"956000","956460"," activities."
"957020","960540"," Boom, there's a news trigger for us to move this market higher. "
"961600","965640"," In summary, if we were to map up the landscape, it seems to compare well to January, okay?"
"965820","966160"," January."
"966840","968140"," There's a bit of call interest, right?"
"968640","971220"," Greater than equal to 4400, which can contain markets, black circles."
"971560","972260"," See this back right here?"
"972720","973060"," Watch my cursor. "
"973400","974600"," This is back in January."
"975340","978380"," The point they're making is that we're right right now, we're right here."
"978380","982160"," You can see even a bounce today to 4400, but not get a hot above it. "
"982380","986200"," And then boom, we make this next leg lower to 4000, so be aware of that, okay?"
"987280","991400"," So this is our big concern here that should selling pick up and hedge demand, i.e. put buying"
"991400","995520"," renew, that brings short stock demand from dealers and a resulting spike in IV with less starting"
"995520","995900"," support."
"996260","999100"," Remember, today, hedging is different than puts."
"999660","1002940"," If they slap on millions of dollars and puts in the market, it's normal. "
"1003940","1010540"," They'll be immediately thereafter hedging impact that should last like 15 minutes or so."
"1011060","1013820"," But once those puts are placed, those are hedges."
"1014200","1016060"," There's a difference between hedges and puts. "
"1017020","1022420"," If they put those hedges on and then start to cascade puts on top of those, that's like a manager"
"1022420","1023460"," saying to a prop desk."
"1023660","1029440"," I want you to get me 20 million inputs on the on SPX and throw in another $10 million on"
"1029440","1031940"," spy puts for next week, right?"
"1031940","1033720"," Top it off, put a little bit of cherry on top of that."
"1033980","1035380"," If they do that, we're in some trouble. "
"1036460","1038240"," Okay, be aware of that as we move forward."
"1038760","1040300"," Here are your levels for the rest of today."
"1040940","1041740"," I'm going to scroll through them. "
"1041740","1045260"," You can always pause this broadcast and come back so you can see where the gam and volatility"
"1045260","1047460"," levels are on your own charts."
"1047540","1052120"," We're going to move on over and I'm going to explain what was said here to you this morning on"
"1052120","1052720"," a chart."
"1053180","1054960"," Okay, turn that shit off right there. "
"1055740","1057860"," I'm going to bring this up for you right here."
"1057980","1060680"," Okay, and we're going to take a look at this chart for today."
"1060680","1063500"," Okay, see that drift lower that we have this morning. "
"1064140","1068880"," The key that Spock Emma is trying to make to you is that, hey, you know, we'll be fine, believe"
"1068880","1069420"," it or not."
"1070140","1072620"," We'll be fine if we trail down this way today."
"1072880","1075900"," We really want to be above 4,400 up in here. "
"1076120","1079680"," We want to see even if we get a catch a bounce here and move higher."
"1080100","1085980"," If we can't catch this bounce and move higher either today or Monday, I'd even give it into Monday,"
"1085980","1086740"," believe it or not."
"1086740","1093120"," But you instead of just that drift, you guys know that when when markets consolidate, right?"
"1093540","1098880"," The longer that we consolidate, the longer the chances are that we if we drift sideways, that will"
"1098880","1100720"," drift sideways and down. "
"1101060","1106680"," If we continue to consolidate and we don't see a bid in the market, a bid in the market yesterday"
"1106680","1107980"," was asked how to explain some of this stuff."
"1108280","1109220"," You want to see."
"1109880","1111840"," You have absolute gamma in a call wall, right?"
"1112000","1113980"," Or put wall and absolute gamma strike on puts. "
"1114560","1116000"," You want to press to get to 450?"
"1116620","1117940"," You want to be seeing calls to 460."
"1118700","1119480"," Remember seeing the 460?"
"1120220","1123660"," You want to see them about a month out to three months out and you want you want to see"
"1123660","1125220"," them big across the market."
"1125740","1130740"," Okay, we need that structure right for us just to get to 450 up higher here. "
"1131000","1134300"," Any of this in the money ship that's dated for the same day is weak."
"1134300","1140500"," In the moment that those calls, let's say, are closed for the moment those calls come into the"
"1140500","1143060"," money, the dealers stop hedging that stuff."
"1143440","1148500"," So unless there's more in the money day out, two day out calls, well, let's say we'll go up, but"
"1148500","1151140"," then we'll start drifting lower again, start drifting lower again. "
"1151600","1155380"," And it actually leaves the door open for hedge funds at any moment to sell this market."
"1155740","1159060"," And that's exactly what it's been going on since January 4."
"1159320","1162040"," Okay, so be aware of that as we open this morning."
"1162640","1163640"," It's now 917. "
"1164480","1169580"," So you've got your charts here, you see your support one, support two, and your R1 and R2."
"1169700","1174620"," The last point that I'll make about this chart here, okay, is the last point that I want to make"
"1174620","1175400"," about this chart right here."
"1175400","1177260"," And right back, I just got myself something here. "
"1178420","1179940"," So I got a black color here."
"1180120","1181620"," I'm going to change this over here to like a green."
"1182460","1184700"," And I'm going to do this job you over here. "
"1185680","1186940"," So I want to make the size bigger."
"1186940","1187760"," I got a small penis."
"1188060","1191640"," So we're going to make the size smaller over here. "
"1191840","1192680"," Put that one right there."
"1193360","1195180"," And I'll make a green, you know, like a green."
"1195660","1197760"," Okay, that's not really the green I want. "
"1197920","1198840"," I don't like that green either."
"1199300","1200940"," More like a yellow green, right?"
"1201140","1201840"," It's like, that's okay."
"1202240","1202680"," Okay. "
"1204740","1207080"," So we've got this band up here, right?"
"1207460","1208860"," This is a trading range, right?"
"1209460","1210740"," Big trading range here and here."
"1211660","1215200"," You can always trade below this range, but keep it up here."
"1215200","1215480"," Okay. "
"1215800","1218640"," You can always trade above that range and then come back down in here."
"1218960","1221200"," My cursor sucks over here."
"1221820","1227640"," My point though, behind this is that, my point behind this though is that we can slip down here and"
"1227640","1229000"," then let's save it. "
"1229100","1229280"," Okay."
"1229800","1234080"," So if you're a bull, you're looking to buy underneath this line if you can."
"1234280","1234460"," Okay. "
"1234780","1239620"," If you're a bear, you're looking for a rejection to take this lower before you start getting all"
"1239620","1240400"," bearish and crazy."
"1240500","1242620"," You want to take the second move here."
"1242620","1247260"," So I want you to be aware of that as we trade, you want to be able to get great"
"1247260","1250140"," positioning as we trade the rest of this today. "
"1250300","1250420"," Okay."
"1251220","1257020"," So even if you're bearish today, unless you were in puts back over here yesterday for today, you're"
"1257020","1260820"," going to be looking if you're bearish for a slip below and then a rejection."
"1261480","1261860"," Okay. "
"1261880","1266740"," If you're going to take that next short down in the market, if you're a bull, right, you're going"
"1266740","1271440"," to look for a slip below and then for it to come back up and save itself, then you would"
"1271440","1273740"," take your long from that point."
"1273960","1274080"," Okay."
"1274240","1277520"," So don't be diddling around here and don't be diddling in the middle. "
"1277900","1280100"," Don't become back to me at the end of the day and be like, Hey, cap."
"1280280","1284640"," I think we're going higher at four o'clock after we've already made this move higher or hate cap."
"1284640","1287740"," I'm buying puts now way down here because I think we're going lower down here. "
"1287740","1287960"," Okay."
"1288640","1292500"," Be aware and active as a trader when we're at these levels here."
"1292580","1297980"," This is the time for you to know and to learn how to take a short position or a long"
"1297980","1298380"," position. "
"1298380","1303460"," You want to be in before the trade happens, not after, always before."
"1303740","1303840"," Okay."
"1304080","1309780"," This is the place that you put risk on in this market for directionally, which way we are going"
"1309780","1310100"," myself. "
"1310460","1311280"," What do I think is going to happen?"
"1311620","1315960"," I think we actually trade kind of down today into the close."
"1316160","1317560"," I think we trade down this way."
"1317700","1320340"," We could trade higher to four, forty four hundred because you can't root. "
"1320460","1321700"," There's no crystal ball out there, right?"
"1322240","1326120"," But if I had to take a guess today, I think we're going to trade down into Monday."
"1326120","1331560"," And then if we make our move higher, it'll probably be Monday to that forty five, that forty five"
"1331560","1335440"," hundred or slip below to move down to four thousand."
"1336020","1339340"," I think you'll see a lot of work being done by banks and hedge funds today. "
"1340460","1345040"," There is one more thing that one more key would be that JPM has a collar on."
"1345780","1347360"," That's at four, five, one, zero."
"1347360","1347660"," Okay. "
"1347840","1352400"," So that would, that would, that would totally turn, that would totally screw up my thought process"
"1352400","1353500"," that we're heading down here."
"1353500","1353740"," Okay."
"1354340","1357200"," That's going to say that we're going to head up to forty five hundred and try to get those calls"
"1357200","1357560"," to print. "
"1357940","1362140"," And it is possible because they already got their four fifteen to print way, way, way, back over"
"1362140","1362640"," here, right?"
"1362780","1364240"," They already got the other side of their heads to print."
"1364620","1366280"," And the banks tend to get both sides of their."
"1366580","1369740"," We'll talk about a collar and how it works later today in the broadcast. "
"1370320","1373000"," Now, another, another topic here."
"1373380","1375580"," Let me, I don't know how to close this thing out here."
"1376320","1376880"," All right, there we go. "
"1377700","1380000"," Another note or topic this morning."
"1380920","1382200"," We'll talk about the JPM."
"1382660","1384880"," We'll talk about the JPM thing about Bob. "
"1385860","1387900"," I got the spy up for you here, the book map."
"1388300","1391360"," We're going to also talk about a, I got a news thing for you guys."
"1392900","1398320"," So I've now, I've now, I've now canceled three different news services because I'm trying each one"
"1398320","1398540"," out. "
"1398760","1400600"," I'm trying out some new ones that I haven't tried before."
"1401260","1406520"," So today I have a new news guy, new Charlie."
"1407140","1409140"," We'll see how Charlie performs this morning. "
"1409760","1413840"," If he is able to stand in for me or interrupt and talk, whatever he does."
"1414020","1415540"," If it's too loud, let me know."
"1416180","1418000"," But I do have him on currently, my effect. "
"1418160","1420460"," I'm going to turn him back on and reset the whole entire thing."
"1421420","1422260"," I want to see that."
"1423760","1424380"," Hold on here. "
"1424480","1424840"," Give me a second."
"1425880","1427000"," Good morning, by the way, everybody."
"1427180","1427900"," Hope you're all doing well. "
"1429240","1430040"," Let me see here."
"1430200","1433460"," We move down here and when I get the thing going on over here."
"1434060","1435820"," Put that thing back on over there. "
"1436120","1436680"," Things on."
"1436900","1437200"," Okay."
"1437700","1438920"," I think it might be too loud. "
"1439320","1442880"," When this guy cuts in though, he doesn't give really, he doesn't really give like a, he doesn't"
"1442880","1443460"," really cut in."
"1443520","1445640"," He just starts talking because I don't like that part of it."
"1445980","1450160"," He doesn't give like the, the tap or something on the microphone so that you know to listen. "
"1450360","1452840"," So like I'll be talking to these guys just going to cut me off today."
"1453520","1454640"," So we'll give him a try."
"1454980","1459360"," The other thing I didn't like about this guy this morning is I had him on for the FX hours"
"1459360","1459820"," this morning. "
"1459820","1464740"," He seemed a little bit late, but I didn't know if he was just rehashing stuff that had come out"
"1464740","1465100"," before."
"1465320","1466780"," He don't, he only starts broadcasting at eight AM."
"1467280","1471560"," So I don't know if he was like, he was updating shit that had happened at like six AM and"
"1471560","1472020"," seven AM. "
"1472400","1476120"," So we'll, we'll track him and see if he's got relevant news or not."
"1476420","1479460"," And all in all, if we try, I'm going to try two or three different more services."
"1479760","1481840"," If none of them work, we're going to go back to trade the news. "
"1482520","1484740"," But I don't, I'm pissed off at him right now."
"1484780","1486880"," So I'm like, I'm like your dad, right?"
"1487800","1488900"," I'm like your dad, right?"
"1488900","1490780"," Like your kid, like my son's out there."
"1490920","1492480"," Like Josh is like, are you winning dad?"
"1492840","1494340"," No, I'm not fucking winning right now. "
"1494740","1497020"," So I'm, but I hope to win."
"1497220","1501440"," So I'm going to keep trying my ass off to see if I can win with this news service."
"1502760","1503240"," All right. "
"1503320","1504840"," Let me see what I'm doing here in the live stream."
"1505180","1506480"," I'm going to scroll back down over here."
"1507100","1507660"," All right. "
"1508340","1511020"," I'm going to get these stock screeners out here for today."
"1511720","1512520"," I think we're ready to go."
"1512900","1514740"," So I'm going to look inside the chat real quick. "
"1516000","1517720"," I'm going to start looking at this chat."
"1517720","1519380"," I'm going to tighten this up a little bit."
"1520160","1520700"," Hold on here. "
"1521540","1524000"," And I'm going to take a look and see what you guys are saying this morning."
"1524460","1527740"," It's 9.23. We got seven minutes left until the beginning of the day."
"1528480","1530080"," Do you guys all understand how to trade?"
"1530800","1531360"," Hold on here. "
"1531440","1531880"," What am I doing wrong?"
"1532560","1533500"," Doing something wrong here?"
"1535380","1536100"," Hold on here."
"1537160","1538480"," Get some weird shit going on."
"1539620","1540760"," Can you guys see me this morning?"
"1541340","1542320"," You guys can all see me out there?"
"1545360","1546260"," Let me see here. "
"1546260","1548660"," For some reason, I can't scroll."
"1548960","1550560"," There we go."
"1551060","1551580"," Oh, yeah. "
"1551700","1552240"," Maybe there it is."
"1552720","1553020"," Okay."
"1553160","1554280"," Let's see what you guys are saying this morning. "
"1554740","1555300"," Start today."
"1555460","1556120"," Good morning, everybody."
"1559320","1559680"," Okay. "
"1560000","1560740"," So this is a good question."
"1560920","1562200"," Chan Su just brought up."
"1562640","1564820"," Discord has no delay unlike YouTube. "
"1566040","1571100"," So the one thing I want to talk to you guys about this morning specifically is I'm going to pause."
"1571100","1577420"," I'm going to mute my speaker on the discord."
"1579840","1587500"," If you have a delay on YouTube, all you do is press the two times speed and it will eventually"
"1587500","1589280"," bring you up to real time. "
"1589840","1595640"," It'll sound like I'm speaking really fast, but eventually my voice will come back to normal and you"
"1595640","1598140"," will not have a delay in your broadcast."
"1598660","1599800"," It's on your end, not my end."
"1599800","1602720"," YouTube gives like a 10 or 15 second delay. "
"1604700","1607100"," YouTube gives like a 15 second delay intentionally."
"1607420","1607760"," I don't know why."
"1607900","1614400"," Just press go down to your little cog icon, click on it, look for the speed and then within like"
"1614400","1617780"," 10 seconds, 15 seconds, it'll come to real time. "
"1618700","1620400"," Good question out there, Chan Su."
"1621920","1622820"," Discord is tight."
"1623080","1623740"," Hell, yes it is. "
"1624540","1626000"," I'm going to be away from the screen in an hour."
"1626200","1627700"," Have some automated by the dip level set."
"1627940","1628780"," Gonna be an exciting surprise. "
"1628780","1629380"," I'm back."
"1629580","1629860"," Hell yeah."
"1630000","1631080"," Desperado, good to see you this morning. "
"1631540","1632420"," Good morning, Dragon Wolf."
"1633220","1634260"," Good morning, securities."
"1635360","1636100"," Good morning, Chris. "
"1636620","1638580"," Biden and she is speaking now."
"1638940","1640700"," Yeah, that's an interesting topic of conversation."
"1640940","1642940"," We should have at some point if it gets slow. "
"1644980","1647520"," The interview is relevant to what Captain is talking about."
"1647680","1648820"," Yeah, we talked about this yesterday too."
"1648940","1650660"," Even before that interview came out, we talked about this yesterday. "
"1651880","1654280"," Spy will never go below 436 ever again."
"1654500","1654920"," Mark my words."
"1655420","1656560"," Are you winning my son?"
"1658260","1659700"," Oh, that Josh is bold. "
"1660020","1661360"," That Josh is the stud."
"1663200","1663560"," John."
"1663700","1664040"," Good morning. "
"1664380","1664660"," Mary."
"1664700","1665160"," Good morning."
"1665300","1666380"," Hope you're going to print right here. "
"1666580","1668920"," As a matter of fact, they open up my one second area."
"1669100","1669700"," Open up my brokerage."
"1681040","1682360"," I got some, I got some puts. "
"1683420","1684920"," No, Mary's got some puts too."
"1685720","1686520"," I'm a matter of fact yesterday."
"1686760","1689000"," I think we even talked about some put spreads at the belly yesterday, right?"
"1689320","1691380"," When you guys all know how to do those, we talked about them at Nazium. "
"1692000","1694000"," Every time we come to resistance level."
"1694580","1696180"," In major resistance level, you should throw up."
"1696200","1697240"," You throw in some in the money stuff on. "
"1698380","1702580"," If you haven't heard that, if you haven't heard that, let me know."
"1704000","1704800"," What is with this?"
"1705480","1706240"," Let me see if this."
"1707600","1708320"," Keep hearing. "
"1711580","1712600"," Hold on here for a second."
"1713140","1714180"," Hold on one second."
"1714520","1715100"," What am I doing here?"
"1718020","1718900"," Hold on here. "
"1721540","1722620"," Let me see what I'm doing here."
"1722620","1723660"," I'm getting kind of wonky."
"1725780","1726280"," All right. "
"1726420","1727680"," Could you do a graph on Tesla?"
"1728020","1728080"," Yes."
"1728240","1729480"," I'll bring up Tesla for you real quick."
"1729760","1731400"," I've got three minutes left into the bell. "
"1732040","1736340"," If you're a one here, Tesla, we'll bring up Tesla."
"1741160","1743240"," Bring it low up some Tesla in the background here."
"1743400","1743520"," Bam. "
"1746880","1750550"," You sound like a chipmunks."
"1750610","1750670"," Yeah."
"1750790","1751370"," It won't last long. "
"1751570","1758110"," It's showing last like, what is going on with my, I'm going to make this bigger maybe."
"1758110","1758970"," There we go."
"1759350","1759590"," Boom. "
"1760350","1760670"," Okay."
"1760690","1761850"," Now I've got a scroll bar."
"1762410","1763410"," It's you, not me. "
"1764810","1767490"," What do you guys got?"
"1767830","1768650"," Trade the news."
"1769210","1769630"," Morning all."
"1770230","1771490"," What was the issue with trade the news?"
"1772130","1774750"," Josh liked to think that spy down five or eight was a poundstopper. "
"1775050","1776270"," Trade the news was nice."
"1777490","1780450"," Only on red days on quad-witching in the last three years."
"1781810","1785750"," March 19th 2019 plus five percent December 2019, even though it was technically red. "
"1785750","1788090"," The market opened lower and closed higher."
"1789230","1789870"," Good point."
"1790270","1790470"," Yes. "
"1790570","1790950"," You have to close."
"1791210","1793390"," You were trying to explain something but we're too tired."
"1793810","1794690"," Did you do it already?"
"1795010","1795130"," Yeah. "
"1795250","1799190"," No, I haven't even written it out, but I can probably, I'm on a caffeine at this moment."
"1799250","1800010"," I'm well rested."
"1800450","1804690"," So more than likely I can explain gamma and hedging at some point this morning. "
"1805470","1806270"," No superlinks."
"1806910","1807690"," I don't know what that is."
"1807970","1809090"," Same stats for triple-witching. "
"1809970","1810430"," Good morning."
"1810710","1811670"," It's not, it's you, not me."
"1812010","1812690"," Where do you find that?"
"1812930","1814130"," You sounds like chipmunks. "
"1814290","1814330"," Yeah."
"1814330","1814390"," Yeah."
"1814930","1815250"," That's good. "
"1815370","1816490"," It won't, it won't do that forever."
"1817050","1819390"," He sounds like chipmunks before morning market."
"1820310","1820710"," Morning. "
"1820950","1821190"," Good morning."
"1821190","1821650"," Good morning."
"1821730","1822110"," Good morning. "
"1822250","1822270"," Good morning."
"1822270","1822470"," Good morning."
"1822470","1822490"," Good morning. "
"1822490","1823050"," Good morning."
"1823050","1823270"," Starfish."
"1823450","1823970"," Cowboy starfish. "
"1824150","1824330"," Good morning."
"1824450","1824630"," Paul."
"1827750","1829210"," Josh just taught shittucks. "
"1829570","1830770"," He's like the bear, man."
"1838930","1839730"," Declan S."
"1840050","1841410"," I like that name and how you highlighted it."
"1841570","1841830"," Good morning. "
"1841830","1841910"," Good morning."
"1842750","1843150"," GMM."
"1843570","1844510"," He's trying to heal the spy. "
"1844910","1847970"," He's trying to heal the spy hero positive reverse psychology."
"1849970","1852250"," It's also moving up in pre-market zoom zoom morning cap."
"1852410","1852630"," Good morning. "
"1852750","1853310"," See you."
"1853330","1853510"," Good morning."
"1853650","1853910"," Good morning. "
"1853910","1854350"," Good morning."
"1854390","1854970"," Good morning."
"1855050","1855750"," Good morning. "
"1855750","1855770"," Good morning."
"1855950","1856090"," Good morning."
"1856090","1856410"," Good morning. "
"1857050","1859230"," Hey, Joe Harper is in the house this morning."
"1859650","1860530"," He showed up."
"1861010","1861790"," That's making my day. "
"1862490","1864010"," Chase Winters in the house this morning."
"1864010","1866230"," a lot of buyers of 436 blindness."
"1866410","1867630"," I was saying, hey, Joe, long time. "
"1867770","1868870"," Hell, yeah, say hi to Joe."
"1868870","1870190"," He's been working his butt off."
"1872030","1875530"," Joe Donut has graced us with his presence this morning. "
"1876370","1878610"," We haven't seen him in these parts in some time."
"1881510","1886910"," 929, five seconds left until the bell until we get an answer today."
"1888550","1896500"," If I'm going to get screwed on my poots or not, so we'll find out here. "
"1897260","1900080"," My poots are flat right now, and I don't like that."
"1900300","1901020"," They're flat."
"1901780","1903220"," The god damn bulls. "
"1906120","1909480"," So Spy is trading up at 438.20 currently."
"1910380","1911580"," See how loud that is?"
"1912400","1914680"," See what that is, what that loud noise is."
"1915680","1916580"," In just a second here. "
"1920540","1921860"," No, it's not that one there."
"1923720","1924640"," That one there."
"1926500","1927160"," Let's turn that. "
"1927300","1927780"," Let's turn that."
"1928040","1929340"," And this guy hasn't come on much."
"1929480","1934440"," The key was talking earlier for like he was rattling it off for like an hour, just talking from 8"
"1934440","1937340"," until 9 a.m. Now I just keep hearing this boing, boing thing in the background. "
"1938220","1940340"," I'm not hearing this guy say anything so far."
"1943620","1945140"," Guy's not saying a word."
"1950420","1952760"," So the spy is sitting on. "
"1953180","1954480"," I'm going to bring this back here real quick."
"1958790","1962630"," Spy is sitting on this level of support here."
"1963630","1964110"," 4380. "
"1966610","1967870"," Opening on 4380."
"1968250","1975530"," Lower bound support is, of course, this 435, 436 or so right in here."
"1975670","1976530"," It's actually slightly higher. "
"1977510","1978790"," Let's bring that slightly higher."
"1978970","1981390"," It's 436 is this lower bound support."
"1981950","1985210"," I was covering up this other line that I had here from yesterday. "
"1986690","1988670"," So I'm going to stay in my puts at this point."
"1989310","1991230"," This is not a big trading day for me."
"1991230","1992770"," I don't typically trade this day. "
"1993170","1999470"," What I tend to do is I'll open up Finviz and I will look for companies that are on their"
"1999470","2000410"," lows for the day."
"2000650","2004610"," Spy down $2 currently at the opening bell."
"2006210","2010410"," So we'll see if we can stay in support or make a move higher. "
"2014060","2014900"," I'm looking for here."
"2017060","2018400"," Let me just a second here."
"2018460","2019520"," This is a whole new setup for me. "
"2019520","2032110"," So I'm trying to get my self-comfortable"
"2032110","2033190"," with the open."
"2033950","2036850"," Watching calls on BA this morning, they did have some good news."
"2037070","2039810"," Come on, I didn't quite remember what the news that came out this morning. "
"2039890","2041830"," They do have some calls coming out on the bell."
"2042530","2044290"," Also after the bell, Tesla calls."
"2046110","2049070"," We've got Tesla March 18, 900 C."
"2050870","2052889"," We'll take a look at Tesla and see what it's doing this morning. "
"2061219","2062500"," So you close that up."
"2067880","2074800"," I can hear somebody eating on a, I can hear somebody eating on, nope, I hear somebody sniffling on"
"2074800","2078780"," Discord right now in that room, in the Discord chat room."
"2078900","2081760"," I can hear somebody, I think they're eating like Cheetos or something. "
"2082980","2084739"," Maybe they're drinking them out and doing Cheetos."
"2087020","2088960"," Here are indicators positive on the bell."
"2088960","2091020"," We remember that this was a resistance yesterday. "
"2091460","2093280"," Not as much resistance as yesterday."
"2093699","2095420"," Up here at 890 and 900."
"2096020","2098340"," We'll take a look higher and see if we can trade higher from here. "
"2102690","2105730"," 920 has some resistance on it, but not major."
"2106590","2108090"," Just the usual with Tesla, right?"
"2108670","2111430"," 950 and then looking for 1,000 above."
"2114420","2119380"," We'll look lower on Tesla and see where support lies, where real support lies. "
"2120060","2123560"," There's some localized support, right dance, 871, 868, 50."
"2123560","2130380"," This is nice to see 848, 30 lots of buyers stepping in on Tesla this morning and 800."
"2130500","2137140"," It'd be interesting to see how OPEX works out as the day moves forward to see if we could actually"
"2137140","2141780"," see inside of a book map the plays. "
"2142280","2152080"," One note I wanted to make to this morning was that you may want to open in an options chain."
"2152080","2160680"," I'd look for March 31st and look for if any puts are placed down around that 4,000 level or"
"2160680","2161180"," 390."
"2161820","2167500"," Believe it or not, I know you don't want to believe that, but just keep an eye out for the"
"2167500","2171060"," 31st and then keep an eye out for maybe a week later. "
"2171880","2174240"," Every few hours just scroll through."
"2174740","2181020"," Matter of fact scroll through right now at the 930 hour and just check the 31st expiry."
"2181020","2184860"," Check a little bit farther out and make sure there's no puts placed already. "
"2185580","2193120"," Like no concentration of puts placed lower and then check back in every three hours or so heading"
"2193120","2202640"," into the last hour of clothes just to ensure that funds are not slipping in a move lower to that"
"2202640","2205980"," 4,000 for the 31st."
"2206160","2207240"," We don't want to catch any surprises."
"2207960","2209600"," We didn't have a capitulation move. "
"2209600","2210780"," I'm going to talk a change out of work."
"2211120","2213320"," Wainwright and this is a versus systems."
"2213700","2216020"," Stanceable VS Victor Sierra. "
"2216720","2221480"," Wainwright cutting its target on VS to $3.50 down from $5 a year."
"2222540","2223920"," Is that really loud for you guys?"
"2225800","2226280"," VS."
"2226940","2229520"," I don't know if you guys can hear that or not. "
"2232260","2240620"," Yeah, you want to look for the mat."
"2240960","2242060"," You want to look for the mat."
"2242100","2243740"," Just go ahead and upgrade it to MGM Resorts. "
"2244120","2248420"," Stanceable MGM raising its rating to a neutral from a negative rating."
"2248700","2249060"," Too low."
"2249700","2250440"," You can barely hear him. "
"2251280","2251820"," Okay, hold on a second."
"2252780","2253440"," Hang tight."
"2254280","2256220"," I got to turn him down on my end. "
"2258400","2259760"," Hang tight for just a second."
"2262280","2265440"," I'm going to turn him down on my end a little bit because he's blowing my ears out."
"2265720","2268620"," And then I'm going to turn the desktop audio up on my mixer here. "
"2269200","2270720"," We'll see how that works itself out."
"2270920","2272580"," Let me know if that's better when he comes back on."
"2277140","2277800"," Too quiet. "
"2283840","2284920"," I'm sharing my desktop."
"2286300","2287360"," Hold on a second here."
"2289770","2290730"," That one's better there. "
"2291570","2292230"," Thanks for saying something."
"2293790","2294670"," Yeah, it's kind of weird."
"2295690","2296790"," There we go. "
"2297530","2298330"," That's better."
"2305480","2306860"," Let me just a second here."
"2323080","2329520"," There we go. "
"2329880","2330580"," That should be better."
"2339220","2342660"," Watching calls on or puts and calls on NVIDIA."
"2343080","2347200"," Watching March 18th, 34, excuse me. "
"2347820","2353020"," March 18th, 245p, small money, like 80,000, 42,000."
"2353740","2354640"," Not high."
"2354640","2355780"," I'll go score. "
"2355980","2356700"," This is interesting."
"2357180","2362880"," Baba puts March 25th, 92p for $78,000."
"2363240","2364320"," We'll look at Baba next. "
"2367310","2370170"," Yeah, you can see the resistance above on Tesla here."
"2370510","2372270"," Hero indicator is positive on Tesla."
"2372350","2373750"," We're going to take a look at Baba real quick. "
"2410510","2411690"," It's just a second here."
"2443670","2445050"," So we're going to take a look at Baba."
"2485020","2486600"," Those Baba puts are interesting. "
"2486860","2489160"," We've got lots of buyers on Baba right now."
"2489420","2495440"," And I thought the trade was kind of of an odd duck, maybe because it's coming into some kind of"
"2495440","2496980"," resistance above here at 105."
"2497820","2499620"," But my price target on Baba is 120. "
"2502740","2504000"," That's an odd call."
"2504380","2504980"," That's an odd."
"2505560","2507020"," It's got a high-ago score on it. "
"2507360","2514380"," It's a March 25th, 92p for $100,000 with a high-ago score."
"2516740","2518780"," Next one is going to be Chewy."
"2531770","2534170"," Hero indicator is turning slightly negative on the spy. "
"2540400","2543000"," Keep this right around here on the spy currently."
"2543840","2545740"," See if this support can be maintained at 436."
"2547020","2549360"," And also at 437-13. "
"2552730","2554670"," Yeah, I get lots of Baba calls coming in now."
"2554770","2556730"," It just seemed kind of odd seeing Baba puts."
"2557530","2559350"," And now I'm seeing lots of Baba calls. "
"2560250","2562430"," I don't understand the Baba puts."
"2563150","2565530"," Baba puts are coming in by the buttload."
"2566450","2570070"," And as a matter of fact, they are all geared towards 120c. "
"2570570","2571530"," That makes sense to me."
"2571850","2578430"," Rather than the 90p's for March 25th, we have high-ago score calls coming in on Baba right now."
"2578930","2580970"," March 25th, 120c sounds proper. "
"2581650","2585710"," And even then I might take profit around 110 unless there's expansion on calls."
"2586710","2588790"," You can even do something that's in the money on Baba."
"2589350","2594410"," More calls on Tesla, March 18th, 1880c's, $259,000. "
"2594690","2595330"," Calls on Apple."
"2595930","2597390"," American Airlines has a high-ago score."
"2598470","2601410"," We'll look at Chewy real quick. "
"2603810","2605490"," And see how they're doing."
"2609100","2610620"," Let me see, look at Chewy."
"2610920","2613740"," Remember, Chewy got kind of wrecked. "
"2614120","2615800"," We'll look at AMC and GME as well."
"2616280","2620240"," I think I saw a price cut on GME again."
"2620900","2622260"," So we'll look at Chewy. "
"2625600","2627280"," Let's see what's going on with Chewy this morning."
"2627460","2629000"," No hero indicator on Chewy."
"2632730","2634150"," Calls on Chewy. "
"2636170","2638190"," March 18th, 43c."
"2638490","2639330"," Those are just for today."
"2640270","2642030"," Day traders trading this for today. "
"2642810","2648230"," Not seeing a lot of resistance except for right here at $45."
"2649450","2650950"," So maybe this might be a fast play."
"2651170","2656050"," If you're going to trade this and you're looking for a bounce, maybe at $40 to $45, you should find"
"2656050","2657330"," some resistance above here. "
"2657730","2658390"," Sellers above."
"2658830","2661390"," You do have sellers already stepping in currently on Chewy."
"2662530","2664330"," And I'm going to look at Chewy on a chart. "
"2666570","2668270"," 4310, it pinged right up the bell."
"2672080","2675520"," And I know that Chewy was being shorted down to the pits of hell."
"2675900","2679040"," They had a triple bottom down here, very bullish on Chewy. "
"2681160","2686080"," I think the owner made a text or excuse me, I tweet the other day."
"2686800","2688420"," He was pissed off at short sellers."
"2689380","2696300"," We talked this morning before, open that you might see repositioning in companies today being OPEX"
"2696300","2698860"," for companies have been shorted for long periods of time. "
"2699520","2702460"," Chewy has been shorted since November 4th."
"2703700","2707400"," And they are trading higher this morning off the bell."
"2707400","2713080"," They did have a quick dip down below to $41.44. And they traded as high as $43.10 at"
"2713080","2713380"," the moment. "
"2713580","2714680"," So pay attention to Chewy."
"2715160","2719580"," You might be able, this might be a nice long into, that's another thing."
"2719820","2723200"," You guys are going to be putting longs on alongside banks. "
"2724220","2726620"," I always recommend spreads on OPEX days."
"2727340","2730360"," I also recommend buying stock, not day trading it."
"2736840","2741280"," So I'm looking at Chewy right now on a larger time frame here. "
"2743880","2746200"," There could be an argument that it hasn't finished."
"2747220","2750740"," Well, no, it looks like it's finished, it looks like it's finished."
"2753620","2760910"," My price targets on Chewy would be, it looks like it's finished selling off at this point. "
"2761470","2764950"," Price targets on Chewy are going to be $47.89, maybe slightly lower."
"2766090","2768890"," First target, $46.31 or so."
"2771990","2776730"," And then I would be looking for some consolidation, believe it or not, once we hit that price"
"2776730","2780010"," target, it's going to take some consolidating. "
"2780430","2787810"," So maybe a three month call in the money spread, or slightly outside the money, maybe up to $54."
"2788650","2799060"," And then by June, or let's do a price target of June or May of, let's call it, $70, anywhere"
"2799060","2801180"," between 60 and 70 by June."
"2803500","2805820"," I'm going to mark this on my end over here. "
"2809130","2811570"," I'm going to set some alerts, you guys know about my alerts, right?"
"2812670","2813990"," What I'm looking for, for alerts here."
"2822140","2824300"," And we'll do a polyline here."
"2834780","2851550"," Let's do it, hold on, this"
"2851550","2852710"," isn't rocket science, is it?"
"2878330","2878990"," It's weird. "
"2880350","2888640"," My, uh, this is really odd."
"2891940","2898820"," Maybe we've got the wrong, uh, bring it over here anyways."
"2899300","2902100"," So my PT for Chewy is going to be about 70 bucks. "
"2902440","2905040"," It looks like it has already completed."
"2906420","2907260"," Let's see here."
"2909020","2910440"," It's like, it's all right. "
"2910840","2916360"," Spartan Nash, SP-T-N, one here, company, the subject of a headline on Bloomberg that an activist"
"2916360","2919720"," investor is looking for a change in a potential sale of the company."
"2922300","2931900"," She has up $0.70 to $31.70. Again, stock symbol SP-T-N, one, two, and then"
"2931900","2932560"," consolidation."
"2933200","2938460"," A move higher here, you might find some resistance here at 46 or so, but I would expect it to"
"2938460","2939660"," break through at some point. "
"2940220","2944920"," And then some consolidation, you'll, you want to be not by this dip, but by one dip, you'll find a"
"2944920","2945700"," dip down here."
"2945700","2955320"," So set an alert on 46.32 or so below set to the alert for creating alert for"
"2955320","2957940"," below, right?"
"2958220","2959520"," 45.84 works for me."
"2960200","2963720"," And I'll be looking to take this next, this next leg up. "
"2963980","2970180"," If this fails, right, uh, won't pick it up, but if it does consolidate for another leg move higher,"
"2970500","2972380"," price target 70 bucks."
"2973700","2976900"," Actually, make, let's make it 69.69 for the boys out there."
"2982010","2983470"," 69.69 for the boys. "
"2986190","2986870"," For chewy."
"2993860","2994860"," Can I check Kweb?"
"2995000","3000720"," Kweb won't show up well on the, um, on my charts, but I will bring it up for you to"
"3000720","3001760"," prove the point I think."
"3002020","3004100"," Sometimes, or some of these do, but some of them don't. "
"3004720","3005840"," But I'll bring up Kweb for you."
"3006040","3007860"," I noticed that Kweb has more room to run as well."
"3014420","3016680"," Yeah, Kweb doesn't really give you too much information. "
"3018440","3021140"," And I don't think that it's going to, uh, price target on Kweb 31."
"3026090","3028730"," 31 dollars first resistance, a little bit more easily."
"3028930","3030650"," I actually get some pretty decent selling up here. "
"3031010","3033310"," So $31 getting close."
"3034990","3037950"," Uh, real sellers again at 32 or so."
"3038130","3041810"," 32.04 looks like this was serious selling at $32 to be conscious of that. "
"3042490","3045870"," Next leg is 35 on Kweb."
"3049080","3053220"," We're going to look at NVIDIA as well because they're getting some, they always get a lot of cold"
"3053220","3053460"," coffee."
"3053820","3055080"," We'll take a look at NVIDIA for everybody. "
"3064520","3066820"," We're also going to make a look at some other companies here."
"3067660","3070680"," June 6th, our case got some good calls coming into it for June."
"3072680","3076200"," American Airlines has some nice calls on it into June as well. "
"3076560","3077740"," American Airlines, look at that next."
"3083110","3089910"," Spy smashing and bashing now, trading to $438.76. Hair indicators green or, you know, super green"
"3089910","3092010"," on, uh, spy."
"3092570","3096770"," You want to get to $439.50, $440 and hold. "
"3097070","3099270"," You don't want to lose $440 per spot."
"3099270","3106370"," Gamma this morning that you want to see, uh, the spy actually, uh, attain $440 and hold it through"
"3106370","3106890"," the weekend."
"3115170","3116590"," Look at NVIDIA next. "
"3122830","3130430"," Watching calls in NVIDIA March 25th, $260 and $270.C calls on S-O-X-L."
"3131290","3133050"," We'll look at, uh, American Airlines next."
"3133290","3135230"," NVIDIA's got massive calls coming in on it. "
"3135970","3137810"," It still has lots of resistance above."
"3137990","3139710"," Let's look at the resistance on NVIDIA."
"3140470","3142630"," Now, all this ice is our hidden sellers. "
"3142950","3148070"," You can see it on the right hand side here and we'll add in some add-ons."
"3148310","3153890"," We'll see if we can get a squeeze possibly out of, um, NVIDIA."
"3154470","3156950"," The one thing you're looking at here is lots of traffic right on NVIDIA. "
"3157770","3165410"," Lots of sellers, uh, the buyers want to see 300 and, uh, they're claiming that they can get to"
"3165410","3166230"," $270, right?"
"3166370","3170790"," Or maybe they're just trying to get to $260 to $270 calls."
"3171770","3179310"," So be wary of resistance here currently where we are and note that there's substantial resistance"
"3179310","3182230"," above to all the way to 300."
"3182730","3184830"," There's just some nasty resistance all the way up. "
"3185230","3187910"," Uh, not even $5.5 increments."
"3188150","3190950"," So I can $260 to $265, then $270 to $75."
"3191870","3195610"," But in here there's some hidden ice in here up to $260. "
"3203440","3205280"," NVIDIA is a straight shot right now."
"3205280","3207700"," And you guys are looking at the NVIDIA, uh, chart."
"3208660","3210280"," So that'd be a good short, believe it or not. "
"3211540","3213580"," You guys looking at that NVIDIA chart right now?"
"3214180","3221400"," Wild in the streets went from 244 to 257.96. That'd be a nice short."
"3259690","3262230"," And NVIDIA is bouncing off of resistance currently."
"3262530","3266170"," We'll take a look even closer here on a larger time frame. "
"3274490","3276170"," Gorgeous screen bar up on NVIDIA."
"3289320","3291460"," We'll look at American Airlines next."
"3296480","3346240"," You might"
"3346240","3347980"," get a squeeze on American Airlines. "
"3353890","3355150"," They're squeezing currently."
"3355530","3357350"," They went as low as 16-16."
"3357670","3359210"," They're now up to 16-63. "
"3359850","3361270"," They're at some resistance here."
"3362290","3363510"," But the accumulation is huge."
"3364210","3369870"," 134-8-2-8-3-1 to only 84-67-1-9. "
"3370950","3378230"," Before the opening bell this morning, we talked about stocks that have been, shorted, might, should"
"3378230","3378530"," squeeze."
"3379510","3384090"," And if you're long in those positions to take profit, if they are squeezing them higher this"
"3384090","3388950"," morning, if you see shorts being lifted, American Airlines starting to continue to squeeze at this"
"3388950","3389230"," point."
"3390570","3399390"," Price target on American Airlines, believe it or not, could be as high as 22 dollars. "
"3400230","3405910"," I don't know if we'll get there, but you've got 17-73."
"3407370","3415090"," 18-84, light resistance at 1990, and then possibly as high as 22 dollars."
"3415390","3417390"," Lots of calls on American Airlines this morning. "
"3418570","3421430"," June 16th, 18c is one of them."
"3424660","3428100"," June 17th, excuse me, 20c, $35,000."
"3432300","3433920"," We'll look at Arc-K as well. "
"3435220","3437340"," And we'll look at planned PL."
"3437340","3440340"," Let's look at PLA and I haven't seen that come up at all."
"3448280","3467140"," PLA and it's an"
"3467140","3467840"," interesting one. "
"3468300","3474340"," So there's more, way more sellers on PLA and then there are buyers."
"3474860","3479780"," So you got 15,858 sellers to only 41."
"3482260","3483320"," So wait, I have that wrong. "
"3483520","3484300"," So scratch that."
"3484820","3490720"," We've got way more buyers than we've got sellers on PLA and we've got some weird, not weird, but I"
"3490720","3498680"," just don't normally see calls here on PL and so it's, it's May 20th, 50c in the money calls."
"3498840","3509020"," The real sellers are higher at 54.59. So take a look on a chart at PLA and in a"
"3509020","3510320"," plan, they're cranking right now too. "
"3510620","3512360"," They're, they're green-biring it straight up currently."
"3513680","3523450"," Matter of fact, they start, they started out two days ago at 42.80 and"
"3523450","3525070"," they're, they're currently green-biring it up."
"3525210","3526610"," They've been made, they started back here. "
"3526610","3529890"," They actually had a capitulation move back in November 24th, Chocker."
"3530510","3532170"," And they've been trading higher."
"3532550","3534090"," Matter of fact, this is a kick-ass stock trade. "
"3534930","3540170"," I have never traded this stock, but to open up a year long or a six-month chart on it,"
"3541210","3542730"," there's been some great buys in here."
"3543330","3544010"," This is like a killer."
"3544350","3547890"," Like if you check this chart out right here, this is a great chart. "
"3548270","3550090"," So check out PLAN plan."
"3550890","3552090"," Now they're moving higher right now."
"3552090","3562060"," Again, there was a, there was a"
"3562060","3564740"," bull on here, getting some wonkiness. "
"3574100","3579400"," Here's somebody talking, saw a hair woman talking in Discord."
"3582760","3586440"," So yeah, American Airlines and Vidia, Billy baby."
"3587280","3597120"," Someone brought up Billy yesterday, DAL Delta Airlines, April 14th, 40C, $1.6 million, S-O-X-L,"
"3597400","3604340"," March 18th, 37C, $90,000, and Vidia calls out the fucking door, like DAL calls out the door,"
"3604460","3608640"," American Airlines calls out the door, just loads and loads and loads. "
"3611770","3619590"," Where's that PLA, PLAN, May 20th, 50C, $1.5 million, PLAN."
"3628140","3630300"," Are those Russians talking on the stream?"
"3632600","3633220"," I've got like Russians."
"3635200","3636320"," Oh, no, they're Russians. "
"3643130","3644110"," No, this is not Russian."
"3654720","3664460"," If you guys hit him, we're going to look at"
"3664460","3665480"," XBI."
"3669940","3684150"," Okay, XBI,"
"3684150","3690840"," can anybody in terms of what they're saying?"
"3690940","3691240"," I want a hair. "
"3692820","3695200"," I'm like, ooh, I can't, I don't understand what they're saying."
"3703800","3707560"," No hair indicator here, blue skies above 9240."
"3708240","3710040"," It might be at a resistance point here. "
"3710220","3713560"," Oh, there's some hidden sellers right in here at 9291."
"3718920","3722420"," And then real sellers are above at 9580 on XBI."
"3728400","3729520"," Look at that smash. "
"3740770","3748030"," And we just had the release of the existing home sales for the month of February, down 7.2%. And"
"3748030","3753030"," the leading economic indicators for the month of February, up 0.3%. That was in line with"
"3753030","3753350"," expectations."
"3754490","3756090"," Just smashing on XBI."
"3763140","3765840"," PLA and still green barring it up. "
"3766200","3767740"," Billy is just green barring it up."
"3768060","3769180"," Someone brought up Billy yesterday."
"3771500","3772380"," Let's bring it back up again. "
"3782480","3783260"," Ooh, baby."
"3789980","3791700"," Get a price target on Billy."
"3797970","3799870"," Boy, you might be able to go high on this one. "
"3802450","3804550"," Yeah, way more buyers and sellers on Billy."
"3804730","3807230"," Keep an eye on Billy to 3462."
"3811670","3815090"," It's already traded as high as 2625. "
"3816110","3817670"," Green bar straight up off the bell."
"3818790","3821010"," Way more buyers than sellers currently on Billy."
"3821690","3823750"," Get 1287 to 691. "
"3824990","3827010"," Call flow coming in on it as well."
"3827250","3834290"," Price target 3456, if it can make it up there, that you get clear skies basically to that number."
"3834950","3839890"," You got some congestion here, but still mostly buyers versus sellers on Billy. "
"3841110","3842230"," Gorgeous morning, right?"
"3843010","3843810"," Gorgeous morning."
"3845330","3851210"," Despite now trading the 3922 currently, here indicator is still very positive."
"3851930","3854690"," You want to see this expansion of calls in the market. "
"3854690","3861610"," This is very good to see at this time of the day, but just be conscious of companies that are"
"3861610","3867370"," trying to take profit or release shorts on tickers that they may have held since November or"
"3867370","3867830"," December."
"3872500","3883910"," The more calls on Tesla calls on"
"3883910","3884830"," MU as well."
"3884990","3885490"," We'll look at MU. "
"3886670","3889150"," That's a favorite of some of you guys out there."
"3894800","3895880"," So MU."
"3908280","3911280"," You got three times the buyers versus sellers. "
"3911680","3915940"," One, two, three, three times the buyers versus sellers on MU currently."
"3921820","3923360"," MU is green borrowing it up."
"3923440","3924960"," It bounced down below at $78. "
"3926000","3927760"," Keep an eye on MU real quick."
"3928020","3930520"," It is green borrowing it straight up currently."
"3931300","3940940"," Price target on MU looking for $89.95 and then a hard bounce off 100. "
"3941720","3945080"," Currently trading at $79.78. I don't know if it gets that high."
"3945420","3951660"," I mean, I'm not sure if it's going to get that high, but if the buyers keep coming in on"
"3951660","3956820"," MU, would not shock me to see it trade that high, believe it or not."
"3958460","3966820"," They had a capitulation move back here on March 15th down to $68 trading to $80 or $79.80 currently"
"3966820","3967420"," at the moment. "
"3967760","3970400"," Call flow on MU as well."
"3986520","3987740"," You guys want to look at Amazon?"
"3988980","3992140"," I'll be back to read your chat just a moment here."
"3992320","3997000"," I'm trying to trade myself and look up these tickers as they come in. "
"4010620","4017440"," Get a nice paying off $440.07 on the spy here."
"4019280","4023640"," Gorgeous pin strike above almost exact."
"4024920","4031180"," Want to see if spy can now trade higher and find some support at $4,400. "
"4031800","4038760"," So we'll take a look back here on the spy and see if there's any resistance up above here."
"4040600","4042140"," I'm not seeing any resistance."
"4042760","4047940"," Maybe you guys are here indicators still positive. "
"4048280","4049360"," It's rolling over slightly."
"4053740","4058080"," We'll look to see $46,000 to $46,60."
"4058720","4060700"," Some call sellers in here currently on the spy. "
"4063810","4065410"," Price target above is $4,480."
"4066530","4072750"," If it can get there, there's a little bit more resistance above here at 441.21. So we'll see if"
"4072750","4074530"," it can hold here and trade higher."
"4115109","4121210"," More calls on NVIDIA, a firm, XOM, Baidu, more NVIDIA. "
"4122050","4124090"," Also see a golden ticket on Fiverr."
"4124090","4125149"," So we'll look at Fiverr."
"4125229","4129569"," After the golden ticket in Fiverr is April 14, 70c, $1.3 million. "
"4130830","4140950"," And we'll check out our ceiling"
"4140950","4143870"," on Amazon."
"4152140","4161100"," Amazon is now trading at $3,158.17. And there are more sellers currently stepping in on Amazon"
"4161100","4165200"," currently at the moment."
"4165200","4168560"," You're going to look for support at $3,147. "
"4169240","4171740"," And next price target being $3,178."
"4172540","4175680"," Here are indicators starting to roll over slightly on Amazon."
"4176700","4177840"," A little bit of a bounce here. "
"4178040","4180439"," You're going to be looking for another bounce down here for it to move higher."
"4188050","4188810"," It's not duck right."
"4189310","4190390"," It's not really showing well. "
"4190550","4193250"," Amazon is not showing well if it can move next to its next target."
"4193830","4194370"," $3,180."
"4195150","4195930"," We'll look even higher here. "
"4196750","4200090"," Ultimately a price target of $3,200 on Amazon."
"4200550","4204690"," If it can keep itself up here, still a lot of sellers on Amazon currently."
"4208260","4209920"," That's going to be a difficult one to get higher. "
"4210360","4213420"," But if it does get higher, there could be a nice squeeze coming up here."
"4214000","4216000"," I'm looking at a longer-dated chart."
"4216200","4218740"," I'm looking at a six-month chart on Amazon. "
"4218980","4220360"," It looks very bullish, believe it or not."
"4221260","4230760"," If you can get a squeeze higher on Amazon, your price target might actually be $3,300."
"4231020","4231700"," $3,382. "
"4232520","4234020"," Pretty much higher, actually."
"4238140","4239000"," Way higher."
"4239680","4241720"," I don't know if we can get up that $3,300 mark. "
"4242400","4244440"," Next target where you got $3,250."
"4245200","4248780"," And then you've got $3,200, of course, to contend with and $3,180."
"4252560","4258610"," You might get a nice squeeze here. "
"4259330","4262270"," It shouldn't be trading this high with how many sellers there are."
"4263110","4266450"," So I'm going to expect that Amazon continues to squeeze."
"4272040","4274080"," By our utility, we'd look at Fiverr, right?"
"4274300","4275940"," Fiverr had a golden ticket committed on it. "
"4276100","4278020"," S.D. has calls coming in at a high algo score."
"4278620","4280300"," April 22nd, 175C."
"4280400","4286140"," If you guys aren't watching the call flow in the Discord, I do recommend that you do tune into it"
"4286140","4289180"," because there is some flow coming. "
"4289340","4291080"," It's an excellent call flow across the market."
"4291080","4298540"," The market is catching an advanced bid today that is crazy big."
"4299280","4304520"," Now, I don't know if that is just to take profit off of takers that have been shorted to hell,"
"4304740","4308400"," F-V-R-R, and we're going to do Fiverr next. "
"4325950","4329210"," If you look at a six month chart on Amazon, it is bullish as all fucked."
"4329430","4331450"," That thing could just keep ripping, believe it or not."
"4337460","4338840"," That's not Fiverr, is it?"
"4340420","4341440"," That's Fiverr. "
"4342680","4343720"," Fiverr, same thing."
"4344020","4345640"," Take a look at a Fiverr chart right here."
"4347460","4353440"," Fiverr, like a six month chart on Fiverr, just looking to monster rip it up here. "
"4354060","4355040"," Monster rip it up."
"4357790","4360910"," Bounce off of 66 this morning, now bouncing off 7170."
"4361790","4366980"," Price target, $75 on Fiverr. "
"4371620","4372940"," Gorgeous chart on Fiverr as well."
"4375940","4377540"," I'm going to go back to Tesla."
"4382750","4384070"," Spy now moving higher. "
"4386920","4387660"," Ooh, yeah baby."
"4397960","4398840"," Ooh, yeah."
"4400140","4400860"," Dude, we've got takers. "
"4402060","4411900"," Anything that I'm looking at, a my end that has been shorted is short to being lifted across the"
"4411900","4412100"," market."
"4412880","4415520"," Just blast off time, straight blast off."
"4425360","4426220"," Come on. "
"4441160","4452420"," The roof on Spy today, price target of $442.50, possibly"
"4452420","4454300"," even as high as $4430."
"4459940","4463000"," Hair indicators start to turn slightly down on Spy."
"4463240","4469120"," Just be conscious of this move down from, you can slowly see this move down. "
"4469120","4473060"," Hair indicators getting weaker, but even so."
"4493380","4496060"," More calls coming in across the board on Tesla."
"4496860","4503420"," March 18, 900c, $25 million, $200,000. "
"4504260","4506400"," Blanket calls on the queues."
"4507740","4513480"," March 18, 348c, you want to see this as a bull for this market here."
"4513900","4516900"," A little bit of a roll over currently in the Spy, a little bit of rejection here. "
"4520560","4529270"," I had some calls that are $2 now they're down to $1.74. Now they're down to $1.64. I"
"4529270","4531750"," had some, I have always still have 440c's."
"4532650","4533850"," Still trading 440c's."
"4534370","4536590"," Two days in a row trading 440c's. "
"4557640","4559880"," Who's chatting on someone's chatting on Discord?"
"4561560","4562760"," And here that is."
"4569420","4571240"," See if it can catch a bounce here off 440."
"4571720","4573520"," This is where the Spy wants to be. "
"4574120","4576980"," We talked about this yesterday and this morning for bulls."
"4577380","4581700"," They want to maintain 440 to open the door to 4500."
"4582160","4590320"," If they can't maintain 440, can you see a break below 438, 436 somewhere in there?"
"4591180","4593100"," Then that would open the door down below to 400. "
"4600860","4606720"," Also take note of the VIX is now trading down to its prior support from yesterday."
"4607880","4612480"," Down to a retesting 2525."
"4612840","4614220"," So keep an eye on the VIX currently. "
"4635290","4636930"," VIX is at 2532."
"4637530","4639050"," Another seven pennies to go."
"4639810","4647950"," We'll see if there is a third bounce for a rip higher or if we start to break below that"
"4647950","4660240"," 25.25. 1016"
"4660240","4660880"," in the morning. "
"4662040","4666220"," A little bit of a rollover in the market currently looking at the VIX starting to settle in for a"
"4666220","4668000"," moment to see which direction it's going to take."
"4668480","4672140"," If the VIX takes a bounce, we should see some weakness overall across the market."
"4672900","4676800"," We do also have some call or we have lots of calls on RK. "
"4682780","4686740"," See his resistance point here and Tesla also matching up to the VIX."
"4694400","4701720"," We're going to look at RK and then we're going to also look at Ring actually."
"4703480","4705020"," Let's take a look at Ring first. "
"4771060","4772840"," Ring catching up outs here."
"4773420","4776020"," They were as low as 2860."
"4778690","4782250"," Tag 2993 had calls come in on Ring. "
"4785380","4787000"," I don't know if it was a golden ticket."
"4793780","4795540"," Also some calls coming in on gold."
"4796860","4799320"," Then we'll take a look at RK as well. "
"4816920","4824940"," RK green bardage straight up from 6162 to 6597 showing a bull flag again."
"4825140","4826940"," We'll see if that's will hold up here."
"4827580","4831380"," Still watching calls come in on RK this morning for June. "
"4836380","4839620"," Anything being shorted today, the shorts are coming off at the moment."
"4840400","4842600"," It doesn't mean the shorts won't be put back on."
"4842600","4847820"," Just be conscious of reversals if they could happen end of day into the close. "
"4848280","4853300"," If you've been upside down or under the water on any of these tickers and you are right side up,"
"4853300","4855980"," it is also a good time sometimes to take profit."
"4857260","4859040"," As these plays may be short-lived."
"4863410","4868790"," Let's take a look here at RK finding some localized support at 65. "
"4870230","4873230"," Look for a bounce off 6505, maybe slightly higher."
"4873910","4876770"," They got rejected above here at 66."
"4878390","4887990"," Next price target above would be 6769 and then thereafter the concentration at 6920 and"
"4887990","4888450"," 70. "
"4891880","4893400"," Big salaries at 72."
"4895220","4898640"," A little bit more rollover."
"4898920","4900040"," We're going to keep this. "
"4900140","4901660"," We're going to go back and see if it can hold here."
"4902400","4903900"," Then a lot of you guys like Ring."
"4904380","4907620"," So look to see if we can catch a bounce off 65 for RK. "
"4909000","4913880"," Look to see if we can catch a bounce and a bounce higher off $65."
"4914520","4918980"," Or if it's just another opportunity to reshort Kathy Woods ETF."
"4919680","4922180"," We'll just take a quick break here and just watch. "
"4922620","4924940"," Also watching calls on SPX."
"4926120","4931420"," SP500 April 14th, 44, 25 baby, 2.8 million dollars."
"4931560","4934000"," Woo hoo April 14th. "
"4937840","4940000"," I sold some 440 C's."
"4940580","4942440"," Now they're down to like a dollar 18."
"4943060","4946260"," They're up to two dollars at one point they've lost half their value. "
"4951540","4975120"," Do you"
"4975120","4980820"," have set four, three, eight, six, four, four, three, eight, six, four."
"4982900","4988650"," So make a note of that in your charts on the spy."
"4995630","5002050"," Hard support below on the spy at four, three, seven, seven, three or intraday support. "
"5005190","5007210"," Or is that four, three, seven, seven, nine."
"5046160","5049980"," A little bit of a bounce here on the spy squeezing higher."
"5080770","5082590"," I'll bring it over here and watch this bounce here. "
"5083210","5084690"," This is where VWAP is right here."
"5084890","5089670"," This is where this is VWAP and I believe this is where that red support is on the spy."
"5090270","5092450"," Quick bounce here on the spy. "
"5092770","5093630"," So I can show you guys that."
"5095050","5095890"," Quickly as possible."
"5097090","5098410"," See if this can hold. "
"5098410","5103890"," You got one, two and three and we'll see if this third bounce can trade higher."
"5117420","5119420"," Sorry I'm actively day trading this."
"5120260","5121800"," So I want to make sure that I'm making money here. "
"5123320","5125220"," All right, let me check your."
"5142920","5145020"," So I didn't see what Z had said."
"5200140","5203720"," So I'll bring this chart back up for you so you can see it here. "
"5208840","5210280"," One, two, three, four."
"5210540","5211680"," We'll see if this holds up."
"5212140","5214740"," You do want to see the spy hold up. "
"5216160","5220040"," There is a high concentration of calls still on that 440 C."
"5235530","5284800"," New low of the day on the VIX 25.02 calls coming"
"5284800","5291320"," in on Caesars Entertainment CZR and then calls again on spy March 18, 441 C for $100,000."
"5293590","5301640"," G-R-O-M, G-R-O-M, April 14, 2.5 C, $22,000 high algo score."
"5337240","5344440"," Nice little squeeze on Grom, G-R-O-M, traded as low as 79 cents now trading at $1.47."
"5349340","5354340"," Had some calls come in on Grom, April 14, 2.5 C for $22,000. "
"5354960","5366940"," A little bit of a resistance at $2,000,"
"5367020","5372220"," price target above of $2.70. Slightly more sellers than buyers, but it is squeezing."
"5373680","5380340"," I'll bring it over for you guys and see it here on another chart here."
"5381580","5387860"," Just a huge push down monster volume. "
"5390740","5392160"," Another bull flag."
"5403240","5412080"," If you can grab another touchdown here at $1.42.09 and the price target $1.78 again, $1.80."
"5412240","5414920"," We'll take a look and see if there's resistance there."
"5416280","5416760"," None. "
"5418900","5419120"," Nothing until."
"5419380","5424260"," It's a little bit here at $1.60, but if you break through there, $2 is not out of the"
"5424260","5426320"," probability."
"5428920","5459800"," Grom, G "
"5459800","5461780","-R-O-M, moving higher currently. "
"5474180","5476040"," Spy kind of diddling over here."
"5476520","5478880"," Not really doing what you want to see it do right now."
"5479760","5485140"," This consolidation here, I don't like seeing this roll down. "
"5485580","5489120"," We'll look to see if this has changed any bit down."
"5489200","5491820"," I'm looking to buy in again, but I'm kind of cheap."
"5492060","5496660"," I want to buy it down here at $4.38.67 or down here at $4.38. I don't know"
"5496660","5498860"," if I'm going to get that chance or not. "
"5503070","5504010"," Excuse me, I've got to try mine."
"5504110","5504370"," Hold on."
"5513510","5514970"," I'd really like to buy it down here. "
"5515250","5524700"," If we could do something like this and then"
"5524700","5526420"," move higher, it'd be kind of nice."
"5528100","5532920"," Or even something like this, this maybe, and then that."
"5533360","5536520"," Something like that I'm looking for, but I probably not because I want that, I'm probably not going"
"5536520","5536920"," to get it. "
"5537580","5539320"," Watch it be, oh shit, what do I do?"
"5543710","5548510"," I really want to, I want to grab this right now for this next leg up, but I think it's"
"5548510","5548930"," going to roll."
"5549690","5553790"," So we will see if it rolls or not."
"5554490","5556770"," Someone did buy some apple cod or some spy calls. "
"5556930","5557750"," They bought 100 grand worth."
"5558930","5560330"," Apple puts coming in a little bit."
"5562740","5564100"," What else do I see down here?"
"5564680","5569680"," CPMG, March 25th, 21C for $93,000 high algo score. "
"5572100","5573240"," The UPST, baby."
"5573600","5577840"," I know you guys like UPST. So what I'm looking for is, I want to show you what I'm looking"
"5577840","5585780"," for, is for this tag, do we get this tag slipped down below, bang off 43771, and then we've seen"
"5585780","5592300"," some more buyers step in for the real money is right down here, 437, 437 and a half. "
"5592680","5594400"," I don't know if we're going to get that though."
"5594760","5596540"," I doubt we even trade that low down here."
"5596540","5599340"," There are buyers at 439 stepping in. "
"5599700","5600740"," They're going to try to push it higher."
"5603710","5612330"," Probably going to miss in this one because I'm too greedy."
"5620060","5621580"," Okay, so you guys have some questions, right?"
"5621680","5622560"," I'm going to wait on this trade. "
"5622660","5623440"," I'm not going to take another trade."
"5624080","5626420"," Okay, so I see Zach asking a question."
"5627040","5631180"," So Cap asked earlier, and I know you're busy, but wanted your thoughts on holding debit put spreads"
"5631180","5631940"," from last week. "
"5631940","5636060"," Had a phone call for a couple minutes and hope I didn't miss your response."
"5636820","5639100"," I don't know what the question is on spreads."
"5639720","5642840"," Let me know what you're holding when you buy them. "
"5643140","5647760"," Like the day you put it, like the day you bought them, the price you bought them at, and what"
"5647760","5648400"," they actually are."
"5649020","5650480"," Are they like a debit puts?"
"5650780","5651620"," Are they credit puts?"
"5651880","5652860"," Are they credit calls credit?"
"5653120","5653940"," Are they bear bubble?"
"5657260","5659360"," They all look at Palantir right now as well."
"5659500","5666040"," I know you guys like Palantir, so we'll take a look at it. "
"5666040","5668040"," So if you could, Zach, if you could just let me know."
"5676270","5677690"," Yeah, Palantir with a little bit of a rollover."
"5677790","5680190"," Yeah, it's in a nose dive, but it was at 12 bucks off the bow. "
"5681230","5682510"," So we'll take a look at it right now."
"5684270","5692150"," That is one thing to note about OPEX is there's a bunch of stuff going on, right?"
"5692230","5693830"," So we discussed this before the open this morning."
"5694290","5703030"," The first thing would be that the key is that you've got positioning for the past three months. "
"5703430","5709270"," We saw that we have tickers this morning that have been shorted since November, and we're in March,"
"5709310","5709570"," right?"
"5709730","5710950"," So they're wrapping up these positions."
"5711270","5716750"," So if I am a big bank and I've been shorting Palantir down since, as a matter of fact, Palantir"
"5716750","5718190"," has been shorted down since when?"
"5718430","5722930"," Since, well, do a long time, right?"
"5723830","5724610"," Long time, wait a minute."
"5724610","5725930"," Again, all kinds of fucking here. "
"5727630","5728250"," Hold up."
"5731450","5738930"," So Palantir has been shorted since September and enforced in November, which we see a lot of these"
"5738930","5744550"," tickers have been like heavily shorted and it's been for this whole entire quarter, right?"
"5744770","5751230"," So you let off these shorts, you take profit, and then for this one day it squeezes, right?"
"5751970","5757170"," Now the question becomes when it squeezes, are they going to re-short hair, right?"
"5757350","5758650"," Do they re-short hair or do they not?"
"5759430","5762730"," I don't know that they do re-short hair in some of these tickers."
"5762850","5767710"," Some of these tickers have been shorted to help, and so they might be switching their positions too"
"5767710","5774570"," long, but it is concerning because when you get out to, they might lift the shorts up from now into"
"5774570","5778470"," 3 p.m. and then re-short again, right?"
"5778690","5780270"," They might re-short your favorite ticker. "
"5781250","5786990"," Even though Palantir is rolling over, I'm not sure that it is done going up for the day, nor other"
"5786990","5787410"," tickers."
"5787910","5792190"," Shorts have come off and they're going to want a better price too short, your favorite ticker, or"
"5792190","5793470"," take it long once again."
"5793690","5794470"," We should look at Roblox. "
"5795030","5796150"," Don't wonder if they've pulled the shirt."
"5796270","5797490"," I haven't even looked at Roblox this morning."
"5799490","5802710"," Let's get some price targets above for Palantir. "
"5803550","5805270"," Here indicator is beautiful on it."
"5805870","5807150"," I've got plenty more sellers and buyers."
"5807450","5809210"," You've got some localized support here at 1040. "
"5809210","5814270"," Next target above, 1745, baby, 1745."
"5815150","5816370"," A little bit of resistance here."
"5816570","5818150"," This is more short covering rally too. "
"5818530","5824470"," Don't be thinking that this is like full-stower, full-stepping in craziness, but if they continue"
"5824470","5828870"," to let go of their shorts, you would have a price target above of $18."
"5834940","5836080"," So we'll take a look and see."
"5836420","5842000"," If you want to buy a dip right now on Palantir, it shows 10, but we'll see if there's anything"
"5842000","5843960"," sitting in here, any kind of ice. "
"5845220","5848540"," Looks like you've got some hidden right where we are right now, like 1260."
"5849800","5852120"," Got some more buyers down here at 1230."
"5852960","5857180"," And then some more buyers at $12 and at 1180. "
"5861360","5862860"," What was the other one that I said I was going to look at?"
"5865980","5866720"," Tesla 80."
"5869620","5872700"," Her agent puts at 441 again, looking for that 438."
"5875640","5878760"," The Palantir is a nosedive, you low and longer bearish cab. "
"5879440","5883260"," Be sure to my know your long-term bullish, 451, 450."
"5884340","5892040"," King cow, today is FOMC, I don't have to say it's OPEX, so it's not really the question for the"
"5892040","5892260"," moment."
"5893040","5900260"," This morning we discussed what actions should take place today because it's OPEX and we are"
"5900260","5901400"," experiencing those actions. "
"5902700","5905500"," 441 for different spreads for May 20th."
"5906520","5910260"," Okay, so Zaki bought 450, 41 spreads for May 20th."
"5910320","5910880"," When did you buy them?"
"5914400","5916480"," I don't care about Darius Dale, I'll be honest with you. "
"5916760","5918300"," I like him, but I don't care what he's saying."
"5919040","5923040"," He's made some really bad fucking calls past few months, to be honest with you quietly between you"
"5923040","5923240"," and I."
"5925540","5929020"," I like him, I shouldn't say don't like him, but I'm not really listening to him currently."
"5930560","5936400"," We should discuss Darius Dale's take right now in the market, and bring it back up and we'll"
"5936400","5937320"," discuss Darius Dale. "
"5940940","5943360"," 451, 450 puts spreads for May."
"5943460","5944400"," Zaki, when did you buy those?"
"5949390","5951150"," Spy, continuing to fucking sell off."
"5951810","5953350"," Holy shit Spy, I'm getting my wish. "
"5953950","5957310"," Let's talk about this right here real quick because I just said I didn't want to buy Spy yet."
"5958030","5960970"," I was like I'm going to pass on re-entering the Spy and look where we're going."
"5961330","5964370"," Bam, bam, right?"
"5964890","5967110"," I said, I don't want them out, don't like buying this here. "
"5967110","5968450"," I'm going to wait and see what happens."
"5968890","5971730"," And then I think Cowboy Starfish is like I'm in puts right now."
"5972590","5976010"," And I think Josh was like, yeah man, I'm waiting for that dip bite too. "
"5976070","5977530"," Some of you guys out there know about this shit."
"5977730","5980630"," So now we're coming down into this localized support."
"5981310","5988910"," We want to see if, or I want to see, I'm going to now take a look and see if"
"5988910","5990350"," we catch this bounce down below here. "
"5990350","5991870"," This is the VWAP we talked about."
"5992290","5996310"," This is that first, what am I doing here?"
"5997650","6000450"," We're going to take a look here below."
"6001290","6002210"," And what do we always say, right?"
"6002370","6003630"," The smart money is down here. "
"6003690","6008730"," Smart money's like, yo man, I'll buy that shit dog, but you got to bring it down here like $4 "
"6008730","6014030",".37.80. Sometimes they'll swing up and grab a little bit."
"6015390","6019550"," But this is where you're like, hey, if you're looking at a regular chart, you're like, you're like,"
"6019690","6021170"," hey, I'm going to buy this right now, Cap."
"6022470","6024050"," I'm buying this right here. "
"6024050","6026750"," And meanwhile, there's some prick down in here."
"6026990","6029210"," And he's like, nah dog, it's coming way down, bro."
"6029450","6030370"," Send it down here to me. "
"6030850","6032710"," This is where your fishing expedition happens."
"6032870","6038130"," I'm not saying that's going to happen here, but sometimes you get that bam, quick move down, and"
"6038130","6040470"," you're still fucked in some picking up some calls over here."
"6040890","6043110"," So I'm going to wait, I'm still waiting a little bit here. "
"6043170","6045590"," I want to see if this rolls over, just a little bit more down in here."
"6046230","6047590"," I'm going to get that little dip bite out here."
"6047870","6048390"," Are we kind of nice?"
"6048770","6051230"," I'm going to grab this for another run for another 100% play. "
"6051890","6052550"," We'll see what happens."
"6054390","6055530"," Bring it on down to daddy."
"6055990","6057010"," Bring it on down here. "
"6057950","6061250"," Bring it on down, bring it on down, bring it on down to daddy."
"6062290","6065410"," Bring it on down to daddy so I can get a dip bite."
"6070010","6071290"," Bring it on down to daddy. "
"6073230","6076010"," I wonder if we should add so far two days ago."
"6076130","6077130"," I'll bring up so far for you guys."
"6077490","6083120"," Two days ago, I didn't gem say not to be sure. "
"6083320","6087800"," I haven't looked at it with anything that gem said, but just so you all know, I haven't paid it"
"6087800","6088620"," to any attention to him."
"6088620","6091560"," He blocked me and I blocked him like three, six months ago."
"6091680","6093520"," We're going to a big fucking fight, a big Twitter fight. "
"6094180","6097500"," He came into my thread and started talking shit, and then he was wrong."
"6098360","6099580"," And I was fucking right."
"6101060","6105100"," And so he blocked me because he fucking thinks he's right all the time, and he ain't always right. "
"6106540","6107360"," That's true story."
"6109360","6113120"," I think it's a true story, how it happened."
"6113320","6117100"," And I remember how it, I remember he came into my fucking, some thread I posted was like, that"
"6117100","6118080"," didn't happen and it did. "
"6119140","6119960"," And so he blocked me."
"6122580","6123700"," Something like that happened."
"6125400","6127820"," You know, as I get fucked buddy, and it's not really get fucked. "
"6128020","6130660"," It's that shit changes in the fly, right?"
"6130780","6132200"," You already know that shit changes in the fly."
"6133100","6135360"," And he was like, he's on his fucking stump or something."
"6135820","6136420"," I like him. "
"6136600","6136980"," Don't get me wrong."
"6137120","6137520"," I like gem."
"6138640","6139740"," He does has great content. "
"6140560","6142800"," I got nothing, nothing to nothing ill towards him."
"6143340","6145120"," But I don't follow him or he blocked me."
"6145540","6146220"," I don't know. "
"6146920","6148400"," He's not the only one that's blocked me."
"6150540","6154460"," Some of the big types, I'm telling anybody like Tesla bulls with like one million, but not all of"
"6154460","6154660"," them."
"6155360","6157460"," Like Merit or Sawyer Merit hasn't blocked me. "
"6157520","6158100"," I love that guy."
"6159160","6164340"," But there's a few big bulls and bears out there that have blocked me over the years because"
"6165740","6168600"," everyone has different motivations in this market."
"6169140","6172500"," And everyone has different. "
"6174320","6175540"," Everyone has different."
"6178440","6184720"," Not just what you see, you've got different motivations and then you've got different objectives,"
"6185400","6186860"," even if you're a bull or a bear."
"6187300","6189140"," You have different objectives. "
"6190220","6197160"," So sometimes I feel like bulls get trapped and bears get trapped in there."
"6197920","6199000"," With the wrong crowd."
"6200380","6203260"," It's got a negative hero indicator here on SOFI. "
"6204120","6206360"," More buyers and sellers currently in SOFI."
"6212410","6213830"," It was awesome, right?"
"6213990","6214550"," So I've had a great day."
"6214750","6216310"," 878 sprung up to 948. "
"6216590","6217990"," We talked before the open this morning."
"6218330","6220630"," You might find your position long or short."
"6221870","6227770"," This morning before open, I said you might find your position look better today at some point. "
"6227970","6233850"," So if you were short or long in a position, today might be the day to take profit on whatever"
"6233850","6235250"," that position was, right?"
"6236210","6238350"," So if you bought at 770, you're in the clear."
"6238710","6244210"," If you were long at 770, let's say you were long at 12 bucks on SOFI, I'd hold on."
"6245070","6245830"," It should spend so far. "
"6245950","6248310"," It's been shorted down since November 11th."
"6248370","6249050"," Another ticker, right?"
"6249490","6250790"," It's been shorted for four months."
"6251570","6253970"," So you have shorts being lifted currently on SOFI. "
"6254450","6255770"," Does it trade hires the question?"
"6256510","6256950"," I don't know."
"6257230","6258650"," Can it go down below 8 bucks?"
"6258650","6259190"," Probably."
"6260470","6262150"," But shorts are off right now. "
"6262150","6263910"," Does it have a chance to go up over time?"
"6264170","6264650"," Probably."
"6264810","6270850"," You have to check to see if long calls outside of the money for April, May, June have been picked"
"6270850","6271150"," up."
"6271470","6276230"," Or if this is just shorts covering until they can get a better price around the close. "
"6276950","6283010"," So if you're long on SOFI, if you're upside down, maybe on SOFI, I don't say to you."
"6284590","6290450"," But it's the fact that it's been shorted since November as a high probability that they're going to"
"6290450","6294450"," long this, at least into April or May or June."
"6294610","6299770"," You can see the reversal in the high volume going back to March 14th. "
"6299850","6302710"," So one, two, three, four, five beautiful days for SOFI."
"6303190","6304570"," I'd say it's making a trend hire."
"6305530","6307050"," I'd say hold if you were a bull. "
"6308130","6309090"," That's what I would say."
"6309850","6310730"," Good place to buy."
"6311850","6313190"," I mean, SOFI was wet. "
"6313370","6317950"," Got beaten down from because like 40s or so, it was just 20s."
"6318070","6319350"," I thought it was higher than that at one point."
"6320150","6320490"," Nope. "
"6320690","6322430"," The high in SOFI was 28 bucks."
"6323530","6325190"," The low was 778."
"6325510","6326150"," Sounds about right. "
"6327230","6329110"," Lower than it's open."
"6329610","6331250"," Or it's offering."
"6331690","6333770"," It was offering was at $10 and 10 cents. "
"6334150","6335430"," Yeah, I think it's a good buy down here."
"6336230","6337090"," I think it's a great buy."
"6338070","6339470"," Even at 9.21, I think it's a great buy. "
"6339850","6341470"," I think it's a great buy at 7 bucks or 8 bucks."
"6342190","6346790"," And then what I always tell people, if they don't have diamond hands, I always say create two"
"6346790","6353490"," accounts and go and you day trade one account and you fucking just buy and don't look at it on"
"6353490","6354050"," another account."
"6354710","6356890"," And then set some alerts when you really want to take profit. "
"6357170","6358930"," You're like, hey, I don't want to sell SOFI until it hits 30."
"6359530","6360650"," Okay, so set a line at 30."
"6361090","6361650"," Put an alert on it. "
"6361730","6362510"," Have it alert your phone."
"6363050","6365170"," And don't look at it for the next year, two, three years."
"6365490","6368890"," And then you'll get a beep one day that says, hey, boss, we're ready. "
"6369550","6370590"," And you can take profit."
"6370590","6375650"," I don't think I would set an alert at $28 on SOFI, but I'd set an alert like 19 maybe"
"6375650","6377510"," and just forget it."
"6378170","6379070"," Don't look at it. "
"6380710","6381630"," All right, hold on."
"6384090","6386450"," We've got the spiders over here fighting for its life."
"6387430","6392950"," SB 539, 8, bounce down below here at 437, 438. "
"6394750","6398570"," Look to see if it can regain some of its luster and trade higher here."
"6398570","6401670"," Here are indicators heading higher currently on on SPY."
"6401770","6403250"," Looks like dip buyers are stepping in. "
"6403690","6405490"," There are some spy puts coming in currently."
"6406110","6408090"," Spy March 18, 439 P."
"6410090","6413610"," $147,000 me watch the Tesla call screen right now."
"6413610","6417010"," March 25, 950 C, 322,000 dollars. "
"6417290","6420450"," More calls on airlines like that airline trade."
"6420750","6422870"," That reopening trade is on board right now."
"6422890","6426730"," Just heads up the trade for the casinos is open right now. "
"6426730","6428850"," You might even want to look for the Disney trade."
"6428870","6434230"," Any of these reopening trades looks like some of these hedge funds and banks are going long."
"6435070","6436310"," So we'll look at Diz real quick. "
"6436530","6437490"," Probably already made it move this morning."
"6437650","6438750"," I haven't taken a peek at it."
"6440430","6444270"," But we'll take a look at Disney because I'm sure that Disney trade is on too. "
"6444450","6447350"," Someone asked about Disney yesterday or the other day."
"6447390","6451450"," We're going to talk about those 450 debit call spreads as well in just a moment here."
"6452890","6456310"," Hey, you can see Disney caught a bid going back to the 14th again. "
"6457150","6458310"," Hasn't lost its bid."
"6460210","6461630"," That's turning around right."
"6462150","6468090"," You can see that Disney lost its shine because it was reorganizing basically. "
"6468750","6470570"," I don't think it was really wasn't really negative."
"6470570","6472350"," It was just going to take some time right there."
"6472430","6475470"," Short down from 203 down to 130 bucks. "
"6476210","6477850"," Do I think Disney can trade lower?"
"6478750","6481370"," They traded as low as $129."
"6483510","6484810"," Can I trade lower?"
"6485230","6485330"," Yeah."
"6487030","6487470"," Yeah. "
"6487490","6491810"," My price target on Disney is somewhere down around $109, believe it or not."
"6494370","6496870"," But maybe that leg down is after summer."
"6497050","6502750"," Maybe they're going to give them a chance for an ER trade saying, look, we opened everything up. "
"6502890","6503830"," Everybody's partying at Disneyland."
"6504870","6508290"," They had a nice voluminous buy on Disney."
"6509710","6511610"," There's a nice volume on Disney actually. "
"6515900","6516340"," Yeah."
"6516500","6518200"," So they came in and bought it in January."
"6518200","6521260"," And they came in and bought it again in March. "
"6522240","6523860"," So yeah, I like Disney here."
"6525940","6527520"," Price target on Disney in the June."
"6532240","6542100"," $154.15, $154.15, believe it or take a look here and"
"6542100","6542320"," see. "
"6544460","6548000"," There's $145, $150."
"6548960","6550160"," That's going to be a tough one to get through."
"6550740","6551780"," Think about Disney, too. "
"6551880","6554880"," You can't really buy a weekly son of a month."
"6555040","6557200"," You just have to buy spreads on it and just hold it for three months."
"6557980","6560620"," And $155 is my PT on Diz. "
"6565790","6567030"," Let's take a look back on the spy."
"6567610","6568370"," See if it's recovered."
"6571020","6571740"," Disney got a nice bounce. "
"6575850","6576510"," I didn't buy that bounce."
"6576710","6577030"," I should have."
"6584860","6587840"," Man, they just drained the value off of calls. "
"6588540","6591880"," All the premium just got sucked right out of the calls right now."
"6592660","6595380"," Even though it's heading higher right now, there's no premium."
"6596980","6604900"," Those 440 C's are now down to $1.18, $1.17, $1.16. And it's fighting for its life right"
"6604900","6605120"," now. "
"6605740","6607560"," You know, the spy is definitely fighting for its life."
"6609400","6613520"," A little bit of distribution going on currently in the spy just heads up, okay."
"6614140","6617340"," A little bit of a death cross on here for what I call a death cross. "
"6618040","6618580"," I was caught."
"6618820","6620580"," We say that I have two different death crosses."
"6620840","6621640"," You got the golden crosses. "
"6622080","6622940"," You got the death crosses."
"6623740","6625640"," These kind of a fucking things right here."
"6625780","6628380"," This is like a distribution pattern right here, right?"
"6628660","6632360"," Down up lower low or it looks to be lower high, right?"
"6632700","6637120"," Lower low lower low or this is the first lower low lower high lower high. "
"6637540","6639560"," And not always sometimes he's recovered."
"6639840","6641640"," But oftentimes you'll see like this."
"6641960","6642280"," Hold on. "
"6642280","6644000"," See this big move up here, right?"
"6645360","6647980"," Bam, bam, bam, bam."
"6648180","6649720"," This is where the shorts come in, right?"
"6649900","6652280"," And they go, this is where the short is."
"6654180","6655300"," It's actually right here. "
"6655780","6657260"," I'm not saying this is going to happen."
"6657400","6660700"," I'm saying too that you don't take the first one."
"6660780","6662100"," You take the second and the third one. "
"6663200","6673020"," You can see calls a little bit of a ween on the, on the you'll see what you'll"
"6673020","6673660"," see right here."
"6673820","6674500"," You'll see it happen."
"6675240","6676660"," See a little bloodbath going on. "
"6677940","6680040"," Little bloodbath in the spy happening currently."
"6682920","6684360"," I'm going to shoot him up and kill him."
"6685580","6686200"," Die, bull. "
"6686400","6687360"," Die, die, die, die."
"6689500","6691260"," And we'll see if it trades lower."
"6692660","6696640"," Didn't quite get that lower lower again, but you should see some capitulation down here. "
"6696780","6698180"," We'll see if we can get it down into here."
"6699000","6701960"," See if old man Captain Jim James can grab up dip by down below here."
"6704740","6705800"," You guys seeing that?"
"6706060","6707460"," You guys watching that happen?"
"6710240","6711560"," Almost there, baby. "
"6712140","6713040"," Almost there."
"6713300","6714420"," Cowboy starfish still in."
"6714560","6721940"," He's looking for that dip down to 4.37. Nice old puts earlier. "
"6722220","6722700"," Jumped in calls."
"6724940","6727300"," Let me see just for healthy chart reason."
"6729120","6732260"," Okay, so we're going to talk about some 450Cs real quick too. "
"6732440","6733420"," Oh, look at that dip by."
"6734960","6736400"," Look at that dip by."
"6736400","6737800"," You see that right there?"
"6752880","6753980"," I'll play ball on that. "
"6755740","6756860"," I'll see if that holds up."
"6760500","6762240"," I've got an order in for right down here."
"6762480","6765820"," So I've got a little standing orders waiting to see if I can grab these for like 70 cents or"
"6765820","6766080"," so. "
"6768520","6774920"," Okay, so we're going to talk about some 450Cs for May and they were bought a couple days ago."
"6774920","6776660"," Let's see, they're bought down in here."
"6788240","6789800"," Yeah, man, 450 in May. "
"6790200","6791320"," Just stay in those bad boys."
"6792340","6792740"," Just hold."
"6793760","6794620"," Yeah, worries. "
"6795820","6796900"," Yeah, no worries."
"6803690","6806110"," Give me some calls for like 60, 70 cents."
"6810580","6815200"," The only time I take profit on debit calls for, there's a thought process on debit call spreads. "
"6816080","6817060"," This is the thought process."
"6817380","6821900"," Okay, when I buy debit call spreads, not this is not the timing of buying them, but when do I"
"6821900","6822380"," call profit?"
"6823200","6828880"," I call profit at if I get 50% profit in the beginning of the trade."
"6829300","6830400"," So it doesn't matter how long it is. "
"6830480","6838420"," If it's three months or if it's a week, if I get 50% almost immediately, usually for me to"
"6838420","6842280"," get the other 50% is going to take me until they expire."
"6843140","6847480"," So if that is, let's say I get, let's say boom, I had 50%, anywhere from 35 to 50%"
"6847480","6848340"," profit on a call spread."
"6848940","6854520"," If I hit that, not always, but oftentimes I won't get the full 100% until they expire. "
"6854840","6864340"," So I can make better money closing those spreads at 35, 50% and then renewing"
"6864340","6865940"," a new set of call spreads."
"6867620","6873220"," And they will usually print another 35 to 50 before they would have expired."
"6873220","6875540"," So let's say about a three month call spread. "
"6876360","6881900"," And I print 35% or 50% in the first three weeks or a month."
"6882860","6892540"," If I close them for profit at 35 to 50%, then I will reenter more spreads for whatever"
"6892540","6894580"," direction or wait for a dip, right?"
"6894760","6899120"," And let's say I take new call spreads for one to three months out."
"6900200","6909920"," As that original three months had passed, I could capture 65 to 50% of profit in only two months"
"6909920","6915320"," rather than waiting on the first trade for the full three months to grow up to 100% profit. "
"6916020","6925160"," So what it does is it leaves me time to enter two, possibly three trades in that time period and"
"6925160","6926840"," actually make the 100% profit."
"6927320","6928620"," I don't know if that makes sense to you out there."
"6929680","6933900"," Zach, but I tend not to hold to the end now. "
"6934740","6938840"," Other banks and hedge funds and traders, they hold shit right to the bitter end."
"6939500","6943100"," But I don't have the ability to have stuff closed."
"6943300","6947740"," Now, if you do hold something to the bitter end, I want you to also realize that when you get"
"6947740","6953660"," to the end of that debit call spread, there will be a moment where they will come into almost 100 "
"6953660","6955760","% just before the expiration. "
"6957020","6963280"," Sometimes they'll be worthless, they'll go to 35 to 50% then they'll drop down to like zero and"
"6963280","6967580"," then they go right back up to like 97% right before the expiration or on expiration day."
"6967680","6969460"," You take money and you close that out."
"6969600","6972720"," Never let them ever let them expire, ever. "
"6974000","6978560"," And another thing is like today was dividend day or yesterday or overnight was a dividend day for"
"6978560","6978780"," spy."
"6978980","6984440"," You don't ever want to be dealing with the spy with spreads on dividend day as well."
"6984440","6988240"," That's another risky thing because you can get assigned when dividends come out. "
"6988400","6994560"," And then the last point would be when you sell them, there's better times of the day to sell and"
"6994560","6999000"," buy spreads depending upon how busy the market is."
"6999280","7001900"," I tend to try to buy spreads when it's quiet and sell them when it's busy."
"7002560","7004760"," Like when people need to buy, people need to buy on Mondays. "
"7005240","7008920"," So I try to get rid of spreads on Mondays if possible."
"7010520","7014420"," So there's all that involved as well involved in that trade as well."
"7015020","7018520"," And the last point that I would make is that let's say you put a spread on and it it"
"7018520","7020740"," doesn't print you 35 to 50%. "
"7021260","7025540"," That is when I will hold a spread into into expiry."
"7026060","7029400"," So if I get a spread, some people don't like doing that because they're afraid they're going to get"
"7029400","7029680"," assigned."
"7032480","7038140"," But oftentimes I will hold a spread diamond hand that shit right to expiry. "
"7038140","7043080"," Well, I won't hold it into expiry but like the day of expiry because they do have a high chance"
"7043080","7047780"," of printing at some point rather than closing them early like it was in profit early."
"7050990","7051770"," Let's see here."
"7053650","7054490"," Ooh, yeah, baby. "
"7054690","7055170"," I'm making some money."
"7057810","7058430"," Ooh, yeah."
"7058830","7061850"," I mean calls, by the way, on 440 Cs. "
"7062410","7068390"," I bought that little deck down there that you saw that little pin strike down here."
"7069210","7070690"," I scooped some calls up down here."
"7072860","7074840"," So we will see where it trades to. "
"7076860","7081180"," Let's see if we can make it up to 440 72 would be the price target if it can get"
"7081180","7081480"," up there."
"7082460","7085060"," We've got more buyers here, indicators turning green again."
"7086900","7092160"," So we'll see if we can tag above looking for 440 70 on the spy. "
"7093040","7094120"," Another maybe 20-point move."
"7094380","7094960"," Hopefully we can get that."
"7096500","7099800"," We have a price target change out of Barclays in the shares of SBA Communications. "
"7101400","7108320"," SBAC, Barclays cutting its target on SBAC to 373 down from $376 a share."
"7109200","7109840"," SBAC."
"7132290","7133830"," Nice movement on the spy. "
"7134250","7135850"," Nice little push higher on the spy."
"7138720","7141600"," I'm making some serious fucking money today, I gotta say."
"7143580","7145400"," Making some good fucking money today. "
"7149200","7151400"," Yeah, no worries."
"7153800","7158120"," Oh, hold on, 451 if you were to have a spread."
"7158680","7164790"," Well, you've got put spreads from a 20th, huh?"
"7167950","7169150"," Yeah, you hold a spread. "
"7169410","7171490"," So the thing, all right, let's talk about spread."
"7171670","7172690"," This is a good question, actually."
"7173750","7178750"," Because I talked about this and I talked about this this morning and I said, I will discuss this"
"7178750","7179510"," later this morning. "
"7180310","7183590"," And what I wanted to discuss was the JPM caller."
"7184130","7185930"," So we're going to discuss the JPM caller."
"7186270","7189870"," We're going to get into a quick chit chat about collars. "
"7190270","7195930"," Now the fucked up part about collars, well, there's a whole thing about collars that are put on by"
"7195930","7196170"," banks."
"7196390","7200870"," Number one, there are more profitable ways for banks to do things, but they've been doing them like"
"7200870","7203810"," this for so goddamn long that you can't, they won't change their ways."
"7205510","7212370"," Now this also hedging also comes into this as well, and believe it or not, it doesn't matter"
"7212370","7218130"," sometimes if they never come back to print the other side, but oftentimes, oftentimes, I'm going to"
"7218130","7219510"," show you guys some real quick here. "
"7219890","7223960"," Okay, I'm going to show you guys something here."
"7224160","7232440"," So oftentimes what you'll do is you'll see, I'm not shitting here at all."
"7232540","7237240"," So what you'll often see, okay, is you'll see a bank on an OPEX. "
"7237720","7244260"," You'll do is not like, let's go back to an OPEX here, but we'll do like this, this is what"
"7244260","7244740"," they'll do, okay?"
"7250930","7257750"," They'll take a spread, be like 451, let's say, and then let's say 410 or 415 down here, right?"
"7262420","7263960"," They'll put a spread on the market, right?"
"7264340","7266920"," So, or they'll put some hedges on, right?"
"7267040","7272680"," They come down here and they print all this shit down here, and then they'll try to come back up"
"7272680","7274100"," here to print the other side."
"7277640","7279040"," This actually is a good example."
"7279340","7280920"," I'm going to show a better example of this, hold on. "
"7284700","7285880"," How do I show a better example?"
"7286240","7287640"," Hold on, let's say I'm going to get rid of this stupid shit."
"7290230","7297550"," So what ends up happening is you get, how are the problems of my stuff here?"
"7298690","7300010"," Hold on one second here."
"7311830","7319690"," So what ends up happening here is you get a caller gets put on, right, and so let's say, let's"
"7319690","7322410"," say I don't know which direction the market is going. "
"7322570","7326830"," This is a good example because right now we're standing right on this right here."
"7326890","7332590"," If you're JPM, you're going to try to get one side of your caller to print, and the other side"
"7332590","7333890"," of your caller to print, okay?"
"7333890","7337590"," The lower and the upper end of your caller is currently even holding."
"7338210","7344530"," But today's OPEC, so the OPEC's, the thought on OPEC say would be that JPM is going to put another"
"7344530","7350310"," caller on, so they're going to be looking at an implied range for the next three months, so they're"
"7350310","7353450"," going to want to protect themselves, you know, just theoretically they're going to want to protect,"
"7353590","7357770"," protect themselves with downside to 400, and they don't want to protect themselves in the upside,"
"7357850","7363090"," let's say to 480, right?"
"7363090","7364910"," To 480, right?"
"7366030","7370830"," And they put a caller on higher and lower today, and they don't need to make a fucking decision as"
"7370830","7371730"," to which way the market goes. "
"7371830","7376890"," Let's say Goldman Sachs says fuck, by the way, there's a bunch of calls coming in the market, and"
"7376890","7381770"," calls on Apple spy, NVIDIA, Neo, NVIDIA again."
"7382950","7388250"," So let's say you see, let's say that that's caller on, they're like, I'm going to put a caller on,"
"7388250","7393810"," they'll probably put it on at like 480, but they might throw it on for like 460, 450, 480, whatever"
"7393810","7395310"," they do, 480, let's say in 400."
"7396230","7403870"," So what they'll do is the market will move in one of those two directions, and as they print one"
"7403870","7411430"," side of that trade, they will end up taking the long or short side of whatever side of that trade"
"7411430","7417380"," didn't print, so it did print, so let's say they print the 415s, right?"
"7418000","7422520"," Let's say JPM prints the 415 side of their caller, right?"
"7423040","7430060"," They will then cash that in, take that money, enroll it into ensuring that the upside of that"
"7430060","7431540"," caller prints heading higher. "
"7432020","7432600"," Does that make sense?"
"7433260","7438340"," So then they'll be buying that, they'll be selling that the low side or the short side of that"
"7438340","7439600"," caller, right?"
"7439920","7445680"," For profit, take all that money, and then they load it in at the same time that the hedges are"
"7445680","7446760"," coming off from market makers."
"7446760","7452180"," So you've got the de-hedging from the market makers, then you've got JPM big power mover being"
"7452180","7458020"," like, boom, I'm buying double now to go back to 450, let's say."
"7458280","7462720"," And so we trade higher into 450, now we're way up there at 450, now our 480, or whatever it"
"7462720","7465260"," is, their next caller is going to be, and what do they do?"
"7465740","7470980"," They're going to cash out the original caller that they put on three months ago, and the trade to"
"7470980","7473280"," 450 at the same time, right?"
"7473440","7474620"," And guess who gets left with those bags?"
"7475120","7475680"," Retail traders. "
"7477040","7483560"," And so you're buying those bags, or big money brokers like Carl Eichen or Bill Ackman try to fight"
"7483560","7484500"," each other on those things."
"7484860","7489180"," That's when you hear about liquidity being, that's when they step in, when we need liquidity being"
"7489180","7490560"," provided to the market."
"7491200","7495260"," What they'll do is they'll get a big baller in and they'll sell some guy like JPM, not a guy,"
"7495380","7499440"," but a company like JPM be like, hey man, hey, Carl Eichen, this is what I did. "
"7500400","7503300"," I just, I just banked on 400 Ps."
"7504100","7510040"," I need you to provide some liquidity to these retarded bears to buy these puts, because they think"
"7510040","7510780"," we're going down to 350."
"7511600","7515800"," And so Carl Eichen steps in and goes, here's your puts, here's your puts, here's your puts, here's"
"7515800","7516900"," your puts, right?"
"7517140","7518160"," Provides liquidity to the market. "
"7518800","7523360"," Meanwhile, JPM's cashing out, Carl Eichen sold you a bunch of puts."
"7523680","7528260"," Meanwhile, Carl Eichen just went long in the market, and JPM just went long in the market, and the"
"7528260","7531400"," market just rips higher at that point, and you're getting fucked sideways."
"7532480","7533580"," So that's what my point is. "
"7533700","7538420"," So the, how about that means though, for you, if you're buying long or call spreads or put spreads,"
"7538420","7543340"," there are three months out, there's a fat chance or put spreads, there's a fat chance that in that"
"7543340","7547180"," three month period, you're going to see a swing high and swing low where we're both sides that"
"7547180","7557200"," trade prince because of, because of the collars that are put up by JPM, calls on spy SPXU, let"
"7557200","7566480"," me see, SPXU, SPXU 41416Cs, $35,000, $4,000 a sweep and a split, calls on spy March 21,"
"7566760","7576040"," 445C for $59,000, spy calls March 18, 440C, $57,000, spy calls March 18,"
"7576240","7579020"," 441, $36,000."
"7579560","7582660"," Now I'm not happy at all with this fucking news service."
"7583640","7585900"," So I'm going to have to cancel this bullshit too. "
"7587300","7589360"," I'm pretty pissed off at this news service."
"7589780","7591180"," I'm going to have to go back and trade the news."
"7592040","7592760"," They are the best. "
"7592940","7595080"," I know that they're the best too, which is the sad part."
"7595640","7598300"," I've used them on and off for many years."
"7600100","7603040"," And even there, even their text news kind of sucks. "
"7603080","7604840"," I'm looking at it over here on the side."
"7604840","7605940"," It's just not that good."
"7606800","7607740"," It's kind of shit. "
"7609980","7612580"," I don't know how I should start my own news."
"7612840","7613500"," So you know what I should do?"
"7613900","7618520"," I'm at a point right now where I'm spending like almost $20,000 a year on services."
"7619220","7624020"," And I'm like, man, I'm like, I could just get a fucking Bloomberg terminal and start selling these"
"7624020","7628980"," fucking, because Bloomberg's got a thing called like, I think it's BBS Q or something. "
"7629860","7633320"," They have their own news service that's actually faster than trade the news."
"7634020","7636040"," And I could just fucking sell that shit."
"7636360","7637760"," You just start my own sell the news. "
"7638160","7642340"," I'll just call the news out all day long and make thousands and thousands of dollars."
"7642640","7644020"," I could probably do something like that."
"7646760","7651600"," Not that I'd want to call the news out all day long, but other than a other than a Bloomberg"
"7651600","7653460"," terminal, I'm learning that the best. "
"7655530","7656490"," The best."
"7659430","7660450"," Let me look at it here."
"7661850","7662350"," The best. "
"7670090","7671410"," I don't want that one."
"7673610","7677230"," The best news services tend to be nope."
"7677390","7678170"," I don't want that one either. "
"7678990","7679750"," And that one down."
"7681530","7683290"," It tends to be Bloomberg."
"7685790","7686950"," No, I don't want that one either. "
"7689270","7695710"," That's not the one right there, right?"
"7696670","7697830"," No, it's not that one."
"7697950","7699090"," It just turned that one off."
"7704100","7705400"," Nope, not that one either. "
"7705940","7706680"," It's right here."
"7708240","7709240"," Bring that over there."
"7715090","7715930"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"7716150","7719150"," Look at those calls printing price target above."
"7720670","7725330"," Called it earlier, 4, 4, 4, 0.76. We're almost there."
"7726170","7726550"," Take profit. "
"7736410","7737690"," It's a quick 50% scalp."
"7739250","7741290"," It was 80 cents now trading to 146, 147."
"7744090","7745010"," Gorgeous trade. "
"7746270","7747550"," Outstanding trade on the spy."
"7755810","7758630"," Yeah, I don't know what the fucking sound effect is in the background."
"7761150","7761950"," Hold on a second. "
"7768630","7770170"," I put the baby up."
"7770490","7775410"," I put the baby down for a nap and the spy rips the same with I miss what you guys"
"7775410","7775950"," are saying here."
"7780140","7783220"," So how much is good money for you?"
"7785220","7787860"," Okay, so Hutch is asking how much is good money for me. "
"7788160","7792320"," So my setup costs me just my hardware, right?"
"7792540","7794700"," So far this year, just my hard year hardware this year."
"7795160","7796820"," I've got, I'll count it off."
"7796940","7797940"," I'll add it up right now. "
"7799840","7800980"," So I just got a new setup."
"7801500","7803600"," I want to save six months ago and I've been adding to it."
"7804320","7805420"," So I just read like re. "
"7805860","7812540"," So what I did this past year, this past fall into winter was I got a setup that I could"
"7812540","7813100"," travel with."
"7813360","7820520"," So wherever I go, I can travel with four to five screens, a couple laptops, and I can trade"
"7820520","7821700"," anywhere I want in the world."
"7822980","7825460"," I got a super dope backpack and I"
"7829270","7845690"," can"
"7850010","7850770"," just 20. "
"7859810","7868490"," Okay, so my trading setup right started out at about $4,000, my new trading setup"
"7868490","7873930"," with the peripherals and all the other stupid shit maybe maybe maybe slightly more of it like four"
"7873930","7874190"," grand."
"7874510","7884070"," Then I just added just added another $5,000 to"
"7884070","7885390"," the setup."
"7886130","7891790"," Now my home rig and the cameras and the lights and all that other stupid shit that you guys don't"
"7891790","7892270"," see in the background. "
"7893210","7893910"," It's like 10 grand."
"7894770","7900230"," And then my services are costing me anywhere from 16 to $20,000 a year."
"7901110","7902610"," So Hutch just asked me. "
"7903270","7907810"," So if I just paid, I shouldn't be disclosing this stuff."
"7908270","7911270"," So if I just paid like nine grand on a setup, right?"
"7911810","7917030"," My new setup is like nine grand and my services are running almost right close to 20 grand a year."
"7918070","7918890"," What do you think?"
"7919750","7921310"," How much is good money for me?"
"7921490","7929270"," What do you think I need to make trading for that after paying taxes and after losses and after?"
"7930370","7931710"," What do you think good money is?"
"7936590","7942470"," I'm probably going to turn this new service off for the day and I'll just get trade the news again. "
"7944650","7946250"," So what does it cost me to trade?"
"7946750","7950490"," It probably costs me what a lot of people make in a year."
"7950670","7951110"," Not a lot of people."
"7951310","7955110"," You know, like some people probably don't make 30, 40 grand in a year. "
"7955570","7957810"," You know, not everybody makes that with a regular job."
"7961050","7964470"," So if that's just my, just my cost of doing business."
"7965170","7968770"," As a matter of fact, yeah, that includes my internet and all that other stupid shit too. "
"7969730","7971930"," So I'm going to turn that boing bullshit off."
"7973750","7975650"," So yeah, so do I have a chance?"
"7976870","7978970"," So like, how much, what's good money?"
"7981390","7982250"," It's hard to say."
"7983190","7984290"," There's ups and downs. "
"7985090","7986390"," One day last year."
"7987810","7990210"," So one day last year, this is a true fucking story."
"7991010","7993630"," I've told this story a couple times, but this is a true story. "
"7994170","7995350"," One day last year, right?"
"7995490","7995730"," I lost."
"7996010","7997510"," No, maybe it was two years now."
"7997510","8001690"," Time has time passes for a couple years, maybe maybe like two years ago. "
"8002510","8006170"," But last really large loss was a couple years ago."
"8007290","8009670"," I want to say it was two or three years ago."
"8010250","8012910"," I took a bearish trade and I kept adding to it. "
"8013330","8018490"," Long story short, I like told my loved ones to leave the house."
"8018630","8021030"," I was like, you guys all believe this true story."
"8021030","8021810"," I'm like, you have to leave. "
"8022430","8025210"," And so they left and I shit you not."
"8026450","8027650"," I shit you not, right?"
"8027910","8030730"," I took my office chair and I broke it into little pieces."
"8031610","8036750"," And then I smashed my desk into little broken pieces and then I dragged it all outside and I saying"
"8036750","8037350"," fucking trading. "
"8037970","8042030"," And I think I stopped trading for like three months, maybe one to three months I stopped trading"
"8042030","8043810"," because I was so fucking angry."
"8045450","8047350"," So there's losses in there too over time."
"8047950","8053050"," So you have to, you might be like, Oh yeah, you're a ball, you're making all this money, but you"
"8053050","8057330"," know, you take like six figure hits and they're not fucking pretty. "
"8058730","8059790"," They're not fucking pretty."
"8060070","8062110"," And matter of fact, it's mostly the mental side of it."
"8062410","8065270"," Like the mental, the mental like that shit happens. "
"8065370","8066690"," It is not fucking pretty."
"8067390","8069570"," So we're coming into some resistance here you can see on the spy."
"8070030","8073290"," If you are in spy calls right now, it's probably a good place to take some, take some profit off"
"8073290","8073630"," table. "
"8073910","8077330"," You can pick it back up above $44.95. We called this just a few minutes ago."
"8077810","8079010"," We are now trading at 440."
"8079450","8079650"," 40. "
"8080150","8081470"," We called this at 447."
"8081890","8085250"," You got 30 cents left on this trade on the spy."
"8086330","8088550"," Those calls are now to a dollar for 58. "
"8088770","8094470"," I got out of $1.46 or something, $1.44. I should have stayed in, but take some risk off"
"8094470","8094830"," the table."
"8100230","8103550"," Yeah, you guys know I don't have a job, right?"
"8103930","8105750"," You guys know I'm out there working a job."
"8105970","8109930"," It's like I'm doing this eight hours a day and then going on a job somewhere at nighttime and then"
"8109930","8111010"," coming back and seeing you. "
"8111670","8114650"," So it's not like I got, I'm not a trust fund baby or anything."
"8115590","8121930"," I do roll money into real estate so that I don't want to ever work for the rest of my"
"8121930","8122170"," life."
"8123050","8126090"," And you know, I will be honest with you, I started with nothing. "
"8126270","8133290"," I think I started with like, I think I started out with like 500 bucks and I lost it and"
"8133290","8137010"," then I started with 1,000 and then I lost it and then I started with like another 1,500"
"8137010","8139870"," and then I lost it and 200 then I lost it."
"8140010","8144750"," It probably took me three to four years to be consistently profitable."
"8146550","8151670"," So don't, if you're not profitable, you just have to, you got, you always hear like 90% of trader"
"8151670","8152310"," traders fail. "
"8152550","8153030"," I'm going to tell you why."
"8153790","8154710"," I'm going to tell you why."
"8155310","8156310"," It's because they don't keep at it. "
"8156850","8158450"," You just keep losing money, right?"
"8158750","8161350"," And over time, you will fucking learn."
"8162510","8163470"," You will learn."
"8163830","8169150"," You will make rules and you will abide by them and whenever you don't abide by them, you'll say, oh"
"8169150","8173010"," fuck, I broke my own rules and you'll start making money again. "
"8174090","8176510"," So it's just about sticking with it, the longer you stick with it."
"8176610","8180190"," And also, dumbing shit down is makes me more successful."
"8181170","8186250"," The smarter you become as a trader, the stupider you become as a trader, I believe, 100% believe"
"8186250","8186530"," that. "
"8187610","8191950"," The smarter you think you fucking are, I know I'm going to take your money away from you."
"8192190","8192950"," I know I am."
"8194350","8196610"," Know I'm taking my money, your money away from you. "
"8197170","8198010"," Believe it or not."
"8198650","8203610"," The smarter the trader that you are, usually it's more of a, you learn that over the years to the"
"8203610","8206790"," longer you trade, you'll figure out, you'll be like, I got to dumb this shit down."
"8207190","8210090"," I think I'm over here fucking falling down the rabbit hole, I'm not going to name names. "
"8212030","8214709"," But you'll be like, oh yeah, that guy sounds so smart out there."
"8215110","8219469"," You guys are fucking rocket scientists and then you fucking figure out that he's just selling you"
"8219469","8224809"," some shit, selling you a program, a subscription, he's selling you a course, he's selling you a"
"8224809","8227790"," website, he's selling you, or he's not even selling you."
"8227910","8232570"," Like some of these guys, like I see these young guys on Twitter and they sound so smart and in"
"8232570","8237910"," reality, they just got a finance degree and they're trying to make a name for themselves in the"
"8237910","8245209"," finance community so they can get a job from someone who they think works at GS and they disappear"
"8245209","8247450"," like six months a year later, whatever. "
"8248110","8257430"," That's not everybody, but you know, so if you are losing trader or losing investor, just stick with"
"8257430","8257570"," it."
"8257889","8261070"," Even if you're losing money, you just have to stick with it over time."
"8261770","8266450"," And the only other thing I would say to you would be you'll grow your account eventually, you'll"
"8266450","8271889"," stop losing money and you will begin to grow your account, you'll take riskier trades. "
"8272049","8277290"," One of the biggest things for me was always scaling and trading, being able to risk a lot of money"
"8277290","8286170"," and move and then that was probably the biggest thing like over time, like making bigger and bigger"
"8286170","8286430"," trades."
"8286430","8292770"," And then I fuck around with small trades all the time, so then it's a long process."
"8293110","8297150"," You got like spreads making money, so if you close shit up, you at least got spread saving your"
"8297150","8300110"," ass, hedging helps save your ass when you make a wrong trade. "
"8300469","8305629"," And then of course, you shouldn't be risking 90% of your goddamn account every trade."
"8306629","8311590"," And if you're gonna risk 100% of your account in one trade, I don't disbelieve in that concept,"
"8311590","8317450"," like if you're trying to grow your account and you're like, pay cap only got a thousand bucks, and"
"8317450","8318430"," you want to grow your accounts?"
"8318750","8322730"," Yeah, to put some risk on, like throw 100% of your clear thousand dollars down in a trade that"
"8322730","8325889"," you know is gonna work, you know is gonna trade, make money."
"8326350","8330250"," But then your second trade will be fucking putting like your two thousand dollars down in that"
"8330250","8336889"," goddamn trade, but like fucking a hundred bucks on a trade, you know, and then when you've traded"
"8336889","8340549"," with 10% of your money, then only trade with the 5% of your money, then only trade with"
"8340549","8343290"," 1% of your money as you grow that account. "
"8343969","8347990"," You don't need to do 100% 10 times and think you're gonna make a million dollars, you might."
"8348790","8349969"," But it's gonna be rare."
"8350270","8356469"," So if I lose, you know, like 1% of my account on a bad trade, it's not that big"
"8356469","8359389"," of a deal, you know, it's nothing. "
"8361629","8364570"," And there's some other things, you talked about this on stream in the past, you have to make some"
"8364570","8369410"," big, you have to make some big money, you can't only make 10% 30% every trade on an"
"8369410","8373290"," average like 10 trades, you have to make some bangers, you have to."
"8373670","8374610"," And we'll talk about that again."
"8374969","8379490"," I've talked about it in the previous streams, or I've done the math for you guys, but we'll do the"
"8379490","8380410"," math again in the future. "
"8380750","8385930"," Like if you make 10 trades, you better make fucking to at least like three of them, like 100%"
"8385930","8388930"," hitters, you know, 200%, 300%."
"8388930","8393270"," So you have to put risk on the same as a bank, banks like, oh, I got to do 60,"
"8393270","8398530"," 40 split stock market bonds, you got people at home, they're like, they got savings account, they"
"8398530","8404290"," got gold, they got, I don't know, foreign pay, they got stocks, they trade options, you have to put"
"8404290","8411510"," some risk on the market to beat taxes, beat inflation, and then also beat your losses heavily."
"8411850","8416110"," So if you take two, three trades, they're bad, and then you make one banger for like 100 to 300%,"
"8416110","8419950"," and what the fuck do you care about with those three losing trades, especially if you can cut your"
"8419950","8424550"," losses, if you know when to cut your losses or know when to add and move on. "
"8425830","8429230"," Okay, so we'll look back at this trade from earlier, real quick."
"8429850","8431190"," Nice little trade down here."
"8431430","8432750"," One, two, boom, move up. "
"8433290","8434430"," Now we're doing it again, right?"
"8434770","8437410"," One down here, trying to hold ourselves up at 440."
"8439150","8441670"," They want to maintain and hold this 440 into the close."
"8442310","8446050"," Big question for the rest of the day is, does the market do that, right?"
"8447830","8448970"," Does it hold maintains?"
"8449450","8453030"," We can make that move higher to 450. "
"8454390","8456170"," How fast can 450 come?"
"8457810","8458630"," Pretty fucking fast."
"8459330","8460450"," Now we're already up here, right?"
"8460550","8460810"," We're at 440."
"8461110","8463070"," We only have 100 another 100 points to go. "
"8463570","8469290"," I guess the question would be do we roll over and to do they take the shorts off here, right?"
"8469530","8472990"," And then we start to roll it over once they've reshort the market over here."
"8472990","8473590"," Is that possible?"
"8474330","8474670"," I don't know."
"8475110","8476250"," I don't know what the answer to that is. "
"8478030","8479810"," I'm flat right now myself."
"8481430","8484930"," I don't know if this rolls over into into the close."
"8485250","8493550"," We do know that the upper bound resistance is at 442.55. We do know that calls came into the"
"8493550","8500370"," market today, so that should allow us to train up to 442.55 as dealers hedge those calls to move"
"8500370","8500570"," up. "
"8501350","8503730"," And so we'll see here."
"8505790","8508310"," Let me see if I can take a look at some other tickers here."
"8511510","8513890"," Let's take a look around a big tech and see what it's doing. "
"8516550","8519790"," I feel like a Tesla still that resistance point up here."
"8519850","8520650"," I don't like that."
"8520970","8522050"," I'll be honest with you. "
"8522090","8523030"," I don't like seeing that."
"8523910","8528390"," I do like this though, right?"
"8528650","8529510"," I do like this move down."
"8529690","8530570"," One, two, three. "
"8531390","8531390"," Boom."
"8532050","8533110"," This is bullish to me."
"8533950","8534470"," 2,000. "
"8534610","8535470"," I like the energy."
"8536730","8539230"," The coiled spring down here trading higher to a thousand."
"8539330","8540010"," I do like that. "
"8540290","8540530"," That look."
"8541230","8542690"," We talked about misfit."
"8542970","8545470"," Same thing yesterday the day before we were talking about misfit. "
"8545770","8548710"," That coil that action that it wants to break through here."
"8549410","8550930"," We could see that move."
"8551730","8555670"," And then, of course, the question becomes, does it become bearish and reverse here?"
"8555810","8556550"," But this is bullish. "
"8556930","8557790"," Can't deny."
"8558490","8561190"," There's not a lot of energy in here, right?"
"8561410","8562770"," Can't deny that that's not there."
"8563770","8570470"," You know that the Fed, whether you like it or not, was bullish, right?"
"8571870","8575010"," They're going to try to fight inflation and let the market grow. "
"8575610","8577910"," Look at that gorgeous mark over there."
"8580770","8581910"," Price target 168."
"8582670","8592410"," It's trading at 161.92. This is all"
"8592410","8592750"," bullish. "
"8593170","8594330"," You can just see it, right?"
"8594590","8594950"," Push down."
"8595110","8595670"," Push down."
"8596190","8597870"," This all looks very bullish to me. "
"8598250","8598390"," Facebook."
"8599210","8600750"," Facebook's probably the best trade out there."
"8601430","8602050"," Be quite frank. "
"8602390","8604310"," They got this giant gap to fill over here."
"8605010","8606290"," Giant gap to fill."
"8606770","8611310"," If I was bullish on any of the big tech, even if Facebook's going to burn, you fucking hate it. "
"8611390","8611950"," I hate it too."
"8612150","8616730"," But if there was one stock, man, Facebook just keeps trucking along."
"8617590","8618990"," Just keeps trucking along. "
"8620490","8621970"," I mean, look at that thing."
"8622150","8623110"," Just damn."
"8624810","8627950"," 90 points that could throw back on down here. "
"8629670","8632150"," At least for where it's at versus the rest of the big tech."
"8634850","8637150"," So some resistance above here at 441."
"8645150","8651210"," So yeah, if you put a 450, 441 put spread, Zach was saying he put a put spread. "
"8651210","8658830"," Not a not a not a he bought some calls or he bought some stock and he wanted to put"
"8658830","8659770"," a put spread to protect himself."
"8660530","8661490"," Not a call spread."
"8662590","8663670"," So I guess what's the question?"
"8663990","8665250"," Do we trade back down here?"
"8665670","8669490"," Yeah, I think that even if we trade, let's say we trade, let's say we hit 450. "
"8670270","8671430"," Still going to come back down."
"8672050","8672950"," Do you have this 450?"
"8673590","8674570"," You got May, right?"
"8676690","8679730"," Yeah, I'd hold those fucking, I'd hold those goddamn 450 put spreads."
"8680690","8681510"," Goddamn right, I would. "
"8682670","8685570"," Because you're still going to do some, let's say you're bullish, you're still going to do something"
"8685570","8687770"," like this and trade back down."
"8688570","8690430"," Still going to catch your money down here somewhere."
"8691470","8695490"," Even if you were to trade higher for 450, 460, you're still going to come back down to this 450"
"8695490","8698150"," at some point, even if it's farther down the rest is a bad drawing. "
"8699330","8701270"," But you're still going to come back down here."
"8701370","8704290"," You're still going to come back down here, even if you trade it for 60 or 470."
"8705230","8709290"," So yeah, both sides of spreads typically enough trading or typically enough printing at some point. "
"8714990","8716830"," So let's see, next trade."
"8723270","8725350"," Is there another trade?"
"8730410","8732810"," One, two, failure, right?"
"8780310","8782270"," Time is right now, 1,124."
"8782930","8785390"," Got the European clothes coming up here in the next few minutes. "
"8791220","8793280"," Might be a quick, let's take"
"8793280","8801260"," a look."
"8801260","8802340"," Try to day trade."
"8804260","8806740"," You guys get a clearer picture of what I'm looking for here. "
"8815000","8823540"," Still slightly below the second here."
"8825340","8826420"," Time was a set."
"8830780","8831740"," I'm 40. "
"8832380","8841580"," A little bit of a roll coming on here."
"8854750","8856610"," I'm going to give it just a minute here."
"8856770","8863290"," I'm watching some calls come in right now on the like a mixed bag, watching like spy calls, spy"
"8863290","8873110"," puts, now spy puts, spy 318, 22, 440, C or 440 P and 437 P mixed bag of them on"
"8873110","8873750"," the money on it. "
"8876130","8878130"," They're looking for a rollover on this."
"8880290","8881850"," There's things we're getting a rollover."
"8886790","8888430"," They want to see this down here. "
"8890330","8891890"," And bulls want to see it too."
"8893310","8896370"," The bulls want to buy this right here."
"8898410","8902410"," The bulls want to buy like, yeah, still down here somewhere. "
"8904210","8906090"," You want to buy this, bam."
"8906910","8913030"," And the bears want to see like, take profit here and then re-enter a short down there, is what"
"8913030","8913570"," the bears want."
"8916490","8917910"," So we'll see if we can get down here. "
"8918010","8918710"," This is 438."
"8919170","8924390"," So we'll take a look and see if their buyers down there still find out his buyers."
"8924850","8925790"," Oh, and it right close that up. "
"8925970","8928150"," We'll sign up as some buyers down there or not."
"8929290","8932530"," And then they are the down below right down here."
"8932650","8939090"," You can see them still sitting down here at 437 instead of 438. "
"8948460","8951640"," So right down here, this sitting here at 437, it's 439."
"8952260","8959020"," We're trading at 439 52 VWAPSAT 438 98, 438 98."
"8962760","8964400"," Let's move up a little bit here. "
"8965860","8967360"," So Ray, I'm going to show you this."
"8968940","8972520"," So this is the VWAP line right here, 438 98."
"8976420","8978520"," Somewhere in here is VWAP. "
"8979140","8982180"," I could put VWAP on here, but I don't bother."
"8982580","8987520"," I just put whatever the VWAP is and I adjust that through the day."
"8987800","8991400"," But somewhere in here, there's a VWAP line and then usually we get a dip below VWAP. "
"8992080","8999000"," And then we know that the next dip is now at 437, way down here."
"9000620","9004460"," So if you break down here, do we actually go this far deep?"
"9004640","9008260"," I can see why people are buying puts right now on this spy."
"9009100","9010820"," I haven't bought anything at the moment. "
"9011560","9012680"," I haven't bought this dip yet."
"9016280","9017520"," We'll see what happens here."
"9019680","9021740"," We'll check the hair indicator. "
"9022660","9024680"," A little bit of a roll in the hair indicator currently."
"9026940","9028080"," I'm going to hang tight here."
"9028780","9030340"," I'm not buying this rip yet. "
"9037680","9038640"," Okay, what are you guys saying?"
"9038860","9040320"," I'm looking for some speculation after you're closed."
"9040980","9041660"," Can you do Google?"
"9041960","9043620"," So let me go back here and see if you guys are asking for it."
"9043680","9044600"," I'll do some charts for you. "
"9047780","9050580"," The thing I learned is doing over trade in the right position size."
"9051020","9053060"," Absolutely, I agree with that chase, 100%."
"9055300","9058820"," Spy-dye-spy-spy-spy-dye-dye-dye. "
"9058820","9062720"," I didn't see what all you guys said."
"9064220","9065440"," YouTube is a job."
"9068240","9070080"," The taxes suck on trading. "
"9071400","9072620"," The taxes suck."
"9073460","9077220"," I will warn you, let's go through."
"9077440","9079060"," Let me go back up here and hear what you guys are saying here. "
"9082830","9084410"," Can you live stream on only fans?"
"9087090","9089610"," I could get naked with a pair of fucking speedos."
"9090310","9092130"," You're going to post it on Twitter, look sick cat."
"9092270","9092790"," Fuck yeah, Cody. "
"9094910","9098690"," Talking about a trade for you that you use good money."
"9099410","9100090"," Same, Cody."
"9100430","9101530"," All sorry to tax deductible. "
"9102790","9105030"," No, am I tax deductible?"
"9105970","9106950"," You know, it's odd."
"9107550","9109950"," Hotchiff, I'm tax deductible at this point."
"9113010","9118790"," I'm thinking about that, making it a non-profit. "
"9119210","9120130"," I'm thinking about that."
"9120590","9121390"," That's on the table."
"9121610","9122830"," I've been talked to about that. "
"9125550","9126850"," Three years, two, five years."
"9127110","9129010"," You have two, four, and you should be trading on the B2M."
"9129150","9130070"," Hell yeah, bro. "
"9130350","9137430"," Soon enough, if it came on, it's not that high, but not far off."
"9137870","9139470"," I have a 434-port."
"9139570","9140470"," Why does it go up?"
"9140590","9142270"," If spy rips, how can that be?"
"9142670","9143750"," Premium, Idon. "
"9148460","9148820"," Premium."
"9149380","9152760"," There's always, if you're seeing premium leak into your puts, whatever."
"9152940","9153860"," I don't know what dates you have. "
"9154340","9157140"," Means that banks are buying them right now, even though the market's going up."
"9157880","9160060"," I'm curious, Chris, my position size of some of these trades."
"9160840","9161820"," Oh, so like, okay. "
"9162140","9164880"," So I used to, okay, that's a good question."
"9165020","9166000"," Hotchiff, before I make my way down."
"9166480","9168800"," Okay, back in the day, I used to try to make huge trades. "
"9168800","9172060"," Like 30, 40, $50,000 sweeps, $100,000 sweeps."
"9172560","9173240"," I don't do that anymore."
"9174680","9177300"," I think that they know, I think market makers know you're doing that. "
"9177440","9177980"," They fuck you."
"9178700","9184680"," So now I try to hide my trades, 100 lots, 300 lots on options."
"9185560","9188240"," I'll buy 100 packs, two, three of them at a time. "
"9188840","9189860"," And then I'll scale in as well."
"9190180","9193180"," So if I start to lose the trade, if I know that I can, I'm in the right trade, I"
"9193180","9194500"," just bought the wrong bottom or something."
"9195140","9197420"," I'll keep adding, keep adding, keep adding until it wins. "
"9199860","9202120"," Uh, Gary's like, just call the news, bro."
"9204520","9205400"," Uh, yeah, great."
"9205580","9207100"," And $20,000 a month is good money. "
"9207420","9207960"," Yes, it is."
"9209680","9212780"," It has to make it more of a salary, $40 a year."
"9213200","9214000"," Cap, how many calls?"
"9214320","9214620"," Buy calls. "
"9214960","9215860"," Did you buy on that trade?"
"9216760","9217980"," That'd be a good indicator."
"9218440","9219060"," About three to 500."
"9220800","9222700"," Uh, short here with all those sellers. "
"9223080","9223820"," See if you can get a $44."
"9224160","9224980"," Chase, or sorry, bro."
"9225080","9226240"," I'm doing the same thing right now. "
"9226300","9226800"," I'm shorting spy."
"9227940","9229020"," I'm in there last time."
"9229140","9231220"," Oh, yeah, the drink human dude. "
"9231420","9234360"," When you lose big, big through six, big drink, drink human."
"9234500","9236320"," When you lose big trades, it sucks."
"9237340","9241540"," Dude, and I held that shit to the bitter fucking end to the bitter end. "
"9242540","9243600"," Can you check out the VIX?"
"9243920","9244640"," Yeah, I can look at the VIX."
"9247360","9249820"," That 2461, it's falling."
"9251940","9255140"," Uh, taxes, pay someone to do taxes. "
"9255140","9257660"," If you're making up money, pay some taxes, or pay somebody."
"9258240","9259480"," Don't fuck around your taxes."
"9260640","9263840"," Johnny Boyz, like I lost a total of $3.50 to $5,000 before I learned. "
"9263960","9264220"," Absolutely."
"9265680","9267280"," Yep, I've lost a lot of money."
"9269400","9270660"," Uh, good to know. "
"9270860","9272040"," Yeah, you have to stick to it."
"9272620","9274140"," Shoot, Shider, just stick to it."
"9275680","9277480"," Dump things down and stick to it. "
"9277520","9278000"," Shit, you're not."
"9278560","9279320"," Stick to it."
"9280840","9282220"," I'm very good at losing money. "
"9282280","9282720"," I learned a lot."
"9282980","9284380"," But it's the top."
"9284580","9285340"," What's down side, Tiger Blow?"
"9285620","9287320"," I used to trade over 20 tickers and I'm down. "
"9287700","9289940"," Yeah, like, uh, so Desparado makes a good point."
"9290160","9291860"," I used to trade over, I used to hold all kinds of shit."
"9291960","9292780"," Now I just trade Spy. "
"9293440","9295720"," Uh, I'll, I'll, I'll trade right now."
"9295760","9296340"," I focus on Tesla."
"9296660","9297760"," I used to tell folks on Apple. "
"9298460","9299640"," Uh, so it's mostly like Apple."
"9299840","9301380"," Right now for me, it's mostly Tesla Apple."
"9301500","9302540"," Tesla Apple, Tesla Apple. "
"9302620","9302940"," Sorry."
"9303260","9304420"," Tesla Spy, Tesla Spy."
"9306080","9307100"," Spy, die, die, die. "
"9311480","9314520"," Well, you ran the scam, uh, you ran the uh, scan yet again today, Otis."
"9314520","9316160"," That's a great scan by the way, brother."
"9316880","9320000"," Uh, especially if we're in a bullish context, that's a kick-ass scan. "
"9323420","9324340"," Don't over trade, greed."
"9326300","9329200"," Uh, well, the last thing I couldn't trade goes wrong way."
"9329820","9332520"," Uh, I really used to follow this trap of hoping and waiting for change. "
"9333120","9337100"," We should talk about that some, we should talk about that at some point about, uh, wanting to know"
"9337100","9342280"," when to roll, know when to hold, know when to add, uh, when, where and how."
"9342800","9344740"," Uh, we should, we need to, we need to do that video one of these."
"9344740","9348660"," On a slow day this summer, what do you guys know that on a slow day, we'll have a slow,"
"9348660","9349640"," we'll have some slow weeks. "
"9353340","9357920"," So we'll, we'll have slow, slow weeks in the summertime, dog days of summer."
"9358120","9360200"," We're going to sit here and we're going to do all kinds of training."
"9360200","9362940"," I promise to you guys, we're going to do all kinds of shit. "
"9363080","9365180"," We're going to go through, I'm going to answer your questions in depth."
"9365460","9371300"," Like we'll go through when to roll hold, uh, when to flip from bear to bull, while we go from"
"9371300","9371780"," bull bear."
"9372560","9376540"," If you're in a losing position, if you were in the right position, but you're, uh, timed it wrong,"
"9377020","9379060"," how to continue to make money from that losing position. "
"9379540","9387100"," Um, uh, heat map shows for you to be taken out, but, uh, right, big red candle engulfing, winky"
"9387100","9387340"," right."
"9387500","9390540"," Currently, I'm not super fast as executing so on scops over a few minutes."
"9390560","9392100"," I just don't want to mess with swings. "
"9392100","9393000"," That was something I do."
"9393480","9394200"," Market is leaking."
"9394600","9395820"," Could you talk about Tesla, please?"
"9396540","9401340"," Um, 430, you can tell by Tesla, uh, Google, I'll do Google again. "
"9401340","9404120"," I said I would do Google to goog, bevel, do goog."
"9405660","9407380"," If you guys want me to chart goog out, I will."
"9409580","9413480"," Yeah, I love goog, uh, Tesla, by the way. "
"9414020","9414820"," Like love Tesla."
"9419400","9422540"," But I've divorced myself from even Tesla news, believe it or not."
"9423420","9425060"," Uh, I used to fall down that rabbit hole. "
"9426520","9427280"," What's going on here?"
"9427360","9429560"," What's going up looks like more sellers and buyers."
"9429560","9432300"," Something calls puts better for mental health than day trading."
"9432300","9433180"," Amazon and fire. "
"9433600","9436300"," How much do you consider cash count funds clear the next day?"
"9436480","9437140"," No PDT worries."
"9437580","9439460"," You notice 100%."
"9440040","9442420"," Uh, yeah, and I do have different accounts. "
"9442720","9444240"," So I trade, I've got multiple accounts."
"9444860","9447000"," I trade on a margin account for spreads."
"9447720","9451740"," Um, and then I have a cash account that I trade, uh, day trade with. "
"9452240","9456100"," By day trading, never, ever, ever, ever, ever day trade with margin."
"9456560","9457900"," Ever, ever."
"9457900","9460220"," I don't know if I can explain that better to you. "
"9460280","9464420"," Don't ever, ever use anyone else's money, uh, for your day trading for A's."
"9464640","9470460"," So Google, I should write all this shit down and write a book."
"9472840","9473980"," That's not gonna see that. "
"9474080","9477000"," It's just like, I should write all this shit down."
"9479320","9482600"," 2750, 2800, 2860."
"9483980","9484980"," Player skies above. "
"9485740","9488780"," Google is not really showing too much on book map."
"9489660","9492260"," You want to see where the sellers are here."
"9493880","9495920"," Uh, it's 2700, it looks like. "
"9496200","9498160"," You got more buyers and sellers currently on Google."
"9498920","9501660"," Um, this is a big bank stock, I meant."
"9506850","9508970"," Spy is fucking ripping, by the way. "
"9509050","9510930"," I should have bought that goddamn dip and I didn't."
"9511650","9512090"," Whatever."
"9512530","9513350"," I'm focusing on you guys. "
"9513590","9515990"," I see you guys get me caught where I'm not paying attention."
"9517310","9519410"," And, uh, I'm not making any money right now."
"9519960","9522070"," Okay, so you're looking at some resistance on Google currently. "
"9523850","9531890"," Um, you can see this in resistance, but it looks but overall the charts kind of bullish, kind of, I"
"9531890","9537030"," don't like Google as much as I like some other tickers, but it is a hedge fund favorite."
"9537410","9541530"," It did trade down to a quadruple bottom down at 2492."
"9541930","9543050"," I mean, it's looking bullish overall. "
"9545650","9547390"," Oh, and I don't like about Google."
"9547390","9558690"," Uh, is it never really got a full, never really got a full, a full, um, a"
"9558690","9560650"," full, uh, wake off distribution, right?"
"9560910","9564450"," You kind of want to see something, kind of want to see something like this."
"9565150","9567110"," Of course, the banks never want to sell it, right?"
"9567270","9568890"," It's like their market hedge is Google. "
"9569770","9573670"," And for good reason, you know, something like this, maybe not this deep."
"9577380","9578420"," That's a little ridiculous."
"9578420","9580340"," Maybe to hear, it'd be nice to see. "
"9581740","9583840"," It doesn't mean you can't trade out of these bonds."
"9584660","9590660"," It doesn't mean you can't like, you can't trade up here and still have a distribution in this"
"9590660","9590960"," trade."
"9591980","9595900"," But, you know, this is one of those tickers, man, like Apple's kind of this kind of a ticker too. "
"9596600","9603720"," Like I know the reason why it's not going to come down here is because it's because of, um, I"
"9603720","9605340"," mean, you got to see man where it traded from."
"9606240","9608200"," And look at where it's fucking traded."
"9608540","9611560"," This is where it was in, in March 2020, okay?"
"9611920","9612740"," It's shit like this. "
"9612920","9618280"," When I see shit like this, I'm like, look at Google, you know, when I look at Google."
"9621540","9626840"," Okay, so maybe it doesn't have to come down to 1500, but we spent some time."
"9626980","9628660"," We spent a lot of time down here. "
"9629020","9630780"," It's been a lot of time over here."
"9631040","9633820"," And this looks like to quite get that this is support."
"9635000","9644780"," But like seriously, man, probably not probably not going to see"
"9644780","9645060"," that. "
"9647400","9650440"," But I'm telling you what, if we have a risk off event in the market, right?"
"9652360","9654340"," If we, this is like, do you know what this reminds me of?"
"9654540","9657480"," Amazon in the dot com crash."
"9657840","9659120"," Like tickers that couldn't crash."
"9659800","9664980"," If there is ever a crash or a moment in the market where the market fails, uh, I would be"
"9664980","9665860"," targeting Google. "
"9667020","9673140"," If you did, if you like, if you wanted to make money outside of an index, fucking right, right for"
"9673140","9673380"," picking."
"9674280","9677300"," I totally, I don't, but I get why it's, it's as high as it is."
"9678020","9679760"," I get why I can go even higher from here. "
"9679900","9683440"," I understand all the positives for Google, but dude, I'm telling you what."
"9684460","9691180"," And you guys, you know what's crazy is the company like this would survive a crash and also be, if"
"9691180","9697620"," you guys wanted a stock to buy during a crash, Google, the fact that it hasn't rolled over, if"
"9697620","9701440"," you're going to target a stock, I know people are going to say, not Google, but it is."
"9703620","9713100"," Um, so on a small timeframe, yeah, I like Google here, but in reality, man, you know, you guys are"
"9713100","9717320"," like, you guys are always like, you guys are not, you guys specifically, when people on Twitter are"
"9717320","9721860"," like, especially like any kind of gang, Microsoft gang, Tesla gang, doesn't matter what gang it is,"
"9721940","9723840"," any bull, they're like, it can't go down, it's Google. "
"9724820","9731620"," And I'm like, you guys forget, you guys, some of you guys are never were there when, uh, you saw"
"9731620","9735640"," the best companies just fucking lose every fucking last dollar."
"9736360","9740620"," And this is, man, this would be a good one right here, price target."
"9746840","9748160"," This is a good one. "
"9757940","9761500"," 27, 59, 70, right there."
"9769230","9773290"," 29, 29, 59, 70 is my PT on Google."
"9776030","9781330"," I mean, why would you be, if we had a market crash, why fucking target snap at this point, fucking,"
"9781510","9783090"," that'd be targeted fucking Google. "
"9784690","9786450"," So let's look and see if it can get up there."
"9787730","9798830"," Because from resistance, that's 2750, 2800, see"
"9798830","9800130"," if there's a hard sell up here or not."
"9800790","9802290"," Yeah, hard sell at 3000. "
"9809250","9813190"," 26, 940 is where it's currently lies right now."
"9816430","9818130"," 2740 is right here."
"9821130","9823250"," 2740 is where I think it goes right now. "
"9823890","9826410"," I think you break through this and make it to 2740, 27."
"9826730","9828430"," I think I want to call it a 2740."
"9829130","9831190"," I've got this some hidden ice in here that we can't see. "
"9839310","9840990"," Yeah, right in here, there's some hidden ice."
"9845840","9846680"," I love Google."
"9846940","9852660"," Don't get me wrong, but, uh, I'm not saying we're having a market crash. "
"9852720","9855840"," We're saying if we ever did have one, we'd be like the first fucking ticker I picked out."
"9856480","9857560"," Everyone's like a pick Tesla."
"9857760","9859080"," I'm like, uh, there's some better ones. "
"9861540","9863340"," Samuel Adams was like that."
"9864140","9867060"," Samuel Adams was just fucking paid up."
"9867320","9868880"," I think look at, let's look at Samuel Adams. "
"9869860","9873060"," Like talk about the easiest fucking short known to man, right?"
"9880070","9881930"," Right, America's bear company."
"9882090","9882590"," Look at that shit."
"9883810","9885210"," Like look at that stupid shit. "
"9885750","9887950"," Trade net fucking two hundred three hundred dollars."
"9888310","9890430"," I think shit goes up to fifteen hundred and fifty dollars."
"9891070","9892610"," Like I'm not going to short that shit down. "
"9893330","9893730"," Shit."
"9895550","9896590"," That's what you're looking for."
"9896710","9897690"," You're like, yeah, it'll never happen. "
"9898070","9899010"," Fucking right, it'll happen."
"9900490","9901470"," Eventually it happens."
"9904130","9914910"," Uh, glad"
"9914910","9915770"," to see Amazon, Mary. "
"9916030","9917330"," I think it's all three, really cut says."
"9922140","9923180"," So what do I think about oil?"
"9923460","9924920"," The oil contract ends this month."
"9926980","9927860"," That's what I think about oil. "
"9928400","9929840"," I know the oil contract ends today, right?"
"9930040","9931000"," It ends on a monthly basis."
"9931860","9938360"," Uh, so today is usually I don't see a lot happen on oil on expiration."
"9940420","9944720"," Um, don't quote me on that, but typically I used to move after. "
"9947600","9951080"," And sure enough, I just looked up USO and it's kind of trained sideways."
"9952140","9953040"," Not to be unexpected."
"9954120","9956200"," Do I think that there'll be another bid in oil?"
"9957060","9960020"," Yeah, I think there's another bid in oil. "
"9960800","9966620"," I think that, uh, I think though that the moment, I think within the next three weeks though that"
"9966620","9967320"," that trade is over."
"9969400","9970800"," I'm going to give it three more weeks."
"9973720","9974540"," We'll look at Tesla. "
"9974720","9977660"," Tesla's trying to test, uh, that's upper bounds right now."
"9979100","9979940"," I'm going to go back."
"9980040","9980920"," I'm going to try to make a trade myself. "
"9981900","9983700"," And then we'll talk about a coin."
"9986100","9988760"," So something about coin."
"9991720","9993340"," No, see what Tesla's doing. "
"9993420","9997080"," It's trying to trying to beat its way above 900 to break to 1000."
"10004600","10009160"," Uh, it's messing starting to turn a little bit negative here, but still have more buyers currently"
"10009160","10009640"," on Tesla."
"10014000","10015300"," Tesla's a tough one right here. "
"10015560","10021560"," I, you know, it's tempting for bears to be like, I'm going to short this shit to hell right now."
"10022440","10023760"," That's what a bear saying to himself."
"10027570","10028990"," It's trying to go flat a little bit. "
"10029570","10031890"," Looks like some profit taking is coming out."
"10040150","10042450"," Markets is quieting down a little bit right now."
"10042470","10043990"," See, this is common on OPEC's days. "
"10044710","10046790"," See, the markets just start to calm down a little bit."
"10046790","10051530"," Price target above is 910, 90972."
"10051810","10053230"," There's a lot of the ice in here. "
"10053950","10055430"," Sellers are still hiding in here."
"10056210","10058230"," And, uh, there's more traffic above."
"10058470","10059230"," You can probably see it. "
"10060950","10061830"," See them right here?"
"10062530","10063550"," They're just hiding in here."
"10067970","10070950"," Uh, the market's going to calm down here for a minute."
"10071090","10073450"," You can see even the volume is slowing down. "
"10073890","10075010"," It's common on OPEC's days."
"10075590","10077910"," It's currently 11.46 in the afternoon, probably lunchtime."
"10078170","10083050"," The big boys have to go do some cocaine, banks and hookers, and drink a bourbon lunch. "
"10084090","10084190"," Right."
"10099720","10100860"," Thanks for the heads up, Al."
"10101100","10103180"," That's kind of selling a aircraft carrier through time one straight. "
"10103860","10104360"," Can you see the queues?"
"10104700","10104780"," Yes."
"10106580","10107280"," You can."
"10108860","10110780"," Just a breather in the market currently. "
"10111160","10115700"," If you guys want to know if Tesla's going to go higher, just watch the options flow."
"10115700","10122520"," If you see options flow rolling in on Tesla, you'll see a push higher currently right now."
"10122600","10125360"," It looks like there's a break in the market for OPEC's. "
"10127580","10132280"," What was the question on the ever put in orders to sell by longer than a day order?"
"10135180","10135660"," Yes."
"10136740","10137220"," Yes."
"10137380","10138480"," Wink, you haven't encountered that. "
"10139080","10142160"," I've I've I don't ever short Tesla to be honest."
"10143960","10148380"," I've noticed it being a retail trader that I get fucked off in when my the larger the trade that"
"10148380","10150340"," I make unless I can hide it."
"10152360","10153680"," I do small bags. "
"10153880","10157440"," You should have our age with PE limit and then do we will cash still every day and just let"
"10157440","10157760"," me know."
"10158260","10164620"," No, dude, you guys, if you have a small account, if you have a small account, I don't I don't"
"10164620","10166100"," think every everybody does it."
"10166300","10173180"," I don't think everybody does it, but there's a if you guys have small accounts let's talk about"
"10173180","10174060"," small accounts real quick. "
"10174100","10176340"," Yeah, man."
"10176600","10177660"," DXV, what are you talking about?"
"10179140","10185400"," Let's talk about small accounts real quick because I've had a small account before but I have a"
"10185400","10187260"," whole diet, diet tribe on it."
"10189240","10198660"," So let's start with QQQ support at 4.37 here in Decatur is green or is good, right?"
"10199240","10200720"," Positive, but it's a little bit of a rollover. "
"10200720","10202740"," Just looks like the market's just taking a break right now."
"10202740","10205500"," This is specific to OPEC's days, okay?"
"10205540","10206160"," This is normal."
"10206960","10208380"," So we're going to go to Spy real quick. "
"10209080","10210620"," The fuck is going on here?"
"10218530","10219190"," No, I'm not."
"10219430","10221790"," We'll talk about yield for a yield curve inversion."
"10224470","10226350"," There's a little bit of a discussion about that yesterday. "
"10227850","10230650"," So let's talk about first, let's talk about new accounts."
"10230990","10235550"," If you are not new accounts, if you're a new trader with a small account, I think it's $25,000."
"10239270","10241410"," There's a little bit of a rollover going on the market right now. "
"10241930","10246050"," So you will see the market rollover if we don't see more action, like more buying, more call"
"10246050","10247470"," buying, more equity buying."
"10248190","10250710"," It seems like there's a little bit of a break going on currently."
"10251550","10253810"," We've had some great pumps, one, two, three, four. "
"10254210","10255970"," Had to set some great pumps on the market."
"10256130","10259050"," We had one, two, three, four, five, right?"
"10259230","10264790"," Well, this could possibly be five or we could roll it down into lower numbers for support by down"
"10264790","10264990"," here."
"10265930","10268610"," So we'll keep you updated as we move forward. "
"10269830","10275030"," I'm going to keep my eyes down here where the smart money is down here at $4.37. You don't"
"10275030","10276070"," have to take every trade, right?"
"10276330","10278910"," You'll just try to take a trade that's good for you that you feel confident in."
"10279470","10280770"," Now, let's talk about new accounts."
"10280970","10284990"," If you're a small account trader, let's say you started on Robinhood. "
"10286050","10288850"," You should be moving up to learning how to chart on Weeble."
"10289310","10290870"," I still use Weeble."
"10290870","10293290"," I've used every brokerage out there. "
"10293370","10293890"," I tried them all."
"10295110","10296650"," I've tried trading classes."
"10297030","10297510"," I've tried everything. "
"10297810","10298310"," Do you name it?"
"10298370","10298750"," I've tried it."
"10299550","10301370"," To at least see what, you know, I'm missing something."
"10301750","10304490"," Is there a tool that I can learn from that person or that service or whatever?"
"10305370","10306730"," And actually, I kept it. "
"10306890","10308350"," I still use Weeble to this day."
"10308830","10310050"," And I use Weeble to this day."
"10310150","10315110"," I don't trade on Weeble, but I do use the charts because I've timed it against Ninja. "
"10315510","10319750"," I've timed it against everybody."
"10319750","10328890"," Not everybody, but like interactive brokers, timed it against trading view, paid data feeds, and"
"10328890","10333610"," it's within milliseconds of any of the best charting out there."
"10334010","10338690"," If there's one thing I can give Weeble credit for, it is that their charts are fast. "
"10340210","10343270"," So they're slightly faster than a lot of charting software out there."
"10343410","10343890"," Believe it or not."
"10344210","10346470"," And you're not going to believe or agree with that, but I promise you it is. "
"10347070","10348150"," And so I still use it."
"10348150","10351230"," I hold over for me and I still chart on trading view."
"10351490","10352830"," I do my research on trading view. "
"10353170","10360070"," I do my day trading with a combination of book map, but I actually pay for for feed for, right?"
"10360150","10362770"," Actually pay money for my data feed."
"10363410","10365230"," And then I still use for quick and dirty."
"10365470","10369410"," I still use Weeble for quick and dirty candlestick charts. "
"10370090","10371330"," And they work fine for me."
"10371590","10374050"," And I use trading view for my research."
"10374050","10376970"," But if you're a new trader, get the fuck off Robinhood. "
"10377110","10378290"," Well, you can still use Robinhood."
"10378350","10383410"," I like Robinhood still to do some complex spread trading for a new person learning new spreads."
"10383710","10385810"," I guess it's still not a bad software. "
"10386810","10389050"," But learn how to trade on like Weeble or some."
"10389210","10391010"," It's free cost you nothing."
"10391730","10394130"," But then my next thing to tell you would be this. "
"10395030","10401830"," Even if you're just executing basic options for even stock trades is fine to other brokers."
"10402450","10406870"," The first broker that you want to find is a broker that's backed by a bank."
"10407910","10414130"," So like a broker that's backed by like Chase Schwab, Bank of America, I don't know what bank you"
"10414130","10420750"," use, but use a bank that also lets you trade stocks so that you're not using an order flow service. "
"10421450","10422410"," And I'm going to give you two examples."
"10422790","10429350"," Okay, let's say you Schwab and you're just using it to trade stock by and sell stock."
"10429350","10433170"," Okay, the reason you do that is so that you never get cut off. "
"10433750","10435470"," So it's like a sell only kind of a thing."
"10436170","10441770"," They have the money to back their accounts where they won't shut trading off to you first"
"10441770","10442310"," typically."
"10442930","10446330"," Sometimes they'll warn you you can't short something or sometimes they warn you you can only sell"
"10446330","10453050"," eventually, but usually you can get out of trades before other people can unless it gets halted by"
"10453050","10462330"," the SEC or by the by the whatever by the CME or by what it doesn't matter. "
"10462490","10468390"," So the key is this you don't want to get you don't want to get shut down by like a"
"10468390","10475990"," Robinhood or by a Weebl or by any of these other like fly by night, gamified trading apps or"
"10475990","10477890"," brokerages out there."
"10478030","10480730"," So that's how you should be buying in selling stock."
"10481210","10487110"," Okay, your second thing that you should be doing is opening an account with a real broker for"
"10487110","10489290"," options like a broker that's good at options. "
"10489510","10491170"," You don't necessarily pay for your data feeds."
"10491830","10496550"," You don't necessarily need to be using an interactive brokers or ninja trading during these fucking"
"10496550","10502470"," like you don't have to pay in trade trading view or book map or any other fucking nonsense for your"
"10502470","10506850"," trades, but you could pick up a brokerage with a that's a real brokerage like tasty works."
"10508070","10510590"," I'm not affiliated with them in any kind of way, but I'll tell you this. "
"10511890","10514750"," I'll tell you this, especially for your small account number one."
"10516150","10519770"," If I have ever have a fucking problem ever have a problem."
"10520530","10523610"," I've had problems like I went skiing once right. "
"10523830","10529570"," I was skiing from sitting in a hotel room or some nonsense and I made a trade for like 20"
"10529570","10533430"," grand or something stupid and literally the brokerage went down or there's fuck."
"10533570","10539850"," I don't know what the fuck happened, but I ended up losing like 15 grand in like five seconds and"
"10539850","10541850"," it happened to be a technical issue."
"10542070","10543370"," It wasn't my fault. "
"10543370","10548690"," And I was able to fucking call tasty works, right?"
"10548970","10553670"," And they fucking gave him my money back in like five seconds, like five sec."
"10553850","10558050"," Matter of fact, when I first called, I was screaming and the guy hung up on me."
"10558090","10558890"," He goes, go fuck yourself. "
"10559070","10560310"," Call me back when you're not so pissed off."
"10561670","10562790"," So he did."
"10562890","10563510"," He hung up on me. "
"10563890","10568270"," And so I got my, I cooled down a little bit and then I called back and I apologized and"
"10568270","10569350"," they answered the phone right away."
"10569750","10573150"," There's someone on the other end answer your call and they're like, what the fuck is wrong with"
"10573150","10573230"," you?"
"10573290","10574110"," And I'm like, Oh, there's that."
"10574250","10574730"," And everything happened. "
"10575330","10578890"," And they just investigate your account real quick and they fix your problem for you."
"10579010","10582610"," So number one, you should be making your trades on a brokerage, especially like options."
"10583350","10584370"," Does that be tasty works?"
"10584370","10586390"," But I'm just saying find yourself a fucking brokerage. "
"10586690","10590410"," Even if you get a $500 account, you're $500 in that account, right?"
"10590950","10592410"," You can make a make an account book."
"10592730","10597010"," Are you sign up for the brokerage and make your first account to cash account 500 bucks in there?"
"10597130","10599710"," And if you have a problem, right, they're always fucking there for you."
"10599930","10603850"," There's a voice on the other end of that line and I'm telling you, that shit pays. "
"10604570","10606970"," Okay, that shit pays having someone behind you."
"10607210","10608610"," Ooh, that looks like a good buy in the spy."
"10609910","10611810"," That's a VWAP dip buy right there. "
"10614670","10616050"," See if this is real or not."
"10619030","10620170"," And I'm still not convinced."
"10621630","10624090"," So let's see that sale that this book map helps you. "
"10624270","10626490"," I'm not still not convinced in this dip buy right here."
"10627290","10631670"," So anyways, open up a brokerage on a tasty or something like that."
"10631790","10632750"," And the reason I'm telling you that, right?"
"10632970","10633970"," And the reason I'm telling you that is this. "
"10634430","10636650"," If you ever have a fucking problem, somebody enters the fucking phone."
"10637410","10637670"," Okay."
"10637910","10639170"," And the second reason is this. "
"10639890","10646430"," So let's say you open up a cash account on Robinhood for like a grand and you have that PDT"
"10646430","10648670"," rule where you can only make so many trades."
"10648670","10651890"," I don't know what the PDT rule rules are anymore."
"10652590","10655210"," But let's say you can only make so many fucking opens and closes in the day. "
"10655330","10659790"," The one thing they do know about those rules is those rules, they say that those rules are in place"
"10659790","10661270"," so that you learn to make better trades."
"10661890","10665890"," I think that's the that's what they say is that they say like, Oh, you should be planning your"
"10665890","10666690"," trades properly."
"10667270","10671410"," And if you make the wrong trade, you should pay the fucking price and stay in it and lose all"
"10671410","10671750"," your money. "
"10671930","10673870"," And it also it fucks with your brain."
"10674350","10678490"," Because your fucking brain is telling you, well, I'm going to hold myself in this trade because if"
"10678490","10679590"," I get a PDM fucked."
"10680070","10683170"," And what happens in the in the long run is you get burned in that trade. "
"10683790","10685590"," Okay, because you're learning bad habits."
"10686370","10689350"," Because if you're in a bad trade and you need to get out of that trade, you should fucking pull"
"10689350","10690030"," the plug immediately."
"10690870","10692810"," And any successful trader will tell you that. "
"10692810","10695130"," Okay, pull the fucking plug if you need to."
"10695270","10699950"," If your directional move is going up and that bitch starts flipping and going the wrong way on you."
"10699970","10701410"," And you know it ain't coming back. "
"10702010","10702270"," Right?"
"10702510","10706230"," You pull the fucking plug, fucking damn the PDT rule."
"10706610","10707890"," It's your fucking money."
"10708290","10714750"," Okay, pull the fucking plug on your fucking trade and reassess what your thought process was for"
"10714750","10715910"," why it should be going that way. "
"10716270","10717410"," That's gets me to hold another thing."
"10718030","10721350"," Like, when you make a trade, it should automatically be going in your way."
"10721650","10724970"," You should ever be taking a trade that you're like, well, I think it's going to bounce to 10"
"10724970","10725710"," minutes or an hour. "
"10726110","10729750"," Like you better be getting that fucking turn and you better be have a confirmation that you're"
"10729750","10731470"," taking that trade, especially in a small account."
"10731970","10734010"," Anyways, rant over on that end of things."
"10734310","10740190"," But you get taught to make bad trades and trades and stay in them with these PDT DPD rules. "
"10740410","10740870"," So here's what you do."
"10741350","10745190"," Here's some taste trade account for your 500 bucks in there, right?"
"10746010","10749170"," Get yourself some charting software like fucking Webull or some shit like that."
"10749230","10750690"," Learn how to fucking do basic charting. "
"10750870","10751710"," Get yourself a map."
"10752350","10755110"," You can get a download them off Google and it shows you like basic setups."
"10755390","10758250"," Learn basic rules of trading with a bull flag. "
"10758690","10761890"," People are like people like fuck bull flags and bear flags and penance."
"10761950","10764190"," And I'll tell you what, that shit helps."
"10765050","10766870"," You got to learn you got to learn that shit. "
"10766870","10769270"," You got to learn Elliott wave theory."
"10769290","10773370"," You got all kinds of other you learn gamma and you got to learn this and that all the time."
"10773530","10774350"," Start the basics. "
"10774970","10780550"," Start at the basics, basic charting, basic candlestick charts, that kind of shit."
"10780850","10783290"," Don't rely on upon Mac D and all that nonsense."
"10784010","10785170"," Those are stupid fucking indicators. "
"10786130","10787810"," And sorry, we don't have tangent here."
"10788070","10790370"," But open yourself a taste for trade brokerage."
"10790590","10795490"," The reason I'm telling you that is because with P D P D rules what you can do is open"
"10795490","10800810"," like you can literally go in and open like 20 accounts on tasty. "
"10801170","10802410"," I shouldn't be saying this because it's illegal."
"10802950","10806790"," But you can open up like 20 accounts on tasty trade that one brokerage you have."
"10806790","10808770"," You can just open up multiple fucking accounts. "
"10809270","10812230"," You take that 500 bucks and you trade it to win."
"10812670","10819670"," And if you start losing you have to cut to cut trade off, you don't have to make five trades"
"10819670","10820250"," or 10 trades."
"10820250","10824030"," And you in one day and you got a P D T slap and they go where shutting your counter"
"10824030","10824550"," down your fucked. "
"10825330","10829070"," You take that money that money that you actually fucking made because you shut your trades down."
"10829650","10831770"," Let's say you're like, Oh, fuck, I hate cap."
"10831770","10834250"," I got a P D T busted, right?"
"10834450","10834990"," But I booked up. "
"10835090","10839010"," I did make 1500 bucks today because I did get out of bad trades and kept going at it."
"10839010","10840490"," So I made the money, right?"
"10840870","10841970"," But now I got 1500 bucks."
"10842150","10844010"," Am I closing now only closing or closing?"
"10844450","10848970"," I think they call closing trades, whatever only when you close those trades of profit, you get out"
"10848970","10850670"," of there, take your 1500 bucks, right?"
"10850770","10854090"," And you move it back in your bank, then you move it back into another tasty trade account. "
"10854670","10857550"," And then you're good to go right once again, you're back rocking and rolling again."
"10857870","10862390"," If you burn that next one down, you then move your money to the next tasty trade account that you"
"10862390","10862590"," have."
"10863210","10864250"," Now you can't do that today. "
"10864250","10867850"," I don't think on Robinhood, I don't think Robinhood allows you to open like multiple accounts under"
"10867850","10868870"," the same social screen number."
"10869090","10870610"," But I know that a real brokerage does."
"10871530","10875690"," You don't have to go begging for forgiveness from tasty trade or any of these other brokers. "
"10876150","10879990"," They'll let you open like fucking 10, 12, 20 fucking accounts, right?"
"10880250","10882610"," And you just shift your money between those accounts."
"10884430","10889990"," You know, that's a bad habit too, because 10 years later, you'll have like 20 accounts at three to"
"10889990","10891330"," 15 different brokerages."
"10891670","10895790"," And you'll forget you left money back behind and some of these brokerages, you come back and visit"
"10895790","10899150"," them like five years later, and you're like, Oh shit, there's like 10 grants and in this fucking"
"10899150","10901030"," account, I haven't used it like 10 fucking years. "
"10903070","10910010"," But the point being is, if you've got PDT rules, do not learn the bad habits of PDT trading is"
"10910010","10910330"," my point."
"10910710","10912990"," Do not learn those, do not learn those habits."
"10913550","10914950"," Do not believe what they're telling you. "
"10915050","10916050"," They're there to take all your money."
"10917150","10919070"," The fucking rules are not there for you to succeed."
"10920050","10924790"," The rules are there for you as a new investor, a new trader to lose all your money. "
"10926110","10926790"," That's the truth."
"10927390","10929370"," I'll tell you the fucking truth and that's the truth."
"10931430","10933750"," Okay, because no trader stays in a bad trade. "
"10934250","10936770"," The only asshole that stays in a bad trade is a poor."
"10944910","10954200"," No, no, no, it's, Oh, yeah, no, no, PDT applies."
"10954680","10962000"," I know for sure that the PDT applies if you, if you trade options, and I think if you make"
"10962000","10966540"," like four or five trades a day or a week or some shit like that, even on a cash account,"
"10966820","10967780"," you'll get nailed. "
"10968340","10968940"," I know it does."
"10969260","10969500"," I remember."
"10970600","10975840"," I only traded stock for a very short amount of time, but trading too, not futures options for many,"
"10975920","10976260"," many years. "
"10977660","10979440"," I only traded futures for a brief moment."
"10980240","10981360"," I don't like staying awake all night long."
"10981840","10983340"," Fucking trade in 24 hours a day. "
"10983360","10984180"," Sick bastards."
"10985660","10986580"," Fucking psychos."
"11000660","11002140"," Yeah, dude, like fucking tasty. "
"11002260","11005360"," Let's you open up like a, okay, coin."
"11005560","11005980"," You want to look at coin?"
"11007940","11009320"," That's a good point too, Brad."
"11010340","11013020"," PDT rules do not, that's true. "
"11013220","11014760"," They do not apply to futures accounts."
"11017000","11019300"," But your risk on futures is higher too."
"11019440","11021760"," That's the same, you know, another thing that people get roped into. "
"11022520","11025340"," Like I always like, I'll meet somebody and they don't know I'm a trader."
"11025900","11028760"," They'll meet people out in the real world and stuff and that they don't know I'm a trader."
"11029880","11031500"," It's like most people don't know what I do. "
"11031600","11033000"," I don't talk to people about my profession."
"11034200","11040800"," People kind of know what I do, but uh, I like I meet somebody and I don't, people ask me"
"11040800","11041600"," like, what do you do?"
"11042680","11046620"," And they don't want to hear what I do, you know, because you're, I don't know if you guys know"
"11046620","11050020"," this, but the rest of the remains for USA, you're like, you're a pariah."
"11051000","11055900"," So, um, I meet people and oftentimes if they say they're in the market in some kind of way, they"
"11055900","11059220"," always get roped into like a new trader's like, what are you trading?"
"11059400","11060260"," They're like, I'm trading currencies. "
"11060980","11065680"," I'm trading forex and I'm like, what the fuck are you doing as a new trader trading forex?"
"11066160","11068220"," Like who fucking sold you that bullshit?"
"11069320","11077100"," Like fucking crazy town who forex is great, you know, and uh, but I've always, I'm always amazed"
"11077100","11083120"," that like a new trader they get roped into, um, they get straight fucking roped into, uh, like the"
"11083120","11083700"," craziest shit."
"11083900","11085940"," I'm like, that's some, that's some fucking wild shit."
"11086460","11088640"," You're a new trader and you're trading fucking forex. "
"11089260","11090080"," Like what?"
"11090400","11092560"," Who, who the fuck sold you on that shit?"
"11093760","11097100"," Like whatever happened to good old fashion, just buying a stock and holding it."
"11097600","11100760"," Just saying it like this company that actually works pretty well."
"11100800","11103920"," If you're a new trader, you're like, listen to me right now and you're just never getting new to"
"11103920","11104260"," the market. "
"11104520","11107380"," There's nothing wrong with being like, hey, I'm gonna buy a stock."
"11108080","11109120"," There's nothing wrong with that."
"11109380","11110800"," Don't let anyone ever tell you that either. "
"11111440","11115240"," Don't like think like you're a new trader out there and you listen to my program or you follow me"
"11115240","11119140"," on Twitter and like that and you get like, I have to be this or I have to do that"
"11119140","11125760"," or I have to do these complex fucking ratio trades or fucking ratio spreads or I gotta learn how to"
"11125760","11127100"," fucking sell this and sell that."
"11127240","11131420"," I mean, my favorite one is when people are inside like discords, they're like, yeah, I'm running"
"11131420","11132140"," the wheel right now."
"11132220","11134880"," I'm making less money on this fucking scare fucking trade. "
"11135340","11137360"," The more complicated you make shit, the more harder it becomes."
"11137820","11141840"," The easier you make shit, the easier it becomes to make money, believe it or not."
"11142160","11144020"," So don't feel like you always have to know everything. "
"11144660","11147200"," Sometimes it's better to just be really good at one or two things."
"11147820","11150980"," If you're like really good at buying and selling stock, if you're really, really good at shorting"
"11150980","11154040"," the market, whatever you like, enjoy to do, just do it."
"11154160","11156760"," You don't have to be like, you don't have to be the guy that knows everything. "
"11157240","11161200"," You don't have to be the guy that's like doing the most complicated shit."
"11161500","11164700"," You don't have to be fucking explaining yourself to people how you're a rocket scientist on"
"11164700","11164920"," Twitter."
"11165560","11169420"," It's just it's not about that because then the fucking day I'm going to tell you what matters that"
"11169420","11170360"," you can pay your fucking bills. "

"11555560","11560600"," Spy is looking pretty, pretty bullish, believe it or not. "
"11561380","11564200"," The hero indicator is saying something different right now."
"11564860","11565880"," So let's take a look here."
"11566600","11569120"," Okay, the hero indicator is trailing off. "
"11569280","11571400"," It's been trailing off since 10, 30 or so."
"11572860","11578560"," And I'll be honest with you, if I was looking at this chart without looking at the book map, this"
"11578560","11581360"," is looking to me very bullish."
"11581400","11582880"," Now I know we can get rid of all this. "
"11583380","11584900"," We can get rid of all this stuff here."
"11586860","11590980"," And you'd say if you're a bear, you're going to be like, well cap, you're wrong."
"11591220","11593420"," This is a bear flag over here. "
"11597450","11598770"," And this is a swan move."
"11599630","11602010"," You're going to get your swan move right here, cap, you're getting fucked."
"11603730","11607990"," So here's your bear flag forming up right here, right?"
"11608470","11611650"," So what you're going to be looking for is a capitulation move. "
"11613790","11617450"," And usually it doesn't usually what happens to come up here, then it'll, then it'll bomb."
"11618610","11621790"," That's for bad positioning for bears to get into early."
"11622870","11624010"," But in reality, you want to get into here. "
"11624150","11627330"," And also if you're a bull, you're like, oh yeah, this is bullish heading up and in reality, it's"
"11627330","11627670"," going to reverse."
"11628490","11632470"," So that would be the expectation at some point that we would have this happen right here, okay?"
"11637830","11638670"," Clear that off."
"11638730","11640890"," So just be conscious of this bear flag forming. "
"11642190","11647830"," But this looks bullish to me, like to me on the surface and be like, yeah, if you took away"
"11647830","11653230"," this stuff over here, hold on, get rid of this stupid shit."
"11655170","11664670"," The reason why it looks bullish to me is because of this consolidation right here, boom, boom,"
"11665050","11669070"," boom, just this flat consolidation in here is demanding a move higher."
"11669630","11676170"," So what would I do in this position right here, what I'm looking at is I am going to, I"
"11676170","11679250"," see this, see the divergence that's going on down here. "
"11679250","11689050"," 442 67"

"11706490","11711650"," 442 86 Mm-hmm."
"11711750","11715150"," Yeah, it looks so bullish to me even though it's like a bear flag and even though it gets some"
"11715150","11725060"," diversions here Just calling at me it's like go ahead"
"11725060","11736740"," cap do it Take that trade cap Whoever"

"14016710","14021810"," So we're going to have inflation due to that happening, right, postponing a recession."
"14022690","14026410"," So we're going to try to manage inflation as long as possible. "
"14026890","14033030"," You and I, bulls and bears both know that if they were to fight inflation right now, that we would"
"14033030","14038550"," slip into some form of a recession, even if it was only a year or two, you would have all"
"14038550","14038970"," this shit out."
"14039090","14043350"," And so now I'm not saying this works, but I, but you and I both know what they're going to"
"14043350","14043550"," do."
"14043930","14048510"," You and I both know that they're going to try to extend this market now as long as they possibly"
"14048510","14051150"," can and squeeze whenever they can out of it. "
"14051790","14054110"," And it's probably tied to politics and power."
"14054710","14058210"," I was talking to somebody yesterday on the phone and I was like, you know what, what it what it"
"14058210","14066810"," really extends to is you've got the GS and you've got JPM and believe it or not, Shocker Jerome"
"14066810","14068730"," Powell, right has all these ties."
"14068990","14072830"," This good old boy network is so intertwined. "
"14073430","14075710"," They don't really care who the Senate is."
"14075790","14079550"," Well, they like they like an opposing Senate and opposing presidency, but they don't really care"
"14079550","14080310"," who the president is."
"14080590","14085450"," They care about power and money and they care about influence in our government. "
"14085950","14088990"," And you've got the government people that have like power right there."
"14089070","14090130"," They love it."
"14090950","14092330"," This is both sides of the aisle. "
"14092530","14099810"," So my point behind that is that it's in the interest of whoever is the Fed chair to keep that"
"14099810","14104350"," power so they can make more money for themselves and their banks that they're affiliated with."
"14104630","14111150"," Any of you out there that don't think that there is a complete fraudulent grip behind the scenes of"
"14111150","14117030"," our government or any company that's in power has never actually worked in a powerful position."
"14117030","14122790"," I can promise you I can attest to this that it's all greed and power behind the scenes. "
"14122790","14132770"," So you know that that's what's going on there for the little man or the main street guy."
"14133570","14134630"," There's no care in the world."
"14134970","14140690"," They don't care about what you're doing is if anything you're being you've got a gun held to your"
"14140690","14141090"," head now. "
"14142350","14147270"," Even if you have money, you have a gun held to your head saying sorry bud inflation's going through"
"14147270","14147610"," the roof."
"14148110","14149530"," You only have two choices."
"14151150","14153410"," We're going to try to temper inflation but it's still high. "
"14154130","14158990"," We're going to attempt right and you're going to lose money on the sidelines just through"
"14158990","14159510"," inflation."
"14160050","14163410"," So you have to put it into the stock market or into real estate."
"14163690","14164430"," You don't have any choice. "
"14164890","14168550"," Oh and by the way if you're poor you're just going to get bent over and fucked for the next"
"14168550","14169050"," couple of years."
"14169490","14173890"," That's basically what they're telling you and not only that the longer that they put it off."
"14174390","14176330"," We were talking yesterday about cars right. "
"14176770","14179130"," You start out you drive in your car and you miss an oil change."
"14179750","14181990"," Then you start to hear a noise right."
"14182730","14186590"," Then you end up blowing up your engine and when you blow up your engine it throws a rod through"
"14186590","14193110"," the engine in your transmission seizes up and now you've got a hole in the roof of your truck right"
"14193110","14193990"," of your car or something. "
"14194490","14198090"," It all started with not changing the oil in the truck or the car or whatever."
"14198630","14202050"," And the same thing applies at a basic sense to our stock market."
"14202710","14205830"," So when you're putting all the stuff you put your postponing QT. "
"14206130","14214270"," You're just doing minimal managing of inflation and price controls and you're doing you still have"
"14214270","14215290"," QT out there believe it or not."
"14215370","14216390"," We don't have any done it right."
"14218090","14219590"," And the rates are low. "
"14219950","14222470"," They're trying to manage this market as long as they possibly can."
"14222610","14227250"," But it's just like a vehicle at some point the longer that you put it off the more you'll actually"
"14227250","14231830"," have to do to repair the damage that's being done over time."
"14232650","14238390"," So that was my only point on the tail ends of the credit market. "
"14238730","14242870"," I know that the credit market will tell a different story if there's real risk in the market."
"14243870","14251650"," But you saw it the other day after FMC you saw the credit market respond to the bullishness the"
"14251650","14254470"," general bullishness of J-POW statement."
"14255970","14257110"," Everything turned back up. "
"14257390","14264410"," So do I care right now about the twos, the threes, the fives, the 20s, the 30s, not really."
"14265290","14269530"," I think they got I think instead of a Fed put you've got a credit put going in right now"
"14269530","14270130"," behind the scenes."
"14270650","14272190"," I think behind the scenes there's a credit put. "
"14272770","14277590"," I think that this market's going to be risk on until they break it which is bullshit too."
"14277830","14281790"," I mean I know it's bullshit you know it's bullshit but let's be honest."
"14282430","14283790"," Greed is taking over. "
"14288490","14290130"," Greed baby is taking over."
"14290690","14295510"," And we could still trade down to four zero five zero and this market's still risk on which is wild."
"14300710","14302630"," Let's move this over and put map on for y'all. "
"14305490","14306830"," We're going to get our four four three."
"14308890","14311110"," We're getting four four four four two eight eight."
"14311890","14312870"," Is that process?"

"15401110","15406470"," people to be able to wholesale house quick you know you like you meet other uh landlords and you"
"15406470","15410350"," meet homeowners and you meet sellers you meet attorneys and you have to go to court for different"
"15410350","15416450"," stupid shit um so you have to hire attorneys that know all out all this stuff and then they come"
"15416450","15420550"," and find you and they're like hey man i know you do this you do that can you you want"
"15420550","15425170"," to buy this and normally it has to do with like pain in our you know it's you know it's"
"15425170","15430110"," like if any of you guys are contractors out there if you get a job a commercial job it's usually"
"15430110","15434470"," a lot less stressful than working for a homeowner homeowners they're like they you know they don't"
"15434470","15439630"," know what they're doing they're not negotiate negotiate they don't understand uh business and"
"15439630","15445110"," oftentimes people don't want to deal with that shit right they don't want to deal with someone with"
"15445110","15450730"," a million different questions or i want to do a house inspection and it's contingent upon this and"
"15450730","15456250"," contingent upon that so a guy like me knows about foundations i know about drains i know about"
"15456250","15461150"," roofs i know about rehab costs so i just walk in take one quick look and go it's worth the"
"15461150","15471740"," money and we move forward from there okay"
"15474980","15480840"," yeah you can wholesale flip so that you're another scumbag if you're a wholesaler i'm not really a"
"15480840","15487460"," wholesaler i don't do that for profession uh but because of the uh stuff that i do i get asked"
"15487460","15496220"," to wholesale sometimes um some people do it as a profession believe it or not and it's actually"
"15496220","15502720"," basically what you're doing is you're holding a title uh as papers are passed for a brief moment if"
"15502720","15509940"," you own the house for uh no real time you're just introducing a seller to a buyer and so i"
"15509940","15516480"," introduced the money man with no hassling to someone that wants to sell fast and the title is"
"15516480","15522000"," passed to me and then to them and you get a finder's fee i think it's illegal what i've been"
"15522000","15531750"," told it is yeah christians a commercial painting contractor yeah yeah painting retail houses or"
"15531750","15538870"," not retail by like home order houses it's got to suck i mean the way you're making money there uh"
"15538870","15543370"," that you know what's funny too is like if you're a painter you want to paint like a house that's"
"15543370","15548370"," empty you want to be moving people's furniture fixing people's wiping people's walls down having"
"15548370","15556510"," people there having people critiquing you working you want to be like in out and you're in in out"
"15556510","15566440"," so it is"
"15566440","15574020"," um let's take a note right now on the market uh let's be a conscience of some stuff in the"
"15574020","15583180"," market right now so spa gamma has a ceiling on the market today of uh four four two"
"15583180","15591480"," five zero now even with that being known we can trade higher i want you to know that and that's"
"15591480","15599140"," because of the call and expansion on the market today when you see this uh expanded call expanded"
"15599140","15604600"," calls farther dated out farther outside the money we can trade higher i do want you to understand"
"15604600","15614580"," and realize that that the market can go up whether you know it"
"15614580","15620580"," or not the market can go up i want you to know that uh even though spa gamma said hey"
"15620580","15626060"," yeah four four two five zero today that was predicated upon a no expansion in calls the market"
"15626060","15631360"," we're seeing it's more advances than decliners in the market today we're seeing expanded call"
"15631360","15637200"," options on the market today so do i think four four uh two point five five is the end of"
"15637200","15643440"," today uh possible but it wouldn't shock me if we traded even higher today it wouldn't shock me to"
"15643440","15650740"," see us trade maybe to four four three eight six possible uh now if most if people that follow spa"
"15650740","15655380"," gamma don't know that we have call expansion right now just that alone might like the market roll"
"15655380","15662140"," over here and then the last thing to take into consideration would be that as we make our way"
"15662140","15672200"," closer uh to the end of the day because most of the moves haven't even been made yet you"
"15672200","15680220"," could see some steep reversals either up or down in the market at 3 p.m so the runway begins"
"15680220","15686200"," to run out not now but uh you know it's only one 19 in the afternoon but we so what"
"15686200","15690520"," we do have a we do have between one 30 we have basically an hour and a half hour and"

"15704200","15708360"," lungs if you feel like there's still lots of calls coming into the market right now uh but what i"

"15734240","15741160"," going to do on its call buying but i wouldn't shock me to to possibly see a stock that hasn't"
"15741160","15745800"," been shorted get shorted at 3 p.m so like let's say you've got a ticker that's been going up"
"15745800","15750700"," all year long or not all year old it's looked like since in november or something like that or"
"15750700","15767850"," maybe a stock that was shorted that didn't actually give back enough maybe you've"

"15797830","15802890"," that that ticker might get shorted if you get a ticker it's been going up uh for the past year"
"15804310","15808850"," there's a chance that ticker might get shorted today there's of that possibilities on the table so"

"16780280","16785900"," quick look and if we were to roll over let's let's have a thought process here what we're looking"

"16794040","16799520"," say we let's first first look at the book map so i'm hoping too when you guys are watching these"

"16819900","16824600"," i got my own book map and i'm not gonna i don't want to deal with people anymore and i"
"16824600","16828340"," got my own candlestick chart over here and i got my own description of this and of that and"
"16828340","16832960"," whatever you guys see i quote spock him every morning right this is like i could sell that shit not"
"16832960","16836920"," that shit but i could sell something like it in the background and make tons of money and i don't"
"16836920","16843120"," this is all stuff for you guys to become better traders out there over time okay so uh we're going"
"16843120","16847260"," to do this right now together right so we're looking at this right here we're looking at book map"
"16847260","16852140"," right now or this heat map right the dome we're going to take a look at pyre and we're going"
"16852140","16855940"," to say hey let's say we trade higher from here would be a price target with the expanded call range"
"16855940","16863500"," probably 445 do i guarantee we're getting a 445 no we're going to look for 445 as a bull as"
"16863500","16871980"," a target okay 445 as a as a as a possible top for today okay so we're going to bring"
"16871980","16875800"," a candlestick chart over we're not even looking at volume profile mark profile i haven't looked at"
"16875800","16879900"," that with you guys in the past uh week or so have i we usually we usually do it every"
"16879900","16885520"," day but i'll bring the volume mark profile for you guys another day because we layer that in two so"
"16885520","16889880"," we're looking at this candlestick chart here we made this nice beautiful move up we talked about"
"16889880","16896380"," can we can we repair we did we almost got to the price target of 44250 not quite but close"
"16896380","16902080"," enough and of course using hand grenades right we know that that was resistance this morning"
"16902080","16910280"," without any call expansion but there has been call expansion higher so but maybe i doubt we get"
"16910280","16916120"," here but let's just say let's just say hey cab i think we go up here okay i don't care"
"16916120","16921160"," if we do or we don't but you're going to be looking for or if we get weakness in the"
"16921160","16928760"," market you want some price targets right so we have some we have some price targets we got this one"
"16928760","16938420"," right here right we're going to go back in time a little bit we know we got this we got"
"16938420","16944200"," this part of the channel right here right we got that part of the channel so we got this one"
"16944200","16949600"," right here back down here we know that we've got uh levels that we already know about we've got"
"16949600","16955220"," resistance one down here at 440 we have the bottom of the channel so the the weakest we should be"
"16955220","16963340"," into the bell is let's call it at 43896 that's the price target for you okay and let's say we"
"16963340","16968680"," were weak because it let's see if hedging coming into the bell we're weak into monday you'd be"
"16968680","16977200"," looking for this same this big channel that we've been trading in since january right we got this"
"16977200","16984900"," right here that top right there get that little one right in here right so look at this below for"
"16984900","16992440"," a for a monday low right hold on here we have some way down here's what way down here 400"
"16993440","17000860"," but let's go back and just look at that same line that we had see the price started down here"
"17000860","17010200"," let's say into monday 432 63 and also 435 44 it's a big one right here 439"
"17010200","17017200"," 18 so if you're bearish at some point here if you let's say a short here and you start a"
"17017200","17024560"," short here you have so you put some stops in to your bearish right you get bearish from here down"
"17024560","17032080"," to 439 02 and if you have us put a stop in let's say if we put a stop in"
"17032080","17039560"," at 442 55 we start heading higher here if we break above 442 50 you have a stop if you're"
"17039560","17045920"," bearish because we'll probably trade at 445 up here if you're bearish here if you bearish your"
"17045920","17054220"," first stop is down here right 484 your next stop is 449 your next stop is 439 down below if"
"17054220","17059440"," you're bearish into monday then your price target for monday is going to be in case of hedging"
"17059440","17067480"," probably going to be somewhere down in here right 435 433"
"17067480","17075950"," this one's right down here right 430"
"17075950","17084130"," and 426 426 you'd look for just by just by the hedging that could come into the market"
"17084130","17093000"," so if you're bearish heading into 3pm 4pm"
"17093000","17101780"," these are your targets this is your this is your squeeze point 442 5550 and we'll confirm the"
"17101780","17110380"," squeeze point right now that's probably higher so 442 83 is your capitulation okay so if you're"
"17110380","17118520"," bear you don't want to be short above 443 12 you what you do is you close your short and"
"17118520","17128140"," you take it long to 445 hope that helps and let's look at"
"17128140","17134260"," what's been going on all day long there's a divergence here whether you know it or not you see that"
"17134260","17145860"," divergence there is a divergence in the market even though we're rotating right now we've talked"
"17145860","17152120"," in the past chase chase winter knows this right over time i've told chase and other traders here"
"17152120","17161400"," that over time you may not see the market move down with that divergence but eventually it does"
"17161400","17167220"," come home to roost eventually you do see that weakness in the market from the divergence this is"
"17167220","17174640"," OPEC so it might be fucking with it might be fucking with the with the actual price the true price"
"17174640","17183260"," of the market right now at this moment but even so the point would be that as we climb higher"
"17183260","17190020"," if we climb higher to 443 if we climb higher to 445 we're almost in touch of that 450 mark"
"17190020","17195480"," today we're not even waiting for monday tuesday wednesday of next week to have the 445 450 there"
"17195480","17200840"," are bears out there they're going to say oh you know what puts are cheap again they're getting"
"17200840","17209440"," cheap and we're also looking at the VIX it's bouncing off 24 10 if the VIX can get down to"
"17209440","17214440"," 20 it's prime time to be going short this market so if you're going to be the conservative bear"
"17214440","17220480"," then you're just waiting you just wait for 20 21 23 22 and you're going to catch a good short"
"17220480","17226180"," at some point down there I guarantee it that I'll guarantee if we get down to 20 on the VIX"
"17226180","17235660"," I'll fucking go short all in short at 20 all in short so you could take the short here where"
"17235660","17242040"," we are and uh or start to add to your short or long putts or whatever put spreads here in"
"17242040","17248580"," the money maybe so maybe they don't print today but if you're at you can already look at the VIX"
"17248580","17253760"," I mean why even bother with why even bother taking the short until the VIX hits 20 take the take"
"17253760","17268660"," the VIX to 20 take the market short it's almost guaranteed to print you're not"

"17338820","17348100"," late at 1238 I don't see the 1238s being late oh right here we're here 1247 yeah i'm not sure"
"17348100","17352240"," i'm probably on uh central time for some reason i probably just have to do some kind of a mechanic"
"17352240","17359980"," in here and make it eastern time it's a good question you see if i can uh figure the column"
"17359980","17369210"," uh hold on to change type pull car train time and sales nope that's not it"
"17369210","17378150"," hold on let me see if there's a uh cog that I can change it in you know position single"
"17378150","17384650"," view artist text i wonder why it says that that's a good question attached comments every window"
"17384650","17390810"," export data and column cvc file let's uh look at that it shouldn't it shouldn't be at that time"
"17390810","17397350"," i'll have to check that time in price i'm gonna have to check and see why it's probably has"
"17397350","17402070"," something to do with the mechanic there's a way for me to look at the um look inside of is"
"17402070","17411230"," it in here and figure the column we'll have to check and see change the type i don't know i'll"
"17411230","17417290"," flick that up you know what i'll do is i'll ask uh uh the support why that is health to"
"17417290","17425350"," ask support probably has something to do where it's get the memo that we went to uh maybe i'm"
"17425350","17432130"," betting is that it didn't get the memo that we're on um daylight savings time yet that's my bet"
"17432130","17441940"," good question didn't sg say"
"17441940","17450340"," next week should be weak no so what sg said chase good question chase so what sg said was that"
"17450340","17460300"," uh when we get above negative gamma and we get above volatility right so you've got um let me"
"17460300","17471790"," i'll draw this for you so here it's a good question chase okay so uh"
"17471790","17478430"," so sorry so gamma levels change day in day out slightly and over time to a large sense so it's"
"17478430","17488190"," hard to hard to show on a on a horizontal line but basically the regime is uh that negative"
"17488190","17498100"," gamma basically being pretty basic this is all negative down here okay so this is all like negative"
"17498100","17507880"," gamma or all in here is all negative gamma all in here here is positive gamma up in here well"
"17507880","17513760"," it's basically even higher it's up in there and there's a volatility zone i'm being i'm being lit"
"17513760","17522560"," don't this is an example in here's a volatility zone okay so uh you're you're always looking for"
"17522560","17528160"," volatility we have lots of volatility on here and expecting to celebrate rip down here in here is"
"17528160","17534000"," volatility sharp moves up and down right violence and then up here right we have what's called"
"17534000","17540660"," volatility crush right uh the volatility gets crushed and when you see volatility it crushed um"
"17540660","17546760"," which which we're starting to move into that into that into that right now right home and get rid"
"17546760","17558680"," of this so on a smaller time frame once we're above negative gamma"
"17558680","17567180"," and a volatility band we move into we move into positive gamma pair right uh 440 and above is"
"17567180","17575700"," positive gamma and what happens is volatility gets crushed so let's say right now the VIX is at 24"
"17575700","17582540"," I think and we know that the bottom of VIX is probably 20 and we don't have a lot of"
"17582540","17591320"," room in the basic terms we have a lot of room to go from 440 to 450 from 24 25"
"17591320","17599400"," to 20 so what happens is your moves become smaller your implied volatility implied moves during"
"17599400","17606280"," each day become less instead of making 100 point moves uh 125 point moves each day you might make"
"17606280","17612480"," 20 or 30 you might only move a point or 10 points you might only move a little bit each"
"17612480","17620160"," day as we move our way up to this 450 price target up here so when they say the market"
"17620160","17627080"," is weak when he says that or anyone says that what they're really saying to is you're not going to"
"17627080","17634980"," see large moves higher like you do in a volatility zone okay when this volatility zone we're seeing"
"17634980","17639660"," that when you're breaking out of negative positive gamma same thing happens in the inverse we start"
"17639660","17647020"," to reverse you'll see bigger moves down in this zone here and you'll see more uh more sell the rips"
"17647020","17652460"," as we head back down it's negative gamma so i don't think explains it well or easy or simply but"
"17652460","17661800"," the point would be that from 440 and above we've entered a positive gamma regime and that the move"
"17661800","17669660"," from 440 to 450 shouldn't be violent you shouldn't see like a face ripper to 450 you should see"
"17669660","17676880"," some kind of uh sideways action and then you should see slight moves up until we finally make it to"
"17676880","17683280"," 450 now if we do see some violent moves up to 450 that would imply that we're now buying calls"
"17683280","17689940"," not at 450 we're buying them above it for 60 or even higher at 470 if you were to see"
"17691100","17697360"," waterfall calls coming at 470 or 480 you would then see more violent moves up until we get back"
"17697360","17704440"," into another move because what that's doing is it's opening up the VIX to go down below 20 now to"
"17704440","17709740"," like 10 or 15 or something like that i don't see that happening but theoretically that would be the"
"17709740","17716480"," the implication so from here you don't have a lot of VIX to play with you have volatility being"
"17716480","17724680"," crushed and you will have smaller moves up so weaker doesn't really mean what it means above 440 in"
"17724680","17728640"," the reason why we say things like yesterday we're saying hey you don't want to close well just to"
"17728640","17733000"," buy the fucking dip at 336 or 436 and hey you really want to see the bulls be above 440"
"17733000","17740660"," so that we can then make that move to 450 we're not in as much danger of trading lower like"
"17740660","17745260"," we are involved in a volatility zone and these volatility zones you make violent moves up and down"
"17745260","17750400"," this works both ways for bulls and bears but once we get up above a certain area if that area"
"17750400","17756600"," is held you should see a regime where we trade higher to 450 and it should be slow unless unless"
"17756600","17765020"," you see cascading waterfall calls heading higher okay even if you see puts come on they should come"
"17765020","17771720"," in slowly in that 440 to 450 range and then you'd see a waterfall puts come in once we get"
"17771720","17778020"," close to that 450 and you still need more mechanics to work to get to 450 you can't have calls"
"17778020","17784940"," just that 450 you have to see have people buying the underlying components of the spy and like the"
"17784940","17792980"," the actual real buying of stock and shares and you have to see the real buying of outside the money"
"17792980","17798680"," farther dated out calls that works and that works all for bears too so they buy puts down a 405"
"17798680","17804120"," we haven't seen we haven't seen 405 the lowest we saw was 413 right so you want so you see"
"17804120","17810780"," that same thing works in the bottom if you'd seen a cascade of puts down to 360 370 380 we"
"17810780","17816020"," would definitely would have seen 480 back here in this time frame so there's absolute gamma or"
"17816020","17821980"," absolute gamma puts absolute gamma calls there's absolute gamma or there's foot walls and call"
"17821980","17827740"," walls it's basically and then our basic sense when you hear people say fill a bag up it's that the"
"17827740","17832880"," next person's going to come up by this bag and it's this patient of somebody else wanting to get"
"17832880","17838440"," their back filled even lower or even higher okay i don't know if explain that better today than i"
"17838440","17847150"," did yesterday i'm not as tired today and if it if you don't get it i'll keep saying it to"
"17847150","17856580"," you do a little bit of a role going on a little bit of consolidation on the spy right now"
"17856580","17862120"," we are running out of runway into the close i can't tell you at this point if we trade higher"
"17862120","17867020"," in the last hour from three to four p.m i'm unsure the trades that i've taken today i've made"
"17867020","17873520"," my money if i see anything that looks like a good trade i'll take it with you but this moment"
"17873520","17885300"," i'm not ready to take a trade i hope"
"17887190","17891950"," this is helping explain if i'm not explaining it well maybe one of you guys can explain it better"
"17891950","17898550"," inside stream or inside discord i hope that's the simple way to explain things i'm trying to keep"
"17898550","17903350"," things simple rather than rather more because it's more complex the more you know about this stuff"
"17903350","17909390"," the more complicated it gets because there's other shit mechanics in the background so like you got"
"17909390","17914350"," banks that sometimes that should expire you got banks sometimes monetize you got banks that have"
"17914350","17922070"," been short since the top they've been short since 480 and so this move today means nothing to them"
"17922070","17927990"," they'll still take profit off of this move higher today some banks leave their leave their stuff on"
"17927990","17933270"," some banks are letting off their shorts today the yesterday day before they're letting off right"
"17933270","17939310"," taking profit they might roll those shorts those profits from shorts not even into the cash market"
"17939310","17944970"," you might not actually see hedging in the cash market you might see hedging in the futures market"
"17944970","17950230"," uh and not in cash so there's ways from the height there's all kinds of other complicated shit but"
"17950230","17956490"," on a basic sense basic level i'm hoping that this explains how the market moves uh and there's"
"17956490","17964090"," other things like real money selling real money buying can pretty much uh wipe out anything about"
"17964090","17969110"," options running because oftentimes options run this market but there are times in this market where"
"17969110","17973830"," real money buying and real money selling trumps any kind of options are in the market and we're"
"17973830","17978770"," seeing that right now today right we're seeing the hair indicator go down uh be divergent not"
"17978770","17987050"," moving up as it heads up as it's going up currently uh but even so it's been diverging all day"
"17987050","17991370"," long and yet you see the market going up so that's called real money buying it's when real money"
"17991370","17998730"," buying is stepping into the market regardless of call selling or put buying we just ricochet it off"
"17998730","18008190"," 442 48 447 just a huge ricochet you see that holy shit look at that swan"

"19610200","19617180"," yeah volume uh my my best your best days to actually see the market go up are on low volume"
"19617180","19623340"," days with more buyers in the market on but days like say with large volume you typically don't see"
"19623340","19628760"," large moves higher and then there's a combination of options buying that impacts as well short"
"19628760","19637720"," covering plus option buying and real money buying makes that vanna uh rally explode um where we"
"19637720","19645340"," haven't seen that uh in the past three months we're starting to see it the past three days turning"
"19654460","19660560"," it more volatile as we head into this uh two o'clock hour 226 hour be careful in here uh"
"19660560","19669140"," you're starting to see banks uh make large moves we could make a move higher to 445 because we've"
"19669140","19674480"," seen that call expansion we talked about it earlier whether you could see this move to 445 but I do"
"19674480","19683020"," want to warn you uh if we do make that move higher pull in here you bring this over for"
"19683020","19690760"," you guys I do want to warn you even though we're consolidating down in here we can make them move"
"19690760","19695340"," higher there's there's no reason why we can't get violence in here do not be in the wrong side of"
"19695340","19701040"," trades as the day moves forward if you are a bull and you're like hey I want that 445 cap"
"19702200","19706980"," um the safest way to do it is to wait for a vault to move move down to take it"
"19706980","19710980"," higher rather than just saying hey I'm gonna buy right here cap or I'm gonna buy right over here"
"19710980","19716500"," cap wait for those vaults volatile moves down to take it higher uh don't be didle in the middle"
"19716500","19726420"," specifically today uh don't just don't do it if we"
"19726420","19738030"," got closer to 450 I wonder if we do see that 4050 by the 31st it"
"19738030","19753300"," wouldn't shock me and if"
"19753300","19757500"," you want to be if you want to get crazy I don't think it's I'm trying to end my mind"
"19757500","19764060"," I'm trying to calculate the odds of this happening I think it's I think there's too much ball crush"
"19764060","19771020"," but it's like too far outside the money my first instinct is to be like hey buy some 445 C's"
"19774260","19780940"," because those could print like 500 600 percent but it's so like this weird ball crush thing it"
"19780940","19786800"," fucks with the options paying you might just be better off buying in the money call if you're gonna"
"19786800","19792920"," even take it to there if you're like hey we're gonna go to 445 you might be better off making"
"19792920","19800700"," your money though buying slightly in the money like 440s and not by the 445s because they're dirt"
"19800700","19810700"," cheap they're like six cents um like six pennies but I'm considering it right"
"19810700","19818900"," now considering if this can actually make that move higher or does it just they're worth like what"
"19818900","19823600"," 12 cents at the bell we are on Friday they could be they could be burned worthless and we touch"
"19823600","19834260"," 445 right yeah so it might be better to get some spreads it might be better to get 445s"
"19834260","19839220"," dated for Monday it might be better for you to make the money rather than getting your zero dates"
"19839220","19845580"," burned today it's a very touchy subject going up here and you're probably only good taking those"
"19845580","19850660"," for the actual move itself otherwise you're just gonna tear off any profits to move up make that"
"19850660","19860520"," move higher if we do make that move higher I like this consolidation in here by the way let me"
"19860520","19870520"," I like that consolidation a lot still showing on book map that's"
"19870520","19880430"," there right we got 443 still have sellers there can"
"19880430","19894280"," we get to 445 this is like the top of the range up here can"
"19895720","19908750"," we get up there and I don't know I"
"19908750","19922920"," don't know if we can get there to 445 that's a tough call it's"
"19922920","19927300"," a tough call but I'd really like to see happen I'll be honest with you I'd really like to see"
"19927300","19933600"," like I'll be honest I'm digging from the from a market makers perspective I'd really like to see"
"19936320","19946180"," I'd really like to see like market makers burn 442s or burn 440s like burn the fucking value"
"19946180","19954780"," out of them and then buy the 440s for the move to 445 if it goes there and then you'd"
"19954780","19964780"," see you'd at least get some money on that trade rather than like say oh I'm gonna buy"
"19964780","19969060"," and then it doesn't actually it just prints like a penny or two kind of get fucked on here I"
"19969060","19979460"," know what I'm from you keep your eyes back on 440s and 442s match"
"19979460","19987260"," them to the chart down here if there's a sell-down and if it only goes like if it only"
"19987260","19996920"," goes like 440 by the 442s if it goes down to 441 excuse me"
"19996920","20005100"," it goes down to 440 then by the by the 440 C's for a stretch higher if we do get"
"20005100","20009680"," that stretch higher my only concern here is that everybody knows that everybody knows that"
"20009680","20017320"," everybody knows that 440 250 is the ceiling when in fact it probably isn't it might just this might"
"20017320","20025640"," just be like this might this level here just might be trader sentiment more than the ability to get"
"20025640","20034880"," up there ability to get up there I guess we'll monitor it and see how it goes see if we"
"20034880","20052580"," can actually make that trade higher check"
"20052580","20056860"," in is asking with so much profit making this week will there be a lot of selling in the last"
"20056860","20066400"," hour for taking profits off the table okay so the question about the question about the the check"
"20066400","20073720"," is asking it's not about profit taking it isn't it's more it there's a so there's some things you"
"20073720","20080180"," have to understand okay so we're up now in an area of low volatility we are now above volatility"
"20080180","20084760"," we're now actually in some positive gamma the low end of positive gamma but we are in some positive"
"20084760","20092320"," gamma so we to your your bias should be for an upside move from here not for a downside move"
"20092320","20098760"," your bias should be an upside move to 450 it should take a long time to get there now with"
"20098760","20103280"," that being said the he makes a good point a very fair point right we should be taking profit off"
"20103280","20110740"," the tables or off the table here what my thought process here is that we get up here and it"
"20110740","20120040"," gives the ability for the market or for the banks to hedge the market where puts are cheap and they"
"20120040","20124960"," want to get the best price they possibly can so it's anywhere we're from here to 450 so they could"
"20124960","20131900"," add some on now they could add some at 445 they give it some at 450 so there would be"
"20131900","20137400"," an impact slightly in the market but it wouldn't necessarily mean that the market trades down from"
"20137400","20143700"," here to the depths of hell what they would do is add those on and then you would want to"
"20143700","20151540"," put waterfall to follow it to actually move the market to move the market down deeper my so my"
"20151540","20157540"," thought is no my thought is that they're going to pump this market up as high as they can get"
"20157540","20163000"," it and then at three o'clock hour they're going to just put some hedging on the market at a"
"20163000","20169560"," very good price that's what I think because we head into that three o'clock hour bring it back over"
"20169560","20175200"," for you you want it you don't buy shorts here right you can buy them up here if you can"
"20175200","20181740"," if you can but they'll buy them here it's not like time to say I'm not crystal ball for where"
"20181740","20185380"," the banks are comfortable buying they don't give a fine fucking a time frame if they buy them here"
"20185380","20190540"," at 450 they'll just keep adding them as adding them as we go up and then add more puts to"
"20190540","20195360"," the market so I think we I think we trade higher I think there's a fair chance of us getting"
"20195360","20220930"," a 445 question is which which options are you buying for that right up so"
"20220930","20226110"," we'll see if we can break through break higher there's no real price target here above on the on"
"20226110","20231850"," the map here there's no real resistance or excuse me there's no real resistance once we get above"
"20231850","20238330"," 443 I don't see a wall higher anything that I see higher is the end of volatility around 445 above"
"20238330","20249430"," so we'll"
"20249430","20274400"," see if there's some capitulation moves from see"
"20274400","20277820"," if you get a nice capitulation move here if they can trade higher we're looking for a price target"
"20277820","20287600"," of 44290 sorry I'm making some trades here in the"
"20287600","20297500"," background I'm trying to go along here fast scalping"

"20320880","20330680"," 63 baby keep it moving okay so we are now breaking through the what we think was really we"
"20330680","20337680"," established this morning at the open resistance would be at 442.50 we're now trading higher at 442 "
"20337680","20347460",".64 we talked about the call expansion on the market to allow us to trade higher"
"20347460","20356800"," and then we discussed possibly trading to 445 we do see volatility to 445 today at this point if we"
"20356800","20362700"," can break above we do need to break above and wear out these sellers at again they're moving up now"
"20362700","20376940"," 442.88 could see a nice squeeze here I'm"
"20376940","20390980"," going to look at fubo absolutely my"

"20401130","20411120"," going up 442 uh market can go down quite a bit going forward uh yeah I still think"
"20411120","20416300"," that we're going to hit 405 I still think we're going to hit 405 zero and I still think we're"
"20416300","20427520"," bullish doing it hell yeah I"
"20427520","20433460"," think we can I think we can trade for close to 450 probably won't hit it probably like 448 and"
"20433460","20438540"," then I think we can easily go back down to 4050 well we didn't I agree with that milk capitulation"
