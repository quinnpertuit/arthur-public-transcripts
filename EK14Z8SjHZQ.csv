"382030","386250"," The tornadoes were getting some wild ones huge huge water. "
"388550","391370"," Had to go outside yesterday and try to help with those."
"391810","394790"," The whole neighborhood had storm drains that were clogged up so."
"395550","397510"," Gotta get in the truck go down the road. "

"406470","408450"," So I have an RV and I was outside."
"408830","411470"," I was like, I didn't expect the storm and."
"413710","417810"," Wasn't paying attention, I guess, and my RV is kind of open ish. "
"419510","423430"," And I've got stuff outside from it and I'm I was like, God, it's not going to rain or nothing"
"423430","423870"," like that."
"424130","427270"," So I'm running outside yesterday to go check on it."
"429090","431590"," And a lightning strike was like. "
"432690","434410"," Maybe a hundred meters away from me."
"435310","436910"," Hair went right straight up in the air."
"437010","439870"," I like freaked out panic. "
"440350","444190"," I was like, Oh shit."
"447100","448660"," Yeah, I thought about a power wall."
"451540","454780"," I'm actually considered I've got some we'll talk about solar today. "
"454920","456220"," My solar options and stuff."
"457660","459420"," I'm not an I'm not anti solar."
"459700","461580"," It's it's where it's part of it. "
"461740","463260"," It's complicated where I live."
"464720","467740"," I'm from a West where it's not as complicated here."
"467900","468440"," It's way complicated. "
"472030","473650"," So give me just a second here."
"475210","477290"," I got a few more things to do."
"507160","508520"," Okay, all that is done there. "
"508660","509800"," All that is done there."
"511720","512799"," Everything is done."
"512960","514760"," They're good more into all of the other out there right now. "
"519299","519700"," Okay."
"528740","529980"," Well, it's not so much."
"530520","531800"," We got a bunch of stuff to go over here. "
"536300","538240"," There's there's I want to talk about a couple of things."
"538260","539100"," I'm just going to bring it up."
"539360","541080"," Maybe they have them on this program here. "
"542940","544880"," We got a couple of things I got to do with you this morning."
"545040","546120"," I have a chance to do with you."
"548620","550160"," We had some stuff to talk about. "
"550580","551680"," Not that we can't."
"551800","553360"," I do want to talk to people out there."
"554180","555560"," Talking about Bollinger bands. "
"563100","565160"," So there's an idea before we even go any further."
"565160","566560"," Let's look at a five day."
"567080","568640"," We'll do we'll do some Bollinger bands. "
"569980","570920"," So all right."
"570960","572600"," So a couple of things going to look at here."
"574440","579020"," That nice R2 tag above is the levels from yesterday just came up here. "
"579720","580560"," Slammed up here."
"582780","584660"," There's a reason we slammed up here."
"584800","586280"," There's two reasons I'm going to explain. "
"586920","591960"," So this is a natural selling place for the S&P 500 right in here."
"593320","594900"," Natural place to sell."
"595180","596340"," Does that mean we can't come from here?"
"596620","598580"," No, we can continue to go up here. "
"598580","601620"," We can grind up from here if we want."
"602560","604780"," We can pull back for a nice."
"605680","609480"," For some consolidation to make a move higher. "
"609760","611560"," This is a nuance."
"612540","614600"," Something nuanced that you need to understand."
"615880","617060"," And we'll look at this. "
"617200","618680"," We're going to look at this in just a moment here, but."
"619240","620880"," Let's get some levels done for today."
"620940","621880"," We're going to talk about. "
"623400","627720"," The nuance of the stock market, what it means."
"629600","635060"," To have a nuanced opinion of where we are, where we can go."
"635440","636340"," Is this the top?"
"636660","637680"," Is it not the top?"
"637880","639220"," How much of a top is it?"
"639540","643860"," I got to take some of these out for the day because the shit just gets in the way. "
"646600","648100"," What kind of a top is it?"
"648260","649200"," Can we grind from here?"
"649620","650760"," We can grind from here."
"651520","654480"," There's nothing same if you get out and close any of this shit, especially."
"657560","658840"," We get rid of some of this stuff. "
"658960","660440"," You can see that yellow band above."
"665390","666610"," So we can grind here."
"666870","667770"," That's, that's the key. "
"667990","669710"," Even with the people who are tied with Bollinger bands."
"669930","672150"," I'm like, they mean something and they don't."
"672830","674910"," First of all, just where we are right now. "
"676910","678630"," Well, let me get these levels down."
"678750","683130"," We'll make this easy because I'm tired of like, not tired by like, I don't like doing this without"
"683130","683890"," everything in place."
"684530","686170"," So your pinpoint for today is 410. "
"688230","691110"," 410.25. Okay, it's come up a little bit, right?"
"691310","692390"," This is positive for bulls."
"693130","694690"," What do you take away from this?"
"694690","696590"," Oh, what, what you take away from this."
"697510","698670"," We already tagged this one. "
"698710","699530"," We're just going to get rid of it."
"700290","702450"," What you're going to take away from this is that we're moving up."
"702610","704250"," Number one, we're moving up right now. "
"704350","704430"," Okay."
"704710","705930"," Pivot has moved up today."
"708360","709500"," Your pivot has moved up. "
"709580","711500"," It's a big, it's a big thing for a bull."
"711680","712760"," It means the market is supportive."
"713280","716760"," Whether you want to admit that, not admit that, whatever it is you want to do. "
"717420","719660"," Whatever you take away from that, the market is moving up."
"719860","720040"," Okay."
"720100","722980"," This also implies that the call wall is moving up. "
"722980","724260"," Even if people tell you it's not."
"725480","727480"," 412.07 is your next target above."
"732500","733220"," Right there. "
"733500","735260"," We basically tagged it, right?"
"735620","738920"," Basically tagged it this morning, right off the open or not the open, but just a few minutes ago,"
"738920","739420"," we tagged it."
"740220","741800"," 412.07 is R1."
"742140","752140"," And then R2 for the day is 413.18. Getting kind of"
"752140","753340"," tight up here now, right?"
"754160","755860"," And then the R3 is 415 flat. "
"757620","759160"," This is where your squeeze comes into play."
"760020","760680"," If we squeeze."
"761560","763940"," This is where your squeeze comes into play where. "
"765960","770060"," We get up in these Bollinger bands and you get some good news and boom, we just do this one,"
"770160","770660"," squeeze up."
"771000","772160"," Now I'm going to tell you some."
"772260","775280"," If we squeeze up here, this is an automatic short. "
"776660","778180"," I want you to know that right now."
"778280","779120"," This is an automatic short."
"779200","779920"," I'm going to write it up here. "
"780460","783220"," In my view, this is a real one."
"783400","784920"," This is an automatic short."
"786460","788120"," Or at least for right now it is. "
"791720","794660"," For right now, for today, this is an automatic short of air and R3."
"794780","795580"," We squeeze up here."
"795860","797260"," And I'll explain to you why here in a minute. "
"798020","800480"," And even if it is an automatic short, how far does it go down?"
"800820","801440"," What does it mean?"
"804420","814320"," Down here for your support levels, you've got 409.14. And this is why I don't necessarily like"
"814320","814780"," trading."
"817140","824960"," I don't like trading this action typically because what happens is you're chasing a melt up that"
"824960","828040"," you don't feel comfortable chasing."
"828520","833060"," So you have to have like, you have your longs on and then you've got, and then you end up"
"833060","839170"," having, oh man, this is, I don't like this either. "
"841310","844550"," This is where you end up having an outsider signal move to the downside."
"845850","848470"," Now, tight trading range, right, generally speaking."
"849490","855550"," What I don't like about trading melt ups is that the only way that I mentally can trade them is"
"855550","859210"," I take the longs and then I put a shitty 10 cent hedge on. "
"861780","862860"," And I leave it on."
"863200","867500"," Yesterday I cut a loose at one point because I knew we weren't going down anymore, but we're like,"
"867520","873180"," I got a hedge on right now for some downside protection for just just an ass blaster move down"
"873180","873460"," here."
"874880","877780"," It's the only way that I feel confident trading a melt up. "
"877880","885540"," Otherwise, what I used to do is I would know the melt up was coming to grind higher."
"885900","889360"," You'll see people on social media be like, you're crazy trading that."
"889880","890800"," You can trade it. "
"891120","893020"," You can easily trade it on the long side."
"894680","897580"," You can take the long new all the way up, have a 10 cent hedge."
"899140","903800"," If it starts fucking rolling and getting nasty at any point, you're going to be safe. "
"903840","905220"," You're going to at least pay for your trade."
"905900","911380"," So you can have the risk on comfortably in this market, even in a melt up type situation."
"912360","913900"," To hear your levels for today. "
"914980","916480"," Now we're going to look at some other stuff."
"916620","917980"," You just be aware that well, thanks."
"918180","920500"," Malpass is currently speaking at the Atlantic Council Council. "
"921140","922860"," We will get the video out as soon as possible."
"923540","927320"," We'll get some other stuff we'll look at here."
"931490","934870"," 408.99. This is the one you really need to know. "
"940240","943320"," This is the magic number if you're if you are a fucking bear."
"947220","948780"," 408.99 you need to know."
"950820","952140"," This is your magic number. "
"952300","953980"," You need to get underneath this right here."
"954800","956580"," Otherwise trend is still on."
"957600","958580"," Dips are supportive. "
"959020","961080"," Dips are to be bought at all that stuff."
"961280","963180"," I could do not like this is trend right here."
"965780","967060"," This is the magic number. "
"973350","977290"," We talked about this about tech ad nauseam, right?"
"977530","982130"," They just keep buying this number buying this number buying this number like it's nobody's business"
"982130","983070"," way down here."
"983870","984770"," Our early trend."
"987350","990810"," Now, let's see if we can get a Bollinger Band up here to show you guys some stuff here. "
"991690","993190"," Let's go back to the one minute really quick."
"994110","996050"," And we've got no real decision here, do we?"
"996890","998610"," Nothing that's tradable here, right?"
"1000590","1003090"," There's nothing currently at this moment that's tradable."
"1003410","1005570"," Now, see if they have Bollinger Bands here. "
"1007090","1013540"," All indicators that Bollinger Bands don't know if they do or don't."
"1018490","1019910"," Right there, Bollinger Bands."
"1020170","1020590"," All right, cool. "
"1021870","1023290"," All right, so on a daily."
"1031660","1032819"," Can you guys see that?"
"1032980","1034200"," Let's see if you guys can see that."
"1034619","1036079"," Maybe it's easier to do an SPX. "
"1040040","1040680"," That's easier."
"1041740","1042339"," Much better."
"1043500","1049040"," So on Bollinger Bands, I need you to know that real quick. "
"1049260","1050540"," These are Bollinger Bands right here."
"1052420","1058220"," We can grind this all the way up is the point that I want to need to make to."
"1058480","1061260"," Let me see if I can make this a fatter line here. "
"1061640","1068260"," Length, input, source, standard deviation, style, upper, band, line, style, size."
"1069560","1071180"," Just make this really fat right here."
"1073040","1076720"," Let's take this yellow so you can see it or green. "
"1078520","1078980"," Right there, done."
"1079600","1081120"," Do you see this line right here?"
"1082320","1083860"," I want you to know something."
"1084240","1086880"," I want you to, I can show you people like that. "
"1087080","1088040"," This is a rare thing."
"1088200","1089700"," I'm like, like, no, no, no, it's not."
"1090640","1092480"," Now, there's some caveats here. "
"1094940","1097120"," We can trade this right up."
"1097300","1102540"," Believe it or not, we can trade this with green bars all the way up."
"1103100","1103880"," All the way up. "
"1103920","1108900"," We can go all the way up into Friday and tag and fill this gap above here."
"1108980","1113360"," We can grind this right up this Bollinger Band and stay right on it."
"1114020","1114980"," That's a melt up. "
"1115200","1115980"," Do you get what I'm saying?"
"1116740","1118820"," And there's nothing stopping us from doing that."
"1119000","1119440"," Nothing."
"1119680","1126040"," And there's nothing in the Bollinger Bands that stop us from that melt up into 4200. "
"1130720","1132400"," So that's a concern, right?"
"1132580","1136100"," If you're a bear, you're like, well, what do I do here?"
"1136100","1137920"," Do I just start insta-shorting this?"
"1138580","1144640"," And then I get pushed back and we squeeze, insta-short, squeeze, insta-short, squeeze, insta-short,"
"1145340","1145400"," squeeze."
"1146660","1150540"," So just off of just looking at Bollinger Bands, this doesn't really tell you enough."
"1151580","1153740"," We can grind this the entire way up. "
"1154100","1155080"," I assure you of that."
"1155320","1162040"," Now, with that said, let me get rid of that Bollinger Band for a minute here."
"1166600","1170740"," With that said, get rid of this shit here. "
"1171500","1172760"," Get rid of all this noise right here."
"1175460","1179840"," Something key for you to look at here is, do all that right there."
"1181940","1182780"," Get that helps. "
"1184640","1185520"," Get rid of this."
"1186060","1187060"," You can see this right here."
"1187200","1188140"," This top right here, right?"
"1191160","1193960"," You know that they teed off right here, right?"
"1197740","1200180"," And you know that they're going to look. "
"1200360","1201320"," These are places now."
"1201500","1204940"," Traditional charting doesn't prove itself, but it is."
"1205420","1207100"," Traditional charting is like Elliot Wave. "
"1208020","1209280"," It's like technical analysis."
"1209740","1216080"," It's like anything out there that you know that people are a group of people are going to trade to"
"1216080","1216600"," these things."
"1217420","1227160"," It doesn't mean they always work, but it does mean to expect buyers or sellers at key"
"1227160","1228400"," numbers, key levels. "
"1229160","1230760"," And this is SPX, right?"
"1230880","1232460"," So just right in here."
"1233560","1235900"," You see that perfect tag right there?"
"1236420","1238060"," You see how that's not really perfect?"
"1238140","1239480"," I could bring that down a little bit."
"1240520","1241480"," Right there. "
"1242940","1247960"," And if you were to use this on ES in the overnight, if you were to chart this right on"
"1247960","1251700"," ES in the overnight, that pin strike that was right here."
"1252520","1257280"," It's just taking exactly where we sold off in premarket today."
"1257780","1258240"," Okay. "
"1258800","1267800"," So you're going to expect sellers today to step in above here at 4149.72. Regardless if we continue"
"1267800","1268340"," higher."
"1268720","1273460"," So if we come up here, you're going to expect right in here and you're going to expect."
"1273860","1275160"," Well, peers just be like, fuck it. "
"1275200","1275760"," We're piling in."
"1276120","1277780"," If fuck a little pile in right here."
"1279440","1280820"," Regardless, that's what they're going to do. "
"1281660","1283280"," They're going to do an SPX."
"1283280","1286960"," They're going to do an ES and we already tagged it this morning in ES."
"1287280","1289460"," So that's what you saw was in premarket. "
"1289460","1293720"," You saw those sellers in ES immediately step in and give a cell."
"1296800","1299220"," And so that's what you're seeing this morning on spy."
"1299500","1301140"," I'm going to show you really quick on spy. "
"1303020","1307000"," So when you see like the H lines and why do we have the seller step in at this time"
"1307000","1307480"," this morning?"
"1308140","1308880"," That's the reason."
"1308880","1311360"," So right in here, here we're trying to sell it right now."
"1312240","1313700"," And just right up in here. "
"1314240","1320160"," This is where that line was on ES that translated translated to spy this morning."
"1321400","1325400"," And you see these sellers stepping right back in like it's nobody's business."
"1325660","1325820"," Okay. "
"1326260","1332480"," I stepped in selling here and they're going to take every opportunity now to sell this market right"
"1332480","1333400"," where we are."
"1333640","1333840"," Okay."
"1335900","1338680"," Now with that said, let me finish here. "
"1339960","1348560"," With that said, these sellers want to get us down into."
"1349860","1351200"," Not just the hourly."
"1353140","1354840"," But underneath the hourly. "
"1355060","1356780"," So they want price to get under here."
"1357780","1358200"," Right."
"1358380","1360700"," So they can actually take control of this market. "
"1361200","1363540"," And I'm going to show it to you in another chart what I'm talking about."
"1363600","1364920"," This is green line right here."
"1364980","1366800"," We're going to talk about why this matters to you. "
"1366800","1370340"," When I was to expect your comments from bank of England's pill, who gives the speech at the"
"1370340","1375360"," international center for monetary and bank studies, public lecture inflation, persistence and"
"1375360","1375960"," monetary policy."
"1375960","1377640"," I'm going to say why it matters to you."
"1377800","1379800"," If you're a bull, a bear, it doesn't matter. "
"1379940","1383360"," It's because of this monster taking place to having move."
"1384820","1389280"," Remember when I posted on fin to it and I was on fin to it and I go six trigger."
"1391400","1392160"," Right here. "
"1393280","1396780"," Post on fin to it."
"1396780","1398160"," We're not going to stop."
"1398380","1399720"," It's just going to rip faces off. "
"1399920","1401300"," And what do we do?"
"1401400","1402600"," We rip faces off, right?"
"1403300","1404560"," Didn't even get to the early."
"1404780","1405760"," Didn't even get to the early."
"1405780","1406660"," Didn't even get to the early. "
"1406660","1407360"," Didn't even get to the early."
"1407360","1408140"," Didn't even get to the early."
"1408580","1411960"," And right now for the first time, we're kind of coming back to it. "
"1412020","1412580"," You see how."
"1415130","1418710"," See how we really like right here, bought like nobody's business."
"1419930","1420390"," Right here. "
"1421090","1425270"," Trying to get to this hourly and trade price underneath it."
"1426270","1428210"," And bears really, I'll be honest."
"1428450","1430910"," If you're a fucking bear and you're trying to short this shit. "
"1431670","1432910"," Your best trade."
"1433090","1434390"," I talk about this all the time."
"1434590","1439690"," Your best trade is for price to get underneath and then confirm. "
"1440610","1442130"," The move down."
"1442570","1443890"," This is where the money is."
"1444390","1447230"," This is where the risk free trading is. "
"1447530","1450990"," So you break under it and you begin to make our way down."
"1451110","1454910"," You set up the trade, you slam the sell button and you're off and running."
"1456050","1456530"," Otherwise. "
"1457270","1458410"," As has been proving."
"1459050","1463010"," This is just is just another opportunity to buy a dip by a dip by."
"1463130","1467010"," These are with bull bulls going to step in here, step in here and step in here. "
"1467170","1470010"," Now you know where the other upper range of the bull and your bands are."
"1471710","1477070"," So even right here where we are right now, even down here right now, you're going to see bear our"
"1477070","1479550"," bulls wanting to buy this dip."
"1480190","1484050"," By this dip and even underneath it by the dip. "
"1485550","1488030"," Right and can keep the room."
"1488590","1491750"," For us to melt up into the end of the week."
"1495760","1498960"," These these F and bulls and you can see it back here. "
"1500700","1503620"," These F and bulls stepped in down here."
"1503620","1504500"," These these bulls."
"1505340","1507360"," Like me step in. "
"1508100","1511440"," By by and they want to buy again down here."
"1511640","1511800"," Right."
"1512160","1517120"," And they're going to want to grind this up and grind this up and grind this up as time goes"
"1517120","1517440"," on. "
"1519260","1522740"," So it doesn't mean you can't take the short or hold some I got some puts for this."
"1522740","1526420"," So we can get down here today and I can close these bad boys out."
"1526500","1529040"," I really want four oh six if I can get it. "
"1529360","1531360"," But you know it's what it is."
"1531360","1531660"," Right."
"1532060","1536320"," If you're a bear and you really want to put on a trade with like no risk. "
"1536320","1539000"," Well I guess there was a trade with no risk above here."
"1539400","1541200"," A short trade as soon as we tagged it."
"1541300","1543840"," But this trade is pretty much almost done. "
"1544440","1550920"," The real trade for bears is break below and confirm the rejection and start heading lower."
"1551080","1553920"," This is the juice through the money trade is for a bear down here."
"1555820","1558240"," You guys think I hate fucking bears and I don't. "
"1559120","1560900"," Just a better bear than most bears."
"1564740","1567780"," Trade nice and low right now trading for 10 10."
"1568340","1573420"," So you can bombs are raised from the 10 years steady at three spot four percent versus three spot"
"1573420","1574040"," five three. "
"1574160","1575740"," Now with this move down right."
"1576280","1578560"," Is this like game over for the bulls?"
"1578980","1580100"," Probably not."
"1580500","1583480"," Probably not over for the bulls at this point. "
"1585400","1589060"," We need some relief so that we can grind higher."
"1589060","1594900"," So if you're at that bones or band trader if you want that relief to grind higher into end of"
"1594900","1595060"," week."
"1595580","1598040"," Your dip by is right here at the sourly trigger. "
"1598640","1601040"," If you're a bull and you're like I can't buy any of this."
"1601080","1603820"," I can't trade this melt up and I want a better buy in."
"1604100","1605880"," I'm going to show you where that number is. "
"1607140","1608040"," It's moved up."
"1608180","1610300"," It's now three ninety nine eighty one."
"1611340","1614580"," Oh man if I can get this fucking trade on I'd be so stoked. "
"1615280","1617060"," I'll show you how low that one is."
"1617720","1619680"," I said three eighty nine I meant three ninety eight."
"1621600","1622320"," Hold on. "
"1622340","1626760"," The Wall Street Journal Chinese regulators recently have three ninety nine hundred reviews of"
"1626760","1628220"," ninety eight ninety one."
"1629460","1630860"," Way down here."
"1632980","1634420"," Way down here. "
"1635060","1636660"," Let me snap a line for this one."
"1638300","1640080"," This is where the juicy trade is."
"1640200","1641300"," This is where the bears want right here. "
"1641380","1642200"," See this one down here."
"1643140","1645620"," This is the one that a bear wants."
"1645620","1646340"," Look at this one. "
"1648080","1649980"," The bears are they can smell it."
"1650080","1651720"," They're like they're like white bowls."
"1652060","1654420"," Just let it let this let it sell down. "
"1656460","1658520"," This is where the bears want it right there."
"1659380","1661560"," But not only do the bears want it down there."
"1662520","1665020"," They want we make this fat okay. "
"1665640","1669360"," It's really fat for the bears because you know they're probably at home right now."
"1670220","1672080"," Fucking going nuts right now."
"1672080","1676200"," He gives a speech at the international center for monetary and banking. "
"1676340","1676780"," He too."
"1677880","1678920"," Right down there."
"1679080","1679680"," Believe it or not. "
"1680140","1681780"," Way down there."
"1682240","1684480"," And this is where the juice of the trade is."
"1684580","1686340"," This is where the you get underneath. "
"1686740","1688900"," You confirm the trade and you start blasting."
"1689240","1692520"," No care if it takes day two days three days or whatever."
"1692700","1694060"," This is what a bear wants right here. "
"1694340","1696160"," And not only do they want this right here."
"1696540","1698440"," They want to close all this gap bullshit."
"1698440","1700400"," They want to close all this gap bullshit. "
"1701200","1704380"," And they're going to tell you a story that doom of doom and gloom right."
"1704940","1707440"," They're going to tell you that markets going to crash."
"1707860","1708900"," I was thinking about this yesterday. "
"1709080","1711600"," I was like looking into this piece by the Wall Street Journal."
"1711980","1715860"," Says the US encourage China to set up a robust anti-trust regime."
"1716420","1718580"," Now Beijing is looking is holding back. "
"1718880","1721760"," It's required green light for mergers that involve them."
"1721840","1723900"," That's where old man Jim wants to buy way down there."
"1724120","1726640"," This is where the this is where like the cheap shit is down here. "
"1730640","1732800"," This is where your this is where a bowl is safer."
"1733000","1734380"," There's more breathing room."
"1734620","1736580"," So you're not grinding up into Friday. "
"1737620","1740320"," This is where you get this where you get some breathing room is a bull."
"1740480","1741920"," Where you can buy a dip and go on."
"1742340","1743880"," I was thinking yesterday I was like. "
"1744440","1746800"," I was like I was like I was like these fucking bears."
"1746800","1748680"," I was almost posted yesterday and fed into it."
"1748680","1749220"," I was going to post. "
"1749660","1751620"," We need to crash a hundred point crash."
"1751680","1752360"," The 400."
"1757220","1761380"," I was like we need a hundred point crash to 400. "
"1762400","1764100"," I don't know if you find that funny but I do."
"1765640","1771120"," I think bears right now would just take the hundred point crash is calling a day and be like I'm"
"1771120","1771340"," stoked."
"1772900","1776400"," I always like how price changes and we're talking about crashes around here. "
"1778800","1780700"," 400 is the new target for a crash."
"1781680","1783200"," I bet a bear would take it."
"1783560","1785400"," I bet a bear would be like I'm fucking stoked. "
"1785640","1786760"," I got my hundred fucking points."
"1788000","1791900"," I also bet that down there bears going to be like we're going another 400 from here."
"1792020","1793120"," But you know whatever. "
"1794260","1797060"," Take what you can get I guess bull or bear."
"1799590","1801030"," So here's your pivot right now."
"1801090","1801830"," We're coming into the pivot. "
"1801830","1804870"," This is your intraday positive and negative gamma."
"1805650","1807790"," We start selling rips and all that kind of stuff."
"1807950","1812790"," We're in the five minute chart right now we're having you can see this nice bat bear flag is"
"1812790","1813410"," forming up. "
"1813930","1817130"," If you look on the bear flag right here it is where it started right down here."
"1817810","1819170"," This is the one minute chart right now."
"1821450","1825890"," So you want to see bears hold on to this right if we trade up here and start teeing off. "
"1826610","1831010"," The stronger the move down is the more we don't even go above that white line to check."
"1831190","1833610"," We just start teeing off this yellow line right here."
"1834330","1836330"," You know the bears are in control of the market. "
"1840870","1843870"," Like a hundred point crash the fourth fucking hundred on real."
"1846050","1849190"," Not three forty five going down to twenty eight hundred is it."
"1852750","1854150"," I'm sorry I'm giggling. "
"1860070","1860870"," All right."
"1862730","1865490"," Hopefully turn around Tuesday who we can go lower this morning."
"1867250","1868730"," I do I'll be honest with you with that. "
"1869390","1870330"," I'll be honest with you."
"1870590","1872110"," You don't want to trade that easy."
"1872390","1876930"," You don't want to be trading like the bulge of the green bars all the way up into Friday. "
"1876930","1878170"," You can we can."
"1878790","1881030"," But you don't want to you want to you want to breathe there."
"1881210","1884530"," You just want to chill with them are chill the fuck out for like five minutes. "
"1895060","1896180"," We need some water."
"1896840","1898200"," My voice is wrecked."
"1901180","1902520"," It's almost like I'm a smoker. "
"1902780","1903320"," I don't even smoke."
"1904700","1909320"," So surely expecting the release for Bank of England's pills speech and slides."
"1911220","1915100"," You can see the initial buying this is if you remember the green line that I was showing you. "
"1915120","1917720"," This is going to be the first buy right here right where we are."
"1919120","1921660"," You can see it down below down there."
"1921660","1923260"," You can see the buyers stepping in. "
"1923660","1925180"," We'll draw a little yellow box in there."
"1925500","1926640"," We know they're going to be here."
"1926640","1930800"," This is where they show up every single time. "
"1931260","1935640"," I showed you that that this is the lowest that they show up where that green line is."
"1936080","1937240"," For the highest I should say."
"1937820","1939220"," And then this is the green line. "
"1939380","1943460"," We haven't come close to touching this in fucking a week."
"1944660","1945300"," A week."
"1946900","1950380"," Five trades that's something that five train sessions or something like that. "
"1950900","1951680"," We haven't touched this thing."
"1951740","1952020"," It's five."
"1952180","1952780"," Let me see him if you look. "
"1955220","1955700"," One."
"1956580","1957060"," Two."
"1958760","1959020"," Five. "
"1959500","1960060"," I haven't touched it."
"1960980","1961460"," Five."
"1961700","1963280"," You can count them right there. "
"1965840","1967420"," And depending on how you're calling it."
"1967760","1968140"," Six."
"1968500","1968560"," One. "
"1968800","1968900"," Two."
"1969300","1969860"," That's really five."
"1969960","1970220"," It's one. "
"1970800","1970840"," Two."
"1971980","1972140"," Four."
"1972380","1972800"," And five. "
"1973460","1974620"," Have not touched that green line."
"1974740","1980140"," It's just March all the way up on a pretty pretty significant run for bulls."
"1983690","1984670"," Pretty significant. "
"1984890","1987870"," And you see the sellers naturally step in right here."
"1988290","1989790"," This is the first real chance."
"1990590","1995030"," That bears have had to sell this market and they're going to take that shot at it. "
"1995350","1997510"," And try to get through this green line today."
"1998190","1998690"," Guaranteed."
"1999290","2001030"," The hedge is definitely on. "
"2001750","2002750"," We're going to show you some."
"2002890","2003870"," I'm going to show you something else."
"2006050","2009360"," For the bulls at least. "
"2009360","2011380"," I'm going to show you some SPX."
"2011660","2014460"," The bank of England's pill on the new state for those of you that are interested."
"2017600","2021440"," The bank of England's pills is the MPC's communication about the algorithm. "
"2021760","2025360"," There's that there's that green by the ZSPX is that same green box."
"2025920","2027060"," That I drew for you."
"2027120","2028300"," It'd be really nice here. "
"2028380","2029420"," See that line up here."
"2032340","2039000"," It'd be really nice as a bear or as a bull to trade off this right and try to stay"
"2039000","2039920"," on trend."
"2042400","2042860"," Right. "
"2043080","2043640"," Make our way."
"2043840","2049620"," Get the support that we need to get up here and get above where these natural sellers are."
"2050239","2050960"," This here. "
"2051120","2052000"," This for 13."
"2053060","2053520"," Right."
"2053699","2055880"," If the support stays in the market to go higher. "
"2056120","2056320"," Wherever."
"2056360","2057040"," However, that happens."
"2057320","2059040"," So we have this over here. "
"2059300","2064940"," Immediate outlook will be bank rate decisions as there is a lot of policy in the pipeline still to"
"2064940","2065460"," come through."
"2070380","2076040"," A pill says in caution is still needed in assessing inflation prospects on account of the potential"
"2076040","2078699"," persistence of domestically generated inflation."
"2080040","2081739"," See this red line right here. "
"2084219","2086280"," And there's that green box over here."
"2086920","2088380"," The screen box has been following."
"2088840","2089460"," Not this one. "
"2090159","2091760"," But there's a green box is the hourly trigger."
"2092239","2093340"," You want this to come up."
"2093960","2095080"," You want this to move up. "
"2098480","2098960"," Right."
"2099200","2099440"," Move up."
"2099440","2101500"," March up with this red line right here. "
"2101580","2104660"," And provide the support that's needed in price."
"2105360","2105860"," Financial conditions."
"2107460","2109460"," So now the green box is up here. "
"2110060","2111580"," The red line is up here."
"2111820","2116720"," The white lines up here to give the push that's needed to get past the sell side."
"2117160","2120400"," And start attacking the gap that's up there. "
"2120500","2121440"," You can't see it on the start."
"2121600","2122700"," But there's a gap up here at 420."
"2123520","2124980"," If you want to attack the 420. "
"2125820","2127480"," You need velocity behind you."
"2127480","2133860"," And you need consolidation in velocity to get up there and attack that 420 that you're looking for."
"2134500","2134940"," Above. "
"2135320","2136580"," So right where we are right now."
"2136760","2137600"," Can we grind higher?"
"2137920","2138020"," Yes."
"2138340","2139000"," Can we grind higher today?"
"2139240","2139380"," Yes. "
"2139820","2140960"," Can the dip be bought today?"
"2141160","2141220"," Yes."
"2141260","2142800"," Can we do this nonsense today?"
"2143100","2148440"," Until we squeeze up with the green bar coming up behind us the red bar and just grind to that"
"2148440","2148620"," 420?"
"2148980","2149120"," Yes."
"2149380","2154420"," But the truth is, as a bull, you want to see the consolidation. "
"2154420","2161060"," The consolidation is calmed down moments and kind of consolidates and get the demand and the smart"
"2161060","2166280"," buyers to help you get up there and slam into that, closing that gap above."
"2167340","2170560"," I'm still a believer in this gap, closing this gap above."
"2171060","2174200"," As long as I don't fade below this, it's on. "
"2174560","2177660"," I mean, overall context, well, not overall."
"2178380","2182280"," Not like two years from now through five years from now in this run right now."
"2183200","2184160"," I'm bullish here. "
"2184360","2189180"," I'm bullish to close the gap on high and then almost a minute show to you in a daily."
"2194900","2196180"," It's just an update on the victim."
"2196460","2196880"," All right there. "
"2196980","2197740"," You can see it."
"2197740","2202060"," I'm bullish to close this gap up here at 420, 420."
"2203280","2207040"," I'm bullish over time to come up here and attack the 4350. "
"2207500","2208280"," I'm actually bullish."
"2208500","2212180"," Believe it or not, as long as this is as long as some kind of structure is maintained in here,"
"2212760","2214320"," we can close for 6480."
"2214540","2215180"," All kinds of shit. "
"2215180","2220620"," We can go way, way higher if we like one plus one equals two, right?"
"2220720","2222700"," All the way up in the cases of inflation."
"2224920","2226100"," Now we can grind this up."
"2226200","2227760"," We can grind this bad boy up for a month and a half. "
"2227780","2228820"," We can go right into May with this."
"2236090","2241600"," Now with that said, cool your jets."
"2242620","2246480"," Look for a dip to buy down here is the bull stops underneath. "
"2247720","2250300"," And you know that we're trying to grind higher."
"2250880","2253960"," You know that we're going to try to grind higher to that for 13 17."
"2254440","2259880"," You know we're going to try to not for 13 17 to squeeze up into this for 15 into Friday"
"2259880","2261560"," for for 1499. "
"2262200","2264280"," I'll try to squeeze up there and just tag it."
"2265140","2266920"," Tag it and bag it."
"2267120","2270000"," We've got three more days left today, tomorrow and Thursday. "
"2270120","2273800"," The U.S. states have lost down 0.5% at one on one."
"2274080","2275980"," So I guess maybe you want to know when I'm going to buy it."
"2277440","2278840"," Probably not right here. "
"2279040","2279840"," I'd like to buy it."
"2279860","2282060"," I'd like to buy it down here if I could this 409."
"2282840","2284840"," I'd like to buy it with conviction down. "
"2285140","2285980"," Believe it or not at 400."
"2286780","2294200"," And with all that said, even on Twitter this morning, I said price rules, right?"
"2294340","2295080"," Price action rules."
"2295980","2297540"," So let's say we see. "
"2298980","2299660"," Hold on here."
"2304160","2306780"," Let's say we see price move."
"2306980","2307980"," Let's see see this right here. "
"2308140","2308780"," Let's say today."
"2319020","2321700"," We see this happen today and we see price."
"2326700","2328340"," Make its way higher here. "
"2329040","2329840"," Push up."
"2330980","2332620"," Confirm the move to go higher."
"2333120","2334940"," I'll take that fucking trade every day. "
"2335780","2340400"," And I don't care about the Bollinger bands and I don't care about what says you can't be there and"
"2340400","2341200"," all that kind of stuff."
"2341480","2343040"," To me, price action rules."
"2343340","2347300"," So if this price action shows us that we're heading higher, I'm all over it. "
"2347300","2349980"," But I'm still this proves itself today."
"2350620","2352340"," I'm still in put there."
"2352460","2358060"," I have my protection on for this downward move, trying to tag down below at least 409. "
"2360220","2361240"," I think it's four."
"2361500","2362340"," I think it's four."
"2362580","2363560"," Let me make sure I get this right. "
"2367240","2368980"," 408.98 down here."
"2369320","2370920"," And I'd really like to go even lower."
"2377280","2380460"," Bank of England's post is relative to where we were a few months ago. "
"2380700","2383440"," The difficult trade off the facing monetary policy has ease."
"2383960","2385400"," Hopefully this makes you feel better."
"2385520","2388840"," I'm hoping if you're watching this program, this makes you feel like not just feel, but like in"
"2388840","2391500"," your brain, say, yeah, this is where we are so we could go. "
"2392120","2394040"," And this is where the downside is."
"2394640","2398040"," See an awareness of where we are in the market, where we should be going."
"2398660","2399620"," That kind of stuff. "
"2399800","2402760"," So if this then that and all that kind of stuff, hoping that helps you out."
"2403420","2407940"," When you're, I know that yesterday in Fintuit, it kind of felt bad yesterday."
"2407940","2412300"," There was, I don't know who it was, but someone posted and said, I really don't know. "
"2412720","2413660"," I don't know how to trade this."
"2413860","2421220"," They were like, they're like, I don't, I don't understand the mechanics of how you trade this."
"2422740","2427480"," And I kind of fell back because I was like, I've been there where you just get to this point"
"2427480","2429420"," where you don't know you can't really. "
"2431920","2439140"," Safe or certain like that feeling of when you're like creating an arrange, it's easy for people to"
"2439140","2440100"," be like, this is support."
"2440300","2441140"," This is resistance."
"2442140","2445880"," This is my expectation is if we bounce off this, we go to this next number above. "
"2446300","2450400"," And then we're trading up here, it gets kind of foggy for people."
"2451280","2453660"," And they don't know what to do if we go above it either, right?"
"2453760","2456400"," If we grind up for the next, if we grind up for the next four or five days."
"2457040","2462780"," It's hard for people to capture where that trade can go. "
"2464520","2465720"," Expectations of that trade."
"2470600","2471860"," That was kind of an honest thing."
"2472020","2475240"," It kind of like, I was like, I've been there and understand that feeling. "
"2477200","2480500"," It's one of those things too, as a streamer, right?"
"2480820","2481900"," It was a streamer with you guys."
"2482920","2488440"," You have to show up every day and at least know if this then that where it could go."
"2488440","2490440"," What's the potential of where we can go?"
"2492440","2494560"," Especially when it's unknown, when you're trading. "
"2495420","2499760"," You'll see people out there be like, do a, you'll see people out there be like, oh, just measure"
"2499760","2500420"," the move higher."
"2500960","2501960"," And there's your upper levels."
"2502240","2503380"," I'm like, yeah, that's easy. "
"2503740","2507660"," But people feel like they're not on some, some kind of us."
"2508200","2509900"," People want structure with that too, right?"
"2510080","2512320"," They want like, they want it."
"2512560","2514700"," I don't know how to explain it. "
"2515420","2516820"," It's a weird feeling."
"2518080","2519240"," But I know I've been there."
"2519320","2522320"," I could feel that when that guy said that last night, I was like, man, I've been there. "
"2522520","2523660"," And I know that feeling."
"2536800","2537500"," It's over."
"2540620","2541500"," Always like that. "
"2541640","2541940"," It's over."
"2544520","2548590"," I don't think anything's over here."
"2548950","2549750"," Not right now. "
"2549910","2552010"," There's been nothing to prove that anything's over here."
"2554190","2555310"," But I get your feeling."
"2562830","2568510"," Anyone that says it's over is probably likely not guaranteed has never traded a melt up market. "
"2568870","2572790"," And we've seen what happens in those melt up markets, right?"
"2573010","2573970"," Those melt up markets."
"2575370","2577030"," They're people don't trade them."
"2577190","2579650"," People just stay in the sidelines when they give all their money back. "
"2580870","2582950"," They just short, short, short, short, short, short."
"2583170","2584150"," They get run over."
"2587540","2596400"," If you've traded, if you, if you traded in or before, I guess, 2020 or the bottom of 2020. "
"2598040","2600700"," I guess you would have need to have been the market at this point."
"2600860","2601200"," What year is it?"
"2601400","2602640"," 20, 3, 4 years now?"
"2602720","2603960"," Have you been in the market almost four years?"
"2606540","2607240"," Jesus, man."
"2607680","2608160"," Fucking old. "
"2609420","2613080"," I keep saying a decade and it's been longer than a decade now."
"2613740","2615760"," It's like the reference points are changing."
"2616660","2619320"," Those COVID years, man, they fucking those COVID years. "
"2619780","2621040"," It's like they don't even exist."
"2621740","2622880"," They're not even real."
"2625100","2632180"," It's like just a blank space coming back down to retest right now. "
"2632660","2633800"," That same little yellow box."
"2639840","2641340"," Same yellow box right now."
"2641720","2643720"," Yeah, I've got some, I've got some June. "
"2643720","2646460"," I've got some calls for June for IWM."
"2648120","2649520"," Not even phased by those."
"2649900","2652320"," I'm just going to let them sit there and sit there and sit there. "
"2654560","2657680"," Those are the ones that you bury in a box somewhere and you don't like the bears."
"2657940","2659500"," You just put them in a box and don't look at them."
"2659580","2664280"," You just bury yourself in the closet, bury yourself in the basement, bury yourself in a hole in the"
"2664280","2664560"," backyard. "
"2665220","2666000"," Don't even look at them."
"2667060","2668800"," Because the move is still up here."
"2669120","2670020"," The move is not down. "
"2671360","2672580"," I don't know if you know this."
"2672700","2677740"," The move is up from the green line and from four fucking hundred."
"2678140","2679700"," The move is up. "
"2682040","2687260"," Which is insane that we could get down to 400 right now and we're still in full trend."
"2688220","2689180"," Which is insane."
"2696090","2701830"," Oh yeah, I saw that headline this morning, Nino with Marco saying that shit this morning. "
"2702410","2709250"," Someone said, someone in Fintuit said this morning like Jamie, Jamie Diamond is right."
"2709510","2710270"," Marco is right."
"2710510","2711650"," People are going to lose so much money. "
"2711730","2716490"," I'm like, we've made so much fucking money off of that off of Marco and Jamie this year."
"2716710","2719190"," We made Marty starting back in September and October."
"2724730","2728810"," Diamond was like we're going down and then Diamond switched his comments to no, no, we're going up"
"2728810","2729950"," possibly into December. "
"2732950","2734190"," They fucking changed."
"2734510","2735790"," They changed their shit so much."
"2735790","2736630"," It's not even funny. "
"2741210","2743250"," And they don't trade well typically up on."
"2743410","2745050"," They don't trade well typically up into."
"2747470","2750390"," In these meltups like banks or prime banks. "
"2750970","2755670"," Prime banks are typically the volume that someone else yesterday was saying something about no"
"2755670","2756510"," volume in this market."
"2758350","2759630"," Why are we moving higher?"
"2760050","2761030"," A couple rules here."
"2761030","2765750"," Low volume, we get most of our big moves to the upside on low volume. "
"2766990","2768170"," And that's like a rule."
"2769710","2771610"," Biggest moves low volume."
"2772490","2778310"," Next biggest rule size does not come into the market until the move is already made. "
"2778550","2782030"," If you look to when the banks got 2020 is a great example."
"2782750","2785990"," Banks did not buy this market until the end of 2020."
"2786650","2787590"," They didn't buy it. "
"2787730","2788690"," They didn't want anything to do with it."
"2789510","2792790"," And they didn't enter the market until the end of 2020."
"2792790","2798050"," Like we're talking like August or September or something is when size actually entered the market. "
"2798310","2799970"," So they're big."
"2800350","2804570"," They can't do what a hedge fund can do what a retail trader can do."
"2805410","2807070"," Speculative traders and that kind of stuff. "
"2809150","2815430"," Starting to staircase down now trading 486 beautiful sell off of the white line."
"2815630","2817350"," Beautiful sell off the white and red line above."
"2818270","2822750"," Hopefully take care of your calls earlier and you can look for a dip to buy down here at 409. "
"2823310","2829030"," Or even lower believe it or not if we can have that nice nice red day and get down here."
"2829670","2836390"," Slam into our expected range right now is 407.23. I want to see a least 406 today if possible."
"2836990","2839750"," And if we can actually buy 400 I'd be even happier. "
"2859690","2861670"," Unless that hey Winky I just missed brother."

"2985300","2988800"," We could literally trade all the way down here and still be in bullish trend. "
"2989320","2990940"," That's how high we've come."
"2991900","2994140"," That's the work that's been done at this point."
"2995060","2997900"," And still be in bullish trend to higher highs. "
"2999120","3001300"," This isn't even a lower low down here."
"3001300","3003200"," This is literally not a lower low."
"3004520","3009720"," This is this bull trend is way fucking lower or even lower. "
"3009720","3010440"," It's right down here."
"3011280","3013480"," I mean the bull trend is down here."
"3014440","3016820"," That's how that's how crazy price has been. "

"3026740","3027480"," God it's right. "
"3027680","3029140"," It's actually longer."
"3029400","3030560"," More sessions than that."
"3030780","3031420"," China, Japan. "
"3032060","3032240"," History."
"3032480","3032720"," Corporation."

"3055690","3056730"," April 4th."
"3058530","3060350"," So it kind of makes sense right?"
"3060630","3064130"," Three week cycle bull three week cycle bear one week cycle."
"3065530","3066970"," Kind of firm it up. "
"3067270","3069310"," Kind of smelling like a bull market right?"
"3070050","3071890"," Kind of smelling like not bull market."
"3072010","3073670"," Let's call it instead of calling it a bull market."
"3075290","3078390"," Like I think Tom Leer did some bullshit. "
"3078530","3079650"," I reposted what he said."
"3079830","3081490"," He said it's a new bull market."
"3082070","3083670"," I wouldn't call it a bull market. "
"3083830","3087270"," I'd call it a normalization of markets."
"3089270","3090870"," A normalization of markets."
"3091150","3093890"," I'd call it like where you have a cycle. "
"3094430","3095190"," Three weeks up."
"3095970","3096710"," One week pullback."
"3096950","3097450"," Three weeks up. "
"3097850","3098570"," One week pullback."
"3098870","3100150"," That's what it's been doing."
"3100590","3101210"," Not looking like. "
"3101370","3102230"," It's been doing."
"3102830","3103430"," Three weeks up."
"3104030","3104550"," We can pull back. "
"3105310","3105350"," Right?"
"3106030","3107990"," Sometimes that we can pull back is deeper than usual."
"3108490","3109830"," Sometimes it's regular right?"
"3110550","3112210"," Like clockwork every month."
"3112530","3113490"," That's what it's looking like at least. "
"3114890","3116150"," I shouldn't say looking like."
"3116270","3117370"," That's what it is fucking doing."
"3123410","3124310"," Yeah, it's hard. "
"3125490","3126790"," They shouldn't say that."
"3126950","3131550"," They should just say normalization of markets is a much better explanation."
"3132810","3134970"," It's more of a normalization of market. "
"3139570","3141830"," That's what a normal market looks like."
"3141830","3146650"," Is you have these normal monthly cycles, normal quarterly cycles."
"3148250","3152830"," And we're not talking about like price like going to all time fucking highs and a straight meld"
"3152830","3155490"," number just talking about normal market cycles. "
"3157710","3158850"," Which we haven't had."
"3158990","3162310"," We didn't have that in the first half of 2022, did we?"
"3162490","3163730"," We didn't have normal market cycles."
"3164250","3167970"," In fact, we didn't have normal market cycles into October. "
"3168310","3169330"," We didn't have them."
"3169330","3177360"," And so it's just there's a normalization to markets right now."
"3177400","3178300"," At least I've noticed. "
"3184610","3185950"," You guys are saying out there."
"3207270","3209490"," Yeah, one 80 is the must hold for."
"3210330","3212350"," Let's go look at you guys want to look at Tesla. "
"3213230","3214070"," We'll look at Tesla real quick."
"3214770","3215750"," Thanks playing the."
"3217730","3219010"," The idea behind Tesla. "
"3231450","3232770"," Or be more clear with Tesla."
"3233610","3236050"," So Tesla's doing quite well right now."
"3236890","3238330"," Better than it should be doing. "
"3239190","3241430"," If you look at Tesla like you look at IWM."
"3244450","3246430"," This is way down here right."
"3247270","3248150"," It's one 63. "
"3250050","3256410"," And you can see this is a lot and this is like hard grinding hard work for Tesla."
"3257090","3260410"," Think of Tesla as being like in this phase of."
"3261710","3267690"," Smash sell off smash sell off sellers stepping in telling you fuck no big squeeze up. "
"3268130","3268690"," Right."
"3269250","3273570"," Smash down smash down these are all sellers here smash it down smash down."
"3273630","3276270"," This is all south side telling you hey I'm short. "

"3278050","3279050"," This is my favorite short."
"3279390","3280510"," I love being short Tesla. "
"3281050","3281850"," I'm a bear."
"3282070","3282690"," I'm Tesla Q."

"3291050","3294550"," This is emotionally anger trading squeezes up higher. "
"3295010","3295490"," Right."
"3295670","3299810"," Short cut off guard slam it down as hard as they possibly can and rage sell."
"3300410","3302350"," Tesla right rage rage rage rage rage. "
"3304650","3305170"," Rage."
"3305330","3305870"," This is literal."
"3306310","3308410"," There's a there's a professional somewhere out there. "
"3308850","3310210"," I assure you that's like."
"3310970","3313610"," That's like this is my fucking ticker."
"3313830","3318010"," This is my meme stock that I get to sell and you don't have a choice. "
"3318010","3323080"," This is like this a lot of years for Tesla."
"3325640","3328920"," So just down in here taking a look at Tesla right in here."
"3336110","3341410"," You can see the demand side right pushed all the way up pushed all the way up right. "
"3342230","3348630"," It's pushed right same thing bought here bought here and you don't want to be giving this up."
"3348790","3352230"," You can trade down here but you need to see the demand come in."
"3352490","3353710"," There's that 180 right there. "
"3354910","3356710"," You need to see the demand come in."
"3356710","3358990"," If you see the demand leave Tesla."
"3359690","3362410"," If you see like this is all wiped out the demand is gone. "
"3363230","3364290"," We trade down here."
"3364390","3367290"," Let's say in Tesla and nobody shows up to buy it."
"3367350","3368370"," You know what that means right. "
"3369230","3370350"," We're fucking going down."
"3371330","3372730"," Until you find some demand."
"3373570","3375170"," We know the last place for demand. "
"3376350","3377530"," On Tesla's 165."
"3380710","3383070"," To be a good precursor to find out if."
"3384550","3387870"," There's demand in the market any longer or if we're going to find some lower lows. "
"3391360","3392140"," And in truth."
"3395280","3396000"," Well out here."
"3401160","3402800"," That's not the best one to be looking at here. "
"3404500","3406460"," In truth we'll look at it on this one."
"3407780","3408520"," This is SPX."
"3409540","3412380"," I don't know why the fuck now this is showing up on my charts. "
"3413560","3415380"," In truth this is SPX up here okay."
"3428380","3430440"," In truth I'd really like to see."
"3440540","3442040"," Until it's invalidated. "
"3443920","3447180"," I'd really like to see is that really like to see this push up higher."
"3447980","3449980"," Just push up higher believe it or not."
"3450700","3452840"," This four sixty four eighty. "
"3455440","3456960"," And somewhere in here."
"3459880","3461920"," Revisit thirty two hundred."
"3464220","3466500"," Revisit twenty twenty eight hundred. "
"3467520","3469720"," I see this playing out."
"3470060","3475060"," I don't I don't think I mind even a debt sale in bullshit in June."
"3476060","3478660"," You usually have a bloodbath in June July. "
"3479560","3481140"," Maybe I should redraw that."
"3482120","3483760"," You know something like this."
"3484760","3490400"," You get that you get that July or June bloodbath and then we continue higher believe it or not into"
"3490400","3491100"," the fall. "
"3492200","3498180"," And then you get that fall winter bloodbath whether it's in September October January March"
"3498180","3500380"," something like that we get back down to thirty two hundred."
"3501200","3503040"," Right now market is telling you up."
"3504820","3506780"," In the long term that's what's telling you. "
"3508380","3510740"," And this needs to be disproven at some point."
"3510960","3512980"," I think this is where the big bear trap is."
"3513760","3515680"," I think that there's a moment this summer. "
"3516440","3520920"," I think there's a big bear trap in June or July at some point."
"3521060","3522280"," There's going to be something with Ukraine."
"3522600","3526940"," There's going to be something with the debt ceiling and people are going to get beard the fuck up. "
"3528020","3531700"," The truth is we're going to clear out every single truth is likely we're going to clear out every"
"3531700","3532000"," short."
"3532740","3537380"," And then come back down to revisit three thousand thirty two hundred twenty hundred something like"
"3537380","3537580"," that."
"3537580","3546280"," At least that's what it's trading like right now. "
"3547560","3549780"," At least what's going on right now."
"3550380","3552960"," You'd need some you need to be invalidated at some point."
"3553100","3558220"," I think the I think the biggest in validation for bears want to see is something unknown to the"
"3558220","3558500"," market. "
"3560480","3561800"," Something unknown to the market."
"3562080","3563680"," Something unknown to the market something."
"3563820","3564340"," Material. "
"3564980","3566780"," We talked about a mass casual event."
"3566780","3569340"," The someone's once the summer fence of his own Ukraine."
"3570820","3574840"," I think you got a I think you got that issue and then you've got the debt ceiling. "
"3575860","3578560"," If it becomes fruitful at any point."
"3579440","3581680"," I would be the next one other than that."
"3582460","3584700"," The way that said share power. "
"3586400","3590380"," His people still to this point don't talk about."
"3592540","3593800"," To me he."
"3595480","3597240"," A materially changed. "
"3598840","3603580"," The idea that an empty is not dead and that they're going to support all the way through."
"3605560","3608120"," And you're going to deal with inflation longer than you expected."
"3609580","3612420"," You're going to do with money sloshing around longer than you expected. "
"3614180","3617020"," You need something materially different from."
"3619780","3621100"," From him at this point."
"3624900","3626600"," The fraud goes on in the. "
"3627420","3630940"," Well I think he's trying to say to you well the fraud is not going to go on we're just"
"3630940","3631180"," going to."
"3632300","3634780"," We're just going to be supportive as the fraud continues."
"3642620","3648460"," Yeah I think that so so far right now so far right now the problem here is that they've said"
"3648460","3649380"," that they will support. "
"3650660","3655280"," Institutions and you'll see like you'll see commercial properties have a crisis at some point."
"3655860","3660540"," You we already know we're going to see things break down the road but the fact that they're"
"3660540","3661640"," supportive of these things breaking."
"3662260","3665780"," Is a problem it's a it's a fly in the ointment for everybody. "
"3666960","3671520"," I don't I don't know any fucking bulls man that want to run this up to 480 or 460."
"3672620","3677080"," I don't know any bulls bulls want fucking lows man bulls want a fucking dip."

"3682660","3688440"," I want to buy a stock and not have to care about it for five years 10 years."

"3706630","3710810"," I know and I don't care if we go down for a month or two months or three months."
"3710810","3718840"," I want a fucking bull market and I'm not going to get a bull market that's safe unless we have"
"3718840","3719520"," that last capitulation. "
"3721640","3724300"," We all know that I think everybody knows that."
"3725180","3727500"," Nice moves here for the bears."
"3728040","3730420"," They have a nice cell point here. "
"3730520","3735300"," We're going to turn this yellow here or eventually we're going to turn this yellow into a red if we"
"3735300","3735540"," can."

"4067040","4067480"," If you're a bull. "
"4070100","4070740"," See here."
"4071260","4076000"," You're going to get out the track here."
"4078340","4080360"," You're going to get out the old eight track and blow it up. "

"4126950","4129569"," Bears looking for a break below. "
"4131689","4132210"," 4088."
"4132689","4133630"," Can they get it done?"
"4135290","4139450"," We're going to find out here in a short few moments, I believe."
"4140930","4146569"," Look above at 409.89. We have one other spot above that. "
"4146790","4147770"," Take a look at it."

"4149430","4159270"," Oh, 410.79. Keep your eyes on 410.79. 409.89. Bears want to dip"

"4217230","4218970"," Can the bears do it?"
"4218970","4228810"," I'm feeling"
"4228810","4230370"," kind of hairy right now."
"4237010","4239490"," Can the bears get down?"
"4254310","4256010"," Hold on, we got to turn that off. "
"4260650","4261590"," I don't know what this is."
"4261770","4262870"," Some other weird bear music."
"4275220","4276660"," Oh, look at that, huh?"
"4277820","4279540"," Look where we're sitting right now. "
"4279700","4280020"," Look at that."
"4280240","4285240"," Oh, whoa."
"4290970","4292430"," Did you feel it?"
"4294730","4296070"," Hold on here. "
"4296250","4297270"," Print me some money here."
"4300180","4301200"," Come on, baby."
"4304390","4304830"," Whoa. "
"4306330","4306790"," Whoa."
"4312240","4312660"," Whoa."
"4314320","4315220"," Whoa. "
"4315500","4316340"," 4907."
"4317060","4317960"," Whoa."
"4321680","4329560"," 408.96. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
"4338160","4339680"," Whoa, whoa, whoa!"

"4343020","4344540"," Whoa, whoa!"
"4344540","4346740"," 4.89. Whoa."
"4348080","4349700"," Dip your head through there, baby."
"4349980","4350840"," Get down down there. "
"4368660","4373780"," dirty No, no, no, they normally gonna get through here they normally want to stick their head"
"4373780","4374280"," through it."
"4374280","4389910"," They got to stick the head through it Nice,"
"4389950","4391250"," smooth, bears!"
"4392170","4392410"," Congratulations!"
"4393370","4394730"," How's that feel after a week?"
"4395550","4397430"," That felt fucking good, didn't it?"
"4405680","4406980"," That felt good, huh?"
"4407200","4407700"," How'd that feel?"
"4408660","4410480"," There's loosened up a little bit out there."
"4415400","4416840"," Does that feel good?"
"4418560","4419840"," Oh, yeah, baby!"
"4420260","4421720"," Now trading 408.82!"
"4422840","4428240"," Remember, they got to stick their wick through the green bar here. "
"4428900","4431400"," Now what's plan number two for a bear?"
"4432840","4439740"," Plan number two for a bear is they want to get underneath the hourly trigger, right?"
"4439960","4446200"," So they dip their wick down in here, they break past the hourly trigger and now they want to turn"
"4446200","4448740"," the hourly trigger into resistance."
"4451040","4455560"," So they need to get underneath and then they need to turn this into some resistance so we can get"
"4455560","4457000"," down there to 400 next."
"4458700","4459820"," Good job bears!"
"4460720","4461320"," Go bears!"
"4477540","4481420"," Good job bears, way to be brothers and sisters. "
"4495520","4498740"," Hell yeah dude bears dude, you're gonna give bears a minute here man."
"4498900","4499680"," Bears need a minute."
"4500680","4504300"," A lot of bears need to have lost a lot of fucking money in the past week or two. "
"4505660","4507740"," Longer I think and since middle of March."
"4508960","4511440"," Good job bears, way to be."
"4513060","4515120"," Now what does a bear want from here?"
"4515380","4517060"," What does a bear need from here?"
"4518120","4521760"," They need to stay underneath this green line, establish this. "
"4522020","4528020"," Now even if we trade higher right now, what a bear needs to do is get this white line to"
"4528020","4529560"," come underneath, right?"
"4529700","4536460"," And keep this price pressure on here so they can open the door, believe it or not, to 400, 400."
"4538840","4540880"," So this trade is done here."
"4541060","4543880"," In my view, this trade is done. "
"4544220","4545660"," This trade started right here."
"4548600","4549740"," This is where this trade began."
"4550860","4554420"," This trade is a complete trade right here in my view. "
"4554840","4561420"," Now if you want to bearish from this point forward, there's a lot of work that needs done that you"
"4561420","4562580"," don't want to be a part of."
"4562720","4563640"," You want to be a part of this."
"4565340","4566860"," You want to be a part of this move. "
"4567680","4570540"," You don't want to be a part of the bullshit down here."
"4571140","4575620"," You want the confirmation trade that we're going to go lower from here."
"4575740","4576360"," Does that make sense?"
"4577160","4583500"," So if you're a bear, all this noise here means nothing to you. "
"4584220","4590820"," It wouldn't shock me to trip to 41062."
"4592300","4599060"," You need the help of the 1 in 5 minute to get you enough velocity to get below the hourly"
"4599060","4602320"," and then begin to make your next trip down here."
"4603040","4604860"," So there's work to be done for bears. "
"4605540","4607060"," Bears have work to do."
"4616920","4618940"," Congratulations to any of you out there."
"4619200","4623240"," If any of you out there are making money right now, actually I'm making some really good money. "
"4623420","4624220"," I made some money on AMC."
"4625240","4627820"," I made some money on some calls and I just closed out some puts."
"4628140","4629860"," I'm a pretty happy fucking guy right now. "
"4631580","4632680"," So there you go."
"4632940","4633520"," Done, right?"
"4633880","4634500"," Start to finish."
"4635380","4635860"," Congratulations. "
"4661320","4667300"," Now if we want to take a trade here, maybe you're just fucking short."
"4667640","4669500"," I'm assuming that some of y'all are just short."
"4669660","4671280"," You're just like I ain't closing puts ever again. "
"4672780","4674680"," These are the places you need to look here."
"4674820","4677000"," We're going to look at some we're going to look at some places here."
"4677440","4677860"," Hold on here. "
"4677920","4679700"," We're going to put that bullshit there."
"4680440","4680660"," Okay."
"4681740","4687660"," So down here we have now broken below right the hourly trigger right here. "
"4687660","4691540"," I want you to see some more targets down on the downside."
"4691920","4694200"," You got downside target right there."
"4696220","4697260"," 408-44. "
"4698360","4700200"," This is the low from yesterday."
"4701400","4702900"," We're going to get on a five day here."
"4707660","4710660"," Got this nice low right here that needs to be taken out. "
"4710660","4713540"," You've got another one right here not as important."
"4714400","4717600"," Your next big one is going to be really the opening low right here the day before."
"4719240","4720680"," Start to open some doors. "
"4722620","4724420"," You got a nice little gap to fill down here."
"4725580","4727020"," Beautiful sell right there."
"4727060","4727380"," Look at that. "
"4727600","4728660"," Almost to the pin strike."
"4729560","4731400"," Sold it straight down into the hourly trigger."
"4732480","4733840"," We have more down to go. "
"4733900","4735380"," Possibly get down to 408-44."
"4736140","4738440"," We want to break through this 408-44."
"4738700","4739800"," Take out the previous low. "
"4740380","4741140"," You want to get underneath."
"4742360","4742540"," Right."
"4742700","4745660"," Get underneath this lower low of this previous low from yesterday. "
"4746540","4746660"," Right."
"4746820","4751320"," And then turn this into some resistance for a larger move down."
"4751840","4756180"," Now the options market's priced for 406-23, 407-23. "
"4756400","4757780"," It's what I'd like to see for at least today."
"4758080","4759600"," At the end of day we can get this today."
"4759880","4761560"," And then eventually get down to 400 if possible. "
"4771350","4772610"," Oh yeah baby."
"4772910","4773710"," So nice."
"4774710","4775810"," So nice. "
"4776970","4782010"," Right there."
"4783410","4784370"," Right there."
"4787340","4789020"," We'll right in previous low. "
"4815910","4818370"," You can see where S2 is down below there."
"4818730","4821290"," And then S3 is right here."
"4832270","4833330"," Oh yeah man. "
"4833570","4836630"," 408-47-408-49."
"4837250","4837870"," 408-47."
"4838150","4838550"," Come on man. "
"4839330","4840670"," Just a see here more."
"4842050","4844130"," Just a tiny bit more."
"4846190","4852330"," Getting below the hourly trigger trying to establish that this support is now going to become"
"4852330","4852610"," resistance. "
"4853370","4858250"," First time this has happened in the entire bull run that we've had so far."
"4862030","4862670"," Yeah dude."
"4862930","4863550"," Fucking Prince. "
"4863870","4864690"," Fucking Prince."
"4868870","4870990"," 408-44 right now."
"4875660","4878440"," Now broken previous low from yesterday. "
"4879200","4880740"," There's just taking over."
"4880960","4882280"," Trading 408-37."
"4883340","4886300"," Next target below 407-23. "
"4886600","4891540"," This would be the previous day before the previous low from yesterday."
"4905020","4906800"," Who the hell is buying Apple here?"
"4913410","4917510"," Yeah 406p is up right now to 27 cents right now."
"4920140","4921700"," 27 cents right now. "
"4921940","4924240"," Now trading 27 cents right now."
"4925280","4927820"," They were 10 cents at the close yesterday."
"4930840","4932380"," 10 cents at the close yesterday. "
"4950330","4954990"," Nice break below algorithms like this shows that we're going to hit some lower lows down the road."
"4955730","4960510"," Another note here would be when you see a new a previous low being broken."
"4961010","4966720"," A lot of people track this to see if that previous low is broken because the algorithms are telling"
"4966720","4968680"," you that we're going to continue lower over time. "
"4969240","4973040"," Not always but typically that that's what you take from it."
"4974360","4975580"," You imply from it."
"5047290","5048490"," Pretty good fucking morning. "
"5049190","5060980"," I'm gonna say"
"5060980","5062000"," it's a pretty good fucking morning."
"5067880","5069320"," They're right there I should say."
"5075890","5079070"," See if you get the rejection above and make another move lower. "
"5080430","5085230"," Be careful of be careful of not so much more not that we're not going to go kidding go down."
"5085510","5091350"," Just be careful of the grind sideways here where we don't make the new low for some time."
"5092070","5093110"," This might take some time. "
"5104020","5105620"," Congratulations bears you deserve it man."
"5106480","5111340"," I got to say like to be a bear the past bear past uh how long did it start?"
"5113840","5119600"," Let me uh look and see when exactly it started when you got when you not not got fucked but"
"5119600","5129510"," well like when it started it was basically at 3.80 on"
"5129510","5130790"," March 13th."
"5132070","5141790"," Like you could short along the way for some of it from like March 13th you could short until March"
"5141790","5147590"," 28th there was like a back and forth back and forth with higher lows but like we're going to sell"

"5177050","5184710"," you wanted like a low tick for bears bears if you want a low tick I'd be looking for 396"
"5184710","5192270"," 63 so if you want if you don't want they don't like that number if you don't like the 399"
"5192270","5199010"," number the 400 uh 396 would be what I'd be looking for for like a capitulation move if there was"
"5199010","5216340"," one yeah"
"5216340","5221800"," I'm going to expect some consolidation here bears need to hold this like they can't not hold this I"
"5221800","5227580"," guess they could squeeze up here all the way up here to hold it still could be a bull trap"

"5915150","5924990"," you understand what that means so the news matters in how it's being presented usually at a top"
"5924990","5934900"," or bottom it's not one twenty nine it changes goes from like one four it's not an image so i"
"5934900","5942500"," don't use emas i need to clarify here i do not use the emas i'm writing an ema for you"
"5942500","5950100"," that i adjust every day uh on this chart because weebel doesn't have real tools that i can uh"

"5966090","5971570"," it's not just angle or spin you guys need to i want you guys to understand you got there's some"
"5971570","5981550"," like this is like this is a fact that news as it's presented to you uh is presented to"
"5981550","5991010"," you for uh for when we're at support and resistance that's what it's there for um you need to be"
"5991010","5998270"," as a trader or an investor is a critical for you to understand uh the the the news as a"
"5998270","6004370"," tool and not just drink the news if you drink the news you're going to lose a lot"
"6006520","6016500"," of when i was a new trader i drank the news and then i would get crushed in a"

"6048000","6058590"," good news and how they relate to support and resistance supply and demand in the market and if"

"6151310","6161020"," pushed for you to consume not always but generally speaking to make any sense i don't think it"
"6161020","6165580"," makes sense or not i don't know who made that famous there's someone that made that famous is a"
"6165580","6172120"," book that came uh was talked about the first time i think it was one of the uh I think"

"6240370","6246770"," news confuses you it's this is this is a hard one this is a hard uh balancing act to walk"
"6250290","6260130"," for me for me most of the time if"
"6260130","6268430"," i trade with zero news i would do better than with all the news now there's a caveat there uh"
"6268430","6278270"," if some news there's a caveat there if there's market or"
"6278270","6286950"," there's news that's truly unknown to the market you can lose a lot of money so you so you can't"
"6286950","6295870"," really be just no news and i mean truly where there nobody knows the banks don't know this in"
"6295870","6305570"," advance um well i'll start at the beginning most banks know the news before it happens if you don't"
"6305570","6313650"," believe that i promise you banks keep offices matter of fact you can you can go on youtube and find"
"6313650","6324460"," bankers that are retired they'll do um um lectures"
"6324460","6333820"," at big universities they'll do lectures at Oxford, Yale, MIT, Harvard a lot of their all amount or"
"6333820","6339320"," they'll go back to and they'll discuss the inner workings of large banks and institutions and prime"
"6339320","6347040"," bank stuff like that you can read books about this too where people will write autobiographies or"
"6347040","6353500"," biographies and they'll talk about their time working in a bank these banks have people everywhere"
"6353500","6360260"," they pay people for information they have people in foreign countries look you should consider a"
"6360260","6370020"," bank to be like the CIA it would not surprise me if three letter agencies were even"
"6370020","6376040"," tied in with rep with bank representatives around the world you know that sounds shocking maybe to"
"6376040","6382420"," you but i assure you that these people have they open offices right now they're right now i"
"6382420","6391000"," guarantee there's a jpm office in ukraine and in and in russia uh in their doing their own"
"6391000","6397300"," intelligence to see make sure that they know before anyone else knows if there's ever going to be a"
"6397300","6405160"," truce cessation of fire anything before you ever know it before it hits cnn and likely at the same"
"6405160","6412540"," time that a three letter agency finds out they need to know this information so my point here is"
"6412540","6419680"," most news is is already known unless it hasn't been given publicly so there's a bunch of bunch of"
"6419680","6424600"," shit here if there's something that's unknown absolutely there will be market reactions that are"
"6424600","6429980"," wild uh and they usually revert back to norm bad or good usually not always but revert back nor"
"6429980","6434900"," known then there's a bunch of news that they know but you don't know and when it breaks they know"
"6434900","6440960"," to sell or buy the market before you do i'm going to give you a prime example of this uh"
"6440960","6449100"," this one it actually impacted me i was uh trade i was trade day trading one day and i had"
"6449100","6458860"," cnbc on and there was a reporter reporting live to the hosts of cnbc and the"
"6458860","6465000"," reporter thought that the news had already broken that tiktok was in negotiations with i believe"
"6465000","6474660"," microsoft now the uh the hosts of cnbc had to stop the reporter"
"6476340","6484900"," and say that news hasn't broken yet and that's where the fifth wall was broken it was where the"
"6484900","6491120"," hosts already knew that there were talks and negotiations the news hadn't broken publicly so these"
"6491120","6496780"," people knew they had material information the hosts had material information that there was"
"6496780","6503740"," negotiations with microsoft tiktok the reporter was like queued up to break the news but it had"
"6503740","6511420"," misinformation to not break the news watching right now bull's trying to break above in trade 409"
"6511420","6521180"," right now there's above staying above at 409 83 and anyways"
"6521180","6530820"," in this cnbc broadcast at that moment they hit the buy button a bunch of zero dates like for like"
"6530820","6539620"," a lot of money and moments later uh it went to the moon i mean the moon the moon and"
"6539620","6543740"," it just took moments for it to happen that shows you a few things that they know before you know"
"6543740","6552320"," it shows that they're already pre positioned and uh in the crazy part was because the news had"
"6552320","6557760"," broken before it was intended to break the market went to the moon or not the microsoft was the"
"6557760","6562660"," moon and then it reverted straight back down uh within 20 minutes or a half an hour back to the"
"6562660","6569060"," mean and that's because the banks aren't positioned yet uh they they're they're always before you"
"6569060","6574560"," this market is rigged i guarantee it to you unless there's something that's material materially"
"6574560","6584180"," unknown to banks or the market itself i assure you that it is so my point here is you can't"
"6584180","6589260"," just be zero news you have to have some form of news open and available to you at all times"
"6589260","6594680"," so if news bothers you or you don't trade well against the news or you don't understand how this"
"6594680","6600220"," works what i would say to you would be limit a lot of the news that you consume and just"
"6600220","6607040"," try to get a simple news feed it could be like financial juice it could be uh Walter Bloomberg uh"
"6607040","6611180"," you pick it there's a bunch out there there's a bunch of you guys can just ask on fin to"
"6611180","6616080"," it one fin to it and say hey what's the most unbiased uh direct news feed that i can have"
"6616080","6620820"," for me and then rather than reading what a fin twitter is interpreted as this is another key part"
"6620820","6628180"," uh the more familiar the more familiar you become with economic calendar news a lot of times man"
"6628180","6635520"," you'll see people drop inaccurate um interpretations of the news in the immediacy afterwards to try"
"6635520","6639760"," to get the trade to go their way these are regular fin tutors with like hundred thousand two"
"6639760","6645180"," hundred thousand thousand dollars so if you don't understand the news you have to learn what that"
"6645180","6650160"," news means on your own like side job and then the second thing for you to do would be to"
"6650160","6658580"," only be reading the news as it's presented one good thing i'll give to you would be um uh trade"
"6658580","6664860"," the news does a good job of unbiously interpreting it for you but it's very expensive that service"
"6664860","6670760"," it's like three to six hundred bucks a month depending on which plan you take and then financial"
"6670760","6676020"," juice does a good job and they're free and they'll they'll have a red banner if it's a negative"
"6676020","6681880"," story uh if you go to their website they have like a red banner that shows the news they're talking"
"6681880","6687660"," about and the tone of them reporting the news to you will tell you if it's negative or positive and"
"6687660","6692340"," that can and then the last part of that positive would be are we at a top when it comes"
"6692340","6699760"," out are we at a bottom when it comes out a known resistance a known support and so then if"
"6699760","6706240"," you're not biased in how you're reading that news and you say hey look we're at resistance here i"
"6706240","6714220"," know we're at resistance how this news is dropping right at this moment regardless of how it's"
"6714220","6719500"," interpreted it's probably a time to sell to make sense if you're if we're at a bottom a known"
"6719500","6727240"," support and you see news drop that's material it's likely being used to for a reason for the market"
"6727240","6750050"," to go up to"
"6750050","6756370"," that reporter could have steamed it was kind of funny um it's kind of funny because it was the only"
"6756370","6761130"," reason they got the trade was because it was right time right place uh so right now i don't watch"
"6761130","6768750"," or listen to CNBC at all but as a matter of fact i'm a tesla bull and uh i've been"
"6768750","6774230"," a tesla bull for many years right and i was like a guy that was buying tesla when nobody bought"
"6774230","6782550"," tesla and it kind of ground sideways and up but really didn't do anything and uh in the beginning"
"6782550","6787150"," it was great to be a tesla bull because uh all the news is kind of good news in some"
"6787150","6795330"," way but it wasn't it didn't make the stock go up but then after a lot of years tesla news"
"6795330","6803150"," and being a smart tesla bull didn't produce the returns that i was looking for and so i had to"
"6803150","6809730"," actually stop following tesla as closely as i used to years ago i followed tesla i knew everything"
"6809730","6816710"," about tesla but uh i started to lose money at some point on tesla because it it clouded my judgment"
"6816710","6824610"," in being a tesla bull so me personally it helped me not to uh drink kool-aid anymore and you"

"11660680","11661640"," Oh, you know what I told me for God?"
"11661800","11662140"," Well, absolutely."

"11761000","11762360"," They're called Northern Guard."
"11762660","11764540"," Guys don't know who Northern Guard is."
"11765120","11767220"," They're like a, um, football. "
"11768000","11769620"," Uh, well, I'm supporters."

"11852020","11852780"," Junior's your friend."
"11852820","11854120"," Well, I'm going off to say something. "

"11858500","11860320"," Give me an autograph for my kids, man."
"11868120","11869880"," Yeah, we watched World Cup, remember?"
"11870280","11871080"," We had the World Cup on."
"11871240","11872960"," We had the World Cup on while we were trading. "
"11875660","11878340"," Hell, yeah, Muhammad."
"11883500","11887820"," You went to school with Christian politics, man."
"11892720","11894740"," Captain Ron used to work for US soccer. "
"11895200","11895500"," Dang."
"11896320","11898180"," A bunch of you guys are soccer players here."
"11898820","11902800"," I played D2 soccer. "
"11903980","11906180"," Oh, you know, squeezing up right now."
"11906300","11907760"," It's getting that big squeeze on."
"11909180","11911700"," Squeeze and higher above the hourly trigger right now. "
"11911840","11916140"," They basically announced that they were going to watch in the VIX in the background right here."
"11916240","11917400"," We have more squeeze than to do."
"11917420","11918420"," We could squeeze straight up. "
"11918660","11920840"," All right, fuck it."
"11920980","11922120"," Let's do it."
"11923380","11924100"," 103 count to 20. "
"11924360","11926360"," Two, one, two, one, and nine trillion dollars."
"11926560","11928120"," That's reverse reporporation."
"11928680","11929880"," VIX is not showing itself. "
"11930240","11931260"," VIX traded in 1931."
"11931760","11934920"," It's got 1913 left to go to get down to the hourly on VIX."
"11934920","11936780"," Squeezing higher right now. "
"11936780","11937920"," I'm long calls right here."

"11946220","11954900"," And we are going to see the VIX get all the way down to $19.13. I wanted to maybe"
"11954900","11956400"," speak in the hallway. "
"11956960","11959100"," Hell, you guys worked for US soccer."
"11959420","11960880"," That's righteous right on."
"11960880","11968160"," If he was your client, Glenn, what would you tell the former president to do in this moment going"
"11968160","11969640"," for his arraignment?"
"11970840","11974940"," Number one, I would tell him to keep his mouth shut, but that's not very practical with Donald"
"11974940","11975260"," Trump. "
"11976360","11983040"," My standard statement when the press comes up to me when I'm going into a court hearing is my"
"11983040","11985660"," client's going to plead not guilty because he is not guilty."
"11985660","11990220"," And that would be a good statement for him to make is that I'm going to plead not guilty because"
"11990220","11990940"," I am not guilty."
"11991480","11997020"," And his attorney should remind America that he's innocent and felt proven guilty. "
"11997600","12000180"," And these are just accusations and they're not convictions."
"12001880","12004760"," Very, very true to bring that."
"12004780","12006320"," Price target 409-15. "
"12006680","12011140"," Let me hear from just with the attorney Alvin Bragg a little bit later there after this"
"12011140","12011860"," arraignment."
"12014560","12019560"," Right now it's paid in 1927 right now on VIX."
"12019740","12023160"," It could be as high as 34 pounds. "
"12024040","12031940"," What is your thinking on that and hearing that is that a super high number for a case"
"12031940","12039440"," like this?"
"12039440","12042180"," And so, you know, that's not a shocking number."
"12042400","12044920"," I mean, I've seen cases with 100 counts."
"12045580","12050760"," But, you know, again, until we see what they are, you know, they could all be tacky tacky little"
"12050760","12055800"," like you put this down in your financial statement when it should have been this, you know, real"
"12055800","12059100"," minor, you know, minor errors accounting errors. "
"12059100","12063900"," On the one minute, sir, I've got the one minute coming up right now looking for a bull cross right"
"12063900","12064220"," now."
"12065240","12069480"," There we go."
"12069660","12074100"," And I want to show you this one right here to our viewers, maybe just coming on. "
"12074320","12076940"," Do this fucking guys always late, isn't he?"
"12077800","12079240"," You guys remember in 2020?"
"12080380","12084420"," He'd say he's going to have a presser and he'd be sitting here waiting for like fucking 45 minutes"
"12084420","12086280"," or an hour for a presser to start."
"12087720","12097390"," Because we're waiting on that shot really all morning long there at the motorcade and outside"
"12100940","12101680"," of here."
"12101700","12103880"," Trade in 26 cents right now in 410 C."
"12104900","12108120"," Be careful of a retest down below. "
"12108680","12109780"," Normally you'll get one."
"12109960","12114700"," This is a one minute chart right here, but you always be careful of some kind of a retest down"
"12114700","12116740"," below to confirm that the trade is up here."
"12116740","12122060"," You know, as far as who gets to set at council table, that's generally you can see it right now. "
"12122240","12124240"," The attorneys and the defendant."
"12124900","12129000"," Now they can probably they can be stationed throughout the courtroom secret service."
"12129060","12133260"," In fact, they may even be inside the bar standing, you know, off to the side. "
"12133900","12138760"," But, you know, they can't they can't say you can't have your secret service people there."
"12139080","12141780"," And so that's who's going to be there."
"12141780","12146840"," Now this is open to the public and I guarantee there's not a long line of people trying to get"
"12146840","12147280"," into this. "
"12147480","12149120"," Yeah, remember he would do that bullshit."
"12149120","12150700"," Remember he'd be machine gun tweeting."
"12151620","12157260"," Someone on Twitch just said, meanwhile, while we're awaiting he'd be machine gun tweeting. "
"12157440","12165060"," That was some crazy as"
"12165060","12171760"," shit."
"12171760","12172760"," He's exploring careers in economics."
"12173360","12175500"," A text is expected, but no Q&A. "
"12175880","12180380"," Bear in mind that Feds Collins is also due to speak at this event at one forty five PM."
"12181020","12184860"," We have posted the live video to this event on the feed for all those interested."
"12185300","12186680"," Or the arraignment there. "
"12187060","12191460"," And when I got to ask you to as well, as when we're talking about."
"12191740","12197120"," Kind of like the last spot here for sellers, you can see that this is where the last hedges right"
"12197120","12197420"," here."
"12199540","12203480"," Right in here is the last of this hedge right here trying to sell this market down. "
"12203600","12205580"," Just be warned right here that right where we are."
"12212000","12214460"," But just right where you are right here in this chart."
"12214700","12217400"," This is kind of like the last cell pressure in the market. "
"12218720","12224420"," So if bears are going to maintain control in here, this is kind of it right here, right?"
"12224420","12226060"," This is where the bears step in."
"12227260","12231740"," So if you're long calls here, you could also do a straddle or a strangle."
"12231880","12236520"," Grab some 407 Ps for down here just in case we start heading back down. "
"12236880","12244100"," If you are just long calls here and either put a stop on because there could be a liquidity break"
"12244100","12245080"," or grab down here."
"12245560","12250800"," Even if we're going to continue higher or you can grab some puts out some four or seven Ps in"
"12250800","12252480"," case the market rolls here."
"12252480","12254200"," Watch that yellow line right there. "
"12254260","12260200"," We're going to take sides about this trial and that's going to affect the election."
"12260660","12263500"," So it's going to be really interesting to see how this plays out."
"12263920","12264480"," Yes. "
"12264780","12264880"," Yes."
"12265400","12272500"," And now we are continuing to showcase the motor phase passing a bounce right now on VIX."
"12272500","12280180"," And I also want to talk about a little bit more about these 815 Eastern really remarks that we've"
"12280180","12282540"," been making back at Marlago. "
"12283100","12288040"," And it'll be interesting to see what he can say and what he will serve."
"12288640","12293360"," I'm really sure that if he's given the opportunity to speak."
"12293480","12295180"," Yeah, Travis, do you see that bull plane?"
"12295940","12297060"," It's right there, man. "
"12297460","12298140"," It's right in Iraq."
"12298920","12300500"," I'm long on calls right now."
"12301220","12302140"," Right here, man. "
"12302280","12302620"," You see it?"
"12302800","12304960"," And generally he has a lot to say."
"12305260","12312980"," And I'm sure he will rail against the system and rail against prosecutor Bragg and he will defend"
"12312980","12313400"," his innocent."
"12313720","12317200"," Somebody tell the sell side to take the fucking heads off the market. "
"12317340","12320660"," Well, and now I just want to show our viewers here."
"12321200","12325680"," The protest rally happening right outside of the courthouse as well."
"12325680","12332860"," And we are waiting there for the former president to make his way up the steps there of the"
"12332860","12335920"," courthouse and into the building there. "
"12336460","12341280"," And the moment bears need to quit playing and crash the market."
"12342420","12348720"," Donald Trump actually wanted to be handcuffed and was thinking that it would be a good move to be"
"12348720","12355060"," seen in handcuffs there as a political moment there."
"12355060","12363040"," In history, what would you have thought of seeing the president of their handcuffs and would that"
"12363040","12364480"," even have been a possibility?"
"12364480","12371800"," I know he wanted it, but would that even have thinking in the realm of possibility to happen?"
"12372440","12377880"," Well, it was a possibility and normally when people self surrender when they're transported from"
"12377880","12379080"," wherever they are. "
"12379080","12380820"," And that's a part of this where you've got 300."
"12381340","12386540"," So right now there's 312,000 for 10's peas out there."
"12386880","12391040"," They're worth $1.25. They were like two bucks and changed earlier. "
"12392240","12395560"," So there's still some fuel left for a move higher here."
"12395680","12397560"," Everybody in the country watching this."
"12398020","12399000"," I mean, what's he going to do?"
"12399340","12400840"," Run or punch somebody. "
"12401540","12408260"," So, you know, he's not he's going to be fine and it's the smart thing to do as far as"
"12408260","12409340"," the prosecution goes."
"12410000","12416020"," Because again, had he had he had Trump handcuffed and did a per walk with the handcuffs, then"
"12416020","12419540"," everybody would say, see this is a political."
"12419800","12424000"," Chase Winters say in market may just pump and pump until nobody wants to be short. "
"12424400","12426180"," Indeed, in big names, there are a few shorts."
"12426930","12430100"," Then dumps because without shorts, there are a few buyers on way down."
"12433080","12437720"," Trade in 409.07 right now coming up into S1. "
"12440660","12446180"," S1 is where these little orange bars are right there."
"12446180","12452760"," Right here just right outside of the courthouse, the show and the former president are coming out"
"12452760","12455960"," of the S4.10 C's trade in 28 cents right now."
"12463380","12465320"," Be careful of the role here. "
"12465460","12470060"," This is where you'll get your recheck on the bull flag, the bull plane."
"12470060","12475520"," On exploring careers in economics, the text is expected, but no Q&A."
"12475860","12481580"," Bear in mind that at the same event, 145 PM Eastern time, Fred Collins also speaks. "
"12482140","12484720"," We have the live video on the feed for all those interested."
"12485480","12487980"," Yeah, we've got Cook coming up at 145."
"12489500","12497680"," At this moment, but let's also talk again going for the viewers here, maybe just coming on and"
"12497680","12499420"," seeing these pictures right outside. "
"12499420","12500220"," Oh, it was yesterday."
"12500580","12501340"," Cook was on yesterday."
"12501920","12505020"," We've got Meister today or Meister today at 6 PM. "
"12523300","12530000"," So I've got some music playing in the background."
"12530580","12538620"," That is Cook and Collins speaking at on careers in economics at 130."
"12540680","12545320"," So this is where the hedge is on the market right now on both of these events taking place. "
"12547680","12550360"," So you'll know there's a hedge here, so be careful here."
"12594880","12600420"," Walter Bloomberg is reporting that Trump arrives at Manhattan DA's office just a few moments ago."
"12611260","12616120"," Yeah, I want you guys to know right now that there is a hedge on the market currently. "
"12616640","12619760"," So right now there's sell side with a hedge on the market right here."
"12620100","12621620"," They're waiting two events."
"12622000","12625880"," We've got Trump that's doing some shit at the DA office. "
"12626580","12636370"," And then we've got Cook and Collins, little Fed President, they're having"
"12636370","12639470"," a, they're speaking on careers in economics."
"12639990","12647070"," So you should just get a quick, normally at these pressers, so the Cook and Collins one, you'll get"
"12647070","12648790"," shit thrown against the wall, right?"
"12649070","12651790"," Whatever they're trying to, whatever the message is, the message."
"12653850","12661050"," So that once that comes off, then you'll get some kind of nonsense garbage from Trump and the hedge"
"12661050","12662950"," should come off the market at that point. "
"12670150","12679030"," I would note here that I would definitely note here that Trump, Trump is a counterpoint to the"
"12679030","12681570"," market in terms of it's squeezing higher."
"12681850","12684430"," Biden tends to have a negative impact on the market where we go down."
"12684850","12690710"," Trump tends to have an impact tends to have an impact on the market where it goes up. "
"12691670","12697650"," He'll say something crazy like, I don't know, I'll make all the more money and we'll stop this"
"12697650","12698490"," crazy fed."
"12698970","12700330"," Something stupid like that."
"12701150","12702930"," And the market will rip face on that. "
"12702930","12705070"," Shortly expecting comments from heads good."
"12766050","12770670"," Looks like Trump is either coming out or just went into the DA's office."
"12795310","12795670"," This is the money. "
"12795670","12797730"," Hold on here, we've got the economic things starting here."
"12798050","12804350"," I don't think they have any audio."
"12812080","12814560"," The exploring careers and economics. "
"12816300","12818080"," Speech has zero audio."
"12830580","12831720"," The exploring careers."
"12831940","12832920"," Hello, good afternoon. "
"12832920","12838020"," Thank you for joining the Federal Reserve Board at our spring exploring careers and economics."
"12838800","12842420"," We're grateful for the time you choose to spend with us and are excited to continue hosting this."

"12844040","12845760"," So if you know anyone that might benefit from watching this later, feel free to share."
"12846180","12847900"," My name is Jocelyn Jackson and I'm the lead economics outreach specialist."
"12848260","12851180"," My work focuses on bringing transparency to our application and interview processes and empowering"
"12851180","12852300"," students to opt in to our opportunities. "
"12852880","12853540"," We have a packed hour today."
"12853740","12857020"," You'll hear from Governor Elizabeth Cook, followed by the Boston Fed President, and from a panel of"
"12857020","12858260"," research assistants across the Federal Reserve System."
"12858640","12862000"," We do our best to address questions that we receive and our goal for you today is to feel more"
"12862000","12867600"," confident about pursuing econ studies and a career in economics. "
"12868540","12873560"," At the end of our session today, for those of you who joined via WebEx, you'll have the option to"
"12873560","12878880"," stay and join a breakout room to further engage with research assistants and fed staff."
"12878880","12884360"," If you're watching via the Federal Reserve website or YouTube, visit our website to learn how else"
"12884360","12886260"," you might engage with us in the future."
"12887020","12889040"," Yeah, Dan, I'm watching in the background, man. "
"12889160","12890820"," I'm keeping my eyes on the VIX right now."
"12890900","12892980"," That will lead you down the path of economics."
"12893100","12894540"," Looking like it's going to roll doesn't it?"
"12894620","12895400"," Doesn't it, Dan?"
"12897160","12899500"," There's definitely a trap here for bulls. "
"12900740","12903320"," Event will hear opening remarks from Governor Cook."
"12904180","12905880"," Governor Lisa Cook took office."
"12905880","12911000"," If you are along here, you're at high risk of liquidation, a pretty decent sized liquidation break. "
"12911660","12916400"," Prior to her appointment at the board, Dr. Cook was a professor of economics and international"
"12916400","12918320"," relations at Michigan State University."
"12919240","12921660"," She was also a research associate at the National Bureau."
"12921940","12924420"," I think I'm going to close at 27 cents right now. "
"12925180","12926700"," Pretty risky trade here."
"12926760","12929420"," He's here at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government."
"12930100","12935620"," During her time at Harvard, Dr. Cook also served as deputy director for Africa Research at the"
"12935620","12937060"," Center of International Development. "
"12937840","12939040"," Before then, she was a national..."
"12939040","12940700"," Did I just take the penny and run or no?"
"12941540","12945080"," Dr. Cook received a BAN philosophy from Spelman College."
"12945080","12946620"," Trade in 28 cents right now."
"12947020","12948840"," She received a second BAN. "
"12948860","12950060"," 29 cents right now."
"12950220","12952260"," Takes an economics from Oxford University."
"12953300","12956800"," She earned her PhD in economics from the University of California. "
"12957260","12959380"," Trade in 409-22."
"12959740","12960140"," Governor Cook."
"12963860","12964760"," Good afternoon. "
"12965660","12966900"," Vicks still bleeding now."
"12966960","12968140"," Trade in 19-17."
"12969900","12972460"," I'm disappointed I cannot be with you in person. "
"12973580","12975980"," 19-12 is what you're looking for in the Vicks."
"12977440","12979400"," Probably going to take the money and run here."
"12979880","12981440"," Trade in 32 cents. "
"12982740","12985860"," There we go."
"12985920","12988460"," I got a fill in 32 cents on 410C."
"12988800","12990080"," Now it's trading 33 cents. "
"12990640","12992860"," Be careful as we squeeze up here."
"12993740","12995080"," There's a little bit more room."
"12995520","13000880"," Like Vicks is trade $19.16. Be careful of a swift reversal here. "
"13001620","13005020"," And you can see its impact in the world outside your door."
"13005640","13006540"," And inside as well."
"13008060","13010960"," Some of you are veterans of economic study. "
"13011480","13013460"," Well, some of you are just econ curious."
"13013980","13015640"," Still nothing on Trump right now."
"13015780","13016760"," They're showing a video. "
"13017020","13017640"," Oh, there it goes."
"13019600","13021000"," I'm flat right now."
"13021140","13022860"," There's a big reversal on Vicks. "
"13023480","13024220"," Or on spy."
"13024540","13026460"," By academics in a college town."
"13027280","13029260"," But even that access and insight. "
"13029520","13030180"," Big reversal."
"13030560","13032700"," Big old trap Ola right there."
"13034780","13037160"," Vicks with a bounce on the hourly just then. "
"13038880","13041600"," We live in a constantly changing world."
"13042260","13044820"," Which means there's always new research to undertake."
"13045420","13047940"," Questions to be posed and ground to break. "
"13048700","13051120"," If you have a delay on which reset your browser."
"13051120","13052280"," So you head with me."
"13052500","13056020"," From the impact of patents on the nation's economic growth. "
"13056700","13059580"," To the banking system in post-Soviet Russia."
"13060600","13062360"," They also took me to the archives."
"13062620","13065440"," For 10 still selling to are still at 28 cents. "
"13065760","13069760"," So if you get trapped in there, you probably get another another out at some point."
"13070940","13073660"," My career has taken me all over the globe."
"13075350","13077690"," Economics can take you just about anywhere. "
"13078490","13079990"," Figuratively and literally."
"13081090","13083150"," I'll say the Vicks bounce real quick."
"13083330","13083550"," Hold on. "
"13083770","13087050"," Do a good job of showing you the world possibilities in the field."
"13088030","13089950"," Because economics needs you."
"13091090","13095490"," Any field that studies the behavior of an entire population. "
"13095530","13097010"," As economics does."
"13097710","13100130"," Should reflect the population it studies."
"13101170","13104470"," We all come to the table with different experiences and backgrounds. "
"13105490","13107990"," Which give each of us unique perspectives."
"13108490","13110150"," So you really want to see here in the Vicks is."
"13110750","13115130"," It's the one in the five minute coming down on it. "
"13115190","13117270"," You're seeing the bounce on the hourly right here."
"13117370","13120350"," The experiences are different from anyone else's."
"13121330","13125790"," That insight and understanding will be critical to policy makers. "
"13125790","13129250"," What you don't want to see is the Vicks star ripping face up here."
"13130090","13131490"," The Vicks rips up here."
"13131570","13132370"," Markets going to bleed. "
"13133510","13137790"," If you want the safe trade as a bull, you want to see the Vicks get down here."
"13139350","13141770"," So you're looking for a Vicks to break."
"13143190","13145730"," $19.13. Finally on that note. "
"13146490","13150050"," I would like to encourage everyone to reach out to others joining today."
"13150170","13156170"," So the idea here is unless you see the Vicks break $19.13. This is a trap for bulls."
"13156490","13159490"," And they're going to sell this right down over here. "
"13159670","13161850"," So just be real careful the Vicks right now."
"13161950","13163150"," The professional landscape."
"13164110","13168810"," And they will offer both support and advice as you advance in your career. "
"13169810","13173930"," And we do hope that for some of you that path is economics."
"13174930","13178330"," And you will make the Federal Reserve a stop along the way."
"13179490","13182350"," Thank you for joining us and enjoy the day. "
"13188280","13189920"," Vicks still bullish currently."
"13191620","13194040"," Thank you, Governor Cook for your message today."
"13194580","13198780"," I'm happy to move into our next segment and introduce Susan M."
"13199160","13201880"," Collins, President and CEO of the Boston Fed. "
"13202620","13206580"," Susan joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in July of 2022."
"13207160","13209660"," She oversees all the bank's activities, including."
"13210040","13211700"," White House is giving a briefing right now. "
"13211700","13214560"," Banking supervision and financial stability efforts."
"13215240","13220280"," Community economic development activities in a wide range of payments, technology and financial"
"13220280","13220900"," initiatives."
"13221200","13223800"," I want to buy both sides of this right now. "
"13224020","13226320"," With a lifelong interest in policy."
"13226620","13229100"," I want to buy like 407s and 410s."
"13229100","13232020"," Published widely and served as Provost Dean. "
"13232500","13239780"," We've got 38 cent trade at a variety of universities and organizations, including the Federal"
"13239780","13243840"," Reserve Bank of Chicago, where she served as Director for nine years."
"13244660","13248600"," Susan earned her PhD in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."
"13249360","13251540"," Susan, thank you so much for joining us today. "
"13252360","13254480"," It's absolutely a pleasure to be here."
"13254700","13257400"," And I'm going to say up front apologies for my voice."
"13257860","13266700"," It is recovering, but I've been looking forward to our conversation and to being with all of our"
"13266700","13270700"," potentially aspiring economists on the call today. "
"13271360","13272240"," Thank you."
"13272860","13278060"," So during our time together today, I'd like for us to get to know you a little bit more with"
"13278060","13279060"," some kind of rapid."
"13279220","13281040"," This is weak by the bears disappointed. "
"13281840","13283220"," Don't poke the bears."
"13283220","13284800"," And we're open to you."
"13286560","13288240"," You would like to share with us today. "
"13289700","13290220"," Absolutely."
"13290800","13293140"," We can get started."
"13293460","13294480"," So quick questions first. "
"13295280","13296920"," What does your morning routine look like?"
"13298000","13301360"," So when I get up, I really need my first cup of coffee."
"13301820","13307700"," And I like to combine that with a bit of news."
"13308040","13310580"," So I typically am looking at different newspapers. "
"13310580","13312460"," I'm also an NPR junkie."
"13313220","13318780"," And so I always have that first cup of coffee and enjoy it."
"13318920","13321660"," And sometimes we need the fucking VIX to get up there, dude. "
"13322920","13325300"," Is your best work done in the morning?"
"13325740","13326900"," Or are you a night owl?"
"13328280","13329080"," So that's interesting."
"13329360","13332200"," I can fix the still trade in 1921 right now."
"13332240","13333260"," Ask me some years ago. "
"13333600","13336820"," I would have said always at night in part because you have like this."
"13338020","13341140"," Even if we trade up here, let's look at this real quick."
"13341440","13343760"," It's like even if we trade up here. "
"13344000","13346820"," And I don't know whether that was many years of having kids."
"13346940","13350940"," Even if we trade up here, the fucking VIX, we need to get the VIX up there."
"13352460","13356260"," This is setting up right now is the grind higher trade. "
"13356820","13360360"," Where we go down to the hourly and just start fucking grinding again."
"13361800","13363600"," I don't want to grind here."
"13363600","13366320"," That's where we're setting up right now is the grind higher. "
"13366320","13367840"," I was actually a full bag."
"13367840","13368680"," Grind higher trade."
"13369300","13370300"," Women's soccer team. "
"13371100","13376480"," And with something that I enjoyed tremendously had not been a bit."
"13376480","13377020"," Come on Bears."
"13377580","13380280"," In high school or middle school. "
"13380280","13381440"," Fucking Bears man."
"13382040","13389260"," Just loved the opportunity to be on a team and to engage in a very different way with friends and"
"13389260","13389760"," others."
"13389760","13393520"," So that was just a fun experience that many people don't know about me. "
"13394000","13395020"," I love that."
"13395480","13396400"," Thanks for sharing."
"13398280","13405160"," So part of your story is that you navigated your studies and your professional life as an"
"13405160","13405640"," introvert. "
"13406320","13409740"," And I was hoping that you could talk to us today more about."
"13409800","13411180"," No trade for me right now."
"13411320","13414660"," Practice you've had to speak up. "
"13414820","13415740"," Turn her down for a minute."
"13415880","13416760"," Hold on."
"13417840","13418380"," Sure. "
"13419000","13421880"," And you know this is actually something that I."
"13423000","13426520"," Most of my career was in higher ed."
"13427100","13428400"," But I spent a lot of time."
"13428400","13428640"," Now. "
"13430900","13432920"," I got to be honest with you."
"13433060","13434600"," I want to see this come down."
"13434900","13435320"," I'm a bull. "
"13435480","13439900"," I want to see this come down because I want some room to run."
"13440520","13443040"," I want something to buy down here."
"13444780","13448240"," And what they're doing is they're buying this fucking dip right on this hourly. "
"13448680","13450020"," It doesn't give us a ton of room."
"13450380","13451240"," Like it gives us."
"13451660","13457040"," And there's no one like I used to get tremendous stage. "
"13457360","13457400"," Right."
"13457940","13461190"," And did not want to."
"13463790","13465410"," You know was advised. "
"13465630","13466110"," Yeah."
"13466590","13467550"," This is bullish as fuck."
"13467550","13467990"," Isn't it?"
"13468070","13469250"," And it gets a lot easier. "
"13469430","13470010"," It is bullish."
"13471170","13471650"," So."
"13473130","13482760"," You know since I didn't speak up a lot in class and especially graduate school. "
"13482760","13484460"," That can be really important."
"13484780","13489060"," But what I would do is I would make lists of my questions and go to office hours and get"
"13489060","13495420"," to know the faculty or teaching assistant and who talked to them about."
"13495620","13502600"," So would this have been a good question to ask in class and started becoming more vocal in class as"
"13502600","13502820"," well. "
"13503160","13505760"," You know also say some students who are too vocal in class."
"13506060","13508180"," That's actually not helpful either."
"13511460","13513460"," And so you have a really good sound. "
"13515000","13518440"," Who's saying what and how to interact in different ways."
"13518820","13521920"," So you know I'm also a big preparer."
"13522300","13524560"," I think being ready to do things is really helpful. "
"13525300","13527540"," And over time it just does get a lot easier."
"13528040","13529780"," And at least for me I found that I."
"13530020","13533220"," You know there's like there's a spy trade here up."
"13537780","13539780"," I love those pieces of advice. "
"13539780","13542780"," I'll tell you there's a spy trade here that's up."
"13543000","13545840"," A lot of practice there."
"13546100","13547340"," But I fucking want this. "
"13547640","13550420"," Whether it's here or it's right here."
"13551000","13552980"," I want this fucking trade down so bad."
"13553760","13554580"," Because I'll be honest with you. "
"13554820","13557440"," I mean we're coming right back up to you're talking about."
"13557680","13562440"," It may seem as if this particular skill takes forever to grow."
"13562440","13568360"," You're talking about an area up here that is now right here. "
"13568920","13572180"," This is the next cell zone right here."
"13575220","13578660"," So any kind of even if we squeeze up here."
"13580120","13582300"," The way is down is my point. "
"13582480","13585480"," Not down but you know it's that constant grind up."
"13585480","13590420"," I used to get really really there but all before."
"13591300","13592840"," And people would say oh you know. "
"13592840","13593580"," Yeah get it down."
"13593740","13594200"," Get it down."
"13594340","13596840"," Because it feels like you're just like raising a bar. "
"13597660","13598620"," And it's not particularly."
"13599160","13601220"," I'm going to make this a two part trade here."
"13601620","13604440"," The stakes are even higher if you mess up. "
"13605620","13609120"," And you know and it was one time that I remember really clearly."
"13609800","13611380"," When I was just having a lot of trouble sleeping."
"13611700","13613780"," And I realized that you know what?"
"13614380","13617460"," I noticed every time and I think you used to it. "
"13617820","13622260"," And so I realized over time it's almost like that's."
"13622340","13624220"," I'm long right now 408 puts."
"13624980","13626240"," And that's why a lot of my energy. "
"13626540","13629740"," And I will fucking add them again if we squeeze."
"13630420","13632440"," So I'm long 408 puts right here."
"13633540","13635880"," And if we squeeze all the way up to here I'm just going to add them again. "
"13637960","13641080"," And you know part of my energy and part of my."
"13641080","13645520"," That bottom at 29 cents they're trading 32 cents right now."
"13650720","13652500"," I'll be honest I don't. "
"13652500","13654760"," I mean this is kind of like I shouldn't trade like this but."
"13655680","13660040"," I don't fucking want to buy spy right here."
"13660220","13664000"," I don't want to buy spy right here. "
"13664300","13665480"," I need to see the spy."
"13666600","13668780"," I need to see the the VIX just."
"13668780","13672460"," I mean I don't need the VIX to fucking 30 or nothing but. "
"13672560","13674620"," I need the fucking VIX to like."
"13674960","13679980"," I don't want to trade this up with the VIX at 19 and change."
"13680420","13686460"," That I have done through loud is to find someone who is going to be there at least one person"
"13686460","13689680"," and say you know I want to get better at this. "
"13690020","13695260"," So after I'm done I'm going to ask you to tell me what do you think I did well and"
"13695260","13697500"," what's a suggestion for something I could do better."
"13697500","13699780"," And then you realize saying that."
"13700320","13702260"," Spine out trading 408 61. "
"13702520","13707800"," Each time you do it you're going to learn something and you're going to hopefully grow in a"
"13707800","13708360"," different way."
"13708620","13712640"," And that also trade 36 cents on 408 38 cents."
"13712780","13714480"," It didn't seem like it was a one shot thing. "
"13715900","13720480"," So those are some of the things that have been helpful for me and I have to say I now"
"13720480","13726480"," enjoy being able to be in front of a group especially if I can explain something complicated or"
"13726480","13726780"," sharing."
"13726780","13728360"," I'm long puts right now."
"13730180","13732580"," Now trading 40 cents on 408 P."
"13735160","13739840"," You know like bears bears I can get stopped out in this trade but. "
"13740240","13742900"," If I get stopped out of this trade."
"13744040","13744980"," I'll take it again."
"13744980","13746920"," I'll take it again here too. "
"13747220","13748640"," I'll take it again right here at 410."
"13748640","13754080"," I don't fucking want I'm serious I want to buy a I don't want to buy a spy."
"13754540","13757520"," I don't want to buy fucking spy with VIXET 19. "
"13758740","13760740"," Where's it at right now."
"13761700","13764040"," So to recap I took away that."
"13764340","13768280"," VIXET 1935 you know what I want to buy the spy with like. "
"13768520","13773580"," I don't know VIXET like at least 20 this crazy like even saying this."
"13773580","13776080"," I think VIXET 20 maybe."
"13779600","13780800"," 21 something. "
"13781760","13785080"," And then finally you seek out feedback."
"13787660","13791880"," Absolutely and you know getting the help of others is kind of a thing."
"13793320","13797220"," We already had us two down here get tagged we're looking for S3 down below. "
"13803180","13805680"," If we start trading above up here."
"13806960","13809420"," I'll stop myself up but for right now."
"13810220","13813080"," I got put from like where S1 is right here. "
"13813100","13820000"," And I'd like to chat about that exchange of life and work for two minutes."
"13821060","13824360"," I know some people call it a balance some people call it an exchange."
"13824360","13826320"," I definitely now as a mom. "
"13826560","13829400"," I have to all step back in above here at 4 10."
"13829580","13832160"," I'm like looking at this and I'm like what are we going to we're going to trade the VIXET out"
"13832160","13834360"," of 17 maybe."
"13835560","13842080"," So as a mom I struggle with this and I'm definitely seeking advice for myself and for others who"
"13842080","13844460"," will one day be in the same situation. "
"13844780","13847220"," So I know at different points."
"13847220","13849340"," The way is down I promise you."
"13854540","13859260"," Or not I can't promise right now VIX is trying to work its way back up right now. "
"13861980","13863160"," VIX and a three trigger."
"13863520","13867320"," I need the VIX to stay above the one minute to be honest."
"13867840","13868740"," It is hard. "
"13869020","13870580"," It is definitely hard."
"13871280","13873100"," But it's also really rewarding."
"13873640","13876280"," I mean I would say that having children. "
"13876760","13877860"," You're long in video."
"13878300","13878400"," Yeah."
"13878880","13880020"," I mean I get it. "
"13880220","13886600"," I get that this I get I mean I get the idea that I get the idea here that I"
"13886600","13892240"," get the idea that we're going to break above that declining resistance above us."
"13893420","13897000"," I too agree with that that we're going to break above that declining resistance."
"13897180","13898440"," I'm still on board. "
"13899000","13900500"," So right here is where it is."
"13900860","13902460"," I'm not going to show it to you."
"13903080","13904980"," It's like a line going at an angle. "
"13907180","13911400"," I agree that once this comes up here that we're going to break above it."
"13917200","13919400"," I'm not in disagreement that we're going there."
"13923860","13925580"," I just don't like buying it right. "
"13925580","13927120"," I don't like buying it right here."
"13928340","13930680"," We look at some stuff here."
"13930780","13930960"," Hold on. "
"13931080","13936440"," So you know when I did wait until after I had tenure before."
"13936920","13940720"," I was an older mom when my daughter arrived."
"13941240","13946920"," And I'd also done a lot of things which I think made it easier for me to say no to"
"13946920","13947720"," a number of trips. "
"13947720","13951340"," International Congress one of the I got to do was travel a lot."
"13952380","13954740"," Really not only enjoyed but continue to enjoy."
"13955780","13962600"," And so I did I was quite explicit that there were times when it's just important not only for me"
"13962600","13963120"," to be there. "
"13963320","13966200"," But sometimes I just had to be there because I have to might be traveling."
"13967140","13971100"," So we did relocate when my kids were younger to be near family."
"13971480","13975580"," That helped a lot and we leveraged their time and resources. "
"13975580","13981820"," But I think that it's also important to both know yourself and what's most important to you."
"13982400","13991700"," And also to recognize that other people can help you navigate what's most important to do and where"
"13991700","13992340"," to say no."
"13993020","13999160"," Because if you say yes it often turns out that more and more people to ask you to do things. "
"13999480","14003220"," I think that is especially true for women and people of color."
"14003220","14008540"," I mean I realized at one point when I was an assistant professor that I felt like I was."
"14008540","14009560"," Yeah it's another one right. "
"14009740","14011480"," It's either here or it's above."
"14016390","14021370"," I hate these fucking half like they're all different."
"14021570","14024070"," To do stuff. "
"14024370","14027470"," And so even though I was saying no I was doing."
"14027930","14033630"," My conviction is that it trades down right here or right here."
"14034550","14037890"," So if I get stopped out here I'll just reload again above. "
"14048310","14051170"," They get proven otherwise."
"14052650","14054290"," I'll cut them loose above here."
"14069470","14070670"," I'm all four. "
"14071070","14072170"," I'm all four going up."
"14072190","14072750"," I get it."
"14074010","14077490"," But I don't want to fucking trade the grind higher. "
"14077810","14078890"," I'll be honest I don't want to."
"14079130","14080750"," I don't want to trade the grind higher."
"14080770","14082270"," I just want a nice dip to buy. "
"14084050","14086930"," If this is the dip to buy and we're going to grind higher."
"14087530","14088770"," It's not going to suck."
"14088990","14090950"," It's just going to be the whole week will suck. "
"14092130","14094690"," It'll be by the dip down here every every morning."
"14094690","14096430"," And then we run it up at the end of the day."
"14096530","14097750"," Then we sell it at the end of the day. "
"14097990","14099330"," Critical to me and who I am."
"14099630","14107010"," Or you can sell it and you buy yourself another really dirty strangle or straddle."
"14107850","14110530"," And you let one side print into the next day. "
"14112070","14113150"," Life and work."
"14113650","14117970"," How do you manage keeping like that balance of keeping your head down."
"14118670","14120410"," To answer the question earlier someone asked. "
"14121070","14125490"," Will I leave the stream up today I will leave it up from three to four p.m. I just"
"14125490","14128510"," have to get ready so what I'll do is I'll leave the stream up I'll start getting ready."
"14129210","14132270"," And then I'll come back to the stream be like hey have a great day and I'll see you guys"
"14132270","14132570"," tomorrow."
"14133570","14137550"," I'll see that if I remember I'll try to take some pictures of this stuff because it gets kind of"
"14137550","14137790"," wild. "
"14137790","14142070"," Is that different jobs are really different in terms of what the expectations are."
"14142930","14146750"," And so I am long put or short this market if you're selling."
"14146950","14152150"," And you join in the organization or even if you've been in the organization for a while but you"
"14152150","14153690"," perhaps move into a different world. "
"14153690","14155470"," Still not seeing anything with Trump right now."
"14155990","14160350"," I see some pictures of or some video of some police and stuff."
"14160610","14162970"," Need to be there when it's it's nice to be there. "
"14164350","14164750"," Thanks."
"14164950","14165550"," I appreciate it."
"14166410","14167650"," I stay sober. "
"14168170","14169830"," I've got my wife and my children with me."
"14170270","14171510"," I'll usually have like a beer or two."
"14171650","14174350"," The one thing I'm afraid of is I was just telling a buddy I was like. "
"14174570","14179590"," I was like I can't eat any bad food this week because I've got two events this week."
"14179750","14183030"," I've got the football match today."
"14183570","14185590"," I think there's another football match this weekend. "
"14186050","14190390"," Could be wrong on that but I think there is but then I've got a bunch of opening day tickets."
"14190970","14196390"," Thursday night I've got opening night tickets for Red Sox Tigers and then Sunday."
"14196650","14202110"," I've got a family game for Red Sox Tigers with the kid with the kiddos. "
"14203790","14205870"," So I tend to not think about."
"14206210","14207870"," You required a good night kiss."
"14210790","14213470"," Oh yeah, I got to start getting my pump on for the day. "
"14213550","14213910"," Don't I?"
"14214450","14216150"," I should probably start doing that now."
"14217450","14223070"," So if there's a period where you're spending more time on family or on yourself but it's health"
"14223070","14225330"," reasons or whatever it is."
"14225350","14227730"," I mean watch fucking Trump just pump this shit up. "
"14227870","14229170"," You can spend more time."
"14230050","14231430"," Let me fucking rocket ship."
"14232590","14234750"," You know we try to map that out again. "
"14234950","14237230"," Yes I am a fan of a bit of a care."
"14237750","14242970"," But taking a bit of a longer horizon people will remember that you were really engaged when you"
"14242970","14243390"," were working."
"14243390","14244430"," Never hurt anybody. "
"14244450","14245790"," A little bit of put put this action."
"14249330","14250570"," Yeah I agree with you Aaron."
"14250710","14252210"," I want the fucking pullback man. "
"14252490","14253390"," I don't want to do this."
"14253670","14254750"," I'll be honest with you."
"14255470","14260270"," I don't mind trading the melt up but it sucks so bad trading it. "
"14261070","14262690"," It's a pain in the ass to trade."
"14262950","14265930"," But it is a challenge and those are days."
"14266690","14271470"," Those are years in my life that I look back on with a lot of fondness. "
"14281750","14283470"," I'm not leaving you just yet."
"14285430","14288130"," I love the market under Trump."
"14288850","14290330"," I did love it under Trump. "
"14290950","14293830"," I didn't love Trump but I love the market under him."
"14294310","14297190"," I didn't love Trump but as a bull."
"14298650","14299930"," That shit was stupid. "
"14300970","14301450"," I'm not leaving you just yet."
"14301450","14309510"," that's it was that's it that was a money grab that was like a highway robbery no doubt about it"
"14309510","14318470"," I mean could you imagine being like could"
"14318470","14324890"," you imagine just being like I'm short the market because Trump was on TV you fucking work you're"
"14324890","14335890"," not even working at Wendy's you're just homeless that shit was insane it"
"14335890","14345590"," was pure insanity yeah it was it was insane I mean you're talking"
"14345590","14353570"," like well it was stress-inducing to I mean if you took a long overnight you'd be down like four"
"14353570","14359510"," percent overnight it would come roaring back by the opening bell and you'd be like can you see that"
"14359510","14367930"," I don't know if you guys don't know about this stuff the stress was fucking pure insanity if you're"

"17417500","17422220"," here and the trade goes against you we start squeezing up you have to take a long here right to"
"17422220","17428520"," cover or close and take a long to go higher but this sets up some weird shit right if you're"
"17428520","17435820"," a bull here if you're a bull here and you're taking this trade here i assure you that by morning"
"17435820","17439800"," if we trade up here those sellers are going to come right back in and trade us right back down"
"17439800","17445740"," i assure you of it it's going to until the daily trigger comes up until the daily trigger comes up"
"17445740","17453100"," it's just going to be a matter of selling you and selling you and selling you now until some time"
"17453100","17459840"," passes so what's the trade here for you for the next few days or at least into tomorrow even into"
"17459840","17469760"," this close uh as a bull i'd be hoping for and what i think's going to happen is um"
"17469760","17476280"," well i don't like the idea that there's still a bunch of four tens if we trade this up though"
"17476280","17481160"," i'd be looking to take another put for tomorrow down here so into the i know four o'clock hour"
"17481160","17488000"," you see a squeeze up i'd be looking to short up here guaranteed we don't have enough velocity to"
"17488000","17497980"," get up there right now it's going to take work to get up there and until that happens"
"17497980","17503660"," the smart moneys down here believe it or not this is what a smart money is they don't care uh"
"17503660","17513000"," so uh i'm selling four ten twenty four four twelve four ten four twelve somewhere in there i don't"
"17513000","17517660"," like the idea that there's all these fucking puts uh i don't think they're going to close the money"
"17517660","17526340"," so i think we squeeze higher and it's chance for uh shorts to reset uh for tomorrow i don't see"
"17526340","17534340"," the bloodbath down to s3 maybe uh some probability that happened just not a high probability that"
"17534340","17541780"," happened the more in the money the puts count the better the chances are of us bloodbath in it down"
"17544640","17551000"," so i look for a relief rally at some points in turn of today between three and four and then"
"17551000","17556740"," uh hopefully we can see more in the money uh puts be bought for so we can we can actually"
"17556740","17561700"," go lower not in the money out of the money puts uh get get bought for us to actually go"
"17561700","17569800"," lower personally that's what i'm hoping for some kind of relief rally in here place to reset uh"
"17569800","17578110"," shorts but i warn you they're there they're right fucking there i guarantee it uh and i really want"
"17578110","17584840"," to buy that i really like to buy that 400 down below so that's my take right now at least"
"17584840","17596220"," at the moment i'm flat right here i'm going to assume where the ball is on the court i"
"17596220","17601460"," don't even assume i already know it but where the ball is right now if you're a bull where the"
"17601460","17610520"," ball is right now it's in the bear's court they're going to sell 410 they're going to sell 412 on"
"17610520","17617120"," you they're going to do it until they get down to 400 of that daily trigger comes up so where"
"17617120","17623180"," you're trying to buy dips in my view probably trying to sell uh any any kind of any kind of"
"17623180","17631600"," resistance we come into above at 410 412 well that's the"
"17631600","17638920"," one earlier what you can end up seeing is that melt and you just we melt up every day and"

"18704250","18709550"," that we think that as long as there's wiggle room available to the fed because of the job market"
"18709550","18714650"," because of the structural deficiencies of labor that they're going to continue to take on that so"

"18757610","18764690"," positive on the outlook for 2024 and we think the price entry point right now is positive look what"
"18764690","18769830"," we are fighting through today is we are still absorbing with the 40 percent increase to the money"
"18769830","18775070"," supply yes we have this sharp down turn and m2 but those two have to even each other out yet"
"18775070","18780390"," and we have this expectation that the fed does take us higher as long as the jobs market allows us"

"18863990","18872310"," to stay away from those or or go into those at this particular time at this particular time that's"
"18872310","18876790"," a million dollar question i would say though that you know our firm's perspective is that this is"
"18876790","18882490"," an entry point on both ends of the of the barbell to your point exactly which is we have to"
"18882490","18886730"," remain agnostic to the direction that we go and up to this point we are believing in the"
"18886730","18891910"," transparency that the Fed is giving us that they are managing to a two percent target that we"
"18891910","18898170"," should be expected of additional rate hikes in the future that they're not done yet and with that"
"18898170","18904830"," you know we we couple it with the strength and resilience we're seeing in other data pockets and we"
"18904830","18911610"," believe that this is an opportunity for us again more opportunity in 2024 so anesthesia are we in"
"18911610","18917610"," an environment where bad news is now bad news right because you know exactly where i'm going with"
"18917610","18923510"," that it was flipped for a while all based on what everything would mean for what the Fed does today"
"18923510","18929710"," is as i said a reminder that look the economy appears to be slowing today is a reminder of that"
"18929710","18935850"," is it a one-day blip is bad news bad news again i mean i think it is a one "
"18935850","18940990","-day story for now i mean the economy is already slowed i mean it's got if you look at manufacturing"
"18940990","18946790"," numbers for example we have already been well below 50 for a period of time so you know if we"
"18946790","18951110"," kind of tread water around here that's not all that bad and again the economy has slowed it was"
"18951110","18956810"," expecting to go into recession and it's not so actually bad news just means that GDP is growing"
"18956810","18962490"," below potential while inflation is slowing that's not actually bad news for the Fed so i guess i"
"18962490","18965710"," wouldn't kind of misinterpret and read into one data point just today."
"18966410","18972010"," Fed perspective if you go deeper into the march meeting it appears that their expectation is for"
"18972010","18976870"," negative growth in the back half of this year simply if you look a little bit beyond kind of where"
"18976870","18982630"," they expected GDP numbers to be for the year given what we expect for Q1 starts to really lead to"
"18982630","18988570"," a narrative for negative GDP in the second half which plays again into this plot line for we"
"18988570","18990270"," believe they take us a bit further yet. "
"18990370","18993230"," You know what i'm wondering and i'd like both of you to answer this question if i'll i begin with"
"18993230","18998710"," you what's priced in how do you think's priced in up to the market which you know went from"
"18998710","19004090"," recession to okay well maybe it's going to be a soft to no landing you heard that narrative being"
"19004090","19012190"," put forward now after the bank issue it's back to are we going into a recession and maybe now"
"19012190","19016810"," that's pulled forward stock market not necessarily reflecting that from the beginning of the year"
"19016810","19017850"," so what is priced in."
"19018510","19023690"," Conversationally with clients what we continue to tell them about Q1 being priced in is a lot of"
"19023690","19032530"," concentration so again focused on the growth and technology run up and at this point you know the"
"19032530","19037810"," expectation what is being priced in is cuts on the back half of this year and the expectation that"
"19037810","19044490"," the worst of it is behind us meaning that the October lows we hit we likely won't retest again and"
"19044490","19049690"," when we get anywhere close to that we see a buy back up in the market and so what's priced"
"19049690","19054530"," in is that the worst of it is a bit behind us and that this expectation that the Fed has"
"19054530","19056710"," to pivot near the end of this year."
"19057490","19061650"," I think what's priced in depends on where you look in the market and if I look to rates then"
"19061650","19066150"," what's priced in is a significant economic slowdown that the Fed is going to have to react to"
"19066150","19070870"," that's not our base case and one place that I would look to sort of capitalize on this this"
"19070870","19076110"," location is energy energy has suffered but it's now going to be moving the oil market is going to"
"19076110","19081750"," be moving from a surplus into a deficit especially with the recent cut so I actually think what's"
"19081750","19086870"," priced in is dislocated is energy because mobility around the world is just starting to pick up. "
"19087230","19094270"," Okay ladies thank you so much that's Anastasia Amoroso and Nicole Webb joining us here at post nine"
"19094270","19099990"," we still as you can see on the right hand side of your screen here are awaiting a former president"
"19099990","19106750"," Trump to emerge from the courtroom where he is currently being arraigned 34th counts we now know"
"19106750","19112890"," related to the falsifying of business records he has pled not guilty we saw a still photo from"
"19112890","19118270"," inside the courtroom as live cameras are not allowed in we just have this one in the hallway here"
"19118270","19123850"," in the meantime I'd like to go to Ayman Jabers who's down in Washington DC for us thinking about"
"19123850","19127910"," all of this how it might be playing in the nation's capital and what may happen now Ayman."
"19128230","19132510"," Scott well we do have a little bit of additional information to bring you right now we can tell you"
"19132510","19138530"," that all 34 counts here are felony counts it was a little unclear in the initial reporting whether"
"19138530","19144490"," all of these were felony counts we are now told from an NBC producer on site in the courtroom that"
"19144490","19150430"," that is the case all are felony counts so we'll wait and see as we're looking at these live images"
"19150430","19157710"," now from inside the courthouse when the former president is removed from that hearing room and"
"19157710","19162670"," makes his way back out to his motorcade to head back down to Florida he's been in there for just"
"19162670","19169390"," over 45 minutes now we were told initially that this process could be relatively quick just a"
"19169390","19173930"," matter of minutes so we would expect this maybe not to go even a full hour but we'll wait and"
"19173930","19179850"," see it all of this is unprecedented there are security concerns there's a robust legal team on both"
"19179850","19184630"," sides here you can imagine everybody will want to have the opportunity to say there are peace"
"19184630","19188530"," inside the courtroom and we'll find out about all of it when they emerge from there but we're"
"19188530","19194270"," monitoring that for you Scott but we can tell you that as of right now all 34 counts are felony"
"19194270","19199210"," counts Scott back over to you back to you certainly as necessary it's been a bit of a spectacle"
"19199210","19205230"," couple handful handfuls of blocks from the New York Stock Exchange today outside that courthouse"
"19205230","19212530"," where our Contessa Brewer has been since early this morning now Contessa you await former President"
"19212530","19221430"," Trump's departure just give us an idea of what the scene is like now you're talking about reporters"
"19221430","19227230"," and photographers from all around the world who've crammed into as you said just a couple of city"
"19227230","19233870"," blocks so you're dealing with that and then Scott hundreds maybe thousands of protesters it's hard"
"19233870","19238110"," for me to judge from my vantage point how many people are actually actually out here but they have"
"19238110","19246270"," filled the entire about a city square block across from the courthouse some Trump supporters some"
"19246270","19252130"," who insist that the former president needs to be held accountable for the accusations that have"
"19252130","19258150"," been leveled against him and then outside here you're seeing an immense police presence we have"
"19258150","19264690"," choppers overhead barricades that are lining the sidewalks and blocking crosswalks and blocking off"
"19264690","19270510"," streets all around this courthouse so what we anticipate is when the hearing is all said and done"
"19270510","19276530"," and the former president leaves the courthouse he will come out of side entrance get back into his"
"19276530","19282130"," convoy again and his ultimate destination is even though New York City has been his home for so"
"19282130","19288810"," many decades he now considers his point of reference Florida so he'll head back down to Mar-a-Lago"
"19288810","19294690"," and has scheduled a news conference there reportedly with friends by his side one of them Marjorie"
"19294690","19300870"," Taylor Greene who we saw show up at this park earlier today but it was such a crush that she"
"19300870","19304970"," came she spoke a few words and then she left even though she had really been promoting that on"
"19304970","19310710"," social media we also saw the Long Island Congressman George Santos here as well and then for him to"
"19310710","19315590"," escape he was actually scoring through the shrubbery to get out of here so again you have a lot of"
"19315590","19321030"," people who've been here for hours waiting for any potential glimpse of the former president though"
"19321030","19326550"," they didn't get it and then now again waiting to see whether he'll come out whether he'll address"
"19326550","19332510"," reporters as well in that hallway that we saw a little bit earlier and as the airman laid out we're"
"19332510","19338150"," still waiting on news of the indictment itself we know that there were 34 felonies for falsifying"
"19338150","19343390"," business records and for conspiracy as well but we'll continue to wait and watch this scene down"
"19343390","19347870"," here as you said just blocks from where you are yeah and i'm going to come back to you at"
"19347870","19353690"," some point in this process too so stand by for me Contessa Brewer who is just outside the criminal"
"19353690","19359850"," courthouse in Lower Manhattan where she's been all day long covering this historic proceeding today"
"19359850","19364670"," involving the former president of the United States in the meantime as we continue to watch the"
"19364670","19371230"," markets we do have about 40 minutes to go before we do close trading out today don't fight the Fed"
"19371230","19376730"," which probably isn't finished raising rates that is the word from our next guest Gary Kaminsky is"
"19376730","19382570"," the chairman of magnify plus the former Morgan Stanley wealth management vice chairman as well he"
"19382570","19385890"," is back with me at post nights good to see again good to see you what did they to be"
"19385890","19392710"," downtown i'll tell you what um so you describe yourself as cautious broadly but not bearish what"
"19392710","19396890"," does that mean well i think what the first quarter showed you Scott is that if you are an investor"
"19396890","19402990"," you have to be invested and i was surprised with the averages averages obviously was skewed by a"
"19402990","19408890"," couple of big stocks but this is the time where don't fight the Fed is not some cliche that is"
"19408890","19414270"," not known by by almost all investors but with raising rates the Fed is going to continue to raise"
"19414270","19418910"," rates and now is a time not to speculate at what he's but to make certain that you know what"
"19418910","19424570"," you own the markets have always operated in cycles i've seen it for close to 40 years now that's"
"19424570","19428690"," where we are but you know as well as anybody in the you know the markets that you've watched over"
"19428690","19435510"," those four decades you don't fight the Fed forever and the Fed is certainly closer to the end than"
"19435510","19440470"," the beginning so at what point do we start to think over the rainbow so to speak when they're done"
"19440470","19445470"," well again i've listened to many people talk about it over the last six months and the real simple"
"19445470","19451290"," answer is nobody knows um my personal opinion is i think the Fed is going to overshoot this time uh"
"19451290","19455930"," they got it wrong with inflation it wasn't transitory and i think that their belief now is to"
"19455930","19462750"," overshoot so in that case is it six months before the end of the heightening cycle six months you"
"19462750","19467730"," think that long no i don't know when the market starts to look forward i have no idea when i"
"19467730","19472830"," listen to people prognostic hate about a pause and then now you've got to be fully invested in"
"19472830","19478890"," invested on that basis i don't think anyone knows the real answer what i do you have to have an"
"19478890","19483630"," opinion on interest rates probably the most single important factors it is with equity investors do"
"19483630","19488630"," they have they peaked i do not believe they peaked i think i think the Fed is determined to"
"19488630","19493110"," overshoot the cycle and i would not be surprised personally you see a six percent terminal rate"
"19493110","19499670"," really you think they would go that high even after what we witnessed with svb and what is still"
"19499670","19505830"," expected to be credit tightening well that's what they want you know they don't want the whole"
"19505830","19511330"," system to blow up but that's why there was a backstop put in place to sort of mitigate what"
"19511330","19516990"," happened with svb i do not think that this is the end of i don't call it a banking crisis"
"19516990","19521510"," i don't believe this is the end of what we saw a couple of weeks back i think you've got"
"19521510","19526790"," this duration mismatch at a number of banks uh given what has happened in terms of funding and in"
"19526790","19534290"," terms of uh assets so that is something that the Fed is not upset that this will have an impact"
"19534290","19539510"," in credit tightening at the end of the day raising interest rates that's what that's about you"
"19539510","19544290"," agree with diamond then right Jamie diamond jpm in his annual shareholder letter as i write this"
"19544290","19548990"," letter the current crisis is not yet over and even when it is behind us there will be repercussions"
"19548990","19556350"," from it for years to come i would agree i think that the way assets are moving to the big"
"19556350","19563310"," banks will have ramifications in terms of the ability for smaller businesses to get credit i think"
"19563310","19568770"," that's what Jamie's talking about in that letter um i don't think it's a crisis i think this is the"
"19568770","19574090"," type of movement that happens when interest rates are going up interest rates go up for a reason"
"19574090","19579630"," and this is exactly what the federal reserve is trying to do in terms of slowing down the economy"
"19579630","19586790"," because inflation is what the target market is would would you own the banks here well those kind"
"19586790","19591150"," of stocks that i would own in this part of the cycle are companies that pay dividends and"
"19591150","19596550"," distributions and reinvest those dividends and distributions in their own businesses when they're"
"19596550","19601070"," not paying it out to shareholders because we are in the time of the cycle you know i've never lost"
"19601070","19606650"," fact of of of the fact that depending on when you're starting point is 40 to 60 percent of the"
"19606650","19611170"," return of equities over the long term the 10 percent number that's thrown out there all the time"
"19611170","19616650"," half of that is dividends and distributions reinvested it's not capital appreciation it's not"
"19616650","19620790"," talked about that much but you're in the part of the cycle now with the equity markets where"
"19620790","19626850"," companies that pay you dividends and distributions is much more importantly capital appreciation"
"19626850","19632250"," i'm listening to you as i continue to watch these pictures which is why i'm looking away as we wait"
"19632250","19636390"," for the former president to emerge from the courtroom after the arraignment we're going to deal"
"19636390","19643650"," with that as as it sees fit certainly magnify i mentioned in the introduction what you're doing now"
"19643650","19650550"," this is like a financial search engine for investors when you talk about different parts of the"
"19650550","19655910"," market this is a way that they as i understand it search to be able to invest in different"
"19655910","19661690"," securities and or asset classes yeah so magnify has been called the google of finance for whatever"
"19661690","19666710"," reason if you go into google and you type in something about an investment product it's not going"
"19666710","19673450"," to direct you to exactly how you invest the magnify language which was created by tiffin which is"
"19673450","19678630"," an incubator of fintech companies i was an investor i joined the board three years ago and now i'm"
"19678630","19684290"," helping run one of the businesses if i had watched your interview with the fish yesterday and he"
"19684290","19689070"," talked about natural gas and why you would want to get long a natural gas at this point in the"
"19689070","19694490"," investment cycle but you didn't know exactly how to do it you could go to magnify you could type in"
"19694490","19700590"," using natural language search i want to invest in natural gas long what magnify does it will give"
"19700590","19706950"," you ETFs mutual funds you can sort it based on performance it does so it does it by performance by"
"19706950","19713590"," fees so it's not just giving you random ideas hey go buy xyz exactly you are able to go into"
"19713590","19719930"," the search bar and what it does comparing it to let's say decades ago this information was not"
"19719930","19725350"," readily available to individual investors or professional wealth managers you know in the old days"
"19725350","19731450"," if a wealth manager had a client who wanted to invest in a certain sector ETF space in the"
"19731450","19735370"," marketplace they'd have to deal with a product specialist they'd have to deal with a wholesaler"
"19735370","19741850"," this information is now readily available at just basically going into your laptop and typing it in"
"19741850","19747450"," and so what we've tried to do is democratize this information for the general public i'm going to"
"19747450","19751570"," stop you from speaking gary because the former president trump has just emerged from the courtroom"
"19751570","19757590"," where he was arraigned he is now on his way towards exiting that courthouse in lowerman hat and"

"19763890","19769590"," records the former president trump pleading not guilty in that courtroom and what really is a"
"19769590","19776390"," historic moment for this country we think that the former president is going to head back to palm"
"19776390","19781390"," beach where he will hold an event a little bit later on this evening them in hat and district"
"19781390","19787410"," attorney who brought these charges in the first place with the grand jury is holding a news event"

"19804450","19809630"," emerge but we've now seen him leave scott and as you say he was in the hearing room for just"
"19809630","19814950"," under an hour by my clock that's a little bit longer than we were told to expect these proceedings"
"19814950","19821170"," can sometimes move quicker than that even but obviously given the security concerns the need to"
"19821170","19826410"," coordinate transportation and all the rest uh this is a more cumbersome process than we've seen"
"19826410","19831890"," maybe ever in that hearing room we're watching the exterior now as we wait for the former president"
"19831890","19837330"," to leave i can see Boris Epstein the political aid there to the former president of the united"
"19837330","19843430"," states standing by waiting for Donald trump to leave we still do not have the actual indictment"

"19888050","19896070"," of those vehicles uh in that caravan that's going to head as amen thanks to the airport the real"
"19896070","19900970"," question that we've had scott is whether the former president would take a moment and try to speak"
"19900970","19907210"," with reporters in that hallway outside of court it may have been that the barriers that were set up"
"19907210","19912510"," inside that corridor kept reporters and photographers separated from the path the former president"
"19912510","19918410"," was taking uh but again when he walked outside we did not see him uh doing any sort of big"
"19918410","19924590"," triumphed wave to anyone outside of there this is all happening just around the corner and i'll"
