"_5SdcLHTzXQ","181640","182200"," Good morning."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","182200","183200"," I should have said that, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","183200","184440"," I said a fuck in the first minute."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","184440","186600"," I'm going to get demonetized if I am demonetized."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","186600","189040"," I'm going to delete that beep."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","202000","206080"," Shint took James, Dejan, Chase, good morning, Michael."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","206080","208360"," Danny, we have some time here this morning."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","208360","210520"," So we'll just take it easy here for a minute."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","210520","212320"," We'll switch right over so you can see stuff."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","212320","213840"," What's going on?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","213840","215280"," T-Crown, good morning."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","215280","217920"," Jasmine, Kalo, Scott, Ryan, Ignatio."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","217920","220160"," Holy shit, people are showing up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","220160","223520"," James Buchanan, the King cows here, Matthew."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","223520","225240"," Ali Baba, good to see you."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","228560","231520"," Hey, GM, good morning, Everton."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","231520","234080"," All right, we'll talk about Tesla today, too."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","234080","236320"," So this is a big market day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","236320","237560"," This is the S&P 500 day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","237560","239640"," This is the NASDAQ day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","239640","241480"," This is all your individual ticker day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","241480","244120"," Backward-day, Shen, the VIX day, too, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","244120","248160"," VIX bulls are just cursing this morning."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","248160","248640"," I bet."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","248640","250480"," I think."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","250480","251880"," So we'll switch right over right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","251880","255760"," We're going to go to the live stream here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","255760","259040"," Let me put me post this to Twitter real quick."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","259040","265160"," The, oh, hold on, let me just need this here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","265160","267160"," Am I in 1080p this morning?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","267160","270440"," My fucking street, so I shouldn't be swearing."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","270440","271320"," I'm not."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","271320","273280"," Again, I'm not in 1080p."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","273280","276360"," Whatever, we'll let it slide one more day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","276360","278000"," But we'll share this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","278000","279880"," I'm so pissed off."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","279880","283480"," It's like streamlabs need to get a shock on PayPal."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","283600","286120"," I got a funny story for it before you get started this morning."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","286120","292560"," I'll repeat this later, but I won my fight with PayPal,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","292560","293640"," which I'm pretty happy with."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","296880","300520"," I had a PayPal saga going on."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","300520","303840"," And I beat my case with PayPal, which is awesome."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","303840","309080"," But still, I'm not on the fence if I stay with PayPal or not."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","309080","310680"," But PayPal, man, they're bad."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","310680","313360"," Like PayPal, at any moment, they can just come right in"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","313360","316920"," and be like, we're going to seize everything you have."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","316920","319000"," Really fucked up situation."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","323600","326240"," It's really fucked up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","326240","327200"," So it's weird."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","327200","328880"," I started refunding people."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","328880","332080"," And then I have to go through some names later"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","332080","333080"," to who got refunded."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","333080","343480"," We'll go through the whole one here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","343480","349560"," It's kind of crazy, so they didn't release all my money"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","349560","353720"," and told me everything was fine, whatever."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","353720","355720"," We'll talk about that in another time."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","355720","357720"," So if you donate, you can donate to PayPal again."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","357720","361080"," There's a little description in the little box down below."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","361960","364400"," Now, with all that said, turn the old shit off."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","364400","367440"," We're going to get right into it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","367440","368800"," So you see this little bump down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","368800","369520"," We need to see this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","369520","370640"," Before we even get anything else,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","370640","371680"," we'll end up talking about stuff."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","371680","374320"," But see down here, this is 4.14 here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","374320","376000"," Little bit of support down here, 4.13."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","376000","381600"," Then this weird wonky duck, kind of a thing down here, 4.12."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","381600","387400"," To be aware of that, I'm going to expect some grind down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","387400","389400"," You can possibly buy some spreads here right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","391960","394480"," Better price is probably down to 4.12."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","394480","396760"," And there's nothing saying we can't trade lower."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","396760","398240"," Now, just looking at this right here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","398240","400160"," This support, you can see that this support"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","400160","402000"," has moved up here to 4.12."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","402000","405600"," It's kind of a weird day with support levels."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","405600","407480"," Now, if we get some bad news, we'll talk about bad news,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","407480","410320"," good news, and how far down we can sell."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","410320","413280"," It is really weird down here too, 4.08."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","413280","415680"," Lots of interest down there, 4.08."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","415680","419720"," Lots of interest down here at 4.04, not quite 4.05."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","419720","425640"," So I think the implication behind this is in even 3.98."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","425640","428120"," And the reason I'm going to point this out to you right"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","428120","430280"," off the bat this morning is that there's"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","430280","433000"," some implication that if we trade down levels,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","433000","435440"," there's going to be some spikes from volatility."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","435440","438840"," You might see a spike down to 4.08 instead of 4.10."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","438840","441880"," You might see a spike down to 4.12 instead of 4.15."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","441880","444600"," You know, repetitively down the list there to 4.05."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","444600","448040"," It might be 4.04, 400 might be 3.98."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","448040","451680"," Depending on how the news comes out today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","451680","453560"," So we'll get into that this morning."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","453560","456200"," I'll leave this up for you on the screen."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","456200","458640"," Or we'll bounce around this morning."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","458640","460680"," And we're going to talk for the next hour."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","460680","464040"," So if you're out there, you're a trader and investor, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","464040","467280"," This is not the time to be fucking around the market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","467280","471800"," Yesterday, I didn't want to come on livestream yesterday"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","471800","475240"," because there's a lot of, no, it's not fuckery."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","475240","478880"," It's a lot of lock it in bulls, lock it in bears."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","478880","481160"," There's some money we made in there yesterday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","481160","484080"," Here's a beautiful run up on the open yesterday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","484080","485320"," Couple of dips to buy yesterday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","485320","488720"," Couple of sell signals yesterday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","488720","491800"," But none of them really panned out even the sell yesterday"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","491800","494720"," that should have sold the market down with that fake Twitter"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","494720","498480"," report that we were getting 75 VPS."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","498480","501400"," Even that report should have sold the market down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","501400","502920"," And of course, it didn't, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","503280","505800"," We got a hair trigger alarm to sell the market violently"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","505800","507080"," and it bounced right back."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","507080","510760"," Under normal circumstances, that would have sold off"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","510760","512320"," even with a fake report."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","512320","515760"," The reason it didn't, it bounces because of the,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","515760","518440"," because of the options market, basically."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","518440","519680"," And of course, the hair trigger."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","519680","523280"," But the options market is stopping that trade"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","523280","525000"," and continuing going, any normal day of that shit"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","525000","528000"," would have sold off yesterday without a doubt."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","528000","530280"," So whatever, with all that stuff set aside,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","530280","532200"," let's talk about some stuff here, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","533160","535760"," So we're kind of hanging out in No Man's Land here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","537200","539200"," And that's really not the place to be buying a dip"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","539200","540280"," even here, here, here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","540280","542320"," You could possibly buy a spread here,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","542320","543960"," but this is No Man's Land, believe it or not."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","543960","547640"," 412 down here, and it says 412.46."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","547640","550160"," It needs to say just 412 flat, I think."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","551320","553640"," So we'll take a look at, we'll take a look down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","554600","555880"," We're gonna make this 412 flat."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","557280","560520"," We got a 411 down, our 404.110."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","561520","564720"," A little bit cleaner, something like that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","564720","565960"," And we're gonna go on a five day chart"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","565960","569120"," and just show you the volatility that's expected today"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","569120","571320"," is huge."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","571320","574760"," The implied move today is huge."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","574760","576200"," So this is noise right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","576200","577200"," This means nothing."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","577200","579400"," This little move down is absolutely nothing."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","579400","581920"," I was hoping that some of you would have thought about this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","583360","586120"," What I thought about this chart that I posted today"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","586120","587920"," and how wide it was."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","590760","592720"," Now, this R2 above here,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","592720","594520"," we'll talk about this this morning."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","594520","596880"," We probably won't reach this R2"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","598240","600600"," if we do reach it until Friday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","600600","601720"," So anything you buy today,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","601720","603000"," if you're gonna be very aggressive"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","603000","604400"," and you're like, I'm buying zero dates today,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","604400","606080"," Cap, I don't give a shit or yeah,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","606080","608240"," zero dates day, I don't give a shit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","608240","612280"," Do not buy anything, no matter where we are today"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","612280","617120"," at 130, at two o'clock, 230, nothing over 420."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","618600","620240"," Nothing in zero dates."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","620960","623320"," Okay, so if you're even considering zero dates today,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","623320","625640"," do not buy anything over 420."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","625640","630640"," Now, personally, I'll probably be buying some Friday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","631840","633760"," I probably won't be buying zero dates today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","633760","637320"," Probably be buying some Friday 430s."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","637320","640960"," I posted that for you on the ad captain's offer"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","640960","642440"," this morning to keep your eyes"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","643920","646720"," on the 430 C's expiring on Friday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","646720","647960"," At the time that I posted that,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","647960","651640"," it was at like 80 something cents, 89 cents or something."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","651640","653600"," And they're now down to 56 cents."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","653600","655280"," They're half price almost."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","655280","658200"," And I give a price target of like 30 cents."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","658200","659400"," So we're not quite there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","660400","663520"," And I even said you could even roll into them at 60 cents,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","663520","664480"," start adding on them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","665960","670120"," You could buy like, I don't know, a rack or so at 60 or 50"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","670120","672760"," or 40 or 30 as we head down there"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","672760","674400"," and dollar cost average into them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","675760","677760"," Personally, I wanna pay 30 cents for them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","678960","679800"," Somewhere in there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","679800","682200"," That should print like 1000% by the way."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","684200","687040"," Now, with that said, if it takes us till Friday"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","688880","691520"," to get to 430, even those Friday calls"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","691520","693760"," might start losing value on Thursday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","693760","696000"," So you're gonna have to manage those calls."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","696000","697560"," It depends if we get the,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","697560","698960"," if you get the trade up to 420,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","698960","701760"," then if we can get the gap up overnight in futures,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","701760","705720"," if they're not hedging so much anymore,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","705760","708240"," we've got some burn in volatility"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","709840","711800"," for a bid on Thursday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","711800","715320"," I'm really looking to capture a premium kick on it"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","715320","717760"," on those calls and then the implication,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","717760","720440"," the implied move, of course, to 430 on Friday"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","720440","723840"," would should keep some, not intrinsic value,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","723840","727040"," but gamma on those calls."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","727040","729400"," So it's gonna be a tricky play."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","729400","730240"," We'll let it out."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","730240","731400"," Keep your eyes on them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","731400","732360"," They're gonna have to be managed."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","732360","735280"," Anything you buy today is gonna have to be managed."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","735280","737440"," Another note today would be"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","737440","739040"," any kind of crazy moves in the market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","739040","741640"," There's two places we're gonna talk about today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","743280","746920"," Usually in FMC days, you might see a bid before 2PM."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","748440","751160"," So let's say this is 12, let's do it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","751160","753480"," Let's do it like this, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","753480","755160"," We'll do it just like this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","757120","758520"," That's 2PM right there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","765320","768840"," Now you might actually catch a bid before 2PM."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","768840","771760"," You might, we should be weak until 130."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","772760","774840"," But you know, sometimes that shit leaks."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","775760","778560"," When I would trade this, it used to be like 1, 130"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","778560","782480"," and then like the last time I think it was 11.30 in the morning,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","782480","785200"," that shit leaked and it got bought."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","785200","787440"," So anytime from about 11.30 this morning"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","787440","789480"," until about 1.30 this afternoon,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","789480","791360"," there's gonna be a dip to buy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","791360","792720"," Now that dip to buy,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","793720","797720"," the danger in this dip to buy is let's say we wiggle our way down here"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","797720","802720"," to like 11 o'clock, then there's a dip to buy, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","803720","805720"," Let's say you buy that dip, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","805720","808720"," And we start trading up before, believe it or not, before 2PM."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","810720","813720"," I'm not expecting much out of that press release."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","813720","815720"," I think that press release is gonna be neutral."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","815720","820720"," I think that press release is gonna tell you 50 BPS QT."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","821280","823000"," There may be some details in there"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","823000","826520"," that the journalists will look at and it's gonna not be,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","826520","828120"," I think there's gonna be some funny talk in there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","828120","828960"," I think they're gonna,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","828960","830640"," I think they know they have to support the credit markets."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","830640","832760"," I think they know they have to support currencies"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","832760","834280"," and a lot of fucking nonsense."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","837360","840760"," But the presser later at 2.30, that's the one to watch."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","840760","845120"," That's the one where if you get that rip early in the day,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","845120","847480"," you might get a violent sell down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","847480","852480"," 408, 405, believe it or not, it could get that nasty."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","854240","856160"," To make it this like kick ass trade here"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","856160","858000"," and then you might have a second one here"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","858000","860760"," and you might panic sell if this happens."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","860760","863600"," I would advise against that"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","863600","865920"," or reposition yourself at some point."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","865920","869200"," Just be conscious of those two moves"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","869200","871720"," that could take place, you get something like this,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","871720","873960"," something like that and then we go up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","874000","877560"," If it's hawkish, we go down here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","877560","881060"," They will keep it down into the Friday expiry."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","882440","883360"," Be aware of that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","884400","887600"," I would not be placing trades today at any time today"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","887600","891760"," that are nothing other than like 30 cent, 15 cent trades."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","891760","893960"," It wouldn't be down here if I were you"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","893960","895600"," with the risk that's in the market and being like,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","895600","897200"," yeah, I'm gonna buy some fucking calls"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","897200","900080"," that cost two, three dollars or some spreads"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","900080","901280"," that cost two, three dollars."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","901280","902600"," Fuck no."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","902920","905000"," No point in that putting that risk on."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","905000","908360"," Now, if you burn like a total of 30 cents or 60 cents"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","908360","910480"," or something like that and the market sells off,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","910480","912120"," what do you care?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","912120","913200"," You shouldn't care."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","913200","915160"," You shouldn't care if we get hawkish news"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","915160","918680"," and it sells down below 400 and only losing 60 cents."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","918680","923320"," You're only job here is to spend as little as possible"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","923320","925520"," to grab the right dip and so if you spend as little"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","925520","928360"," as possible grabbing the right dip,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","928360","930840"," it doesn't matter if it costs 30 cents that time"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","930920","933600"," or 60 cents or even like 80 cents."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","933600","936880"," If it gets real deep, deep, deep, deep down,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","936880","937720"," it doesn't matter."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","937720","938560"," They're gonna pay."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","939680","942160"," But the key in this trade is that you're looking"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","942160","945440"," for moments of weakness in the market today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","945440","947800"," And this is a moment, we're in a weak moment at this moment,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","947800","949760"," but not quite."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","949760","951800"," This is really not weak."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","951800","952640"," I want my cursors."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","952640","956440"," This is kind of weak and this is kind of weak down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","956440","959400"," This is what I'm waiting for some down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","959400","961240"," To grab some cheap ass calls."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","962680","964600"," And the other key point in this is that you don't want"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","964600","965680"," to grab them too early either."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","965680","968360"," If you grab like a 30 cent call right here,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","968360","971000"," sometimes they'll bleed them down like 15 cents."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","971000","973920"," Seriously, like another 10 or 20 minutes."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","973920","977480"," So we'll manage this and monitor this as the day moves forward."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","979520","981080"," Another thought about today would be"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","981080","983360"," why is Biden coming out at two o'clock?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","983360","984480"," Which is fucking stupid."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","984480","986680"," There's no reason for him to be out there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","986680","989280"," Probably have to delete this video today for swearing."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","989320","992360"," I'm almost sure because my video is being reviewed right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","992360","995440"," I can't be swearing in the first like 10 minutes or 15 minutes."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","995440","996760"," And of course, I did."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","998480","1001840"," So, which is kind of crazy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1005760","1008280"," No, it's so crazy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1008280","1009120"," Whatever."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1009120","1011360"," So the point is this is that"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1015360","1016320"," timing is key."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1016320","1018160"," These are one of those moments where you have"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1018160","1019240"," time things appropriately."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1019240","1020960"," You know you've got Biden coming up to"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1020960","1022720"," that should lend some volatility to the market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1022720","1025800"," But in reality, it's a nothing burger."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1025800","1027680"," The only thing you should be paying attention to"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1027680","1031080"," in that speech from Biden"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1031080","1034080"," is that Biden knew oil was going up today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1034080","1037600"," If Biden brings up at any time, price controls."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1037600","1040440"," If you're an oil and gas, he brings up price controls."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1040440","1045040"," If you're in anything that sells a product"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1045040","1047000"," that there could be price controls on."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1048000","1050200"," Anything crazy priced out there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1051280","1053560"," You could get fucked in that trade."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1053560","1054720"," If you're an oil gas guy and you're like,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1054720","1056160"," fuck that, it's going up cap."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1056160","1059200"," I'm telling you, if I think it's a very small chance,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1059200","1063240"," like 5%, maybe 0.5%, or whatever, not 0.5, that's 50%."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1063240","1066720"," Like 0.005, 0.005%."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1066720","1069000"," But if they brave and whisper that,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1069000","1071200"," you're gonna see weakness probably in the stock market"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1071200","1072520"," and probably in energy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1074640","1076880"," That could impact our economy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1076880","1078640"," Now, I don't want to scare you either"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1078640","1079560"," because I don't think that happens,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1079560","1082200"," but that's your tail risk and that shit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1082200","1086120"," Other than that, the real key to be watching though,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1086120","1088760"," the real key to be watching is the numbers."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1088760","1090240"," Is it 50 BPS or not?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1090240","1092440"," That's gonna be your key to be paying attention to."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1092440","1095800"," Is it 50 BPS and are we getting QT?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1095800","1097680"," And what kind of QT are we getting?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1097680","1100280"," Are we still talking and talking about QT?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1100280","1102280"," Are they talking about QT in a June?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1103320","1104160"," Right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1104160","1105880"," Are they doing QT, QT now?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1106760","1109040"," Are they going to make a decision in June?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1109040","1111080"," Because that's talking about talking about QT."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1111080","1112200"," That's a big one."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1114000","1115640"," And then the last part of that conversation,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1115640","1118920"," and that's the FOMC at two, now 230."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1120360","1122720"," I want you all to be aware of that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1122720","1126280"," If you've noticed, J. Powell has gotten more"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1126280","1130000"," and more hawkish in his statement,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1130000","1132120"," or not the statement, but in his pressers."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1133120","1138120"," And when he does that, it does affect the market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1138120","1140880"," So that could be your second point of weakness today, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1140880","1143440"," And it's crazy because I'll sit there sometimes"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1143440","1147440"," and I'll watch a J. Powell presser and it starts out great."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1147440","1149120"," And then that last reporter gets in there"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1149120","1152120"," like 20 minutes, half hour later."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1152120","1154640"," And you're thinking everything's great, we're going up"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1154640","1157360"," and boom, they drop a bomb question."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1157360","1159720"," And he goes off in a tangent, not a tangent,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1159720","1161120"," but he goes off in a,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1161120","1164680"," I'm in charge of the economy, I'm going to raise 75 BPS next."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1164680","1166240"," All that kind of nonsense."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1166240","1168760"," And the market fucking craters one more time."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1168760","1170760"," So it's high volatility, there's more,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1170760","1173160"," or at least two chances today for the market"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1173160","1174840"," to crater at some point."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1174840","1175840"," You have to be aware of that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1175840","1177480"," You can't be in there buying calls"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1177480","1180160"," and being like, hey, Cap, why don't you tell me"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1181480","1183400"," that it's going to reverse like that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1185080","1188960"," Another risk today, this one's real though."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1188960","1193360"," If he comes out and he says, we're at 25 BPS."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1195040","1198360"," We're no rate increases, we're going to just monitor."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1198360","1200600"," Because I'll tell you what, that gas coming out today,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1200600","1203760"," that gas price coming out today could be him."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1203760","1206160"," Believe it or not, get put now at 25 BPS."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1206160","1208440"," Comments from President Biden just reiterating"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1208440","1210840"," and emphasizing that the United States remains,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1210840","1213840"," will always remain open to additional sanctions on Russia."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1214800","1215640"," Tell you what those guys are."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1215640","1217520"," And he tends to talk to G7 leaders"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1217560","1219560"," about potential further actions."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1221920","1225560"," There is a slim chance that they could say it's 25 BPS."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1225560","1227680"," We're only adding 25 on to the 50 at this point"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1227680","1228880"," due to gas prices."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1228880","1231000"," He could come out there today and say to you,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1231000","1232840"," we've got worries with Ukraine."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1232840","1234760"," We've got worries with gas prices."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1235720","1236800"," Just like COVID, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1236800","1239640"," We're going to monitor, see how bad it is."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1241560","1243680"," So there is that that could happen today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1243680","1246600"," Now if that happens and they don't do that, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1246600","1249280"," Let's say that they come in more dovish than expected."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1249280","1251400"," You could still see a quick dropdown."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1251400","1253520"," This is a dropdown where a bank wants to,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1253520","1257080"," wants to cut their shorts loose and take it long."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1257080","1260040"," So even if you're like, we're going to get a great bed meeting."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1262960","1266640"," Now another thing, if we get something super bearish,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1268840","1273080"," if we get something super bearish like 75 BPS or Fucked UT,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1273080","1275560"," we're going full tilt, we're going to murder all these,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1275560","1277240"," murder the equities market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1277240","1280360"," Sometimes instead of seeing a drop like this, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1280360","1285360"," Dropdown, believe it or not, you'll end up seeing a spike higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1287880","1290840"," So if you see, if we, if we see something hawkish"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1290840","1294440"," in the statement or in the press release or in the presser,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1294440","1295760"," it is possible."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1295760","1297600"," You could see a swing high, believe it or not."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1297600","1301040"," This is for more shorts to pile in at even better prices."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1301040","1303280"," So be careful with what your interpretation is"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1303440","1309240"," as to flash crashes or quick spikes up, like fast."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1309240","1310880"," They happen so fast."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1310880","1312880"," And it's like a minute or two, three minutes,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1312880","1314840"," four minutes, five minutes max,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1314840","1316520"," and you'll see a quick spike up"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1316520","1317640"," and then we'll start selling it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1317640","1319760"," You see something like this right off?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1319760","1322600"," It has a potential to go real deep down here, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1324960","1326560"," That's a lot to a lot of information, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1326560","1328600"," A lot of stuff to be thinking about,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1328600","1332120"," like a, I don't know, like a basketball player or,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1332120","1333960"," you know, anything you need, a soccer player,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1333960","1336280"," like you need to be quick on your feet today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1336280","1340840"," If this is too much for you today to be thinking about,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1340840","1343880"," then maybe it's just some call spreads down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1343880","1346040"," Does that make sense for you, like?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1346040","1349080"," For about 15 minutes now, the European cash close"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1349080","1351120"," and we're seeing some global equity weakness here,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1351120","1353480"," heading into the European close."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1353480","1355560"," The DAX is now down a third of a percent."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1355560","1357640"," The catcron is down more than 1%."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1357640","1360440"," U.S. equity markets are at the lows of the session,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1360440","1364880"," 41, 47 in the S&P minis, down half a percent."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1364880","1365720"," Hey buddy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1365720","1370720"," The NASDAQ 100 futures are down about 1.5% at 12,896."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1372440","1376720"," The VIX at 29, 29, all changed on the day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1379000","1380760"," So the whole point being is that you can just come down here"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1380760","1382040"," and be like, Cap, I don't want to play that game."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1382040","1383520"," Cap, I don't want to deal with that bullshit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1383520","1384520"," This makes sense, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1384520","1386760"," You just come down here, you grab a dip,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1386760","1390040"," you close your computer and you wait, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1390160","1391600"," Literally, you should show your computer down"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1391600","1394040"," because they're going to tell you all kinds of nastiness."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1395640","1400400"," Euro trading at 105.52 is up 33 pips on the day"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1400400","1403400"," holding near the highs of the day in the Euro."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1403400","1405200"," You need more than likely, even with bad news,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1405200","1408200"," snap back and come back down the road, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1408200","1410400"," So you could put a month on those."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1410400","1412320"," And I'm going to talk about why you put a month on them"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1412320","1413160"," and not Friday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1413160","1416840"," We'll talk about the OPEX for this month for May, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1416840","1418880"," I think it's May 20th, we'll confirm that,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1418880","1420680"," but I think it's May 20th."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1420680","1425560"," But that OPEX has a ton of puts rolling off the board, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1425560","1426880"," May 20th."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1426880","1429440"," So if we have puts rolling off the board on May 20th,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1429440","1430880"," I think I called somebody earlier and said,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1430880","1433720"," get May 20th spreads, make them a week later"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1433720","1435880"," for the day after, the Monday after."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1437880","1439120"," We've got maybe a week after,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1439120","1442640"," one week after the 20th, you would get some call spreads"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1442640","1445400"," because that would give you the last kick"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1445400","1448120"," on a bad FMC to get back above 4,000"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1448120","1450320"," into the 4, 20, 430 range."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1450320","1451800"," You'd have that on your side heading"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1451800","1454560"," into the week after OPEX."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1454560","1458640"," So key that in for, write that down in paper, all right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1459920","1462480"," And we'll look at that for a month out."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1462480","1465120"," And we'll talk about it in more detail here in a minute."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1466320","1468280"," On a negative, we had a bad,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1469360","1471440"," hawkish statement."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1473960","1475760"," There's the 20th right there, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1478320","1481000"," Say, let's say you buy them at 405 or 410, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1481000","1483400"," And you're like, oh, cap, I'm totally fucked down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1483400","1487120"," And you're watching all the assholes on Twitter or whatever."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1487120","1489520"," And they tell you it's gonna burn, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1489520","1491000"," It's gonna come swooping back up here"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1491000","1492640"," and you're gonna get this kick."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1492640","1493560"," I don't think it's gonna be like this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1493560","1495640"," I think it's gonna be more like this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1495640","1496720"," So are something like that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1496720","1498920"," I think that's what it's gonna be, but,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1498920","1502640"," maybe something like this and then slam down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1502640","1505120"," That would be with a believe it or with a hawkish bed."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1505120","1507360"," And then you're gonna get a slam up over here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1508280","1510360"," So if you get some call spreads in here,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1510360","1511840"," it's gonna look ugly."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1511840","1512680"," And then it's gonna come back"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1512680","1514040"," and actually print you no matter what."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1514040","1515920"," So that's some safety, that's a safety trade for you"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1515920","1518800"," if you don't wanna deal with it in this bullshit today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1518800","1521080"," Here's my price target for May 4th."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1521080","1521920"," I don't think we're getting in."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1521920","1524320"," I don't think we're getting 4,000 a day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1524320","1527080"," I'm off on this trade so far."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1529600","1530960"," So that's my point, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1530960","1531920"," So you can just take it easy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1531920","1535480"," You don't have to deal with the violent moves in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1535480","1537960"," Now, if you do choose, if you're like, fuck that cap,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1538000","1538840"," I'm in."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1540240","1541720"," If you're in, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1541720","1544080"," My recommendation is that you diamond hand,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1544080","1547320"," and if you lose that trade, you diamond hand it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1547320","1548120"," You just burn it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1549200","1551080"," Cause there's always that chance, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1551080","1552720"," In this volatility down here"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1552720","1556600"," that you're gonna see some nastiness that could go like this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1556600","1558160"," And you'll come back in like a day or two"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1558160","1559960"," with a Friday call, Friday outside of my calls,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1559960","1563360"," be like, fuck cap, they went from 30 cents down"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1563360","1565560"," to two cents and then back up to 30 cents."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1565560","1567280"," I could have at least broke even."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1567280","1569160"," Does that make sense to you guys?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1569160","1571920"," Or they went up down to two cents, no, to 15 cents,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1571920","1574120"," and I could have at least saved half my money."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1574120","1576000"," Or I could have rolled into more,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1576000","1578160"," or I could have reset, or, you know,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1578160","1581400"," I saved those, captured the 15 cents on them,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1581400","1584120"," and then actually repositioned for a better trade hire."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1584120","1587120"," So make sure you're managing your trades today, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1587120","1589240"," It's very important that you manage trades."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1589240","1590760"," Very important that you decide on"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1590760","1593800"," what kind of headaches you want the next few days,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1593800","1596160"," and that you don't get too beaten up in the head."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1596520","1597880"," If we sell off, we have a hawker statement,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1597880","1599520"," we burn the whole market down to,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1599520","1601720"," I don't know, 390 or something stupid like that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1601720","1602880"," Stay in the game."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1604400","1605360"," Stay in the game,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1605360","1608480"," because that 390 might have been a place for you to buy"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1608480","1610640"," and save that bad trade that you had above."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1611640","1612960"," It's a big part of trading, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1612960","1614800"," Is if you're losing a trade,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1614800","1616360"," that you were able to save that trade."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1616360","1619880"," Oftentimes, there's at least a year where I traded"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1619880","1624880"," where I would cut something loose only to have it come back."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1624880","1626560"," Or I'd cut something loose,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1626560","1630200"," and my mentality was,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1630200","1632320"," if I could market to burn, I'm totally pissed off here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1632320","1636000"," I'm too scared to take this next bottom."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1636000","1638400"," And if I had just taken that next bottom,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1638400","1640680"," I would have printed stupid multiples of money."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1640680","1644200"," So be tough today, if you're trading this market,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1644200","1646840"," you have to be tough trading this market today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1646840","1649400"," If you can't be tough trading this market today,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1649400","1651920"," you're just placing a spread, closing your shit up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1651920","1654640"," Don't listen to me, just don't listen to Twitter."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1654640","1656840"," Don't listen to Stank Twits, whatever you,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1656840","1659520"," Wall Street Bats, just stay off the internet."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1659520","1661480"," Don't read Bloomberg."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1661480","1663320"," Don't read Forbes."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1663320","1664880"," Staff the internet."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1664880","1668360"," Make your trade, get in your bunker, go away till Prince."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1672680","1673520"," All right, so we're gonna go over"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1673520","1676080"," some more of the other thing this morning."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1676080","1678400"," We're gonna go over, what are we gonna go over here?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1681120","1683560"," So today's note is from the founder."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1683560","1686880"," We actually have the founder's note today from spot gamma."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1686880","1690080"," So we'll do what they're talking about here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1690080","1692680"," Sustained rally is unlikely to occur until 5'4""."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1692680","1694760"," We know that now, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1694760","1697520"," Substantial, longer term support at 4050."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1699920","1702000"," Accepting lower prices in the market, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1702000","1702920"," That's that key, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1702920","1705160"," Futures required over 9 absolutely to 4185."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1705160","1707960"," We expect to come session today up until 2pm."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1707960","1711200"," FMC events, following that, we see key resistance."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1711200","1712080"," Following that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1713080","1717080"," We see key resistance at 420, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1720640","1724960"," With 428 as the next resistance point from our models."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1728040","1732880"," So following FMC, we'll probably only get this today, 420."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1732880","1734520"," So if you're gonna buy zero dates,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1734520","1736720"," that's your fucking price target."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1736720","1740560"," Only thing you need to worry about is where you're buying them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1740640","1744640"," Are you buying them at 414 or are you buying them at 410 or are you buying them at 405?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1745680","1747160"," So key in on that, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1748040","1749120"," Very important."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1751920","1755000"," Support shows at 4125 and 4110."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1755000","1756960"," So basically, spy 410."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1756960","1759320"," As we've noted for some time now,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1759320","1762000"," we're looking for a strong directional move out of the FMC statement."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1762000","1764120"," Yesterday we discussed that the market's reaction"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1764120","1766160"," likely leads to a reduction in event volatility,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1766160","1769400"," assuming Powell doesn't come off as overly hawkish."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1769400","1773400"," This is about when he starts talking, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1773400","1774400"," 230."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1774400","1778600"," I don't know, yes, we also outlined that there's not a large options expiration"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1778600","1779600"," around FMC."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1780600","1785200"," To measure less than 15% of total S&P gamma expiring this week."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1785200","1787600"," Now, total would be today and Friday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1793600","1795600"," Normally we get 20% in a day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1796600","1800600"," So you're talking about two days, less than 20%."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1802600","1805600"," Between today's expiring Fridays, so I didn't read that part yet."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1806600","1809600"," This small expiration reduces the put burn,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1809600","1812600"," and in turn may reduce the velocity of a rally,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1813600","1815600"," or spreads come in, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1815600","1817600"," Even spreads for Friday come in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1817600","1820600"," If you do look at, if we're down at 410, let's say,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1820600","1823600"," and you bought a 410, 415 wide spread for Friday,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1823600","1825600"," it's probably going to print for you."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1825600","1828600"," But you're going to need to worry about the sideways, the downs,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1828600","1832600"," and the fucker fucker round that's going to take place between now and Friday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1832600","1836600"," And yesterday's post we highlighted 440 as a big resistance point"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1836600","1838600"," due to the vol trigger appearing at that strike."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1838600","1840600"," This is another key one."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1840600","1842600"," This is what I had some problems with this morning."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1842600","1845600"," I had to go in and start looking down the road like a month down the road,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1845600","1847600"," six months down the road, that kind of shit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1847600","1850600"," The vol trigger has today dropped lower to 430."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1850600","1851600"," That's bad."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1852600","1854600"," Which is also another large open interest point."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1854600","1859600"," For this reason, we are marking down our key post FMC rally resistance line"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1859600","1862600"," from 440 to 430."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1862600","1863600"," That's big."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1863600","1864600"," That's huge."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1864600","1869600"," No 440s, no upper bounds of 450s, if more calls go in the market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1869600","1872600"," 430, much lower."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1873600","1877600"," We think that this level would be possibly in play for tomorrow or Friday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1878600","1880600"," So that gives you your time frame, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1880600","1883600"," 430 between tomorrow and Friday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1885600","1886600"," I'll leave this up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1886600","1888600"," You can come back and look at this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1888600","1892600"," Further, our OpEx tables show that large propositions don't start to roll off"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1892600","1894600"," until May, OpEx 520."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1895600","1901600"," With a more significant expiration on June 17th, quarterly OpEx."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1901600","1905600"," So you're starting to have to think about May and June, believe it or not."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1905600","1909600"," So you're going to get a bump, post OpEx in May."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1911600","1914600"," And then the June 17th, after June 17th."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1914600","1916600"," Other than that, the market's going down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1916600","1920600"," Not a lot of places for bulls to be hiding in May and June."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1921600","1924600"," So when we're down here at these levels, we'll look at a larger chart"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1924600","1926600"," over a larger time period."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1929600","1932600"," We're going to look at a larger time period here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1932600","1934600"," What they're saying to you,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1940600","1945600"," is that the market's more probably going to go down, or it can go up here,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1945600","1950600"," but then down and then up into June and then continue down,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1950600","1954600"," more than likely inside of this channel."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1954600","1957600"," This channel has a possibility of continuing."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1957600","1960600"," So you come down, come back up and come down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1960600","1962600"," On your own, draw your chart out here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1962600","1965600"," And so you're going to have to look at this chart."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1965600","1967600"," So you come down, come back up and come down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1967600","1971600"," On your own, draw your chart out here and start to figure in,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1971600","1974600"," hey, where are these bottoms going to be that I can buy?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1974600","1979600"," And where are these rips going to get sold above as time goes on, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1979600","1981600"," Now we're at one right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1981600","1984600"," So I'm not that concerned right now, believe it or not,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1984600","1985600"," but start to consider that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1985600","1988600"," There's going to be, they're implying that there's not going to be a break"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1988600","1990600"," above here to 450."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1990600","1994600"," It's going to be subdued, at least until June."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1994600","1999600"," That's a big, that's a big change, a big change in outlook."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","1999600","2006600"," As many of you know, we flag large expirations as key market turning points"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2006600","2009600"," due to the fact that triggered changes in dealer flows, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2009600","2014600"," So after May 20th, after June 17, assuming Powell does not spark fairs in the market,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2014600","2017600"," we are looking for a relief rally in markets which will function to provide"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2017600","2021600"," some breathing room to the downside versus current position of max put."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2021600","2027600"," Ultimately, if the market fails to recover, the vol trigger currently 430 level,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2027600","2032600"," then we'd view any rally as simply short covering with a high likelihood of"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2032600","2038600"," reversing, i.e. if we don't make 5, 430 by like Friday or Monday, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2038600","2041600"," They're going to get real nasty."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2041600","2046600"," If Powell does drive stock, so we look for a rather quick test of 4,000 to 4050,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2046600","2050600"," this would push S&P into large 4,000 sport and full floor bound."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2050600","2055600"," With that, we set up, we anticipate large, violent swings akin to late February,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2055600","2059600"," early March, with May 20th, OPEC's a turning point."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2059600","2065600"," So Shikka get nasty at 4,000, right? You'll see you've bounced off 4,000, up down, up down, up down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2065600","2069600"," One day, you literally, you're just trading, you're trading literally a bounce"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2069600","2072600"," and then literally a top. You'd sell a top as fast as you can."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2072600","2075600"," You wouldn't hold it overnight and you'd be right back down in the morning."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2075600","2078600"," Right back up in the afternoon to get real violent at 4,000."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2078600","2080600"," You're not going to break 4,000 like that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2080600","2086600"," It's going to be no violent moves. We break 4,000, start just careening down to 380, 360"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2086600","2088600"," unless you triggered panic in the market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2088600","2091600"," And even if you did, you're probably going to take some time."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2091600","2094600"," This is the violent hawkish move down below here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2097600","2100600"," So this isn't good for the market, right? You have to start thinking about,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2100600","2103600"," are we going to stay down here? You're also going to be thinking about"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2103600","2107600"," that 430 is going to be a big number for the market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2108600","2111600"," Huge number for the market. It's like a full court press from the Bears."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2111600","2116600"," The scary part about that is it's going to imply that the Bears,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2116600","2123600"," or the bar banks of the Bears are going to try to force some kind of acceptance"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2123600","2128600"," down here at 4,000, which does to an extent make sense."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2128600","2135600"," It makes that idea that if we're going to sacrifice the equities market,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2136600","2144600"," it means that they're going to tell you, this is your new training range down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2146600","2149600"," And we're going to pound you down here as time goes on."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2149600","2156600"," And eventually in June or July, it forced you to accept, let's say 380."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2159600","2161600"," Doesn't even you can't trade up here and make money,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2161600","2166600"," but it does mean that they're implying that over time between now and June"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2166600","2170600"," and July that, and especially the dog days of summer,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2170600","2174600"," that they're going to have you start accepting not 4,000, but like 380."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2174600","2179600"," There'll be a slow bleed out of the market if they can do the soft landing quote unquote."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2179600","2183600"," That would put us at like 360 in the fall."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2185600","2187600"," That's big."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2187600","2190600"," If you're an investor, if you're a bull investor,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2191600","2193600"," just considering that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2196600","2202600"," Considering that is going to be a hard pill for the 4,000 level of trust in this market,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2202600","2204600"," even for hedge funds."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2205600","2207600"," Not hedge funds, but."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2209600","2211600"," Well, we'll talk about it later, but."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2212600","2216600"," Large position holders in the spy, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2216600","2219600"," Large, you got Warren Buffett saying he's buying apple right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2219600","2222600"," Like this is going to make them scratch and consider their heads."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2224600","2228600"," Consider in their heads, hey, do I want to hold here at 380 or 360?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2229600","2233600"," Or is my time horizon longer where I'm buying between 4,000 and 360?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2234600","2239600"," This is big for a long term investor to have a pill to swallow."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2240600","2245600"," And there's an implication that some market participants are going to try to force that,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2245600","2248600"," you know, force feed that into the summer months."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2250600","2253600"," Okay, that doesn't mean there's dips to buy in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2253600","2257600"," Doesn't mean you're not going to really get in here and have some dips to buy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2257600","2260600"," Doesn't mean you're not going to have some test tops to sell if you're a bear,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2260600","2262600"," but just be conscious of that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2262600","2264600"," Now, with all that said,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2266600","2269600"," if we get down and we break above that 430, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2269600","2271600"," All bets are off with that bear straight."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2273600","2275600"," And you have to be open to that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2276600","2280600"," Even with this, even with this bearish outlook of two, three months down the road."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2281600","2284600"," Keep going through the cash equity close in Europe."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2285600","2287600"," Keep a part of your mind."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2288600","2291600"," Two and a half hours down to the FOMC announcement."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2292600","2293600"," On this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2294600","2298600"," On this trade hire on this bull tail risk trade hire."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2299600","2302600"," Because they can be locking in all these bears, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2302600","2304600"," And sure enough, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2304600","2305600"," The bear is like, fuck it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2305600","2306600"," We know we're going down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2306600","2307600"," We're going out of 360."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2308600","2312600"," I'm full tilt in and they just reverse it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2313600","2317600"," That has happened many times in previous bear markets."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2318600","2322600"," Many times where, believe it or not, the top is not in."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2324600","2326600"," And this will blow a bear's, a bear's asshole out."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2327600","2328600"," Shit, you're not in."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2329600","2333600"," By the time retail catches up to it, retail bulls catch up to it, it'll be the top."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2334600","2337600"," And they'll think that the bear market is over."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2339600","2343600"," So you're killing two retail traders with one stone."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2345600","2346600"," You're killing bears off."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2347600","2351600"," Blowing up a bear's account, believe it or not, because of the psychology of it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2352600","2357600"," And then by the time a bull enters and says, you know, bear market is over."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2358600","2364600"," And they're just full port and fucking Tesla at four, sixty or four, eighty or something."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2364600","2365600"," Or five hundred."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2365600","2368600"," They have full port and millions and millions of dollars, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2369600","2370600"," The time they actually believe it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2371600","2372600"," They're in there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2372600","2374600"," They actually sell it down violently."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2375600","2378600"," So just have this in the back of your mind at all times."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2379600","2384600"," Have that little tail rate, that little bull tail risk in the back of your mind that that could be potential."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2384600","2387600"," And 430 right now is the level that you're looking for."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2387600","2392600"," 430 up here is that turn around currently."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2392600","2395600"," That number will change, of course, as we trade in time."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2395600","2401600"," The vol trigger will come down here to 412, 410, 405, 400."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2402600","2404600"," To keep that on your palate as we move forward."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2408600","2409600"," Don't ever commit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2410600","2411600"," Right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2411600","2415600"," Be a price action trader, be a price action investor, especially the bull."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2415600","2418600"," And as a bear, you just have to have that in the back of your mind."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2418600","2419600"," You can have your conviction."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2419600","2421600"," You know, you can be like, hey, Cap, fuck you."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2421600","2423600"," This market's going down for the next year or two."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2423600","2424600"," Fuck you, Cap."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2424600","2425600"," We're going to have a market crash."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2425600","2426600"," That's fine."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2427600","2433600"," But in the back of your mind, at least leave the room, the capacity to change your viewpoint."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2433600","2440600"," And even if we do go up, if you're a bull, you have to know that it's still coming no matter what."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2441600","2444600"," The bear market's going to still be here even if we trade iron."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2445600","2446600"," It's there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2446600","2447600"," It's just it doesn't matter."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2447600","2448600"," It doesn't matter."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2448600","2451600"," It takes a year, three years for a market crash in two weeks."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2452600","2454600"," It's not going away at this point."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2455600","2461600"," There's nothing with short term debt, nothing with inflation, nothing with shortages, nothing with war on the horizon, even if the war is solved."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2462600","2465600"," That says that even with all, we have all kinds of other issues."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2465600","2468600"," The futures on some commodities demand is going to go down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2468600","2469600"," You've got to be sector."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2469600","2472600"," Yellen think she feels quite good about the strength of the US economy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2473600","2474600"," Nasty debt out there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2474600","2476600"," You've got zombie companies out there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2477600","2479600"," 50% of companies are zombie companies."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2480600","2482600"," Nothing that they're going to spew to you."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2482600","2483600"," You're going to go high."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2483600","2486600"," Nothing they're going to spew to you is going to is going to be valid."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2487600","2491600"," It's just this last rip higher, which happens all the time."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2491600","2494600"," I can show you examples of it all through modern history."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2494600","2498600"," It does feel quite good about the strength of the US economy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2499600","2500600"," It's relentless."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2500600","2503600"," It's like a six month, one year relentless up move."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2505600","2506600"," You're not going to want to believe it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2506600","2511600"," Someone was coming at this morning and said, I'm an old school bear."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2511600","2513600"," I know that that can happen."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2513600","2518600"," Yellen noted the negative first quarter GDP reading was not good."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2518600","2521600"," Bear's had a lying sign for the economy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2521600","2523600"," Bear's had it happen to him once before."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2523600","2524600"," Bulls didn't."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2524600","2528600"," So if bulls encounter that, they're not going to believe it either."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2528600","2536600"," Just be conscious of that if you're a new trader, if you're only been an investor for, I don't know, fucking five years or less or something like that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2536600","2538600"," You might not be prepared for it, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2539600","2543600"," So I want you to think about that as we trade this market down the road."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2543600","2550600"," So the idea is muted and spread out."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2550600","2552600"," Rips at this point."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2552600","2556600"," Expectations of the length of the night."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2556600","2557600"," They're not even rips really."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2557600","2561600"," Just the market melting up over days or weeks."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2561600","2566600"," And then looking for places to sell."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2566600","2569600"," If you're a bear, your next sell is 430 right around."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2569600","2570600"," That's what you're looking for."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2570600","2575600"," It's like a major position to short the market right around 430."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2575600","2578600"," Just absorb all that over over over."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2578600","2586600"," I'm saying that consumer spending and business investment does remain strong and America is outperforming other countries."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2587600","2595600"," The implication is, you know, it's reaching through the entire summer."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2595600","2596600"," I wouldn't panic."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2596600","2598600"," Self I was a bull here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2598600","2601600"," I'd be panicked on above it for 30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2601600","2605600"," If we don't break for 30 and hold it, that's where you start cutting shit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2606600","2611600"," If we don't break for 30 and hold it, that's where you start cutting shit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2611600","2612600"," Louis of your bull."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2612600","2613600"," We're down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2613600","2615600"," Panic sound for 4000."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2615600","2617600"," Wait for it to come back up at least."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2617600","2620600"," If you're like a bull, like I have been buying Apple for the past five years."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2620600","2622600"," Some kind of nonsense."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2622600","2628600"," And repeating that inflation is too high and the global economy has risks."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2628600","2632600"," You're going to hear negative news all day long today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2633600","2636600"," You're going to hear doom and gloom into this FMC."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2636600","2640600"," It's now 11.36 in the morning."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2640600","2642600"," Still haven't placed the trade."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2642600","2647600"," Told you that 11 between 11.30 and 1.30 right around there, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2647600","2650600"," Should see a dip to buy down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2650600","2655600"," Not quite there yet."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2655600","2658600"," Slow grind down, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2659600","2663600"," Not a place to buy in a dip, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2663600","2666600"," It's kind of floating out here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2666600","2670600"," Break above, trading down, trading down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2670600","2676600"," Take a look down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2676600","2680600"," We've got 412 waiting for a tap."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2680600","2684600"," Not much going on today in the market, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2684600","2687600"," Some dip buyers here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2687600","2688600"," Not many though."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2688600","2690600"," You might get a spike here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2690600","2697600"," Yellen saying slow growth in Europe could spill over."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2697600","2700600"," Still only have 68,000 bids down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2700600","2702600"," Not really that many, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2702600","2708600"," Not that much of 412."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2708600","2710600"," Not many at even 410."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2710600","2715600"," Just no bid in the market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2716600","2719600"," So what do you do in FMC today?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2719600","2720600"," You wait."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2720600","2721600"," Should have waited yesterday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2721600","2722600"," We talked about that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2722600","2723600"," I posted that on Twitter."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2723600","2725600"," I was like, I don't even want to trade today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2725600","2728600"," I don't want to be on Twitter today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2728600","2729600"," I want to hang out on Twitter today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2729600","2730600"," I don't want to be on live stream."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2730600","2732600"," No point."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2732600","2734600"," Same thing with this morning."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2734600","2737600"," You have no business in here buying this market this morning."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2737600","2744600"," You just kind of chill."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2745600","2750600"," Just wait and see what happens as we come in, as we trade down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2750600","2753600"," We're going to look for 412."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2753600","2762600"," See if that's a good spot."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2762600","2764600"," We're also going to tag one more down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2764600","2773600"," We're going to make this kind of like a five the fucking dip moment down here, 410."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2773600","2776600"," We'll also make this 410."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2776600","2778600"," Somewhere down here at this 412 to 410."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2778600","2784600"," We're also going to write down here that stops are down here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2784600","2795600"," This is where stops are down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2795600","2798600"," You'd day trade this right here, but why bother?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2798600","2809600"," There's no point."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2809600","2814600"," I'm going to take a quick moment here and then talk to some."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2814600","2819600"," If you're in here and you're a regular viewer, I did refund some people."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2819600","2827600"," I'm going to say who those people are real quick without a hold on here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2827600","2832600"," Ellen saying inflation is not deeply ingrained in the US economy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2832600","2837600"," The price for rises have not influenced medium term expectations."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2837600","2839600"," It doesn't say that it's weird."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2839600","2848600"," Yes, it's that every time this situation is different than what Volcker faced during his term at the Fed."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2848600","2863600"," Paypal is all fucked up again today, or at least I see my Instagram scroll through here and see if I see any."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2863600","2864600"," We'll pass on that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2864600","2866600"," I guess that didn't happen."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2866600","2871600"," Paypal came in and they were like, whoa buddy, we're flagging you."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2871600","2880600"," I actually got to talk to somebody, a live human and had like a court case and I won the court case."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2880600","2885600"," My paypal is back up and running."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2885600","2889600"," Some safe."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2889600","2894600"," Fucking PayPal."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2894600","2896600"," Okay, so let's go up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2896600","2902600"," Scroll the top here so you guys are staying here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2902600","2905600"," Check out Riot."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2905600","2909600"," Charlie Charles 403 465 Biden is speaking right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2909600","2911600"," Biden is yapping."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2911600","2913600"," Is he really?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2913600","2914600"," Biden's talking."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2914600","2916600"," Yeah, I don't care about him talking at all."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2916600","2923600"," There's nothing or I'm going to take care less."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2923600","2927600"," Elmero stands by sits in the 1.68 level from March, February, March, 2025."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2927600","2934600"," Next level down is 342, which is the February, 2020 high and a breakout best best best bet on the monthly."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2934600","2936600"," Yeah, I haven't even looked on the idea."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2936600","2943600"," Or I needed to show a monthly chart with the larger that larger timeframe."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2943600","2944600"," See what's going on here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2944600","2945600"," Biden speaking now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2945600","2947600"," Biden is live."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2947600","2948600"," Biden is already live."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2948600","2950600"," They changed it to 11 Eastern time."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2951600","2954600"," Is he saying anything about price controls?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2954600","2956600"," Fuck, no more swearing."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2956600","2959600"," Supposedly, there's a rule that says I can't swear."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2959600","2965600"," I can swear after like the first five minutes of some Biden speaking right now, not to."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2965600","2972600"," That's good that he's speaking now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2972600","2978600"," I don't like the fact of him speaking at 2 p.m."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2978600","2985600"," He didn't mention price controls, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2985600","2995600"," What I think about Jamie Diamond and what he's saying, he's long this market without a doubt."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2995600","2998600"," Could get to 400 by end of day, not impossible."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","2998600","3003600"," No, it's not impossible to get to a capsule bear porn today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3003600","3004600"," That's it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3004600","3006600"," Smack, Evan saying, 412, 410 is important."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3006600","3008600"," Level due to high OI."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3008600","3014600"," Yeah, vault triggers down to 430."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3014600","3019600"," What else do you guys say in here?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3019600","3026600"," KPR goes down with 30 minute going to buy the whole company."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3026600","3031600"," More from Treasury Secretary Yellen saying the desire was to avoid the kind of scarring that"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3031600","3038600"," caused the global financial crisis."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3038600","3041600"," Trying to steal three of all comments."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3041600","3046600"," Lobe says, I'm a bear and love you cap because you're 100% with all sides."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3046600","3053600"," Saying that she believes inflation is being slightly driven by historically tight labor."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3053600","3057600"," So when he's saying we'll be at 5100 on SPX at some point before 2023."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3057600","3058600"," I agree with that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3058600","3060600"," I think it depends on where we go, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3060600","3066600"," But I think that's on the table."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3066600","3068600"," Can I bump my mic voice up?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3068600","3072600"," Yeah, let me take a look at my mic voice real quick."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3072600","3073600"," Check one, two."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3073600","3081600"," That says that it's loud here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3081600","3086600"," I'm missing something here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3087600","3094600"," The difference today, change your strategy for the market price indicator trade strikes"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3094600","3095600"," the expression."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3095600","3097600"," We'll talk about that later this afternoon."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3097600","3099600"," To buy the news volume is loud."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3099600","3100600"," Okay."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3100600","3106600"," I'll turn that down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3106600","3107600"," Trade the news."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3107600","3110600"," I'll turn that down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3110600","3112600"," SPY can be making a falling wedge lunchtime."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3112600","3115600"," Can you let us know when to buy?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3115600","3116600"," I'll let you know when I buy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3116600","3118600"," I don't ever tell you guys when to buy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3118600","3119600"," I just tell you when I buy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3119600","3122600"," Can you give or take on the S?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3122600","3124600"," This is for your summer trades from Como Lowes."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3124600","3126600"," Seems like we're heading toward that level."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3126600","3127600"," Yeah."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3127600","3132600"," I think the whole like 34 to 3600, I think there's a large area there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3132600","3137600"," I wouldn't ever shock me to go that low or even just to bounce off like 38."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3137600","3144000"," There's a lot of dynamics in the market that no one out there can tell you, yes, we're"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3144000","3149000"," going here first or they're going there first for the rate at which we go somewhere."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3149000","3156000"," There's a real concern that the soft landing thing I believe in that they're going to"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3156000","3157000"," attempt."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3157000","3163600"," I agree that if there's a violent move below 4000, you could trigger violent selling in"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3163600","3164600"," the market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3164600","3165600"," So I don't think they want to do that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3165600","3167400"," I don't even think banks want to do that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3167400","3170000"," I don't think anybody wants to do that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3170000","3171000"," Yeah."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3171000","3172000"," Tesla."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3173000","3176000"," All of that applies to Tesla that I went through."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3176000","3183000"," Everything that I spoke about with Tesla applies to what I already just told you everything."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3183000","3186000"," Tesla is moving with the market at this point."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3186000","3189000"," Know that for a fact, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3189000","3194000"," No matter what you think, that will move with the market with that first rant that I went"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3194000","3200000"," on for 45 minutes or so."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3200000","3202000"," That's what you guys are saying here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3202000","3203000"," Yeah."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3203000","3204000"," PayPal does stink."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3204000","3205000"," It's over."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3205000","3207000"," Biden doesn't talk."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3207000","3209000"," He just mumbles random words."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3209000","3210000"," What's he actually coherent?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3210000","3215000"," They didn't talk about price controls, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3215000","3226000"," Hey, Cap, why is vol trigger being lowered, lowered bad?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3226000","3227000"," That's a good question."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3227000","3228000"," That's a good question."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3228000","3234240"," It's not a question for today, but as the market moves lower, they're forcing you now"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3234240","3235240"," to accept lower prices."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3235240","3238240"," I can get into it later, but that's a good question."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3238240","3245240"," Let's be that on a slow day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3245240","3246240"," Yeah."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3246240","3247240"," No."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3247240","3248240"," Cheatin's asking."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3248240","3251240"," Cheatin's asking Cap regardless of how we're down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3251240","3254240"," Try as long as we have these lows, dips, and high rips, there's might be made."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3254240","3255240"," Am I wrong?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3255240","3256240"," No, you do."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3256240","3257240"," I'm a bull."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3257240","3258240"," I'll be honest with you."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3258240","3260240"," I hate selling."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3260240","3261240"," I will sell."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3261240","3264240"," If we get it way up there, I'll sell with a put spread."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3265240","3269240"," Right now, I still love buying dips."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3269240","3274240"," We'll make this really short."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3274240","3276240"," I can't find the article right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3276240","3282240"," You can find them, though, on the internet, but you should look up the history of the put."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3282240","3285240"," But protective puts are only meant for protection."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3285240","3286240"," They're one-to-one."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3286240","3288240"," They pay one-to-one, basically."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3288240","3292240"," They're not meant for you to buy some puts and hold them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3293240","3294240"," They're just not."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3294240","3295240"," They're not built for that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3295240","3296240"," Calls are."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3296240","3298240"," And we didn't even have put to the market at one time."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3298240","3300240"," They're very much like the Vicks."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3300240","3303240"," So, personally, I don't like buying puts."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3303240","3307240"," I don't like to pay off the risk, the time, and the put, the timing of puts."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3307240","3309240"," So, I like to buy dips."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3309240","3312240"," Even if the market goes down, I'd like to buy dips."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3312240","3314240"," Nice little rip off the spy real quick."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3314240","3320240"," Nice little short covering taking place in the spy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3321240","3323240"," You can go back in history and know that there are great dips to buy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3323240","3326240"," You can know in a bear market that you'll have 10% rip, space ripping rallies."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3326240","3328240"," So, yes, I agree."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3328240","3332240"," I agree that I still think that the whole way down, you can buy some kickass."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3332240","3333240"," Kickass rip."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3333240","3341240"," The whole way down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3341240","3349240"," Tesla."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3350240","3352240"," You can always go back and hear the rant."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3353240","3356240"," Hell yeah, Kevin gang."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3356240","3360080"," If you're just joining us, you should go back to the beginning of this program and listen"

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3366240","3367240"," Nice little bounce."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3367240","3368240"," That looks like they bought."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3368240","3371240"," That actually looks like some dark pool buying down here at 412."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3371240","3375240"," So, we did touch 412 down below, even if you didn't see it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3375240","3378240"," They tagged it right down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3379240","3385240"," So, we'll see how far up this can go or where some resistances above."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3385240","3391240"," 417.25 would be a place, a notable place above here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3391240","3397240"," 417.21 if you bought that dip."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3397240","3400240"," That tag down below here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3409240","3413240"," There's a V wop right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3413240","3415240"," This will be some minor resistance here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3415240","3419240"," And then we've got 417.21 somewhere right up in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3419240","3421240"," So, our bears are waiting right up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3421240","3426240"," Treasury Secretary Yellen just saying that she believes in market-based values for the"

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3449240","3451240"," 1130?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3451240","3454240"," Oh, shit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3454240","3459240"," How FMCs take place?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3459240","3462240"," 1136 you got to bounce."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3462240","3464240"," So, I think I said 1130 to 1."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3464240","3469240"," 130 or something."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3469240","3474240"," Right down here, 412 and then above 417.15."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3474240","3476240"," You may get a little bit of resistance."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3535240","3538240"," I feel is a better read on the strength of economy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3538240","3540240"," America is outperforming other countries inflation is too high."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3540240","3542240"," It needs to be brought down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3542240","3546240"," IE, we're going to sacrifice the equities market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3546240","3548240"," That's what she means."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3549240","3551240"," Global economy still presents risks."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3551240","3553240"," Slower growth in Europe could spill over to the U.S."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3553240","3555240"," Inflation is not deeply ingrained."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3555240","3560240"," In the U.S. economy, price rises have not influenced medium term expectations."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3560240","3569240"," This also attacked the LPT in our model for Q2, taking it to 2.2% from 1.6%."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3572240","3575240"," Another key point that she made this morning was inflation is not deeply ingrained."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3575240","3579240"," In the U.S. economy, prices have not influenced medium term expectations."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3677240","3685240"," Payment border flow."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3685240","3688240"," You agree to buy something or sell something at a price."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3688240","3692240"," It's packaged in its spot or sold to a larger bank."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3692240","3697240"," No one goes on to say that PE ratios in the stock market are high as well."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3700240","3702240"," Look up payment for order flow."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3716240","3725240"," Yellen saying that she doesn't make concern about spillovers from the Russia, Ukraine war."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3730240","3732240"," You want to know about the VIX?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3732240","3735240"," If you're a bear, you should buy this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3735240","3738240"," Because this will rip higher if we get a hawkish statement."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3738240","3741240"," If you're a bull, you wait for this to drop off down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","3741240","3744240"," We will go to 20."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4073240","4084240"," Some of you guys don't, but order flow for sale is done by almost all brokerages except for a brokerage that's backed by a bank."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4084240","4087240"," Some are worse than others."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4087240","4089240"," Some are better than others."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4089240","4091240"," Some are really bad like Robinhood."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4091240","4101240"," And then if you're buying stock, you always want to buy stock through a bank brokerage, like bank right from the bank, like Schwab."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4101240","4104240"," But options, options flow that's for sale."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4104240","4105240"," That's different too."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4118240","4127240"," Tasty was tasty allowed you a little bit of room to play with in there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4127240","4139240"," But this whole Russia thing that took place, you could still trade some of these Russian stocks and ETFs longer on a bank than you could with some of these shitty brokerages like Robinhood or whatever."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4139240","4141240"," You had more time to get out, more time to get in if you want."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4141240","4149240"," Some people wanted to buy that clothes on some of these tickers."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4165240","4167240"," That was the Tesla book map for me."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4167240","4168240"," Yeah."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4175240","4177240"," Firm support at 850 ish."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4177240","4180240"," This is really good ball to see."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4180240","4181240"," Right."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4181240","4183240"," 850 to 820."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4183240","4185240"," This 820 is going to match up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4185240","4190240"," And this 800 believe it or not is going to match up to all this ball is going to match up to the 4000."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4190240","4191240"," Right."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4212240","4215240"," Resistance here at nine."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4215240","4220240"," Twelve secretary yelling saying in the US decision to impose sanctions on the Russian."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4220240","4222240"," There's not a lot of, not a lot of action test either."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4222240","4227240"," That's not a thing that very light trading on Tesla today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4228240","4231240"," Resistance here at nine."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4231240","4236240"," Twelve secretary yelling saying in the US decision to impose sanctions on the Russian central bank."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4236240","4237240"," Lot of shorts."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4237240","4238240"," Taken lightly."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4240240","4244240"," A lot of pressure on Tesla right now at this 907."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4247240","4249240"," A lot of downward pressure trying to push down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4249240","4251240"," This is squeezable and it can burn."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4253240","4255240"," Most definitely here watching this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4255240","4256240"," Do you see this right here?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4257240","4259240"," Lot of sellers up here on Tesla."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4262240","4265240"," They're trying to break through not only 850."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4266240","4271240"," Like grind through this 858 30 and 800."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4271240","4273240"," If you have a break here at 800, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4273240","4276240"," You're going to start, you're going to start banging through levels down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4278240","4280240"," So 800 is kind of your place."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4280240","4282240"," That's your last stand."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4286240","4288240"," And there's light trading right now in Tesla."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4289240","4292240"," So let's look at it on a lot of candlestick chart."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4301240","4303240"," Same chart, haven't changed it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4304240","4306240"," Haven't touched it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4311240","4312240"," You can see it here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4313240","4314240"," This bearish."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4316240","4317240"," I think it can come up from here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4317240","4320240"," Yep, you should be doing this trading Tesla with the market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4321240","4323240"," But you have this initial drop down here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4323240","4326240"," Rejection, rejection, rejection."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4328240","4330240"," And those lower lows that you're looking for, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4330240","4333240"," There's that 850, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4335240","4338240"," If you start breaking, though, this 800, this is going to be a key for you."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4338240","4340240"," Make mark this on your own chart."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4340240","4342240"," If you start really not going down a 780, come back up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4342240","4346240"," If you start breaking this 800 line, it can get violent."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4346240","4349240"," It'll be a swift move down, believe it or not."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4349240","4351240"," 750, 650, somewhere down in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4353240","4355240"," Haven't made any changes to this chart."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4355240","4357240"," Nothing has changed on this chart."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4357240","4359240"," I've added to it, but nothing has changed."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4359240","4361240"," Even these have been here for a couple of weeks."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4363240","4365240"," I think it was a home hours blog or something."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4365240","4368240"," I say he said he bought an 850, and I was like, that's a great buy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4369240","4372240"," It's a great buy, 850."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4373240","4376240"," This is your defend line down here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4376240","4377240"," 850."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4380240","4384240"," If we get down to 4,000 and we actually start doing some real money selling,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4384240","4386240"," if you get panic in the market, they're not a dozen in the market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4386240","4388240"," That's just banks panic, real panic."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4388240","4394240"," You would definitely, you'd swiftly see 650, 750, believe it or not."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4395240","4400240"," But I'm in the mind that we go up today, so if you're looking for a dip to buy today"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4400240","4402240"," in weakness, where is that dip?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4404240","4406240"," We know where it is, that 850."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4407240","4409240"," Right down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4417240","4419240"," So 850 is my price target for today, believe it or not."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4419240","4421240"," Where are we at right now?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4422240","4423240"," Not 895."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4423240","4426240"," I think it goes down another 50 points today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4426240","4428240"," Into weakness into FOMC."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4441240","4443240"," I think we get some weakness."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4444240","4445240"," It's holding up well."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4445240","4450240"," This is like smoking a cigarette and being on the rings right now in the old school,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4451240","4455240"," I mean, I'm still holding, I'm still holding, I'm still holding."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4457240","4459240"," There's a dangerous trade holding here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4463240","4465240"," It's going to get rejected."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4470240","4472240"," The good thing is you get a lot of buyers down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4472240","4473240"," We're looking for a dip."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4473240","4474240"," This isn't like weakness here either."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4474240","4478240"," This is just dip buyers waiting for a buy down here on BookMap at least."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4479240","4482240"," I'm looking to pick up anything that they can on a positive fed statement,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4484240","4486240"," which I would expect out of Tesables, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4486240","4487240"," This isn't like looking at a normal ticker."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4492240","4495240"," It's like looking at Tesables will tell you that the market's always going up,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4495240","4497240"," so you have to keep that in mind."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4499240","4501240"," Can Tesla get to 850?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4502240","4506240"," They got to hear some pretty bad news for it to get to 850."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4509240","4510240"," All right."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4510240","4513240"," So it's time is it now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4513240","4514240"," It's 1207."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4529240","4530240"," You see this right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4530240","4531240"," Rejection here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4531240","4532240"," Trade it higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4532240","4533240"," Off the bell."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4533240","4534240"," Sold it down below."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4535240","4537240"," This is the current channel that we're in."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4537240","4539240"," We're actually trading below it right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4539240","4541240"," Is that light resistance?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4541240","4543240"," They want to keep it down below, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4543240","4546240"," You break below some support from up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4546240","4547240"," Rejection, rejection."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4547240","4549240"," We start heading lower."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4550240","4552240"," We want to see us get a break above."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4552240","4554240"," This is bullish up here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4555240","4558240"," Maybe start doing this and then we're up higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4561240","4563240"," Time is grinding around in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4568240","4569240"," Excuse me."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4575240","4576240"," Wow."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4576240","4577240"," Someone just described."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4577240","4578240"," All right."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4578240","4579240"," All right."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4579240","4580240"," You're sent."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4580240","4581240"," Thank you for subscribing."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4581240","4582240"," But wait a minute."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4582240","4583240"," What do I do?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4583240","4585240"," I don't know what I just did here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4585240","4586240"," More macro data."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4586240","4590240"," The association of American railroads out with a weekly traffic report."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4590240","4592240"," It was down 7% this week in aggregate."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4592240","4595240"," The car loads down 4.5% and intermodal down almost 10%."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4609240","4611240"," We'll see if they can break through this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4611240","4613240"," Again, we're going to take one more step at it here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4623240","4630240"," Yeah, they're up here hiding."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4634240","4636240"," They're definitely up here hiding."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4640240","4641240"," 4.17.50."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4641240","4642240"," 4.16.48."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4642240","4644240"," Right where we are right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4644240","4646240"," Those are still hiding there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4653240","4663240"," No, I wanted to buy that so bad and I'm like, I ain't buying it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4663240","4666240"," This is where I get caught, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4666240","4672240"," This is where I get caught where I would have bought that dip down there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4672240","4676240"," And then it rolls over in patients is what I call it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4682240","4703240"," In patients."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4703240","4705240"," Let me see you guys are talking about here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4705240","4711240"," You're welcome for the Tesla tour."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4712240","4714240"," Thank God for saying that so far is going ham."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4714240","4715240"," I'm not sure why."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4715240","4720240"," Do you guys hear that subscription chime always or is that something new?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4720240","4722240"," I've never seen it until just today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4727240","4729240"," This bullgates going to win."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4729240","4732240"," I never saw that until today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4732240","4733240"," Hey, Joe."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4733240","4734240"," How are you?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4734240","4736240"," Good to see you, Joe."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4737240","4742240"," So you're saying June 4.40 C is $3.50 right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4742240","4746240"," Wiki, have you looked it up on the on the."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4746240","4750240"," Have you looked at the July price for that?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4750240","4756240"," What the payout is on June and July."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4756240","4759240"," San Yaka, Sato Yaka."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4759240","4760240"," Oh, yeah."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4760240","4761240"," Some people are in here subscribing."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4761240","4762240"," Thank you for subscribing."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4763240","4765240"," I want you all to know that I fixed PayPal."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4765240","4767240"," My PayPal bull should have fixed all that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4767240","4770240"," I won."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4770240","4772240"," They had flagged me as there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4772240","4777240"," So they flagged me and they were like, they flagged me and they were like, we're seizing all your money."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4777240","4781240"," I was like, what do you mean you're seizing all my money?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4781240","4784240"," They're like, they're like, we're seizing it all."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4784240","4789240"," And we have some problems with you accepting tips."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4790240","4795240"," And they were like, we want you to turn into a subscription service."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4795240","4800240"," And I was like, ain't fucking doing that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4800240","4802240"," I have a business and all that kind of stuff."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4802240","4807240"," So I had to talk to them and ended up winning, believe it or not."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4807240","4810240"," So they turned PayPal back on for me."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4810240","4815240"," So I'm very happy at this point that they've turned it back on."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4815240","4818240"," But they prefer that I do like a monthly thing."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4819240","4824240"," They want something where you're like signing up and I send you a receipt and say, thank you."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4824240","4826240"," This is what you're getting for a month."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4826240","4829240"," But I did end up winning that case with PayPal."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4829240","4832240"," So I'm very happy this morning in that sense of the word."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4832240","4838240"," I'm not being forced into what they're trying to force me into, which is a paid model."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4838240","4839240"," And I don't like the paid model."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4839240","4845240"," I would prefer the if you're happy with what you're getting."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4845240","4856240"," I know it devalues what we're doing here, but it's not what I'm about."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4856240","4857240"," It's right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4857240","4860240"," You see the same light resistance here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4860240","4862240"," Draw a little bull flag in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4862240","4870240"," A little intraday bull flag."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4870240","4871240"," Another one down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4871240","4874240"," Let's move this out of the way, at least."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4874240","4881240"," You can see we're dealing with here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4881240","4884240"," A little bit of shenanigans going on here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4884240","4888240"," See if we rip that thing higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4888240","4894240"," Move this over here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4894240","4896240"," See if we can get a little play going on."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4896240","4903240"," A little intraday bull play."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4903240","4905240"," And we'll check the C over here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4905240","4917240"," If we blast off price target above 417.30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4917240","4930240"," We'll just change resistance to price target."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4930240","4932240"," We'll switch this over here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4932240","4934240"," We'll change resistance to price target right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4934240","4936240"," For this 417.80."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4936240","4942240"," If you want to get more technical about it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4942240","4946240"," We have light resistance here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4946240","4948240"," We already know that, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4948240","4952240"," Trying to build up some bullishness here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4952240","4954240"," Get some more buyers to go in the market right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4954240","4957240"," Try to push this thing and blast off."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4957240","4961240"," We'll be looking for something like this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4961240","4965240"," We're up in there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4965240","4985240"," We don't have a lot of runway for an intraday trade."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4985240","4989240"," We're starting to move it on up in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4989240","4991240"," Keep it right down here, right around that 417 ish."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4991240","4995240"," See if we can start blasting up there or not."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4995240","4997240"," So I walked in."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","4997240","5001240"," So I walked into the fin Twitter middle of the night and started blasting."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5001240","5008240"," Still like that one."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5008240","5011240"," I got really drunk late at night time."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5011240","5013240"," I started making posts about it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5013240","5015240"," I shouldn't be posting about pissing people off."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5015240","5021240"," Last night I posted one of those things called."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5021240","5028240"," I posted my little pony song where you want to take a screwdriver"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5028240","5031240"," and just grind your eyeballs out."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5031240","5035240"," Can you imagine being a prisoner and having to listen to that"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5035240","5038240"," run repeat for like two days?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5038240","5047240"," I don't know if it would take that long."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5047240","5048240"," Some nice buyers in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5048240","5051240"," It's nice to see these buyers in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5051240","5057240"," Lots of buyers down in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5057240","5058240"," I might jump in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5058240","5062240"," If we can get a little, I might jump in this trade."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5062240","5065240"," If we can get a little bit of this down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5065240","5072240"," I think I want to miss the trade, but if we get a little."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5072240","5074240"," If we get a little bit of."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5074240","5077240"," Like that, I might take that trade for that right there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5077240","5080240"," That'd be a nice little seredate play."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5080240","5086240"," Fuck around the market for a minute or two."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5086240","5088240"," 1216 in the afternoon."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5088240","5093240"," We're going to be expecting the FOMC at."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5093240","5098240"," 2pm and then 2.30, both important."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5098240","5101240"," They said that Biden came out and didn't try to step on the toes of."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5101240","5103240"," That was kind of crazy yesterday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5103240","5107240"," They're going to release the report and they're also going to have Biden speaking at the same time."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5107240","5111240"," Like that was insane."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5111240","5116240"," Even consider that's insane."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5117240","5120240"," I'm a little happy that it was earlier or not later too."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5120240","5125240"," It implies that not so hawkish fed, believe it or not."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5125240","5128240"," There you get like a president speaking after the fed speaking."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5128240","5133240"," It's the probably to calm the markets to be honest with you."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5133240","5135240"," More than likely."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5147240","5150240"," Oh, you couldn't see that you rainbow unicorn shit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5150240","5152240"," Oh, yeah, that stuff is the worst part of it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5152240","5154240"," You know, introduce me to it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5154240","5155240"," My daughter."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5155240","5158240"," And of course she played it for me like once."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5158240","5159240"," And then I was on it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5159240","5161240"," I was like, I was like, I like this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5161240","5163240"," I was like, I hate this song."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5163240","5165240"," It's like that I'm never going to give you up song."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5165240","5168240"," It's totally mean like totally like they're going to give you up or whatever."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5168240","5171240"," Or whatever that guy that meme song is."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5177240","5178240"," Yes."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5178240","5181240"," Alex is saying I reckon you know, but PayPal does then 10 and nine forms."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5181240","5182240"," Iris over here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5182240","5183240"," Yeah."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5183240","5184240"," So might."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5184240","5185240"," So just to be clear."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5185240","5191240"," I have had many business accounts with PayPal and this is a business account specifically"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5191240","5193240"," for this channel."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5193240","5199240"," But normally they like to see invoices."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5199240","5201240"," They want to see like a service."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5202240","5208240"," Like a magazine or newsletter or something like that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5208240","5210240"," So everything is legit with my taxes."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5210240","5211240"," Everything is legit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5211240","5214240"," What they were what they had said to me was that they had said, look, you get payments"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5214240","5220240"," for like a dollar, $3, $5, $7."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5220240","5222240"," And you're not, what are you?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5222240","5223240"," What are you selling?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5223240","5224240"," Do you have?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5224240","5226240"," They're like, you have to provide."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5227240","5232240"," You have to provide some kind of like proof that you're selling something."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5232240","5236240"," And you're like, you're selling something tangible."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5236240","5239240"," Like you're paying for a month of access to this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5239240","5240240"," You're paying for this video."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5240240","5243240"," You're paying for this newsletter."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5243240","5244240"," There we go."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5244240","5246240"," There goes the spy baby."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5246240","5248240"," Blasting off."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5248240","5251240"," There it goes."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5251240","5254240"," Squeezy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5255240","5258240"," Price target for 1715."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5258240","5262240"," So they're asking for like that's what they're asking for."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5262240","5265240"," So of course I have to go back in and try to fix it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5265240","5267240"," And of course they don't want to hear it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5267240","5269240"," They just shut you down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5269240","5271240"," So of course I'm panicking."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5271240","5274240"," I look up on YouTube and they're like, well, not only can they freeze your accounts."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5274240","5278240"," But at some point they will close the account."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5278240","5280240"," And you won't have access to money."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5280240","5281240"," You can't refund money."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5282240","5286240"," There's some real nasty shit that can take place for a lot of money."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5286240","5287240"," Which supports this channel."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5287240","5294240"," So of course I go on YouTube and I'm telling everybody you just end all of your monthly"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5294240","5295240"," tips."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5295240","5298240"," Like some people have sent it for monthly."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5298240","5305240"," And also if I can get refunds, I will because I don't want PayPal to keep your money either."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5305240","5307240"," If I'm not getting it, you're not getting it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5307240","5308240"," I want them to keep it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5308240","5309240"," So I'm going to send it back to you."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5310240","5315240"," But when they're talking to me about this, I had to explain to them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5315240","5317240"," In person I had to explain to them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5321240","5322240"," Be careful as we come up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5322240","5327240"," I want you to know that though those sellers might be right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5327240","5331240"," They can sometimes push down violently."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5331240","5334240"," So you take a little off table as we head up towards this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5335240","5338240"," And we'll watch the book map to see if they're being pushed higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5338240","5340240"," But currently they're not."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5340240","5343240"," So when they're not being pushed higher, they tend to swoop down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5343240","5345240"," There's a swooping down action on sellers."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5345240","5347240"," So we'll look at that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5347240","5350240"," That's a nice little trade right there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5350240","5351240"," One little rip."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5351240","5352240"," Nice little bull flag."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5352240","5353240"," Grip it up higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5353240","5354240"," Nice little 100 day play."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5354240","5356240"," See if it can get up to 417.50."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5356240","5357240"," It's up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5357240","5359240"," Doesn't look like much right now, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5359240","5362240"," The key you're looking for is as we trade up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5363240","5366240"," You want to see if these sellers push higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5366240","5369240"," We are a little bit 418.27 currently."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5369240","5370240"," You can see them up above."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5370240","5372240"," You watch this number right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5372240","5376240"," If you see this number slide higher, not starts swooping down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5376240","5379240"," You can get up to that target, that price target above."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5379240","5382240"," So we'll keep the screen right as it is right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5382240","5384240"," And pay attention to these sellers."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5384240","5385240"," See them right here?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5385240","5387240"," I'll give you more accurate price target."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5387240","5391240"," 417 is where they are right."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5391240","5396240"," So we'll lower it on our candlestick part."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5396240","5400240"," We'll keep this one right here for you so we can track these sellers."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5400240","5403240"," You don't want to see them swoop down right here, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5403240","5405240"," You still have buyers here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5405240","5407240"," You still have buyers here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5407240","5408240"," Trade and hire now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5408240","5410240"," Price target 417.14."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5410240","5412240"," Beautiful bull flag."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5412240","5416240"," If you're in calls right now, congratulations."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5422240","5426240"," So I had a talk with PayPal."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5426240","5432240"," And the guy was like, no answer, no nothing."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5432240","5435240"," Couldn't give me any information."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5435240","5440240"," Just wanted my statements and wanted to see what I produced, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5440240","5443240"," And I have to tell them, you know, I don't charge for subscriptions."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5443240","5445240"," This is big right here watching this right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5445240","5450240"," As we come up to this 417.14, some of the sellers who have now moved higher"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5450240","5451240"," to 418.83."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5451240","5453240"," This is a big development here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5453240","5454240"," We'll see."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5454240","5457240"," There should be some resistance still at this 417.14."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5457240","5461240"," So pull the plug, take your money, and then look for another leg up, believe it or not,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5461240","5464240"," to 419 as long as these sellers don't come down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5464240","5466240"," Huge moves here for the spy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5466240","5467240"," Enter a day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5467240","5468240"," Look at that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5468240","5471240"," Huge moves for a price target at 417.14."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5471240","5473240"," Nice little push higher here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5473240","5476240"," Beautiful little push higher here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5477240","5482240"," Also, sellers being pushed higher from 417 up to 418 and 418.50 up even higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5482240","5486240"," So we'll see if we can punch through and get up there to 418."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5486240","5488240"," Beautiful fucking move real quick."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5488240","5489240"," Cypress and swears."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5489240","5495240"," A bear is being pushed back and above to believe it or not, 418.82."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5495240","5497240"," So we'll see if they stay up there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5497240","5498240"," We'll keep this here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5498240","5500240"," This is your first price target here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5500240","5503240"," 418.82 is quite high."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5507240","5509240"," Way up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5509240","5511240"," Way up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5511240","5513240"," So that's price target one."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5513240","5520240"," Be careful there's a cotton on it's excitement too because they'll rug pull your ass at some point."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5520240","5524240"," You'll be all up in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5524240","5525240"," You'll be all up in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5525240","5527240"," And then all of a sudden you'll be like, oh shit, it's 130."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5527240","5533240"," Price target two right here above 418.81 on the spy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5534240","5537240"," Nice little dip by almost right at 11.30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5537240","5539240"," Boom, boom, not buying it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5539240","5543240"," We're going higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5543240","5549240"," Maybe it's a fed leak."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5549240","5553240"," Hell's yes."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5553240","5554240"," Gorgeous."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5554240","5557240"," Some of these sellers now coming down real quick."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5557240","5560240"," They're applying some pressure to the spies by trying to tell you hell no."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5560240","5565240"," We're not going up there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5565240","5570240"," So yeah, so then all of a sudden it was really weird too."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5570240","5575240"," Yeah, no, I'm not blaming PayPal."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5575240","5576240"," Exactly."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5576240","5577240"," Exactly."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5577240","5578240"," You got it right."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5578240","5582240"," They don't like tips because there's no way to prove that I haven't gotten any value from anything."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5582240","5583240"," Exactly."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5583240","5585240"," I agree with that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5585240","5586240"," Wiggy faces."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5586240","5589240"," Absolutely knows what he's talking about."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5589240","5594240"," So then by explaining what I do, as I had to explain them, I was like, look, I was like,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5594240","5596240"," I don't like the idea of pay to play."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5596240","5602240"," I like the idea of only pay if because they were wondering about chargebacks."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5602240","5604240"," I talked about chargebacks."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5604240","5610240"," I was like, look, I was like, you get chargebacks when you charge somebody."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5610240","5614240"," I was like, I was like, you want to know how you get chargebacks?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5614240","5619240"," And look, you get chargebacks from fucking charging somebody fucking $600 for the month."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5619240","5628240"," And then the fucking alpha guy doesn't show up until one of the afternoon twice a week."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5628240","5631240"," That's how you get chargebacks."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5631240","5635240"," Because people are like, what the fuck did I pay for?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5635240","5637240"," And I like my idea."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5637240","5643240"," My idea is you don't pay me unless I give you better alpha or I give you alpha and you profit from it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5644240","5648240"," If you make a hundred bucks or a thousand bucks or five thousand or a hundred thousand,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5648240","5651240"," you know, if you're like, fuck that guy ain't paying him."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5651240","5652240"," Well, you know, fuck you too."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5652240","5654240"," I don't need you around me."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5654240","5659240"," But I know there are traders out there and investors out there that follow me here and they do support the channel."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5659240","5662240"," There's a core group of them and they're fucking awesome."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5662240","5664240"," And I want those people around me."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5664240","5667240"," I'm friends of them outside of this too, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5667240","5668240"," You know who you all are out there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5668240","5669240"," There's a bunch of you out there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5669240","5674240"," Ben Godfrees, Joe Harpers, Chaz, Winky, Binky, Josh, Chad."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5674240","5676240"," Because the list goes on, Jill."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5676240","5678240"," There's a ton of you out there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5678240","5680240"," Some of you out there, tip me like a dollar."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5680240","5685240"," You guys fucking, I love you the most."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5685240","5687240"," So there's nothing to fucking hide here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5687240","5691240"," A lot of those alpha guys out there, all these channels and subscriptions that are sold, they hide behind that shit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5691240","5697240"," And the fucked up part is they're charging you five hundred bucks, thousand bucks a month for churn."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5697240","5703240"," They're charging you and you blow up your accounts and then the next group comes in and they're advertising for it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5703240","5705240"," And also they're fucking nonsense."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5705240","5708240"," And they're literally preying on new traders."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5708240","5710240"," I'm not down with that shit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5710240","5712240"," I'm not down praying on new traders."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5712240","5717240"," I'm down on fucking teaching a trader how to make, make himself some bread, some money."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5719240","5721240"," That's what I'm here for."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5722240","5726240"," And if you make money along the way, you'll, you'll tip me."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5728240","5731240"," People that are serious about this shit, this is their life as they do."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5731240","5734240"," People that are like, they eat shit and sleep stock market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5736240","5737240"," I know how that is."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5737240","5741240"," Is that, when I was learning on a trade, I was tipping people."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5741240","5746240"," When I was learning on a trade, I blew my money on bullshit classes."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5746240","5749240"," What burned my money on bullshit, trading rooms."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5750240","5754240"," They go in there and then nobody want to tell me how to do things, how to learn."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5754240","5756240"," They just giggled because they didn't know it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5756240","5760240"," They would giggle at me because they didn't understand a complex concept."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5760240","5763240"," And they would always explain it to me in a way that I couldn't understand it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5765240","5766240"," Yeah, that kind of shit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5766240","5767240"," I've been there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5769240","5770240"," Price target right there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5770240","5771240"," Boom, nailed it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5773240","5774240"," Four seventeen thirteen."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5774240","5776240"," First price target achieved."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5776240","5778240"," Now, do we get higher?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5778240","5780240"," Do we go to price target two at fourteen eighty one?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5781240","5783240"," That's your next question, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5785240","5790240"," Boom, bull flag traded up slap four seventeen thirteen."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5790240","5792240"," Question becomes, do we get it higher?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5796240","5797240"," Where do we go from there?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5797240","5799240"," This is a place to take some profit here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5799240","5801240"," You want to leave a couple runners on?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5801240","5803240"," You want to look for some support down below?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5804240","5806240"," It's at four sixteen sixteen."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5808240","5811240"," If you want to leave some runners to go up to, we said it was four eighteen."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5811240","5813240"," They're actually pushed up higher now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5814240","5815240"," Bears are like shit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5815240","5816240"," Four nineteen fifty."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5820240","5821240"," Four nineteen fifty."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5822240","5824240"," So right down here, you see the support down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5824240","5825240"," Four sixteen."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5825240","5826240"," What is that?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5827240","5828240"," Four sixteen thirty."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5828240","5829240"," Four sixteen twenty."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5832240","5833240"," Four sixteen twenty."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5833240","5834240"," Four sixteen twenty somewhere in there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5834240","5835240"," Right, we're going to move that up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5836240","5838240"," We're going to put some lines on the chart today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5839240","5840240"," Right down in here somewhere."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5841240","5842240"," A little bit of support down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5843240","5844240"," Right down here, some support."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5845240","5846240"," With that support down here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5847240","5848240"," We have that four eighteen eighty one."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5848240","5849240"," We have four nineteen above."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5850240","5851240"," So we're going to check that one more time."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5851240","5853240"," Look at that four nineteen fifty and four nineteen fifty."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5854240","5855240"," Four nineteen flat."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5856240","5857240"," We have a price target to here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5858240","5859240"," It's actually been pushed up higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5860240","5861240"," Four nineteen flat, actually."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5863240","5864240"," And there's four nineteen fifty over here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5865240","5866240"," So somewhere in somewhere."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5867240","5868240"," We're going to do that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5868240","5869240"," We're going to do this over here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5870240","5871240"," We're just going to do a box over here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5873240","5874240"," Right there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5874240","5875240"," There it is."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5876240","5877240"," We got first price target here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5878240","5879240"," We got next price target above."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5880240","5881240"," We know we got some firm support down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5882240","5883240"," Four sixteen."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5883240","5884240"," Intradate."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5884240","5885240"," Support down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5885240","5886240"," Four sixteen twenty thirty seven."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5886240","5887240"," Right."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5887240","5888240"," So what are we looking for?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5889240","5890240"," We're either looking for some support."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5891240","5892240"," Trade down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5892240","5893240"," Bam."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5894240","5895240"," Or."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5895240","5896240"," We're looking for rejection here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5897240","5898240"," Start trading it down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5899240","5900240"," And then bam."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5900240","5901240"," You get your next shot up out of here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5901240","5902240"," Okay."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5903240","5906240"," Get on that bearishness out of me this morning at the beginning of the morning."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5907240","5908240"," Get on that bearishness out of me."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5911240","5913240"," Get on that bearishness out of me for the morning."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5915240","5919240"," And then what we can do is we can do is we can come up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5921240","5922240"," Thank you, Jill."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5923240","5924240"," Yes, my love."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5925240","5926240"," It's okay again."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5926240","5927240"," I won my case."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5927240","5928240"," I'm surprised I won."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5928240","5929240"," Dude, I was."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5929240","5930240"," I can tell you what."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5930240","5933240"," I was like, there ain't no fucking way I'm going to win this shit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5933240","5934240"," I'm like, it's big, bad pay pal."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5936240","5937240"," I'll be honest with you."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5937240","5938240"," I was like, there ain't no fucking way."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5938240","5939240"," I even called up Joe Harper."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5939240","5940240"," I'm like, I'm totally fucked."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5941240","5942240"," I'm like, I am totally fucked here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5942240","5944240"," I'm like, I'm like, there's no way."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5944240","5948240"," Because dude, if you guys deal with banks or payer processes or any of that kind of stuff,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5949240","5953240"," it's like a dark black chasm that you never, you never climb out of."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5954240","5955240"," You never win that shit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5956240","5959240"," Even like, if you have a problem with any company, Amazon doesn't matter what it is,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5959240","5960240"," you're kind of fucked."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5961240","5962240"," Okay, so what are we going to look for here?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5963240","5966240"," If there is rejection, we're going to start drawing ourselves."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5966240","5968240"," We're going to start drawing our first line like that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5969240","5970240"," How do you get your second line?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5970240","5971240"," Well, we're going to make a parallel."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5973240","5974240"," Right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5974240","5975240"," Real simple stuff here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5976240","5977240"," Right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5978240","5979240"," Just like that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5981240","5982240"," We got our first price target, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5982240","5984240"," We're going to follow that, follow that down right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5984240","5985240"," We're going to look for it next one."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5986240","5987240"," Right down there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5988240","5989240"," So what do you do here?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5991240","5993240"," This is your, this is your cut your losses down here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5993240","5994240"," You don't want to be breaking this, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5994240","5996240"," We didn't break it down here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5997240","5998240"," You're looking for this to hold."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","5998240","6000240"," If this line right here holds, then I'm clicked on."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6001240","6003240"," If that holds, we're still bullish, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6003240","6004240"," We're still trading higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6005240","6008240"," Last thing we got to think about, it's now 1232 in the afternoon,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6008240","6009240"," digging around."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6010240","6014240"," Remember, we could get some weakness at 1.30, 2 o'clock, 2.30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6015240","6020240"," Otherwise, we're going to see if we can make another ripper here, a pyre."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6021240","6024240"," D-trading the spy, pumping and dumping the spy every day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6025240","6026240"," I love the fucking spy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6027240","6028240"," It's so easy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6030240","6031240"," So why work hard?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6033240","6034240"," I don't know why you'd work hard."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6036240","6037240"," This is no need."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6037240","6039240"," We'll see if we'll break through or if we're going to pull back here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6040240","6043240"," You can see here on this chart, there's a little bit of resistance here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6043240","6044240"," I want you to see that, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6044240","6047240"," There is still some resistance here at 4.17.13."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6048240","6050240"," There's still some resistance about 4.17.36."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6050240","6051240"," So if you're like, hey, Cap."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6052240","6054240"," If you're like, hey, Cap, we're going to break right out right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6054240","6056240"," We're not even going to turn around, Cap, for more support."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6056240","6058240"," We're not turning around, Cap, I promise."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6058240","6060240"," So you want to jump back into your trade?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6064240","6065240"," Well, on here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6066240","6067240"," Just give it a minute."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6067240","6069240"," Let it start here, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6070240","6071240"," And then take it, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6071240","6073240"," Just wait for this break above."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6074240","6077240"," Wait for the break above that volatility."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6078240","6079240"," You can jump right back in."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6082240","6084240"," Give some velocity to the move straight up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6089240","6091240"," Otherwise, you're buying again down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6092240","6093240"," Just as it heads up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6096240","6097240"," What are you saying?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6097240","6100240"," One time someone sent me a survey and a year-long nutrition coaching thing online,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6100240","6103240"," and I gave them a 6.10, and they refunded all of them money for the entire year."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6103240","6106240"," Sometimes companies are cool, and I felt bad because they used it a bunch."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6106240","6108240"," But I didn't ask them to refund me at all."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6111240","6113240"," Spy Pomp room, baby."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6117240","6118240"," I love you, Joe."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6118240","6119240"," I love you, Joe."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6125240","6126240"," Hey, Matt."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6126240","6127240"," Seven or eight."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6127240","6128240"," Thanks for lurking, brother."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6128240","6129240"," Appreciate you, too, my man."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6134240","6135240"," Right on, Will."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6139240","6140240"," I love you, Joe Harper."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6144240","6145240"," I love everybody out there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6146240","6147240"," Five bucks a dollar."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6147240","6148240"," I don't care."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6148240","6149240"," Just a like and a subscribe."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6149240","6150240"," I don't care."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6150240","6151240"," I appreciate that, too."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6160240","6161240"," Do you remember that shit?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6161240","6162240"," Yeah."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6162240","6163240"," I'll get in there, Cody."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6163240","6164240"," I got you covered."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6167240","6168240"," I got you covered, brother."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6168240","6175240"," I love all of you guys."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6175240","6176240"," Cap kicking ass again."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6176240","6177240"," Fuck, yeah."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6177240","6178240"," We're kicking ass again."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6178240","6179240"," Doing this shit every day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6179240","6188240"," I was talking about this with Chate and the other day and with Joe about how you can't"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6188240","6190240"," learn this shit by a video."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6190240","6191240"," Even a training class."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6191240","6192240"," I got a bunch of them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6192240","6193240"," I should post them for you guys."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6193240","6195240"," At Captain's Office so you can see what you pay for."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6195240","6196240"," I got a shit ton of them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6196240","6197240"," I actually have them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6197240","6200240"," I could host them somewhere and let you guys watch them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6200240","6201240"," They're a joke."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6201240","6206240"," How do you explain price action to someone in a training class?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6206240","6208240"," I don't know how you do that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6208240","6211240"," You get in one every single day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6211240","6216240"," You're literally every day sitting here with me and you're getting one of them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6216240","6219240"," You're literally sitting here with me and you're getting one of them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6219240","6223240"," You're literally sitting here with me and you're getting one every single day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6223240","6225240"," Am I going to be right all the time?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6225240","6226240"," No, but it doesn't matter."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6226240","6231240"," What matters is that you've got someone sitting next to you talking about price action,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6231240","6236240"," talking about where the market's currently going, talking about current events, market"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6236240","6239240"," sentiments, and setups."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6239240","6243240"," Where are the setups at?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6243240","6244240"," Looks like this is going to bust through."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6244240","6245240"," It looks like it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6245240","6246240"," I don't know here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6246240","6248240"," We'll check here and see if it's going to break through or not."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6248240","6250240"," A lot of sellers still here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6250240","6252240"," Be careful here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6252240","6254240"," If you are still in right now, you have another chance though."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6254240","6258240"," You could dime and hand this to break through and then if it bounces back down,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6258240","6263240"," you add to your position to get up to 419."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6263240","6266240"," You can't teach this shit in a video."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6266240","6267240"," You can't."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6267240","6270240"," You cannot."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6270240","6273240"," But of course, if you're a new investor or trainer, you suck up those videos and you're like,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6273240","6277240"," okay, I compare it to skiing."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6277240","6279240"," I always compare it to skiing."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6279240","6283240"," If I made you a video on how to ski, I used to teach skiing."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6283240","6286240"," I even taught adaptive skiing at a time."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6286240","6288240"," That was on a ski team for a long time."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6288240","6289240"," Pretty good skier."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6289240","6291240"," I lived in a mountain town for a long time."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6291240","6297240"," I could make you, I could close my eyes and make you a ski video on how to ski, learn how to ski."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6297240","6300240"," You see these sellers here that are coming down now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6300240","6302240"," They're getting feisty."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6303240","6305240"," Just take 4-17-35."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6305240","6309240"," I would recommend at this point, you take money off the table."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6309240","6311240"," These sellers weren't here before."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6311240","6318240"," We can go to 419-50, but they're coming down now for you, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6318240","6320240"," They are coming down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6320240","6321240"," I spent a little bit of time here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6321240","6322240"," They're going to come down there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6322240","6327240"," They're starting to get violent up in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6327240","6328240"," We're losing runway too."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6328240","6329240"," It's 12-37."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6329240","6332240"," We have an hour left until some real volatility."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6332240","6337240"," There are some spied buyers coming in right now that is contrarian to what I'm telling you right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6337240","6341240"," But this gets very risky where we are."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6341240","6344240"," Risk is high."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6344240","6347240"," If you and I were out there skiing, right, when you and I spent like a week skiing together,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6347240","6350240"," you'd be up and skiing quite well."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6350240","6356240"," You'd be competent to at least ski greens, green circles in a week."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6356240","6358240"," It was every day for a week."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6358240","6364240"," If I skied with you all season, you'd be skiing bumps on blue squares with intermediate trails"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6364240","6375240"," by end of season and getting scared on simple black diamonds and stuff."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6375240","6380240"," I don't think you can pay for a class for that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6380240","6383240"," I don't think that money is there in a class."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6383240","6385240"," Some of it is for fundamentals."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6385240","6390240"," But if you really want those fundamentals, why buy it?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6390240","6392240"," You just go to the options industry council."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6392240","6395240"," They're free."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6395240","6397240"," Optionsindustrycouncil.org."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6397240","6400240"," The CME puts it out."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6400240","6404240"," Starting to squeeze higher now, going to $4.19.50 is the price target above here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6404240","6411240"," Currently trading at $4.17.55.56 on the spy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6411240","6418240"," Bear's coming in trying to hold off here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6418240","6428240"," But if you really want the fundamentals, the options industry council has videos backed by the CME."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6428240","6431240"," So you know you're not getting their dry."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6431240","6438240"," It's like swallowing like a peanut butter sandwich in a desert."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6438240","6444240"," But if you want the fundamentals of the market, that's your answer."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6444240","6449240"," You don't need to be paying somebody $600 a month."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6449240","6455240"," And not having them there every day of the week."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6455240","6459240"," We've got moderators here like Winky and Josh, your wife's boyfriend."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6459240","6466240"," We've got some people inside the Discord, gangster trainers, straight gangsters."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6466240","6470240"," Always dropping bombs."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6470240","6471240"," Bombs."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6471240","6477240"," Free."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6477240","6482240"," Like straight bombs."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6641240","6644240"," Some support right there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6645240","6653240"," The price target above is still $4.95."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6653240","6656240"," See if the bulls can hold on to it."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6666240","6672240"," Keep your eyes on the clock as we head into the FOMC statement."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6672240","6682240"," Don't want to get caught up here trying to fuck around and have some volatility into the market. Keep your eyes on the VIX."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6682240","6692240"," VIX is bottoming out around 428.45 right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6692240","6704240"," A beautiful thing is I gotta draw some, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta pencil, I gotta crayon scratch some, uh, some levels down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6704240","6713240"," We'll do that together real quick. Real simple stuff, right? No rocket scientists, we don't need to be rocket scientists, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6713240","6718240"," Another one down in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6718240","6723240"," This would be where the break is, right? Where your free fall down in the VIX."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6723240","6727240"," This would be kind of like the last place for the, this would be the VIX holdouts."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6727240","6734240"," If you're a, if you're a VIX bull, this is where the stops are."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6734240","6739240"," For VIX bulls."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6739240","6743240"," Three of squeeze right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6748240","6759240"," Huge bid in the market right now. Huge bid in the market right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6759240","6770240"," Huge bid."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6771240","6783240"," Huge. They were buyers. They were buyers this market as we went down. I want to show you this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6783240","6794240"," We can show this in a better, uh, I mean, this is horrible. Look at all that mess down there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6794240","6799240"," I need a different chart to show you guys. Let me show you a different chart a lot."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6799240","6803240"," Trying to scale out of this shit. That's awesome. Horrible looking charting."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6803240","6808240"," I gotta go back and delete a bunch of this shit. I tried to leave it on there as long as I can so that, uh,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6808240","6813240"," so they can go back and see where I failed and where I was successful."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6813240","6817240"," It's like a, it's like a, it's like a diary."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6817240","6823240"," So we're going to take a look at, um, the different chart here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6823240","6841240"," I'm going to use the spy specifically today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6841240","6844240"," A larger timeframe. This is the spy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6844240","6852240"," And we're going to add the market breath indicator. Most of you know what this is."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6852240","6863240"," So you don't use the ice man ran one open source, which is awesome guy after my own heart."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6863240","6866240"," Tied nothing by the paywall."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6866240","6871240"," We'll let this load up and see."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6871240","6876240"," Buyer stepping in, pushing up, right? We're not added in decision candle anymore."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6876240","6881240"," Currently, at least markets being bought right. Market bought here. Market, market bought here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6881240","6887240"," Same thing currently happening right now in the spy on a daily chart, at least."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6887240","6893240"," Let this load up. It's starting to load up, right? We dipped way down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6893240","6898240"," To the depths of hell in the market breath indicator. You can see that the market's being bought right now, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6898240","6902240"," Buying this market. It's supposed to be the most volatile day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6902240","6911240"," And yet people are buying here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6911240","6915240"," Telling a different story."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6915240","6923240"," And what we're being fed."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6923240","6942240"," Buyers down below to $4.14.96. That would be the deepest weakness that you would see right now. $4.14.90."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6942240","6952240"," Give you some key levels here, okay? Key levels. $4.16.14. And $4.15.42."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6952240","6958240"," You can see the sellers swooping in right now. They're still above at $4.19.50. They haven't swooped in yet."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6958240","6967240"," But they are getting a little aggressive here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6968240","6971240"," This is the same candlestick chart down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6971240","6977240"," So $4.14 down in here. This is where the bulls are at down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6977240","6986240"," Key support right where we are right now. And then don't forget down here is kind of key over here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6986240","6991240"," Yeah, somewhere in this area here and here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6991240","6999240"," And some key support key. Actually, we just had our key taken away from us right now, didn't we?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","6999240","7008240"," Trying to tell people they can't have abortions and stuff. Tell you what, regardless of what side of the political spectrum you're on,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7008240","7017240"," you don't want women to get together. Try telling women you're going to control their bodies and stuff."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7017240","7026240"," What? They lock that shit up and they lock that shit up right in."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7026240","7036240"," Men are going to be in for a rude awakening. Rude. Men can be stupid as fuck. Stupid."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7036240","7044240"," I don't know how many of you are in a relationship out there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7044240","7052240"," As I've grown older, I have learned that it's better to pick your battles."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7052240","7058240"," That doesn't mean that you or your wife chooses to do those things or not or whoever."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7058240","7061240"," But even in those relationships, doesn't matter if you're for or against it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7061240","7070240"," But just in any relationship. Or at least for me and my experience with most women."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7070240","7076240"," They prefer that I stay out of certain things. It's none of my business."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7076240","7083240"," I kind of like that. It kind of works for me. I've had best success that way."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7083240","7088240"," So if I have to win something, I'll make that known. I'll be like, hey, I got to win this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7088240","7091240"," Especially when I meet them, right? I got to win this or I got to win that or whatever."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7091240","7099240"," But there's some shit I don't get involved in. None of my fucking business."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7099240","7103240"," I heard somebody yesterday said what we should do is we should we should."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7103240","7109240"," We should give every young boy a we're going to snip their balls of vasectomy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7109240","7114240"," When they're of age, just snip their balls. And then you let them then you find out if they want to make babies or something."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7114240","7121240"," I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't do that shit. And my wife was like, what do you mean we can't do that shit to you?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7121240","7126240"," I was like, yeah, you got a point. I don't want to fuck with my body."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7127240","7131240"," I'm like, I don't want you making decisions for me. Sound familiar?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7133240","7137240"," Doesn't matter what your take is on it either. Just matters, you know, my business or not."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7137240","7141240"," Here we go. We might have another, we might have another rip higher here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7141240","7143240"," Coming up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7143240","7148240"," And I'm like, no, I don't want anything to do with that shit. I don't know my business."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7150240","7152240"," Right in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7153240","7157240"," Let's see if this rolls over if this is a nice play here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7157240","7162240"," 430 C's are now 83 cents. They were down to like 50s, right? 30s."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7162240","7165240"," Now getting some call premium built into them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7165240","7171240"," 430 C's were down to like, what? 40 cents? They're now up to 85 cents."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7171240","7174240"," Expiring on Friday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7174240","7180240"," Almost double. Almost at 100%."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7180240","7183240"," Almost double."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7189240","7191240"," Yeah."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7195240","7198240"," Yeah, I mean, I mean, honestly, I feel like him."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7198240","7202240"," I'm anti doing, I'm anti abortion, wherever I'm like, good, great."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7202240","7207240"," We just, I understand. I just, I don't get involved with that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7207240","7212240"," I'm trying to, with women and shit like that, I'm just, what am I, what am I fucking business?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7212240","7218240"," I couldn't imagine like, I couldn't imagine like someone trying to tell me as a man,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7218240","7223240"," you have to get a vasectomy 18 years old. That shit ain't happening."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7223240","7226240"," That shit ain't happening."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7226240","7230240"," You know what I mean? You guys get what I'm saying here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7232240","7235240"," Boom. See if that happens."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7237240","7241240"," They're trying. Bulls are trying. Be careful of this if this is a double top,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7241240","7243240"," but this is a lot of strength here. Just heads up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7243240","7247240"," A ton of strength here. 1253. Have an hour left."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7247240","7251240"," Bulls want to get up to 4, 4, 19, 90. Building some support here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7251240","7254240"," We are building some support. Whether you like this or not, this is becoming support."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7254240","7256240"," This is nice to see."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7256240","7260240"," Nice little, nice little bull flag once again above, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7260240","7264240"," We're going to leave this one here in case there's a bounce lower."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7265240","7267240"," Okay, so some weakness here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7267240","7270240"," We'll just leave that one there just in case."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7271240","7275240"," Just leave behind a path of writing on."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7275240","7277240"," We're going to look up a little bit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7277240","7280240"," It's nice to see right there. It's always good to see."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7281240","7283240"," We'll look up higher a little bit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7284240","7289240"," And see if we're coming into this. See if we see this here. Let's look at this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7290240","7293240"," You see, look back here. You got 4, 18, 93 here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7293240","7296240"," You've got a top above here at 4, 18, 47."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7297240","7299240"," We'll draw a little line in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7302240","7303240"," It's getting messy already."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7307240","7310240"," It's getting messy already. I can already see it's getting messy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7315240","7318240"," See if we can blast this higher. Get up to that price target."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7318240","7320240"," 4, 19, 50 is where we're going."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7320240","7322240"," 4, 19, 50."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7323240","7336240"," Yeah, I don't understand it out. I don't want to get involved in it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7346240","7348240"," Now, trading 4, 17, 72."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7349240","7351240"," New high on the day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7352240","7357240"," This little line right here. This is the previous plane of rejection up here, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7357240","7360240"," Things are going to get dangerous as we come up into these levels here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7361240","7363240"," They will get dangerous as we get up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7363240","7365240"," Point of rejection yesterday as well."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7365240","7368240"," Two times we sold off right in this area here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7372240","7374240"," Start singing highway to the danger zone up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7376240","7379240"," Highway to the danger zone."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7380240","7385240"," 4, 17, 96. Now, 4, 18. Slamming it up at 4, 18."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7385240","7386240"," 4, 18, 0, 4."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7390240","7391240"," Very nice."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7393240","7396240"," Very nice. Broke through. This broke some shorts."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7397240","7400240"," Some shorts were just broken there for a moment."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7400240","7403240"," Look at that. Just smash it on shorts in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7404240","7409240"," Just slamming up. This triggered some closing of shorts here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7411240","7412240"," Nasty."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7414240","7419240"," Nasty reaction at that level at 4, 18, 0, 4. Nasty."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7421240","7422240"," Rage."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7423240","7427240"," Bear rage here. Slapping it up there. 4, 18, 0, 8."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7427240","7429240"," Quick, quick, quick."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7434240","7438240"," I have to try to like slide that over there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7442240","7444240"," Violent moves heading up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7444240","7446240"," Bid coming into the market across the board."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7446240","7448240"," We got spy call buyers. They don't care."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7448240","7450240"," They're like, we don't care. We're going up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7450240","7454240"," We got apple buyers and video buyers."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7454240","7457240"," JPM buyers. What else we got over here?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7457240","7458240"," Pro buyers."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7459240","7462240"," Spy cues. Tesla buyers."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7464240","7466240"," Spy in the index today. They don't care right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7466240","7468240"," If I was a bear, I'd be scared here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7470240","7472240"," Buyers all over the place in the market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7472240","7474240"," Heading higher here. Trying to trade up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7474240","7477240"," Let's get that price started. Let's get 4, 19, 50."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7724240","7726240"," they have to actually buy the market here"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7726240","7728240"," so they don't lose money."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7728240","7730240"," They have to buy the market here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7730240","7731240"," This is what happens."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7767240","7769240"," They're losing money out there right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7769240","7773240"," Anyone that was short is now has to flip and buy the market."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7790240","7791240"," Get it up there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7791240","7792240"," Push it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7793240","7795240"," Send those fucking spy calls in."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7795240","7798240"," I see them in the options flow."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7828240","7830240"," Now up to 4 20."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7830240","7832240"," Forget 1950."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7832240","7834240"," Look at 4 20."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7837240","7838240"," Right up in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7839240","7840240"," I should say it's here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7840240","7841240"," It's here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7841240","7842240"," Resistance is 4 20."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7842240","7844240"," On a small and a small and a bigger chart."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7844240","7846240"," That's what gets all weird up there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7846240","7847240"," Try in the middle."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7847240","7849240"," 4 18 47."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7851240","7853240"," See we got going on here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7853240","7854240"," Blasting."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7854240","7855240"," Blasting."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7855240","7856240"," Blasting."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7857240","7858240"," What support?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7858240","7860240"," This line right here becomes support."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7860240","7861240"," We know that right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7861240","7863240"," We know this line becomes support here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7863240","7866240"," This line they want to turn into support."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7868240","7869240"," Why?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7869240","7871240"," Because this was resistance yesterday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7880240","7882240"," You want to turn this into support here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7882240","7883240"," Why do you want to turn this into support?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7884240","7886240"," Because resistance becomes support."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7889240","7890240"," So we want to see this here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7890240","7891240"," Hold."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7894240","7896240"," We want to see something in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7896240","7897240"," Hold."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7897240","7899240"," Okay, we want to see this hold in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7900240","7902240"," If this doesn't hold."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7903240","7905240"," We will roll it down, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7905240","7906240"," We want this to hold."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7906240","7908240"," We don't want a rejection here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7909240","7912240"," We want a rejection look like something like this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7913240","7914240"," And then down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7915240","7917240"," We don't want to see that, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7918240","7920240"," We don't want to see that here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7925240","7927240"," So close to where we're going."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7930240","7931240"," We'll leave right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7931240","7933240"," I want to turn that into support."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7933240","7938240"," That would be kind of crude futures extending gains up more than 5% when a 7 is about 56."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7938240","7939240"," We're going to tag down below."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7940240","7942240"," They want to push it down here so bad."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7942240","7943240"," They want to turn this in."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7943240","7944240"," They want to roll this over."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7944240","7946240"," This is the resistance from yesterday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7946240","7947240"," You guys remember, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7947240","7949240"," See the angle on this right here?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7950240","7951240"," You want to roll this over."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7951240","7952240"," This is what Bear wants."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7952240","7954240"," It doesn't get bearish for a minute."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7954240","7956240"," Bear is like, we want to send it down here, Cap."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7957240","7958240"," Then we want to bounce it twice."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7958240","7960240"," I want to send this thing down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7961240","7962240"," Bear is like, what time is it right now?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7962240","7964240"," We got like 55 minutes left."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7964240","7965240"," All these bulls are buying this shit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7965240","7966240"," I don't believe it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7967240","7968240"," They're doing 75 VPS."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7968240","7970240"," We just wanted a better positioning cap."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7972240","7973240"," So we let the bulls take it up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7973240","7977240"," Now we're going to send it lower into the decision."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7978240","7980240"," This is what the Bears want."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7982240","7983240"," That's what we are right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7983240","7984240"," Bear is like getting up there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7984240","7986240"," He ain't getting here for 1950, buddy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7987240","7988240"," So we're going to watch this right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7988240","7990240"," See how they're trying to push right now?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7990240","7991240"," Push, push, push."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7992240","7994240"," So we're going to watch and see these sellers."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7995240","7997240"," And we've got some prior supports back here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","7997240","7999240"," So we'll keep an eye on this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8004240","8005240"," Right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8006240","8008240"," Even though we didn't trade in here, this is a prior sport,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8008240","8009240"," believe it or not."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8009240","8011240"," This is a power move up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8012240","8015240"," So you don't use the lube when you say, nope, we're going higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8015240","8016240"," This is a powerful move right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8016240","8017240"," Very powerful."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8018240","8022240"," So we're going to see if these bears are here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8022240","8025240"," If we lost our runway, giant sellers up here, you see this?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8025240","8027240"," Sellers here, big ones."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8027240","8028240"," Pretty big sellers here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8031240","8032240"," Try to tell you no."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8033240","8035240"," Try to tell you to take the money and go."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8036240","8037240"," Take the money and run."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8040240","8042240"," Let's look and see if we can find where real support is in the market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8043240","8047240"," Let's look and see if we can find where real support is in the market right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8047240","8048240"," Whoa."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8049240","8051240"," No, we don't get crazy with it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8051240","8052240"," Hold on."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8058240","8060240"," Let's see where real support is."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8060240","8063240"," I want to make sure we don't get rug pulled in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8067240","8069240"," We don't want to get a rug pull here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8073240","8075240"," So VWAP is pretty much where it's at, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8075240","8076240"," 416."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8079240","8081240"," So if you're still long right now, let's talk about that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8084240","8087240"," If you're still long right now, if you're like, fuck that cap, I'm staying long."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8088240","8090240"," This VWAP right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8090240","8092240"," I'm going to take a look at it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8093240","8095240"," So here's VWAP right here, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8095240","8099240"," So what you're going to do is a pull, if you're long here, if you let some runners on, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8099240","8101240"," You leave the runners on here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8102240","8105240"," This is going to be, you know, if you wanted to dip by, it's here."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8109240","8113240"," If you're a bear, you're looking for a force, a break of this zone here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8114240","8115240"," This zone we have."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8116240","8120240"," Now if you're a bear, so what you want to be doing is you want to be seeing the trade down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8120240","8122240"," Does it matter if it's here or does it matter if it's here?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8123240","8125240"," You want to see the swing high, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8126240","8127240"," All right."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8127240","8130240"," And then a sell down or even two is even better."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8130240","8136240"," What you'll have it up doing is you'll have getting one, two, and then a move down to lower loads."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8139240","8140240"," How far do we go?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8140240","8142240"," Probably today, not lower than 415."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8144240","8146240"," Let's do some real panic selling down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8146240","8149240"," I'm taking my money and running and waiting for a lot of bulls are like, hey, I made this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8149240","8150240"," Made us money here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8150240","8152240"," Made a ton of money here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8152240","8155240"," And I'm going to take money and wait for FMC."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8155240","8157240"," Day traders probably do that as well."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8157240","8161240"," So be aware of this as we go down into FMC."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8161240","8162240"," It's 108."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8162240","8168240"," We've got only 52 minutes left until the, at least the statement."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8168240","8172240"," So you can just, you expect some volatility in here heading down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8173240","8175240"," But even if we do get this volatility, there could be a chance."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8175240","8179240"," Let's say you're a bear bull right now and you're like, oh shit, then Cap might cut my losses."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8179240","8181240"," There should be one more chance for you."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8182240","8184240"," They usually pump at least one more time."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8186240","8192240"," And then as we go to, so we're expecting and looking out into the two o'clock hour for the, the fed statement, right for FMC."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8193240","8195240"," Nice little push higher here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8195240","8196240"," This is beautiful."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8197240","8203240"," If you're long right here and you want to take your profit, there's a chance we might come back up one more time that you could pull the profit from that trade."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8204240","8206240"," Now also within that, we might trade right through it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8206240","8210240"," We have had prior FMCs where literally we go right through it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8213240","8223240"," So pick your poison bid in the market guaranteed calls a few days out, catching a bid right now and just premium in a reversal in the market."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8730360","8736040"," and you can speed up the broadcast so that it's real time i'll sound kind of funny and stream"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8736120","8741880"," like i'm speaking really fast and then after about 15 seconds i will catch up to you by just a few"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8741880","8747240"," seconds youtube puts a natural buffer on your side of the stream"

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8805960","8811960"," to the news as well their take is it bullish bearish or neutral so we can usually get it really"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8811960","8817400"," fast we'll get it just an answer is it bullish or is it hawkish is davish is it neutral before"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8817400","8823080"," it hits twitter so it's usually like anywhere from not always sometimes they miss they they won't"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8823160","8829960"," get the information quick enough but oftentimes in days like today they will get and be able to"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8829960","8836760"," interpret before you get the news on twitter and you'll hear it here on our broadcast at 2 p.m"

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8879160","8884200"," you should have a reaction or be able to have a reaction to the market before it actually"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8884200","8891080"," happens in your candlestick charts usually it's about a five to ten or to fifteen second reaction"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","8891800","8898040"," so if you line if you're long this market you can line up a sell to to sell your shit if you need"

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12269480","12272480"," We talked this morning about the presser"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12272480","12275480"," that we talked in the morning during the about the presser"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12275480","12279480"," that oftentimes the presser will begin positive."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12281480","12284480"," And then you'll get a reporter that will press"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12284480","12286480"," on certain questions."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12287480","12291480"," So I'm going to review this aspect of the day"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12291480","12293480"," together with you once more."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12294480","12298480"," Reporters will likely press Chairman Powell"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12298480","12301480"," about the cadence of rate hikes for the rest of the year."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12302480","12305480"," And on whether any tea leaves of easing inflation"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12305480","12309480"," might alter the course that the Fed has laid out for rates."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12309480","12312480"," It's unlikely that they will be able to nail him down"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12312480","12315480"," on whether one or more additional 50 basis point"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12315480","12319480"," hikes could be coming this year as he continues"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12319480","12322480"," to stress the need for nimble policy,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12322480","12325480"," which could include more half point moves."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12325480","12330480"," The surprise negative readings for advanced Q1 GDP"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12330480","12333480"," could also raise questions about how aggressive the Fed can be"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12333480","12336480"," in taking rates to neutral and beyond."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12338480","12342480"," Also note that the last time we had 50 BPS rate hikes"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12342480","12344480"," by the Fed was in the year 2000."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12344480","12346480"," And this will be the first time since 2006"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12346480","12350480"," that the Fed has raised rates at two consecutive meetings."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12350480","12353480"," So the question then becomes in the side of this presser,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12353480","12357480"," hey, boss, are you doing, you're getting aggressive here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12357480","12362480"," Are you still considering being aggressive in coming"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12362480","12364480"," Fed meetings?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12364480","12367480"," So you're looking to see in that in that presser,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12367480","12370480"," you're looking to see pretty much two verbiages."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12370480","12373480"," You're looking for, you're looking for, well,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12373480","12378480"," we'll look at it as it comes down the road for no."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12380480","12381480"," He was like, fuck no."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12381480","12383480"," He's like, we're sticking to our guns."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12383480","12385480"," Point blank said it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12385480","12387480"," No matter what, if we peaked inflation,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12387480","12388480"," I know you guys don't believe that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12388480","12390480"," I'm not saying it has either."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12390480","12394480"," But he said it, even if March was peak inflation,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12394480","12397480"," he said we're going to stick to our guns."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12397480","12399480"," He's going to stay the course."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12399480","12402480"," If he says in this presser,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12402480","12404480"," we're staying the course, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12404480","12410480"," If he says something like that in this presser at 2 at 2.30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12414480","12416480"," If he says that at 2.30, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12416480","12422480"," You can forget for 15 and 4.10 and start looking for."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12422480","12424480"," We're right down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12428480","12429480"," Come on there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12430480","12433480"," Price target by May 4th."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12433480","12435480"," 4,000."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12435480","12437480"," Now even if we trade down here,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12437480","12439480"," we get a bearish fed president."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12439480","12442480"," He's like, we're staying the course no matter what."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12442480","12445480"," And we trade down here to 4,000."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12445480","12447480"," I'm buying that dip."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12447480","12450480"," Okay, so we've talked about that all morning long."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12450480","12451480"," We've talked about that all week long."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12451480","12453480"," We've talked about it the past two weeks,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12453480","12454480"," past three weeks."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12454480","12456480"," As a matter of fact, this price target by May 4th,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12456480","12458480"," we've been up here for two, three weeks."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12458480","12461480"," So if we get that today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12467480","12473480"," If you get a bullish fed for our dovish fed presser,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12473480","12475480"," that's your dip right there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12477480","12480480"," If you get Jay Powell, the bear,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12480480","12485480"," he's like, just like it was at the world economic"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12485480","12486480"," platform, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12486480","12490480"," We have tons of UVXY puts coming in right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12490480","12496480"," To 15 May 6th, 15 P racks and racks of them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12497480","12500480"," Racks and racks of UVXY puts coming in right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12500480","12507480"," May 6th, 15 P loads, boatloads."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12509480","12513480"," So there's a swing trade right there for Friday, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12514480","12520480"," If the Fed Chair says we'll assess it as we go along,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12520480","12523480"," you're going to get this trade right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12524480","12529480"," If he says to you though, fuck the equities market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12531480","12533480"," You're going to get a bloodbath down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12533480","12534480"," Now, if you get a bloodbath down here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12534480","12536480"," Let's say you get the bloodbath down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12536480","12539480"," Then we head down to 405 or 4000 or something like that, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12539480","12543480"," You switch from buying zero dates to buying some spreads"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12543480","12548480"," and you're looking for where's the next large put opex?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12548480","12552480"," We know that that or put a concentration on a single expiry."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12552480","12555480"," That's on May 20th."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12555480","12569480"," So you've got May 20th right over here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12569480","12571480"," See it right there?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12571480","12575480"," So that would imply if you get the bearish fed,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12575480","12581480"," you're going to swing down, swing up, and then back down into the expiry."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12581480","12584480"," So you can put some call spreads here or you make them"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12584480","12590480"," after like a week or so after and we'll probably swing high off those call spreads"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12590480","12593480"," off those puts expiring down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12593480","12595480"," Make sense?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12597480","12600480"," And eight minutes left until the presser starts."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12600480","12603480"," One last note on the presser would be..."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12606480","12609480"," One last note on the presser would be..."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12610480","12613480"," That the..."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12615480","12618480"," Hold on here, what am I thinking?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12620480","12623480"," One last note of the presser would be..."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12625480","12630480"," That oftentimes the presser could come out as being dovish or neutral."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12631480","12634480"," We'll praise it as we go along down the road."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12634480","12637480"," We haven't made any commitments yet."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12638480","12640480"," If that happens, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12640480","12644480"," Sometimes at the end of these pressers, they'll hold back like a..."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12644480","12648480"," They'll hold back the... not the worst, but the deep questions to the end."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12648480","12651480"," So if you sit in here and you'll be like,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12651480","12653480"," you'll be like, yeah, the presser's going pretty good."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12653480","12656480"," I'm going to buy this dip and it'll start rising."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12656480","12659480"," And then at the end, some asshole, not an asshole, but some real guy,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12659480","12661480"," somebody or woman or whatever, it doesn't matter."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12661480","12665480"," We'll kind of be like, yeah, but what about this and what about that?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12665480","12667480"," And it will dip one more time."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12667480","12671480"," So keep this in mind as you take this trade, that even though..."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12671480","12676480"," Even if he's uncommitted to aggressive and aggressive stance..."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12679480","12680480"," That he can..."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12680480","12685480"," They can quickly turn sour when you're not paying attention in the presser."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12686480","12697480"," There's that support down there at 4.16 and at 4.15 down below."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12697480","12701480"," That same place down here at 4.16, caught a bounce."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12703480","12706480"," Still watching the buyers down below at 4.15."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12709480","12711480"," Strong support, then 4.10 is next."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12716480","12719480"," Six more minutes until that presser begins."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12726480","12729480"," We'll wait and see if we get a little bit of rug pull coming out."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12729480","12733480"," If you want to keep your eyes open down below, you'll see the support level start to trail lower."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12733480","12736480"," You'll start to see pressure from bears above."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12736480","12739480"," You'll start to see these red, this red side get larger."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12739480","12741480"," You'll see the sellers overwhelm the buyers."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12741480","12743480"," Buyers are in control right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12746480","12754480"," I still got my eyes on those 430Cs."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12757480","12759480"," They're now down to 82 cents."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12759480","12762480"," That's where they started the day off at, I think."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12762480","12764480"," I think they started like 89 cents."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12764480","12766480"," They went as low as 50 cents."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12770480","12773480"," So I might re-enter that trade one more time here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12775480","12777480"," The trade is fast, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12777480","12779480"," The trade is very fast."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12790480","12792480"," The trade is gonna be quick."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12794480","12795480"," It's gonna be fast."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12806480","12815480"," This is that 416 level down here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12815480","12819480"," Soup that we still haven't done the 415 level down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12823480","12825480"," Nice little recovery here too, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12825480","12827480"," Breaking above, trying to recover it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12827480","12829480"," We'll see if we red bar it down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12829480","12831480"," I still haven't entered the next trade yet."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12877480","12880480"," A lot of traffic and a lot of danger in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12886480","12888480"," You're gonna try it again though."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12893480","12897480"," Yeah, they're right there."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12902480","12904480"," I'm trying to stop it right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12907480","12909480"," 419.82."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12910480","12913480"," My cursor is 419.82."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12923480","12926480"," I also have 420.65 above."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12934480","12939480"," A choppy trade here continuing U.S. equity markets pushing back towards the post def 1c announcement."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12939480","12942480"," Hi, the S&P minis at 4197."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12942480","12947480"," We topped out at 4270.75 just after the announcement."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12947480","12950480"," 1460 points."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12950480","12952480"," Diamond hands baby."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12952480","12954480"," 210 year spread is wider."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12954480","12959480"," We've seen some modest deepening along the U.S. treasury curve at about 20 basis points down to 210 spread."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12959480","12963480"," We're at 17 or so on that spread heading into the announcement."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12977480","12979480"," Thank you very much, Obie."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12979480","12982480"," Hell yeah, I bear appreciation today, brother. I got you."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12982480","12984480"," I appreciate the support."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12984480","12985480"," Jill, thank you for the support."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12985480","12987480"," Rick's, thank you for subscribing."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12987480","12990480"," So I'm over here watching the price action here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12992480","12995480"," 419.25. 421."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","12995480","13008480"," You can see what I'm seeing over here when I'm trying to watch over here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13015480","13018480"," Just remember this was resistance here from yesterday, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13018480","13020480"," This line right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13021480","13022480"," Trade above it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13022480","13023480"," Pushed it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13023480","13025480"," Come back down slamming, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13025480","13027480"," What does this usually lead to, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13027480","13028480"," You got one, two."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13028480","13031480"," You don't want to see two rejections here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13039480","13042480"," More UV X, Y puts coming in 5, 6, 15 P."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13042480","13044480"," They are rolling in, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13044480","13045480"," Stupid."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13045480","13048480"," Stupid right now, UV X, Y puts."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13049480","13051480"," Implication is that the market's going higher with those."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13051480","13053480"," Well, I guess it doesn't matter if the market goes higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13053480","13056480"," The market trade sideways, UV X, Y is still going to work."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13056480","13058480"," It's not going to matter too much."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13060480","13063480"," If you wanted to take this trade higher as a bull, what are you waiting for?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13063480","13065480"," I told you this earlier, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13065480","13070480"," I said, take the money and run at 420 and look, you're looking for two places to go long."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13070480","13073480"," Either above 420 to go higher, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13073480","13076480"," That's where we break through some resistance, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13076480","13081480"," Create some support and take this to 430, or you're looking for lower prices."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13081480","13084480"," So those lower prices, where are they, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13084480","13086480"," We know we've got support at 416."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13086480","13090480"," We've got some major buyers down below it, 415."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13090480","13094480"," And if that support leaves heading into the presser,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13094480","13099480"," we'll be looking down here for 410 as the deepest it should go."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13099480","13101480"," Unless the Fed is hawkish."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13101480","13105480"," If the Fed is hawkish, then you'll be buying some call spreads down below it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13105480","13108480"," You'll be buying some call spreads down at 4050."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13112480","13114480"," Chairman Powell, beginning his remarks,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13114480","13118480"," saying he's speaking directly to the American people that inflation is too high"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13118480","13121480"," and they're moving expeditiously to move inflation down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13129480","13131480"," Wild price action in the options chain two."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13131480","13132480"," Wild."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13132480","13133480"," Straight."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13133480","13134480"," Wild."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13134480","13137480"," Wild pricing in the options chain."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13137480","13140480"," Watching 100% swings in options."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13140480","13143480"," Powell not in the labor market, or me, is extremely tight."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13143480","13148480"," Well, the same inflation is much too high."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13148480","13150480"," This is that 415 level."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13150480","13158480"," This is the lowest."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13158480","13161480"," It's much too high."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13161480","13163480"," This is that 415 level."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13163480","13166480"," This is the last place for bull standing over here, 416."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13166480","13168480"," If not, we break down to 412."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13168480","13171480"," This is like last, last standing down in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13171480","13175480"," If you break this 415, we are going down to 412."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13175480","13177480"," This would make a major level for you, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13177480","13181480"," You'd end up seeing something like a break below."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13181480","13182480"," Tap, tap."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13182480","13187480"," We're back down to 412 and more than likely down to 410."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13188480","13191480"," I don't see an underlying momentum in the economy, it remains strong."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13191480","13193480"," This is your support area here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13193480","13196480"," 415, 416, somewhere in here is your support."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13196480","13200480"," You don't want to see a break below this and head lower."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13200480","13204480"," Stops for bulls are down here at 415."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13208480","13211480"," Have spy puts coming across the board right now for the bears."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13211480","13213480"," Bears are by my amount of kinds of TQQ."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13213480","13214480"," They're buying spy puts."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13214480","13219480"," 5, 4, 4, 12, P, 416, P, expiring on the 4th."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13219480","13225480"," Today, TQQ puts 5, 6, 38, P, rashers of them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13225480","13227480"," Bears are getting barren."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13227480","13229480"," Bears are like, I'm tuning into kept."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13229480","13230480"," Jimmy said 412."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","13230480","13233480"," I'm going to give you some 412 P's because we're going there."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14263480","14264480"," They're not asking."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14264480","14269480"," They become unanchored and they aren't seeing any much in the way of evidence of that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14269480","14270480"," They cannot risk it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14270480","14273480"," They're the engineer down below telling you can't do it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14273480","14274480"," And what are we doing?"

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14346480","14347480"," Who's got the proof?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14347480","14349480"," Charging you $600 for alpha every month."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14349480","14351480"," $1000 for alpha every month."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14351480","14352480"," Get out of here."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14356480","14360480"," They're probably watching this for alpha so they can pipe it into their friends."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14360480","14362480"," That's what they're doing."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14362480","14380480"," That was a kick ass trade down there."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14396480","14399480"," The 430 C's are now $1.66."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14399480","14405480"," Looks like the market maker's like, well, shit, maybe we are going to 430 by Friday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14405480","14407480"," We're going to worry about that now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14407480","14410480"," Okay, so what do we do here?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14410480","14413480"," What do you do here?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14413480","14417480"," You want to see this resistance turn into support, right?"

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14426480","14427480"," We talked about this, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14427480","14432480"," If you didn't take the trade down below, what are you then looking for?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14432480","14439480"," You're going to be looking for support and then a push higher into Thursday, Friday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14439480","14441480"," Now, trading 4.22.88."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14441480","14442480"," Tapping it again."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14442480","14444480"," Tap that S."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14444480","14446480"," Slap the S."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14447480","14448480"," What does that mean to you?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14448480","14449480"," We missed it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14449480","14450480"," You're going to say that, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14450480","14451480"," You're going to say, I missed it."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14456480","14457480"," Look at that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14457480","14458480"," Oh, stretch it out."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14458480","14465480"," What are we looking for for Friday, right?"

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14473480","14475480"," You already know you got a trend line up above, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14476480","14478480"," So, what are you waiting for?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14478480","14479480"," 4.23.54, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14479480","14482480"," We're going to go back to Book Map in case anybody's still holding on."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14482480","14484480"," But you can see it right here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14484480","14485480"," You can see that, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14485480","14487480"," 4.23.57."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14487480","14490480"," So, you want to see this get held here for us to go higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14490480","14493480"," The price tag that 430."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14493480","14496480"," 4.23.66, right?"

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14498480","14500480"," Moon shot."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14500480","14502480"," What's our next level above here?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14502480","14507480"," Resistance, right where we are right now, 4.23.93."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14527480","14528480"," See that, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14528480","14531480"," Nice little bull flag right here, blasted north."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14531480","14534480"," We need to get above this 4.24."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14534480","14537480"," You get above this 4.24, where are we going?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14537480","14539480"," What are we open to above here?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14539480","14541480"," You guys know we're open to above here."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14542480","14545480"," We're open to 4.30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14545480","14548480"," If you're scared, you buy call spreads, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14548480","14550480"," If you're scared, you buy call spreads."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14550480","14553480"," You want to deal with it, you buy call spreads."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14559480","14560480"," A little bit of reversal."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14560480","14565480"," Let's see if we can find and establish some kind of support down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14565480","14567480"," Let's see if we can buy another dip down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14567480","14571480"," Let's see if we can enter a second or third trade or a fourth trade or a fifth trade."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14571480","14573480"," Maybe we get down in here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14573480","14575480"," We do a little bit of this action, we take this thing north."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14575480","14577480"," Maybe we're not even granted that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14577480","14580480"," Maybe we just get stuck here and we just keep chasing it, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14580480","14581480"," We're not going to do that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14581480","14585480"," We're going to buy it again."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14585480","14587480"," And right here is where it's showing, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14587480","14588480"," These are where the bears are right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14588480","14590480"," They're telling you, fuck, no, we're not doing this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14590480","14591480"," Look at them."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14591480","14593480"," They just came in full force."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14593480","14595480"," The bears are like, oh, shit, man."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14595480","14596480"," I got shorts."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14596480","14597480"," I'm starting to lose money."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14597480","14600480"," And you're like, nah, we're going to break through this and we're going to take this north."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14600480","14603480"," Where are we going to take it to?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14603480","14604480"," 4.30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14604480","14605480"," 4.30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14605480","14610480"," 5 is on tap."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14610480","14612480"," So let's look at it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14612480","14614480"," Let's change our price target here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14615480","14617480"," Oh, yeah, there it is right there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14617480","14618480"," We didn't change it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14618480","14620480"," It's just right there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14620480","14621480"," There's that 4.30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14621480","14623480"," We haven't even looked at it all day long."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14623480","14626480"," Go back and find out who told you we couldn't go up to 4.30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14626480","14628480"," I want names."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14628480","14630480"," I want heads to roll."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14661480","14663480"," We got some crazies up here at 4.36."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14663480","14667480"," They might come swooping down and try to knock us in the face at 4.30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14667480","14670480"," We'll take note of that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14670480","14672480"," Tell me we ain't getting up here in one day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14672480","14675480"," Just slapped another of almost 50 points on the board."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14683480","14686480"," All the risk is on you."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14686480","14688480"," None of the risk is on a bull."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14730480","14735480"," The shit talking will be live on Twitter today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14735480","14737480"," So we had our first price target."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14737480","14739480"," Next price target is 4.20."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14739480","14740480"," What do we call it?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14740480","14741480"," 4.26."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14741480","14743480"," And then 4.30, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14743480","14745480"," Let's look again and see where next price target is."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14745480","14747480"," Trading level of level."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14747480","14749480"," Trading to level of level."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14749480","14752480"," We're open to different ideas."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14752480","14754480"," So right here, I want you to see this right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14754480","14756480"," 4.25, 74ish."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14756480","14758480"," 4.25, 54, 24, 80."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14758480","14760480"," They're trying to put a hold up right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14760480","14761480"," They're trying to turn it over right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14761480","14763480"," Bears trying to step in, roll it over."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14763480","14766480"," They're coming in a little bit, kind of hot."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14766480","14769480"," Expect some resistance here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14769480","14771480"," But what are you looking to towards next?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14771480","14774480"," 4.26, 83, and 4.30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14774480","14775480"," Bears are telling you no."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14775480","14776480"," Just be careful here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14776480","14778480"," We have a little bit of a roll over."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14778480","14781480"," And if it does roll over here, what are we looking for for support?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14781480","14784480"," We've got 4.22.51 to look at."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14784480","14787480"," So that's in line, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14787480","14788480"," Where's your stop set?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14788480","14792480"," Down below 4.20.65, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14792480","14794480"," So we'll start taking a look here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14794480","14795480"," We're going higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14795480","14796480"," I don't think we're done."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14796480","14798480"," So in my view, we're not going done."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14798480","14800480"," We're not done yet."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14800480","14803480"," We've already made enough money to at least take some risk down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14803480","14807480"," So right down here, we'll take some risk."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14807480","14809480"," We're going to look for this is powerful here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14809480","14810480"," Big powerful move."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14810480","14812480"," If we don't start trading down here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14812480","14820480"," That's a sign of power."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14820480","14821480"," Well, wait a minute."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14821480","14822480"," Wait a minute."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14822480","14823480"," They're getting pushed up higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14823480","14824480"," See what they're doing now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14824480","14827480"," 4.25.50."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14827480","14828480"," So 4.25.50."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14828480","14829480"," Look for a break."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14829480","14830480"," 4.25.50."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14830480","14834480"," Price target."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14834480","14836480"," See if they can smash it up there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14836480","14837480"," Watching calls coming to the market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14837480","14845480"," I was saying nothing in the economy right now suggests that it's close to or vulnerable to a recession."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14845480","14850480"," Saying we could see some slower economic activity as physical policy wins."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14850480","14854480"," $2.05 now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14854480","14856480"," They were down at 50 cents twice today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14856480","14858480"," 60 cents twice today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14858480","14860480"," It's a 400% print twice."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14868480","14875480"," 4.25.50 for a price target."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14875480","14880480"," See them right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14880480","14881480"," 4.25.40, I guess."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14881480","14882480"," We're getting close."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14882480","14884480"," Be careful up here as we break up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14884480","14885480"," Excuse me."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14885480","14886480"," Come on."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14886480","14887480"," Come on."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14887480","14888480"," Come around."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14888480","14890480"," How are you doing, princess?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14898480","14900480"," My youngest baby."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14900480","14902480"," And lastly, I have a little daughter."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14902480","14905480"," She's the most perfect little thing in the entire world."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14905480","14907480"," Light of my life."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14907480","14909480"," She's one of the interns, too."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14909480","14913480"," She's the one I give your tips to, by the way."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14916480","14918480"," Young lady."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14918480","14921480"," 4.25.50."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14921480","14923480"," 4.25.50."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14924480","14927480"," 4.25.50."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14927480","14931480"," Look at that power move, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14931480","14933480"," Talk to you about bull flags."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14933480","14938480"," And when you don't stay in the bull flag, that's a sign of a power move, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14938480","14942480"," If you don't end up consolidating down here, what does that mean, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14942480","14947480"," If you don't come down here to find support, it means that you've got to be able to get"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14947480","14948480"," up consolidating down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14948480","14950480"," What does that mean, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14950480","14954480"," If you don't come down here to find support, it means that you've got strong support here,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14954480","14955480"," right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14955480","14958480"," You're going to be looking for a price target above, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14958480","14959480"," 4.25.50."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14959480","14966480"," If there's a break above here, right, you're going to see a blast off the 4.30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14966480","14967480"," See that, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14967480","14969480"," We did this earlier today, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14969480","14970480"," Now, 4.24."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14970480","14971480"," 4.24."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14971480","14972480"," 56."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14972480","14975480"," Yeah, baby."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14975480","14992480"," Please like, subscribe these videos, tune in every single day."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","14998480","15001480"," of that kind of nonsense, stop doing it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15001480","15002480"," Come find us."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15002480","15003480"," Come trade with us."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15003480","15007800"," Better than any class you can buy, better than any newsletter you can buy that is not"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15007800","15012080"," relevant to the price action on the market every day, better than any video that you"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15012080","15024480"," can watch the night before, so you know what's happening every single day as it happens."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15024480","15026480"," See them up here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15026480","15027480"," 4.25."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15027480","15031480"," Here, you're going to be careful of this, 4.24.60, but the real sellers are above up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15031480","15036480"," And actually, again, push higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15036480","15037480"," Cranking up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15037480","15038480"," Look at this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15038480","15039480"," This is insane."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15039480","15040480"," To 4.27."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15040480","15048480"," I don't know if we'll get there today, but we'll try."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15048480","15051480"," We will try."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15051480","15054480"," Down below here, 4.22.31."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15054480","15057480"," Area of support, keep this in your mind here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15057480","15059480"," Take a look down below here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15059480","15061480"," Intraday support down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15061480","15066480"," It's certainly possible that we'll need to move policy to restrictive levels."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15066480","15069480"," It's a little bearish."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15069480","15071480"," It's a little bear."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15071480","15074480"," If they need to move above the neutral, they won't hesitate."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15074480","15078480"," But we don't know if we'll get to that point today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15078480","15081480"," Decision is in front of us."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15081480","15086480"," Let's go back in, right down in here, 4.22.26."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15086480","15099480"," See if I can grab a dip down here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15099480","15108480"," Keep my eyes right in here, right down here, 4.22.23, somewhere in there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15138480","15146480"," This is the trade I'm trading right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15146480","15152480"," If this moved down this pound, see if we can move this thing higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15152480","15159480"," If it rolls it off, if it gets something like this, I'll take that trade and add to the trade into the close for Friday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15169480","15176480"," We're looking for a blast above and through this 4.25.50."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15176480","15179480"," It's going to be a big move in the market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15179480","15183480"," If we break through here, it's going to get crazy."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15183480","15207480"," If we don't break through here, if we get some resistance here, if we break through here, it's going to be on."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15207480","15213480"," If we reverse here at 4.25, that could get kind of wild."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15213480","15220480"," Be careful here, take some off the table, add some if you're out, and we should blast higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15220480","15225480"," I'm long here, so if you want to know I'm long here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15225480","15231480"," But if we break above this 4.25.50, 4.25.60, sky is the limit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15231480","15235480"," With that being said, we could roll over here into the bell. It's already 3 o'clock."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15235480","15237480"," We've only got one hour left."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15237480","15241480"," You might want to take some off the table up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15241480","15242480"," Go on here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15253480","15255480"," We're going to talk about this right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15255480","15258480"," We're going to be aware of this as we go in here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15258480","15266480"," So you see this resistance here, right? If we break above it, we're going to probably break above it, bounce around, and start heading towards 4.30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15266480","15271480"," With that said, where we are right now, you should be full ported in right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15271480","15274480"," There could be a roll over here as my point."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15274480","15276480"," Finding some resistance here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15276480","15280480"," 4.25.50 is the target."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15281480","15282480"," Go on here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15289480","15290480"," Right about there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15290480","15293480"," That's the target right here, okay?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15293480","15295480"," If we can get that last little push."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15295480","15299480"," Now, if it's rejected and we roll over, what they're going to do is this."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15299480","15303480"," They'll end up rolling it down into the bell, and you buy that piece right there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15303480","15307480"," You see this greater move here?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15308480","15312480"," You just keep that in your eyes over here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15312480","15319480"," And sometimes on a larger move, you might get something like this, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15319480","15323480"," Come down, come down, and then we go up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15323480","15325480"," So look for another entry down below here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15325480","15329480"," If this is an A, this is a B down here, end of the bell."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15329480","15330480"," I don't think we get down here today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15330480","15331480"," I think we go up higher."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15331480","15336480"," I'm in the case of they're going to put the 4.30 in the board today and wrap it up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15336480","15340480"," Trade it sideways into the weekend."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15340480","15345480"," But with that being said, take some money off the table."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15345480","15347480"," We know that 4.25.50 is right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15347480","15349480"," Take some money off."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15349480","15350480"," Maybe it bounces back down."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15350480","15352480"," We head up towards 4.30 to the bell."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15352480","15357480"," We're now trading 4.24.65."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15357480","15361480"," We want to see a break above here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15362480","15363480"," You can see it right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15363480","15365480"," We're testing those upper limits right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15365480","15367480"," 4.25, 4.25, 50."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15367480","15369480"," I don't care about this 4.27 as much."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15369480","15371480"," If you break this right here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15371480","15373480"," Next stop, 4.30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15373480","15375480"," Absolutely."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15375480","15379480"," This is going to send bears, or not bears, but shorts railing back in the market."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15379480","15382480"," It opens the door right away to 4.30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15382480","15384480"," You'll start to see hedging for 4.30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15384480","15386480"," What happens here, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15387480","15391480"," You start to get dealers that have to hedge the move into 4.30."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15391480","15393480"," They're going to help you along the way here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15393480","15395480"," We just tagged 4.24.90."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15395480","15397480"," We talked about this earlier today, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15397480","15399480"," If we don't consolidate down here, there's a sign of a power move."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15399480","15400480"," They're making it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15400480","15402480"," Take some money off."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15402480","15404480"," Take some money off the table, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15404480","15405480"," Start doing it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15405480","15406480"," Just put some money in the bank."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15406480","15408480"," Take your wife and your boyfriend out."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15408480","15409480"," Take your them out."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15409480","15412480"," Take whatever your wife, your husband, your husband, your wife, your husband."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15412480","15413480"," You're at a harem or something."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15413480","15414480"," You've got like six wives."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15414480","15416480"," You've got like 10 husbands, and you're making all the money."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15416480","15420480"," If your husband's at home right now doing dishes, call him at home and tell him to make dinner"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","15420480","15423480"," as well, because you're the one making the money."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16378560","16386240"," another dip buy, but it ain't coming down. Price target above 428.32. Next stop after that 430."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16386240","16392160"," This is an area of contention. If you are along this market, time does not matter. If we trade"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16392160","16397360"," up to 430 today, you are going to expect a rejection here, okay? Definitely expect a rejection"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16397360","16402400"," at 430 today. This is a natural place for how far we've come, but honestly, expect a rejection"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16402400","16406960"," and maybe another dip buy even end of day or in tomorrow. I'm not going to expect to trade higher"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16406960","16414160"," than 430 today at least. It's fairly close here to where we want to be on today. It's a nice push"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16414160","16422000"," up higher. So I'm going to give a price target today of 430. We're at 426.64. But you're going"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16422960","16429120"," to expect some resistance. We know that we're talking about 427 above here. We're already at 426.64."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16429920","16436560"," So just be aware of this. Take profit. If you were buying down below, take profit."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16438160","16443440"," If you're looking for a place to buy, we know the stock market doesn't go straight up."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16445200","16451200"," So we're going to look for some profit taking here and maybe another trip up into Friday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16452880","16457360"," It's a beautiful day, by the way. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful day."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16460400","16464240"," Just consider this, okay? If you're long and you're like, not cap, I'm holding it no matter what."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16464800","16469840"," That's fine. Take some off the table. If we trade down, we'll add a little bit to your trade."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16471360","16478000"," But this shouldn't end into Friday. You really need some really fucking bad news for this to end."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16482000","16490080"," If you're a bear out there, I still love you too. I get bearish in here. So if you bear,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16490800","16494160"," don't worry about it. If you're a bear, what are you looking for? Your next place to short."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16494720","16502000"," Where's the probable place? 430. What's the other fear in here, right? That we trade down and"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16502000","16507280"," up. We smash 430 for maybe two or three more days. Wednesday, we're just smashing 430."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16507280","16510800"," Maybe you wait until Friday to grab some 430s for Monday. But for right now,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16512240","16516560"," bulls haven't had too many good days. Give a bull a day to have some money."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16523760","16527040"," So it's more than likely going up. That's my point. It's more than likely going up here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16529280","16533840"," Go out there and call those fake bulls out there so it wasn't going to 430."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16534640","16544720"," Call them out. Call them out, baby. Look at that move. Look at that move for today."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16546400","16552000"," Boom. We bought this down here. Remember, when we bought this down here, look at where it's at"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16552000","16561120"," right now. 415 to 427. 426.90. Pin striking right now. Let's take a look and see where the bears are."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16561680","16566960"," Where sellers are. I don't see them. Look at them. They're up here. Look at this right here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16568000","16582000"," We now got 427 as a price target. And now we're looking at 429. And there's 430 above."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16582800","16591760"," So let's bring this a little bit closer here."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16595520","16604160"," So we're striking now 427. Then we have 429, right? So we called 427. Can't even keep up with the"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16604160","16610320"," marks at this point. So there's 427, right? We said we're going to tag 427. And now we've got a price"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16610320","16619760"," target above of 429, right? So you got 427, 429, and then 430 right here should be the buffer."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16623920","16630480"," Okay, so if we come up here to 430, right? Natural progression is to 430."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16631760","16639280"," The next stop above that is 436. When does this happen? Does this happen today? I don't think so."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16640160","16645200"," Maybe he could. That's like that 450. We can get there. It's just not it's not probable. The"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16645200","16651440"," chances get lesser and lesser as we get closer to 430, believe it or not. Now, does that mean we"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16651440","16657920"," can't tag 430 once again tomorrow or Friday? Absolutely. That also means that the gamma has"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16657920","16665600"," changed in the market. So do we start looking towards 440 as being a top or something to attempt"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16665600","16673760"," to get to over time? It depends. If we get above 430 here, 440 becomes the most natural place to go."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16673760","16680560"," If you're a bear or a bull, though, I want to be key in here, okay? The trade is to the price."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16680560","16684640"," If we get up to this 430 mark, we called it this morning. We said 430 is top right between now and"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16684640","16690960"," Friday, right? Take your money and run and reassess. Take your money and run and reassess."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16691760","16695200"," Remember back here, I want to show you guys something, okay? Even though we're up here,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16695200","16700400"," I want to show you guys something. We'll wait a minute. I want to just get you to snap out of"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16700400","16705360"," it, okay? Remember this right here? Remember this power move we had? Remember this power move?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16706080","16710560"," Remember I said we have to find acceptance to take this higher. If we don't, it's going to get ugly,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16712400","16718720"," right? There it is again. There's 436, right? See the 436 we're talking about? If we start"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16718720","16724400"," trading this up to 436 up here, we've had this happen before, right? You tag it up here and then"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16724400","16733200"," it rolls, right? So just be careful of that larger macro picture, okay? Keep your eyes on that."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16734080","16738720"," Okay, we could trade sideways. We could trade down and come up, right? We could give all this back"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16738720","16743360"," and then come back up here for Friday. So just be aware of this as we move forward. Take the money"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16743360","16753360"," of the table, look for repositioning around 430. Look at that monster move right there."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16754320","16761280"," Look at that bad boy right there. Leave that one right there. 427-41 trading right now."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16761280","16765680"," Next stop, 429. After 429, we're going to tag 430."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16767760","16777520"," 427-49. 427-54. 427-58. Look at that monster moves. Giant monster moves."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16784000","16805280"," 4.30 C is now $2.94. $2.98. $3. That's a 600% trade right there. 600%. Matter of fact,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16805280","16811840"," with earlier, if you'd done it twice, it was like a 200 or 400. Now for the second pull down below,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16811840","16817120"," 600% right now where we are on this live stream. Now $3.99."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16817120","16821040"," Really mark it on close to the buy side. Small, 200 million to the buy side of stocks."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16821680","16828880"," Make fresh new highs today. 49.90 in the SBK market. We're both 34,000 again in the Dow,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16828880","16834800"," which is up almost 900 points. Straight the fuck up right now. 420-803."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16842560","16849120"," We were told this morning that the put fuel would run out at 420."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16850320","16853760"," That didn't happen, did it? That didn't happen, did it?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16855760","16860960"," Trading up now to 430. If we hit this 430 today, I'm going to give you a price target of"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16860960","16867120"," who I'm going to probably come back down to 420 and test it and a price target of 436 by Friday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16867920","16875040"," 436 price target. We'll trade it as it comes along here. Now we're at 420.804."

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16915680","16922000"," See if the bulls can hang on to it and the bell is huge melt up now. We're looking for 429 and 430."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16922000","16926080"," We're going to look back on book map and watch the stretch up here"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16926080","16929360"," into this area above. We've got 429."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","16937280","16945280"," Just grinding and pushing right now. Drying and pushing right now. 428-35. You can see above"

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","17671840","17678960"," Right around 430. Right in the money. Small, wide, small spread. I would go like 430 to 434,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","17678960","17688240"," maybe for 428 to 434. Put spread data from May 20th. If you're a bull, you should take that trade"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","17688240","17695600"," and take this long to 440. If we get above 430 here. These are all important things you need to know"

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","17712000","17716800"," this market and print both sides. Anyone that tells you that is wrong, you just leave them,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","17716800","17721680"," you don't sell them. If we trade up to 440, you have a put spread of 430. And you're like,"

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","17771840","17776960"," for when we start to make this move higher, right? And if you come to me and like, oh,"

"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18305200","18309120"," You're looking for taking the money and run. You're going to come back into tomorrow, right?"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18309120","18313680"," And the bears are going to want to see a retest of 4.14. So you're going to wait for tomorrow"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18313680","18317840"," 10 to the trade next down. You're going to wait for a sell down into the overnight,"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18318560","18323200"," right? And a retest of this low at 4.14.13. You may not get there. You probably get to 4.15."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18323600","18328880"," Or 4.20. Even off this 4.30. So take your money and run. We talked about this earlier."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18328880","18332800"," If you wanted to buy some shit tickets after the bell, you can. But I don't recommend it."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18332800","18337760"," I think that we come back down. We could limit up. It's possible. But I don't think so. I think"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18337760","18343120"," that the fuel is gone for the moment. I think we still trade up into the weekend."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18343120","18346640"," But I think you take your money and run up here. I think that you wait for another buy in on"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18346640","18351680"," Thursday. We can get a little bit of a big off of those some premium off those calls"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18351680","18359840"," heading into Friday. And then you look for another buy on 4.30 on Thursday. 4.40 for Friday."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18359840","18364000"," Expire. Excuse me. I'm extumbling over all these fours and apps and all that kind of stuff."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18364640","18370640"," Well, we could gap up. It's possible. Sometimes we'll gap up and over as a possibility. What"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18370640","18374480"," will happen is the futures put in futures. You'll have a globe x traders. If you can't do it in"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18374480","18380400"," cash, we'll do it in futures. Then we'll just bump it over. Can't get done in cash market. They'll"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18380480","18385680"," bump it over. And the reason they bump it over. Is because they want to look up to 4.40."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18385680","18389760"," And if cash market can't do that, we'll start heading down. So there's that possibility."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18389760","18393200"," Even if we don't have a venue fuel. We're up here looking around."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18394160","18397760"," Globex to give us a chance. There's a chance. A chance. Small chance."
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18399120","18404400"," But the risk versus reward. Not good enough for me. I'm going to be looking for another dip"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18404400","18412240"," by tomorrow off the bell on Thursday to go higher. If if we open higher tomorrow at let's say we"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18412240","18418080"," open tomorrow at 4.32 or 4.33 or something like that. The market's going to be looking for direction"
"_5SdcLHTzXQ","18418080","18423120"," off that bell. So I would recommend that you take profit. If we gap it up overnight,"
