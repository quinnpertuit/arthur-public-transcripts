"290","9690"," Being short in the decade ahead, all right, let's see, we're just going to open right on the"
"9690","10590"," opening screen here."
"38920","43940"," Good morning, everybody."
"43940","46240"," Good morning, blind out, blind nest out. "
"46460","53100"," Good morning, RS, good morning, Jake, you, Paul, John, Joshua, endless, Joe, Jafar, Yoruba, A.K.,"
"53100","54780"," Brian Martin, Chris S."
"55300","56560"," Dylan, Jacob, good morning."
"57120","57640"," How's everybody doing?"
"59660","60940"," Sorry, I'm a little late this morning."
"61920","63860"," I've got a breakfast with my babies. "
"66140","70120"," It's been a busy weekend, plus we had the superb owl this weekend."
"72360","75080"," Vodka, Johnny Five, Desperado, Chansu, Joe."
"75900","77620"," Happy Valentine's Day to you and your family, Joe. "
"79420","80180"," Eric, good morning."
"80940","82320"," Vegas, good morning, fell, Jen."
"82900","83500"," We've got a lot to get to. "
"83600","86220"," We've only got 13 minutes until the bell starts, just as it heads up."
"86720","91920"," You guys can see up here already that there's a short on the mark or there's a pin on the"
"91920","96540"," marker right now heading into the open bell, trying to keep it down into the opening bell."
"96540","101040"," More than likely, it's dealers trying to pin to weaken. "
"102960","108680"," I get more in Gerald, Brad, John, Ben, Paul, Mohan, good to see you, Joe, good to see you,"
"108900","109780"," Desperado, good to see you."
"110380","111680"," Yeah, it was a wild night, right?"
"113000","114400"," It was definitely a wild night."
"115460","121220"," It's funny because we have all this horrible news and it was intentionally pinned all weekend long. "
"121740","124920"," It's kind of disgusting when you see stuff like this in the market."
"124920","128479"," It shows how manipulated our market really is."
"130640","132400"," It's kind of gross when you see this stuff. "
"132840","135960"," And then, of course, I saw a tweet this weekend saying that when we smart people are making money"
"135960","138920"," in the market and it's not smart meat people."
"139060","140560"," It's powerful people making money in the market."
"140720","141300"," That's all it is. "
"142860","145080"," So I'm a little pissed off at that too as well."
"146000","147100"," Good morning, T-Chrone."
"147980","148580"," How'd it hurt?"
"148760","148980"," Good morning. "
"149620","152300"," That puts the little people at a disadvantage across the board."
"153060","156980"," You know, it's not just minutes or hours."
"157360","158800"," It's a whole plan, right?"
"159040","161920"," This whole entire market becomes manipulated and you have to figure it out. "
"162320","163340"," Figure it out on your own."
"163360","165240"," You can't trust anything that's out there."
"166920","170080"," Now, we've got a bunch of stuff to go through real quick here. "
"170240","177540"," I'm going to put some charts up for you on Twitter to show you levels for today."
"178020","181060"," But I'm going to get through a few things we have going on here."
"184730","189010"," I'm going to tell you to expect our put selling at the bell today. "
"189750","197030"," Now, we did break down to 435.20. And we didn't quite break."
"197690","198970"," I don't know if we did in the over."
"199090","207910"," I haven't checked the futures to see if we broke below 435.00. If we did break below 430, it"
"207910","211490"," does set us up for a move lower to 420. "
"212470","216610"," And then outside and look at, to be honest with you, I've been busy all weekend long."
"216910","220110"," But if we, if I'll take a look at it here just in just a moment."
"220550","226350"," If we did break below that, you are going to be looking for 4,200, right?"
"226530","227110"," Test 4,200. "
"227710","230730"," And then another issue that we have with this, I'm going to take a look right now and see if"
"230730","230970"," we did."
"231810","236970"," Another issue that we have with this is the gig is kind of up now."
"237830","242770"," If you guys recall, when we touched back to 420 back in January. "
"244490","247590"," I kept buying puts, put edges all the way up, right?"
"247850","255089"," And I had some, some real low ones print and then I had some for 44, 42s that wound up"
"255089","255950"," printing on Friday."
"256790","258269"," I didn't reload up on puts."
"258510","260910"," I took the long on Friday. "
"261170","261870"," I should have taken."
"262370","263490"," I don't know what I should have taken."
"263490","265470"," I know what I mean. "
"265550","267410"," I probably should have stayed flat into today."
"267430","268970"," I'm going to add to that position today as well."
"269070","269810"," I think we're going up. "
"270630","273650"," But I want you guys out there to all understand, okay?"
"273870","278910"," That every time we hear this story, this bull story, I keep asking you guys a bunch of questions."
"279050","279730"," They're simple ones."
"280210","282290"," Like, what do bulls have to look forward to?"
"282870","284210"," Give me something, right?"
"284390","287390"," That bulls have to look forward to and they really don't have anything to look forward to. "
"288530","291470"," And there's panic, of course, from bears that are short this market."
"291470","292570"," I want to be short this market."
"292570","296550"," I'm going to put another post on Twitter about the way the market's been trading. "
"297370","302290"," That doesn't mean we don't break out of this pattern that we're in right now, either."
"302730","305490"," But it does mean, you know, I'm asked, like, are you still bearish?"
"305530","307310"," How can you be bearish and we're trading up, right?"
"307770","310030"," I've been asked that ad nauseam."
"310050","316150"," I'm not quite impressed saying that President Putin is deciding on whether to make their response"
"316150","317170"," to the U.S. public. "
"318250","320230"," Yeah, so I've been asked that ad nauseam, right?"
"320230","323210"," How can you be bearish in the market?"
"323390","324310"," You have bullish same time."
"324490","325950"," I've been asked ad nauseam."
"325970","328430"," What do you mean we're neutral here and not bullish?"
"328830","331050"," And that played itself out on Thursday and Friday. "
"331430","337450"," The draft of the response to security issues prepared."
"339950","341970"," So none of that has gone away."
"342190","346630"," And just as an overall macro view of the market, I have to warn all of you that we will"
"346630","347390"," trade up of course. "
"347650","349370"," We're going to make money on both sides of this trade."
"349370","353970"," But I do want you to realize out there that you should be able to have both a bearish and"
"353970","354250"," a bullish."
"354690","355450"," I'll look at the market. "
"355850","357530"," There is one key problem though."
"358110","363930"," And that is at some point that at some point you can't trick bulls anymore."
"365430","371530"," And this was the move to tell bulls, you know, the gig is up. "
"371730","372890"," Basically the gig is up."
"372970","374290"," You can't just be bullish."
"374570","376690"," You can't just say we're going into all-time highs. "
"376690","380110"," If you are going to say that, then there's a major issue, right?"
"380310","385190"," You've got a functional issue with how you're investing in trading this market."
"385530","388170"," No matter where we trade to today, it doesn't matter where we trade to next month."
"389010","394470"," But this past week, especially Thursday and Friday, basically proves the theory that I've had right"
"394470","395890"," at this entire time. "
"397390","399050"," And we rolled over, right?"
"399230","401770"," We didn't break out of that major resistance channel."
"402710","405890"," At best, we were neutral heading over that resistance channel."
"406670","409290"," We wound up rolling over at that time period. "
"410850","412290"," So I just want to be aware of that."
"412350","417930"," I want you to be aware too that this move down Thursday and Friday has shaken the bulls, the last"
"417930","419050"," bulls to their core."
"420250","423370"," I saw them come out this weekend with YouTube videos all over YouTube. "
"423870","425410"," I saw the posts all weekend long."
"427630","428810"," There's panic out there."
"428890","430270"," There's panic hidden behind the scenes. "
"430270","434150"," I promise you that there is panic behind the scenes with bulls."
"434330","435570"," That doesn't mean we can't drive it up."
"435610","437350"," We're not going to go to all-time highs either. "
"437430","443710"," It just means that unlike before, there was this whole thing about hammering out a bottom that this"
"443710","448390"," is the only downtime we're going to have back in January and it's blue skies above."
"448950","449930"," And it just isn't."
"450210","452710"," And this move down Thursday and Friday proves that point. "
"454010","457810"," So we are right now still in negative gamma territory."
"457810","461250"," We are still below a volatility trigger."
"462350","464930"," We should expect to move up higher today off the bell. "
"465350","469850"," There should be some kind of a, kind of a, you can call it a dead cat bounce, whatever you"
"469850","470390"," want to call it."
"470790","473430"," But a 2% move really isn't a dead cat bounce."
"473850","474970"," It hasn't really moved 2% either. "
"475410","479270"," One of these things are absolutes, but I would expect us to move up today off the bell."
"479870","484510"," Even if we trade red bar off the bell or fake out and then we trade higher, you should expect"
"484510","487390"," us that we move up higher this morning."
"488550","491650"," I'm going to go over what spot gamma spec and put out a couple things. "
"491950","494850"," I'm going to post both of them on to the Twitter handle at some point."
"495150","498990"," I'm going to give you the AM report, but there are some functional defects within our market"
"498990","500750"," defects within our market."
"501090","507230"," So futures broke lower overnight and are currently trading at 43.75. The models we'll see continued"
"507230","513870"," volatility with a spot game implied move of 1.5%. One standard deviation we're open to close. "
"514150","521929"," The VIX currently at 30 implies a one day S&P move of 1.89%. Resistance lies at, write these"
"521929","524070"," down, okay, get yourself a piece of paper and pen out there."
"524650","530950"," Resistance lies at 4397.4410 and then 4500."
"531990","533710"," So that's those are your resistance numbers, right?"
"535850","537750"," 4397.4410 and 4500. "
"538630","539810"," That's your resistance levels."
"540970","546750"," And then on your support levels this morning, you've got 4344 and 4300."
"547730","552190"," I'll list those to you once more to give you guys just a moment here. "
"553170","556070"," So you've got support levels at again."
"557190","557890"," It's funny."
"558170","561610"," You know, if you guys remember that chart that I posted, I'm looking at it right now. "
"561670","562610"," I haven't even touched it."
"562610","570270"," But if you guys look at that chart that I posted on the Captain's Twitter handle, I showed that red"
"570270","578370"," line below that said, if we break this number down here, we will test 4200 and likely lower to 4 "
"578370","580030",",000 to 3,900."
"580330","583030"," And we literally struck it to the pen, right?"
"583470","584930"," We struck it to the pen on Friday. "
"585450","589850"," I wanted to take a look at that number and the importance of that number and how it relates to"
"589850","592050"," how we trade moving ahead."
"592050","597470"," So those same numbers are 4397, right?"
"597590","601010"," Just remember that number 4397 is your first support."
"602070","606230"," And then your next, excuse me, that's your first resistance 4397. "
"607510","609750"," And we're trading at that currently right now."
"610370","613710"," Your next resistance level is going to be 4410."
"614870","617630"," And then your next resistance is 4500. "
"617630","621430"," And inflation is now high and hopes that goods prices will settle."
"622150","625010"," So basically, 4500 is inside of that wedge, right?"
"625730","627510"," You guys can understand that."
"627870","633070"," That wedge is where resistance is this morning. "
"633390","636270"," So if we break out of that rope wedge, right, you know, we're going to go flying."
"636830","638790"," You know that any of the shorts are going to get squeezed."
"639530","642070"," We could get that melt up to that area today. "
"642830","646650"," And that really is what you're looking for is 4500 today, if you're a bull."
"647890","654210"," Now, if we break below that 40, if you break below that 4350, we are going to see lower prices."
"655430","657130"," Be conscious of that today as well. "
"657470","659850"," Matter of fact, you can just look at what I posted last Friday."
"660050","661150"," And it's all the same kind of stuff."
"661670","665750"," So 4500 is a big number for you to realize for today, right?"
"665950","667330"," Big number for the bulls, 4500. "
"667870","670410"," And then the other one is 4410."
"672270","676010"," We need to think about wages and inflation at a different horizon."
"677670","679430"," And we're right on that right now, right?"
"679610","682190"," So 4397, 4410. "
"682650","684490"," So the price started today off the bell."
"684870","687810"," Expect to move to 4500 unless we get rejected right off the bell."
"688510","690010"," Expect some short covering. "
"690290","692770"," Also expect put selling off the bell."
"692830","695950"," You should see some large put flow on flow."
"704850","709430"," So through an options lens, this is a marketing control of puts and elevated implied volatility. "
"710050","714450"," The existing put positions are large, as shown below, the surging implied volatility levels."
"715090","717290"," VIX is greater than 30, suggests puts are expensive."
"718170","719110"," So I went a key into this. "
"719290","720210"," Okay, puts are expensive."
"721230","725930"," We'd need new and or rolling of positions to significantly change the game."
"726650","729790"," And push that lower bound that lower bound down. "
"730110","732450"," Basically, if we don't have any bad news today, right?"
"733270","735010"," Unless we and we talk about this, right?"
"735390","737230"," Put hedges and then puts are different."
"737890","739350"," We have puts that are out there."
"739410","740310"," We have put hedges. "
"740310","742670"," We've got put buyers on Friday into the bell."
"743010","746850"," And if we don't have any negative news today, they're not going to print them."
"747010","748930"," That's the basic line, right?"
"748930","756530"," If new buyers of puts don't step into the market to print the old put holders, longs, right?"
"756750","759970"," Longs in this market that there's no way the dealers are going to want to print those. "
"760190","762350"," And that's the key heading into the Friday close."
"762790","766250"," And now this morning Monday, they're going to take all your money and they're going to run."
"766490","767730"," Nobody bought calls on Friday. "
"768290","770390"," Everybody about puts into the bell on Friday."
"771030","772230"," And they don't want to print those."
"772710","774270"," So the bears are going to have to double down. "
"774410","778910"," If you're down like 10 grand, right?"
"778910","781950"," Drop another 10 grand on puts right now at the opening bell today."
"782470","785890"," Otherwise, this market is going to trade up today, at least."
"786370","787910"," And then we're going to get into it some point. "
"787990","788850"," I think I'm going to turn off."
"789270","792010"," I have an appointment today for my high glasses."
"792650","795470"," I got a new pair and I've been waiting to pick them up. "
"796130","802030"," But I do at some point, I think I'm going to turn off the book map and just go about"
"802030","803450"," some other stuff with you."
"803990","810470"," If the market slows down at all, if this doesn't rip to 450 today, if we kind of trade sideways"
"810470","816790"," or anything crazy like that, if we start straightening off at the bell this morning, I won't do it."
"816790","820670"," But if we have some time, I think I'm going to turn off book map and try to get you"
"820670","821910"," guys at least a daily briefing. "
"822270","824130"," And trading on the NYSC has commenced."
"826530","828330"," So we'll see what the plan is right now."
"828610","829470"," It is 930. "
"829810","831510"," It is opening bell time."
"831510","836370"," And I'm going to keep talking to you guys as this bell opens, okay?"
"836970","842630"," So however, at Carnard IV levels, incrementally large moves are required for puts to pay off."
"843210","847150"," This may deter put buyers and may incentivize put sellers to step up. "
"847690","852110"," Long puts closed could lead to some positive delta hedging, right?"
"852690","853930"," That is basically panic."
"854650","856670"," That basically means I bought puts on Friday at the bell."
"856670","860010"," I'm anticipating horrible news heading into Monday. "
"860010","862830"," And if it doesn't come, I have to close those puts."
"863490","866750"," We note that this high IV is linked with large IV swings."
"867650","871990"," Vol of all, which in turn can lead to rapid amplified hedge adjustments. "
"872890","874390"," Okay, you guys are copying all that, right?"
"877670","879310"," In other words, we do not need to change."
"879390","885490"," We do not need to change in put positions, but just the pricing of put positions to initiate large"
"885490","886370"," hedging flows."
"886910","889790"," Basically meaning everybody's heads to the tits. "
"890450","895390"," They want those puts to become cheap again so that people can rebuy them again."
"895970","897610"," And right now, they're just too expensive."
"898350","900650"," If IV declines, the market does start to rally. "
"901190","905630"," We see little resistance above the 4, 4, 1, 0 mark."
"905890","907490"," That's a key sentence there."
"908350","913490"," Okay, so if we are able to break above 4, 4, 1, 0 off this open, right?"
"914070","916870"," There's little resistance above 4, 4, 1, 0."
"917090","923530"," So suggesting a break above that line could spark a violent move higher into the 4,500 area. "
"924090","925850"," Because that is key this morning, okay?"
"926250","929290"," If we're able to break above and we're at 4, 4, 72, right?"
"929470","937850"," Or 40.72. If you can see a break above 4, 4, 1, 0 this morning, you are going to"
"937850","939550"," see a move to 4,500."
"940650","942430"," Okay, so let's be conscious of that."
"942430","946890"," We are already testing the upper bounds of resistance here. "
"947230","949150"," So we'll see if shorts can step in."
"949730","955030"," And if they can't, if new put buyers don't step in, if there's no new news that we have negative"
"955030","955450"," news."

"2595670","2599870"," Now, someone posted or commented in that. "
"2600110","2602590"," I just retweeted it on at Captain's Alpha."
"2603430","2611150"," So if you look at that infographic, someone commented in there who exactly was saying that or"
"2611150","2612730"," something about it trading exactly."
"2613150","2615130"," It doesn't trade exactly. "
"2616190","2623710"," I relate this infographic often to Elliot wave traders."
"2624310","2630170"," If you look at it closely, it doesn't trade exactly to how the market moves."
"2630930","2636690"," So you really can't use this infographic and say, oh, well, we're going down right where we are"
"2636690","2637470"," right now. "
"2638190","2638950"," You can't."
"2639310","2643950"," This market could come up another 100, 200, 300 points and still stay within this graphic."
"2645050","2646430"," So I don't want to comment. "
"2646730","2649330"," It wasn't the place on Twitter to comment on that."
"2649330","2655730"," Not to use this graphic as this is guaranteed where we're heading or that you should trade the"
"2655730","2656590"," market to this."
"2656850","2661150"," There is one other concern for me personally in this graphic. "
"2661750","2667130"," And that was where it shows the growth correction farther down the line."
"2667750","2671870"," We've had a large growth stock correction."
"2674710","2679090"," We've had a large growth stock correction that's taken place for the past year. "
"2680070","2686510"," So my concern is that you'll see this larger correction down the road."
"2687250","2688990"," But some growth stocks might not."
"2689090","2694230"," There's no doubt some OPEC members are having challenges meeting their targets. "
"2697130","2702310"," There is some thought or I have some thought that you might see this correction still."
"2707570","2710590"," You might see this growth correction further down the road."
"2711150","2715270"," But I don't know that every growth company would participate in that correction. "
"2715710","2721170"," You might see companies more like Apple participating in this correction part of the market later"
"2721170","2722030"," on in March."
"2722030","2727250"," But you might not see let's say let's say like an SQ participate fully in it."
"2727750","2734010"," Like you might see an SQ go down, but not quite like, hey, we're going to lose 90% or"
"2734010","2736510"," 50% of our position or anything like that. "
"2737350","2742650"," So be be tactful in looking for that growth correction in March."
"2744350","2745910"," I missed that one part there."
"2755780","2757380"," Let me see this. "
"2763120","2768180"," OPEC is saying the three means an issue of master under investment in oil sector in addition to"
"2768180","2770060"," geopolitics driving the market at the moment."
"2770660","2773760"," There's no doubt that some members are having challenges meeting targets."

"4552810","4553630"," Is that all you've been?"
"4553690","4554230"," It's just short?"
"4559020","4562400"," Okay, so I'm back to looking at what you guys are saying."
"4569510","4571190"," Yeah, we're just checking him out, seeing who he is. "
"4576520","4580290"," Yeah, I'm not going to be hard on him."
"4580330","4581050"," I'm going to be nice to him."
"4586780","4589900"," Alright, so we've got so far. "
"4590240","4591240"," Let's go through real quick."
"4591680","4593820"," We have the silver puts that came in."
"4594420","4596940"," We've got, let's scroll back through. "

"4599480","4603460"," We've got Twitter calls."
"4605120","4609840"," March 18th, 40C for $110,000. "
"4610660","4611200"," It's weird."
"4611300","4616900"," I saw some SC puts earlier, some large SC puts, but now seeing large SC calls."
"4617200","4618760"," March 18th, 135C. "

"4704100","4711400"," Spy calls again February 18th, 441C for $292,000."
"4719600","4721540"," Yeah, so let me see."
"4721760","4723140"," This is Spy, I think, right here. "
"4723780","4725260"," Yeah, we're just waiting for it to trade higher."
"4725580","4727260"," Or in my view, we're waiting for it to trade higher."
"4728940","4732720"," Silver, April 1st, 20.5 P, $41,000. "
"4733400","4735720"," So massive puts coming in on silver currently."
"4736100","4740360"," We'll take a look at silver next and see if we can take a bird's eye view on it."
"4743000","4744920"," Silver puts coming in by the truckload. "
"4744920","4754170"," So silver's got nine orders, half million dollars."
"4760270","4765970"," I'll focus around the 1st of April and the 14th of April."
"4767530","4772450"," April 4st and April 14th for $20.5 P."
"4775540","4778560"," We'll see if we can take a look at silver and see what's up. "
"4784100","4786560"," More buyers than sellers on silver currently."
"4786980","4788220"," Silver doesn't typically show."
"4788220","4797740"," Yeah, see, let's look at the loads of buyers on silver right now. "
"4802010","4804850"," Here are indicators negative, more buyers than sellers."
"4805670","4813320"," I wonder why there's so much put buying on silver."
"4819440","4821560"," There's no real resistance above either. "
"4821820","4827000"," I don't think that book map works well on some tickers."
"4827620","4828620"," I think this is one of them."
"4831060","4833660"," 49,000, 50,000 sellers. "
"4834540","4835780"," Look below here."
"4838910","4844170"," The silver trade looks like book map looks great."
"4845290","4849130"," I don't know why there's so many buyers versus sellers on silver. "
"4849750","4852710"," I can't tell if it's just panic or paranoia, maybe."
"4854370","4857330"," I don't know if I'd follow that silver click trade."
"4858390","4860630"," The book map just doesn't show it well. "
"4863170","4864290"," Let's take a look at it."
"4870740","4875640"," See right here and see all this negative connotation even though it's trading where it is."
"4876620","4881900"," My assumption is that this has something to do with the Putin and Biden announcement at 12. "
"4884940","4885820"," If I had to guess."
"4901330","4910990"," We've got more calls on oil February 18, 80C, XOM February 18, 80C for $53,000."
"4914990","4922270"," Calls on FCK, FCK February 18, 42C, $55,000. "
"4922270","4930850"," We've got calls on FCK again April 14, 45C for $1.1 million."
"4932090","4934070"," Look at FCK."
"4953740","4957040"," I don't know why I always say that I always say that I always say FCK and I mean FCX. "
"4967720","4970340"," I always say that I always say FCK and I mean FCX."
"4971680","4989780"," Those calls"
"4989780","4999760"," are April 14, 45C, 5,000 calls at $2.15. It's got a high algo score."
"5004140","5006020"," More buyers and sellers. "
"5010280","5020280"," I can see the trade might be worth watching if FCK trades down at any point or"
"5020280","5029860"," FCX trades down at any point to 40.10. Or if it trades down to like 3762 somewhere down in"
"5029860","5038080"," here, you see any weakness in FCX, then free parmace and then maybe possibly take that trade."
"5039280","5041080"," You see sellers above here 43."
"5042080","5046140"," French 10-year-old yield was down 3 while the 10-year yield is up on the day. "
"5048800","5053660"," Real sellers above it 4576 on FCX."
"5057640","5061960"," Yeah, for all those silver calls coming in, I just watched some gold calls come in."
"5063540","5065820"," I don't think that gold is going to show us much either. "
"5068740","5071120"," But we'll look at it."
"5071760","5081100"," So as gold calls, February 25, 177C per $159,000."
"5102940","5110340"," And talk about the two different tales here. "
"5110440","5113140"," We've got silver's got buyers consuming sellers."
"5113800","5118020"," We've got sellers consuming buyers on gold."
"5118680","5120340"," Per indicator is negative. "
"5122380","5123680"," And gold as well."
"5124600","5130640"," Price target above is 177.85. There's light resistance here."
"5132720","5134940"," I want you guys to look at this kind of stuff. "
"5135260","5138240"," We're looking at gold, right?"
"5139660","5140800"," I don't want you to see."
"5141040","5142880"," So it's kind of a bizarre tale, right?"
"5145320","5148020"," Get this drop back here on gold."
"5148740","5149880"," Now it's climbing again. "
"5150800","5152160"," The here indicator is climbing again."
"5154020","5160400"," The silver here indicator is negative, even though it's going to get more buyers than sellers here."
"5161360","5165980"," And then let's go back and look at the spy and just look at the here indicator on it. "
"5174320","5176780"," Let's go back to 9.30 this morning."
"5184630","5189820"," We're going to bring this back."
"5192960","5195160"," Here, B&B calls March 18, 2025. "
"5195240","5200240"," The highs of the day up about 1.6% now north of 1870 in front month gold."
"5201320","5203640"," The best level since mid-November here for gold."
"5207400","5210420"," Just keep your eyes on this here indicator as the day moves forward. "
"5211160","5215280"," You can see that buyers and sellers are moving it up."
"5215980","5220240"," You can see that the here indicator has been positive since 9.30 this morning."
"5221220","5225160"," There's nothing to say here that the market is negative this morning. "
"5226080","5227220"," Or at least underneath the hood."
"5247050","5253290"," Paul's coming in on BP June 17, 30 C for half a million dollars."
"5284560","5306550"," Got my 41, 5,"
"5306870","5309990"," 9, 4, 42, 7, 4."
"5345400","5346020"," All right. "
"5355300","5356860"," I'm going to look at my four here."
"5368000","5368960"," All right."
"5374860","5380880"," You want to move aggressively on rates and the balance sheet. "
"5381500","5387760"," Worries about an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine remained front and center."
"5387920","5393040"," But commentary from foreign minister Lavrov did sue the markets to some degree."
"5393920","5396500"," Russia, Ukraine tensions are in focus. "
"5396740","5403200"," Risk aversion sentiment dominates as growing geopolitical risks in Ukraine added to broader"
"5403200","5404160"," worries."
"5404420","5405620"," Let me see if I can click on this and get more."
"5412580","5416820"," Risk aversion sentiment dominates as growing cheap lack of risks in Ukraine added to broader"
"5416820","5419820"," worries around aggressive tightening and monetary policy. "
"5422860","5427480"," Various ECB members continue to cool excessive interest rate rise expectations."
"5428300","5430300"," That's Markov, Visco, and Ren."
"5434190","5438590"," I have to go look here and see if there's anything in here that's critical to know. "
"5450070","5456410"," The Russia Foreign Minister Lavrov will propose continuing diplomatic work."
"5456610","5457290"," We really know about that."
"5459440","5462380"," Chairman Chancellor will continue economic aid for Ukraine. "
"5479920","5481720"," There's not much in this market summary right now."
"5481720","5505570"," If I"
"5505570","5511510"," had to assume it's going to be a wait for the president to speak at 1230 to find a movement"
"5511510","5512210"," in the market."
"5513110","5520010"," We've got calls on AMD, February 18th, 125C for $66,000. "
"5522290","5524710"," I want to see if, so they didn't break."
"5525670","5530030"," What I can see here, 435 did not break."
"5530770","5538100"," I was looking in the after hours on the weekend to see if there was any break and see if"
"5538100","5538420"," there was. "
"5540160","5547060"," Yeah, so there was no break down below of 4350 and you need a break of that number for us"
"5547060","5548600"," to visit 420."
"5579700","5583580"," We also have a large bull flag setting up on EES currently."
"5587010","5599700"," Diamondhand, those ZVXY puts, by the way, I'm going"
"5599700","5616050"," to take a look at the one month or 4350. "
"5616270","5618770"," Now I can see on EES where it wants to reject."
"5621120","5625420"," If you don't get the reject, I guess you're looking for the rejection on EES."
"5627400","5628920"," I'm going to make this smaller here. "
"5654450","5659930"," Now you're looking for the rejection on EES at 44.0 and then that would give you the price target"
"5659930","5662370"," down below 4350."
"5663030","5670890"," You want to see a rejection on 4440 to get the break of 4350."
"5671150","5680940"," If you get the break of 4350, that's when you'll see 4200 once again because everything rests on"
"5680940","5681240"," that. "
"5699460","5700260"," Yeah, no."
"5700540","5707420"," My take on the market currently this morning is that we're going to trade with a **** higher at a"
"5707420","5710340"," minimum to 4405."
"5713140","5716980"," If the news is good from Biden, we'll trade higher from there. "
"5717480","5722280"," If you're looking to take a short position, you're going to wait for at least 4405."
"5723280","5732480"," But there is some resistance at 439575 somewhere in there, but I wouldn't take another short right"
"5732480","5732920"," where we are."
"5741730","5751850"," CLF calls, March 4th, 21.5 C, $26,000, CLF calls, March"
"5751850","5755630"," 11th, 20.5 C, $58,000. "
"5757510","5764070"," CLF calls again, March 11th, 20.5 C, $59,000."
"5765270","5770770"," CLF calls again, March 11th, 20.5 C, $47,000."
"5809150","5816050"," CLF calls on CLF, we've got four racks of them, but for like $200,000, 20.5 C,"
"5816850","5827950"," buyers down below at $17.56, again at $18.03, resistance"
"5827950","5834830"," above at $19.20, see if there's an error indicator, I think there's an error indicator for"
"5834830","5841830"," Cleveland, but maybe, and their price target is February 18th, 20.5 C."
"5842850","5852080"," I don't know if they get there unless there's news we don't know about, $19 "
"5852080","5861120",".20 big resistance, price target somewhere up in here, lots of sellers above here, for the Italian"
"5861120","5868740"," banking industry, Italy's intro bank fund approving their carriage stake sale to be reported in"
"5868740","5896880"," Italian press, is that $20.95. More"
"5896880","5902140"," Palantir calls February 25th, 14.5 C, more calls on Neo. "
"5915640","5921060"," All right, so I'm going to, I have to pick a ride up to the corner and get my glasses"
"5921060","5922300"," from my optometrist."
"5923020","5927920"," I will be back, I'm going to leave the feed on, I have to grab some glasses, I will be"
"5927920","5936200"," back by 1215 so that I can be here for the news conference with Biden and Russia."
"5937180","5943800"," I'll leave this stream up and what I'll do is I'll put the headlines down here for you if you"
"5943800","5950300"," want, so you can see as the headlines come in, you can see what they're saying. "
"5952660","5968500"," Let me see if I can bring that back up, market data center, right"
"5968500","5974490"," here, I don't know what this is."
"5995240","6000480"," Yeah, so the, sorry, so there's, I'll post this for you on, so basically what you're looking for"
"6000480","6007260"," on, hold on a second, guys, we'll get back, what I'll do is I'll put, you're listening to trade the"
"6007260","6007740"," news."
"6008400","6015300"," I'm going to put the, I'm going to put what the bears are looking for and what the bulls are"
"6015300","6023220"," looking for here, giving you guys some scope as to what everybody's looking for here. "
"6027820","6037760"," So I'll post this chart, see if I can get a better spy calls, February 16th,"
"6037760","6040540"," 442, this might help, okay."
"6045020","6046960"," So this is tough to show."
"6047260","6052800"," I just think we're going to report on Ukraine, says Russian mercenaries have increased their"
"6052800","6062200"," presence in Ukraine in recent weeks, another indicator of potential invasion, for exciting security"
"6062200","6064300"," sources in western nations. "
"6078290","6091620"," Here we go."
"6118090","6120350"," 4, 4, 5, 0."
"6139640","6145800"," So if news is good, you're going to look for some kind of move like this, I'll post this"
"6162410","6173200"," on Twitter"
"6173200","6173720"," for you."
"6182930","6191430"," I'm going to show you where to take short if you think that the market will continue to sell down. "
"6224790","6229550"," Right here."
"6232890","6241030"," In New York Fed released in a January survey of consumer expectations, expectations survey saying"
"6241030","6248650"," that about a year ahead, price changes for food, rent and gas and medical care all declined by 0.1"
"6248650","6249370"," percentage point."
"6250010","6254790"," Fewer inflation expectations dropped to three and a half percent in the January report. "
"6260050","6263710"," Or 30 minutes now, 30 minutes to the European cash equity close."
"6320360","6328740"," All right, so I'm just about posting the bull case and the bear case on on Twitter."
"6328880","6329900"," So we'll take a look at these real quick. "
"6330060","6339680"," Okay, so on the bull case, you've got a large downward trend on the"
"6339680","6347180"," ES, right, the S&P 500, the ES, and you've got this giant"
"6347180","6354780"," flag that's been going on since the let's call it between the 10th and the 11th, right, where we"
"6354780","6355360"," sold down."
"6356700","6363700"," And the point would be that you're going to lift up, you've got puts that were bought on high at"
"6363700","6363940"," 460."
"6364800","6366900"," We traded down to 435. "
"6368980","6373760"," And so the question would become, no matter what that we're going to spring back up for cheaper"
"6373760","6374540"," puts, right?"
"6374660","6379580"," That's what spot chem is saying this morning that we need cheaper puts so we can rebuy puts again"
"6379580","6381320"," before we take this lower."
"6381440","6385800"," So the bull case would be that we trade higher above 440."
"6387020","6388820"," Let's call it right here. "
"6388820","6396860"," See this area right here, this 441, 442 that we'll trade above this so that puts can get cheap once"
"6396860","6397300"," again."
"6398080","6405020"," Now, spot cameras note this morning is also saying that if we can break above 4410, that we should"
"6405020","6408100"," have a free ride to 4450."
"6408600","6412300"," Now, on the book map, it's showing it a little bit lower. "
"6413200","6421020"," It's showing it currently at 442.96. So be aware of that as we trade, let's say we get a"
"6421020","6427980"," bullish report from Biden in Russia or whatever, and we trade higher right now, currently, it's"
"6427980","6429820"," actually lower than 4450."
"6430440","6442280"," It's at 442.86. There's more sellers above it, 441.92. Now,"
"6442840","6447960"," support and resistance disappear depending upon what news hits us."
"6448920","6450780"," So that's the bull case, right, that we're going to trade higher. "
"6451140","6455760"," We're going to get some good news, trade higher, whatever, in reality, it's more than likely just a"
"6455760","6459920"," chance to reset by cheap puts and take this for another leg lower."
"6460100","6467820"," Now, with that said, the bear case, right, is right now, currently, believe it or not, it's just"
"6467820","6475260"," bears that are stuck in shorts, bought late in shorts, bought on Friday short, or bought the open"
"6475260","6478080"," today with shorts, they're looking for a fat prince."
"6478720","6483840"," The problem, the only problem with that is that puts are expensive right now, right?"
"6484260","6487220"," We know that they were dirt cheap on Friday. "
"6487220","6489200"," We know that they were dirt cheap on Thursday."
"6489940","6493840"," We closed our puts on Friday at the bell, right?"
"6494180","6498500"," And so we're now looking to find out which way, which direction we're going."
"6498660","6501500"," So the second thing that I posted was the bear case. "
"6501720","6506140"," And the bear case is, hey, we're going to take short right where we are at right where we are"
"6506140","6508740"," right now, right at 4385."
"6508740","6511620"," And we're going to push this market down."
"6511880","6512820"," They'll just be full rejection. "
"6513440","6515000"," Fuck the news at 12 o'clock."
"6515140","6516060"," We're getting in right now."
"6516140","6519460"," The reality is that puts are very expensive, right?"
"6519680","6528660"," So you're looking for a trade higher to take short if you're a bear at either 4410 or again, even"
"6528660","6531000"," higher at 4450. "
"6532020","6539920"," Now the key to all of this is regardless if you're a bull or bear, with we trade down for"
"6539920","6545100"," a price target of 4200, you need to break 4350."
"6545800","6550200"," If you don't, if we trade, let's say we trade higher or even we sell down now, and we bounce"
"6550200","6551400"," off 4350."
"6551400","6557300"," Let's say it's just a check down below to the futures on the overnight at five AM. "
"6557700","6559120"," Let's say we, we don't even go higher."
"6559120","6563820"," We just trade down to 4350, but we do not break it."
"6564160","6566300"," That would be uber super duper bullish. "
"6566880","6568960"," You should see a reaction much higher."
"6569760","6571940"," What you really want to see is the break."
"6572180","6575200"," The key level here is 4350. "
"6575720","6581380"," If that is broken, that would be the signal, especially if it's broken and it's not rejected."
"6581380","6584540"," You don't want to see like a break, and then we pull back higher."
"6584560","6590220"," You want to see a break below, and then you want to see a resistance form at 4350. "
"6590220","6596280"," If the resistance forms at 4350, the next target lower is 4200."
"6597000","6606740"," Then you'll see another trade higher, and then we trade down below to that 390 mark that"
"6606740","6613180"," we've given you some perspective of where we are, and perspective on where when bears are telling"
"6613180","6616700"," you to take it short, this is probably not the place."
"6617220","6619980"," Or you could take it short here, but it's expensive to take it short here. "
"6620380","6624000"," All you need is any kind of good news, and your puts and your shorts are fucked."
"6630300","6636180"," We can get a better, so I guess there's three, I guess that you could say that there are three"
"6637080","6638080"," possible outcomes."
"6638780","6640580"," You could see a trade lower to test 40. "
"6640960","6646920"," Let's see if the neutral trade or the super duper bullish trade would be, we trade down to 4350,"
"6647340","6654380"," and just to check on the futures touch below at 4350, and then we rocket ship higher."
"6654960","6661800"," Then you've got the normal bear case, switches that we trade higher and reject off of, let's see"
"6661800","6671880"," here, 4405, 444750, although book maps saying they're different numbers, and"
"6671880","6675260"," you would take a new short there or puts there and we trade lower."
"6676160","6682120"," If you're super duper uber bearish, bears think that we're just going to sell right now, just going"
"6682120","6683320"," to go straight red bar down. "
"6683680","6688680"," We're going to red bar down to 4350, and then we're going to red bar down to 4020, 40 zero,"
"6688880","6689280"," excuse me."
"6691620","6694640"," So you have to place your bets on both of these trades, I guess."
"6701360","6709320"," Yeah, it looks to me like the, what it looks like to me is it looks like they're selling puts"
"6709320","6716880"," to bears, and they're selling oil to bears, and they're selling silver and gold to bears, and then"
"6716880","6717840"," they're going to let it go higher. "
"6720710","6723770"," And then you buy more cheap puts, and then we'll short it again."
"6724490","6725430"," That's what it looks like."
"6725770","6732570"," This looks like the same thing that happens to bulls above, and we're at 460, this is what it"
"6732570","6732910"," looked like. "
"6733330","6738610"," That doesn't mean we don't trade down from here, but the overall look of it to me is that we're"
"6738610","6743290"," tracking a trade higher here, and it's just a matter of unloading all these puts on bears."
"6745570","6751050"," We got more oxy puts coming in February 25th, 40p for $98,000."
"6777900","6786320"," Now leave this up here, and I'll be back. "
"6786460","6787600"," It should take me just half an hour."
"6787700","6790160"," I've got to drive like 10 minutes up the road."
"6790560","6792460"," I have ordered my glasses, left them there. "
"6792560","6795600"," I haven't been able to pick them up because I'm live stream with you guys every day, and I can't"
"6795600","6796740"," have anybody else pick them up for me."
"6796780","6798040"," So I got to take a drive up."
"6798360","6798820"," I'll be back. "
"6799780","6800440"," Hopefully, not hopefully."
"6800640","6806240"," I should be back before 1215 or so when Biden speaks, and place your bets."
"6806460","6807580"," I guess you know what else you could place?"
"6807980","6815320"," You could place a straddle on the market as if the whatever that presser is, if it's negative, we"
"6815320","6816980"," should trade straight down. "
"6817640","6820980"," But if there's any positive connotation to that presser, we should trade higher."
"6827280","6837700"," I'll bring this down for you so that you can see the headlines"
"6837700","6844860"," as they come in because not all the headlines are being verbally talked about."
"6846180","6849800"," We'll leave them up or I'll leave them up for you so you can see them. "
"6859510","6862130"," Yeah, Winky, that those puts printed fat bro."
"6867180","6868840"," See if that helps there."
"6876720","6882400"," This is helping you guys to see the news as it comes in here. "
"6886690","6891790"," So not all of this news that's here is verbalized, right?"
"6898280","6899080"," W right back."

"10072330","10075590"," All right, so what's going on with the market since I've been gone?"
"10075750","10083330"," You can see the resistance is weakening above here at 4.41. Looks like they came down to try to"
"10083330","10084830"," sell the market down."
"10085430","10090250"," And now we're getting more sellers higher, right?"
"10090570","10091430"," You can see it over here. "
"10091810","10093170"," We're wearing out sellers here."

"10109230","10112930"," Over time, we end up turning up unless there's some kind of news in either direction."
"10113930","10115970"," So you can't predict everything, of course."
"10116930","10121970"," But we are, if you look on the chart for like any kind of 5-day chart, 10-day or"
"10121970","10126290"," 10-day, 30-day chart, it looks like we are creating a bottom here. "

"10133450","10137530"," We trade it outside of our trading zone and it's trying to recapture that now."
"10137530","10141930"," I'm assuming that's we're still waiting on news for 12-1 o'clock this afternoon."
"10145190","10147350"," Watching spy calls currently, right?"
"10147690","10148850"," I'm going to see if I can bring up. "
"10150930","10152230"," Yeah, it heads up on Walmart."
"10152470","10153090"," I used to trade Walmart."
"10153930","10159260"," I think they have a, oh, really?"
"10159640","10162960"," I have a Costco membership and I haven't been there for glasses. "
"10164160","10165300"," So I'll have to go there."
"10166840","10169040"," I was so upset when I was just down there right now."
"10169040","10171880"," I was going to cancel and get a refund. "
"10172920","10175600"," It's like my local, my local place."
"10177620","10180800"," Yeah, it looks like Tesla traded to 900, right?"
"10181280","10182240"," Which is nice to see."
"10184830","10186330"," Tesla wound up trading 900. "
"10187290","10187690"," Shocker."
"10191390","10193210"," VIX is kind of hanging on."
"10194390","10195610"," It's not really doing much. "
"10195890","10199330"," I'm assuming that UVXY calls must be printing fucking huge right now."
"10199530","10199870"," I don't know."
"10200570","10202390"," I'm going to doubt that bullshit too. "
"10207170","10208470"," What else are we looking at here?"
"10210690","10216630"," More Uber calls, more SOFI calls, GM calls."
"10218430","10219950"," This is a moment though in the market."
"10220150","10221910"," You, I do like to look at Tesla. "
"10222290","10223990"," We talked about it going to 900."
"10225150","10229330"," And you'll want to see if we can break above there or not."
"10230250","10232450"," There is some resistance on Tesla. "
"10232950","10235570"," Tesla's become a better bow weather for the market."
"10236010","10239670"," So we'll take a look at Tesla right now and see if it can break higher or not."
"10240030","10246210"," Because this can be a moment in the market where that we do trade back due to like a Tesla"
"10246210","10247590"," being at resistance, right?"
"10247810","10248390"," So we'll take a look. "
"10249450","10254470"," But if you do see Tesla break above 900, you will see the market move way higher."
"10256540","10258220"," So let that load up and see what's going on."
"10260020","10265700"," And yeah, I'm going to stick with my same, I'm going to stick with my same thought process here. "
"10266800","10270060"," And this is the same as this is the same currently at the moment."
"10275000","10278720"," It reminds me of, you know, bulls being at the top, you want to see it, you want to see"
"10278720","10281120"," us trade higher and then buy cheap books again."
"10284860","10287420"," But we'll look at Tesla and see if it's had resistance. "
"10288240","10293420"," Because if Tesla's had resistance, which it was earlier at right, right around 900, if Tesla's had"
"10293420","10299900"," resistance and can't trade higher on some kind of news or the market can't trade higher on some"
"10299900","10301840"," kind of news, we might not get any higher here."
"10302380","10308420"," So my assumption is that we're waiting for something from Russia, believe it or not."
"10308540","10312660"," I don't know why it's Russian news, but I'm assuming that it is. "
"10314760","10323800"," Oh, on the Walmart, just on a note on Walmart, if you are going to trade Walmart earnings, not"
"10323800","10327080"," always, but sometimes they tend to, you don't see the kick."
"10327340","10331260"," If it's a good ER, you won't see a trade higher right afterwards."
"10332840","10334160"," Well, that's a tough one to trade. "
"10335000","10337240"," I've only been successful with spreads on it."
"10338900","10341060"," Never on calls or puts."
"10351200","10353180"," Yeah, so you want to make sure this isn't a bull trap. "
"10354600","10356380"," You can see these sellers above."
"10356680","10364020"," So we go from, you know, 36,800, you know, just be conscious of this right here, right?"
"10364280","10370180"," You've got, you know, 19,000 sellers, 20,000 sellers, 30,000 sellers."
"10370520","10374780"," And then you go to, right at 900, you've got three times the sellers. "
"10375120","10379440"," This is the one part of the market here that is concerning me today."
"10379960","10385000"," And this is where you have bulls that were, you know, like fed."
"10385600","10388920"," This is the bottom we're going up from here, but this is back in January. "
"10389360","10395260"," It's on spokesperson Kirby and then press interviews saying that Russia's Putin gives himself more"
"10395260","10398040"," military options with each passing day."
"10401590","10408030"," So the one thing about January 20th is that up here in this, you know, like you would, you would"
"10408030","10410110"," have said, or anyone was saying, right?"
"10410350","10415310"," You all you heard everywhere, like the nonstop fucking throw up was we hammered out a bottom."
"10415670","10416750"," We're trading higher from here. "
"10417190","10418150"," We shouldn't go any lower."
"10418370","10422550"," You had Jabrowski or Jabowaski, Gerber."
"10422850","10429670"," And you got all these guys, you've got Blackwater, all these hedge funds saying, don't worry by"
"10429670","10430090"," this dip. "
"10430310","10430890"," This is the one."
"10432490","10437530"," And then after the sell off on Thursday, Friday, you've got, now you've got bulls that are scared."
"10438150","10440710"," And we didn't have bulls that were scared. "
"10441390","10446750"," I know when you watched it on CNBC, you watched it everywhere, where bulls are saying this is"
"10446750","10448750"," bottom at 420, we're never going any lower."
"10449590","10457310"," And the selling on Thursday, Friday, change that narrative amongst bulls, even if you don't see it,"
"10457690","10459230"," you may or may not see it."
"10459270","10461390"," I think we see it more over the weekend. "
"10461590","10466110"," I thought we saw more bulls say, believe we're not at bottom, right?"
"10466830","10469230"," And maybe you're not even going to retest 420."
"10469290","10471090"," We might go even deeper than 420."
"10471670","10481630"," And they weren't saying that that wasn't the narrative on the last, on the, that wasn't the"
"10481630","10483150"," narrative before Thursday. "
"10483710","10486730"," So this is of concern right here."
"10486930","10489790"," This, you've got three times the sellers hiding right above 900."
"10489790","10493150"," I'm going to assume that that's some kind of bull panic above here. "
"10493770","10502830"," And for this to switch, you're going to need to see market to find market news today that would"
"10502830","10503350"," trade us higher."
"10503350","10505210"," I don't think you're going to see it in the overnight."
"10505750","10507550"," I don't think anyone's, oh, let's see it. "
"10510960","10516960"," I don't think you'll see in the overnight a switch to where all markets get lifted up."
"10517700","10523340"," When you see this level of sellers hiding on Tesla."
"10529320","10533540"," So I'm still going to assume you're going to need some news. "
"10533900","10537360"," And you're hearing this news come out, I think the past couple of hours you've heard things like,"
"10537920","10543420"," there's mercenaries and just this news you just heard right now."
"10543920","10550480"," The Department of Defense spokesperson Kirby, Russia president Putin gives himself more military"
"10550480","10555040"," options with each passing day."
"10557580","10559440"," It's not really the news you're looking for. "
"10559540","10563320"," The news that you're looking for is whatever this coming out today at."
"10565670","10572810"," Whatever's coming out today with the, it has more to do with like the U.S. dollar to the Ruble"
"10572810","10579290"," E.M. U.S. dollar to U.A.H. to the C.E. 4.F.X. E.S.R. and"
"10579290","10581350"," R.S.X. doesn't have to do as much with the spy."
"10584930","10587770"," This is all as the European macro news news. "
"10588590","10592210"," Looks like it's intended to talk about the European markets."
"10594730","10596910"," So we'll look at Tesla once more."
"10597430","10598830"," And that is the only concern. "
"10599150","10605490"," You want to, I'm using Tesla not fully but, you know, you don't want to see this many sellers above"
"10605490","10605790"," here."
"10606210","10607790"," You want to see these sellers go away."
"10608370","10610090"," You can see too, it's 94,000. "
"10610190","10616350"," You want to see this come down to like 30, 40, 50,000, maybe 60,000 for the markets to"
"10616350","10616710"," move higher."
"10624560","10630600"," Now it does also make you wonder do they burn the market today and then trade it higher or lower"
"10630600","10631060"," tomorrow."
"10636890","10639770"," Yeah, I saw some news saying the ECB is backing away from rate hikes. "
"10644480","10650220"," Put them back off while barking, it won't look weak."
"10651120","10654400"," Yeah, I don't think that that's the most negative news in the market right now."
"10654780","10656580"," I think that's more noise you're looking for. "
"10659340","10660800"," Is there war or not?"
"10666580","10672440"," It doesn't, it's the other ramifications on the war or if there's war that's more concerning."
"10672780","10675100"," It's not so much does the U.S. get involved or not."
"10675100","10677400"," But there's potential for the U.S. to get involved. "
"10678160","10682000"," You know that in the past we've had civilian airlines be shot down."
"10691820","10699180"," Someone said this morning that it doesn't matter if we sanction Russia because of their ties to"
"10699180","10699520"," China."
"10705090","10710470"," The Pentagon's spokesperson Kirby Singh is not ruled out possible cyber tax from Russia. "
"10716940","10718540"," And jets are up this morning."
"10718780","10721700"," Jets are up 1.53 percent."
"10722200","10725580"," So the market's telling you something different than what the news is telling you today. "
"10734720","10736900"," I haven't seen those puts yet on the queues."
"10737740","10739480"," How much strike price?"
"10741100","10742300"," Yeah, I'm still holding calls."
"10744120","10748860"," I'm still long and I'm going to stay long until something changes. "
"10748860","10756160"," And then what I'll do is I'll buy protective puts once again, but not where we are."
"10760930","10762870"," Unless there's some other news that we don't know."
"10782860","10791710"," Yeah, everything says we trade out. "
"10793190","10794230"," It's 1216."
"10794530","10795750"," We should have some news out."
"10798070","10799410"," I think there's a press. "
"10799410","10803930"," Is there anyone confirmed that there's a press at 1230 on Biden?"
"10804830","10806430"," And I can't see it anywhere."
"10822390","10824650"," Yeah, and Amazon did just trade."
"10824930","10827070"," Amazon's traded up now to 3163. "
"10829950","10832670"," So they have taken back everything they gave up on Friday."
"10834870","10837710"," Tesla, same thing right up around 900, right?"
"10839610","10840530"," Look at Apple."
"10845100","10846300"," Apple's not quite. "
"10847560","10859520"," Apple's high off the bell was 172.80. They're now at their closing price of"
"10859520","10859960"," Friday."
"10860360","10863400"," So we are at a moment right now in the market where we're either going to start selling."
"10863960","10865800"," Facebook's not really doing shit, right?"
"10867100","10868580"," Facebook's just kind of dog shit. "
"10868580","10870240"," B.A. calls right now."
"10871320","10874400"," February 18th 220 C for $112,000."
"10883590","10892430"," Also some calls coming in on K.W.E.B. I never traded it because of the politics, but it's"
"10892430","10898490"," worth a note that there are calls on February 25th 36.5 C hundred fifty thousand dollars. "
"10906750","10909230"," Also calls on TNA."
"10911110","10914210"," Which is the three times bully TF."
"10915390","10916650"," We have four small caps. "
"10917330","10920290"," February 18th 67 C, $56,000."
"10922030","10923230"," Loads of spy calls."
"10926290","10931130"," The assumption would be placed here bets right where we are and see if we trade higher or not. "
"10956030","10957490"," I'm looking around the market right now."
"10957670","10965790"," Everything is sitting, you know, it's kind of funny when you're always, you're sitting, you know,"
"10965790","10967790"," I'm looking at all these different tickers right now."
"10968190","10969890"," Everything looks like it's bearish, right?"
"10970030","10974450"," Like it's going to roll over about the same time. "
"10978710","10980970"," Cudel is looking very bullish right now."
"10983510","10986130"," But 94.62 we'll take a look at Cudel."
"10988950","10993970"," I've been wanting to enter a trade on Cudel for a few days, two to three days now I think. "
"11004440","11028460"," So let's go look at Cudel and see what's going on."
"11033990","11035790"," Great buyers on Cudel."
"11036370","11042200"," I think that Winky brought this one up the other day. "
"11050470","11053390"," 11,000 buyers to 6,000 sellers."
"11057570","11059670"," I think they have a, they"
"11061110","11070990"," have a"
"11077200","11078180"," two-day trade."
"11078180","11079180"," The earnings are in two days. "
"11080420","11083560"," Could be a good trade here with the Cudel."
"11086160","11087680"," Earnings are in two days."
"11094620","11096140"," Let's see if we can see one there. "
"11101370","11102850"," They're kind of under the radar too."
"11105790","11115950"," So I'm"
"11115950","11116730"," still watching them."
"11117410","11122750"," The trade is low as 93.17. They're resting on support. "
"11123070","11127710"," It looks like they could trade as low as 90.60. Price target above though is 106."
"11129670","11131810"," They get a lot of buyers stepping in."
"11133990","11136890"," So I do like this trade a lot still. "
"11138510","11140870"," There might be something where you're just buying shares."
"11143910","11145410"," I'll just keep monitoring it."
"11146090","11151250"," Does anybody know, hey Winky, do you know when the, is there E.R. before or after?"
"11155920","11157620"," White House has something at 230. "
"11163940","11170000"," Yeah, and that said earlier today it said, I like a SE by the way, John."
"11180970","11183690"," Yeah, it's on a, it's on a fucking bull flag right now."
"11188280","11189400"," It's actually trading higher. "
"11190740","11192280"," It is on a bull flag."
"11192480","11198280"," It's low today was at 94.27. Right at support."
"11204180","11206000"," When is there E.R. is it a morning?"
"11206260","11206780"," I'll look it up. "
"11207360","11209600"," Let's find out when Cudel's E.R. report is."
"11219050","11222050"," That's down 1.36% today."
"11223970","11226870"," It's after market close in the 17th. "
"11248300","11250300"," No one's really paying attention to it."
"11267250","11269370"," They just got some good news."
"11281690","11287830"," Are they the preliminary announcement that revs for fourth quarter 2021 are estimated to be 60 or"
"11287830","11289750"," 633 to 637 mill?"
"11295970","11297410"," It's like they trade on news. "
"11297830","11307510"," They've got, they're waiting for a facility in Rutherford, California to become fully operational"
"11307510","11313690"," manufacturing capacity constraints are likely to wait on the company's performance in the 2B"
"11313690","11313970"," quarter."
"11314290","11317530"," So you're going to be looking for news on a facility that we're opening."
"11324110","11324910"," I'd call them up. "
"11340940","11342400"," It's got a high ranking in Zex."
"11346720","11347620"," They'll be looking for news."
"11347860","11350620"," I'd call them up and ask them when there's a new facility open. "
"11351080","11353720"," I'd be surprised the people will answer that show on the phone sometimes."
"11365890","11383010"," They'll have"
"11383010","11383850"," just some shares."
"11384670","11385570"," Yeah, I like the idea of shares. "
"11389090","11389350"," All right, John."
"11389550","11391250"," We'll look at the, we'll look at SC next, bro."
"11392030","11393350"," I like, I used to love trading SC. "
"11394570","11395670"," SC was free money."
"11397090","11401090"," I used to trade this and it was, I could trade this and not play any other plays, and it"
"11401090","11401690"," just made money."
"11405430","11407950"," So we can see if we're going to break above this resistance here. "
"11412790","11414210"," All these spy sellers."
"11415090","11420650"," There was something else, I'll show you guys this right here, to read this to you."
"11421530","11427830"," So the New York Stock Exchange volume is 314 million shares, 12% above its three month average. "
"11429510","11433970"," Decliners led advances, 9 to 1.9 to 1.9 to 1."
"11434710","11440470"," NASDAQ volume is 1.78 billion shares, 23% below its three month average."
"11440770","11445350"," That shows why NASDAQ's moving up and spies in rotation."
"11453960","11461280"," More SLV puts silver, 325, 21p, the silver and gold going down. "
"11466840","11469320"," Yeah, silver's been going down since open, right?"
"11470200","11472220"," Looks like those puts are printing slightly."
"11474920","11477760"," This does look like rotation long in the market."
"11479100","11482580"," That is what it looks like, whatever you're going to say to it. "
"11497560","11499040"," Spy trading higher now."
"11503940","11513770"," Now I do want you to know if we do trade sideways like this, the"
"11513770","11516410"," longer that we trade sideways trying to break through and above."
"11517870","11519750"," That the bulls can't do it, we'll trade lower. "
"11520530","11522750"," The bulls have to put something on here."
"11523870","11527590"," The bulls got to make a move."
"11534560","11536080"," That's got the big picture on SE. "
"11543610","11545750"," Lots of buyers and accumulation on SE."
"11547090","11551210"," I don't know if everybody here has, I know John has experienced trading SE."
"11553310","11554930"," SE is a paying trade. "
"11558890","11560910"," Where you enter is key on SE."
"11562870","11571690"," All the buyers are down at 120.67. It's like the next round of buyers at 125.39 were trading"

"11671430","11672930"," no worries John."
"11674950","11680190"," If you guys ever want to trade SE, there are some great communities out there."
"11680330","11685710"," That's all they trade SE and they get bullish and bearish back and forth. "
"11686710","11689830"," Just find guys that trade SE and they'll tell you when to enter and when to sell."
"11689830","11693450"," So we'll see if the spy can break above here."
"11693690","11698430"," If not, this would be a place to take shorts if you're super duper bearish. "
"11698430","11702110"," If not, we'll see this trade higher."
"11702390","11707030"," If this does trade higher, you will see shorts start to squeeze."

"11857490","11861870"," I said they were going to do an announcement at $12.30. It looks like the only announcement they"
"11861870","11867330"," had was they're offering $1 billion in low give loan guarantees to calm the market concerns."
"11868710","11873470"," Well, that's a trade on EEM who saw K-Web calls come in earlier."
"11885520","11890160"," So Russian news, Shoyu is saying part of the military trading coming to an end. "

"11901540","11905820"," sent sent home even if they're trying to save face, right?"
"11907240","11909600"," You should see some pressures off of the market."
"11909800","11913380"," You can't say that there's not pressure on the market if there's going to be a war in Europe."
"11913600","11914260"," I mean, you just can't. "
"11916080","11919520"," But if there's any kind of de-escalation, even if they're just claiming that their training is"
"11919520","11922380"," going away, you will see pressure come off our markets."
"11926480","11928080"," Yeah, you guys heard that too, right?"
"11928340","11933240"," Yeah, I heard that same news earlier today that there would be a oppressor today at $12.30 and I'm"
"11933240","11933840"," not seeing anything."
"11933840","11936840"," I'll look to see on maybe Bloomberg's got some. "
"11951970","11953750"," Man, the guard, he's all over the fucker."
"11954110","11955450"," Is Lagard our female or our male?"
"11956010","11959130"," We have more calls coming in on plug coming in all morning."
"11959130","11960630"," February 18th, 24C. "
"11961330","11962610"," Take a look at plug real quick."
"11966650","11970450"," I mean, I don't see any other bad news that we have the three."
"11970910","11973290"," We've got the truckers, right?"
"11973670","11974490"," Truckers, bad news. "
"11975550","11979810"," We know some of this news is manufactured, but we've got the trucker news that is the negative"
"11979810","11980130"," news."
"11980750","11983570"," We have Russia, Ukraine, war, which was bad news."
"11984530","11993470"," And then we've got the right thing, which is which is already known, but used to amplify bad news. "
"11994070","12003960"," I don't know about this plug plug play"
"12003960","12004480"," right here."
"12006740","12010360"," Unless somebody knows something we don't know or there's some news that I don't know in plug."
"12014080","12015920"," I'd be wary of those calls. "
"12018320","12019700"," Maybe there's something I don't know."
"12021560","12025160"," Just looking at the book map and then I'll look at the chart."
"12032090","12035790"," Yeah, I don't know about that chart on plug why there's still calls coming in. "
"12039150","12040030"," That's tough play."
"12040350","12042890"," I mean, buyers were in and plug at 17 bucks."
"12050910","12051810"," That's tough call. "
"12053790","12056970"," Got a wave of sellers up in here just begging to get out."
"12057450","12063210"," $22.40, $22.57. Maybe they got some news they don't know about."
"12067820","12072080"," Spy calls February 14, 4.41 C for $150,000. "
"12076830","12079570"," And my assumption is we trade higher, even if it isn't to the bell."
"12081310","12087910"," I always forget if it's a male or female."
"12093610","12095910"," Christine Lagarde, Linda. "
"12096750","12103950"," I don't know, Linda's the novelist, but Christine is the French politician."
"12104350","12104710"," I always forget."
"12105710","12106750"," We got a lot going on here. "
"12107910","12108710"," I thought it was a female."
"12109610","12112690"," I wouldn't have said female if I didn't think there was a female, but I was like, I forgot, is"
"12112690","12113850"," that a few women or a man?"
"12115010","12115830"," That is a woman."
"12124380","12125380"," You guys want to see Tesla?"
"12129760","12131900"," Yeah, this all looks like rotation back into spy. "
"12135200","12135760"," We'll see."
"12139540","12141280"," How long is the rotation back into spy?"
"12142980","12143820"," Fuck if I know."
"12148350","12157970"," Technically, we didn't break $43.50. Technically, we won't see $4.20 until we do break $43 "
"12157970","12165110",".50. We have to break it to see $4.20. It's a requirement. "
"12167270","12171530"," Even if we just break through for a moment, it's a requirement."
"12173730","12178950"," Whenever you see guys on Twitter, there's some traders on Twitter that we'll be watching"
"12178950","12182290"," specifically for key numbers to be broken."
"12184210","12188450"," And when those numbers are not broken, it's a technical. "
"12190190","12191670"," It's for the algorithms."
"12192110","12194010"," The algorithms need to see certain things happen."
"12195110","12201090"," For more spy calls, we'll let Tesla load up. "
"12206550","12207610"," Yeah, I got a run."
"12207750","12209370"," I got Tesla coming up right now for you."
"12212750","12213530"," And I'll do Roblox. "
"12217780","12219820"," My only concern here is again, right?"
"12221420","12224060"," Tesla needs to break above a wall of sellers."
"12225000","12232760"," The only bear case that I can see is that bulls are more scared than they were the last time"
"12232760","12242660"," we hit $4.20. We'll come back to Tesla to load up."
"12255740","12257700"," Again, some lag here on book map. "
"12259880","12262240"," I wonder if I got something going on in the background."
"12265540","12275520"," I don't know what"
"12275520","12276840"," this camera hub thing is."
"12279300","12280640"," This is some kind of like. "
"12292600","12296680"," As you're pretty much looking for, you've got more buyers and sellers."
"12297140","12299260"," Hero indicators start to turn negative on it."
"12299900","12302220"," Pairs are starting to step back in again here. "
"12313140","12314720"," See if we can see the Hero indicator."
"12316060","12326160"," You know, so right when we touched above here, back at $12.30. Looks"
"12326160","12327580"," like they put some more puts on."
"12330540","12339420"," If you're looking at the Smith Day traders perspective, the buyers are down here at $50. "
"12340160","12343640"," They're selling $900 back to $50 selling $900."
"12344640","12348760"," You want to see this wall of buyers stepping in."
"12350460","12356600"," Of note though, there were 90,000 sellers on Tesla prior, and now we do see sellers coming down and"
"12356600","12360260"," get $109,000 sellers on Tesla currently right here. "
"12365020","12366360"," Yeah, it looks like a rotation."
"12367480","12370280"," This looks like a rotation into spy into all of the."
"12376170","12378090"," So it's not really how we look here. "
"12378350","12379370"," You guys got to see that."
"12380710","12382850"," Well, you need to be looking at the Dom over here, okay?"
"12383710","12385510"," It's important that you look at the Dom over here."
"12386330","12387090"," Dom the Dom. "
"12388470","12390730"," Yeah, 108,000 sellers here, right?"
"12392790","12396290"," You got 400,000 sellers above at $950."
"12396910","12397710"," It's going to take some work."
"12398010","12399330"," This doesn't just go away. "
"12401090","12404850"," You know, even if we trade up to $950 on Tesla, this doesn't go away."
"12405030","12408990"," These sellers, these are monster sellers above here on Tesla."
"12410490","12415110"," My assumption is that like a guy like me, Kevin has it has sway over. "
"12420810","12424790"," Yeah, 1,000, you've got a 297,000 sellers."
"12428070","12429250"," And it's not just me, Kevin."
"12429410","12432810"," If you check out his cohorts out there, they all did videos. "
"12433130","12437210"," I didn't watch them all, but I watched some of their videos over the weekend for like five minutes."
"12437590","12444570"," And some of them putting up videos saying it looks like the market's going to go down for the next"
"12444570","12445370"," three to four months."
"12445610","12446750"," Like everybody's switching over that. "
"12446750","12452950"," So we talked about a right shoulder on spy last week and the week before forming, right?"
"12453170","12454630"," And now everybody did videos this weekend."
"12456030","12461670"," Like a week late saying, oh, there's a shoulder now for even the bears."
"12462230","12464590"," Didn't put that those videos out until this weekend. "
"12465790","12469130"," And we've been posting right shoulder posts on Twitter."
"12470130","12474970"," And we did a video or two last week about the right shoulder forming at least a week ago."
"12477010","12478710"," Before it formed quote unquote. "
"12479610","12481690"," So you don't want to be late to the trade too, right?"
"12481810","12482950"," That's part of the key, right?"
"12483630","12487910"," As oftentimes you'll get videos made on YouTube and they're fucking late."
"12488790","12490250"," They're always fucking late."
"12490450","12493410"," They're like a week late, the day late, week late, whatever. "
"12495550","12497990"," And you don't want to be late to those that information."
"12498010","12501730"," You want to know that they're there prior to, especially when we're most bullish."
"12502690","12504630"," And the same thing goes for being for today, right?"
"12504850","12505730"," Where we are today. "
"12506730","12508990"," Should you have a bullish or a bear stance?"
"12510530","12511250"," I don't know."
"12511450","12513610"," I don't like this right here as being in 900."
"12514590","12521030"," Get some more of VIX puts coming in February 18th, 23 P for $200,000 more spy calls. "
"12523890","12527350"," And I don't like us being right here on Tesla."
"12527610","12532270"," I would like to see Tesla like, you know, back down at 8.30. And us be where we are"
"12532270","12535270"," right now so that I could know that Tesla has room to trade higher."
"12544430","12546650"," Let's check XLF and XLU. "
"12549190","12550750"," Those can give us some viewpoint."
"12552230","12553810"," Yeah, I like XLF where it is."
"12554510","12556090"," I like the XLF trade right now. "
"12560050","12562150"," And I like the XLU trade right now."
"12563350","12575080"," The XLU fell off a cliff today down to 65.82. And"
"12575080","12576180"," it hasn't been that low."
"12578020","12580280"," Now you're gonna take a look at XLU and..."
"12583160","12587220"," So XLU hasn't been this low since February 30th. "
"12588560","12590940"," Excuse me, November 30th."
"12594700","12598400"," Let's spend this, it was this low back on January 26th."
"12598840","12601320"," As a matter of fact, I might be buying some XLU calls here. "
"12603440","12605980"," Open up a browser, take a look at XLU."
"12605980","12608980"," You got a three-month chart."
"12618500","12619420"," I don't know. "
"12624950","12626430"," Might have a nice trade in it still."
"12626770","12627210"," Maybe not."
"12627810","12629830"," Looks like seasonally it dumps right now. "
"12630630","12632070"," Dumps into March."
"12635330","12641270"," Dumps from now into March on XLU right in previous years, especially in 2020."
"12644230","12645570"," Excuse me, 2021. "
"12649840","12652260"," Right around now, it's dumped into..."
"12685850","12688550"," So we'll see if we can trade up into $443 or so."
"12693460","12697760"," If you look at XLU, this is like a bad, bad time of year for XLU."
"12697880","12705460"," It'll tend to trade down from now into, let's see, maybe I'm not gonna buy. "
"12705460","12709080"," I said that I was interested in buying some XLU."
"12710320","12718800"," Probably be interested in shorting XLU down to $64 or so."
"12724090","12727210"," Into college mid-March. "
"12728070","12734230"," It's late March because it's Linsky saying they want peace that are competent in their army, which"
"12734230","12736450"," is what's stronger than it was a few years ago."
"12741090","12750090"," Maybe a call for Spy to be super-redurable bullish for until we hit a price target of"
"12750090","12759030"," $443, possibly $450, and then look to re-enter short again."
"12766960","12770120"," Yeah, so I show what I do is I reset. "
"12770480","12771740"," Yeah, I reset every session."
"12771740","12775500"," And the other thing too is I need to start resetting."
"12776960","12779760"," I need to start resetting after hedging flow too. "
"12781100","12782620"," I think it'll show a better..."
"12784360","12790700"," I think I have a feeling that the hedging activity, so if they're selling puts, right?"
"12791880","12794280"," If puts are being so, here's how it goes."
"12794680","12801360"," So if there's active hedging and the prop desk is buying puts, right?"
"12802820","12808940"," Then you want to know that in its impact on Hero Indicator."
"12810100","12816520"," And then you want to see if they're selling puts in whatever hedges you see come through on flow,"
"12817360","12821860"," but not buying puts alongside it. "
"12821920","12825780"," I think it gives a different Hero Indicator."
"12826240","12827100"," Does that make sense to me?"
"12827100","12831740"," I'm not doing enough of it describing this dumb enough, dumbing it down enough."
"12832120","12839060"," So some days you'll see major hedging activity, and that's when the market's rolling over. "
"12839860","12842320"," Then other days you'll see us down in the day."
"12842500","12849280"," You'll see tons of hedging activity come in, spy calls across the board just loading the boat."
"12851760","12856840"," Then other days you'll see the Hero Indicator will look negative, but it's on, we're on the wrong"
"12856840","12858020"," side of the trade. "
"12859320","12866300"," So I've been resetting my Hero Indicator every day rather than let it run over."
"12866940","12874200"," I don't know, maybe we could do it every 10 days or so, like a 21-day moving average."
"12875760","12881540"," But I don't know that it, I think it gives it false readings over time. "
"12890730","12892130"," I've been resetting in the morning."
"12894070","12896550"," I've been resetting it before the start of every day."
"12897890","12900750"," So there's a clean picture as to what's actually taking place for that day. "
"12901270","12911170"," I feel like sometimes I think the Brent has even said that he"
"12911170","12920630"," doesn't give charting outside of just a few days because if you give like a Hero Indicator over a"
"12920630","12922570"," month, it doesn't really work."
"12925920","12929680"," And that even just the day's flow can change the direction of the market."
"12930840","12933980"," So you could look at like a whole month and be like, yeah, we're going here. "
"12935340","12940700"," And then just one day of relentless calls or relentless puts will send us, we'll fuck the whole"
"12940700","12941340"," entire thing up."
"12945410","12947170"," But Hero Indicator has been green all day long."
"12948630","12950490"," I program all day long. "
"12951010","12954650"," I don't know how long this rotation lasts and how high we go from this."
"12957310","12961410"," I'll be looking to get some puts somewhere around 443."
"12963990","12965750"," And even higher, right?"
"12967610","12970090"," Right around this 450. "
"12970770","12972090"," I guess the way you'd say is this."
"12973430","12979850"," I guess what you could do is, if you're bearish still, I would say get in the money puts that"
"12979850","12982190"," expire one to three months out right now."
"12983690","12986850"," Put spreads, excuse me, like in the money 440Ps. "
"12987910","12988970"," I wouldn't say a month."
"12989030","12991050"," I'd say like the March OPEX."
"12992850","12996870"," And then maybe even a month after, I don't know. "
"12997250","12999750"," Maybe a week or two after the March OPEX."
"13000630","13005530"," Maybe let's say call like March 31st in the money put spreads you could buy here."
"13008310","13010830"," And then the second problem is this though, if you're bearish. "
"13012370","13016990"," You're looking then to enter some puts at 450."
"13018370","13024830"," And truly, you don't start selling the market until you get up around 460 again, right?"
"13027090","13029010"," 458 could call it slightly lower."
"13029470","13031870"," You could say I'll go balls deep short. "
"13034390","13042770"," And somewhere around 453, you could start putting some heavy bearish trades on."
"13043590","13050190"," But right now, I don't know what to say to you."
"13050470","13052410"," I can see the bear case here. "
"13053530","13056990"," But if you don't want to lose all your money, then I wouldn't be taking short here."
"13057390","13062710"," Well, maybe it's, I mean, I guess you can see some short behavior coming in right where we stand"
"13062710","13063290"," right now."
"13065390","13067590"," I get the idea, but I just don't think that. "
"13069710","13072830"," I would get the, I would get some put spreads here right where we are."
"13073890","13082390"," Date them far out and then wait for the rollover to get a real nasty short."
"13082870","13090170"," If the rollover doesn't happen, you stay inside your put spreads and trade the market higher to the"
"13090170","13090650"," next level. "
"13090650","13092610"," We've been, this is how we do this around here, right?"
"13097300","13104320"," Here I'll, I'll post this, I'll post this on, I'll post this on Twitter so you guys can get a"
"13104320","13105120"," feel for what I'm saying."
"13118160","13126280"," So if you're a bear, 1, 2, 3."
"13127000","13127340"," Okay."
"13128520","13132200"," So let's have, we'll have this conversation or see if you guys understand what I'm saying. "
"13137870","13141870"," So while showing the market, they talked to Joe Donut about this all the time."
"13143590","13145570"," This is a non-stop conversation."
"13145670","13148070"," We've had it a thousand fucking times. "
"13153120","13159400"," Okay, so if you guys open up at Captain's Alpha, I'll look to see if any of you have requested"
"13159400","13162400"," to follow, so you guys can follow along if you're listening in right now."
"13165840","13169100"," Okay, let's say you're bearish the market, right?"
"13169560","13171180"," Overall bearish the market."
"13171180","13180000"," We already know that we're bearish until we get to the large downward channel, right?"
"13180460","13181400"," The other day was at 460. "
"13182420","13186740"," We want to see us trade sideways, that makes us neutral, and then we get bullish if we start to"
"13186740","13187220"," trade higher."
"13188360","13190500"," And we never got out of getting neutral, right?"
"13191180","13192580"," On Thursday, we didn't get out of getting neutral."
"13193640","13195340"," So now we're heading back up right now. "
"13196040","13202500"," I'm watching lots of calls across the board, Tesla calls, February 18th, 895C for $874,000."
"13203160","13203900"," So let's just look."
"13204060","13206280"," I just posted this chart for you, okay?"
"13208860","13213340"," And you can see from last Thursday, I've got the skinny little line here. "
"13213480","13217160"," This is just a localized downward channel in this pie."
"13218040","13218860"," This isn't the big one."
"13218960","13219940"," This is the little one for three days. "
"13222170","13223970"," And you're looking at the numbers that I put there."
"13224230","13225650"," One, two, and three."
"13226180","13232130"," And so if you are super, super, super bearish on this market, you know, this changes every day. "
"13232450","13234670"," It's going to go up and the prices are going to change."
"13235890","13240530"," But generally speaking at number one, you're going to put in the money, put spread on, date it for"
"13240530","13243670"," like March 31st, make it 441, 442."
"13245590","13249330"," And then you're going to trade, let's say we keep trading higher, we don't roll over right here,"
"13249330","13250690"," right?"
"13250970","13254790"," So if we don't, if we start rolling over a bucket, you're making money on your put spreads. "
"13255650","13261250"," If we don't roll over and we start trading higher, you trade calls against it for a move higher."
"13262010","13269970"," You maintain your put spreads at 440 for this 420 or 390 we're going to hit, but you're making"
"13269970","13270350"," money."
"13271130","13273030"," This pays for your put spreads. "
"13273850","13275610"," You're not breaking even yet, right?"
"13275810","13278130"," You put spreads are losing money for the moment."
"13278490","13280650"," They do, they will get their money back if we trade lower."
"13281250","13284210"," In the meantime, you've traded calls all the way up to 450. "
"13286190","13289390"," And you've made money paid for your put spreads at this point, right?"
"13289610","13290670"," You're breaking even now."
"13291690","13294110"," And then it's a free ride from here in North, right?"
"13294350","13299750"," So if you, if you just trade and call, you're going to add more puts at the 450 level."
"13300150","13302450"," And then you're going to add more puts at the 460 level. "
"13303130","13307650"," And you're going to layer this all the way down until we trade back down to 420."
"13308410","13310690"," You can't tell me where we're going to roll over."
"13310790","13320010"," You can't tell me it's here at 440, 1 or 445 or 450, 440, so you layer your protection as"
"13320010","13320850"," we trade higher here. "
"13321350","13323370"," And let's say we never come back here."
"13323990","13325310"," We never come back here."
"13325510","13326710"," We, let's say we go to all-time new highs. "
"13327230","13329050"," You made money the entire way up."
"13329490","13331510"," You didn't get fucked on the entire way up."
"13331830","13336210"," You weren't just sitting like a stuck dumbass on puts all the way in here. "
"13336830","13340570"," And you're making money longing this market from right where we are."
"13340570","13347650"," Now, if we at any point start to roll over, you're going to stop buying calls and you already know"
"13347650","13355110"," you've got protection to downside and you would switch then to heavy puts or shorts on the market"
"13355110","13356570"," to trade it down to 420."
"13362190","13369010"," You guys understand where I'm coming from on this trade because this is the start of the last trade"
"13369010","13369510"," we had. "
"13369530","13371670"," This is exactly what Joe and I did."
"13373790","13374710"," We traded it up."
"13375530","13378430"," And then, of course, I had all the bulls asking me, you're still bearish. "
"13378670","13380290"," And I'm like, fuck yeah, I'm still bearish."
"13380910","13382110"," Matting puts at every level."
"13382290","13385730"," And if we trade down at any level, those puts will print each level. "
"13386050","13389350"," And if they don't print, you just hold on to them until they fucking do."
"13392240","13394280"," And we're kind of right there all over again, right?"
"13394400","13402890"," This looks like another reset of take the market long and protect yourself from the way back up"
"13402890","13403090"," again."
"13412810","13413810"," They're supposed to sit there. "
"13414730","13417570"," This is the exact same play as we traded the last time."
"13419390","13420130"," Nothing different."
"13444050","13445950"," There's really nothing different than where we have to be. "
"13445990","13447550"," This is the same trade as we traded."
"13449630","13451830"," We traded this back from January."
"13454610","13459150"," So back in January 20th, we did the exact same thing. "
"13474950","13478350"," I bet those VIX calls are just printing, right?"
"13478510","13481090"," UVXY calls, but they're fucking mad printing."
"13484920","13486300"," No, yeah, they're printing heavy."
"13515700","13518080"," Does this help you guys on how to trade right here?"
"13520580","13521480"," How to figure out how to do this?"
"13523140","13529520"," You can even, I mean, if you want to make it even, you don't have to get like a 441"
"13529520","13531300"," like in the money put spreads here. "
"13531440","13532660"," You can make them for 50s."
"13533060","13539140"," You're not going to make as much money as long as they, as long as they're low 450 on expiration,"
"13539720","13540140"," they're going to print."
"13543300","13548180"," Spy calls, February 14th, 441 C, $159,000. "
"13554540","13557320"," Yeah, I'll go on Twitter right now and accept."
"13559900","13561240"," It's at Captain's Alpha."
"13562500","13563600"," I'm not seeing any requests. "
"13568690","13571070"," If you did already request, I've accepted you."
"13572390","13573950"," Oh, just four, okay, you're right."
"13575670","13576450"," There you go, Liam. "
"13577990","13579650"," So I'll go over this once more, okay?"
"13580130","13582390"," So we made this trade at data 420."
"13583030","13585310"," It printed every step of the way it's printed."
"13586030","13589490"," At every level, you add on more and more, right?"
"13589810","13591750"," At every level, each level, you can see all three. "
"13591750","13593290"," They're labeled one, two, three."
"13594150","13598010"," You put, this is the same thing you do in a bull market."
"13598290","13600070"," So this is just the reverse of a bull market. "
"13600790","13607210"," When the last two years in 2020 and 2021, we would come to something like this, right?"
"13607390","13609550"," This would be a top, right?"
"13610850","13611410"," In the reverse."
"13613450","13615890"," Then you would do the same thing with calls though."
"13617270","13618330"," But now we're doing with puts. "
"13618750","13619610"," So we're just doing the reverse."
"13619890","13620510"," So we're down here."
"13621790","13623070"," Just slap some protection on. "
"13626670","13633030"," You know, you could trade, we could trade from today, you could put on 440 keys, 442s."
"13633410","13634590"," It doesn't matter if we trade to 460."
"13635310","13642330"," If as long as we trade back down to 442, we're gonna be good to go. "
"13646490","13648370"," Ukraine president, what do we got here?"
"13652420","13659460"," Ukraine president Zelensky says he wants peace, confidence, in its army, which is much stronger"
"13659460","13659940"," than 2014."
"13662120","13663340"," Looks like old news."
"13667700","13671280"," I don't know. "
"13671660","13676320"," I can't tell you, we're still in bear town."
"13676600","13678580"," Let's just be clear about this."
"13682060","13684720"," We have a major channel, right?"
"13684920","13688820"," We have a major downward channel going all the way back to, I think, first week of January. "
"13691500","13693800"," All the way back to January 4th."
"13696820","13698960"," And we haven't broke out of that channel."
"13699240","13701720"," Anything below that is still bearish, even if we trade higher. "
"13702940","13703960"," You're still bearish."
"13705280","13715160"," If we break over, that downward channel, you start to get neutral and you wait to see"
"13715160","13717780"," if it consolidates and trades higher."
"13718960","13722720"," If it starts to consolidate and then trades higher, you become bullish. "
"13723620","13728960"," If it consolidates and trades lower, you become bearish, which is what took place back on the 10th."
"13730280","13733820"," We consolidated sideways for one day, and then we started selling down."
"13735220","13736960"," Now we've hit support. "
"13738740","13739700"," Traded below it."
"13742100","13747640"," Down to the 43.5 level, but we didn't break through the 45.3 level."
"13747860","13757500"," If we had broken through the 43.5 level, we would have then had a price target below"
"13757500","13758040"," 420. "
"13761840","13771710"," Without that break below 45.30, we should trade higher here until once"
"13771710","13774790"," again, we hit some resistance levels, heading all way up to 450."
"13775710","13777850"," And possibly even, I don't think we'll get the 460."
"13779970","13782230"," But you have to trade what's in front of you at all times. "
"13784790","13790550"," So the spy just is now right now, currently at localized resistance."
"13791910","13796130"," This is resistance that formed three days ago on Thursday."
"13796750","13799630"," So right where we are right now here, we're touching. "
"13800630","13809650"," This resistance began on Thursday of last week to the pin actually."
"13810810","13815470"," It was actually an actual pin strike at 4, 4, 1, 6, 3."
"13819760","13828540"," If there's a breakup above this, if there's a breakup above 4, 4, 1, 6, 3, you should see short"
"13828540","13828880"," covering."
"13833900","13834500"," I can zoom up. "
"13835640","13845450"," The next round of sellers is at 4, 4, 2 "
"13845450","13849670",".74. If we break above there, you know that it's on, right?"
"13850650","13852890"," It'll be a squeeze to 4, 4, 500."
"13863020","13864060"," Good question."
"13864240","13869820"," Then let's use Burrell tweeting regarding the Iran nuclear talk saying that they would have another"
"13869820","13871820"," important call with the Iran Foreign Minister. "
"13872560","13875320"," He believes an agreement is within sight."
"13875880","13877320"," Got some use, Burrell."
"13877780","13880740"," All right, so I'm going to check Twitter real quick. "
"13887140","13889100"," I think I went back in and got you guys."
"13889260","13890060"," Oh, there's more, six more."
"13890880","13891580"," All right. "
"13892260","13894160"," So let's go over this once more, okay?"
"13894360","13897460"," We'll start at the beginning and we'll look at that chart."
"13898720","13901260"," This is the last post that I have on Twitter."
"13902860","13904620"," And we traded this the same way. "
"13907040","13910500"," Click on that chart, make it a full screen, so you guys have a look see."
"13913140","13918600"," And you'll see here, now there's another line in here that you should know about, which is 4, 4, 5,"
"13918860","13920840"," 0."
"13921280","13922000"," I didn't put this in here."
"13922060","13923420"," It's just above where I wrote the number one. "
"13926890","13931310"," But because we're at a bear market, it is kind of the opposite trade."
"13932530","13935290"," I used to at bottoms like this when we were in a bull market."
"13936190","13940310"," If we were down here, I would be buying right where we are right now. "
"13940510","13943690"," If we were in 2020, 2021, this is exactly what I would do."
"13944410","13945550"," We would hit this bottom."
"13946750","13951550"," If I am one to three month out, call spread in the money and they always fucking printed. "
"13953270","13962950"," And then if we traded to number two, I would be buying outside the money, call options, dated much"
"13962950","13963290"," closer."
"13964350","13971210"," If we traded to number three, I would be buying calls."
"13973590","13975290"," FDs, weeklies didn't matter. "
"13975410","13976570"," If we're heading towards number three, right?"
"13976950","13977950"," So we're in the reverse now."
"13978590","13983090"," We just did this same operation from late January."
"13984830","13988790"," So, and then this is where I catch all this shit because people are like, are you bullish?"
"13989010","13989510"," Are you bearish?"
"13989550","13989990"," Are you neutral?"
"13990190","13990810"," What are you right now?"
"13991530","13992830"," How can you say you're bearish?"
"13992830","13994130"," Well, you're taking longs. "
"13994570","13995850"," Big question I get right now."
"13995990","13996690"," All the fucking time."
"13996990","13997830"," Get bitched about it. "
"13998670","14002010"," Add fucking nauseam on Twitter and here."
"14003990","14006810"," So, what you would do here is you trade this north, right?"
"14006990","14010550"," You trade this with short dated calls, weeklies, dailies, aren't going to give a fuck what you're"
"14010550","14010850"," trading."
"14011370","14019390"," You, on resistance one here, you buy in the money, put spreads, or higher. "
"14019650","14020990"," You could make them for 50s."
"14020990","14024210"," You're not going to make as much money but you just buy them in the money."
"14025610","14028610"," Date them out a week or two past, the next OPEC's in March. "
"14028970","14033910"," There's some OPEC's in May that has some puts on them for 390, I think."
"14035150","14037150"," Well, in May you could buy some May if you wanted."
"14037410","14038130"," It's your risk level. "
"14039470","14043630"," But you bought these put spreads, they're in the money and you just start trading us north."
"14043890","14045790"," You trade bull from here."
"14048410","14051230"," And you're eventually paying for your puts spreads. "
"14051390","14052910"," It doesn't matter if they ever fucking print or not."
"14053430","14055850"," You just know they're there to protect you in case you get fucked."
"14057030","14063810"," You trade this north and then when you get to number two, right at 450, you're going to add some"
"14063810","14069130"," more fucking put spreads on right in the money and you're going to keep trading this north from"
"14069130","14069250"," there. "
"14069530","14071770"," I guess 445 would be a key strike to add some on."
"14072370","14075950"," And then 450 you add some more on and then 460 you add some more on."
"14077230","14079010"," And meanwhile, you're just making money all the way up. "
"14079490","14083210"," And then if we trade back down, you're going to end up cleaning up on the back end of that"
"14083210","14083410"," trade."
"14083770","14089910"," Now, if you don't, if you don't ever come back here, right, you're still going to make money from"
"14089910","14093570"," trading a bull from this point forward."
"14095450","14100130"," IWM calls February 18th, 207 C, 220,000 dollars. "
"14101890","14106150"," IWM February 18th, 207 C, 354,000 dollars."
"14107830","14109350"," IWM calls on small caps."
"14116160","14117420"," I'm going to tell you what though. "
"14118120","14124340"," If we fucking trade up today, right, I'm going to start fucking ban hammering again."
"14132180","14133880"," Now, I don't see any sneaky."
"14133880","14142240"," The only sneaky P that I see right now, not a suit is I don't like, like there's a lot"
"14142240","14146760"," more spy calls February 14th, 441 C, 164,000 dollars. "
"14146760","14152320"," The only thing that I don't like right now is I don't like where some tickers are."
"14152700","14155420"," Like, I don't like where Tesla is."
"14155680","14157740"," I don't like where Amazon is. "
"14159900","14161600"," I don't like where Apple is."
"14162980","14166280"," I mean, Facebook's just a fucking redheaded stepchild."
"14168580","14173540"," I think the key is though, like Netflix is rolling over slightly. "
"14176420","14182300"," So if you're looking, if you're taking it all as a whole, it looks fucking bearish, right?"
"14182640","14184320"," It looks like we're going to roll over right here."
"14187340","14191020"," So my only point on this is you put the protection on."
"14191280","14193320"," You don't have to actually be in a long at this moment. "
"14194440","14196280"," But you put some protection on where we are."
"14196340","14197180"," We put on some put spreads."
"14198340","14204560"," And if we break above this three day, if we break above this three day channel, this downward"
"14204560","14211120"," sloping channel for three days, if we break above it, take a long and hold on to your put spreads. "
"14216130","14220910"," But the way you don't want to do is be like, oh, I'm buying zero-day puts right here."
"14221550","14223570"," And then we trade higher because you're going to get fucked."
"14224970","14227410"," Even if everything looks bearish, because it does look bearish. "
"14227410","14230410"," I'm looking at it right now on a day on an intraday char right now."
"14230670","14233330"," It looks bearish, but you know, I'm ready."
"14234130","14238230"," IWM calls February 18th, 207C, $220,000. "
"14238230","14242190"," IWM calls February 18th, 207C, $354,000."
"14242190","14246530"," Spy calls February 14th, 441C, $164,000."

"14253310","14257070"," Spy calls February 14th, 441C, $154,000."
"14257770","14260570"," So I'm assuming that somebody knows them some more than we do. "
"14261390","14266010"," I'm assuming there's a bank or a hedge fund that thinks, oh, I'm going to fucking squeeze these"
"14266010","14266330"," shorts."
"14267410","14272210"," You know, and I'm assuming that hedge funds don't want to buy short here."
"14272350","14276370"," Now this could be all wrong, you know, but I don't say to you. "
"14276490","14280170"," My assumption is that we trade higher here."
"14281130","14286030"," And my assumption is that you put on put spread protection here."
"14286550","14292190"," And if we do roll over it, that's when you buy naked puts or not naked puts, because those are"
"14292190","14293690"," calls, excuse me. "
"14294090","14295770"," I mean, there's so such thing as naked puts."
"14296010","14296270"," Is there?"
"14299280","14309200"," You just buy calls and those naked calls, which is the opposite of"
"14309200","14309620"," the fair trade."
"14309840","14318690"," But there's mixed signals in the market right now where we are currently. "
"14319930","14324430"," If you just ask me, just looking at a channel starting, I was like, are we going higher or going"
"14324430","14324610"," lower?"
"14324830","14325610"," I'm going fucking lower."
"14330530","14334510"," But if you look at the book map, we've got a positive hero indicator."
"14335250","14339610"," We've got rotation into spy currently, whether you like it or not. "
"14340210","14340870"," That's what's happening."
"14347500","14352520"," And if you were a bear back in January and we hit 420, you got fucked."
"14353460","14355840"," Unless you were protecting yourself all the way up to 460. "
"14358100","14361780"," Remember that fucking run was what 400 fucking points, right?"
"14362880","14365760"," So bears got their fucking shit pushed in."
"14367480","14369420"," So I don't want to fucking hear we're selling off today."
"14370400","14373020"," We could sell off today, but I don't want to fucking hear the bull shit. "
"14376400","14387540"," There's bad as fucking bulls, because that"
"14387540","14388940"," what a naked put is just buying puts."
"14393890","14395170"," You guys get my point, right?"
"14395450","14397010"," Well, you guys at least get my point, right?"
"14397170","14402190"," If the market goes down and it goes up and it goes up and it goes down, it seems like"
"14402190","14405890"," it goes down a lot more than it goes up right now in the grand scheme of things."
"14406410","14410510"," But even if you're bearish, you have to give a breather to the market. "

"14428480","14429920"," AD counterpart is taking one point."
"14430060","14433780"," Yeah, I'm going to do my own fucking hammering at this point, because I don't want to hear nonsense"
"14433780","14435640"," from fuckheads that show up in the morning."
"14436460","14441240"," I'm trying to tell me we're fucking burning at fucking 9am, because we haven't burned yet. "
"14442200","14447500"," And it's unwise as a trader to take that fucking trade."
"14447900","14457750"," The way that you take that trade is wrong, unless some news comes in that we don't"
"14457750","14458190"," know about."
"14459610","14466450"," The New York Fed takes 1.6 trillion, trillion, in our P program. "
"14469870","14472070"," Now that should impact the TLT and the shy."
"14472810","14475870"," So we'll take a look at the shy real quick."
"14482050","14483270"," That's the twos, baby. "
"14484950","14486890"," Twos in 20s, right?"
"14487030","14488590"," It's like the old school DJ stuff, right?"
"14489150","14491990"," Released to call the techniques, the one twos."
"14492850","14495530"," Every time I see here, twos in 20s, I think one twos."
"14497190","14498750"," TLT, we'll see what TLT's doing. "
"14500330","14501110"," TLT's got a bid."
"14502730","14504670"," The shy's got a bid, the one, the three-year note."
"14505870","14518220"," I know, but we'll see"
"14518220","14518800"," what happens here. "
"14543960","14550240"," Now, if you do see a roll over here, we'll enter some puts."
"14554380","14555980"," Yeah, the ones and twos, right?"
"14556600","14557200"," That's what it's called."
"14577820","14579160"," We'll see if we can make a move higher. "
"14584620","14586100"," Let's see in much news today."
"14587380","14589040"," Let's look at the economic calendar."
"14589480","14592680"," I know we've got some nasty economic calendar news. "
"14592680","14596500"," One point of note on the economic calendar."
"14596920","14604550"," Last week's hot CPI report."
"14605090","14606150"," It wasn't that hot. "
"14607570","14611090"," So I don't like the idea of the PPI."
"14613490","14622230"," Tomorrow we've got the PPI numbers coming out at 8.30. And let me know in the chat because I'm"
"14622230","14625070"," feeling like an awkward penguin with that number."
"14627190","14632630"," So the forecast on CPI"
"14634710","14642030"," last week, it wasn't that hot. "
"14643330","14644830"," And they used it to sell the market."
"14646550","14650110"," So I am concerned with runway heading into the close."
"14652990","14662990"," And I'm also concerned with the previous PPI was 0.2%. Tomorrow's forecast is 0.5%. So let's say it"
"14662990","14672930"," comes in a 0.6%. Is that a fucking sell down to 4,000 or something?"
"14675070","14679790"," Or if it comes in line at 0.5%, is that considered hot?"
"14681310","14683850"," And then Wednesday we've got retail sales. "
"14689780","14691320"," I don't see anything."
"14691760","14700280"," We do have the FOMC minutes on Wednesday the 16th, at 2.30 PM."
"14703320","14708120"," And then we've got claims and initial and continuing claims on Thursday. "
"14709500","14717260"," There's some other stuff in there, but what else do I see?"
"14718600","14720460"," Existing home sales is interesting."
"14723100","14726940"," Where it didn't matter before, it doesn't matter now if home sales have gone down."
"14729160","14732480"," Look at the 18, we also have OPEC's on the 18th as well. "
"14735800","14737720"," I'm going to Fed Speaker on Friday."
"14739120","14741940"," We've got a Fed Speaker on Thursday too, Bullard."
"14743800","14746880"," And a Master, she's a dove, I think. "
"14749000","14753760"," I forget, I can't remember if he's a bull or if he's a dove-ish or not."
"14755100","14756580"," You have to look that shit up."
"14759320","14761100"," I'm looking to see what else we've got. "
"14761420","14762820"," Thursday the 24th, got GDP."
"14767380","14769820"," Real consumer spending on the 25th."
"14770240","14773100"," It just gets fucking nasty as you keep going on and on and on. "
"14781130","14787090"," Let's look at the, looks like some put buyers are stepping in here."
"14787230","14788170"," You see that right back here?"
"14789290","14790970"," Some put buyers stepping in now."
"14798430","14812870"," Let me"
"14812870","14813950"," see what you guys are saying here. "
"14820320","14821460"," Let me scroll back up a little bit."
"14824260","14832160"," Biden, Braden's Johnson, speak Monday around 12.30. The White House YouTube has stuff at 2.30. Give"
"14832160","14832860"," me a pimp."
"14833040","14833940"," The world is so fucked. "
"14835400","14836980"," I'm missing so many of you guys."
"14837260","14840480"," If I'm buying a fair flag in SE, I think we've read all this stuff already."
"14843620","14849200"," Anyhow, 40 C's into the close, but Tesla on a dip, thinking about the sound a bit later, what about"
"14849200","14850120"," the original Fed meeting. "
"14850120","14852220"," There was no emergency Fed meeting."
"14854240","14855860"," Yeah, Biden, Johnson, call."
"14856220","14858020"," I don't know what the fuck might happen with that. "
"14861080","14862520"," Roblox, Yalaka, Roblox."
"14863240","14865580"," Seaving, competing bids for second Gigafactory."
"14867200","14872200"," What's the C.O.B. The previous saw has been a good job to explain that for them. "
"14874140","14875560"," Where are all those?"
"14881370","14881910"," Perfalia."
"14884750","14889510"," I think these are me and Twitter."
"14897030","14897890"," Hammer time. "
"14902590","14904090"," Yeah, I'm angry about my glasses."

"14919520","14919800"," We'll see. "
"14920680","14922060"," How did everything just dump?"
"14923180","14923900"," We'll be right-handed."
"14924180","14925400"," Can we take a gander a chop?"
"14926620","14927260"," Yalaka chop."
"14929100","14930160"," Can we just sell off?"
"14931180","14932920"," Yeah, watching some spy calls. "
"14933540","14936220"," 214, 445 C for $97,000."
"14936900","14941520"," And then some Facebook puts February 18th, 210 P for $256,000."
"14941890","14950800"," Spy puts, 214, 440 P, $82,000 in QQQ puts February 14th, $55,000. "
"14966570","14967060"," Okay."
"14971050","14972220"," Let me look at the shop."

"15008260","15012760"," Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey, and a good only if it's in line with other news."
"15024740","15026180"," Yeah, it's been similar."
"15026480","15032720"," It's been the RPPT, or RRP is at, what was the change?"
"15036870","15043360"," It's 0.05%. Let's see if I can get. "

"15146960","15150000"," Website is a New York Fed.org or Data Hub."
"15161340","15162540"," Take a look at Shopify."
"15163700","15165020"," More spy calls. "

"15190500","15191960"," I like it to 875."
"15194200","15195800"," It's got more sellers than buyers. "
"15198960","15200320"," Put the hair indicator on it."
"15200320","15205280"," I see where real support is."
"15206040","15206880"," Down at 830. "

"15214640","15215160"," Down here."
"15217040","15217580"," Buyers at 830."
"15217800","15218580"," Sellers at 875. "
"15229440","15230940"," We'll look lower for some more support."
"15232320","15233480"," Real support's at 800."
"15237520","15241580"," For a large support, four times the number of buyers at 800 than an 830. "
"15247520","15248240"," Send the alert."

"15256690","15259470"," Send the alert for 830 and then set a real alert for 800. "
"15260390","15260830"," Shopify."
"15271140","15273060"," So what do you guys think we do into the bell?"
"15273800","15274660"," I'll do my next question."
"15275740","15277260"," Do you guys think we sell off?"
"15278000","15282220"," Or do you guys think that we trade higher if shorts come off into the bell?"
"15283380","15296700"," Do you remember"
"15296700","15299380"," earnings play some interest in 880 week, please?"
"15306980","15308700"," Your rumor is asking what?"
"15309040","15310600"," I missed what you were asking, your rumor. "
"15313680","15317000"," I'm thinking you dumb supply to 435 so I can calmly long it."
"15317180","15317800"," Yeah, no shit."
"15329330","15331670"," Lots of burning today of options. "
"15334070","15339130"," I wouldn't, if we, if we trade below 435, I wouldn't be long in it without a doubt."
"15343150","15348050"," If we trade below 4350, take the spy down to 420."
"15349170","15356910"," Watching more spy puts come in February 14th, 439P, 224 or $24,000. "
"15361710","15366670"," Also, QQQ's February 14th, 347P, 165,000."
"15367450","15373860"," You should see some weakness and a close, just depending upon that economic calendar for tomorrow."
"15374920","15384660"," The PPI, if it comes in at 0.5%, just based on"
"15384660","15390120"," what happened with CPI numbers, it would be considered hot, right?"
"15390380","15390700"," I don't know. "
"15391000","15392000"," It would be considered hot."
"15396210","15401310"," We shouldn't have had such a steep sell off on the CPI numbers, and we did."
"15402130","15405950"," So maybe the market's just looking for excuses to sell. "
"15423100","15441120"," It puts on TXN February 18th, 162.5, but"
"15441120","15450460"," you'll see that we traded up to 441.32 at 10am, traded up again to"
"15450460","15456080"," 441.55 at 1pm."
"15456080","15466080"," It's now 1.30. We traded back down to 438.89. If the bulls can't put it together between"
"15466080","15475600"," now and 4pm, just the volatility alone into tomorrow could set up for a"
"15475600","15477980"," nice negative trade."
"15502620","15505120"," Let's take a look at that chain and see where everybody is. "
"15512090","15517370"," You got a lot of puts on 438P, you got 128,000 contracts."
"15519170","15521350"," They're at $1.05 or something like that."
"15524290","15529930"," Then for the 16th, there's a lot of interest in 435P. "
"15529930","15539750"," There's 38,000 contracts for $2.78. And then"
"15539750","15548730"," for the 18th, there's $4.35P. $4, there's 40,000 of those out there."
"15552470","15554410"," And let's see what else we got."
"15560870","15568090"," I'd have to go back and see where all the interest was on. "
"15569990","15571510"," Let me now look at it right now."
"15572430","15584580"," Let's go look and see where all"
"15584580","15585900"," the interest is for Friday."
"15600090","15605930"," And that's where it's like Friday, Max Payne is somewhere around 452. "
"15613300","15616820"," And there's a concentration, this is exactly where they were."
"15616820","15623740"," There's a concentration of puts on Friday for OPEX at 424."
"15625600","15631480"," That's where all the puts are, 424 for this Friday for this Friday's OPEX. "
"15635300","15638400"," Let's look at today's and Wednesday's."
"15645320","15648600"," Wednesday, there's a huge concentration on 371."
"15651120","15659600"," I'm betting that all these puts on 371, these were all, this is from back in January during the,"
"15659940","15664440"," um, it was back in January when we were down at 420. "
"15666580","15672020"," There's another concentration at 390 for Wednesday."
"15673560","15682020"," There's another concentration for 420 for Wednesday expiry and down to 437."
"15683180","15691860"," So on Wednesday expiry, there's a huge concentration of puts for between 420 and 435. "

"20416530","20421750"," I was watching, I had a news, I had a news feed running all weekend, I was looking at our"
"20421750","20422790"," rotors news feed."
"20425330","20430250"," And it was on the hour, on the hour, same shit."
"20434210","20439690"," On the hour, every hour, there was a story of the same story over and over both Ukraine's"
"20439690","20445330"," aspirations to join NATO are not a matter for the US or any other country to decide. "
"20451120","20457340"," Ukraine, Ukraine government adviser President Zelensky was being ironic when he said he'd been told"
"20457340","20460180"," Russian attack would begin February 16th."
"20470000","20476800"," Still have a large cell wall above it that 896, 150,000, 140,000 sellers."
"20479240","20482500"," Same story by the seller rip. "
"20505490","20508550"," That's on whale scooping up those 311, 195's on an apple."
"20511030","20517470"," Tough as the next year, watch them do a more more thing at the end of the presser, meaning"
"20517470","20517890"," literally."
"20525940","20529240"," Yeah, so Tesla is basically still by the dip seller rip. "
"20530640","20536340"," There are more buyers showing up a little bit higher than that 750 number, but it does look like a"
"20536340","20536640"," envelope."
"20553540","20556140"," Yeah, there's a mass manipulation in the market right now."
"20556680","20557560"," I'm sorry, there is. "
"20559020","20560280"," The whole thing is fucking goofy."
"20562020","20564100"," Oh, the Ukraine president is a former community comedian?"
"20564440","20565020"," Are you shitting me?"
"20573790","20575830"," Yeah, watch them do one more thing at the end of the presser."
"20576790","20578070"," It's kind of fucking stupid. "
"20579030","20581950"," No, what I think they do is they think they're going to try to pin this into the close."
"20582290","20587670"," Look between like 441, 28, 439, 95."
"20590370","20591970"," We could trade higher into the bell. "
"20592590","20595530"," I know that there were some spreads that needed to be."
"20595730","20598890"," I know there's some spreads that needed to print earlier down at 435."
"20600190","20602050"," It looks like those printed. "
"20602710","20604810"," There's a shit ton of put still on now."
"20605130","20606590"," There were 45,000 contracts."
"20606910","20611190"," Now there's almost 200, 223,000 contracts down there. "
"20611710","20614010"," The price of those puts are now down to 45 cents."
"20614190","20621790"," $29.5% prior."
"20626010","20631130"," So they've got the market pinned, which is good for from one hour now, one hour to do cash equity"
"20631130","20631470"," close. "
"20633250","20639770"," US 10 year yield at 199 here as we get out of titrating for US fixed income markets, two year"
"20639770","20641930"," at 1.5, a 7%."
"20646970","20655750"," For Wednesday expiry, we've got February 16th, 435 P, 70,000 contracts."
"20658170","20663290"," We do, I do want you guys to see, I've got some cues come out, right?"
"20663530","20664290"," People are asking what happens. "
"20664570","20671180"," But I want you guys to understand that tomorrow for the economic calendar, we have volatility."
"20675110","20676350"," There's no other way to say it."
"20677450","20679190"," So that's 3 p.m. I'm going to have a bourbon. "
"20680970","20682350"," That was some wild ass trading."
"20685310","20688330"," That was definitely not any kind of skill in that."
"20688490","20693950"," That was just the min and the amount only because of the, I knew that there would be a hedge"
"20693950","20695830"," on that million dollar put. "
"20696690","20697650"," But it's usually quick."
"20697810","20702590"," It's usually like a few minutes, like two, three minutes to get a little dip down over that, over"
"20702590","20703010"," that put."
"20704330","20707870"," So tomorrow, right, we've got the producer price index. "
"20708450","20709490"," That shit's no fucking around."
"20709730","20714510"," Like that's part of our inflation, right?"
"20717220","20718520"," It's part of our inflation numbers."
"20718900","20719800"," It's not going to be pretty. "
"20721020","20729440"," My question about it is what I didn't like was that we sold off on CPI numbers that were hot,"
"20729620","20732260"," but not out of the realm of expected."
"20734100","20736460"," We were expecting close to those numbers."
"20737220","20741220"," I would have liked to have seen the CPI number be a lot hotter for the sell off that we"
"20741220","20741660"," incurred. "
"20743540","20747620"," So it was just used as an excuse in my view, no matter what anybody's saying."
"20747840","20750420"," I know everybody out there's like, oh, it was a hot CPI print."
"20751080","20755480"," And in my view was not as hot as what we were expecting and what came in. "
"20755860","20760640"," I wanted to see it hotter for us to sell down like we have sold down."
"20761680","20767740"," And even Bullard coming out was a little fucking obnoxious for that CPI print because then the"
"20767740","20770400"," question is, what if the CPI print had come in even hotter?"
"20771820","20775960"," I mean, would he have like lit himself on fire with some gasoline in the street or something?"
"20776700","20781940"," So I'm still scratching my head over the reaction to the CPI print."
"20782260","20787020"," But that does lead us into Tuesday's PPI, which should come in hot. "
"20787780","20788760"," Nothing for nothing."
"20788960","20789720"," It should come in hot."
"20789980","20793720"," So the expectation, and then we've got retail sales on Wednesday. "
"20794740","20796420"," We've got import price index."
"20796900","20805900"," Now we know that some import price index, a lot of other countries were going to or run with"
"20805900","20814410"," with their own currencies being devalued."
"20814550","20817630"," But we've seen a lot of countries saying, nope, we're going to flip the script and we're going to"
"20817630","20821170"," start QT and we're going to start raising rates. "
"20822090","20826210"," So when their price has become competitive or when their dollars become competitive with our"
"20826210","20829350"," dollars, it doesn't help us on our inflation side."
"20829530","20835390"," We need cheap, cheap dollars in other countries so we could import goods that are cheap for our"
"20835390","20835950"," people."
"20836190","20839750"," And that helps our inflation go down when the dollar is stronger. "
"20840530","20844030"," So I don't know that those numbers are going to come in too good for us either."
"20844430","20849830"," Although this is last month's stuff, but the killer for Wednesday is so today's Monday, right?"
"20849930","20852450"," On Wednesday, we've got FOMC meeting minutes."
"20853290","20859550"," And regardless of whether we're setting those FOMC minutes, you fucking know that people are going"
"20859550","20861770"," to use that as a negative catalyst. "
"20862310","20863570"," I don't care what you say."
"20864150","20870070"," They're going to say that they're probably talking about 10 rate increases for 100 BPS by March."
"20870490","20871350"," That's what they're going to tell you. "
"20871570","20872290"," Something insane."
"20872990","20877630"," And it's not going to matter what you think the FOMC minutes are."
"20877750","20884210"," What matters is that the market will probably trade sideways and down over the PPI numbers on"
"20884210","20885270"," Tuesday and Wednesday. "
"20885770","20890690"," And then let's say Wednesday, we rip higher after the minutes or Thursday, we rip higher."
"20891750","20898310"," And then we come back into some into wherever the fuck they want it for Wednesday for the Wednesday"
"20898310","20899290"," spreads."
"20899750","20902950"," And let's look at the Wednesday spreads again real quick because they forgot what they were. "
"20909030","20910090"," Where's all the concentration?"
"20910530","20911410"," Oh, excuse me, Friday spreads."
"20911690","20913850"," I mean, like where do they want it on Friday?"
"20918230","20925440"," And they got a big old, I mean, last update."
"20926380","20927520"," Let's see if I get this here. "
"20927920","20928480"," I got this right."
"20928620","20928840"," Hold on."
"20931120","20939560"," So unless nothing changes, which we know stuff changes here, we've got on Friday, we've got a huge. "
"20940600","20942320"," Come on here."
"20945280","20949480"," We've got a huge strike out there on Friday for 425."
"20949480","20953480"," I don't think we get down to 425, but it's possible. "
"20953780","20955940"," It's on the table without a doubt, right?"
"20956720","20959800"," They're going to want to print those at some point between now and Friday."
"20960020","20964680"," Maybe they print them by Wednesday and then we come up another one or two percent or something on"
"20964680","20965400"," third on Friday."
"20967180","20973860"," But there is still, I remember there were articles saying that, you know, you're being fed out"
"20973860","20974920"," there on media. "
"20976560","20978340"," That only retail has puts."
"20979180","20981660"," But the reality is, it's not retail."
"20982060","20982400"," It's banks. "
"20982720","20984740"," They have puts for 425 on Friday."
"20989250","20991430"," There's a, there's a huge, there's a whole bunch of them."
"20992150","20997430"," 123,000 contracts for Friday for 425 P."
"21000490","21003090"," These have been on for a long time too. "
"21003350","21005350"," These didn't just come out like two days ago."
"21028400","21030860"," It was a comedian before it was an office, huh?"
"21032960","21034240"," Yeah, boy caught the stock market."
"21034700","21036980"," Yeah, I agree, Gerald, the PPI will be bad. "
"21041770","21042210"," Nice."
"21042870","21047090"," Not confirming that we're burning files in the embassy just said we didn't have to burn passports."
"21048250","21049710"," We destroyed everything else. "
"21062790","21064750"," It does look like they'll park it into the clothes."
"21071210","21077170"," But I mean, if you wanted to take the bear stance into tomorrow or if I'm going to take another,"
"21077490","21081430"," if I'm going to take any more puts, I'm going to wait to see if we trade up into the"
"21081430","21081650"," bell."
"21082270","21084430"," Hopefully we can get it up to, I think it greedy. "
"21084650","21086670"," We can get up to 440 or 441."
"21087650","21091970"," And if we can between now and 4 p.m, I'll grab some more puts."
"21111670","21112570"," Yeah, press conferences over. "
"21112570","21118210"," But you'll surely get some volatility on."
"21118330","21122730"," Let's see where we're at on particular the VIX and see where it's at."
"21128180","21130060"," The VIX is trading slightly lower. "
"21134240","21134760"," 2962."
"21154400","21154860"," Mm."
"21159580","21165720"," Man, I'll tell you what, for where it's at right now, tough place to be short here. "
"21168120","21170280"," It really is a tough place to be short here."
"21181870","21185870"," You're looking to see, you really want to see the VIX up at what?"
"21186710","21189010"," Tell me we're going to print the VIX to $41."
"21192650","21196770"," How many of you out there think we can print the VIX to $41?"
"21199550","21208900"," I guess you could print it to $41 by March"
"21208900","21210120"," 28th. "
"21211420","21211980"," $42."
"21228570","21230530"," Or could you print it there by OPEX?"
"21231170","21232950"," That's such a huge move."
"21268830","21276730"," I think you can get VIX to, it looks like you can get the VIX by Friday up to maybe"
"21286110","21286770"," $41. "
"21291650","21294170"," Let's see what's in the options chain in the VIX."
"21305190","21310610"," There's a concentration of calls in the VIX for 40 bucks."
"21311890","21321480"," A bunch of VIX calls, $21,000 for Friday, so for Wednesday,"
"21330410","21334210"," 35C for Friday, there's 2,000, but not a ton more. "
"21336370","21339790"," There's only 2,000 contracts for Friday to 35C."
"21341050","21345970"," Nobody's sitting on 40C, so no one's expecting that move."
"21374150","21383990"," The VIX is still selling off right now,"
"21386290","21398010"," so wait and see if we can trade higher on spy"
"21400030","21402530"," into the bell and then we'll get some more protection. "
"21414140","21423020"," Still buy program on, still positive here in Decatur, even with that sell-off."
"21440110","21451970"," Let's see, because yeah, 41"
"21451970","21453590"," VIX by March doesn't seem unreasonable."
"21461250","21470710"," Tesla 950C for Friday will alert, but if Russia actually invades the sell-off, it's not a sell-the "
"21470710","21472190","-news event, it never has been. "
"21473270","21479250"," All wars are not, every time we've had issues like that, there's not a sell-the-news event we sell"
"21479250","21479570"," down."
"21480630","21487090"," Change the waiting calculations based on, yeah, in fact, House Putin could invade with little to no"
"21487090","21487710"," warning headline."
"21488530","21492130"," He's saying, Josh, House Putin could evade with little to no warning headline right now, with most"
"21492130","21494910"," of those shit, gonna tell us some weeks and months ahead, I agree. "
"21495810","21499250"," I couldn't lose hearing loss as an Aztec back to flat on the day."
"21499450","21500590"," Yeah, White House pressure is over."
"21500870","21533340"," That's a 2.5%. Oh, because it's all BS, yeah, it's"
"21533340","21533340"," all BS. "
"21534100","21536720"," Uh, the hair in the care has been green all day long."
"21539360","21547280"," Other than the scam fucking pumping dump jobs that are coming into the market right now, trade up"
"21547280","21551240"," fucking scam pumping junk dump jobs, the call buying is very well."
"21551340","21557400"," This is really weird too because the, the call ratio is neutral at best. "
"21559780","21563880"," It's at 72% bullish."
"21565340","21568960"," It is 0.566 right now."
"21569780","21574820"," So you put fully get 172,000 puts to 30,000 and 5,000 calls. "
"21576000","21580020"," And let's look at, let's look"
"21580020","21589240"," at the and see what we can see here."
"21591760","21599820"," I mean, regardless of this sell off, this is accumulation, right?"
"21600300","21604440"," No, this is in call buying all day long on the market."
"21605140","21617860"," You can't be denied even with that sell off, which is"
"21617860","21618140"," wild. "
"21627040","21629640"," It's still a positive hair indicator on the market."
"21642480","21644300"," The volume on the news guy is low."
"21644960","21645620"," Let me see, take a look. "
"21647020","21647680"," Pick one too."
"21649200","21650720"," See if that helps out there."
"21651040","21652480"," Let me know if that's, if it's higher. "
"21665340","21670860"," You're gonna give it a 1% chance that Biden or that Putin is full blown invades are paying the"
"21670860","21671480"," war breaks out."
"21672500","21673500"," I don't know."
"21677900","21679680"," I see why he wants to. "
"21680100","21685540"," I see intense behind."
"21685760","21686520"," I'm gonna have a, I'm gonna have a."
"21687180","21688120"," Cheers to all of you out there."
"21696900","21706880"," I think Putin has"
"21706880","21708060"," good reason to invade. "
"21709860","21712400"," Unless they're going to move Moscow, the capital somewhere else."
"21715140","21717360"," I understand the reasoning behind it."
"21719680","21721040"," There's a bunch of different reasons. "
"21724600","21730980"," It's not just that reason that was close to his capital, but there's a fair point to be made."
"21732120","21740500"," You know, if Russia, if Russia and China parked a bunch of shit next door and like coupe back or"
"21740500","21747330"," something, the US would be like, oh, fuck, no, they ain't happening."
"21751860","21753980"," We know it's criminal organization. "
"21754220","21757480"," We know that it'll, it'll do well with nationalists, right?"
"21758460","21760360"," Just like American nationalists, right?"
"21760540","21761760"," People that are like, hey, I'm pro-America."
"21763900","21767900"," So it'll be good for his presidency."
"21769660","21775200"," We also know that Ukraine's got some good, they've got ports, right?"
"21775380","21775880"," Ocean access. "
"21777100","21782340"," Geoplytically, the reason why the United States own or runs shit is because we have access to the"
"21782340","21782860"," world's oceans."
"21783220","21786900"," We have lots of land or land on the ocean as well."
"21788260","21794220"," And to be honest, one of the things that limits China and Russia is their access to the world's"
"21794220","21795180"," oceans is small. "
"21796160","21797320"," It's what makes us powerful."
"21797940","21803000"," It's why China is influence, well, part of the reason why China is influencing so heavily and"
"21803000","21805460"," Africa is to have access to the world's oceans."
"21808170","21816570"," The iron curtain, when it was up, whether you liked it or not, lent stability across the world,"
"21816710","21817270"," believe it or not. "
"21817450","21822770"," There was a lot of stability when the Russia and the United States had their Cold War."
"21825180","21826980"," That includes the Middle East, that includes everywhere."
"21827800","21830380"," They ruled with an iron fist, there was buffers everywhere. "
"21830960","21832360"," No, that doesn't mean that it should be like that."
"21834380","21836880"," So, will there be a war with Ukraine?"
"21837840","21839700"," I'm going to give it more than likely, yes."
"21841460","21843540"," I'll give it like a 70% chance of happening. "
"21845760","21847740"," Will it impact our stock market when it happens?"
"21848040","21848340"," Absolutely."
"21849860","21850940"," Every event like that has."
"21854510","21860490"," It's not like that it's being used right now, popping up our stock market the way that it is. "
"21866850","21869130"," Dumb 60 fucking handles on lies, right?"
"21869530","21870150"," That's what we just did."
"21870150","21871450"," We dumped 60 handles on lies."
"21886070","21887310"," Ukraine makes a ton of wheat. "
"21888450","21888930"," Absolutely."
"21901840","21905660"," My read on the CPI was that it was used as a fucking way to dump the market."
"21905860","21906120"," That's it. "
"21908110","21908970"," It's that simple."
"21914490","21923370"," Yeah, Belton Road initiative or CCP is doing that, but the Belton Road initiative by China in"
"21923370","21924650"," Africa is fucking monsters."
"21927950","21929050"," What are you guys talking about?"
"21930450","21931750"," I didn't see what you said, Winky. "
"21937120","21938700"," I see why he wants to invade."
"21939140","21940280"," I'm going to get the logic behind it."
"21940920","21957360"," Do I agree with"
"21957360","21957500"," it?"
"21957800","21958160"," Fuck no. "
"21960020","21965280"," I'm a Democrat, just so you all know out there, but I am an old school kind of Democrat."
"21970540","21972360"," I think like Lyndon Johnson."
"21975300","21981740"," You know, I believe in human rights and I believe in the ideals that are countries, that's fourth. "
"21982620","21983640"," And I'll fight for it."
"21983680","21984640"," I fought for it for my country."
"21987740","21992770"," But I think you should own me again. "
"21993370","21994590"," And I don't care what to do with your body."
"21997290","21998890"," I don't care what your religion is."
"21998990","21999990"," I don't care what tell you are. "
"22006080","22007160"," I believe in immigration."
"22010040","22010640"," All that kind of stuff."
"22011140","22012100"," Like an old school Democrat, I guess. "
"22012100","22013220"," I don't know if that's what you'd call it."
"22015240","22017260"," And nothing's black and white when it comes to politics."
"22018320","22019680"," But our country makes it glaring. "
"22023920","22031490"," But for me, I don't want to see China and Russia get power."
"22032030","22034710"," You don't want to see Russia and China get power."
"22035550","22037570"," And trust me, I don't. "
"22040350","22044970"," When I hear people say that they don't mind it, we got the spies ripping higher into clothes here."
"22046390","22048210"," Spies looking for that 443 again."
"22053490","22057250"," Whenever I hear some people speak naively, I think that they haven't traveled the world. "
"22058850","22068820"," I think the moment that you travel around the world, you get a real idea of how there are"
"22068820","22070180"," some, not all the rest of the world, you know."
"22070520","22076260"," There's some really nice places to live, but a lot of other people live is not how you live here"
"22076260","22077040"," in the United States."
"22077740","22087690"," It calls on silver, February, or excuse me, July 15th, 20.5, $221,000 high"
"22087690","22088270"," agro score. "
"22096290","22097390"," Fixed is dying."
"22106400","22107600"," All catching bids."
"22114330","22115310"," Let's look at the mix. "
"22119250","22129270"," You have fixed now down to 29.23. Localized support down at 28.48. Or"
"22129270","22131410"," we can also call it the alarm."
"22138620","22140520"," It's kind of sitting on support right now."
"22141340","22141560"," Fixed. "
"22143100","22146740"," At least since February 11th at 1 in the afternoon."
"22148200","22149480"," We'll see what happens here."
"22149960","22150600"," They can dump through. "
"22161190","22166010"," Yeah, so I've bought every flow service out there."
"22166150","22166730"," I bought them all."
"22166830","22171150"," I bought trade ticks, unusual whales, you name it. "
"22171990","22172970"," I've paid for it."
"22173250","22177490"," I've paid for, let's see the other one."
"22178290","22178810"," Bar charts. "
"22180570","22182210"," I've paid for most of them out there."
"22182850","22187310"," Probably at least eight to ten different flow softwares."
"22187930","22192070"," And you'll get anecdotal evidence from people. "
"22192290","22194750"," They'll tell you things like, oh, well, trade ticks says this."
"22195090","22196810"," Or in usual, whales says that."
"22198030","22201950"," But I've never seen, like it's always anted, antedotal. "
"22203510","22210650"," I've never made more money with more concentrated, directed information than I have with flow algo."
"22211550","22216290"," So when I when I when I peel through and dig through all these other flow sites."
"22218090","22224690"," It's too much information to find an executionable, like an executable trade. "
"22226830","22230350"," So I'm now looking to, if I if I wanted to dig through trading ticks."
"22232710","22236910"," I guess you could if you wanted to dig through trade, trade ticks, but you can get trade, take shit"
"22236910","22237830"," free everywhere else."
"22238810","22241470"," I'm kind of, I don't want, but you can get bogged down in information. "
"22241810","22245310"," So I'm just looking to go to the flow and say, what is the flow saying?"
"22247350","22248930"," And get a market direction."
"22250730","22252190"," Or get some golden tickets."
"22252990","22254510"," I don't have to have every single trade. "
"22255790","22257150"," What's what's flying?"
"22257410","22257730"," What's not?"
"22257910","22258570"," I can miss a trade."
"22259590","22269270"," I don't have to do too much research on flow algo like you do other other flow"
"22269270","22270690"," flow out flow services."
"22273570","22278730"," So I've switched now back to flow algo exclusively. "
"22283150","22286190"," So within flow algo, there are a bunch of differences."
"22286270","22291130"," They've got dark pools and they track the dark pool signatures on them."
"22291730","22294210"," They could they try to point out if they were bot sold. "
"22295310","22298330"," So they give you different colors on the dark pool."
"22298770","22307670"," And then on the on the flow that comes through, none of it is sell and none of it is"
"22307670","22309070"," it's all it's all by."
"22309370","22310270"," It's all at the ask. "
"22310270","22312850"," It all corresponds to dark pool buys."
"22315330","22318250"," And they sometimes have signatures on even even options."
"22318250","22320070"," Flow has signatures on it sometimes. "
"22320750","22323610"," And they'll track them over the course of days or weeks."
"22323870","22325170"," They have an alpha flow as well."
"22326890","22331770"," So like right now, right on February 4th, our last alpha signal was Tesla. "
"22332650","22337770"," But we haven't had any alpha flow since February 4th."
"22341590","22344010"," So when these stickers come in, they have an algo score."
"22344690","22345950"," And some of them are golden tickets. "
"22346550","22347030"," Some of them are not."
"22348270","22353970"," The ones that are having a high algo score are typically match up with dark pool prints or there's"
"22353970","22359170"," multiple instances of this flow being purchased on this strike or it's hit."
"22360390","22366030"," It's hit on a certain number or where if it's a split, a sweep or a block is a part"
"22366030","22366390"," of it. "
"22366630","22368990"," And then where where were they purchased right?"
"22369090","22369670"," Were they trying to hide?"
"22369790","22370690"," I'm not trying to hide them."
"22371670","22372630"," Sometimes it's flow."
"22372890","22374130"," They try to hide. "
"22383950","22389290"," So I guess the question becomes, into the bell, are you bullish on tomorrow and Wednesday?"
"22391430","22395330"," My guess is that I would be bearish on Tuesday, Wednesday."
"22396310","22401670"," And then bullish on Thursday and then sideways and to Friday for OPECs."
"22403920","22405440"," So I'm going to look at a larger chart here. "
"22406300","22407520"," And let's look at some stuff, right?"
"22407720","22411700"," We traded as low for the month of January, right?"
"22412380","22419960"," Excuse me, the month of February, we started out at roughly $426 on the spy."
"22420900","22424180"," We traded to a high of 460."
"22425200","22427380"," We're currently sitting at 440. "
"22430370","22434490"," So the question would become, do we sell the market down, let's say to 420 and then bring it back"
"22434490","22438410"," up into alignment to 420 into the end of the month?"
"22438950","22441450"," Or do we trade it higher between the rest of the week 460?"
"22442250","22451870"," Or do we trade sideways the next couple of days, just park it for Friday, OPECs would be the"
"22451870","22452310"," question."
"22453250","22462110"," Now, in the month of December, we started at roughly $452."
"22464410","22468250"," We traded high into the 480. "
"22469190","22477450"," So we traded, if you look at December, we traded hot from the December OPECs to the beginning of"
"22477450","22478350"," January."
"22478810","22481210"," We traded from 450 up to 480."
"22482370","22490870"," And we traded down into the January OPECs down to a super fucking low number. "
"22491250","22493430"," I think it was January 18th, we traded down to 455."
"22496270","22507460"," And we're kind of looking the same for kind of looking the same, kind"
"22507460","22510260"," of ish, so down kept selling down."
"22511960","22518500"," I think Winky made of said, he expects us to trade at 453. "
"22520420","22526300"," Is that this month's OPECs or is we talking February 18th, we took these, we took these, remember"
"22526300","22527380"," we took these scores down?"
"22529710","22531090"," We, I think we got ready."
"22531350","22535050"," This is for OPEC's wife's boyfriend said 444, Winky said 450."
"22536670","22537890"," Doboy said 440. "
"22538650","22540170"," I said 440, 442."
"22541530","22543190"," Drink towel said 442."
"22543970","22545190"," Not a suit said 440. "
"22546130","22547310"," Aaron said 428."
"22548530","22550490"," Zach Burton said 449."
"22552130","22554330"," Captain Ron, I think said 448. "
"22555110","22561250"," Hot, hot, hot said 449.50. San, I think that was Ron."
"22561550","22563130"," I don't know who San is said 445."
"22563610","22564990"," We never got Mero's number. "
"22565650","22566750"," I don't know what Mero said."
"22568870","22570250"," Yeah, this is what you guys think."
"22570270","22571110"," I forget this shit. "
"22571770","22573890"," You motherfuckers out there don't think I got my paperwork."
"22574730","22575650"," Sons of bitches."
"22575730","22576170"," Think I forgot?"
"22576910","22577610"," Don't forget shit. "
"22582700","22583880"," You guys thought I forgot?"
"22586040","22587920"," Yeah, February OPEC's this Friday."
"22589780","22592260"," I got my, I got my information right in front of me."
"22599510","22601590"," lingo lingo, you're so far out of the loop, bro. "
"22606310","22607610"," So far out of the loop."
"22610470","22615410"," I swear we got some people that come into this, I swear we got people that come into this feed"
"22615410","22619710"," and they're either listening for like an hour and then they just pop right in and they're like,"
"22620010","22621630"," what the hell are those guys talking about?"
"22625030","22626470"," You guys are all crazy."
"22627950","22632970"," So we took this survey on shit. "
"22633230","22633850"," We took it on."
"22635870","22636750"," We were running."
"22636930","22638670"," We were like near 460, right?"
"22639150","22641810"," We were like, we were at least like 450, 460. "
"22644130","22645790"," Uh oh, we got the presser starting."
"22650130","22654750"," I don't have twins here either, but this is all back when we were running."
"22655010","22656250"," Like we were like running to 460. "
"22659610","22660790"," I saved that paperwork."
"22663730","22664790"," I saved it."
"22668260","22671200"," Yeah, Quinn probably said, Quinn just says it's gonna burn. "
"22674160","22678280"," Now we were talking about, so you guys never noticed, right?"
"22678820","22683360"," When you take a survey of people when we're like really bullish and then you take a survey of"
"22683360","22688080"," people when we're really bearish and everybody's like, everybody's on the same page."
"22688220","22689260"," We're like, it's going to fucking 480."
"22689960","22693500"," And then like the next day it's a bad day and we're like shit, no 400 tomorrow, bro. "
"22693900","22694700"," Opex is doomed."
"22698770","22700230"," Puts the toddlers to sleep."
"22703290","22705230"," You think Quinn said 420?"
"22705790","22706350"," I don't remember. "
"22706510","22709290"," I don't have Quinn's or Mero."
"22709310","22712590"," I'd like to see what both of those guys think now where we're trading into."
"22712850","22717930"," But I'm looking at the Opex date for January and I'm looking for the Opex date. "
"22718770","22724030"," December was kind of November to January's kind of up and down sideways kind of looking for that"
"22724030","22724770"," middle of the road."
"22726890","22730070"," And if we were to take the bottom of the range, right?"
"22730870","22732930"," For this month, the bottom of the range."
"22735470","22736510"," Was 420. "
"22736910","22738850"," The top of the range was 460."
"22739850","22742670"," Sure than shit, we're trading right at 440."
"22744610","22750450"," Wouldn't it be a thing to see us just trade sideways into the Opex on Friday?"
"22750850","22751950"," That would be a shocker. "
"22752830","22756590"," CF 440 or 440 or 435 into Opex."
"22764400","22766420"," Yeah, these pressers are a little too much right now."
"22767260","22770140"," Like standard warranty's may work. "
"22778900","22780600"," Which is kind of surprising."
"22780880","22782260"," So right now, we traded lower."
"22782540","22782960"," We traded 420. "
"22783280","22783740"," We traded 440."
"22784560","22789420"," Trying to get an idea of where the banks want to print for the end of the month."
"22791400","22801980"," If I had to guess, I"
"22801980","22804500"," had to guess they want to print those goddamn 420s on Opex. "
"22805140","22806080"," Be honest with you."
"22816490","22819930"," Where they want to print those 425s, they'll do whatever they can to print them."
"22826700","22827100"," Yeah. "
"22827560","22829760"," Now you rip up because it's all on my calls in the dump."
"22831890","22833130"," Yes, bias is still struggling."
"22838790","22839490"," Yeah, lingo. "
"22839590","22839930"," We took that."
"22840010","22840790"," I think we took that."
"22841190","22842590"," I think we took that, um. "
"22844570","22847170"," We took that pole, like we were cranking to 460."
"22848870","22851670"," And we're like, oh yeah, 440 is going to be hard."
"22852170","22853090"," No way we're printing. "
"22853090","22854170"," I was even thinking the same thing."
"22854230","22854670"," I'm not going to lie."
"22854790","22856250"," I was like, there ain't no fucking way we're printing 440. "
"22857770","22862210"," Of course I want to print 440 because I've got the 440p put spreads."
"22863770","22864950"," But now we're down to 435."
"22868670","22875210"," Shit, watch this trade up to 450 then down to 435 heading into into Friday. "
"22876030","22876770"," That wouldn't shock me."
"22887950","22891050"," And this stuff's all like this is all like parking stuff, right?"
"22891050","22893030"," We got more more Hertz calls."
"22893650","22895370"," I'm not seeing nothing right now, guys. "
"22902730","22905610"," Like Hertz, February 18th, 20c."
"22908390","22911910"," QQQ's February 16th, 348c."
"22915830","22917630"," Spy just for today. "
"22918950","22919550"," 435c."
"22920310","22921770"," That seems like a decent bed in the close."
"22923350","22924950"," 453,000 dollars. "
"22930290","22931370"," Looks like they're parking it."
"22941020","22942980"," Might see a short covering in the close."
"22943680","22945480"," I might trade this into the bell. "
"22959110","22959730"," Let's see."

"23514230","23515490"," Don't fence Mariette."
"23518390","23521630"," I like the trade, but it's been pumped up pretty high, hasn't it?"
"23522330","23524530"," Or is it more like a home depot in there?"
"23524610","23525630"," Well, I shouldn't say that."
"23526710","23529450"," Mariette's one of the core hotels in our system, right?"

"23585070","23589510"," I don't know if I like Mariette."
"23590430","23593650"," Even if it was to hit 180, it's probably going to sell off."
"23594170","23595510"," That's a tough trade, Mariette. "
"23596510","23598850"," Even if it hit 180, it's probably going to sell off."

"23815560","23816380"," Like they don't go drinking."
"23816860","23820620"," They'd some do, but you know, they tend not to do that stuff."
"23822620","23828840"," So when you're looking for someone that's, you know, they don't drink, they don't women eyes or man"
"23828840","23832500"," eyes or they don't do drugs, never have tri drugs. "

"23940490","23944010"," And it looks like we're trading higher into the bell here. "
"23944450","23949470"," If you're bearish, buying some puts at the bell, probably something to do."
"23951810","23957470"," So I was in the army and I didn't want or I was in, well, I was out of high"

"23978410","23980410"," I got like the highest score you can get."
"23981810","23983170"," I think I got a single question wrong."
"23984990","23994060"," So I get pulled aside and they're like, hey, you know, you did so well in this way to take"
"23994060","23995480"," a, let's call it a D-Lab. "
"23997000","23999960"," It's a defense language aptitude battery test, I think it's called."
"24001780","24005060"," So I take that test and you make up languages and shit."
"24006660","24009700"," I give you like letters and numbers and you have to make up or they make up where you have"
"24009700","24011320"," to figure out the language on your own. "
"24011980","24014120"," And if you pass that test, then they give you another test."
"24015440","24024730"," And so I passed these two tests and they were like, oh, okay, you're gonna, we're gonna send you to"
"24024730","24028330"," a, it's in California."
"24029990","24032330"," Everything, uh, what is the name of the place in California?"
"24034030","24036370"," Anyways, this is place in California where you go to language school. "
"24038010","24039870"," And so they take you inside this room."
"24043670","24053440"," And, uh, I take you in this room and they're like, asking"
"24053440","24054800"," you all these questions, right?"
"24055480","24057740"," Like you ever smoked weed and like hell no, never smoked weed."
"24057920","24060460"," So I'm like, you lying to me. "
"24061020","24066380"," And I'm like, no, you know, that's these stupid fucking questions and they pull everything."
"24066380","24067760"," They go to speak to your family."
"24068260","24069880"," They fucking go and speak to your friends. "
"24069880","24074380"," They fucking speak to fucking everybody everybody I fucking grew up with."
"24074720","24076400"," They ask your fucking neighbors shit."
"24076820","24077560"," It's all wild. "
"24079780","24081280"," They want to know your personal character."
"24082100","24085800"," Yes, we're pinned into the clothes, right?"
"24086440","24087100"," Right around 440."
"24087480","24088800"," Got some VIX puts coming in. "
"24089920","24091480"," Well, let me know what you guys are doing on the bell."
"24091640","24092320"," I'm flat right now."
"24096330","24100210"," So I think we're gonna be, I think it's danger into the clothes. "
"24106260","24107420"," Yeah, Monterey, that's it."
"24108080","24108840"," You guys got it."
"24109360","24109940"," It's Monterey. "
"24110800","24111960"," Defense language school."
"24112740","24113120"," Exactly."
"24115380","24116140"," It's Monterey. "
"24116780","24117560"," That place is nice."
"24118940","24119880"," This place is real nice."
"24128880","24131000"," Yeah, it's the mind Monterey. "
"24131900","24137500"," So I ended up failing my background check."
"24139200","24140720"," So I get back in line scrub."
"24142000","24142800"," So I'm like, okay. "
"24143380","24149000"," And then I ended up becoming a driver for some some generals."
"24150920","24154880"," When I went to my test, they are my background check again and I passed."
"24157280","24158640"," Yeah, for my clearances. "
"24160900","24164980"," So lo and behold, I wound up getting the clearances that I needed down the road."
"24167120","24169200"," But after all that bullshit, I didn't go to language school."
"24169840","24170160"," It sucked. "
"24175650","24177810"," Yeah, I wouldn't be holding long into EPI numbers."
"24178490","24179130"," There's no reason."
"24186060","24190480"," And if you didn't get a chance to get some put spreads now is the time. "
"24196590","24204510"," We know we have a high concentration of 420Ps expiring on 425Ps expiring on the 18th."
"24211390","24212350"," Okay, so that's the bell."
"24213710","24215550"," That was my military story for you today. "
"24217170","24217830"," D-Lab."
"24219270","24220230"," I remember that now."
"24220710","24222070"," French language, I have to do a battery test. "
"24222890","24224030"," Can you guys out there take that test?"
"24225270","24226230"," The test is pretty cool."
"24229860","24234920"," And I remember the first test I took, there was like maybe 20 or 30 of us."
"24235540","24237800"," And then the second test that I took, there was maybe like 10 of us. "
"24239280","24244000"," And I heard that there were more tests above it, but I only passed it to the first two, that"
"24244000","24244280"," was it."
"24246100","24248220"," Unless there's, unless that's it, then we have two tests."
"24248420","24248700"," I don't know. "
"24248860","24250120"," I thought there were more tests above that."
"24256950","24257910"," Yeah, I'm fucking flat."
"24258410","24260070"," There ain't no goddamn way I'm holding it tomorrow. "
"24261990","24263090"," I got some other shit."
"24263210","24264110"," I got some run calls."
"24265090","24270270"," I've got like a bunch of other crap and other brokerages, but as far as like spy, what am I"
"24270270","24270550"," doing tomorrow?"
"24271570","24272970"," I'm fully fucking flat right now. "
"24274390","24277570"," Lots of money on some calls from this morning."
"24278570","24282990"," I ended up selling those for, I ended up losing like 60% on those."
"24283730","24287870"," But then I made a shit ton on puts like hundreds of percent. "
"24288190","24289150"," So I'm up on the day."
"24291870","24292830"," Which is all it matters."
"24295630","24298990"," I'm now willing to hold into tomorrow. "
"24299890","24301370"," It could be a squeeze much higher."
"24301830","24306250"," If, if PPI comes in, I don't see how they don't come in hot tomorrow."
"24306570","24308410"," I don't like this whole Ukraine thing. "
"24309150","24313590"," I don't, I'm getting to this point in the market where, I'll be honest with you, I'm again to this"
"24313590","24319950"," point in the market where I think I'm going to start closing almost everything and only holding for"
"24319950","24320970"," the day in either direction."
"24321910","24324830"," I don't like the idea right now of holding."
"24326110","24328750"," And there's a lot of moves made in the overnight right now too. "
"24330670","24338810"," You know, I've made a lot of good ones in the overnight holds, but I don't like because right now,"
"24338870","24341590"," I mean, on a normal day, I'll be honest with you on a normal day."
"24343270","24351290"," Any day of the week, looking at, so looking at any, if I was looking at this chart in the"
"24351290","24361260"," last two years, right, and I was looking at this chart last two years, I would have bought"
"24361260","24362280"," the fuck out of that close."
"24364440","24365940"," I would have bought the fuck out of it. "
"24366180","24369820"," I would have bought that with a lot of money."
"24370380","24374120"," A lot of money."
"24375440","24380120"," Trying to look back to see if there's anywhere I wouldn't have bought that close. "
"24384640","24387060"," Yeah, I would have bought that close all day long."
"24389760","24391340"," At any other time, what about that close?"
"24395420","24397280"," Hands down, what about that close?"
"24399480","24400620"," Under normal circumstances."
"24406300","24409060"," It'd be all in right now in that close, but I can't right now. "
"24412580","24424060"," We get the tapped down below at 4.35. We rechecked it again this afternoon at 2.10. We"
"24424060","24425520"," didn't sell off below it."
"24427140","24433960"," Had we sold off below 4.35, that would have been the time for us to sell off, right?"
"24434740","24435880"," We didn't."
"24437800","24441720"," So the only other thing that I could see would be that we trade up and about. "
"24442020","24445180"," We would trade a right to resistance on the bell."
"24446380","24452580"," I would say that futures are flat tonight, maybe slightly high."
"24453480","24456920"," I'll give you to maybe 4.41 in the overnight. "
"24458360","24461960"," And if PPI numbers come in hot at fucking 8.30, sell the fucking news."
"24464850","24466410"," They didn't even try to pump it up."
"24466950","24468170"," That's another concern, right?"
"24468730","24470590"," They didn't pump up into the bell on this. "
"24471970","24474910"," It wasn't like a ripper to save PPI numbers."
"24477210","24479270"," Boom, right there after the bell."
"24480570","24485410"," We'll be here till 4.15. So a 4.03 PM spy puts. "
"24486970","24487810"," You ready?"
"24489250","24494870"," Spy puts after the bell, March 18th, 4.15 PM, million dollars."
"24496350","24507640"," Stick around till 4.15. Yeah,"
"24507740","24510020"," that 4.35 P trade was fucking stupid."
"24511260","24512140"," I'm not going to lie. "
"24513160","24514280"," The trade was stupid."
"24517020","24522560"," I went from 60% down on a bunch of shit."
"24523700","24525960"," I had a bunch of calls coming into today too. "
"24526980","24529000"," And I was down a lot on a bunch of shit."
"24529640","24533260"," And then I doubled down on some calls, lost some more fucking money."
"24533980","24536780"," And then I was able to recover, get rid of them. "
"24536920","24542620"," I sold out of them as we traded up into that 4.41. And then I bought some puts and"
"24542620","24543500"," printed fat."
"24545360","24547920"," So all the premium interest is on the put side."
"24548500","24550780"," There's no premium interest in the call side right now. "
"24554080","24559710"," And just heading into tomorrow, I don't know, we could trade sideways."
"24561570","24564410"," If even a PPA, I mean, I don't know what to say at this point."
"24564830","24565250"," It's tough. "
"24565990","24568030"," This market's real fucking hard right now."
"24568430","24571030"," Just today it's hard."
"24573010","24575010"," It hasn't been that hard until today. "
"24576010","24580450"," I don't like the fucking, like when we sold off on Friday, that was a great trade."
"24581010","24581850"," Made a lot of money."
"24581850","24583590"," I don't like those trades though. "
"24583790","24588070"," I don't like, I don't like trading those trades."
"24592330","24593570"," Do you guys like trading those trades?"
"24597750","24599070"," Because I don't like those trades."
"24599450","24603950"," I don't like trading on unlike Ukraine news. "
"24604650","24609950"," I don't like trading right now on both the bullshits."
"24610150","24612050"," So to me, the CPI numbers are bullshit."
"24613030","24614330"," And we sold on them. "
"24614330","24622830"," So I'm getting the any excuse we sell vibes."
"24622910","24625550"," It doesn't matter what the excuse is."
"24625550","24630510"," You can just throw out fake news right now and it's going to sell in every fucking moment. "
"24635890","24637310"," Yeah, the market did kick the end on that."
"24642060","24643220"," Yeah, it's a tough day."
"24643480","24645180"," And the market is now really tough. "
"24646420","24648880"," I think so good news is not raising the market up."
"24649760","24655160"," And bad news, whether it's real or not, is selling this market heavily."
"24656300","24657260"," With effect. "
"24664510","24665950"," Most of them turned out to be lucky."
"24666230","24667810"," Dude, I got lucky to my first trade."
"24668130","24670210"," My first put trade wasn't lucky. "
"24670390","24670750"," I made money."
"24671870","24674510"," But then I went back in again and that was pure fucking luck."
"24676170","24678950"," I knew it wouldn't last long and it went up really fast. "
"24679290","24679870"," So I got out."
"24679870","24684450"," But I know for a fact that I had I stayed in like another minute or two longer, I'd be"
"24684450","24684690"," fucked."
"24685950","24686830"," So I got in fucked. "
"24695210","24698030"," Yeah, very true, Jess."
"24699410","24701270"," Yeah, we've got some volatility ahead of us."
"24701450","24702310"," Whether you like it or not. "
"24702510","24705290"," I don't care if even if fucking even if the CPI numbers are good."
"24707690","24710450"," You've got even if the CPI numbers are good."
"24712250","24715890"," You've got no matter what, you've got volatility for the minutes. "
"24716870","24721430"," And that alone will keep us trading sideways and anticipate show the minutes on Wednesday."
"24722410","24728270"," So without seeing anything in the reports earning, my guess is going to be a range bound for"
"24730090","24737390"," Wednesday's minutes and to the downside on any bad news."
"24738450","24741530"," Anything could be anything and it doesn't have to be real. "
"24742790","24744630"," We saw it today with news."
"24744970","24745770"," You saw it this morning."
"24746390","24748370"," You saw conflicting reports coming out. "
"24748370","24752110"," You saw even you can even notice it and trade the news."
"24752410","24758290"," They're not reporting things until after now because nobody can substantiate what's real and what's"
"24758290","24758490"," fake."
"24759090","24762370"," And you've got the government doing crazy shit as well. "
"24762630","24765230"," The government's responses right now are in called for."
"24765370","24768990"," They should just keep quiet and say what they want to say and don't say anything else."
"24770550","24773950"," So there's there's there's mass manipulation right now in the market. "
"24784740","24785260"," Yeah."
"24785260","24790420"," Yeah, do you want to look at the book map for Tesla after ours?"
"24791780","24793300"," I don't know if it's fragile."
"24793680","24800860"," I think that it's I don't know exactly what it is. "
"24800880","24802540"," I'm trying to figure out what it is right now."
"24803260","24805780"," I've been thinking about it and thinking about it and thinking about it and thinking about it."
"24813530","24817150"," There's there's like an argument that the market's doing the work for the Fed. "
"24817550","24819510"," I don't like that argument right now."
"24822190","24827970"," I don't like the argument that it looks like fucking distribution, man."
"24828170","24828870"," It fucking does. "
"24829830","24831710"," Looks like the market is selling off."
"24832990","24836290"," I don't like the noise when we trade it up to one star to 460."
"24836890","24842310"," I don't like the bull saying shit like, you know, we're going to the moon and that kind of stuff. "
"24846030","24854890"," There's a point in the market right now where almost well, there was a there was a point where you"
"24854890","24856290"," didn't have to listen to the news."
"24856810","24866130"," And now you do being required attention to the news and but the social media, you got to kind of"
"24866130","24867770"," have to stay off of and just watch the news."
"24868090","24868370"," I don't know. "
"24868410","24868910"," It's kind of weird."
"24869670","24872470"," Market dynamics right now are are challenged."
"24876170","24879530"," And I was thinking about all the bad news that came out into Friday. "
"24881230","24886630"," And then the government didn't do anything over the weekend to quell that news until just before"
"24886630","24887450"," the open this morning."
"24888130","24889110"," All that shit is timed."
"24889490","24893290"," All that shit is they know when to and when not to do that stuff. "
"24893750","24897070"," So it's concerning to me that the White House is now involved in this."
"24902730","24906350"," They have more players than sellers on after our here."
"24906450","24907830"," Not a lot of information than I can see. "
"24909210","24910610"," And it's just frozen right now."
"24920260","24921880"," Yeah, I think we're going down this here too."
"24922420","24926980"," I still have that overall bearish like that overall bearish market viewpoint. "
"24930550","24934410"," I don't know if they sell it down now though or if they sell it down."
"24934770","24937650"," I only concern with the big sell down later in the years again."
"24939110","24945510"," A lot of the speculative growth stocks are already down so far that we might not get that impact"
"24945510","24946250"," later on. "
"24946710","24951010"," You know that that sell down to like below 300s or mid 300s or whatever."
"24951670","24953370"," And we would traditionally sell down to."
"24953830","24956690"," Okay, so we've got three more minutes left to the market close. "
"24957390","24963110"," We'll see if there's anything that we see into this bell."
"24963790","24966530"," A lot of accumulation after hours on Tesla."
"24969840","24971700"," We did have that million dollar put. "
"24972980","24974880"," March 18th for 15p."
"24975320","24981980"," There are also puts at 409 and 390 I think down on March 18th on that OPEC."
"24990760","24993640"," You should see some selling in the overnight from that trade as well. "
"25011190","25013390"," Yeah, three more minutes left to see if anything comes in after the bell."
"25020070","25023610"," And you see how quiet the market is right now after hours."
"25023610","25024710"," I mean, this is unusual. "
"25032160","25032960"," No volume."
"25039970","25041510"," Amazon's printing largest size after close."
"25045330","25046510"," Yeah, tomorrow should be fun. "
"25047450","25049250"," All right, so you guys have a wonderful day."
"25049350","25050990"," We have a one minute left to the market close here."
"25051450","25053530"," Hope everybody did well to hope nobody got blown out. "
"25054370","25056910"," I have a lot to look at here in the market."
"25057630","25059290"," I'm going to try to spend some time."
"25059290","25063430"," I'm trying to figure out what's more going on that meets the eye right now in the market. "
"25064270","25065030"," I don't know."
"25065230","25068770"," I've tried to find out if anyone else has a finger on what's going on in the market."
"25071730","25072770"," It's tough to see. "
"25072910","25074330"," Markets flashing red, we know that."
"25074670","25077390"," We know we've known that since January at the markets flashing red."
"25081270","25085030"," But that doesn't mean you can, you know, if you're a short down of 420, it doesn't mean you can"
"25085030","25086510"," be short a little bit 460 either. "
"25087150","25090230"," We were going down to 420 and we're trading up to 460."
"25091590","25094130"," And now we're trading right back down to 435."
"25094530","25095450"," The market is wild. "
"25098660","25106020"," It almost, it almost, it's the kind of market that you almost don't take trades in until you hit"
"25106020","25107880"," another high and then you just short again."
"25110700","25114080"," One other note too would be, let's take a look at this."
"25114180","25115640"," I want to see one other note here. "
"25117220","25125270"," So you figure on, yeah, so we had a red month in January."
"25126670","25127930"," Just a note, right?"
"25128030","25129330"," This is probably important stuff to know."
"25130450","25139510"," Looks like we closed, we closed at 450 on January"
"25139510","25141470"," 31st. "
"25142750","25148070"," We closed at 450 on the 31st and we're down on this month."
"25149030","25159730"," So just to be clear, you know, we're at 440 and we're 100 points down from our"
"25159730","25166590"," open on the 1st, right?"
"25166810","25167770"," We closed the month out."
"25167910","25175460"," We closed the month of January out of 450 and we're, you know, we closed. "
"25177160","25178180"," See, we closed it."
"25178700","25179880"," See, we closed that here."
"25180020","25181020"," Just get away, 450. "
"25181980","25187600"," And then we closed December out at 480 or ish, let's say 477."
"25187600","25191220"," Some, you know, it was a 475, right?"
"25191360","25193720"," We closed at 450 on January."
"25195180","25199040"," We're at 435 or 440, you know, inevitably right now. "
"25199040","25207130"," If we close down on the month of February, that means we don't trade to 450."
"25211750","25214710"," And that's putting together a quarter, our negative quarter."
"25215530","25217090"," And we've talked about this in previous days. "
"25217550","25225710"," So if we put together two negative quarters and then if we put together another negative month,"
"25225730","25227190"," that makes it a negative quarter, right?"
"25227490","25229970"," February or December, it's going to be January and February are negative."
"25230290","25231390"," It doesn't matter what March is."
"25231990","25238650"," If March is a negative quarter though, if you get three straight in a row, you're going to fucking"
"25238650","25239350"," do some damage. "
"25240370","25248910"," Like real damage to the market because you're going to have to trade lower than 450 into end of"
"25248910","25249130"," month."
"25250570","25254230"," You trade down a 400 or 390 or something for March."
"25255690","25259210"," I don't know how you, I mean, you can recover from it for April. "
"25259210","25261070"," You can recover for it from like April, May."
"25262190","25267350"," Like you'll recover, but you could trade back down even deeper, right?"
"25267490","25270950"," The damage is done long term is the problem."
"25271330","25274750"," The problem is down the road on that stuff. "
"25282580","25283820"," Hey, you guys all have a great night."
"25284900","25285940"," Check you all out tomorrow."
"25287400","25289240"," And thanks for everybody that supports the channel. "

"25298240","25299920"," This stuff costs me a lot of money."
