"GcqTWLzk_xA","211600","214160"," So should say a quick pullback right here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","214560","218560"," And all they have to do is beat this one right here this previous high right here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","218560","224560"," Which they're doing right now and then you should see a bounce back a check on the one minute trigger and then a quick rip up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","225000","227920"," Here on spy make sure you can see this in frame"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","232240","234240"," Subscribers any"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","266600","272040"," Kind of pissed off that I said turn the stream on this morning, right? So I turned the stream on this morning and"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","273800","277000"," It so it went unlisted on YouTube and"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","277840","283440"," I was making so I have a bunch of it. I got a bunch of training films. I have been when I was sick, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","284400","287880"," Oh, yeah, when I was sick. I started making well"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","287880","290960"," I got sick and then I felt better, but my brain didn't feel right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","291640","296480"," So I did have some time to make training videos. I wind up. I wound up making I think"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","297360","303480"," 30 training videos and I have another five or ten big ones that I haven't filmed yet"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","304720","307440"," But last night I oh I might jump on this here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","308040","311200"," So see this right here see this pullback right here. See this little"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","311680","313880"," It's a little thing right here. This is gonna be a check"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","315640","320480"," This is gonna be a back check of the let's go over to the trigger chart really quick. So"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","321880","326600"," I apologize for some of my videos here because last night I was doing a bunch of stuff, but"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","328840","330480"," This is a"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","330480","333120"," So this is a strategy that you can use on"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","333960","339280"," This is a strategy you can use with this tool. I want to discuss this strategy really quick. So if"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","340240","346920"," You're watching price underneath the hourly trigger and the hourly trigger, which is the green line is coming down, right? You're bearish"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","348600","350200"," Okay"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","350200","355440"," Now if the green line begins to flatten which it's doing right now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","356080","358240"," It's becoming a little bit more neutral"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","358960","360960"," If it starts to add higher"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","361640","363640"," becomes more bullish"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","364640","372280"," Now saying that right in a three hour time period one two and three three hour time period"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","372280","380600"," So think about the stock market. We talk about half hour 15 minutes half hours hours days weeks months years all that kind of stuff on a daily basis"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","382360","389160"," Be thinking about three hour periods. So nine thirty ten thirty eleven thirty is your first one your second one is"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","389360","391360"," eleven thirty twelve thirty one thirty"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","391720","395200"," Then think about your next one as one thirty two thirty three thirty"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","395760","400280"," In the stock market then you go three thirty four thirty five thirty and then they close that shit at six"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","400280","402560"," Oh, then you get the nine p.m. Stuff too, but"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","403960","408240"," Start thinking about the stock market like that. So what you want to be doing is back checking"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","408920","411800"," price action the previous three hours and"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","412760","416880"," If you look here right down here, this is two p.m. Right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","417880","420560"," And this right here is one p.m. This is one thirty"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","420960","427360"," But right around this eleven thirty mark we started to consolidate for this for this three hour period and"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","428080","433280"," You can see the hourly trend is whole is actually flattening and becoming bullish"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","433760","437080"," So as this is taking place if you were to say to yourself"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","438280","441280"," Is this bullish consolidation or bearish?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","442280","445160"," So far it's bullish consolidation"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","445640","450240"," If you were to see the if you were to see the hourly trigger"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","451200","453200"," Continue to the downside"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","454440","459280"," Let's say price was flat, but you saw this hourly trigger heading down still"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","459720","461720"," It would be giving you bearish"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","462840","468400"," Connotations even if we if price was bouncing like this right now and you saw this happening"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","468560","473360"," It would be bearish connotation, but this is neutral to slightly bullish"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","474360","482840"," With a consolidation, so if you were to run this trade a bunch times you'd find out that it's actually it's actually bullish in the end of the day"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","484040","489600"," For an upside move so and we're starting to see that you actually see this price action right here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","489600","495920"," You had this previous high right here right and fascinatingly enough probably a dealer came in"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","495920","501360"," I saw this action right here and dealers came swoop like swooped bang bang bang"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","501920","504120"," Right and they took price down on"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","505240","507920"," 457 I think we're like 24 cents up here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","507920","513240"," They slammed it down to like 10 or 12 cents and sure enough they came right back up and slammed it up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","513240","519320"," And we actually got we beat we failed the previous high here, but we beat both of these eyes"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","519920","524480"," Right here, so we'll see if we can catch a quick another rip up to the upside"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","525040","529160"," Or at least beat this high right here. Oh do we already do that and see if we beat that one"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","530000","535320"," Let me snap a line and just see if we think it's something more technical here and see if we beat this previous line right here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","538120","540120"," Yeah, that's close"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","540760","545360"," I'm looking for this. I'm looking for a beat of this previous high right there"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","546000","551840"," That one right there looks like it's almost it's like neutral not beats not not beat"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","551840","554520"," So I've got a neutral stance right now if we're gonna go up there"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","554680","559800"," I would have really liked to have seen like a real small tick maybe one tick one penny higher and"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","560360","561440"," It would be"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","561440","566000"," Approving that upside move. So we'll see what happens. Maybe it is more neutral. I was saying it was bullish, but"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","566680","570840"," This little not beat right here. That just took place kind of gives me some caution"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","571360","574160"," So we might buy this though for this next rip to the upside"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","574160","578720"," We'll check this one out here in just a minute. Either way, this is more neutral than bearish"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","578920","584480"," Definitely not bearish and it is looking like it's turning bullish because of the time the three hours that we spent"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","584520","589560"," On this on this hourly trigger. So bulls a little bit in charge right now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","589560","592640"," See if we can go up here and try to trade this 447 47"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","592640","598360"," We might have some similar price action today to some of our previous days as well because there are"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","599560","601560"," 420,000"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","602040","608760"," 457 C's on the board right now, so they're not gonna want to print those bad boys this that that'll that'll"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","609840","612880"," Kind of or can pin the market slightly"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","613120","617960"," Well, it's been a lot of prep pay those out for like two three dollars something like that sometimes they do"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","618320","621360"," But they burned them all already they burned all those calls already"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","621360","626520"," And so maybe they'll give us a little bit on the back end of this trade if you're holding those calls"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","626640","628840"," You might get a little bit of back end to the upside"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","630480","633760"," Okay, so hold on one second here. I guess a bunch of stuff I gotta do"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","635520","638040"," I missed you know, why am I missing all this stuff like"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","638800","640800"," I'm missing a bunch of stuff here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","641640","644560"," You guys see me on I did I can't see me"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","656520","658520"," Can I refresh the chat? Okay"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","826720","828720"," I"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","832760","840480"," Didn't see this what you wrote. I don't know if you saw this before because the chat issue any feelings towards charting patterns"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","841440","843520"," Yes, we incorporate"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","843520","847160"," Well, yes and no, I don't know if they're the same chart patterns that you're thinking about"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","848160","852320"," The chart patterns that I use are geared towards this tool"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","853480","855960"," And that's the only chart patterns that I use"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","856720","860000"," I I keep on zigzag channels on"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","860960","865440"," Multi-time frames, but that's about it as long as we're staying in channel and stuff like that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","865440","868840"," I'll pay attention to that stuff, but I don't put a lot of proof into"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","870200","872200"," traditional charting methods"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","872200","875760"," I don't not a fan of them. It's a matter of fact this tool beats"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","876480","879600"," oftentimes I'll go on Twitter and I'll see people"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","880640","882480"," posting a lot of"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","882480","884480"," traditional charting stuff and"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","885160","889480"," They get beat by this tool because of it they get torched because of it"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","890280","894520"," They don't know real support where we're real resistances in the market. So"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","895160","902200"," Do I use it? Yeah, but I'm not I used to I'll say that I used to use traditional charting patterns back in the day"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","902200","908760"," It worked okay for me, but now I wouldn't trade without this in any way shape or form"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","908760","912360"," I would never be caught dead without trade without trading with this tool"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","912360","920360"," But yeah, I guess I use I use he's a little bit of a chart or a little bit of"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","943120","949160"," Some flags and penance and all that kind of stuff, but not because I believe in them more that I know that people trade to them"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","949160","951600"," That's about it. That's as far as I go with chart patterns"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","992440","994440"," very thick strong"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","994520","999080"," Cable for its size. It's pretty strong. It's like this really hard ABS plastic"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","999600","1002720"," It's very thin, but it's probably like a maybe like a"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1003480","1005320"," 16 or 18 gauge"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1005320","1009440"," No, it's not 18. It's like 16 gauge double cable"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1010000","1012960"," Looks like an old extension cord type"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1013720","1016480"," cable, right? It's really really stiff and stuff"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1017160","1019160"," what they do is they run it"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1019520","1021520"," from a from a"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1021520","1023760"," like a small junction box into"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1024440","1026440"," a modem, right and"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1026680","1028760"," this little junction box that they had"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1030200","1034320"," Normally what they should do is put the hard cable into the box"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1035000","1037600"," right they attach the hard cable and"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1038440","1042720"," Then they cut off a piece of this very ultra thin"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1043640","1049360"," That's the actual fiber cable and they attach that through this like they wind it up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1049360","1051360"," And then they use a plug and stuff like that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1051760","1053760"," Whoever installed this stuff in my house"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1055200","1061480"," Instead of it or how they attach the hard cable was with a small little zip tie that was loose and"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1062160","1067840"," Wasn't pinning the wire before they before they used the really super thin like the"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1068480","1075000"," millimeter thick was even smaller than mill. It's got like a 30 gauge fiber wire. It's super small and"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1076040","1078040"," So it was like hanging from that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1078680","1086040"," The actual fiber cable was just like in there hanging with the stiff cable not really attached"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1086600","1093480"," So all this weight was on it and it just snapped its glasses encased in a very thin plastic and"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1094560","1096560"," They wound up snapping so"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1097320","1104120"," The internet was fucking around yesterday and then this morning it finally fucking gave and I reset reset reset reset"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1104160","1105400"," Couldn't figure it out"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1105400","1110720"," Life was like on the phone and stuff and then I went and checked it visual inspection on the inside"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1110720","1117680"," I'm like these fucking clowns these fucking clowns didn't do that this asshole didn't attach the cable. It's kind of like"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1118320","1120320"," It's kind of like if you were to"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1120920","1128080"," Go to a cable box or something if you're to go to like a fuse box and you put like the main feeder in and you didn't screw down the"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1129360","1133640"," The main cable with the sheathing on it before you before you slipped in the"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1134120","1135320"," the"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1135320","1137320"," them the"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1137320","1143560"," The coax but the THN HN that's inside of that cable. So it just broke. So"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1144200","1149480"," My wife was like it's a hundred bucks for them to come here and fix this and you can't repair this stuff"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1149480","1153720"," It's like you can't you can there's some people that can join shit, but"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1154280","1158520"," I was like you I was like you need to do this whole entire thing and have those guys come back"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1158520","1160280"," They're gonna charge her or charge her $100"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1160600","1165520"," And so I took a bunch of pictures and I was like, you know, you can see that this installation is dog shit"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1166320","1170160"," So they they waved it and I was I didn't think they were gonna wave the fee"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1170680","1176680"," Because my whole experience in life has been with Comcast and Comcast fucking sucks"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1177400","1182280"," If anybody if any guys are paid. Oh, what's going on right there? So if any guys ever paid for Comcast"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1183400","1188840"," It really blows. It's like, you know, like fuck you is basically what they tell you at every every turn, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1189400","1193320"," And for all the hate that I have for these large corporations, I got to say"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1194760","1198840"," Bravo to to att because she emailed them the pictures"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1199400","1202040"," And they said we'll come out and fix it free of charge"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1202200","1206760"," So I'm pretty stoked at that they weren't trying to nickel and dime me and all that other shit that they do right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1207000","1213000"," All the fake charges and the I don't know you're paid by credit card fee and the service fee for making a phone call"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1213400","1216600"," And the fee for making an email and yo, you said there's a picture that's 50 cents"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1217320","1219320"," Like all that kind of stupid show that you get"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1219640","1225560"," Taxed on by these companies. So I'm actually very happy right now that came out and did that and I kind of took care"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1225720","1228520"," Kind of took care of us here. We have blood right now, dude"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1229960","1234440"," Look at that blood dealers selling into the market right now. They're just not giving a chance"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1235000","1237640"," Not giving a chance to uh the market here. Are they?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1238440","1240840"," And the all goes we didn't get a new high back here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1240920","1245320"," So we'll have to try to buy that one more time and try to see if we can buy that on that red bar there and"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1245800","1247800"," Send this bad boy up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1248120","1254120"," So the uh, so that's all said and done and it's all fixed supposedly and so what happened with my how I caught my wife with him was"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1254600","1256040"," um"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1256040","1261640"," We're uh, so this this whole fiber thing, right? I had them run it longer than I wanted them to"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1261800","1263960"," I like made it extra long"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1263960","1270040"," I was like when the guys were first and saw I'm like put I'm like give me extra 30 feet or something because I want to eventually install it"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1270760","1272760"," in a different place in my house"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1273560","1282120"," And so it's all like it's like all in a bundle on a table on an exterior wall or the interior of the exterior wall of my house"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1282680","1287560"," And so it was just all sitting over there and the guys like, you know, you can't you shouldn't be doing this over here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1288040","1289800"," And like why is it all over here?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1289800","1293960"," Why isn't it mounted and all this other stuff and trying to like a man's plane tour"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1294280","1297000"," So I had to like go to this guy and be like hey fuck. Oh like"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1297560","1300280"," I didn't say fuck. Oh, but I'm like as soon as he saw me"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1300280","1305560"," I was like you trying to tell her that that was mounted properly in that junction box"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1305720","1310360"," I'm like let's look at it together. I was like you got this thick-ass cable that's uh"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1311000","1314920"," being being uh like it was like zip tied inside of the junction box"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1315480","1318920"," Loose you could you could just pull the hard plastic piece out in and out"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1319400","1323960"," I'm like this isn't how you fucking install anything and you know what i'm installing this is not it"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1324040","1326600"," You know, it's just like a like a ghetto install of some kind"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1327320","1329960"," No, so as soon as I said that he was like, oh fuck there's a guy here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1335880","1339480"," Yeah, Comcast is the worst ever uh they're they're the absolute fucking worst"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1341320","1343320"," Absolute worst no buy so far here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1343960","1348280"," No, Bob. This all looks like manipulation to me. It doesn't look bearish in any way. She ever formed right now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1348760","1351080"," uh, there's a little tiny cross right here, but"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1352040","1356840"," Let's see if we can jump on some of these 457s in a moment here get some panic going on"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1356840","1359320"," So we can get that get that squeeze that's up there in just a moment"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1360600","1365560"," Uh what else do I have to go over so let me go to my uh twitter home page here and talk about a few things"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1365640","1369560"," So some posts that I made this morning uh important posts"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1370440","1375720"," I think I made one last night too. That's very important too and I did do some reposts this morning, too"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1375720","1379880"," No, so we're gonna we're gonna do some chatting here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1379960","1385160"," I'm just gonna bring some of this stuff up a second, uh better explain some of this stuff"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1387720","1389720"," Uh, let me go over to"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1389720","1391960"," I'm just gonna go over this and see if this helps so"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1392760","1399480"," Okay, so my screen right here some posts that I made uh, I made this post yesterday. This is spx gamma"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1400200","1405800"," Uh, buy and sell the range until a break above or below with a back test or two upside has nice development"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1405800","1408040"," But the floor is glass easy peasy"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1408760","1410760"," So we're gonna take a look at uh"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1411480","1415880"," We're gonna take a look at book map really quick and explain that better"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1417960","1419960"," And uh"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1419960","1421960"," I'm gonna do this real quick"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1424920","1426920"," No, no, no, you guys want some cool"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1427720","1433320"," Is that on this chart or no, maybe not. Oh, let me type one second"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1435480","1439720"," Let's go back to that chart right there and we're gonna go to"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1441240","1443400"," Gamma and we're gonna look at gamma really quick"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1447160","1449160"," Excuse me"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1450440","1454680"," Okay, we're gonna go over gamma really quick. So this is the chart that I put up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1457640","1459400"," Yesterday"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1459400","1462120"," And uh, what my point yesterday was"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1462760","1466760"," Uh, that you should be buying these dips right selling these rips down"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1467400","1472280"," Whenever we're down here. You should be buying dips. All right. This is this morning, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1473320","1475320"," Uh, let me see I bring this over here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1477160","1479160"," So you can see it right there. Whoop"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1479560","1480440"," Right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1480440","1482120"," So this is uh"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1482120","1485560"," Monday right here, right? This is Tuesday right here, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1487080","1491800"," When we're down here, you're buying these dips and we're up here. You're trying to sell these dips now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1491800","1495640"," There's a little bit of a declining wedge right here for any traditional chartists"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1496200","1500200"," Trying to sell this back down right here, right? But this is more of a coiling action"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1500840","1504760"," Then it is declining, right? So this is not really a pennant or a"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1505240","1510200"," Um, any kind of traditional charting or whatever. This is more of a coil in the market to that coiling action going on"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1511000","1514280"," Right. So anytime we're down here, you're buying dips whenever we're up here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1514280","1520520"," You're selling rips and only if we break below these levels here are you becoming super bearish"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1521000","1525000"," And here's my point. This is how you get caught in the marketplace. I can get caught in the wrong spot"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1525720","1528840"," So this is kind of like a no trade zone right here, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1529160","1532280"," You can possibly if you get like let's say we come down here, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1532600","1534360"," We bled this down here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1534360","1538680"," And you leave a few runners on or you raise your stops and we sell down here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1539000","1541800"," You're still closing for profit. Does that make sense?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1542280","1544760"," You should actually be cruising for profit in here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1545720","1551160"," And or raising your stops in case it ricochets to the upside side side on you"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1551400","1557000"," But you can't really get bearish here is my point and you can't get bullish up here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1558360","1563320"," Right you can't get bullish up here until you actually break above and consolidate"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1564760","1567800"," To go higher. This is like your danger zone in here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1568360","1573800"," You could leave runners on if you wanted or raise your stops as we might squeeze above"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1574280","1577560"," Because you can get caught in a trap and get sent back down. Okay"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1578280","1585080"," And the same thing applies to in here. So if you are going to get bearish or bullish on the market"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1585960","1589960"," Right or major downside moves or major upside moves"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1590360","1594120"," If you're like hey cap on that bull and I think we're going to the moon"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1594600","1597240"," You better be fucking above the right there. Does that make sense?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1597800","1600280"," You need to be above right there to get your bull on"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1600680","1603160"," Otherwise, this is going to grind you to dust"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1603720","1608920"," You guys know who the goat is right. Tell me in the chat who the goat is not me. You guys know who he is"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1609880","1612760"," Right some of you got some people don't like him, but he has some very good"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1613240","1614520"," Points out there, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1614520","1617400"," He tells you never to get caught in here right never in the middle"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1617800","1621880"," Right so you're buying dips you're selling rips in here. If you're going to become super bearish"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1622360","1624360"," you need to see"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1624440","1626600"," price bleed down here and reject"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1627240","1633080"," And that's when you actually begin to get your blood and your rain down here. It's like straight down to this level"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1633800","1635800"," Uh to this 4,400"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1636280","1639160"," Okay, and nothing is holding this up either"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1639560","1643400"," There's like a glass floor here and this is kind of a glass floor as well"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1643960","1649480"," Not a whole ton of stuff holding this up right 71 million or I guess that you got a little bit of juice down here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1649480","1653000"," You got 71 million, but this is only 21 22 million down here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1653640","1656600"," Uh, so this is kind of a light floor right or glass floor right here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1656600","1659880"," And then you got a little bit of support down here at 45 15"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1660360","1665000"," If you're a bull right you see any kind of break of 45 15"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1665720","1667720"," Break and rejection above"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1668280","1673560"," That means the market's rolling over. Okay, so if you're a bear if you are a seller"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1675080","1679160"," You are you pretty much should just set you if you're a seller if you're a bear right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1680120","1685000"," You should be you should be setting a little alert on a line on spx"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1685800","1687800"," Currently at 45 15"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1688760","1693960"," You see a break of that 45 15 and then we start rejecting it to go back up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1694680","1696280"," Start getting bearish"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1696280","1699880"," Uh in for a pretty big bloodbath to the downside. Okay"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1700600","1702600"," Uh, so you remember that down here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1703320","1706440"," All right, so there you go right now range bound coiling"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1706520","1710680"," This is all coiling action for a larger move down the road"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1711240","1713880"," Uh on spx should be pretty simple"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1714280","1719320"," If you're if you're down here, right if you're till we make a break if you see any price action down here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1719640","1724440"," And we opened this morning down here. You should be buying that even if we had a little bit more blood"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1724920","1727880"," You should have been buying that open without a doubt down here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1728280","1734120"," Uh, and so we can go to the upside makes sense and then if we start peeking art peeking up here, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1734520","1738440"," You should be looking to sell this does that make sense even if it squeezes up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1739080","1741080"," you should be looking to sell this"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1741800","1743800"," with stops above"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1744040","1748120"," Until we have a until we have a proof that we're going to go higher from that point"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1748520","1752520"," Where we hold that upper part or we hold below this lower part down here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1753480","1755240"," All right next thing"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1755240","1758760"," We're going to go to uh, we're going to go to my screen one more time. We're going to look at the next"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1759800","1761800"," Uh next one here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1761880","1766280"," Now this is uh market is going to move pretty fast soon for a lot of traders"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1766280","1768280"," The best bet is going to be"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1768360","1773800"," Reacting after the move and not anticipating or chasing the move every time this happens"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1773800","1778280"," Even if you called it and wrote it the reversible will be quicker than you can close for profit"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1778920","1783320"," So this tech or this post right here. It goes straight back to this. Um,"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1783560","1786200"," Go go straight back to this trigger screen right here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1786760","1790600"," Okay, and what my point to you on that on that post is"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1792600","1795320"," That let's say we're let's say we're down. Let's say we're up here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1795880","1797400"," Okay"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1797400","1799800"," And you're like well, I'm going to sell that right there, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1799880","1802760"," And we start to actually break above and start squeezing"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1803080","1810280"," It's easier for you to if you're not a really great trader to let the squeeze happen and then wait for after and sell it"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1811000","1813720"," If the move comes down here, let's say, right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1814680","1819400"," You shouldn't be chasing this as a bear after it happens if you try to buy this to go to the upside"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1819960","1820840"," Okay"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1820840","1823640"," If we end up bleeding down here or something like that get underneath there"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1823640","1828520"," We blast down and you miss that trade you can always take the trade back up here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1828920","1832920"," Rather than getting caught down here and a good example of this would be"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1833560","1836760"," Uh, the gold gold is a fabulous example"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1837240","1842120"," You saw that uh that gold sell that you saw that big wick on gold, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1842520","1845960"," You could have been long gold watch that like you're like, whoo"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1846040","1848120"," We're going up there. I don't have any sells up there"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1848440","1852760"," And then you watch it immediately reversed and a huge short come into the market on gold"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1853240","1856120"," Uh, and that's what that post uh is in relation to"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1856600","1858920"," So if you're a bull and you're like we're going to force"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1859080","1861080"," We're going to get all-time highs or something"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1861160","1864680"," Make sure you set you if you're going to chase that make sure you set yourself"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1865080","1867080"," Uh a stop on the upside"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1867240","1871800"," Uh that gets that gets that pays you before it reverses through the downside"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1872200","1874680"," And the same thing is likely going to apply"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1875480","1882680"," Uh to any weakness and and spoons coming into next week. So I made another post here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1883160","1886680"," Uh, when I made another post I would put this uh put it back over here really quick"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1887880","1890680"," That I read that I that I reposted it's right here. It's this one"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1890680","1891720"," It says"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1891720","1898360"," Now we will have to suffer through two weeks of ping ponging as everyone fights over its consolidation or distribution"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1899000","1902040"," For the eventual roll down into the middle of december"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1902920","1906600"," Okay, so this is relevant to iwm"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1907080","1909560"," Uh spx and uh tech"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1910280","1915080"," Basically historically what we should have happen here is under performance"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1915880","1922520"," From the two major indexes of uh or the two risk on ish kind of indexes spx and ndx"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1922920","1925720"," Otherwise a ka uh nq or q's right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1926440","1930520"," While you'll see overperformance by iwm and small caps"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1931400","1934520"," Which we've experienced right for this week"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1935240","1937240"," Okay, so this week"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1937240","1943640"," Outperformance by small caps right you got small caps outperforming you got under performance by the other two indexes"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1943720","1947480"," That does not mean that uh ndx should go to fucking"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1948360","1951480"," Hell it doesn't mean that spi should go to hell either"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1951480","1958440"," It just means under performance while this other index over performs. We know that's a january effect"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1958520","1959320"," Right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1959320","1963880"," They're going to be culling uh tax loss harvesting, but then also running up a bunch tickers"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1964360","1968840"," Uh a bunch of tickers that have performed but haven't fully performed"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1969320","1973080"," Uh throughout the year. So you're just expecting over performance"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1973480","1977000"," So you would you would it would look like this if you were to have um"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1978040","1980040"," if you were to have"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1980920","1988040"," If you were to have let's say you have womb iwm right big move up pull back big move up pull back big move up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1988120","1989160"," right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1989160","1992200"," And let's say this was let's say this one right here was uh"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","1993800","2000360"," Was spy right you'd say and just a little bit right just a little pull back and just a little bit pull back"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2000760","2003080"," And just a little bit pull back does that make sense"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2003960","2008760"," So you're getting like more performance out of the side of um now here's the fascinating part"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2009400","2012440"," When we come into friday of this week"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2013400","2014440"," Right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2014440","2018120"," You should see you should also see tech even weaker slightly weaker"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2018840","2024840"," Now what if we get the role into the middle of the month on these two indexes guess who joins back in"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2025320","2027320"," iwm joins back in"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2027720","2035640"," And these three indexes will then roll together into next week. Does that make clear sense? Maybe using crayons for this"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2036120","2041000"," Um, so we're so you're you've got all these bears right. I can see the bears on on social media right now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2041000","2045960"," They're like fucking they want a bloodbath spy bloodbath spy bloodbath spy"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2046760","2053480"," It's not happening. Is it you're not going to see that outside's down move until iwm"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2054040","2057080"," joins in with both spoos and"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2057880","2062840"," spoos and cues and that those divergences are very common"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2063560","2070840"," Very common in the market. You can very very easily see you'll hear people out there say hey look"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2071000","2075400"," Small caps is turning up and the indexes are not following for like two three days"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2075720","2078040"," Hey small caps starting to roll down"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2078360","2082840"," Uh, and the other indexes are not following and then eventually they fall down fall with them"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2082920","2087800"," So there can be a day or two or three divergence and then you'll actually get"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2088280","2094440"," Uh them acting uh in the same in this uh together again. I should say it's a bad way to describe it"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2094520","2096680"," But you get in the point at least right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2097640","2101000"," Let's check this right. Oh, look at that nice squeeze going on. I missed that trade"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2101480","2106680"," I just missed that shit just now. So we'll see if we can catch get that now that here we get that on here now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2107240","2109240"," So next one here is this"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2109240","2111240"," So that's that that post right there"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2112040","2117160"," Uh, I reposted this one right here as well because it posted this on the 29th of november"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2117640","2119960"," Uh, this explains it better for you"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2122040","2125400"," And then i've got this one right here. This is s&p 500"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2126200","2128200"," Sellers want to close"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2129080","2132280"," Sellers want to uh close the door on bulls today"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2132760","2137960"," Hasn't happened yet. They need to defend a 27em a in a one hour in a four-hour chart"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2138520","2144920"," You're you're you're cute to watch that chart if they do close the door though expect acceleration to the downside"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2145320","2151000"," Into the weekend now. Here's the caveat banks are likely not done yet with small crappers iwm"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2151400","2155560"," Could see cues and spy hold on just a bit more right what's going on today?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2156360","2161400"," What's going on today? We've got spy and cues holding on a bit more right they ran apple up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2161800","2167320"," This morning right trying to try to capture as much gains as they possibly can out of that ticker, right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2167960","2169960"," No more as mcgally it says"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2169960","2176120"," Uh mcgally got says price action as a function of risk management monetization winners as year-end liquidity is drying up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2176520","2178520"," according to gold in the last systematic buyer"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2179080","2185240"," Uh buyers standing our corporates, but bibax will cease in five days until late january as the window"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2185720","2191000"," Uh is closing quickly while cta's will only be marginal buyers in all scenarios"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2191480","2193480"," So let's take a look right now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2193480","2198040"," Uh, we're gonna take a quick look on uh, we're gonna take a quick look on weebl right now"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","2205320","2209400"," This morning right and what can we what can we glean from this this morning?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2210200","2212200"," Right you had the cross"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2212200","2216120"," Before the open here. Do you see that bear cross right here, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2217240","2224360"," Right there. This is the this is the attempt from bears or from sellers to to have a major"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2225480","2230120"," Trend change to the downside right that could last for days"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2230680","2236280"," And what do we have happening right here an actual reversal to the upside on spy"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2236760","2243880"," So are we bearish here on spy? Let me ask you that question. The answer is no on an on an hourly basis"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2244520","2248920"," You can see the demand coming into the market here. See the demand coming in right here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2249240","2253080"," See the demand coming in right here. It's pretty fucking bullish right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2253640","2258520"," Uh to actually be a bear trap coming into this close right now. So"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","2271480","2278120"," Did you bring this up on your charts at home this morning to see if they were able to close that door?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2278440","2284840"," Because right now not only did they not close that door, but this is a bear trap into this close"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2285160","2287480"," That's what's happening right now. We're getting a bear trap"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2287880","2291560"," And sellers. I want to know if you're a seller right now. Do you see it?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2292120","2296200"," Because that's what's happening. You're watching a bear trap on an hourly basis"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2297400","2298920"," To the upside"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2298920","2302120"," It's happening right now right now as we speak"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","2411320","2417640"," Now your bear thesis should not start until uh until friday, uh historically"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2418120","2422600"," Uh, so you should see ping pong action into the rest of this week out performance by iwm"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2422840","2425400"," And then starting on friday you should be looking for"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2425960","2432440"," Some weakness in spoons and that weakness in spoons is not it's not what a lot of people are expecting"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","2479640","2482200"," I don't care, but I do want to show you this right here"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","2534840","2539400"," Uh, I know I thought Andy was getting to a fight with people on on online or whatever, but"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2539800","2542520"," Uh, I thought it was kind of funny that people were trying to mess with them"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2542840","2547160"," It's usually a running gag or joke. Uh, if you don't know this already, right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2548600","2554520"," If you don't know this already if we're if we're weak in the in the fall in the in the in early winter like heading into january first"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","2593560","2600280"," Uh, the holiday rally should like we should be at 460 and then we get our holiday rally to 480 right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2600920","2602920"," And I don't believe that that happens"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2603400","2609080"," Personally right as of right now or if we do race up there, it's going to be what I told you earlier, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","2609480","2613480"," Fast moves in the stock market. You could see a a major upside move"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","3123480","3128760"," How do I uh reconcile today's bear trap with your ability to get out of your put back spread next week so number one"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3129240","3134440"," Uh a ratio put back spread will close to the upside if I get trapped in that trade"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3134920","3138120"," It actually pays me about five to 15"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3138680","3141960"," Uh, if we make a giant move to the upside"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3142680","3147640"," Uh, if we make that move down into next week, i'll get paid that way as well"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3147720","3153560"," It's hard the only way that trade doesn't work for me is if we are flat into june"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3153800","3156760"," Uh, so if if i if i place that trade on like a"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3157320","3162680"," Clorox or i don't know like blood wise or something that just trade sideways for"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3163000","3165480"," For we like six three months sideways"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3165800","3170360"," Only once every uh quarter it goes up or down or something like that that would be a bad trade"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3170440","3175240"," But spy moves with volatility up and down so frequently that it's very difficult"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3175880","3180520"," Uh to not get a print on that trade. It's um, it's almost a free fucking trade a lot of uh"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3181160","3183320"," If you don't know about that trade a lot of um"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3184120","3186200"," A lot of theta gang trades that trade"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3186680","3188680"," Uh, they love that trade so"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3189160","3191880"," Uh, you can like leave them on the background"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3191960","3197080"," You can like close close some of your theta shit and just leave a structured trade that's very similar to it"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3197480","3199240"," Uh to to print for you. So"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3200040","3202920"," I love those trades. They're one of my favorite if I was a bear"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3203400","3209080"," I'd be fucking trading those all the time. Uh, that would be it's a no brainer, especially inspire our cues"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3209640","3214680"," Um, put back spreads rate back uh bearish ratio spreads. They're fucking phenomenal for bears"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3215800","3217800"," um"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3218280","3220280"," Uh"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3221240","3226760"," Uh, I might uh how much uh, as a matter of fact this put back spread that I have on right now is not that big"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3226760","3228760"," It's uh, let me check it right now. Hold up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3232840","3235560"," I've got four forties and four forties sixes"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3236280","3238280"," so four forties and four forties sixes"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3239080","3241080"," uh, I own two"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3241080","3244440"," I own two two four forties and I sold a four forty six p"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3245240","3248360"," Uh, so they're actually it's actually a very tight one normally it's really spread out"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3248440","3252680"," But uh, this one's pretty fucking tight. So uh, I should get paid either way"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3258680","3260680"," What else you guys got for me?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3261000","3263000"," um"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3263000","3268600"," How do I reconcile today's bear trap with your ability to get out of your put back spread even today's but uh even today's bear"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3268600","3272200"," Even today's bear trap. I don't expect out performance by cues"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3272680","3275800"," I don't expect out performance by uh sp y either"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3276200","3279960"," And I think we still roll down on friday. I think on friday would begin rolling down"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3280840","3284040"," Uh, you know the thing too. That's fascinating to who has that question"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3285240","3289240"," targeting nugget here's another thing man. It's been on my back of my mind that I haven't really discussed"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3289880","3291720"," um"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3291720","3297400"," I would really like to see spied uh bleed down into the rate decision"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3298120","3300920"," and not be quote unquote priced in um"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3301720","3303720"," If we don't get a rate hike"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3303720","3305880"," I would really like to see us sell down into that event"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3306200","3308280"," Uh, it looks right now. It looks like"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3308920","3313640"," It looks like this coiling action that's in you scut you were looking at the gamma profile earlier"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3313960","3318760"," And I was like that's a coil. That's not a um, that's not a fucking bear flag or a bull flag"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3319560","3325480"," If that coil should last uh for a pretty big decision in the market coming out on uh,"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3325560","3327560"," I believe tuesday is the 12th"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3328680","3336200"," So i'm not expecting like moonshot right now and that's the other part too is the um collar the jpm collar for end of the year"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3336520","3340200"," bothers the fuck out of me that jpm collar is bothering me"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3340280","3341640"," Uh"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3341640","3347240"," It's it's like a thorn in my side if I had any thorn in my side right now. It's it's uh probably that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3347960","3349160"," um"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3349160","3355240"," Do we like do we come back to it from like do we come from the upside down to it or do we come from the downside up to it?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3355720","3357640"," I think as a bull"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3357640","3360040"," My preference that might the truthfully"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3360920","3365560"," My preference would be that we um are lower into the 31st"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3366360","3369160"," And we trade up into it into the 31st"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3369800","3375160"," Uh for continuation up to 4,800 in january or march and i'll show you that right now too. Hold on"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3376920","3378920"," Let me show you uh"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3379080","3381080"," something really quick so"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3381880","3383880"," the collar"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3383960","3385160"," Uh"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3385160","3391880"," What's bothering me like how you guys explained you guys explain this to me. Okay. Oh, I'll ask you guys"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3392600","3398200"," Because I don't I haven't really asked anybody too much about this, but a lot of people know about this, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3401480","3403480"," So this is the jpm collar"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3404280","3410200"," And we end up having like magnets at the end of a collar see it right here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3411160","3416680"," See it right over here like the magnet they're like who says it really well is uh andy constant says it"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3417160","3421880"," He I think he calls it the vortex, right? He's like he's like the collar is a fucking vortex"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3422520","3426120"," He's like I don't give a fuck where price is he's like when we get into the end of the quarter"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3426520","3429160"," It's one of these strikes becomes a vortex"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3429880","3433240"," Right where it attracts us like a tractor beam towards it"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3434200","3436840"," So reconciling this right here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3437720","3441560"," All right, this is end of quarter. All right, you're gonna expect"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3442680","3448680"," But you're gonna expect us right now for price action to get sucked into this level. It's 45 15"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3449480","3454840"," Okay, so you're you're you're you have to pick one point. You know, you have to pick one poison or the other"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","3480120","3484760"," Let me ask you what your thoughts are on this especially bulls because that because I think there's a"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3485480","3487720"," Trap and thesis here for bulls"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3488600","3491720"," So let me ask you a question. This is the previous high right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3492600","3497000"," It's a previous high right there. Here's the other previous high. This is the one from 2020"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3498520","3500520"," One from uh, let's go a little bit lower"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3501240","3505800"," We got this one right here. We haven't even beat that one. We haven't beaten that one yet, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3507160","3509880"," We haven't beaten this one yet, right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3510920","3512920"," And this is the uh"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3512920","3517800"," Other one and this one up here would be an all-time higher. Let's say, okay"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3518920","3520920"," So let me ask you a question in here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3521880","3523880"," Okay, so these are all these previous"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3524280","3530280"," Uh previous garbage shit that we want to take out, right? This is the uh 29th. I believe 29th of December"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3531000","3535720"," And we know there's a magnet here. Okay. We know there's a magnet right here. So let's write that in"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3536440","3538440"," We've got a magnet right here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3538920","3540920"," Right you got a magnet?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3541800","3545080"," Magnet right for the 31st"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3547400","3551080"," This right here is the uh, let me say I make this just larger than I guess"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3551640","3557640"," That right there is your magnet, right? So let me ask you a question. You don't have a lot of time left, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3558200","3562200"," Uh, are you saying that we only get this one and come back down here?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3564040","3566040"," Are you saying that?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3566280","3570840"," Uh, we're gonna go up and just smash in on jape drone pal doesn't do anything"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3571000","3571880"," Right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3571880","3576200"," This looks like gold doesn't it and you just squeeze the fuck out of the market up here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3576280","3579480"," And then we blast down into the end of the year"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3580360","3582200"," That's your other option, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3582200","3585560"," And then we'll be the look what I think my best option is"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3586120","3588760"," Uh, we get we do this sideways stuff here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3589560","3591560"," blast down into"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3592680","3594600"," Uh, Jerome Powell right bloodbath"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3595320","3600120"," And then we actually make our way back up into the magnet and we have"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3600920","3605240"," Option into January and February and actually take this stuff out"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3606760","3610920"," Um, personally, I think this is the most logical"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3612840","3615720"," Uh, or the this is what I think will happen"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3617080","3619240"," Uh, I'm not against this happening over here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3619800","3625080"," Uh, but that would be a shocker to imagine coming into christmas or hanaka or festivus or"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3625720","3630040"," Um, you know, whatever it is that you you um, celebrate or whatever or nothing"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3631000","3634440"," This would be unusual right unusual traditionally for us to do this"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3636920","3641080"," And how often do we leave that behind how often do we do something where we break above"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3642920","3644920"," And do that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3645160","3646680"," rare"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3646680","3651320"," Like like you're talking like one out of uh 20 or 30"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3652600","3659080"," One out of 20 or 30 collars. We get action like that. So try to square this away with yourself"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3659800","3661800"," Uh heading into end of year"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3662920","3664920"," I I need you to do that because"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3666120","3669000"," Uh, there is I need you to square this away"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3669000","3672840"," Remember where vix is right now or remember like think about where vix is think about"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3673400","3676040"," Just think about this stuff into the end of the year"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3676040","3678040"," um"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3678680","3680680"," Like things that you know"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3681400","3683400"," A lot here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3683400","3686280"," Think about things that you know to be true"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3687080","3692520"," Like not guessing not uh more information not or no more information needed"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3692920","3696360"," Start thinking about things that you actually know into the end of the year"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3696760","3701560"," Know that there's a magnet down there at 45 15 and uh know that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3702360","3704360"," the likely path"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3704920","3708680"," Is probably a pullback for that run into uh q1"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3709560","3711560"," You"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3715000","3717720"," Uh, so think about that. I want you to think about that think about that like"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3718280","3723080"," Think about that magnet into the end of year and would you rather come up into it"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3723640","3729000"," You like you have a relief blow off right we not blow off, but let's say you have a relief where we blast down right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3729960","3734680"," Blast down in the uh decision-making process with drone pal. We go to the depths of hell"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3735080","3740840"," Think about this. All the bulls are fucking destroyed. All the bulls are crying. They're all trapped"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3740920","3742920"," They're scared. They're fucking you know"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3743080","3745720"," Oh crying and tears coming out of their eyes"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3746600","3751960"," And all it was was an opportunity for you to to buy a fucking destroyer of a dip"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3752440","3756600"," And just trade that shit up and just slam out all that shit on uh"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3757000","3760920"," January of 2022. I think about that right now. I don't know what's saying it's gonna happen. I'm saying"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3762040","3764520"," Uh, I think we're pulling the gun a little bit early"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3764680","3767560"," Pulling the trigger on the gun a little bit early that we're going to 4,800"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3770120","3772120"," You like happy drone"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3773880","3776760"," I just i'm i'm more fascinated by the mechanics of this"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3777480","3781560"," How it's going to how it's going to take place and what else can we derive from this?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3781640","3785320"," Right? So you you just saw this chart for you just saw this chart"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3785960","3791560"," Uh about the collar right now think back to the car that the chart I showed you"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3792200","3800280"," With the gamma profile right that that gamma profile that we have uh new call walls opening up at 4,750"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3801240","3804840"," But where do we need to be to chase that? So let's say we know where the collar is right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3805640","3807640"," If we go back to that gamma chart"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3808280","3810280"," That I showed you a moment ago"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3813160","3820200"," And you got me harping on you telling you, um, you got me saying to you. Well, which you know, you just you tell me where we're going, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3821160","3823800"," Uh, the one positive is that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3828360","3830360"," The one positive here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3830680","3832680"," So here's 4,700"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3832920","3834920"," There's 4,750 right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3836360","3838360"," Uh, the one positive is this"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3838680","3840920"," We know where gamma is we know that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3841640","3848520"," Uh, if it begins early right if we make that run to 4,800 before we get to the collar"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3849080","3851720"," On december 21st. What are we looking for?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3852680","3854680"," Price above right here, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3855160","3859560"," If we start coming up here and consolidating and it's only like monday of next week"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3860360","3864200"," I'm going to give it to the bulls to have a chance to go up there. So you got it's got i'm saying"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3864600","3869000"," So, uh, these are some knowns that we have in the market right now that can help us"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3869560","3874280"," Uh to find out uh or to get insight into which way it's actually going to go"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3874600","3877400"," Are we going to run up to that 4,600 the 4,800"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3877880","3879880"," Or at least 4,750"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3880200","3882920"," Uh before uh or during j pow"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3883320","3890760"," But let's say now into j pow or are we going to wait until uh, wait until um after the 31st"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","3895720","3899080"," Does that make sense to any guys out there my might they lose any of you guys on this"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","4388600","4392920"," It's like straight moonshot and then you don't close and it just reverses on you"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4393480","4396040"," Uh, but i'm not into that trade career low. I'm down for it brother"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4397000","4399000"," Uh, what else you got there"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4400920","4403640"," How much percentage move do you think of or down to profitable?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4404440","4406920"," Um, uh, normally when I trade zero dates"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4407560","4411480"," Let's say i buy them for 10 cents if I can get 20. I'm happy i can get like a hundred percent trade"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4411480","4413080"," I'm very very happy"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4413080","4416440"," Uh, but if you're skimming 30 percent 50 percent i'm happy with that too"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4416840","4420760"," Uh, if you're if you're green man, uh, just raise your stops and kiss comes back on you"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4421400","4423400"," Uh, remember that zero dates are directional only"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4423880","4427880"," I never hold zero dates all day long like as long as we're in that direction i'm happy with them"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4428280","4429560"," Uh"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4429560","4431560"," I tend not to uh, hold them"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4432760","4435160"," I tend not to hold them, uh for too long"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4440200","4445400"," Uh, rubener from namara, uh suggested put back spreads for january. I"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4445800","4448120"," I saw i've got mine for june dude. They were cheap"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4448440","4450920"," Uh, i got some good spreads for june. I was like fuck it"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4451640","4456760"," That 440 is like that 440. I would make a comment the other day with someone on twitter"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4457320","4459480"," And I was like dude that 440"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4459480","4466120"," 4400, uh, who the first person that coined it in my experience was, um,"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4467320","4469240"," Derek, uh"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4469240","4474120"," Derek trades, which is named Derek. Um, I forgot his last name is, uh,"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4474520","4476920"," Derek trades is what he does now, but"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4477640","4481720"," Way back in like 2020 or something or 2019"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4482520","4485320"," I don't know if it was I think it was 220 2020. I think it was"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4485880","4488040"," And we thought we were never going to see 440 again"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4488040","4491320"," We just kept going back to it and back to it and back to it and back to it"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4491960","4497160"," And sure then shit, it's been a level of interest now for, uh,"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4497560","4499560"," what three years"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4499560","4505800"," 440 so, uh, that's um, that's like a place of it's like a place that we magnet, uh,"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4507240","4509240"," What else we got there?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4509880","4514360"," If I had a gun to my head, uh, I need to put your money with gs or jpm, what would you choose?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4515720","4519560"," So if you guys follow me on, uh, at captain's alpha, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4522040","4531320"," Um, you guys probably you may or may not know that, uh, I have money with jpm. Okay, I have, um, uh, like retirement money and"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4532200","4534200"," And"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4535720","4543080"," Uh, some of you know that I get, uh, in or I get they send me, uh, newsletters and all kinds of other stupid shit"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4544840","4548360"," And I remember last, uh, october, um"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4549480","4553960"," There was like doom and gloom and then december came around and we were heading in a january"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4554760","4556760"," And I did a big long fucking post"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4557720","4560760"," Uh that I had posted a link to some of their letters"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4562120","4566840"," I feel like they tell you I feel like they tell you and right now. I feel like they tell like, um,"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4567800","4569800"," Bob on main street"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4570520","4574520"," So like those guys will come out and they'll tell you the doom and gloom"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4576120","4578120"," But if you have money with them"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4578200","4584760"," They're fucking spot on like they will come to you and be like, uh, hey for for 2024. I want you to buy x. Okay"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4585480","4589320"," Or for 2023 2024. I want you to sell, uh, xli"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4590120","4596040"," And they just like I don't know why they don't make that shit public. I don't know why there's, uh, two voices"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4597480","4599480"," But they do it. So"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4599480","4604760"," A lot of times that what they say publicly is not what they're telling their clients. Uh, that's the only way that I can describe it"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4605160","4611160"," So, um, I think they're really good at what they do, but it's not really what the news is"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4611720","4613720"," You"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4617160","4620120"," Yeah, so that's what I think about like so what I think is that, um"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4621080","4623960"," Are not just think but from my experience"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4625880","4628920"," They put the doom and gloom out there because they have to and they should"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4630120","4633800"," They should say like Jason saying hey, this is on the table for next year"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4634920","4640360"," Uh is responsible of him to say for where we are right now. So like for right now where we are"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4641000","4648920"," The information that he put out yesterday. I thought was responsible and is, uh, valid"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4649720","4653800"," If you watch this show yesterday at segment. I show you the monthly, uh"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4654680","4658840"," The monthly decline in velocity on the markets and historically"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4660280","4667800"," Uh, that does give a signal of the of those things to come down the road. So, um, I think price is going to matter though"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4668280","4673800"," Uh, with Jason is saying if we have a high enough price, I don't think the damage will be as low as 3500"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4673880","4675720"," But I do see what he's saying"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4675720","4682360"," Uh, and his thesis is spot on so and what we use here is what hedge funds use. So, um"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4683480","4685560"," It makes sense to me. What do you put out?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4685560","4687560"," I"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4691880","4697160"," Are we bullish on tesla my positioning of tesla is not changed in the slightest"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4697880","4703480"," Uh, I see a pullback on tesla, uh into next week and I think that's going to be the best buy for tesla"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4704440","4706440"," Uh, so i'm i'm waiting for that buy"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4706440","4708440"," So"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4711400","4717720"," Why would there be a bloodbath after joron powell, uh, i'm going to give you a few just a good question. So"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4719640","4723240"," Um, number one joron powell, right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4724600","4726600"," Even if he doesn't raise rates"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4728840","4735880"," If I was joron powell, he's in a corner right now. He's he's in the corner of all corners. I assure you of this he's in"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4736920","4741080"," Like he's like, uh, what's the movie there roadhouse? Uh, what do they say?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4741080","4744680"," Nobody puts uh, nobody puts baby in a corner. I think that was a saying, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4746040","4752440"," Uh, he doesn't want to be in a corner for anybody and, uh, I think from if I was joron powell"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4754040","4757080"," I would do a raise 25 vps"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4757880","4760440"," I would I would I would raise 25 vps"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4761320","4765400"," And I would do it not because I want to I would do it to buy myself time"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4765960","4768200"," Uh, I would buy myself another five or six months"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4769000","4773560"," Now two rate increases ago. I think I think it was two two ago. He said"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4773960","4775800"," Remember he broke it all the charts"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4775800","4781320"," And he broke it out of bullshit and I was fucking having a meltdown on the show and I was like, what the fuck is he doing?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4782200","4785560"," He's like, why is he doing this? This is so bad for his position"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4786280","4788920"," right and now we are here and"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4789720","4792120"," This is now paying off against him"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4792760","4797960"," Right now we've been through two rate decisions since that shit and sure enough. He's been backed into a corner"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4799160","4802040"," So the only way in my view for him to"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4802760","4805880"," Give himself some breathing room even if he doesn't raise again"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4806920","4808920"," Is to raise 25 vps"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4809400","4813560"," So I'm gonna warn you of that. Okay. If I was joron powell"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4813640","4819400"," I most certainly would raise 25 vps for the only reason of buying more time"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4819880","4823720"," Uh, another five six months to be able to raise again if if I need to"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4825560","4827400"," He knows"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4827400","4831320"," He fucking knows. Okay. I'm gonna assure you this. He knows that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4831960","4836440"," If he does not raise this cycle this decision if he does not raise, okay"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4837240","4840120"," the market will react as if"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4840840","4842840"," The rate hike cycle is over"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4843480","4845480"," And I don't think he wants that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4845960","4849960"," I think he wants to pause and hold as long as he can"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4850520","4854440"," And I don't think that he will or can do it with how the market will react to it"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4855160","4860440"," I think just like Jason. Thanks. You guys have heard me state this before if the rate cycle is over"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4861000","4863000"," Uh in price is not high enough"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4863560","4866920"," Uh, we will see that check back and and Jason is correct on that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4867000","4870120"," We will likely see that pullback all the way down to 3500"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4870600","4874680"," Uh next year and they will likely be forced to chase rate cuts"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4876120","4881640"," Into september of nek- uh start in september at the latest of next year"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4881640","4884440"," So think about that from Jerome's uh perspective"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4884840","4891320"," Does he want to cut rates in middle of net year next year or even potentially in the spring and summer of next year?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4891640","4893640"," I don't think so. I think he wants to"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4894360","4896360"," Hold as long as he possibly can"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4896680","4901000"," Uh, at least uh hold rates into next year. He's he stated that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4901640","4906200"," As such at this point and uh the mechanics of the market will likely trade against"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4906760","4908760"," His want to do to do that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4909640","4914840"," Uh into next year. So he's in a real predicament right now. He really is in my view. He's in a predicament"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4915400","4917080"," um now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4917080","4919080"," Saying all of that, right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4919800","4925080"," Uh, if he does raise 25 vps to get by himself that time"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4925960","4932040"," He has likely sealed the deal for a recession and possibly a really bad one"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4932360","4935160"," Um, so there's some there's some other such shit to that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4935720","4937720"," statement that I just made that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4937720","4940920"," Uh, he's likely sealing the deal to a to a major recession"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4941400","4945320"," Uh, as a matter of fact, you should be watching uh oil right now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4945560","4949240"," Uh, it's meant made a comment about that this morning. There was a bear on twitter that was like"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4949960","4954680"," Uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah rates or something and I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4955080","4957080"," You want to be watching fucking oil"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4957160","4960280"," Uh, because oil can be that uh, be that predictor as well"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4961480","4964040"," Uh of that happening and oil right now is"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4964680","4969400"," Uh, kind of showing that right that's still a possibility that we get the recession"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4975960","4977960"," Well, that's true too. So who said that?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4978120","4984760"," So kerlo just said uh, the pause might be the only way he can really buy time and then surprise hike to fuck all the front runners next"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4984760","4985560"," chair"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4985560","4988840"," Uh, so if so the concept here would be"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4989960","4994120"," The concept here is that if he does not raise in this cycle, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4994680","4997080"," Uh, this this decision. He does not raise"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","4997880","5001400"," Historically, we are done with rate hikes"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5003160","5006520"," If historically we're done with rate hikes, it would behoove"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5007480","5012280"," uh market participants to front run that's eventuality"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5013240","5017880"," Typically when we front run that eventuality, right? We will back check"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5018440","5020520"," Uh, from price where we are"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5021160","5025800"," Uh, and how that happens is if we were above the previous high from"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5026840","5031480"," Uh, 2022 january of 2022, right? We'd go back and back check that previous high"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5031880","5035400"," Possibly 4400 and 4000"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5036200","5040440"," Uh, if we fail to make a new high right now, right? We're not above"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5040520","5043640"," We're not above the previous high of january 2022 and we start back checking"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5044200","5048920"," We ain't back checking to 4400 and 4000. We're going to back check 3500"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5049640","5052360"," So, uh, he will be forced into that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5052680","5054520"," Uh, do you got a gear? I'm saying here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5055000","5057000"," Uh, he's going to be forced into"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5057240","5059720"," Uh, the market will force him into those rate cuts"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5060440","5064600"," Uh, because of the bloodbath coming so as we start blasting down on that 3500"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5065160","5066120"," Uh"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5066120","5068120"," And even if he does surprise rate hike"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5068200","5071160"," The market's already heading down way way way way down, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5071800","5074360"," Um, he won't be hiking. He'll be forced into cuts"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5075000","5077000"," So it kind of sucks"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5081240","5085000"," Uh, yellen is saying had headlines about high rates being no good"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5085400","5087320"," Do you think they will coordinate actions coming here?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5087320","5093400"," So, uh, that's the other thing, uh, so they're their vehicles right now are, um, 10 year yield, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5093480","5095480"," Or rate hikes, right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5095480","5097800"," That's what they're using for tools right now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5097880","5102360"," If the, uh, yield curve inversion is uninverting where if the 10 year is not going to pay them"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5102600","5105800"," Or not pay them, but I remove liquidity from the system"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5106280","5110200"," What, um, what vehicle do they have? So it's either rates"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5111400","5115640"," Uh, well, it's not just either rates or I'm kind of being dumb in this down"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5116280","5120040"," Like their vehicles are basically low rates or, uh, the 10 year, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5120520","5123320"," Uh, they have some other vehicles to taxation"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5123800","5125240"," Is one of them, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5125240","5127320"," Uh, that comes from the federal government's their state"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5127400","5130680"," Your local your county government city government stuff like that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5131400","5135320"," There's something else too that no one wants to there's a there's something else"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5135400","5140120"," Or there's two other parts to this that know what there's like, um, an elephant in the room that nobody's talking about"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5140840","5142280"," Um"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5142280","5147160"," Like you hear a lot of bears say things like, um, or hawks or bears say what about this and what about that?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5147160","5148280"," And what about this"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5148280","5151080"," There's two big elephants in the room one wages are coming up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5152200","5153080"," So"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5153080","5155720"," It could be like a modified we beat inflation"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5156680","5159240"," But because wages are coming up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5160120","5163480"," So they're like we're going to beat inflation. We're going to get underneath the rate of inflation, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5163480","5166120"," They are your rate of inflation. We're going to bring that to"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5166680","5168840"," 2% well, we might not have to"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5169880","5171880"," Because wages are coming up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5172120","5176440"," That though means that again, you're never going back and paying 99 cents for eggs"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5176680","5180760"," You're fucking your fucking hamburgers are all are going to be more expensive"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","5186920","5191560"," Um, so you got that to contend with and then the second problem going on right now is"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5192040","5194440"," Uh, people are repackaging their bad debt"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5195080","5197080"," Into these high rate loans"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5197080","5206520"," Uh, they're re-mortaging their homes for 8% and dumping the 20 and 30% bad debt in so you're extending the pain on uh, the consumer"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5207160","5210840"," Uh, but they can absorb for another two to three years at minimum"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5211560","5214920"," Uh, so I don't know what there's what there. I don't know what their"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","5234440","5238920"," Berger room and everybody can sense it. You can see it right see in the news you see it and been to it"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5239400","5244200"," You see it by very smart people discussing it, uh, that they have to cut rates all this kind of stuff"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5244840","5251240"," Uh, shit's probably already broken that kind of stuff. So I'm fascinated by this rate decision personally, uh, what he does"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5253160","5258280"," I think this is the most likely time you get a surprise rate increase if there was the most likely time"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5258680","5261800"," This is the one where it's very like our very very probable"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5262520","5268040"," Uh, if there was a surprise spray probable. This is the one where you get the surprise. He buys himself more time"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","5303240","5308760"," This market's already going to start fucking roll. I think it's going to grab some liquidity and start back checking, uh, lower levels"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5308920","5311000"," And the only real support we know that's for sure"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5311800","5313800"," Is 3500"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","5347400","5348920"," no rate hike"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","5348920","5350920"," and we could moon"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","6366200","6371240"," You want to see an example of why it was the worst it was ever was i'm going to show it to you right now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6372360","6377400"," Uh, the reason it became the worst uh incident was because they did not expect this right here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6378040","6380040"," this exact tag"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6380040","6382920"," You see that exact tag on that gray line right there, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6383560","6386680"," Uh, and this is very similar to what happened"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6387320","6394520"," Uh up here believe it or not in 2000 and 2008 because i'm going to go back and we're going to check 2000 in 2008 and why"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","6413240","6419080"," We had that break of this big gray line right here. This was uh, really fucking bad really fucking bad"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6419720","6424680"," Okay, if you're going to expect a great depression, you're going to expect us to break that gray line right there. Okay"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6425480","6427480"," That's a great depression right there"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6428040","6430040"," Just so you know"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6430040","6431480"," Uh"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6431480","6436520"," This is part of 1930. This is 2001 and 2008"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","6451720","6456680"," And you can see here the depths of hell right? This is the initial initiation of world war two, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6456680","6462520"," I was not right for world or two 1938. I was just getting ramped up and then we have uh 1942 right here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6464280","6468200"," And you can actually see when the soldiers come back home and the cessation of fighting right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6468200","6473800"," This is 1946 and the boomer years right here right boom rocket ship. Look at that"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","6499960","6502600"," Look at that big tag down here right on that blue line boom"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6503320","6505480"," Start moving right boom"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","6588840","6593480"," Is even that crash only put us down to the quarterly"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6594440","6599480"," Not so bad right not so bad never saw this prior low never saw this prior low"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6600360","6607240"," Never right never ever went back to revisit these lows on that run in 82 nor did we go back and visit these lows"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","6630120","6637000"," So if you're going to start think about probabilities, right? We have a lot of moments where we're tagging that blue line isn't it?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6637640","6639640"," Check that out"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6640840","6641960"," Right"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","6684120","6688840"," Right, so just imagine right now, right think about this if you're watching this stream with me right now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6688840","6690840"," I want to ask you a question"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6690840","6693640"," if you were if you were trading in 2008"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6694920","6696920"," with me"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","6704600","6706600"," Where the fuck is bottom?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6707720","6709720"," I could give you that couldn't I?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6709880","6714520"," I could we could slam into this this v shape recovery right here. Whoop straight up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6716040","6718040"," And I would say to you the worst that we're gonna get"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6720440","6724040"," Is that 7200 right? I would be lauded"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6725080","6729560"," as Jesus or some other fucking profit out there wouldn't I?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6730200","6732680"," Smartest fucking guy in the stock market"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6733240","6735800"," Time the bottom of the 2008 crash"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6737320","6739320"," Yes, who else does this"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6739320","6741320"," the fucking banks"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6741400","6744040"," They know where it's going beforehand"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6744920","6749880"," They plan this out over hundreds of years going back to the 1890s"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6751640","6756760"," So if I can look at the entire history of the stock market, I can say to myself right now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6757320","6761800"," I can take I can make a positive right now by 2008 right? What can I say about this?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6763480","6764280"," I"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6764280","6766520"," Can say if we have fraud in the market"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6767560","6769720"," Probably right down here is the worst that's gonna get"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6771560","6774600"," On average crashes should go no lower"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6775560","6777560"," than the purple line"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6777560","6783960"," Depending upon how how high we squeeze this should be the depth the worst case scenario, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6785720","6787720"," If we go to war world war three"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6788600","6794360"," If we have a depression that would be the only time that I would tell you that we could break through"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6799160","6803880"," The last band down here right only if we're in world war three"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6804920","6806760"," Only if we're in a depression"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6809000","6811000"," Makes sense"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6811080","6813080"," 200 years right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6813400","6820040"," About 200 maybe what is it 1890 the night? That's 100 there you got another fucking 10 or 12 10 or 20 years before it"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6820440","6823320"," And then we've got what uh, we got fucking another"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6824680","6830120"," 20 years so far. So I said 200 years. It's called 130 years. I'm a little a little exaggerating here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6831320","6833960"," Okay, so let's go let's continue on with history here, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6834840","6836840"," most crashes since 2008"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6838520","6840600"," Fairly steady right bam bam bam"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6841560","6844920"," This isn't even spx and spx would even come this low, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6846520","6849720"," I'll show you spx in a minute, but this is the covet crash, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6851880","6853880"," Almost the near pin strike"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6854920","6856280"," Right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6856280","6861160"," Pretty scary times. I remember in the base that we bounced right off that and we rocket ship chipped up, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6863400","6865560"," Now this is Dow Jones industrial average"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6866040","6870600"," Let's show this on spx so that you guys have more you guys don't trade Dow Jones. Let's look at spx"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6871480","6873560"," And see what it says same chart"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6876600","6880280"," Let's look back on uh the two on 2008 and 2000 again"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6886760","6888760"," All right, so here's uh 2000 right here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6889720","6891960"," And we have the tech bubble right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6892920","6894360"," Tech bubble"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6894360","6897400"," Could have called it right. We have now we have all this history to tell you"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6897800","6901160"," This is the worst you should expect from a tech bubble or something similar"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6903080","6908920"," Back here in 2008 we went down to this bottom gray line, right? This is the fraud"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6909560","6911560"," Right that we had right"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","6929080","6930120"," So"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6930120","6936760"," Let's look at where we are in our stock market right now. Someone's asking uh are all those all that ta is it is it worthless"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6938360","6940040"," So on spx"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6940040","6942200"," Almost a perfect pin strike down here, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6943800","6947400"," On that purple quarterly right so that quarterly trigger down here, right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6948120","6951000"," Expectation worst it can get during covid"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6953000","6956440"," Greatest trick that the uh fed ever pulled"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6958840","6961080"," Was buying time for the market"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6965240","6969080"," When we began the rollover in 2022 and we were coming down here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6970040","6972040"," We had a high risk"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6972520","6974760"," Of major downside didn't we"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6975720","6977880"," right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6977880","6979880"," Major risk of trading"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6981480","6983480"," 3000"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6983560","6985560"," When we started"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6985560","6987560"," January of 2022"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6987560","6990760"," The fed trades are sideways into right now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6991480","6993480"," And what has happened since then?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6994360","6997000"," Those levels have done nothing but come up, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","6998120","7001480"," Feds buying time so the damage isn't as worse, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7002280","7005720"," Not not having to see this again, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7007640","7009960"," We already know that tech bubble here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7010760","7012920"," Fraud here, right? We already know that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7014920","7018920"," You got jpm coming out and telling you worst case scenario"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7019640","7021800"," If we don't break that and this"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7023320","7025320"," Is 3500"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7026520","7030680"," Right what is a spx showing on that quarterly?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7032440","7035960"," 35 49 18 on spx right now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7037880","7040280"," So he's giving you the worst case scenario, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7040280","7044760"," He's telling you the guy from jpm's telling you well, you know if he fell this or he get it don't get up there"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7044760","7046600"," We start blasting down into the first year"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7047240","7050760"," That's your that's your bottom down there. He's not telling you"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7051640","7053960"," Yeah, you're gonna have a tech blow off"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7055400","7056280"," Right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7056280","7058360"," He's not telling you doom and gloom"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7058520","7061640"," Telling you the time has passed and even if there was doom and gloom"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7062040","7067400"," Even if there was doom and gloom the fed has bought you so much time that that doom and gloom has raised up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7068280","7070600"," Over the past year and a half way up here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7071320","7072280"," So"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7072280","7076360"," Let's say what let you say does ta really matter not matter that kind of stuff"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7077000","7078840"," I'll tell you this"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7078840","7082840"," If jpm is telling you that that would be the expected downside move"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7083480","7085480"," It's showing it right here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7085640","7087640"," So he has a he's a valid case"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7088280","7090280"," for the worst that it could be"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7090680","7092680"," unless we have some kind of"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7093320","7098440"," Just like apple goes bankrupt and google goes bankrupt and and vidya goes bankrupt"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7099800","7104040"," You know like amazon goes bankrupt they go they go in a fucking zero or something like that"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7104120","7107240"," Or you know like there's some kind of implosion or there's fraud"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7107880","7110360"," Which we do we've got some fraud right now with commercial real estate"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7111000","7113000"," But even if you had the fraud from commercial real estate"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7113960","7116280"," What's the expected downside move at worst?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7118680","7120680"," 22 38"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7120760","7122760"," That's what your your expectation would be"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7126280","7128680"," That's the worst and as a matter of fact"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7133000","7135000"," Let me turn this off here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7135560","7139560"," And as a matter of fact if you remember back when mike wilson and those guys are calling for 30"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7140040","7141560"," Excuse me here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7141560","7143880"," You guys you guys could actually look up when wilson"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7146200","7150120"," Was calling for this down here, right? Remember he was saying 3,000 3200"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7151880","7156920"," Right and then we're back in october december up here and look up what he was calling for up here 3500 right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7157800","7162360"," So you can actually see when those guys are saying this is the worst it can be"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7162520","7167480"," This is the worst that it can be they're actually giving you they're actually these guys are coming out"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7168040","7169480"," from the banks"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7169480","7173080"," And they're fucking they're fucking quoting this shit right here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7174200","7175880"," That's what they're quoting"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7175880","7178520"," So when they're like hey, this is the doom"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7179480","7182840"," Like it was last year year before 10 years ago five years ago"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7183400","7185400"," These fucking guys already know"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7185800","7187800"," Where they're gonna where their targets are"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7188440","7190200"," Even if they don't hit them they know where they are"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7192040","7196120"," So it's not fascinating to me to hear these guys come out right now and say yeah 3500"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7196120","7199480"," I'm like yeah, that's the fucking guys thinks we're gonna break down there and v-shape straight up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7201480","7204600"," They already know they fucking know before we go there"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7207080","7209080"," Isn't that crazy"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7209080","7211080"," Tell me tell me that's not crazy"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7211320","7218680"," Uh that they pretty much know if we roll and where these levels are if we break through them where the expected worst case scenario is"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7227080","7229320"," Uh, okay, so maybe maybe I not miss up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7229320","7230520"," Maybe I'm misunderstanding again"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7230520","7232680"," So I got not being told don't they understand my crush cap"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7232680","7234760"," I'm wondering if we if now that these trillions of dollars"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7235160","7238280"," But they printed our floating around in the system if there's no way we could possibly go back"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7238840","7239960"," uh to"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7239960","7241960"," $3,500"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7243160","7245160"," There's no way"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7245160","7247960"," I don't know if there's no way there's a lot of stuff we don't know"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7248600","7250600"," You have somebody someone die in office"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7251240","7254520"," You have a war start those happen every three to five years something tragic"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7255240","7259080"," And you see the market just blast down so uh technically I think we can go down there"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7259160","7263560"," I think there's a bunch of ways we can get down there regardless of the money that's uh sloshing around in the system"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7263560","7265560"," But yeah, I get your point"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7266440","7268440"," I do get your point"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7270600","7274920"," Uh, but the ta the ta is um, they're just buying time in my view"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7275640","7279800"," My I think the greatest trick ever pulled on us was not the money sloshing around the system"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7280280","7284440"," But was uh, the the sideways action the sideways action. I think is more"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7285080","7288840"," Uh conducive to your point than the money"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7289800","7291800"," sloshing around in the system"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7291880","7293880"," I think it has more to do with um"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7294680","7299640"," The bot the sideways actions in spx and dji a our market goes up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7299880","7302040"," It's gone up since fucking the 1800s"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7302760","7306840"," So, and I don't think the money matters. I think that they're they're they're making this side"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7306840","7310280"," They're pushing this mark or they've pushed this market sideways for so long"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7311000","7313000"," That the more that they do it the more um"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7313640","7318440"," The more time they buy for the damage that can be done. I think voker do look back in the 50s and 60s of us"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7318760","7322520"," Slowly grinding sideways and up was the same action. I don't think there's any difference to it"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7325800","7327400"," So like the ta out there"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7327400","7331480"," I might get what you're saying that we have to go up because of the money in the system and everything is cheap"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7331560","7333400"," I agree with that statement too"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7333400","7337080"," But the fact that we can't come back test those levels fuck. No, we can do that all day long"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7337160","7339160"," We we've done it all day long and historically"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7340040","7342040"," Um, so I don't think it matters"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7349080","7353320"," Uh, even if we fail to capture a new high throughout the end of this uh year one into q1"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7353480","7355480"," I only think that matters if um"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7356360","7362120"," Only thing that matters if the macro stuff lines up like unemployment's still cranking right now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7362200","7364200"," Unemployment's going to crank up into"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7365000","7366600"," December it should"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7366600","7368600"," Even if they try to retard it it should"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7368840","7371720"," So we start hitting that 6% they should start cutting rates"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7371800","7376680"," You'll start to see a flattening in the raising of rates in the lowering of the raising of rates. You should see inflation"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7377240","7383560"," Slam down on that 2.2 percent and that should like the unemployment right and inflation"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7384520","7391400"," Combined with uh, I guess the yield curve matters sometimes sometimes it doesn't but the truth is unemployment was going to matter the most"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7391960","7394120"," Uh, unemployment's going to matter the most and"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7394600","7399000"," Uh, no more rate increases a flattening of the rates and they'll start to chase with the rates on the downside"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7399160","7406920"," And you'll see inflation bounce off that 2.2 percent and start riding up and when that happens you should expect the fed to start"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7407240","7409240"," Uh, cutting rates historically, that's what happens"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7413800","7418840"," I think I think the idea here too, right is they're trying to manufacture saving"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7419800","7426760"," Uh pensions 401ks, uh, they don't necessarily have to produce but they're trying to save the destruction"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7427400","7429720"," Of middle america"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7429720","7435960"," Now by trading it sideways the longer they can trade the sideways the less damage that is done. That doesn't mean you're gonna like boom"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7436840","7442440"," Right your 401k might be a hundred thousand dollars and it might be a hundred thousand dollars in three years"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7442760","7445080"," But it's not going to be a hundred thousand dollars and you wake up"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7445720","7449800"," And it's fucking ten thousand dollars in three years. That's what they're attempting to do"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7450440","7452280"," Uh in the marketplace"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7452280","7454520"," Uh, so you might not experience any real real growth"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7455080","7458360"," Uh, if you're like an old person or something like that, you see the money"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7458680","7461000"," You saw the money leave the system for that reason, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7461400","7467560"," Saw people buying real estate. You saw people putting their money into treasury bills like you know, like people are scared of that, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7467640","7469640"," Older people not young people older people are"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7470200","7472200"," Because they're retarding the growth of wealth"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7472680","7476440"," Uh for these people you see the money like entering and exiting the system the past year"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7477080","7483480"," Uh, so that's that's insight of the sideways action in the stock market not like the stock market not overperforming"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7484520","7486680"," Uh these nest eggs that these old people have"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7490440","7494200"," I have something for you though. Uh, who who's the who's the who's gonna share that conversation"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7494280","7496120"," So I got something else cool for you real quick"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7496120","7499560"," I want to show you guys something else that was fascinating that I wanted to point out to you"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7500040","7503000"," If you wanted a reason for the market not to look back right now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7503560","7505640"," Um, there's one other thing I want to show you here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7507880","7512760"," And that is the um, something that I find fascinating for PE ratios"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7517640","7520120"," If you wanted to make a case"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7522680","7524680"," If you wanted to make a case"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7526200","7528200"," You know your boy gunlock there, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7528920","7530920"," And he came out"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7531240","7533240"," Remember you boy gunlock came out"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7533640","7535640"," Gonna hide that one went"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7535640","7537640"," That one actually went way up here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7540040","7545880"," Gunlock came out on CNBC back. I believe in um, I think it was February of this year"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7548120","7550120"," Yeah, I was right in here you ready for this"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7550680","7554360"," Gunlock came out. I don't don't pull me on this but I think in February"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7555160","7557720"," Gunlock came out on uh CNBC and he said"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7558840","7562040"," He said he said uh PE ratios are too high"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7563560","7566520"," And I was like fucking gunlock's been buying this shit down here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7567080","7571880"," Since the 19th late late 1970s late 1980s, right? It's for PE ratios"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7573400","7575240"," Right"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7575240","7581160"," And look at this he's rich fucks been buying this since since the late 1978 or so, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7581240","7587400"," This is what 80 is 79. I said I said 78, but even here this is 76 right here. They bought this one"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7587880","7590440"," They bought that one right there, right? And check this out"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7591080","7593080"," And I'm buying this shit"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7593320","7595320"," Like nobody's business, right?"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7595320","7597880"," Bought it down here again bought it down here again"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7598360","7601800"," Bought it down here again. These are the guys out there right that tell you"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7602280","7608120"," These are the assholes on CNBC that are billionaires and they tell you they talk out of their molds to you"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7608840","7610840"," And they're like they're like"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7611800","7615720"," But in reality what they're doing is they're fucking buying and you're chasing down the road"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7616520","7618360"," And you can see this last one right here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7620360","7622360"," Look what they did right here"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7624840","7627080"," They bought the fuck out of this didn't they"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7628440","7632840"," They they were buying this you ready for this they were buying this in may"

"GcqTWLzk_xA","7649400","7652200"," They ran this fucker up and look what else is happening right now"
"GcqTWLzk_xA","7653000","7655000"," They're buying it again"
