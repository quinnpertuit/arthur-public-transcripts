"QV7Ooh7RY0M","0","7000"," You're back."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","7000","8000"," No."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","8000","10000"," You've never met the person standing before you."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","10000","11000"," What?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","11000","12000"," Jason is not back."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","12000","16000"," I, a new man, am arriving here for the first time."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","16000","17000"," Cool."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","17000","20000"," So, how was Burning Man?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","20000","23000"," How was Burning Man?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","23000","28000"," What's wrong?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","28000","30000"," Good morning, traders."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","30000","32000"," Captain Jim James here with your daily brief."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","32000","36000"," I know that you've all been patiently waiting for one of these."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","36000","40000"," I've been gone west on a trip that I took for Labor Day the week"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","40000","45000"," and I just got back without having slept for many hours."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","45000","47000"," I would actually not it off."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","47000","49000"," I don't know, maybe 6 a.m. or so."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","49000","52000"," And my brain woke me up at like eight."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","52000","57000"," So I quickly opened my eyes and then I did a quick chart for Spy"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","57000","61000"," so that I could try to do some day trading yesterday and just sit high on Twitter."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","61000","64000"," And most of you folks said high back, which was really cool."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","64000","70000"," But I hadn't really had a chance to do any research or anything while I was gone."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","70000","71000"," But I did."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","71000","74000"," My last video that I made for you all, I said a few things to you."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","74000","79000"," First, I talked about closing all of your lungs, which you should have been able to do."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","79000","82000"," That would have been two weeks to one week ago."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","82000","84000"," Played the market that's in front of you."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","84000","88000"," But to also expect, you know, for us seasonally to start to head down."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","88000","96000"," We also talked about IWM heading down first and then for the Spy and NASDAQ to follow."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","96000","104000"," And to actually find some support in IWM or the RUT sooner than you would in NQ and Spy, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","104000","106000"," ES over time."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","106000","109000"," And those things seems like they're still playing out."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","109000","117000"," It's kind of ironic because I was looking for I think 4.53 and I got it right before I left."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","117000","121000"," And then it was at 4.53 or around there I think on Friday."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","121000","123000"," So nothing really changed."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","123000","128000"," It was more about rotation trying to find a way to start to get short in this market."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","128000","135000"," And to rotate into stocks that we've already talked about ad nauseam about going up,"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","135000","138000"," even though the market's starting to slightly roll over."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","138000","140000"," Or at least seasonally roll over."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","140000","144000"," So you had Tesla outperform yesterday."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","144000","147000"," You had Apple outperform yesterday."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","147000","151000"," I think two weeks ago I told you this would happen."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","151000","154000"," And that's what you really want to be focused on."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","154000","158000"," We're going to take a look here in a minute at the ES chart."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","158000","166000"," And it's really easy for let's say a bull in springtime to say the market's going up."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","166000","168000"," That's not really rocket science."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","168000","177000"," And it really isn't rocket science for a bear to say, hey look I told you the market's going down in September or October."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","177000","183000"," What you really need to understand about seasonal changes is the nuances in them."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","183000","193000"," So when you see let's say had you shorted Apple Friday into Tuesday you'd be toast."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","193000","194000"," And we already talked about that."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","194000","200000"," Some of these stocks are going to continue to go up even though seasonally we'll start to go down."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","200000","202000"," We talked about Tesla too."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","202000","205000"," And those are two specific ones that we nailed in the head."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","205000","211000"," And I'm sure that these these fucking bears probably thought they were going down."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","211000","218000"," So you really want to pay attention to individual stocks from now into December."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","218000","223000"," That will continue to go up even if the market trends downward right."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","223000","225000"," And you can still play those."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","225000","229000"," Another good one would have been Airbnb performed stellar yesterday."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","229000","233000"," And we talked about how when I talked about where the bull trap was."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","233000","236000"," I said it was much higher and it is much higher."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","236000","237000"," It has become much higher."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","237000","239000"," You can see Apple showed much higher."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","239000","244000"," You can see Tesla did and actually a bunch of the Fangmans were popping off yesterday as well."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","244000","249000"," And they were trying to grab of course liquidity for the market to go down."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","249000","256000"," But also to close out positions at these banks and the funds and institutions are in that profit."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","256000","258000"," And which is what they're beginning to do."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","258000","262000"," Even when the market is going to seasonally go down they've made the money they need to make."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","262000","265000"," The dent into those stocks won't be as bad."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","265000","271000"," And some of them will actually tend to continue to go up as they move forward into winter."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","271000","277000"," Now one of the things to think about is the bearish stance right now."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","277000","282000"," And the Armageddon stance and the markets going to crash once more."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","282000","293000"," I have in the past drank that Kool-Aid and I can promise you can lose lots of money falling into that thought process."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","293000","301000"," The only time in my career trading that I've been successful was having a bullish outlook most of the time."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","301000","310000"," Even if we go down quarter after quarter let's say or over the course of a year there are many opportunities as a bull to play the bull side."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","310000","320000"," You know and actually yesterday on Monday I was looking at the premium on puts and outside of playing breads of some kind or some sort of theta play."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","320000","329000"," There really wasn't a lot of there's not really a lot of money in it 300 to make 300% on a position that you have to hold for three, four, five days."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","329000","332000"," I'm not really interested unless it's protected spread."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","332000","336000"," I'm not interested in just holding puts for a week or a month."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","336000","339000"," Anything like that for the premium that you have to pay."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","339000","348000"," And if anything I can make more money on the bull side of these plays as there's no premium every time that we bounce back just day trading."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","348000","353000"," But that doesn't mean that I don't buy put spreads I do buy them about some yesterday."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","353000","362000"," In that middle of the day kind there was a moment in the middle of the day yesterday where there was some shifting in sentiment."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","362000","368000"," So is that actually able to grab to I guess you'd call it sellin' a rip."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","368000","369000"," Sorry I'm drinking my copy here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","369000","377000"," I just woke up actually was gonna buy some calls yesterday into clothes and fell asleep and sucked all through the night as it just hit me like a brick wall."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","377000","381000"," Coming back my throat's a little dry as well as you can probably tell."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","381000","384000"," There was smoke and dust everywhere."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","384000","391000"," So just getting back to what you need to be thinking about right now is you're gonna have news events."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","391000","397000"," There are going to be your economic calendar news events are going to trigger downward pressure."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","397000","401000"," It's not going to go straight down no matter what anybody tells you."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","401000","403000"," I am not sold."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","403000","412000"," And there are no indicators that say that we are going down into a recession or market crash or anything like that."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","412000","418000"," And I wouldn't play those I wouldn't play that perspective unless we were to prove that either."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","418000","423000"," And that would take a substantial downturn over a long period of time."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","423000","428000"," You're talking about some time into next year for me to get that bearish."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","428000","433000"," Keep that in mind as we move forward from now into winter so that you can stay nimble."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","433000","437000"," Get bullish when you need to get bullish and not drink that bear Kool-Aid."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","437000","442000"," It is the surefire way for you to blow your account to become bearish."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","442000","451000"," And if you have to you ignore these people the snark and all of these I told you so they really aren't."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","451000","456000"," I'm going to show you here why here in just a second because we've already talked about this as bulls."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","456000","460000"," We've been discussing this for weeks ad nauseam."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","460000","465000"," So none of us should have gotten caught in this downward movement that we took on Tuesday."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","465000","467000"," So today we do have the beige book."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","467000","471000"," We've got job openings at 10 beige book at two consumer credit at three."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","471000","479000"," I think we have some some fed chairman you know sitting on a bridge like trolls today at some point later in the day."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","480000","484000"," And then Thursday we've got initial jobless claims and then continuing claims."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","484000","487000"," Those are important for some downward moves."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","487000","491000"," I do think today we might have a we might recover slightly today."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","491000","493000"," So we'll take a look at that as well."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","493000","495000"," For where the economic calendar is."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","495000","497000"," In Friday we've got PPI."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","497000","499000"," We've got wholesaler matrices through vision."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","499000","507000"," I will start to pay less slightly less attention to the economic calendar as we move forward and rely mostly on my chance for where we are."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","507000","516000"," Where when we're going up when we're going down most of the news right now will be used as catalysts to drop the market or raise the market."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","516000","522000"," And you're more or less going to need to start comparing the economic news that you are going to see."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","522000","532000"," You're also going to compare the bullshit news that has dropped into the market for you to consume and always check that against where we are in the chart."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","532000","537000"," I posted yesterday about Coinbase coin the stock going down yesterday."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","537000","546000"," And we've been playing coin which is funny because I heard that the web I think I read that the website was down or something."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","546000","556000"," It's funny because it was right at where resistance is right where you should be selling the manipulation in the market is it never ceases to amaze me."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","556000","561000"," It's mostly why I tend not to listen to market news too closely or too in depth."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","561000","565000"," I use it as an indicator that yes it was time to sell."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","565000","571000"," But I do pay attention to it when it's something that's unknown for its immediate effect on the market."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","571000","575000"," Those are the things where there's usually lots of opportunity to make money."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","575000","581000"," Where it's something where we didn't know no one else knew this wasn't something planned behind the scenes."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","581000","587000"," So we're going to take a look real quick at ES. We're just going to talk about we're going to talk about seasonally right."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","587000","593000"," We've already talked about seasonally that the market should start to pull back."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","593000","601000"," We talk about this seasonality and you hear a bear that talks like they found the Holy Grail or something in reality they didn't."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","601000","607000"," You can see here this is September 3rd of 2020 and we made our way down."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","607000","617000"," You'll probably see bears post some kind of a chart with this downward move into the 11th or 15th and then a spike up and then another spike down."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","617000","624000"," They were literally stale these charts from just last year and say expect this here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","624000","627000"," They won't tell you about this here in October how we come back."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","627000","635000"," This right here is a huge move in October of 2020 and then we come back down into the soft ones more in late October."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","635000","640000"," And you'll see that into December we have a nice holiday rally in here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","640000","644000"," So this is seasonally what happens in September and October."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","644000","646000"," None of this is rocket science."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","646000","650000"," It happens every year, not every year but most years."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","650000","654000"," We can look at in 2019."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","654000","656000"," We have the same thing."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","656000","662000"," We have this move up here in early September and then we have a move down from the middle of September I believe."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","662000","667000"," 12th it starts to roll over down into the first week of October."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","667000","679000"," But we do make this big huge move up here into January and the 2019 2020 is usually how it goes this time of year."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","679000","688000"," You have seasonally downtime in September October and then November parts of October and parts of November can be a toss up."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","688000","693000"," It can actually get very bullish in here or it can be bearish once more."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","693000","699000"," This is where things will get tricky for us this year is mostly October and November."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","699000","704000"," Do we get a later holiday rally or do we just rally straight through October?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","704000","707000"," And you can see here this is October 7th."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","707000","717000"," And if you go back even into we can look back into 2018 here and you'll see this is we continue to rally up into September into October 1st"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","717000","721000"," and then we had a huge sell off into December."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","721000","723000"," We got no holiday rally here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","723000","731000"," So you can see that no one's really going to predict what's going to happen coming into the fall and winter."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","731000","737000"," Although there are expectations from your previous year that will follow that same trend."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","737000","743000"," And this is what leads me to let you know that you have to be nimble in how you're trading."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","743000","756000"," When you look at 2018, 2019 and 2020, all three years were different and gave you three basic setups for the fall and winter."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","756000","761000"," So any bear that's telling you how this is going to play out they don't know what they're talking about."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","761000","765000"," Any bullet tells you how it's going to play out."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","765000","767000"," They don't know what they're talking about."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","767000","779000"," You can say though that seasonally we are starting we are going to start to go down right that typically we tend to sell off in September, October at least."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","779000","782000"," Parts of October, November are toss up."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","782000","785000"," So we were anticipating this this selling down."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","785000","787000"," The question is how much do we sell down."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","787000","789000"," How far do we sell down."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","789000","795000"," And do we recover and how much do we recover right does that take place all through winter."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","795000","798000"," And then we will also want to talk about individual stocks."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","798000","801000"," How far up do they go how long do they go up."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","801000","806000"," The thing you want to consider about individual stocks as we move forward through the fall and winter."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","806000","812000"," Is you want to be looking for stocks that have been beaten down since February."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","812000","819000"," Some time in February if you look at if you if you find that your stock was beaten down all year long."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","820000","823000"," There is a fair chance that it is going to go up."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","823000","829000"," Even if it has minor pullbacks from now until December you will find that those stocks."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","829000","832000"," Those individual stocks will go up through December."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","832000","836000"," That happens every single year pay attention to those."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","836000","844000"," I think I've shown you on Finviz in the past videos how to search stocks there below their 200 ma."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","845000","849000"," That I've hit their 200s if you see a stocks that have hit their 200s right."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","849000","852000"," A 200a ma's or just recovering from the 200a ma's."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","852000","856000"," Maybe they've been up past few weeks of the past few months."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","856000","858000"," You'll see those continue to go up."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","858000","861000"," That's why we were able to predict Tesla going up."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","861000","865000"," That's why we were able to predict that Apple would continue to go up."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","865000","872000"," These aren't any insights that I make from anything other than looking at their charts."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","872000","877000"," We called the same thing on Airbnb and many other stocks where we said,"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","877000","881000"," hey, look, this stock has gone down all year long for an entire year."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","881000","886000"," When you see a stock go down for a year you want to start to see if there's any life in it."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","886000","891000"," Unless a stock goes down longer than a year typically there's something wrong with the company."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","891000","893000"," They're not in favor anymore."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","893000","900000"," They haven't introduced any kind of new technology or services that we're unaware of."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","900000","903000"," We're able to look back here on ES."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","903000","908000"," We know that seasonally we tend to go down from this period into October."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","908000","913000"," We know that it's a little bit more of a toss-up in October through November and December."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","913000","921000"," We also know that we sometimes don't get a holiday rally depending upon how strong September and October is."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","921000","929000"," If we do start to sell down from now into October we know that we can start to get nice and long,"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","929000","933000"," preferably typically in November."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","933000","942000"," We're going to get a little bit closer here on ES now and start to take a look at where we think it's going to go."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","942000","946000"," I tried to delete a few minutes ago."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","946000","952000"," I'm going to get rid of this VU out here because we really don't need to see that."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","952000","955000"," This is perfect right here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","955000","957000"," This is really what you want to see."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","957000","959000"," I really don't care what futures are."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","959000","961000"," I think this is, yeah, it's 401."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","961000","964000"," I really have no concerns where futures are."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","964000","965000"," You really want to see..."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","965000","968000"," I think this is where I left somewhere in here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","968000","969000"," I think it was the 30th."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","969000","971000"," It was like a week ago."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","971000","977000"," What you really want to be looking for is people are starting to call this megaphone pattern."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","977000","981000"," This expanding wedge it's also known as."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","981000","986000"," You want to start tagging these things"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","986000","988000"," down here, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","988000","997000"," You want to start taking a look at where these start or begin to form."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","997000","1001000"," I'm going to take this auto off here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1001000","1008000"," Looks bad in this."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1008000","1014000"," Really want to start playing these things out."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1014000","1016000"," We're going to go a little bit farther back."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1016000","1018000"," We're going to go back to the one year real quick."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1018000","1023000"," We're going to auto this."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1023000","1024000"," We've drawn these lines."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1024000","1026000"," I don't know how many times."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1026000","1031000"," I think we've drawn them multiple multiple times."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1031000","1038000"," I think it's fine that we continue to draw them."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1038000","1043000"," Let's do this one down here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1043000","1048000"," Bring this a little farther back."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1048000","1053000"," We'll do..."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1053000","1057000"," Get this somewhere right down in here, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1057000","1060000"," A little bit closer so that we can do this work."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1060000","1065000"," You should be able to start doing some of this work yourself over time as well."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1065000","1072000"," This is how you become free of listening to the noise."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1072000","1086000"," This is where you stop listening to people and you start making your own trading decisions."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1086000","1093000"," We can put one more down here in case the doom and gloomers want to get crazy."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1102000","1110000"," That one right there."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1110000","1112000"," You can see this here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1112000","1116000"," You can see that whenever we touch down here, you can actually see some support up here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1116000","1121000"," We can put one more above, but it's not really relevant to what we're doing right now."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1121000","1128000"," You just want to know where levels that we find support so we always know when to be buying dips, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1128000","1131000"," We always want to know where the real bottom is."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1131000","1134000"," It's probably down here somewhere."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1134000","1137000"," We're going to bring it back down to this closer level."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1137000","1142000"," You can start to see where support levels are, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1142000","1146000"," You can start to see where this is coming."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1146000","1152000"," You could even extend this if you wanted to, but I don't actually see this happening."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1152000","1156000"," I'm not going to tell you that that's going to happen."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1157000","1162000"," I doubt that it happens that we get below this level here and it goes up every day."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1162000","1167000"," I'm assuming at some point this week, it'll be 4400, 4447."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1167000","1171000"," There are some other levels, some hard supports you can put in here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1171000","1175000"," Now that you have this, you have these major supports drawn in."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1175000","1185000"," You can start to look for some other areas of support below."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1185000","1188000"," You can see that we sold down."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1188000","1190000"," There was hard support here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1190000","1197000"," You can also look farther back even and add some of these major supports in."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1197000","1200000"," It's probably going to be somewhere in here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1200000","1208000"," There'll be one."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1208000","1214000"," There'll be one somewhere in here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1215000","1220000"," There's the doom and gloom for bears, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1220000","1227000"," You've got some bears that are set calling for somewhere even farther down here, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1227000","1230000"," I'm sure there are some bears out there."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1230000","1235000"," Some real Kool-Aid drinkers that are talking about 413, probably higher."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1235000","1239000"," It's probably like 416."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1239000","1243000"," You could possibly put one more even lower, make it just a zone, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1243000","1247000"," Where to zone or get by?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1247000","1256000"," You can start to get an idea of where we're headed here, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1256000","1268000"," Start to see where you're looking for."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1268000","1272000"," You'd be surprised when you see this line that I have here, this upper resistance."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1272000","1278000"," You would be shocked if we broke free and actually made a huge move up this way."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1278000","1281000"," You could draw another one if you wanted to."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1281000","1287000"," Especially if you're a bear, you can draw one of these."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1287000","1295000"," Something a bit more if you're really bearish heading into October, let's say."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1295000","1297000"," This is October 1st."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1297000","1298000"," Here you can see this."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1298000","1304000"," Maybe we take this second run down to this 4376 in October."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1304000","1312000"," This wouldn't surprise me to see something like this take place."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1312000","1317000"," Something like this, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1317000","1323000"," Recovery up, recovery down."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1323000","1325000"," This move down into mid-October."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1325000","1327000"," None of that surprises me."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1327000","1328000"," That's a nasty looking line."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1328000","1331000"," It could probably go something more like this."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1331000","1334000"," Something in this vicinity makes more sense, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1334000","1341000"," If you were to drop through here today, if you were to drop through here and then come up, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1341000","1345000"," Kind of that same pattern you're looking for."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1345000","1352000"," Let's see if we can change that color."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1352000","1356000"," You can see two different options for how we come down."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1356000","1361000"," You can see that whenever you want to sell these rips, it's up above here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1361000","1367000"," You can use this line here or even this line above to sell your rips."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1367000","1375000"," You can also start to use some support lines for where you're buying support levels."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1375000","1380000"," I'm going to look for somewhere in here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1380000","1387000"," This is kind of neat how this works itself out."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1387000","1394000"," You can see this nice bearish triangle forming over here for an October dump."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1394000","1396000"," We'll come down in a smaller."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1396000","1398000"," I'm going to delete these right here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1398000","1402000"," You can see those for the spy."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1402000","1405000"," You're probably wondering how do I play today, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1405000","1407000"," You really want to know how do I play today."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1407000","1414000"," We're going to get it closer."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1414000","1416000"," We start to make some sense here, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1416000","1423000"," We're just going to start looking for support and resistance somewhere in there."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1433000","1435000"," I'll play this chart today."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1435000","1438000"," I'll end up playing this chart on spy."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1438000","1444000"," I'll transfer this information over to the spy so that I can have more."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1444000","1447000"," Let me see if I can get rid of that."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1447000","1450000"," I end up transferring information like this over onto spy."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1450000","1454000"," I think I already have it done so that I can start to make my moves for the day, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1454000","1456000"," I'm going to day trade today."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1456000","1460000"," I'm going to look for some firm support here, $44.98.50."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1460000","1464000"," If we break through, this should be minor support at $44.63."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1464000","1466000"," And then hard support."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1466000","1470000"," We can change the color of this because I think that this is hard support."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1470000","1474000"," Somewhere down here at $44.25."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1474000","1477000"," I'll buy this dip all day long."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1477000","1484000"," And to be honest, until I see, I would like to see this move down sooner than later."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1484000","1489000"," But if we don't get this move down, they're going to see us make this move up."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1489000","1490000"," Up here, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1490000","1493000"," Or even more for more liquidity grab up here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1493000","1497000"," So again, we've got $45.98."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1497000","1501000"," We've got $45.56."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1501000","1503000"," $45.40."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1503000","1506000"," $75.45.24."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1506000","1508000"," $45.02."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1508000","1510000"," This is as deep as I see us going today."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1510000","1514000"," We might play in this range and look for some liquidity grab above."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1514000","1518000"," And then for the rest of the week heading into Thursday and Friday."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1519000","1521000"," Look for $44.63."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1521000","1524000"," Or even $44.21."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1524000","1528000"," Anytime I can play the both side in here, I will."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1528000","1531000"," Then we're going to move on to which we look at next."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1531000","1535000"," Let's look at NQ."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1535000","1540000"," Which is NDX, NASDAQ, the Qs."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1540000","1542000"," We'll do auto on this one."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1542000","1544000"," And we're looking for that same kind of a pattern, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1544000","1546000"," How do we chart out NQ?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1546000","1548000"," And we already kind of know how to do this."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1548000","1567000"," We've done this many times now."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1567000","1575000"," We know that NQ can fall much farther because of the numbers, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1576000","1587000"," See if we can make this white."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1587000","1591000"," See another one right here?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1591000","1596000"," And we can do another one down below."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1605000","1618000"," Right here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1618000","1623000"," And then we know that we can put some."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1623000","1634000"," By zones in right."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1634000","1639000"," Probably have one hiding out up here somewhere."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1664000","1686000"," We know we have to count the bears in, don't we?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1686000","1689000"," Right in here somewhere."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1689000","1693000"," We have some firm support down at 13, 949."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1693000","1698000"," We've got 14, 530, 14, 830 down here below."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1698000","1710000"," And if we're going to play NQ for NASDAQ."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1710000","1719000"," We know we have some by the dip opportunities here at 15, 580."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1720000","1727000"," We know that we have a giant gap here that needs to be filled right, at least down to this level here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1727000","1733000"," This is probably going to be the price target somewhere in here between now."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1733000","1736000"," I think this is showing."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1736000","1739000"," October 7th."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1739000","1743000"," But I would expect that we come down much, much sooner."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1743000","1752000"," My price target from now until September 15th is going to be 15, 298 somewhere in here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1752000","1756000"," You could possibly go a little bit deeper."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1756000","1761000"," Down into this area. This is where you're going to find hard, hard support."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1761000","1767000"," Until we get into October somewhere in this vicinity right here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1767000","1771000"," You're going to be looking for us for some firm support in here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1771000","1774000"," Possibly for another move up into October."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1774000","1780000"," And then a deeper move down into, it's either going to be in October."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1780000","1786000"," Or we'll see that move extend into December down to 15 or 14, 530."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1786000","1790000"," So we'll play this as we see it as we move forward."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1790000","1804000"," You can also look from a bullish perspective."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1804000","1806000"," A range expansion in here, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1806000","1809000"," We bounce around in here until it starts to break through."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1809000","1817000"," You'll start to see."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1817000","1823000"," Now you will find some form of support down here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1823000","1830000"," See if we can."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1830000","1836000"," Firm this up a little bit."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1836000","1840000"," Now until we come down or drop down below."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1840000","1846000"," As that gets going to be challenging to find out where this expanding wedge actually is."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1846000","1850000"," You'll find some support probably on this line down here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1850000","1852000"," Somewhere down here or somewhere down here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1852000","1859000"," And then we can firm this line up to where actual support is and how to play within this range right now."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1859000","1862000"," This is rolling over right now."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1862000","1868000"," There are large banks institutions that are trying to unwind themselves from their long positions."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1868000","1874000"," I do expect NQ to hold up slightly longer than IWM."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1874000","1878000"," I even suspect that Spy doesn't fall off as soon."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1878000","1882000"," NQ is probably going to take the longest unwind."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1882000","1889000"," And we can go even deeper in here and give you some of this nice gap here that needs filled."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1889000","1893000"," And then we've got one more above here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1893000","1900000"," So by expected range for today is going to be 15701 at the top as the top."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1900000","1903000"," Possible that we go as high as 157444."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1903000","1906000"," The low for today should be 155055050."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1906000","1912000"," Any break below you're going to be looking for 15384."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1912000","1919000"," 15325 down into 15228 before there's a relief rally."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1919000","1924000"," Between now and let's say the 15th you're going to probably be looking for that 15269."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1924000","1928000"," And then some form of a relief rally in middle of September."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1928000","1937000"," Now let's look at the RUT IWM which are different but they can be translated easily."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1937000","1944000"," We talked about I remember a few weeks ago."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1944000","1949000"," I remember a few weeks ago this was you know this really happened."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1949000","1956000"," I remember a few weeks ago that people unfintuit got real bearish on IWM."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1956000","1962000"," I remember some people bought or held short here and bought puts here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1962000","1968000"," There was no absolutely no reason to stay short here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1968000","1972000"," And sure enough people got burned as we went up over here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1972000","1978000"," This is the this is relevant to everything that we do right."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1978000","1982000"," And this is the same being bullish on this chart."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1982000","1991000"," You knew that once we came up here that you should be closing your lungs and look for some confirmation that we're getting bearish again."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1991000","1995000"," And this is bearish this is a bearish look right here right."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","1995000","2000000"," We can look in the past and we've hit resistance up here we've come down right."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2000000","2003000"," We come up come up right we come down again."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2003000","2007000"," When we come up here even if we get a relief rally we still come down."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2007000","2012000"," Even if we come up we still come down right so there's nothing bullish about this."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2012000","2016000"," Even if we were to get bear our bullish today let's say we get some relief in here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2016000","2019000"," You could easily take a short here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2019000","2023000"," Heading into middle of September which is September 15."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2023000","2031000"," I would expect that we come down over this next seven days eight days these next two weeks I'm feeling pretty bearish about this position down to 209."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2031000","2035000"," This is actually a nice chart I like this so I might enter short here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2035000","2039000"," I'm going to look to be entering short somewhere in here and taking this down to 209."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2039000","2042000"," We're going to look for some kind of consolidation area in here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2042000","2053000"," And if you really wanted to get super bearish that's two oh five seven and one nine seven three I like this chart this is a nice bearish setup."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2053000","2062000"," You could take even if you had a relief rally in here you could just take a bear spread put spread and it's going to eventually or it looks like it's going to eventually print."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2062000","2065000"," It's probably a fair chance of it printing."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2065000","2069000"," We can get on a closer time frame in case any of you here yeah this looks beautiful."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2069000","2071000"," Let me just look at this."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2071000","2073000"," This is gorgeous."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2073000","2076000"," I like it."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2076000","2082000"," So we'll put some."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2082000","2087000"," Push up here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2087000","2091000"," Another push up down here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2091000","2094000"," This is beautiful right here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2094000","2101000"," So the trading range for so you can see this nice gap or there's really much gap there's some gap down in here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2101000","2114000"," You want to put this one in here so my expectations for today would be no lower than 2251.5 possible recovery rally up to 2289 any kind of recovery rally above."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2114000","2125000"," You're going to be grabbing for shorting this down to two eleven three point five or even lower down to two I would I think we're going to head down to two oh nine."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2125000","2134000"," Now you are also looking for becoming bullish on any of these indexes if we start to break above these resistance levels right."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2134000","2137000"," If you see that we push up above."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2137000","2139000"," We start to rattle around in here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2139000","2141000"," This is a neutral failing in here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2141000","2144000"," This is bullish above and this is bearish below."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2144000","2146000"," Keep that in mind as we keep moving forward."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2146000","2148000"," Let's look at Tesla."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2148000","2150000"," Gorgeous chart on Tesla."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2150000","2152000"," I don't know how many times we've drawn these."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2152000","2154000"," I know it's been a lot."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2154000","2158000"," And we've been bullish on Tesla since I think May or March."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2158000","2163000"," I think we got bullish in March and then we got real bullish way down here in May."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2163000","2167000"," I know it may start getting projections of eight hundred to a thousand."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2167000","2171000"," I think we're at seven eighty today at one point or close to it."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2171000","2177000"," I'm not positive on that but I think we got closer seven sixty and I know Mike Barry got real bearish."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2177000","2179000"," That's not doing so well for him right now."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2179000","2180000"," We know that right."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2180000","2183000"," We know that there's some resistance above there."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2183000","2187000"," So there's some major resistance up here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2187000","2190000"," Once we start getting up to the seven eighty."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2190000","2194000"," We didn't get to seven eighty yesterday but I was thinking about seven eighty."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2194000","2198000"," That's what it was because there are a lot of shorts up here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2198000","2204000"," This is the spring that actually gets you to that eight hundred and possibly a thousand."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2204000","2213000"," You've got this area here and you've got this whole area in here is kind of the no man no go zone right."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2213000","2219000"," This is where your shorts are and they do not want to see Tesla go any higher."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2219000","2223000"," If you are bearish this is a place for you to make a stand."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2223000","2228000"," I am a Tesla bull but you should be aware that while we're in this zone right here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2228000","2231000"," That this zone is a cell zone."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2231000","2238000"," This is a zone where bears will double triple down and the reason being is if they have to cover above here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2238000","2242000"," The move the next move up is somewhere around this nine hundred."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2242000","2251000"," This really does get pretty nasty to eight fifty six all the way up into nine hundred."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2251000","2256000"," This is where you start to see the next move to one thousand."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2256000","2262000"," It wouldn't surprise me to see some form of rejection in this area here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2262000","2270000"," We've been rejected in the past in this area this zone and I would be watching for some form of rejection."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2270000","2272000"," How deep does it go?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2272000","2278000"," Well we already know where our established by zone is down here right."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2278000","2286000"," We can add one more zone in so I'm a buyer anywhere below six ninety six point fourteen."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2286000","2288000"," All this is safe right now."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2288000","2294000"," I'm not going to get bearish unless we get below right now six forty point seventy seven."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2294000","2296000"," If you're going to take this bearish."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2296000","2301000"," I wouldn't be holding bear positions any deeper than six ninety five thirty seven."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2301000","2305000"," And this is going to be an interesting battleground area over here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2305000","2315000"," Let's say spy and then Q move down an IWM move down seasonally from now until let's say the call up the fifteen right."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2315000","2317000"," It's just an arbitrary date."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2317000","2323000"," You could see us be rejected in here but then have a relief rally where the rest of the market drags us up."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2323000","2326000"," To this eight fifty or this or past this eight hundred."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2326000","2332000"," Once we're past this eight hundred if we come above this eight or this seven eighty one."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2332000","2337000"," If we are able to rest above this and not lose this foothold."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2337000","2342000"," There will be a squeeze up to eight fifty six point oh eight."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2342000","2346000"," Next let's look at GME."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2346000","2352000"," I know you guys have got you guys have an report coming out just for some context."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2352000","2356000"," If you follow me or have been a longtime follower of mine."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2356000","2359000"," I am an old school Wall Street better."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2359000","2363000"," I've known about GME since last year."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2363000","2367000"," I actually took a position somewhere in December."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2367000","2369000"," In GME."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2369000","2372000"," I played this spike with this original squeeze up."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2372000","2377000"," And I played this squeeze as well but I did stop playing there after."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2377000","2382000"," I have some friends finance friends that are actually in finance."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2382000","2386000"," They all they want to see is GME go away."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2386000","2390000"," They don't want to deal with GME anymore they're going to do whatever they can."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2390000","2394000"," There's the argument that the infinity squeeze is still here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2394000","2399000"," I still prescribe somewhat to the infinity squeeze on GME."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2399000","2404000"," Though there is a lot of work being done to get rid of that squeeze."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2404000","2408000"," They're the work that's being done."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2408000","2412000"," This is the answer to a question I had on the fin tonight yesterday."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2412000","2417000"," Is what about the infinity squeeze basically is what was asked."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2417000","2422000"," And the concern is like Volkswagen."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2422000","2427000"," Porsche was going to take their Volkswagen private right and they wound up taking the"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2427000","2432000"," shares back out of the market so it couldn't be shorted any longer right."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2432000","2437000"," There couldn't be any more squeezing going on by the owners of Volkswagen taking"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2437000","2440000"," those shares or accumulating those shares."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2440000","2446000"," That is happening right now with GME being included into larger indexes."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2446000","2448000"," You'll see dilution of stock."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2448000","2455000"," You'll see stock become held from people that don't want to see the stock squeeze."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2455000","2458000"," You'll also see synthetic shares."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2458000","2464000"," You'll see all kinds of nastiness to try to stop the stock from continuing to squeeze"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2464000","2465000"," over time."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2465000","2470000"," I'm not going to compare this right now to Volkswagen but if you check the Volkswagen"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2470000","2473000"," stock back when it squows."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2473000","2476000"," I want to say it was 2008."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2476000","2481000"," It could be wrong on that date but I believe it was sometime in 2008."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2481000","2486000"," You'll see it starting to follow that same pattern as it comes down."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2486000","2491000"," Now let's say you disagree with everything I have to say on GME."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2491000","2492000"," That's fine."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2492000","2497000"," You can stay in GME for the infinity of squeeze."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2497000","2500000"," I think all power to you if you want to do that."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2500000","2510000"," My only concern with playing GME is that you have so many other places that you can be"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2510000","2517000"," investing money that I like the idea of new traders finding how to trade the stock markets"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2517000","2524000"," with GME but in reality for the rest of your life when the fact that you don't get a pension"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2524000","2526000"," or a 401k, you don't have good jobs."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2526000","2532000"," There are other ways and places that you should expand your trading into or your investing"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2532000","2539000"," into that will bring you more money than waiting for each squeeze on GME."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2539000","2544000"," Now this last one that took place in August, everyone was stoked on."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2544000","2550000"," I don't blame you for being stoked on it if you were trapped somewhere up in here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2550000","2558000"," My recommendation is that if you want to stay in GME you can for the infinity squeeze."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2558000","2563000"," They will stop it at some point even if it does infinity squeeze."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2563000","2564000"," You never really win."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2564000","2568000"," The man always wins in the end and that sucks to say."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2568000","2570000"," That is the reality of it."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2570000","2576000"," We're going to put some, we know that this is firm, this is some firm demand right down here"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2576000","2579000"," and we know we have ER coming up."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2579000","2589000"," You should also know that interest in options, waxes and wanes depending upon events, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2589000","2597000"," So you can lose holding puts and calls on an ER event no matter which direction it goes."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2597000","2606000"," Just an interest that's being lost."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2606000","2613000"," All you need is one bad event in here for this stock to break through this support."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2613000","2618000"," Know that if they announce on an ER report that they're going to dilute shares,"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2618000","2621000"," that you're going to see the stock fall drastically."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2622000","2628000"," You need to understand these things to know when it's time to enter GME and when it's time to exit GME."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2628000","2630000"," You don't want to be a buyer up here, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2630000","2632000"," You don't ever want to be a buyer up here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2632000","2637000"," You always want it to be a buyer of GME down here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2637000","2640000"," When I played GME down here there was no interest."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2640000","2646000"," There was some slight retail interest on a small subreddit called Wall Street Bets"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2646000","2652000"," at a time when I think at that time last year we only had still maybe,"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2652000","2656000"," I don't know if we had a quarter million, I think it was somewhere between 150,"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2656000","2660000"," but sometime even just before that we had only 70,000, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2660000","2665000"," Maybe 30,000 to 40,000 active users, not that many people."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2665000","2670000"," So to think that it can't come any lower is nonsense it can, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2670000","2675000"," So see how much interest is in the options game with GME."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2675000","2678000"," It's easy to not really make as much as you thought you'd make."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2678000","2682000"," There are other stocks that don't have interest that you can get involved in."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2682000","2687000"," So now all that negative out of the way, if you want to be a buyer in GME,"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2687000","2693000"," the level to be a buyer at is of course this demand line down here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2693000","2699000"," So I'm not a buyer of GME today heading into ER until we get down to this 198,"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2699000","2701000"," a 198, 65."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2701000","2707000"," I would expect some form of a sell-off as we head into the close of today down here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2707000","2710000"," If you're really looking for where's that sell-off going to be,"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2710000","2713000"," it is down here somewhere."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2713000","2718000"," It's somewhere down at 177.67, where are the sellers?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2718000","2723000"," The sellers of course are right up here right now."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2723000","2728000"," They're at 223.91 and you can see, right, we're sitting, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2728000","2732000"," In place, the market makers have placed it right in the middle here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2732000","2736000"," We'll change this to a green."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2736000","2740000"," That's not even color. We'll change it to blue or something."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2740000","2742000"," So there you go."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2742000","2744000"," These are where your buyers are."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2744000","2746000"," These are where your sellers are, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2746000","2749000"," Let's say you have some good news. How far above will you go?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2749000","2752000"," Well, you already know that you've got some sellers here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2752000","2755000"," You already know how high we can get, right?"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2755000","2759000"," So we'll actually change this for safety's sake."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2759000","2762000"," We're going to put sellers, trapped sellers up here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2762000","2764000"," We know we have trapped people up here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2764000","2768000"," We're going to put it somewhere right here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2768000","2773000"," This is where people that are currently trapped from this last bush,"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2773000","2775000"," they're telling themselves,"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2775000","2779000"," if we could just get back to 266.18, I'll sell up."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2779000","2782000"," That doesn't mean we don't reject."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2782000","2787000"," But we might reject, come back down to 229 and then shoot back up."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2787000","2790000"," But you're looking for to exhaust these sellers here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2790000","2796000"," And then you're going to look for the next one to be slightly above"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2796000","2798000"," the 299.86."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2798000","2801000"," So I'm not a buyer until we come down here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2801000","2806000"," If there's any negative news, I'm really not a buyer until"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2806000","2811000"," probably 118.23, depending on how bad the news is."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2811000","2814000"," These two right here would be if there's bad news,"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2814000","2816000"," you're looking for this right here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2816000","2818000"," All right, I hope this helps all of you apes."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2818000","2821000"," I hope that you guys make lots of money."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2821000","2825000"," If you think I'm being negative on GME, please don't."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2825000","2827000"," I support all of you 100%."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2827000","2829000"," I understand where you're coming from."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2829000","2830000"," I get it."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2830000","2833000"," So I do wish you luck today or at the end of the day in GME."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2833000","2840000"," This might be a nice play in here is to take some form of a straddle"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2840000","2845000"," or a strangle heading into ER today."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2845000","2849000"," Or even waiting until after ER or maybe the last five minutes."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2849000","2852000"," I feel like I'm just a bull and I want to get bullish."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2852000","2856000"," You might want to wait until the last right up till close to buy some"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2856000","2857000"," lungs."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2857000","2861000"," If you're a bearish, you might want to wait until I move up today."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2861000","2865000"," If you get to 221 and you want to grab some puts, you're going to wait"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2865000","2867000"," to grab your puts up here."
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2867000","2871000"," If you want to go strangle or a straddle, you're going to hope that"
"QV7Ooh7RY0M","2871000","2875000"," today we go up to grab some puts here and then a sell off down here to"
